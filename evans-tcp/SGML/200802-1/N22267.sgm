<P>ON the plea&s;ant banks of the Garonne, in the province of Ga&s;cony, &s;tood, in the year 1584, the chateau of Mon&s;ieur St. Aubert. From its windows were &s;een the pa&s;toral land|&s;capes of Guienne and Ga&s;cony, &s;tretching along the river, gay with luxuriant woods and vines, and plantations of olives. To the &s;outh, the view was bounded by the maje&s;tic Pyrenees, who&s;e &s;ummits, veiled in clouds, or exhibiting awful forms, &s;een and lo&s;t again, as the partial vapours rolled along, were &s;ometimes barren, and gleamed through the blue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inge of air, and &s;ometimes frowned with fore&s;ts of gloomy pine, that &s;wept downward to their ba&s;e. The&s;e tremendous precipices were contra&s;ted by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> green of the pa&s;tures and woods that hung upon their &s;kirts; among who&s;e flocks, and herds and &s;imple cottages, the eye, after having &s;caled the cliffs above, delighted to repo&s;e. To the north, and to the ea&s;t; the plains of Guienne and Languedoc were lo&s;t in the mi&s;t of di&s;tance; on the we&s;t Ga&s;cony was bounded by the waters of Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with his wife and daughter, on the margin of the Garonne, and to li&s;ten to the mu&s;ic that floated on its waves. He had known life in other forms than
<PB N="4" REF="029378_0003_0FE07CFF03B4B330">
tho&s;e of pa&s;toral &s;implicity, having mingled in the gay and in the bu&s;y &s;cenes of the world; but the flattering portrait of mankind, which his heart had delineated in early youth, his experience had too &s;orrowfully corrected. Yet, amid&s;t the changing vi&s;ions of life, his principles remained un&s;haken, his benevolence unchilled; and he retired from the multitude more in <HI>pity</HI> than in anger," to &s;cenes of &s;imple nature, to the pure delights of literature, and to the exerci&s;e of dome&s;tic virtues.</P>
<P>He was a de&s;cendant from the younger branch of an illu&s;|trious family, and it was de&s;igned, that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth &s;hould be &s;upplied either by a &s;plendid al|liance in marriage, or by &s;ucce&s;s in the intrigues of public af|fairs. But St. Aubert had too nice a &s;en&s;e of honour to ful|fil the latter hope, and too &s;mall a portion of ambition to &s;a|crifice what he called happine&s;s, to the attainment of wealth. After the death of his father he married a very amiable woman, his equal in birth, and not his &s;uperior in fortune. The late Mon&s;ieur St. Aubert's liberality, or extravagance, had &s;o much involved his affairs, that his &s;on found it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;po&s;e of a part of the family domain, and, &s;ome years after his mar|riage, he &s;old it to Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel, the brother of his wife, and retired to a &s;mall e&s;tate in Ga&s;cony, where conjugal feli|city, and parental duties, divided his attention with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he trea|&s;ures of knowledge and the illuminations of genius.</P>
<P>To this &s;pot he had been attached from his infancy. He had often made excur&s;ions to it when a boy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> oppre&s;|&s;ions of delight given to his mind by the homely kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the grey-headed pea&s;ant, to whom it was intru&s;ted, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fruit and cream never failed, had not been obliterated by &s;uc|ceeding circum&s;tances. The green pa&s;tures along which he had &s;o often bounded in the exultation of health, and youthful freedom&mdash;the woods, under who&s;e refre&s;hing &s;hade he had fir&s;t indulged that pen&s;ive melancholy, which afterwards made a &s;trong feature of his character&mdash;the wild walks of the moun|tains, the river, on who&s;e waves he had floated, and the di&s;tant plains, which &s;eemed boundle&s;s as his early hopes&mdash;were ne|ver after remembered by St. Aubert but with enthu&s;ia&s;m and regret. At length he di&s;engaged him&s;elf from the world, and retired hither, to realize the wi&s;hes of many years.</P>
<P>The building, as it then &s;tood, was merely a &s;ummer cot|tage, rendered intere&s;ting to a &s;tranger by its neat &s;implicity, or the beauty of the &s;urrounding &s;cene; and con&s;iderable ad|ditions
<PB N="5" REF="029378_0003_0FE07CFF03B4B330">
were nece&s;&s;ary to make it a comfortable family re&s;i|dence. St. Aubert felt a kind of affection for every part of the fabric, which he remembered in his youth, and would not &s;uffer a &s;tone of it to be removed, &s;o that the new building, adapted to the &s;tyle of the old one, formed with it only a &s;im|ple and elegant re&s;idence. The ta&s;te of Madame St. Aubert was con&s;picuous in its internal fini&s;hing, where the &s;ame cha&s;te &s;implicity was ob&s;ervable in the furniture, and in the few orna|ments of the apartments, that characteri&s;ed the manners of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>The library occupied the we&s;t &s;ide of the chateau, and was enriched by a collection of the be&s;t books in the ancient and modern languages. This room opened upon a grove, which &s;tood on the brow of a gentle declivity, that fell towards the river, and the tall trees gave it a melancholy and plea&s;ing &s;hade; while from the windows the eye caught, beneath the &s;preading branches, the gay and luxuriant land&s;cape &s;tretching to the we&s;t and overlooked on the left by the bold precipices of the Pyrenees. Adjoining the library was a green-hou&s;e, &s;tored with &s;carce and beautiful plants; for one of the amu&s;ements of St. Aubert was the &s;tudy of botany, and among the neigh|bouring mountains, which afforded a luxurious fea&s;t to the mind of the naturali&s;t, he often pa&s;&s;ed the day in the pur&s;uits of his favourite &s;cience. He was &s;ometimes accompanied in the&s;e little excur&s;ions by Madame St. Aubert, and frequently by his daughter; when, with a &s;mall o&s;ier ba&s;ket to receive plants, and another filled with cold refre&s;hments, &s;uch as the cabin of the &s;hepherd did not afford, they wandered away among the mo&s;t romantic and magnificent &s;cenes, nor &s;uffered the charms of Nature's lowly children to ab&s;tract them from the ob&s;ervance of her &s;tupendous works. When weary of &s;auntering among cliffs that &s;eemed &s;carcely acce&s;&s;ible but to the &s;teps of the enthu&s;ia&s;t, and where no track appeared on the vegetation, but what the foot of the izard had left; they would &s;eek one of tho&s;e green rece&s;&s;es, which &s;o beautifully adorn the bo&s;om of the&s;e mountains, where, under the &s;hade of the lofty larch, or cedar, they enjoyed their &s;imple repa&s;t, made &s;weeter by the waters of the cool &s;tream, that crept along the turf, and by the breath of wild flowers and aromatic plants that fringed the rocks, and inlaid the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Adjoining the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the green hou&s;e, looking to|wards the plains of Languedoc, was a room which Emily called
<PB N="6" REF="029378_0004_0FE07D03AA60F7F0">
hers, and which contained her books, her drawings, her mu|&s;ical in&s;truments, with &s;ome favourite birds and plants. Here &s;he u&s;ually exerci&s;ed her&s;elf in elegant arts, cultivated only becau&s;e they were congenial to her ta&s;te, and in which native genius, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the in&s;tructions of Mon&s;ieur and Madame St. Aubert, made her an early proficient. The windows of this room were particularly plea&s;ant; they de&s;cended to the floor, and, opening upon the little lawn that &s;urrounded the hou&s;e, the eye was led between groves of almond, palm-trees, flower|ing-a&s;h, and myrtle, to the di&s;tant-land&s;cape, where the Ga|ronne wandered.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants of this gay climate were often &s;een on an evening, when the day's labour was done, dancing in groups on the margin of the river. Their &s;prightly melodies, <HI>de|bonnaire</HI> &s;teps, the fanciful figure of their dances, with the ta&s;teful and capricious manner in which the girls adju&s;ted their &s;imple dre&s;s, gave a character to the &s;cene entirely French.</P>
<P>The front of the chateau, which, having a &s;outhern a&s;pect, opened upon the grandeur of the mountains, was occupied on the ground floor by a ru&s;tic hall, and two excellent &s;itting rooms. The fir&s;t floor, for the cottage had no &s;econd &s;tory, was laid out in bed chambers, except one apartment that open|ed to a balcony, and which was generally u&s;ed for a breakfa&s;t room.</P>
<P>In the &s;urrounding ground, St. Aubert had made very ta&s;teful improvements; yet, &s;uch was his attachment to ob|jects he had remembered from his boyi&s;h days, that he had in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;acrificed ta&s;te to &s;entiment. There were two old latches that &s;haded the building, and interrupted the pro&s;pect; St. Aubert had &s;ometimes declared that he believed he &s;hould have been weak enough to have wept at their fall. In addition to the&s;e larches he planted a little grove of beech, pine, and mountain-a&s;h. On a lofty terrace, formed by the &s;welling bank of the river, ro&s;e a plantation of orange, lemon and palm-trees, who&s;e fruit, in the coolne&s;s of evening, breathed delicious fragrance. With the&s;e were mingled a few trees of other &s;pecies. Here under the ample &s;hade of a plane-tree, that &s;pread its maje&s;tic canopy towards the river, St. Aubert loved to &s;it in the fine evenings of &s;ummer, with his wife and children, watching, beneath its foilage, the &s;etting &s;un, the mild &s;plendour of its light fading from the di&s;tant land&s;cape,
<PB N="7" REF="029378_0004_0FE07D03AA60F7F0">
till the &s;hadows of twilight melted its various features into one tint of &s;ober gray. Here, too, he loved to read, and to con|ver&s;e with Madame St. Aubert; or to play with his children, re&s;igning him&s;elf to the influence of tho&s;e &s;weet affections, which are ever attendant on &s;implicity and nature. He has often &s;aid, while tears of plea&s;ure trembled in his eyes, that the&s;e were moments infinitely more delightful than any pa&s;&s;ed amid the brilliant and tumultuous &s;cenes that are courted by the world. His heart was occupied; it had, what can be &s;o rarely &s;aid, no wi&s;h for a happine&s;s beyond what it experienced. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of acting right diffu&s;ed a &s;erenity over his manners, which nothing el&s;e could impart to a man of moral perceptions like his, and which refined his &s;en&s;e of every &s;ur|rounding ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The deepe&s;t &s;hade of twilight did not &s;end him from his fa|vourite plane-tree. He loved the &s;oothing hour, when the la&s;t tints of light die away; when the &s;tars, one by one, tremble through aether, and are reflected on the dark mirror of the wa|ters; that hour, which, of all others, in&s;pires the mind with pen&s;ive tenderne&s;s, and often elevates it to &s;ublime contempla|tion. When the moon &s;hed her &s;oft rays among the foilage, he &s;till lingered, and his pa&s;toral &s;upper of cream and fruits was often &s;pread beneath it. Then, on the &s;tillne&s;s of night, came the &s;ong of the nightingale, breathing &s;weetne&s;s, and awakening melancholy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t interruptions to the happine&s;s he had known &s;ince his retirement, were occa&s;ioned by the death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his two &s;ons. He loft them at that age when infantine &s;implicity is &s;o fa&s;cin|ating; and though, in con&s;ideration of Madame St. Aubert's di&s;tre&s;s, he re&s;trained the expre&s;&s;ion of his own, and endeavoured to bear it, as he meant, with philo&s;ophy, he had, in truth, no philo&s;ophy that could render him calm to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es. One daughter was now his only &s;urviving child; and, while he watched the unfolding of her infant character, with anxious fondne&s;s, he endeavoured, with unremitting effort, to counteract tho&s;e traits in her di&s;po&s;ition, which might hereafter lead her from happine&s;s. She had di&s;covered in her early years uncom|mon delicacy of mind, warm affections, and ready benevolence; but with the&s;e was ob&s;ervable a degree of &s;u&s;ceptibility too exqui&s;ite to admit of la&s;ting peace. As &s;he advanced in youth, this &s;en&s;ibility gave a pen&s;ive tone to her &s;pirits, and a &s;oftne&s;s to her manner, which added grace to beauty, and rendered her
<PB N="8" REF="029378_0005_0FE07D0E25CC3178">
a very intere&s;ting object to per&s;ons of a congenial di&s;po&s;ition. But St. Aubert had too much good &s;en&s;e to prefer a charm to a virtue; and had penetration enough to &s;ee, that this charm was too dangerous to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to be allowed the character of a ble&s;&s;ing. He endeavoured, therefore, to &s;trengthen her mind; to enure her to habits of &s;elf-command; to teach her to reject the fir&s;t impul&s;e of her feelings, and to look, with cool examination, upon the di&s;appointments he &s;ometimes threw in her way. While he in&s;tructed her to re&s;i&s;t fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and to acquire that &s;teady dignity of mind, that can alone counter|balance the pa&s;&s;ions, and bear us, as far as is compatible with our nature, above the reach of circum&s;tances, he taught him&s;elf a le&s;&s;on of fortitude; for he was often obliged to witne&s;s, with &s;eeming indifference, the tears and &s;truggles which his caution occa&s;ioned her.</P>
<P>In per&s;on, Emily re&s;embled her mother; having the &s;ame elegant &s;ymmetry of form, the &s;ame delicacy of features, and the &s;ame blue eyes, full of tender &s;weetne&s;s. But, lovely as was her per&s;on, it was the varied expre&s;&s;ion of her counte|nance, as conver&s;ation awakened the nicer emotions of her mind, that threw &s;uch a captivating grace around her:
<Q><L>"Tho&s;e tend'rer tints, that &s;hun the carele&s;s eye,</L>
<L>And, in the world's contagious circle, die."</L></Q></P>
<P>St. Aubert cultivated her under&s;tanding with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care. He gave her a general view of the &s;ciences, and an exact acquaintance with every part of elegant lite|rature. He taught her Latin and Engli&s;h, chiefly that &s;he might under&s;tand the &s;ublimity of their be&s;t poets. She di&s;|covered in her early years of ta&s;te for works of genius; and it was St. Aubert's principle, as well as his inclination, to promote every innocent means of happine&s;s. "A well-in|formed mind," he would &s;ay, "is the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t the contagion of folly and of vice. The vacant mind is ever on the watch for relief, and ready of plunge into error, to e&s;cape from the languor of idlene&s;s. Store it with ideas, teach it the plea&s;ure of thinking; and the temptations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the world without, will be counteracted by the gratification <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rived from the world within. Thought, and cultivation, are nece&s;&s;ary equally to the happine&s;s of a country and a city life; in the fir&s;t they prevent the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations of indolence, and afford a &s;ublime plea&s;ure in the ta&s;te they create for the beautiful, and
<PB N="9" REF="029378_0005_0FE07D0E25CC3178">
the grand; in the latter, they make di&s;&s;ipation le&s;s an object of nece&s;&s;ity, and con&s;equently of intere&s;t."</P>
<P>It was one of Emily's earlie&s;t plea&s;ures to ramble among the &s;cenes of nature; nor was it in the &s;oft and glowing land&s;cape that &s;he mo&s;t delighted; &s;he loved more the wild wood-walks, that &s;kirted the mountain; and &s;till more the mountain's &s;tu|pendous rece&s;&s;es, where the &s;ilence and grandeur of &s;olitude impre&s;&s;ed a &s;acred awe upon her heart, and lifted her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. In &s;cenes like the&s;e &s;he would often linger alone, wrapt in a melancholy charm, till the la&s;t gleam of day faded from the we&s;t; till the lonely &s;ound of a &s;heep-bell, or the di&s;tant bark of a watch-dog, were all that broke on the &s;tillne&s;s of the evening. Then, the gloom of the woods; the trembling of their leaves, at intervals, in the breeze; the bat, flitting on the twilight; the cottage-lights, now &s;een, and now lo&s;t&mdash;were circum&s;tances that awakened her mind into effort, and led to enthu&s;ia&s;m and poetry.</P>
<P>Her favourite walk was to a little fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, belonging to St. Aubert, in a woody-glen, on the margin of a rivulet that de&s;cended from the Pyrenees, and, after foaming among their rocks, wound its &s;ilent way beneath the &s;hades it reflected.&mdash;Above the woods, that &s;creened this glen, ro&s;e the lofty &s;um|mits of the Pyrenees, which often bur&s;t boldly on the eye through the glades below. Sometimes the &s;hattered face of a rock only was &s;een, crowned with wild &s;hrubs; or a &s;hepherd's cabin &s;eated on a cliff, over&s;hadowed by dark cypre&s;s, or waving a&s;h. Emerging from the deep rece&s;&s;es of the woods, the glade opened to the di&s;tant land&s;cape, where the rich pa&s;tures and vine-covered &s;lopes of Ga&s;cony gradually declined to the plains; and there, on the winding &s;hores of the Garonne, groves, and hamlets, and villas, their outlines &s;oftened by di&s;tance, melted from the eye into one rich harmonious tint.</P>
<P>This, too, was the favourite retreat of St. Aubert, to which he frequently withdrew from the fervour of noon, with his wife, his daughter, and his books; or came at the &s;weet even|ing hour to welcome the &s;ilent du&s;k, or to li&s;ten for the mu&s;ic of the nightingale. Sometimes, too, he brought mu&s;ic of his own, and awakened every fairy echo with the tender ac|cents of his oboe; and often have the tones of Emily's voice drawn &s;weetne&s;s from the waves, over which they trembled.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="029378_0006_0FE07D140F59D328">
It was in one of her excur&s;ions to this &s;pot, that &s;he ob&s;erv|ed the following lines written with a pencil on a part of the wain&s;cot:</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>Go, pencil! faithful to thy ma&s;ter's &s;ighs!</L>
<L>Go&mdash;tell the Godde&s;s of this fairy &s;cene,</L>
<L>When next her light &s;teps wind the&s;e wood-walks green,</L>
<L>Whence all his tears, his render &s;orrows, ri&s;e:</L>
<L>Ah! paint her form, her &s;oul-illumin'd eyes,</L>
<L>The &s;weet expre&s;&s;ion of her pen&s;ive face,</L>
<L>The light'ning &s;mile, the animated grace&mdash;</L>
<L>The portrait well the lover's voice &s;upplies:</L>
<L>Speaks all his heart mu&s;t feel, his tongue would &s;ay:</L>
<L>Yet ah&punc; not all his heart mu&s;t &s;adly feel!</L>
<L>How oft the flow'ret's &s;ilken leaves conceal</L>
<L>The drug that &s;teals the vital &s;park away!</L>
<L>And who that gazes on that angel-&s;mile,</L>
<L>Would fear its charm, or think it could beguile!</L>
</LG>
<P>The&s;e lines were not in&s;cribed to any per&s;on; Emily there|fore could not apply them to her&s;elf, though &s;he was undoubt|edly the nymph of the&s;e &s;hades. Having glanced round the little circle of her acquaintance without being detained by a &s;u&s;picion as to whom they could be addre&s;&s;ed, &s;he was com|pelled to re&s;t in uncertainty; an uncertainty which would have been more painful to an idle mind than it was to hers.&mdash;She had no lei&s;ure to &s;uffer this circum&s;tance, trifling at fir&s;t to &s;well into importance by frequent remembrance. The little vanity it had excited (for the incertitude which forbade her to pre&s;ume upon having in&s;pired the &s;onnet, forbade her al&s;o to di&s;believe it) pa&s;&s;ed away, and the incident was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from her thoughts amid her books, her &s;tudies, and the exerci&s;e of &s;ocial charities.</P>
<P>Soon after this period, her anxiety was awakened by the in|di&s;po&s;ition of her father, who was attacked with a fever; which, though not thought to be of a dangerous kind, gave a &s;evere &s;hock to his con&s;titution. Madame St. Aubert and Em|ily attended him with unremitting care; but his recovery was very &s;low, and as he advanced towards health, Madame &s;eemed to decline.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;cene he vi&s;ited, after he was well enough to take the air, was his favourite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e.

<P>After employing him&s;elf, for about an hour, in botanizing, dinner was &s;erved. It was a repa&s;t, to which gratitude, for being again permitted to vi&s;it this &s;pot, gave &s;weetne&s;s; and family happine&s;s once more &s;miled beneath the&s;e &s;hades.&mdash;Mon&s;ieur St. Aubert conver&s;ed with unu&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s; ev|ery object delighted his &s;en&s;es. The refre&s;hing plea&s;ure from the fir&s;t view of nature, after the pain of illne&s;s, and the con|finement of a &s;ick-chamber, is above the conceptions, as well as the de&s;criptions, of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e in health. The green woods and pa&s;tures; the flowery turf; the blue concave of the heavens; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> balmy air; the murmur of the limped &s;tream; and even the hum of every little in&s;ect of the &s;hade, &s;eem to revivify th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;oul, and make mere exi&s;tence bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Madame St. Aubert, reanimated by the cheerfulne&s;s and recovery of her hu&s;band, was no longer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the indi&s;po|&s;ition which had lately oppre&s;&s;ed her; and, as &s;he &s;auntered along the wood-walks of this romantic glen, and conver&s;ed with him, and with her daughter, &s;he often looked at them alternately with a degree of tenderne&s;s, that filled her eyes with tears. St. Aubert ob&s;erved this more than once, and gently reproved her for the emotion; but &s;he could only &s;mile, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his hand, and that of Emily, and weep the more. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the tender enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;tealing upon him&s;elf in a degree that became almo&s;t painful; his features a&s;&s;umed a &s;erious air, and he could not forbear &s;ecretly &s;ighing&mdash;"Perhaps I &s;hall &s;ome time look back to the&s;e moments, as to the &s;ummit of my happi|ne&s;s, with hopele&s;s regret. But let me not mi&s;u&s;e them by u&s;ele&s;s anticipation; let me hope I &s;hall not live to mourn the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who are dearer to me than life."</P>
<P>To relieve, or perhaps to indulge, the pen&s;ive temper of his mind, he bade Emily fetch the lute &s;he knew how to touch with &s;uch &s;weet pathos. As &s;he drew near the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear the tones of the in&s;trument, which were awakened by the hand of ta&s;te, and uttered a plaintive air, who&s;e exqui&s;ite melody engaged all her attention. She li&s;tened in profound &s;ilence, afraid to move from the &s;pot, le&s;t the &s;ound of her &s;teps &s;hould occa&s;ion her to lo&s;e a note of the mu&s;ic, or &s;hould di&s;turb the mu&s;ician. Every thing without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he building was &s;till, and no per&s;on appeared. She continued to li&s;ten, till timidity &s;ucceeded to &s;urpri&s;e and delight; a

timidity, increa&s;ed by a remembrance of the pencilled lines &s;he had formerly &s;een, and &s;he he&s;itated whether to proceed, or to return.</P>
<P>While &s;he pau&s;ed, the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed; and, after a momentary he&s;itation, &s;he recollected courage to advance to the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, which &s;he entered with faltering &s;teps, and found unoccu|pied! Her lute lay on the table; every thing &s;eemed undi&s;tur|bed, and &s;he began to believe it was another in&s;trument &s;he had heard, till &s;he remembered, that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> followed M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Madame St. Aubert from this &s;pot, her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was left on a win|dow &s;eat. She felt alarmed yet knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wherefore; the melancholy gloom of evening, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tillne&s;s of the place, interrupted only by the light trembling of leave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> heightened her fanciful apprehen&s;ions, and &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> quitting the building, but perceived her&s;elf grow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;at down. As &s;he tried to recover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he pencilled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the wain&s;cot met her eye; &s;he &s;tarted, as if &s;he had &s;een a &s;tranger; but, endeavouring to conquer the tremour of her &s;pirits, ro&s;e and went to the window. To the lines before no|ticed &s;he now perceived that others were added, in which her name appeared.</P>
<P>Though no longer &s;uffered to doubt that they were addre&s;&s;ed to her&s;elf, &s;he was as ignorant, as before, by whom they could be written. While &s;he mu&s;ed, &s;he thought &s;he heard the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a &s;tep without the building, and again alarmed, &s;he caught up her lute, and hurried away. Mon&s;ieur and Madame St. Aubert &s;he found in a little path that wound along the &s;ides of the glen.</P>
<P>Having reached a green &s;ummit, &s;hadowed by palm-trees, and overlooking the vallies and plains of Ga&s;cony, they &s;eated them&s;elves on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and while their eyes wandered over the glorious &s;cene, and they inhaled the &s;weet breath of flow|ers and herbs that enriched the gra&s;s, Emily played and &s;ung &s;everal of their favourite airs, with the delicacy of ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;&s;ion in which &s;he &s;o much excelled.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic and conver&s;ation detained them in this enchanting &s;pot, till the &s;un's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> light &s;lept upon the plains; till the white &s;ails that glided beneath, &s;he mountains, where the Garonne wandered, became dim, and the gloom of evening &s;tole over the land&s;cape. It was a melancholy but not unplea&s;ing gloom. St. Aubert and his family ro&s;e, and left the place with regret; alas! Madame St. Aubert knew not that &s;he left it forever.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="029378_0007_0FE07D22D0E4D828">
When they reached the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e &s;he mi&s;&s;ed her bracelet, and recollected that &s;he had taken it from her arm after din|ner, and had left it on the table when &s;he went to walk. After a long &s;earch, in which Emily was very active, &s;he was com|pelled to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the lo&s;s of it. What made this bracelet valuable to her was a miniature of her daughter to which it was attached, e&s;teemed a &s;triking re&s;emblance, and which had been painted only a few months before. When Emily was convinced that the bracelet was really gone, &s;he blu&s;hed and became thoughtful. That &s;ome &s;tranger had been in the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e during her ab&s;ence, her lute, and the addi|tional lines of a pencil, had already informed her: from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rport of the&s;e lines it was not unrea&s;onable to believe, that the poet, the mu&s;ician, and the thief, were the &s;ame per&s;on.&mdash;But though the mu&s;ic &s;he had heard, the written lines &s;he had &s;een, and the di&s;appearance of the picture formed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> combina|tion of circum&s;tances very remarkable, &s;he was irre&s;i&s;tibly re|&s;trained from mentioning them; &s;ecretly determining, however, never again to vi&s;it the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e without Mon&s;ieur or Mad|ame St. Aubert.</P>
<P>They returned pen&s;ively to the chateau, Emily mu&s;ing on the incident which had ju&s;t occurred; St. Aubert reflecting, with placid gratitude, on the ble&s;&s;ings he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and Madame St. Aubert &s;omewhat di&s;turbed and perplexed, by the lo&s;s of her daughter's picture. As they drew near the hou&s;e, they ob&s;erved an unu&s;ual bu&s;tle about it; the &s;ound of voices was di&s;tinctly heard, &s;ervants and hor&s;es were &s;een pa&s;&s;ing between the trees, and, at length, the wheels of a carriage rolled along. Having come within view of the front of the chateau, a landau, with &s;moking hor&s;es, appeared on the little lawn before it. St. Aubert perceived the liveries of his brother-in-law, and in the parlour he found Mon&s;ieur and Madame Que&s;nel already en|tered. They had left Paris &s;ome days before, and were on the way to their e&s;tate, only ten leagues di&s;tant from La Vallee, and which Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel had purcha&s;ed &s;everal years be|fore of St. Aubert. This gentleman was the only brother of Madame St. Aubert: but the ties of relation&s;hip having never been &s;trengthened by congeniality of character, the intercour&s;e between them had not been frequent. M. Que&s;nel had lived altogether in the world; his aim had been con&s;equence; &s;plen|dour was the object of his ta&s;te; and his addre&s;s and know|ledge of character had carried him forward to the attainment
<PB N="14" REF="029378_0008_0FE07D276C5292A8">
of almo&s;t all that he had courted. By a man of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition; it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the virtues of St. Aubert &s;hould be overlooked; or that his pure ta&s;te, &s;implicity, and moderated wi&s;hes, were con&s;idered as marks of a weak intellect, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> confined views. The marriage of his &s;i&s;ter with St. Aubert had been mortifying to his ambition, for he had de&s;igned that the matrimonial connection &s;he formed &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the con&s;equence which he &s;o much de&s;ired; and &s;ome offers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> made by per&s;ons who&s;e rank and fortune flattered his warme&s;t hope. But his &s;i&s;ter, who was then addre&s;&s;ed also by St. Aubert perceived, or thought &s;he perceived, that happine&s;s and &s;plendour were not the &s;ame, and &s;he did not he&s;itate to forego the la&s;t for the attainment of the former. Whether Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel thought them the &s;ame, or not, he would readily have &s;acrificed his &s;i&s;ter's peace to the gratification of his own ambition; and, on her marriage with St. Aubert, expre&s;&s;ed in private his con|tempt of her &s;piritle&s;s conduct, and of the connection which it permitted. Madame St. Aubert, though &s;he concealed this in&s;ult from her hu&s;band, felt, perhaps, for the fir&s;t time, re&s;ent|ment lighted in her heart; and, though a regard for her own dig|nity, united with con&s;iderations of prudence, re&s;trained her expre&s;|&s;ion of this re&s;entment, there was ever after a mild re&s;erve in her manner towards M. Que&s;nel, which he both under&s;tood and felt.</P>
<P>In his own marriage he did not follow his &s;i&s;ter's example.&mdash;His lady was an Italian, and an heire&s;s by birth; and, by nature and education, was a vain and frivolous woman.</P>
<P>They now determined to pa&s;s the night with St. Aubert; and as the chateau was not large enough to accommodate their &s;ervants, the latter were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to the neighbouring village. When the fir&s;t compliments were over, and the arrangements for the night made, M. Que&s;nel began the di&s;play of his intelligence and his connections; while St. Aubert, who had been long enough in retirement to find the&s;e topics recommended by their novelty, li&s;tened, with a degree of patience and attention, which his gue&s;t mi&s;took for the humility of wonder. The latter, indeed, de|&s;cribed the few fe&s;tivities which the turbulence of that period permitted to the court of Henry the Third, with a minutene&s;s, that &s;omewhat recompen&s;ed for his o&s;tentation; but, when he came to &s;peak of the character of the Duke de Joyeu&s;e, of a &s;e|cret treaty, which he knew to be negociating with the Porte, and of the light in which Henry of Navarre was received, M. St. Aubert recollected enough of his former experience to be a&s;|&s;ured, that his gue&s;t could be only of an inferior cla&s;s of politi|cians;
<PB N="15" REF="029378_0008_0FE07D276C5292A8">
and that, from the importance of the &s;ubjects upon which he committed him&s;elf, he could not be of the rank to which he pretended to belong. The opinions delivered by M. Que&s;nel, were &s;uch as St. Aubert forbore to reply to, for he knew that his gue&s;t had neither humanity to feel, nor di&s;cernment to perceive what is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Madame Que&s;nel, meanwhile, was expre&s;&s;ing to Madame St. Aubert her a&s;toni&s;hment, that &s;he could bear to pa&s;s her life in this remote corner of the world, as &s;he called it, and de&s;cribing, from a wi&s;h, probably, of exciting envy, the &s;plendour of the balls, banquets, and proce&s;&s;ions which had ju&s;t been given by the court, in honour of the nuptials of the Duke de Joyeu&s;e with Margaretta of Lorrain, the &s;i&s;ter of the Queen. She de&s;cribed with equal minutene&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> magnificence &s;he had &s;een, and that from which &s;he had been excluded; while Emily's vivid fancy, as &s;he li&s;tened with the ardent curio&s;ity of youth, heightened the &s;cenes &s;he heard of; and Madame St. Aubert, looking on her family, felt, as a tear &s;tole to her eye, that though &s;plendour may grace happine&s;s, virtue only can be&s;tow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>"It is now twelve years, St. Aubert," &s;aid M. Que&s;nel, "&s;ince I purcha&s;ed your family e&s;tate."&mdash;"Somewhere there|about," replied St. Aubert, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a &s;igh. "It is near five years &s;ince I have been there," re&s;umed Que&s;nel, "for Paris and its neighbourhood is the only place in the world to live in, and I am &s;o immer&s;ed in politics, and have &s;o many affairs of mo|ment on my hands, that I find it difficult to &s;teal away even for a month or two." St. Aubert remaining &s;ilent, M. Que&s;nel pro|ceeded: "I have &s;ometimes wondered how you, who have lived in the capital, and have been accu&s;tomed to company, can exi&s;t el&s;ewhere; e&s;pecially in &s;o remote a country as this, where you can neither hear nor &s;ee any thing, and can in &s;hort be &s;carcely con&s;cious of life."</P>
<P>"I live for my family and my&s;elf," &s;aid St. Aubert; "I am now contented to know only happine&s;s;&mdash;formerly I knew life."</P>
<P>"I mean to expend thirty or forty thou&s;and livres on im|provements," &s;aid M. Que&s;nel without &s;eeming to notice the words of St. Aubert; "for I de&s;ign, next &s;ummer, to bring here my friends, the Duke de Durefort and the Marquis Ramont, to pa&s;s a month or two with me." To St. Aubert's, inquiry, as to the&s;e intended improvements, he replied, that he &s;hould take down the old ea&s;t wing of the chateau, and rai&s;e upon the &s;ite a &s;et of &s;tables. "Then I &s;hall build," &s;aid he, "<HI>a &s;alle &agrave; man|ger,</HI> a <HI>&s;alon,</HI> a <HI>&s;alle au commune,</HI> and a number of rooms for &s;er|vants;
<PB N="16" REF="029378_0009_0FE07D37153A5B50">
for at pre&s;ent there is not accommodation for a third part of my own people."</P>
<P>"It accommodated our father's hou&s;ehold," &s;aid St. Aubert, grieved that the old man&s;ion was to be thus improved, "and that was not a &s;mall one."</P>
<P>"Our notions are &s;omewhat enlarged &s;ince tho&s;e days," &s;aid M. Que&s;nel;&mdash;"what was then thought a decent &s;tyle of living would not now be endured." Even the calm St. Aubert blu&s;hed at the&s;e words, but his anger &s;oon yielded to contempt. "The ground about the chateau is encumbered with trees; I mean to cut &s;ome of them down."</P>
<P>"Cut down the trees too!" &s;aid St. Aubert.</P>
<P>"Certainly. Why &s;hould I not? they interrupt my pro&s;pects. There is a che&s;nut which &s;preads its branches before the whole &s;outh &s;ide of the chateau, and which is &s;o ancient that they tell me the hollow of its trunk will hold a dozen men. Your enthu&s;i|a&s;m will &s;carcely contend that there can be either u&s;e or beauty, in &s;uch a &s;aple&s;s old tree as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed St. Aubert, "you &s;urely will not de&s;troy that noble che&s;nut, which has flouri&s;hed for centuries, the glory of the e&s;tate! It was in its maturity when the pre&s;ent man&s;ion was built. How often, in my youth, I have climed among its broad branches, and &s;at embowered amid&s;t a world of leaves, while the heavy &s;hower has pattered above, and not a rain drop reached me! How often I have &s;at with a book in my hand, &s;ometimes reading, and &s;ometimes looking out between the branches upon the wide land&s;cape, and the &s;etting &s;un, till twilight came, and brought the birds home to their little ne&s;ts among the leaves! How often&mdash;but pardon me," added St. Aubert, recollecting that he was &s;peaking to a man who could neither comprehend, nor allow for his feelings, "I am talking of times and feelings as old-fa&s;hioned as the ta&s;te that would &s;pare that venerable tree."</P>
<P>"It will certainly come down," &s;aid M. Que&s;nel; "I be|lieve I &s;hall plant &s;ome Lombardy poplars among the clumps of che&s;nut, that I &s;hall leave of the avenue; Madame Que&s;nel is partial to the poplar, and tells me how much it adorns a villa of her uncle, not far from Venice."</P>
<P>"On the banks of the Brenta, indeed," continued St. Aubert, "where its &s;piry form is intermingled with the pine, and the cypre&s;s, and where it plays over light and elegant portico<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and colonnades, it, unque&s;tionably, adorns the &s;cene; but among the giants of the fore&s;t, and near a heavy gothic man&s;ion&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="029378_0009_0FE07D37153A5B50">
"Well, my good &s;ir," &s;aid M. Que&s;nel, "I will not di&s;pute with you. You mu&s;t return to Paris before our ideas can at all agree. But <HI>&agrave;-propos</HI> of Venice; I have &s;ome thoughts of going thither, next &s;ummer; events may call me to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that &s;ame villa, too, which they tell me is the mo&s;t charming that can be imagined. In that ca&s;e I &s;hall leave the improvements I mention to another year, and I may, perhaps, be tempted to &s;tay &s;ome time in Italy."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him talk of being tempted to remain abroad, after he had mentioned his pre&s;ence to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at Paris, that it was with difficulty he could &s;teal away for a month or two; but St. Aubert under&s;tood the &s;elf-importance of the man too well to wonder at this trait; and the po&s;&s;ibility, that the&s;e projected improvements might be deferred, gave him a hope, that they might never take place.</P>
<P>Before they &s;eparated for the night, M. Que&s;nel de&s;ired to &s;peak with St. Aubert alone, and they retired to another room, where they remained a con&s;iderable time. The &s;ubject of this conver&s;ation was not known; but whatever it might be, St. Aubert, when he returned to the &s;upper room &s;eemed much di&s;turbed, and a &s;hade of &s;orrow &s;ometimes fell upon his features that alarmed Madame St. Aubert. When they were alone &s;he was tempted to inquire the occa&s;ion of it, but the delicacy of mind, which had ever appeared in his conduct, re&s;trained her: &s;he con&s;idered that, if St. Aubert wi&s;hed her to be acquainted with the &s;ubject of his concern, he would not wait for her inquiries.</P>
<P>On the following day, before M. Que&s;nel departed, he had a &s;econd conference with St. Aubert.</P>
<P>The gue&s;ts, after dining at the chateau, &s;et out in the cool of the day for Epourville, whither they gave him and Madame St. Aubert a pre&s;&s;ing invitation, prompted rather by the vanity of di&s;playing their &s;plendour, than by a wi&s;h to make their friends happy.</P>
<P>Emily returned, with delight, to the liberty which their pre|&s;ence had re&s;trained, to her books, her walks, and the rational conver&s;ation of M. and Madame St. Aubert, who &s;eemed to re|joice, no le&s;s, that they were delivered from the &s;hackles, which arrogance and frivolity had impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Madame St. Aubert excu&s;ed her&s;elf from &s;haring their u&s;ual evening walk, complaining that &s;he was not quite well, and St. Aubert and Emily went out together.</P>
<P>They cho&s;e a walk towards the mountains, intending to vi&s;it &s;ome old pen&s;ioners of St. Aubert, which, from his very moderate
<PB N="18" REF="029378_0010_0FE07D3BAFD3D9C8">
income, he contrived to &s;upport, though it is probable M. Que&s;|nel, with his very large one, could not have afforded this.</P>
<P>After di&s;tributing to his pen&s;ioners their weekly &s;tipends, li&s;tening patiently to the complaints of &s;ome, redre&s;&s;ing the grievances of others, and &s;oftening the di&s;contents of all, by the look of &s;ympathy and the &s;mile of benevolence, St. Aubert re|turned home through the woods,
<Q><L>&mdash;"where</L>
<L>At fall of eve the fairy-people throng,</L>
<L>In various games and revelry to pa&s;s</L>
<L>The &s;ummer night, as village &s;tories tell."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THOMPSON.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>"The evening gloom of woods was always delightful to me," &s;aid St. Aubert, who&s;e mind now experienced the &s;weet calm, which re&s;ults from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done a beneficent action, and which di&s;po&s;es it to receive plea&s;ure from every &s;ur|rounding object. "I remember that in my youth this gloom u&s;ed to call forth to my fancy a thou&s;and fairy vi&s;ions, and ro|mantic images; and, I own, I am not yet wholly in&s;en&s;ible of that high enthu&s;ia&s;m, which wakes the poet's dream. I can lin|ger, with &s;olemn &s;teps, under the deep &s;hades, &s;end forward a transforming eye into the di&s;tant ob&s;curity, and li&s;ten with thrilling delight to the my&s;tic murmuring of the woods."</P>
<P>"O my dear father," &s;aid Emily, while a &s;udden tear &s;tarted to her eye, "how exactly you de&s;cribe what I have felt &s;o often, and which I thought nobody had ever felt but my&s;elf! But hark! here comes the &s;weeping &s;ound over the wood-tops; now it dies away; how &s;olemn the &s;tillne&s;s that &s;ucceed! Now the breeze &s;wells again. It is like the voice of &s;ome &s;upernatural being&mdash;the voice of the &s;pirit of the woods, that watches over them by night. Ah! what light is yonder? But it is gone. And now it gleams again, near the root of that large che&s;nut: look, &s;ir!"</P>
<P>"Are you &s;uch an admirer of nature," &s;aid St. Aubert, "and &s;o little acquainted with her appearances as not to know that for the glow-worm? But come," added he gaily, "&s;tep a little further, and we &s;hall &s;ee fairies, perhaps; they are often compan|ions. The glow-worm lends his light, and they in return charm him with mu&s;ic, and the dance. Do you &s;ee nothing tripping yonder?"</P>
<P>Emily laughed. "Well my dear &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;ince you allow of this alliance, I may venture to own I have anticipated
<PB N="19" REF="029378_0010_0FE07D3BAFD3D9C8">
you; and almo&s;t dare venture to repeat &s;ome ver&s;es I made evening in the&s;e very woods."</P>
<P>"Nay," replied St. Aubert, "di&s;mi&s;s the <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> and ven|ture quite; let us hear what vagaries fancy has been playing in your mind. If &s;he has given you one of her &s;pells, you need not envy tho&s;e of the fairies."</P>
<P>"If it is &s;trong enough to enchant your judgment, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, "while I di&s;clo&s;e her images, I need <HI>not</HI> envy them. The lines go in a &s;ort of tripping mea&s;ure, which I thought might &s;uit the &s;ubject well enough, but I fear they are too irre|gular.</P>

<P>Whatever St. Aubert might think of the &s;tanzas, he would not deny his daughter the plea&s;ure of believing that he approved them; and, having given his commendation, he &s;unk into a reverie, and they walked on in &s;ilence.</P>

<P>St. Aubert continued &s;ilent till he reached the chateau, where his wife had retired to her chamber. The languor and dejec|tion, that had lately oppre&s;&s;ed her, and which the exertion called forth by the arrival of her gue&s;ts had &s;u&s;pended, now returned with increa&s;ed effect. On the following day, &s;ymptoms of fever appeared, and St. Aubert, having &s;ent for medical advice, learned that her di&s;order was a fever of the &s;ame nature as that, from which he had lately recovered. She had, indeed, taken the infection, during her attendance upon him, and, her con&s;ti|tution being too weak to throw out the di&s;ea&s;e immediately, it had lurked in her veins and occa&s;ioned the heavy languor of which &s;he had complained. St. Aubert, who&s;e anxiety for his wife overcame every other con&s;ideration, detained the phy&s;ician in his hou&s;e. He remembered the feelings and the reflections that had called a momentary gloom upon his mind, on the day when he had la&s;t vi&s;ited the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e in company with Ma|dame St. Aubert, and he now admitted a pre&s;entiment that this illne&s;s would be a fatal one. But he effectually concealed this from her and from his daughter, whom he endeavoured to re|animate
<PB N="21" REF="029378_0011_0FE07D45C09D93D8">
with hopes that her con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduities would not be unavailing. The phy&s;ician, when a&s;ked by St. Aubert for his opinion of the di&s;order, replied, that the event of it depended upon circum&s;tances which he could not a&s;certain. Madame St. Aubert &s;eemed to have formed a more decided one; but her eyes only gave hints of this. She frequently fixed them upon her anxious friends with an expre&s;&s;ion of pity, and of tenderne&s;s, as if &s;he anticipated the &s;orrow that awaited them, and that &s;eemed to &s;ay, it was for their &s;akes only, for their &s;ufferings, that &s;he regretted life. On the &s;eventh day, the di&s;order was at its cri&s;is. The Phy&s;ician a&s;&s;umed a graver manner, which &s;he ob&s;erved, and took occa&s;ion, when her family had once quitted the chamber, to tell him, that &s;he perceived her death was ap|proaching. "Do not attempt to deceive me," &s;aid &s;he, "I feel that I cannot long &s;urvive. I am prepared for the event, I have long, I hope, been preparing for it. Since I have not long to live, do not &s;uffer a mi&s;taken compa&s;&s;ion to induce you to flatter my family with fal&s;e hopes. If you do their affliction will only be the heavier when it arrives: I will endeavour to teach them re&s;ignation by my example."</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician was affected; he promi&s;ed to obey her, and told St. Aubert, &s;omewhat abruptly, that there was nothing to expect. The latter was not philo&s;opher enough to re&s;train his feelings when he received this information; but a con&s;ideration of the increa&s;ed affliction which the ob&s;ervance of his grief would occa&s;ion his wife, enabled him, after &s;ome time, to command him&s;elf in her pre&s;ence. Emily was at fir&s;t overwhelmed with the intelligence; then, deluded by the &s;trength of her wi&s;hes, a hope &s;prung up in her mind that her mother would yet reco|ver, and to this &s;he pertinaciou&s;ly adhered almo&s;t to the la&s;t hour.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of this di&s;order was marked on the &s;ide of Ma|dame St. Aubert, by patient &s;uffering, and &s;ubjected wi&s;hes. The compo&s;ure, with which &s;he awaited her death, could be de|rived only from the retro&s;pect of a life governed, as far as hu|man fraility permits, by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being always in the pre&s;ence of the Deity, and by the hope of an higher world. But her piety could not entirely &s;ubdue the grief of parting from tho&s;e whom &s;he &s;o dearly loved. During the&s;e her la&s;t hours, &s;he conver&s;ed much with St. Aubert and Emily, on the pro&s;pect of futurity, and on other religious topics. The re&s;ig|nation &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, with the firm hope of meeting in a future world the friends &s;he left in this, and the effort which &s;ometimes appeared to conceal her &s;orrow at this temporary &s;eparation, frequently affected St. Aubert &s;o much as to oblige him to leave
<PB N="22" REF="029378_0012_0FE07D4B96FF5C10">
the room. Having indulged his tears awhile, he would dry them and return to his chamber with a countenance compo&s;ed by an endeavour which did but increa&s;e his grief.</P>
<P>Never had Emily felt the importance of the le&s;&s;ons, which had taught her to re&s;train her &s;en&s;ibility, &s;o much as in the&s;e moments, and never had &s;he practi&s;ed them with a triumph &s;o complete. But when the la&s;t was over, &s;he &s;unk at once un|der the pre&s;&s;ure of her &s;orrow, and then perceived that it was hope, as well as fortitude, which had hitherto &s;upported her. St. Aubert was for a time too devoid of comfort him&s;elf to be&s;tow any on his daughter.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MADAME St. Aubert was interred in the neighbouring village church; her hu&s;band and daughter attended her to the grave, followed by a long train of the pea&s;antry, who were &s;incere mourners of this excellent woman.</P>
<P>On his return from the funeral, St. Aubert &s;hut him&s;elf in his chamber. When he came forth, it was with a &s;erene counte|nance though pale in &s;orrow. He gave orders that his family &s;hould attend him. Emily only was ab&s;ent; who, overcome with the &s;cene &s;he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed, had retired to her clo&s;et to weep alone. St. Aubert followed her thither: he took her hand in &s;ilence, while &s;he continued to weep; and it was &s;ome moments before he could &s;o far command his voice as to &s;peak. It trembled while he &s;aid, "My Emily, I am going to prayers with my family; you will join us. We mu&s;t a&s;k &s;upport from above. Where el&s;e ought we to &s;eek it, where el&s;e can we find it?"</P>
<P>Emily checked her tears, and followed her father to the par|lour, where the &s;ervants being a&s;&s;embled, St. Aubert read, in a low and &s;olemn voice, the evening &s;ervice, and added a prayer for the &s;oul of the departed. During this, his voice often faltered, his tears fell upon the book, and at length he pau&s;ed. But the &s;ublime emotions of pure devotion gradually elevated his views above this world, and finally brought comfort to his heart.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervice was ended, and the &s;ervants were withdrawn, he tenderly ki&s;&s;ed Emily, and &s;aid, "I have endeavoured to
<PB N="23" REF="029378_0012_0FE07D4B96FF5C10">
teach you, from your earlie&s;t youth, the duty of &s;elf-command; I have pointed out to you, the great importance of it through life, not only as it pre&s;erves us in the various and dangerous temptations that call us from rectitude and virtue, but as it limits the indulgences which are termed virtuous, yet which, extended beyond a certain boundary, are vicious, for their con&s;equence is evil. All exce&s;s is vicious; even that &s;orrow, which is amiable in its origin, be|comes a &s;elfi&s;h and unju&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, if indulged at the expen&s;e of our duties&mdash;by our duties, I mean what we owe to our&s;elves, as well as to others. The indulgence of exce&s;&s;ive grief enervates the mind, and almo&s;t incapacitates it for again partaking of tho&s;e various innocent enjoyments which a benevolent God de&s;igned to be the &s;un-&s;hine of our lives. My dear Emily recollect and practi&s;e the precepts I have &s;o often given you, and which your own experience has &s;o often &s;hewn you to be wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Your &s;orrow is u&s;ele&s;s. Do not receive this as merely a com|mon-place remark, but let rea&s;on <HI>therefore</HI> re&s;train &s;orrow. I would not annihilate your feelings my child, I would only teach you to command them; for whatever may be the evils re&s;ulting from a too &s;u&s;ceptible heart, nothing can be hoped from an in|&s;en&s;ible one; that, on the other hand, is all vice&mdash;vice, of which the deformity is not &s;oftened, or the effect con&s;oled, for, by any &s;emblance or po&s;&s;ibility of good. You know my &s;ufferings, and are therefore, convinced that mine are not the light words which, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, are &s;o often repeated to de&s;troy even the &s;our|ces of hone&s;t emotion, on which merely di&s;play the &s;elfi&s;h o&s;ten|tation of a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy. I will &s;hew my Emily, that I can practi&s;e what I advi&s;e. I have &s;aid thus much becau&s;e I cannot bear to &s;ee you wa&s;ting in u&s;ele&s;s &s;orrow, for want of that re&s;i&s;t|ance which is due from mind; and I have not &s;aid it till now, becau&s;e there is a period when all rea&s;oning mu&s;t yield to nature; that is pa&s;t: and another, when exce&s;&s;ive indulgence, having &s;unk into habit, weighs down the ela&s;ticity of the &s;pirits &s;o as to render conque&s;t nearly impo&s;&s;ible; this is to come. You, my Emily, will &s;hew that you are willing to avoid it."</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled through her tears upon her father: "Dear Sir," &s;aid &s;he, and her voice trembled; &s;he would have added, "I will &s;hew my&s;elf worthy of being your daughter; but a mingled emotion of gratitude, affection and grief overcame her. St. Aubert &s;uffered her to weep without interruption, and then began to talk on common topics.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on who came to condole with St. Aubert was an
<PB N="24" REF="029378_0013_0FE07D57B655A718">
M. Barreaux, an au&s;tere and &s;eemingly unfeeling man. A ta&s;te for botany had introduced them to each other, for they had fre|quently met in their wanderings among the mountains. M. Barreaux had retired from the world, and almo&s;t from &s;ociety, to live in a plea&s;ant chateau, on the &s;kirts of the woods, near La Vallee. He al&s;o had been di&s;appointed in his opinion of man|kind; but he did not, like St. Aubert, pity and mourn for them; he felt more indignation at their vices, than compa&s;&s;ion for their weakne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him; for, though he had often pre&s;&s;ed him to come to the chateau, he had never till now accepted the invitation; and now he came without ceremo|ny or re&s;erve, entering the parlour as an old friend. The claims of misfortune appeared to have &s;oftened down all the ruggedne&s;s and prejudices of his heart. St. Aubert unhappy, &s;eemed to be the &s;ole idea that occupied his mind. It was in manners, more than in words, that he appeared to &s;ympathize with his friends: he &s;poke little on the &s;ubject of their grief; but the minute at|tention he gave them, and the modulated voice, and &s;oftened look that accompanied it, came from his heart, and &s;poke to theirs.</P>
<P>At this melancholy period. St. Aubert was likewi&s;e vi&s;ited by Madame Cheron, his only &s;urviving &s;i&s;ter, who had been &s;ome years a widow, and now re&s;ided on her own e&s;tate near Tho|lou&s;e. The intercour&s;e between them had not been very fre|quent. In her condolements, words were not wanting; &s;he un|der&s;tood not the magic of the look that &s;peaks at once to the &s;oul, or the voice that &s;inks like balm to the heart: but &s;he a&s;|&s;ured St. Aubert that &s;he &s;incerely &s;ympathized with him, prai&s;|ed the virtues of his late wife, and then offered what &s;he con|&s;idered to be con&s;olation. Emily wept uncea&s;ingly while &s;he &s;poke; St. Aubert was tranquil, li&s;tened to what &s;he &s;aid in &s;ilence, and then turned the di&s;cour&s;e upon another &s;ubject.</P>
<P>At parting &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him and her niece to make her an ear|ly vi&s;it. "Change of place will amu&s;e you," &s;aid &s;he, "and it is wrong to give way to grief." St. Aubert acknowledged the truth of the&s;e words of cour&s;e; but, at the &s;ame time, felt more reluctant than ever to quit the &s;pot which his pa&s;t happine&s;s had con&s;ecrated. The pre&s;ence of his wife had &s;anctified every &s;ur|rounding &s;cene, and each day, as it gradually &s;oftened the acute|ne&s;s of his &s;uffering, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the tender enchantment that bound him to home.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="029378_0013_0FE07D57B655A718">
But there were calls which mu&s;t be complied with, and of this kind was the vi&s;it he paid to his brother in-law M. Que&s;|nel. An affair of an intere&s;ting nature made it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould delay this vi&s;it no longer, and, wi&s;hing to rou&s;e Emily from her dejection, he took her with him to Epourville.</P>
<P>As the carriage entered upon the fore&s;t that adjoined his pater|nal domain, his eyes once more caught between the che&s;nut avenue, the turreted corners of the chateau. He &s;ighed to think of what had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince he was la&s;t there, and that it was now the property of a man who neither revered nor valued it. At length he entered the avenue, who&s;e lofty trees had &s;o often de|lighted him when a boy, and who&s;e melancholy &s;hade was now &s;o congenial with the tone of his &s;pirits. Every feature of the edifice, di&s;tingui&s;hed by an air of heavy grandeur, appeared &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively between the branches of the trees&mdash;the broad turret, the arched gate-way that led into the courts, the draw bridge, and the dry fo&s;&s;e which &s;urrounded the whole.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of carriage wheels brought a troop of &s;ervants to the great gate, where St. Aubert alighted, and from which he led Emily into the gothic hall, now no longer hung with the arms and ancient banners of the family. The&s;e were di&s;placed, and the oak wain&s;cotting, and beams that cro&s;&s;ed the roof, were painted white. The large table, too, that u&s;ed to &s;tretch along the upper end of the hall, where the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion loved to di&s;play his ho&s;pitality, and whence the peal of laughter, and the &s;ong of conviviality, had &s;o often re&s;ounded, was now re|moved; even the benches that had &s;urrounded the hall were no longer there. The heavy walls were hung with frivolous orna|ments, and every thing that appeared, denoted the fal&s;e ta&s;te and corrupted &s;entiments of the pre&s;ent owner.</P>
<P>St. Aubert followed a gay Pari&s;ian &s;ervant to a parlour, where &s;at Mon&s;. and Madame Que&s;nel, who received him with a &s;tately politene&s;s, and, after a few formal words of condolement, &s;eemed to have forgotten that they ever had a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Emily felt tears &s;well into her eyes, and then re&s;entment checked them. St. Aubert, calm and deliberate, pre&s;erved his dignity without a&s;&s;uming importance, and Que&s;nel was depre&s;&s;ed by his pre&s;ence without exactly knowing wherefore.</P>
<P>After &s;ome general conver&s;ation, St. Aubert reque&s;ted to &s;peak with him alone; and Emily, being left with Madame Que&s;nel, &s;oon learned that a large party was invited to dine at the chateau, and was compelled to hear that nothing which was pa&s;t and irremediable ought to prevent the fe&s;tivity of the pre|&s;ent hour.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="029378_0014_0FE07D5D6B3E9268">
St. Aubert, when he was told that company were expected, felt a mixed emotion of di&s;gu&s;t and indignation again&s;t the in|&s;en&s;ibility of Que&s;nel, which prompted him to return home im|mediately. But he was informed, that Madame Cheron had been a&s;ked to meet him; and, when he looked at Emily, and con&s;idered that a time might come when the enmity of her uncle would be prejudicial to her, he determined not to incur it him|&s;elf, by conduct which would be re&s;ented as indecorous, by the very per&s;ons who now &s;hewed &s;o little &s;en&s;e of decorum.</P>
<P>Among the vi&s;itors a&s;&s;embled at dinner were two Italian gen|tlemen, of whom one was named Montoni, a di&s;tant relation of Madame Que&s;nel, a man about forty, of an uncommonly hand|&s;ome per&s;on, with features manly and expre&s;&s;ive, but who&s;e countenance exhibited, upon the whole, more of the haughtine&s;s of command, and the quickne&s;s of di&s;cernment, than of any other character.</P>
<P>Signor Cavigni, his friend, appeared to be about thirty&mdash;his inferior in dignity, but equal to him in penetration of counte|nance, and &s;uperior in in&s;inuation of manner.</P>
<P>Emily was &s;hocked by the &s;alutation with which Madame Cheron met her father&mdash;"Dear brother," &s;aid &s;he, "I am con|cerned to &s;ee you look &s;o very ill; do, pray, have advice!" St. Aubert an&s;wered with a melancholy &s;mile, that he felt him&s;elf much as u&s;ual; but Emily's fears made her now fancy that her father looked wor&s;e than he really did.</P>
<P>Emily would have been amu&s;ed by the new characters &s;he &s;aw, and the varied conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed during dinner, which was &s;erved in a &s;tile of &s;plendour &s;he had &s;eldom &s;een before, had her &s;pirits been le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed. Of the gue&s;ts, Signor Mon|toni was lately come from Italy, and he &s;poke of the commo|tions which at that period agitated the country; talked of party differences with warmth, and then lamented the probable con&s;e|quences of the tumults. His friend &s;poke with equal ardour, of the politics of his country; prai&s;ed the government and pro&s;perity of Venice, and boa&s;ted of its decided &s;uperiority over all the other Italian &s;tates. He then turned to the ladies, and talked with the &s;ame eloquence, of Pari&s;ian fa&s;hions, the French opera, and French manners; and on the latter &s;ubject he did not fail to mingle what is &s;o particularly agreeable to French ta&s;te. The flattery was not detected by tho&s;e to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, though its effect in producing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive attention, did not e&s;cape, his ob&s;ervation. When he could di&s;engage him&s;elf from the a&s;&s;iduities of the other ladies, he &s;ometimes addre&s;&s;ed Emily:
<PB N="27" REF="029378_0014_0FE07D5D6B3E9268">
but &s;he knew nothing of Pari&s;ian fa&s;hions, or Pari&s;ian operas; and her mode&s;ty, &s;implicity and correct manners formed a deci|ded contra&s;t to tho&s;e of her female companions.</P>
<P>After dinner, St. Aubert &s;tole from the room to view once more the old che&s;nut which Que&s;nel talked of cutting down.&mdash;As he &s;tood under its &s;hade, and looked up among its branches, &s;till luxuriant, and &s;aw here and there the blue &s;ky trembling between them; the pur&s;uits and events of his early days crowded fa&s;t to his mind, with the figures and characters of friends, long &s;ince gone from the earth; and he now felt him&s;elf to be al|mo&s;t an in&s;ulated being, with nobody but his Emily for his heart to turn to.</P>
<P>He &s;tood lo&s;t amid the &s;cenes of years which fancy called up, till the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion clo&s;ed with the picture of his dying wife, and he &s;tarted away, to forget it, if po&s;&s;ible, at the &s;ocial board.</P>
<P>St. Aubert ordered his carriage at an early hour, and Emily ob&s;erved, that he was more than u&s;ually &s;ilent and dejected on the way home; but &s;he con&s;idered this to be the effect of his vi&s;it to a place which &s;poke &s;o eloquently of former times, nor &s;u&s;|pected that he had a cau&s;e of grief which he concealed from her.</P>
<P>On entering the chateau &s;he felt more depre&s;&s;ed than ever, for &s;he more than ever mi&s;&s;ed the pre&s;ence of that dear parent, who, whenever &s;he had been from home, u&s;ed to welcome her return with &s;miles and fondne&s;s; now, all was &s;ilent and for&s;aken.</P>
<P>But what rea&s;on and effort may fail to do, time effects. Week after week pa&s;&s;ed away, and each, as it pa&s;&s;ed, &s;tole &s;omething from the har&s;hne&s;s of her affliction, till it was mellowed to that tenderne&s;s which the feeling heart cheri&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;acred. St. Au|bert, on the contrary, vi&s;ibly declined in health; though Emily, who had been &s;o con&s;tantly with him, was almo&s;t the la&s;t per&s;on who ob&s;erved it. His con&s;titution had never recovered from the late attack of the fever, and the &s;ucceeding &s;hock it had received from Madame St. Aubert's death had produced its pre&s;ent infir|mity. His phy&s;ician now ordered him to travel; for it was perceptible that &s;orrow had &s;eized upon his nerve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> weakened as they had been by the preceding illne&s;s; and variety of &s;cene, it was probable, would, by amu&s;ing his mind, re&s;tore them to their proper tone.</P>
<P>For &s;ome days Emily was occupied in preparations to attend him; and he, by endeavours to dimini&s;h his expences at home during the journey&mdash;a purpo&s;e which determined him at length to di&s;mi&s;s his dome&s;tics. Emily &s;eldom oppo&s;ed her father's wi&s;hes by que&s;tions or remon&s;trances, or &s;he would now have
<PB N="28" REF="029378_0015_0FE07D6CC9BA66F8">
a&s;ked why he did not take a &s;ervant, and have repre&s;ented that his infirm health made one almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. But when, on the eve of their departure, &s;he found that he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Jacques, Francis, and Mary, and detained only There&s;a the old hou&s;e|keeper, &s;he was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed, and ventured to a&s;k his rea&s;on for having done &s;o. "To &s;ave expen&s;es, my dear," he replied&mdash;"we are going on an expen&s;ive excur&s;ion."</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician had pre&s;cribed the air of Languedoc and Pro|vence; and St. Aubert determined, therefore, to travel lei&s;urely along the &s;hores of the Mediterranean, towards Provence.</P>
<P>They retired early to their chamber on the night before their departure; but Emily had a few books and other things to col|lect, and the clock had &s;truck twelve before &s;he had fini&s;hed, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> had remembered that &s;ome of her drawing in&s;truments, which &s;he meant to take with her, were in the parlour below. As &s;he went to fetch the&s;e, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her father's room, and, perceiving the door half open, concluded that he was in his &s;tudy&mdash;for, &s;ince the death of Madame St. Aubert, it had been frequently his cu&s;tom to ri&s;e from his re&s;tle&s;s bed, and go thither to compo&s;e his mind. When &s;he was below &s;tairs &s;he looked into this room, but without finding him; and as &s;he returned to her cham|ber, &s;he tapped at his door, and receiving no an&s;wer, &s;tepped &s;oftly in, to be certain whether he was there.</P>
<P>The room was dark, but a light glimmered through &s;ome panes of gla&s;s that were placed in the upper part of a clo&s;et door. Emily believed her father to be in the clo&s;et, and, &s;ur|pri&s;ed that he was up at &s;o late an hour, apprehended he was unwell, and was going to inquire; but, con&s;idering that her &s;ud|den appearance at this hour might alarm him, &s;he removed her light to the &s;tairca&s;e, and then &s;tepped &s;oftly to the clo&s;et. On looking through the panes of gla&s;s, &s;he &s;aw him &s;eated at a &s;mall table, with papers before him, &s;ome of which he was reading with deep attention and intere&s;t, during which he often wept, and &s;obbed aloud. Emily, who had come to the door to learn whether her father was ill, was now detained there by a mixture of curio&s;ity and tenderne&s;s. She could not witne&s;s his &s;orrow, without being anxious to know the &s;ubject of it; and &s;he there|fore continued to ob&s;erve him in &s;ilence, concluding that tho&s;e papers were letters of her late mother. Pre&s;ently he knelt down and with a look &s;o &s;olemn as &s;he had &s;eldom &s;een him a&s;&s;ume, and which was mingled with a certain wild expre&s;&s;ion, that par|took more of horror than of any other character, he prayed &s;ilently for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="029378_0015_0FE07D6CC9BA66F8">
When he ro&s;e a gha&s;tly palene&s;s was on his countenance.&mdash;Emily was ha&s;tily retiring; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he &s;aw him turn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the papers, and &s;he &s;topped. He took from among them a &s;mall ca&s;e, and from thence a miniature picture. The rays of light fell &s;trongly upon it, and &s;he perceived it to be that of a lady, but not of her mother.</P>
<P>St. Aubert gazed earne&s;tly and tenderly upon this portrait, put it to his lips, and then to his heart, and &s;ighed with a convul&s;ive force. Emily could &s;carcely believe what &s;he &s;aw to be real. She never knew till now that he had a picture of any other lady than her mother, much le&s;s that he had one which he evidently valued &s;o highly; but having looked repeatedly, to be certain that it was not the re&s;emblance of Madame St. Aubert, &s;he became entirely convinced that it was de&s;igned for that of &s;ome other per&s;on.</P>
<P>At length St. Aubert returned the picture into its ca&s;e; and Emily recollecting, that &s;he was intruding upon his private &s;or|rows, &s;oftly withdrew from the chamber.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ST. Aubert, in&s;tead of taking the more direct road, that ran along the feet of the Pyrenees to Languedoc, cho&s;e one that, winding over the heights, afforded more exten&s;ive views and greater variety of romantic &s;cenery. He turned a little out of his way to take leave of M. Barreaux, whom he found botaniz|ing in the wood near his chateau, and who, when he was told the purpo&s;e of St. Aubert's vi&s;it, expre&s;&s;ed a degree of concern, &s;uch as his friend had thought it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for him to feel on any &s;imilar occa&s;ion. They parted with mutual regret:</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="029378_0016_0FE07D71A16FB140">
"If any thing could have tempted me from my retirement," &s;aid M. Barreaux, "it would have been the plea&s;ure of accompany|ing you on this little tour. I do not often offer compliments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you may, therefore believe me, when I &s;ay, that I &s;hall look for your return with impatience."</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded on their journey. As they a&s;cended the heights, St. Aubert often looked back upon his chateau, in the plain below; tender images crowded to his mind; his me|lancholy imagination &s;ugge&s;ted that he &s;hould return no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and though he checked this wandering thought, &s;till he continued to look, till the hazine&s;s of di&s;tance blended his home with the general land&s;cape, and St. Aubert &s;eemed to
<Q><L>"Drag at each remove a lengthening chain."</L></Q></P>
<P>He and Emily continued &s;unk in mu&s;ing &s;ilence for &s;ome leagues, from which melancholy reverie Emily fir&s;t awoke, and her young fancy, &s;truck with the grandeur of the objects around, gradually yielded to delightful impre&s;&s;ions. The road now de|&s;cended into glens, confined by &s;tupendous walls of rock, grey and barren, except where &s;hrubs fringed their &s;ummits, or patches of meagre vegitation tinted their rece&s;&s;es, in which the wild goat was frequently brow&s;ing. And now, the way led to the lofty cliffs, from whence the land&s;cape was &s;een extending in all its magnificence.</P>
<P>Emily could not re&s;train her tran&s;port as &s;he looked over the pine fore&s;ts of the mountains upon the va&s;t plains, that, enriched with woods, towns, Hu&s;hing vines, and plantations of almonds, palms and olives, &s;tretched along, till their various colours melted in di&s;tance into one harmonious hue, that &s;eemed to unite earth with heaven. Through the whole of this glorious &s;cene the maje&s;tic Garonne wandered; de&s;cending from its &s;ource among the Pyrenees, and winding its blue waves towards the Bay of Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>The ruggedne&s;s of the unfrequented road often obliged the wanderers to alight from their little carriage, but they thought them&s;elves amply repaid for this inconvenience by the grandeur of the &s;cenes; and, while the muleteer led his animals &s;lowly over the broken ground, the travellers had lei&s;ure to linger amid the&s;e &s;olitudes, and to indulge the &s;ublime reflections, which &s;often, while they elevate, the heart, and fill it with the certainty of a pre&s;ent God! Still the enjoyment of St. Aubert was touched with that pen&s;ive melancholy, which gives to every object a mellower tint, and breathes a &s;acred charm over all around.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="029378_0016_0FE07D71A16FB140">
They had provided again&s;t part of the evil to be encountered from a want of convenient inns, by carrying a &s;tock of provi|&s;ions in the carriage, &s;o that they might take refre&s;hment on any plea&s;ant &s;pot, in the open air, and pa&s;s the nights wherever they &s;hould happen to meet with a comfortable cottage. For the mind, al&s;o, they had provided, by a work on botany, written by M. Barreaux, and by &s;everal of the Latin and Italian poets; while Emily's pencil enabled her to pre&s;erve &s;ome of tho&s;e com|binations of forms, which charmed her at every &s;tep.</P>
<P>The loneline&s;s of the road, where, only now and then, a pea|&s;ant was &s;een driving his mule, or &s;ome mountaineer-children at play among the rocks, heightened the effect of the &s;cenery. St. Aubert was &s;o much &s;truck with it, that he determined if he could hear of a road, to penetrate further among the mountains, and, bending his way rather more to the &s;outh, to emerge into Rou&s;illon, and coa&s;t the Mediterranean along part of that country to Languedoc.</P>
<P>Soon after mid-day, they reached the &s;ummit of one of tho&s;e cliffs, which, bright with the verdure of palm trees, adorn, like gems, the tremendous walls of the rocks, and which overlooked the greater part of Ga&s;cony, and part of Languedoc. Here was &s;hade, and the fre&s;h water of a &s;pring, that gliding among the turf, under the trees, thence precipitated it&s;elf from rock to rock, till its da&s;hing murmurs were lo&s;t in the aby&s;s, though its white foam was long &s;een amid the darkne&s;s of the pines below.</P>
<P>This was a &s;pot well &s;uited for re&s;t, and the travellers alighted to dine, while the mules were unharne&s;&s;ed to brow&s;e on the &s;a|voury herbs that enrich this &s;ummit.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before St. Aubert or Emily could withdraw their attention from the &s;urrounding object, &s;o as to partake of their little repa&s;t. Seated in the &s;hade of the palms, St. Au|bert pointed out to her ob&s;ervation the cour&s;e of the rivers, the &s;ituation of great towns, and the boundaries of provinces, which &s;cience, rather than the eye, enabled him to de&s;cribe. Notwith|&s;tanding this occupation, when he had talked awhile he &s;udden|ly became &s;ilent, thoughtful, and tears often &s;welled to his eyes, which Emily ob&s;erved, and the &s;ympathy of her own heart told her their cau&s;e. The &s;cene before them bore &s;ome re&s;emblance, though it was on a much grander &s;cale, to a fovourite one of the late Madame St. Aubert, within view of the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e. They both ob&s;erved this, and thought how delighted &s;he would have been with the pre&s;ent land&s;cape, while they knew that her eyes mu&s;t never, never more open upon this world. St. Aubert
<PB N="32" REF="029378_0017_0FE07D7D77518790">
remembered the la&s;t time of his vi&s;iting that &s;pot in company with her, and al&s;o the mournfully pre&s;aging thoughts which had then ari&s;en in his mind, and were now, even thus &s;oon, realized! The recollections &s;ubdued him, and he abruptly ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and walked away to where no eye could ob&s;erve his grief.</P>
<P>When he returned, his countenance had recovered its u&s;ual &s;erenity; he took Emily's hand, pre&s;&s;ed it affectionately, with|out &s;peaking, and &s;oon after called to the muleteer, who &s;at at a little di&s;tance concerning a road among the mountains towards Rou&s;illon. Michael &s;aid, there were &s;everal that way; but he did not know how far they extended, or even whether they were pa&s;|&s;able; and St. Aubert who did not intend to travel after &s;un-&s;et, a&s;ked what village they could reach about that time. The mu|leteer calculated, that they could ea&s;ily reach Mateau, which was in their pre&s;ent road; but that, if they took a road that &s;loped more to the &s;outh, towards Rou&s;illon, there was a hamlet, which he thought they could gain before the evening &s;hut in.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, after &s;ome he&s;itation determined to take the latter cour&s;e, and Michael, having fini&s;hed his meal, and harne&s;&s;ed his mules, again &s;et forward, but &s;oon &s;topped; and St. Aubert &s;aw him doing homage to a cro&s;s, that &s;tood on a rock impending over their way. Having concluded his devotions, he &s;macked his whip in the air, and, in &s;pite of the rough road, and the pain of his poor mules, which he had been lately lamenting, rattled, in a full gallop, along the edge of a precipice, which it made the eye dizzy to look down. Emily was terrified almo&s;t to fainting; and St. Aubert, apprehending &s;till greater danger from &s;uddenly &s;topping the driver, was compelled to &s;it quietly and tru&s;t his fate to the &s;trength and di&s;cretion of the mules, who &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater portion of the latter quality than their ma&s;ter; for they carried the travellers &s;afely into the val|ley, and there &s;topped upon the brink of the rivulet that water|ed it.</P>
<P>Leaving the &s;plendour of exten&s;ive pro&s;pects, they now enter|ed this narrow valley &s;creened by
<Q><L>Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic &s;pell,</L>
<L>Here &s;corch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green,</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;cene of barrenne&s;s was here and there interrupted by the &s;preading branches of the larch and cedar, which threw their gloom over the cliff, or athwart the torrent that rolled in the vale. No living creature appeared, except the izard, &s;cram|bling among the rocks, and often hanging upon points &s;o dange|rous, that fancy &s;hrunk from the view of them. This was &s;uch
<PB N="33" REF="029378_0017_0FE07D7D77518790">
a &s;cene as <HI>Salvator</HI> would have cho&s;en, had he then exi&s;ted, for his canva&s;s; St. Aubert, impre&s;&s;ed by the romantic character of the place, almo&s;t expected to &s;ee banditti &s;tart from behind &s;ome projecting rock, and he kept his hand upon the arms with which he always travelled.</P>
<P>As they advanced, the valley opened; its &s;avage features gra|dually &s;oftened, and, towards evening, they were among heathy mountains, &s;tretched in far per&s;pective, along which the &s;olitary &s;heep-bell was heard, and the voice of the &s;hepherd calling his wandering flocks to the nightly fold. His cabin, partly &s;hadowed by the cork-tree and the ilex, which St. Aubert ob|&s;erved to flouri&s;h in higher reigons of the air than any other trees, except the fur, was all the human habitation that yet ap|peared. Along the bottom of this valley the mo&s;t vivid ver|dure was &s;pread; and, in the little hollow rece&s;&s;es of the moun|tains, under the &s;hade of the oak and che&s;nut, herds of cattle were grazing. Groups of them, too, were often &s;een repo&s;ing on the banks of the rivulet, or laving their &s;ides in the cool &s;tream, and &s;ipping its wave.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now &s;itting upon the valley; its la&s;t light gleamed upon the water, and heightened the rich yellow and purple tints of the heath and broom, that over&s;pread the mountains. St. Aubert inquired of Michael the di&s;tance to the hamlet he had mention|ed, but the man could not with certainty tell; and Emily began to fear that he had mi&s;taken the road. Here was no human be|ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t, or direct them; they had left the &s;hepherd and his cabbin far behind, and the &s;cene became &s;o ob&s;cured in twilight, that the eye could not follow the di&s;tant per&s;pective of the val|ley in &s;earch of a cottage, or a hamlet. A glow of the horizon &s;till marked the we&s;t, and this was of &s;ome little u&s;e to the tra|vellers. Michael &s;eemed endeavouring to keep up his courage by &s;inging; his mu&s;ic, however, was not of a kind to di&s;per&s;e melancholy; he &s;ung, in a &s;ort of chant, one of the mo&s;t di&s;mal ditties his pre&s;ent auditors had ever heard, and St. Aubert at length di&s;covered it to be a ve&s;-per-hymn to his favourite &s;aint.</P>
<P>They travelled on, &s;unk in that thoughtful melancholy, with which twilight and &s;olitude impre&s;s the mind. Michael had now ended his ditty, and nothing was heard but the drow&s;y mur|mur of the breeze among the woods, and its light flutter, as it blow fre&s;hly into the carriage. They were at length rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of fire arms. St. Aubert called to the muleteer to &s;top, and they li&s;tened. The noi&s;e was not repeated; but pre|&s;ently they heard a ru&s;tling among the brakes. St. Aubert drew
<PB N="34" REF="029378_0018_0FE07D83512501F0">
forth a pi&s;tol, and ordered Michael to proceed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; who had not long obeyed, before a horn &s;ounded, that made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mountains ring. He looked again from the window, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aw a young man &s;pring from the bu&s;hes into the road, followed by a couple of dogs. The &s;tranger was in a hunter's dre&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gun was &s;lung acro&s;s his &s;houlders, the hunter's horn hung from his belt, and in his hand was a &s;mall pike, which, as he held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> added to the manly grace of his figure, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the agility of his &s;teps.</P>
<P>After a moment's he&s;itation, St. Aubert again &s;topped the carriage, and waited till he came up, that they might inquire concerning the hamlet they were in &s;earch of. The &s;tranger in|formed him, that it was only half a league di&s;tant, that he was going thither him&s;elf, and would readily &s;hew the way. St. Au|bert thanked him for the offer, and, plea&s;ed with his chevalier like air and open countenance, a&s;ked him to take a &s;eat in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> carriage; which the &s;tranger, with an acknowledgment, declin|ed, adding that he would keep pace with the mules. "But I fear you will be wretchedly accommodated," &s;aid he: "the in|habitants of the&s;e mountains are a &s;imple people, who are not only without the luxuries of life, but almo&s;t de&s;titute of what in other places are held to be its nece&s;&s;aries."</P>
<P>"I perceive you are not one of its inhabitants, &s;ir," &s;aid St. Aubert.</P>
<P>"No, &s;ir, I am only a wanderer here."</P>
<P>The carriage drove on, and the increa&s;ing du&s;k made the tra|vellers very thankful that they had a guide; the frequent glens, too, that now opened among the mountains, would likewi&s;e have added to their perplexity. Emily, as &s;he looked up one of the&s;e, &s;aw &s;omething at a great di&s;tance like a bright cloud in the air. "What light is yonder, &s;ir?" &s;aid &s;he. St. Aubert looked, and perceived that it was the &s;nowy &s;ummit of a mountain, &s;o much higher than any round it, that it &s;till reflected the &s;un's ray's, while tho&s;e below lay in deep &s;hade.</P>
<P>At length, village lights were &s;een to twinkle through the du&s;k, and, &s;oon after, &s;ome cottages were di&s;covered in the val|ley, or rather were &s;een by reflection in the &s;tream, on who&s;e margin they &s;tood, and which &s;till gleamed with the evening light.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger now came up, and St. Aubert, on further in|quiry, found not only that there was no inn in the place, but not any &s;ort of hou&s;e of public reception. The &s;tranger, how|ever, offered to walk on, and inquire for a cottage to accommo|date them; for which further civility St. Aubert returned his
<PB N="35" REF="029378_0018_0FE07D83512501F0">
thanks, and &s;aid, that, as the village was &s;o near, he would alight, and walk with him. Emily followed &s;lowly in the carriage.</P>
<P>On the way, St. Aubert a&s;ked his companion what &s;ucce&s;s he had had in the cha&s;e. "Not much &s;ir," he replied, "nor do I aim at it. I am plea&s;ed with the country, and mean to &s;aunter away a few weeks among its &s;cenes. My dogs I take with me more for companion&s;hip than for game. This dre&s;s, too, gives me an o&s;ten&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s, and procures me that re&s;pect from the people, which would, perhaps, be refu&s;ed to a lonely &s;tranger who had no vi&s;ible motive for coming among them."</P>
<P>"I admire your ta&s;te," &s;aid St. Aubert, "and, if I was a younger man, &s;hould like to pa&s;s a few weeks in your way ex|ceedingly. I, too, am a wanderer, but neither my plan nor pur|&s;uits are axactly like yours&mdash;I go in &s;earch of health, as much as of amu&s;ement." St Aubert &s;ighed, and pau&s;ed; and then, &s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, he re&s;umed: If I can hear of a tolerable road, that &s;hall afford decent accommodation, it is my intention to pa&s;s into Rou&s;illon, and along the &s;ea-&s;hore to Languedoc. You, &s;ir, &s;eem to be acquainted with the country, and can per|haps, give me information on the &s;ubject."</P>
<P>The &s;tranger &s;aid that what information he could give was en|tirely at his &s;ervice; and then mentioned a road rather more to the ea&s;t, which led to a town, whence it would be ea&s;y to proceed into Rou&s;illon.</P>
<P>They now arrived at the village, and commenced their &s;earch for a cottage, that would afford a night's lodging. In &s;everal, which they entered, ignorance, poverty, and mirth &s;eemed equal|ly to prevail; and the owners eyed St. Aubert with a mixture of curio&s;ity and timidity. Nothing like a bed could be found, and he had cea&s;ed to inquire for one, when Emily joined him, who ob&s;erved the languor of her father's countenance, and la|mented, that he had taken a road &s;o ill provided with the com|forts nece&s;&s;ary for an invalid. Other cottages, which they ex|amined, &s;eemed &s;omewhat le&s;s &s;avage than the former, con&s;i&s;ting of two rooms, if &s;uch they could be called; the fir&s;t of the&s;e occu|pied by mules and pigs, the &s;econd by the family, which gene|rally con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix or eight children, with their parents, who &s;lept on beds of &s;kins and dried beach leaves, &s;pread upon a mud floor. Here light was admitted, and &s;moke di&s;charged, through an aperture in the roof; and here the &s;cent of &s;pirits (for the travelling &s;mugglers, who haunted the Pyrenees, had made this rude people familiar with the u&s;e of liquors) was generally per|ceptible enough. Emily turned from &s;uch &s;cenes, and looked at
<PB N="36" REF="029378_0019_0FE07D93EBFD4AA0">
her father with anxious tenderne&s;s, which the young &s;tranger &s;eemed to ob&s;erve; for, drawing St. Aubert a&s;ide, he made him an offer of his own bed. "It is a decent one," &s;aid he, "when compared with what we have ju&s;t &s;een, yet &s;uch as in other circum&s;tances I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to offer you." St. Aubert acknowledged how much he felt him&s;elf obliged by this kind|ne&s;s, but refu&s;ed to accept it till the young &s;tranger would take no denial. "Do not give me the pain of knowing, &s;ir," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> "that an invalid, like you, lies on hard &s;kins, while I &s;leep in a bed. Be&s;ides, &s;ir, your refu&s;al wounds my pride; I mu&s;t believe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> you think my offer unworthy your acceptance. Let me &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> you the way. I have no doubt my landlady can accommodate this young lady al&s;o."</P>
<P>St. Aubert, at length con&s;ented, that, if this could be do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he would accept his kindne&s;s, though he felt rather &s;urpri&s;ed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the &s;tranger had proved him&s;elf &s;o deficient in gallantry, as to ad|mini&s;ter to the repo&s;e of an infirm man, rather than to that of a very lovely young woman, for he had not once offered the room for Emily. But &s;he thought not of her&s;elf, and the animated &s;mile &s;he gave him, told how much &s;he felt her&s;elf obliged for the preference of her father.</P>
<P>On their way, the &s;tranger, who&s;e name was Valancourt, &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p|ped on fir&s;t to &s;peak to his ho&s;te&s;s, and &s;he came out to welcome St. Aubert into a cottage, much &s;uperior to any he had &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. This good woman &s;eemed very willing to accommodate the &s;trangers, who were &s;oon compelled to accept the only two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the place. Eggs and milk were the only food the cottage afforded; but again&s;t &s;carcity of provi&s;ions St. Aubert had pro|vided, and he reque&s;ted Valancourt to &s;tay, and partake with him of le&s;s homely fare; an invitation, which was readily ac|cepted, and they pa&s;&s;ed an hour in intelligent conver&s;ation. St. Aubert was much plea&s;ed with the manly frankne&s;s, &s;implicity, and keen &s;u&s;ceptibility to the grandeur of nature, which his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> acquaintance di&s;covered; and, indeed, he had often been heard to &s;ay, that, without a certain &s;implicity of heart, this ta&s;te could not exi&s;t in any &s;trong degree.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was interrupted by a violent uproar without, in which the voice of the muleteer was heard above every other &s;ound. Valancourt &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and went to inquire the occa&s;ion; but the di&s;pute continued &s;o long afterwards, that St. Aubert went him&s;elf, and found Michael quarrelling with the ho&s;te&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he had refu&s;ed to let his mules lie in a little room where he and three of her &s;ons were to pa&s;s the night.
<PB N="37" REF="029378_0019_0FE07D93EBFD4AA0">
The place was wretched enough, but there was no other for the&s;e people to &s;leep in; and with&s;omewhat more of delicacy than was u&s;ual among the inhabitants of this wild tract of coun|try, &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to let the animals have the &s;ame <HI>bed|chamber</HI> with her children. This was a tender point with the muleteer; his honour was wounded when his mules were treated with di&s;re&s;pect&punc; and he would have received a blow, perhaps, with more meekne&s;s. He declared that his bea&s;ts were as hone&s;t bea&s;ts, and as good bea&s;ts, as any in the whole province; and that they had a right to be well treated wherever they went.&mdash;"They are as harmle&s;s as lambs," &s;aid he, "if people don't af|front them. I never knew them behave them&s;elves ami&s;s above once or twice in my life, and then they had good rea&s;on for do|ing &s;o. Once, indeed, they kicked at a boy's leg that lay a&s;leep in the &s;table, and broke it; but I told them they were out there, and by St. Anthony! I believe they under&s;tood me, for they never did &s;o again."</P>
<P>He concluded this eloquent harrangue with prote&s;ting, that they &s;hould &s;hare with him go where he would.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute was at length &s;ettled by Valancourt, who drew the ho&s;te&s;s a&s;ide, and de&s;ired &s;he would let the muleteer and his bea&s;ts have the place in que&s;tion to them&s;elves, while her &s;ons &s;hould have the bed of &s;kins de&s;igned for him, for that he would wrap him&s;elf in his cloak, and &s;leep on the bench by the cot|tage door. But this &s;he thought it her duty to oppo&s;e, and &s;he felt it to be her inclination to di&s;appoint the muleteer. Valan|court, however, was po&s;itive, and the tedious affair was at length &s;ettled.</P>
<P>It was late when St. Aubert and Emily retired to their rooms, and Valancourt to his &s;tation at the door, which, at this mild &s;ea&s;on, he preferred to a clo&s;e cabin and a bed of &s;kins. St. Aubert was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to find in his room volumes of Homer, Horace and Petrach; but the name of Valancourt, written in them, told him to whom they belonged.</P>

<BIBL>THE MINSTREL.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ST. Aubert awoke at an early hour, refre&s;hed by &s;leep, and de&s;irous to &s;et forward. He invited the &s;tranger to breakfa&s;t with him; and, talking again of the road, Valancourt &s;aid, that, &s;ome months pa&s;t, he had travelled as far as Beaujeu, which was a town of &s;ome con&s;equence on the way to Rou&s;illon. He recommended it to St. Aubert to take that route, and the latter determined to do &s;o.</P>
<P>"The road from this hamlet," &s;aid Valancourt, "and that to Beaujeu, part at the di&s;tance of about a league and an half from hence; if you will give me leave, I will direct your muleteer &s;o far. I mu&s;t wander &s;omewhere, and your company would make this a plea&s;anter ramble than any other I could take."</P>
<P>St. Aubert thankfully accepted his offer, and they &s;et out to|gether, the young &s;tranger on foot, for he refu&s;ed the invitation of St. Aubert to take a &s;eat in his little carriage.</P>
<P>The road wound along the feet of the mountains through a pa&s;toral valley, bright with verdure, and varied with groves of dwarf oak, beech, and &s;ycamore, under who&s;e branches herds of cattle repo&s;ed. The mountain-a&s;h too, and the weeping birch, often threw their pendant foliage over the &s;teeps above, where the &s;canty &s;oil &s;carcely concealed their roots, and where their light branches waved to every breeze that fluttered from the mountains.</P>
<P>The travellers were frequently met at this early hour, for the &s;un had not yet ri&s;en upon the valley, by &s;hepherds driving im|men&s;e flocks from their folds to &s;eed upon the hills. St. Au|bert had &s;et out thus early, not only that he might enjoy the fir&s;t appearance of &s;unri&s;e, but that he might inhale the fir&s;t pure breath of morning, which above all things is refre&s;hing to the &s;pirits of the invalid. In the&s;e regions it was particularly &s;o,
<PB N="39" REF="029378_0020_0FE07D988E9A6F10">
where an abundance of wild flowers and aromatic herbs breathed forth their e&s;&s;ence on the air.</P>
<P>The dawn, which &s;oftened the &s;cenery with its peculiar grey tint, now di&s;per&s;ed, and Emily watched the progre&s;s of the day, fir&s;t trembling on the tops of the highe&s;t cliffs, then touching them with &s;plendid light, while their &s;ides and the vale below were &s;till wrapt in dewy mi&s;t. Meanwhile the &s;ullen grey of the ea&s;tern clouds began to blu&s;h, then to redden, and then to glow with a thou&s;and colours, till the golden light darted over all the air, touched the lower points of the mountain's brow, and glanced in long &s;loping beams upon the valley and its &s;tream. All nature &s;eemed to have awakened from death into life; the &s;pirit of St. Aubert was renovated. His heart was full; he wept, and his thoughts a&s;cended to the Great Creator.</P>
<P>Emily wi&s;hed to trip along the turf, &s;o green and bright with dew, and to ta&s;te the full delight of that liberty, which the izard &s;eemed to enjoy as he bounded along the brow of the cliffs; while Valancourt often &s;topped to &s;peak with the travellers, and with &s;ocial feeling to point out to them the peculiar objects of his admiration. St. Aubert was plea&s;ed with him: "Here is the real ingenuou&s;ne&s;s and ardour of youth," &s;aid he to him&s;elf; "this young man has never been at Paris."</P>
<P>He was &s;orry when they came to the &s;pot where the roads part|ed, and his heart took a more affectionate leave of him than is u&s;ual after &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance. Valancourt talked long by the &s;ide of the carriage; &s;eemed more than once to be going, but &s;till lingered, and appeared to &s;earch anxiou&s;ly for topics of conver&s;ation to account for his delay. At length he took leave. As he went, St. Aubert ob&s;erved him look with an earne&s;t and pen&s;ive eye at Emily, who bowed to him with a countenance full of timid &s;weetne&s;s, while the carriage drove on. St. Au|bert, for whatever rea&s;on, &s;oon after looked from the window, and &s;aw Valancourt &s;tanding upon the bank of the road, re&s;ting on his pike with folded arms, and following the carriage with his eyes. He waved his hand, and Valancourt, &s;eeming to awake from his reverie, returned the &s;alute, and &s;tarted away.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of the country now began to change, and the tra|vellers &s;oon found them&s;elves among mountains covered from their ba&s;e nearly to their &s;ummits with fore&s;ts of gloomy pine, except where a rock of granite &s;hot up from the vale, and lo&s;t its &s;nowy top in the clouds. The rivulet, which had hitherto accompanied them, now expanded into a river; and, flowing deeply and &s;ilently along, reflected, as in a mirror, the blackne&s;s
<PB N="40" REF="029378_0021_0FE07DA332775B78">
of the impending &s;hades. Sometimes a cliff was &s;een lifting i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> bold head above the woods and the vapours, that floated mid-way down the mountains; and &s;ometimes a face of perpendicular marble ro&s;e from the water's edge, over which the larch threw his gigantic arms, here &s;cathed with lightning, and there floating i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> luxuriant foliage.</P>
<P>They continued to travel over a rough and unfrequented road, &s;eeing now and then at a di&s;tance the &s;olitary &s;hepherd, with his dog, &s;talking along the valley, and hearing only the da&s;hing of torrents, which the woods concealed from the eye, the long &s;ul|len murmur of the breeze, as it &s;wept over the pines, or the notes of the eagle and the vulture, which were &s;een towering round the beetling cliff.</P>
<P>Often, as the carriage moved &s;lowly over uneven ground, St. Aubert alighted, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf with examining the cu|rious plants that grew on the banks of the road, and with which the&s;e regions abound; while Emily, wrapt in high enthu&s;ia&s;m, wandered away under the &s;hades, li&s;tening in deep &s;ilence to the lonely murmur of the woods.</P>
<P>Neither village nor hamlet were &s;een for many leagues; the goat-herd's or the hunter's cabin, perched among the cliffs of the rocks, were the only human habitations that appeared.</P>
<P>The travellers again took their dinner in the open air, on a plea&s;ant &s;pot in the valley, under the &s;preading &s;hade of cedars; and then &s;et forward towards Beaujeu.</P>
<P>The road now began to a&s;cend, and, leaving the pine fore&s;ts behind, wound among rocky precipices. The evening twilight again fell over the &s;cene, and the travellers were ignorant how far they might yet be from Beaujeu. St. Aubert, however, con|jectured that the di&s;tance could not be very great, and comforted him&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of travelling on a more frequented road after reaching that town, where he de&s;igned to pa&s;s the night.&mdash;Mingled woods, and rocks, and heathy mountains were now &s;een ob&s;curely through the du&s;k; but &s;oon even the&s;e imperfect ima|ges faded in darkne&s;s. Michael proceeded with caution, for he could &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;h the road; his mules, however, &s;eemed to have more &s;agacity, and their &s;teps were &s;ure.</P>
<P>On turning the angle of a mountain, a light appeared at a di&s;|tance, that illuminated the rocks, and the horizon to a great ex|tent. It was evidently a large fire, but whether accidental, or otherwi&s;e, there were no means of knowing. St. Aubert thought it was probably kindled by &s;ome of the numerous ban|ditti, that infe&s;ted the Pyrenees, and he became watchful and
<PB N="41" REF="029378_0021_0FE07DA332775B78">
anxious to know whether the road pa&s;&s;ed near this fire. He had arms with him, which on an emergency, might afford &s;ome protection, though certainly a very unequal one, again&s;t a band of robbers, &s;o de&s;perate too as tho&s;e u&s;ually were who haunted the&s;e wild regions. While many reflections ro&s;e upon his mind, he heard a voice &s;houting from the road behind, and ordering the muleteer to &s;top. St. Aubert bade him proceed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; but either Michael or his mules were ob&s;tinate, for they did not quit the old pace. Hor&s;es' feet were now heard; a man rode up to the carriage, &s;till ordering the driver to &s;top; and St. Aubert, who could no longer doubt his purpo&s;e, was with difficulty able to prepare a pi&s;tol for his defence, when his hand was upon the door of the chai&s;e. The man &s;taggered on his hor&s;e, the report of the pi&s;tol was followed by a groan, and St. Aubert's horror may be imagined, when in the next in&s;tant he thought he heard the faint voice of Valancourt. He now him&s;elf bade the muleteer &s;top; and pronouncing the name of Valan|court, was an&s;wered in a voice, that no longer &s;uffered him to doubt. St. Aubert, who in&s;tantly alighted and went to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, found him &s;till &s;itting on his hor&s;e, but bleeding pro|fu&s;ely, and appearing to be in great pain, though he endeavoured to &s;often the terror of St. Aubert by a&s;&s;urances that he was not materially hurt, the wound being only in his arm. St. Aubert, with the muleteer a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to di&s;mount, and he &s;at down on the bank of the road, where St. Aubert tried to bind up his arm, but his hands trembled &s;o exce&s;&s;ively that he could not accom|pli&s;h it; and, Michael being now gone in pur&s;uit of the hor&s;e, which, on being di&s;engaged from his rider, had galloped off, he called Emily to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Receiving no an&s;wer, he went to the carriage, and found her &s;unk on the &s;eat in a fainting fit.&mdash;Between the di&s;tre&s;s of this circum&s;tance and that of leaving Valancourt bleeding, he &s;carcely knew what he did; he endea|voured, however, to rai&s;e her, and called to Michael to fetch water from the rivulet that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">owed by the road, but Michael was gone beyond the reach of his voice. Valancourt, who heard the&s;e calls, and al&s;o the repeated name of Emily, in&s;tantly un|der&s;tood the &s;ubject of his di&s;tre&s;s; and, almo&s;t forgetting his own condition, he ha&s;tened to her relief. She was reviving when he reached the carriage; and then, under&s;tanding that anxiety for him had occa&s;ioned her indi&s;po&s;ition, he a&s;&s;ured her, in a voice that trembled, but not from angui&s;h, that his wound was of no con&s;equence. While he &s;aid this St. Aubert turned round, and perceiving that he was &s;till bleeding, the &s;ubject of
<PB N="42" REF="029378_0022_0FE07DA8E7EB44D0">
his alarm changed again, and he ha&s;tily formed &s;ome hankerchiefs into a bandage. This &s;topped the effu&s;ion of the blood; but St. Aubert, dreading the con&s;equence of the wound, inquired re|peatedly how far they were from Beaujeu; when, learning that it was at two leagues di&s;tance, his di&s;tre&s;s increa&s;ed, &s;ince he knew not how Valancourt, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, would bear the motion of the carriage, and perceived that he was already faint from lo&s;s of blood. When he mentioned the &s;ubject of his anx|iety, Valancourt entreated that he would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be thus alarmed on his account, for that he had no doubt he &s;hould be able to &s;upport him&s;elf very well; and then he talked of the accident as a &s;light one. The muleteer being now re|turned with Valancourt's hor&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him into the chai&s;e; and as Emily was now revived, they moved &s;lowed on towards Beaujeu.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, when he had recovered from the terror occa&s;ioned him by this accident, expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e on &s;eeing Valancourt, who explained his unexpected appearance by &s;aying, "You, Sir, renewed my ta&s;te for &s;ociety; when you had left the hamlet, it did indeed appear a &s;olitude. I determined, therefore, &s;ince my object was merely amu&s;ement, to change the &s;cene; and I took this road, becau&s;e I knew it led through a more romantic tract of mouutains than the &s;pot I have left. Be&s;ides," added he, he&s;itating for an in&s;tant. "I will own, and why &s;hould I not? that I had &s;ome hope of overtaking you."</P>
<P>"And I have made you a very unexpected return for the com|pliment," &s;aid St. Aubert, who lamented again the ra&s;hne&s;s which had produced the accident, and explained the cau&s;e of his late alarm. But Valancourt &s;eemed anxious only to remove from the minds of his companions every unplea&s;ant feeling relative to him&s;elf; and, for that purpo&s;e, &s;till &s;truggled again&s;t a &s;en&s;e of pain, and tried to conver&s;e with gaiety. Emily meanwhile was &s;ilent, except when Valancourt particularly addre&s;&s;ed her, and there was at tho&s;e times a tremulous tone in his voice that &s;poke much.</P>
<P>They were now &s;o near the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, which had long flamed at a di&s;tance on the blackne&s;s of night, that it gleamed upon the road, and they could di&s;tingui&s;h figures moving about the blaze. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> way winding &s;till nearer they perceived in the valley one of tho&s;e numerous bands of gip&s;ies, which at that period par|ticularly haunted the wilds of the Pyrenees, and lived partly by plundering the traveller. Emily looked with &s;ome degree of terror on the &s;avage countenances of the&s;e people, &s;hewn by the
<PB N="43" REF="029378_0022_0FE07DA8E7EB44D0">
fire, which heightened the romantic effect of the &s;cenery, as it threw a red du&s;ky gleam upon the rocks and on the foliage of the trees, leaving heavy ma&s;&s;es of &s;hade and regions of ob&s;curity, which the eye feared to penetrate.</P>
<P>They were preparing their &s;upper; a large pot &s;tood by the fire, over which &s;everal figures were bu&s;y. The blaze di&s;cover|ed a rude kind of tent, round which many children and dogs were playing, and the whole formed a picture highly grote&s;que. The travellers &s;aw plainly their danger. Valancourt was &s;ilent, but laid his hand on one of St. Aubert's pi&s;tols; St. Aubert drew forth another, and Michael was ordered to proceed as fa&s;t as po&s;|&s;ible. They pa&s;&s;ed the place, however, without being attacked; the rovers being probably unprepared for the opportunity, and too bu&s;y about their &s;upper to feel much intere&s;t, at the moment, in any thing be&s;ides.</P>
<P>After a league and a half more, pa&s;&s;ed in darkne&s;s, the travel|lers arrived at Beaujeu, and drove up to the only inn the place afforded; which, though &s;uperior to any they had &s;een &s;ince they entered the mountains, was bad enough.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon of the town was immediately &s;ent for, if a &s;ur|geon he could be called, who pre&s;cribed for hor&s;es as well as for men, and &s;haved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aces at lea&s;t as dexterou&s;ly as he &s;et bones. After examining Valancourt's arm, and perceiving that the bullet had pa&s;&s;ed through the fle&s;h without touching the bone, he dre&s;&s;|ed it, and left him with a &s;olemn pre&s;cription of quiet, which his patient was not inclined to obey. The delight of ea&s;e had now &s;ucceeded to pain; for ea&s;e may be allowed to a&s;&s;ume a po&s;itive quality when contra&s;ted with angui&s;h; and, his &s;pirits thus re-animated, he wi&s;hed to partake of the conver&s;ation of St. Aubert and Emily, who, relea&s;ed from &s;o many apprehen&s;ions, were uncommonly cheerful. Late as it was, however, St. Au|bert was obliged to go out with the landlord to buy meat for &s;upper; and Emily, who, during this interval, had been ab&s;ent as long as &s;he could, upon excu&s;es of looking to their accommo|dation, which &s;he found rather better than &s;he expected, was compelled to return, and conver&s;e with Valancourt alone. They talked of the character of the &s;cenes they had pa&s;&s;ed, of the nat|ural hi&s;tory of the country, of poetry, and of St. Aubert; a &s;ub|ject on which Emily always &s;poke and li&s;tened to with peculiar plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The travellers pa&s;&s;ed an agreeable evening, but St. Aubert was fatigued with his journey; and, as Valancourt &s;eemed again &s;en&s;ible of pain, they &s;eparated &s;oon after &s;upper.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="029378_0023_0FE07DB7CB332448">
In the morning St. Aubert found that Valancourt had pa&s;&s;ion a re&s;tle&s;s night; that he was feveri&s;h, and his wound very pain|ful. The &s;urgeon, when he dre&s;&s;ed it, advi&s;ed him to remain quietly at Beaujeu; advice which was to rea&s;onable to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|jected. St. Aubert, however, had no favourable opinion of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> practitioner, and was anxious to commit Valancourt into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;kilful hands; but learning, upon inquiry, that there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> town within &s;everal leagues which &s;eemed more likely to afford better advice, he altered the plan of his journey, and determine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to await the recovery of Valancourt, who, with &s;omewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ceremony than &s;incerity, made many objections to this delay.</P>
<P>By order of his &s;urgeon Valancourt did not go out of the hou&s;e that day, but St. Aubert and Emily &s;urveyed with delight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> environs of the town, &s;ituated at the feet of the Pyrenean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that ro&s;e, &s;ome in abrupt precipices, and others &s;welling with woods of cedar, fir, and cypre&s;s, which &s;tretched nearly to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> highe&s;t &s;ummits. The cheerful green of the beech and moun|tain-a&s;h was &s;ometimes &s;een, like a gleam of light, amid&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dark verdure of the fore&s;t; and &s;ometimes a torrent poured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;parkling flood, high among the woods.</P>
<P>Valancourt's indi&s;po&s;ition detained the travellers at Beaujeu &s;everal days, during which interval St. Aubert had ob&s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;potion and his talents with the philo&s;ophic inquiry &s;o nature<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to him. He &s;aw a frank and generous nature, full of ardour highly &s;u&s;ceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful, but impet|uous, wild, and &s;omewhat romantic. Valancourt had known little of the world. His perceptions were clear, and his feeling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ju&s;t; his indignation of an unworthy, or his admiration of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> generous action, were expre&s;&s;ed in terms of equal vehemence. St. Aubert &s;ometimes &s;miled at his warmth, but &s;eldom checked it, and often repeated to him&s;elf, "This young man has never been at Paris." A &s;igh &s;ometimes followed this &s;ilent ejaculation. He determined not to leave Valancourt till he &s;hould be perfectly recovered; and, as he was now well enough to travel, though not able to manage his hor&s;e, St. Aubert invited him to accompany him for a few days in the carriage. This he the more readily did, &s;ince he had di&s;covered that Valancourt was of a family of the &s;ame name in Ga&s;cony, with who&s;e re&s;pectability he was well acquainted. The latter accepted the offer with great plea|&s;ure, and they again &s;et forward among the&s;e romantic wilds to|wards Rou&s;illon.</P>
<P>They travelled lei&s;urely; &s;topping wherever a &s;cene uncom|monly grand appeared; frequently alighting to walk to an em|inence,
<PB N="45" REF="029378_0023_0FE07DB7CB332448">
whither the mules could not go, from which the pro&s;pect opened in greater magnificence; and often &s;auntering over hil|locks covered with lavender, wild thyme, juniper, and tamari&s;c; and under the &s;hades of woods, between who&s;e boles they caught the long mountain-vi&s;ta, &s;ublime beyond any thing that Emily had ever imagined.</P>
<P>St. Aubert &s;ometimes amu&s;ed him&s;elf with botanizing, while Valancourt and Emily &s;trolled on; he pointed out to her notice the objects that particularly charmed him, and reciting beauti|ful pa&s;&s;ages from &s;uch of the Latin and Italian poets as he had heard her admire. In the pau&s;es of conver&s;ation, when he thought him&s;elf not ob&s;erved, he frequently fixed his eyes pen&s;ively on her countenance, which expre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much animation the ta&s;te and energy of her mind; and when he &s;poke again, there was a peculiar tenderne&s;s in the tone of his voice, that defeated any attempt to conceal his &s;entiments. By degrees the&s;e &s;ilent pau&s;es became more frequent; till Emily, only, betrayed an anx|iety to interrupt them; and &s;he, who had been hitherto re&s;erved, would now talk again, and again, of the woods and the vallies and the mountains, to avoid the danger of &s;ympathy and &s;ilence.</P>
<P>From Beaujeu the road had con&s;tantly a&s;cended, conducting the travellers into the higher regions of the air, where immen&s;e glaciers exhibited their frozen horrors, and eternal &s;now whiten|ed the &s;ummits of the mountains. They often pau&s;ed to con|template the&s;e &s;tupendous &s;cenes, and &s;eated on &s;ome wild cliff, where only the ilex or the larch could flouri&s;h, looked over dark fore&s;ts of fir, and precipices where human foot had never wan|dered, into the glen&mdash;&s;o deep, that the thunder of the torrent, which was &s;een to foam along the bottom, was &s;carcely heard to murmur. Over the&s;e crags ro&s;e others of &s;tupendous height, and fanta&s;tic &s;hape; &s;ome &s;hooting into cones; others impending far over their ba&s;e, in huge ma&s;&s;es of granite, along who&s;e broken ridges was often lodged a weight of &s;now, that trembling even to the vibration of a &s;ound, threatened to bear de&s;truction in its cour&s;e to the vale. Around, on every &s;ide, far as the eye could penetrate, were &s;een only forms of grandeur&mdash;the long per&s;pective of mountain tops, tinged with ethereal blue, or white with &s;now; vallies of ice, and fore&s;ts of gloomy fir. The &s;eren|ity and clearne&s;s of the air in the&s;e high regions were particu|larly delightful to the travellers; it &s;eemed to in&s;pire them with a finer &s;pirit, and diffu&s;ed an inde&s;cribable complacency over their minds. They had no words to expre&s;s the &s;ublime emotions they felt. A &s;olemn expre&s;&s;ion characteri&s;ed the feelings of St.
<PB N="46" REF="029378_0024_0FE07DBC5BB7BBD0">

Valancourt now and then &s;po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to point to Emily's notice &s;ome feature of the &s;cene. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thinne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere, through which every object ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;o di&s;tinctly to the eye, &s;urpri&s;ed and deluded her; who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;carcely believe that objects, which appeared &s;o near, were, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ality, &s;o di&s;tant. The deep &s;ilence of the&s;e &s;olitudes was broke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> only at intervals by the &s;cream of the vultures, &s;een cowering round &s;ome cliff below, or by the cry of the eagle &s;ailing hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the air; except when the travellers li&s;tened to the holl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> thunder that &s;ometimes muttered at their feet. While, about the deep blue of the heavens was unob&s;cured by the lighte&s;t cloud half way down the mountains, long billows of vapour were fre|quently &s;een rolling, now wholly excluding the country belo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and now opening, and partially revealing its features. Emily delighted to ob&s;erve the grandeur of the&s;e clouds as they chang|ed in &s;hape and tints, and to watch their various effect on the lower world, who&s;e features, partly veiled, were continually a&s;|&s;uming new forms of &s;ublimity.</P>
<P>After traver&s;ing the&s;e regions for many leagues, they beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to de&s;cend towards Rou&s;illon, and features of beauty then min|gled with the &s;cene. Yet the travellers did not look back without &s;ome regret to the &s;ublime objects they had quitted; though the eye, fatigued with the exten&s;ion of its powers, was glad to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|po&s;e on the verdure of woods and pa&s;tures, that now hung <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the margin of the river below; to view again the humble cot|tage &s;haded by cedars, and playful group of mountaineer-children and the flowery nooks that appeared among the hills.</P>
<P>As they de&s;cended, they &s;aw at a di&s;tance, on the right, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the grand pa&s;&s;es of the Pyrenees into Spain, gleaming with i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> battlements and towers to the &s;plendour of the &s;etting rays, yellow tops of woods colouring the &s;teeps below, while far above a&s;pired the &s;nowy points of the mountains, &s;till reflecting a ro&s;y hue.</P>
<P>St. Aubert began to look out for the little town he had been directed to by the people of Beaujeu, and where he meant to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the night; but no habitation yet appeared. Of its di&s;tance Valancourt could not a&s;&s;i&s;t him to judge, for he had never been &s;o far along this chain of Alps before. There was, however, a road to guide them; and there could be little doubt that it was the right one; for, &s;ince they had left Beaujeu, there had been no variety of tracks to perplex or mi&s;lead.</P>
<P>The &s;un now gave his la&s;t light, and St. Aubert bade the mu|leteer proceed with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. He found, indeed, the
<PB N="47" REF="029378_0024_0FE07DBC5BB7BBD0">
la&s;&s;itude of illne&s;s return upon him, after a day of uncommon fatigue, both of body and mind, and he longed for repo&s;e. His anxiety was not &s;oothed by ob&s;erving a numerous train, con&s;i&s;t|ing of men, hor&s;es, and loaded mules, winding down the &s;teeps of an oppo&s;ite mountain, appearing and di&s;appearing at intervals among the woods, &s;o that its numbers could not be judged of. Something bright, like arms, glanced in the &s;etting ray, and the military dre&s;s was di&s;tingui&s;hable upon the men who were in the van, and on others &s;cattered among the troop that followed. As the&s;e wound into the vale, the rear of the party emerged from the woods, and exhibited a band of &s;oldiers. St. Aubert's ap|prehen&s;ions now &s;ub&s;ided; he had no doubt that the train before him con&s;i&s;ted of &s;mugglers, who, in conveying prohibited goods over the Pyrenees, had been encountered, and conquered by a party of troops.</P>
<P>The travellers had lingered &s;o long among the &s;ublimer &s;cenes of the&s;e mountains, that they found them&s;elves entirely mi&s;taken in their calculation that they could reach Montigny at &s;un&s;et; but as they wound along the valley, they &s;aw, on a rude Alpine bridge, that united two lofty crags of the glen, a group of mountaineer-children, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with dropping pebbles into a torrent below, and watching the &s;tones plunge into the water, that threw up its white &s;pray high in the air as it re|ceived them, and returned a &s;ullen &s;ound, which the echoes of the mountains prolonged. Under the bridge was &s;een a per|&s;pective of the valley, with its cataract de&s;cending among the rocks, and a cottage on a cliff, over&s;hadowed with pines. It ap|peared, that they could not be far from &s;ome &s;mall town. St. Aubert bade the muleteer &s;top, and then called to the children to inquire if he was near Montigny; but the di&s;tance, and the roar|ing of the waters, would not &s;uffer his voice to be heard; and the crags adjoining the bridge, were of &s;uch tremendous height and &s;teepne&s;s, that to have climbed either would have been &s;carcely practicable to a per&s;on unacquainted with the a&s;cent. St. Aubert, therefore, did not wa&s;te more moments in delay. They contin|ued to travel long after twilight had ob&s;cured the road, which was &s;o broken, that now thinking it &s;afer to walk than to ride, they all alighted. The moon was ri&s;ing, but her light was yet too feeble to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. While they &s;tepped carefully on, they heard the ve&s;per-bell of a convent. The twilight would not permit them to di&s;tingui&s;h any thing like a building, but the &s;ounds &s;eemed to come from &s;ome woods, that overhung an ac|clivity to the right. Valancourt propo&s;ed to go in &s;earch of this
<PB N="48" REF="029378_0025_0FE07DCA67F89AE0">
convent. "If they will not accommodate us with a night lodging," &s;aid he, "they may certainly inform us how far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are from Montigny, and direct us towards it." He was bound|ing forward, without waiting St. Aubert's reply, when the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ter &s;topped him. "I am very weary," &s;aid St. Aubert, "and wi&s;h for nothing &s;o much as for immediate re&s;t. We will all go to the convent; your good looks would defeat our purpo&s;e; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> when they &s;ee mine and Emily's exhau&s;ted countenances, they will &s;carcely deny us repo&s;e."</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he took Emily's arm within his, and telling Michael to wait a while in the road with the carriage, they be|gan to a&s;cend towards the woods, guided by the bell of the con|vent. His &s;teps were feeble, and Valancourt offered him his arm, which he accepted. The moon now threw a faint light over their path, and, &s;oon after, enabled them to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome towers ri&s;ing above the tops of the woods. Still following the note of the bell, they entered the &s;hade of tho&s;e woods, lighted only by the moonbeams, that glided down between the leaves and threw a tremulous uncertain gleam upon the &s;teep track they were winding. The gloom and the &s;ilence that prevailed, ex|cept when the bell returned upon the air, together with the wildne&s;s of the &s;urrounding &s;cene, &s;truck Emily with a degree of fear, which, however, the voice and conver&s;ation of Valan|court &s;omewhat repre&s;&s;ed. When they had been &s;ometime a&s;|cending, St. Aubert complained of wearine&s;s, and they &s;topped to re&s;t upon a little green &s;ummit, where the trees opened, and admitted the moonlight. He &s;at down upon the turf, between Emily and Valancourt. The bell had now cea&s;ed, and the deep repo&s;e of the &s;cene was undi&s;turbed by any &s;ound, for the low dull murmur of &s;ome di&s;tant torrents might be &s;aid to &s;oot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> rather than to interrupt, the &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Before them, extended the valley they had quitted; its rocks, and woods to the left, ju&s;t &s;ilvered by the rays, formed a con|tra&s;t to the deep &s;hadow that involved the oppo&s;ite cliffs, who&s;e fringed &s;ummits only were tipped with light; while the di&s;tant per&s;pective of the valley was lo&s;t in the yellow mi&s;t of moon|light. The travellers &s;at for &s;ometime wrapt in the complacen|cy which &s;uch &s;cenes in&s;pire.</P>
<P>"The&s;e &s;cenes," &s;aid Valancourt, at length, &s;often the heart, like the notes of &s;weet mu&s;ic, and in&s;pire that delicious melan|choly which no per&s;on, who had felt it once, would re&s;ign for the gaye&s;t plea&s;ures. They waken our be&s;t and pure&s;t feelings, di&s;po&s;ing us to benevolence, pity, and friend&s;hip. Tho&s;e whom
<PB N="49" REF="029378_0025_0FE07DCA67F89AE0">
I love&mdash;I always &s;eem to love more in &s;uch an hour as this." His voice trembled and he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was &s;ilent; Emily perceived a warm tear fall upon the hand he held; &s;he knew the object of his thoughts; hers too had, for &s;ometime, been occupied by the remembrance of her mother. He &s;eemed by an effort to rou&s;e him&s;elf. "Yes," &s;aid he with a half-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;igh, "the memory of tho&s;e we love&mdash;of times for ever pa&s;t! in &s;uch an hour as this &s;teals upon the mind, like a &s;train of di&s;tant mu&s;ic in the &s;tillne&s;s of night,&mdash;all tender and harmonious as this land&s;cape, &s;leeping in the mel|low moonlight." After the pau&s;e of a moment, St. Aubert ad|ded, "I have always fancied, that I thought with more clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion, at &s;uch an hour than at any other, and that heart mu&s;t be in&s;en&s;ible in a great degree, that does not &s;often to its influence. But many &s;uch there are."</P>
<P>Valancourt &s;ighed.</P>
<P>"Are there, indeed, many &s;uch?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"A few years hence, my Emily," replied St. Aubert, "and you may &s;mile at the recollection of that que&s;tion&mdash;if you do not weep to it. But come, I am &s;omewhat refre&s;hed, let us proceed."</P>
<P>Having emerged from the woods, that &s;aw, upon a turfy hil|lock above, the convent of which they were in &s;earch. An high wall that &s;urrounded it, led them to an ancient gate, at which they knocked; and the poor monk who opened it, conducted them into a &s;mall adjoining room, where he de&s;ired they would wait while he informed the &s;uperior of their reque&s;t. In this interval, &s;everal friars came in &s;eparately to look at them; and at length the fir&s;t monk returned, and they followed him to a room, where the &s;uperior was &s;itting in an armchair, with a large folio volume, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in black letter, open on a de&s;k before him. He received them with courte&s;y, though he did not ri&s;e from his &s;eat; and, having a&s;ked them a few que&s;tions, granted their reque&s;t. After a &s;hort conver&s;ation, formal and &s;olemn on the part of the &s;uperior, they withdrew to the apartment where they were to &s;up, and Valancourt, whom one of the inferior fri|ars civilly de&s;ired to accompany, went to &s;eek Michael and his mules. They had not de&s;cended half way down the cliffs, be|fore they heard the voice of the muleteer echoing &s;ar and wide. Sometimes her called on St. Aubert, and &s;ometimes on Valan|court; who having at length, convinced him that he had noth|ing to fear either for him&s;elf, or his ma&s;ter; and having di&s;po&s;ed of him, for the night, in a cottage on the &s;kirts of the woods, returned to &s;up with his friends, on &s;uch &s;ober fare as the monks
<PB N="50" REF="029378_0026_0FE07DCFA5F7ECC8">
thought it prudent to &s;et before them. While St. Aubert was too much indi&s;po&s;ed to &s;hare it, Emily, in her anxiety for her father, forgot her&s;elf; and Valancourt, &s;ilent and thoughtful, yet never inattentive to them, appeared particularly &s;olicitous to ac|commodate and relieve St. Aubert, who often ob&s;erved, while his daughter was pre&s;&s;ing him to eat, or adju&s;ting the pillow &s;he had placed in the back of his armchair, that Valancourt fixed on her a look of pen&s;ive tenderne&s;s, which he was not di&s;plea&s;ed to under&s;tand.</P>
<P>They &s;eparated at an early hour, and retired to their re&s;pect|ive apartments. Emily was &s;hown to hers by a nun of the con|vent, whom &s;he was glad to di&s;mi&s;s, for her heart was melancho|ly, and her attention &s;o much ab&s;tracted, that conver&s;ation with a &s;tranger was painful. She thought her father daily declining and attributed his pre&s;ent fatigue more to the feeble &s;tate of his frame, than to the difficulty of the journey. A train of gloomy ideas haunted her mind, till &s;he fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>In about two hours after, &s;he was awakened by the chiming of a bell, and then heard quick &s;teps pa&s;s along the gallery, into which her chamber opened. She was &s;o little accu&s;tomed to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> manners of a convent, as to be alarmed by this circum&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her fears, ever alive for her father, &s;ugge&s;ted that he was very ill, and &s;he ro&s;e in ha&s;te to go to him. Having pau&s;ed, how|ever, to let the per&s;ons in the gallery pa&s;s before &s;he opened her door, her thoughts, in the mean time, recovered from the confu|&s;ion of &s;leep, and &s;he under&s;tood that the bell was the call of the monks to prayers. It had now cea&s;ed, and, all being again &s;till, &s;he forbore to go to St. Aubert's room. Her mind was not di&s;po&s;ed for immediate &s;leep, and the moonlight, that &s;hone in|to her chamber, invited her to open the ca&s;ement, and look out upon the country.</P>
<P>It was a &s;till and beautiful night, the &s;ky was unob&s;cured by any cloud, and &s;carce a leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the air. As &s;he li&s;tened, the midnight hymn of the monks ro&s;e &s;oftly from a chapel, that &s;tood on one of the lower cliffs, an ho|ly &s;train, that &s;eemed to a&s;cend through the &s;ilence of night to heaven, and her thoughts a&s;cended with it. From the con&s;ider|ation of his works, her mind aro&s;e to the adoration of the Deity, in his goodne&s;s and power; wherever &s;he turned her view, whe|ther on the &s;leeping earth, or to the va&s;t regions of &s;pace, glow|ing with worlds beyond the reach of human thought, the &s;ublim|ity of God, and the maje&s;ty of his pre&s;ence appeared. Her eyes were filled with tears of awful love and admiration; and
<PB N="51" REF="029378_0026_0FE07DCFA5F7ECC8">
&s;he felt that pure devotion, &s;uperior to all the di&s;tinctions of hu|man &s;y&s;tem, which lifts the &s;oul above this world, and &s;eems to expand it into a nobler nature; &s;uch devotion as can, perhaps, only be experienced, when the mind, re&s;cued, for a moment, from the humblene&s;s of earthly con&s;iderations, a&s;pires to contem|plate His power in the &s;ublimity of His works, and His goodne&s;s in the infinity of His ble&s;&s;ings.</P>

<P>The midnight chant of the monks &s;oon after dropped into &s;i|lence; but Emily remained at the ca&s;ement, watching the &s;et|ting moon, and the valley &s;mking into deep &s;hade, and willing to prolong her pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind.

<P>ST. Aubert, &s;ufficiently re&s;tored by a night's repo&s;e to pur&s;ue his journey, &s;et out in the morning, with his family and Valan|court, for Rou&s;illon, which he hoped to reach before night-fall. The &s;cenes, through which they now pa&s;&s;ed, were as wild and romantic, as any they had yet ob&s;erved, with this difference, that beauty, every now and then, &s;oftened the land&s;cape into &s;miles. Little woody rece&s;&s;es appeared among the mountains, covered with bright verdure and flowers; or a pa&s;toral valley opened its gra&s;&s;y bo&s;om in the &s;hade of the cliffs, with flocks and herds loitering along the banks of a rivulet, that refre&s;hed it with per|petual green. St. Aubert could not repent the having taken this fatiguing road, though he was this day, al&s;o, frequently
<PB N="52" REF="029378_0027_0FE07DE01E9B8E58">
obliged to alight, to walk along the rugged precipice, and to climb the &s;teep and flinty mountain. The wonderful &s;ublimity and variety of the pro&s;pects repaid him for all this, and the en|thu&s;ia&s;m, with which they were viewed by his young companions, heightened his own, and awakened a remembrance of all the delightful emotions of his early days, when the &s;ublime charms of nature were fir&s;t unveiled to him. He found great plea&s;ure in conver&s;ing with Valancourt, and in li&s;tening to his ingenuous remarks. The fire and &s;implicity of his manners &s;eemed to render him a characteri&s;tic figure in the &s;cenes around them; and St. Aubert di&s;covered in his &s;entiments, the ju&s;tne&s;s and the dignity of an elevated mind, unbia&s;&s;ed by intercour&s;e with the world. He perceived, that his opinions were formed, rather than imbibed; were more the re&s;ult of thought, than of learn|ing. Of the world he &s;eemed to know nothing; for he be|lieved well of all mankind, and this opinion gave him the re|flected image of his own heart.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, as he &s;ometimes lingered to examine the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plants in his path, often looked forward with plea&s;ure to Emily and Valancourt, as they &s;trolled on together; he, with a counte|nance of animated delight, pointing to her attention &s;ome gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> feature of the &s;cene; and &s;he, li&s;tening and ob&s;erving with a look of tender &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;poke the elevation of her mind. They appeared like two lovers who had never &s;trayed beyond the&s;e their native mountains; who&s;e &s;ituation had &s;ecluded them from the frivolities of common life, who&s;e ideas were &s;im|ple and grand, like the land&s;capes among which they moved, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ho knew no other happine&s;s, than in the union of pure and affectionate hearts. St. Aubert &s;miled, and &s;ighed at the ro|mantic picture of felicity his fancy drew; and &s;ighed again to think, that nature and &s;implicity were &s;o little known to the world, as that their plea&s;ures were thought romantic.</P>
<P>"The world," &s;aid he, pur&s;uing this train of thought, "ridi|cules a pa&s;&s;ion which it &s;eldom feels; its &s;cenes, and its intere&s;t, di&s;tract the mind, deprave the ta&s;te, corrupt the heart, and love cannot exi&s;t in a heart that has lo&s;t the meek dignity of inno|cence. Virtue and ta&s;te are nearly the &s;ame, for virtue is little more than active ta&s;te, and the mo&s;t delicate affections of each combine in real love. How then are we to look for love in great cities, where &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation and in&s;incerity &s;upply the place of tenderne&s;s, &s;implicity and truth?"</P>
<P>It was near noon, when the travellers, having arrived at a piece of &s;teep and dangerous road, alighted to walk. The road
<PB N="53" REF="029378_0027_0FE07DE01E9B8E58">
wound up an a&s;cent, that was clothed with wood, and, in&s;tead of following the carriage, they entered the refre&s;hing &s;hade. A dewy coolne&s;s was diffu&s;ed upon the air, which, with the bright verdure of turf, that grew under the trees, the mingled fragrance of flowers and of balm, thyme, and lavender, that enriched it&punc; and the grandeur of the pines, beech, and che&s;nuts, that over|&s;hadowed them, rendered this a mo&s;t delicious retreat. Some|times, the thick foliage excluded all view of the country; at others, it admitted &s;ome partial catches of the di&s;tant &s;cenery, which gave hints to the imagination to picture land&s;capes more intere&s;ting, more impre&s;&s;ive, than any that had been pre&s;ented to the eye. The wanderers often lingered to indulge in the&s;e rev|eries of fancy.</P>
<P>The pau&s;es of &s;ilence, &s;uch as had formerly interrupted the conver&s;ations of Valancourt and Emily, were more frequent to|day than ever. Valancourt often dropped &s;uddenly from the mo&s;t animating vivacity into fits of deep mu&s;ing, and there was, &s;ometimes, an unaffected melancholy in his &s;mile, which Emily could not avoid under&s;tanding, for her heart was intere&s;ted in the &s;entiment it &s;poke.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was refre&s;hed by the &s;hades, and they continued to &s;aunter under them, following, as nearly as they could gue&s;s, the direction of the road, till they perceived that they had to|tally lo&s;t it. They had continued near the brow of the preci|pice, allured by the &s;cenery it exhibited, while the road wound far away over the cliff above. Valancourt called loudly to Michael, but heard no voice, except his own, echoing among the rocks, and his various efforts to regain the road were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful. While they were thus circum&s;tanced, they per|ceived a &s;hepherd's cabin, between the boles of the trees at &s;ome di&s;tance, and Valancourt bounded on fir&s;t to a&s;k a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;When he reached it, he &s;aw only two little children, at play, on the turf before the door. He looked into the hut, but no per&s;on was there, and the elde&s;t of the boys told him that their father was with his flocks, and their mother was gone down into the vale, but would be back pre&s;ently. As he &s;tood, con&s;idering what was further to be done, on a &s;udden he heard Michael's voice roaring forth mo&s;t manfully among the cliffs above, till he made their echoes ring. Valancourt immediately an&s;wered the call, and he endeavoured to make his way through the thicket that clothed the &s;teeps, following the direction of the &s;ound. After much &s;truggle over brambles and precipices, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reached Michael, and at length prevailed with him to be &s;ilent, and to
<PB N="54" REF="029378_0028_0FE07DE4C2D47108">
li&s;ten to him. The road was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;pot where St. Aubert and Emily were; the carriage could not ea&s;ily return to the entrance of the wood, and, &s;ince it would be very fatiguing for St. Aubert to climb the long and &s;teep road to the place where it now &s;tood, Valancourt was anxious to find a more ea&s;y a&s;cent, by the way he had him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile St. Aubert and Emily approached the cottage, and re&s;ted them&s;elves on a ru&s;tic bench, fa&s;tened between two pines, which over&s;hadowed it, till Valancourt, who&s;e &s;teps they had ob&s;erved, &s;hould return.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of the children de&s;i&s;ted from his play, and &s;tood &s;till to ob&s;erve the &s;trangers, while the younger continued his little gambols, and tea&s;ed his brother to join in them. St. Au|bert looked with plea&s;ure upon this picture of infantine &s;impli|city, till it brought to his remembrance his own boys, whom he had lo&s;t about the age of the&s;e, and their lamented mother; and he &s;unk into a thoughtfulne&s;s, which Emily ob&s;erving, &s;he immediately began to &s;ing one of tho&s;e &s;imple and lively airs he was &s;o fond of, and which &s;he knew how to give with the mo&s;t captivating &s;weetne&s;s. St. Aubert &s;miled on her through his tears, took her hand and pre&s;&s;ed it affectionately, and then tried to di&s;&s;ipate the melancloly reflections that lingered in his mind.</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;ung, Valancourt approached, who was unwilling to interrupt her, and pau&s;ed at a little di&s;tance to li&s;ten. When &s;he had concluded, he joined the party, and told them, that he had found Michael, as well as a way, by which he thought they could a&s;cend the cliff to the carriage. He pointed to the woody &s;teeps above, which St. Aubert &s;urveyed with an anxious eye. He was already wearied by his walk, and this a&s;cent was formidable to him. He thought, however, it would be le&s;s toil|&s;ome than the long and broken road, and he determined to at|tempt it; but Emily ever watchful of his ea&s;e, propo&s;ing that he &s;hould re&s;t, and dine before they proceeded further, Valancourt went to the carriage for the refre&s;hments depo&s;ited there.</P>
<P>On his return, he propo&s;ed removing a little higher up the mountain, to where the woods opened upon a grand and exten|&s;ive pro&s;pect; and thither they were preparing to go, when they &s;aw a young woman join the children, and care&s;s and weep over them.</P>
<P>The travellers, intere&s;ted by her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;topped to ob&s;erve her. She took the younge&s;t of the children in her arms, and, perceiving the &s;trangers, ha&s;tily dried her tears, and proceeded to the cottage. St. Aubert, on inquiring the occa&s;ion of her &s;orrow,
<PB N="55" REF="029378_0028_0FE07DE4C2D47108">
learned that her hu&s;band, who was a &s;hepherd, and lived here in the &s;ummer months to watch over the flocks he led to feed upon the&s;e mountains, had lo&s;t, on the preceding night, his little all. A gang of gip&s;ies, who had for &s;ometime infe&s;ted the neighbour|hood, had driven away &s;everal of his ma&s;ter's &s;heep. "Jacques," added the &s;hepherd's wife, "had &s;aved a little money, and had bought a few &s;heep with it, and now they mu&s;t go to his ma&s;ter for tho&s;e that are &s;tolen; and what is wor&s;e than all, his ma&s;ter, when he comes to know how it is, will tru&s;t him no longer with the care of his flocks, for he is a hard man! and then what is to become of our children!"</P>
<P>The innocent countenance of the woman, and the &s;implicity of her manner in relating her grievance, inclined St. Aubert to believe her &s;tory; and Valancourt, convinced that it was true, a&s;ked eagerly what was the value of the &s;tolen &s;heep; on hear|ing which, he turned away with a look of di&s;appointment. St. Aubert put &s;ome money into her hand, Emily too gave &s;ome|thing from her little pur&s;e, and they walked towards the cliff; but Valancourt lingered behind, and &s;poke to the &s;hepherd's wife, who was now weeping with gratitude and &s;urpri&s;e. He inquired how much money was yet wanting to replace the &s;tolen &s;heep, and found, that it was a &s;um very little &s;hort of all he had about him. He was perplexed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. "This &s;um then," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "would make this poor family completely hap|py&mdash;it is in my power to give it&mdash;to make them completely happy! But what is to become of me? how &s;hall I contrive to reach home with the little money that will remain?" For a mo|ment he &s;tood, unwilling to forego the luxury of rai&s;ing a family from ruin to happine&s;s, yet con&s;idering the difficulties of pur&s;u|ing his journey with &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as would be left.</P>
<P>While he was in this &s;tate of perplexity, the &s;hepherd him&s;elf appeared: his children ran to meet him; he took one of them in his arms, and, with the other clinging to his coat, came forward with a loitering &s;tep. His forlorn and melancholy look determined Valancourt at once; he threw down all the money he had, except a few louis, and bounded away after St. Aubert and Emily, who were proceeding &s;lowly up the &s;teep. Valancourt had &s;eldom felt his heart &s;o light as at this moment; his gay &s;pirits danced with plea&s;ure; every object around him appeared more intere&s;t|ing, or beautiful, than before. St. Aubert ob&s;erved the uncom|mon vivacity of his countenance: "What has plea&s;ed you &s;o much?" &s;aid he. "O what a lovely day," replied Valancourt, "how brightly the &s;un &s;hines, how pure is this air, what enchant|ing
<PB N="56" REF="029378_0029_0FE07DF1F0936CC0">
&s;cenery!" "It is indeed enchanting," &s;aid St. Aubert, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> early experience had taught to under&s;tand the nature of Valan|court's pre&s;ent feelings. "What pity that the wealthy, who can command &s;uch &s;un&s;hine, &s;hould ever pa&s;s their days i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> gloom&mdash;in the cold &s;hade of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s!

<P>Valancourt, highly flattered by this compliment, could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no reply but by a &s;mile of gratitude.</P>
<P>They continued to wind under the woods, between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> knolls of the mountain, and, as they reached the &s;hady &s;ummit which he had pointed out, the whole party bur&s;t into an excla|mation. Behind the &s;pot where they &s;tood, the rock ro&s;e per|pendicularly in a ma&s;&s;y wall to a con&s;iderable height, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> branched out into overhanging crags. Their grey tints <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well contra&s;ted by the bright hues of the plants and wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that grew in their fractured &s;ides, and were deepened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the gloom of the pines and cedars that waved above.

O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> every &s;ide appeared the maje&s;tic &s;ummits of the Pyrenees, &s;ome exhibiting tremendous crags of marble, who&s;e appearance was changing every in&s;tant, as the varying lights fell upon their &s;ur|face: others, &s;till higher, di&s;playing only &s;nowy points, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> their lower &s;teeps were covered almo&s;t invariably with fore&s;ts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pine, larch, and oak, that &s;tretched down to the vale. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was one of the narrow vallies, that open from the Pyrenees into the country of Rou&s;illon, and who&s;e green pa&s;tures, and cultivat|ed beauty form a decided and wonderful contra&s;t to the roman|tic grandeur that environs it. Through a vi&s;ta of the mountain appeared the lowlands of Rou&s;illon, tinted with the blue haze <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tance, as they united with the waters of the Mediterranean; where, on a promontory, which marked the boundary of the &s;hore, &s;tood a lonely beacon, over which were &s;een circling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ights of &s;eafowl. Beyond, appeared, now and then, a &s;tealing &s;ail, white with the &s;unbeam, and who&s;e progre&s;s was perceiva|ble by its approach to the light-hou&s;e. Sometimes, too, was &s;een a &s;ail &s;o di&s;tant, that it &s;erved only to mark the line of &s;ep|aration between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and the waves.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="029378_0029_0FE07DF1F0936CC0">
On the other &s;ide of the valley, immediately oppo&s;ite to the &s;pot where the travellers re&s;ted, a rocky pa&s;s opened toward Ga&s;cony. Here no &s;ign of cultivation appeared. The rocks of granite, that &s;creened the glen, ro&s;e abruptly from their ba&s;e, and &s;tretched their barren points to the clouds, unvaried with woods, and uncheered even by a hunter's cabin. Sometimes, indeed, a gigantic larch threw its long &s;hade over the precipice, and here and there a cliff reared on its brow a monumental cro&s;s, to tell the traveller the fate of him who had ventured thither before. This &s;pot &s;eemed the very haunt of banditti; and Em|ily, as &s;he looked down upon it, almo&s;t expected to &s;ee them &s;tealing out from &s;ome hollow cave to look for their prey. Soon after an object not le&s;s terrific &s;truck her,&mdash;a gibbet &s;tanding on a point of rock near the entrance of the pa&s;s, and immediately over one of the cro&s;&s;es &s;he had before ob&s;erved. The&s;e were hieroglyphics that told a plain and dreadful &s;tory. She forbore to point it out to St. Aubert, but it threw a gloom over her &s;pi|rits, and made her anxious to ha&s;ten forward, that they might with certainty reach Rou&s;illon before night-fall. It was nece&s;|&s;ary, however, that St. Aubert &s;hould take &s;ome refre&s;hment, and, &s;eating them&s;elves on the &s;hort dry turf, they opened the ba&s;ket of provi&s;ions, while

<P>St. Aubert was revived by re&s;t, and by the &s;erene air of this &s;ummit; and Valancourt was &s;o charmed with all around, and with the conver&s;ation of his companions, that he &s;eemed to have forgotten he had any further to go. Having concluded their &s;imple repa&s;t, they gave a long farewell look to the &s;cene, and again began to a&s;cend. St. Aubert rejoiced when he reached the carriage, which Emily entered with him; but Valancourt, willing to take a more exten&s;ive view of the enchanting country, into which they were about to de&s;cend, than he could do from a carriage, loo&s;ened his dogs, and once more bounded with them along the banks of the road. He often quitted it for points that promi&s;ed a wider pro&s;pect, and the &s;low pace, at which the
<PB N="58" REF="029378_0030_0FE07DF6E086EF50">
mules travelled, allowed him to overtake them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. Whenever a &s;cene of uncommon magnificence appeared, he ha&s;t|ened to inform St. Aubert, who, though he was too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to walk him&s;elf, &s;ometimes made the chai&s;e wait, while Emily went to the neighbouring cliff.</P>
<P>It was evening when they de&s;cended the lower alps, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Rou&s;illon, and form a maje&s;tic barrier round that charming coun|try, leaving it open only on the ea&s;t to the Mediterranean. The gay tints of cultivation once more beautified the land&s;cape; for the lowlands were coloured with the riche&s;t hues, which a luxu|riant climate, and an indu&s;trious people can awaken into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Groves of orange and lemon perfumed the air, their ripe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> growing among the foliage; while, &s;loping to the plains, exten|&s;ive vineyards &s;pread their trea&s;ures. Beyond the&s;e, woods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;tures, and mingled towns and hamlets &s;tretched towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ea, on who&s;e bright &s;urface gleamed many a di&s;tant &s;ail; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over the whole &s;cene, was diffu&s;ed the purple glow of evening. This land&s;cape with the &s;urrounding alps did, indeed, pre&s;ents perfect picture of the lovely and the &s;ublime, of "beauty &s;leep|ing in the lap of horror."</P>
<P>The travellers, having reached the plains, proceeded, between hedges of flowering myrtle and pomegranate, to the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Arles, where they purpo&s;ed to re&s;t for the night. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with &s;imple, but neat accommodation, and would have pa&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> happy evening, after the toils and the delights of this day, had not the approaching &s;eparation thrown a gloom over their &s;pirits. It was St. Aubert's plan to proceed, on the morrow, to the bor|ders of the Mediterranean, and travel along its &s;hores into Lan|guedoc; and Valancourt, &s;ince he was now nearly recovered, and had no longer a pretence for continuing with his new friends, re&s;olved to leave them here. St. Aubert, who was much plea&s;ed with him, invited him to go further, but did not repeat the in|vitation, and Valancourt had re&s;olution enough to forego the temptation of accepting it, that he might prove him&s;elf not un|worthy of the favour. On the following morning, therefore, they were to part, St. Aubert to pur&s;ue his way to Languedoc, and Valancourt to explore new &s;cenes among the mountains, on his return home. During this evening he was often &s;ilent and thoughtful; St. Aubert's manner towards him was affectionate, though grave, and Emily was &s;erious, though &s;he made frequent efforts to appear cheerful. After one of the mo&s;t melancholy evenings they had yet pa&s;&s;ed together, they &s;eparated for the night.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the morning, Valancourt breakfa&s;ted with St. Aubert and Emily, neither of whom &s;eemed much refre&s;hed by &s;leep. The languor of illne&s;s &s;till hung over St. Aubert, and to Emily's fears his di&s;order appeared to be increa&s;ing fa&s;t upon him. She watch|ed his looks with anxious affection, and their expre&s;&s;ion was always faithfully reflected in her own.</P>
<P>At the commencement of their acquaintance, Valancourt had made known his name and family. St. Aubert was not a &s;tran|ger to either, for the family e&s;tates, which were now in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of an elder brother of Valancourt, were little more than twenty miles di&s;tant from La Vallee, and he had &s;ometimes met the elder Valancourt on vi&s;its in the neighbourhood. This knowledge had made him more willingly receive his pre&s;ent companion; for, though his countenance and manners would have won him the acquaintance of St. Aubert, who was very apt to tru&s;t to the intelligence of his own eyes, with re&s;pect to coun|tenances, he would not have accepted the&s;e, as &s;ufficient intro|ductions to that of his daughter.</P>
<P>The breakfa&s;t was almo&s;t as &s;ilent as the &s;upper of the preced|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight; but their mu&s;ing was at length interrupted by the &s;ound of the carriage-wheels, which were to bear away St. Au|bert and Emily. Valancourt &s;tarted from his chair, and went to the window; it was indeed the carriage, and he returned to his &s;eat without &s;peaking. The moment was now come when they mu&s;t part. St. Aubert told Valancourt, that he hoped he would never pa&s;s La Vallee without favouring him with a vi&s;it; and Valancourt, eagerly thanking him, a&s;&s;ured him that he never would; as he &s;aid which he looked timidly at Emily, who tried to &s;mile away the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of her &s;pirits. They pa&s;&s;ed a few minutes in intere&s;ting conver&s;ation, and St. Aubert then led the
<PB N="60" REF="029378_0031_0FE07E02171B2558">
way to the carriage, Emily and Valancourt following in &s;ilence. The latter lingered at the door &s;everal minutes after they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eated, and none of the party &s;eemed to have courage enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay&mdash;Farewell. At length, St. Aubert pronounced the melan|choly word, which Emily pa&s;&s;ed to Valancourt, who returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with a dejected &s;mile, and the carriage drove on.</P>
<P>The travellers remained, for &s;ometime, in a &s;tate of tranq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> pen&s;ivene&s;s, which is not unplea&s;ing.

<P>"Ah, my Emily!" replied St. Aubert, "for thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Well&mdash;I hope it is &s;o."

<P>Emily, who pre&s;&s;ed her father's hand affectionately, had never before li&s;tened with &s;o much plea&s;ure to the prai&s;es he be&s;towed; no, not even when he had be&s;towed them on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>They travelled on, among vineyards, woods and pa&s;tures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lighted with the romantic beauty of the land&s;cape, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bounded on one &s;ide, by the grandeur of the Pyrenees, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the other, by the ocean; and, &s;oon after noon, they reached the town of Colioure, &s;ituated on the Mediterranean.

<P>St. Aubert was impatient to reach Perpignan, where he ex|pected letters from M. Que&s;nel; and it was the expectation of the&s;e letters, that had induced him to leave Colioure, for his feeble frame had required immediate re&s;t. After travelling a few miles, he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll a&s;leep; and Emily, who had put two or three b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the carriage, on leaving La Vallee, had now the lei&s;ure for looking into them. She &s;ought for one, in which Valancourt had been reading the day before, and hoped for the plea&s;ure of retracing a page, over which the eyes of a beloved friend had lately pa&s;&s;ed, of dwelling on the pa&s;&s;ages, which he had admired, and of permitting them to &s;peak to her in the lan|guage of his own mind, and to bring him&s;elf to her pre&s;ence. On &s;earching for the book, &s;he could find it no where, but in its &s;tead perceived a volume of Petrarch's poems, that had belonged to Valancourt, who&s;e name was written in it, and from which he had frequently read pa&s;&s;ages to her, with all the pathetic expre&s;|&s;ion, that characterized the feelings of the author. She he&s;ita|ted in believing, what would have been &s;ufficiently apparent to almo&s;t any other per&s;on, that he had purpo&s;ely left this book, in&s;tead of the one &s;he had lo&s;t, and that love had prompted the exchange; but, having opened it with impatient plea&s;ure, and ob&s;erved the lines of his pencil drawn along the various pa&s;&s;ages he had read aloud, and under others more de&s;criptive of delicate tenderne&s;s than he had dared to tru&s;t his voice with, the con|viction came, at length, to her mind. For &s;ome moments &s;he was con&s;cious only of being beloved; then, a recollection of all the variations of tone and countenance, with which he had recit|ed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and of the &s;oul, which &s;poke in their expre&s;&s;ion, pre&s;&s;ed to her memory, and &s;he wept over the memorial of his affection.</P>
<P>They arrived at Perpignan &s;oon after &s;un&s;et, where St. Aubert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, as he had expected, letters from M. Que&s;nel, the contents of which &s;o evidently and grievou&s;ly affected him, that Emily was alarmed, and pre&s;&s;ed him, as far as her delicacy would per|mit, to di&s;clo&s;e the occa&s;ion of his concern; but he an&s;wered her only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and immediately began to talk on other topics.&mdash;Emily, though &s;he forbore to pre&s;s the one mo&s;t intere&s;ting to her, was greatly affected by her father's manner, and pa&s;&s;ed a night of &s;leeple&s;s &s;olicitude.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="029378_0032_0FE07E07D0546F68">
In the morning they pur&s;ued their journey along the coa&s;t to|wards Leucate, another town on the Mediterranean, &s;ituated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the borders of Languedoc and Rou&s;illon. On the way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> renewed the &s;ubject of the preceding night, and appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deeply affected by St. Aubert's &s;ilence and dejection, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> relaxed from his re&s;erve.

<P>St. Aubert pau&s;ed, to conceal his emotion.</P>
<P>"The letters I have ju&s;t received from M. Que&s;nel," re&s;um<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he, &s;truggling to &s;peak with firmne&s;s, "enclo&s;ed others from Motteville, which confirmed all I dreaded."</P>
<P>"Mu&s;t we then quit La Vallee?" &s;aid Emily, after a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pau&s;e of &s;ilence. "That is yet uncertain," replied St. Aubert "it will depend upon the compromi&s;e Motteville is able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with his creditors. My income, you know, was never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and now it will be reduced to little indeed! It is for you, Emily for you, my child, that I am mo&s;t afflicted." His la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> faltered; Emily &s;miled tenderly upon him through her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and then, endeavouring to overcome her emotion, "My dear father," &s;aid &s;he, "do not grieve for me, or for your&s;elf; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> may yet be happy;&mdash;if La Vallee remains for us, we mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> happy.

<P>St. Aubert concealed his face with his handkerchief, and was unable to &s;peak; but Emily continued to urge to her father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> truths, which him&s;elf had impre&s;&s;ed upon her mind.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="029378_0032_0FE07E07D0546F68">
"Be&s;ides, my dear &s;ir, poverty cannot deprive us of intellectual delights.

<P>St. Aubert could not reply: he caught Emily to his bo&s;om, their tears flowed together, but&mdash;they were not tears of &s;orrow. After this language of the heart, all other would have been fee|ble, and they remained &s;ilent for &s;ometime. Then, St. Aubert conver&s;ed as before; for, if his mind had not recovered its na|tural tranquillity, it at lea&s;t a&s;&s;umed the appearance of it.</P>
<P>They reached the romantic town of Leucate early in the day, but St. Aubert was weary, and they determined to pa&s;s the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight there. In the evening, he exerted him&s;elf &s;o far as to walk with his daughter to view the environs that overlooked the lake of Leucate, the Mediterranean, part of Rou&s;illon, with the Pyrenees, and a wide extent of the luxuriant province of Languedoc, now blu&s;hing with the ripened vintage, which the pea&s;ants were beginning to gather. St. Aubert and Emily &s;aw the bu&s;y groups, caught the joyous &s;ong, that was wafted on the breeze, and anticipated, with apparent plea&s;ure, their next day's journey over this gay region. He de&s;igned, however, &s;till to wind along the &s;ea-&s;hore. To return home immediately was partly his wi&s;h, but from this he was with-held by a de&s;ire to lengthen the plea&s;ure, which the journey gave his daughter, and to try the effect of the &s;ea air on his own di&s;order.</P>
<P>On the following day, therefore, they recommenced their journey through Languedoc, winding the &s;hores of the Medi|terranean; the Pyrenees &s;till forming the magnificent back|ground of their pro&s;pects, while on their right was the ocean, and, on their left, wide extended plains melting into the blue horizon. St. Aubert was plea&s;ed, and conver&s;ed much with Emily, yet his cheerfulne&s;s was &s;ometimes artificial, and &s;ome|times a &s;hade of melancholy would &s;teal upon his countenance, and betray him. This was &s;oon cha&s;ed away by Emily's &s;mile; who &s;miled, however, with an aching heart, for &s;he &s;aw that his misfortunes preyed upon his mind, and upon his enfeebled frame.</P>

It was evening when they reached a &s;mall village-of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Languedoc, where they meant to pa&s;s the night, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could not afford them beds; for here, too, it was the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> the vintage, and they were obliged to proceed to the next <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>The intelligent eyes of Emily &s;eemed to read what pa&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the mind of her father, and &s;he fixed them on his face, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> expre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch tender pity, as recalled his thoughts from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;ultory object of regret, and he remembered only, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t leave his daughter without protection.

He replied, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> miles. "I feel I am unable to proceed much further," &s;aid St. Aubert; "inquire, as you go, if there is any hou&s;e on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> road that would accommodate us for the night."

&s;et off, and continued on the full gallop, till St. Aubert, almo&s;t fainting, called to him to &s;top. Emily looked anxiou&s;ly from the window, and &s;aw a pea&s;ant walking at &s;ome little di&s;tance on the road, for whom they waited, till he came up, when he was a&s;ked, if there was any hou&s;e in the neighbourhood that accom|modated travellers. He replied, that he knew of none. "There is a chateau, indeed, among tho&s;e woods on the right," added he, "but I believe it receives nobody, and I cannot &s;hew you the way, for I am almo&s;t a &s;tranger here." St. Aubert was go|ing to a&s;k him &s;ome further que&s;tion concerning the chateau, but the man abruptly pa&s;&s;ed on. After &s;ome con&s;ideration, he ordered Michael to proceed &s;lowly to the woods. Every mo|ment now deepened the twilight, and increa&s;ed the difficulty of finding the road. Another pea&s;ant &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;"Which is the way to the chateau in the woods?" cried Mi|chael.</P>
<P>"The chateau in the woods!" exclaimed the pea&s;ant, "Do you mean that with the turret yonder?"</P>
<P>"I don't know as for the turret, as you call it," &s;aid Michael, "I mean that white piece of a building, that we &s;ee at a di&s;tance there, among the trees."</P>
<P>"Yes, that is the turret; why, who are you, that you are going thither?" &s;aid the man with &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, on hearing this odd que&s;tion, and ob&s;erving the peculiar tone in which it was delivered, looked out from the carriage. "We are travellers," &s;aid he, "who are in &s;earch of a hou&s;e of accommodation for the night; is there any hereabout?"</P>
<P>"None, Mon&s;ieur, unle&s;s you have a mind to try your luck yonder," replied the pea&s;ant, pointing to the woods, "but I would not advi&s;e you to go there."</P>
<P>"To whom does the chateau belong?"</P>
<P>"I &s;carcely know my&s;elf, Mon&s;ieur,"</P>
<P>"It is uninhabited, them," "No, not uninhabited; the &s;tew|ard and hou&s;ekeeper are there, I believe."</P>
<P>On hearing this, St. Aubert determined to proceed to the chateau, and ri&s;que the refu&s;al of being accommodated for the night; he therefore de&s;ired the countryman would &s;hew Michael the way, and bade him expect reward for his trouble. The man was for a moment &s;ilent, and then &s;aid, that he was going on other bu&s;ine&s;s, but that the road could not be mi&s;&s;ed, if they went up an avenue to the right, to which he pointed. St. Au|bert was going to &s;peak, but the pea&s;ant wi&s;hed him good night, and walked on.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="029378_0034_0FE07E1BED82E100">
The carriage now moved towards the avenue, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> guarded by a gate, and Michael having di&s;mounted to open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> they entered between rows of ancient oak and che&s;nut, who&s;e in|termingled branches formed a lofty arch above. There was &s;omething &s;o gloomy and de&s;olate in the appearance of this ave|nue, and its lonely &s;ilence, that Emily almo&s;t &s;huddered as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;&s;ed along; and recollecting the manner in which the pea&s;ant had mentioned the chateau, &s;he gave a my&s;terious meaning to his words, &s;uch as &s;he had not &s;u&s;pected when he uttered them. The&s;e apprehen&s;ions, however, &s;he tried to check, con&s;idering that they were probably the effect of a melancholy imagination which her father's &s;ituation, and a con&s;ideration of her own cir|cum&s;tances, had made &s;en&s;ible to every impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly on, for they were now almo&s;t in darkne&s;s, which, together with the unevenne&s;s of the ground, and the fre|quent roots of old trees, that &s;hot up above the &s;oil, made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to proceed with caution. On a &s;udden Michael &s;topped the carriage; and, as St. Aubert looked from the window <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> inquire the cau&s;e, he perceived a figure at &s;ome di&s;tance moving up the avenue. The du&s;k would not permit him to di&s;tingui&s;h what it was, but he bade Michael go on.</P>
<P>"This &s;eems a &s;trange wild place," &s;aid Michael; "there is no hou&s;e hereabout, don't your honour think we had better turn back?"</P>
<P>"Go a little further, and if we &s;ee no hou&s;e then, we will return to the road," replied St. Aubert.</P>
<P>Michael proceeded with reluctance, and the extreme &s;low|ne&s;s of his pace made St. Aubert look again from the window to ha&s;ten him, when again he &s;aw the &s;ame figure. He was &s;omewhat &s;tartled: probably the gloomine&s;s of the &s;pot made him more liable to alarm than u&s;ual; however this might be, he now &s;topped Michael, and bade him call to the per&s;on in the avenue.</P>
<P>"Plea&s;e your honour, he may be a robber," &s;aid Michael "It does not plea&s;e me," replied St. Aubert, who could not for|bear &s;miling at the &s;implicity of his phra&s;e, "and we will, therefore, return to the road, for I &s;ee no probability of meeting here with what we &s;eek."</P>
<P>Michael turned about immediately, and was retracing his way with alacrity, when a voice was heard from among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the left. It was not the voice of command or di&s;tre&s;s, but a deep hallow tone, which &s;eemed to be &s;carcely human. The man whipped his mules till they went as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, regard|le&s;s

<P>"I am very ill," &s;aid St. Aubert, taking his daughter's hand. "You are wor&s;e then, &s;ir!" &s;aid Emily extremely alarmed by his manner, "you are wor&s;e, and here is no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Good God! what is to be done!" He leaned his head on her &s;houl|der, while &s;he endeavoured to &s;upport him with her arm, and Michael was again ordered to &s;top. When the rattling of the wheels had cea&s;ed, mu&s;ic was heard on the air; it was to Emily the voice of Hope. "Oh! we are near &s;ome human habita|tion!" &s;aid &s;he, "help may &s;oon be had."</P>
<P>She li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly; the &s;ounds were di&s;tant, and &s;eemed to come from a remote part of the woods that bordered the road; and, as &s;he looked towards the &s;pot whence they i&s;&s;ued, &s;he per|ceived in the faint moonlight &s;omething like a chateau. It was difficult, however, to reach this; St. Aubert was now too ill to bear the motion of the carriage; Michael could not quit his mules; and Emily, who &s;till &s;upported her father, feared to leave him, and al&s;o feared to venture alone to &s;uch a di&s;tance, &s;he knew not whither, or to whom. Something, however it was nece&s;&s;ary to determine upon immediately; St. Aubert there|fore told Michael to proceed &s;lowly; but they had not gone far, when he fainted, and the carriage was again &s;topped. He lay quite &s;en&s;ele&s;s.&mdash;"My dear, dear father," cried Emily in great agony, and who began to fear that he was dying, "&s;peak, if it is only one word to let me hear the &s;ound of your voice!" But no voice &s;poke in reply. In an agony of terror &s;he bade Mi|chael bring water from the rivulet, that flowed along the road; and, having received &s;ome in the man's hat, with trembling hands &s;he &s;prinkled it over her father's face, which as the moon's rays now fell upon it, &s;eemed to bear the impre&s;&s;ion of death. Every emotion of &s;elfi&s;h fear now gave way to a &s;tronger influ|ence, and committing St. Aubert to the care of Michael, who re|fu&s;ed to go far from his mules, &s;he &s;tepped from the carriage in &s;earch of the chateau &s;he had &s;een at a di&s;tance. It was a &s;till moonlight night, and the mu&s;ic which yet &s;ounded on the air, di|rected her &s;teps from the high road, up a &s;hadowy lane that led to the woods. Her mind was for &s;ometime &s;o entirely occupi|ed by anxiety and terror for her father, that &s;he felt none for her&s;elf, till the deepening gloom of the overhanging foliage, which now wholly excluded the moonlight, and the wildne&s;s of the
<PB N="68" REF="029378_0035_0FE07E28DF1D9B50">
place, recalled her to a &s;en&s;e of her adventurous &s;ituation. The mu&s;ic had cea&s;ed, and &s;he had no guide but chance. For a mo|ment &s;he pau&s;ed in terrified perplexity, till a &s;en&s;e of her fa|ther's condition again overcoming every con&s;ideration for her&s;elf, &s;he proceeded. The lane terminated in the woods, but &s;he look|ed round in vain for a hou&s;e, or a human being, and as vainly li&s;tened for a &s;ound to guide her. She hurried on, however, not knowing whither, avoiding the rece&s;&s;es of the woods, and endea|vouring to keep along their margin, till a rude kind of avenue which opened upon a moonlight &s;pot arre&s;ted her attention. The wildne&s;s of this avenue brought to her recollection the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> leading to the turreted chateau, and &s;he was inclined to believe, that this was a part of the &s;ame domain, and probably led to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ame point. While &s;he he&s;itated whether, to follow it or not, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ound of many voices in loud merriment bur&s;t upon her ear. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eemed not the laugh of cheerfulne&s;s, but of riot, and &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appalled. While &s;he pau&s;ed, &s;he heard a di&s;tant voice, calling from the way &s;he had come, and, not doubting but it was that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Michael, her fir&s;t impul&s;e was to ha&s;ten back; but a &s;econd thought changed her purpo&s;e; &s;he believed that nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than the la&s;t extremity could have prevailed with Michael <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quit his mules, and fearing that her father was now dying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ru&s;hed forward, with a feeble hope of obtaining a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the people in the woods. Her heart beat with fearful expecta|tion, as &s;he drew near the &s;pot whence the voices i&s;&s;ued, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> often &s;tartled, when her &s;teps di&s;turbed the fallen leaves. The &s;ounds led her towards the moonlight glade &s;he had before noti|ced; at a little di&s;tance from which &s;he &s;topped, and &s;aw, be|tween the boles of the trees, a &s;mall circular level of green turf, &s;urrounded by the woods, on which appeared a group of figures. On drawing nearer, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the&s;e, by their dre&s;s, to be pea&s;ants, and perceived &s;everal cottages &s;cattered round the edge of the woods, which waved loftily over this &s;pot. While &s;he gazed, and endeavoured to overcome the apprehen&s;ions that with|held her &s;teps, &s;everal pea&s;ant girls came out of a cottage; mu&s;ic in&s;tantly &s;truck up, and the dance began. It was the joyous mu|&s;ic of the vintage! the &s;ame &s;he had before heard upon the air. Her heart occupied with terror for her father, could not feel the contra&s;t which this gay &s;cene offered to her own di&s;tre&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tepped ha&s;tily forward towards a group of elder pea&s;ants who were &s;eated at the door of a cottage, and, having explained her &s;ituation, entreated their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

who &s;eemed to move on the wind, as fa&s;t as they could to|wards the road.</P>
<P>When &s;he reached the carriage, &s;he found St. Aubert re&s;tored to animation. On the recovery of his &s;en&s;es, having heard from Michael whither his daughter was gone, anxiety for her over|came every regard for him&s;elf, and he had &s;ent him in &s;earch of her. He was, however, &s;till languid, and, perceiving him&s;elf unable to travel much further, he renewed his inquiries for an inn, and concerning the chateau in the woods. "The chateau can|not accommodate you, &s;ir," &s;aid a venerable pea&s;ant who had followed Emily from the woods, "it is &s;carcely inhabited; but, if you will do me the honour to vi&s;it my cottage, you &s;hall be welcome to the be&s;t bed it affords."</P>
<P>St. Aubert was him&s;elf a Frenchman; he, therefore, was not &s;urpri&s;ed at French courte&s;y; but, ill as he was, he felt the value of the offer enhanced by the manner which accompanied it. He had too much delicacy to apologize, or to appear to he&s;itate about availing him&s;elf of the pea&s;ant's ho&s;pitality, but immedi|ately accepted it with the &s;ame frankne&s;s with which it was offered.</P>
<P>The carriage again moved &s;lowly on; Michael following the pea&s;ants up the lane, which Emily had ju&s;t quitted, till they came to the moonlight glade. St. Aubert's &s;pirits were &s;o far re&s;tored by the courte&s;y of his ho&s;t, and the near pro&s;pect of repo&s;e, that he looked with a &s;weet complacency upon the moonlight &s;cene, &s;urrounded by the &s;hadowy woods, through which, here and there, an opening admitted the &s;treaming &s;plendour, di&s;covering a cottage, or a &s;parkling rivulet. He li&s;tened, with no painful emotion, to the merry notes of the guitar and tamborine; and, though tears came to his eyes, when he &s;aw the <HI>debonnaire</HI> dance of the pea&s;ants, they were not merely tears of mournful regret. With Emily it was otherwi&s;e; immediate terror for her father had now &s;ub&s;ided into a gentle melancholy, which every note of joy, by awakening compari&s;on, &s;erved to heighten.</P>
<P>The dance cea&s;ed on the approach of the carriage, which was a phenomenon in the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered woods, and the pea&s;antry flocked round it with eager curio&s;ity. On learning that it brought a &s;ick &s;tranger, &s;everal girls ran acro&s;s the turf, and re|turned with wine and ba&s;kets of grapes, which they pre&s;ented to the travellers, each with kind contention, pre&s;&s;ing for a prefer|ence. At length the carriage &s;topped at a neat cottage, and his venerable conductor, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted St. Aubert to alight, led him and Emily to a &s;mall inner room, illuminated only by moon|beams, which the open ca&s;ement admitted. St. Aubert, rejoic|ing
<PB N="70" REF="029378_0036_0FE07E2D7763D328">
in re&s;t, &s;eated him&s;elf in an armchair, and his &s;en&s;es were re|fre&s;hed by the cool and balmy air, that lightly waved the em|bowering honey&s;uckles, and wafted their &s;weet breath into the apartment. His ho&s;t, who was called La Voi&s;in, quitted the room, but &s;oon returned with fruits, cream, and all the pa&s;toral luxury his cottage afforded; having &s;et down which, with a &s;mile of unfeigned welcome, he retired behind the chair of his gue&s;t. St. Aubert in&s;i&s;ted on his taking a &s;eat at the table, and, when the fruit had allayed the fever of his palate, and he found him&s;elf &s;omewhat revived, he began to conver&s;e with his ho&s;t, who communicated &s;everal particulars concerning him&s;elf and his family, which were intere&s;ting, becau&s;e they were &s;poke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the heart, and delineated a picture of the &s;weet courte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of family kindne&s;s. Emily &s;at by her father, holding his hand, and, while &s;he li&s;tened to the old man, her heart &s;welled with the affectionate &s;ympathy he de&s;cribed, and her tears fell to the mournful con&s;ideration, that death would probably &s;oon deprive her of the deare&s;t ble&s;&s;ing &s;he then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The &s;oft moonlight of an autumnal evening, and the di&s;tant mu&s;ic, which now &s;ound|ed a plaintive &s;train, aided the melancholy of her mind. The old man continued to talk of his family, and St. Aubert remain|ed &s;ilent. "I have only one daughter living," &s;aid La Voi&s;in, "but &s;he is happily married, and is every thing to me. What I lo&s;t my wife," he added with a &s;igh, "I came to live with Agnes, and her family; &s;he has &s;everal children, who are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dancing on the green yonder, as merry as gra&s;shoppers&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> long may they be &s;o! I hope to die among them, mon&s;ieur. I am old now, and cannot expect to live long, but there is &s;ome comfort in dying &s;urrounded by one's children."</P>
<P>"My good friend," &s;aid St. Aubert, while his voice trem|bled, "I hope you will long live &s;urrounded by them."</P>
<P>"Ah, &s;ir! at my age I mu&s;t not expect that!" replied the old man, and he pau&s;ed: "I can &s;carcely wi&s;h it," he re&s;umed, "for I tru&s;t that whenever I die, I &s;hall go to heaven, where my poor wife is gone before me. I can &s;ometimes almo&s;t fancy I &s;ee her of a &s;till moonlight night walking among the&s;e &s;hades &s;he loved &s;o well. Do you believe, mon&s;ieur, that we &s;hall be permitted to revi&s;it the earth after we have quitted the body?"</P>
<P>Emily could no longer &s;tifle the angui&s;h of her heart; her tears fell fa&s;t upon her father's hand, which &s;he yet held. He made an effort to &s;peak, and at length &s;aid in a low voice, "I hope we &s;hall be permitted to look down on tho&s;e we have left on the earth, but I can only hope it. Futurity is much veiled from
<PB N="71" REF="029378_0036_0FE07E2D7763D328">
our eyes, and faith and hope are our only guides concerning it. We are not enjoined to believe, that di&s;embodied &s;pirits watch over the friends they have loved, but we may innocently hope it. It as a hope which I will never re&s;ign," continued he, while he wiped the tears from his daughter's eyes, "it will &s;weeten the bitter moments of death!" Tears fell &s;lowly on his cheeks; La Voi&s;in, wept too, and there was a pau&s;e of &s;ilence. Then, La Voi&s;in, renewing the &s;ubject, &s;aid, "But you believe, &s;ir, that we &s;hall meet in another world the relations we have loved in this; I mu&s;t believe this." "Then do believe it," replied St. Aubert, "&s;evere, indeed, would be the pangs of &s;eparation, if we believed it to be eternal. Look up, my dear Emily, we &s;hall meet again!" He lifted his eyes towards heaven, and a gleam of moonlight, which fell upon his countenance, di&s;covered peace and re&s;igna|tion, &s;tealing on the lines of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>La Voi&s;in felt that he had pur&s;ued the &s;ubject too far, and he dropped it, &s;aying, "We are in darkne&s;s, I forgot to bring a light."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid St. Aubert, "this is a light I love. Sit down, my good friend. Emily, my love, I find my&s;elf better than I have been all day; this air refre&s;hes me. I can enjoy this tran|quil hour, and that mu&s;ic, which floats &s;o &s;weetly at a di&s;tance. Let me &s;ee you &s;mile. Who touches that guitar &s;o ta&s;tefully? are there two in&s;truments, or is it an echo I hear?"</P>
<P>"It is an echo, mon&s;ieur, I fancy. That guitar is often heard at night, when all is &s;till, but nobody knows who touches it, and it is &s;ometimes accompanied by a voice &s;o &s;weet, and &s;o &s;ad, one would almo&s;t think the woods were haunted." "They cer|tainly are haunted," &s;aid St. Aubert, with a &s;mile, "but I believe it is by mortals." "I have &s;ometimes heard it at midnight, when I could not &s;leep," rejoined La Voi&s;in, not &s;eeming to no|tice this remark, "almo&s;t under my window, and I never heard any mu&s;ic like it. It has often made me think of my poor wife till I cried. I have &s;ometimes got up to the window to look if I could &s;ee any body, but as &s;oon as I opened the ca&s;ement all was hu&s;hed, and nobody to be &s;een; and I have li&s;tened, and li&s;tened till I have been &s;o timorous, that even the trembling of the leaves in the breeze has made me &s;tart. "They &s;ay it often comes to warn people of their death, but I have heard it the&s;e many years, and outlived the warning."</P>
<P>Emily, though &s;he &s;miled at the mention of this ridiculous &s;uper&s;tition, could not, in the pre&s;ent tone of her &s;pirits, wholly re&s;i&s;t its contagion.</P>

<P>Tears &s;tood in St. Aubert's eyes; "Enough" &s;aid he, in a voice almo&s;t &s;tifled by the violence of his emotions,&mdash;"it is enough, my friend."</P>
<P>Emily though extremely &s;urpri&s;ed by her father's manner, for|bore to expre&s;s her feelings by any que&s;tion.

After a long pau&s;e.

<P>Emily, on hearing this, &s;hrunk with a &s;uper&s;titious dread en|tirely new to her, and could &s;carcely conceal her agitation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> St. Aubert.</P>
<P>"But the boy lived, mon&s;ieur, in &s;pite of father Denis."</P>

<P>"Yes &s;ir, the convent of St. Clair &s;tands at no great di&s;tance on the &s;ea &s;hore yonder."</P>

"But, my dear &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, anxious to di&s;&s;ipate his thoughts, "you forget that repo&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to you. If our kind ho&s;t will give me leave I will prepare your bed, for I know how you like it to be made." St. Aubert, recollecting him&s;elf, and &s;miling affectionately, de&s;ired &s;he would not add to her fa|tigue by that attention; and La Voi&s;in, who&s;e con&s;ideration for his gue&s;t had been &s;u&s;pended by the intere&s;ts, which his own narrative had recalled, now &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and, apologiz|ing for not having called Agnes from the green, hurried out of the room.</P>
<P>In a few moments he returned with his daughter, a young woman of a plea&s;ing countenance, and Emily learned from her, what &s;he had not before &s;u&s;pected, that, for their accommodation, it was nece&s;&s;ary part of La Voi&s;in's family &s;hould leave their beds; &s;he lamented this circum&s;tance, but Agnes, by her reply, fully proved that &s;he inherited, at lea&s;t, a &s;hare of her father's courteous ho&s;pitality. It was &s;ettled, that &s;ome of her children and Michael &s;hould &s;leep in the neighbouring cottage.</P>
<P>"If I am better, to-morrow, my dear," &s;aid St. Aubert when Emily returned to him, "I mean to &s;et out at an early hour, that we may re&s;t, during the heat of the day, and will travel towards home. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my health and &s;pirits, I cannot look on a longer journey with plea&s;ure, and I am al&s;o very anx|ious to reach La Vallee." Emily, though &s;he al&s;o de&s;ired to re|turn, was grieved at her father's &s;udden wi&s;h to do &s;o, which &s;he thought indicated a greater degree of indi&s;po&s;ition than he would acknowledge. St. Aubert now retired to re&s;t, and Emily to her little chamber, but not to immediate repo&s;e. Her thoughts returned to the late conver&s;ation, concerning the &s;tate of de|parted &s;pirits; a &s;ubject, at this time, particularly affecting to her, when &s;he had every rea&s;on to believe, that her dear father would ere long be numbered with them. She leaned pen&s;ively on the little open ca&s;ement, and in deep thought fixed her eyes on the heaven, who&s;e blue unclouded concave was &s;tudded thick with &s;tars, the worlds, perhaps, of &s;pirits, un&s;phered of mortal mould. As her eyes wandered along the boundle&s;s aether, her thoughts ro&s;e, as before, towards the &s;ublimity of the Deity, and to the contemplation of futurity. No bu&s;y note of this world interrupted the cour&s;e of her mind; the merry dance had cea&s;ed, and every cottager had retired to his home. The &s;till air &s;eem|ed &s;carcely to breathe upon the woods, and, now and then, the di&s;tant &s;ound of a &s;olitary &s;heep-bell, or of a clo&s;ing ca&s;ement, was all that broke on &s;ilence. At length, even this hint of hu|man

She, then recollected what he had &s;aid concerning this plannet, and the my&s;terious mu&s;ic; and, as &s;he lingered at the window, half hoping and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fearing that it would return, her mind was led to the remem|brance of the extreme emotion her father had &s;hewn on menti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the Marquis La Villeroi's death, and of the fate of the Mar|chione&s;s, and &s;he felt &s;trongly intere&s;ted concerning the remote cau&s;e of this emotion.

<P>No mu&s;ic, however, &s;tole on the &s;ilence of the night, and Emily, perceiving the latene&s;s of the hour, returned to a &s;cene of fatigue, remembered that &s;he was to ri&s;e early in the morning, and withdrew from the window to repo&s;e.</P>

<P>Emily now heard per&s;ons moving below in the cottage, and pre&s;ently the voice of Michael, who was talking to his mules, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led them forth from a hut adjoining. As &s;he left her room, St. Aubert, who was now ri&s;en, met her at the door, apparently as little re&s;tored by &s;leep as her&s;elf. She led him down &s;tairs to the little parlour, in which they had &s;upped on the preceding night, where they found a neat breakfa&s;t &s;et out, while the ho&s;t and his daughter waited to bid them good morrow.</P>
<P>"I envy you this cottage, my good friends," &s;aid St. Aubert, as he met them, it is &s;o plea&s;ant, &s;o quiet, and &s;o neat; and
<PB N="78" REF="029378_0040_0FE07E527550AA98">
this air, that one breathes&mdash;if any thing could re&s;tore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> health, it would &s;urely be this air."</P>
<P>La Voi&s;in bowed gratefully, and replied, with the gallantry of a Frenchman, "Our cottage may be envied, &s;ir, &s;ince you and Mademoi&s;elle have honoured it with your pre&s;ence," St. Aubert gave him a friendly &s;mile for his compliment, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> down to a table, &s;pread with cream, fruit, new chee&s;e, butter, and coffee. Emily, who had ob&s;erved her father with attention, and thought he looked very ill, endeavoured to per&s;uade him to defer travelling till the afternoon; but he &s;eemed very anxious to be at home, and his anxiety he expre&s;&s;ed repeatedly, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> an earne&s;tne&s;s that was unu&s;ual with him. He now &s;aid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> found him&s;elf as well as he had been of late, and that he could bear travelling better in the cool hour of the morning, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> any other time. But, while he was talking with his venerable ho&s;t, and thanking him for his kind attentions, Emily ob&s;erved his countenance change, and, before &s;he could reach him, he fell back in his chair. In a few moments he recovered from the &s;udden faintne&s;s that had come over him, but felt &s;o ill, that he perceived him&s;elf unable to &s;et out, and, having remained a little while, &s;truggling again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of indi&s;po&s;ition, he begged he might be helped up &s;tairs to bed. This reque&s;t re|newed all the terror which Emily had &s;uffered on the pre|ceding evening; but, though &s;carcely able to &s;upport her&s;elf, under the &s;udden &s;hock it gave her, &s;he tried to conceal her ap|prehen&s;ions from St. Aubert, and gave her trembling arm to a&s;|&s;i&s;t him to the door of his chamber.</P>
<P>When he was once more in bed, he de&s;ired that Emily who was then weeping in her own room, might be called; and, as &s;he came, he waved his hand for every other per&s;on to quit the apartment. When they were alone, he held out his hand to her, and fixed his eyes upon her countenance, with an expre&s;&s;ion &s;o full of ten|derne&s;s and grief, that all her fortitude for&s;ook her, and &s;he bur&s;t into an agony of tears. St. Aubert &s;eemed &s;truggling to acquire firmne&s;s, but was &s;till unable to &s;peak; he could only pre&s;s her hand, and check the tears that &s;tood trembling in his eyes. At length, he commanded his voice, "My dear child," &s;aid he, trying to &s;mile through his angui&s;h, "my dear Emily," and pau&s;ed again. He rai&s;ed his eyes to heaven, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prayer, and then, in a firmer tone, and with a look, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the tenderne&s;s of the father was dignified by the pious &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;aint, he &s;aid, "My dear child, I would &s;often the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> truth I have to tell you, but I find my&s;elf quite unequal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="79" REF="029378_0040_0FE07E527550AA98">
the art. Alas! I would at this moment conceal it from you, but that it would be mo&s;t cruel to deceive you. It cannot be long before we mu&s;t part; let us talk of it, that our thoughts and our prayers may prepare us to bear it." His voice faltered, while Emily, &s;till weeping, pre&s;&s;ed his hand clo&s;e to her heart, which &s;welled with a convul&s;ive &s;igh, but &s;he could not look up.</P>
<P>"Let me not wa&s;te the&s;e moments." &s;aid St. Aubert, recov|ering him&s;elf. "I have much to &s;ay. There is a circum&s;tance of &s;olemn con&s;equence, which I have to mention, and a &s;olemn promi&s;e to obtain from you; when this is done I &s;hall be ea&s;ier. You have ob&s;erved, my dear, how anxious I am to reach home, but know not all my rea&s;ons for this. Li&s;ten to what I am going to &s;ay. Yet &s;tay&mdash;before I &s;ay more give me this promi&s;e, a promi&s;e made to your dying father!"&mdash;St. Aubert was interrupted; Emily, &s;truck by his la&s;t words, as if for the fir&s;t time, with a conviction of his immediate danger, rai&s;ed her head; her tears &s;topped, and gazing at him for a moment with an expre&s;&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> angui&s;h, a flight convul&s;ion &s;eized her, and &s;he &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s in her chair. St. Aubert's cries brought La Voi&s;in and his daughter to the room, and they admini&s;tered every means in their power to re&s;tore her, but, for a con&s;iderable time, without effect. When &s;he recovered, St. Aubert was &s;o exhau&s;ted by the &s;cene he had witne&s;&s;ed, that it was many minutes before he had &s;trength to &s;peak; he was, however, &s;omewhat revived by a cor|dial which Emily gave him; and, being again alone with her, he exerted him&s;elf to tranquillize her &s;pirits, and to offer her all the comfort of which her &s;ituation admitted. She threw her&s;elf into his arms, wept on his neck, and grief made her &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to all he &s;aid, that he cea&s;ed to offer the alleviations, which he him&s;elf could not, at this moment, feel, and mingled his &s;ilent tears with hers. Recalled, at length, to a &s;en&s;e of duty, &s;he tried to &s;pare her father from farther view of her &s;uffering; and, quitting his embrace, dried her tears, and &s;aid &s;omething, which &s;he meant for con&s;olation. "My dear Emily," replied St. Au|bert, "my dear child, we mu&s;t look up with humble confidence to that Being, who, has protected and comforted us in every dan|ger; and in every affliction we have known; to who&s;e eye ev|ery moment of our lives has been expo&s;ed; he will not, he does not for&s;ake us now. I feel his con&s;olations in my heart. I &s;hall leave you, my child &s;till in his care; and, though I depart from this world, I &s;hall be &s;till in his pre&s;ence. Nay, weep not again, my Emily. In death the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> is nothing new, or &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;ince we-all know, that we are born to die; and nothing terrible
<PB N="80" REF="029378_0041_0FE069645D9063D0">
to tho&s;e, who can confide in an all-powerful God. Had my life been &s;pared now, after a very few years, in the cour&s;e of nature, I mu&s;t have re&s;igned it; old age, with all its train of infirmity, its privations and its &s;orrows, would have been mine; and then, at la&s;t, death would have come, and called forth the tears you now &s;hed. Rather, my child, rejoice, that I am &s;aved from &s;uch &s;uf|fering, and that I am permitted to die with a mind unimpaired, and, &s;en&s;ible of the comforts of faith and of re&s;ignation." St. Aubert pau&s;ed, fatigued with &s;peaking. Emily again endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume an air of compo&s;ure; and, in replying to what he had &s;aid, tried to &s;ooth him with a belief, that he had not &s;poken in vain.</P>
<P>When he had repo&s;ed a while, he re&s;umed the conver&s;ation. "Let me return," &s;aid he, "to a &s;ubject which is very near my heart. I &s;aid I had a &s;olemn promi&s;e to receive from you; let me receive it now, before I explain the chief circum&s;tance which it concerns; there are others, of which your peace requires that you &s;hould re&s;t in ignorance. Promi&s;e, then, that you will per|form exactly what I &s;hall enjoin."</P>
<P>Emily, awed by the earne&s;t &s;olemnity of his manner, dried her tears, that had begun again to flow, in &s;pite of her efforts to &s;up|pre&s;s them; and, looking eloquently at St. Aubert, bound her|&s;elf to do whatever he &s;hould require by a vow, at which &s;he &s;hud|dered, yet knew not why.</P>
<P>He proceeded: "I know you too well, my Emily, to believe, that you would break any promi&s;e, much le&s;s one thus &s;olemnly given; your a&s;&s;urance gives me peace, and the ob&s;ervance of it is of the utmo&s;t importance to your tranquillity. Hear, then, what I am going to tell you. The clo&s;et, which adjoins my chamber at La Vallee, has a &s;liding board in the floor. You will know it by a remarkable knot in the wood, and by its be|ing the next board, except one, to the wain&s;cot, which fronts the door. At the di&s;tance of about a yard from that end, nearer the window, you will perceive a line acro&s;s it, as if the plank had been joined; the way to open it is this: Pre&s;s your foot upon the line, the end of the board will then &s;ink, and you may &s;lide it with ea&s;e beneath the other. Below, you will &s;ee a hollow place." St. Aubert pau&s;ed for breath, and Emily &s;at fixed in deep attention. "Do you under&s;tand the&s;e directions my dear?" &s;aid he. Emily, though &s;carcely able to &s;peak, a&s;&s;ured him that &s;he did.</P>
<P>"When you return home, then," he added with a deep &s;igh&mdash;</P>
<P>At the mention of her return home, all the melancholy cir|cum&s;tances, that mu&s;t attend this return, ru&s;hed upon her fancy;
<PB N="81" REF="029378_0041_0FE069645D9063D0">
&s;he bur&s;t into convul&s;ive grief, and St. Aubert him&s;elf, affected beyond the re&s;i&s;tance of the fortitude which he had, at fir&s;t, &s;um|moned, wept with her. After &s;ome moments, he compo&s;ed him|&s;elf. "My dear child," &s;aid he, "be comforted. When I am gone, you will not be for&s;aken&mdash;I leave you only in the more immediate care of that Providence, which has never yet for&s;aken me. Do not afflict me with this exce&s;s of grief; rather teach me by your example to bear my own." He &s;topped again, and Emily, the more &s;he endeavoured to re&s;train her emotion, found it the le&s;s po&s;&s;ible to do &s;o.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, who now &s;poke with pain, re&s;umed the &s;ubject. "That clo&s;et, my dear,&mdash;when you return home, go to it; and, beneath the board I have de&s;cribed, you will find a packet of written papers. Attend to me now, for the promi&s;e you have given particularly relates to what I &s;hall direct. The&s;e papers you mu&s;t burn&mdash;and, &s;olemnly I command you, <HI>without exam|ining them."</HI></P>
<P>Emily's &s;urpri&s;e, for a moment, overcame her grief, and &s;he ventured to a&s;k, why this mu&s;t be? St. Aubert replied, that, if it had been right for him to explain his rea&s;ons, her late promi&s;e would have been unnece&s;&s;arily exacted. It is &s;ufficient for you, my love, to have a deep &s;en&s;e of the importance of ob&s;erving me in this in&s;tance." St. Aubert proceeded. "Under that board you will al&s;o find about two hundred louis d'ors, wrapped in a &s;ilk pur&s;e; indeed, it was to &s;ecure whatever mon|ey might be in the chateau, that this &s;ecret place was contrived, at a time when the province was overrun by troops of men, who took advantage of the tumults, and became plunderers.</P>
<P>"But I have yet another promi&s;e to receive from you, which is&mdash;that you will never, whatever may be your future circum|&s;tances, <HI>&s;ell</HI> the chateau." St. Aubert even enjoined her, when|ever &s;he might marry, to make it an article in the contract, that the chateau &s;hould always be hers. He then gave her a more minute account of his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances than he had yet done, adding, "The two hundred louis, with what money you will now find in my pur&s;e, is all the ready money I have to leave you. I have told you how I am circum&s;tanced with M. Motteville, at Paris. Ah, my child! I leave you poor&mdash;but not de&s;titute," he added after a long pau&s;e. Emily could make no reply to any thing he now &s;aid, but knelt at the bed &s;ide, with her face upon the quilt, weeping over the hand &s;he held there.</P>
<P>After this conver&s;ation, the mind of St. Aubert appeared to be much more at ea&s;e; but exhau&s;ted by the effort of &s;peaking,

he &s;unk into a kind of doze, and Emily continued to watched weep be&s;ide him, till a gentle tap at the chamber door ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> her.

They remained alone together above half an hour; when Emi|ly was called in, &s;he &s;ound St. Aubert more agitated than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had left him, and &s;he gazed, with a &s;light degree of re&s;ent|ment, as the friar, as the cau&s;e of this; who, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mildly and mournfully at her, and turned away. St. Aubert in a tremulous voice, &s;aid, he wi&s;hed her to join in prayer with him, and a&s;ked if La Voi&s;in would do &s;o too. The old man and his daughter came; they both wept, and knelt with Emily round the bed, while the holy father read in a &s;olemn voice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ervice for the dying. St. Aubert lay with a &s;erene counte|nance, and &s;eemed to join fervently in the devotion, while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> often &s;tole from beneath his clo&s;ed eye-lids, and Emily's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more than once interrupted the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When it was concluded, and extreme unction had been ad|mini&s;tered, the friar withdrew. St. Aubert then made a &s;ign for La Voi&s;in to come nearer. He gave him his hand, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for a moment &s;ilent. At length, he &s;aid, in a trembling voice, "My good friend, our acquaintance has been &s;hort, but long enough to give you an opportunity of &s;hewing me m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch kind attention.

La Voi&s;in a&s;&s;ured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and his tears bore te&s;timony to his &s;incerity, that he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all he could to &s;often her affliction, and that if St. Aubert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, he would even attend her into Ga&s;cony; an offer &s;o plea|&s;ing to St. Aubert, that he had &s;carcely words to acknowledge

his &s;en&s;e of the old man's kindne&s;s, or to tell him, that he ac|cepted it. The &s;cene, that followed between St. Aubert and Emily, affected La Voi&s;in &s;o much, that he quitted the chamber, and &s;he was again left alone with her father, who&s;e &s;pirits &s;eem|ed fainting fa&s;t, but neither his &s;en&s;es, or his voice, yet failed him; and, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> intervals, he employed much of the&s;e la&s;t awful moments in advi&s;ing his daughter, as to her future conduct.&mdash;Perhaps, he never had thought more ju&s;tly, or expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf more clearly, than he did now.</P>
<P>"Above all, my dear Emily," &s;aid he, "do not indulge in the pride of fine feeling, the romantic error of amiable minds. Tho&s;e, who really po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;en&s;ibility, ought early to be taught, that it is a dangerous quality, which is continually extracting the exce&s;s of mi&s;ery, or delight, from every &s;urrounding circum|&s;tance. And, &s;ince, in our pa&s;&s;age through this world, painful circum&s;tances occur more frequently than plea&s;ing ones, and &s;ince our &s;en&s;e of evil is, I fear, more accute than our &s;en&s;e of good, we become the victims of our feelings, unle&s;s we can in &s;ome de|gree command them. I know you will &s;ay, (for you are young, my Emily) I know you will &s;ay, that you are contented &s;ome|times to &s;uffer, rather than to give up your refined &s;en&s;e of hap|pine&s;s, at others; but, when your mind has been long hara&s;&s;ed by vici&s;&s;itude, you will be content to re&s;t, and you will then re|cover from your delu&s;ion. You will perceive, that the phantom of happine&s;s is exchanged for the &s;ub&s;tance; for happine&s;s ari&s;es in a &s;tate of peace, not of tumult. It is of a temperate and uni|form nature, and can no more exi&s;t in a heart, that is continually alive to minute circum&s;tances, than in one that is dead to feeling. You &s;ee, my dear, that, though I would guard you again&s;t the dangers of &s;en&s;ibility, I am not an advocate for apathy. At your age I &s;hould have &s;aid <HI>that</HI> is a vice more hateful than all the errors of &s;en&s;ibility, and I &s;ay &s;o &s;till. I call it a <HI>vice,</HI> be|cau&s;e it leads to po&s;itive evil; in this, however, it does no more than an ill governed &s;en&s;ibility, which, by &s;uch a rule might al&s;o be called a vice; but the evil of the former is of more general con&s;equence. I have exhau&s;ted my&s;elf," &s;aid St. Aubert, feebly, "and have wearied you, my Emily; but, on a &s;ubject &s;o impor|tant to your future comfort, I am anxious to be perfectly under|&s;tood."</P>
<P>Emily a&s;&s;ured him, that his advice was mo&s;t precious to her, and that &s;he would never forget it, or cea&s;e from endeavouring to profit by it. St. Aubert &s;miled affectionately and &s;orrowfully upon her. "I repeat it," &s;aid he, "I would not teach you to

become in&s;en&s;ible, if I could. I would only warm you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> evils of &s;u&s;ceptibility, and point out how you may avoid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Beware, my love, I conjure you, of that &s;elf delu&s;ion, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> been fatal to the peace of &s;o many per&s;ons; beware of prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> your&s;elf on the gracefulne&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility; if you yield to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vanity, your happine&s;s is lo&s;t for ever. Always remember how much more valuable is the &s;trength of fortitude, than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;en&s;ibility. Do not, however, confound fortitude with apa|thy; apathy cannot know the virtue. Remember, too, that the act of beneficence, one act of real u&s;efulne&s;s, is worth all the ab|&s;tract &s;entiment in the world. Sentiment is a di&s;grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of an ornament, unle&s;s it lead us to good actions. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who thinks him&s;elf re&s;pectable, merely becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and thus mi&s;takes the means of doing good, for the actual ac|compli&s;hment of it, is not more blameable than the man of &s;en|timent, without active virtue. You may have ob&s;erved per&s;on, who delight &s;o much in this &s;ort of &s;en&s;ibility to &s;entiment which excludes that to the calls of any practical virtue, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> turn from the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and, becau&s;e their &s;ufferings are pain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> to be contemplated, do not endeavour to relieve them. How de&s;picable is that humanity, which can be contented to pity, where it might a&s;&s;uage!"</P>
<P>St. Aubert, &s;ometime after, &s;poke of Madam Cheron, his &s;i&s;|ter. "Let me inform you of a circum&s;tance, that nearly affects your welfare," he added, "We have, you know, had little intercour&s;e for &s;ome years; but, as &s;he is now your only female relation, I have thought it proper to con&s;ign you to her care, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you will &s;ee in my will, till you are of age, and to recommend you to her protection afterwards. She is not exactly the per&s;on, to whom I would have committed my Emily, but I had no al|ternative, and I believe her to be upon the whole&mdash;a good kind of woman. I need not recommend it to your prudence, my love, to endeavour to conciliate her kindne&s;s; you will do this for his &s;ake, who has often wi&s;hed to do &s;o for yours."</P>
<P>Emily a&s;&s;ured him, that, whatever he reque&s;ted &s;he would re|ligiou&s;ly perform to the utmo&s;t of her ability. "Alas!" added &s;he, in a voice interrupted by &s;ighs, "that will &s;oon be all which remains for me; it will be almo&s;t my only con&s;olation to fulfil your wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>St. Aubert looked up &s;ilently in her face, as if he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;poken, but his &s;pirit &s;unk a while, and his eyes became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and dull. She felt that look at her heart. "My dear father&punc; &s;he exclaimed; and then, checking her&s;elf, pre&s;&s;ed his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

clo&s;er, and hid her face with her handkerchief. Her tears were concealed, but St. Aubert heard her convul&s;ive &s;obs. His &s;pirits returned. "O my child!" &s;aid he, faintly, "let my con&s;ola|tions be yours. I die in peace; for I know, that I am about to return to the bo&s;om of my Father, who will &s;till be your Father, when I am gone. Always tru&s;t in him, my love, and he will &s;upport you in the&s;e moments, as he &s;upports me."</P>
<P>Emily could only li&s;ten, and weep; but the extreme compo|&s;ure of his manner, and the faith and hope he expre&s;&s;ed, &s;ome|what &s;oothed her angui&s;h. Yet, whenever &s;he looked upon his emaciated countenance, and &s;aw the lines of death beginning to prevail over it&mdash;&s;aw his &s;unk eyes &s;till bent on her, and their heavy lids pre&s;&s;ing to a clo&s;e, there was a pang in her heart, &s;uch as defied expre&s;&s;ion, though it required filial virtue, like hers, to forbear the attempt.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired once more to ble&s;s her; "Where are you my dear?" &s;aid he, as he &s;tretched forth his hands. Emily had turned to the window, that he might not perceive her angui&s;h; &s;he now under&s;tood, that his &s;ight had failed him. When he had given her his ble&s;&s;ing, and it &s;eemed to be the la&s;t effort of of expiring life, he &s;unk back on his pillow. She ki&s;&s;ed his forehead; the damps of death had &s;ettled there, and, forgetting her fortitude, for a moment, her tears mingled with them. St. Aubert lifted up his eyes; the &s;pirit of a father returned to them, but it quickly vani&s;hed, and he &s;poke no more.</P>
<P>St. Aubert lingered till about three o'clock in the afternoon, and, thus gradually &s;inking into death, he expired without a &s;truggle, or a &s;igh.</P>
<P>Emily was led from the chamber by La Voi&s;in and his daugh|ter; who did what they could to comfort her. The old man &s;at and wept with her. Agnes was more erroneou&s;ly officious.</P>

<P>THE monk, who had before appeared, returned in the even|ing to offer con&s;olation to Emily, and brought a kind me&s;&s;age from the lady abbe&s;s, inviting her to the convent. Emily
<PB N="86" REF="029378_0044_0FE07E7733451B58">
though &s;he did not accept the offer, returned an an&s;wer expen|&s;ive of her gratitude. The holy conver&s;ation of the friar, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mild benevolence of manners bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> St. Aubert, &s;oothed the violence of her grief, and lifted her hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Being, who, extending through all place and all eternity, looks on the events of this little world as on the &s;hadows of a moment, and beholds equally, and in the &s;ame in&s;tant, the &s;oul that has pa&s;&s;ed the gates of death, and that, which &s;till lingers i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the body. "In the &s;ight of God," &s;aid Emily, "my dear father now exi&s;ts, as truly as he ye&s;terday exi&s;ted to me; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to me only that he is dead; to God and to him&s;elf he yet live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>The good monk left her more tranquil than &s;he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> St. Aubert died; and, before &s;he retired to her little cabin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the night, &s;he tru&s;ted her&s;elf &s;o far as to vi&s;it the corp&s;e. Silent, and without weeping, &s;he &s;tood by its fide. The features, pla|cid and &s;erene, told the nature of the la&s;t &s;en&s;ations that had lin|gered in the now de&s;erted frame. For a moment &s;he turned away, in horror of the &s;tillne&s;s in which death had fixed the countenance, never till now &s;een otherwi&s;e than animated; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> gazed on it with a mixture of doubt and awful a&s;toni&s;hment.&mdash;Her rea&s;on could &s;carcely overcome an involuntary and unac|countable expectation of &s;eeing that beloved countenance &s;till &s;u&s;ceptible. She continued to gaze wildly; took up the cold hand; &s;poke; &s;till gazed, and then bur&s;t into a tran&s;port of grief. La Voi&s;in, hearing her &s;obs, came into the room to lead her away, but &s;he heard nothing, and only begged that he would leave her.</P>
<P>Again alone, &s;he indulged her tears, and, when the gloom of evening ob&s;cured the chamber, and almo&s;t veiled from her eyes the object of her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;till hung over the body; till her &s;pirits, at length were exhau&s;ted, and &s;he became tranquil. La Voi&s;in again knocked at the door, and entreated that &s;he would come to the common apartment. Before &s;he went, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the lips of St. Aubert, as &s;he was wont to do when &s;he bade him good night. Again &s;he ki&s;&s;ed them; her heart felt as if it would break, a few tears of agony &s;tarted to her eyes, &s;he looked up to heaven, then at St. Aubert, and left the room.</P>
<P>Retired to her lonely cabin, her melancholy thoughts &s;till hovered round the body of her decea&s;ed parent; and, when &s;he &s;unk into a kind of &s;lumber, the images of her waking mind &s;till haunted her fancy. She thought &s;he &s;aw her father ap|proaching her with a benign countenance; then, &s;miling mourn|fully

and pointing upwards, his lips moved, but in&s;tead of words, &s;he heard &s;weet mu&s;ic borne on the di&s;tant air, and pre|&s;ently &s;aw his features glow with the mild rapture of a &s;uperior being. The &s;train &s;eemed to &s;well louder, and &s;he awoke. The vi&s;ion was gone, but mu&s;ic yet come to her ear in &s;trains &s;uch as angels might breathe. She doubted, li&s;tened, rai&s;ed her&s;elf in the bed, and again li&s;tened. It was mu&s;ic, and not an illu&s;ion of her imagination. After a &s;olemn &s;teady harmony, it pau&s;ed; then ro&s;e again, in mournful &s;weetne&s;s, and then died, in a ca|dence, that &s;eemed to bear away the li&s;tening &s;oul to heaven. She in&s;tantly remembered the mu&s;ic of the preceding night, with the &s;trange circum&s;tances, related by La Voi&s;in, and the af|fecting conver&s;ation it had led to, concerning the &s;tate of de|parted &s;pirits. All that St. Aubert had &s;aid, on that &s;ubject, now pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart, and overwhelmed it. What a change in a few hours! He, who then could only conjecture, was now made acquainted with truth; was him&s;elf become one of the departed! As &s;he li&s;tened, &s;he was chilled with &s;uper&s;ti|tious awe, her tears &s;topped; and &s;he ro&s;e, and went to the win|dow. All without was ob&s;cured in &s;hade; but Emily, turning her eyes from the ma&s;&s;y darkne&s;s of the woods, who&s;e waving outline appeared on the horizon, &s;aw, on the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, that effulgent planet, which the old man had pointed out, &s;etting over the woods. She remembered what he had &s;aid concerning it, and the mu&s;ic now coming at intervals on the air, &s;he unclo&s;ed the ca&s;ement to li&s;ten to the &s;trains, that &s;oon gradually &s;unk to a greater di&s;tance, and tried to di&s;cover whence they came.&mdash;The ob&s;curity prevented her from di&s;tingui&s;hing any object on the green platform below; and the &s;ounds became fainter and fainter, till they &s;oftened into &s;ilence. She li&s;tened, but they re|turned no more. Soon after, &s;he ob&s;erved the planet trembling between the fringed tops of the woods, and, in the next moment, &s;ink behind them. Chilled with a melancholy awe, &s;he retired once more to her bed, and, at length, forgot for a while her &s;orrows in &s;leep.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;he was vi&s;ited by a &s;i&s;ter of the convent, who came, with kind offices and a &s;econd invitation from the lady abbe&s;s; and Emily, though &s;he could not for&s;ake the cottage, while the remains of her father were in it, con&s;ented, however painful &s;uch a vi&s;it mu&s;t be, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits, to pay her re&s;pects to the abbe&s;s, in the evening.</P>
<P>About an hour before &s;un&s;et, La Voi&s;in &s;hewed her the way through the woods to the convent, which &s;tood in a &s;mall bay
<PB N="88" REF="029378_0045_0FE07E8443261760">
of the Mediterranean, crowned by a woody amphitheatre; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emily, had &s;he been le&s;s unhappy, would have admired the ex|ten&s;ive &s;ea view, that appeared from the green &s;lope, in front of the edifice, and the rich &s;hores, hung with woods and pa&s;tures that extended on either hand. But her thoughts were now oc|cupied by one &s;ad idea, and the features of nature were to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> colourle&s;s and without form. The bell for ve&s;pers &s;truck, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the ancient gate of the convent, and &s;eemed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|neral note for St. Aubert.

The abbe&s;s led her to a &s;eat, and &s;at down be&s;ide her, &s;till holding her hand and regarding her in &s;ilence, as Emily dried her tears and attempted to &s;peak. "Be compo&s;ed, my daughter," &s;aid the abbe&s;s in a &s;oothing voice, "do not &s;peak yet; I know all you would &s;ay. Your &s;pirits mu&s;t be &s;oothed. We are going to prayers;&mdash;will you attend our evening &s;ervice? It is com|fortable, my child, to look up in our afflictions to a Father, who &s;ees and pities us, and who cha&s;tens in his mercy."</P>
<P>Emily's tears flowed again, but a thou&s;and &s;weet emotion mingled with them. The abbe&s;s &s;uffered her to weep without interruption, and watched over her with a look of benignity, that might have characterized the countenance of a guardian an|gel. Emily, when &s;he became tranquil, was encouraged to &s;peak without re&s;erve, and to mention the motive, that made her unwilling to quit the cottage, which the abbe&s;s did not op|po&s;e even by a hint; but prai&s;ed the filial piety of her conduct, and added a hope, that &s;he would pa&s;s a few days at the con|vent, before &s;he returned to La Vallee. "you mu&s;t allow your&s;elf a little time to recover from your fir&s;t &s;hock, my daugh|ter, before you encounter a &s;econd; I will not affect to conceal from you how much I know your heart mu&s;t &s;uffer, on returning to the &s;cene of your former happine&s;s.

But come," added &s;he, ob&s;erving the tears &s;well in Em|ily's eyes, "we will go to the chapel."</P>
<P>Emily followed to the parlour, where the nuns were a&s;&s;embled, to whom the abbe&s;s committed her, &s;aying, "This is a daughter, for whom I have much e&s;teem; be &s;i&s;ters to her."</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="029378_0045_0FE07E8443261760">
They pa&s;&s;ed on in a train to the chapel, where the &s;olemn de|votion, with which the &s;ervice was performed, elevated her mind, and brought to it the comforts of faith and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Twilight came on, before the abbe&s;s's kindne&s;s would &s;uffer Emily to depart, when &s;he left the convent, with a heart much lighter than &s;he had entered it, and was reconducted by La Voi&s;in through the woods, the pen&s;ive gloom of which was in uni&s;on with the temper of her mind; and &s;he pur&s;ued the little wild path, in mu&s;ing &s;ilence, till her guide &s;uddenly &s;topped, looked round, and then &s;truck out of the path into the high gra&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;aying he had mi&s;taken the road. He now walked on quickly, and Emily, proceeding with difficulty over the ob|&s;cured and uneven ground, was left at &s;ome di&s;tance, till her voice arre&s;ted him, who &s;eemed unwilling to &s;top, and &s;till hur|ried on. "If you are in doubt about the way," &s;aid Emily, "had we not better inquire it at the chateau yonder, between the trees?"</P>
<P>"No," replied La Voi&s;in, "there is no occa&s;ion. When we reach that brook, ma'am&s;elle, (you &s;ee the light upon the water there, beyond the woods) when we reach that brook, we &s;hall be at home pre&s;ently.

<P>"It is &s;olitary enough," &s;aid Emily, "but you have no ban|ditti here." "No, ma'am&s;elle&mdash;no banditti."</P>
<P>"What are you afraid of then, my good friend? you are not &s;uper&s;titious?" "No, not &s;uper&s;titious; but, to tell you the truth, lady, nobody likes to go near that chateau, after du&s;k." "By whom is it inhabited," &s;aid Emily, "that it is &s;o formi|dable?" "Why, ma'am&s;elle, it is &s;carcely inhabited, for our lord the Marquis, and the lord of all the&s;e fine woods, too, is dead. He had not once been in it, for the&s;e many years, and his people, who have the care of it, live in a cottage clo&s;e by." Emily now under&s;tood this to be the chateau, which La Voi&s;in had formerly pointed out, as having belonged to the Marquis Villeroi, on the mention of which her father had appeared &s;o much affected.</P>
<P>"Ah! it is a de&s;olate place now," continued La Voi&s;in, "and &s;uch a grand, fine place, as I remember it!" Emily in|quired what had occa&s;ioned this lamentable change; but the old-man was &s;ilent, and Emily, who&s;e intere&s;t was awakened by the fear he had expre&s;&s;ed, and above all by a recollection of her father's agitation, repeated the que&s;tion, and added, "If you are neither afraid of the inhabitants, my good friend, nor are &s;uper|&s;titious,
<PB N="90" REF="029378_0046_0FE07E8A34166190">
how happens it, that you dread to pa&s;s near that chateau in the dark?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps, then, I am a little &s;uper&s;titious, ma'am&s;elle; and, if you knew what I do, you might be &s;o too. Strange things have happened there. Mon&s;ieur, your good father, appeared to have known the late Marchione&s;s." "Pray inform me what did happen?" &s;aid Emily, with much emotion.</P>
<P>"Alas! ma'am&s;elle," an&s;wered La Voi&s;in, "inquire no fur|ther: it is not for me to lay open the dome&s;tic &s;ecrets of my lord." Emily, &s;urpri&s;ed by the old man's words, and his man|ner of delivering them, forbore to repeat her que&s;tion; a nearer intere&s;t, the remembrance of St. Aubert, occupied her thoughts, and &s;he was led to recollect the mu&s;ic &s;he heard on the preceding night, which &s;he mentioned to La Voi&s;in. "You was not alone, ma'am&s;elle, in this," he replied, "I heard it too; but I have &s;o often heard it, at the &s;ame hour, that I was &s;carcely &s;ur|pri&s;ed."</P>
<P>"You doubtle&s;s believe this mu&s;ic to have &s;ome connection with the chateau," &s;aid Emily &s;uddenly, "and are, therefore, &s;uper&s;titious." "It may be &s;o, ma'am&s;elle, but there are other circum&s;tances, belonging to that chateau, which I remember, and &s;adly too." A heavy &s;igh followed: but Emily's delicacy re|&s;trained the curio&s;ity the&s;e words revived, and &s;he inquired no further.</P>
<P>On reaching the cottage, all the violence of her grief return|ed; it &s;eemed as if &s;he had e&s;caped its heavy pre&s;&s;ure only while &s;he was removed from the object of it. She pa&s;&s;ed immediately to the chamber, where the remains of her father were laid, and yielded to all the angui&s;h of hopele&s;s grief. La Voi&s;in at length, per&s;uaded her to leave the room, and &s;he returned to her own, where, exhau&s;ted, by the &s;ufferings of the day, &s;he &s;oon fell into deep &s;leep&punc; and awoke con&s;iderably refre&s;hed.</P>
<P>When the dreadful hour arrived, in which the remains of St. Aubert were to be taken from her for ever, &s;he went alone to the chamber to look upon his countenance yet once again, and La Voi&s;in, who had waited patiently below &s;tairs, till her de&s;pair &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide, with the re&s;pect due to grief, forbore to interrupt the indulgence of it, till &s;urpri&s;e, at the length of her &s;tay, and then apprehen&s;ion overcame his delicacy, and he went to lead her from the chamber. Having tapped gently at the door, without receiving an an&s;wer, he li&s;tened attentively, but all was &s;till, no &s;igh, no &s;ob of angui&s;h was heard. Yet more alarmed by this &s;ilence, he opened the door, and found Emily lying &s;en&s;e|le&s;s
<PB N="91" REF="029378_0046_0FE07E8A34166190">
acro&s;s the foot of the bed, near which &s;tood the coffin. His calls procured a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;he was carried to her room, where proper applications, at length re&s;tored her.</P>
<P>During her &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, La Voi&s;in had given direc|tions for the coffin to be clo&s;ed, and he &s;ucceeded in per&s;uading Emily to forbear revi&s;iting the chamber. She, indeed, felt her|&s;elf unequal to this, and al&s;o perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;paring her &s;pirits, and recollecting fortitude &s;ufficient to bear her through the approaching &s;cene. St. Aubert had given a particular in|junction, that his remains &s;hould be interred in the church of the convent of St. Clair, and, in mentioning the north chancel, near the ancient tomb of the Villerois, had pointed out the exact &s;pot, where he wi&s;hed to be laid. The &s;uperior had granted this place for the interment, and thither, therefore, the &s;ad proce&s;|&s;ion now moved, which was met, at the gates, by the venerable prie&s;t, followed by a train of friars. Every per&s;on who heard the &s;olemn chant of the anthem, and the peal of the organ, that &s;truck up, when the body entered the church, and &s;aw al&s;o the feeble &s;teps, and the a&s;&s;umed tranquillity of Emily, gave her in|voluntary tears. She &s;hed none, but walked, her face partly &s;haded by a thin black veil, between two per&s;ons, who &s;upported her, prece|ded by the abbe&s;s, and followed by nuns, who&s;e plaintive voices mellowed the &s;welling harmony of the dirge. When the proce&s;|&s;ion came to the grave the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed. Emily drew the veil entirely over her face, and, in a momentary pau&s;e, between the anthem and the re&s;t of the &s;ervice, her &s;obs were di&s;tinctly audi|ble. The holy father began the &s;ervice, and Emily again com|manded her feelings, till the coffin was let down, and &s;he heard the earth rattle on its lid. Then, as &s;he &s;huddered, a groan bur&s;t from her heart, and &s;he leaned for &s;upport on the per&s;on who &s;tood next to her. In a few moments &s;he recovered; and, when &s;he heard tho&s;e affecting and &s;ublime words: "His body is buried in peace, and his &s;oul returns to Him that gave it," her angui&s;h &s;oftened into tears.</P>
<P>The abbe&s;s led her from the church into her own parlour, and there admini&s;tered all the con&s;olations, that religion and gentle &s;ympathy can give. Emily &s;truggled again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of grief; but the abbe&s;s, ob&s;erving her attentively, ordered a bed to be prepared, and recommended her to retire to repo&s;e. She al&s;o kindly claimed her promi&s;e to remain a few days at the con|vent, and Emily, who had no wi&s;h to return to the cottage, the &s;cene of all her &s;ufferings, had lei&s;ure, now that no immediate care pre&s;&s;ed upon her attention, to feel the indi&s;po&s;ition, which di&s;abled her from immediately travelling.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="029378_0047_0FE07E97AB232AC8">
Meanwhile, the maternal kindne&s;s of the abbe&s;s, and the gen|tle attentions of the nuns did all, that was po&s;&s;ible, towards &s;ooth|ing her &s;pirits and re&s;toring her health. But the latter was too deeply wounded, through the medium of her mind, to be quick|ly revived. She lingered for &s;ome weeks at the convent, under the influence of a &s;low fever, wi&s;hing to return home, yet una|ble to go thither; often even reluctant to leave the &s;pot where her father's relics were depo&s;ited, and &s;ometimes &s;oothing her&s;elf with the con&s;ideration, that, if &s;he died here, her remains would repo&s;e be&s;ide tho&s;e of St. Aubert. In the meanwhile, &s;he &s;ent letters to Madame Cheron and to the old hou&s;ekeeper, inform|ing them of the &s;ad event that had taken place, and of her own &s;ituation. From her aunt &s;he received an an&s;wer, abounding more in common-place condolement, than in traits of real &s;orrow which a&s;&s;ured her, that a &s;ervant &s;hould be &s;ent to conduct her to La Vallee, for that her own time was &s;o much occupied by company, that &s;he had no lei&s;ure to undertake &s;o long a journey. However Emily might prefer La Vallee, to Tholou&s;e, &s;he could not be in&s;en&s;ible of the indecorous and unkind conduct of her aunt, in &s;uffering her to return thither, where &s;he had no longer a re|lation to con&s;ole and protect her; a conduct, which was the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> culpable, &s;ince St. Aubert had appointed Madame Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron's &s;ervant made the attendance of the good La Voi&s;in unnece&s;&s;ary; and Emily, who felt &s;en&s;ibly her obliga|tions to him, for all his kind attention to her late father, as well as to her&s;elf, was glad to &s;pare him a long, and what, at his time of life, mu&s;t have been a trouble&s;ome journey.</P>
<P>During her &s;tay at the convent, the peace and &s;anctity that reigned within, the tranquil beauty of the &s;cenery without, and the delicate attentions of the abbe&s;s and the nuns, were circum|&s;tances &s;o &s;oothing, to her mind, that they almo&s;t tempted her to leave a world, where &s;he had lo&s;t her deare&s;t friends, and devote her&s;elf to the cloi&s;ter, in a &s;pot, rendered &s;acred to her by con|taining the tomb of St. Aubert. The pen&s;ive enthu&s;ia&s;m, too, &s;o natural to her temper, had &s;pread a beautiful illu&s;ion over the &s;anctified retirement of a nun, that almo&s;t hid from her view the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of its &s;ecurity. But the touches, which a melancholy fancy, &s;lightly tinctured with &s;uper&s;tition, gave to the mona&s;tic &s;cene, began to fade, as her &s;pirits revived, and brought once more to her heart an image, which had only tran&s;iently been bani&s;hed thence. By this &s;he was &s;ilently awakened to hope and comfort and &s;weet affections; vi&s;ions of happine&s;s gleamed
<PB N="93" REF="029378_0047_0FE07E97AB232AC8">
faintly at a di&s;tance, and, though &s;he knew them to be illu&s;ions, &s;he could not re&s;olve to &s;hut them out for ever. It was the re|membrance of Valancourt, of his ta&s;te, his genius, and of the countenance which glowed with both, that, perhaps, alone de|termined her to return to the world. The grandeur and &s;ublim|ity of the &s;cenes, amid&s;t which they had fir&s;t met, had fa&s;cinated her fancy, and had imperceptibly contributed to render Valan|court more intere&s;ting, by &s;eeming to communicate to him &s;ome|what of their own character. The e&s;teem, too, which St. Aubert had repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed for him, &s;anctioned this kindne&s;s; but, though his countenance and manner had continually expre&s;&s;ed his admiration of her, he had no otherwi&s;e declared it; and even the hope of &s;eeing him again was &s;o di&s;tant, that &s;he was &s;carce|ly con&s;cious of it, &s;till le&s;s that it influenced her conduct on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was &s;everal days after the arrival of Madame Cheron's &s;er|vant before Emily was &s;ufficiently recovered to undertake the journey to La Vallee. On the evening preceding her departure, &s;he went to the cottage to take leave of La Voi&s;in and his fami|ly, and to make them a return for their kindne&s;s. The old man &s;he found &s;itting on a bench at his door, between his daughter, and his &s;on in-law, who was ju&s;t returned from his daily labour, and who was playing upon a pipe, that, in tone, re&s;embled an oboe. A fla&s;k of wine &s;tood be&s;ide the old man, and, before him, a &s;mall table with fruit and bread, round which &s;tood &s;everal of his grand&s;ons, fine ro&s;y children, who were taking their &s;up|er, as their mother di&s;tributed it. On the edge of the little green, that &s;pread before the cottage, were cattle and a few &s;heep repo&s;ing under the trees. The land&s;cape was touched with the mellow light of the evening &s;un, who&s;e long &s;lanting beams played through a vi&s;ta of the woods, and lighted up the di&s;tant turrets of the chateau. She pau&s;ed a moment, before &s;he em|erged from the &s;hade, to gaze upon the happy group before her, on the complacency and ea&s;e of healthy age, depictured on the countenance of La Voi&s;in; the maternal tenderne&s;s of Agnes, as &s;he looked upon her children, and the innocency of infantine plea&s;ures reflected in their &s;miles. Emily looked again at the venerable old man, and at the cottage; the memory of her fa|ther ro&s;e with full force upon her mind, and &s;he ha&s;tily &s;tepped forward, afraid to tru&s;t her&s;elf with a longer pau&s;e. She took an affectionate and affecting leave of La Voi&s;in and his family; he &s;eemed to love her as his daughter, and &s;hed tears; Emily &s;hed many. She avoided going into the cottage, &s;ince &s;he
<PB N="94" REF="029378_0048_0FE07E9C480E58F0">
knew it would revive emotions, &s;uch as &s;he could not now en|dure.</P>
<P>One painful &s;cene yet awaited her, for &s;he determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;it her father's grave; and, that &s;he might not be interrupted or ob&s;erved in the indulgence of her melancholy tenderne&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deferred her vi&s;it, till every inhabitant of the convent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the nun who promi&s;ed to bring her the key of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould be retired to re&s;t. Emily remained in her chamber, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he heard the convent bell &s;trike twelve, when the nun came, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had appointed, with the key of a private door, that opened into the church, and they de&s;cended together the narrow wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ing &s;tairca&s;e that led thither. The nun offered to accompa|ny Emily to the grave, adding, "It is melancholy to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at this hour;" but the former, thanking her for the con&s;ider|ation, could not con&s;ent to have any witne&s;s of her &s;orrow; and the &s;i&s;ter, having unlocked the door, gave her the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> "You will remember, &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid &s;he, "that in the ea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which you mu&s;t pa&s;s, is a newly open grave; hold the light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the ground, that you may not &s;tumble over the loo&s;e earth." E|mily, thanking her again, took the lamp, and, &s;tepping into the church, &s;i&s;ter Mariette departed. But Emily pau&s;ed a moment at the door; a &s;udden fear came over her, and &s;he returned to the foot of the &s;tairca&s;e, where, as &s;he heard the &s;teps of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;cending, and, while &s;he held up the lamp, &s;aw her black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> waving over the &s;piral balu&s;ters, &s;he was tempted to call her back. While &s;he he&s;itated, the veil di&s;appeared, and, in the next mo|ment, a&s;hamed of her fears, &s;he returned to the church. The cold air of the ai&s;les chilled her, and their deep &s;ilence and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|tent, feebly &s;hone upon the moonlight, that &s;treamed through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tant gothic window, would at any other time have awed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into &s;uper&s;tition; now, grief occupied all her attention. She &s;carcely heard the whi&s;pering echoes of her own &s;teps, or though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the open grave, till &s;he found her&s;elf almo&s;t on its brink. A friar of the convent had been burried there on the preceding evening, and, as &s;he had &s;at alone in her chamber at twilight, &s;he heard, at di&s;tance, the monks chanting the requiem for his &s;oul. This brought fre&s;hly to her memory the circum&s;tances of her father's death; and, as the voices, mingling with a low quer|ulous peal of the organ, &s;welled faintly, gloomy and affecting vi|&s;ions had ari&s;en upon her mind. Now &s;he remembered them and, turning a&s;ide to avoid the broken ground, the&s;e recollections made her pa&s;s on with quicker &s;teps to the grave of St. Aubert when in the moonlight, that fell athwart a remote part of the
<PB N="95" REF="029378_0048_0FE07E9C480E58F0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw a &s;hadow gliding between the pillars. She &s;topped to li&s;ten, and, not hearing any foot&s;tep, believed that her fancy had deceived her, and, no longer apprehen&s;ive of be|ing ob&s;erved, proceeded. St. Aubert was buried beneath a plain marble, bearing little more than his name and the date of his birth and death, near the foot of the &s;tately monument of the Villerois. Emily remained at his grave, till a chime, that called the monks to early prayers, warned her to retire; then, &s;he wept over it a la&s;t farewel, and forced her&s;elf from the &s;pot. After this hour of melancholy indulgence, &s;he was refre&s;hed by a deeper &s;leep than &s;he had experienced for a long time, and, on awaken|ing, her mind was more tranquil and re&s;igned than it had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> St. Aubert's death.</P>
<P>But, when the moment of her departure from the convent ar|rived, all her grief returned; the memory of the dead, and the kindne&s;s of the living attached her to the place; and for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pot, where her father's remains were interred, &s;he &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> feel all tho&s;e tender affections which we conceive for home. The abbe&s;s repeated many kind a&s;&s;urances of regard at their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and pre&s;&s;ed her to return, if ever &s;he &s;hould find her condition el&s;ewhere unplea&s;ant; many of the nuns al&s;o expre&s;|&s;ed unaffected regret at her departure, and Emily left the con|vent with many tears, and followed by &s;incere wi&s;hes for her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>She had travelled &s;everal leagues, before the &s;cenes of the country, through which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, had power to rou&s;e her for a moment from the deep melancholy, into which &s;he was &s;unk, and, when they did, it was only to remind her, that, on her la&s;t view of them, St. Aubert was at her &s;ide, and to call up to her remembrance the remarks he had delivered on &s;imilar &s;cenery. Thus, without any particular occurrence, pa&s;&s;ed the day in lan|guor and dejection. She &s;lept that night at a town on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Languedoc, and on the following morning, entered Ga&s;cony.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of this day, Emily came within view of the plains in the neighbourhood of La Vallee, and the well known ob|jects of former times began to pre&s;s upon her notice, and with them recollections that awakened all her tenderne&s;s and grief. Often, while &s;he looked through her tears upon the wild gran|deur of the Pyrenees, now varied with the rich lights and &s;ha|dows of evening, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remembered, that, when la&s;t &s;he &s;aw them, her father partook with her of the plea&s;ure they in&s;pired. Sud|denly &s;ome &s;cene, which he had particularly pointed out to her,
<PB N="96" REF="029378_0049_0FE07EAAB6FEB470">
would pre&s;ent it&s;elf, and the &s;ick languor of de&s;par would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon her heart. "There!" &s;he would exclaim, "there are the very cliffs, there the wood of pines, which he looked at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch delight, as we pa&s;&s;ed this road together for the la&s;t time. There too, under the crag of that mountain, is the cottage, peeping from among the cedars, which he bade me remember, and copy with my pencil. O my father, &s;hall I never &s;ee you more!"</P>
<P>As &s;he drew near the chateau, the&s;e melancholy memorials of pa&s;t times multiplied. At length, the chateau it&s;elf appeared amid the glowing beauty of St. Aubert's favourite land&s;cape. This was an object, which called for fortitude, not for tears; Emily dried hers, and prepared to meet with calmne&s;s the trying moment of her return to that home, where there was no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a parent to welcome her. "Yes," &s;aid &s;he, "let me not forget the le&s;&s;ons he has taught me! How often he has pointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;i&s;ting even virtuous &s;orrow; how often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have admired together the greatne&s;s of a mind, that can at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uffer and rea&s;on! O my father! if you are permitted to look down upon your child, it will plea&s;e you to &s;ee that &s;he remember, and endeavours to practi&s;e, the precepts you have given her."</P>
<P>A turn on the road now allowed a nearer view of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the chimneys, tipped with light, ri&s;ing from behind St. Aubert's favourite oaks, who&s;e foliage partly concealed the lower part of the building. Emily could not &s;uppre&s;s a heavy &s;igh. "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> too, was his favourite hour," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he gazed upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> evening &s;hadows, &s;tretched athwart the land&s;cape. "How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the repo&s;e, how lovely the &s;cene! lovely and tranquil as in for|mer days!"</P>
<P>Again &s;he re&s;i&s;ted the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;orrow, till her ear caught the gay melody of the dance, which &s;he had &s;o often li&s;tened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as &s;he walked with St. Aubert, on the margin of the Garonne, when all her fortitude for&s;ook her, and &s;he continued to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> till the carriage &s;topped at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little gate that opened upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was now her own territory.

<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid There&s;a, and pau&s;ed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as if &s;he would have offered &s;omething of condolement to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who&s;e tears now prevented reply.

bark. "Ah, ma'am&s;elle!&mdash;my poor ma&s;ter!" &s;aid There&s;a, who&s;e feelings were more awakened than her delicacy, "Man|chon's gone to look for him." Emily &s;obbed aloud; and on looking towards the carriage, which &s;till &s;tood with the door open, &s;aw the animal &s;pring into it, and in&s;tantly leap out, and then with his no&s;e on the ground run round the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>"Don't cry &s;o, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid There&s;a, "it breaks my heart to &s;ee you." The dog now came running to Emily, then returned to the carriage, and then back again to her, whining and di&s;contented. "Poor rogue!" &s;aid There&s;a, "thou ha&s;t lo&s;t thy ma&s;ter, thou may'&s;t well cry! But come, my dear young lady, be comforted. What &s;hall I get to refre&s;h you?" Emily gave her hand to the old &s;ervant, and tried to re&s;train her grief, while &s;he made &s;ome kind inquiries concerning her health. But &s;he &s;till lingered in the walk which led to the chat|eau, for within was no per&s;on to meet her with the ki&s;s of af|fection; her own heart no longer palpitated with impatient joy to meet again the well known &s;mile, and &s;he dreaded to &s;ee ob|jects, which would recall the full remembrance of her former hap|pine&s;s. She moved &s;lowly towards the door, pau&s;ed, went on, and pau&s;ed again. How &s;ilent, how for&s;aken, how forlorn did the chateau appear! Trembling to enter it, yet blaming her&s;elf for delaying what &s;he could not avoid, &s;he, at length, pa&s;&s;ed into the hall; cro&s;&s;ed it with a hurried &s;tep, as if afraid to look round, and opened the door of that room, which &s;he was wont to call her own. The gloom of evening gave &s;olemnity to its &s;ilent and de&s;erted air.</P>
<P>The chairs, the tables, every article of furniture, &s;o familiar to her in happier times, &s;poke eloquently to her heart. She &s;eated her&s;elf, without immediately ob&s;erving it, in a window, which opened upon the garden, and where St. Aubert had often &s;at with her, watching the &s;un retire from the rich and exten|&s;ive pro&s;pect, that appeared beyond the groves.</P>
<P>Having indulged her tears for &s;ometime, &s;he became more compo&s;ed; and, when There&s;a, after &s;eeing the baggage depo|&s;ited in her lady's room, again appeared, &s;he had &s;o far recovered her &s;pirits, as to be able to conver&s;e with her.</P>
<P>"I have made up the green bed for you, ma'am&s;elle" &s;aid There&s;a, as &s;he &s;et the coffee upon the table. "I thought you would like it better than your own now; but I little thought this day month, that you would come back alone. A-well-a-day! the news almo&s;t broke my heart, when it did come. Who would have believed, that my poor ma&s;ter when he went from
<PB N="98" REF="029378_0050_0FE07EAF4D1FAA38">
home, would never return again!" Emily hid her face with her handkerchief, and waved her hand.</P>
<P>"Do ta&s;te the coffee," &s;aid There&s;a. "My dear young la|dy, be comforted&mdash;we mu&s;t all die. My dear ma&s;ter is a &s;aint above." Emily took the handkerchief from her face, and rai&s;ed her eyes full of tears towards heaven; &s;oon after &s;he dried them, and, in a calm, but tremulous voice, began to inquire concern|ing &s;ome of her late father's pen&s;ioners.</P>
<P>"Alas-a-day!" &s;aid There&s;a, as &s;he poured out the coffee, and handed it to her mi&s;tre&s;s, "all that could come, have been here every day to inquire after you and my ma&s;ter." She then proceeded to tell, that &s;ome were dead whom they had left well; and others, who were ill, had recovered. "And &s;ee, ma'am|&s;elle," added There&s;a, "there is old Mary coming up the gar|den now; &s;he has looked every day the&s;e three years as if &s;he would die, yet &s;he is alive &s;till. She has &s;een the chai&s;e at the door, and knows you are come home."</P>
<P>The &s;ight of this poor old woman would have been too much for Emily, and &s;he begged There&s;a would go and tell her, that &s;he was too ill to &s;ee any per&s;on that night. "To-morrow I &s;hall be better, perhaps; but give her this token of my remem|brance."</P>
<P>Emily &s;at for &s;ometime, given up to &s;orrow. Not an object, on which her eye glanced, but awakened &s;ome remembrance, that led immediately to the &s;ubject of her grief. Her favourite plants, which St. Aubert had taught her to nur&s;e; the little draw|ings, that adorned the room, which his ta&s;te had in&s;tructed her to execute; the books that he had &s;elected for her u&s;e, and which they had read together; her mu&s;ical in&s;truments, who&s;e &s;ounds he loved &s;o well, and which he &s;ometimes awakened him&s;elf&mdash;every object gave new force to &s;orrow. At length, &s;he rou&s;ed her&s;elf from this melancholy indulgence, and, &s;ummoning all her re&s;olution, &s;tepped forward to go into tho&s;e forlorn rooms, which, though &s;he dreaded to enter, &s;he knew would yet more powerfully affect her, if &s;he delayed to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed through the green-hou&s;e, her courage for a moment for&s;ook her, when &s;he opened the door of the library; and, perhaps, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;hade, which evening and the foliage of the, rees near the windows threw acro&s;s the room, heightened the &s;olemnity of her feelings on entering that apartment, where every thing &s;poke of her father. There was an armchair, in which he u&s;ed to &s;it; &s;he &s;hrunk when &s;he ob&s;erved it, for &s;he had &s;o often &s;een him &s;eated there, and the idea of him ro&s;e &s;o di&s;tinctly
<PB N="99" REF="029378_0050_0FE07EAF4D1FAA38">
to her mind, that &s;he almo&s;t fancied &s;he &s;aw him before her.&mdash;But &s;he checked the illu&s;ions of a di&s;tempered imagination, though &s;he could not &s;ubdue a certain degree of awe, which now mingled with her emotions. She walked &s;lowly to the chair, and &s;eated her&s;elf in it; there was a reading de&s;k before it, on which lay a book open, as it had been left by her father. It was &s;ome moments before &s;he recovered courage enough to examine it; and, when &s;he looked at the open page, &s;he imme|diately recollected, that St. Aubert, on the evening before his de|parture from the chateau, had read to her &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from this his favourite author. The circum&s;tance now affected her extremely; &s;he looked at the page, wept, and looked again.&mdash;To her the book appeared &s;acred and invaluable, and &s;he would not have moved it, or clo&s;ed the page, which he had left open, for the trea&s;ures of the Indies. Still &s;he &s;at before the de&s;k, and could not re&s;olve to quit it, though the increa&s;ing gloom, and the profound &s;ilence of the apartment, revived a degree of pain|ful awe. Her thoughts dwelt on the probable &s;tate of departed &s;pirits, and &s;he remembered the affecting conver&s;ation, which had pa&s;&s;ed between St. Aubert and La Voi&s;in, on the night pre|ceding his death. As &s;he mu&s;ed &s;he &s;aw the door &s;lowly open, and a ru&s;tling &s;ound in a remote part of the room &s;tartled her. Through the du&s;k &s;he thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> perceived &s;omething move.&mdash;The &s;ubject &s;he had been con&s;idering, and the pre&s;ent tone of her &s;pirits, which made her imagination re&s;pond to every im|pre&s;&s;ion of her &s;en&s;es, gave her a &s;udden terror of &s;omething &s;u|pernatural. She &s;at for a moment motionle&s;s, and then, her di&s;&s;ipated rea&s;on returning. "What &s;hould I fear?" &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;"If the &s;pirits of tho&s;e we love ever return to us, it is in kind|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>The &s;ilence, which again reigned, made her a&s;hamed of her late fears, and &s;he believed, that her imagination had deluded her, or that &s;he had heard one of tho&s;e unaccountable noi&s;es, which &s;ometimes occur in old hou&s;es. The &s;ame &s;ound, how|ever, returned; and, di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;omething moving towards her, and in the next in&s;tant pre&s;s be&s;ide her into the chair, &s;he &s;hrieked; but her fleeting &s;en&s;es were in&s;tantly recalled, on per|ceiving that it was Manchon who &s;at by her, and who now lick|ed her hands affectionately.</P>
<P>Perceiving her &s;pirits unequal to the ta&s;k &s;he had a&s;&s;igned her|&s;elf of vi&s;iting the de&s;erted rooms of the chateau this night, when &s;he left the library, &s;he walked in the garden, and down to the terrace, that overhung the river. The &s;un was now &s;et;

but, under the dark branches of the almond trees, was &s;een the &s;affron glow of the we&s;t, &s;preading beyond the twilight of mid|dle air. The bat flitted &s;ilently by; and, now and then, the mourning note of the nightingale was heard. The circum&s;tan|ces of the hour brought to her recollection &s;ome lines, which &s;he had once heard St. Aubert recite on this very &s;pot, and &s;he had now a melancholy plea&s;ure in repeating them.</P>

<P>Emily, wandering on, came to St. Aubert's favourite plane-tree, where &s;o often, at this hour, they had &s;at beneath the &s;hade together, and with her dear mother &s;o often had conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject of a future &s;tate. How often, too, had her father expre&s;&s;ed the comfort he derived from believing, that they &s;hould meet in another world I Emily, overcome by the&s;e re|collections, left the plane-tree, and, as &s;he leaned pen&s;ively o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the wall of the terrace, &s;he ob&s;erved a group of pea&s;ants dancing gaily on the banks of the Garonne, which &s;pread in broad ex|pan&s;e below, and reflected the evening light. What a contra&s;t they formed to the de&s;olate, unhappy Emily! They were gay and <HI>debonnaire,</HI> as they were wont to be when &s;he, too, was gay, when St. Aubert u&s;ed to li&s;ten to their merry mu&s;ic, with a countenance beaming plea&s;ure and benevolence. Emily, having looked for a moment on this &s;prightly band, turned away, una|ble to bear the remembrances it excited; but where, alas&punc; could &s;he turn, and not meet new objects to give acutene&s;s to grief?</P>
<P>As &s;he walked &s;lowly towards the hou&s;e, &s;he was met by There&s;a. "Dear ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, "I have been &s;eeking
<PB N="101" REF="029378_0051_0FE0802AEFAA2DD0">
you up and down this half hour, and was afraid &s;ome accident had happened to you. How can you like to wander about &s;o in this night air! Do come into the hou&s;e. Think what my poor ma&s;ter would have &s;aid, if he could &s;ee you. I am &s;ure, when my dear lady died, no gentleman could take it more to heart than he did, yet you know he &s;eldom &s;hed a tear."</P>
<P>"Pray, There&s;a, cea&s;e," &s;aid Emily, wi&s;hing to interrupt this ill-judged, but well meaning harrangue; There&s;a's loquacity, however, was not to be &s;ilenced &s;o ea&s;ily. "And when you u&s;ed to grieve &s;o," &s;he added, "he often told you how wrong it was&mdash;for that my mi&s;tre&s;s was happy. And, if &s;he was hap|py, I am &s;ure he is &s;o too; for the prayers of the poor, they &s;ay, reach heaven." During this &s;peech, Emily had walked &s;ilently into the chateau, and There&s;a lighted her acro&s;s the hall into the common &s;itting parlour, where &s;he had laid the cloth, with one &s;olitary knife and fork, for &s;upper. Emily was in the room before &s;he perceived that it was not her own apartment, but &s;he checked the emotion which inclined her to leave it, and &s;eated her&s;elf quietly by the little &s;upper table. Her father's hat hung upon the, oppo&s;ite wall; while &s;he gazed at it, a faint|ne&s;s came over her. There&s;a looked at her, and then at the ob|ject, on which her eyes were &s;ettled, and went to remove it; but Emily waved her hand&mdash;"No," &s;aid &s;he, "let it remain&punc; I am going to my chamber." "Nay ma'am&s;elle, &s;upper is ready." "I cannot take it." replied Emily, "I will go to my room, and try to &s;leep. To-morrow I &s;hall be better."</P>
<P>"This is poor doings!" &s;aid There&s;a. "Dear lady! do take &s;ome food! I have dre&s;&s;ed a phea&s;ant, and a fine one it is.

<P>"Did he?" &s;aid Emily, in a tender voice, while &s;he felt her poor heart warmed for a moment by a ray of &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>At length, her &s;pirits were entirely overcome, and &s;he retired to her room.</P>

<P>EMILY, &s;ometime after her return to La Vallee, received let|ters from her aunt, Madame Cheron, in which, after &s;ome com|mon place condolement and advice, &s;he invited her to Tholou&s;e, and added, that, as her late brother had entru&s;ted Emily's <HI>educa|tion</HI> to her, &s;he &s;hould con&s;ider her&s;elf bound to overlook <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> conduct.

<P>Though her affection would not &s;uffer her to que&s;tion even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> moment, the propriety of St. Aubert's conduct in appointing Madame for her guardian, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, that this &s;tep ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> made her happine&s;s depend, in a great degree, on the humour o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her aunt. In her reply, &s;he begged permi&s;&s;ion to remain, at pre|&s;ent, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a Vallee, mentioning the extreme dejection of her &s;pi|rits, and the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he felt for quiet and retirement to re&s;tore them. The&s;e &s;he knew were not to be found at Madame Che|ron's, who&s;e inclinations led her into a life of di&s;&s;ipation, which her ample fortune encouraged; and, having given her an&s;wer, &s;he felt &s;omewhat more at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t days of her affliction, &s;he was vi&s;ited by Mon&s;ieur Barreaux, a &s;incere mourner for St. Aubert. "I may well la|ment my friend," &s;aid he, "for I &s;hall never meet with his re|&s;emblance. If I could have found &s;uch a man in what is called &s;ociety, I &s;hould not have left it."</P>
<P>M. Barreaux's admiration of her father endeared him extreme|ly to Emily, who&s;e heart found almo&s;t its fir&s;t relief in conver|&s;ing of her parent's, with a man, whom &s;he &s;o much revered, and who, though with &s;uch an ungracious appearance, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much goodne&s;s of heart, and delicacy of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="029378_0052_0FE07EBE7AAC66A8">
Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed away in quiet retirement, and Emily's affliction began to &s;often into melancholy. She could bear to read the books &s;he had before read with her father; to &s;it in his chair in the library&mdash;to watch the flowers his hand had planted&mdash;to awaken the tones of that in&s;trument his fingers had pre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes even to play his favourite air.</P>
<P>When her mind had recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock of afflic|tion, perceiving the danger of yielding to indolence, and that activity alone could re&s;tore its tone, &s;he &s;crupulou&s;ly endeavour|ed to pa&s;s all her hours in employment. And it was now that &s;he under&s;tood the full value of the education &s;he had received from St. Aubert, for in cultivating her under&s;tanding he had &s;ecured her an a&s;ylum from indolence, without recour&s;e to di&s;&s;ipation, and rich and varied amu&s;ement and information, in|dependent of the &s;ociety, from which her &s;ituation &s;ecluded her. Nor were the good effects of this education confined to &s;elfi&s;h ad|vantages, &s;ince, St. Aubert having nouri&s;hed every amiable qua|lity of her heart, it now expanded in benevolence to all around her, and taught her; when &s;he could not remove the misfortunes of others, at lea&s;t to &s;often them by &s;ympathy and tenderne&s;s;&mdash;a benevolence that taught her to feel for all, that could &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron returned no an&s;wer to Emily's letter, who began to hope, that &s;he &s;hould be permitted to remain &s;ometime longer in her retirement, and her mind had now &s;o far recovered its &s;trength, that &s;he ventured to view the &s;cenes, which mo&s;t powerfully recalled the images of pa&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Among the&s;e was the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e; and, to indulge &s;till more the affectionate melancholy of the vi&s;it, &s;he took thither her lute, that &s;he might again hear there the tones, to which St. Aubert and her mother had &s;o often delighted to li&s;ten. She went alone, and at that &s;till hour of the evening, which is &s;o &s;oothing to fancy and to grief. The la&s;t time &s;he had been here &s;he was in company with Mon&s;ieur and Madame St. Aubert, a few days preceding that, on which the latter was &s;eized with a fatal illne&s;s Now, when Emily again entered the woods, that &s;urrounded the build|ing, they awakened &s;o forcibly the memory of former times, that her re&s;olution yielded for a moment to exce&s;s of grief.&mdash;She &s;topped, leaned for &s;upport again&s;t a tree, and wept for &s;ome minutes, before &s;he had recovered her&s;elf &s;ufficiently to proceed. The little path, that led to the building, was overgrown with gra&s;s, and the flowers which St. Aubert had &s;cattered carele&s;sly along the border were almo&s;t choked with weeds&mdash;the tall thi&s;|tle&mdash;the fox-glove, and the nettle. She often pau&s;ed to look on

the de&s;olate &s;pot, now &s;o &s;ilent and for&s;aken, and when, with a trembling hand, &s;he opened the door of the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, "Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, "every thing&mdash;every thing remains as when I left it la&s;t&mdash;left it with tho&s;e who never mu&s;t return!" She went to a window, that overhung the rivulet, and leaning over it, with her eyes fixed on the current, was &s;oon lo&s;t in melancholy reve|rie. The lute &s;he had brought lay forgotten be&s;ide her; the mournful &s;ighing of the breeze, as it waved the high pines above, and its &s;ofter whi&s;pers among the o&s;iers, that bowed upon the banks below, was a kind of mu&s;ic more in uni&s;on with her feelings. It did not vibrate on the chords of unhappy memory, but was &s;oothing to the heart as the voice of Pity. She contin|ued to mu&s;e, uncon&s;cious of the gloom of evening, and that the &s;un's la&s;t light trembled on the heights above, and would proba|bly have remained &s;o much longer, if a &s;udden foot&s;tep, without the building, had not alarmed her attention, and fir&s;t made her recollect that &s;he was unprotected. In the next moment, a door opened, and a &s;tranger appeared, who &s;topped on perceiving Em|ily, and then began to apologize for his intru&s;ion. But Emily, at the &s;ound of his voice, lo&s;t her fear in a &s;tronger emotion; its tones were familiar to her ear, and, though &s;he could not readily di&s;tingui&s;h through the du&s;k the features of the per&s;on who &s;poke, &s;he felt a remembrance too &s;trong to be di&s;tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>He repeated his apology, and Emily then &s;aid &s;omething in reply, when the &s;tranger, eagerly advancing, exclaimed, "Good God! can it be&mdash;&s;urely I am not mi&s;taken&mdash;ma'am&s;elle St. Au|bert&mdash;is it not?"</P>
<P>"It is indeed," &s;aid Emily, who was confirmed in her fir&s;t conjecture, for &s;he now di&s;tingui&s;hed the countenance of Valan|court, lighted up with &s;till more than its u&s;ual animation. A thou|&s;and painful recollections crowded to her mind, and the effort, which &s;he made to &s;upport her&s;elf, only &s;erved to increa&s;e her agitation. Valancourt, meanwhile, having inquired anxiou&s;ly after her health, and expre&s;&s;ed his hopes, that M. St. Aubert had found benefit from travelling, learned from the flood of tears, which &s;he could no longer repre&s;s, the fatal truth. He led her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o a &s;eat, and &s;at down by her, while Emily continued to weep, and Valancourt to hold the hand, which &s;he was uncon&s;cious he had taken, till it was wet with the tears, which grief for St. Au|bert, and &s;ympathy for her&s;elf had called forth.</P>
<P>"I feel," &s;aid he, at length, "I feel how in&s;ufficient all at|tempt at con&s;olation mu&s;t be on this &s;ubject. I can only mourn with you, for I cannot doubt the &s;ource of your tears. Would to God I were mi&s;taken!"</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="029378_0053_0FE07EC3398710E8">
Emily could &s;till an&s;wer only by tears, till &s;he ro&s;e, and beg|ged they might leave the melancholy &s;pot, when Valancourt, though he &s;aw her feeblene&s;s, could not offer to detain her, but took her arm within his, and led her from the fi&s;hing hou&s;e. They walked &s;ilently through the woods, Valancourt anxious to know, yet fearing to a&s;k any particulars concerning St. Aubert; and Emily too much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to conver&s;e. After &s;ometime, however, &s;he acquired fortitude enough to &s;peak of her father, and to give a brief account of the manner of his death; during which recital, Valancourt's countenance betrayed &s;trong emotion, and, when he heard that St. Aubert had died on the road, and that Emily had been left among &s;trangers, he pre&s;&s;ed her hand between his, and involuntarily exclaimed, "Why was I not there!" but in the next moment recollected him&s;elf, for he im|mediately returned to the mention of her father; till, perceiving that her &s;pirits were exhau&s;ted, he gradually changed the &s;ubject, and &s;poke of him&s;elf. Emily thus learned, that, after they had parted, he had wandered for &s;ometime, along the &s;hores of the Mediterranean, and had then returned through Languedoc into Ga&s;cony, which was his native province, and where he u&s;ually re&s;ided.</P>
<P>When he had concluded his little narrative, he &s;unk into a &s;ilence, which Emily was not di&s;po&s;ed to interrupt, and it con|tinued, till they reached the gate of the chateau, when he &s;top|ped, as if he had known this to be the limit of his walk. Here, &s;aying, that it was his intention to return to E&s;tuviere on the fol|lowing day, he a&s;ked her if &s;he would permit him to take leave of her in the morning; and Emily, perceiving that &s;he could not reject an ordinary civility, without expre&s;&s;ing by her refu&s;al an expectation of &s;omething more, was compelled to an&s;wer, that &s;he &s;hould be at home.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed a melancholy evening, during which the retro&s;pect of all that had happened, &s;ince &s;he had &s;een Valancourt, would ri&s;e to her imagination; and the &s;cene of her father's death ap|peared in tints as fre&s;h, as if it had pa&s;&s;ed on the preceding day. She remembered particularly the earne&s;t and &s;olemn manner, in which he had required her to de&s;troy the manu&s;cript papers, and, awakening from the lethargy, in which &s;orrow had held her, &s;he was &s;hocked to think &s;he had not yet obeyed him, and determin|ed, that another day &s;hould not reproach her with the neglect.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the next morning, Emily ordered a fire to be lighted in the &s;tove of the chamber, where St. Aubert u&s;ed to &s;leep; and, as &s;oon as &s;he had breakfa&s;ted, went thither to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the papers. Having fa&s;tened the door to prevent interruption, &s;he opened the clo&s;et where they were concealed, as &s;he entered which, &s;he felt an emotion of unu&s;ual awe, and &s;tood for &s;ome moments &s;urvey|ing it, trembling, and almo&s;t afraid to remove the board. There was a great chair in one corner of the clo&s;et, and, oppo&s;ite to it, &s;tood the table, at which &s;he had &s;een her father &s;it, on the even|ing that preceded his departure, looking over, with &s;o much emo|tion, what &s;he believed to be the&s;e very papers.</P>
<P>The &s;olitary life, which Emily had led of late, and the me|lancholy &s;ubjects, on which &s;he had &s;uffered her thoughts to dwell, had rendered her at times &s;en&s;ible to the "thick-coming fancies" of a mind greatly enervated. It was lamentable, that her excellent under&s;tanding &s;hould have yielded, even for a mo|ment, to the reveries of &s;uper&s;tition, or rather to tho&s;e &s;tarts of imagination, which deceive the &s;en&s;es into what can be called nothing le&s;s than momentary madne&s;s. In&s;tances of this tempo|rary failure of mind had more than once occurred &s;ince her re|turn home; particularly when, wandering through this lonely man&s;ion in the evening twilight, &s;he had been alarmed by ap|pearances, which would have been un&s;een in her more cheerful days. To this infirm &s;tate of her nerves may be attributed what &s;he imagined, when her eyes glancing a &s;econd time on the arm|chair, which &s;tood in an ob&s;cure part of the clo&s;et, the counte|nance of her dead father appeared there. Emily &s;tood fixed for a moment to the floor, after which &s;he left the clo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. Her &s;pi|rits, however, &s;oon returned; &s;he reproached her&s;elf with the weakne&s;s of thus &s;uffering interruption in an act of &s;erious im|portance, and again opened the door. By the directions which St. Aubert had given her, &s;he readily found the beard he had de&s;cribed in an oppo&s;ite corner of the clo&s;et, near the window; &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed al&s;o the line he had mentioned, and, pre&s;&s;ing it as he had bade her, it &s;lid down, and di&s;clo&s;ed the bundle of pa|pers, together with &s;ome &s;cattered ones, and the pur&s;e of louis.
<PB N="107" REF="029378_0054_0FE07ED0B3F2D7E8">
With a trembling hand &s;he removed them, replaced the board, pau&s;ed a moment, and was ri&s;ing from the floor, when, on look|ing up, there appeared to her alarmed fancy the &s;ame countenance in the chair. The illu&s;ion, another in&s;tance of the unhappy ef|fect which &s;olitude and grief had gradually produced upon her mind, &s;ubdued her &s;pirits; &s;he ru&s;hed forward into the chamber, and &s;unk almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s into a chair. Returning rea&s;on &s;oon overcame the dreadful, but pitiable, attack of imagination, and &s;he turned to the papers, though &s;till with &s;o little recollection, that her eyes involuntarily &s;ettled on the writing of &s;ome loo&s;e &s;heets, which lay open; and &s;he was uncon&s;cious, that &s;he was tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ing her father's &s;trict injunction, till a &s;entence of dreadful import awakened her attention and her memory together. She ha&s;tily put the papers from her; but the words, which had rou&s;ed equally her curio&s;ity and terror, &s;he could not di&s;mi&s;s from her thoughts. So powerfully had they affected her, that &s;he even could not re|&s;olve to de&s;troy the papers immediately; and the more &s;he dwelt on the circum&s;tance, the more it inflamed her imagination. Urged by the mo&s;t forcible, and apparently the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, curio&s;ity to inquire farther, concerning the terrible and my&s;teri|ous &s;ubject, to which &s;he had &s;een an illu&s;ion, &s;he began to la|ment her promi&s;e to de&s;troy the papers. For a moment, &s;he even doubted, whether it could ju&s;tly be obeyed, in contradiction to &s;uch rea&s;ons as there appeared to be for further information. But the delu&s;ion was momentary.</P>
<P>"I have given a &s;olemn promi&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, "to ob&s;erve a &s;olemn injunction, and it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to argue, but to obey. Let me ha&s;ten to remove the temptation, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> would de&s;troy my innocence, and embitter my life with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of irre|mediable guilt, while I have &s;trength to reject it."</P>
<P>Thus reanimated with a &s;en&s;e of her duty, &s;he completed the triumph of integrity over temptation, more forcible than any &s;he had ever known, and con&s;igned the papers to the flames. Her eyes watched them as they &s;lowly con&s;umed, &s;he &s;huddered at the recollection of the &s;entence &s;he had ju&s;t &s;een, and at the cer|tainty, that the only opportunity of explaining it was then pa&s;&s;ing away for ever.</P>
<P>It was long after this, that &s;he recollected the pur&s;e; and as &s;he was depo&s;iting it, unopened, in a cabinet, perceiving that it contained &s;omething of a &s;ize larger than coin, &s;he examined it. "His hand depo&s;ited them here," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he ki&s;&s;ed &s;ome pieces of the coin, and wetted them with her tears, "his hand&mdash;which is now du&s;t!" At the bottom of the pur&s;e was a &s;mall
<PB N="108" REF="029378_0055_0FE07ED54ADB1550">
packet, having taken out which, and unfolded paper after paper&punc; &s;he found to be an ivory ca&s;e, containing the miniature of a&mdash;lady! She &s;tarted&mdash;"The &s;ame," &s;aid &s;he, "my father wept over!" On examining the countenance &s;he could recollect no per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it re&s;embled. It was of uncommon beauty, and was characteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed by an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weetne&s;s, &s;haded with &s;orrow, and tem|pered by re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>St. Aubert had given no directions concerning this picture, nor had even named it; &s;he, therefore, thought her&s;elf ju&s;tified in pre&s;erving it. More than once remembering his manner, when he had &s;poken of the Marchione&s;s of Villeroi, &s;he felt in|clined to believe that this was her re&s;emblance; yet there ap|peared no rea&s;on why he &s;hould have pre&s;erved a picture of that lady, or, having pre&s;erved it, why he &s;hould lament over it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a manner &s;o &s;triking and affecting as &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed on the night preceding his departure.</P>
<P>Emily &s;till gazed on the countenance, examining its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but &s;he knew not where to detect the charm that captivated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> attention, and in&s;pired &s;entiments of &s;uch love and pity. Dark brown hair played carele&s;sly along the open forehead; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was rather inclined to aquiline; the lips &s;poke in a &s;mile, but it was a melancholy one, the eyes were blue, and were directed upwards with an expre&s;&s;ion of peculiar meekne&s;s, while the &s;oft cloud of the brow &s;poke the fine &s;en&s;ibility of the temper.</P>
<P>Emily was rou&s;ed from the mu&s;ing mood into which the picture had thrown her, by the clo&s;ing of the garden gate; and, on turning her eyes to the window, &s;he &s;aw Valancourt coming towards the chateau. Her &s;pirits agitated by the &s;ubjects that had lately occupied her mind, &s;he felt unprepared to &s;ee him, and remained a few moments in the chamber to recover her&s;elf.</P>
<P>When &s;he met him in the parlour, &s;he was &s;truck with the change that appeared in his air and countenance &s;ince they had parted in Rou&s;illon, which twilight and the di&s;tre&s;s &s;he &s;uffered on the preceding evening had prevented her from ob&s;erving. But dejection and languor di&s;appeared, for a moment, in the &s;mile that now enlightened his countenance, on perceiving her. "You &s;ee," &s;aid he, "I have availed my&s;elf of the permi&s;&s;ion with which you honoured me&mdash;of bidding <HI>you</HI> farewel, whom I had the happine&s;s of meeting only ye&s;terday."</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled faintly, and, anxious to &s;ay &s;omething, a&s;ked if he had been long in Ga&s;cony. "A few days only," replied Valancourt, while a blu&s;h pa&s;&s;ed over his cheek. "I engaged in a long ramble after I had the misfortune of parting with the
<PB N="109" REF="029378_0055_0FE07ED54ADB1550">
friends who had made my wanderings among the Pyrenees &s;o delightful."</P>
<P>A tear came to Emily's eye, as Valancourt &s;aid this, which he ob&s;erved; and, anxious to draw off her attention from the re|membrance that had occa&s;ioned it, as well as &s;hocked at his own thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, he began to &s;peak on other &s;ubjects; ex|pre&s;&s;ing his admiration of the chateau, and its pro&s;pects. Emily, who felt &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed how to &s;upport a conver&s;ation, was glad of &s;uch an opportunity to continue it on indifferent topics. They walked down to the terrace, where Valancourt was charmed with the river &s;cenery, and the views over the op|po&s;ite &s;hores of Guienne.</P>
<P>As he leaned on the wall of the terrace, watching the rapid current of the Garonne. "I was a few weeks ago," &s;aid he, "at the &s;ource of this noble river; I had not then the happine&s;s of knowing you, or I &s;hould have regretted your ab&s;ence&mdash;it was a &s;cene &s;o exactly &s;uited to your ta&s;te. It ri&s;es in a part of the Pyrenees, &s;till wilder and more &s;ublime, I think, than any we pa&s;&s;ed in the way to Roufillon." He then de&s;cribed its fall among the precipices of the mountains, where its waters, aug|mented by the &s;treams that de&s;cend from the &s;nowy &s;ummits around, ru&s;h into the Vallee d'Aran, between who&s;e romantic heights it foams along, pur&s;uing its way to the north we&s;t till it emerges upon the plains of Languedoc. Then, wa&s;hing the walls of Tholou&s;e, and turning again to the north we&s;t, it a&s;|&s;umes a milder character, as it fertilizes the pa&s;tures of Ga&s;cony and Guienne, in its progre&s;s to the Bay of Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>Emily and Valancourt talked of the &s;cenes they had pa&s;&s;ed a|mong the Pyrenean Alps: as he &s;poke of which there was often a tremulous tenderne&s;s in his voice, and &s;ometimes he expatiated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them with all the fire of genius, &s;ometimes would appear &s;carcely con&s;cious of the topic, though he continued to &s;peak.&mdash;This &s;ubject recalled forcibly to Emily the idea of her father, who&s;e image appeared in every land&s;cape, which Valancourt particularized, who&s;e remarks dwelt upon her memory, and who&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;till glowed in her heart. Her &s;ilence, at length, reminded Valancourt how nearly his conver&s;ation ap|proached to the occa&s;ion of her grief, and he changed the &s;ubject, though for one &s;carcely le&s;s affecting to Emily. When he ad|mired the grandeur of the plane-tree, that &s;pread its wide bran|ches over the terrace, and under who&s;e &s;hade they now &s;at, &s;he remembered how often &s;he had &s;at thus with St. Aubert, and heard him expre&s;s the &s;ame admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="029378_0056_0FE07EE3A7F5F718">
"This was a favourite tree with my dear father," &s;aid &s;he&punc; "he u&s;ed to love to &s;it under its foliage with his family about him, in the fine evenings of &s;ummer."</P>
<P>Valancourt under&s;tood her feelings, and was &s;ilent; had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rai&s;ed her eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the ground &s;he would have &s;een tears i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his. He ro&s;e, and leaned on the wall of the terrace, from which, in a few moments, he returned to his &s;eat, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again, and appeared to be greatly agitated; while Emily found her &s;pirits &s;o much depre&s;&s;ed, that &s;everal of her attempts to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> new the conver&s;ation were ineffectual. Valancourt again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> down, but was &s;till &s;ilent, and trembled. At length he &s;aid, with a he&s;itating voice, "This lovely &s;cene!&mdash;I am going to leave&mdash;to leave you&mdash;perhaps for ever! The&s;e moments may never return, I cannot re&s;olve to neglect, though I &s;carcely dare to avail my&s;elf of them. Let me, however, without of|fending the delicacy of your &s;orrow&punc; venture to declare the ad|miration I mu&s;t always feel of your goodne&s;s&mdash;O! that at &s;ome future period I might be permitted to call it love!"</P>
<P>Emily's emotion would not &s;uffer her to reply; and Valan|court, who now ventured to look up, ob&s;erving her countenance change, expected to &s;ee her faint, and made an involuntary ef|fort to &s;upport her, which recalled Emily to a &s;en&s;e of her &s;itu|ation, and to an exertion of her &s;pirits. Valancourt did not appear to notice her indi&s;po&s;ition, but when he &s;poke again, his voice told the tendere&s;t love. "I will not pre&s;ume," he added, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this &s;ubject longer upon your attention at this time, but I may, perhaps, be permitted to mention, that the&s;e parting moments would lo&s;e much of their bitterne&s;s if I might be al|lowed to hope the declaration I have made would not exclude me from your pre&s;ence in future."</P>
<P>Emily made another effort to overcome the confu&s;ion of her thoughts, and to &s;peak. She feared to tru&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he preference her heart acknowledged towards Valancourt, and to give him any encouragement for hope, on &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance. For though in this narrow period &s;he had ob&s;erved much that was admirable in his ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition, and though the&s;e ob&s;er|vations had been &s;anctioned by the opinion of her father, they were not &s;ufficient te&s;timonies of his general worth to deter|mine her upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubject &s;o infinitely important to her future happine&s;s as that, which now &s;olicited her attention. Yet, though the thought of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Valancourt was &s;o very painful to her, that &s;he could &s;carcely endure to pau&s;e upon it, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of this made her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the partiality of her judgment,
<PB N="111" REF="029378_0056_0FE07EE3A7F5F718">
and he&s;itate &s;till more to encourage that &s;uit, for which her own heart too tenderly pleaded. The family of Valancourt, if not his circum&s;tances, had been known to her father, and known to be unexceptionable. Of his circum&s;tances, Valancourt him&s;elf hinted as far as delicacy would permit, when he &s;aid he had at pre&s;ent little el&s;e to offer but an heart that adored her. He had &s;olicited only for a di&s;tant hope, and &s;he could not re&s;olve to forbid, though &s;he &s;carcely dared to permit it; at length, &s;he acquired courage to &s;ay, that &s;he mu&s;t think her&s;elf honoured by the good opinion of any per&s;on, whom her father had e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>"And was I, then, thought worthy of his e&s;teem?" &s;aid Valancourt, in a voice trembling with anxiety; then checking him&s;elf, he added, "But pardon the que&s;tion; I &s;carcely know what I &s;ay. If I might dare to hope, that you think me not unworthy &s;uch honour, and might be permitted &s;ometimes to inquire after your health, I &s;hould now leave you with com|parative tranquillity."</P>
<P>Emily, after a moment's &s;ilence, &s;aid, "I will be ingenuous with you, for I know you will under&s;tand, and allow for my &s;ituation; you will con&s;ider it as a proof of my&mdash;my e&s;teem that I am &s;o. Though I live here in what was my father's hou&s;e, I live here alone. I have, alas! no longer a parent&mdash;a parent who&s;e pre&s;ence might &s;anction your vi&s;its. It is unnece&s;|&s;ary for me to point out the impropriety of my receiving them."</P>
<P>"Nor will I affect to be in&s;en&s;ible of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">," replied Valan|court, adding mournfully&mdash;"bet what is to con&s;ole me for my candour? I di&s;tre&s;s you, and would now leave the &s;ubject, if I might carry with me a hope of being &s;ometime permitted to renew it, of being allowed to make my&s;elf known to your family."</P>
<P>Emily was again confu&s;ed, and again he&s;itated what to reply; &s;he felt mo&s;t acutely the difficulty&mdash;the forlornne&s;s of her &s;itua|tion, which did not allow her a &s;ingle relative, or friend, to whom &s;he could turn for even a look, that might &s;upport and guide her in the pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances. Madame Cheron, who was her only relative, and ought to have been this friend, was either occupied by her own amu&s;ements, or &s;o re|&s;entful of the reluctance her niece had &s;hewn to quit La Vallee, that &s;he &s;eemed totally to have abandoned her.</P>
<P>"Ah! I &s;ee," &s;aid Valancourt, after a long pau&s;e, during which Emily had begun and left unfini&s;hed two or three &s;enten|ces, "I &s;ee that I have nothing to hope; my fears were too ju&s;t, you think me unworthy of your e&s;teem. That fatal jour|ney!

<P>His voice faltered, and he abruptly quitted his &s;eat and walk|ed on the terrace. There was an expre&s;&s;ion of de&s;pair on his countenance, that affected Emily. The pleadings of her heart overcame, in &s;ome degree, her extreme timidity, and, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;umed his &s;eat, &s;he &s;aid, in an accent that betrayed her tender|ne&s;s, "You do both your&s;elf and me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> when you &s;ay I think you unworthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;teem; I will acknowledge that you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and&mdash;an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;"</P>

<P>He pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips, it was cold and trembling; and, rai&s;ing his eyes, he &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he palene&s;s of her countenance.&mdash;Tears came to her relief, and Valancourt watched in anxious &s;ilence over her.

<P>Then, forgetting his re&s;olution, he again &s;poke of him&s;elf. "You know not," &s;aid he, "the many anxious hours I have pa&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear you lately, when you believed me, if indeed you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> with a thought, far away.

The&s;e grounds are not entirely new to me. Once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ventured within the fence and &s;pent one of the happie&s;t, and yet mo&s;t melancholy hours of my life in walking under what I believed to be your window."</P>
<P>Emily inquired how long Valancourt had been in the neigh|bourhood. "Several days," he replied. It was my de&s;ign to
<PB N="113" REF="029378_0057_0FE07EE8C80A74D8">
avail my&s;elf of the permi&s;&s;ion M. St. Aubert had given me. I &s;carcely know how to account for it; but, though I anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed to do this, my re&s;olution always failed when the moment approached, and I con&s;tantly deferred my vi&s;it. I lodged in a village at &s;ome di&s;tance, and wandered with my dogs, among the &s;cenes of this charming country, wi&s;hing continually to meet you, yet not daring to vi&s;it you."</P>
<P>Having thus continued to conver&s;e, without perceiving the flight of time, Valancourt, at length &s;eemed to recollect him&s;elf. "I mu&s;t go," &s;aid he mournfully, "but it is with the hope of &s;eeing you again, of being permitted to pay my re&s;pects to your family; let me hear this hope confirmed by your voice." My family will be happy to &s;ee any friend of my dear father," &s;aid Emily. Valancourt ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and &s;till lingered unable to depart, while Emily &s;at &s;ilently with her eyes bent on the ground; and Valancourt as he gazed on her, con&s;idered that it would &s;oon be impo&s;&s;ible fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> him to recall, even to his memory, the ex|act re&s;emblance of the beautiful countenance he then beheld; at this moment an ha&s;ty foot&s;tep approached from behind the plane-tree, and, turning her eyes, Emily &s;aw Madame Cheron. She felt a blu&s;h &s;teal upon her cheek, and her frame trembled with the emotion of her mind; but &s;he in&s;tantly ro&s;e to meet her vi|&s;itor. "So niece," &s;aid Madame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, ca&s;ting a look of &s;ur|pri&s;e and inquiry on Valancourt, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o niece, how do you do? But I need not a&s;k, your looks tell me you have already recover|ed your lo&s;s."</P>
<P>"My looks do me inju&s;tice then, Madam, my lo&s;s I know can never be recovered."</P>
<P>"Well&mdash;well! I will not argue with you&punc; I &s;ee you have exactly your father's di&s;po&s;ition; and let me tell you it would have been much happier for him, poor man! if it had been a different one."</P>
<P>A look of dignified di&s;plea&s;ure, with which Emily regarded Madame Cheron, while &s;he &s;poke, would have touched a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mo&s;t any other heart: &s;he made no other reply, but introduced Va|lancourt, who could &s;carcely &s;tifle the re&s;entment he felt, and who&s;e bow Madame Cheron returned with a &s;light curte&s;y, and a look of &s;upercilious examination. After a few moments he took leave of Emily, in a manner, that ha&s;tily expre&s;&s;ed his pain both at his own departure, and at leaving her to the &s;ociety of Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>"Who is that young man?" &s;aid her aunt, in an accent, which equally implied inqui&s;itivene&s;s and cen&s;ure. "Some idle
<PB N="114" REF="029378_0058_0FE07EFA44BA0988">
admirer of yours I &s;uppo&s;e; but I believed niece, you had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> greater &s;en&s;e of propriety, than to have received the vi&s;its of any young man, in your pre&s;ent unfriended &s;ituation. Let me te&s;t you the world will ob&s;erve tho&s;e things, and it will talk, aye and very freely too."</P>
<P>Emily, extremely &s;hocked at this coar&s;e &s;peech, attempted to interrupt it; but Madame Cheron would proceed, with all the &s;elf importance of a per&s;on to whom power is new.</P>
<P>"It is very nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould be under the eye of &s;ome per&s;on more able to guide you than your&s;elf. I, indeed, have not much lei&s;ure for &s;uch a ta&s;k; however, &s;ince your poor father made it his la&s;t reque&s;t, that I &s;hould overlook your conduct&mdash;I mu&s;t even take you under my care. But this let me tell you niece, that, unle&s;s you will determine to be very conformable to my direction, I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf longer about you."</P>
<P>Emily made no attempt to interrupt Madame Cheron a &s;econd time, grief and the pride of con&s;cious innocence kept her &s;ilent, till her aunt &s;aid, "I am now come to take you with me to Tho|lou&s;e&punc; I am &s;orry to find, that your poor father died, after all, in &s;uch indifferent circum&s;tances; however. I &s;hall take you home with me. Ah! poor man, he was always more generous than provident, or he would not have left his daugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> depen|dent on his relations."</P>
<P>"Nor has he done &s;o, I hope, madam," &s;aid Emily calmly, "nor did his pecuniary misfortunes ari&s;e from that noble gene|ro&s;ity, which always di&s;tingui&s;hed him. The affairs of M. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Motteville may, I tru&s;t, yet be &s;ettled without deeply injuring his creditors, and in the meantime I &s;hould be very happy to re|main at La Vallee."</P>
<P>"No doubt you would," replied Madame Cheron, with a &s;mile of irony, "and I &s;hall no doubt con&s;ent to this, &s;ince I &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary tranquillity and retirement are to re&s;tore your &s;pi|rits. I did not think you capable of &s;o much duplicity, niece; when you pleaded this excu&s;e for remaining here, I fooli&s;hly be|lieved it to be a ju&s;t one, nor expected to have found with you &s;o agreeable a companion as this M. La Val&mdash;, I forget his name."</P>
<P>Emily could no longer endure the&s;e cruel indignities. "It was a ju&s;t one, madam," &s;aid &s;he; "and now, indeed, I feel more than ever the value of retirement I then &s;olicited; and if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> purport of your vi&s;it is only to add in&s;ult to the &s;orrows of your brother's child &s;he could well have &s;pared it."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee that I have undertaken a very trouble&s;ome ta&s;k," &s;aid Madame Cheron, colouring highly. "I am &s;ure, madam," &s;aid
<PB N="115" REF="029378_0058_0FE07EFA44BA0988">
Emily mildly, and endeavouring to re&s;train her tears, "I am &s;ure my father did not mean it &s;hould be &s;uch. I have the hap|pine&s;s to reflect, that my conduct under his eye was &s;uch as he often delighted to approve. It would be very painful to me to di&s;obey the &s;i&s;ter of &s;uch a parent, and, if you believe the ta&s;k will really be &s;o trouble&s;ome, I mu&s;t lament, that it is yours."</P>
<P>"Well niece, fine &s;peaking &s;ignifies little. I am willing, in con&s;ideration of my poor brother, to overlook the impropriety of your late conduct, and to try what your future will be."</P>
<P>Emily interrupted her, to beg &s;he would explain what was the impropriety &s;he alluded to.</P>
<P>"What impropriety! why that of receiving the vi&s;its of a lover unknown to your family," replied Madame Cheron, not con&s;idering the impropriety of which &s;he had her&s;elf been guilty&punc; in expo&s;ing her niece to the po&s;&s;ibility of conduct &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>A faint blu&s;h pa&s;&s;ed over Emily's countenance; pride and anxiety &s;truggled in her brea&s;t; and, till &s;he recollected, that appearances did, in &s;ome degree, ju&s;tify her aunt's &s;u&s;picions, &s;he could not re&s;olve to humble her&s;elf &s;o far as to enter into the defence of a conduct, which had been &s;o innocent and unde&s;ign|ing on her part. She mentioned the manner of Valancourt's in|troduction to her father; the circum&s;tance of his receiving the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and of their afterwards travelling together; with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> way, in which &s;he had met him, on the preceding evening. She owned he had declared a partiality for her, and that he had a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to addre&s;s her family.</P>
<P>"And who is this young adventurer, pray?" &s;aid Madame Cheron, "and what are his preten&s;ions?" The&s;e he mu&s;t him|&s;elf explain, madam," replied Emily. "Of his family my fa|ther was not ignorant, and I believe it is unexceptionable." She then proceeded to mention what &s;he knew concerning it.</P>
<P>"O, then, this it &s;eems is a younger brother," exclaimed her aunt, "and of cour&s;e a beggar. A very fine tale indeed! And &s;o my brother took a fancy to this young man after only a few days acquaintance!&mdash;but that was &s;o like him! In his youth he was always taking the&s;e likes and di&s;likes, when no other per&s;on &s;aw any rea&s;on for them at all; nay, indeed, I have often thought the people he di&s;approved were much more agreeable than tho&s;e he admired; but there is no accounting for ta&s;tes. He was always &s;o much influenced by people's countenances; now I, for my part, have no notion of this, it is all ridiculous enthu&s;ia&s;m. What has a man's face to do with his character? Can a man of good
<PB N="116" REF="029378_0059_0FE07EFF2B6498C8">
character help having a di&s;agreeable face?" which la&s;t &s;entence Madame Cheron delivered with the deci&s;ive air of a per&s;on who congratulates her&s;elf on having made a grand di&s;covery, and be|lieves the que&s;tion to be unan&s;werably &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Emily, de&s;irous of concluding the conver&s;ation, inquired if her aunt would accept &s;ome refre&s;hment, and Madame Cheron ac|companied her to the chateau, but without de&s;i&s;ting from a topic, which &s;he di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with &s;o much complacency to her&s;elf, and &s;everity to her niece.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry to perceive, niece," &s;aid &s;he, in allu&s;ion to &s;ome|what that Emily had &s;aid, concerning phy&s;iognomy, "that you have a great many of your father's prejudices, and among them are tho&s;e &s;udden predilections for people from their looks. I can perceive that you imagine your&s;elf to be violently in love with this young adventurer, after an acquaintance of only a few days. There was &s;omething too, &s;o charmingly romantic in the manner of your meeting!"</P>
<P>Emily checked the tears that trembled in her eyes, while &s;he &s;aid, "When my conduct &s;hall de&s;erve this &s;everity, madam, you will do well to exerci&s;e it; till then ju&s;tice, if not tender|ne&s;s, &s;hould &s;urely re&s;train it. I have never willingly offended you; now I have lo&s;t my parents, you are the only per&s;on to whom I can look for kindne&s;s. Let me not lament more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> ever the lo&s;s of &s;uch parents." The la&s;t words were almo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by her emotions, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. Remembering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> delicacy and the tenderne&s;s of St. Aubert, the happy, happy days &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e &s;cenes, and contra&s;ting them with the coar&s;e and unfeeling behaviour of Madame Cheron, and with the future hours of mortification &s;he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to in her pre&s;ence; a degree of grief &s;eized her, that almo&s;t reached de&s;pair. Ma|dame Cheron, more offended by the reproof, which Emily's words conveyed, than touched by the &s;orrow they expre&s;&s;ed, &s;aid nothing, that might &s;often her grief; but, notwith&s;tanding as apparent reluctance to receive her niece, &s;he de&s;ired her company. The love of &s;way was her ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he knew it would be highly gratified by taking into her hou&s;e a young orphan, who had no appeal from her deci&s;ions, and on whom &s;he could exerci&s;e, without controul, the capricious humour of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>On entering the chateau, Madame Cheron expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire, that &s;he &s;hould put up what &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary to take to Tholou&s;e, as &s;he meant to &s;et off immediately. Emily now tried to per&s;uade her to defer the journey, at lea&s;t, till the next day, and, at length, with much difficulty, prevailed.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="029378_0059_0FE07EFF2B6498C8">
The day pa&s;&s;ed in the exerci&s;e of petty tyranny on the part of Ma|dame Cheron, and in mournful regret and melancholy anticipation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that of Emily, who, when her aunt retired to her apartment for the night, went to take leave of every other room in this her dear native home, which &s;he was now quitting, for &s;he knew not how long, and for a world, to which &s;he was wholly a &s;tranger. She could not conquer a pre&s;entiment, which frequently occurred to her, this night&mdash;that &s;he &s;hould never more return to La Vallee. Having pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable time in what had been her father's &s;tudy, having &s;elected &s;ome of his favourite authors, to put up with her clothes, and &s;hed many tears, as &s;he wiped the du&s;t from their covers, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf in his chair before the reading de&s;k, and &s;at lo&s;t in melancholy reflection, till There&s;a opened the door, to examine, as was her cu&s;tom before &s;he went to bed, if all was &s;afe. She &s;tarted, on ob&s;erving her young lady, who bade her come in, and then gave her &s;ome directions, for keeping the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in readine&s;s for her reception at all times.</P>
<P>"Alas-a-day! that you &s;hould leave it!" &s;aid There&s;a, "I think you would be happier here than where you are going, if one may judge." Emily made no reply to this remark; the &s;orrow There&s;a proceeded to expre&s;s at her departure affected her, but &s;he found &s;ome comfort in the &s;imple affection of this poor old &s;ervant, to whom &s;he gave &s;uch directions as might be&s;t conduce to her comfort, during her own ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed There&s;a to bed, Emily wandered through every lonely apartment of the chateau, lingering long in what had been her father's bed room, indulging melancholy, yet not unplea&s;ing emotions, and, having often returned within the door to take another look at it, &s;he withdrew to her own chamber. From her window &s;he gazed upon the garden below, &s;hewn faintly by the moon, ri&s;ing over the tops of the palm-trees, and, at length, the calm beauty of the night increa&s;ed a de&s;ire of indulging the mournful &s;weetne&s;s of bidding farewel to the beloved &s;hades of her childhood, till &s;he was tempted to de&s;cend. Throwing over her the light veil, in which &s;he u&s;ually walked, &s;he &s;ilently pa&s;&s;ed into the garden, and, ha&s;tening towards the di&s;tant groves, was glad to breathe once more the air of liberty, and to &s;igh unob|&s;erved. The deep repo&s;e of the &s;cene, the rich &s;cents, that floated on the breeze, the grandeur of the wide horizon and of the clear blue arch, &s;oothed, and gradually elevated her mind to that &s;u|blime complacency, which renders the vexations of this world &s;o in&s;ignificant and mean in our eyes, that we wonder they have had power for a moment to di&s;turb us. Emily forgot Madame Che|ron
<PB N="118" REF="029378_0060_0FE07F0CEB14FDE0">
and all the circum&s;tances of her conduct, while her thoughts a&s;cended to the contemplation of tho&s;e unnumbered worlds, that lie &s;cattered in the depths of aether, thou&s;ands of them hid from human eyes, and almo&s;t beyond the flight of human fancy. As her imagination &s;oared through the regions of &s;pace, and a&s;pired to that Great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, which pervades and governs all being, the idea of her father &s;carcely ever left her; but it was a plea&s;ing idea, &s;ince &s;he re&s;igned him to God in the full confidence of a pure and holy faith. She pur&s;ued her way through the groves to the terrace, often pau&s;ing as memory awakened the pang of affec|tion, and as rea&s;on anticipated the exile, into which &s;he was going.</P>
<P>And now the moon was high over the woods, touching their &s;ummits with yellow light, and darting between the foliage long level beams; while on the rapid Garonne below the trembling radiance was faintly ob&s;cured by the lighte&s;t vapour. Emily long watched the playing lu&s;tre, li&s;tened to the &s;oothing murmur of the current, and the yet lighter &s;ounds of the air, as it &s;tirred, at intervals, the lofty palm-trees. "How delightful is the &s;weet breath of the&s;e groves," &s;aid &s;he. "This lovely &s;cene!&mdash;how often &s;hall I remember and regret it, when I am far away. Alas! what events may occur, before I &s;ee it again! O, peaceful, hap|py &s;hades!&mdash;&s;cenes of my infant delights, of parental tenderne&s;s now lo&s;t for ever!&mdash;why mu&s;t I leave ye!&mdash;In your retreats I &s;hould &s;till find &s;afety and repo&s;e. Sweet hours of my childhood, I am now to leave even your la&s;t memorials! No objects, that would revive your impre&s;&s;ions, will remain for me!"</P>
<P>Then drying her tears and looking up, her thoughts ro&s;e again to the &s;ublime &s;ubject &s;he had contemplated; the &s;ame divine complacency &s;tole over her heart, and, hu&s;hing its throbs, in|&s;pired hope and confidence and re&s;ignation to the will of the Deity, who&s;e works filled her mind with adoration.</P>
<P>Emily gazed long on the plane-tree, and then &s;eated her&s;elf, for the la&s;t time, on the bench under its &s;hade, where &s;he had &s;o often &s;at with her parents, and where, only a few hours before, &s;he had conver&s;ed with Valancourt, at the remembrance of whom, thus revived, a mingled &s;en&s;ation of e&s;teem, tenderne&s;s and anxiety ro&s;e in her brea&s;t. With this remembrance occur|red a recollection of his late confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;that he had often wan|dered near her habitation in the night, having even pa&s;&s;ed the boundary of the garden, and it immediately occurred to her, that he might be at this moment in the grounds. The fear of meet|ing him, particularly after the declaration he had made, and of incurring a cen&s;ure, which her aunt might &s;o rea&s;onably be&s;tow,

if it was known, that &s;he was met by her lover, at this hour, made her in&s;tantly leave her beloved plane-tree, and walk to|wards the chateau. She ca&s;t an anxious eye around, and often &s;topped for a moment to examine the &s;hadowy &s;cene before &s;he ventured to proceed, but &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on without perceiving any per&s;on, till having reached a clump of almond trees, not far from the hou&s;e, &s;he re&s;ted to take a retro&s;pect of the garden, and to &s;igh forth another adieu. As her eyes wandered over the land&s;cape &s;he thought &s;he perceived a per&s;on emerge from the groves, and pa&s;s &s;lowly along a moonlight alley that led between them; but the di&s;tance, and the imperfect light would not &s;uffer her to judge with any degree of certainty whether this was fancy or reality. She continued to gaze for &s;ometime on the &s;pot, till on the dead &s;tillne&s;s of the air &s;he heard a &s;udden &s;ound, and in the next in&s;tant fancied &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed foot&s;teps near her. Wa&s;ting not another moment in conjecture, &s;he hur|ried to the chateau, and, having reached it, retired to her cham|ber, where, as &s;he clo&s;ed her window &s;he looked upon the gar|den, and then again thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed a figure, gliding between the almond trees &s;he had ju&s;t left.

<P>AT an early hour, the carriage, which was to take Emily and Madame Cheron to Tholou&s;e, appeared at the door of the chateau, and Madame was already in the breakfa&s;t-room, when her niece entered it. The repa&s;t was &s;ilent and melancholy on the part of Emily; and Madame Cheron, who&s;e vanity was piqued on ob&s;erving her dejection, reproved her in a manner that did not contribute to remove it. It was with much re|luctance, that Emily's reque&s;t to take with her the dog, which had been a favourite of her father, was granted. Her aunt, im|patient
<PB N="120" REF="029378_0061_0FE07F13102BA218">
to be gone, ordered the carriage to draw up; and, while &s;he pa&s;&s;ed to the hall door. Emily gave another look into the library, and another farewel glance over the garden, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> followed. Old There&s;a &s;tood at the door to take leave of her young lady. "God for ever keep you, ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid &s;he, while Emily gave her hand in &s;ilence, and could an&s;wer only with a pre&s;&s;ure of her hand, and a forced &s;mile.</P>
<P>At the gate, which led out of the grounds, &s;everal of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> father's pen&s;ioners were a&s;&s;embled to bid her farewel, to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;he would have &s;poken if her aunt would have &s;uffered the dri|ver to &s;top; and, having di&s;tributed to them almo&s;t all the mo|ney &s;he had about her, &s;he &s;unk back in the carriage, yielding to the melancholy of her heart. Soon after, &s;he caught, between the &s;teep banks of the road, another view of the chateau, peeping from among the high trees, and &s;urrounded by green &s;lopes and tufted groves, the Garonne winding its way beneath their &s;hades, &s;ometimes lo&s;t among the vineyards, and then ri&s;ing in greater maje&s;ty in the di&s;tant pa&s;tures. The towering precipices of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Pyrenees, that ro&s;e to the &s;outh, gave Emily a thou&s;and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|e&s;ting recollections of her late journey; and the&s;e objects of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e|former enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration, now excited only &s;orrow and re|gret. Having gazed on the chateau and its lovely &s;cenery, till the banks again clo&s;ed upon them, her mind became too much occu|pied by mournful reflections, to permit her to attend to the con|ver&s;ation, which Madame Cheron had begun on &s;ome trivial topic, &s;o that they &s;oon travelled in profound &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Valancourt, meanwhile was returned to E&s;tuviere, his heart occupied with the image of Emily; &s;ometimes indulging in reveries of future happine&s;s, but more frequently &s;hrink|ing with dread of the oppo&s;ition he might encounter from her family. He was the younger &s;on of an ancient family of Ga&s;|cony; and, having lo&s;t his parents at an early period of his life, the care of his education and of his &s;mall portion had devolved to his brother, the Count de Duvarney, his &s;enior by nearly twen|ty years. Valancourt had been educated in all the accompli&s;h|ments of his age, and had an ardour of &s;pirit, and a certain grandeur of mind, that gave him particular excellence in the ex|erci&s;es then thought heroic. His little fortune had been dimin|i&s;hed by the nece&s;&s;ary expences of his education; but M. La Valancourt, the elder, &s;eemed to think, that his genius and ac|compli&s;hments would amply &s;upply the deficiency of his inheri|tance.

gentleman could engage without incurring a &s;tain on his name; and La Valancourt was of cour&s;e enrolled in the army. The general genius of his mind was but little under&s;tood by his brother. That ardour, for whatever is great and good in the moral world, as well as in the natural one, di&s;played it&s;elf in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> years; and the &s;trong indignation, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e felt and ex|pre&s;&s;ed at a criminal or a mean action, &s;ometimes drew upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the di&s;plea&s;ure of his tutor; who reprobated it under the general term of violence of temper; and who, when harranguing on the virtues of mildne&s;s and moderation, &s;eemed to forget the gentlene&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, which always appeared in his pupil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> objects of misfortune.</P>
<P>He had now obtained leave of ab&s;ence from his regiment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he made the excur&s;ion into the Pyrenees, which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of introducing him to St. Aubert; and, as this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> nearly expired, he was the more anxious to declare him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emily's family, from whom he rea&s;onably apprehended oppo|&s;ition, &s;ince his fortune, though, with a moderate addition from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it would be &s;ufficient to &s;upport them, would not &s;atisfy the views, either of vanity or ambition. Valancourt was not without the latter, but he &s;aw golden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of promotion in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and believed, that with Emily he could, in the mean|time, be delighted to live within the limits of his humble in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me. His thoughts were now occupied in con&s;idering the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of making him&s;elf known to her family, to whom, how|ever, be had yet no addre&s;s, for he was intirely ignorant of Em|ily's precipitate departure from La Vallee, of whom he hoped to obtain it.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the travellers pur&s;ued their journey; Emily mak|ing frequent efforts to appear cheerful, and too often relap&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ilence and dejection. Madame Cheron, attributing her melancholy &s;olely to the circum&s;tance of her being removed to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from her lover, and believing, that the &s;orrow, which her niece &s;till expre&s;&s;ed for the lo&s;s of St. Aubert, proceeded partly from an affectation of &s;en&s;ibility, endeavoured to make it appear ridiculous to her, that &s;uch deep regret &s;hould continue to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o long after the period u&s;ually allowed for grief.</P>
<P>At length, the&s;e unplea&s;ant lectures were interrupted by the arrival of the travellers at Tholou&s;e; and Emily, who had not been there for many years, and had only a very faint recollection of it&punc; was &s;urpri&s;ed at the o&s;tentatious &s;tyle exhibited in her aunt's hou&s;e and furniture; the more &s;o, perhaps, becau&s;e it was &s;o totally different from the mode&s;t elegance, to which &s;he had been

accu&s;tomed. She followed Madame Cheron through a large hall, where &s;everal &s;ervants in rich liveries appeared, to a kind of &s;aloon, fitted up with more &s;hew than ta&s;te; and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> complaining of fatigue, ordered &s;upper immediately. "I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> glad to find my&s;elf in my own hou&s;e again," &s;aid &s;he, throwing her&s;elf on a large &s;ettee, "and to have my own people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me.

What makes you &s;o &s;ilent, child?&mdash;What is it that di&s;turbs you now?"</P>
<P>Emily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;tarting tear, and tried to &s;mile away the expre&s;&s;ion of an oppre&s;&s;ed heart; &s;he was thinking of <HI>her</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and felt too &s;en&s;ibly the arrogance and o&s;tentatious vanity of Madame Cheron's conver&s;ation. "Can this be my father's &s;i&s;|ter!" &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf; and then the conviction that &s;he was &s;o, warming her heart with &s;omething like kindne&s;s towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he felt anxious to &s;often the har&s;h impre&s;&s;ion her mind had re|ceived of her aunt's character, and to &s;hew a willingne&s;s to oblige her. The effort did not intirely fail; &s;he li&s;tened with appa|rent cheerfulne&s;s, while Madame Cheron expatiated on the &s;plen|dour of her hou&s;e, told of the numerous parties &s;he entertained, and what &s;he &s;hould expect of Emily, who&s;e diffidence a&s;&s;umed the air of a re&s;erve, which her aunt, believing it to be that of pride and ignorance united, now took occa&s;ion to reprehend. She knew nothing of the conduct of a mind, that fears to tru&s;t its own powers; which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a nice judgment, and incl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing to believe, that every other per&s;on perceives &s;till more critically, fears to commit it&s;elf to cen&s;ure, and &s;eeks &s;helter in the ob&s;cur|ity of &s;ilence. Emily had frequently blu&s;hed at the fearle&s;s manners, which &s;he had &s;een admired, and the brilliant nothings, which &s;he had heard applauded; yet this applau&s;e, &s;o far from encouraging her to imitate the conduct that had won it, rather made her &s;hrink into the re&s;erve, that would protect her from &s;uch ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron looked on her niece's diffidence with a feeling very near to contempt, and endeavoured to overcome it by reproof, rather than to encourage it by gentlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The entrance of &s;upper &s;omewhat interrupted the complacent di&s;cour&s;e of Madame Cheron and the painful con&s;iderations, which it had forced upon Emily. When the repa&s;t, which was rendered o&s;tentatious by the attendance of a great number of &s;er|vants, and by a profu&s;ion of plate, was over, Madame Cheron re|tired to her chamber, and a female &s;ervant came to &s;hew Emily

Having pa&s;&s;ed up a large &s;tairca&s;e, and through &s;everal galleries, they came to a flight of back &s;tairs, which led into a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age in a remote part of the chateau, and there the &s;er|vant opened the door of a &s;mall chamber, which &s;he &s;aid was Ma'am&s;elle Emily's, who once more alone, indulged the tears &s;he had long tried to re&s;train.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who know, from experience, how much the heart be|comes attached even to inanimate objects, to which it has been long accu&s;tomed, how unwillingly it re&s;igns them; how with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of an old friend it meets them, after temporary ab&s;ence, will under&s;tand the forlornne&s;s of Emily's feelings, of Emily &s;hut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the only home &s;he had known from her infancy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon a &s;cene, and among per&s;ons, di&s;agreeable for more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than their novelty.

Her heart pointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her peaceful home&mdash;to the neighbourhood where Valancourt was&mdash;where St. Aubert had been; and her imagination, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the veil of di&s;tance, brought that home to her eyes in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|tere&s;ting and romantic beauty.

<P>Emily, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked, had &s;carcely power to beg an explanation of the&s;e words, and when &s;he did, her aunt ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give it, though, by her &s;evere looks, and half &s;entences, &s;he appeared anxious to impre&s;s Emily with a be|lief, that &s;he was well informed of &s;ome degrading circum&s;tances of her conduct.

<P>She was now informed, that a large party were expected to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, on which account Madame Cheron repeated the le&s;&s;on of the preceding night, concerning her conduct in company, and Emily wi&s;hed, that &s;he might have courage enough to practi&s;e it.

<P>When the company arrived, Emily entered the &s;aloon with an air of timidity, which all her efforts could not overcome, and which was increa&s;ed by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Madame Cheron's &s;evere ob&s;ervation. Her mourning dre&s;s, the mild dejection of her beautiful countenance, and the retiring diffidence of her manner, rendered her a very intere&s;ting object to many of the company; among whom &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed Signor Montoni, and his friend Cavigni, the late vi&s;itors at M. Que&s;nel's who now &s;eemed to conver&s;e with Madame Cheron with the familiarity of old acquaintance, and &s;he to attend to them with particular plea&s;ure.

This Signor Montoni had an air of con&s;cious &s;uperiority, an|imated by &s;pirit, and &s;trengthened by talents, to which every per&s;on &s;eemed involuntarily to yield.

Before &s;he &s;aw Valancourt &s;he had never met a mind and ta&s;te <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with her own, and, though Madame Cheron told her much of the arts of di&s;&s;imula|tion, and that the elegance and propriety of thought, which &s;he &s;o much admired in her lover, were a&s;&s;umed for the purpo&s;e of plea&s;ing her, &s;he could &s;carcely doubt their truth. This po&s;&s;ibil|ity, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aint as it was, was &s;ufficient to hara&s;s her mind with anxiety; and &s;he found, that few conditions are more pain|ful than that of uncertainty, as to the merit of a beloved object; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> uncertainty which &s;he would not have &s;uffered, had her con|fidence in her own opinions been greater.</P>
<P>She was awakened from her mu&s;ing by the &s;ound of hor&s;es' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> a road, that wound under the windows of the pavil|ion, and a gentleman pa&s;&s;ed on hor&s;eback, who&s;e re&s;emblance to

Valancourt, in air and figure, for the twilight did not permit a view of his features, immediately &s;truck her. She retired ha&s;ti|ly from the lattice, fearing to be &s;een, yet wi&s;hing to ob&s;erve further, while the &s;tranger pa&s;&s;ed on without looking up, and, when &s;he returned to the lattice, &s;he &s;aw him faintly through the twilight, winding under the high trees, that led to Tholou&s;e. This little incident &s;o much di&s;turbed her &s;pirits, that the tem|ple and its &s;cenery were no longer intere&s;ting to her, and, after walking awhile on the terrace, &s;he returned to the chateau.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron, whether &s;he had &s;een a rival admired, had lo&s;t at play, or had witne&s;&s;ed an entertainment more &s;plendid than her own, was returned from her vi&s;it with a temper more than u&s;ually di&s;compo&s;ed; and Emily was glad, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> arrived, in which &s;he could retire to the &s;olitude of her own apartment.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;he was &s;ummoned to Madame Cheron, who&s;e countenance was inflamed with re&s;entment, and, as Emily advanced, &s;he held out a letter to her.</P>
<P>"Do you know this hand?" &s;aid &s;he, in a &s;evere tone, and with a look that was intended to &s;earch her heart, while Emily ex|amined the letter attentively, and a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he did not.</P>
<P>"Do not provoke me," &s;aid her aunt; "you do know it, confe&s;s the truth immediately. I in&s;i&s;t upon your confe&s;&s;ing the truth in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;ilent, and turned to leave the room, but Madame called her back. "O you are guilty then," &s;aid &s;he, "you do know the hand." "If you was before in doubt of this, ma|dam," replied Emily calmly, "why did you accu&s;e me of hav|ing told a fal&s;ehood." Madame Cheron did not blu&s;h; but her niece did, a moment after, when &s;he heard the name of Valan|court. It was not, however, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving reproof, for, if &s;he ever had &s;een his hand-writing, the pre&s;ent characters did not bring it to her recollection.</P>
<P>"It is u&s;ele&s;s to deny it," &s;aid Madame Cheron, "I &s;ee in your countenance, that you are no &s;tranger to this letter; and I dare &s;ay, you have received many &s;uch from this impertinent young man, without my knowledge, in my own hou&s;e."</P>
<P>Emily, &s;hocked at the indelicacy of this accu&s;ation, &s;till more than by the vulgarity of the former, in&s;tantly forgot the pride, that had impo&s;ed &s;ilence, and endeavoured to vindicate her&s;elf from the a&s;per&s;ion, but Madame Cheron was not to be convinced.</P>
<P>"I cannot &s;uppo&s;e," &s;he re&s;umed, "that this young man would have taken the liberty of writing to me, if you had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="129" REF="029378_0065_0FE07F3CA50128E8">
encouraged him to do &s;o, and I mu&s;t now"&mdash;"You will allow me to remind you, madam," &s;aid Emily timidly, "of &s;ome par|ticulars of a conver&s;ation we had at La Vallee. I then told you truly, that I had only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> forbade Mon&s;ieur Valancourt from ad|dre&s;&s;ing my family."</P>
<P>"I will not be interrupted," &s;aid Madame Cheron, interrupt|ing her niece, "I was going to &s;ay&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have forgot what I was going to &s;ay. But how happened it that you did not forbid him?" Emily was &s;ilent. "How happened it that you en|couraged him to trouble me with this letter? A young man that nobody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; an utter &s;tranger in the place, a young adven|turer, no doubt, who is looking out for a good fortune. How|ever, on that point he has mi&s;taken his aim."</P>
<P>"His family was known to my father," &s;aid Emily mode&s;tly; and without appearing to be &s;en&s;ible of the la&s;t &s;entence.</P>
<P>"O! that is no recommendation at all," replied her aunt, with her u&s;ual readine&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon this topic; "he took &s;uch &s;trange fancies to people! He was always judging per&s;ons by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and was continually deceived." "Yet it was but now, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that you judged me guilty by my countenance," &s;aid Em|ily, with a de&s;ign of reproving Madame Cheron, to which &s;he was induced by this di&s;re&s;pectful mention of her father.</P>
<P>"I called you here," re&s;umed her aunt, colouring, "to tell you, that I will not be di&s;turbed in my own hou&s;e by any let|ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, or vi&s;its from young men, who may take a fancy to flatter you. This M. de Valentine&mdash;I think you call him, has the im|pertinence to beg I will permit him to pay his re&s;pects to me! I &s;hall &s;end him a proper an&s;wer.

<P>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> madam," &s;aid Emily, bur&s;ting into tears, and over|come by the rude &s;u&s;picions her aunt had expre&s;&s;ed, "how have I de&s;erved the&s;e reproofs?" She could &s;ay no more; and &s;o very fear|ful was &s;he of acting with any degree of impropriety in the affair it&s;elf, that; at the pre&s;ent moment, Madame Cheron might perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prevailed with her to bind her&s;elf by a promi&s;e to renounce Valancourt for ever. Her mind, weakened by her terrors, would no longer &s;uffer her to view him as &s;he had formerly done; &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the error of her own judgment, not that of Madame Che|ron, and feared al&s;o, that, in her former conver&s;ation with him at La Vallee, &s;he had nor conducted her&s;elf with &s;ufficient re&s;erve.
<PB N="130" REF="029378_0066_0FE07F49492775C8">
She knew, that &s;he did not de&s;erve the coar&s;e &s;u&s;picions, which her aunt had thrown out, but a thou&s;and &s;cruples ro&s;e to torment her, &s;uch as would never have di&s;turbed the peace of Madame Cheron. Thus rendered anxious to avoid every opportunity of erring, and willing to &s;ubmit to any re&s;trictions that her aunt &s;hould think proper, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed an obedience, to which Mad|ame Cheron did not give much confidence, and which &s;he &s;eem|ed to con&s;ider as the con&s;equence of either fear, or artifice.</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid &s;he, "promi&s;e me that you will neither &s;ee this young man, nor write to him without my con&s;ent." "Dear, madam," replied Emily, "can you &s;uppo&s;e I would do either unknown to you!" "I don't know what to &s;uppo&s;e; there is no knowing how young women will act. It is difficult to place any confidence in them, for they have &s;eldom &s;en&s;e enough to wi&s;h for the re&s;pect of the world."</P>
<P>"Alas, madam!" &s;aid Emily, "I am anxious for my own re|&s;pect; my father taught me the value of that; he &s;aid if I de|&s;erved my own e&s;teem, that of the world would follow of cour&s;e."</P>
<P>"My brother was a good kind of a man," replied Madame Cheron, "but he did not know the world. I am &s;ure I have always felt a proper re&s;pect for my&s;elf, yet&mdash;" She &s;topped, but &s;he might have added, that the world had not always &s;hewn re&s;pect to her, and this without impeaching its judgment.</P>
<P>"Well!" re&s;umed Madame Cheron, "you have not given me the promi&s;e, though, that I demand." Emily readily gave it, and, being then &s;uffered to withdraw, &s;he walked in the garden; tried to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, and, at length, arrived at her favourite pavilion at the end of the terrace, where, &s;eating her&s;elf at one of the embowered windows, that opened upon a balcony, the &s;till|ne&s;s and &s;eclu&s;ion of the &s;cene allowed her to recollect her thoughts, and to arrange them &s;o as to form a clearer judgment of her former conduct. She endeavoured to review with exactne&s;s all the particulars of her conver&s;ation with Valancourt at La Val|lee, had the &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve nothing that could alarm her delicate pride, and thus to be confirmed in the &s;elf e&s;teem, which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to her peace. Her mind then became tranquil, and &s;he &s;aw Valancourt amiable and intelligent, as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> had for|merly appeared, and Madame Cheron neither the one, or the other. The remembrance of her lover, however, brought with it many very painful emotions, for it by no means reconciled her to the thought of re&s;igning him; and, Madame Cheron hav|ing already &s;hewn how highly &s;he di&s;approved of the attachment, &s;he fore&s;aw much &s;uffering from the oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts; yet
<PB N="131" REF="029378_0066_0FE07F49492775C8">
with all this was mingled a degree of delight, which, in &s;pite of rea&s;on, partook of hope. She determined, however, that no con|&s;ideration &s;hould induce her to permit a clande&s;tine corre&s;pon|dence, and to ob&s;erve in her conver&s;ation with Valancourt, &s;hould they ever meet again, the &s;ame nicety of re&s;erve, which had hitherto marked her conduct. As &s;he repeated the words&mdash;"&s;hould we ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> meet again!" &s;he &s;hrunk as if this was a cir|cum&s;tance, which had never before occurred to her, and tears came to her eyes, which &s;he ha&s;tily dried, for &s;he heard foot&s;teps approaching, and then the door of the pavilion open, and, on turning, &s;he &s;aw&mdash;Valancourt. An emotion of mingled plea&s;ure, &s;urpri&s;e and apprehen&s;ion pre&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;uddenly upon her heart as almo&s;t to overcome her &s;pirits; the colour left her cheeks, then returned brighter than before, and &s;he was for a moment unable to &s;peak, or to ri&s;e from her chair. His countenance was the mirror, in which &s;he &s;aw her own emotions reflected, and it rou&s;ed her to &s;elf command. The joy which had animated his features, when he entered the pavilion, was &s;uddenly repre&s;&s;ed, as, approaching, he perceived her agitation, and, in a tremulous voice, inquired after her health. Recovered from her fir&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e, &s;he an&s;wered him with a tempered &s;mile; but a variety of oppo&s;ite emotions &s;till a&s;&s;ailed her heart, and &s;truggled to &s;ub|due the mild dignity of her manner. It was difficult to tell which predominated&mdash;the joy of &s;eeing Valancourt, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of her aunt's di&s;plea&s;ure, when &s;he &s;hould hear of this meeting. After &s;ome &s;hort and embarra&s;&s;ed conver&s;ation, &s;he led him into the gardens, and inquired if he had &s;een Madame Cheron." "No," &s;aid he, "I have not yet &s;een her, for they told me &s;he was engaged, and as &s;oon as I learned that you were in the gar|dens, I came hither." He pau&s;ed a moment in great agitation, and then added, "May I venture to tell you the purport of my vi&s;it, without incurring your di&s;plea&s;ure, and to hope, that you will not accu&s;e me of precipitation in now availing my&s;elf of the permi&s;&s;ion you once gave me of addre&s;&s;ing your family?" Emi|ly, who knew not what to reply, was &s;pared from further per|plexity, and was &s;en&s;ible only of fear, when, on rai&s;ing her eyes, &s;he &s;aw Madame Cheron turn into the avenue. As the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of innocence returned, this fear was &s;o far di&s;&s;ipated as to permit her to appear tranquil, and, in&s;tead of avoiding her aunt, &s;he advanced with Valancourt to meet her. The look of haugh|ty and impatient di&s;plea&s;ure, with which Madame Cheron re|garded them, made Emily &s;hrink, who under&s;tood from a &s;ingle glance, that this meeting was believed to have been more
<PB N="132" REF="029378_0067_0FE07F4F3B6BD678">
than accidental: having mentioned Valancourt's name, &s;he be|came again too much agitated to remain with them, and return|ed into the chateau; where &s;he awaited long, in a &s;tate of trem|bling anxiety, the conclu&s;ion of the conference. She knew not how to account for Valancourt's vi&s;it to her aunt, before he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> received the permi&s;&s;ion he &s;olicited, &s;ince &s;he was ignorant of a circum&s;tance, which would have rendered the reque&s;t u&s;ele&s;s, even if Madame Cheron had been inclined to grant it. Valan|court, in the agitation of his &s;pirits, had forgotten to date his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for Madame Cheron to return <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;wer; and, when he recollected this circum&s;tance, he was, per|haps, not &s;o &s;orry for the omi&s;&s;ion, as glad of the excu&s;e it allow|ed him for waiting on her before &s;he could &s;end a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron had a long conver&s;ation with Valancourt, and, when &s;he returned to the chateau, her countenance expre&s;|&s;ed ill humour, but not the degree of &s;everity, which Emily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> apprehended. "I have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed this young man, at la&s;t," &s;aid &s;he, "and I hope my hou&s;e will never again be di&s;turbed with &s;imilar vi&s;its. He a&s;&s;ures me, that your interview was not pre|concerted."</P>
<P>"Dear madam!" &s;aid Emily in extreme emotion, "you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> did not a&s;k him the que&s;tion!" "Mo&s;t certainly I did; you could not &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould be &s;o imprudent as to neglect it."</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, "what an opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> form of me, &s;ince you Madam, could expre&s;s a &s;u&s;picion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ill conduct!"</P>
<P>"It is of very little con&s;equence what opinion he may form of you," replied her aunt, "for I have put an end to the affair; but I believe he will not form a wor&s;e opinion of me for my prudent conduct. I let him &s;ee, that I was not to be trifled with; and that I had more delicacy, than to permit any clan|de&s;tine corre&s;pondence to be carried on in my hou&s;e."</P>
<P>Emily had frequently heard Madame Cheron u&s;e the word de|licacy, but, &s;he was now more than u&s;ually perplexed to under|&s;tand how &s;he meant to apply it in this in&s;tance, in which her whole conduct appeared to merit the very rever&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>"It was very incon&s;iderate of my brother," re&s;umed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Cheron, "to leave the trouble of overlooking your conduct to me; I wi&s;h you was well &s;ettled in life. But if I find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> am to be further troubled with &s;uch vi&s;itors as this M. Valan|court, I &s;hall place you in a convent at once;&mdash;&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the alternative. This young man has the impertinence to own to me,&mdash;he owns it! that his fortune is very &s;mall, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">
<PB N="133" REF="029378_0067_0FE07F4F3B6BD678">
is chiefly dependent on an elder brother and on the profe&s;&s;ion he has cho&s;en! He &s;hould have concealed the&s;e circum&s;tances, at lea&s;t, if he expected to &s;ucceed with me. Had he the pre&s;ump|tion to &s;uppo&s;e I would marry my niece to a per&s;on &s;uch as he de&s;cribes him&s;elf!"</P>
<P>Emily dried her tears when &s;he heard of the candid confe&s;&s;ion of Valancourt; and though the circum&s;tances it di&s;covered were afflicting to her hopes, his artle&s;s conduct gave her a degree of plea&s;ure, that overcame every other emotion. But &s;he was com|pelled, even thus early in life, to ob&s;erve, that good &s;en&s;e and noble integrity are not always &s;ufficient to cope with folly and narrow cunning; and her heart was pure enough to allow her, even at this trying moment, to look with more pride on the de|feat of the former, than with mortification on the conque&s;ts of the latter.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron pur&s;ued her triumph.&mdash;"He has al&s;o thought proper to tell me, that he will receive his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from no per&s;on but your&s;elf; this favour, however, I have ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed him. He &s;hall learn, that it is quite &s;ufficient, that I di&s;|approve him. And I take this opportunity of repeating,&mdash;that if you concert any means of interview unknown to me, you &s;hall leave my hou&s;e immediately."</P>
<P>"How little do you know me, madam, that you &s;hould think &s;uch an injunction nece&s;&s;ary!" &s;aid Emily, trying to &s;uppre&s;s her emotion "how little of the dear parents who educated me!"</P>
<P>Madame Cheron now went to dre&s;s for an engagment, which &s;he had made for the evening; and Emily, who would gladly have been excu&s;ed from attending her aunt, did not a&s;k to re|main at home le&s;t her reque&s;t &s;hould be attributed to an impro|per motive. When &s;he retired to her own room, the little for|titude, which had &s;upported her in the pre&s;ence of her relation, for&s;ook her; &s;he remembered only that Valancourt, who&s;e char|acter appeared more amiable from every circum&s;tance, that un|folded it, was bani&s;hed from her pre&s;ence, perhaps, for ever, and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the time in weeping, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ording to her aunt's direction, &s;he ought to have employed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n dre&s;&s;ing. This im|portant duty was, however, quickly di&s;patched; though, when &s;he joined Madame Cheron at table, her eyes betrayed, that &s;he had been in tears, and drew upon her a &s;evere reproof.</P>
<P>Her efforts to appear cheerful did not intirely fail when &s;he joined the company at the hou&s;e of Madame Clairval, an elderly widow lady, who had lately come to re&s;ide at Tholou&s;e, on an e&s;tate of her late hu&s;band. She had lived many years at Paris
<PB N="134" REF="029378_0068_0FE07F5D773112F8">
in a &s;plendid &s;tyle; had naturally a gay temper, and &s;ince her re&s;idence at Tholou&s;e, had given &s;ome of the mo&s;t magnificent entertainments, that had been &s;een in that neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e excited not only the envy, but the trifling ambition of Madame Cheron, who, &s;ince &s;he could not rival the &s;plendour of her fe&s;tivities, was de&s;irous of being ranked in the number of her mo&s;t intimate friends. For this purpo&s;e &s;he paid her the mo&s;t ob&s;equious attention, and made a point of being di&s;engaged, whenever &s;he received an invitation from Madame Clairval, of whom &s;he talked, wherever &s;he went, and derived much &s;elf-con|&s;equence from impre&s;&s;ing a belief on her general acquaintance, that they were on the mo&s;t familiar footing.</P>
<P>The entertainments of this evening con&s;i&s;ted of a ball and &s;up|per; it was a fancy ball, and the company danced in groups in the gardens, which were very exten&s;ive. The high and luxuri|ant trees, under which the groups a&s;&s;embled, were illuminated with a profu&s;ion of lamps, di&s;po&s;ed with ta&s;te and fancy. The gay and various dre&s;&s;es of the company, &s;ome of whom were &s;eated on the turf, conver&s;ing at their ea&s;e, ob&s;erving the cotil|lons, taking refre&s;hments, and &s;ometimes touching &s;portively a guitar; the gallant manners of the gentlemen, the exqui&s;itely capricious air of the ladies; the light fanta&s;tic &s;teps of their dances; the mu&s;icians with the lute, the hautboy, and the ta|bor, &s;eated at the foot of an elm, and the &s;ylvan &s;cenery of woods around, were circum&s;tances, that tunitedly formed a char|acteri&s;tic and &s;triking picture of French fe&s;tivity. Emily &s;ur|veyed the gaiety of the &s;cene with a melancholy kind of plea&s;ure, and her emotion may be imagined when, as &s;he &s;tood with her aunt, looking at one of the groups, &s;he perceived Valancourt; &s;aw him dancing with a young and beautiful lady, &s;aw him con|ver&s;ing with her with a mixture of attention and familiarity, &s;uch as &s;he had &s;eldom ob&s;erved in his manner. She turned ha&s;tily from the &s;cene, and attempted to draw away Madame Cheron, who was conver&s;ing with Signor Cavigni, and neither perceived Valancourt, or was willing to be interrupted. A faint|ne&s;s &s;uddenly came over Emily, and, unable to &s;upport her&s;elf, &s;he &s;at down on a turf bank beneath the trees, where &s;everal other per&s;ons were &s;eated. One of the&s;e, ob&s;erving the extreme palene&s;s of her countenance, inquired if &s;he was ill, and begged &s;he would allow him to fetch her a gla&s;s of water, for which po|litene&s;s &s;he thanked him, but did not accept it. Her apprehen|&s;ion le&s;t Valancourt &s;hould ob&s;erve her emotion made her anxious to overcome it, and &s;he &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to recompo&s;e her

countenance. Madame Cheron was &s;till conver&s;ing with Cavig|ni; and the Count Bauvillers, who had addre&s;&s;ed Emily, made &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the &s;cene, to which &s;he an&s;wered almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, for her mind was &s;till occupied with the idea of Valancourt, to whom it was with extreme unea&s;ine&s;s that &s;he remained &s;o near. Some remarks, however, which the Count made upon the dance obliged her to turn her eyes towards it, and, at that moment, Valancourt's met hers. Her colour faded again, &s;he felt that &s;he was relap&s;ing into faintne&s;s, and in&s;tantly averted her looks, but not before &s;he had ob&s;erved the altered countenance of Valancourt, on perceiving her. She would have left the &s;pot immediately, had &s;he not been con&s;cious, that this conduct would have &s;hewn him more obviou&s;ly the intere&s;t he held in her heart; and, having tried to attend to the Count's conver&s;ation and to join in it, &s;he, at length, recovered her &s;pi|rits. But, when he made &s;ome ob&s;ervation on Valancourt's partner, the fear of &s;hewing, that &s;he was intere&s;ted in the re|mark, would have betrayed it to him, had not the Count, while he &s;poke, looked towards the per&s;on of whom he was &s;peaking. "The lady," &s;aid he, "dancing with that young chevalier, who appears to be accompli&s;hed in every thing, but in dancing, is ranked among the beauties of Tholou&s;e. She is hand&s;ome, and her fortune will be very large. I hope &s;he will make a better choice in a partner for life than &s;he has done in a partner for the dance, for I ob&s;erve he has ju&s;t put the &s;et into great confu&s;ion; he does nothing but commit blunders. I am &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that, with his air and figure, he has not taken more care to accompli&s;h him&s;elf in dancing."</P>
<P>Emily, who&s;e heart trembled at every word, that was now ut|tered, endeavoured to turn the conver&s;ation from Valancourt, by inquiring the name of the lady, with whom he danced; but, before the Count could reply, the dance concluded, and Emily, perceiving that Valancourt was coming towards her, ro&s;e and joined Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>"Here is the Chevalier Valancourt, madam," &s;aid &s;he in a whi&s;per, "pray let us go." Her aunt immediately moved on, but not before Valancourt had reached them, who bowed lowly to Madame Cheron, and with an earne&s;t and dejected look to Emily, with whom, notwith&s;tanding all her effort, an air of more than common re&s;erve prevailed. The pre&s;ence of Madame Che|ron prevented Valancourt from remaining, and he pa&s;&s;ed on with a countenance, who&s;e melancholy reproached her for having in|crea&s;ed it. Emily was called from the mu&s;ing fit, into which &s;he had fallen, by the Count Bauvillers, who was known to her aunt.
<PB N="136" REF="029378_0069_0FE07F626070BBB8">
"I have your pardon to beg, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid he, "for a rude|ne&s;s, which you will readily believe was quite unintentional.&mdash;I did not know, that the Chevalier was your acquaintance, when I &s;o freely critici&s;ed his dancing." Emily blu&s;hed and &s;miled, and Madame Cheron &s;pared her the difficulty of replying. "If you mean the per&s;on, who has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed us," &s;aid &s;he, "I can a&s;&s;ure you he is no acquaintance of either mine, or ma'am&s;elle St. Aubert's: I know nothing of him."</P>
<P>"O! that is the chevalier Valancourt," &s;aid Cavigni care|le&s;sly and looking back. "You know him then?" &s;aid Mad|ame Cheron. "I am not acquainted with him," replied Cav|igni. "You don't know, then, the rea&s;on I have to call him impertinent;&mdash;he has had the pre&s;umption to admire my niece!"</P>
<P>"If every man de&s;erves the title of impertinent, who admires ma'am&s;elle St. Aubert," replied Cavigni, "I fear there are a great many impertinents, and I am willing to acknowledge my|&s;elf one of the number."</P>
<P>"O &s;ignor!" &s;aid Madame Cheron, with an affected &s;mile, "I perceive you have learnt the art of complimenting, &s;ince you came into France. But it is cruel to compliment children, &s;ince they mi&s;take flattery for truth."</P>
<P>Cavigni turned away his face for a moment, and then &s;aid with a &s;tudied air, "Whom then are we to compliment, mad|am? for it would be ab&s;urd to compliment a woman of refined under&s;tanding; <HI>&s;he</HI> is above all prai&s;e." As he fini&s;hed the &s;en|tence he gave Emily a &s;ly look, and the &s;mile that had lurked in his eye, &s;tole forth. She perfectly under&s;tood it, and blu&s;hed for Madame Cheron, who replied, "You are perfectly right, &s;ignor, no woman of under&s;tanding can endure compliment."</P>
<P>"I have heard &s;ignor Montoni &s;ay," rejoined Cavigni, "that he never knew but one woman who de&s;erved it."</P>
<P>"Well!" exclaimed Madame Cheron, with a &s;hort laugh, and a &s;mile of unutterable complacency, "and who could &s;he be?"</P>
<P>"O!" replied Cavigni, "it is impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take her, for certainly there is not more than one woman in the world, who has both the merit to de&s;erve compliment and the wit to refu&s;e it. Mo&s;t women rever&s;e the ca&s;e intirely." He looked again at Emily, who blu&s;hed deeper than before for her aunt, and turned from him with di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Well, &s;ignor!" &s;aid Madame Cheron, "I prote&s;t you are a Frenchman; I never heard a foreigner &s;ay any thing half &s;o gallant as that!"</P>
<P>"True, madam," &s;aid the Count, who had been &s;ometime &s;ilent, and with a low bow, "but the gallantry of the compli|ment
<PB N="137" REF="029378_0069_0FE07F626070BBB8">
had been utterly lo&s;t, but for the ingenuity that di&s;covered the application."</P>
<P>Madame Cheron did not perceive the meaning of this too &s;at|irical &s;entence, and &s;he, therefore, e&s;caped the pain, which Emily felt on her account. "O! here comes &s;ignor Montoni him&s;elf," &s;aid her aunt, "I prote&s;t I will tell him all the fine things you have been &s;aying to me." The &s;ignor, however, pa&s;&s;ed at this moment into another walk. "Pray, who is it, that has &s;o much engaged your friend this evening?" a&s;ked Madame Cheron, with an air of chagrin, "I have not &s;een him once."</P>
<P>"He had a very particular engagement with the Marquis La Riviere," replied Cavigni, "which has detained him, I perceive till this moment, or he would have done him&s;elf the honour of paying his re&s;pects to you, madam, &s;ooner, as he commi&s;&s;ioned me to &s;ay. But I know not how it is&mdash;your conver&s;ation is &s;o fa&s;|cinating&mdash;that it can charm even memory, I think, or I &s;hould certainly have delivered my friend's apology before."</P>
<P>"The apology, &s;ir, would have been more &s;atisfactory from him&s;elf," &s;aid Madame Cheron, who&s;e vanity was more mortified by Montoni's neglect, than flattered by Cavigni's compliment. Her manner, at this moment, and Cavigni's late conver&s;ation, now awakened a &s;u&s;picion in Emily's mind, which, notwith|&s;tanding that &s;ome recollections &s;erved to confirm it, appeared prepo&s;terous. She thought &s;he perceived, that Montoni was pay|ing &s;erious addre&s;&s;es to her aunt, and that &s;he not only accepted them, but was jealou&s;ly watchful of any appearance of neglect on his part. That Madame Cheron at her years &s;hould elect a &s;e|cond hu&s;band was ridiculous, though her vanity made it not impo&s;&s;ible; but that Montoni, with his di&s;cernment, his figure, and preten&s;ions, &s;hould make a choice of Madame Cheron&mdash;ap|peared mo&s;t wonderful. Her thoughts, however, did not dwell long on the &s;ubject; nearer intere&s;ts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon them; Valan|court, rejected of her aunt, and Valancourt dancing with a gay and beautiful partner, alternately tormented her mind. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along the gardens &s;he looked timidly forward, half fearing and half hoping that he might appear in the crowd; and the di&s;|appointment &s;he felt on not &s;eeing him, told her, that &s;he had hoped more than &s;he had feared.</P>
<P>Montoni &s;oon after joined the party. He muttered over &s;ome &s;hort &s;peech about regret for having been &s;o long detained el&s;e|where, when he knew he &s;hould have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Ma|dame Cheron here; and &s;he, receiving the apology with the air of a petti&s;h girl, addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf entirely to Cavigni, who look|ed
<PB N="138" REF="029378_0070_0FE07F6DAF34C720">
archly at Montoni, as if he would have &s;aid, "I will not triumph over you too much; I will have the goodne&s;s to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear my honours meekly; but look &s;harp, &s;ignor, or I &s;hall certainly run away with your prize."</P>
<P>The &s;upper was &s;erved in different pavilions in the gardens, as well as in one large &s;aloon of the chateau, and with more of ta&s;te, than either of &s;plendour, or even of plenty. Madame Che|ron and her party &s;upped with Madame Clairval in the &s;aloon, and Emily, with difficulty, di&s;gui&s;ed her emotion, when &s;he &s;aw Valancourt placed at the &s;ame table with her&s;elf. There, Ma|dame Cheron having &s;urveyed him with high di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aid to &s;ome per&s;on who &s;at next to her, "Pray who <HI>is</HI> that young man?" "It is the Chevalier Valancourt," was the an&s;wer. "Yes, I am not ignorant of his name, but who is this Chevalier Valancourt that thus intrudes him&s;elf at this table?" The at|tention of the per&s;on, to whom &s;he &s;poke, was called off before &s;he received a &s;econd reply. The table, at which they &s;at, was very long, and, Valancourt being &s;eated, with his partner, near the bottom, and Emily near the top, the di&s;tance between them may account for his not immediately perceiving her. She avoided looking to that end of the table, but whenever her eyes happened to glance towards it, &s;he ob&s;erved him, conver&s;ing with his beautiful companion, and the ob&s;ervation did not con|tribute to re&s;tore her peace, any more than the accounts &s;he heard of the fortune and accompli&s;hments of this &s;ame lady.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron, to whom the&s;e remarks were &s;ometimes ad|dre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e they &s;upported topics for trivial conver&s;ation, &s;eemed indefatigable in her attempts to depreciate Valancourt, towards whom &s;he felt all the petty re&s;entment of a narrow pride. "I admire the lady," &s;aid &s;he, "but I mu&s;t condemn her choice of a partner." "Oh, the Chevalier Valancourt is one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young men we have," replied the lady, to whom this remark was addre&s;&s;ed; "it is whi&s;pered, that Ma|demoi&s;elle D'Emery and her very large fortune are to be his."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" exclaimed Madame Cheron, reddening with vexation, "it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he can be &s;o de&s;titute of ta&s;te: he has &s;o little the air of a per&s;on of condition, that, if I did not &s;ee him at the table of Madame Clairval, I &s;hould never have &s;u&s;pected him to be one. I have be&s;ides particular rea&s;ons for believing the report to be erroneous."</P>
<P>"I cannot doubt the truth of it," replied the lady gravely, di&s;gu&s;ted by the abrupt contradiction &s;he had received, concern|ing her opinion of Valancourt's merit. "You will, perhaps,
<PB N="139" REF="029378_0070_0FE07F6DAF34C720">
doubt it," &s;aid Madame Cheron, "when I a&s;&s;ure you, that it was only this morning that I rejected his &s;uit." This was &s;aid without any intention of impo&s;ing the meaning it conveyed, but &s;imply from a habit of con&s;idering her&s;elf to be the mo&s;t impor|tant per&s;on in every affair that concerned her niece, and becau&s;e literally &s;he had rejected Valancourt. "Your rea&s;ons are in|deed &s;uch as cannot be doubted," replied the lady, with an iron|ical &s;mile.&mdash;"Any more than the di&s;cernment of the Cheva|lier Valancourt," added Cavigni, who &s;tood by the chair of Ma|dame Cheron, and had heard her arrogate to her&s;elf, as he thought, a di&s;tinction, which had been paid to her niece. "His di&s;cernment <HI>may</HI> be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, &s;ignor," &s;aid Madame Cheron, who was not flattered by what &s;he under&s;tood to be an encomium upon Emily.</P>
<P>"Alas!" exclaimed Cavigni, &s;urveying Madame Cheron with affected ec&s;tacy, "how vain is that a&s;&s;ertion, while that face&mdash;that &s;hape&mdash;that air&mdash;combine to refute it! Unhappy Valancourt! his di&s;cernment has been his de&s;truction."</P>
<P>Emily looked &s;urpri&s;ed and embarra&s;&s;ed; the lady, who had lately &s;poken, a&s;toni&s;hed, and Madame Cheron, who, though &s;he did not perfectly under&s;tand this &s;peech, was very ready to be|lieve her&s;elf complimented by it, &s;aid &s;milingly, "O Signor! you are very gallant; but tho&s;e, who hear you vindicate the cheva|lier's di&s;cernment, will &s;uppo&s;e that I am the object of it."</P>
<P>"They cannot doubt it," replied Cavigni, bowing low.</P>
<P>"And would not that be very mortifying, Signor?"</P>
<P>"Unque&s;tionably it would," &s;aid Cavigni.</P>
<P>"I cannot endure the thought," &s;aid Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>"It is not to be endured," replied Cavigni.</P>
<P>"What can be done to prevent &s;o humiliating a mi&s;take?" rejoined Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>"Alas! I cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t you," replied Cavigni, with a de|liberating air. "Your only chance of refuting the calumny, and of making people under&s;tand what you wi&s;h them to be|lieve, is to per&s;i&s;t in your fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion; for, when they are told of the chevalier's want of di&s;cernment, it is po&s;&s;ible they may &s;uppo&s;e he never pre&s;umed to di&s;tre&s;s you with his admiration. But then again&mdash;that diffidence, which renders you &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to your own perfections&mdash;they will con&s;ider this, and Valan|court's ta&s;te will not be doubted, though you arraign it. In &s;hort, they will, in &s;pite of your endeavours, continue to believe, what might very naturally have occurred to them without any hint of mine&mdash;that the chevalier has ta&s;te enough to admire a beautiful woman."</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="029378_0071_0FE07F7365C85918">
"All this is very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing!" &s;aid Madame Cheron with a profound &s;igh.</P>
<P>"May I be allowed to a&s;k what is &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing?" &s;aid Ma|dame Clairval, who was &s;truck with the rueful countenance and doleful accent, with which this was delivered.</P>
<P>"It is a delicate &s;ubject," replied Madame Cheron, "a very mortifying one to me." "I am concerned to hear it," &s;aid Ma|dame Clairval, "I hope nothing has occurred, this evening, par|ticularly to di&s;tre&s;s you?" "Alas, yes! within this half hour; and I know not where the report may end;&mdash;my pride was never &s;o &s;hocked before, but I a&s;&s;ure you the report is totally void of foundation," "Good God!" exclaimed Madame Clairval, "what can be done? Can you point out any way, by which I can a&s;&s;i&s;t, or con&s;ole you?"</P>
<P>"The only way, by which you can do either," replied Ma|dame Cheron, "is to contradict the report wherever you go."</P>
<P>"Well! but pray inform me what I am to contradict."</P>
<P>"It is &s;o very humiliating, that I know not how to mention it," continued Madame Cheron, "but you &s;hall judge. Do you ob&s;erve that young man &s;eated near the bottom of the table, who is conver&s;ing with Mademoi&s;elle D'Emery?" "Yes, I per|ceive whom you mean," "You ob&s;erve how little he has the air of a per&s;on of condition; I was &s;aying ju&s;t now, that I &s;hould not have thought him a gentleman, if I had not &s;een him at this table." "Well! but the report," &s;aid Madame Clairval, "let me under&s;tand the &s;ubject of your di&s;tre&s;s." "Ah! the &s;ubject of my di&s;tre&s;s," replied Madame Cheron: "this per&s;on whom nobody knows&mdash;(I beg pardon, madam, I did not con&s;ider what I &s;aid) this impertinent young man, having had the pre&s;umption to addre&s;s my niece, has, I fear, given ri&s;e to a report, that he had declared him&s;elf my admirer. Now only con&s;ider how very mortifying &s;uch a report mu&s;t be! You, I know, will feel for my &s;ituation. A woman of my condition! think how degrad|ing even the rumour of &s;uch an alliance mu&s;t be."</P>
<P>"Degrading indeed, my poor friend!" &s;aid Madame Clairval. "You may rely upon it I will contradict the report wherever I go;" as &s;he &s;aid which, &s;he turned her attention upon another part of the company; and Cavigni, who had hitherto appeared a grave &s;pectator of the &s;cene, now fearing he &s;hould be unable to &s;mother the laugh, that convul&s;ed him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alked abruptly away.</P>
<P>"I perceive you do not know," &s;aid the lady who &s;at near Madame Cheron, "that the gentleman you have been &s;peaking of is Madame Clairval's nephew!" "Impo&s;&s;ible!" exclaimed Ma|dame
<PB N="141" REF="029378_0071_0FE07F7365C85918">
Cheron, who now began to perceive that &s;he had been to|tally mi&s;taken in her judgment of Valancourt, and to prai&s;e him aloud with as much &s;ervility, as &s;he had before cen&s;ured him with frivolous malignity.</P>
<P>Emily, who, during the greater part of this conver&s;ation, had been &s;o ab&s;orbed in thought as to be &s;pared the pain of hearing it, was now extremely &s;urpri&s;ed by her aunt's prai&s;e of Valan|court, with who&s;e relation&s;hip to Madame Clairval &s;he was unac|quainted; but &s;he was not &s;orry when Madame Cheron, who though &s;he now tried to appear unconcerned, was really much embarra&s;&s;ed, prepared to withdraw immediately after &s;upper. Montoni then came to hand Madame Cheron to her carriage, and Cavigni, with an arch &s;olemnity of countenance, followed with Emily, who, as &s;he wi&s;hed them good night, and drew up the gla&s;s, &s;aw Valancourt among the crowd at the gates. Before the carriage drove off, he di&s;appeared. Madame Cheron for|bore to mention him to Emily, and, as &s;oon as they reached the chateau, they &s;eparated for the night.</P>
<P>On the following morning, as Emily &s;at at breakfa&s;t with her aunt, a letter was brought to her, of which &s;he knew the hand|writing upon the cover; and, as &s;he received it with a trembling hand, Madame Cheron ha&s;tily inquired from whom it came. Emily, with her leave broke the &s;eal, and, ob&s;erving the &s;igna|ture of Valancourt, gave it unread to her aunt, who received it with impatience; and, as &s;he looked it over, Emily endeavour|ed to read on her countenance its contents. Having returned the letter to her niece, who&s;e eyes a&s;ked if &s;he might examine it, "Yes, read it, child," &s;aid Madame Cheron, in a manner le&s;s &s;evere than &s;he had expected, and Emily had, perhaps, never be|fore &s;o willingly obeyed her aunt. In this letter Valancourt &s;aid little of the interview of the preceding day, but concluded with declaring, that he would accept his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from Emily only, and with intreating, that &s;he would allow him to wait upon her, on the approaching evening. When &s;he read this, &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at the moderation of Madame Cheron, and looked at her with timid expectation, as &s;he &s;aid &s;orrowfully&mdash;"What am I to &s;ay, madam?"</P>
<P>"Why&mdash;we mu&s;t &s;ee the young man, I believe," replied her aunt, "and hear what he has further to &s;ay for him&s;elf. You may tell him he may come." Emily dared &s;carcely credit what &s;he heard. "Yet, &s;tay," added Madame Cheron, "I will tell him &s;o my&s;elf." She called for pen and ink; Emily &s;till not dar|ing to tru&s;t the emotions &s;he felt, and almo&s;t &s;inking beneath
<PB N="142" REF="029378_0072_0FE07F81C99BF600">
them. Her &s;urpri&s;e would have been le&s;s had &s;he overheard, on the preceding evening, what Madame Cheron had not forgot|ten&mdash;that Valancourt was the nephew of Madame Clairval.</P>
<P>What were the particulars of her aunt's note, Emily did not learn, but the re&s;ult was a vi&s;it from Valancourt in the evening, whom Madame Cheron received alone, and they had a long con|ver&s;ation before Emily was called down. When &s;he entered the room, her aunt was conver&s;ing with complacency, and &s;he &s;aw the eyes of Valancourt, as he impatiently ro&s;e, animated with hope.</P>
<P>"We have been talking over this affair," &s;aid Madame Cheron, "the chevalier has been telling me, that the late Mon|&s;ieur Clairval was the brother of the Counte&s;s de Duvarney, his mother. I only wi&s;h he had mentioned his relation&s;hip to Madame Clairval before, I certainly &s;hould have con&s;idered that circum&s;tance as a &s;ufficient introduction to my hou&s;e." Valan|court bowed, and was going to addre&s;s Emily, but her aunt prevented him. "I have therefore, con&s;ented, that you &s;hall receive his vi&s;its; and, though I will not bind my&s;elf by any promi&s;e, or &s;ay, that I &s;hall con&s;ider him as my nephew, yet, I &s;hall permit the intercour&s;e, and &s;hall look forward to any fur|ther connection as an event, which may po&s;&s;ibly take place in a cour&s;e of years, provided the chevalier ri&s;es in his profe&s;&s;ion or any circum&s;tance occurs, which may make it prudent for him to take a wife. But Mon&s;. Valancourt will ob&s;erve, and you too, Emily, that, till that happens, I po&s;itively forbid any thoughts of marrying."</P>
<P>Emily's countenance, during this coar&s;e &s;peech, varied every in&s;tant, and, towards its conclu&s;ion, her di&s;tre&s;s had &s;o much in|crea&s;ed, that &s;he was on the point of leaving the room. Valan|court, meanwhile, &s;carcely le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed, did not dare to look at her for whom he was thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; but, when Madame Cheron was &s;ilent, he &s;aid, "Flattering, madam, as your ap|probation is to me&mdash;highly as I am honoured by it&mdash;I have yet &s;o much to fear, that I &s;carcely dare to hope." "Pray, &s;ir, ex|plain your&s;elf," &s;aid Madame Cheron; an unexpected requi&s;i|tion, which embarra&s;&s;ed Valancourt again, and almo&s;t overcame him with confu&s;ion, at circum&s;tances, on which, had he been on|ly a &s;pectator of the &s;cene, he would have &s;miled.</P>
<P>"Till I receive Mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert's permi&s;&s;ion to ac|cept your indulgence," &s;aid he, falteringly&mdash;"till &s;he allows me to hope&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O! is that all?" interrupted Madame Cheron. "Well, I will take upon me to an&s;wer for her. But at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="143" REF="029378_0072_0FE07F81C99BF600">
&s;ir, give me leave to ob&s;erve to you, that I am her guardian, and that I expect, in every in&s;tance, that my will is hers."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, &s;he ro&s;e and quitted the room, leaving Emily and Valancourt in a &s;tate of mutual embarra&s;&s;ment; and, when Valancourt's hopes enabled him to overcome his fears, and to ad|dre&s;s her with the zeal and &s;incerity &s;o natural to him, it was a con&s;iderable time before &s;he was &s;ufficiently recovered to hear with di&s;tinctne&s;s his &s;olicitations and inquiries.</P>
<P>The conduct of Madame Cheron in this affair had been in|tirely governed by &s;elfi&s;h vanity. Valancourt in his fir&s;t inter|view, had with great candour laid open to her the true &s;tate of his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and his future expectancies, and &s;he, with more prudence than humanity, had ab&s;olutely and abruptly rejected his &s;uit. She wi&s;hed her niece to marry ambitiou&s;ly, not becau&s;e &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the happine&s;s, which rank and wealth are u&s;ually believed to be&s;tow, but be|cau&s;e &s;he de&s;ired to partake the importance, which &s;uch an alli|ance would give. When, therefore, &s;he di&s;covered that Valan|court was the nephew of a per&s;on of &s;o much con&s;equence as Madame Clairval, &s;he became anxious for the connection, &s;ince the pro&s;pect it afforded of future fortune and di&s;tinction for Em|ily, promi&s;ed the exaltation &s;he coveted for her&s;elf. Her calcu|lations concerning fortune in this alliance were guided rather by her wi&s;hes, than by any hint of Valancourt, or &s;trong appearance of probability; and when, &s;he re&s;ted her expectation on the wealth of Madame Clairval, &s;he &s;eeemd totally to have forgotten, that the latter had a daughter. Valancourt, however, had not forgotten this circum&s;tance, and the con&s;ideration of it had made him &s;o mode&s;t in his expectations from Madame Clairval, that he had not even named the relation&s;hip in his fir&s;t conver&s;a|tion with Madame Cheron. But whatever might be the future for|tune of Emily, the pre&s;ent di&s;tinction, which the connection would afford for her&s;elf, was certain, &s;ince the &s;plendour of Madame Clairval's e&s;tabli&s;hment was &s;uch as to excite the general envy and partial imitation of the neighbourhood. Thus had &s;he con|&s;ented to involve her niece in an engagement, to which &s;he &s;aw only a di&s;tant and uncertain conclu&s;ion, with as little con&s;idera|tion of her happine&s;s, as when &s;he had &s;o precipitately forbade it: for though &s;he her&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the means of rendering this union not only certain, but prudent, yet to do &s;o was no part of her pre&s;ent intention.</P>
<P>From this period Valancourt made frequent vi&s;its to Madame Cheron, and Emily pa&s;&s;ed in his &s;ociety the happie&s;t hours &s;he
<PB N="144" REF="029378_0073_0FE07F866095A108">
had known &s;ince the death of her father. They were both too much engaged by the pre&s;ent moments to give &s;erious con&s;idera|tion to the future. They loved, and were beloved, and &s;aw not, that the very attachment, which formed the delight of their pre|&s;ent days, might po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion the &s;ufferings of years. Mean|while, Madame Cheron's intercour&s;e with Madame Clairval be|came more frequent than before, and her vanity was already grat|ified by the opportunity of proclaiming, wherever &s;he went, the attachment that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between their nephew and niece.</P>
<P>Montoni was now al&s;o become a daily gue&s;t at the chateau, and Emily was compelled to ob&s;erve, that he really was a &s;uitor, and a favoured &s;uitor, to her aunt.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the winter months, not only in peace, but in hap|pine&s;s, to Valancourt and Emily; the &s;tation of his regiment be|ing &s;o near Tholou&s;e, as to allow this frequent intercour&s;e. The pavilion on the terrace was the favourite &s;cene of their inter|views, and there Emily, with Madame Cheron, would work, while Valancourt read aloud works of genius and ta&s;te, li&s;tened to her enthu&s;ia&s;m, expre&s;&s;ed his own, and caught new opportuni|ties of ob&s;erving, that their minds were formed to con&s;titute the happine&s;s of each other, the &s;ame ta&s;te, the &s;ame noble and bene|volent &s;entiments animating each.</P>

<P>MADAME Cheron's avarice at length yielded to her vanity. Some very &s;plendid entertainments, which Madame Clairval had given, and the general adulation, which was paid her, made the former more anxious than before to &s;ecure an alliance; that would &s;o much exalt her in her own opinion and in that of the world. She propo&s;ed terms for the immediate marriage of her
<PB N="145" REF="029378_0073_0FE07F866095A108">
niece, and offered to give Emily a dower, provided Madame Clairval ob&s;erved equal terms on the part of her nephew. Madame Clairval li&s;tened to the propo&s;al, and, con&s;idering that Emily was the apparent heire&s;s of her aunt's wealth, accepted it. Mean|while, Emily knew nothing of the tran&s;action, till Madame Che|ron informed her, that &s;he mu&s;t make preparation for the nup|tials, which would be celebrated without further delay; then, a&s;toni&s;hed and wholly unable to account for this &s;udden conclu|&s;ion, which Valancourt had not &s;olicited (for he was ignorant of what had pa&s;&s;ed between the elder ladies, and had not dared to hope &s;uch good fortune) &s;he deci&s;ively objected to it. Madame Cheron, however, quite as jealous of contradiction now, as &s;he had been formerly, contended for a &s;peedy marriage with as much vehemence as &s;he had formerly oppo&s;ed whatever had the mo&s;t remote po&s;&s;ibility of leading to it; and Emily's &s;cruples di&s;ap|peared, when &s;he again &s;aw Valancourt, who was now informed of the happine&s;s, de&s;igned for him, and came to claim a promi&s;e of it from her&s;elf.</P>
<P>While preparations were making for the&s;e nuptials, Montoni became the acknowledged lover of Madame Cheron; and, though Madame Clairval was much di&s;plea&s;ed, when &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the approaching connection, and was willing to prevent that of Valancourt with Emily, her con&s;cience told her, that &s;he had no right thus to trifle with their peace, and Madame Clairval, though a woman of fa&s;hion, was far le&s;s advanced than her friend in the art of deriving &s;atisfaction from di&s;tinction and admiration, rather than from con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Emily ob&s;erved with concern the a&s;cendancy, which Monto|ni had acquired over Madame Cheron, as well as the increa&s;ing frequency of his vi&s;its; and her own opinion of this Italian was confirmed by that of Valancourt, who had always expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;like of him. As &s;he was, one morning, &s;itting at work in the pavilion, enjoying the plea&s;ant fre&s;hne&s;s of &s;pring, who&s;e col|ours were now &s;pread upon the land&s;cape, and li&s;tening to Val|ancourt, who was reading, but who often laid a&s;ide the book to conver&s;e, &s;he received a &s;ummons to attend Madame Cheron immediately, and had &s;carcely entered the dre&s;&s;ing-room, when &s;he ob&s;erved, with &s;urpri&s;e, the dejection of her aunt's counte|nance, and the contra&s;ted gaiety of her dre&s;s. "So, niece!"&mdash;&s;aid Madame, and &s;he &s;topped under &s;ome degree of embarra&s;&s;|ment.&mdash;"I &s;ent for you,&mdash;I&mdash;I wi&s;hed to &s;ee you; I have news to tell you. From this hour you mu&s;t con&s;ider the &s;ignor Mon|toni as your uncle&mdash;we were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this morning."</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="029378_0074_0FE07F94182AF360">
A&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;not &s;o much at the marriage, as at the &s;ecrecy with which it had been concluded, and the agitation with which it was announced, Emily, at length, attributed the privacy to the wi&s;h of Montoni, rather than of her aunt. His wife, how|ever, intended, that the contrary &s;hould be believed, and there|fore added, "You &s;ee I wi&s;hed to avoid a bu&s;tle; but now the ceremony is over I &s;hall do &s;o no longer; and I wi&s;h to an|nounce to my &s;ervants, that they mu&s;t receive the &s;ignor Monto|ni for their ma&s;ter." Emily made a feeble attempt to congratu|late her on the&s;e apparently imprudent nuptials. "I &s;hall now celebrate my marriage with &s;ome &s;plendour," continued Madame Montoni, "and to &s;ave time I &s;hall avail my&s;elf of the prepara|tion that has been made for yours, which will, of cour&s;e, be de|layed a little while. Such of your wedding clothes as are ready I &s;hall expect you will appear in, to do honour to this fe&s;tival. I al&s;o wi&s;h you to inform Mon&s;ieur Valancourt, that I have changed my name, and he will acquaint Madame Clairv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l. In a few days I &s;hall give a grand entertainment, at which I &s;hall reque&s;t their pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;o lo&s;t in &s;urpri&s;e and various thought, that &s;he made Madame Montoni &s;carcely any reply, but, at her de&s;ire, &s;he returned to inform Valancourt of what had pa&s;&s;ed. Surpri&s;e was not his predominant emotion on hearing of the&s;e ha&s;ty nup|tials; and, when he learned, that they were to be the means of delaying his own, and that the very ornaments of the chateau, which had been prepared to grace the nuptial day of his Emily, were to be degraded to the celebration of Madame Montoni's, grief and indignation agitated him alternately. He could con|ceal neither from the ob&s;ervation of Emily, who&s;e efforts to ab|&s;tract him from the&s;e &s;erious emotions, and to laugh at the ap|prehen&s;ive con&s;iderations, that a&s;&s;ailed him, were ineffectual; and, when, at length, he took leave, there was an earne&s;t tender|ne&s;s in his manner, that extremely affected her&punc; &s;he even &s;hed tears, when he di&s;appeared at the end of the terrace, yet knew not exactly why &s;he &s;hould do &s;o.</P>
<P>Montoni now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the chateau and the command of its inhabitants, with the ea&s;e of a man, who had long con&s;id|ered it to be his own. His friend Cavigni, who had been ex|tremely &s;erviceable, in having paid Madame Cheron the atten|tion and flattery, which &s;he required, but from which Montoni too often revolted, had apartments a&s;&s;igned him, and received from the dome&s;tics an equal degree of obedience with the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="029378_0074_0FE07F94182AF360">
Within a few days, Madame Montoni, as &s;he had promi&s;ed, gave a magnificent entertainment to a very numerous company, among whom was Valancourt; but at which Madame Clairval excu&s;ed her&s;elf from attending. There was a concert, ball and &s;upper. Valancourt was, of cour&s;e, Emily's partner, and though, when he gave a look to the decorations of the apartments, he could not but remember, that they were de&s;igned for other fe&s;|tivities, than tho&s;e they now contributed to celebrate, he endea|voured to check his concern by con&s;idering, that a little while only would elap&s;e before they would be given to their original de&s;tination. During this evening, Madame Montoni danced, laughed and talked ince&s;&s;antly; while Montoni, &s;ilent, re&s;erved and &s;omewhat haughty, &s;eemed weary of the parade, and of the frivolous company it had drawn together.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t and the la&s;t entertainment, given in celebra|tion of their nuptials. Montoni, though the &s;everity of his tem|per and the gloomine&s;s of his pride prevented him from enjoying &s;uch fe&s;tivities, was extremely willing to promote them. It was &s;eldom, that he could meet in any company a man of more ad|dre&s;s, and &s;till &s;eldomer one of more under&s;tanding, that him|&s;elf&punc; the balance of advantage in &s;uch parties, or in the connec|tions, which might ari&s;e from them, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t, therefore, be on his &s;ide; and, knowing, as he did, the &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, for which they are generally frequented, he had no objection to mea&s;ure his talents of di&s;&s;imulation with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of any other competitor for di&s;tinction and plunder. But his wife, who, when her own intere&s;t was immediately concerned, had &s;ometimes more di&s;|cernment than vanity, acquired a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her inferiority to other women, in per&s;onal attractions, which, uniting with the jealou&s;y natural to the di&s;covery, counteracted his readine&s;s for mingling with all the parties Tholou&s;e could afford. Till &s;he had, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, the affections of an hu&s;band to lo&s;e, &s;he had no motive for di&s;covering the unwelcome truth, and it had nev|er obtruded it&s;elf upon her; but, now that it influenced her policy, &s;he oppo&s;ed her hu&s;band's inclination for company, with the more eagerne&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he believed him to be really as well received in the female &s;ociety of the place, as, during his ad|dre&s;&s;es to her, he had affected to be.</P>
<P>A few weeks only had elap&s;ed, &s;ince the marriage, when Mad|ame Montoni informed Emily, that the &s;ignor intented to return to Italy, as &s;oon as the nece&s;&s;ary preparation could be made for &s;o long a journey. "We &s;hall go to Venice," &s;aid &s;he, "where the &s;ignor has a fine man&s;ion, and from thence to his e&s;tate in
<PB N="148" REF="029378_0075_0FE07F98AD8726C0">
Tu&s;cany. Why do you look &s;o grave, child?&mdash;You are &s;o fond of a romantic country and fine views, will doubtle&s;s be de|lighted with this journey." "Am I then to be of the party, madam?" &s;aid Emily, with extreme &s;urpri&s;e and emotion.&mdash;"Mo&s;t certainly," replied her aunt, "how could you imagine we &s;hould leave you behind? But I &s;ee you are thinking of the Chevalier; he is not yet, I believe informed of the journey, but he very &s;oon will be &s;o. Signor Montoni is gone to acquaint Madame Clairval of our journey, and to &s;ay, that the propo&s;ed connection between the families mu&s;t from this time be thought of no more."</P>
<P>The unfeeling manner, in which Madame Montoni thus in|formed her niece, that &s;he mu&s;t be &s;eparated, perhaps for ever, from the man, with whom &s;he was on the point of being united for life, added to the di&s;may, which &s;he mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have &s;uf|fered at &s;uch intelligence. When &s;he could &s;peak &s;he a&s;ked the cau&s;e of the &s;udden change in Madame's &s;entiments towards Valancourt, but the only reply &s;he could obtain was, that the Signor had forbade the connection, con&s;idering it to be greatly inferior to what Emily might rea&s;onably expect.</P>
<P>"I now leave the affair intirely to the Signor," added Madame Montoni, "but I mu&s;t &s;ay, that M. Valancourt never was a fa|vourite with me, and I was overper&s;uaded, or I &s;hould not have given my con&s;ent to the connection. I was weak enough&mdash;I am &s;o fooli&s;h &s;ometimes!&mdash;to &s;uffer other people's unea&s;ine&s;s to affect me, and &s;o my better judgment yielded to your affliction. But the Signor has very properly pointed out the folly of this, and he &s;hall not have to reprove me a &s;econd time. I am de|termined, that you &s;hall &s;ubmit to tho&s;e, who know how to guide you better than your&s;elf&mdash;I am determined that you &s;hall be conformable."</P>
<P>Emily would have been a&s;toni&s;hed at the a&s;&s;ertions of this el|oquent &s;peech, had not her mind been &s;o overwhelmed by the &s;udden &s;hock it had received, that &s;he &s;carcely heard a word of what was latterly addre&s;&s;ed to her. Whatever were the weak|ne&s;&s;es of Madame Montoni, &s;he might have avoided to accu&s;e her&s;elf with tho&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion and tenderne&s;s to the feelings of others, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of Emily. It was the &s;ame ambi|tion, that lately prevailed upon her to &s;olicit an alliance with Madame Clairval's family, which induced her to withdraw from it, now that her marriage with Montoni had exalted her &s;elf-con|&s;equence, and with it, her views for her niece.</P>
<P>Emily was, at this time, too much affected to employ either remon&s;trance, or entreaty on this topic; and when, at length,
<PB N="149" REF="029378_0075_0FE07F98AD8726C0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> attempted the latter, her emotion overcame her &s;peech, and &s;he retired to her apartment, to think, if in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her mind to think was po&s;&s;ible, upon this &s;udden and overwhelm|ing &s;ubject. It was very long before her &s;pirits were &s;uf|ficiently compo&s;ed to permit the reflection, which, when it came, was dark and even terrible. She &s;aw that Montoni &s;ought to aggrandize him&s;elf in his di&s;po&s;al of her, and it occured, that his friend Cavigni was the per&s;on, for whom he was intere&s;ted.&mdash;The pro&s;pect of going to Italy was &s;till rendered darker, when &s;he con&s;idered the tumultuous &s;ituation of that country, then torn by civil commotion, where every petty &s;tate was at war with its neighbour, and even every ca&s;tle liable to the attack of an inva|der. She con&s;idered the per&s;on, to who&s;e immediate guidance &s;he would be committed, and the va&s;t di&s;tance that was to &s;ep|arate her from Valancourt, and, at the recollection of him, every other image vani&s;hed from her mind, and every thought was again ob&s;cured by grief.</P>
<P>In this perturbed &s;tate &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours, and, when &s;he was &s;ummoned to dinner, &s;he entreated permi&s;&s;ion to remain in her own apartment; but Madame Montoni was alone, and the reque&s;t was refu&s;ed. Emily and her aunt &s;aid little during the repa&s;t; the one occupied by her griefs, the other engro&s;&s;ed by the di&s;appointment, which the unexpected ab&s;ence of Montoni occa&s;ioned; for not only was her vanity piqued by the neglect, but her jealou&s;y alarmed by what &s;he con&s;idered as a my&s;terious engagement. When the cloth was drawn and they were alone, Emily renewed the mention of Valancourt; but her aunt, nei|ther &s;oftened to pity, or awakened to remor&s;e, became enraged, that her will &s;hould be oppo&s;ed, and the authority of Montoni que&s;tioned, though this was done by Emily with her u&s;ual gentle|ne&s;s, who, after a long, and torturing conver&s;ation, retired in tears.</P>
<P>As &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the hall, a per&s;on entered it by the great door, whom, as her eyes ha&s;tily glanced that way, &s;he imagined to be Montoni, and &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing on with quicker &s;teps, when &s;he heard the well known voice of Valancourt.</P>
<P>"Emily, O! my Emily!" cried he in a tone faltering with impatience, while &s;he turned, and, as he advanced, was alarmed at the expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance and the eager de&s;peration of his air.

<P>He ob&s;erved the open door of an apartment, and ha&s;tily took her hand to lead her thither; but &s;he attempted to withdraw it,

and &s;aid, with a languid &s;mile. "I am better already; If you wi&s;h to &s;ee my aunt &s;he is in the dining-parlour." "I mu&s;t &s;peak with <HI>you,</HI> my Emily," replied Valancourt, "Good God! is it already come to this? Are you indeed &s;o willing to re&s;ign me?

<P>The de&s;pondency, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ke this, affected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> al|mo&s;t to tears, but &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to hear him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> conver&s;ed with Madame Montoni. "Where is her hu&s;band, where, then, is Montoni?" &s;aid Valancourt, in an altered tone, "it is he, to whom I mu&s;t &s;peak."</P>
<P>Emily, terrified for the con&s;equence of the indignation, that fla&s;hed in his eyes, tremblingly a&s;&s;ured him that Montoni was not at home, and intreated he would endeavour to moderate his re|&s;entment. At the tremulous accents of her voice, his eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;tantly from wildne&s;s into tenderne&s;s. "You are ill, Em|ily." &s;aid he, "they will de&s;troy us both! Forgive me, that I dared to doubt your affection."</P>
<P>Emily no longer oppo&s;ed him, as he led her into an adjoining parlour; the manner, in which he had named Montoni, had &s;o much alarmed her for his own &s;afety, that &s;he was now only anx|ious to prevent the con&s;equences of his ju&s;t re&s;entment. He li&s;t|ened to her entreaties, with attention, but replied to them only with looks of de&s;pondency and tenderne&s;s, concealing, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;entiments he felt toward Montoni, that he might &s;ooth the apprehen&s;ions, which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her. But &s;he &s;aw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> veil he had &s;pread over his re&s;entment, and, his a&s;&s;umed tranquil|lity only alarming her more, &s;he urged, at length, the impoli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of forcing an interview with Montoni, and of taking any mea|&s;ure, which might render their &s;eparation irremediable. Valan|court yielded to the&s;e remon&s;trances, and her affecting entreaties drew from him a promi&s;e, that, however Montoni might per&s;i&s;t in his de&s;ign of di&s;uniting them, he would not &s;eek to redre&s;s his wrongs by violence. "For my &s;ake," &s;aid Emily, "let the con|&s;ideration of what I &s;hould &s;uffer deter you from &s;uch a mode of revenge!" "For your &s;ake, Emily," replied Valancourt, his eyes, filling with tears of tenderne&s;s and grief, while he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon her. "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I &s;hall &s;ubdue my&s;elf.

<P>Emily endeavoured to &s;ooth him, with a&s;&s;urances of her unal|terable affection, and by repre&s;enting, that, in little more than a year, &s;he &s;hould be her own mi&s;tre&s;s, as far as related to her aunt, from who&s;e guardian&s;hip her age would then relea&s;e her; a&s;&s;ur|an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; which gave little con&s;olation to Valancourt, who con&s;ider|ed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would then be in Italy and in the power of tho&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ho&s;e dominion over her would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> cea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e with their rights; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> affected to be con&s;oled by them.

She threw a glance of &s;harp reproof upon her niece, who immediately with|drew, and of haughty di&s;plea&s;ure upon Valancourt</P>
<P>"This is not the conduct I &s;hould have expected from you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir;" &s;aid &s;he, "I did not expect to &s;ee you in my hou&s;e, after you had been informed, that your vi&s;its were no longer agreeable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uch le&s;s, that you would &s;eek a clande&s;tine interview with my niece, and that &s;he would grant one."</P>
<P>Valancourt, perceiving it nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate Emily from &s;uch a de&s;ign, explained, that the purpo&s;e of his own vi&s;it had been to reque&s;t an interview with Montoni, and he then entered upon the &s;ubject of it, with the tempered &s;pirit, which the &s;ex, rather than the re&s;pectability, of Madame Montoni, demanded.</P>
<P>His expo&s;tulations were an&s;wered with &s;evere rebuke; &s;he lamented again, that her prudence had ever yielded to what &s;he termed compa&s;&s;ion, and added, that &s;he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the folly of her former con&s;ent, that, to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of a repetition &s;he had committed the affair intirely to the conduct of Signor Montoni.</P>
<P>The feeling eloquence of Valancourt, however, at length, made her &s;en&s;ible in &s;ome mea&s;ure of her unworthy conduct, and &s;he became &s;u&s;ceptible to &s;hame, but not to remor&s;e: &s;he hated Valancourt, who awakened her to this painful &s;en&s;ation, and, in proportion as &s;he grew di&s;&s;atisfied with her&s;elf, her abhorrance of him increa&s;ed. This was al&s;o the more inveterate, becau&s;e his tempered words and manner were &s;uch as, without accu&s;ing her, compelled her to accu&s;e her&s;elf, and neither left her a hope, that the odious portrait was the caricature of his prejudice, or afforded her an excu&s;e for expre&s;&s;ing the violent re&s;entment, with which &s;he contemplated it. At length, her anger ro&s;e to &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> height, that Valancourt was compelled to leave the hou&s;e
<PB N="152" REF="029378_0077_0FE07FABB7C25290">
abruptly left he &s;hould forfeit his own e&s;teem by an intemperate reply. He was then convinced, that from Madame Montoni, he had nothing to hope, for what of either pity, or ju&s;tice could be expected from a per&s;on, who could feel the pain of guilt, without the humility of repentance.</P>
<P>To Montoni he looked with equal de&s;pondency, &s;ince it was nearly evident, that this plan of &s;eparation originated with him, and it was not probable, that he would relinqui&s;h his own view<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to entreaties, or remon&s;trances, which he mu&s;t have fore&s;een and have been prepared to re&s;i&s;t. Yet, remembering his promi&s;e to Emily, and more &s;olicitous, concerning his love, than jealous of his con&s;equence, Valancourt was careful to do nothing that might unnece&s;&s;arily irritate Montoni; he wrote to him, there|fore, not to demand an interview, but to &s;olicit one, and, hav|ing done this, he endeavoured to await with calmne&s;s his reply.</P>
<P>Madame Clairval was pa&s;&s;ive in the affair. When &s;he gave her approbation to Valancourt's marriage, it was in the be|lief, that Emily would be the heire&s;s of Madame Montoni's for|tune; and, though, upon the nuptials of the latter, when &s;he perceived the fallacy of this expectation, her con&s;cience had withheld her from adopting any mea&s;ure to prevent the union, her benevolence was not &s;ufficiently active to impel her towards any &s;tep, that might now promote it. She was on the contrary, &s;ecretly plea&s;ed, that Valancourt was relea&s;ed from an engage|ment, which &s;he con&s;idered to be as inferior, in point of fortune, to his merit, as his alliance was thought by Montoni to be hu|miliating to the beauty of Emily; and, though her pride was wounded by this rejection of a member of her family, &s;he di&s;|dained to &s;hew re&s;entment otherwi&s;e, than by &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Montoni, in his reply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Valancourt, &s;aid, that as an inter|view could neither remove the objections of the one, or over|come the wi&s;hes of the other, it would &s;erve only to produce u&s;ele&s;s altercation between them. He, therefore, thought proper to refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>In con&s;ideration of the policy, &s;ugge&s;ted by Emily, and of his promi&s;e to her, Valancourt re&s;trained the impul&s;e, that urged him to the hou&s;e of Montoni, to demand what had been den <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to his entreaties. He only repeated his &s;olicitations to &s;ee him; &s;econding them from all the arguments his &s;ituation could &s;ug|ge&s;t. Thus &s;everal days pa&s;&s;ed, in remon&s;trance, on one &s;ide, and inflexible denial, on the other; for, whether it was fear, or &s;hame, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which re&s;ults from both, that made Mon|toni &s;hun the man he had injured, he was peremptory in his re|fu&s;al,
<PB N="153" REF="029378_0077_0FE07FABB7C25290">
and was neither &s;oftened to pity by the agony, which Va|lancourt's letters portrayed, or awakened to a repentance of his own inju&s;tice by the &s;trong remon&s;trances he employed. At length, Valancourt's letters were returned unopened, and then, in the fir&s;t moments of pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;pair, he forgot every pro|mi&s;e to Emily, except the &s;olemn one, which bound him to avoid violence, and ha&s;tened to Montoni's chateau, determined to &s;ee him by whatever other means might be nece&s;&s;ary. Mon|toni was denied, and Valancourt, when he afterwards inquired for Madame and Ma'am&s;elle St. Aubert, was ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed admittance by the &s;ervants. Not choo&s;ing to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to a conte&s;t with the&s;e, he, at length, departed, and, returning home in a &s;tate of mind approaching to frenzy, wrote to Emily of what had pa&s;&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ed without re&s;traint all the agony of his heart, and entreated, that, &s;ince he mu&s;t not otherwi&s;e hope to &s;ee her immediately, &s;he would allow him an interview un|known to Montoni. Soon after he had di&s;patched this, his pa&s;|&s;ions becoming more temperate, he was &s;en&s;ible of the error he had committed in having given Emily new &s;ubject of di&s;tre&s;s in the &s;trong mention of his own &s;uffering, and would have given half the world, had it been his, to recover the letter. Emily, however, was &s;pared the pain &s;he mu&s;t have received from it by the &s;u&s;picious policy of Madame Montoni, who had ordered, that all letters, addre&s;&s;ed to her niece, &s;hould be delivered to her&s;elf, and who, after having pur&s;ued this and indulged the expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment, which Valancourt's mention of Mon|toni provoked, had con&s;igned it to the flames.</P>
<P>Montoni, meanwhile every day more impatient to leave France, gave repeated orders for di&s;patch to the &s;ervants employ|ed in preparations for the journey, and to the per&s;ons, with whom he was tran&s;acting &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s. He pre&s;erved a &s;teady &s;ilence to the letters in which Valancourt, de&s;pairing of greater good, and having &s;ubdued the pa&s;&s;ion, that had tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t his policy, &s;olicited only the indulgence of being allowed to bid Emily farewell. But, when the latter learned, that &s;he was really to &s;et out in a very few days, and that it was de&s;igned he &s;hould &s;ee her no more, forgetting every con&s;ider|ation of prudence, he dared, in a &s;econd letter to Emily, to pro|po&s;e a clande&s;tine marriage. This al&s;o was tran&s;mitted to Ma|dame Montoni, and the la&s;t day of Emily's &s;tay at Tholou&s;e, ar|rived, without affording Valancourt even a line to &s;ooth his &s;uf|ferings, or a hope, that he &s;hould be allowed a parting inter|view.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="029378_0078_0FE07FB82DEFEEF8">
During this period of torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e to Valancourt, Emily was &s;unk into that kind of &s;tupor, with which &s;udden and irre|mediable misfortune &s;ometimes overwhelms the mind. Loving him with the tendere&s;t affection, and having long been accu&s;tom|ed to con&s;ider him as the friend and companion of all her future days, &s;he had no ideas of happine&s;s, that were not connected with him. What, then, mu&s;t have been her &s;uffering, when thus &s;ud|denly they were to be &s;eparated, perhaps, for ever, certainly to be thrown into di&s;tant parts of the world, where they could &s;care|ly hear of each other's exi&s;tence; and all this in obedience to the will of a &s;tranger, for &s;uch was Montoni, and of a per&s;on who had but lately been anxious to ha&s;ten their nuptials! It was in vain, that &s;he endeavoured to &s;ubdue her grief, and re&s;ign her&s;elf to an event, which &s;he could not avoid. The &s;ilence of Valan|court afflicted more than it &s;urpri&s;ed her, &s;ince &s;he attributed it to its ju&s;t occa&s;ion; but, when the day, preceding that, on which &s;he was to quit Tholou&s;e, arrived, and &s;he heard no mention of his being permitted to take leave of her, grief overcame every con&s;ideration, that had made her reluctant to &s;peak of him, and &s;he inquired of Madame Montoni, whether this con&s;olation had been refu&s;ed. Her aunt informed her that it had, adding, that&punc; after the provocation &s;he had her&s;elf received from Valancourt, in the la&s;t interview, and the per&s;ecution, which the Signor had &s;uffered from his letters, no entreaties &s;hould avail to procure it.</P>
<P>"If the Chevalier expected this favour from us," &s;aid &s;he, "he &s;hould have conducted him&s;elf in a very different manner; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould have waited patiently, till he knew whether we were di&s;|po&s;ed to grant it, and not have come and reproved me, becau&s;e I did not think proper to be&s;tow my niece upon him,&mdash;and then have per&s;i&s;ted in troubling the Signor, becau&s;e he did not think proper to enter into any di&s;pute about &s;o childi&s;h an affair. His be|haviour throughout has been extremely pre&s;umptuous and imperti|nent, and I de&s;ire, that I may never hear his name repeated, and that you will get the better of tho&s;e fooli&s;h &s;orrows and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and look like other people, and not appear with that di&s;mal countenance, as if you were ready to cry.

<P>Emily, having turned away to hide her tears, quitted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to indulge them, and the day was pa&s;&s;ed in an inten&s;ity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch as &s;he had, perhaps, never known before. When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> withdrew to her chamber for the night, &s;he remained in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="155" REF="029378_0078_0FE07FB82DEFEEF8">
where &s;he had placed her&s;elf, on entering the room, ab&s;orbed in her grief, till long after every member of the family, except her|&s;elf, was retired to re&s;t. She could not, dive&s;t her&s;elf of a belief, that &s;he had parted with Valancourt to meet no more; a belief, which did not ari&s;e merely from fore&s;een circum&s;tances, for, tho' the length of the journey &s;he was about to commence, the uncer|tainty as to the period of her return, together with the prohibi|tions &s;he had received, &s;eemed to ju&s;tify it, &s;he yielded al&s;o to an impre&s;&s;ion, which &s;he mi&s;took for a pre-&s;entiment, that &s;he was going from Valancourt for ever. How dreadful to her imagina|tion, too, was the di&s;tance that would &s;eparate them&mdash;the Alps, tho&s;e tremendous barriers! would ri&s;e, and whole countries ex|tend between the regions where each mu&s;t exi&s;t! To live in ad|joining provinces, to live even in the &s;ame country, though with|out &s;eeing him, was comparative happine&s;s to the conviction of this dreadful length of di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Her mind was at length &s;o much agitated by the con&s;idera|tion of her &s;tate, and the belief, that &s;he had &s;een Valancourt for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> la&s;t time, that &s;he &s;uddenly became very faint, and, looking round the chamber for &s;omething that might revive her, &s;he ob|&s;erved the ca&s;ements, and had ju&s;t &s;trength to throw one open, near which &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf. The air recalled her &s;pirits, and the &s;till moonlight, that fell upon the elms of a long avenue, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the window, &s;omewhat &s;oothed them, and determined her to try whether exerci&s;e and the open air would not relieve the inten&s;e pain that bound her temples. In the chateau all was &s;till; and, pa&s;&s;ing down the great &s;tairca&s;e into the hall, from whence a pa&s;&s;age led immediately to the garden, &s;he &s;oftly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">heard, as &s;he thought, unlocked the door, and entered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Emily pa&s;&s;ed on with &s;teps now hurried, and now falter|ing, as, deceived by the &s;hadows among the trees, &s;he fancied &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome per&s;on move in the di&s;tant per&s;pective, and feared that it was a &s;py of Madame Montoni. Her de&s;ire, however, to re|vi&s;it the pavilion, where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many happy hours with Valancourt, and had admired with him the exten&s;ive pro&s;|pect over Languedoc and her native Ga&s;cony, overcame her ap|prehen&s;ion of being ob&s;erved, and &s;he moved on towards the ter|race, which, running along the upper garden, commanded the whole of the lower one, and communicated with it by a flight of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;teps, that terminated the avenue. Having reached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;teps, &s;he pau&s;ed a moment to look round, for her di&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the chateau now increa&s;ed the fear, which the &s;tillne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the hour awakened. But, perceiving nothing that could ju&s;tify it, &s;he a&s;cended to the terrace, where the moonlight
<PB N="156" REF="029378_0079_0FE07FBDCF6FCC28">
&s;hewed the long broad walk, with the pavilion, at its extremity, while the rays &s;ilvered the foliage of the high trees and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that bordered it on the right, and the tufted &s;ummits of tho&s;e, that ro&s;e to a level with the balu&s;trade on the left, from the gar|den below. Her di&s;tance from the chateau again alarming her, &s;he pau&s;ed to li&s;ten; the night was &s;o calm, that no &s;ound could have e&s;caped her, but &s;he heard only the plaintive &s;weetne&s;s of the nightingale, with the light &s;hiver of the leaves, and &s;he pur|&s;ued her way towards the pavilion, having reached which, its ob|&s;curity did not prevent the emotion, that a fuller view of its well known &s;cene would have excited. The lattices were thrown back, and &s;hewed beyond their embowered arch the moonlight land&s;cape, &s;hadowy and &s;oft; its groves, and plains extending gradually and indi&s;tinctly to the eye, its di&s;tant mountains catch|ing a &s;tronger gleam, and the nearer river reflecting the moon, and trembling to her rays.</P>
<P>Emily, as &s;he approached the lattice, was &s;en&s;ible of the fea|tures of this &s;cene only as they &s;erved to bring Valancourt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> immediately to her fancy. "Ah!" &s;aid &s;he with a heavy &s;igh, as &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair by the window, "how often have we &s;at together in this &s;pot&mdash;often have looked upon that land&s;cape! Never, never more &s;hall we view it together&mdash;never, never more, perhaps, &s;hall we look upon each other!"</P>
<P>Her tears were &s;uddenly &s;topped by terror&mdash;a voice &s;poke near her in the pavilion; &s;he &s;hrieked&mdash;it &s;poke again, and &s;he di&s;|tingui&s;hed the well known tones of Valancourt. It was indeed Valancourt who &s;upported her in his arms! for &s;ome moments their emotion would not &s;uffer either to &s;peak. "Emily!" &s;aid Valancourt at length, as he pre&s;&s;ed her hand in his, "Emily!" and he was again &s;ilent, but the accent, in which he had pro|nounced her name, expre&s;&s;ed all his tenderne&s;s and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>"O my Emily!" he re&s;umed, after a long pau&s;e, "I do then &s;ee you once again, and hear again the &s;ound of that voice! I have haunted this place&mdash;the&s;e gardens, for, many&mdash;many nights, with a faint, very faint hope of &s;eeing you. This was the only chance that remained for me, and, thank heaven! it has at length &s;ucceeded&mdash;I am not condemned to ab&s;olute de&s;|pair!"</P>
<P>Emily &s;aid &s;omething, &s;he &s;carcely knew what, expre&s;&s;ive of her unalterable affection, and endeavoured to calm the agitation of his mind; but Valancourt could for &s;ometime only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> incoherent expre&s;&s;ions of his emotions; and, when he was &s;ome|what more compo&s;ed, he &s;aid, "I came hither, &s;oon after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="157" REF="029378_0079_0FE07FBDCF6FCC28">
and have been watching in the gardens, and in this pavilion ever &s;ince; for, though I had now given up all hope of &s;eeing you, I could not re&s;olve to tear my&s;elf from a place &s;o near to you, and &s;hould probably have lingered about the chateau till morn|ing dawned. O how heavenly the moments have pa&s;&s;ed, yet with what various emotion have they been marked, as I &s;ome|times thought I heard foot&s;teps, and fancied you were approach|ing, and then again&mdash;perceived only a dead and dreary &s;ilence! But, when you opened the door of the pavilion, and the darkne&s;s prevented my di&s;tingui&s;hing with certainty, whether it was my love&mdash;my heart beat &s;o &s;trongly with hopes and fears, that I could not &s;peak. The in&s;tant I heard the plaintive accents of your voice, my doubts vani&s;hed, but not my fears, till you &s;poke of me; then, lo&s;ing the apprehen&s;ion of alarming you in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of my emotion, I could no longer be &s;ilent. O Emily! the&s;e are moments, in which joy and grief &s;truggle &s;o powerfully for pre-eminence, that the heart can &s;carcely &s;upport the conte&s;t!"</P>
<P>Emily's heart acknowledged the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, but the joy &s;he felt on thus meeting Valancourt, at the very mo|ment when &s;he was lamenting, that they mu&s;t probably meet no more, &s;oon melted into grief, as reflection &s;tole over her thoughts, and imagination prompted vi&s;ions of the future. She &s;truggled to recover the calm dignity of mind, which was nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport her through this la&s;t interview, and which Val|ancourt found it utterly impo&s;&s;ible to attain, for the tran&s;ports of his joy changed abruptly into tho&s;e of &s;uffering, and he expre&s;|&s;ed in the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned language his horror of this &s;epara|tion, and his de&s;pair of their ever meeting again. Emily wept &s;ilently as &s;he li&s;tened to him, and then, trying to command her own di&s;tre&s;s, and to &s;ooth his, &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted every circum&s;tance that could lead to hope. But the energy of his fears led him in&s;tantly to detect the friendly fallacies, which &s;he endeavoured to im|po&s;e on her&s;elf and him, and to conjure up illu&s;ions too powerful for his rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"You are going from me," &s;aid he, "to a di&s;tant country, O how di&s;tant!&mdash;to new &s;ociety, new friends, new admirers, with people too, who will try to make you forget me, and to pro|mote new connections! How can I know this, and not know, that you will never return for me&mdash;never can be mine." His voice was &s;tifled by &s;ighs.</P>
<P>"You believe, then," &s;aid Emily, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the pangs I &s;uffer proceed from a trivial and temporary intere&s;t; you be|lieve&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="029378_0080_0FE07FCC5CBF9A98">
"Suffer!" interrupted Valancourt, "&s;uffer for me! O Emily, how &s;weet&mdash;how bitter are tho&s;e words; what comfort, what angui&s;h do they give! I ought not to doubt the &s;teadine&s;s of your affection, yet &s;uch is the incon&s;i&s;tency of real love, that it is always awake to &s;u&s;picion, however unrea&s;onable; always re|quiring new a&s;&s;urances from the object of its intere&s;t, and thus it is, that I always feel revived, as by a new conviction, when your words tell me I am dear to you; and wanting the&s;e, I relap&s;e into doubt, and too often into de&s;pondency." Then &s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, he exclaimed, "But what a wretch am I, thus to torture you, and in the&s;e moments, too! I, who ought to &s;up|port and comfort you!"</P>
<P>This reflection overcame Valancourt with tenderne&s;s, but, re|lap&s;ing into de&s;pondency, he again felt only for him&s;elf, and la|mented again this cruel &s;eparation, in a voice and words &s;o im|pa&s;&s;ioned, that Emily could no longer &s;truggle to repre&s;s her own grief or to &s;ooth his. Valancourt, between the&s;e emotions of love and pity, lo&s;t the power, and almo&s;t the wi&s;h, of repre&s;&s;ing his agitation; and in the intervals of convul&s;ive &s;obs, he, at one moment, ki&s;&s;ed away her tears, then told her cruelly, that po&s;&s;ibly &s;he might never again weep for him, and then tried to &s;peak more calmly, but only exclaimed, "O Emily&mdash;my heart will break!&mdash;I cannot&mdash;cannot leave you! Now&mdash;I gaze upon that countenance, now I hold you in my arms! a little while, and all this will appear a dream. I &s;hall look, and cannot &s;ee you; &s;hall try to recollect your features&mdash;and the impre&s;&s;ion will be fled from my imagination; to hear the tones of your voice, and even memory will be &s;ilent! I cannot, cannot leave you! Why &s;hould we confide the happine&s;s of our whole lives to the will of people, who have no right to interrupt, and, except in giving you to me, have no power to promote it? O Emily! venture to tru&s;t your own heart, venture to be mine forever!" His voice trembled, and he was &s;ilent; Emily continued to weep, and was &s;ilent al&s;o, when Valancourt proceeded to propo&s;e an immediate marriage, and that, at an early hour on the follow|ing morning, &s;he &s;hould quit Madame Montoni's hou&s;e, and be conducted by him to the church of the Augu&s;tines, where a friar &s;hould await to unite them.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence, with which &s;he li&s;tened to a propo&s;al, dictated by love and de&s;pair, and enforced at a moment, when it &s;eemed &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for her to oppo&s;e it; when her heart was &s;often|ed by the &s;orrows of a &s;eparation, that might be eternal, and her rea&s;on ob&s;cured by the illu&s;ions of love and terror, encouraged

him to hope, that it would not be rejected. "Speak, my Emily!" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Valancourt eagerly, "let me hear your voice, let me hear you confirm my fate." She &s;poke not; her cheek was cold, and her &s;en&s;es &s;eemed to fail her, but &s;he did not faint. To Valancourt's terrified imagination &s;he appeared to be dying; he called upon her name, ro&s;e to go to the chateau for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and then, recollecting her &s;ituation, feared to go, or to leave her for a moment.</P>
<P>After a few minutes, &s;he drew a deep &s;igh, and began to re|vive. The conflict &s;he had &s;uffered, between love and the duty &s;he at pre&s;ent owed to her father's &s;i&s;ter; her repugnance to a clande&s;tine marriage, her fear of emerging on the world with embarra&s;&s;ments, &s;uch as might ultimately involve the object of her affection in mi&s;ery and repentance; all this various intere&s;t was too powerful for a mind, already enervated by &s;orrow, and her rea&s;on had &s;uffered a tran&s;ient &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. But duty, and good &s;en&s;e, however hard the conflict, at length, triumphed over affection and mournful pre&s;entiment; above all, &s;he dreaded to involve Valancourt in ob&s;curity and vain regret, which &s;he &s;aw, or thought &s;he &s;aw, mu&s;t be the too certain con&s;equence of a marriage in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; and &s;he acted, perhaps, with &s;omewhat more than female fortitude, when &s;he re&s;olved to endure a pre&s;ent, rather than provoke a di&s;tant misfortune.</P>
<P>With a candour, that proved how truly &s;he e&s;teemed and lov|ed him, and which endeared her to him, if po&s;&s;ible more than ever, &s;he told Valancourt all her rea&s;ons for rejecting his propo|&s;als. Tho&s;e, which influenced her concerning his future wel|fare, he in&s;tantly refuted, or rather contradicted; but they awak|ened tender con&s;iderations for her, which the frenzy of pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;pair had concealed before, and love, which had but lately prompted him to propo&s;e a clande&s;tine and immediate marriage, now induced him to renounce it. The triumph was almo&s;t too much for his heart; for Emily's &s;ake, he endeavoured to &s;tifle his grief, but the &s;welling angui&s;h would not be re&s;trained.&mdash;"O Emily!" &s;aid he, "I mu&s;t leave you&mdash;I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> leave you, and I know it is for ever."</P>
<P>Convul&s;ive &s;obs again interrupted his words, and they wept together in &s;ilence, till Emily, recollecting the danger of being di&s;covered, and the impropriety of prolonging an interview, which might &s;ubject her to cen&s;ure, &s;ummoned all her fortitude to utter a la&s;t farewel.</P>
<P>"Stay!" &s;aid Valancourt, "I conjure you &s;tay&punc; for I have much to tell you. The agitation of my mind has hitherto &s;uf|fered
<PB N="160" REF="029378_0081_0FE07FD144517FD0">
me to &s;peak only on the &s;ubject that occupied it;&mdash;I have forborne to mention a doubt of much importance, partly, left it &s;hould appear as if I told it with an ungenerous view of alarm|ing you, into compliance with my late propo&s;al."</P>
<P>Emily, much agitated did not leave Valancourt, but &s;he led him from the pavilion, and, as they walked upon the terrace, he proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>"This Montoni: I have heard &s;ome &s;trange hints concerning him. Are you certain he is of Madame Que&s;nel's family, and that his fortune is what it appears to be?"</P>
<P>"I have no rea&s;on to doubt either," replied Emily, in a voice of alarm. "Of the fir&s;t, indeed, I cannot doubt, but I have no certain means of judging of the latter, and I entreat you will tell me all you have heard."</P>
<P>"That I certainly will, but it is very imperfect, and un&s;atis|factory information. I gathered it by an accident from an Ital|ian, who was &s;peaking to another per&s;on of this Montoni. They were talking of his marriage; the Italian &s;aid, that if he was the per&s;on he meant, he was not likely to make Madame Cheron happy. He proceeded to &s;peak of him in general terms of di&s;|like, and then gave &s;ome particular hints, concerning his char|acter, that excited my curio&s;ity, and I ventured to a&s;k him a few que&s;tions. He was re&s;erved in his replies, but after he&s;ita|ting for &s;ome time, he owned, that he had under&s;tood abroad, that Montoni was a man of de&s;perate fortune and character.&mdash;He &s;aid &s;omething of a ca&s;tle of Montoni's, &s;ituated among the Apennines, and of &s;ome &s;trange circum&s;tances, that might be mentioned, as to his former mode of life. I pre&s;&s;ed him to in|form me further, but I believe the &s;trong intere&s;t I felt was vi|&s;ible in my manner, and alarmed him; for no entreaties could prevail with him to give any explanation of the circum&s;tances he had alluded to, or to mention any thing further concerning Montoni. I ob&s;erved to him, that, if Montoni was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ca&s;tle in the Apennines, it appeared from &s;uch a circum&s;tance, that he was of &s;ome family, and al&s;o &s;eemed to contradict the re|port, that he was a man of entirely broken fortunes. He &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k his head, and looked as if he could have &s;aid a great deal, but made no reply.</P>
<P>"A hope of learning &s;omething more &s;atisfactory, or more po&s;itive, detained me in his company a con&s;iderable time, and I renewed the &s;ubject repeatedly, but the Italian wrapped him&s;elf up in re&s;erve, &s;aid&mdash;that what he had mentioned he had caught only from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> report, and that reports frequently aro&s;e
<PB N="161" REF="029378_0081_0FE07FD144517FD0">
from per&s;onal malice, and were very little to be depended upon. I forbore to pre&s;s the &s;ubject farther, &s;ince it was obvious that he was alarmed for the con&s;equence of what he had already &s;aid, and I was compelled to remain in uncertainty on a point where &s;u&s;pen&s;e is almo&s;t intolerable. Think, Emily, what I mu&s;t &s;uf|fer to &s;ee you depart for a foreign country, committed to the power of a man of &s;uch doubtful character as is this Montoni! But I will not alarm you unnece&s;&s;arily; it is po&s;&s;ible, as the Ital|ian &s;aid, at fir&s;t, that this is not the Montoni he alluded to.&mdash;Yet, Emily, con&s;ider well before you re&s;olve to commit your&s;elf to him. O! I mu&s;t not tru&s;t my&s;elf to &s;peak&mdash;or I &s;hall re|nounce all the motives, which &s;o lately influenced me to re&s;ign the hope of your becoming mine immediately,"</P>
<P>Valancourt walked upon the terrace with hurried &s;teps, while Emily remained leaning on the balu&s;trade in deep thought.&mdash;The information &s;he had ju&s;t received excited perhaps, more alarm than it could ju&s;tify, and rai&s;ed once more the conflict of contra&s;ted intere&s;ts. She had never liked Montoni. The fire and keenne&s;s of his eye, its proud exultation, its bold fiercene&s;s, its &s;ullen watchfulne&s;s, as occa&s;ion, and even &s;light occa&s;ion, had called forth the latent &s;oul, &s;he had often ob&s;erved with emotion; while from the u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance &s;he had al|ways &s;hrunk. From &s;uch ob&s;ervations &s;he was the more inclin|ed to believe, that it was this Montoni, of whom the Italian had uttered his &s;u&s;picious hints. The thought of being &s;olely in his power, in a foreign land, was terrifying to her, but it was not by terror alone that &s;he was urged to an immediate marriage with Valancourt. The tendere&s;t love had already pleaded his cau&s;e, but had been unable to overcome her opinion, as to her duty, her di&s;intere&s;ted con&s;iderations for Valancourt, and the delicacy, which made her revolt from a clande&s;tine union. It was not to be expected, that a vague terror would be more powerful, than the united influence of love and grief. But it recal|led all their energy, and rendered a &s;econd conque&s;t nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>With Valancourt, who&s;e imagination was now awake to the &s;ugge&s;tion of every pa&s;&s;ion; who&s;e apprehen&s;ions for Emily had acquired &s;trength by the mere mention of them, and became every in&s;tant more powerful, as his mind brooded over them&mdash;with Valancourt no &s;econd conque&s;t was attainable. He thought he &s;aw in the cleare&s;t light, and love a&s;&s;i&s;ted the fear, that this journey to Italy would involve Emily in mi&s;ery; he determined, therefore to per&s;evere in oppo&s;ing it, and in conjuring her to be|&s;tow upon him the title of her lawful protector.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="029378_0082_0FE07FDF581B3808">
"Emily!" &s;aid he, with &s;olemn earne&s;tne&s;s, "this is no time for &s;crupulous di&s;tinctions, for weighing the dubious and com|paratively trifling circum&s;tances that may affect our future com|fort. I now &s;ee, much more clearly than before, the train of &s;e|rious dangers, you are going to encounter with a man of Mon|toni's character. Tho&s;e dark hints of the Italian &s;poke much, but not more than the idea I have of Montoni's di&s;po&s;ition, as exhibited even in his countenance. I think I &s;ee at this moment all that could have been hinted, written there. He is the Ital|ian, whom I fear, and I conjure you for your own &s;ake, as well as for mine, to prevent the evils I &s;hudder to fore&s;ee. O Emily! let my tenderne&s;s, my arms withhold you from them&mdash;give me the right to defend you!"</P>
<P>Emily only &s;ighed, while Valancourt proceeded to remon&s;trate and to entreat with all the energy that love and apprehen&s;ion could in&s;pire. But, as his imagination magnified to her the po&s;|&s;ible evils &s;he was going to meet, the mi&s;ts of her own fancy be|gan to di&s;&s;ipate, and allowed her to di&s;tingui&s;h the exaggerated images, which impo&s;ed on his rea&s;on. She con&s;idered, that there was no proof of Montoni being the per&s;on, whom the &s;tranger had meant; that, even if he was &s;o, the Italian had no|ticed his character and broken fortunes merely from report; and that, though the countenance of Montoni &s;eemed to give proba|bility to a part of the rumour, it was not by &s;uch circum&s;tances that an implicit belief of it could be ju&s;tified. The&s;e con&s;idera|tions would probably not have ari&s;en &s;o di&s;tinctly to her mind at this time, had not the terrors of Valancourt pre&s;ented to her &s;uch obvious exaggerations of her danger, as incited her to di&s;|tru&s;t the fallacies of pa&s;&s;ion. But while &s;he endeavoured in the gentle&s;t manner to convince him of his error, &s;he plunged him into a new one. His voice and countenance changed to an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of dark de&s;pair. "Emily!" &s;aid he, "this, this mo|ment is the bittere&s;t that is yet come to me. You do not&mdash;can|not love me!&mdash;It would be impo&s;&s;ible for you to rea&s;on thus cooly, thus deliberately, if you did. I, <HI>I</HI> am torn with angui&s;h at the pro&s;pect of our &s;eparation, and of the evils that may await you in con&s;equence of it; I would encounter any hazards to pre|vent it&mdash;to &s;ave you. No! Emily, no!&mdash;you cannot love me."</P>
<P>"We have now little time to wa&s;te in exclamation, or a&s;&s;er|tion," &s;aid Emily, endeavouring to conceal her emotion: "if you are yet to learn how dear you are, and ever mu&s;t be, to my heart, no a&s;&s;urances of mine can give you conviction."</P>
<P>The la&s;t words faltered on her lips, and her tears flowed fa&s;t, Tho&s;e words and tears brought, once more, and with in&s;tantane|ous
<PB N="163" REF="029378_0082_0FE07FDF581B3808">
force, conviction of her love to Valancourt. He could only exclaim, "Emily! Emily!" and weep over the hand he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips; but &s;he, after &s;ome moments, again rou&s;ed her&s;elf from the indulgence of &s;orrow, and &s;aid, "I mu&s;t leave you; it is late, and my ab&s;ence from the chateau may be di&s;covered. Think of me&mdash;love me&mdash;when I am far away; the belief of this will be my comfort!"</P>
<P>"Think of you!&mdash;love you!" exclaimed Valancourt.</P>
<P>"Try to moderate the&s;e tran&s;ports," &s;aid Emily, "for my &s;ake, try."</P>
<P>"For your &s;ake!"</P>
<P>"Yes, for my &s;ake," replied Emily, in a tremulous voice, "I cannot leave you thus!"</P>
<P>"Then do not leave me," &s;aid Valancourt, with quickne&s;s. "Why &s;hould we part, or part for longer than till to morrow?"</P>
<P>"I am, indeed I am, unequal to the&s;e moments," replied Emi|ly, "you tear my heart, but I never can con&s;ent to this ha&s;ty, imprudent propo&s;al!"</P>
<P>"If we could command our time, my Emily, it &s;hould not be thus ha&s;ty; we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to circum&s;tances."</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t, indeed! I have already told you all my heart&mdash;my &s;pirits are gone. You allowed the force of my objections, till your tenderne&s;s called up vague terrors, which have given us both unnece&s;&s;ary angui&s;h. Spare me! do not oblige me to re|peat the rea&s;ons I have already urged."</P>
<P>"Spare you!" cried Valancourt, "I am a wretch&mdash;a very wretch, that have felt only for my&s;elf!&mdash;I! who ought to have &s;hewn the fortitude of a man, who ought to have &s;upported you, I! have increa&s;ed your &s;ufferings by the conduct of a child! Forgive me, Emily! think of the di&s;traction of my mind now that I am about to part with all that is dear to me&mdash;and forgive me! When you are gone, I &s;hall recollect with bitter remor&s;e what I have made you &s;uffer, and &s;hall wi&s;h in vain that I could &s;ee you, if only for a moment that I might &s;ooth your grief."</P>
<P>Tears again interrupted his voice, and Emily wept with him. "I will &s;hew my&s;elf more worthy of your love," &s;aid Valancourt, at length; "I will not prolong the&s;e moments. My Emily&mdash;my own Emily! never forget me! God knows when we &s;hall meet again! I re&s;ign you to his care.&mdash;O God!&mdash;O God!&mdash;protect and ble&s;s her!"</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his heart. Emily &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s on his bo&s;om; and neither wept, nor &s;poke. Valancourt, now commanding his own di&s;tre&s;s, tried to comfort and re-a&s;&s;ure her,
<PB N="164" REF="029378_0083_0FE07FE5114DEA98">
but &s;he appeared totally unaffected by what he &s;aid, and a &s;igh, which &s;he uttered now and then, was all that proved &s;he had not fainted.</P>
<P>He &s;upported her &s;lowly towards the chateau, weeping and &s;peaking to her; but &s;he an&s;wered only in &s;ighs, till having reached the gate that terminated the avenue, &s;he &s;eemed to have recovered her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and, looking round, perceived how near they were to the chateau. "We mu&s;t part here," &s;aid &s;he, &s;topping, "Why prolong the&s;e moments? Teach me the forti|tude I have forgot."</P>
<P>Valancourt &s;truggled to a&s;&s;ume a compo&s;ed air. "Farewel, my love!" &s;aid he, in a voice of &s;olemn tenderne&s;s&mdash;"tru&s;t me we &s;hall meet again, meet for each other, meet to part no more!" His voice faltered, but, recovering it, he proceeded in a firmer tone. "You know not what I &s;hall &s;uffer, till I hear from you; I &s;hall omit no opportunity of conveying to you my letters, yet I tremble to think how few may occur. And tru&s;t me, love, for your dear &s;ake, I will try to bear this ab&s;ence with fortitude. O how little I have &s;hewn to night!"</P>
<P>"Farewel!" &s;aid Emily faintly. "When you are gone, I &s;hall think of many things I would have &s;aid to you." "And I of many, many!" &s;aid Valancourt; "I never left you yet, that I did not immediately remember &s;ome que&s;tion, or &s;ome entreaty, or &s;ome circum&s;tance, concerning my love, that I earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to mention, and feel wretched becau&s;e I could not. O Emily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this countenance, on which I now gaze&mdash;will, in a moment, be gone from my eyes, and not all the efforts of fancy will be able to recall it with exactne&s;s. O! what an infinite difference be|tween this moment and the next! <HI>Now,</HI> I am in your pre&s;ence, can behold you! <HI>then,</HI> all will be a dreary blank&mdash;and I &s;hall be a wanderer, exiled from my only home!"</P>
<P>Valancourt again pre&s;&s;ed her to his heart, and held her there in &s;ilence, weeping. Tears once again calmed her oppre&s;&s;ed mind. They again bade each other farewel, lingered a moment, and then parted. Valancourt &s;eemed to force him&s;elf from the &s;pot; he pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily up the avenue, and Emily, as &s;he moved &s;lowly towards the chateau, heard his di&s;tant &s;teps. She li&s;tened to the &s;ounds, as they &s;unk fainter and fainter, till the melancholy &s;tillne&s;s of night alone remained; and then hurried to her cham|ber, to &s;eek repo&s;e, which, alas! was fled from her wretchedne&s;s.</P>

<P>THE carriages were at the gates at an early hour; the bu&s;tle of the dome&s;tics, pa&s;&s;ing to and fro in the galleries, awak|ened Emily from hara&s;&s;ing &s;lumbers: her unquiet mind had, during the night, pre&s;ented her with terrific images and ob&s;cure circum&s;tances, concerning her affection and her future life. She now endeavoured to cha&s;e away the impre&s;&s;ions they had left on her fancy; but from imaginary evils &s;he awoke to the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of real ones. Recollecting that &s;he had parted with Valan|court, perhaps for ever, her heart &s;ickened as memory revived. But &s;he tried to di&s;mi&s;s the di&s;mal forebodings that crowded on her mind, and to re&s;train the &s;orrow which &s;he could not &s;ub|due; efforts which diffu&s;ed over the &s;ettled melancholy of her countenance an expre&s;&s;ion of tempered re&s;ignation, as a thin veil, thrown over the features of beauty, renders them more intere&s;ting by a partial concealment. But Madame Montoni ob&s;erved nothing in this countenance except its unu&s;ual palene&s;s, which attracted her cen&s;ure. She told her niece, that &s;he had been in|dulging in fanciful &s;orrows, and begged &s;he would have more regard for decorum, than to let the world &s;ee that &s;he could not renounce an improper attachment; at which Emily's pale cheek became flu&s;hed with crim&s;on, but it was the blu&s;h of pride, and &s;he made no an&s;wer. Soon after, Montoni entered the breakfa&s;t room, &s;poke little, and &s;eemed impatient to be gone.</P>
<P>The windows of this room opened upon the garden. As Emily pa&s;&s;ed them, &s;he &s;aw the &s;pot where &s;he had parted with Valan|court on the preceding night: the remembrance pre&s;&s;ed heavily on her heart, and &s;he turned ha&s;tily away from the object that awakened it.</P>
<P>The baggage being at length adju&s;ted, the travellers entered their carriages, and Emily would have left the chateau without one &s;igh of regret, had it not been &s;ituated in the neighbourhood of Valancourt's re&s;idence.</P>
<P>From a little eminence &s;he looked back upon Tholou&s;e, and the far-&s;een plains of Ga&s;cony, beyond which the broken &s;um|mits of the Pyrenees appeared on the di&s;tant horizon, lighted up by a morning &s;un. "Dear plea&s;ant mountains!" &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "how long may it be ere I &s;ee ye again, and how
<PB N="166" REF="029378_0084_0FE07FEF31882148">
much may happen to make me mi&s;erable in the interval! Oh, could I now be certain, that I &s;hould ever return to ye, and find that Valancourt &s;till lived for me, I &s;hould go in peace! He will &s;till gaze on ye, gaze when I am far away!"</P>
<P>The trees, that impended over the high banks of the road and formed a line of per&s;pective with the di&s;tant country, now threat|ened to exclude the view of them; but the bluei&s;h mountains &s;till appeared beyond the dark foliage, and Emily continued to lean from the coach window, till at length the clo&s;ing branches &s;hut them from her &s;ight.</P>
<P>Another object &s;oon caught her attention. She had &s;carcely looked at a per&s;on who walked along the bank, with his hat, in which was the military feather, drawn over his eyes, before, at the &s;ound of wheels, he &s;uddenly turned, and &s;he perceived that it was Valancourt him&s;elf, who waved his hand, &s;prung into the road, and through the window of the carriage put a letter into her hand. He endeavoured to &s;mile through the de&s;pair that over|&s;pread his countenance as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on. The remembrance of that &s;mile &s;eemed impre&s;&s;ed on Emily's mind for ever. She leaned from the window, and &s;aw him on a knoll of the broken bank, lean|ing again&s;t the high trees that waved over him, and pur&s;uing the carriage with his eyes. He waved his hand, and &s;he continued to gaze till di&s;tance confu&s;ed his figure, and at length another turn of the road entirely &s;eparated him from her &s;ight.</P>
<P>Having &s;topped to take up Signor Cavigni at a chateau on the road, the travellers, of whom Emily was di&s;repectfully &s;eated with Madame Montoni's woman in a &s;econd carriage, pur&s;ued their way over the plains of Languedoc. The pre&s;ence of this &s;ervant re&s;trained Emily from reading Valancourt's letter, for &s;he did not choo&s;e to expo&s;e the emotions it might occa&s;ion, to the ob&s;ervation of any per&s;on. Yet &s;uch was her wi&s;h to read this his la&s;t communication, that her trembling hand was every mo|ment on the point of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eaking the &s;eal.</P>
<P>At length they reached the village, where they &s;taid only to change hor&s;es, without alighting, and it was not till they &s;top|ped to dine, that Emily had an opportunity of reading the letter. Though &s;he had never doubted the &s;incerity of Valancourt's af|fection, the fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances &s;he now received of it revived her &s;pirits; &s;he wept over his letter in tenderne&s;s, laid it by to be referred to when they &s;hould be particularly depre&s;&s;ed, and then thought of him with much le&s;s angui&s;h than &s;he had done &s;ince they parted. Among &s;ome other reque&s;ts, which were intere&s;t|ing to her, becau&s;e expre&s;&s;ive of his tenderne&s;s, and becau&s;e a

compliance with them &s;eemed to annihilate for a while the pain of ab&s;ence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e entreated &s;he would always think of him at &s;un&s;et. "You will then meet me in thought," &s;aid he; "I &s;hall con|&s;tantly watch the &s;un&s;et, and I &s;hall be happy in the belief, that your eyes are fixed upon the &s;ame object with mine, and that our minds are conver&s;ing.

<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay with what emotion Emily, on this evening, watched the declining &s;un, over a long extent of plains, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n which &s;he &s;aw it &s;et without interruption, and &s;ink towards the province which Valancourt inhabited. After this hour her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ind became far more tranquil and re&s;igned, than it had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ce the marriage of Montoni and her aunt.</P>
<P>During &s;everal days the travellers journeyed over the plains of Languedoc; and then entering Dauphiny, and winding for &s;ome|time among the mountains of that romantic province, they quit|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> their carriages and began to a&s;cend the Alps. And here &s;uch &s;cenes of &s;ublimity opened upon them as no colours of lan|guage mu&s;t dare to paint! Emily's mind was even &s;o much en|gaged with new and wonderful images, that they &s;ometimes bani&s;hed the idea of Valancourt, though they more frequently revived it. The&s;e brought to her recollection the pro&s;pects among the Pyrenees, which they had admired together, and had believed nothing could excel in grandeur. How often did &s;he wi&s;h to expre&s;s to him the new emotions which this a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenery awakened, and that he could partake of them! Some|times too &s;he endeavoured to anticipate his remarks, and almo&s;t imagined him pre&s;ent. She &s;eemed to have ari&s;en into another world, and to have left every trifling thought, every trifling &s;en|timent, in that below; tho&s;e only of grandeur and &s;ublimity now dilated her mind, and elevated the affections of her heart.</P>
<P>With what emotions of &s;ublimity, &s;oftened by tenderne&s;s, did &s;he meet Valancourt in thought, at the cu&s;tomary hour of &s;un&s;et, when, wandering among the Alps, &s;he watched the glorious orb &s;ink amid their &s;ummits, his la&s;t tints die away on their &s;nowy points, and a &s;olemn ob&s;curity &s;teal over the &s;cene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> And when the la&s;t gleam had faded, &s;he turned her eyes from the we&s;t with &s;omewhat of the melancholy regret that is experienced after the departure of a beloved friend; while the&s;e lonely feelings were heightened by the &s;preading gloom, and by the low &s;ounds, heard only when darkne&s;s confines attention, which make the general &s;tillne&s;s more impre&s;&s;ive&mdash;leaves &s;hook by the air, the la&s;t

&s;igh of the breeze that lingers after &s;un&s;et, or the murmur of di&s;|tant &s;treams.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t days of this journey among the Alps, the &s;cen|ery exhibited a wonderful mixture of &s;olitude and inhabitation, of cultivation and barrenne&s;s. On the edge of tremendous pre|cipices, and within the hollow of the cliffs, below which the clouds often floated, were &s;een villages, &s;pires, and convent tow|ers; while green pa&s;tures and vineyards &s;pread their hues at the feet of perpendicular rocks of marble, or of granite, who&s;e points, tufted with alpine &s;hrubs, or exhibiting only ma&s;&s;y crags, ro&s;e above each other, till they terminated in the &s;now-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">opt moun|tain, whence the torrent fell, that thundered along the valley.</P>
<P>The &s;now was not yet melted on the &s;ummit of Mount Cenis, over which the travellers pa&s;&s;ed; but Emily, as &s;he looked up|on its clear lake and extended plain, &s;urrounded by broken cliffs, &s;aw, in imagination, the verdant beauty it would exhibit when the &s;nows &s;hould be gone, and the &s;hepherds, leading up the mid&s;ummer flocks from Piedmont, to pa&s;ture on its flowery &s;ummit, &s;hould add Arcadian figures to Arcadian land&s;cape.</P>
<P>As &s;he de&s;cended on the Italian &s;ide, the precipices became &s;till more tremendous, and the pro&s;pects &s;till more wild and maje&s;tic, over which the &s;hifting lights threw all the pomp of colouring. Emily delighted to ob&s;erve the &s;nowy tops of the mountains under the pa&s;&s;ing influence of the day, blu&s;hing with morning, glowing with the brightne&s;s of noon, or ju&s;t tinted with the purple evening. The haunt of man could now only be di&s;covered by the &s;imple hut of the &s;hepherd and the hunter, or by the rough pine bridge thrown acro&s;s the torrent, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the latter in his cha&s;e of the chamois over crags where, but for this ve&s;tige of man, it would have been believed only the cha|mois or the wolf dared to venture.

<P>Emily, often as &s;he travelled among the clouds, watched in &s;ilent awe their billowy &s;urges rolling below; &s;ometimes, wholly clo&s;ing upon the &s;cene, they appeared like a world of chaos, and, at others, &s;preading thinly, they opened and admitted par|tial catches of the land&s;cape, the torrent, who&s;e a&s;tounding roar had never failed, tumbling down the rocky cha&s;m, hugh cliffs white with &s;now, or the dark &s;ummits of the pine fore&s;ts, that &s;tretched mid-way down the mountains. But who may de&s;cribe her rapture, when, having pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;ea of vapour, &s;he caught a fir&s;t view of Italy; when, from the ridge of one of tho&s;e tremendous precipices that hang upon Mount Cenis and guard the entrance of that enchanting country, &s;he looked down through the lower clouds, and, as they floated away, &s;aw the gra&s;&s;y vales of Piedmont at her feet, and, beyond, the plains of Lom|bardy extending to the farthe&s;t di&s;tance, at which appeared, on the faint horizon, the doubtful towers of Turin?</P>
<P>The &s;olitary grandeur of the objects that immediately &s;ur|rounded her, the mountain-region towering above, the deep pre|cipices that fell beneath, the waving blackne&s;s of the fore&s;ts of pine and oak, which &s;kirted their feet, or hung within their re|ce&s;&s;es, the headlong torrents that, da&s;hing among their cliffs, &s;ometimes appeared like a cloud of mi&s;t, at others like a &s;heet of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, the&s;e were features which received a higher character of &s;ub|limity from the repo&s;ing beauty of the Italian land&s;cape below, &s;tretching to the wide horizon, where the &s;ame melting blue tint &s;eemed to unite earth and &s;ky.</P>

Meanwhile the carriers, having come to a landing-place, &s;top|ped to re&s;t, and the travellers being &s;eated on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a cliff, Montoni and Cavigni renewed a di&s;pute concerning Hannibal's pa&s;&s;age over the Alps, Montoni contending that he entered Italy by way of Mount Cenis, and Cavigni that he pa&s;&s;ed over Mount St. Bernard. The &s;ubject brought to Emily's imagination the di&s;a&s;ters he had &s;uffered in this bold and perilous adventure.&mdash;She &s;aw his va&s;t armies winding among the defiles, and over the tremendous cliffs of the mountains, which at night were lighted up by his fires, or by the torches which he cau&s;ed to be carried when he pur&s;ued his indefatigable march. In the eye of fancy, &s;he perceived the gleam of arms through the du&s;kine&s;s of night, the glitter of &s;pears and helmets, and the banners floating dimly on the twilight; while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and then the bla&s;t of a di&s;tant trum|pet echoed along the deule, and the &s;ignal was an&s;wered by a momentary cla&s;h of arms. She looked with horror upon the mountaineers, perched on the higher cliffs, a&s;&s;ailing the troops below with broken fragments of the mountain; on &s;oldiers and elephants tumbling headlong down the lower precipices; and, as &s;he li&s;tened to the rebounding rocks, that followed their fall, the terrors of fancy yielded to tho&s;e of reality, and &s;he &s;hudder|ed to behold her&s;elf on the dizzy height, whence &s;he had pictur|ed the de&s;cent of others.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni, meantime, as &s;he looked upon Italy, was contemplating in imagination the &s;plendour of palaces and the grandeur of ca&s;tles, &s;uch as &s;he believed &s;he was going to be mi&s;tre&s;s of at Venice and in the Apennine, and &s;he became, in idea, little le&s;s than a prince&s;s. Being no longer under the alarms which had deterred her from giving entertainments to the beauties of Tholou&s;e, whom Montoni had mentioned with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>eclat</HI> to his own vanity than credit to their di&s;cretion, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">egard to truth, &s;he determined to give concerts, though &s;he had neither ear nor ta&s;te for mu&s;ic; <HI>conver&s;azioni,</HI> though &s;he had no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for conver&s;ation; and to outvie, if po&s;&s;ible, in the gaieties of her parties and the magnificence of her liveries, all the nobles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Venice.

<P><PB N="171" REF="029378_0086_0FE08002310FD850">
The travellers, as they de&s;cended, gradually, exchanged the region of winter for the genial warmth and beauty of &s;pring.&mdash;The &s;ky began to a&s;&s;ume that &s;erene and beautiful tint peculiar to the climate of Italy; patches of young verdure, fragrant &s;hrubs and flowers looked gaily among the rocks, often fringing their rugged brows, or hanging in tufts from their broken &s;ides; and the buds of the oak and mountain-a&s;h were expanding into foliage. De&s;cending lower, the orange and the myrtle, every now and then, appeared in &s;ome &s;unny nook, with their yellow blo&s;&s;oms peeping from among the dark green of their leaves, and mingling with the &s;carlet flowers of the pomegranate and the paler ones of the arbutus, that ran mantling to the crags above; while, lower &s;till, &s;pread the pa&s;tures of Piedmont, where early flocks were cropping the luxuriant herbage of &s;pring.</P>
<P>The river Doria, which, ri&s;ing on the &s;ummit of Mount Ce|nis, had da&s;hed for many leagues over the precipices that bor|dered the road, now began to a&s;&s;ume a le&s;s impetuous, though &s;carcely le&s;s romantic character, as it approached the green val|lies of Piedmont, into which the travellers de&s;cended with the evening &s;un; and Emily found her&s;elf once more amid the tran|quil beauty of pa&s;toral &s;cenery; among flocks and herds, and &s;lopes tufted with woods of lively verdure and with beautiful &s;hrubs, &s;uch as &s;he had often &s;een waving luxuriantly over the Alps above. The verdure of the pa&s;turage, now varied with the hues of early flowers, among which were yellow ranunculu&s;es and pan&s;ey violets of delicious fragrance, &s;he had never &s;een ex|celled. Emily almo&s;t wi&s;hed to become a pea&s;ant of Piedmont, to inhabit one of the plea&s;ant embowered cottages which &s;he &s;aw peeping beneath the cliffs, and to pa&s;s her carele&s;s hours among tho&s;e romantic land&s;capes. To the hours, the months, &s;he was to pa&s;s under the dominion of Montoni, &s;he looked with ap|prehen&s;ion; while tho&s;e which were departed &s;he remembered with regret and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent &s;cenes her fancy often gave her the figure of Valancourt, whom &s;he &s;aw on a point of the cliffs, gazing with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">we and admiration on the imagery around him; or wandering pen&s;ively along the vale below, frequently pau&s;ing to look back upon the &s;cenery, and then, his countenance glowing with the poet's fire, pur&s;uing his way to &s;ome overhanging height.

The travellers, pa&s;&s;ing Novale&s;a, reached, after the evening had clo&s;ed, the &s;mall and ancient town of Su&s;a, which had for|merly guarded this pa&s;s of the Alps into Piedmont. The heights which command it had, &s;ince the invention of artillery, rendered its fortifications u&s;ele&s;s; but the&s;e romantic heights, &s;een by moonlight, with the town below, &s;urrounded by its walls and watch-towers, and partially illumined, exhibited an intere&s;ting picture to Emily. Here they re&s;ted for the night at an inn, which had little accommodation to boa&s;t of; but the travellers brought with them the hunger that gives delicious fla|vour to the coar&s;e&s;t viands, and the wearine&s;s that en&s;ures repo&s;e; and here Emily fir&s;t caught a &s;train of Italian mu&s;ic, on Italian ground. As &s;he &s;at after &s;upper at a little window, that opened upon the country, ob&s;erving an effect of the moonlight on the broken &s;urface of the mountains, and remembering that on &s;uch a night as this &s;he once had &s;at with her father and Valancourt, re&s;ting upon a cliff of the Pyrenees, &s;he heard from below the long-drawn notes of a violin, of &s;uch tone and delicacy of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, as harmonized exactly with the tender emotions &s;he was indulging, and both charmed and &s;urpri&s;ed her. Cavigni, who approached the window, &s;miled at her &s;urpri&s;e. "This is nothing extraordinary," &s;aid he, "you will hear the &s;ame, per|haps, at every inn in our way. It is one of our landlord's fam|ily who plays, I doubt not." Emily, as &s;he li&s;tened, thought he could be &s;carcely le&s;s than a profe&s;&s;or of mu&s;ic whom &s;he heard; and the &s;weet and plaintive &s;trains &s;oon lulled her into a reverie, from which &s;he was very unwillingly rou&s;ed by the raillery of Cavigni, and by the voice of Montoni, who gave or|ders to a &s;ervant to have the carriages ready at an early hour on the following morning; and added, that he meant to dine at Turin.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was exceedingly rejoiced to be once more on level ground; and, after giving a long detail of the various terrors &s;he had &s;uffered, which &s;he forgot that &s;he was de&s;crib|ing to the companions of her dangers, &s;he added a hope, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be beyond the view of the&s;e horrid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> "which all the world," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;hould not tempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cro&s;s again."

"He is going to the

<P>When &s;he was alone, unable to &s;leep, the land&s;capes of her native home, with Valancourt, and the circum&s;tances of her de|parture, haunted her fancy; &s;he drew pictures of &s;ocial happi|ne&s;s amid&s;t the grand &s;implicity of nature, &s;uch as &s;he feared &s;he had bade farewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for ever; and then, the idea of this young Piedmonte&s;e, thus ignorantly &s;porting with his happine&s;s, returned to her thoughts, and, glad to e&s;cape awhile from the pre&s;&s;ure of nearer intere&s;ts &s;he indulged her fancy in compo&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he following lines.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EARLY on the following morning the travellers &s;et out for Turin. The luxuriant plain, that extends from the feet of the Alps to that magnificent city, was not then, as now, &s;haded by an avenue of trees nine miles in length; but plantations of olives, mulberry and palms, fe&s;tooned with vines, mingled with the pa&s;toral &s;cenery, through which the rapid Po, after its de&s;cent from the mountains, wandered to meet the humble Doria at Turin. As they advanced towards this city, the Alps, &s;een at &s;ome di&s;tance began to appear in all their awful &s;ublimity; chain ri&s;ing over chain in long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, their higher points darken|ed by the hovering clouds, &s;ometimes hid, and at others &s;een &s;hooting up far above them; while their lower &s;teeps, broken in|to fanta&s;tic forms, were touched with blue and purpli&s;h tints, which, as they changed in light and &s;hade, &s;eemed to open new &s;cenes to the eye. To the ea&s;t &s;tretched the plains of Lombardy, with the towers of Turin ri&s;ing at a di&s;tance; and beyond the Apennines, bounding the horizon.</P>
<P>The general magnificence of that city, with its vi&s;tas of chur|ches and palaces, branching from the grand &s;quare, each opening to a land&s;cape of the di&s;tant Alps or Appennines, was not only &s;uch as Emily had never &s;een in France, but &s;uch as &s;he had never imagined.</P>
<P>Montoni, who had been often at Turin, and cared little about views of any kind, did not comply with his wife's reque&s;t, that they might &s;urvey &s;ome of &s;he palaces; but &s;taying only till the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments could be obtained, they &s;et

forward for Venice with all po&s;&s;ible rapidity. Montoni's man|ner, during this journey, was grave, and even haughty; and to|wards Madame Montoni he was more e&s;pecially re&s;erved; but it was not the re&s;erve of re&s;pect &s;o much as of pride and di&s;con|tent. Of Emily he took little notice. With Cavigni his con|ver&s;ations were commonly on political or military topics, &s;uch as the convul&s;ed &s;tate of their country rendered at this time par|ticularly intere&s;ting. Emily ob&s;erved, that, at the mention of any daring exploit, Montoni's eyes lo&s;t their &s;ullenne&s;s, and &s;eemed in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to gleam with fire; yet they &s;till retain|ed &s;omewhat of a lurking cunning, and &s;he &s;ometimes thought that their fire partook more of the glare of malice than the bright|ne&s;s of valour, though the latter would well have harmonized with the high chivalric air of his figure, in which Cavigni, with all his gay and gallant manners, was his inferior.</P>
<P>On entering the Milane&s;e, the gentlemen exchanged their French hats for the Italian cap of &s;carlet cloth, embroidered; and Emily was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that Montoni ad|ded to his the military ploom, while Cavigni retained only the feather: which was u&s;ually worn with &s;uch caps: but &s;he at length concluded, that Montoni a&s;&s;umed this en&s;ign of a &s;oldier for convenience, as a means of pa&s;&s;ing with more &s;afety through a country, over-run with parties of the military.</P>
<P>Over the beautiful plains of this country the deva&s;tations of war were frequently vi&s;ible. Where the lands had not been &s;uf|fered to lie uncultivated, they were often tracted with the &s;teps of the &s;poiler, the vines were torn down from the branches that had &s;upported them, the olives trampled upon the ground, and even the groves of mulberry trees had been hewn by the enemy to light fires that de&s;troyed the hamlets and villages of their owners. Emily turned her eyes with a &s;igh from the&s;e painful villages of contention to the Alps of the Gri&s;on, that overlooked them to the north, who&s;e awful &s;olitudes &s;eemed to offer to per|&s;ecuted man a &s;ecure a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>The travellers frequently di&s;tingui&s;hed troops of &s;oldiers mov|ing at a di&s;tance; and they experienced, at the little inns on the road, the &s;carcity of provi&s;ion and other inconveniences, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a part of the con&s;equence of inte&s;tine war; but they had never rea&s;on to be much alarmed for their immediate &s;afety, and they pa&s;&s;ed on to Milan with little interruption of any kind, where they &s;taid not to &s;urvey the grandeur of the city, or even to view its va&s;t cathedral, which was then building.</P>
<P>Beyond Milan, the country wore the a&s;pect of a ruder deva&s;|tation; and though every thing &s;eemed now quiet, the repo&s;e
<PB N="176" REF="029378_0089_0FE08019805DB448">
was like that of death, &s;pread over features, which retain the impre&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>It was not till they had pa&s;&s;ed the ea&s;tern limits of the Mala|ne&s;e, that the travellers &s;aw any troops &s;ince they had left Mi|lan, when, as the evening was drawing to a clo&s;e, they de&s;cried what appeared to be an army winding onward along the di&s;tant plains, who&s;e &s;pears and other arms caught the la&s;t rays of the &s;un. As the column advanced through a part of the road, contracted between two hillocks, &s;ome of the commanders on hor&s;eback were di&s;tingui&s;hed on a &s;mall eminence, pointing and making &s;ignals for the march; while &s;everal of the officers were riding along the line directing its progre&s;s, according to the &s;igns com|municated by tho&s;e above; and others, &s;eparating from the van|guard, which had emerged from the pa&s;s, were riding carele&s;sly along the plains, at &s;ome di&s;tance to the right of the army.</P>
<P>As they drew nearer, Montoni, di&s;tingui&s;hing the feathers that waved in their caps, and the banners, and liveries of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that followed them, thought he knew this to be the &s;mall army commanded by the famous captain Utaldo, with whom, as well as with &s;ome of the other chiefs, he was per&s;onally acquainted. He, therefore, gave orders that the carriages &s;hould draw up by the &s;ide of the road, to await their arrival, and give them the pa&s;s. A faint &s;train of martial mu&s;ic now &s;tole by, and, gradual|ly &s;trengthening as the troops approached, Emily di&s;tingui&s;hed the drums and trumpets, with the cla&s;h of cymbals and of arms, that were &s;truck by a &s;mall party, in time to the march.</P>
<P>Montoni being now certain that the&s;e were the bands of the victorious Utaldo, leaned from the carriage window, and hailed their general by waving his cap in the air; which compliment the chief returned by rai&s;ing his &s;pear, and then letting it down again &s;uddenly, which &s;ome of his officers, who were riding at a di&s;tance from the troops, came up to the carriage, and &s;aluted Montoni as an old acquaintance. The captain him&s;elf &s;oon after arriving, his bands halted while he conver&s;ed with Montoni, whom he appeared much rejoiced to &s;ee; and from what he &s;aid, Emi|ly under&s;tood that this was a victorious army, returning into their own principality; while the numerous waggons, that ac|companied them, contained the rich &s;poils of the enemy, their own wounded &s;oldiers, and the pri&s;oners they had taken in bat|tle, who were to be ran&s;omed when the peace, then negociating between the neighbouring &s;tates, &s;hould be ratified. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the following day were to &s;eparate, and each, taking his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;poil, was to return with his own band to his ca&s;tle. This was
<PB N="177" REF="029378_0089_0FE08019805DB448">
therefore to be an evening of uncommon and general fe&s;tivity, in commemoration of the victory they had accompli&s;hed together, and of the farewel which the commanders were about to take of each other.</P>
<P>Emily, as the&s;e officers conver&s;ed with Montoni, ob&s;erved with admiration, tinctured with awe, their high martial air, min|gled with the haughtine&s;s of the noble&s;&s;e of tho&s;e days, and heightened by the gallantry of their dre&s;s, by the plumes tower|ing on their caps, the armorial coat, Per&s;ian &s;a&s;h, and ancient Spani&s;h cloak. Utaldo, telling Montoni that his army were go|ing to encamp for the night near a village at only a few miles di&s;tance, invited him to turn back and partake of their fe&s;tivity, a&s;&s;uring the ladies al&s;o, that they &s;hould be plea&s;antly accommo|dated; but Montoni excu&s;ed him&s;elf, adding, that it was his de|&s;ign to reach Verona that evening; and, after &s;ome conver&s;ation concerning the &s;tate of the country towards that city, they parted.</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded without any interruption; but it was &s;ome hours after &s;un&s;et before they arrived at Verona, who&s;e beautiful environs were therefore not &s;een by Emily till the following morning; when, leaving that plea&s;ant town at an early hour, they &s;et off for Padua, where they embarked on the Brenta for Venice. Here the &s;cene was entirely changed; no ve&s;tiges of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;uch as had deformed the plains of the Milane&s;e, appeared; on the contrary, all was peace and elegance. The verdant banks of the Brenta exhibited a continued land&s;cape of beauty, gaiety, and &s;plendour. Emily gazed with admiration on the villas of the Venetian noble&s;&s;e, with their cool porticos and colonnades, overhung with poplars and cypre&s;&s;es of maje&s;tic height and lively verdure; on their rich orangeries, who&s;e blo&s;&s;oms perfumed the air, and on the luxuriant willows, that dipped their light leaves in the wave, and &s;heltered from the &s;un the gay parties who&s;e mu&s;ic came at intervals on the breeze. The Carnival did, in|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, appear to extend from Venice along the whole line of the&s;e enchanting &s;hores; the river was gay with boats pa&s;&s;ing to that city, exhibiting the fanta&s;tic diver&s;ity of a ma&s;querade in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the people within them; and, towards evening, groups of dancers frequently were &s;een beneath the trees.</P>
<P>Cavigni, meanwhile, informed her of the names of the noble|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> to whom the &s;everal villas they pa&s;&s;ed belonged, adding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ketches of their characters, &s;uch as &s;erved to amu&s;e rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to inform, exhibiting his own wit in&s;tead of the delineation of truth. Emily was &s;ometimes diver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by his conver&s;ation; but his gaiety did not entertain Madame Montoni, as it had for|merly
<PB N="178" REF="029378_0090_0FE0696956229C58">
done; &s;he was frequently grave, and Montoni retained his u&s;ual re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed Emily's admiration, on her fir&s;t view of Venice, with its i&s;lets, palaces, and towers ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea, who&s;e clear &s;urface reflected the tremulous picture in all its colours. The &s;un, &s;inking in the we&s;t, tinted the waves and the lofty mountains of Friuli, which &s;kirt the northern &s;hores of the Adriatic, with a &s;affron glow, while on the marble porticos and colonnades of St. Mark were thrown the rich lights and &s;hades of evening. As they glided on, the grander features of this city appeared more di&s;tinctly: its terraces, crowned with airy yet maje&s;tic fabrics, touched, as they now were, with the &s;plendour of the &s;etting &s;un, appeared as if they had been called up from the ocean by the wand of an enchanter, rather than reared by mortal hands.</P>
<P>The &s;un, &s;oon after, &s;inking to the lower world, the &s;had<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the earth &s;tole gradually over the waves, and then up the tow|ering &s;ides of the mountains of Friuli, till it extingui&s;hed even the la&s;t upward beams that had lingered on their &s;ummits, and the melancholy purple of evening drew over them, like a thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> veil. How deep, how beautiful was the tranquillity that wrap|ped the &s;cene! All nature &s;eemed to repo&s;e; the fine&s;t emotions of the &s;oul were alone awake. Emily's eyes filled with tears of admiration and &s;ublime devotion, as &s;he rai&s;ed them over the &s;leeping world to the va&s;t heavens, and heard the notes of &s;olemn mu&s;ic, that &s;tole over the waters from a di&s;tance. She li&s;tened in &s;till rapture, and no per&s;on of the party broke the charm by an inquiry. The &s;ounds &s;eemed to grow on the air; for &s;o &s;moothly did the barge glide along, that its motion was not per|ceivable, and the fairy city appeared approaching to welcome the &s;trangers. They now di&s;tingui&s;hed a female voice, accom|panied by a few in&s;truments, &s;inging a &s;oft and mournful air; and its fine expre&s;&s;ion, as &s;ometimes it &s;eemed pleading with the impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s of love, and then langui&s;hing into the ca|dence of hopele&s;s grief, declared, that it flowed from no feigned &s;en&s;ibility. Ah! thought Emily, as &s;he &s;ighed and remembered Valancourt, tho&s;e &s;trains come from the heart!</P>
<P>She looked round, with anxious inquiry; the deep twilight, that had fallen over the &s;cene, admitted only imperfect images to the eye, but, at &s;ome di&s;tance on the &s;ea, &s;he thought &s;he perceiv|ed a gondola: a chorus of voices and in&s;truments now &s;welled on the air&mdash;&s;o &s;weet, &s;o &s;olemn! it &s;eemed like the hymn of an|gels de&s;cending through the &s;ilence of night! Now it died away,
<PB N="179" REF="029378_0090_0FE0696956229C58">
and fancy almo&s;t beheld the holy choir rea&s;cending towards hea|ven; then again it &s;welled with the breeze, trembled awhile, and again died into &s;ilence. It brought to Emily's recollection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lines of her late father, and &s;he repeated in a low voice,
<Q><L>&mdash;Oft I hear,</L>
<L>Upon the &s;ilence of the midnight air,</L>
<L>Cele&s;tial voices &s;well in holy chorus</L>
<L>That bears the &s;oul to heaven!</L></Q></P>
<P>The deep &s;tillne&s;s, that &s;ucceeded, was as expre&s;&s;ive as the &s;train that had ju&s;t cea&s;ed. It was uninterrupted for &s;everal minutes, till a general &s;igh &s;eemed to relea&s;e the company from their en|chantment. Emily, however, long indulged the plea&s;ing &s;adne&s;s, that had &s;tolen upon her &s;pirits; but the gay and bu&s;y &s;cene that appeared, as the barge approached St. Mark's Place, at length rou&s;ed her attention. The ri&s;ing moon, which threw a &s;hadowy light upon the terraces&punc; and illumined the porticos and magnifi|cent arcades that crown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> them, di&s;covered the various company, who&s;e light &s;teps, &s;oft guitars, and &s;ofter voices, echoed through the colonnades.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic they heard before now pa&s;&s;ed Montoni's barge, in one of the gondolas, of which &s;everal were &s;een &s;kimming along the moonlight &s;ea, full of gay parties, catching the cool breeze. Mo&s;t of the&s;e had mu&s;ic, made &s;weeter by the waves over which it floated, and by the mea&s;ured &s;ound of oars, as they da&s;hed the &s;parkling tide. Emily gazed, and li&s;tened, and thought her&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a fairy &s;cene; even Madame Montoni was plea&s;ed; Montoni congratulated him&s;elf on his return to Venice, which he called the fir&s;t city in the world, and Cavigni was more gay and ani|mated than ever.</P>
<P>The barge pa&s;&s;ed on to the grand canal, where Montoni's man&s;ion was &s;ituated. And here, other forms of beauty and of grandeur, &s;uch as her imagination had never painted, were un|folded to Emily in the palaces of San&s;ovino and Palladio, as &s;he glided along the waves. The air bore no &s;ounds, but tho&s;e of &s;weetne&s;s, echoing along each margin of the canal, and from gondolas on its &s;urface, while groups of ma&s;ks were &s;een dancing on the moonlight terraces, and &s;eemed almo&s;t to realize the ro|mance of fairy-land.</P>
<P>The barge &s;topped before the portico of a large hou&s;e, from whence a &s;ervant of Montoni cro&s;&s;ed the terrace, and immediate|ly the party di&s;embarked. From the portico they pa&s;&s;ed a no|ble hall to a &s;tairca&s;e of marble, which led to a &s;aloon, fitted up
<PB N="180" REF="029378_0091_0FE0802F8F25F9B8">
in a &s;tyle of magnificence that &s;urpri&s;ed Emily. The walls and ceiling were adorned with hi&s;torical and allegorical paintings in <HI>fre&s;co;</HI> &s;ilver tripods, depending from chains of the &s;ame metal, illumined the apartment, the floor of which was covered with Indian mats painted in a variety of colours and devices; the couches and drapery of the lattices were of pale green &s;ilk, em|broidered and fringed with green and gold. Balcony lattices opened upon the grand canal, whence ro&s;e a confu&s;ion of voices and of mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and the breeze that gave fre&s;hne&s;s to the apartment. Emily, con&s;idering the gloomy temper of Mon|toni, looked upon the &s;plendid furniture of his hou&s;e with &s;ur|pri&s;e, and remembered the report of his being a man of broken fortune with a&s;toni&s;hment. "Ah!" &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "if Va|lancourt could but &s;ee this man&s;ion, what peace would it give him! He would then be convinced that the report was groundle&s;s."</P>
<P>Madame Montoni &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ume the airs of a prince&s;s; but Montoni was re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;contented, and did not even ob|&s;erve the civility of bidding her welcome to her home.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival, he ordered his gondola, and, with Cav|igni, went out to mingle in the &s;cenes of the evening. Madame then became &s;erious and thoughtful. Emily who was charmed with every thing &s;he &s;aw, endeavoured to enliven her; but re|flection had not, with Madame Montoni, &s;ubdued caprice and ill humour, and her an&s;wers di&s;covered &s;o much of both, that Emily gave up the attempt of diverting her, and withdrew to a lattice, to amu&s;e her&s;elf with the &s;cene without, &s;o new and &s;o enchanting.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object that attracted her notice was a group of dan|cers on the terrace below, led by a guitar, and &s;ome other in|&s;truments. The girl, who &s;truck the guitar, and another, who flouri&s;hed a tomborine, pa&s;&s;ed on in a dancing &s;tep, and with a light grace and gaiety of heart, that would have &s;ubdued the godde&s;s of &s;pleen in her wor&s;t humour. After the&s;e came a group of fanta&s;tic figures, &s;ome dre&s;&s;ed as gondolieri, others as min&s;trels, while others &s;eemed to defy all de&s;cription. They &s;ung in parts, their voices accompanied by a few &s;oft in&s;truments. At a little di&s;tance from the portico they &s;topped, and Emily di&s;tingui&s;hed the ver&s;es of Ario&s;to. They &s;ung of the wars of the Moors again&s;t Charlemagne, and then of the woes of Orlando: afterwards the mea&s;ure changed, and the melancholy &s;weetne&s;s of Petrach &s;ucceeded. The magic of his grief was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all that Italian mu&s;ic and Italian expre&s;&s;ion, heightened by the en|chantments of Venetian moonlight, could give.</P>
<P>Emily, as &s;he li&s;tened, caught the pen&s;ive enthu&s;ia&s;m; her tears flowed &s;ilently, while her fancy bore her far away to France
<PB N="181" REF="029378_0091_0FE0802F8F25F9B8">
and to Valancourt. Each &s;ucceeding &s;onnet, more full of charm|ing &s;adne&s;s than the la&s;t, &s;eemed to bind the &s;pell of melancho|ly: with extreme regret &s;he &s;aw the mu&s;icians move on, and her attention followed the &s;train till the la&s;t faint warble died in air. She then remained &s;unk in that pen&s;ive tranquillity which &s;oft mu&s;ic leaves on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mind&mdash;a &s;tate like that produced by the view of a beautiful land&s;cape by moonlight, or by the recollection of &s;cenes marked with the tenderne&s;s of friends lo&s;t for ever, and with &s;orrows, which time has mellowed into mild regret. Such &s;cenes are indeed, to the mind, like "tho&s;e faint traces which the memory bears of mu&s;ic that is pa&s;t."</P>
<P>Other &s;ounds &s;oon awakened her attention: it was the &s;o|lemn harmony of horns, that &s;welled from a di&s;tance; and, ob|&s;erving the gondolas arrange them&s;elves along the margin of the terraces, &s;he threw on her veil, and &s;tepping into the balcony, di&s;cerned in the di&s;tant per&s;pective of the canal, &s;omething like a proce&s;&s;ion, floating on the light &s;urface of the water: as it ap|proached, the horns and other in&s;truments mingled &s;weetly, and &s;oon after the fabled deities of the city &s;eemed to have ari&s;en from the ocean; for Neptune, with Venus per&s;onified as his queen, came on the undulating waves, &s;urrounded by tritons and &s;ea-nymphs. The fanta&s;tic &s;plendour of this &s;pectacle, together with the grandeur of the &s;urrounding palaces, appeared like the vi&s;ion of a poet &s;uddenly embodied, and the fanciful images which it awakened in Emily's mind, lingered there long after the proce&s;&s;ion had pa&s;&s;ed away. She indulged her&s;elf in im|agining what might be the manners and delights of a &s;ea-nymph, till &s;he almo&s;t wi&s;hed to throw off the habit of mortality, and plunge into the green wave to participate them.</P>
<P>"How delightful," &s;aid &s;he, "to live amid&s;t the coral bowers and cry&s;tal caverns of the ocean, with my &s;i&s;ter nymphs, and li&s;ten to the &s;ounding waters above, and to the &s;oft &s;hells of the tritons! and then, after &s;un&s;et, to &s;kim on the &s;urface of the waves round wild rocks and along &s;eque&s;tered &s;hores, where, perhaps, &s;ome pen&s;ive wanderer comes to weep! Then would I &s;ooth his &s;orrows with my &s;weet mu&s;ic, and offer him from a &s;hell &s;ome of the delicious fruit that hangs round Neptune's palace."</P>
<P>She was recalled from her reverie to a mere mortal &s;upper, and could not forbear &s;miling at the fancies &s;he had been indulg|ing, and at her conviction of the &s;erious di&s;plea&s;ure, which Madame Montoni would have expre&s;&s;ed, could &s;he have been made acquainted with them.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="029378_0092_0FE0803C8F492D70">
After &s;upper, her aunt &s;at late, but Montoni did not return, and &s;he at length retired to re&s;t. If Emily had admired the magnificence of the &s;aloon, &s;he was not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed, on ob&s;erv|ing the half furni&s;hed and, forlorn appearance of the apartments &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in the way to her chamber, whither &s;he went through long &s;uites of noble rooms, that &s;eemed, from their de&s;olate a&s;|pect, to have been unoccupied for many years. On the walls of &s;ome were the faded remains of tape&s;try; from others, painted in <HI>fre&s;co,</HI> the damps had almo&s;t withdrawn both colours and de&s;ign. At length &s;he reached her own chamber, &s;pacious, de&s;olate and lofty, like the re&s;t, with high lattices that opened towards the Adriatic. It brought gloomy images to her mind, but the view of the Adriatic &s;oon gave her others more airy, among which was that of the &s;ea-nymph, who&s;e delights &s;he had before amu&s;ed her&s;elf with picturing; and, anxious to e&s;cape from &s;erious re|flections, &s;he now endeavoured to throw her fanciful ideas into a train, and concluded the hour with compo&s;ing the following lines:</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MONTONI and his companion did not return home, till many hours after the dawn had blu&s;hed upon the Adriatic.&mdash;The airy groups, which had danced all night along the colon|nade of St. Mark, di&s;per&s;ed before the morning, like &s;o many &s;pirits. Monto I had been otherwi&s;e engaged; his &s;oul was little &s;u&s;ceptible of light plea&s;ures. He delighted in the ener|gies of the pa&s;&s;ions; the difficulties and tempe&s;ts of life, which wreck the happine&s;s of others, rou&s;ed and &s;trengthened all the powers of his mind, and afforded him the highe&s;t enjoyments, of which his nature was capable. Without &s;ome object of &s;trong in|tere&s;t, life was to him little more than a &s;leep; and, when pur|&s;uits of real intere&s;t failed, he &s;ub&s;tituted artificial ones, till habit changed their nature, and they cea&s;ed to be unreal. Of this kind was the habit of gaming, which he had adopted, fir&s;t, for the purpo&s;e of relieving him from the languor of inaction, but had &s;ince pur&s;ued with the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion. In this occupation he had pa&s;&s;ed the night with Cavigni and a party of young men, who had more money than rank, and more vice than either.&mdash;Montoni de&s;pi&s;ed the greater part of the&s;e for the inferiority of their talents, rather than from their vicious inclinations, and a&s;&s;o|ciated with them only to make them the in&s;truments of his pur|po&s;es. Among the&s;e, however, were &s;ome of &s;uperior abilities, and a few whom Montoni admitted to his intimacy, but even towards the&s;e he &s;till pre&s;erved a deci&s;ive and haughty air, which, while it impo&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on weak and timid minds, rou&s;ed the fierce hatred of &s;trong ones. He had, of cour&s;e, ma|ny and bitter enemies; but the rancour of their hatred proved the degree of his power; and, as power was his chief aim, he gloried more in &s;uch hatred, than it was po&s;&s;ible he could in be|ing e&s;teemed. A feeling &s;o tempered as that of e&s;teem, he de&s;|pi&s;ed,
<PB N="186" REF="029378_0094_0FE080492BD413D8">
and would have de&s;pi&s;ed him&s;elf al&s;o had he thought him|&s;elf capable of being flattered by it.</P>
<P>Among the few whom he di&s;tingui&s;hed, were the Signors Bertolini, Or&s;ino, and Verezzi. The fir&s;t was a man of a gay temper, &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, di&s;&s;ipated, and of unbounded extrava|gance, but generous, brave, and un&s;u&s;picious. Or&s;ino was re|&s;erved, and haughty; loving power more then o&s;tentation; of a cruel and &s;u&s;picious temper; quick to feel an injury, and re|lentle&s;s in avenging it; cunning and un&s;earchable in contrivance, patient and indefatigable in the execution of his &s;chemes. He had a perfect command of feature and of his pa&s;&s;ions, of which he had &s;carcely any, but pride, revenge and avarice; and, in the gratification of the&s;e, few con&s;iderations had power to re&s;train him, few ob&s;tacles to with&s;tand the depth of his &s;tratagems. This man was the chief favourite of Montoni, Verezzi was a man of &s;ome talent, of fiery imagination, and the &s;lave of alternate pa&s;&s;ions. He was gay, voluptuous, and daring; yet had neither per&s;everance or true courage, and was meanly &s;elfi&s;h in all his aims. Quick to form &s;chemes, and &s;anguine in his hope of &s;uc|ce&s;s, he was the fir&s;t to undertake, and to abandon, not only his own plans, but tho&s;e adopted from other per&s;ons. Proud and impetuous, he revolted again&s;t all &s;ubordination, yet tho&s;e who were acquainted with his character, and watched the turn of his pa&s;&s;ions, could lead him like a child.</P>
<P>Such were the friends whom Montoni introduced to his fami|ly and his table on the day after his arrival at Venice. There were al&s;o of the party a Venetian nobleman, Count Morano, and a Signora Livona, whom Montoni had introduced to his wife, as a lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and who, having called in the morning to welcome her to Venice, had been reque&s;ted to be of the dinner party.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni received, with a very ill grace, the compli|ments of the Signors. She di&s;liked them, becau&s;e they were the friends of her hu&s;band; hated them becau&s;e &s;he believed they had contributed to detain him abroad till &s;o late an hour of the preceding morning; and envied them, &s;ince con&s;cious of her own want of influence, &s;he was convinced, that he preferred their &s;ociety to her own. The rank of Count Morano procured him that di&s;tinction which &s;he refu&s;ed to the re&s;t of the compa|ny. The haughty &s;ullenne&s;s of her countenance and manner, and the o&s;tentatious extravagance of her dre&s;s, for &s;he had not yet adopted the Venetian habit, were &s;trikingly contra&s;ted by the beauty, mode&s;ty, &s;weetne&s;s and &s;implicity of Emily, who ob|&s;erved,
<PB N="187" REF="029378_0094_0FE080492BD413D8">
with more attention than plea&s;ure, the party around her. The beauty and fa&s;cinating manners of Signora Livona, how|ever, won her involuntary regard; while the &s;weetne&s;s of her ac|cents and her air of gentle kindne&s;s awakened with Emily tho&s;e plea&s;ing affections, which &s;o long had &s;lumbered.</P>
<P>In the cool of the evening the party embarked in Montoni's gondola, and rowed out upon the &s;ea, The red glow of &s;un&s;et &s;till touch'd the waves, and lingered in the we&s;t, where the melan|choly gleam &s;eemed &s;lowly expiring, while the dark blue of the upper aether began to twinkle with &s;tars. Emily &s;at, given up to pen&s;ive and &s;weet emotions. The &s;moothne&s;s of the water ever which &s;he glided, its reflected images&mdash;a new heaven and trembling &s;tars below the waves, with &s;hadowy outlines of tow|ers and porticos, con&s;pired with the &s;tillne&s;s of the hour, inter|rupted only by the pa&s;&s;ing wave, or the notes of di&s;tant mu&s;ic, to rai&s;e tho&s;e emotions to enthu&s;ia&s;m. As &s;he li&s;tened to the mea&s;ured &s;ound of the oars, and to the remote warblings that came in the breeze, her &s;oftened mind returned to the memory of St. Aubert and to Valancourt, and tears &s;tole to her eyes. The rays of the moon, &s;trengthening, as the &s;hadows deepened, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> after threw a &s;ilvery gleam upon her countenance, which was partly &s;haded by a thin black veil, and touched it with inimit|able &s;oftne&s;s. Hers was the <HI>contour</HI> of a Madona, with the &s;en|&s;ibility of a Magdalen; and the pen&s;ive uplifted eye with the tear that glittered on her cheek confirmed the expre&s;&s;ion of the character.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;train of di&s;tant mu&s;ic now died in air, for the gon|dola was far upon the waves, and the party determined to have mu&s;ic of their own. The Count Morano, who &s;at next to Emi|ly, and who had been ob&s;erving her for &s;ometime in &s;ilence, &s;natched up a lute, and &s;truck the chords with the finger of har|mony, her&s;elf, while his voice, a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e tenor, accompanied them in a rondeau full of tender &s;adne&s;s. To him, indeed, might have been applied that beautiful exhortion of an Engli&s;h poet, had it then exi&s;ted:
<Q><L>&mdash;"Strike up, my ma&s;ter,</L>
<L>But touch the &s;trings with a religious &s;oftne&s;s!</L>

<P>With &s;uch powers of expre&s;&s;ion the Count &s;ung the fol|lowing.</P>

<P>The cadence with which he returned from the la&s;t &s;tanza to a repetition of the fir&s;t; the fine modulation in which his voice &s;tole upon the fir&s;t line, and the pathetic energy with which it pronounced the la&s;t, were &s;uch as only exqui&s;ite ta&s;te could give. When he had concluded, he gave the lute with a &s;igh to Emily, who, to avoid any appearance of affectation, immediately began to play. She &s;ung a melancholy little air, one of the popular &s;ongs of her native province, with a &s;implicity and pathos that made it enchanting. But its well-known melody brought &s;o forcibly to her fancy the &s;cenes and the per&s;ons, among which &s;he had often heard it, that her &s;pirits were overcome, her voice trembled and cea&s;ed&mdash;and the &s;trings of the lute were &s;truck with a di&s;ordered hand; till, a&s;hamed of the emotion &s;he had betrayed, &s;he &s;uddenly pa&s;&s;ed on to a &s;ong &s;o gay and airy, that the &s;teps of the dance &s;eemed almo&s;t to echo to the notes. <HI>Bra|vi&s;&s;imo!</HI> bur&s;t in&s;tantly from the lips of her delighted auditors, and &s;he was compelled to repeat the air. Among the compli|ments that followed, tho&s;e of the Count were not the lea&s;t audi|ble, and they had not concluded, when Emily gave the in&s;tru|ment to Signora Livona, who&s;e voice accompanied it with true Italian ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Count, Emily, Cavigni, and the Signora, &s;ung <HI>canzone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tes,</HI> accompanied by a couple of lutes and a few other in|&s;truments.
<PB N="189" REF="029378_0095_0FE0804ED688D838">
Sometimes the in&s;truments &s;uddenly cea&s;ed, and the voices dropped from the full &s;well of harmony into a low chant; then, after a deep pau&s;e, they ro&s;e by degrees, the in&s;truments one by one &s;triking up, till the loud and full chorus &s;oared again to heaven!</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Montoni, who was weary of this harmony, was con&s;idering how he might di&s;engage him&s;elf from his party, or withdraw with &s;uch of it as would be willing to play, to a Ca|&s;ino. In a pau&s;e of the mu&s;ic, he propo&s;ed returning to &s;hore, a propo&s;al which Or&s;ino eagerly &s;econded, but which the Count and the other gentlemen as warmly oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Montoni &s;till meditated how he might excu&s;e him&s;elf from longer attendance upon the Count, for to him only he thought excu&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, and how he might get to land, till the gondo|lieri of an empty boat, returning to Venice, hailed his people. Without troubling him&s;elf longer about an excu&s;e, he &s;eized this opportunity of going thither, and, committing the ladies to the care of his friends, departed with Or&s;ino, while Emily, for the fir&s;t time &s;aw him go with regret; for &s;he con&s;idered his pre|&s;ence a protection, though &s;he knew not what &s;he &s;hould fear. He landed at St. Mark's, and, hurrying to a Ca&s;ino, was &s;oon lo&s;t amid&s;t a crowd of game&s;ters.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Count having &s;ecretly di&s;patched a &s;ervant in Montoni's boat, for his own gondola and mu&s;icians, Emily, heard without knowing his project, the gay &s;ong of gondolieri approach|ing, as they &s;at on the &s;tern of the boat, and &s;aw the tremulous gleam of the moonlight wave, which their oars di&s;turbed. Pre&s;ently &s;he heard the &s;ound of in&s;truments, and then a full &s;ym|phony &s;welled on the air, and, the boats meeting, the gondolieri hailed each other. The Count then explaining him&s;elf, the party removed into his gondola, which was embelli&s;hed with all that ta&s;te could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>While they partook of a collation of fruits and ice, the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">end, following at a di&s;tance, in the other boat, played the mo&s;t &s;weet and enchanting &s;trains, and the Count, who had again &s;eat|ed him&s;elf by Emily, paid her unremitted attention, and &s;ome|times in a low but impa&s;&s;ioned voice, uttered compliments which &s;he could not mi&s;under&s;tand. To avoid them &s;he conver&s;ed with Signora Livona, and her manner to the Count a&s;&s;umed a mild re&s;erve, which, though dignified, was too gentle to repre&s;s his a&s;&s;iduities: he could &s;ee, hear, &s;peak to no per&s;on, but Emily, while Cavigni ob&s;erved him now and then, with a look of di&s;|plea&s;ure, and Emily, with one of unea&s;ine&s;s. She now wi&s;hed
<PB N="190" REF="029378_0096_0FE0805B53D83728">
for nothing &s;o much as to return to Venice, but it was near mid|night before the gondolas approached St. Mark's Place, where the voice of gaiety and &s;ong was loud. The bu&s;y hum of ming|ling &s;ounds was heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance on the water, and, had not a bright moonlight di&s;covered the city, with its terraces and towers, a &s;tranger would almo&s;t have credited the fabled wonders of Neptune's court, and believed, that the tumult aro&s;e from beneath the waves.</P>
<P>They landed at St. Mark's, where the gaiety of the colonnades and the beauty of the night, made Madame Montoni willingly &s;ubmit to the Count's &s;olicitations to join the promenade, and afterwards to take a &s;upper with the re&s;t of the party, at his Ca|&s;ino. If any thing could have di&s;&s;ipated Emily's unea&s;ine&s;s, it would have been the grandeur, gaiety, and novelty of the &s;ur|rounding &s;cene, adorned with Palladio's palaces, and bu&s;y with parties of ma&s;queraders.</P>
<P>At length they withdrew to the Ca&s;ino, which was fitted up with infinite ta&s;te, and where a &s;plendid banquet was prepared; but here Emily's re&s;erve made the Count perceive, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for his intere&s;t to win the favour of Madame Montoni, which, from the conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;he had already &s;hewn to him, ap|peared to be an achievement of no great difficulty. He transfer|red, therefore, part of his attention from Emily to her aunt, who felt too much flattered by the di&s;tinction even to di&s;gui&s;e her emotion; and, before the party broke up, he had intirely engaged the e&s;teem of Madame Montoni. Whenever he addre&s;&s;ed her, her ungracious countenance relaxed into &s;miles, and to whatever h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> propo&s;ed &s;he a&s;&s;ented. He invited her, with the re&s;t of the party, to take coffee, in his box at the opera, on the following evening, and Emily heard the invitation accepted, with &s;trong anxiety, concerning the means of excu&s;ing her&s;elf from attending Madame Montoni thither.</P>
<P>It was very late before their gondola was ordered, and Emily's &s;urpri&s;e was extreme, when on quitting the Ca&s;ino, &s;he beheld the broad &s;un ri&s;ing out of the Adriatic, while St. Mark's Place was yet crowded with company. Sleep had long weighed heavily on her eyes, but now the fre&s;h &s;ea breeze revived her, and &s;he would have quitted the &s;cene with regret, had not the Count been pre&s;ent, performing the duty, which he had impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf, of e&s;corting them home. There they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ard that Mon|toni was not yet returned; and his wife, retiring in di&s;plea&s;ure to her apartment, at length relea&s;ed Emily from the fatigue of further attendance.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="029378_0096_0FE0805B53D83728">
Montoni came home late in the morning, in a very ill humour, having lo&s;t con&s;iderably at play, and, before he withdrew to re&s;t, had a private conference with Cavigni, who&s;e manner, on the following day, &s;eemed to tell, that the &s;ubject of it had not been plea&s;ing to him.</P>
<P>In the evening, Madame Montoni, who, during the day, had ob&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence towards her hu&s;band, received vi&s;its from &s;ome Venetian ladies, with who&s;e &s;weet manners Emily was particularly charmed. They had an air of ea&s;e and kind|ne&s;s towards the &s;trangers, as if they had been their familiar friends for years; and their conver&s;ation was by turns tender, &s;entimental and gay. Madame, though &s;he had no ta&s;te for &s;uch conver&s;ation, and who&s;e coar&s;ene&s;s and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s &s;ometimes ex|hibited a ludicrous contra&s;t to their exce&s;&s;ive refinement, could not remain wholly in&s;en&s;ible to the captivations of their manner.</P>
<P>In a pau&s;e of conver&s;ation, a lady who was called Signora Herminia took up a lute, and began to play and &s;ing, with as much ea&s;y gaiety, as if &s;he had been alone. Her voice was un|commonly rich in tone, and various in expre&s;&s;ion; yet &s;he ap|peared to be entirely uncon&s;cious of its powers, and meant noth|ing le&s;s than to di&s;play them. She &s;ung from the gaiety of her heart, as &s;he &s;at with her veil half thrown back, holding grace|fully the lute, under the &s;preading foliage and flowers of &s;ome plants that ro&s;e from ba&s;kets, and interlaced one of the lattices of the &s;aloon. Emily, retiring a little from the company, &s;ketch|ed her figure, with the miniature &s;cenery around her, and drew a very intere&s;ting picture, which, though it would not, perhaps have borne critici&s;m, had &s;pirit and ta&s;te enough to a waken both the fancy and the heart. When &s;he had fini&s;hed it, &s;he pre&s;ent|ed it to the beautiful original, who was delighted with the of|fering, as well as the &s;entiment it conveyed, and a&s;&s;ured Emily, with a &s;mile of captivating &s;weetne&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould pre&s;erve it, as a pledge of her friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the evening Cavigni joined the ladies, but Montoni had other engagements; and they embarked in the gondola for St. Mark's, were the &s;ame gay company &s;eemed to flutter as on the preceding night. The cool breeze, the gla&s;&s;y &s;ea, the gentle &s;ound of its waves, and the &s;weeter murmur of di&s;tant mu&s;ic; the lofty porticos and arcades, and the happy groups that &s;aun|tered beneath them; the&s;e, with every feature and circum&s;tance of the &s;cene, united to charm Emily, no longer tea&s;ed by the of|ficious attentions of Count Morano. But, as &s;he looked upon the moonlight &s;ea, undulating along the walls of St. Mark, and
<PB N="192" REF="029378_0097_0FE0805FEBEB4558">
lingering for a moment over tho&s;e walls, caught the &s;weet and melancholy &s;ong of &s;ome gondolier as he &s;at in his boat below, waiting for his ma&s;ter, her &s;oftened mind returned to the memo|ry of her home, of her friends and of all that was dear in her native country.</P>
<P>After walking &s;ometime, they &s;at down at the door of a Ca|&s;ino, and, while Cavigni was accommodating them with coffee and ice, were joined by Count Morano. He &s;ought Emily with a look of impatient delight, who, remembering all the at|tention he had &s;hewn her on the preceding evening, was com|pelled, as before, to &s;hrink from his a&s;&s;iduities into a timid re|&s;erve, except when &s;he conver&s;ed with Signora Herminia and the other ladies of her party.</P>
<P>It was near midnight before they withdrew to the opera, where Emily was not &s;o charmed but that, when &s;he remember|ed the &s;cene &s;he had ju&s;t quitted, &s;he felt how infinitely inferi|or all the &s;plendor of art is to the &s;ublimity of nature. Her heart was not now affected, tears of admiration did not &s;tart to her eyes, as when &s;he viewed the va&s;t expan&s;e of ocean, the gran|deur of the heavens, and li&s;tened to the rolling waters, and to the faint mu&s;ic that, at intervals, mingled with their roar. Re|membering the&s;e, the &s;cene before her faded into in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>Of the evening, which pa&s;&s;ed on without any particular inci|dent &s;he wi&s;hed the conclu&s;ion, that &s;he might e&s;cape from the attentions of the Count; and, as oppo&s;ite qualities frequently at|tract each other in our thoughts, thus Emily, when &s;he looked on Count Morano, remembered Valancourt, and a &s;igh &s;ometimes followed the recollection.</P>
<P>Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of cu&s;tomary vi&s;its, during which nothing remarkable occurred. Emily was amu&s;ed by the manners and &s;cenes that &s;urrounded her, &s;o different from tho&s;e of France, but where Count Morano, too frequently for her com|fort, contrived to introduce him&s;elf. His manner, figure and accompli&s;hments, which were generally admired, Emily would, perhaps, have admired al&s;o, had her heart been di&s;engaged from Valancourt, and had the Count <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e to per&s;ecute her with officious attentions, during which &s;he ob&s;erved &s;ome traits in his character, that prejudiced her again&s;t whatever might otherwi&s;e be good in it.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival at Venice, Montoni received a packet from M. Que&s;nel, in which the latter mentioned the death of his wife's uncle, at his villia on the Brenta; and that, in con&s;e|quence of this event, he &s;hould ha&s;ten to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
<PB N="193" REF="029378_0097_0FE0805FEBEB4558">
e&s;tate and of other effects bequeathed to him. This uncle was the brother of Madame Que&s;nel's late mother; Montoni was related to her by the father's &s;ide, and though he could have had neither claim nor expectation concerning the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he could &s;carcely conceal the envy which M. Que&s;nel's letter excited.</P>
<P>Emily had ob&s;erved with concern, that, &s;ince they left France, Montoni had not even affected kindne&s;s towards her aunt, and that, after treating her, at fir&s;t with neglect, he now met her with uniform ill humour and re&s;erve. She had never &s;uppo&s;ed, that her aunt's foibles could have e&s;caped the di&s;cernment of Monto|ni, or that her mind or figure were of a kind to de&s;erve his at|tention. Her &s;urpri&s;e, therefore, at this match, had been ex|treme; but &s;ince he had made the choice, &s;he did not &s;u&s;pect that he would &s;o openly have di&s;covered his contempt of it. But Montoni, who had been allured by the &s;eeming wealth of Madame Cheron, was now &s;everely di&s;appointed by her com|parative poverty, and highly exa&s;perated by the deceit &s;he had employed to conceal it, till concealment, was no longer nece&s;&s;a|ry. He had been deceived in an affair, wherein he meant to be the deceiver; outwitted by the &s;uperior cunning of a woman, who&s;e under&s;tanding he de&s;pi&s;ed, and to whom he had &s;acrificed his pride and his liberty, without &s;aving him&s;elf from the ruin, which had impended over his head. Madame Montoni had contrived to have the greate&s;t part of what &s;he really did po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;ettled upon her&s;elf: what remained, though it was totally inade|quate both to her hu&s;band's expectations, and to his nece&s;&s;ities, he had converted into money, and brought with him to Venice, that he might a little longer delude &s;ociety, and make a la&s;t ef|fort to regain the fortunes he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The hints which had been thrown out to Valancourt, con|cerning Montoni's character and condition, were too true; but it was now left to time and occa&s;ion, to unfold the circum&s;tan|ces, both of what had, and what had not been hinted, and to time and occa&s;ion we commit them.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was not of a nature to bear injuries with meekne&s;s, or to re&s;ent them with dignity: her exa&s;perated pride di&s;played it&s;elf in all the violence and acrimony of a little, or at lea&s;t an ill-regulated mind. She would not acknowledge, even to her&s;elf, that &s;he had in any degree provoked contempt by her duplicity, but weakly per&s;i&s;ted in believing, that &s;he alone was to be pitied, and Montoni, alone to be cen&s;ured; for, as her mind had naturally little perception of moral obligation,
<PB N="194" REF="029378_0098_0FE0806CEC0729F8">
&s;he &s;eldom under&s;tood its force but when it happened to be vio|lated towards her&s;elf; her vanity had already been &s;everely &s;hocked by a di&s;covery of Montoni's contempt; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> remained to be farther reproved by a di&s;covery of his circum&s;tances. His man&s;ion at Venice, though its furniture di&s;covered a part of the truth to unprejudiced per&s;ons, told nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e who were blinded by a re&s;olution to believe whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wi&s;hed. Ma|dame Montoni &s;till thought her&s;elf little le&s;s than a prince&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a palace at Venice, and a ca&s;tle among the Apennines. To the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, indeed Montoni &s;ometimes talked of going for a few weeks to examine into its condition, and to re|ceive &s;ome rents; for it appeared that he had not been there for two years, and that, during this period it had been inhabited only by an old &s;ervant, whom he called his &s;teward.</P>
<P>Emily li&s;tened to the mention of this journey with plea&s;ure, for &s;he not only expected from it new ideas, but a relea&s;e from the per&s;evering a&s;&s;iduities of Count Morano. In the country, too &s;he would have lei&s;ure to think of Valancourt, and to indulge the melancholy, which his image, and a recollection of the &s;cenes of La Vallee, always ble&s;&s;ed with the memory of her parents, awakened. The ideal &s;cenes were dearer, and more &s;oothing to her heart, than all the &s;plendour of gay a&s;&s;emblies; they were a kind of tali&s;man that expelled the poi&s;on of temporary evils, and &s;upported her hopes of happy days: they appeared like a beautiful land&s;cape, lighted up by a gleam of &s;un&s;hine, and &s;een through a per&s;pective of dark and rugged rocks.</P>
<P>But Count Morano did not long confine him&s;elf to &s;ilent a&s;&s;i|duities; he declared his pa&s;&s;ion to Emily, and made propo&s;als to Montoni, who encouraged though Emily rejected, him: with Mon|toni for his friend, and an abundance of vanity to delude him, he did not de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. Emily was a&s;toni&s;hed and highly di&s;gu&s;ted at his per&s;everance, after &s;he had explained her &s;enti|ments with a frankne&s;s that would not allow him to mi&s;under|&s;tand them.</P>
<P>He now pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of his time a Montoni's, din|ing there almo&s;t daily, and attending Madame and Emily where|ever they went; and all this, notwith&s;tanding the uniform re|&s;erve of Emily, who&s;e aunt &s;eemed as anxious an Montoni to pro|mote this marriage; and would never di&s;pen&s;e with her atten|dance at any a&s;&s;embly where the Count propo&s;ed to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Montoni now &s;aid nothing of his intended journey, of which Emily waited impatiently to hear; and he was &s;eldom at home but when the Count, or Signor Or&s;ino, was there, for, between
<PB N="195" REF="029378_0098_0FE0806CEC0729F8">
him&s;elf and Cavigni a coolne&s;s &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, though the latter remained in his hou&s;e. With Or&s;ino, Montoni was fre|quently clo&s;eted for hours together, and, whatever might be the bu&s;ine&s;s, upon which they con&s;ulted, it appeared to be of con&s;e|quence, &s;ince Montoni often &s;acrificed to it his favourite pa&s;&s;ion for play, and remained at home the whole night. There was &s;omewhat of privacy, too, in the manner of Or&s;ino's vi&s;its, which had never before occurred, and which excited not only &s;urpri&s;e, but &s;ome degree of alarm in Emily's mind, who had unwillingly di&s;covered much of his character when he had mo&s;t endeavoured to di&s;gui&s;e it. After the&s;e vi&s;its, Montoni was of|ten more thoughtful than u&s;ual; &s;ometimes the deep workings of his mind entirely ab&s;tracted him from &s;urrounding objects, and threw a gloom over his vi&s;age that rendered it terrible; at others, his eyes &s;eemed almo&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fire, and all the energies of his &s;oul appeared to be rou&s;ed for &s;ome great enterpri&s;e. Emily ob&s;erved the&s;e written characters of his thoughts with deep intere&s;t, and not without &s;ome degree of awe, when &s;he con&s;idered that &s;he was entirely in his power; but forbore even to hint her fears, or her ob&s;ervations, to Madame Montoni, who di&s;cerned nothing in her hu&s;band, at the&s;e times, but his u&s;ual &s;ternne&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;econd letter from M. Que&s;nel announced the arrival of him&s;elf and his lady at the villa Miar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nti; &s;tated &s;everal circum|&s;tances of his good fortune, re&s;pecting the affair that had brought him into Italy; and concluded with an earne&s;t reque&s;t to &s;ee Montoni, his wife and niece at his new e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Emily received about the &s;ame period, a much more intere&s;t|ing letter, and which &s;oothed for a while every anxiety of her heart. Valancourt hoping &s;he might be &s;till at Venice, had tru&s;ted a letter to the ordinary po&s;t, that told her of his health, and of his uncea&s;ing and anxious affection. He had lingered at Tholou&s;e for &s;ometime after her departure, that he might in|dulge the melanchoy plea&s;ure of wandering through the &s;cenes where he had been accu&s;tomed to behold her, and had thence gone to his brother's chateau, which was in the neighbourhood of La Vallee. Having mentioned this, he added, "If the duty of attending my regiment did not require my departure, I know not when I &s;hould have re&s;olution enough to quit the neighbour|hood of a place which is endeared by the remembrance of you. The vicinity to La Vallee has alone detained me thus long at E&s;tuviere: I frequently ride thither early in the morning, that I may wander, at lei&s;ure, through the day, among &s;cenes, which were once your home, where I have been accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="196" REF="029378_0099_0FE0807184BA4808">
&s;ee you, and to hear you conver&s;e. I have renewed my acquain|tance with the good old There&s;a, who rejoiced to &s;ee me, that &s;he might talk of you: I need not &s;ay how much this circum|&s;tance attached me to her, or how eagerly I li&s;tened to her upon her favourite &s;ubject. You will gue&s;s the motive that fir&s;t indu|ced me to make my&s;elf known to There&s;a: it was, indeed, no other than that of gaining admittance into the chateau and gar|dens, which my Emily had &s;o lately inhabited: here, then, I wander, and meet your image under every &s;hade: but chiefly I love to &s;it beneath the &s;preading branches of your favourite plane, where once, Emily, we &s;at together; where I fir&s;t ventur|ed to tell you, that I loved. O Emily! the remembrance of tho&s;e moments overcomes me, I &s;it lo&s;t in reverie, I endeavour to &s;ee you dimly through my tears, in all the heaven of peace and in|nocence, &s;uch as you then appeared to me; to hear again the ac|cents of that voice, which then thrilled my heart with tenderne&s;s and hope. I lean on the wall of the terrace, where we together watched the rapid current of the Garonne below, while I de|&s;cribed the wild &s;cenery about its &s;ource, but thought only of you. O Emily! are the&s;e moments pa&s;&s;ed for ever&mdash;will they never more return?"</P>
<P>In another part of his letter he wrote thus. "You &s;ee my letter is dated on many different days, and, if you look back to the fir&s;t, you will perceive that I began to write &s;oon after your departure from France. To write was, indeed, the only em|ployment that withdrew me from my own melancholy, and ren|dered your ab&s;ence &s;upportable, or rather, it &s;eemed to de&s;troy ab&s;ence; for, when I was conver&s;ing with you o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> paper, and telling you every &s;entiment and affection of my heart, you almo&s;t appeared to be pre&s;ent. This employment has been from time to time my chief con&s;olation, and I have deferred &s;ending off my packet, merely for the comfort of prolonging it, though it was certain, that what I had written, was written to no purpo&s;e till you received it. Whenever my mind has been more than u&s;ually depre&s;&s;ed I have come to pour forth its &s;orrows to you, and have always found con&s;olation; and, when any little occur|rence has intere&s;ted my heart, and given a gleam of joy to my &s;pirits, I have ha&s;tened to communicate it to you, and have re|ceived reflected &s;atisfaction. Thus, my letter is a kind of pic|ture of my life and of my thoughts for the la&s;t month, and thus, though it has been deeply intere&s;ting to me, while I wrote it, and I dare hope will, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, be not indifferent to you, yet to other readers it would &s;eem to abound only in frivol|ities.
<PB N="197" REF="029378_0099_0FE0807184BA4808">
Thus it is always, when we attempt to de&s;cribe the finer movements of the heart, for they are too fine to be di&s;cerned, they can only be experienced, and are therefore pa&s;&s;ed over by the indifferent ob&s;erver, while the intere&s;ted one feels, that all de&s;cription is imperfect and unnece&s;&s;ary, except as it may prove the &s;incerity of the writer, and &s;ooth his own &s;ufferings. You will pardon all this egoti&s;m&mdash;for I am a lover."</P>
<P>"I have ju&s;t heard of a circum&s;tance, which entirely de&s;troys all my fairy paradi&s;e of ideal delight, and which will recon|cile me to the nece&s;&s;ity of returning to my regiment, for I mu&s;t no longer wander beneath the beloved &s;hades, where I have been accu&s;tomed to meet you in thought. La Vallee is let! I have rea&s;on to believe this is without your knowledge, from what There&s;a told me this morning, and, therefore, I mention the cir|cum&s;tance. She &s;hed tears, while &s;he related, that &s;he was going to leave the &s;ervice of her dear mi&s;tre&s;s, and the chateau where &s;he had lived &s;o many happy years; and all this, added &s;he, without even a letter from Mademoi&s;elle to &s;often the news; but it is all M. Que&s;nel's doings, and I dare &s;ay &s;he does not even know what is going forward."</P>
<P>"There&s;a added, That &s;he had received a letter from him, informing her that the chateau was let, and that, as her &s;ervices would no longer be required, &s;he mu&s;t quit the place, on that day week, when the new tenant would arrive."</P>
<P>"There&s;a had been &s;urpri&s;ed by a vi&s;it from M. Que&s;nel, &s;ometime before the receipt of this letter, who was accompanied by a &s;tranger that viewed the premi&s;es with much curio&s;ity."</P>
<P>Towards the conclu&s;ion of his letter, which is dated a week after this &s;entence, Valancourt adds, "I have received a &s;um|mons from my regiment, and I join it without regret, &s;ince I am &s;hut out from the &s;cenes that are &s;o intere&s;ting to my heart. I rode to La Vallee this morning, and heard that the new tenant was arrived, and that There&s;a was gone. I &s;hould not treat the &s;ubject thus familiarly if I did not believe you to be uninformed of this di&s;po&s;al of your hou&s;e; for your &s;atisfaction I have en|deavoured to learn &s;omething of the charcter and fortune of your tenant, but without &s;ucce&s;s. He is a gentleman, they &s;ay, and this is all I can hear. The place, as I wandered round the boun|daries, appeared more melancholy to my imagaintion, than I had ever &s;een it. I wi&s;hed earne&s;tly to have got admittance, that I might have taken another leave of your favourite plane-tree, and thought of you once more beneath its &s;hade: but I forbore to tempt the curio&s;ity of &s;trangers: the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e in
<PB N="198" REF="029378_0100_0FE0807E05734F38">
the woods, however, was &s;till open to me; thither I went, and pa&s;&s;ed an hour, which I cannot even look back upon without emotion. O Emily! &s;urely we are not &s;eparated forever&mdash;&s;urely we &s;hall live for each other!"</P>
<P>This letter brought many tears to Emily's eyes; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ars of ten|derne&s;s and &s;atisfaction on learning that Valancourt was well, and that time and ab&s;ence had in no degree effaced her image from his heart. There were pa&s;&s;ages in this letter which par|ticularly affected her, &s;uch as tho&s;e de&s;cribing his vi&s;its to La Vallee, and the &s;entiments of delicate affection that its &s;cenes had awakened. It was a con&s;iderable time before her mind was &s;ufficiently ab&s;tracted from Valancourt to feel the force of his intelligence concerning La Vallee. That Mon&s;. Que&s;nel &s;hould let it, without even con&s;ulting her on the mea&s;ure, both &s;urpri|&s;ed and &s;hocked her, particularly as it proved the ab&s;olute au|thority he thought him&s;elf entitled to exerci&s;e in her affairs. It is true, he had propo&s;ed, before &s;he left France, that the chateau &s;hould be let, during her ab&s;ence, and to the oeconomical pru|dence of this &s;he had nothing to object; but the committing what had been her father's villa to the power and caprice of &s;trangers, and the depriving her&s;elf of a &s;ure home, &s;hould any unhappy circum&s;tances make her look back to her home as an a&s;ylum, were con&s;iderations that made her, even then, &s;trongly oppo&s;e the mea&s;ure. Her father, too, in his la&s;t hour, had re|ceived from her a &s;olemn promi&s;e never to di&s;po&s;e of La Vallee; and this &s;he con&s;idered as in &s;ome degree violated if &s;he &s;uffered the place to be let. But it was now evident with how little re&s;pect M. Que&s;nel had regarded the&s;e objections, and how in|&s;ignificant he con&s;idered every ob&s;tacle to pecuniary advantage. It appeared, al&s;o, that he had not even conde&s;cended to inform Montoni of the &s;tep he had taken, &s;ince no motive was evident for Montoni's concealing the circum&s;tance from her, if it had been made known to him: this both di&s;plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed her; but the chief &s;ubjects of her unea&s;ine&s;s were&mdash;the tempo|rary di&s;po&s;al of La Vallee, and the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of her father's old and faithful &s;ervant. "Poor There&s;a," &s;aid Emily, "thou had&s;t not &s;aved much in thy &s;ervitude, for thou wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t always tender to|wards the poor, and believd'&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t die in the family, where thy be&s;t years had been &s;pent. Poor There&s;a! now thou art turned out in thy old age to &s;eek thy bread!"</P>
<P>Emily wept bitterly as the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, and &s;he determined to con&s;ider what could be done for There&s;a, and to talk very explicitly to M. Que&s;nel on the &s;ub|ject;
<PB N="199" REF="029378_0100_0FE0807E05734F38">
but &s;he much feared that his cold heart could feel only for it&s;elf. She determined al&s;o to inquire whether he had made any mention of her affairs, in his letters to Montoni, who &s;oon gave her the opportunity &s;he &s;ought, by de&s;iring that &s;he would attend him in his &s;tudy. She had little doubt, that the inter|view was intended for the purpo&s;e of communicating to her a part of M. Que&s;nel's letter concerning the tran&s;actions at La Val|lee, and &s;he obeyed him immediately. Montoni was alone.</P>
<P>"I have ju&s;t been writing to Mon&s;. Que&s;nel," &s;aid he, when Emily appeared, "in reply to the letter I received from him a few days ago, and I wi&s;hed to talk to you upon a &s;ubject that occupied part of it."</P>
<P>"I al&s;o wi&s;hed to &s;peak with you on this topic, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"It is a &s;ubject of &s;ome intere&s;t to you, undoubtedly," re|joined Montoni, "and I think you mu&s;t &s;ee it in the light that I do; indeed it will not bear any other. I tru&s;t you will agree with me, that any objection &s;ounded on &s;entiment, as they call it, ought to yield to circum&s;tances of &s;olid advantage."</P>
<P>"Granting this, &s;ir," replied Emily, mode&s;tly, "tho&s;e of hu|manity ought &s;urely to be attended to. But I fear it is now too late to deliberate upon this plan, and I mu&s;t regret, that it is no longer in my power to reject it."</P>
<P>"It is too late," &s;aid Montoni, "but &s;ince it is &s;o, I am plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that you &s;ubmit to rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity with|out indulging u&s;ele&s;s complaint. I applaud this conduct exceed|ingly, the more, perhaps, &s;ince it di&s;covers a &s;trength of mind &s;eldom ob&s;ervable in your &s;ex. When you are older you will look back with gratitude to the friends who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in re&s;cu|ing you from the romantic illu&s;ions of &s;entiment, and will per|ceive, that they are only the &s;nares of childhood, and &s;hould be vanqui&s;hed the moment you e&s;cape from the nur&s;ery. I have not clo&s;ed my letter, and you may add a few lines to inform your uncle of your acquie&s;cence. You will &s;oon &s;ee him, for it is my intention to take you, with Madame Montoni, in a few days to Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">renti, and you can then talk over the affair."</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Montoni &s;miled &s;atirically at&punc; what Emily had written, but did not object to it, and &s;he withdrew to her own apartment, where &s;he &s;at down to begin a letter to Valancourt, in which &s;he related the particulars of her journey, and her arrival at Venice de&s;cribed &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking &s;cenes in the pa&s;&s;age over the Alps; her emotions on her fir&s;t view of Italy; the manners and characters of the people around her, and &s;ome few circum|&s;tances of Montoni's conduct. But &s;he avoided even naming Count Morano, much more the declaration he had made, &s;ince &s;he well knew how tremblingly alive to fear is real love, how jealou&s;ly watchful of every circum&s;tance that may effect its inter|e&s;t; and &s;he &s;crupulou&s;ly avoided to give Valancourt even the &s;lighte&s;t rea&s;on for believing he had a rival.</P>
<P>On the following day Count Morano dined again at Monto|ni's. He was in an uncommon flow of &s;pirits, and Emily thought there was &s;omewhat of exultation in his manner of ad|dre&s;&s;ing her, which &s;he had never ob&s;erved before. She endeav|oured to repre&s;s this by more than her u&s;ual re&s;erve, but the cold civility of her air now &s;eemed rather to encourage than to de|pre&s;s him. He appeared watchful of an opportunity of &s;peaking with her alone, and more than once &s;olicited this; but Emily always replied, that &s;he could hear nothing from him which he would be unwilling to repeat before the whole company.</P>
<P>In the evening, Madame Montoni and her party went out up|on the &s;ea, and as the Count led Emily to his <HI>zendaletto,</HI> he car|ried her hand to his lips and thanked her for the conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;he had &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wn him. Emily in extreme &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;plea&s;ure, ha&s;tily withdrew her hand, and concluded that he had &s;poken ironically; but, on reaching the &s;teps of the terrace, and ob&s;erv|ing by the livery, that it was the Count's <HI>zendaletto,</HI> which waited below, while the re&s;t of the party, having arranged them|&s;elves in the gondolas, were moving on, &s;he determined not to permit a &s;eparate conver&s;ation, and, wi&s;hing him a good evening, returned to the portico. The Count followed to expo&s;tulate and entreat, and Montoni, who then came out, rendered &s;o|licitation unnece&s;&s;ary, for, without conde&s;cending to &s;peak, he took her hand, and led her to the <HI>zendaletto.</HI> Emily was not

<P>"This caprice is intolerable," &s;aid he, "and &s;hall not be in|dulged: here is no impropriety in the ca&s;e."</P>
<P>At this moment, Emily's di&s;like of Count Morano aro&s;e to ab|horrence. That he &s;hould, with undaunted a&s;&s;urance, thus pur|&s;ue her, notwith&s;tanding all &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject of his addre&s;&s;es, and think, as it was evident he did, that her opin|ion of him was of no con&s;equence, &s;o long as his preten&s;ions were &s;anctioned by Montoni, added indignation to the di&s;gu&s;t which &s;he had felt towards him. She was &s;omewhat relieved by ob&s;erving that Montoni was to be of the party, who &s;eated him&s;elf on one &s;ide of her, while Morano placed him&s;elf on the other. There was a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments as the gondolieri prepared their oars, and Emily trembled from apprehen&s;ion of the di&s;cour&s;e that might follow this &s;ilence. At length &s;he collected courage to break it her&s;elf, in the hope of preventing fine &s;peeches from Morano, and reproof from Montoni. To &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remark which &s;he made, the latter returned a &s;hort and di&s;obliging reply; but Morano immediately followed with a general ob&s;ervation, which he contrived to end with a particu|lar compliment, and, though Emily pa&s;&s;ed it without even the notice of a &s;mile, he was not di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>"I have been impatient," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing Emily, "to ex|pre&s;s my gratitude; to thank you for your goodne&s;s; but I mu&s;t al&s;o thank Signor Montoni, who has allowed me this op|portunity of doing &s;o."</P>
<P>Emily regarded the Count with a look of mingled a&s;toni&s;h|ment and di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Why," continued he, "&s;hould you wi&s;h to dimini&s;h the de|light of this moment by the air of cruel re&s;erve?&mdash;Why &s;eek to throw me again into the perplexities of doubt, by teaching your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to contradict the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of your late declaration.

<P>"If I ever had di&s;gui&s;ed them, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, with recol|lected &s;pirit, "it would certainly be unnece&s;&s;ary any longer to do &s;o. I had hoped, &s;ir, that you would have &s;pared me any farther nece&s;&s;ity of alluding to them; but &s;ince you do not grant this, hear me declare, and for the la&s;t time, that your per&s;e|verance has deprived you even of the e&s;teem, which I was in|clined to believe you merited."</P>

"A&s;toni&s;hing!" exclaimed Montoni: "this is beyond even my expectation, though I have hitherto done ju&s;tice to the ca|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">!

Here is the offer of an alliance, which would do honour to any fam|ily; yours, you will recollect, is not noble; you long re&s;i&s;ted my remon&s;trances, but my honour is now engaged, and it &s;hall not be trifled with.&mdash;You &s;hall adhere to the declaration, which you have made me an agent to convey to the Count."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t certainly mi&s;take you, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily; "my an|&s;wers on the &s;ubject have been uniform; it is unworthy of you to accu&s;e me of caprice. If you have conde&s;cended to be my agent, it is an honour I did not &s;olicit. I my&s;elf have con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ured Count Morano, and you al&s;o, &s;ir, that I never can ac|cept the honour he offers me, and I now repeat the declaration."</P>
<P>The Count looked with an air of &s;urpri&s;e and inquiry at Montoni, who&s;e countenance al&s;o was marked with &s;urpri&s;e, but it was &s;urpri&s;e mingled with indignation.</P>
<P>"Here is confidence, as well as caprice?" &s;aid the latter. "Will you deny your own words, Madame?"</P>
<P>"Such a que&s;tion is unworthy of an an&s;wer, &s;ir;" &s;aid E|mily "blu&s;hing; you will recollect your&s;elf, and be &s;orry that you have a&s;ked it."</P>
<P>"Speak to the point," rejoined Montoni, in a voice of in|crea&s;ing vehemence. "Will you deny your own words; will you deny that you have acknowledged, only a few hours ago, that it was too late to recede from your engagements, and that you accepted the Count's hand."</P>
<P>"I will deny all this, for no words of mine ever imported it."</P>
<P>"A&s;toni&s;hing! Will you deny what you wrote to Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel, your uncle? if you do, your own hand will bear te&s;ti|mony again&s;t you. What have you now to &s;ay?" continued Montoni, ob&s;erving the &s;ilence and confu&s;ion of Emily.</P>
<P>"I now perceive, &s;ir, that you are under a very great error, and that I have been equally mi&s;taken."</P>
<P>"No more duplicity, I entreat; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e open and candid, if it be po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"I have always been &s;o, &s;ir; and can claim no merit in &s;uch conduct, for I have had nothing to conceal."</P>
<P>"How is this, Signor?" cried Morano, with trembling emotion.</P>
<P>"Su&s;pend your judgment, Count," replied Montoni, "the wiles of a female heart, are un&s;earchable. Now, Madam, your <HI>explanation."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="029378_0102_0FE0808B69961E40">
"Excu&s;e me, &s;ir, if I withhold my explanation till you appear willing to give me your confidence; a&s;&s;ertion at pre&s;ent can only &s;ubject me to in&s;ult."</P>
<P>"Your explanation, I entreat you!" &s;aid Morano.</P>
<P>"Well, well," rejoined Montoni, "I give you my confidence; let us hear this explanation."</P>
<P>"Let me lead to it then, by a&s;king a que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"As many as you plea&s;e," &s;aid Montoni, contemptuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"What, then, was the &s;ubject of your letter to M. Que&s;nel?"</P>
<P>"The &s;ame that was the &s;ubject of your note to him, certainly. You did well to &s;tipulate for my confidence before you demand|ed that que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t beg you will be more explicit, &s;ir; what was that &s;ubject?"</P>
<P>"What could it be, but the noble offer of Count Morano," &s;aid Montoni.</P>
<P>"Then, &s;ir, we entirely mi&s;underdood each other," replied Emily.</P>
<P>"We entirely mi&s;under&s;tood each other too, I &s;uppo&s;e," re|joined Montoni, "in the conver&s;ation which preceded the writ|ing of that note? I mu&s;t do you the ju&s;tice to own, that you are very ingenious at this &s;ame art of mi&s;under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>Emily tried to re&s;train the tears that came to her eyes, and to an&s;wer with becoming firmne&s;s. "Allow me, &s;ir, to explain my&s;elf fully, or to be wholly &s;ilent."</P>
<P>"The explanation may now be di&s;pen&s;ed with; it is antici|pated. If Count Morano &s;till thinks one nece&s;&s;ary, I will give him an hone&s;t one. You have changed your intention &s;ince our la&s;t conver&s;ation; and, if he can have patience and humility enough to wait till to morrow, he will probably find it changed again: but as I have neither the patience or the humility, which you expect from a lover, I warn you of the effect of my di&s;plea&s;ure!"</P>
<P>"Montoni, you are too precipitate," &s;aid the Count, who had li&s;tened to this conver&s;ation in extreme anxiety and impatience; "Signora, I entreat your own explanation of this affair!"</P>
<P>"Signor Montoni has &s;aid ju&s;tly," replied Emily, "that all explanation may now be di&s;pen&s;ed with; after what has pa&s;&s;ed I cannot &s;uffer my&s;elf to give one. It is &s;ufficient for me, and for you, &s;ir, that I repeat my late declaration; let me hope this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he la&s;t time it will be nece&s;&s;ary for me to repeat it&mdash;I never can accept the honour of your alliance."</P>
<P>"Charming Emily!" exclaimed the Count in an impa&s;&s;ioned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, "let not re&s;entment make you unju&s;t; let me not &s;uffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the offence of Montoni&punc;&mdash;Revoke&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="029378_0103_0FE0809110A9CAF8">
"Offence!" interrupted Montoni&mdash;"Count, this language is ridiculous, this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is childi&s;h!&mdash;&s;peak as becomes a man, not as the &s;lave of a petty tyrant." "You di&s;tract me, Signor; &s;uffer me to plead my own cau&s;e; you have already proved in&s;ufficient to it."</P>
<P>"All conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, "is wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince it can bring only pain to each of us: if you would oblige me, pur&s;ue it no farther."</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible, Madam, that I can thus ea&s;ily re&s;ign the ob|ject of a pa&s;&s;ion, which is the delight and torment of my life.&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;till love&mdash;&s;till pur&s;ue you with unremitting ardour;&mdash;when you &s;hall be convinced of the &s;trength and con&s;tancy of my pa&s;&s;ion, your heart mu&s;t &s;often into pity and repentance."</P>
<P>"Is this generous, &s;ir? is this manly? Can it either de&s;erve or obtain the e&s;teem you &s;olicit, thus to continue a per&s;ecution from which I have no pre&s;ent means of e&s;caping?"</P>
<P>A gleam of moonlight that fell upon Morano's countenance, revealed the &s;trong emotions of his &s;oul; and, glancing on Mon|toni di&s;covered the dark re&s;entment, which contra&s;ted his features.</P>
<P>"By heaven this is too much!" &s;uddenly exclaimed the Count; "Signor Montoni, you treat me ill; it is from you that I &s;hall look for explanation."</P>
<P>"From me, &s;ir! you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have it;" muttered Montoni, "if your di&s;cernment is indeed &s;o far ob&s;cured by pa&s;&s;ion, as to make explanation nece&s;&s;ary. And for you, Madam, you &s;hould learn, that a man of honour is not to be trifled with, though you may, perhaps, with impunity, treat a <HI>boy</HI> like a puppet."</P>
<P>This &s;arca&s;m rou&s;ed the pride of Morano, and the re&s;entment which he had felt at the indifference of Emily, being lo&s;t in in|dignation of the in&s;olence of Montoni, he determined to mor|tify him, by defending her.</P>
<P>"This al&s;o," &s;aid he, replying to Montoni's la&s;t words, "this al&s;o, &s;hall not pa&s;s unnoticed. I bid you learn, &s;ir, that you have a &s;tronger enemy than a woman to contend with: I will protect Signora St. Aubert from your threatened re&s;entment. You have mi&s;led me, and would revenge your di&s;appointed views upon the innocent."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;led you!" retorted Montoni with quickne&s;s, "is my conduct&mdash;my word"&mdash;then pau&s;ing while he &s;eemed endeavour|ing to re&s;train the re&s;entment, that fla&s;hed in his eyes, in the next moment he added, in a &s;ubdued voice, "Count Morano this is a language, a &s;ort of conduct to which I am not accu&s;|tomed:
<PB N="205" REF="029378_0103_0FE0809110A9CAF8">
it is the conduct of a pa&s;&s;ionate boy&mdash;as &s;uch, I pa&s;s it over in contempt."</P>
<P>"In contempt, Signor?"</P>
<P>"The re&s;pect I owe my&s;elf," rejoined Montoni, "requires, that I &s;hould conver&s;e more largely with you upon &s;ome points of the &s;ubject in di&s;pute. Return with me to Venice, and I will conde&s;cend to convince you of your error."</P>
<P>"Conde&s;cend, &s;ir! but I will not conde&s;cend to be &s;o con|ver&s;ed with."</P>
<P>Montoni &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly; and Emily, now terrified for the con&s;equences of what &s;he &s;aw and heard, could no longer be &s;ilent. She explained the whole &s;ubject upon which &s;he had mi&s;taken Montoni in the morning, declaring, that &s;he under|&s;tood him to have con&s;ulted her &s;olely concerning the di&s;po&s;al of La Vallee, and concluding with entreating, that he would write immediately to M. Que&s;nel, and rectify the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>But Montoni either was, or affected to be, &s;till incredulous: and Count Morano was &s;till entangled in perplexity. While &s;he was &s;peaking, however, the attention of her auditors had been diverted from the immediate occa&s;ion of their re&s;entment, and their pa&s;&s;ion con&s;equently became le&s;s. Montoni de&s;ired the Count would order his &s;ervants to row back to Venice, that he might have &s;ome private conver&s;ation with him; and Morano, &s;omewhat &s;oothed by his &s;oftened voice and manner, and eager to examine into the full extent of his difficulties complied.</P>
<P>Emily, comforted by this pro&s;pect of relea&s;e, employed the pre&s;ent moments in endeavouring, with conciliating care, to pre|vent any fatal mi&s;chief between the per&s;ons who &s;o lately had per&s;ecuted and in&s;ulted her.</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits revived, when &s;he heard once more the voice of &s;ong and laughter, re&s;ounding from the grand canal, and at length entered again between its &s;tately piazzas. The <HI>zendaletto</HI> &s;topped at Montoni's man&s;ion, and the Count ha&s;tily led her in|to the hall, where Montoni took his arm, and &s;aid &s;omething in a low voice, on which Morano ki&s;&s;ed the hand he held, not|with&s;tanding Emily's effort to di&s;engage it, and wi&s;hing her a good evening, with an accent and look &s;he could not mi&s;under|&s;tand, returned to his <HI>zendaletto</HI> with Montoni.</P>
<P>Emily, in her own apartment, con&s;idered with inten&s;e anxiety all the unju&s;t and tyrannical conduct of Montoni, the dauntle&s;s per&s;everance of Morano, and her own de&s;olate &s;ituation, re|moved from her friends and country. She looked in vain to Valancourt, confined by his profe&s;&s;ion to a di&s;tant kingdom, as
<PB N="206" REF="029378_0104_0FE0809D22EF0228">
her protector; but it gave her comfort to know, that there was, at lea&s;t, one per&s;on in the world, who would &s;ympathize in her afflictions, and who&s;e wi&s;hes would fly eagerly to relea&s;e her. Yet &s;he determined not to give him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pain by relating the rea&s;ons &s;he had to regret the having rejected his better judg|ment concerning Montoni; rea&s;ons, however, which could not induce her to lament the delicacy and di&s;intere&s;ted affection that had made her reject his propo&s;al for a clande&s;tine marriage. The approaching interview with her uncle &s;he regarded with &s;ome degree of hope, for &s;he determined to repre&s;ent to him the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of her &s;ituation, and to entreat that he would allow her to return to France with him and Madame Que&s;nel. Then, &s;ud|denly remembering that her beloved La Vallee, her only home was no longer at her command, her tears flowed anew, and &s;he feared that &s;he had little pity to expect from a man who, like M. Que&s;nel, could di&s;po&s;e of it without deigning to con&s;ult with her, and could di&s;mi&s;s an aged and faithful &s;ervant, de&s;ti|tute of either &s;upport or a&s;ylum. But, though it was certain, that &s;he had her&s;elf no longer a home in France, and few, very few friends there, &s;he determined to return, if po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he might be relea&s;ed from the power of Montoni, who&s;e particu|larly oppre&s;&s;ive conduct towards her&s;elf, and general character as to others, were ju&s;tly terrible to her imagination. She had no wi&s;h to re&s;ide with her uncle, M. Que&s;nel, &s;ince his beha|viour to her late father and to her&s;elf, had been uniformly &s;uch as to convince her, that in flying to him &s;he could only ob|tain an exchange of oppre&s;&s;ors; neither had &s;he the &s;lighte&s;t in|tention of con&s;enting to the propo&s;al of Valancourt for an im|mediate marriage, though this would give her a lawful and a generous protector, for the chief rea&s;ons, which had formerly influenced her conduct, &s;till exi&s;ted again&s;t it, while others, which &s;eemed to ju&s;tify the &s;tep, would now be done away; and his in|tere&s;t, his fame were at all times too dear to her, to &s;uffer her to con&s;ent to a union, which, at this early period of their lives, would probably defeat both. One &s;ure, and proper a&s;ylum, however, would &s;till be open to her in France. She knew that &s;he could board in the convent; where &s;he had formerly expe|rienced &s;o much kindne&s;s, and which had an affecting and &s;o|lemn claim upon her heart, &s;ince it contained the remains of her late father. Here &s;he could remain in &s;afety and tranquillity, till the term, for which La Vallee might be let &s;hould expire; or, till the arrangement of M. Motteville's affairs enabled her &s;o far to e&s;timate the remains of her fortune, as to judge whether it would be prudent for her to re&s;ide there.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="029378_0104_0FE0809D22EF0228">
Concerning Montoni's conduct with re&s;pect to his letters to M. Que&s;nel, &s;he had many doubts; however he might be at fir&s;t mi&s;taken on the &s;ubject, &s;he much &s;u&s;pected that he wilfully per|&s;evered in his error, as a means of intimidating her into a com|pliance with his wi&s;hes of uniting her to Count Morano. Whe|ther this was or was not the fact, &s;he was extremely anxious to explain the affair to M. Que&s;nel, and looked forward with a mix|ture of impatience, hope and fear, to her approaching vi&s;it.</P>
<P>On the following day, Madame Montoni, being alone with Emily, introduced the mention of Count Morano, by expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;he had not joined the party on the water the preceding evening, and at her abrupt departure to Venice. Em|ily then related what had pa&s;&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ed her concern for the mutual mi&s;take that had occured between Montoni and her&s;elf, and &s;olicited her aunt's kind offices in urging him to give a de|ci&s;ive denial to the Count's further addre&s;&s;es; but &s;he &s;oon per|ceived, that Madame Montoni had not been ignorant of the late conver&s;ation, when &s;he introduced the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>"You have no encouragement to expect from me," &s;aid her aunt, "in the&s;e notions. I have already given my opinion on the &s;ubject, and think Signor Montoni right in enforcing, by any means, your con&s;ent. If young per&s;ons will ye blind to their intere&s;t, and ob&s;tinately oppo&s;e it, why, the greate&s;t ble&s;|&s;ings they can have are friends, who will oppo&s;e their folly. Pray what preten&s;ions of any kind do you think you have to &s;uch a match as is now offered you."</P>
<P>"Not any whatever, Madam," replied Emily, "and, there|fore, at lea&s;t, &s;uffer me to be happy in my humility."</P>
<P>"Nay, niece, it cannot be denied, that you have pride enough; my poor brother, your father, had his &s;hare of pride too; though, let me add, his fortune did not ju&s;tify it."</P>
<P>Emily, &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed by the indignation, which this malevolent allu&s;ion to her father excited, and by the difficulty of rendering her an&s;wer as temperate as it &s;hould be reprehen&s;ive, he&s;itated for &s;ome moments, in a confu&s;ion, which highly grati|fied her aunt. At length &s;he &s;aid, "My father's pride, Ma|dam had a noble object&mdash;the happine&s;s which he knew could be derived only from goodne&s;s, knowledge and charity. As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;i&s;ted in his &s;uperiority, in point of fortune, to &s;ome per|&s;ons, it was not humbled by his inferiority, in that re&s;pect, to others. He never di&s;dained tho&s;e who were wretched by po|verty and misfortune; he did &s;ometimes de&s;pi&s;e per&s;ons, who, with many opportunities of happine&s;s, rendered them&s;elves mi&s;|erable

by vanity, ignorance and cruelty. I &s;hall think it my highe&s;t glory to emulate &s;uch pride."</P>
<P>"I do not pretend to under&s;tand any thing of the&s;e high flown &s;entiments, niece; you have all that glory to your&s;elf: I would teach you a little plain &s;en&s;e, and not have you &s;o wi&s;e as to de&s;pi&s;e happine&s;s."</P>
<P>"That would indeed not be wi&s;dom, but folly," &s;aid Emily, "for wi&s;dom can boa&s;t no higher attainment than happine&s;s; but you will allow, Madam, that our ideas of happine&s;s may differ. I cannot doubt, that you wi&s;h me to be happy, but I mu&s;t fear you are mi&s;taken in the means of making me &s;o."</P>
<P>"I cannot boa&s;t of a learned education, niece, &s;uch as your father thought proper to give you, and, therefore, do not pretend to under&s;tand all the&s;e fine &s;peeches about happine&s;s. I mu&s;t be contented to under&s;tand only common &s;en&s;e, and happy would it have been for you and your father, if that had been included in his education."</P>
<P>Emily was too much &s;hocked by the&s;e reflections on her fath|er's memory, to de&s;pi&s;e this &s;peech as it de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was about to &s;peak, but Emily quitted the room, and retired to her own, where the little &s;pirit &s;he had lately exerted yielded to grief and vexation, and left her only to her tears. From every review of her &s;ituation &s;he could derive, indeed, only new &s;orrow. To the di&s;covery, which had ju&s;t been forced upon her, of Montoni's unworthine&s;s, &s;he had now to add, that of the cruel vanity, for the gratification of which her aunt was about to &s;acrifice her; of the effrontery and cun|ning, with which, at the time that &s;he meditated the &s;acrifice, &s;he boa&s;ted of her tenderne&s;s, or in&s;ulted her victim; and of the venomous envy, which, as it did not &s;cruple to attack her father's character, could &s;carcely be expected to withhold from her own.</P>
<P>During the few days, that intervened between this conver&s;a|tion and the departure for Miarenti, Montoni did not once ad|dre&s;s him&s;elf to Emily. His looks &s;ufficiently declared his re|&s;entment; but that he &s;hould forbear to renew a mention of the &s;ubject of it, exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed her, who was no le&s;s a&s;ton|i&s;hed, that during three days, Count Morano neither vi&s;ited Montoni, or was named by him. Several conjectures aro&s;e in her mind. Sometimes &s;he feared that the di&s;pute between them had been revived, and had ended fatally to the Count. Some|times &s;he was inclined to hope, that wearine&s;s, or di&s;gu&s;t at her firm rejection of his &s;uit had induced him to relinqui&s;h it; and,
<PB N="209" REF="029378_0105_0FE080A1F0519D18">
at others, &s;he &s;u&s;pected that he had now recour&s;e to &s;tratagem, and forbore his vi&s;its, and prevailed with Montoni to forbear the repetition of his name, in the expectation that gratitude and genero&s;ity would prevail with her to give him the con&s;ent, which he could not hope from love.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time in vain conjecture, and alternate hopes and fears, till the day arrived when Montoni was to &s;et out for the villa of Miarenti, which, like the preceding ones, neither brought the Count or the mention of him.</P>
<P>Montoni having determined not to leave Venice, till towards evening, that he might avoid the heats, and catch the cool breezes of night, embarked about an hour before &s;un&s;et, with his family, in a barge for the Brenta. Emily &s;at alone near the &s;tern of the ve&s;&s;el, and, as it floated &s;lowly on, watched the gay and lofty city le&s;&s;ening from her view, till its palaces &s;eemed to &s;ink in the di&s;tant waves, while its loftier towers and domes, illumined by the declining &s;un, appeared on the horizon, like tho&s;e far-&s;een clouds which, in more northern climes, often linger on the we&s;t|ern verge, and catch the la&s;t light of a &s;ummer's evening. Soon after, even the&s;e grew dim, and faded in di&s;tance from her &s;ight; but &s;he &s;till &s;at gazing on the va&s;t &s;cene of cloudle&s;s &s;ky, and mighty waters, and li&s;tening in plea&s;ing awe to the deep-&s;ound|ing waves, while as her eyes glanced over the Adriatic, towards the oppo&s;ite &s;hores, which were, however, far beyond the reach of &s;ight, &s;he thought of Greece, and a thou&s;and cla&s;&s;ical remem|brances &s;tealing to her mind, &s;he experienced that pen&s;ive luxu|ry which is felt on viewing the &s;cenes of ancient &s;tory, and on comparing their pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ilence and &s;olitude with that of their former grandeur and animation. The &s;cenes of the Illiad illap&s;ed in glowing colours to her fancy&mdash;&s;cenes, once the haunt of heroes&mdash;now lonely, and in ruins; but which &s;till &s;hone, in the poet's &s;train, in all their youthful &s;plendour.</P>
<P>As her imagination painted with melancholy touches, the de|&s;erted plains of Troy, &s;uch as they appeared in this after-day, &s;he re-animated the land&s;cape with the following little &s;tory.</P>

<P>As Emily approached the &s;hores of Italy &s;he began to di&s;crim|inate the rich features and varied colouring of the land&s;cape. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he purpil hills, groves of orange, pine and cypre&s;s, &s;hading mag|nificent villas, and towns, ri&s;ing among vineyards and plantations. The noble Brenta, pouring its broad waves into the &s;ea, now appeared, and, when &s;he reached its mouth, the barge &s;topped, that the hor&s;es might be fa&s;tened which were to tow it up the &s;tream. This done, Emily gave a la&s;t look to the Adriatic, and to the dim &s;ail,
<Q><L>&mdash;"That from the &s;ky-mix'd wave</L>
<L>Dawns on the &s;ight,"</L></Q>
and the barge &s;lowly glided between the green and luxuriant &s;lopes of the river. The grandeur of the Palladian villas, that adorn the&s;e &s;hores, was con&s;iderably heightened by the &s;etting
<PB N="212" REF="029378_0107_0FE080B1C91A3728">
rays, which threw &s;trong contra&s;ts of light and &s;hade upon the porticos and long arcades, and beamed a mellow lu&s;tre upon the orangeries and the tall groves of pine and eypre&s;s, that overhung the building. The &s;cent of orange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> flowering myrtles, and other odoriferous plants were diffu&s;ed upon the air, and often, from the&s;e embowered retreats, a &s;train of mu&s;ic &s;tole on the calm, and "&s;oftened into &s;ilence."</P>
<P>The &s;un now &s;unk below the horizon, twilight fell over the land&s;cape, and Emily, wrapt in mu&s;ing &s;ilence, continued to watch its features gradually vani&s;hing into ob&s;curity. She re|membered her many happy evenings, when with St. Aubert &s;he had ob&s;erved the &s;hades of twilight &s;teal over a &s;cene as beauti|ful as this, from the gardens of La Vallee, and a tear fell to the memory of her father. Her &s;pirits were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into melan|choly by the influence of the hour, by the low murmur of the wave pa&s;&s;ing under the ve&s;&s;el, and the &s;tillne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> air, that trembled only at intervals with di&s;tant mu&s;ic:&mdash;why el&s;e &s;hould &s;he, at the&s;e moments, have looked on her attachment to Valan|court with pre&s;ages &s;o very afflicting, &s;ince &s;he had but lately received letters from him, that had &s;oothed for a while all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> anxieties? It now &s;eemed to her oppre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat &s;he had taken leave of him for ever, and that the countries, which &s;epa|rated them, would never more be retraced by her. She look|ed upon Count Morano with horror, as in &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this; but apart from him, a conviction, if &s;uch that may be called, which ari&s;es from no proof, and which &s;he knew not how to account for, &s;eized her mind&mdash;that &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee Va|lancourt again. Though &s;he knew, that neither Morano's &s;oli|citation, nor Montoni's commands had lawful power to enforce her obedience, &s;he regarded both with a &s;uper&s;titious dread, that they would finally prevail.</P>
<P>Lo&s;t in this melancholy reverie, and &s;hedding frequent tears, Emily was at length rou&s;ed by Montoni, and &s;he followed him to the cabin, where refre&s;hments were &s;pread, and her aunt was &s;eated alone. The countenance of Madame Montoni was in|flamed with re&s;entment that appeared to be the con&s;equence of &s;ome conver&s;ation &s;he had held with her hu&s;band, who regarded her with a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tain, and both pre&s;erved, for &s;ome time, a haughty &s;ilence. Montoni then &s;poke to Emily of Mon&s;. Que&s;nel: "You will not, I hope, per&s;i&s;t in di&s;claim|ing your knowledge of the &s;ubject in my letter to him?"</P>
<P>"I had hoped, &s;ir, that it was no longer nece&s;&s;ary for me to di&s;claim it," &s;aid Emily, "I had hoped, from your &s;ilence, that you was convinced of your error."</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="029378_0107_0FE080B1C91A3728">
"You have hoped impo&s;&s;ibilities then," replied Montoni; "I might as rea&s;onably have expected to find &s;incerity and uni|formity of conduct in one of your &s;ex, as you to convict me of error in this affair."</P>
<P>Emily blu&s;hed and was &s;ilent; &s;he now perceived too clearly, that &s;he had hoped an impo&s;&s;ibility, for, where no mi&s;take had been committed no conviction could follow; and it was evident, that Montoni's conduct had not been the con&s;equence of mi&s;|take, but of de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Anxious to e&s;cape from conver&s;ation, which was both afflict|ing and humiliating to her, &s;he &s;oon returned to the deck, and re&s;umed her &s;tation near the &s;tern, without apprehen&s;ion of cold, for no vapour ro&s;e from the water, and the air was dry and tran|quil; here, at lea&s;t, the benevolence of nature allowed her the quiet which Montoni had denied her el&s;ewhere. It was now pa&s;t midnight. The &s;tars &s;hed a kind of twilight, that &s;erved to &s;hew the dark outline of the &s;hores on either hand, and the gray &s;urface of the river; till the moon ro&s;e from behind a high palm grove, and &s;hed her mellow lu&s;tre over the &s;cene. The ve&s;&s;el glided &s;moothly on: amid the &s;tillne&s;s of the hour Emily heard, now and then, the &s;olitary voice of the bargemen on the bank, as they &s;poke to their hor&s;es: while, from a remote part of the ve&s;&s;el, with melancholy &s;ong,
<Q><L>&mdash;"The &s;ailor &s;ooth'd,</L>
<L>Beneath the trembling moon, the midnight wave."</L></Q></P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile anticipated her reception by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and Madame Que&s;nel; con&s;idered what &s;he &s;hould &s;ay on the &s;ub|ject of La Vallee; and then, to withhold her mind from more anxious topics, tried to amu&s;e her&s;elf by di&s;criminating the faint-drawn features of the land&s;cape repo&s;ing the moonlight. While her fancy thus wandered, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at a di&s;tance a building peep|ing between the moonlight trees, and, as the barge approached, heard voices &s;peaking, and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed the lofty portico of a villa, over&s;hadowed by groves of pine and &s;ycamore, which &s;he recollected to be the &s;ame, that had formerly been pointed out to her, as belonging to Madame Que&s;nel's relative.</P>
<P>The barge &s;topped at a flight of marble &s;teps, which led up the bank to a lawn. Lights appeared between &s;ome pillars be|yond the portico. Montoni &s;ent forward his &s;ervant, and then di&s;embarked with his family. They found Mon&s;. and Madame Que&s;nel, with a few friends, &s;eated on &s;ofas in the portico, en|joying the cool breeze of the night, and eating fruits and ices, while &s;ome of their &s;ervants at a little di&s;tance; on the river's
<PB N="214" REF="029378_0108_0FE080C0E45A36A0">
bank, were performing a &s;imple &s;erenade. Emily was now ac|cu&s;tomed to the way of living in this warm country, and was not &s;urpri&s;ed to find Mon&s;. and Madame Que&s;nel in their porti|co, two hours after midnight.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual &s;alutations being over, the company &s;eated them|&s;elves in the portico, and refre&s;hments were brought them from the adjoining hall, were a banquet was &s;pread, and &s;ervants at|tended. When the bu&s;tle of this meeting had &s;ub&s;ided, and Em|ily had recovered from the little flutter into which it, had thrown her &s;pirits, &s;he was &s;truck with the &s;ingular beauty of the hall, &s;o perfectly accommodated to the luxuries of the &s;ea|&s;on. It was of white marble, and the roof, ri&s;ing into an open eupola, was &s;upported by columns of the &s;ame material. Two oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the apartment, terminating in open porticos, admitted to the hall a full view of the gardens, and of the river &s;cenery; in the centre a fountain continually refre&s;hed the air, and &s;eemed to heighten the fragrance, that breathed from the &s;ur|rounding orangeries, whil&s;t its da&s;hing waters gave an agreeable and &s;oothing &s;ound. Etru&s;can lamps, &s;u&s;pended from the pil|lars, diffu&s;ed a brilliant light over the interior part of the hall, leaving the remoter porticos to the &s;ofter lu&s;tre of the moon.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Que&s;nel talked apart to Montoni of his own affairs, in his u&s;ual &s;train of &s;elf-importance; boa&s;ted of his new acqui&s;i|tions, and then affected to pity &s;ome di&s;appointments, which Montoni had lately &s;u&s;tained. Meanwhile, the latter, who&s;e pride at lea&s;t enabled him to de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch vanity as this, and who&s;e di&s;cernment at once detected under this a&s;&s;umed pity, the frivolous malignity of Que&s;nel's mind, li&s;tened to him in con|temptuous &s;ilence, till he named his niece, and then they left the portico, and walked away into the gardens.</P>
<P>Emily, however, &s;till atte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to Madame Que&s;nel, who &s;poke of France, for even the name of her native country was dear to her, and &s;he found &s;ome plea&s;ure in looking at a per&s;on, who had lately been in it. That country, too, was inhabited by Valancourt, and &s;he li&s;tened to the mention of it, with a faint hope, that he al&s;o would be named. Madame Que&s;nel, who, when &s;he was in France, had talked with rapture of Italy, now, that &s;he was in Italy, talked with equal prai&s;e of France, and endeavoured to excite the wonder and envy of her auditors by accounts of places, which they had not been happy enough to &s;ee. In the&s;e de&s;criptions &s;he not only impo&s;ed upon them, but upon her&s;elf, for &s;he never thought a pre&s;ent plea&s;ure equal to one that was pa&s;&s;ed; and thus the delicious climate, the fragrant
<PB N="215" REF="029378_0108_0FE080C0E45A36A0">
orangeries and all the luxuries, which &s;urrounded her, &s;lept un|noticed, while her fancy wandered over the di&s;tant &s;cenes of a nothern country.</P>
<P>Emily li&s;tened in vain for the name of Valancourt. Madame Montoni &s;poke in her turn of the delights of Venice, and of the plea&s;ure &s;he expected from vi&s;iting the fine ca&s;tle of Montoni, on the Appennine; which latter mention, at lea&s;t, was merely a re|taliating boa&s;t, for Emily well knew, that her aunt had no ta&s;te for &s;olitary grandeur, and, particularly, for &s;uch as the ca&s;tle of Udolpho promi&s;ed. Thus the party continued to conver&s;e, and, as far as civility would permit, to torter each other by mutual boa&s;ts, while they reclined on &s;ofas in the portico and were en|virond with delights both from nature and art, by which any hone&s;t minds would have been tempered to benevolence, and happy imaginations would have been &s;oothed into enchantment.</P>
<P>The dawn, &s;oon after, trembled in the ea&s;tern horizon, and the light tints of morning gradually expanding, &s;hewed the beau|tifully declining forms of the Italian mountains and the gleam|ing land&s;capes, &s;tretched at their feet. Then the &s;unbeams, &s;hooting up from behind the hills, &s;pread over the &s;cene that fine &s;affron tinge, which &s;eems <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> impart repo&s;e to all it touches. The land&s;cape no longer gleamed; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> glowing colours were revealed, except that its remoter features were &s;till &s;oftened and united in the mi&s;t of di&s;tance, who&s;e &s;weet effect was heightened to Emily by the dark verdure of the pines and cypre&s;&s;es, that overarched the foreground of the river.</P>
<P>The market people, pa&s;&s;ing with their boats to Venice, now formed; moving picture on the Brenta. Mo&s;t of the&s;e had lit|tle painted awnings, to &s;helter their owners from the &s;unbeams, which, together with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of fruit and flowers, di&s;played be|neath, and the ta&s;teful &s;implicity of the pea&s;ant girls, who watch|ed the rural trea&s;ures, rendered them gay and &s;triking objects. The &s;wift movement of the boats down the current, the quick glance of oars in the water, and now and then the pa&s;&s;ing cho|rus of pea&s;ants, who reclined under the &s;ail of their little bark, or the tones of &s;ome ru&s;tic in&s;trument, played by a girl, as &s;he &s;at near her &s;ylvan cargo, heightened the animation and fe&s;tivity of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>When Montoni and M. Que&s;nel had joined the ladies, the party left the portico for the gardens, where the charming &s;cenery &s;oon withdrew Emily's thoughts from painful &s;ubjects.

clu&s;ters of the pine and poplar, the luxuriant che&s;nut and oriental plane, threw all their pomp of &s;hade over the&s;e gardens; while bowers of flowering myrtle and other &s;picy &s;hrubs mingled their fragrance with that of flowers, who&s;e vivid and various colour|ing glowed with increa&s;ed effect beneath the contra&s;ted umbrage of the groves. The air al&s;o was continually refre&s;hed by rivu|lets, which, with more ta&s;te than fa&s;hion, had been &s;uffered to wander among the green rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Emily often lingered behind the party, to contemplate the di&s;tant land&s;cape, that clo&s;ed a vi&s;ta, or that gleamed beneath the dark foliage of the foreground;&mdash;the &s;piral &s;ummits of the mountains, touched with a purple tint, broken and &s;teep above, but &s;helving gradually to their ba&s;e; the open valley, marked by no formal lines of art; and the tall groves of cypre&s;s, pine and poplar, &s;ometimes embelli&s;hed by a ruined villa, who&s;e broken columns appeared between the branches of a pine, that &s;eemed to droop over their fall.</P>
<P>From other parts of the gardens, the character of the view was entirely changed, and the fine &s;olitary beauty of the land&s;cape &s;hifted for the crowded features and varied colouring of inhabita|tion.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now gaining fa&s;t upon the &s;ky, and the party quitted the gardens, and retired to repo&s;e.</P>

<P>EMILY &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of conver&s;ing alone with Mon&s;. Que&s;nel, concerning La Vallee. His an&s;wers to her in|quiries were conci&s;e, and delivered with the air of a man, who is con&s;cious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing ab&s;olute power and impatient of hearing it que&s;tioned. He declared, that the di&s;po&s;al of the place was a nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure; and that &s;he might con&s;ider her&s;elf indebt|ed to his prudence for even the &s;mall income that remained for her. "But, however," added he, "when this Venetian Count (I have forgot his name) marries you, your pre&s;ent di&s;agreeable &s;tate of dependence will cea&s;e. As a relation to you I rejoice in the circum&s;tance, which is &s;o fortunate for you, and I may add, &s;o unexpected by your friends."</P>

For &s;ome moments Emily was chilled into &s;ilence by this &s;peech; and, when &s;he attempted to undeceive him, concerning the purport of the note &s;he had inclo&s;ed in Montoni's letter, he appeared to have &s;ome private rea&s;on for di&s;believing her a&s;&s;er|tion, and, for a con&s;iderable time, per&s;evered in accu&s;ing her of capricious conduct. Being&punc; at length, however, convinced, that &s;he really di&s;liked Morano and had po&s;itively rejected his &s;uit, his re&s;entment was extravagant, and he expre&s;&s;ed it in terms equally pointed and inhuman; for, &s;ecretly flattered by the pro&s;|pect of a connection with a nobleman, who&s;e title he had affected to forget, he was incapable of feeling pity for whatever &s;uffer|ings of his niece might &s;tand in the way of his ambition.</P>
<P>Emily &s;aw at once in his manner all the difficulties, that await|ed her, and, though no oppre&s;&s;ion could have power to make her renounce Valancourt for Morano, her fortitude now trembled at an encounter with the violent pa&s;&s;ions of her uncle.</P>
<P>She oppo&s;ed his turbulence and indignation only by the mild dignity of a &s;uperior mind; but the gentle firmne&s;s of her con|duct &s;erved to exa&s;perate &s;till more his re&s;entment, &s;ince it com|pelled him to feel his own inferiority, and, when he left her, he declared, that, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her folly, both him&s;elf and Montoni would abandon her to the contempt of the world.</P>
<P>The calmne&s;s &s;he had a&s;&s;umed in his pre&s;ence failed Emily, when alone, and &s;he wept bitterly, and called frequently upon the name of her departed father, who&s;e advice to her from his death bed &s;he then remembered. "Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, "I do in|deed perceive how much more valuable is the &s;trength of forti|tude than the grace of &s;en&s;ibility, and I will al&s;o endeavour to fulfil the promi&s;e I then made; I will not indulge in unavailing lamentation, but will try to endure, with firmne&s;s, the oppre&s;&s;ion I cannot elude."</P>
<P>Somewhat &s;oothed by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of performing a part of St. Aubert's la&s;t reque&s;t, and of endeavouring to pur&s;ue the conduct which he would have approved, &s;he overcame her tears, and, when the company met at dinner, had recovered her u&s;ual &s;erenity of countenance.</P>
<P>In the cool of the evening, the ladies took the <HI>fre&s;co</HI> along the bank of the Brenta in Madame Que&s;nel's carriage. The &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emily's mind was in melancholy contra&s;t with the gay groups a&s;&s;embled beneath the &s;hades that overhung this enchanting &s;tream. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were dancing under the trees, and others reclining on the gra&s;s, taking ices and coffee and calmly enjoying the effect of a beautiful evening, on a luxuriant land&s;cape. Emily when &s;he
<PB N="218" REF="029378_0110_0FE080CFCBA65490">
looked at the &s;now-capt Apennines, a&s;cending in the di&s;tance, thought of Montoni's ca&s;tle, and &s;uffered &s;ome terror, le&s;t he &s;hould convey her thither, for the purpo&s;e of enforcing her obe|dience; but the thought vani&s;hed, when &s;he con&s;idered, that &s;he was as much in his power at Venice as &s;he could be el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>It was moonlight before the party returned to the villa, where &s;upper was &s;pread in the airy hall, which had &s;o much enchant|ed Emily's fancy, on the preceding night. The ladies &s;eated them&s;elves in the portico, till Mon&s;. Que&s;nel, Montoni and other gentlemen, &s;hould join them at table, and Emily endea|voured to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the tranquillity of the hour. Pre&s;ent|ly, a barge &s;topped at the &s;teps that led into the gardens, and, &s;oon after &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of Montoni and Que&s;nel, and then that of Morano, who, in the next moment, appeared. His compliments &s;he received in &s;ilence, and her cold air &s;eemed at fir&s;t to di&s;compo&s;e him; but he &s;oon recovered his u&s;ual gai|ety of manner, though the officious kindne&s;s of M. and Ma|dame Que&s;nel, Emily perceived di&s;gu&s;ted him. Such a degree of attention &s;he had &s;carcely believed could be &s;hewn by M. Que&s;nel, for &s;he had never before &s;een him otherwi&s;e than in the pre&s;ence of his inferiors or equals.</P>
<P>When &s;he could retire to her own apartment, her mind almo&s;t involuntarily dwelt on the mo&s;t probable means of prevailing with the Count to withdraw his &s;uit, and to her liberal mind none appeared more probable, than that of acknowledging to him a prior attachment and throwing her&s;elf upon his genero|&s;ity for a relea&s;e. When, however, on the following day, he re|newed his addre&s;&s;es, &s;he &s;hrunk from the adoption of the plan &s;he had formed. There was &s;omething &s;o repugnant to her ju&s;t pride, in laying open the &s;ecret of her heart to &s;uch a man as Morano, and in &s;uing to him for compa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he impati|ently rejected this de&s;ign and wondered, that &s;he could have pau&s;ed upon it for a moment. The rejection of his &s;uit &s;he re|peated in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive terms &s;he could &s;elect, mingling with it a &s;evere cen&s;ure of his conduct; but, though the Count ap|peared mortified by this, he per&s;evered in the mo&s;t ardent pro|fe&s;&s;ions of admiration, till he was interrupted and Emily relea&s;|ed by the pre&s;ence of Madame Que&s;nel.</P>
<P>During her &s;tay at this plea&s;ant villa, Emily was thus render|ed mi&s;erable by the a&s;&s;iduities of Morano, together with the cruelly exerted authority of M. Que&s;nel and Montoni, who, with her aunt, &s;eemed now more re&s;olutely determined upon this marriage than they had even appeared to be at Venice. M.
<PB N="219" REF="029378_0110_0FE080CFCBA65490">
Que&s;nel, finding that both argument and menace were ineffectual in enforcing an immediate conclu&s;ion to it, at length relinqui&s;hed his endeavours, and tru&s;ted to the power of Montoni and to the cour&s;e of events at Venice. Emily, indeed, looked to Venice with hope, for there &s;he would be relieved in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the per&s;ecution of Morano, who would no longer be an inhabi|tant of the &s;ame hou&s;e with her&s;elf, and from that of Montoni, who&s;e engagements would not permit him to be continually at home. But amid&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of her own misfortunes, &s;he did not forget tho&s;e of poor There&s;a, for whom &s;he pleaded with courageous tenderne&s;s to Que&s;nel, who promi&s;ed, in &s;light and general terms, that &s;he &s;hould not be forgotten.</P>
<P>Montoni, in a long conver&s;ation with M. Que&s;nel, arranged the plan to be pur&s;ued re&s;pecting Emily, and M. Que&s;nel propo|&s;ed to be at Venice, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be informed, that the nuptials were concluded.</P>
<P>It was new to Emily to part with any per&s;on, with whom &s;he was connected, without feelings of regret; the moment, however, in which &s;he took leave of M. and Madame Que&s;nel, was, per|haps, the only &s;atisfactory one &s;he had known in their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Morano returned in Montoni's barge, and Emily, as &s;he watched her gradual approach to that magic city, &s;aw at her &s;ide the only per&s;on, who occa&s;ioned her to view it with le&s;s than perfect delight. They arrived there about midnight, when Em|ily was relea&s;ed from the pre&s;ence of the Count, who, with Mon|toni, went to a Ca&s;ino, and &s;he was &s;uffered to retire to her own apartment.</P>
<P>On the following day, Montoni in a &s;hort conver&s;ation, which he held with Emily, informed her, that he would no longer be <HI>trifled</HI> with, and that, &s;ince her marriage with the Count would be &s;o highly advantageous to her, that folly only could object to at, and folly of &s;uch extent as was incapable of conviction, it &s;hould be celebrated without further delay, and if that was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, without her con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Emily, who had hitherto tried remon&s;trance, had now recour&s;e to &s;upplication, for di&s;tre&s;s prevented her from fore&s;eeing, that with a man of Montoni's di&s;po&s;ition, &s;upplication would be equally u&s;ele&s;s. She afterwards inquired by what right he ex|erted this unlimited authority over her? a que&s;tion, which her better judgment would have withheld her, in a calmer moment, from making, &s;ince it could avail her nothing, and would afford Montoni another opportunity of triumphing over her defencele&s;s condition.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="029378_0111_0FE080D5BB64DD50">
"By what right!" cried Montoni, with a malicious &s;mile, "by the right of my will; if you can elude that, I will not in|quire by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> you do &s;o. I now remind you, for the la&s;t time, that you are a &s;tranger in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> foreign country, and that it is your intere&s;t to make me your friend; you know the means; if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> compel me to become your enemy, I will venture to tell you, that the puni&s;hment &s;hall exceed your expectation. You may know I am not to be trifled with."</P>
<P>Emily continued, for &s;ometime after Montoni had left her, in a &s;tate of de&s;pair, or rather of &s;tupefaction; a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of mi&s;ery was all that remained in her mind. In this &s;ituation Madame Montoni <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound her, at the &s;ound of who&s;e voice Emily looked up, and her aunt, &s;omewhat &s;oftened by the expre&s;&s;ion of de&s;pair, that fixed her countenance, &s;poke in a manner more kind than &s;he had ever yet done. Emily's heart was touched; &s;he &s;hed tears, and, after weeping for &s;ometime, recovered &s;ufficient compo&s;ure to &s;peak on the &s;ubject of her di&s;tre&s;s, and to endea|vour to intere&s;t Madame Montoni in her behalf. But, though the compa&s;&s;ion of her aunt had been &s;urpri&s;ed, her ambition was not to be overcome, and her pre&s;ent object was to be the aunt of a Counte&s;s. Emily's efforts, therefore, were as un&s;ucce&s;sful as they had been with Montoni, and &s;he withdrew to her apart|ment to think and weep alone. How often did &s;he remember the parting &s;cene with Valancourt, and wi&s;h, that the Italian had mentioned Montoni's character with le&s;s re&s;erve! When her mind, however, had recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock of this beha|viour, &s;he con&s;idered, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to compel her alliance with Morano, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to repeat any part of the marriage ceremony; and &s;he per&s;evered in her re&s;olution to await Montoni's threatened vengeance rather than give her&s;elf for life to a man, whom &s;he mu&s;t have de&s;pi&s;ed for his pre&s;ent conduct, had &s;he never even loved Valan|court: yet &s;he trembled at the revenge &s;he thus re&s;olved to brave.</P>
<P>An affair, however, &s;oon after occurred, which &s;omewhat cal|led off Montoni's attention from Emily. The my&s;terious vi&s;its of Or&s;ino were renewed with more frequency &s;ince the return of the former to Venice. There were others, al&s;o, be&s;ides Or&s;ino, admitted to the&s;e midnight councils, and among them Cavigni and Verezzi. Montoni became more re&s;erved and au&s;tere in his manner than ever; and Emily, if her own intere&s;ts had not made her regardle&s;s of his, might have perceived, that &s;omething extraordinary was working in his mind.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="029378_0111_0FE080D5BB64DD50">
One night, on which a council was not held, Or&s;ino came in great agitation of &s;pirits, and di&s;patched his confidential &s;ervant to Montoni, who was at a Ca&s;ino, de&s;iring that he would return home immediately; but charging the &s;ervant not to mention his name. Montoni obeyed the &s;ummons, and, on meeting Or|&s;ino, was informed of the circum&s;tances, that occa&s;ioned his vi&s;it and his vi&s;ible alarm, with a part of which he was already ac|quainted.</P>
<P>A Venetian nobleman, who had, on &s;ome late occa&s;ion, provok|ed the hatred of Or&s;ino, had been way-laid and poniarded by hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins: and, as the murdered per&s;on was of the fir&s;t con|nections, the Senate had taken up the affair. One of the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins was now apprehended, who had confe&s;&s;ed, that Or&s;ino was his employer in the attrocious deed; and the latter informed of his danger, had now come to Montoni to con&s;ult on the mea|&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to favour his e&s;cape. He knew, that at this time, the officers of the police were upon the watch for him, all over the city; to leave it at pre&s;ent, therefore was impractica|ble, and Montoni con&s;ented to &s;ecrete him for a few days till the vigilance of ju&s;tice &s;hould relax, and then to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in quit|ting Venice. He knew the danger he him&s;elf incurred by per|mitting Or&s;ino to remain in his hou&s;e, but &s;uch was the nature of his obligations to this man, that he did not think it prudent to refu&s;e him an a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>Such was the per&s;on whom Montoni had admitted to his con|fidence, and for whom he felt as much friend&s;hip as was com|patible with his character.</P>
<P>While Or&s;ino remained concealed in his hou&s;e, Montoni was unwilling to attract public ob&s;ervation by the nuptials of Count Morano; but this ob&s;tacle was, in a few days, overcome by the departure of his criminal vi&s;itor, and he then informed Emily, that her marriage was to be celebrated on the following morning. To her repeated a&s;&s;urances, that it &s;hould not take place, he re|plied only by a malignant &s;mile; and telling her, that the Count and a prie&s;t would be at his hou&s;e early in the morning, he ad|vi&s;ed her no further to dare his re&s;entment, by oppo&s;ition to his will and to her own intere&s;t. "I am now going out for the evening," &s;aid he, "remember, that I &s;hall give your hand to Count Morano in the morning." Emily, having, ever &s;ince his late threats, expected, that her trials would at length arrive to this cri&s;is, was le&s;s &s;hocked by the declaration, than &s;he otherwi&s;e would have been, and &s;he endeavoured to &s;upport her&s;elf by the belief, that the marriage could not be valid, &s;o long as &s;he refu|&s;ed
<PB N="222" REF="029378_0112_0FE080E4938B3838">
before the prie&s;t to repeat any part of the ceremony. Yet, as the moment of trial approached, her long hara&s;&s;ed &s;pirits &s;hrunk almo&s;t equally from the encounter of his vengeance, and from the hand of Count Morano. She was not even perfectly certain of the con&s;equence of her &s;teady refu&s;al at the alter, and &s;he trembled, more than ever, at the power of Montoni, which &s;eemed unlimited as his will, for &s;he &s;aw, that he would not &s;cru|ple to tran&s;gre&s;s any law, if, by &s;o doing, he could accompli&s;h his project.</P>
<P>While her mind was thus &s;uffering and in a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction, &s;he was informed that Morano a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her, and the &s;ervant had &s;carcely departed with an excu&s;e, before &s;he repented that &s;he had &s;ent one. In the next moment, reverting to her former de&s;ign, and determining to try, whether reverting to her former de&s;ign, and determining to try, whether expo&s;tulation and entreaty would not &s;ucceed, where a refu&s;al and a ju&s;t di&s;dain had failed, &s;he recalled the &s;ervant, and, &s;end|ing a different me&s;&s;age, prepared to go down to the Count.</P>
<P>The dignity and a&s;&s;umed compo&s;ure with which &s;he met him, and the kind of pen&s;ive re&s;ignation, that &s;oftened her counte|nance were circum&s;tances not likely to induce him to relinqui&s;h her, &s;erving, as they did, to heighten a pa&s;&s;ion, which had al|ready intoxicated his judgment. He li&s;tened to all &s;he &s;aid with an appearance of complacency and of a wi&s;h to oblige her; but his re&s;olution remained invariably the &s;ame, and he endeavoured to win her admiration by every in&s;inuating art he &s;o well knew how to practi&s;e. Being, at length, a&s;&s;ured, that &s;he had nothing to hope from his ju&s;tice, &s;he repeated, in a &s;olemn and impre&s;&s;ive manner, her ab&s;olute rejection of his &s;uit, and quitted him with an a&s;&s;urance, that her refu&s;al would be effectually maintained again&s;t every circum&s;tance, that could be imagined for &s;ubduing it. A ju&s;t pride had re&s;trained her tears in his pre&s;ence, but now they flowed from the fulne&s;s of her heart. She often called upon the name of her late father, and often dwelt with unutter|able angui&s;h on the idea of Valancourt.</P>
<P>She did not go down to &s;upper, but remained alone in her apartment, &s;ometimes yielding to the influence of grief and ter|ror, and, at others, endeavouring to fortify her mind again&s;t them, and to prepare her&s;elf to meet, with compo&s;ed courage, the &s;cene of the following morning, when all the &s;tratagem of Mo|rano and the violence of Montoni would be united again&s;t her.</P>
<P>The evening was far advanced, when Madame Montoni came to her chamber with &s;ome bridal ornaments, which the Count had &s;ent to Emily. She had, this day, purpo&s;ely avoided her
<PB N="223" REF="029378_0112_0FE080E4938B3838">
niece; perhaps, becau&s;e her u&s;ual in&s;en&s;ibility failed her, and &s;he feared to tru&s;t her&s;elf with a view of Emily's di&s;tre&s;s; or po&s;&s;ibly, though her con&s;cience was &s;eldom audible, it now re|proached her with her conduct to her brother's orphan child, who&s;e happine&s;s had been entru&s;ted to her care by a dying father.</P>
<P>Emily could not look at the&s;e pre&s;ents, and made a la&s;t, though almo&s;t hopele&s;s effort to intere&s;t the compa&s;&s;ion of Mad|ame Montoni, who, if &s;he did feel any degree of pity, or re|mor&s;e, &s;ucce&s;sfully concealed it, and reproached her niece with folly in being mi&s;erable, concerning a marriage, which ought only to make her happy. "I am &s;ure," &s;aid &s;he, "if I was unmarried, and the Count had propo&s;ed to me, I &s;hould have been flattered by the di&s;tinction: and if I &s;hould have been &s;o, I am &s;ure, niece, you, who have no fortune, ought to feel your|&s;elf highly honoured, and &s;hew a proper gratitude and humility towards the Count, for his conde&s;cen&s;ion. I am often &s;urpri&s;ed, I mu&s;t own, to ob&s;erve how humbly he deports him&s;elf to you, notwith&s;tanding the haughty airs you give your&s;elf; I wonder he has patience to humour you &s;o: if I was he, I know, I &s;hould often be ready to reprehend you, and make you know your&s;elf a little better. I would not have flattered you, I can tell you, for it is this ab&s;urd flattery that makes you fancy your&s;elf of &s;o much con&s;equence, that you think nobody can de&s;erve you, and I often tell the Count &s;o, for I have no patience to hear him pay you &s;uch extravagant compliments, which you believe every word of!"</P>
<P>"Your patience, madam, cannot &s;uffer more cruelly on &s;uch occa&s;ions, than my own," &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"O! that is all mere affectation," rejoined her aunt. "I know that his flattery delights you, and makes you &s;o vain, that you think you have the whole world at your feet. But you are very much mi&s;taken; I can a&s;&s;ure you, niece, you will not meet with many &s;uch &s;uitors as the Count: every other per&s;on would have turned upon his heels, and left you to repent at your lei&s;ure, long ago."</P>
<P>"O that the Count had re&s;embled every other per&s;on, then!" &s;aid Emily with a heavy &s;igh.</P>
<P>"It is happy for you, that he does not," rejoined Madame Montoni; "and what I am now &s;aying is from pure kindne&s;s. I am endeavouring to convince you of your good fortune, and to per&s;uade you to &s;ubmit to nece&s;&s;ity with a good grace. It is nothing to me, you know, whether you like this marriage or not, for it mu&s;t be; what I &s;ay therefore, is from pure kindne&s;s.
<PB N="224" REF="029378_0113_0FE080E9289A9B88">
I wi&s;h to &s;ee you happy, and it is your own fault if you are not &s;o. I would a&s;k you, now, &s;eriou&s;ly and calmly, what kind of a match you can expect, &s;ince a Count cannot content your ambition?"</P>
<P>"I have no ambition whatever, madam," replied Emily, "my only wi&s;h is to remain in my pre&s;ent &s;tation."</P>
<P>"O! that is &s;peaking quite from the purpo&s;e," &s;aid her aunt, "I &s;ee you are &s;till thinking of Mon&s;. Valancourt. Pray get rid of all tho&s;e fanta&s;tic notions about love, and this ridiculous pride, and be &s;omething like a rea&s;onable creature. But, how|ever, this is nothing to the purpo&s;e&mdash;for your marriage with, the Count takes place to-morrow, you know, whether you approve it or not. The Count will be trifled with no longer."</P>
<P>Emily made no attempt to reply to this curious &s;peech; &s;he felt it would be mean, and &s;he knew it would be u&s;ele&s;s. Ma|dame Montoni laid the Count's pre&s;ents upon the table, on which Emily was leaning, and then, de&s;iring &s;he would be ready early in the morning, bade her good night. "Good night, madam," &s;aid Emily, with a deep &s;igh, as the door clo&s;ed upon her aunt, and &s;he was left once more to her own &s;ad reflections. For &s;ome|time &s;he &s;at lo&s;t in thought, as to be wholly uncon&s;cious where &s;he was; at length, rai&s;ing her head, and looking round the room, its gloom and profound &s;tillne&s;s awed her. She fixed her eyes on the door, thro' which her aunt had di&s;appeared, and li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly for &s;ome &s;ound, that might relieve the deep dejection of her &s;pirits; but it was pa&s;t midnight, and all the family, ex|cept the &s;ervant, who &s;at up for Montoni, had retired to bed. Her mind, long hara&s;&s;ed by di&s;tre&s;s, now yielded to imaginary terrors; &s;he trembled to look into the ob&s;curity of her &s;pacious chamber, and feared &s;he knew not what; a &s;tate of mind, which continued &s;o long, that &s;he would have called up Annette, her aunt's woman, had her fears permitted her to ri&s;e from her chair, and to cro&s;s the apartment.</P>
<P>The&s;e melancholy illu&s;ions at length began to di&s;per&s;e, and &s;he retired to her bed, not to &s;leep, for that was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible, but to try, at lea&s;t, to quiet her di&s;turbed fancy, and to collect &s;trength of &s;pirits &s;ufficient to bear her through the &s;cene of the approaching morning.</P>

<P>EMILY was recalled from a kind of &s;lumber, into which &s;he had at length, &s;unk, by a quick knocking at her chamber door. She &s;tarted up in terror, for Montoni and Count Morano in&s;tant|ly came to her mind; but, having li&s;tened in &s;ilence for &s;ome|time, and recogni&s;ing the voice of Annette, &s;he ro&s;e and open|ed the door. "What brings you hither &s;o early?" &s;aid Emily, trembling exce&s;&s;ively. She was unable to &s;upport her&s;elf, and &s;at down on the bed.</P>
<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid Annette, "do not look &s;o pale. I am quite frightened to &s;ee you. Here is a fine bu&s;tle below &s;tairs, all the &s;ervants running to and fro, and none of them fa&s;t enough! Here is a bu&s;tle, indeed all of a &s;udden, and nobody knows for what!"</P>
<P>"Who is below be&s;ides them?" &s;aid Emily, "Annette, do not trifle with me!"</P>
<P>"Not for the world, ma'am&s;elle, I would not trifle for the world; but one cannot help making one's remarks, and there is the Signor in &s;uch a bu&s;tle, as I never &s;aw him before; and he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me to tell you, ma'am to get ready immediately."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="029378_0116_0FE080F58738D4C8">
"Good God &s;upport me!" cried Emily, almo&s;t fainting, "Count Morano is below, then!"</P>
<P>"No, ma'am&s;elle, he is not below that I know of," replied Annette, "only his <HI>Excellenza,</HI> &s;ent me to de&s;ire you would get ready directly to leave Venice, for that the gondolas would be at the &s;teps of the canal in a few minutes; but I mu&s;t hurry back to my lady, who is ju&s;t at her wits end, and knows not which way to turn for ha&s;te."</P>
<P>"Explain, Annette, explain the meaning of all this before you go," &s;aid Emily, &s;o overcome with &s;urpri&s;e and timid hope, that &s;he had &s;carcely breath to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"Nay, ma'am&s;elle, that is more than I can do. I only know that the Signor is ju&s;t come home in a very ill humour, that he has had us all called out of our beds, and tells us we are all to leave Venice immediately."</P>
<P>"Is Count Morano to go with the Signor?" &s;aid Emily, "and whither are we going?"</P>
<P>"I know neither, ma'am, for certain; but I heard Ludovico &s;ay &s;omething about going, after we got to <HI>Terrafirma,</HI> to the Signor's ca&s;tle among &s;ome mountains, that he talked of."</P>
<P>"The Apennines!" &s;aid Emily, eagerly, "O! then I have little to hope!"</P>
<P>"That is the very place ma'am. But cheer up, and do not take it &s;o much to heart, and think what a little time you have got to get ready in, and how impatient the Signor is. Holy St. Mark! I hear the oars on the canal; and now they come nearer, and now they are da&s;hing at the &s;teps below; it is the gondola, &s;ure enough."</P>
<P>Annette ha&s;tened from the room; and Emily prepared for this unexpected flight as fa&s;t as her trembling hands would per|mit, not perceiving, that any change in her &s;ituation could po&s;|&s;ibly be for the wor&s;e. She had &s;carcely thrown her books and clothes into her travelling trunk, when receiving a &s;econd &s;um|mons, &s;he went down to her aunt's dre&s;&s;ing-room, where &s;he found Montoni impatiently reproving his wife for delay. He went out, &s;oon after, to give &s;ome further orders to his people, and Emily then inquired the occa&s;ion of this ha&s;ty journey; but her aunt appeared to be as ignorant as her&s;elf, and to undertake the journey with more reluctance.</P>
<P>The family at length embarked, but neither Count Morano, or Cavigni, was of the party. Somewhat revived by ob&s;erving this, Emily, when the gondolieri da&s;hed their oars in the water, and put off from the &s;teps of the portico, felt like a criminal,
<PB N="5" REF="029378_0116_0FE080F58738D4C8">
who receives a &s;hort reprieve. Her heart beat yet lighter, when they emerged from the canal into the ocean, and lighter &s;till, when they &s;kimmed pa&s;t the walls of St. Mark, without having &s;topped to take up Count Morano.</P>
<P>The dawn now began to tint the horizon, and to break upon the &s;hores of the Adriatic. Emily did not venture to a&s;k any que&s;tions of Montoni, who &s;at, for &s;ometime, in gloomy &s;ilence, and then rolled him&s;elf up in his cloak, as if to &s;leep, while Madame Montoni did the &s;ame; but Emily, who could not &s;leep, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ndrew one of the little curtains of the gondola, and looked out upon the &s;ea. The ri&s;ing dawn now enlightened the mountain|tops of Friuli, but their lower &s;ides, and the di&s;tant waves, that rolled at their feet, were &s;till in deep &s;hadow. Emily, &s;unk in tranquil melancholy, watched the &s;trengthening light &s;preading upon the ocean, &s;hewing &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, Venice and her i&s;lets, and the &s;hores of Italy, along which boats, with their pointed latin &s;ails, began to move.</P>
<P>The gondolieri were frequently hailed, at this early hour, by the market-people, as they glided by towards Venice, and the <HI>Lagune</HI> &s;oon di&s;played a gay &s;cene of innumerable little barks, pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Terrafirma</HI> with provi&s;ions. Emily gave a la&s;t look to that &s;plendid city, but her mind was then occupied by con&s;idering the probable events that awaited her, in the &s;cenes, to which &s;he was removing, and with conjectures, concerning the motive of this &s;udden journey. It appeared, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;ideration, that Montoni was removing her to his &s;ecluded ca&s;tle, becau&s;e he could there, with more probability of &s;ucce&s;s, attempt to terrify her into obedience; or, that, &s;hould its gloomy and &s;eque&s;tered &s;cenes fail of this effect, her forced marriage with the Count could there be &s;olemnized with the &s;ecrecy, which was nece&s;&s;ary to the honour of Montoni. The little &s;pirit, which this reprieve had recalled, now began to fail, and, when Emily reached the &s;hore, her mind had &s;unk into all its former depre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Montoni did not embark on the Brenta, but pur&s;ued his way in carriages acro&s;s the country, towards the Apennine; during which journey, his manner to Emily was &s;o particularly &s;evere, that this alone would have confirmed her late conjecture, had any &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> been nece&s;&s;ary. Her &s;en&s;es were now dead to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> beautiful country, through which &s;he travelled.&mdash;Sometimes &s;he was compelled to &s;mile at the <HI>naive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> of Annette, in her remarks on what &s;he &s;aw, and &s;ometimes to &s;igh, as a &s;cene of peculiar beauty recalled Valancourt to her thoughts,
<PB N="6" REF="029378_0117_0FE08106588C5128">
who was indeed &s;eldom ab&s;ent from them, and of whom &s;he could never hope to hear in the &s;olitude, to which &s;he was ha&s;t|ening.</P>
<P>At length, the travellers began to a&s;cend among the Apen|nines. The immen&s;e pine fore&s;ts, which, at that period, over|hung the&s;e mountains, and between which the road wound, ex|cluded all view but of the cliffs a&s;piring above, except, that, now and then, an opening through the dark woods allowed the eye a momentary glim&s;e of the country below. The gloom of the&s;e &s;hades, their &s;olitary &s;ilence, except when the breeze &s;wept over their &s;ummits, the tremendous precipices of the mountains, that came partially to the eye, each a&s;&s;i&s;ted to rai&s;e the &s;olemnity of Emily's feelings into awe; &s;he &s;aw only images of gloomy grandeur, or of dreadful &s;ublimity, around her; other images, equally gloomy and equally terrible, gleamed on her imagina|tion. She was going &s;he &s;carcely knew whither, under the do|minion of a per&s;on, from who&s;e arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition &s;he had al|ready &s;uffered &s;o much, to marry, perhaps, a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither her affection or e&s;teem; or to endure, beyond the hope of &s;uccour, whatever puni&s;hment revenge, and that Italian re|venge, might dictate. The more &s;he con&s;idered what might be the motive of the journey, the more &s;he became convinced, that it was for the purpo&s;e of concluding her nuptials with Count Morano, with that &s;ecrecy which her re&s;olute re&s;i&s;tance had made nece&s;&s;ary to the honour, if not to the &s;afety of Montoni. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the deep &s;olitudes, into which &s;he was emerging, and from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gloomy ca&s;tle, of which &s;he had heard &s;ome my&s;terious hints, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ick heart recoiled in de&s;pair, and &s;he experienced, that, though her mind was already occupied by peculiar di&s;tre&s;s, it was &s;till alive to the influence of new and local circum&s;tance; why el&s;e did &s;he &s;hudder at the idea of this de&s;olate ca&s;tle?</P>
<P>As the travellers &s;till a&s;cended among the pine fore&s;ts, &s;teep ro&s;e over &s;teep, the mountains &s;eemed to multiply, as they went, and what was the &s;ummit of one eminence proved to be only the ba&s;e of another. At length, they reached a little plain, where the drivers &s;topped to re&s;t the mules, whence a &s;cene of &s;uch extent and magnificence opened below, as drew even from Madame Montoni a note of admiration. Emily lo&s;t, for a mo|ment, her &s;orrows, in the immen&s;ity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Beyond the amphitheatre of mountains that &s;tretched below, who&s;e tops ap|peared as numerous almo&s;t, as the waves of the &s;ea, and who&s;e feet were concealed by the fore&s;ts&mdash;extended the <HI>Campagna</HI> of Italy, where cities and rivers, and woods and all the glow of
<PB N="7" REF="029378_0117_0FE08106588C5128">
cultivation were mingled in gay confu&s;ion. The Adriatic bound|ed the horizon, into which the Po and the Brenta, after winding through the whole extent of the land&s;cape, poured their fruitful waves. Emily gazed long on the &s;plendours of the world &s;he was quitting, of which the whole magnificence &s;eemed thus given to her &s;ight only to increa&s;e her regret on leaving it; for her, Valancourt alone was in that world; to him alone her heart turned, and for him alone fell her bitter tears.</P>
<P>From this &s;ublime &s;cene the travellers continued to a&s;cend among the pines, till they entered a narrow pa&s;s of the moun|tains, which &s;hut out every feature of the di&s;tant country, and, in its &s;tead, exhibited only tremendous crags, impending over the road, where no ve&s;tige of humanity, or even of vegitation, appeared, except here and there the trunk and &s;cathed branches of an oak, that hung nearly headlong from the rock, into which its &s;trong roots had fa&s;tened. This pa&s;s, which led into the heart of the Apennine, at length opened to day, and a &s;cene of mountains &s;tretched in long per&s;pective, as wild as any the tra|vellers had yet pa&s;&s;ed. Still va&s;t pine-fore&s;ts hung upon their ba&s;e, and crowned their ridgy precipice, that ro&s;e perpendicular|ly from the vale, while, above, the rolling mi&s;ts caught the &s;un|beams, and touched their cliffs with all the magical colouring of light and &s;hade. The &s;cene &s;eemed perpetually changing, and its features to a&s;&s;ume new forms, as the winding road brought them to the eye in different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; while the &s;hifting va|pours, now partially concealing then minuter beauties, and now illuminating them with &s;plendid tints, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the illu&s;ions of the &s;ight.</P>
<P>Though the deep vallies between the&s;e mountains were, for the mo&s;t part, clothed with pines, &s;ometimes an abrupt opening pre&s;ented a per&s;pective of only barren rocks, with a cataract fla&s;hing from their &s;ummit among broken cliffs, till its waters, reaching the bottom, foamed along with uncea&s;ing fury; and &s;ometimes pa&s;toral &s;cenes exhibited their "green delights" in the narrow vales, &s;miling amid &s;urrounding horror. There herds and flocks of goats and &s;heep, brow&s;ing under the &s;hade of hanging woods, and the &s;hepherd's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cabin, reared on the margin of a clear &s;tream, pre&s;ented a &s;weet picture of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Wild and romantic as were the&s;e &s;cenes, their character had far le&s;s of the &s;ublime, than had tho&s;e of the Alps, which guard the entrance of Italy. Emily was often elevated, but &s;eldom felt tho&s;e emotions of inde&s;cribable awe, which &s;he had &s;o continu|ally experienced, in her pa&s;&s;age over the Alps.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="029378_0118_0FE0810B610381F0">
Towards the clo&s;e of day, the road wound into a deep valley. Mountains, who&s;e &s;haggy &s;teeps appeared to be inacce&s;&s;ible, almo&s;t &s;urrounded it. To the ea&s;t, a vi&s;ta opened, that exhibited the Apennines in their darke&s;t horrors: and the long per&s;pective of retiring &s;ummits, ri&s;ing over each other, their ridges clothed with pines, exhibited a &s;tronger image of grandeur, than any that Emily had yet &s;een. The &s;un had ju&s;t &s;unk below the top of the mountains &s;he was de&s;cending, who&s;e long &s;hadow &s;tretch|ed athwart the valley, but his &s;loping rays, &s;hooting through an opening of the cliffs, touched with a yellow gleam the &s;ummits of the fore&s;t, that hung upon the oppo&s;ite &s;teeps, and &s;treamed in full &s;plendour upon the towers and battlements of a ca&s;tle, that &s;pread its exten&s;ive ramparts along the brow of a precipice above. The &s;plendour of the&s;e illumined objects was heightend by the contra&s;ted &s;hade, which involved the valley below:</P>
<P>"There," &s;aid Montoni, &s;peaking for the fir&s;t time in &s;everal hours, "is Udolpho."</P>
<P>Emily gazed with melancholy awe upon the ca&s;tle, which &s;he under&s;tood to be Montoni's; for, though it was now lighted up by the &s;etting &s;un, the gothic greatne&s;s of its features, and its mouldering walls of dark gray &s;tone, rendered it a gloomy and &s;ublime o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ject. As &s;he gazed, the light died away on its walls, leaving a melancholy purple tint, which &s;pread deeper and deep|er, as the thin vapour crept up the mountain, while the battle|ments above were &s;till tipped with &s;plendour. From tho&s;e too, the rays &s;oon faded, and the whole edifice was inve&s;ted with the &s;olemn du&s;kine&s;s of evening. Silent, lonely and &s;ublime, it &s;eemed to &s;tand the &s;overeign of the &s;cene, and to frown defiance on all, who dared to invade its &s;olitary reign. As the twilight deepened, its features became more awful in ob&s;curity, and Em|ily continued to gaze, till its clu&s;tering towers were alone &s;een, ri&s;ing over the tops of the woods, beneath who&s;e thick &s;hade the carriages &s;oon after began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>The extent and darkne&s;s of the&s;e tall woods awakened terrific images in her mind, and &s;he almo&s;t expected to &s;ee banditti &s;tart up from under the trees. At length the carriages emerged upon a heathy rock, and, &s;oon after, reached the ca&s;tle gates, where the deep tone of the portal bell, which was &s;truck upon to give notice of their arrival, increa&s;ed the fearful emotions, that had a&s;|&s;ailed Emily. While they waited till the &s;ervant within &s;hould come to open the gates, &s;he anxiou&s;ly &s;urveyed the edifice: but the gloom, that over&s;pread it, allowed her to di&s;tingui&s;h little more than a part of its outline, with the ma&s;&s;y walls of the ram|parts,
<PB N="9" REF="029378_0118_0FE0810B610381F0">
and to know, that it was va&s;t, ancient and dreary. From the parts &s;he &s;aw, &s;he judged of the heavy &s;trength and extent of the whole. The gateway before her, leading into the courts, was of gigantic &s;ize, and was defended by two round towers, crowned by overhanging turrets, embattled, where, in&s;tead of banners, now waved long gra&s;s and wild plants, that had taken root among the mouldering &s;tones, and which &s;eemed to &s;igh as the breeze rolled pa&s;t, over the de&s;olation around them. The towers were united by a curtain, pierced and embattled al&s;o, below which ap|peared the pointed arch of a huge portcullis, &s;urmounting the gates: from the&s;e, the walls of the ramparts extended to other towers, overlooking the precipice, who&s;e &s;hattered outline, appearing on a gleam, that lingered in the we&s;t, told of the ravages of war. Beyond the&s;e all was lo&s;t in the ob&s;curity of evening.</P>
<P>While Emily gazed with awe upon the &s;cene, foot&s;teps were heard within the gates, and the undrawing of bolts; after which an ancient &s;ervant of the ca&s;tle appeared, forcing back the huge folds of the portal, to admit his lord. As the carriage-wheels rolled heavily under the portcullis, Emily's heart &s;unk, and &s;he &s;eemed, as if &s;he was going into her pri&s;on; the gloomy court, into which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;erved to confirm the idea, and her imag|ination, ever awake to circum&s;tance, &s;ugge&s;ted even more terrors, than her rea&s;on could ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>Another gate delivered them into the &s;econd court, gra&s;s-grown, and more wild than the fir&s;t, where, as &s;he &s;urveyed through the twilight its de&s;olation&mdash;its lofty walls, overtopt with briony, mo&s;s and night&s;hade, and the embattled towers that ro&s;e above, long &s;uffering and murder came to her thoughts. One of tho&s;e in&s;tantaneous and unaccountable convictions which &s;ometimes conquer even &s;trong minds, impre&s;&s;ed her with its horror. The &s;entiment was not dimini&s;hed, when &s;he entered an exten&s;ive gothic hall, ob&s;cured by the gloom of evening, which a light, glimmering at a di&s;tance through a long per&s;pective of arches, only rendered more &s;triking. As a &s;ervant brought the lamp nearer, partial gleams fell upon the pillars and the pointed arches, forming a &s;trong contra&s;t with their &s;hadows, that &s;tretched along the pavement and the walls. The &s;udden journey of Montoni had prevented his people from making any other pre|parations for his reception, than could be had in the &s;hort inter|val, &s;ince the arrival of the &s;ervant, who had been &s;ent forward from Venice; and this, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, may account for the air of extreme de&s;olation, that every where appeared.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="029378_0119_0FE0811ABB3ACFB0">
The &s;ervant, who came to light Montoni, bowed in &s;ilence, and the mu&s;cles of his countenance relaxed with no &s;ymptom of joy. Montoni noticed the &s;alutation by a &s;light motion of his hand, and pa&s;&s;ed on, while his lady, following, and looking round with a degree of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;content, which &s;he &s;eemed fearful of expre&s;&s;ing, and Emily, &s;urveying the extent and gran|deur of the hall in timid wonder, approached a marble &s;tairca&s;e. The arches here opened to a lofty vault, from the centre of which hung a tripod lamp, which a &s;ervant was ha&s;tily lighting; and the rich fretwork of the roof, a corridor, leading into &s;everal up|per apartments, and a painted window, &s;tretching nearly from the pavement to the ceiling of the hall, became gradually vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Having cro&s;&s;ed the foot of the &s;tairca&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed through an anti-room, they entered a &s;pacious apartment, who&s;e walls, wain&s;coted with black larch wood&punc; the growth of the neighbour|ing mountains, were &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from darkne&s;s it&s;elf. "Bring more light," &s;aid Montoni, as he entered. The &s;ervant &s;etting down his lamp, was withdrawing to obey him, when Ma|dame Montoni ob&s;erving, that the evening air of this mountain|ous region was cold, and that &s;he &s;hould like a fire, Montoni ordered that wood might be brought.</P>
<P>While he paced the room with thoughtful &s;teps, and Madame Montoni &s;at &s;ilently on a couch, at the upper end of it, waiting till the &s;ervant returned, Emily was ob&s;erving the &s;ingular &s;o|lemnity and de&s;olation of the apartment, viewed, as it now was, by the glimmer of the &s;ingle lamp, placed near a large Ve|netian mirror, that du&s;kily reflected the &s;cene, with the tall figure of Montoni pa&s;&s;ing &s;lowly along, his arms folded, and his countenance &s;haded by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lume that waved in his hat.</P>
<P>From the contemplation of this &s;cene, Emily's mind pro|ceeded to the apprehen&s;ion of what &s;he might &s;uffer in it, till the remembrance of Valancourt, far, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tant! came to her heart, and &s;oftened it into &s;orrow. A heavy &s;igh e&s;caped her; but, trying to conceal her tears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he walked away to one of the high windows, that opened upon the ramparts, below which, &s;pread the woods &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in her approach to the ca&s;tle. But the night&s;hade &s;at deeply on the mountains beyond, and their in|den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d outline alone could be faintly traced on the horizon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> yet glimmered in the we&s;t.

<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">&punc; upon which Emily turned on the opening of the door, was &s;carcely le&s;s gloomy. The old &s;ervant who had re|ceived them at the gates, now entered, bending under a lead of

pine branches, while two of Montoni's Venetian &s;ervants follow|ed with lights.</P>
<P>"Your <HI>Excellenza</HI> is welcome to the ca&s;tle," &s;aid the old man, as he rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the hearth, where he had laid the wood: "it has been a lonely place a long while; but you will excu&s;e it, Signor, knowing we had but &s;hort notice. It is near two years, come next fea&s;t of St. Mark, &s;ince your <HI>Excellenza</HI> was within the&s;e walls."</P>
<P>"You have a good memory, old Carlo," &s;aid Montoni: "it is thereabout; and how ha&s;t thou contrived to live &s;o long."</P>
<P>"A-well-a-day, &s;ir, with much ado; the cold winds, that blow through the ca&s;tle in winter, are almo&s;t too much for me; and I thought &s;ometimes of a&s;king your <HI>Excellenza</HI> to let me leave the mountains, and go down into the lowlands. But I don't know how it is&mdash;I am loath to quit the&s;e old walls I have lived in &s;o long."</P>
<P>"Well, how have you gone on in the ca&s;tle, &s;ince I left it?" &s;aid Montoni.</P>
<P>"Why much as u&s;ual, Signor, only it wants a good deal of repairing. There is the north tower, &s;ome of the battlements have tumbled down, and had liked one day to have knocked my poor wife (God re&s;t her &s;oul!) on the head. Your <HI>Excellenza</HI> mu&s;t know"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well, but the repairs," interrupted Montoni.</P>
<P>"Aye, the repairs," &s;aid Carlo: "a part of the roof of the great hall has fallen in, and all the winds from the mountains ru&s;hed through it la&s;t winter, and whi&s;tled through the whole ca&s;tle &s;o, that there was no keeping one's &s;elf warm, be were one would. There, my wife and I u&s;ed to &s;it &s;hivering over a great fire in one corner of the little hall, ready to die with cold, and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But there are no more repairs wanted," &s;aid Montoni, im|patiently.</P>
<P>"O Lord! your <HI>Excellenza,</HI> yes&mdash;the wall of the rampart has tumbled down in three places; then, the &s;tairs that lead to the we&s;t gallery, have been a long time &s;o bad, that it is danger|ous to go up them; and the pa&s;&s;age leading to the great oak chamber, that overhangs the north rampart&mdash;one night la&s;t win|ter I ventured to go there by my&s;elf, and your <HI>Excellenza"</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well, well, enough of this," &s;aid Montoni, with quickne&s;s: "I will talk more with thee to-morrow."</P>
<P>The fire was now lighted; Carlo &s;wept the hearth, placed chairs, wiped the du&s;t from a large marble table that &s;tood near it, and then left the room.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="029378_0120_0FE0811F8B743870">
Montoni and his family drew round the fire. Madame Mon|toni made &s;everal attempts at conver&s;ation, but his &s;ullen an&s;wers repul&s;ed her, while Emily &s;at endeavouring to acquire courage enough to &s;peak to him. At length, in a tremulous voice, &s;he &s;aid, "May I a&s;k, &s;ir, the motive of this &s;udden journey?" Af|ter a long pau&s;e, &s;he recovered &s;ufficient courage to repeat the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"It does not &s;uit me to an&s;wer inquiries," &s;aid Montoni, "nor does it become you to make then; time may unfold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all: but I de&s;ire I may be no further hara&s;&s;ed, and I recommend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to you to retire to your chamber, and to endeavour to adopt a more rational conduct, than that of yielding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and to a &s;en&s;ibility, which, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> came, is only a weakne&s;s."</P>
<P>Emily ro&s;e to withdraw. "Good night madam," &s;aid &s;he to her aunt, with an a&s;&s;umed compo&s;ure, that could not di&s;gui&s;e her emotion.</P>
<P>"Good night, my dear," &s;aid Madame Montoni, in a tone of kindne&s;s, which her niece had never before heard from her: and the unexpected endearment brought tears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emily's eyes. She curt&s;ied to Montoni, and was retiring; "But you do not know the way to your chamber," &s;aid her aunt. Montoni called the &s;ervant, who waited in the anti-room, and bade him &s;eed Madame Montoni's woman, with whom, in a few minutes, Emily withdrew.</P>
<P>"Do you know which is my room?" &s;aid &s;he to Annette, as they cro&s;&s;ed the hall.</P>
<P>"Yes, I believe I do, ma'am&s;elle; but this is &s;uch a &s;trange rambling place! I have been lo&s;t in it already: they call it the double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over the &s;outh rampart, and I went up this great &s;tairca&s;e to it. My lady's room is at the other end of the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>Emily a&s;cended the marble &s;tairca&s;e, and came to the corridor, as they pa&s;&s;ed through which, Annette re&s;umed her chat. "What a wild lonely place this is, ma'am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall be quite frightened to live in it. How often, and often I have wi&s;hed my&s;elf in France again! I little thought, when I came with my lady to &s;ee the world, that I &s;hould ever be &s;hut up in &s;uch a place as this, or I would never have left my own country! This way, ma'am&s;elle, down this turning, I can almo&s;t believe in giants again, and &s;uch like, for this is ju&s;t like one of their ca&s;tles; and, &s;ome night or other; I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> too, hopping about in that great old ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, that looks more like a church, with its huge pil|lars, than any thing el&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="029378_0120_0FE0811F8B743870">
"Yes," &s;aid Emily, &s;miling, and glad to e&s;cape from more &s;erious thought, "if we come to the corridor, about midnight, and look down into the hall, we &s;hall certainly &s;ee it illuminated with a thou&s;and lamps, and the fairies tripping in gay circles to the &s;ound of delicious mu&s;ic; for it is in &s;uch places as this, you know, that they come to hold their revels. But I am afraid, Annette, you will not be able to pay the nece&s;&s;ary penance for &s;uch a &s;ight: and, if once they hear your voice, the whole &s;cene will vani&s;h in an in&s;tant."</P>
<P>"O! if you will bear me company, ma'am&s;elle, I will come to the corridor, this very night, and I promi&s;e you I will hold my tongue; it &s;hall n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t be my fault if the &s;how vani&s;hes.&mdash;But do you think they will come?"</P>
<P>"I cannot promi&s;e that with certainty, but I will venture to &s;ay, it will not be your fault if the enchantment &s;hould vani&s;h."</P>
<P>"Well, ma'am&s;elle, that is &s;aying more than I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> you: but I am not &s;o much afraid of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> they &s;ay there are a plentiful many of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> now I &s;hould be frightened to death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I &s;hould chance to &s;ee any of them.

<P>"Ridiculous!" &s;aid Emily, "you mu&s;t not indulge &s;uch fan|cies."</P>
<P>"O ma'am! they are not fancies, for aught I know; Bene|detto &s;ays the&s;e di&s;mal galleries and halls are fit for nothing but gho&s;ts to live in; and I verily believe, if I <HI>live</HI> long in them I &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to one my&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"I hope," &s;aid Emily, "you will not &s;uffer Signor Montoni to hear of the&s;e weak fears; they would highly di&s;plea&s;e him."</P>
<P>"What, you know then, ma'am&s;elle, all about it!" rejoined Annette. "No, no, I do know better than to do &s;o; though, if the Signor can &s;leep &s;ound, nobody el&s;e in the ca&s;tle has any right to lie awake, I am &s;ure." Emily did not appear to notice this remark.</P>
<P>"Down this pa&s;&s;age, ma'am&s;elle; this leads to a back &s;tair|ca&s;e. O! if I &s;ee any thing, I &s;hall be frightened out of my wits!"</P>
<P>"That will &s;carcely be po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Emily, &s;miling, as &s;he followed the winding of the pa&s;&s;age, which opened into another gallery: and then Annette, perceiving that &s;he had mi&s;&s;ed her way, while &s;he had been &s;o eloquently haranguing on gho&s;ts and fairies, wandered about through other pa&s;&s;ages and galleries, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, at length, frightened by their intricacies and de&s;olation, &s;he call|ed

aloud for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but they were beyond the hearing of the &s;ervants, who were on the other &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, and Emi|ly now opened the door of a chamber on the left.</P>
<P>"O! do not go in there, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "you will only lo&s;e your&s;elf further."</P>
<P>"Bring the light forward," &s;aid Emily, "we may po&s;&s;ibly find our way through the&s;e rooms."</P>
<P>Annette &s;tood at the door, in an attitude of he&s;itation, with the light held up to &s;hew the chamber, but the feeble rays &s;pread through not half of it. "Why do you he&s;itate?" &s;aid Emily, "let me &s;ee whither this room leads."</P>
<P>Annette advanced reluctantly. It opened into a &s;uite of &s;pe|cious and ancient apartments, &s;ome of which were hung with ta|pe&s;try, and others wain&s;coted with cedar and black larch wood. What furniture there was, &s;eemed to be almo&s;t as old as the rooms, and retained an appearance of grandeur, though covered with du&s;t, and dropping to pieces with the damps, and with age.</P>
<P>"How cold the&s;e rooms are, ma'am&s;elle?" &s;aid Annette: "nobody has lived in them for many, many years, they &s;ay. Do let us go."</P>
<P>"They may open upon the great &s;tairca&s;e, perhaps," &s;aid Emily, pa&s;&s;ing on till &s;he came to a chamber, hung with pictures, and took the light to examine that of a &s;oldier on hor&s;eback in a field of battle.&mdash;He was darting his &s;pear upon a man, who lay under the feet of the hor&s;e, and who held up one hand in a &s;upplicating attitude. The &s;oldier who&s;e beaver was up, re|garded him with a look of vengeance, and the countenance, with that expre&s;&s;ion, &s;truck Emily as re&s;embling Montoni. She &s;hud|dered, and turned from it. Pa&s;&s;ing the light ha&s;tily over &s;everal other pictures, &s;he came to one concealed by a veil of black &s;ilk. The &s;ingularity of the circum&s;tance &s;truck her, and &s;he &s;topped before it, wi&s;hing to remove the veil, and examine what could thus carefully be concealed, but &s;omewhat wanting cour|age. "Holy Virgin! what can this mean?" exclaimed An|nette. "This is &s;urely the picture they told me of at Venice."</P>
<P>"What picture?" &s;aid Emily. "Why a picture&mdash;a picture," replied Annette, he&s;itatingly&mdash;"but I never could make out ex|actly what it was about, either."</P>
<P>"Remove the veil, Annett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">."</P>
<P>"What! I, ma'am&s;elle!&mdash;I! not for the world!" Emily, turning round, &s;aw Annette's countenance grow pale. "And pray, what have you heard of this picture, to terrify you &s;o, my

good girl?" &s;aid &s;he. "Nothing ma'am&s;elle: I have heard nothing, only let us find our way out."</P>
<P>"Certainly: but I wi&s;h fir&s;t to examine the picture; take the light, Annette, while I lift the veil." Annette took the light, and immediately walked away with it, di&s;regarding Emily's calls to &s;tay, who, not choo&s;ing to be left alone in the dark chamber, at length followed her. "What is the rea&s;on of this, Annette?" &s;aid Emily, when &s;he overtook her, "what have you heard con|cerning that picture, which makes you &s;o unwilling to &s;tay when I bid you?"</P>
<P>"I don't know what is the rea&s;on, ma'am&s;elle," replied An|nette, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> any thing about the picture, only I have heard there is &s;omething very dreadful belonging to it&mdash;and that it has been covered up in black <HI>ever &s;ince</HI>&mdash;and that nobody has looked at it for a great many years&mdash;and it &s;omehow has to do with the owner of this ca&s;tle before Signor Montoni came to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it&mdash;and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well, Annette" &s;aid Emily, &s;miling, "I perceive it is as you &s;ay&mdash;that you know nothing about the picture."</P>
<P>"No, nothing, indeed, ma'am&s;elle, for they made me pro|mi&s;e never to tell: but"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well," rejoined Emily, who ob&s;erved that &s;he was &s;truggling between her inclination to reveal a &s;ecret, and her apprehen&s;ion for the con&s;equence, "I will inquire no further"&mdash;</P>
<P>"No, pray, ma'am, do not."</P>
<P>"Le&s;t you &s;hould tell all," interrupted Emily.</P>
<P>Annette blu&s;h'd, and Emily &s;miled, and they pa&s;&s;ed on to the extremity of this &s;uite of apartments, and found them&s;elves after &s;ome further perplexity, once more at the top of the marble &s;tair|ca&s;e, where Annette left Emily, while &s;he went to call one of the &s;ervants of the ca&s;tle to &s;hew them to the chamber, for which they had been &s;eeking.</P>
<P>While &s;he was ab&s;ent, Emily's thoughts returned to the pic|ture; an unwillingne&s;s to tamper with the integrity of a &s;ervant had checked her inquiries on this &s;ubject, as well as concerning &s;ome alarming hints, which Annette had dropped re&s;pecting Montoni; though her curio&s;ity was entirely awakened, and &s;he had perceived, that her que&s;tions might ea&s;ily be an&s;wered. She was now, however, inclined to go back to the apartment and examine the picture; but the loneline&s;s of the hour and of the place, with the melancholy &s;ilence that reigned around her, con|&s;pired with a certain degree of awe, excited by the my&s;tery at|tending this picture, to prevent her. She determined, however,
<PB N="16" REF="029378_0122_0FE08131804D0E90">
when daylight &s;hould have re-animated her &s;pirits, to go thither and remove the veil. As &s;he leaned from the corridor, over the &s;tairca&s;e, and her eyes wandered round, &s;he again ob|&s;erved, with wonder, the va&s;t &s;trength of the walls, now &s;ome|what decayed, and the pillars of &s;olid marble, that ro&s;e from the hall, and &s;upported the roof.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant now appeared with Annette, and conducted Emily to her chamber, which was in a remote part of the ca&s;tle, and at the end of the very corridor, from whence the &s;uite of apart|ments opened, through which they had been wandering. The lonely a&s;pect of her room made Emily unwilling that Annette &s;hould leave her immediately, and the dampne&s;s of it chilled her with more than fear. She begged Caterina, the &s;ervant of the ca&s;tle, to bring &s;ome wood and light a fire.</P>
<P>"Aye, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, it's many a year &s;ince a fire was lighted here, &s;aid Caterina.</P>
<P>"You need not tell us that, good woman," &s;aid Annette; "every room in the ca&s;tle feels like a well. I wonder how you contrive to live here; for my part, I wi&s;h my&s;elf at Venice again." Emily waved her hand for Caterina to fetch the wood.</P>
<P>"I wonder, ma'am, why they call this the double chamber?" &s;aid Annette, while Emily &s;urveyed it in &s;ilence, and &s;aw th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> it was lofty and &s;pacious, like the others &s;he had &s;een, and, like many of them, too, had its walls lined with dark larch-wood&punc; The bed and other furniture was very ancient, and had an air <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gloomy grandeur, like all that &s;he had &s;een in the ca&s;tle. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the high ca&s;ements, which &s;he opened, overlooked a rampart but the view beyond was hid in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ence of Annette, Emily tried to &s;upport her &s;pirit and to re&s;train the tears, which, every now and then, came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her eyes. She wi&s;hed much to inquire when Count Morano was expected at the ca&s;tle, but an unwillingne&s;s to a&s;k unnece&s;|&s;ary que&s;tions, and to mention family concerns to a &s;ervant withheld her. Meanwhile, Annette's thoughts were engaged up|on another &s;ubject: &s;he dearly loved the marvellous, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heard of a circum&s;tance connected with the ca&s;tle, that highly gratified this ta&s;te. Having been enjoined not to mention it her inclination to tell it was &s;o &s;trong, that &s;he was every in|&s;tant on the point of &s;peaking what &s;he had heard. Such a &s;trange circum&s;tance, too, and to be obliged to conceal it, was a &s;ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> puni&s;hment; but &s;he knew, that Montoni might impo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much &s;everer, and &s;he feared to incur it by offending him.</P>
<P>Caterina now brought the wood, and its bright blaze di&s;po&s;|ed,
<PB N="17" REF="029378_0122_0FE08131804D0E90">
for a while, the gloom of the chamber. She told Annette that her lady had inquired for her, and Emily was once again left to her own &s;ad reflections. Her heart was nor yet harden|ed again&s;t the &s;tern manners of Montoni, and &s;he was nearly as much &s;hocked now, as &s;he had been when &s;he fir&s;t witne&s;&s;ed them. The tenderne&s;s and affection, to which &s;he had been ac|cu&s;tomed, till &s;he lo&s;t her parents, had made her particularly &s;en&s;ible to any degree of unkindne&s;s, and &s;uch a rever&s;e as this no apprehen&s;ion had prepared her to &s;upport.</P>
<P>To call off her attention from &s;ubjects, that pre&s;&s;ed heavily upon her &s;pirits, &s;he ro&s;e and again examined her room and its furniture. As &s;he walked round it, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a door, that was not quite &s;hut, and, perceiving, that it was not the one, through which &s;he entered, &s;he brought the light forward to di&s;cover whither it led. She opened it, and, going forward, had nearly fallen down a &s;teep, narrow &s;tairca&s;e, that wound from it, be|tween two &s;tone walls. She wi&s;hed to know to what it led, and was the more anxious, &s;ince it communicated &s;o immediately with her apartment; but, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits, &s;he wanted courage to venture into the darkne&s;s alone. Clo&s;ing the door, therefore, &s;he endeavoured to fa&s;ten it, but, upon fur|ther examination, perceived, that it had no bolts on the cham|ber &s;ide, though it had two on the other. By placing a heavy chair again&s;t it, &s;he in &s;ome mea&s;ure remedied the defect; yet &s;he was &s;till alarmed at the thought of &s;leeping in this remote room alone, with a door opening &s;he knew not whither, and which could not be perfectly fa&s;tened on the in&s;ide. Sometimes &s;he wi&s;hed to entreat of Madame Montoni, that Annette might have leave to remain with her all night, but was deterred by an apprehen&s;ion of betraying what would be thought childi&s;h fears, and by an unwillingne&s;s to increa&s;e the apt terrors of Annette.</P>
<P>Her gloomy reflections were, &s;oon after interrupted by a foot|&s;tep in the corridor, and &s;he was glad to &s;ee Annette enter with &s;ome &s;upper, &s;ent by Madame Montoni. Having a table near the fire, &s;he made the good girl &s;it down and &s;up with her; and, when their little repa&s;t was over, Annette, encouraged by her kindne&s;s and &s;tirring the wood into a blaze, drew her chair up|on the hearth, nearer to Emily, and &s;aid,&mdash;"Did you ever hear ma'am&s;elle, of the &s;trange accident, that made the Signor lord of this ca&s;tle?"</P>
<P>"What wonderful &s;tory have you now to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll?" &s;aid Emily concealing the curio&s;ity, occa&s;ioned by the my&s;terious hints &s;he had formerly heard on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="029378_0123_0FE081406994E1D8">
"I have heard all about it, ma'am&s;ell," &s;aid Annette, looking round the chamber and drawing clo&s;er to Emily; "Benedetto told it me as we travelled together: &s;ays he, "Annette, you don't know about this ca&s;tle here, that we are going to? No, &s;ays I, Mr. Benedetto, pray what do you know? But, ma'am|&s;elle, you can keep a &s;ecret, or I would not tell it you for the world; for I promi&s;ed never to tell, and they &s;ay, that the Signor does not like to have it talked of."</P>
<P>"If you promi&s;ed to keep this &s;ecret," &s;aid Emily, "you do right not to mention it."</P>
<P>Annette pau&s;ed a moment, and then &s;aid, "O, but to you, ma'am&s;elle, to you I may tell it &s;afely, I know."</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled, "I certainly &s;hall keep it as faithfully as your|&s;elf, Annette."</P>
<P>Annette replied very gravely, that would do, and proceeded&mdash;"This ca&s;tle, you mu&s;t know, ma'am&s;elle, is very old, and very &s;trong, and has &s;tood out many &s;ieges, as they &s;ay. Now it was not Signor Montoni's always, nor his father's, no; but by &s;ome, law or other, it was to come to the Signor, if the lady died un|married."</P>
<P>"What lady?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"I am not come to that yet," replied Annette, "it is the la|dy I am going to tell you about, ma'am&s;elle&punc; but, as I was &s;ay|ing, this lady lived in the ca&s;tle, and had every thing very grand about her, as you may &s;uppo&s;e ma'am&s;elle. The Signor u&s;ed of|ten to come to &s;ee her, and was in love with her, and offered to marry her; for, though he was &s;omehow related, that did not &s;ignify. But &s;he was in love with &s;omebody el&s;e, and would not have him, which made him very angry, as they &s;ay, and you know ma'am&s;elle, what an ill looking gentleman he is, when he is angry. Perhaps &s;he &s;aw him in a pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore would not have him. But, as I was &s;aying, &s;he was very melancholy and unhappy, and all that, for a long while, and&mdash;Holy Virgin! what noi&s;e is that? did not you hear a &s;ound, ma'am&s;elle?"</P>

<P>"As I was &s;aying&mdash;O, where was I?&mdash;as I was &s;aying&mdash;&s;he was very melancholy and unhappy a long while, and u&s;ed to walk about upon the terrace, there, under the windows, by her|&s;elf, and cry &s;o! it would have done your heart good to hear her.

"All in good time, ma'am; all this I heard before at Venice, but what is to come I never heard till to day. This happened a great many years ago, when Signor Montoni was quite a young man. The lady they called her Signora Laurentini, was very hand&s;ome, but &s;he u&s;ed to be in great pa&s;&s;ions, too, &s;ometimes, as well as the Signor. Finding he could not make her li&s;ten to him&mdash;what does he do but leave the ca&s;tle, and never comes near it for a long time! but it was all one to her; &s;he was ju&s;t as unhappy whether he was here or not, till one evening, Holy St. Peter! ma'am&s;elle," cried Annette, "look at that lamp, &s;ee how blue it burns!" She looked fearfully round the chamber. "Ridiculous girl!" &s;aid Emily, "why will you indulge tho&s;e fan|cies? Pray let me hear the end of your &s;tory, I am weary."</P>
<P>Annette &s;till kept her eyes on the lamp, and proceeded in a lower voice. "It was one evening, they &s;ay, at the latter end of the year, it might be about the middle of September, I &s;up|po&s;e, or the beginning of October; nay, for that matter, it might be November, for that, too, is the latter end of the year, but that I cannot &s;ay for certain, becau&s;e they did not tell me for certain them&s;elves. However, it was at the latter end of the year, this grand lady walked out of the ca&s;tle into the woods below, as &s;he had often done before, all alone only her maid was with her. The wind blew cold, and &s;trewed the leaves about, and whi&s;tled di&s;mally among tho&s;e great old che&s;nut trees, that we pa&s;&s;ed, ma'am&s;elle, as we came to the ca&s;tle&mdash;for Benedetto &s;hewed me the trees, as he was talking&mdash;the wind blew cold, and her woman would have per&s;uaded her to return: but all would not do, for &s;he was fond of walking in the woods, at evening time, and if the leaves were falling about her, &s;o much the better.</P>
<P>"Well, they &s;aw her go down among the woods, but night came, and &s;he did not return; ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock came, and no lady! Well, the &s;ervants thought to be &s;ure, &s;ome accident had befallen her, and they went out to &s;eek her. They &s;earched all night long, but could not find her, or any trace of her, and, from that day to this, ma'am&s;elle &s;he has never been heard of."</P>
<P>"Is this true, Annette?" &s;aid Emily in much &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"True, ma'am!" &s;aid Annette, with a look of horror, "yes, it is true, indeed. But they do &s;ay," &s;he added, lowering her voice, "they do &s;ay, that the Signora has been &s;een, &s;everal times &s;ince, walking in the woods and about the ca&s;tle in the night: &s;everal of the old &s;ervants, who remained here &s;ometime

after, declare they &s;aw her; and, &s;ince then, &s;he has been &s;een by &s;ome of the va&s;&s;als, who have happened to be in the ca&s;tle, at night. Carlo, the old &s;teward, could tell &s;uch things, they &s;ay, if he would."</P>
<P>"How contradictory is this, Annette!" &s;aid Emily, "you &s;ay nothing has been &s;ince known of her, and yet &s;he has been &s;een!"</P>
<P>"But all this was told me for a great &s;ecret," rejoined An|nette, without noticing the remark, "and I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, ma'am, you would not hurt either me or Benedetto, &s;o much as to go and tell it again." Emily remained &s;ilent, and Annette repeated her la&s;t &s;entence.</P>
<P>"You have nothing to fear from my indi&s;cretion," replied Emily, "and let me advi&s;e you, my good Annette, be di&s;cree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> your&s;elf, and never mention what you have ju&s;t told me to any other per&s;on. Signor Montoni, as you &s;ay, may be angry if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hears of it. But what inquiries were made concerning the lady."</P>
<P>"O! a great deal, indeed, ma'am&s;elle, for the Signor laid claim to the ca&s;tle directly, as being the next heir, and they &s;aid, that is, the judges or the &s;enators, or &s;omebody of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;aid, he could not take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it till &s;o many years were gone by, and then, if, after all, the lady could not be found, why &s;he would be as good as dead, and the ca&s;tle would be his own; and &s;o it is his own. But the &s;tory went round, and many &s;trange reports were &s;pread &s;o very &s;trange, ma'am&s;elle, that I &s;hall not tell them."</P>
<P>"That is &s;tranger &s;till, Annette," &s;aid Emily, &s;miling, and rou&s;ing her&s;elf from her reverie. "But, when Signora Lauren|tini was afterwards &s;een in the ca&s;tle, did nobody &s;peak to her?"</P>
<P>"Speak&mdash;&s;peak to her!" cried Annette, with a look of ter|ror; "no, to be &s;ure."</P>
<P>"And why not?" rejoined Emily, willing to hear further.</P>
<P>"Holy Mother! &s;peak to a &s;pirit!"</P>
<P>"But what rea&s;on had they to conclude it was a &s;pirit unle&s;s they had approached, and, &s;poken to it?"</P>
<P>"O ma'am&s;elle, I cannot tell. How can you a&s;k &s;uch &s;hock|ing que&s;tions? But nobody ever &s;aw it come in, or go out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the ca&s;tle; and it was in one place now, and then the next mi|nute in quite another part of the ca&s;tle; and then it never &s;pok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and, if it was alive, what &s;hould it do in the ca&s;tle if it never &s;poke?

<P>"What, becau&s;e it never &s;poke?" &s;aid Emily, trying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> laugh away the fears, that began to &s;teal upon her.&mdash;"No
<PB N="21" REF="029378_0124_0FE08144F9F4D290">
ma'am&s;elle, no;" replied Annette, rather angrily, "but becau&s;e &s;omething has been &s;een there. They &s;ay, too, there is an old chapel adjoining the we&s;t &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, where, any time at midnight, you may hear &s;uch groans!&mdash;it makes one &s;hudder to think of them!&mdash;and &s;trange &s;ights have been &s;een there&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Pr'ythee, Annette, no more of the&s;e &s;illy tales," &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Silly tales, ma'am&s;elle! O, but I will tell you one &s;tory about this, if you plea&s;e, that Caterina told me. It was one cold win|ter's night that Caterina (&s;he often came to the ca&s;tle then, &s;he &s;ays, to keep old Carlo and his wife company, and &s;o he recom|mended her afterwards to the Signor, and &s;he lived here ever &s;ince) Caterina was &s;itting with them in the little hall, &s;ays Car|lo, I wi&s;h we had &s;ome of tho&s;e figs to roa&s;t, that lie in the &s;tore clo&s;et, but it is along way off, and I am loath to fetch them; do, Caterina," &s;ays he, "for you are young and nimble, do bring us &s;ome, the fire is in a nice trim for roa&s;ting them; they lie," &s;ays he, "in &s;uch a corner of the &s;toreroom, at the end of the north-gallery; here, take the lamp," &s;ays he, "and mind, as you go up the great &s;tairca&s;e, that the wind, through the roof, does not blow it out." So, with that, Caterina took the lamp&mdash;Hu&s;h! ma'am&s;elle, I &s;urely heard a noi&s;e!"</P>
<P>Emily, whom Annette had now infected with her own ter|rors, li&s;tened attentively; but every thing was &s;till, and Annette proceeded:</P>
<P>"Caterina went to the north gallery, that is the wide gallery we pa&s;&s;ed, ma'am, before we came to the corridor, here. As, &s;he went with the lamp in her hand thinking of nothing at all&mdash;There, again!" cried Annette, &s;uddenly&mdash;"I heard it again!&mdash;it was not fancy, ma'am&s;elle!"</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" &s;aid Emily, trembling. They li&s;tened, and con|tinuing to &s;it quite &s;till, Emily heard a low knocking again&s;t the wall. It came repeatedly. Annette then &s;creamed loudly, and the chamber door &s;lowly opened. It was Caterina, come to tell Annette, that her lady wanted her. Emily, though &s;he now perceived who it was, could not immediately overcome her terror; while Annette, half laughing, half crying, &s;colded Caterina heartily for thus alarming them; and was al&s;o terrified le&s;t what &s;he had told had been overheard. Emily, who&s;e mind was deeply impre&s;&s;ed by the chief circum&s;tance of An|nette's relation, was unwilling to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e left alone, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits; but, to avoid offending Madame Montoni, and betraying her own weakne&s;s, &s;he &s;truggled to overcome the illu&s;ions of fear, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Annette for the night.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="029378_0125_0FE08153D72F8048">
When &s;he was alone, her thoughts recurred to the &s;trange hi&s;tory of Signora Laurentini and then to her own &s;trange &s;itua|tion, in the wild and &s;olitary mountains of a foreign country, in the ca&s;tle, and the power of a man, to whom, only a few pre|ceding months, &s;he was an entire &s;tanger; who had already exerci&s;ed an u&s;urped authority over her, and who&s;e character &s;he now regarded with a degree of terror, apparently ju&s;tified by the fears of others. She knew, that he had invention equal to the conception and talents to the execution of any project, and &s;he greatly feared he had a heart too void of feeling to oppo&s;e the perpetration of whatever his intere&s;t might &s;ugge&s;t. She had long ob&s;erved the unhappine&s;s of Madame Montoni, and had of|ten been witne&s;s to the &s;tern and contemptuous behaviour &s;he received from her hu&s;band. To the&s;e circum&s;tances, which con&s;pired to give her ju&s;t cau&s;e for alarm, were now added tho&s;e thou&s;and namele&s;s terrors, which exi&s;t only in active im|aginations, and which &s;et rea&s;on and examination equally at defiance.</P>
<P>Emily remembered all that Valancourt had told her, on the eve of her departure from Languedoc, re&s;pecting Montoni, and all that he had &s;aid to di&s;&s;uade her from venturing on the journey. His fears had often &s;ince appeared to her prophetic&mdash;now they &s;eemed confirmed. Her heart, as it gave her back the image of Valancourt, mourned in vain regret, but rea&s;on &s;oon came with a con&s;olation, which, though feeble at fir&s;t, acquired vigour from reflection. She con&s;idered, that, whatever might be her &s;uffer|ings, &s;he had withheld from involving him in misfortune, and that, whatever her future &s;orrows could be, &s;he was, at lea&s;t, free from &s;elf reproach.</P>
<P>Her melancholy was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the hollow &s;ighings of the wind along the corridor and round the ca&s;tle. The cheerful blaze of the wood had long been extingui&s;hed, and &s;he &s;at with her eyes fixed on the dying embers, till a loud gu&s;t, that &s;wept through the corridor, and &s;hook the doors and ca&s;ements, alarmed her, for its violence had moved the chair &s;he had placed as a fa&s;ten|ing, and the door, leading to the private &s;tairca&s;e, &s;tood half open. Her curio&s;ity and her fears were again awakened. She took the lamp to the top of the &s;teps, and &s;tood he&s;itating whether to go down; but again the profound &s;tillne&s;s and the gloom of the place awed her, and, determining to inquire further, when day|light might a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;earch, &s;he clo&s;ed the door, and placed again&s;t it a &s;tronger guard.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="029378_0125_0FE08153D72F8048">
She now retired to her bed, leaving the lamp burning on the table; but its gloomy light, in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her fear, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed it; for, by its uncertain rays, &s;he almo&s;t fancied &s;he &s;aw &s;hapes flit pa&s;t her curtains and glide into the remote ob&s;curity of her chamber.

<P>DAYLIGHT di&s;pelled from Emily's mind the glooms of &s;uper&s;tition, but not tho&s;e of apprehen&s;ion. The Count Morano was the fir&s;t image, that occurred to her waking thoughts, and than came a train of anticipated evils, which &s;he could neither conquer, or avoid. She ro&s;e, and, to relieve her mind from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ideas, that tormented it, compelled her&s;elf to notice exter|nal objects. From her ca&s;ement &s;he looked out upon the wild grandeur of the &s;cene, clo&s;ed nearly on all &s;ides by alpine &s;teeps, who&s;e tops, peeping over each other, faded from the eye in mi&s;ty hues, while the promontories below, were dark with woods, that &s;wept down to their ba&s;e, and &s;tretched along the narrow vallies. The rich pomp of the&s;e woods was particularly delightful to Em|ily; and &s;he viewed with a&s;toni&s;hment the fortifications of the ca&s;tle &s;preading along a va&s;t extent of rock, and now partly in decay, the grandeur of the ramparts below, and the towers and battle|ments and various features of the fabric above. From the&s;e her &s;ight wandered over the cliffs and woods into the valley, along which foamed a broad and rapid &s;tream, &s;een falling among the crags of an oppo&s;ite mountain, now fla&s;hing in the &s;unbeams, and now &s;hadowed by overarching pines, till it was entirely concealed by their thick foliage. Again it bur&s;t from beneath this dark|ne&s;s in one broad &s;heet of foam, and fell thundering into the vale. Nearer, towards the we&s;t, opened the mountain vi&s;ta, which Emily had viewed with &s;uch &s;ublime emotion, on her approach to the ca&s;tle: a thin du&s;ky vapour, that ro&s;e from the valley, over&s;pread its features with a &s;weet ob&s;curity. As this a&s;cended and caught the &s;unbeams, it kindled into a crim&s;on tint, and touched with
<PB N="24" REF="029378_0126_0FE0815977FEB398">
exqui&s;ite beauty the woods and cliffs, over which it pa&s;&s;ed to the &s;ummit of the mountains; then, as the veil drew up, it was de|lightful, to watch the gleaming objects, that progre&s;&s;ively di&s;clo|&s;ed them&s;elves in the valley&mdash;the green turf&mdash;dark woods&mdash;little rocky rece&s;&s;es&mdash;a few pea&s;ants' huts&mdash;the foaming &s;tream&mdash;a herd of cattle, and various images of pa&s;toral beauty. Then, the pine fore&s;ts brightened, and then the broad brea&s;t of the mountains, till, at length, the mi&s;t &s;ettled round their &s;ummit, touching them with a ruddy glow. The features of the vi&s;ta now appeared di&s;|tinctly, and the broad deep &s;hadows, that fell from the lower cliffs, gave &s;trong effect to the &s;treaming &s;plendour above; while the mountains, gradually &s;inking in the per&s;pective, appeared to &s;helve into the Adriatic &s;ea, for &s;uch Emily imagined to be the gleam of bluei&s;h light, that terminated the view.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he endeavoured to amu&s;e her fancy, and was not un&s;uc|ce&s;sful. The breezy fre&s;hne&s;s of the morning, too, revived her. She rai&s;ed her thoughts in prayer, which &s;he felt always mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to do, when viewing the &s;ublimity of nature, and her mind recovered its &s;trength.</P>
<P>When &s;he turned from the ca&s;ement, her eyes glanced upon the door &s;he had &s;o carefully guarded, on the preceding night and &s;he now determined to examine whither it led; but, on ad|vancing to remove the chairs, &s;he perceived, that they were al|ready moved a little way. Her &s;urpri&s;e cannot ea&s;ily be imag|ined, when, in the next minute, &s;he perceived that the door was fa&s;tened.&mdash;She felt, as if &s;he had &s;een an apparition. The door of the corridor was locked as &s;he had left it, but this door, which could be &s;ecured only on the out&s;ide, mu&s;t have been bolted, dur|ing the night. She became &s;eriou&s;ly unea&s;y at the thought of &s;leeping again in a chamber, thus liable to intru&s;ion, &s;o remote too, as it was from the family, and &s;he determined to mention the circum&s;tance to Madame Montoni, and to reque&s;t a change.</P>
<P>After &s;ome perplexity &s;he found her way into the great hall and to the room, which &s;he had left, on the preceding night where breakfa&s;t was &s;pread, and her aunt was alone, for Montoni had been walking over the environs of the ca&s;tle, examining the condition of its fortifications, and talking for &s;ometime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Carlo. Emily ob&s;erved, that her aunt had been weeping, and her heart &s;oftened towards her, with an affection, that &s;hewed it|&s;elf in her manner, rather than in words, while &s;he carefully avoided the appearance of having noticed, that &s;he was unhappy. She &s;eized the opportunity of Montoni's ab&s;ence to mention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> circum&s;tance of the door, to reque&s;t that &s;he might be allowed
<PB N="25" REF="029378_0126_0FE0815977FEB398">
another apartment, and to inquire again, concerning the occa&s;ion of their &s;udden journey. On the fir&s;t &s;ubject her aunt referred her to Montoni, po&s;itively refu&s;ing to interfere in the affair; on the la&s;t, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed utter ignorance.</P>
<P>Emily, then, with a wi&s;h of making her aunt more reconciled to her &s;ituation, prai&s;ed the grandeur of the ca&s;tle and the &s;ur|rounding &s;cenery, and endeavoured to &s;often every unplea&s;ing circum&s;tance attending it. But, though misfortune had &s;ome|what conquered the a&s;perities of Madame Montoni's temper, and, by increa&s;ing her cares for her&s;elf, had taught her to feel in &s;ome degree for others, the capricious love of rule, which nature had planted and habit had nouri&s;hed in her heart, was not &s;ubdued. She could not now deny her&s;elf the gratification of tyrannizing over the innocent and helple&s;s Emily, by attempting to ridicule the ta&s;te &s;he could not feel.</P>
<P>Her &s;atirical di&s;cour&s;e was, however, interrupted by the en|trance of Montoni, and her countenance immediately a&s;&s;umed a mingled expre&s;&s;ion of fear and re&s;entment, while he &s;eated him|&s;elf at the breakfa&s;t table, as if uncon&s;cious of there being any per&s;on but him&s;elf in the room.</P>
<P>"Emily, as &s;he ob&s;erved him in &s;ilence, &s;aw that his coun|tenance was darker and &s;terner than u&s;ual. "O could I know," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "what pa&s;&s;es in that mind; could I know the thoughts, that are known there, I &s;hould no longer be con|demned to this torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e!" Their breakfa&s;t pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence, till Emily ventured to reque&s;t, that another apartment might be allotted to her, and related the circum&s;tance which made her wi&s;h it.</P>
<P>"I have no time to attend the&s;e idle whims," &s;aid Monto|ni, "that chamber was prepared for you, and you mu&s;t re&s;t con|tented with it. It is not probable, that any per&s;on would take the trouble of going to that remote &s;tairca&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of fa&s;tening a door. If it was not fa&s;tened, when you entered the chamber, the wind, perhaps, &s;hook the door and made the bolts &s;lide. But I know not why I &s;hould undertake to account for &s;o trifling an occurrence." This explanation was by no means &s;atisfactory to Emily, who had ob&s;erved, that the bolts were ru&s;ted, and con&s;equently could not be thus ea&s;ily moved; but &s;he forbore to &s;ay &s;o, and repeated her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>"If you will not relea&s;e your&s;elf from the &s;lavery of the&s;e fears," &s;aid Montoni, &s;ternly, "at lea&s;t forbear to torment other's by the mention of them. Conquer &s;uch whims, and endeavour to &s;trengthen your mind. No exi&s;tence is more contemptible
<PB N="26" REF="029378_0127_0FE08166C29CB380">
than that, which is embittered by fear." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he &s;aid this, his eye glanced upon Madame Montoni, who coloured highly, but was &s;till &s;ilent. Emily, wounded and di&s;appointed, thought her fears were, in this in&s;tance, too rea&s;onable to de&s;erve ridicule, but, perceiving, that, however, they might oppre&s;s her, &s;he mu&s;t endure them, &s;he tried to withdraw her attention from the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>Carlo &s;oon after entered with &s;ome fruit: "Your <HI>Excellen|za</HI> is tired after your long ramble," &s;aid he, as he &s;et the fruit upon the table; "but you have more to &s;ee after breakfa&s;t. There is a place in the vaulted pa&s;&s;age leading to"&mdash;</P>
<P>Montoni frowned upon him, and waved his hand for him to leave the room. Carlo &s;topped, looked down and then added, as he advanced to the breakfa&s;t table, and took up the ba&s;ket <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fruit, "I made bold, your <HI>Excellenza,</HI> to bring &s;ome cheries, her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for my honoured lady and my young mi&s;tre&s;s. Will your lady|&s;hip ta&s;te them, madam?" &s;aid Carlo, pre&s;enting the ba&s;ket "they are very fine ones, though I gathered them my&s;elf, and from an old tree, that catches all the &s;outh &s;un; they are as big <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plums, your lady&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Very well, old Carlo," &s;aid Madame Montoni: "I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> obliged to you."</P>
<P>"And the young Signora, too, &s;he may like &s;ome of them&punc; rejoined Carlo, turning with the ba&s;ket to Emily, "it will do me good to &s;ee her eat &s;ome."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Carlo," &s;aid Emily taking &s;ome cheries, and &s;miling kindly.</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid Montoni, impatiently, "enough of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Leave the room. But be in waiting, I &s;hall want you pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Carlo obeyed, and Montoni, &s;oon after, went out to examine further into the &s;tate of the ca&s;tle; while Emily remained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her aunt, patiently enduring her ill humour, and endeavouri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> with much &s;weetne&s;s, to &s;ooth her affliction, in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its effect.</P>
<P>When Madame Montoni retired to her dre&s;&s;ing room, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> endeavoured to amu&s;e her&s;elf by a view of the ca&s;tle.

of the country to be &s;een in &s;uch various points of view, that they appeared to form new land&s;capes. She often pau&s;ed to examine the gothic magnificence of Udolpho, its proud irregular|ity, its lofty towers and battlements, its high arched, ca&s;ements, and its &s;lender watch towers, perched upon the corners of turrets. Then &s;he would lean on the wall of the terrace, and, &s;huddering, mea&s;ure with her eye the precipice below, till the dark &s;ummits of the woods arre&s;ted it. Wherever &s;he turned, appeared moun|tain tops, fore&s;ts of pine and narrow glens, opening among the Apennines and retiring from the &s;ight into inacce&s;&s;ible regions.</P>
<P>While &s;he thus leaned, Montoni, followed by two men, ap|peared, a&s;cending a winding path, cut in the rock below. He &s;topped upon a cliff, and, pointing to the ramparts, turned to his followers, and talked with much eagerne&s;s of ge&s;ticulation.&mdash;Emily perceived that one of the&s;e men was Carlo; the other was in the dre&s;s of a pea&s;ant, and he alone &s;eemed to be receiving the directions of Montoni.</P>
<P>She withdrew from the walls, and pur&s;ued her walk, till &s;he heard at a di&s;tance the &s;ound of carriage wheels, and then the loud bell of the portal, when it in&s;tantly occurred to her, that Count Morano was arrived. As &s;he ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed the folding doors from the terrace, towards her own apartment, &s;everal per&s;ons entered the hall, by an oppo&s;ite door. She &s;aw them at the extremity of the arcades, and immediately retreated; but the agitation of her &s;pirits, and the extent and du&s;kine&s;s of the hall, had prevented her from di&s;tingui&s;hing the per&s;on of the &s;trangers. Her fears, how|ever, had but one object, and they had called up that object to her fancy; &s;he believed that &s;he had &s;een Count Morano.</P>
<P>When &s;he thought that they had pa&s;&s;ed the hall, &s;he ventured again to the door, and proceeded, unob&s;erved, to her room, where &s;he remained, agitated with apprehen&s;ions, and li&s;tening to every di&s;tant &s;ound. At length, hearing voices on the rampart &s;he ha&s;|tened to her window, and ob&s;erved Montoni with Signor Cavig|ni, walking below, conver&s;ing earne&s;tly, and often &s;topping and turning towards each other, at which times their di&s;cour&s;e &s;eem|ed to be uncommonly intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Of the &s;everal per&s;ons who had appeared in the hall, here was Cavigni alone: but Emily's alarm was &s;oon after heightened by the &s;teps of &s;ome one in the corridor, who, &s;he apprehended, brought a me&s;&s;age from the Count. In the next moment An|nette appeared.</P>
<P>"Ah! ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, "here is the Signor Cavigni arrived! I am &s;ure I rejoiced to &s;ee a chri&s;tian per&s;on in this

<P>"I cannot gue&s;s, Annette; tell me quickly."</P>
<P>"Nay, ma'am, do gue&s;s once."</P>
<P>"Well, then," &s;aid Emily, with a&s;&s;umed compo&s;ure, "it is&mdash;Count Morano, I &s;uppo&s;e."</P>
<P>"Holy Virgin!" cried Annette, "are you ill, ma'am&s;elle? you are going to faint! let me get &s;ome water."</P>
<P>"Emily &s;unk into a chair; "Stay, Annette," &s;aid &s;he, feebly, "do not leave me&mdash;I &s;hall &s;oon be better; open the ca&s;ement.&mdash;The Count, you &s;ay&mdash;he is come then?"</P>
<P>"Who, I!&mdash;the Count! No, ma'am&s;elle, I did not &s;ay &s;o." "He is not come then?" &s;aid Emily, eagerly. "No, ma'am|&s;elle."</P>

<P>"But the Count&mdash;you are &s;ure, is not come?"</P>
<P>"O yes, quite &s;ure of that, ma'am&s;elle. Why, I was looking out through the grate in the north turret, when the carriage drove into the court yard, and I never expected to &s;ee &s;uch a good &s;ight in this di&s;mal old ca&s;tle! but here are ma&s;ters and &s;ervant too, enough to make the place ring again.

<P>Yes, ma'am&s;elle, I &s;ee you are.

<P><PB N="29" REF="029378_0128_0FE0816C627D9ED0">
"I fear, to thy peril, my good Annette," &s;aid Emily; "for it &s;eems his ver&s;es have &s;tolen thy heart. But let me advi&s;e you; if it is &s;o, keep the &s;ecret; never let him know it."</P>
<P>"Ah&mdash;ma'am&s;elle!&mdash;how can one keep &s;uch a &s;ecret as that?"</P>
<P>"Well, Annette, I am now &s;o much better, that you may leave me."</P>
<P>"O, but, ma'am&s;elle, I forgot to a&s;k&mdash;how did you &s;leep in this dreary old chamber la&s;t night?"&mdash;"As well as u&s;ual."&mdash;"Did you hear no noi&s;es?"&mdash;"None."&mdash;"Nor &s;ee any thing?" "Nothing."&mdash;"Well, that is &s;urpri&s;ing!"&mdash;"Not in the lea&s;t: and now tell me, why you a&s;k the&s;e que&s;tions."</P>
<P>"O, ma'am&s;elle! I would not tell you for the world, nor all I have heard about this chamber, either; it would frighten you &s;o?"</P>
<P>"If that is all, you have frightened me already, and may therefore tell me what you know, without hurting your con&s;cience."</P>
<P>"O Lord! they &s;ay the room is haunted, and has been &s;o the&s;e many years."</P>
<P>"It is by a gho&s;t, then, who can draw bolts," &s;aid Emily, endeavouring to laugh away her apprehen&s;ions; "for I left that door open, la&s;t night, and found it fa&s;tened this morning."</P>
<P>Annette turned pale, and &s;aid not a word.</P>
<P>"Do you know whether any of the &s;ervants fa&s;tened this door in the morning before I ro&s;e?"</P>
<P>"No, ma'am, that I will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound they did not; but I don't know: &s;hall I go and a&s;k ma'am&s;elle?" &s;aid Annette, moving ha&s;tily towards the corridor.</P>
<P>"Stay, Annette, I have other que&s;tions to a&s;k; tell me what you have heard concerning this room, and whither that &s;tairca&s;e leads."</P>
<P>"I will go and a&s;k it all directly, ma'am; be&s;ides I am &s;ure my lady wants me. I cannot &s;tay now, indeed, ma'am."</P>
<P>She hurried from the room, without waiting Emily's reply, who&s;e heart, lightened by the certainty, that Morano was not arrived, allowed her to &s;mile at the &s;uper&s;titious terror, which had &s;eized on Annette; for, though &s;he &s;ometimes felt its influ|ence her&s;elf, &s;he could &s;mile at it, when apparent in other per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Montoni having refu&s;ed Emily another chamber, &s;he determin|ed to bear with patience the evil &s;he could not remove, are, in order to make the room as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible, unpacked her books, her &s;weet delight in happier days, and her &s;oothing re|&s;our&s;e in the hours of moderate &s;orrow: but, there were hours when
<PB N="30" REF="029378_0129_0FE081795947A248">
even the&s;e failed of their effect; when the genius, the ta&s;te, the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the &s;ublime&s;t writers were felt no longer.</P>
<P>Her little library being arranged on a high che&s;t, part of the furniture of the room, &s;he took out her drawing uten&s;ils, and was tranquil enough to be plea&s;ed with the thought of &s;ketching the &s;ublime &s;cenes, beheld from her windows; but &s;he &s;uddenly checked this plea&s;ure, remembering how often &s;he had &s;oothed her&s;elf by the intention of obtaining amu&s;ement of this kind, and had been prevented by &s;ome new circum&s;tance of misfortune.</P>
<P>"How can I &s;uffer my&s;elf to be deluded by hope," &s;aid &s;he, "and, becau&s;e Count Morano is not yet arrived, feel a momentary happine&s;s? Alas! what is it to me, whether he is here to-day, or to-morrow, if he comes at all?&mdash;and that he will come&mdash;it were weakne&s;s to doubt."</P>
<P>To withdraw her thoughts, however, from the &s;ubject of her misfortunes, &s;he attempted to read, but her attention wandered from the page, and, at length, &s;he threw a&s;ide the book, and de|termined to explore the adjoining chambers of the ca&s;tle. Her imagination was plea&s;ed with the view of ancient grandeur, and an emotion of melancholy awe awakened all its powers, as &s;he walked through rooms, ob&s;cure and de&s;olate, where no foot|&s;teps had pa&s;&s;ed probably for many years, and remembered the &s;trange hi&s;tory of the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the edifice. This brought to her recollection the veiled picture, which had attracted her curio&s;ity, on the preceding night, and &s;he re&s;olved to exam|ine it. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through the chambers, that led to this, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;omewhat agitated; its connection with the late lady of the ca&s;tle, and the conver&s;ation of Annette, together with the circum&s;tance of the veil, throwing a my&s;tery over the &s;ubject, that excited a faint degree of terror. But a terror of this nature, as it occupies and expands the mind, and elevates it to high ex|pectation, is purely &s;ublime, and leads us, by a kind of facination, to &s;eek even the object, from which we appear to &s;hrink.</P>
<P>Emily pa&s;&s;ed on with faltering &s;teps, and having pau&s;ed a mo|ment at the door, before &s;he attempted to open it, &s;he then ha&s;tily entered the chamber, and went towards the picture, which ap|peared to be enclo&s;ed in a frame of uncommon &s;ize, that hung in a dark part of the room. She pau&s;ed again, and then with a timid hand, lifted the veil; but in&s;tantly let it fall&mdash;perceiving that what it had concealed was no picture, and, before &s;he could leave the chamber, &s;he dropped &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>When &s;he recovered her recollection, the remembrance of what &s;he had &s;een had nearly deprived her of it a &s;econd time.
<PB N="31" REF="029378_0129_0FE081795947A248">
She had &s;carcely &s;trength to remove from the room, and regain her own; and, when arrived there, wanted courage to remain alone. Horror occupied her mind, and excluded, for a time, all &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t, and dread of future misfortune: &s;he &s;eated her|&s;elf near the ca&s;ement, becau&s;e from thence &s;he heard voices, though di&s;tant, on the terrace, and might &s;ee people pa&s;s, and the&s;e, trifling as they were, were reviving circum&s;tances. When her &s;pirits had recovered their tone, &s;he con&s;idered, whether &s;he &s;hould mention what &s;he had &s;een to Madame Montoni, and va|rious and important motives urged her to do &s;o, among which the lea&s;t was the hope of the relief, which an overburdened mind finds in &s;peaking of the &s;ubject of its intere&s;t. But &s;he was aware of the terrible con&s;equences, which &s;uch a communication might lead to; and, dreading the indi&s;cretion of her aunt, at length, endeavoured to arm her&s;elf with re&s;olution to ob&s;erve a profound &s;ilence, on the &s;ubject. Montoni and Verezzi &s;oon af|ter pa&s;&s;ed under the ca&s;ement, &s;peaking cheerfully, and their voices revived her. Pre&s;ently the Signors Bertolini and Cavigni joined the party on the terrace, and Emily, &s;uppo&s;ing that Mad|ame Montoni was then alone, went to &s;eek her; for the &s;olitude of her chamber, and its proximity to that where &s;he had received &s;o &s;evere a &s;hock, again affected her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>She found her aunt in her dre&s;&s;ing room, preparing for dinner. Emily's pale and affrighted countenance alarmed even Madame Montoni; but &s;he had &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, that &s;till made her &s;hudder, and which was ready to bur&s;t from her lips. In her aunt's apartment &s;he remained, till they both de&s;cended to dinner. There &s;he met the gentlemen lately arrived, who had a kind of bu&s;y &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in their looks, which was &s;omewhat unu&s;ual with them, while their thoughts &s;eemed too much occupied by &s;ome deep intere&s;t, to &s;uffer them to be&s;tow much attention either on Emily, or Madame Montoni. They &s;poke little, and Montoni le&s;s. Emily, as &s;he now looked on him, &s;huddered. The horror of the chamber ru&s;hed on her mind. Several times the colour faded from her cheeks, and &s;he feared, that illne&s;s would betray her emotions, and compel her to leave the room; but the &s;trength of her re&s;olution remedied the weakne&s;s of her frame; &s;he obliged her&s;elf to conver&s;e, and even tried to look cheerful.</P>
<P>Montoni evidently laboured under &s;ome vexation, &s;uch as would probably have agitated a weaker mind, or a more &s;u&s;cep|tible heart, but which appeared, from the &s;ternne&s;s of his coun|tenance, only to bend up his faculties to energy and fortitude.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="029378_0130_0FE0817DE8105518">
It was a comfortle&s;s and &s;ilent meal. The gloom of the ca&s;tle &s;eemed to have &s;pread its contagion even over the gay counte|nance of Cavigni, and with this gloom was mingled a fiercene&s;s, &s;uch as &s;he had &s;eldom &s;een him indicate. Count Morano was not named, and what conver&s;ation there was, turned chiefly upon the wars, which at that time agitated the Italian &s;tates, the &s;trength of the Venetian armies, and the characters of their generals.</P>
<P>After dinner, when the &s;ervants had withdrawn, Emily learn|ed, that the cavalier who had drawn upon him&s;elf the vengeance of Or&s;ino, had &s;ince died of his wounds, and that &s;trict &s;earch was &s;till making for his murderer. The intelligence &s;eemed to di&s;turb Montoni, who mu&s;ed, and then inquired, where Or&s;ino had concealed him&s;elf. His gue&s;ts, who all, except Cavigni, were ignorant, that Montoni had him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to e&s;cape from Venice, replied, that he had fled in the night with &s;uch precipitation and &s;ecrecy, that his mo&s;t intimate companions knew not whither. Montoni blamed him&s;elf for having a&s;ked the que&s;tion, for a &s;econd thought convinced him, that a man of Or&s;ino's &s;u&s;picious temper was not likely to tru&s;t any of the per|&s;ons pre&s;ent with the knowledge of his a&s;ylum. He con&s;idered him&s;elf, however, as entitled to his utmo&s;t confidence, and did not doubt, that he &s;hould &s;oon hear of him.</P>
<P>Emily retired with Madame Montoni, &s;oon after the cloth was withdrawn, and left the cavaliers to their &s;ecret councils, but not before the &s;ignificant frowns of Montoni had warned his wife to depart, who pa&s;&s;ed from the hall to the ramparts, and walked, for &s;ometime, in &s;ilence, which Emily did not interrupt, for her mind was al&s;o occupied by intere&s;ts of its own. It required all her re&s;olution, to forbear communicating to Madame Montoni the terrible &s;ubject, which &s;till thrilled her every nerve with hor|ror; and &s;ometimes &s;he was on the point of doing &s;o, merely to obtain the relief of a moment; but &s;he knew how wholly &s;he was in the power of Montoni, and, con&s;idering, that the indi&s;|cretion of her aunt, might prove fatal to them both, &s;he com|pelled her&s;elf to endure a pre&s;ent and an inferior evil, rather than to tempt a future and a heavier one. A &s;trange kind of pre&s;en|timent frequently, on this day occurred to her;&mdash;it &s;eemed as if her fate re&s;ted here, and was by &s;ome invi&s;ible means connected with this ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"Let me not accelerate it," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf: "for what|ever I may be re&s;erved, let me, at lea&s;t avoid &s;elf reproach."</P>
<P>As &s;he looked on the ma&s;&s;y walls of the edifice, her melancho|ly &s;pirits repre&s;ented it to be her pri&s;on; and &s;he &s;tarted as at a
<PB N="33" REF="029378_0130_0FE0817DE8105518">
new &s;ugge&s;tion, when &s;he con&s;idered how far di&s;tant &s;he was from her native country, from her little peaceful home, and from her only friend&mdash;how remote was her hope of happine&s;s, how feeble the expectation of again &s;eeing him! Yet the idea of Va|lancourt, and her confidence in his faithful love, had hitherto been her only &s;olace, and &s;he &s;truggled hard to retain them. A few tears of agony &s;tarted to her eyes, which &s;he turned a&s;ide to conceal.</P>
<P>While &s;he afterwards leaned on the wall of the rampart, &s;ome pea&s;ants, at a little di&s;tance, were &s;een examining a breach, before which lay a heap of &s;tones, as if to repair it, and a ru&s;ty old can|non that appeared to have fallen from its &s;tation above. Madame Montoni &s;topped to &s;peak to the men, and inquired what they were going to do. "To repair the fortifications, your lady|&s;hip," &s;aid one of them; a labour which &s;he was &s;omewhat &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that Montoni &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary, particularly &s;ince he had never &s;poken of the ca&s;tle as of a place, at which he meant to re&s;ide for any con&s;iderable time; but &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on towards a lofty, arch, that led from the &s;outh to the ea&s;t rampart, and which adjoined the ca&s;tle, on one &s;ide, while, on the other, it &s;upported a &s;mall watch-tower, that entirely commanded the deep valley below. As &s;he approached this arch, &s;he &s;aw, beyond it, wind|ing along the woody de&s;cent of a di&s;tant mountain, a long troop of hor&s;e and foot, whom &s;he knew to be &s;oldiers, only by the glit|ter of their pikes and other arms, for the di&s;tance did not allow her to to di&s;cover the colour of their liveries. As &s;he gazed, the vanguard i&s;&s;ued from the woods into the valley, but the train &s;till continued to pour over the remote &s;ummit of the mountain, in endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; while, in the front, the mil|itary uniform became di&s;tingui&s;hable, and the commanders, riding fir&s;t, and &s;eeming, by their ge&s;tures, to direct the march of tho&s;e that followed, at length, approached very near to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Such a &s;pectacle, in the&s;e &s;olitary regions, both &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed Madame Montoni, and &s;he ha&s;tened towards &s;ome pea|&s;ants, who were employed in rai&s;ing ba&s;tions before the &s;outh rampart, where the rock was le&s;s abrupt than el&s;ewhere. The&s;e men could give no &s;atisfactory an&s;wers to her inquiries, but, be|ing rou&s;ed by them, gazed in &s;tupid a&s;toni&s;hment upon the long cavalcade. Madame Montoni then thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to com|municate farther the &s;ubject of her alarm, &s;ent Emily to &s;ay, that &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to Montoni; an errand her niece did not approve, for &s;he dreaded his frowns, which &s;he knew this me&s;&s;age would provoke; but &s;he obeyed in &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="029378_0131_0FE0818ADAA10058">
As &s;he drew near the apartment, in which he &s;at with his gue&s;ts, &s;he heard them in earne&s;t and loud di&s;pute, and &s;he pau&s;ed a moment, trembling at the di&s;plea&s;ure, which her &s;udden inter|ruption would occa&s;ion. In the next, their voices &s;unk alto|gether; &s;he then ventured to open the door, and, while Montoni turned ha&s;tily and looked at her, without &s;peaking, &s;he delivered her me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>"Tell Madam Montoni I am engaged," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Emily then thought it proper to mention the &s;ubject of her alarm. Montoni and his companions ro&s;e in&s;tantly and went to the windows, but, the&s;e not affording them a view of the troops, they at length proceeded to the ramparts, where Cavigni conjec|tured it to be a legion of <HI>Condottieri,</HI> on their march towards Modena.</P>
<P>One part of the cavalcade now extended along the valley, and another wound among the mountains towards the north, while &s;ome troops &s;till lingered on the woody precipices, where the fir&s;t had appeared, &s;o that the great length of the proce&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to include an whole army. While Montoni and his family watch|ed its progre&s;s, they heard the &s;ound of trumpets and the cla&s;h of cymbals in the vale, and then others, an&s;wering from the heights. Emily li&s;tened with emotion to the &s;hrill bla&s;t, that woke the echoes of the mountains, and Montoni explained the &s;ignals, with which he appeared to be well acquainted, and which meant noth|ing ho&s;tile. The uniforms of the troops, and the kind of arms they bore, confirmed to him the conjecture of Cavigni, and he had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee them pa&s;s by, without even &s;topping to gaze upon his ca&s;tle. He did not, however, leave the rampart, till the ba&s;es of the mountains had &s;hut them from his view, and the la&s;t murmur of the trumpet floated away on the wind. Cavigni and Verezzi were in&s;pirited by this &s;pectacle, which &s;eem|ed to have rou&s;ed all the fire of their temper; Montoni turned into the ca&s;tle in thoughtful &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Emily's mind had not yet &s;ufficiently recovered from its late &s;hock, to endure the loneline&s;s of her chamber, and &s;he remained upon the ramparts; for Madame Montoni had not invited her to her dre&s;&s;ing room, whither &s;he had gone evidently in low &s;pirits, and Emily, from her late experience, had lo&s;t all wi&s;h to explore the gloomy and my&s;terious rece&s;&s;es of the ca&s;tle. The ramparts, therefore, were almo&s;t her only retreat, and here &s;he lingered, till the gray haze of evening was again &s;pread over the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The cavaliers &s;upped by them&s;elves, and Madame Montoni re|mained in her apartment, whither Emily went, before &s;he retired
<PB N="35" REF="029378_0131_0FE0818ADAA10058">
to her own. She found her aunt weeping, and in much agitation. The tenderne&s;s of Emily was naturally &s;o &s;oothing, that it &s;eldom failed to give comfort to the drooping heart: but Madame Mon|toni's was torn, and the &s;ofte&s;t accents of Emily's voice were lo&s;t upon it. With her u&s;ual delicacy, &s;he did not appear to ob&s;erve her aunt's di&s;tre&s;s, but it gave an involuntary gentlene&s;s to her manners, and an air of &s;olicitude to her countenance, which Ma|dame Montoni was vexed to perceive, who &s;eemed to feel the pity of her niece to be an in&s;ult to her pride, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her as &s;oon as &s;he properly could. Emily did not venture to men|tion again the reluctance &s;he felt to her gloomy chamber, but &s;he reque&s;ted that Annette might be permitted to remain with her till &s;he retired to re&s;t; and the reque&s;t was &s;omewhat reluctantly granted. Annette, however, was now with the &s;ervants, and Emily withdrew alone.</P>
<P>With light and ha&s;ty &s;teps &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through the long galleries, while the feeble glimmer of the lamp &s;he carried only &s;hewed the gloom around her, and the pa&s;&s;ing air threatened to extingui&s;h it. The lonely &s;ilence, that reigned in this part of the ca&s;tle, awed her; now and then, indeed, &s;he heard a faint peal of laugh|ter ri&s;e from a remote part of the edifice, where the &s;ervants were a&s;&s;embled, but it was &s;oon lo&s;t, and a kind of breathle&s;s &s;tillne&s;s remained. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;uite of rooms which &s;he had vi&s;it|ed in the morning, her eyes glanced fearfully on the door, and &s;he almo&s;t fancied &s;he heard murmuring &s;ounds within, but &s;he pau&s;ed not a moment to inquire.</P>
<P>Having reached her own apartment, where no blazing wood on the hearth di&s;&s;ipated the gloom, &s;he &s;at down with a book, to enliven her attention, till Annette &s;huold come, and a fire could be kindled. She continued to read till her light was nearly expired, but An|nette did not appear, and the &s;olitude and ob&s;curity of her cham|ber again affected her &s;pirits, the more, becau&s;e of its nearne&s;s to the &s;cene of horror, that &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed in the morning. Gloomy and fanta&s;tic images came to her mind. She looked fearfully towards the door of the &s;tairca&s;e, and then, examining whether it was &s;till fa&s;tened, found that it was &s;o. Unable to conquer the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he felt at the pro&s;pect of &s;leeping again in this remote and in&s;ecure apartment, which &s;ome per&s;on &s;eemed to have entered during the preceding night, her impatience to &s;ee Annette, whom &s;he had bidden to inquire concerning this cir|cum&s;tance, became extremely painful. She wi&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to que&s;|tion her, as to the object, which had excited &s;o much horror in her own mind, and which Annette on the preceding evening had appeared to be in part acquainted with, though her words were
<PB N="36" REF="029378_0132_0FE081908B2F0980">
very remote from the truth, and it appeared plainly to Emily, that the girl had been purpo&s;ely mi&s;led by a fal&s;e report: above all &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed, that the door of the chamber, which con|tained it, &s;hould be left unguarded. Such an in&s;tance of negli|gence almo&s;t &s;urpa&s;&s;ed belief. But her light was now expiring; the faint fla&s;hes it threw upon the walls called up all the terrors of fancy, and &s;he ro&s;e to find her way to the habitable part of the ca&s;tle, before it was quite extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>As &s;he opened the chamber door, &s;he heard remote voices, and, &s;oon after, &s;aw a light i&s;&s;ue upon the further end of the corridor, which Annette and another &s;ervant approached. "I am glad you are come," &s;aid Emily: "what has detained you &s;o long? Pray light me a fire immediately."</P>
<P>"My lady wanted me, ma'am&s;elle," replied Annette in &s;ome confu&s;ion; "I will go and get the wood."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Caterina, "that is my bu&s;ine&s;s," and left the room in&s;tantly, while Annette would have followed; but, being called back, &s;he began to talk very loud, and, laugh, and &s;eem|ed afraid to tru&s;t a pau&s;e of &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Caterina &s;oon returned with the wood, and then, when the cheerful blaze once more animated the room, and this &s;ervant had withdrawn, Emily a&s;ked Annette, whether &s;he had made the inquiry &s;he bade her. "Yes, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "but not a &s;oul knows any thing about the matter: and old Carlo,&mdash;I watched him well, for they &s;ay he knows &s;trange things&mdash;old Carlo looked &s;o as I don't know how to tell, and he a&s;ked me again and again, if I was &s;ure the door was ever unfa&s;tened. Lord, &s;ays I&mdash;am I &s;ure I am alive? And as for me, ma'am I am all a&s;tounded, as one may &s;ay, and would no more &s;leep in this chamber, than I would on the great cannon at the end of the ea&s;t rampart." "And what objection have you to that cannon; more than to any of the re&s;t?" &s;aid Emily &s;miling: "the be&s;t would be rather a hard bed."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am&s;elle, any of them would be hard enough for that matter; but they do &s;ay, that &s;omething has been &s;een in the dead of night, &s;tanding be&s;ide the great cannon as if to guard it."</P>
<P>"Well! my good Annette, the people who tell &s;uch &s;tories, are happy in having you for an auditor, for I perceive you be|lieve them all."</P>
<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle! I will &s;hew you the very cannon; you can &s;ee it from the&s;e windows!"</P>
<P>"Well" &s;aid Emily, "but that does not prove, that an ap|parition guards it."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="029378_0132_0FE081908B2F0980">
"What! not if I &s;hew you the very cannon! Dear ma'am, you will believe nothing."</P>
<P>"Nothing probably upon this &s;ubject, but what I &s;ee," &s;aid Emily.&mdash;"Well, ma'am, but you &s;hall &s;ee it, if you will only &s;tep this way to the ca&s;ement."&mdash;Emily could not forbear laugh|ing, and Annette looked &s;urpri&s;ed. Perceiving her extreme ap|titude to credit the marvellous, Emily forbore to mention the &s;ub|ject &s;he had intended, le&s;t it &s;hould overcome her with ideal terrors, and &s;he began to &s;peak on a lively topic&mdash;the regattas of Venice.</P>
<P>"Aye, ma'am&s;elle, tho&s;e rowing matches," &s;aid Annette, and the fine moonlight nights, are all, that are worth &s;eeing in Venice. To be &s;ure that moon is brighter than any I ever &s;aw; and then to hear &s;uch &s;weet mu&s;ic, too, as Ludovico has often and often &s;ong under the lattice by the we&s;t portico! Ma'am|&s;elle, it was Ludovico, that told me about that picture, which you wanted &s;o to look at la&s;t night, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What picture?" &s;aid Emily, wi&s;hing Annette to explain her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"O! that terrible picture with the black veil over it."</P>
<P>"You never &s;aw it, then?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Who, I!&mdash;No, ma'am&s;elle, I never did. But this morn|ing," continued Annette, lowering her voice, and looking round the room, "this morning, as it was broad daylight, do you know, ma'am, I took a &s;trange fancy to &s;ee it, as I had heard &s;uch odd hints about it, and I got as far as the door, and &s;hould have opened it, if it had not been locked!"</P>
<P>Emily endeavouring to conceal the emotion this circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned, inquired at what hour &s;he went to the chamber, and found, that it was &s;oon after her&s;elf had been there. She al&s;o a&s;ked further que&s;tions, and the an&s;wers convinced her, that An|nette, and probably her informer, were ignorant of the terrible truth, though in Annette's account &s;omething very like the truth, now and then, mingled with the fal&s;ehood. Emily now began to fear, that her vi&s;it to the chamber had been ob&s;erved, &s;ince the door had been clo&s;ed, &s;o immediately after her departure; and dreaded le&s;t this &s;hould draw upon her the vengeance of Monto|ni. Her anxiety, al&s;o was excited, to know whence, and for what purpo&s;e, the delu&s;ive report, which had been impo&s;ed upon Annette, had originated, &s;ince Montoni could only have wi&s;hed for &s;ilence and &s;ecrecy; but &s;he felt, that the &s;ubject was too ter|rible for this lonely hour, and &s;he compelled her&s;elf to leave it, to conver&s;e with Annette, who&s;e chat, &s;imple as it was, &s;he pre|ferred to the &s;tillne&s;s of total &s;olitude.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029378_0133_0FE0819DC2043C40">
Thus they &s;at, till near midnight, but not without many hints from Annette, that &s;he wi&s;hed to go. The embers were now nearly burnt out; and Emily heard, at a di&s;tance, the thunder|ing &s;ound of the hall doors, as they were &s;hut for the night. She, therefore, prepared for re&s;t, but was &s;till unwilling that Annette &s;hould leave her. At this in&s;tant, the great bell of the portal &s;ounded. They li&s;tened in fearful expectation, when, after a long pau&s;e of &s;ilence, it &s;ounded again. Soon after, they heard the noi&s;e of carriage wheels in the court yard. Emily &s;unk al|mo&s;t lifele&s;s in her chair; "It is the Count," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"What, at this time of night, ma'am!" &s;aid Annette: "no, my dear lady. But, for that matter, it is a &s;trange time of night for any body to come!"</P>
<P>"Nay, pr'ythee, good Annette, &s;tay not talking," &s;aid Emi|ly in a voice of agony&mdash;"Go, pr'ythee, go, and &s;ee who it is."</P>
<P>Annette left the room, and carried with her the light, leaving Emily in darkne&s;s, which a few moments before would have ter|rified her in this room, but was now &s;carcely ob&s;erved by her. She li&s;tened and waited, in breathle&s;s expectation, and heard di&s;tant noi&s;es, but Annette did not return. Her patience, at length, exhau&s;ted, &s;he tried to find her way to the corridor, but it was long before &s;he could touch the door of the chamber, and&punc; when &s;he had opened it, the total darkne&s;s without made her fear to proceed. Voices were now heard, and Emily even thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e of Count Morano, and Montoni. Soon after, &s;he heard &s;teps approaching, and then a ray of light &s;tream|ed through the darkne&s;s, and Annette appeared, whom Emily went to meet.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, "you was right, it is the Count &s;ure enough."</P>
<P>"It is he!" exclaimed Emily, lifting her eyes towards heaven and &s;upporting her&s;elf by Annette's arm.</P>
<P>"Good Lord! my dear lady, don't be in &s;uch a <HI>flu&s;ter,</HI> and look &s;o pale, we &s;hall &s;oon hear more."</P>
<P>"We &s;hall, indeed!" &s;aid Emily, moving as fa&s;t as &s;he was able towards her apartment. "I am not well; give me air."&mdash;Annette opened a ca&s;ement, and brought water. The faintne&s;s &s;oon left Emily, but &s;he de&s;ired Annette would not go till &s;he heard from Montoni.</P>
<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle! he &s;urely will not di&s;turb you at this time of night; why, he mu&s;t think you are a&s;leep."</P>
<P>"Stay with me till I am &s;o, then," &s;aid Emily, who felt tem|porary relief from this &s;ugge&s;tion, which appeared probable
<PB N="39" REF="029378_0133_0FE0819DC2043C40">
enough, though her fears had prevented its occurring to her. Annette, with &s;ecret reluctance, con&s;ented to &s;tay, and Emily was now compo&s;ed enough to a&s;k her &s;ome que&s;tions; among others, whether &s;he had &s;een the Count.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am, I &s;aw him alight, for I went from hence to the grate in the north turret, that overlooks the inner court yard, you know. There I &s;aw the Count's carriage, and the Count in it, waiting at the great door,&mdash;for the porter was ju&s;t gone to bed&mdash;with &s;everal men on hor&s;eback all by the light of the torches they carried."&mdash;Emily was compelled to &s;mile. "When the door was opened, the Count &s;aid &s;omething that I could not make out, and then got out, and another gentleman with him. I thought, to be &s;ure, the Signor was gone to bed, and I ha&s;tened away to my lady's dre&s;&s;ing room, to &s;ee what I could hear. But in the way I met Ludovico, and he told me that the Signor was up, coun&s;elling with his ma&s;ter and the other Signors, in the room at the end of the north gallery; and Ludovico held up his finger, and laid it on his lips, as much as to &s;ay&mdash;There is more go|ing on, than you think of, Annette, but you mu&s;t hold your tongue. And &s;o I did hold my tongue, ma'am&s;elle, and came away to tell you directly."</P>
<P>Emily inquired who the cavalier was, that accompanied the Count, and how Montoni received them; but Annette could not inform her.</P>
<P>"Ludovico," &s;he added, "has ju&s;t been to call Signor Montoni's valet, that he might tell him they were arrived, when I met him."</P>
<P>Emily &s;at mu&s;ing, for &s;ometime, and then her anxiety was &s;o much increa&s;ed, that &s;he de&s;ired Annette would go to the &s;er|vants' hall, where it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might hear &s;omething of the Count's intention, re&s;pecting his &s;tay at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am," &s;aid Annette with readine&s;s; "but how am I to find the way, if I leave the lamp with you?"</P>
<P>Emily &s;aid &s;he would light her, and they immediately quitted the chamber. When they had reached the top of the great &s;tairca&s;e, Emily recollected, that &s;he might be &s;een by the Count, and, to avoid the great hall, Annette conducted her through &s;ome private pa&s;&s;ages to a back &s;tairca&s;e, which led directly to that of the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>As &s;he returned towards her chamber, Emily began to fear, that &s;he might again lo&s;e her&s;elf in the intricacies of the ca&s;tle, and again be &s;hocked by &s;ome my&s;terious &s;pectacle; and, though &s;he was already perplexed by the numerous turnings, &s;he feared
<PB N="40" REF="029378_0134_0FE081A28B28C408">
to open one of the many doors, that offered. While &s;he &s;tepped thoughtfully along, &s;he fancied, that &s;he heard a low moaning at no great di&s;tance, and, having pau&s;ed a moment, &s;he heard it again and di&s;tinctly. Several doors appeared on the right hand of the pa&s;&s;age. She advanced, and li&s;tened. When &s;he came to the &s;econd, &s;he heard a voice, apparently in complaint, within, to which &s;he continued to li&s;ten, afraid to open the door, and un|willing to leave it. Convul&s;ive &s;obs followed, and then the piercing accents of an agonizing &s;pirit bur&s;t forth. Emily &s;tood appalled, and looked through the gloom that &s;urrounded her, in fearful expectation. The lamentations continued. Pity now be|gan to &s;ubdue terror; it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might admini&s;ter comfort to the &s;ufferer, at lea&s;t by expre&s;&s;ing &s;ympathy, and &s;he laid her hand on the door. While &s;he he&s;itated &s;he thought &s;he knew this voice, di&s;gui&s;ed as it was by tones of grief. Having, therefore, &s;et down the lamp in the pa&s;&s;age, &s;he gently opened the door, within which all was dark, except that from an inner apartment a partial light ap|peared; and &s;he &s;tepped &s;oftly on. Before &s;he reached it, the ap|pearance of Madame Montoni, leaning on her dre&s;&s;ing table, weep|ing, and with a handkerchief held to her eyes, &s;truck her, and &s;he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some per&s;on was &s;eated in a chair by the fire, but who it was &s;he could not di&s;tingui&s;h. He &s;poke, now and then, in a low voice, that did not allow Emily to hear what was uttered, but &s;he thought, that Madame Montoni, at tho&s;e times, wept the more, who was too much occupied by her own di&s;tre&s;s, to ob|&s;erve Emily, while the latter, though anxious to know what oc|ca&s;ioned this, and who was the per&s;on admitted at &s;o late an hour to her aunt's dre&s;&s;ing room, forbore to add to her &s;uffer|ings by &s;urpri&s;ing her, or to take advantage of her &s;ituation, by li&s;tening to a private di&s;cour&s;e. She, therefore, &s;tepped &s;oftly back, and, after, &s;ome further difficulty, found the way to her own chamber, where nearer intere&s;ts, at length, excluded the &s;ur|pri&s;e and concern &s;he had felt, re&s;pecting Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>Annette, however, returned without &s;atisfactory intelligence, for the &s;ervants, among whom &s;he had been, were either entirely ignorant, or affected to be &s;o, concerning the Count's intended &s;tay at the ca&s;tle. They could talk only of the &s;teep and broken road they had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and of the numerous dangers they had e&s;caped, and expre&s;s wonder how their lord could choo&s;e to en|counter all the&s;e in the darkne&s;s of night; for they &s;carcely al|lowed, that the torches had &s;erved for any other purpo&s;e but that of &s;hewing the drearine&s;s of the mountains. Annette, finding
<PB N="41" REF="029378_0134_0FE081A28B28C408">
&s;he could gain no information, left them, making noi&s;y petitions, for more wood on the fire and more &s;upper on the table.</P>
<P>"And now, ma'am&s;elle," added &s;he, "I am &s;o &s;leepy!&mdash;I am &s;ure, if you was &s;o &s;leepy, you would not de&s;ire me to &s;it up with you."</P>
<P>Emily, indeed, began to think it was cruel to wi&s;h it; &s;he had al&s;o waited &s;o long, without receiving a &s;ummons from Montoni, that it appeared he did not mean to di&s;turb her, at this late hour, and &s;he determined to di&s;mi&s;s Annette. But, when &s;he again looked round her gloomy chamber, and recollected cer|tain circum&s;tances, fear &s;eized her &s;pirits and &s;he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>"And yet it were cruel of me to a&s;k you to &s;tay, till I am a&s;leep, Annette," &s;aid &s;he, "for I fear it will be very long be|fore I forget my&s;elf in &s;leep."</P>
<P>"I dare &s;ay it will be very long, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette.</P>
<P>"But, before you go," rejoined Emily, "let me a&s;k you&mdash;Had Signor Montoni left Count Morano, when you quitted the hall?"</P>
<P>"O no, ma'am, they were alone together."</P>
<P>"Have you been in my aunt's dre&s;&s;ing room, &s;ince you left me?"</P>
<P>"No ma'am&s;elle, I called at the door as I pa&s;&s;ed, but it was fa&s;tened; &s;o I thought my lady was gone to bed."</P>
<P>"Who, then, was with your lady ju&s;t now?" &s;aid Emily, for|getting in &s;urpri&s;e, her u&s;ual prudence.</P>
<P>"Nobody, I believe, ma'am," replied Annette, "nobody has been with her, I believe, &s;ince I left you."</P>
<P>Emily took no further notice of the &s;ubject, and, after &s;ome &s;truggle with imaginary fears, her good nature prevailed over them &s;o far, that &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Annette for the night. She then &s;at, mu&s;ing upon her own circum&s;tances and tho&s;e of Madame Montoni, till her eye re&s;ted on the miniature picture, which &s;he had found, after her father's death, among the papers he had enjoin|ed her to de&s;troy. It was open upon the table, before her, among &s;ome loo&s;e drawings, having, with them, been taken out of a little box by Emily, &s;ome hours before. The &s;ight of it called up many intere&s;ting reflections, but the melancholy &s;weetne&s;s of the coun|tenance &s;oothed the emotions, which the&s;e had occa&s;ioned. It was the &s;ame &s;tyle of countenance as that of her late father, and, while &s;he gazed on it with fondne&s;s on this account, &s;he even fancied a re&s;emblance in the features. But this tranquillity was &s;uddenly interrupted, when &s;he recollected the words in the man|u&s;cript, that had been found with this picture, and which had
<PB N="42" REF="029378_0135_0FE081AF9636F360">
formerly occa&s;ioned her &s;o much doubt and horror. At length, &s;he rou&s;ed her&s;elf from the deep reverie, into which this remem|brance had thrown her; but, when &s;he ro&s;e to undre&s;s, the &s;ilence and &s;olitude, to which &s;he was left, at this midnight hour, for not even a di&s;tant &s;ound was now heard, con&s;pired with the im|pre&s;&s;ion the &s;ubject &s;he had been con&s;idering had given to her mind, to appall her. Annette's hints, too, concerning this cham|ber, &s;imple as they were, had not failed to affect her, &s;ince they followed a circum&s;tance of peculiar horror, which &s;he her&s;elf had witne&s;&s;ed, and &s;ince the &s;cene of this was a chamber nearly ad|joining her own.</P>
<P>The door of the &s;tairca&s;e, was, perhaps, a &s;ubject of more rea&s;onable alarm, and &s;he now began to apprehend, &s;uch was the aptitude of her fears, that this &s;tairca&s;e had &s;ome private com|munication with the apartment, which &s;he &s;huddered even to re|member. Determined not to undre&s;s, &s;he lay down to &s;leep in her clothes, with her late father's dog, the faithful <HI>Manchon,</HI> at the foot of the bed, whom &s;he con&s;idered as a kind of guard.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, &s;he tried to bani&s;h reflection, but her bu&s;y fancy would &s;till hover over the &s;ubjects of her intere&s;t, and &s;he heard the clock of the ca&s;tle &s;trike two, before &s;he clo&s;ed her eyes.</P>
<P>From the di&s;turbed &s;lumber, into which &s;he then &s;unk, &s;he was &s;oon awakened by a noi&s;e, which &s;eemed to ari&s;e within her chamber; but the &s;ilence, that prevailed, as &s;he fearfully li&s;tened, inclined her to believe, that &s;he had been alarmed by &s;uch &s;ounds as &s;ometimes occur in dreams, and &s;he laid her head again upon the pillow.</P>
<P>A return of the noi&s;e again di&s;turbed her; it &s;eemed to come from that part of the room, which communicated with the pri|vate &s;tairca&s;e, and &s;he in&s;tantly remembered the odd circum&s;tance of the door having been fa&s;tened, during the preceding night, by &s;ome unknown hand. Her late alarming &s;u&s;picion, concerning its communication, al&s;o occurred to her. Her heart became faint with terror. Half rai&s;ing her&s;elf from the bed, and gently drawing a&s;ide the curtain, &s;he looked towards the door of the &s;tairca&s;e, but the lamp, that burnt on the hearth, &s;pread &s;o feeble a light through the apartment, that the remote parts of it were lo&s;t in &s;hadow. The noi&s;e, however, which, &s;he was convinced, came from the door, continued. It &s;eemed like that made by the undrawing of ru&s;ty bolts, and often cea&s;ed, and was then re|newed more gently, as if the hand, that occa&s;ioned it, was re|&s;trained by a fear of di&s;covery. While Emily kept her eyes

fixed on the &s;pot, &s;he &s;aw the door move, and then &s;lowly open, and perceived &s;omething enter the room, but the extreme du&s;ki|ne&s;s prevented her di&s;tingui&s;hing what it was. Almo&s;t fainting with terror, &s;he had yet &s;ufficient command over her&s;elf, to check the &s;hriek, that was e&s;caping from her lips, and letting the curtain drop from her hand, continued to ob&s;erve in &s;ilence the motions of the my&s;terious form &s;he &s;aw. It &s;eemed to glide along the remote ob&s;curity of the apartment, then pau&s;ed, and, as it approached the hearth, &s;he perceived, in the &s;tronger light, what appeared to be a human figure. Certain remembrances now &s;truck upon her heart, and almo&s;t &s;ubdued the feeble re|mains of her &s;pirits; &s;he continued, however, to watch the figure, which remained for &s;ometime motionle&s;s, but then, advancing &s;lowly towards the bed, &s;tood &s;ilently at the feet, where the cur|tains, being a little open, allowed her &s;till to &s;ee it; terror, however, had now deprived her of the power of di&s;crimination, as well as that of utterance.</P>
<P>Having continued there a moment, the form retreated towards the hearth, when it took the lamp, held it up, &s;urveyed the chamber, for a few moments, and then again advanced towards the bed. The light at that in&s;tant awakening the dog, that had &s;lept at Emily's feet, he barked loudly, and, jumping to the floor, flew at the &s;tranger, who &s;truck the animal &s;martly with a &s;heathed &s;word, and, &s;pringing towards the bed, Emily di&s;cov|ered&mdash;Count Morano!</P>
<P>She gazed at him for a moment in &s;peechle&s;s affright, while he, throwing him&s;elf on his knee at the bed &s;ide, be&s;ought her to fear nothing, and, having thrown down his &s;word, would have taken her hand, when the faculties, that terror had &s;u&s;pended, &s;ud|denly returned, and &s;he &s;prung from the bed, in the dre&s;s, which &s;urely a kind of prophetic apprehen&s;ion had prevented her, on this night, from throwing a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Morano ro&s;e, followed her to the door, through which he had entered, and caught her hand, as &s;he reached the top of the &s;tair|ca&s;e, but not before &s;he had di&s;covered, by the gleam of a lamp, another man half way down the &s;teps. She now &s;creamed in de&s;pair, and, believing her&s;elf given up by Montoni, &s;aw, indeed, no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The Count, who &s;till held her hand, led her back into the chamber.</P>
<P>"Why all this terror?" &s;aid he, in a tremulous voice.&mdash;"Hear me, Emily: I come not to alarm you; no, by Heaven! I love you too well&mdash;too well for my own peace."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="029378_0136_0FE081B46B2359A8">
Emily looked at him for a moment, in fearful doubt.</P>
<P>"Then leave me &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "leave me in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>"Hear me, Emily," re&s;umed Morano; "hear me! I love, and am in de&s;pair&mdash;yes&mdash;in de&s;pair. How can I gaze upon you, and know, that it is, perhaps, for the la&s;t time, without &s;uffering all the phren&s;y of de&s;pair? But it &s;hall not be &s;o; you &s;hall be mine, in &s;pite of Montoni and all his villainy."</P>
<P>"In &s;pite of Montoni!" cried Emily eagerly: "what is it I hear?"</P>
<P>"You hear, that Montoni is a villain," exclaimed Morano with vehemence,&mdash;"a villain who would have &s;old you to my love!&mdash;Who&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And is he le&s;s who would have bought me?" &s;aid Emily, fixing on the Count an eye of calm contempt. "Leave the room, &s;ir, in&s;tantly," &s;he continued in a voice, trembling between joy and fear, "or I will alarm the family, and you may receive that from Signor Montoni's vengeance, which I have vainly &s;up|plicated from his pity." But Emily knew, that &s;he was beyond the hearing of tho&s;e, who might protect her.</P>
<P>"You can never hope any thing from his pity," &s;aid Morano, "he has u&s;ed me infamou&s;ly, and my vengeance &s;hall pur&s;ue him. And for you, Emily, for you, he has new plans more profitable than the la&s;t, no doubt." The gleam of hope, which the Count's former &s;peech had revived, was now nearly extin|gui&s;hed by the latter; and, while Emily's countenance betrayed the emotions of her mind, he endeavoured to take advantage of the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>"I lo&s;e time," &s;aid he: "I came not to exclaim again&s;t Montoni; I came to &s;olicit, to plead&mdash;to Emily; to tell her all I &s;uffer, to entreat her to &s;ave me from de&s;pair, and her|&s;elf from de&s;truction. Emily! the &s;chemes of Montoni are in-&s;earchable, but I warn you, they are terrible; he has no princi|ple, when intere&s;t, or ambition leads. Can I love you, and abandon you to his power? Fly, then, fly from this gloomy pri|&s;on, with a lover, who adores you! I have bribed a &s;ervant of the ca&s;tle to open the gates, and, before to-morrow's dawn, you &s;hall be far on the way to Venice."</P>
<P>Emily, overcome by the &s;udden &s;hock &s;he had received, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the moment, too, when &s;he had begun to hope for better days, now thought &s;he &s;aw de&s;truction &s;urround her on every &s;ide. Unable to reply, and almo&s;t to think, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair, pale and breathle&s;s. That Montoni had formerly &s;old her to Morano, was very probable; that he had now withdraws,
<PB N="45" REF="029378_0136_0FE081B46B2359A8">
his con&s;ent to the marriage, was evident from the Count's pre&s;ent conduct; and it was nearly certain, that a &s;cheme of &s;tronger intere&s;t only could have induced the &s;elfi&s;h Montoni to forego a plan, which he had hitherto &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly pur&s;ued. The&s;e reflections made her tremble at the hints, which Morano had ju&s;t given, which &s;he no longer he&s;itated to believe; and while &s;he &s;hrunk from the new &s;cenes of mi&s;ery and oppre&s;&s;ion, that might await her in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, &s;he was compelled to ob&s;erve, that almo&s;t her only means of e&s;caping them was by &s;ubmitting her&s;elf to the protection of this man, with whom evils more certain and not le&s;s terrible appeared,&mdash;evils, upon which &s;he could not endure to pau&s;e for an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Her &s;ilence, though it was that of agony, encouraged the hopes of Morano, who watched her countenance with impa|tience, took again the re&s;i&s;ting hand &s;he had withdrawn, and, as he pre&s;&s;ed it to his heart, again conjured her to determine im|mediately. "Every moment we lo&s;e, will make our departure more dangerous," &s;aid he: "the&s;e few moments lo&s;t may enable Montoni to overtake us."</P>
<P>"I be&s;eech, you, &s;ir, be &s;ilent," &s;aid Emily faintly: "I am indeed very wretched, and wretched I mu&s;t remain. Leave me&mdash;I command you, leave me to my fate."</P>
<P>"Never!" cried the Count vehemently: "let me peri&s;h fir&s;t! But forgive my violence! the thought of lo&s;ing you is madne&s;s. You cannot be ignorant of Montoni's character, you may be ig|norant of his &s;chemes&mdash;nay, you mu&s;t be &s;o, or you would not he&s;itate between my love and his power."</P>
<P>"Nor do I he&s;itate," &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Let us go, then," &s;aid Morano, eagerly ki&s;&s;ing her hand, and ri&s;ing, "my carriage waits, below the ca&s;tle walls."</P>
<P>"You mi&s;take me, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily. "Allow me to thank you for the intere&s;t you expre&s;s in my welfare, and to decide by my own choice. I &s;hall remain under the protection of Signor Montoni."</P>
<P>"Under his protection!" exclaimed Morano, proudly, "his <HI>protection!</HI> Emily, why will you &s;uffer your&s;elf to be thus delud|ed? I have already told you what you have to expect from his <HI>protection."</HI></P>
<P>"And pardon me, &s;ir, if, in this in&s;tance, I doubt mere a&s;&s;er|tion, and, to be convinced, require &s;omething approaching to proof."</P>
<P>"I have now neither the time, or the means of adducing proof," replied the Count.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="029378_0137_0FE081C0200065E8">
"Nor have I, &s;ir, the inclination to li&s;ten to it, if you had."</P>
<P>"But you trifle with my patience and my di&s;tre&s;s," continu|ed Morano. "Is a marriage with a man, who adores you, &s;o very terrible in your eyes, that you would prefer it to all the mi&s;ery, to which Montoni may condemn you in this remote pri|&s;on? Some wretch mu&s;t have &s;tolen tho&s;e affections, which ought to be mine, or you could not thus ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in re|fu&s;ing an offer, that would place you beyond the reach of op|pre&s;&s;ion." Morano walked about the room, with quick &s;teps, and a di&s;turbed air.</P>
<P>"This di&s;cour&s;e, Count Morano, &s;ufficiently proves, that my affections ought not to be yours," &s;aid Emily, mildly, "and this conduct, that I &s;hould not be placed beyond the reach of oppre&s;|&s;ion, &s;o long as I remained in your power. If you wi&s;h me to believe otherwi&s;e, cea&s;e to oppre&s;s me any longer by your pre|&s;ence. If you refu&s;e this, you will compel me to expo&s;e you to the re&s;entment of Signor Montoni."</P>
<P>"Yes, let him come," cried Morano furiou&s;ly, "and brave <HI>my</HI> re&s;entment! Let him dare to face once more the man he has &s;o courageou&s;ly injured; danger &s;hall teach him morality, and vengeance ju&s;tice&mdash;let him come, and receive my &s;word in his heart!"</P>
<P>The vehemence, with which this was uttered, gave Emily new cau&s;e of alarm, who aro&s;e from her chair, but her trembling frame refu&s;ed to &s;upport her, and &s;he re&s;umed her &s;eat;&mdash;the words died on her lips, and, when &s;he looked wi&s;tfully towards the door of the corridor, which was locked, &s;he con&s;idered it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to leave the apartment, before Morano would be appri&s;ed of, and able to counteract, her intention.</P>
<P>Without ob&s;erving her agitation, he continued to pace the room in the utmo&s;t perturbation of &s;pirits. His darkened coun|tenance expre&s;&s;ed all the rage of jealou&s;y and revenge; and a per|&s;on, who had &s;een his features under the &s;mile of ineffable tender|ne&s;s, which he &s;o lately a&s;&s;umed, would now &s;carcely have believ|ed them to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>"Count Morano," &s;aid Emily, at length recovering her voice, "calm, I entreat you, the&s;e tran&s;ports, and li&s;ten to rea&s;on, if you will not to pity. You have equally mi&s;placed your love and your hatred. I never could have returned the affection, with which you honour me, and certainly have never encouraged it; neither has Signor Montoni injured you, for you mu&s;t have known, that he had no right to di&s;po&s;e of my hand, had he even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power to do &s;o, Leave, then, leave the ca&s;tle,
<PB N="47" REF="029378_0137_0FE081C0200065E8">
while you may with &s;afety. Spare your&s;elf the dreadful con&s;e|quences of an unju&s;t revenge, and the remor&s;e of having prolong|ed to me the&s;e moments of &s;uffering."</P>
<P>"Is it for mine, or for Montoni's &s;afety that you are thus alarmed?" &s;aid Morano, coldly, and turning towards her with a look of acrimony.</P>
<P>"For both," replied Emily in a trembling voice.</P>
<P>"Unju&s;t revenge!" cried the Count, re&s;uming the abrupt tones of pa&s;&s;ion. "Who that looks upon that face, can imagine a puni&s;hment adequate to the injury he would have done me? Yes, I will leave the ca&s;tle; but it &s;hall not be alone. I have trifled too long. Since my prayers and my &s;ufferings cannot prevail, force &s;hall. I have people in waiting, who &s;hall convey you to my carriage. Your voice will bring no &s;uccour; it can|not be heard from this remote part of the ca&s;tle; &s;ubmit, there|fore in &s;ilence to go with me."</P>
<P>This was an unnece&s;&s;ary injunction, at pre&s;ent; for Emily was too certain, that her call would avail her nothing; and terror had &s;o entirely di&s;ordered her thoughts, that &s;he knew not how to plead to Morano, but &s;at, mute and trembling, in her chair, till he advanced to lift her from it, when &s;he &s;uddenly rai&s;ed her|&s;elf and with a repul&s;ive ge&s;ture, and a countenance of forced &s;e|renity, &s;aid, "Count Morano! I am now in your power; but you will ob&s;erve, that this is not the conduct which can win the e&s;teem you appear &s;o &s;olicitous to obtain, and that you are pre|paring for your&s;elf a load of remor&s;e, in the mi&s;eries of a friend|le&s;s orphan, which can never leave you. Do you believe your heart to be, indeed, &s;o hardened, that you can look without emotion on the &s;uffering, to which you would condemn me?"&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily was interrupted by the growling of the dog, who now came again from the bed, and Morano looked towards the door of the &s;tairca&s;e, where no per&s;on appearing, he called aloud, "Ce&s;ario!"</P>
<P>"Emily," &s;aid the Count, "why will you reduce me to adopt this conduct? How much more willingly would I per&s;uade, than compel you to become my wife! but, by Heaven! I will not leave you to be &s;old by Montoni. Yet a thought glances acro&s;s my mind, that brings madne&s;s with it.&mdash;I know not how to name it. It is prepo&s;terous&mdash;it cannot be.&mdash;Yet you tremble&mdash;you grow pale! It is! it is &s;o;&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;love Montoni!" cried Morano, gra&s;ping Emily's wri&s;t, and &s;tamping his foot on the floor.</P>
<P>An involuntary air of &s;urpri&s;e appeared on her countenance. "If you have indeed believed &s;o," &s;aid &s;he, "believe &s;o &s;till."</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="029378_0138_0FE081C4B5A11488">
"That look, tho&s;e words confirm it," exclaimed Morano, fu|riou&s;ly. "No, no, no, Montoni had a richer prize in view, than gold. But he &s;hall not live to triumph over me!&mdash;This very in&s;tant&mdash;"</P>
<P>He was interrupted by the loud barking of the dog.</P>
<P>"Stay, Count Morano," &s;aid Emily, terrified by his words, and by the fury expre&s;&s;ed in his eyes, "I will &s;ave you from this error.&mdash;Of all men, Signor Montoni is not your rival; though, if I find all other means of &s;aving my&s;elf vain, I will try whether my voice may not arou&s;e his &s;ervants to my &s;uccour."</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;ertion," replied Morano, "at &s;uch a moment, is not to be depended upon. How could I &s;uffer my&s;elf to doubt, even for an in&s;tant, that he could &s;ee you, and not love?&mdash;But my fir&s;t care &s;hall be to convey you from the ca&s;tle. Ce&s;ario! ho,&mdash;Ce&s;ario!"</P>
<P>A man now appeared at the door of the &s;tairca&s;e, and other &s;teps were heard a&s;cending. Emily uttered a loud &s;hriek, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Morano hurried her acro&s;s the chamber, and, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame mo|ment, &s;he heard a noi&s;e at the door, that opened upon the corri|dor. The Count pau&s;ed an in&s;tant, as if his mind was &s;u&s;pended between love and the de&s;ire of vengeance; and, in that in&s;tant, the door gave way, and Montoni, followed by the old &s;teward and &s;everal other per&s;ons, bur&s;t into the room.</P>
<P>"Draw!" cried Montoni to the Count, who did not pau&s;e for a &s;econd bidding, but, giving Emily into the hands of the people, that appeared from the &s;tairca&s;e, turned fiercely round. "This is thine heart, villain!" &s;aid he, as he made a thru&s;t at Montoni with his &s;word, who parried the blow, and aimed ano|ther, while &s;ome of the per&s;ons, who had followed him into the room, endeavoured to part the combatants, and others re&s;cu|ed Emily from the hands of Morano's &s;ervants.</P>
<P>"Was it for this, Count Morano," &s;aid Montoni, in a cool &s;arca&s;tic tone of voice, "that I received you under my roof, and permitted you, though my declared enemy, to remain under it for the night? Was it, that you might repay my ho&s;pitality with the treachery of a fiend, and rob me of my niece?"</P>
<P>"Who talks of treachery?" &s;aid Morano, in a tone of unre|&s;trained vehemence. "Let him that does, &s;hew an unblu&s;hing face of innocence. Montoni, you are a villain! If there is treach|ery in this affair, look to your&s;elf as the author of it. <HI>If</HI>&mdash;do I &s;ay? <HI>I</HI> whom you have wronged with unexampled ba&s;ene&s;s, whom you have injured almo&s;t beyond redre&s;s! But why do I u&s;e words?&mdash;Come on, coward, and receive ju&s;tice at my hands!"</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="029378_0138_0FE081C4B5A11488">
"Coward!" cried Montoni, bur&s;ting from the people who held him, and ru&s;hing on the Count, when they both retreated into the corridor, where the fight continued &s;o de&s;perately, that none of the &s;pectator's dared approach them, Montoni &s;wearing that the fir&s;t, who interfered, &s;hould fall by his &s;word.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y and revenge lent all their fury to Morano, while the &s;uperior &s;kill and the temperance of Montoni enabled him to wound his adver&s;ary, whom his &s;ervants now attempted to &s;eize, but he would not be re&s;trained, and, regardle&s;s of his wound, continued to fight. He &s;eemed to be in&s;en&s;ible both of pain and lo&s;s of blood, and alive only to the energy of his pa&s;&s;ions. Mon|toni on the contrary, per&s;evered in the combat, with a fierce, yet weary valour; he received the point of Morano's &s;word on his arm, but, almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant, &s;everely wounded and di&s;armed him. The Count then fell back into the arms of his &s;ervant, while Montoni held his &s;word over him, and bade him a&s;k his life. Morano, &s;inking under the angui&s;h of his wound, had &s;carcely replied by a ge&s;ture, and by a few words, feebly ar|ticulated, that he would not&mdash;when he fainted; and Montoni was then going to have plunged the &s;word into his brea&s;t, as he lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s, but his arm was arre&s;ted by Cavigni. To the in|terruption he yielded without much difficulty, but his complex|ion changed almo&s;t to blackne&s;s, as he looked upon his fallen ad|ver&s;ary, and ordered that he &s;hould be carried in&s;tantly from the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Emily, who had been withheld from leav|ing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> during the affray, now came forward into the corridor, and pleaded a cau&s;e of common humanity, with the feelings of the warme&s;t benevolence, when &s;he entreated Montoni to allow Morano the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the ca&s;tle, which his &s;ituation required. But Montoni, who had &s;eldom li&s;tened to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, now &s;eemed rapacious of vengeance, and, with a mon&s;ter's cruelty, again ordered his defeated enemy to be taken from the ca&s;tle, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, though there were only the woods, or a &s;olitary neighbouring cottage, to &s;helter him from the night.</P>
<P>The Count's &s;ervants having declared that they would not move him till he revived, Montoni's &s;tood inactive, Cavigni re|mon&s;trating, and Emily, &s;uperior to Montoni's menaces, giving water to Morano, and directing the attendants to bind up his wound. At length Montoni had lei&s;ure to feel pain from his own hurt, and he withdrew to examine it.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, having &s;lowly recovered, the fir&s;t ob|ject he &s;aw, on rai&s;ing his eyes, was Emily, bending over him
<PB N="50" REF="029378_0139_0FE081CEC74607B0">
with a countenance &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of &s;olicitude. He &s;ur|veyed her with a look of angui&s;h.</P>
<P>"I have de&s;erved this," &s;aid he, "but not from Montoni. It is from you, Emily, that I have de&s;erved puni&s;hment, yet I re|ceive only pity!" He pau&s;ed, for he had &s;poken with difficulty. After a moment he proceeded. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t re&s;ign you, but not to Montoni. Forgive me the &s;ufferings I have already occa&s;ioned you! But for <HI>that</HI> villain&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed.

"I am i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> no condition to travel: you mu&s;t, therefore, take me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> cottage, for I will not pa&s;s the night under his roof, although I may expire on the way from it."</P>
<P>Ce&s;ario propo&s;ed to go out, and inquire for a cottage, that might receive his ma&s;ter, before he attempted to remove him: but Morano was impatient to be gone; the angui&s;h of his mind &s;eemed to be even greater than that of his wound, and he rejected, with di&s;dain, the offer of Cavigni to entreat Montoni, that he might be &s;uffered to pa&s;s the night in the ca&s;tle. Ce&s;ario was now going to call up the carriage to the great gate, but the Count forbade him. "I cannot bear the motion of a carriage," &s;aid he: "call &s;ome others of my people, that they may a&s;&s;i&s;t in bearing me in their arms."</P>
<P>At length, however, Morano &s;ubmitted to rea&s;on and con|&s;ented, that Ce&s;ario &s;hould fir&s;t prepare &s;ome cottage to receive him. Emily, now that he had recovered his &s;en&s;es, was about to withdraw from the corridor, when a me&s;&s;age came from Mon|toni commanded her to do &s;o, and al&s;o that the Count if he was not already gone, &s;hould quit the ca&s;tle immediately. Indigna|tion fla&s;hed from Morano's eyes, and flu&s;hed his cheeks.</P>
<P>"Tell Montoni," &s;aid he, "that I &s;hall go when it &s;uits my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> convenience: that I quit the ca&s;tle, he dares to call his, as I would the ne&s;t of a &s;erpent, and that this is not the la&s;t he &s;hall hear from me.

<P>"Count Morano! do you know what you &s;ay?" &s;aid Cavigni.</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor, I know well what I &s;ay, and he will under|&s;tand well what I mean. His con&s;cience will a&s;&s;i&s;t his under|&s;tanding, on this occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Count Morano," &s;aid Verezzi, who had hitherto &s;ilently ob&s;erved him, "dare again to in&s;ult my friend, and I will plunge this &s;word in your body."</P>
<P>"It would be an action worthy the friend of a villain!" &s;aid Morano, as the &s;trong impul&s;e of his indignation enabled him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

rai&s;e him&s;elf from the arms of his &s;ervants; but the energy was momentary, and he &s;unk back, exhau&s;ted by the effort. Mon|toni's people, meanwhile, held Verezzi, who &s;eemed inclined, even in this in&s;tant, to execute his threat; and Cavigni, who was not &s;o depraved as to abet the cowardly malignity of Ve|rezzi, endeavoured to withdraw him from the corridor; and Emily, whom a compa&s;&s;ionate intere&s;t had thus long detained, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow quitting it in new terror, when the &s;upplicating voice of Morano arre&s;ted her, and, by a feeble ge&s;ture, he beckoned her to draw nearer. She advanced with timid &s;teps, but the fainting languor of his countenance again awakened her pity, and overcame her terror.</P>
<P>"I am going from hence for ever" &s;aid he: "perhaps, I &s;hall never &s;ee you again. I would carry with me your for|givene&s;s, Emily, nay more&mdash;I would carry your good wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>"You have my forgivene&s;s, then," &s;aid Emily, "and my &s;incere wi&s;hes for your recovery."</P>
<P>"And only for my recovery?" &s;aid Morano, with a &s;igh. "For your general welfare," added Emily.</P>
<P>"Perhaps I ought to be contented with this," he re&s;umed; "I certainly have not de&s;erved more: but I would a&s;k you, Emily, &s;ometimes to think of me, and, forgetting my offence, to remember only the pa&s;&s;ion which occa&s;ioned it. I would a&s;k, alas! impo&s;&s;ibilities: I would a&s;k, you to love me! At this mo|ment, when I am about to part with you, and that, perhaps, for ever, I am &s;carcely my&s;elf. Emily&mdash;may you never know the torture of a pa&s;&s;ion like mine! What do I &s;ay? O, that, for me, you might be &s;en&s;ible of &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion!"</P>
<P>Emily looked impatient to be gone. "I entreat you, Count, to con&s;ult your own &s;afety," &s;aid &s;he, "and linger here no lon|ger. I tremble for the con&s;equences of Signor Verezzi's pa&s;&s;ion, and of Montoni's re&s;entment, &s;hould he learn that you are &s;till here."</P>
<P>Morano's face was over&s;pread with a momentary crim&s;on, his eyes &s;parkled, but he &s;eemed endeavouring to conquer his emo|tion, and replied in a calm voice, "Since you are intere&s;ted for my &s;afety, I will regard it, and be gone. But, before I go, let me again hear you &s;ay, that you wi&s;h me well," &s;aid he, fixing on her an earne&s;t and mournful look.</P>
<P>Emily repeated her a&s;&s;urances. He took her hand, which &s;he &s;carcely attempted to withdraw, and put it to his lips. "Fare|wel, Count Morano!" &s;aid Emily; and &s;he turned to go, when a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me&s;&s;age arrived from Montoni, and &s;he again conjured
<PB N="52" REF="029378_0140_0FE081D4A03E3238">
Morano, as he valued his life, to quit the ca&s;tle immediately. He regarded her in &s;ilence, with a look of fixed de&s;pair. But &s;he had no time to enforce her compa&s;&s;ionate entreaties, and not during to di&s;obey the &s;econd command of Montoni, &s;he left the corridor to attend him.</P>
<P>He was in the cedar parlour, that adjoined the great hall, laid upon a couch, and &s;uffering a degree of angui&s;h from his wound, which few per&s;ons could have di&s;gui&s;ed, as he did. His coun|tenance, which was &s;tern, but calm, expre&s;&s;ed the dark pa&s;&s;ion of revenge, but no &s;ymptom of pain; bodily pain, indeed, he had always de&s;pi&s;ed, and had yielded only to the &s;trong and terrible energies of the &s;oul. He was attended by old Carlo and by Sig|nor Bertolini, but Madame Montoni was not with him.</P>
<P>Emily trembled, as &s;he approached and received his &s;evere re|buke, for not having obeyed his fir&s;t &s;ummons; and perceived, al&s;o, that he attributed her &s;tay in the corridor to a motive, that had not even occurred to her artle&s;s mind.</P>
<P>"This is an in&s;tance of female caprice," &s;aid he, "which I ought to have fore&s;een. Count Morano, who&s;e &s;uit you ob&s;ti|nately rejected, &s;o long as it was countenanced by me, you fa|vour, it &s;eems, &s;ince you find I have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him."</P>
<P>Emily looked a&s;toni&s;hed. "I do not comprehend you, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he: "You certainly do not mean to imply, that the de&s;ign of the Count to vi&s;it the double-chamber, was founded upon any approbation of mine."</P>
<P>"To that I reply nothing," &s;aid Montoni; "but it mu&s;t cer|tainly be a more than common intere&s;t, that made you plead &s;o warmly in his cau&s;e, and that could detain you thus long in his pre&s;ence, contrary to my expre&s;s order&mdash;in the pre&s;ence of a man, whom you have hitherto, on all occa&s;ions, mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly &s;hunned!"</P>
<P>"I fear, &s;ir, it was a more than common intere&s;t, that detained me," &s;aid Emily calmly; "for of late I have been inclined to think, that of compa&s;&s;ion is an uncommon one. But how could I, could <HI>you</HI> &s;ir, witne&s;s Count Morano's deplorable condi|tion, and not wi&s;h to relieve it?"</P>
<P>"You add hypocri&s;y to caprice," &s;aid Montoni, frowning, "and an attempt at &s;atire, to both; but, before you undertake to regulate the morals of other per&s;ons, you &s;hould learn and practice the virtues, which are indi&s;pen&s;able to a woman&mdash;&s;in|cerity, uniformity of conduct and obedience."</P>
<P>Emily, who had always endeavoured to regulate her conduct by the nice&s;t laws, and who&s;e mind was finely &s;en&s;ible, not only
<PB N="53" REF="029378_0140_0FE081D4A03E3238">
of what is ju&s;t in morals, but of whatever is beautiful in the fe|male character, was &s;hocked by the&s;e words; yet, in the next moment, her heart &s;welled with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having de|&s;erved prai&s;e, in&s;tead of cen&s;ure, and &s;he was proudly &s;ilent. Montoni, acquainted with the delicacy of her mind, knew how keenly &s;he would feel his rebuke; but he was a &s;tranger to the luxury of con&s;cious worth, and, therefore, did not fore&s;ee the energy of that &s;entiment, which now repelled his &s;atire. Turn|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;ervant who had lately entered the room, he a&s;ked whether Morano had quitted the ca&s;tle. The man an&s;wered, that his &s;ervants were then removing him, on a couch, to a neigh|bouring cottage. Montoni &s;eemed &s;omewhat appea&s;ed, on hear|ing this; and, when Ludovico appeared, a few moments after, and &s;aid, that Morano was gone, he told Emily &s;he might retire to her apartment.</P>
<P>She withdrew willingly from his pre&s;ence; but the thought of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of the night in a chamber, which the door from the &s;tairca&s;e made liable to the intru&s;ion of any per&s;on, now alarmed her more than ever, and &s;he determined to call at Madame Montoni's room, and reque&s;t, that Annette might be permitted to be with her.</P>
<P>On reaching the great gallery, &s;he heard voices &s;eemingly in di&s;pute, and, her &s;pirits now apt to take alarm, &s;he pau&s;ed, but &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ome words of Cavigni and Verezzi, and went towards them, in the hope of conciliating their difference. They were alone. Verezzi's face was &s;till flu&s;hed with rage; and, as the fir&s;t object of it was now removed from him, he appeared willing to transfer his re&s;entment to Cavigni, who &s;eemed to be expo&s;tulating, rather than di&s;puting, with him.</P>
<P>Verezzi was prote&s;ting, that he would in&s;tantly inform Mon|toni of the in&s;ult, which Morano had thrown out again&s;t him, and above all, that, wherein he had accu&s;ed him of murder.</P>
<P>"There is no an&s;wering," &s;aid Cavigni, "for the words of a man in a pa&s;&s;ion; little &s;erious regard ought to be paid to them. If you per&s;i&s;t in your re&s;olution, the con&s;equences may be fatal to both. We have now more &s;erious intere&s;ts to pur&s;ue, than tho&s;e of a petty revenge."</P>
<P>Emily joined her entreaties to Cavigni's arguments, and they, at length, prevailed &s;o far, as that Verezzi con&s;ented to retire, without &s;eeing Montoni.</P>
<P>On calling at her aunt's apartment, &s;he found it fa&s;tened. In a few minutes, however, it was opened by Madame Montoni her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="029378_0141_0FE081E2015771E0">
It may be remembered, that it was by a door leading into the bed room from a back pa&s;&s;age, that Emily had &s;ecretly entered a few hours preceding. She now conjectured, by the calmne&s;s of Madame Montoni's air, that &s;he was not appri&s;ed of the acci|dent, which had befallen her hu&s;band, and was beginning to in|form her of it, in the tendere&s;t manner &s;he could, when her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> interrupted her, by &s;aying &s;he was acquainted with the whole affair.</P>
<P>Emily knew indeed, that &s;he had little rea&s;on to love Mon|toni, but could &s;carcely have believed her capable of &s;uch perfect apathy, as &s;he now di&s;covered towards him; having obtained permi&s;&s;ion, however, for Annette to &s;leep in her chamber, &s;he went thither immediately.</P>
<P>A track of blood appeared along the corridor, leading to it; and on the &s;pot, where the Count and Montoni had fought, the whole floor was &s;tained. Emily &s;huddered, and leaned on Annette, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed. When &s;he reached her apartment, &s;he in&s;tantly deter|mined, &s;ince the door of the &s;tairca&s;e had been left open, and that Annette was now with her, to explore whither it led,&mdash;a circum&s;tance now materially connected with her own &s;afety.&mdash;Annette accordingly, half curious and half afraid, propo&s;ed to de&s;cend the &s;tairs; but on approaching the door, they perceived that it was already fa&s;tened without, and their care was then di|rected to the &s;ecuring it on the in&s;ide al&s;o, by placing again&s;t it as much of the heavy furniture of the room, as they could li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t.

<P>IT is now nece&s;&s;ary to mention &s;ome circum&s;tances, which could not be related amid&s;t the events of Emily's ha&s;ty departure from Venice, or together with tho&s;e, which &s;o rapidly &s;ucceeded to her arrival in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>On the morning of her journey, Count Morano had gone at the appointed hour to the man&s;ion of Montoni, to demand his bride. When he reached it, he was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed by the
<PB N="55" REF="029378_0141_0FE081E2015771E0">
&s;ilence and &s;olitary air of the portico, where Montoni's lacquey's u&s;ually loitered; but &s;urpri&s;e was &s;oon changed to a&s;toni&s;hment, and a&s;toni&s;hment to the rage of di&s;appointment, when the door was opened by an old woman, who told his &s;ervants, that her ma&s;ter and his family had left Venice, early in the morning, for <HI>Terrafirma.</HI> Scarcely believing what his &s;ervants told, he left his gondola, and ru&s;hed into the hall to inquire further. The old woman, who was the only per&s;on left in care of the man&s;ion, per&s;i&s;ted in her &s;tory, which the &s;ilent and de&s;erted apartments &s;oon convinced him was no fiction. He then &s;eized her with a menacing air, as if he meant to wreak all his vengeance upon her, at the &s;ame time a&s;king her twenty que&s;tions in a breath, and all the&s;e with a ge&s;ticulation &s;o furious, that &s;he was deprived of the power of an&s;wering them; then &s;uddenly letting her go, he &s;tamped about the hall, like a madman, cur&s;ing Montoni and his own folly.</P>
<P>When the good woman was at liberty, and had &s;omewhat recovered from her fright, &s;he told him all &s;he knew of the affair, which, was, indeed, very little, but enough to enable Morano to di&s;cover, that Montoni was gone to his ca&s;tle on the Appen|nine. Thither he followed as &s;oon as his &s;ervants could com|plete the nece&s;&s;ary preparation for the journey, accompanied by a friend, and attended by a number of his people, determined to obtain Emily or a full revenge on Montoni. When his mind had recovered from the fir&s;t efferve&s;cence of rage, and his thoughts became le&s;s ob&s;cured, his con&s;cience hinted to him certain cir|cum&s;tances, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, explained the conduct of Montoni: but how the latter could have been led to &s;u&s;pect an intention, which, he had believed, was known only to him&s;elf, he could not even gue&s;s. On this occa&s;ion, however, he had been partly betrayed by that &s;ympathetic intelligence, which may be &s;aid to exi&s;t between bad minds, and which teaches one man to judge what another will do in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. Thus it was with Montoni, who had now received indi&s;putable proof of a truth, which he had &s;ometime &s;u&s;pected&mdash;that Mo|rano's circum&s;tances, in&s;tead of being affluent, as he had been bidden to believe, were greatly involved. Montoni had been intere&s;ted in his &s;uit, by motives entirely &s;elfi&s;h, tho&s;e of avarice and pride; the la&s;t of which would have been gratified by an alliance with a Venetian nobleman, the former by Emily's e&s;tate in Ga&s;cony, which he had &s;tipulated, as the price of his favour, &s;hould be delivered up to him from the day of her marriage.&mdash;In the meantime, he had been led to &s;u&s;pect, the con&s;equence of
<PB N="56" REF="029378_0142_0FE081E6D42A5E68">
the Count's boundle&s;s extravagance; but it was not till the even|ing, preceding the intended nuptials, that he obtained certain in|formation of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. He did not he&s;itate then to infer, that Morano de&s;igned to defraud him of Emily's e&s;tate; and in this &s;uppo&s;ition he was confirmed, and with apparent rea&s;on, by the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of the Count, who, after hav|ing appointed to meet him on that night, for the purpo&s;e of &s;igning the in&s;trument, which was to &s;ecure to him his reward, failed in his engagement. Such a circum&s;tance, indeed, in a man of Morano's gay and thoughtle&s;s character, and at a time when his mind was engaged by the bu&s;tle of preparation for his nuptials, might have been attributed to a cau&s;e le&s;s deci&s;ive, than de&s;ign; but Montoni did not he&s;itate an in&s;tant to interpret in his own way, and after vainly waiting the Count's arrival, for &s;ev|eral hours, he gave orders for his people to be in readine&s;s to &s;et off at a moment's notice. By ha&s;tening to Udolpho he intended to remove Emily from the reach of Morano, as well as to break off the affair, without &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to u&s;ele&s;s altercation: and, if the Count meant what he called honourably, he would doubt|le&s;s follow Emily, and &s;ign the writings in que&s;tion. If this was done, &s;o little con&s;ideration had Montoni for her welfare, that he would not have &s;crupled to &s;acrifice her to a man of ruin|ed fortune, &s;ince by that means he could enrich him&s;elf; and he forebore to mention to her the motive of his &s;udden journey le&s;t the hope it might revive &s;hould render her more intractable, when &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion would be required.</P>
<P>With the&s;e con&s;iderations, he had left Venice; and, with others totally different, Morano had, &s;oon after, pur&s;ued his &s;teps acro&s;s the rugged Apennines. When his arrival was announced at the ca&s;tle, Montoni did not believe, that he would have pre|&s;umed to &s;hew him&s;elf, unle&s;s he had meant to fulfil his engage|ment, and he, therefore, readily admitted him; but the enraged countenance and expre&s;&s;ions of Morano, as he entered the apart|ment, in&s;tantly undeceived him; and, when Montoni had ex|plained, in part, the motives of his abrupt departure from Venice, the Count &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in demanding Emily, and reproaching Montoni, without even naming the former &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>Montoni, at length, weary of the di&s;pute, deferred the &s;ettling of it till the morrow, and Morano retired with &s;ome hope, &s;ug|ge&s;ted by Montoni's apparent indeci&s;ion. When, however, in the &s;ilence of his own apartment, he began to con&s;ider the pa&s;t conver&s;ation, the character of Montoni, and &s;ome former in|&s;tances of his duplicity, the hope, which he had admitted, van|i&s;hed,
<PB N="57" REF="029378_0142_0FE081E6D42A5E68">
and he determined not to neglect the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining Emily by other means. To his confidential val|et he told his de&s;ign of carrying away Emily, and &s;ent him back to Montoni's &s;ervants to find out one among them, who might enable him to execute it. The choice of this per&s;on he entru&s;ted to the fellow's own di&s;cernment, and not imprudently; for he di&s;covered a man, whom Montoni had, on &s;ome former occa&s;ion, treated har&s;hly, and who was now ready to betray him. This man conducted Ce&s;ario round the ca&s;tle, through a private pa&s;|&s;age, to the &s;tairca&s;e, that led to Emily's chamber; then &s;hewed him a &s;hort way out of the building, and afterwards procured him the keys, that would &s;ecure his retreat. The man was well rewarded for his trouble; how the Count was rewarded for his treachery has already appeared.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, old Carlo had overheard two of Morano's &s;er|vants, who had been ordered to be in waiting with the carriage, beyond the ca&s;tle walls, expre&s;&s;ing their &s;urpri&s;e at their ma&s;ter's &s;udden, and &s;ecret departure, for the valet had entru&s;ted them with no more of Morano's de&s;igns, than it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to execute. They, however, indulged them&s;elves in &s;urmi&s;es, and in expre&s;&s;ing them to each other; and from the&s;e Carlo had drawn a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion. But, before he ventured to di&s;clo&s;e his apprehen&s;ions to Montoni, he endeavoured to obtain further con|firmation of them, and, for this purpo&s;e, placed him&s;elf, with one of his fellow &s;ervants, at the door of Emily's apartment, that opened upon the corridor. He did not watch long in vain, though the growling of the dog had once nearly betrayed him. When he was convinced, that Morano was in the room, and had li&s;tened long enough to his conver&s;ation, to under&s;tand his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me, he immediately alarmed Montoni, and thus re&s;cued Emily from the de&s;igns of the Count.</P>
<P>Montoni, on the following morning, appeared as u&s;ual, ex|cept that he wore his wounded arm in a &s;ling; he went out upon the ramparts; overlooked the men employed in repairing them gave orders for additional workmen, and then came into the ca&s;tle to give audience to &s;everal per&s;ons, who were ju&s;t ar|rived, and who were &s;hewn into a private apartment, where he communicated with them, for near an hour. Carlo was then &s;ummoned, and ordered to conduct the &s;trangers to a part of the ca&s;tle, which, in former times, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> occupied by the upper &s;ervants of the family, and to provide them with every nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment.&mdash;When he had done this, he was bidden to return to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="029378_0143_0FE081F528D87F48">
Meanwhile, the Count remained in a cottage in the &s;kirts of the woods below, &s;uffering under bodily and mental pain, and meditating deep revenge again&s;t Montoni. His &s;ervant, whom he had di&s;patched for a &s;urgeon to the neare&s;t town, which was, however, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, did not return till the fol|lowing day, when, his wounds being examined and dre&s;&s;ed, the practitioner refu&s;ed to deliver any po&s;itive opinion, concerning the degree of danger attending them; but, giving his patient a compo&s;ing draught and ordering him to be kept quiet, remained at the cottage to watch the event.</P>
<P>Emily, for the remainder of the late eventful night, had been &s;uffered to &s;leep, undi&s;turbed; and, when her mind recovered from the confu&s;ion of &s;lumber, and &s;he remembered, that &s;he was now relea&s;ed from the addre&s;&s;es of Count Morano, her &s;pir|its were &s;uddenly relieved from a part of the terrible anxiety, that had long oppre&s;&s;ed them; that which remained, aro&s;e chief|ly from a recollection of Morano's a&s;&s;ertions, concerning the &s;chemes of Montoni. He had &s;aid, that plans of the latter, con|cerning Emily, were in&s;earchable, yet that he knew them to be terrible. At the time he uttered this, &s;he almo&s;t believed it to be de&s;igned for the purpo&s;e of prevailing with her to throw her|&s;elf into his protection, and &s;he &s;till thought it might be chiefly &s;o accounted for; but his a&s;&s;ertions had left an impre&s;&s;ion on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mind, which a con&s;ideration of that character and former con|duct of Montoni did not contribute to efface. She, however, checked her propen&s;ity to anticipate evil; and, determined to en|joy this re&s;pite from actual misfortune, tried to di&s;mi&s;s thought, took her in&s;truments for drawing, and placed her&s;elf at a window, to &s;elect into a land&s;cape &s;ome features of the &s;cenery without.</P>
<P>As &s;he was thus employed, &s;he &s;aw, walking on the rampart below, the men, who had &s;o lately arrived at the ca&s;tle. The &s;ight of &s;trangers &s;urpri&s;ed her, but &s;till more, of &s;trangers &s;uch as the&s;e. There was a &s;ingularity in their dre&s;s, and a certain fiercene&s;s in their air, that fixed all her attention. She withdrew from the ca&s;ement, while they pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;oon returned to ob|&s;erve them further. Their figures &s;eemed &s;o well &s;uited to the wildne&s;s of the &s;urrounding objects, that, as they &s;tood &s;urveying the ca&s;tle, &s;he &s;ketched them for banditti, amid the mountain-view of her picture, when &s;he had fini&s;hed which, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve the &s;pirit of her group. But &s;he had copied from na|ture.</P>
<P>Carlo, when he had placed refre&s;hment before the&s;e men in the apartment a&s;&s;igned to them, returned, as he was ordered, to Mon|toni,
<PB N="59" REF="029378_0143_0FE081F528D87F48">
who was anxious to di&s;cover by what &s;ervant the keys of the ca&s;tle had been delivered to Morano, on the preceding night. But this man, though he was too faithful to his ma&s;ter quietly to &s;ee him injured, would not betray a fellow &s;ervant even to ju&s;|tice; he, therefore pretended to be ignorant who it was, that had con&s;pired with Count Morano, and related, as before, that he had only overheard &s;ome of the &s;trangers de&s;cribing the plot.</P>
<P>Montoni's &s;u&s;picions naturally fell upon the porter, whom he ordered now to attend. Carlo he&s;itated, and then with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;teps went to &s;eek him.</P>
<P>Barnardine, the porter, denied the accu&s;ation with a counte|nance &s;o &s;teady and undaunted, that Montoni could &s;carcely be|lieve him guilty, though he knew not how to think him inno|cent. At length, the man was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pre&s;ence, and, though the real offender, e&s;caped detection.</P>
<P>Montoni then went to his wife's apartment, whither Emily followed &s;oon after, but, finding them in high di&s;pute, was in|&s;tantly leaving the room, when her aunt called her back, and de|&s;ired her to &s;tay.&mdash;"You &s;hall be a witne&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, "of my oppo&s;ition. Now, &s;ir, repeat the command, I have &s;o often re|fu&s;ed to obey."</P>
<P>Montoni turned, with a &s;tern countenance, to Emily, and bade her quit the apartment, while his wife per&s;i&s;ted in de&s;iring, that &s;he would &s;tay. Emily was eager to e&s;cape from this &s;cene of contention, and anxious, al&s;o, to &s;erve her aunt; but &s;he de&s;pair|ed of conciliating Montoni, in who&s;e eyes the ri&s;ing tempe&s;t of his &s;oul fla&s;hed terribly.</P>
<P>"Leave the room," &s;aid he, in a voice of thunder. Emily obeyed, and, walking down to the rampart, which the &s;trangers had now left, continued to meditate on the unhappy marriage of her father's &s;i&s;ter, and on her own de&s;olate &s;ituation, occa&s;ioned by the ridiculous imprudence of her, whom &s;he had always wi&s;h|ed to re&s;pect and love. Madame Montoni's conduct had, indeed, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for Emily to do either; but her gentle heart was touched by her di&s;tre&s;s, and, in the pity thus awaken|ed, &s;he forgot the injurious treatment &s;he had received from her.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;auntered on the rampart, Annette appeared at the hall door, looked cautiou&s;ly round, and then advanced to meet her.</P>
<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle, I have been looking for you all over the ca&s;tle," &s;aid &s;he. "If you will &s;tep this way, I will &s;hew you a picture."</P>
<P>"A picture!" exclaimed Emily, and &s;huddered.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="029378_0144_0FE081F9C1719930">
"Yes, ma'am, a picture of the late lady of this place. Old Carlo ju&s;t now told me it was her, and I thought you would be curious to &s;ee it. As to my lady, you know, ma'am&s;elle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot talk about &s;uch things to her."&mdash;</P>
<P>"And &s;o," &s;aid Emily &s;miling, "as you mu&s;t talk of them to &s;omebody&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Why, yes, ma'am&s;elle; what can one do in &s;uch a place as this, if one mu&s;t not talk? If I was in a dungeon, if they would let me talk&mdash;it would be &s;ome comfort; nay, I would talk, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it was only to the walls. But come, ma'am&s;elle, we lo&s;e time&mdash;let me &s;hew you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the picture."</P>
<P>"Is it veiled?" &s;aid Emily, pau&s;ing.</P>
<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid Annette, fixing her eyes on Emily face, "what makes you look &s;o pale?&mdash;are you ill?"</P>
<P>"No, Annette, I am well enough, but I have no de&s;ire to &s;ee this picture; return into the hall."</P>
<P>"What! ma'am not to &s;ee the lady of this ca&s;tle?" &s;aid the girl&mdash;"the lady, who di&s;appeared &s;o &s;trangely? Well! now I would have run to the furthe&s;t mountain we can &s;ee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to have got a fight of &s;uch a picture; and, to &s;peak my mind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trange &s;tory is all, that makes me care about this old ca&s;tle, though it makes me thrill all over, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were, whenever I think of it."</P>
<P>"Yes, Annette, you love the wonderful; but do you know&punc; that, unle&s;s you guard again&s;t this inclination, it will lead you into all the mi&s;ery of &s;uper&s;tition?"</P>
<P>Annette might have &s;miled in her turn, at this &s;age ob&s;erva|tion of Emily, who could tremble with ideal terrors, as much as her&s;elf, and li&s;ten almo&s;t as eagerly to the recital of a my&s;te|rious &s;tory. Annette urged her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>"Are you &s;ure it is a picture?" &s;aid Emily, "Have you &s;een it?&mdash;Is it veiled!"</P>
<P>"Holy Maria! ma'am&s;elle, yes, no, yes. I am &s;ure it is a picture&mdash;I have &s;een it and it is not veiled!"</P>
<P>The tone and look of &s;urpri&s;e, with which this was uttered, recalled Emily's prudence; who concealed her emotion under a &s;mile, and bade Annette lead her to the picture. It was in as ob&s;cure chamber, adjoining that part of the ca&s;tle, allotted to the &s;ervants. Several other portraits hung on the walls, cover|er, like this, with du&s;t and cobweb.</P>
<P>"That is it ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, in a low voice, and pointing. Emily advanced, and &s;urveyed the picture. It re|pre&s;ented a lady in the flower of youth and beauty; her fea|tures were hand&s;ome and noble, full of &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little of the captivating &s;weetne&s;s, that Emily had looked for,

and &s;till le&s;s of the pen&s;ive mildne&s;s &s;he loved. It was a coun|tenance, which &s;poke the language of pa&s;&s;ion, rather than that of &s;entiment; a haughty impatience of misfortune&mdash;not the placid melancholy of a &s;pirit injured, yet re&s;igned.</P>
<P>"How many years have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince this lady di&s;appeared, Annette?" &s;aid Emlly.</P>
<P>"Twenty years, ma'am&s;elle, or thereabout, as they tell me; I know it is a long while ago." Emily continued to gaze upon the portrait.</P>
<P>"I think," re&s;umed Annette, "the Signor would do well to hang i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a better place, than this old chamber. Now, in my mind, he ought to place the picture of a lady, who gave him all the&s;e riches, in the hand&s;ome&s;t room in the ca&s;tle. But he may have good rea&s;ons for what he does: and &s;ome people do &s;ay, that he has lo&s;t his riches, as well as his gratitude. But hu&s;h, ma'am, not a word!" added Annette, laying her finger on her lips. Emily was too much ab&s;orbed in thought, to hear what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>"'Tis a hand&s;ome lady, I am &s;ure," continued Annette: "the Signor need not be a&s;hamed to put her in the great apartment where the veiled picture hangs." Emily turned round. "But for that matter, &s;he would be as little &s;een there, as here, for the door is always locked, I find."</P>
<P>"Let us leave this chamber," &s;aid Emily: "and let me cau|tion you again, Annette; be guarded in your conver&s;ation, and never tell, that you know any thing of that picture."</P>
<P>"Holy mother" exclaimed Annette, "it is no &s;ecret; why all the &s;ervants have &s;een i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> already!"</P>
<P>Emily &s;tarted. "How is this?" &s;aid &s;he&mdash;"Have &s;een it! When? how?"</P>
<P>"Dear, ma'am&s;elle, there is nothing &s;urpri&s;ing in that; we had all a little more <HI>curiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> than you had."</P>
<P>"I thought you told me, the door was kept locked?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"If that was the ca&s;e, ma'am&s;elle," replied Annette, looking about her, "how could we get here?"</P>
<P>"O! you mean <HI>this</HI> picture," &s;aid Emily, with returning calmne&s;s. "Well, Annette, here is nothing more to engage my attention; we will go."</P>
<P>Emily, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed to her own apartment, &s;aw Montoni go down to the hall, and &s;he turned into her aunt's dre&s;&s;ing room, whom &s;he found weeping and alone, grief and re&s;entment &s;trug|gling on her countenance. Pride had hitherto re&s;trained com|plaint.
<PB N="62" REF="029378_0145_0FE0820736664500">
Judging of Emily's di&s;po&s;ition from her own, and from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what her treatment of her de&s;erved, &s;he had believed, that her griefs would be cau&s;e of triumph to her niece, rather than of &s;ymthathy; that &s;he would de&s;pi&s;e, not pity her. But &s;he knew not the tenderne&s;s and benevolence of Emily's heart, that had always taught her to forget her own injuries in the misfortunes of her enemy. The &s;ufferings of others, who|ever they might be, called forth her ready compa&s;&s;ion, which di&s;&s;i|pated at once every ob&s;curing cloud to goodne&s;s, that pa&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prejudice might have rai&s;ed in her mind.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni's &s;ufferings, at length, ro&s;e above her pride, and when Emily had before entered the room, &s;he would have told them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not her hu&s;band prevented her; now that &s;he was no longer re&s;trained by his pre&s;ence, &s;he poured forth all her complaints to her niece.</P>
<P>"O Emily!" &s;he exclaimed, "I am the mo&s;t wretched of women&mdash;I am indeed cruelly treated! Who, with my pro&s;pect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of happine&s;s could have fore&s;een &s;uch a wretched fate as this?&punc; who could have thought, when I married &s;uch a man as the Sig|nor, I &s;hould ever have to bewail my lot?

<P>Emily thought &s;he might have fore&s;een it, but this was not a thought of triumph. She placed her&s;elf in a chair near her aunt took her hand, and with one of tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;oft compa&s;&s;ion, which might characterize the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a guardian angel, &s;poke to her in the tendere&s;t accents.

She wanted to complain, not to be con&s;oled; and it was by exclamations of complain only, that Emily learned the par|ticular circum&s;tances of her affliction.</P>
<P>"Ungrateful man!" &s;aid Madame Montoni, "he has deceiv|ed me in every re&s;pect; and now he has taken me from my country and friends, to &s;hut me up in this old ca&s;tle; and, here he thinks he can compel me to do whatever he de&s;igns! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he &s;hall find him&s;elf mi&s;taken, he &s;hall find that no threats can al|ter&mdash;But who would have believed? who would have &s;uppo|&s;ed, that a man of his family and apparent wealth had ab&s;olutely no fortune?&mdash;no, &s;carcely a &s;equin of his own!

She pau&s;ed to take breath.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="029378_0145_0FE0820736664500">
"Dear Madam, be compo&s;ed," &s;aid Emily; "the Signor may not be &s;o rich as you had rea&s;on to expect, but &s;urely he cannot be very poor, &s;ince this ca&s;tle and the man&s;ion at Venice are his. May I a&s;k what are the circum&s;tances, that particular|ly affect you?"</P>
<P>"What are the circum&s;tances?" exclaimed Madame Monto|ni with re&s;entment: "why is it not &s;ufficient, that he had long ago ruined his own fortune by play, and that he has &s;ince lo&s;t what I brought him&mdash;and that now he would compel me to &s;ign away my &s;ettlement (it was well I had the chief of my pro|perty &s;ettled on my&s;elf!) that he may lo&s;e this al&s;o, or throw it away in wild &s;chemes, which nobody can under&s;tand but him|&s;elf? And, and&mdash;is not all this &s;ufficient?"</P>
<P>"It is, indeed," &s;aid Emily, "but you mu&s;t recollect, dear madam, that I knew nothing of all this."</P>
<P>"Well, and is it not &s;ufficient," rejoined her aunt, "that he is al&s;o ab&s;olutely ruined, that he is &s;unk deeply in debt, and that neither this ca&s;tle, or the man&s;ion at Venice, is his own, if all his debts, honourable and di&s;honourable, were paid!"</P>
<P>"I am &s;hocked by what you tell me, madam," &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"And is it not enough," interrupted Madame Montoni, "that he has treated me with neglect, with cruelty, becau&s;e I refu&s;ed to relinqui&s;h my &s;ettlements, and, in&s;tead of being frightened by his menaces, re&s;olutely defied him, and upbraided him with his &s;hameful conduct? But I bore all meekly,&mdash;you know, niece, I never uttered a word of complaint, till now; no! That &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition as mine &s;hould be &s;o impo&s;ed upon! That I, who&s;e only faults are too much kindne&s;s, too much genero&s;ity, &s;hould be chained for life to &s;uch a vile, deceitful, cruel mon&s;ter!"</P>
<P>Want of breath compelled Madame Montoni to &s;top. If any thing could have made Emily &s;mile in the&s;e moments, it would have been this &s;peech of her aunt, delivered in a voice very lit|tle below a &s;cream, and with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of ge&s;ticulation and of countenance, that turned the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> burle&s;que. Emily &s;aw, that her misfortunes did not admit of real con&s;olation, and con|temning the common place terms of &s;uperficial comfort, &s;he was &s;ilent; while Madame Montoni, jealous of her own con&s;equence, mi&s;took this for the &s;ilence of indifference, or of contempt, and reproached her with want of duty and feeling.</P>
<P>"O! I &s;u&s;pected what all this boa&s;ted &s;en&s;ibility would prove to be!" rejoined &s;he; "I thought it would not teach you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o feel either duty, or affection, for your relations, who have treated you like their own daughter!"</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="029378_0146_0FE0820D70D6C308">
"Pardon me, madam," &s;aid Emily mildly, "it is not natural to me to boa&s;t, and if it was, I am &s;ure I would not boa&s;t of &s;en|&s;ibility&mdash;a quality, perhaps, more to be feared, than de&s;ired."</P>
<P>"Well, well, niece, I will not di&s;pute with you. But, as I &s;aid, Montoni threatens me with violence, if I any longer refu&s;e to &s;ign away my &s;ettlements, and this was the &s;ubject of our con|te&s;t, when you came into the room before. Now, I am deter|mined no power on earth &s;hall make me do this. Neither will I bear all this tamely. He &s;hall hear his true character from me; I will tell him all he de&s;erves, in &s;pite of his threats and cruel treatment."</P>
<P>Emily &s;eized a pau&s;e of Madame Montoni's voice, to &s;peak, "Dear madam," &s;aid &s;he, "but will not this &s;erve to irritate the Signor unnece&s;&s;arily? will it not provoke the har&s;h treatment you dread?"</P>
<P>"I do not care," replied Madame Montoni, "it does not &s;ignify: I will not &s;ubmit to &s;uch u&s;age. You would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> give up my &s;ettlements, too, I &s;uppo&s;e!"</P>
<P>"No, madam, I do not exactly mean that."</P>
<P>"What is it you do mean then?"</P>
<P>"You &s;poke of reproaching the Signor,"&mdash;&s;aid Emily, with he&s;itation. "Why, does he not de&s;erve reproaches?" &s;aid her aunt.</P>
<P>"Certainly he does; but will it be prudent in you, madam, to make them?"</P>
<P>"Prudent!" exclaimed Madame Montoni. "Is this a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to talk of prudence, when one is threatened with all &s;orts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> violence?"</P>
<P>"It is to avoid that violence, that prudence is nece&s;&s;ary," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emily.</P>
<P>"Of prudence!" continued Madame Montoni, without at|tending to her, "of prudence towards a man, who does not &s;cru|ple to break all the common ties of humanity in his conduct to me! And is it for me to con&s;ider prudence in my behaviour to|wards him! I am not &s;o mean."</P>
<P>"It is for your own &s;ake, not for the Signor's madam," &s;aid Emily mode&s;tly, "that you &s;hould con&s;ult prudence. Your re|proaches, however ju&s;t, cannot puni&s;h him, but they may provoke him to further violence again&s;t you."</P>
<P>"What! would you have me &s;ubmit, then, to whatever he commands&mdash;would you have me kneel down at his feet and thank him for his cruelties? Would you have me give up my &s;ettlements?"</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="029378_0146_0FE0820D70D6C308">
"How much you mi&s;take me, madam!" &s;aid Emily, "I am unequal to advi&s;e you on a point &s;o important as the la&s;t: but you will pardon me for &s;aying, that, if you con&s;ult your own peace, you will try to conciliate Signor Montoni, rather than to irritate him by reproaches."</P>
<P>"Conciliate indeed! I tell you, niece, it is utterly impo&s;&s;i|ble; I di&s;dain to attempt it."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;hocked to ob&s;erve the perverted under&s;tanding and ob&s;tinate temper of Madame Montoni; but, not le&s;s grieved for her &s;ufferings, &s;he looked round for &s;ome alleviating circum&s;tance to offer her. "Your &s;ituation is, perhaps, not &s;o de&s;perate, dear madam," &s;aid Emily, "as you may imagine. The Signor may repre&s;ent his affairs to be wor&s;e than they are, for the purpo&s;e of pleading a &s;tronger nece&s;&s;ity for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your &s;ettle|ment. Be&s;ides, &s;o long as you keep this, you may look forward to it as a re&s;ource, at lea&s;t, that will afford you a competence, &s;hould the Signor's future conduct compel you to &s;ue for &s;epara|tion."</P>
<P>Madame Montoni impatiently interrupted her. "Unfeeling, cruel girl!" &s;aid &s;he, "and &s;o you would per&s;uade me, that I have no rea&s;on to complain; that the Signor is in very flouri&s;h|ing circum&s;tances, that my future pro&s;pects promi&s;e nothing but comfort, and that my griefs are as fanciful and romantic as your own! is it the way to con&s;ole me, to endeavour to per&s;uade me out of my &s;en&s;es and my feelings, becau&s;e you happen to have no feelings your&s;elf? I thought I was opening my heart to a per&s;on, who could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> in my di&s;tre&s;s, but I find, that your people of &s;en&s;ibility can feel for nobody but them&s;elves! you may re|tire to your chamber."</P>
<P>Emily, without replying, immediately left the room, with a mingled emotion of pity and contempt, and ha&s;tened to her own, where &s;he yielded to the mournful reflections, which a knowledge of her aunt's &s;ituation had occa&s;ioned. The conver&s;ation of the Italian with Valancourt, in France, again oc|curred to her. His hints, re&s;pecting the broken fortunes of Mon|toni, were now completely ju&s;tified: tho&s;e, al&s;o, concerning his character, appeared not le&s;s &s;o, though the particular circum&s;tan|ce, connected with his fame, to which the &s;tranger had alluded, yet, remained to be explained. Notwith&s;tanding, that her own ob&s;ervations and the words of Count Morano had convinced her, that Montoni's &s;ituation was not what it formerly appeared to be, the intelligence &s;he had ju&s;t received from her aunt on this point &s;truck her with all the force of a&s;toni&s;hment, which was
<PB N="66" REF="029378_0147_0FE0821B800CAA30">
not weakened, when &s;he con&s;idered the pre&s;ent &s;tyle of Montoni's living, the number of &s;ervants he maintained, and the new ex|pen&s;es he was incurring, by repairing and fortifying his ca&s;tle.&mdash;Her anxiety for her aunt and for her&s;elf increa&s;ed with reflection. Several a&s;&s;ertions of Morano, which, on the preceding night, &s;he had believed were prompted either by intere&s;t, or by re&s;entment, now returned to her mind with the &s;trength of truth. She could not doubt, that Montoni had formerly agreed to give her to the Count, for a pecuniary reward; his character, and his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances ju&s;tified the belief; the&s;e, al&s;o, &s;eemed to confirm Morano's a&s;&s;ertion, that he now de&s;igned to di&s;po&s;e of her, more advantageou&s;ly for him&s;elf, to a richer &s;uitor.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the reproaches, which Morano had thrown out again&s;t Montoni, he had &s;aid&mdash;he would not quit the ca&s;tle <HI>he dared to call his,</HI> nor willingly leave <HI>another</HI> murder on his con&s;cience&mdash;hints, which might have no other origin than the pa&s;&s;ion of the moment: but Emily was now inclined to account for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> more &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;he &s;huddered to think, that &s;he was in the hands of a man, to whom it was even po&s;&s;ible they could apply. At length, con&s;idering, that reflection could neither relea&s;e her from her melancholy &s;ituation, or enable her to bear it with great|er fortitude, &s;he tried to divert her anxiety, and took do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> from her little library a volume of her favourite Ario&s;to; but his wild imagery and rich invention could not long enchant her at|tention; his &s;pells did not reach her heart, and over her &s;leeping fancy they played, without awakening it.</P>
<P>She now put a&s;ide the book, and took her lute, for it was &s;el|dom that her &s;ufferings refu&s;ed to yield to the magic of &s;weet &s;ounds; when they did &s;o, &s;he was oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;orrow, that came from exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s and regret; and there were times, when mu&s;ic had increa&s;ed &s;uch &s;orrow to a degree, that was &s;carcely endurable; when, if it had not &s;uddenly cea&s;ed, &s;he might have lo&s;t her rea&s;on. Such was the time, when &s;he mourn|ed for her father, and heard the midnight &s;trains, that floated by her window near the convent in Languedoc, on the night that followed his death.</P>
<P>She continued to play, till Annette brought dinner into her chamber, at which Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed, and inquired who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he obeyed. "My lady's, ma'am&s;elle," replied Annette "the Signor ordered her dinner to be carried to her own apart|ment, and &s;o &s;he has &s;ent you yours. There have been &s;ad do|ings between them, wor&s;e than ever, I think."</P>
<P>Emily, not appearing to notice what &s;he &s;aid, &s;at down to the little table, that was &s;pread for her. But Annette was not to be
<PB N="67" REF="029378_0147_0FE0821B800CAA30">
&s;ilenced thus ea&s;ily. While &s;he waited, &s;he told of the arrival of the men, whom Emily had ob&s;erved on the ramparts, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed much &s;urpri&s;e at their &s;trange appearance, as well as at the manner, in which they had been attended by Montoni's or|der. "Do they dine with the Signor, then?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"No, ma'am&s;elle, they dined long ago, in an apartment at the north end of the ca&s;tle, but I know not when they are to go, for the Signor told old Carlo to &s;ee them provided with every thing nece&s;&s;ary. They have been walking all about the ca&s;tle, and a&s;king que&s;tions of the workmen on the ramparts. I never &s;aw &s;uch &s;trange looking men in my life; I am frightened when|ever I &s;ee them."</P>
<P>Emily inquired, if &s;he had heard of Count Morano, and wheth|er he was likely to recover: but Annette only knew, that he was lodged in a cottage in the wood below, and that every bo|dy &s;aid he mu&s;t die. Emily's countenance di&s;covered her emotion.</P>
<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle." &s;aid Annette, "to &s;ee how young ladies will di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves, when they are in love! I thought you hated the Count, or I am &s;ure I would not have told you; and I am &s;ure you have cau&s;e enough to hate him."</P>
<P>"I hope I hate nobody," replied Emily, trying to &s;mile; "but certainly I do not love Count Morano. I &s;hould be &s;hock|ed to hear of any per&s;on dying by violent means."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am&s;elle, but it is his own fault."</P>
<P>Emily looked di&s;plea&s;ed; and Annette, mi&s;taking the cau&s;e of her di&s;plea&s;ure, immediately began to excu&s;e the Count, in her way. "To be &s;ure, it was very ungenteel behaviour," &s;aid &s;he, "to break into a lady's room, and then, when he found his di&s;cour&s;ing was not agreeable to her, to refu&s;e to go; and then, when the gentleman of the ca&s;tle comes to de&s;ire him to walk about his bu&s;ine&s;s,&mdash;to turn round, and draw his &s;word, and &s;wear he'll run him through the body!&mdash;To be &s;ure it was very un|genteel behaviour, but then he was di&s;gui&s;ed in love, and &s;o did not know what he was about."</P>
<P>"Enough of this," &s;aid Emily, who now &s;miled without an effort; and Annette returned to a mention of the di&s;agreement between Montoni and his lady. "It is nothing new," &s;aid &s;he: "we &s;aw and heard enough of this at Venice though I never told you of it, ma'am&s;elle."</P>
<P>"Well, Annette, it was very prudent of you not to mention it then: be as prudent now; the &s;ubject is an unplea&s;ant one."</P>
<P>"Ah dear, ma'am&s;elle!&mdash;to &s;ee now how con&s;iderate you can be about &s;ome folks, who care &s;o little about you! I cannot bear

to &s;ee you &s;o deceived, and I mu&s;t tell you. But it is all for your own good, and not to &s;pite my lady, though, to &s;peak truth, I have little rea&s;on to love her; but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"You are not &s;peaking thus of my aunt, I hope, Annette?" &s;aid Emily, gravely.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am&s;elle, but I am, though; and if you knew as much as I do, you would not look &s;o angry. I have often and often, heard the Signor and her talking over your marriage with the Count, and &s;he always advi&s;ed him never to give up to your fooli&s;h whims, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to call them, but to be re&s;o|lute, and compel you to be obedient, whether you would or no. And I am &s;ure, my heart has ached a thou&s;and times, and I have thought, when &s;he was &s;o unhappy her&s;elf, &s;he might have felt a little for other people, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I thank you for your pity, Annette," &s;aid Emily, inter|rupting her: "but my aunt was unhappy then, and that di&s;|turbed her temper perhaps, or I think&mdash;I am &s;ure&mdash;You may take away, Annette, I have done."</P>
<P>"Dear, ma'am&s;elle, you ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e eat nothing at all! Do try, and take a little hit more. Di&s;turbed her temper truly! why, her temper is always di&s;turbed, I think. And at The lou&s;e too I have heard my lady talking of you and Mon&s;. Valancourt to Madame Merveille and Madame Vai&s;on, often and often, in a very ill-natured way, as I thought, telling them what a deal of trouble &s;he had to keep you in order, and what a fatigue and di&s;tre&s;s it was to her, and that &s;he believed you would run away with Mon&s;. Valancourt, if &s;he was not to watch you clo&s;ely; and that you connived at his coming about the hou&s;e at night, and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, blu&s;hing deeply, "it is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible my aunt could thus have repre&s;ented me!"</P>
<P>"Indeed, ma'am, I &s;ay nothing more than the truth, and not all of that. But I thought, my&s;elf, &s;he might have found &s;ome|thing better to di&s;cour&s;e about, than the faults of her own niece, even if you had been in fault, ma'am&s;elle; but I did not believe a word of what &s;he &s;aid. But my lady does not care what &s;he &s;ays again&s;t any body, for that matter."</P>
<P>"However that may be, Annette," interrupted Emily, recov|ering her compo&s;ure, "it does not become you to &s;peak of the faults of my aunt to me. I know you have meant well, but&mdash;&s;ay no more.&mdash;I have quite dined."</P>
<P>Annette blu&s;hed, looked down, and then began &s;lowly to clear the table.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="029378_0148_0FE0822022D06638">
"Is this, then, the reward of my ingenuou&s;ne&s;s?" &s;aid Emily, when &s;he was alone; "the treatment I am to receive from a re|lation&mdash;an aunt&mdash;who ought to have been the guardian, not the &s;landerer of my reputation,&mdash;who, as a woman, ought to have re|&s;pected the delicacy of female honour, and, as a relation, &s;hould have protected mine! But, to utter fal&s;ehoods on &s;o nice a &s;ub|ject&mdash;to repay the openne&s;s, and, I may &s;ay with hone&s;t pride, the propriety of my conduct, with &s;landers&mdash;required a depravity of heart, &s;uch as I could &s;carcely have believed exi&s;ted, &s;uch as I weep to find in a relation. O! what a contra&s;t does her char|acter pre&s;ent to that of my beloved father; while envy and low cunning form the chief traits of hers, his was di&s;tingui&s;hed by benevolence and philo&s;ophic wi&s;dom! But now, let me only re|member, if po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he is unfortunate."</P>
<P>Emily threw her veil over her, and went down to walk upon the ramparts, the only walk, indeed which was open to her, though &s;he often wi&s;hed, that &s;he might be permitted to ramble among the woods below, and &s;till more, that &s;he might &s;ometimes ex|plore the &s;ublime &s;cenes of the &s;urrounding country. But, as Montoni would not &s;uffer her to pa&s;s the gates of the ca&s;tle, &s;he tried to be contented with the romantic views &s;he beheld from the walls. The pea&s;ants, who had been employed on the fortifica|tions, had left their work, and the ramparts were &s;ilent and &s;oli|tary. Their lonely appearance, together with the gloom of a lowering &s;ky, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the mu&s;ings of her mind, and threw over it a kind of melancholy tranquillity, &s;uch as &s;he often loved to in|dulge. She turned to ob&s;erve a fine effect of the &s;un, as his rays, &s;uddenly &s;treaming from behind a heavy cloud, lighted up the we&s;t towers of the ca&s;tle, while the re&s;t of the edifice was in deep &s;hade, except, that, through a lofty gothic arch, adjoining the tower, which led to another terrace, the beams darted in full &s;plendour, and &s;hewed the three &s;trangers &s;he had ob&s;erved in the morning. Perceiving them, &s;he &s;tarted, and a momentary fear came over her, as &s;he looked up the long rampart, and &s;aw no other per&s;ons. While &s;he he&s;itated, they approached. The gate at the end of the terrace, whither they were advancing, &s;he knew, was always locked, and &s;he could not depart by the op|po&s;ite extremity, without meeting them; but, before &s;he pa&s;&s;ed them, &s;he ha&s;tily drew a thin veil over her face, which did, in|deed, but ill conceal her beauty. They looked earne&s;tly at her, and &s;poke to each other in had Italian, of which &s;he caught only a few words; but the fiercene&s;s of their countenances, now that &s;he was near enough to di&s;criminate them, &s;truck her yet more

that the wild &s;ingularity of their air and dre&s;s had formerly none. It was the countenance and figure of him, who walked between the other two, that chiefly &s;eized her attention, which expre&s;&s;ed a &s;ullen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aughtine&s;s and a kind of dark watchful villainy, that gate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thrill of horror to her heart. All this was &s;o legibly written on his features, as to be &s;een by a &s;ingle glance, for &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the group &s;wiftly, and her timid eyes &s;carcely re&s;ted on them a moment. Heaving reached the terrace, &s;he &s;topped, and perceived the &s;trangers &s;tanding in the &s;hadow of one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, gazing after her, and &s;eemingly, by their action, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation. She immediately left the rampart, and retired to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> apartment.</P>
<P>In the evening, Montoni &s;at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, carou&s;ing with his gue&s;ts in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> chamber. His recent triumph over Count Morano, on perhaps, &s;ome other circum&s;tance, contributed to elevate his &s;pir|its to an unu&s;ual height. He filled the goblet often, and gave a loo&s;e to merriment and talk. The gaiety of Cavigni, on the contrary, was &s;omewhat clouded by anxiety. He kept a watch|ful eye upon Verezzi, whom, with the utmo&s;t-difficulty, he had hitherto re&s;trained from exa&s;perating Montoni further again&s;t Morano, by a mention of his late taunting words.</P>
<P>One of the company exultingly recurred to the event of the preceding evening. Verezzi's eyes &s;parkled. The mention of Morano led to that of Emily, of whom they were all profu&s;e in the prai&s;e, except Montoni, who &s;at &s;ilent, and then interrupted the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants had withdrawn, Montoni and his friend entered into clo&s;e conver&s;ation, which was &s;ometimes checked by the ira&s;cible temper of Verezzi, but in which Montoni di&s;|played his con&s;cious &s;uperiority, by that dici&s;ive look and man|ner which always accompanied the vigour of his thought, and to which mo&s;t of his companions &s;ubmitted, as to a power, that they had no right to que&s;tion, though of each other's &s;elf impor|tance they were jealou&s;ly &s;crupulous. Amid&s;t this conver&s;ation, one of them imprudently introduced again the name of Mo|rano; and Verezzi, now more heated by wine, di&s;regard|ed the expre&s;&s;ive looks of Cavigni, and gave &s;ome dark hints of what had pa&s;&s;ed on the preceding night. The&s;e, however, Mon|toni did not appear to under&s;tand, for he continued &s;ilent in his chair, without di&s;covering any emotion, while, the choler of Verezzi increa&s;ing with the apparent in&s;en&s;ibility of Montoni, he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at length told the &s;ugge&s;tion of Morano, that this ca&s;tle did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> lawfully belong to him, and that he would not willingly leave another murder on his con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="029378_0149_0FE0822EB2834A28">
"Am I to be in&s;ulted at my own table, and by my own friends?" &s;aid Montoni, with a countenance pale in anger. "Why are the words of that madman repeated to me?" Verezzi who had expected to hear Montoni's indignation poured forth again&s;t Morano, and an&s;wered by thanks to him&s;elf, looked with a&s;toni&s;hment at Cavigni, who enjoyed his confu&s;ion. "Can you be weak enough to credit the a&s;&s;ertions of a madman?" rejoin|ed Montoni, or, what is the &s;ame thing, a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;pirit of vengeance? But he has &s;ucceeded too well; you believe what he &s;aid."</P>
<P>"Signor," &s;aid Verezzi, "we believe only what we know."&mdash;"How!" interrupted Montoni, &s;ternly: produce your proof."</P>
<P>"We believe only what we know," repeated Verezzi, "and we know nothing of what Morano a&s;&s;erts." Montoni &s;eemed to recover him&s;elf. "I am ha&s;ty, my friends," &s;aid he, "with re&s;pect to my honour; no man &s;hall que&s;tion it with impunity, you did not mean to que&s;tion it. The&s;e fooli&s;h words are not worth your remembrance, or my re&s;entment. Verezzi, here is to your fir&s;t exploit."</P>
<P>"Succe&s;s to your fir&s;t exploit," re-echoed the whole company.</P>
<P>"Noble Signor," replied Verezzi, glad to find he had e&s;caped Montoni's re&s;entment, "with my good will, you &s;hould build your ramparts of gold."</P>
<P>"Pa&s;s the goblet," cried Montoni. "We will drink to Sig|nora St. Aubert," &s;aid Cavigni. "By your leave, we will fir&s;t drink to the lady of the ca&s;tle," &s;aid Bertolini&mdash;Montoni was &s;ilent. "To the lady of the ca&s;tle," &s;aid his gue&s;ts. He bowed his head.</P>
<P>"It much &s;urpri&s;es me, Signor," &s;aid Bertolini, "that you have &s;o long neglected this ca&s;tle; it is a noble edifice."</P>
<P>"It &s;uits our purpo&s;e," replied Montoni, "and <HI>is</HI> a noble edi|fice. You know not, it &s;eems, by what mi&s;chance it came to me."</P>
<P>"It was a lucky mi&s;chance, be it what it may, Signor," replied Bertolini, &s;miling. "I would, that one &s;o lucky had befallen me."</P>
<P>Montoni looked gravely at him. "If you will attend to what I &s;ay," he re&s;umed, "you &s;hall hear the &s;tory."</P>
<P>The countenances of Bertolini and Verezzi expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome|thing more than curio&s;ity; Cavigni, who &s;eemed to feel none, had probably heard the relation before.</P>
<P>"It is now near twenty years," &s;aid Montoni, "&s;ince this ca&s;tle came into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I inherit it by the female line. The lady, my predece&s;&s;or, was only di&s;tantly related to me; I am the la&s;t of her family. She was beautiful and rich; I wooed her;
<PB N="72" REF="029378_0150_0FE08234F76DC9F0">
but her heart was fixed upon another, and &s;he rejected me. It is probable, however, that &s;he was her&s;elf rejected of the per&s;on, whoever he might be, on whom &s;he be&s;towed her favour, for a deep and &s;ettled melancholy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her; and I have rea&s;on to believe &s;he put a period to her own life. I was not at the ca&s;tle at the time; but, as there are &s;ome &s;ingular and my&s;te|rious circum&s;tances attending that event. I &s;hall repeat them."</P>
<P>"Repeat them!" &s;aid a voice.</P>
<P>Montoni was &s;ilent; the gue&s;ts looked at each other, to know who &s;poke; but they perceived, that each was making the &s;ame inquiry. Montoni, at length, recovering him&s;elf, "We are overheard," &s;aid he: "we will fini&s;h this &s;ubject another time. Pa&s;s the goblet."</P>
<P>The cavaliers looked round the wide chamber.</P>
<P>"Here is no per&s;on, but our&s;elves," &s;aid Verezzi: "pray, Signor, proceed."</P>
<P>"Did you hear any thing?" &s;aid Montoni.</P>
<P>"We did," &s;aid Bertolini.</P>
<P>"It could be only fancy," &s;aid Verezzi, looking round again. "We &s;ee no per&s;on be&s;ides our&s;elves; and the &s;ound I thought I heard &s;eemed within the room. Pray, Signor, go on."</P>
<P>Montoni pau&s;ed a moment, and then proceeded in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> voice, while the cavaliers drew nearer to attend.</P>
<P>"Ye are to know, Signors, that the Lady Laurentini had for &s;ome months &s;hewn &s;ymptoms of a dejected mind, nay, of a di&s;turbed imagination. Her mood was very unequal; &s;ome|times &s;he was &s;unk in calm melancholy, and, at others, as I have been told, &s;he betrayed all the &s;ymptoms of frantic mad|ne&s;s. It was one night in the month of October, after &s;he had recovered from one of tho&s;e &s;its of exce&s;s, and had &s;unk again into her u&s;ual melancholy, that &s;he retired alone to her chamber, and forbade all interruption. It was the chamber at the end of the corridor, Signors, where we had the affray, la&s;t night. From that hour, &s;he was &s;een no more."</P>
<P>"How! &s;een no more!" &s;aid Bertolini, "was not her body &s;ound in the chamber?"</P>
<P>"Were her remains never found?" cried the re&s;t of the com|pany altogether.</P>
<P>"Never!" replied Montoni.</P>
<P>"What rea&s;ons were there to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he de&s;troyed her&s;elf, then?" &s;aid Bertolini.&mdash;"Aye, what rea&s;ons?" &s;aid Verezzi.&mdash;"How happened it, that her remains were never found? Al|though &s;he killed her&s;elf, &s;he could not bury her&s;elf," Montoni

looked indignantly at Verezzi, who began to apologize. "Your pardon, Signor," &s;aid he: "I did not con&s;ider, that the lady was your relative, when I &s;poke of her &s;o lightly."</P>
<P>Montoni accepted the apology.</P>
<P>"But the Signor will oblige us with the rea&s;ons, which urged him to believe, that the lady committed &s;uicide."</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e I will explain hereafter," &s;aid Montoni: "at pre|&s;ent let me relate a mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance. This con|ver&s;ation goes no further, Signors. Li&s;ten, then, to what I am going to &s;ay."</P>
<P>"Li&s;ten!" &s;aid a voice.</P>
<P>They were all again &s;ilent, and the countenance of Montoni changed. "This is no illu&s;ion of the fancy," &s;aid Cavigni, at length breaking the profound &s;ilence.&mdash;"No," &s;aid Bertolini; "I heard it my&s;elf, now. Yet here is no per&s;on in the room but our&s;elves!"</P>
<P>"This is very extraordinary," &s;aid Montoni, &s;uddenly ri&s;ing. "This is not to be borne; here is &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;ome trick. I will knew what it means."</P>
<P>All the company ro&s;e from their chairs in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"It is very odd!" &s;aid Bertolini. "Here is really no &s;tran|ger in the room. If it is a trick, Signor, you will do well to puni&s;h the author o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it &s;everely."</P>
<P>"A trick! what el&s;e can it be?" &s;aid Cavigni, affecting a laugh.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants were now &s;ummoned, and the chamber was &s;earched, but no per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> found. The &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ter|nation of the company <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Montoni was di&s;compo&s;ed.

His gue&s;ts were equally ready to quit the apartment but the &s;ubject had rou&s;ed their curio&s;i|ty, and they entreated Montoni to withdraw to another cham|ber, and fini&s;h it; no entreaties could, however, prevail with him.

<P>WE now return to Valancourt, who, it may be remem|bered, remained at Tholou&s;e, &s;ometime after the departure of Emily, re&s;tle&s;s and mi&s;erable. Each morrow, that approached he de&s;igned &s;hould carry him from thence; yet to-morrow and to-morrow came, and &s;till &s;aw him lingering in the &s;cene of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> former happine&s;s. He could not immediately tear him&s;elf from the &s;pot, where he had been accu&s;tomed to conver&s;e with Emily, or from the objects they had viewed together, which appeared to him memorials of her affection, as well as a kind of &s;urety for its faithfulne&s;s; and, next to the pain of bidding her adieu, was that of leaving the &s;cenes, which &s;o powerfully awakened her image. Sometimes he had bribed a &s;ervant, who had been left in the care of Madame Montoni's chateau, to permit him to vi&s;it the gardens, and there he would wander, for hours togeth|er, wrapt in a melancholy, not unplea&s;ing. The terrace and the pavilion at the end of it, where he had taken leave of Emily, on the eve of her departure from Tholou&s;e, were his mo&s;t favourite haunts. There, as he walked, or leaned from the window of the building, he would endeavour to recollect all &s;he had &s;aid, on that night; to catch the tones of her voice, as they faintly vibrated on his memory, and to remember the exact expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, which &s;ometimes came &s;uddenly to his fan|cy, like a vi&s;ion; that beautiful countenance, which awaken|ed, as by in&s;tantaneous magic, all the tenderne&s;s of his heart and &s;eemed to tell with irre&s;i&s;tible eloquence&mdash;that he had lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> her for ever! At the&s;e moments, his hurried &s;teps would have di&s;covered to a &s;pectator the de&s;pair of his heart. The char|acter of Montoni, &s;uch as he had received from hints, and &s;uch as his fears repre&s;ented it, would ri&s;e to his view, together with all the dangers it &s;eemed to threaten to Emily and to his love. He blamed him&s;elf, that he had not urged the&s;e more forcibly to her, while it might have been in his power to detain her, and that he had &s;uffered an ab&s;urd and criminal delicacy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he termed it, to conquer &s;o &s;oon the rea&s;onable arguments he had oppo&s;ed to this journey. Any evil that might have attended their marriage, &s;eemed &s;o inferior to tho&s;e, which now threatened, their love, or even to the &s;ufferings, that ab&s;ence occa&s;ioned,
<PB N="75" REF="029378_0151_0FE08242C4929FB0">
that he wondered how he could have cea&s;ed to urge his &s;uit, till he had convinced her of its propriety and he would certainly now have followed her to Italy, if he could have been &s;pared from his regiment for &s;o long a journey. His regiment, indeed, &s;oon reminded him, that he had other duties to attend, than tho&s;e of love.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after his arrival at his brother's hou&s;e, he was &s;ummoned to join his brother officers, and he accompanied a battalion to Paris; where a &s;cene of novelty and gaiety opened upon him, &s;uch as, till then, he had only a faint idea of. But gaiety di&s;gu&s;ted, and company fatigued, his &s;ick mind; and he became an object of uncea&s;ing raillery to his companions, from whom, whenever he could &s;teal an opportunity, he e&s;caped, to think of Emily. The &s;cenes around him, however, and the company with whom he was obliged to mingle, engaged his at|tention, though they failed to amu&s;e his fancy, and thus gradu|ally weakened the habit of yielding to lamentation, till it ap|peared le&s;s a duty to his love to indulge it. Among his brother officers were many, who added to the ordinary character of a French &s;oldier's gaiety &s;ome of tho&s;e fa&s;cinating qualities, which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and &s;ometimes even &s;often the features of vice into &s;miles. To the&s;e men the re&s;erved and thoughtful manners of Valancourt were a kind of tacit cen&s;ure on their own, for which they rallied him when pre&s;ent, and plotted again&s;t him when ab&s;ent; they gloried in the thought of redu|cing him to their own level, and, con&s;idering it to be a &s;pirited frolic, determined to accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P>Valancourt was a &s;tranger to the gradual progre&s;s of &s;cheme and intrigue, again&s;t which he could not be on his guard. He had not been accu&s;tomed to receive ridicule, and he could ill endure its &s;ting; he re&s;ented it, and this only drew upon him a louder laugh. To e&s;cape from &s;uch &s;cenes, he fled into &s;olitude, and there the image of Emily met him, and revived the pangs of love and de&s;pair. He then &s;ought to renew tho&s;e ta&s;teful &s;tudies, which had been the delight of his early years; but his mind had lo&s;t the tranquillity, which is nece&s;&s;ary for their enjoy|ment. To forget him&s;elf and the grief and anxiety, which the idea of her recalled, he would quit his &s;olitude, and again min|gle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the crowd&mdash;glad of a temporary relief, and rejoicing to &s;natch amu&s;ement for the moment.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed weeks after weeks, time gradually &s;oftening his &s;orrow, and habit &s;trengthening his de&s;ire of amu&s;ement, till the &s;cenes around him &s;eemed to awaken into a new character, and Valancourt, to have fallen among them from the clouds.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="029378_0152_0FE08248A937AE78">
His figure and addre&s;s made him a welcome vi&s;itor, wherever he had been introduced, and he &s;oon frequented the mo&s;t gay and fa&s;hionable circles of Paris. Among the&s;e, was the a&s;&s;embly of the Counte&s;s Lacleur, a woman of eminent beauty and cap|tivating manners. She had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;pring of youth, but her wit prolonged the triumph of its reign, and they mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ted the fame of each other; for tho&s;e, who were charmed by her loveline&s;s, &s;poke with enthu&s;ia&s;m of her talents; and others, who admired her playful imagination, declared, that her per&s;onal gra|ces were unrivalled. But her imagination was merely playful, and her wit, if &s;uch it could be called, was brilliant, rather than ju&s;t; it dazzled, and its fallacy e&s;caped the detection of the mo|ment; for the accents, in which &s;he pronounced it, and the &s;mile that accompanied them, were, a &s;pell upon the judgment of the auditors. Her <HI>petits &s;oupers</HI> were the mo&s;t ta&s;teful of any in Pa|ris, and were frequented by many of the &s;econd cla&s;s of literati. She was fond of mu&s;ic, was her&s;elf a &s;cientific performer, and had frequently concerts at her hou&s;e. Valancourt, who pa&s;&s;ion|ately loved mu&s;ic, and who &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the&s;e concerts, admired her execution, but remembered with a &s;igh the eloquent &s;implicity of Emily's &s;ongs and the natural expre&s;&s;ion of her man|ner, which waited not to be approved by the judgment, but found their way at once to the heart.</P>
<P>Madame <HI>La Comte&s;&s;e</HI> had often deep play at her hou&s;e, which &s;he affected to re&s;train, but &s;ecretly encouraged; and it was well known among her friends, that the &s;plendour of her e&s;tabli&s;h|ment was chiefly &s;upplied from the profits of her tables. But her <HI>petits &s;oupers</HI> were the mo&s;t charming imaginable! Here were all the delicacies of the four quarters of the world, all the wit and the lighter efforts of genius, all the graces of conver&s;a|tion&mdash;the &s;miles of beauty, and the charms of mu&s;ic; and Va|lancourt pa&s;&s;ed his plea&s;ante&s;t, as well as mo&s;t dangerous hours in the&s;e parties.</P>
<P>His brother, who remained with his family in Ga&s;cony, had contented him&s;elf with giving him letters of introduction to &s;uch of his relations, re&s;iding at Paris, as the latter was not already known to. All the&s;e were per&s;ons of &s;ome di&s;tinction; and, as neither the per&s;on, mind, or manners of Valancourt the youn|ger threatened to di&s;grace their alliance, they received him with as much kindne&s;s as their nature, hardened by uninterrupted pro&s;perity, would admit of; but their attentions did not extend to acts of real friend&s;hip; for they were too much occupied by their own pur&s;uits, to feel any intere&s;t in his; and thus he was
<PB N="77" REF="029378_0152_0FE08248A937AE78">
&s;et down in the mid&s;t of Paris, in the pride of youth, with an open, un&s;u&s;picious temper and ardent affections, without one friend to warn him of the dangers, to which he was expo&s;ed. Emily, who, had &s;he been pre&s;ent, would have &s;aved him from the&s;e evils by awakening his heart, and engageing him in worthy pur|&s;uits, now only increa&s;ed his danger;&mdash;it was to lo&s;e the grief, which the remembrance of her occa&s;ioned, that he fir&s;t &s;ought amu&s;ement; and for this end he pur&s;ued it, till habit made it an object of ab&s;tract intere&s;t.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a Marchione&s;s Champfort, a young widow, at who&s;e a&s;&s;emblies he pa&s;&s;ed much of his time. She was hand|&s;ome, &s;till more artful, gay and fond of intrigue. The &s;ociety, which &s;he drew round her, was le&s;s elegant and more vicious, than that of the Counte&s;s Lacleur: but, as &s;he had addre&s;s enough to throw a veil, though but a &s;light one, over the wor&s;t parts of her character, &s;he was &s;till vi&s;ited by many per&s;ons of what is called di&s;tinction. Valancourt was introduced to her parties by two of his brother officers, who&s;e late ridicule he had now forgiven &s;o far, that he could &s;ometimes join in the laugh, which a mention his former manners would renew.</P>
<P>The gaiety of the mo&s;t &s;plendid court in Europe, the magni|ficence of the palaces, entertainments, and equipages, that &s;ur|rounded him&mdash;all con&s;pired to dazzle his imagination, and re|animate his &s;pirits, and the example and maxims of his military a&s;&s;ociates to delude his mind. Emily's image, indeed, &s;till lived there; but it was no longer the friend, the monitor, that &s;aved him from him&s;elf, and, to which he retired to weep the &s;weet, yet melancholy tears of tenderne&s;s. When he had recour&s;e to it, it a&s;&s;umed a countenance of mild reproach, that wrung his &s;oul and called forth tears of unmixed mi&s;ery; his only e&s;cape from which was to forget the object of it, and he endeavoured, there|fore, to think of Emily as &s;eldom as he could.</P>
<P>Thus dangerou&s;ly circum&s;tanced was Valancourt, at the time, when Emily was &s;uffering at Venice, from the per&s;ecuting ad|dre&s;&s;es of Count Morano, and the unju&s;t authority of Montoni; at which period we leave him.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LEAVING the gay &s;cenes of Paris, we return to tho&s;e of the gloomy Apennine, where Emily's thoughts were &s;till faithful to Valancourt. Looking to him as to her only hope, &s;he recollect|ed, with jealous exactne&s;s, every a&s;&s;urance and every proof &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed of his affection; read again and again the letters &s;he had received from him; weighed, with inten&s;e anxiety, the force of every word, that &s;poke of his attachment; and dried her tears, as &s;he tru&s;ted in his truth.</P>
<P>Montoni, meanwhile, had made &s;trict inquiry, concerning the &s;trange circum&s;tance of his alarm, without obtaining information; and was, at length, obliged to account for it by the rea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;ition, that it was a mi&s;chievous trick played off by one of his dome&s;tics. His di&s;agreements with Madame Montoni, on the &s;ubject of her &s;ettlements, were now more frequent than ever; he even confined her entirely to her own apartment, and did not &s;cruple to threaten her with much greater &s;everity, &s;hould &s;he per&s;evere in a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, had &s;he con&s;ulted it, would now have perplexed her in the choice of a conduct to be adopted. It would have point|ed out the danger of irritating by further oppo&s;ition a man, &s;uch as Montoni had proved him&s;elf to be, and to who&s;e power &s;he had &s;o entirely committed her&s;elf; and it would al&s;o have told her, of what extreme importance to her future comfort it was, to re|&s;erve for her&s;elf tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which would enable her to live independently of Montoni &s;hould &s;he ever e&s;cape from his im|mediate control. But &s;he was directed by a more deci&s;ive guide than rea&s;on&mdash;the &s;pirit of revenge, which urged her to oppo&s;e violence to violence, and ob&s;tinacy to ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>Wholly confined to the &s;olitude of her apartment, &s;he was now reduced to &s;olicit the &s;ociety &s;he &s;o lately rejected; for Emily was the only per&s;on except Annette, with whom &s;he was per|mitted to conver&s;e.</P>
<P>Generou&s;ly anxious for her peace, Emily, therefore tried to per&s;uade, when &s;he could not convince, and &s;ought by every gentle means to induce her to forbear that a&s;perity of reply, which &s;o greatly irritated Montoni. The pride of her aunt
<PB N="79" REF="029378_0153_0FE082579884A450">
did &s;ometimes &s;often to the &s;oothing voice of Emily, and there even were moments when &s;he regarded her affectionate atten|tions with good will.</P>
<P>The &s;cenes of terrible contention, to which Emily was fre|quently compelled to be witne&s;s, exhau&s;ted her &s;pirits more than any circum&s;tances, that had occurred &s;ince her departure from Tholou&s;e. The gentlene&s;s and goodne&s;s of her parents, together with the &s;cenes of her early happine&s;s, often &s;tole on her mind, like the vi&s;ions of a higher world; while the characters and circum&s;tances, now pa&s;&s;ing beneath her eye, excited both ter|ror and &s;urpri&s;e. She could &s;carcely have imagined, that pa&s;|&s;ions &s;o fierce and &s;o various, as tho&s;e which Montoni exhibited, could have been concentrated in one individual; yet what more &s;urpri&s;ed her, was, that on great occa&s;ions, he could bend the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were, to the cau&s;e of his intere&s;t, and gen|erally could di&s;gui&s;e in his countenance their operation on his mind; but &s;he had &s;een him too often, when he had thought it un|nece&s;&s;ary to conceal his nature, to be deceived on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Her pre&s;ent life appeared like the dream of a di&s;tempered imag|ination, or like one of tho&s;e frightful fictions, in which the wild genius of the poets &s;ometimes delighted. Reflection brought only regret, and anticipation terror. How often did &s;he wi&s;h to "&s;teal the lark's wing, and mount the &s;wifte&s;t gale," that Languedoc and repo&s;e might once more be hers!</P>
<P>Of Count Morano's health &s;he made frequent inquiry; but Annette heard only vague reports of his danger, and that his &s;urgeon had &s;aid he would never leave the cottage alive; while Emily could not but be &s;hocked to think, that &s;he, however in|nocently, might be the means of his death: and Annette who did not fail to ob&s;erve her emotion, interpreted it in her own way. But a circum&s;tance &s;oon occurred, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> entirely withdrew An|nette's attention from this &s;ubject, and awakened the &s;urpri&s;e and curio&s;ity &s;o natural to her. Coming one day to Emily's apart|ment, with a countenance full of importance, "What can all this mean, ma'am&s;elle?" &s;aid &s;he. "Would I was once &s;afe in Languedoc again, they &s;hould never catch me going on my travels any more! I mu&s;t think it a fine thing, truely, to come abroad, and &s;ee foreign parts! I little thought I was coming to be catched up in an old ca&s;tle, among &s;uch dreary mountains, with the chance of being murdered, or what is as good, having my throat cut!"</P>
<P>"What can all this mean, indeed, Annette?" &s;aid Emily, in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="029378_0154_0FE0825C496F0A00">
"Aye, ma'am&s;elle, you may look &s;urpri&s;ed; but you won't believe it, perhaps, till they have murdered you, too. You would not believe about the gho&s;t I told you of, though I &s;hew|ed you the very place, where it u&s;ed to appear!&mdash;You will be|lieve nothing, ma'am&s;elle."</P>
<P>"Not till you &s;peak more rea&s;onably, Annette; for Heaven's &s;ake explain your meaning. You &s;poke of murder!"</P>
<P>"Aye, ma'am&s;elle, they are coming to murder us all, per|haps; but what &s;ignifies explaining?&mdash;you will not believe."</P>
<P>Emily again de&s;ired her to relate what &s;he had &s;een or heard.</P>
<P>"O, I have &s;een enough, ma'am, and heard too much, as Ludovico can prove. Poor &s;oul! they will murder him, too! I little thought, when he &s;ung tho&s;e &s;weet ver&s;es under my lat|tice, at Venice!"&mdash;Emily looked impatient and di&s;plea&s;ed.&mdash;"Well, ma'am&s;elle, as I was &s;aying, the&s;e preparations about the ca&s;tle, and the&s;e &s;trange looking people, that are calling here every day, and the Signor's cruel u&s;age of my lady, and his odd goings on&mdash;all the&s;e, as I told Ludovico, can bode no good.&mdash;And he bid me hold my tongue. So, &s;ays I, the Signor's &s;trangely altered, Ludovico, in this gloomy ca&s;tle, to what he was in France; there all &s;o gay! Nobody &s;o gallant to my lady, then; and he could &s;mile, too, upon a poor &s;ervant, &s;ometimes, and jeer her, too, good-naturedly enough. I remember once, when he &s;aid to me, as I was going out of my lady's dre&s;&s;ing room&mdash;Annette, &s;ays he&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Never mind what the Signor &s;aid," interrupted Emily; "but tell me, at once, the circum&s;tance, which has thus alarmed you."</P>
<P>"Aye, ma'am&s;elle," rejoined Annette, "that is ju&s;t what Lu|dovico &s;aid: &s;ays he, Never mind what the Signor &s;ays to you. So I told him what I thought about the Signor. He is &s;o &s;trangely altered, &s;aid I: for now he is &s;o haughty, and &s;o com|manding, and &s;o &s;harp with my lady; and, if he meets one, he'll &s;carcely look at one, unle&s;s it be to frown. So much the better, &s;ays Ludovico, &s;o much the better. And to tell you the truth, ma'am&s;elle, I thought this was a very ill-natured &s;peech of Lu|dovico: but I went on. And then, &s;ays I, he is always knit|ting his brows; and if one &s;peaks to him, he does not hear; and then he &s;its up coun&s;elling &s;o, of a night, with the other Signors&mdash;there they are, till long pa&s;t midnight di&s;cour&s;ing to|gether! Aye, but &s;ays Ludovico, you don't know what they are coun&s;elling about. No, &s;aid I, but I can gue&s;s&mdash;it is about my young lady. Upon that, Ludovico bur&s;t out a laughing, quite

loud; &s;o he put me in a huff, for I did not like that either I, or you ma'am&s;elle, &s;hould be laughed at; and I turned away quick, but he &s;topped me. 'Don't be affronted. Annette.' &s;aid he, 'but I cannot help laughing;' and with that he laughed again. 'What!' &s;ays he, do you think the Signors &s;it up, night after night, only to coun&s;el about thy young lady! No, no, there is &s;omething more in the wind than that. And the&s;e repairs about the ca&s;tle, and the&s;e preparations about the ramparts&mdash;they are not making about young ladies.' Why &s;urely, &s;aid I, the Signor, my ma&s;ter, is not going to make war? 'Make war!' &s;aid Lu|dovico, 'what, upon the mountains and the woods? for here is no living &s;oul to make war upon, that I &s;ee.'</P>
<P>"What are the&s;e preparations for, then? &s;aid I; why &s;urely nobody is coming to take away my ma&s;ter's ca&s;tle! 'Then there are &s;o many ill looking fellows coming to the ca&s;tle every day.' &s;ays Ludovico, without an&s;wering my que&s;tion, 'and the Signor &s;ees them all, and talks with them all, and they all &s;tay in the neighbourhood! By holy St. Marco! &s;ome of them are the mo&s;t cut-throat-looking dogs I ever &s;et my eyes upon.'</P>
<P>"I a&s;ked Ludovico again, if he thought they were coming to take away my ma&s;ter's ca&s;tle; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, he did not think they were, but he did not know for certain. 'Then, ye&s;terday,' &s;aid he, but you mu&s;t not tell this, ma'am&s;elle, 'ye&s;terday, a party of the&s;e men came, and left all their hor&s;es in the ca&s;tle &s;tables, where, it &s;eems, they are to &s;tay, for the Signor ordered them all to be entertained with the be&s;t provender in the manger; but the men are, mo&s;t of them; in the neighbouring cottages.'</P>
<P>"So, ma'am&s;elle, I came to tell you all this, for I never heard any thing &s;o &s;trange in my life. But what can the&s;e ill-looking men be come about, if it is not to murder us? And the Sig|nor knows this, or why &s;hould he be &s;o civil to them? And why &s;hould he fortify the ca&s;tle, and coun&s;el &s;o much with the other Signors, and be &s;o thoughtful?"</P>
<P>"Is this all you have to tell, Annette?" &s;aid Emily. "Have you heard nothing el&s;e that alarms you?"</P>
<P>"Nothing el&s;e, ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid Annette; "why, is not this enough?" "Quite enough for my patience. Annette, but not quite enough to convince me we are all to be murdered, though I acknowledge here is &s;ufficient food for curio&s;ity." She forbore to &s;peak her apprehen&s;ions, becau&s;e &s;he would not en|courage Annette's wild terrors; but the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the ca&s;tle both &s;urpri&s;ed, and alarmed her. Annette, having told her tale, left the chamber, on the wing for new wonders.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="029378_0155_0FE0826A78968AB0">
In the evening, Emily had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome melancholy hours with Madame Montoni, and was retiring to re&s;t, when &s;he was alarm|ed by a &s;trange and loud knocking at her chamber door, and then a heavy weight fell again&s;t it, that almo&s;t bur&s;t it open. She called to know who was there, and receiving no an&s;wer, repeated the call; but a chilling &s;ilence followed. It occur|red to her&mdash;for, at this moment, &s;he could not rea&s;on on the probability of circum&s;tances&mdash;that &s;ome one of the &s;trangers, lately arrived at the ca&s;tle, had di&s;covered her apartment, and was come with &s;uch intent, as their looks rendered too po&s;&s;ible&mdash;to rob, perhaps to murder, her. The moment &s;he admitted this po&s;&s;ibility, terror &s;upplied the place of conviction, and a kind of in&s;tinctive remembrance of her remote &s;ituation from the family heightened it to a degree, that almo&s;t overcame her &s;en&s;es.&mdash;She looked at the door, which led to the &s;tairca&s;e, expecting to &s;ee it open, and li&s;tening, in fearful &s;ilence, for a return of the noi&s;e, till &s;he began to think it had proceeded from this door, and a wi&s;h of e&s;caping through the oppo&s;ite one ru&s;hed up|on her mind. She went to the gallery door, and then, fearing to open it, le&s;t &s;ome per&s;on might be &s;ilently lurking for her without, &s;he &s;topped, but with her eyes fixed in expectation up|on the oppo&s;ite door of the &s;tairca&s;e. As thus &s;he &s;tood, &s;he heard a faint breathing near her, and became convinced, that &s;ome per&s;on was on the other &s;ide of the door, which was alrea|dy lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ked. She &s;ought for other fa&s;tening, but there was none.</P>
<P>While &s;he yet li&s;tened, the breathing was di&s;tinctly heard, and her terror was not &s;oothed, when, looking round her wide and lonely chamber, &s;he again con&s;idered her remote &s;ituation. As &s;he &s;tood he&s;itating whether to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the continuance of the &s;tillne&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed her; and her &s;pirits would have revived, had &s;he not continued to hear the faint breathing, that convinced her; the per&s;on, whoever it was, had not quitted the door.</P>
<P>At length, worn out with anxiety, &s;he determined to call loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from her ca&s;ement, and was advancing to it, when, whether the terror of her mind gave her ideal &s;ounds, or that real ones did come, &s;he thought foot&s;teps were a&s;cending the private &s;tairca&s;e; and, expecting to &s;ee its door unclo&s;e, &s;he forgot all other cau&s;e of alarm, and retreated towards the corridor. Here &s;he endeavoured to make her e&s;cape, but, on opening the door, was very near falling over a per&s;on, who lay on the floor without. She &s;creamed, and would have pa&s;&s;ed, but her trembling frame refu&s;ed to &s;upport her; and the mo|ment, in which &s;he leaned again&s;t the wall of the gallery, allow|ed
<PB N="83" REF="029378_0155_0FE0826A78968AB0">
her lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the figure before her, and to recognize the features of Annette. Fear in&s;tantly yielded to &s;urpri&s;e. She &s;poke in vain to the poor girl, who remained &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor, and then, lo&s;ing all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own weakne&s;s, hurried to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>When Annette recovered, &s;he was helped by Emily into the chamber, but was &s;till unable to &s;peak, and looked round her, as if her eyes followed &s;ome per&s;on in the room. Emily tried to &s;ooth her di&s;turbed &s;pirits, and forbore at pre&s;ent, to a&s;k her any que&s;tions; but the faculty of &s;peech was never long withheld from Annette, and &s;he explained, in broken &s;entences, and in her tedious way, the occa&s;ion of her di&s;order. She affirmed, and with a &s;olemnity of conviction, that almo&s;t &s;taggered the incre|dulity of Emily, that &s;he had &s;een an apparition, as &s;he was pa&s;&s;|ing to her bedroom, through the corridor.</P>
<P>"I had heard &s;trange &s;tories of that chamber before," &s;aid Annette: "but as it was &s;o near yours, ma'am&s;elle, I would not tell them to you, becau&s;e they would frighten you. The &s;ervants had told me, often and often, that it was haunted, and, that was the rea&s;on why it was &s;hut up: nay, for that matter, why the whole &s;tring of the&s;e rooms, here, are &s;hut up. I quak|ed whenever I went by, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, I did &s;ometimes think I heard odd noi&s;es within it. But, as I &s;aid, as I was pa&s;&s;ing along the corridor, and not thinking a word about the matter, or even of the &s;trange voice that the Signors heard the other night, all of a &s;udden comes a great light, and, looking behind me, there was a tall figure, (I &s;aw it as plainly ma'am&s;elle, as I &s;ee you at this moment) a tall figure gliding along (Oh! I can|not de&s;cribe how!) into the room that is always &s;hut up, and nobody has the key of it but the Signor, and the door &s;hut directly.</P>
<P>"Then it doubtle&s;s was the Signor," &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"O no, ma'am&s;elle, it could not be him, for I left him bu&s;y a quarrelling in my lady's dre&s;&s;ing room!"</P>
<P>"You bring me &s;trange tales, Annette," &s;aid Emily: "it was but this morning, that you would have terrified me with the apprehen&s;ion of murder; and now you would per&s;uade me, you have &s;een a gho&s;t! The&s;e wonderful &s;tories come too quickly."</P>
<P>"Nay, ma'am&s;elle, I will &s;ay no more, only, if I had not been frightened, I &s;hould not have fainted dead away, &s;o. I ran as fa&s;t as I could, to get to your door; but what was wor&s;t of all, I could not call out; then I thought &s;omething mu&s;t be &s;trangely the matter with me, and directly I dropt down."</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="029378_0156_0FE0826F245358D0">
"Was it the chamber where the black veil hangs?" &s;aid Emily. "O! no, ma'am&s;elle, it was one nearer to this. What &s;hall I do, to get to my room? I would not go out into the corridor again, for the whole world!" Emily, who&s;e &s;pirits had been &s;everely &s;hocked, and who, therefore, did not like the thought of pa&s;&s;ing the night alone, told her &s;he might &s;leep where &s;he was. "O, no, ma'am&s;elle," replied Annette, "I would not &s;leep in the room now, for a thou&s;and &s;equins!"</P>
<P>Wearied and di&s;appointed, Emily fir&s;t ridiculed, though &s;he &s;hared, her fears, and then tried to &s;ooth them; but neither at|tempt &s;ucceeded, and the girl per&s;i&s;ted in believing and affirm|ing, that what &s;he had &s;een was nothing human. It was not till &s;ometime after Emily had recovered her compo&s;ure, that &s;he recollected the &s;teps &s;he had heard on the &s;tairca&s;e&mdash;a remem|brance, however, which made her in&s;i&s;t that Annette &s;hould pa&s;s the night with her, and, with much difficulty, &s;he, at length, prevailed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by that part of the girl's fear, which concerned the corridor.</P>
<P>Early on the following morning, as Emily cro&s;&s;ed the hall to the ramparts, &s;he heard a noi&s;y bu&s;tle in the court yard, and the clatter of hor&s;es' hoofs. Such unu&s;ual &s;ounds excited her curi|o&s;ity; and, in&s;tead of going to the ramparts, &s;he went to an up|per ca&s;ement, from whence &s;he &s;aw, in the court below, a large party of hor&s;emen, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ingular, but uniform, habit, and completely, though variou&s;ly armed. They wore a kind of &s;hort jacket, compo&s;ed of black and &s;carlet, and &s;everal of them had a cloak, of plain black, which, covering the per&s;on entirely, hung down to the &s;tirrups. As one of the&s;e cloaks glanced a&s;ide, &s;he &s;aw, beneath, daggers, apparently of different &s;izes, tucked in|to the hor&s;eman's belt. She further ob&s;erved, that the&s;e were carried, in the &s;ame manner, by many of the hor&s;emen without cloaks, mo&s;t of whom bore al&s;o pikes, or javelins. On their heads, were the &s;mall Italian caps, &s;ome of which were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by black feathers. Whether the&s;e caps gave a fierce air to the countenance, or that the countenances they &s;urmounted had naturally &s;uch an appearance, Emily thought &s;he had never, till then, &s;een an a&s;&s;emblage of faces &s;o &s;avage and terrific.&mdash;While &s;he gazed, &s;he almo&s;t fancied her&s;elf &s;urrounded by ban|ditti; and a vague thought glanced athwart her fancy&mdash;that Montoni was the captain of the group before her, and that this ca&s;tle was to be the place of rendezvous. The &s;trange and hor|rible &s;uppo&s;ition was but momentary, though her rea&s;on could &s;upply none more probable, and though &s;he di&s;covered, among
<PB N="85" REF="029378_0156_0FE0826F245358D0">
the band, the &s;trangers &s;he had formerly noticed with &s;o much alarm, who were now di&s;tingui&s;hed by the black plume.</P>
<P>While &s;he continued gazing, Cavigni, Verezzi, and Bertolini came forth from the hall, habited like the re&s;t, except that they wore hats, with a mixed plume of black and &s;carlet, and that their arms differed from tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the party. As they mounted their hor&s;es, Emily was &s;truck with the exulting joy, expre&s;&s;ed on the vi&s;age of Verezzi, while Cavigni was gay, yet with a &s;hade of thought on his countenance; and, as he manag|ed his hor&s;e with dexterity, his graceful and commanding figure, which exhibited the maje&s;ty of a hero, had never appeared to more advantage. Emily, as &s;he ob&s;erved him, thought he &s;ome|what re&s;embled Valancourt, in the &s;pirit and dignity of his per|&s;on; but &s;he looked in vain for the noble, benevolent counten|ance&mdash;the &s;oul's intelligence, which over&s;pread the features of the latter.</P>
<P>As &s;he was hoping, &s;he &s;carcely knew why, that Montoni would accompany the party, he appeared at the hall door, but unaccoutred. Having carefully ob&s;erved the hor&s;emen, con|ver&s;ed awhile with the cavaliers, and bidden them farewel, the band wheeled round the court, and, led by Verezzi, i&s;&s;ued forth under the portcullis; Montoni following to the portal, and gaz|ing after them for &s;ometime. Emily then retired from the ca&s;e|ment, and, now certain of being unmole&s;ted, went to walk on the ramparts, from whence &s;he &s;oon after &s;aw the party winding among the mountains to the we&s;t, appearing and di&s;appearing be|tween the woods, till di&s;tance confu&s;ed their figures, con&s;olidated their numbers, and only a dingy ma&s;s appeared moving along the heights.</P>
<P>Emily ob&s;erved, that no workmen were on the ramparts, and that the repairs of the fortifications &s;eemed to be completed. While &s;he &s;auntered thoughtfully on, &s;he heard di&s;tant foot&s;teps, and, rai&s;ing her eyes, &s;aw &s;everal men lurking under the ca&s;tle walls, who were evidently not workmen, but looked, as if they would have accorded well with the party, which was gone. Won|dering where Annette had hid her&s;elf &s;o long, who might have explained &s;ome of the late circum&s;tances, and then con&s;idering that Madame Montoni was probably ri&s;en, &s;he went to her dre&s;|&s;ing room, where &s;he mentioned what had occurred; but Ma|dame Montoni either would not, or could not, give any expla|nation of the event. The Signor's re&s;erve to his wife, on this &s;ubject, was probably nothing more than u&s;ual; yet, to Emily, it gave an air of my&s;tery to the whole affair, that &s;eemed to hint, there was danger, if not villainy, in his &s;chemes.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="029378_0157_0FE0697B8CA1C3C0">
Annette pre&s;ently came, and, as u&s;ual, was full of alarm; to her lady's eager inquiries of what &s;he had heard among the &s;er|vants, &s;he replied:</P>
<P>"Ah, Madam! nobody knows what it is all about, but old Carlo; he knows well enough, I dare &s;ay, but he is as clo&s;e as his ma&s;ter. Some &s;ay the Signor is going out to frighten the enemy, as they call it: but where is the enemy? Then others &s;ay, he is going to take away &s;ome body's ca&s;tle: but I am &s;ure he has room enough in his own, without taking other people's; and I am &s;ure I &s;hould like it a great deal better, if there were more people to fill it."</P>
<P>"Ah! you will &s;oon have your wi&s;h, I fear," replied Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>"No, madam, but &s;uch ill looking fellows are not worth hav|ing. I mean &s;uch gallant, &s;mart, merry fellows as Ludovico, who is always telling droll &s;tories, to make one laugh. It was but ye&s;terday he told me &s;uch a <HI>humour&s;ome</HI> tale! I can't help laughing at it now.&mdash;Says he&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, we can di&s;pen&s;e with the &s;tory," &s;aid her lady. "Ah!" continued Annette, "he &s;ees a great way, a great way further than other people! Now he &s;ees into all the Signor's meaning, without knowing a word about the matter!"</P>
<P>"How is that?" &s;aid Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>"Why he &s;ays&mdash;but he made me promi&s;e not to tell, and I would not di&s;oblige him for the world."</P>
<P>"What is it he made you promi&s;e not to tell? &s;aid her lady, &s;ternly. "I in&s;i&s;t upon knowing immediately&mdash;what is it he made you promi&s;e?"</P>
<P>"O Madam," cried Annette, "I would not tell for the uni|ver&s;e!" "I in&s;i&s;t upon your telling this in&s;tant," &s;aid Madame Montoni. "O dear madam! I would not tell for an hundred &s;equins! You would not have me for&s;wear my&s;elf, madam!" ex|claimed Annette.</P>
<P>"I will not wait another moment," &s;aid Madam Montoni Annette was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"The Signor &s;hall be informed of this directly," rejoined her mi&s;tre&s;s: "he will make you di&s;cover all."</P>
<P>"It is Ludovico, who has di&s;covered," &s;aid Annette: "but for mercy's &s;ake, madam, don't tell the Signor, and you &s;hall know all directly." Madam Montoni &s;aid, that &s;he would not.</P>
<P>"Well then, madam, Ludovico &s;ays, that the Signor, my ma&s;ter, is&mdash;is&mdash;that is, he only thinks &s;o, and any body, you know, madam, is free to think&mdash;that the Signor, my ma&s;ter, is&mdash;is&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="029378_0157_0FE0697B8CA1C3C0">
"Is what?" &s;aid her lady impatiently.</P>
<P>"That the Signor, my ma&s;ter, is going to be&mdash;a great rob|ber&mdash;that is&mdash;he is going to rob on his own account;&mdash;to be, (but I am &s;ure I don't under&s;tand what he means) to be a cap|tain of&mdash;robbers."</P>
<P>"Art thou in thy &s;en&s;es, Annette?" &s;aid Madame Montoni; or is this a trick to deceive me? Tell me, this in&s;tant, what Lu|dovico <HI>did</HI> &s;ay to thee;&mdash;no equivocation;&mdash;this in&s;tant."</P>
<P>"Nay, madam," cried Annette, "if this is all I am to get for having told the &s;ecret"&mdash;Her mi&s;tre&s;s thus continued to in|&s;i&s;t, and Annette to prote&s;t, till Montoni, him&s;elf, appeared, who bade the latter leave the room, and &s;he withdrew, trembling for the fate of her &s;tory. Emily al&s;o was retiring, but her aunt de|&s;ired &s;he would &s;tay; and Montoni had &s;o often made her a wit|ne&s;s of their contention, that he no longer had &s;cruples on that account.</P>
<P>"I in&s;i&s;t upon knowing this in&s;tant, Signor, what all this means:" &s;aid his wife&mdash;"what are all the&s;e armed men, whom they tell me of, gone out about?" Montoni an&s;wered her only with a look of &s;corn; and Emily wi&s;pered &s;omething to her. "It does not &s;ignify," &s;aid her aunt: "I will know; and I will know, too, what the ca&s;tle has been fortified for."</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid Montoni, "other bu&s;ine&s;s brought me here. I mu&s;t be trifled with no longer. I have immediate oc|ca&s;ion for what I demand&mdash;tho&s;e e&s;tates mu&s;t be given up, with|out further contention: or I may find a way&mdash;"</P>
<P>"They never &s;hall be given up," interrupted Madame Mon|toni: "they never &s;hall enable you to carry on your wild &s;chemes;&mdash;but what are the&s;e? I will know. Do you expect the ca&s;tle to be attacked? Do you expect enemies? Am I to be &s;hut up here, to be killed in a &s;iege?"</P>
<P>"Sign the writings," &s;aid Montoni, "and you &s;hall know more."</P>
<P>"What enemy can be coming?" continued his wife. "Have you entered into the &s;ervice of the &s;tate? Am I to be blocked up here to die?"</P>
<P>"That may po&s;&s;ibly happen," &s;aid Montoni, "unle&s;s you yield to my demand: for, come what may, you &s;hall not quit the ca&s;tle till then." Madame Montoni bur&s;t into loud la|mentation, which &s;he as &s;uddenly checked, con&s;idering that her hu&s;band's a&s;&s;ertions might be only artifices, employed to extort her con&s;ent. She hinted this &s;u&s;picion, and, in the next moment told him al&s;o, that his de&s;igns were not &s;o honourable as to &s;erve
<PB N="88" REF="029378_0158_0FE082816FC42A28">
the &s;tate, and that &s;he believed he had only commenced a cap|tain of banditti, to join the enemies of Venice, in plundering and laying wa&s;te the &s;urrounding country.</P>
<P>Montoni looked at her for a moment with a &s;teady and &s;tern countenance; while Emily trembled, and his wife, for once, thought &s;he had &s;aid too much. "You &s;hall be removed, this night," &s;aid he, "to the ea&s;t turret: there, perhaps, you may under&s;tand the danger of offending a man, who has an unlimited power over you."</P>
<P>Emily now fell at his feet, and, with tears of terror, &s;upplica|ted for her aunt, who &s;at, trembling with fear, and indignation; now ready to pour forth execrations, and now to join the inter|ce&s;&s;ions of Emily, Montoni, however, &s;oon interrupted the&s;e en|treaties with an horrible oath; and, as he bur&s;t from Emily, leaving his cloak in her hand, &s;he fell to the floor, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that occa&s;ioned her a &s;evere blow on the forehead. But he quit|ted the room, without attempting to rai&s;e her, who&s;e attention was called from her&s;elf by a deep groan from Madame Montoni, who continued otherwi&s;e unmoved in her chair, and had not fainted. Emily ha&s;tening to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;aw her eyes rolling and her features convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken to her, without receiving an an&s;wer, &s;he brought water, and &s;upported her head, while &s;he held it to her lips; but the increa&s;ing convul&s;ions &s;oon compelled Emily to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. On her way through the hall, in &s;earch of An|nette, &s;he met Montoni, whom &s;he told what had happened, and conjured to return and comfort her aunt; but he turned &s;ilently away, with a look of indifference, and went out upon the ram|parts. At length &s;he found old Carlo and Annette, and they ha&s;tened to the dre&s;&s;ing room, where Madame Montoni <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fallen on the floor, and was lying in &s;trong convul&s;ions. Having lifted her into the adjoining room, and laid her on the bed, the force of her di&s;order &s;till made all their &s;trength nece&s;&s;ary to hold her, while Annette trembled and &s;obbed, and old Carlo looked &s;ilently and piteou&s;ly on, as his feeble hands gra&s;ped tho&s;e of his mi&s;tre&s;s, till, turning his eyes upon Emily, he exclaimed, "Good God; Signora, what is the matter?"</P>
<P>Emily looked calmly at him, and &s;aw his inquiring eyes fix|ed on her: and Annette, locking up, &s;creamed loudly; for Emily's face was &s;tained with blood, which continued to fall &s;lowly from her forehead: but her attention had been &s;o entire|ly occupied by the &s;cene before her, that &s;he had felt no pain from the wound. She now held an handkerchief to her face, and,
<PB N="89" REF="029378_0158_0FE082816FC42A28">
notwith&s;tanding her faintne&s;s, continued to watch Madame Mon|toni, the violence of who&s;e convul&s;ions was abating, till at length they cea&s;ed, and left her in a kind of &s;tupor.</P>
<P>"My aunt mu&s;t remain quiet," &s;aid Emily. "Go, good Carlo; if we &s;hould want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I will &s;end for you. In the meantime, if you have an opportunity, &s;peak kindly of your mi&s;tre&s;s to your ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Carlo, "I have &s;een too much! I have little influence with the Signor. But do, dear young lady, take &s;ome care of your&s;elf; that is an ugly wound, and you look &s;adly."</P>
<P>"Thank you, my friend, for your con&s;ideration," &s;aid Emily, &s;miling kindly: "the wound is trifling, it came by a fall."</P>
<P>Carlo &s;hook his head, and left the room; and Emily, with Annette, continued to watch by her aunt. "Did my lady tell the Signor what Ludovico &s;aid, ma'am&s;elle?" a&s;ked Annette in a whi&s;per; but Emily quieted her fears on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"I thought what this quarrelling would come to," continued Annette: "I &s;uppo&s;e the Signor has been beating my lady."</P>
<P>"No, no, Annette, you are totally mi&s;taken, nothing extra|ordinary has happened."</P>
<P>"Why extraordinary things happen here &s;o often, ma'am&s;elle, that there is nothing in them. Here is another legion of tho&s;e ill looking fellows, come to the ca&s;tle, this morning."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! Annette, you will di&s;turb my aunt; we will talk of that by and bye."</P>
<P>They continued watching &s;ilently, till Madame Montoni ut|tered a low &s;igh, when Emily took her hand, and &s;poke &s;ooth|ingly to her; but the former gazed with uncon&s;cious eyes, and it was long before &s;he knew her niece. Her fir&s;t words then inquired for Montoni; to which Emily replied by an entreaty, that &s;he would compo&s;e her &s;pirits, and con&s;ent to be kept quiet, adding, that, if &s;he wi&s;hed any me&s;&s;age to be conveyed to him, &s;he would her&s;elf deliver it. "No," &s;aid her aunt faintly, "no&mdash;I have nothing new to tell him. Does he per&s;i&s;t in &s;ay|ing I &s;hall be removed from my chamber?"</P>
<P>Emily replied, that he had not &s;poken, on the &s;ubject, &s;ince Madame Montoni heard him; and then &s;he tried to divert her attention to &s;ome other topic; but her aunt &s;eemed to be inat|tentive to what &s;he &s;aid, and lo&s;t in &s;ecret thoughts. Emily hav|ing brought her &s;ome refre&s;hment, now le&s;t her to the care of Annette, and went in &s;earch of Montoni, whom &s;he found on a remote part of the rampart, conver&s;ing among a group of the men de&s;cribed by Annette. They &s;tood round him with fierce,
<PB N="90" REF="029378_0159_0FE0828C1EAC2088">
yet &s;ubjugated, looks, while he, &s;peaking earne&s;tly, and pointing to the walls, did not perceive Emily, who remained at &s;ome di&s;tance, waiting till he &s;hould be at lei&s;ure, and ob&s;erving in|voluntarily the appearance of one man, more &s;avage than his fel|lows, who &s;tood re&s;ting on his pike, and looking, over the &s;houl|ders of a comrade, at Montoni, to whom he li&s;tened with un|common earne&s;tne&s;s. This man was apparently of low condi|tion; yet his looks appeared not to acknowledge the &s;uperiority of Montoni, as did tho&s;e of his companions; and &s;ometimes they even a&s;&s;umed an air of authority, which the deci&s;ive man|ner of the Signor could not repre&s;s. Some few words of Mon|toni then pa&s;&s;ed in the wind; and, as the men were &s;eparating, &s;he heard him &s;ay, "This evening, then, begin the watch at &s;un&s;et."</P>
<P>"At &s;un&s;et, Signor," replied one or two of them, and walk|ed away; while Emily approached Montoni, who appeared de|&s;irous of avoiding her: but, though &s;he ob&s;erved this, &s;he had courage to proceed. She endeavoured to intercede once more for her aunt, repre&s;ented to him her &s;ufferings, and urged the danger of expo&s;ing her to a cold apartment in her pre&s;ent &s;tate. "She &s;uffers by her own folly," &s;aid Montoni, "and is not to be pitied;&mdash;&s;he knows how &s;he may avoid the&s;e &s;ufferings in future&mdash;if &s;he is removed to the turret, it will be her own fault. Let her be obedient, and &s;ign the writings you heard of, and I will think no more of it."</P>
<P>When Emily ventured &s;till to plead, he &s;ternly &s;ilenced and re|buked her for interfering in his dome&s;tic affairs, but, at length, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with this conce&s;&s;ion&mdash;That he would not remove Madame Montoni, on the en&s;uing night, but allow her till the next to con&s;ider, whether &s;he would re&s;ign her &s;ettlements or be impri&s;oned in the ea&s;t turret of the ca&s;tle, "where &s;he &s;hall find," he added, "a puni&s;hment &s;he may not expect."</P>
<P>Emily then ha&s;tened to inform her aunt of this &s;hort re&s;pite and of the alternative, that awaited her, to which the latter made no reply, but appeared thoughtful, while Emily, in con&s;ideration of her extreme languor, wi&s;hed to &s;ooth her mind by leading it to le&s;s intere&s;ting topics: and, though the&s;e efforts were un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, and Madame Montoni became peevi&s;h, her re&s;olution, on the contended point, &s;eemed &s;omewhat to relax, and Emily re|commended as her only means of &s;afety, that &s;he &s;hould &s;ubmit to Montoni's demand. "You know not what you advi&s;e," &s;aid her aunt. "Do you under&s;tand, that the&s;e e&s;tates will de|&s;cend to you at my death, if I per&s;i&s;t in a refu&s;al?"</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="029378_0159_0FE0828C1EAC2088">
"I was ignorant of that circum&s;tance, madam," replied Emily, "but the knowledge of it cannot withhold me from advi&s;ing you to adopt the conduct, which not only your peace, but, I fear, your &s;afety requires, and I entreat, that you will not &s;uffer a con&s;ideration comparatively &s;o trifling, to make you he&s;itate a moment in re&s;igning them."</P>
<P>"Are you &s;incere, niece?" "Is it po&s;&s;ible you can doubt it, madam?" Her aunt appeared to be affected. "You are not unworthy of the&s;e e&s;tates, niece," &s;aid &s;he: "I would wi&s;h to keep them for your &s;ake&mdash;you &s;hew a virtue I did not expect."</P>
<P>"How have I de&s;erved this reproof, madam?" &s;aid Emily &s;orrowfully.</P>
<P>"Reproof!" replied Madame Montoni: "I meant to prai&s;e your virtue."</P>
<P>"Alas! here is no exertion of virtue," rejoined Emily, "for here is no temptation to be overcome."</P>
<P>"Yet Mon&s;ieur Valancourt"&mdash;&s;aid her aunt. "O madam!" interrupted Emily, anticipating what &s;he would have &s;aid, "do not let me glance on that &s;ubject: do not let my mind be &s;tain|ed with a wi&s;h &s;o &s;hockingly &s;elf intere&s;ted." She immediately changed the topic, and continued with Madame Montoni, till &s;he withdrew to her apartment for the night.</P>
<P>At that hour the ca&s;tle was perfectly &s;till, and every inhabi|tant of it, except her&s;elf, &s;eemed to have retired to re&s;t. As &s;he pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed along the wide and lonely galleries, du&s;ky and &s;ilent, &s;he felt forlorn and apprehen&s;ive of&mdash;&s;he &s;carcely knew what; but when, entering the corridor, &s;he recollected the incident of the preceding night, a dread &s;eized her, le&s;t a &s;ubject of alarm, &s;imi|lar to that, which had befallen Annette, &s;hould occur to her, and which, whether real, or ideal, would, &s;he felt, have an almo&s;t equal effect upon her weakened &s;pirits. The chamber to which An|nette had alluded, &s;he did not exactly know, but under&s;tood it to be one of tho&s;e &s;he mu&s;t pa&s;s in the way to her own; and, &s;ending a fearful look forward into the gloom, &s;he &s;tepped light|ly and cautiou&s;ly along, till coming to a door, from whence i&s;|&s;ued a low &s;ound, &s;he he&s;itated and pau&s;ed; and during the delay of that moment, her fears &s;o much increa&s;ed, that &s;he had no power to move from the &s;pot. Believing, that &s;he heard a human-voice within, &s;he was &s;omewhat revived; but in the next moment, the door was opened, and a per&s;on, whom &s;he con|ceived to be Montoni, appeared, who in&s;tantly &s;tarted back, and clo&s;ed it, though not before &s;he had &s;een, by the light that burned in the chamber another per&s;on, &s;itting in a melancholy

Her terror vani&s;hed, but her a&s;toni&s;hment only began, which was now rou&s;ed by the my&s;terious &s;ecrecy of Montoni's manner, and by the di&s;covery of a per&s;on, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e thus vi&s;ited at midnight, in an apartment which had long been &s;hut up, and of which &s;uch extraordinary reports were circulated.</P>
<P>While &s;he thus continued he&s;itating, &s;trongly prompted to watch Montoni's motions, yet fearing to irritate him by appearing to notice them, the door was again opened cautiou&s;ly, and as in|&s;tantly clo&s;ed as before. She then &s;tepped &s;oftly to her chamber, which was the next but one to this, but, having put down her lamp, returned to an ob&s;cure corner of the corridor, to ob&s;erve the proceedings of this half &s;een per&s;on, and to a&s;certain, whe|ther it was indeed Montoni.</P>
<P>Having waited in &s;ilent expectation for a few minutes, with her eyes fixed on the door, it was again opened, and the &s;ame per&s;on appeared, whom &s;he now knew to be Montoni.

<P>ON the following morning, Emily went early to the apart|ment of Madame Montoni, who had &s;lept well, and was much recovered. Her &s;pirits al&s;o had returned with her health, and her re&s;olution to oppo&s;e Montoni's demands revived, though it yet &s;truggled with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which Emily, who trembled for the con&s;equence of further oppo&s;ition, endeavoured to confirm.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="029378_0160_0FE08290F238A0E0">
Her aunt, as has been already &s;hewn, had a di&s;po&s;ition, which delighted in contradiction, and which taught her, when unplea|&s;ant circum&s;tances were offered to her under&s;tanding, not to in|quire into their truth, but to &s;eek for arguments, by which &s;he might make them appear fal&s;e. Long habit had &s;o entirely con|firmed this natural propen&s;ity, that &s;he was not con&s;cious of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing it. Emily's remon&s;trances and repre&s;entations, therefore rou&s;ed her pride, in&s;tead of alarming, or convincing her judgment, and &s;he &s;till relied upon the di&s;covery of &s;ome means, by which &s;he might yet avoid &s;ubmitting to the demand of her hu&s;band. Con&s;idering, that, if &s;he could once e&s;cape from his ca&s;tle, &s;he might defy his power, and, obtaining a deci&s;ive &s;eparation, live in comfort on the e&s;tates, that yet remained for her, &s;he men|tioned this to her niece, who accorded with her in the wi&s;h, but differed from her as to the probability of its completion. She repre&s;ented the impo&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing the gates, &s;ecured and guarded as they were, and the extreme danger of committing her de&s;ign to the di&s;cretion of a &s;ervant, who might either pur|po&s;ely betray, or accidentally di&s;clo&s;e it.&mdash;Montoni's vengeance would al&s;o di&s;dain re&s;traint, if her intention was detected: and, though Emily wi&s;hed, as fervently as &s;he could do, to regain her freedom, and return to France, &s;he con&s;ulted only Madame Mon|toni's &s;afety and per&s;evered in advi&s;ing her to relinqui&s;h her &s;et|tlement, without braving further outrage.</P>
<P>The &s;truggle of contrary emotions, however, continued to rage in her aunt's bo&s;om, and &s;he &s;till brooded over the chance of ef|fecting an e&s;cape. While &s;he thus &s;at, Montoni entered the room, and, without noticing his wife's indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;aid, that he came to remind her of the impolicy of trifling with him, and that he gave her only till the evening to determine, whether &s;he would con&s;ent to his demand, or compel him, by a refu&s;al, to re|move her to the ea&s;t turret. He added, that a party of cavaliers would dine with him, that day, and that he expected &s;he would &s;it at the head of the table, where Emily, al&s;o, mu&s;t be pre&s;ent. Madame Montoni was now on the point of uttering an ab&s;olute refu&s;al, but, &s;uddenly con&s;idering, that her liberty, during this entertainment, though circum&s;cribed, might favour her further plans, &s;he acquie&s;ced with &s;eeming reluctance, and Montoni, &s;oon after left the apartment. His command &s;truck Emily with &s;ur|pri&s;e and apprehen&s;ion, who &s;hrunk from the thought of being ex|po&s;ed to the gaze of &s;trangers, &s;uch as her fancy repre&s;ented the&s;e to be, and the words of Count Morano, now again recollected, did not &s;ooth her fears. When &s;he withdrew to prepare for din|ner,
<PB N="94" REF="029378_0161_0FE0829DD88586E0">
&s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with even more &s;implicity than u&s;ual, that &s;he might e&s;cape ob&s;ervation&mdash;a policy, which did not avail her, for, as &s;he repa&s;&s;ed to her aunt's apartment, &s;he was met by Mon|toni, who cen&s;ured what he called her prudi&s;h appearance, and in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;he would wear the mo&s;t &s;plendid dre&s;s &s;he had, even that, which had been prepared for her intended nuptials with Count Morano, and which, it now appeared, her aunt had care|fully brought with her from Venice. This was made, not in the Venetian, but, in the Neapolitan fa&s;hion, &s;o as to &s;et off the &s;hape and figure, to the utmo&s;t advantage. In it, her beautiful che&s;nut tre&s;&s;es were negligently bound up in pearls, and &s;uffered to fall back again on her neck. The &s;implicity of a better ta&s;te, than Madame Montoni's, was con&s;picuous in this dre&s;s, &s;plendid as it was, and Emily's unaffected beauty never had appeared more captivatingly. She had now only to hope, that Montoni's order was prompted, not by any extraordinary de&s;ign, but by an o&s;ten|tation of di&s;playing his family, richly attired, to the eyes of &s;tran|gers; yet nothing le&s;s than his ab&s;olute command could have prevailed with her to wear a dre&s;s, that had been de&s;igned for &s;uch an offen&s;ive purpo&s;e, much le&s;s to have worn it on this oc|ca&s;ion. As &s;he de&s;cended to dinner, the emotion of her mind threw a faint blu&s;h over her countenance, and heightened its in|tere&s;ting expre&s;&s;ion; for timidity had made her linger in her apartment, till the utmo&s;t moment, and, when &s;he entered the hall, in which a kind of &s;tate dinner was &s;pread, Montoni and his gue&s;ts were already &s;eated at the table. She was then going to place her&s;elf by her aunt; but Montoni waved his hand, and two of the cavaliers ro&s;e, and &s;eated her between them.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e was a tall man, with &s;trong Italian features, an aquiline no&s;e, and dark penetrating eyes, that fla&s;hed with fire, when his mind was agitated, and even in its &s;tate of re&s;t, retained &s;omewhat of the wildne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ions. His vi&s;age was long and narrow, and his complexion of a &s;ickly yellow.</P>
<P>The other, who appeared to be about forty, had features of a different ca&s;t, yet Italian, and his look was &s;low, &s;ubtle and pen|etrating; his eyes, of a dark gray, were &s;mall, and hollow; his complexion was a &s;unburnt brown, and the cantour of his face, though inclined to oval, was irregular and ill-formed.</P>
<P>Eight other gue&s;ts &s;at round the table, who were all dre&s;&s;ed in an uniform, and had all an expre&s;&s;ion, more or le&s;s, of wild fiercene&s;s, of &s;ubtle de&s;ign, or of licentious pa&s;&s;ions. As Emily timidly &s;urveyed them, &s;he remembered the &s;cene of the preced|ing morning, and again almo&s;t fancied her&s;elf &s;urrounded by
<PB N="95" REF="029378_0161_0FE0829DD88586E0">
banditti; then, looking back to the tranquillity of her early life, &s;he felt &s;carcely le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment, than grief, at her pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion. The &s;cene, in which they &s;at, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the allu&s;ion; it was an ancient hall, gloomy from the &s;tyle of its architecture, from its great extent, and becau&s;e almo&s;t the only light it received was from one large gothic window, and from a pair of folding doors, which, being open, admitted likewi&s;e a view of the we&s;t rampart, with the wild mountains of the Apennine beyond.</P>
<P>The middle compartment of this hall ro&s;e into a vaulted roof, enriched with fret work, and &s;upported, on three &s;ides, by pil|lars of marble; beyond the&s;e, long colonades retired in gloomy grandeur, till their extent was lo&s;t in twilight. The lighte&s;t foot&s;teps of the &s;ervants, as they advanced through the&s;e, were returning in whi&s;pering echoes, and their figures &s;een at a di&s;tance imperfectly through the du&s;k, frequently awakened Emily's im|agination. She looked alternately at Montoni, at his gue&s;ts and on the &s;urrounding &s;cene; and then, remembering her dear na|tive province, her plea&s;ant home and the &s;implicity and goodne&s;s of the friends, whom &s;he had lo&s;t, grief and &s;urpri&s;e again oc|cupied her mind.</P>
<P>When her thoughts could return from the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;he fancied &s;he ob&s;erved an air of authority towards his gue&s;ts, &s;uch as &s;he never had before &s;een him a&s;&s;ume, though he had al|ways been di&s;tingui&s;hed by an haughty carriage; there was &s;omething al&s;o in the manners of the &s;trangers, that &s;eemed per|fectly, though not &s;ervilely, to acknowledge his &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>During dinner, the conver&s;ation was chiefly on war and poli|tics. They talked with energy of the &s;tate of Venice, its dan|gers, the character of the reigning Doge and of the chief &s;enators; and then &s;poke of the &s;tate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rome. When the repa&s;t was over, they ro&s;e, and, each filling his goblet with wine from the gilded ewer, that &s;tood be&s;ide him, drank "Succe&s;s to our ex|ploits!" Montoni was lifting his goblet to his lips to drink this toa&s;t, when &s;uddenly the wine hi&s;&s;ed, ro&s;e to the brim, and, as he held the gla&s;s from him, it bur&s;t into a thou&s;and pieces.</P>
<P>To him, who con&s;tantly u&s;ed that &s;ort of Venice gla&s;s, which had the quality of breaking, upon receiving poi&s;oned liquor, a &s;u&s;picion, that &s;ome of his gue&s;ts had endeavoured to betray him, in&s;tantly occurred, and he ordered all the gates to be clo&s;ed, drew his &s;word, and, looking round on them, who &s;tood in &s;ilent amazement, exclaimed, "Here is a traitor among us; let tho&s;e that are innocent, a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;covering the guilty."</P>
<P>Indignation fla&s;hed from the eyes of the cavaliers, who all drew their &s;words; and Madame Montoni, terrified at what
<PB N="96" REF="029378_0162_0FE082A27B78C310">
might en&s;ue, was ha&s;tening from the hall, when her hu&s;band commanded her to &s;tay; but his further words could not now be di&s;tingui&s;hed, for the voice of every per&s;on ro&s;e together. His order, that all the &s;ervants &s;hould appear, was at length obeyed, and they declared their ignorance of any deceit&mdash;a prote&s;tation which could not be believed; for it was evident, that, as Mon|toni's liquor, and his only, had been poi&s;oned, a deliberate de|&s;ign had been formed again&s;t his life, which could not have been carried &s;o far towards its accompli&s;hment, without the connivance of the &s;ervant, who had the care of the wine ewers.</P>
<P>This man, with another, who&s;e face betrayed either the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, or the fear of puni&s;hment, Montoni ordered to be chained in&s;tantly, and confined in a &s;trong room, which had formerly been u&s;ed as a pri&s;on. Thither, likewi&s;e, he would have &s;ent all his gue&s;ts, had he not fore&s;een the con&s;equence of &s;o bold and unju&s;tifiable a proceeding. As to tho&s;e, therefore, he contented him&s;elf with &s;wearing, that no man &s;hould pa&s;s the gates, till this extraordinary affair had been inve&s;tigated, and then &s;ternly bade his wife retire to her apartment, whither he &s;uffered Emily to attend her.</P>
<P>In about half an hour, he followed to the dre&s;&s;ing room; and Emily ob&s;erved, with horror, his dark countenance and quiver|ing lip, and heard him denounce vengeance on her aunt.</P>
<P>"It will avail you nothing," &s;aid he to his wife, for a moment to deny the fact; I have proof of your guilt. Your only chance of mercy re&s;ts on a full confe&s;&s;ion;&mdash;there is nothing to hope from &s;ullenne&s;s or fal&s;ehood; your accomplice has confe&s;&s;ed all."</P>
<P>Emily's fainting &s;pirits were rou&s;ed by a&s;toni&s;hment, as &s;he heard her aunt accu&s;ed of a crime &s;o atrocious, and &s;he could not admit the po&s;&s;ibility of her guilt. Meanwhile Madame Mon|toni's agitation did not permit her to reply; alternately her complexion varied from livid palene&s;s to a crim&s;on flu&s;h; and &s;he trembled,&mdash;but, whether with fear, or with indignation, it were difficult to decide.</P>
<P>"Spare your words," &s;aid Montoni, &s;eeing her about to &s;peak," your countenance makes full confe&s;&s;ion of your crime.&mdash;You &s;hall be in&s;tantly removed to the ea&s;t turret."</P>
<P>"This accu&s;ation," &s;aid Madame Montoni, &s;peaking with dif|ficulty, "is u&s;ed only as an excu&s;e for your cruelty; I di&s;dain to reply to it. You do not believe me guilty."</P>
<P>"Signor!" &s;aid Emily &s;olemnly, "this dreadful charge I would an&s;wer with my life, is fal&s;e. Nay, Signor," &s;he added, ob&s;erving the &s;everity of his countenance, "this is no moment
<PB N="97" REF="029378_0162_0FE082A27B78C310">
for re&s;traint on my part; I do not &s;cruple to tell you, that you are deceived&mdash;mo&s;t wickedly deceived, by the &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;ome per&s;on, who aims at the ruin of my aunt: it is impo&s;&s;ible, that you could your&s;elf have imagined a crime &s;o hideous."</P>
<P>Montoni, his lips trembling more than before, replied only, "If you value your own &s;afety," addre&s;&s;ing Emily, "you will be &s;ilent. I &s;hall know how to interpret your remon&s;trances, &s;hould you per&s;evere in them."</P>
<P>Emily rai&s;ed her eyes calmy to heaven. "Here is, indeed, then, nothing to hope!" &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"Peace!" cried Montoni, "or you &s;hall find there is &s;ome|thing to fear."</P>
<P>He turned to his wife, who had now recovered her &s;pirits, and who vehemently and wildly remon&s;trated upon this my&s;teri|ous &s;u&s;picion: but Montoni's rage heightened with her indigna|tion, and Emily, dreading the event of it, threw her&s;elf between them, and cla&s;ped his knees in &s;ilence, looking up in his face with an expre&s;&s;ion that might have &s;oftened the heart of a fiend.&mdash;Whether his was hardened by a conviction of Madame Montoni's guilt, or that a bare &s;u&s;picion of it made him eager to exerci&s;e vengeance, he was totally and alike in&s;en&s;ible to the di&s;tre&s;s of his wife, and to the pleading looks of Emily, whom he made no attempt to rai&s;e, but was vehemently menacing both, when he was called out of the room by &s;ome per&s;on at the door. As he &s;hut the door, Emily heard him turn the lock and take out the key; &s;o that Madame Montoni and her&s;elf were now pri&s;oners; and &s;he &s;aw that his de&s;igns became more and more terrible.&mdash;Her endeavours to explain his motives for this circum&s;tance were almo&s;t as ineffectual as tho&s;e to &s;ooth the di&s;tre&s;s of her aunt, who&s;e innocence &s;he could not doubt; but &s;he, at length, ac|counted for Montoni's readine&s;s to &s;u&s;pect his wife by his own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of cruelty towards her, and for the &s;udden violence of his pre&s;ent conduct again&s;t both, before even his &s;u&s;picions could be completely formed, by his general eagerne&s;s to effect &s;uddenly whatever he was led to de&s;ire and his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of ju&s;tice, or humanity, in accompli&s;hing it.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni, after &s;ometime, again looked round, in &s;earch of a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape from the ca&s;tle, and conver&s;ed with Emily on the &s;ubject, who was now willing to encounter any hazard, though &s;he forbore to encourage a hope in her aunt, which &s;he her&s;elf did not admit. How &s;trongly the edifice was &s;ecured, and how vigilantly guarded, &s;he knew too well; and trembled to commit their &s;afety to the caprice of the &s;ervant,
<PB N="98" REF="029378_0163_0FE082AFB8364628">
who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they mu&s;t &s;olicit. Old Carlo was compa&s;&s;ionate, but he &s;eemed to be too much in his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t to be tru&s;t|ed by them; Annette could of her&s;elf do little, and Emily knew Ludovico only from her report. At pre&s;ent, however, the&s;e con|&s;iderations were u&s;ele&s;s, Madame Montoni and her niece being &s;hut up from all intercour&s;e, even with the per&s;ons, whom there might be the&s;e rea&s;ons to reject.</P>
<P>In the hall, confu&s;ion and tumult &s;till reigned. Emily, as &s;he li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly to the murmur, that &s;ounded along the gallery, &s;ometimes fancied &s;he heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words, and, when &s;he con&s;idered the nature of the provocation, given by Montoni, and his impetuo&s;ity, it appeared probable, that nothing le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> arms would terminate the contention. Madame Montoni having exhau&s;ted all her expre&s;&s;ions of indignation, and Emily hers of comfort, they remained &s;ilent, in that kind of breathle&s;s &s;tillne&s;s, which, in nature, often &s;ucceeds to the uproar of conflicting ele|ments; a &s;tillne&s;s, like the morning, that dawns upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of an earthquake.</P>
<P>An uncertain kind of terror pervaded Emily's mind; the cir|cum&s;tances of the pa&s;t hour &s;till came dimly and confu&s;edly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her memory; and her thoughts were various and rapid, though without tumult.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate of waking vi&s;ions &s;he was recalled by a knock|ing at the chamber door, and inquring who was there, heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whi&s;pering voice of Annette.</P>
<P>"Dear madam, let me come in, I have a great deal to &s;ay" &s;aid the poor girl.</P>
<P>"The door is locked," an&s;wered her lady.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am, but do pray open it."</P>
<P>"The Signor has the key, &s;aid Madame Montoni."</P>
<P>"O ble&s;&s;ed Virgin! what will become of us?" exclaimed Annette.</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;i&s;t us to e&s;cape," &s;aid her mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Where is Ludovico?"</P>
<P>"Below in the hall, ma'am, among&s;t them all, fighting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the be&s;t of them!"</P>
<P>"Fighting! who are fighting!" cried Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>"Why the Signor, ma'am, and all the Signors, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> many more.</P>
<P>"Is any per&s;on much hurt?" &s;aid Emily in a tremulous voice. "Hurt! Yes, ma'am&s;elle,&mdash;there they lie bleeding, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;words are cla&s;hing, and&mdash;O holy &s;aints!

<P><PB N="99" REF="029378_0163_0FE082AFB8364628">
"Fly!" cried Emily, "fly! we cannot open the door."</P>
<P>Annette repeated, that they were coming, and in the &s;ame mo|ment fled.</P>
<P>"Be calm, madam," &s;aid Emily, turning to her aunt. "I en|treat you be calm, I am not frightened&mdash;not frightened in the lea&s;t, do not you be alarmed."</P>
<P>"You can &s;carcely &s;upport your&s;elf," replied her aunt; "Merciful God! what is it they mean to do with us?"</P>
<P>"They come perhaps to liberate us," &s;aid Emily, "Signor Montoni perhaps is&mdash;is conquered."</P>
<P>The belief of his death gave her &s;pirits a &s;udden &s;hock, and &s;he grew faint as &s;he &s;aw him in imagination, expiring at her feet.</P>
<P>"They are coming!" cried Madame Montoni&mdash;" I hear their &s;teps&mdash;they are at the door!"</P>
<P>Emily turned her languid eyes to the door, but terror depriv|ed her of utterance. The key &s;ounded in the lock; the door opened, and Montoni appeared, followed by three ruffian-like men. "Execute your orders," &s;aid he, turning to them, and pointing to his wife, who &s;hrieked, but was immediately carried from the room; while Emily, &s;unk, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, on a couch, by which &s;he had endeavoured to &s;upport her&s;elf. When &s;he re|covered, &s;he was alone, and recollected only, that Madame Mon|toni had been there, together with &s;ome unconnected particulars of the preceding tran&s;action, which were, however, &s;ufficient to renew all her terror. She looked wildly round the apartment, as if in &s;earch of &s;ome means of intelligence, concerning her aunt, while neither her own danger, or an idea of e&s;caping from the room, immediately occurred.</P>
<P>When her recollection was more complete, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf and went, but with only a faint hope, to examine whether the door was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">fa&s;tened. It was &s;o, and &s;he then &s;tepped timidly out into the gallery, but pau&s;ed there, uncertain which way &s;he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Her fir&s;t wi&s;h was to gather &s;ome information, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, and &s;he, at length, turned her &s;teps to go to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, where Annette and the other &s;ervants u&s;ually waited.</P>
<P>Every where, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he heard, from a di&s;tance, the uproar of contention, and the figures and faces, which &s;he met, hurrying along the pa&s;&s;ages, &s;truck her mind with di&s;may. Em|ily might now have appeared, like an angel of light, encompa&s;&s;ed by fiends. At length, &s;he reached the le&s;&s;er hall, which was &s;ilent and de&s;erted, but, panting for breath, &s;he &s;at down to re|cover her&s;elf. The total &s;tillne&s;s of this place was as awful as the tumult, from which &s;he had e&s;caped: but &s;he had now time

to recall her &s;cattered thoughts, to remember her per&s;onal dan|ger, and to con&s;ider of &s;ome means of &s;afety. She perceived, that it was u&s;ele&s;s to &s;eek Madame Montoni, through the wide extent and intricacies of the ca&s;tle, now, too, when every avenue &s;eemed to be be&s;et by ruffians; in this hall &s;he could not re|&s;olve to &s;tay, for &s;he knew not how &s;oon it might become their place of rendezvous; and, though &s;he wi&s;hed to go to her cham|ber, &s;he dreaded again to encounter them on the way.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he &s;at trembling and he&s;itating, when a di&s;tant mur|mur broke on the &s;ilence, and grew louder and louder, till &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed voices and &s;teps approaching. She then ro&s;e to go, but the &s;ounds came along the only pa&s;&s;age, by which &s;he could depart, and &s;he was compelled to await in the hall, the arrival of the per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;teps &s;he heard. As the&s;e advanced, &s;he di&s;|tingui&s;hed groans, and then &s;aw a man borne &s;lowly along by four others. Her &s;pirits faltered at the &s;ight, and &s;he leaned again&s;t the wall for &s;upport. The bearers, meanwhile, entered the hall, and, being too bu&s;ily occupied to detain, or even notice Emily, &s;he attempted to leave it, but her &s;trength failed, and &s;he again &s;at down on the bench. A damp chillne&s;s came over her; her &s;ight became confu&s;ed; &s;he knew not what had pa&s;&s;ed, or where &s;he was, yet the groans of the wounded per&s;on &s;till vibrat|ed on her heart. In a few moments, the tide of life &s;eemed again to flow; &s;he began to breathe more freely, and her &s;en&s;es revived. She had not fainted, nor had ever totally lo&s;t her con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, but had contrived to &s;upport her&s;elf on the bench; &s;till without courage to turn her eyes upon the unfortunate ob|ject, which remained near her, and about whom the men were yet too much engaged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to her.</P>
<P>When her &s;trength returned, &s;he ro&s;e, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to leave the hall, though her anxiety, having produced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vain inqui|ries concerning Madame Montoni, had thus made a di&s;covery of her&s;elf. Towards her chamber &s;he now ha&s;tened, as fa&s;t as her &s;teps would bear her, for &s;he &s;till perceived, upon her pa&s;&s;age, the &s;ounds of confu&s;ion at a di&s;tance, and &s;he endeavoured, by taking her way through &s;ome ob&s;cure rooms, to avoid encount|ering the per&s;ons, who&s;e looks had terrified her before, as well as tho&s;e parts of the ca&s;tle, where the tumult &s;till raged.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he reached her chamber, and, having &s;ecured the door of the corridor, felt her&s;elf, for a moment, in &s;afety. A profound &s;tillne&s;s reigned in this remote apartment, which not even the faint murmur of the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;ounds now reached. She &s;at down, near one of the ca&s;ements, and, as &s;he gazed on
<PB N="101" REF="029378_0164_0FE083BFE4ECE180">
the mountain view beyond, the deep repo&s;e of its beauty &s;truck her with all the force of contra&s;t, and &s;he could &s;carcely believe her&s;elf &s;o near a &s;cene of &s;avage di&s;cord. The contending ele|ments &s;eemed to have retired from their natural &s;pheres, and to have collected them&s;elves into the minds of men, for there alone the tempe&s;t now reigned.</P>
<P>Emily tried to tranquillize her &s;pirits, but anxiety made her con&s;tantly li&s;ten for &s;ome &s;ound, and often look out upon the ramparts, where all, however, was lonely and &s;till. As a &s;en&s;e of her own immediate danger had decrea&s;ed, her apprehen&s;ion concerning Madame Montoni heightened, who, &s;he remembered, had been fiercely threatened with confinement in the ea&s;t turret, and it was po&s;&s;ible, that her hu&s;band had &s;atisfied his pre&s;ent vengeance with this puni&s;hment. She, therefore, determined, when night &s;hould return, and the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle &s;hould be a&s;leep, to explore the way to the turret, which, as the direc|tion it &s;tood in was mentioned, appeared not very difficult to be done. She knew, indeed, that although her aunt might be there, &s;he could afford her no effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but it might give her &s;ome comfort even to know, that &s;he was di&s;covered, and to hear the &s;ound of her niece's voice; for her&s;elf, any certainty, con|cerning Madame Montoni's fate, appeared mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> tolerable than this exhau&s;ting &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Annette did not appear, and Emily was &s;urpri&s;|ed, and &s;omewhat alarmed for her, whom, in the confu&s;ion of the late &s;cene, various accidents might have befallen, and it was improbable, that &s;he would have failed to come to her apartment, unle&s;s &s;omething unfortunate had happened.</P>
<P>Thus the hours pa&s;&s;ed in &s;olitude, in &s;ilence, and in anxious conjecturing. Being not once di&s;turbed by a me&s;&s;age, or a &s;ound, it appeared, that Montoni had wholly forgotten her, and it gave her &s;ome comfort to find, that &s;he could be &s;o unnoticed. She endeavoured to withdraw her thoughts from the anxiety, that preyed upon them, but they refu&s;ed control; &s;he could neither read, or draw, and the tones of her lute were &s;o utterly di&s;cord|ant with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her feelings, that &s;he could not endure them for a moment.</P>
<P>The &s;un, at length, &s;et behind the we&s;tern mountains; his fiery beams <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aded from the clouds, and then a dun melancholy purple drew over them, and gradually involved the features of the country below. Soon after, the &s;entinels pa&s;&s;ed on the ram|part to commence the watch.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="029378_0165_0FE082C35CC203C8">
Twilight had now &s;pread its gloom over every object; the di&s;mal ob&s;curity of her chamber recalled fearful thoughts, but &s;he remembered, that to procure a light &s;he mu&s;t pa&s;s through a great extent of the ca&s;tle, and, above all, through the halls, where &s;he had already experienced &s;o much horror. Darkne&s;s, indeed, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits, made &s;ilence and &s;olitude ter|rible to her; it would al&s;o prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of her finding her way to the turret, and condemn her to remain in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, concerning the fate of her aunt; yet &s;he dared not to venture forth for a lamp.</P>
<P>Continuing at the ca&s;ement, that &s;he might catch the la&s;t lin|gering gleam of evening, a thou&s;and vague images of fear floated on her fancy. "What if &s;ome of the&s;e ruffians," &s;aid &s;he," &s;hould find out the private &s;tairca&s;e, and in the darkne&s;s of night &s;teal into my chamber!" Then, recollecting the my&s;terious inhabitant of the neighbouring apartment, her terror changed its object. "He is not a pri&s;oner," &s;aid &s;he, "though he remains in one cham|ber, for Montoni did not fa&s;ten the door when he left i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; the unknown per&s;on him&s;elf did this; it is certain, therefore, he can come out when he plea&s;es."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, for, notwith&s;tanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he terrors of darkne&s;s, &s;he con&s;idered it to be very improbable, whoever he was, that he could have any intere&s;t in intruding upon her retirement; and again the &s;ubject of her emotion changed, when, remembering her nearne&s;s to the chamber, where the veil had formerly di&s;|clo&s;ed a dreadful &s;pectacle, &s;he doubted whether &s;ome pa&s;&s;age might not communicate between it and the in&s;ecure door of the &s;tairca&s;e.</P>
<P>It was now entirely dark, and &s;he left the ca&s;ement. As &s;he &s;at with her eyes fixed on the hearth, &s;he thought &s;he perceived there a &s;park of light: it twinkled and di&s;appeared, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n again was vi&s;ible. At length, with much care, &s;he fanned the embers of a wood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, that had been lighted in the morning, into flame, and having communicated it to a lamp, which always &s;tood in her room, felt a &s;atisfaction not to be conceived, with|out a review of her &s;ituation. Her fir&s;t care was to guard the door of the &s;tairca&s;e, for which purpo&s;e &s;he placed again&s;t it all the furniture &s;he could move, and &s;he was thus employed, for &s;ometime, at the end of which &s;he had another in&s;tance how much more oppre&s;&s;ive misfortune is to the idle, than to the bu&s;y; for, having then lei&s;ure to think over all the circum&s;tances of her pre&s;ent afflictions, &s;he imagined a thou&s;and evils for futurity, and the&s;e real and ideal &s;ubjects of di&s;tre&s;s alike wounded her mind,
<PB N="103" REF="029378_0165_0FE082C35CC203C8">
Thus heavily moved the hours till midnight, when &s;he counted the &s;ullen notes of the great clock, as they rolled along the ram|part, unmingled with any &s;ound, except the di&s;tant footfall of a &s;entinel, who came to relieve guard. She now thought &s;he might venture towards the turret, and, having gently opened the chamber door to examine the corridor, and to li&s;ten if any per|&s;on was &s;tirring in the ca&s;tle, found all around in perfect &s;tillne&s;s. Yet no &s;ooner had &s;he left the room, than &s;he perceived a light fla&s;h on the walls of the corridor, and, without waiting to &s;ee by whom it was carried, &s;he &s;hrunk back, and clo&s;ed her door. No one approaching, &s;he conjectured, that it was Montoni going to pay his midnight vi&s;it to her unknown neighbour, and &s;he de|termined to wait, till he &s;hould have retired to his own apart|ment.</P>
<P>When the chimes had tolled another half hour, &s;he once more opened the door, and, perceiving that no per&s;on was in the cor|ridor, ha&s;tily cro&s;&s;ed into a pa&s;&s;age, that led along the &s;outh &s;ide of the ca&s;tle towards the &s;tairca&s;e, whence &s;he believed &s;he could ea&s;ily find her way to the turret. Often pau&s;ing on her way, li&s;tening apprehen&s;ively to the murmurs of the wind, and looking fearfully onward into the gloom of the long pa&s;&s;ages, &s;he at length reached the &s;tairca&s;e; but there her perplexity began. Two pa&s;&s;ages appeared, of which &s;he knew not how to prefer one, and was compelled, at la&s;t to decide by chance, rather than by cir|cum&s;tances. That &s;he entered, opened fir&s;t into a wide gallery, along which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed lightly and &s;wiftly; for the lonely a&s;pect of the place awed her, and &s;he &s;tarted at the echo of her own &s;teps.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden, &s;he thought &s;he heard a voice, and, not di&s;tin|gui&s;hing from whence it came, feared equally to proceed, or to return. For &s;ome moments, &s;he &s;tood in an attitude of li&s;tening ex|pectation, &s;hrinking almo&s;t from her&s;elf and &s;carcely daring to look round her. The voice came again, but, though it was now near her, terror did not allow her to judge exactly whence it proceeded. She though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, however, that it was the voice of complaint, and her belief was &s;oon confirmed by a low moaning &s;ound, that &s;eemed to proceed from one of the chambers, opening into the gallery. It in&s;tantly occurred to her, that Madame Montoni might be there confined, and &s;he advanced to the door to &s;peak, but was checked by con&s;idering, that &s;he was, perhaps, going to commit her&s;elf to a &s;tranger, who might di&s;cover her to Montoni; for, though this per&s;on, whoever it was, &s;eemed to be in affliction, it did not follow, that he was a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="029378_0166_0FE082C83874E950">
While the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, and left her &s;till in he&s;itation, the voice &s;poke again, and, calling "Ludovico," &s;he then perceived it to be that of Annette; on which, no lon|ger he&s;itating, &s;he went in joy to an&s;wer her.</P>
<P>"Ludovico!" cried Annette, &s;obbing&mdash;"Ludovico!"</P>
<P>"It is I," &s;aid Emily, trying to open the door. "How came you here? Who &s;hut you up?"</P>
<P>"Ludovico!" repeated Annette&mdash;"O Ludovico!"</P>
<P>"It is not Ludovico, it is I&mdash;Mademoi&s;elle Emily."</P>
<P>Annette cea&s;ed &s;obbing, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"If you can open the door, let me in," &s;aid Emily, "here is no per&s;on to hurt you."</P>
<P>"Ludovico!&mdash;O, Ludovico!" cried Annette.</P>
<P>Emily now lo&s;t her patience, and, her fear of being overheard increa&s;ing, &s;he was even nearly about to leave the door, when &s;he con&s;idered, that Annette might, po&s;&s;ibly, know &s;omething of the &s;ituation of Madame Montoni, or direct her to the turret.&mdash;At length, &s;he obtained a reply, though little &s;atisfactory to her que&s;tions, for Annette knew nothing of Madame Montoni, and only conjured Emily to tell her what was become of Ludovico. Of him &s;he had no information to give, and &s;he again a&s;ked who had &s;hut Annette up.</P>
<P>"Ludovico," &s;aid the poor girl, "Ludovico &s;hut me up.&mdash;When I ran away from the dre&s;&s;ing room door to day I went, I &s;carcely knew where, for &s;afety; and, in this gallery, here, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ludovico, who hurried me into this chamber, and locked me up to keep me out of harm, as he &s;aid. But he was in &s;uch a hur|ry him&s;elf, he hardly &s;poke ten words, but he told me he would come, and let me out, when all was quiet, and he took away the key with him. Now all the&s;e hours are pa&s;&s;ed, and I have nei|ther &s;een, or heard a word of him; they have murdered him&mdash;I know they have!"</P>
<P>Emily &s;uddenly remembered the wounded per&s;on, whom &s;he had &s;een borne into the &s;ervants' hall, and &s;he &s;carcely doubted, that he was Ludovico, but &s;he concealed the circum&s;tance from Annette, and endeavoured to comfort her. Then, impatient to learn &s;omething of her aunt, &s;he again inquired the way to the turret.</P>
<P>"O! you are not going, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "for Heaven's &s;ake, do not go, and leave me here by my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Nay, Annette, you do not think I can wait in the gallery all night," replied Emily. "Direct me to the turret; in the morning I will endeavour to relea&s;e you."</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="029378_0166_0FE082C83874E950">
"O holy Mary!" exclaimed Annette, "am I to &s;tay here by my&s;elf all night! I &s;hall be frightened out of my &s;en&s;es, and I &s;hall die of hunger; I have had nothing to eat &s;ince dinner!"</P>
<P>Emily could &s;carcely forbear &s;miling at the heterogeneous di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of Annette, though &s;he &s;incerely pitied them, and &s;aid what &s;he could to &s;ooth her. At length, &s;he obtained &s;omething like a direction to the ea&s;t turret, and quitted the door, from whence, after many intricacies, and perplexities, &s;he reached the &s;teep and winding &s;tairs of the turret, at the foot of which &s;he &s;topped to re&s;t, and to reanimate her courage with a &s;en&s;e of her duty. As &s;he &s;urveyed this di&s;mal place, &s;he perceived a door on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;tairca&s;e, and, anxious to know whether it would lead her to Madame Montoni, &s;he tried to undraw the bolts, which fa&s;tened it. A fre&s;her air came to her face, as &s;he un|clo&s;ed the door, which opened upon the ea&s;t rampart, and the &s;udden current had nearly extingui&s;hed her light, which &s;he now removed to a di&s;tance; and again, looking out upon the ob&s;cure terrace, &s;he perceived only the faint outline of the walls and of &s;ome towers, while, above, heavy clouds, borne along the wind, &s;eemed to mingle with the &s;tars, and wrap the night in thicker darkne&s;s. As &s;he gazed, now willing to defer the moment of certainty, from which &s;he expected only confirmation of evil, a di&s;tant foot&s;tep reminded her, that &s;he might be ob&s;erved by the men on watch; and, ha&s;tily clo&s;ing the door, &s;he took her lamp, and pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;tairca&s;e. Trembling came upon her, as &s;he a&s;cended through the gloom. To her melancholy fancy this &s;eemed to be a place of death, and the chilling &s;ilence, that reigned, confirmed its character. Her &s;pirits faltered. "Per|haps," &s;aid &s;he, "I am come hither only to learn a dreadful truth, or to witne&s;s &s;ome horrible &s;pectacle; I feel that my &s;en|&s;es would not &s;urvive &s;uch an addition of horror."</P>
<P>The image of her aunt murdered&mdash;murdered, perhaps, by the hand of Montoni, ro&s;e to her mind; &s;he trembled, ga&s;ped for breath&mdash;repented that &s;he had dared to venture hither, and checked her &s;teps. But, after &s;he had pau&s;ed a few minutes, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her duty returned, and &s;he went on. Still all was &s;ilent. At length a track of blood, upon a &s;tair, caught her eye; and in&s;tantly &s;he perceived, that the wall and &s;everal other &s;teps were &s;tained. She pau&s;ed, again &s;truggled to &s;upport her&s;elf, and the lamp almo&s;t fell from her trembling hand.&mdash;Still no &s;ound was heard, no living being &s;eemed to inhabit the turret; a thou&s;and times &s;he wi&s;hed her&s;elf again in her cham|ber; dreaded to inquire farther&mdash;dreaded to encounter &s;ome hor|rible

&s;pectacle, and yet could not re&s;olve, now that &s;he was &s;o near the termination of her efforts, to de&s;i&s;t from them. Having again recollected courage to proceed, after a&s;cending about half way up the turret, &s;he came to another door, but here again &s;he &s;topped in he&s;itation; li&s;tened for &s;ounds within, and then, &s;um|moning all her re&s;olution, unclo&s;ed it, and entered a chamber, which, as her lamp &s;hot its feeble rays through the darkne&s;s, &s;eemed to exhibit only dew-&s;tained and de&s;erted walls. As &s;he &s;tood examining it, in fearful expectation of di&s;covering the re|mains of her unfortunate aunt, &s;he perceived &s;omething lying in an ob&s;cure corner of the room, and &s;truck with an horrible convic|tion, &s;he became, for an in&s;tant, motionle&s;s and nearly in&s;en&s;ible. Then, with a kind of de&s;perate re&s;olution, &s;he hurried towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he object that excited her terror, when, perceiving the clothes of &s;ome per&s;on, on the floor, the caught hold of them, and found in her gra&s;p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he old uniform of a &s;oldier, beneath which appear|ed a heap of pikes and other arms. Scarcely daring to tru&s;t her &s;ight, &s;he continued, for &s;ome moments, to gaze on the object of her late alarm, and then left the chamber, &s;o much comforted and occupied by the conviction, that her aunt was not there, that &s;he was going to de&s;cend the turret, without inquiring far|ther; when, on turning to do &s;o, &s;he ob&s;erved upon &s;ome &s;teps on the &s;econd flight an appearance of blood, and remembering, that there was yet another chamber to be explored, &s;he again followed the windings of the a&s;cent. Still, as &s;he a&s;cended, the track of blood glared upon the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>It led her to the door of a landing place, that terminated them, but &s;he was unable to follow it farther. Now that &s;he was &s;o near the &s;ought-for certainty, &s;he dreaded to know it, even more than before, and had not fortitude &s;ufficient to &s;peak, or to attempt opening the door.</P>
<P>Having li&s;tened in vain, for &s;ome &s;ound, that might confirm or de&s;troy her fears, &s;he, at length, laid her hand on the lock, and, finding it fa&s;tened, called on Madame Montoni; but only a chilling &s;ilence en&s;ued.</P>
<P>"She is dead!" &s;he cried,&mdash;"murdered!&mdash;her blood is on the &s;tairs!"</P>
<P>Emily grew very faint; could &s;upport her&s;elf no longer, and had &s;carcely pre&s;ence of mind to &s;et down the lamp, and place her+&s;elf on a &s;tep.</P>
<P>When her recollection returned, &s;he &s;poke again at the door, and again attempted to open it, and, having lingered for &s;ome|time without receiving any an&s;wer, or hearing a &s;ound, &s;he de|&s;cended
<PB N="107" REF="029378_0167_0FE082D3ECBB6698">
the turret, and, with all the &s;wiftne&s;s her feeblene&s;s would permit &s;ought her own apartment.</P>
<P>As &s;he turned into the corridor, the door of a chamber open|ed, from whence Montoni came forth; but Emily, more terri|fied than ever to behold him, &s;hrunk back into the pa&s;&s;age &s;oon enough to e&s;cape being noticed, and heard him clo&s;e the door, which &s;he had perceived was the &s;ame &s;he formerly ob&s;erved. Having here li&s;tened to his departing &s;teps, till their faint &s;ound was lo&s;t in di&s;tance, &s;he ventured to her apartment, and, &s;ecuring it once again, retired to her bed, leaving the lamp burning on the hearth. But &s;leep was fled from her hara&s;&s;ed mind, to which images of horror alone occurred. She endeavoured to think it po&s;&s;ible, that Madame Montoni had not been taken to the turret; but, when &s;he recollected the former menaces of her hu&s;band and the terrible &s;pirit of vengeance, which he had di&s;|played on the late occa&s;ion; when &s;he remembered his general character, the looks of the men, who had forced Madame Mon|toni from her apartment, and the written traces on the &s;tairs of the turret&mdash;&s;he could not doubt, that her aunt had been carried thither, and could &s;carcely hope, that &s;he had not been carried to be murdered.</P>
<P>The gray of morning had long dawned through her ca&s;ements, before Emily clo&s;ed her eyes in &s;leep; when wearied nature, at length, yielded her a re&s;pite from &s;uffering.</P>

<P>EMILY remained in her chamber, on the following morning, without receiving any notice from Montoni, or &s;eeing a human being, except the armed men, who &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed on the ter|race below. Having ta&s;ted no food &s;ince the dinner of the pre|ceding day, extreme faintne&s;s made her feel the nece&s;&s;ity of quitting the a&s;&s;ylum of her apartment to obtain refre&s;hment, and &s;he was al&s;o very anxious to procure liberty for Annette. Wil|ling, however, to defer venturing forth, as long as po&s;&s;ible, and con&s;idering, whether &s;he &s;hould apply to Montoni, or to the com|pa&s;&s;ion

of &s;ome other per&s;on, her exce&s;&s;ive anxiety concerning her aunt, at length, overcame her abhorrence of his pre&s;ence, and &s;he determined to go to him, and to entreat, that he would &s;uf|fer her to &s;ee Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, it was too certain, from the ab&s;ence of Annette, that &s;ome accident had befallen Ludovico, and that &s;he was &s;till in confinement; Emily, therefore, re&s;olved al&s;o to vi&s;it the chamber, where &s;he had &s;poken to her, on the preceding night, and, if the poor girl was yet there, to inform Montoni of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>It was near noon, before &s;he ventured from her apartment, and went fir&s;t to the &s;outh gallery, whither &s;he pa&s;&s;ed without meeting a &s;ingle per&s;on, or hearing a &s;ound, except, now and then, the echo of a di&s;tant foot&s;tep.</P>
<P>It was unnece&s;&s;ary to call Annette, who&s;e lamentations were audible upon the fir&s;t approach to the gallery, and who, bewail|ing her own and Ludovico's fate, told Emily, that &s;he &s;hould certainly be &s;tarved to death, if &s;he was not let out immediately. Emily replied, that &s;he was going to beg her relea&s;e of Montoni; but the terrors of hunger now yielded to tho&s;e of the Signor, and, when Emily left her, &s;he was loudly entreating, that her place of refuge might be concealed from him.</P>
<P>As Emily drew near the great hall, the &s;ounds &s;he heard and the people &s;he met in the pa&s;&s;ages renewed her alarm. The lat|ter, however, were peaceable, and did not interrupt her, though they looked earne&s;tly at her, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes &s;poke. On cro&s;&s;ing the hall towards the cedar room, where Montoni u&s;ually &s;at, &s;he perceived on the pavement, fragments of &s;words, &s;ome tattered garments &s;tained with blood, and almo&s;t expected to have &s;een among them a dead body; but from &s;uch a &s;pecta|cle &s;he was, at pre&s;ent, &s;pared. As &s;he approached the room, the &s;ound of &s;everal voices i&s;&s;ued from within, and a dread of appearing before many &s;trangers, as well as of irritating Montoni by &s;uch an intru&s;ion, made her pau&s;e and falter from her purpo&s;e. She looked up through the long arcades of the hall, in &s;earch of a &s;ervant, who might bear a me&s;&s;age, but no one appeared, and the urgency of what &s;he had to reque&s;t made her &s;till linger near the door. The voices within were not in contention, though &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e of &s;everal of the gue&s;ts of the preceding day; but &s;till her re&s;olution &s;ailed, whenever &s;he would have tapped at the door, and &s;he had determined to walk in the hall, till &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould appear, who might call Montoni from the room, when, as &s;he turned from the door, it was &s;uddenly opened by

him&s;elf. Emily trembled, and was confu&s;ed, while he almo&s;t &s;tarted with &s;urpri&s;e, and all the terrors of his countenance un|folded them&s;elves. She forgot all &s;he would have &s;aid, and neither inquired for her aunt, nor entreated for Annette, but &s;tood &s;ilent and embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After clo&s;ing the door he reproved her for a meanne&s;s, of which &s;he had not been guilty, and &s;ternly que&s;tioned her what &s;he had overheard; an accu&s;ation, which revived her recollec|tion &s;o far, that &s;he a&s;&s;ured him &s;he had not come thither with an intention to li&s;ten to his conver&s;ation, but to entreat his com|pa&s;&s;ion for her aunt, and for Annette. Montoni &s;eemed to doubt this a&s;&s;ertion, for he regarded her with a &s;crutinizing look; and the doubt evidently aro&s;e from no trifling intere&s;t. Emily then further explained her&s;elf, and concluded with entreating him to inform her, where her aunt was placed, and to permit, that &s;he might vi&s;it her; but he looked upon her only with a malignant &s;mile, which in&s;tantaneou&s;ly confirmed her wor&s;t fears for her aunt, and, at that moment &s;he had not courage to renew her entreaties.</P>
<P>"For Annette," &s;aid he,&mdash;"if you go to Carlo, he will relea&s;e the girl; the fooli&s;h fellow, who &s;hut her up, died ye&s;terday." Emily &s;huddered.&mdash;"But my aunt, Signor"&mdash;&s;aid &s;he," O tell me of my aunt!"</P>
<P>"She is taken care of," replied Montoni ha&s;tily, "I have no time to an&s;wer idle que&s;tions."</P>
<P>He would have pa&s;&s;ed on, but Emily, in a voice of agony, that could not be wholly re&s;i&s;ted, conjured him to tell her, where Madame Montoni was; while he pau&s;ed, and &s;he anxiou&s;ly watched his countenance, a trumpet &s;ounded, and, in the next moment, &s;he heard the heavy gates of the portal open, and then the clattering of hor&s;es' hoofs in the court, with the confu&s;ion of many voices. She &s;tood for a moment he&s;itating whether &s;he &s;hould follow Montoni, who, at the &s;ound of the trumpet had pa&s;&s;ed through the hall, and, turning her eyes whence it came, &s;he &s;aw through the door, that opened beyond a long per&s;pective of arches into the courts, a party of hor&s;emen, whom &s;he judged, as well as the di&s;tance and her embarra&s;&s;ment would allow, to be the &s;ame &s;he had &s;een depart, a few days before. But &s;he &s;taid not to &s;crutinize, for, when the trumpet &s;ounded again, the chevaliers ru&s;hed out of the cedar room, and men came running into the hall from every quarter of the ca&s;tle. Emily once more hurried for &s;helter to her own apartment. Thither &s;he was &s;till pur&s;ued by images of horror. She recon&s;idered Montoni's man|ner

and words, when he had &s;poken of his wife, and they &s;erved only to confirm her mo&s;t terrible &s;u&s;picions. Tears refu&s;ed any longer to relieve her di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he had &s;at for a con&s;idera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ab&s;orbed in thought, when a knocking at the chamber door arou&s;ed her, on opening which &s;he found old Carlo.</P>
<P>"Dear young lady," &s;aid he, "I have been &s;o flurried, I never once thought of you till ju&s;t now. I have brought you &s;ome fruit and wine, and I am &s;ure you mu&s;t &s;tand in need of them by this time."</P>
<P>"Thank you Carlo," &s;aid Emily, "this is very good of you. Did the Signor remind you of me?"</P>
<P>"No, Signora," replied Carlo, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is <HI>Excellenza</HI> has bu&s;ine&s;s enough on his hands." Emily then renewed her inquiries, con|cerning Madame Montoni, but Carlo had been employed at the other end of the ca&s;tle during the time, that &s;he was removed, and he had heard nothing &s;ince concerning her.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke, Emily looked &s;teadily at him, for &s;he &s;carce|ly knew whether he was really ignorant, or concealed his know|ledge of the truth from a fear of offending his ma&s;ter. To &s;e|veral que&s;tions, concerning the contentions of ye&s;terday, he gave very limited an&s;wers: but told, that the di&s;putes were now ami|cably &s;ettled, and that the Signor believed him&s;elf to have been mi&s;taken in his &s;u&s;picions of his gue&s;ts. "The fighting was about that, Signors," &s;aid Carlo; "but I tru&s;t I &s;hall never &s;ee &s;uch another day in this ca&s;tle, though &s;trange things are about to be done."</P>
<P>On her inquiring his meaning, "Ah, Signora!" added he, "it is not for me to betray &s;ecrets, or tell all I think, but time will tell."</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired him to relea&s;e Annette, and, having de&s;cribed the chamber in which the poor girl was confined, he promi&s;ed to obey her immediately, and was departing, when &s;he remembered to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who were the per&s;ons ju&s;t arrived. Her late conjecture was right; it was Verezzi wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h his party.</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits were &s;omewhat &s;oothed by this &s;hort conver&s;ation with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for, in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, it afforded &s;ome comfort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o hear the accents of compa&s;&s;ion, and to meet the look of &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>An hour pa&s;&s;ed before Annette appeared, who then came weep|ing and &s;obbing. "O Ludovico&mdash;Ludovico!" cried &s;he.</P>
<P>"My poor Annette!" &s;aid Emily, and made her &s;it down.</P>
<P>"Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ould have fore&s;een this, ma'am&s;elle? O mi&s;erable, wretched, day&mdash;that ever I &s;hould live to &s;ee it!" and &s;he con|tinued

to moan and lament, till Emily thought it nece&s;&s;ary to check her exce&s;s of grief. "We are continually lo&s;ing dear friends by death, "&s;aid &s;he with a &s;igh, that came from her heart. "We mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the will of Heaven&mdash;our tears, alas! can|not recall the dead!"</P>
<P>Annette took the handkerchief from her face.</P>
<P>"You will meet Ludovico in a better world, I hope," added Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes&mdash;yes,&mdash;ma'am&s;elle," &s;obbed Annette, "but I hope I &s;hall meet him again in this&mdash;though he is &s;o wounded!"</P>
<P>"Wounded!" exclaimed Emily, "does he live?"</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am, but&mdash;but he has a terrible wound, and could not come to let me out. They thought him dead, at fir&s;t, and he has not been rightly him&s;elf, till within this hour."</P>
<P>"Well, Annette, I rejoice to hear he lives."</P>
<P>"Lives! Holy Saints! why he will not die, &s;urely!" Emily &s;aid &s;he hoped no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, but this expre&s;&s;ion of hope Annette thought implied fear, and her own increa&s;ed in proportion, as Emily endeavoured to encourage her.

<P>"I quite forgot to a&s;k among the &s;ervants, ma'am&s;elle" &s;aid &s;he, "for I could think of nobody but poor Ludovico."</P>
<P>Annette's grief was now &s;omewhat a&s;&s;uaged, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ent her to make inquiries, concerning her lady, of whom, however, &s;he could obtain no intelligence, &s;ome of the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;poke with being really ignorant of her fate, and others having proba|bly received or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to conceal it.</P>

<P>Two following days pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, unmarked by any occurrence, during which &s;he obtained no information of Madame Montoni. On the evening of the &s;econd, having di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed Annette, and retired to bed, her mind became haunted by the mo&s;t di&s;mal images, &s;uch as her long anxiety, concerning her aunt &s;ugge&s;ted; and, unable to forget her&s;elf for a moment, or to vanqui&s;h the phantoms that tormented her, &s;he ro&s;e from her bed, and went to one of the ca&s;ement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of her chamber, to breathe a freer air.</P>
<P>All without was &s;ilent and dark, unle&s;s that could be called light, which was only the faint glimmer of the &s;tars, &s;hewing imperfectly the outline of the mountains, the we&s;tern towers of

the ca&s;tle and the ramparts below, where a &s;olitary &s;entinel was pacing. What an image of repo&s;e did this &s;cene pre&s;ent!

<P>They brought a retro&s;pect of all the &s;trange and mournful events, which had occurred &s;ince &s;he lived in peace with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> parents.

Her &s;urpri&s;e, on hearing &s;uch &s;oothing and delicious &s;ounds, was, at lea&s;t, ju&s;tifiable; for it was long&mdash;very long, &s;ince &s;he had li&s;tened to any thing like melody.

<P>When her mind was &s;omewhat more compo&s;ed, &s;he tried to a&s;certain from what quarter the &s;ounds proceeded, and thought they came from below; but whether from a room of the ca&s;tle, or from the terrace, &s;he could not with certainty judge.

She remembered the &s;ingular event, connected with the ca&s;tle, which had given it into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its pre|&s;ent owner; and, when &s;he con&s;idered the my&s;terious manner, in which its late po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or had di&s;appeared, and that &s;he had never &s;ince been heard of, her mind was impre&s;&s;ed with an high degree of &s;olemn awe; &s;o that, though there appeared no clue to connect that event with the late mu&s;ic, &s;he was inclined fan|cifully to think they had &s;ome relation to each other.

But he is come abroad now, for I met him on the rampart ju&s;t this minute.

<P>"O, it was Signor Or&s;ino, then!" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am&s;elle, Signor Or&s;ino, him&s;elf, who cau&s;ed that Venetian gentleman to be killed, and has been popping about from place to place, ever &s;ince, as I hear."</P>

<P>"O yes, ma'am&s;elle there is Benedetto plays the great drum to admiration; and then, there is Launcelot the trumpeter; nay, for that matter, Ludovico him&s;elf can play on the trumpet;&mdash;but he is ill now. I remember once"&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily interrupted her; "Have you heard no other mu&s;ic &s;ince you came to the ca&s;tle&mdash;none la&s;t night?"</P>
<P>"Why, did <HI>you</HI> hear any la&s;t night, ma'am&s;elle?"</P>
<P>Emily evaded this que&s;tion, by repeating her own.</P>
<P>"Why, no, ma'am," replied Annette; "I never heard any mu&s;ic here, I mu&s;t &s;ay, but the drums and the trumpet; and, as for la&s;t night, I did nothing but dream I &s;aw my late lady's gho&s;t."</P>
<P>"Your <HI>late</HI> lady's," &s;aid Emily in a tremulous voice; "you have heard more, then. Tell me&mdash;tell me all, Annette, I en|treat; tell me the wor&s;t at once."</P>
<P>"Nay, ma'am&s;elle, you know the wor&s;t already."</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="029378_0172_0FE0830471C42490">
"I know nothing," &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, you do, ma'am&s;elle; you know, that nobody knows any thing about her; and it is plain, therefore, &s;he is gone, the way of the fir&s;t lady of the ca&s;tle&mdash;nobody ever knew any thing about her."</P>
<P>Emily leaned her head upon her hand, and was, for &s;ometime, &s;ilent; then, telling Annette &s;he wi&s;hed to be alone, the latter left the room.</P>
<P>The remark of Annette had revived Emily's terrible &s;u&s;picion concerning the fate of Madame Montoni; and &s;he re&s;olved to make another effort to obtain certainty on this &s;ubject, by apply|ing to Montoni once more.</P>
<P>When Annette returned a few hours after, &s;he told Emily, that the porter of the ca&s;tle wi&s;hed very much to &s;peak with her, for that he had &s;omething of importance to &s;ay; her &s;pirits had, however, of late been &s;o &s;ubject to alarm, that any new circum|&s;tance excited it; and this me&s;&s;age from the porter, when her fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e was over, made her look round for &s;ome lurking danger, the more &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly, perhaps, becau&s;e &s;he had frequently re|marked the unplea&s;ant air and countenance of this man. She now he&s;itated, whether to &s;peak with him, doubting even, that this reque&s;t was only a pretext to draw her into &s;ome danger; but a little reflection &s;hewed her the improbability of this, and &s;he blu&s;hed at her weak fears.</P>
<P>"I will &s;peak to him, Annette," &s;aid &s;he; "de&s;ire him to come to the corridor immediately."</P>
<P>Annette departed, and &s;oon after returned.</P>
<P>"Barnardine, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, "dare not come to the corridor, le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;covered, it is &s;o far from his po&s;t; and he dare not even leave the gates for a moment now; but, if you will come to him at the portal, through &s;ome roundabout pa&s;&s;ages he told me of, without cro&s;&s;ing the courts, he has that to tell, which will &s;urpri&s;e you. But you mu&s;t not come through the courts, le&s;t the Signor &s;hould &s;ee you."</P>
<P>Emily, neither approving the&s;e "roundabout pa&s;&s;ages," no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the other part of the reque&s;t, now po&s;itively refu&s;ed to go. "Tell him." &s;aid &s;he, "if he has any thing of con&s;equence to impart, I will hear him in the corridor, whenever he has an opportuni|ty of coming thither."</P>
<P>Annette went to deliver this me&s;&s;age, and was ab&s;ent a con|&s;iderable time. When &s;he returned, "It won't do, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he. "Barnardine has been con&s;idering all this time what can be done, for it is as much as his place is worth to leave his
<PB N="117" REF="029378_0172_0FE0830471C42490">
po&s;t now. But, if you will come to the ea&s;t rampart in the du&s;k of the evening, he can, perhaps, &s;teal away, and tell you all he has to &s;ay."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed, at the &s;ecrecy which this man &s;eemed to think &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and he&s;itated whether to meet him, till, con&s;idering, that he might mean to warn her of &s;ome &s;erious danger, &s;he re&s;olved to go.</P>
<P>"Soon after &s;un&s;et," &s;aid &s;he, "I will be at the end of the ea&s;t rampart. But then the watch will be &s;et," &s;he added re|collecting her&s;elf, "and how can Barnardine pa&s;s unob&s;erved?"</P>
<P>"That is ju&s;t what I &s;aid to him, ma'am, and he an&s;wered me, that he had the key of the gate, at the end of the rampart, that leads towards the courts, and could let him&s;elf through that way; and as for the &s;entinels, there were none at this end of the terrace, becau&s;e the place is guarded enough by the high walls of the ca&s;tle, and the ea&s;t turret; and he &s;aid tho&s;e at the other end were too far off to &s;ee him, if it was pretty du&s;kyi&s;h."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Emily, "I mu&s;t hear what he has to tell; and, therefore, de&s;ire you will go with me to the terrace, this evening."</P>
<P>"He de&s;ired it might be pretty du&s;kyi&s;h, ma'am&s;elle," re|peated Annette, "becau&s;e of the watch."</P>
<P>Emily pau&s;ed, and then &s;aid &s;he would be on the terrace, an hour after &s;un&s;et; "and tell Barnardine," &s;he added, "to be punctual to the time; for that I, al&s;o, may be ob&s;erved by Signor Montoni. Where is the Signor? I would &s;peak with him."</P>
<P>"He is in the cedar chamber, ma'am, coun&s;elling with the other Signors. He is going to give them a &s;ort of a treat to-day, to make up for what pa&s;&s;ed at the la&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e; the people are all very bu&s;y in the kitchen."</P>
<P>Emily now inquired, if Montoni expected any new gue&s;ts? and Annette believed that he did not. "Poor Ludovico!" added &s;he, "he would be as merry as the be&s;t of them, if he was well; but he may recover yet. Count Morano was wounded as bad, as he, and he has got well again, and is gone back to Venice."</P>
<P>"Is he &s;o?" &s;aid Emily, "when did you hear this?"</P>
<P>"I heard it, la&s;t night, ma'am&s;elle, but I forgot to tell it."</P>
<P>Emily a&s;ked &s;ome further que&s;tions, and then, de&s;iring Annette would ob&s;erve and inform her, when Montoni was alone, the girl went to deliver her me&s;&s;age to Barnardine.</P>
<P>Montoni was, however, &s;o much engaged, during the whole day, that Emily had no opportunity of &s;eeking a relea&s;e from her terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e, concerning her aunt. Annette was employed in watching his &s;teps, and in attending upon Ludovico, whom
<PB N="118" REF="029378_0173_0FE08311DB7D9900">
&s;he, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Caterina, nur&s;ed with the utmo&s;t care; and Emily was, of cour&s;e, left much alone. Her thoughts dwelt often on the me&s;&s;age of the porter, and were employed in conjecturing the &s;ubject, that occa&s;ioned it, which &s;he &s;ometimes imagined concerned the fate of Madame Montoni; at others, that it re|lated to &s;ome per&s;onal danger, which threatened her&s;elf. The cautious &s;ecrecy which Barnardine ob&s;erved in his conduct, in|clined her to believe the latter.</P>
<P>As the hour of appointment drew near, her impatience in|crea&s;ed. At length, the &s;un &s;et; &s;he heard the pa&s;&s;ing &s;teps of the &s;entinels going to their po&s;ts; and waited only for Annette to accompany her to the terrace, who, &s;oon after, came, and they de&s;cended together. When Emily expre&s;&s;ed apprehen&s;ions of meeting Montoni, or &s;ome of his gue&s;ts, "O, there is no fear of that, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "they are all &s;et in to fea&s;ting yet, and that Barnardine knows."</P>
<P>They reached the fir&s;t terrace, where the &s;entinels demanded who pa&s;&s;ed; and Emily, having an&s;wered, walked on to the ea&s;t rampart, at the entrance of which they were again &s;topped; and, having again replied, were permitted to proceed. But Emily did not like to expo&s;e her&s;elf to the di&s;cretion of the&s;e men, at &s;uch an hour; and, impatient to withdraw from the &s;ituation, &s;he &s;tepped ha&s;tily on in &s;earch of Barnardine. He was not yet come. She leaned pen&s;ively on the wall of the rampart, and waited for him. The gloom of twilight &s;at deep on the &s;ur|rounding objects, blending in &s;oft confu&s;ion the valley, the moun|tains and the woods, who&s;e tall heads, &s;tirred by the evening breeze, gave the only &s;ounds, that &s;tole on &s;ilence, except a faint, faint chorus of di&s;tant voices, that aro&s;e from within the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"What voices are tho&s;e?" &s;aid Emily, as &s;he fearfully li&s;tened.</P>
<P>"It is only the Signor and his gue&s;ts carou&s;ing," replied An|nette.</P>
<P>"Good God!" thought Emily, "can this man's heart be &s;o gay, when he has made another being &s;o wretched; if, indeed, my aunt is yet &s;uffered to feel her wretchedne&s;s? O! whatever are my own &s;ufferings, may my heart never, never be hardened again&s;t tho&s;e of others!"</P>
<P>She looked up, with a &s;en&s;ation of horror, to the ea&s;t turret, near which &s;he then &s;tood! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> light glimmered through the grates of the lower chamber, but tho&s;e of the upper one were dark. Pre&s;ently, &s;he perceived a per&s;on moving with a lamp acro&s;s the lower room; but this circum&s;tance revived no hope, concerning Madame Montoni, whom &s;he had vainly &s;ought in
<PB N="119" REF="029378_0173_0FE08311DB7D9900">
that apartment, which had appeared to contain only &s;oldiers' ac|coutrements. Emily, however, determined to attempt the outer door of the turret, as &s;oon as Barnardine &s;hould withdraw; and, if it was unfa&s;tened, to make another effort to di&s;cover her aunt.</P>
<P>The moments pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;till Barnardine did not appear; and Emily, becoming unea&s;y, he&s;itated whether to wait any longer. She would have &s;ent Annette to the portal to ha&s;ten him, but feared to be left alone, for it was now almo&s;t dark, and a melan|choly &s;treak of red, that &s;till lingered in the we&s;t, was the only ve&s;tige of departed day. The &s;trong intere&s;t, however, which Barnardine's me&s;&s;age had awakened, overcame other apprehen|&s;ions, and &s;till detained her.</P>
<P>While &s;he was conjecturing with Annette what could thus oc|ca&s;ion his ab&s;ence, they heard a key turn in the lock of the gate near them, and pre&s;ently &s;aw a man advancing. It was Barnar|dine, of whom Emily ha&s;tily inquired what he had to communi|cate, and de&s;ired, that he would tell her quickly, "for I am chill|ed with this evening air," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s your maid, lady," &s;aid the man in a voice, the deep tone of which &s;hocked her, "what I have to tell is to you only."</P>
<P>Emily, after &s;ome he&s;itation, de&s;ired Annette to withdraw to a little di&s;tance. "Now, my friend, what would you &s;ay?"</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent a moment, as if con&s;idering, and then &s;aid,&mdash;</P>
<P>"That which would co&s;t me my place, at lea&s;t, if it came to the Signor's ears. You mu&s;t promi&s;e, lady, that nothing &s;hall ever make you tell a &s;yllable of the matter; I have been tru&s;ted in this affair, and, if it was known, that I betrayed my tru&s;t, my life, perhaps, might an&s;wer it. But I was concerned for you, lady, and I re&s;olved to tell you." He pau&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily thanked him, a&s;&s;ured him that he might repo&s;e on her di&s;cretion, and entreated him to di&s;patch.</P>
<P>"Annette told us in the hall how unhappy you was about Signora Montoni, and how much you wi&s;hed to know what was become of her."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t true," &s;aid Emily eagerly, "and you can inform me. I conjure you tell me the wor&s;t, without he&s;itation." She re&s;ted her trembling arm upon the wall.</P>
<P>"I can tell you," &s;aid Barnardine, and pau&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily had no power to enforce her entreaties.</P>
<P>"I <HI>can</HI> tell you," re&s;umed Barnardine,&mdash;"but"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But what?" exclaimed Emily, recovering her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>"Here I am, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, who, having heard
<PB N="120" REF="029378_0174_0FE08316A2C0A310">
the eager tone, in which Emily pronounced the&s;e words, came running towards her.</P>
<P>"Retire!" &s;aid Barnardine, &s;ternly, "you are not wanted;" and, as Emily &s;aid nothing, Annette obeyed.</P>
<P>"I <HI>can</HI> tell you," repeated the porter.&mdash;" but I know not how, you was afflicted before."&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am prepared for the wor&s;t, my friend," &s;aid Emily, in a firm and &s;olemn voice. "I can &s;upport any certainty better than this &s;u&s;pen&s;e."</P>
<P>"Well, Signora, if that is the ca&s;e, you &s;hall hear.&mdash;You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the Signor and his lady u&s;ed &s;ometimes to di&s;agree. It is none of my concerns to inquire what it was about, but I believe you know it was &s;o."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Emily, "proceed."</P>
<P>"The Signor, it &s;eems, had lately been very wrath again&s;t her. I &s;aw all, and heard all,&mdash;a great deal more than people thought for; but it was none of my bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o I &s;aid nothing. A few days ago, the Signor &s;ent for me. 'Barnardine,' &s;ays he, 'you are&mdash;an hone&s;t man, I think I can tru&s;t you.'&mdash;I a&s;&s;ured his <HI>Excellenza</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e could. 'Then,' &s;ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, as near as I can remember, 'I have an affair in hand, which I want you to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in.'&mdash;Then he told me what I was to do but that I &s;hall &s;ay nothing about&mdash;it concerned only the Signora."</P>
<P>"O heavens!" exclaimed Emily&mdash;"what have you done?"</P>
<P>Barnardine he&s;itated, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"What fiend could tempt him, or you, to &s;uch an act!" cried Emily, chilled with horror, and &s;carcely able to &s;upport her fainting &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"It was a fiend," &s;aid Barnardine in a gloomy tone of voice. They were now both &s;ilent;&mdash;Emily had not courage to inquire further, and Barnardine &s;eemed to &s;hrink from telling more. At length he &s;aid, "It is of no u&s;e to think of the pa&s;t; the Sig|nor was cruel enough, but he would be obeyed. What &s;ignified my refu&s;ing? He would have found others, who had no &s;cruples."</P>
<P>"You have murdered her, then!" &s;aid Emily, in a hallow and inward voice&mdash;"I am talking with a murderer!" Barnar|dine &s;tood &s;ilent; while Emily turned from him, and attempted to leave the place.</P>
<P>"Stay, lady!" &s;aid he "you de&s;erve to think &s;o &s;till&mdash;&s;ince you can believe me capable of &s;uch a deed."</P>
<P>"If you are innocent, tell me quickly," &s;aid Emily, in faint accents, "for I feel I &s;hall not be able to hear you long."</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="029378_0174_0FE08316A2C0A310">
"I will tell you no more," &s;aid he, and walked away. Emi|ly had ju&s;t &s;trength enough to bid him &s;tay, and then to call Annette, on who&s;e arm &s;he leaned, and they walked &s;lowly up the rampart, till they heard &s;teps behind them. It was Barnar|dine again.</P>
<P>"Send away the girl," &s;aid he, "and I will tell you more."</P>
<P>"She mu&s;t not go" &s;aid Emily; "what you have to &s;ay &s;he may hear."</P>
<P>"May &s;he &s;o, lady?" &s;aid he. "You &s;hall know no more, then;" and he was going, though &s;lowly, when Emily's anxiety, overcoming the re&s;entment and fear, which the man's behaviour had rou&s;ed, &s;he de&s;ired him to &s;tay, and bade Annette retire.</P>
<P>"The Signora is alive," &s;aid he, "for me. She is my pri|&s;oner, though; his <HI>Excellenza</HI> has &s;hut her up in the chamber over the great gates of the court, and I have the charge of her. I was going to have told you, you might &s;ee her&mdash;but now&mdash;"</P>
<P>Emily, relieved from an unutterable load of angui&s;h by this &s;peech, had now only to a&s;k Barnardine's forgivene&s;s, and to conjure, that he would let her vi&s;it her aunt.</P>
<P>He complied with le&s;s reluctance, than &s;he expected, and told her, that, if &s;he would repair, on the following night, when the Signor was retired to re&s;t, to the po&s;tern gate of the ca&s;tle, &s;he &s;hould, perhaps, &s;ee Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>Amid all the thankfulne&s;s, which Emily felt for this conce&s;|&s;ion, &s;he thought &s;he ob&s;erved a malicious triumph in his man|ner, when he pronounced the la&s;t words; but, in the next mo|ment, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the thought, and, having again thanked him, commended her aunt to his pity, and a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he would her&s;elf reward him, and would be punctual to her ap|pointment; &s;he bade him good night, and retired, unob&s;erved, to her chamber. It was a con&s;iderable time, before the tumult of joy, which Barnardine's unexpected intelligence had occa&s;ion|ed, allowed Emily to think with clearne&s;s, or to be con&s;cious of the real dangers, that &s;till &s;urrounded Madame Montoni and her&s;elf. When this agitation &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he perceived, that her aunt was yet the pri&s;oner of a man, to who&s;e vengeance, or av|arice, &s;he might fall a &s;acrifice; and, when &s;he further con&s;ider|ed the &s;avage a&s;pect of the per&s;on who was appointed to guard Madame Montoni, her doom appeared to be already &s;ealed, for the countenance of Barnardine &s;eemed to bear the &s;tamp of a murderer; and, when &s;he had looked upon it, &s;he felt inclined to believe, that there was no deed, however black, which he
<PB N="122" REF="029378_0175_0FE08322DE911E78">
might not be prevailed upon to execute. The&s;e reflections brought to her remembrance the tone of voice, in which he had promi&s;ed to grant her reque&s;t to &s;ee his pri&s;oner; and &s;he mu&s;ed upon it long in unea&s;ine&s;s and doubt. Sometimes, &s;he even he&s;itated, whether to tru&s;t her&s;elf with him at the lonely hour he had ap|pointed; and once, and only once, it &s;truck her, that Madame Montoni might be already murdered, and that this ruffian was appointed to decoy her&s;elf to &s;ome &s;ecret place, where her life al&s;o was to be &s;acrificed to the avarice of Montoni, who then would claim &s;ecurely the conte&s;ted e&s;tates in Languedoc. The con&s;ideration of the enormity of &s;uch guilt did, at length, relieve her from the belief of its probability, but not from all the doubts and fears, which a recollection of Barnardine's manner had oc|ca&s;ioned. From the&s;e &s;ubjects, her thoughts, at length, pa&s;&s;ed to others; and, as the evening advanced, &s;he remembered, with &s;omewhat more than &s;urpri&s;e, the mu&s;ic &s;he had heard, on the preceding night, and now awaited its return, with more than curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>She di&s;tingui&s;hed, till a late hour, the di&s;tant carou&s;als of Mon|toni and his companions&mdash;the loud conte&s;t, the di&s;&s;olute laugh and the choral &s;ong, that made the halls re-echo. At length, &s;he heard the heavy gates of the ca&s;tle &s;hut for the night, and tho&s;e &s;ounds in&s;tantly &s;unk into a &s;ilence, which was di&s;turbed only by the whi&s;pering &s;teps of per&s;ons, pa&s;&s;ing through the galle|ries to their remote rooms. Emily now judging it to be about the time, when &s;he had heard the mu&s;ic, on the preceding night, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Annette, and gently opened the ca&s;ement to watch for its return. The planet &s;he had &s;o particularly noticed, at the recurrence of the mu&s;ic, was not yet ri&s;en; but, with &s;uper&s;titious, weakne&s;s, &s;he kept her eyes fixed on that part of the hemi&s;phere, where it would ri&s;e, almo&s;t expecting, that, when it appeared, the &s;ounds would return. At length, it came, &s;erenely bright, over the ea&s;tern towers of the ca&s;tle. Her heart trembled, when &s;he perceived it, and &s;he had &s;carcely courage to remain at the ca&s;e|ment, le&s;t the returning mu&s;ic &s;hould confirm her terror, and &s;ub|due the little &s;trength &s;he yet retained. The clock &s;oon after &s;truck one, and, knowing this to be about the time, when the &s;ounds had occurred, &s;he &s;at down in a chair, near the ca&s;ement, and endeavoured to compo&s;e her &s;pirits; but the anxiety of expec|tation yet di&s;turbed them. Every thing, however, remained &s;till; &s;he heard only the &s;olitary &s;tep of a &s;entinel, and the lulling mur|mur of the woods below, and &s;he again leaned from the ca&s;ement, and again looked, as if for intelligence, to the planet, which was now ri&s;en high above the towers.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="029378_0175_0FE08322DE911E78">
Emily continued to li&s;ten, but no mu&s;ic came. "Tho&s;e were &s;urely no mortal &s;ounds!" &s;aid &s;he, recollecting their entrancing melody. "No inhabitant of this ca&s;tle could utter &s;uch; and, where is the feeling, that could modulate &s;uch exqui&s;ite expre&s;|&s;ion? We all know, that it has been affirmed cele&s;tial &s;ounds have &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heard on earth.

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pau&s;ed to weep at this recollection.

<P>EMILY was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, on the following day, to find that Annette had heard of Madame Montoni's confinement in the chamber over the portal, as well as of her purpo&s;ed vi&s;it there, on the approaching night. That the circum&s;tance, which Barnardine had &s;o &s;olemnly enjoined her to conceal, he had him|&s;elf told to &s;o indi&s;creet an hearer as Annette, appeared very improbable, though he had now charged her with a me&s;&s;age, concerning the intended interview. He reque&s;ted, that Emily
<PB N="124" REF="029378_0176_0FE08328A0350690">
would meet him, unattended, on the terrace, at a little after mid|night, when he him&s;elf would lead her to the place he had prom|i&s;ed; a propo&s;al from which &s;he immediately &s;hrunk, for a thou&s;and vague fears darted athwart her mind, &s;uch as had tor|mented her on the preceding night, and which &s;he neither knew how to tru&s;t, or to di&s;mi&s;s. It frequently occurred to her, that Barnardine might have deceived her, concerning Madame Mon|toni, who&s;e murderer, perhaps, he really was; and that he had deceived her by order of Montoni, the more ea&s;ily to draw her into &s;ome of the de&s;perate de&s;igns of the latter. The terrible &s;u&s;picion that Madame Montoni no longer lived, thus came, ac|companied by one not le&s;s dreadful for her&s;elf. Unle&s;s the crime by which the aunt had &s;uffered, was in&s;tigated merely by re&s;entment, unconnected with profit, a motive, upon which Mon|toni did not appear very likely to act, its object mu&s;t be unat|tained, till the niece was al&s;o dead, to whom Montoni knew that his wife's e&s;tates mu&s;t de&s;cend. Emily remembered the words, which had informed her, that the conte&s;ted e&s;tates in France would devolve to her, if Madame Montoni died, without con|&s;igning them to her hu&s;band, and the former ob&s;tinate per&s;ever|ance of her aunt made it too probable, that &s;he had, to the la&s;t, withheld them. At this in&s;tant, recollecting Barnardine's man|ner, on the preceding night, &s;he now believed, what &s;he had then fancied, that it expre&s;&s;ed malignant triumph. She &s;huddered at the recollection, which confirmed her fears, and determined not to meet him on the terrace. Soon after, &s;he was inclined to con&s;ider the&s;e &s;u&s;picions as the extravagant exaggerations of a timid and hara&s;&s;ed mind, and could not believe Montoni liable to &s;uch prepo&s;terous depravity as that of de&s;troying, from one motive, his wife and her niece. She blamed her&s;elf for &s;uffering her romantic imagination to carry her &s;o far beyond the bounds of probability, and determined to endeavour to check its rapid flights, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ometimes extend into madne&s;s. Still, however, &s;he &s;hrunk from the thought of meeting Barnardine, on the terrace, at midnight; and &s;till the wi&s;h to be relieved from this terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e, concerning her aunt, to &s;ee her, and to &s;ooth her &s;ufferings, made her he&s;itate what to do.</P>
<P>"Yet how is it po&s;&s;ible, Annette, I can pa&s;s to the terrace at that hour?" &s;aid &s;he, recollecting her&s;elf, "the &s;entinels will &s;top me, and Signor Montoni will hear of the affair."</P>
<P>"O ma'am&s;elle! that is well thought of," replied Annette.&mdash;"That is what Barnardine told me about. He gave me this key, and bade me &s;ay it unlocks the door at the end of the vault|ed
<PB N="125" REF="029378_0176_0FE08328A0350690">
gallery, that opens near the end of the ea&s;t rampart, &s;o that you need not pa&s;s any of the men on watch. He bade me &s;ay, too, that his rea&s;on for reque&s;ting you to come to the terrace was, be|cau&s;e he could take you to the place you want to go to, with|out opening the great doors of the hall, which grate &s;o heavily."</P>
<P>Emily's &s;pirits were &s;omewhat calmed by this explanation, which &s;eemed to be hone&s;tly given to Annette. "But why did he de&s;ire I would come alone, Annette?" &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"Why that was what I a&s;ked him my&s;elf, ma'am&s;elle. Says I, Why is my young lady to come alone?&mdash;Surely I may come with her!&mdash;What harm can <HI>I</HI> do? But he &s;aid 'No&mdash;no&mdash;I tell you not,' in his gruff way. Nay, &s;ays I, I have been tru&s;ted in as great affairs as this, I warrant, and it's a hard matter if I can't keep a &s;ecret now. Still he would &s;ay nothing but&mdash;'No&mdash;no&mdash;no,' Well, &s;ays I, if you will only tru&s;t me, I will tell you a great &s;e|cret, that was told me a month ago, and I have never opened my lips about it yet&mdash;&s;o you need not be afraid of telling me. But all would not do. Then, ma'am&s;elle, I went &s;o far as to offer him a beautiful new &s;equin that Ludovico gave me for a keep &s;ake, and I would not have parted with it for all St. Mar|co's Place; but even that would not do! Now what can be the rea&s;on of this? But I know, you know, ma'am, who you are go|ing to &s;ee."</P>
<P>"Pray did Barnardine tell you this?"</P>
<P>"He! No ma'am&s;elle, that he did not."</P>
<P>Emily inquired who did, but Annette &s;hewed, that &s;he <HI>could</HI> keep a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>During the remainder of the day, Emily's mind was agitated with doubts and fears and contrary determinations, on the &s;ub|ject of meeting this Barnardine on the rampart, and &s;ubmitting her&s;elf to his guidance, &s;he &s;carcely knew whither. Pity for her aunt and anxiety for her&s;elf alternately &s;wayed her determi|nation, and night came, before &s;he had decided upon her conduct. She heard the ca&s;tle clock &s;trike eleven&mdash;twelve&mdash;and yet her mind wavered. The time, however, was now come, when &s;he could he&s;itate no longer: and then the intere&s;t &s;he felt for her aunt overcame other con&s;iderations, and, bidding Annette fol|low her to the outer door of the vaulted gallery, and there await her return, &s;he de&s;cended from her chamber. The ca&s;tle was perfectly &s;till, and the great hall, where &s;o lately &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed a &s;cene of dreadful contention, now returned only the whi&s;pering foot&s;teps of the two &s;olitary figures gliding fearfully between the pillars, and gleamed only to the feeble lamp they
<PB N="126" REF="029378_0177_0FE08335CB876A80">
carried. Emily, deceived by the long &s;hadows of the pillars and by the catching lights between, often &s;topped, imagining &s;he &s;aw &s;ome per&s;on, moving in the di&s;tant ob&s;curity of the per&s;pective; and, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e pillars, &s;he feared to turn her eyes toward them almo&s;t expecting to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a figure &s;tart out from behind their broad &s;haft. She reached, however, the vaulted gallery, with|out interruption, but unclo&s;ed its outer door with a trembling hand, and, charging Annette not to quit it and to keep it a little open, that &s;he might be heard if &s;he called, &s;he delivered to her the lamp, which &s;he did not dare to take her&s;elf becau&s;e of the men on watch, and, alone &s;tepped out upon the dark terrace. Every thing was &s;o &s;till, that &s;he feared, le&s;t her own light &s;teps &s;hould be heard by the di&s;tant &s;entinels, and &s;he walked cauti|ou&s;ly towards the &s;pot where &s;he had before met Barnardine, li&s;tening for a &s;ound, and looking onward through the gloom in &s;earch of him. At length, &s;he was &s;tartled by a deep voice, that &s;poke near her, and &s;he pau&s;ed, uncertain whether it was his, till it &s;poke again, and &s;he then recognized the hollow tones of Bar|nardine, who had been punctual to the moment, and was at the appointed place, re&s;ting on the rampart wall. After chiding her for not coming &s;ooner, and &s;aying, that he had been waiting nearly half an hour, he de&s;ired Emily, who made no reply, to follow him to the door, through which he had entered the terrace.</P>
<P>While he unlocked it, &s;he looked back to that &s;he had left, and, ob&s;erving the rays of the lamp &s;tream through a &s;mall open|ing, was certain, that Annette was &s;till there. But her remote &s;ituation could little befriend Emily, after &s;he had quitted the terrace; and, when Barnardine unclo&s;ed the gate, the di&s;mal a&s;|pect of the pa&s;&s;age beyond, &s;hewn by a torch burning on the pavement, made her &s;hrink from following him alone, and &s;he refu&s;ed to go, unle&s;s Annette might accompany her. This, how|ever, Barnardine ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to permit, mingling at the &s;ame time with his refu&s;al &s;uch artful circum&s;tances to heighten the pity and curio&s;ity of Emily towards her aunt, that &s;he, at length, con&s;ented to follow him alone to the portal.</P>
<P>He then took up the torch, and led her along the pa&s;&s;age, at the extremity of which he unlocked another door, whence they de&s;cended, a few &s;teps, into a chapel, which, as Barnardine held up the torch to light her, Emily ob&s;erved to be in ruins, and &s;he immediately recollected a former conver&s;ation of Annette, concerning it, with very unplea&s;ant emotions. She looked fear|fully on the almo&s;t roofle&s;s walls, green with damps, and on the
<PB N="127" REF="029378_0177_0FE08335CB876A80">
gothic points of the windows, where the ivy and the briony had long &s;upplied the place of gla&s;s, and ran mantling among the broken capitals of &s;ome columns, that had once &s;upported the roof. Barnardine &s;tumbled over the broken pavement, and his voice, as he uttered a &s;udden oath, was returned in hallow echoes, that made it more terrific. Emily's heart &s;unk; but &s;he &s;till followed him, and he turned out of what had been the principal ai&s;le of the chapel. "Down the&s;e &s;teps, lady, "&s;aid Barnardine, as he de&s;cended a flight, which appeared to lead into the vaults; but Emily pau&s;ed on the top, and demanded, in a tremulous tone, whither he was conducting her.</P>
<P>"To the portal," &s;aid Barnardine.</P>
<P>"Cannot we go through the chapel to the portal?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"No, Signora, that leads to the inner court, which I don't choo&s;e to unlock. This way, and we &s;hall reach the outer court pre&s;ently."</P>
<P>Emily &s;till he&s;itated; fearing not only to go on, but, &s;ince &s;he had gone thus far, to irritate Barnardine by refu&s;ing to go further.</P>
<P>"Come, lady," &s;aid the man, who had nearly reached the bottom of the flight, "make a little ha&s;te; I cannot wait here all night."</P>
<P>"Whither do the&s;e &s;teps lead?" &s;aid Emily, yet pau&s;ing.</P>
<P>"To the portal," repeated Barnardine, in an angry tone, "I will wait no longer." As he &s;aid this, he moved on with the light, and Emily, fearing to provoke him by further delay, re|luctantly followed. From the &s;teps, they proceeded through a pa&s;&s;age, adjoining the vaults, the walls of which were dropping with unwhole&s;ome dews, and the vapours, that crept along the ground, made the torch burn &s;o dimly, that Emily expected every moment to &s;ee it extingui&s;hed, and Barnardine could &s;carcely find his way. As they advanced, the&s;e vapours thick|ened, and Barnardine, believing the torch was expiring, &s;topped for a moment to trim it. As he then re&s;ted again&s;t a pair of iron gates, that opened from the pa&s;&s;age, Emily &s;aw, by uncer|tain fla&s;hes of light, the vaults beyond, and near her, heaps of earth, that &s;eemed to &s;urround an open grave. Such an object, in &s;uch a &s;cene, would, at any time, have di&s;turbed her; but now &s;he was &s;hocked by an in&s;tantaneous pre&s;entiment, that this was the grave of her unfortunate aunt, and that the treacherous Barnardine was leading her&s;elf to de&s;truction. The ob&s;cure and terrible place, to which he had conducted her, &s;eemed to ju&s;tify the thought; it was a place &s;uited for murder, a receptacle for
<PB N="128" REF="029378_0178_0FE0833A5C27AC10">
the dead, where a deed of horror might be committed, and no ve&s;tige appear to proclaim it. Emily was &s;o overwhelmed with terror, that, for a moment, &s;he was unable to determine what conduct to pur&s;ue. She then con&s;idered, that it would be vain to attempt an e&s;cape from Barnardine, by flight, &s;ince the length and the intricacy of the way &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed would &s;oon enable him to overtake her, who was unacquainted with the turn|ings, and who&s;e feeblene&s;s would not &s;uffer her to run long with &s;wiftne&s;s. She feared equally to irritate him by a di&s;clo&s;ure of her &s;u&s;picions, which a refu&s;al to accompany him further cer|tainly would do; and, &s;ince &s;he was already as much in his power as it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he could be, if &s;he proceeded, &s;he, at length, determined to &s;uppre&s;s, as far as &s;he could, the appear|ance of apprehen&s;ion, and to follow &s;ilently whither he de&s;igned to lead her. Pale with horror and anxiety, &s;he now waited till Barnardine had trimmed the torch, and, as her &s;ight glanced again upon the grave, &s;he could not forbear inquiring, for whom it was prepared. He took his eyes from the torch, and fixed them upon her face without &s;peaking. She faintly repeated the que&s;tion, but the man, &s;haking the torch, pa&s;&s;ed on; and &s;he fol|lowed, trembling to a &s;econd flight of &s;teps, having a&s;cended which, a door delivered them into the fir&s;t court of the ca&s;tle. As they cro&s;&s;ed it, the light &s;hewed the high black walls around them, fringed with long gra&s;s and dank weeds, that found a &s;canty &s;oil among the mouldering &s;tones; the heavy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with, here and there, between them, a narrow gate, that admit|ted a freer circulation of air to the court, the ma&s;&s;y iron gates, that led to the ca&s;tle, who&s;e clu&s;tering turrets appeared above, and, oppo&s;ite, the huge towers and arch of the portal it&s;elf. In this &s;cene the large, uncouth per&s;on of Barnardine, bearing the torch, formed a characteri&s;tic figure. This Barnardine was wrapt in a long dark cloak, which &s;carcely allowed the kind of half-boots, or &s;andals, that were laced upon his legs to appear, and &s;hewed only the point of a broad &s;word, which he u&s;ually wore &s;lung in a belt acro&s;s his &s;houlders. On his head was a heavy flat velvet cap, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a turban, in which was a &s;hort feather; the vi&s;age beneath it &s;hewed &s;trong features, and a countenance furrowed with the lines of cunning and darkened by habitual di&s;content.</P>
<P>The view of the court. however, reanimated Emily, who, as &s;he cro&s;&s;ed &s;ilently towards the portal, began to hope, that her own fears and not the treachery of Barnardine, had deceived her. She looked anxiou&s;ly up at the fir&s;t ca&s;ement, that appeared above
<PB N="129" REF="029378_0178_0FE0833A5C27AC10">
the lofty arch of the portcullis; but it was dark, and &s;he inquir|ed whether it belonged to the chamber, where Madame Montoni was confined. Emily &s;poke low, and Barnardine, perhaps, did not hear her que&s;tion, for he returned no an&s;wer; and they, &s;oon after, entered the po&s;tern door of the gateway, which brought them to the foot of a narrow &s;tairca&s;e, that wound up one of the towers.</P>
<P>"Up this &s;tairca&s;e the Signora lies," &s;aid Barnardine.</P>
<P>"Lies!" repeated Emily faintly, as &s;he began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>"She lies in the upper chamber," &s;aid Barnardine.</P>
<P>As they pa&s;&s;ed up, the wind, which poured through the narrow cavities in the wall, made the torch flare, and it threw a &s;tronger gleam upon the grim and &s;allow countenance of Barnardine, and di&s;covered more fully the de&s;olation of the place&mdash;the rough &s;tone walls, the &s;piral &s;tairs, black with age, and a &s;uit of ancient armour, with an iron vi&s;or, that hung upon the walls, and ap|peared a trophy of &s;ome former victory.</P>
<P>Having reached a landing place, "You may wait here, lady," &s;aid he, applying a key to the door of a chamber, "while I go up, and tell the Signora you are coming."</P>
<P>"That ceremony is unnece&s;&s;ary," replied Emily, "my aunt will rejoice to &s;ee me."</P>
<P>"I am not &s;o &s;ure of that," &s;aid Barnardine, pointing to the room he had opened: "Come in here, lady, while I &s;tep up."</P>
<P>Emily, &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;omewhat &s;hocked, did not dare to op|po&s;e him further, but, as he was turning away with the torch, de&s;ired he would not leave her in darkne&s;s. He looked around, and ob&s;erving a tripod lamp, that &s;tood on the &s;tairs, lighted and gave it to Emily, who &s;tepped forward into a large old chamber, and he clo&s;ed the door. As &s;he li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly to his de|parting &s;teps, &s;he thought he de&s;cended, in&s;tead of a&s;cending, the &s;tairs; but the gu&s;ts of wind that whi&s;tled round the portal, would not allow her to hear di&s;tinctly any other &s;ound. Still, however, &s;he li&s;tened, and, perceiving no &s;tep in the room above, where he had affirmed Madame Montoni to be, her anxiety in|crea&s;ed, though &s;he con&s;idered, that the thickne&s;s of the floor in this &s;trong building might prevent any &s;ound reaching her from the upper chamber. The next moment, in a pau&s;e of the wind, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed Barnardine's &s;tep de&s;cending to the court, and then thought &s;he heard his voice; but, the ri&s;ing gu&s;t again overcoming other &s;ounds, Emily, to be certain on this point, moved &s;oftly to the door, which, on attempting to open it, &s;he di&s;covered was fa&s;tened. All the horrid apprehen&s;ions, that had
<PB N="130" REF="029378_0179_0FE0834717EAECC0">
lately a&s;&s;ailed her, returned at this in&s;tant with redoubled force, and no longer appeared like the exaggerations of a timid &s;pirit, but &s;eemed to have been &s;ent to warn her of her fate. She now did not doubt, that Madame Montoni had been murdered, per|haps in this very chamber; or that &s;he her&s;elf was brought hither for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The countenance, the manners and the recollected words of Barnardine, when he had &s;poken of her aunt, confirmed her wor&s;t fears. For &s;ome moments, &s;he was incapa|ble of con&s;idering of any means, by which &s;he might attempt an e&s;cape. Still &s;he li&s;tened, but heard foot&s;teps neither on the &s;tairs, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the room above; &s;he thought, however, that &s;he again di&s;|tingui&s;hed Barnardine's voice below, and went to a grated win|dow, that opened upon the court, to inquire further. Here, &s;he plainly heard his hoar&s;e accents, mingling with the bla&s;t that &s;wept by, but they were lo&s;t again &s;o quickly, that their mean|ing could not be interpreted; and then the light of a torch, which &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the portal below, fla&s;hed acro&s;s the court, and the long &s;hadow of a man, who was under the archway, appeared upon the pavement. Emily, from the hugene&s;s of this &s;udden portrait, concluded it to be that of Barnardine; but other deep tones, which pa&s;&s;ed in the wind, &s;oon convinced her that he was not alone, and that his companion was not a per&s;on very lia|ble to pity.</P>
<P>When her &s;pirits had overcome the fir&s;t &s;hock of her &s;ituation, &s;he held up the lamp to examine, if the chamber afforded a po&s;|&s;ibility of an e&s;cape. It was a &s;pacious room, who&s;e walls, wain|&s;coted with rough oak, &s;hewed no ca&s;ement but the grated one, which Emily had left, and no other door than that, by which &s;he had entered. The feeble rays of the lamp, however, did not al|low her to &s;ee at once its full extent; &s;he perceived no furniture, except, indeed, an iron chair, fa&s;tened in the centre of the cham|ber, immediately over which, depending on a chain from the ciel|ing, hung an iron ring. Having gazed upon the&s;e, for &s;ome|time, with wonder and horror, &s;he next ob&s;erved iron bars below, made for the purpo&s;e of confining the feet, and on the arms of the chair were rings of the &s;ame metal. As &s;he continued to &s;urvey them, &s;he concluded, that they were in&s;truments of tor|ture, and it &s;truck her, that &s;ome poor wretch had once been fa&s;|tened in this chair, and had there been &s;tarved to death. She was chilled by the thought; but, what was her agony, when, in the next moment, it occurred to her, that her aunt might have been one of the&s;e victims, and that &s;he her&s;elf might be the next! An acute pain &s;eized her head, &s;he was &s;carcely able to hold the
<PB N="131" REF="029378_0179_0FE0834717EAECC0">
lamp, and, looking round for &s;upport, was &s;eating her&s;elf, uncon|&s;ciou&s;ly, in the iron chair it&s;elf; but &s;uddenly perceiving where &s;he was, &s;he &s;tarted from it in horror, and &s;prung towards a re|mote end of the room. Here again &s;he looked round for a &s;eat to &s;u&s;tain her, and perceived only a dark curtain, which, de&s;cend|ing from the cieling to the floor, was drawn along the whole &s;ide of the chamber. Ill as &s;he was, the appearance of this curtain &s;truck her, and &s;he pau&s;ed to gaze upon it, in wonder and appre|hen&s;ion.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed to conceal a rece&s;s of the chamber; &s;he wi&s;hed, yet dreaded, to lift it, and to di&s;cover what it veiled, twice &s;he was withheld by a recollection of the terrible &s;pectacle her daring hand had formerly unveiled in an apartment of the ca&s;tle, till, &s;uddenly conjecturing, that it concealed the body of her murder|ed aunt, &s;he &s;eized it, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it of de&s;peration, and drew it a&s;ide. Beyond, appeared a corp&s;e, &s;tretched on a kind of low couch, which was crim&s;oned with human blood, as was the floor beneath.</P>
<P>The features deformed by death, were gha&s;tly and horrible, and more than one livid wound appeared in the face. Emily, bending over the body, gazed, for a moment, with an eager, fren|zied eye; but, in the next, the lamp dropped from her hand, and &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the foot of the couch.</P>
<P>When her &s;en&s;es returned, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;urrounded by men, among whom was Barnardine, who were lifting her from the floor, and then bore her along the chamber. She was &s;en&s;i|ble of what pa&s;&s;ed, but the extreme languor of her &s;pirits did not permit her to &s;peak, or move, or even to feel any di&s;tinct fear. They carried her down the &s;tairca&s;e, by which &s;he had a&s;cended; when, having reached the archway, they &s;topped, and one of the men, taking the torch from Barnardine, opened a &s;mall door, that was cut in the great gate, and, as he &s;tepped out upon the road, the light he bore &s;hewed &s;everal men on hor&s;eback, in wait|ing. Whether it was the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, that revived Emi|ly, or that the objects &s;he now &s;aw rou&s;ed the &s;pirit of alarm, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;poke, and made an ineffectual effort to di&s;engage her|&s;elf from the gra&s;p of the ruffians, who held her.</P>
<P>Barnardine, meanwhile, called loudly for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> torch, while di&s;|tant voices an&s;wered, and &s;everal per&s;ons approached, and, in the &s;ame in&s;tant, a light fla&s;hed upon the court of the ca&s;tle. Again he vociferated for the torch, and the men burried Emily through the gate. At a &s;hort di&s;tance, under the &s;helter of the ca&s;tle walls, &s;he perceived the fellow, who had taken the light from the por|ter, holding it to a man, bu&s;ily employed in altering the &s;addle
<PB N="132" REF="029378_0180_0FE0834BEF94E498">
of a hor&s;e, round which were &s;everal hor&s;emen, looking on, who&s;e har&s;h features received the full glare of the torch; while the broken ground beneath them, the oppo&s;ite walls, with the tufted &s;hrubs, that overhung their &s;ummits, and an embattled watch tower above, were reddened with the gleam, which, fading grad|ually away, left the remoter ramparts, and the woods below to the ob&s;curity of night.</P>
<P>"What do you wa&s;te time for, there?" &s;aid Barnardine with an oath, as he approached the hor&s;emen. "Di&s;patch&mdash;di&s;patch."</P>
<P>"The &s;addle will be ready in a minute," replied the man who was buckling it, at whom Barnardine now &s;wore again, for his negligence, and Emily calling feebly for help, was hurried towards the hor&s;es, while the ruffians di&s;puted on which to place her, the one de&s;igned for her not being ready. At this moment a clu&s;ter of lights i&s;&s;ued from the great gates, and &s;he immedi|ately heard the &s;hrill voice of Annette above tho&s;e of &s;everal other per&s;ons, who advanced. In the &s;ame moment, &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Montoni and Cavigni, followed by a number of ruffian&punc; faced fellows, to whom &s;he no longer looked with terror, but with hope, for, at this in&s;tant, &s;he did not tremble at the thought of any dangers, that might await her within the ca&s;tle&mdash;whence &s;o lately, and &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;he had wi&s;hed to e&s;cape. Tho&s;e, which threatened her from without, had engro&s;&s;ed all her apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>A &s;hort conte&s;t en&s;ued between the parties, in which that of Montoni, however, were pre&s;ently victors, and the hor&s;emen, perceiving, that numbers were again&s;t them, and being, perhaps, not very warmly intere&s;ted in the affair they had undertaken, galloped off, while Barnardine had run far enough to be lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s, and Emily was led back into the ca&s;tle. As &s;he re|pa&s;&s;ed the courts, the remembrance of what &s;he had &s;een in the portal chamber came, with all its horror, to her mind; and when, &s;oon after, &s;he heard the gate clo&s;e, that &s;hut her once more within the ca&s;tle walls, &s;he &s;huddered for her&s;elf, and, almo&s;t for|getting the danger &s;he had e&s;caped, could &s;carcely think, that any thing le&s;s precious than liberty and peace was to be found beyond them.</P>
<P>Montoni ordered Emily to await him in the cedar parlour, whither he &s;oon followed, and then &s;ternly que&s;tioned her on this my&s;terious affair. Though &s;he now viewed him with horror, as the murderer of her aunt, and &s;carcely knew what &s;he &s;aid in re|ply to his impatient inquiries, her an&s;wers and her manner con|vinced him, that &s;he had not taken a voluntary part in the late
<PB N="133" REF="029378_0180_0FE0834BEF94E498">
&s;cheme, and he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her upon the appearance of his &s;er|vants whom he had ordered to attend that he might inquire fur|ther into the affair, and di&s;cover tho&s;e, who had been accompli|ces in it.</P>
<P>Emily had been &s;ometime in her apartment, before the tumult of her mind allowed her to remember &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;ed cir|cum&s;tances. Then, again, the dead form, which the curtain in the portal chamber had di&s;clo&s;ed, came to her fancy, and &s;he ut|tered a groan, which terrified Annette the more, as Emily for|bore to &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity, on the &s;ubject of it, for &s;he feared to tru&s;t her with &s;o fatal a &s;ecret, le&s;t her indi&s;cretion &s;hould call down the immediate vengeance of Montoni on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus compelled to bear within her own mind the whole hor|ror of the &s;ecret, that oppre&s;&s;ed it, her rea&s;on &s;eemed to totter under the intolerable weight. She often fixed a wild and vacant look on Annette, and, when &s;he &s;poke, either did not hear her, or an&s;wered from the purpo&s;e. Long fits of ab&s;traction &s;ucceed|ed; Annette &s;poke repeatedly, but her voice &s;eemed not to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;e of the long agitated Emily, who &s;at fixed and &s;ilent, except that, now and then, &s;he heaved a heavy &s;igh, but without tears.</P>
<P>Terrified at her condition, Annette, at length left the room, to inform Montoni of it, who had ju&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants with|out having made any di&s;coveries on the &s;ubject of his inquiry. The wild de&s;cription, which this girl now gave of Emily, indu|ced him to follow her immediately to the chamber.</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of his voice, Emily turned her eyes, and a gleam of recollection &s;eemed to &s;hoot athwart her mind, for &s;he imme|diately ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and moved &s;lowly to a remote part of the room. He &s;poke to her in accents &s;omewhat &s;oftened from their u&s;ual har&s;hne&s;s, but &s;he regarded him with a kind of half curious, half terrified look, and an&s;wered only "yes," to what|ever he &s;aid. Her mind &s;till &s;eemed to retain no other impre&s;&s;ion than that of fear.</P>
<P>Of this di&s;order Annette could give no explanation, and Mon|toni, having attempted, for &s;ometime, to per&s;uade Emily to talk, retired, after ordering Annette to remain with her, during the night, and to inform him, in the morning of her condition.</P>
<P>When he was gone, Emily again came forward, and a&s;ked who it was, that had been there to di&s;turb her. Annette &s;aid it was the Signor&mdash;Signor Montoni. Emily repeated the name after her, &s;everal times, as if &s;he did not recollect it, and then &s;uddenly groaned, and relap&s;ed into ab&s;traction.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="029378_0181_0FE083556ECDC7F0">
With &s;ome difficulty, Annette led her to the bed, which Em|ily examined with an eager, frenzied eye, before &s;he lay down, and then, pointing, turned with &s;huddering emotion, to Annette, who, now more terrified, went towards the door, that &s;he might bring one of the female &s;ervants to pa&s;s the night with them; but Emily, ob&s;erving her going, called her by name, and then in the naturally &s;oft and plaintive tone of her voice, begged, that &s;he, too, would not for&s;ake her.&mdash;"For, &s;ince my father died," added &s;he, &s;ighing, "every body for&s;akes me."</P>
<P>"Your father, ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid Annette, "he was dead before you knew me."</P>
<P>"He was, indeed!" rejoined Emily, and her tears began to flow. She now wept &s;ilently and long, after which, becoming quite calm, &s;he at length &s;unk to &s;leep, Annette having had di&s;|cretion enough not to interrupt her tears. This, girl as affec|tionate as &s;he was &s;imple, lo&s;t in the&s;e moments all her former fears of remaining in the chamber, and watched alone by Emily, during the whole night.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY's mind was refre&s;hed by &s;leep. On waking in the morning, &s;he looked with &s;urpri&s;e on Annette who &s;at &s;leeping in a chair be&s;ide the bed, and then endeavoured to recollect her|&s;elf; but the circum&s;tances of the preceding night were &s;wept from her memory, which &s;eemed to retain no trace of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;he was &s;till gazing with &s;urpri&s;e on Annette, when the latter awoke.</P>
<P>"O dear ma'am&s;elle! do you know me?" cried &s;he.</P>
<P>"Know you! Certainly," replied Emily, "you are Annette; but why are you &s;itting by me thus?"</P>
<P>"O you have been very ill, ma'am&s;elle, very ill indeed! and I am &s;ure I thought&mdash;"</P>
<P>"This is very &s;trange!" &s;aid Emily, &s;till trying to recollect the pa&s;t.&mdash;"But I think I do remember, that my fancy has been haunted by frightful dreams. Good God!" &s;he added, &s;uddenly &s;tarting&mdash;"&s;urely it was nothing more than a dream!"</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="029378_0181_0FE083556ECDC7F0">
She fixed a terrified look upon Annette, who, intending to quiet her, &s;aid "Yes, ma'am&s;elle, it was more than a dream, but it is all over now."</P>
<P>"She <HI>is</HI> murdered, then!" &s;aid Emily in an inward voice, and &s;huddering in&s;tantaneou&s;ly. Annette &s;creamed; for, being ignorant of the circum&s;tance to which Emily referred, &s;he at|tributed her manner to a di&s;ordered fancy; but, when &s;he had explained to what her own &s;peech alluded, Emily, recollecting the attempt that had been made to carry her off, a&s;ked if the con|triver of it had been di&s;covered. Annette replied, that he had not, though he might ea&s;ily be gue&s;&s;ed at; and then told Emily &s;he might thank her for her deliverance, who, endeavouring to command the emotion, which the remembrance of her aunt had occa&s;ioned, appeared calmly to li&s;ten to Annette, though, in truth, &s;he heard &s;carcely a word that was &s;aid.</P>
<P>"And &s;o, ma'am&s;elle," continued the latter, "I was deter|mined to be even with Barnardine for refu&s;ing to tell me the &s;e|cret, by finding it out my&s;elf; &s;o I watched you, on the terrace, and, as &s;oon as he had opened the door at the end, I &s;tole out from the ca&s;tle, to try to follow you; for, &s;ays I, I am &s;ure no good can be planned, or why all this &s;ecrecy? So, &s;ure enough, he had not bolted the door after him, and, when I opened it, I &s;aw, by the glimmer of the torch, at the other end of the pa&s;&s;age, which way you were going. I followed the light, at a di&s;tance, till you came to the vaults of the chapel, and there I was afraid to go further, for I had heard &s;trange things about the&s;e vaults. But then, again, I was afraid to go back, all in darkne&s;s, by my&s;elf; &s;o by the time Barnardine had trimmed the light, I had re&s;olved to follow you, and I did &s;o, till you came to the great court, and there I was afraid he would &s;ee me; &s;o I &s;topped at the door again, and watched you acro&s;s to the gates, and, when you was gone up the &s;tairs, I whipt after. There, as I &s;tood un|der the gateway, I heard hor&s;es' feet without, and &s;everal men talking; and I heard them &s;wearing at Barnardine for not bring|ing you out, and ju&s;t then, he had like to have caught me, for he came down the &s;tairs again, and I had hardly time to get out of his way. But I had heard enough of his &s;ecret now, and I de|termined to be even with him, and to &s;ave you, too, ma'am&s;elle, for I gue&s;&s;ed it to be &s;ome new &s;cheme of Count Morano, though be was gone away. I ran into the ca&s;tle, but I had hard work to find my way through the pa&s;&s;age under the chapel, and what is very &s;trange, I quite forgot to look for the gho&s;ts they had told me about, though I would not go into that place again by
<PB N="136" REF="029378_0182_0FE0835B06FD4A98">
my&s;elf for all the world! Luckily the Signor and Signor Cavigni were up, &s;o we had &s;oon a train at our heels, &s;ufficient to frighten that Barnardine and his rogues, all together."</P>
<P>Annette cea&s;ed to &s;peak, but Emily &s;till appeared to li&s;ten. At length &s;he &s;aid, &s;uddenly, "I think I will go to him my&s;elf; where is he?"</P>
<P>Annette a&s;ked who was meant.</P>
<P>"Signor Montoni," replied Emily. "I would &s;peak with him;" and Annette, now remembering the order he had given, on the preceding night, re&s;pecting her young lady, ro&s;e, and &s;aid &s;he would &s;eek him her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t girl's &s;u&s;picions of Count Morano were perfectly ju&s;t; Emily, too when &s;he thought on the &s;cheme, had attributed it to him; and Montoni, who had not a doubt on this &s;ubject, al&s;o, began to believe, that it was by the direction of Morano that poi&s;on had formerly been mingled with his wine.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ions of repentance, which Morano had made to Emily, under the angui&s;h of his wound, were &s;incere at the mo|ment he offered them; but he had mi&s;taken the &s;ubject of his &s;orrow, for, while he thought he was condemning the cruelty of his late de&s;ign, he was lamenting only the &s;tate of &s;uffering, to which it had reduced him. As the&s;e &s;ufferings abated, his former views revived, till, his health being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he again found him&s;elf ready for enterpri&s;e and difficulty. The porter of the ca&s;tle, who had &s;erved him on a former occa&s;ion, willingly accepted a &s;econd bribe; and, having concerted the means of drawing Emily to the gates, Morano publicly left the hamlet, whither he had been carried after the affray, and with|drew with his people to another at &s;everal miles di&s;tance. From thence, on a night agreed upon by Barnardine, who had di&s;cov|ered from the thoughtle&s;s prattle of Annette, the mo&s;t probable means of decoying Emily, the Count &s;ent back his &s;ervants to the ca&s;tle, while he awaited her arrival at the hamlet, with an in|tention of carrying her immediately to Venice. How this, his &s;econd &s;cheme, was fru&s;trated, has already appeared; but the violent, and various pa&s;&s;ions with which this Italian lover was now agitated, on his return to that city, can only be imagined.</P>
<P>Annette having made her report to Montoni, of Emily's health and of her reque&s;t to &s;ee him, he replied, that &s;he might attend him in the cedar room, in about an hour. It was on the &s;ubject, that pre&s;&s;ed &s;o heavily on her mind, that Emily wi&s;hed to &s;peak to him, yet &s;he did not di&s;tinctly know what good purpo&s;e this could an&s;wer and &s;ometimes &s;he even recoiled in horror from
<PB N="137" REF="029378_0182_0FE0835B06FD4A98">
the expectation of his pre&s;ence. She wi&s;hed, al&s;o, to petition, though &s;he &s;carcely dared to believe the reque&s;t would be granted, that he would permit her, &s;ince her aunt was no more, to return to her native country.</P>
<P>As the moment of interview approached, her agitation in|crea&s;ed &s;o much, that &s;he almo&s;t re&s;olved to excu&s;e her&s;elf under what could &s;carcely be called a pretence of illne&s;s and, when &s;he con&s;idered what could be &s;aid, either concerning her&s;elf, or the fate of her aunt, &s;he was equally hopele&s;s as to the event of her entreaty, and terrified as to its effect upon the vengeful &s;pirit of Montoni. Yet, to pretend ignorance of her death, appeared in &s;ome degree, to be &s;haring its criminality, and, indeed, this event was the only ground, on which Emily could re&s;t her pe|tition for leaving Udolpho.</P>
<P>While her thoughts thus wavered, a me&s;&s;age was brought, im|porting, that Montoni could not &s;ee her, till the next day; and her &s;pirits were then relieved, for a moment, from an almo&s;t in|tolerable weight of apprehen&s;ion. Annette &s;aid, &s;he fancied the Chevaliers were going out to the wars again, for the court|yard was filled with hor&s;es, and &s;he heard, that the re&s;t of the party, who went out before, were expected at the ca&s;tle. "And I heard one of the &s;oldiers, too," added &s;he, "&s;ay to his com|rade, that he would warrant they'd bring home a rare deal of booty.&mdash;So, thinks I, if the Signor can, with a &s;afe con&s;cience, &s;end his people out a robbing&mdash;why it is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine. I only wi&s;h I was once &s;afe out of this ca&s;tle; and, if it had not been for poor Ludovico's &s;ake, I would have let Count Morano's people run away with us both, for it would have been &s;erving you a good turn, ma'am&s;elle, as well as my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Annette might have continued thus talking for hours for any interruption &s;he would have received from Emily, who was &s;ilent, inattentive, ab&s;orbed in thought, and pa&s;&s;ed the whole of this day in a kind of &s;olemn tranquillity, &s;uch as is often the re&s;ult of fac|ulties over&s;trained by &s;uffering.</P>
<P>When night returned, Emily recollected the my&s;terious &s;trains of mu&s;ic, that &s;he had lately heard in which &s;he &s;till felt &s;ome de|gree of intere&s;t, and of which &s;he hoped to hear again the &s;ooth|ing &s;weetne&s;s. The influence of &s;uper&s;tition now gained on the weakne&s;s of her long hara&s;&s;ed mind; &s;he looked, with enthu|&s;ia&s;tic expectation, to the guardian &s;pirit of her father, and, hav|ing di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Annette for the night, determined to watch alone for their return. It was not yet, however, near the time when &s;he had heard the mu&s;ic on a former night, and anxious to call off
<PB N="138" REF="029378_0183_0FE083672683E0E8">
her thoughts from di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ubjects, &s;he &s;at down with one of the few books, that &s;he had brought from France; but her mind, refu&s;ing control, became re&s;tle&s;s and agitated, and &s;he went of|ten to the ca&s;ement to li&s;ten for a &s;ound. Once, &s;he thought &s;he heard a voice, but then, every thing without the ca&s;ement remaining &s;till, &s;he concluded, that her fancy had deceived her.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time, till twelve o'clock, &s;oon after which the di&s;tant &s;ounds that murmured through the ca&s;tle, cea&s;ed, and &s;leep &s;eemed to reign over all. Emily then &s;eated her&s;elf at the ca&s;ement, where &s;he was &s;oon recalled from the reverie, into which &s;he &s;unk, by very unu&s;ual &s;ounds, not of mu&s;ic, but like the low mourning of &s;ome per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s. As &s;he li&s;tened, her heart faltered in terror, and &s;he became convinced, that the for|mer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound was more than imaginary. Still, at intervals, &s;he heard a kind of feeble lamentation, and &s;ought to di&s;cover whence it came. There were &s;everal rooms underneath, adjoin|ing the rampart, which had been long &s;hut up, and, as the &s;ound probably ro&s;e from one of the&s;e, &s;he leaned from the ca&s;ement to ob&s;erve, whether any light was vi&s;ible there. The chambers, as far as &s;he could perceive, were quite dark, but, at a little di&s;|tance, on the rampart below, &s;he thot' &s;he &s;aw &s;omething moving.</P>
<P>The faint twilight, which the &s;tars &s;hed, did not enable her to di&s;tingui&s;h what it was; but &s;he judged it to be a &s;entinel, on watch, and &s;he removed her light to a remote part of the cham|ber, that &s;he might e&s;cape notice, during her further ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The &s;ame object &s;till appeared. Pre&s;ently, it advanced along the rampart, towards her window, and &s;he then di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;omething like a human form, but the &s;ilence, with which it mov|ed, convinced her it was no &s;entinel. As it drew near, &s;he he&s;i|tated whether to retire; a thrilling curio&s;ity inclined her to &s;tay, but a dread of &s;he &s;carcely knew what warned her to withdraw.</P>
<P>While &s;he pau&s;ed, the figure came oppo&s;ite to her ca&s;ement, and was &s;tationary. Every thing remained quiet; &s;he had not heard even a footfall; and the &s;olemnity of this &s;ilence, with the my&s;terious form &s;he &s;aw, &s;ubdued her &s;pirits, &s;o that &s;he was mov|ving from the ca&s;ement, when on a &s;udden, &s;he ob&s;erved the figure &s;tart away, and glide down the rampart, after which it was &s;oon lo&s;t in the ob&s;curity of night. Emily continued to gaze, for &s;ometime, on the way it had pa&s;&s;ed, and then retired within her chamber, mu&s;ing on this &s;trange circum&s;tance, and &s;carcely doubting that &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed a &s;upernatural appearance.</P>
<P>When her &s;pirits recovered compo&s;ure, &s;he looked round for &s;ome other explanation. Remembering what &s;he had heard of the daring enterpri&s;es of Montoni, it occurred to her, that &s;he
<PB N="139" REF="029378_0183_0FE083672683E0E8">
had ju&s;t &s;een &s;ome unhappy per&s;on, who, having been plundered by his banditti, was brought hither a captive; and that the mu|&s;ic &s;he had formerly heard, came from him. Yet, if they had plundered him, it &s;till appeared improbable, that they &s;hould have brought him to the ca&s;tle, and it was al&s;o more con&s;i&s;tent with the manners of banditti to murder tho&s;e they rob, than to make them pri&s;oners. But what, more than any other circum|&s;tance, contradicted the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it was a pri&s;oner, was that it wandered on the terrace, without a guard: a con&s;ideration, which made her di&s;mi&s;s immediately her fir&s;t &s;urmi&s;e.</P>
<P>Afterwards, &s;he was inclined to believe, that Count Morano had obtained admittance into the ca&s;tle; but &s;he &s;oon recollected the difficulties and dangers, that mu&s;t have oppo&s;ed &s;uch an en|terpri&s;e, and that, if he had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, to come alone and in &s;ilence to her ca&s;ement at midnight was not the conduct he would have adopted, particularly &s;ince the private &s;tairca&s;e, com|municating with her apartment, was known to him; neither would he have uttered the di&s;mal &s;ounds &s;he had heard.</P>
<P>Another &s;ugge&s;tion repre&s;ented, that this might be &s;ome per|&s;on who had de&s;igns upon the ca&s;tle; but the mournful &s;ounds de&s;troyed, al&s;o that probability. Thus, inquiry only perplexed her. Who, or what, it could be that haunted this lonely hour, complaining in &s;uch doleful accents and in &s;uch &s;weet mu&s;ic (for &s;he was &s;till inclined to believe, that the former &s;trains and the late appearance were connected) &s;he had no means of a&s;certaining; and imagination again a&s;&s;umed her empire, and rou&s;ed the my&s;|teries of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>She determined, however, to watch on the following night, when her doubts might, perhaps, be cleared up; and &s;he almo&s;t re&s;olved to addre&s;s the figure, if it &s;hould appear again.</P>

checked the intention, and this day pa&s;&s;ed, as the preceding one, with Emily, except that a degree of awful expectation, concern|ing the approaching night, now &s;omewhat di&s;turbed the dreadful calmne&s;s that had pervaded her mind.</P>
<P>Towards evening, the &s;econd part of the band, which had made the fir&s;t excur&s;ion among the mountains, returned to the ca&s;tle, where, as they entered the courts, Emily, in her remote chamber, heard their loud &s;houts and &s;trains of exultation, like the orgies of furies over &s;ome horrid &s;acrifice. She even feared they were about to commit &s;ome barbarous deed; a conjecture from which, however, Annette &s;oon relieved her, by telling, that the people were only exulting over the plunder they had brought with them. This circum&s;tance &s;till further confirmed her in the belief, that Montoni had really commenced to be a captain of banditti, and meant to retrieve his broken fortunes by the plun|der of travellers! Indeed, when &s;he con&s;idered all the circum|&s;tances of his &s;ituation&mdash;in an armed, and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible ca&s;|tle, retired far among the rece&s;&s;es of wild and &s;olitary mountains, along who&s;e di&s;tant &s;kirts were &s;cattered towns, and cities, whither wealthy travellers were continually pa&s;&s;ing&mdash;this appeared to be the &s;ituation of all others mo&s;t &s;uited for the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;chemes of rapine, and &s;he yielded to the &s;trange thought, that Montoni was become a captain of robbers. His character al&s;o, unprinci|pled, dauntle&s;s, cruel and enterpri&s;ing, &s;eemed to fit him for the &s;ituation. Delighting in the tumult and in the &s;truggles of life, he was equally a &s;tranger to pity and to fear; his very courage was a &s;ort of animal ferocity; not the noble impul&s;e of a prin|ciple, &s;uch as in&s;pirits the mind again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;or, in the cau&s;e of the oppre&s;&s;ed; but a con&s;titutional hardine&s;s of nerve, that cannot feel, and that, therefore, cannot fear.</P>
<P>Emily's &s;uppo&s;ition, however natural, was in part erroneous, for &s;he was a &s;tranger to the &s;tate of this country and to the cir|cum&s;tances, under which its frequent wars were partly conducted. The revenues of the many &s;tates of Italy being, at that time, in|&s;ufficient to the &s;upport of &s;tanding armies, even during the &s;hort periods, which the turbulent habits both of the governments and the people permitted to pa&s;s in peace, an order of men aro&s;e not known in our age, and but faintly de&s;cribed in the hi&s;tory of their own. Of the &s;oldiers, di&s;banded at the end of every war, few returned to the &s;afe, but unprofitable occupations, then u&s;ual in peace. Sometimes they pa&s;&s;ed into other countries, and min|gled with armies, which &s;till kept the field. Sometimes they formed them&s;elves into bands of robbers, and occupied remote
<PB N="141" REF="029378_0184_0FE0836BC4C2D388">
fortre&s;&s;es, where their de&s;perate character, the weakne&s;s of the governments which they offended, and the certainty that they could be recalled to the armies, when their pre&s;ence &s;hould be again wanted, prevented them from being much pur&s;ued by the civil power; and, &s;ometimes, they attached them&s;elves to the fortunes of a popular chief, by whom they were led into the &s;er|vice of any &s;tate, which could &s;ettle with him the price of their valour. From this latter practice aro&s;e their name&mdash;<HI>Condottieri;</HI> a term formidable all over Italy, for a period, which concluded in the earlier part of the &s;eventeenth century, but of which it is not &s;o ea&s;y to a&s;certain the commencement.</P>
<P>Conte&s;ts between the &s;maller &s;tates were then, for the mo&s;t part, affairs of enterpri&s;e alone, and the probabilities of &s;ucce&s;s were e&s;timated, not from the &s;kill, but from the per&s;onal courage of the general, and the &s;oldiers. The ability, which was nece&s;|&s;ary to the conduct of tedious operations, was little valued. It was enough to know how a party might be led towards their enemies, with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy, or conducted from them in the compacte&s;t order. The officer was to precipitate him&s;elf in|to a &s;ituation, where, but for his example, the &s;oldiers might not have ventured; and, as the oppo&s;ite parties knew little of each other's &s;trength, the event of the day was frequently determined by the boldne&s;s of the fir&s;t movements. In &s;uch &s;ervices the <HI>Con|dottieri</HI> were eminent, and in the&s;e, where plunder always follow|ed &s;ucce&s;s, their characters acquired a mixture of intrepidity and profligacy, which awed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ven tho&s;e whom they &s;erved.</P>
<P>When they were not thus engaged, their chief had u&s;ually his own fortre&s;s, in which, or in its neighbourhood, they enjoyed an irk&s;ome re&s;t; and, though their wants were, at one time, partly &s;upplied from the property of the inhabitants, the lavi&s;h di&s;tribu|tion of their plunder at others, prevented them from being ob|noxious; and the pea&s;ants of &s;uch di&s;tricts gradually &s;hared the character of their warlike vi&s;itors. The neighbouring govern|ments &s;ometimes profe&s;&s;ed, but &s;eldom endeavoured, to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e military communities; both becau&s;e it was difficult to do &s;o, and becau&s;e a di&s;gui&s;ed protection of them en&s;ured, for the &s;ervice of their wars, a body of men, who could not otherwi&s;e be &s;o cheaply maintained, or &s;o perfectly qualified. The comman|ders &s;ometimes even relied &s;o far upon this policy of the &s;everal powers, as to frequent their capitals; and Montoni, having met them in the gaming parties of Venice and Padua, conceived a de&s;ire to emulate their characters, before his ruined fortunes tempted him to adopt their practices. It was for the arrange|ment
<PB N="142" REF="029378_0185_0FE08379589AB4C0">
of his pre&s;ent plan of life, that the midnight councils were held at his man&s;ion in Venice, and at which Or&s;ino and &s;ome other members of the pre&s;ent community then a&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;ug|ge&s;tions, which they had &s;ince executed with the wreck of their fortunes.</P>
<P>On the return of night, Emily re&s;umed her &s;tation at the ca&s;e|ment. There was now a moon; and, as it ro&s;e over the tufted woods, its yellow light &s;erved to &s;hew the lonely terrace and the &s;urrounding objects, more di&s;tinctly, than the twilight of the &s;tars had done, and promi&s;ed Emily to a&s;&s;i&s;t her ob&s;ervations, &s;hould the my&s;terious form return. On this &s;ubject, &s;he again wavered in conjecture, and he&s;itated whether to &s;peak to the figure, to which a &s;trong and almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible intere&s;t urged her; but terror, at intervals, made her reluctant to do &s;o.</P>
<P>"If this is a per&s;on who has de&s;igns upon the ca&s;tle," &s;aid &s;he, "my curio&s;ity may prove fatal to me; yet the my&s;terious mu&s;ic, and the lamentations I heard, mu&s;t &s;urely have proceeded from him: if &s;o, he cannot be an enemy."</P>
<P>She then thought of her unfortunate aunt, and, &s;huddering with grief and horror, the &s;ugge&s;tions of imagination &s;eized her mind with all the force of truth, and &s;he believed, that the form &s;he had &s;een was &s;upernatural. She trembled, breathed with diffi|culty, an icy coldne&s;s touched her cheeks, and her fears for a while overcame her judgment. Her re&s;olution now for&s;ook her, and the determined, if the figure &s;hould appear, not to &s;peak to it.</P>
<P>Thus the time pa&s;&s;ed, as &s;he &s;at at her ca&s;ement, awed by ex|pectation, and by the gloom and &s;tillne&s;s of midnight; for &s;he &s;aw ob&s;curely in the moonlight only the mountains and woods, a clu&s;ter of towers, that formed the we&s;t angle of the ca&s;tle, and the terrace below; and heard no &s;ound, except now and then, the lonely watchword, pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;entinels on duty, and after|wards the &s;teps of the men who came to relieve guard, and whom &s;he knew at a di&s;tance on the rampart by their pikes, that glit|tered in the moonbeam, and then, by the few &s;hort words, in which they hailed their fellows of the night. Emily retired within her chamber, while they pa&s;&s;ed the ca&s;ement. When &s;he returned to it, all was again quiet. It was now very late, &s;he was wearied with watching, and began to doubt the reality of what &s;he had &s;een on the preceding night; but &s;he &s;till lin|gered at the window, for her mind was too perturbed to admit of &s;leep. The moon &s;hone with a clear lu&s;tre, that afforded her a complete view of the terrace; but &s;he &s;aw only a &s;olitary &s;en|tinel, pacing at one end of it; and, at length, tired with expec|tation, &s;he withdr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w to &s;eek re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="029378_0185_0FE08379589AB4C0">
Such, however, was the impre&s;&s;ion, left on her mind by the mu&s;ic, and the complaining &s;he had formerly heard, as well as by the figure, which &s;he fancied &s;he had &s;een, that &s;he deter|mined to repeat the watch, on the following night.</P>
<P>Montoni, on the next day, took no notice of Emily's ap|pointed vi&s;it, but &s;he, more anxious than before to &s;ee him, &s;ent Annette to inquire, at what hour he would admit her. He mentioned eleven o'clock, and Emily was punctual to the mo|ment; at which &s;he called up all her fortitude to &s;upport the &s;hock of his pre&s;ence and the dreadful recollections it enforced. He was with &s;everal of his officers, in the cedar room; on ob|&s;erving whom &s;he pau&s;ed; and her agitation increa&s;ed, while he continued to conver&s;e with them, apparently not ob&s;erving her, till &s;ome of his officers, turning round, &s;aw Emily, and uttered an exclamation. She was ha&s;tily retiring, when Montoni's voice arre&s;ted her, and, in a faltering accent, &s;he &s;aid,&mdash;"I would &s;peak with you, Signor Montoni, if you are at lei&s;ure."</P>
<P>"The&s;e are my friends," he replied, "whatever you would &s;ay, they may hear."</P>
<P>Emily, without replying, turned from the rude gaze of the chevaliers, and Montoni then followed her to the hall, whence he led her to a &s;mall room, of which he &s;hut the door with violence. As &s;he looked on his dark countenance, &s;he again thought &s;he &s;aw the murderer of her aunt; and her mind was &s;o convul&s;ed which horror, that &s;he had not power to recal thought enough to explain the purport of her vi&s;it; and to tru&s;t her&s;elf with the mention of Madame Montoni was more than &s;he dared.</P>
<P>Montoni at length impatiently inquired what &s;he had to &s;ay? "I have no time for trifling," he added, "my moments are im|portant."</P>
<P>Emily then told him, that &s;he wi&s;hed to return to France, and came to beg that he would permit her to do &s;o.&mdash;But when he looked &s;urpri&s;ed, and inquired for the motive of the reque&s;t, &s;he he&s;itated, became paler than before, trembled, and had nearly &s;unk at his feet. He ob&s;erved her emotion, with apparent indiffer|ence, and interrupted the &s;ilence by telling her, he mu&s;t be gone. Emily, however, recalled her &s;pirits &s;ufficiently to enable her to repeat her reque&s;t. And, when Montoni ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed it, her &s;lumbering mind was rou&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I can no longer remain here with propriety, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "and I may be allowed to a&s;k, by what right you detain me."</P>
<P>"It is my will that you remain here," &s;aid Montoni, laying his hand on the door to go; "let that &s;uffice you."</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="029378_0186_0FE0837DEF67D570">
Emily, con&s;idering that &s;he had no appeal from this will, for|bore to di&s;pute his right, and made a feeble effort to per|&s;uade him to be ju&s;t. "While my aunt lived, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, in a tremulous voice, "my re&s;idence here was not improper; but now, that &s;he is no more, I may &s;urely be permitted to depart. My &s;tay cannot benefit you, &s;ir, and will only di&s;tre&s;s me."</P>
<P>"Who told you, that Madame Montoni was dead?" &s;aid Montoni, with an inqui&s;itive eye. Emily he&s;itated, for nobody told her &s;o, and &s;he did not dare to avow the having &s;een that &s;pectacle in the portal chamber, which had compelled her to the belief.</P>
<P>"Who told you &s;o?" he repeated, more &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"Alas! I know it too well," replied Emily: "&s;pare me on this terrible &s;ubject!"</P>
<P>She &s;at down on a bench to &s;upport her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"If you wi&s;h to &s;ee her," &s;aid Montoni, "you may; &s;he lies in the ea&s;t turret."</P>
<P>He now left the room, without awaiting her reply, and re|turned to the cedar chamber, where &s;uch of the chevaliers as had not before &s;een Emily, began to rally him, on the di&s;covery they had made; but Montoni did not appear di&s;po&s;ed to bear this mirth, and they changed the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Having talked with the &s;ubtle Or&s;ino, on the plan of an ex|cur&s;ion, which he meditated for a future day, his friend advi&s;ed, that they &s;hould lie in wait for the enemy, which Verezzi impet|uou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, reproached Or&s;ino with want of &s;pirit, and &s;wore, that, if Montoni would let him lead on fifty men, he would con|quer all that &s;hould oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>Or&s;ino &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly; Montoni &s;miled too, but he al&s;o li&s;tened. Verezzi then proceeded with vehement declama|tion and a&s;&s;ertion, till he was &s;topped by an argument of Or&s;ino, which he knew not how to an&s;wer better than by invective. His fierce &s;pirit dete&s;ted the cunning caution of Or&s;ino, whom he con|&s;tantly oppo&s;ed, and who&s;e inveterate, though &s;ilent, hatred he had long ago incurred. And Montoni was a calm ob&s;erver of both, who&s;e different qualifications, he knew, and how to bend their op|po&s;ite character to the perfection of his own de&s;igns. But Ve|rezzi in the heat of oppo&s;ition, now did not &s;cruple to accu&s;e Or|&s;ino of cowardice, at which the countenance of the latter, while he made no reply, was over&s;pread with a livid palene&s;s; and Mon|toni, who watched his lurking eye, &s;aw him put his hand ha&s;tily into his bo&s;om. But Verezzi, who&s;e face glowing with crim|&s;on, formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the complexion of Or&s;ino, re|marked
<PB N="145" REF="029378_0186_0FE0837DEF67D570">
not the action, and continued boldly declaiming again&s;t cowards to Cavigni, who was &s;lily laughing at his vehemence, and at the &s;ilent mortification of Or&s;ino, when the latter, retir|ing a few &s;teps behind, drew forth a &s;tilletto to &s;tab his adver&s;ary in the back. Montoni arre&s;ted his half extended arm, and, with a &s;ignificant look, made him return the poinard into his bo&s;om, un&s;een by all except him&s;elf; for mo&s;t of the party were di&s;put|ing at a di&s;tant window, on the &s;ituation of a dell where they meant to form an ambu&s;cade.</P>
<P>When Verezzi had turned round, the deadly hatred expre&s;&s;ed on the features of his opponent, rai&s;ing, for the fir&s;t time, a &s;u&s;|picion of his intention, he laid his hand on his &s;word, and then, &s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, &s;trode up to Montoni.</P>
<P>"Signor," &s;aid he, with a &s;ignificant look at Or&s;ino, "we are not a band of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; if you have bu&s;ine&s;s for brave men employ me on this expedition: you &s;hall have the la&s;t drop of my blood; if you have only work for cowards&mdash;keep him," pointing to Or&s;ino, "and let me quit Udolpho."</P>
<P>Or&s;ino, &s;till more incen&s;ed, again drew forth his &s;tilletto, and ru&s;hed towards Verezzi, who, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, advanced with his &s;word, when Montoni and the re&s;t of the party interfered and &s;eparated them.</P>
<P>"This is the conduct of a boy," &s;aid Montoni to Verezzi, "not of a man: be more moderate in your &s;peech."</P>
<P>"Moderation is the virtue of cowards," retorted Verezzi; "they are moderate in every thing&mdash;but in fear."</P>
<P>"I accept your words," &s;aid Montoni, turning upon him with a fierce and haughty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook, and drawing his &s;word out of the &s;cabbard.</P>
<P>"With all my heart," cried Verezzi, "though I did not mean them for you."</P>
<P>He directed a pa&s;s at Montoni; and, while they fought, the villain Or&s;ino, made another attempt to &s;tab Verezzi, and was again prevented.</P>
<P>The combatants were, at length, &s;eparated; and, after a very long and violent di&s;pute, reconciled. Montoni then left the room with Or&s;ino, whom he detained in private con&s;ultation for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile, &s;tunned by the la&s;t words of Montoni, for|got, for the moment, his declaration, that &s;he &s;hould continue in the ca&s;tle, while &s;he thought of her unfortunate aunt, who, he had &s;aid, was laid in the ea&s;t turret. In &s;uffering the remains of his wife to lie thus long unburied, there appeared a degree of bru|tality
<PB N="146" REF="029378_0187_0FE0838782076CA8">
more &s;hocking than &s;he had &s;u&s;pected even Montoni could practi&s;e.</P>
<P>After a long &s;truggle, &s;he determined to accept his permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it the turret, and to take a la&s;t look of her ill-fated aunt: with which de&s;ign &s;he returned to her chamber, and, while &s;he waited for Annette to accompany her, endeavoured to acquire fortitude &s;ufficient to &s;upport her through the approaching &s;cene, for, though &s;he trembled to encounter it, &s;he knew that to re|member the performance of this la&s;t act of duty would hereafter afford her con&s;oling &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Annette came, and Emily mentioned her purpo&s;e, from which the former endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade her, though without effect, and Annette was, with much difficulty, prevailed upon to ac|company her to the turret; but no con&s;ideration could make her promi&s;e to enter the chamber of death.</P>
<P>They now left the corridor, and, having reached the foot of the &s;tairca&s;e, which Emily had formerly a&s;cended, Annette de|clared &s;he would go no further, and Emily proceeded a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re. When &s;he &s;aw the track of blood, which &s;he had before ob&s;erv|ed, her &s;pirits fainted, and, being compelled to re&s;t on the &s;tairs, &s;he almo&s;t determined to proceed no further. The pau&s;e of a few moments re&s;tored her re&s;olution, and &s;he went on.</P>
<P>As &s;he drew near the landing place, upon which the upper chamber opened, &s;he remembered, that the door was formerly fa&s;tened, and apprehended, that it might &s;till be &s;o. In this ex|pectation, however, &s;he was mi&s;taken; for the door opened at once, into a du&s;ky and &s;ilent chamber, round which &s;he fearfully looked, and then &s;lowly advanced, when a hollow voice &s;poke. Emily, who was unable to &s;peak, or to move from the &s;pot, ut|tered no &s;ound of terror. The voice &s;poke again; and, then, thinking that it re&s;embled that of Madame Montoni, Emily's &s;pirits were in&s;tantly rou&s;ed; &s;he ru&s;hed towards a bed, that &s;tood in a remote part of the room, and drew a&s;ide the curtain. Within appeared a pale and emaciated face. She &s;tarted back, then again advanced, &s;huddered as &s;he took up the &s;keleton hand, that lay &s;tretched upon the quilt; then let it drop, and then viewed the face with a long, un&s;ettled gaze. It was that of Madame Montoni, though &s;o changed by illne&s;s, that the re&s;em|blance of what it had been, could &s;carcely be traced in what it now appeared. She was &s;till alive, and, rai&s;ing her heavy eyes, &s;he turned them on her niece.</P>
<P>"Where have you been &s;o long?" &s;aid &s;he, in the &s;ame hol|low tone, "I thought you had for&s;aken me."</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="029378_0187_0FE0838782076CA8">
"Do you indeed live," &s;aid Emily, at length, "or is this but a terrible apparition?" She received no an&s;wer, and again &s;he &s;natched up the hand. "This is &s;ub&s;tance," &s;he exclaimed, "but it is cold&mdash;cold as marble!" She let it fall. "O, if you really live, Speak!" &s;aid Emily, in a voice of de&s;peration, "that I may not lo&s;e my &s;en&s;es&mdash;&s;ay you know me!"</P>
<P>"I do live," replied Madame Montoni, "but&mdash;I feel that I am about to die."</P>
<P>Emily cla&s;ped the hand &s;he held, more eagerly, and groaned. They were both &s;ilent for &s;ome moments. Then Emily endea|voured to &s;ooth her, and inquired what had reduced her to this pre&s;ent deplorable &s;tate.</P>
<P>Montoni, when he removed her to the turret under the im|probable &s;u&s;picion of having attempted his life, had ordered the men employed on the occa&s;ion, to ob&s;erve a &s;trict &s;ecrecy con|cerning her. To this he was influenced by a double motive.&mdash;He meant to debar her from the comfort of Emily's vi&s;its, and to &s;ecure an opportunity of privately di&s;patching her, &s;hould any new circum&s;tances occur to confirm the pre&s;ent &s;ugge&s;tions of his &s;u&s;pecting mind. His con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the hatred he de&s;erved it was natural enough &s;hould at fir&s;t lead him to attribute to her the attempt that had been made upon his life; and, though there was no other rea&s;on to believe that &s;he was concerned in that attrocious de&s;ign, his &s;u&s;picions remained; he continued to con|fine her in the turret, under a &s;trict guard; and, without pity or remor&s;e, had &s;uffered her to lie, forlorn and neglected, under a raging fever, till it had reduced her to the pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>The track of blood, which Emily had &s;een on the &s;tairs, had flowed from the unbound wound of one of the men employed to carry Madame Montoni, and which he had received in the late affray. At night the&s;e men, having contented them&s;elves with &s;ecuring the door of their pri&s;oner's room, had retired from guard; and then it was, that Emily, at the time of her fir&s;t in|quiry, had found the turret &s;o &s;ilent and de&s;erted.</P>
<P>When &s;he had attempted to open the door of the chamber, her aunt was &s;leeping, and this occa&s;ioned the &s;ilence, which had contributed to delude her into a belief, that &s;he was no more; yet had her terror permitted her to per&s;evere longer in the call, &s;he would probably have awakened Madame Montoni, and have been &s;pared much &s;uffering. The &s;pectacle in the portal cham|ber, which afterwards confirmed Emily's horrible &s;u&s;picion, was the corp&s;e of a man, who had fallen in the affray, and the &s;ame which had been borne into the &s;ervants' hall, where &s;he took re|fuge
<PB N="148" REF="029378_0188_0FE0838D573519E0">
from the tumult. This man had lingered under his wounds for &s;ome days; and, &s;oon after his death, his body had been re|moved on the couch, on which he died, for interment in the vault beneath the chapel, through which Emily and Barnardine had pa&s;&s;ed to the chamber.</P>
<P>Emily, after a&s;king Madame Montoni a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning her&s;elf, left her, and &s;ought Montoni; for the more &s;olemn intere&s;t &s;he felt for her aunt, made her now regardle&s;s of the re&s;entment her remon&s;trances might draw upon her&s;elf, and of the improbability of his granting what &s;he meant to entreat.</P>
<P>"Madame Montoni is now dying, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw him&mdash;"Your re&s;entment, &s;urely will not pur&s;ue her to the la&s;t moment; Suffer her to be removed from that forlorn room to her own apartment, and to have nece&s;&s;ary comforts ad|mini&s;tered."</P>
<P>"Of what &s;ervice will that be, if &s;he is dying?" &s;aid Mon|toni with apparent indifference.</P>
<P>"The &s;ervice, at lea&s;t, of &s;aving you, &s;ir, from a few of tho&s;e pangs of con&s;cience you mu&s;t &s;uffer, when you &s;hall be in the &s;ame &s;ituation," &s;aid Emily, with imprudent indignation, of which Montoni &s;oon made her &s;en&s;ible, by commanding her to quit his pre&s;ence. Then forgetting her re&s;entment, and im|pre&s;&s;ed only by compa&s;&s;ion for the piteous &s;tate of her aunt, dy|ing without &s;uccour, &s;he &s;ubmitted to humble her&s;elf to Monto|ni, and to adopt every per&s;ua&s;ive means, that might reduce him to relent towards his wife.</P>
<P>For a con&s;iderable time he was proof again&s;t all &s;he &s;aid, and all &s;he looked; but at length the divinity of pity, beaming in Emily's eyes, &s;eemed to touch his heart. He turned away, a&s;hamed of his better feelings, half &s;ullen and half relen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">; but finally con&s;ented, that his wife &s;hould be removed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> own apartment, and that Emily &s;hould attend her. Dreading equally; that this relief might arrive too late, and that Montoni might retract his conce&s;&s;ion, Emily &s;carcely &s;taid to thank him for it, but, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Annette, &s;he quickly prepared Madame Montoni's bed, and they carried her a cordial, that might ena|ble her feeble frame to &s;u&s;tain the fatigue of a removal.</P>
<P>Madame was &s;carcely arrived in her own appartment, when an order was given by her hu&s;band that &s;he &s;hould remain in the turret; but Emily, thankful that &s;he had made &s;uch di&s;patch, ha&s;tened to inform him of it, as well as that a &s;econd removal would in&s;tantly prove fatal, and he &s;uffered his wife to continue where &s;he was.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="029378_0188_0FE0838D573519E0">
During this day, Emily never left Madame Montoni, except to prepare &s;uch little nouri&s;hing things as &s;he judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain her, and which Madame Montoni received with quiet ac|quie&s;cence, though &s;he &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible that they could not &s;ave her from approaching di&s;&s;olution, and &s;carcely appeared to wi&s;h for life. Emily meanwhile watched over her with the mo&s;t ten|der &s;olicitude, no longer &s;eeing her imperious aunt in the poor object before her, but the &s;i&s;ter of her late beloved father, in a &s;ituation that called for all her compa&s;&s;ion and kindne&s;s. When night came, &s;he determined to &s;it up with her aunt, but this the latter po&s;itively forbade, commanding her to retire to re&s;t, and Annette alone to remain in her chamber. Re&s;t was, indeed ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Emily, who&s;e &s;pirits and frame were equally wearied by the occurrences and exertions of the day; but &s;he would not leave Madame Montoni, till after the turn of midnight, a period then thought &s;o critical by the phy&s;icians. Soon after twelve, having enjoined Annette to be wakeful, and to call her, &s;hould any change appear for the wor&s;e, Emily &s;orrowfully bade Madame Montoni good night, and withdrew to her chamber.&mdash;Her &s;pirits were more than u&s;ually depre&s;&s;ed by the piteous con|dition of her aunt, who&s;e recovery &s;he &s;carcely dared to expect. To her own misfortunes &s;he &s;aw no period, inclo&s;ed as &s;he was, in a remote ca&s;tle, beyond the reach of any friends, had &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch, and beyond the pity even of &s;trangers; while &s;he knew her&s;elf to be in the power of a man capable of any action, which his intere&s;t, or his ambition, might &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>Occupied by melancholy reflections and by anticipations as &s;ad, &s;he did not retire immediately to re&s;t, but leaned thoughtfully on her open ca&s;ement. The &s;cene before her of woods and mountains, repo&s;ing in the moonlight, formed a regretted con|tra&s;t with the &s;tate of her mind; but the lonely murmur of the&s;e woods, and the view of this &s;leeping land&s;cape, gradually &s;oothed her emotions and &s;oftened her to tears.</P>
<P>She continued to weep, for &s;ometime. lo&s;t to every thing, but to a gentle &s;en&s;e of her misfortunes. When &s;he, at length, took the handkerchief from her eyes, &s;he perceived, before her, on the terrace below, the figure &s;he had formerly ob&s;erved, which &s;tood fixed and &s;ilent, immediately oppo&s;ite to her ca&s;ement. On perceiving it, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">arted back, and terror for &s;ometime over|came curio&s;ity; at length, &s;he returned to the ca&s;ement, and &s;till the figure was before it, which &s;he now compelled her&s;elf to ob|&s;erve, but was utterly unable to &s;peak, as &s;he had formerly in|tended. The moon &s;hone with a clear light, and it was, per|haps,
<PB N="150" REF="029378_0189_0FE0839AB4743130">
the agitation of her mind, that prevented her di&s;tingui&s;h|ing, with any degree of accuracy, the form before her. It was &s;till &s;tationary, and &s;he began to doubt, whether it was really an|imated.</P>
<P>Her &s;cattered thoughts were now &s;o far returned as to remind her, that her light expo&s;ed her to dangerous ob&s;ervation, and &s;he was &s;tepping back to remove it, when &s;he perceived the figure move, and then wave what &s;eemed to be its arm, as if to beckon her; and while &s;he gazed, fixed in fear, it repeated the action. She now attempted to &s;peak, but the words died on her lips, and &s;he went from the ca&s;ement to remove her light, as &s;he was do|ing which, &s;he heard, from without, a faint groan. Li&s;tening, but not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to return, &s;he pre&s;ently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eard it repeated.</P>
<P>"Good God!&mdash;what can this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">!" &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Again &s;he li&s;tened, but the &s;ound came no more; and, after a long interval of &s;ilence, &s;he recovered courage enough to go to the ca&s;ement, when &s;he again &s;aw the &s;ame appearance! It beck|oned again, and again uttered a low &s;ound.</P>
<P>"That groan was &s;urely human!" &s;aid &s;he, "I <HI>will</HI> &s;peak."</P>
<P>"Who is it," cried Emily in a faint voice, "that wanders at this late hour?"</P>
<P>The figure rai&s;ed its head but &s;uddenly &s;tarted away, and glided down the terrace. She watched it for a long while, pa&s;|&s;ing &s;wiftly in the moonlight, but heard no foot&s;tep, till a &s;entinel from the other extremity of the rampart walked &s;lowly along. The man &s;topped under her window, and looking up, called her by name. She was retiring precipitately, but a &s;e|cond &s;ummons inducing her to reply, the &s;oldier then re&s;pectful|ly a&s;ked if &s;he had &s;een any thing pa&s;s. On her an&s;wering, that &s;he had; he &s;aid no more, but walked away down the terrace, Emily following him with her eyes, till he was lo&s;t in the di&s;|tance. But, as he was on guard, &s;he knew he could not go be|yond the rampart, and therefore re&s;olved to await his return.</P>
<P>Soon after, his voice was heard, at a di&s;tance, calling loudly; and then a voice &s;till more di&s;tant an&s;wered, and, in the next mo|ment, the watchword was given, and pa&s;&s;ed along the terrace. As the &s;oldiers moved ha&s;tily under the ca&s;ement, &s;he called to inquire what had happened, but they pa&s;&s;ed without regarding her.</P>
<P>Emily's thoughts returning to the figure &s;he had &s;een, "It cannot be a per&s;on, who has de&s;igns upon the ca&s;tle," &s;aid &s;he; "&s;uch an one would conduct him&s;elf very differently. He would not venture were &s;entinels were on watch, nor fix him|&s;elf oppo&s;ite to a window, were he perceived he mu&s;t be ob&s;erv|ed;
<PB N="151" REF="029378_0189_0FE0839AB4743130">
much le&s;s would he beckon, or utter a &s;ound of complaint. Yet it cannot be a pri&s;oner, for how could he obtain the op|portunity to wander thus?"</P>
<P>If &s;he had been &s;ubject to vanity, &s;he might have &s;uppo&s;ed this figure to be &s;ome inhabitant of the ca&s;tle, who wandered under her ca&s;ement in the hope of &s;eeing her, and of being al|lowed to declare his admiration; but this opinion never occur|red to Emily, and, if it had, &s;he would have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it as im|probable, on con&s;idering, that, when the opportunity of &s;peaking had occurred, it had been &s;uffered to pa&s;s in &s;ilence; and that, even at the moment in which &s;he had &s;poken, the form had ab|ruptly quitted the place.</P>
<P>While &s;he mu&s;ed, two &s;entinels walked up the rampart in ear|ne&s;t conver&s;ation, of which &s;he caught a few words, and learned from the&s;e, that one of their comrades had fallen down &s;en&s;ele&s;s. Soon after, three other &s;oldiers appeared &s;lowly advancing from the bottom of the terrace, but &s;he heard only a low voice, that came at intervals. As they drew near, &s;he perceived this to be the voice of him, who walked in the middle, apparently &s;upport|ed by his comrades; and &s;he again called to them, inquiring what had happened. At the &s;ound of her voice, they &s;topped, and looked up, while &s;he repeated her que&s;tion and was told, that Roberto, their fellow of the watch, had been &s;eized with a fit, and that his cry, as he fell bad cau&s;ed a fal&s;e alarm.</P>
<P>"Is he &s;ubject to fits?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, Signora," replied Roberto; "but if I had not, what I &s;aw was enough to have frightened the Pope him&s;elf."</P>
<P>"What was it?" inquired Emily, trembling.</P>
<P>"I cannot tell what it was, lady, or what I &s;aw, or how it, vani&s;hed," replied the &s;oldier, who &s;eemed to &s;hudder at the re|collection.</P>
<P>"Was it the per&s;on whom you followed down the rampart, that has occa&s;ioned you this alarm?" &s;aid Emily, endeavouring to conceal her own.</P>
<P>"Per&s;on!" exclaimed the man,&mdash;"it was the devil, and this is not the fir&s;t time I have &s;een him!"</P>
<P>"Nor will it be the la&s;t," ob&s;erved one of his comrades laughing.</P>
<P>"No, no, I warrant not," &s;aid another.</P>
<P>"Well," rejoined Roberto, "you may be as merry now, as you plea&s;e; you was none &s;o joco&s;e the other night, Seba&s;tian, when you was on watch with Launcelot."</P>
<P>"Launcelot need not talk of that," replied Seba&s;tian, "let him remember how he &s;tood trembling, and unable to give the
<PB N="152" REF="029378_0190_0FE0839F508B6D88">
<HI>word,</HI> till the man was gone. If the man had not come &s;o &s;ilent|ly upon us, I would have &s;eized him, and &s;oon made him tell who he was."</P>
<P>"What man?" inquired Emily.</P>
<P>"It was no man, lady," &s;aid Launcelot, who &s;tood by, "but the devil him&s;elf as my comrade &s;ays. What man, who does not live in the ca&s;tle, could get within the walls at midnight? Why, I might ju&s;t as well pretend to march to Venice and get among all the Senators, when they are coun&s;elling; and I war|rant I &s;hould have more chance of getting out again alive, than any fellow, that we &s;hould catch within the gates after dark. So I think I have proved plainly enough, that this can be no|body that lives out of the ca&s;tle; and now I will prove, that it can be nobody that lives in the ca&s;tle&mdash;for, if he did&mdash;why &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e be afraid to be &s;een? So after this, I hope nobody will pretend to tell me it was any body. No, I &s;ay again, by holy Pope! it was the devil, and Seba&s;tian, there, knows this is not the fir&s;t time we have &s;een him."</P>
<P>"When did you &s;ee the figure, then, before?" &s;aid Emily half &s;miling, who, though &s;he thought the conver&s;ation &s;omewhat too much, felt an intere&s;t, which would not permit her to con|clude it.</P>
<P>"About" week ago, lady," &s;aid Seba&s;tian, taking up the &s;tory.</P>
<P>"And where?"</P>
<P>"On the rampart, lady, higher up."</P>
<P>"Did you pur&s;ue it, that it fled?"</P>
<P>"No, Signora. Launcelot and I were on watch together, and every thing was &s;o &s;till, you might have heard a mou&s;e &s;tir, when, &s;uddenly, Launcelot &s;ays&mdash;Seba&s;tian! do you &s;ee nothing? I turned my head a little to the left, as it might be&mdash;thus.&mdash;No, &s;ays I. Hu&s;h! &s;aid Launcelot,&mdash;look yonder&mdash;ju&s;t by the la&s;t cannon on the rampart! I looked, and then thought I did &s;ee &s;omething move; but there being no light, but what the &s;tars gave, I could not be certain. We &s;tood quite &s;ilent, to watch it, and pre&s;ently &s;aw &s;omething pa&s;s along the ca&s;tle wall ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to us!"</P>
<P>"Why did not you &s;eize it, then?" cried a &s;oldier, who had &s;carcely &s;poken till now.</P>
<P>"Aye, why did you not &s;eize it?" &s;aid Roberto.</P>
<P>"You &s;hould have been there to have done that," replied Se|ba&s;tian. "You would have been bold enough to have taken it by the throat, though it had been the devil him&s;elf; we could not take &s;uch a liberty, perhaps becau&s;e we are not &s;o well ac|quainted

with him, as you are. But, as I was &s;aying, it &s;tole by us &s;o quickly, that we had not time to get rid of our &s;urpri&s;e, before it was gone. Then, we knew it was in vain to follow.&mdash;We kept con&s;tant watch all that night, but we &s;aw it no more. Next morning, we told &s;ome of our comrades, who were on du|ty on other parts of the ramparts, what we had &s;een; but they had &s;een nothing, and laughed at us, and it was not till to night, that the &s;ame figure walked again."</P>
<P>"Where did you lo&s;e it, friend?" &s;aid Emily to Roberto.</P>
<P>"When I left you, lady," replied the man, "you might &s;ee me go down the rampart, but it was not till I reached the ea&s;t terrace, that I &s;aw any thing. Then, the moon &s;hining bright, I &s;aw &s;omething like a &s;hadow flitting before me, as it were, at &s;ome di&s;tance. I &s;topped, when I turned the corner of the ea&s;t tower, where I had &s;een this figure not a moment before,&mdash;but it was gone! As I &s;tood, looking through the old arch, which leads to the ea&s;t rampart, and where I am &s;ure it had pa&s;&s;ed, I heard, all of a &s;udden, &s;uch a &s;ound!&mdash;It was not like a groan, or a cry, or a &s;hout, or any thing I ever heard in my life. I heard it only once, and that was enough for me; for I know nothing that hap|pened after, till I found my comrades, here, about me."</P>
<P>"Come," &s;aid Seba&s;tian, "let us go to our po&s;ts&mdash;the moon is &s;etting. Good night, lady!"</P>
<P>"Aye, let us go," rejoined Roberto. "Good night, lady."</P>
<P>"Good night; the holy mother guard you!" &s;aid Emily, as &s;he clo&s;ed her ca&s;ement and retired to reflect upon the &s;trange circum&s;tance that had ju&s;t occurred, connecting which with what had happened on former nights, &s;he endeavoured to derive from the whole &s;omething more po&s;itive than conjecture. But her im|agination was inflamed, wile her judgment was not enlightened, and the terrors of &s;uper&s;tition again pervaded her mind.</P>

<P>IN the morning, Emily found Madame Montoni nearly in the &s;ame condition, as on the preceding night; &s;he had &s;lept little, and that little had not refre&s;hed her; &s;he &s;miled on her niece, and &s;eemed cheered by her pre&s;ence, but &s;poke only a few words,
<PB N="154" REF="029378_0191_0FE083A9B1159510">
and never named Montoni, who, however, &s;oon after, entered the room. His wife, when &s;he under&s;tood that he was there, appeared much agitated, but was entirely &s;ilent, till Emily ro&s;e from a chair at the bed &s;ide, when &s;he begged in a feeble voice, that &s;he would not leave her.</P>
<P>The vi&s;it of Montoni was not to &s;ooth his wife, whom he knew to be dying, or to con&s;ole, or to a&s;k her forgivene&s;s, but to make a la&s;t effort to procure that &s;ignature, which would transfer her e&s;tates in Languedoc, after her death, to him, rather than to Emily. This was a &s;cene, that exhibited on his part, his u&s;ual inhumanity, and, on that of Madame Montoni, a per&s;evering &s;pirit, contending with a feeble frame; while Emily repeatedly declared to him her willingne&s;s to re&s;ign all claim to tho&s;e e&s;tates, rather than that the la&s;t hours of her aunt &s;hould be di&s;|turbed by contention. Montoni, however, did not leave the room, till his wife, exhau&s;ted by the ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, had faint|ed, and &s;he lay &s;o long in&s;en&s;ible, that Emily began to fear that the &s;park of life was extingui&s;hed. At length, &s;he revived, and, looking feebly up at her niece, who&s;e tears were falling over her, made an effort to &s;peak, but her words were unintelligible, and Emily again apprehended &s;he was dying. Afterwards, however, &s;he recovered her &s;peech, and, being &s;omewhat re&s;tored by a cordial, conver&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time, on the &s;ubject of her e&s;tates in France, with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion. She directed her niece where to find &s;ome papers relative to them, which &s;he had hitherto concealed from the &s;earch of Montoni, and earne&s;t|ly charged her never to &s;uffer the&s;e papers to e&s;cape her.</P>
<P>Soon after this conver&s;ation, Madame Montoni &s;unk into a do&s;e, and continued &s;lumbering, till evening, when &s;he &s;eemed better than &s;he had been &s;ince her removal from the &punc;turret.&mdash;Emily never left her, for a moment, till long after midnight, and even then would not have quitted the room, had not her aunt entreated, that &s;he would retire to re&s;t. She then obeyed, the more willingly, becau&s;e her patient appeared &s;omewhat recruit|ed by &s;leep; and, giving Annette the &s;ame injunction, as on the preceding night, &s;he withdrew to her own apartment. But her &s;pirits were wakeful and agitated, and, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;leep, &s;he determined to watch, once more, for the my&s;terious appearance that had &s;o much intere&s;ted and alarmed her.</P>
<P>It was now the &s;econd watch of the night, and about the time when the figure had before appeared. Emily heard the pa&s;&s;ing &s;teps of the &s;entinels, on the rampart, as they changed guard; and, when all was again &s;ilent, &s;he took her &s;tation at the ca&s;e|ment,
<PB N="155" REF="029378_0191_0FE083A9B1159510">
leaving her lamp in a remote part of the chamber, that &s;he might e&s;cape notice from without. The moon gave a faint and uncertain light, for heavy vapours &s;urrounded it, and, often rolling over the di&s;k, left the &s;cene below in total dark|ne&s;s. It was in one of the&s;e moments of ob&s;curity, that &s;he ob|&s;erved a &s;mall and lambent flame, moving at &s;ome di&s;tance on the terrace. While &s;he gazed, it di&s;appeared, and the moon again emerging from the lurid and heavy thunder clouds, &s;he turned her attention to the heavens, where the vivid lightnings darted from cloud to cloud, and fla&s;hed &s;ilently on the woods be|low. She loved to catch in the momentary gleam, the gloomy land&s;cape. Sometimes, a cloud opened its light upon a di&s;tant mountain, and while the &s;udden &s;plendour illumined all its re|ce&s;&s;es of rock and wood, the re&s;t of the &s;cene remained in deep &s;hadow; at others, partial features of the ca&s;tle were revealed by the glimp&s;e&mdash;the ancient arch leading to the ea&s;t rampart, the turret above, or the fortifications beyond; and then, perhaps, the whole edifice with all its towers its dark ma&s;&s;y walls and pointed ca&s;ements would appear and vani&s;h in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Emily, looking again upon the rampart, perceived the flame &s;he had &s;een before; it moved onward; and, &s;oon after, &s;he thought &s;he heard a foot&s;tep. The light appeared and di&s;ap|peared frequently, while, as &s;he watched, it glided under her ca&s;ements, and, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, &s;he was certain, that a foot|&s;tep pa&s;&s;ed, but the darkne&s;s did not permit her to di&s;tingui&s;h any object except the flame. It moved away, and then, by a gleam of lightning, &s;he perceived &s;ome per&s;on on the terrace.&mdash;All the anxieties of the preceding night returned. This per&s;on advanced, and the playing flame alternately appeared and van|i&s;hed. Emily wi&s;hed to &s;peak, to end her doubts, whether this figure were human or &s;upernatural; but her courage failed as often as &s;he attempted utterance, till the light moved again un|der the ca&s;ement, and &s;he faintly demanded who pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"A friend," replied a voice.</P>
<P>"What friend?" &s;aid Emily, &s;omewhat encouraged, "who are you, and what is that light you carry?"</P>
<P>"I am Anthonio, one of the Signor's &s;oldiers," replied the voice.</P>
<P>"And what is that tapering light you bear?" &s;aid Emily, "See how it darts upwards,&mdash;and now it vani&s;hes!"</P>
<P>"This light, lady," &s;aid the &s;oldier, "has appeared to night as you &s;ee it, on the point of my lance, ever &s;ince I have been on watch; but what it means I cannot tell."</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="029378_0192_0FE083AFAD90EEA8">
"This is very &s;trange!" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"My fellow guard," continued the man, "has the &s;ame flame on his arms; he &s;ays he has &s;ometimes &s;een it before. I never did; I am but lately come to the ca&s;tle, for I have not been long a &s;oldier."</P>
<P>"How does your comrade account for it?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"He &s;ays it is an omen, lady, and bodes no good."</P>
<P>"And what harm can it bode?" rejoined Emily.</P>
<P>"He knows not &s;o much as that, lady."</P>
<P>Whether Emily was alarmed by this omen, or not, &s;he cer|tainly was relieved from much terror by di&s;covering this man to be only a &s;oldier on duty, and it immediately occurred to her, that it might be him, who had occa&s;ioned &s;o much alarm on the preceding night. There were, however, &s;ome circum&s;tances, that &s;till required explanation. As far as &s;he could judge by the faint moonlight, that had a&s;&s;i&s;ted her ob&s;ervation, the figure &s;he had &s;een did not re&s;emble this man either in &s;hape or &s;ize; be&s;ides, &s;he was certain it had carried no arms. The &s;ilence of its &s;teps, if &s;teps it had, the moaning &s;ounds, too, which it had uttered, and its &s;trange di&s;appearance, were circum&s;tances of my&s;terious import, that did not apply, with probability, to a &s;oldier engaged in the duty of his guard.</P>
<P>She now inquired of the &s;entinel, whether he had &s;een any per&s;on be&s;ides his fellow watch, walking on the terrace, about midnight; and then briefly related what &s;he had her&s;elf ob|&s;erved.</P>
<P>"I was not on guard that night, lady," replied the man, "but I heard of what happened. There are among&s;t us, who believe &s;trange things. Strange &s;tories, too, have long been told of this ca&s;tle, but it is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine to repeat them; and, for my part, I have no rea&s;on to complain; our Chief does no|bly by us."</P>
<P>"I commend your prudence," &s;aid Emily, "Good night, and accept this from me," &s;he added, throwing him a &s;mall piece of coin, and then clo&s;ing the ca&s;ement to put an end to the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>When he was gone, &s;he opened it again, li&s;tened with a gloomy plea&s;ure to the di&s;tant thunder, that began to murmur among the mountains, and watched the arrowy lightnings, which broke over the remoter &s;cene. The pealing thunder rolled onward, and then, reverbed by the mountains, other thunder &s;eemed to an&s;wer from the oppo&s;ite horizon; while the accumulating clouds entirely concealing the moon, a&s;&s;umed a red &s;ulphureous tinge, that foretold a violent &s;torm.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="029378_0192_0FE083AFAD90EEA8">
Emily remained at her ca&s;ement, till the vivid lightning that now, every in&s;tant, revealed the wide horizon and the land&s;cape below, made it no longer &s;afe to do &s;o, and &s;he went to her couch; but, unable to compo&s;e her mind to &s;leep, &s;till li&s;tened in &s;ilent awe to the tremendous &s;ounds that &s;eemed to &s;hake the ca&s;tle to its foundation.</P>
<P>She had continued thus for a con&s;iderable time, when, amid&s;t the uproar of the &s;torm, &s;he thought &s;he heard a voice, and, rai&s;|ing her&s;elf to li&s;ten, &s;aw the chamber door open, and Annette enter with a countenance of wild affright.</P>
<P>"She is dying, ma'am&s;elle, my lady is dying," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Emily &s;tarted up, and ran to Madame Montoni's room. When &s;he entered, her aunt appeared to have fainted, for &s;he was quite &s;till, and in&s;en&s;ible; and Emily with a &s;trength of mind, that refu&s;ed to yield to grief, while any duty required her activity, applied every means that &s;eemed likely to re&s;tore her. But the la&s;t &s;truggle was over&mdash;&s;he was gone for ever.</P>
<P>When Emily perceived, that all her efforts were ineffectual, &s;he interrogated the terrified Annette, and learned that Madame Montoni had fallen into a doze, &s;oon after Emily's departure, in which &s;he had continued, until a few minutes before her death.</P>
<P>"I wondered, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "what was the rea&s;on my lady did not &s;eem frightened at the thunder, when I was &s;o terrified, and I went often to the bed to &s;peak to her, but &s;he appeared to be a&s;leep; till pre&s;ently I heard a &s;trange noi&s;e, and, on going to her &s;aw &s;he was dying."</P>
<P>Emily, at this recital, &s;hed tears. She had no doubt but that the violent change in the air, which the tempe&s;t produced, had ef|fected this fatal one, on the exhau&s;ted frame of Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>After &s;ome deliberation, &s;he determined that Montoni &s;hould not be informed of this event till the morning, for &s;he con&s;ider|ed, that he might, perhaps, utter &s;ome inhuman expre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as in the pre&s;ent temper of her &s;pirits &s;he could not bear. With Annette alone, therefore, whom &s;he encouraged by her own ex|ample, &s;he performed &s;ome of the la&s;t &s;olemn offices for the dead, and compelled her&s;elf to watch during the night, by the body of her decea&s;ed aunt. During this &s;olemn period, rendered more awful by the tremendous &s;torm that &s;hook the air, &s;he frequently addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven for &s;upport and protection, and her pious prayers we may believe, were accepted of the God, that giveth comfort.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN Montoni was informed of the death of his wife, and con&s;idered that &s;he had died without giving him the &s;igna|ture &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes, no &s;en&s;e of decency re&s;trained the expre&s;&s;ion of his re&s;entment. Emily anxiou&s;ly avoided his pre&s;ence, and watched, during two days and two nights, with little intermi&s;&s;ion, by the corps of her late aunt. Her mind deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the unhappy fate of this object, &s;he forgot all her faults, her unju&s;t and imperious conduct to her&s;elf; and, remembering only her &s;ufferings, thought of her only with tender compa&s;&s;ion. Sometimes, however, &s;he could not avoid mu&s;ing upon the &s;trange infatuation that had proved &s;o fatal to her aunt, and had involved her&s;elf in a labyrinth of mi&s;|fortune, from which &s;he &s;aw no means of e&s;caping,&mdash;the mar|riage with Montoni. But, when &s;he con&s;idered this circum|&s;tance, it was "more in &s;orrow than in anger,"&mdash;more for the purpo&s;e of indulging lamentation than reproach.</P>
<P>In her pious cares &s;he was not di&s;turbed by Montoni, who not only avoided the chamber, where the remains of his wife were laid, but that part of the ca&s;tle adjoining to it, as if he had apprehended a contagion in death. He &s;eemed to have given no orders re&s;pecting the funeral, and Emily began to fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e meant to offer a new in&s;ult to the memory of Madame Montoni; but from this apprehen&s;ion &s;he was relieved, when, on the even|ing of the &s;econd day, Annette informed her, that the interment was to take place that night. She knew, that Montoni would not attend; and it was &s;o very grievous to her to think that the remains of her unfortunate aunt would pa&s;s to the grave with|out one relative, or friend to pay them the la&s;t decent rites, that &s;he determined to be deterred by no con&s;iderations for her&s;elf, from ob&s;erving this duty. She would otherwi&s;e have &s;hrunk from the circum&s;tance of following them to the cold vault, to which they were to be carried by men, who&s;e air and counte|nance &s;eemed to &s;tamp them for murderers, at the midnight hour of &s;ilence and privacy, which Montoni had cho&s;en for com|mitting, if po&s;&s;ible, to oblivion the reliques of a woman, whom his har&s;h conduct had at lea&s;t contributed to de&s;troy.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="029378_0193_0FE083BA1E9A7518">
Emily &s;huddering with emotions of horror and grief, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Annette, prepared the corp&s;e for interment; and, having wrapt it in cerements, and covered it with a winding&s;heet, they watched be&s;ide it, till pa&s;t midnight, when they heard the ap|proaching foot&s;teps of the men, who were to lay it in its earthy bed. It was with difficulty, that Emily overcame her emotion, when the door of the chamber being thrown open, their gloomy countenances were &s;een by the glare of the torch they carried, and two of them, without &s;peaking, lifted the body on their &s;houlders, while the third preceding them with the light, de|&s;cended through the ca&s;tle towards the grave, which was in the lower vault of the chapel within the ca&s;tle walls.</P>
<P>They had to cro&s;s two courts, towards the ea&s;t wing of the ca&s;tle, which, adjoining the chapel, was, like it, in ruins: but the &s;ilence and gloom of the&s;e courts had now little power over Emily's mind, occupied as it was, with more mournful ideas; and &s;he &s;carcely heard the low and di&s;mal hooting of the night|birds, that roo&s;ted among the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vyed battlements of the ruin, or perceived the &s;till flittings of the bat, which frequently cro&s;&s;ed her way. But, when, having entered the chapel, and pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the mouldering pillars of the ai&s;les, the bearers &s;topped at a flight of &s;teps, that led down to a low arched door, and, their comrade having de&s;cended to unlock it, &s;he &s;aw imperfectly the gloomy aby&s;s beyond;&mdash;&s;aw the corp&s;e of her aunt carried down the&s;e &s;teps, and the ruffian-like figure, that &s;tood with a torch at the bottom to receive it&mdash;all her fortitude was lo&s;t in emotions of inexpre&s;&s;ible grief and terror. She turned to lean upon An|nette, who was cold and trembling like her&s;elf, and &s;he lingered &s;o long on the &s;ummit of the flight, that the gleam of the torch began to die away on the pillars of the chapel, and the men were almo&s;t beyond her view. Then, the gloom around her awakening other fears, and a &s;en&s;e of what &s;he con&s;idered to be her duty overcoming her reluctance, &s;he de&s;cended to the vaults, following, the echo of foot&s;teps and the faint ray, that pierced the darkne&s;s, till the har&s;h grating of a di&s;tant door, that was open|ed to receive the corp&s;e, again appalled her.</P>
<P>After the pau&s;e of a moment, &s;he went on, and, as &s;he enter|ed the vaults, &s;aw between the arches, at &s;ome di&s;tance, the men lay down the body near the edge of an open grave, where &s;tood another of Montoni's men and a prie&s;t, whom &s;he did not ob|&s;erve, till he began the burial &s;ervice; then, lifting her eyes from the ground, &s;he &s;aw the venerable figure of the friar, and heard him in a low voice, equally &s;olemn and affecting, perform
<PB N="160" REF="029378_0194_0FE082B458FCFCE8">
the &s;ervice for the dead. At the moment, in which they let down the body into the earth, the &s;cene was &s;uch as only the dark pencil of a Domenichino, perhaps, could have done ju&s;tice to. The fierce features and wild dre&s;s of the <HI>condottieri,</HI> bend|ing with their torches over the grave, into which the corp&s;e was de&s;cending, were contra&s;ted by the venerable figure of the monk, wrapt in long black garments, his cowl thrown back from his pale face, on which the light gleaming &s;trongly &s;hewed the lines of affliction &s;oftened by piety, and the few grey locks, which time had &s;pared on his temples: while, be&s;ide him, &s;tood the &s;ofter form of Emily, who leaned for &s;upport upon Annette; her face half averted, and &s;haded by a thin veil, that fell over her figure; and her mild and beautiful countenance fixed in grief &s;o &s;olemn as admitted not of tears, while &s;he thus &s;aw com|mitted untimely to the earth her la&s;t relative and friend. The gleams, thrown between the arches of the vaults, where, here and there, the broken ground marked the &s;pots in which other bodies had been recently interred, and the general ob&s;curity beyond were circum&s;tances, that alone would have led on the imagina|tion of a &s;pectator to &s;cenes more horrible, than even that, which was pictured at the grave of the mi&s;guided and unfortunate Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervice was over, the friar regarded Emily with atten|tion and &s;urpri&s;e, and looked as if he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to her, but was re&s;trained by the pre&s;ence of the condottieri, who as they now led the way to the courts, amu&s;ed them&s;elves with jokes upon his holy order, which he endured in &s;ilence, demanding only to be conducted &s;afely to his convent, and to which Emily li&s;tened with concern and even horror. When they reached the court, the monk gave her his ble&s;&s;ing, and, after a lingering look of pity, turned away to the portal, whither one of the men carried a torch; while Annette, lighting another, preceded Emily to her apartment. The appearance of the friar and the expre&s;&s;ion of tender compa&s;&s;ion, with which he had regarded her, had in|tere&s;ted Emily, who, though it was at her earne&s;t &s;upplication, that Montoni had con&s;ented to allow a prie&s;t to perform the la&s;t rites for his decea&s;ed wife, knew nothing concerning this per&s;on, till Annette now informed her, that he belonged to a mona&s;tery, &s;ituated among the mountains at a few miles di&s;tance. The Su|perior, who regarded Montoni and his a&s;&s;ociates, not only with aver&s;ion, but with terror, had probably feared to offend him by refu&s;ing his reque&s;t, and had, therefore, ordered a monk to offi|ciate at the funeral, who, with the meek &s;pirit of a chri&s;tian,
<PB N="161" REF="029378_0194_0FE082B458FCFCE8">
had overcome his reluctance to enter the walls of &s;uch a ca&s;tle, by the wi&s;h of performing what he con&s;idered to be his duty, and, as the chapel was built on con&s;ecrated ground, had not ob|jected to commit to it the remains of the late unhappy Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>Several days pa&s;&s;ed with Emily in total &s;eclu&s;ion, and in a &s;tate of mind, partaking both of terror for her&s;elf, and grief for the departed. She, at length, determined to make other efforts to per&s;uade Montoni to permit her to return to France. Why he &s;hould wi&s;h to detain her, &s;he could &s;carcely date to conjec|ture; but it was too certain that he did &s;o, and the ab&s;olute re|fu&s;al he had formerly given to her departure allowed her little hope, that he would now con&s;ent to it. But the horror, which his pre&s;ence in&s;pired, made her defer, from day to day, the men|tion of this &s;ubject; and at la&s;t &s;he was awakened from her inac|tivity only by a me&s;&s;age from him, de&s;iring her attendance at a certain hour. She began to hope he meant to re&s;ign, now that her aunt was no more, the authority he had u&s;urped over her; till &s;he recollected, that the e&s;tates, which had occa&s;ioned &s;o much contention, were now hers, and &s;he then feared Montoni was about to employ &s;ome &s;tratagem for obtaining them, and that he would detain her his pri&s;oner, till he &s;ucceeded. This thought, in&s;tead of overcoming her with de&s;pondency, rou&s;ed all the latent powers of her fortitude into action; and the property, which &s;he would willingly have re&s;igned to &s;ecure the peace of her aunt, &s;he re&s;olved, that no common &s;ufferings of her own &s;hould ever compel her to give to Montoni. For Valancourt's &s;ake al&s;o &s;he determined to pre&s;erve the&s;e e&s;tates, &s;ince they would afford that competency, by which &s;he hoped to &s;ecure the comfort of their future lives. As &s;he thought of this &s;he indulg|ed the tenderne&s;s of tears, and anticipated the delight of that moment, when, with affectionate genero&s;ity, &s;he might tell him they were his own. She &s;aw the &s;mile, that lighted up his fea|tures&mdash;the affectionate regard, which &s;poke at once his joy and thanks; and, at this in&s;tant, &s;he believed &s;he could brave any &s;uffering which the evil &s;pirit of Montoni might be preparing for her. Remembering then, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince her aunt's death, the papers relative to the e&s;tates in que&s;tion, &s;he deter|mined to &s;earch for them, as &s;oon as her interview with Mon|toni was over.</P>
<P>With the&s;e re&s;olutions &s;he met him at the appointed time, and waited to hear his intention before &s;he renewed her reque&s;t. With him were Or&s;ino, and another officer, and both were &s;tand|ing
<PB N="162" REF="029378_0195_0FE083CF60FE9050">
near a table, covered with papers, which he appeared to be examining.</P>
<P>"I &s;ent for you, Emily," &s;aid Montoni, rai&s;ing his head, "that you might be a witne&s;s in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, which I am tran&s;acting with my friend Or&s;ino. All that is required of you will be to &s;ign your name to this paper:" he then took one up, hurried unintelligibly over &s;ome lines, and, laying it before her on the table, offered her a pen. She took it, and was going to write&mdash;when the de&s;ign of Montoni came upon her mind like a fla&s;h of lightning; &s;he trembled, let the pen fall, and refu&s;ed to &s;ign what &s;he had not read. Montoni affected to laugh at her &s;cruples, and, taking up the paper, again pretended to read; but Emily, who &s;till trembled on perceiving her danger, and was a&s;toni&s;hed, that her own credulity had &s;o nearly betrayed her, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to &s;ign any paper whatever. Montoni, for &s;ometime, per&s;evered in affecting to ridicule this refu&s;al; but, when he perceived by her &s;teady per&s;everance, that &s;he under&s;tood his de&s;ign, he changed his manner, and bade her follow him to another room. There he told her, that he had been willing to &s;pare him&s;elf and her the trouble of u&s;ele&s;s conte&s;t, in an affair where his will was ju&s;tice, and where &s;he &s;hould find it law; and had, therefore, endeavoured to per&s;uade, rather than to compel, her to the practice of her duty.</P>
<P>"I, as the hu&s;band of the late Signora Montoni," he added, "am the heir of all &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; the e&s;tates, therefore, which &s;he refu&s;ed to me in her lifetime, can no longer be withheld, and, for your own &s;ake, I would undeceive you, re&s;pecting a fooli&s;h a&s;&s;ertion &s;he once made to you in my hearing&mdash;that the&s;e e&s;tates would be yours, if &s;he died without re&s;igning them to me. She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at that moment, &s;he had no power to withhold them from me, after her decea&s;e; and I think you have more &s;en&s;e, than to provoke my re&s;entment by advancing an unju&s;t claim.

If I under&s;tand your di&s;po&s;ition and your mind, you hold in &s;overeign contempt the&s;e common failings of your &s;ex."</P>
<P>Montoni <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">au&s;ed; and Emily remained &s;ilent and expecting; for &s;he knew him too well, to believe he would conde&s;cend to

&s;uch flattery, unle&s;s he thought it would promote his own in|tere&s;t; and, though he had forborne to name vanity among the foibles of wome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, it was evident, that he con&s;idered it to be a predominant one, &s;ince he de&s;igned to &s;acrifice to hers the character and under&s;tanding of her whole &s;ex.</P>
<P>"Judging as I do," re&s;umed Montoni, "I cannot believe you will oppo&s;e, where you know you cannot conquer, or, indeed, that you would wi&s;h to conquer, or be avaricious of any pro|perty, when you have not ju&s;tice on your &s;ide. I think it pro|per, however, to acquaint you with the alternative. If you have a ju&s;t opinion of the &s;ubject in que&s;tion, you &s;hall be allowed a &s;afe conveyance to France, within a &s;hort period; but, if you are &s;o unhappy as to be mi&s;led by the late a&s;&s;ertion of the Sig|nora, you &s;hall remain my pri&s;oner, till you are convinced of your error."</P>
<P>Emily calmly &s;aid,</P>
<P>"I am not &s;o ignorant, Signor, of the laws on this &s;ubject, as to be mi&s;led by the a&s;&s;ertion of any per&s;on. The law, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, gives me the e&s;tates in que&s;tion, and my own hand &s;hall never betray my right."</P>
<P>"I have been mi&s;taken in my opinion of you, it appears," re|joined Montoni, &s;ternly. "You &s;peak boldly, and pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly, upon a &s;ubject, which you do not under&s;tand. For once, I am willing to pardon the conceit of ignorance; the weakne&s;s of your &s;ex, too, from which, it &s;eems you are not exempt, claims &s;ome allowance; but, if you per&s;i&s;t in this &s;train&mdash;you have every thing to fear from my ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>"From your ju&s;tice, Signor," rejoined Emily, "I have noth|ing to fear&mdash;I have only to hope."</P>
<P>Montoni looked at her with vexation, and &s;eemed con&s;idering what to &s;ay. "I find that you are weak enough," he re&s;umed, "to credit the idle a&s;&s;ertion I alluded to! For your own &s;ake I lament this; as to me, it is of little con&s;equence. Your credu|lity can puni&s;h only your&s;elf; and I mu&s;t pity the weakne&s;s of mind, which leads you to &s;o much &s;uffering as you are compel|ling me to prepare for you."</P>
<P>"You may find, perhaps, Signor," &s;aid Emily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mild dig|nity, "that the &s;trength of my mind is equal to the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e; and that I can endure with fortitude, when it is in re&s;i&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">pre&s;&s;ion."</P>

Recollecting, that it was for Valancourt's &s;ake &s;he had thou re&s;i&s;ted, &s;he now &s;miled complacently upon the threatened &s;uf|ferings, and retired to the &s;pot, which her aunt had pointed out as the repo&s;itory of the papers, relative to the e&s;tates, where &s;he found them as de&s;cribed; and, &s;ince &s;he knew of no better place of concealment, than this, returned them, without examining their contents, being fearful of di&s;covery, while &s;he &s;hould at|tempt a peru&s;al.</P>
<P>To her own &s;olitary chamber &s;he once more returned, and there thought again of the late conver&s;ation with Montoni, and of the evil &s;he might expect from oppo&s;ition to his will. But his power did not appear &s;o terrible to her imagination, as it was wont to do: a &s;acred pride was in her heart, that taught it to &s;well again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of inju&s;tice, and almo&s;t to glory in the quiet &s;ufferance of ills, in a cau&s;e, which had al&s;o the inter|e&s;t of Valancourt for its object. For the fir&s;t time, &s;he felt the full extent of her own &s;uperiority to Montoni, and de&s;pi&s;ed the authority, which, till now, &s;he had only feared.</P>

She gazed in an a&s;toni&s;hment that made her remain at the window, regardle&s;s of being ob&s;erved, till the group pa&s;&s;ed under it; and, one of the &s;trangers looking up, &s;he perceived the features of Signora Livona, with who&s;e manners &s;he had been &s;o much charmed, the day after her ar|rival at Venice, and who had been there introduced at the table of Montoni. This di&s;covery occa&s;ioned her an emotion of doubtful joy; for it was matter of joy and comfort to know, that a per&s;on, of a mind &s;o gentle, as that of Signora Livona &s;eemed to be, was near her; yet there was &s;omething &s;o extra|ordinary in her being at this ca&s;tle, circum&s;tanced as know was, and evidently, by the gaiety of her air, with her own con&s;ent, that a very painful &s;urmi&s;e aro&s;e, concerning her character. But the thought was &s;o &s;hocking to Emily, who&s;e affection the fa&s;|cinating manners of the Signora had won, and appeared &s;o im|probable, when &s;he remembered the&s;e manners, that &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it almo&s;t in&s;tantly.</P>

once again.&mdash;But what can they mean by coming here? They mu&s;t &s;urely be &s;tark mad to come freely to &s;uch a place as this! Yet they do come freely, for they &s;eem merry enough, I am &s;ure."</P>
<P>"They were taken pri&s;oners, perhaps?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Taken pri&s;oners!" exclaimed Annette; "no, indeed, ma'am&s;elle, not they. I remember one of them very well at Venice: &s;he came two or three times to the Signor's, you know, ma'am&s;elle, and it was &s;aid, but I did not believe a word of it&mdash;it was &s;aid, that the Signor liked her better than he &s;hould do. Then, why, &s;ays I, bring her to my lady? Very true, &s;aid Lu|dovico; but he looked as if he knew more, too."</P>
<P>Emily de&s;ired Annette would endeavour to learn who the&s;e ladies were, as well as all &s;he could concerning them; and &s;he then changed the &s;ubject, and &s;poke of di&s;tant France.</P>
<P>"Ah, ma'am&s;elle! we &s;hall never &s;ee it more!" &s;aid An|nette, almo&s;t weeping.&mdash;"I mu&s;t come on my travels, for|&s;ooth!"</P>
<P>Emily tried to &s;ooth and to cheer her with a hope, in which &s;he &s;carcely her&s;elf indulged.</P>
<P>"How&mdash;how, ma'am&s;elle, could you leave France, and leave Mon&s;. Valancourt, too?" &s;aid Annette, &s;obbing. "I&mdash;I&mdash;am &s;ure, if Ludovico had been in France, I would never have left it."</P>
<P>"Why do you lament quitting France, then?" &s;aid Emily, trying to &s;mile, "&s;ince, if you had remained there, you would not have found Ludovico."</P>
<P>"Ah, ma'am&s;elle! I only wi&s;h I was out of this frightful ca&s;tle, &s;erving you in France, and I would care about nothing el&s;e!"</P>
<P>"Thank you, my good Annette, for your affectionate regard, the time will come, I hope, when you may remember the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of that wi&s;h with plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>Annette departed on her bu&s;ine&s;s, and Emily &s;ought to lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of her own cares, in the vi&s;ionary &s;cenes of the poet; but &s;he had again to lament the irre&s;i&s;table force of circum&s;tan|ces over the ta&s;te and powers of the mind; and that it requires a &s;pirit at ea&s;e to be &s;en&s;ible even to the ab&s;tract plea&s;ures of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re intellect. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of genius, with all its pictured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, now appeared cold, and dim. As &s;he mu&s;ed upon the book before her, &s;he involuntarily exclaimed, "Are the&s;e, in|deed, the pa&s;&s;ages, that have &s;o often given me exqui&s;ite delight. Where did the charm exi&s;t?&mdash;Was it in my mind, or in the imagination of the poet? It lived in each," &s;aid &s;he pau&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="029378_0197_0FE083E125EA9AA0">
"But the fire of the poet is vain, if the mind of his reader is not tempered like his own, however it may be inferior to his in power."</P>
<P>Emily would have pur&s;ued this train of thinking, becau&s;e it relieved her from more painful reflection, but &s;he found again, that thought cannot always be controlled by will; and hers re|turned to the con&s;ideration of her own &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In the evening, not choo&s;ing to venture down to the ramparts, where &s;he would be expo&s;ed to the rude gaze of Montoni's a&s;&s;o|ciates, &s;he walked for air in the gallery, adjoining her chamber; on reaching the further end of which &s;he heard di&s;tant &s;ounds of merriment and laughter. It was the wild uproar of riot, not the cheering gaiety of tempered mirth; and &s;eemed to come from that part of the ca&s;tle, where Montoni u&s;ually was. Such &s;ounds, at this time, when her aunt had been &s;o few days dead, particularly &s;hocked her, con&s;i&s;tent as they were with the late conduct of Montoni.</P>
<P>As &s;he li&s;tened, &s;he thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed female voices mingling with the laughter, and this confirmed her wor&s;t &s;ur|mi&s;e concerning the character of Signora Livona and her com|panions. It was evident that they had not been brought hither by compul&s;ion; and &s;he beheld her&s;elf in the remote wilds of the Apennine, &s;urrounded by men, whom &s;he con&s;idered to be little le&s;s than ruffians, and their wor&s;t a&s;&s;ociates, amid &s;cenes of vice, from which her &s;oul recoiled in horror. It was at this mo|ment, when the &s;cenes of the pre&s;ent and the future opened to her imagination, that the image of Valancourt failed in its in|fluence, and her re&s;olution &s;hook with dread. She thought &s;he under&s;tood all the horrors, which Montoni was preparing for her, and &s;hrunk from an encounter with &s;uch remor&s;ele&s;s ven|geance, as he could inflict. The di&s;puted e&s;tates &s;he now almo&s;t de|termined to yield at once, whenever he &s;hould again call upon her, that &s;he might regain &s;afety and freedom; but then, the re|membrance of Valancourt would &s;teal to her heart, and plunge her into the di&s;tractions of doubt.</P>
<P>She continued walking in the gallery, till evening threw its melancholy twilight through the painted ca&s;ements, and deepen|ed the gloom of the oak wain&s;coting around her; while the di&s;|tant per&s;pective of the corridor was &s;o much ob&s;cured, as to be di&s;cernable only by the glimmering window, that terminated it.</P>
<P>Along the vaulted halls and pa&s;&s;ages below, peals of laughter echoed faintly, at intervals, to this remote part of the ca&s;tle, and &s;eemed to render the &s;ucceeding &s;tillne&s;s more dreary. Emily, however, unwilling to return to her more forlorn chamber, whi|ther
<PB N="167" REF="029378_0197_0FE083E125EA9AA0">
Annette was not yet come, &s;till paced the gallery. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the door of the apartment, where &s;he had once dared to lift the veil, which di&s;covered to her a &s;pectacle &s;o horrible, that &s;he had never after remembered it, but with emotions of inde&s;|cribable awe, this remembrance &s;uddenly recurred. It now brought with it reflections more terrible, than it had yet done, which the late conduct of Montoni occa&s;ioned; and, ha&s;tening to quit the gallery, while &s;he had power to do &s;o, &s;he heard a &s;udden &s;tep behind her. It might be that of Annette; but, turning fearfully to look, &s;he &s;aw, through the gloom, a tall figure following her, and all the horrors of that chamber ru&s;hed upon her mind. In the next moment, &s;he found her&s;elf cla&s;ped in the arms of &s;ome per&s;on, and heard a deep voice murmur in her ear.</P>
<P>When &s;he had power to &s;peak, or to di&s;tingui&s;h articulated &s;ounds, &s;he demanded who detained her.</P>
<P>"It is I," replied the voice&mdash;"Why are you thus alarmed?"</P>
<P>She looked on the face of the per&s;on who &s;poke, but the feeble light that gleamed through the high ca&s;ement at the end of the gallery, did not permit her to di&s;tingui&s;h the features.</P>
<P>"Whoever you are," &s;aid Emily in a trembling voice, "for heaven's &s;ake let me go!"</P>
<P>"My charming Emily," &s;aid the man, "why will you &s;hut your&s;elf up in this ob&s;cure place, when there is &s;o much gaiety below? Return with me to the cedar parlour, where you will be the faire&s;t ornament of the party; you &s;hall not repent the exchange."</P>
<P>Emily di&s;dained to reply, and &s;till endeavoured to liberate her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Promi&s;e, that you will come," he continued, "and I will relea&s;e you immediately; but fir&s;t give me a reward for &s;o doing."</P>
<P>"Who are you?" demanded Emily, in a tone of mingled terror and indignation, while &s;he &s;till &s;truggled for liberty&mdash;"Who are you, that have the cruelty thus to in&s;ult me?"</P>
<P>"Why call me cruel?" &s;aid the man, "I would remove you from this dreary &s;olitude to a merry party below. Do you not know me?"</P>
<P>Emily now faintly remembered, that he was one of the offi|cers who were with Montoni when &s;he attended him in the morning. "I thank you for the kindne&s;s of your intention," &s;he replied, without appearing to under&s;tand him, "but I wi&s;h for nothing &s;o much as that you would leave me."</P>
<P>"Charming Emily!" &s;aid he, "give up this fooli&s;h whim for &s;olitude, and come with me to the company, and eclip&s;e the
<PB N="168" REF="029378_0198_0FE083E5B4A1B970">
beauties, who make part of it; you, only, are worthy of my love." He attempted to ki&s;s her hand, but the &s;trong impul&s;e of her indignation gave her power to liberate her&s;elf, and &s;he fled towards the chamber. She clo&s;ed the door, before he reached it, having &s;ecured which, &s;he &s;unk in a chair, over|come by terror and by the exertion &s;he had made, while &s;he heard his voice and his attempts to open the door, without having the power to rai&s;e her&s;elf. At length, &s;he perceived him de|part, and had remained, li&s;tening, for a con&s;iderable time, and was &s;omewhat revived by not hearing any &s;ound, when &s;udden|ly &s;he remembered the door of the private &s;tairca&s;e, and that he might enter that way, &s;ince it was fa&s;tened only on the other &s;ide. She then employed her&s;elf in endeavouring to &s;ecure it, in the manner &s;he had formerly done. It appeared to her, that Montoni had already commenced his &s;cheme of vengeance, by withdrawing from her his protection, and &s;he repented of the ra&s;hne&s;s, that had made her brave the power of &s;uch a man.&mdash;To retain the e&s;tates &s;eemed to be now utterly impo&s;&s;ible, and to pre&s;erve her life, perhaps her honour, &s;he re&s;olved, if &s;he &s;hould e&s;cape the horrors of this night, to give up all claims to the e&s;tates, on the morrow, provided Montoni would &s;uffer her to depart from Udolpho.</P>
<P>When &s;he had come to this deci&s;ion, her mind became more compo&s;ed, though &s;he &s;till anxiou&s;ly li&s;tened, and often &s;tarted at ideal &s;ounds, that appeared to i&s;&s;ue from the &s;tairca&s;e.</P>
<P>Having &s;at in darkne&s;s for &s;ome hours, during all which time Annette did not appear, &s;he began to have &s;erious apprehen&s;ions for her; but, not daring to venture down into the ca&s;tle, was compelled to remain in uncertainty, as to the cau&s;e of this un|u&s;ual ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Emily often &s;tole to the &s;tairca&s;e door, to li&s;ten if any &s;tep approached, but &s;till no &s;ound alarmed her: determining, how|ever, to watch, during the night, &s;he once more re&s;ted on her dark and de&s;olate couch, and bathed the pillow with innocent tears. She thought of her decea&s;ed parents and then of the ab|&s;ent Valancourt, and frequently called upon their names; for the profound &s;tillne&s;s, that now reigned, was propitious to the mu|&s;ing &s;orrow of her mind.</P>
<P>While &s;he thus remained, her ear &s;uddenly caught the notes of di&s;tant mu&s;ic, to which &s;he li&s;tened attentively, and &s;oon per|ceiving this to be the in&s;trument &s;he had formerly heard at midnight, &s;he ro&s;e, and &s;tepped &s;oftly to the ca&s;ement, to which the &s;ounds appeared to come from a lower room.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="029378_0198_0FE083E5B4A1B970">
In a few moments their &s;oft melody was accompanied by a voice &s;o full of pathos, that it evidently &s;ang not of imaginary &s;orrows. Its &s;weet and peculiar tones &s;he thought &s;he had &s;ome|where heard before; yet, if this was not fancy, it was, at mo&s;t, a very faint recollection. It &s;tole over her mind, amid&s;t the an|gui&s;h of her pre&s;ent &s;uffering, like a cele&s;tial &s;train, &s;oothing and rea&s;&s;uring her;&mdash;"Plea&s;ant as the gale of &s;pring, that &s;ighs on the hunter's ear, when he awakens from dreams of joy and has heard the mu&s;ic of the &s;pirits of the hill.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O&s;&s;ian.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>But her emotion can &s;carcely be imagined, when &s;he heard &s;ung, with the ta&s;te and &s;implicity of true feeling, one of the popular airs of her native province, to which &s;he had &s;o often li&s;tened with delight, when a child, and which &s;he had &s;o often heard her father repeat! To this well known &s;ong, never till now, heard but in her native country, her heart melted, while, the memory of pa&s;t times returned. The plea&s;ant, peaceful, &s;cenes of Ga&s;cony, the tenderne&s;s and goodne&s;s of her parents, the ta&s;te and &s;implicity of her former life&mdash;all ro&s;e to her fancy, and formed a picture, &s;o &s;weet and glowing, &s;o &s;trikingly con|tra&s;ted with the &s;cenes, the characters and the dangers, which now &s;urrounded her&mdash;that her mind could not bear to pau&s;e upon the retro&s;pect, and &s;hrunk at the acutene&s;s of its own &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Her &s;ighs were deep and convul&s;ed; &s;he could no longer li&s;ten to the &s;train, that had &s;o often charmed her to tranquillity, and &s;he withdrew from the ca&s;ement to a remote part of the chamber. But &s;he was not yet beyond the reach of the mu&s;ic; &s;he heard the mea&s;ure change, and the &s;ucceeding air called her again to the window, for &s;he immediately recollected it to be the &s;ame &s;he had formerly heard in the fi&s;hing hou&s;e in Ga&s;cony. A&s;|&s;i&s;ted, perhaps, by the my&s;tery, which had then accompanied this &s;train, it had made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on her memory, that &s;he had never &s;ince entirely forgotten it; and the manner, in which it was now &s;ung, convinced her, however unaccount|able the circum&s;tance appeared, that this was the &s;ame voice &s;he had then heard. Surpri&s;e &s;oon yielded to other emotions; a thought darted, like lightning, upon her mind, which di&s;covered a train of hopes, that revived all her &s;pirits. Yet the&s;e hopes were &s;o new, &s;o unexpected, &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that &s;he did not dare to tru&s;t, though &s;he could not re&s;olve to di&s;courage them. She &s;at down by the ca&s;ement, breathle&s;s, and overcome with the alternate emotions of hope and fear; then ro&s;e again, leaned from the window, that &s;he might catch a nearer &s;ound, li&s;tened,

now doubting and then believing, &s;oftly exclaimed the name of Valancourt, and then &s;unk again into the chair. Yes, it was po&s;&s;ible, that Valancourt was near her, and &s;he recollected cir|cum&s;tances, which induced her to believe it was his voice &s;he had ju&s;t heard. She remembered he had more than once &s;aid that the fi&s;hing hou&s;e, where &s;he had formerly li&s;tened to his voice and air, and where &s;he had &s;een pencilled &s;onnets, addre&s;&s;ed to her&s;elf, had been his favourite haun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, before he had been made known to her; there, too, &s;he had her&s;elf unexpectedly met him. It appeared, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, more than probable, that he was the mu&s;ician, who had formerly charmed her attention, and the author of the lines, which had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch tender ad|miration;&mdash;who el&s;e, indeed could it be? She was unable at that time to form a conjecture, as to the writer, but, &s;ince her acquaintance with Valancourt, whenever he had mentioned the fi&s;hing hou&s;e to have been known to him, &s;he had not &s;crupled to believe that he was the author of the &s;onnets.</P>
<P>As the&s;e con&s;iderations pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, joy, fear and tenderne&s;s contended at her heart; &s;he leaned again from the ca&s;ement to catch the &s;ounds, which might confirm, or de&s;troy her hope, though &s;he did not recollect to have ever heard him &s;ing; but the voice, and the in&s;trument, now cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>She con&s;idered for a moment whether &s;he &s;hould venture to &s;peak: then, not choo&s;ing, le&s;t it &s;hould be he, to mention his name, and yet too much intere&s;ted to neglect the opportunity of inquiring, &s;he called from the ca&s;ement, "Is that &s;ong from Ga&s;cony?" Her anxious attention was not cheered by any reply; every thing remained &s;ilent. Her impatience increa&s;ing with her fears, &s;he repeated the que&s;tion; but &s;till no &s;ound was heard, except the &s;ighings of the wind among the battlements above; and &s;he endeavoured to con&s;ole her&s;elf with a belief, that the &s;tranger, whoever he was, had retired, before &s;he had &s;poken, beyond the reach of her voice, which it appeared certain, had Valancourt heard and recognized, he would in&s;tantly have repli|ed to. Pre&s;ently, however, &s;he con&s;idered, that a motive of pru|dence and not an accidental removal might occa&s;ion his &s;ilence; but the &s;urmi&s;e, that led to this reflection, &s;uddenly changed her hope and joy to terror and grief; for, if Valancourt were in the ca&s;tle, it was too probable, that he was here a pri&s;oner, taken with &s;ome of his countrymen, many of whom were at that time engaged in the wars of Italy, or intercepted in &s;ome attempt to reach her. Had he even recollected Emily's voice, he would have feared, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, to reply to it, in the pre&s;ence of the men, who guarded his pri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="029378_0199_0FE083F0A2DAFD28">
What &s;o lately &s;he had eagerly hoped &s;he now believed &s;he dreaded;&mdash;dreaded to know that Valancourt was near her; and, while &s;he was anxious to be relieved from her apprehen&s;ion for his &s;afety, &s;he &s;till was uncon&s;cious, that a hope of &s;oon &s;eeing him, &s;truggled with the fear.</P>
<P>She remained li&s;tening at the ca&s;ement, till the air began to fre&s;hen, and one high mountain in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to glimmer with the morning; when, wearied with anxiety, &s;he retired to her couch, where &s;he found it utterly impo&s;&s;ible to &s;leep, for joy, tenderne&s;s, doubt and apprehen&s;ion, di&s;tracted her during the whole night. Now &s;he ro&s;e from the couch, and opened the ca&s;ement to li&s;ten; then &s;he would pace the room with impatient &s;teps, and, at length, return with de&s;pondence to her pillow. Never did hours appear to move &s;o heavily, as tho&s;e of this anxious night; after which &s;he hoped that Annette might appear, and conclude her pre&s;ent &s;tate of torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>

<P>IN the morning, Emily was relieved from her fears for An|nette, who came at an early hour.</P>
<P>"Here were fine doings in the ca&s;tle, la&s;t night, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;oon as &s;he entered the room,&mdash;"fine doings, indeed! Was you not frightened, ma'am&s;elle, at not &s;eeing me?"</P>

<P>"Aye, I &s;aid &s;o, I told him &s;o; but it would not do. It was not my fault, indeed, ma'am&s;elle, for I could not get out. The rogue Ludovico locked me up again."</P>
<P>"Locked you up!" &s;aid Emily, with di&s;plea&s;ure, "Why do you permit Ludovico to lock you up?"</P>
<P>"Holy Saints!" exclaimed Annette," how can I help it! If he will lock the door, ma'am&s;elle, and take away the key, how

am I to get out, unle&s;s I jump through the window?

But you know, I dare &s;ay, ma'am, what a hurly burly the ca&s;tle was in, la&s;t night; you mu&s;t have heard &s;ome of the uproar."</P>
<P>"What, were they di&s;puting, then?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"No, ma'am&s;elle, not fighting, but almo&s;t as good, for I be|lieve there was not one of the Signors &s;ober; and what is more, not one of tho&s;e fine ladies &s;ober, either. I thought, when I &s;aw them fir&s;t, that all tho&s;e fine &s;ilks and fine veils,&mdash;why, ma'am&s;elle, their veils were worked with &s;ilver! and fine trim|mings&mdash;boded no good&mdash;I gue&s;&s;ed what they were!"</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, "what will become of me!"</P>
<P>"Ave, ma'am, Ludovico &s;aid much the &s;ame thing of me. Good God! &s;aid he, Annette, what is to become of you, if you are to go running about the ca&s;tle among all the&s;e drunken Signors?"</P>
<P>"O! &s;ays I, for that matter I only want to go to my young lady's chamber, and I have only to go, you know, along the vaulted pa&s;&s;age and acro&s;s the great hall and up the marble &s;tair|ca&s;e and along the north gallery and through the we&s;t wing of the ca&s;tle, and I am in the corridor in a minute." "Are you &s;o? &s;ays he, and what is to become of you, if you meet any of tho&s;e noble cavaliers in the way?" "Well, &s;ays I, if you think there is danger, then, go with me, and guard me; I am never afraid when you are by." "What! &s;ays he, when I am &s;carcely recovered of one wound, &s;hall I put my&s;elf in the way of getting another? for if any of the cavaliers meet you, they will fall a fighting with me directly. No, no, &s;ays he, I will cut the way &s;horter, than through the vaulted pa&s;&s;age and up the marble &s;tairca&s;e and along the north gallery and through the we&s;t wing of the ca&s;tle, for you &s;hall &s;tay here, Annette; you &s;hall not go out of this room, to night." "So, with that I &s;ays"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well, well," &s;aid Emily, impatiently, and anxious to in|quire on another &s;ubject,&mdash;"&s;o he locked you up?"</P>
<P>"Yes, he did indeed, ma'am&s;elle, notwith&s;tanding all I could &s;ay to the contrary; and Catarina and I and he &s;taid there all night. And in a few minutes after I was not &s;o vexed, for there came Signor Verezzi roaring along the pa&s;&s;age, like a mad bull, and he mi&s;took Ludovico's hall, for old Carlo's; &s;o he tried to bur&s;t open the door, and called out for more wine, for that he had drunk all the fla&s;ks dry, and was dying of thir&s;t.

So we were all as &s;till as night, that he might &s;uppo&s;e there was nobody in the room; but the Signor was as cunning as the be&s;t of us, and kept calling out at the door, "Come forth, my ancient hero!" &s;aid he, "here is no enemy at the gate, that you need hide your&s;elf: come forth, my valorous Signor Stew|ard!" Ju&s;t then old Carlo opened his door, and he came with a fla&s;k in his hand; for, as &s;oon as the Signor &s;aw him, he was as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame as could be, and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a piece of meat in his ba&s;ket.

<P>"I have &s;ome que&s;tions to a&s;k you on another &s;ubject," inter|rupted Emily, quite wearied by this &s;tory. "Do you know whether there are any pri&s;oners in the ca&s;tle, and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice?"</P>
<P>"I was not in the way, ma'am&s;elle," replied Annette, "when the fir&s;t party came in from the mountains, and the la&s;t party is not come back yet, &s;o I don't know, whether there are any pri|&s;oners; but it is expected back to-night, or to-morrow, and I &s;hall know then, perhaps."</P>
<P>Emily inquired if &s;he had ever heard the &s;ervants talk of pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>"Ah ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid Annette archly, "now I dare &s;ay you are thinking of Mon&s;ieur Valancourt, and that he may have come among the armies, which, they &s;ay, are come from our country, to fight again&s;t this &s;tate, and that he has met with &s;ome of <HI>our</HI> people, and is taken captive. O Lord! how glad I &s;hould be, if it was &s;o!"</P>
<P>"Would you, indeed, be glad?" &s;aid Emily, in a tone of mournful reproach.</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure I &s;hould, ma'am," replied Annette, "and would not you be glad too, to &s;ee Signor Valancourt? I don't know any chevalier I like better, I have a very great regard for the Signor, truly."</P>
<P>"Your regard for him cannot be doubted," &s;aid Emily, "&s;ince you wi&s;h to &s;ee him a pri&s;oner."</P>
<P>"Why no, ma'am&s;elle, not a pri&s;oner either; but one mu&s;t be glad to &s;ee him, you know. And it was only the other night I dreamt&mdash;I dreamt I &s;aw him drive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">to the ca&s;tle yard all in a coach and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix, and dre&s;&s;ed out with a laced coat and a &s;word, like a lord as he is."</P>
<P>Emily could not forbear &s;miling at Annette's ideas of Valan|court, and repeated her inquiry, whether &s;he had heard the &s;er|vants talk pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="029378_0201_0FE08403EF8A97E0">
"No, ma'am&s;elle," replied &s;he, "never; and lately they have done nothing but talk of the apparition, that has been walking about of a night on the ramparts, and that frightened the &s;enti|nels into &s;its. It came among them like a fla&s;h of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, they &s;ay, and they all fell down in a row, till they came to them&s;elves again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and then it was gone, and nothing to be &s;een but the old ca&s;tle walls; &s;o they helped one another up again as fa&s;t as they could. You would not believe ma'am&s;elle though I &s;hew|ed you the very cannon, where it u&s;ed to appear."</P>
<P>"And are you, indeed, &s;o &s;imple, Annette," &s;aid Emily, &s;mil|ing at this curious exaggeration of the circum&s;tance &s;he had wit|ne&s;&s;ed, "as to credit the&s;e &s;tories?"</P>
<P>"Credit them, ma'am&s;elle! why all the world could not per|&s;uade me out of them. Roberto and Seba&s;tian and half a dozen more of them went into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its! To be &s;ure, there was no occa&s;ion for that; I &s;aid, my&s;elf, there was no need of that, for, &s;ays I, when the enemy comes, what a pretty figure they will cut, if they are to fall down in fits, all of a row! The enemy won't be &s;o civil, perhaps, as to walk off, like the gho&s;t, and leave them to help one another up, but will fall to, cutting and &s;la&s;hing, till he makes tham all ri&s;e up dead men. No, no, &s;ays I, there is rea&s;on in all things: though I might have fallen down in a fit, that was no rule for them, being, becau&s;e it is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine to look gruff, and fight battles."</P>
<P>Emily endeavoured to correct the &s;uper&s;titious weakne&s;s of Annette, though &s;he could not entirely &s;ubdue her own; to which the latter only replied, "Nay, ma'am&s;elle, you will be|lieve nothing; you are almo&s;t as bad as the Signor him&s;elf, who was in a great pa&s;&s;ion when they told him of what had happened, and &s;wore that the fir&s;t man who repeated &s;uch non&s;en&s;e &s;hould be thrown into the dungeon under the ea&s;t turret. This was a hard puni&s;hment too, for only talking non&s;en&s;e, as he called it, but I dare &s;ay he had other rea&s;ons for calling it &s;o, than you have, ma'am."</P>
<P>Emily looked di&s;plea&s;ed, and made no reply. As &s;he mu&s;ed upon the recollected appearance, which had lately &s;o much alarm|ed her, and con&s;idered the circum&s;tances of the figure having &s;tationed it&s;elf oppo&s;ite to her ca&s;ement, &s;he was for a moment inclined to believe it was Valancourt, whom &s;he had &s;een. Yet, if it was he, why did he not &s;peak to her when he had the op|portunity of doing &s;o&mdash;and if he was a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle, and he could be here in no other character, how could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e obtain the means of walking abroad on the rampart? Thus &s;he was utterly
<PB N="175" REF="029378_0201_0FE08403EF8A97E0">
unable to decide, whether the mu&s;ician and the form &s;he had ob|&s;erved, were the &s;ame, or if they were, whether this was Va|lancourt. She, however, de&s;ired that Annette would endeavour to learn whether any pri&s;oners were in the ca&s;tle, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> al&s;o their names.</P>
<P>"O dear, ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid Annette, "I forgot to tell you what you bade me a&s;k about the ladies, as they call them&s;elves, who are lately come to Udolpho. Why that Signora Livona, that the Signor brought to &s;ee my late lady at Venice, is his mi&s;tre&s;s now, and was little better then, I dare &s;ay. And Ludovico &s;ays, but pray be &s;ecret, ma'am, that his <HI>Excellenza</HI> introduced her only to impo&s;e upon the world, that had begun to make free with her character. So when people &s;aw my lady notice her, they thought what they had heard mu&s;t be &s;candal. The other two are the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Signor Verezzi and Signor Bertolini; and Signor Montoni invited them all to the ca&s;tle; and &s;o, ye&s;ter|day he gave a great entertainment; and there they were, all drinking Tu&s;cany wine and all &s;orts, and laughing and &s;inging, till they made the ca&s;tle ring again. But I thought they were di&s;mal &s;ounds, &s;o &s;oon after my poor lady's death too; and they brought to my mind what &s;he would have thought, if &s;he had heard them&mdash;but &s;he cannot hear them now, poor &s;oul! &s;aid I."</P>
<P>Emily turned away to conceal her emotion, and then de&s;ired Annette to go, and make inquiry, concerning the pri&s;oners, that might be in the ca&s;tle, but conjured her to do it with caution, and on no account to mention her name, or that of Mon&s;ieur Valancourt.</P>
<P>"Now I think of it ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "I do be|lieve there are pri&s;oners, for I overheard one of the Signor's men ye&s;terday, in the &s;ervants' hall, talking &s;omething about ran&s;oms, and &s;aying what a fine thing it was for his <HI>Excellenza</HI> to catch up men, and they were as good booty as any other, becau&s;e of the ran&s;oms. And the other man was grumbling, and &s;aying it was fine enough for the Signor, but none &s;o fine for his &s;oldiers, becau&s;e, &s;aid he, we dont' go &s;hares there."</P>
<P>This information heightened Emily's impatience to know more, and Annette immediately departed on her inquiry.</P>
<P>The late re&s;olution of Emily to re&s;ign her e&s;tates to Montoni, now gave way to new con&s;iderations; the po&s;&s;ibility, that Va|lancourt was near her, revived her fortitude, and &s;he determined to brave the threatened vengeance, at lea&s;t, till &s;he could be a&s;|&s;ured whether he was really in the ca&s;tle. She was in this tem|per of mind when &s;he received a me&s;&s;age from Montoni, requir|ing
<PB N="176" REF="029378_0202_0FE08408A68BEB80">
her attendance in the cedar parlour, which &s;he obeyed with trembling, and, on her way thither, endeavoured to animate her fortitude with the idea of Valancourt.</P>
<P>Montoni was alone. "I &s;ent for you," &s;aid he, "to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mi&s;taken a&s;&s;ertions concerning the Languedoc e&s;tates. I will conde&s;cend to advi&s;e, where I may command.&mdash;If you are really deluded by an opin|ion, that you have any right to the&s;e e&s;tates, at lea&s;t, do not per|&s;i&s;t in the error&mdash;an error, which you may perceive, too late, has been fatal to you. Dare my re&s;entment no further, but &s;ign the papers."</P>
<P>"If I have no right in the&s;e e&s;tates, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, "of what &s;ervice can it be to you, that I &s;hould &s;ign any papers, concern|ing them? If the lands are yours by law, you certainly may po&s;&s;e&s;s them, without my interference, or my con&s;ent."</P>
<P>"I will have no more argument," &s;aid Montoni, with a look that made her tremble. "What had I but trouble to expect, when I conde&s;cended to rea&s;on with a baby! But I will be tri|fled with no longer: let the recollection of your aunt's &s;ufferings in con&s;equence of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ully and ob&s;tinacy, teach you a le&s;&s;on.&mdash;Sign the papers."</P>
<P>Emily's re&s;olution was for a moment awed:&mdash;&s;he &s;hrunk at the recollections he revived, and from the vengeance he threaten|ed; but then, the image of Valancourt, who &s;o long had loved her, and who was now, perhaps &s;o near her, came to her heart, and, together with the &s;tronge&s;t feelings of indignation, with which &s;he had always from her infancy, regarded an act of in|ju&s;tice, in&s;pired her with a noble, though imprudent, courage.</P>
<P>"Sign the papers," &s;aid Montoni, more impatiently than before.</P>
<P>"Never &s;ir," replied Emily; "that reque&s;t would have prov|ed to me the inju&s;tice of your claim, had I even been ignorant of my right."</P>
<P>Montoni turned pale with anger, while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almo&s;t repent the boldne&s;s of her &s;peech.</P>
<P>"Then all my vengeance falls upon you," he exclaimed, with an horrible oath. "And think not it &s;hall be delayed. Neither the e&s;tates in Languedoc, or Ga&s;cony, &s;hall be yours; you have dared to que&s;tion my right,&mdash;now dare to que&s;tion my power. I have a puni&s;hment which you think not of; it is terrible! This night&mdash;this very night"&mdash;</P>
<P>"This night!" repeated another voice.</P>
<P>Montoni pau&s;ed, and turned half round, but, &s;eeming to recol|lect him&s;elf he proceeded in a lower tone.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="029378_0202_0FE08408A68BEB80">
"You have lately &s;een one terrible example of ob&s;tinacy and folly; yet this, it appears, has not been &s;ufficient to deter you. I could tell you of others&mdash;I could make you tremble at the bare recital."</P>
<P>He was interrupted by a groan, which &s;eemed to ri&s;e from un|derneath the chamber they were in; and, as he threw a glance round it, impatience and rage fla&s;hed from his eyes, yet &s;ome|thing like a &s;hade of fear pa&s;&s;ed over his countenance. Emily &s;at down in a chair near the door, for the various emotions &s;he had &s;uffered, now almo&s;t overcame her; but Montoni pau&s;ed &s;carcely an in&s;tant, and, commanding his features, re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e in a lower, yet &s;terner voice.</P>
<P>"I &s;ay, I could give you other in&s;tances of my power and of my character, which it &s;eems you do not under&s;tand, or you would not defy me. I could tell you, that, when once my re&s;o|lution is taken&mdash;but I am talking to a baby. Let me, however, repeat, that terrible as are the example I could recite, the recital could not now benefit you; for, though your repentance would put an immediate end to oppo&s;ition, it would not now appea&s;e my indignation.&mdash;I will have vengeance as well as ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>Another groan filled the pau&s;e which Montoni made.</P>
<P>"Leave the room in&s;tantly!" &s;aid he, &s;eeming not to notice this &s;trange occurrence. Without power to implore his pity, &s;he ro&s;e to go, but found that &s;he could not &s;upport her&s;elf; awe and terror overcame her, and &s;he &s;unk again into the chair.</P>
<P>"Quit my pre&s;ence!" cried Montoni. "This affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has ju&s;t dared to brave my in|dignation."</P>
<P>"Did you hear nothing Signor?" &s;aid Emily, trembling, and &s;till unable to leave the room.</P>
<P>"I heard my own voice," rejoined Montoni, &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"And nothing el&s;e?" &s;aid Emily, &s;peaking with difficulty.&mdash;"There again! Do you hear nothing now?"</P>
<P>"Obey my order," repeated Montoni. "And for the&s;e fool's tricks&mdash;I will &s;oon di&s;cover by whom they are practi&s;ed."</P>
<P>Emily again ro&s;e, and exerted her&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to leave the room, while Montoni followed her; but, in&s;tead of calling aloud to his &s;ervants to &s;earch the chamber, as he had formerly done on a &s;imilar occurrence, pa&s;&s;ed to the ramparts.</P>
<P>As, in her way to the corridor, &s;he re&s;ted for a moment at an open ca&s;ement, Emily &s;aw a party of Montoni's troops winding down a di&s;tant mountain, whom &s;he noticed no further, than as
<PB N="178" REF="029378_0203_0FE0841564CCE218">
they brought to her mind the wretched pri&s;oners they were, perhaps, bringing to the ca&s;tle. At length, having reached her apartment, &s;he threw her&s;elf upon a couch, overcome with the new horrors of her &s;ituation. Her thoughts lo&s;t in tumult and perplexity, &s;he could neither repent of, or approve, her late conduct; &s;he could only remember, that &s;he was in the power of a man, who had no principle of action&mdash;but his will; and the a&s;toni&s;hment and terrors of &s;uper&s;tition, which had, for a moment, &s;o &s;trongly a&s;&s;ailed her, now yielded to tho&s;e of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>She was, at length, rou&s;ed from the reverie, which engaged her, by a confu&s;ion of di&s;tant voices, and a clattering of hoofs, that &s;eemed to come, on the wind, from the courts. A &s;udden hope, that &s;ome good was approaching, &s;eized her mind, till &s;he remembered the troops &s;he had ob&s;erved from the ca&s;ement, and concluded this to be the party, which Annette had &s;aid were expected at Udolpho.</P>
<P>Soon after, &s;he heard voices faintly from the halls, and the noi&s;e of hor&s;es' feet &s;unk away in the wind; &s;ilence en&s;ued. Emily li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly for Annette's &s;tep in the corridor, but a pau&s;e of total &s;tillne&s;s continued, till again the ca&s;tle &s;eemed to be all tumult and confu&s;ion. She heard the echoes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> foot&s;teps, pa&s;&s;ing to and fro in the halls and avenues below, and then bu&s;y tongues were loud on the rampart. Having hurried to her ca&s;ement, &s;he perceived Montoni, with &s;ome of his offi|cers, leaning on the walls, and pointing from them; while &s;eve|ral &s;oldiers were employed at the further end of the rampart about &s;ome cannon; and &s;he continued to ob&s;erve them, care|le&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ing time.</P>
<P>Annette at length appeared, but brought no intelligence of Valancourt, "For, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, "all the people pre|tend to kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nothing about any pri&s;oners. But here is a fine piece of bu&s;ine&s;s! The re&s;t of the party are ju&s;t arrived, ma'am; they came &s;campering in, as if they would have broken their necks; one &s;carcely knew whether the man, or his hor&s;e would get within the gates fir&s;t. And they have brought word&mdash;and &s;uch news! they have brought word, that a party of the enemy, as they call them, are coming towards the ca&s;tle; &s;o we &s;hall have all the officers of ju&s;tice, I &s;uppo&s;e, be&s;ieging it! all tho&s;e terrible looking fellows one u&s;ed to &s;ee at Venice."</P>
<P>"Thank God!" exclaimed Emily, fervently, "there is yet a hope left for me, then!"</P>
<P>"What mean you, ma'am&s;elle? Do you wi&s;h to fall into the hands of tho&s;e &s;ad looking men! Why I u&s;ed to &s;hudder as I
<PB N="179" REF="029378_0203_0FE0841564CCE218">
pa&s;&s;ed them, and &s;hould have gue&s;&s;ed what they were, if Ludov|ico had not told me."</P>
<P>"We cannot be in wor&s;e hands than at pre&s;ent," replied Em|ily, unguardedly; "but what rea&s;on have you to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e are officers of ju&s;tice?"</P>
<P>"Why <HI>our</HI> people, ma'am, are all in &s;uch a fright, and a fu&s;s; and I don't know any thing but the fear of ju&s;tice, that could make them &s;o. I u&s;ed to think nothing on earth could flu&s;ter them, unle&s;s, indeed, it was a gho&s;t, or &s;o; but now, &s;ome of them are for hiding down in the vaults under the ca&s;tle; but you mu&s;t not tell the Signor this, ma'am&s;elle, and I overheard two of them talking&mdash;Holy Mother! what makes you look &s;o &s;ad, ma'am&s;elle? You don't hear what I &s;ay!"</P>
<P>"Yes, I do, Annette! pray proceed."</P>
<P>"Well, ma'am&s;elle, all the ca&s;tle is in &s;uch hurly burly.&mdash;Some of the men are loading the cannon, and &s;ome are examin|ing the great gates, and the walls all round, and are hammering and patching up, ju&s;t as if all tho&s;e repairs had never been made, that were &s;o long about. But what is to become of me and you, ma'am&s;elle, and Ludovico? O! when I hear the &s;ound of the cannon, I &s;hall die with fright. If I could but catch the great gate open for one minute, I would be even with it for &s;hutting me within the&s;e walls &s;o long!&mdash;it &s;hould never &s;ee me again."</P>
<P>Emily caught the latter words of Annette. "O! if you could find it open, but for one moment!" &s;he exclaimed, "my peace might yet be &s;aved!" The heavy groan &s;he uttered, and the wildne&s;s of her look, terrified Annette, &s;till more than her words; who entreated Emily to explain the meaning of them, to whom it &s;uddenly occurred, that Ludovico might be of &s;ome &s;ervice, if there &s;hould be a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape, and who repeat|ed the &s;ub&s;tance of what had pa&s;&s;ed between Montoni and her&s;elf, but conjured her to mention this to no per&s;on except to Ludovico. "It may, perhaps, be in his power," &s;he added, "to effect our e&s;cape. Go to him, Annette, tell him what I have to apprehend, and what I have already &s;uffered; but entreat him to be &s;ecret, and to lo&s;e no time in attempting to relea&s;e us. If he is willing to undertake this he &s;hall be amply rewarded. I cannot &s;peak with him my&s;elf, for we might be ob&s;erved, and then effectual care would be taken to prevent our flight. But be quick, An|nette, and, above all be di&s;creet&mdash;I will await your return in this apartment."</P>
<P>The girl, who&s;e hone&s;t heart had been much affected by the recital, was now as eager to obey, as Emily was to employ her, and &s;he immediately quitted the room.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="029378_0204_0FE0841A347DB6B0">
Emily's &s;urpri&s;e increa&s;ed, as &s;he reflected upon Annette's in|telligence. "Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, "what can the officers of ju&s;tice do again&s;t an armed ca&s;tle? the&s;e cannot be &s;uch." Upon further con&s;ideration, however, &s;he concluded, that, Montoni's bands having plundered the country round, the inhabitants had taken arms, and were coming with the officers of police and a party of &s;oldiers, to force their way into the ca&s;tle. "But they know not," thought &s;he, "its &s;trength, or the armed numbers within it. Alas! except from flight, I have nothing to hope!"</P>
<P>Montoni, though not preci&s;ely what Emily apprehended him to be&mdash;a captain of banditti&mdash;had employed his troops in enter|pri&s;es not le&s;s daring, or le&s;s atrocious, than &s;uch a character would have undertaken. They had not only pillaged, when|ever opportunity offered, the helple&s;s traveller, but had attacked, and plundered the villas of &s;everal per&s;ons, which, being &s;ituated among the &s;olitary rece&s;&s;es of the mountains, were totally unpre|pared for re&s;i&s;tance. In the&s;e expeditions the commanders of the party did not appear, and the men, partly di&s;gui&s;ed, had &s;ome|times been mi&s;taken for common robbers, and, at others, for bands of the foreign enemy, who, at that period, invaded the country. But, though they had already pillaged &s;everal man&s;ions, and brought home con&s;iderable trea&s;ures, they had ventured to ap|proach only one ca&s;tle, in the attack of which they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by other troops of their own order; from this, however, they were vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed, and pur&s;ued by &s;ome of the foreign enemy, who were in league with the be&s;ieged. Montoni's troops fled precipitately towards Udolpho, but were &s;o clo&s;ely tracked over the mountains, that, when they reached one of the heights in the neighbourhood of the ca&s;tle, and looked back upon the road, they perceived the enemy winding among the cliffs below, and at not more than a league di&s;tant. Upon this di&s;covery, they ha&s;tened forward with increa&s;ed &s;peed, to prepare Montoni for the enemy; and it was their arrival, which had thrown the ca&s;|tle into &s;uch confu&s;ion and tumult.</P>
<P>As Emily awaited anxiou&s;ly &s;ome information from below, &s;he now &s;aw from her ca&s;ements a body of troops pour over the neighbouring heights; and, though Annette had been gone a a very &s;hort time, and had a difficult and dangerous bu&s;ine&s;s to accompli&s;h, her impatience for intelligence became painful: &s;he li&s;tened; opened her door; and often went out upon the corri|dor to meet her.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he heard a foot&s;tep approach her chamber; and, on opening the door, &s;aw, not Annette, but old Carlo! New
<PB N="181" REF="029378_0204_0FE0841A347DB6B0">
fears ru&s;hed upon her mind. He &s;aid he came from the Sig|nor, who had ordered him to inform her, that &s;he mu&s;t be ready to depart from Udolpho immediately, for that the ca&s;tle was about to be be&s;ieged; and that mules were preparing to convey her, with her guides, to a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>"Of &s;afety!" exclaimed Emily, thoughtle&s;sly; "has, then, the Signor &s;o much con&s;ideration for me?"</P>
<P>Carlo looked upon the ground, and made no reply. A thou|&s;and oppo&s;ite emotions agitated Emily, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, as &s;he li&s;ten|ed to old Carlo; tho&s;e of joy, grief, di&s;tru&s;t and apprehen&s;ion, appeared, and vani&s;hed from her mind, with the quickne&s;s of lightning. One moment, it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible, that Montoni could take this mea&s;ure merely for her pre&s;ervation; and &s;o ve|ry &s;trange was his &s;ending her from the ca&s;tle at all, that &s;he could attribute it only to the de&s;ign of carrying into execution the new &s;cheme of vengeance, with which he had menaced her. In the next in&s;tant, it appeared &s;o de&s;irable to quit the ca&s;tle, un|der any circum&s;tances, that &s;he could not but rejoice in the pro&s;|pect, believing that change mu&s;t be for the better, till &s;he re|membered the probability of Valancourt being detained in it, when &s;orrow and regret u&s;urped her mind, and &s;he wi&s;hed, much more fervently than &s;he had yet done, that it might not be his voice which &s;he had heard.</P>
<P>Carlo having reminded her, that &s;he had no time to lo&s;e, for that the enemy were within &s;ight of the ca&s;tle, Emily entreated him to inform her whither &s;he was to go; and, after &s;ome he&s;itation, he &s;aid he had received no orders to tell; but, on her repeating the que&s;tion, replied, that he believed &s;he was to be carried into Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>"To Tu&s;cany!" exclaimed Emily&mdash;"and why thither?"</P>
<P>Carlo an&s;wered, that he knew nothing further, than that &s;he was to be lodged in a cottage on the borders of Tu&s;cany, at the feet of the Apennines&mdash;"Not a day's journey di&s;tant," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Emily now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him; and, with trembling hands, pre|pared the &s;mall package, that &s;he meant to take with her; while &s;he was employed about which Annette returned.</P>
<P>"O ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid &s;he, "nothing can be done! Ludovico &s;ays the new porter is more watchful even than Barnardine was, and we might as well throw our&s;elves in the way of a dragon, as in his. Ludovico is almo&s;t as broken hearted as you are, ma'am, on my account, he &s;ays, and I am &s;ure I &s;hall never live to hear the cannon fire twice!"</P>
<P>She now began to weep, but revived upon hearing of what had ju&s;t occurred, and entreated Emily to take her with her.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="029378_0205_0FE08425950247D8">
"That I will do mo&s;t willingly," replied Emily, "if Signo Montoni permits it;" to which Annette made no reply, but ran out of the room, and immediately &s;ought Montoni, who was on the terrace, &s;urrounded by his officers, where &s;he began her pe|tition. He &s;harply bade her go into the ca&s;tle, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed her reque&s;t. Annette, however, not only pleaded for her&s;elf, but for Ludovico; and Montoni had ordered &s;ome of his men to take her from his pre&s;ence, before &s;he would retire.</P>
<P>In an agony of di&s;appointment, &s;he returned to Emily, who foreboded little good towards her&s;elf, from this refu&s;al to Annette, and who, &s;oon after, received a &s;ummons to repair to the great court, where the mules, with their guides, were in waiting.&mdash;Emily here tried in vain to &s;ooth the weeping Annette, who per|&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying, that &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee her dear young lady again; a fear, which her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ecretly thought too well ju&s;ti|fied, but which &s;he endeavoured to re&s;train, while, with ap|parent compo&s;ure, &s;he bade this affectionate &s;ervant farewel.&mdash;Annette, however, followed to the courts, which were now thronged with people, bu&s;y in preparation for the enemy; and, having &s;een her mount her mule and depart, with her attendants, through the portal, turned into the ca&s;tle and wept again.</P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile, as &s;he looked back upon the gloomy courts of the ca&s;tle, no longer &s;ilent as when &s;he had fir&s;t entered them, but re&s;ounding with the noi&s;e of preparation for their defence, as well as crowded with &s;oldiers and workmen, hurrying to and fro; and, when &s;he pa&s;&s;ed once more under the huge portcullis, which had formerly &s;truck her with terror and di&s;may; and, looking round, &s;aw no walls to confine her &s;teps&mdash;felt, in &s;pite of anticipation, the &s;udden joy of a pri&s;oner, who unexpectedly finds him&s;elf at liberty. This emotion would not &s;uffer her now to look impartially on the dangers that awaited her without; on mountains infe&s;ted by ho&s;tile parties, who &s;eized every op|portunity for plunder; and on a journey commenced under the guidance of men, who&s;e countenances certainly did not &s;peak fa|vourably of their di&s;po&s;itions. In the pre&s;ent moments, &s;he could only rejoice, that &s;he was liberated from tho&s;e walls, which &s;he had entered with &s;uch di&s;mal forebodings; and, remembering the &s;uper&s;titious pre&s;entiment, which had then &s;eized her, &s;he could now &s;mile at the impre&s;&s;ion it had made upon her mind.</P>
<P>As &s;he gazed, with the&s;e emotions, upon the turrets of the ca&s;tle, ri&s;ing high over the woods, among which &s;he wound, the &s;tranger, whom &s;he believed to be confined there, returned to her remembrance, and anxiety and apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t he &s;hould be
<PB N="183" REF="029378_0205_0FE08425950247D8">
Valancourt, again pa&s;&s;ed like a cloud upon her joy. She recol|lected every circum&s;tance, concerning this unknown per&s;on, &s;ince the night, when &s;he had fir&s;t heard him play the &s;ong of her na|tive province;&mdash;circum&s;tances, which &s;he had &s;o often recollect|ed, and compared before, without extracting from them any thing like conviction, and which &s;till only prompted her to be|lieve, that Valancourt was a pri&s;oner at Udolpho. It was po&s;&s;i|ble, however, that the men, who were her conductors, might af|ford her information, on this &s;ubject; but, fearing to que&s;tion them immediately, le&s;t they &s;hould be unwilling to di&s;cover any circum&s;tance to her in the pre&s;ence of each other, &s;he watched for an opportunity of &s;peaking with them &s;eparately.</P>
<P>Soon after, a trumpet echoed faintly from a di&s;tance; the guides &s;topped, and looked toward the quarter whence it came, but the thick woods, which &s;urrounded them, excluding all view of the country beyond, one of the men rod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> on to the point of an eminence, that afforded a more exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, to ob|&s;erve how near the enemy, who&s;e trumpet he gue&s;&s;ed this to be, were advanced; the other, meanwhile, remained with Emily, and to him &s;he put &s;ome que&s;tions, concerning the &s;tranger at Udolpho. Ugo, for this was his name, &s;aid, that there were &s;everal pri&s;oners in the ca&s;tle, but he neither recollected their per&s;ons, or the preci&s;e time of their arrival, and could therefore give her no information. There was a &s;urline&s;s in his manner, as he &s;poke, that made it probable he would not have &s;atisfied her inquiries, even if he could have done &s;o.</P>
<P>Having a&s;ked him what pri&s;oners had been taken, about the time, as nearly as &s;he could remember, when &s;he had fir&s;t heard the mu&s;ic, "All that week," &s;aid, Ugo, 'I was out with a party, upon the mountains, and knew nothing of what was do|ing at the ca&s;tle. We had enough upon our hands, we had warm work of it.'</P>
<P>Bertrand, the other man, being now returned, Emily inquired no further, and when he had related to his companion, what he had &s;een, they travelled on in deep &s;ilence; while Emily often caught, between the opening woods, partial glimp&s;es of the ca&s;|tle above&mdash;the we&s;t towers, who&s;e battlements were now crowd|ed with archers, and the ramparts below, where &s;oldiers were &s;een hurrying along, or bu&s;y upon the walls, preparing the cannon.</P>
<P>Having emerged from the woods, they wound along the val|ley in an oppo&s;ite direction to that, from whence the enemy were approaching. Emily had now a full view of Udolpho, with its gray walls, towers and terraces, high over topping the precipices
<PB N="184" REF="029378_0206_0FE0842A2754C190">
and the dark woods, and glittering partially with the arms of the <HI>condottieri,</HI> as the &s;un's rays, &s;treaming through an autumnal cloud, glanced upon a part of the edifice, who&s;e remaining fea|tures &s;tood in darkened maje&s;ty. She continued to gaze, through her tears, upon walls that, perhaps, confined Valancourt, and which now, as the cloud floated away, were lighted up with &s;ud|den &s;plendour, and then, as &s;uddenly were &s;hrouded in gloom; while the pa&s;&s;ing gleam fell on the wood tops below, and height|ened the fir&s;t tints of autumn, that had begun to &s;teal upon the foliage. The winding mountains, at length, &s;hut Udolpho from her view, and &s;he turned, with mournful reluctance, to other ob|jects. The melancholy &s;ighing of the wind among the pines, that waved high over the &s;teeps, and the di&s;tant thunder of a tor|rent a&s;&s;i&s;ted her mu&s;ings, and con&s;pired with the wild &s;cenery around, to diffu&s;e over her mind emotions &s;olemn, yet not un|plea&s;ing, but which were &s;oon interrupted by the di&s;tant roar of cannon, echoing among the mountains. The &s;ounds rolled along the wind, and were repeated in faint and fainter reverberation, till they &s;unk in &s;ullen murmurs. This was a &s;ignal, that the enemy had reached the ca&s;tle, and fear for Valancourt again tor|mented Emily. She turned her anxious eyes towards that part of the country, where the edifice &s;tood, but the intervening heights concealed it from her view; &s;till, however, &s;he &s;aw the tall head of a mountain, which immediately fronted her late chamber, and on this &s;he fixed her gaze, as if it could have told her of all that was pa&s;&s;ing in the &s;cene it overlooked. The guides twice reminded her, that &s;he was lo&s;ing time and that they had far to go, before &s;he could turn from this intere&s;ting object, and, even when &s;he again moved onward, &s;he often &s;ent a look back, till only its blue point, brightening in a gleam of &s;un&s;hine, appeared peeping over other mountains.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of the cannon affected Ugo, as the bla&s;t of the trumpet does the war hor&s;e; it called forth all the fire of his nature; he was impatient to be in the mid&s;t of the fight, and uttered frequent execrations again&s;t Montoni for having &s;ent him to a di&s;tance. The feelings of his comrade &s;eemed to be very oppo&s;ite, and adapted rather to the cruelties, than to the dangers of war.</P>
<P>Emily a&s;ked frequent que&s;tions, concerning the place of her de&s;tination, but could only learn, that &s;he was going to a cot|tage in Tu&s;cany; and, whenever &s;he mentioned the &s;ubject, &s;he fancied &s;he perceived, in the countenances of the&s;e men, an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of malice and cunning, that alarmed her.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="029378_0206_0FE0842A2754C190">
It was afternoon, when they had left the ca&s;tle. During &s;e|veral hours, they travelled through regions of profound &s;olitude, where no bleat of &s;heep, or bark of watch dog, broke on &s;ilence, and they were now too far off to hear even the faint thunder of the cannon. Towards evening, they wound down precipices, black with fore&s;ts of cypre&s;s, pine and cedar, into a glen &s;o &s;a|vage and &s;ecluded, that, if Solitude ever had local habitation, this might have been "her place of deare&s;t re&s;idence." To Emi|ly it appeared a &s;pot exactly &s;uited for the retreat of banditti, and, in her imagination, &s;he already &s;aw them lurking under the brow of &s;ome projecting rock, whence their &s;hadows, length|ened by the &s;etting &s;un, &s;tretched acro&s;s the road, and warned the traveller of his danger. She &s;huddered at the idea, and, look|ing at her conductors, to ob&s;erve whether they were armed, thought &s;he &s;aw in them the banditti &s;he dreaded!</P>
<P>It was in this glen, that they propo&s;ed to alight, "For," &s;aid Ugo, "night will come on pre&s;ently, and then the wolves will make it dangerous to &s;top." This was a new &s;ubject of alarm to Emi|ly, but inferior to what &s;he &s;uffered from the thought of be|ing left in the&s;e wilds, at midnight, with two &s;uch men as her pre&s;ent conductors. Dark and dreadful hints of what might be Montoni's purpo&s;e in &s;ending her hither, came to her mind. She endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade the men from &s;topping, and inquired with anxiety, how far they had yet to go.</P>
<P>"Many leagues yet," replied Bertrand. "As for you, Signo|ra, you may do as you plea&s;e about eating, but for us, we will make a hearty &s;upper, while we car. We &s;hall have need of it, I warrant, before we fini&s;h our journey. The &s;un's going down apace; let us alight under that rock, yonder."</P>
<P>His comrade a&s;&s;ented, and, turning the mules out of the road, they advanced towards a cliff, overhung with cedars, Emily fol|lowing in trembling &s;ilence. They lifted her from her mule, and, having &s;eated them&s;elves on the gra&s;s, at the foot of the rocks, drew &s;ome homely fare from a wallet, of which Emily tried to eat a little, the better to di&s;gui&s;e her apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now &s;unk behind the high mountains in the we&s;t, upon which a purple haze began to &s;pread, and the gloom of twilight to draw over the &s;urrounding objects. To the low and &s;ullen murmur of the breeze, pa&s;&s;ing among the woods, &s;he no longer li&s;tened with any degree of plea&s;ure, for it con&s;pired with the wildne&s;s of the &s;cene and the evening hour, to depre&s;s her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Su&s;pen&s;e had &s;o much increa&s;ed her anxiety, as to the pri&s;oner at Udolpho, that, finding it impracticable to &s;peak alone with
<PB N="186" REF="029378_0207_0FE08437B7477D40">
Bertrand, on that &s;ubject, &s;he renewed her que&s;tions in the pre|&s;ence of Ugo; but he either was, or pretended to be, entirely ignorant, concerning the &s;tranger. When he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the que&s;tion, he talked with Ugo on &s;ome &s;ubject, which led to the mention of Signor Or&s;ino and of the affair that had bani&s;hed him from Venice; re&s;pecting which Emily had ventured to a&s;k a few que&s;tions.&mdash;Ugo appeared to be well acquainted with the cir|cum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ances of that tragical event, and related &s;ome minute particulars, that both &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed her; for it appear|ed very extraordinary how &s;uch particulars could be known to any, but to per&s;ons pre&s;ent when the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was committed.</P>
<P>"He was of rank," &s;aid Bertrand, "or the State would not have troubled it&s;elf to inquire after his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The Signor has been lucky hitherto; this is not the fir&s;t affair of the kind he has had upon his hands; and to be &s;ure, when a gentleman has no other way of getting redre&s;s&mdash;why he mu&s;t take this."</P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid Ugo, "and why is not this as good as another? This is the way to have ju&s;tice done at once, without more ado. If you go to law, you mu&s;t &s;tay till the judges plea&s;e, and may lo&s;e your cau&s;e at la&s;t. Why the be&s;t way, then, is to make &s;ure of your right, while you can, and execute ju&s;tice your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Yes, yes," rejoined Bertrand, "if you wait till ju&s;tice is done you&mdash;you may &s;tay long enough. Why if I want a friend of mine properly &s;erved, how am I to get my revenge? Ten to one they will tell me he is in the right, and I am in the wrong. Or, if a fellow has got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property which I think ought to be mine, why I may wait, till I &s;tarve, perhaps, before the law will give it me, and then, after all, the judge may &s;ay&mdash;the e&s;tate is his. What is to be done then?&mdash;Why the ca&s;e is plain enough, I mu&s;t take it at la&s;t."</P>
<P>Emily's horror at this conver&s;ation was heightened by a &s;u&s;|picion, that the latter part of it was pointed again&s;t her&s;elf, and that the&s;e men had been commi&s;&s;ioned by Montoni to execute a &s;imilar kind of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"But I was &s;peaking of Signor Or&s;ino," re&s;umed Bertrand, "he is one of tho&s;e who love to do ju&s;tice at once. I remem|ber about ten years ago, the Signor had a quarrel with a cavali|ero of Milan. The &s;tory was told me then, and it is &s;till fre&s;h in my head. They quarrelled about a lady, that the Signor liked, and &s;he was perver&s;e enough to prefer the gentleman of Milan, and even carried her whim &s;o far as to marry him. This pro|voked the Signor, as well it might, for he had tried to talk rea&s;on to her a long while, and u&s;ed to &s;end people to &s;erenade her, un|der
<PB N="187" REF="029378_0207_0FE08437B7477D40">
her windows of a night; and u&s;ed to make ver&s;es about her, and would &s;wear &s;he was the hand&s;ome&s;t lady in Milan&mdash;But all would not do&mdash;nothing would bring her to rea&s;on; and, as I &s;aid, &s;he went &s;o far at la&s;t, as to marry this other cavaliero. This made the Signor wrath, with a vengeance; he re&s;olved to be even with her though, and he watched his opportunity, and did not wait long, for, &s;oon after the marriage, they &s;et out for Pa|dua, nothing doubting, I warrant, of what was preparing for them. The cavaliero thought, to be &s;ure, he was to be called to no account, but was to go off triumphant; but he was &s;oon made to know another &s;ort of &s;tory."</P>
<P>"What then, the lady had promi&s;ed to have Signor Or&s;ino?" &s;aid Ugo.</P>
<P>"Promi&s;ed! No," replied Bertrand, "&s;he had not wit enough even to tell him &s;he liked him, as I heard, but the contrary, for &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay, from the fir&s;t, &s;he never meant to have him. And this was what provoked the Signor, &s;o, and with good rea&s;on, for, who likes to be told that he is di&s;agreeable? and this was &s;aying as good. It was enough to tell him this; &s;he need not have gone and married another."</P>
<P>"What, &s;he married, then, on purpo&s;e to plague the Signor?" &s;aid Ugo.</P>
<P>"I don't know as for that," replied Bertrand, "they &s;aid, in|deed, that &s;he had had a regard for the other gentleman a great while; but that is nothing to the purpo&s;e, &s;he &s;hould not have married him, and then the Signor would not have been &s;o much provoked. She might have expected what was to follow; it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed he would bear her ill u&s;age tamely, and &s;he might thank her&s;elf for what happened. But, as I &s;aid, they &s;et out for Padua, &s;he and her hu&s;band, and the road lay over &s;ome barren mountains like the&s;e. This &s;uited the Signor's purpo&s;e well. He watched the time of their departure, and &s;ent his men after them with directions what to do. They kept their di&s;tance till they &s;aw their opportunity, and this did not happen till the &s;econd day's journey, when, the gentleman having &s;ent his &s;er|vants forward to the next town, may be to have hor&s;es in readi|ne&s;s, the Signor's men quickened their pace, and overtook the carriage, in a hollow, between two mountains, where the woods prevented the &s;ervants from &s;eeing what pa&s;&s;ed, though they were then not far off. When we came up, we fired our tromboni, but mi&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>Emily turned pale, at the&s;e words, and then hoped &s;he had mi&s;taken them; while Bertrand proceeded:</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="029378_0208_0FE0843C97D3C310">
"The gentleman fired again, but he was &s;oon made to allight and it was as he turned to call his people, that he was &s;truck. It was the mo&s;t dexterous feat you ever &s;aw&mdash;he was &s;truck in the back with three &s;tillettos at once. He fell, and was di&s;patched in a minute; but the lady e&s;caped, for the &s;ervants had heard the &s;iring, and came up before &s;he could be taken care of. 'Ber|trand,' &s;aid the Signor, when his men returned"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Bertrand!" exclaimed Emily, pale with horror, on whom not a &s;yllable of this narrative had been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>"Bertrand, did I &s;ay?" rejoined the man, with &s;ome confu|&s;ion&mdash;"No, Giovanni. But I have forgot where I was;&mdash;'Ber|trand,' &s;aid the Signor"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Bertrand, again!" &s;aid Emily, in a faltering voice, "Why do you repeat that name?"</P>
<P>Bertrand &s;wore. "What &s;ignifies it," he proceeded "what the man was called&mdash;Bertrand, or Giovanni&mdash;or Roberto? it's all one for that. You have put me out twice with that&mdash;que&s;tion. 'Bertrand,' or Giovanni&mdash;or what you will&mdash;'Bertrand,' &s;aid the Signor, 'if your comrades had done their duty, as well as you, I &s;hould not have lo&s;t the lady. Go, my hone&s;t fellow, and be happy with this.' He gave him a pur&s;e of gold&mdash;and little enough too, con&s;idering the &s;ervice he had done him."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye," &s;aid Ugo, "little enough&mdash;little enough."</P>
<P>Emily now breathed with difficulty, and could &s;carcely &s;up|port her&s;elf. When fir&s;t &s;he &s;aw the&s;e men, their appearance, and their connection with Montoni had been &s;ufficient to im|pre&s;s her with di&s;tru&s;t; but now, when one of them had betray|ed him&s;elf to be a murderer, and &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf, at the approach of night, under his guidance, among wild and &s;olitary moun|tains, and going &s;he &s;carcely knew whither, the mo&s;t agonizing terror &s;eized her, which was the le&s;s &s;upportable from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity &s;he found her&s;elf under of concealing all &s;ymptons of it from her companions. Reflecting on the character and the me|naces of Montoni, it appeared not improbable, that he had de|livered her to them, for the purpo&s;e of having her murdered, and of thus &s;ecuring to him&s;elf, without further oppo&s;ition or delay, the e&s;tates, for which he had &s;o long and &s;o de&s;perately contended. Yet, if this was his de&s;ign, there appeared no nece&s;|&s;ity for &s;ending her to &s;uch a di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle; for, if any dread of di&s;covery had made him unwilling to perpetrate the deed there, a much nearer place might have &s;ufficed for the purpo&s;e of concealment. The&s;e con&s;iderations, however, did not immediately occur to Emily, with whom &s;o many circum|&s;tances
<PB N="189" REF="029378_0208_0FE0843C97D3C310">
con&s;pired to rou&s;e terror, that &s;he had no power to op|po&s;e it, or to inquire cooly into its grounds; and, if &s;he had done &s;o, &s;till there were many appearances which would too well have ju&s;tified her mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions. She did not now dare to &s;peak to her conductors, at the &s;ound of who&s;e voices &s;he trembled; and when, now and then, &s;he &s;tole a glance at them, their countenances, &s;een imperfectly through the gloom of even|ing, &s;erved to confirm her fears.</P>
<P>The &s;un had now been &s;et &s;ometime; heavy clouds, who&s;e lower &s;kirts were tinged with &s;ulphureous crim&s;on, lingered in the we&s;t, and threw a reddi&s;h tint upon the pine fore&s;ts, which &s;ent forth a &s;olemn &s;ound, as the breeze rolled over them. The hollow moan &s;truck upon Emily's heart, and &s;erved to render more gloomy and terrific every object around her,&mdash;the moun|tains, &s;haded in twilight&mdash;the gleaming torrent, hoar&s;ely roar|ing&mdash;the black fore&s;ts, and the deep glen, broken into rocky re|ce&s;&s;es, high over&s;hadowed by cypre&s;s and &s;ycamore and winding into long ob&s;curity. To this glen, Emily, as &s;he &s;ent forth her anxious eye, thought there was no end; no hamlet, or even cottage, was &s;een, and &s;till no di&s;tant bark of watch dog, or even faint, far off halloo came on the wind. In a tremulous voice, &s;he now ventured to remind the guides, that it was growing late, and to a&s;k again how far they had to go: but they were too much occupied by their own di&s;cour&s;e to attend to her que&s;tion, which &s;he forbore to repeat, le&s;t it &s;hould provoke a &s;urly an&s;wer. Having, however, &s;oon after, fini&s;hed their &s;upper, the men collected the fragments into their wallet, and proceeded along this winding glen, in gloomy &s;ilence; while Emily again mu&s;ed upon her own &s;ituation, and concerning the motives of Montoni for involving her in it. That it was for &s;ome evil purpo&s;e towards her&s;elf, &s;he could not doubt; and it &s;eemed, that, if he did not intend to de&s;troy her, with a view of immediately &s;eiz|ing her e&s;tates, he meant to re&s;erve her a while in concealment, for &s;ome more terrible de&s;ign, for one that might equally gratify his avarice and &s;till more his deep revenge. At this moment, remembering Signor Brochio and his behaviour in the corridor, a few preceding nights, the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, horrible as it was, &s;trengthened in her belief. Yet, why remove her from the ca&s;tle, where deeds of darkne&s;s had, &s;he feared, been often executed with &s;ecrecy?&mdash;from chambers, perhaps
<Q><L>"With many a foul, and midnight murder &s;tain'd."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="029378_0209_0FE08447C77CB7B0">
The dread of what &s;he might be going to encounter was now &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that it &s;ometimes threatened her &s;en&s;es; and, often as &s;he went, &s;he thought of her late father and of all he would have &s;uffered, could he have fore&s;een the &s;trange and dreadful events of her future life; and how anxiou&s;ly he would have avoided that fatal confidence, which committed his daughter to the care of a woman &s;o weak as was Madame Montoni. So romantic and improbable indeed, did her pre&s;ent &s;ituation appear to Emi|ly her&s;elf, particularly when &s;he compared it with the repo&s;e and beauty of her early days, that there were moments, when &s;he could almo&s;t have believed her&s;elf the victim of frightful vi|&s;ions, glaring upon a di&s;ordered fancy.</P>
<P>Re&s;trained by the pre&s;ence of her guides from expre&s;&s;ing her terrors, their acutene&s;s was, at length, lo&s;t in gloomy de&s;pair. The dreadful view of what might await her hereafter rendered her almo&s;t indifferent to the &s;urrounding dangers. She now looked, with little emotion, on the wild dingles, and the gloomy road and mountains, who&s;e outlines only were di&s;tingui&s;hable through the du&s;k;&mdash;objects, which but lately had affected her &s;pirits &s;o much, as to awaken horrid views of the future, and to tinge the&s;e with their own gloom.</P>
<P>It was now &s;o nearly dark, that the travellers, who proceeded only by the &s;lowe&s;t pace, could &s;carcely di&s;cern their way. The clouds, which &s;eemed charged with thunder, pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly along the heavens, &s;hewing, at intervals, the trembling &s;tars; while the groves of cypre&s;s and &s;ycamore, that overhung the rocks, waved high in the breeze, as it &s;wept over the glen, and then ru&s;hed among the di&s;tant woods. Emily &s;hivered as it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Where is the torch?" &s;aid Ugo, "It grows dark."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o dark yet," replied Bertrand, "but we may find our way, and 'tis be&s;t not light the torch, before we can help, for it may betray us, if any &s;truggling party of the enemy is abroad."</P>
<P>Ugo muttered &s;omething, which Emily did not under&s;tand, and they proceeded in darkne&s;s, while &s;he almo&s;t wi&s;hed, that the enemy might di&s;cover them; for from change there was &s;omething to hope, &s;ince &s;he could &s;carcely imagine any &s;ituation more dreadful than her pre&s;ent one.</P>
<P>As they moved &s;lowly along, her attention was &s;urpri&s;ed by a thin tapering flame, that appeared, by fits, at the point of the pike, which Bertrand carried, re&s;embling what &s;he had ob&s;erved on the lance of the &s;entinel, the night Madame Montoni died, and which he had &s;aid was an omen. The event immediately following it appeared to ju&s;tify the a&s;&s;ertion, and a &s;uper&s;titious

impre&s;&s;ion had remained on Emily's mind, which the pre&s;ent ap|pearance confirmed. She thought it was an omen of her own fate, and watched it &s;ucce&s;&s;ively vani&s;h and return, in gloomy &s;ilence, which was at length interrupted by Bertrand.</P>
<P>"Let us light the torch," &s;aid he, "and get under &s;helter of the woods;&mdash;a &s;torm is coming on&mdash;look at my lance."</P>
<P>He held it forth, with the flame tapering at its point<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Abbey B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lon on Electricity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid Ugo, "you are not one of tho&s;e, that believe in omens: we have left cowards at the ca&s;tle, who would turn pale at &s;uch a &s;ight, I have often &s;een it before a thunder &s;torm, it is an omen of that, and one is coming now, &s;ure enough. The clouds fla&s;h fa&s;t already."</P>
<P>Emily was relieved by this conver&s;ation from &s;ome of the ter|rors of &s;uper&s;tition, but tho&s;e of rea&s;on increa&s;ed, as, waiting while Ugo &s;earched for a flint, to &s;trike fire, &s;he watched the pale lightning gleam over the woods they were about to enter, and illuminate the har&s;h countenances of her companions. Ugo could not find a flint, and Bertrand became impatient, for the thunder &s;ounded hollowly at a di&s;tance, and the lightning was more frequent. Sometimes, it revealed the nearer rece&s;&s;es of the woods, or, di&s;playing &s;ome opening in their &s;ummits, illuminated the ground beneath with partial &s;plendour, the thick foliage of the trees pre&s;erving the &s;urrounding &s;cene in deep &s;hadow.</P>
<P>At length, Ugo found a flint, and the torch was lighted. The men then di&s;mounted, and, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted Emily, led the mules towards the woods, that &s;kirted the glen, on the left, over broken ground, frequently interrupted with bru&s;h-wood and wild plants, which &s;he was often obliged to make a circuit to avoid.</P>
<P>She could not approach the&s;e woods, without experiencing keener &s;en&s;e of her danger. Their deep &s;ilence, except when the wind &s;wept among their branches, and impenetrable glooms &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wn partially by the &s;udden fla&s;h, and then, by the red glare of the torch, which &s;erved only to make "darkne&s;s vi&s;ible," were circum&s;tances, that contributed to renew all her mo&s;t terrible ap|prehen&s;ions; &s;he thought, too, that, at this moment, the coun|tenances of her conductors di&s;played more than their u&s;ual fierce|ne&s;s, mingled with a kind of lurking exultation, which they &s;eemed endeavouring to di&s;gui&s;e. To her affrighted fancy it occurred, that they were leading her into the&s;e woods to com|pleat the will of Montoni by her murder. The horrid &s;ugge&s;|tion called a groan from her heart, which &s;urpri&s;ed her compan|ions, who turned round quickly towards her, and &s;he demand|ed
<PB N="192" REF="029378_0210_0FE0844D62933A10">
why they led her thither, be&s;eeching them to continue their way along the open glen, which &s;he repre&s;ented to be le&s;s dan|gerous than the woods, in a thunder &s;torm.</P>
<P>"No, no," &s;aid Bertrand, "we know be&s;t where the danger lies. See how the clouds open over our heads. Be&s;ides, we can glide under cover of the woods with le&s;s hazard of being &s;een, &s;hould any of the enemy be wandering this way. By holy St. Peter and all the re&s;t of them, I've as &s;tout a heart as the be&s;t, as many a poor devil could tell, if he were alive again&mdash;but what can we do again&s;t numbers?"</P>
<P>"What are you whining about?" &s;aid Ugo, contemptuou&s;ly, "who fears numbers! Let them come, though they were as ma|ny as the Signor's ca&s;tle could hold; I would &s;hew the knaves what fighting is. For you&mdash;I would lay you quietly in a dry ditch, were you might peep out, and &s;ee me put the rogues to flight.&mdash;Who talks of fear!"</P>
<P>Bertrand replied, with an horrible oath, that he did not like &s;uch je&s;ting, and a violent altercation en&s;ued, which was, at length &s;ilenced by the thunder, who&s;e deep volley was heard afar, rol|ling onward till it bur&s;t over their heads in &s;ounds, that &s;eemed to &s;hake the earth to its centre. The ruffians pau&s;ed, and look|ed upon each other. Between the boles of the trees, the blue lightning fla&s;hed and quivered along the ground, while, as Emily looked under the boughs, the mountains beyond frequently ap|peared to be clothed in livid flame. At this moment, perhaps, &s;he felt le&s;s fear of the &s;torm, than did either of her companions, for other terrors occupied her mind.</P>
<P>The men now re&s;ted under an enormous che&s;nut tree, and fix|ed their pikes in the ground, at &s;ome di&s;tance, on the iron points of which Emily repeatedly ob&s;erved the lightning play, and then glide down them into the earth.</P>
<P>"I would we were well in the Signor's ca&s;tle!" &s;aid Ber|trand, "I know not why he &s;hould &s;end us on this bu&s;ine&s;s. Hark I how it rattles above, there! I could almo&s;t find in my heart to turn prie&s;t, and pray. Ugo, ha&s;t got a ro&s;ary?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Ugo, "I leave it to cowards like thee to car|ry ro&s;aries&mdash;I, carry a &s;word."</P>
<P>"And much good may it do thee in fighting again&s;t the &s;torm?" &s;aid Bertrand.</P>
<P>Another peal, which was reverberated in tremenduous echoes among the mountains, &s;ilenced them for a moment. As it rol|led away, Ugo propo&s;ed going on. "We are only lo&s;ing time here," &s;aid he, "for the thick boughs of the woods will &s;hel|ter us as well as this che&s;nut tree."</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="029378_0210_0FE0844D62933A10">
They again led the mules forward, between the boles of the trees, and over pathle&s;s gra&s;s, that concealed their high knotted roots. The ri&s;ing wind was now heard contending with the thunder, as it ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly among the branches above, and brightened the red flame of the torch, which threw a &s;tronger light forward among the woods, and &s;hewed their gloomy re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;es to be &s;uitable re&s;orts for the wolves, of which Ugo had formerly &s;poken.</P>
<P>At length, the &s;trength of the wind &s;eemed to drive the &s;torm before it, for the thunder rolled away into di&s;tance, and was on|ly faintly heard. After travelling through the woods for nearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hour, during which, the elements &s;eemed to have returned to repo&s;e, the travellers, gradually a&s;cending from the glen, found them&s;elves upon the open brow of a mountain, with a wide valley, extending in mi&s;ty moonlight, at their feet, and above, the blue &s;ky, trembling through the few thin clouds, that linger|ed after the &s;torm, and were &s;inking &s;lowly to the verge of the horizon.</P>
<P>Emily's &s;pirits, now that &s;he had quitted the woods, began to revive; for &s;he con&s;idered, that, if the&s;e men had received an order to de&s;troy her, they would probably have executed their barbarous purpo&s;e in the &s;olitary wild, from whence they had ju&s;t emerged, where the deed would have been &s;hrouded from every human eye. Rea&s;&s;ured by this reflection, and by the quiet demeanour of her guides, Emily, as they proceeded &s;ilently in a kind of &s;heep track, that wound along the &s;kirts of the woods, which a&s;cended on the right, could not &s;urvey the &s;leeping beauty of the vale, to which they were declining, without a momentary &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure. It &s;eemed varied with woods, pa&s;tures, and &s;loping grounds, and was &s;creened to the north and the ea&s;t by an amphitheatre of the Apennines, who&s;e outline on the horizon was here broken into varied and elegant forms; to the we&s;t and the &s;outh, the land&s;cape extended indi&s;tinctly into the lowlands of Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>"There is the &s;ea yonder," &s;aid Bertrand, as if he had known that Emily was examining the twilight view, "yonder in the we&s;t, though we cannot &s;ee it."</P>
<P>Emily already perceived a change in the climate, from that of the wild and mountanous tract &s;he had left; and, as &s;he con|tinued de&s;cending, the air became perfumed by the breath of a thou&s;and namele&s;s flowers among the gra&s;s, called forth by the late rain. So &s;oothingly beautiful was the &s;cene around her, and &s;o &s;trikingly contra&s;ted to the gloomy grandeur of tho&s;e, to
<PB N="194" REF="029378_0211_0FE08457E7D48498">
which &s;he had long been confined, and to the manners of the people, who moved among them, that &s;he could almo&s;t have fancied her&s;elf again at La Vallee, and, wondering why Montoni had &s;ent her hither, could &s;carcely believe, that he had &s;elected &s;o enchanting a &s;pot for any cruel de&s;ign. It was, however, probably not the &s;pot, but the per&s;ons, who happened to inhabit it, and to who&s;e care he could &s;afely commit the execution of his plans, whatever they might be, that had determined his choice.</P>
<P>She now ventured again to inquire, whether they were near the place of their de&s;tination, and was an&s;wered by Ugo, that they had not far to go. "Only to the wood of che&s;nuts in the valley yonder," &s;aid he, "there, by the brook, that &s;parkles with the moon; I wi&s;h I was once at re&s;t there, with a fla&s;k of good wine, and a &s;lice of Tu&s;cany bacon."</P>
<P>Emily's &s;pirits revived, when &s;he heard, that the journey was &s;o nearly concluded, and &s;aw the wood of che&s;nuts in an open part of the vale, on the margin of the &s;tream.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, they reached the entrance of the wood, and perceived, between the twinkling leaves, a light, &s;treaming from a di&s;tant cottage window. They proceeded along the edge of the brook to where the trees, crowding over it, excluded the moonbeams, but a long line of light, from the cottage above, was &s;een on its dark tremulous &s;urface. Bertrand now &s;tepped on fir&s;t, and Emily heard him knock, and call loudly at the door. As &s;he reached it, the &s;mall upper ca&s;ement, where the light ap|peared, was unclo&s;ed by a man, who, having inquired what they wanted, immediately de&s;cended, let them into a neat ru&s;tic cot, and called up his wife to &s;et refre&s;hments before the travellers. As this man conver&s;ed, rather apart, with Bertrand, Emily an|xiou&s;ly &s;urveyed him. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as a tall, but not robu&s;t pea&s;ant, of a &s;allow complexion, and had a &s;hrewd and cunning eye; his countenance was not of a character to win the ready confidence of youth, and there was nothing in his manner, that might con|ciliate a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Ugo called impatiently for &s;upper, and in a tone as if he knew his authority here to be unque&s;tionable. "I expected you an hour ago," &s;aid the pea&s;ant, "for I have had Signor Montoni's letter the&s;e three hours, and I and my wife had given you up, and gone to bed. How did you fare in the &s;torm?"</P>
<P>"Ill enough," replied Ugo, "ill enough, and we are like to fare ill enough here too, unle&s;s you will make more ha&s;te. Get us more wine, and let us &s;ee what you have to eat."</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="029378_0211_0FE08457E7D48498">
The pea&s;ant placed before them all, that his cottage afforded; ham, wine, figs, and grapes of &s;uch &s;ize and flavour, as Emily had &s;eldom ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>After taking refre&s;hment, &s;he was &s;hewn by the pea&s;ant's wife to her little bed-chamber, where &s;he a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions con|cerning Montoni, to which the woman, who&s;e name was Dorina, gave re&s;erved an&s;wers, pretending ignorance of his <HI>Excellenza's</HI> intention in &s;ending Emily hither, but acknowledging that her hu&s;band had been apprized of the circum&s;tance. Perceiving, that &s;he could obtain no intelligence concerning her de&s;tination, Emily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Dorina, and retired to repo&s;e; but all the bu&s;y &s;cenes of the pa&s;t and the anticipated ones of the future came to her anxious mind, and con&s;pired with the &s;en&s;e of her new &s;itua|tion to bani&s;h &s;leep.</P>

<P>WHEN Emily, in the morning, opened her ca&s;ement, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve the beauties, that &s;urrounded it. The cottage was nearly embowered in the woods, which were chief|ly of che&s;nut, intermixed with &s;ome cypre&s;s, larch and &s;yca|more. Beneath the dark and &s;preading branches, appeared, to the north, and to the ea&s;t, the woody Apennines, ri&s;ing in ma|je&s;tic amphitheatre, not black with pines, as &s;he had been accu&s;|tomed to &s;ee them, but their loftie&s;t &s;ummits crowned with an|cient fore&s;ts of che&s;nut, oak, and oriental plane, now animated with the rich tints of atumn, and which &s;wept downward to the valley uninterruptedly, except where &s;ome bold rocky promon|tory looked out from among the foliage, and caught the pa&s;&s;ing gleam. Vineyards &s;tretched along the feet of the mountains, where the elegant villas of the Tu&s;can nobility frequently adorn|ed
<PB N="196" REF="029378_0212_0FE0845D800E4070">
the &s;cene, and overlooked &s;lopes clothed with groves of olive, mulberry, orange and lemon. The plain, to which the&s;e de|clined, was coloured with the riches of cultivation, who&s;e min|gled hues were mellowed into harmony by an Italian &s;un. Vines, their purple clu&s;tres blu&s;hing between the ru&s;&s;et foliage, hung in luxuriant fe&s;toons from the branches of &s;tandard fig and cherry trees, while pa&s;tures of verdure, &s;uch as Emily had &s;eldom &s;een in Italy, enriched the banks of a &s;tream that, after de&s;cending from the mountains, wound along the land&s;cape, which it reflect|ed, to a bay of the &s;ea. There, far in the we&s;t, the waters, fad|ing into the &s;ky, a&s;&s;umed a tint of the fainte&s;t purple, and the line of &s;eparation between them was, now and then, di&s;cernible only by the progre&s;s of a &s;ail, brightened with the &s;unbeam, along the horizon.</P>
<P>The cottage, which was &s;haded by the woods from the inten|&s;er rays of the &s;un, and was open only to his evening light, was covered entirely with vines, fig trees and je&s;&s;amine, who&s;e flow|ers &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in &s;ize and fragrance any that Emily had &s;een. The&s;e and ripening clu&s;ters of grapes hung round her little ca&s;ement. The turf, that grew under the woods, was inlaid with a variety of wild flowers and perfumed herbs, and, on the oppo&s;ite margin of the &s;tream, who&s;e current diffu&s;ed fre&s;hne&s;s beneath the &s;hades, ro&s;e a grove of lemon and orange trees. This, though nearly oppo&s;ite to Emily's window, did not interrupt her pro&s;pect, but rather heightened, by its dark verdure, the effect of the per&s;pec|tive; and to her this &s;pot was a bower of &s;weets, who&s;e charms communicated imperceptibly to her mind &s;omewhat of their own &s;erenity.</P>
<P>She was &s;oon &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t, by the pea&s;ant's daugh|ter, a girl about &s;eventeen, of a plea&s;ant countenance, which, Emily was glad to ob&s;erve, &s;eemed animated with the pure af|fections of nature, though the others, that &s;urrounded her, ex|pre&s;&s;ed, more or le&s;s, the wor&s;t qualities&mdash;cruelty, ferocity, cun|ning and duplicity; of the latter &s;tyle of countenance, e&s;pecial|ly, were tho&s;e of the pea&s;ant and his wife. Maddelina &s;poke little, but what &s;he &s;aid was in a &s;oft voice, and with an air of mode&s;ty and complacency, that intere&s;ted Emily, who breakfa&s;t|ed at a &s;eparate table with Dorina, while Ugo and Bertrand were taking a repa&s;t of Tu&s;cany bacon and wine with their ho&s;t, near the cottage door; when they had fini&s;hed which, Ugo, ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, inquired for his mule, and Emily learned that he was to return to Udolpho, while Bertrand remained at the cottage; a circum&s;tance, which, though it did not &s;urpri&s;e, di&s;tre&s;ted her.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="029378_0212_0FE0845D800E4070">
When Ugo was departed, Emily propo&s;ed to walk in the neighbouring woods; but, on being told, that &s;he mu&s;t not quit the cottage, without having Bertrand for her attendant, &s;he with|drew to her own room. There, as her eyes &s;ettled on the tow|ering Apennines, &s;he recollected the terrific &s;cenery they had ex|hibited and the horrors &s;he had &s;uffered, on the preceding night, particularly at the moment when Bertrand had betrayed him&s;elf to be an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; and the&s;e remembrances awakened a train of images, which, &s;ince they ab&s;tracted her from a con&s;ideration of her own &s;ituation, &s;he pur&s;ued for &s;ometime, and then arranged in the following lines; plea&s;ed to have di&s;covered any innocent means, by which &s;he could beguile an hour of misfortune.</P>

that the pea&s;ant and his wife were old inhabitants of this cottage, which had been purcha&s;ed for them by Montoni, in re|ward of &s;ome &s;ervice, rendered him, many years before, by Mar|co, to whom Carlo, the &s;teward at the ca&s;tle, was nearly related. "So many years ago, Signora," added Maddelina, "that I know nothing about it; but my father did the Signor a great good, for my mother has often &s;aid to him, this cottage was the lea&s;t he ought to have had."</P>
<P>To the mention of this circum&s;tance Emily li&s;tened with a painful intere&s;t, &s;ince it appeared to give a frightful colour to the character of Marco, who&s;e &s;ervice, thus rewarded by Montoni, &s;he could &s;carcely doubt had been criminal; and, if &s;o, had too much rea&s;on to believe, that &s;he had been committed into his hands for &s;ome de&s;perate purpo&s;e. "Did you ever hear how many years it is," &s;aid Emily, who was con&s;idering of Signora Laurentini's di&s;appearance from Udolpho, "&s;ince your father performed the &s;ervices you &s;poke of?"</P>
<P>"It was a little before he came to live at the cottage, Signo|ra," replied Maddelina, "and that is about eighteen years ago."</P>
<P>This was near the period, when Signora Laurentini had been &s;aid to di&s;appear, and it occurred to Emily, that Marco had a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in that my&s;terious affair, and, perhaps, had been employed in a murder! This horrible &s;ugge&s;tion fixed her in &s;uch profound reverie, that Maddelina quitted the room, unperceived by her, and &s;he remained uncon&s;cious of all around her, for a con&s;idera|ble time. Tears, at length, came to her relief, after indulging which, her &s;pirits becoming calmer, &s;he cea&s;ed to tremble at a view of evils, that might never arrive; and had &s;ufficient re&s;o|lution to endeavour to withdraw her thoughts from the contem|plation of her own intere&s;ts. Remembering the few books, which even in the hurry of her departure from Udolpho &s;he had put into her little package, &s;he &s;at down with one of them at her plea&s;ant ca&s;ement, whence her eyes often wandered from the page to the land&s;cape who&s;e beauty gradually &s;oothed her mind into gentle melancholy.</P>
<P>Here, &s;he remained alone, till evening, and &s;aw the &s;un de|&s;cend the we&s;tern &s;ky, throw all his pomp of light and &s;hadow upon the mountains, and gleam upon the di&s;tant ocean and the &s;tealing &s;ails, as he &s;unk amid&s;t the waves. Then, at the mu&s;ing hour of twilight, her &s;oftened thoughts returned to Valancourt; &s;he again recollected every circum&s;tance, connected with the midnight mu&s;ic, and all that might a&s;&s;i&s;t her conjecture, con|cerning his impri&s;onment at the ca&s;tle, and, becoming confirmed

in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it was his voice &s;he had heard there, &s;he looked back to that gloomy abode with emotions of grief and momentary regret.</P>
<P>Refre&s;hed by the cool and fragrant air, and her &s;pirits &s;oothed to a &s;tate of gentle melancholy by the &s;tilly murmur of the brook below and of the woods around, &s;he lingered at her ca&s;ement long after the &s;un had &s;et, watching the valley &s;inking into ob|&s;curity, till only the grand outline of the &s;urrounding mountain &s;hadowed upon the horizon, remained vi&s;ible. But a clear moonlight, that &s;ucceeded, gave to the land&s;cape, what time gives to the &s;cenes of pa&s;t life, when it &s;oftens all their har&s;her features, and throws over the whole the mellowing &s;hade of di&s;|tant contemplation. The &s;cenes of La Vallee, in the early morn of her life, when &s;he was protected and beloved by parents equal|ly loved, appeared in Emily's memory tenderly beautiful, like the pro&s;pect before her, and awakened mournful compari&s;ons. Unwilling to encounter the coar&s;e behaviour of the pea&s;ant's wife, &s;he remained &s;upperle&s;s in her room, while &s;he wept again over her forlorn and perilous &s;ituation, a review of which entire|ly overc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me the &s;mall remains of her fortitude, and, reducing her to temporary de&s;pondence, &s;he wi&s;hed to be relea&s;ed from this heavy load of life, that had &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed her, and prayed to Heaven to take her, in its mercy to her parents.</P>
<P>Wearied with weeping, &s;he, at length, lay down on her mat|tra&s;s, and &s;unk to &s;leep, but was &s;oon awakened by a knocking at her chamber door, and &s;tarting up in terror, &s;he heard a voice calling her. The image of Bertrand, with a &s;tilletto in his hand appeared to her alarmed fancy, and &s;he neither opened the door, or an&s;wered, but li&s;tened in profound &s;ilence, till the voice re|peating her name in the &s;ame low tone, &s;he demanded who cal|led. "It is I Signora," replied the voice, which &s;he now di&s;|tingui&s;hed to be Maddelina's, "pray open the door. Don't be frightened, it is I."</P>
<P>"And what brings you here &s;o late, Maddelina?" &s;aid Emi|ly, as &s;he let her in. "Hu&s;h! Signora, for heaven's &s;ake hu&s;h, if we are overheard I &s;hall never be forgiven. My father and mother and Bertrand are all gone to bed," continued Maddeli|na, as &s;he gently &s;hut the door, and crept forward, "and I have brought you &s;ome &s;upper, for you had none, you know, Signo|ra, below &s;tairs. Here are &s;ome grapes and figs and half a cup of wine." Emily thanked her, but expre&s;&s;ed apprehen&s;ion le&s;t this kindne&s;s &s;hould draw upon her the re&s;entment of Dorina, when &s;he perceived the fruit was gone. "Take it back, there|fore,

Maddelina," added Emily, "I &s;hall &s;uffer much le&s;s from the want of it, than I &s;hould do, if this act of good nature was to &s;ubject you to your mother's di&s;plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"O Signora! there is no danger of that," replied Maddeli|na, "my mother cannot mi&s;s the fruit, for I &s;aved it from my own &s;upper. You will make me very unhappy, if you refu&s;e to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Signora." Emily was &s;o much affected by this in&s;tance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> good girl's genero&s;ity, that &s;he remained for &s;ometime unable to reply, and Maddelina, watched her in &s;ilence, till, mi&s;|taken the cau&s;e of her emotion, &s;he &s;aid, "Do not weep &s;o Sig|nora! My mother, to be &s;ure, is a little cro&s;s, &s;ometimes, but then it is &s;oon over,&mdash;&s;o don't take it &s;o much to heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> me, too, but then I have learned to bear it, and, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> done, if I can but &s;teal out into the woods and play upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ticcado, I forget it all directly."</P>
<P>Emily, &s;miling through her tears, told Maddelina, that &s;he was a good girl, and then accepted her offering. She wi&s;hed anxiou&s;ly to know, whether Bertrand and Dorina had &s;poken of Montoni, or of his de&s;igns, concerning her&s;elf, in the pre&s;ence of Maddelina, but di&s;dained to tempt the innocent girl to a con|duct &s;o mean, as that of betraying the private conver&s;ation of her parents. When &s;he was departing, Emily reque&s;ted, that &s;he would come to her room as often as &s;he dared, without offending her mother&punc; and Maddelina, after promi&s;ing, that &s;he would do &s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oftly back again to her own chamber.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;everal days pa&s;&s;ed, during which Emily remained in her own room, Maddelina attending her only at her repa&s;t, who&s;e gentle countenance and manners &s;oothed her more than any cir|cum&s;tance &s;he had known for many months. Of her plea&s;ant embowered chamber &s;he now became fond, and began to expe|rience in it tho&s;e feelings of &s;ecurity, which we naturally at|tatch to home. In this interval al&s;o, her mind, having been un|di&s;turbed by any new circum&s;tance of di&s;gu&s;t, or alarm, recover|ed its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ufficiently to permit her the enjoyment of her books, among which &s;he found &s;ome unfini&s;hed &s;ketches of land&s;capes, &s;everal blank &s;heets of paper, with her drawing in&s;truments, and &s;he was thus enabled to amu&s;e her&s;elf with &s;electing &s;ome of the lovely features of the pro&s;pect, that her window commanded, and combining them in &s;cenes, to which her ta&s;teful fancy gave a la&s;t grace. In the&s;e little &s;ketches &s;he generally placed intere&s;t|ing groups, characteri&s;tic of the &s;cenery they animated, and often contrived to tell, with per&s;picuity, &s;ome &s;imple and affecting &s;tory, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n as a tear fell over the pictured griefs, which has

Imagination drew, &s;he would forget, for a moment, her real &s;uf|ferings. Thus innocently &s;he beguiled the heavy hours of mi&s;|fortune, and, with meek patience, awaited the events of futurity.</P>
<P>A beautiful evening that had &s;ucceeded to a &s;ultry day, at length induced Emily to walk, though &s;he knew that Bertrand mu&s;t attend her, and, with Maddelina for her companion, &s;he left the cottage, followed by Bertrand, who allowed her to choo&s;e her own way. The hour was cool and &s;ilent, and &s;he could not look upon the country around her, without delight. How love|ly, too, appeared the brilliant blue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> coloured all the upper region of the air, and, thence fading downward, was lo&s;t in the &s;affron glow of the horizon! Nor le&s;s &s;o were the varied &s;hades and warm colouring of the Apennines, as the evening &s;un threw his &s;lanting rays athwart their broken &s;urface. Emily followed the cour&s;e of the &s;tream, under the &s;hades, that over|hung its gra&s;&s;y margin. On the oppo&s;ite banks, the pa&s;tures were animated with herds of cattle of a beautiful cream colour; and, beyond, were groves of lemon and orange, with fruit glow|ing on the branches, frequent almo&s;t as the leaves, which partly concealed it. She pur&s;ued her way towards the &s;ea, which re|flected the warm glow of &s;un&s;et, while the cliffs, that ro&s;e over its edge, were tinted with the la&s;t rays. The valley was ter|minated on the right by a lofty promontory, who&s;e &s;ummit, im|pending over the waves, was crowned with a ruined tower, now &s;erving for the purpo&s;e of a beacon, who&s;e &s;hattered battlements and the extended wing of &s;ome &s;ea fowl, that circled near it, were &s;till illumined by the upward beams of the &s;un, though his di&s;k was now &s;unk beneath the horizon; while the lower part of the ruin, the cliff on which it &s;tood and the waves as its foot, were &s;haded with the fir&s;t tints of twilight.</P>
<P>Having reached this headland, Emily gazed with &s;olemn plea&s;ure on the cliffs, that extended on either hand along the &s;eque&s;tered &s;hores, &s;ome crowned with groves of pine, and others exhibiting only barren precipices of a grayi&s;h marble, except where the crags were tufted with myrtle and other aromatic &s;hrubs. The &s;ea &s;lept in a perfect calm; its waves, dying in murmurs on the &s;hores, flowed with the gentle&s;t undulation, while its clear &s;urface reflected in &s;oftened beauty the vermeil tints of the we&s;t. Emily, as &s;he looked upon the ocean, thought of France and of pa&s;t times, and &s;he wi&s;hed, Oh! how ardently, and vainly&mdash;wi&s;hed! that its waves would bear her to her di&s;|tant, native home!</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="029378_0215_0FE0847E4D21B990">
"Ah! that ve&s;&s;el," &s;aid &s;he, "that ve&s;&s;el, which glides along &s;o &s;tately, with its tall &s;ails reflected in the water, is, perhaps, bound for France! Happy&mdash;happy bark!" She continued to gaze upon it, with warm emotion, till the gray of twilight ob|&s;cured the di&s;tance, and veiled it from her view. The melan|choly &s;ound of the waves at her feet a&s;&s;i&s;ted the tenderne&s;s, that occa&s;ioned her tears, and this was the only &s;ound, that broke up|on the hour, till, having followed the windings of the beach, for &s;ometime, a chorus of voices pa&s;&s;ed her on the air. She pau&s;ed a moment, wi&s;hing to hear more, yet fearing to be &s;een, and, for the fir&s;t time, looked back to Bertrand, as her protector, who was following, at a &s;hort di&s;tance, in company with &s;ome other per&s;on. Rea&s;&s;ured by this circum&s;tance, &s;he advanced towards the &s;ounds, which &s;eemed to ari&s;e from behind a high promon|tory, that projected athwart the beach. There was now a &s;ud|den pau&s;e in the mu&s;ic, and then one female voice was heard to &s;ing in a kind of chant. Emily quickened her &s;teps, and, wind|ing round the rock, &s;aw, within the &s;weeping bay, beyond, which was hung with woods from the borders of the beach to the very &s;ummit of the cliffs, two groups of pea&s;ants, one &s;eated beneath the &s;hades, and the other &s;tanding on the edge of the &s;ea, round the girl, who was &s;inging, and who held in her hand a chaplet of flowers, which &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> about to drop into the waves.</P>
<P>Emily, li&s;tening with &s;urpri&s;e and attention, di&s;tingui&s;hed the following invocation delivered in the pure and elegant tongue of Tu&s;cany and accompanied by a few pa&s;toral in&s;truments.</P>

The la&s;t words being repeated by the &s;urrounding group, the garland of flowers was thrown into the waves, and the chorus, &s;inking gradually into a chant, died away in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"What can this mean, Maddelina!" &s;aid Emily, awaken|ing from the plea&s;ing trance, into which the mu&s;ic had lulled her. "This is the eve of a fe&s;tival, Signora," replied Madde|lina; "and the pea&s;ants then amu&s;e them&s;elves with all kinds of &s;ports."</P>
<P>"But they talked of a &s;ea-nymph," &s;aid Emily: "how came the&s;e good people to think of a &s;ea-nymph?"</P>
<P>"O, Signora," rejoined Maddelina, mi&s;taking the rea&s;on of Emily's &s;urpri&s;e, "nobody <HI>believes</HI> in &s;uch things, but our old &s;ongs tell of them, and, when we are at our &s;ports, we &s;ometimes &s;ing to them and throw garlands into the &s;ea."</P>
<P>Emily had been early taught to venerate Florence as the &s;eat of literature and of the fine arts; but, that its ta&s;te for cla&s;&s;ic &s;tory &s;hould de&s;cend to the pea&s;ants of the country, occa&s;ioned her both &s;urpri&s;e and admiration. The Arcadian air of the girls next attracted her attention. Their dre&s;s was a very &s;hort full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white &s;ilk; the &s;leeves loo&s;e, and tied up at the &s;houlders with ribbons and bunches of flowers. Their hair, falling in ringlets on their necks, was al&s;o ornamented with flowers, and with a &s;mall &s;traw hat, which, &s;et rather backward and on one &s;ide of the head, gave an expre&s;&s;ion of gaiety and &s;martne&s;s to the whole figure. When the &s;ong had concluded, &s;everal of the&s;e girls approached Emily, and, inviting her to &s;it down among them, offered her, and Maddelina, whom they knew, grape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and figs.</P>
<P>Emily accepted their courte&s;y, much plea&s;ed with the gentle|ne&s;s and grace of their manners, which appeared to be perfectly natural to them: and when Bertrand, &s;oon after, approached, and was ha&s;tily drawing her away, a pea&s;ant, holding up a fla&s;k, invited him to drink; a temptation, which Bertrand was &s;eldom very valiant in re&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>"Let the young lady join in the dance, my friend," &s;aid the pea&s;ant, "while we empty this fla&s;k. They are going to begin directly. Strike up! my lads, &s;trike up your tambourines and merry flutes!"</P>
<P>They &s;ounded gaily; and the younger pea&s;ants formed them|&s;elves into a circle, which Emily would readily have joined, had her &s;pirits been in uni&s;on with their mirth. Maddelina, how|ever, tripped it lightly, and Emily, as &s;he looked on the happy group, lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of her misfortunes in that of a benevolent

But the pen&s;ive melancholy of her mind returned, as &s;he &s;at rather apart from the company, li&s;tening to the mellow mu&s;ic, which the breeze &s;oftened as it bore it away, and watch|ing the moon, &s;tealing its tremulous light over the waves and on the woody &s;ummits of the cliffs, that wound along the&s;e Tu&s;|can &s;hores.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Bertrand was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his fir&s;t fla&s;k, that he very willingly commenced the attack of a &s;econd, and it was late before Emily, not without &s;ome apprehen&s;ion, returned to the cottage.</P>
<P>After this evening, &s;he frequently walked with Maddelina, but was never unattended by Bertrand; and her mind became by degrees as tranquil as the circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation would permit. The quiet, in which &s;he was &s;uffered to live, encour|aged her to hope, that &s;he was not &s;ent hither with an evil de|&s;ign; and, had it not appeared probable, that Valancourt was at this time an inhabitant of Udolpho, &s;he would have wi&s;hed to remain at the cottage, till an opportunity &s;hould offer of return|ing to her native country. But, concerning Montoni's motive for &s;ending her into Tu&s;cany, &s;he was more than ever perplexed, nor could &s;he believe that any con&s;ideration for her &s;afety had influenced him on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>She had been &s;ometime at the cottage, before &s;he recollected that, in the hurry of leaving Udolpho, &s;he had forgotten the pa|pers committed to her by her late aunt, relative to the Langue|doc e&s;tates; but, though this remembrance occa&s;ioned her much unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;he had &s;ome hope, that in the ob&s;cure place, where they were depo&s;ited, they would e&s;cape the detection of Montoni.</P>

<P>WE now return for a moment, to Venice, where Count Morano was &s;uffering under an accumulation of misfortunes. Soon after his arrival in that city, he had been arre&s;ted by order of the &s;enate, and, without knowing of what he was &s;u&s;pected, was conveyed to a place of confinement, whither the mo&s;t &s;tren|uous

inquiries of his friends had been unable to trace him. Who the enemy was, that had occa&s;ioned him this calamity, he had not been able to gue&s;s, unle&s;s, indeed, it was Montoni, on whom his &s;u&s;picion re&s;ted, and not only with much apparent probabil|ity, but with ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In the affair of the poi&s;oned cup, Montoni had &s;u&s;pected Mo|rano; but, being unable to obtain the degree of proof, which was nece&s;&s;ary to convict him of a guilty intention, he had re|cour&s;e to means of other revenge, than he could hope to obtain by pro&s;ecution. He employed a per&s;on, in whom he believed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e might confide, to drop a letter of accu&s;ation into the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">-&s;ecrete,</HI> or lions' mouths, which are fixed in a gallery of the Doge's palace, as receptacles for annonymous information, con|cerning per&s;ons, who may be di&s;affected towards the &s;tate. As, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, the accu&s;er is not confronted with the accu|&s;ed, a man may &s;afely impeach his enemy, and accompli&s;h an unju&s;t revenge, without fear of puni&s;hment, or detection. That Montoni &s;hould have recour&s;e to the&s;e diabolical means of ruin|ing a per&s;on whom he &s;u&s;pected of having attempted his life, is not in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing. In the letter, which he had employed as the in&s;trument of his revenge, he accu&s;ed Morano of de&s;igns a-agin&s;t the &s;tate, which he attempted to prove with all the plau&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">plicity of which he was ma&s;ter; and the &s;enate, with whom a &s;u&s;picion was, at that time, almo&s;t equal to a proof, arre&s;ted the Count, in con&s;equence of this accu&s;ation; and, without even hinting to him his crime, threw him into one of tho&s;e &s;ecret pri&s;ons, which were the terror of the Venetians, and in which per&s;ons often langui&s;hed, and &s;ometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> died, without being di&s;covered by their friends.</P>
<P>Morano had incurred the per&s;onal re&s;entment of many mem|bers of the &s;tate; his habits of life had rendered him obnoxious to &s;ome; and his ambition, and the bold rival&s;hip, which he di&s;|covered, on &s;everal public occa&s;ions,&mdash;to others; and it was not to be expected, that mercy would &s;often the rigour of a law, which was to be di&s;pen&s;ed from the hands of his enemies.</P>
<P>Montoni, meantime, was be&s;et by dangers of another kind. His ca&s;tle was be&s;ieged by troops, who &s;eemed willing to dare every thing, and to &s;uffer patiently any hard&s;hips in pur&s;uit of victory. The &s;trength of the fortre&s;s, however, with&s;tood their attack, and this, with the vigorous defence of the garri&s;on and the &s;carcity of provi&s;ion on the&s;e wild mountains, &s;oon compelled the a&s;&s;ailants to rai&s;e the &s;iege.</P>
<P>When Udolpho was once more left to the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Montoni, he di&s;patched Ugo into Tu&s;cany for Emily, whom he

had &s;ent from con&s;iderations of her per&s;onal &s;afety, to a place of greater &s;ecurity, than a ca&s;tle, which was, at that time, liable to be overrun by his enemies. Tranquillity being once more re&s;tor|ed to Udolpho, he was impatient to &s;ecure her again under his roof, and had commi&s;&s;ioned Ugo to a&s;&s;i&s;t Bertrand in guarding her back to the ca&s;tle. Thus compelled to return, Emily bade the kind Maddelina farewel, with regret, and, after about a fort|night's &s;tay in Tu&s;cany, where &s;he had experienced an interval of quiet, which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain her long hara&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, began once more to a&s;cend the Apennines, from who&s;e heights &s;he gave a long and &s;orrowful look to the beauti|ful country, that extended at their feet, and to the di&s;tant Mediter|ranean, who&s;e waves &s;he had &s;o often wi&s;hed would bear her back to France. The di&s;tre&s;s &s;he felt, on her return towards the place of her former &s;ufferings, was, however, &s;oftened by a conjecture, that Valancourt was there, and &s;he found &s;ome degree of com|fort in the thought of being near him, notwith&s;tanding the con|&s;ideration, that he was probably a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>It was noon, when &s;he had left the cottage, and the evening was clo&s;ed long before &s;he came within the neighbourhood of Udolpho. There was a moon, but it &s;hone only at intervals, for the night was cloudy, and lighted by the torch, which Ugo car|ried, the travellers paced &s;ilently along. Emily mu&s;ing on her &s;ituation, and Bertrand and Ugo anticipating the comforts of a fla&s;k of wine and a good fire, for they had perceived for &s;ome time the difference between the warm climate of the lowlands of Tu&s;cany and the nipping air of the&s;e upper regions. Emily was, at length, rou&s;ed from her reverie by the far off &s;ound of the ca&s;tle clock, to which &s;he li&s;tened not without &s;ome degree of awe, as it rolled away on the breeze. Another and another note &s;ucceeded, and died in &s;ullen murmur among the moun|tains:&mdash;to her mournful imagination it &s;eemed a knell mea&s;ur|ing out &s;ome fatal period for her.</P>
<P>"Aye, there is the old clock," &s;aid Bertrand, "there he is &s;till; the cannon have not &s;ilenced him!"</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered Ugo, "he crowed as loud as the be&s;t of them in the mid&s;t of it all. There he was roaring out in the hotte&s;t fire I have &s;een this many a day! I &s;aid that &s;ome of them would have a hit at the old fellow, but he e&s;caped, and the tow|er too."</P>
<P>The road winding round the ba&s;e of a mountain, they now came within view of the ca&s;tle, which was &s;hewn in the per|&s;pective of the valley by a gleam of moon&s;hine, and then vani&s;h|ed
<PB N="207" REF="029378_0217_0FE084925B1C6248">
in &s;hade; while even a tran&s;ient view of it had awak|ened the poignancy of Emily's feelings. Its ma&s;&s;y and gloomy walls gave her terrible ideas of impri&s;onment and &s;uffer|ing: yet, as &s;he advanced, &s;ome degree of hope mingled with her terror; for, though this was certainly the re&s;idence of Mon|toni, it was po&s;&s;ibly, al&s;o, that of Valancourt, and &s;he could not approach a place, where he might be, without experiencing &s;omewhat of the joy of hope.</P>
<P>They continued to wind along the valley, and, &s;oon after, &s;he &s;aw again the old walls and moonlight towers, ri&s;ing over the woods: the &s;trong rays enabled her, al&s;o, to perceive the rava|ges, which the &s;iege had made,&mdash;with the broken walls, and &s;hattered battlements, for they were now at the foot of the &s;teep, on which Udolpho &s;tood. Ma&s;&s;y fragments had rolled down among the woods, through which the travellers now began to a&s;cend, and there mingled with the loo&s;e earth, and pieces of rock they had brought with them. The woods, too, had &s;uffer|ed much from the batteries above, for here the enemy had en|deavoured to &s;creen them&s;elves from the fire of the ramparts. Many noble trees were levelled with the ground, and others to a wide extent, were entirely &s;tripped of their upper branches. "We had better di&s;mount," &s;aid Ugo, "and lead the mules up the hill, or we &s;hall get into &s;ome of the holes, which the balls have left. Here are plenty of them. Give me the torch," con|tinued Ugo, after they had di&s;mounted, "and take care you don't &s;tumble over any thing, that lies in your way, for the ground is not yet cleared of the enemy."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed Emily, "are any of the enemy here, then?"</P>
<P>"Nay, I don't know for that, now," he replied, "but when I came away I &s;aw one or two of them lying under the trees."</P>
<P>As they proceeded, the torch threw a gloomy light upon the ground, and far among the rece&s;&s;es of the woods, and Emily fear|ed to look forward, left &s;ome object of horror &s;hould meet her eye. The path was often &s;trewn with broken heads of arrows, and with &s;hattered remains of armour, &s;uch as at that period was mingled with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ghter dre&s;s of the &s;oldiers. "Bring the light hither," &s;aid Bertrand, "I have &s;tumbled over &s;omething, that rattles loud enough." Ugo holding up the torch, they perceiv|ed a &s;teel brea&s;tplate on the ground, which Bertrand rai&s;ed, and they &s;aw, that it was pierced through, and that the lining was entirely covered with blood; but upon Emily's earne&s;t entrea|ties, that they would proceed, Bertrand, uttering &s;ome joke upon the unfortunate per&s;on, to whom it had belonged, threw it hard upon the ground, and they pa&s;&s;ed on.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="029378_0218_0FE08496F425F9C0">
At every &s;tep &s;he took, Emily feared to &s;ee &s;ome ve&s;tige of death. Coming &s;oon after to an opening in the woods, Ber|trand &s;topped to &s;urvey the ground, which was encumbered with ma&s;&s;y trunks and branches of the trees, that had &s;o lately adorn|ed it, and &s;eemed to have been a &s;pot particularly fatal to the be&s;iegers; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was evident from the de&s;truction of the trees, that here the hotte&s;t fire of the garri&s;on had been directed. As Ugo held again forth the torch, &s;teel glittered between the fallen trees&punc; the ground beneath was covered with broken arms, and with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ve&s;tments of &s;oldiers, who&s;e mangled forms Emily almo&s;t expected to &s;ee; and &s;he again entreated her companions to pro|ceed, who were, however, too intent in their examination, to regard her, and &s;he turned her eyes from this de&s;olated &s;cene to the ca&s;tle above, where &s;he ob&s;erved lights gliding along the ramparts. Pre&s;ently, the ca&s;tle clock &s;truck twelve, and then a trumpet &s;ounded, of which Emily inquired the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>"O! they are only changing watch," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ugo. "I do not remember this trumpet," &s;aid Emily, "it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cu&s;tom." "It is only an old one revived, lady; we always u&s;e it in time of war. We have &s;ounded it, at midnight, ever &s;ince the place was be|&s;ieged."</P>
<P>"Hark!" &s;aid Emily, as the trumpet &s;ounded again; and, in the next moment, &s;he heard a faint cla&s;h of arms, and then the watchword pa&s;&s;ed along the terrace above, and was an&s;wered from a di&s;tant part of the ca&s;tle; after which all was again &s;till. She complained of cold, and begged to go on. "Pre&s;ently, lady," &s;aid Bertrand, turning over &s;ome broken arms with the pike he u&s;ually carried. "What have we here?"</P>
<P>"Hark!" cried Emily, "what noi&s;e was that?"</P>
<P>"What noi&s;e was it?" &s;aid Ugo, &s;tarting up and li&s;tening.</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" repeated Emily. "It &s;urely came from the ram|parts above:" and, on looking up, they perceived a light mov|ing along the walls, while, in the next in&s;tant, the breeze &s;well|ing, the voice &s;ounded louder than before.</P>
<P>"Who goes yonder?" cried a &s;entinel of the ca&s;tle. "Speak, or it will be wor&s;e for you." Bertrand uttered a &s;hout of joy. "Ah! my brave comrade, is it you?" &s;aid he, and he blew a &s;hrill whi&s;tle, which &s;ignal was an&s;wered by another from the &s;oldier on watch; and the party, then pa&s;&s;ing forward, &s;oon af|ter emerged from the woods upon the broken road, that led im|mediately to the ca&s;tle gates, and Emily &s;aw, with renewed ter|ror, the whole of that &s;tupendous &s;tructure. "Alas!" &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "I am going again into my pri&s;on!"</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="029378_0218_0FE08496F425F9C0">
"Here has been warm work, by St. Marco!" cried Bertrand, waving the torch over the ground; "the balls have torn up the earth here, with a vengeance."</P>
<P>"Aye," replied Ugo, "they were fired from that redoubt, yonder, and rare execution they did. The enemy made a furi|ous attack upon the great gates; but they might have gue&s;&s;ed they could never carry it there; for, be&s;ides the cannon from the walls, our archers, on the two round towers, &s;howered down upon them at &s;uch a rate, that, by holy Peter! there was no &s;tanding it. I never &s;aw a better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight in my life; I laughed, till my &s;ides ached, to &s;ee how the knaves &s;campered. Bertrand, my good fellow, thou &s;hould&s;t have been among them; I war|rant thou would&s;t have won the race!"</P>
<P>"Hah! you are at your old tricks again," &s;aid Bertrand in a &s;urly tone. "It is well for thee thou art &s;o near the ca&s;tle; thou knowe&s;t I have killed my man before now." Ugo replied only by a laugh, and then gave &s;ome further account of the &s;iege, to which as Emily li&s;tened, &s;he was &s;truck by the &s;trong con|tra&s;t of the pre&s;ent &s;cene with that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o lately been acted here.</P>
<P>The mingled uproar of cannon, drums, and trumpets, the groans of the conquered, and the &s;houts of the conquerers were now funk into a &s;ilence &s;o profound, that it &s;eemed as if death had triumphed alike over the vanqui&s;hed and the victor. The &s;hattered condition of one of the towers of the great gates by no means confirmed the <HI>valiant</HI> account ju&s;t given by Ugo of the &s;campering party, who, it was evident, had not only made a &s;tand, but had done much mi&s;chief before they took to flight; for this tower appeared, as far as Emily could judge by the dim moonlight that fell upon it, to be laid open, and the battlements were nearly demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>While &s;he gazed, a light glimmered through one of the lower loopholes, and di&s;appeared; but, in the next moment, &s;he perceived through the broken wall, a &s;oldier, with a lamp, a&s;cending the nar|row &s;tairca&s;e, that wound within the tower, and, remembering that it was the &s;ame &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed up, on the night when Barnardine had deluded her with a promi&s;e of &s;eeing Madame Montoni, fancy gave her &s;omewhat of the terror &s;he had then &s;uffered. She was now very near the gates, over which the &s;oldier having opened the door of the portal chamber, the lamp he carried gave her a du&s;ky view of that terrible apartment, and &s;he almo&s;t &s;unk under the recollected horrors of the moment, when &s;he had drawn a&s;ide the curtain, and di&s;covered the object it was meant to conceal.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029378_0219_0FE0846E6CC332B0">
"Perhaps," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "it is now u&s;ed for a &s;imilar purpo&s;e; perhaps, that &s;oldier goes, at this dead hour, to watch over the corp&s;e of his friend!" The little remains of her for|titude now gave way to the united force of remembered and an|ticipated horrors, for the melancholy fate of Madame Montoni appeared to foretell her own. She con&s;idered, that, though the Languedoc e&s;tates, if &s;he relinqui&s;hed them, would &s;atisfy Mon|toni's avarice, they might not appea&s;e his vengeance, which was &s;eldom pacified but by a terrible &s;acrifice; and &s;he even thought, that, were &s;he to re&s;ign them, the fear of ju&s;tice might urge him either to detain her a pri&s;oner or to take away her life.</P>
<P>They were now arrived at the gates, where Bertrand, ob&s;erv|ing the light glimmer through a &s;mall ca&s;ement of the portal chamber, called aloud, and the &s;oldier looking out, demanded who was there. "Here, I have brought you a pri&s;oner," &s;aid Ugo, "open the gate and let us in."</P>
<P>"Tell me fir&s;t, who it is that demands entrance," replied the &s;oldier. "What! my old comrade," cried Ugo, "don't you know me? not know Ugo? I have brought home a pri&s;oner here, bound hand and foot&mdash;a fellow, who has been drinking Tu&s;|cany wine, while we here have been fighting."</P>
<P>"You will not re&s;t till you meet with your match," &s;aid Bertrand &s;ullenly. "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">! my comrade, is it you?" &s;aid the &s;oldier&mdash;"I'll be with you directly."</P>
<P>Emily pre&s;ently heard his &s;teps de&s;cending the &s;tairs within, and then the heavy chain fall, and the bolts undraw of a &s;mall po&s;tern door, which he opened to admit the party. He held the lamp low, to &s;hew the &s;tep of the gate, and &s;he found her&s;elf once more beneath the gloomy arch, and heard the door clo&s;e, that &s;eemed to &s;hut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the world for ever. In the next moment, &s;he was in the fir&s;t court of the ca&s;tle, where &s;he &s;ur|veyed the &s;pacious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;olitary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ea, with a kind of calm de&s;|pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> while the dead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the night, the gothic gloom of the &s;urrounding buildings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the hollow and imperfect echoes, which they returned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ugo and the &s;oldier conver&s;ed together, a&s;&s;i&s;ted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the melancholy forebodings of her heart.

"Why, you have got &s;ome Tu&s;cany wine among you, <HI>here,</HI>" &s;aid Bertrand, "if one may judge by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> is going forward. Ugo has taken a larger &s;hare of that than of fighting, I'll be &s;worn. Who is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at this late hour!"</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="029378_0219_0FE0846E6CC332B0">
"His <HI>Excellenza</HI> and the Signors," replied the &s;oldier: it is a &s;ign you are a &s;tranger at the ca&s;tle, or you would not need to a&s;k the que&s;tion. They are brave &s;pirits, that do without &s;leep&mdash;they generally pa&s;s the night in good cheer; would that we, who keep the watch, had a little of it! It is cold work, pacing the ramparts &s;o many hours of the night, if one has no good li|quor to warm one's heart."</P>
<P>"Courage, my lad, courage ought to warm your heart," &s;aid Ugo. "Courage!" replied the &s;oldier &s;harply, with a mena|cing air, which Ugo perceiving, prevented his &s;aying more, by returning to the &s;ubject of the carou&s;al. "This is a new cu&s;|tom," &s;aid he; "when I left the ca&s;tle, the Signors u&s;ed to &s;it up coun&s;elling."</P>
<P>"Aye, and for that matter, carou&s;ing too," replied Ugo, "but, &s;ince the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iege, they have done nothing but make merry; and if I was they. I would &s;ettle accounts with my&s;elf, for all my hard fighting, the &s;ame way."</P>
<P>They had now cro&s;&s;ed the &s;econd court, and reached the hall door, when the &s;oldier, bidding them good night, ha&s;tened back to his po&s;t; and, while they waited for admittance, Emily con&s;idered how &s;he might avoid &s;eeing Montoni, and retire un|noticed to her former apartment, for &s;he &s;hrunk from the thought of encountering either him or any of his party, at this hour. The uproar within the ca&s;tle was now &s;o loud, that, though Ugo knocked repeatedly at the hall door, he was not heard by any of the &s;ervants, a circum&s;tance, which increa&s;ed Emily's alarm, while it allowed her time to deliberate on the means of retiring unob&s;erved; for, though &s;he might, perhaps, pa&s;s up the great &s;tairca&s;e un&s;een, it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could find the way to her chamber, without a light, the difficulty of procuring which, and the danger of wandering about the ca&s;tle, without one, immediately &s;truck her. Bertrand had only a torch, and &s;he knew, that the &s;ervants never brought a taper to the door, for the hall was &s;ufficiently lighted by the large tripod lamp, which hung in the vaulted roof; and, while &s;he &s;hould wait till Annette could bring a taper, Montoni, or &s;ome of his companions, might di&s;cover her.</P>
<P>The door was now opened by Carlo; and Emily, having re|que&s;ted him to &s;end Annette immediately with a light to the great gallery, where &s;he determined to await her, pa&s;&s;ed on with ha&s;ty &s;teps towards the &s;tairca&s;e; while Bertrand and Ugo, with the torch, followed old Carlo to the &s;ervants' hall, impatient for &s;upper and the warm blaze of a wood fire. Emily, lighted only
<PB N="212" REF="029378_0220_0FE084A835C6F7C0">
by the feeble rays, which the lamp above threw between the arches of this exten&s;ive hall, endeavoured to find her way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tairca&s;e, now hid in ob&s;curity; while the &s;houts of merriment, that bur&s;t from a remote apartment, &s;erved, by heightening her terror, to increa&s;e her perplexity, and &s;he expected, every in&s;tant, to &s;ee the door of that room open, and Montoni and his com|panions i&s;&s;ue forth. Having, at length, reached the &s;tairca&s;e, and found her way to the top, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on the la&s;t &s;tair, to await the arrival of Annette; for the profound darkne&s;s of the gallery deterred her from proceeding farther, and, while &s;he li&s;|tened for her foot&s;tep, &s;he heard only di&s;tant &s;ounds of revelry, which ro&s;e in &s;ullen echoes from among the arcades below. Once &s;he thought &s;he heard a low &s;ound from the dark gallery behind her; and, turning her eyes, fancied &s;he &s;aw &s;omething luminous move in it; and, &s;ince &s;he could not, at this moment, &s;ubdue the weakne&s;s that cau&s;ed her fears, &s;he quitted her &s;eat, and crept &s;oftly down a few &s;tairs lower.</P>
<P>Annette not yet appearing, Emily now concluded, that &s;he was gone to bed, and that nobody cho&s;e to call her up; and the pro&s;pect, that pre&s;ented it&s;elf, of pa&s;&s;ing the night in darkne&s;s, in this place, or in &s;ome other equally forlorn (for &s;he knew it would be impracticable to find her way through the intracies of the galleries to her chamber) drew tears of mingled terror and de&s;pondency from her eyes.</P>
<P>While thus &s;he &s;at, &s;he fancied &s;he heard again an odd &s;ound from the gallery, and &s;he li&s;tened, &s;carcely daring to breathe, but the increa&s;ing voices below overcame every other &s;ound. Soon after, &s;he heard Montoni and his companions bur&s;t into the hall, who &s;poke, as if they were much intoxicated, and &s;eemed to be advancing towards the &s;tairca&s;e. She now remembered, that they mu&s;t come this way to their chambers, and, forgetting all the terrors of the gallery, hurried towards it wi&s;h an intention of &s;ecreting her&s;elf in &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages, that opened beyond, and of endeavouring, when the Signors were retired, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> find her way to her own room, or to that of Annette, which was in a remote part of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>With extended arms, &s;he crept along the gallery, &s;till hearing the voices of per&s;ons below, who &s;eemed to &s;top in conver&s;ation at the foot of the &s;tairca&s;e, and then pau&s;ing for a moment to li&s;ten, half fearful of going further into the darkne&s;s of the galle|ry, where &s;he &s;till imagined, from the noi&s;e &s;he had heard, that &s;ome per&s;on was lurking, "They are already informed of my arrival," &s;aid &s;he, "and Montoni is coming him&s;elf to &s;eek me!
<PB N="213" REF="029378_0220_0FE084A835C6F7C0">
In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his mind, his purpo&s;e mu&s;t be de&s;perate." Then, recollecting the &s;cene, that had pa&s;&s;ed in the corridor, on the night preceding her departure from the ca&s;tle, "O Va|lancourt!" &s;aid &s;he, "I mu&s;t then re&s;ign you for ever. To brave any longer the inju&s;tice of Montoni, would not be fortitude, but ra&s;hne&s;s." Still the voices below did not draw nearer, but they became louder, and &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e of Verezzi and Bertolini above the re&s;t, while the few words &s;he caught made her li&s;ten more anxiou&s;ly for others. The conver&s;ation &s;eemed to concern her&s;elf; and, having ventured to &s;tep a few paces nearer to the &s;tairca&s;e, &s;he di&s;covered, that they were di&s;puting about her, each &s;eeming to claim &s;ome former promi&s;e of Montoni, who appeared, at fir&s;t, inclined to appea&s;e and to per&s;uade them to re|turn to their wine, but afterwards to be weary of the di&s;pute, and, &s;aying that he left them to &s;ettle it as they could, was returning with the re&s;t of the party to the apartment he had ju&s;t quitted. Verezzi then &s;topped him. "Where is &s;he? Signor," &s;aid he, in a voice of impatience: "tell us where &s;he is." "I have al|ready told you that I do not know," replied Montoni, who &s;eem|ed to be &s;omewhat overcome with wine; "but &s;he is mo&s;t pro|bably gone to her apartment." Verezzi and Bertolini now de|&s;i&s;ted from their inquiries, and &s;prang to the &s;tairca&s;e together, while Emily, who, during this di&s;cour&s;e, had trembled &s;o exce&s;|&s;ively, that &s;he had with difficulty &s;upported her&s;elf, &s;eemed in|&s;pired with new &s;trength, the moment &s;he heard the bound of their &s;teps and ran along the gallery, dark as it was, with the fleetne&s;s of a fawn. But, long before &s;he reached its extremity, the light, which Verezzi carried, fla&s;hed upon the walls; both appeared, and, in&s;tantly perceiving Emily, pur&s;ued her. At this moment, Bertolini, who&s;e &s;teps though &s;wift, were not &s;teady, and who&s;e impatience overcame what little caution he had hith|erto u&s;ed, &s;tumbled, and fell at his length. The lamp fell with him, and was pre&s;ently expiring on the floor; but Verezzi, re|gardle&s;s of &s;aving it, &s;eized the advantage this accident gave him over his rival, and followed Emily, to whom, however, the light had &s;hone one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he pa&s;&s;ages that branched from the gal|lery, and &s;he in&s;tantly turned into it. Verezzi could ju&s;t di&s;cern the way, &s;he had taken, and this he pur&s;ued; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound of her &s;teps &s;oon &s;unk in di&s;tance, while he, le&s;s acquainted with the pa&s;&s;age, was obliged to proceed through the dark, with cau|tion, le&s;t he &s;hould fall down a flight of &s;teps, &s;uch as in this ex|ten&s;ive old ca&s;tle frequently terminated an avenue. This pa&s;|&s;age at length brought Emily to the corridor, into which her own
<PB N="214" REF="029378_0221_0FE084B7863BEAB0">
chamber opened, and, not hearing any foot&s;tep, &s;he pau&s;ed to take breath, and con&s;ider what was the &s;afe&s;t de&s;ign to be adopted. She had followed this pa&s;&s;age, merely becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t that appeared, and now that &s;he had reached the end of it, was as perplexed as before. Whither to go, or how fur|ther to find her way in the dark, &s;he knew not; &s;he was aware only that &s;he mu&s;t not &s;eek her apartment, for there &s;he would certainly be &s;ought, and her danger increa&s;ed every in&s;tant, while &s;he remained near it. Her &s;pirits and her breath, how|ever, were &s;o much exhau&s;ted, that &s;he was compelled to re&s;t, for a few minutes, at the end of the pa&s;&s;age, and &s;till &s;he heard no &s;teps approaching. As thus &s;he &s;tood, light glimmered under an oppo&s;ite door of the gallery, and, from its &s;ituation, &s;he knew, that it was the door of that my&s;terious chamber, where &s;he had made a di&s;covery &s;o &s;hocking, that &s;he never remembered it but with the utmo&s;t horror. That there &s;hould be light in this chamber, and at this hour, excited her &s;trong &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;he felt a momentary terror concering it, which did not permit her to look again, for her &s;pirits were now in &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of weak|ne&s;s, that &s;he almo&s;t expected to &s;ee the door &s;lowly open, and &s;ome horrible object appear at it. Still &s;he li&s;tened for a &s;tep along the pa&s;&s;age, and looked up it, where not a ray of light ap|pearing, &s;he concluded, that Verezzi had gone back for the lamp; and, believing that he would &s;hortly be there, &s;he again con&s;idered which way &s;he &s;hould go, or rather which way &s;he could find in the dark.</P>
<P>A faint ray &s;till glimmered under the oppo&s;ite door, but &s;o great, and, perhaps, &s;o ju&s;t was her horror of that chamber, that &s;he would not again have tempted its &s;ecrets, though &s;he had been certain of obtaining the light &s;o important to her &s;afety. She was &s;till breathing with difficulty, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ting at the end of the pa&s;&s;age, when &s;he heard a ru&s;tling &s;ound, and then a low voice, &s;o very near her, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eemed clo&s;e to her ear; but &s;he had pre&s;ence of mind to check her emotions, and to remain quite &s;till; in the next moment, &s;he perceived it to be the voice of Verezzi, who did not appear to know, that &s;he was there, but to have &s;poken to him&s;elf. "The air is fre&s;her here," &s;aid he: "this &s;hould be the corridor." Perhaps, he was one of tho&s;e heroes, who&s;e courage can defy an enemy better tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> darkne&s;s, and he tried to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;pirits with the &s;ound of his own voice. However this might be, he turned to the right, and proceeded, with the &s;ame &s;tealing &s;teps, towards Emily's apartment, appa|rently forgetting, that, in darkne&s;s, &s;he could ea&s;ily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">
<PB N="215" REF="029378_0221_0FE084B7863BEAB0">
&s;earch, even in her chamber; and, like an intoxicated per&s;on, he followed pertinaciou&s;ly the one idea, that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his imagination.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he heard his &s;teps &s;teal away, &s;he left her &s;ta|tion and moved &s;oftly to the other end of the corridor, deter|mined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to chance, and to quit it by the fir&s;t avenue &s;he could find; but, before &s;he could effect this, light broke up|on the walls of the gallery, and, looking back, &s;he &s;aw Verezzi cro&s;&s;ing it towards her chamber. She now glided into a pa&s;&s;age, that opened on the left, without, as &s;he thought, being perceiv|ed; but in the next in&s;tant, another light, glimmering at the further end of this pa&s;&s;age, threw her into new terror. While &s;he &s;topped and he&s;itated which way to go, the pau&s;e allowed her to perceive, that it was Annette who advanced, and &s;he hurried to meet her: but her imprudence again alarmed Emily, on per|ceiving whom, &s;he bur&s;t into a &s;cream of joy, and it was &s;ome minutes, before &s;he could be prevailed with to be &s;ilent, or to relea&s;e her mi&s;tre&s;s from the ardent cla&s;p, in which &s;he held her. When, at length, Emily made Annette comprehend her danger, they hurried towards Annette's room, which was in a di&s;tant part of the ca&s;tle. No apprehen&s;ions, however, could yet &s;ilence the latter. "Oh dear ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, as they pa&s;&s;ed a|long, "what a terrified time have I had of it! Oh! I thought I &s;hould have died an hundred times! I never thought I &s;hould live to &s;ee you again! and I never was &s;o glad to &s;ee any body in my whole life, as I am to &s;ee you now." "Hark!" cried Emily, "we are pur&s;ued; that was the echo of &s;teps!" "No, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "it was only the echo of a door &s;hut|ting; &s;ound runs along the&s;e vaulted pa&s;&s;ages &s;o, that one is continually deceived by it; if one does but &s;peak, or cough, it makes a noi&s;e as loud as a cannon." "Then there is the greater nece&s;&s;ity for us to be &s;ilent," &s;aid Emily: "pr'ythee &s;ay no more, till we reach your chamber." Here, at length, they ar|rived, without interruption, and Annette having fa&s;tened the door, Emily &s;at down on her little bed, to recover breath and compo&s;ure. To her inquiry, whether Valancourt was among the pri&s;oners in the ca&s;tle, Annette replied, that &s;he had not been able to hear, but that &s;he knew there were &s;everal per&s;ons con|fined. She then proceeded, in her tedious way, to give an ac|count of the &s;iege, or rather a detail of her terrors and various &s;ufferings, during the attack. "But, added &s;he, "when I heard the &s;houts of victory from the ramparts, I thought we were all taken, and gave my&s;elf up for lo&s;t, in&s;tead of which, <HI>we</HI> had
<PB N="216" REF="029378_0222_0FE084BC1E2A59E0">
driven the enemy away. I went then to the north gallery, and &s;aw a great many of them &s;campering away among the moun|tains; but the rampart walls were all in ruins, as one may &s;ay, and there was a di&s;mal &s;ight to &s;ee down among the woods be|low, where the poor fellows were lying in heaps, but were car|ried off pre&s;ently by their comrades. While the &s;iege was go|ing on, the Signor was here, and there, and every where, at the &s;ame time, as Ludovico told me, for he would not let me &s;ee any thing hardly, and locked me up, as he has often done before, in a room in the middle of the ca&s;tle, and u&s;ed to bring me food, and come and talk with me as often as he could; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, if it had not been for Ludovico, I &s;hould have died outright."</P>
<P>"Well, Annette," &s;aid Emily, "and how have affairs gone on, &s;ince the &s;iege?"</P>
<P>"O! &s;ad hurly burly doings, ma'am&s;elle," replied Annette; "the Signors have done nothing but &s;it and drink and game, ever &s;ince. They &s;it up, all night, and play among them&s;elves, for all tho&s;e riches and fine things, they brought in, &s;ometime &s;ince, when they u&s;ed to go out a robbing, or as good, for days together; and then they have dreadful quarrels about, who lo&s;es, and who wins. That fierce Signor Verezzi is always lo&s;ing, as they tell me, and Signor Or&s;ino wins from him, and this makes him very wroth, and they have had &s;everal hard &s;et-to's about it. Then, all tho&s;e fine ladies are at the ca&s;tle &s;till; and I declare I am frighted, whenever I meet any of them in the pa&s;&s;ages."</P>
<P>"Surely, Annette," &s;aid Emily, &s;tarting, "I heard a noi&s;e: li&s;ten." After a long pau&s;e, "No, Ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "it was only the wind in the gallery; I often hear it, when it &s;hakes the old doors, at the other end. But won't you go to bed, ma'am&s;elle? you &s;urely will not &s;it up &s;tarving, all night." Emily now laid her&s;elf down on the mattre&s;s, and de&s;ired Annette to leave the lamp burning on the hearth: having done which, the latter placed her&s;elf be&s;ide Emily, who, however, was not &s;uffered to &s;leep, for &s;he again thought &s;he heard a noi&s;e from the pa&s;&s;age; and Annette was again trying to convince her, that it was only the wind, when foot&s;teps were di&s;tinctly heard near the door. Annette was now &s;tarting from the bed, but Emily pre|vailed with her to remain there, and li&s;tened with her in a &s;tate of terrible expectation. The &s;teps &s;till loitered at the door, when pre&s;ently an attempt was made on the lock, and, in the next in&s;tant, a voice called. "For heaven's &s;ake, Annette, do not an&s;wer," &s;aid Emily &s;oftly, "remain quite &s;till; but I fear we mu&s;t extingui&s;h the lamp, or its glare will betray us." "Ho|ly
<PB N="217" REF="029378_0222_0FE084BC1E2A59E0">
Virgin!" exclaimed Annette, forgetting her di&s;cretion, "I would not be in darkne&s;s now for the whole world." While &s;he &s;poke, the voice became louder than before, and repeated An|nette's name; "Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin!" cried &s;he &s;uddenly, "it is only Ludovico." She ro&s;e to open the door, but Emily prevented her, till they &s;hould be more certain, that it was he alone; with whom Annette, at length, talked for &s;ometime, and learned, that he was come to inquire after her&s;elf, whom he had let out of her room to go to Emily, and that he was now returned to lock her in again. Emily, fearful of being overheard, if they conver&s;ed any longer through the door, con&s;ented that it &s;hould be opened, and a young man appeared, who&s;e open countenance confirmed the favourable opinion of him, which his care of An|nette had already prompted her to form. She intreated his pro|tection, &s;hould Verezzi make this requi&s;ite; and Ludovico of|fered to pa&s;s the night in an old chamber, adjoining, that opened from the gallery, and, on the fir&s;t alarm, to come to their defence.</P>
<P>Emily was much &s;oothed by this propo&s;al; and Ludovico, having lighted his lamp, went to his &s;tation, while &s;he, once more, endeavoured to repo&s;e on her mattre&s;s. But a variety of intere&s;ts pre&s;&s;ed upon her attention, and prevented &s;leep. She thought much on what Annette had told her of the di&s;&s;olute manners of Montoni and his a&s;&s;ociates, and more of his pre&s;ent conduct towards her&s;elf, and of the danger, from which &s;he had ju&s;t e&s;caped. From the view of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation &s;he &s;hrunk, as from a new picture of terror. She &s;aw her&s;elf in a ca&s;tle, inhab|ited by vice and violence, &s;eated beyond the reach of law, or ju&s;tice, and in the power of a man, who&s;e per&s;everance was equal to every occa&s;ion, and in whom pa&s;&s;ions, of which revenge was not the weake&s;t, entirely &s;upplied the place of principles. She was compelled, once more, to acknowledge, that it would be fol|ly, and not fortitude, any longer to dare his power; and, re&s;ign|ing all hopes of future happine&s;s with Valancourt, &s;he determin|ed, that, on the following morning, &s;he would compromi&s;e with Montoni, and give up her e&s;tates, on condition, that he would permit her immediate return to France. Such con&s;iderations kept her waking for many hours; but, the night pa&s;&s;ed without further alarm from Verezzi.</P>
<P>On the next morning, Emily had a long conver&s;ation with Ludovico, in which &s;he heard circum&s;tances concering the ca&s;tle, and received hints of the de&s;igns of Montoni, that con&s;iderably increa&s;ed her alarms. On expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urpri&s;e, that Ludovico, who &s;eemed to be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the evils of his &s;ituation, &s;hould continue in it, he informed her, that it was not his intention to do
<PB N="218" REF="029378_0223_0FE084C831B36380">
&s;o, and &s;he then ventured to a&s;k him, if he would a&s;&s;i&s;t her to e&s;cape from the ca&s;tle. Ludovico a&s;&s;ured her of his readine&s;s to attempt this, but &s;trongly repre&s;ented the difficulty of the enter|pri&s;e, and the certain de&s;truction which mu&s;t en&s;ue, &s;hould Mon|toni overtake them, before they had pa&s;&s;ed the mountains; he, however, promi&s;ed to be watchful of every circum&s;tance, that might contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of the attempt, and to think up|on &s;ome plan of departure.</P>
<P>Emily now confided to him the name of Valancourt, and beg|ged he would inquire for &s;uch a per&s;on among the pri&s;oners in the ca&s;tle; for the faint hope, which this conver&s;ation awakened, made her now recede from her re&s;olution of an immediate com|promi&s;e with Montoni. She determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to delay this, till &s;he heard further from Ludovico, and, if his de&s;igns were found to be impracticable, to re&s;ign the e&s;tates at once.&mdash;Her thoughts were on this &s;ubject, when Montoni, was now reco|vered from the intoxication of the preceding night, &s;ent for her, and &s;he immediately obeyed the &s;ummons. He was alone. "I find," &s;aid he, "that you were not in your chamber, la&s;t night; where were you?" Emily related to him &s;ome circum&s;tances of her alarm, and entreated his protection from a repetition of them. "You know the terms of my protection," &s;aid he; "if you real|ly value this, you will &s;ecure it." His open declaration, that he would only conditionally protect her, while &s;he remained a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle, &s;hewed Emily the nece&s;&s;ity of an imme|diate compliance with his terms; but &s;he fir&s;t demanded, whether he would permit her immediately to depart, if &s;he gave up her claim to the conte&s;ted e&s;tates. In a very &s;olemn manner he then a&s;&s;ured her, that he would, and immediately laid before her a paper, which was to transfer the right of tho&s;e e&s;tates to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>She was, for a con&s;iderable time, unable to &s;ign it, and her heart was torn with contending intere&s;ts, for &s;he was about to re&s;ign the happine&s;s of all her future years&mdash;the hope, which had &s;u&s;tained her in &s;o many hours of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>After hearing from Montoni a recapitulation of the conditions of her compliance, and a remon&s;trance, that his time was valu|able, &s;he put her hand to the paper; when &s;he had done which, &s;he fell back in her chair, but &s;oon recovered, and de&s;ired, that he would give orders for her departure, and that he would allow Annette to accompany her. Montoni &s;miled. "It was nece&s;|&s;ary to deceive you," &s;aid he&mdash;"there was no other way of making you act rea&s;onably; you &s;hall go, but it mu&s;t not be at pre&s;ent. I mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;ecure the&s;e e&s;tates by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: when that is done, you may return to France if you will."</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="029378_0223_0FE084C831B36380">
The deliberate villainy, with which he violated the &s;olemn engagement he had ju&s;t entered into, &s;hocked Emily as much, as the certainty, that &s;he had made a fruitle&s;s &s;acrifice, and mu&s;t &s;till remain his pri&s;oner. She had no words to expre&s;s what &s;he felt, and knew, that it would have been u&s;ele&s;s, if &s;he had. As &s;he looked piteou&s;ly at Montoni, he turned away, and at the &s;ame time de&s;ired &s;he would withdraw to her apartment; but, unable to leave the room, &s;he &s;at down in a chair near the door, and &s;ighed heavily. She had neither words nor tears.</P>
<P>"Why will you indulge this childi&s;h grief?" &s;aid he. "En|deavour to &s;trengthen your mind, to bear patiently what cannot now be avoided; you have no real evil to lament; be patient, and you will be &s;ent back to France. At pre&s;ent retire to your apartment."</P>
<P>"I dare not go, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "where I &s;hall be liable to the intru&s;ion of Signor Verezzi." "Have I not promi&s;ed to protect you?" &s;aid Montoni. "You have promi&s;ed &s;ir,"&mdash;replied Emily, after &s;ome he&s;itation. "And is not my promi&s;e &s;ufficient?" added he &s;ternly. "You will recollect your former promi&s;e, Signor," &s;aid Emily, trembling, "and may determine for me, whether I ought to rely upon this." "Will you pro|voke me to declare to you, that I will not protect you then?" &s;aid Montoni, in a tone of haughty di&s;plea&s;ure. "If that will &s;atisfy you, I will do it immediately. Withdraw to your cham|ber, before I retract my promi&s;e: you have nothing to fear there." Emily left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> room, and moved &s;lowly into the hall, where the fear of meeting Verezzi, or Bertolini, made her quicken her &s;teps, though &s;he could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf; and &s;oon af|ter &s;he reached once more her own apartment.&mdash;Having looked fearfully round her, to examine if any per&s;on was there, and having &s;earched every part of it, &s;he fa&s;tened the door, and &s;at down by one of the ca&s;ements. Here, while &s;he looked out for &s;ome hope to &s;upport her fainting &s;pirits, which had been &s;o long hara&s;&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed, that, if &s;he had not now &s;truggled much again&s;t misfortune, they would have left her, per|haps, for ever, &s;he endeavoured to believe, that Montoni did re|ally intend to permit her return to France as &s;oon as he had &s;ecured her property, and that he would, in the meantime, pro|tect her from in&s;ult; but her chief hope re&s;ted with Lodovico, who, &s;he doubted not, would be zealous in her cau&s;e, though he &s;eemed almo&s;t to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s in it. One circum&s;tance, however, &s;he had to rejoice in. Her prudence, or rather her fears, had &s;aved her from mentioning the name of Valancourt to
<PB N="220" REF="029378_0224_0FE084CCF1EC9420">
Montoni, which &s;he was &s;everal times on the point of doing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> before &s;he &s;igned the paper, and of &s;tipulating for his relea&s;e, if he &s;hould be really a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle. Had &s;he done this, Montoni's jealous fears would now probably have loaded Valan|court with new &s;everities, and have &s;ugge&s;ted the advantage of holding him a captive for life.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the melancholy day, as &s;he had before pa&s;&s;ed many in the &s;ame chamber. When night drew on, &s;he would have with|drawn her&s;elf to Annette's bed, had not a particular intere&s;t in|clined her to remain in this chamber, in &s;pite of her fears; for, when the ca&s;tle &s;hould be &s;till, and the cu&s;tomary hour arrived, &s;he determined to watch for the mu&s;ic, which &s;he had formerly heard. Though its &s;ounds might not enable her po&s;itively to determine, whether Valancourt was there, they would perhaps &s;trengthen her opinion that he was, and impart the comfort, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to her pre&s;ent &s;upport.&mdash;But, on the other hand, if all &s;hould be &s;ilent!&mdash;She hardly dared to &s;uffer her thoughts to glance that way, but waited, with impatient expectation the ap|proaching hour.</P>
<P>The night was &s;tormy; the battlements of the ca&s;tle appear|ed to rock in the wind, and, at intervals, long groans &s;eemed to pa&s;s on the air, &s;uch as tho&s;e, which often deceive the melancho|ly mind, in tempe&s;ts, and amid&s;t &s;cenes of de&s;olation. Emily heard as formerly, the &s;entinels pa&s;s along the terrace to their po&s;ts, and, looking out from her ca&s;ement, ob&s;erved, that the watch was doubled; a precaution, which appeared nece&s;&s;ary enough, when &s;he threw her eyes on the walls, and &s;aw their &s;hattered condition. The well known &s;ounds of the &s;oldiers' march, and of their di&s;tant voices, which pa&s;&s;ed her in the wind, and were lo&s;t again, recalled to her memory the melancholy &s;en|&s;ations &s;he had &s;uffered, when &s;he formerly heard the &s;ame &s;ounds and occa&s;ioned almo&s;t involuntary compari&s;ons between her pre|&s;ent, and her late &s;ituation. But this was no &s;ubject for con|gratulation, and &s;he wi&s;ely checked the cour&s;e of her thoughts, while, as the hour was not yet come, in which &s;he had been ac|cu&s;tomed to hear the mu&s;ic, &s;he clo&s;ed the ca&s;ement, and endea|voured to await it in patience. The door of the &s;tairca&s;e &s;he tried to &s;ecure, as u&s;ual, with &s;ome of the furniture of the room; but this expedient her fears now repre&s;ented to her to be very in|adequate to the power and per&s;everance of Verezzi; and &s;he of|ten looked at a large and heavy che&s;t, that &s;tood in the cham|ber, with wi&s;hes that &s;he and Annette had &s;trength enough to move it. While &s;he blamed the long &s;tay of this girl, who was
<PB N="221" REF="029378_0224_0FE084CCF1EC9420">
&s;till with Ludovico and &s;ome other of the &s;ervants, &s;he trimmed her wood fire, to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> room appear le&s;s de&s;olate, and &s;at down be&s;ide it with a book, which her eyes peru&s;ed, while her thoughts wandered to Valancourt, and her own misfortunes. As &s;he &s;at thus, &s;he thought, in a pau&s;e of the wind, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed mu&s;ic, and went to the ca&s;ement to li&s;ten, but the loud &s;well of the gu&s;t overcame every other &s;ound. When the wind &s;unk again, &s;he heard di&s;tinctly, in the deep pau&s;e that &s;ucceeded, the &s;weet &s;trings of a lute; but again the ri&s;ing tempe&s;t bore away the notes, and again was &s;ucceeded by a &s;olemn pau&s;e. Emily, trembling with hope and fear, opened her ca&s;ement to li&s;ten, and to try whe|ther her own voice could be heard by the mu&s;ician; for to en|dure any longer this &s;tate of torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e concerning Va|lancourt, &s;eemed to be utterly impo&s;&s;ible. There was a kind of breathle&s;s &s;tillne&s;s in the chambers, that permitted her to din&s;tin|gui&s;h from below the tender notes of the very lute &s;he had for|merly heard, and with it, a plaintive voice, made &s;weeter by the low ru&s;tling &s;ound, that now began to creep along the wood tops, till it was lo&s;t in the ri&s;ing wind. Their tall heads then began to wave, while, through a fore&s;t of pine, on the left, the wind, groaning heavily, rolled onward over the woods below, bending them almo&s;t to their roots; and, as the long re&s;ounding gale &s;wept away, other woods, on the right, &s;eemed to an&s;wer the "loud lament;" then, others, further &s;till, &s;oftened it into a murmur, that died into &s;ilence. Emily li&s;tened, with mingled awe and expectation, hope and fear; and again the melting &s;weetne&s;s of the lute was heard, and the &s;ame &s;olemn breathing voice. Convinced that the&s;e came from an apartment under|neath, &s;he leaned far out of her window, that &s;he might di&s;cover whether any light was there; but the ca&s;ements below, as well as tho&s;e above, were &s;unk &s;o deep in the thick walls of the ca&s;|tle, that &s;he could not &s;ee them, or even the faint ray, that prob|ably glimmered through their bars. She then ventured to call, but the wind bore her voice to the other end of the terrace, and then the mu&s;ic was heard as before, in the pau&s;e of the gu&s;t. Suddenly, &s;he thought &s;he heard a noi&s;e in her chamber, and &s;he drew her&s;elf within the ca&s;ement; but, in a moment after, di&s;|tingui&s;hing Annette's voice at the door, &s;he concluded it was her &s;he had heard before, and &s;he let her in. "Move &s;oftly, An|nette, to the ca&s;ement," &s;aid &s;he, "and li&s;ten with me; the mu|&s;ic is returned." They were &s;ilent till, the mea&s;ure changing, Annette exclaimed, "Holy Virgin! I know that &s;ong well; it is a French &s;ong, one of the favourite &s;ongs of my dear country."
<PB N="222" REF="029378_0225_0FE084DB53DD5F78">
This was the ballad Emily had heard on a former night, though not the one &s;he had fir&s;t li&s;tened to from the fi&s;hing hou&s;e in Ga&s;cony. "O! it is a Frenchman, that &s;ings," &s;aid Annette: "It mu&s;t be Mon&s;ieur Valancourt." "Hark! Annette, do not &s;peak &s;o loud," &s;aid Emily, "we may be overheard." "What! by the Chevalier?" &s;aid Annette. No," replied Emily mourn|fully, "but by &s;ome body, who may report us to the Signor. What rea&s;on have you to think it is Mon&s;ieur Valancourt, who &s;ings? But hark! now the voice &s;wells louder! Do you recollect tho&s;e tones? I fear to tru&s;t my own judgment." "I never happened to hear the Chevalier &s;ing, Mademoi&s;elle," replied Annette, who, as Emily was di&s;appointed to perceive, had no &s;tronger rea&s;on for concluding this to be Valancourt, than that the mu|&s;ician mu&s;t be a Frenchman. Soon after, &s;he heard the &s;ong of the fi&s;hing hou&s;e, and di&s;tingui&s;hed her own name, which was repeated &s;o di&s;tinctly, that Annette had heard it al&s;o. She trembled, &s;unk into a chair by the window, and Annette called aloud, "Mon&s;ieur Valancourt! Mon&s;ieur Valancourt!" while Emily endeavoured to check her, but &s;he repeated the call more loudly than before, and the lute, and the voice &s;uddenly &s;top|ped. Emily li&s;tened, for &s;ometime, in a &s;tate of intolerable &s;u&s;pen&s;e; but, no an&s;wer being returned, "It does not &s;ignify, mademoi&s;elle," &s;aid Annette; "it is the Chevalier, and I will &s;peak to him." "No, Annette," &s;aid Emily, "I think I will &s;peak my&s;elf; if it is he, he will know my voice, and &s;peak a|gain." "Who is it," &s;aid &s;he, "that &s;ings at this late hour?"</P>
<P>A long &s;ilence en&s;ued, and having repeated the que&s;tion, &s;he perceived &s;ome faint accents, mingling in the bla&s;t, that &s;wept by; but the &s;ounds were &s;o di&s;tant, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;uddenly, that &s;he could &s;carcely hear them, much le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;h the words they ut|tered, or recogni&s;e the voice. After another pau&s;e, Emily called again; and again they heard a voice, but as faintly as before; and they perceived, that there were other circum&s;tances, be&s;ides the &s;trength, and direction of the wind, to contend with; for the great depth, at which the ca&s;ements were fixed in the ca&s;tle walls, contributed, &s;till more than the di&s;tance, to prevent articulated &s;ounds from being under&s;tood, though general ones were ea&s;ily heard. Emily, however, ventured to believe, from the circum|&s;tance of her voice alone having been an&s;wered, that the &s;tranger was Valancourt, as well as that he knew her, and &s;he gave her|&s;elf up to &s;peechle&s;s joy. Annette however, was not &s;peechle&s;s. She renewed her calls, but received no an&s;wer; and Emily, fear|ing, that a further attempt, which certainly was, at pre&s;ent,
<PB N="223" REF="029378_0225_0FE084DB53DD5F78">
highly dangerous, might expo&s;e them to the guards of the ca&s;tle, while it could not perhaps terminate her &s;u&s;pen&s;e, in&s;i&s;ted on Annette's dropping the inquiry for this night; though &s;he deter|mined her&s;elf to que&s;tion Ludovico, on the &s;ubject, in the morning, more urgently than &s;he had yet done. She was now enabled to &s;ay, that the &s;tranger, whom &s;he had formerly heard, was &s;till in the ca&s;tle, and to direct Ludovico, to that part of it, in which he was confined.</P>
<P>Emily, attended by Annette, continued at the ca&s;ement, for &s;ometime, but all remained &s;till; they heard neither lute or voice again, and Emily was now as much oppre&s;&s;ed by anxious joy, as &s;he lately was by a &s;en&s;e of her misfortunes. With ha&s;ty &s;teps &s;he paced the room, now half calling on Valancourt's name, then &s;uddenly &s;topping, and now going to the ca&s;ement and li&s;|tening, where, however, &s;he heard nothing but the &s;olemn wav|ing of the woods. Sometimes her impatience to &s;peak to Lu|dovico prompted her to &s;end Annette to call him; but a &s;en&s;e of the impropriety of this at midnight re&s;trained her. Annette meanwhile, as impatient as her mi&s;tre&s;s, went as often to the ca&s;ement to li&s;ten, and returned almo&s;t as much di&s;appointed. She, at length, mentioned Signor Verezzi, and her fear, le&s;t he &s;hould enter the chamber by the &s;tairca&s;e door. "But the night is now almo&s;t pa&s;t, mademoi&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, recollecting her&s;elf, "there is the morning light, beginning to peep over tho&s;e moun|tains yonder in the ea&s;t."</P>
<P>Emily had forgotten till this moment, that &s;uch a per&s;on ex|i&s;ted as Verezzi, and all the danger that had appeared to threaten her; but the mention of his name renewed her alarm, and &s;he remembered the old che&s;t, that &s;he had wi&s;hed to place again&s;t the door, which &s;he now, with Annette, attempted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but it was &s;o heavy, that they could not lift it from the floor, "What is in this great old che&s;t, mademoi&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "that makes it &s;o weighty?" Emily having replied, "that &s;he found it in the chamber, when &s;he fir&s;t came to the ca&s;tle, and had never examined it,"&mdash;"Then I will, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid An|nette, and &s;he tried to lift the lid; but this was held by a lock, for which &s;he had no key, and which, indeed, appeared, from its peculiar con&s;truction, to open with a &s;pring. The morning now glimmered through the ca&s;ements, and the wind had &s;unk into a calm. Emily looked out upon the du&s;ky woods, and on the twilight mountains, ju&s;t &s;tealing on the eye, and &s;aw the whole &s;cene, after the &s;torm, lying in profound &s;tillne&s;s, the woods mo|tionle&s;s, and the clouds above, through which the dawn trem|bled
<PB N="224" REF="029378_0226_0FE084DFEECE6818">
&s;carcely appearing to move along the heavens. One &s;oldier was pacing the terrace beneath, with mea&s;ured &s;teps; and two, more di&s;tant, were &s;unk a&s;leep on the walls, wearied with the night's watch. Having inhaled, for a while, the pure &s;pirit of the air, and of vegetation, which the late rains had called forth, and having li&s;tened, once more, for a note of mu&s;ic, &s;he now clo&s;ed the ca&s;ement, and retired to re&s;t.</P>

<P>SEVERAL of her &s;ucceeding days pa&s;&s;ed in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, for Lu|dovico could only learn from the &s;oldiers, that there was a pri|&s;oner in the apartment, de&s;cribed to him by Emily, and that he was a Frenchman, whom they had taken in one of their &s;kirmi&s;h|es, with a party of his countrymen. During this interval, Emily e&s;caped the per&s;ecutions of Bertolini, and Verezzi, by confining her&s;elf to her apartment; except that &s;ometimes, in an evening, &s;he ventured to walk in the adjoining corridor. Montoni ap|peared to re&s;pect his la&s;t promi&s;e, though he had prophaned his fir&s;t; for to his protection only could &s;he attribute her pre&s;ent repo&s;e; and in this &s;he was now &s;o &s;ecure, that &s;he did not wi&s;h to leave the ca&s;tle, till &s;he could obtain &s;ome certainty concern|ing Valancourt; for which &s;he waited, indeed, without any &s;a|crifice of her own comfort, &s;ince no circum&s;tance had occurred to make her e&s;cape probable.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="029378_0229_0FE084F22ED31F20">
On the fourth day, Ludovico informed her, that he had hopes of being admitted to the pre&s;ence of the pri&s;oner; it being the turn of a &s;oldier, with whom he had been for &s;ometime famil|iar, to attend him on the following night. He was not deceiv|ed in his hope; for under pretence of carrying in a pitcher of water, he entered the pri&s;on, though, his prudence having pre|vented him from telling the &s;entinel the real motive of his vi&s;it, he was obliged to make his conference with the pri&s;oner a very &s;hort one.</P>
<P>Emily awaited the re&s;ult in her own apartment, Ludovico having promi&s;ed to accompany Annette to the corridor, in the evening; where, after &s;everal hours impatiently counted, he ar|rived. Emily, having then uttered the name of Valancourt, could articulate no more, but he&s;itated in trembling expectation. "The Chevalier would not entru&s;t me with his name, Signora," replied Ludovico; "but, when I ju&s;t mentioned yours, he &s;eemed overwhelmed with joy, though he was not &s;o much &s;ur|pri&s;ed as I expected." "Does he then remember me?" &s;he exclaimed.</P>
<P>"O! it is Mon&s;. Valancourt," &s;aid Annette, and looked im|patiently at Ludovico, who under&s;tood her look, and replied to Emily: "Yes, lady, the Chevalier does, indeed, remember you, and, I am &s;ure, has a very great regard for you, and I made bold to &s;ay you had for him. He then inquired how you came to know he was in the ca&s;tle, and whether you ordered me to &s;peak to him. The fir&s;t que&s;tion I could not an&s;wer, but the &s;econd I did; and then he went off into his ec&s;ta&s;ies again. I was afraid his joy would have betrayed him to the &s;entinel at the door."</P>
<P>"But how does he look, Ludovico?" interrupted Emily: "is he not melancholy and ill with this long confinement?"&mdash;"Why, as to melancholy, I &s;aw no &s;ymptom of that, lady, while I was with him, for he &s;eemed in the fine&s;t &s;pirits I ever &s;aw any body in, in all my life. His countenance was all joy, and, if one may judge from that, he was very well; but I did not a&s;k him." "Did he &s;end me no me&s;&s;age?" &s;aid Emily. "O yes, Signora, and &s;omething be&s;ides," replied Ludovico, who &s;earch|ed his pockets. "Surely, I have not lo&s;t it," added he. "The Chevalier &s;aid, he would have written, madam, if he had had pen and ink, and was going to have &s;ent a very long me&s;&s;age, when the &s;entinel entered the room, but not before he had given me this." Ludovico then drew forth a miniature from his bo|&s;om, which Emily received with a trembling hand, and perceiv|ed
<PB N="5" REF="029378_0229_0FE084F22ED31F20">
to be a portrait of her&s;elf&mdash;the very picture which her mother had lo&s;t &s;o &s;trangely in the fi&s;hing hou&s;e at La Vallee.</P>
<P>Tears of mingled joy and tenderne&s;s flowed to her eyes, while Ludovico proceeded&mdash;"Tell your Lady, &s;aid the Chevalier, as he gave me the picture, 'that this has been my companion, and only &s;olace in all my misfortunes. Tell her, that I have worn it next my heart, and that I &s;end it her as the pledge of an affection, which can never die; that I would not part with it, but to her, for the wealth of worlds, and that I now part with it, only in the hope of &s;oon receiving it from her hands. Tell her'&mdash;Ju&s;t then, Signora, the &s;entinel came in, and the Chevalier &s;aid no more; but he had before a&s;ked me to contrive an interview for him with you; and when I told him, how little hope I had of prevailing with the guard to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, he &s;aid, that was not, perhaps, of &s;o much con&s;equence as I im|agined, and bade me contrive to bring back your an&s;wer, and he would inform me of more than he cho&s;e to do then. So this, I think lady, is the whole of what pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>"How, Ludovico, &s;hall I reward you for your zeal?" &s;aid Emily: "but, indeed, I do not now po&s;&s;e&s;s the means. When can you &s;ee the Chevalier again?" "That is uncertain, Signo|ra," replied he. "It depends upon who &s;tands guard next: there are not more than one or two among them, from whom I would dare to a&s;k admittance to the pri&s;on chamber."</P>
<P>"I need not bid you remember, Ludovico," re&s;umed Emily, "how very much intere&s;ted I am in your &s;eeing the Chevalier &s;oon; and, when you do &s;o, tell him, that I have received the picture, and, with the &s;entiments he wi&s;hed. Tell him I have &s;uffered much, and &s;till &s;uffer&mdash;" She pau&s;ed. "But &s;hall I tell him you will &s;ee him, lady?" &s;aid Ludovico. "Mo&s;t cer|tainly I will," replied Emily. "But when, Signora, and where?" "That mu&s;t depend upon circum&s;tances," returned Emily.&mdash;"The place, and the hour, mu&s;t be regulated by his opportu|nities."</P>
<P>"As to the place, mademoi&s;elle," &s;aid Annette, "there is no other place in the ca&s;tle, be&s;ides this corridor, where <HI>we</HI> can &s;ee him in &s;afety, you know; and, as for the hour,&mdash;it mu&s;t be when all the Signors are a&s;leep, if that ever happens!" "You may mention the&s;e circum&s;tances to the Chevalier, Ludovico," &s;aid &s;he, checking the flippancy of Annette, and leave them to his judgment and opportunity. Tell him my heart is unchanged. But, above all, let him &s;ee you again as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and, Ludovico, I think it is needle&s;s to tell you I &s;hall very anxiou&s;ly
<PB N="6" REF="029378_0230_0FE084F6F67CE9E0">
look for you." Having then wi&s;hed her good night, Ludovico de&s;cended the &s;tairca&s;e, and Emily retired to re&s;t, but not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">leep, for joy now rendered her as wakeful, as &s;he had ever been from grief. Montoni and his ca&s;tle had all vani&s;hed from her mind, like the frightful vi&s;ion of a necromancer, and &s;he wan|dered, once more, in fairy &s;cenes of unfading happine&s;s:
<Q><L>&mdash;"As when, beneath the beam</L>
<L>Of &s;ummer moons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tant woods among,</L>
<L>Or by &s;ome flood, all &s;ilver'd with the gleam,</L>
<L>The &s;oft embodied Fays thro' airy portals &s;tream."</L></Q></P>
<P>A week elap&s;ed, before Ludovico again vi&s;ited the pri&s;on; for the &s;entinels, during that period, were men, in whom he could not confide, and he feared to awaken curio&s;ity, by a&s;king to &s;ee their pri&s;oner. In this interval, he communicated to Emily ter|rific reports of what was pa&s;&s;ing in the ca&s;tle; of riots, quarrels, and of carou&s;als more alarming than either; while from &s;ome circum&s;tances, which he mentioned, &s;he not only doubted, whe|ther Montoni meant ever to relea&s;e her, but greatly feared, that he had de&s;igns concerning her,&mdash;&s;uch as &s;he had formerly dread|ed. Her name was frequently mentioned in the conver&s;ations, which Bertolini and Verezzi held together, and, at tho&s;e times, they were frequently in contention. Montoni had lo&s;t large &s;ums to Verezzi, &s;o that there was a dreadful po&s;&s;ibility of his de&s;igning her to be a &s;ub&s;titute for the debt; but, as &s;he was ignorant, that he had formerly encouraged the hopes of Bertoli|ni al&s;o, concerning her&s;elf, after the latter had done him &s;ome &s;ignal &s;ervice, &s;he knew not how to account for the&s;e contentions between Bertolini and Verezzi. The cau&s;e of them, however, appeared to be of little con&s;equence, for &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw de|&s;truction approaching in many forms, and her entreaties to Lu|dovico to contrive an e&s;cape, and to &s;ee the pri&s;oner again, were more urgent than ever.</P>
<P>At length, he informed her, that he had again vi&s;ited the Che|valier, who had directed him to confide in the guard of the pri|&s;on, from whom he had already received &s;ome in&s;tances of kind|ne&s;s, and who had promi&s;ed to permit his going into the ca&s;tle for half an hour, on the en&s;uing night, when Montoni and his companions &s;hould be engaged at their carou&s;als. "This was kind, to be &s;ure," added Ludovico: "but Seba&s;tian knows he runs no ri&s;que in letting the Chevalier out, for, if he can get be|yond the bars and iron doors of the ca&s;tle, he mu&s;t be cunning indeed. But the Chevalier de&s;ired me, Signora, to go to you
<PB N="7" REF="029378_0230_0FE084F6F67CE9E0">
immediately, and to beg you would allow him to vi&s;it you, this night, if it was only for a moment, for that he could no longer live under the &s;ame roof, without &s;eeing you; the hour, he &s;aid, he could not mention, for it mu&s;t depend on circum&s;tances (ju&s;t as you &s;aid, Signora) and the place he de&s;ired you would appoint, as knowing which was be&s;t for your own &s;afety."</P>
<P>Emily was now &s;o much agitated by the near pro&s;pect of meet|ing Valancourt, that it was &s;ometime, before &s;he could give any an&s;wer to Ludovico, or con&s;ider of the place of meeting; when &s;he did, &s;he &s;aw none, that promi&s;ed &s;o much &s;ecurity, as the corridor, near her own apartment, which &s;he was checked from leaving, by the apprehen&s;ion of meeting any of Montoni's gue&s;ts, on their way to their rooms; and &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;cruples, which delicacy oppo&s;ed, now that a &s;erious danger was to be avoided dy encountering them. It was &s;ettled, therefore, that the Chevalier &s;hould meet her in the corridor, at that hour of the night, which Ludovico, who was to be upon the watch, &s;hould judge &s;afe&s;t: and Emily, as may be imagined, pa&s;&s;ed this inter|val in a tumult of hope and joy, anxiety and impatience. Never, &s;ince her re&s;idence in the ca&s;tle, had &s;he watched, with &s;o much plea&s;ure, the &s;un &s;et behind th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> mountains, and twilight &s;hade, and darkne&s;s veil the &s;cene, as on this evening. She counted the notes of the great clock, and li&s;tened to the &s;teps of the &s;en|tinels, as they changed the watch, only to rejoice, that another hour was gone. "O, Valancourt!" &s;aid &s;he, "after all I have &s;uffered; after our long, long &s;eparation, when I thought I &s;hould never&mdash;never &s;ee you more&mdash;we are &s;till to meet again! O! I have endured grief, and anxiety, and terror, and let me, then, not &s;ink beneath this joy!" The&s;e were moments, when it was im|po&s;&s;ible for her to feel emotions of regret, or melancholy, for any ordinary intere&s;ts; even the reflection, that &s;he had re&s;igned the e&s;tates, which would have been a provi&s;ion for her&s;elf and Valan|court for life, threw only a light and tran&s;ient &s;hade upon her &s;pirits. The idea of Valancourt, and that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him &s;o &s;oon, alone occupied her heart.</P>
<P>At length the clock &s;truck twelve; &s;he opened the door to li&s;ten, if any noi&s;e was in the ca&s;tle, and heard only di&s;tant &s;houts of riot and laughter, echoed feebly along the gallery. She gue&s;&s;|ed, that the Signor and his gue&s;ts were at the banquet. "They are now engaged for the night," &s;aid &s;he; "and Valancourt will &s;oon be here." Having &s;oftly clo&s;ed the door, &s;he paced the room with impatient &s;teps, and often went to the ca&s;ement to li&s;ten for the lute; but all was &s;ilent, and, her agitation every
<PB N="8" REF="029378_0231_0FE0850408447C50">
moment encrea&s;ing, &s;he was at length unable to &s;upport her&s;elf, and &s;at down by the window. Annette, whom &s;he detained, was, in the meantime, as loquacious as u&s;ual; but Emily heard &s;carcely any thing &s;he &s;aid, and having at length ri&s;en to the ca&s;e|ment, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the chords of the lute, &s;truck with an ex|pre&s;&s;ive hand, and then the voice, &s;he had formerly li&s;tened to, accompanied it.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Now ri&s;ing love they fann'd, now plea&s;ing dole</L>
<L>They breath'd in tender mu&s;ings through the heart;</L>
<L>And now a graver, &s;acred &s;train they &s;tole,</L>
<L>As when &s;eraphic hands an hymn impart!"</L>
</LG>
<P>Emily wept in doubtful joy and tenderne&s;s; and, when the &s;train cea&s;ed, &s;he con&s;idered it as a &s;ignal, that Valancourt was about to leave the pri&s;on. Soon after, &s;he heard &s;teps in the corridor;&mdash;they were the light, quick &s;teps of hope: &s;he could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf, as they approached, but opening the door of the apartment, &s;he advanced to meet Valancourt, and, in the next moment, &s;unk in the arms of a &s;tranger. His voice his countenance in&s;tantly convinced her, and &s;he fainted away.</P>
<P>On reviving, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;upported by the &s;tranger, who was watching over her recovery, with a countenance of ineffable tenderne&s;s and anxiety. She had no &s;pirits for reply, or inquiry, &s;he a&s;ked no que&s;tions, but bur&s;t into tears, and di&s;engaged her|&s;elf from his arms: when the expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance changed to &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;appointment, and he turned to Lu|dovico for an explanation; Annette &s;oon gave the information, which Ludovico could not. "O, &s;ir,!" &s;aid &s;he, in a voice, interrupted with &s;obs; "O, &s;ir! you are not the other Cheva|lier. We expected Mon&s;ieur Valancourt, but you are not he! O Ludovico! how could you deceive us &s;o? my poor lady will never recover it&mdash;never!" The &s;tranger, who now appeared much agitated, attempted to &s;peak, but his words faltered; and then &s;triking his hand again&s;t his forehead, as if in &s;udden de&s;|pair, he walked abruptly to the other end of the corridor.</P>
<P>Suddenly, Annette dried her tears, and &s;poke to Ludovico. "But, perhaps," &s;aid &s;he, "after all, the other Chevalier is not this: perhaps the Chevalier Valancourt is &s;till below." Emily rai&s;ed her head. "No," replied Ludovico, "Mon&s;ieur Va|lancourt, never was below, if this gentleman is not he," "if you &s;ir," &s;aid Ludovico, addre&s;&s;ing the &s;tranger, "would but have had the goodne&s;s to tru&s;t me with your name, this mi&s;take had been avoided." "Mo&s;t true," replied the &s;tranger, &s;peaking in
<PB N="9" REF="029378_0231_0FE0850408447C50">
broken Italian, "but it was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to me, that my name &s;hould be concealed from Montoni. Madam," added he then, addre&s;&s;ing Emily in French, "will you permit me to apologize for the pain I have occa&s;ioned you, and to explain to you alone my name, and the circum&s;tance, which has led me into this error? I am of France;&mdash;I am your countryman;&mdash;we are met in a foreign land." Emily tried to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, yet &s;he he&s;itated to grant his reque&s;t. At length, de&s;iring, that Ludovico would wait on the &s;tairca&s;e, and detaining Annette, &s;he told the &s;tranger, that her woman under&s;tood very little Ital|ian, and begged he would communicate what he wi&s;hed to &s;ay in that language.&mdash;Having withdrawn to a di&s;tant part of the corridor, he &s;aid, with a long drawn &s;igh, "You, madam, are no &s;tranger to me, though I am &s;o unhappy as to be unknown to you.&mdash;My name is Du Pont; I am of France, of Ga&s;cony, your native province, and have long admired,&mdash;and, why &s;hould I affect to di&s;gui&s;e it!&mdash;have long loved you." He pau&s;ed, but, in the next moment, proceeded. "My family, madam, is prob|ably not unknown to you, for we lived within a few miles of La Vallee, and I have, &s;ometimes, had the happine&s;s of meeting you on vi&s;its in the neighbourhood. I will not offend you by repeating how much you intere&s;ted me; how much I loved to wander in the &s;cenes you frequented; how often I vi&s;ited your favourite fi&s;hing hou&s;e, and lamented the circum&s;tance, which, at that time, forbade me to reveal my pa&s;&s;ion. I will not ex|plain how I &s;urrendered to temptation, and became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a trea&s;ure, which was to me ine&s;timable; a trea&s;ure, which I committed to your me&s;&s;enger, a few days ago, with expectations very different from my pre&s;ent ones. I will &s;ay nothing of the&s;e circum&s;tances, for I know they will avail me little; let me only &s;upplicate from your forgivene&s;s, and the picture, which I &s;o unwarily returned. Your genero&s;ity will pardon the theft, and re&s;tore the prize. My crime has been my puni&s;hment; for the portrait I &s;tole has contributed to nouri&s;h a pa&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t &s;till be my torment."</P>
<P>Emily now interrupted him. "I think, &s;ir, I may leave it to your integrity to determine, whether, after what has ju&s;t appear|ed, concerning Mon&s;. Valancourt, I ought to return the picture. I think you will acknowledge, that this would not be genero|&s;ity; and you will allow me to add, that it would be doing my|&s;elf an inju&s;tice. I mu&s;t con&s;ider my&s;elf honoured by your good opinion, but"&mdash;and &s;he he&s;itated,&mdash;"the mi&s;take of this even|ing makes it unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay more."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="029378_0232_0FE0850897AFDBA8">
"It does, madam,&mdash;alas! it does!" &s;aid the &s;tranger, who, af|ter a long pau&s;e, proceeded.&mdash;"But you will allow me to &s;hew my di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, though not my love, and will accept the &s;ervices I offer. Yet, alas! what &s;ervices can I offer? I am my&s;elf a pri&s;oner, a &s;ufferer, like you. But, dear as liberty is to me, I would not &s;eek it through half the hazards I would encounter to deliver you from this rece&s;s of vice. Accept the offered &s;ervices of a friend; do not refu&s;e me the reward of hav|ing, at lea&s;t, attempted to de&s;erve your thanks."</P>
<P>"You de&s;erve them already, &s;ir, "&s;aid Emily; "the wi&s;h de|&s;erves my warme&s;t thanks. But you will excu&s;e me for remind|ing you of the danger you incur by prolonging this interview. It will be a great con&s;olation to me to remember, whether your friendly attempts to relea&s;e me &s;ucceed or not, that I have a countryman, who would &s;o generou&s;ly protect me,"&mdash;Mon&s;ieur Du Pont took her hand, which &s;he but feebly attempted to withdraw, and pre&s;&s;ed it re&s;pectfully to his lips. "Allow me to breathe another fervent &s;igh for your happine&s;s," &s;aid he, "and to applaud my&s;elf for an affection, which I cannot conquer." As he &s;aid this, Emily heard a noi&s;e from her apartment, and, turn|ing round, &s;aw the door from the &s;tairca&s;e open, and a man ru&s;h into her chamber. "I will teach you to conquer it," cried he, as he advanced into the corridor, and drew a &s;tiletto, which he aimed at Du Pont, who was unarmed, but who, &s;tepping back, avoided the blow, and then &s;prung upon Verezzi, from whom he wrenched the &s;tiletto. While they &s;truggled in each other's gra&s;p, Emily, followed by Annette, ran further into the corri|dor, calling on Ludovico, who was, however, gone from the &s;tairca&s;e, and, as &s;he advanced, terrified and uncertain what to do, a di&s;tant noi&s;e that &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the hall, reminded her of the danger &s;he was incurring; and, &s;ending Annette for|ward in &s;earch of Ludovico, &s;he returned to the &s;pot were Du Pont and Verezzi were &s;till &s;truggling for victory. It was her own cau&s;e which was to be decided with that of the former, who&s;e, conduct, independently of this circum&s;tance, would, how|ever, have intere&s;ted her in his &s;ucce&s;s, even had &s;he not di&s;liked and dreaded Verezzi. She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her&s;elf in a chair, and &s;uppli|cated them to de&s;i&s;t from further violence, till, at length, Du Pont forced Verezzi to the floor, where he lay &s;tunned by the violence of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and &s;he then entreated Du Pont to e&s;cape from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before Montoni, or his party, &s;hould appear; but he &s;till refu&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> leave her unprotected; and, while Emi|ly, new more terrified for him, than for her&s;elf, enforced the entreaty, they heard &s;teps a&s;cending the private &s;tairca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="029378_0232_0FE0850897AFDBA8">
"O you are lo&s;t!" cried &s;he, "the&s;e are Montoni's people." Du Pont made no reply, but &s;upported Emily, while, with a &s;teady, though eager, countenance, he awaited their appearance, and, in the next moment, Ludovico, alone mounted the land|ing place. Throwing an ha&s;ty glance round the chamber, "Fol|low me," &s;aid he, "as you value your lives; we have not an in&s;tant to lo&s;e!"</P>
<P>Emily inquired what had occurred, and whither they were to go?</P>
<P>"I cannot &s;tay to tell you now, Signora," replied Ludovico: "&s;ly! &s;ly!"</P>
<P>She immediately followed him, accompanied by Mon&s;. Du Pont, down the &s;tairca&s;e, and along a vaulted pa&s;&s;age, when &s;ud|denly &s;he recollected Annette, and inquired for her. "She awaits us further on, Signora," &s;aid Ludovico, almo&s;t breathle&s;s with ha&s;te; "the gates were open, a moment &s;ince, to a party ju&s;t come in from the mountains: they will be &s;hut I fear before we can reach them! Through this door, Signora," added Ludo|vico, holding down the lamp, "take care, here are two &s;teps." Emily followed, trembling &s;till more, than before &s;he had under&s;tood that her e&s;cape from the ca&s;tle depended upon the pre&s;ent mo|ment; while Du Pont &s;upported her, and endeavoured, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, to cheer her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"Speak low, Signor," &s;aid Ludovico, "the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages &s;end echoes all round the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>"Take care of the light," cried Emily, "you go &s;o fa&s;t, that the air will extingui&s;h it."</P>
<P>Ludovico now opened another door, where they found Annette, and the party then de&s;cended a &s;hort flight of &s;teps into a pa&s;&s;age, which, Ludovico &s;aid, led round the inner court of the ca&s;tle, and opened into the outer one. As they advanced, confu&s;ed and tumultuous &s;ounds, that &s;eemed to come from the inner court, a|larmed Emily. "Nay, Signora," &s;aid Ludovico, "our only hope is in that tumult; while the Signor's people are bu&s;ied about the men, who are ju&s;t arrived, we may, perhaps, pa&s;s unnoticed through the gates. But hu&s;h!" he added, as they approached the &s;mall door, that opened into the outer court, "if you will remain here a moment, I will go to &s;ee whether the gates are open, and any body is in the way. Pray extingui&s;h the light, Signor, if you hear me talking," continued Ludovico, delivering the lamp to Du Pont, "and remain quite &s;till."</P>
<P>Saying this, he &s;tepped out upon the court, and they clo&s;ed the door, li&s;tening anxiou&s;ly to his departing &s;teps. No voice,
<PB N="12" REF="029378_0233_0FE08517CD5953F0">
however, was heard in the court, which he was cro&s;&s;ing, though a confu&s;ion of many voices yet i&s;&s;ued from the inner one. "We &s;hall &s;oon be beyond the walls," &s;aid Du Pont &s;oftly to Emily, "&s;upport your&s;elf a little longer, Madam, and all will be well."</P>
<P>But &s;oon they heard Ludovico &s;peaking loud, and the voice al&s;o of &s;ome other per&s;on, and Du Pont immediately extingui&s;h|ed the lamp. "Ah! it is too late!" exclaimed Emily, "what is to become of us?" They li&s;tened again, and then perceived, that Ludovico was talking with a &s;entinel, who&s;e voices were heard al&s;o by Emily's favourite dog, that had followed her from the chamber, and now barked loudly. "This dog will betray us!" &s;aid Du Pont, "I will hold him." "I fear he has already betrayed us!" replied Emily. Du Pont, however, caught him up, and, again li&s;tening to what was going on without, they heard Ludovico &s;ay, "I'll watch the gates the while."</P>
<P>"Stay a minute, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">lied the &s;entinel, "and you need not have the trouble, for the hor&s;es will be &s;ent round to the outer &s;tables, then the gates will be &s;hut, and I can leave my po&s;t." "I don't mind the trouble, comrade," &s;aid Ludovico, "you will do &s;uch another good turn for me, &s;ometime. Go&mdash;go, and fetch the wine; the rogues, that are ju&s;t come in, will drink it all el&s;e."</P>
<P>The &s;oldier he&s;itated, and then called aloud to the people in the &s;econd court, to know why they did not &s;end out the hor|&s;es, that the gates might be &s;hut; but they were too much en|gaged, to attend to him, even if they had heard his voice.</P>
<P>"Aye&mdash;aye," &s;aid Ludovico, "they know better than that; they are &s;haring it all among them; if you wait till the hor&s;es come out, you mu&s;t wait till the wine is drunk. I have had my &s;hare already, but &s;ince you do not care about yours, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why I &s;hould not have that too."</P>
<P>"Hold, hold, not &s;o fa&s;t," cried the &s;entinel, "do watch then, for a moment: I'll be with you pre&s;ently."</P>
<P>"Don't hurry your&s;elf," &s;aid Ludovico coolly, "I have kept guard before now. But you may leave me your trombone,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A kind of Blunderbu&s;s.</NOTE> that if the ca&s;tle &s;hould be attacked, you know, I may be able to defend the pa&s;s like a hero."</P>
<P>"There, my, good fellow," returned the &s;oldier, "there, take it&mdash;it has &s;een &s;ervice, though it could do little in defend|ing the ca&s;tle. I'll tell you a good &s;tory though about this &s;ame trombone."</P>
<P>"You'll tell it better when you have had the wine," &s;aid Lu|dovico. "There! they are coming out from the court already."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="029378_0233_0FE08517CD5953F0">
"I'll have the wine, though," &s;aid the &s;entinel, running off. "I won't keep you a minute."</P>
<P>"Take your time, I am in no ha&s;te," replied Ludovico, who was already hurrying acro&s;s the court, when the &s;oldier came back. "Whither &s;o fa&s;t, friend&mdash;whither &s;o fa&s;t?" &s;aid the latter. What! is this the way you keep watch? I mu&s;t &s;tand to my po&s;t my&s;elf, I &s;ee."</P>
<P>"Aye, well," replied Ludovico, "you have &s;aved me the trou|ble of following you further, for I wanted to tell you, if you have a mind to drink the Tu&s;cany wine you mu&s;t go to Seba&s;|tain, he is dealing it out; the other that Federico has is not worth having. But you are not likely to have any, I &s;ee for they are all coming out."</P>
<P>"By St. Peter! &s;o they are," &s;aid the &s;oldier, and again ran off, while Ludovico, once more at liberty ha&s;tened to the door of the pa&s;&s;age, where Emily was &s;inking under the anxiety this long di&s;cour&s;e had occa&s;ioned; but, on his telling them the court was clear, they followed him to the gates, without waiting another in&s;tant yet not before he had &s;eized two hor&s;es, that had &s;trayed from the &s;econd court, and were picking a &s;canty meal among the gra&s;s, which grew between the pavement of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed, without interruption, the dreadful gates, and took the road that led down among the woods, Emily, Mon&s;ieur Du Pont and Annette on foot, and Ludovico, who was mounted on one hor&s;e, leading the other. Having reached them they &s;topped, while Emily and Annette, were placed on hor&s;eback with their two protectors, when, Ludovico leading the way, they &s;et off as fa&s;t as the broken road, and the feeble light, which a ri&s;ing moon threw among the foliage, would permit.</P>
<P>Emily was &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed by this &s;udden departure, that &s;he &s;carcely dared to believe her&s;elf awake; and &s;he yet much doubted whether this adventure would terminate in e&s;cape,&mdash;a doubt, which had too much probability to ju&s;tify it; for, be|fore they quitted the woods, they heard &s;houts in the wind, and, on emerging from them, &s;aw lights move quickly near the ca&s;|tle above. Du Pont whipped his hor&s;e, and with &s;ome difficulty compelled him to go fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>"Ah! poor bea&s;t," &s;aid Ludovico, "he is weary enough;&mdash;he has been out all day, but, Signor, we mu&s;t fly for it, now; for yonder are the lights coming this way."</P>
<P>Having given his own hor&s;e a la&s;h, they now both &s;et off on a full gallop; and, when they again looked back, the lights were &s;o di&s;tant as &s;carcely to be di&s;cerned, and the voices were
<PB N="14" REF="029378_0234_0FE0851DFAEBDCC0">
&s;unk into &s;ilence. The travellers then abated their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, and, con&s;ulting whither they &s;hould direct their cour&s;e, it was deter|mined they &s;hould de&s;cend into Tu&s;cany, and endeavour to reach the Mediterranean, where they could readily embark for France. Thither Du Pont meant to attend Emily, if he &s;hould learn, that the regiment he had accompanied into Italy, was returned to his native country.</P>
<P>They were now in the road which Emily had travelled with Ugo and Bertrand; but Ludovico, who was the only one of the party, acquainted with the pa&s;&s;es of the&s;e mountains, &s;aid, that a little further on, a bye-road, branching from this, would lead them down into Tu&s;cany with very little difficulty; and that, at a few leagues di&s;tance, was a &s;mall town, where nece&s;&s;a|ries could be procured for their journey.</P>
<P>"But, I hope," added he, "we &s;hall meet with no &s;traggling parties of banditti; &s;ome of them are abroad, I know. How|ever, I have got a good trombone, which will be of &s;ome &s;ervice, if we &s;hould encounter any of tho&s;e brave &s;pirits. You have no arms, Signor?" "Yes," replied Du Pont, "I have the villain's &s;tiletto, who would have &s;tabbed me&mdash;but let us rejoice in our e&s;cape from Udolpho, nor torment our&s;elves with looking out for dangers, that may never arrive."</P>
<P>The moon was now ri&s;en high over the woods, that hung up|on the &s;ides of the narrow glen, through which they wandered, and afforded them light &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h their way, and to avoid the loo&s;e and broken &s;tones, that frequently cro&s;&s;ed it. They now travelled lei&s;urely, and in profound &s;ilence; for they had &s;carcely yet recovered from the a&s;toni&s;hment, into which this &s;udden e&s;cape had thrown them.&mdash;Emily's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, e&s;pecially was &s;unk, after the various emotions it had &s;uffered, into a kind of mu&s;ing &s;tillne&s;s, which the repo&s;ing beauty of the &s;urrounding &s;cene and the creeping murmur of the night-breeze among the foliage above contributed to prolong. She thought of Valan|court, and of France, with hope, and &s;he would have thought of them with joy, had not the fir&s;t events of this evening hara&s;&s;ed her &s;pirits too much, to permit her now too feel &s;o lively a &s;en|&s;ation. Meanwhile, Emily was alone the object of Dupont's me|lancholy con&s;ideration; yet, with the de&s;pondency he &s;uffered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he mu&s;ed on his recent di&s;appointment, was mingled a &s;weet plea&s;ure, occa&s;ioned by her pre&s;ence, though they did not now ex|change a &s;ingle word. Annette thought of this wonderful e&s;|cape, of the bu&s;tle in which Montoni and his people mu&s;t be, now that their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light was di&s;covered; of her native country, whither
<PB N="15" REF="029378_0234_0FE0851DFAEBDCC0">
&s;he hoped &s;he was returning, and of her marriage with Ludovi|co, to which there no longer appeared any impediment, for pov|erty &s;he did not con&s;ider &s;uch. Ludovico, on his part congrat|ulated him&s;elf, on having re&s;cued his Annette and <HI>Signora</HI> Emily from the danger that had &s;urrounded them; on his own liberation from people who&s;e manners he had long dete&s;ted, on the freedom he had given to Mon&s;ieur Du Pont; on his pro&s;pect of happi|ne&s;s with the object of his affections, and not a little on the ad|dre&s;s, with which he had deceived the &s;entinel, and conducted the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this affair.</P>
<P>Thus variou&s;ly engaged in thought, the travellers pa&s;&s;ed on &s;ilently, for above an hour, a que&s;tion only being, now and then a&s;ked by Du Pont, concerning the road, or a remark uttered by Annette, re&s;pecting objects &s;een imperfectly in the twilight.</P>
<P>At length, lights were perceived twinkling on the &s;ide of a mountain, and Ludovico had no doubt, that they proceed|ed from the town he had mentioned, while his companions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this a&s;&s;urance &s;unk again into &s;ilence. Annette was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who interrupted this. "Holy Peter!" &s;aid &s;he, "What &s;hall we do for money on our journey? for I know neither I, or my lady, have a &s;ingle &s;equin; the Signor took care of that!"</P>
<P>This remark produced a &s;erious inquiry, which ended in as &s;erious embarra&s;&s;ment, for Du Pont had been rifled of nearly all his money when he was taken pri&s;oner; the remainder he had given to the &s;entinel, who had enabled him occa&s;ionally to leave his pri&s;on chamber; and Ludovico, who had for &s;ometime found a difficulty, in procuring any part of the wages due to him, had now &s;carcely ca&s;h &s;ufficient to procure nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment at the fir&s;t town, in which they &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>Their poverty was the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, &s;ince it would detain them among the mountains, where, even in a town, they could &s;carcely con&s;ider them&s;elves &s;afe from Montoni. The travellers, however, had only to proceed and dare the future; and they continued their way through lonely wilds and du&s;ky vallies, where the overhanging foliage now admitted, and then excluded the moonlight; wilds &s;o de&s;olate, that they appeared, on the fir&s;t glance, as if no human being had ever trode them before. Even the road, in which the party were, did but &s;lightly con|tradict this error, for the high gra&s;s and other luxuriant vegeta|tion, with which it was overgrown, told how very &s;eldom the foot of a traveller had pa&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>At length, from a di&s;tance, was heard the faint tinkling of a &s;heep bell; and, &s;oon after, the bleat of flocks, and the party then
<PB N="16" REF="029378_0235_0FE0852CE1146240">
knew, that they were near &s;ome human habitation, for the light, which Ludovico had fancied to proceed from a town, had long been concealed by intervening mountains. Cheered by this hope, they quickened their pace along the narrow pa&s;s they were winding, and it opened upon one of tho&s;e pa&s;toral vallies of the Apennines, which might be painted for a &s;cene of Arcadia, and who&s;e beauty and &s;implicity are finely contra&s;ted by the gran|deur of the &s;now topt mountains above.</P>
<P>The morning light, now glimmering in the horizon, &s;hewed faintly, at a little di&s;tance, upon the brow of a hill, which &s;eem|ed to peep from "under the opening eyelids of the morn," the town they were in &s;earch of, and which they &s;oon after reached. It was not without &s;ome difficulty, that they there found a hou&s;e, which could afford &s;helter for them&s;elves and their hor&s;es; and Emily de&s;ired they might not re&s;t longer than was nece&s;&s;ary for refre&s;hment. Her appearance excited &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; for &s;he was without a hat, having had time only to throw on her veil before &s;he left the ca&s;tle, a circum&s;tance that compelled her to regret again the want of money, without which it was impo&s;|&s;ible to procure this nece&s;&s;ary article of dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Ludovico, on examining his pur&s;e; found it even in&s;ufficient to &s;upply pre&s;ent refre&s;hment, and Du Pont, at length, ventured to inform the landlord, who&s;e countenance was &s;imple and hon|e&s;t of their exact &s;ituation, and reque&s;ted that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t them to pur&s;ue their journey; a purpo&s;e which he promi&s;ed to com|ply with, as far as he was able, when he learned that they were pri&s;oners e&s;caping from Montoni, whom he had too much rea&s;on to hate. But, though he con&s;ented to lend them fre&s;h hor&s;es to carry them to the next town, he was too poor him&s;elf to tru&s;t them with money, and they were again lamenting their poverty, when Ludovico who had been with his tired hor&s;es to the hovel, which &s;erved for a &s;table, entered the room, half frantic with joy, in which his auditors &s;oon participated. On removing the &s;ad|dle from one of the hor&s;es, he had found beneath it a &s;mall bag, containing, no doubt, the booty of one of the <HI>condottieri,</HI> who had returned from a plundering excur&s;ion, ju&s;t before Ludovico left the ca&s;tle, and who&s;e hor&s;e having &s;trayed from the inner court, while his ma&s;ter was engaged in drinking, had brought away the trea&s;ure, which the ruffian had con&s;idered the reward of his exploit.</P>
<P>On counting over this, Du Pont found that it would be more than &s;ufficient to carry them all to France, where he now deter|mined to accompany Emily, whether he &s;hould obtain intelli|gence
<PB N="17" REF="029378_0235_0FE0852CE1146240">
of his regiment, or not; for, though he had as much con|fidence in the integrity of Ludovico, as his &s;mall knowledge of him allowed, he could not endure the thought of committing her to his care for the voyage; nor, perhaps, had he re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olution enough to deny him&s;elf the dangerous plea&s;ure, which he might derive from her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>He now con&s;ulted them, concerning the &s;ea port, to which they &s;hould direct their way, and Ludovico, better informed of the geography of the country, &s;aid, that Leghorn was the near|e&s;t port of con&s;equence, which Du Pont knew al&s;o to be the mo&s;t likely of any in Italy to a&s;&s;i&s;t their plan, &s;ince from thence ve&s;&s;els of all nations were continually departing. Thither, there|fore, it was determined, that they &s;hould proceed.</P>
<P>Emily, having purcha&s;ed a little &s;traw hat, &s;uch as was worn by the pea&s;ant girls of Tu&s;cany, and &s;ome other little nece&s;&s;ary equipments for the journey, and the travellers, having exchanged their tired hor&s;es for others better able to carry them, recom|menced their joyous way, as the &s;un was ri&s;ing over the moun|tains, and, after travelling through this romantic country, for &s;everal hours, began to de&s;cend into the vale of Arno. And here Emily beheld all the charms of &s;ylvan and pa&s;toral land&s;cape united, adorned with the elegant villas of the Florentine nobles, and diver&s;ified with the various riches of cultivation. How vived the &s;hrubs, that embowered the &s;lopes, with the woods, that &s;tretched amphitheatrically along the mountains! and, above all, how elegant the outline of the&s;e waving Apennines, now &s;often|ing from the wildne&s;s, which their interior regions exhibit|ed! At a di&s;tance, in the ea&s;t, Emily di&s;covered Florence, with its towers ri&s;ing on the brilliant horizon, and its luxuriant plain, &s;preading to the feet of the Apennines, &s;peckled with gardens and magnificent villas, or coloured with groves of orange and lemon, with vines, corn, and plantations of olives and mulberry; while, to the we&s;t, the vale opened to the waters of the Mediterra|nean, &s;o di&s;tant, that they were known only by a bluei&s;h line that appeared upon the horizon, and by the light marine vapour, which ju&s;t &s;tained the aether above.</P>
<P>With a full heart, Emily hailed the waves, that were to bear her back to her native country, the remembrance of which however, brought with it a pang; for &s;he had there no home to receive, no parents to welcome her, but was going, like a for|lorn pilgrim, to weep over the &s;ad &s;pot, where he, who <HI>was</HI> her father, lay interred. Nor were &s;pirits cheered, when &s;he con|&s;idered how long it would probably be before &s;he &s;hould &s;ee Valancourt, who might be &s;tationed with his regiment in a di&s;|tant
<PB N="18" REF="029378_0236_0FE085319C2162B0">
part of France, and that, when they did meet, it would be only to lament the &s;ucce&s;sful villainy of Montoni; yet, &s;till &s;he would have felt inexpre&s;&s;ible delight at the thought of being once more in the &s;ame country with Valancourt, had it even been certain, that &s;he could not &s;ee him.</P>
<P>The inten&s;e heat, for it was now noon, obliged the travellers to look out for a &s;hady rece&s;s, where they might re&s;t, for a few hours, and the neighbouring thickets abounding with wild grapes, ra&s;berries, and figs, promi&s;ed them grateful refre&s;hment. Soon after, they turned from the road into a grove, who&s;e thick foliage entirely excluded the &s;unbeams, and where a &s;pring gu&s;h|ing from a rock, gave coolne&s;s to the air; and, having alighted and turned the hor&s;es to graze, Annette and Ludovico, ran to gather fruit from the &s;urrounding thickets, of which they &s;oon re|turned withan abundance. The travellers &s;eated under the &s;hade of a pine and cypre&s;s grove and on turf, enriched with &s;uch a profu&s;ion of fragrant flowers, as Emily had &s;carcely ever &s;een, even among the Pyrennees, took their &s;imple repa&s;t, and viewed, with new delight, beneath the dark umbrage of gigantic pines, the glowing land&s;cape &s;tretching to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Emily and Du Pont gradually became thoughtful and &s;ilent; but Annette was all joy and loquacity, and Ludovico was gay, without forgetting the re&s;pectful di&s;tance, which was due to his companions. The repa&s;t being over, Du Pont recommended Emily to endeavour to &s;leep, during the&s;e &s;ultry hours, and de&s;iring the &s;ervants would do the &s;ame, &s;aid he would watch the while; but Ludovico wi&s;hed to &s;pare him this trouble; and Emily and Annette wearied with travelling, tried to repo&s;e, while he &s;tood guard with his trombone.</P>
<P>When Emily, refre&s;hed by &s;lumber, awoke, &s;he found the &s;entinel a&s;leep on his po&s;t and Du Pont awake, but lo&s;t in melan|choly thought. As the &s;un was yet too high to allow them to con|tinue their journey, and as it was nece&s;&s;ary, that Ludovico, after the toils and trouble he had &s;uffered, &s;hould fini&s;h his &s;leep, Emily took this opportunity of inquiring by what accident Du Pont became Montoni's pri&s;oner, and he, plea&s;ed with the intere&s;t this inquiry expre&s;&s;ed and with the excu&s;e it gave him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> to her of him&s;elf, immediately an&s;wered her curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>"I came into Italy, madam," &s;aid Du Pont, "in the &s;ervice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my country. In an adventure among the mountains, our party engaging with the bands of Montoni, was routed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> few of my comrades, was taken pri&s;oner. When they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me, who&s;e captive I was, the name of Montoni &s;truck me, for

remembered, that Madame Cheron, your aunt, had married an Italian of that name, and that you had accompanied them into Italy. It was not, however, till &s;ometime after, that I became convinced this was the &s;ame Montoni, or learned, that you madam, was under the &s;ame roof with my&s;elf. I will not pain you by de&s;cribing what were my emotions upon this di&s;covery, which I owed to a &s;entinel, whom I had &s;o far won to my in|tere&s;t, that he granted me many indulgencies, one of which was very important to me, and &s;omewhat dangerous to him&s;elf: but he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to convey any letter, or notice of my &s;ituation to you, for he ju&s;tly dreaded a di&s;covery and the con|&s;equent vengeance of Montoni. He however enabled me to &s;ee you more than once. You are &s;urpri&s;ed, madam, and I will ex|plain my&s;elf. My health and &s;pirits &s;uffered extremely from want of air and exerci&s;e, and, at length, I gained &s;o far upon the pity, or the avarice of the man, that he gave me the means of walking on the terrace."</P>
<P>Emily now li&s;tened, with very anxious attention, to the nar|rative of Du Pont, who proceeded:</P>
<P>"In granting this indulgence, he knew, that he had nothing to apprehend from a chance of my e&s;caping from a ca&s;tle, which was vigilantly guarded, and the neare&s;t terrace of which ro&s;e over a perpendicular rock; he &s;hewed me al&s;o," continued Du Pont, "a door concealed in the cedar wain&s;cot of the apartment where I was confined, which he in&s;tructed me how to open; and which, leading into a pa&s;&s;age, formed within the thickne&s;s of the wall, that extended far along the ca&s;tle, finally opened in an ob&s;cure corner of the ea&s;tern rampart. I have &s;ince been informed, that there are many pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame kind concealed within the prodi|gious walls of that edifice, and which were, undoubtedly contriv|ed for the purpo&s;e of facilitating e&s;capes in time of war. Through this avenue, at the dead of night, I often &s;tole to the terrace, where I walked with the utmo&s;t caution, le&s;t my &s;teps &s;hould betray me to the &s;entinels on duty in di&s;tant parts; for this end of it, being guarded by high buildings, was not watched by &s;oldiers. In one of the&s;e midnight wanderings, I &s;aw light in a ca&s;ement that over|looked the rampart, and which, I ob&s;erved, was immediately over my pri&s;on chamber. It occurred to me, that you might be in that apartment, and, with the hope, of &s;eeing you, I placed my|&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the window."</P>
<P>Emily, remembering the figure that had formerly appeared on the terrace, and which had occa&s;ioned her &s;o much anxiety, ex|claimed, "It was you then, Mon&s;ieur Du Pont, who occa&s;ioned
<PB N="20" REF="029378_0237_0FE085418A4614C8">
me much fooli&s;h terror; my &s;pirits were, at that time, &s;o much weakened by long &s;uffering, that they took alarm at every hint." Du Pont, after lamenting, that he had occa&s;ioned her any ap|prehen&s;ion, added, "As I re&s;ted on the wall, oppo&s;ite to your ca&s;ement, the con&s;ideration of your melancholy &s;ituation, and of my own, called from me involuntary &s;ounds of lamentation, which drew you, I fancy to the ca&s;ement; I &s;aw there a per&s;on, whom I believed to be you. O! I will &s;ay nothing of my emotion at that moment; I wi&s;hed to &s;peak, but prudence re|&s;trained me, till the di&s;tant foot&s;tep of a &s;entinel compelled me &s;uddenly to quit my &s;tation.</P>
<P>"It was &s;ometime, before I had another opportunity of wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing, for I could only leave my pri&s;on, when it happened to be the turn of one man to guard me; meanwhile, I became con|vinced from &s;ome circum&s;tances related by him, that your apart|ment was over-mine, and, when again I ventured forth, I return|ed to your ca&s;ement, where again I &s;aw you, but without dar|ing to &s;peak. I waved my hand, and you &s;uddenly di&s;appear|ed; then it was, that I forgot my prudence, and yielded to la|mentation; again you appeared&mdash;you &s;poke&mdash;I heard the well known accent of your voice! and, at that moment, my di&s;cre|tion would have for&s;aken me again, had I not heard al&s;o the approaching &s;teps of a &s;oldier, when I in&s;tantly quitted the place, though not before the man had &s;een me. He followed down the terrace and gained &s;o fa&s;t upon me, that I was compelled to make u&s;e of a &s;tratagem, ridiculous enough, to &s;ave my&s;elf. I had heard of the &s;uper&s;tition of many of the&s;e men, and I ut|tered a &s;trange noi&s;e, with a hope, that my pur&s;uer would mi&s;|take it for &s;omething &s;upernatural, and de&s;i&s;t from pur&s;uit. Luckily for my&s;elf I &s;ucceeded; the man, it &s;eems, was &s;ubject to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its, and the terror he &s;uffered threw him into one, by which accident I &s;ecured my retreat. A &s;en&s;e of the danger I had e&s;|caped, and the increa&s;ed watchfulne&s;s, which my apearance had occa&s;ioned among the &s;entinels, deterred me ever after from walking on the terrace; but, in the &s;tillne&s;s of night, I fre|quently beguiled my&s;elf with an old lute, procured for me by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oldier, which I &s;ometimes accompanied with my voice, and &s;ometimes, I will acknowledge, with a hope of making my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heard by you; but it was only a few evenings ago, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hope was an&s;wered. I then thought I heard a voice in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wind, calling me; yet, even then I feared to reply, le&s;t the &s;en|tinel at the pri&s;on door &s;hould hear me. Was I right, madam, in this conjecture&mdash;was it you who &s;poke?"</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="029378_0237_0FE085418A4614C8">
"Yes," &s;aid Emily, with an involuntary &s;igh, "you was right indeed."</P>
<P>Du Pont, ob&s;erving the painful emotions, which this que&s;tion revived, now changed the &s;ubject. "In one of my excur&s;ions through the pa&s;&s;age, which I have mentioned, I overheard a &s;in|gular conver&s;ation." &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"In the pa&s;&s;age!" &s;aid Emily, with &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"I heard it in the pa&s;&s;age, &s;aid Du Pont, "but it proceeded from an apartment, adjoining the wall, within which the pa&s;|&s;age wound, and the &s;hell of the wall was there &s;o thin, and was al&s;o &s;omewhat decayed, that I could di&s;tinctly hear every word &s;poken, on the other &s;ide. It happened that Montoni and his companions were a&s;&s;embled in the room, and Montoni began to relate the extraordinary hi&s;tory of the lady, his predece&s;&s;or in the ca&s;tle. He did, indeed, mention &s;ome very &s;urpri&s;ing cir|cum&s;tances, and whether they were &s;trictly true, his con&s;cience mu&s;t decide; I fear it will determine again&s;t him. But you, madam, have doubtle&s;s heard the report, which he de&s;igns &s;hould circulate, on the &s;ubject of that lady's my&s;terious fate."</P>
<P>"I have, &s;ir," replied Emily, "and I perceive, that you doubt it."</P>
<P>"I doubted it before the period I am &s;peaking of," rejoined Du Pont;&mdash;"but &s;ome circum&s;tances mentioned by Montoni, greatly contributed to my &s;u&s;picions. The account I then heard, almo&s;t convinced me, that he was a murderer. I trem|bled for you;&mdash;the more &s;o that I had heard the gue&s;ts mention your name in a manner, that threatened your repo&s;e; and, know|ing, that the mo&s;t impious men are often the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious, I determined to try whether I could not awaken their con&s;ciences, and awe them from the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime I dreaded. I li&s;tened clo&s;ely to Montoni, and, in the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages of his &s;tory, I joined my voice, and repeated his la&s;t words in a di&s;gui&s;ed and hollow tone."</P>
<P>"But was you not afraid of being di&s;covered?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"I was not," replied Du Pont; "for I knew, that, if Mon|toni had been acquainted with the &s;ecret of this pa&s;&s;age, he would not have confined me in the apartment, to which it led. I knew al&s;o, from better authority, that he was ignorant of it. The party, for &s;ometime, appeared inattentive to my voice; but, at length, were &s;o much alarmed, that they quitted the a|partment; and, having heard Montoni order his &s;ervants to &s;earch it, I returned to my pri&s;on, which was very di&s;tant from this part of the pa&s;&s;age." "I remember perfectly to have heard
<PB N="22" REF="029378_0238_0FE085477ACDB9E8">
of the conver&s;ation you mention," &s;aid Emily; "it &s;pread a general alarm among Montoni's people, and I will own I was weak enough to partake of it."</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Du Pont and Emily thus continued to conver&s;e of Montoni, and then of France, and of the plan to their voyage; when Emily told him, that it was her intention to retire to a convent in Languedoc, where &s;he had been formerly treated with much kindne&s;s, and from thence to write to her relation Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel, and inform him of her conduct. There, &s;he de&s;igned to wait, till La Vallee &s;hould again be her own, whi|ther &s;he hoped her income would &s;ometime permit her to return, for Du Pont now taught her to expect, that the e&s;tate of which Montoni had attempted to defraud her was not irrecoverably lo&s;t, and he again congratulated her on her e&s;cape from Montoni, who, he had not a doubt, meant to have detained her for life. The po&s;&s;ibility of recovering her aunt's e&s;tates for Valancourt and her&s;elf lighted up a joy in Emily's heart, &s;uch as &s;he had not known for many months; but &s;he endeavoured to conceal this from Mon&s;ieur Du Pont, le&s;t it &s;hould lead him to a painful re|membrance of his rival.</P>
<P>They continued to conver&s;e, till the &s;un was declining in the we&s;t, when Du Pont awoke Ludovico, and they &s;et forward on their journey. Gradually de&s;cending the lower &s;lopes of the val|ley, they reached the Arno, and wound along its pa&s;toral mar|gin, for many miles, delighted with the &s;cenery around them, and with the remembrances, which its cla&s;&s;ic waves revived. At a di&s;tance, they heard the gay &s;ong of the pea&s;ants among the vineyards, and ob&s;erved the &s;etting &s;un tint the waves with yellow lu&s;tre, and twilight draw a du&s;ky purple over the moun|tains, which, at length, deepened into night. Then the <HI>lucciola</HI> the fire-fly of Tu&s;cany, was &s;een to fla&s;h its &s;udden &s;parks among the foliage, while the <HI>cicala,</HI> with its &s;hrill note, became more Glamorous than even during the noonday heat, loving be&s;t the hour when the Engli&s;h beetle, with le&s;s offen&s;ive &s;ound,

<P>The travellers cro&s;&s;ed the Arno by moonlight, at a ferry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> learning, that Pi&s;a was di&s;tant only a few miles down the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they wi&s;hed to have proceeded thither in a boat, but, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="23" REF="029378_0238_0FE085477ACDB9E8">
could be procured, they &s;et out on their wearied hor&s;es for that city. As they approached it, the vale expanded into a plain, variegated with vineyards, corn, olives and mulberry groves; but it was late, before they reached its gates, where Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear the bu&s;y &s;ound of foot&s;teps and the tones of mu&s;ical in&s;truments, as well as to &s;ee the lively groups, that filled the &s;treets, and &s;he almo&s;t fancied her&s;elf again at Venice; but here was no moonlight &s;ea&mdash;no gay gondolas, da&s;hing the waves,&mdash;no <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> palaces, to throw enchantment over the fancy and lead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the wilds of fairy &s;tory. The Arno rol|led through the town, but no mu&s;ic trembled from Balconies over its waters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gave only the bu&s;y voices of &s;ailors on board ve&s;&s;els ju&s;t arrived from the Mediterranean; the melancholy heav|ing of the anchor, and the &s;hrill boat&s;wain's whi&s;tle; &s;ounds which, &s;ince that period, have there &s;unk almo&s;t into &s;ilence. They then &s;erved to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ind Du Pont, that it was probable he might hear of a ve&s;&s;el, &s;ailing &s;oon to France from this port, and thus be &s;pared the trouble of going to Leghorn. As &s;oon as Emily had reached the inn, he went therefore to the quay, to make his inquiries; but after all the endeavours of him&s;elf and Ludovico, they could hear of no bark, de&s;tined immediately for France, and the travellers returned to their re&s;ting place. Here al&s;o, Du Pont endeavoured to learn where his regiment then lay, but could ac|quire no information concerning it. The travellers retired ear|ly to re&s;t, after the fatigues of this day; and, on the following, ro&s;e early, and, without pau&s;ing to view the celebrated antiquities of the place, or the wonders of its hanging tower, pur&s;ued their journey in the cooler hours, through a charming country, rich with wine, and corn and oil. The Apennines, no longer awful, or even grand, here &s;oftened into the beauty of &s;ylvan and pa&s;|toral land&s;cape; and Emily, as &s;he de&s;cended them, looked down delighted on Leghorn, and its &s;pacious bay, filled with ve&s;&s;els, and crowned with the&s;e beautiful hills.</P>
<P>She was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed and amu&s;ed, on entering this town, to find it crowded with per&s;ons in the dre&s;&s;es of all nations; a &s;cene which reminded her of a Venetian ma&s;querade, &s;uch as &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed at the time of the Carnival; but here, was bu&s;tle, without gaiety, and noi&s;e in&s;tead of mu&s;ic, while elegance was to be looked for only in the waving outlines of the &s;urrounding hills.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Du Pont, immediately on their arrival, went down to the quay, where he heard of &s;everal French ve&s;&s;els, and of one that was to &s;ail in a few days for Mar&s;eilles, from whence another ve&s;&s;el could be procured, without difficulty, to take them acro&s;s the gulf
<PB N="24" REF="029378_0239_0FE085582106D968">
of Lyons towards Narbonne, on the coa&s;t not many leagues from which city he under&s;tood the convent was &s;eated, to which Emily wi&s;hed to retire. He, therefore, immediately engaged with the captain to take them to Mar&s;eilles, and Emily was delighted to hear, that her pa&s;&s;age to France was &s;ecured. Her mind was now relieved from the terror of pur&s;uit, and the plea&s;ing hope of &s;oon &s;eeing her native country&mdash;that country which held Valan|court, re&s;tored to her &s;pirits a degree of cheerfulne&s;s, &s;uch as &s;he had &s;carcely known, &s;ince the death of her father. At Leghorn al&s;o, Du Pont heard of his regiment, and that it had embarked for France; a circum&s;tance, which gave him great &s;atisfaction, for he could now accompany Emily thither, without reproach to his con&s;cience, or apprehen&s;ion of di&s;plea&s;ure from his comman|der. During the&s;e days, he &s;crupulou&s;ly forbore to di&s;tre&s;s her by a mention of his pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he was compelled to e&s;teem and pity, though &s;he could not love him. He endeavoured to amu&s;e her by &s;hewing the environs of the town, and they often walked together on the &s;ea &s;hore, and on the bu&s;y quays, where Emily was frequently intere&s;ted by the arrival and departure of ve&s;&s;els, participating in the joy of meeting friends, and, &s;ometimes, &s;hed|ding a &s;ympathetic tear to the &s;orrow of tho&s;e, that were &s;eparat|ing. It was after having witne&s;&s;ed a &s;cene of the latter kind, that &s;he arranged the following &s;tanzas:</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>THE MARINER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Soft came the breath of &s;pring; &s;mooth flow'd the tide;</L>
<L>And blue the heaven in its mirror &s;mil'd;</L>
<L>The white &s;ail trembled, &s;well'd expanded wide,</L>
<L>The bu&s;y &s;ailors at the anchor toil'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With anxious friends, that &s;hed the parting tear,</L>
<L>The deck was throng'd&mdash;how &s;wift the moments fly!</L>
<L>The ve&s;&s;el heaves, the farewel &s;igns appear;</L>
<L>Mute is each tongue, and eloquent each eye!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The la&s;t dread moment comes!&mdash;The &s;ailor-youth</L>

<P>WE now return to Languedoc and to the mention of Count De Villefort, the nobleman, who &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of the Marquis De Villeroi, &s;ituated near the mona&s;tery of St. Claire. It may be recollected, that this chateau was uninhabited, when St. Aubert and his daughter were in the neighbourhood, and that the former was much affected on di&s;covering him&s;elf to be &s;o near Chateau-le-Blanc, a place, concerning which the good old La V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ion afterwards dropped &s;ome hints, that had alarmed Emily's curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It was in the year 1584, the beginning of that, in which St. Aubert died, that Francis Beauveau, Count De Villefort, came into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the man&s;ion and exten&s;ive domain called Cha|teau-le-Blanc, &s;ituated in the province of Languedoc, on the &s;hore of the Mditerranean. This e&s;tate, which, during &s;ome centuries, had belonged to his family, now de&s;cended to him, on the decea&s;e of his relative, the Marquis De Villeroi, who had been latterly a man of re&s;erved manners and au&s;tere character; cir|cum&s;tances, which, together with the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, that often called him into the field, had prevented any degree of inti|macy with his cou&s;in, the Count De Villefort. For many years, they had known little of each other, and the Count received the fir&s;t intelligence of his death, which happened in a di&s;tant part of France, together with the in&s;truments, that gave him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the domain Chateau-le-Blanc; but it was not till the follow|ing year, that he determined to vi&s;it that e&s;tate, when he de&s;ign|ed to pa&s;s the autumn there. The &s;cenes of Chateau-le-Blanc often came to his remembrance, heightened by the touches, which a warm imagination gives to the recollection of early plea&s;ures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for, many years before, in the lifetime of the Marchione&s;s, and at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> age when the mind is particularly &s;en&s;ible to impre&s;&s;ions of gaiety and delight, he had once vi&s;ited this &s;pot, and though he had pa&s;&s;ed a long intervening period amid&s;t the vexations and tumults of public affairs, which too frequently corrode the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and vitiate the ta&s;te, the &s;hades of Languedoc and the grandeur

of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tant &s;cenery had never been remembered by him with indifference.</P>
<P>During many years, the Chateau had been abandoned by the late Marquis, and, being inhabited only by an old &s;teward and his wife, had been &s;uffered to fall much into decay. To &s;uperintend the repairs, that would be requi&s;ite to make it a comfortable re&s;idence, had been a principal motive with the Count for pa&s;&s;ing the Autumnal months in Languedoc; and neither the remon&s;trances, or the tears of the Counte&s;s, for, on urgent occa&s;ions, &s;he could weep, were powerful enough to over|come his determination. She prepared, therefore, to obey the command which &s;he could not conquer, and to re&s;ign the gay a&s;|&s;emblies of Paris,&mdash;where her beauty was generally unrivalled and won the applau&s;e, to which her wit had but feeble claim&mdash;for the twilight canopy of woods, the lonely grandeur of moun|tains and the &s;olemnity of gothic halls and of long, long galle|ries, which echoed only the &s;olitary &s;tep of a dome&s;tic, or the mea&s;ured clink, that a&s;cended from the great clock&mdash;the ancient monitor of the hall below. From the&s;e melancholy ex|pectations &s;he endeavoured to relieve her &s;pirits by recollecting all that &s;he had ever heard, concerning the joyous vintage of the plains of Languedoc; but there, alas! no airy forms would bound to the gay melody of Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ian dances, and a view of the ru&s;tic fe&s;tivities of pea&s;ants co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> afford little plea&s;ure to a heart, in which even the feelings of ordinary benevolence had long &s;ince decayed under the corruptions of luxury.</P>
<P>The Count had a &s;on and a daughter, the children of a for|mer marriage, who, he de&s;igned, &s;hould accompany him to the &s;outh of France; Henri, who was in his twentieth year, was in the French &s;ervice; and Blanche, who was not yet eighteen, had been hitherto confined to the convent, where &s;he had been placed immediately on her father's &s;econd marriage. The pre&s;ent Counte&s;s, who had neither &s;ufficient ability or inclination to &s;u|perintend the education of her daughter-in-law, had advi&s;ed this &s;tep, and the dread of &s;uperior beauty had &s;ince urged her to employ every art, that might prevail on the Count to prolong the period of Blanche's &s;eclu&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, therefore, with extreme mortifica|tion, that &s;he now under&s;tood that he would no longer &s;ubmit on this &s;ubject, yet it afforded her &s;ome con&s;olation to con&s;ider, that, though the Lady Blanche would emerge from her convent, the &s;hades of the country would, for &s;ometime, veil her beauty from the public eye.</P>
<P>On the morning which commenced the journey, the po&s;tillions &s;topped at the convent, by the Count's order, to take up Blanche,
<PB N="28" REF="029378_0241_0FE0856C3076CCA0">
who&s;e heart beat with delight, at the pro&s;pect of novelty and freedom now before her. As the time of her departure drew nigh, her impatience had increa&s;ed, and the la&s;t night, during which &s;he counted every note of every hour, had appeared the mo&s;t tedious of any &s;he had ever known. The morning light, at length, dawned; the matin bell rang; &s;he heard the nuns de&s;cending from their chambers, and &s;he &s;tarted from a &s;leeple&s;s pillow to welcome the day, which was to emancipate her from the &s;everities of a cloi&s;ter, and introduce her to a world, where plea&s;ure was ever &s;miling, and goodne&s;s ever ble&s;&s;ed&mdash;where, in &s;hort nothing but plea&s;ure and goodne&s;s reigned! When the bell of the great gate rang, and the &s;ound was followed by that of carriage wheels, &s;he ran, with a palpitating heart, to her lat|tice, and perceiving her father's carriage in the court below, danced, with airy &s;teps, along the gallery, where &s;he was met by a nun with a &s;ummons from the abbe&s;s. In the next moment, &s;he was in the parlour, and in the pre&s;ence of the Counte&s;s, who now appeared to her as an angel, that was to lead her into hap|pine&s;s. But the emotions of the Counte&s;s, on beholding her, were not in uni&s;on with tho&s;e of Blanche, who had never appear|ed &s;o lovely as at this moment, when her countenance, animated by the lightning &s;mile of joy, glowed with the beauty of happy innocence.</P>
<P>After conver&s;ing for a few minutes with the abbe&s;s, the Coun|te&s;s ro&s;e to go. This was the moment, which Blanche had an|ticipated with &s;uch eager expectation, the &s;ummit from which &s;he looked down upon the fairy land of happine&s;s, and &s;urveyed all its enchantment; was it a moment, then, for tears of regret? Yet it was &s;o. She turned, with an altered and dejected coun|tenance, to her young companions, who were come to bid her farewel, and wept! Even my lady abbe&s;s, &s;o &s;tately and &s;o &s;o|lemn, &s;he &s;aluted with a degree of &s;orrow, which, an hour be|fore, &s;he would have believed it impo&s;&s;ible to feel, and which may be accounted for by con&s;idering how reluctantly we all part even with unplea&s;ing objects, when the &s;eparation is con&s;ciou&s;ly for ever. Again &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the poor nuns and then followed the Counte&s;s from that &s;pot with tears, which &s;he expected to leave only with &s;miles.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;ence of her father and the variety of objects, on the road, &s;oon engaged her attention, and di&s;&s;ipated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;had<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, which tender regret had thrown upon her &s;pirits. Inattentive to a conver&s;ation, which was pa&s;&s;ing between the Counte&s;s and a Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, her friend, Blanche &s;at, lo&s;t in plea&s;ing re|verie,
<PB N="29" REF="029378_0241_0FE0856C3076CCA0">
as &s;he watched the clouds floating &s;ilently along the blue expan&s;e, now veiling the &s;un and &s;tretching their &s;hadows along the di&s;tant &s;cene, and then di&s;clo&s;ing all his brightne&s;s. The journey continued to give Blanche inexpre&s;&s;ible delight, for new &s;cenes of nature were every in&s;tant opening to her view, and her fancy became &s;tored with gay and beautiful imagery.</P>
<P>It was on the evening of the &s;eventh day, that the travellers came within view of Chateau-le-Blanc, the romantic beauty of who&s;e &s;ituation &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed the imagination of Blanche, who ob&s;erved, with &s;ublime a&s;toni&s;hment, the Pyrenean moun|tains, which had been &s;een only at a di&s;tance during the day, now ri&s;ing within a few leagues, with the wild cliffs and im|men&s;e precipices, which the evening clouds, floating round them now di&s;clo&s;ed, and again veiled. The &s;etting rays, that tinged their &s;nowy &s;ummits with a ro&s;eate hue, touched their lower points with various colouring, while the bluei&s;h tint, that pervad|ed their &s;hadowy rece&s;&s;es, gave the &s;trength of contra&s;t to the &s;plendour of light. The plains of Languedoc, blu&s;hing with the purple vine and diver&s;ified with groves of mulberry, almond and olives, &s;pread far to the north and the ea&s;t; to the &s;outh, ap|peared the Mediterranean, clear as cry&s;tal, and blue as the hea|vens it reflected, bearing on its bo&s;om ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e white &s;ails caught the &s;unbeams, and gave animation to the &s;cene. On a high promontory, wa&s;hed by the waters of the Mediterranean, &s;tood her father's man&s;ion, almo&s;t &s;ecluded from the eye by woods of intermingled pine, oak and che&s;nut, which crowned the emi|nence, and &s;loped towards the plains, on one &s;ide; while on the other, they extended to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance along the &s;ea &s;hores.</P>
<P>As Blanche, drew nearer, the gothic features of this ancient man&s;ion &s;ucce&s;&s;ively appeared&mdash;fir&s;t an embattled turret, ri&s;ing above the trees&mdash;then the broken arch of an immen&s;e gateway, retiring beyond them; and &s;he almo&s;t fancied her&s;elf approach|ing a ca&s;tle, &s;uch as is often celebrated in early &s;tory, where the knights look out from the battlements on &s;ome champion below, who, clothed in black armour, comes with his compan|ions, to re&s;cue the fair lady of his love from the oppre&s;&s;ion of his rival; a &s;ort of legends, to which &s;he had once or twice obtain|ed acce&s;s in the library of her convent, that like many others, belonging to the monks, was &s;tored with the&s;e reliques of ro|mantic fiction.</P>
<P>The carriages &s;topped at a gate, which led into the domain of the chateau, but which was now fa&s;tened; and the great bell,
<PB N="30" REF="029378_0242_0FE08570D587EEB0">
that had formerly &s;erved to announce the arrival of &s;trangers, having long &s;ince fallen from its &s;tation, a &s;ervant climbed over a ruined part of the adjoining wall, to give notice to tho&s;e with|in of the arrival of their lord.</P>
<P>As Blanche leaned from the coach window, &s;he re&s;igned her|&s;elf to the &s;weet and gentle emotions, which the hour and the &s;cenery awakened, the &s;un had now left the earth, and twilight began to darken the mountains; while the di&s;tant waters, re|flecting the blu&s;h that &s;till glowed in the we&s;t, appeared like a line of light, &s;kirting the horizon. The low murmur of waves, breaking on the &s;hore, came in the breeze, and, now and then, the melancholy da&s;hing of oars was feebly heard from a di&s;tance. She was &s;uffered to indulge her pen&s;ive mood, for the thoughts of the re&s;t of the party were &s;ilently engaged upon the &s;ubjects of their &s;everal intere&s;ts. Meanwhile, the Counte&s;s, reflecting with regret, upon the gay parties &s;he had left at Paris, &s;urveyed with di&s;gu&s;t what &s;he thought the gloomy woods and &s;olitary wildne&s;s of the &s;cene; and, &s;hrinking from the pro&s;pect of being &s;hut up in an old ca&s;tle, was prepared to meet every object with di&s;plea&s;ure. The feelings of Henri were &s;omewhat &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Counte&s;s; he gave a mournful &s;igh to the delights of the capital, and to the remembrance of a lady, who, he believed, had engaged his affections, and who had certainly fa&s;cinated his imagination; but the &s;urrounding country, and the mode of life, on which he was entertaining, had, for him, at lea&s;t, the charm of novelty, and his regret was &s;oftened by the gay expectations of youth.</P>
<P>The gates being at length unbarred, the carriage moved &s;low|ly on, under &s;preading che&s;nuts, that almo&s;t excluded the re|mains of day, following what had been formerly a road, but which now overgrown with luxuriant vegetation, could be traced only by the boundary, formed by trees, on either &s;ide, and which wound for near half a mile among the woods, before it reached the chateau. This was the very avenue that St. Aubert and Emily had formerly entered, on their fir&s;t arrival in the neighbourhood, with the hope of finding a hou&s;e that would re|ceive them, for the night, and had &s;o abruptly quitted, on per|ceiving the wildne&s;s of the place, and a figure, which the po&s;|tillion had fancied was a robber.</P>
<P>"What a di&s;mal place is this!" exclaimed the Counte&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the carriage penetrated the deeper rece&s;&s;es of the woods. "Sure|ly my lord, you do not mean to pa&s;s all the autumn in this bar|barous &s;pot! one ought to bring hither a cup of the waters of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="31" REF="029378_0242_0FE08570D587EEB0">
that the remembrance of plea&s;anter &s;cenes may not heighten, at lea&s;t, the the natural drearine&s;s of the&s;e."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall be governed by circum&s;tances, madam," &s;aid the Count, "this barbarous &s;pot was inhabited by my ance&s;tors."</P>
<P>The carriage now &s;topped at the chateau, where at the door of the great hall appeared the old &s;teward and the Pari&s;ian &s;er|vants, who had been &s;ent to prepare the chateau, waiting to re|ceive their lord. Lady Blanche now perceived, that the edifice was not built entirely in the gothic &s;tyle, but that it had addi|tions of a more modern date; the large and gloomy hall, how|ever, into which &s;he now entered, was entirely gothic, and &s;ump|tuous tape&s;try, which it was now too dark to di&s;tingui&s;h, hung upon the walls, and depictured &s;cenes from &s;ome of the ancient Provencal romances. A va&s;t gothic window, embroidered with <HI>clematis</HI> and eglantine, that a&s;cended to the &s;outh, led the eye, now that the ca&s;ements were thrown open, through this verdant &s;hade, over a &s;loping lawn, to the top<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of dark woods, that hung upon the brow of the promontory. Beyond, appeared the waters of the Mediterranean, &s;tretching far to the &s;outh, and to the ea&s;t, where they were lo&s;t in the horizon; while, to the north|ea&s;t, they were bounded by the luxuriant &s;hores of Languedoc and Provence, enriched with wood, and gay with vines and &s;lop|ing pa&s;tures; and to the &s;outh-we&s;t by the maje&s;tic Pyrenees, now fading from the eye, beneath the gradual gloom.</P>
<P>Blanche, as &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the hall, &s;topped a moment to ob&s;erve this lovely pro&s;pect, which the evening twilight ob&s;cured, yet did not conceal. But &s;he was quickly awakened from the compla|cent delight, which this &s;cene had diffu&s;ed upon her mind, by the Counte&s;s, who di&s;contented with every object around, and impatient for refre&s;hment and repo&s;e, ha&s;tened forward to a large parlour, who&s;e cedar wain&s;cot, narrow, pointed ca&s;ements, and dark ceiling of carved cypre&s;s wood, gave it an a&s;pect of peculiar gloom, which the dingy green velvet of the chairs and couches, fringed with tarni&s;hed gold, had once been de&s;igned to enliven,</P>
<P>While the Counte&s;s inquired for refre&s;hment, the Count, at|tended by his &s;on, went to look over &s;ome part of the chateau, and Lady Blanche reluctantly remained to witne&s;s the di&s;con|tent and ill humour of her &s;tep-mother.</P>
<P>"How long have you lived in this de&s;olate place?" &s;aid her lady&s;hip, to the old hou&s;e keeper, who came to pay her duty. "A|bove twenty years, your lady&s;hip, on the next fea&s;t of St. Jerome."</P>
<P>"How happened it, that you have lived here &s;o long, and al|mo&s;t alone, too? I under&s;tood, that the chateau, had been &s;hut up for &s;ome years?"</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="029378_0243_0FE0857FB87FC690">
"Yes, madam, it was for many years after my late lord, the Count, went to the wars; but it is above twenty years, &s;ince; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and my hu&s;band came into his &s;ervice. The place is &s;o large and has of late been &s;o lonely, that we were lo&s;t in it, and, after &s;ometime, we went to live in a cottage at the end of the woods, near &s;ome of the tenants, and came to look after the chateau, every now and then. When my lord returned to France from the wars, he took a di&s;like to the place, and never came to live here again, and &s;o he was &s;atisfied with our remaining at the cot|tage. Alas&mdash;alas! how the chateau is changed from what it once was! What delight my late lady u&s;ed to take in it! I well remember when &s;he came here a bride, and how fine it was.&mdash;Now, it has been neglected &s;o long, and is gone into &s;uch decay! I &s;hall never &s;ee tho&s;e days again!"</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s appearing to be &s;omewhat offended by the thoughtle&s;s &s;implicity, with which the old woman regretted for|mer times, Dorothee added&mdash;"But the chateau will now be in|habited, and cheerful again; not all the world could tempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to live in it alone."</P>
<P>"Well, the experiment will not be made, I believe," &s;aid the Counte&s;s, di&s;plea&s;ed that her own &s;ilence had been unable to awe the loquacity of this ru&s;tic old hou&s;e keeper, now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from further attendance by the entrance of the Count, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had been viewing part of the chateau, and found, that it would require con&s;iderable repairs and &s;ome alterations, before it would be perfectly comfortable, as a place of re&s;idence. "I am &s;orry to hear it, my lord," replied the Counte&s;s. "And why &s;orry, madam?" "Becau&s;e the place will ill repay your trouble; and were it even a paradi&s;e, it would be In&s;ufferable at &s;uch a di&s;|tance from Paris."</P>
<P>The Count made no reply, but walked abruptly to a window. "There are windows, my lord, but they neither admit enter|tainment, or light; they &s;hew only a &s;cene of &s;avage nature."</P>
<P>"I am at a lo&s;s, madam," &s;aid the Count, "to conjecture what you mean by &s;avage nature. Do tho&s;e plains, or tho&s;e woods, or that fine expan&s;e of water, de&s;erve the name?"</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e mountains certainly do, my lord," rejoined the Coun|te&s;s, pointing to the Pyrenees, "and this chateau, though not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> work of rude nature, is to my ta&s;te, at lea&s;t one of &s;avage art. The Count coloured highly. "This place, madam, was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> work of my ance&s;tors," &s;aid he, "and you mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that your pre&s;ent conver&s;ation di&s;covers neither good ta&s;te, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> good manners." Blanche, now &s;hocked at an altercation, which

appeared to be increa&s;ing to a &s;erious di&s;agreement, ro&s;e to leave the room, when her mother's woman entered it; and the Coun|te&s;s immediately de&s;iring to be &s;hewn to her own apartment, withdrew, attended by Mademoi&s;elle Bearn.</P>
<P>Lady Blanche it being not yet dark, took this opportunity of exploring new &s;cenes, and leaving the parlour, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed from the hall into a wide gallery, who&s;e walls were decorated by marble pila&s;ters, which &s;upported an arched roof, compo&s;ed of a rich mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aic work. Through a di&s;tant window, that &s;eemed to ter|minate the gallery, were &s;een the purple clouds of evening and a land&s;cape, who&s;e features, thinly veiled in twilight, no longer appeared di&s;tinctly, but, blended into one grand ma&s;s, &s;tretched to the horizon, coloured only with a tint of &s;olemn grey.</P>
<P>The gallery terminated in a &s;aloon, to which the window &s;he had &s;een through an open door, belonged; but the increa&s;ing du&s;k permitted her only an imperfect view of this apartment, which &s;eemed to be magnificent and of modern architecture; though it had been either &s;uffered to fall into decay, or had never been properly fini&s;hed. The windows, which were numerous and large, de&s;cended low, and afforded a very exten&s;ive, and what Blanche's fancy repre&s;ented to be, a very lovely pro&s;pect; and &s;he &s;tood for &s;ometime, &s;urveying the grey ob&s;curity, and de|picturing imaginary woods and mountains, vallies and rivers, on this &s;cene of night; her &s;olemn &s;en&s;ations rather a&s;&s;i&s;ted, than interrupted, by the di&s;tant bark of a watch dog, and by the breeze, as it trembled upon the light foliage of the &s;hrubs. Now and then appeared for a moment, among the woods, a cottage light; and, at length, was heard, afar off, the evening bell of a convent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lying on the air. When &s;he withdrew her thoughts from the&s;e &s;ubjects of fanciful delight, the gloom and &s;ilence of the &s;aloon &s;omewhat awed her; and, having &s;ought the door of the gallery, and pur&s;ued, for a con&s;iderable time, a dark pa&s;&s;age, &s;he came to a hall, but one totally different from that &s;he had formerly &s;een. By the twilight, admitted through an open portico, &s;he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tingui&s;h this apartment to be of very light and airy ar|chitecture, and that it was paved with white marble, pillars of which &s;upported the roof, that ro&s;e into arches built in the Moori&s;h &s;tyle. While Blanche &s;tood on the &s;teps of this portico, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he moon ro&s;e over the &s;ea, and gradually di&s;clo&s;ed, in partial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, the beauties of the eminence, on which &s;he &s;tood, whence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lawn, now rude and overgrown with high gra&s;s, &s;loped to the woods, that almo&s;t &s;urrounding the chateau, extended in a grand

&s;weep down the &s;outhern &s;ides of the promontory to the very&punc; margin of the ocean. Beyond the woods, on the north &s;ide, ap|peared a long tract of the plains of Languedoc; and to the ca&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, the land&s;cape &s;he had before dimly &s;een, with the towers of a mona&s;tery, illumined by the moon, ri&s;ing over dark groves.</P>
<P>The &s;oft and &s;hadowy tint, that over&s;pread the &s;cene, the waves, undulating in the moonlight, and their low and mea&s;ur|ed murmurs on the beach, were circum&s;tances, that united to elevate the unaccu&s;tomed mind of Blanche to enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>"And have I lived in this glorious world &s;o long," &s;aid &s;he, "and never till now beheld &s;uch a pro&s;pect&mdash;never experienced the&s;e delights! Every pea&s;ant girl, on my father's domain, has viewed from her infancy the face of nature; has ranged, at li|berty, her romantic wilds, while I have been &s;hut in a cloi&s;ter from the view of the&s;e beautiful appearances, which were de|&s;igned to enchant all eyes, and awaken all hearts. How can the poor nuns and friars feel the full fervour of devotion, if they ne|ver &s;ee the &s;un ri&s;e, or &s;et? Never, till this evening, did I know what true devotion is; for, never before did I &s;ee the &s;un &s;ink below the va&s;t earth! To-morrow, for the fir&s;t time in my life, I will &s;ee it ri&s;e. O who would live in Paris, to look upon black walls, and dirty &s;treets, when, in the country, they might gaze on the blue heavens, and all the green earth!"</P>
<P>This enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;oliloquy was interrupted by a ru&s;tling noi&s;e in the hall; and, while the loneline&s;s of the place made her &s;en|&s;ible to fear, &s;he thought &s;he perceived &s;omething moving be|tween the pillars. For a moment &s;he continued &s;ilently ob&s;erv|ing it, till a&s;hamed of her ridiculous apprehen&s;ions, &s;he recol|lected courage enough to demand who was there. "O my young lady, is it you?" &s;aid the old hou&s;ekeeper, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;hut the windows, "I am glad it is you." The manner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which &s;he &s;poke this, with a faint breath, rather &s;urpri&s;ed Blanche, who &s;aid, "You &s;eemed frightened, Dorothee, what is the mat|ter?"</P>
<P>"No, not frightened, ma'am&s;elle," replied Dorothee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and trying to appear compo&s;ed, "but I am old, and&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> matter &s;tartles me."

"I am glad that my lord the Count is come to live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the chateau, ma'am&s;elle," continued Dorothee, "for it has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> many a year de&s;erted, and dreary enough; now, the place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> look a little as it u&s;ed to do, when my poor lady was alive Blanche inquired how long it was, &s;ince the Marchione&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> "Alas! my lady," rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led Dorothee, "&s;o long&mdash;that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>Blanche inquired how long this part of the edifice had been built. "Soon after my lord's marriage, ma'am," replied Do|rothee. "The place was large enough without this addition, for many rooms of the old building were even then never made u&s;e of, and my lord had a princely hou&s;ehold too; but he thought the ancient man&s;ion gloomy, and gloomy enough it is!" Lady Blanche now de&s;ired to be &s;hewn to the inhabited part of the chateau; and, as the pa&s;&s;ages were intirely dark, Dorothee conducted her along the edge of the lawn to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the edifice, where a door opening into the great hall, &s;he was met by Mademoi&s;elle Bearn. "Where have you been &s;o long?" &s;aid &s;he, "I had begun to think &s;ome wonderful adventure had befallen you, and that the giant of this enchanted ca&s;tle, or the gho&s;t, which, no doubt, haunts it, had conveyed you through a trap-door into &s;ome &s;ubterranean vault, whence you was never to return."</P>
<P>"No," replied Blanche, laughingly, "you &s;eem to love ad|ventures &s;o well, that I leave them for you to achieve."</P>
<P>"Well, I am willing to achieve them, provided I am allowed to de&s;cribe them."</P>
<P>"My dear Mademoi&s;elle Bearn," &s;aid Henri, as he met her at the door of the parlour, "no gho&s;t of the&s;e days would be &s;o &s;avage as to impo&s;e &s;ilence on you. Our gho&s;ts are more civil|ized than to condemn a lady to a purgatory &s;everer even than their own, be it what it may."</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle Bearn replied only by a laugh; and the Count now entering the room, &s;upper was &s;erved, during which he &s;poke little, frequently appeared to be ab&s;tracted from the com|pany, and more than once remarked, that the place was greatly altered, &s;ince he had la&s;t &s;een it. "Many years have intervened &s;ince that period," &s;aid he; "and, though the grand features of the &s;cenery admit of no change, they impre&s;s me with &s;en&s;a|tions very different from tho&s;e I formerly experienced."</P>
<P>"Did the&s;e &s;cenes, &s;ir," &s;aid Blanche, "ever appear more lovely, than they do now? To me this &s;eems hardly po&s;&s;ible." The Count, regarding her with a melancholy &s;mile, &s;aid, they once were as delightful to me, as they are now to you; the land&s;cape is not changed, but time has changed me; from my mind the illu&s;ion, which gave &s;pirit to the colouring of nature, is fading fa&s;t! If you live, my dear Blanche, to revi&s;it this

&s;pot, at the di&s;tance of many years, you will, perhaps, remem|ber and under&s;tand the feelings of your father."</P>
<P>Lady Blanche, affected by the&s;e words, remained &s;ilent; &s;he looked forward to the period, which the Count anticipated, and con&s;idering, that he who now &s;poke, would then probably be no more, her eyes bent to the ground, were filled with tears.&mdash;She gave her hand to her father, who &s;miling affectionately, ro&s;e from his chair, and went to a window to conceal his emotion.</P>
<P>The fatigues of the day made the party &s;eparate at an early hour, when Blanche retired through a long oak gallery to her chamber, who&s;e &s;pacious and lofty walls, high antiquated ca&s;e|ments, and, what was the effect of the&s;e, its gloomy air, did not re|concile her to its remote &s;ituation, in this ancient building. The furniture, al&s;o, was of ancient date; the bed was of blue dama&s;k, trimmed with tarni&s;hed gold lace, and its lofty te&s;ter ro&s;e in the form of a canopy, whence the curtains de&s;cended, like tho&s;e of &s;uch tents as are &s;ometimes repre&s;ented in old pictures, and, in|deed, much re&s;embling tho&s;e, exhibited on the faded tape&s;try, with which the chamber was hung. To Blanche, every object here was matter of curio&s;ity; and, taking the light from her woman to examine the tape&s;try, &s;he perceived, that it repre&s;ent|ed &s;cenes from the wars of Troy, though the almo&s;t colourle&s;s wor&s;ted now mocked the glowing actions they once had painted. She laughed at the ludicrous ab&s;urdity &s;he ob&s;erved, till recol|lecting, that the hands, which had wove it, were, like the poet, who&s;e thoughts of fire they had attempted to expre&s;s, long &s;ince mouldered into du&s;t, a train of melancholy ideas pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, and &s;he almo&s;t wept.</P>
<P>Having given her woman a &s;trict injunction to awaken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, before &s;unri&s;e, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her; and then, to di&s;&s;ipate the gloom which reflection had ca&s;t upon her &s;pirits, opened one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> high ca&s;ements, and was again cheered by the face of living <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The &s;hadowy earth, the air, and ocean&mdash;all was &s;till. A|long the deep &s;erene of the heavens, a few light clouds floated &s;lowly, through who&s;e &s;kirts the &s;tars now &s;eemed to tremble, and now to emerge with purer &s;plendour. Blanche's thoughts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> involuntarily to the great Author of the &s;ublime objects &s;he con|templated, and &s;he breathed a prayer of finer devotion, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had ever uttered beneath the vaulted roof of a cloi&s;ter. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this ca&s;ement, &s;he remained till the glooms of midnight were &s;tretch|ed over the pro&s;pect.

<P>BLANCHE's &s;lumbers continued, till long after the hour, which &s;he had &s;o impatiently anticipated, for her woman, fatigu|ed with travelling, did not call her, till breakfa&s;t was nearly ready. Her di&s;appointment, however was in&s;tantly forgotten, when, on opening the ca&s;ement, &s;he &s;aw on one hand, the wide &s;ea &s;parkling in the morning rays, with its &s;tealing &s;ails and glancing oars; and on the other, the fre&s;h woods, the plains far &s;tretching and the blue mountains, all glowing with the &s;plen|dour of day.</P>
<P>As &s;he in&s;pired the pure breeze, health &s;pread a deeper blu&s;h upon her countenance, and plea&s;ure danced in her eyes.</P>
<P>"Who could fir&s;t invent convents!" &s;aid &s;he, "and who could fir&s;t per&s;uade people to go into them? and to make religion a pretence, too, where all that &s;hould in&s;pire it, is &s;o carefully &s;hut out! God is be&s;t plea&s;ed with the homage of a grateful heart, and, when we view his glories, we feel mo&s;t grateful. I never felt &s;o much devotion, during the many dull years I was in the convent, as I have done in the few hours that I have been here, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re I need only look on all around me, to adore God in my inmo&s;t heart."</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he left the window, bounded along the gallery, and, in the next moment, was in the breakfa&s;t room, where the Count was already &s;eated. The cheerfulne&s;s of a bright &s;un&s;hine had di&s;per&s;ed the melancholy glooms of his reflections, a plea&s;ant &s;mile was on his countenance, and he &s;poke in an enlivening voice to Blanche, who&s;e heart echoed back the tones. Henri and, &s;oon after, the Counte&s;s with Mademoi&s;elle Bearn appeared, and the whole party &s;eemed to acknowledge the influence of the &s;cene; even the Counte&s;s was &s;o much reanimated as to receive the civilities of her hu&s;band with complacency, and but once for|got her good humour, which was when &s;he a&s;ked whether they had any neighbours, who were likely to make <HI>this barbarous &s;pot</HI> more tolerable, and whether the Count believed it po&s;&s;ible for her to exi&s;t here, without &s;ome amu&s;ement?"</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029378_0246_0FE085979F861950">
Soon after breakfa&s;t the party di&s;per&s;ed; the Count, ordering his &s;teward to attend him in the library, went to &s;urvey the con|dition of his premi&s;es, and to vi&s;it &s;ome of his tenants; Henri ha&s;tened with alacrity to the &s;hore to examine a boat, that was to bear them on a little voyage in the evening and to &s;uperintend the adju&s;tment of a &s;ilk awning; while the Counte&s;s, attended by Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, retired to an apartment on the modern &s;ide of the chateau, which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itted up with airy elegance; and, as the windows opened upon balconies, that fronted the &s;ea, &s;he was there &s;aved from a view of the <HI>horrid</HI> Pyrenees. Here, while &s;he reclined on a &s;ofa, and, ca&s;ting her languid eyes over the ocean, which appeared beyond the wood tops, indulged in the luxuries of <HI>ennui,</HI> her companion read aloud a &s;entimental novel, on &s;ome fa&s;hionable &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, for the Counte&s;s was her&s;elf &s;omewhat of a <HI>philo&s;opher,</HI> e&s;pecially as to <HI>infidelity,</HI> and among a certain circle her opinions were waited for with impatience, and received as doctrines.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, ha&s;tened to indulge, amid&s;t the wild wood walks around the chateau, her new enthu&s;ia&s;m, where, as &s;he wandered under the &s;hades, her gay &s;pirits gradual|ly yielded to pen&s;ive complacency. Now, &s;he moved with &s;ol|emn &s;teps, beneath the gloom of thickly interwoven branches, where the fre&s;h dew &s;till hung upon every flower, that peeped from among the gra&s;s; and now tripped &s;portively along the path, on which the &s;unbeams darted and the checquered foliage trembled&mdash;where the tender greens of the beech, the acacia and the mountain a&s;h, mingling with the &s;olemn tints of the cedar, the pine and cypre&s;s, exhibited as fine a contra&s;t of colouring, as the maje&s;tic oak and oriental plane did of form, to the feathery lightne&s;s of the cork tree and the waving grace of the poplar.</P>
<P>Having reached a ru&s;tic &s;eat, within a deep rece&s;s of the woods &s;he re&s;ted awhile, and, as her eyes caught, through a di&s;tant open|ing, a glimp&s;e of the blue waters of the Mediterranean, with the white &s;ail, gliding on its bo&s;om, or of the broad mountain, glow|ing beneath the mid-day &s;un, her mind experienced &s;omewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that exqui&s;ite delight, which awakens the fancy, and leads <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> poetry.

<P>When Lady Blanche returned to the chateau, in&s;tead of go|ing to the apartment of the Counte&s;s, &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf with wandering over that part of the edifice, which &s;he had not yet examined, of which the mo&s;t ancient fir&s;t attracted her curio&s;i|ty; for though what &s;he had &s;een of the modern, was gay and elegant, there was &s;omething in the former more intere&s;ting to her imagination. Having pa&s;&s;ed up the great &s;tairca&s;e, and through the oak gallery, &s;he entered upon a long &s;uite of cham|bers, who&s;e walls were either hung with tape&s;try, or wain&s;coted with cedar, the furniture of which lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ked almo&s;t as ancient as the rooms them&s;elves; the &s;pacious fire places, where no mark of &s;ocial cheer remained, pre&s;ented an image of cold de&s;olation; and the whole &s;uite had &s;o much the air of neglect and de&s;er|tion, that it &s;eemed, as if the venerable per&s;ons, who&s;e portraits hung upon the walls, had been the la&s;t to inhabit them,</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="029378_0247_0FE085A35D784FC0">
On leaving the&s;e rooms, &s;he found her&s;elf in another gallery, one end of which was terminated by a back &s;tairca&s;e, and the other by a door, that &s;eemed to communicate with the north &s;ide of the chateau, but which being fa&s;tened, &s;he de&s;cended the &s;tair|ca&s;e, and opening a door in the wall, a few &s;teps down, found her|&s;elf in a &s;mall &s;quare room, that formed part of the we&s;t turret of the ca&s;tle. Three windows pre&s;ented each a &s;eparate and beautiful pro&s;pect; that to the north overlooking Languedoc; another to the we&s;t, the hills a&s;cending towards the Pyrenees, who&s;e awful &s;ummits crowned the land&s;cape; and a third, fronting the &s;outh, gave the Mediterranean, and a part of the wild &s;hores of Rou&s;illon, to the eye.</P>
<P>Having left the turret, and de&s;cended the narrow &s;tairca&s;e, &s;he found her&s;elf in a du&s;ky pa&s;&s;age, where &s;he wandered, unable to find her way, till impatience yielded to apprehen&s;ion, and &s;he called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Pre&s;ently &s;teps approached, and light glimmered through a door at the other extremity of the pa&s;|&s;age, which was opened with caution by &s;ome per&s;on, who did not venture beyond it, and whom Blanche ob&s;erved in &s;ilence, till the door was clo&s;ing, when &s;he called aloud, and ha&s;tening towards it, perceived the old hou&s;ekeeper.</P>
<P>"Dear ma'am&s;elle! is it you?" &s;aid Dorothee, "How could you find your way hither?" Had Blanche been le&s;s occupied by her own fears, &s;he would probably have ob&s;erved the &s;trong ex|pre&s;&s;ions of terror and &s;urpri&s;e on Dorothee's countenance, who now led her through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ages and rooms, that looked as if they had been uninhabited for a century, till they reached that appropriated to the hou&s;ekeeper, where Dorothee entreated &s;he would &s;it down and take refre&s;hment. Blanche ac|cepted the &s;weet meats, offered to her, mentioned her di&s;covery of the plea&s;ant turret, and her wi&s;h to appropriate it to her own u&s;e. Whether Dorothee's ta&s;te was not &s;o &s;en&s;ible to the beau|ties of land&s;cape as her young lady's, or that the con&s;tant view of lovely &s;cenery had deadened it, &s;he forbore to prai&s;e the &s;ub|ject of Blanche's enthu&s;ia&s;m, which, however, her &s;ilence did not repre&s;s. To Lady Blanche's inquiry, of whither the door &s;he had found fa&s;tened at the end of the gallery led, &s;he replied, that it opened to a &s;uite of rooms, which had not been entered, dur|ing many years, "For," added &s;he, "my late lady died in one of them, and I could never find in my heart to go into them &s;ince."</P>
<P>Blanche, though &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee the&s;e chambers, forbore, on ob&s;erving that Dorothee's eyes were filled with tears, to a&s;k her to unlock them, and, &s;oon after, went to dre&s;s for dinner, at
<PB N="42" REF="029378_0248_0FE085A906747358">
which the whole party met in good &s;pirits and good humour, except the Counte&s;s, who&s;e vacant mind, overcome by the lan|guor of idlene&s;s, would neither &s;uffer her to be happy her&s;elf, or to contribute to the happine&s;s of others. Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, attempting to be witty, directed her <HI>badinage</HI> again&s;t Henri, who an&s;wered, becau&s;e he could not well avoid it, rather than from any inclination to notice her, who&s;e liveline&s;s &s;ometimes amu&s;ed, but who&s;e conceit and in&s;en&s;ibility often di&s;gu&s;ted him.</P>
<P>The cheerfulne&s;s, with which Blanche rejoined the party, van|i&s;hed, on her reaching the margin of the &s;ea; &s;he gazed with apprehen&s;ion upon the immen&s;e expan&s;e of waters, which, at a di&s;tance, &s;he had beheld only with delight and a&s;toni&s;hment, and it was by a &s;trong effort, that &s;he &s;o far overcame her fears, as to follow her father into the boat.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;ilently &s;urveyed the va&s;t horizon, bending round the di&s;tant verge of the ocean, an emotion of &s;ublime&s;t rapture &s;trug|gled to overcome a &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal danger. A light breeze played on the water, and on the &s;ilk awning of the boat, and waved the foliage of the receding woods, that crowned the cliffs, for many miles, and which the Count &s;urveyed with the pride of con&s;cious property, as well as with the eye of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance, among the&s;e woods, &s;tood a pavilion, which had once been the &s;cene of &s;ocial gaiety, and which its &s;ituation &s;till made one of romantic beauty. Thither, the Count had or|dered coffee and other refre&s;hment to be carried, and thither the &s;ailors now &s;teered their cour&s;e, following the windings of the &s;hore round many a woody promontory and circling bay; while the pen&s;ive tones of horns and other wind in&s;truments, played by the attendants in a di&s;tant boat, echoed among the rocks, and di|ed along the waves. Blanche had now &s;ubdued her fears; a de|lightful tranquillity &s;tole over her mind, and held her in &s;ilence; and &s;he was too happy even to remember the convent, or her former &s;orrows, as &s;ubjects of compari&s;on with her pre&s;ent felicity.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s felt le&s;s unhappy than &s;he had done, &s;ince the moment of her leaving Paris; for her mind was now under &s;ome degree of re&s;traint; &s;he feared to indulge its wayward humours, and even wi&s;hed to recover the Count's good opinion. On his family, and on the &s;urrounding &s;cene, he looked with tempered plea&s;ure and benevolent &s;atisfaction, while his &s;on exhibited the gay &s;pirits of youth, anticipating new delights, and regretle&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e, that were pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After near an hour's rowing, the party landed and a&s;cended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little path, overgrown with vegetation. At a little di&s;tance from
<PB N="43" REF="029378_0248_0FE085A906747358">
the point of the eminence, within the &s;hadowy rece&s;s of the woods, appeared the pavilion, which Blanche perceived, as &s;he caught a glim&s;e of its portico between the trees, to be built of variegated marble. As &s;he followed the Counte&s;s, &s;he often turned her eyes with rapture towards the ocean, &s;een beneath the dark foliage, far below, and from thence upon the deep woods, who&s;e &s;ilence and impenetrable gloom awakened emotions more &s;olemn but &s;carcely le&s;s delightful.</P>
<P>The pavilion had been prepared, as far as was po&s;&s;ible, on a very &s;hort notice, for the reception of its vi&s;itors but the faded colours of its painted walls and ceiling, and the decayed drape|ry of its once magnificent furniture, declared how long it had been neglected, and abandoned to the empire of the changing &s;ea&s;ons. While the party partook of a collation of fruit and cof|fee, the horns placed in a di&s;tant part of the woods, where an echo &s;weetened and prolonged their melancholy tones, broke &s;oftly on the &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene. This &s;pot &s;eemed to attract even the admiration of the Counte&s;s, or, perhaps, it was merely the plea&s;ure of planning furniture and decorations, that made her dwell &s;o long on the nece&s;&s;ity of repairing and adorning it; while the Count, never happier than when he &s;aw her mind en|gaged by natural and &s;imple objects, acquie&s;ced in all her de|&s;igns concerning the pavilion.</P>
<P>The paintings on the walls and coved ceiling were to be re|newed; the canopies and &s;ofas were to be of light green da|ma&s;k; marble &s;tatues of wood nymphs, bearing on their heads ba&s;kets of living flowers, were to adorn the rece&s;&s;es between the windows, which, de&s;cending to the ground, were to admit to every part of the room, and it was of octagonal form, the various land&s;cape. One window opened upon a romantic glade, where the eye roved among woody rece&s;&s;es, and the &s;cene was bounded only by a lengthened pomp of groves; from an|other, the woods receding di&s;clo&s;ed the di&s;tant &s;ummits of the Pyrenees; a third fronted an avenue, beyond which the grey towers of Chateu-le-Blanc, and a picture&s;que part of its ruin were &s;een partially among the foliage; while a fourth gave between the trees, a glimp&s;e of the green pa&s;tures and villages, that diver&s;ify the banks of the Aude. The Mediterranean, with the bold cliffs, that overlooked its &s;hores, were the grand ob|jects of a fifth window, and the others gave in different points of view, the wild &s;cenery of the woods.</P>
<P>After wandering, for &s;ometime, in the&s;e the party returned to the &s;hore and embarked; and, the beauty of the evening
<PB N="44" REF="029378_0249_0FE085B6F9A0A7B0">
tempting them to extend their excur&s;ion, they proceeded further up the bay. A dead calm had &s;ucceeded the light breeze, that wafted them hither, and the men took to their oars. Around, the waters were &s;pread into one va&s;t expan&s;e of poli&s;hed mirror, reflecting the grey cliffs and feathery woods, that overhung its &s;urface, the glow of the we&s;tern horizon and the dark clouds, that came &s;lowly from the ea&s;t. Blanche loved to &s;ee the dip|ping oars imprint the water, and to watch the &s;preading circles they left, which gave a tremulous motion to the reflected land|&s;cape, without de&s;troying the harmony of its features.</P>
<P>Above the darkne&s;s of the woods, her eye now caught a clu&s;|ter of high towers, touched with the &s;plendour of the &s;etting rays; and, &s;oon after, the horns being then &s;ilent, &s;he heard the faint &s;well of choral voices from a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>"What voices are tho&s;e, upon the air?" &s;aid the Count, look|ing round, and li&s;tening; but the &s;train had cea&s;ed. "It &s;eem|ed to be a ve&s;per hymn, which I have often heard in my con|vent," &s;aid Blanche.</P>
<P>"We are near the mona&s;tery, then," ob&s;erved the Count; and, the boat &s;oon after doubling a lofty head land, the mona&s;|tery of St. Claire, appeared, &s;eated near the margin of the &s;ea, where the cliffs &s;uddenly &s;inking, formed a low &s;hore within a &s;mall bay, almo&s;t encircled with woods, among which partial fea|tures of the edifice were &s;een; the great gate and gothic win|dow of the hall, the cloi&s;ters and the &s;ide of a chapel more re|mote; while a venerable arch, which had once led to a part of the fabric, now demoli&s;hed, &s;tood a maje&s;tic ruin detached from the main building, beyond which appeared a grand per&s;pective of the woods. On the grey walls, the mo&s;s had fa&s;tened, and, round the pointed windows of the chapel, the ivy and the bri|ony hung in many a fanta&s;tic wreath.</P>
<P>All without was &s;ilent and for&s;aken; but while Blanche gaz|ed with admiration on this venerable pile, who&s;e effect was heightened by the &s;trong lights and &s;hadows thrown athwart it by a cloudy &s;un&s;et, a &s;ound of many voices, &s;lowly chanting, aro&s;e from within. The Count bade his men re&s;t on their oars. The monks were &s;inging the hymn of ve&s;pers, and &s;ome female voices mingled with the &s;train, which ro&s;e by &s;oft degrees, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> high organ and the choral &s;ounds &s;welled into full and &s;olemn harmony. The &s;train, &s;oon after, dropped into &s;udden &s;ilence, and was renewed in a low and &s;till more &s;olemn key, till, at length, the holy chorus died away, and was heard no more.&mdash;Blanche &s;ighed, tears trembled in her eyes, and her thoughts

&s;eemed wafted with the &s;ounds to heaven. While a rapt &s;tillne&s;s prevailed in the boat, a train of friars, and then of nuns, veiled in white, i&s;&s;ued from the cloi&s;ters, and pa&s;&s;ed under the &s;hade of the woods, to the main body of the edifice.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was the fir&s;t of her party to awaken from this pau&s;e of &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"The&s;e di&s;mal hymns and friars make one quite melancho|ly," &s;aid &s;he; "twilight is coming on; pray let us return, or it will be dark before we get home."</P>
<P>The Count, looking up, now perceived, that the twilight of evening was anticipated by an approaching &s;torm. In the ea&s;t a tempe&s;t was collecting; a heavy gloom came on, oppo&s;ing and contra&s;ting the glowing &s;plendour of the &s;etting &s;un. The cla|mourous &s;ea fowl &s;kimmed in fleet circles upon the &s;urface of the &s;ea, dipping their light pinions in the wave, as they fled away in &s;earch of &s;helter. The boatmen pulled hard at their oars; but the thunder, that now muttered at a di&s;tance, and the heavy drops that began to dimple the water, made the Count deter|mine to put back to the mona&s;tery for &s;helter and the cour&s;e of the boat was immediately changed. As the clouds approached the we&s;t, their lurid darkne&s;s changed to a deep ruddy glow, which, by reflection, &s;eemed to fire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the tops of the woods and the &s;hattered towers of the mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>The appearance of the heavens alarmed the Counte&s;s and Ma|demoi&s;elle Bearn, who&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of apprehen&s;ion di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Count, and perplexed his men; while Blanche continued &s;ilent, now agitated with fear, and now with admiration, as &s;he view|ed the grandeur of the clouds, and their effect on the &s;cenery, and li&s;tened to the long, long peals of thunder, that rolled through the air.</P>
<P>The boat having reached the lawn before the mona&s;tery, the Count &s;ent a &s;ervant to announce his arrival, and to entreat &s;hel|ter of the Superior, who, &s;oon after, appeared at the great gate, attended by &s;everal monks, while the &s;ervant returned with a me&s;&s;age, expre&s;&s;ive at once of ho&s;pitality and pride, but of pride di&s;gui&s;ed in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The party immediately di&s;embarked, and, having ha&s;tily cro&s;&s;ed the lawn&mdash;for the &s;hower was now heavy&mdash;were received at the gate by the Superior, who, as they entered, &s;tretched forth his hands and gave his ble&s;&s;ing; and they pa&s;&s;ed into the great hall, were the lady abbe&s;s waited, attended by &s;everal nuns, clothed, like her&s;elf, in black, and veiled in white. The veil of the abbe&s;s was, however, thrown half back,
<PB N="46" REF="029378_0250_0FE085BB8EAB5B18">
and di&s;covered a countenance, who&s;e cha&s;te dignity was &s;weet|ened by the &s;mile of welcome, with which &s;he addre&s;&s;ed the Counte&s;s, whom &s;he led, with Blanche and Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, into the convent parlour, while the Count and Henri were con|ducted by the Superior to the refectory.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, fatigued and di&s;contented, received the polite|ne&s;s of the Abbe&s;s with carele&s;s haughtine&s;s, and had followed her with indolent &s;teps to the parlour, over which the painted ca&s;ements and wain&s;cot of larch-wood threw, at all times, a me|lancholy &s;hade, and where the gloom of evening now loured al|mo&s;t to darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>While the lady Abbe&s;s ordered refre&s;hment, and conver&s;ed with the Counte&s;s, Blanche withdrew to a window, the lower panes of which, being without painting allowed her to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the &s;torm over the Mediterranean, who&s;e dark waves that had &s;o lately &s;lept, now came boldly &s;welling, in long &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, to the &s;hore, where they bur&s;t in white foam, and threw up a high &s;pray over the rocks. A red &s;ulphurous tint over|&s;pread the long line of clouds, that hung above the we&s;tern ho|rizon, beneath who&s;e dark &s;kirts the &s;un looking out, illumin|ed the di&s;tant &s;hores of Languedoc, as well as the tufted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the nearer woods, and &s;hed a partial gleam on the we&s;|tern waves. The re&s;t of the &s;cene was in deep gloom, except where a &s;unbeam, darting between the clouds, glanced on the white wings of the &s;ea-fowl, that circled high among them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> touched the &s;welling &s;ail of a ve&s;&s;el, which was &s;een labouring in&punc; the &s;torm. Blanche, for &s;ometime, anxiou&s;ly watched the progre&s;s of the bark, as it threw the waves in foam around <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and, as the lightnings fla&s;hed, looked to the opening heaven with many a &s;igh for the fate of the poor mariners.</P>
<P>The &s;un, at length, &s;et, and the heavy clouds, which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> impended, dropped over the &s;plendour of his cour&s;e; the ve&s;&s;el however, was yet dimly &s;een, and Blanche continued to ob&s;erve it, till the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fla&s;hes, lighting up the glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the whole horizon, warned her to retire from the window&punc; and &s;he joined the Abbe&s;s, who having exhau&s;ted all her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of conver&s;ation with the Counte&s;s, had now lei&s;ure to notice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>But their di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by tremenduous peal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thunder; and the bell of the mona&s;tery &s;oon after ringing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ummoned the inhabitants to prayer. As Blanche pa&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> windows &s;he gave another look to the ocean, where, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|mentary fla&s;h, that illumined the va&s;t body of the waters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tingui&s;hed the ve&s;&s;el &s;he had ob&s;erved before, amid&s;t a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

foam, breaking the billows, the ma&s;ts now bowing to the waves, and then ri&s;ing high in air.</P>
<P>She &s;ighed fervently as &s;he gazed, and then followed the La|dy Abbe&s;s and the Counte&s;s to the chapel. Meanwhile, &s;ome of the Count's &s;ervants, having gone by land to the chateau for carriages, returned &s;oon after ve&s;pers had concluded, when, the &s;torm being &s;omewhat abated, the Count and his family return|ed home. Blanche was &s;urpri&s;ed to di&s;cover how much the windings of the &s;hore had deceived her, concerning the di&s;tance of the chateau from the mona&s;tery, who&s;e ve&s;per bell &s;he had heard, on the preceding evening, from the windows of the we&s;t &s;aloon, and who&s;e towers &s;he would al&s;o have &s;een from thence, had not twilight veiled them.</P>
<P>On their arrival at the chateau, the Counte&s;s affecting more fatigue than &s;he really felt, withdrew to her apartment, and the Count, with his daughter and Henri, went to the &s;upper room, where they had not been long, when they heard, in a pau&s;e of the gu&s;t, a firing of guns, which the Count under&s;tanding to be &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s from &s;ome ve&s;&s;el in the &s;torm, went to a win|dow that opened towards the Mediterranean, to ob&s;erve further; but the &s;ea was now involved in utter darkne&s;s, and the loud howlings of the tempe&s;t had again overcome every other &s;ound. Blanche, remembering the bark, which &s;he had before &s;een, now joined her father, with trembling anxiety. In a few moments, the report of guns was again borne along the wind, and as &s;uddenly wafted away; a tremendous bur&s;t of thunder followed, and, in the fla&s;h, that had preceded it, and which &s;eemed to quiver over the whole &s;urface of the waters, a ve&s;&s;el was di&s;covered, to&s;&s;ing amid&s;t the white foam of the waves at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore. Impenetrable darkne&s;s again involved the &s;cene, but &s;oon a &s;econd fla&s;h &s;hewed the bark with one &s;ail unfurled, driving towards the coa&s;t. Blanche hung upon her father's arm, with looks full of the agony of united terror and pity, which were unnece&s;&s;ary to awaken the heart of the Count, who gazed upon the &s;ea with a piteous expre&s;&s;ion, and, perceiving that no boat could live in the &s;torm, forbore to &s;end one; but he gave orders to his people to carry torches out upon the cliffs, hoping they might prove a kind of beacon to the ve&s;&s;el, or, at lea&s;t, warn the crew of the rocks they were approaching. While Henri went out to direct on what part of the cliffs the lights &s;hould appear, Blanche remained, with her father at the window, catching every now and then, as the lightnings fla&s;hed, a glimp&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el; and &s;he &s;oon &s;aw, with reviving hope, the torches flaming on the

blackne&s;s of night, and, as they waved over the cliffs, ca&s;ting a red gleam on the ga&s;ping billows. When the firing of gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> was repeated, the torches were to&s;&s;ed high in the air, as if an|&s;wering the &s;ignal, and the firing was then redoubled; but, though the wind bore the &s;ound away, &s;he fancied, as the light|nings glanced, that the ve&s;&s;el was much nearer the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The Count's &s;ervants were now &s;een, running to and fro, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the rocks; &s;ome venturing almo&s;t to the point of the crags, and bending over, held out their torches fa&s;tened to long poles&punc; while others, who&s;e &s;teps could be traced only by the cour&s;e of the lights, de&s;cended the &s;teep and dangerous path, that wound to the margin of the &s;ea, and with loud halloos hailed the mar|iners, who&s;e &s;hrill whi&s;tle, and then feeble voices, were heard at intervals, mingling with the &s;torm. Sudden &s;houts from the people on the rocks increa&s;ed the anxiety of Blanche to an al|mo&s;t intolerable degree: but her &s;u&s;pen&s;e, concerning the fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the mariners, was &s;oon over, when Henri, running breathle&s;s into the room, told that the ve&s;&s;el was anchored in the bay be|low, but in &s;o &s;hattered a condition, that it was feared &s;he would part before the crew could di&s;embark. The Count immediate|ly gave orders for his own boats to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing them to &s;hore, and that &s;uch of the&s;e unfortunate &s;trangers as could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be accommodated in the adjacent hamlet &s;hould be entertained at the chateau. Among the latter, were Emily St. Aubert, Mon|&s;ieur Du Pont, Ludovico and Annette, who, having embarked at Leghorn and reached Mar&s;eilles, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thence cro&s;&s;ing the Gulph of Lyons, when this &s;torm overtook them.

<P>In Mon&s;ieur Du Pont the Count di&s;covered an old acquaint|ance, and much joy and congratulation pa&s;&s;ed between them, after which Emily was introduced by name to the Count's fam|ily, who&s;e ho&s;pitable benevolence di&s;&s;ipated the little embarra&s;&s;|ment, which her &s;ituation had occa&s;ioned her, and the part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> were &s;oon &s;eated at the &s;upper table. The unaffected kindne&s;s of Blanche and the lively joy &s;he expre&s;&s;ed on the e&s;cape of the &s;trangers, for whom her pity had been &s;o much intere&s;ted, grad|ually revived Emily's languid &s;pirits; and Du Pont, relieved from his terrors for her and for him&s;elf, felt the full contra&s;t, be|tween his late &s;ituation on a dark and tremendous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>Annette, meanwhile, in the &s;ervants' hall, was telling of all the dangers &s;he had encountered, and congratulating her&s;elf &s;o heartily upon her own and Ludovico's e&s;cape, and on her pre|&s;ent comforts, that &s;he often made all that part of the chateau ring with merriment and laughter. Ludovico's &s;pirits were as gay as her own, but he had di&s;cretion enough to re&s;train them, and tried to check hers, though in vain, till her laughter, at length, a&s;cended to <HI>my lady's</HI> chamber, who &s;ent to inquire what occa&s;ioned &s;o much uproar in the chateau, and to command &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew early to &s;eek the repo&s;e &s;he &s;o much requir|ed, but her pillow was long a &s;leeple&s;s one. On this her return to her native country, many intere&s;ting remembrances were awakened; all the events and &s;ufferings &s;he had experienced, &s;ince &s;he quitted it, came in long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to her fancy, and were cha&s;ed only by the image of Valancourt, with whom to believe her&s;elf once more in the &s;ame land, after they had been &s;o long, and &s;o di&s;tantly &s;eparated, gave her emotions of inde|&s;cribable joy, but which afterward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> yielded to anxiety and ap|prehen&s;ion, when &s;he con&s;idered the long period, that had elap&s;|ed, &s;ince any letter had pa&s;&s;ed between them, and how much might have happened in this interval to affect her future peace.

<P>THE Lady Blanche was &s;o much intere&s;ted for Emily, that, upon hearing &s;he was going to re&s;ide in the neighbouring con|vent, &s;he reque&s;ted the Count would invite her to lengthen her &s;tay at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the youthful &s;implicity, with which his daughter yielded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> impre&s;&s;ions; and, though he cho&s;e to warn her of their danger, he &s;ilently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the benevolence, that could thus readily expand in confidence to a &s;tranger. He had ob&s;erved Emily, with attention, on the preceding, evening and was as much plea&s;ed with her, as it was po&s;&s;ible he could be with any per&s;on, on &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance. The mention, made of her by Mon&s;. Du Pont, had al&s;o given him a favourable im|pre&s;&s;ion of Emily; but, extremely cautious as to tho&s;e, whom he introduced to the intimacy of his daughter, he determined, on hearing that the former was no &s;tranger at the convent of St. Claire, to vi&s;it the Abbe&s;s, and, if her account corre&s;ponded with his wi&s;h, to invite Emily to pa&s;s &s;ometime at the chateau. On this &s;ubject, he was influenced by a con&s;ideration of the Lady Blanche's welfare, &s;till more than by either a wi&s;h to oblige her, or to befriend the orphan Emily, for whom, however, he felt con&s;iderably intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>On the following morning, Emily was too much fatigued to appear; but Mon&s;. Du Pont was at the breakfa&s;t table, when the Count entered the room, who pre&s;&s;ed him as his former ac|quaintance, and the &s;on of a very old friend, to prolong his &s;tay at the chateau; an invitation, which Du Pont willingly accepted, &s;ince it would allow him to be near Emily: and, though he was not con&s;cious of encouraging a hope that &s;he would ever re|turn his affection, he had not fortitude enough to attempt, at pre&s;ent, to overcome it.</P>
<P>Emily, when &s;he was &s;omewhat recovered, wandered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her new friend over the grounds belonging to the chateau, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much delighted with the &s;urrounding views, as Blanche, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

benevolence of her heart, had wi&s;hed; from thence &s;he per|ceived, beyond <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e woods, the towers of the mona&s;tery, and re|marked, that it was to this convent &s;he de&s;igned to go.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Blanche with &s;urpri&s;e, "I am but ju&s;t relea&s;ed from a convent, and would you go into one? If you could know what plea&s;ure I feel in wandering here, at liberty,&mdash;and in &s;eeing the &s;ky and the fields, and the woods all round me. I think you would not." Emily, &s;miling at the warmth, with which the Lady Blanche &s;poke, ob&s;erved, that &s;he did not mean to confine her&s;elf to a convent for life.</P>
<P>"No, you may not intend it now," &s;aid Blanche; but you do not know to what the nuns may per&s;uade you to con&s;ent: I know how kind they will appear, and how happy, for I have &s;een too much of their art."</P>
<P>When they returned to the chateau, Lady Blanche <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emily to her favourite turret, and from thence they rambled through the ancient chambers, which Blanche had vi&s;ited before. Emily was amu&s;ed by ob&s;erving the &s;tructure of the&s;e apart|ments, and the fa&s;hion of their old but &s;till magnificent furni|ture, and by comparing them with tho&s;e of the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, which were yet more antique and grote&s;que. She was al&s;o intere&s;ted by Dorothee the hou&s;e keeper, who attended them, who&s;e appearance was almo&s;t as antique as the objects around her, and who &s;eemed no le&s;s intere&s;ted by Emily, on whom &s;he frequently gazed with &s;o much deep attention, as &s;carcely to hear what was &s;aid to her.</P>
<P>While Emily looked from one of the ca&s;ements, &s;he perceived, with &s;urpri&s;e, &s;ome objects, that were familiar to her memory;&mdash;the fields and woods, with the gleaming brook, which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed with La Voi&s;in, one evening, &s;oon after the death of Mon&s;ieur St. Aubert, in her way from the mona&s;tery to her cottage; and &s;he now knew this to be the chateau, which he had then avoided, and concerning which he had dropped &s;ome remarkable hints.</P>
<P>Shocked by this di&s;covery, yet &s;carcely knowing why, &s;he mu&s;ed for &s;ometime in &s;ilence, and remembered the emotion, which her father had betrayed on finding him&s;elf &s;o near this man&s;ion, and &s;ome other circum&s;tances of his conduct, that now greatly intere&s;ted her. The mu&s;ic, too, which &s;he had formerly heard, and, re&s;pecting which La Voi&s;in had given &s;uch an odd account, occurred to her, and, de&s;irous of knowing more con|cerning it, &s;he a&s;ked Dorothee whether it returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> midnight as u&s;ual, and whether the mu&s;ician had yet been di&s;covered.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="029378_0253_0FE085DC9B71E4E8">
"Yes, ma'am&s;elle," replied Dorothee, "That mu&s;ic is &s;till heard, but the mu&s;ician has never been found out, nor ever will, I believe; though there are &s;ome people who can gue&s;s."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid Emily, "then why do they not pur&s;ue the inquiry?"</P>
<P>"Ah, young lady! inquiry enough has been made&mdash;but who can pur&s;ue a &s;pirit?"</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled, and, remembering how lately &s;he had &s;uffered her&s;elf to be led away by &s;uper&s;tition, determined now to re&s;i&s;t its contagion; yet, in &s;pight of her efforts, &s;he felt awe mingle with her curio&s;ity, on this &s;ubject; and Blanche, who had hitherto li&s;tened in &s;ilence, now inquired what this mu&s;ic was, and how long it had been heard.</P>
<P>"Ever &s;ince the death of my lady, madam," replied Dorothee,</P>
<P>"Why the place is not haunted, &s;urely?" &s;aid Blanche, be|tween je&s;ting and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I have heard that mu&s;ic almo&s;t ever &s;ince my dear lady died," continued Dorothee, "and never before then. But that is nothing to &s;ome things I could tell of."</P>
<P>"Do, pray, tell them, then," &s;aid Lady Blanche, now more in earne&s;t than in je&s;t. "I am much intere&s;ted, for I have heard &s;i&s;ter Henriette, and &s;i&s;ter Sophie, in the convent, tell of &s;uch &s;trange appearances, which they them&s;elves had witne&s;&s;ed!"</P>
<P>"You never heard, my lady, I &s;uppo&s;e, what made us leave the chateau, and go and live in a cottage," &s;aid Dorothee. "Never!" replied Blanche with impatience.</P>
<P>"Nor the rea&s;on, that my lord, the Marquis"&mdash;Dorothee checked her&s;elf, he&s;itated, and then endeavoured to change the topic; but the curio&s;ity of Blanche was too much awakened to &s;uffer the &s;ubject thus ea&s;ily to e&s;cape her, and &s;he pre&s;&s;ed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> old hou&s;e keeper to proceed with her account, upon whom, how|ever, no entreaties could prevail; and it was evident, that &s;he was alarmed for the imprudence, into which &s;he had already betrayed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I perceive," &s;aid Emily, &s;miling, "that all old man&s;ions are haunted; I am lately come from a place of wonders; but un|luckily, &s;ince I left it, I have heard almo&s;t all of them explained."</P>
<P>Blanche was &s;ilent; Dorothee looked grave, and &s;ighed; and Emily felt her&s;elf &s;till inclined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> believe more of the wonderful than &s;he cho&s;e to acknowledge. Ju&s;t the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;he remembered the &s;pectacle &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed in a chamber of Udolpho, and, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> odd kind of coincidence, the alarming words, that had acciden|tally met her eye in the MS. papers, which &s;he had de&s;troyed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> obedience to the command of her father; and &s;he &s;huddered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="53" REF="029378_0253_0FE085DC9B71E4E8">
the meaning they &s;eemed to impart, almo&s;t as much as at the hor|rible appearance di&s;clo&s;ed by the black veil.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, unable to prevail with Doro|thee to explain the &s;ubject of her late hints, had de&s;ired, on reach|ing the door, that terminated the gallery, and which &s;he found fa&s;tened on the preceding day, to &s;ee the &s;uite of rooms beyond. "Dear young lady," &s;aid the hou&s;ekeeper, "I have told you my rea&s;on for not opening them; I have never &s;een them, &s;ince my dear lady died; and it would go hard with me to &s;ee them now. Pray, madam, do not a&s;k me again."</P>
<P>"Certainly I will not," replied Blanche, "if that is really your objection."</P>
<P>"Alas! it is," &s;aid the old woman, "we all loved her well, and I &s;hall always grieve for her. Time runs round! it is now many years &s;ince &s;he died; but I remember every thing, that happened then, as if it was but ye&s;terday. Many things, that have pa&s;&s;ed of late years, are gone quite from my memory, while, tho&s;e &s;o long ago, I can &s;ee as if in a gla&s;s." She pau&s;ed, but af|terwards, as they walked up the gallery, added of Emily, "This young lady &s;ometimes brings the late Marchione&s;s to my mind; I can remember, when &s;he looked ju&s;t as blooming, and very like her, when &s;he &s;miles. Poor lady! how gay &s;he was, when &s;he fir&s;t came to the chateau!"</P>
<P>"And was &s;he not gay afterwards?" &s;aid Blanche.</P>
<P>Dorothee &s;hook her head; and Emily ob&s;erved her, with eyes &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of the intere&s;t &s;he now felt. "Let us &s;it down in this window," &s;aid the Lady Blanche, on reaching the oppo&s;ite end of the gallery: "and pray, Dorothee, if it is not painful to you, tell us &s;omething more about the Marchione&s;s. I &s;hould like to look into the gla&s;s you &s;poke of ju&s;t now, and &s;ee a few of the circum&s;tances, which you &s;ay often pa&s;s over it."</P>
<P>"No, my lady," replied Dorothee; "if you knew as much as I do, you would not, for you would find there a di&s;mal train of them; I often wi&s;h I could &s;hut them out, but they will ri&s;e to my mind. I &s;ee my dear lady on her death bed,&mdash;her very look,&mdash;and remember all &s;he &s;aid&mdash;it was a terrible &s;cene!"</P>
<P>"Why was it &s;o terrible?" &s;aid Emily with emotion.</P>
<P>"Ah, dear young lady! is not death always terrible?" repli|ed Dorothee.</P>
<P>To &s;ome further inquiries of Blanche Dorothee was &s;ilent; and Emily, ob&s;erving the tears in her eye, forbore to urge the &s;ub|ject, and endeavoured to withdraw the attention of her young friend to &s;ome object in the gardens, where the Count, with the
<PB N="54" REF="029378_0254_0FE085E236A36D40">
Counte&s;s and Mon&s;ieur Du Pont, appearing, they went down to join them.</P>
<P>When he perceived Emily, he advanced to meet her, and pre|&s;ented her to the Counte&s;s, in a manner &s;o benign, that it recall|ed mo&s;t powerfully to her mind the idea of her late father, and &s;he felt more gratitude to him, than embarra&s;&s;ment towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Counte&s;s, who, however, received her with one of tho&s;e fa&s;cinat|ing &s;miles, which her caprice &s;ometimes allowed her to a&s;&s;ume, and which were now the re&s;ult of a conver&s;ation the Count had held with her concerning Emily. Whatever this might be, or whatever had pa&s;&s;ed in his conver&s;ation with the lady Abbe&s;s, whom he had ju&s;t vi&s;ited, e&s;teem and kindne&s;s were &s;trongly ap|parent in his manner, when he addre&s;&s;ed Emily, who experienced that &s;weet emotion, which ari&s;es from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the approbation of the good; for to the Count's worth &s;he had been inclined to yield her confidence almo&s;t from the fir&s;t moment, in which &s;he had &s;een him.</P>
<P>Before &s;he could fini&s;h her acknowledgments for the ho&s;pitali|ty &s;he had received, and mention her de&s;ign of going immediately to the convent, &s;he was interrupted by an invitation to lengthen her &s;tay at the chateau, which was pre&s;&s;ed by the Count and Counte&s;s, with an appearance of &s;uch friendly &s;incerity, that, though &s;he much wi&s;hed to &s;ee her old friends at the mona&s;tery, and to &s;igh, once more, over her father's grave, &s;he con&s;ented to remain a few days at the chateau.</P>
<P>To the Abbe&s;s, however, &s;he immediately wrote, mentioning her arrival in Languedoc and her wi&s;h to be received into the convent as a boarder; &s;he al&s;o &s;ent letters to Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel and to Valancourt, whom &s;he merely informed of her arrival i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> France; and as &s;he knew not where the latter might be &s;tation|ed, &s;he directed her letter to his brother's &s;eat in Ga&s;cony.</P>
<P>In the evening, Lady Blanche and Mon&s;. Du Pont walked with Emily to the cottage of La Voi&s;in, which &s;he had now a melancholy plea&s;ure in approaching, for time had &s;oftened her grief for the lo&s;s of St. Aubert, though it could not annihilate it, and &s;he felt a &s;oothing &s;adne&s;s in indulging the recollections, which this &s;cene recalled. La Voi&s;in was &s;till living, and &s;eem|ed to enjoy, as much as formerly, the tranquil evening of a blamele&s;s life. He was &s;itting at the door of his cottage, watch|ing &s;ome of his grand children, playing on the gra&s;s before him, and now and then, with a laugh, or a commendation, encourag|ing their &s;ports. He immediately recollected Emily whom he was much plea&s;ed to &s;ee, and &s;he was as rejoiced to hear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had not lo&s;t one of his family, &s;ince her departure.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="029378_0254_0FE085E236A36D40">
"Yes, ma'am&s;elle" &s;aid the old man, "we all live merrily to|gether &s;till, thank God! and I believe there is not a happier family to be found in Languedoc, than ours."</P>
<P>Emily did not tru&s;t her&s;elf in the chamber, where St. Aubert died; and after half an hour's conver&s;ation with La Voi&s;in and his family, &s;he left the cottage.</P>
<P>During the&s;e the fir&s;t days of her &s;tay at Chateau-le-Blanc, &s;he was often affected, by ob&s;erving the deep, but &s;ilent melan|choly, which at times &s;tole over Du Pont; and Emily, pitying the &s;elf delu&s;ion, which di&s;armed him of the will to depart, de|termined to withdraw her&s;elf as &s;oon as the re&s;pect &s;he owed the Count and Counte&s;s de Ville&s;ort would permit. The dejection of his friend &s;oon alarmed the anxiety of the Count, to whom Du Pont, at length, confided the &s;ecret of his hopele&s;s affection, which, however, the former could only commi&s;erate, though he &s;ecretly determined to befriend his &s;uit, if an opportunity of do|ing &s;o &s;hould ever occur. Con&s;idering the dangerous &s;ituation of Du Pont, he but feebly oppo&s;ed his intention of leaving Cha|teau-le-Blanc, on the following day, but drew from him a pro|mi&s;e of a longer vi&s;it, when he could return with &s;afety to his peace. Emily her&s;elf, though &s;he could not encourage his af|fection, e&s;teemed him both for the many virtues he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and for the &s;ervices &s;he had received from him; and it was not without tender emotions of gratitude and pity, that &s;he now &s;aw him depart for his family &s;eat in Ga&s;cony; while he took leave of her with a countenance &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of love and grief, as to intere&s;t the Count more warmly in his cau&s;e than before.</P>
<P>In a few days, Emily al&s;o left the chateau, but not before the Count and Counte&s;s had received her promi&s;e to repeat her vi&s;it very &s;oon; and &s;he was welcomed by the Abbe&s;s, with the &s;ame maternal kindne&s;s &s;he had formerly experienced, and by the nuns, with much expre&s;&s;ion of regard. The well known &s;cenes of the convent occa&s;ioned her many melancholy recollections, but with the&s;e were mingled others, that in&s;pired gratitude for hav|ing e&s;caped the various dangers, that had pur&s;ued her, &s;ince &s;he quitted it, and for the good, which &s;he yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and, though &s;he once more wept, over her father's grave, with tears of tender affection, her grief was &s;oftened from its former acutene&s;s.</P>
<P>Sometime after her return to the mona&s;tery, &s;he received a let|ter from her uncle, Mon&s;. Que&s;nel, in an&s;wer to information that &s;he had arrived in France, and to her inquiries, concerning &s;uch of her affairs as he had undertaken to conduct during her ab&s;ence, e&s;pecially as to the period for which La Vallee had been let,
<PB N="56" REF="029378_0255_0FE085F204881860">
whither it was her wi&s;h to return, if it &s;hould appear, that her in|come would permit her to do &s;o. The reply of Mon&s;. Que&s;nel was cold and formal, as &s;he expected, expre&s;&s;ing neither concern for the evils &s;he &s;uffered, nor plea&s;ure, that &s;he was now removed from them; nor did he allow the opportunity to pa&s;s, of reprov|ing her for her rejection of Count Morano, whom he affected &s;till to believe a man of honour and fortune; nor of vehemently de|claiming again&s;t Montoni, to whom he had always, till now, felt him&s;elf to be inferior. On Emily's pecuniary concerns, he was not very explicit; he informed her, however, that the term, for which La Vallee had been engaged, was nearly expired; but, without inviting her to his own hou&s;e, added, that her circum|&s;tances would by no means a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">w her to re&s;ide there, and earne&s;tly advi&s;ed her to remain, for the pre&s;ent, in the convent of St. Claire.</P>
<P>To her inquiries, re&s;pecting poor old There&s;a, her late fa|ther's &s;ervant, he gave no an&s;wer. In the po&s;t&s;cript to his let|ter, Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel mentioned M. Motteville, in who&s;e hands the late St. Aubert had placed the chief of his per&s;onal proper|ty, as being likely to arrange his affairs nearly to the &s;atisfaction of his creditors, and that Emily would recover much more of her fortune, than &s;he had formerly rea&s;on to expect. The letter al|&s;o inclo&s;ed to Emily an order upon a merchant at Narbonne, for a &s;mall &s;um of money.</P>
<P>The tranquillity of the mona&s;tery, and the liberty &s;he was &s;uf|fered to enjoy, in wandering among the woods and &s;hores of this delightful province, gradually re&s;tored her &s;pirits to their natu|ral tone, except that anxiety would &s;ometimes intrude, concern|ing Valancourt, as the time approached, when it was po&s;&s;ible that &s;he might receive a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> an&s;wer to her letter.</P>

<P>THE Lady Blanche, meanwhile, who was left much alone, became impatient for the company of her new friend, whom &s;he wi&s;hed to ob&s;erve &s;haring in the delight &s;he received from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> beautiful &s;cenery around. She had now no per&s;on, to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="57" REF="029378_0255_0FE085F204881860">
could expre&s;s her admiration and communicate her plea&s;ures, no eye, that &s;parkled to her &s;mile, or countenance that reflected her happine&s;s, and &s;he became &s;piritle&s;s and pen&s;ive. The Count, ob&s;erving her di&s;&s;atisfaction, readily yielded to her entreaties, and reminded Emily of her promi&s;ed vi&s;it; but the &s;ilence of Valancourt, which was now prolonged far beyond the period, when a letter might have arrived from E&s;tuviere, oppre&s;&s;ed Emi|ly with &s;evere anxiety, and rendering her aver&s;e to &s;ociety, &s;he would willingly have deferred her acceptance of this invitation, till her &s;pirits &s;hould be relieved. The Count and his family, however, pre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee her; and, as the circum&s;tances, that prompted her wi&s;h for &s;olitude, could not be explained, there was an appearance of caprice in her refu&s;al, which &s;he could not per&s;evere in, without offending the friends, who&s;e e&s;teem &s;he val|ued. At length, therefore, &s;he returned upon a &s;econd vi&s;it to Chateau-le-Blanc. Here the friendly manner of Count De Vil|lefort encouraged Emily to mention to him her &s;ituation, re|&s;pecting the e&s;tates of her late aunt, and to con&s;ult him on the means of recovering them. He had little doubt, that the law would decide in her favour, and, advi&s;ing her to apply to it, offered fir&s;t to write to an advocate at Avignon, on who&s;e opin|ion he thought he could rely. His kindne&s;s was gratefully ac|cepted by Emily, who, &s;oothed by the courte&s;y &s;he daily experi|enced, would have been once more happy, could &s;he have been a&s;&s;ured of Valancourt's welfare and unaltered affection. She had now been above a week at the chateau, without receiving in|telligence of him, and though &s;he knew, that if he was ab&s;ent from his brother's re&s;idence, it was &s;carcely probable her letter had yet reached him, &s;he could not forbear to admit doubts and fears, that de&s;troyed her peace. Again &s;he would con&s;ider of all that might have happened in the long period, &s;ince her fir&s;t &s;e|clu&s;ion at Udolpho, and her mind was &s;ometimes &s;o overwhelm|ed with an apprehen&s;ion, that Valancourt was no more, or that he lived no longer for her, that the company even of Blanche be|came intolerably oppre&s;&s;ive, and &s;he would &s;it alone in her apart|ment for hours together, when the engagements of the family al|lowed her to do &s;o, without incivility.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e &s;olitary hours, &s;he unlocked a little box, which contained &s;ome letters of Valancourt, with &s;ome drawings &s;he had &s;ketched during her &s;tay in Tu&s;cany, the latter which were no longer intere&s;ting to her; but, in the letters, &s;he now with melancholy indulgence, meant to retrace the tenderne&s;s, that had
<PB N="58" REF="029378_0256_0FE085F6A6100C90">
&s;o often &s;oothed her, and rendered her, for a moment in&s;en&s;ible of the di&s;tance, which &s;eparated her from the writer. But their effect was now changed; the affection they expre&s;&s;ed appealed &s;o forcibly to her heart, when &s;he con&s;idered that it had, perhaps, yielded to the powers of time and ab&s;ence, and even the view of the hand writing recalled &s;o many painful recollections, that &s;he found her&s;elf unable to go through the fir&s;t &s;he had opened, and &s;at mu&s;ing, with her cheek re&s;ting on her arm, and tears &s;tealing from her eyes, when old Dorothee entered the room to inform her, that dinner would be ready, an hour before the u&s;ual time. Emily &s;tarted on perceiving her, and ha&s;tily put up the papers, but not before Dorothee had ob&s;erved both her agitation and her tears.</P>
<P>"Ah, ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid &s;he, "you, who are &s;o young,&mdash;have you rea&s;on for &s;orrow?"</P>
<P>Emily tried to &s;mile, but was unable to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"Alas! dear young lady, when you come to my age, you will not weep at trifles; and &s;urely you have nothing &s;erious to grieve you."</P>
<P>"No, Dorothee, nothing of any con&s;equence," replied Emily, Dorothee, now &s;tooping to pick up &s;omething, that had dropped from among the papers, &s;uddenly exclaimed, "Holy Mary! what is it I &s;ee?" and then, trembling, &s;at down in a chair, that &s;tood by the table.</P>
<P>"What is it you do &s;ee?" &s;aid Emily, alarmed by her man|ner, and looking round the room.</P>
<P>"It is her&s;elf," &s;aid Dorothee, "her very &s;elf! ju&s;t as &s;he looked a little before &s;he died!"</P>
<P>Emily, &s;till more alarmed, began now to fear, that Dorothee was &s;eized with &s;udden phren&s;y, but entreated her to explain her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"That picture?" &s;aid &s;he, "where did you find it, lady? it is my ble&s;&s;ed mi&s;tre&s;s her&s;elf!"</P>
<P>She laid on the table the miniature, which Emily had long ago found among the papers her father had enjoined her to de&s;troy, and over which &s;he had once &s;een him &s;hed &s;uch tender and af|fecting tears; and, recollecting all the various circum&s;tances of his conduct, that had long perplexed her, her emotions increa&s;ed to an exce&s;s, which deprived her of all power to a&s;k the que&s;tions &s;he trembled to have an&s;wered, and &s;he could only inquire, whe|ther Dorothee was certain the picture re&s;embled the late Mar|chione&s;s.</P>
<P>"O, ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid &s;he, "how came it to &s;trike me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the in&s;tant I &s;aw it, if it was not my lady's likene&s;s? Ah
<PB N="59" REF="029378_0256_0FE085F6A6100C90">
added &s;he, taking up the miniature, "the&s;e are her own blue eyes&mdash;looking &s;o &s;weet and &s;o mild; and there is her very look, &s;uch as I have often &s;een it, when &s;he had &s;at thinking for a long while, and then, the tears would often &s;teal down her cheeks&mdash;but &s;he never would complain! It was that look &s;o meek, as it were, and re&s;igned, that u&s;ed to break my heart and make me love her &s;o!"</P>
<P>"Dorothee!" &s;aid Emily &s;olemnly, "I am intere&s;ted in the cau&s;e of that grief, more &s;o, perhaps, than you may imagine; and I entreat, that you will no longer refu&s;e to indulge my cu|rio&s;ity;&mdash;it is not a common one."</P>
<P>As Emily &s;aid this, &s;he remembered the papers, with which the picture had been found, and had &s;carcely a doubt, that they had concerned the Marchione&s;s do Villeroi; but with this &s;up|po&s;ition came a &s;cruple, whether &s;he ought to inquire further on a &s;ubject, which might prove to be the &s;ame, that her father had &s;o carefully endeavoured to conceal. Her curio&s;ity, concerning the Marchione&s;s, powerful as it was, it is probable &s;he would now have re&s;i&s;ted, as &s;he had formerly done, on unwarily ob&s;erving the few terrible words in the papers, which had never &s;ince been era&s;ed from her memory, had &s;he been certain that the hi&s;tory of that lady was the &s;ubject of tho&s;e papers, or that &s;uch &s;imple particulars only as it was probable Dorothee could relate were included in her father's command. What was known to her could be no &s;ecret to many other per&s;ons; and, &s;ince it ap|peared very unlikely, that St. Aubert &s;hould attempt to conceal what Emily might learn by ordinary means, &s;he at length con|cluded, that if the papers had related to the &s;tory of the Mar|chione&s;s, it was not tho&s;e circum&s;tances of it, which Dorothee could di&s;clo&s;e, that he had thought &s;ufficiently important to wi&s;h to have concealed. She, therefore, no longer he&s;itated to make the inquiries, that might lead to the gratification of her curio|&s;ity.</P>
<P>"Ah, ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid Dorothee, "it is a &s;ad &s;tory, and cannot be told now: but what am I &s;aying? I never will tell it. Many years have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince it happened; and I never loved to talk of the Marchione&s;s to any body, but my hu&s;band. He lived in the family, at that time, as well as my&s;elf, and he knew many particulars from me, which nobody el&s;e did; for I was about the per&s;on of my lady in her la&s;t illne&s;s, and &s;aw and heard as much, or more than my lord him&s;elf. Sweet &s;aint! how patient &s;he was! When &s;he died, I thought I could have died with her!"</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="029378_0257_0FE0860481B368D8">
"Dorothee," &s;aid Emily, interrupting her, "what you &s;hall tell, you may depend upon it, &s;hall never be di&s;clo&s;ed by me. I have, I repeat it, particular rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to be informed on this &s;ubject, and am willing to bind my&s;elf, in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn manner, never to mention what you &s;hall wi&s;h me to con|ceal."</P>
<P>Dorothee &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at the earne&s;tne&s;s of Emily's man|ner, and, after regarding her for &s;ome moments, in &s;ilence, &s;aid, "Young lady! that look of yours pleads for you&mdash;it is &s;o like my dear mi&s;tre&s;s's, that I can almo&s;t fancy I &s;ee her before me; if you were her daughter, you could not remind me of her more. But dinner will be ready&mdash;had you not better go down?"</P>
<P>"You will fir&s;t promi&s;e to grant my reque&s;t," &s;aid Emily, "and ought not you fir&s;t to tell me, ma'am&s;elle, how this picture fell into your hands, and the rea&s;ons, you &s;ay you have for curio&s;ity about my lady?"</P>
<P>"Why, no, Dorothee," replied Emily, recollecting her&s;elf, "I have al&s;o particular rea&s;ons for ob&s;erving &s;ilence, on the&s;e &s;ubjects, at lea&s;t, till I know further; and, remember, I do not promi&s;e ever to &s;peak upon them; therefore, do not let me in|duce you to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity, from an expectation, that I &s;hall gratify yours. What I may judge proper to conceal, does not concern my&s;elf alone, or I &s;hould have le&s;s &s;cruple in re|vealing it; let a confidence in my honour alone per&s;uade you to di&s;clo&s;e what I reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"Well, lady!" replied Dorothee, after a long pau&s;e, during which her eyes were fixed upon Emily, "you &s;eem &s;o much in|tere&s;ted,&mdash;and this picture and that face of yours make me think you have &s;ome rea&s;on to be &s;o,&mdash;that I will tru&s;t you&mdash;and tell &s;ome things, that I never told before to any body, but my hu&s;band, though there are people, who have &s;u&s;pected as much. I will tell you the particulars of my lady's death, too, and &s;ome of my own &s;u&s;picions; but you mu&s;t fir&s;t promi&s;e me by all the &s;aints"&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily, interrupting her, &s;olemnly promi&s;ed never to reveal what &s;hould be confided to her without Dorothee's con&s;ent.</P>
<P>"But there is the horn, ma'am&s;elle &s;ounding for dinner," &s;aid Dorothee; "I mu&s;t be gone."</P>
<P>"When &s;hall I &s;ee you again?" inquired Emily.</P>
<P>Dorothee mu&s;ed, and then replied, "Why, madam, it may make people curious, if it is known I am &s;o much in your a|partment, and that I &s;hould be &s;orry for; &s;o I will come when I am lea&s;t likely to be ob&s;erved. I have little lei&s;ure in the day,
<PB N="61" REF="029378_0257_0FE0860481B368D8">
and I &s;hall have a good deal to &s;ay; &s;o, if you plea&s;e, ma'am, I will come, when the family are all in bed."</P>
<P>"That will &s;uite me very well," replied Emily; "Remem|ber then to night"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Aye, that is well remembered," &s;aid Dorothee, "I fear I cannot come to night, madam, for there will be the dance of the vintage, and it will be late, before the &s;ervants go to re&s;t; for, when they once &s;et in to dance, they will keep it up, in the cool of the air, till morning; at lea&s;t, it u&s;ed to be &s;o in my time."</P>
<P>"Ah! is it the dance of the vintage?" &s;aid Emily, with a deep &s;igh, remembering, that it was on the evening of this fe&s;tival, in the preceding year, that St. Aubert and her&s;elf had arrived in the neighbourhood of Chateau-le-Blanc. She pau&s;ed a moment, overcome by the &s;udden recollection, and then, re|covering her&s;elf, added&mdash;"But this dance is in the open woods; you therefore will not be wanted, and can ea&s;ily come to me."</P>
<P>Dorothee replied, that &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to be pre&s;ent at the dance of the vintage, and &s;he did not wi&s;h to be ab&s;ent now; "but if I can get away, madam, I will," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Emily then ha&s;tened to the dining room, where the Count con|ducted him&s;elf with the courte&s;y, which is in&s;eparable from true dignity, and of which the Counte&s;s frequently practi&s;ed lit|tle, though her manner to Emily was an exception to her u&s;ual habit. But, if &s;he retained few of the ornamental virtues, &s;he cheri&s;hed other qualities, which &s;he &s;eemed to con&s;ider invalua|ble. She had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the grace of mode&s;ty, but then &s;he knew perfectly well how to manage the &s;tare of a&s;&s;urance; her manners had little of the tempered &s;weetne&s;s, which is nece&s;&s;ary to render the female character intere&s;ting, but &s;he could occa&s;ion|ally throw into them an affectation of &s;pirits, which &s;eemed to triumph over every per&s;on, who approached her. In the coun|try, however, &s;he generally affected an elegant languor, that per&s;uaded her almo&s;t to faint, when her favourite read to her a &s;tory of fictitious &s;orrow; but her countenance &s;uffered no change when living objects of di&s;tre&s;s &s;olicited her charity, and her heart beat with no tran&s;port to the thought of giving them in&s;tant relief;&mdash;&s;he was a &s;tranger to the highe&s;t luxury, of which, perhaps, the human mind can be &s;en&s;ible, for her ben|evolence had never yet called &s;miles upon the face of mi&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>In the evening, the Count, with all his family, except the Counte&s;s and Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, went to the woods to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the fe&s;tivity of the pea&s;ants. The &s;cene was in a glade, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the trees, opening, formed a circle round the turf they highly
<PB N="62" REF="029378_0258_0FE0860916B53798">
over&s;hadowed; between their branches, vines, loaded with ripe clu&s;ters, were hung in gay fe&s;toons; and, beneath, were tables, with fruit, wine, chee&s;e and other rural fare,&mdash;and &s;eats for the Count and his family. At a little di&s;tance, were benches for the elder pea&s;ants, few of whom, however, could forbear to join the jocund dance, which began &s;oon after &s;un&s;et, when &s;ev|eral of &s;ixty, tripped it with almo&s;t as much glee and airy light|ne&s;s, as tho&s;e of &s;ixteen.</P>
<P>The mu&s;icians, who &s;at carele&s;sly on the gra&s;s at the foot of a tree, &s;eemed in&s;pired by the &s;ound of their own in&s;truments, which were chiefly flutes and a kind of a long guitar. Behind &s;tood a boy, flouri&s;hing a tamborine, and dancing a &s;olo, except that, as he &s;ometimes gaily to&s;&s;ed the in&s;trument, he tripped among the other dancers, when his antic ge&s;tures called forth a broader laugh, and heightened the ru&s;tic &s;pirit of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The Count was highly delighted with the happine&s;s he wit|ne&s;&s;ed, to which his bounty had largely contributed, and the Lady Blanche joined the dance with a young gentleman of her father's party. Du Pont reque&s;ted Emily's hand, but her &s;pir|its were too much depre&s;&s;ed, to permit her to engage in the pre&s;ent fe&s;tivity, which called to her remembrance that of the preceding year, when St. Aubert was living, and of the melan|choly &s;cenes which had immediately followed it.</P>
<P>Overcome by the&s;e recollections, &s;he, at length left the &s;pot, and walked &s;lowly into the woods, where the &s;oftened mu&s;ic, floating at a di&s;tance, &s;oothed her melancholy mind. The moon threw a mellow light among the foliage; the air was balmy and cool, and Emily, lo&s;t in thought, &s;trolled on, with|out ob&s;erving whither, till &s;he perceived the &s;ounds &s;inking afar off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tillne&s;s round her, except that, &s;ometimes, the nightingale beguiled the &s;ilence with
<Q><L>Liquid notes, that clo&s;e the eye of day.</L></Q></P>
<P>At length, &s;he found her&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear the avenue, which, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, Michael had attempted to pa&s;s in &s;earch of a hou&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was &s;till nearly as wild and de&s;olate as it had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appeared; for the Count had been &s;o much engaged in directing other improvements, that he had neglected to give orders concerning this exten&s;ive approach, and the road was yet broken, and the trees overloaded with their own luxuriance.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;tood &s;urveying it, and remembering the emotions which &s;he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uffered there, &s;he &s;uddenly recollected the figure, that had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;een &s;tealing among the trees, and which
<PB N="63" REF="029378_0258_0FE0860916B53798">
had returned no an&s;wer to Michael's repeated calls; and &s;he experienced &s;omewhat of the fear, that had then a&s;&s;ailed her, for it did not appear improbable, that the&s;e deep woods were occa|&s;ionally the haunt of banditti. She, therefore, turned back, and was ha&s;tily pur&s;uing her way to the dancers, when &s;he heard &s;teps approaching from the avenue; and, being &s;till beyond the call of the pea&s;ants on the green, for &s;he could neither hear their voices, or their mu&s;ic, &s;he quickened her pace; but the per&s;ons following gained fa&s;t upon her, and, at length di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the voice of Henri, &s;he walked lei&s;urely, till he came up. He expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at meeting her &s;o far from the com|pany; and, on her &s;aying, that the plea&s;ant moonlight had be|guiled her to walk farther than &s;he intended, an exclamation bur&s;t from the lips of his companion, and &s;he thought &s;he heard Valancourt &s;peak! It was, indeed, he! and the meeting was &s;uch as may be imagined, between per&s;ons &s;o affectionate, and &s;o long &s;eparated as they had been.</P>
<P>In the joy of the&s;e moments, Emily forgot all her pa&s;t &s;uffer|ings, and Valancourt &s;eemed to have forgotten, that any per&s;on but Emily exi&s;ted; while Henri was a &s;ilent and a&s;toni&s;hed &s;pec|tator of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Valancourt a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions, concerning her&s;elf and Montoni, which there was now no time to an&s;wer; but &s;he learned that her letter had been forwarded to him, at Paris, which he had previou&s;ly quitted, and was returning to Ga&s;cony, whither the letter al&s;o returned, which, at length informed him of Emily's arrival, and on the receipt of which he had imme|diately &s;et out for Languedoc. On reaching the mona&s;tery, whence &s;he had dated her letter, he found, to his extreme di&s;|appointment, that the gates were already clo&s;ed for the night; and believing, that he &s;hould not &s;ee Emily, till the morrow, he was returning to his little inn, with the intention of writing to her, when he was overtaken by Henri, with whom he had been intimate at Paris, and was led to her, whom he was &s;e|cretly lamenting that he &s;hould not &s;ee, till the following day.</P>
<P>Emily, with Valancourt and Henri, now returned to the green, where the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tter pre&s;ented Valancourt to the Count, who, &s;he fancied, received him with le&s;s than his u&s;ual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, though it appeared, that they were not &s;trangers to each other. He was invited, however, to partake of the diver&s;ions of the evening; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had paid his re&s;pects to the Count, and while the dance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> continued their fe&s;tivity, he &s;eated him&s;elf by Emily, and conver&s;ed, without con&s;traint. The lights, which
<PB N="64" REF="029378_0259_0FE086176A7FD260">
were hung among the trees, under which they &s;at, allowed her a more perfect view of the countenance &s;he had &s;o frequently in ab&s;ence endeavoured to recollect, and &s;he perceived, with &s;ome regret, that it was not the &s;ame as when la&s;t &s;he &s;aw it. There was all its wonted intelligence and &s;ire; but it had lo&s;t much of the &s;implicity, and &s;omewhat of the open benevolence, that u&s;ed to characteri&s;e it. Still, however, it was an intere&s;ting counten|ance; but Emily thought &s;he perceived, at intervals, anxiety contract, and melancholy fix the features of Valancourt; &s;ome|times, too, he fell into a momentary mu&s;ing, and then appeared anxious to di&s;&s;ipate thought; while, at others, as he fixed his eyes on Emily, a kind of &s;udden di&s;traction &s;eemed to cro&s;s his mind. In her he perceived the &s;ame goodne&s;s and beautiful &s;implicity, that had charmed him, on their fir&s;t acquaintance. The bloom of her countenance was &s;omewhat faded, but all its &s;weetne&s;s remained, and it was rendered more intere&s;ting, than ever, by the faint expre&s;&s;ion of melancholy, that &s;ometimes mingled with her &s;mile.</P>
<P>At his reque&s;t, &s;he related the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances, that had occured to her, &s;ince &s;he left France, and emotions of pi|ty and indignation alternately prevailed in his mind, when he heard how much &s;he had &s;uffered from the villany of Montoni. More than once, when &s;he was &s;peaking of his conduct, of which the guilt was rather &s;oftened, than exaggerated, by her repre|&s;entation, he &s;tarted from his &s;eat and walked away, apparently overcome as much by &s;elf accu&s;ation as by re&s;entment. Her &s;uf|ferings alone were mentioned in the few words, which he could addre&s;s to her, and he li&s;tened not to the account, which &s;he was careful to give as di&s;tinctly as po&s;&s;ible of the pre&s;ent lo&s;s of Ma|dame Montoni's e&s;tates, and of the little rea&s;on there was to ex|pect their re&s;toration. At length, Valancourt remained lo&s;t in thought, and then &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;e &s;eemed to overcome him, with angui&s;h. Again he abruptly left her. When he return|ed, &s;he perceived, that he had been weeping, and tenderly beg|ged, that he would compo&s;e him&s;elf. "My &s;ufferings are all pa&s;&s;ed now," &s;aid &s;he, "for I have e&s;caped from the tyranny of Montoni, and I &s;ee you well&mdash;let me al&s;o &s;ee you happy."</P>
<P>Valancourt was more agitated, than before. "I am unwor|thy of you, Emily," &s;aid he, "I am unworthy of you;"&mdash;words, by his manner of uttering which Emily was then more &s;hocked than by their import. She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on him a mournful and inquiring eye. "Do not look that on me," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> turn|ing away and pre&s;&s;ing her hand; "I cannot bear tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">."</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="029378_0259_0FE086176A7FD260">
"I would a&s;k," &s;aid Emily, in a gentle but agitated voice, "the meaning of your words; but I perceive, that the que&s;tion would di&s;tre&s;s you now. Let us talk on other &s;ubjects. To morrow, perhaps, you may be more compo&s;ed. Ob&s;erve tho&s;e moonlight woods, and the towers, which appear ob&s;curely in the per&s;pective. You u&s;ed to be a great admirer of land&s;cape, and I have heard you &s;ay, that the faculty of deriving con&s;olation, under misfortune, from the &s;ublime pro&s;pects, which neither op|pre&s;&s;ion, or poverty withhold from us, was the peculiar ble&s;&s;ing of the innocent." Valancourt was deeply affected. "Yes," replied he, "I had once a ta&s;te for innocent and elegant delights, I had once an uncorrupted heart." Then, checking him&s;elf, he added, "Do you remember our journey together in the Pyre|nees?"</P>
<P>"Can I forget it?" &s;aid Emily&mdash;"Would that I could!" he replied;&mdash;"that was the happie&s;t period of my life. I then loved with enthu&s;ia&s;m, whatever was truely great, or good." It was &s;ometime before Emily could repre&s;s her tears, and try to command her emotions. "If you wi&s;h to forget that journey," &s;aid &s;he, "it mu&s;t certainly be my wi&s;h to forget it al&s;o." She pau&s;ed, and then added, "You make me very unea&s;y; but this is not the time for further inquiry; yet, how can I bear to be|lieve, even for a moment, that you are le&s;s worthy of my e&s;teem than formerly? I have &s;till &s;ufficient confidence in your can|dour, to believe, that, when I &s;hall a&s;k for an explanation, you will give it me."&mdash;"Yes," &s;aid Valancourt, "yes, Emily: I have not, yet lo&s;t my candour: if I had, I could better have di&s;|gui&s;ed my emotions, on learning what were your &s;ufferings&mdash;your virtues,&mdash;while I&mdash;I&mdash;but I will &s;ay no more. I did not mean to have &s;aid even &s;o much&mdash;I have been &s;urpri&s;ed into the &s;elf-accu&s;ation. Tell me, Emily, that you will not forget that jour|ney&mdash;will not wi&s;h to forget it, and I will be calm. I would not lo&s;e the remembrance of it for the whole earth."</P>
<P>"How contradictory is this!" &s;aid Emily;&mdash;"but we may be overheard. My recollection of it &s;hall depend upon yours; I will endeavour to forget, or to recollect it, as you may do. Let us join the Count."&mdash;"Tell me, fir&s;t," &s;aid Valancourt, "that you forgive the unea&s;ine&s;s I have occa&s;ioned you, this evening, and that you will &s;till love me."&mdash;"I &s;incerely forgive you," replied Emily. "You be&s;t know whether I &s;hall con|tinue to love, you, for you know whether you de&s;erve my e&s;teem. At pre&s;ent, I will believe that you do. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay," added &s;he, ob&s;erving his dejection, "how much pain it would
<PB N="66" REF="029378_0260_0FE0861C0A7C20B8">
give me to believe otherwi&s;e.&mdash;The young lady who approaches is the Count's daughter."</P>
<P>Valancourt and Emily now joined the Lady Blanche; and the party, &s;oon after, &s;at down with the Count, his &s;on, and the Chevalier Du Pont, at a banquet, &s;pread under a gay awning, beneath the trees. At the table al&s;o were &s;eated &s;everal of the mo&s;t venerable of the Count's tenants, and it was a fe&s;tive repa&s;t to all but Valancourt and Emily. When the Count retired to the chateau, he did not invite Valancourt to accompany him, who, therefore, took leave of Emily, and retired to his &s;olitary inn for the night: meanwhile, &s;he &s;oon withdrew to her own apartment, where &s;he mu&s;ed, with deep anxiety and concern, on his behaviour, and on the Count's reception of him. Her atten|tion was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o wholly engaged, that &s;he forgot Dorothee and her appointment, till morning was far advanced, when, knowing that the good old woman would not come, &s;he retired, for a few hours to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the following day, when the Count had accidentally joined Emily in one of the walks, they talked of the fe&s;tival of the pre|ceding evening, and this led him to a mention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Valancourt. "That is a young man of talents," &s;aid he; "you were for|merly acquainted with him, I perceive." Emily &s;aid that &s;he was. "He was introduced to me at Paris," &s;aid the Count, "and I was much plea&s;ed with him, on our fir&s;t acquaintance." He pau&s;ed, and Emily trembled, between the de&s;ire of hearing more and the fear of &s;hewing the Count, that &s;he felt an intere&s;t on the &s;ubject. "May I a&s;k," &s;aid he, at length, "how long you have known Mon&s;ieur Valancourt?"&mdash;"Will you allow me to a&s;k your rea&s;on for the que&s;tion, &s;ir?" &s;aid &s;he; "and I will an&s;wer it immediately."&mdash;"Certainly," &s;aid the Count, "that is but ju&s;t. I will tell you my rea&s;on. I cannot but perceive that Mon&s;ieur Valancourt admires you; in that, however, there is nothing extraordinary; every per&s;on, who &s;ees you mu&s;t do the &s;ame. I am above u&s;ing common place compliments; I &s;peak with &s;incerity. What I fear, is, that he is a favoured admirer."&mdash;"Why do you fear it, &s;ir?" &s;aid Emily, endea|vouring to conceal her emotion.&mdash;"Becau&s;e," replied the Count, "I think him not worthy of your favour." Emily, greatly agi|tated, entreated further explanation. "I will give it," &s;aid he, "if you will believe, that nothing but a &s;trong intere&s;t in your welfare could induce me to hazard that a&s;&s;ertion."&mdash;"I mu&s;t believe &s;o, &s;ir," replied Emily.</P>
<P>"But let us re&s;t under the&s;e trees," &s;aid the Count, ob&s;erving the palene&s;s of her countenance; "here is a &s;eat&mdash;you are fa|tigued."
<PB N="67" REF="029378_0260_0FE0861C0A7C20B8">
They &s;at down, and the Count proceeded. "Many young ladies, circum&s;tanced as you are, would think my conduct, on this occa&s;ion, and on &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance, impertinent, in&s;tead of friendly; from what I have ob&s;erved of your temper and under&s;tanding, I do not fear &s;uch a return from you. Our acquaintance has been &s;hort, but long enough to make me e&s;|teem you, and feel a lively intere&s;t in your happine&s;s. You de|&s;erve to be very happy, and I tru&s;t that you will be &s;o." Emily &s;ighed &s;oftly, and bowed her thanks. The Count pau&s;ed again, "I am unplea&s;antly circum&s;tanced," &s;aid he, "but an opportunity of rendering you important &s;ervice &s;hall overcome inferior con&s;iderations. Will you inform me of the manner of your fir&s;t acquaintance with the Chevalier Valancourt, if the &s;ubject is not too painful?"</P>
<P>Emily briefly related the accident of their meeting in the pre|&s;ence of her father, and then &s;o earne&s;tly entreated the Count not to he&s;itate in declaring what he knew, that he perceived the vio|lent emotion, again&s;t which &s;he was contending, and, regarding her with a look of tender compa&s;&s;ion, con&s;idered how he might communicate his information with lea&s;t pain to his anxious auditor.</P>
<P>"The Chevalier and my &s;on," &s;aid he, "were introduced to each other, at the table of a brother officer, at who&s;e hou&s;e I al&s;o met him, and invited him to my own, whenever he &s;hould be di&s;|engaged. I did not then know, that he had formed an acquain|tance with a &s;et of men, a di&s;grace to their &s;pecies, who live by plunder and pa&s;s their lives in continual debauchery. I knew &s;everal of the Chevalier's family, re&s;ident at Paris, and con&s;idered them as &s;ufficient pledges for his introduction to my own. But you are ill; I will leave the &s;ubject."&mdash;"No, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, "I beg you will proceed; I am only di&s;tre&s;&s;ed."&mdash;"<HI>Only!"</HI> &s;aid the Count, with empha&s;is; "however, I will proceed. I &s;oon learned, that the&s;e, his a&s;&s;ociates, had drawn him into a cour&s;e of di&s;&s;ipation, from which he appeared to have neither the power, nor the inclination, to extricate him&s;elf. He lo&s;t large &s;ums at the gaming table; he became infatuated with play; and was ruined. I &s;poke tenderly of this to his friends, who a&s;&s;ured me, that they had remon&s;trated with him, till they were weary. I afterwards learned, that, in con&s;ideration of his talents for play, which were generally &s;ucce&s;sful, when unoppo&s;ed by the tricks of villany,&mdash;that, in con&s;ideration of the&s;e, the party had initiat|ed him into the &s;ecrets of their trade, and allotted him a &s;hare of their profits." "Impo&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid Emily &s;uddenly; "but&mdash;pardon me, &s;ir, I &s;carcely know what I &s;ay; allow for the
<PB N="68" REF="029378_0261_0FE086285A35F600">
di&s;tre&s;s of my mind. I mu&s;t, indeed, I mu&s;t believe, that you have not been truly informed. The Chevalier had, doubtle&s;s, enemies who mi&s;repre&s;ented him."&mdash;"I &s;hould be mo&s;t happy to believe &s;o," replied the Count, "but I cannot. Nothing &s;hort of conviction, and a regard for your happine&s;s could have urged me to repeat the&s;e unplea&s;ant reports."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;ilent. She recollected Valancourt's &s;ayings, on the preceding evening, which di&s;covered the pangs of &s;elf re|proach, and &s;eemed to confirm all that the Count had related. Yet &s;he had not fortitude enough to dare conviction. Her heart was overwhelmed with angui&s;h at the mere &s;u&s;picion of his guilt, and &s;he could not endure a belief of it. After a long &s;ilence, the Count &s;aid, "I perceive, and can allow for, your want of conviction. It is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould give &s;ome proof of what I have a&s;&s;erted; but this I cannot do, without &s;ubject|ing one, who is very dear to me, to danger."&mdash;"What is the danger you apprehend, &s;ir?" &s;aid Emily; "if I can prevent it, you may &s;afely confide in my honour."&mdash;"On your honour I am certain I can rely," &s;aid the Count; "but can I tru&s;t your fortitude? Do you think you can re&s;i&s;t the &s;olicitation of a favoured admirer, when he pleads, in affliction, for the name of one, who has robbed him of a ble&s;&s;ing?"&mdash;"I &s;hall not be ex|po&s;ed to &s;uch a temptation, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, with mode&s;t pride, "for I cannot favour one, whom I mu&s;t no longer e&s;teem. I, however, readily give my word." Tears, in the meantime, contradicted her fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion; and &s;he felt, that time and ef|fort only could eradicate an affection, which had been formed on virtuous e&s;teem, and cheri&s;hed by habit and difficulty.</P>
<P>"I will tru&s;t you then," &s;aid the Count, "for conviction i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nece&s;&s;ary to your peace, and cannot I perceive, be obtained, without this confidence. My &s;on has too often been an eye witne&s;s of the Chevalier's ill conduct; he was very near being drawn in by it; he was, indeed, drawn in to the commi&s;&s;ion of many follies, but I re&s;cued him from guilt and de&s;truction. Judge then, Mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert, whether a father who had nearly lo&s;t his only &s;on, by the example of the Chevalier, has not, from conviction, rea&s;on to warn tho&s;e, whom he e&s;teems, again&s;t tru&s;t|ing their happine&s;s in &s;uch hands. I have my&s;elf &s;een the Che|valier engaged in deep play with men, whom I almo&s;t &s;huddered to look upon. If you &s;till doubt, I will refer you to my &s;on."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t not doubt what you have your&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed," repli|ed Emily, &s;inking with grief, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or what you a&s;&s;ert. But the Chevalier has, perhaps, been drawn only into a tran&s;ient folly,
<PB N="69" REF="029378_0261_0FE086285A35F600">
which he may never repeat. If you had known the ju&s;tne&s;s of his former principles, you would allow for my pre&s;ent incredulity."</P>
<P>"Alas!" ob&s;erved the Count, "it is difficult to believe that which will make us wretched. But I will not &s;ooth you by flattering and fal&s;e hopes. We all know how fa&s;cinating the vice of gaming is, and how difficult it is, al&s;o, to conquer habit; the Chevalier might, perhaps, reform for a while, but he would &s;oon relap&s;e into di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;for I fear, not only the bonds of habit would be powerful, but, that his morals are corrupted. And&mdash;why &s;hould I conceal from you, that play is not his only vice? he appears to have a ta&s;te for every vicious plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>The Count he&s;itated and pau&s;ed; while Emily endeavoured to &s;upport her&s;elf, as, with increa&s;ing perturbation, &s;he ex|pected what he might further &s;ay. A long pau&s;e of &s;ilence en&s;ued, during which he was vi&s;ibly agitated; at length, he &s;aid, "It would be a cruel delicacy, that could prevail with me to be &s;ilent&mdash;and I will inform you, that the Chevalier's extrava|gance has brought him twice into the pri&s;ons of Paris, from whence he was la&s;t extricated, as I was told upon authority, which I cannot doubt, by a well known Pari&s;ian Counte&s;s, with whom he continued to re&s;ide, when I left Paris."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed again; and, looking at Emily, perceived her coun|tenance change, and that &s;he was falling from the &s;eat; he caught her, but &s;he had fainted, and he called loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. They were, however, beyond the hearing of his &s;ervants at the chateau, and he feared to leave her while he went thither for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet knew not how otherwi&s;e to obtain it; till a fountain at no great di&s;tance caught his eye, and he endeavoured to &s;upport Emily again&s;t the tree, under which &s;he had been &s;itting, while he went thither for water. But, again he was perplexed, for he had nothing near him, in which water could be brought, but while, with increa&s;ed anxiety, he watched her, he thought he perceived in her countenance &s;ymptoms of returning life.</P>
<P>It was long, however, before &s;he revived, and &s;he then found her&s;elf &s;upported&mdash;not by the Count but by Valancourt, who was ob&s;erving her with looks of earne&s;t apprehen&s;ion, and who now &s;poke to her in a tone, tremulous with his anxiety. At the &s;ound of his well known voice, &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, but pre&s;ently clo&s;ed them, and a faintne&s;s again came over her.</P>
<P>The Count, with a look &s;omewhat &s;tern, waved him to with|draw; but he only &s;ighed heavily, and called on the name of Emily, as he again held the water, that had been brought, to her lips. On the Count's repeating his action, and accompany|ing
<PB N="70" REF="029378_0262_0FE0862D2ED1CF30">
it with words, Valancourt an&s;wered him with a look of deep re&s;entment, and refu&s;ed to leave the place, till &s;he &s;hould revive, or to re&s;ign her for a moment to the care of any per&s;on. In the next in&s;tant, his con&s;cience &s;eemed to inform him of what had been the &s;ubject of the Count's conver&s;ation with Emily, and indignation fla&s;hed in his eyes; but it was quickly repre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ucceeded by an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;erious angui&s;h, that induced the Count to regard him with more pity than re&s;entment, and the view of which &s;o much affected Emily, when &s;he again re|vived, that &s;he yielded to the weakne&s;s of tears. But &s;he &s;oon re&s;trained them, and, exerting her re&s;olution to appear recovered, &s;he ro&s;e, thanked the Count and Henri, with whom Valancourt had entered the garden, for their care, and moved towards the chateau, without noticing Valancout, who, heart &s;truck by her manner, exclaimed in a low voice&mdash;"Good God! how have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;erved this?&mdash;what has been &s;aid, to occa&s;ion this change?"</P>
<P>Emily, without replying, but with increa&s;ed emotion, quick|ened her &s;teps. "What has thus di&s;ordered you, Emily?" &s;aid he, as he &s;till walked by her &s;ide: "give me a few moments conver&s;ation, I entreat you;&mdash;I am very mi&s;erable!"</P>
<P>Though this was &s;poken in a low voice, it was overheard by the Count, who immediately replied, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat Mademoi&s;elle St. Au|bert was then too much indi&s;po&s;ed, to attend to any con|ver&s;ation, but that he would venture to promi&s;e &s;he would &s;ee Mon&s;ieur Valancourt on the morrow, if &s;he was better.</P>
<P>Valancourt's cheek was crim&s;oned; he looked haughtily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Count, and then at Emily, with &s;ucce&s;&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ur|pri&s;e, grief and &s;upplication, which &s;he could neither mi&s;under|&s;tand, or re&s;i&s;t, and &s;he &s;aid languidly&mdash;"I &s;hall be better to|morrow, and if you wi&s;h to accept the Count's permi&s;&s;ion, I will &s;ee you then."</P>
<P>"See me!" exclaimed Valancourt, as he threw a glance of mingled pride and re&s;entment upon the Count; and then, &s;eem|ing to recollect him&s;elf, he added&mdash;"But I will come, madam; I will accept the Count's <HI>permi&s;&s;ion."</HI></P>
<P>When they reached the door of the chateau, he lingered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> moment, for his re&s;entment was now fled; and then, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> look &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of tenderne&s;s and grief, that Emily's heart was not proof again&s;t it, he bade her good morning, and bow|ing &s;lightly to the Count, di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew to her own apartment, under &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion of heart as &s;he had &s;eldom known, when &s;he endeavoured to re|collect all that the Count had told, to examine the probability of the circum&s;tances he him&s;elf believed, and to con&s;ider of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="71" REF="029378_0262_0FE0862D2ED1CF30">
future conduct towards Valancourt. But, when &s;he attempted to think, her mind refu&s;ed controul, and &s;he could only feel that &s;he was mi&s;erable. One moment, &s;he &s;unk under the convic|tion, that Valancourt was no longer the &s;ame, whom &s;he had &s;o tenderly loved, the idea of whom had hitherto &s;upported her under affliction, and cheered her with the hope of happier days,&mdash;but a fallen, a worthle&s;s character, whom &s;he mu&s;t teach her&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to de&s;pi&s;e&mdash;if &s;he could not forget. Then, unable to endure this terrible &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;he rejected it, and di&s;dained to believe him capable of conduct, &s;uch as the Count had de&s;cribed, to whom &s;he believed he had been mi&s;repre&s;ented by &s;ome artful enemy; and there were moments, when &s;he even ventured to doubt the integrity of the Count him&s;elf, and to &s;u&s;pect, that he was in|fluenced by &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h motive to break her connection with Valancourt. But this was the error of an in&s;tant, only; the Count's character which &s;he had heard &s;poken of by Du Pont and many other per&s;ons, and had her&s;elf ob&s;erved, enabled her to judge, and forbade the &s;uppo&s;ition; had her confidence, in|deed, been le&s;s, there appeared to be no temptation to betray him into conduct &s;o treacherous, and &s;o cruel. Nor did reflec|tion &s;uffer her to pre&s;erve the hope, that Valancourt had been mi&s;repre&s;ented to the Count, who had &s;aid, that he &s;poke chief|ly from his own ob&s;ervation, and from his &s;on's experience. She mu&s;t part from Valancourt, therefore, for ever&mdash;for what of ei|ther happine&s;s or tranquillity could &s;he expect with a man, who&s;e ta&s;tes were degenerated into low inclinations, and to whom vice was become habitual? whom &s;he mu&s;t no longer e&s;teem, though the remembrance of what he once was, and the long habit of loving him, would render it very difficult for her to de&s;pi&s;e him.</P>
<P>"O Valancourt!" &s;he would exclaim, "having been &s;eparated &s;o long, do we meet, only to be mi&s;erable&mdash;only to part for ever."</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the tumult of her mind, &s;he remembered pertina|ciou&s;ly the &s;eeming candour and &s;implicity of his conduct, on the preceding night; and, had &s;he dared to tru&s;t her own heart, it would have led her to hope much from this. Still &s;he could not re&s;olve to di&s;mi&s;s him for ever, without obtaining further proof of his ill conduct; yet &s;he &s;aw no probability of procuring it, if, indeed proof more po&s;itive was po&s;&s;ible. Something, how|ever, it was nece&s;&s;ary to decide upon, and &s;he almo&s;t determined to be guided in her opinion &s;olely by the manner, with which Valancourt &s;hould receive her hints concerning his late conduct.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the hours till dinner time, when Emily, &s;truggling again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of her grief, dried her tears, and joined the family at table, where the Count pre&s;erved towards her the mo&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="029378_0263_0FE0863C2EE53BD8">
delicate attention; but the Counte&s;s and Mademoi&s;elle Beam, having looked, for a moment, with &s;urpri&s;e, on her dejected coun|tenance, began, as u&s;ual, to talk of trifles, while the eyes of Lady Blanche a&s;ked much of her friend, who could only reply by a mournful &s;mile.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew as &s;oon after dinner as po&s;&s;ible, and was fol|lowed by the Lady Blanche, who&s;e anxious inquiries, however, &s;he found her&s;elf quite unequal to an&s;wer, and whom &s;he entreated to &s;pare her on the &s;ubject of her di&s;tre&s;s. To conver&s;e on any topic, was now, indeed, &s;o extremely painful to her, that &s;he &s;oon gave up the attempt, and Blanche left her, with pity of the &s;or|row, which &s;he perceived &s;he had no power to a&s;&s;uage.</P>
<P>Emily &s;ecretly determined to go to her convent in a day or two; for company, e&s;pecially that of the Counte&s;s and Made|moi&s;elle Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, was intolerable to her, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits; and, in the retirement of the convent, as well as the kindne&s;s of the abbe&s;s, &s;he hoped to recover the command of her mind, and to teach it re&s;ignation to the event, which, &s;he too plainly perceived, was approaching.</P>

<BIBL>MIDSUMMER NIGHT's DREAM.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the evening, when Emily was at length informed, that Count De Villefort reque&s;ted to &s;ee her, &s;he gue&s;&s;ed that Valan|court was below, and, endeavouring to a&s;&s;ume compo&s;ure and to recollect all her &s;pirits, &s;he ro&s;e and left the apartment; but on reaching the door of the library, where &s;he imagined him to be, her emotion returned with &s;uch energy, that, fearing to tru&s;t her|&s;elf in the room, &s;he returned into the hall, where &s;he continued for a con&s;iderable time, unable to command her agitated &s;pirits.</P>
<P>When &s;he could recall them, &s;he found in the library Valan|court, &s;eated with the Count, who both ro&s;e on her entrance; but &s;he did not dare to look at Valancourt, and the Count, hav|ing led her to a chair, immediately withdrew.</P>
<P>Emily remained with her eyes fixed on the floor, under &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion of heart, that &s;he could not &s;peak, and with difficulty breathed; while Valancourt threw him&s;elf into a chair be&s;ide her, and, &s;ighing heavily, continued &s;ilent, when, had &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, &s;he would have perceived the violent emotions, with which he was agitated.</P>
<P>At length, in a tremulous voice, he &s;aid, "I have &s;olicited to &s;ee you this evening, that I might, at lea&s;t, be &s;pared the further torture of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, which your altered manner had occa&s;ioned me, and which the hints I have ju&s;t received from the Count have in part explained. I perceive I have enemies, Emily, who envied me my late happine&s;s, and who have been bu&s;y in &s;earch|ing out the means to de&s;troy it: I perceive, too, that time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ab&s;ence have weakened the affection you once felt for me, and that you can now ea&s;ily be taught to forget me."</P>
<P>His la&s;t words faltered, and Emily, le&s;s able to &s;peak than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, continued &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"O what a meeting is this!" exclaimed Valancourt, &s;tarting from his &s;eat, and pacing the room with hurried &s;teps, "what a meeting is this, after our long&mdash;long &s;eparation!" Again he &s;at down, and, after the &s;truggle of a moment, he added in a firm but de&s;pairing tone, "This is too much&mdash;I cannot bear it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emily, will you not &s;peak to me?"</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="029378_0264_0FE08640C6A293F0">
He covered his face with his hand, as if to conceal his emo|tion, and took Emily's, which &s;he did not withdraw. Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> longer be re&s;trained; and, when he rai&s;ed his eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> perceived that &s;he was weeping, all his tenderne&s;s returned, and a gleam of hope appeared to cro&s;s his mind, for he exclaimed, "O! you &s;o pity me, then, you do love me! Yes, you are &s;till my own Emily&mdash;let me believe tho&s;e tears, that tell me &s;o!"</P>
<P>Emily now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an effort to recover her firmne&s;s, and, ha&s;tily drying them, "Yes," &s;aid &s;he, "I do pity you&mdash;I weep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you&mdash;but, ought I to think of you with affection? You may remember that ye&s;ter evening I &s;aid, I had &s;till &s;ufficient confidence in your candour to believe, that, when I &s;hould reque&s;t an expla|nation of your words, you would give it. This explanation is now unnece&s;&s;ary, I under&s;tand them too well; but prove, at lea&s;t, that your candour is de&s;erving of the confidence I give it, when I a&s;k you, whether you are con&s;cious of being the &s;ame e&s;timable Valancourt&mdash;whom I once loved."</P>
<P>"Once loved!" cried he,&mdash;"the &s;ame&mdash;the &s;ame!" He pau&s;|ed in extreme emotion, and then added, in a voice at once &s;o|lemn, and dejected,&mdash;"No&mdash;I am not the &s;ame!&mdash;I am lo&s;t&mdash;I am no longer worthy of you!"</P>
<P>He again concealed his face. Emily was too much affected by this hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion to reply immediately, and, while &s;he &s;trug|gled to overcome the pleadings of her heart, and to act with the deci&s;ive firmne&s;s, which was nece&s;&s;ary for her future peace, &s;he perceived all the danger of tru&s;ting long to her re&s;olution, in the pre&s;ence of Valancourt, and was anxious to conclude an inter|view, that tortured them both; yet, when &s;he con&s;idered, that this was probably their la&s;t meeting, her fortitude &s;unk at once, and &s;he experienced only emotions of tenderne&s;s and of de&s;pon|dency.</P>
<P>Valancourt, meanwhile, lo&s;t in emotions of remor&s;e and grief, which he had neither the power, or the will to expre&s;s, &s;at in&s;en|&s;ible almo&s;t of the pre&s;ence of Emily, his features &s;till concealed, and his brea&s;t agitated by convul&s;ive &s;ighs.</P>
<P>"Spare me the nece&s;&s;ity," &s;aid Emily, recollecting her forti|tude, "&s;pare me the nece&s;&s;ity of mentioning tho&s;e circum&s;tances of your conduct, which oblige me to break our connection for ever. We mu&s;t part, I now &s;ee you for the la&s;t time."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" cried Valancourt, rou&s;ed from his deep &s;ilence. "You cannot mean what you &s;ay!&mdash;you cannot mean to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me from you for ever!"</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t part," repeated Emily, with empha&s;is, "and that for ever! Your own conduct has made this nece&s;&s;ary."</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="029378_0264_0FE08640C6A293F0">
"This is the Count's determination," &s;aid he haughtily, "not yours, and I &s;hall inquire by what authority he interferes be|tween us." He now ro&s;e, and walked about the room in great emotion.</P>
<P>"Let me &s;ave you from this error," &s;aid Emily, not le&s;s agi|tated, "it is my determination, and, if you reflect a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on your late conduct, you will perceive, that my future peace requires it."</P>
<P>"Your future peace requires, that we &s;hould part! part for ever!" &s;aid Valancourt, "How little did I ever expect to hear you &s;ay &s;o!"</P>
<P>"And how little did I expect, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay &s;o!" rejoined Emily, while her voice &s;oftened into tenderne&s;s, and her tears flowed again.&mdash;"That you&mdash;you; Valancourt, would ever fall from my e&s;teem!"</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent a moment, as if overwhelmed by the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of no longer de&s;erving this e&s;teem, as well as the cer|tainty of having lo&s;t it, and then, with impa&s;&s;ioned grief, lament|ed the criminality of his late conduct and the mi&s;ery to which it had reduced him, till, overcome by a recollection of the pa&s;t and a conviction of the future, he bur&s;t into tears, and uttered only deep and broken &s;ighs.</P>
<P>The remor&s;e he had expre&s;&s;ed, and the di&s;tre&s;s he &s;uffered could not be witne&s;&s;ed by Emily with indifference, and, had &s;he not called to her recollection all the circum&s;tances, of which Count De Villefort had informed her, and all he had &s;aid of the danger of confiding in repentance, formed under the influ|ence of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he might, perhaps, have tru&s;ted to the a&s;&s;urances of her heart, and have forgotten his mi&s;conduct in the tender|ne&s;s which that repentance excited.</P>
<P>Valancourt, returning to the chair be&s;ide her, at length, &s;aid, in a calm voice," 'Tis true, I am fallen&mdash;fallen from my own e&s;teem! but could you, Emily, &s;o &s;oon, &s;o &s;uddenly re&s;ign, if you had not before cea&s;ed to love me, or, if your conduct was not governed by the de&s;igns, I will &s;ay, the &s;elfi&s;h de&s;igns of an|other per&s;on! Would you not otherwi&s;e be willing to hope for my reformation&mdash;and could you bear, by e&s;tranging me from you, to abandon me to mi&s;ery&mdash;to my&s;elf!"&mdash;Emily wept aloud. "No, Emily&mdash;no&mdash;you would not do this, if you &s;till loved me. You would find your own happine&s;s in &s;aving mine."</P>
<P>"There are too many probabilities again&s;t that hope," &s;aid Emily, "to ju&s;tify me in tru&s;ting the comfort of my whole

life to it. May I not al&s;o a&s;k, whether you could wi&s;h me to do this, if you really loved me?"</P>
<P>"Really loved you!" exclaimed Valancourt&mdash;"is it po&s;&s;i|ble you can doubt my love! Yet it is rea&s;onable, that you &s;hould do &s;o, &s;ince you &s;ee, that I am le&s;s ready to &s;uffer the horror of parting with you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> than, that of involving you in my ruin. Yes, Emily, I am ruined, irreparably ruined! I am involved in debts, which I can never di&s;charge!" Valancourt's look, which was wild, as he &s;poke this, &s;oon &s;ettled into an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of gloomy de&s;pair; and Emily, while &s;he was compell|ed to admire his &s;incerity, &s;aw, with unutterable angui&s;h, new rea&s;ons for fear in the &s;uddenne&s;s of his feelings and the extent of the mi&s;ery, in which they might involve him. After &s;ome minutes, &s;he &s;eemed to contend again&s;t her grief and to &s;trug|gle for fortitude to conclude the interview. "I will not pro|long the&s;e moments," &s;aid &s;he, "by a conver&s;ation, which can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e. Valancourt, farewel!"</P>
<P>"You are not going?" &s;aid he, wildly interrupting her, "you will not leave me thus&mdash;you will not abondon me even before my mind has &s;ugge&s;ted any po&s;&s;ibility of compromi&s;e be|tween the la&s;t indulgence of my de&s;pair and the endurance of my lo&s;s!" Emily was terrified by the &s;ternne&s;s of his look, and &s;aid, in a &s;oothing voice, "You have your&s;elf acknowledged, that it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">;&mdash;if you wi&s;h, that I &s;hould believe you love me, you will repeat the acknowledgement."&mdash;"Never&mdash;never," cried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&mdash;"I was di&s;tracted when I made it. O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emily, this is too much; though you are not deceived as to my faults, you mu&s;t be deluded into this exa&s;peration again&s;t them. The Count is the barrier between us; but he &s;hall not long re|main &s;o."</P>
<P>"You are, indeed, di&s;tracted," &s;aid Emily, "the Count is not your enemy; on the contrary, he is my friend, and that might, in &s;ome degree, induce you to con&s;ider him as yours." "Your friend!" &s;aid Valancourt, ha&s;tily, "how long has he been your friend, that he can &s;o ea&s;ily make you forget your lover? Was it he, who recommended to your favour the Mon|&s;ieur Du Pont, who, you &s;ay, accompanied you from Italy, and who, I &s;ay, has &s;tolen your affections? But I have no right to que&s;tion you; you are your own mi&s;tre&s;s. Du Pont, perhaps, may not long triumph over my fallen fortunes!" Emily, more frightened than before by the frantic looks of Valancourt, &s;aid, in a tone &s;carcely audible, "For heaven's &s;ake be rea&s;onable, be compo&s;ed. Mon&s;ieur Du Pont is not your rival, nor is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="77" REF="029378_0265_0FE0864E5DA2FD88">
Count his advocate. You have no rival; nor, except your&s;elf, an enemy. My heart is wrung with angui&s;h, which mu&s;t in|crea&s;e while your frantic behaviour &s;hews me, more than ever, that you are no longer the Valancourt I have been accu&s;tomed to love."</P>
<P>He made no reply, but &s;at with his arms re&s;ted on the ta|ble and his face concealed by his hands; while Emily &s;tood, &s;ilent and trembling, wretched for her&s;elf and dreading to leave him in this &s;tate of mind.</P>
<P>"O exce&s;s of mi&s;ery!" he &s;uddenly exclaimed, "that I can never lament my &s;ufferings, without accu&s;ing my&s;elf, nor re|member you, without recollecting the folly and the vice, by which I have lo&s;t you! Why was I forced to Paris, and why did I yield to allurements, which were to make me de&s;picable for ever! O! why cannot I look back, without interruption, to tho&s;e days of innocence and peace, the days of our early love!" The recollection &s;eemed to melt his heart, and the frenzy of de|&s;pair yielded to tears. After a long pau&s;e, turning towards her and taking her hand, he &s;aid, in a &s;oftened voice, "Emily, can you bear that we &s;hould part, can you re&s;olve to give up a heart, that loves you like mine, an heart, which, though it has erred, widely erred, is not irretrievable from error, as you well know, it never can be retrievable from love?" Emily made no reply but with her tears. "Can you," continued he, "can you forget all our former days of happine&s;s and confidence, when I had not a thought, that I might wi&s;h to conceal from you, when I had no ta&s;te, no plea&s;ures, in which you did not par|ticipate?"</P>
<P>"O do not lead me to the remembrance of tho&s;e days," &s;aid Emily, "unle&s;s you can teach me to forget the pre&s;ent; I do not mean to reproach you; if I did, I &s;hould be &s;pared the&s;e tears; but why will you render your pre&s;ent &s;ufferings more con&s;picuous, by contra&s;ting them with your former virtues?"</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e virtues," &s;aid Valancourt, "might, perhaps, again be mine, if your affection, which nurtured them, was unchanged; but I fear, indeed, I &s;ee, that you can no longer love me; el&s;e the happy hours, which we have pa&s;&s;ed together, would plead for me, and you could not look back upon them unmoved. Yet, why &s;hould I torture my&s;elf with the remembrance, why do I linger here? Am I not ruined, would it not be madne&s;s to inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e you in my misfortunes, even if your heart was &s;till my own? I will not di&s;tre&s;s you further. Yet, before I go," added he, in a &s;olemn voice, "let me repeat, that, whatever may be
<PB N="78" REF="029378_0266_0FE06980B8EBFDB0">
my de&s;tiny, whatever I may be doomed to &s;uffer, I mu&s;t always love you, mo&s;t fondly love you! I am going, Emily, I am go|ing to leave you, to leave you, for ever!" As he &s;poke the la&s;t words, his voice trembled, and he threw him&s;elf again into the chair, from which he had ri&s;en. Emily was utterly unable to leave the room, or to &s;ay farewel. All impre&s;&s;ion of his crim|inal conduct and almo&s;t of his follies was obliterated from her mind, and &s;he was &s;en&s;ible only of pity and grief.</P>
<P>"My fortitude is gone," &s;aid Valancourt at length; "I can no longer even &s;truggle to recall it. I cannot now leave you, I cannot bid you an eternal farewel; &s;ay, as lea&s;t, that you will &s;ee me once again." Emily's heart was &s;omewhat relieved by the reque&s;t, and &s;he endeavoured to believe, that &s;he ought not to refu&s;e it. Yet &s;he was embarra&s;&s;ed by recollecting, that &s;he was a vi&s;itor in the hou&s;e of the Count, who could not be plea&s;ed by the return of Valancourt. Other con&s;iderations, however, &s;oon overcame this, and &s;he granted his reque&s;t, on the condition, that he would neither think of the Count, as his enemy, nor Du Pont as his rival. He then left her, with a heart &s;o much lightened by this &s;hort re&s;pite, that he almo&s;t lo&s;t every former &s;en&s;e of misfortune.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew to her own room, that &s;he might compo&s;e her &s;pirits and remove the traces of her tears, which would encou|rage the cen&s;orious remarks of the Counte&s;s and her favourite, as well as excite the curio&s;ity of the re&s;t of the family. She found it, however, impo&s;&s;ible to tranquillize her mind, from which &s;he could not expel the remembrance of the late &s;cene with Valancourt, or the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;he was to &s;ee him again, on the morrow. This meeting now appeared more ter|rible to her than the la&s;t, for the ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion he had made of his ill conduct and his embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, with the &s;trength and tenderne&s;s of affection, which this confe&s;&s;ion di&s;covered, had deeply impre&s;&s;ed her, and, in &s;pite of all &s;he had heard and believed to his di&s;advantage, her e&s;teem began to re|turn. It frequently appeared to her impo&s;&s;ible, that he could have been guilty of the depravities reported of him, which, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not incon&s;i&s;tent with his warmth and impetuo&s;ity, were entirely &s;o with his candour and &s;en&s;ibility. Whatever was the crimi|nality, which had given ri&s;e to the reports, &s;he could not now believe them to be wholly true, nor that his heart was finally clo&s;ed again&s;t the charms of virtue. The deep con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, which he felt as well as expre&s;&s;ed of his errors, &s;eemed to ju&s;tify the opinion; and, as &s;he under&s;tood not the in&s;tability of youth|ful
<PB N="79" REF="029378_0266_0FE06980B8EBFDB0">
di&s;po&s;itions, when oppo&s;ed by habit, and that profe&s;&s;ions fre|quently deceive tho&s;e, who make, as well as tho&s;e, who hear them, &s;he might have yielded to the flattering per&s;ua&s;ions of her own heart and the pleadings of Valancourt, had &s;he not been guided by the &s;uperior prudence of the Count. He repre&s;ented to her, in a clear light, the danger of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, that of li&s;tening to promi&s;es of amendment, made under the influence of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, and the flight hope, which could attach to a connection, who&s;e chance of happine&s;s re&s;ted upon the retrieval of ruined circum&s;tances and the reform of corrupted habits. On the&s;e accounts, he lamented, that Emily had con&s;ented to a &s;e|cond interview, for he &s;aw how much it would &s;hake her re&s;olu|tion and increa&s;e, the difficulty of her conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Her mind was now &s;o entirely occupied by nearer intere&s;ts, that &s;he forgot the old hou&s;ekeeper and the promi&s;ed hi&s;tory, which &s;o lately had excited her curio&s;ity, but which Dorothee was probably not very anxious to di&s;clo&s;e, for night came, the hours pa&s;&s;ed; and &s;he did not appear in Emily's chamber. With the latter it was a &s;leeple&s;s and di&s;mal night; the more &s;he &s;uffered her memory to dwell on the late &s;cenes with Valan|court, the more her re&s;olution declined, and &s;he was obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">collect all the arguments, which the Count had made u&s;e of to &s;trengthen it, and all the precepts, which &s;he had received from her decea&s;ed father, on the &s;ubject of &s;elf command, to enable her to act, with prudence and dignity, on this the mo&s;t &s;evere occa&s;ion of her life. There were moments, when all her forti|tude for&s;ook her, and when, remembering the confidence of for|mer times, &s;he thought it impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;he could renounce Valancourt. His reformation then appeared certain; the ar|guments of Count De Villefort were forgotten; &s;he readily be|lieved all &s;he wi&s;hed, and was willing to encounter any evil rather than that of an immediate &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the night in ineffectual &s;truggles between affection and rea&s;on, and &s;he ro&s;e, in the morning, with a mind, weaken|ed and irre&s;olute, and a frame, trembling with illne&s;s.</P>

<P>VALANCOURT, meanwhile, &s;uffered the tortures of re|mor&s;e and de&s;pair. The &s;ight of Emily had renewed all the ardour, with which he fir&s;t loved her, and which had &s;uffered a temporary abatement from ab&s;ence and the pa&s;&s;ing &s;cenes of bu|&s;y life. When, on the receipt of her letter, he &s;et out for Lan|guedoc, he then knew, that his own folly had involved him in ruin, and it was no part of his de&s;ign to conceal this from her. But he lamented only the delay which his ill conduct mu&s;t give to their marriage, and did not fore&s;ee, that the information could induce her to break their connection for ever. While the pro&s;pect of this &s;eparation overwhelmed his mind, before &s;tung with &s;elf reproach, he awaited their &s;econd interview, in a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction, yet was &s;till inclined to hope, that his pleadings might prevail upon her not to exact it. In the morn|ing, he &s;ent to know at what hour &s;he would &s;ee him; and his note arrived, when &s;he was with the Count, who had &s;ought a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> opportunity of again conver&s;ing with her of Valancourt; for he perceived the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of her mind, and feared, more than ever, that her fortitude would de&s;ert her. Emily having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the me&s;&s;enger, the Count returned to the &s;ubject of their late conver&s;ation, urging his fear of Valancourt's entreaties, and again pointing out to her the lengthened mi&s;ery, that mu&s;t en|&s;ue, if &s;he &s;hould refu&s;e to encounter &s;ome pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s. His repeated arguments could, indeed, alone have protected her from the affection &s;he &s;till felt for Valancourt, and &s;he re&s;olved to be governed by them.</P>
<P>The hour of interview, at length, arrived. Emily went to it, at lea&s;t, with compo&s;ure of manner, but Valancourt was &s;o much agitated, that he could not &s;peak, for &s;everal minutes, and his fir&s;t words were alternately tho&s;e of lamentation, entreaty and &s;elf reproach. Afterward, he &s;aid, "Emily, I have loved you, I do love you better than my life; but I am ruined by my own conduct. Yet I would &s;eek to entangle you in a connection, that mu&s;t be mi&s;erable for you, rather than &s;ubject my&s;elf to the puni&s;hment which is my due, the lo&s;s of you. I am a wretch, but I will be a villain no longer. I will not endeavour to &s;hake your re&s;olution by the pleadings of a &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion. I re&s;ign you, Emily, and will endeavour to find con&s;olation in con&s;ider|ing,
<PB N="81" REF="029378_0267_0FE086582F9EFE88">
that, though I am mi&s;erable, you at lea&s;t may be happy. The merit of the &s;acrifice is, indeed, not my own, for I &s;hould never, have attained &s;trength of mind to &s;urrender you, if your prudence had not demanded it."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a moment, while Emily attempted to conceal the tears, which came to her eyes. She would have &s;aid, "You &s;peak now, as you were wont to do," but &s;he checked her&s;elf&mdash;"Forgive me, Emily," &s;aid he, "all the &s;ufferings I have oc|ca&s;ioned you, and &s;ometimes, when you think of the wretched Valancourt, remember, that his only con&s;olation would be to believe, that you are no longer unhappy by his folly." The tears now fell fa&s;t upon her cheek, and he was relap&s;ing into the phrenzy of de&s;pair, when Emily endeavoured to recall her for|titude and to terminate an interview, which only &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e the di&s;tre&s;s of both. Perceiving her tears and that &s;he was ri&s;ing to go, Valancourt, &s;truggled, once more, to overcome his own feelings and to &s;ooth hers. "The remembrance of this &s;orrow," &s;aid he, "&s;hall in future be my protection, O! never again will example, or temptation have power to &s;educe me to evil, exalted as I &s;hall be by the recollection of your grief for me."</P>
<P>Emily was &s;omewhat comforted by this a&s;&s;urance. "We are now parting for ever," &s;aid &s;he; "but, if my happine&s;s is dear to you, you will always remember, that nothing can con|tribute to it more than to believe, that you have recovered your own e&s;teem." Valancourt took her hand; his eyes were cov|ered with tears, and the farewel he would have &s;poken was lo&s;t in &s;ighs. After a few moments, Emily &s;aid with difficulty and emotion, "Farewel, Valancourt, may you be happy!" She re|peated her "farewel," and attempted to withdraw her hand, but he &s;till held it and bathed it with his tears. "Why pro|long the&s;e moments?" &s;aid Emily, in a voice &s;carcely audible, "they are too painful to us both." "This is too, too much," exclaimed Valancourt, re&s;igning her hand and throwing him&s;elf into a chair, where he covered his face with his hands, and was overcome, for &s;ome moments, by convul&s;ive &s;ighs. After a long pau&s;e, during which Emily wept in &s;ilence, and Valan|court &s;eemed &s;truggling with his grief, &s;he again ro&s;e to take leave of him. Then, endeavouring to recover his compo&s;ure, "I am again afflicting you," &s;aid he, "but let the angui&s;h I &s;uffer, plead for me." He then added, in a &s;olemn voice, which frequently trembled with the agitation of his heart, "Farewel,
<PB N="82" REF="029378_0268_0FE0865F0A87F028">
Emily, you will always be the only object of my tenderne&s;s. Sometimes you will think of the unhappy Valancourt, and it will be with pity, though it may not be with e&s;teem. O! what is the whole world to me, without you, without your e&s;teem!" He checked him&s;elf, "I am falling again into the error I have ju&s;t lamented. I mu&s;t not intrude longer upon your patience, or I &s;hall relap&s;e into de&s;pair."</P>
<P>He once more bade Emily adieu, pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips, looked at her, for the la&s;t time, and hurried out of the room.</P>
<P>Emily remained in the chair, where he had left her, oppre&s;&s;ed with a pain at her heart, which &s;carcely permitted her to breathe, and li&s;tening to his departing &s;teps, &s;inking fainter and fainter, as he cro&s;&s;ed the hall. She was at length rou&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the voice of the Counte&s;s in the garden, and, her attention being then awakened, the fir&s;t object which &s;truck her &s;ight, was the vacant chair, where Valancourt had &s;at. The tears, which had been, for &s;ometime, repre&s;&s;ed by the kind of a&s;toni&s;hment, that followed his departure, now came to her relief, and &s;he was at length, &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to return to her own room.</P>

<P>WE now return to the mention of Montoni, who&s;e rage and di&s;appointment were &s;oon lo&s;t in nearer intere&s;ts, than any, which the unhappy Emily had awakened. His depredations hav|ing exceeded their u&s;ual limits, and reached an extent, at which neither the timidity of the then commercial &s;enate of Venice, nor their hope of his occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance would permit them to connive, the &s;ame effort, it was re&s;olved, &s;hould complete the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his power and the correction of his outrages. While a corps of con&s;iderable &s;trength was upon the point of re|ceiving orders to march for Udolpho, a young officer, prompted partly by re&s;entment, for &s;ome injury, received from Montoni, and partly by the hope of di&s;tinction, &s;olicited an interview with the Mini&s;ter who directed the enterpri&s;e. To him he repre|&s;ented, that the &s;ituation of Udolpho rendered it too &s;trong to be
<PB N="83" REF="029378_0268_0FE0865F0A87F028">
taken by open force, except after &s;ome tedious operations; that Montoni had lately &s;hewn how capaple he was of adding to its &s;trength all the advantages, which could be derived from the &s;kill of a commander; that &s;o con&s;iderable a body of troops, as that allotted to the expedition, could not approach Udolpho with|out his knowledge, and that it was not for the honour of the re|public to have a large part of its regular force employed, for &s;uch a time as the &s;iege of Udolpho would require, upon the at|tack of a handful of banditti. The object of the expedition, he thought, might be accompli&s;hed much more &s;afely and &s;peed|ily by mingling contrivance with force. It was po&s;&s;ible to meet Montoni and his party, without their walls, and to attack them then; or, by approaching the fortre&s;s, with the &s;ecrecy con|&s;i&s;tent with the march of &s;maller bodies of troops, to take ad|vantage either of the treachery, or negligence of &s;ome of his party, and to ru&s;h unexpectedly upon the whole, even in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho.</P>
<P>This advice was &s;eriou&s;ly attended to, and the officer who gave it, received the command of the troops, demanded for his purpo&s;e. His fir&s;t efforts were accordingly tho&s;e of contrivance alone. In the neighbourhood of Udolpho, he waited, till he had &s;ecured the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal of the condottieri, of whom he found none, that he addre&s;&s;ed, unwilling to puni&s;h their im|perious ma&s;ter, and to &s;ecure their own pardon from the &s;enate. He learned al&s;o the number of Montoni's troops, and that it had been much increa&s;ed, &s;ince his late &s;ucce&s;&s;es. The conclu&s;ion of his plan was &s;oon effected. Having returned with his party, who received the watch word and other a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their friends within, Montoni and his officers were &s;urpri&s;ed by one divi&s;ion, who had been directed to their apartment, while the other main|tained the &s;light combat, which preceded the &s;urrender of the whole garri&s;on. Among the per&s;ons, &s;eized with Montoni, was Or&s;ino, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who had joined him on his fir&s;t arrival at Udolpho, and who&s;e concealment had been made known to the &s;enate by Count Morano, after the un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt of the latter to carry off Emily. It was, indeed, partly for the purpo&s;e of capturing this man, by whom one of the &s;enate had been murdered, that the expedition was undertaken, and its &s;ucce&s;s was &s;o acceptable to them, that Morano was in&s;tantly relea&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the political &s;u&s;picions, which Mon|toni, by his &s;ecret accu&s;ation, had excited again&s;t him. The celerity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, with which this whole tran&s;action was com|pleted, prevented it from attracting curio&s;ity, or even from ob|taining
<PB N="84" REF="029378_0269_0FE0866A22F3C100">
a place in any of the publi&s;hed records of that time; &s;o that Emily, who remained in Languedoc, was ignorant of the defeat and &s;ignal humiliation of her late per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>Her mind was now occupied with &s;ufferings, which no ef|fort of rea&s;on had yet been able to controul. Count de Ville|fort, who &s;incerely attempted whatever benevolence could &s;ug|ge&s;t for &s;oftening them, &s;ometimes allowed her the &s;olitude &s;he wi&s;hed for, &s;ometimes led her into friendly parties, and con|&s;tantly protected her, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from the &s;hrewd in|quiries and critical conver&s;ation of the Counte&s;s. He often in|vited her to make excur&s;ions, with him and his daughter, dur|ing which he conver&s;ed entirely on que&s;tions, &s;uitable to her ta&s;te, without appearing to con&s;ult it, and thus endeavoured grad|ually to withdraw her from the &s;ubject of her grief, and to awake other intere&s;ts in her mind. Emily, to whom he appeared as the enlightened friend and protector of her youth, &s;oon felt for him the render affection of a daughter, and her heart expanded to her young friend Blanche, as to a &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e kindne&s;s and &s;implicity compen&s;ated for the want of more brilliant qualities. It was long before &s;he could &s;ufficiently ab&s;tract her mind from Valancourt to li&s;ten to the &s;tory, promi&s;ed by old Doro|thee, concerning which her curio&s;ity had once been &s;o deeply intere&s;ted; but Dorothee, at length reminded her of it, and Emily de&s;ired that &s;he would come that night to her chamber.</P>
<P>Still her thoughts were employed by con&s;iderations, which weakened her curio&s;ity, and Dorothee's tap at the door, &s;oon after twelve, &s;urpri&s;ed her almo&s;t as much as if it had not been appointed. "I am come, at la&s;t, lady," &s;aid &s;he; "I wonder what it is makes my old limbs &s;hake &s;o, to night. I thought once, or twice, I &s;hould have dropped, as I was a coming." Emily &s;eated her in a chair, and de&s;ired, that &s;he would com|po&s;e her &s;pirits, before &s;he entered upon the &s;ubject, that had brought her thither. "Alas," &s;aid Dorothee, "it is thinking of that, I believe, which has di&s;turbed me &s;o. In my way hither too, I pa&s;&s;ed the chamber, where my dear lady died, and every thing was &s;o &s;till and gloomy about me, that I almo&s;t fancied I &s;aw her as &s;he appeared upon her death bed."</P>
<P>Emily now drew the chair near to Dorothee, who went on. "It is about twenty years &s;ince my lady Marchione&s;s came a bride to the chateau. O! I well remember how &s;he looked, when &s;he came into the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, where we &s;ervants were all a&s;&s;embled to welcome her, and how happy my lord the Marquis &s;eemed. Ah! who would have thought then!&mdash;But, as I was
<PB N="85" REF="029378_0269_0FE0866A22F3C100">
&s;aying, ma'am&s;elle, I thought the Marchione&s;s, with all her &s;weet looks, did not look happy at heart, and &s;o I told my hu&s;band, and he &s;aid it was all fancy; &s;o I &s;aid no more, but I made my remarks, for all that. My lady Marchione&s;s was then about your age, and, as I have often thought, very like you. Well! my lord the Marquis kept open hou&s;e, for a long time, and gave &s;uch entertainments and there were &s;uch gay doings as have never been in the chateau &s;ince. I was younger, ma'am&s;elle, then, than I am now, and was as gay as the be&s;t of them. I remember I danced with Philip, the butler, in a pink gown, with yellow rib|bons, and a coif, not &s;uch as they wear now, but plaited high, with ribbons all about it. It was very becoming truly;&mdash;my lord, the Marquis, noticed me. Ah! he was a good natured gentleman then&mdash;who would have thought that he!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But the Marchione&s;s, Dorothee," &s;aid Emily, "you was telling me of her."</P>
<P>"O yes, my lady Marchione&s;s, I thought &s;he did not &s;eem to be happy at heart, and once, &s;oon after the marriage, I caught her crying in her chamber; but, when &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he dried her eyes, and pretended to &s;mile. I did not dare then to a&s;k what was the matter; but, the next time I &s;aw her crying, I did, and &s;he &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed; &s;o I &s;aid no more. I found out, &s;ome|time after, how it was. Her father, it &s;eems, had commanded her to marry my lord, the Marquis, for his money, and there was another nobleman, or el&s;e a chevalier, that &s;he liked better and that was very fond of her, and &s;he fretted for the lo&s;s of him, I fancy, but &s;he never told me &s;o. My lady always tried to con|ceal her tears from the Marquis, for I have often &s;een her, after &s;he has been &s;o &s;orrowful, look &s;o calm and &s;weet, when he came into the room! But my lord, all of a &s;udden, grew gloomy, fretful, and very unkind, &s;ometimes to my lady. This afflicted her very much, as I &s;aw, for &s;he never complained, and &s;he u&s;ed to try &s;o &s;weetly to oblige him and to bring him into a good humour, that my heart has often ached to &s;ee it. But he u&s;ed to be &s;tubborn, and give her har&s;h an&s;wers, and then, when &s;he found it all in vain, &s;he would go to her own room, and cry &s;o! I u&s;ed to hear her in the anti room, poor dear lady! but I &s;eldom ventured to go to her. I u&s;ed, &s;ometimes, to think my lord was jealous. To be &s;ure my lady was greatly admired, but &s;he was too good to de|&s;erve &s;u&s;picion. Among the many chevaliers, that vi&s;ited at the chateau, there was one, that I always thought &s;eemed ju&s;t &s;uited for my lady; he was &s;o courteous, yet &s;o &s;pirited, and there was &s;uch a grace, as it were, in all he did, or &s;aid. I always ob&s;erved,
<PB N="86" REF="029378_0270_0FE0866FEDC210C8">
that, whenever he had been there, the Marquis was more gloomy and my lady more thoughtful, and it came into my head, that this was the chevalier &s;he ought to have married, but I never could learn for certain."</P>
<P>"What was the chevalier's name, Dorothee?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Why that I will not tell even to you, ma'am&s;elle, for evil may come of it. I once heard from a per&s;on, who is &s;ince dead, that the Marchione&s;s was not in law the wife of the Marquis, for that &s;he had before been privately married to the gentleman &s;he was &s;o much attached to, and was afterwards afraid to own it to her fa|ther, who was a very &s;tern man; but this &s;eems very unlikely, and I never gave much faith to it. As I was &s;aying, the Mar|quis was mo&s;t out of humour, as I thought, when the chevalier I &s;poke of had been at the chateau, and, at la&s;t, his ill treatment of my lady made her quite mi&s;erable. He would &s;ee hardly any vi&s;itors at the ca&s;tle, and made her live almo&s;t by her&s;elf. I was her con&s;tant attendant, and &s;aw all &s;he &s;uffered, but &s;till &s;he never complained.</P>
<P>"After matters had gone on thus, for near a year, my lady was taken ill, and I thought her long fretting had made her &s;o; but, alas! I fear it was wor&s;e than that."</P>
<P>"Wor&s;e! Dorothee," &s;aid Emily, "can that be po&s;&s;ible?"</P>
<P>"I fear it was &s;o, madam, there were &s;trange appearances! But I will only tell what happened. My lord, the Marquis&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h, Dorothee, what &s;ounds were tho&s;e?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>Dorothee changed countenance, and, while they both li&s;tened, they heard, on the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, mu&s;ic of uncommon &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I have &s;urely heard that voice before!" &s;aid Emily, at length.</P>
<P>"I have often heard it, and at this &s;ame hour," &s;aid Doro|thee, &s;olemnly, "and, if &s;pirits ever bring mu&s;ic&mdash;that is &s;urely the mu&s;ic of one!"</P>
<P>Emily, as the &s;ounds drew nearer, knew them to be the &s;ame &s;he had formerly heard at the time of her father's death, and, whether it was the remembrance they now revived of that me|lancholy event, or that &s;he was &s;truck with &s;uper&s;titious awe, it is certain, &s;he was &s;o much affected, that &s;he had nearly fainted.</P>
<P>"I think I once told you, madam," &s;aid Dorothee, "that I fir&s;t heard this mu&s;ic, &s;oon after my lady's death! I well remem|ber the night!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Hark! it comes again!" &s;aid Emily, "let us open the window, and li&s;ten."</P>
<P>They did &s;o; but, &s;oon, the &s;ounds floated gradually away into di&s;tance, and all was again &s;till; they &s;eemed to have &s;unk
<PB N="87" REF="029378_0270_0FE0866FEDC210C8">
among the woods, who&s;e tufted tops were vi&s;ible upon the clear horizon, while every other feature of the &s;cene was involved in the night &s;hade, which, however, allowed the eye an indi&s;tinct view of &s;ome objects in the garden below.</P>
<P>As Emily leaned on the window, gazing with a kind of thril|ling awe upon the ob&s;curity beneath, and then upon the cloud|le&s;s arch above, enlightened only by the &s;tars, Dorothee, in a low voice, re&s;umed her narrative.</P>
<P>"I was &s;aying, ma'am&s;elle, that I well remember when fir&s;t I heard that mu&s;ic. It was one night, &s;oon after my lady's death, that I had &s;at up later than u&s;ual, and I don't know how it was, but I had been thinking a great deal about my poor mi&s;tre&s;s, and of the &s;ad &s;cene I had lately witne&s;&s;ed. The cha|teau was quite &s;till, and I was in a chamber at a good di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the &s;ervants, and this, with the mournful things I had been thinking of, I &s;uppo&s;e, made me low &s;pirited, for I felt very lonely and forlorn, as it were, and li&s;tened often, wi&s;h|ing to hear a &s;ound in the chateau, for you know, ma'am&s;elle, when one can hear people moving, one does not &s;o much mind, about one's fears. But all the &s;ervants were gone to bed, and I &s;at thinking and thinking, till I was almo&s;t afraid to look round the room and my poor lady's countenance often came to my mind, &s;uch as I had &s;een her when &s;he was dying, and, once or twice, I almo&s;t thought I &s;aw her before me,&mdash;when &s;uddenly I heard &s;uch &s;weet mu&s;ic! it &s;eemed ju&s;t at my window, and I &s;hall never forget what I felt. I had not power to move from my chair, but then when I thought it was my dear lady's voice, the tears came to my eyes. I had often heard her &s;ing, in her lifetime, and to be &s;ure &s;he had a very fine voice; it had made me cry to hear her many a time, when &s;he has &s;at in her oriel, of an even|ing, playing upon her lute &s;uch &s;ad &s;ongs, and &s;inging &s;o. O! it went to ones heart! I have li&s;tened in the anti chamber, for the hour together, and &s;he would &s;ometimes &s;it playing with the window open, when it was &s;ummer time till it was quite dark, and when I have gone in, to &s;hut it, &s;he has hardly &s;eemed to know what hour it was. But, as I &s;aid, madam, continued Dorothee, "when fir&s;t I heard the mu&s;ic, that came ju&s;t now, I thought it was my late lady's, and I have often thought &s;o again, when I have heard it, as I have done at intervals, ever &s;ince. Sometimes, many months have gone by, but &s;till it has returned."</P>
<P>"It is extraordinary," ob&s;erved Emily, "that no per&s;on has yet di&s;covered the mu&s;ician."</P>
<P>"Aye, ma'am&s;elle, if it had been any thing earthly it would have been di&s;covered long ago, but who could have courage to
<PB N="88" REF="029378_0271_0FE08679A9ECFC88">
follow a &s;pirit, and if they had, what good could it do?&mdash;for &s;pirits <HI>you know,</HI> ma'am, can take any &s;hape, or no &s;hape, and they will be here, one minute, and, the next perhaps, in a quite different place!"</P>
<P>"Pray re&s;ume your &s;tory of the Marchione&s;s," &s;aid Emily, "and acquaint me with the manner of her death."</P>
<P>"I will, ma'am," &s;aid Dorothee, "but &s;hall we leave the window?"</P>
<P>"This cool air refre&s;hes me," replied Emily, "and I love to hear it creep along the woods, and to look upon this du&s;ky land&s;cape. You was &s;peaking of my lord, the Marquis, when the mu&s;ic interrupted us."</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, my lord, the Marquis, became more and more gloomy; and my lady grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, till one night, &s;he was taken very ill, indeed. I was called up, and, when I came to her bed &s;ide, I was &s;hocked to &s;ee her counte|nance&mdash;it was &s;o changed! She looked piteou&s;ly up at me, and de&s;ired I would call the Marquis again, for he was not yet come, and tell him &s;he had &s;omething particular to &s;ay to him. At la&s;t, he came, and he did, to be &s;ure, &s;eem very &s;orry to &s;ee her, but he &s;aid very little. My lady told him &s;he felt her&s;elf to be dying, and wi&s;hed to &s;peak with him alone, and then I left the room, but I &s;hall never forget his look as I went."</P>
<P>"When I returned, I ventured to remind my lord about &s;ending for a doctor, for I &s;uppo&s;ed he had forgot to do &s;o, in his grief; but my lady &s;aid it was then too late; but my lord &s;o far from thinking &s;o, &s;eemed to think lightly of her di&s;order&mdash;till &s;he was &s;eized with &s;uch terrible pains! O, I never &s;hall for|get her &s;hriek! My lord then &s;ent off a man and hor&s;e for the doctor, and walked about the room and all over the chateau, in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; and I &s;taid by my dear lady, and did what I could to ea&s;e her &s;ufferings. She had intervals of ea&s;e, and in one of the&s;e &s;he &s;ent for my lord again; when he came, I was going, but &s;he de&s;ired I would not leave her. O! I &s;hall never forget what a &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;I can hardly bear to think of it now! my lord was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, for my lady behaved with &s;o much goodne&s;s, and took &s;uch pains to comfort him, that, if he ever had &s;uffered a &s;u&s;picion to enter his head, he mu&s;t now have been convinced he was wrong. And to be &s;ure he did &s;eem to be overwelmed with the thought of his treat|ment of her and this affected her &s;o much that &s;he fainted away.</P>
<P>"We then got my lord out of the room; he went into his library, and threw him&s;elf on the floor, and there he &s;taid, and
<PB N="89" REF="029378_0271_0FE08679A9ECFC88">
would hear no rea&s;on, that was talked to him. When my lady recovered, &s;he inquired for him, but, afterwards, &s;aid &s;he could not bear to &s;ee his grief, and de&s;ired we would let her die quietly. She died in my arms, ma'am&s;elle, and &s;he went off as peacefully as a child, for all the violence of her di&s;order was pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>Dorothee pau&s;ed, and wept, and Emily wept with her; for &s;he was much affected by the goodne&s;s of the late Marchione&s;s, and by the meek patience, with which &s;he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>"When the doctor came," re&s;umed Dorothee, "alas! he came too late; he appeared greatly &s;hocked to &s;ee her, for &s;oon after her death a frightful blackne&s;s &s;pread all over her face. When he had &s;ent the attendants out of the room, he a&s;ked me &s;everal odd que&s;tions about the Marchione&s;s, particularly concerning the manner, in which &s;he had been &s;eized, and he often &s;hook his head at my an&s;wers, and &s;eemed to mean more, than he cho&s;e to &s;ay. But I under&s;tood him too well. However, I kept my re|marks to my&s;elf, and only told them to my hu&s;band, who bade me hold my tongue. Some of the other &s;ervants, however, &s;u&s;|pected what I did, and &s;trange reports were whi&s;pered about the neighbourhood, but nobody dared to make any &s;tir about them. When my lord heard that my lady was dead, he &s;hut him&s;elf up, and would &s;ee nobody but the doctor, who u&s;ed to be with him alone, &s;ometimes for an hour together; and, after that, the doc|tor never talked with me again about my lady. When &s;he was burried in the church of the convent, at a little di&s;tance yonder, if the moon was up you might &s;ee the towers here, ma'am&s;elle, all my lord's va&s;&s;als followed the funeral, and there was not a dry eye among them, for &s;he had done a deal of good among the poor. My lord, the Marquis, I never &s;aw any body &s;o melan|choly as he was afterwards, and &s;ometimes he would be in &s;uch fits of violence, that we almo&s;t thought he had lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es. He did not &s;tay long at the chateau, but joined his regiment, and, &s;oon after, all the &s;ervants, except my hu&s;band and I, received notice to go, for my lord went to the wars. I never &s;aw him af|ter, for he would not return to the chateau, though it is &s;uch a fine place, and never fini&s;hed tho&s;e fine rooms he was building on the we&s;t &s;ide of it, and it has, in a manner, been &s;hut up ever &s;ince, till my lord the Count came here."</P>
<P>"The death of the Marchione&s;s appears extraordinary," &s;aid Emily, who was anxious to know more than &s;he dared to a&s;k.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," replied Dorothee, "it was extraordinary; I have told you all I &s;aw, and you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s what I think,
<PB N="90" REF="029378_0272_0FE0867F76E90D78">
I cannot &s;ay more, becau&s;e I would not &s;pread reports, that might offend my lord the Count."</P>
<P>"You are very right," &s;aid Emily;&mdash;"where did the Mar|quis die?"&mdash;"In the north of France, I believe, ma'am&s;elle," re|plied Dorothee. "I was very glad, when I heard my lord the Count was coming, for this had been a &s;ad de&s;olate place, the&s;e many years, and we heard &s;uch &s;trange noi&s;es, &s;ometimes, after my lady's death, that as I told you before, my hu&s;band and I left it for a neighbouring cottage. And now, lady, I have told you all this &s;ad hi&s;tory, and all my thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and you have promi&s;ed, you know, never to give the lea&s;t hint about it."&mdash;"I have," &s;aid Emily, "and I will be faithful to my promi&s;e, Dorothee;&mdash;what you have told has intere&s;ted me more than you can imag|ine. I only wi&s;h I could prevail upon you to tell the name of the chevalier, whom you thought &s;o de&s;erving of the Mar|chione&s;s."</P>
<P>Dorothee, however, &s;teadily refu&s;ed to do this, and then re|turned to the notice of Emily's likene&s;s to the late Marchione&s;s. "There is another picture of her," added &s;he, "hanging in a room of the &s;uite, which was &s;hut up. It was drawn, as I have heard, before &s;he was married, and is much more like you than the miniature." When Emily expre&s;&s;ed a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;ee this, Dorothee replied, that &s;he did not like to open tho&s;e rooms; but Emily reminded her that the Count had talked the other day of or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them to be opened; of which Dorothee &s;eemed to con&s;ider much, and then &s;he owned, that &s;he &s;hould feel le&s;s, if &s;he went into them with Emily fir&s;t, than otherwi&s;e, and at length promi&s;ed to &s;hew the picture.</P>
<P>The night was too far advanced and Emily was too much affected by the narrative of the &s;cenes, which had pa&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e apartments, to wi&s;h to vi&s;it them at this hour, but &s;he reque&s;ted that Dorothee would return on the following night, when they were not likely to be ob&s;erved, and conduct her thither. Be|&s;ides her wi&s;h to examine the portrait, &s;he felt a thrilling curio&s;|ity to &s;ee the chamber, in which the Marchione&s;s had died, and which Dorothee had &s;aid remained, with the bed and furniture, ju&s;t as when the corp&s;e was removed for interment. The &s;ol|emn emotions, which the expectation of viewing &s;uch a &s;cene had awakened, were in uni&s;on with the pre&s;ent tone of her mind, depre&s;&s;ed by &s;evere di&s;appointment. Cheerful objects rather added to, than removed this depre&s;&s;ion; but, perhaps, &s;he yield|ed too much to her melancholy inclination, and imprudently la|mented the misfortune, which no virtue of her own could have
<PB N="91" REF="029378_0272_0FE0867F76E90D78">
taught her to avoid, though no effort of rea&s;on could make her look unmoved upon the &s;elf degradation of him, whom &s;he had once e&s;teemed and loved.</P>
<P>Dorothee promi&s;ed to return, on the following night, with the keys of the chambers; and then wi&s;hed Emily, good re|po&s;e, and departed. Emily, however, continued at the window, mu&s;ing upon the melancholy fate of the Marchione&s;s, and li&s;ten|ing in awful expectation, for a return of the mu&s;ic. But the &s;tillne&s;s of the night remained long unbroken, except by the murmuring founds of the woods, as they waved in the breeze, and then by the di&s;tant bell of the convent, &s;triking one. She now withdrew from the window, and, as &s;he &s;at at her bed &s;ide, indulging melancholy reveries, which the loneline&s;s of the hour a&s;&s;i&s;ted, the &s;tillne&s;s was &s;uddenly interrupted, not by mu&s;ic, but by very uncommon &s;ounds, that &s;eemed to come either from the room, adjoining her own, or from one below. The terrible cata&s;trophe, that had been related to her, together with the my&s;|terious circum&s;tances, &s;aid to have &s;ince occurred in the chateau, had &s;o much &s;hocked her &s;pirits, that &s;he now &s;unk, for a mo|ment under the weakne&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition. The &s;ounds, however, did not return, and &s;he retired to forget in &s;leep the di&s;a&s;terous &s;tory &s;he had heard.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the next night, about the &s;ame hour as before, Dorothee came to Emily's chamber, with the keys of that &s;uite of rooms, which had been particularly appropriated to the late Marchione&s;s. The&s;e extended along the north &s;ide of the chateau, forming part of the old building; and, as Emily'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> room was in the &s;outh, they had to pa&s;s over a great extent of the ca&s;tle, and by the chambers of &s;everal of the family, who&s;e ob&s;ervations Dorothee was anxious to avoid, &s;ince it might excite inquiry and rai&s;e re|ports, &s;uch as would di&s;plea&s;e the Count. She, therefore, re|que&s;ted, that Emily would wait half an hour, before they ventur|ed forth, that they might be certain all the &s;ervants were gone to
<PB N="92" REF="029378_0273_0FE0868D29846EE8">
bed. It was nearly one, before the chateau was perfectly &s;till, or Dorothee thought it prudent to leave the chamber. In this interval, her &s;pirits &s;eemed to be greatly affected by the remem|brance of pa&s;t events, and by the pro&s;pect of entering again upon places, where the&s;e had occurred, and in which &s;he had not been for &s;o many years. Emily too was affected, but her feelings had more of &s;olemnity, and le&s;s of fear. From the &s;ilence, into which reflection and expectation had thrown them, they, at length, rou&s;|ed them&s;elves, and left the chamber. Dorothee, at fir&s;t, carried the lamp, but her hand trembled &s;o much with infirmity and alarm, that Emily took it from her, and offered her arm to &s;up|port her feeble &s;teps.</P>
<P>They had to de&s;cend the great &s;tairca&s;e, and, after pa&s;&s;ing over a wide extent of the chateau, to a&s;cend another which led to the &s;uite of rooms they were in que&s;t of. They &s;tepped cautiou&s;ly along the open corridor, that ran round the great hall, and into which the chambers of the Count, Counte&s;s, and the lady Blanche, opened, and, from thence, de&s;cending the chief &s;tairca&s;e, they cro&s;&s;ed the hall it&s;elf. Proceeding through the &s;ervants' hall, where the dying embers of a wood fire &s;till glimmered on the hearth, and the &s;upper table was &s;urrounded by chairs, that ob&s;tructed their pa&s;&s;age, they came to the foot of the back &s;tairca&s;e. Old Doro|thee here pau&s;ed, and looked around; "Let us li&s;ten," &s;aid &s;he, "if any thing is &s;tirring; Ma'am&s;elle, do you hear any voice?" "None," &s;aid Emily, "there certainly is no per&s;on up in the chateau, be&s;ides our&s;elves." "No, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Dorothee, "but I have never been here at this hour before, and, after wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> I know, my fears are not wonderful."&mdash;"What do you know!" &s;aid Emily.&mdash;"O ma'am&s;elle, we have no time for talking now; let us go on. That door on the left is the one we mu&s;t open."</P>
<P>They proceeded, and, having reached the top of the &s;tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;e, Dorothee applied the key to the lock. "Ah," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as &s;he endeavoured to turn it, "&s;o many years have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince this was opened, that I fear it will not move." Emily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more &s;ucce&s;sful, and they pre&s;ently entered a &s;pacious and an|cient chamber.</P>
<P>"Alas!" exclaimed Dorothee, as &s;he entered, "the la&s;t time I pa&s;&s;ed through this door, I followed my poor lady's corp&s;e!"</P>
<P>Emily, &s;truck with the circum&s;tance, and affected by the du&s;ky and &s;olemn air of the apartment, remained &s;ilent, and they pa&s;&s;|ed on through a long &s;uite of rooms, till they came to one more &s;pacious than the re&s;t, and rich in the remains of faded magni|ficence.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="029378_0273_0FE0868D29846EE8">
"Let us re&s;t here, awhile, madam," &s;aid Dorothee, faintly, we are going into the chamber, where my lady died! that door opens into it. Ah, ma'am&s;elle! why did you per&s;uade me to come?"</P>
<P>Emily drew one of the ma&s;&s;y arm chairs with which the apart|ment was furni&s;hed, and begged Dorothee would &s;it down and try to compo&s;e her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"How the &s;ight of this place brings all that pa&s;&s;ed formerly to my mind!" &s;aid Dorothee; "it &s;eems as if it was but ye&s;|terday &s;ince all that &s;ad affair happened!"</P>
<P>"Hark! what noi&s;e is that?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>Dorothee half &s;tarting from her chair, looked round the apart|ment, and they li&s;tened&mdash;but, every thing remaining &s;till, the old woman &s;poke again upon the &s;ubject of her &s;orrow. "This &s;aloon, ma'am&s;elle, was in my lady's time the fine&s;t apartment in the chateau, and it was fitted up according to her own ta&s;te. All this grand furniture, but you can now hardly &s;ee what it is for the du&s;t, and our light is none of the be&s;t&mdash;ah! how I have &s;een this room lighted up in my lady's time!&mdash;all this grand furniture came from Paris, and was made after the fa&s;hion of &s;ome in the Louvre, there, except tho&s;e large gla&s;&s;es, and they came from &s;ome outlandi&s;h place, and that rich tape&s;try. How the colours are faded already!&mdash;&s;ince I &s;aw it la&s;t!"</P>
<P>"I under&s;tood, that was twenty years ago," ob&s;erved Emily.</P>
<P>"Thereabout, madam," &s;aid Dorothee, and well remembered, "but all the time between then and now &s;eems as nothing. That tape&s;try u&s;ed to be greatly admired at, it tells the &s;tories out of &s;ome famous book, or other, but I have forgot the name."</P>
<P>Emily now ro&s;e to examine the figures it exhibited, and di&s;|covered, by ver&s;es in the Provencal tongue, wrought underneath each &s;cene, that it exhibited &s;tories from &s;ome of the mo&s;t cele|brated ancient romances.</P>
<P>Dorothee's &s;pirits being now more compo&s;ed, &s;he ro&s;e, and unlocked the door that led into the late Marchione&s;s's apart|ment, and Emily pa&s;&s;ed into a lofty chamber, hung round with dark arras, and &s;o &s;pacious, that the lamp &s;he held up did not &s;hew its extent; while Dorothee, when &s;he entered, had drop|ped into a chair, where, &s;ighing deeply, &s;he &s;carcely tru&s;ted her|&s;elf with the view of a &s;cene &s;o affecting to her. It was &s;ome|time before Emily perceived, through the du&s;k, the bed on which the Marchione&s;s was &s;aid to have died; when, advancing to the upper end of the room, &s;he di&s;covered the high canopi|ed te&s;ter of dark green dama&s;k, with the curtains de&s;cending
<PB N="94" REF="029378_0274_0FE08691D9DD1418">
to the floor in the fa&s;hion of a tent, half drawn, and remaining apparently, as they had been left twenty years before; and over the whole bedding was thrown a counterpane, or pall, of black velvet, that hung down to the floor. Emily &s;huddered, as &s;he held the lamp over it, and looked within the dark curtains, where &s;he almo&s;t expected to have &s;een a human face, and, &s;ud|denly remembering the horror &s;he had &s;uffered upon di&s;covering the dying Madame Montoni in the turret chamber of Udolpho, her &s;pirits fainted, and &s;he was turning from the bed, when Do|rothee, who had now reached it, exclaimed, "Holy Virgin! methinks I &s;ee my lady &s;tretched upon that pall&mdash;as when la&s;t I &s;aw her!"</P>
<P>Emily, &s;hocked by this exclamation looked involuntarily again within the curtains, but the blackne&s;s of the pall only ap|peared; while Dorothee was compelled to &s;upport her&s;elf upon the &s;ide of the bed, and pre&s;ently tears brought her &s;ome relief.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, after &s;he had wept awhile, "it was here I &s;at on that terrible night, and held my lady's hand, and heard her la&s;t words, and &s;aw all her &s;ufferings&mdash;<HI>here</HI> &s;he died in my arms!"</P>
<P>"Do not indulge the&s;e painful recollections," &s;aid Emily, "let us go. Shew me the picture you mentioned, if it will not too much affect you."</P>
<P>"It hangs in the oriel," &s;aid Dorothee, ri&s;ing, and going towards a &s;mall door near the bed's head, which &s;he opened, and Emily followed with the light, into the clo&s;et of the late Mar|chione&s;s.</P>
<P>"Alas! there &s;he is, ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid Dorothee, pointing to a portrait of a lady, "there is her very &s;elf! ju&s;t as &s;he looked when &s;he came fir&s;t to the chateau. You &s;ee, madam, &s;he was all blooming like you, then&mdash;and &s;o &s;oon to be cut off!"</P>
<P>While Dorothee &s;poke, Emily was attentively examining the picture, which bore a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the miniature, though the expre&s;&s;ion of the countenance in each was &s;ome|what different; but, &s;till &s;he thought &s;he perceived &s;ome|thing of that pen&s;ive melancholy in the portrait, which &s;o &s;trong|ly characteri&s;ed the miniature.</P>
<P>"Pray ma'am&s;elle, &s;tand be&s;ide the picture, that I may look at you together," &s;aid Dorothee, who, when the reque&s;t was complied with, exclaimed again at the re&s;emblance. Emily al&s;o as &s;he gazed upon it, thought that &s;he had &s;omewhere &s;een a per|&s;on very like it, though &s;he could not now recollect who this was.</P>
<P>In this clo&s;et were many memorials of the departed Marchi|one&s;s; a robe and &s;everal articles of her dre&s;s were &s;cattered
<PB N="95" REF="029378_0274_0FE08691D9DD1418">
upon the chairs, as if they had ju&s;t been thrown off. On the floor, were a pair of black &s;attin &s;lippers, and, on the dre&s;&s;ing table, a pair of gloves and a long black veil, which, as Emily took it up to examine, &s;he perceived was dropping to pieces with age.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Dorothee, ob&s;erving the veil, "my lady's hand laid it there; it has never been moved &s;ince!"</P>
<P>Emily, &s;huddering, immediately laid it down again. "I well remember &s;eeing her take it off," continued Dorothee, "it was on the night before her death, when &s;he had returned from a little walk I had per&s;uaded her to take in the gardens, and &s;he &s;eemed refre&s;hed by it. I told her how much better &s;he looked, and I remember what a languid &s;mile &s;he gave me; but, alas! &s;he little thought, or I either, that &s;he was to die, that night."</P>
<P>Dorothee wept again, and then, taking up the veil, threw it &s;uddenly over Emily, who &s;huddered to find it wrapped round her, de&s;cending even to her feet, and, as &s;he endeavoured to throw it off. Dorothee intreated that &s;he would keep it on for one moment. "I thought," added &s;he, "how like you would look to my dear mi&s;tre&s;s in that veil;&mdash;may your life ma'am&s;elle, be a happier one than hers!"</P>
<P>Emily, having di&s;engaged her&s;elf from the veil, laid it again on the dre&s;&s;ing table, and &s;urveyed the clo&s;et, where every object, on which her eye fixed, &s;eemed to &s;peak of the Marchione&s;s. In a large oriel window of painted gla&s;s, &s;tood a table, with a &s;ilver crucifix, and a prayer book open; and Emily remember|ed with emotion what Dorothee had mentioned concerning her cu&s;tom of playing on her lute in this window, before &s;he ob|&s;erved the lute it&s;elf, lying on a corner of the table, as if it had been carele&s;sly placed there by the hand, that had &s;o often awak|ened it.</P>
<P>"This is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad forlorn place!" &s;aid Dorothee, "for, when my dear lady died, I had no heart to put it to rights, or the chamber either; and my lord never came into the rooms after, &s;o they remain ju&s;t as they did when my lady was removed for interment."</P>
<P>While Dorothee &s;poke, Emily was &s;till looking on the lute which was a Spani&s;h one, and remarkably large; and then, with a he&s;itating hand, &s;he took it up, and pa&s;&s;ed her fingers over the chords. They were out of tune, but uttered a deep and full &s;ound. Dorothee &s;tarted at their well known tones, and, &s;eeing the lute in Emily's hand, &s;aid, "This is the lute my lady Marchione&s;s loved &s;o! I remember when la&s;t &s;he played
<PB N="96" REF="029378_0275_0FE0869FD0D357B0">
upon it&mdash;it was on the night that &s;he died. I came as u&s;ual to undre&s;s her, and, as I entered the bed chamber, I heard the &s;ound of mu&s;ic from the oriel, and perceiving it was my lady's, who was &s;itting there, I &s;tepped &s;oftly to the door, which &s;tood a little open, to li&s;ten; for the mu&s;ic, though it was mournful, was &s;o &s;weet! There I &s;aw her, with the lute in her hand, look|ing upwards, and the tears fell upon her cheeks, while &s;he &s;ung a ve&s;per hymn, &s;o &s;oft and &s;o &s;olemn! and her voice trembled, as it were, and then &s;he would &s;top for a moment, and wipe away her tears, and go on again, lower than before. O! I had often li&s;tened to my lady, but never heard any thing &s;o &s;weet as this; it made me cry, almo&s;t, to hear it. She had been at prayers, I fancy, for there was the book open on the table be|&s;ide her&mdash;aye, and there it lies open &s;till! Pray, let us leave the oriel, ma'am&s;elle," added Dorothee, "this is a heart-breaking place!"</P>
<P>Having returned into the chamber, &s;he de&s;ired to look once more upon the bed, when, as they came oppo&s;ite to the open door, leading into the &s;aloon, Emily, in the partial gleam, which the lamp threw into it, thought &s;he &s;aw &s;omething glide along into the ob&s;curer part of the room. Her &s;pirits had been much affected by the &s;urrounding &s;cene, or it is probable this circum|&s;tance, whether real or imaginary, would not have affected her in the degree in did; but &s;he endeavoured to conceal her emo|tion from Dorothee, who, however, ob&s;erving her countenance change, inquired if &s;he was ill.</P>
<P>"Let us go," &s;aid Emily, faintly, "the air of the&s;e rooms is unwhole&s;ome," but, when &s;he attempted to do &s;o, con&s;idering that &s;he mu&s;t pa&s;s through the apartment where the phantom of her terror had appeared, this terror increa&s;ed, and, too faint to &s;upport her&s;elf, &s;he &s;at down on the &s;ide of the bed.</P>
<P>Dorothee, believing that &s;he was only affected by a con&s;id|eration of the melancholy cata&s;trophe, which had happened on this &s;pot, endeavoured to cheer her; and then, as they &s;at to|gether on the bed, &s;he began to relate other particulars concern|ing it, and this without reflecting, that it might increa&s;e Emily's emotion, but becau&s;e they were particularly intere&s;ting to her|&s;elf. "A little before my lady's death," &s;aid &s;he, "when the pains were gone off, &s;he called me to her, and &s;tretching out her hand to me, I &s;at down ju&s;t there&mdash;where the curtain falls upon the bed.

counterpane was not upon the bed then; it was laid on, after her death, and &s;he was laid out upon it."</P>
<P>Emily turned to look within the du&s;ky curtains, as if &s;he could have &s;een the countenance of which Dorothee &s;poke. The edge of the white pillow only appeared above the blackne&s;s of the pall, but, as her eyes wandered over the pall it&s;elf, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw it move. Without &s;peaking, &s;he caught Doro|thee's arm, who, &s;urpri&s;ed by the action, and by the look of terror that accompanied it, turned her eyes from Emily to the bed, where, in the next moment &s;he, too, &s;aw the pall &s;lowly lifted, and fall again.</P>
<P>Emily attempted to go, but Dorothee &s;tood fixed and gazing upon the bed; and, at length &s;aid&mdash;"It is only the wind, that waves it, ma'am&s;elle; we have left all the doors open; &s;ee how the air waves the lamp, too.&mdash;It is only the wind."</P>
<P>She had &s;carcely uttered the&s;e words, when the pall was more violently agitated than before; but Emily, &s;omewhat a&s;hamed of her terrors, &s;tepped back to the bed, willing to be convinced that the wind only had occa&s;ioned her alarm; when, as &s;he gazed within the curtains, the pall moved again, and, in the next moment, the apparition of a human countenance ro&s;e above it.</P>
<P>Screaming with terror, they both fled, and got out of the chamber as fa&s;t as their trembling limbs would bear them, leav|ing open doors of all the rooms, through which they pa&s;&s;ed. When they reached the &s;tairca&s;e, Dorothee threw open a cham|ber door, where &s;ome of the female &s;ervants &s;lept, and &s;unk breathle&s;s on the bed; while Emily, deprived of all pre&s;ence of mind, made only a feeble attempt to conceal the occa&s;ion of her terror from the a&s;toni&s;hed &s;ervants; and, though Dorothee, when &s;he could &s;peak, endeavoured to laugh at her own fright, and was joined by Emily, no remon&s;trances could prevail with the &s;er|vants, who had quickly taken the alarm, to pa&s;s even the remain|der of the night in a room &s;o near to the&s;e terrific chambers.</P>
<P>Dorothee having accompanied Emily to her own apartment, they then began to talk over, with &s;ome degree of coolne&s;s, the &s;trange circum&s;tance, that had ju&s;t occurred; and Emily would almo&s;t have doubted her own perceptions, had not tho&s;e of Dor|othee atte&s;ted their truth. Having now mentioned what &s;he had ob&s;erved in the outer chamber, &s;he a&s;ked the hou&s;ekeeper, whe|ther &s;he was certain no door had been left unfa&s;tened, by which a per&s;on might &s;ecretly have entered the apartments? Dorothee replied, that &s;he had con&s;tantly kept the keys of the &s;everal doors
<PB N="98" REF="029378_0276_0FE086A47A747658">
in her own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that, when &s;he had gone her rounds through the ca&s;tle, as &s;he frequently di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, to examine if all was &s;afe, &s;he had tried the&s;e doors among the re&s;t, and had always found them fa&s;tened. It was, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible, &s;he added, that any per&s;on could have got admittance into the apartments; and, if they could&mdash;it was very improbable they &s;hould have cho&s;e to &s;leep in a place &s;o cold and forlorn.</P>
<P>Emily ob&s;erved, that their vi&s;it to the&s;e chambers had, per|haps, been watched, and that &s;ome per&s;on, for a frolic, had fol|lowed them into the rooms, with a de&s;ign to frighten them, and, while they were in the oriel, had taken the opportunity of con|cealing him&s;elf in the bed.</P>
<P>Dorothee allowed, that this was po&s;&s;ible, till &s;he recollected, that, on entering the apartments, &s;he had turned the key of the outer door, and this, which had been done to prevent their vi&s;it being noticed by any of the family, who might happen to be up, mu&s;t effectually have excluded every per&s;on, except them&s;elves, from the chambers; and &s;he now per&s;i&s;ted in affirming, that the gha&s;tly countenance &s;he had &s;een was nothing human, but &s;ome dreadful apparition.</P>
<P>Emily was very &s;olemnly affected. Of whatever nature might be the appearance &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, whether human or &s;upernat|ural, the fate of the decea&s;ed Marchione&s;s was a truth not to be doubted; and this unaccountable circum&s;tance, occurring in the very &s;cene of her &s;ufferings, affected Emily's imagination with a &s;uper&s;titious awe, to which, after having detected the fallacies at Udolpho, &s;he might not have yielded, had &s;he been ignorant of the unhappy &s;tory, related by the hou&s;ekeeper. Her &s;he now &s;o|lemnly conjured to conceal the occurrence of this night, and to make light of the terror &s;he had already betrayed, that the Count might not be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by reports, which would certainly &s;pread alarm and confu&s;&s;ion among his family. "Time," &s;he added, "may explain this my&s;terious affair; meanwhile let us watch the event in &s;ilence."</P>
<P>Dorothee readily acquie&s;ced; but &s;he now recollected that &s;he had left all the doors of the north &s;uite of rooms open, and, not having courage to return alone to lock even the outer one, Emi|ly, after &s;ome effort &s;o far conquered her own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears, that &s;he of|fered to accompany her to the foot of the back &s;tairca&s;e, and to wait there while Dorothee a&s;cended, who&s;e re&s;olution being re|a&s;&s;ured by this circum&s;tance, &s;he con&s;ented to go, and they left Emily's apartment together.</P>
<P>No &s;ound di&s;turbed the &s;tillne&s;s, as they pa&s;&s;ed along the halls and galleries; but, on reaching the foot of the back &s;tairca&s;e,

Dorothee's re&s;olution failed again; having, however, pau&s;ed a moment to li&s;ten, and no &s;ound being heard above, &s;he a&s;cended, leaving Emily below, and, &s;carcely &s;uffering her eye to glance within the fir&s;t chamber, &s;he fa&s;tened the door, which &s;hut up the whole &s;uite of apartments, and returned to Emily.</P>
<P>As they &s;tepped along the pa&s;&s;age, leading into the great hall, a &s;ound of lamentation was heard, which &s;eemed to come from the hall it&s;elf, and they &s;topped in new alarm to li&s;ten, when Emily, pre&s;ently di&s;tingui&s;hed the voice of Annette, whom &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound cro&s;&s;ing the hall, with another female &s;ervant, and &s;o terri|fied by the report, which the other maids had &s;pread, that, be|lieving &s;he could be &s;afe only where her lady was, &s;he was going for refuge to her apartment.

<P>EMILY's injunctions to Annette to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject of her terror were ineffectual, and the occurrence of the preceding night &s;pread &s;uch alarm among the &s;ervants, who now all affirmed, that they had frequently heard unaccountable noi&s;es in the chateau, that a report &s;oon reached the Count of the north &s;ide of the ca&s;tle be|ing haunted. He treated this, at fir&s;t, with ridicule, but, per|ceiving, that it was productive of &s;erious evil, in the confu&s;ion it occa&s;ioned among his hou&s;ehold, he forbade any per&s;on to repeat it, on pain of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The arrival of a party of his friends &s;oon withdrew his thoughts entirely from this &s;ubject, and his &s;ervants had now
<PB N="100" REF="029378_0277_0FE0880CF42B29E0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lei&s;ure to brood over it, except, indeed, in the evenings after &s;upper, when they all a&s;&s;embled in their hall, and related &s;tories of gho&s;ts, till they feared to look round the room; &s;tart|ed, if the echo of a clo&s;ing door murmured along the pa&s;&s;age, and refu&s;ed to go &s;ingly to any part of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>On the&s;e occa&s;ions Annette made a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure. When &s;he told not only of all the wonders &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, but of all that &s;he had imagined, in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, with the &s;tory of the &s;trange di&s;appearance of Signora Laurentini, &s;he made no trifling impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of her attentive audi|tors. Her &s;u&s;picions, concerning Montoni, &s;he would al&s;o have freely di&s;clo&s;ed, had not Ludovico, who was now in the &s;ervice of the Count, prudently checked her loquacity, whenever it pointed to that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Among the vi&s;itors at the chateau was the Baron de Saint Foix, an old friend of the Count, and his &s;on, the Chevalier St. Foix, a &s;en&s;ible and amiable young man, who, having in the preceding year &s;een the Lady Blanche, at Paris, had become her declared admirer. The friend&s;hip, which the Count had long entertained for his father, and the equality of their cir|cum&s;tances made him &s;ecretly approve of the connection; but, thinking his daughter at this time too young to fix her choice for life, and wi&s;hing to prove the &s;incerity and &s;trength of the Chevalier's attachment, he then rejected his &s;uit, though with|out forbidding his future hope. This young man now came, with the Baron, his father, to claim the reward of a &s;teady af|fection, a claim, which the Count admitted and which Blanche did not reject.</P>
<P>While the&s;e vi&s;itors were at the chateau, it became a &s;cene of gaiety and &s;plendour. The pavilion in the woods was fitted up and frequented, in the fine evenings, as a &s;upper room, when the hour u&s;ually concluded with a concert, at which the Count and Counte&s;s, who were &s;cientific performers, and the Chevaliers Henri and St. Foix, with the Lady Blanche and Emily, who&s;e voices and fine ta&s;te compen&s;ated for the want of more &s;kilful ex|ecution, u&s;ually a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Several of the Count's &s;ervants per|formed on horns and other in&s;truments, &s;ome of which, placed at a little di&s;tance among the woods, &s;poke, in &s;weet re&s;pon&s;e, to the harmony, that proceeded from the pavilion.</P>
<P>At any other period, the&s;e parties would have been delightful to Emily; but her &s;pirits were now oppre&s;&s;ed with a melancho|ly, which &s;he perceived that no kind of what is called amu&s;e|ment had power to di&s;&s;ipate, and which the tender, and, frequent|ly,
<PB N="101" REF="029378_0277_0FE0880CF42B29E0">
pathetic, melody of the&s;e concerts &s;ometimes increa&s;ed to a very painful degree.</P>
<P>She was particularly fond of walking in the woods, that hung on a promontory, overlooking the &s;ea. Their luxuriant &s;hade was &s;oothing to her pen&s;ive mind, and, in the partial views, which they afforded of the Mediterranean, with its winding &s;hores and pa&s;&s;ing &s;ails, tranquil beauty was united with gran|deur. The paths were rude and frequently overgrown with veg|etation, but their ta&s;teful owner would &s;uffer little to be done to them, and &s;carcely a &s;ingle branch to be lopped from the venera|ble trees. On an eminence, in one of the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered parts of the&s;e woods, was a ru&s;tic &s;eat, formed of the trunk of a decay|ed oak, which had once been a noble tree, and of which, many lofty branches &s;till flouri&s;hing united with beech and pines, to overcanopy the &s;pot. Beneath their deep umbrage, the eye pa&s;&s;|ed over the tops of other woods, to the Mediterranean, and to the left, through an opening, was &s;een a ruined watch tower, &s;tanding on a point of rock, near the &s;ea, and ri&s;ing from among the tufted foliage.</P>
<P>Hither Emily often came alone in the &s;ilence of evening, and, &s;oothed by the &s;cenery and by the faint murmur, that ro&s;e from the waves, would &s;it, till darkne&s;s obliged her to return to the chateau. Frequently, al&s;o, &s;he vi&s;ited the watch tower, which commanded the entire pro&s;pect, and, when &s;he leaned again&s;t its broken walls, and thought of Valancourt, &s;he not once imagined, what was &s;o true, that this tower had been almo&s;t as frequently his re&s;ort, as her own, &s;ince his e&s;trangement from the neigh|bouring chateau.</P>
<P>One evening, &s;he lingered here to a late hour. She had &s;at on the &s;teps of the building, watching, in tranquil melancholy, the gradual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ffect of evening over the exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Mediterranean and the ma&s;&s;y woods were al|mo&s;t the only features of the &s;cene, that remained vi&s;ible; when, as &s;he gazed alternately on the&s;e, and on the mild blue of the heavens, where the fir&s;t pale &s;tar of evening appeared, &s;he per&s;on|ified the hour in the following lines:</P>

The moon was now ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea. She watched its gradual progre&s;s, the extending line of radiance it threw upon the waters, the &s;parkling oars, the &s;ail faintly &s;ilvered, and the wood tops and the battlements of the watch tower, at who&s;e foot &s;he was &s;itting, ju&s;t tinted with the rays. Emily's &s;pirits were in harmony with this &s;cene. As &s;he &s;at meditating, &s;ounds &s;tole by her on the air, which &s;he immediately knew to be the mu&s;ic and the voice &s;he had formerly heard at midnight, and the emotion of awe, which &s;he felt, was not unmixed with terror, when &s;he con&s;idered her remote and lonely &s;ituation. The &s;ounds drew nearer. She would have ri&s;en to leave the place, but they &s;eem|ed to come from the way &s;he mu&s;t have taken towards the cha|teau, and &s;he awaited the event in trembling expectation. The &s;ounds continued to approach, for &s;ometime, and then cea&s;ed. Emily &s;at li&s;tening, gazing and unable to move, when &s;he &s;aw a figure emerge from the &s;hade of the woods and pa&s;s along the bank, at &s;ome little di&s;tance before her. It went &s;wiftly, and her &s;pirits were &s;o overcome with awe, that, though &s;he &s;aw, &s;he did not much ob&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Having left the &s;pot, with a re&s;olution never again to vi&s;it it alone, at &s;o late an hour, &s;he began to approach the chateau, when &s;he heard voices calling her from the part of the wood, which was neare&s;t to it. They were the &s;houts of the Count's &s;ervants, who were &s;ent to &s;earch for her; and, when &s;he enter|ed the &s;upper room, where he &s;at with Henri and Blanche, he gently reproached her with a look, which &s;he blu&s;hed to have de&s;erved.</P>
<P>This little occurrence deeply impre&s;&s;ed her mind, and, when &s;he withdrew to her own room, it recalled &s;o forcibly the cir|cum&s;tances &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, a few nights before, that &s;he had &s;carcely courage to remain alone. She watched to a late hour, when, no &s;ound having renewed her fears, &s;he at length &s;unk to repo&s;e. But this was of &s;hort continuance, for &s;he was di&s;turb|ed by a loud and unu&s;ual noi&s;e, that &s;eemed to come from the gallery into which her chamber opened. Groans were di&s;tinctly heard, and immediately after, a dead weight fell again&s;t her door, with a violence, that threatened to bur&s;t it open. She called loudly to know who was there, but received no an&s;wer, though at intervals, &s;he &s;till thought &s;he heard &s;omething like a low moaning. Fear deprived her of the power to move. Soon after, &s;he heard foot&s;teps in a remote part of the gallery, and as they approached, &s;he called more loudly than before, till the &s;teps pau&s;ed at her door. She then di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of

&s;everal of the &s;ervants, who &s;eemed too much engaged by &s;ome circum&s;tance without, to attend to her calls; but, Annette &s;oon after entering the room for water, Emily under&s;tood, that one of the maids had fainted, whom &s;he immediately de&s;ired them to bring into her room, where &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted to re&s;tore her.

It &s;tood for a moment in the corner of the landing place, which &s;he was approaching, and then gliding up the &s;tairs, vani&s;hed at the door of the apartment, that had been lately opened.

that Ludovico proved at once his courage and his gratitude for the kindne&s;s he had received from the Count, by offering to watch, during a night, in the &s;uite of rooms, reputed to be haunted. He feared, he &s;aid, no &s;pirits, and, if any thing of human form appeared&mdash;he would prove that he dreaded that as little.</P>
<P>The Count pau&s;ed upon the offer, while the &s;ervants who heard it looked upon one another in doubt and amazement, and An|nette, terrified for the &s;afety of Ludovico, employed tears and en|treaties to di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"You are a bold fellow," &s;aid the Count, &s;miling, "Think well of what you are going to encounter, before you finally de|termine upon it. However, if you per&s;evere in your re&s;olution, I will accept your offer, and your intrepidity &s;hall not go unre|warded."</P>
<P>"I de&s;ire no reward, your <HI>Excellenza,"</HI> replied Ludovico, "but your approbation. Your <HI>Excellenza</HI> has been &s;ufficiently good to me already; but I wi&s;h to have arms, that I may be equal to my enemy, if he &s;hould appear."</P>
<P>"Your &s;word cannot defend you again&s;t a gho&s;t," replied the Count, throwing a glance of irony upon the other &s;ervants, "neither can bars, or bolts; for a &s;pirit you know, can glide through a key hole, as ea&s;ily as through a door."</P>
<P>"Give me a &s;word, my lord Count," &s;aid Ludovico, "and I will lay all the &s;pirits, that &s;hall attack me, in the red &s;ea."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid the Count, "you &s;hall have a &s;word and good cheer, too; and your brave comrades here will, perhaps, have courage enough to remain another night in the chateau, &s;ince your boldne&s;s will certainly, for this night, at lea&s;t, confine all the malice of the &s;pectre to your&s;elf."</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity now &s;truggled with fear in the minds of &s;everal of his fellow &s;ervants, and, at length, they re&s;olved to await the event of Ludovico's ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed and concerned, when &s;he heard of his in|tention, and was frequently inclined to mention what &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed in the north apartments to the Count, for &s;he could not entirely dive&s;t her&s;elf of fears for Ludovico's &s;afety, though her rea&s;on repre&s;ented the&s;e to be ab&s;urd.

<P>THE Count gave orders for the north apartments to be op|ened and prepared for the reception of Ludovico; but Dorothee, remembering what &s;he had lately witne&s;&s;ed there, feared to obey, and, not one of the other &s;ervants daring to venture thither, the rooms remained &s;hut up till the time when Ludovico was to re|tire thither for the night, an hour, for which the whole hou&s;e|hold waited with impatience.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, Ludovico by the order of the Count, attended him in his clo&s;et, where they remained alone for near half an hour, and, on leaving which, his lord delivered to him a &s;word.</P>
<P>"It has &s;een &s;ervice in mortal quarrels," &s;aid the Count, jo|co&s;ely, "you will u&s;e it honourably, no doubt, in a &s;piritual one. To morrow, let me hear that there is not one gho&s;t remaining in the chateau."</P>
<P>Ludovico received it with a re&s;pectful bow. "You &s;hall be obeyed, my Lord," &s;aid he, "I will engage, that no &s;pectre &s;hall di&s;turb the peace of the chateau after this night."</P>
<P>They now returned to the &s;upper room, where the Count gue&s;ts awaited to accompany him and Ludovico to the door <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the north apartments, and Dorothee being &s;ummoned for the keys, delivered them to Ludovico, who then led the way, fol|lowed by mo&s;t of the inhabitants of the chateau. Having reached the back &s;tairca&s;e, &s;everal of the &s;ervants &s;hrunk back, and refu&s;ed to go further, but the re&s;t followed him to the top of the &s;tairca&s;e, where a broad landing place allowed them to flock round him, while he applied the key to the door, during which they watched him with as much eager curio&s;ity as if he had been performing &s;ome magical rite.</P>
<P>Ludovico, unaccu&s;tomed to the lock, could not turn it, and Dorothee, who had lingered far behind, was called forward, un|der

who&s;e hand the door opened &s;lowly, and her eye glancing within the du&s;ky chamber, &s;he uttered a &s;udden &s;hriek, and re|treated. At this &s;ignal of alarm, the greater part of the crowd hurried down the &s;tairs, and the Count, Henri and Ludovico were left alone to pur&s;ue the inquiry, who in&s;tantly ru&s;hed into the apartment, Ludovico with a drawn &s;word, which he had ju&s;t time to draw from the &s;cabbard, the Count with the lamp in his hand, and Henri carrying a ba&s;ket, containing provi&s;ion for the courageous adventurer.</P>
<P>Having looked ha&s;tily round the fir&s;t room, where nothing appeared to ju&s;tify alarm, they pa&s;&s;ed on to the &s;econd; and here too all being quiet, they proceeded to a third in a more tempered &s;tep. The Count had now lei&s;ure to &s;mile at the di&s;|compo&s;ure, into which he had been &s;urpri&s;ed, and to a&s;k Ludov|ico in which room he de&s;igned to pa&s;s the night.</P>
<P>"There are &s;everal chambers beyond the&s;e, your <HI>Excellenza,"</HI> &s;aid Ludovico, pointing to a door, "and in one of them is a bed, they &s;ay. I will pa&s;s the night there, and when I am weary of watching, I can lie down."</P>
<P>"Good;" &s;aid the Count, "let us go on. You &s;ee the&s;e rooms &s;hew nothing, but damp walls and decaying furniture. I have been &s;o much engaged &s;ince I came to the chateau, that I have not looked into them till now. Remember, Ludovico, to tell the hou&s;ekeeper, to morrow to throw open the&s;e windows. The dama&s;k hangings are dropping to pieces, I will have them taken down, and this antique furniture removed."</P>
<P>"Dear &s;ir!" &s;aid Henri, "here is an arm chair &s;o ma&s;&s;y with gilding, that it re&s;embles one of the &s;tate chairs at the Louvre, more than any thing el&s;e."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid the Count, &s;topping a moment to &s;urvey it, "There is a hi&s;tory belonging to that chair, but I have not time to tell it.&mdash;Let us pa&s;s on. This &s;uite runs to a greater extent than I had imagined; It is many years &s;ince I was in them. But where is the bed room you &s;peak of, Ludovico?&mdash;the&s;e are on|ly anti chambers to the great drawing room. I remember them in their &s;plendour!"</P>
<P>"The bed, my Lord," replied Ludovico, "they told me, was in a room that opens beyond the &s;aloon, and terminates the &s;uite."</P>
<P>"O, here is the &s;aloon," &s;aid the Count, as they entered the &s;pacious apartment, in which Emily and Dorothee had re&s;ted. He here &s;tood for a moment, &s;urveying the reliques of faded gran|deur, which it exhibited&mdash;the &s;umptuous tape&s;try&mdash;the long and low &s;ophas of velvet, with frames heavily carved and gilded&mdash;the
<PB N="108" REF="029378_0281_0FE086C7F0F3C0E8">
floor inlaid with &s;mall &s;quares of fine marble, and covered in the centre with a piece of very rich tape&s;try work&mdash;the ca&s;e|ments of painted gla&s;s, and the large Venetian mirrors of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and quality, &s;uch as at that period France could not make, which reflected, on every &s;ide, the &s;pacious apartment. The&s;e had formerly al&s;o reflected a gay and brilliant &s;cene, for this had been the &s;tate room of the chateau, and here the Marchione&s;s had held the a&s;&s;emblies, that made part of the fe&s;tivities of her nuptials. If the wand of a magician could have recalled the vani&s;hed groups, many of them vani&s;hed even from the the earth! that once had pa&s;&s;ed over the&s;e poli&s;hed mirrors, what a varied and contra&s;ted picture would they have exhibited with the pre&s;ent! Now, in&s;tead of a blaze of lights, and a &s;plen|did and bu&s;y crowd, they reflected only the rays of the one glimmering lamp, which the Count held up, and which &s;carcely &s;erved to &s;hew the three forlorn figures, that &s;tood &s;urveying the room, and the &s;pacious and du&s;ky walls around them.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid the Count to Henri, awaking from his deep re|verie, "how the &s;cene is changed &s;ince la&s;t I &s;aw it! I was a young man, then, and the Marchione&s;s was alive and in her bloom; many other per&s;ons were here, too, who are now no more! There &s;tood the orche&s;try; here we tripped in many a &s;prightly maze&mdash;the walls echoing to the dance! Now they re&s;ound only one feeble voice&mdash;and even that will, ere long be heard no more! My &s;on, remember, that I was once as young as your&s;elf, and that you mu&s;t pa&s;s away like tho&s;e, who have pre|ceded you&mdash;like tho&s;e, who, as they &s;ung and danced in this once gay apartment, forgot that years are made up of mo|ments, and that every &s;tep they took carried them nearer to their graves. But &s;uch reflections are u&s;ele&s;s, I had almo&s;t &s;aid crim|inal, unle&s;s they teach us to prepare for eternity, &s;ince, otherwi&s;e they cloud our pre&s;ent happine&s;s, without guiding us to a future one. But enough of this; let us go on."</P>
<P>Ludovico now opened the door of the bed room, and the Count, as he entered, was &s;truck with the funeral appearance, which the dark arras gave to it. He approached the bed, with an emo|tion of &s;olemnity, and, perceiving it to be covered with the pall of black velvet, pau&s;ed; "what can this mean?" &s;aid he, as he gazed upon it.</P>
<P>"I have heard, my Lord," &s;aid Ludovico, as he &s;tood at the feet, looking within the canopied curtains, "that the Lady Mar|chione&s;s de Villeroi died in this chamber, and remained here till &s;he was removed to be buried; and this, perhaps, Signor, may account for the pall."</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="029378_0281_0FE086C7F0F3C0E8">
The Count made no reply, but &s;tood for a few moments en|gaged in thought, and evidently much affected. They turning to Ludovico, he a&s;ked him with a &s;erious air, whether he thought his courage would &s;upport him through the night? "If you doubt this," added the Count, "do not be a&s;hamed to own it; I will relea&s;e you from your engagement, without expo&s;ing you to the triumphs of your fellow &s;ervants."</P>
<P>Ludovico pau&s;ed; pride, and &s;omething very like fear, &s;eem|ed &s;truggling in his brea&s;t; pride, however, was victorious; he blu&s;hed, and his he&s;itation cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"No, my Lord," &s;aid he, "I will go through with what I have begun; and I am grateful for your con&s;ideration. On that hearth I will make a fire, and, with the good cheer in this ba&s;|ket, I doubt not I &s;hall do well."</P>
<P>"Be it &s;o," &s;aid the Count; "but how will you beguile the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the night, if you do not &s;leep?</P>
<P>"When I am weary, my Lord," replied Ludovico, "I &s;hall not fear to &s;leep; in the meanwhile I have a book, that will en|tertain me."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid the Count, "I hope nothing will di&s;turb you; but if you &s;hould be &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed in the night, come to my apartment. I have too much confidence in your good &s;en&s;e and courage, to believe you will be alarmed on &s;light grounds; or &s;uffer the gloom of this chamber, or its remote &s;ituation, to over|come you with ideal terrors. To morrow, I &s;hall have to thank you for an important &s;ervice; the&s;e rooms &s;hall then be thrown open, and my people will be convinced of their error. Good night, Ludovico; let me &s;ee you early in the morning, and re|member what I lately &s;aid to you."</P>
<P>"I will, my Lord; good night to your <HI>Excellenza;</HI> let me attend you with the light."</P>
<P>He lighted the Count and Henri through the chambers to the outer door; on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> place &s;tood a lamp, which one of the affrighted &s;ervants had left, and Henri, as he took it up, again bade Ludovico good night, who, having re&s;pectfully re|turned the wi&s;h, clo&s;ed the door upon them, and fa&s;tened it. Then, as he retired to the bed chamber, he examined the rooms, through which he pa&s;&s;ed, with more minutene&s;s than he had done before, for he apprehended, that &s;ome per&s;on might have concealed him&s;elf in them, for the purpo&s;e of frightening him. No one, however, but him&s;elf, was in the&s;e chambers, and, leav|ing open the doors, through which he pa&s;&s;ed, he came again to
<PB N="110" REF="029378_0282_0FE086D56F49D5C0">
the great drawing room, who&s;e &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ilent gloom &s;omewhat awed him. For a moment he &s;tood, looking back through the long &s;uite of rooms he had quitted, and, as he turn|ed, perceiving a light and his own figure, reflected in one of the large mirrors, he &s;tarted. Other objects too were &s;een ob&s;curely on its dark &s;urface, but he pau&s;ed not to examine them, and re|turned ha&s;tily into the bed room, as he &s;urveyed which, he ob|&s;erved the door of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and opened it. All within was &s;till. On looking round, his eye was arre&s;ted by the portrait of the decea&s;ed Marchione&s;s, upon which he gazed, for a con&s;iderable time, with great attention and &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; and then, having examined the clo&s;et, he returned into the bed room, where he kindled a wood fire, the bright blaze of which revived his &s;pi|rits, which had began to yield to the gloom and &s;ilence of the place, for gu&s;ts of wind alone broke at intervals this &s;ilence. He now drew a &s;mall table and a chair near the fire, took a bottle of wine, and &s;ome cold provi&s;ion out of his ba&s;ket, and regaled him&s;elf. When he had fini&s;hed his repa&s;t, he &s;aid his &s;word up|on the table, and, not feeling di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep, drew from his pocket the book he had &s;poken of. It was a volume of old Provencal tales. Having &s;tirred the fire into a brighter blaze, trimmed his lamp, and drawn his chair upon the hearth, he be|gan to read, and his attention was &s;oon wholly occupied by the &s;cenes, which the page di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, had returned to the &s;upper room, whither tho&s;e of the party, who had attended him to the north apartment, had retreated, upon hearing Dorothee's &s;cream, and who were now earne&s;t in their inquiries concerning tho&s;e cham|bers. The Count rallied his gue&s;ts on their precipitate retreat, and on the &s;uper&s;titious inclination which had occa&s;ioned it, and this led to the que&s;tion, Whether the &s;pirit, after it has quitted the body, is ever permitted to revi&s;it the earth; and if it is, whether it was po&s;&s;ible for &s;pirits to become vi&s;ible to the &s;en&s;e. The Baron was of opinion, that the fir&s;t was probable, and the la&s;t was po&s;&s;ible, and he endeavoured to ju&s;tify this opinion by re&s;pectable authorities, both moment and modern, which he quot|ed. The Count, however, was decidedly again&s;t him, and a long conver&s;ation en&s;ued, in which the u&s;ual arguments on the&s;e &s;ub|jects were on both &s;ides brought forward with &s;kill, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with candour, but without converting either party to the opin|ion of his opponent. The effect of their conver&s;ation on their auditors was various. Though the Count had much the &s;uperi|ority of the Bavon in point of argument, he had con&s;iderably
<PB N="111" REF="029378_0282_0FE086D56F49D5C0">
fewer adherents; for that love, &s;o natural to the human mind, of whatever is able to di&s;tend its faculties with wonder and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, attached the majority of the company to the &s;ide of the Baron; and, though many of the Count's propo&s;itions were un|an&s;werable, his opponents were inclined to believe this the con|&s;equence of their own want of knowledge, on &s;o ab&s;tracted a &s;ubject, rather than that arguments did not exi&s;t, which were forcible enough to conquer his.</P>
<P>Blanche was pale with attention, till the ridicule in her father's glance called a blu&s;h upon her countenance, and &s;he then endea|voured to forget the &s;uper&s;titious tales &s;he had been told in her convent. Meanwhile, Emily had been li&s;tening with deep at|tention to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of what was to her a very intere&s;ting que&s;tion, and, remembering the appearance &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed in the apartment of the late Marchione&s;s, &s;he was frequently chill|ed with awe. Several times &s;he was on the point of mentioning what &s;he had &s;een, but the fear of giving pain to the Count, and the dread of his ridicule, re&s;trained her; and, awaiting in an|xious expectation the event of Ludovico's intrepidity, &s;he deter|mined that her future &s;ilence &s;hould depend upon it.</P>
<P>When the party had &s;eparated for the night, and the Count retired to his dre&s;&s;ing room, the remembrance of the de&s;olate &s;cenes he had lately witne&s;&s;ed in his own man&s;ion deeply affected him, but at length he was arou&s;ed from his reverie and his &s;i|lence. "What mu&s;ic is that I hear?" &s;aid he &s;uddenly to his valet, "Who plays at this late hour?"</P>
<P>The man made no reply, and the Count continued to li&s;ten, and then added, "That is no common mu&s;ician; be touches the in&s;trument with a delicate hand; who is it Pierre?"</P>
<P>"My Lord!" &s;aid the man, he&s;itatingly.</P>
<P>"Who plays that in&s;trument?" repeated the Count.</P>
<P>"Does not your lord&s;hip know, then!" &s;aid the valet.</P>
<P>"What mean you?" &s;aid the Count, &s;omewhat &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"Nothing, my Lord, I meant nothing," rejoined the man &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively&mdash;"Only&mdash;that mu&s;ic&mdash;goes about the hou&s;e at midnight often, and I thought your lord&s;hip might have heard it before."</P>
<P>"Mu&s;ic goes about the hou&s;e at midnight! Poor fellow!&mdash;does nobody dance to the mu&s;ic, too?"</P>
<P>"It is not in the chateau, I believe, my Lord; the &s;ounds come from the woods, they &s;ay, though they &s;eem &s;o near; but then a &s;pirit can do any thing!"</P>
<P>"Ah, poor follow!" &s;aid the Count, "I perceive you are as

filly as the re&s;t of them; to morrow, you will be convinced of your ridiculous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> But hark!&mdash;what voice is that?"</P>
<P>"O my Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> voice we often hear with the mu&s;ic."</P>
<P>"Often!" &s;aid the Count, "How often, pray? It is a very fine one."</P>
<P>"Why, my Lord, I my&s;elf have not heard it more than two or three times, but there are tho&s;e who have lived here longer that have heard it often enough."</P>
<P>"What a &s;well was that!" exclaimed the Count, as he &s;till li&s;tened, "And now, what a dying cadence! This is &s;urely &s;omething more than mortal!"</P>
<P>"That is what they &s;ay&punc; my Lord," &s;aid the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: "they &s;ay it is nothing mortal, that utters it; and if I might &s;ay my thoughts"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Peace!" &s;aid the Count, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> li&s;tened till the &s;train <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> away.</P>
<P>"This is &s;trange!" &s;aid he, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the window, "Clo&s;e the ca&s;ements, Pierre."</P>
<P>Pierre obeyed, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oon after di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, but did not &s;o &s;oon lo&s;e the remembrance of the mu&s;ic, which long, vibrated in his fancy in tones of melting &s;weetne&s;s, while &s;ur|pri&s;e and perplexity engaged his thoughts.</P>
<P>Ludovico, meanwhile, in his remote chamber, heard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and then, the faint echo of a clo&s;ing door, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the family retired to re&s;t, and then the hall clock, at a great di&s;tance, &s;trike twelve. "It is midnight," &s;aid he, and he looked &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly round the &s;pacious chamber. The fire on the hearth was now nearly ex|piring, for his attention having been engaged by the book before him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he had forgotten every thing be&s;ides; but he &s;oon added fre&s;h wood, not becau&s;e he was cold, though the night was &s;tormy, out becau&s;e he was cheerle&s;s; and, having again trimmed his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">amp, he poured out a gla&s;s of wine, drew his chair nearer to the crackling blaze, tried to be deaf to the wind, that howled mournfully at the ca&s;ements, endeavoured to ab&s;tract his mind from the melancholy that was &s;tealing upon him, and again took up his book. It had been lent to him by Dorothee, who had formerly picked it up in an ob&s;cure corner of the Marquis's li|brary, and who having opened it and perceived &s;ome of the mar|vels it related, had carefully pre&s;erved it for her own entertain|ment, its condition giving her &s;ome excu&s;e for detaining it from its proper &s;tation. The damp corner into which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had fallen, had cau&s;ed the cover to be disfigured and mouldy, and the leave to be &s;o di&s;coloured with &s;pots, that it was not without difficulty
<PB N="113" REF="029378_0283_0FE086DA07F7F290">
the letters could be traced. The fictions of the Provencal wri|ters, whether drawn from the Arabian legends, brought by the Saracens into Spain, or recounting the chivalric exploits perform|ed by the cru&s;aders, whom the Troubadours accompanied to the ca&s;t, were generally &s;plendid and always marvellous, both in &s;cen|ery and incident; and it is not wonderful, that Dorothee, and Ludovico &s;hould be fa&s;cinated by inventions, which had capti|vated the carele&s;s imagination in every rank of &s;ociety, in a for|mer age. Some of the tales, however, in the book now before Ludovico, were of &s;imple &s;tructure, and exhibited nothing of the magnificent machinery and heroic manners, which u&s;ually charac|teri&s;ed the fables of the twelfth century, and of this de&s;cription was the one he now happened to open, which, in its original &s;tyle, was of great length, but which may be thus &s;hortly related. The reader will perceive, that it is &s;trongly tinctured with the &s;uper&s;tition of the times.</P>

His ca&s;tle was graced with ladies of exqui&s;ite beauty, and thronged with illu&s;trious knights; for the honours he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to feats of chivalry invited the brave of di&s;tant countries to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his li&s;ts, and his court was more &s;plendid than tho&s;e of many princes. Eight min&s;trels were retained in his &s;ervice, who u&s;ed to &s;ing to their harps ro|mantic fictions, taken from the Arabians, or adventures of chi|valry, that befe' knights during the cru&s;ades, or the martial deeds of the Baron, their lord; while he, &s;urrounded by his knights and ladies, banqueted in the great hall of his ca&s;tle, where the co&s;tly tape&s;try, that adorned the walls with pictured exploits of his ance&s;tors, the ca&s;ements of painted gla&s;s, enriched with ar|morial bearings, the gorgeous banners that waved along the roof, the &s;umptuous canopies, the profu&s;ion of gold and &s;ilver that glit|tered on the &s;ideboards, the numerous di&s;hes, that covered the tables, the number and gay liveries of the attendants, with the chivalric and &s;plended attire of the gue&s;ts, united to form a &s;cene of magnificence, &s;uch as we may not hope to &s;ee in the&s;e <HI>degen|erate days.</HI></P>
<P>"Of the Baron, the following adventure is related. One night having retired late from the banquet to his chamber, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his attendants, he was &s;urpri&s;ed by the appearance of a &s;tranger of a noble air, but of a &s;orrowful and dejected counte|nance.
<PB N="114" REF="029378_0284_0FE086E79608A000">
Believing, that this per&s;on had been &s;ecreted in the apart|ment, &s;ince it appeared impo&s;&s;ible he could have lately pa&s;&s;ed the anti room, unob&s;erved by the pages in waiting, who would have prevented this intru&s;ion on their lord, the Baron, calling loudly for his people, drew his &s;word, which he had not yet taken from his &s;ide, and &s;tood upon his defence. The &s;tranger &s;lowly ad|vancing, told him, that there was nothing to fear; that he came with no ho&s;tile de&s;ign, but to communicate to him a terrible &s;e|cret, which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to know.</P>
<P>"The Baron, appea&s;ed by the courteous manners of the &s;tran|ger, after &s;urveying him, for &s;ometime, in &s;ilence, returned his &s;word into the &s;cabbard, and de&s;ired him to explain the means, by which he had obtained acce&s;s to the chamber, and the pur|po&s;e of this extraordinary vi&s;it.</P>
<P>"Without an&s;wering either of the&s;e inquiries, the &s;tranger &s;aid, that he could not then explain him&s;elf, but that, if the Ba|ron would follow him to the edge of the fore&s;t, at a &s;hort di&s;|tance from the ca&s;tle walls, he would there convince him, that he had &s;omething of importance to di&s;clo&s;e.</P>
<P>"This propo&s;al again alarmed the Baron, who could &s;carcely believe, that the &s;tranger meant to draw him to &s;o &s;olitary a &s;pot, at this hour of the night, without harbouring a de&s;ign again&s;t his life, and he refu&s;ed to go, ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that, if the &s;tranger's purpo&s;e was an honourable one, he would not per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing to reveal the occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it, in the apart|ment where they were.</P>
<P>"While he &s;poke this, he viewed the &s;tranger &s;till more at|tentively than before, but ob&s;erved no change in his countenance, or any &s;ymptom, that might intimate a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of evil de|&s;ign. He was habited like a knight, was of a tall and maje&s;tic &s;tature, and of dignified and courteous manners. Still, howev|er, he refu&s;ed to communicate the &s;ubject of his errand in any place, but that he had mentioned, and, at the &s;ame time, gave hints concerning the &s;ecret he would di&s;clo&s;e, that awakened a degree of &s;olemn curio&s;ity in the Baron, which at length induced him to con&s;ent to follow the &s;tranger, on certain conditions.</P>
<P>"Sir knight," &s;aid he, "I will attend you to the fore&s;t, and will take with me only four of my people, who &s;hall witne&s;s our conference."</P>
<P>To this, however, the Knight objected.</P>
<P>"What I would di&s;clo&s;e," &s;aid he, with &s;olemnity, "is to you alone. There are only three living per&s;ons to whom the circum&s;tance is known; it is of more con&s;equence to you and
<PB N="115" REF="029378_0284_0FE086E79608A000">
your hou&s;e, than I &s;hall now explain. In future years, you will look back to this night with &s;atisfaction or repentance, accord|ingly as you now determine. As you would hereafter pro&s;per&mdash;follow me; I pledge you the honour of a knight, that no evil &s;hall befall you;&mdash;if you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to dare futurity&mdash;remain in your chamber, and I will depart as I came."</P>
<P>"Sir knight," replied the Baron, "how is it po&s;&s;ible, that my future peace can depend upon my pre&s;ent determination?"</P>
<P>"That is not now to be told," &s;aid the &s;tranger, "I have ex|plained my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t. It is late; if you follow me it mu&s;t be quickly;&mdash;you will do well to con&s;ider the alternative."</P>
<P>"The Baron mu&s;ed, and, as he looked upon the knight, he perceived his countenance a&s;&s;ume a &s;ingular &s;olemnity."</P>
<P>[Here Ludovico thought he heard a noi&s;e, and he threw a glance round the chamber, and then held up the lamp to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ob&s;ervation; but not perceiving any thing to confirm his alarm, he took up the book again and pur&s;ued the &s;tory.]</P>
<P>"The Baron paced his apartment, for &s;ometime, impre&s;&s;ed by the la&s;t words of the &s;tranger, who&s;e extraordinary reque&s;t he feared to grant, and feared al&s;o to refu&s;e. At length, he &s;aid, "Sir knight, you are utterly unknown to me; tell me your&s;elf, is it rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould tru&s;t my&s;elf alone with a &s;tranger, at this hour, in a &s;olitary fore&s;t? Tell me, at lea&s;t, who you are, and who a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ecret you in this chamber."</P>
<P>"The knight frowned at the&s;e latter words, and was a mo|ment &s;ilent; then, with a countenance &s;omewhat &s;tern, he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"I am an Engli&s;h knight; I am called Sir Bevys of Lan|ca&s;ter,&mdash;and my deeds are not unknown at the Holy City, whence I was returning to my native land, when I was benighted in the neighbouring fore&s;t."</P>
<P>"Your name is not unknown to fame," &s;aid the Baron, "I have heard of it." (The Knight looked haughtily.) "But why, &s;ince my ca&s;tle is known to entertain all true knights, did not your herald announce you? Why did you not appear at the banquet, where your pre&s;ence would have been welcomed, in&s;tead of hiding your&s;elf in my ca&s;tle and &s;tealing to my chamber, at midnight?"</P>
<P>"The &s;tranger frowned, and turned away in &s;ilence; but the Baron repeated the que&s;tions.</P>
<P>"I come not," &s;aid the Knight, "to an&s;wer inquiries, but to reveal facts. If you would know more, follow me, and again I pledge the honour of a Knight, that you &s;hall return in &s;afety.&mdash;Be quick in your determination&mdash;I mu&s;t be gone."</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="029378_0285_0FE086EC29D5A3F8">
"After &s;ome further he&s;itation, the Baron determined to follow the &s;tranger, and to &s;ee the re&s;ult of his extraordinary reque&s;t; he, therefore, again drew forth his &s;word, and, taking up a lamp, bade the Knight lead on. The latter obeyed, and opening the door of the chamber they pa&s;&s;ed into the anti room, where the Baron, &s;urpri&s;ed to find all his pages a&s;leep, &s;topped, and, with ha&s;ty vio|lence, was going to reprimand them for their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, when the Knight waved his hand, and looked &s;o expre&s;&s;ively upon the Baron, that the latter re&s;trained his re&s;entment, and pa&s;&s;ed on.</P>
<P>"The Knight, having de&s;cended a &s;tairca&s;e, opened a &s;ecret door, which the Baron had believed was known only to him&s;elf, and, proceeding through &s;everal narrow and winding pa&s;&s;ages, came, at length, to a &s;mall gate, that opened beyond the walls of the ca&s;tle. Meanwhile, the Baron followed in &s;ilence and amazement, on perceiving that the&s;e &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ages were &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> known to a &s;tranger, and felt inclined to return from an adven|ture, that appeared to partake of treachery, as well as danger. Then con&s;idering that he was armed, and ob&s;erving the courteous and noble air of his conductor, his courage returned, he blu&s;hed, that it had failed him for a moment, and he re&s;olved to trace the my&s;tery to its &s;ource. "He now found him&s;elf on the heathy platform, before his ca&s;tle, where, looking up, he perceived lights glimmering in the different ca&s;ements of the gue&s;ts, who were retiring to &s;leep; and while he &s;hivered in the bla&s;t, and looked on the dark and de&s;olate &s;cene around him, he thought of the comforts of his warm chamber, rendered cheerful by the bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of wood, and felt, for a moment, the full contra&s;t of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation."</P>
<P>[Here Ludovico pau&s;ed a moment, and looking at his own fire, gave it a brightening &s;tir.]</P>
<P>"The wind was &s;trong, and the Baron watched his lamp with anxiety, expecting every moment to &s;ee it extingui&s;hed; but, though the flame wavered, it did not expire, and he &s;till followed the &s;tranger, who often &s;ighed as he went, but did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>"When they reached the borders of the fore&s;t, the Knight turned, and rai&s;ed his head, as if he meant to addre&s;s the Baron, but then, clo&s;ing his lips in &s;ilence, he walked on.</P>
<P>"As they entered, beneath the dark and &s;preading boughs, the Baron, affected by the &s;olemnity of the &s;cene, he&s;itated whether to proceed, and demanded how much further they were to go. The Knight replied only by a ge&s;ture, and the Baron, with he&s;itating &s;teps and a &s;u&s;picious eye, followed through an
<PB N="117" REF="029378_0285_0FE086EC29D5A3F8">
ob&s;cure and intricate path, till, having proceeded a con&s;iderable way, he again demanded whither they were going, and refu&s;ed to proceed unle&s;s he was informed.</P>
<P>"As he &s;aid this, he looked at his own &s;word, and at the Knight alternately, who &s;hook his head, and who&s;e dejected countenance di&s;armed the Baron, for a moment, of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>"A little further is the place, whither I would lead you," &s;aid the &s;tranger; "no evil &s;hall befall you&mdash;I have &s;worn it on the honour of a Knight."</P>
<P>"The Baron, rea&s;&s;ured, again followed in &s;ilence, and they &s;oon arrived at a deep rece&s;s of the fore&s;t, where the dark and lofty che&s;nuts entirely excluded the &s;ky, and which was &s;o overgrown with underwood, that they proceeded with difficulty. The Knight &s;ighed deeply as he pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes pau&s;ed; and having, at length, reached a &s;pot, where the trees crowded into a knot, he turned and, with a terrific look, pointing to the ground, the Baron &s;aw there the body of a man, &s;tretched at its length, and weltering in blood; a gha&s;tly wound was on the forehead, and death appear|ed already to have contracted the features.</P>
<P>"The Baron, on perceiving the &s;pectacle, &s;tarted in horror, looked at the Knight for explanation, and was then going to rai&s;e the body and examine if there were yet any remains of life; but the &s;tranger, waving his hand, fixed upon him a look &s;o ear|ne&s;t and mournful, as not only much &s;urpri&s;ed him, but made him de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>"But, what were the Baron's emotions, when, on holding the lamp near the features of the corp&s;e, he di&s;covered the exact re&s;emblance of the &s;tranger his conductor, to whom he now look|ed up in a&s;toni&s;hment and inquiry? As he gazed, he perceived the countenance of the Knight change, and begin to fade, till his whole form gradually vani&s;hed from his a&s;toni&s;hed &s;en&s;e! While the Baron &s;tood, fixed to the &s;pot, a voice was heard to utter the&s;e words:&mdash;"</P>
<P>[Ludovico &s;tarted, and laid down the book, for he thought he heard a voice in the chamber, and he looked toward the bed, where, however, he &s;aw only the dark curtains and the pall. He li&s;tened, &s;carcely daring to draw his breath, but heard only the di&s;tant roaring of the &s;ea in the &s;torm, and the bla&s;t, that ru&s;hed by the ca&s;ements; when, concluding, that he had been deceived by its &s;ighings, he took up his book to fini&s;h the &s;tory.]</P>

"The body of Sir Bevys of Lanca&s;ter, a noble knight of Eng|land, lies before you. He was, this night, way laid and murder|ed, as he journeyed from the Holy City towards his native land.

<P>"The Baron, when he recovered from the awe and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, into which this adventure had thrown him, returned to his ca&s;tle, whither he cau&s;ed the body of Sir Bevys to be remov|ed; and, on the following day, it was interred, with the honours of knighthood, in the chapel of the ca&s;tle, attended by all the no|ble knights and ladies, who graced the court of the Baron de Brunne."</P>

<P>Ludovico having fini&s;hed this &s;tory, laid a&s;ide the book, for he felt drow&s;y, and, after putting more wood on the fire and taking another gla&s;s of wine, he repo&s;ed him&s;elf in the arm chair on the hearth. In his dream he &s;till beheld the chamber where he really was, and, once or twice, &s;tarted from imperfect &s;lum|bers, imagining he &s;aw a man's face, looking over the high back of his arm chair. This idea had &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed him, that, when he rai&s;ed his eyes, he almo&s;t expected to meet other eyes, fixed upon his own, and he quitted his &s;eat and looked behind the chair, before he felt perfectly convinced, that no per&s;on was there.&mdash;Thus clo&s;ed the hour.</P>

<P>THE Count, who had &s;lept little during the night, ro&s;e early, and, anxious to &s;peak with Ludovico, went to the north apart|ment; but, the outer door having been fa&s;tened, on the preced|ing night, he was obliged to knock loudly for admittance. Neither the knocking, or his voice was heard; but, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the di&s;tance of this door from the bed room, and that Ludovico, wearied with watching, had probably fallen into a deep &s;leep, the Count was not &s;urpri&s;ed on receiving no an&s;wer, and, leav|ing the door, he went down to walk in his grounds.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="029378_0286_0FE086F89F493B48">
It was a gray autumnal morning. The &s;un, ri&s;ing over Pro|vence, gave only a feeble light, as his rays &s;truggled through the vapours that a&s;cended from the &s;ea, and floated heavily over the wood tops, which were now varied with many a mellow tint of autumn. The &s;torm was pa&s;&s;ed, but the waves were yet vio|lently agitated, and their cour&s;e was traced by long lines of foam, while not a breeze fluttered in the &s;ails of the ve&s;&s;els, near the &s;hore, that were weighing anchor to depart. The &s;till gloom of the hour was plea&s;ing to the Count, and he pur&s;ued his way through the woods, &s;unk in deep thought.</P>
<P>Emily al&s;o ro&s;e at an early hour, and took her cu&s;tomary walk along the brow of the promontory, that overhung the Mediterra|nean. Her mind was now not occupied with the occurrences of the chateau, and Valancourt was the &s;ubject of her mournful thoughts; whom &s;he had not yet taught her&s;elf to con&s;ider with indifference, though her judgment con&s;tantly reproached her for the affection, that lingered in her heart, after her e&s;teem for him was departed. Remembrance frequently gave her his parting look and the tones of his voice, when he had bade her a la&s;t fare|wel; and, &s;ome accidental a&s;&s;ociations now recalling the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances to her fancy, with peculiar energy, &s;he &s;hed bitter tears to the recollection.</P>
<P>Having reached the watch tower, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on the broken &s;teps, and, in melancholy dejection, watched the waves, half hid in vapour, as they came rolling towards the &s;hore, and threw up their light &s;pray round the rocks below. Their hol|low murmur and the ob&s;curing mi&s;ts, that came in wreaths up the cliffs, gave a &s;olemnity to the &s;cene, which was in harmony with the temper of her mind, and &s;he &s;at, given up to the re|membrance of pa&s;t times, till this became too painful, and &s;he abruptly quitted the place. On pa&s;&s;ing the little gate of the watch tower, &s;he ob&s;erved letters, engraved on the &s;tone po&s;tern, which &s;he pau&s;ed to examine, and, though they appeared to have been rudely cut with a penknife, the characters were familiar to her; at length, recognizing the hand writing of Valancourt, &s;he read, with trembling anxiety, the following lines, entitled</P>

<P>From the&s;e lines it appeare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, that Valancourt had vi&s;ited the tower; that he had probably been here on the preceding night, for it was &s;uch an one as they de&s;cribed, and that he had left the building very lately, &s;ince it had not long been light, and without light it was impo&s;&s;ible the&s;e letters could have been cut. It was thus even probable, that he might be yet in the gardens.</P>
<P>As the&s;e reflections pa&s;&s;ed rapidly over the mind of Emily, they called up a variety of contending emotions, that almo&s;t overcame her &s;pirits; but her fir&s;t impul&s;e was to avoid him, and, imme|diately leaving the tower, &s;he returned, with ha&s;ty &s;teps, towards the chateau. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along, &s;he remembered the mu&s;ic &s;he had lately heard near the tower, with the figure, which had ap|peared, and, in this moment of agitation, &s;he was inclined to be|lieve, that &s;he had then heard and &s;een Valancourt; but other recollections &s;oon convinced her of her error. On turning into a thicker part of the woods, &s;he perceived a per&s;on walking &s;low|ly in the gloom at &s;ome little di&s;tance, and, her mind engaged by the idea of him, &s;he &s;tarted and pau&s;ed, imagining this to be Valancourt. The per&s;on advanced with quicker &s;teps, and, be|fore &s;he could recover recollection enough to avoid him, he &s;poke, and &s;he then knew the voice of the Count, who expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, on finding her walking at &s;o early an hour, and made a feeble effort to rally her on her love of &s;olitude. But he &s;oon perceived this to be more a &s;ubject of concern than of light laugh|ter, and, changing his manner, affectionately expo&s;tulated with Emily, on thus indulging unavailing regret; who, though &s;he ac|knowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s of all he &s;aid, could not re&s;train her tears, while &s;he did &s;o, and he pre&s;ently quitted the topic. Ex|pre&s;&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e at not having yet heard from his friend, the Ad|vocate at Avignon, in an&s;wer to the que&s;tions propo&s;ed to him, re&s;pecting the e&s;tates of the late Madame Montoni, he, with friendly zeal, endeavoured to cheer Emily with hopes of e&s;tab|li&s;hing her claim to them; while &s;he felt, that the e&s;tates could now contribute little to the happine&s;s of a life, in which Valan|court had no longer an intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="029378_0287_0FE086FD677209A8">
When they returned to the chateau. Emily retired to her apart|ment, and Count de Villefort to the door of the north chambers. This was &s;till fa&s;tened, but, being now determined to arou&s;e Lu|dovico, he renewed his calls more loudly than before, after which a total &s;ilence en&s;ued, and the Count, finding all his efforts to be heard ineffectual, at length began to fear, that &s;ome accident had befallen Ludovico, whom terror of an imaginary being might have deprived of his &s;en&s;es. He, therefore, left the door with an intention of &s;ummoning his &s;ervants to force it open, &s;ome of whom he now heard moving in the lower part of the chateau.</P>
<P>To the Count's inquiries, whether they had &s;een or heard Lu|dovico, they replied in affright, that not one of them had ventur|ed on the north &s;ide of the chateau, &s;ince the preceding night.</P>
<P>"He &s;leeps &s;oundly then," &s;aid the Count, "and is at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the outer door, which is fa&s;tened, that to gain admittance to the chambers it will be nece&s;&s;ary to force it. Bring an in&s;trument, and follow me."</P>
<P>The &s;ervants &s;tood mute and dejected, and it was not till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all the hou&s;ehold were a&s;&s;embled, that the Count's orders were obeyed. In the mean time Dorothee was telling of a door that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from a gallery, leading from the great &s;tairca&s;e into the la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> room of the &s;aloon, and this being much nearer to the bed chamber, it appeared probable, that Ludovico might ea&s;ily be awakened by an attempt to open it. Thither, there|fore the Count went, but his voice was as ineffectual at this door as it had proved at the remoter one; and now, &s;eriou&s;ly intere&s;t|ed for Ludovico, he was him&s;elf going to &s;trike upon the door with the in&s;trument, when he ob&s;erved its &s;ingular beauty, and withheld the blow. It appeared, on the fir&s;t glance, to be of ebony, &s;o dark and clo&s;e was its grain and &s;o high its poli&s;h; but it proved to be only of larch wood of the growth of Pro|vence, then famous for its fore&s;ts of larch. The beauty of its poli&s;hed hue, and of its delicate carvings determined the Count to &s;pare this door, and he returned to that leading from the back &s;tairca&s;e, which being at length forced, he entered the fir&s;t anti room, followed by Henri and a few of the mo&s;t courageous of his &s;ervants, the re&s;t awaiting the event of the inquiry on the &s;tairs and landing place.</P>
<P>All was &s;ilent in the chambers, through which the Count pa&s;&s;|ed, and, having reached the &s;aloon, he called loudly upon Lu|dovico; after which, &s;till receiving no an&s;wer, he threw open the door of the bed room, and entered.</P>

The profound &s;tillne&s;s within confirmed his apprehen&s;ions for Ludovico, for not even the breathings of a per&s;on in &s;leep were heard; and his uncertainty was not &s;oon terminated, &s;ince, the &s;hutters being all clo&s;ed, the chamber was too dark for any object to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in it.</P>
<P>The Count bade a &s;ervant open them, who, as he cro&s;&s;ed the room to do &s;o, &s;tumbled over &s;omething, and fell to the floor, when his cry occa&s;ioned &s;uch panic among the few of his fellows, who had ventured thus far, that they in&s;tantly fled, and the Count and Henri were left to fini&s;h the adventure.</P>
<P>Henri then &s;prung acro&s;s the room, and opening a window &s;hutter, they perceived, that the man had fallen over a chair near the hearth, in which Ludovico had been &s;itting;&mdash;for he &s;at there no longer, nor could any where be &s;een by the im|perfect light that was admitted into the apartment. The Count, &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, now opened other &s;hutters, that he might be enabled to examine further, and, Ludovico not yet appearing, he &s;tood for a moment, &s;u&s;pended in a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;carcely tru&s;ting his &s;en&s;es, till, his eyes glancing on the bed, he advanc|ed to examine whether he was there a&s;leep. No per&s;on, how|ever, was in it, and he proceeded to the oriel, where every thing remained as on the preceding night, but Ludovico was no where to be found.</P>
<P>The Count now checked his amazement, con&s;idering that Ludovico might have left the chambers, during the night, overcome by the terrors, which their lonely de&s;o|lation and the recollected reports, concerning them, had in&s;pired. Yet if this had been the fact, the man would naturally have &s;ought &s;ociety, and his fellow &s;ervants had all declared they had not &s;een him; the door of the outer room al&s;o had been found fa&s;tened, with the key on the in&s;ide; it was impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, for him to have pa&s;&s;ed through that, and all the outer doors of this &s;uite were found, on examination, to be bolted and locked, with the keys al&s;o within them. The Count, being then compelled to believe, that the lad had e&s;cap|ed through the ca&s;ements, next examined them, but &s;uch as op|ened wide enough to admit the body of a man, were found to be carefully &s;ecured either by iron bars, or by &s;hutters, and no ve&s;tige appeared of any per&s;on having attempted to pa&s;s them; neither was it probable, that Ludovico would have incurred the ri&s;k of breaking his neck, by leaping from a window, when he might have walked &s;afely through a door.</P>
<P>The Count's amazement did not admit of words; but he re|turned once more to examine the bed room, where was no ap|pearance

of di&s;order, except that occa&s;ioned by the late over|throw of the chair rear which had &s;tood a &s;mall table, and on this Ludovico's &s;word, his lamp, the book he had been reading, and the remnant of his fla&s;k of wine &s;till remained. At the foot of the table, too, was the ba&s;ket with &s;ome fragments of pro|vi&s;ion and wood.</P>
<P>Henri and the &s;ervant now uttered their a&s;toni&s;hment with|out re&s;erve, and, though the Count &s;aid little, there was a &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s in his manner, that expre&s;&s;ed much. It appeared that Ludovico mu&s;t have quitted the&s;e rooms by &s;ome concealed pa&s;&s;age, for the Count could not believe that any &s;upernatural means had occa&s;ioned this event, yet, if there was any &s;uch pa&s;&s;age, it &s;eemed inexplicable why he &s;hould retreat through it, and it was equally &s;urpri&s;ing, that not even the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige &s;hould appear, by which his progre&s;s could be traced. In the rooms every thing remained as much in order as if he had ju&s;t walked out by the common way.</P>
<P>The Count him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted in lifting the arras, with which the bed chamber, &s;aloon and one of the anti rooms were hung, that he might di&s;cover if any door had been concealed behind it; but, after a laborious &s;earch, none was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, and he, at length, quitted the apartments, having &s;ecured the door of the la&s;t anti chamber, the key of which he took into his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He then gave orders, that &s;trict &s;earch &s;hould be made for Ludovico not only in the chateau, but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> neighbourhood, and retiring with Henri to his clo&s;et, they remained there, in conver&s;ation for a con&s;iderable time, and whatever was the &s;ubject of it, Hen|ri from this hour lo&s;t much of his vivacity, and his manners were particularly grave and re&s;erved, whenever the topic which now agitated the Count's family with wonder and alarm, was in|troduced.</P>
<P>On the di&s;appearing of Ludovico, Baron St. Foix &s;eemed &s;trengthened in all his former opinions concerning the probability of apparitions, though it was difficult to di&s;cover what connection there could po&s;&s;ibly be between the two &s;ubjects, or to account for this effect otherwi&s;e than by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the my&s;tery attend|ing Ludovico, by exciting awe and curio&s;ity, reduced the mind to a &s;tate of &s;en&s;ibility, which rendered it more liable to the in|fluence of &s;uper&s;tition in general. It is, however, certain, that from this period the Baron and his adherents became more big|oted to their own &s;y&s;tems than before, while the terrors of the Count's &s;ervants increa&s;ed to an exce&s;s that occa&s;ioned many of them to quit the man&s;ion immediately, and the re&s;t remained only till others could be procured to &s;upply their places.</P>

The mo&s;t &s;trenuous &s;earch after Ludovico proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and after &s;everal days of indefatigable inquiry, poor Annette gave her&s;elf up to de&s;pair, and the other inhabitants of the cha|teau to amazement.</P>
<P>Emily, who&s;e mind had been deeply affected by the di&s;a&s;ter|ous fate of the late Marchione&s;s and with the my&s;terious con|nection, which &s;he fancied had exi&s;ted between her and St. Au|bert, was particularly impre&s;&s;ed by the late extraordinary event, and much concerned for the lo&s;s of Ludovico, who&s;e integrity and faithful &s;ervices claimed both her e&s;teem and gratitude. She was now very de&s;irous to return to the quiet retirement of her convent, but every hint of this was received with real &s;orrow by the Lady Blanche, and affectionately &s;et a&s;ide by the Count, for whom &s;he felt much of the re&s;pectful love and admiration of a daughter, and to whom, by Dorothee's con&s;ent, &s;he at length, mentioned the appearance, which they had witne&s;&s;ed in the cham|ber of the decea&s;ed Marchione&s;s. At any other period he would have &s;miled at &s;uch a relation, and have believed that its object had exi&s;ted only in the di&s;tempered fancy of the relater; but he now attended to Emily with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and when &s;he conclud|ed, reque&s;ted of her a promi&s;e, that this occurrence &s;hould re&s;t in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"Whatever may be the cau&s;e and the import of the&s;e extraor|dinary occurrences," added the Count, "time only can explain them. I &s;hall keep a wary eye upon all that pa&s;&s;es in the cha|teau, and &s;hall pur&s;ue every po&s;&s;ible means of di&s;covering the fate of Ludovico. Meanwhile, we mu&s;t be prudent and be &s;i|lent. I will my&s;elf watch in the north chambers, but of this we will &s;ay nothing, till the night arrives, when I purpo&s;e doing &s;o."</P>
<P>The Count then &s;ent for Dorothee, and required of her al&s;o a promi&s;e of &s;ilence, concerning what &s;he had already or might in future witne&s;s of an extraordinary nature; and this ancient &s;ervant now related to him the particulars of the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi's death, with &s;ome of which he appeared to be al|ready acquainted, while by others he was evidently &s;urpri&s;ed and agitated. After li&s;tening to this narrative, the Count retired to his clo&s;et, where he remained alone for &s;everal hours; and, when he again appeared, the &s;olemnity of his manner &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed Emily, but &s;he gave no utterance to her thoughts.</P>
<P>On the week following the di&s;appearance of Ludovico, all the Count's gue&s;ts took leave of him, except the Baron, his &s;on Mon&s;. St. Foix, and Emily; the latter of whom was &s;oon after embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the arrival of another vi&s;itor, Mon&s;.

Du Pont, which made her determine upon withdrawing to her convent immediately. The delight that appeared in his coun|tenance, when he met her, told that he brought back the &s;ame ardour of pa&s;&s;ion which had formerly bani&s;hed him from Cha|teau-le-Blanc. He was received with re&s;erve by Emily, and with plea&s;ure by the Count, who pre&s;ented him to her with a &s;mile, that &s;eemed intended to plead his cau&s;e, and who did not hope the le&s;s for his friend, from the embarra&s;&s;ment &s;he betrayed.</P>
<P>But M. Du Pont, with truer &s;ympathy &s;eemed to under&s;tand her manner, and his countenance quickly lo&s;t its vivacity and &s;unk into the languor of de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>On the following day, however, he &s;ought an opportunity of declaring the purport of his vi&s;it, and renewed his &s;uit; a de|claration, which was received with real concern by Emily, who endeavoured to le&s;&s;en the pain &s;he might inflict by a &s;econd re|jection, with a&s;&s;urances of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip; yet &s;he left him in a &s;tate of mind, that claimed and excited her tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion; and being more &s;en&s;ible than ever of the impropri|ety of remaining longer at the chateau, &s;he immediately &s;ought the Count, and communicated to him her intention of returning to the convent.</P>
<P>"My dear Emily," &s;aid he, "I ob&s;erve, with extreme con|cern, the illu&s;ion you are encouraging&mdash;an illu&s;ion common to young and &s;en&s;ible minds. Your heart has received a &s;evere &s;hock; you believe you can never entirely recover it, and you will encourage this belief, till the habit of indulging &s;orrow will &s;ubdue the &s;trength of your mind, and di&s;colour your future views with melancholy and regret. Let me di&s;&s;ipate this illu&s;ion, and awaken you to a &s;en&s;e of your danger."</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled mournfully, "I know what you would &s;ay, my dear &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "and am prepared to an&s;wer you. I feel, that my heart can never know a &s;econd affection; and that I mu&s;t never hope even to recover its tranquillity&mdash;if I &s;uffer my|&s;elf to enter into a &s;econd engagement."</P>
<P>"I know, that you feel all this," replied the Count; "and I know, al&s;o, that time will overcome the&s;e feelings, unle&s;s you cheri&s;h them in &s;olitude, and, pardon me, with romantic tender|ne&s;s. Then, indeed, time will only confirm habit. I am parti|cularly empowered to &s;peak on this &s;ubject, and to &s;ympathize in your &s;ufferings," added the Count, with an air of &s;olemnity, "for I have known what it is to love, and to lament the object of my love. Yes," continued he, while his eyes filled with tears, "I have &s;uffered!&mdash;but tho&s;e times have pa&s;&s;ed away&mdash;long pa&s;&s;ed! and I can now look back upon them without emotion."</P>

<P>"They are weak tears, for they are u&s;ele&s;s ones," replied the Count, drying them, "I would have you &s;uperior to &s;uch weak|ne&s;s. The&s;e, however, are only faint traces of a grief, which, if it not had been oppo&s;ed by long continued effort, might have led me to the verge of madne&s;s! Judge, then, whether I have not cau&s;e to warn you of an indulgence, which may produce &s;o terrible an effect, and which mu&s;t certainly, if not oppo&s;ed, overcloud the years, that otherwi&s;e might be happy. M. Du Pont is a &s;en&s;ible and amiable man, who has long been tenderly attached to you; his family and fortune are unexceptionable;&mdash;after what I have &s;aid, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that I &s;hould rejoice in your feli|city, and that I think M. Du Pont would promote it. Do not weep, Emily," continued the Count, taking her hand, "there <HI>is</HI> happine&s;s re&s;erved for you."</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent a moment; and then added, in a firmer voice, "I do not wi&s;h that you &s;hould make a violent effort to over|come your feelings; all I, at pre&s;ent, a&s;k, is, that you will check the thoughts, that would lead you to a remembrance of the pa&s;t; that you will &s;uffer your mind to be engaged by pre&s;ent objects; that you will allow your&s;elf to believe it po&s;&s;ible you may yet be happy; and that you will &s;ometimes think with complacency of poor Du Pont, and not condemn him to the &s;tate of de&s;pondency, from which, my dear Emily, I am endeavouring to withdraw you."</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, while her tears &s;till fell, "do not &s;uffer the benevolence of your wi&s;hes to mi&s;lead Mon&s;. Du Pont with an expectation that I can ever accept his hand. If I under&s;tand my own heart, this can never be; your in&s;truction I can obey in almo&s;t every other particular, than that of adopt|ing a contrary belief."</P>
<P>"Leave me to under&s;tand your heart," replied the Count, with a faint &s;mile. "If you pay me the compliment to be guid|ed by my advice in other in&s;tances, I will pardon your incredu|lity, re&s;pecting your future conduct towards Mon&s;. Du Pont. I will not even pre&s;s you to remain longer at the chateau than your own &s;atisfaction will permit; but though I forbear to op|po&s;e your pre&s;ent retirement, I &s;hall urge the claims of friend|&s;hip for your future vi&s;its."</P>
<P>Tears of gratitude mingled with tho&s;e of tender regret, while Emily thanked the Count for the many in&s;tances of friend&s;hip &s;he had received from him; promi&s;ed to be directed by his ad|vice upon every &s;ubject but one, and a&s;&s;ured him of the

<P>The Count &s;miled at this condition. "Be it &s;o," &s;aid he, "meanwhile the convent is &s;o near the chateau, that my daugh|ter and I &s;hall often vi&s;it you; and if, &s;ometimes we &s;hould dare to bring you another vi&s;itor&mdash;will you forgive us?"</P>
<P>Emily looked di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Well," rejoined the Count, "I will pur&s;ue this &s;ubject no further, and mu&s;t now entreat your forgivene&s;s for having pre&s;&s;ed it thus far. You will, however, do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that I have been urged only by a &s;incere regard for your happi|ne&s;s, and that of my amiable friend Mon&s;. Du Pont."</P>
<P>Emily, when &s;he left the Count, went to mention her intend|ed departure to the Counte&s;s, who oppo&s;ed it with polite ex|pre&s;&s;ions of regret; after which, &s;he &s;ent a note to acquaint the lady abbe&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould return to the convent; and thither &s;he withdrew on the evening of the following day. M. Du Pont, in extreme regret, &s;aw her depart, while the Count endeavoured to cheer him with a hope, that Emily would &s;ometimes regard him with a more favourable eye.</P>
<P>She was plea&s;ed to find her&s;elf once more in the tranquil re|tirement of the convent, where &s;he experienced a renewal of all the maternal kindne&s;s of the abbe&s;s, and of the &s;i&s;terly attentions of the nuns. A report of the late extraordinary occurrence at the chateau had already reached them, and, after &s;upper, on the evening of her arrival, it was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation in the convent parlour, where &s;he was reque&s;ted to mention &s;ome par|ticulars of that unaccountable event. Emily was guarded in her conver&s;ation, on this &s;ubject, and briefly related a few cir|cum&s;tances concerning Ludovico, who&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;appearance, her au|ditors almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly agreed, had been effected by &s;uper|natural means.</P>

<P>"I dare not pre&s;ume to &s;ay what was his crime," replied &s;i&s;ter Frances; "but I have heard many reports of an extraordinary nature, re&s;pecting the late Marquis de Villeroi, and among oth|ers, that, &s;oon after the death of his lady, he quitted Chateau-le-Blanc, and never afterwards returned to it. I was not here at the time, &s;o I can only mention it from report, and &s;o many years have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the Marchione&s;s died, that few of our &s;i&s;terhood, I believe, can do more."</P>

<P>"I am," replied the nun; "but who &s;hall dare to &s;crutinize my thoughts&mdash;who &s;hall dare to pluck out my opinion? God only is his judge, and to that judge he is gone!"</P>

<P>"Never," &s;aid Emily. "I have, indeed, &s;ometimes, thought, that there was the melancholy of madne&s;s in her look, but never before perceived it in her &s;peech. Poor &s;oul I will pray for her!"</P>

<P>COUNT DE VILLEFORT, at length, received a letter from the advocate at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> encouraging Emily to a&s;&s;ert her claim to the e&s;tates of the late Madame Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, about the &s;ame time, a me&s;&s;enger arrived from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> with intelli|gence, that made an appeal to the law on this &s;ubject unnece&s;&s;ary,

&s;ince it appeared, that the only per&s;on, who could have oppo&s;ed her claim, was now no more. A friend of M. Que&s;nel, who re&s;id|ed at Venice, had &s;ent him an account of the death of Montoni, who had been brought to trial with Or&s;ino, as his &s;uppo&s;ed ac|complice in the murder of the Venetian nobleman. Or&s;ino was found guilty, condemned and executed upon the wheel, but no|thing being di&s;covered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> criminate Montoni, and his colleagues, on this charge, they were all relea&s;ed, except Montoni, who, being con&s;idered by the &s;enate as a very dangerous per&s;on, was, for other rea&s;ons, ordered again into confinement, where it was &s;aid, he had died in a doubtful and my&s;terious manner, and not with|out &s;u&s;picion of having been poi&s;oned. The authority, from which M. Que&s;nel had received this information, would not al|low him to doubt its truth, and he told Emily, that &s;he had now only to lay claim to the e&s;tates of her late aunt, to &s;ecure them, and added, that he would him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;t in the nece&s;&s;ary forms of this bu&s;ine&s;s. The term, for which La Vallee had been let be|ing now al&s;o nearly expired, he acquainted her with the circum|&s;tance, and advi&s;ed her to take the road thither, through Tho|lou&s;e, where he promi&s;ed to meet her, and where it would be proper for her to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tates of the late Madame Montoni; adding, that he would &s;pare her any difficulties, that might occur on that occa&s;ion from the want of knowledge on the &s;ubject, and that he believed it would be nece&s;&s;ary for her to be at Tholou&s;e, in about three weeks from the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>An increa&s;e of fortune &s;eemed to have awakened this &s;udden kindne&s;s in M. Que&s;nel towards his niece, and it appeared, that he entertained more re&s;pect for the rich heire&s;s, than he had ever felt compa&s;&s;ion for the poor and unfriended orphan.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure with which &s;he received this intelligence, was clouded when &s;he con&s;idered, that he, for who&s;e &s;ake &s;he had once regretted the want of fortune, was no longer worthy of &s;haring it with her; but, remembering the friendly admonition of the Count, &s;he checked this melancholy reflection, and endea|voured to feel only gratitude for the unexpected good, that now attended her; while it formed no incon&s;iderable part of her &s;at|isfaction to know, that La Vallee, her native home, which was endeared to her by it's having been the re&s;idence of her parents, would &s;oon be re&s;tored to her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. There &s;he meant to fix her future re&s;idence, for, though it could not be compared with the chateau at Tholou&s;e, either for extent, or magnificence, its plea&s;ant &s;cenes and the tender remembrances, that haunted them, had claims upon her heart, which &s;he was not inclined to &s;acri|fice
<PB N="131" REF="029378_0292_0FE0872D667B22A0">
to o&s;tentation. She wrote immediately to thank M. Que&s;|nel for the active intere&s;t he took in her concerns, and to &s;ay, that &s;he would meet him at Tholou&s;e at the appointed time.</P>
<P>When Count de Villefort, with Blanche, came to the convent to give Emily the advice of the advocate, he was informed of the contents of M. Que&s;nel's letter, and gave her his &s;incere con|gratulations, on the occa&s;ion; but &s;he ob&s;erved, that when the fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of &s;atisfaction had faded from his countenance, an unu&s;ual gravity &s;ucceeded, and &s;he &s;carcely he&s;itated to inquire its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"It has no new occa&s;ion," replied the Count; "I am harra&s;&s;|ed and perplexed by the confu&s;ion, into which my family is thrown by their fooli&s;h &s;uper&s;tition. Idle reports are floating round me, which I can neither admit to be true, or prove to be fal&s;e; and I am, al&s;o, very anxious about the poor fellow, Ludo|vico, concerning whom I have not been able to obtain informa|tion. Every part of the chateau and every part of the neighbour|hood, too, has I believe, been &s;earched, and I know not what further can be done, &s;ince I have already offered large rewards for the di&s;co|very of him. The keys of the north apartment I have not &s;uf|fered to be out of my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ince he di&s;appeared, and I mean to watch in tho&s;e chambers, my&s;elf, this very night."</P>
<P>Emily &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed for the Count, united her entreaties with tho&s;e of the Lady Blanche, to di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"What &s;hould I fear?" &s;aid he, "I have no faith in &s;uper|natural combats, and for human oppo&s;ition I &s;hall be prepared; my, I will even promi&s;e not to watch alone."</P>
<P>"But who, dear &s;ir, will have courage enough to watch with you?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"My &s;on," replied the Count. "If I am not carried off in the night," added he, &s;miling, "you &s;hall hear the re&s;ult of my adventure, to morrow."</P>
<P>The Count and Lady Blanche, &s;hortly afterwards, took leave of Emily, and returned to the chateau, where he informed Henri of his intention, who, not without &s;ome &s;ecret reluctance, con|&s;ented to be the partner of his watch; and, when the de&s;ign was mentioned after &s;upper, the Counte&s;s was terrified, and the Baron, and M. Du Pont joined with her in entreating, that he would not tempt his fate, as Ludovico had done. "We know not," added the Baron, "the nature, or the power of an evil &s;pirit; and that &s;uch a &s;pirit haunts tho&s;e chambers can now, I think, &s;carcely be doubted. Beware, my lord, how you provoke its vengeance, &s;ince it has already given us one terrible example
<PB N="132" REF="029378_0293_0FE087324756AD68">
of its malice. I allow it may be probable, that the &s;pirits of the dead are permitted to return to the earth only on occa&s;ions of high import; but the pre&s;ent import may be your de&s;truction."</P>
<P>The Count could not forbear &s;miling; "Do you think then, Baron," &s;aid he, "that my de&s;truction is of &s;ufficient importance to draw back to earth the &s;oul of the departed? Alas! my good friend, there is no occa&s;ion for &s;uch means to accompli&s;h the de|&s;truction of any individual. Wherever the my&s;tery re&s;ts, I tru&s;t I &s;hall, this night, be able to detect it. You know I am not &s;uper&s;titious."</P>
<P>"I know that you are incredulous," interrupted the Baron.</P>
<P>"Well, call it what you will, I meant to &s;ay, that, though you know I am free from &s;uper&s;tition&mdash;if any thing &s;upernatural has appeared. I doubt not it will appear to me, and if any &s;trange event hangs over my hou&s;e, or if any extraordinary tran&s;action has formerly been connected with it, I &s;hall probably be made acquainted with it. At all events I will invite di&s;covery; and, that I may be equal to a mortal attack, which in good truth, my friend, is what I mo&s;t expect, I &s;hall take care to be well armed."</P>
<P>The Count took leave of his family, for the night, with an a&s;|&s;umed gaiety, which but ill concealed the anxiety, that depre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits, and retired to the north apartments, accompanied by his &s;on and followed by the Baron, M. Du Pont and &s;ome of the dome&s;tics, who all bade him good night at the outer door. In the&s;e chambers every thing appeared as when he had la&s;t been here; even in the bed room no alteration was vi&s;ible, where he lighted his own fire, for none of the dome&s;tics could be prevailed upon to venture thither. After carefully examining the chamber and the oriel, the Count and Henri drew their chairs upon the hearth, &s;et a bottle of wine and a lamp before them, laid their &s;words upon the table, and, &s;tirring the wood into a blaze, began to conver&s;e on indifferent topics. But Henri was often &s;ilent and ab&s;tracted, and &s;ometimes threw a glance of mingled awe and curio&s;ity round the gloomy apartment; while the Count gradu|ally cea&s;ed to conver&s;e, and &s;at either lo&s;t in thought, or reading a volume of Tacitus, which he had brought to beguile the tediou&s;|ne&s;s of the night.</P>

<P>THE Baron St. Foix, whom anxiety for his friend had kept awake, ro&s;e early to inquire the event of the night, when, as he pa&s;&s;ed the Count's clo&s;et, hearing &s;teps within, he knocked at the door, and it was opened by his friend him&s;elf. Rejoicing to &s;ee him in &s;afety, and curious to learn the occurrences of the night, he had not immediately lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the unu&s;ual gravity, that over&s;pread the features of the Count, who&s;e re&s;erved an&s;wers fir&s;t occa&s;ioned him to notice it. The Count, then &s;mil|ing, endeavoured to treat the &s;ubject of his curio&s;ity with levity; but the Baron was &s;erious, and pur&s;ued his inquiries &s;o clo&s;ely, that the Count, at length, re&s;uming his gravity, &s;aid, "Well, my friend, pre&s;s the &s;ubject no further, I entreat you; and let me reque&s;t al&s;o, that you will hereafter be &s;ilent upon any thing you may think extraordinary in my future conduct. I do not &s;cruple to tell you, that I am unhappy, and that the watch of the la&s;t night has not a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to di&s;cover Ludovico; upon every occurrence of the night you mu&s;t excu&s;e my re&s;erve."</P>
<P>"But where is Henri?" &s;aid the Baron, with &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;appointment at this denial.</P>
<P>"He is well in his own apartment," replied the Count. "You will not que&s;tion him on this topic, my friend, &s;ince you know my wi&s;h."</P>
<P>"Certainly not," &s;aid the Baron &s;omewhat chagrined, "&s;ince it would be di&s;plea&s;ing to you; but methinks, my friend, you might rely on my di&s;cretion, and drop this unu&s;ual re&s;erve. However, you mu&s;t allow me to &s;u&s;pect, that you have &s;een rea|&s;on to become a convert to my &s;y&s;tem, and are no longer the in|credulous knight you lately appeared to be."</P>
<P>"Let us talk no more upon this &s;ubject," &s;aid the Count; "you may be a&s;&s;ured, that no ordinary circum&s;tance has impo&s;ed this &s;ilence upon me towards a friend, whom I have called &s;o for near thirty years; and my pre&s;ent re&s;erve cannot make you que&s;tion either my e&s;teem, or the &s;incerity of my friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"I will not doubt either," &s;aid the Baron, "though you mu&s;t allow me to expre&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e, at this &s;ilence."</P>
<P>"To me I will allow it," replied the Count, "but I earne&s;tly entreat that you will forbear to notice it to my family, as well as every thing remarkable you may ob&s;erve in my conduct to|wards them."</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="029378_0294_0FE0873CD58EE008">
The Baron readily promi&s;ed this, and, after conver&s;ing for &s;ometime on general topics, they de&s;cended to the breakfa&s;t room, where the Count met his family with a cheerful countenance, and evaded their inquiries by employing light ridicule, and a&s;|&s;uming an air of uncommon gaiety, while he a&s;&s;ured them, that they need not apprehend any evil from the north chambers, &s;ince Henri and him&s;elf had been permitted to return from them in &s;afety.</P>
<P>Henri, however, was le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in di&s;gui&s;ing his feelings. From his countenance an expre&s;&s;ion of terror was not entirely fad|ed; he was often &s;ilent and thoughtful, and, when he attempted to laugh at the eager inquiries of Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, it was evidently only an attempt.</P>
<P>In the evening, the Count called, as he had promi&s;ed, at the convent, and Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed to perceive a mixture of play|ful ridicule and of re&s;erve in his mention of the north apartment&punc; Of what had occurred there, however, he &s;aid nothing, and, when &s;he ventured to remind him of his promi&s;e to tell her the re&s;ult of his inquiries, and to a&s;k if he had received any proof, that tho&s;e chambers were haunted, his look became &s;olemn, for a moment, then, &s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, he &s;miled, and &s;aid, "My dear Emily, do not &s;uffer my lady abbe&s;s to infect your good under&s;tanding with the&s;e fancies; &s;he will teach you to ex|pect a gho&s;t in every dark room. But believe me," added he, with a profound &s;igh, "the apparition of the dead comes not on light or &s;portive errands, to terrify, or to &s;urpri&s;e the timid." He pau&s;ed, and fell into a momentary thoughtfulne&s;s, and then added, "We will &s;ay no more on this &s;ubject."</P>
<P>Soon after, he took leave, and, when Emily joined &s;ome of the nuns, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find them acquainted with a circum&s;tance which &s;he had carefully avoided to mention, and expre&s;&s;ing their admiration of his intrepidity in having dared to pa&s;s a night in the apartment, whence Ludovico had di&s;appear|ed; for &s;he had not con&s;idered with what rapidity a tale of won|der circulates. The nuns had acquired their information from pea&s;ants, who brought fruit to the mona&s;tery, and who&s;e whole attention had been fixed, &s;ince the di&s;appearance of Ludovico, on what was pa&s;&s;ing in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Emily li&s;tened in &s;ilence to the various opinions of the nuns, concerning the, conduct of the Count, mo&s;t of whom condemn|ed it as ra&s;h and pre&s;umptuous, affirming, that it was provoking the vengeance of an evil &s;pirit, thus to intrude upon its haunts.</P>
<P>Si&s;ter Frances contended, that the Count had acted with the bravery of a virtuous mind. He knew him&s;elf guiltle&s;s of
<PB N="135" REF="029378_0294_0FE0873CD58EE008">
aught, that &s;hould provoke a good &s;pirit, and did not fear the &s;pells of an evil one, &s;ince he could claim the protection of an higher Power, of Him, who can command the wicked and will protect the innocent.</P>
<P>"The guilty cannot claim that protection!" &s;aid &s;i&s;ter Agnes, "let the Count look to his conduct, that he do not forfeit his claim! Yet who is he, that &s;hall dare to call him&s;elf innocent!&mdash;all earthly innocence is but comparative. Yet &s;till how wide a&s;under are the extremes of guilt, and to what an horrible depth may we fall! Oh!"&mdash;</P>
<P>The nun, as &s;he concluded, uttered a &s;huddering &s;igh, that &s;tartled Emily, who, looking up, perceived the eyes of Agnes fixed on hers, after which the &s;i&s;ter ro&s;e, took her hand, gazed earne&s;tly upon her countenance, for &s;ome moments, in &s;ilence, and then &s;aid,</P>
<P>"You are young&mdash;you are innocent! I mean you are yet inno|cent of any great crime!&mdash;But you have pa&s;&s;ions in your heart,&mdash;&s;corpions; they &s;leep now&mdash;beware how you awaken them!&mdash;they will &s;ting you, even unto death!"</P>
<P>Emily, affected by the&s;e words and by the &s;olemnity, with which they were delivered, could not &s;uppre&s;s her tears.</P>
<P>"Ah! is it &s;o?" exclaimed Agnes, her countenance &s;often|ing from its &s;ternne&s;s&mdash;"&s;o young, and &s;o unfortunate! We are &s;i&s;ters, then indeed. Yet, there is no bond of kindne&s;s among the guilty," &s;he added, while her eyes re&s;umed their wild ex|pre&s;&s;ion, "no gentlene&s;s,&mdash;no peace, no hope! I knew them all once&mdash;my eyes could weep&mdash;but now they burn, for now, my &s;oul is fixed and fearle&s;s!&mdash;I lament no more!"</P>
<P>"Rather let us repent, and pray," &s;aid another nun. "We are taught to hope, that prayer and penitence will work our &s;al|vation. There is hope for all who repent!"</P>
<P>"Who repent and turn to the true faith," ob&s;erved &s;i&s;ter Frances.</P>
<P>"For all but me!" replied Agnes &s;olemnly, who pau&s;ed, and then abruptly added, "My head burns, I believe I am not well. O! could I &s;trike from my memory all former &s;cenes&mdash;the fig|ures that ri&s;e up like furies, to torment me!&mdash;I &s;ee them when I &s;leep, and, when I am awake, they are &s;till before my eyes! I &s;ee them now&mdash;now!</P>
<P>She &s;tood in a fixed attitude of horror, her &s;training eyes mov|ing &s;lowly round the room, as if they followed &s;omething. One of the nuns gently took her hand, to lead her from the parlour. Agnes became calm, drew her other hand acro&s;s her eyes, look|ed
<PB N="136" REF="029378_0295_0FE08742D49EBB78">
again, and, &s;ighing deeply, &s;aid, "They are gone&mdash;they are gone! I am feveri&s;h, I know not what I &s;ay. I am thus, &s;ome|times, but it will go off again, I &s;hall &s;oon be better. Was not that the ve&s;per bell?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Frances, "the evening &s;ervice is pa&s;&s;ed. Let Margaret lead you to your cell."</P>
<P>"You are right," replied &s;i&s;ter Agnes, "I &s;hall be better there. Good night, my &s;i&s;ters, remember me in your ori&s;ons!"</P>
<P>When they had withdrawn, Frances, ob&s;erving Emily's emo|tion, &s;aid, "Do not be alarmed, our &s;i&s;ter is often thus derang|ed though I have not lately &s;een her &s;o frantic; her u&s;ual mood is melancholy. This fit has been coming on, for &s;everal days; &s;eclu&s;ion and the cu&s;tomary treatment will re&s;tore her."</P>
<P>"But how rationally &s;he conver&s;ed, at fir&s;t!" ob&s;erved Emi|ly," "her ideas followed each other in perfect order."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied the nun, "this is nothing new; nay, I have &s;ometimes known her argue not only with method, but with acutene&s;s, and then, in a moment, &s;tart off into madne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Her con&s;cience &s;eems afflicted," &s;aid Emily, "did you ever hear what circum&s;tance reduced her to this deplorable con|dition?"</P>
<P>"I have," replied the nun, who &s;aid no more till Emily re|peated the que&s;tion, when &s;he added in a low voice, and look|ing &s;ignificantly towards the other boarders, "I cannot tell you now, but, if you think it worth your while, come to my cell, to night, when our &s;i&s;terhood are at re&s;t, and you &s;hall hear more; but remember we ri&s;e to midnight prayers, and come either be|fore or after midnight."</P>
<P>Emily promi&s;ed to remember, and the abbe&s;s &s;oon after ap|pearing, they &s;poke no more of the unhappy nun.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, on his return home, had found M. Du Pont in one of tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its of de&s;pondency, which his attach|ment to Emily frequently occa&s;ioned him, an attachment, that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted too long to be ea&s;ily &s;ubdued, and which had already outlived the oppo&s;ition of his friends. M. Du Pont had fir&s;t &s;een Emily in Ga&s;cony, during the lifetime of his parent, who, on di&s;covering his &s;on's partiality for Mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert, his inferior in point of fortune, forbade him to declare it to her family, or to think of her more. During the life of his father, he had ob&s;erved the fir&s;t command, but had found it impractica|ble to obey the &s;econd, and had, &s;ometimes &s;oothed his pa&s;&s;ion by vi&s;iting her favourite haunts, among which was the fi&s;hing hou&s;e, where once or twice, he addre&s;&s;ed her in ver&s;e, concealing
<PB N="137" REF="029378_0295_0FE08742D49EBB78">
his name, in obedience to the promi&s;e he had given his father. There too he played the pathetic air, to which &s;he had li&s;tened with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;e and admiration; and there he found the miniature that had &s;ince cheri&s;hed a pa&s;&s;ion fatal to his repo&s;e. During his ex|pedition into Italy, his father died; but he received his liberty at a moment, when he was the lea&s;t enabled to profit by it, &s;ince the object that rendered it mo&s;t valuable, was no longer within the reach of his vows. By what accident he di&s;covered Emily, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to relea&s;e her from a terrible impri&s;onment, has already appeared, and al&s;o the unavailing hope, with which he then en|couraged his love, and the fruitle&s;s efforts, that he had &s;ince made to overcome it.</P>
<P>The Count &s;till endeavoured, with friendly zeal, to &s;ooth him with a belief, that patience, per&s;everance and prudence, would finally obtain for him happine&s;s and Emily; "Time," &s;aid he, "will wear away the melancholy impre&s;&s;ion, which di&s;appoint|ment has left on her mind, and &s;he will be &s;en&s;ible of your merit. Your &s;ervices have already awakened her gratitude, and your &s;uf|erings her pity; and tru&s;t me, my friend, in a heart &s;o &s;en&s;ible as hers, gratitude and pity lead to love. When her imagination is re&s;|cued from its pre&s;ent delu&s;ion, &s;he will readily accept the hom|age of a mind like yours."</P>
<P>Du Pont &s;ighed, while he li&s;tened to the&s;e words; and, en|deavouring to hope what his friend believed, he willingly yield|ed to an invitation to prolong his vi&s;it at the chateau, which we now leave for the mona&s;tery of St. Claire.</P>
<P>When the nuns had retired to re&s;t, Emily &s;tole to her appoint|ment with &s;i&s;ter Frances, whom &s;he found in her cell, engaged in prayer, before a little table, where appeared the image &s;he was addre&s;&s;ing, and above, the dim lamp, that gave light to the place. Turning her eyes, as the door opened, &s;he beckoned to Emily to come in, who having done &s;o, &s;eated her&s;elf in &s;ilence be&s;ide the nun's little mattre&s;s of &s;traw, till her ori&s;ons &s;hould conclude. The latter &s;oon ro&s;e from her knees, and, taking down the lamp and placing it on the table, Emily perceived there a human &s;cull and bones, lying be&s;ide an hour gla&s;s; but the nun, without ob&s;erving her emotion, &s;at down on the mat|tre&s;s by her, &s;aying, "Your curio&s;ity, &s;i&s;ter, has made you punct|ual, but you have nothing remarkable to hear in the hi&s;|tory of poor Agnes, of whom I avoided to &s;peak in the pre&s;ence of my lay &s;i&s;ters, only becau&s;e I would not publi&s;h her crime to them."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall con&s;ider your confidence in me as a favour," &s;aid Em|ily, "and will not mi&s;u&s;e it."</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="029378_0296_0FE0874D430E7880">
"Si&s;ter Agnes," re&s;umed the nun, "is of a noble family, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s the dignity of her air mu&s;t already have informed you, but I will not di&s;honour their name &s;o much as to reveal it. Love was the occa&s;ion of her crime and of her madne&s;s. She was beloved by a gentleman of inferior fortune, and her father, as I have heard, be&s;towing her on a nobleman, whom &s;he di&s;liked, an ill governed pa&s;&s;ion proved her de&s;truction.&mdash;Every obliga|tion of virtue and of duty was forgotten, and &s;he prophaned her marriage vows; but her guilt was &s;oon detected, and &s;he would have fallen a &s;acrifice to the vengeance of her hu&s;band, had not her father contrived to convey her from his power. By what means he did this, I never could learn; but he &s;ecreted her in this convent, where he afterwards prevailed with her to take the veil, while a report was circulated in the world, that &s;he was dead, and the father, to &s;ave his daughter, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the rumour, and em|ployed &s;uch means as induced her hu&s;band to believe &s;he had be|come a victim to his jealou&s;y. You look &s;urpri&s;ed," added the nun, ob&s;erving Emily's countenance; "I allow the &s;tory is un|common, but not, I believe, without a parallel."</P>
<P>"Pray proceed," &s;aid Emily, "I am intere&s;ted."</P>
<P>"The &s;tory is already told," re&s;umed the nun, "I have only to mention, that the long &s;truggle, which Agnes &s;uffered, be|tween love, remor&s;e and a &s;en&s;e of the duties &s;he had taken up|on her&s;elf in becoming of our order, at length un&s;ettled her rea|&s;on. At fir&s;t, &s;he was frantic and melancholy by quick alterna|tives; then &s;he &s;unk into a deep and &s;ettled melancholy, which &s;till, however, has at times, been interrupted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its of wildne&s;s, and, of late, the&s;e have again been frequent."</P>
<P>Emily was affected by the hi&s;tory of the &s;i&s;ter, &s;ome parts of who&s;e &s;tory brought to her remembrance that of the Marchion|e&s;s de Villeroi, who had al&s;o been compelled by her father to for&s;ake the object of her affections, for a nobleman of his choice, but, from what Dorothee had related, there appeared no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;he had e&s;caped the vengeance of a jealous hu&s;|band, or to doubt for a moment the innocence of her conduct. But Emily, while &s;he &s;ighed over the mi&s;ery of the nun, could not forbear &s;hedding a few tears to the misfortunes of the Mar|chione&s;s; and when &s;he returned to the mention of &s;i&s;ter Agnes, &s;he a&s;ked Frances if &s;he remembered her in her youth, and whether &s;he was then beautiful.</P>
<P>"I was not here at the time, when &s;he took the vows," replied Frances, "which is &s;o long ago, that few of the pre&s;ent &s;i&s;terhood, I believe, were witne&s;&s;es of the ceremony; nay, even our lady
<PB N="139" REF="029378_0296_0FE0874D430E7880">
mother did not then pre&s;ide over the convent: but I can remem|ber, when &s;i&s;ter Agnes was a very beautiful woman. She retains that air of high rank, which always di&s;tingui&s;hed her, but her beauty, you mu&s;t perceive, is fled; I can &s;carcely di&s;cover even a ve&s;tige of the loveline&s;s, that once animated her features."</P>
<P>"It is &s;trange," &s;aid Emily, "but there are moments, when her countenance has appeared familiar to my memory! You will think me fanciful, and I think my&s;elf &s;o, for I certainly nev|er &s;aw &s;i&s;ter Agnes, before I came to this convent, and I mu&s;t, therefore, have &s;een &s;ome per&s;on, whom &s;he &s;trongly re&s;embles, though of this I have no recollection."</P>
<P>"You have been intere&s;ted by the deep melancholy of her countenance," &s;aid Frances, "and its impre&s;&s;ion has probably deluded your imagination; for I might as rea&s;onably think I per|ceived a likene&s;s between you and Agnes, as you, that you have &s;een her any where but in this convent, &s;ince this has been her place of refuge, for nearly as many years as make your age."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes," rejoined Frances, "and why does that circum&s;tance excite your &s;urpri&s;e?"</P>
<P>Emily did not appear to notice this que&s;tion, but remained thoughtful, for a few moments, and then &s;aid, "It was about that &s;ame period that the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi expired."</P>
<P>"That is an odd remark," &s;aid Frances.</P>
<P>Emily, recalled from her reverie, &s;miled, and gave the conver|&s;ation another turn, but it &s;oon came back to the &s;ubject of the unhappy nun, and Emily remained in the cell of &s;i&s;ter Frances, till the midnight bell arou&s;ed her; when apologizing for hav|ing interrupted the &s;i&s;ter's repo&s;e, till this late hour, they quitted the cell together. Emily returned to her chamber, and the nun, bearing a glimmering taper, went to her devotion in the chapel.</P>
<P>Several days followed, during which Emily &s;aw neither the Count, or any of his family; and, when, at length, he appeared, &s;he remarked, with concern, that his air was unu&s;ually di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>"My &s;pirits are harra&s;&s;ed," &s;aid he, in an&s;wer to her anxious inquiries, 'and I mean to change my re&s;idence for a little while, an experiment, which, I hope, will re&s;tore my mind to its u&s;ual tranquillity. My daughter and my&s;elf will accompany the Ba|ron St. Foix to his chateau. It lies in a valley of the Pyrenees, that opens towards Ga&s;cony, and I have been thinking, Emily, that when you &s;et out for La Vallee, we may go part of the way together; it would be a &s;atisfaction to me to guard you towards your home.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="029378_0297_0FE08752E235F328">
She thanked the Count for his friendly con&s;ideration, and la|mented, that the nece&s;&s;ity for her going fir&s;t to Tholou&s;e would render this plan impracticable&punc; "But, when you are at the Ba|ron's re&s;idence," &s;he added, "you will be only a &s;hort journey from La Vallee, and I think, &s;ir, you will not leave the country without vi&s;iting me; it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay with what plea&s;ure I &s;hould receive you and the Lady Blanche."</P>
<P>"I do not doubt it," replied the Count, "and I will not deny my&s;elf and Blanche the plea&s;ure of vi&s;iting you, if your affairs &s;hould allow you to be at La Vallee, about the time when we can meet you there."</P>
<P>When Emily &s;aid that &s;he &s;hould hope to &s;ee the Counte&s;s al&s;o, &s;he was not &s;orry to learn that this lady was going, accompanied by Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, to pay a vi&s;it, for a few weeks, to a family in lower Languedoc.</P>
<P>The Count, after &s;ome further conver&s;ation on his intended journey and on the arrangement of Emily's, took leave; and many days did not &s;ucceed this vi&s;it, before a &s;econd letter from M. Que&s;nel informed her, that he was then at Tholou&s;e, that La Valle was at liberty, and that he wi&s;hed her to &s;et off for the former place, where he awaited her arrival, with all po&s;|&s;ible di&s;patch, &s;ince his own affairs pre&s;&s;ed him to return to Ga&s;|cony. Emily did not he&s;itate to obey him, and, having taken an affecting leave of the Count's family, in which M. Du Pont was &s;till included, and of her friends at the convent, &s;he &s;et out for Tholou&s;e, attended by the unhappy Annette, and guarded by a &s;teady &s;ervant of the Count.</P>

<P>EMILY pur&s;ued her journey, without any accident, along the plains of Languedoc towards the north we&s;t; and, on this her return to Tholou&s;e, which &s;he had la&s;t left with Madame Montoni, &s;he thought much on the melancholy fate of her aunt, who, but for her own imprudence, might now have been living in happine&s;s there! Montoni, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, often ro&s;e to her fancy, &s;uch

as &s;he had &s;een him in his days of triumph, bold, &s;pirited and commanding; &s;uch al&s;o as &s;he had &s;ince beheld him in his days of vengeance; and now, only a few &s;hort months had pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;and he had no longer the power, or the will to afflict;&mdash;he had become a clod of earth, and his life was vani&s;hed like a &s;hadow! Emily could have wept at his fate, had &s;he not remembered his crimes; for that of her unfortunate aunt &s;he did weep, and all &s;en&s;e of her errors was overcome by the recollection of her mi&s;|fortunes.</P>
<P>Other thoughts and other emotions &s;ucceeded, as Emily drew near the well known &s;cenes of her early love, and con&s;idered, that Valancourt was lo&s;t to her and to him&s;elf, for ever. At length, &s;he came to the brow of the hill, whence, on her departure for Italy, &s;he had given a farewel look to this beloved land&s;cape, among&s;t who&s;e woods and fields &s;he had &s;o often walked with Valancourt, and where he was then to inhabit, when &s;he would be far, far away! She &s;aw, once more, that chain of the Pyre|nees, which overlooked La Vallee, ri&s;ing, like faint clouds, on the horizon. "There, too, is Ga&s;cony, extended at their feet!" &s;aid &s;he, "O my father,&mdash;my mother! And there, too, is the Garonne!" &s;he added, drying the tears, that ob&s;cured her &s;ight, "and Tholou&s;e, and my aunt's man&s;ion, and the groves in her gar|den!&mdash;O my friends! are ye all lo&s;t to me&mdash;mu&s;t I never, never &s;ee ye more!" Tears ru&s;hed again to her eyes, and &s;he continued to weep, till an abrupt turn in the road had nearly occa&s;ioned the carriage to over&s;et, when, looking up, &s;he perceived another part of the well known &s;cene around Tholou&s;e, and all the reflections and anticipations, which &s;he had &s;uffered, at the moment, when &s;he bade it la&s;t adieu, came with recollected force to her heart. She remembered how anxiou&s;ly &s;he had looked forward to the futurity, which was to decide her happine&s;s concerning Valan|court, and what depre&s;&s;ing fears had a&s;&s;ailed her; the very words &s;he had uttered, as &s;he withdrew her la&s;t look from the pro&s;pect, came to her memory. "Could I but be certain," &s;he had then &s;aid, "that I &s;hould ever return, and that Valancourt would &s;till live for me&mdash;I &s;hould go in peace!"</P>
<P>Now, that futurity, &s;o anxiou&s;ly anticipated, was arrived, &s;he was returned&mdash;but what a dreary blank appeared!&mdash;Valancourt no longer lived for her! She had no longer even the melancholy &s;atisfaction of contemplating his image in her heart, for he was no longer the &s;ame Valancourt &s;he had cheri&s;hed there&mdash;the &s;o|lace of many a mournful hour, the animating friend, that had en|abled her to bear up again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of Montoni&mdash;the di&s;|tant
<PB N="142" REF="029378_0298_0FE0876334D75BE8">
hope, that had beamed over her gloomy pro&s;pect! On per|ceiving this beloved idea to be an illu&s;ion of her own creation, Valancourt &s;eemed to be annihilated, and her &s;oul &s;ickened at the blank, that remained. His marriage with a rival, even his death, &s;he thought &s;he could have endured with more fortitude, than this di&s;covery; for then, amid&s;t all her grief, &s;he could have looked in &s;ecret upon the image of goodne&s;s, which her fancy had drawn of him, and comfort would have mingled with her &s;uffering!</P>
<P>Drying her tears, &s;he looked once more upon the land&s;cape, which had excited them, and perceived, that &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing the very bank where &s;he had taken leave of Valancourt, on the morning of her departure from Tholou&s;e, and &s;he now &s;aw him, through her returning tears, &s;uch as he had appeared, when &s;he looked from the carriage to give him a la&s;t adieu&mdash;&s;aw him leaning mournfully again&s;t the high trees, and remembered the fixed look of mingled tenderne&s;s and angui&s;h, with which he had then regarded her. This recollection was too much for her heart, and &s;he &s;unk back in the carriage, nor once looked up, till it &s;topped at the gates of what was now her own man&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e being opened, and by the &s;ervant, to who&s;e care the chateau had been entru&s;ted, the carriage drove into the court, where, alighting, &s;he ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed through the great hall, now &s;ilent and &s;olitary, to a large oak parlour, the common &s;itting room of the late Madame Montoni, where, in&s;tead of being re|ceived by M. Que&s;nel, &s;he found a letter from him, informing her, that bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence had obliged him to leave Tho|lou&s;e two days before. Emily was, upon the whole, not &s;orry to be &s;pared his pre&s;ence, &s;ince his abrupt departure appeared to indicate the &s;ame indifference, with which he had formerly re|garded her. This letter informed her, al&s;o, of the progre&s;s he had made in the &s;ettlement of her affairs, and concluded with di|rections, concerning the forms of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, which remained for her to tran&s;act. But M. Que&s;nel's unkindne&s;s did not long occupy her thoughts, which returned to the remembrance of the per&s;ons &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee in this man&s;ion, and chiefly of the ill guided and unfortunate Madame Montoni. In the room, where &s;he now &s;at, &s;he had breakfa&s;ted with her on the morning of their departure for Italy; and the view of it brought mo&s;t forcibly to her recollection all &s;he had her&s;elf &s;uffered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that time, and the many gay expectations, which her aunt had formed, re&s;pecting the journey before her. While Emily's mind was thus engaged, her eyes wandered uncon&s;ciou&s;ly to a large
<PB N="143" REF="029378_0298_0FE0876334D75BE8">
window, that looked upon the garden, and here new memorials of the pa&s;t &s;poke to her heart, for &s;he &s;aw extended before her, the very avenue, in which &s;he had parted with Valancourt, on the eve of her journey; and all the anxiety, the tender intere&s;t he had &s;hewn, concerning her future happine&s;s, his earne&s;t remon|&s;trances again&s;t her committing her&s;elf to the power of Montoni, and the truth of his affection, came afre&s;h to her memory. At this moment, it appeared almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, that Valancourt could have become unworthy of her regard, and &s;he doubted all that &s;he had lately heard to his di&s;advantage, and even his own words, which had confirmed Count De Villefort's report of him. Over|come by the recollections, which the view of this avenue occa|&s;ioned, &s;he turned abruptly from the window, and &s;unk into a chair be&s;ide it, where &s;he &s;at, given up to grief, till the entrance of Annette, with coffee, arou&s;ed her.</P>
<P>"Dear madam, how melancholy this place looks now," &s;aid Annette, "to what it u&s;ed to do! It is di&s;mal coming home, when there is nobody to welcome one!"</P>
<P>This was not the moment, in which Emily could bear the remark; her tears fell again, and as &s;oon as &s;he had taken the coffee, &s;he retired to her apartment, where &s;he endeavoured to repo&s;e her fatigued &s;pirits. But bu&s;y memory would &s;till &s;upply her with the vi&s;ions of former times: &s;he &s;aw Valancourt inter|e&s;ting and benevolent, as he had been wont to appear in the days of their early love, and, amid&s;t the &s;cenes, where &s;he had believ|ed that they &s;hould &s;ometimes pa&s;s their years together!&mdash;but, at length, &s;leep clo&s;ed&punc; the&s;e afflicting &s;cenes from her view.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;erious occupation recovered her from &s;uch melancholy reflections; for, being de&s;irous of quitting Tholou&s;e, and of ha&s;tening on to La Vallee, &s;he made &s;ome in|quiries into the condition of the e&s;tate, and immediately di&s;|patched a part of the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s concerning it, according to the directions of Mon&s;. Que&s;nel. It required a &s;trong effort to ab&s;tract her thoughts from other intere&s;ts &s;ufficiently to attend to this, but &s;he was rewarded for her exertions by again experi|encing, that employment is the &s;ure&s;t antidote to &s;orrow.</P>
<P>This day was devoted entirely to bu&s;ine&s;s; and, among other concerns, &s;he employed means to learn the &s;ituation of all her poor tenants, that &s;he might relieve their wants, or confirm their comforts.</P>
<P>In the evening, her &s;pirits were &s;o much &s;trengthened, that &s;he thought &s;he could bear to vi&s;it the gardens, where &s;he had &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> walked with Valancourt; and, knowing, that, if &s;he de|layed
<PB N="144" REF="029378_0299_0FE087680C134348">
to do &s;o, their &s;cenes would only affect her the more, when|ever they &s;hould be viewed, &s;he took advantage of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her mind, and entered them.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing ha&s;tily the gate leading from the court into the gar|dens, &s;he hurried up the great avenue, &s;carcely permitting her memory to dwell for a moment on the circum&s;tance of her hav|ing here parted with Valancourt, and &s;oon quitted this for other walks le&s;s intere&s;ting to her heart. The&s;e brought her, at length, to the flight of &s;teps, that led from the lower garden to the ter|race, on &s;eeing which, &s;he became agitated, and he&s;itated whether to a&s;cend, but, her re&s;olution returning, &s;he proceeded.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Emily, as &s;he a&s;cended, "the&s;e are the &s;ame high trees, that u&s;ed to wave over the terrace, and the&s;e the &s;ame flowery thickets&mdash;the libernum, the wild ro&s;e, and the cerinthe, which were wont to grow beneath them! Ah! and there, too, on that bank, are the very plants, which Valancourt &s;o carefully reared!&mdash;O when la&s;t I &s;aw them!"&mdash;She checked the thought, but could not re&s;train her tears, and, after walking &s;lowly on for a few moments, her agitation, upon the view of this well known &s;cene, increa&s;ed &s;o much, that &s;he was obliged to &s;top, and lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> upon the wall of the terrace. It was a mild, and beautiful even|ing. The &s;un was &s;etting over the exten&s;ive land&s;cape, to which his beams, &s;loping from beneath a dark cloud, that overhung the we&s;t, gave rich and partial colouring, and touched the tufted &s;ummits of the groves, that ro&s;e from the garden below, with a yellow gleam. Emily and Valancourt had often admired to|gether this &s;cene, at the &s;ame hour; and it was exactly on this &s;pot, that, on the night preceding her departure for Italy, &s;he had li&s;tened to his remon&s;trances again&s;t the journey, and to the pleadings of pa&s;&s;ionate affection. Some ob&s;ervations, which &s;he made on the land&s;cape, brought this to her remembrance, and with it all the minute particulars of that conver&s;ation: the alarm|ing doubts he had expre&s;&s;ed concerning Montoni, doubts, which had &s;ince been fatally confirmed; the rea&s;ons and entreaties he had employed to prevail with her to con&s;ent to an immediate marriage; the tenderne&s;s of his love, the paroxy&s;ms of his grief, and the conviction he had repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed, that they &s;hould never meet again in happine&s;s! All the&s;e circum&s;tances ro&s;e afre&s;h to her mind, and awakened the various emotions &s;he had then &s;uffered. Her tenderne&s;s for Valancourt became as power|ful as in the moments, when &s;he thought, that &s;he was parting with him and happine&s;s together, and when the &s;trength of her mind had enabled her to triumph over pre&s;ent &s;uffering, rather
<PB N="145" REF="029378_0299_0FE087680C134348">
than to de&s;erve the reproach of her con&s;cience by engaging in a clande&s;tine marriage. "Alas!" &s;aid Emily, as the&s;e recollec|tions came to her mind, "and what have I gained by the forti|tude I then practi&s;ed?&mdash;am I happy now?&mdash;He &s;aid, we &s;hould meet no more in happine&s;s; but, O! he little thought his own mi&s;conduct would &s;eparate us, and lead to the very evil he then dreaded!"</P>
<P>Her reflections increa&s;ed her angui&s;h, while &s;he was compell|ed to acknowledge, that the fortitude &s;he had formerly exerted, if it had not conducted her to happine&s;s, had &s;aved her from irre|trievable misfortune&mdash;from Valancourt him&s;elf! But in the&s;e moments &s;he could not congratulate her&s;elf on the prudence, that had &s;aved her; &s;he could only lament, with bittere&s;t angui&s;h, the circum&s;tances, which had con&s;pired to betray Valancourt into a cour&s;e of life &s;o different from that, which the virtues, the ta&s;te, and the pur&s;uits of his early years had promi&s;ed; but &s;he &s;till loved him too well to believe, that his heart was even now de|praved, though his conduct had been criminal. An ob&s;ervation, which had fallen from M. St. Aubert more than once, now oc|curred to her. "This young man," &s;aid he, &s;peaking of Valan|court, "has never been at Paris;" a remark, that had &s;urpri&s;ed her at the time it was uttered, but which &s;he now under&s;tood, and &s;he exclaimed &s;orrowfully, "O Valancourt! if &s;uch a friend as my father had been with you at Paris&mdash;your noble, ingenuous nature would not have fallen!"</P>
<P>The &s;un was now &s;et, and, recalling her thoughts from their mel|ancholy &s;ubject, &s;he continued her walk; for the pen&s;ive &s;hade of twilight was plea&s;ing to her, and the nightingales from the &s;urrounding groves began to an&s;wer each other in the long drawn, plaintive note, which always touched her heart; while all the fragrance of the flowery thickets, that bounded the terrace, was awakened by the cool evening air, which floated &s;o lightly among their leaves, that they &s;carcely trembled as it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Emily came, at length, to the &s;teps of the pavilion, that ter|minated the terrace, and where her la&s;t interview with Valan|court, before her departure from Tholou&s;e, had &s;o unexpectedly taken place. The door was now &s;hut, and &s;he trembled, while &s;he he&s;itated whether to open it; but her wi&s;h to &s;ee again a place, which had been the chief &s;cene of her former happine&s;s, at length overcoming her reluctance to encounter the painful regret it would renew, &s;he entered. The room was ob&s;cured by a mel|ancholy &s;hade; but through the open lattices, darkened by the hanging foliage of the vines, appeared the du&s;ky land&s;cape, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="146" REF="029378_0300_0FE087738818B160">
Garonne reflecting the evening light, and the we&s;t &s;till glowing. A chair was placed near one of the balconies, as if &s;ome per&s;on had been &s;itting there, but the other furniture of the pavilion remained exactly as u&s;ual, and Emily thought it looked as if it had not once been moved &s;ince &s;he &s;et out for Italy. The &s;ilent and de&s;erted air of the place added &s;olemnity to her emotions, for &s;he heard only the low whi&s;per of the breeze, as it &s;hook the leaves of the vines, and the very faint murmur of the Garonne.</P>
<P>She &s;eated her&s;elf in a chair, near the lattice, and yielded to the &s;adne&s;s of her heart, while &s;he recollected the circum&s;tances of her parting interview with Valancourt, on this &s;pot. It was here too, that &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the happie&s;t hours of her life with him, when her aunt favoured the connection, for here &s;he had often &s;at and worked, while he conver&s;ed, or read; and &s;he now well remembered with what di&s;criminating judgment, with what tempered energy, he u&s;ed to repeat &s;ome of the &s;ub|lime&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of their favourite authors; how often he would pau&s;e to admire with her their excellence, and with what ten|der delight he would li&s;ten to her remarks, and correct her ta&s;te.</P>
<P>"And is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Emily, as the&s;e recollections re|turned, "is it po&s;&s;ible, that a mind &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful, could &s;toop to low pur&s;uits, and be &s;ub|dued by frivolous temptations?"</P>
<P>She remembered how often &s;he had &s;een the &s;udden tear &s;tart in his eye, and had heard his voice tremble with emotion, while he related any great or benevolent action, or repeated a &s;enti|ment of the &s;ame character. "And &s;uch a mind," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;uch a heart, were to be &s;acrificed to the habits of a great city!"</P>
<P>The&s;e recollections becoming too painful to be endured, &s;he abruptly left the pavilion, and, anxious to e&s;cape from the me|morials of her departed happine&s;s, returned towards the cha|teau. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along the terrace, &s;he perceived a per&s;on, walking with a &s;low &s;tep, and a dejected air, under the trees, at &s;ome di&s;tance. The twilight, which was now deep, would not allow her to di&s;tingui&s;h who it was, and&punc; &s;he imagined it to be one of the &s;ervants, till, the &s;ound of her &s;teps &s;eeming to reach him, he turned half round, and &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw Valancourt!</P>
<P>Whoever it was, he in&s;tantly &s;truck among the thickets on the left, and di&s;appeared, while Emily, her eyes fixed on the place whence he had vani&s;hed, and her frame trembling &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that &s;he could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf, remained, for &s;ome mo|ments, unable to quit the &s;pot, and &s;carcely con&s;cious of exi&s;tence.
<PB N="147" REF="029378_0300_0FE087738818B160">
With her recollection, her &s;trength returned, and &s;he hurried to|ward the hou&s;e, where &s;he did not venture to inquire who had been in the gardens, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould betray her emotion; and &s;he &s;at down alone, endeavouring, to recollect the figure, air and fea|tures of the per&s;on &s;he had ju&s;t &s;een. Her view of him, how|ever, had been &s;o tran&s;ient, and the gloom had rendered it &s;o imperfect, that &s;he could remember nothing with exactne&s;s; yet the general appearance of his figure, and his abrupt departure, made her &s;till believe that this per&s;on was Valancourt. Sometimes, indeed, &s;he thought, that her fancy, which had been occupied by the idea of him, had &s;ugge&s;ted his image to her uncertain &s;ight: but this conjecture was fleeting. If it was him&s;elf, whom &s;he had &s;een, &s;he wondered much, that he &s;hould be at Tholou&s;e, and more, how he had gained admittance into the garden; but as often as her impatience prompted her to inquire whether any &s;tranger had been admitted, &s;he was re&s;trained by an unwilling|ne&s;s to betray her doubts, and the evening was pa&s;&s;ed in anxi|ous conjecture, and in efforts to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject from her thoughts. But the&s;e endeavours were ineffectual, and a thou&s;|and incon&s;i&s;tent emotions a&s;&s;ailed her, whenever &s;he fancied that Valancourt might be near her; now &s;he dreaded it to be true, and now &s;he feared it to be fal&s;e; and, while &s;he con&s;tantly tri|ed to per&s;uade her&s;elf, that &s;he wi&s;hed the per&s;on, whom &s;he had &s;een, might not be Valancourt, her heart as con&s;tantly con|tradicted her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The following day was occupied by the vi&s;its of &s;everal neigh|bouring families, formerly intimate with Madame Montoni, who came to condole with Emily on her death, to congratulate her upon the acqui&s;ition of the&s;e e&s;tates, and to inquire about Mon|toni, and concerning the &s;trange reports they had heard of her own &s;ituation; all which was done with the utmo&s;t decorum, and the vi&s;itors departed with as much compo&s;ure as they had arrived.</P>
<P>Emily was wearied by the&s;e formalities, and di&s;gu&s;ted by the &s;ub&s;ervient manners of many per&s;ons, who had thought her &s;carcely worthy of common attention, while &s;he was believed to be a dependant of Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid &s;he, "there is &s;ome magic in wealth, which can thus make per&s;ons pay their court to it, when it does not even bene|fit them&s;elves. How &s;trange it is that a fool or a knave, with riches, &s;hould be treated with more re&s;pect by the world, than a good man, or a wi&s;e man in poverty!"</P>
<P>It was evening, before &s;he was left alone, and &s;he then wi&s;hed to have refre&s;hed her &s;pirits, in the free air of her garden; but
<PB N="148" REF="029378_0301_0FE087791BC95B88">
&s;he feared to go thither, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould meet again the per&s;on, whom &s;he had &s;een on the preceding night, and he &s;hould prove to be Valancourt. The &s;u&s;pen&s;e and anxiety &s;he &s;uffered, on this &s;ubject, &s;he found all her efforts unable to controul, and her &s;ecret wi&s;h to &s;ee Valancourt once more, though un&s;een by him, powerfully prompted her to go, but prudence and a delicate pride re&s;trained her, and &s;he determined to avoid the po&s;&s;ibility of throwing her&s;elf in his way, by forbearing to vi&s;it the gar|dens, for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>When, after near a week, &s;he again ventured thither, &s;he made Annette her companion, and confined her walk to the low|er grounds, but often &s;tarted as the leaves ru&s;tled in the breeze, imagining, that &s;ome per&s;on was among the thickets; and, at the turn of every alley, &s;he looked forward with apprehen|&s;ive expectation. She pur&s;ued her walk thoughtfully and &s;ilent|ly, for her agitation would not &s;uffer her to conver&s;e with An|nette, to whom, however, thought and &s;ilence were &s;o intolera|ble, that &s;he did not &s;cruple at length to talk to her mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Dear madam," &s;aid &s;he, "why do you &s;tart &s;o? one would think you knew what has happened."</P>
<P>"What has happened?" &s;aid Emily in a faltering voice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> trying to command her emotion.</P>
<P>"The night before la&s;t, you know, madam"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I know nothing, Annette," replied her lady in a more hur|ried voice.</P>
<P>"The night before la&s;t, madam, there was a robber in the garden."</P>
<P>"A robber," &s;aid Emily, in an eager, yet doubting tone.</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e he was a robber, madam. What el&s;e could he he?"</P>
<P>"Where did you &s;ee him, Annette?" rejoined Emily, look|ing round her, and turning back towards the chateau.</P>
<P>"It was not I that &s;aw him, madam, it was Jean the garden|er. It was twelve o'clock at night, and as he was coming acro&s;s the court to go the back way into the hou&s;e, what &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ee&mdash;but &s;omebody walking in the avenue, that fronts the garden gate! So, with that, Jean gue&s;&s;ed how it was, and he went into the hou&s;e for his gun."</P>
<P>"His gun!" exclaimed Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, his gun; and then he came out into the court to watch him, pre&s;ently he &s;ees him come &s;lowly down the avenue, and lean over the garden gate, and look up at the hou&s;e for a long time; and I warrant he examined it well, and &s;ettled what window he &s;hould break in at."</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="029378_0301_0FE087791BC95B88">
"But the gun," &s;aid Emily&mdash;"the gun!"</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, all in good time. Pre&s;ently, Jean &s;ays, the robber opened the gate, and was coming into the court, and then he thought proper to a&s;k him his bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;o he called out again, and bade him &s;ay who he was, and what he wanted. But the man would do neither; but turned upon his heel, and pa&s;&s;ed into the garden again. Jean knew then well enough how it was, and &s;o he fired after him."</P>
<P>"Fired!" exclaimed Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, fired off his gun; but, Holy Virgin! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat makes you look &s;o pale, madam? The man was not killed,&mdash;I dare &s;ay; but if he was, his comrades carried him off: for when Jean went in the morning, to look for the body, it was gone, and nothing to be &s;een but a track of blood on the ground. Jean followed it, that he might find out where the man got into the garden, but it was lo&s;t in the gra&s;s, and"&mdash;</P>
<P>Annette was interrupted: for Emily's &s;pirits died away, and &s;he would have fallen to the ground, if the girl had not caught her, and &s;upported her to a bench, clo&s;e to them.</P>
<P>When, after a long ab&s;ence, her &s;en&s;es returned, Emily de&s;ir|ed to be led to her apartment; and, though &s;he trembled with anxiety to inquire further on the &s;ubject of her alarm, &s;he found her&s;elf too ill at pre&s;ent, to dare the intelligence which it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might receive of Valancourt. Having di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed Annette, that &s;he might weep and think at liberty, &s;he endeavoured to recollect the exact air of the per&s;on, whom &s;he had &s;een on the terrace, and &s;till her fancy gave her the figure of Valancourt. She had, indeed, &s;carcely a doubt, that it was he whom &s;he had &s;een, and at whom the gardener had fired: for the manner of the latter per&s;on, as de&s;cribed by Annette, was not that of a robber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor did it appear probable, that a robber would have come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to break into a hou&s;e &s;o &s;pacious as this.</P>
<P>When Emily thought her&s;elf &s;ufficiently recovered, to li&s;ten to what Jean might have to relate, &s;he &s;ent for him; but he could inform her of no circum&s;tance, that might lead to a knowl|edge of the per&s;on, who had been &s;hot, or of the con&s;equence of the wound; and, after &s;everely reprimanding him, for having fired with bullets, and ordering diligent inquiry to be made in the neighbourhood for the di&s;covery of the wounded per&s;on, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, and her&s;elf remained in the &s;ame &s;tate of terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e. All the tenderne&s;s &s;he had ever felt for Valancourt, was recalled by the &s;en&s;e of his danger; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the more &s;he con|&s;idered the &s;ubject, the more her conviction &s;trengthened, that it
<PB N="150" REF="029378_0302_0FE08785C3188E88">
was he, who had vi&s;ited the gardens, for the purpo&s;e of &s;oothing the mi&s;ery of di&s;appointed affection, amid&s;t the &s;cenes of his former happine&s;s.</P>
<P>"Dear madam," &s;aid Annette, when &s;he returned, "I never &s;aw you &s;o affected before; I dare &s;ay the man is not killed."</P>
<P>Emily &s;huddered, and lamented bitterly the ra&s;hne&s;s of the gardener in having fired.</P>
<P>"I knew you would be angry enough about that, madam, or I &s;hould have told you before; and he knew &s;o too; for, &s;ays he, 'Annette, &s;ay nothing about this to my lady. She lies on the other &s;ide of the hou&s;e, &s;o did not hear the gun, perhaps; but &s;he would be angry with me, if &s;he knew, &s;eeing there is blood. But then,' &s;ays he, 'how is one to keep the garden clear, if one is afraid to fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t a robber, when one &s;ees him?"</P>
<P>"No more of this," &s;aid Emily, "pray leave me."</P>
<P>Annette obeyed, and Emily returned to the agonizing con&s;id|erations, that had a&s;&s;ailed her before, but which &s;he, at length, endeavoured to &s;ooth by a new remark. If the &s;tranger was Valancourt, it was certain he had come alone, and it appeared, therefore, that he had been able to quit the gardens, without a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; a circum&s;tance which did not &s;eem probable, had his wound been dangerous. With this con&s;ideration, &s;he endeavour|ed to &s;upport her&s;elf, during the inquiries, that were making by her &s;ervants in the neighbourhood; but day after day came, and &s;till clo&s;ed in uncertainty, concerning this affair&punc; and Emily &s;uf|fering in &s;ilence, at length, drooped, and &s;unk under the pre&s;&s;ure of her anxiety. She was attacked by a &s;low fever, and when &s;he yielded to the per&s;ua&s;ion of Annette to &s;end for medical advice&punc; the phy&s;icians pre&s;cribed little be&s;ide air, gentle excerci&s;e and a|mu&s;ement: but how was this la&s;t to be obtained? She, however, endeavoured to ab&s;tract her thoughts from the &s;ubject of her anx|iety, by employing them in promoting that happine&s;s in others, which &s;he had lo&s;t her&s;elf; and, when the evening was fine, &s;he u&s;ually took an airing, including in her ride the cottages of &s;ome of her tenants, on who&s;e condition &s;he made &s;uch ob&s;ervations, as often enabled her, una&s;ked, to fulfil their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Her indi&s;po&s;ition, and the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he engaged in, relative to this e&s;tate, had already protracted her &s;tay at Tholou&s;e, beyond the period &s;he had formerly fixed for her departure to La Vallee; and now &s;he was unwilling to leave the only place, where it &s;eemed po&s;&s;ible, that certainty could be obtained on the &s;ubject of her di&s;tre&s;s. But the time was come, when her pre&s;ence was nece&s;|&s;ary at La Vallee, a letter from the Lady Blanche now informing
<PB N="151" REF="029378_0302_0FE08785C3188E88">
her, that the Count and her&s;elf, being then at the chateau of the Baron St. Foix, purpo&s;ed to vi&s;it her at La Vallee, on their way home as &s;oon they &s;hould be informed of her arrival there. Blanche added, that they made this vi&s;it, with the hope of in|ducing her to return with them to Chateau-le-Blanc.</P>
<P>Emily, having replied to the letter of her friend, and &s;aid that &s;he &s;hould be at La Vallee in a few days, made ha&s;ty prepara|tions for the journey; and, in thus leaving Tholou&s;e, endeav|oured to &s;upport her&s;elf with a belief, that, if any fatal accident had happened to Valancourt, &s;he mu&s;t in this interval have heard of it.</P>
<P>On the evening before her departure, &s;he went to take leave of the terrace and the pavilion. The day had been &s;ultry, but a light &s;hower, that fell ju&s;t before &s;un&s;et, had cooled the air, and given that &s;oft verdure to the woods and pa&s;tures, which is &s;o refre&s;hing to the eye; while the rain drops &s;till trembling on the &s;hrubs, glittered in the la&s;t yellow gleam, that lighted up the &s;cene, and the air was filled with fragrance, exhaled by the late &s;hower from herbs and flowers and from the earth it&s;elf. But the lovely pro&s;pect, which Emily beheld from the terrace, was no longer viewed by her with delight; &s;he &s;ighed deeply as her eye wandered over it, and her &s;pirits were in a &s;tate of &s;uch dejection, that &s;he could not think of her approaching return to La Vallee, without tears and &s;eemed&punc; to mourn again the death of her father, as if it had been an event of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Having reached the pavilion, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf at the open l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ttice, and while her eyes &s;ettled on the di&s;tant mountains, that overlooked Ga&s;cony, &s;till gleaming on the horizon, though the &s;un had now left the plains below, "Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, "I return to your long lo&s;t &s;cenes, but &s;hall meet no more the parents, that were wont to render them delightful! no more &s;hall &s;ee the &s;mile of welcome, or hear the well known voice of fondne&s;s:&mdash;all will now be cold and &s;ilent in what was once my happy home."</P>
<P>Tears &s;tole down her cheek, as the remembrance of what that home had been, returned to her; but, after indulging her &s;or|row for &s;ometime, &s;he checked it, accu&s;ing her&s;elf of ingrati|tude in forgetting the friends, that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, while &s;he la|mented tho&s;e that were departed; and &s;he at length, left the pa|vilion and the terrace, without having ob&s;erved a &s;hadow of Valancourt or of any other per&s;on.</P>

<P>ON the following morning, Emily left Tholou&s;e at an early hour, and reached La Vallee about &s;un&s;et. With the melancholy &s;he experienced on the review of a place which had been the re|&s;idence of her parents, and the &s;cene of her earlie&s;t delight, was mingled, after the fir&s;t &s;hock had &s;ub&s;ided, a tender and unde|&s;cribable plea&s;ure. For time had &s;o far blunted the acutene&s;s of her grief, that &s;he now courted every &s;cene, that awakened the memory of her friends; in every room, where &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee them, they almo&s;t &s;eemed to live again; and &s;he felt that La Vallee was &s;till her happie&s;t home. One of the fir&s;t apartments &s;he vi&s;ited, was that, which had been her father's library, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd here &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf in his arm chair, and, while &s;he contemplated, with tempered re&s;ignation, the picture of pa&s;t times, which her memory gave, the tears &s;he &s;hed could &s;carcely be called tho&s;e of grief.</P>
<P>Soon after her arrival, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed by a vi&s;it from the venerable M. Barreaux, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ho came impatiently to welcome the daughter of his late re&s;pected neighbour to her long de&s;erted home. Emily was comforted by the pre&s;ence of an old friend, and they pa&s;&s;ed an intere&s;ting hour in conver&s;ing of former times, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> relating &s;ome of the circum&s;tances, that had occurred to each, &s;ince they parted.</P>
<P>The evening was &s;o far advanced, when M. Barreaux left Emily, that &s;he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> vi&s;it the garden that night; but, on the following morning, &s;he traced its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> regretted &s;cenes with fond impatience; and, as &s;he walked beneath the groves, which her father had planted, and where &s;he had &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> in affectionate conver&s;ation with him, his countenance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s &s;mile, even the accents of his voice, returned with exactne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o her fan|cy, and her heart melted to the tender recollections.</P>
<P>This, too, was his favourite &s;ea&s;on of the year, at which they had often together admired the rich and variegated tints of the&s;e
<PB N="153" REF="029378_0303_0FE0878A7945ED20">
woods and the magical effect of autumnal lights upon the moun|tains; and now, the view of the&s;e circum&s;tances made memory eloquent. As &s;he wandered pen&s;ively on, &s;he fancied the fol|lowing addre&s;s</P>

</LG>
<P>One of Emily's earlie&s;t inquiries, after her arrival at La Val|lee, was concerning There&s;a, her father's old &s;ervant, whom it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay be remembered that M. Que&s;nel had turned from the hou&s;e when it was let, without any provi&s;ion. Under&s;tanding that &s;he lived in a cottage at no great di&s;tance, Emily walked thither, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Approaching, was plea&s;ed to &s;ee, that her habitation was plea&s;|antly &s;ituated on a green &s;lope, &s;heltered by a tuft of oaks, and had an appearance of comfort and extreme neatne&s;s. She found the old woman within, picking vine&s;talks, who on perceiving her young mi&s;tre&s;s, was nearly overcome with joy.</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear young lady!" &s;aid &s;he, "I thought I &s;hould never &s;ee you again in this world, when I heard you was gone to that outlandi&s;h country. I have been hardly u&s;ed, &s;ince you went; I little thought they would have turned me out of my old ma&s;ter's family in my old age!"</P>
<P>Emily lamented the circum&s;tance, and then a&s;&s;ured her, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he would make her latter days comfortable, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;at|isfaction, on &s;eeing her in &s;o plea&s;ant an habitation.</P>
<P>There&s;a thanked her with tears, adding, "Yes, mademoi&s;elle, it is a very comfortable home, thanks to the kind friend
<PB N="154" REF="029378_0304_0FE0879601ACBDD0">
who took me out of my di&s;tre&s;s, when you was too far off to help me, and placed me here! I little thought!&mdash;but no more of that&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And who was this kind friend?" &s;aid Emily: "whoever it was, I &s;hall con&s;ider him as mine al&s;o."</P>
<P>"Ah mademoi&s;elle! that friend forbade me to blazon the good deed&mdash;I mu&s;t not &s;ay, who it was. But how you are al|tered &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t! You look &s;o pale now, and &s;o thin, too; but then, there is my old ma&s;ter's &s;mile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Yes, that will never leave you, any more than the goodne&s;s, that u&s;ed to make him &s;mile. Alas-a-day! the poor lo&s;t a friend indeed, when he died!"</P>
<P>Emily was affected by this mention of her father, which The|re&s;a ob&s;erving, changed the &s;ubject. "I heard, mademoi&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he, "that Madame Cheron married a foreign gentleman, after all, and took you abroad how does &s;he do?"</P>
<P>Emily now mentioned her death. "Alas!" &s;aid There&s;a, "if &s;he had not been my ma&s;ter's &s;i&s;ter, I &s;hould never have loved her; &s;he was always &s;o cro&s;s. But how does that dear young gentleman do, M. Valancourt? he was an hand&s;ome youth, and a good one; is he well, mademoi&s;elle?"</P>
<P>Emily was much agitated.</P>
<P>"A ble&s;&s;ing on him!" continued There&s;a. Ah, my dear young lady, you need not look &s;o &s;hy; I know all about it. Do you think that I do not know that he loves you?

"Ah! how he did love to talk of you! I loved him for that. Nay, for that matter, he liked to hear me talk, for he did not &s;ay much him&s;elf.

<P>"Meet no more!&mdash;not well be&s;towed!" exclaimed There&s;a. "What do I hear?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MEANWHILE Count De Villefort and Lady Blanche had pa&s;&s;ed a plea&s;ant fortnight at the chateau de St. Foix, with the Baron and Barone&s;s, during which they made frequent excur|&s;ions among the mountains, and were delighted with the romantic wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dne&s;s of Pyrenean &s;cenery. It was with regret, that the Count bade adieu to his old friends, although with the hope of being &s;oon united with them in one family; for it was &s;ettled, that M. St. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix, who now attended them into Ga&s;cony, &s;hould receive the hand of the Lady Blanche, upon their arrival at Chateau-le-Blanc. As the road, from the Baron's re&s;idence to La Vallee, was over &s;ome of the wilde&s;t tract of the Pyrenees, and where a carriage wheel had never pa&s;&s;ed, the Count hired mules for him|&s;elf and his family, as well as a couple of &s;tout guides, who were well armed, informed of all the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the mountains, and who boa&s;ted, too, that they were acquainted with every brake and dingle in the way, could tell the names of all the highe&s;t points of this chain of Alps. knew every fore&s;t, that &s;pread along their narrow vallies, the &s;hallowe&s;t part of every torrent they mu&s;t cro&s;s, and the exact di&s;tance of every goat-herd's and hun|ter's cabin they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to pa&s;s,&mdash;which la&s;t article of learning required no very capacious memory, for even &s;uch &s;imple inhabitants were but thinly &s;cattered over the&s;e wilds.</P>
<P>The Count left the chateau de St. Foix, early in the morning, with an intention of pa&s;&s;ing the night at a little inn upon the mountains, about half way to La Vallee, of which his guides had informed him; and, though this was frequented chiefly by Spani&s;h muleteers, on their rou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> France, and, of cour&s;e, would afford only &s;orry accommodation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Count had no alter|native, for it was the only place like an inn, on the road.</P>
<P>After a day of admiration and fatigue, the travellers found them&s;elves about &s;un&s;et, in a woody valley, overlooked, on every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, by abrupt heights. They had proceeded for many leagues, without &s;eeing a human habitation, and had only heard, now and then, at a di&s;tance, the melancholy tinkling of a &s;heep-bell; but now they caught the notes of merry mu&s;ic, and pre&s;ently &s;aw,
<PB N="158" REF="029378_0306_0FE087A9C0CD8930">
within a little green rece&s;s among the rocks, a group of moun|taineers, tripping through a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ance. The Count, who could not look upon the happine&s;s, any more than on the mi&s;ery of others, with indifference, halted to enjoy this &s;cene of &s;imple plea&s;ure. The group before him con&s;i&s;ted of French and Spani&s;h pea&s;ants, the inhabitants of a neighbouring hamlet, &s;ome of whom were performing a &s;prightly dance, the women with ca&s;tanets in their hands, to the &s;ounds of a lute and a tamborine, till, from the bri&s;k melody of France, the mu&s;ic &s;oftened into a &s;low move|ment, to which two female pea&s;ants danced a Spani&s;h Pavan.</P>
<P>The Count, comparing this with the &s;cenes of &s;uch gaiety a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had witne&s;&s;ed at Paris, where fal&s;e ta&s;te painted the features, and, while it vainly tried to &s;upply the glow of nature, concealed the charms of animation&mdash;where affectation &s;o often di&s;torted the air, and vice perverted the manners&mdash;&s;ighed to think, that natu|ral graces and innocent plea&s;ures flouri&s;hed in the wilds of &s;oli|tude, while they drooped amid&s;t the concour&s;e of poli&s;hed &s;oci|ety. But the lengthening &s;hadows reminded the travellers, that they had no time to lo&s;e; and, leaving this joyous group, they pur&s;ued their way towards the little inn, which was to &s;helter them from the night.</P>
<P>The rays of the &s;etting &s;un now threw a yellow gleam upon the fore&s;ts of pine and che&s;nut, that &s;wept down the lower region of the mountains, and gave re&s;plendent tints to the &s;nowy points above. But &s;oon, even this light faded fa&s;t, and the &s;cenery a&s;|&s;umed a more tremenduous appearance, inve&s;ted with the ob&s;cu|rity of twilight. Where the torrent had been &s;een, it was now only heard; where the wild cliffs had di&s;played every variety of form and attitude a dark ma&s;s of mountains now alone appeared; and the vale, which far, far below had opened its dreadful cha&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, the eye could no longer fathom. A melancholy gleam &s;till lin|gered on the &s;ummits of the highe&s;t Alps, overlooking the deep repo&s;e of evening, and &s;eeming to make the &s;tillne&s;s of the hour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> awful.</P>
<P>Blanche viewed the &s;cene in &s;ilence, and li&s;tened with enthu&s;i|a&s;m to the murmur of the pines, that extended in dark lines along the mountains, and to the faint voice of the izard, among the rocks, that came at intervals on the air. But her enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;unk into apprehen&s;ion, when, as the &s;hadows deepened, &s;he look|ed upon the doubtful precipice, that bordered the road, as well as on the various fanta&s;tic forms of danger, that glimmered through the ob&s;curity beyond it; and &s;he a&s;ked her father, how far they were from the inn, and whether he did not con&s;ider the
<PB N="159" REF="029378_0306_0FE087A9C0CD8930">
road to be dangerous at this late hour. The Count repeated the fir&s;t que&s;tion to the guides, who returned a doubtful an&s;wer, ad|ding, that when it was darker, it would be &s;afe&s;t to re&s;t till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ro&s;e. "It is &s;carcely &s;afe to proceed now," &s;aid the Count; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e guides a&s;&s;uring him that there was no danger, went on. Blanche, revived by this a&s;&s;urance, again indulged a pen&s;ive plea|&s;ure, as &s;he watched the progre&s;s of twilight gradually &s;preading its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over the woods and mountains, and &s;tealing from the eye every minuter feature of the &s;cene, till the grand outlines of nature alone remained. Then fell the &s;ilent dews, and every wild flower, and aromatic plant, that bloomed among the cliffs, breathed forth its &s;weetne&s;s; then, too, when the mountain-bee had crept into its blo&s;&s;omed bed, and the hum of every little in|&s;ect, that had floated gaily in the &s;unbeam, was hu&s;hed, the found of many &s;treams, not heard till now, murmured at a di&s;|tance. The bats alone, of all the animals inhabiting this region, &s;eemed awake; and, while they flitted acro&s;s the &s;ilent path, which Blanche was pur&s;uing, &s;he remembered the following lines which Emily had given her:</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>TO THE BAT.</HEAD>
<L>From haunt of man, from day's obtru&s;ive glare,</L>
<L>Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hroud'&s;t thee in the ruin's ivv'd tow'r,</L>
<L>Or in &s;ome &s;hadowy glen's romantic bow'r,</L>
<L>Where wizard forms their my&s;tic charms prepare,</L>
<L>Where Horror lurks and ever-boding Care!</L>
<L>But, at the &s;weet and &s;ilent ev'ning hour.</L>
<L>When clos'd in &s;leep is ev'ry languid flow'r,</L>
<L>Thou lov'&s;t to &s;port upon the twilight air,</L>

</LG>
<P>To a warm imagination, the dubious forms, that float, half veiled in darkne&s;s, afford a higher delight, than the mo&s;t di&s;tinct &s;cenery, that the &s;un can &s;hew. While the fancy thus wanders over land&s;capes partly of its own creation, a &s;weet complacency &s;teals upon the mind, and
<Q><L>Refines it all to &s;ubtle&s;t feeling,</L>
<L>Bids the tear of rapture roll.</L></Q></P>
<P>The di&s;tant note of a torrent, the weak trembling of the breeze among the woods, or the far-off &s;ound of a human voice,
<PB N="160" REF="029378_0307_0FE087AE862A5E80">
now lo&s;t and heard again, are circum&s;tances which wonderfully heighten the enthu&s;ia&s;tic tone of the mind. The young St. Foix, who &s;aw the pre&s;entations of a fervid fancy, and felt whatever enthu&s;ia&s;m could &s;ugge&s;t, &s;ometimes interrupted the &s;i|lence, which the re&s;t of the party &s;eemed by mutual con&s;ent to pre&s;erve, remarking and pointing out to Blanche the mo&s;t &s;trik|ing effect of the hour upon the &s;cenery; while Blanche, who&s;e apprehen&s;ions were beguiled by the conver&s;ation of her lover, yielded to the ta&s;te &s;o congenial to his, and they conver&s;ed in a low re&s;trained voice, the effect of the pen&s;ive tranquillity, which twilight and the &s;cene in&s;pired rather than of any fear that they &s;hould be heard. But, while the heart was thus &s;oothed to ten|derne&s;s, St. Foix gradually mingled, with his admiration of the country, a mention of his affection; and he continued to &s;peak, and Blanche to li&s;ten, till the mountains, the woods, and the magical illu&s;ions of twilight were remembered no more.</P>
<P>The &s;hadows of evening &s;oon &s;hifted to the gloom of night, which was &s;omewhat anticipated by the vapours, that, gathering fa&s;t round the mountains, rolled in dark wreathes along their &s;ides; and the guides propo&s;ed to re&s;t, till the moon &s;hould ri&s;e, adding, that they thought a &s;torm was coming on. As they looked round for a &s;pot, that might afford &s;ome kind of &s;helter, an object was perceived ob&s;curely through the du&s;k, on a point of rock, a little way down the mountain, which they imagined to be a hunter's or a &s;hepherd's cabin, and the party, with cau|tious &s;teps, proceeded towards it. Their labour, however, was not rewarded, or their apprehen&s;ions &s;oothed; for, on reaching the object of their &s;earch, they di&s;covered a monumental cro&s;s, which marked the &s;pot to have been polluted by murder.</P>
<P>The darkne&s;s would not permit them to read the in&s;criptio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; but the guides know this to be a cro&s;s, rai&s;ed to the memory of a Count de Beliard, who had been murdered here by a hoard of banditti, that had infe&s;ted this part of the Pyrenees, a few years before; and the uncommon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the monument &s;eemed to ju&s;tify the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it was erected for a per&s;on of &s;ome di&s;tinction. Blanche &s;huddered, as &s;he li&s;tened to &s;ome horrid particulars of the Count's fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, which one of the guides related in a low, re&s;trained tone, as if the &s;ound of his own voice frightened him; but, while they lingered at the cro&s;s, attending to his narrative, a fla&s;h of lightning glanced upon the rocks, thunder muttered at a di&s;tance, and the traveller, now alarmed, quitted this &s;cene of &s;olitary horror, in &s;earch of &s;helter.</P>
<P>Having regained their former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the guides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they pa&s;&s;|ed on, endeavoured to intere&s;t the Count by various &s;tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es of
<PB N="161" REF="029378_0307_0FE087AE862A5E80">
robbery, and even of murder, which had been perpetrated in the very places they mu&s;t unavoidably pa&s;s, with accounts of their own dauntle&s;s courage and wonderful e&s;capes. The chief guide, or rather he, who was the mo&s;t completely armed, drawing forth one of the four pi&s;tols that were tucked into his belt, &s;wore, that it had &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> three robbers within the year. He then brandi&s;hed a cla&s;p-knife of enormous length, and was going to recount the wonderful execution it had done, when St. Foix, perceiving, that Blanche was terrified, interrupted him. The Count, mean|while, &s;ecretly laughing at the terrible hi&s;tories and extravagant boa&s;tings of the man, re&s;olved to humour him, and, telling Blanche in a whi&s;per, his de&s;ign, beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n to recount &s;ome exploits of his own, which infinitely exceeded any related by the guide.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tances he &s;o artfully gave the col|ouring of truth, that the courage of the guides was vi&s;ibly af|fected by them, who continued &s;ilent, long after the Count had cea&s;ed to &s;peak. The loquacity of the chief hero thus laid a&s;leep, the vigilance of his eyes and ears &s;eemed more thorough|ly awakened, for he li&s;tened with much appearance of anxiety, to the deep thunder, which murmured at intervals, and often pau&s;ed, as the breeze, that was now ri&s;ing, ru&s;hed among the pines. But, when he made a &s;udden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before a tuft of cork trees, that projected over the road, and drew forth a pi&s;tol, be|fore he would venture to brave the banditti which might lurk behind it, the Count could no longer refrain from laughter.</P>
<P>Having now, however, arrived at a level &s;pot, &s;omewhat &s;hel|tered from the air, by overhanging cliffs and by a wood of larch, that ro&s;e over a precipice on the left, and the guides being yet ignorant how far they were from the inn, the travellers deter|mined to re&s;t, till the moon &s;hould ri&s;e, or the &s;torm di&s;per&s;e. Blanche, recalled, to a &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ent moment, looked on the &s;urrounding gloom, with terror; but giving her hand to St. Foix, &s;he alighted, and the whole party entered a kind of cave, if &s;uch it could be called, which was only a &s;hallow cavity, formed by the curve of impending rocks. A light being &s;truck, a fire was kindled, who&s;e blaz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> afforded &s;ome degree of cheer|fulne&s;s and no &s;mall comfort, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, though the day had been hot, the night air of this mountainous region was chilling; a fire was partly nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to keep off the wolves, with which tho&s;e wilds were infe&s;ted.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions being &s;pread upon a projection of the rock, the Count and his family partook of a &s;upper, which, in a &s;cene-le&s;s rude, would certainly have been thought le&s;s excellent.
<PB N="162" REF="029378_0308_0FE087BF250C3508">
When the repa&s;t was fini&s;hed, St. Foix, impatient for the moon, &s;auntered along the precipice, to a point, that fronted the ea&s;t; but all was yet wrapt in gloom, and the &s;ilence of night was broken only by the murmuring of woods, that waved far below, or by di&s;tant thunder, and, now and then, by the faint voices of the party he had quitted. He viewed, with emotions of awful &s;ublimity, the long volumes of &s;ulphurous clouds, that floated along the upper and middle regions of the air, and the light|nings, that fla&s;hed from them, &s;ometimes &s;ilently, and, at oth|ers, followed by &s;ullen peals of thunder, which the mountains feebly prolonged. while the whole horizon, and the aby&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which he &s;tood, were di&s;covered in the momentary light. Upon the &s;ucceeding darkne&s;s, the fire, which had been kindled in the cave, threw a partial gleam, illumining &s;ome points of the op|po&s;ite rocks, and the &s;ummits of pine woods, that hung beetling on the cliffs below, while their rece&s;&s;es &s;eemed to frown in deeper &s;hade.</P>
<P>St. Foix &s;topped to ob&s;erve the picture, which the party in the cave pre&s;ented, where the elegant form of Blanche was finely contra&s;ted by the maje&s;tic figure of the Count, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eared by her on a rude &s;tone, and each was rendered more impre&s;&s;ive by the grote&s;que habits and &s;trong features of the guides and other attendants, who were in the back ground of the piece.&mdash;The effect of the light, too, was intere&s;ting; on the &s;urrounding figures it threw a &s;trong, though pale gleam, and glittered on their bright arms; while upon the foliage of a gigantic larch, that impended its &s;hade over the cliff above, appeared a red&punc; du&s;ky tint, deepening almo&s;t imperceptibly into the blackne&s;s of night.</P>

<P>From this romantic reverie he was awakened by the voices of the guides, repeating his name, which was reverbed from cliff to

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">liff, till an hundred tongues &s;eemed to call him; when he &s;oon quieted the fears of the Count and the Lady Blanche, by re|turning to the cave. As the &s;torm however, &s;eemed approaching, they did not quit their place of &s;helter; and the Count &s;eated between his daughter and St. Foix, endeavoured to divert the fears of the former, and conver&s;ed on &s;ubjects, relating to the natural hi&s;tory of the &s;cene, among which they wandered. He &s;poke of the mineral and fo&s;&s;ile &s;ub&s;tances, found in the depths of the&s;e mountains.&mdash;the veins of marble and granite, with which they abounded, the &s;trata of &s;hells, di&s;covered near their &s;ummits, many thou&s;and fathom above the level of the &s;ea, and at a va&s;t di&s;tance from its pre&s;ent &s;hore;&mdash;of the tremenduous cha&s;ms and caverns of the rocks, the grote&s;que form of the mountains, and the various phaenomena, that &s;eem to &s;tamp upon the world the hi&s;tory of the deluge. From the natural hi&s;tory he de&s;cended to the mention events and circum&s;tances, connected with the civil &s;tory of the Pyrenees; named &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable fortre&s;&s;es, which France and Spain had erected in the pa&s;&s;es of the&s;e mountains; and gave a brief account of &s;ome cel|ebrated &s;ieges and encounters in early times, when Ambition fir&s;t frightened Solitude from the&s;e her deep rece&s;&s;es, made her mountains, which before had echoed only to the torrent's roar, tremble with the clang of arms, and, when man's fir&s;t foot&s;teps in her &s;acred haunts had left the print of blood!</P>
<P>As Blanche &s;at attentive to the narrative, that rendered the &s;cenes doubly intere&s;ting, and re&s;igned to &s;olemn emotion, while &s;he con&s;idered that &s;he was on the very ground, once polluted by the&s;e events, her reverie was &s;uddenly interrupted by a &s;ound that came in the wind.&mdash;It was the di&s;tant bark of a watch dog. The travellers li&s;tened with eager hope, and, as the wind blew &s;tronger, fancied that the &s;ound came from no great di&s;tance; and, the guides having little doubt, that it proceeded from the inn they were in &s;earch of, the Count determined to pur&s;ue his way. The moon now afforded a &s;tronger, though &s;till an un|certain light as &s;he moved among broken clouds: and the tra|vellers, led by the &s;ound, recommenced their journey along the brow of the precipice, preceded by a &s;ingle torch, that now con|tended with the moonlight; for the guides, believing they &s;hould reach t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e inn &s;oon after &s;un&s;et, had neglected to provide more. In &s;ilent caution they followed the &s;ound, which was heard but at intervals, and which, after &s;ome time entirely cea&s;ed. The guides endeavoured, however, to point their cour&s;e to the quarter, whence it had i&s;&s;ued, but the deep roaring of a
<PB N="164" REF="029378_0309_0FE087C3F87118C0">
torrent &s;oon &s;eized their attention, and pre&s;ently they came to a tremenduous cha&s;m of the mountain, which &s;eemed to forbid all further progre&s;s. Blanche alighted from her mule, as did the Count and St. Foix, while the guides traver&s;ed the edge in &s;earch of a bridge, which, however rude, might convey them to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and they, at length, confe&s;&s;ed, what the Count had begun to &s;u&s;pect, that they had been for &s;ometime doubtful of their way, and were now certain only, that they had lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance, was di&s;covered a rude and dangerous pa&s;|&s;age, formed by an enormous pine, which thrown acro&s;s the cha&s;m, united the oppo&s;ite precipices, and which had been felled probably by the hunter, to facilitate his chace of the izard, or the wolf. The whole party, the guides excepted, &s;huddered at the pro&s;pect of cro&s;&s;ing this alpine bridge, who&s;e &s;ides afforded no kind of defence, and from which to fall was to die. The guides, however, prepared to lead over the mules, while Blanche &s;tood trembling on the brink, and li&s;tening to the roar of the wa|ters, which were &s;een de&s;cending from rocks above, overhung with lofty pines, and thence precipitating them&s;elves into the deep aby&s;s, where their white &s;urges gleamed faintly in the moon|light. The poor animals proceeded over this perilous bridge with in&s;tinctive caution, neither frightened by the noi&s;e of the cataract, or deceived by the gloom, which the impending foli|age threw athwart their way. It was now, that the &s;olitary torch, which had been hitherto of little &s;ervice, was found to be an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure; and Blanche, terrified, &s;hrinking, but endeavouring to recollect all her firmne&s;s and pre&s;ence of mind, preceded by her lover and &s;upported by her father, followed the red gleam of the torch, in &s;afety, to the oppo&s;ite cliff.</P>
<P>As they went on, the heights contracted, and formed a narrow pa&s;s at the bottom of which, the torrent they had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed, was heard to thunder. But they were again cheered by the bark of a dog, keeping watch, perhaps, over the flocks of the moun|tains, to protect them from the nightly de&s;cent of the wolves. The &s;ound was much nearer than before, and, while they rejoiced in the hope of &s;oon reaching a place of repo&s;e, a light was &s;een to glimmer at a di&s;tance. It appeared at a height con&s;iderably above the level of their path, and was lo&s;t and &s;een again, as if the waving branches of trees &s;ometimes excluded and then ad|mitted its rays. The guides hallowed with all their &s;trength, but the &s;ound of no human voice was heard in return, and, at length, as a more effectual means of making them&s;elves known, they fired a pi&s;tol. But, while they li&s;tened in anxious expec|tation,
<PB N="165" REF="029378_0309_0FE087C3F87118C0">
the noi&s;e of the explo&s;ion was alone heard, echoing among the rocks, and it gradually &s;unk into a &s;ilence, which no friend|ly hint of man di&s;turbed. The light, however, that had been &s;een before, now became plainer, and, &s;oon after, voices were heard indi&s;tinctly on the wind; but, upon the guides repeating the call, the voices &s;uddenly cea&s;ed, and the light di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche was now almo&s;t &s;inking beneath the pre&s;|&s;ure of anxiety, fatigue and apprehen&s;ion, and the united efforts of the Count and St. Foix could &s;carcely &s;upport her &s;pirits. As they continued to advance, an object was perceived on a point of rock above, which the &s;trong rays of the moon then falling on it, appeared to be a watch tower. The Count, from its &s;ituation and &s;ome other circum&s;tances, had little doubt that it was &s;uch, and believing, that the light had proceeded from thence, he endeavoured to reanimate his daughter's &s;pirits by the near pro&s;pect of &s;helter and repo&s;e, which, however rude the ac|commodation, a ruined watch tower might afford.</P>
<P>"Numerous watch towers have been erected among the Py|renees," &s;aid the Count, anxious only to call Blanche's atten|tion from the &s;ubject of her fears; "and the method by which they give intelligence of the approach of the enemy, is, you know, by fires, kindled on the &s;ummits of the&s;e edifices. Sig|nals have thus, &s;ometimes, been communicated from po&s;t to po&s;t along a frontier line of &s;everal hundred miles in length. Then, as occa&s;ion may require, the lurking armies emerge from their fortre&s;&s;es and the fore&s;ts, and march forth to defend, perhaps, the entrance of &s;ome grand pa&s;s, where, planting them|&s;elves on the heights, they a&s;&s;ail their a&s;toni&s;hed enemies, who wind along the glen below, with fragments of the &s;hat|tered cliff, and pour death and defeat upon them. The an|cient forts, and watch towers, overlooking the grand pa&s;&s;es of the Pyrenees, are carefully pre&s;erved; but &s;ome of tho&s;e in in|ferior &s;tations have been &s;uffered to fall into decay, and are now frequently converted into the more peaceful habitation of the hunter, or the &s;hepherd, who after a day of to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, retires hither, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, with his faithful dogs, forgets, near a cheerful blaze, the labour of the chace, or the anxiety of collecting his wandering flocks, while he is &s;heltered from the nightly &s;torm."</P>
<P>"But are they always thus peacefully inhabited?" &s;aid the Lady Blanche.</P>
<P>"No," replied the Count, "they are &s;ometimes the a&s;ylum of French and Spani&s;h &s;mugglers, who cro&s;s the mountains with contraband goods from their re&s;pective countries, and the latter
<PB N="166" REF="029378_0310_0FE087D26251A118">
are particularly numerous, again&s;t whom &s;trong parties of the king's troops are &s;ometimes &s;ent. But the de&s;perate re&s;olution of the&s;e adventurers, who, knowing, that, if they are taken, they mu&s;t expiate the breach of the law by the mo&s;t cruel death, tra|vel in large parties, well armed, often daunts the courage of the &s;oldiers. The &s;mugglers, who &s;eek only &s;afety, never engage, when they can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it; the military, al&s;o, who know, that in the&s;e encounters, danger is certain, and glory almo&s;t un|attainable, are equally reluctant to fight; an engagement, there|fore, very &s;eldom happens, but, when it does, it never concludes till after the mo&s;t de&s;perate and bloody conflict. You are in|attentive, Blanche," added the Count; "I have wearied you with a dull &s;ubject; but &s;ee, yonder, in the moonlight, is the edifice we have been in &s;earch of, and we are fortunate to be &s;o near it, before the &s;torm bur&s;ts."</P>
<P>Blanche, looking up, perceived that they were at the foot of the cliff, on who&s;e &s;ummit the building &s;tood, but no light now i&s;&s;ued from it; the barking of the dog too had, for &s;ometime, cea&s;ed, and the guides began to doubt, whether this was really the object of their &s;earch. From the di&s;tance, at which they &s;urveyed it, &s;hewn imperfectly by a cloudy moon, it appeared to be of more extent than a &s;ingle watch tower; but the difficulty was how to a&s;cend the height, who&s;e abrupt declivities &s;eemed to afford no kind of path way.</P>
<P>While the guides carried forward the torch to examine the cliff, the Count, remaining with Blanche and St. Foix at its foot, under the &s;hadow of the woods, endeavoured again to beguile the time by conver&s;ation, but again anxiety ab&s;tracted the mind of Blanche; and he then con&s;ulted, apart with St. Foix, whe|ther, it would be advi&s;able, &s;hould a path be found, to venture to an edifice, which might po&s;&s;ibly harbour banditti. They con|&s;idered, that their own party was not &s;mall, and that &s;everal of them were well armed; and, after enumerating the dangers, to be incurred by pa&s;&s;ing the night in the open wild, expo&s;ed, per|haps, to the effects of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;torm, there remained not a doubt, that they ought to endeavour to obtain admittance to the edi|fice above, at any hazard re&s;pecting the inhabitants it might harbour; but the darkne&s;s and the dead &s;ilence, that &s;urround|ed it, appeared to contradict the probability of its being in|habited at all.</P>
<P>A &s;hout from the guides arou&s;ed their attention, after which, in a few minutes, one of the Count's &s;ervants returned with in|telligence, that a path was found, and they immediately ha&s;ten|ed
<PB N="167" REF="029378_0310_0FE087D26251A118">
to join the guides, when they all a&s;cended a little winding way cut in the rock among thickets of dwarf wood, and, after much toil and &s;ome danger, reached the &s;ummit, where &s;everal ruined towers, &s;urrounded by a ma&s;&s;y wall, ro&s;e to their view, partially illumined by the moonlight. The &s;pace around the building was &s;ilent, and apparently for&s;aken, but the Count was cautious; "Step &s;oftly," &s;aid he, in a low voice, "while we reconnoitre the edifice."</P>
<P>Having proceeded &s;ilently along for &s;ome paces, they &s;topped at a gate, who&s;e portals were terrible even in ruins, and, after a moment's he&s;itation, pa&s;&s;ed on to the court of entrance, but pau&s;ed again at the head of a terrace, which, branching from it, ran along the brow of a precipice. Over this, ro&s;e the main body of the edifice, which was now &s;een to be, not a watch tower, but one of tho&s;e ancient fortre&s;&s;es, that, from age and neglect, had fallen to decay. Many parts of it, however, appeared to be &s;till entire; it was built of grey &s;tone, in the heavy Saxon-gothic &s;tyle, with enormous round towers, buttre&s;&s;es of proportionable &s;trength, and the arch of the large gate, which &s;eemed to open into the hall of the fabric, was round, as was that of a window above. The air of &s;olemnity, which mu&s;t &s;o &s;trongly have characterized the pile even in the days of its early &s;trength, was now con&s;id|erably heightened by its &s;hattered battlements and half demoli&s;h|ed walls, and by the huge ma&s;&s;es of ruin, &s;cattered in its wide area, now &s;ilent and gra&s;s grown. In this court of entrance &s;tood the gigantic remains of an oak, that &s;eemed to have flouri&s;hed and decayed with the building, which it &s;till appeared frowning|ly to protect by the few remaining branches, leafle&s;s and mo&s;s grown, that crowned its trunk, and who&s;e wide extent told how enormous the tree had been in a former age. This fortre&s;s was evidently once of great &s;trength, and, from its &s;ituation on a point of rock, impending over a deep glen, had been of great power to annoy, as well as to re&s;i&s;t; the Count, therefore, as he &s;tood &s;urveying it, was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, that it had been &s;uffered, ancient as it was, to &s;ink into ruins, and its pre&s;ent lonely and de&s;erted air excited in his brea&s;t emotions of melancholy awe. While he indulged, for a moment, the&s;e emotions, he thought he heard a &s;ound of remote voices &s;teal upon the &s;tillne&s;s, from within the building, the front of which he again &s;urveyed with &s;crutinizing eyes, but yet no light was vi&s;ible. He now deter|mined to walk round the fort, to that remote part of it, whence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e thought the voices had ari&s;en, that he might examine whe|ther any light could be di&s;cerned there, before he ventured to
<PB N="168" REF="029378_0311_0FE087D6FB33C300">
knock at the gate; for this purpo&s;e, he entered upon the ter|race, where the remains of cannon were yet apparent in the thick walls, but he had not proceeded many paces when his &s;teps were &s;uddenly arre&s;ted by the loud barking of a dog with|in, and which he fancied to be the &s;ame, who&s;e voice had been the means of bringing the travellers thither. It now appeared certain, that the place was inhabited, and the Count returned to con&s;ult again with St. Foix, whether he &s;hould try to obtain admittance, for its wild a&s;pect had &s;omewhat &s;haken his former re&s;olution; but, after a &s;econd con&s;ultation, he &s;ubmitted to the con&s;iderations, which before determined him, and which were &s;trengthened by the di&s;covery of the dog, that guarded the fort, as well as by the &s;tillne&s;s that pervaded it. He therefore, ordered one of his &s;ervants to knock at the gate, who was ad|vancing to obey him, when a light appeared through the loop hole of one of the towers, and the Count called loudly, but, re|ceiving no an&s;wer, he went up to the gate him&s;elf, and &s;truck up|on it with an iron pointed pole, which had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to climb the &s;teep. When the echoes had cea&s;ed, that this blow had awakened the renewed barking, and there were now more than one dog,&mdash;was the only &s;ound, that was heard. The Count &s;tepped back, a few paces, to ob&s;erve whether the light was in the tower, and, perceiving, that it was gone, he returned to the por|tal, and had lifted the pole to &s;trike again, when again he fan|cied he heard the murmur of voices within, and pau&s;ed to li&s;ten. He was confirmed in the &s;uppo&s;ition, but they were too remote, to be heard otherwi&s;e than in a murmur, and the Count now let the pole fall heavily upon the gate; when almo&s;t immediately a profound &s;ilence followed. It was apparent, that the people within had heard the &s;ound, and their caution in admitting &s;trangers gave him a favourable opinion of them. "They are either hunters or &s;hepherds," &s;aid he "who like our&s;elves, have proba|bly &s;ought &s;helter from the night within the&s;e walls, and are fearful of admitting &s;trangers, le&s;t they &s;hould prove robbers. I will endeavour to remove their fears." So &s;aying, he called aloud, "We are friends, who a&s;k &s;helter from the night." In a few moments, &s;teps were heard within, which approached, and a voice then inquired&mdash;"Who calls?" "Friends," repeated the Count; "open the gates and you &s;hall know more." Strong bolts were now heard to be undrawn, and a man, armed with a hunting &s;pear, appeared. "What is it you want at this hour?" &s;aid he. The Count beckoned his attendants, and then an&s;wered, that he wi&s;hed to inquire the way to the neare&s;t cabin. "Are
<PB N="169" REF="029378_0311_0FE087D6FB33C300">
you &s;o little acquainted with the&s;e mountains," &s;aid the man, "as not to know, that there is none, within &s;everal leagues? I can|not &s;hew you the way; you mu&s;t &s;eek it&mdash;there is a moon." Saying this, he was clo&s;ing the gate, and the Count was turning away, half di&s;appointed and half afraid, when another voice was heard from above, and, on looking up, he &s;aw a light, and a man's face, at the grate of the portal. "Stay, friend, you have lo&s;t your way?" &s;aid the voice. "You are hunters, I &s;uppo&s;e, lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our&s;elves: I will be with you pre&s;ently." The voice cea&s;ed, and the light di&s;appeared. Blanche had been alarmed by the appearance of the man, who had opened the gate, and &s;he now entreated her father to quit the place; but the Count had ob|&s;erved the hunter's &s;pear, which he carried; and the words from the tower encouraged him to await the event. The gate was &s;oon opened, and &s;everal men in hunters' habits, who had heard above what had pa&s;&s;ed below, appeared, and, having li&s;tened &s;ometime to the Count, told him he was welcome to re&s;t there for the night. They then pre&s;&s;ed him with much courte&s;y, to enter, and to partake of &s;uch fare as they were about to &s;it down to. The Count, who had ob&s;erved them attentively while they &s;poke, was cautious, and &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious; but he was al&s;o weary, fearful of the approaching &s;torm, and of encountering al|pine heights in the ob&s;curity of night; being likewi&s;e &s;omewhat confident in the &s;trength and number of his attendants, he, after &s;ome further con&s;ideration, determined to accept the invitation. With this re&s;olution he called his &s;ervants, who, advancing round the tower, behind which &s;ome of them had &s;ilently li&s;tened to this conference, followed their Lord, the Lady Blanche, and St. Foix into the fortre&s;s. The &s;trangers led them on to a large and rude hall, partially &s;een by a fire, that blazed at its extremity, round which four men, in the hunter's dre&s;s, were &s;eated, and on the hearth were &s;everal dogs &s;tretched in &s;leep. In the middle of the hall &s;tood a large table, and over the fire &s;ome part of an animal was boiling. As the Count approached, the men aro&s;e, and the dogs, half rai&s;ing them&s;elves, looked fiercely at the &s;tran|gers, but, on hearing their ma&s;ters' voices, kept their po&s;tures on the hearth.</P>
<P>Blanche looked round this gloomy and &s;pacious hall; then at the men, and to her father, who, &s;miling cheerfully at her, ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the hunters. "This is an ho&s;pitable hearth," &s;aid he, "the blaze of a fire is reviving after having wandered &s;o long in the&s;e dreary wilds. Your dogs are tired; what &s;uc|ce&s;s have you had?" "Such as we u&s;ually have," replied one

of the men, who had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the hall, "we kill our game <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tolerable certainty." "The&s;e are fellow hunters," &s;aid one of the men who had brought the Count hither, "that have lo&s;t their way, and I have told them there is room enough in the fort for us all." "Very true, very true" replied his companion, "What luck have you had in the chace, brothers? We have killed two izards, and that you will &s;ay is pretty well." "You mi&s;take, friend," &s;aid the Count, "we are not hunters, but tra|vellers; but, if you will admit us to hunters' fare, we &s;hall be well contented, and will repay your kindne&s;s." "Sit down then, brother," &s;aid one of the men: "Jacques, lay more fuel on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re, the kid will &s;oon be ready; bring a &s;eat for the lady too. Ma'am&s;elle, will you ta&s;te our brandy? it is true Barcelona, and as bright as ever flowed from a k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g." Blanche timidly &s;miled, and was going to refu&s;e, when her father prevented her, by taking, with a good humoured air, the gla&s;s offered to his daughter; and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s; St. Foix, who was &s;eated next her, pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and gave her an encouraging look, but her attention was engaged by a man, who &s;at &s;ilently by the fire&punc; ob&s;erving St. Foix, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and earne&s;t eye.</P>
<P>"You lead a jolly life here," &s;aid the Count. "The life of a hunter is a plea&s;ant and a healthy one; and the repo&s;e is &s;weet, which &s;ucceeds to your labour."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied one of his ho&s;ts, "our life is plea&s;ant enough. We live here only during the &s;ummer, and autumnal months; in winter, the plac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> dreary, and the &s;woln torrents, that de&s;cend, from the heights, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;top to the chace."</P>
<P>"'Tis a life of liberty and enjoyment," &s;aid the Count: "I &s;hould like to pa&s;s a month in your way very well."</P>
<P>"We find employment for our guns too," &s;aid a man who &s;tood behind the Count: "here are plenty of birds, of deli|cious flavour, that feed upon the wild thyme and herbs, that grow in the vallies. Now I think of it, there is a brace of birds hung up in the &s;tone gallery; go fetch them, Jacques, we will have them dre&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>The Count now made inquiry, concerning the method of pur|&s;uing the chace among the rocks and precipices of the&s;e romantic regions, and was li&s;tening to a curious detail, when a horn was &s;ounded at the gate. Blanche looked timidly at her father, who continued to conver&s;e on the &s;ubject of the chace, but who&s;e countenance was &s;omewhat expre&s;&s;ive of anxiety, and who often turned his eyes towards that part of the hall neare&s;t the gate. The horn founded again, and a loud halloo &s;ucceeded. "The&s;e

"What cheer, my lads? what cheer?" &s;aid they, as they approached. "What luck?" return|ed their companions: "have you brought home your &s;upper? You &s;hall have none el&s;e."</P>
<P>"Hah! who the devil have you brought home?" &s;aid they in bad Spani&s;h, on perceiving the Count's party, "are they from France, or Spain?&mdash;where did you meet with them?"</P>
<P>"They met with us, and a merry meeting too," replied his companion aloud in good French. "This chevalier, and his party, had lo&s;t their way, and a&s;ked a night's lodging in the fort." The others made no reply, but threw down a kind of knap&s;ack, and drew forth &s;everal brace of birds. The bag &s;ounded heavily as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell to the ground, and the glitter of &s;ome bright metal within, glanced on the eye of the Count, who now &s;urveyed, with a more inquiring look, the man that held the knap&s;ack. He was a tall robu&s;t figure, of a hard counten|ance, and had &s;hort black hair, curling in his neck. In&s;tead of the hunter's dre&s;s, he wore a faded military uniform; &s;andals were laced on his broad legs, and a kind of &s;hort trow&s;ers hung from his wai&s;t. On his head he wore a leathern cap, &s;ome|what re&s;embling in &s;hape an ancient Roman helmet; but the brows that &s;cowled beneath it, would have characterized tho&s;e of the barbarians, who conquered Rome, rather than tho&s;e of a Roman &s;oldier. The Count, at length, turned away his eyes, and remained &s;ilent and thoughtful, till, again rai&s;ing them, he perceived a figure &s;tanding in an ob&s;cure part of the hall, fixed in attentive gaze on St. Foix, who was conver&s;ing with Blanche, and did not ob&s;erve this; but the Count, &s;oon after, &s;aw the &s;ame man, looking over the &s;houlder of the &s;oldier as atten|tively at him&s;elf. He withd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rw his eye, when that of the Count met it, who felt mi&s;tru&s;t gathering fa&s;t upon his mind, but feared to betray it in his countenance, and, forcing his fea|tures to a&s;&s;ume a &s;mile, addre&s;&s;ed Blanche on &s;ome indifferent &s;ubject. When he again looked round, he perceived, that the &s;oldier and his companion were gone.</P>
<P>The man, who was called Jacques, now returned from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gallery. "A fire is lighted there," &s;aid he, "and the birds are dre&s;&s;ing; the table too is &s;pread there, for that place is warmer than this."</P>
<P>His companions approved of the removal, and invited their gue&s;ts to follow to the gallery, of whom Blanche appeared di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="172" REF="029378_0313_0FE087E797B346A8">
and remained &s;eated, and St. Foix looked at the Count, who &s;aid, he preferred the comfortable blaze of the fire he was then near. The hunters, however, commended the warmth of the other apartment, and pre&s;&s;ed his removal with &s;uch &s;eeming courte&s;y, that the Count, half doubting, and half fearful of be|traying his doubts, con&s;ented to go. The long and ruinous pa&s;|&s;ages, through which they went, &s;omewhat daunted him, but the thunder, which now bur&s;t in loud peals above, made it dangerous to quit this place of &s;helter, and he forbore to pro|voke his conductors by &s;hewing that he di&s;tru&s;ted them. The hunters led the way, with a lamp; the Count and St. Foix, who wi&s;hed to plea&s;e their ho&s;ts by &s;ome in&s;tances of familiari|ty, carried each a &s;eat, and Blanche followed, with faltering &s;teps. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on, part of her dre&s;s caught on a nail in the wall, and, while &s;he &s;topped, &s;omewhat too &s;crupulou&s;ly, to di&s;engage it, the Count, who was talking to St. Foix, and nei|ther of whom ob&s;erved the circum&s;tance, followed their con|ductor round an abrupt angle of the pa&s;&s;age, and Blanche was left behind in darkne&s;s. The thunder prevented them from hearing her call, but, having di&s;engaged her dre&s;s, &s;he quickly followed, as &s;he thought, the way they had taken. A light that glimmered at a di&s;tance, confirmed this belief, and &s;he proceed|ed towards an open door, whence it i&s;&s;ued, conjecturing the room beyond to be the &s;tone gallery the men had &s;poken of. Hearing voices as &s;he advanced, &s;he pau&s;ed within a few pa|ces of the chamber, that &s;he might be certain whether &s;he was right, and from thence, by the light of a lamp, that hung from the ceiling, ob&s;erved four men, &s;eated round a table, over which they leaned in apparent con&s;ultation. In one of them &s;he di&s;|tingui&s;hed the features of him, whom &s;he had ob&s;erved, gazing at St. Foix, with &s;uch deep attention; and who was now &s;peak|ing in an earne&s;t, though re&s;trained voice, till, one of his compan|ions &s;eeming to oppo&s;e him, they &s;poke together in a loud and har&s;her tone. Blanche, alarmed by perceiving, that neither her father, or St. Foix were there, and terrified at the fierce counte|nances and manners of the&s;e men, was turning ha&s;tily from the chamber, to pur&s;ue her &s;earch of the gallery, when &s;he heard one of the men &s;ay:</P>
<P>"Let all di&s;pute end here. Who talks of danger? Follow my advice, and there will be none&mdash;&s;ecure <HI>them,</HI> and the re&s;t are an ea&s;y prey." Blanche, &s;truck with the&s;e words, pau&s;ed a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent&punc; to hear more. "There is nothing to be got by the re&s;t," &s;aid one of his companions, "I am never for blood when
<PB N="173" REF="029378_0313_0FE087E797B346A8">
I can help it&mdash;di&s;patch the two others, and our bu&s;ine&s;s is done, the re&s;t may go."</P>
<P>"May they &s;o," exclaimed the fir&s;t ruffian, with a tremendu|ous oath&mdash;"What! to tell how we have di&s;po&s;ed of their ma&s;|ters, and to &s;end the kings troops to drag us to the wheel! You was always a choice advi&s;er&mdash;I warrant we have not yet forgot St. Thomas's eve la&s;t year."</P>
<P>Blanche's heart now &s;unk with horror. Her fir&s;t impul&s;e was to retreat from the door, but, when &s;he would have gone, her trembling frame refu&s;ed to &s;upport her, and having tottered a few paces, to a more ob&s;cure part of the pa&s;&s;age, &s;he was com|pelled to li&s;ten to the dreadful councils of tho&s;e, who &s;he was no longer &s;uffered to doubt, were banditti. In the next moment, &s;he heard the following words, "Why you would not murder the whole <HI>gang?</HI>"</P>
<P>"I warrant our lives are as good as theirs," replied his com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">de. "If we don't kill them they will hang us: better they &s;hould die than we be hanged."</P>
<P>"Better, better," cried his comrades.</P>
<P>"To commit murder is a hopeful way of e&s;caping the gal|lows!" &s;aid the fir&s;t ruffian&mdash;"many an hone&s;t fellow has run his head into the noo&s;e that way, though." There was a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments, during which they appeared to be con&s;idering.</P>
<P>"Confound tho&s;e fellows," exclaimed one of the robbers im|patiently, "they ought to have been here by this time; they will come back pre&s;ently with the old &s;tory, and no booty: if they were here, our bu&s;ine&s;s would be plain and ea&s;y. I &s;ee we &s;hall not be able to do the bu&s;ine&s;s to night, for our numbers are not equal to the enemy, and in the morning they will be for marching off, and how can we detain them without force?"</P>
<P>"I have been thinking of a &s;cheme, that will do," &s;aid one of his comrades; "if we can di&s;patch the two chevaliers &s;ilent|ly, it will be ea&s;y to ma&s;ter the re&s;t."</P>
<P>"That's a plau&s;ible &s;cheme, in good faith," &s;aid another with a &s;mile of &s;corn&mdash;"If I can eat my way through the pri&s;on wall, I &s;hall be at liberty!&mdash;How can we di&s;patch them <HI>&s;ilently?</HI>"</P>
<P>"By poi&s;on," replied his companions.</P>
<P>"Well &s;aid; that will do," &s;aid the &s;econd ruffian, "that will give a lingering death too, and &s;atisfy my revenge. The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall take care how they again tempt our vengeance."</P>
<P>"I knew the &s;on, the moment I &s;aw him," &s;aid the man, whom Blanche had ob&s;erved gazing on St. Foix, "though he does not know me; the father I had almo&s;t forgotten."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="029378_0314_0FE087F630045008">
"Well, you may &s;ay what you will," &s;aid the third ruffian, "but I don't believe he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Baron, and I am as likely to know as any of you, for I was one of them, that attacked him, with our brave lads, that &s;uffered."</P>
<P>"And was not I another?" &s;aid the fir&s;t ruffian, "I tell you he is the Baron; but what does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whether he is or not? &s;hall we let all this booty go out of our hands?

<P>"I am not for that, I am not for that," replied the third rob|ber, "let us make the mo&s;t of them: only, if this is the Baron, I &s;hould like to have a &s;la&s;h the more at him, for the &s;ake of our brave comrades, that he brought to the gallows."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, &s;la&s;h as much as you will," rejoined the fir&s;t man, "but I tell you the Baron is a taller man."</P>
<P>"Confound your quibbling, &s;aid the &s;econd ruffian, "&s;hall we let them go or not? If we &s;tay here much longer, they will take the hint, and march off without our leave. Let them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e who they will, they are rich, or why all tho&s;e &s;ervants?

<P>"Aye, and then there is the picture; did you &s;ee that?

<P>"But how are we to manage this bu&s;ine&s;s?" &s;aid the &s;econd ruffian: "let us talk of that, there is no fear of there being booty enough, but how are we to &s;ecure it?"</P>
<P>"Aye, aye," &s;aid his comrades, "let us talk of that, and remember no time is to be lo&s;t."</P>
<P>"I am &s;till for poi&s;on," ob&s;erved the third, "but con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ider their number; why there are nine or ten of them, and armed too; when I &s;aw &s;o many at the gate, I was not for letting them in, you know, nor you either."</P>
<P>"I thought they might be &s;ome of our enemies," replied the &s;econd, "I did not &s;o much mind numbers."</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="029378_0314_0FE087F630045008">
"But you mu&s;t mind them now," rejoined his comrade, "or it will be wor&s;e for you. We are not more than &s;ix, and how can we ma&s;ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by open force? I tell you we mu&s;t give &s;ome of them a do&s;e, and the re&s;t may then be managed."</P>
<P>"I'll tell you a better way," rejoined the other impatiently, "draw clo&s;er."</P>
<P>Blanche, who had li&s;tened to this conver&s;ation, in an agony, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe, could no longer di&s;|tingui&s;h what was &s;aid, for the ruffians now &s;poke in lowered voices; but the hope, that &s;he might &s;ave her friends from the plot, if &s;he could find her way quickly to them, &s;uddenly reani|mated her &s;pirits, and lent her &s;trength enough to turn her &s;teps in &s;earch of the gallery. Terror, however, and darkne&s;s con|&s;pired again&s;t her, and, having moved a few yards, the feeble light, that i&s;&s;ued from the chamber, no longer even contended with the gloom, and, her foot &s;tumbling over a &s;tep that cro&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age, &s;he fell to the ground.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e &s;tartled the banditti, who became &s;uddenly &s;ilent, and then all ru&s;hed to the pa&s;&s;age, to examine whether any per|&s;on was there, who might have overheard their councils. Blanche &s;aw them approaching, and perceived their fierce and eager looks: but, before &s;he could rai&s;e her&s;elf, they di&s;covered and &s;eized her, and, as they dragged her towards the chamber they had quitted, her &s;creams drew from them horrible threatenings.</P>
<P>Having reached the room, they began to con&s;ult what they &s;hould do with her. "Let us fir&s;t know what &s;he has heard," &s;aid the chief robber. "How long have you been in the pa&s;&s;age, lady, and what brought you there?"</P>
<P>"Let us fir&s;t &s;ecure that picture," &s;aid one of his comrades, approaching the trembling Blanche. "Fair lady, by your leave that picture is mine; come, &s;urrender it, or I &s;hall &s;eize it."</P>
<P>Blanche, entreating their mercy, immediately gave up the miniature, while another of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her, concerning what &s;he had overheard of their conver&s;ation, when, her confu&s;ion and terror too plainly telling what her tongue feared to confe&s;s, the ruffians looked expre&s;&s;ively upon one another, and two of them withdrew to a remote part of the room, as if to con&s;ult further.</P>
<P>"The&s;e are diamonds by St. Peter!" exclaimed the fellow, who had been examining the miniature, "and here is a very pret|ty picture too, faith; as hand&s;ome a young chevalier, as you would wi&s;h to &s;ee by a &s;ummer's &s;un. Lady, this is your &s;pou&s;e, I warrant, for it is the &s;park, that was in your company ju&s;t now."</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="029378_0315_0FE087FB1034DD60">
Blanche, &s;inking with terror, conjured him to have pity on her, and, delivering him her pur&s;e, promi&s;ed to &s;ay nothing of what had pa&s;&s;ed, if he would &s;uffer her to return to her friends.</P>
<P>He &s;miled ironically, and was going to reply, when his atten|tention was called off by a di&s;tant noi&s;e; and, while he li&s;tened, he gra&s;ped the arm of Blanche more firmly, as if he feared &s;he would e&s;cape from him, and &s;he again &s;hrieked for help.</P>
<P>The approaching &s;ounds called the ruffians from the other part of the chamber. "We are betrayed," &s;aid they; "but let us li&s;ten a moment, perhaps it is only our comrades come in from the mountains, and if &s;o, our work is &s;ure; li&s;ten!"</P>
<P>A di&s;tant di&s;charge of &s;hot confirmed this &s;uppo&s;ition for a moment, but, in the next, the former &s;ounds drawing nearer, the cla&s;hing of &s;words, mingled with voices of loud contention, and with heavy groans, were di&s;tingui&s;hed in the avenue leading to the chamber. While the ruffians prepare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their arms, they heard them&s;elves called by &s;ome of their comrades afar off, and then a &s;hrill horn was &s;ounded without the fortre&s;s, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, it appeared, they too well under&s;tood; for three of them, leaving the Lady Blanche to the care of the fourth, in&s;tantly ru&s;hed from the chamber.</P>
<P>While Blanche, trembling, and nearly fainting, was &s;upplicat|ing for relea&s;e, &s;he heard amid the tumult, that approached, the voice of St. Foix, and &s;he had &s;carcely renewed her &s;hriek, when the door of the room was thrown open, and he appeared, much disfigured with blood, and pur&s;ued by &s;everal ruffians. Blanche neither &s;aw or heard any more; her head &s;wam, her &s;ight failed, and &s;he became &s;en&s;ele&s;s in the arms of the robber, who had detained her.</P>
<P>When &s;he recovered, &s;he perceived, by the gloomy light, that trembled round her, that &s;he was in the &s;ame chamber, but nei|ther the Count, St. Foix or any other per&s;on appeared, and &s;he continued for &s;ometime entirely &s;till, and nearly in a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction. But, the dreadful images of the pa&s;t returning, &s;he endeavoured to rai&s;e her&s;elf, that &s;he might &s;eek her friends, when a &s;ullen groan, at a little di&s;tance, reminded her of St. Foix, and of the condition, in which &s;he had &s;een him enter this room; then, &s;tarting from the floor, by a &s;udden effort of horror, &s;he advanced to the place whence the &s;ound had proceeded, where a body was lying &s;tretched upon the pavement, and where, by the glimmering light of a lamp, &s;he di&s;covered the pale and disfigured countenance of St. Foix. Her horrors, at that mo|ment, may be ea&s;ily imagined. He was &s;peechle&s;s; his eyes
<PB N="177" REF="029378_0315_0FE087FB1034DD60">
were half clo&s;ed, and, on the hand, which &s;he gra&s;ped in the ag|ony of de&s;pair, cold damps had &s;ettled. While &s;he vainly re|peated his name, and called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;teps approached, and a per&s;on entered the chamber, who, &s;he &s;oon perceived was not the Count, her father; but, what was her a&s;toni&s;hment, when &s;up|plicating him to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to St. Foix, &s;he di&s;covered Ludovico! He &s;carcely pau&s;ed to recogni&s;e her, but immediate|ly bound up the wounds of the Chevalier, and, perceiving, that he had fainted probably from lo&s;s of blood, ran for water; but he had been ab&s;ent only a few moments, when Blanche heard other &s;teps approaching, and, while &s;he was almo&s;t frantic with apprehen&s;ion of the ruffians, the light of a torch fla&s;hed upon the walls, and then, Count De Villefort appeared, with an affright|ed countenance, and breathle&s;s with impatience, calling upon his daughter. At the &s;ound of his voice, &s;he ro&s;e, and ran to his arms, while he, letting fall the bloody &s;word he held, pre&s;&s;|ed her to his bo&s;om in a tran&s;port of gratitude and joy, and then ha&s;tily inquired for St. Foix, who now gave &s;ome &s;igns of life. Ludovico &s;oon after returning with water and brandy, the former was applied to his lips, and the latter to his temples and hands, and Blanche, at length, &s;aw him unclo&s;e his eyes, and then heard him inquire for her; but the joy &s;he felt, on this occa&s;ion, was interrupted by new alarms, when Ludovico &s;aid it would be nece&s;&s;ary to remove Mon&s;. St. Foix immediately, and added, "The banditti, that are out, my Lord, were expect|ed home, an hour ago, and they will certainly find us, if we de|lay. That &s;hrill horn, they know, is never &s;ounded by their comrades but on mo&s;t de&s;perate occa&s;ions, and it echoes among the mountains for many leagues round. I have known them brought home by its &s;ound even from the Pied de Melicant. Is any body &s;tanding watch at the great gate, my Lord?"</P>
<P>"Nobody," replied the Count; "the re&s;t of my people are now &s;cattered about I &s;carcely know where. Go, Ludovico, collect them together, and look out your&s;elf, and li&s;ten if you hear the feet of mules."</P>
<P>Ludovico then hurried away and the Count con&s;ulted as to the means of removing St. Foix, who could not have borne the motion of a mule, even if his &s;trength would have &s;upported him in the &s;addle.</P>
<P>While the Count was telling, that the banditti, whom they had found in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort, were &s;ecured in the dungeon, Blanche ob|&s;erved that he was him&s;elf wounded, and that his left arm was
<PB N="178" REF="029378_0316_0FE08808397F15F0">
entirely u&s;ele&s;s; but he &s;miled at her anxiety, a&s;&s;uring her the wound was trifling.</P>
<P>The Count's &s;ervants, except two who kept watch at the gate, now appeared, and, &s;oon after&punc; Ludovico. "I think I hear mules coming along the glen, my Lord," &s;aid he, "but the roaring of the torrent below will not let me be certain; however, I have brought what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill &s;erve the Chevalier," he added, &s;hewing a bear's &s;kin fa&s;tened to a couple of long poles, which had been adapted for the purpo&s;e of bringing home &s;uch of the banditti as happened to be wounded in their encounters. Ludovico &s;pread it on the ground, and, placing the &s;kins of &s;everal goats upon it, made a kind of bed, into which the Chevalier, who was howe|ver now much revived, was gently lifted; and, the poles being rai&s;ed upon the &s;houlders of the guides, who&s;e footing among the&s;e &s;teeps could be&s;t be depended upon, he was borne along with an ea&s;y motion. Some of the Count's &s;ervants were al&s;o wounded&mdash;but not materially, and, their wounds being bound up, they now followed to the great gate. As they pa&s;&s;ed along the hall, a loud tumult was heard at &s;ome di&s;tance, and Blanche was terrified. "It is only tho&s;e villains in the dungeon, my Lady." &s;aid Ludovico. "They &s;eem to be bur&s;ting it open," &s;aid the Count. "No, my Lord," replied Ludovico, "it has an iron door; we have nothing to fear from them; but let me go fir&s;t, and look out from the rampart."</P>
<P>They quickly followed him, and &s;ound their mules brow&s;ing before the gates, where the party li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly, but heard no &s;ound, except that of the torrent below and of the early breeze, &s;ighing among the branches of the old oak, that grew in the court; and they were now glad to perceive the fir&s;t tints of dawn over the mountain tops. When they had mounted their mules, Ludovico undertaking to be their guide, led them by an ea&s;ier path, than that by which they had formerly a&s;cended, into the glen. "We mu&s;t avoid that valley to the ea&s;t, my Lord," &s;aid he, "or we may meet the banditti; they went out that way in the morning."</P>
<P>The travellers, &s;oon after, quitted this glen, and found them|&s;elves in a narrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alley that &s;tretched towards the north-we&s;t. The morning light upon the mountains now &s;trengthened fa&s;t, and gradually di&s;covered the green hillocks, that &s;kirted the winding feet of the cliffs, tufted with cork tree, and ever-green oak. The thunder clouds being di&s;per&s;ed, had left the &s;ky per|fectly &s;erene, and Blanche was revived by the fre&s;h breeze, and by the view of verdure, which, the late rain had brightened.
<PB N="179" REF="029378_0316_0FE08808397F15F0">
Soon after, the &s;un aro&s;e, when the dripping rocks, with the &s;hrubs that fringed their &s;ummits, and many a turfy &s;lope be|low, &s;parkled in his rays. A wreath of mi&s;t was &s;een, floating along the extremity of the valley, but the gale bore it before the travellers, and the &s;unbeams gradually drew it up towards the &s;ummit of the mountains. They had proceeded about a league, when St. Foix having complained of extreme faintne&s;s, they &s;topped to give him refre&s;hment, and, that the men who bore him, might re&s;t. Ludovico had brought from the fort &s;ome fla&s;ks of rich Spani&s;h wine, which now proved a reviving cor|dial not only to St. Foix but to the whole party, though to him it gave only temporary relief, for it fed the fever that burned in his veins, and he could neither di&s;gui&s;e in his countenance the angui&s;h he &s;uffered, or &s;uppre&s;s the wi&s;h, that he was arrived at the inn, where they had de&s;igned to pa&s;s the preceding night.</P>
<P>While they thus repo&s;ed them&s;elves under the &s;hade of the dark green pines, the Count de&s;ired Ludovico to explain &s;hort|ly, by what means he had di&s;appeared from the north apartment, how he came into the hands of the banditti, and how he had contributed &s;o e&s;&s;entia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;erve him, and his family, for to him he ju&s;tly attributed their pre&s;ent deliverance. Ludovico was going to obey him, when &s;uddenly they heard the echo of a pi&s;tol-&s;hot, from the way they had pa&s;&s;ed, and they ro&s;e in a|larm, ha&s;tily to pur&s;ue their route.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY, meanwhile, was &s;till &s;uffering anxiety as to the fate of Valancourt; but There&s;a, having, at length, found a per&s;on, whom &s;he could entru&s;t on her errand to the &s;teward, informed her, that the me&s;&s;enger would return on the following day; and Emily promi&s;ed to be at the cottage, There&s;a being too lame to attend her.</P>
<P>In the evening, therefore, Emily &s;et out alone for the cottage, with a melancholy foreboding, concerning Valancourt, while, perhaps, the gloom of the hour might contribute to depre&s;s her &s;pirits. It was a grey autumnal evening towards the clo&s;e of the
<PB N="180" REF="029378_0317_0FE0698C52C3B218">
&s;ea&s;on; heavy mi&s;ts partially ob&s;cured the mountains, and a chill|ing breeze, that &s;ighed among the beech woods, &s;trewed her path with &s;ome of their la&s;t yellow leaves. The&s;e circling in the bla&s;t and foretelling the death of the year, gave an image of de&s;olation to her mind, and, in her fancy, &s;eemed to announce the death of Valancourt. Of this &s;he had, indeed, more than once &s;o &s;trong a pre&s;entiment, that &s;he was on the point of returning home, feel|ing her&s;elf unequal to an encounter with the certainty &s;he anti|cipated, but, contending with her emotions, &s;he &s;o far command|ed them, as to be able to proceed.</P>
<P>While &s;he walked mournfully on, gazing on the long volumes of vapour, that poured upon the &s;ky, and watching the &s;wallows to&s;&s;ed along the wind, now di&s;appearing among tempe&s;tuous clouds, and then emerging for a moment, in circles upon the calmer air, the afflictions and vici&s;&s;itudes of her late life &s;eemed pourtrayed in the&s;e fleeting images;&mdash;thus had &s;he been to&s;&s;ed upon the &s;tormy &s;ea of misfortune for the la&s;t year, with but &s;hort intervals of peace, if peace that could be called, which was only the delay of evils. And now, when &s;he had e&s;caped from &s;o many dangers, was become independent of the will of tho&s;e, who had oppre&s;&s;ed her, and found her&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of a large for|tune, now, when &s;he might rea&s;onably have expected happine&s;s, &s;he perceived that &s;he was as di&s;tant from it as ever. She would have accu&s;ed her&s;elf of weakne&s;s and ingratitude in thus &s;uffer|ing a &s;en&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ble&s;&s;ings &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to be overcome by that of a &s;ingle misfortune, had this misfortune affected her|&s;elf alone; but, when &s;he had wept for Valancourt even as liv|ing, tears of compa&s;&s;ion had mingled with tho&s;e of regret, and while &s;he lamented a human being degraded to vice, and con&s;e|quently to mi&s;ery, rea&s;on and humanity claimed the&s;e tears, and fortitude had not yet taught her to &s;eparate them from tho&s;e of love; in the pre&s;ent moments, however, it was not the certainty of his guilt, but the apprehen&s;ion of his death (of a death al&s;o, to which &s;he her&s;elf, however innocently, appeared to have been in &s;ome degree in&s;trumental) that oppre&s;&s;ed her. This fear increa&s;|ed, as the means of certainty concerning it approached; and, when &s;he came within view of There&s;a's cottage, &s;he was &s;o much di&s;ordered, and her re&s;olution &s;ailed her &s;o entirely, that, unable to proceed, &s;he re&s;ted on a bank, be&s;ide her path; where, as &s;he &s;at, the wind that groaned &s;ullenly among the lofty branches above, &s;eemed to her melancholy imagination to bear the &s;ounds of di&s;tant lamentation, and, in the pau&s;es of the gu&s;t, &s;he &s;till fan|cied, &s;he heard the feeble and far off notes of di&s;tre&s;s. Attention
<PB N="181" REF="029378_0317_0FE0698C52C3B218">
convinced her, that this was no more than fancy; but the in|crea&s;ing gloom, which &s;eemed the &s;udden clo&s;e of day, &s;oon warn|ed her to depart, and, with faltering &s;teps, &s;he again moved to|ward the cottage. Through the ca&s;ement appeared the cheerful blaze of a wood fire, and There&s;a, who had ob&s;erved Emily ap|proaching, was already at the door to receive her.</P>
<P>"It is a cold evening, madam," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;torms are com|ing on, and I thought you would like a fire. Do take this chair by the hearth."</P>
<P>Emily, thanking her for this con&s;ideration, &s;at down, and then, looking in her face, on which the wood fire threw a gleam, &s;he was &s;truck with its expre&s;&s;ion, and, unable to &s;peak, &s;unk back in her chair with a countenance &s;o full of woe, that There&s;a in|&s;tantly comprehended the occa&s;ion of it, but &s;he remained &s;ilent. "Ah!" &s;aid Emily, at length, "it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to a&s;k the re&s;ult of your inquiry, your &s;ilence, and that look, &s;ufficiently explain it;&mdash;he is dead!"</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear young lady," replied There&s;a, while tears filled her eyes, "this world is made up with trouble! the rich have their &s;hare as well as the poor! But we mu&s;t all endeavour to bear what Heaven plea&s;es."</P>
<P>"He is dead then!" interrupted Emily, "Valancourt is dead!"</P>
<P>"A-well-a-day! I fear he is," replied There&s;a.</P>
<P>"You fear!" &s;aid Emily, "do you only fear?"</P>
<P>"Alas! yes, Madam, I fear he is! neither the &s;teward, or any of the Epourville family, have heard of him &s;ince he left Languedoc, and the Count is in great affliction about him, for he &s;ays he was always punctual in writing, but that now he has not received a line from him, &s;ince he left Languedoc; he ap|pointed to be at home, three weeks ago, but he has neither come, or written, and they fear &s;ome accident has befallen him. Alas! that ever I &s;hould live to cry for his death,! I am old, and might have died without being mi&s;&s;ed, but he"&mdash;Emily was faint, and a&s;ked for &s;ome water, and There&s;a, alarmed by the voice, in which &s;he &s;poke, ha&s;tened to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and, while &s;he held the water to Emily's lips, continued, "My dear young mi&s;tre&s;s, do not take it &s;o to heart; the Chevalier may be alive and well, for all this; let us hope the be&s;t!"</P>
<P>"O no! I cannot hope," &s;aid Emily, "I am acquainted with circum&s;tances, that will not &s;uffer me to hope. I am &s;omewhat better now, and can hear what you have to &s;ay. Tell me, I entreat, the particulars of what you know."</P>
<P>"Stay till you are a little better, mademoi&s;elle, you look &s;adly!"</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="029378_0318_0FE0881B3493AFB0">
"O no. There&s;a, tell me all, while I have the power to hear it," &s;aid Emily, "tell me all, I conjure you!"</P>
<P>"Well, madam, I will then; but the &s;teward did not &s;ay much, for Richard &s;ays he &s;eemed &s;hy of talking about Mon&s;. Valancourt, and what he gathered was from Gabriel, one of the &s;ervants, who &s;aid he had heard it from my lord's gentleman."</P>
<P>"What did he hear?" &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>"Why, madam, Richard has but a bad memory, and could not remember half of it, and, if I had not a&s;ked him a great many que&s;tions, I &s;hould have heard little indeed. But he &s;ays that Gabriel &s;aid, that he and all the other &s;ervants were in great trouble about M. Valancourt, for the he was &s;uch a kind young gentleman, they all loved him, as well as if he had been their own brother&mdash;and now, to think what was become of him! For he u&s;ed to be &s;o courteous to them all and, if any of them had been in fault, M. Valancourt was the fir&s;t to per&s;uade my lord to forgive them. And then, if any poor family was in di&s;|tre&s;s, M. Valancourt was the fir&s;t, too, to relieve them, though &s;ome folks, not a great way off, could have afforded that much better than he. And then, &s;aid Gabriel, he was &s;o gentle to every body, and, for all he had &s;een a noble look with him, he never would command, and call about him, as &s;ome of your quality people do, and we never minded him the le&s;s for that. Nay, &s;ays Gabriel, for that matter, we minded him the more, and would all have run to obey him at a word, &s;ooner than if &s;ome folks had told us what to do at full length; aye, and were more afraid of di&s;plea&s;ing him, too, than of them that u&s;ed rough words to us."</P>
<P>Emily, who no longer con&s;idered it to be dangerous to li&s;ten to prai&s;e be&s;towed on Valancourt, did not attempt to interrupt There&s;a, but &s;at, attentive to her words, though almo&s;t over|whelmed with grief. "My Lord," continued There&s;a, "frets about M. Valancourt &s;adly, and the more, becau&s;e, they &s;ay, he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ather har&s;h again&s;t him lately. Gabriel &s;ays he had it from my Lord's valet, that M. Valancourt had <HI>comported</HI> him|&s;elf wildly at Paris, and had &s;pent a great deal of money, more a great deal than my lord liked, for he loves money better than M. Valancourt, who had been led a&s;tray &s;adly. Nay, for that matter, M. Valancourt had been put into pri&s;on at Paris, and my Lord, &s;ays Gabriel, refu&s;ed to take him out, and &s;aid he de|&s;erved to &s;uffer; and, when old Gregoire, the butler, heard of this, he actually bought a walking &s;tick to take with him to Paris, to vi&s;it his young ma&s;ter; but the next thing we hear is, that
<PB N="183" REF="029378_0318_0FE0881B3493AFB0">
M. Valancourt, is coming home. O, it was a joyful day when he came; but he was &s;adly altered, and my Lord looked very cool upon him, and he was very &s;ad, indeed. And, &s;oon after, he went away again into Languedoc, and, &s;ince that time, we have never &s;een him."</P>
<P>There&s;a pau&s;ed, and Emily, &s;ighing deeply, remained with her eyes fixed upon the floor without &s;peaking. After a long pau&s;e, &s;he inquired what further There&s;a had heard. "Yet why &s;hould I a&s;k?" &s;he added; "what you have already told is too much. O Valancourt! thou art gone&mdash;for ever gone! and I&mdash;I have murdered thee!" The&s;e words, and the countenance of de&s;pair which accompanied them, alarmed There&s;a, who began to fear, that the &s;hock of the intelligence Emily had ju&s;t received, had affected her &s;en&s;es. "My dear young lady, be compo&s;ed," &s;aid &s;he, "and do not &s;ay &s;uch frightful words. You murder M. Valancourt,&mdash;dear heart!" Emily replied only by a heavy &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Dear lady, it breaks my heart to &s;ee you look &s;o," &s;aid There&s;a, "do not &s;it with your eyes upon the ground, and all &s;o pale and melancholy; it frightens me to &s;ee you." Emily was &s;till &s;ilent, and did not appear to hear any thing that was &s;aid to her. "Be&s;ides, mademoi&s;elle," continued There&s;a, "M. Valancourt may be alive and merry yet, for what we know."</P>
<P>At the mention of his name, Emily rai&s;ed her eyes, and fixed them, in a wild gaze upon There&s;a, as if &s;he was endeavouring to under&s;tand what had been &s;aid. "Aye, my dear lady," &s;aid There&s;a, mi&s;taking the meaning of this con&s;iderate air, "M. Valancourt may be alive and merry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et."</P>
<P>On the repetition of the&s;e words, Emily comprehended their import, but, in&s;tead of producing the effect intended, they &s;eem|ed only to heighten her di&s;tre&s;s. She ro&s;e ha&s;tily from her chair; paced the little room, with quick &s;teps, and, often &s;ighing deep|ly, cla&s;ped her hands, and &s;huddered.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, There&s;a, with &s;imple, but hone&s;t affection, en|deavoured to comfort her; put more wood on the fire, &s;tirred it up into a brighter blaze, &s;wept the hearth, &s;et the chair, which Emily had left, in a warmer &s;ituation, and then drew forth from a cupboard a fla&s;k of wine. "It is a &s;tormy night, madam," &s;aid &s;he, "and blows cold&mdash;do come nearer the fire, and take a gla&s;s of this wine; it will comfort you, as it has done me, often and often, for it is not &s;uch wine as one gets every day; it is rich Languedoc, and the la&s;t of &s;ix fla&s;ks that M. Valancourt &s;ent me the night before he left Ga&s;cony for Paris. They have ferved me ever &s;ince, as cordials, and I never drink it, but I think of
<PB N="184" REF="029378_0319_0FE0881FCC5C9CA0">
him, and what kind words he &s;aid to me when he gave them. There&s;a, &s;ays he, you are not young now, and &s;hould have a gla&s;s of good wine, now and then. I will &s;end you a few fla&s;ks, and, when you ta&s;te them, you will &s;ometimes remember me your friend. Yes, tho&s;e were his very words&mdash;me your friend!" Emily &s;till paced the room, without &s;eeming to hear what The|re&s;a &s;aid, who continued &s;peaking. "And I have remembered him, often enough, poor young gentleman!&mdash;for he gave me this roof for a &s;helter, and that, which has &s;upported me. Ah! he is in heaven, with my ble&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter, if ever &s;aint was!"</P>
<P>There&s;a's voice faltered; &s;he wept and &s;et down the fla&s;k, unable to pour out the wine. Her grief &s;eemed to recall Emily from her own, who went towards her, but then &s;topped, and, having gazed on her, for a moment, turned &s;uddenly away, as if overwhelmed by the reflection, that it was Valancourt, whom&punc; There&s;a lamented.</P>
<P>While &s;he yet paced the room, the &s;till, &s;oft note of an oboe, or flute, was heard mingling with the bla&s;t, the &s;weetne&s;s of which affected Emily's &s;pirits; &s;he pau&s;ed a moment in atten|tion; the tender tones, as they &s;welled along the wind, till they were lo&s;t again in the ruder gu&s;t, came with a plaintivene&s;s, that touched her heart, and &s;he melted into tears.</P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid There&s;a, drying her eyes, "there is Richard, our neighbour's &s;on, playing on the oboe; it is &s;ad enough to hear &s;uch &s;weet mu&s;ic now." Emily continued to weep, without re|plying. "He often plays of an evening," added There&s;a, "and, &s;ometimes, the young folks dance to the &s;ound of his oboe. But, dear young lady! do not cry &s;o; and pray take a gla&s;s of this wine," continued &s;he, pouring &s;ome into a gla&s;s, and handing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to Emily, who reluctantly took it.</P>
<P>"Ta&s;te it for M. Valancourt's &s;ake," &s;aid There&s;a, as Emily lifted the gla&s;s to her lips, "for he gave it to me, you know, madam." Emily's hand trembled, and &s;he &s;plit the wine as &s;he withdrew it from her lips. "For who&s;e &s;ake!&mdash;who gave the wine?" &s;aid &s;he in a faltering voice. "M. Valancourt, dear lady. I knew you would be plea&s;ed with it. It is the la&s;t fla&s;k I have left."</P>
<P>Emily &s;et the wine upon the table, and bur&s;t into tears, while There&s;a di&s;appointed and alarmed, tried to comfort her; but &s;he only waved her hand, entreated &s;he might be left alone, and wept the more.</P>
<P>A knock at the cottage door prevented There&s;a from imme|diately obeying her mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he was going to open it, when
<PB N="185" REF="029378_0319_0FE0881FCC5C9CA0">
Emily, checking her, reque&s;ted &s;he would not admit any per&s;on; but, afterwards, recollecting, that &s;he had ordered her &s;ervant to attend her home, &s;he &s;aid it was only Philippe, and endeavoured to re&s;train her tears, while There&s;a opened the door.</P>
<P>A voice, that &s;poke without, drew Emily's attention. She li&s;tened, turned her eyes to the door, when, a per&s;on now ap|peared, and immediately a bright gleam, that fla&s;hed from the fire, di&s;covered Valancourt!</P>
<P>Emily, on perceiving him, &s;tarted from her chair, trembled, and, &s;inking into it again, became in&s;en&s;ible to all around her.</P>
<P>A &s;cream from There&s;a now told, that &s;he knew Valancourt, whom her imperfect &s;ight, and the du&s;kine&s;s of the place had prevented her from immediately recollecting; but his attention was immediately called from her to the per&s;on, whom he &s;aw, falling from a chair near the fire; and, ha&s;tening to her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, he perceived he was &s;upporting Emily! The various emo|tions, that &s;eized him upon thus unexpectedly meeting with her, from whom he had believed he had parted for ever, and on be|holding her pale and lifele&s;s in his arms&mdash;may, perhaps, be ima|gined, though they could neither be then expre&s;&s;ed, or now de|&s;cribed, any more than Emily's &s;en&s;ations, when, at length, &s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes, and, looking up, again &s;aw Valancourt. The inten&s;e anxiety, with which he regarded her, was in&s;tantly chang|ed to an expre&s;&s;ion of mingled joy and tenderne&s;s, as his eye met hers, and he perceived, that &s;he was reviving. But he could only exclaim, "Emily!" as he &s;ilently watched her recovery, while &s;he averted her eye, and feebly attempted to withdraw her hand; but, in the&s;e the fir&s;t moments which &s;ucceeded to the pangs his &s;uppo&s;ed death had occa&s;ioned her, &s;he forgot every fault, which had formerly claimed indignation, and beholding Valancourt, &s;uch as he appeared, when he won her early affection, &s;he experienced emotions of only tenderne&s;s and joy. This, alas! was but the &s;un&s;hine of a few &s;hort moments; recollec|tions ro&s;e, like clouds, upon her mind, and, darkening the illu&s;ive image, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, &s;he again beheld Valancourt degraded&mdash;Valancourt unworthy of the e&s;teem and tenderne&s;s &s;he had once be&s;towed upon him; her &s;pirits faltered, and, withdrawing her hand, &s;he turned from him to conceal her grief, while he, yet more embarra&s;&s;ed and agitated, remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of what &s;he owed to her&s;elf re&s;trained her tears, and taught her &s;oon to overcome, in &s;ome degree, the emotions of mingled joy, and &s;orrow, that contended at her heart, as &s;he ro&s;e, and, having thanked him for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had given her, bade
<PB N="186" REF="029378_0320_0FE0882CF0C2E130">
There&s;a good evening. As &s;he was leaving the cottage, Valan|court, who &s;eemed &s;uddenly awakened as from a dream, entreat|ed, in a voice that pleaded powerfully for compa&s;&s;ion, a few mo|ments attention. Emily's heart perhaps, pleaded as powerfully, but &s;he had re&s;olution enough to re&s;i&s;t both, together with the clamorous entreaties of There&s;a, that &s;he would not venture home alone in the dark, and had already opened the cottage door, when the pelting &s;torm compelled her to obey their re|que&s;ts.</P>
<P>Silent and embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;he returned to the fire, while Valan|court, with increa&s;ing agitation, paced the room, as if he wi&s;hed, yet feared to &s;peak, and There&s;a expre&s;&s;ed without re&s;traint her joy and wonder upon &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>"Dear heart! &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "I never was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed and overjoyed in my life. We were in great tribulation before you came, for we thought you was dead, and were talking and la|menting about you, ju&s;t when you knocked at the door. My young mi&s;tre&s;s there was crying, fit to break her heart.&mdash;"</P>
<P>Emily looked with much di&s;plea&s;ure at There&s;a, but, before &s;he could &s;peak, Valancourt, unable to repre&s;s the emotion, which There&s;a's imprudent di&s;covery occa&s;ioned, exclaimed, "O my Emily! am I then &s;till dear to you! Did you, indeed, hon|our me with a thought&mdash;a tear? O heavens! you weep&mdash;you weep now!"</P>
<P>"There&s;a, &s;ir," &s;aid Emily, with a re&s;erved air, and trying to conquer her tears, "has rea&s;on to remember you with gratitude, and &s;he was concerned, becau&s;e &s;he had not lately heard of you. Allow me to thank you for the kindne&s;s you have &s;hewn her, and to &s;ay, that, &s;ince I am now upon the &s;pot, &s;he mu&s;t not be further indebted to you."</P>
<P>"Emily!" &s;aid Valancourt, no longer ma&s;ter of his emotions, "is it thus you meet him, whom once you meant to honour with your hand&mdash;thus you meet him, who has loved you&mdash;&s;uf|fered for you?&mdash;Yet what do I &s;ay? Pardon me, pardon me, mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert, I know not what I utter. I have no longer any claim upon your remembrance&mdash;I have forfeited every preten&s;ion to your e&s;teem, your love. Yes! let me not forget that I once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your affections, though to know that I have lo&s;t them, is my &s;evere&s;t affliction. Affliction&mdash;do I call it!&mdash;that is a term of mildne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Dear heart!" &s;aid There&s;a, preventing Emily from reply|ing, "talk of once having her affections! Why, my dear young lady loves you now, better than &s;he does any body in the whole world, though &s;he pretends to deny it."</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="029378_0320_0FE0882CF0C2E130">
"This is in&s;upportable!" &s;aid Emily; "There&s;a, you know not what you &s;ay. Sir, if you re&s;pect my tranquillity, you will &s;pare me from the continuance of this di&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>"I do re&s;pect your tranquillity too much, voluntarily to in|terrupt it," replied Valancourt, in who&s;e bo&s;om pride now con|tended with tenderne&s;s; "and will not be a voluntary intruder. I would have entreated a few moments attention&mdash;yet I know not for what purpo&s;e. You have cea&s;ed to e&s;teem me, and to re|count to you my &s;ufferings will degrade me more, without ex|citing even your pity. Yet I have been, O Emily! I am in|deed very wretched!" added Valancourt, in a voice, that &s;oft|ened from &s;olemnity into grief.</P>
<P>"What! is my dear young ma&s;ter going out in all this rain!" &s;aid There&s;a. "No, he &s;hall not &s;tir a &s;tep. Dear! dear! to &s;ee how gentlefolks can afford to throw away their happine&s;s! Now, if you were poor people, there would be none of this. To talk of unworthine&s;s, and not caring about one another, when I know there are not &s;uch a kind hearted lady and gentleman in the whole province, nor any that love one another half &s;o well, if the truth was &s;poken!"</P>
<P>"Emily, in extreme vexation, now ro&s;e from her chair, "I mu&s;t be gone," &s;aid &s;he, "the &s;torm is over."</P>
<P>"Stay, Emily, &s;tay, mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert!" &s;aid Valan|court, &s;ummoning all his re&s;olution, "I will no longer di&s;tre&s;s you by my pre&s;ence. Forgive me, that I did not &s;ooner obey you, and, if you can, &s;ometimes, pity one, who, in lo&s;ing you&mdash;has lo&s;t all hope of peace! May you be happy, Emily, however wretched I remain, happy as my fonde&s;t wi&s;h would have you!"</P>
<P>His voice faltered with the la&s;t words, and his countenance changed, while, with a look of ineffable tenderne&s;s and grief, he gazed upon her for an in&s;tant, and then quitted the cottage.</P>
<P>"Dear heart! dear heart!" cried There&s;a, following him to the door, "why, Mon&s;ieur Valancourt! how it rains! what a night is this to turn him out in! why it will give him his death; and it was but now you was crying, mademoi&s;elle, becau&s;e he was dead. Well! young ladies do change their minds in a minute, as one may &s;ay!"</P>
<P>Emily made no reply, for &s;he heard not what was &s;aid, while, lo&s;t in &s;orrow and thought, &s;he remained in her chair by the fire, with her eyes fixed, and the image of Valancourt &s;till before them.</P>
<P>"M. Valancourt is &s;adly altered! madam," &s;aid There&s;a, "he looks &s;o thin to what he u&s;ed to do, and &s;o melancholy, and then he wears his arm in a &s;ling."</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="029378_0321_0FE088318D94D650">
Emily rai&s;ed her eyes at the&s;e words, for &s;he had not ob&s;erved this la&s;t circum&s;tance, and &s;he now did not doubt, that Valan|court had received the &s;hot of her gardener at Tholou&s;e; with this conviction her pity for him returning, &s;he blamed her&s;elf for having occa&s;ioned him to leave the cottage, during the &s;torm.</P>
<P>Soon after her &s;ervants arrived with the carriage, and Emily, having cen&s;ured There&s;a for her thoughtle&s;s conver&s;ation to Val|ancourt, and &s;trictly charging her never to repeat any hints of the &s;ame kind to him, withdrew to her home, thoughtful and di&s;|con&s;olate.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Valancourt had returned to a little inn of the vil|lage, whither he had arrived only a few moments before his vi&s;it to There&s;a's cottage, on the way from Tholou&s;e to the chateau of the Count de Duvarney, where he had not been &s;ince he bade adieu to Emily at the Chateau-le-Blanc, in the neighbourhood of which he had lingered for a con&s;iderable time, unable to &s;ummon re&s;olution enough to quit a place, that contained the object mo&s;t dear to his heart. There were times, indeed, when grief and de&s;pair urged him to appear again before Emily, and, regardle&s;s of his ruined circum&s;tances, to renew his &s;uit. Pride, however, and the tenderne&s;s of his affection, which could not long endure the thought of involving her in his misfortunes, at length, &s;o far triumphed over pa&s;&s;ion, that he relinqui&s;hed this de&s;perate de&s;ign, and quitted Chateau-le-Blanc. But &s;till his fancy wandered among the &s;cenes, which had witne&s;&s;ed his early love, and, on his way to Ga&s;cony, he &s;topped at Tholou&s;e, where he remain|ed when Emily arrived, concealing, yet indulging his melancholy in the gardens, where he had formerly pa&s;&s;ed with her &s;o many happy hours; often recurring, with vain regret, to the evening before her departure for Italy, when &s;he had &s;o unexpectedly met him on the terrace, and endeavouring to recall to his memory every word and look, which had then charmed him, the argu|ments he had employed to di&s;&s;uade her from the journey, and the tenderne&s;s of their la&s;t farewel.</P>
<P>In &s;uch melancholy recollections he had been indulging, when Emily unexpectedly appeared to him on this very terrace, the evening after her arrival at Tholou&s;e. His emotions, on thus &s;eeing her, can &s;carcely be imagined; but he &s;o far overcame the fir&s;t promptings of love, that he for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore to di&s;cover him&s;elf, and abrubtly quitted the gardens. Still, however, the vi&s;ion he had &s;een haunted his mind; he became more wretched than before, and the only &s;olace of his &s;orrow was to return in the &s;ilence of the night; to follow the paths which he believed her &s;teps had
<PB N="189" REF="029378_0321_0FE088318D94D650">
pre&s;&s;ed, during the day; and, to watch round the habitation where &s;he repo&s;ed. It was in one of the&s;e mournful wanderings, that he had received by the fire of the gardener, who mi&s;took him for a robber, a wound in his arm, which had detained him at Tholou&s;e till very lately, under the hands of a &s;urgeon. There, regardle&s;s of him&s;elf and carele&s;s of his friends, who&s;e late un|kindne&s;s had urged him to believe, that they were indifferent as to his fate, he remained, without informing them of his &s;itua|tion; and now, being &s;ufficiently recovered to bear travelling, he had taken La Vallee in his way to E&s;tuviere, the Count's re&s;idence, partly for the purpo&s;e of hearing of Emily, and of be|ing again near her, and partly for that of inquiring into the &s;itu|ation of poor old There&s;a, who, he had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad been deprived of her &s;tipend, &s;mall as it was, and which inquiry had brought him to her cottage, when Emily happened to be there.</P>
<P>This unexpected interview, which had at once &s;hewn him the tenderne&s;s of her love and the &s;trength of her re&s;olution, renew|ed all the acutene&s;s of the de&s;pair, that had attended their for|mer &s;eparation, and which no effort of rea&s;on could teach him, in the&s;e moments, to &s;ubdue. Her image, her look, the tones of her voice, all dwelt on his fancy, as powerfully as they had lately appeared to his &s;en&s;es, and bani&s;hed from his heart every emotion, except tho&s;e of love and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Before the evening concluded, he returned to There&s;a's cot|tage, that he might hear her talk of Emily, and be in the place, were &s;he had &s;o lately been. The joy, felt and expre&s;&s;ed by that faithful &s;ervant, was quickly changed to &s;orrow, when &s;he ob|&s;erved, at one moment, his wild and phren&s;ied look, and, at ano|ther, the dark melancholy that overhung him.</P>
<P>After he had li&s;tened, and for a con&s;iderable time, to all &s;he had to relate, concerning Emily, he gave There&s;a nearly all the money he had about him, though &s;he repeatedly refu&s;ed it, de|claring, that her mi&s;tre&s;s had amply &s;upplied her wants; and then, drawing a ring of value from his finger, he delivered it her with a &s;olemn charge to pre&s;ent it to Emily; of whom he en|treated, as a la&s;t favour, that &s;he would pre&s;erve it for his &s;ake, and &s;ometimes, when &s;he looked upon it remember the unhappy giver.</P>
<P>There&s;a wept as &s;he received the ring, but it was more from &s;ympathy than from any pre&s;entiment of evil; and before &s;he could reply, Valancourt abruptly left the cottage. She followed him to the door, calling upon his name and entreating him to return; but &s;he received no an&s;wer, and &s;aw him no more.</P>

<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the following morning, as Emily &s;at in the parlour ad|joining the library, reflecting on the &s;cene of the preceding night, Annette ru&s;hed wildly into the room, and, without &s;peaking, &s;unk breathle&s;s into a chair. It was &s;ometime before &s;he could an|&s;wer the anxious inquiries of Emily, as to the occa&s;ion of her emotion, but, at length, &s;he exclaimed, "I have &s;een his gho&s;t, madam, I have &s;een his gho&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Who do you mean?" &s;aid Emily, with extreme impatience.</P>
<P>"It came in from the hall, madam," continued Annette, "as I was cro&s;&s;ing to the parlour."</P>
<P>"Who are you &s;peaking of?" repeated Emily," who came in from the hall?"</P>
<P>"It was dre&s;&s;ed ju&s;t as I have &s;een him, often and often," added Annette. "Ah! who could have thought&mdash;"</P>
<P>Emily's patience was now exhau&s;ted, and &s;he was reprimand|ing her for &s;uch idle fancies, when a &s;ervant entered the room, and informed her, that a &s;tranger without begged leave to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>It immediately occurred to Emily, that this &s;tranger was Va|lancourt, and &s;he told the &s;ervant to inform him, that &s;he was engaged, and could not &s;ee any per&s;on. The &s;ervant having de|livered his me&s;&s;age, returned with one from the &s;tranger, urging the fir&s;t reque&s;t, and &s;aying that he had &s;omething of con&s;equence to communicate; while Annette, who had hitherto &s;at &s;ilent and amazed, now &s;tarted up, and crying, "It is Ludovico!&mdash;it is Ludovico!" ran out of the room. Emily bade the &s;ervant follow her, and, if it really was Ludovico, to &s;hew him into the parlour.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, Ludovico appeared, accompanied by An|nette, who, as joy rendered her forgetful of all rules of decorum towards her mi&s;tre&s;s, would not &s;uffer any per&s;on to be heard for &s;ometime but her&s;elf. Emily expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e and &s;atisfac|tion, on &s;eeing Ludovico in &s;afety, and the fir&s;t emotions increa&s;|ed, when he delivered letters from Count De Villefort and the Lady Blanche, informing her of their late adventure, and of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation at an inn among the Pyrenees, where they had
<PB N="191" REF="029378_0322_0FE0883E5702D6B0">
been detained by the illne&s;s of Mon&s;. St. Foix, and the indi&s;po|&s;ition of Blanche, who added, that the Baron St Foix was ju&s;t arrived to attend his &s;on to his chateau, where he would remain till the perfect recovery of his wounds, and then return to Lan|guedoc, but that her father and her&s;elf purpo&s;ed to be at La Val|lee, on the following day. She added, that Emily's pre&s;ence would be expected at the approaching nuptials, and begged &s;he would be prepared to proceed, in a few days, to Chateau-le-Blanc. For an account of Ludovico's adventure, &s;he referred her to him&s;elf; and Emily, though much intere&s;ted, concern|ing the means, by which he had di&s;appeared from the north apartments, had the forbearance to &s;u&s;pend the gratification of her curio&s;ity, till he had taken &s;ome refre&s;hment, and had con|ver&s;ed with Annette, who&s;e joy, on &s;eeing him in &s;afety, could not have been more extravagant, had he ari&s;en from the grave.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Emily peru&s;ed again the letters of her friends, who&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem and kindne&s;s were very nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;olations to her heart, awakened as it was by the late interview to emotions of keener &s;orrow and regret.</P>
<P>The invitation to Chateau-le-Blanc was pre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much kindne&s;s by the Count and his daughter, who &s;trengthened it by a me&s;&s;age from the Counte&s;s, and the occa&s;ion of it was &s;o im|portant to her friend, that Emily could not refu&s;e to accept it, nor, though &s;he wi&s;hed to remain in the quiet &s;hades of her na|tive home, could &s;he avoid perceiving the impropriety of re|maining there alone, &s;ince Valancourt was again in the neigh|bourhood. Sometimes, too, &s;he thought, that change of &s;cenery and the &s;ociety of her friends might contribute, more than re|tirement, to re&s;tore her to tranquillity.</P>
<P>When Ludovico again appeared, &s;he de&s;ired him to give a de|tail of his adventure in the north apartments, and to tell by what means he became a companion of the banditti, with whom the Count had found him.</P>
<P>He immediately obeyed, while Annette, who had not yet had lei&s;ure to a&s;k him many que&s;tions, on the &s;ubject, prepared to li&s;ten with a countenance of extreme curio&s;ity, venturing to re|mind her lady of her incredulity, concerning &s;pirits, in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, and of her own &s;agacity in believing in them; while Emily, blu&s;hing at the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her late credulity, ob&s;erv|ed, that, if Ludovico's adventure could ju&s;tify Annette's &s;uper|&s;tition, he had probably not been here to relate it.</P>
<P>Ludovico &s;miled at Annette, and bowed to Emily, and then began as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="029378_0323_0FE08842EC445A08">
"You may remember, madam, that, on the night, when I &s;at up in the north chamber my lord, the Count, and Moo&s;. Henri accompanied me thither, and that, while they remained there, nothing happened to excite any alarm. When they were gone I made a fire in the bed room, and, not being inclined to &s;leep, I &s;at down on the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th with a book I had brought with me to divert my mind. I confe&s;s I did &s;ometimes look round the chamber, with &s;omething like apprehen&s;ion&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O very like it, I dare &s;ay," interrupted Annette, "and I dare &s;ay too, if the truth was known, you &s;hook from head to foot."</P>
<P>"Not quite &s;o bad as that," replied Ludovico, &s;miling, "but &s;everal times, as the wind whi&s;tled round the ca&s;tle, and &s;hook the old ca&s;ements, I did fancy I heard odd noi&s;es, and, once or twice, I got up and looked about me; but nothing was to be &s;een, except the grim figures in the tape&s;try, which &s;eemed to frown upon me, as I looked at them. I had &s;at thus for above an hour," continued Ludovico, "when again I thought I heard a noi&s;e, and glanced my eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the room, to di&s;cover what it came from, but, not perceiving any thing, I began to read again, and, when I had fini&s;hed the &s;tory I was upon, I felt drow&s;y, and dropped a&s;leep. But pre&s;ently I was awakened by the noi&s;e I had heard before, and it &s;eemed to come from that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the chamber, where the bed &s;tood; and then, whether it was the &s;tory I had been reading that affected my &s;pirits, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;trange reports, that had been &s;pread of the&s;e apartments, I don't know, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; when I looked towards the bed again, I fancied I &s;aw a man's face within the du&s;ky <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tains."</P>
<P>At the mention of this, Emily trembled, and looked anxiou&s;ly, remembering the &s;pectacle &s;he had her&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed there with Dorothee.</P>
<P>"I confe&s;s, madam, my heart did fail me, at that infrant," continued Ludovico, "but a return of the noi&s;e drew my atten|tion from the bed, and I then di&s;tinctly heard a &s;ound, like that of a key, turning in a lock, but what &s;urpri&s;ed me more was, that I &s;aw no door where the &s;ound &s;eemed to come from. In the next moment, however, the arras near the bed was &s;lowly lifted, and a per&s;on appeared behind it, entering from a &s;mall door in the wall. He &s;tood for a moment as if half retreating, with his head bending under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which concealed the upper part of his face, except his eyes &s;cowling beneath the tape&s;try as he held it; and then, while he rai&s;ed it higher, I &s;aw the face of another man behind, looking over his &s;houlder. I know not how it was,
<PB N="193" REF="029378_0323_0FE08842EC445A08">
but, though my &s;word was upon the table before me, I had not the power ju&s;t then to &s;eize it, but &s;at quite &s;till, watching them, with my eyes half &s;hut as if I was a&s;leep. I &s;uppo&s;e they thought me &s;o, and were debating what they &s;hould do, for I heard them whi&s;per, and they &s;tood in the &s;ame po&s;ture for the value of a minute, and then, I thought I perceived other faces in the du&s;|kine&s;s beyond the door, and heard louder whi&s;pers."</P>
<P>"This door &s;urpri&s;es me," &s;aid Emily, "becau&s;e I under|&s;tood, that the Count had cau&s;ed the arras to be lifted, and the walls examined, &s;u&s;pecting, that they might have concealed a pa&s;&s;age through which you had departed."</P>
<P>"It does not appear &s;o extraordinary to me, madam," replied Ludovico, "that this door &s;hould e&s;cape notice, becau&s;e it was formed in a narrow compartment, which appeared to be part of the outward wall, and, if the Count had not pa&s;&s;ed over it, he might have thought it was u&s;ele&s;s to &s;earch for a door where it &s;eemed as if no pa&s;&s;age could communicate with one; but the truth was, that the pa&s;&s;age was formed within the wall it&s;elf.&mdash;But, to return to the men, whom I &s;aw ob&s;curely beyond the door, and who did not &s;uffer me to remain long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, con|cerning their de&s;ign. They all ru&s;hed into the room, and &s;ur|rounded me, though not before I had &s;natched up my &s;word to defend my&s;elf. But what could one man do again&s;t four? They &s;oon di&s;armed me, and, having fa&s;tened my arms, and gagged my mouth, forced me through the private door, leaving my &s;word upon the table, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, as they &s;aid, tho&s;e who &s;hould come in the morning to look for me, in fighting again&s;t the gho&s;ts. They then led me through many narrow pa&s;&s;ages, cut, as I fancied, in the walls, for I had never &s;een them before, and down &s;everal flights of &s;teps, till we came to the vaults under|neath the ca&s;tle; and then opening a &s;tone door, which I &s;hould have taken for the wall it&s;elf, we went through a long pa&s;&s;age, and down other &s;teps cut in the &s;olid rock, when another door delivered us into a cave. After turning and twining about, for &s;ometime, we reached the mouth of it, and I found my&s;elf on the &s;ea beach at the foot of the cliffs, with the chateau above. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oar was in waiting, into which the ruffians got, forcing me along with them, and we &s;oon reached, a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, that was at anchor, where other men appeared, when &s;etting me aboard, two of the fellows who had &s;eized me followed, and the other two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">owed back to the &s;hore, while we &s;et &s;ail. I &s;oon found out what all this meant, and what was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e men at the chateau. We landed in Rou&s;illon, and, after lingering &s;everal
<PB N="194" REF="029378_0324_0FE088526DCF4B80">
days about the &s;hore, &s;ome of their comrades came down from the mountains, and carried me with them to the fort, where I re|mained till my Lord &s;o unexpectedly arrived, for they had taken good care to prevent my running away, having blindfolded me, during the journey, and, if they had not done this, I think I never could have found my road to any town, through the wild country we traver&s;ed. After I reached the &s;ort I was watched like a pri&s;oner, and never &s;uffered to go out, without two or three companions, and I became &s;o weary of life, that I often wi&s;hed to get rid of it."</P>
<P>"Well, but they let you talk," &s;aid Annette, "they did not gagg you after they got you away from the chateau, &s;o I don't &s;ee what rea&s;on there was to be &s;o very weary of living; to &s;ay nothing about the chance you had of &s;eeing me again."</P>
<P>Ludovico &s;miled, and Emily al&s;o, who inquired what was the motive of the&s;e men for carrying him off.</P>
<P>"I &s;oon found out, madam," re&s;umed Ludovico, "that they were pirates, who had, during many years, &s;ecreted their &s;poil in the vaults of the ca&s;tle, which, being &s;o near the &s;ea, &s;uited their purpo&s;e well. To prevent detection they had tried to have in believed that the chateau was haunted, and, having di&s;covered the private way to the north apartments, which had been &s;hut up ever &s;ince the death of the lady marchione&s;s, they ea&s;ily &s;uc|ceeded. The hou&s;ekeeper and her hu&s;band, who were the only per&s;ons, that had inhabited the ca&s;tle, for &s;ome years, were &s;o terrified by the &s;trange noi&s;es they heard in the nights, that they would live there no longer; a report &s;oon went abroad, that it was haunted, and the whole country believed this the more read|ily, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it had been &s;aid, that the lady marchione&s;s had died in a &s;trange way, and becau&s;e my lord never would re|turn to the place afterwards."</P>
<P>"But why," &s;aid Emily, "were not the&s;e pirates contented with the cave&mdash;why did they think it nece&s;&s;ary to depo&s;it their &s;poil in the ca&s;tle?"</P>
<P>"The cave, madam," replied Ludovico, "was open to any body, and their trea&s;ures would not long have remained undi&s;|covered there, but in the vaults they were &s;ecure &s;o long as the report prevailed of their being haunted. Thus then, it appears, that they brought at midnight, the &s;poil they took on the &s;eas, and kept it till they had opportunities of di&s;po&s;ing of it to ad|vantage. The pirates were connected with Spani&s;h &s;mugglers and banditti, who live among the wilds of the Pyrenees, and carry on various kinds of traffic, &s;uch as nobody would think of; and
<PB N="195" REF="029378_0324_0FE088526DCF4B80">
with this de&s;perate horde of banditti I remained, till my lord arrived. I &s;hall never forget what I felt, when I fir&s;t di&s;covered him&mdash;I almo&s;t gave him up for lo&s;t! but I knew, that, if I &s;hewed my&s;elf, the banditti would di&s;cover who he was, and probably murder us all, to prevent their &s;ecret in the chateau being detected. I, therefore, kept out of my lord's &s;ight, but had a &s;trict watch upon the ruffians, and determined, if they offered him or his family violence, to di&s;cover my&s;elf, and &s;ight for our lives. Soon after, I overhead &s;ome of them laying a mo&s;t diabolical plan for the murder and plunder of the whole party, when I contrived to &s;peak to &s;ome of my lord's attendants, telling them what was going forward, and we con&s;ulted what was be&s;t to be done; meanwhile my lord, alarmed at the ab&s;ence of the Lady Blanche demanded her, and the ruffians having given &s;ome un&s;atisfactory an&s;wer, my lord and Mon&s;. St. Foix became furious, &s;o then we thought it a good time to di&s;cover the plot, and ru&s;hing into the chamber, I called out, "Treachery! my Lord Count, defend your&s;elf!" His lord&s;hip and the chevalier drew their &s;words directly, and a hard battle we had, but we conquered at la&s;t, as, madam, you are already informed of by my Lord Count."</P>
<P>"This is an extraordinary adventure," &s;aid Emily, "and much prai&s;e is due, Ludovico, to your prudence and intrepidity. There are &s;ome circum&s;tances, however, concerning the north apartments, which &s;till perplex me; but, perhaps, you may be able to explain them. Did you ever hear the banditti relate any thing extraordinary of the&s;e rooms."</P>
<P>"No, madam," replied Ludovico," I never heard them &s;peak about the rooms, except to laugh at the credulity of the old hou&s;ekeeper, who once was very near catching one of the pirates; it was &s;ince the Count arrived at the chateau, he &s;aid, and he laughed heartily as he related the trick he had played off."</P>
<P>A blu&s;h over&s;pread Emily's cheek, and &s;he impatiently de&s;ired Ludovico to explain him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Why, my lady," &s;aid he, "as this fellow was, one night in the bed room, he heard &s;omebody approaching through the next apartment, and not having time to lift up the arras, and unfa&s;ten the door, he hid him&s;elf in the bed ju&s;t by. There he lay for &s;ometime in as great a fright, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;"</P>
<P>"As you was in," interrupted Annette, "when you &s;at up &s;o boldly to watch by your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid Ludovico, "in as great a fright as he ever made any body el&s;e &s;uffer; and pre&s;ently the hou&s;ekeeper and &s;ome
<PB N="196" REF="029378_0325_0FE0885744B7E2C0">
other per&s;on came up to the bed, when he, thinking they were going to examine it, bethought him, that his only chance of e&s;caping detection, was by terrifying them; &s;o he lifted up the counterpane, but that did not do, till he rai&s;ed his face above it, and then they both &s;et off, he &s;aid, as if they had &s;een the devil, and he got out of the rooms undi&s;covered."</P>
<P>Emily could not forbear &s;miling at this explanation of the deception, which had given her &s;o much &s;uper&s;titious terror, and was &s;urpri&s;ed, that &s;he could have &s;uffered her&s;elf to be thus alarmed, till &s;he con&s;idered, that, when the mind has once begun to yield to the weakne&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition, trifles impre&s;s it with the force of conviction. Still, however, &s;he remembered with awe, the my&s;terious mu&s;ic, which had been heard, at midnight, near Chateau-le-Blanc, and &s;he a&s;ked Ludovico if he could give any explanation of it; but he could not.</P>
<P>"I only know, madam," he added, "that it did not belong to the pirates, for I have heard them laugh about it, and &s;ay, they believed the devil was in league with them there."</P>
<P>"Yes, I will an&s;wer for it he was," &s;aid Annette, her countenance brightening. "I was &s;ure all along, that he or his &s;pirits had &s;omething to do with the north apartments, and now you &s;ee, madam, I am right at la&s;t."</P>
<P>"It cannot be denied, that his &s;pirits were very bu&s;y in that part of the chateau," replied Emily, &s;miling. "But I am &s;urpri&s;ed, Ludovico, that the&s;e pirates &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;evere in their &s;chemes, after the arrival of the Count; what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">uld they expect but certain detection?"</P>
<P>"I have rea&s;on to believe, madam," replied Ludovico, "that it was their intention to per&s;evere no longer than was nece&s;&s;ary for the removal of the &s;tores, which were depo&s;ited in the vaults; and it appeared, that they had been employed in doing &s;o from within a &s;hort period after the Count's arrival; but, as they had only a few hours in the night for this bu&s;ine&s;s, and were carrying on other &s;chemes at the &s;ame time, the vaults were not above half emptied, when they took me away. They gloried exceedingly in this opportunity of confirming the &s;uper&s;titious reports, that had been &s;pread of the north chambers, were careful to leave every thing there as they had found it, the better to promote the deception, and frequently, in their joco&s;e moods, would laugh at the con&s;ternation which they believed the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle had &s;uffered upon my di&s;appearing, and it was to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of my betraying their &s;ecret, that they had removed me to &s;uch a di&s;tance. From that period, they con&s;idered the
<PB N="197" REF="029378_0325_0FE0885744B7E2C0">
chateau as nearly their own; but I found from the di&s;cour&s;e of their comrades, that, though they were cautious, at fir&s;t, in &s;hewing their power there, they had once very nearly betrayed them&s;elves. Going, one night, as was their cu&s;tom, to the north chambers to repeat the noi&s;es, that had occa&s;ioned &s;uch alarm among the &s;ervants, they heard, as they were about to unfa&s;ten the &s;ecret door, voices in the bed room. My lord has &s;ince told me, that him&s;elf and M. Henri were then in the apartment, and they heard very extraordinary &s;ounds of lamentation, which it &s;eems were made by the&s;e fellows, with their u&s;ual de&s;ign of &s;preading terror, and my lord has owned, he then felt &s;omewhat more than &s;urpri&s;e; but, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to the peace of his family, that no notice &s;hould be taken, he was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, and enjoined &s;ilence to his &s;on."</P>
<P>Emily, recollecting the change, that had appeared in the &s;pirits of the Count, after the night, when he had watched in the north room, now perceived the cau&s;e of it; and, having made &s;ome further inquiries upon this &s;trange affair, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Ludovico, and went to give orders for the accommodation of her friends on the following day.</P>
<P>In the evening, There&s;a, lame as &s;he was, came to deliver the ring, with which Valancourt had entru&s;ted her, and, when &s;he pre&s;ented it, Emily was much affected, for &s;he remembered to have &s;een him wear it often in happier days. She was however, much di&s;plea&s;ed, that There&s;a had received it, and po&s;itively refu&s;ed to accept it her&s;elf, though to have done &s;o would have afforded her a melancholy plea&s;ure. There&s;a entreated, expo&s;tulat|ed, and then de&s;cribed the di&s;tre&s;s of Valancourt, when he had given the ring, and repeated the me&s;&s;age, with which he had commi&s;&s;ioned her to deliver it; and Emily could not conceal the extreme &s;orrow this recital occa&s;ioned her, but wept, and remained lo&s;t in thought.</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear young lady!" &s;aid There&s;a, "why &s;hould all this be? I have known you from your infancy, and it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed I love you; as if you was my own, and wi&s;h as much to &s;ee you happy. M. Valancourt, to be &s;ure, I have not known &s;o long, but then I have rea&s;on to love him, as though he was my own &s;on. I know how well you love one another, or why all this weeping and wailing?" Emily waved her hand for There&s;a to be &s;ilent, who, di&s;regarding the &s;ignal, continued, "And how much you are alike in your tempers and ways, and, that, if you were married, you would be the happie&s;t couple in the whole province&mdash;then what is there to prevent your marry|ing?
<PB N="198" REF="029378_0326_0FE08861DF629390">
Dear dear! to &s;ee how &s;ome people fling away their hap|pine&s;s, and then cry and lament about it, ju&s;t as if it was not their own doing, and as if there was more plea&s;ure in wailing and weeping, than in being at peace. Learning, to be &s;ure, is a fine thing, but, if it teaches folks no better than that, why I had ra|ther be without it; if it would teach them to be happier I would &s;ay &s;omething to it, then it would be learning and wi&s;dom too."</P>
<P>Age and long &s;ervices had given There&s;a a privilege to talk, but Emily now endeavoured to check her loquacity, and, though &s;he felt the ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;ome of her remarks, did not choo&s;e to explain the circum&s;tances that had determined her conduct to|wards Valancourt. She, therefore, only told There&s;a, that it would much di&s;plea&s;e her to hear the &s;ubject renewed; that &s;he had rea&s;ons for her conduct, which &s;he did not think it proper to mention, and that the ring mu&s;t be returned, with an a&s;&s;urance, that &s;he could not accept it with propriety; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;he forbade There&s;a to repeat any future me&s;&s;age from Va|lancourt, as &s;he valued her e&s;teem and kindne&s;s. There&s;a was afflicted, and made another attempt, though feeble, to intere&s;t her for Valancourt, but the unu&s;ual di&s;plea&s;ure, expre&s;&s;ed in Emily's countenance, &s;oon obliged her to de&s;i&s;t, and &s;he departed in won|der and lamentation.</P>
<P>To relieve her mind in &s;ome degree, from the painful recol|lections, that intruded upon it, Emily bu&s;ied her&s;elf in prepara|tions for the journey into Languedoc, and, while Annette, who a&s;|&s;i&s;ted her, &s;poke with joy and affection of the &s;afe return of Lu|dovico, &s;he was con&s;idering how &s;he might be&s;t promote their happine&s;s, and determined, if it appeared, that his affection was as unchanged as that of the &s;imple and hone&s;t Annette, to give her a marriage portion, and &s;ett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> them on &s;ome part of her e&s;tate. The&s;e con&s;iderations led her to the remembrance of her father's paternal domain, which his affairs had formerly compelled him to di&s;po&s;e of to M. Que&s;nel, and which &s;he frequently wi&s;hed to regain, becau&s;e St. Aubert had lamented, that the chief lands of his ance&s;tors had pa&s;&s;ed into another family, and becau&s;e they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad been his birth-place and the haunt of his early years. To the e&s;tate at Tholou&s;e &s;he had no peculiar attachment, and it was her wi&s;h to di&s;po&s;e of this, that &s;he might purcha&s;e her paternal domains, if M. Que&s;nel could be prevailed on to part with them, which, as he talked much of living in Italy, did not appear very improbable.</P>

<P>ON the following day, the arrival of her friend revived the drooping Emily, and La Vallee became once more the &s;cene of &s;ocial kindne&s;s and of elegant ho&s;pitality. Illne&s;s and the ter|ror &s;he had &s;uffered had &s;tolen from Blanche much of her &s;pright|line&s;s, but all her affectionate &s;implicity remained, and, though &s;he appeared le&s;s blooming, &s;he was not le&s;s engaging than be|fore. The unfortunate adventure on the Pyrenees had made the Count very anxious to reach home, and, after little more than a week's &s;tay at La Vallee, Emily prepared to &s;et out with her friends for Languedoc, a&s;&s;igning the care of her hou&s;e, dur|ing her ab&s;ence, to There&s;a. On the evening, preceding her de|parture, this old &s;ervant brought again the ring of Valancourt, and, with tears, entreated her mi&s;tre&s;s to receive it, for that &s;he had neither &s;een or heard of M. Valancourt, &s;ince the night when he delivered it to her. As &s;he &s;aid this, her countenance expre&s;&s;ed more alarm, than &s;he dared to utter; but Emily, checking her own propen&s;ity to fear con&s;idered, that he had probably return|ed to the re&s;idence of his brother, and, again refu&s;ing to accept the ring, bade There&s;a pre&s;erve it, till &s;he &s;aw him, which, with extreme reluctance, &s;he promi&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>On the following day, Count De Villefort, with Emily and the Lady Blanche, left La Vallee, and, on the en&s;uing evening, arrived at the Chateau-le Blanc, where the Counte&s;s, Henri, and M. Du Pont, whom Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed to find there, received them with much joy and congratulation. She was concerned to ob&s;erve, that the Count &s;till encouraged the hopes of his friend, who&s;e countenance declared, that his affection had &s;uffered no abatement from ab&s;ence, and was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, when, on the &s;econd evening after her arrival, the Count, having withdrawn her from the Lady Blanche, with whom &s;he was walking, re|newed the &s;ubject of M. Du Pont's hopes. The mildne&s;s, with which &s;he li&s;tened to his interce&s;&s;ions at fir&s;t, deceiving him, as to her &s;entiments, he began to believe, that, her affection for Va|lancourt being overcome, &s;he was, at length, di&s;po&s;ed to think fa|vourably of M. Du Pont; and, when &s;he afterwards convinced
<PB N="200" REF="029378_0327_0FE089518044F840">
him of his mi&s;take, he ventured, in the earne&s;tne&s;s of his wi&s;h to promote what he con&s;idered to be the happine&s;s of two per&s;ons, whom he &s;o much e&s;teemed, gently to remon&s;trate with her, on thus &s;uffering an ill placed affection to poi&s;on the happine&s;s of her mo&s;t valuable years.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving her &s;ilence and the deep dejection of her counte|nance, he concluded with &s;aying, "I will not &s;ay more now, but I will &s;till believe, my dear Mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert, that you will not always reject a per&s;on, &s;o truly e&s;timable as my friend Du Pont."</P>
<P>He &s;pared her the pain of replying, by leaving her; and &s;he &s;trolled on, &s;omewhat di&s;plea&s;ed with the Count for having per|&s;evered to plead for a &s;uit, which &s;he had repeatedly rejected, and lo&s;t amid&s;t the melancholy recollections, which this topic had revived, till &s;he had in&s;en&s;ibly reached the borders of the woods, that &s;creened the mona&s;tery of St. Clair, when, perceiving how far &s;he had wandered, &s;he determined to extend her walk a lit|tle farther, and to inquire after the abbe&s;s and &s;ome of her friends among the nuns.</P>
<P>Though the evening was now drawing to a clo&s;e, &s;he accepted the invitation of the friar, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ned the gate, and, anxious to meet &s;ome of her old acquaintan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> proceeded towards the con|vent parlour. As &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the lawn, that &s;loped from the front of the mona&s;tery, towards the &s;ea, &s;he was &s;truck with the picture of repo&s;e, exhibited by &s;ome monks, &s;itting in the cloi&s;|ters, which extended under the brow of the woods, that crowned this eminence; where, as they meditated, at this twilight hour holy &s;ubjects, they &s;ometimes &s;uffered their attention to be re|lieved by the &s;cene before them, not thought it profane to lock at nature, now that it had exchanged the brilliant colour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> for the &s;ober <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ue of evening. Before the cloi&s;ters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pread an ancient che&s;nut, who&s;e ample branches were de&s;igned to &s;creen the full magnificence of a &s;cene, that might tempt the wi&s;h to worldly plea&s;ures; but &s;till, beneath the dark and &s;pread|ing foliage, gleamed a wide extent of ocean, and many a pa&s;&s;ing &s;ail; while, to the right and left, thick woods were &s;een &s;tretch|ing along the winding &s;hores. So much as this had been admit|ted, perhaps, to give to the &s;ecluded votary an image of the dan|gers and vici&s;&s;itudes of life, and to con&s;ole him, now that he had renounced its plea&s;ures, by the certainty of having e&s;caped its evils. As Emily walked pen&s;ively along, con&s;idering how much &s;uffering &s;he might have e&s;caped, had &s;he become a votare&s;s of the order, and remained in this retirement from the time of
<PB N="201" REF="029378_0327_0FE089518044F840">
her father's death, the ve&s;per bell &s;truck up, and the monks retired &s;lowly towards the chapel, while &s;he, pur&s;uing her way, entered the great hall, where an unu&s;ual &s;ilence &s;eemed to reign. The parlour too, which opened from it, &s;he found vacant, but, as the evening bell was &s;ounding, &s;he believed the nuns had withdrawn into the chapel, and &s;at down to re&s;t, for a moment, before &s;he returned to the chateau, where, however, the increa&s;|ing gloom made her now anxious to be.</P>
<P>Not many minutes had elap&s;ed, before a nun, entering in ha&s;te, inquired for the abbe&s;s, and was retiring, without recol|lecting Emily, when &s;he made her&s;elf known, and then learned, that a ma&s;s was going to be performed for the &s;oul of &s;i&s;ter Ag|nes, who had been declining for &s;ometime, and who was now be|lieved to be dying.</P>
<P>Of her &s;ufferings the &s;i&s;ter gave a melancholy account, and of the horrors into which &s;he had frequently &s;tarted, but which had now yielded to a dejection &s;o gloomy, that neither the prayers, in which &s;he was joined by the &s;i&s;terhood, or the a&s;&s;urances of her confe&s;&s;or, had power to recall her from it, or to cheer her mind even with a momentary gleam of comfort.</P>
<P>To this relation Emily li&s;tened with extreme concern, and, recollecting the phren&s;ied manners and the expre&s;&s;ions of horror, which &s;he had her&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed of Agnes, together, with the hi&s;tory, that &s;i&s;ter Frances had communicated, her compa&s;&s;ion was heightened to a very painful degree. As the evening was already far advanced, Emily did not now de&s;ire to &s;ee her, or to join in the ma&s;s, and, after leaving many kind remembrances with the nun, for her old friends, &s;he quitted the mona&s;tery, and returned over the cliffs towards the chateau, meditating upon what &s;he had ju&s;t heard, till at length, &s;he forced her mind upon le&s;s intere&s;ting &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The wind was high, and, as &s;he drew near the chateau, &s;he often pau&s;ed to li&s;ten to its awful &s;ound, as it &s;wept over the billows, that beat below, or groaned along the &s;urrounding woods; and, while &s;he re&s;ted on a cliff at a &s;hort di&s;tance from the cha|teau, and looked upon the the wide waters, &s;een dimly beneath the la&s;t &s;hade of twilight, &s;he thought of the following addre&s;s,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the following evening, the view of the convent towers, ri&s;ing among the &s;hadowy woods, reminded Emily of the nun, who&s;e condition had &s;o much affected her; and, anxious to know how &s;he was, as well as to &s;ee &s;ome of her former friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he and the Lady Blanche extended their walk to the mona&s;tery. At the gate &s;tood a carriage, which, from the heat of the hor&s;es, appeared to have ju&s;t arrived; but a more than common &s;till|ne&s;s pervaded the court and the cloi&s;ters, through which Emily and Blanche pa&s;&s;ed in their way to the great hall, where a nun, who was cro&s;&s;ing to the &s;tairca&s;e, replied to the inquiries of the former, that &s;i&s;ter Agnes was &s;till living, and &s;en&s;ible, but that it was thought &s;he could not &s;urvive the night. In the parlour, they found &s;everal of the boarders, who rejoiced to &s;ee Emily, and told her many little circum&s;tances that had happened in the convent &s;ince her departure, and which were intere&s;ting to her only becau&s;e they related to per&s;ons, whom &s;he had regarded with affection. While they thus conver&s;ed, the abbe&s;s entered the room, and expre&s;&s;ed much &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing Emily, but her manner was unu&s;ually &s;olemn, and her countenance dejected.
<PB N="203" REF="029378_0328_0FE08875548EFC38">
"Our hou&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, after the fir&s;t &s;alutations were over, "is truly a hou&s;e of mourning, a daughter is now paying the debt of nature. You have heard, perhaps that our daughter Agnes is dying?"</P>
<P>Emily expre&s;&s;ed her &s;incere concern.</P>
<P>"Her death pre&s;ents to us a great and awful le&s;&s;on," contin|ued the abbe&s;s; "let us read it, and profit by it; let it teach us to prepare our&s;elves for the change, that awaits us all! You are young, and have it yet in your power to &s;ecure "the peace that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding"&mdash;the peace of con&s;cience. Pre&s;erve it in your youth, that it may comfort you in age; for vain, alas! and imperfect are the good deeds of our latter years, if tho&s;e of our early life have been evil!"</P>
<P>Emily would have &s;aid, that good deeds &s;he hoped, were never vain! but &s;he con&s;idered that it was the abbe&s;s who &s;poke, and &s;he remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"The latter days of Agnes," re&s;umed the abbe&s;s, "have been exemplary; would they might atone for the errors of her for|mer ones! Her &s;ufferings now, alas! are great; let us believe, that they will make her peace hereafter! I have left her with her confe&s;&s;or, and a gentleman, whom &s;he has long been anxi|ous to &s;ee, and who is ju&s;t arrived from Paris. They, I hope, will be able to admini&s;ter the repo&s;e, which her mind has hitherto wanted."</P>
<P>Emily fervently joined in the wi&s;h.</P>
<P>"During her illne&s;s, &s;he has &s;ometimes named you," re&s;umed the abbe&s;s; "perhaps, it would comfort her to &s;ee you; when her pre&s;ent vi&s;itors have left her, we will go to her chamber, if the &s;cene will not be too melancholy for your &s;pirits. But, in|deed, to &s;uch &s;cenes, however painful, we ought to accu&s;tom our|&s;elves, for they are &s;alutary to the &s;oul, and prepare us for what we are our&s;elves to &s;uffer."</P>
<P>Emily became grave and thoughtful; for this conver&s;ation bro't to her recollection the dying moments of her beloved father, and &s;he wi&s;hed once more to weep over the &s;pot, where his remains were bu|ried. During the &s;ilence, which followed the abbe&s;s' &s;peech, many minute circum&s;tances attending his la&s;t hours occurred to her; his emotion on perceiving him&s;elf to be in the neighbourhood of Chateau-la-Blanc&mdash;his reque&s;t to be interred in a particular &s;pot in the church of this mona&s;tery&mdash;and the &s;olemn charge he had delivered her to de&s;troy certain papers, without examining them. She recollected al&s;o the my&s;terious and horrible words in tho&s;e manu&s;cripts, upon which her eye had involuntarily glanced; and, though they now, and, indeed, whenever &s;he remembered them,
<PB N="204" REF="029378_0329_0FE08879E71687E0">
revived an exce&s;s of painful curio&s;ity, concerning their full im|port, and the motives for her father's command, it was ever her chief con&s;olation, that &s;he had &s;trictly obeyed him in this particular.</P>
<P>Little more was &s;aid by the abbe&s;s, who appeared too much affected by the &s;ubject &s;he had lately left, to be willing to con|ver&s;e, and her companions had been for &s;ometime &s;ilent from the &s;ame cau&s;e, when this general reverie was interrupted by the en|trance of a &s;tranger, Mon&s;ieur Bonnac, who had ju&s;t quitted the chamber of &s;i&s;ter Agnes. He appeared much di&s;turbed, but Emily fancied, that his countenance had more the expre&s;&s;ion of horror, than of grief. Having drawn the abbe&s;s to a di&s;tant part of the room, he conver&s;ed with her for &s;ometime, during which &s;he &s;eemed to li&s;ten with earne&s;t attention, and he to &s;peak with caution, and a more than common degree of intere&s;t. When he had concluded, he bowed &s;ilently to the re&s;t of the company, and quitted the room. The abbe&s;s, &s;oon after propo&s;ed going to the chamber of &s;i&s;ter Agnes, to which Emily con&s;ented, though not without &s;ome reluctance, and Lady Blanche remained with the boarders below.</P>
<P>At the door of the chamber they met the confe&s;&s;or, whom, as he lifted up his head on their approach, Emily ob&s;erved to be the &s;ame that had attended her dying father; but he pa&s;&s;ed on without noticing her, and they entered the apartment, where, on a mattre&s;s, was laid &s;i&s;ter Agnes, with one nun watching in the chair be&s;ide her. Her countenance was &s;o much changed, that Emily would &s;carcely have recollected her, had &s;he not been pre|pared to do &s;o: it was gha&s;tly, and over&s;pread with gloomy horror; her dim and hollow eyes were fixed on a crucifix, which &s;he held upon her bo&s;om: and &s;he was &s;o much engaged in thought, as not to perceive the abbe&s;s and Emily, till they &s;tood at the bed &s;ide. Then, turning her heavy eyes, &s;he fixed them in wild horror, upon Emily; and, &s;creaming, exclaimed, "Ah! that vi&s;ion comes upon me in my dying hours!"</P>
<P>Emily &s;tarted back in terror, and looked for explanation to the abbe&s;s, who made her a &s;ignal not to be alarmed, and calmly &s;aid to Agnes, "Daughter, I have brought Mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert to vi&s;it you: I thought you would be glad to &s;ee her."</P>
<P>Agnes made no reply; but, &s;till gazing wildly upon Emily, exclaimed, "It is her very &s;elf! Oh! there is all that fa&s;cina|tion in her look, which proved my de&s;truction! What would you have&mdash;what is it you come to demand&mdash;Retribution?&mdash;It will &s;oon be yours&mdash;it is yours already. How many years have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince la&s;t I &s;aw you! My crime is but as ye&s;terday. Yet I am grown old beneath it; while you are &s;till young and
<PB N="205" REF="029378_0329_0FE08879E71687E0">
blooming&mdash;blooming as when you forced me to commit that mo&s;t abhorred deed! O! could I once forget it!&mdash;yet what would that avail?&mdash;the deed is done!"</P>
<P>Emily, extremely &s;hocked, would now have left the room; but the abbe&s;s, taking her hand, tried to &s;upport her &s;pirits, and beg|ged &s;he would &s;tay a few moments, when Agnes would probably be calm, whom now &s;he tried to &s;ooth. But the latter &s;eemed to di&s;regard her, while &s;he &s;till fixed her eyes on Emily, and added, "What are years of prayers and repentance? they cannot wa&s;h out the foulne&s;s of murder!&mdash;Yes, murder! Where is he&mdash;where is he?&mdash;Look there&mdash;look there!&mdash;&s;ee where he &s;talks along the room! Why do you come to torment me now?" con|tinued Agnes, while her &s;training eyes were bent on air, "why was not I puni&s;hed before?&mdash;O! do not frown &s;o &s;ternly I Hah I there again! 'tis &s;he her&s;elf! Why do you look &s;o piteou&s;ly upon me&mdash;and &s;mile, too? &s;mile on me! What groan was that?"</P>
<P>Agnes, &s;unk down, apparently lifele&s;s, and Emily, unable to &s;upport her&s;elf, leaned again&s;t the bed, while the abbe&s;s and the attendant nun were applying the u&s;ual remedies to Agnes. "Peace," &s;aid the abbe&s;s, when Emily was going to &s;peak, "the delirium is going off, &s;he will &s;oon revive. When was &s;he thus before, daughter?"</P>
<P>"Not for many weeks, madam," replied the nun, "but her &s;pirits have been much agitated by the arrival of the gentleman &s;he wi&s;hed &s;o much to &s;ee."</P>
<P>"Yes," ob&s;erved the abbe&s;s," that has undoubtedly occa&s;ion|ed this paroxy&s;m of phrenzy. When &s;he is better, we will leave her to repo&s;e."</P>
<P>Emily very readily con&s;ented, but, though &s;he could now give little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he was unwilling to quit the chamber, while any might be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When Agnes recovered her &s;en&s;es, &s;he again fixed her eyes on Emily, but their wild expre&s;&s;ion was gone, and a gloomy mel|ancholy had &s;ucceeded. It was &s;ome moments before &s;he re|covered &s;ufficient &s;pirits to &s;peak; &s;he then &s;aid feebly&mdash;"The likene&s;s is wonderful!&mdash;&s;urely it mu&s;t be &s;omething more than fancy. Tell me, I conjure you," &s;he added, addre&s;&s;ing Emily, "though your name is St. Aubert, are you not the daughter of the Marchione&s;s?"</P>
<P>"What Marchione&s;s?" &s;aid Emily, in extreme &s;urpri&s;e; for, &s;he had imagined, from the calmne&s;s of Agnes' manner, that her intellects were re&s;tored. The abbe&s;s gave her a &s;ignificant glance, but &s;he repeated the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="029378_0330_0FE08889CD49A068">
"What Marchione&s;s?" exclaimed Agnes, "I know but of one, the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi."</P>
<P>Emily, remembering the emotion of her late father, upon the un|expected mention of this lady, and his reque&s;t to be laid near the tomb of the Villerois, now felt greatly intere&s;ted, and &s;he entreat|ed Agnes to explain the rea&s;on of her que&s;tion. The abbe&s;s would now have withdrawn Emily from the room, who being however, detained by a &s;trong intere&s;t, repeated her intreaties.</P>
<P>"Bring me that ca&s;ket, &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Agnes; "I will &s;hew her to you; yet you need only look in that mirror, and you will be|hold her; you &s;urely are her daughter; &s;uch &s;triking re&s;em|blance is never found but among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> relations."</P>
<P>The nun brought the ca&s;ket, and Agnes, having directed her how to unlock it, &s;he took thence a miniature, in which Emily perceived the exact re&s;emblance of the picture, which &s;he had found among her late father's papers. Agnes held out her hand to receive it; gazed upon it earne&s;tly for &s;ome moments in &s;ilence; and then, with a countenance of deep de&s;pair, threw up her eyes to heaven, and prayed inwardly. When &s;he had fini&s;h|ed, &s;he returned the miniature to Emily. "Keep it, "&s;aid &s;he "I bequeath it to you, for I mu&s;t believe it is your right. I have frequently ob&s;erved the re&s;emblance between you; but never, till this day, did it &s;trike upon my con&s;cience &s;o power|fully! Stay, &s;i&s;ter, do not remove the ca&s;ket&mdash;there is another picture I would &s;hew."</P>
<P>Emily trembled with expectation, and the abbe&s;s again would have withdrawn her. "Agnes is &s;till di&s;ordered," &s;aid &s;he, "you ob&s;erve how &s;he wanders. In the&s;e moods &s;he &s;ays any thing, and does not &s;cruple, as you have witne&s;&s;ed, to accu&s;e her&s;elf of the mo&s;t horrible crimes."</P>
<P>Emily, however, thought &s;he perceived &s;omething more than madne&s;s in the incon&s;i&s;tencies of Agnes, who&s;e mention of the Mar|chione&s;s, and production of her picture, had intere&s;ted her &s;o much, that &s;he determined to obtain further information, if po&s;&s;ible, re|&s;pecting the &s;ubject of it.</P>
<P>The nun returned with the ca&s;ket, and, Agnes pointing out to her a &s;ecret drawer, &s;he took from it another miniature. "Here," &s;aid Agnes, as &s;he offered it to Emily, "learn a le&s;&s;on for your vanity, at lea&s;t; look well at this picture, and &s;ee if you can di&s;|cover any re&s;emblance between what I was, and what I am."</P>
<P>Emily impatiently received the miniature, which her eyes had &s;carcely glanced upon, before her trembling hands had nearly &s;uf|fered it to fall&mdash;it was the re&s;emblance of the portrait of Signora Laurentini, which &s;he had formerly &s;een in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho,
<PB N="207" REF="029378_0330_0FE08889CD49A068">
the lady, who had di&s;appeared in &s;o my&s;terious a manner, and whom Montoni had been &s;u&s;pected of having cau&s;ed to be murdered.</P>
<P>In &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, Emily continued to gaze alternately upon the picture and the dying nun, endeavouring to trace a re&s;emblance between them, which no longer exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>"Why do you look &s;o &s;ternly on me?" &s;aid Agnes, mi&s;taking the nature of Emily's emotion.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een this face before," &s;aid Emily, at length; "was it really your re&s;emblance?"</P>
<P>"You may well a&s;k that que&s;tion," replied the nun,&mdash;but it was once e&s;teemed a &s;triking likene&s;s of me. Look at me well, and &s;ee what guilt has made me. I then was innocent; the evil pa&s;&s;ions of my nature &s;lept. Si&s;ter!" added &s;he, &s;olemnly, and &s;tretching forth her cold, damp hand to Emily, who &s;huddered at its touch&mdash;"Si&s;ter! beware of the fir&s;t indulgence of the pa&s;&s;ions; beware of the fir&s;t! Their cour&s;e, if not checked then, is rapid&mdash;their force is uncontroulable&mdash;they lead us we know not whither, they lead us perhaps to the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, for which whole years of prayer and penitence cannot atone!&mdash;Such may be the force of even a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ion, that it overcomes every other, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears up every other approach to the heart. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing us like a fiend, it leads us on to the acts of a fiend, making us in&s;en&s;ible to pity and to con&s;cience. And, when its purpo&s;e is accompli&s;hed, like a fiend, it leaves us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the torture of tho&s;e feelings, which its power had &s;u&s;pended&mdash;not annihilated,&mdash;to the tortures of com|pa&s;&s;ion, remor&s;e, and con&s;cience. Then, we awaken as from a dream, and perceive a new world around us&mdash;we gaze in a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and horror&mdash;but the deed is committed; not all the powers of heaven and earth united can undo it&mdash;and the &s;pectres of con|&s;cience will not fly! What are riches&mdash;grandeur&mdash;health it&s;elf, to the luxury of a pure con&s;cience, the health of the &s;oul; and what the &s;ufferings of poverty, di&s;appointment, de&s;pair&mdash;to the an|gui&s;h of an afflicted one! O! how long is it &s;ince I knew that luxury! I believed, that I had &s;uffered the mo&s;t agonizing pangs of human nature, in love, jealou&s;y and de&s;pair; but the&s;e pangs were ea&s;e, compared with the &s;tings of con&s;cience, which I have &s;ince endured. I ta&s;ted too, what was called the &s;weet of revenge, but it was tran&s;ient, it expired even with the object, that provok|ed it. Remember, &s;i&s;ter, that the pa&s;&s;ions are the &s;eeds of vices as well as of virtues, from which either may &s;pring, accordingly as they are nurtured. Unhappy they who have never been taught the art to govern them!"</P>
<P>"Alas! unhappy!" &s;aid the abbe&s;s," and ill informed of our holy religion!" Emily li&s;tened to Agnes, in &s;ilent awe, while
<PB N="208" REF="029378_0331_0FE0888EA8DF70A0">
&s;he &s;till examined the miniature, and became confirmed in her opinion of its &s;trong re&s;emblance to the portrait at Udolpho.&mdash;"This face is familiar to me," &s;aid &s;he, wi&s;hing to lead the nun to an explanation, yet fearing to di&s;cover too abruptly her know|ledge of Udolpho.</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken," replied Agnes, "you certainly never &s;aw that picture before."</P>
<P>"No," replied Emily, "but I have &s;een one extremely like it." "Impo&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Agnes, who may now be called the Lady Laurentini.</P>
<P>"It was in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho," continued Emily, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at her.</P>
<P>"Of Udolpho!" exclaimed Laurentini, "of Udolpho in Italy!" "The &s;ame" replied Emily.</P>
<P>"You know me then," &s;aid Laurentini, "and you are the daughter of the Marchione&s;s." Emily was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed at this abrupt a&s;&s;ertion. I am the daughter of the late Mon&s;. St. Au|bert," &s;aid &s;he; "and the lady you name is an utter &s;tranger to me."</P>
<P>"At lea&s;t you believe &s;o," rejoined Laurentini.</P>
<P>Emily a&s;ked what rea&s;ons there could be to believe otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>"The family likene&s;s, that you bear her," &s;aid the nun. "The Marchione&s;s, it is known, was attached to a gentleman of Ga&s;|cony, at the time when &s;he accepted the hand of the Marquis, by the command of her father. Ill fated, unhappy woman!"</P>
<P>Emily remembering the extreme emotion which St. Aubert had betrayed on the mention of the Marchione&s;s, would now have &s;uffered &s;omething more than &s;urpri&s;e had her confidence in his integrity been le&s;s; as it was, &s;he could not, for a moment, believe what the words of Laurentini in&s;inuated; yet &s;he &s;till felt &s;trongly intere&s;ted, concerning them, and begged, that &s;he would explain them further.</P>
<P>"Do not urge me on that &s;ubject," &s;aid the nun, "it is to me a terrible one! Would that I could blot it from my memory!" She &s;ighed deeply, and, after the pau&s;e of a moment, a&s;ked Emily, by what means &s;he had di&s;covered her name?</P>
<P>"By your portrait in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, to which this miniature bears a &s;triking re&s;emblance," replied Emily.</P>
<P>"You have been at Udolpho then!" &s;aid the nun, with great emotion. "Alas! what &s;cenes does the mention of it revive in my fancy&mdash;&s;cenes of happine&s;s, of &s;ufferings, and of horror!"</P>
<P>At this moment, the terrible &s;pectacle, which Emily had wit|ne&s;&s;ed in a chamber of that ca&s;tle, occurred to her, and &s;he &s;hud|dered, while &s;he looked upon the nun&mdash;and recollected her
<PB N="209" REF="029378_0331_0FE0888EA8DF70A0">
late words&mdash;that "years of prayer and penitence could not wa&s;h out the foulne&s;s of murder." She was now compelled to attribute the&s;e to another cau&s;e, than that of delirium. With a degree of horror, that almo&s;t deprived her of &s;en&s;e, &s;he now be|lieved &s;he looked upon a murderer; all the recollected behaviour of Laurentini &s;eemed to confirm the &s;uppo&s;ition&punc; yet Emily was &s;till lo&s;t in a labyrinth of perplexities, and, not knowing how to a&s;k the que&s;tions, which might lead to truth, &s;he could only hint them in broken &s;entences.</P>
<P>"Your &s;udden departure from Udolpho"&mdash;&s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Laurentini groaned.</P>
<P>"The reports that followed it," continued Emily&mdash;"The we&s;t chamber&mdash;the mourning veil&mdash;the object it conceals&mdash;when mur|ders are committed&mdash;"</P>
<P>The nun &s;hrieked, "What! there again!" &s;aid &s;he, endeavour|ing to rai&s;e her&s;elf, while her &s;tarting eyes &s;eemed to follow &s;ome object round the room&mdash;" Come from the grave! What! Blood&mdash;blood too!&mdash;There was no blood&mdash;thou can'&s;t not &s;ay it!&mdash;Nay, do not &s;mile,&mdash;do not &s;mile &s;o piteou&s;ly!"</P>
<P>Laurentini fell into convul&s;ions, as &s;he uttered the la&s;t words; and Emily, unable any longer to endure the horror of the &s;cene, hurried from the room, and &s;ent &s;ome nuns to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, and the boarders, who were in the parlour, now a&s;&s;embled round Emily, and, alarmed by her manner and af|frighted countenance, a&s;ked a hundred que&s;tions, which &s;he avoid|ed an&s;wering further, than by &s;aying, that &s;he believed &s;i&s;ter Ag|nes was dying. They received this as a &s;ufficient explanation of her terror, and had then lei&s;ure to offer re&s;toratives, which, at length, &s;omewhat revived Emily, who&s;e mind was, however, &s;o much &s;hocked with terrible &s;urmi&s;es, and perplexed with doubts by &s;ome words from the nun, that &s;he was unable to conver&s;e, and would have left the convent immediately, had &s;he not wi&s;hed to know whether Laurentini would &s;urvive the late attack. After waiting &s;ometime, &s;he was informed, that, the convul&s;ions having cea&s;ed, Laurentini &s;eemed to be reviving, and Emily and Blanche were departing, when the abbe&s;s appeared, who, drawing the former a&s;ide, &s;aid &s;he had &s;omething of con&s;equence to &s;ay to her, but, as it was late, &s;he would not detain her then, and reque&s;ted to &s;ee her on the following day.</P>
<P>Emily promi&s;ed to vi&s;it her, and, having taken leave, returned with the Lady Blanche towards the chateau, on the way to which the deep gloom of the woods made Blanche lament, that the even|ing
<PB N="210" REF="029378_0332_0FE0889D731ED678">
was &s;o far advanced; for the &s;urrounding &s;tillne&s;s and ob|&s;curity rendered her &s;en&s;ible of fear, though there was a &s;ervant to protect her; while Emily was too much engaged by the hor|rors of the &s;cene &s;he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed, to be affected by the &s;o|lemnity of the &s;hades, otherwi&s;e, than as they &s;erved to promote her gloomy reverie, from which, however, &s;he was at length re|called by the Lady Blanche, who pointed out, at &s;ome di&s;tance, in the du&s;ky path they were winding two per&s;ons &s;lowly advanc|ing. It was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid them without &s;triking into a &s;till more &s;ecluded part of the wood, whither the &s;trangers might ea&s;ily follow; but all apprehen&s;ion vani&s;hed, when Emily di&s;tingui&s;hed the voice of Mon&s;. Du Pont, and perceived, that his companion was the gentleman, whom &s;he had &s;een at the mona&s;tery, and who was now conver&s;ing with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s as not immediately to perceive their approach. When Du Pont joined the ladies, the &s;tranger took leave, and they proceeded to the chateau, where the Count, when he heard of Mon&s;. Bonnac, claimed him for an acquaintance, and, on learning the melancholy occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it to Languedoc, and that he was lodged at a &s;mall inn in the vil|lage, begged the favour of Mon&s;. Du Pont to invite him to the chateau.</P>
<P>The latter was happy to do &s;o, and the &s;cruples of re&s;erve, which made M. Bonnac he&s;itate to accept the invitation, being at length overcome, they went to the chateau, where the kindne&s;s of the Count and the &s;prightline&s;s of his &s;on were exerted to di&s;|&s;ipate the gloom that overhung the &s;pirits of the &s;tranger. M. Bonnac was an officer in the French &s;ervice, and appeared to be about fifty; his figure was tall and commanding, his manners had received the la&s;t poli&s;h, and there was &s;omething in his coun|tenance uncommonly intere&s;ting; for over features, which in youth, mu&s;t have been remarkably hand&s;ome, was &s;pread a mel|ancholy, that &s;eemed the effect of long misfortune, rather than of con&s;titution or temper.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation he held, during &s;upper, was evidently an ef|fort of politene&s;s, and there were intervals in which, unable to &s;truggle again&s;t the feelings, that depre&s;&s;ed him, he relap&s;ed into &s;ilence and ab&s;traction, from which, however, the Count, &s;ome|times withdrew him in a manner &s;o delicate and benevolent, that Emily, while &s;he ob&s;erved him, almo&s;t fancied &s;he beheld her late father.</P>
<P>The party &s;eparated at an early hour, and then, in the &s;olitude of her apartment, the &s;cenes, which Emily had lately witne&s;&s;ed, returned to her fancy, with dreadful energy. That in the dy|ing

nun &s;he &s;hould have di&s;covered Signora Laurentini, who, in|&s;tead of having been murdered by Montoni, was, as it now &s;eem|ed, her&s;elf guilty of &s;ome dreadful crime, excited both horror and &s;urpri&s;e in a high degree: nor did the hints, which &s;he had dropped, re&s;pecting the marriage of the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi, and the inquiries &s;he had made concerning Emily's birth, occa&s;ion her a le&s;s degree of intere&s;t, though it was of a different nature.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory, which &s;i&s;ter Frances had formerly related, and had &s;aid to be that of Agnes, it now appeared, was erroneous; but for what purpo&s;e it had been fabricated, unle&s;s the more effec|tually to conceal the true &s;tory, Emily could not even gue&s;s. Above all, her intere&s;t was excited as to the relation, which the &s;tory of the late Marchione&s;s de Villeroi bore to that of her father; for, that &s;ome kind of relation exi&s;ted between them, the grief of St. Aubert, upon hearing her named, his reque&s;t to be buried near her, and her picture, which had been found among his papers, certainly proved. Sometimes it occurred to Emily, that he might have been the lover to whom it was &s;aid the Marchione&s;s was attached, when &s;he was compelled to marry the Marquis de Villeroi; but that he had afterwards cheri&s;hed a pa&s;&s;ion for her, &s;he could not &s;uffer her&s;elf to believe, for a moment. The papers, which he had &s;o &s;olemnly enjoined her to de&s;troy, &s;he now fancied had related to this connection, and &s;he wi&s;hed more earne&s;tly than before to know the rea&s;ons, that made him con&s;ider the injunction nece&s;&s;ary, which, had her faith in his principles been le&s;s, would have led to believe, that there was a my&s;tery in her birth di&s;honourable to her parents, which tho&s;e manu&s;cripts might have revealed.</P>
<P>Reflections, &s;imilar to the&s;e, engaged her mind, during the greater part of the night, and when, at length, &s;he fell into a &s;lumber, it was only to behold a vi&s;ion of the dying nun, and to awaken in horrors, like tho&s;e &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;he was too much indi&s;po&s;ed to attend her appointment with the abbe&s;s, and, before the day con|cluded, &s;he heard, that &s;i&s;ter Agnes was no more. Mon&s;. Bonnac received this intelligence, with concern; but Emily ob&s;erved, that he did not appear &s;o much affected now, as on the preceding evening, immediately after quitting the apartment, of the nun, who&s;e death was probably le&s;s terrible to him, than the confe&s;&s;ion he had been then called upon to witne&s;s. However this might be, he was perhaps con&s;oled, in &s;ome degree, by a knowledge of the legacy bequeathed him, &s;ince his family was large, and the ex|travagance of &s;ome part of it had lately been the means of involv|ing him in great di&s;tre&s;s, and even in the horrors, of a pri&s;on; <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages">
<PB N="214" REF="029378_0333_0FE088A21095C5F8">
dered her beauty more enchanting, if po&s;&s;ible, to his fancy, than it had ever yet appeared. Experience had taught him to under|&s;tand the full value of the qualities, which he had before admired, but which the contra&s;ted characters he had &s;een in the world made him now adore; and the&s;e reflections, increa&s;ing the pangs of remor&s;e and regret, occa&s;ioned the deep dejection, that had accompanied him even into the pre&s;ence of Emily, of whom he con&s;idered him&s;elf no longer worthy. To the ignominy of hav|ing received pecuniary obligations from the Marchione&s;s Cham|fort, or any other lady of intrigue, as the Count De Villefort had been informed, or of having been engaged in the depredat|ing &s;chemes of game&s;ters, Valancourt had never &s;ubmitted; and the&s;e were &s;ome of &s;uch &s;candals as often mingle with truth, again&s;t the unfortunate. Count De Villefort had received them from authority, which he had no rea&s;on to doubt, and which the imprudent conduct he had him&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed in Valancourt, had certainly induced him the more readily to believe. Being &s;uch as Emily could not name to the Chevalier, he had no opportu|nity of refuting them; and, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be un|worthy of her e&s;teem, he little &s;u&s;pected, that he was confirm|ing to her the mo&s;t dreadful calumnies. Thus the mi&s;take had been mutual, and had remained &s;o, when Mon&s;. Bonnac explain|ed the conduct of his generous, but imprudent young friend to Du Pont, who, with &s;evere ju&s;tice, determined not only to un|deceive the Count on this &s;ubject, but to re&s;ign all hope of Emi|ly. Such a &s;acrifice as his love rendered this, was de&s;erving of a noble reward, and Mon&s;. Bonnac, if it had been po&s;&s;ible for him to forget the benevolent Valancourt, would have wi&s;hed that Emily might accept the ju&s;t Du Pont.</P>
<P>When the Count was informed of the error he had committed, he was extremely &s;hocked at the con&s;equence of his credulity, and the account which Mon&s;. Bonnac gave of his friend's &s;itua|tion, while at Paris, convinced him, that Valancourt had been entrapped by the &s;chemes of a &s;et of di&s;&s;ipated young men, with whom his profe&s;&s;ion had partly obliged him to a&s;&s;ociate, rather than by an inclination to vice; and, charmed by the humanity, and noble, though ra&s;h genero&s;ity, which his conduct towards Mon&s;. Bonnac exhibited, he forgave him the tran&s;ient errors, that had &s;tained his youth, and re&s;tored him to the high degree of e&s;teem, with which he had regarded him, during their early ac|quaintance. But, as the lea&s;t reparation he could now make Valancourt was to afford him an opportunity of explaining to Emily his former conduct, he immediately wrote, to reque&s;t his

forgivene&s;s of the unintentional injury he had done him, and to invite him to Chateau-le-Blanc. Motives of delicacy withheld the Count from informing Emily of this letter, and of kindne&s;s from acquainting her with the di&s;covery re&s;pecting Valancourt, till his arrival &s;hould &s;ave her from the po&s;&s;ibility of anxiety, as to its event; and this precaution &s;pared her even &s;everer inqui|etude, than the Count had fore&s;een, &s;ince he was ignorant of the &s;ymptoms of de&s;pair, which Valancourt's late conduct had be|trayed.</P>

<P>SOME circum&s;tances of an extraordinary nature now with|drew Emily from her own &s;orrows, and excited emotions, which partook of both &s;urpri&s;e and horror.</P>
<P>A few days following that, on which Signora Laurentini died, her will was opened at the mona&s;tery, in the pre&s;ence of the &s;u|periors and Mon&s;. Bonnac, when it was found, that one third of her per&s;onal property was bequeathed to the neare&s;t &s;urviving re|lative of the late Marchione&s;s de Villeroi, and that Emily was the per&s;on.</P>
<P>With the &s;ecret of Emily's family the abbe&s;s had long been acquainted, and it was in ob&s;ervance of the earne&s;t reque&s;t of St. Aubert, who was known to the friar, that attended him on his death bed, that his daughter had remained in ignorance of her relation&s;hip to the Marchione&s;s. But &s;ome hints, which had fallen from Signora Laurentini, during her la&s;t interview with Emily, and a confe&s;&s;ion of a very extraordinary nature, given in her dying hours, had made the abbe&s;s think it nece&s;&s;ary to con|ver&s;e with her young friend, on the topic &s;he had not before ventured to introduce; and it was for this purpo&s;e, that &s;he had reque&s;ted to &s;ee her on the morning that followed her interview with the nun. Emily's indi&s;po&s;ition had then prevented the in|tended conver&s;ation; but now, after the will had been examined,

&s;he received a &s;ummons, which &s;he immediately obeyed, and be|came informed of circum&s;tances, that powerfully affected her. As the narrative of the abbe&s;s was, however, deficient in many particulars, of which the reader may wi&s;h to be informed, and the hi&s;tory of the nun is materially connected with the fate of the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi, we &s;hall omit the conver&s;ation, that pa&s;&s;ed in the parlour of the convent, and mingle with out rela|tion a brief hi&s;tory of
LAURENTINI DI UDOLPHO,</P>
<P>Who was the only child of her parents, and heire&s;s of the an|cient hou&s;e of Udolpho, in the territory of Venice. It was the fir&s;t misfortune of her life, and that which led to all her &s;uc|ceeding mi&s;ery, that the friends who ought to have re&s;trained her &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and mildly in&s;tructed her in the art of gov|erning them, nurtured them by early indulgence. But they cheri&s;hed their own failings in her; for their conduct was not the re&s;ult of rational kindne&s;s, and, when they either indulg|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> oppo&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ions of their child, they gratified their own. Thus they indulged her with weakne&s;s, and reprehended her with violence, her &s;pirit was exa&s;perated by their vehe|mence, in&s;tead of being corrected by their wi&s;dom; and their oppo&s;itions became conte&s;ts for victory, in which the due tender|ne&s;s of the parents, and the affectionate duties of the child, were equally forgotten; but, as returning fondne&s;s di&s;armed the pa|rent's re&s;entment &s;oone&s;t, Laurentini was &s;uffered to believe that &s;he had conquered, and her pa&s;&s;ions became &s;tronger by every effort, that had been employed to &s;ubdue them.</P>
<P>The death of her father and mother in the &s;ame year left her to her own di&s;cretion, under the dangerous circum&s;tances attend|ant on youth and beauty. She was fond of company, delight|ed with admiration, yet di&s;dainful of the opinion of the world, when it happened to contradict her inclinations; had a gay and brilliant wit, and was mi&s;tre&s;s of all the arts of fa&s;cination. Her conduct was &s;uch as might have been expected, from the weak|ne&s;s of her principles and the &s;trength of her pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Among her numerous admirers was the late Marquis de Vil|leroi, who, on his tour through Italy, &s;aw Laurentini at Venice, where &s;he u&s;ually re&s;ided, and became her pa&s;&s;ionate adorer. Equally captivated by the figure and accompli&s;hments of the Marquis, who was at that period one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed noblemen of the French court, &s;he had art &s;o effectually to
<PB N="217" REF="029378_0335_0FE088B800FBD4C0">
conceal from him the dangerous traits of her character and the blemi&s;hes of her late conduct, that he &s;olicited her hand in marriage.</P>
<P>Before the nuptials were concluded, &s;he retired to the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, whither the Marquis followed, and, where her conduct relaxing from the propriety, which &s;he had lately a&s;&s;umed, di&s;|covered to him the precipice, on which he &s;tood. A minuter, in|quiry than he had before thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make, con|vinced him, that he had been deceived in her character, and &s;he, whom he had de&s;igned for his wife, afterwards became his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks at Udolpho, he was called abruptly to France, whither he returned with extreme reluctance, for his heart was &s;till fa&s;cinated by the arts of Laurentini, with whom, however, he had, on various pretences, delayed his marriage; but, to reconcile her to this &s;eparation, he now gave repeated promi&s;es of returning to conclude the nuptials, as &s;oon as the affair, which thus &s;uddenly called him to France, &s;hould permit.</P>
<P>Soothed, in &s;ome degree, by the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, &s;he &s;uffered him to depart; and, &s;oon after, her relative, Montoni, arriving at Udolpho, renewed the addre&s;&s;es, which &s;he had before refu&s;ed, and which &s;he now again rejected. Meanwhile, her thoughts were con&s;tantly with the Marquis de Villeroi, for whom &s;he &s;uf|fered all the delirium of Italian love, cheri&s;hed by the &s;olitude, to which &s;he confined her&s;elf; for &s;he had now lo&s;t all ta&s;te for the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety and the gaiety of amu&s;ement. Her only indulgences were to &s;igh and weep over a miniature of the Mar|quis; to vi&s;it the &s;cenes, that had witne&s;&s;ed their happine&s;s, to pour forth her heart to him in writing, and to count the weeks, the days, which mu&s;t intervene before the period that he had mentioned as probable for his return. But this period p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed without bringing him; and week after week followed in heavy and almo&s;t intolerable expectation. During this interval, Lau|rentini's fancy, occupied ince&s;&s;antly by one idea, became di&s;or|dered; and, her whole heart being devoted to one object, life became hateful to her, when &s;he believed that object lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Several months pa&s;&s;ed, during which &s;he heard nothing from the Marquis de Villeroi, and her days were marked, at intervals, with the phren&s;y of pa&s;&s;ion and the &s;ullenne&s;s of de&s;pair. She &s;ecluded her&s;elf from all vi&s;itors, and, &s;ometimes, remained in her apartment, for weeks together, refu&s;ing to &s;peak to every per&s;on, except her favourite female attendant, writing &s;craps of letters, reading, again and again, tho&s;e &s;he had received from the Mar|quis, weeping over his picture, and &s;peaking to it, for many hours, upbraiding, reproaching and care&s;&s;ing it alternately.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="029378_0336_0FE088C38ABD0600">
At length, a report reached her, that the Marquis had married in France, and, after &s;uffering all the extremes of love, jealou&s;y and indignation, &s;he formed the de&s;perate re&s;olution of going &s;ecretly to that country, and, if the report proved true, of at|tempting a deep revenge. To her favourite woman only &s;he confided the plan of her journey, and &s;he engaged her to partake of it. Having collected her jewels, which, de&s;cending to her from many branches of her family, were of immen&s;e value, and all her ca&s;h, to a very large amount, they were packed in a trunk, which was privately conveyed to a neighbouring town, whither Laurentini, with this only &s;ervant, followed, and thence proceed|ed &s;ecretly to Leghorn, where they embarked for France.</P>
<P>When, on her arrival in Languedoc, &s;he found, that the Mar|quis de Villeroi had been married for &s;ome months, her de&s;pair almo&s;t deprived her of rea&s;on, and &s;he alternately projected and abandoned the horrible de&s;ign of murdering the Marquis, his wife and her&s;elf. At length &s;he contrived to throw her&s;elf in his way, with an intention of reproaching him, for his conduct, and of &s;labbing her&s;elf in his pre&s;ence; but, when &s;he again &s;aw him, who &s;o long had been the con&s;tant object of her thoughts and affections, re&s;entment yielded to love; her re&s;olution failed; &s;he trembled with the conflict of emotions, that a&s;&s;ailed her heart, and fainted away.</P>
<P>The Marquis was not proof again&s;t her beauty and &s;en&s;ibility; all the energy, with which he had fir&s;t loved, returned, for his pa&s;&s;ion had been re&s;i&s;ted by prudence, rather than overcome by indifference; and, &s;ince the honour of his family would not per|mit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to marry her, he had endeavoured to &s;ubdue his love, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o far &s;ucceeded, as to &s;elect the then Marchione&s;s for his wife, whom he loved at fir&s;t with a tempered and rational af|fection. But the mild virtues of that amiable lady did not re|compen&s;e him for her indifference, which appeared, notwith|&s;tanding her efforts to conceal it; and he had, for &s;ometime, &s;u&s;pected that her affections were engaged by another per&s;on, when Laurentini arrived in Languedoc. This artful Italian &s;oon perceived, that &s;he had regained her influence over him, and, &s;ooth|ed by the di&s;covery, &s;he determined to live, and to employ all her enchantments to win his con&s;ent to the diabolical deed, which &s;he believed was nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecurity of her happi|ne&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he conducted her &s;cheme with deep di&s;&s;imulation and patient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and, having completely e&s;tranged the af|fections of the Marquis from his wife, who&s;e gentle goodne&s;s and unimpa&s;&s;ioned manners had cea&s;ed to plea&s;e, when contra&s;ted
<PB N="219" REF="029378_0336_0FE088C38ABD0600">
with the captivations of the Italian, &s;he proceeded to awaken in his mind the jealou&s;y of pride, for it was no longer that of love, and even pointed out to him the per&s;on, to whom &s;he affirmed the Marchione&s;s had &s;acrificed her honour; but Laurentini had fir&s;t extorted from him a &s;olemn promi&s;e to forbear avenging him&s;elf upon his rival. This was an important part of her plan, for &s;he knew, that, if his de&s;ire of vengeance was re&s;trained to|wards one party, it would burn more fiercely towards the other, and he might then, perhaps, be prevailed on to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the hor|rible act, which would relea&s;e him from the only barrier, that withheld him from making her his wife.</P>
<P>The innocent Marchione&s;s, meanwhile, ob&s;erved, with ex|treme grief, the alteration in her hu&s;band's manners. He be|came re&s;erved and thoughtful in her pre&s;ence; his conduct was au&s;tere, and &s;ometimes even rude; and he left her, for many hours together, to weep for his unkindne&s;s, and to form plans for the recovery of his affection. His conduct afflicted her the more, becau&s;e, in obedience to the command of her father, &s;he had ac|cepted his hand, though her affections were engaged to another, who&s;e amiable di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he had rea&s;on to believe, would have en&s;ured her happine&s;s. This circum&s;tance Laurentini had di&s;|covered, &s;oon after her arrival in France, and had made ample u&s;e of it in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her de&s;igns upon the Marquis, to whom &s;he adduced &s;uch &s;eeming proof of his wife's infidelity, that, in the frantic rage of wounded honour, he con&s;ented to de&s;troy his wife. A &s;low poi&s;on was admini&s;tered, and &s;he fell a victim to the jealou&s;y and &s;ubtlety of Laurentini and to the guilty weak|ne&s;s of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>But the moment of Laurentini's triumph, the moment, to which &s;he had looked forward for the completion of all her wi&s;hes, proved only the commencement of a &s;uffering, that never left her to her dying hour.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of revenge, which had in part &s;timulated her to the commi&s;&s;ion of this atrocious deed, died, even at the moment when it was gratified, and left her to the horrors of unavailing pity and remor&s;e, which would probably have empoi&s;oned all the years &s;he had promi&s;ed her&s;elf with the Marquis de Villeroi, had her expectations of an alliance with him been realized. But he, too, had found the moment of his revenge to be that of re|mor&s;e, as to him&s;elf, and dete&s;tation, as to the partner of his crime; the feeling, which he had mi&s;taken for conviction, was no more; and he &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed, and agha&s;t, that no proof re|mained of his wife's infidelity now that &s;he had &s;uffered the
<PB N="220" REF="029378_0337_0FE088C92D48F4E0">
puni&s;hment of guilt. Even when he was informed, that &s;he was dying, he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lt &s;uddenly and unaccountably rea&s;&s;ured of her innocence, nor was the &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance &s;he made him in her la&s;t-hour, capable of affording him a &s;tronger conviction of her blamele&s;s conduct.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t horrors of remor&s;e and de&s;pair, he felt inclined to deliver up him&s;elf and the woman, who had plunged him into this aby&s;s of guilt, into the hands of ju&s;tice; but, when the par|oxy&s;m of his &s;uffering was ever, his intention changed. Lau|rentini, however, he &s;aw only once afterwards, and that was, to cur&s;e her as the in&s;tigator of his crime, and to &s;ay, that he &s;pared her life only on condition, that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of her days in prayer and penance. Overwhelmed with di&s;appointment, on re|ceiving contempt and abhorrence from the man, for who&s;e &s;ake &s;he had not &s;crupled to &s;tain her con&s;cience with human blood, and touched with horror of the unavailing crime &s;he had com|mitted, &s;he renounced the world, and retired to the mona&s;tery of St. Claire, a dreadful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Marquis, immediately after th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his wife, quitted Chateau-le-Blanc, to which he never returned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> endeavoured to lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of his crime amid&s;t the tumult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> war, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the di&s;&s;ipations of a capital; but his efforts were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; a deep dejection hung over him ever after, for which his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t intimate friends could not account, and he, at length, died, with a degree of horror nearly equal to that, which Laurentini had &s;uffered. The phy&s;ician, who had ob&s;erved the &s;ingular appearance of the unfortunate Marchione&s;s, after death, had been bribed to &s;ilence; and, as the &s;urmi&s;es of a few of the &s;ervants had proceeded no further than a whi&s;per, the affair had never been inve&s;tigated. Whether this whi&s;per ever reached the father of the Marchione&s;s, and, if it did, whether the difficulty of obtaining proof deterred him from pro&s;ecuting the Marquis de Villeroi, is uncertain; but her death was deeply lamented by &s;ome part of her family, and particularly by her brother, M. St. Aubert; for that was the de|gree of relation&s;hip, which had exi&s;ted between Emily's father and the Marchione&s;s; and there is no doubt, that he &s;u&s;pected the man|ner of her death. Many letters pa&s;&s;ed between the Marquis and him, &s;oon after the decea&s;e of his beloved &s;i&s;ter, the &s;ubject of which was not known, but there is rea&s;on to believe, that they related to the cau&s;e of her death; and the&s;e were the papers, together with &s;ome letters of the Marchione&s;s, who had confided to her brother the occa&s;ion of her unhappine&s;s, which St. Aubert had &s;o &s;olemnly enjoined his daughter to de&s;troy: and anxiety
<PB N="221" REF="029378_0337_0FE088C92D48F4E0">
for her peace had probably made him forbid her to inquire into the melancholy &s;tory, to which they alluded. Such, indeed, had been his affliction, on the premature death of this his favourite &s;i&s;t|er, who&s;e unhappy marriage had from the fir&s;t excited his tendere&s;t pity, that he never could hear her named, or mention her him&s;elf after her death, except to Madame St. Aubert. From Emily, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility he feared to awaken, he had &s;o carefully con|cealed her hi&s;tory and name, that &s;he was ignorant, till now, that &s;he ever had &s;uch a relative as the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi; and from this motive he had enjoined &s;ilence to his only &s;urviving &s;i&s;ter, Madame Cheron, who had &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>It was over &s;ome of the la&s;t pathetic letters of the Marchione&s;s, that St. Aubert was weeping, when he was ob&s;erved by Emily, on the eve of her departure from La Vallee, and it was her pic|ture which he had &s;o tenderly care&s;&s;ed. Her di&s;a&s;trous death may account for the emotion he had betrayed, on hearing her named by La Voi&s;in, and for his reque&s;t to be interred near the monu|ment of the Villerois, where her remains were depo&s;ited, but not tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, who was buried, where he died, in the north of France.</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;or, who attended St. Aubert in his la&s;t moments, recollected him to be the brother of the late Marchione&s;s, when St. Aubert, from tenderne&s;s to Emily, had conjured him to conceal the circum&s;tance, and to reque&s;t that the abbe&s;s, to who&s;e care he particularly recommended her would do the &s;ame; a reque&s;t, which had been exactly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Laurentini, on her arrival in France, had carefully concealed her name and family, and, the better to di&s;gui&s;e her real hi&s;tory, had, on entering the convent, cau&s;ed the &s;tory to be circulated, which had impo&s;ed on &s;i&s;ter Frances, and it is probable, that the abbe&s;s, who did not pre&s;ide in the convent, at the time of her noviciation, was al&s;o entirely ignorant of the truth. The deep remor&s;e, that &s;eized on the mind of Laurentini, together with the &s;ufferings of di&s;appointed pa&s;&s;ion, for &s;he &s;till loved the Mar|quis, again un&s;ettled her intellects, and, after the fir&s;t paroxy&s;ms of de&s;pair were pa&s;&s;ed, a heavy and &s;ilent melancholy had &s;ettled upon her &s;pirits, which &s;uffered few interruptions from fits of phren&s;y, till the time of her death. During many years it had been her only amu&s;ement to walk in the woods near the mona&s;t|ery, in the &s;olitary hours of night, and to play on a favourite in|&s;trument, to which &s;he &s;ometimes joined the delightful melody of her voice, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and melancholy airs of her na|tive country, modulated by all the energetic feeling, that dwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="222" REF="029378_0338_0FE088DA34CE5F20">
in her heart. The phy&s;ician, who had attended her, recommend|ed it to the &s;uperior to indulge her in this whim, as the only means of &s;oothing her di&s;tempered fancy; and &s;he was &s;uffered to walk in the lonely hours of night, attended by the &s;ervant, who had accompanied her from Italy; but, as the indulgence tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the rules of the convent, it was kept as &s;ecret as po&s;&s;ible; and thus the my&s;terious mu&s;ic of Laurentini had combined with other circum&s;tances, to produce a report, that not only the chateau, but its neighbourhood, was haunted.</P>
<P>Soon after her entrance into this holy community, and before &s;he had &s;hewn any &s;ymptoms of in&s;anity there, &s;he made a will, in which, after bequeathing a con&s;iderable legacy to the con|vent, &s;he divided the remainder of her per&s;onal property, which her jewels made very valuable, between the wife of Mon&s;. Bon|nac, who was an Italian lady and her relation, and the neare&s;t &s;urviving relative of the late Marchione&s;s de Villeroi. As Emi|ly St. Aubert was not only the neare&s;t, but the &s;ole relative, this legacy de&s;cended to her, and thus explained to her the whole my&s;tery of her father's conduct.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblance between Emily and her unfortunate aunt had frequently been ob&s;erved by Laurentini, and had occa&s;ion|ed the &s;ingular behaviour, which had formerly alarmed her; but it was in the nun's dying hour, when her con&s;cience gave her perpetually the idea of the Marchione&s;s, that &s;he became more &s;en&s;ible, than ever, of this likene&s;s, and, in her phren&s;y, deemed it no re&s;emblance of the per&s;on &s;he had injured, but the original her&s;elf. The bold a&s;&s;ertion, that had followed, on the recove|ry of her &s;en&s;es, that Emily was the daughter of the Marchio|ne&s;s de Villeroi, aro&s;e from a &s;u&s;picion that &s;he was &s;o; for, knowing that her rival, when &s;he married the Marquis, was at|tached to another lover, &s;he had &s;carcely &s;crupled to believe, that her honour had been &s;acrificed, like her own, to an unre|&s;i&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of a crime, however, to which Emily had &s;u&s;pected, from her phren&s;ied confe&s;&s;ion of murder, that &s;he had been in&s;trumental in the ca&s;tle of Udolpho, Laurentini was innocent; and &s;he had her&s;elf been deceived, concerning the &s;pectacle, that formerly oc|ca&s;ioned her &s;o much terror, and had &s;ince compelled her, for a while, to attribute the horrors of the nun to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a murder committed in that ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>It may be remembered, that, in a chamber of Udolpho, hung a black veil, who&s;e &s;ingular &s;ituation had excited Emily's curio&s;i|ty, and which afterwards di&s;clo&s;ed an object, that had overwhelm|ed
<PB N="223" REF="029378_0338_0FE088DA34CE5F20">
her with horror; for, on lifting it, there appeared, in&s;tead of the picture &s;he had expected, within a rece&s;s of the wall, a hu|man figure of gha&s;tly palene&s;s &s;tretched at its length, and dre&s;&s;ed in the habiliments of the grave. What added to the horror of the &s;pectacle, was, that the face appeared partly decayed and disfigured by worms, which were vi&s;ible on the features and hands. On &s;uch an object, it will be readily believed, that no per&s;on could endure to look twice. Emily, it may be recol|lected, had, after the fir&s;t glance, let the veil drop, and her ter|ror had prevented her from ever after provoking a renewal of &s;uch &s;uffering, as &s;he had then experienced. Had &s;he dared to look again, her delu&s;ion and her fears would have vani&s;hed to|gether, and &s;he would have perceived, that the figure before her was not human, but formed of wax. The hi&s;tory of it is &s;ome what extraordinary, though not without example in the records of that fierce &s;everity, which monki&s;h &s;uper&s;tition has &s;ome|times inflicted on mankind. A member of the hou&s;e of Udol|pho, having committed &s;ome offence again&s;t the prerogative of the church, had been condemned to the penance of contemplating, during certain hours of the day, a waxen image, made to re&s;em|ble a human body in the &s;tate, to which it is reduced after death. This penance, &s;erving as a memento of the condition at which he mu&s;t him&s;elf arrive, had been de&s;igned to reprove the pride of the Marquis of Udolpho, which had formerly &s;o much ex|a&s;perated that of the Romi&s;h church; and he had not only &s;u|per&s;titiou&s;ly ob&s;erved this penance him&s;elf, which he had believ|ed, was to obtain a pardon for all his &s;ins, but had made it a condition in his will, that his de&s;cendants &s;hould pre&s;erve the image, on pain of forfeiting to the church a certain part of his domain, that they al&s;o might profit by the humiliating moral it conveyed. The figure therefore, had been &s;uffered to retain its &s;tation in the wall of the chamber, but his de&s;cendants excu&s;|ed them&s;elves from ob&s;erving the penance, to which he had been enjoined.</P>
<P>This image was &s;o horribly natural, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing Emily &s;hould have mi&s;taken it for the object it re&s;embled, nor, &s;ince &s;he had heard &s;uch an extraordinary account, concerning the di&s;appearing of the late lady of the ca&s;tle, and had &s;uch ex|perience of the character of Montoni, that &s;he &s;hould have be|lieved this to be the murdered body of the lady Laurentini, and that he had been the contriver of her death.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation, in which &s;he had di&s;covered it, occa&s;ioned her, at fir&s;t, much &s;urpri&s;e and perplexity; but the vigilance, with
<PB N="224" REF="029378_0339_0FE088DECC12E588">
which the doors of the chamber, where it was depo&s;ited, were afterwards &s;ecured, had compelled her to believe, that Montoni, not daring to confide the &s;ecret of her death to any per&s;on, had &s;uffered her remains to decay in this ob&s;cure chamber. The cer|emony of the veil, however, and the circum&s;tance of the doors having been left open, even for a moment, had occa&s;ioned her much wonder and &s;ome doubts; but the&s;e were not &s;ufficient to overcome her &s;u&s;picion of Montoni; and it was the dread of his terrible, vengeance, that had &s;ealed her lips in &s;ilence, con|cerning what &s;he had &s;een in the we&s;t chamber.</P>
<P>Emily, in di&s;covering the Marchione&s;s de Villeroi to have been the &s;i&s;ter of Mon&s;. St. Aubert, was variou&s;ly affected; but, amid&s;t the &s;orrow, which &s;he &s;uffered for her untimely death, &s;he was relea&s;ed from an anxious and painful conjecture, occa|&s;ioned by the ra&s;h a&s;&s;ertion of Signora Laurentini, concerning her birth and the honour of her parents. Her faith in St. Aubert's principles would &s;carcely allow her to &s;u&s;pect that he had acted di&s;honourably, and &s;he felt &s;uch reluctance to believe her&s;elf the daughter of any other, than her, whom &s;he had always con&s;ider|ed and loved as a mother, that &s;he would hardly admit &s;uch a circum&s;tance to be po&s;&s;ible; yet the likene&s;s, which it had fre|quently been affirmed &s;he bore to the late Marchione&s;s, the former behaviour of Dorothee the old hou&s;ekeeper, the a&s;&s;ertion of Laurentini, and the my&s;terious attachment, which St. Aubert had di&s;covered, awakened doubts, as to his connection with the Marchione&s;s, which her rea&s;on could neither vanqui&s;h, or confirm. From the&s;e, however, &s;he was now relieved, and all the circum|&s;tances of her father's conduct were fully explained; but her heart was oppre&s;&s;ed by the melancholy cata&s;trophe of her amia|ble relative, and by the awful le&s;&s;on, which the hi&s;tory of the nun exhibited, the in ulgence of who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions had been the means of leading her gradually to the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime, from the prophecy of which in her early years &s;he would have recoiled in horror, and exclaimed&mdash;that it could not be!&mdash;a crime, which whole years of repentance and of the &s;evere&s;t pen|ance had not been able to obliterate from her con&s;cience.</P>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFTER the late di&s;coveries, Emily was di&s;tingui&s;hed at the chateau by the Count and his family, as a relative of the hou&s;e of Villeroi, and received, if po&s;&s;ible, more friendly attention, than had yet been &s;hewn her.</P>
<P>Count De Villefort's &s;urpri&s;e at the delay of an an&s;wer to his letter which had been directed to Valancourt, at E&s;tuviere, was mingled with &s;ati&s;faction for the prudence, which had &s;aved Emi|ly from a &s;hare of the anxiety he now &s;uffered, though, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aw her &s;till drooping under the effect of his former error, all his re&s;olution was nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train him from relating the truth, that would afford her a momentary relief. The ap|proaching nuptials of the Lady Blanche now divided his atten|tion with this &s;ubject of his anxiety, for the inhabitants of the chateau were already bu&s;ied in preparations for that event, and the arrival of Mon&s;. St. Foix, was daily expected. In the gai|ety, which &s;urrounded her, Emily vainly tried to participate, her &s;pirits being depre&s;&s;ed by the late di&s;coveries, and by the anxiety concerning the fate of Valancourt, that had been occa&s;ioned by the de&s;cription of his manner, when he had delivered the ring. She &s;eemed to perceive in it the gloomy wildne&s;s of de&s;pair; and, when &s;he con&s;idered to what that de&s;pair might have urged him, her heart &s;unk with terror and grief. The &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, as to his &s;afety, to which &s;he believed her&s;elf condemned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ill &s;he &s;hould return to La Vallee, appeared in&s;upportable, and, in &s;uch moments, &s;he could not even &s;truggle to a&s;&s;ume the com|po&s;ure, that had left her mind, but would often abruptly quit the company &s;he was with, and endeavour to &s;ooth her &s;pirits in the deep &s;olitude of the woods, that overbrowed the &s;hore. Here, the faint roar of foaming waves, that beat below, and the &s;ullen murmur of the wind among the branches around, were circum&s;tances in uni&s;on with the temper of her mind; and &s;he would &s;it on a cliff, or on the broken &s;teps of her favourite watch tower, ob&s;erving the changing colours of the evening clouds, and the gloom of twilight draw over the &s;ea, till the white <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ops of billows, riding towards the &s;hore, could &s;carcely be di&s;cerned amid&s;t the darkened waters. The lines, engraved by Valancourt on this tower, &s;he frequently repeated with melan|choly enthu&s;ia&s;m, and then would endeavour to check the recol|lections
<PB N="226" REF="029378_0340_0FE088ED123846B0">
and the grief they occa&s;ioned, and to turn her thoughts to indifferent &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>One evening, having wandered with her lute to this her fa|vourite &s;pot, &s;he entered the ruined tower, and a&s;cended a winding &s;tairca&s;e, that led to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;mall chamber, which was le&s;s decayed than the re&s;t of the building, and whence &s;he had often gazed, with admiration, on the wide pro&s;pect of &s;ea and land, that extended below. The &s;un was now &s;etting on that tract of the Pyrenees, which divides Languedoc from Rou&s;illon, and, placing her&s;elf oppo&s;ite to a &s;mall grated window, which, like the wood tops beneath, and the waves lower &s;till, gleamed with the red glow of the we&s;t, &s;he touched the chords of her lute in &s;olemn &s;ymphony, and then accompanied it with her voice, in one of the &s;imple and affecting airs, to which, in hap|pier days, Valancourt had often li&s;tened in rapture, and which &s;he now adapted to the following lines.</P>

</LG>
<P>The &s;oft tranquillity of the &s;cene below, where the evening breeze &s;carcely curled the water, or &s;welled the pa&s;&s;ing &s;ail, that caught the la&s;t gleam of the &s;un, and where, now and then, a dipping oar was all that di&s;turbed the trembling radiance, con|&s;pired with the tender melody of her lute to lull her mind into a &s;tate of gentle &s;adne&s;s, and &s;he &s;ung the mournful &s;ongs of pa&s;t times, till the remembrances they awakened were too powerful for her heart, her tears fell upon the lute, over which &s;he droop|ed, and her voice trembled, and was unable to proceed.</P>
<P>Though the &s;un had now &s;unk behind the mountains, and even his reflected light was fading from their highe&s;t points, Emily did not leave the watch tower, but continued to indulge her melancholy reverie, till a foot&s;tep, at a little di&s;tance, &s;tartled her, and, on looking through the grate, &s;he ob&s;erved a per&s;on walking below, whom however, &s;oon perceiving to be Mon&s;. Bonnac, &s;he returned to the quiet thoughtfulne&s;s his &s;tep had interrupted. After &s;ometime, &s;he again &s;truck her lute, and &s;ung her favourite air; but again a &s;tep di&s;turbed her, and, as &s;he pau&s;ed to li&s;ten, &s;he heard it a&s;cending the &s;tairca&s;e of the tower. The gloom of the hour, perhaps, made her &s;en&s;ible to &s;ome de|gree of fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> which &s;he might not otherwi&s;e have felt; for, only a few minutes before, &s;he had &s;een Mon&s;. Bonnac pa&s;s. The &s;teps were quick and bounding, and, in the next moment, the door of the chamber opened, and a per&s;on entered, who&s;e fea|tures were veiled in the ob&s;curity of twilight; but his voice could not be concealed, for it was the voice of Valancourt!</P>
<P>At the &s;ound, never heard by Emily without emotion, &s;he &s;tarted, in terror, a&s;toni&s;hment and doubtful plea&s;ure, and had &s;carcely beheld him at her feet, when &s;he &s;unk into a &s;eat, over|come by the various emotions, that contended at her heart, and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to that voice, who&s;e earne&s;t and trembling calls &s;eemed as if endeavouring to &s;ave her. Valancourt, as he hung over Emily, deplored his own ra&s;h impatience, in having thus
<PB N="228" REF="029378_0341_0FE088F20F48FE90">
&s;urpri&s;ed: her for when he had arrived at the chateau, too anx|ious to await the return of the Count, who, he under&s;tood, was in the grounds, he went him&s;elf to &s;eek him, when, as he pa&s;&s;ed the tower, he was &s;truck by the &s;ound of Emily's voice, and im|mediately a&s;cended.</P>
<P>It was a con&s;iderable time before &s;he revived, but, when her recollection returned, &s;he repul&s;ed his attentions, with an air of re&s;erve, and inquired, with as much di&s;plea&s;ure as it was po&s;&s;i|ble &s;he could feel in the&s;e fir&s;t moments of his appearance, the occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>"Ah Emily!" &s;aid Valancourt, "that air, tho&s;e words&mdash;alas! I have, then, little to hope&mdash;when you cea&s;ed to e&s;teem me, you cea&s;ed al&s;o to love me!"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t true, &s;ir," replied Emily, endeavouring to command her trembling voice; "and if you had valued my e&s;teem, you would not have given me this new occa&s;ion for unea&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>Valancourt's countenance changed &s;uddenly from the anxie|ties of doubt to an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;may: he was &s;ilent a moment, and then &s;aid, "I had been taught to hope for a very different reception! Is it, then, true, Emily, that I have lo&s;t your regard, for ever? am I to believe, that, though your e&s;teem for me may return&mdash;your affection never can? Can &s;he Count have meditated the cruelty, which now tortures me with a &s;e|cond death?"</P>
<P>The voice in which he &s;poke this, alarmed Emily as much as his words &s;urpri&s;ed her, and, with trembling impatience, &s;he begged that he would explain them.</P>
<P>"Can any explanation be nece&s;&s;ary?" &s;aid Valancourt, "do you not know how cruelly my conduct has been mi&s;repre&s;ented? that the actions of which you once believed me guilty (and, O Emily! how could you &s;o degrade me in your opinion, even for a moment!) tho&s;e actions&mdash;I hold in as much contempt and ab|horrence as your&s;elf? Are you, indeed, ignorant, that Count De Villefort has detected the &s;landers, that have robbed me of all I hold dear on earth, and has invited me hither to ju&s;tify to you my former conduct? It is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible you can be uninformed of the&s;e circum&s;tances, and I am again torturing my&s;elf with a fal&s;e hope!"</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of Emily confirmed this &s;uppo&s;ition; for the deep twilight would not allow Valancourt to di&s;tingui&s;h the a&s;toni&s;h|ment and doubting joy, that fixed her features. For a moment, &s;he continued unable to &s;peak; then a profound &s;igh &s;eemed to give &s;ome relief to her &s;pirits, and &s;he &s;aid,
<PB N="229" REF="029378_0341_0FE088F20F48FE90">
"Valancourt! I was, till this moment, ignorant of all the circum&s;tances you have mentioned; the emotion I now &s;uffer may a&s;&s;ure you the truth of this, and, that, though I had cea&s;ed to e&s;teem, I had not taught my&s;elf entirely to forger you."</P>
<P>"This moment," &s;aid Valancourt, in a low voice, and lean|ing for &s;upport again&s;t the window&mdash;"this moment brings with it a conviction that overpowers me! I am dear to you then&mdash;&s;till dear to you, my Emily!"</P>
<P>"Is it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould tell you &s;o?" &s;he replied, "is it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould &s;ay&mdash;the&s;e are the fir&s;t moments of joy I have known &s;ince your departure, and that they repay me for all tho&s;e of pain I have &s;uffered in the interval?"</P>
<P>Valancourt &s;ighed deeply, and was unable to reply; but, as he pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips, the tears, that fell over it &s;poke a language which could not be mi&s;taken, and to which words were inadequate.</P>
<P>Emily, &s;omewhat tranquillized, propo&s;ed returning to the cha|teau, and then, for the fir&s;t time, recollected that the Count had invited Valancourt thither to explain his conduct, and that no explanation had yet been given. But, while &s;he acknowledged this, her heart would not allow her to dwell, for a moment, on the po&s;&s;ibility of his unworthine&s;s; his look, his voice, his man|ner, all &s;poke the noble &s;incerity, which had formerly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him; and &s;he again permitted he&s;elf to indulge the emotions of a joy, more &s;urpri&s;ing and powerful, than &s;he had ever before experienced.</P>
<P>Neither Emily, or Valancourt, were con&s;cious how they reach|ed the chateau, whither they might have been transferred by the &s;pell of a fairy, for any thing they could remember; and it was not, till they had reached the great hall, that either of them recollected there were other per&s;ons in the world be&s;ides them|&s;elves. The Count then came forth with &s;urpri&s;e, and with the joyfulne&s;s of pure benevolence, to welcome Valancourt, and to entreat his forgivene&s;s of the inju&s;tice he had done him; &s;oon after which, Mon&s;. Bonnac joined this happy group, in which he and Valancourt were mutually rejoiced to meet.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t congratulations were over, and the general joy became &s;omewhat more tranquil, the Count withdrew with Val|ancourt to the library, where a long conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between them, in which the latter &s;o clearly ju&s;tified him&s;elf of the crim|inal parts of the conduct, imputed to him, and &s;o candidly con|fe&s;&s;ed and &s;o feelingly lamented the follies, which he had com|mitted, that the Count was confirmed in the belief of all he had hoped; and, while he perceived &s;o many noble virtues in Valan|court,
<PB N="230" REF="029378_0342_0FE088FE51064AA8">
and that experience had taught him to dete&s;t the follies, which before he had only not admired, he did not &s;cruple to believe, that be would pa&s;s through life with the dignity of a wi&s;e and good man, or to entru&s;t to his care the future happine&s;s of Emily St. Aubert, for whom he felt the &s;olicitude of a parent. Of this he &s;oon informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, in a &s;hort conver&s;ation, when Valancourt had left him. While Emily li&s;tened to a relation of the &s;ervices, that Valancourt had ren|dered Mon&s;. Bonnac. her eyes overflowed with tears of plea&s;ure, and the further conver&s;ation of Count De Villefort perfectly di&s;&s;ipated every doubt, as to the pa&s;t and future conduct of him, to whom &s;he now re&s;tored, without fear, the e&s;teem and affection, with which &s;he had formerly received him.</P>
<P>When they returned to the &s;upper room, the Counte&s;s and Lady Blanche met Valancourt with &s;incere congratulations; and Blanche, indeed, was &s;o much rejoiced to &s;ee Emily returned to happine&s;s, as to forget for a while, that Mon&s;. St. Foix was not yet arrived at the chateau, though he had been expected for &s;ome hours; but her gen|erous &s;ympathy was, &s;oon after, rewarded by his appearance. He was now perfectly recovered from the wounds, received, during his perilous adventure among the Pyrenees, the mention of which &s;erv|ed to heighten to the parties, who had been involved in it, the &s;en&s;e of their pre&s;ent happine&s;s. New congratulations pa&s;&s;ed between them, and round the &s;upper table appeared a group of faces, &s;miling with felicity, but with a felicity, which had in each a different char|acter. The &s;mile of Blanche was frank and gay, that of Emily ten|der and pen&s;ive; Valancourt's was rapturous, tender and gay alter|nately; Mon&s;. St. Foix's was joyous, and that of the Count, as he looked on the &s;urrounding party, expre&s;&s;ed the tempered complacen|cy of benevolence; while the features of the Counte&s;s. He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, and Mon&s;. Bonnac, di&s;covered fainter traces of animation. Poor Mon&s;. Du Pont did not, by his pe&s;ence, throw a &s;hade of regret over the company; for, when he had di&s;covered, that Valancourt was not un|worthy of the e&s;teem of Emily, he determined &s;eriou&s;ly to endeavour at the conque&s;t of his own hopele&s;s affection, and had immediately withdrawn from Chateau-la-Blanc&mdash;a conduct, which Emily now un|der&s;tood, and rewarded with her admiration and pity.</P>
<P>The Count and his gue&s;ts continued together till a late hour, yield|ing to the delights of &s;ocial gaiety, and to the &s;weets of friend&s;hip. When Annette heard of the arrival of Valancourt, Ludovico had &s;ome difficulty to prevent her going into the &s;upper room, to expre&s;s her joy, for &s;he declared, that &s;he had never been &s;o rejoiced at any <HI>accident</HI> as this, &s;ince &s;he had found Ludovico him&s;elf.</P>

<P>THE marriages of the Lady Blanche and Emily St. Aubert were celebrated, on the &s;ame day, and with the ancient baronial magnifi|cence, at Chateau-le-Blanc. The fea&s;ts were held in the great hall of the ca&s;tle, which, on this occa&s;ion, was hung with &s;uperb new ta|pe&s;try; repre&s;enting the exploits of Charlemagne and his twelve peers; here, were &s;een the Saracens, with their horrible vi&s;ors, advancing to battle; and there, were di&s;played the wild &s;olemnities of incantation, and the necromantic feats, exhibited by the magician Jarl before the Emperor. The &s;umptuous banners of the family of Villeroi, which had long &s;lept in du&s;t, were once more unfurled, to wave over the goth|ic points of painted ca&s;ements; and mu&s;ic echoed, in many a lin|gering clo&s;e, through every winding gallery and colonnade of that va&s;t edifice.</P>
<P>As Annette looked down from the corridor upon the hall, who&s;e arches and windows were illuminated with brilliant fe&s;toons of lamps, and gazed on the &s;plendid dre&s;&s;es of the dancers, the co&s;tly liveries of the attendants, the canopies of purple velvet and gold, and li&s;ten|ed to the gay &s;trains that floated along the vaulted roof, &s;he almo&s;t fan|cied her&s;elf in an inchanted palace, and declared, that &s;he had not met with any place, which charmed her &s;o much, &s;ince &s;he read the fairy tales; nay, that the fairies them&s;elves, at their nightly revels in this old hall, could di&s;play nothing finer; while old Dorothee, as &s;he &s;ur|veyed the &s;cene, &s;ighed, and &s;aid, the ca&s;tle looked as it was wont to do in the time of her youth.</P>
<P>After gracing the fe&s;tivities of Chateau-le-Blanc, for &s;ome days Val|ancourt and Emily took leave of their kind friends, and returned to La Vallee, where the faithful There&s;a received them with unfeigned joy, and the plea&s;ant &s;hades welcomed them with a thou&s;and tender and affecting remembrances; and, while they wandered together over the &s;cenes, &s;o long inhabited by the late Mon&s;. and Madame St. Aubert, and Emily pointed out, with pen&s;ive affection, their favourite haunts, her pre&s;ent happine&s;s was heightened, by con&s;idering, that it would have been worthy of their approbation, could they have witne&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Valancourt led her to the plane tree on the terrace, where he had fir&s;t ventured to declare his love, and where now the remembrance of the anxiety he had then &s;uffered, and the retro&s;pect of all the dangers and misfortunes they had each encountered, &s;ince la&s;t they &s;at together be|neath its broad branches, exalted the &s;en&s;e of their pre&s;ent felicity, which, on this &s;pot, &s;acred to &s;he memory of St. Aubert, they &s;ol|emnly vowed to de&s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, as far as po&s;&s;ible, by endeavouring to imitate his benevolence,&mdash;by remembering, that &s;uperior attainments of every

fort bring with them duties of &s;uperior exertion, and by affording to their fellow beings, together with that portion of ordinary comforts, which pro&s;perity always owes to misfortune, the example of lives pa&s;&s;ed in happy thankfulne&s;s to GOD, and, therefore, in careful ten|derne&s;s to his creatures.</P>
<P>Soon after their return to La Vallee, the brother of Valancourt came to congratulate him on his marriage, and to pay his re&s;pects to Emily&punc; with whom he was &s;o much plea&s;ed, as well as with the pro&s;|pect of rational happine&s;s, which the&s;e nuptials offered to Valancourt, that he immediately re&s;igned to him a part of the rich domain, the whole of which, as he had no family, would of cour&s;e de&s;cend to his brother, on his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>The e&s;tates, at Tholou&s;e, were di&s;po&s;ed of, and Emily purcha&s;ed of Mon&s;. Que&s;nel the ancient domain of her late father, where, hav|ing given Annette a marriage portion, &s;he &s;ettled her as the hou&s;ekeep|er, and Ludovico as the &s;teward; but, &s;ince both Valancourt and her|&s;elf preferred the plea&s;ant and long loved &s;hades of La Vallee to the magnificence of Epourville, they continued to re&s;ide there, pa&s;&s;ing, however, a few months in the year at the birth place of St. Aubert, in tender re&s;pect to his memory.</P>
<P>The legacy, which had been bequeathed to Emily by Signora Lau|rentini, &s;he begged Valancourt would allow her to re&s;ign to Mon&s;. Bonnac; and Valancourt, when &s;he made the reque&s;t, felt all the value of the compliment it conveyed. The ca&s;tle of Udolpho al&s;o, de&s;cended to the wife of Mon&s;. Bonnac, who was the neare&s;t &s;urviv|ing relation of the hou&s;e of that name, and thus affluence re&s;tored his long oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits to peace, and his family to comfort.</P>
<P>O! how joyful it is to tell of happine&s;s, &s;uch as that of Valan|court and Emily; to relate, that, after &s;uffering under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the vicious and the di&s;dain of the weak, they were, at length, re|&s;tored to each other&mdash;to the beloved land&s;capes of their native coun|try&mdash;to the &s;ecure&s;t felicity of this life that of a&s;piring to moral and labouring for intellectual improvement&mdash;to the plea&s;ures of enlight|ened &s;ociety, and to the exerci&s;e of the benevolence which had always animated their hearts; while the bowers of La Vallee become, once more, the retreat of goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom and dome&s;tic ble&s;&s;edne&s;s!</P>
<P>O! u&s;eful may it be to have &s;hewn, that, though the vicious can &s;ometimes pour affliction upon the good, their power is tran&s;ient and their puni&s;hment certain; and that innocence, though oppre&s;&s;ed by inju&s;tice, &s;hall, &s;upported by patience, finally triumph over misfortune.</P>
<P>And if the weak hand, that has recorded this tale, has, by its &s;cenes, beguiled the mourner of one hour of &s;orrow, or, by its moral, taught him to &s;u&s;tain it&mdash;the effort, however humble, has not been vain, nor is the writer unrewarded.</P>
