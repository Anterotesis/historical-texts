<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends, Country-men, and Fellow-Soldiers;</SALUTE> Favor me, I be&s;eech you, with your attention and candor.</OPENER>
<P>I COME, in compliance with the mournful call of this day, to offer my hone&s;t endea|vors, as well as to unite my mo&s;t &s;incere zeal with this honorable A&s;&s;embly, in paying re|&s;pect to the memory of our worthy decea&s;ed General.</P>
<P>No labors nor expences, as we are a&s;&s;ured in hi&s;tory, were ever neglected by wi&s;e and gallant na|tions, which in any manner could honor and per|petuate the memories of great and illu&s;trious men.</P>

<P>WHEN living characters of worth and excellence are the objects of our daily and plea&s;ing contem|plation, or, by recollection, we bring into view tho&s;e of pa&s;t ages, and are per&s;uaded, that, by zealous imitation of them, we can advance to great degrees of pre-eminence in honor and virtue; then, a generous emulation is kindled in our bo&s;oms, and we are animated, and even charmed to &s;urpa&s;s others in glory and excellence: for good examples po&s;&s;e&s;s the inchanting powers of per&s;ua&s;ion, even when they are cloathed with the important dignity

of in&s;truction. And our own experience mu&s;t have taught us, that their influence is more exten&s;ive and powerful than that of the mo&s;t accurate and profound rea&s;onings. By extraordinary examples our admiration is excited, our vigor and re&s;olution are drawn into action, and we are led on to glori|ous atchievments. On this account we find that, not only ju&s;tice, always faithful to excellent cha|racters, demanded honor and re&s;pect for their pre|cious memories; but al&s;o the public intere&s;t of mankind required &s;uch u&s;eful characters to be pro|po&s;ed as patterns worthy the imitation of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>WITH a laudable de&s;ign of kindling a generous emulation of the be&s;t examples, and of always pre|&s;erving this pure and VESTAL flame alive; the anti|ent republics directed their orators to pronounce eulogiums over their decea&s;ed heroes and patriots, before they committed their bodies to the funeral pile.</P>

<P>AN exalted motive this!

<P>BE this then the improvement of the pre&s;ent day's tran&s;action; this the advantage we will &s;trive to obtain even from the lo&s;s of a worthy citizen, a brave and virtuous man, we will con&s;ider by what means we may with dignity approach that eternal

<P>BY po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing true virtue, we &s;hall be furni&s;hed with the e&s;&s;ential qualifications for ending this life gloriou&s;ly, and leaving an illu&s;trious character be|hind us which will &s;peak for us, we being dead, and prolong our u&s;efulne&s;s far beyond the narrow compa&s;s of a few years in which our pre&s;ent lives are circum&s;cribed.</P>
<P>HONORABLY to pur&s;ue &s;uch heroic and immor|tal fame, as the greate&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful men have acquired, is the true glory which their examples point out to us and encourage us to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT though a love of fame is found in almo&s;t every brea&s;t, yet that de&s;ire and expectation of gaining it only are innocent and laudable which re|&s;ult

from virtuous actions. True fame and la&s;t|ing glory are founded upon the rock virtue, and &s;hall outla&s;t the flight of ages and the mo&s;t dura|ble memorials of human &s;tructure.</P>
<P>WHEN the brazen &s;tatue and the &s;culptured mar|ble &s;hall become faithle&s;s to their charges, and they &s;hall them&s;elves crumble to du&s;t; even then, true glory, the fir&s;t born of virtue, &s;ub&s;tantial virtue, &s;hall uphold an immortal duration: but fal&s;e glory, built upon a &s;elfi&s;h and contracted foundation, &s;hall tot|ter and fall in di&s;graceful ruin, like a fabric rai&s;ed on the un&s;table &s;and. May this therefore be the rich profit which we will endeavor to derive from the be&s;t and noble&s;t characters; they &s;hall teach us not to gra&s;p &s;o much at the airy vi&s;ion of a mo|mentary name, as to covet, and therefore po&s;&s;e&s;s all tho&s;e virtues out of which true fame and &s;ublime glory will grow and flouri&s;h, without the danger of ever fading.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017150_0008_0FA06EB1A2928660">THE character of the famous Cato of Rome will inform us how much he loved his country and e&s;teemed the practice of virtue above the applau&s;e of mankind, even though a regard to the ju&s;t appro|bation which our fellow-men owe unto us is inno|cent and lawful,</P>
<P>CATO fled from fame, but &s;he pur&s;ued him with the greater &s;peed. He cho&s;e to be virtuous rather than appear &s;o; he preferred that &s;elf approbation which ari&s;es from meritorious actions, to the change|able and tumultuous acclamations of the fickle mul|titude.&mdash;From this, as well as other examples of worth beyond number, we are induced to &s;ay that men can never travel in the road of true glory, but when they are employed in the &s;ervice of their country, and for the benefit of their fellow-citizens and friends, and are ju&s;tly entitled to their appro|bation and prai&s;e. That approbation and prai&s;e, we

&s;ay, which are devoted to them by their fellow-citizens, and unalterably confirmed by the voice of every good man. And, if I were here permitted to enrich this humble page with a name known and loved by every friend to ju&s;tice and liberty, I would &s;ay, &s;uch united and univer&s;al love and prai&s;e are ju&s;tly devoted to the character of * * * * * * And the God of all goodne&s;s has in mercy to the Ame|rican army pre&s;ented us with a man who&s;e example is mo&s;t worthy our imitation.</P>
<P>NEITHER the abundance of wealth, nor the un|limitted gratification of &s;en&s;ual appetites, nor the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power formidable to liberty, and too often intolerable: none of the&s;e can bribe the voice of divine ju&s;tice to pronounce that man truly great who is de&s;titute of noble and virtuous actions, to entitle him to &s;o great a reward. True merit on|ly, has a righteous demand on true glory, and yet it &s;eldom makes this lawful demand.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="017150_0010_0FA06EB225CAF128">HERE then we will fix our determination: that man is eminently great who is truly good, for uni|ted, they happily con&s;pire to form a &s;ublime and dignified character. The &s;olid ba&s;is of permanent glory and happine&s;s, is true religion, and the appro|bation of that ble&s;&s;ed Being, who is worthy of all veneration, is the &s;ublime reward which animates the good man through life, and, at death, crowns him with <HI>glory and honor and immortality.</HI> For as the Poet &s;ays,
<Q><L>Let the witling argue all he can,</L>
<L>'Tis Religion &s;till that makes the man.</L></Q>
Mo&s;t happy then is that man who having a truly public &s;pirit and an enlarged and catholic &s;oul in the &s;ervice of mankind, does yet, above all things, &s;olicit the love and favor of his infinitely wi&s;e Cre|ator, who being acquainted with all his virtuous in|tentions, however much they may be concealed from the imperfect view of &s;hort &s;ighted mortals!

Plea&s;ing con&s;ideration to the virtuous mind! An all wi&s;e and merciful God is the Judge of the good man's actions, and perfectly knowing their weight and value, will give them their equitable reward.</P>
<P>OH, divine virtue! Methinks thou ha&s;t charms and beauties &s;ufficient to court and captivate the love and admiration of every rational being. It is virtue which dignifies both life and death: Oh let my brea&s;t be ever one of thy fair habitations, and there deign to &s;way thy peaceful &s;ceptre, until all my inclinations and pa&s;&s;ions are &s;weetly and power|fully &s;ubjected to the laws of unchangeable recti|tude! Thou gentle dove of happine&s;s, ever bring|ing the olive branch of peace to the mind of the good man! Mild angel, of heavenly birth, daily whi&s;pering in the &s;ofte&s;t accents, &s;weet innocence and &s;eraphic joy to the &s;miling con&s;cience! Bright and un&s;potted con&s;cience, thou approving &s;pirit,

lovely daughter of virtue, &s;i&s;ter to the pure ho&s;ts of the Cherubim, and be&s;t companion of Arch-an|gels.&mdash;</P>
<P>I HOPE then it is evident to all of us, that tho&s;e examples are mo&s;t worthy our careful imitation, which have the large&s;t portion of moral goodne&s;s united to the mo&s;t heroic and patriotic abilities. True piety &s;hould be the vital and animating prin|ciple of all our pur&s;uits, and we ought to con&s;ider it the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t obligation which is laid on us: and indeed the duties of love and reverence to God are &s;o ju&s;t and important, that without them no character can be complete. Suppo&s;e many u&s;e|ful and excellent qualifications may ju&s;tly di&s;tin|gui&s;h a man, and let it be granted, that he has a comparative dignity; yet the want of love to the kind parent of the univer&s;e will be found &s;o great

a blemi&s;h in his character as to tarni&s;h all the re&s;t of his boa&s;ted excellencies.</P>
<P>BUT when I &s;ay a character excellent in many u&s;eful qualifications among men, is not complete; do I di&s;courage the cultivation of tho&s;e heroic pa|triotic and other abilities and qualifications by which the cau&s;e and intere&s;t of men are &s;upported? Not by any means I hope. I wi&s;h the world all the happine&s;s and dignity which can po&s;&s;ibly be ob|tained from what&s;oever generous and laudable mo|tives they may be pur&s;ued: but de&s;pairing ever to &s;ee mankind in a happy and flouri&s;hing &s;tate, un|le&s;s they unite the love of the great di&s;po&s;er of all events with the generous &s;ervice of the public in|tere&s;t; I am con&s;trained to intreat all my fellow|men, as far as I am able, to lay the foundation of their u&s;efulne&s;s and future glory, on true piety to God, and then they will be &s;ure to &s;tand immova|ble.

Does this appear unrea&s;onable or impractica|ble? Shall we not find it more ea&s;y to follow the dictates of rea&s;on and con&s;cience than to oppo&s;e them?&mdash;</P>
<P>ARE we plea&s;ed with a good human character, and powerfully di&s;po&s;ed to admire what is ex|cellent in it; and can we, without offering violence to our rea&s;on and intere&s;t, withold our love and grateful admiration of the infinite rectitude, the un&s;potted purity, and the uncreated excellence, goodne&s;s, and omnipotence of the Mo&s;t High? Do we feel the principles of gratitude warmly excited within us, and our pa&s;&s;ions laid under a weighty &s;en&s;e of the many acts of kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity our benefactors have conferred on us? And can we refu&s;e to be grateful to our Creator, our pre&s;erver and mo&s;t bountiful benefactor, and the eternal &s;ource of all that is good and glorious in the whole

creation? A character therefore without the&s;e pi|ous affections mu&s;t be very defective in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites, and can not have the true&s;t dig|nity; for it is de&s;titute of that which is of all things mo&s;t rea&s;onable, mo&s;t plea&s;ing, and which gives a lu&s;tre to all our actions. And what is this but piety, which is no more than the exerci&s;e of love, re&s;pect and gratitude to the author of all good. Let us then be invited to make the character of the Supreme Being the fir&s;t object of our love and veneration, and let us follow the exhortation of our Saviour. <HI>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Fa|ther which is in Heaven is perfect.</HI> And may we <HI>mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</HI></P>

Has it attempted to teach us the certainty of dying, and the near approach of our exit? This was not thought nece&s;&s;ary among men who exerci&s;e their rea&s;on and reflection; but to remind us how we may die with dignity, and ar|rive at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of true glory. The be&s;t pa&s;|&s;age from life to death has been pointed out to us, and virtue has been offered to pilot us &s;afe from all the &s;hoals and rocks of vice and ruin, into the haven of cele&s;tial glory. Under the convoy of this hea|venly guide we need not fear the approach of death, nor turn pale at the &s;ight of an opened grave.

<P>BUT am I come to make the approach of Death alarming and terrible? Did I come to unma&s;k the gha&s;tly tyrant, and to repre&s;ent the groans and ago|nies of the la&s;t conflict? No, my friends.

<P>I WILL not pre&s;ume to determine how far the ve|ry amiable and u&s;eful character of our worthy friend and much lamented General, corre&s;ponded with tho&s;e examples and characters of true glory which I have attempted to de&s;cribe: for I mu&s;t venture to u&s;e the freedom of &s;aying he was my friend, and I loved him &s;incerely!</P>

Though the pre&s;ent emolument and the future &s;upport of a ri&s;ing family, together with the &s;weets of dome&s;tic happine&s;s, &s;eemed all with the fair &s;how of ju&s;tice, to con&s;pire in demanding his attention to them; yet, with a patriotic firmne&s;s, he put all their in|treaties a&s;ide, and cho&s;e rather to make a daily &s;acrifice of private intere&s;t and per&s;onal happine&s;s, and to &s;upport the cau&s;e of liberty, than to live in affluence when the liberties of his country were ex|piring.

<P>NOR were the virtues and abilities of our Gene|ral le&s;s con&s;picuous in the field. He was prudent in coun&s;el and &s;olid in judging, firm and &s;teady in his re&s;olutions, cautious of unnece&s;&s;ary danger, calm and undaunted in battle, vigorous and unwearied in obeying military commands, and executing en|terprizes; patient and per&s;evering under hard&s;hips

and difficulties, punctual and exact in the duties of the army. His mind ever engaged in promoting the good of the army, and in pre&s;erving order and regularity among tho&s;e troops he commanded: and far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch a narrow and impoveri&s;hed &s;oul as can be content with a bare e&s;cape from cen|&s;ure; he was ever willing and plea&s;ed to do as much as po&s;&s;ible, even though it were out of the immediate line of his military duty. He was af|fable and conde&s;cending, ea&s;y of acce&s;s, yet main|taining dignity, and commanding re&s;pect; ever &s;u&s;|taining an honorable command of his pa&s;&s;ions. He well knew how to re&s;pect, and he honored all cha|racters which were faithfully employed in the di&s;|charge of their duty, and he thought none, who were faithful and brave, beneath his notice. The &s;oldier under pre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s had free acce&s;s to him, and he was as a father to them! Yes, my dear fellow &s;oldiers, you who have been

<P>HIGH heaven, who&s;e will is ever right, has cal|led him from the &s;ocieties of men, and from acting his part, any longer, in this calamitous war, which we are involved in, by the ambition of the fooli&s;h tyrant of Britain.

<P>IN this place I think my&s;elf happy that I have his example to furni&s;h a &s;ub&s;tantial argument in &s;upport of a truth I have long labored to e&s;tabli&s;h.

Namely, that religion and true courage are no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with one another; but being united, mutually promote dignity and true glory. Many parts of the &s;acred writings might be adduced to &s;how that the generous zeal of the patriot and the un&s;haken intrepidity of the warrior, never appear with &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a lu&s;tre, as when they are a|dorned with the piety of the truly good man. How|ever, the&s;e divine examples and precepts being too numerous to repeat before you at pre&s;ent, and I hope too familiar to you to appear new, let us for a moment, at this time, turn our attention more particularly to the example before us. You gen|tlemen who now appear the di&s;con&s;olate mourners at this funeral &s;olemnity of our late beloved friend and General, and were in time pa&s;t the &s;ubjects of his more immediate command; you well remember how regular and un&s;potted were his life and man|ners! He was an unchangeable friend of the mo|ral and &s;ocial virtues, and taught the excellence of
<PB N="32" REF="017150_0031_0FA06ECC138B5F48">
them more by his amiable example than by a pom|pous parade of words without actions. He was an invariable advocate for public and divine wor&s;hip, never omitting to a&s;&s;emble the troops under his command, at the &s;tated time for this purpo&s;e, when the circum&s;tances of the army would permit, nor DISDAINING to pay his own per&s;onal attendance. Was this a blemi&s;h in his character? Did this in|jure his courage, or make him in&s;en&s;ible of the in|tere&s;t of his country? None of the&s;e things! His virtues laid the &s;olid foundation for all his other ex|cellences to build upon, and &s;tand immoveable a|mid&s;t all the &s;eeming ca&s;ualties of time.</P>
<P>NEED I &s;ay, that intemperance and profane&s;s, and every vice, were &s;trangers to him? Here let me ob&s;erve, for &s;uch an omi&s;&s;ion would be criminal, that during three years &s;ervice under his immedi|ate command, I never once knew him guilty of

But I &s;hould tre&s;|pa&s;s on your patience, by attempting to draw his character to its ju&s;t and full length, and rehear&s;e all his labors and &s;ervices &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war. From the time when he with his country, fir&s;t armed in oppo&s;ition to the cruelty and domination of Britain, and precious American blood was fir&s;t &s;hed in defence of our rights near Bo&s;ton. From Bo&s;ton to Canada, and from Cana|da to tho&s;e important fortre&s;&s;es on the lake Cham|plain, and from thence in various encounters, in toils of marches, and pains of hunger, until his troops fought the army of Burgoyne, on the heights of Behmus, where in repeated battles, and in the convention of Saratoga, he was entitled to a large &s;hare of tho&s;e laurels which crowned the American arms. The la&s;t year it was his lot, with many more, to dare the hard&s;hips of the wilderne&s;s, and traver&s;e a land, before unknown, as far as the Che|ne&s;&s;es,
<PB N="34" REF="017150_0033_0FA06ED0168555C8">
and it was by the troops under his command that the &s;avage enemy were defeated.</P>
<P>WHEN the pre&s;ent campaign opened, without &s;oliciting the po&s;t of honor and &s;uperior danger, or even knowing the intention of any new appoint|ment, his merit procured him the command of a Brigade of light infantry under the Honorable Ma|jor-General the Marquis de la Fayette. With plea&s;ure he accepted that command, de&s;irous of &s;er|ving the intere&s;t of his country more eminently in this &s;tation, and of emulating the generous zeal of him, who though not born in America, has made the cau&s;e of this continent his own, and has &s;pared neither blood nor trea&s;ure to e&s;tabli&s;h our Indepen|dence. Oh Americans, &s;erve your country with &s;uch unwearied zeal as this noble &s;on of France &s;erves you, then may we hope &s;ucce&s;s will attend our arms!</P>
<P>I &s;aid that our General, who&s;e lo&s;s we have la|mented, with plea&s;ure accepted the command

which was offered to him, eagerly panting to meet the enemy, and, under the direction of that Being in who&s;e hand is the fate of nations, to bring this war to an honorable and &s;peedy conclu&s;ion: But alas! in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e &s;anguine hopes and ex|pectations he was removed from the &s;ervice of the United States.</P>
<P>THUS do our di&s;appointed hopes and expecta|tions teach us the uncertainty of holding the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of earthly ble&s;&s;ings independent of the great Governor of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t words which I &s;hall addre&s;s to you on this occa&s;ion, and if they were to be the la&s;t I &s;hould ever utter for my country, I would mo&s;t earne&s;tly pray and be&s;eech you to lay the foundati|on of your future glory and happine&s;s on true re|ligion!
