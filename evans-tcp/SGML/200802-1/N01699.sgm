<P>PEr&s;ons of highe&s;t improvement in the world, are &s;ubject to the Laws of GOD as well as others, and no le&s;s expo&s;ed, (in ca&s;e of Sin) to the Wrath of the impartial Judge of the world, who <HI>accepts not the per&s;on of Princes, nor regards the Rich more than the poor.</HI> Men that are Exalted to the Higher Places of the Earth, are more out of the reach of Mans &s;hort Arm, but &s;till, as much as ever within the reach of an Omnipotent Arm; Indeed no place can be found, that will hide from God's Eye, or &s;ecure from his Hand; for he is &s;till above the highe&s;t Mountains, ea&s;ily overturns them in his Wrath, &amp; makes the Pillars of the Earth to Tremble. The various Orders of Men in the World, that look at, either the outward, or inward good of a People, are of God's appointing; And the Lawful Power, Civil or Sacred, that any are Inve&s;ted with, is from God, who is the Prime Seat, and

Original of all Power. The greate&s;t in Im|provement are but Servants in Gods Family, whom he Improves, as the In&s;truments of his Providence. It is he that Advances one to Rule, calls another near to Mini&s;ter, and to Ble&s;s in his Name; It is he that puts the Sword of Ju&s;tice into one Hand, and that of the Spirit into another; Charging tho&s;e that receive &s;uch Power, with the mo&s;t awful Authority, that they have a regard to his Ho|nour and Glory while they Improve the &s;ame in a Di&s;charge of the Duties of their places. And that they may not want Motive, to reach the main Springs of action in the Na|ture of Man, they are forewarned, that God will deal with them in Proportion to their Carriage &amp; Deportment towards Him, as is expre&s;&s;ed in the words Read; <HI>Them that Ho|nour me I will Honour, &amp; they that De&s;pi&s;e me &s;hall be lightly E&s;teemed.</HI></P>
<P>That God who did Sanctify the whole Seed of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to be a Holy and Peculiar People to him&s;elf, did &s;et apart <HI>Aaron &amp; his Sons</HI> to Mini&s;ter in the Prie&s;ts Office; And taught them, both by Precept and indeed, by Ter|rible things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that <HI>he would be Sanctifyed in them that came nigh him, and had in Reverence of all about him;</HI> yet the mo&s;t clear, and often repeated Precepts, the mo&s;t forcea|ble Motives, were not Sufficient to keep Alive

in their Hearts, a &s;en&s;e of their Duty, &amp; a care to attend it. That People had not been long Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Holy Land, before they defil'd it; they quickly turn'd out of the way; And there was not only a grievous Corruption in the Body of the People, but the mo&s;t Sa|cred order of men were Defiled; the Cove|nant of <HI>Levi</HI> was Corrupted; tho&s;e that hand|led the Law, and were by Office&punc; Obliged to teach others the Knowlege of God, were them&s;elves &s;hamefully Ignorant of him; and they that Mini&s;tred before the Lord with Clean Garments did it with Filthy &amp; Impure Souls. It was little better than this, in <HI>Eli's</HI> time, when his Prophane Sons Mini&s;tred un|der him in the Prie&s;ts Office; as appears by the Character given of them. (1) As to the di&s;po&s;ition and &s;tate of their Souls, they were <HI>Sons of Belial,</HI> they <HI>Knew not the Lord, Ver&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> (2) As to their Conduct of them&s;elves, they were Intemperate, Indulging them&s;elves in unclean Lu&s;ts <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 22.

Not content with the bountiful Allowance of Hea|ven: God had not been an hard Ma&s;ter to them, he did not require them to kindle a Fire on his Altar for nought; but had made them partakers with him&s;elf at the Altar; be|&s;ides the large Provi&s;ions other ways made for

their Comfortable and Honourable Support, God had allowed them, certain Portions out of the Offerings made by Fire unto him&s;elf; they were not content therewith, but in a Sacrilegious manner, did Sei&s;e on Gods Part; And Snatch to them&s;elves out of the be&s;t of it, to &s;atisfy their lu&s;ting Appetite: Be&s;ides they liked not the Appointed way of its being prepared for U&s;e; Neither would &s;tay until God was Served; whereby Foul Indignities were offered unto God, and the Holy things of God were brought into Contempt; for on the&s;e accounts, Men De&s;pi&s;ed the Offerings of the Lord: The&s;e things were highly Pro|voking to a Holy and Jealous God; he &s;ends a Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Eli</HI> rather than to his Sons, who was look'd on as a partaker with them in their Sins, in that he had not Interpo&s;ed his Au|thority, either as a Parent, or an High Prie&s;t, for their Reformation or at lea&s;t Re&s;traint.

In the Words Read, we have an <HI>Honourable Work Propounded,</HI> and an <HI>Encouraging Reward Promi&s;ed.</HI></P>

Honour is a Word that is often u&s;ed and indeed taken in various &s;en&s;es; an Enumeration is needle&s;s, and would be tedious. It may &s;uffice to ob&s;erve the meaning mu&s;t be determined by the Party or Object to whom it is to be Paid; Now the Object here mentioned, is GOD him&s;elf; A Being Exalted far above all Ble&s;&s;ing &amp; Prai&s;e; &amp; therefore it cannot be by adding any Lu&s;tre or Glory to him, but by &s;uch actions as hold forth great thoughts of God, do become his Excellency &amp; tend to his Prai&s;e. We are to con&s;ider, that God is a Being of all Po&s;&s;ible Perfection; we are Creatures that are full of Im|perfections; and therefore we can add nothing to God; yet are we Creatures Capable of en|tertaining &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the Perfection, Ex|cellency &amp; Glory of God, &amp; of expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame in agreeable Actions, &s;uch Actions as are becoming his Excellency; and when we do &s;o, God is plea&s;ed to account it an Honour done to Him.

to all: Indeed &s;uch per&s;ons have greater Ad|vantages in their hands for the Glorifying of God, &amp; God expects a greater tribute of Ho|nour &amp; Glory from them: But it is a Work Propounded unto all, &amp; indeed fitted for every one; Not below the Highe&s;t, nor above the Meane&s;t, but well &s;uiting the Nature of Man, &amp; appointed to every one; indeed the very End of Mans Being, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life, the Sum of his Duty.</P>

Hence the Words afford this Doctrine;</P>
<P>DOCT. GOD will be&s;tow Honour on &s;uch as Honour Him.</P>
<P>Honour is one of tho&s;e things the Mind of Man does Naturally de&s;ire &amp; reach after, &amp; not in Vain. The wi&s;e Author of Nature has univer&s;ally fitted &amp; apportioned an Object to each natural Power. There is undoubtedly an Honour that is proportioned to a rea&s;onable nature, &amp; often propounded unto Man as wor|thy of his de&s;ire, &amp; to be reached after, as be|longing to the Perfection &amp; Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of his Nature. We read, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5. 44. Of an <HI>Honour that comes from God only,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the Honour that comes from Man, &s;o that its a Good that is both Real, &amp; Great, giving true Advancement to the Creature: And therefore, there is an Ambition of Mind after it that is truly Laudable; but as it is aptly Expre&s;&s;ed by one,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop <HI>Hall.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nature has dim Eyes &amp; they are mi&s;placed, not thereby di&s;cerning where, or in what her Hap|pine&s;s lies, or how to come at it.</HI> And hence it is, that the Attempts of Multitudes are Vain &amp; Fruitle&s;s. Men are mi&s;taken in the Object: There are &s;undry things that are but the Picture, Appearance, or Shadow of true Ho|nour;
<PB N="9" REF="002017_0010_0FBA85C3A04C47B0">
&s;uch as <HI>Great</HI> Titles, <HI>Humane</HI> Applau&s;e, Place of <HI>Power &amp; Command,</HI> Splendid <HI>Living,</HI> Honourable <HI>Attendance, &amp;c.</HI> Which are u&s;ual|ly mi&s;taken by Men, for the true Object; and in pur&s;uit of the&s;e, men do oftentimes &s;train &amp; tire them&s;elves to no purpo&s;e; and if at any time they are Gained, they Advance little, add but little of Lu&s;tre to the Enjoyers; after all, Per&s;ons having nothing but the&s;e to Advance or Adorn them, they are but as a worthle&s;s <HI>Ro|mance</HI> under a <HI>Guilded Cover;</HI> or a very <HI>&s;mall Letter</HI> in the mid&s;t of a <HI>great Gay;</HI> the Man may notwith&s;tanding all this be very mean &amp; contemptible in the account of true Wi&s;dom. Now, Religion which de&s;igns the true Happi|ne&s;s &amp; be&s;t Good of Man, makes Di&s;covery of the true Object; tells what <HI>true Honour</HI> is, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts; rai&s;es up, &amp; helps the Mind of man to Di&s;cern it, &amp; pre&s;cribes a &s;ure way to Attain it; a way that has been oftentimes tryed &amp; found Effectual; &amp; this is by Vertu|ous Actions; In &s;hort, by Honouring God. Religion does in its own Nature tend to rai&s;e up &amp; ennoble the Mind of man, &amp; Adorn it with a greater Lu&s;tre &amp; Glory than a Multitude of empty Titles can po&s;&s;ibly do; but be&s;ides, hereby Per&s;ons are entitled to the free &amp; rich Promi&s;e of God, who has &s;aid, <HI>That he will Ho|nour them that Honour him.</HI></P>

<P>Its a matter that con&s;i&s;ts mainly in Action; indeed Speech &amp; the in&s;trument thereof were given to Prai&s;e God with, &amp; not to ly Silent; however, there is more in this than only &s;ome Verbal Prai&s;es; Chri&s;t him&s;elf has taught us thus, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15. 8 <HI>Herein is my Father Glorifyed that ye bear much Fruit.</HI> And it was by Action that he him&s;elf Glorifyed God. <HI>Joh.</HI> 17. 4. <HI>I have Glorifyed thee on earth, I have Fini&s;hed the Work given me to do.</HI> But then,</P>
<P>Its by &s;uch Actions as proceed from, &amp; te&s;ti|fy the great thoughts that are had of God, &amp; are intended, &amp; directed to his Prai&s;e. It is not enough to perform &s;uch Actions as relate to God, &amp; have been Commanded by him; but they mu&s;t flow from this Principle, and be di|rected to this end, otherwi&s;e whatever may be the end of the Work, this is not the end of the Workman; &amp; therefore an Act or Work that finds acceptance &amp; applau&s;e with Man, may be
