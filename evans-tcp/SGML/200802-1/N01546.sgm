<P>THE Sea&s;onablene&s;s and Coincidence of Di&s;cour&s;es of the Grace of God, with the pre&s;ent workings of Pro|vidence, and the great de&s;igns of Grace towards us Men, that the Soveraign Lord of all purpo&s;eth to put in Execution in the&s;e latter Dayes, together with their tendency to animate and excite unto a Co-opperating with Him therein are not unea&s;ily di&s;cerned; And would Men, e&s;pecially the Princes and Great Men of the World, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be per&s;waded to work with Him therein, and put their hands unto an advancement thereof, as in other ways, &s;o by putting Men into Publick Po&s;ts and Stations; and particu|larly the Work of the Mini&s;try, and Encouraging and Supporting them therein, that are qualified and &s;pi|rited hereunto, as they would manife&s;t their truely Noble and Heroic temper, and in the be&s;t manner that may be, con&s;ult their own Intere&s;t &amp; Honour; &s;o it would be an happy Omen, and attended with <HI>God's dwelling among&s;t Men, the Earths yielding her Increa&s;e,</HI> and all manner of Out|ward Pro&s;perity. Wherefore it is much to be de|&s;ired,
<PB REF="001839_0004_0FB9180DDA69DB28">
and heartily implored, that Men would give over their petty contrivances and doings, to (chiefly and in the fir&s;t place) &s;et forward their own hu|mours and &s;atisfactions, as if they were &s;o many <HI>Deities,</HI> and apply them&s;elves principally unto this De&s;ign. The Author of the following Short Tract, &s;uppo&s;ed that perhaps others, that are more adorned with both Natural and Acquired Endowments may thereby be jogged in their E&s;&s;ays this way. And if there are &s;ome hints therein, at a various hypothe&s;is concerning the Spirits carrying on the work of His Grace in Men, from what &s;ome Great and Venera|ble Per&s;onages have fallen in with, yet it is in it &s;elf &s;uch as is &s;o far from clouding the Glory that He aims at in the&s;e His doings, as that by His working in the way herein pointed at, His Wi&s;dom, Power and Mercy are more di&s;played, than they would be in Operating in the other. And he &s;up|po&s;eth, that all that may be oppo&s;ed again&s;t it, may be ea&s;ily An&s;wered. But yet it is onely &s;ugge&s;ted hypothetically and &s;ubmitted; it being one of the Artifices of Folly &amp; Satan to confound laudable De&s;igns, by throwing Men into vain janglings about means and le&s;s E&s;&s;ential matters leading to the End. May the God of all Grace by His Di&s;pen&s;ations and Love &amp; Kindne&s;s to us <HI>transform us into His Likene&s;s</HI> &amp; make us <HI>to be Holy.</HI> Which is the Prayer of your Unworthy Servant.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EPH. II. 5</HI></BIBL>
<P>By Grace are ye Saved.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle in this and the pre|ceding Chapter lays before us the Original and Fountain, and the Meritorious cau&s;e of our <HI>Salvation,</HI> the way where|in we are brought thereunto, and God's end in &s;aving of us; that the &s;pring and fir&s;t ri&s;e thereof lies in the free <HI>Election</HI> of the Father, that we are &s;aved through the <HI>Redemption</HI> that is in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> that the way wherein we are brought to Salvation is by the Lord's <HI>Con|verting us,</HI> and that his <HI>End</HI> in &s;aving us is the <HI>Prai&s;e &amp; Honour of His Glorious Grace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="001839_0006_0FB9181259BEA320">The&s;e Words lie in that part of his Di&s;|cour&s;e that gives an account of the way wherein we are brought to participate in the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s purcha&s;ed for us by Chri&s;t the Lord. And for the more full under&s;tanding this clau&s;e, the&s;e things may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by Grace here, we are to under|&s;tand <HI>the free favour of God.</HI> This word is u&s;ed in Sacred Writ principally in two No|tions. Very generally it &s;ignifies as much as free and unde&s;erved favour. I &s;hall mention only two Places, wherein it is u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e, namely, Gen. 6.8. <HI>But Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord,</HI> that is, he found favour in the Lords Eyes, and He freely &s;et His love upon Him. The other is, Tit. 2.7. <HI>That being ju&s;tified by his Grace</HI>; that is, of His Free and Sovereign Mercy we are Ju&s;tified, as the pre|ceding <HI>Context</HI> undeniably &s;hews. But then &s;ometimes we are to under&s;tand by it, the fruits of the Mercy and Sovereign Grace of God. In this acceptation the word is u&s;ed, Heb. 12.28. <HI>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom, which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, where|by we may &s;erve God acceptably,</HI> that is to &s;ay, let us have the holy Inclinations &amp; Di&s;po&s;itions enabling &amp; di&s;po&s;ing to &s;erve God acceptably. See al&s;o, 2 Cor. 8 6. <HI>In&s;omuch that we de&s;ired Titus that as he had begun, &s;o he would al&s;o fini&s;h
<PB N="3" REF="001839_0007_0FB91814AB2D19C0">
in you the &s;ame Grace al&s;o</HI>; that is, we de&s;ired <HI>Titus</HI> that as he had begun to further you in your charitable Contributions, &s;o he would promote, excite, direct and perfect you there|in; and the rea&s;on why the&s;e and &s;uch things as the&s;e are called by this name, and have this Denomination put upon them, is becau&s;e they are the fruits of the Grace and unmerited Mercy of God. It is the former notion that the Word is here u&s;ed, and when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>By Grace are ye &s;aved,</HI> his meaning is, that our Salvation is the fruit of God's Rich Mer|cy and Sovereign Love, as you may &s;ee if you read the <HI>Context,</HI> and particularly the Fourth, and the preceding part of this Ver&s;e. <HI>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love where|with he loved us, even when we were dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins hath quickened us together with Chri&s;t,</HI> (<HI>by Grace are ye &s;aved.</HI>) His &s;aying here <HI>by Grace are ye &s;aved</HI> is an inculcation and repetition of what he had &s;aid in the pre|ceding Words, of their quickening, its being an effect and fruit of the rich Mercy and great Love of God to us.</P>
<P>But 2ly. We may take Notice what is meant by the <HI>Salvation</HI> here &s;poken of. <HI>By Grace are ye &s;aved</HI> The Apo&s;tle has an e&s;pe|cial re&s;pect herein, unto that part of our Sal|vation, lying in our recovery and enlarge|ment
<PB N="4" REF="001839_0008_0FB91818E257A428">
from under the tyranny and dominion of Sin whereof he had been treating in the words immediately preceding, and which he had declared to come from the love of God: But he has al&s;o an eye therein unto the whole of that Deliverance and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s that we have, and obtain by Chri&s;t in this mortal e&s;tate, and after this Life. And this Word <HI>Salvation</HI> is very commonly u&s;ed in this &s;ig|nification. As for In&s;tance, <HI>Tit</HI> 2.11. <HI>Heb</HI> 2.3, 10. And the rea&s;on why he thus re|peats what he &s;aid ju&s;t before, and had &s;o plainly in general taught in the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, and pointed at, was becau&s;e he was deeply affected with this matter, would im|pre&s;s upon us an abiding &s;en&s;e of it, that our Salvation in every part of it, is of Grace, and that the Lord might have the whole honour of our Salvation, and be Glorious in the eyes of Men and Angels, for ever, upon the ac|count hereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Argument</HI> or <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI> that we propo&s;e from the Words thus opened is this,
<Q>That our Salvation is of Meer Grace.</Q></P>
<P>It is of no &s;mall Importance and Concern|ment upon many accounts, that we believe
<PB N="5" REF="001839_0009_0FB91819DB9ED0E8">
this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and grow and increa&s;e in our a&s;&s;urances of the truth thereof. Wherefore &s;undry things will be propo&s;ed and laid down that may &s;ub&s;erve unto that end.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> that may be offer|ed in Evidence of the Truth hereof is, That all we do until we are actually brought into an e&s;tate of Grace or intirely &s;aved, <HI>is Sin.</HI> Not but that many, that are not in an e&s;tate of Salvation, behave them&s;elves orderly and well, and live vertuous lives. Multitudes of the peri&s;hing Per&s;ons that live in places of Go&s;pel Light are very cleanly in their de|portment, as they ab&s;tain from &s;candalous Im|moralities, &s;o they are con&s;iderably and in more then a few in&s;tances obedient unto the Precepts of the Law, and that in part from principles of Con&s;cience. Yea as to many duties of Morality they exceed, &amp; go beyond &s;ome that are made Partakers of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And the &s;ame will hold with re&s;pect unto many of the Heathen. Hi&s;tory informs us, that among&s;t the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> and <HI>Greci|ans,</HI> there were many wi&s;e, temperate, ju&s;t, and publick &s;pirited Per&s;ons, that would ex|po&s;e their Per&s;ons and E&s;tate &amp; Honour for the good of their Country. It was &s;aid of <HI>Sulpitius</HI> the Roman,
<Q>That one might &s;ooner &s;top the Sun in his cour&s;e, then <HI>Sulpitius</HI> in
<PB N="6" REF="001839_0010_0FB9181B5BB045A8">
his cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice.</Q>
And <HI>Ari&s;tides, Cato,</HI> and a great many others are commemorated in ancient Hi&s;tory as being vertuous, and living well according to the light that they had. And many of the <HI>Turks</HI> at this day are ju&s;t, hone&s;t and &s;ober Per&s;ons, and this partly from fear of a Deity, and to obtain His fa|vour. And Morality is a fine Ornament and Prai&s;e worthy, but the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions not|with&s;tanding, it is certain that onely tho&s;e that are in an e&s;tate of Grace do any <HI>actions that are good,</HI> and all that other Men do, e|very action that they put forth <HI>is Sinful or a Sin.</HI> And when we thus &s;ay, we would not be under&s;tood in any other but a plain &amp; fair meaning, and not as &s;peaking under the co|vert of <HI>Schola&s;tick Di&s;tinctions,</HI> &amp; various &s;en&s;es</P>
<P>And the&s;e things may be propo&s;ed in Evi|dence thereof.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the la&s;t end in unconverted Men's eye and that which is principally upon their hearts in their vertuous deportment, is <HI>them|&s;elves.</HI> It is well enough if we &s;eek our &s;elves, I know of nothing that can rea|&s;onably be objected again&s;t it, if we have &s;ome regard to our &s;elves in every thing that we do. <HI>Self love</HI> is born with us and ought always to move, (but in its own <HI>&s;phere</HI>) but &s;uch is the tran&s;cendent Excellency, the Wi&s;|dom,
<PB N="7" REF="001839_0011_0FB9181DAB521680">
Power, Truth, Mercy and Goodne&s;s, and other <HI>Perfections</HI> in the <HI>Divine Maje&s;ty,</HI> and &s;uch our dependence upon Him, and obliga|tion unto Him, that His Honour and Glory ought to be neare&s;t unto our hearts, &amp; &s;hould be principally aim'd at and de&s;igned by us in all that we do, as Men; and when any other <HI>chief End</HI> is &s;et up and advanced, the <HI>God of Glory</HI> is &s;o far <HI>Dethroned,</HI> and His Royalty in|vaded. and our doings are a vile in&s;urrection again&s;t Him. Yea, let His e&s;&s;ential Glory be con&s;idered ab&s;tractedly from the dependence that we have upon Him, and the infinite Ob|ligation that He has laid us under by Redeem|ing us, and this Honour of our thus &s;eeking His Glory either vertually or intentionally in all that we do, is His indefeazable right and prerogative; and &s;o far and &s;o much as we &s;eek our &s;elves ultimately, we ungod Him, (as far as we are capable thereof) and make War upon him. Now that we &s;ay is this, That the <HI>La&s;t End</HI> of &s;uch as are not in an E&s;tate of Grace, <HI>is &s;elf</HI>: Not but that they may have, and many of them have a regard to Gods Ho|nour, and imagine that the Lords intere&s;ts are uppermo&s;t in their de&s;ign, <HI>Joh</HI> 16.2. But &s;uch imaginations are the fruit of &s;elf flattery; and there never was an Unbeliever in the World, that de&s;igned God's Honour principally,
<PB N="8" REF="001839_0012_0FB91821C4960E98">
or as his La&s;t End in any Service that he did for Him, or act of Obedience that he put forth.</P>
<P>And this may be made out two ways.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) They may be Convinced hereof, by an impartial Examining their own hearts, and Con&s;ulting their own Experiences. Such of them as carry on a Form of Godline&s;s, and do much in Religion, will, if they enter upon this Scrutiny and Search, find, that they have really and truly an Eye unto the Lords Inter|e&s;ts and Honour: So had tho&s;e Jews of whom the Apo&s;tle bears record: <HI>Rom</HI> 10.2. That, <HI>They had a zeal of God.</HI> And &s;o might tho&s;e, in the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, Chap</HI> 66. <HI>v</HI> 5. that &s;aid, when they Excommunicated their Godly Brethren, <HI>Let the Lord be glorified</HI>: but it is one thing to &s;eek Gods Honour to &s;erve an End, a <HI>Self-End,</HI> to quiet a Mans Con&s;cience, to obtain Outward Ble&s;&s;ings, Gods Favour, or that a Man may obtain Eternal Life, and another thing to &s;eek <HI>God's Honour</HI> from a <HI>Sincere Love to Him,</HI> becau&s;e He hath Saved him from Eternal Death; and the adorable Excellency of his Nature di&s;played and di&s;|covered in the Scriptures and in His Works: it is the former only, and not the latter, that Unbelievers attain unto; and this they will
<PB N="9" REF="001839_0013_0FB9182305791F80">
find, if they impartially Examine and Search, what the Motives are that they act upon, and what they de&s;ign in their being Religious and Obedient. And here-unto corre&s;pond the Experiences of tho&s;e that believe, they know, at lea&s;t, &s;uch of them as are wi&s;e, that while they were in their Unbelief, this was the highe&s;t they did or could attain unto.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That which gives power and ability here-unto, <HI>is a &s;ound belief of the declarations and reports in the Go&s;pel concerning the Wi&s;dom, Power, Ju&s;tice, and e&s;pecially the Mercy, Grace and Faith|fulne&s;s of God di&s;played in the My&s;tery of our Salva|tion.</HI> By our woful <HI>Apo&s;tacy</HI> we have lo&s;t the knowledge of Him; and becau&s;e of the Judg|ments, that the World is and has in all Ages been full of, and our de&s;perate guiltine&s;s in His &s;ight, and that inaptitude that is upon us, and the like, to be concerned with Divine Things; we either decline concernment with Him, and give up our &s;elves to the making our &s;elves as happy as we can, in the enjoyment of the Creature, as the P&s;almi&s;t hints: P&s;al. 4.6. <HI>There be many that &s;ay, Who will &s;hew us any good. i. e</HI> Seeking it in this and the other, and a great variety of Creatures. And we read to the &s;ame effect, <HI>Rom</HI> 6.3, 4, 5, 6. Or, if this doth not happen unto us, but we are rai&s;ed up into, and act in a &s;omewhat higher
<PB N="10" REF="001839_0014_0FB918257A0CB7C0">
Orb, and more Manly Sphere, and tran&s;act with our Maker about His and our own af|fairs, through any Conceptions, Apprehen|&s;ions, Illuminations or Ideas concerning Him, that we may by any means attain unto, that fall &s;hort of that knowledge of Him that we are &s;peaking of, we are not broken off there|by from our natural channel &amp; path of &s;eek|ing our &s;elves ultimately, but go on therein, until the Lord bringeth us in &s;uch ways, as it plea&s;eth Him, more or le&s;s gradually, to <HI>be|lieve the Go&s;pel.</HI> And this is that, and that on|ly that gives power, to a loving of Him above the Creature, and to be holy. This may be &s;een by, Act. 26.18. <HI>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;s unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God</HI> Our eyes mu&s;t be opened, to <HI>behold the Glory of God in the Go&s;pel,</HI> before we can live holily. See al&s;o, 1 Joh. 4.19. <HI>We love Him becau&s;e He fir&s;t loved us</HI> And porportionably to our belief and under|&s;tanding of &s;uch things as the&s;e, will be our Holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all our Works are Dead Works and Sinful, until we are brought into an e&s;tate of Salvation, is plentifully taught in the <HI>Scripture.</HI> The <HI>Texts</HI> that are alledged by <HI>Divines</HI> as &s;peak|ing to this effect, are almo&s;t innumerable. Two or Three only &s;hall be quoted and they
<PB N="11" REF="001839_0015_0FB918269AEE8BE8">
are tho&s;e, Prov. 21.4. <HI>An high look, &amp; a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked is Sin</HI> Rom. 8.7. <HI>Becau&s;e the carnal mind is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be</HI> Gal. 3.22. <HI>But the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin</HI></P>
<P>And the &s;ame might be made out by ma|ny other Arguments.</P>
<P>And this is a thing that Men are general|ly (I &s;uppo&s;e) convinced of in one way or another, before they believe unto Salvation. And becau&s;e of our pertinacious and ob&s;tinate adhering unto and <HI>depending on our own righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which we are not ea&s;ily brought off from, without a Conviction hereof; it is need|ful that the <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel</HI> indeavour to convince their Hearers, that all Unbelievers are verily the Servants of Sin, after the Exam|ple of &s;undry of the Divinely in&s;pired Tea|chers upon Sacred Record. And it is worth our &s;erious con&s;ideration, whether neglects hereof and unskilfulne&s;s herein, be not one great cau&s;e and rea&s;on that Chri&s;tianity flou|ri&s;heth no more in the World.</P>
<P>The &s;econd thing that we offer to E&s;tab|li&s;h in believing, that our Salvation is of Meer Grace is, That <HI>all our Outward Ble&s;&s;ings are freely be&s;towed upon us</HI>&punc; Are we Fed and Cloath'd? It is of the Lord's Mercy we are &s;o. Are we pre&s;erved out of the hands of <HI>Sa|tan,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001839_0016_0FB918281A0FD830">
and are Wicked Men kept back from be|ing thus &amp; &s;o injurious unto us? We mu&s;t a&s;|cribe it unto the Grace of God. Are we re|covered from Sickne&s;s? It is becau&s;e the Lord is Gracious. Are our Lives pre&s;erved when our Acquaintance, Friends &amp; Kindred are cut off by the Sword, Di&s;ea&s;es or fatal Accidents? It is becau&s;e <HI>the Lord is Gracious to whom He will be Gracious.</HI> All the outward and common Mercies that are dealt out unto us, of what kind, denomination or &s;ort &s;oever they are, flow down unto us, from the inex|hau&s;tible Fountain of the Grace and Mercy of God. And this is true not only with re&s;|pect to Mankind, in general, but al&s;o of &s;uch of the Children of God as are mo&s;t Loyal, Dutiful and Obedient unto Him. His giv|ing <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> favour, in the eyes of the Keeper of the Pri&s;on, is a&s;cribed to His Mercy, <HI>Gen</HI> 29.21. And His recovering <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> from his dangerous Sickne&s;s is attributed unto the &s;ame cau&s;e; Phil. 2.27. <HI>And indeed he was Sick nigh unto Death, but God had mercy on him</HI> And the Truth is, the more holy any Man is the more thankful is he for, and the more does he admire the Grace of God, in be&s;tow|ing common, and more ordinary Ble&s;&s;ings upon him.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="13" REF="001839_0017_0FB9182C5EA42590">3. <HI>Chri&s;t's working out the Means of our Sal|vation, is an act of Grace</HI> He has born the penalty that was due for our Sins. This is &s;poken of under a great variety of Phra&s;es, and Expre&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Scripture.</HI> It is called a bearing of our Sins in His Body on the Tree. 1 Pet. 2.24. <HI>Who his own &s;elf bear our Sins in his Body on the Tree.</HI> And it is called therein a dying for our Sins. 1 Cor. 15.2. <HI>How that Chri&s;t dyed for our Sins.</HI> And this is implyed when He is &s;aid, to have <HI>Offered him&s;elf a Sa|crifice to God for us,</HI> Eph. 5.2. And we are taught the &s;ame Truth, when He is called, <HI>The Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sins of the World.</HI> And this was fore&s;hewn by the Multiplied <HI>Sacrifices</HI> under the Law. And as He has undergone the Penalty that was due and belonged to us for our Sins; &s;o al&s;o He has Obeyed the Law, and wrought out Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s for us, <HI>Math</HI> 3.19. <HI>Rom</HI> 5.19. Both the&s;e things were nece&s;&s;ary that &s;o we might be Saved. It was not only &s;uitable &amp; conde|cent, that if Man rebell'd and ca&s;t unparalled di&s;honour upon the Soveraign Lord of all things, that he &s;hould be ca&s;t out of his Fa|vour, and not be admitted into it again, and inherit life, unle&s;s his Honour were repaired by the offender, or his Surety underwent a puni&s;hment, that would bring as much ho|nour

<P N="5">5. <HI>Our Per&s;everance in Faith and Holine&s;s,</HI> is al&s;o from the Meer Grace &amp; Mercy of God. This will appear from the&s;e two things laid together,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It cannot be imputed unto our &s;trength, power, and ability or any creature helps. We watch again&s;t Temptation indeed, and the means that we make u&s;e of, namely <HI>Prayer, Self-Examination, Meditation, Hearing the Word Preached, Bapti&s;m,</HI> the <HI>Lords-Supper, Fa&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Thank&s;givings,</HI> and the like, have a direct and natural tendency to further and help us in well doing; but means, helps and our power to u&s;e them are of God, and if infinite Power and Wi&s;dom be not in us and them, &s;uppor|ting and managing of both, our Faith and Well-doing will quickly be at an end. Let never &s;o wi&s;e <HI>States-men</HI> &s;it at Helm in a King|dom or Province, unle&s;s the Divine Pre&s;ence be in and with them, conducting and ruling them, and the Governments over which they pre&s;ide, all things will run to ruine, and the ends of Government will not be obtained. And &s;o if the mo&s;t <HI>Skilful Phy&s;icians</HI> and pro|per Medicines are in a place, if they and the

People, Air and Sea&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c</HI> be not under a Gracious and Powerful and All-wi&s;e Di&s;po|&s;ing, Di&s;ea&s;es will break out, that will carry away both them and the People among&s;t whom they are, as a Flood. And thus it is in the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration, whatever our &s;trength may be, and however proper, and &s;uitable the means are that we enjoy for the Promotion of our <HI>Per&s;everance,</HI> our Religion will vani&s;h and come to nothing, if the Lords Gracious Pre&s;ence and Powerful and All-wi&s;e Conduct be denyed. Upon the whole then, the Gracious and Indwelling Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> is the Principal Efficient cau&s;e of our Per&s;everance. This is attributed unto Him, Col. 1.8. <HI>Who al&s;o declared unto us your love in the Spirit</HI> It was the Spirit of God that perpetuated their Love and other Graces. 2 The&s;. 2.13. <HI>Becau&s;e God hath from the begin|ning, cho&s;en us unto Salvation, through Sanctifica|tion of the Spirit.</HI> Their initial and progre&s;&s;ive Sanctification was by the SPIRIT, as the Au|thor and Efficient cau&s;e thereof. Which things are not &s;o to be under&s;tood as if by the light and ta&s;tes given unto Men in Conver|&s;ion, they are not, after a &s;ort, indi&s;&s;olubly fa&s;tened unto Divine Objects, nor as if the Efficiency and Operation of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> to promote our Per&s;everance, were ordinarily

miraculous and beyond the Sphere of His acting to produce other effects and events in their &s;everal kinds, that are wrought by Him.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) It mu&s;t be added, that the Lords cau|&s;ing us to Per&s;evere is a Gratuitous and Gra|cious Part in Him. 1 The&s;. 5.23. <HI>And I pray, your whole Spirit, Soul &amp; Body be pre&s;erved blame|le&s;s, unto the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> And it has been the way of the Godly in all Ages to go unto the Lord, as unworthy Suppliants for help in this re&s;pect. How often does <HI>Da|vid</HI> in the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> implore His Mercy in this regard. I &s;hall quote only one <HI>Text,</HI> where|in he Prays for this Mercy, as mo&s;t unwor|thy of it. And that is, P&s;al. 139.23, 24. <HI>Search me, O God, and know my heart, and try me and know my thoughts, and &s;ee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everla&s;ting.</HI> And let it be con&s;idered, how that notwith|&s;tanding the Glory of His Perfections, the right that He has unto their Service upon the account of the Relation that they have unto Him, as Creatures, His taking them into an e&s;tate of Grace, the endearing Obligations He lays them under in the cour&s;e of His Pro|vidence, their Love to Him is &s;o very &s;mall and imperceptible, their Humility and Evan|gelical Submi&s;&s;ion &s;o defective, and in general their Conver&s;ation and Deportment towards

But let a Man well believe the Love of God to us, and the adorable and a&s;toni&s;hing actings thereof for us, pa&s;t and to come, and this will unhinge him from his natural bottom, and melt down his frozen and &s;tupid heart into a loving of Him above him&s;elf, and humble thankfulne&s;s unto Him, and make him cry out with <HI>David, Truly I am thy Ser|vant, I am thy Servant</HI>: and the greater our acquaintance is to the&s;e things, the more do we love Him and are enlarged in the way of His Commandments, and therefore it was that the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in their day, &s;o Preach|ed up, and dilated and in&s;i&s;ted upon the Love, Grace and Kindne&s;s of God in their Writings and Di&s;cour&s;es, and Sermons unto the People.
