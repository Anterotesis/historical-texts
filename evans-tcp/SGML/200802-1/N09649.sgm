<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>AS it is not doubted the numerous friends of the late Reverend Mr. GEORGE WHITEFIELD will be glad of an opportunity of &s;eeing a ge|nuine copy of his la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament; his Exe|cutors have favoured the Public with a copy of the &s;ame, tran&s;mitted to them from the Orphan Hou&s;e in Geor|gia, and which they have proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. And as it was Mr. WHITE|FIELD's con&s;tant declaration he never meant to rai&s;e either a Pur&s;e or a Party, it is to be remarked, that al|mo&s;t the whole money he died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, came to him within two or three Years of his death, in the following manner, viz. Mrs. Thomp&s;on, of Tower|hill, bequeathed him 500l. By the death of his Wife, including a Bond of 300l. he got 700l. Mr. Whit|more bequeathed him 100l. and Mr. Winder 100l. and it is highly probable, that had he lived to reach Georgia from his late nothern tour, he would have much le&s;&s;ened the above &s;ums, by di&s;po&s;ing of them in the &s;ame noble and di&s;intere&s;ted manner that all the publick or private &s;ums he has been intru&s;ted with have been.</P>
