<Q><HI>&mdash;And the city of</HI> Shu&s;han <HI>rejoiced and was glad.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT we may rightly under&s;tand the occa&s;ion of the joy and gladne&s;s ex|pre&s;&s;ed in our text, it mu&s;t be noticed, that a certain favorite mini&s;ter with the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> called <HI>Haman</HI> the <HI>Agagite,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> enemy, who, it &s;eems, by his being thus called the <HI>Agagite</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> enemy, was a reputed branch of the royal feed of <HI>Amalek.</HI> This favorite, by art and ba&s;e in|&s;inuation, impo&s;ed upon his ma&s;ter, King <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> to &s;uch a degree, that he obtained a mo&s;t cruel de|cree, to take away the lives and properties of the <HI>Jews</HI> in one day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A warning to Princes, not to tru&s;t their favorites too far.</HI></NOTE> The reque&s;t and decree are as followeth: <HI>If it plea&s;e the King, let it be written that they may be de&s;troyed.&mdash;And the letters were &s;ent by po&s;ts into all the King's provinces, to de&s;troy, to kill,
<PB N="4" REF="010612_0004_0F80EEC158B9B258">
and to cau&s;e to peri&s;h all</HI> Jews, <HI>both young and old, little children and women, in one day&mdash;and to take the &s;poil of them for a prey.</HI> Now when this bloody <HI>edict</HI> was publi&s;hed, there was (as well there might be) great di&s;tre&s;s among the <HI>Jews. In every province whither&s;oever the King's commandment, and his decree came, there was great, mourning among them, and fa&s;ting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes.</HI> In this critical hour, Queen <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> informed by her uncle <HI>Mordecai,</HI> of her own and nation's danger, (although uncalled) to the ha|zard of her life, &s;he approaches the pre&s;ence of the King <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> and finds favor in his &s;ight. Thus the finger of GOD began to appear, in an&s;wer to the cries of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Jews,</HI> which &s;hone &s;till more by the &s;ignal bringing of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s long neglected &s;ervice to the mind and notice of <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> in the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable hour, to pave the way for the di&s;|grace and de&s;truction of proud <HI>Haman,</HI> and &s;ure advancement of worthy <HI>Mordecai,</HI> to dignity and honor. The&s;e things being done, at Queen <HI>E&s;ther</HI>'s &s;econd approach and reque&s;t, for her&s;elf and her people, before the King, the <HI>Jews</HI> obtain liberty to defend their lives and properties. This was the &s;ingular occa&s;ion that gave ri&s;e to the joy and glad|ne&s;s of the city of <HI>Shu&s;han,</HI> the royal palace of the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in our text.</P>
<P>LIKE to this, is the deliverance of <HI>America</HI> at this time, by the REPEAL of the <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> in &s;everal regards.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE lives, liberties and properties of the <HI>Jews</HI> were expo&s;ed to de&s;truction&mdash;And &s;o were the lives, liberties, and properties of the <HI>Americans,</HI> if this dreadful act, or decree, had not been repealed.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT bloody <HI>decree</HI> given at <HI>Shu&s;han</HI> the pa|lace, was obtained by a favorite&mdash;So 'tis thought that this odious act was procured by a favorite.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="5" REF="010612_0005_0F80EEC20AC22298">
3. THERE was mourning and fa&s;ting with the <HI>Jews,</HI> in their di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;So there has al&s;o been with many &s;ober per&s;ons in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IT was mo&s;t evident, that GOD gave the <HI>Jews</HI> deliverance&mdash;In like manner it is evident, that GOD has given us our great deliverance, who turns all hearts, even as the <HI>King's, whither &s;oever</HI> HE <HI>will.</HI></P>
<P>THUS by accommodating our text to our pre&s;ent times, we &s;hall,

<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Mention &s;ome things, that &s;hould excite us in <HI>America</HI> to joy and gladne&s;s, at this &s;ea&s;on: not confining our di&s;cour&s;e merely to our late <HI>deliverances.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we have pre&s;ented in one view, heathen <HI>Shu&s;han</HI> half buried in &s;lavery; flowing with joy and gladne&s;s, to find the doomed <HI>Jews,</HI> by the unhappy <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> con&s;titution, only indulged and encouraged to arm them&s;elves for the defence of their lives and properties. And &s;hall not <HI>we</HI> chri&s;tians and <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> feel an ardent flame of joy and gladne&s;s in&s;pire our hearts, when we &s;ee the <HI>fetters</HI> removed from our feet, and <HI>&s;words</HI> from our throats; and every thing dear to us, &s;ecured on its former ba&s;is, by the <HI>repeal</HI> of the odious Stamp-Act? Thus to behold <HI>America,</HI> emerging from this dark cloud, that threatened to pour forth upon her an irre&s;i&s;table torrent of mi&s;eries, to the late&s;t ages, is a view that mo&s;t naturally does, and &s;hould fill every true-born <HI>American,</HI> with joy and gladne&s;s, whil&s;t he di&s;cerns <HI>the &s;nare broken, and his &s;oul e&s;caped.</HI> As no language can paint out what
<PB N="6" REF="010612_0006_0F80EEC426F8CE80">
true &s;ons of <HI>America</HI> felt, and what they expected, in this night of tribulation, when their Sun of Liberty underwent &s;uch an amazing eclip&s;e; &s;o is it im|po&s;&s;ible, by words, to de&s;cribe the joy and gladne&s;s that does, on this occa&s;ion, dilate the &s;ouls of this people; reaching the mo&s;t remote corners, and with a &s;trange rapidity &s;eize every rank of rea&s;onable beings, that either de&s;ire or ta&s;te freedom.</P>
<P>AGAIN;&mdash;when we of this congregation remember the gloomy horror which covered our faces, and the angui&s;h that filled our hearts, in the year pa&s;t, under our then approaching dangers; and call to mind, that tho&s;e &s;urrounding walls bear witne&s;s for us, that there we &s;ought the LORD in our di&s;tre&s;s, and lifted up our hands, with our hearts to GOD in the heavens for deliverance, as knowing that GOD ruleth among the inhabitants of the earth, as well as armies in heaven; this reflection cannot fail of &s;welling the tide of joy and gladne&s;s in our hearts, when now we behold our&s;elves here a&s;&s;embled to prai&s;e GOD, and rejoice before him with thank&s;giving, for the very deliverance we &s;ought at his hand. And this na|turally leads us to &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>I will prai&s;e thee, for thou ha&s;t heard me, and art become my &s;al|vation.</HI> And with <HI>Solomon, He &s;hall not much re|member the days of his life; becau&s;e</HI> GOD <HI>an&s;wereth him in the joy of his heart.</HI> This &s;pring of joy &s;hould not be ea&s;ily forgotten.</P>
<P>A FARTHER con&s;ideration to excite and increa&s;e our joy and thankfulne&s;s to GOD, at this &s;ea&s;on, ari&s;es from his kind care, as the great Governor in Providence, and bountiful Author of every ble&s;&s;ing, who fore&s;aw all the mi&s;eries and embarra&s;&s;ments of poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>America;</HI> under the decay and &s;top of her commerce, &s;hutting up of the courts of ju&s;tice, with a train of other evils, which &s;trangely &s;tagnated all bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010612_0007_0F80EEC4E79D6B20">
IN this period, GOD has &s;hewed his pity and mercy, in giving &s;o general health, and &s;uch a plenty of the nece&s;&s;ary fruits of the earth, by which, in the year pa&s;t, our mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;&s;es have been much abated, and without which, in our other cir|cum&s;tances, we had nigh been overwhelmed with mi&s;ery. The&s;e are the tender mercies of our GOD, that call for joy and gratitude from every heart among us.</P>
<P>STILL to aid our joy and gladne&s;s, at this &s;ea&s;on, we recollect, that this is the happy day, in which the <HI>liberty,</HI> allowed by <HI>royal charter,</HI> of electing the mem|bers of his Maje&s;ty's council for this province, is to be exerci&s;ed. This demon&s;trates, that we yet are a free people, and have occa&s;ion to rejoice in that privilege mentioned by the prophet&mdash;<HI>Their nobles &s;hall be of them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to crown all our joy and gladne&s;s on this oc|ca&s;ion, and excite it to the highe&s;t pitch, we mu&s;t ever remember, that in the name of the divine Saviour, there is publi&s;hed to the world, a <HI>REPEAL</HI> of the mo&s;t amazing doom pronounced again&s;t &s;inners. This is indeed worthy to be called <HI>glorious news,</HI> and the mo&s;t &s;weet and heart-refre&s;hing, that ever entertained mortal ears. Lo! &s;uch me&s;&s;ages echo from the Book of GOD, <HI>Thou &s;halt call his name</HI> JESUS; <HI>for he &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins. And behold the Lamb of</HI> GOD, <HI>which taketh away the &s;ins of the world.</HI> Still the &s;oft &s;ound attracts our ears, GOD <HI>&s;ent forth his &s;on, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law, that we might receive the adoption of &s;ons.</HI> And CHRIST <HI>hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us. And the Angel &s;aid unto them, Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people: for unto
<PB N="8" REF="010612_0008_0F80EEC50E3E06D0">
you is born this day, in the city of</HI> David, <HI>a Saviour, which is</HI> CHRIST <HI>the</HI> LORD. The&s;e are me&s;&s;ages worthy of a &s;eraph &s;ent from GOD! For what will it avail us, my brethren, to rejoice in the <HI>birth-rights</HI> of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and account our&s;elves happy in a de|liverance from a late grievous <HI>burden,</HI> laid on our necks; whil&s;t in the next or pre&s;ent moment, we reflect and view our&s;elves, &s;ervants to &s;in, bond &s;laves to Satan, lying under the infinite burden of GOD'S wrath and cur&s;e, and heavy yoke of a condemning law, ha&s;ting into the pri&s;on of hell, and dark abodes of the damned, there to be re&s;erved in <HI>chains of ever|la&s;ting darkne&s;s, to the judgment of the great day.</HI> Hence, the news of an eternal redemption by JESUS CHRIST, &s;ounding in the ears of fallen men, ap|pears to be, indeed, the mo&s;t noble and highe&s;t matter of joy and gladne&s;s, not only to <HI>America,</HI> but to the world; and infinitely exceeds all tempo|ral deliverances or civil freedoms. 'Tis the &s;aying of the Redeemer of men, <HI>If the Son therefore &s;hall make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed.</HI> Let us then, in&s;pired with the hopes and lively expectations of living and reigning with CHRIST, and enjoying <HI>the glorious liberties of the &s;ons of</HI> GOD, indulge an holy freedom of &s;oul, pouring forth our joy and gladne&s;s, in a &s;ort joining the heavenly high, &s;aying, <HI>Glory to</HI> GOD <HI>in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good-will towards men</HI>&mdash;Longing for our arrival to tho&s;e peaceful abodes, where no bounds will confine, nor &s;orrows dimini&s;h our joy and gladne&s;s, in perfect freedom, for ever and ever. But to proceed:</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We were to point out, how we &s;hould rejoice and be glad, on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is GOD, (<HI>who created all things, and upholds all things, by the word of his power,</HI> who alone is the &s;upreme Governor of the world, and fountain of
<PB N="9" REF="010612_0009_0F80EEC5CD42BAC8">
being and perfection) in whom all intelligent crea|tures &s;hould rejoice and be glad, and not in them|&s;elves. It is indi&s;putable, that the joy and gladne&s;s of holy angels, is peculiarly in GOD, as the force of all perfection and glory; and is excited by every di&s;covery of the&s;e divine perfections and glories, in his works of creation, grace or providence, towards the univer&s;e of beings. It is therefore in GOD, through JESUS CHRIST, the divine <HI>mediator,</HI> that we, fallen men, &s;hould rejoice and be glad, &s;eeing 'tis only in him we are able to behold the divine glory, agreeable to that of the apo&s;tle, <HI>For</HI> GOD <HI>who com|manded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of</HI> GOD, <HI>in the face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. Hence we learn from in&s;piration, to rejoice in GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST &s;upremely. And thus &s;peaketh the prophet, <HI>I will greatly rejoice in the</HI> LORD, <HI>my &s;oul &s;hall be joyful in my</HI> GOD, <HI>for he hath clothed me with the garments of &s;alvation.</HI> Again, another prophet, in a dark &s;ea&s;on, &s;aith, <HI>Yet I will rejoice in the</HI> LORD, <HI>and joy in the</HI> GOD <HI>of my &s;al|vation.</HI> In like part <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaketh, <HI>But we al&s;o joy in</HI> GOD, <HI>through our</HI> Lord JESUS CHRIST. It behoves us, on this occa&s;ion, therefore, to rejoice in GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST, by whom every deliverance or mercy flows down to us; <HI>for &s;alvation is of the</HI> LORD. Whenever mercy, good|ne&s;s or kindne&s;s appears, there we &s;hould notice the finger of GOD, which ju&s;tly leads us this day to rejoice in GOD &s;upremely, as the alone giver of <HI>every good and perfect gift.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN:&mdash;If we would know how to rejoice with gladne&s;s acceptable before GOD, at this &s;ea&s;on, it mu&s;t &s;pring from a divine faith, wrought in our hearts by the grace of GOD, which <HI>is the &s;ub&s;tance of
<PB N="10" REF="010612_0010_0F80EEC6F1D84100">
things hoped for, the evidence of things not &s;een,</HI> and agrees to that divine &s;entence, <HI>Believing, ye rejoice with joy un&s;peakable, and full of glory.</HI> Without the divine faith in the being, perfections and faithfulne&s;s of GOD, in the record he has given of his Son, all our joy and gladne&s;s is heatheni&s;h and abominable, as an empty noi&s;e di&s;plea&s;ing before GOD; for <HI>without faith, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e</HI> HIM. Let us then <HI>take heed, brethren, left there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living</HI> GOD, in this the day of our joy and gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till to point out, how we &s;hould rejoice this day before GOD, we ought to keep in mind, how variable human &s;cenes are, not imagining that our mountain &s;tands &s;o &s;trong as never to be moved. Surely we have not &s;o &s;oon forgot the dark day, when the Sun of our <HI>Liberty</HI> &s;et in a gloomy cloud, which, for a &s;ea&s;on, boded perpetual night. Then our faces gathered palene&s;s, whil&s;t we &s;aw <HI>fair Liberty</HI> &s;o &s;uddenly fled from her former delightful abodes.</P>
<P>THIS unexpected <HI>eclip&s;e</HI> of our darling Sun of Liberty, &s;hould for ever impre&s;s our hearts with a feeling &s;en&s;e, that all human things are uncertain. Here we may learn, to &s;alute and embrace fair Liberty in her return, with a trembling hand, and jealous heart, left we provoke her to withdraw from the&s;e happy climes; for &s;he is &s;o delicate and mode&s;t, as not to fit long in the proud <HI>lap of pre&s;umption and &s;ecurity.</HI> Therefore we &s;hould at this &s;ea&s;on, accept that word of in&s;piration, <HI>Serve the</HI> LORD <HI>with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</HI> And in the mid&s;t of our joy and gladne&s;s, imitate <HI>Jacob,</HI> in his return from exile; <HI>I am not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant.</HI> In this humble, zealous and trembling manner, in|terwoven
<PB N="11" REF="010612_0011_0F80EEC75196B750">
with joy and gladne&s;s, may we now wel|come Liberty in her au&s;picious return to the&s;e her plea&s;ant &s;eats; and in &s;uch arms may we retain her to the late&s;t ages, as the offspring of GOD, &s;ent to ble&s;s this new world.</P>
<P>To add farther, how we &s;hould rojoice before GOD acceptably, on this occa&s;ion; it naturally occurs, that we remember the poor, and make them glad and rejoice with us, by kind portions, after the ancient cu&s;tom of GOD's people on occa&s;ions of &s;ingular joy. This will be <HI>an odour of a &s;weet &s;mell, a &s;acrifice acceptable, well plea&s;ing to</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Now that we may clo&s;e this head of directions, how we &s;hould rejoice and be glad before GOD, on this extraordinary occa&s;ion, which, on many ac|counts, far exceeds all that have gone before in <HI>Briti&s;h America;</HI> as the di&s;tre&s;s and awful appre|hen&s;ions of danger and mi&s;ery had ri&s;en, in general, much higher than ever was known in this land before, under her &s;harpe&s;t trials, and mo&s;t &s;ingular di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which have been many and great from the very beginning; &s;o never did the hearts of all &s;well with grief, or expand with joy and gladne&s;s, as on this occa&s;ion,&mdash;Therefore in the fulne&s;s of our hearts, we &s;hould pour forth devout raptures of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to GOD on high, that go|verneth over the kingdoms of men, who proclaimeth him&s;elf <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> He only <HI>is worthy to be prai&s;ed, who doth great things, un|&s;earchable and pa&s;t finding out.</HI> 'Tis the LORD our GOD who hath given <HI>us this great deliverance,</HI> in which we rejoice and are glad.&mdash;Therefore, with holy <HI>David,</HI> let our hearts and lips join, when he &s;aith, <HI>I will prai&s;e the name of</HI> GOD <HI>with a &s;ong, and will magnify</HI> HIM <HI>with thank&s;giving.</HI> In this &s;ort may our affections a&s;cend to GOD, in the chaunt of
<PB N="12" REF="010612_0012_0F80EEC817D40960">
prai&s;e this day, which <HI>&s;hall plea&s;e the</HI> LORD <HI>better than an ox or bullock, that hath horns and hoofs;</HI> yea, better than all the fire-works in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>III. We were to notice &s;ome fruits that &s;hould attend our joy and gladne&s;s, on this &s;pecial oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme love of GOD, &s;tands in the front of the&s;e fruits, which &s;hould wait on, and flow from our joy at this &s;ea&s;on. May we not ju&s;tly imagine, that GOD is &s;aying of <HI>America,</HI> on this occa&s;ion, as he did of his <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by the prophets: <HI>Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: &s;o he was their Saviour. In all their affliction, he was afflicted, and the angel of his pre&s;ence &s;aved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them.</HI> And &s;hall not &s;uch thoughts, rai&s;e in our hearts, the mo&s;t ar|dent wi&s;h for the heavenly dove, to de&s;cend with balmy wings, and &s;hed abroad in our hearts a &s;era|phick flame of love to GOD; that we may give GOD our whole hearts in this the day of our glad|ne&s;s. And &s;o &s;hall we prove that we are children that will not lie, and manife&s;t, that our hearts are right with GOD. When our &s;ouls breathe forth this language of <HI>David, I will love thee, O</HI> LORD, <HI>my &s;trength.&mdash;The</HI> LORD <HI>is my rock, and my fortre&s;s, and my deliverer.</HI> The LORD, in very deed, has been our &s;trength, rock, fortre&s;s, and deliverer in our late di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and in all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Hitherto we may &s;ay the LORD hath helped us.&mdash;And can we think of making any le&s;s return to him, than the highe&s;t affections of our &s;ouls? GOD forbid &s;uch a thought.</P>
<P>AGAIN:&mdash;The giving glory and honour to GOD, as the author of all, and particularly our late &s;al|vation, is a fruit nece&s;&s;arily connected with our joy this day. We have a divine injunction, <HI>Call</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="010612_0013_0F80EEC8ED437A88"><HI>upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me.</HI> We of this congrega|tion have the comfort to recollect, that here we called upon GOD in our day of trouble, and he hath delivered us: Let us not then be wanting in glorifying HIM. But my brethren, whil&s;t I am urging you to give glory and honour to GOD, the &s;upreme benefactor, from whom every ble&s;&s;ing de&s;cends, I abhor the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought, of dimini&s;hing our e&s;teem and veneration for our gra|cious King, and noble Patriots, whom GOD long pre&s;erve as exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ings, not only to our na|tion and land, but to the world, and late receive them to eternal glory. Yet I think too much has formerly been &s;aid, in our national &s;ucce&s;&s;es and deliverances, about mini&s;terial wi&s;dom, accompli&s;hed generals, and intrepid &s;oldiers; even to the neglect of that honour and glory, which is due to GOD only, who furni&s;hes tho&s;e brave in&s;truments with their &s;hining talents, and rai&s;es them to power, and &s;ucceeds them in their noble enterpri&s;es for the good of men&mdash;As we &s;eem to have fallen into this error formerly, we may ea&s;ily di&s;cern like danger at this time, of robbing GOD of his glory, by a&s;cribing too much to men, who are but in|&s;truments, how excellent &s;oever they may be. An in&s;pired King exhorts the grandees of the world in this language, <HI>Give unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>O ye mighty, give unto the</HI> LORD <HI>glory and &s;trength.&mdash;Give unto the</HI> LORD <HI>the glory due unto his name!</HI> To this ex|hortation may I not ardently wi&s;h, the mighty in our nation, land, and world, would do them&s;elves the honour carefully to attend. Then will they e&s;teem them&s;elves mo&s;t honoured by tho&s;e, who honour GOD for them, and account it their highe&s;t glory to be in&s;truments of glorifying HIM by whom
<PB N="14" REF="010612_0014_0F80EEC991F73288">
<HI>kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice.</HI> Thus we &s;hall be &s;afe in paying all ju&s;t honour to the in&s;truments of our deliverance, whil&s;t we glorify GOD on their behalf. This fruit of honouring GOD, I hope will attend our joy and gladne&s;s on this &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE next fruit that pre&s;ents it&s;elf in view, as what &s;hould naturally attend our joy and glad|ne&s;s, for the pre&s;ent deliverance from &s;lavery, is a &s;erving GOD with freedom and delight of &s;oul, running the way of his commands with enlarged hearts, who has delivered us from bondage and di&s;|tre&s;s. Does not GOD &s;peak to us of <HI>America</HI> in his providence, as once to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by his prophet? <HI>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love, and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws.</HI> Has not GOD done this latterly for us? And &s;hall not we e&s;teem his &s;ervice our greate&s;t freedom; accounting his <HI>yoke ea&s;y, and his burden light? Being delivered out of the hands of our ene|mies,</HI> let us <HI>&s;erve</HI> GOD <HI>without fear, in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, before him all the days of our life.</HI> For us now to live in the &s;ervice of our own lu&s;ts, and &s;lavery to Satan, or in any di&s;obedience to the ju&s;t and lawful authority over us under GOD, when we are rejoicing in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> freedom and late deliverance.&mdash;This is ab&s;urd to the la&s;t degree, and well does merit, and ju&s;tly might provoke an holy GOD, for &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s and ingratitude, to doom us to eternal <HI>chains</HI> in hell, as delighting in &s;lavery.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t fruit we &s;hall notice, that &s;hould attend our joy and gladne&s;s on this occa&s;ion, is a fitting and retaining on our &s;pirits, a deep and grateful &s;en&s;e of GOD'S, unmerited, mercy and goodne&s;s to|wards us in our deliverance, &s;o that we may not lo&s;e the influence of it on our hearts and lives all our
<PB N="15" REF="010612_0015_0F80EECAAC4E6840">
days;&mdash;left the weight of that charge fall upon us, as on <HI>I&s;rael of old&mdash;They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy</HI>&mdash;Or that rebuke, <HI>they &s;ang his prai&s;e, they &s;oon forgat his works.</HI> GOD forbid &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s and trifling, ever to be found with us. But may a grateful &s;en&s;e of our &s;alvation abide in our hearts, and influence our lives whil&s;t we remember that we are rea&s;onable beings.</P>
<P>Now we clo&s;e all with a few reflections. Here 'tis natural to view the opening &s;cenes of joy, with a kind of divine plea&s;ure expanding our hearts into an exta&s;y, like that of the p&s;almi&s;t, <HI>When the</HI> LORD <HI>turned again the captivity of</HI> Zion, <HI>we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with &s;inging: then &s;aid they, the</HI> LORD <HI>hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</HI> Thus the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing and marvelous pro&s;|pect, breaks in upon our eyes at this time; when but a few months pa&s;t, a pro&s;pect of blood and &s;lavery both to our&s;elves and po&s;terity, pre&s;ented it&s;elf in all its horrid deformity. The face of things are now changed, and the happy vi&s;ion of &s;afety and <HI>Liberty</HI> entertains our eyes, and employs our thoughts, with inexpre&s;&s;ible delight in the thoughts of living and dying free men, and leaving this freedom, as our be&s;t patrimony, to the ages yet unborn. What mu&s;t be the &s;atisfaction of &s;uch reflections, when they receive the additional &s;weetne&s;s which &s;prings from the re|demption of JESUS CHRIST, <HI>into the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of</HI> GOD! This far exceeds all language, and &s;wallows up all our thoughts as in a boundle&s;s ocean of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>ANOTHER reflection at this &s;ea&s;on, may very well turn our ca&s;e in a &s;pecial manner, to give GOD the glory of our freedom, and not man: <HI>Not unto us,
<PB N="16" REF="010612_0016_0F80EECB3A854320">
O</HI> LORD, <HI>not unto us, but unto thy name give glory.</HI> This is becoming language, even for the mo&s;t ex|alted monarchs on earth. Yet we find a &s;trange aptne&s;s in men, when admiring the noble in&s;truments of their pre&s;ervation, to rob GOD of the glory due unto his name, and wickedly &s;ay, '<HI>tis the voice of a</HI> GOD, <HI>and not of a man.</HI> Although <HI>Herod</HI>'s worms demon&s;trate the fal&s;hood of &s;uch a &s;hout, and leave a warning for the mo&s;t exalted princes, or &s;hining orators, to give GOD <HI>the glory.</HI> From this &s;in of robbing GOD of his glory, in this tran&s;port of joy that fills our land, may divine <HI>grace</HI> pre&s;erve both us and our happy deliverers under GOD.</P>
<P>TO add farther, GOD'S delivering us at this time, &s;hould in&s;pire us with holy courage and confidence, in HIM, in all our dangers, and teach the ages yet to come, to <HI>fix their hope in</HI> GOD. Shall we not &s;ay, on this occa&s;ion, GOD <HI>is our refuge and &s;trength, a very potent help in trouble: therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be car|ried into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea?</HI> Let <HI>America</HI> never de&s;pair; but tru&s;t in and cry to GOD, as her refuge and pre&s;ent help in trouble.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till our reflections &s;hould lead us to re|member, we are this day before the LORD our GOD, in our joy and gladne&s;s. Therefore our joy &s;hould be &s;uch as becometh men and chri&s;tians; not the joy of bea&s;ts and heathens&mdash;left if we clo&s;e this day with vain mirth, we &s;hould provoke the eyes of GOD'S holine&s;s to &s;end more wrath upon us, by which we may be utterly con&s;umed. Here, &s;urely, while we are &s;olacing our hearts with the plea&s;ure of deliverance, from perpetual &s;lavery to men, it becomes us to feel a kind of holy indig|nation &s;well in our brea&s;ts, at the thought of living in a mo&s;t abject &s;lavery to our own lu&s;ts, and
<PB N="17" REF="010612_0017_0F80EECBF9F73FA8">
being the willing captives of Satan. And does it not become <HI>Americans</HI> in general, and each of us in particular, to petition, with a greater union and importunity, the <HI>Maje&s;ty of Heaven,</HI> for deli|verance from &s;uch a &s;piritual &s;lavery, than ever it did to petition his Maje&s;ty on earth, from the de|liverance from the mo&s;t dete&s;table <HI>Stamp-Act?</HI> Or can any thing le&s;s than a re&s;olution, never to be forgotten, burn in our hearts on this occa&s;ion, de|termining our &s;ouls, that by the grace of GOD, we will not je&s;t or give over the &s;uit, until we know the happine&s;s of being CHRIST's <HI>free-men?</HI> This will afford a plea&s;ure infinitely more exalted and ravi&s;hing, than what now fills <HI>America</HI> with joy and gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now let our reflections clo&s;e with an ardent wi&s;h, that <HI>America</HI> may be <HI>as a field which the</HI> LORD <HI>hath ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> on which he will cau&s;e his heavenly dew perpetually to de&s;cend, where heaven-born Liberty &s;hall for ever &s;mile&mdash;All who&s;e inhabitants, like their kindred &s;pirit on high, may be in&s;pired with &s;upreme love to GOD, and his Son JESUS CHRIST. Animated with this offspring of GOD, love divine, may uncea&s;ingly give him the honour due unto his name&mdash;Aiming at the mo&s;t univer&s;al obedi|ence, &s;hall <HI>honour all men, love the brotherhood, fear</HI> GOD, <HI>honour the King</HI>&mdash;And continually re|taining the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of GOD'S mercy and loving-kindne&s;s towards them, by which they are indulged to dwell in tents of freedom on earth; and live in &s;ure hopes (by JESUS CHRIST) of &s;hining in glorious man&s;ions of perfect freedom with GOD in heaven for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
