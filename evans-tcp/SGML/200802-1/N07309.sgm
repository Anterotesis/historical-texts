<P>_IT was the Ober&s;vation of an Ancient, who had well re|marked the Infirmity of Men, that "becua&s;e they have no Changes, therefore they fear not GOD." But however the calm, uni|form Cour&s;e of Providence may too little affect light Minds, yet a Series of &s;uch alarming Events, as we have for Years pa&s;t &s;een and felt; the divine Patronage of Right and Liberty; the many unexpected, yea Improbable and marvellous Steps, by which this noble Cau&s;e has been re&s;ened from Dan|gers, and at length amply &s;ecured; are Proofs of the &s;overeignty righteous and gracious Dominion of GOD, which &s;hould and will fix the Re&s;olution of every &s;ober Mind to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ide religiou&s;ly in Him.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009334_0006_1030329CC66D2828">At the &s;ame Time, the be&s;t Apprehen|&s;ions of GOD, which Rea&s;on aided by Re|velation can form, teach us to rely on the Father of Spirits, the great Pre&s;erver of Men, not only in Emergencies, but in the gene|ral Cour&s;e of Life, and even in Affairs wherein human Power and Sagacity have much to do, for a proper Direction of the Powers of the Mind, as well as for the Main|tenance of the Health and Strength of the Body.</P>
<P>PRAYER therefore, is an Application to Heaven, as natural and as obvious, in its Grounds and Motives, as any of the mo&s;t common Actions of Life. A Mind open to divine Advices, is a Mind in its true State of mode&s;t Humility.</P>
<P>THIS important Day then, of the annu|al Exerci&s;e of the peculiar Rights of the In|habitants of this Province, by which Rights our civil Polity approaches nearer to that of the happy I&s;land from whence we origina|ted, than that of any other of the Briti&s;h Plantations, and if &s;o, to the Standard of a perfect Government; This <HI>joyful Day,</HI> I &s;ay,

is mo&s;t properly opened, by this &s;olemn Act of public Wor&s;hip; by a devout Addre&s;s to the Fountain of Wi&s;dom, from whom are derived all the Streams of it, which are di&s;|per&s;ed in innumerable human Minds; and by a decent Attention to tho&s;e moral and religious Truths, an Attention to which, is indeed in the la&s;t Re&s;ort, the hearkening unto GOD. What lively Faith &s;hould ani|mate the&s;e Services; "O People &s;aved of the LORD, for whom he has done &s;uch great Things, whereof ye are glad."</P>
<P>FROM whence can a Politician go to the mo&s;t arduous Affairs, which require Cool|ne&s;s, Deliberation, Integrity, publick Spi|rit, and an inward Regard to GOD, better than from &s;uch an Exerci&s;e, as compo&s;es the Soul, brings to View the highe&s;t Motives to di&s;intere&s;ted Benevolence, and pre&s;ents in their true Colours, Craft, Avarice, little De&s;igns, &s;ini&s;ter Practices, and every Thing, which generous Souls and tho&s;e be&s;t ac|quainted with them&s;elves, are mo&s;t jealous of, and keep the &s;tricte&s;t Guard again&s;t.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred Story now read, which the Wi&s;dom of GOD has han|ded
<PB N="9" REF="009334_0008_1030E8A79DEEE720">
down to us, may not lead to tho&s;e im|portant Points, which have been often treated on this Anniver&s;ary, with Accuracy, yet it may &s;ugge&s;t to us &s;ome &s;uch Truths, as however obvious, yet can never pa&s;s our Minds, but with Advantage, and which have a direct A&s;pect on the weighty Affairs of this Day.</P>
<P>THE Style and Con&s;truction of the&s;e Ver|&s;es, is that of an Apologue, or Fable, a Mode of &s;peaking extremely popular in ancient Times, and much in Ta&s;te among the ea&s;tern Nations at this Day. It had its peculiar Advantages, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of Reproof; it in&s;inuated it&s;elf in a &s;mooth and artful Manner into Per&s;ons indi&s;po&s;ed to hear, and by not making per&s;onal Applica|tion on the In&s;tant, it delayed that Re|&s;entment, thro' which Reproof often fails of its U&s;e.</P>
<P>SOME Roman Writers have piqued them|&s;elves on the famous Apologue of <HI>Menenius Agrippa,</HI> concerning the Stomach and Limbs of the human Body, which had &s;uch a wonderous Influence in calming the irri|tated Spirits of the Patricians and Commons, as being the mo&s;t ancient Example of that
<PB N="10" REF="009334_0009_1030E8ABB079F538">
Manner of Speaking. It mu&s;t have morti|fied them to have known, that this moral and political Fable, correct, beautiful and in&s;tructive as it is, was uttered by a de&s;pi&s;ed and in their Opinion, barbarous Hebrew, 700 Years before <HI>Agrippa</HI> was born.</P>
<P>FOR it was delivered, while <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was yet governed by Judges of their own Elec|tion. Among the&s;e <HI>Gideon</HI> was famous. Under their grievous Oppre&s;&s;ions, GOD rai|&s;ed them up this eminent Magi&s;trate and General, who with great Succe&s;s humbled their Enemies, and re&s;tored their Liberty and Tranquility. Such a grateful Sen&s;e had the People of his Merit and Services, that they were for rendering the &s;upreme Magi&s;tracy hereditary in his Family, which he &s;aw fit to decline. But this was a tran|&s;ient Fit of Gratitude; for when their Dan|ger was no more, they treated his Family with ba&s;e Neglect. And no wonder, that when (as we find) they had forgotten their &s;upreme Deliverer, they &s;hould ill u&s;e the In|&s;truments of his Providence for their Good.</P>
<P>THIS unworthy Spirit was wro't up, by a &s;editious ba&s;e-born Son of <HI>Gideon,</HI> named <HI>Abimelech,</HI> a Youth of an ambitious and
<PB N="11" REF="009334_0010_1030E8AD46366888">
enterpri&s;ing Genius, of a cruel and tyran|nical Temper. He had the Addre&s;s to per|&s;uade a &s;trong Party to combine in &s;etting a&s;ide <HI>Gideon</HI>'s, legitimate Sons, under the Pre|tence (and Ambition never wants colour|able Pretences) that Inconveniences might ari&s;e to the Con&s;titution, from their Num|bers. And le&s;t after the People had ta&s;ted of his arbitrary Mea&s;ures, they &s;hould re|cover their Sen&s;es, he villainou&s;ly murdered all <HI>Gideon's</HI> Sons, except this <HI>Jotham,</HI> the Speaker in our Text, who e&s;caped the Ma&s;&s;acre. And thus <HI>Abimelech</HI> was made King by the prevailing Faction.</P>
<P>ADVICE of this Tran&s;action was it &s;eems bro't to <HI>Jotham,</HI> before the A&s;&s;embly of Elec|tors broke up; and he from a Place of Safety addre&s;&s;es them in the Manner I have read; intending by the "Olive Tree, &amp;c." the Family of <HI>Gideon,</HI> who had the Example and In&s;tructions of their Father, to form them to the Love of their Country, and of every &s;ocial Virtue; and by the "Bramble", their new Leader, the Spirit of who&s;e Go|vernment was ea&s;ily predicted, from the Temper and pa&s;t Conduct of the Man. Thus much for the Occa&s;ion of this Ha|rangue.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="009334_0011_1030E8AED6E6AFA8">TO bring this Fable as an Authority, to prove the divine Right of Societies of chu|&s;ing their chief Magi&s;trate, tho' a Proof as much to the Purpo&s;e as many Texts which have been adduced, to prove the divine hereditary Right of Tyranny and Tyrants, would yet be futile and ab&s;urd. What has more Weight is, that this Fragment of An|tiquity, &s;hews how high we may trace the Claim and Practice of civil Societies, to elect &s;uch to Places of Tru&s;t for the common Benefit, as would in the general Opinion well an&s;wer the Ends of their Appointment.</P>
<P>THE Doctrines of Slavery, political or theological, are not the Maxims of Rea&s;on, Prudence or Revelation; nor took Place till Men by Ignorance, Effeminacy and Cor|ruption, became fitted for them. 'Tis no doubt an Improvement upon this Principle of civil Right, in great and populous Com|munities, where the chief Authority is en|tru&s;ted to ONE, to render it hereditary in a certain Family, &s;o long as the Succe&s;&s;ion in it comitts with the well-being of the Society.</P>
<P>BUT, 'tis a le&s;s ab&s;tract U&s;e I propo&s;e to make of this Parable, by directing your Thoughts, my honoured and can did HEAR|ERS,
<PB N="13" REF="009334_0012_1030E8B54DC9ADA8">
to two or three Le&s;&s;ons and Warnings of Wi&s;dom, &s;et here to View. And if what I &s;hall now &s;ay, be the Words of moral and religious Truth and Soberne&s;s, it will not be Arrogance in me, to u&s;e <HI>Jotham's</HI> Words, "Hearken unto me, and GOD &s;hall hear|ken unto you."</P>
<P N="1">I&s;t. THE fir&s;t is, That it is the Part of Wi&s;dom, in tho&s;e who have the Right of electing others to important Tru&s;ts in Soci|ety, to choo&s;e &s;uch as have in private Life manife&s;ted, that the benevolent Affections have powerful Influence upon them, who have conducted worthily in more contract|ed Spheres of Action.</P>
<P>SUCH a Character <HI>Jotham</HI> intends, by "the Olive Tree with who&s;e Fatne&s;s they honour GOD and Man," "the Fig-tree a|bounding in Sweetne&s;s and good Fruit," "the Vine who&s;e Wine cheereth" or is a|greeable to "GOD and Man." The&s;e the Republic of Trees called forth to public Sta|tions, who had before &s;hewn their Di&s;po|&s;ition to promote the Happine&s;s of all about them, in their narrow Circle, and of whom it was to be presumed that their U&s;efulne&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="009334_0013_1030E8B883904EC8">
would be increa&s;ed, when their Capacity of Service &s;hould be extended. The Appli|cation is ea&s;y.</P>
<P>OBSERVATION of human Nature fully proves, that the Wi&s;dom of the Creator has made Part of our Frame, two Setts of Af|fections to impell us to Action, the &s;elfi&s;h and the benevolent; in the Ballance of which, the due Proportion of their Influ|ence, the perfect Character in &s;ocial Life con&s;i&s;ts. And altho' &s;uch is the Influence of Matter, in the different Combination of its Parts, upon Mind; &s;o manifold are the Trials which the &s;ame Wi&s;dom &s;ees be&s;t for different Creatures; that the&s;e Affections, the&s;e inward Motives, have very different Proportions in the Make of different Per|&s;ons; yet by the due Exerci&s;e of the Powers of the Mind they may be re&s;pec|tively cultivated or re&s;trained, &s;o as that any one by prudent Conduct in indulging or limiting them, may become entitled to Re&s;pect and Love, and promi&s;e fair to be a public Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>WHEN a &s;trong Di&s;po&s;ition to do Good and promote Happine&s;s, ari&s;es merely or
<PB N="15" REF="009334_0014_1030E8BA1743FE60">
mo&s;tly from natural Complexion, 'tis yet in a moral View amiable; &s;eeing the Pre&s;ump|tion is, that notwith&s;tanding the natural Bias, there will be much Occa&s;ion in this corrupt World, for the re&s;training the Sti|mulus of contrary Affections, in the various Parts and incidents of the Intercour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P>BUT this Character becomes more ami|able and u&s;eful, becau&s;e more perfect, when the&s;e Tendencies of Con&s;titution become fixed Habits, on Reflection and Principle. When Men are active in their Endeavours for the Welfare of tho&s;e about them, from a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the innate Excellency and happy Fruits of public Spirit, from a Com|pari&s;on of the&s;e with the contrary Temper, which cold, vindictive, proud, avaritious, cannot feel the &s;ublime Plea&s;ure of &s;ympa|thizing with others, but lives only for it&s;elf, and having been u&s;ele&s;s or noxious in its Day, drops into Oblivion unregretted, unlamen|ted, and its Memory rots.</P>
<P>BUT Religion, Contemplation of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD and his Son, the be&s;t Friend of Men, &s;tedfa&s;t Imitation of the&s;e highe&s;t and mo&s;t noble Examples; this fixes &s;ocial
<PB N="16" REF="009334_0015_1030E8BF23663D98">
Love on its firme&s;t and be&s;t Foundation; this affords the mo&s;t worthy and powerful Motives to it; this rai&s;es it to the mo&s;t exal|ted Pitch.</P>
<P>WHEN Affections of this Kind have the A&s;cendant in private Life, the Per&s;on whom they po&s;&s;e&s;s becomes a rich Bl&s;&s;ing to all within the Sphere of their Operation. Place him at the Head of a Family, he counts it the chief Joy of Life, to exert him&s;elf for its Good. His wi&s;e Maxims of Education, his prudent Regimen, derive Ble&s;&s;ings even on his remote&s;t Dependants. His Servants are as Children, his Children as his own Soul. He forms them to &s;uch Tempers, he obliges them to &s;uch Deportment, as &s;hall maintain Internal Harmony and Friend&s;hip, he encourages their Indu&s;try, trains them to Virtue and Piety and u&s;es every Method whereby they may become meet for the De&s;cent of the be&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven up|on them.</P>
<P>SUCH an One is the Life and Cement of good Neighbourhood. His "liberal Heart devi&s;eth liberal Things," and "the Law of Kindne&s;s is in his Lips." He "prays for the Peace of Jeru&s;alem," and his uncea&s;ing En|deavours
<PB N="17" REF="009334_0016_1030E8C56FB72238">
&s;econd his be&s;t Wi&s;hes. He &s;tills the angry Pa&s;&s;ions of the Imprudent, is the Arbiter of contending Parties, feels the Troubles and mourns the Folly and Vices of every Individual, rejoices in their Joys.&mdash;He is ever vigilant for the Intere&s;ts of the Church, Pari&s;h, Town, he is connected with, and never more in his Element, than when engaged in De&s;igns for their Tran|quility, Opulence, Virtue and Religion.</P>
<P>RAISE &s;uch a Character to a public Sta|tion, an important Tru&s;t in Society, that of a Maker for In&s;tance of tho&s;e Laws by which it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and this generous Spirit which before ble&s;&s;ed a few, &s;ends forth its benign Influence, and Thou&s;ands and Thou|&s;ands feel the happy Effects of it. He receives the Tru&s;t as Power put into his Hands by the univer&s;al Father, to indulge in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Degree to his ruling Pa&s;&s;ion. No Honours, no Profits of his own are &s;ought di&s;tinct from &s;uch generous Views, no De&s;igns of others countenanced, which are unfavorable to the public Peace and Pro&s;perity. He enjoys the Plenty, the Li|berty, the Knowledge, the Virtue, of all about him, in Pro&s;pect, while he is pur&s;uing proper Mea&s;ures for them; in plea&s;urable
<PB N="18" REF="009334_0017_1030E8C7071E3078">
Sympathy when they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. He is therefore ever intent, moved thereto by In&s;tinct, Rea&s;on and Religion, to im|prove his Tru&s;t to the general Advantage, from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t Point of it.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;uch is the de&s;erved Character of the ruling Part of a Community, "GOD has a Plea&s;ure for them," Men of &s;uch a Temper and &s;uch Affections, &s;leep and wake for the common Benefit. Their equal and ardent Love to the Whole, excites them to all &s;uch Mea&s;ures as Wi&s;dom points out, whereby the Whole may be made ea&s;y and happy. While by all Encouragement to Agri|culture, they "turn a Wilderne&s;s into a fruit|ful Field," they protect and cheri&s;h her Si&s;|ter Commerce, and make every Part of the Globe, as well as their own, mini&s;ter to their Plenty and Riches. Fair Liberty, which gives Life and Spirit to the whole, is guar|ded by them as the Apple of their Eye.&mdash;Wrong Doing and Immorality are frowned upon, Temperance and good Manners, &s;up|ported as the very Source of that Spirit of Independance and ma&s;culine Courage, which mu&s;t give the collective Body of a Community, Re&s;pect and Weight with their Neighbours, which will render them terri|ble
<PB N="19" REF="009334_0018_1030E8C898BD09D0">
to foreign Enemies, as "an Army with Burners." In their Days, Arts and Scie|nces will be cultivated and flouri&s;h, tho&s;e who excel in them be honoured and favour|ed, while their Labours tend to enoble the Mind, to diffu&s;e tho&s;e intellectual Accom|pli&s;hments, which afford the mo&s;t refined Plea&s;ures the human Mind can be ble&s;&s;ed with, &s;hort of tho&s;e which are divine, and at the &s;ame Time rai&s;e up from Age to Age, Men of "Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, the &s;ta|bility of their Times." E&s;pecially will this lovely Spirit of Patrioti&s;m exert it&s;elf in the Support of real Religion, by &s;everely ani|madverting on every Thing contrary to its unque&s;tioned Dictates, by &s;tricly requiring that outward Veneration of GOD, which none deny to be his due, by guarding the Rights of Con&s;cience with the nice&s;t Care, the lea&s;t Infringement of which, in &s;ome De|gree &s;aps the Foundation of that "pure Re|ligion and undefiled," which alone is u&s;e|ful to Men, or acceptable to the Deity.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it may be well inferred, that when any Community, or tho&s;e in it who have the Right of electing their principal Officers, neglect &s;uch Quali|fications as I have de&s;cribed, they become
<PB N="20" REF="009334_0019_1030E8CA2B481FB8">
in the Language of our Law, <HI>Felo's de &s;e,</HI> in the Style of Scripture, "they refu&s;e to hearken unto GOD" and "reject the Coun|sel of GOD again&s;t them&s;elves." For no|thing is more certain than that "Grapes are not to be gathered of Thorns, nor Figs of Thi&s;tles." No Society can flouri&s;h long, where public Spirit is not the Characteristics of its Rulers&mdash;Avarice will in an indepen|dent State its Neighbours, and in any State keep its own interior Condition weak and contemptible, by &s;tinting the Progre&s;s of every Thing which is its Strength and Beauty. In a &s;ingle per&s;on, it will thwart every Mea&s;ure which requires Expence, &s;tarving the Public for fear of le&s;&s;ening its own private Stock. Terrible are the Effects of this corrupt Pa&s;&s;ion, when Rulers are ve|nal, and Ju&s;tice it&s;elf bought and &s;old.&mdash;Want of Capacity, from whence proceed little &s;ordid Views, will &s;erve particular Inte|rests to the Detriment of the common, cre|ate Unea&s;ine&s;s and Bickerings, like tho&s;e of the Belly and Limbs in the Fable, and keep a Society low.&mdash;Ambition, except well re|strained, is dangerous in a Ruler: When gratified, it cannot heartily love Equals, is apt to look with an evil Eye on Liberty her|&s;elf, when the cro&s;&s;es its Views; di&s;appoint|ed

e&s;pecially in an ira&s;cible Con&s;titution, which is mo&s;tly the Ca&s;e, it is like a raging Fire which devours every Thing in its way, nor &s;pares "the Cedars of Lebanon."&mdash;In|dolence, will not give it&s;elf the Trouble to fore&s;ee or guard; to think nor act for "the Peace of Jeru&s;alem." The worst impending Calamities awake it not. The Public &s;inks or &s;wims as Events turn up, when unactive Men are at Helm.&mdash;What is called a politi|cal Head, &s;kill in the Art of Government, where di&s;intere&s;ted Patrioti&s;m is not at Bot|tom, is but a mean dete&s;table Craft, which abu&s;es its Acquaintance with the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, its A&s;cendency over their Ignorance, or Confidence it has in&s;idiou&s;ly gained, to an&s;wer Purpo&s;es alien from the general Inte|re&s;t, by Means incon&s;i&s;tent with plain open Right.&mdash;Severity of Temper, inclining to write its Laws in Blood, will keep Society unquiet, and be apt to approach the Verge of Tyranny.

<P>WHEREFORE, Let tho&s;e of my Hearers who are more peculiarly concerned in the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, hearken unto GOD. They have been in a &s;olemn Manner a&s;king his Direction and Ble&s;&s;ing this Morning; GOD &s;peaks to them, he an&s;wers their Reque&s;ts, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Dictates of good Sen&s;e, Integrity and Prudence, which we pre&s;ume are now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> them, and which if attended to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> an happy I&s;&s;ue to the Choice of this Day.

repo&s;ed in him, than this, That he has giv|en full Proof in private Life, of the Extent and Strength of the Habits of Ju&s;tice and Benevolence he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. When the&s;e Ha|bits are joined with good Sen&s;e, exten&s;ive Knowledge and Penetration; which I mean always to take into the Account, and anima|ted by a Reverence of GOD, and they fix on &s;uch Men, they have done their Part faith|fully, and may chearfully leave Events to GOD.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Second</HI> Ob&s;ervation I make on the Part of antient Story now read, is, That Men who are well qualified for important Offices in Society, will, when called to undertake them, do it with a &s;erious Sen&s;e of the Labour and Difficulty, attending a faithful Di&s;charge of them.</P>
<P>THIS Remark I make, on the Aver&s;ene&s;s of the Olive-Tree, the Fig-Tree, &amp;c. to the being preferred; their e&s;teeming the Ea&s;e and Quiet of a retired Life of Beneficence, more eligible than all the Honours and Pro|fits of a public Station.</P>
<P>GOD forbid that all worthy Men &s;hould carry a similar Aver&s;ion to &s;uch a Length,
<PB N="24" REF="009334_0023_1030E8DA48910610">
that Society &s;hould be forced to recur to Brambles, for the filling the Departments ne|ce&s;&s;ary to its Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>WHERE Men in high Po&s;ts, execute the Duties of them with Integrity and Zeal, the Envious, or tho&s;e who affect to degrade hu|man Nature, to derive whatever appears va|luable from a foul and corrupt Source, the&s;e may call &s;uch, Men of Ambition, and &s;ay, they are but gratifying their Pride; but the Tenor of their Conduct proves the Goodne&s;s of their Principles. Let Ambition be one; and is it not (within due Limits) a good one, yea a nece&s;&s;ary one, for Creatures of our Rank, who are not &s;o perfect as to be mo|ved only by the &s;ublime&s;t Affections. Public Tru&s;ts well di&s;charged, uniform Patrioti&s;m, vindicate from &s;uch invidious A&s;per&s;ions prove the &s;elfish Pa&s;&s;ions to be under due Re|straint: For where &s;uch Conduct is per&s;e|vered in, there mu&s;t have been a &s;ober Sen&s;e of the Weight of &s;uch Tru&s;ts, a final Resolu|tion to go through every Step of Labour, needful to the qualifying for the faithful and u&s;eful Di&s;charge of them.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="009334_0024_1030E8E12CFEB8F8">LET us then &s;uppo&s;e, an upright Mind deliberating on and ballancing each Side of the Affair, when a chief Place in Govern|ment pre&s;ents. He &s;ees before him Honour and Di&s;tinction among his Fellow-Citizens; Power which Nature &s;o greedily catches at; perhaps more Revenue than private Life will afford him. But he &s;ees on the other Side, that good Con&s;cience requires, clo&s;e Application of Mind to the ama&s;&s;ing civil and political Knowledge; the gaining ju&s;t Ideas of the general Rights of Mankind na|tural and &s;ocial; of the Laws of Nature and Nations; the municipal Con&s;titutions of his own Country; the Genius and Intere&s;ts of his People; their Connections with, or Dan|gers from their Neighbours; the Methods of be&s;t encrea&s;ing their Numbers, Wealth and Extent; the Laws which will render their Liberties more equal and &s;ecure; their internal Policy more firm; encourage their Trade and Manufactures; promote Virtue and a Spirit of Religion: The good Ruler, in &s;uch a View, e&s;teems his Office a Po&s;t of Care and Burden.</P>
<P>HE is al&s;o &s;ensible, that from a Variety of Cau&s;es he &s;hall have much Trial of his Sted|fa&s;tne&s;s,
<PB N="26" REF="009334_0025_1030E8E4900D2950">
much Anxiety and Grief; that he mu&s;t &s;et his Face forward in Duty as a Flint, re&s;olving that <Q>till he dies his Integrity &s;hall not depart from him.</Q> Aware of his li|mited Capacity of Mind, he fore&s;ees he may advi&s;e to, or vote for Mea&s;ures, which Expe|rience may prove unfit or un&s;alutary. Tho&s;e Evil-doers, to whom he is by his Place to be a Terror, will of Cour&s;e be his avowed Ene|mies, if he &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the Cau&s;e of Order, Peace and Ju&s;tice. The In|firmities of others will give him much Pain. For placed on high, with the Eyes of all fix|ed on him, Cen&s;ures will be frequent and &s;e|vere. The mo&s;t u&s;eful In&s;titutions, if no|vel, often offend by their Novelty; if Re|medies of deep-rooted, long-continued E|vils; &s;ome have found an Advantage in the&s;e Evils, they will be chagrined; the Change is often attended with Perplexities, the good Effects perhaps at a Di&s;tance; the Patriot mu&s;t have much Firmne&s;s to &s;upport him under the Complaints and Obloquy which will be &s;ometimes &s;tirred up. Some think them&s;elves equal to the Government of Provinces and Kingdoms, merely through Want of Sen&s;e; the&s;e are u&s;ually very loud in their Clamours. Others carp becau&s;e

they imagine nothing can be well done but by them&s;elves;&mdash;They are out of Place, they are injured and the Commonwealth &s;uffers.</P>
<P>To conclude here, the wi&s;e and tho'tful Ruler ever con&s;iders him&s;elf, as introduced by the high Monarch of the Univer&s;e, the Judge of All, to his Po&s;t of Dignity. He e&s;teems him&s;elf bound to follow Him who "never &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps," never inter|mits his powerful and gracious Providence. The Vows of GOD are upon him. And when he carries him&s;elf forward to that awful Tribunal, at which the great as well as the &s;mall are to appear, he is convinced, that as he has more Talents to account for the Improvement of than others, his future Reward or Puni&s;hment will be proportiona|bly greater. `How can I,' &s;ays he in his Retirements for Recollection, `How can I bear to hear from the Judge of All, "thou wicked and &s;lothful Servant!" `How can I bear the Woe which tho&s;e de&s;erve who by Breach of Tru&s;t, have been acce&s;&s;ory to the Wrongs of Multitudes, of Peoples and Nations!'</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="009334_0027_1030E8ED618B18E0">BUT the wi&s;e GOD has, in the moral as well as in the natural World, &s;et one Thing over again&s;t another. With his Anxieties and Labours, the Patriot Ruler has al&s;o his Satisfactions and Supports. If he is the Butt of the Querulous and Envious, he has little to fear from Flattery. The Incen&s;e of Pa|ra&s;ites is u&s;ually offered to tho&s;e of other De&s;igns and Tempers. He is &s;ure of the E&s;teem of the di&s;cerning Few, the be&s;t Judges and true&s;t Friends of Merit, who&s;e Opinion only affects a wi&s;e Man's inward. Peace, and a Series of Wi&s;dom and Benefi|cence, will in the long Run be the Object of general Approbation, tho' the Path to &s;uch Honour be tedious and rugged. He will have the con&s;tant Applau&s;e of his own Mind, which like a Shield of Bra&s;s, repels the Darts of Envy, and keeps all calm within. He will enjoy the noble Plea&s;ure of being able to appeal to GOD, "LORD thou knowe&s;t that I have &s;erved thee in Integrity, and done that which is good in thy Sight." He will be able to look forward to the great Day with &s;ublime Joy, when by Faith he views the Judge of All di&s;tributing the Re|wards of Grace, &s;aying, "Well done good and faithful Servant, thou ha&s;t; been faithful

<P>WHEN therefore, <HI>my Hearers,</HI> we de|precate the Advancement of &s;uch to high Offices, who receive them only as a Grati|fication of childi&s;h Vanity, or as the Means, of gratifying &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h paltry Intere&s;t, or who tho' they labour and toil in them, yet 'tis only to &s;atiate &s;ome ugly Pa&s;&s;ion; when, I &s;ay, we pray that this may not be our Fate, we ought with Gratitude to Heaven, to rejoice that our Affairs are hitherto in better Hands.</P>
<P>IT affords the &s;tronge&s;t Pre&s;umption of Capacity, Application and public Spirit in Rulers, when in the Style of Scripture, "All Things go well."

<P><PB N="41" REF="009334_0040_1030E92164E724C0">THE Exaltation of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to the Summit of earthly Grandeur and Glory, was re&s;erved in the Coun&s;els of GOD for the Age and Reign of GEORGE the <HI>Third,</HI>&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed are our Eyes for they &s;ee, our Ears for they hear," tho&s;e great Things, which our Ance&s;tors "de&s;ired to &s;ee and hear, but did not."</P>
<P>WE &s;ee a King on the Throne (&s;ucceed|ing his royal Grandfather, of immortal Me|mory) rejoicing, that, to every other Mo|tive, this of Birth is added, to endear his Subjects to him, to attach him to their Laws and Con&s;titutions, and engage him to Vigi|lance and Zeal for their Protection. While the venerable Foundations of all we hold dear, are guarded with the &s;tricte&s;t Care, while the lowe&s;t Subject is &s;afe as the high|e&s;t, in every Enjoyment he can de&s;ire; the mo&s;t powerful Enemies, the mo&s;t formida|ble Combination of them, have fallen into "the Pit which they them&s;elves digged."</P>
<P>AUSPICIOUS Day! when Britain, the &s;pecial Care of Heaven, ble&s;&s;ed with a pa|triot Sovereign, &s;erved by wi&s;e and faithful Councellors, brave Commanders, &s;ucce&s;sful

<P>HAPPY Sovereign of &s;uch a People, gene|rous Olive-Tree; who&s;e Branches &s;pread out, who&s;e Fruit is di&s;per&s;ed for the Healing of the Nations! Happy I&s;land of his Nativi|ty; ble&s;&s;ed the Womb that bare him! It is GEORGE the <HI>Third,</HI> who gives Peace to half the World. How can Faction but be dumb, contending Parties but melt into gentle Harmony.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e Events, the LORD GOD hath &s;poken, who can but prophecy, "In his Days &s;hall the Righteous flouri&s;h, and A|bundance of Peace &s;o long as the Moon en|dureth: He &s;hall have Dominion from Sea to Sea: They that dwell in the Wilderne&s;s &s;hall bow before him, and his Enemies &s;hall

His Name &s;hall endure forever, his Name &s;hall be continued as long as the Sun."</P>
<P>BUT chiefly thou, O <HI>America,</HI> maye&s;t well rejoice, the Children of <HI>New-England</HI> may be glad and triumph, in Reflection on Events pa&s;t, and Pro&s;pect of the future. Encompa&s;&s;ed with native Savages, our Fa|thers having e&s;caped from Oppre&s;&s;ion, deep|e&s;t felt by pious Minds, carried their Lives in their Hands, &s;ubjected to Captivities, to inhuman Cruelties and Ma&s;&s;acres Encom|pa&s;&s;ed with crafty, faithle&s;s <HI>Europeans,</HI> who &s;ought their Ruin, what Pro&s;pect could they have before them.

<P>NOW commences the AEra of our quiet Enjoyment of tho&s;e Liberties, which our Fathers purcha&s;ed with the Toil of their whole Lives, their Trea&s;ure, their Blood. Safe from the Enemy of the Wilderne&s;s, &s;afe from the griping Hand of arbitrary Sway and cruel Super&s;tition; Here &s;hall be the late founded Seat of Peace and Freedom. Here &s;hall our indulgent Mother, who has mo&s;t generou&s;ly re&s;cued and protected us, be &s;er|ved and honoured by growing Numbers, with all Duty, Love and Gratitude, till Time &s;hall be no more. Here &s;hall be a perennial Source of her Strength and Riches. Here &s;hall Arts and Sciences, the Companions of Tranquility, flouri&s;h. Here &s;hall her new Subjects and their Po&s;terity, ble&s;s the Day, when their imagined Enemies Victories proved to them the Beginning of the mo&s;t valuable Freedom. Here &s;hall dwell un|corrupted Faith, the pure Wor&s;hip of GOD, in its primitive Simplicity, unawed,

"Truth &s;hall &s;pring out of the Earth, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall look down from Hea|ven; yea the Lord &s;hall give that which is is good; Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall go before him, and &s;hall &s;et us in the Way of his Steps."</P>
<P>O that neither we, nor tho&s;e who come after us, may wantonly forfeit the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings and the&s;e Hopes; but by a wi&s;e U&s;e of our di&s;tingui&s;hed Privileges, a moderate and virtuous Enjoyment of the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, and &s;teady living up to the Maxims of our holy Religion, may derive upon our&s;elves and ours, the Continuance of them; for "the Mercy of the Lord is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting, upon them that fear him, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto Children's Children, to &s;uch as keep his Co|venant, and to tho&s;e that remember his Commandments, to do them."</P>
