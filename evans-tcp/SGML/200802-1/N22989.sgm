<HEAD>CHAP. I. THE DECLINE OF DAY.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT con&s;titutes the happine&s;s or unhappine&s;s of our life? It is our character. It is the light in which we view things; in which we feel them, in which they affect us. Abundance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion does not &s;uffice to make a man happy&mdash;he him&s;elf mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of his happine&s;s&mdash;he mu&s;t compare his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to that of others. Education unfolds the character&mdash;the pa&s;&s;ions e&s;tabli&s;h it: It is they that give it that energy, that violence which is augmented by the fire of youth, but tempered with difficulty in riper years.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ions are the in&s;eparable companions of mankind, and in great cities they make the greate&s;t havoc. Ob&s;tacles, de&s;ires, &s;elf-created wants, every thing pro|vokes, every thing creates them. Like bitumen re&s;iding in the heart of metals, they break forth with impetu|o&s;ity, as &s;oon as they have forced the bands of infancy.</P>
<P>Behold a young man who was ju&s;t now under the la&s;h of his preceptor! Death bereft him of his parents: He is free; he is his own ma&s;ter; what a happine&s;s!
<PB N="2" REF="030364_0004_0FE5D133D9A6C1D8">
How will he enjoy it! Whole crowds of plea&s;ures take his fancy: which of them will he prefer? Doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t turbulent, they appear &s;o &s;educing? Bu&s;tle, balls, a&s;&s;emblies, races by day!&mdash;great projects for the night; by night, great projects for the day! He is always bu&s;y about nothing; the plea&s;ure he ta&s;tes to|day is nothing compared to that he will ta&s;te tomor|row: That which he has enjoyed ye&s;terday is already forgotten. What pains does he take to amu&s;e him&s;elf! The gaming table&mdash;the theatres&mdash;LOVE! Why do I call it love? Can I thus pro&s;titute this word? Can I give the title of love to the inordinate appetites of the &s;en&s;es, which ince&s;&s;antly pervade his heart; that in&s;a|tiable de&s;ire, gratified with brutality and without choice, that incon&s;tant phrenzy, which makes him rove from <HI>belle</HI> to <HI>belle?</HI> Nay, he &s;acrifices all, enjoys before he thinks, and thinks at the age of enjoyment. Unfortunate he! a burden to &s;ociety, to him&s;elf; at the age of thirty he may renounce life!</P>
<P>The&s;e, the&s;e are the fatal con&s;equences of pa&s;&s;ions, in great cities. Let us now con&s;ider tho&s;e of the hamlets&mdash;let us examine the countrymen, I mean not the countrymen in the environs of Paris. Unfortunately the contagion has &s;pread beyond the &s;uburbs; but him that inhabits the remote provinces of B&eacute;auce or B&eacute;arn. Behold the lad at work&mdash;in his father's eyes, his age is eighteen, yet he appears to be twenty five: His nervous limbs control the plough&s;hare; his callous hands thru&s;t the &s;pade into the bo&s;om of the earth, dragging the harrow, or lifting the flail: They thre&s;h the corn, and each &s;troke is accompanied by a hardy <HI>hah!</HI> which &s;prings from his vigorous brea&s;t. By day he lays up a copious &s;tore of <HI>pavots</HI> for the night&mdash;by night, nothing puts him in mind of his exi&s;tence, not even the &s;lighte&s;t dream, except &s;ometimes certain &s;weet illu&s;ions, which point, in a plea&s;ing manner, the labor of the approaching day. He al&s;o thinks on his plea&s;ures (for they are great objects to all men) but how innocent are they? A party at bowls, a dance in the environs of the village. The greate&s;t part of the Sunday he devotes to the &s;ervice of his God. He goes to church, not by con&s;traint, or for the &s;ake of decorum, but by habit and duty. There he &s;its with his hands

joined, and his eyes fixed upon his prie&s;t, who in a decayed and rough chair, at the foot of the altar, preaches maxims, which, although they be not embel|li&s;hed by the captious beauties of oratory, are however true, and adapted to the under&s;tandings of the auditors, who li&s;ten to them with keen attention, and during the whole week make them the object of their reflections.</P>
<P>In this picture, which will perhaps appear flattering. I paint the countrymen at large. I am convinced that there are vicious people in the country, as well as in town; but how rare are they among ru&s;tics? They have in other re&s;pects two excellent remedies again&s;t irk&s;omene&s;s and di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;labor and &s;leep. Among us, irk&s;omene&s;s is productive of vices, and vices beget infirmities&mdash;Among them, labor procures re&s;t, and re&s;t fo&s;ters health.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, education, which, added to our calling, or profe&s;&s;ion, forms the character, the affec|tions and pa&s;&s;ions of men: A college education leads often to ambition, to jealou&s;y, to turbulence, and points out what conduct a man ought to ob&s;erve, in order to maintain his place in the &s;tormy &s;ociety of cities. The pupil of nature, in her rural abode, is taught by her temperance, virtue and religion.</P>
<P>Oh! who has not felt that tranquility of mind, that admiration of a Supreme Being, when erring &s;olitary through the ru&s;tic path? who has not &s;topt with a&s;ton|i&s;hment, before a horizon, covered with vines, woods, meadows, hamlets, and cottages? The joyful lap&s;e of a ca&s;cade throws him into a &s;weet reverie! The regular noi&s;e of a neighboring mill entertains his melancholy&mdash;a religious calm reigns all around him&mdash;the &s;un &s;ets, he &s;ees laborers pa&s;s by, laden with tools, women and children carrying long faggots upon their backs; he hears at a di&s;tance the &s;ound of the &s;hepherd's horn, who calls back his flocks to their folds; &s;low and confu&s;ed &s;ounds &s;trike his ears; a little har&s;h and di&s;cordant pipe is heard at intervals&mdash;he de&s;cries amid&s;t the darkne&s;s the &s;cintillating flame of a limekiln; he looks at it without &s;eeing it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he thinks without reflecting: His &s;pirits are in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e: He feels too much to give a detail of his &s;en&s;ations. Rou&s;ed at la&s;t, from his extacy, every thing recalls him to his

hermitage: He enters joyfully to &s;ee his little man&s;ion and garden; he makes a tour round it, and remembers with delight the plea&s;ures of the day. Nay, how would it be po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould forget his walk; He has &s;een nature: He has meditated: He has enjoyed!</P>
<P>What a &s;triking contra&s;t between the &s;ilence of the country and the bu&s;tle of cities!</P>
<P>Let the proud citizen of Paris leave the capital and walk only to the di&s;tance of half a league; let him a&s;cend one of the&s;e &s;urrounding mounts, and ca&s;t his eyes upon the turbulent city: What will he &s;ee? A thick blacki&s;h fog encompa&s;&s;ing the whole ma&s;s of its &s;uperb edifice, a mephitic horizon, which &s;eems too heavy to emit its exhalations! Let him hear the con|fu&s;ed tumult of carriages, of dogs and hor&s;es; let his ears tingle with the &s;hrill voices of &s;o many people who overrun the &s;pacious di&s;tricts&mdash;what will he then feel? He will fetch a &s;igh: Philo&s;ophical reflections will occupy his mind: He will ca&s;t a longing look upon the ru&s;tic &s;eats which &s;urround him. After having prolonged his excur&s;ion, he will reenter Paris with a kind of &s;adne&s;s, which he does not account for, and which nothing can di&s;&s;ipate but the hope of &s;eeing again tho&s;e peaceful &s;cenes.</P>
<P>Such were the thoughts of <HI>Alexis,</HI> when he left the gates of Valence. Alone, on foot, with his little bag|gage under his arm, he turned round, and made &s;everal &s;tops, to have another view of the walls and edifices of this fine capital of the province of Valenti|noi&s;e, where he had ju&s;t left the deare&s;t and perhaps the mo&s;t perfidious friend. He continued his road, and at la&s;t nothing remained to his view, but the &s;ummits of the capital, and the a&s;piring towers of an abbey. Not knowing whither to repair, he arrives on the &s;pot where the river I&s;ere, coming from mount I&s;&s;erano, in Savoy, pours into the Rhone the waters which made it &s;well in Dauphiny. There he turns to the left of Romano, and enters a va&s;t plain, where fatigue engages him to take repo&s;e. He drops down at the foot of a beach, and with &s;ighs reflects upon the motives which could induce his father to abandon him.</P>
<P>The day was upon the decline; nothing but the faint &s;treaks of decrea&s;ing light twinkled from the we&s;t:
<PB N="5" REF="030364_0007_0FE5D13B2CCD6FC8">
Curtains of purple &s;eemed to hide the father of day from the &s;ight of mortals: He already ca&s;t his la&s;t rays upon the brow of the mountains&mdash;all u&s;hered in the gloom of night&mdash;all united to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Alexis, &s;upporting his langui&s;hing head with his hand, let the evening gale &s;port with the floating ring|lets of his hair; his blue eyes, covered with the brine of woe, were lifted towards heaven: his mouth utter|ed moans and prayer to the Supreme Being! Alexis, though only fifteen, was unfortunate and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Oh! father! father! cried he, what have I done? What can&s;t thou upbraid me with? Why reject me from thy bo&s;om? What crime have I committed? O my father! I do not know&mdash;they are not voluntary, if they exi&s;t. They are &s;urely the work of fate. I am the cau&s;e of thy misfortunes. Alas! could&s;t thou but know the heart of thy &s;on; yes, thy poor Alexis, he would fain offer up his life to pre&s;erve thine. How did&s;t thou love and cheri&s;h him! How often did&s;t thou pre&s;s him to thy paternal brea&s;t! How often did thy tears &s;hower upon him, tears who&s;e &s;ource was latent and unknown to him! It was in tho&s;e delicious moments thou called&s;t him thy &s;on; thy little Alexis. "Dear child," thou woulde&s;t &s;ay, "no, thou &s;halt never leave me; thou &s;halt know thy father, know his misfortunes, and admini&s;ter his comfort." Yet I am bani&s;hed and cur&s;ed by thee. Have I de&s;erved it? Mu&s;t I &s;ee thee no more? No more thy arms will open to receive me; thy mouth will &s;mile no more; thy eyes no more meet with mine. I am cur&s;ed by a father, and left alone to my&s;elf in nature. And you, Dumont, you my worthy friend, you too have abandoned and betray|ed Alexis: You have deceived me&mdash;Ah! it was well to tell me there was neither friend&s;hip nor probity on earth. All men are fal&s;e, wicked and unju&s;t: The &s;tronge&s;t oppre&s;s the weake&s;t, who mu&s;t not look for &s;upport. Well, I will fly from mankind&mdash;I dete&s;t and abhor them. O could heaven lead me to &s;ome fore&s;t, where I may linger out this wretched exi&s;tence. The wild bea&s;ts that inhabit it, are le&s;s dangerous than the perfidious &s;erpents which lurk in &s;ociety. Yes, I yield

to this mi&s;anthropy&mdash;it plea&s;es me, I &s;hall &s;way my heart forever with &s;overeign control. This city which nature erected in the form of an amphitheatre,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans,</NOTE> does al&s;o enclo&s;e men. Pa&s;&s;ions, cares, devouring ambition, all the&s;e &s;courges are tenants there. Now is the time when the rich &s;huts him&s;elf up in his clo&s;et, covetou&s;|ne&s;s follows him, &s;he opens his coffers, &s;he &s;preads before him the trea&s;ures, which &s;he made him ama&s;s, and points out fre&s;h means of increa&s;ing them. Leav|ing him, this cunning foe pa&s;&s;es by the beggar's hut, &s;hews him for a moment her &s;plendor, and then takes flight, with an in&s;ulting &s;neer, at the in&s;atiable thir&s;t of the former, and the vain cravings of the latter Delivered from her importunities, the lot of a man is not in the lea&s;t more enviable; perfidious lu&s;t, gloomy jealou&s;y, come to interrupt and di&s;turb his ea&s;e. Day|light, after all, recalls him to the work, which he follows till night, then returns again to give him up to the &s;ame enemies; and thus he &s;u&s;tains, within the &s;hort &s;pace of twenty-four hours, all the pa&s;&s;ions with which he is obliged to &s;truggle for life.</P>
<P>What do I &s;ee in the world? How vain, fooli&s;h, and ridiculous it appears! Shall I live in it? No, I will pa&s;s my days in a retreat &s;eparated from all other mortals; there will I bewail my di&s;a&s;trous fate; there will I invoke the Supreme Being, and prayers may perhaps re&s;tore the calm of my &s;oul; there &s;olitude at lea&s;t will have nothing to interrupt it, but the remembrance of a father's cur&s;e, and a friend's treachery.&mdash;</P>
<P>Thus &s;poke Alexis.&mdash;Left to him&s;elf at fifteen, brought up by a man who &s;aw every thing in a dark light, bani&s;hed and cur&s;ed by a father he had &s;carcely known, and who&s;e very name he had never heard; his ideas became gloomy, his mind exalted, and his &s;oul a prey to grief. Little was he acquainted with men. and &s;hunned and dete&s;ted them as mon&s;ters! His &s;oul was never made to be conquered by that black mi&s;an|thropy, the only re&s;ult of education and misfortunes. Soon &s;hall we &s;ee him acquire ideas more &s;ound, more worthy of a true philo&s;opher&mdash;We are to &s;ee him in di&s;tre&s;s, but from his own fault, from an exce&s;&s;ive

&s;en&s;ibility; and he will be convinced, at la&s;t, that &s;ince we are obliged to live among&s;t our fellow crea|tures, we mu&s;t bear their failings as they do ours.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Alexis fini&s;hed his over &s;trained complaints, than a &s;oft noi&s;e, which he heard behind him, made him turn his head. What does he &s;ee? Ah! doubtle&s;s it was heaven, touched by his bitter moans, which had &s;ent him comfort in his &s;ufferings.</P>

<P>ALEXIS MEETS A FRIEND OF CONGENIAL SENTI|MENTS.&mdash;AN INTERVIEW.&mdash;PASSAGE TOWARDS THE COTTAGE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE APPROACH TO THE COTTAGE.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUTH of an intere&s;ting countenance was with his head and hands leaning again&s;t the tree, beneath which Alexis had taken re&s;t. A little farther his hor&s;e, unbridled, was brow&s;ing the vernal pa&s;ture of the plain; near him was an old man, who carefully watched all his motions.</P>
<P>Alexis, &s;urpri&s;ed that an unknown youth &s;hould te&s;tify concern at his fate, was going to a&s;k him the nature of a curio&s;ity which rather offended him; but the young &s;tranger prevented him by the&s;e words,&mdash;"You are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed?"&mdash;"Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, you &s;ay&mdash;what has befallen you? what can it be to you?"&mdash;"Nay, be not angry&mdash;if you knew me!"&mdash;"Who are you?"&mdash;Well, he will know my &s;ecret, though he conceals his own.&mdash;"Why it is rather&mdash;<HI>how</HI> do you find me?&mdash;Such a que&s;tion is natural. As for me, I cannot help telling you that I look upon you as very amiable."&mdash;"Amiable!"&mdash;"Yes, charming." This confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;"but pray who are you?"&mdash;"Can't you gue&s;s?"&mdash;"No,"&mdash;"'Tis my dre&s;s which cau&s;es your mi&s;take; know me then: My name is Clara, I live with my father, in a fore&s;t, two leagues from hence."&mdash;"In a fore&s;t?"&mdash;"Yes, we are very happy there."&mdash;"I believe you." "The old man who &s;tands yonder, is Germain, our tru&s;ty &s;ervant."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="030364_0010_0FE5D141459F83A0">
But, fair Clara, what could induce your father to bani&s;h him&s;elf thus?"&mdash;"I don't know, it is his own &s;ecret, but he will tell it you." "Tell it me?"&mdash;"Certainly, won't you come and &s;tay with us?"&mdash;"Why do you a&s;k me?"&mdash;"Have not I overheard all you &s;aid, <HI>Oh, would heaven lead me to &s;ome fore&s;t, where I might linger out this wretched exi&s;tence.</HI>&mdash;Is not that plain enough?"&mdash;"Aye, it is &s;o, I find town life is dete&s;table."&mdash;"You well may, my father &s;ays &s;o every day."&mdash;"What a &s;ingular adventure! your father?"&mdash;"Yes, he has been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed too, come and live in his hermitage, you will con&s;ole him, and I will con&s;ole you."&mdash;"Clara, you begin already to make me forget my &s;orrows; the tone of your voice is &s;o &s;oothing,"&mdash;"So is your own."&mdash;"Well, you have been brought up in the woods?"&mdash;"Yes, my father has been living there the&s;e &s;ix years."&mdash;"And how old are you?"&mdash;"About fifteen."&mdash;"What a beautiful, what an intere&s;ting maid!"&mdash;"Yes, my father and Germain often told me I was hand&s;ome, and I am plea&s;ed that you think as they do."&mdash;What innocence! what &s;implicity! Oh, I have never been taught to hide my way of thinking, have I then met with an ingenuous and hone&s;t &s;oul? Yes, &s;he has been brought up in the woods! "Oh! you talk like my father; how he will like you! Come, give me your hand; ri&s;e, and we will go."&mdash;"But do you know whether your father will plea&s;e to receive me?"&mdash;"Oh! he will be glad to &s;ee you, I am certain; I know him; he loves the unfortunate, he has been unfortunate him&s;elf."&mdash;"That is no rea&s;on; but what an impre&s;&s;ion your di&s;|cour&s;e makes on me!"&mdash;"Well, there is but one thing in you that di&s;plea&s;es me."&mdash;"What is that?"&mdash;"Are you not &s;ometimes a little proud? I love familiarity, but come then, come along."</P>
<P>When Alexis was fir&s;t acco&s;ted by the young &s;tranger, he had been quite &s;truck dumb, and even on account of his mi&s;tru&s;t, would not believe what Clara &s;aid in the beginning, but &s;he was &s;o charming! candour and innocence, the &s;mile of truth, all indicated the frank|ne&s;s of her &s;oul; and her features, how beautiful were they; her hair, of an a&s;h-colored fair, was negligently tied behind; a little round hat, with a ribbon only,
<PB N="9" REF="030364_0011_0FE5D14299551798">
di&s;covered two large blue eyes, who&s;e languor pene|trated to the heart; her mouth, with a &s;mile, formed on each &s;ide two pretty dimples which love is &s;aid to have intended to &s;often the mo&s;t obdurate heart; her cheeks glowing with health and ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, had only received the ki&s;&s;es of an affectionate father. A handkerchief pa&s;&s;ed &s;lightly round her neck, and falling upon her bo&s;om, left the eye to gue&s;s the beauties hid beneath. Her &s;hape, veiled with a mode&s;t blue habit, was pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;er by a broad girdle, who&s;e ends hung negligently down her &s;ide. Clara, to &s;o many charms, added the age of love, and her heart, attracted by nature, had made her fly, again&s;t her con&s;ent, towards a youth whom &s;he had found &s;ighing and melted into tears at the foot of a tree.</P>
<P>Alexis &s;urveyed her, and &s;truck with &s;o many beau|ties, his eye over-ran them with rapture. He opens his mouth to expre&s;s his &s;urpri&s;e, but his tongue denies its office, and he utters only wild exclamations. He holds out his hand to the object he admires, a &s;udden blu&s;h diffu&s;es it&s;elf over his face, a burning fire glides through his veins, he is unable to &s;peak, but his heart beats high, it comes upon his lips; it animates his looks, which only interpret his meaning.</P>
<P>He recovers, however, from his rapture, his timidity &s;till gets the better; he turns his &s;ight from the fair object, &s;tammers a few words, and hangs down his head with &s;uch ba&s;hful confu&s;ion as if con&s;cious he had committed a crime. Oh! how pure are the fir&s;t emo|tions of an hone&s;t love! What candor and mode&s;ty di&s;plays that heart which feels them.</P>
<P>Clara's quiet was di&s;turbed in the &s;ame manner. Brought up in the woods, accu&s;tomed to &s;ee nobody but her father and Germain, the &s;ight of this intere&s;t|ing youth had made an impre&s;&s;ion on her &s;en&s;es, to which &s;he gave her&s;elf up entirely, without inquiring into the cau&s;e. She looked at Alexis, and &s;aid within her&s;elf&mdash;How well made is he! what beautiful hair! how pretty it curls! his &s;weet and rolling eye examines me! he finds me pretty! Oh, dear plea&s;ure! and his mouth, it opens to &s;peak to me;&mdash;it remains dumb&mdash;why?&mdash;but his heart.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="030364_0012_0FE5D14363FD41C0">
The two children remained for &s;ome time gazing on each other. At length Clara, inviting Alexis to come with her, by a &s;ignificant look, and a &s;light motion of her head, folded her arm round his neck, and thus they walked, without uttering a word, towards the place where Germain &s;tood waiting for them. Wait|ing for <HI>them,</HI> do I &s;ay? He could not think that his young mi&s;tre&s;s would pre&s;ent a &s;tranger to him. What reception will he give him? This was all that perplex|ed Clara. Eager to make Alexis live in the cottage, &s;he had not pondered the difficulties her de&s;ign was likely to encounter, not with regard to her father, for &s;he was &s;ure of the reception he would give to an un|fortunate youth; but Germain was mi&s;tru&s;tful, hard, in&s;en&s;ible, and unfortunately enjoyed the entire confi|dence of his ma&s;ter. A young man bani&s;hed, cur&s;ed by his parents, friendle&s;s, without &s;helter, all this excited &s;u&s;picion. Poor Clara felt it, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore afraid le&s;t the old &s;ervant &s;hould treat her young friend rudely, and &s;end him away.</P>
<P>Her unea&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed the more &s;he advanced towards this au&s;tere Mentor. At la&s;t &s;he comes up to him, &s;he mu&s;t acco&s;t and appri&s;e him. What an em|barra&s;&s;ment! "Germain," &s;ays &s;he, "You love my father, you know how unfortunate he has been! you comforted him, and diverted his tedious moments. Let us render the &s;ame &s;ervice to this poor youth; he is as virtuous and innocent as any one; and, alas! fate pur&s;ues him as it pur&s;ued my father;"&mdash;"How do you know him, Clara?" &s;aid Germain.&mdash;"He was weeping and &s;ighing beneath yon tree; I approached, he related to me his misfortunes, and I was happy to wipe away his tears."&mdash;"Young man, who art thou?"&mdash;"Good old man, I am nothing, unle&s;s you reckon it &s;omething to be a fellow creature."&mdash;"Of what country?"&mdash;"I cannot tell."&mdash;"Your father's name?"&mdash;"I know not."&mdash;"What is his profe&s;&s;ion?"&mdash;"Alas! I cannot tell."&mdash;"You cannot tell?"&mdash;"No, he cur&s;ed and bani&s;hed me, and never let me know my crime."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Alexis was &s;aying this Clara whi&s;pered him quite low, "Hu&s;h, why do you tell him that?" but Alexis proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030364_0013_0FE5D14B46940948">
"Till now he had me educated at a college, at Paris. He once loved me."</P>
<P>"Your an&s;wers," &s;aid Germain, "are &s;o many enigmas; and you, Clara, what makes you bring this &s;tranger to me? What is your de&s;ign? What would you have <HI>me</HI> do, what does he want of me?"</P>
<P>Alexis, fore&s;eeing a refu&s;al in this que&s;tion of the old man, could not re&s;train his indignation. "I want nothing," an&s;wered he, angrily, and &s;prung from them, ca&s;ting a look of melancholy towards Clara, who felt its full force. "Only &s;ee," &s;aid &s;he to Germain, "&s;ee, he goes away; the poor youth; you will not prevent him. Alexis, Alexis!"</P>
<P>But Alexis would not hear her, and running like a man who has committed a crime, he con&s;idered what had happened as a great in&s;ult, which ought forever to cover him with &s;hame. "What, &s;aid he, &s;obbing, I believed I had found a generous heart; I conde&s;cend|ed to &s;olicit &s;helter and have been refu&s;ed; I ought to have expected it. The man who is pro&s;perous in all, &s;ees the &s;orrow of the wretched as he who has dined views the poor &s;tarved with hunger. Nobody will de&s;cend into the heart of the unfortunate. One always finds fault with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to exempt one's &s;elf from alleviating his &s;orrows. I will follow my fate, I will forget this adventure; but, Clara, I &s;hall &s;ee thee no more! Thy &s;oul had judged mine; thy pity was &s;in|cere. One only being &s;hares in my &s;ufferings, and I cannot live near her! O God, O God!"</P>
<P>He could proceed no further: His heart was op|pre&s;&s;ed with renewed grief, tears flowed from his eyes, and he gave him&s;elf up to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>He pur&s;ued his way, not daring to look back, le&s;t he might meet Germain's eye, and wandered thus two hours, without knowing whither, when the pro&s;pect of a little wood offered it&s;elf to his view, and here he re&s;olved to pa&s;s the night.</P>
<P>It was in the month of June; the moon &s;hone in her full lu&s;tre; a light breeze refre&s;hed the air, and twenty green &s;ods pre&s;ented a commodious bed to the &s;traying traveller. Alexis did not he&s;itate: He addre&s;&s;es, as u&s;ual, a prayer to the Supreme Being, and throws him|&s;elf upon a ri&s;ing turf at the entrance of a little wood.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="030364_0014_0FE5D14C12E280D0">
There, &s;tretched upon the gra&s;s, which he bedewed with his tears, lay poor Alexis, who, but the night before, was with his friend Dumont, received from him the mo&s;t affectionate marks of the livelie&s;t friend|&s;hip, and flattered him&s;elf with the hope of embracing his father at the ri&s;ing dawn. He had indeed &s;een that cruel father, but far from being care&s;&s;ed, &s;uffered his angrie&s;t looks, and his malediction. Lo! what a change in his fate! Behold him alone, left to him&s;elf; fatherle&s;s, friendle&s;s, de&s;titute; life an odious burden to him; he yields it up to the mercy of ferocious animals, of robbers, and already ble&s;&s;es the hand of the cruel being that will take it from him.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t clo&s;ed his reflections, and the &s;alutary balm of &s;leep was beginning to lull his &s;en&s;es, and make him lo&s;e the remembrance of his ills, when he was alarmed by loud &s;hrieks, and could di&s;tingui&s;h a voice, crying, "O heavens! will you kill me? Have pity on my tender years." Alexis jumps up, the voice affects him, he thinks he knows it, and flies to the &s;pot from which the moans proceed. Horrible &s;ight! Will his heart be able to bear it? A youth, covered with blood, whom a ruffian dragged by the hair, implored his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, 'Tis Clara, cried Alexis&mdash;ru&s;hing upon the barbarian, he re&s;cues her. The wretch&punc; foaming with rage, draws a pi&s;tol from his pocket, and is about to fire it, when Alexis, &s;pringing upon him, wre&s;ted the weapon from his hand, and &s;hoots him dead.</P>
<P>Clara, who had fainted, no &s;ooner opened her eyes than &s;he recogni&s;ed her deliverer. "Is it you? <HI>you</HI> to whom I owe my life? O unexpected happine&s;s!"&mdash;"But, Clara," &s;aid Alexis, "where is Germain?"&mdash;"About twenty yards farther, and dangerou&s;ly wounded."&mdash;"Let us fly to him."</P>
<P>They found the old man upon the ground weltering in his blood. "Is it you," &s;aid he, "is it you, my Clara? what deity re&s;tores you to my wi&s;hes?"&mdash;"Here he is Germain I know my defender; it is Alexis!"&mdash;"What, that young man?"&mdash;"The &s;ame."&mdash;"O generous &s;tranger! how great are my obligations to you! I &s;hall re&s;tore a daughter to a father; through you I &s;hall die contented."&mdash;"You die!" replied Alexis, "let me not lo&s;e the benefit of the &s;ervice I
<PB N="13" REF="030364_0015_0FE5D14CDA8BA780">
have been &s;o fortunate to render you."&mdash;"Give me your hand then," &s;aid Germain, "and deign to crown this heroic &s;eat, by accompanying us to the virtuous Candor, to whom we are equally dear."</P>
<P>Alexis and Clara helped Germain to ri&s;e, and &s;topped his blood with their handkerchiefs. His wound was not dangerous; he had only a &s;light contu&s;ion upon his &s;houlder, and a great lo&s;s of blood alone had weakened him. The two young people, with &s;ome difficulty, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to mount his hor&s;e; Clara got up behind him, and thus, followed by Alexis, they proceeded to the next village, which they reached by day-break.</P>
<P>Upon the road, Clara informed her young deliverer, that &s;he and Germain, having lo&s;t their way, and being &s;en&s;ible they had rode farther than the di&s;tance from Romans to their cottage, they fell in, about twenty yards from the little wood, with a robber, who de|manded their money, or their lives; that the wretch had fired a pi&s;tol at Germain, and &s;he having told him that &s;he was a woman, he dragged her to the place where he received the puni&s;hment due to his crimes. She added that if any thing could comfort her in this cruel accident, it was to have met with a friend &s;o high in her e&s;teem, and who hereafter would be the friend of her father and his old &s;ervant.</P>
<P>Alexis returned thanks for her concern, and our three travellers reached <HI>St. Marcellin,</HI> a pretty little town, where Germain remembered he had been many a time. They would have done better had they gone &s;traight to <HI>La Perriere,</HI> a village on this &s;ide the town; but quite unacquainted with the road, they &s;trayed &s;o much from the high way, that having gained the right &s;hore of the I&s;er they were obliged to travel two leagues farther in order to reach <HI>St. Marcellin.</HI></P>
<P>It was there Germain had his wound dre&s;&s;ed, and finding he had &s;trength &s;ufficient to ride farther, he engaged his young companions to repair in&s;tantly with him to the cottage, where Candor would probably be alarmed at their ab&s;ence. Clara longed to &s;ee him. Alexis &s;eared his pre&s;ence, from his invincible timidity, for he was &s;till di&s;mayed at the cold reception which
<PB N="14" REF="030364_0016_0FE5D14D9E583040">
Germain had given him: He was afraid le&s;t Clara's father &s;hould treat him in the &s;ame manner, and could not help appearing trembling before him; but Candor's daughter cheered his &s;pirits; and having &s;et out all three, they came in &s;ight of a dark fore&s;t, &s;ituated between <HI>St. Marcellin, St. Etienne,</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> This fore&s;t, which is about ten leagues in extent, and is renowned for robbers, and the precipices di&s;per&s;ed throughout it, &s;eemed to be the marked &s;pot of cele&s;tial vengeance. Its den&s;e and lofty trees were continually &s;hivered by the lightning, and bla&s;ting winds &s;pent their rage upon it without intermi&s;&s;ion. Every appear|ance denoted horror and dread.</P>
<P>It was, however, in the centre of this di&s;mal place, where Candor and his daughter had cho&s;en their abode. It was there they had erected their cottage, and forti|fied it again&s;t &s;urpri&s;e; but I ought not to anticipate a de&s;cription which will be given hereafter. Let us, for a moment, follow our three travellers, who will &s;oon reach their man&s;ion, and receive the embraces of a father who will become the father of my hero.</P>
<P>Clara, always behind the old man, held Alexis by the hand, who, like a faithful &s;quire, walked on foot by her &s;ide. They had by this time travelled about four leagues through the bu&s;hes and hedges of the va&s;t fore&s;t, when they de&s;cried in a dale a little fortre&s;s which Alexis &s;urveyed with a&s;toni&s;hment. Here Clara, gently pre&s;&s;ing the youth's hand, with a &s;mile, &s;aid to him&mdash;<HI>"There, do you &s;ee the cottage?"</HI></P>

<P>"THERE, <HI>do you &s;ee the cottage?"</HI> it is there we live, and there it will depend on your&s;elf to live with us."&mdash;"Ah! Clara," &s;aid Alexis, "What a
<PB N="15" REF="030364_0017_0FE5D1550A15D150">
delicious abode! how ble&s;t would be my lot if your father, if Germain&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Doubt it not, my lovely deliverer," an&s;wered Germain, "doubt it not, but before you &s;ettle there, ponder well what you are about to do; to renounce the world is the que&s;tion, and at your age&mdash;"</P>
<P>"It is the very time I &s;hould renounce it," cried Alexis, "had I done it before, I would not have &s;uffer|ed &s;o much now."</P>
<P>"But have mankind already given you &s;o much rea|&s;on to dete&s;t them?" "Tho&s;e who were dear to me have betrayed me; what can I expect from &s;trangers?"</P>
<P>"You perhaps con&s;ider them in a prejudiced light."</P>
<P>"Oh! I have but too much experience."</P>
<P>"But if you dete&s;t the men, do you al&s;o include in your hatred that noble half of &s;ociety, which a&s;&s;uages our &s;orrows, and which, by love, allays the grief cau&s;ed by friend&s;hip! women! will you fly them at eighteen?"</P>
<P>"Ah! I &s;ee them all in Clara."</P>
<P>"That's right," replied &s;he with vivacity; "as for me, I &s;ee all men in my father, my good friend, and Alexis."</P>
<P>"Young people," pur&s;ued Germain, "be on your guard, beware of your hearts; love in the mid&s;t of woods?"</P>
<P>"What do you mean," interrupted Clara, "what, &s;hould I love him? No, I am concerned at his fate becau&s;e he is unfortunate, and I owe him the gratitude due to a deliverer."</P>
<P>"And I," &s;aid Alexis, "&s;hould be much wanting in duty, were I in&s;en&s;ible of her generous offer, and the manner &s;he con&s;oled me in my afflictions."</P>
<P>"Without doubt!" continued the old man, &s;haking his head; "friend&s;hip, gratitude, they are all fine pretences; come, come, march on." Such was their conver&s;ation, when the cottage appeared before them; a fo&s;&s;e full of water guarded its dominion all round to the bottom of a high and &s;trong wall, which encom|pa&s;&s;ed a &s;pacious yard, in the middle of which the little edifice &s;tood. A draw bridge that could be let down upon the fo&s;&s;e, defended the entrance again&s;t the robbers who made the fore&s;t their abode.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="030364_0018_0FE5D156A6FDC408">
Candor, alarmed at the long ab&s;ence of his two ten|ants, had mounted the walls at day break, and ca&s;t his wi&s;hful eyes upon the dreary expan&s;e of the woods, in which he feared &s;ame accident might have befallen them. Clara's father was old and infirm, and &s;carce able to walk; but he no &s;ooner de&s;cried his dear gue&s;ts from a di&s;tance, than he de&s;cended from the wall, leaned upon his &s;taff, and his heart leaping for joy, he let down the draw bridge, the levers of which were made lighter by a counterpoi&s;e. He, however, expected his friends alone: He &s;aw three approach. He did not know the &s;tranger who led Clara by the hand, and to whom Ger|main &s;poke in &s;o affectionate a manner. They had no acquaintance; he him&s;elf in his &s;olitude where he lived unknown had forgot all mankind, who had al&s;o forgot him. Who then was the youth they brought? His mode&s;t exterior, his &s;weet countenance, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him in his favor; but after all, he could by no means recollect him.</P>
<P>The good Candor, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e reflections, &s;aw our two cavaliers alight before the premi&s;es. "O my father," &s;aid Clara, throwing her&s;elf into his arms; "we have been on the point of never &s;eeing you again!"&mdash;"How, my dear daughter?"&mdash;"A villain," continued Clara, "has wounded Germain, and would have taken away my life, but for the bravery of this traveller, who delived me out of his clutches, and inflicted that puni&s;hment upon him, which he &s;o well de&s;erved."&mdash;"O my child: What! Germain?"</P>
<P>"Indeed," an&s;wered he, "we would both have been lo&s;t, without the poor Alexis, this courageous youth: He is very unfortunate, my dear ma&s;ter; give me leave to tell you how we met with him; and it will convince you of his virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, and his delicacy."</P>
<P>Here Germain gave Clara's father a minute account of all that had happened; he mentioned fir&s;t the con|ver&s;ation with Alexis in the valley of Romans, and related every &s;ub&s;equent particular to the moment when they alighted before the draw bridge of the cottage, dwelling chiefly upon the abrupt manner in which Alexis had left them the night before, which he &s;aid, in his opinion, proceeded from a &s;en&s;e of conviction
<PB N="17" REF="030364_0019_0FE5D157991DA060">
that he would not take him with him; this he men|tioned as a proof of his &s;en&s;ibility and his nice feelings.</P>
<P>Our young hero was much embarra&s;&s;ed during this conver&s;ation: His head hung down, his eyes were fixed upon the ground; he dared not lift them upon the old man, who&s;e reverend appearance increa&s;ed his &s;hyne&s;s; his heart was depre&s;&s;ed and he appeared as if ready to &s;woon. On the other hand, Clara made comments on every thing that Germain &s;aid, in order to add to the prai&s;e, the eagerly con&s;ulted her father's eyes to watch what impre&s;&s;ion the narrative would make upon him.</P>
<P>When Germain had done &s;peaking, Candor pau&s;ed a moment, and then, addre&s;&s;ing Alexis, who now trembled more than ever, "Young man," &s;aid he, "what is your age?"&mdash;"I &s;hall &s;oon be eighteen."&mdash;"Eighteen, and &s;o much virtue, &s;uch misfortunes, and &s;uch courage! Do you wi&s;h to live with us? come, you are too timid, &s;peak, I love the unfortunate; they have a claim upon my heart."</P>
<P>"Generous man!" cried Alexis, "what concern he gives me!"</P>
<P>"Will you then renounce &s;ociety and fly all &s;ocial intercour&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Why, are not all men fal&s;e, wicked, and treach|erous?"</P>
<P>How well he knows them! "But, my young friend, I cannot receive you into my hou&s;e, unle&s;s you give me an open and candid account of your misfor|tunes and &s;ituation: I wi&s;h al&s;o to know if your rea&s;ons for quitting &s;ociety are &s;olid and con&s;i&s;tent?"</P>
<P>"They are, and &s;hall be forever!"</P>
<P>"Well, people at your age are generally of a dif|ferent way of thinking: But at mine they are prudent and con&s;i&s;tent. The man who would leave me at the fir&s;t opportunity, &s;hall have no acce&s;s to my hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"I will never leave you, my father, no, never."</P>
<P><HI>Father!</HI> how he moves me! alas, my &s;on would now have been as old as he! his frankne&s;s! I &s;aw him expire before my eyes; unfortunate child!</P>
<P>Here, Candor wiped the tears which trickled from his eyes, and, re&s;uming his former firmne&s;s&mdash;"Come,
<PB N="18" REF="030364_0020_0FE5D158ABF87C28">
Alexis, come, accept a &s;helter offered by friend&s;hip, but remember that this gate which is going to be &s;hut will never open for you again."</P>
<P>Alexis ki&s;&s;ed the hand of his benefactor, and Clara was tran&s;ported with joy, and all four pa&s;&s;ed over the draw bridge, which flew up &s;uddenly behind them. Now our hero had a di&s;tinct view of the cottage, which the high walls that were its defence, had hitherto concealed from him.</P>
<P>The building was &s;quare, con&s;i&s;ted of free&s;tone, and was but one &s;tory high, without ornaments, without the beauties of architecture, it contained every dome&s;tic convenience. Below was a kitchen, and an oven to bake the bread, &amp;c. The fir&s;t floor contained two commodious apartments, the one inhabited by Candor, the other by Clara. Above it were two little rooms occupied by Germain, and the remainder &s;upplied the place of a granary, where grains and pul&s;es were drying in &s;ummer, to be the family provi&s;ion in the winter. The apartments contained no other furniture than a bed, a table, and &s;ome chairs.&mdash;In that belong|ing to Clara, &s;tood a very fine harp&s;ichord, on which &s;he had learned to play, as we &s;hall find hereafter, and which diverted her lei&s;ure, and &s;erved to di&s;&s;ipate Candor's melancholy thoughts.</P>
<P>On the left hand, in the yard, was a &s;table for their hor&s;e, and a large box containing all the implements required for hu&s;bandry and gardening: On the right, rain water was let in from the fo&s;&s;e into a pond, which &s;upplied the drink of our hermits, after they had clarified it.</P>
<P>Behind the building, all within the enclo&s;ure was a kitchen garden, cultivated by Germain and Clara, in which they &s;owed all kinds of vegetables and other garden &s;tuff, which they purcha&s;ed at St. Marcellin. They had plenty of peas, beans, potatoes, &amp;c. which was provi&s;ion for them all the year round, for they eat no other meat than fowls, which they had in plenty in their little yard, &s;ituated towards the left wing of the building. The&s;e particulars &s;hew us that they did not want for nece&s;&s;aries, and from the account Candor &s;hall give of his misfortunes, we &s;hall &s;ee how he could procure them. Let us now return to Alexis.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030364_0021_0FE5D159DF969BE0">
When Clara and Candor had &s;hown him the cottage, the old man made him &s;tep into a parlor, and re|que&s;ted him, previous to his a&s;&s;igning him a room, to relate the &s;tory of his infancy. "My &s;on," &s;aid he, "be true, hide nothing, nor even palliate your faults; you have undoubtedly committed &s;ome, e&s;pecially at your age; you would not el&s;e be human; I &s;hall ex|cu&s;e them if they do not &s;pring from the heart. Speak and be candid."</P>
<P>Alexis complied, and Germain, who un&s;addled the hor&s;e while they were walking round the premi&s;es, having joined them again, our young hero thus com|menced the &s;tory of his misfortunes, which will prove, e&s;pecially to fathers of families, how careful they &s;hould be in the choice of a PRECEPTOR FOR THEIR CHILDREN.</P>
<P>"I cannot tell you," began Alexis, "the place of my birth, nor my father's name, as both have always been a &s;ecret to me. As far as I am able to recollect, I was in my tender infancy, in the arms of a good old woman, whom I u&s;ed to call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but who, I was informed afterwards, was nowi&s;e related to me, yet &s;he did not tell me who were my real parents. That good woman had the care of my edu|cation till I was ten, and received punctually every month, by an unknown hand, a con&s;iderable &s;um for my board. Under her care I learned to read, to write, to ca&s;t accounts, and the fir&s;t elements of dancing and mu&s;ic, &s;tudies which I continued at college, where &s;he told me one day, &s;he had orders to conduct me; we then lived at Paris, in <HI>rus de la Cha&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>"Mrs. Delys (this was the name of my good gov|erne&s;s) was in affluent circum&s;tances; &s;he had been left a widow for upwards of &s;ixteen years, by her hu&s;band, an officer of the hor&s;e, who had bequeathed to her an annual income of two thou&s;and crowns: She had re&s;olved to &s;pend her life in a &s;olitary part of the metropolis, far from company, which had become baleful to her, &s;ince the death of a beloved &s;on, who fell in a duel, by the hands of a friend, in con&s;equence of a quarrel. Though ten years had elap&s;ed &s;ince his death, his mother &s;till bewailed him daily, would receive no kind of vi&s;it, and &s;pent her time in talking
<PB N="20" REF="030364_0022_0FE5D16342EA3B28">
to me about the virtues of her poor Delys, the treachery of his friend, and the fal&s;ity of men. Thus &s;he talked to me, a child incapable of under&s;tanding, and &s;till le&s;s of comforting her. How &s;he would weep! I wept with her without knowing why, and we mingled our tears. You &s;ee that the fir&s;t dawn of my life &s;pent in &s;adne&s;s, has not a little contribued to give me a gloomy, fretful, and anxious di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>"I a&s;ked her many times with regard to my parents, and blamed her for her ob&s;tinacy in concealing them from me; her an&s;wer was that &s;he her&s;elf did not know them; that &s;he educated me to oblige her hu&s;|band's brother, who knew them, and kept it a &s;ecret; that all &s;he knew was, that I ought to look upon my exi&s;tence as fatality, and that the hi&s;tory of my birth, &s;hould it ever come to my knowledge, would in&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e me with horror, and make me wretched for life. To be &s;ure, all this was not very plea&s;ing; on the other hand, Mrs. Delys &s;poke with &s;uch warmth on the &s;ubject, that I might well &s;uppo&s;e I was related to her.</P>
<P>"I never went any where but to church. Thither I was always conveyed in a carriage, the gla&s;&s;es of which Mrs. Delys took great care to &s;hut every time. In a word, being &s;o much hidden from the world, and &s;hut up as it were in a box, that nobody &s;hould &s;ee me, I conceived the whole in an ominous light, and accord|ing to my little way of arguing, I could fore&s;ee nothing but fatality on account of &s;uch a conduct.</P>
<P>"One day, Mrs. Delys took me privately into her apartment, telling me, with tears in her eyes, "My dear friend, you are to leave me! we mu&s;t part, my &s;weet child."&mdash;"Mu&s;t we part, madam?"&mdash;"You cry, you are &s;orry to part, &s;o am I; but it mu&s;t be: But I am not &s;ufficient to complete your education.

Mr. Dumont, as abb&eacute; of a re&s;pectable character, is cho&s;en by your parents to have you under his care; he is to live with you; in a word, con&s;ider him as your preceptor, but as a faithful friend; make him your confidant; he is, I believe, a worthy man."</P>
<P>"I remained motionle&s;s at this di&s;cour&s;e, and when Mrs. Delys had done, I let flow my tears, in freedom; I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and &s;olicited to remain with her, when my new mentor entered, and by his appearance, chilled me with terror.</P>
<P>"Mr. Dumont was about forty, tall, &s;lender, and lean; but his countenance, which bore the &s;tamp of brobity and frankne&s;s, di&s;pelled my fear, and made me approach him by degrees.</P>
<P>"This, &s;ir, is he," &s;aid Mrs. Delys, "the poor child! you &s;ee how he regrets me!"&mdash;"That he ought, madam," an&s;wered Mr. Dumont, politely, "but will you not &s;ometimes come and &s;ee him?"&mdash;Oh! very often."&mdash;"Well, you &s;hould both &s;eek comfort in rea|&s;on; come, my little friend, come with me: I frighten you, don't I? You may &s;ay &s;o freely, but be a&s;&s;ured, there is nothing di&s;mal about me, but my dre&s;s; you in&s;pire me with too much concern that I &s;hould not love you; I will be your friend, and believe me, &s;hould you unfortunately be kept from your father, you will find a father in me."</P>
<P>This &s;peech &s;omewhat allayed my terrors: I &s;tam|mered &s;ome thanks, and having once more thrown my&s;elf into Mrs. Delys's arms, I followed Mr. Dumont who affectionately laid hold of my hand, &s;queezed it, and conducted me to the carriage. A &s;ervant whom I had never &s;een, put up and fa&s;tened my trunk on behind, and my tutor gave me to under&s;tand that the &s;ame man was to wait upon us at college.</P>
<P>The coachman drove fa&s;t, and &s;et us down at the college of Navarre, a porter came to open the gate and &s;hut in immediately after us. It was then I felt my heart beat, my knees tottered, and I felt indi&s;po&s;ed. The abb&eacute; and my &s;ervant carried me to the ma&s;ter's

apartment, where I recovered, and &s;aw my&s;elf &s;ur|rounded by pedants in black gowns, who with a &s;uper|cilious mein, and declamatory voice, &s;aid among them&s;elves&mdash;"This is the way of all the children; how idlene&s;s and indolence work them; and then, you &s;ee, they are &s;poiled by their parents at home, but that will not do here; the <HI>ferula</HI> mu&s;t cure them&mdash;Well, my little ma&s;ter, are you better now? Never mind, never mind. Today he &s;hall have a holiday; he &s;hall not &s;tudy; is not that very pretty? But tomorrow he mu&s;t go to books, and &s;how him&s;elf very docile, very &s;tudious; won't you, my little man?"</P>
<P>"I made no an&s;wer; this black tribe almo&s;t fright|ened me out of my wits, and but for Mr. Dumont, who &s;eemed le&s;s ill natured than the&s;e, I think I &s;hould have run away. I came thither like a lamb conducted to the &s;laughter hou&s;e, without knowing what was wanted of me, I let them talk and prepared my&s;elf for all events.</P>
<P>My preceptor &s;taid for a few minutes with the ma&s;ter, in another apartment, and I was left alone trembling before three abb&eacute;s, who a&s;ked me &s;everal que&s;tions, which I did not an&s;wer. Soon they ro&s;e, and mutter|ing among them&s;elves, I heard them &s;ay, "What a blockhead of a boy! Nay, he's ba&s;hful. Ba&s;hful, no, it is &s;tupidity: He will give us &s;ome trouble! But we will manage him," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont &s;hortly after returned to the apartment, and the ma&s;ter conducted us to a &s;pacious room, which he &s;aid was to be ours; he then retired, patting me upon the cheek, and commanding me to be a <HI>very good boy.</HI> I had longed to &s;ee him gone, in order to give vent to my &s;orrow; Mr. Dumont con&s;oled me; dinner was &s;erved, but I could not eat, and remained &s;ad all day long.</P>
<P>Next morning Mr. Dumont put a Rudiments into my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and, informed me that I was to be received into a cla&s;s. I performed what he bid me, although I did not well under&s;tand what he &s;aid. At one o'clock Mrs. Delys came to &s;ee me, exhorting me to a&s;&s;ume that firmne&s;s which my new way of life would exact. Her appearance recalled my &s;orrow, but at la&s;t &s;he left me, and I took a re&s;olution to be &s;teady.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="030364_0025_0FE5D248256885D8">
"I began to accu&s;tom my&s;elf to Mr. Dumont's com|pany; he was, in other re&s;pects, gloomy and &s;erious, and his temper bore the &s;tricte&s;t conformity to mine. I a&s;ked him one day if he knew my father, and if it was he who had placed me under his care? He an&s;wered me with all the frankne&s;s which I had many opportu|nities to remark in him afterwards, that he was entirely ignorant of my parents; that a man, &s;uppo&s;ed about thirty-five years old, who he &s;aw frequently at the hou&s;e of a lady of his acquaintance, and who &s;eemed to entertain the livelie&s;t concern for me, had a&s;ked him whether he would undertake the education of the &s;on of a friend of his, and having been an&s;wered in the affirmative, he, Mr. Dumont, had been directed by the &s;tranger to the college of Navarre, and received the &s;um of twenty-five <HI>louis,</HI> with an a&s;&s;urance that the expen&s;es of board, &amp;c. &s;hould be punctually paid.&mdash;"Be it as it will," added Mr. Dumont, "I am much induced to believe that man to be your father, becau&s;e you are a perfect likene&s;s of him."&mdash;I begged him to a&s;k of that lady, the fir&s;t time he &s;hould &s;ee her again, the name and quality of the per&s;on whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be my father. He promi&s;ed to comply with my reque&s;t, but unfortunately that woman, who alone could give us information, &s;et out that very day for a long journey, from which it appears &s;he is not yet returned, for I never heard of her afterwards.</P>
<P>"In a little time I made amazing progre&s;s under &s;o worthy a preceptor, who found out the way to gain my entire confidence; but what ingratiated him mo&s;t with me, was the conver&s;ation we had frequently together on &s;ubjects of morality. It is to him I owe the faculty of thinking, reflecting, and rea&s;oning. How valuable were his le&s;&s;ons! I &s;hall remember them forever.</P>
<P>"Men had &s;o much deceived him that he placed no tru&s;t in them, and he gave me on that head the mo&s;t whole&s;ome advice, which I have &s;ince learned to put in practice.&mdash;Thus would he argue, pray be attentive and I have no doubt but you will agree with me, that he was not mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>"There is no medium," he would &s;ay, "in &s;ociety. You mu&s;t deceive; you mu&s;t <HI>be</HI> deceived, or cringe. To dazzle others, to give one's &s;elf titles, e&s;tates,

<P>"You mu&s;t <HI>be deceived,</HI> when li&s;tening to the big talk of tho&s;e who have done all, &s;een all, and are capable of all! You are allured by the bark, without examining whether the heart of the tree is not worm-eaten. You confide in them, you open your heart to them: They abu&s;e your confidence on purpo&s;e to undo you, on purpo&s;e to draw you into their &s;nares, from which you will frequently have to extricate your&s;elf at the expen&s;e of your honor, your fortune, and your health.</P>
<P>"You find your&s;elf obliged to cringe, when not being the dupe of the &s;otti&s;h pride of &s;ome, and the vices of others, you conform to a certain degree with their manner of living. It is then you create your&s;elf a &s;y&s;tem of your own, when you regulate your conduct, and adopt &s;weet and polite manners, and cea&s;e to be their confidant. It is then people will ob&s;erve you, for your wit, your abilities, or your fortune, and will &s;ay, Mr. &s;uch-a one is no doubt amiable, but he is a poor &s;oul, that has no energy, no pa&s;&s;ions; it is a good thing, you may make of him what you plea&s;e, el&s;e he would be in&s;ufferable in &s;pite of all his probity.</P>
<P>"Nece&s;&s;ity, pride, or indolence alone make the world cultivate your friend&s;hip. Are you above it? It will flatter you. Are you beneath it? It will <HI>protect</HI> you, as we call it. All you can expect from it is meanne&s;s and humiliation. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of treachery, &s;landers, calumny, things which make havoc in &s;ociety. You mu&s;t expect them, as &s;oon as you &s;et out in the world. What intere&s;t, therefore, can make you de&s;ire it? None. The inference is plain&mdash;fly from it."</P>
<P>"Thus &s;poke Mr. Dumont, and his principles became engraven on my mind with indelible force. Fond of &s;olitude, and without acquaintance, we never went out. On holidays only we took a walk in the fields, for he
<PB N="25" REF="030364_0027_0FE5D16CD849AE90">
did not like tho&s;e gaudy places of re&s;ort, where luxury parades in idle expence, and attracts the vain admira|tion of &s;ome, and the fooli&s;h de&s;ires others. We always took a book with us, a book of morality, of the very &s;erious, of the very <HI>&s;ombre</HI> kind, which we got by heart, and often &s;pent whole hours in reflecting and commenting upon a &s;ingle phra&s;e.</P>
<P>"How plea&s;ing were tho&s;e rural excur&s;ions! Happy times!

We were charmed&mdash;though we &s;ighed&mdash;with the happy quiet ari&s;ing from the &s;implicity and innocence of our plea&s;ures.</P>

<P>ALEXIS CONTINUES HIS ADVENTURES.&mdash;CHARACTER OF DUMONT.&mdash;ALEXIS FINDS HIS FATHER.&mdash;AN INTERVIEW.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE MAN IN A MASK.</HEAD>
<P>BY this time I had been three months at the college of Navarre, and received no other vi&s;it than that of Mrs. Delys, who came to &s;ee us &s;ometimes. She became very intimate with Mr. Dumont, and we made a mutual exchange of books, which were our only plea&s;ure. Uncertein if I &s;hould ever di&s;cover my parents, I armed my&s;elf with patience, and was con|tented with my lot, when one day my man Vincent informed Mr. Dumont, that a gentleman in an elegant carriage had ju&s;t alighted, and wi&s;hed to &s;peak to him in private. My preceptor goes to meet him&mdash;both
<PB N="26" REF="030364_0028_0FE5D16DA5D95C90">
enter another apartment, and wait together about an hour. So long an interview began to make me unea&s;y, but Mr. Dumont joined me, and &s;aid in a whi&s;per, with great appearance of joy, "This is the per&s;on who in|tru&s;ted me with your education, and whom I &s;uppo&s;e to be your father. He was ju&s;t given me fifty more louis d'ors for your &s;econd quarter, and de&s;ires you to take a dancing, a drawing, and mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter. Oh! he will bring you up a little prince!"</P>
<P>"Ah, &s;ir," interrupted I, "cannot I &s;ee him?"&mdash;"This is what I a&s;ked," an&s;wered he, "but he much objected again&s;t that favor; at la&s;t he complied, on condition of his putting on a ma&s;k before he enters: No doubt he does it to hide that &s;triking re&s;emblance, which, as I have already ob&s;erved, there is between you."</P>
<P>"Oh!" cried I, "let him appear as he likes&mdash;let me but &s;ee him! Let me bathe his feet with my tears."</P>
<P>"Stop, &s;top," &s;aid Dumont, "be moderate, and &s;ave appearances."</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont left me, and returned a moment after with the &s;tranger, who had actually ma&s;ked his face.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t grant, my amiable friends, that I was much di&s;concerted at &s;uch a moment. What counte|nance could I keep! No doubt I was to wait till he &s;hould &s;peak to me fir&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, I could hardly forbear throwing my&s;elf into his arms&mdash;and you &s;hall hear the whole account of a &s;cene &s;o intere&s;ting to me, and which, as long as I live, &s;hall be engraved on my memory. I &s;aluted the unknown per&s;on with re&s;pect, and he beckoned me to be &s;eated. Vincent gave us chairs, and left the apartment, I perceived that the man in a ma&s;k was tottering, and agitated by a trouble, which it was in vain for him to conceal. At la&s;t he &s;at down, and began to examine me; I could collect from the heaving of his brea&s;t that his heart was beating, and that he could &s;carcely fetch breath. All the&s;e tokens &s;erved to confirm my doubts, but, far more trembling and moved than he, I dared not to look at him, or make the &s;malle&s;t ge&s;ture. This dumb &s;cene had la&s;ted long, when Mr. Dumont, &s;en&s;ible that it affected us too much, ha&s;tened to interrupt it with addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="030364_0029_0FE5D16EF7C5C948">
"Alexis," &s;aid he, "this is the gentleman who is &s;o good as to &s;upply your wants, and to have you educated."&mdash;"Ah! &s;ir, how kind in you."&mdash;"De&s;erve it by your docility and a clo&s;e attention to Mr. Dumont's le&s;&s;ons."&mdash;"Yes, &s;ir, nothing could have been a more convincing proof of the kindne&s;s of my <HI>parents</HI> than a choice of &s;o worthy a preceptor,'&mdash;"Who told you," &s;aid the &s;tranger, "that Mr. Dumont has been cho&s;en by your parents!"&mdash;"Why, &s;ir, have I no parents?"&mdash;"Unfortunate boy! maye&s;t thou never know them!"&mdash;"O heaven! you know them well, you know them, &s;ir?"&mdash;"No que&s;tions, if you plea&s;e."&mdash;"Ah! &s;hould you &s;ee my father, tell him&mdash;tell him that his little Alexis cannot live without embracing him, without falling at his feet! he &s;eeks him through nature ever &s;ince he was born; he calls aloud to him; he &s;crutinizes every eye, every face&mdash;but, alas! nobody has heard his cries."&mdash;"unrea&s;onable boy! what woulde&s;t thou have?"&mdash;"I'll &s;ee my father! I'll pre&s;s him to my heart!"&mdash;"He cannot &s;how him&s;elf to you, he cannot indeed!"&mdash;"Is he, then, barbarous, hard-hearted, inflexible? Ah, does not the voice of nature appeal to his paternal brea&s;t? He is obliged to &s;tifle her voice; nay, can he who loves &s;o well do it?"&mdash;"You move me!"&mdash;"You &s;hed tears; ah, let me &s;ee them from your re&s;pectable face. Throw away, pray throw away this deceitful ma&s;k; it does not become the man of feeling; &s;ir, here I lie at your feet; in pity no longer conceal my father; I conjure you by your own, if he yet be living; I can &s;ee your perplexity! Well, if you love <HI>him,</HI> if <HI>he</HI> is dear to you, you cannot reprove my filial emotions! Alas, behold my tears, they fall; they overflow your hand! you pu&s;h my hand away; cruel, &s;ir, what have I done to you? O my God! all for&s;ake me: Ah, all for&s;ake me!"</P>
<P>Here I dropt upon the floor in an agony of grief. Mr. Dumont, moved by my appearance, exhorted and entreated the &s;tranger to put an end to my &s;uffer|ings, whil&s;t the latter, who, with the livelie&s;t emotions, was &s;truggling, &s;obbing, and looking at me, li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ted up his hands to heaven, and exclaimed, in a piercing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">one, "Oh!

<P><PB N="28" REF="030364_0030_0FE5D1705DE9BAE8">
"But he relap&s;ed again into &s;ilence, and when I &s;aw that nothing could move him, I became furious; in a moment my eyes were dry, and with a noble firmne&s;s I made an effort to triumph over my&s;elf. In a tone of re&s;pect and a&s;&s;urance, I &s;aid&mdash;"Well, &s;ir, I &s;ee you are fully bent on my de&s;pair. I know what re&s;olution is left for me. Since I have no parents who love me, I have nothing to tie me to nature. What &s;hould I do? what fate awaits me? Shame, misfortune, and igno|miny. But I am re&s;olved to die, and rid my family of a burden, which I am &s;orry to &s;ee they find too heavy for them. Farewel, &s;ir, farewel Dumont, an everla&s;ting farewel.</P>
<P>"Whither would you?" cried the &s;tranger, holding out his hand to me, "Do you know that your death would cau&s;e the death of your father?&mdash;"Ah! it <HI>is</HI> you," I exclaimed, throwing my&s;elf into his arms. "What does he &s;ay?"&mdash;"It is you, yes, it is you, I am &s;ure: Nature hath &s;poke, you <HI>are</HI> my father."&mdash;"Leave me, <HI>my &s;on</HI>&mdash;O! how could I utter this word?"&mdash;<HI>"My &s;on!</HI> Welcome, charming name, that for the fir&s;t time &s;alutes my ears, how &s;weet art thou to my heart!"</P>
<P>Here my father took off his ma&s;k, pre&s;enting to me a noble, intere&s;ting countenance, overflowing with tears. He takes me into his arms, pre&s;&s;es his ardent lips to mine, and retains me in his embrace for &s;ome minutes. Sweet pre&s;&s;ure of paternal tenderne&s;s! I had never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elt you before! how dear were the&s;e embraces! I wept, laughed, and committed a thou&s;and extrava|gances, and we were all three like di&s;tracted per&s;ons. I &s;ay all three, for Mr. Dumont, whom this &s;cene had moved to tears, who &s;hared our &s;adne&s;s, now &s;hared out joy; in a word, we were in a manner electrified at the &s;ame in&s;tant by various &s;entiments, which glided through our frame with the greate&s;t rapidity.</P>
<P>After my father had given vent to his &s;en&s;ibility, he made us again &s;it down, and addre&s;&s;ed me thus: "My &s;on, I have had the &s;tronge&s;t motives to remain un|known to you, and &s;till pre&s;erve them. You have ju&s;t torn from me a &s;ecret which ought to have died with me. But I &s;hall not repent if you promi&s;e to obey the laws I am now to pre&s;cribe to you. In the fir&s;t place,

I forbid you to a&s;k me the lea&s;t que&s;tion re&s;pecting my name and quality.

In the &s;econd place, I forbid you to follow me, or expre&s;s the &s;malle&s;t curio&s;ity to know me farther. Should I find you guilty of this. I &s;hall abandon and never &s;ee you again. The&s;e laws a&s;toni&s;h you, I can believe; but I am compelled to pre&s;cribe them. Alas! you have made my life the &s;ummit of human wretchedne&s;s.

You are an hone&s;t man: I am &s;ure of it. The per&s;on at who&s;e hou&s;e I became acquainted with you has given me an account of your misfortunes. They do you credit. Adieu, my &s;on; be a&s;&s;ured that I &s;hall never for&s;ake you, and &s;hall ever watch over you and your education."</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont and I gazed on this a&s;toni&s;hing man, who laid upon us &s;uch &s;ingular injunctions; and, un|acquainted with his misfortunes which in&s;pired us with the mo&s;t lively concern, we judged them to be of the mo&s;t afflicting kind, as he had deprived him&s;elf &s;o long of the &s;ight of a &s;on, who &s;eemed to engro&s;s his tender|ne&s;s, and to whom, even when care&s;&s;ing him, he dared not to reveal either his name or his rank.</P>
<P>At length he ro&s;e to leave us, and after be&s;towing upon me fre&s;h care&s;&s;es and tokens of tenderne&s;s, he pulled out of his fob a mo&s;t valuable watch, ornament|ed with diamonds; "Here," &s;aid he, "my Alexis, let this put you in mind of our fir&s;t interview,"&mdash;"O heaven! what do you propo&s;e? I do not want &s;o rich a gift."&mdash;"Take it, I &s;ay, think on me <HI>when the clock &s;trikes ten!"</HI>&mdash;"What do you mean?"&mdash;"Tremble to hear one day the explanation of this my&s;tery."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he left us, &s;truck dumb with this &s;econd <HI>trait</HI> of his character; but at la&s;t the plea&s;ure
<PB N="30" REF="030364_0032_0FE5D1754A748380">
of having found my father made me forget every thing el&s;e, and I only wi&s;hed to prove my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him, by making rapid advances in the path of knowledge under the au&s;pices of Mr. Dumont. It was lucky Vincent had not &s;een this &s;cene; we were re&s;olved to conceal it from him, to prevent his making &s;uch in|quiries to know my father, as we would not have attempted our&s;elves, &s;o much did we wi&s;h to comply with the orders he had given me.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont was not mi&s;taken in having been told that I was &s;o much like my father: I was indeed his very portrait, and upon recollection, I remember to have &s;een him many times next me when I went to church with Mrs. Delys. There being always a great number of people in our &s;eat, I took no particular notice of him, though undoubtedly he came there on purpo&s;e to &s;ee me. Mrs. Delys did not, or feigned not to know him, for I never &s;aw her &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>The notion he had to enter my apartment in a ma&s;k was not very fit to remove all &s;u&s;picions from my mind; for &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;cene had not terminated as it did, it is plain I would have a&s;ked him why he appeared before me in di&s;gui&s;e. Perhaps he then would have been much at a lo&s;s for an an&s;wer; but in my confu&s;ion I did not think of it.</P>
<P>The valuable jewel which I had received from my father, as a pre&s;ent, was &s;o fine, &s;o new to me, that I &s;pent the whole day in examining and making my <HI>repeater</HI> &s;ound; Mr. Dumont all the while chiding me for my puerile conduct, though he could not help admiring the &s;ize and brilliance of the diamonds, which were very large. This confirmed us more and more in the idea that my father was a great lord. When I opened the ca&s;e to examine the work, we were much &s;urpri&s;ed to find the&s;e words on the back plate&mdash;THE GIFT OF LOVE, A. D. 1730. But what encrea&s;ed our a&s;toni&s;hment was, to &s;ee that the words had been &s;cratched out on purpo&s;e, &s;o that it was rather difficult to read them. I did not know what to make of it then, but Mr. Dumout drew &s;ome very probable inferences from it, which may probably occur to your minds, if you are plea&s;ed to reflect.</P>

Winding up my watch at night, I ob&s;erved in <HI>was ten.</HI> That very moment my father's words returned to my mind; <HI>Think on me when the clock &s;trikes ten!</HI> I felt a cold &s;weat all over my body; my heart was depre&s;&s;ed, I knew not why; I went to bed, my eyes &s;wimming in tears. During the night, I was tormented by ominous dreams. I &s;aw my father pierced with &s;tabs, &s;tretching out his hand to me, &amp;c. All the&s;e phantoms, the crea|tures of the &s;u&s;picions I entertained when I went to bed, vani&s;hed when I awoke. I informed my tutor of them, who railed at my credulity, and wholly di&s;&s;ipated my terrors. Neverthele&s;s, every night when I wound up my watch, if unluckily I perceived the <HI>hour of ten,</HI> I felt an involuntary emotion which I could not account for. The&s;e my&s;terious expre&s;&s;ions of my father had indeed &s;ome meaning. The manner in which he dwelt upon them when he uttered them, his tone of voice, in &s;hort, every thing proved it; but I never could comprehend their meaning, and am &s;till ignorant of it. Perhaps one day if I am able to unravel my adventures. I may comprehend them and the misfor|tune I have to dread.</P>
<P>In compliance with my father's de&s;ire, next day I hired proper ma&s;ters to teach me drawing, mu&s;ic, and dancing, and cultivated the&s;e arts, I may &s;ay, with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Three months elap&s;ed before my father returned to &s;ee me. What joy did I feel when Mr. Dumont brought me the news! I flew to meet him, and pre&s;&s;ed him in my arms. He embraced me clo&s;ely, called me his dear, his little Alexis; then made me repeat the le&s;&s;ons I had received &s;ince his ab&s;ence, and was charmed with my progre&s;s. Every moment he would &s;ay&mdash;<HI>He will re&s;emble his mother, he will inherit all her accompli&s;hments.</HI> I had too much re&s;pect to a&s;k him any que&s;tions about his &s;ecret, que&s;tions which might have grieved him, and I &s;aw with plea&s;ure that he judged me worthy of the care he took of my educa|tion.</P>
<P>He made another payment of fifty louis d'ors to Mr. Dumont, reque&s;ting him to entertain me with theatrical performances, to bring me into the world, and above all never to &s;peak of the &s;ecret of my birth.
<PB N="32" REF="030364_0034_0FE5D17BB1C6B8B8">
He al&s;o made me &s;everal u&s;eful and valuable pre&s;ents, for which I returned him my &s;incere&s;t thanks. He was about to leave me, when I pulled out my watch, to tell him it was not late, and per&s;uaded him to &s;tay a little longer; on this he took my hand, and &s;aid to me, in a tender voice, "My dear &s;on, you cannot think too much upon me <HI>when the clock &s;trikes ten."</HI> For this time I could hardly refrain my curio&s;ity. I was bold enough to a&s;k him, what happened to him at that hour?&mdash;"I work for thee, my dear Alexis&mdash;alas, what was I going to &s;ay?&mdash;My &s;on, I once begged of you&mdash;Let this be your la&s;t que&s;tion."</P>
<P>I made a thou&s;and apologies for my imprudence. My good father forgave me, pre&s;&s;ed me to his heart, and promi&s;ed to come and &s;ee me again in three months' time.</P>
<P>What a &s;ingular character! Are you not &s;urpri&s;ed, my worthy friends, at &s;o extraordinary a conduct? It &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Dumont and me highly, but we were obliged to keep &s;ilence. It was enough of happine&s;s for me to &s;ee my father, and receive his tender care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Five years elap&s;ed, during which I made con&s;idera|ble improvement in my cla&s;&s;ics, and in the fine arts. My father came regularly to the college every three months, and always left us money and pre&s;ents; being him&s;elf an excellent &s;cholar, he &s;ometimes would con|de&s;cend to examine me upon the &s;ciences, and &s;eemed always charmed with my an&s;wers. He would then congratulate Mr. Dumo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and intreat him to per&s;evere in his zeal. He, however, never omitted exhorting him to procure me amu&s;ement, and to introduce me to the polite world: He found in me, he &s;aid, a gloomy temper, an awkward air, and little of the fine manners. My tutor promi&s;ed to do every thing, but he performed little or nothing at all. Plea&s;ures and company were quite aver&s;e to his character, and he was &s;crupulous in meddling with them. I &s;hall &s;oon relate the hi&s;tory of my &s;etting out for the circles of the fine world. I have now to impart to you an odd prediction, to which I gave no credit, though it would much a&s;toni&s;h me, were it to turn out a true one. My father had &s;o often told me to think on him <HI>when the clock &s;truck ten,</HI> that one day I was re&s;olved to
<PB N="33" REF="030364_0035_0FE5D17D12688A28">
try to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, the &s;en&s;e of this enigma.</P>
<P>There was at the college gate a poor beggar, about forty years of age, all in rags, but with a hand&s;ome face, who pa&s;&s;ed for a conjurer. All the &s;tudents had con&s;ulted him, and all had left him, &s;urpri&s;ed at his talents of divining the pa&s;t, and foretelling the future. The ma&s;ter of the college had ordered him to be driv|en away twenty times, but he always returned, and found a livelihood in the pre&s;ents made to him by the curious. While Mr. Dumont was walking one day in the yard with &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ors, I &s;eized this occa&s;ion to bring the pauper into my room. The great iron gate was open; and the porter, bu&s;y with &s;omething or other, had not &s;een him come in; every thing crowned my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Having clo&s;eted my&s;elf with him, I began to a&s;k him, "what countryman are you?"&mdash;"From Bour|gen Bre&s;&s;e."&mdash;"What bu&s;ine&s;s did you follow?"&mdash;"A very dangerous and ungrateful one, that of a &s;oldier."&mdash;"Have you &s;erved?"&mdash;"Yes, and honora|bly, my good gentleman; I have here eight wounds, which will prove it."&mdash;"And you mu&s;t now go a begging?"&mdash;"Why, it is not the man who fights for his country that grows rich; it is he that keeps it down."&mdash;"Very true."&mdash;"Don't you &s;ee that the little ones have the greate&s;t trouble, and the great earn the large&s;t benefits."&mdash;"Thou art a clever, ju|dicious fellow."&mdash;"Good &s;en&s;e is a gift of nature, and judgment the re&s;ult of experience."&mdash;"Very good! pray how did you learn to tell fortunes?"&mdash;"This is our bu&s;ine&s;s in garri&s;ons; there we find people who have been all over the world, who have &s;een all nations on earth, and one picks up in&s;truction by another."&mdash;"Well, a per&s;on dear to me, when he gave me this watch, &s;aid, and has repeated the &s;ame words &s;ince, <HI>Think on me when the clock &s;trikes ten!</HI> Could you now tell me what he does at that hour?"&mdash;"To be &s;ure, my kind gentleman; lend me this jewel."</P>
<P>"I tru&s;ted the watch into his hands. He &s;uddenly began to be pen&s;ive, to write, to make calculations, and at the expiration of one hour, with a prophetic voice, which upon any other occa&s;ion would have made me laugh, &s;aid to me, "This watch you have
<PB N="34" REF="030364_0036_0FE5D17DDCD6B0C0">
received from a man, who received it from a woman, and that man is in confinement every night at ten o'clock, in a pri&s;on, which he does not quit till next morning."</P>
<P>Though &s;imilar divinations received no great belief from me, I could not help trembling at the&s;e dreadful words; and &s;uch was my rage that I was very near ill treating the beggar, for having pronounced a &s;en|tence &s;o unwelcome to me. I compo&s;ed my&s;elf, however, and entreated him to di&s;cover how he had been able to gue&s;s that? The man, anxious to find an opportunity of making a brilliant di&s;play of his knowledge, made the following harangue:</P>
<P>"To us every thing is cabali&s;tical: A watch, a pocket book, a ring, every thing has &s;igns which are always the &s;ame, and upon which we lay various and different con&s;tructions, according to the circum&s;tances. A watch is the &s;ymbol of life. <HI>One o'clock</HI> is the in&s;tant of birth, and always implies blind|ne&s;s, &s;uffering, joy mixed with pains, in&s;en&s;ibility, ficklene&s;s, &amp;c. <HI>Two o'clock</HI> marks the age of &s;ix. It is carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, levity, caprice, contempt of the great, oblivion of troubles, and content. <HI>Three o'clock</HI> refers to the age of nine. It means thinking, troubles, tears, unea&s;ine&s;s, labor, &amp;c. I could thus explain all the hours, one after another, but I &s;hould confine my&s;elf to the &s;ign of <HI>ten o'clock,</HI> which is the age of three &s;core and three. It &s;ignifies heavine&s;s, ice, pri&s;on, fetters, &amp;c. Or, every hour has another wherewith it forms a contra&s;t. The oppo&s;ite to <HI>ten</HI> is <HI>&s;ix,</HI> which is the age of eighteen, the age when we break the bands of childhood, and where the pa&s;&s;ions appear with impetu|o&s;ity. That &s;ignifies elopement, delivery, tran&s;itory happine&s;s, lively plea&s;ure, but of &s;hort duration, and poi&s;oned by remor&s;e or the fear of futurity.</P>
<P>"From this explanation, you may collect, that had you known my &s;ecret, you would have gue&s;&s;ed this enigma as well as my&s;elf. Divide the hours into three years each, and thus proceed to midnight, which is the period, or <HI>death.</HI> Make them refer to the moral actions of every epoch of life, and you will gue&s;s all. Your man is in affliction at ten at night: I mean, he
<PB N="35" REF="030364_0037_0FE5D17EA4992BD0">
is re&s;trained, fettered, impri&s;oned: And as every cri&s;is has a period, and every hour a contra&s;t, thus he leaves his confinement at &s;ix in the morning."</P>
<P>I could not help laughing at this &s;trange fu&s;tian of my prophet, and &s;eeing me &s;o merry, he was on the point of being angry, and would give me another &s;pecimen of his abilities. He made &s;ome grimaces, examined my hands, my eyes, my features, and fini&s;hed with telling me, that I &s;hould one day become very rich, very powerful, very happy, &amp;c. that I &s;hould be married to a fine woman whom I had loved a very long time, but that all this was not to come to pa&s;s before I had undergone a great deal of adver&s;ity.&mdash;"Well, my friend," an&s;wered I, "I receive your prediction; go, and if ever I am happy, thou &s;halt be happy too."&mdash;"You think I am in joke," pur&s;ued the diviner, "but be &s;ure if I am &s;o fortunate as to di&s;cover the truth of my augury, you &s;hall &s;ee me at your door."</P>
<P>I &s;ent him away laughing, and upbraiding my&s;elf for my fooli&s;h curio&s;ity.</P>

<P>IN the mean time I grew up, and every day added &s;omething to my accompli&s;hments; but of what u&s;e were they to me? Mu&s;ic, in which I was a tolera|ble adept, far from having tho&s;e charms which every other per&s;on finds in it tired and wearied me. I had no opportunity to di&s;play it. I went to no concert, not even to a play, and was reduced to &s;ing &s;uch &s;olitary airs as Mr. Dumont cho&s;e to place before me.</P>
<P>He painted &s;ociety in &s;uch odious colours, that I was far from begging him to introduce me any where; our &s;ole amu&s;ement was to walk in the country. We always reaped &s;ome advantage from the&s;e excur&s;ions; nothing to us was an object of indifference, and we
<PB N="36" REF="030364_0038_0FE5D1802BBB30C0">
made comments upon every little incident that pre|&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>
<P>One day we returned from Belleville, by a path leading through the fields; the &s;un was &s;unk beneath the horizon, and the di&s;k of the moon proclaimed the empire of night. We perceived a young man behind a bu&s;h at &s;ome di&s;tance from our path, &s;ighing and uttering &s;uch loud complaints as reached our ears. We could plainly &s;ee him hold a pi&s;tol, which he loaded with apparent ha&s;te, and applied it repeatedly to his mouth. At fir&s;t we were apprehen&s;ive for our&s;elves, but finding that the &s;tranger did not perceive us, and was apparently &s;truggling in deep de&s;pair, we yielded to compa&s;&s;ion. We approached the hedge &s;lowly, and could hear him utter the&s;e words, in a di&s;tracted man|ner, with a low voice, interrupted with &s;ighs&mdash;"Let me fini&s;h! Let this moment terminate my &s;ufferings! I have lo&s;t my all! Death is but a &s;lumber, I will &s;leep then, and &s;uffer no more."</P>
<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions rou&s;ed the indignation of my Men|tor: He plainly &s;aw that the man was a materiali&s;t, and he dete&s;ted that impious &s;ect. Yet pity, and a de&s;ire of reclaiming him to rea&s;on, determined him to con|vince him of his error, if po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ave his life. "Ah! &s;ir, what are you doing?" cried he, di&s;cover|ing him&s;elf; can you entertain &s;o bad an opinion of your&s;elf and of the Being that made you?"</P>
<P>The &s;tranger, &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;udden apparition of a prie&s;t and a young man, was &s;truck, but compo&s;ing him&s;elf, an&s;wered Mr. Dumont&mdash;"What is my way of thinking to you? Are you, &s;ir, to an&s;wer for me? Let us be &s;hort, I have no time to di&s;pute with you, I mu&s;t get rid of my life, I mu&s;t." "What prompts you to &s;o ra&s;h a deed?"&mdash;Every thing; di&s;tre&s;s and a total want of re&s;ources."&mdash;"At your age do you de&s;pair of providence."&mdash;"Mere words."&mdash;"Very efficacious words. But what impels you to a deed &s;o unworthy of a man of courage? Your exterior &s;hows that it is not di&s;tre&s;s?"&mdash;"It is nothing el&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you."&mdash;"Young man, be calm, di&s;clo&s;e your heart. My profe&s;&s;ion &s;hall be the pledge of my di&s;cretion and probity. Relate your misfortunes."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="030364_0039_0FE5D183CCAB06D8">
"What can it avail?"&mdash;"I may, perhaps, be of &s;ome &s;ervice to you; hear me, you are unfortunate, I have been the &s;ame, and the boy whom you &s;ee here has been unfortunate, and his &s;ituation perhaps is wor&s;e than yours! Come, my dear friend, give me the pi&s;tol, and take my hand: Sit down by your two friends upon this ri&s;ing turf! I am concerned for you; how happy &s;hould I be if I could&mdash;but&mdash;this is the murdering weapon. Away with the in&s;trument of cele&s;tial wrath, I will have you to live."</P>
<P>Dumont, with this, threw away the pi&s;tol which the young man had given him, and both &s;at down on the turf: I followed them &s;hivering, and within my&s;elf taxed my preceptor with imprudence. Acquainted as I was with his mi&s;tru&s;tful di&s;po&s;ition, he now &s;urpri&s;ed me, and his humanity alone pleaded for him."</P>
<P>The &s;tranger related a &s;eries of adver&s;e incidents, which I &s;hall not recapitulate, and concluded, that having been &s;ecretary to one count D'Ereville, he had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in a di&s;graceful way through the treach|ery of a friend, and was of cour&s;e without &s;helter or re&s;ources. Mr. Dumont, quite moved at his &s;tory, con&s;oled him, made a tender of his &s;ervices, and gave him from his pur&s;e a louis d'or. The &s;tranger thanked him in the warme&s;t manner. This gratitude touched me, and I was preparing to be&s;tow the &s;ame favor upon him: But, judge my &s;urpri&s;e! At the &s;ight of the gold, which &s;eemed to dazzle his eyes, the villain turned quite pale, and in the rude&s;t manner cried, "What, do you confine your liberality to &s;o trifling a gift? Why, have you not more money? I in&s;i&s;t upon having all."&mdash;"O heavens, thou wretch!"&mdash;"I am a wretch, and capable of&mdash;this in&s;tant give me what you have, or your life!"</P>
<P>Fear, &s;urpri&s;e, and indignation overwhelmed our &s;en&s;es. We ro&s;e and looked around, if any per&s;on could a&s;&s;i&s;t us; but the darkne&s;s of the place prevented our &s;eeing any thing, and we were defencele&s;s. The wretch produced another pi&s;tol, which he had no doubt provided for the purpo&s;e. What a &s;ituation was ours! After having loaded him with reproaches we con&s;ented to give him our all, but the ruffian &s;eeing our watch
<PB N="38" REF="030364_0040_0FE5D18635106578">
chains demanded them al&s;o. Mine was too dear for me to con&s;ent to lo&s;e it. This enraged me, I pulled out my knife, and &s;tepping backwards, "Traitor!" cried I, "thou &s;halt not have it, without my life." Mr. Dumont, encouraged by my behaviour, ru&s;hed upon the robber, wre&s;ted from his hands the pi&s;tol with which he threatened to blow out my brains. But I know not how the matter would have ended, but for the unforeseen a&s;&s;i&s;tance which heaven &s;ent us in that extremity. A waggoner's whip, and the di&s;tant rat|tling of a carriage &s;uddenly &s;truck our ears. This, which revived hope in our brea&s;ts, gave &s;uch terror and di&s;may to our enemy, that he flew from us acro&s;s the plain, and thus delivered us from the danger we were in.</P>
<P>We now looked at one another for &s;ome time unable to utter a word; and in this &s;ituation the waggoner found us. He looked at us, and, frightened at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of the pi&s;tol which Mr. Dumont &s;till held in his hand, a&s;ked us what we were doing? "Ah, my friend," cried my tutor, "to you we owe our lives; a wretch had ju&s;t robbed us; I was &s;trong enough to attack him and he made off on your approach." The waggoner a&s;ked for the pi&s;tol, and endeavored to fire it in the air, but to the &s;urpri&s;e of us all it was <HI>not</HI> loaded. We then told him our adventure, and entreated his company and protection until we &s;hould reach the <HI>porte St. Antoine.</HI> This he readily complied with, and we &s;et out together, but not without a mixture of unea&s;ine&s;s; for we were &s;o di&s;concerted by the treachery of the &s;tranger, as every now and then to look around us, believing him at our heels.</P>
<P>Having reached the <HI>port St. Antoine,</HI> we had it not in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur power to reward our guide as we could have wi&s;hed, having now not a farthing le&s;t. Mr. Dumont gave him our addre&s;s, and de&s;ired him to come and &s;ee us next day; but whether from mode&s;ty or di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, he never came, nor did we over afterwards hear of him.</P>
<P>When arrived at the college, Dumont &s;aid, "What a le&s;&s;on! what a &s;ad le&s;&s;on, my dear di&s;ciple! Such are men! Such are tho&s;e traitors, tho&s;e mon&s;ters of in|gratitude; they plunge a dagger in your brea&s;t the very moment you give them a&s;&s;i&s;tance. After &s;uch conduct,
<PB N="39" REF="030364_0041_0FE5D1870C0D7EB8">
oblige them! be humane, feeling, generous! You &s;ee how they acknowledge our kindne&s;s!"&mdash;"But, &s;ir, are they all of that di&s;po&s;ition"&mdash;"All, my dear youth; they do not po&s;itively attack you, pi&s;tol in hand, as this ruffian has done, but they will &s;lander you, they will a&s;per&s;e your character, and defame you privately. One will without pity a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate you in one &s;en&s;e. This has no principle, no character, and of cour&s;e no grati|tude. That is all warmth, all zeal, all heart: But by due inference, he has pa&s;&s;ions which will break the tie that unites them to you.</P>
<P>"There are &s;ome who love you &s;incerely, who profe&s;s a real attachment to your intere&s;t; with your friends they are your friends, but with your enemies they will act as enemies. In company with the latter, they, by a motive of zeal will defend you, but they gradually yield, and at length grant all that your enemies have to &s;ay again&s;t you.</P>
<P>"Such is the return for obligations conferred. I am, however, of opinion, that the generous heart &s;hould not be di&s;mayed, if it meets with ingratitude; and &s;hould make an effort of noble per&s;everance, and be an its guard. As for my own part I ought not to have confided in the traitor who has thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deceived us. The fir&s;t words I heard him utter were bla&s;phe|mous. I ought to have fore&s;een his villainy, for men without religion are not &s;u&s;ceptible of virtuous &s;enti|ments."&mdash;"The pi&s;tol with which he threatened us was, however, not loaded: He &s;urely mu&s;t have known that; it mu&s;t have been the &s;ight of our gold alone that made him break through all bounds,"</P>
<P>"This is another fatal vice: The &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ion hatched in an abject, indelicate heart."&mdash;"But, &s;ir, extreme want? may it not &s;ometimes&mdash;"&mdash;"Ex|treme want! No, my dear friend, never. An hone&s;t man &s;uffers, &s;ighs, and is &s;atisfied with the ca&s;ual relief afforded by humanity and genero&s;ity. We may al&s;o &s;peak of &s;ociety in regard to this vice. Be you ever &s;o rich, ever &s;o liberal to the indigent who &s;urround you they are never &s;atisfied. They will have you to &s;trip your&s;elf to &s;erve them, or at lea&s;t wi&s;h to be your equal. Covetou&s;ne&s;s, ambition and avarice prey upon them; they become in&s;atiable by fre&s;h favors confer|red.
<PB N="40" REF="030364_0042_0FE5D18EF53450C8">
You can &s;carcely expect from them the lea&s;t gratitude."</P>
<P>All the advice given me by Mr. Dumont, was, like this, wi&s;e and tempered by reflection. It crept into my mind and &s;trengthened my re&s;olution of &s;hunning all mankind, whom I con&s;idered in the wor&s;t po&s;&s;ible light.</P>
<P>Here Alexis &s;u&s;pended his narrative in order to partake of the nouri&s;hment &s;o much wanted by the three travellers. Clara &s;erved up &s;ome boiled vegeta|bles, fruit, and a little milk, and the four &s;at down to a meal which health and appetite rendered exqui&s;ite. When the meal was over Candor begged his young gue&s;t to proceed with his &s;tory, which &s;eemed great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y to intere&s;t him. They all re&s;umed their former places, and Alexis, after &s;ignifying that his adventures were drawing to a conclu&s;ion, continued with &s;uch a grace and winning addre&s;s, as totally conquered the hearts of tho&s;e who made him &s;o kindly welcome.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont conceived a project which he commu|nicated to me. He was determined to obtain every particular re&s;pecting the character of the man who frightened us in the plains of Belleville; and his end for doing it, he &s;aid, was to illu&s;trate the better by exam|ple the moral le&s;&s;ons he had given me.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger, in relating his hi&s;tory, had di&s;covered that he had been formerly &s;ecretary to count Ereville. This count had then his &s;on at college, and of all my fellow &s;tudents, the young count was the only one with whom I was intimate. I remarked in him no e&s;&s;en|tial qualities, but he appeared le&s;s degenerate than the re&s;t. As I was a proficient in mu&s;ic, he had repeat|edly invited me to his father's hou&s;e to hear his &s;i&s;ter, who, he &s;aid, was a capital performer on the piano forte. Mr. Dumont, feeling aver&s;e to my going into company, had always rejected the polite offer of my young friend, but curious to dive into our adventure at Belleville, he finally yielded to young Ereville's &s;oli|citations, and we engaged our&s;elves for the fir&s;t holiday: I took with me &s;ome pieces of mu&s;ic, and with Mr. Dumont &s;et out from the college.</P>
<P>It was about four o'clock when we arrived at the count's hou&s;e. The &s;ervant gave in our names, and
<PB N="41" REF="030364_0043_0FE5D19019C3FE38">
introduced us to a hall &s;umptuou&s;ly furni&s;hed, where, in a circle of eight or ten cavaliers, we found it dif|ficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. The young count, however, pre&s;ented us to his father and mother, and the reception they gave us was certain|ly flattering. Soon after my friend having informed them that I was a performer, they expre&s;&s;ed a cu|rio&s;ity to hear me. I objected for &s;ome time, and beg|ged Mi&s;s D'Ereville to give us a di&s;play of her tal|ents, but as &s;he refu&s;ed I was obliged to comply. I &s;at down and &s;ung to my own accompaniment a kind of &s;ong, the words and mu&s;ic of which I had compo|&s;ed. At the end of my &s;ong, the whole company be|&s;towed on me &s;uch compliments as I certainly did not de&s;erve, and begged for a copy of my &s;ong, which I promi&s;ed. Mi&s;s D'Ereville, in her turn, performed, with a mo&s;t ungraceful air, a &s;onata of my ma&s;ter's compo&s;ition, which the badne&s;s of her performance could hardly make me di&s;tingui&s;h. Notwith&s;tanding, the whole company clapped their hands, feigned great rapture, and be&s;towed the mo&s;t exaggerated prai&s;e on Mi&s;s D'Ereville; the little creature received them with an air of &s;elf &s;ufficiency, always preceeding from tho&s;e vain and high notions which people conceive of their own merit.</P>
<P>The in&s;truments were now laid a&s;ide, the vi&s;itors formed a circle, and the conver&s;ation became general. "Is it not long," madame D'Ereville a&s;ked a young officer, with a mean and haughty countenance, "Is it not long &s;ince you have &s;een the chevalier D'A***?" "Long indeed," an&s;wered the officer, "I do not know what becomes of him. He for&s;akes all his friends, which is &s;hameful." "Love decoys him from the bo&s;om of friend&s;hip," replied a per&s;on who appeared the pre&s;ident of the circle. "Well," an&s;wered a lu&s;ty abb&eacute;, "has he left his <HI>fille D'Opera?"</HI> "O no!" continues an old barone&s;s, quite loaded with diamonds: "they live &s;till together,. Is it not a mo&s;t degenerate ta&s;te? He &s;hould at lea&s;t have paid his addre&s;&s;es to &s;ome woman of quality."&mdash;"By the bye," &s;ays the abb&egrave; "he is fit for the be&s;t company. "We know him better," an&s;wered the officer.&mdash;"How do you make that out?" a&s;ked
<PB N="42" REF="030364_0044_0FE5D190E8748D58">
madame D'Ereville. "How, do you <HI>not</HI> know it," "No, I don't, pray tell me."&mdash;"He is a ba&s;tard, he is, indeed, he is the &s;on of count D'A*** and a woman who&s;e name has never been known."&mdash;"What, are you &s;ure of this, abb&eacute;?"&mdash;"Very &s;ure, he imparted it in confidence to me."&mdash;"How then came he by the title of chevalier?"&mdash;O! his is a title one may ea&s;ily take." "Softly, abb&egrave;" replied the &s;parkling barone&s;s, "he is legitimated, his father took care of that."&mdash;"He &s;ays &s;o, perhaps."&mdash;"O! this is very true, I have been intimate for &s;ix months with the chevalier D'A *** and have &s;een his diploma more than once."&mdash;"Why, diplomas may be now got ea&s;ily."&mdash;I cannot believe it, pur&s;ued madame D'Ereville! "The chevalier a ba&s;|tard! how could &s;uch a man be admitted into com|pany! "Never mind that," an&s;wered the Dowager, "the ladies like him."&mdash;"To be &s;ure," an&s;wered the counte&s;s, with a malicious &s;neer, "Tho&s;e ladies that are plenty,"&mdash;"Why, he makes his choice: that is &s;omething, however."&mdash;"He does not take the love|lie&s;t."&mdash;"Oh, &s;aid the pre&s;ident, with a bitter &s;mile, "He always takes care that Plutus indemnifies him for the ill favor of nature." At this vulgar <HI>bon mot,</HI> the whole company bur&s;t into laughter. The barone&s;s only &s;eemed to be enraged, &s;he ro&s;e, &s;aluted the company, and departed. One after another left the room in the &s;ame manner, and ill natured reflec|tions were pa&s;&s;ed at the expen&s;e of every one of them.</P>
<P>We carried away from this hou&s;e ample matter for reflection, and began to philo&s;ophize as &s;oon as we reached the college.</P>
<P>"My dear di&s;ciple" &s;aid Mr. Dumont, "you have now &s;een company, and how do you like it?&mdash;"It ap|pears &s;o odious to me that I never wi&s;h to &s;ee it again." "I &s;hall forbear advi&s;ing you on that head. The example which chance has furni&s;hed you with, ought to make a &s;ufficient impre&s;&s;ion upon your mind. I &s;hall only reflect upon the conduct of the young man, who u&s;ed us &s;o perfidiou&s;ly on the road to Belville, what do you think of him?" When I gave him my opinion, he added a number of reflections on the &s;ubject, and advi&s;ed me again&s;t keeping company with young D' Ereville, of whom he had rea&s;ons now to form a very bad opinion.</P>

<P>A NOTE THE PRESAGE OF TROUBLE.&mdash;ALEXIS QUITS THE COLLEGE.&mdash;NEW SCENES.&mdash;DUMONT IMPRI|SONED&mdash;AFFECTING DISCLOSURE.&mdash;ALEXIS MEETS HIS FATHER, WHO, WITH DUMONT, LEAVES HIM.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>LUXEMBOURG GARDENS, AND THE DUNGEON.</HEAD>
<P>THUS the &s;age le&s;&s;ons of my ma&s;ter took firm root in my heart, and I, no doubt for my welfare, acquired a re&s;erved gloomy temper, which gave him the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. He conceived &s;o &s;trong an at|tachment for me, as to promi&s;e to be for life the com|panion of his dear Alexis, if irre&s;i&s;table fate &s;hould not di&s;po&s;e otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>My father came to &s;ee us regularly every three months, and let us want for nothing. Mrs. Delys died &s;everal years before: I gave tears to her memory, but at la&s;t regretted her no farther than a re&s;pectable friend, who had &s;erved me as a mother in my infancy.</P>
<P>I was as happy as man can be, and hoped to enjoy my good fortune much longer, when fate, jealous of my peaceful days, begun the &s;eries of my misfortunes, by an event who&s;e con&s;equences &s;eemed at fir&s;t le&s;s ter|rible to me, than they really proved afterwards.</P>
<P>I was fifteen, and had &s;oon to &s;tudy philo&s;ophy, when one day Mr. Dumont received a note, which, to my terror, he read to me:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Plea&s;e to come to night to the gardens of Luxem|bourg palace, and wait in the</HI> All&eacute; des Carmes, <HI>where &s;omething of a very urgent nature &s;hall be communicated to you Alone if you plea&s;e, by eight o'clock.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE><DATE>Sept. 12, 1746.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Judge of my &s;urprize! What could they want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Dumont? He had no acquaintance. Who could be the writer of the note? What could be the urgent bu&s;ine&s;s to be communicated to him? Was it my father, who&mdash;but he could come him&s;elf! What unea&s;ine&s;s! What cruel perplexity!</P>
<P>We waited with the greate&s;t impatience for the end of the day, and although the unknown per&s;on required Mr. Dumont to come by him&s;elf, I begged the latter to permit me to accompany him, promi&s;ing, to walk
<PB N="44" REF="030364_0046_0FE5D197E3115B20">
upon the terrace during the time of their interview&punc; but he was &s;o delicate, &s;o &s;crupulous, that he could not con&s;ent to my propo&s;al. In con&s;equence, I let him depart, and waited for his return, in an agitation which I could not &s;uppre&s;s, and like a man that waits for his doom.</P>
<P>He returned about nine o'clock, and the change I perceived in his countenance made me utter a pierc|ing cry. The tears he endeavored to withhold rolled down his eyes, who&s;e redne&s;s indicated that he had &s;hed more; his voice was altered, he fixed his eyes upon me with an emotion of tenderne&s;s, was going to &s;peak, but his tongue denied its office, and he could only pre&s;s me in his arms. "Well, &s;ir," &s;aid I, "what tidings do you bring for me." "None that will vex you," an|&s;wered he, &s;triving to conceal his grief. "Be of good cheer, if I &s;hed tears, it is only becau&s;e your father is ab&s;ent, and we mu&s;t mi&s;s him for &s;ome time." "What, my father?"&mdash;"It was he; I have &s;een him! Mr. Du|mont, &s;aid he, I am obliged to go upon a very long journey&mdash;take care of my poor Alexis! I entru&s;t him to you: Re&s;tore him to me at my return. Let me find him prudent, mode&s;t, clever, and grateful! I &s;et out, I tell you, upon a journey that will la&s;t perhaps&mdash;I cannot fix the period. I &s;hall provide for you and him, but<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in&s;i&s;t upon his giving up his &s;tudies; let him quit the college of Navarre, and keep your&s;elf con|cealed in &s;ome ob&s;cure quarter of Paris, until I return. And here your father could go no farther; he gave me this large &s;um, and departed, recommending me the precious depo&s;it with which he entrusted me."</P>
<P>Thus &s;poke Mr. Dumont, and I could not perceive in his countenance that air of a&s;&s;urance &s;o peculiar to him, which was always a &s;ure token of truth. "You deceive me," &s;aid I, "my dear preceptor, you conceal my misfortune! My father abandons me forever!"&mdash;"There again, always extreme, and never confiding, a characteri&s;tic trait of yours! Why &s;hould he abandon you, have you de&s;erved it?&mdash;Alas!&mdash;Well, my Alex|is, believe a friend who &s;peaks to you, a friend who cheri&s;hes and will never &s;uffer to be parted from you&mdash;no&mdash;never!"</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030364_0047_0FE5D1995DC7EAA8">
He uttered the&s;e la&s;t words with &s;uch an emotion of &s;en&s;ibility, that I threw my&s;elf into his arms, and be|dewed his brea&s;t with my tears. I could however &s;ee, that he hid &s;omething from me, but I would impor|tune him no farther, per&s;uaded that all his views tend|ed to my happine&s;s, and it required powerful motives to make him feign.</P>
<P>The very next day we left the college, which I quitt|ed without regret, and rented an apartment in a hou&s;e near the royal botanical garden. That lodging was neither fine nor convenient; and Mr. Dumont ob&s;erv|ed that we ought to be frugal, as my father, when at a di&s;tance, would not always find &s;uch ea&s;y means to &s;end us remittances. I a&s;ked if he had promi&s;ed to write. No doubt, an&s;wered he, can a father deny him|&s;elf that comfort?</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont &s;eemed always to di&s;&s;emble, while my unea&s;ine&s;s became greater &s;till. Neverthele&s;s I kept &s;ilence, and was determined to yield to the power of fate.</P>
<P>From that very in&s;tant we changed our way of living: Vincent got his di&s;charge, and we hired a fe|male &s;ervant who was to look after our dome&s;tic con|cerns, and to dre&s;s our victuals. I al&s;o paid off and thanked my ma&s;ter; &s;o great, in &s;hort, was the change, that I firmly believed my father had abandoned me. I made often this ob&s;ervation to Mr. Dumont, who would then be angry, and always &s;hewed me certain &s;ums of money, which he &s;aid were brought him by &s;ome unknown per&s;on</P>
<P>This a whole year elap&s;ed, during which I continu|ed my &s;tudies under Mr. Dumont, who was an excel|lent &s;cholar. I begun to be a little ea&s;ier; I had the &s;ame occupation and the &s;ame plea&s;ures as before; that is to &s;ay, we took frequent wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the fields, and vi&s;ited almo&s;t daily the royal botanical garden in our neighborhood, which we &s;ound very plea&s;ant. The little wood in the centre and the mar&s;hes which en|compa&s;s the walls, reaching as far as the river, gave it &s;uch a rural and &s;olitary a&s;pect, as made it, in my opi|nion, the fine&s;t garden in Paris.</P>
<P>During the &s;econd year of our re&s;idence in the &s;ame lodgings, Mr. Dumont began to cau&s;e me a mo&s;t cruel
<PB N="46" REF="030364_0048_0FE5D19A264EDAB0">
unea&s;ine&s;s. He went out for the whole day, and only came to &s;ee me at meal hours, and at night, which time he employed to correct my exerci&s;es. He &s;till conti|nued tender and friendly, but his confidence and a&s;&s;idu|ity were much le&s;&s;ened; for my own part, I did not know where he went, as he &s;eemed to make it a my&s;|tery, I dared not to venture the lea&s;t que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I perceived that his means were very low, that our dome&s;tic par&s;imony augmented, and that our expendi|ture dimini&s;hed from day to day. I was very well dre&s;&s;ed, when his clothes were in a &s;habby condition, and he almo&s;t denied him&s;elf the common nece&s;&s;aries. I received no intelligence from my father. All this threw me into a &s;tate of langour, which brought on a very &s;erious malady, of which I had like to have died.</P>
<P>It was then I had an opportunity to &s;ee all the af|fection and attachment Mr. Dumont profe&s;&s;ed for me: He would not leave the room, for a minute, and sat up by me night and day, for the long &s;pace of three weeks, during which my illne&s;s la&s;ted. How often did I entreat him to explain him&s;elf! He always an&s;wered I was much in the wrong, for creating my&s;elf a chim|erical mi&s;ery. All affairs had taken a much better turn; in &s;hort, I was upon the point of receiving a letter from my father; his wi&s;e coun&s;els, his con&s;ola|tions, in&s;tilled, as it were, a precious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into my &s;en&s;es, and I recovered completely.</P>
<P>I was &s;carcely out of danger, but he continued his late odd way of living. He even became le&s;s &s;eden|tary, and at la&s;t I mi&s;&s;ed him for whole days together. In order to encrea&s;e my alarm, the &s;ervant maid thought to ingratiate her&s;elf with me, by informing me that my preceptor left the hou&s;e regularly every night, that as &s;oon as he &s;aw me a&s;leep he would ri&s;e, and leave the hou&s;e and not return until five in the morn|ing, and then go to bed.</P>
<P>Matters being come to &s;uch a cri&s;is, I could no long|er forbear my inquietude, and one day determined to bring him to an account for a conduct, as unnatural as irregular. Having fixed a day to make the over|ture of &s;o delicate an affair, I waited for his return, when the &s;ame &s;ervant came to me, quite frightened, and addre&s;&s;ed me in the&s;e dreadful words: "Ah!&mdash;
<PB N="47" REF="030364_0049_0FE5D19AF0F9BC28">
&s;ir!&mdash;your preceptor!&mdash;pray run after him!&mdash;he has been arre&s;ted&mdash;he is in pri&s;on!"&mdash;"Heaven! and what has he done?"&mdash;"I don't know, people &s;ay it is for debt."&mdash;"For debt! ah, my God!"</P>
<P>I ha&s;tily waited upon the commi&s;&s;aire, or ju&s;tice of the di&s;trict, and by him was informed, that the unfor|tunate Dumont had been dragged into a black dun|geon for a note of hand of <HI>five louis d'ors,</HI> which he had not been able to pay.</P>
<P>Judge of my grief at the&s;e &s;ad tidings. I went im|mediately to the pri&s;on, and reque&s;ted the jailor to open the dungeon in which my friend had been thrown, perhaps for my own &s;ake.</P>
<P>What felt I at this &s;ight! pale, bewildered, &s;tretched over a mat, with no other light than that of a &s;mall &s;piracle!&mdash;O God! I cannot retrace the picture with|out horror.</P>
<P>I flew to his arms, and we mixed our tears&mdash;"Well," &s;aid I, &s;obbing, "cruel man, I &s;ee at la&s;t the fatal &s;e|cret unravelled! We have lo&s;t all a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and you have involved your&s;elf in ruin for me!"</P>
<P>"Ah! my worthy Alexis," exclaimed he, cla&s;ping me in his arms, "I endeavored to conceal it long; but adver&s;e fate has baffled my de&s;ign. I will have you hear, and know the whole affair, but your lot is more to be pitied than mine.</P>
<P>The day I received the anonymous note, I repaired to the garden of Luxembourg, to the appointed &s;pot. I had no &s;ooner arrived, than a man, in great ha&s;te, came up to me. I knew him, it was your father; Mr. Dumont, &s;aid he, in a time of grief, it is all over!&mdash;I am forced to it&mdash;I mu&s;t abandon him." "Whom. &s;ir, that child, yoor &s;on?"&mdash;"He is not my &s;on! he cau&s;es all my misfortunes, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t amiable, and mo&s;t perfidious woman! In &s;hort, I will &s;ee him no more, neither ought, nor can I! My dear Mr. Du|mont, I know you are his friend, make him take the re&s;olution to learn &s;ome trade; make him leave this country; in &s;hort, put him in a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y of getting his livelihood, which to me would be the heavie&s;t of bur|dens! Farewel, you &s;hall &s;ee me no more! Never &s;peak of me. Let him keep the &s;ecret of his birth; for a word may nigh co&s;t him his life!"&mdash;"What, my dear
<PB N="48" REF="030364_0050_0FE5D19DAE538EE0">
&s;ir," cried I, pro&s;trating my&s;elf, "can you be &s;o hard hearted? Unfortunate boy!&mdash;Will you then have him die? He will die, he will &s;urely die! Be his father, for he deems it his happine&s;s to be your &s;on!&mdash;A&s;&s;i&s;t him&mdash;protect him.&mdash;Alas!&mdash;he is &s;o amiable, &s;o virtu|ous!&mdash;Ah, &s;ir, I embrace your knees, I bedew them with my tears; li&s;ten to compa&s;&s;ion, to tenderne&s;s, and &s;tifle not in your heart the cries of nature!"&mdash;"Du|mont, you touch me, but I cannot&mdash;he is not my &s;on! Did you but know!&mdash;Oh! how I am to be pitied! Farewel! Let him take care of his life, and do you the &s;ame; for my de&s;tiny is &s;o dreadful as to make me the ruin of all tho&s;e who come near me!"</P>
<P>The&s;e words made me &s;hudder; I was going to an&s;wer; but he quickly put a pur&s;e into my hand, and vani&s;hed like a fla&s;h of lightning.</P>
<P>Judge of my a&s;toni&s;hment and grief. I ruminated mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly upon what re&s;olution I &s;hould take, and determined to conceal this cruel event, and live with you as long as po&s;&s;ible, on the &s;avings of your father's kindne&s;s, and the fruits of my own indu&s;try. Fifty louis d'ors contained in the pur&s;e, and nearly that &s;um which we had &s;aved, helped me to pay your quarter at college, to rent an apartment, to furni&s;h it decently. I di&s;charged Vincent, hired a maid, and prevailed up|on you to pay off and quit your ma&s;ters. Alas! in &s;pite of all my par&s;imony, I found that, after a twelve|month, I could only command twelve louis d'ors.</P>
<P>Fore&s;eeing that we &s;hould &s;oon be reduced to want, I re&s;olved to give le&s;&s;ons in town, in writing and La|tin; but of what &s;ervice could it be? I had but a few pupils, and even tho&s;e did not pay me! When you are on the brink of an aby&s;s, every one takes delight in pu&s;hing you into it. Your di&s;order and the care which it demanded of me, made me lo&s;e all my &s;cholars, and I was obliged to borrow the &s;um of five louis d'ors, which I obtained upon my note of hand; &s;ince that time I had done all in my power to di&s;charge that obligation, but the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, hindred me from accompli&s;hing my good purpo&s;e. I was, however, more indu&s;trious than before, for I worked night and day at a printer's, but earned &s;o little, as would hardly fetch the common nece&s;&s;aries of life and
<PB N="49" REF="030364_0051_0FE5D1A3CFC9E2A8">
hinder you from being aware of my mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>Now, my amiable Alexis, now I am deprived of liberty for a long time to come, what will become of you? Who is to take care of you? Who is to give you bread? Oh, lovely child, who has neither parents nor friends in this world, what will become of you?"</P>
<P>"O thou mo&s;t worthy pattern of friend&s;hip," ex|claimed I. "O thou boa&s;t of men! do you think I &s;hall &s;uffer you to remain in irons, with which I my|&s;elf have loaded the be&s;t of friends?&mdash;No, think not that I &s;hall have recour&s;e to the vain pity of man|kind! I am humbled by their genero&s;ity; and their favors, courted by ba&s;ene&s;s, would make me blu&s;h. Still, I have one re&s;ource left, a dear, a precious re|&s;ource, but it will become &s;till dearer and more pre|cious, as it is to atone for the injuries I have done to you.&mdash;O my worthy tutor, I &s;hall only quit you, to return and take you from this abode of horror."</P>
<P>Dumont, who under&s;tood that I meant the gold re|peater enriched with diamonds, which my father had given me, &s;trove though in vain, to detain me. I ha|&s;tened to a watchmaker's, who after much talk, paid me twenty-five louis d'ors for a watch, that ought to have fetched twice that &s;um, and I came back to di&s;|charge my friend's debt, and to break his irons! Think of the joy I felt when we returned to our apartment! I was almo&s;t out of my &s;en&s;es; I took Dumont in my arms, and thanked heaven for the re&s;ource it left me in &s;uch an exigency.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s my joy was followed by unea&s;ine&s;s, there was left no more than fifteen louis d'ors. What could we do with a &s;um &s;o moderate? How could we &s;ub&s;i&s;t much longer? My Dumont would not make me any propo&s;al to work, for fear of hurting my deli|cacy. I was &s;en&s;ible of his generous re&s;erve. I inti|mated to him my having conceived a project of teach|ing mu&s;ic in town, which he &s;ealed with his approba|tion. Mu&s;ic, &s;aid he, is an art one may teach with|out derogating; but my dear Alexis, how unplea&s;ant will you find it! you mu&s;t prepare to put up with the caprice, haughtine&s;s, and ill humors of a thou&s;and
<PB N="50" REF="030364_0052_0FE5D1A532DE6278">
people, who, de&s;titute of every &s;hadow of genius or parts, always blame their ma&s;ters for their own &s;tupi|dity: Since they pay, they fancy that &s;cience and dex|terity mu&s;t be acquired without either trouble or ap|plication. Often they will tell you: But, &s;ir, I have now learned &s;o many months, and know nothing, while Mrs. N&mdash;is already a complete mu&s;ician!&mdash;It will be in vain for you to tell them Mrs. N&mdash;has &s;tuck clo&s;er to the art, and that her utmo&s;t attention and docility have been always concerted to do honor to the le&s;&s;ons of her ma&s;ter. Ah! my Alexis, what a patience, what a politene&s;s, what a gentlene&s;s is re|quired of tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of in&s;tructing mankind in what &s;cience or art &s;oever! I pity you for being re|duced to recur to a &s;imilar expedient; but &s;till, it is decent, genteel, and not unworthy of your education, make therefore the be&s;t u&s;e of it you can.</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed to profit by his le&s;&s;ons, and we looked out on all &s;ides for pupils; but our &s;earches were fruit|le&s;s; we both had not the lea&s;t acquaintance; we had always avoided &s;ociety, and it was in the bo&s;om of it alone, we could have found the object of our eager pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Our money being gone, we &s;aw our&s;elves brought to the mo&s;t dreadful mi&s;ery. It was then, the mo&s;t &s;ad and di&s;tra&s;ting ideas &s;eized our mind. Death &s;eemed to be the only remedy to our ills, we called it loudly, and it would finally have come to relieve us, had not a cruel event extricated us from our forlorn condition to plunge us in a &s;tate, a thou&s;and times more deplorable.</P>
<P>In one of our morning walks in the royal botanical garden, a venerable grey head ru&s;hed by us, attend|ed by a young man of about thirty, in who&s;e counte|nance were painted gloomine&s;s and &s;orrow. The lat|ter ca&s;t his eyes on me, and exclaimed with an irre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ti|ble tran&s;port: "It is he; my father! there he is! oh, it is he! the&s;e are the marquis's features."&mdash;"You dont &s;ay &s;o," replied the old man.&mdash;"I would lay any thing," &s;aid the other, adding in a whi&s;per, "there, we have him at la&s;t, that wretch whom we &s;ought &s;o long! He &s;hall peri&s;h."</P>
<P>Hereupon the two &s;trangers le&s;t us quite &s;tupified at
<PB N="51" REF="030364_0053_0FE5D1A7515F8280">
this adventure, and &s;o &s;ingular a retreat. "Dear Du|mont," exclaimed I, &s;hedding a torrent of tears, "I am lo&s;t, now my fate is determinated!" "Softly A|lexis, de&s;pair not, my dear child; a&s;toni&s;hing as this adventure is, it ought not to alarm you &s;o much; peo|ple will not be killed in that manner. Never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, they will not cut your throat at home"</P>
<P>"But &s;ir what have I done to tho&s;e cruel men? O heaven! who will apprize me of my crimes?"</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont was as much terrified as I. The&s;e &s;trangers mu&s;t therefore, have been &s;ome &s;ecret ene|mies who have con&s;pired my ruin. It was from them I was to hide my&s;elf, but why? What a cruel enigma.</P>
<P>We went home, where Mr. Dumont was of opin|ion that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to decamp immediate|ly from our lodgings, le&s;t we &s;hould be di&s;covered: But there was one difficulty: We had neither money nor means to procure us wherewithal to pay our rent. Only judge of our anxiety.</P>
<P>We &s;pent the day in deadly fright; we projected twenty different expedients, rejected them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and night &s;urprized us without having taken any re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>About midnight we heard &s;everal hard knocks a|gain&s;t our &s;treet door: how our hearts beat then!&mdash;I fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s in Mr. Dumont's arms who was him|&s;elf no le&s;s afraid. A lodger opened the &s;treet-door, and informed us through the key hole of our apart|ment that we were wanted.</P>
<P>Shall we open? &s;hall we an&s;wer? What is to be done? At la&s;t Dumout &s;hews a noble re&s;olutene&s;s, and is determined either to &s;tand or fall in my cau&s;e, if a|ny violence &s;hould be offered to me. He opens to let in the &s;tranger: It was a &s;ervant, who, in a humble and re&s;pectful manner, begged us to be of good cheer, and &s;aid to us in a whi&s;per: Quick, gentlemen, peru&s;e this, and follow me.</P>
<P>O happine&s;s! O unexpected favor! It is my fa|ther's, I know his hand writing.</P>
<P>"Imprudent Alexis! your father is &s;till inclined to &s;ave your life, perhaps at this very moment you have

di&s;po&s;ed of his own. Follow this &s;turdy &s;ervant!&mdash;Come, you will find me at Valence; and you, Mr. Dumont, leave not your pupil: I am in great want of you.</P>
<P>"A way with &s;cruples, depart in&s;tantly, or you are both undone."</P>
<P>This was no &s;nare; we plainly knew my father's writing.&mdash;"Whether &s;hall we," a&s;ked I of the &s;er|vant.&mdash;"You &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, only follow me."</P>
<P>This man having delivered a con&s;iderable &s;um with his me&s;&s;age, we paid our landlord, and &s;et out that ve|ry moment; a po&s;t chai&s;e was waiting for us at a lit|tle di&s;tance, we got into it, and took the road to Va|lence.</P>
<P>Judge of the thoughts which revolved in our minds! My father waited for us at Valence. We were going to &s;ee him again: His letter denoted either anger or hatred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Complete happine&s;s &s;parkled in our eyes;&mdash;what a change, what a good fortune! But what could he mean by the epithet <HI>imprudent?</HI> He &s;aid I had per|haps ju&s;t been di&s;po&s;ing of his own life. Alas! if I did, how can he accu&s;e me?</P>
<P>This was the unea&s;ine&s;s which perplexed us all the way to Valence. We were &s;u&s;pended between fear and hope. Our guide was &s;ilent, nor could we get from him the lea&s;t idea of what we wanted to know.</P>
<P>We reached the city of Valence about eight o'clock in the evening&punc; after a journey of three days. Our guide conducted us to a fine inn, where he inquired whether or not a gentleman of &s;uch a di&s;cription was arrived. A po&s;t boy then pre&s;ent, an&s;wered in the ne|gative, adding, that, to all appearance, it was the &s;ame gentleman whom he had left at Lyons, and as he could be but one po&s;t farther, he would arrive either that night or in the morning.</P>
<P>Hearing this we re&s;olved to go to &s;upper, and then re&s;t our&s;elves, till Aurora &s;hould return with my fa|ther, and crown all my wi&s;hes. I don't know what a happy pre&s;entment agitated our brea&s;ts. My. Dumont embraced me, and took me in his arms, &s;aying con|tinually, "Courage, my Alexis, we &s;hall &s;ee him again." What a &s;educing picture offered it&s;elf to my &s;en&s;es,
<PB N="53" REF="030364_0055_0FE5D1B596078AA8">
"We &s;hall be all one heart, one family! O my Alexis, receive my mo&s;t &s;acred oath, I will never abandon you. Grant me always your confidence; and may I be equal|ly fortunate to de&s;erve that of your father."</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed him to my heart without giving any an&s;wer. Such were the flattering images which amu&s;ed us un|til four o'clock in the morning, when the &s;udden rat|tling of a po&s;t chai&s;e, which &s;topped before the inn, rou&s;ed us from our &s;weet reverie.</P>
<P>"It is he," exclaimed I, and we both ran down &s;tairs to receive him; but O &s;urpri&s;e! the moment I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fly|ing to his arms, my father&mdash;O heaven! my father frowns at me mo&s;t terribly, pu&s;hes me from him, bids us walk up &s;tairs to a remote apartment of the hou&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ed me with the following horrible &s;peech, which &s;hall remain in my memory, to the la&s;t breath of my wretched being.</P>
<P>"You are not my &s;on, &s;ir, I told you &s;o. I was weak enough to entertain that flattering error; but the blind is thrown off. To my misfortune you are born; and as &s;uch you have an&s;wered your end. Get thee far from me, unhappy lad&mdash;I reject thee from my bo|&s;om&mdash;I di&s;claim, I for&s;ake, and cur&s;e thee forever."</P>
<P>I trembled at the&s;e words, my &s;pirits fled, and I dropped down &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the floor. Far from giv|ing me the &s;malle&s;t &s;uccor, the barbarous men&mdash;&s;hall I proceed in this di&s;mal &s;tory? O amiable ho&s;ts, you will be as much &s;urpri&s;ed as I was in that cruel mo|ment! Suffer me, ah! &s;uffer me to dry my tears: I feel they hinder me from going farther.</P>
<P>I remained in that condition for an hour; judge of my &s;urpri&s;e, when I recovered my &s;en&s;es! My father and Dumont have left me; I &s;ee them not&mdash;where be they?</P>
<P>A woman, to whom I was indebted for the misfor|tune of opening again my eyes to light, &s;tands by me; &s;he endeavors to comfort me. "Where are they, where are they?" "Alas, my dear child, they &s;et out about three quarters of an hour ago."&mdash;"And gone! good God! and Dumont, Dumont too."</P>
<P>I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ituation: You may ea&s;ily conceive it if your hearts are feeling and

<P>I run down &s;tairs, and made the whole hou&s;e re|echo with my woful lamentations. Every body a&s;|&s;ures me that Dumont and my father &s;et out together in the &s;ame chai&s;e, which had &s;topped with the latter before the inn. What a blow&mdash;a terrible blow!</P>
<P>Soon my grief ceded to a &s;ullen and &s;ettled de&s;|pair; fits of rage &s;ucceeded to it, and, in &s;pite of the a&s;&s;iduous care and con&s;olation of tho&s;e who &s;urround|ed me, I dropped down upon the floor, and rolled my|&s;elf upon it; I &s;wallowed the du&s;t, and put forth the mo&s;t di&s;mal cries; cries that would have moved the mo&s;t flinty heart.</P>
<P>In this cruel &s;tate I remained until three o'clock in the afternoon; bereft of my &s;en&s;es, I could hardly &s;ee what was doing about me. "The poor lad," &s;aid they, "don't you &s;ee that it was his father and his preceptor; they have for&s;aken him. Oh, had we known it, they &s;hould not have got off &s;o ea&s;y&mdash;But no, they go: Take care of him! they may come back. How barbarous! What a pity at &s;uch an age, &amp;c."</P>
<P>My &s;ituation &s;eemed to touch every body, and all offered to relieve me, but I was far from accepting any &s;uccor. The ma&s;ter of the inn invited me to &s;tay at his hou&s;e: I will give you &s;ome employment, my good friend; you &s;hall not want for what is nece&s;&s;ary. To be &s;ure you wont be &s;o well off as you was at your father's, for there is nothing like home, after all, &amp;c. &amp;c." Every word he &s;aid thru&s;t dag|gers into my heart. I re&s;olved to rid my&s;elf of his importunities, and taking my baggage upon my back took leave of them all.</P>
<P>I left Valence, perplexed with the mo&s;t dreadful thoughts, but making God and religion my &s;hield, I &s;oon repul&s;ed tho&s;e enemies which preyed upon all my &s;en&s;es, and I &s;aw my&s;elf before the town of Ro|mans at the decline of day.</P>
<P>Thus Alexis ended the hi&s;tory of his misfortunes, and Candour, Germain, and Clara, embraced and &s;hew him every token of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility. A frugal repa&s;t was &s;erved up, and the remaining

<P>THE narrative of our hero's misfortunes operated, in a &s;ingular manner, upon Candor, Germain, and Clara. Candor, above all could not be tired on looking at him for the whole time the &s;upper la&s;ted. He had placed Alexis next to him, and from time to time would exclaim, "What, my &s;on&mdash;&s;o young and &s;uch a knowledge of mankind;&mdash;How, you know them well;&mdash;Your philo&s;ophy, your courage, all in thee intere&s;t me to a point. O my Alexis, I depend upon your &s;teadine&s;s with the mo&s;t con&s;olatory expect|ations. I will di&s;clo&s;e them &s;ome day, you &s;hall help me. But &s;tay, I will try you for a twelvemonth. Be my &s;on, you have no father; let me &s;upply his place. Alexis, promi&s;e me as much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and docility as you would for a father!"&mdash;"Yes, father, I promi&s;e every thing." "Upon your honor?" "Heaven be my witne&s;s." "Give me thy hand, and remember one day the &s;acred engagement you have entered into with Candor." Your favors will never make me forget it." "I was happy and powerful in the world, my clo&s;e&s;t bo&s;om friends have thrown me into the aby&s;s of ills; Germain alone &s;tood by me, Germain, my good and hone&s;t friend, love him as I do: what a trea&s;ure is a tru&s;ty, faithful &s;ervant. Behold Clara; my only daughter, my every thing&mdash;be her tutor; teach her all the &s;ciences, all the accompli&s;hments you are ma&s;ter of: May &s;he profit by your le&s;&s;ons, and above all may &s;he take
<PB N="56" REF="030364_0058_0FE5D1C201750048">
your &s;age advice, that prudence, that mi&s;tru&s;t in man|kind, qualities &s;o requi&s;ite for a being de&s;tined to live &s;ome day in the bo&s;om of &s;ociety. For I am old and hoary, my good children, I cannot always be with you, and when I am once gone, perhaps you may have the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of living in towns, of launching into the whirlpool." "Ah, never, never," an&s;wered Alexis and Clara, in conjunction with each other.</P>
<P>Alexis was tran&s;ported with joy. Clara &s;queezed his hand, embraced her father and Germain, and en|raptured with the happy pro&s;pect that glowed in her beauteous eyes, &s;he could not conceal her &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>They &s;oon aro&s;e from their frugal repa&s;t, and Can|dor would have Alexis to take an exact view of the hermitage, in which the old man thought he would remain for life.</P>
<P>Clara laid hold immediately of the youth's arm, Candor, &s;upported him&s;elf on Germain's &s;houlder, and all four went to vi&s;it the &s;everal parts of this re|treat. Let us follow their traces, and get acquainted with an abode where we &s;hall, for &s;ome time, dwell with them.</P>
<P>They fir&s;t entered a yard, ninety feet &s;quare, its cen|tre is occupied by the cottage. The lateral extent of the edifice is thirty, and the height fifty feet.</P>
<P>They a&s;cend four &s;teps, enter a &s;mall ve&s;tibule; where Alexis perceives at the bottom of the &s;tairs, two doors, the one on the right and the other on the left. The fir&s;t conducts to the kitchen, and the &s;econd to a hall fifteen feet high, furni&s;hed with a chimney, a table, chairs, and a con&s;iderable library.</P>
<P>He leaves the hall, and goes up &s;ome winding &s;tairs to the fir&s;t floor; on this &s;ide is Candor's bed chamber. A bed, a large che&s;t of drawers, two portraits, half a dozen of fowling pieces, and &s;ome chairs are the only furniture he &s;ees in it.</P>
<P>Clara's chamber is not better decorated, excepting a fine harp&s;icord which takes up the greate&s;t part of the room.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd &s;tory he enters two little rooms, with|out a chimney, but very &s;nug and decent.</P>
<P>Above them is a large garret, which &s;upplies the place of a hay loft, and granary.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="030364_0059_0FE5D1BD60DE1BB8">
Every ceiling is vaulted, and built of &s;tone: Every window of the apartments is grated with iron bars, and does not exceed &s;ix feet in height. Below &s;tairs is a door leading to a cellar, to which no body but Can|dor and Germain, had acce&s;s. This cave or cellar contains neither wine nor liquors, (our hermits had long &s;ince left off to make u&s;e of them) there is nothing pent in it but&mdash;This is a my&s;tery we &s;hall certainly di&s;cover hereafter, but now it mu&s;t remain concealed. Let us therefore follow our hero to the garden.</P>
<P>It is an inclo&s;ure of about an acre and an half, the third part planted with peas, beans, potatoes, oats, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the remainder a meadow yielding hay for the hor&s;e. There were al&s;o &s;everal fruit trees, and at the garden's end, a very lofty poplar, which appeared to have been left &s;ince the ground was fir&s;t cleared to build the cottage and its premi&s;es. At the foot of the poplar, a limpid rivulet &s;pringing from a remote part of the woods, &s;treams over a layer of pebbles, and ea&s;es it&s;elf in a frightful precipice, at the di&s;tance of two leagues from the cottage.</P>
<P>The rivulet, cro&s;&s;ing the little garden, is hemmed in its career by a dike of &s;hell work, which it &s;urmounts, and forms a ca&s;cade, who&s;e waters, fall into a ba&s;on near the meadow, hewn, as it were, by the hand of na|ture, in the heart of a rock.</P>
<P>A little bridge leading to a grove, the work of Can|dor, invites the philo&s;opher to ta&s;te the &s;weets of the evening, and re&s;t from the toils of the day: the whole of this rural and tranquil re&s;idence breathes calm tho't and &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Alexis &s;urveying with admiration tho&s;e wonders of art and nature, lifted up his hand to heaven, to return thanks to the &s;ublime Author, for having brought him to this delightful abode, where he can at lea&s;t enjoy repo&s;e in the arms of the only beings, in who&s;e hearts he had found genero&s;ity, &s;ympathy and virtue.</P>
<P>Clara, who was leading him before her father, eager to &s;hew him all the beauties of her garden, did not fail to expatiate upon its charms. "Do you &s;ee," &s;aid &s;he, "yonder that field? I alone have cultivate it; but now, as you are my partner, my labor will be changed
<PB N="58" REF="030364_0060_0FE5D1C2CF6EB2E8">
into mere plea&s;ure: It is in this rivulet we &s;hall quench our thir&s;t; you will offer me this limped water, and I will receive it at your hands: here you will &s;mile; there you will &s;eek &s;helter from the heat of day: I will pre&s;s one of tho&s;e fruits upon your burning lips, and its nect|ar will refre&s;h your blood. Oh! how often &s;hall we at the decline of day, go to take re&s;t in the grove. It is there, unknown to all the world far from the bu&s;tling and noi&s;e of cities, we &s;hall ble&s;s and endear our being. The &s;un goes down, the moon plays, here and there, her &s;ilver beams through the foliage of the thicket. The bo&s;om of the earth opens and and exhales a thou|&s;and perfumes. We fit by one another; the gentle purling of this rivulet, which glides beneath our feet, throws us into the &s;weets of thought; you pre&s;s my hand to your heart, it beats, we give up all thinking; yet we gaze and enjoy! O Alexis, Alexis, belive thy Clara, "HERE SHALT THOU FIND HAPPINESS."</P>
<P>In vain Alexis endeavored to reply, his feelings would not &s;uffer him to expre&s;s his thoughts; he contented him&s;elf with &s;queezing Clara's hand, and holding her with that expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment which is more obvious to the pencil than to the eloquence. "O yes," &s;aid he, with a low voice, "yes I am already as happy as mortal can be."</P>
<P>Candor and Germain who came &s;oon after, found the young couple in the extacy of delight. Germain &s;hook his head, Candor &s;miled, and his children were put to the blu&s;h.</P>
<P>By this time the night began to lower upon nature. The birds perched in the wood, waited the retreat of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to &s;u&s;pend their warbling, and to re&s;t upon the ho&s;pitable branch. The nightingale alone enchanted the woods with her &s;weet melodies, and the moping owl, in deferrence to her, forebore her funeral howlings. All invited our anchorets to return to the cottage, to enjoy a repo&s;e, claimed by the emotions which they felt that day, and the fatigue the preceding night.</P>
<P>They had no convenience to &s;ub&s;titute artificial light to that of day; the &s;un &s;hut their eyes, and aurora re|opened them. Thus they retired to their re&s;pective a|partments, not to meet till day break.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="030364_0061_0FE5D1C4317F43C0">
Alexis, having received the tender embrace of the three ho&s;ts went up &s;tairs to his room &s;ituated on the &s;e|cond floor; he was determined to reject the calls of &s;leep, to reflect freely upon his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and upon what conduct he &s;hould ob&s;erve towards his new friends, &s;o as to convince them of his gratitude and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>He had already forgot his mi&s;anthropy and mi&s;|tru&s;t, when a very particular event revived them, bolted in his mind, and perplexed his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>He had hardly commenced his meditations, than he heard a noi&s;e at the door: He li&s;tens, hears the rattling of keys, one is put in the lock of his door, he a&s;ks who is there? no an&s;wer, in a moment the door is lock|ed, and the jailor di&s;appears! What means this unex|pected precaution? why will they &s;hut him up? what do they want of him? O heaven! &s;hould it be treachery? the hou&s;e where he was received with open arms, &s;hould it be a den of ruffians? what, Candor, Germain, Clara, Clara! it is impo&s;&s;ible. Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s cannot conceal it&s;elf &s;o well under the ma&s;k of virtue: A look a ge&s;|ture, the lea&s;t motions detect it. They are not traitors, but why is he locked up? they have not appri&s;ed him of this detention; nor even did his jailor give him an an&s;wer. Ah! they &s;urely will undo him! he has been too confident, too indi&s;creet: He &s;hould not have expo&s;ed him&s;elf; In a word, people, that inhabit a for|tified retreat, in a fore&s;t notorious for its robbers and banditti. All becomes &s;u&s;picion to him: he recollects the conver&s;ation of the day, an expre&s;&s;ion of Candor's chills him with terror; <HI>O my Alexis! I depend upon your &s;teadine&s;s with the mo&s;t con&s;olatory expectation. I will di&s;clo&s;e them &s;ome day; you &s;hall help me.</HI> Great God! will they con&s;train a virtuous and well principled youth to become a robber! after all, what do they mean by this? &s;hould not the cellar which they would not let him &s;ee, conceal the murdered victims and the &s;poil? &s;ure|ly this di&s;cour&s;e, and my&s;terious cellar conceal crimes. Alexis doubts no longer, his head becomes light, his imagination works, gha&s;tly &s;pectres appear to him, hor|rid phantoms, from all &s;ides cro&s;s his chamber, his hair &s;tands at an end, his tongue becomes heavy, he
<PB N="60" REF="030364_0062_0FE5D1CCDA8D0EE0">
remains motionle&s;s, and re&s;olves upon &s;ome violent mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The window of his room was on the garden &s;ide, he runs to it, he will elope from the fatal hou&s;e where the mo&s;t dreadful omens trouble his rea&s;on. But an unfore&s;een ob&s;tacle is in his way, and &s;anctions his &s;u&s;|picions by certainty. Large iron bars oppo&s;e his de|&s;ign: It is all over, he is impri&s;oned, betrayed, un|done.</P>
<P>As the timid bird who falls into the net, and is af|terwards put in a cage, beats the ho&s;tile wire with its wings, and pa&s;&s;ing his bill acro&s;s, pants for the tree, which he perceives, and on which he was perched a little before; thus our hero applies his mouth to the fatal bars, beholding acro&s;s the garden, and the va&s;t extent of the fore&s;t, who&s;e gloomy abode appears to him preferable to the odious pri&s;on, where he pre&s;umes he will be obliged to remain all his life time.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all this, his &s;en&s;ible &s;oul was &s;till to un|dergo another &s;hock. Will he have &s;trength &s;ufficient to bear the frightful &s;pectacle that will pre&s;ent it&s;elf to his fight? At fir&s;t he hears &s;omebody &s;hut the door of the cellar, that object of his terror, with a terrible noi&s;e, &s;oon after Candor, and Germain come forth, carrying each a lighted flambeaux in their hands. A kind of a coffin covered with a pall, is &s;een on their &s;houlders: They &s;ilently cro&s;s the garden, and ad|vance to the foot of the poplar tree, near the borders of the limpid rivulet: Here they take off their bur|den, and the di&s;tance only hinders Alexis from hearing or &s;eeing what they do.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Candor appears to open the coffin: He lays down upon it, he ri&s;es again, a fire is kindled, the flame blazes, ri&s;es, and on a &s;udden becomes ex|tinct: the tree is glanced, the leaves tremble, and the birds &s;itting on its branches flee with di&s;mal &s;hrieks: the flambeaux are ex&s;tingui&s;hed, all vani&s;hes.</P>
<P>It is an illu&s;ion? is it a phantom? the moon ren|dered ob&s;cure by the pale light of the torches &s;pread alone her my&s;tic beams: the birds return to their wonted tree, Candor and Germain appear again, they
<PB N="61" REF="030364_0063_0FE5D1CDD1B86C38">
cro&s;s the garden, return to &s;et by the coffin in the &s;e|cret cave, the door is &s;hut, the rattling of keys, and the hollow &s;ound of bolts are heard again.</P>
<P>Let now the reader place him&s;elf in the &s;ituation of my Alexis. He knows his fearful, &s;u&s;picions, and mi&s;tru&s;ting temper! Let him have an idea of his em|barra&s;&s;ment, his apprehen&s;ions, his &s;huddering! How agitated his mind! That coffin, that flame! what can have been that ceremony he could not di&s;tingui&s;h: It is perhaps the body of &s;ome &s;trayed traveller, which they burnt, after having &s;tripped it. He doubts no more: To morrow the &s;ame fate awaits him: But where are his riches? why &s;hould they kill him? his &s;poil is not brilliant enough: No matter, he has all to fear. Perhaps Candor, deceived by the world, has &s;worn to &s;acrifice all &s;uch as will fall in his hands, to gratify his vengeance. Alexis is perhaps to augment the number of his victims: all confirm him in that idea. Alas! what has he done, that fate &s;hould have brought him to this dete&s;table den! He regrets not life, it is a burden to him! but to fall by &s;o ba&s;e a treachery, af|ter having tru&s;ted to the good faith and humanity of his butchers. This, this alone, cau&s;es his de&s;pair, and makes him wi&s;h for the approach of day, in order to take a re&s;olution: He will not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;laughtered thus patiently; he will &s;ell his life as dear as he can. Tremble a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, you &s;hall not give him the mortal blow without having &s;tood mo&s;t vigorous in his own defence again&s;t Candor, Germain, and&mdash;Clara! what, is Clara guilty too?</P>

<P>AURORA had di&s;pelled night, and the &s;un began to gild the tops of the trees, a cloudle&s;s azure &s;ky proclaimed a &s;erene day, and &s;oon the balmy fre&s;h|ne&s;s,

in&s;tilled by Zephyr in the brilliant pearls of the dew, was going to yield to the ardent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">res of the me|ridian; all nature was beauteous and tranquil; but the heart of Alexis was not.</P>
<P>Pale, trembling, bewildered, he waited the fatal doom of death; already had he recommended him&s;elf to the mercy of the &s;upreme Being&punc; Prayer, in &s;ome manner, re&s;tored the calm of his &s;en&s;es; he ju&s;t ro&s;e from his knees, when a gentle voice call him; "A|lexis, are you awake?"&mdash;"Yes," exclaimed he, "yes, I am, and prepared for all events!"&mdash;"It is Candor," replied the voice, "he comes to open your door and to embrace you!"</P>
<P><HI>To embrace you!</HI>&mdash;Alexis was quite a&s;toni&s;hed: Was this a new &s;nare? Did his judgment deceive him? he made a thou&s;and conjectures, when Candor opens the door, enters, and is &s;truck with the perplexity of his friend. He looks at him, lays hold of his hand, and, with &s;uch an air of penetration and truth, that Alexis cannot help li&s;tening to him, and makes him blu&s;h at his errors; he &s;ays, "What have you, my &s;on&mdash;what means the trouble in which I &s;ee you?&mdash;Is it becau&s;e I have kept you la&s;t night in a kind of captivity?&mdash;My friend, you would have wronged me, not to confide in your Candor?&mdash;I cannot believe it:&mdash;I would be a|&s;hamed to think&mdash;compo&s;e your&s;elf, hear your father, and conquer that childi&s;h fear which cannot but grieve me.</P>
<P>"You were looked up la&s;t night, and every future night I mu&s;t ob&s;erve the &s;ame precaution, which is more e&s;&s;ential to me than you imagine. It ought not to alarm you, becau&s;e, the whole day I &s;hall give you a thou&s;and proofs of my &s;incere, friend&s;hip; but I in&s;i&s;t upon your not endeavoring to penetrate into that fatal &s;ecret. It is all I cheri&s;h, it is all I po&s;&s;e&s;s, do not tear it from me! My Alexis, did you but know!&mdash;De&s;erve my confidence, be always &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, tender, and re|gardful; and &s;oon I will di&s;clo&s;e you my condition and misfortunes. Make your&s;elf worthy of that confe&s;&s;ion!&mdash;I will not conceal it from you; nay, I expect of you a mo&s;t &s;ignal &s;ervice&mdash;but a &s;ervice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded upon ju&s;|tice and gratitude, which, if you love me, will never
<PB N="63" REF="030364_0065_0FE5D1D0AC4AF958">
affect your delicacy. I am old. Alexis, I have been inhumanly betrayed; I was deprived of what I held mo&s;t dear on earth. You &s;hall be mine avenger.&mdash;You &s;hall de&s;erve the charming recompen&s;e, which I have de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lined for you; the charming recompen&s;e which will be dear to your heart!&mdash;Urge me not to &s;ay more&mdash;I conjure you, let me keep my &s;ecret for a while&mdash;one day I will depo&s;it it in your bo&s;om&mdash;you will know me then; but as yet, I am compelled to re&s;train your curio&s;ity; I do not con&s;true it into a crime, it is natural to your age. Every night permit me to look you up, I beg it as a favor! On the&s;e terms live with us, di&s;pel all cares and anxiety, and be truly per|&s;uaded that your innocence is in no kind of danger in this &s;olitary abode; we all cheri&s;h religion, wi&s;dom and virtue!"</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e, and the venerable appearance of the old man, rid Alexis of all perplexity. The balm of con&s;olation de&s;cended into his heart, and &s;erenity en|livened again his countenance. His &s;oul was frank and hone&s;t; he communicated his fooli&s;h panic to Candor, &s;miled and embraced him. Clara's father was &s;ome time confu&s;ed when he heard that Alexis had &s;een his nocturnal ceremony; but &s;oon he recovered him&s;elf, laid hold of his arm, and both went below to Clara, who had ju&s;t ri&s;en, and had as bad a night as her young friend, but from a cau&s;e of a quite oppo&s;ite na|ture. Love, which began to enter her heart, the hap|pine&s;s which awaited her, and her own flattering no|tions, had kept her awake all night long; but it only &s;erved to add new energy to her charms; her eyes betrayed an air of langor, for which her father chid her, and &s;he blu&s;hed with &s;o much grace, as made Alexis quite contrite for having doubted a &s;ingle mi|nute the &s;incerity of that lovely child.</P>
<P>Soon after, Germain joined them, and they all three reque&s;ted their new gue&s;t to give them a &s;pecimen of his abilities on the harp&s;ichord. Alexis, with eager compliance, &s;ung his romance, and the audience could not forbear &s;hedding tears.</P>
<P>Clara performed after him, and though her &s;kill was not equal in point of perfection to that of Alexis, he
<PB N="64" REF="030364_0066_0FE5D1D173505A40">
was enraptured with her performance, e&s;pecially with a &s;ong &s;he added to it. She had compo&s;ed it during night, and the mu&s;ic was &s;o &s;weet and melodious, as to leave Candor much in doubt of its being of her own compo&s;ing.</P>

<P>Thus the day was &s;pent in plea&s;ing amu&s;ement. At night Alexis was locked up, but felt no unea&s;ine&s;s, and enjoyed a &s;ound &s;leep.</P>
<P>It had been determined that Alexis &s;hould begin his le&s;&s;ons with Clara on the day following; he of cour&s;e went to her apartment.

<HEAD>(Some part of the Manu&s;cript is wanting.)</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE VOICE IN THE FOREST.</HEAD>
<P>ALEXIS, happy and cheri&s;hed in the cottage, had forgot his misfortunes. Mu&s;ic, agriculture, and &s;ometimes the &s;port of the cha&s;e in the fore&s;t took up all his time, and left him no lei&s;ure to be di&s;gu&s;ted.</P>
<P>How &s;weet and innocent we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the plea&s;ures of our &s;our hermits! They had every thing they wanted; de|&s;ired no more, and all nature &s;eemed to re&s;pect their re|treat, and to co-operate in their happine&s;s. The thun|der which &s;truck ince&s;&s;antly the loftie&s;t trees of the for|e&s;t, had never de&s;cended on their premi&s;es; the robbers, who were heard all day long, crying and &s;houting about its walls, had never formed the de&s;ign, perhaps impracticable, to &s;cale them. Germain le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the cot|tage only once a year to go to St. Marcellin, to buy corn, and doubtle&s;s by a vi&s;ible protection of heaven, he had never been attacked, except the la&s;t time, when he was relieved by Alexis&punc; Candor had expre&s;sly enjoined Clara not to tell her young friend where &s;he had been on the day &s;he had met with him in the valley of Ro|mans, becau&s;e he him&s;elf intended to give one day every detail of it to Alexis, and exact from his hand a mo&s;t terrible revenge, which he wi&s;hed to take of his ene|mies before he &s;hould go down to the grave.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this intent, he &s;tudied daily the character and temper of Alexis, and flattered him&s;elf to &s;ee him always &s;teady and courageous; he thanked heaven, for having &s;ent him in his ills a being perhaps the only one on earth, capable to execute his projects. It was with complacency he beheld the love &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the young couple; he protected&punc; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ven &s;trengthened it, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it would one day turn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is advantage. His daughter kept no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im; he calculated the progre&s;s of this pa&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="69" REF="030364_0071_0FE5D1EF1801D408">
waited till it had reached its highe&s;t pitch, to di&s;clo&s;e his &s;ecrets to Alexis. In the mean time he command|ed Clara not to &s;uffer her lover to take the &s;malle&s;t liberty with her: He followed them where&s;oever they went&punc; watched them carefully, and apprehending their innocence might be in danger in the little grove, he al|ways joined them there, brought them back to the cottage, and, not &s;ufficiently confident of his own vigi|lance, he made choice of Germain to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>All the&s;e precautions were to no purpo&s;e; Alexis was too delicate, too virtuous to infringe upon the laws of ho&s;pitality&punc; and Clara endowed with too much pru|dence and re&s;pect to di&s;obey her father, and commit a fault, which &s;he would never have been able to own. On the other hand, their pa&s;&s;ion was protected, and they had the promi&s;e to be united. They were at liberty to love and declare their mutual pa&s;&s;ion before Candor. This freedom bani&s;hed the very idea of crime; and if love &s;ometimes ventured to put the blind upon their eyes, the light of truth &s;oon &s;hook it off, with offering to their &s;ight the aby&s;s in which they would plu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ge them&s;elves, and a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and remor&s;e ever rea|dy to a&s;&s;ail them upon leaving the grove.</P>
<P>Thus the two children loved one another; but their love was pure, decent, grounded upon virtue, upon &s;elf-e&s;teem, and the voluntary con&s;ent of a father.</P>
<P>Sweet &s;ympathy of the &s;oul, un&s;ullied by the mean impul&s;e of &s;en&s;uality, &s;atisfied with calm &s;entiment and reflection, a &s;tranger to &s;ore remor&s;e, to guilty &s;ecre&s;y, to guilty diffidence, and &s;anctioned by paternal autho|rity&mdash;ah! how few are the hearts de&s;tined to feel thy delights!</P>
<P>Alexis, who by this time perceived the &s;crupulous vigilance of Candor and Germain, deemed it an af|front upon his principles. The &s;ole idea of being &s;u&s;|pected of treachery, &s;apped the happine&s;s he enjoyed.

O Candor, Candor&punc; how you grieve me!</P>
<P>Candor often &s;urpri&s;ed him in the&s;e acce&s;&s;es of a gloomy temper; he inquired for the cau&s;e of his trou|ble, but Alexis remained &s;ilent; the remembrance of his misfortunes was his excu&s;e; and the old man, who knew him to be candid and &s;incere, believed, comfort|ed and engaged him to a walk in the garden, and, part|ly by his care&s;&s;es, partly by dint of argument, di&s;&s;ipat|ed the melancholy of his young friend.</P>

<P>In this manner, Candor, Clara, Alexis and Germain, pa&s;&s;ed their life at the Cottage.

<P>At the expiration of a twelvemonth, our young couple loved no more, but adored each other. It was a violent pa&s;&s;ion which nothing could keep within bounds but the hope of a &s;peedy union. They were determined to &s;peak of it to Candor, and to crave upon their knees his parental ble&s;&s;ing, as a tie as &s;acred

in their eyes, as the augu&s;t ceremony of wedlock, which they had no opportunity to obtain; but the old man; equally cunning and vindictive, had waited for that in&s;tant, to lay open his projects to Alexis. He had him&s;elf fo&s;tered in his brea&s;t the flames of love, and &s;uffered the pa&s;&s;ion of Alexis to attain the very pitch of violence, only with a view to be convinced of his fidel|ity to &s;erve him.

<P>Clara ki&s;&s;ed her father's hand, and repaired to her apartment where &s;he wept bitterly. Thus &s;he &s;pent the be&s;t part of the evening and night, without &s;eeing either Candor or Germain! The latter came finally to open her pri&s;on (for &s;he had been under key;) "Cla|ra, (&s;aid he) follow me, you will &s;ee him again."&mdash;"Who? Alexis?"&mdash;"Him&s;elf, he is here."&mdash;"O heaven! &s;hall I&mdash;yes, I will&mdash;let us go, Germain, con|duct me to the traitor!&mdash;will he be able to &s;tand in my pre&s;ence?"</P>
<P>Thus &s;he &s;poke&mdash;Germain immediately laid hold of her hand, and made her go down to the place where &s;he had never been before; but let us not dwell on a de&s;crip|tion of it, which we &s;hall give hereafter; but let us &s;ee how Alexis was conducted to it.</P>
<P>We left him in a cavern of the fore&s;t, haunted by remor&s;e and fanta&s;tic apparitions. He was now an hour in it, when he thought he heard a voice at the bottom of the &s;ubterranean; He li&s;tens, the voice ut|ters his name; it is no vi&s;ion, a feeble light glimmers at a di&s;tance before him. Is it a &s;nare? &s;hall he go and follow that voice which may make him tumble into &s;ome aby&s;s? Yes, Alexis, promoted by a &s;upernat|ural courage; ri&s;ks the adventure. Who&s;oever you be, (calls he out to the man who carried the light, who&s;e features he could not di&s;tingui&s;h) who&s;oever you be, I will follow you boldly; but what do you want of me? No an&s;wer is given. He advances, and the light di&s;|appears before him. What intrepidity in a young man of eighteen; to be &s;ure &s;o extraordinary an ad|venture was worth his notice: Alexis thought he &s;aw &s;pectres&mdash;he trembled&mdash;now he followed a man, and
<PB N="80" REF="030364_0082_0FE5D248F2778A58">
his firmne&s;s returned: frightful illu&s;ions often deceive more than credulity.</P>
<P>He therefore walked before his guide, and di&s;tance always hindered him from recognizing his face. His pa&s;&s;age took up about another hour; he remarked a thou&s;and beauties in this grotto; now a &s;upurb petri|faction offered it&s;elf to his &s;ight, then a little rivulet running over layers of pebbles pre&s;ented It&s;elf to him, and all on a &s;udden le&s;t him to lo&s;e it&s;elf in the hol|low of a rock. In &s;hort, this va&s;t grotto appeared ra|ther the work of nature than of art.</P>
<P>At the end of the cavern the guide opened a door, and di&s;appeared. Alexis, by the light which he per|ceived acro&s;s the door, pur&s;ued his way, and his a&s;ton|i&s;hment became &s;o great as not to permit him to think. At la&s;t he &s;aw him&s;elf in a &s;plendid temple, who&s;e door &s;hut it&s;elf after him. The floor and columns were of black marble, and on the ceiling hung a lamp which ca&s;t a deadly gleam. In the centre of the tem|ple, &s;everal &s;teps led to a magnificent tomb; above it he &s;aw a picture repre&s;enting a woman with a child in her lap. Alexis, &s;truck with all the&s;e things, had no doubt of the portraits being tho&s;e of the per&s;ons laid in the tomb. But what place could it be? Who was he that conducted him to it? His guide had di&s;ap|peared, he was alone, &s;hut up, and nobody came to let him out.&mdash;Alexis began to repent of his too great con|fidence, when, lo, a door opens&mdash;a venerable old man appears&mdash;Heaven! can he believes his own eyes?&mdash;it is Candor&mdash;Candor him&s;elf! O earth open, and let the unhappy Alexis hide his remor&s;e in thy bo&s;om!</P>
<P>Ungrateful, &s;aid the old man to him, ungrateful A|lexis! where are your promi&s;es? Where are your oaths? you was to have lived and died with us, and you fly, you for&s;ake us!&mdash;I &s;ee but too well the trial was above your &s;trength! I &s;u&s;pected the in&s;tability of your re&s;olutions.&mdash;You look at me; I can read in your eyes the &s;urpri&s;e which my di&s;cour&s;e cau&s;es. Let your a&s;toni&s;hment cea&s;e: Know, that the in&s;cription upon the trees of the fore&s;t, the &s;tranger, the letter the guide, in &s;hort, the whole intelligence you receiv|ed, was an ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ful contrivance of mine to &s;ound your

&s;entiments, and to mea&s;ure what degree of confidence I &s;hould repo&s;e in you. Now I am ready to fulfil your wi&s;hes; I know you, I know how much your friend&s;hip may be depended on. O treacherous Alex|is! you have opened my eyes but too much!&mdash;I &s;ee I have lo&s;t all in this world, as there is not one &s;ingle friend left to me.&mdash;Ah! my father, cried Alexis, throwing him&s;elf at his feet, ah! my generous bene|factor! yes, you &s;peak the truth, it was a trial too hard for my heart.&mdash;But did you know what conflicts and torments I endured! Ah! pardon me, and be per&s;uaded that it wanted nothing le&s;s than filial ten|derne&s;s that could balance that you have in&s;pired me with.</P>
<P>Candor was going to reply, when a door opened&mdash;it is Germain, it is Clara, who came to load the un|fortunate Alexis with their reproaches, already morti|fied with tho&s;e of the old man. The youth, &s;en&s;ible of his error, embraces their knees, bedews them with his tears, dete&s;ts his faults, and expre&s;&s;es his repent|ance with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of contrite feeling, that the fa|ther and daughter are forced to pity, to indulge and to do him ju&s;tice; for be it as it will, they were &s;en|&s;ible that Alexis had done but his duty in following the in&s;tinct of nature, that he le&s;t them in hopes to &s;ee his father again. An exce&s;s of virtue had made him guilty of ingratitude, and nature was his apology, Candor could not tell him his real way of thinking, &s;en&s;ible that the trial he had put him to was too ardu|ous, and that his very tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion made his eulogi|um; he embraced him therefore, and promi&s;ed to forget all. He then bade him to be &s;eated on the &s;teps of the tomb, and gave the &s;ame order to his daughter and Germain, and began the following di&s;|cour&s;e, which was an introduction to relate his ad|ventures:</P>
<P>"Alexis, if I &s;ent Germain to fetch you into the cavern of the fore&s;t; if he has been your guide hither without your being able to know him; in &s;hort, if I receive you for the fir&s;t time in this di&s;mal place, it is merely to di&s;clo&s;e a great de&s;ign which I have conceiv|ed, and to exact from your arm a vengeance, which

<P>SOTRY OF DORANCE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE HUSBAND A CONFIDANT OF HIS RIVAL.</HEAD>
<P>MY name is Dorance: my father was pre&s;ident of the Parliament of Grenoble, a &s;acred body, a mo&s;t honorable body, which has at all times given proof of firmne&s;s and ju&s;tice. An infant yet he &s;ent me to Paris, to make my &s;tudies under the tuition of a governor, as prudent as enlightened. It was in the collage of Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vais, where I unfortunately made the acquaintance of a traitor, the chevalier Duverly. Like me, young, bri&s;k, and fiery, his temper bore &s;o much re&s;emblance to mine, that, in a little time, we became &s;o intimate, that we could hardly be &s;eparated for one moment. He was an orphan, and his education en|tru&s;ted to the care of a guardian, who was to re&s;tore him his whole property when he &s;hould come to be of age.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="030364_0085_0FE5D21B450E72E8">
I &s;hall not expatiate upon the particulars of our in|timacy, nor the circum&s;tances which cemented it: it will be &s;ufficient for you to know, that upon leaving the college, where we had &s;tudied the <HI>humanities</HI> toge|ther, I reque&s;ted him to come and &s;pend &s;ome time with me at Grenoble at my father's hou&s;e, to whom I had many times wrote in a very flattering manner, about my friend's conduct, and al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed a de|&s;ire of getting more particular knowledge of him. Duverly at that time complied with an invitation, that quite charmed him: he loved me, or I had at lea&s;t no rea&s;on to think to the contrary: but his pa&s;&s;ions were &s;oon to operate a change in his perfidious heart, and to infect it with the &s;perm of all vices.</P>
<P>My father, who was kind and generous, received Duverly with great cordiality, and made him the of|fer to make his hou&s;e his home as long as he plea&s;ed. Duverly gratefully accepted his propo&s;al, and I return|ed thanks to my father. The latter &s;oon became &s;o fond of my friend as to blazen forth his merits with|out re&s;erve, and to make him, in every thing, the pat|tern of my conduct: we both &s;tudied the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, for which Duverly manife&s;ted more di&s;po&s;i|tion and ta&s;te than my&s;elf. He became al&s;o daily more grave and &s;erious. He had no more for me that confidence, nor made tho&s;e friendly effu&s;ions which I &s;o often experienced from him in his youth; in a word, I found him more re&s;erved and deliberate. Whatever alarmed me in his conduct; whatever I con|&s;idered as an evident change in his friend&s;hip to me, my father looked upon as an energy of mind, and a di&s;cretion of character entitled to his admiration. Be|hold, &s;aid he, often to me, behold your friend! he &s;hows not that levity &s;o con&s;picuous in your character; he is grave, rea&s;onable, thinking, and &s;olid. Endeavor to pre&s;erve always his friend&s;hip, and to follow his advice, for I am certain he wi&s;hes you well. I li&s;tened to my father, and it being congenial to me, that he could not mi&s;lead me with regard to Duverly my e&s;teem for the latter heightened, and I tried every thing in my power to re-obtain his confidence, which I thought I had forfeited by my &s;ailings.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="030364_0086_0FE5D21C27647CE8">
My father was very intimate with an old barone&s;s, who&s;e name was Myr&s;ange: &s;he was the widow of an officer of hor&s;e, and a few years &s;ince came to live at Grenoble with her only child, an adorable charming young lady, whom I could not &s;ee without emotion. My father, my friend and I, were u&s;ed to &s;pend the evening at the barone&s;s's hou&s;e, and the too lovely Adela made every day &s;o great a progre&s;s in my af|fections, that I &s;oon was able to di&s;cern the nature of my &s;entiments. I made this confidence to Duverly, who, &s;urpri&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed, received my avowal with &s;uch a kind of indignation as intimidated me from making further confidence. What, &s;aid he, do you love Mi&s;s Myr&s;ange? You&mdash;only think, Dorance? Think that &s;he is but a &s;ort of adventurer, who&s;e fam|ily and property are equally unknown to every body. She and her mother, I grant you, make a tolerable figure in this town; but whence come they? Who are they? it is three years &s;ince they have re&s;ided here; is that enough to know well per&s;ons, who perhaps have been bani&s;hed or expudiated? Open your eyes, Do|rance, acknowledge your folly; your father will never con&s;ent to it, believe me. No, he will never con&s;ent: I know him. He will, I &s;uppo&s;e, make enquiries, and &s;hould they not prove &s;atisfactory, you know your&s;elf the con&s;equence; in other re&s;pects he repo&s;es great tru&s;t in me: and if he a&s;ks my advice, in faith, I will be candid with you, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent it if you choo&s;e, yet, I &s;hall never give my opinion in favor of &s;uch a match. O heaven, what, Duverly&mdash;no; depend upon it: I pro|fe&s;s too much attachment to your well being, not to &s;uffer you to throw your&s;elf blindly and headlong into a precipice; the day would come, when you would reproach me with having promoted your ruin. My ruin, by all means; have not you dived into the cha|racter of that little body? Oh, I know her better than you, I can &s;wear; fir&s;t of all I believe &s;he is a haughty, imperious, &s;landering coquet. She has wit, I won't deny her that; but a deceitful, malicious, and &s;arca&s;tic wit, you your&s;elf know it. My dear Dorance is it po&s;&s;ible; ah, did you know how painful this confe&s;&s;ion&punc; of your's is to me, painful on your account; for were

you not my friend, it would be very indifferent to me, whether you have her or another. Come, promi&s;e me to follow my advice, and to conquer a fooli&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;hould never have ro&s;e in your heart.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e of Duverly a&s;toni&s;hed me to &s;uch a degree that I was at a lo&s;s to make a reply&mdash;I re|mained motionle&s;s, my heart was heavy; I was going, I believe, to &s;hed tears, when my father by his entering the apartment, interrupted our conver&s;ation, and took us with him to the court, where a cau&s;e highly inter|e&s;ting was to be pleaded; it was a couple who had married by inclination and without the con&s;ent of their parents: &s;ix months having pa&s;t, they became equally odious to one another, and &s;ued for a divorce. They made u&s;e of as many invectives as they formerly had made of tender and pious expre&s;&s;ions, and adduced in their behalf facts &s;o attrocious, as would have provok|ed the mo&s;t indelicate ear.</P>
<P>This &s;uit &s;truck me with horror, and Duverly, who perceived it, was plea&s;ed to add to my confu&s;ion, by pu&s;hing me at every quotation made by the coun&s;ellors, and expatiating with a low voice, upon the dangers of an ill-concerted marriage, which each of the couple depicted with equal energy.</P>
<P>Upon my return, I made the mo&s;t cruel reflections I did not &s;u&s;pect my friend of any &s;ecret motive to op|po&s;e my pa&s;&s;ion: moreover, my father e&s;teemed him much, and entertained the mo&s;t flattering notions of his &s;pirit and judgment: this was a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for me to re&s;pect him blindly.</P>
<P>Of all the fears Duverly had cau&s;ed me, none &s;eem|ed to me well founded; they were confined to vague &s;u&s;picions, without proofs, and of no alarming nature. What could I think of Duverly; He had appeared much moved at the confidence I made him of my pa&s;&s;ion: was it his concern for me, which&mdash;Oh yes, it was doubtle&s;s his concern, his friend&s;hip alone, which made him &s;peak to me. He was perhaps too timid, too prying into futurity; but all this reflects honor upon his heart; he was attached to me: he loved and re&s;pected my father, and was afraid le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ee unfortunate, &s;ome day, the family he cheri&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="030364_0088_0FE5D222723499A0">
I did abide by the&s;e reflections, and intended to &s;tudy Mi&s;s Myr&s;ange's character, and to renounce her hand, if ever I &s;hould di&s;cover in it the faults he had pointed out.</P>
<P>My father, however, frequently a&s;ked what I thought of Adela? I dared not to di&s;clo&s;e to him my real &s;en|timents on that head, le&s;t they &s;hould kindle his wrath. One day he explained h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;elf to me in a more di&s;tinct manner.

That you go to Paris to &s;tudy law, to receive in&s;tructions, and enable your|&s;elf to take the function of my charge, which I &s;hall not re&s;ign but in favor of that marriage. To go to Paris, my father! Could not I &s;tudy here as well as in Paris? Undoubtedly, but there is no place like Paris for young people to get in&s;tructed. Be&s;ides, I will recommend you to my be&s;t friend, Mr. de Calenzieux; he is a coun&s;ellor of parliament, and will perhaps take better care of your education than I can do; he is an old &s;enator, replete with genius and knowledge: go to him, my &s;on, go to draw from him his advice, that prudence and wi&s;dom &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to him who is to be the judge of his equals: and as you are to &s;ucceed in office, give me the &s;atisfaction to think, when I de&s;cend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he grave, that I leave my fellow citizens a virtuous and equitable magi&s;trate.

I embraced my father, and retired with the greate&s;t joy. I was however determined not to mention any thing about the project of my marriage to Duverly, fearing he may try to alter my father's mind, and I only infor|med him of our intended journey to Paris. I perceived that this news was highly vexatious to him; he turned pale, oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ure for &s;ome time, and when he made me perceive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he began to feel the weight of the links of our friend&s;hip, my father, much occupi|ed that day, had only time to &s;ay a few words to him&punc; he reque&s;ted him to accompany me to Paris, and to be my Mentor. My dear Duverly, &s;aid he&punc; you are a man of &s;ound and &s;olid parts, be vigilant over my &s;on, grant him always your friend&s;hip and your advice, which I command him to follow and to re&s;pect as mine own. Let him pay attention to you, and he will accompli&s;h all my wi&s;hes. Duverly an&s;wered only &s;tammering; I ob&s;erved him to be downca&s;t that whole day. At night we went to take our leaves of the barone&s;s and her daughter: the latter gave me a very cold reception, ca&s;t down her eyes, and I thought &s;he had been weeping. I paid her a compliment which &s;he did not return: I pre&s;&s;ed her hand without her &s;eeming to be moved. Her coldne&s;s affected me; I could ea&s;ily di&s;cover that &s;he did not love me; an involuntary blu&s;h diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over my face, and I let drop &s;ome tears. The mother, who perceived my perplexity, endeavored to allay it: &s;he opened her arms, and called me her &s;on.

<P>Duverly made no an&s;wer to this: he had a relap&s;e of his melancholy, and I was &s;orry to &s;ee him in &s;uch a &s;ituation; as for his health, having been wor&s;e for &s;ome time, it was true he had no &s;leep, he could not eat, and fell into a &s;tate of languor, which would bring on a dangerous di&s;order.</P>
<P>It was not long before it happened. We had now been two months at the hou&s;e of the coun&s;ellor, when Duverly was taken ill.

Judge what impre&s;&s;ion this report made upon me. I who loved Duverly, believed to po&s;&s;e&s;s his confidence! he concealed his grief from me.

<P>Duverly upon this, prepared to dige&s;t in his head the little fable he was going to relate. Alas, my friends, had he then unravelled to me the truth, all would have been over: I would have made him welcome to Adela's hand; I would have made that effort, and not have &s;uf|fered a &s;eries of misfortunes, of which he was the &s;ole author, and which never will cea&s;e but with my death.</P>
<P>Know then, &s;aid he, that the fir&s;t day of our arrival at Grenoble, I paid a vi&s;it to a relation of the name of Mrs. des Roches. I never mentioned that lady before, becau&s;e &s;he is the only &s;ource of my unfortunate adven|ture, and I&mdash;he&s;itated to let you into any fatal &s;ecret. I met at her hou&s;e with a re&s;pectable old man, who came there upon a vi&s;it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h his daughter, a girl of about &s;ix|teen: no, my friend, thou ha&s;t never &s;een &s;o much al|lurement, brown (ob&s;erve, my children, that Adela was fair) brown, &s;prightly, replete with wit, graces, and accompli&s;hments; I could not &s;ee her without falling de&s;perately in love.

<P>Mrs. des Roches made me al&s;o the confidant of many other circum&s;tances: the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me was to hear that Ro&s;ina came every day quite alone to &s;ee her, and &s;taid for whole hours.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE STORY OF DORANCE CONTINUED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the night previous to our departure from Gre|noble, a departure, which you will ea&s;ily con|ceive, has grieved me much&mdash;I &s;aw her. "My dear Duverly," &s;aid &s;he, melting in tears, "all is over, we are wretched for ever!&mdash;My father has given me formal notice, that I mu&s;t re&s;olve to be the colonel's in a twelvemonth&mdash;that very man whom I dete&s;t,

whom I abhor!"&mdash;"In a twelvemonth!" "Yes, be|cau&s;e the young man is gone to make a campaign, and is to be married to me upon his return." "Ah my Ro&s;ina, what a blow!"&mdash;"Cruel indeed, Duverly, but I am under the controul of a mother, and &s;he mu&s;t be obeyed." She mu&s;t be obeyed! Conceive Dorance, only conceive my grief! Your father then reque&s;ted me to accompany you to Paris: I could not re&s;i&s;t his de&s;ire; I &s;et out, but I leave you to think, whether I would not have preferred &s;taying at Grenoble! my rival was not there; I might have been a whole year with my charming Ro&s;ina, I would have been at liber|ty to &s;ee her every day at Mrs. des Roches'; Ah how happy would have been my lot!" Duverly was &s;ilent for a moment, though the confidence he had ju&s;t made, really wounded my feelings, and made me con&s;ider Mrs. des Roches as a vile, de&s;picable woman. I I would not, by delivering my true &s;entiments, aggra|vate my friend's &s;uffering condition. He then con|tinued as follows:</P>
<P>"At my departure from Grenoble, Ro&s;ina promi&s;ed to write to me and I have actually received a letter of her's a fortnight ago. It is this letter, Dorance which has given me a mortal blow. Here it is: I &s;hall read it to you&punc; and from it you will judge all the extent of my mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>I did not, my children, know Adela's hand writing. Duverly who was &s;ure of that, ri&s;ked nothing to &s;hew it me: but he took care not to let me peru&s;e it, as he had a mind to change &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, which would have otherwi&s;e undeceived me.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The expre&s;&s;ions which Duverly changed in reading Adela's letter, are printed in italics.</NOTE> He began, there|fore, to peru&s;e it very &s;lowly, for fear of making a blunder:</P>
<P>"Pardon me, my dear Duverly, for not having written &s;ooner. My <HI>father</HI> is teazing me continually; and &s;ince the <HI>Colonel's</HI> departure, <HI>he</HI> does hardly give me a minute's time to &s;ee Mrs. des Roches. But, O fre&s;h misfortune! did you only know what &s;acrifice is exacted from poor <HI>Ro&s;ina!</HI> My <HI>father</HI> is ab&s;olutely de|termined

Oh, let me often hear of you, my gentle friend, there is no other comfort on earth for <HI>Ro&s;ina.</HI>"</P>
<P>"This letter, (continued Duverly) this cruel letter, which informs me that my dear Ro&s;ina is to be &s;hut up, for a twelvemonth in an ob&s;cure retreat, where I find it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me, if the event takes place, to write to her; this fatal letter has troubled my &s;en&s;es, the ague has inflamed my blood, and a furious phren|&s;y quite &s;hook my brains; this, Dorance, this is the real cau&s;e of my di&s;ea&s;e."</P>
<P>When he had done &s;peaking, I remarked &s;uch fire in his eyes, as made me &s;en&s;ible that it was not &s;ea&s;onable then to give him advice. Neverthele&s;s he &s;tood in need of the be&s;t of advice; for, what could be the aim of his pa&s;&s;ion for an object which was unknown to me? and that Mrs. des Roches, who made them&s;elves &s;ub|&s;ervient to &s;o &s;hameful an intrigue; Oh, that charac|ter was odious and indignant to me. Nay, had I known that my Adela was the object in que&s;tion; that the letter which had been read to me was from Adela; that the colonel and pretended rival was my&s;elf&mdash;great God, what would have become of me! but his fable was &s;o well conceived, &s;o well di&s;gui&s;ed; and as yet, he had &s;poke &s;o ill of Mi&s;s Myr&s;ange, that I thought &s;he could not be the per&s;on. I had even not the lea&s;t idea of it in my mind; and, had I not explained it, my children, you would not have gue&s;&s;ed better than I did then. As to Mrs. des Roches, &s;he was no rela|tion of Duverly, as he gave out, but one of the&s;e v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olent go betweens, who&s;e only plea&s;ure is to hatch plots, and with whom we meet with every where to promote di&s;order. And yet, I will not have you be|lieve that her hou&s;e was a place of debauchery, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n|ly a place mo&s;t convenient for lovers who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;hort. Mrs. des Roches was a woman of &s;econd hand principles, willing to &s;erve in all intrigues the intent of which did not, to a certain point affect her delicacy. My father and the barone&s;s were perfectly ignorant of
<PB N="93" REF="030364_0095_0FE5D2475B32BCF0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he acquaintance Adela had contracted with that wo|man. It was Duverly who had appointed her that rendezvous, whither &s;he made it convenient to repair, to enjoy the company of her gallant.</P>
<P>All the&s;e particulars, my children, I unluckily heard but long afterwards; but I was obliged to expo&s;e them to you, in order to &s;hew how much I have been deceived. Grant me your whole attention, you &s;hall &s;ee the mo&s;t perfidious, and as well framed a plot as ever entered the head of man, to betray the good faith of his equals.</P>
<P>"My friend," &s;aid I to Duverly, "your &s;ituation is very cruel! you are now &s;en&s;ible that love is not ea&s;i|ly controuled, and you can no longer blame me for harboring that pa&s;&s;ion, for adoring, I &s;ay, the charm|ing Adela, in &s;pite of your wife per&s;ua&s;ions, and the faults you find in her." "Do you love her &s;till?" &s;aid he, with a kind of empha&s;is&mdash;"Yes, you do, I feel it but too well! and, although this objection of your af|fection would never have made any impre&s;&s;ion upon me, yet, as you ob&s;erve, love knows no controul! My dear friend, you &s;ee I am not in a condition to write; will you favor me to write the an&s;wer to this letter? I will dictate it: take pen and ink&mdash;oblige me in this! you cannot refu&s;e a dying friend!" I he&s;itated for &s;ome time how I was to act: but his entreaties&mdash;he was dying&mdash;what could I do? I placed a table clo&s;e to his bed-&s;ide, and he dictated to me the following let|ter:</P>

<P>"When the term of my &s;uffering &s;hall be pa&s;t, when heaven &s;hall have re&s;tored my health, I intend going directly to Grenoble, I&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here I interrupted him to a&s;k what he meant by this, but he begged me to go on, and he would explain afterwards the phra&s;e that made me &s;top.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall go to Mrs. des Roches, in who&s;e hou&s;e I mean to hide my&s;elf for &s;ome time. There I &s;hall &s;ee you, there I &s;hall &s;wear a thou&s;and times, the mo&s;t con&s;tant attachment. O my charming love!&mdash;This hope gives me a new life. My &s;ufferings vani&s;h!&mdash;I think on you, I &s;uffer no more!"</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Duverly u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavors to &s;ign his name in a legible manner: I then folded up and &s;ealed the letter, when he de&s;ired me to put upon it the following direction:</P>
<P>"A Madame, Madam des Roches, Rue Perrierre, Grenoble."</P>
<P>One might have &s;aid the balm of comfort had been poured into his brea&s;t: his eyes became a little &s;erene, his cheeks flu&s;hed with the blooming tokens of health, and he pre&s;&s;ed my hand in a manner expre&s;&s;ive of &s;entiment. "My friend," &s;aid he, "This is not the only favor I have to beg of you. It is in your power to re&s;tore me to life; but you mu&s;t pledge your word of honor to perform what I &s;hall require. Suffer me to return to Grenoble: I &s;hall hide my&s;elf; I &s;hall &s;ee my Ro&s;ina and be happy! You will therefore write to your father, to let him know that I am much bet|ter; that we will always do bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual, &amp;c. &amp;c. I will even &s;end letters for him, and which you will enclo&s;e in your own. My friend, re&s;tore me to life, as it will co&s;t &s;o little.</P>
<P>This project excited my indignation, which I expre&s;|&s;ed by a plain refu&s;al. Had you but &s;een the traitor weep &s;igh and &s;upplicate! he even fainted; and I was afraid it would be his la&s;t. "Wretch!" &s;aid I with|in my&s;elf, what a pa&s;&s;ion! what a phrenzy! Alas!

he is a madman who mu&s;t be taken care of again&s;t his own &s;elf! But were my father to di&s;cover him at Grenoble! were he to detect me as an impo&s;tor!&mdash;I expo&s;e my&s;elf to his anger! well, I will fall down at his feet, and de&s;cribe the condition my friend was in: I &s;hall confe&s;s my weakne&s;s, and he will grant me his pardon. Be&s;ides, Duverly is not my &s;lave, he has a right to act as he plea&s;es!&mdash;And what right have I to hinder him? Well, imprudent as it will be of me, my imprudence will &s;ave his life, it will re&s;tore my friend! Yes, Duverly," exclaimed I "Yes, I will do all to &s;erve you; only live, and let this be my re|ward."</P>
<P>Here the patient embraced me; he wept, laughed, was moved, and fell a&s;leep. I left him at day break, and jealous of keeping my word, went immediately to carry the letter to the po&s;t-office.</P>
<P>Don't you admire my complai&s;ance? Oh! we are not come to the point yet; you will &s;ee me act a part&mdash;a part that will make me blu&s;h all my life time: it proves my imprudence and my fooli&s;hne&s;s:&mdash;but I mu&s;t go on.</P>
<P>The chevalier got well in about a week. It is u&s;e|le&s;s for me to tell you how often, during that time he talked of his love, and the plea&s;ures he was going to enjoy at Grenoble! At la&s;t, impatient to wait for his full and perfect recovery, he embraced me and de|parted, informing the coun&s;ellor, that he was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate in Auvergne, to which he had &s;ucceeded by a legal right of inherit|ance; and that his ab&s;ence &s;hould not exceed two months at furthe&s;t.</P>
<P>"It would be to no purpo&s;e," &s;aid he "for you to inform Mr. Dorance, the father, of my departure; for he, having entru&s;ted me with the conduct of his &s;on, might be offended at my lo&s;ing &s;ight of him for &s;ome time; but he is no longer a child; and moreo|ver, in what hou&s;e, &s;ir,&mdash;in what hou&s;e more re&s;pec|tible than your's could he be?

<P>A long period of time pa&s;&s;ed, before I heard of him; I received at la&s;t the following letter two months after his departure:</P>
<P>"Can you believe it, my friend! I am the happie&s;t of mortals!

"I cannot conclude this without &s;peaking of your Adela. They &s;ay &s;he changes every day in the mo&s;t &s;ingular manner; and is torn by a grief who&s;e &s;ource is unknown.

Adieu,&mdash;reflect."</P>
<P>The peru&s;al of this epi&s;tle put me to the blu&s;h, for the part I had acted in this intrigue. "Yes," &s;aid I "it is I who am the author of that crime! it is I; had I not con&s;ented to Duverly's &s;ecret departure, would he have &s;een Ro&s;ina, would he have been able to &s;educe her youth and virtue?

It behoves me to bury it in the deepe&s;t oblivion, and repent all my life of a conduct equally di&s;graceful to the dictates of honor and virtue."</P>
<P>I an&s;wered Duverly's letter, but in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner; I made him &s;en&s;ible of his wrongs, and the ba&s;ene&s;s of the part he had made me act. I de&s;ired him to look out for another confidant, and concluded with conjuring him never to mention again an intrigue in which I was a&s;hamed to have been in&s;trumental.</P>
<P>What effect this &s;evere letter had upon him I &s;hall not decide. During four months I never heard of him, and at the expiration of that time, I had the mi&s;|fortune to receive a letter from the barone&s;s, bringing the bad tidings of my father's death.</P>
<P>I made the utmo&s;t di&s;patch to Grenoble, where I found every body belonging to my father's family in mourning and con&s;ternation.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="030364_0100_0FE5D250EE17ED40">
I had only &s;ome very di&s;tant relations in that town, and was re&s;olved to leave it, as &s;oon as I &s;hould have obtained Adela's hand, which her mother, jealous of the promi&s;e &s;he had made my father, was always di&s;|po&s;ed to grant me.</P>
<P>I hoped to find Duverly prepared to con&s;ole me, and to &s;hare my grief! Judge of my a&s;toni&s;hment when I could not get the lea&s;t intelligence of him. I went to Rue Perrierre, to that Mrs. des Roches, where I knew he lodged, and to my utmo&s;t &s;urprize, was informed that Mrs. des Roches had left town a week ago, and that the place &s;he had cho&s;en for her re&s;idence was un|known. I had not the lea&s;t doubt of Duverly and his infamous accomplices having carried off the unfor|tunate Ro&s;ina, and that the former would not let me know the matter, for fear of incurring my father's di&s;|plea&s;ure. But, what often puzzled me was, that nobody at Grenoble had known Ro&s;ina or her father. Indeed, not knowing the old man's name, I could not make proper inquiries about the family.</P>
<P>Thus my friend was gone: he had for&s;aken me; he had broken the fir&s;t ties of our friend&s;hip! I for &s;ome time regretted him, but &s;oon after con&s;idering his perver&s;e morals, I made an effort to forget him, and &s;ucceeded; &s;o true is it that vice mu&s;t be hateful to hone&s;t and virtuous hearts, and that with them it out|weighs all other con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>In the mean while, I &s;aw every day my Adela, who was faithful to the portrait Duverly had drawn of her in his la&s;t; her mother, however, before whom &s;he con&s;trained her&s;elf, in&s;i&s;ted on her giving me her hand; it was my father's la&s;t will; I was determined to receive it; yet without&mdash;love! This pa&s;&s;ion weak|ened in me every day, and I acted barely with pa&s;&s;ive obedience to the barone&s;s, becau&s;e I fore&s;aw the aby&s;s which threatened my ruin. I often attempted to try Adela's &s;entiments towards me, and I found, that though &s;he had no liking to me, &s;he was not again&s;t accepting my hand. At la&s;t, being per&s;uaded to mar|riage on all &s;ides, when the fatal day fixed for the ceremony was come, I conducted mi&s;s to the alter, and brought her back without joy as without &s;adne&s;s;

but with a &s;entiment of inquietude which I could not account for. Arrived at home, my &s;pou&s;e demanded to &s;peak in private with me and her mother; we com|plied with her reque&s;t, and &s;aw her with &s;urpri&s;e throw her&s;elf at our feet, and make the following &s;ingular &s;peech: "Mother, you have forced me to marry this gentleman! you know the &s;truggles I went through, and how often you have rejected me from your bo&s;om; give me, for heaven &s;ake, time to know him, to ac|knowledge his real merit, and to render my&s;elf wor|thy of the tenderne&s;s he conde&s;cends to have for me! I only beg leave for two months to retire to Mrs. Reig|ny's, my aunt, at St. Marcellin. There I &s;hall have lei&s;ure to deliberate better; there I will do every en|deavor to de&s;erve the affection and love of the man who merits to find more gratitude in me; Oh, my mother, and you, &s;ir, grant me this favor! I beg it on my knees! Alas, can you deny me?"</P>
<P>The barone&s;s was going to load her daughter with reproaches and threats; but I was &s;o moved, the voice of candor appealed &s;o loud to my heart, that I thought it would be cruelty to refu&s;e &s;o &s;ingular a de|mand, which was nigh to have affected the life of the unfortunate Adela. Joining therefore my entreaties to her own, we at la&s;t obtained the mother's con&s;ent. At the &s;ame time, &s;he loaded her with cur&s;es and impre|cations, and &s;wore never to &s;ee her again. "Sir," added &s;he, "I have no farther rights upon her: do with her what you advi&s;e be&s;t: for my own part, I will no more hear of her; no, no more:&mdash;She is the &s;courge of my old age.</P>
<P>The barone&s;s &s;uddenly left the room, and would not even &s;o much as give her a letter for Mrs. Reigny. I was as much perplexed as my &s;pou&s;e: I &s;ent a tru&s;|ty &s;ervant with her, &s;he &s;tept quickly into the carriage with her woman, and arrived that very day at St. Marcellin. My &s;ervant returned the next day, with a letter from Adela, in which &s;he thanked me for the permi&s;&s;ion I had granted her, a&s;&s;uring me that a trait &s;o generous would never be era&s;ed from her memory, and that &s;he could already promi&s;e me the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE STORY OF DORANCE CONTINUED:</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THUS left a widower on the fir&s;t day of my mar|riage, I &s;taid another month at Grenoble, where I had the misfortune to lo&s;e the barone&s;s my mother in law. Her daughter's conduct, who&s;e notoriety was partly known to her, and perhaps the regret of having forced her to a compliance again&s;t her inclination, brought upon her a violent illne&s;s of which &s;he died; neither permitting my &s;pou&s;e to &s;ee her, nor forgiving her in her la&s;t moments. Being then tired of Grenoble, I determined to go to &s;ettle in Paris; but would fir&s;t go to St. Marcellin to &s;ee my &s;pou&s;e, and to per&s;uade her if po&s;&s;ible to accompany me. In con&s;equence of this, I informed her by a letter of her mother's death, of the de&s;ign I had formed, and concluded with beg|ging her kindly to receive my vi&s;it and to give me her con&s;ent to accompany me to Paris</P>
<P>Having &s;ent this letter, I &s;ettled &s;ome affairs at Grenoble, and &s;et out for St. Marcellin. It is time, my children, to make you acquainted with the conduct of my &s;pou&s;e, and the perfidious Duver&s;y.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner heard of my return to Grenoble, than he determined to leave the town that very in&s;tant, le&s;t he &s;hould excite my &s;u&s;picion. Moreover, my pre|&s;ence was a check to the frequent vi&s;its he paid to the culpable Adela. Much would he have been at a lo&s;s al&s;o to convince me of his intrigue with the pretended Ro&s;ina. Adela, therefore, with Mrs. des Roches and Duverly, having conjointly taken their mea&s;ures, it was agreed that the latter &s;hould go to re&s;ide at St. Marcellin, near Mrs. Reigny, a &s;i&s;ter of the the baron|e&s;s, and that Adela &s;hould adopt the above conduct with her mother and me. Mrs. des Roches an in&s;inu|ating artful woman, having, at her arrival at St. Mar|celin, changed her name, and gave out Duverly for her &s;on, and both of them became &s;o connected with Mrs. Reigny, that they &s;pent whole days in company of each other, and almo&s;t &s;lept under the &s;ame roof. A|dela came to increa&s;e that company, and told her aunt
<PB N="101" REF="030364_0103_0FE5D315018EFCA0">
how her mother had forced her to marry a man &s;he did not like, and our tempers being of a contradictory na|ture, and in oppo&s;ition to each other, &s;he had obtained leave to &s;pend &s;ome time at her hou&s;e till her repug|nance &s;hould be removed, and &s;he be decided to return to her hu&s;band. The good old aunt, ea&s;y and credu|lous, yielded to all their artifices, and introduced her niece to Mrs. de Ramond (the fictitious name adopted by Mrs. des Roches and her &s;on,) as to friends to whom &s;he profe&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t regard. Thus the&s;e contemp|tible wretches carried on their debauchery, even in the eye of a re&s;pectable aunt, who, far from gue&s;&s;ing the plot, granted them every liberty of meeting and con|ver&s;ing with one another.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all this, my letter created &s;ome confu&s;ion among the criminal triumvirate. Duverly made a pre|cipitate retreat, and my &s;pou&s;e (mu&s;t I tell it!) was in a very advanced &s;tate of pregnancy, betook her&s;elf to bed, and feigned all the &s;ymptoms of a violent di&s;order. I arrived at this juncture, and found the old aunt and the perfidious des Roches by her bed &s;ide. Alas, exclaim|ed the latter, who&s;e face I did not know, alas! the poor little woman, when &s;he heard of her mother's death, &s;he was &s;eized with a fever and phrenzy. My mother is dead, &s;aid &s;he, and &s;he died loading me with cur&s;es and imprecations! Oh heaven! can one be more unfortunate! In vain her aunt, my &s;on, and I endeavored to con&s;ole her: nothing, &s;ir, nothing could avail, but the news of your arrival. Shall I &s;ee my &s;pou&s;e again! &s;aid &s;he, Ah! may he forgive me, and I &s;hall die contented.</P>
<P>At this di&s;cour&s;e of the perfidious des Roches, I ap|proached the bed: dear Adela, &s;aid I to my &s;pou&s;e, you know I never intended to tyranize over you! You wi&s;hed to &s;pend &s;ome time at your aunts, I gave you my hearty con&s;ent. Now, &s;ince you have no mother, there remains only a hu&s;band, a tender, a faith|ful hu&s;band&mdash;deign to accompany him to Paris, where he intends to fix his re&s;idence, and be &s;ure that the care of con&s;ulting your happine&s;s &s;hall henceforth be his &s;ole and con&s;tant ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="030364_0104_0FE59AF005839F00">
Adela, affecting a feeble tone of voice, an&s;wered, that &s;he was highly &s;en&s;ible of her wrongs, that &s;he in|tended to make amends for them, but intreated my kindne&s;s to give her three months to indulge her grief at the lo&s;s of the deare&s;t of mothers, that &s;he a&s;ked &s;o much time to &s;urrender her&s;elf to my wi&s;h. It is no mere indifference which dictates that language! No, no, my dear Dorance, your behavior, your genero&s;ity, impre&s;&s;es the mo&s;t forcible conviction of my wrongs; They are great, and will I ever forgive them! De|part, dear hu&s;band, depart; in three months you &s;hall &s;ee again Adela, not the unju&s;t, ungrateful Adela, who received your hand with dread; but a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, ten|der, &s;en&s;ible &s;pou&s;e, who will think her life too &s;hort, to expiate the wrongs done to you.</P>
<P>You, my children, will perhaps think, that Adela did not &s;peak the language of her heart: yes, &s;he was &s;incere. My gentlene&s;s, my politene&s;s had moved her, &s;he repented of her crimes, and intended to live with me, according to the mo&s;t rigorous precept of decency and probity. It was now the eighth month of her pregnancy, &s;he longed to &s;ee me gone, &s;he feared to pub|li&s;h her &s;hame, and my di&s;honor! Alas! how &s;he wept! had you &s;een it, my children, &s;he would have excited your pity. I who was ignorant of her mo|tive, was moved to &s;uch a degree, that I advanced to con&s;ole and to embrace her. No, exclaimed &s;he, pu&s;h|ing me back, no, my too re&s;pectable hu&s;band, I am not worthy! my conduct towards you! Ah! pre&s;erve tho&s;e tender care&s;&s;es for happier times.</P>
<P>Des Roches, quite motionle&s;s at this &s;pectacle, did not know if Adela had &s;poken &s;incerely, acted the part of a &s;tage player; the old aunt dropt &s;ome tears, and was muttering quite low: Hum, poor couple! how loving! how moving they are! my dear nephew! My dear niece!&mdash;If Raymond was here!&mdash;With this cur&s;ed journey he lo&s;t the &s;pectacle, a be&s;t example!&mdash;He is a good young man; he will, I believe, have the &s;ame feelings for his wife: for I will &s;ee him married, &amp;c. &amp;c. Des Roches beckoned her repeatedly to be &s;ilent; and would with all her heart have wi&s;hed her to all the devils. Although I did not know this Raymond,
<PB N="103" REF="030364_0105_0FE5D2E6EB0156A0">
yet &s;he was afraid I &s;hould gue&s;s him. The guilty are always fearful and trembling le&s;t the lea&s;t &s;ign &s;hould di&s;cover their crimes. They will often &s;how by their anxiety what they are &s;o careful to keep con|cealed.</P>
<P>I &s;taid two days longer at St. Marcellin: my &s;pou&s;e, who had her di&s;order at her controul, made ha&s;te to recover, and having left her in good health, I &s;et out for Paris, where I arrived and took lodgings in the Rue Grenoble, St. Honore. A month after my ar|rival, I received the following letter from Duverly, which to me was no &s;mall object of &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Will you excu&s;e &s;o long a &s;ilence, my dear Do|rance, when I &s;hall have enumerated to you all the cau&s;es that have occa&s;ioned it? A few days before your father's death. Ro&s;ina's father di&s;covered my in|trigue with his daughter. After having loaded her with the &s;evere&s;t reproaches, he re&s;olved to leave Gre|noble, and to take lodgings at <HI>Bourg-d'Oy&s;ans,</HI> a place which you know is adjacent to this town. Mrs. des Roches brought me the news: I was thunder&s;truck!&mdash;The father threatened to kill me wherever he would find me. What could I do? De&s;pair almo&s;t overpow|ered my faculties, I propo&s;ed to my relation to travel, &s;he con&s;ented, and we &s;et off. I did not let you know it at that time, I was &s;o perplexed! You had forbidden me to mention any thing farther of my amours! Your &s;everity&mdash;a &s;eries of misfortunes! pardon, I pray, my &s;ilence: I break it off to conjure you to receive in your hou&s;e a wretched friend, who is &s;oon to go Paris to die&mdash;to break his heart. My Ro&s;ina is to marry the colonel in que&s;tion; but at this time&mdash;&s;he is&mdash;dare I tell it you&mdash;&s;he is pregnant,&mdash;the poor child! I don't know how to act, that her father may not find it out&mdash;indeed it drives me mad. A&s;&s;i&s;t me with your advice, it is the la&s;t favor of an unhappy friend, who does ac|knowledge his faults, and &s;wears never to be guilty a|gain, if you &s;uffer him to live near you, before your eyes, and fortified by your example.</P>
<P>"Direct under cover, at Mr. Pirlet's, <HI>Bourg d'Oy|&s;ans."</HI></P>

I peru&s;ed this letter &s;everal times, and pity re&s;umed her empire in my heart. I was going to let him know that he was welcome to my lodging, but I received a letter from my wife, purporting that her health was perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that the three months &s;he had fixed, appeared too long a period to be ab&s;ent from me&mdash;that &s;he would come to Paris in &s;ix weeks, and would make it her duty to &s;ee me happy.</P>
<P>This letter filled me with joy, and my tran&s;port had made me forget to &s;end Duverly an an&s;wer. One day when I had ju&s;t thought on him, my &s;ervant came to inform me that &s;ome pea&s;ant de&s;ired to &s;peak to me in&s;tantly. I made him come in, and a&s;ked what he wanted. The &s;tranger, without an&s;wering, deliv|ered me a letter, which I knew to come from Duver|ly.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Dear Dorance, how will you receive the reque&s;t of a favor I have to a&s;k of you! will you render me &s;o e&s;&s;ential a &s;ervice? Now&mdash;I am a father&mdash;Ro&s;ina is brought to bed of a mo&s;t beautiful little girl! Mr. Pir|let, my friend, went into the country with the old man: He left Ro&s;ina to the care of Mrs. Pirlet&mdash;During this I &s;hall &s;ay no more&mdash;but, after all, that child, it mu&s;t be concealed from the vigilant eye of its grand-father and the colonel, who is expected.&mdash;I have but one friend, to him I &s;end it&mdash;receive it, Dorance, receive the pledge of the mo&s;t tender love!&mdash;Give it a name, or if your heart, if your delicacy deny me what I re|que&s;t of your humanity, con&s;ign the babe to tho&s;e a&s;&s;y|lums open to tho&s;e victims of its age, whom indigence or jealou&s;y leave de&s;titute!

Do all for your friend&mdash;may he owe you more than his life&mdash;his happine&s;s!"</P>
<P>This &s;ingular propo&s;al quite affected me. "Where is that poor child?"&mdash;"Why, Mea&s;ter, we bring it in an our mare; it is below in that there yard."&mdash;"In my yard! good God, what will he have me do with it?

<P>I knew not what to do; when a woman entered my apartment; &s;he had a child, which &s;he rudely put into my arms. "There, good gemman, there it is, poor little thing&mdash;Can you be &s;o barbarous not to take it!" "What, I take it? it is not mine; it is nothing to me." Poor little chicken! it wept, it looked at me; (it was then a fortnight old.) I was touched with pity; I embraced the child. I looked at it. The woman that brought it was a nur&s;e; I kept her too.&mdash;"Mea&s;ter," &s;aid &s;he, "'tis a little girl; &s;he ar'nt been chri&s;ten'd though."

I followed this advice, and went to the rector of the pari&s;h, to whom I communicated my adventure, &s;uch as it had happened.

<P>Here Candor's narrative was interrupted by Clara, who threw her&s;elf in his arms, and, melting into tears, exclaimed, "Ah my father&mdash;Ah Sir&mdash;I know not what name to give you&mdash;I &s;ee but too well, I am that unfortunate child&mdash;O my God!&mdash;why did not you reject me&mdash;O heaven, what kindne&s;s, what genero&s;ity."

After my de|parture from St. Marcellin, &s;he loaded des Roches with the mo&s;t bitter reproaches.

<P>Des Roches, quite a&s;toni&s;hed, informed Duverly of this change: the latter flattered him&s;elf to regain Ade|la's heart; but it was in vain: my &s;pou&s;e, quite inflexi|ble, threatened to kill him if he ever &s;hould attempt to appear before her. The only favor &s;he begged of him was to &s;end the child to her hu&s;band at Paris. "I &s;hall &s;ee it," &s;aid &s;he, "that unfortunate offspring of my guilt; I &s;hall bring it up, and its pre&s;ence will always remind me of my error; and point out the conduct I ought to adopt towards the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and mo&s;t generous of men." Duverly con&s;ented; but he could never prevail on Adela to permit him to come and live with us. That woman, who&s;e affection to this wretch was changed into hatred, forbad him preromptorily, threatening to di&s;clo&s;e all to her hu&s;band, &s;hould he ev|er be &s;o imprudent as to di&s;turb the peace of their hou&s;e. Duverly, in con&s;equence having made choice of a nur&s;e, and a tru&s;ty confidante, &s;ent me the infant as mentioned above; and too much per&s;uaded of Adela's carrying her project into execution, he voluntarily exiled him&s;elf without writing to me.</P>
<P>There was but one thing that puzzled me at Paris; I knew not how to pre&s;ent the child to my &s;pou&s;e without exciting on her part, &s;ome injurious &s;u&s;picions again&s;t me.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE STORY OF DORANCE CONCLUDED.&mdash;ALEXIS LEAVES THE COTTAGE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THUS I lived twelve months with my &s;pou&s;e in the &s;weete&s;t intimacy. Little Clara was growing apace; Adela loved her dearly, and gave her leave to call her mama, and often called her daughter. For my own part, I made u&s;e of the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions to the child, who was beloved by every one. She gave tokens of bright parts, and a good heart; we re&s;olved to begin her education and to put her in a convent. At that time my wife pre&s;ented me with a &s;on. A &s;on, forgive me if my heart &s;ighs at this name&mdash;Alas, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my wounds. Here begins the career of my attrocities: O my children, how you will dete&s;t me.</P>
<P>I had no profe&s;&s;ion, and was a father: this &s;acred title rouzed my emulation. I was informed that the per&s;on who had purcha&s;ed my father's charge had &s;ince died, and that the precedency was again vacant. Am|bitious of occupying a po&s;t in which my ance&s;tors had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, I imparted my de&s;ign to my &s;pou&s;e. She would not, at fir&s;t, give her con&s;ent; un|doubtedly becau&s;e &s;he would not live in a town which would always call to her remembrance her tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons. Yet, after all, &s;he con&s;ented, and we &s;et out. My &s;pou&s;e nur&s;ed her &s;on, we took him with us, and went to &s;ettle at Grenoble; but it was decreed that it &s;hould not remain long my abode.</P>
<P>We had now been a week at Grenoble; I was bu&s;y in courting the head magi&s;trates for the object of my

ambition, when I received one day a large parcel in form of a letter. A cold &s;weat came forth from my pores, and &s;et all my body on a tremble; a fatal pre|&s;entiment &s;eemed to forewarn me not to open the papers. I was alone: judge of my de&s;pair, upon reading the&s;e words.</P>

<P>I left the room quite furious!&mdash;I made enquiries: &s;ome per&s;ons pointed out to me as nearly as they could, the road which the carriage had pur&s;ued; I mounted on hor&s;eback, and fled with the greate&s;t ra|pidity. At twilight I reached the entrance of the fo|re&s;t. A countryman &s;uppo&s;ing I looked for &s;ome|thing, calls out: "Is it not a carriage you want, &s;ir: look, it went that way."&mdash;I clapped &s;purs to my hor&s;e, and perceived at &s;ome di&s;tance in the middle of the road, a carriage which &s;eemed to &s;top; the more I ap|proached, the more I could di&s;tingui&s;h it: it is my own, my worthle&s;s &s;pou&s;e is in it, Germain whom I always thought &s;o faithful! He betrays me, he drives Adela&mdash;whither?&mdash;no doubt to her lover.&mdash;I approach clo&s;er to the carriage, which had overturned. Adela had left it, &s;he knows me, &s;he falls at my feet, &s;he pre|&s;ents her &s;on&mdash;O &s;cene of horror!&mdash;Dare I proceed?&mdash;No, perfidious woman, cried I, no pardon to a wretch!&mdash;I un&s;heathed my &s;word, and plunged it &s;e|veral times into the body of the unhappy woman and her infant!&mdash;Great God!&mdash;who in&s;pired me with &s;uch fury! Hell! yes, hell alone guided my arm. Germain runs, he has not time to di&s;arm me.&mdash;Trem|ble too for thy own &s;afety, thou wretch: O! my dear ma&s;ter, &s;he is not guilty.&mdash;But too much, replies Ade|la, with a dying voice weltering in her blood&mdash;yes, I de&s;erve my fate; but cruel man, what has thy &s;on done?&mdash;He is thy &s;on, and thou become&s;t his execu|tioner!&mdash;Is this my &s;on! dare&s;t thou &s;ay it?&mdash;Alas! heaven be my witne&s;s, I never &s;aw Duverly &s;ince I fir&s;t joined you at Paris! he has been in America ever &s;ince!&mdash;O heaven! can it be true:&mdash;Gracious God! let my innocence be known to him, and may he one day drop a tear upon the tomb of the unhappie&s;t of mothers!</P>

O mo&s;t cruel of hu&s;bands, of fathers! dete&s;t now your cruelty!&mdash;Know all&mdash;Adela, this morning came to me, Germain, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ave my life &s;ave thy ma&s;ter.&mdash;I have committed a horrid crime be|fore I married him. He has ju&s;t been informed of it, the conduct which I have &s;ince adopted, will not &s;uffice to &s;helter me from his ju&s;t re&s;entment.&mdash;Oh conduct me to &s;ome &s;acred a&s;ylum: give me time to di&s;arm his an|ger?&mdash;In vain did I repre&s;ent to her the dangers this proceeding would expo&s;e me to, her tears, her entrea|ties, (&s;he was almo&s;t at my feet;) and having heard that you was in pur&s;uit of us made me comply. I drove her as far as this fore&s;t, to conceal our&s;elves for &s;ome hours: but believe me &s;he was virtuous with you! Oh! I &s;wear, I &s;wear &s;he was virtuous.</P>
<P>De&s;pair &s;ucceeded the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow, I wept bitterly: Dear victims, &s;aid I, leaning on the poplar beneath which the&s;e two deplorable victims were lay|ing; ah, could you hear my voice; could I re&s;tore you to life at the expence of my own!&mdash;Ju&s;t God, could you permit a deed &s;o black, &s;o attrocious? Alas what cruelty, what infernal cruelty.</P>
<P>Favored by the &s;hades of night, Germain and I drag|ged the two corp&s;es to a neighboring cavern. There I &s;at down by them, and &s;wore not to leave them to my la&s;t breath. In vain Germain attempted to make me return to Grenoble; I was deaf to all his intreat|ies, and had it not been for the zeal of this faithful &s;ervant, I would have made away with a life, &s;tained by the mo&s;t abominable of crimes. Germain, &s;aid I, in a moment of calm, men have betrayed me; I will fly from them, I will inhabit this fore&s;t; here I &s;hall be with my wife and &s;on; here, far from all &s;oci|al intercour&s;e, I will deplore my crime and family. Germain con&s;ented, he pledged him&s;elf to keep the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ecrecy about this dreadful accident, and it was agreed, that, next day I &s;hould go to Grenoble,
<PB N="113" REF="030364_0115_0FE5D2E9CC305898">
to &s;ettle all my affairs, and to engage a clever and di&s;creet arti&s;t to erect this cottage, of which I my&s;elf had drawn the plan.</P>
<P>This hope circulated in my veins like the mo&s;t pre|cious balm: we &s;pent that night in the fore&s;t, and, after having &s;et by the remains of two beings &s;o dear to me, we &s;et out for town, in the &s;ame po&s;t chai&s;e, which had, the preceeding day, carried my &s;pou&s;e and &s;on. I waited immediately upon the Duke de&mdash;, then governor of Dauphiny, who was at that time at Grenoble: I informed him, that certain misfortunes, which I could not explain, had determined me to re|tire from the world, and for that rea&s;on I humbly &s;up|plicated his permi&s;&s;ion and leave to build a retreat in the fore&s;t of Chamborane. This nobleman, who had known me from my infancy, and loved me much, made u&s;e of all his rhetoric to di&s;&s;uade me from &s;o &s;ingular a project; but finding his advice would be to no purpo&s;e, he readily granted my reque&s;t and ad|ded to it another architect, a man of abilities and tri|ed fidelity, who &s;econded my project with the highe&s;t di&s;cretion, &s;o that the town, and all other adjacent places knew nothing of my undertaking. I ordered the fatal poplar, a witne&s;s to my barbarity, to be tran&s;planted into my garden, and you, my children, know it well; it is to this hour &s;tained with blood. Let us now turn our eyes, if po&s;&s;ible from this dread|ful picture!</P>
<P>While the cottage and its premi&s;es were building, I remained in the cavern, which contained the bodies of Adela and Julius. I had them embalmed, and put in a coffin, made of a very hard &s;ort of wood, lined on the in&s;ide with a kind of pitch, which kept out the air and humidity. It is the very &s;ame cavern in which Alexis to day &s;heltered him&s;elf from the &s;torm. A &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;age leading from this cave conducts to it, and every night I vi&s;it it to &s;hed tears! When the cottage was fini&s;hed, I procured all the nece&s;&s;ary furniture which you &s;o often &s;ee, and came to conclude my life within its walls.&mdash;I was but too &s;ure of Adela's innocence: among her papers I found a letter from Duverly dated &s;ome weeks before the perpetration of
<PB N="114" REF="030364_0116_0FE5D2A05C054378">
my crime, purporting that he had &s;ettled five years &s;ince, in the province of North-Carolina in America, and wi&s;hed con&s;tant happine&s;s might attend her, me, and his little Clara, whom he recommended to her maternal care: from this it appears, that Adela had not &s;een him &s;ince our re-union at Paris: thus I im|molated my own &s;on on the bo&s;om of his mother!&mdash;O inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of remor&s;e!</P>
<P>It is neverthele&s;s a plain fact that the perfidious Duverly intended to di&s;turb the peace of our family. Why did he &s;end Adela's letters, and unveil her crime?&mdash;Why would he blacken that unfortunate woman with the mo&s;t odious calumny; why feign to be on his death bed, while it was a mere fiction (as Mrs. Des Roches, by a note, has informed me &s;ince, that I had no occa&s;ion to trouble my&s;elf about Duverly, he being &s;ettled in North-Carolina) although it be true that the fatal letter was not of his own writing, yet he dictated it&mdash;it was a trait of blackne&s;s in that infernal villain to de&s;troy my peace and the honor of my &s;pou&s;e. He did it &s;eemingly, to be revenged on her, becau&s;e &s;he had entirely bani&s;hed him from her pre&s;ence. What light could I draw from this chaos of thought!&mdash;All my fury, all my re&s;entment, were kindled again&s;t Duverly&mdash;I conceived the mo&s;t bar|barous project; he has a daughter, &s;aid I, &s;he is in my power. She believes I am her father: let her grow in this belief&mdash;I will go to &s;eek Duverly in eve|ry part of the globe, I will re&s;tore him his daughter, but when I re&s;tore her, my dagger &s;hall pierce her a thou&s;and times in his own &s;ight!&mdash;Yes, my wife, yes, my &s;on; this is the vegeance decreed to your bloody manes. Duverly, who made me commit the greate&s;t outrage again&s;t nature, I will puni&s;h with the &s;ame blow.</P>
<P>I fetched Clara immediately from the convent, to live in the cottage with Germain and me. You have trembled, my children, at the phrenzy which mi&s;led my rea&s;on. Ah, I blu&s;h and will be a&s;hamed of it, all the days of my wretched life: Yes, Clara, behold your benefactor, he only brought you up to be his vic|tim; but now much has your &s;weetne&s;s, your lovely

temper, di&s;comfited his bloody de&s;ign;&mdash;ah forgive him! Your father is the cau&s;e of all my ills; him alone I do charge with all the weight of my hatred; but you &s;hall forever be the deare&s;t object of my ten|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>Alexis, you have now heard the &s;tory of my mi&s;|fortunes; they &s;eemed to excite your pity, prove it, then, in revenging my crime?&mdash;"Upon whom?"&mdash;"How can you a&s;k!"&mdash;"O heaven, upon Clara's father!" "has he ever proved him&s;elf her father? "O God, what a demand! The hand of Clara is the de&s;tined reward!"&mdash;"What do I hear," interrupted the latter.&mdash;"What, &s;ir, are you &s;o cruel as to promi&s;e my hand to the wretch who murders my father?&mdash;Cla|ra mu&s;t de&s;erve to expect of you &s;uch &s;entiments."&mdash;"Who is your father? is it a ba&s;e &s;educer who di&s;|honored your mother, or is it her true and generous hu&s;band, who received you as his child, who brought you up, and of who&s;e misfortunes your birth is the only cau&s;e?"&mdash;"Where am I," replied Clara, "O God! what an aby&s;s of crimes does &s;urround me! am I then born for crimes?"&mdash;"Germain," continues Dorance, "this is the period to execute our de&s;ign. Let us &s;pill tho&s;e drops of a blood devoted to my hatred, &s;prung from the veins of the mo&s;t inveterate of ene|mies!"&mdash;"Away, barbarous ruffians, how dare you?" "Clara," replied Dorance, "be docile, &s;econd my wi&s;hes, ah! I will not have thy life; thou art too dear to me, but leave me my vengeance, leave it me, it is my only trea&s;ure."</P>
<P>Clara, &s;inking under the weight of grief, remained motionle&s;s, her lovely head hung over her woe-fraught bo&s;om; &s;he was a prey to &s;ighs and &s;obs. The vin|dictive old man laid hold of the hand of Alexis, and &s;aid to him: Go, my &s;on, and &s;eek Duverly all over the world. To-morrow, when dawn u&s;hers in the fre&s;h morn, thou &s;halt &s;et out, and never return to this man&s;ion, but with the traitor's head&mdash;his head in hand&mdash;mark me: this is my command, this is the will of a friend, who has by his genero&s;ity proved a father to thee!</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="030364_0118_0FE5D2A1EF0AA210">
Alexis, trembling with indignation, could not ut|ter a word: Dorance and Germain ri&s;e, they take the coffin on their &s;houlders, and having given each of the young people a flambeau, they a&s;cend the &s;tairs of the cave, cro&s;s the garden, and let down their noble burden under the great poplar.</P>
<P>Night, with the thicke&s;t &s;able array, governed the fore&s;t. The light of the flambeaus having rou&s;ed the birds perching on the neighboring trees, they &s;uddenly cleave the air with anxious wings, fluttering a thou&s;and &s;ini&s;trous &s;hrieks, which were re-echoed ince&s;&s;antly by the bird of night.</P>
<P>Our four hermits having arrived at the great poplar tree; Dorance addre&s;&s;es them: Here, &s;aid he, here is the place where a de&s;perate hand plunged a dagger in|to the heart of a &s;pou&s;e and a &s;on!&mdash;Here is that bloo|dy &s;teel &s;till &s;tained with blood; the mo&s;t precious, the mo&s;t innocent blood! O my wife! thy head was lean|ing here, again&s;t the bark of this tree, here thou ha&s;t fallen, thy eyes looked tenderly on me, thou pre&s;&s;ed&s;t my hand and expired! Wilt thou forgive thy butcher? And thou, unhappy creature, that had &s;carce a vital &s;park: Julius, my poor little Julius, what ha&s;t thou done! Here they are, Clara; behold them, Alexis, in this coffin! They groan, I hear their voice! it calls for vengeance! You &s;hall be revenged, &s;acred a&s;hes! God &s;peaks to the heart of Alexis: he arms his hand! Clara her&s;elf will encounter him to avenge the cau&s;e of a mother, of a brother, and a generous benefactor! no, it is not thy &s;educer, O mo&s;t unfor|nate Adelia; it is not thy &s;educer who gave her life! it is thee, it is from thy bo&s;om &s;he received life! Oh! let her &s;ee thee! let her hear thy voice from the hol|low bier!&mdash;Be appea&s;ed unhappy family! Ah! you break my heart!</P>
<P>The old man threw him&s;elf upon the coffin. Clara falls down pro&s;trate, and both utter cries as would have moved the mo&s;t flinty heart! but what became of our young couple, when Dorance, opening the cof|fin, expo&s;ed to their &s;ight two embalmed mummies, covered with wounds? Clara reels and drops &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground: the old man burns &s;ome incen&s;e, covers

O Alexis, Alexis, will you di&s;appoint the hopes of my old age? Take this &s;teel, take it: make it pierce the perfidious Du|verly: go, my &s;on, the dawn is nigh, take this gold; it will keep you from want, and come back to the cot|tage. If I am gone, you will find your Clara, you will find her, &s;he is to give you her hand, it is my will.&mdash;Am I? exclaimed Clara, no, never, never!&mdash;Alexis, whither will you, my dear Alexis?&mdash;To die far from you, replies the latter! Yes, I quit forever an odious abode! O Dorance, it is thus you will en&s;nare my innocence?&mdash;If we puni&s;h crimes do we cea&s;e to be virtuous?&mdash;Sigh no more, my dear Clara: never &s;hall my hand attempt thy father's life!&mdash;Take this my promi&s;e: young man, interrupted Dorance, where are your oaths? have you already forgot that you pledged your honor?&mdash;Ah! give me enemies more entitled to be the objects of my prowe&s;s.&mdash;What? &s;hould I be a ba&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in? Who de&s;ires it! Challenge him to a &s;ingle bombat, and gain the victory.</P>
<P>Dorance added a thou&s;and other per&s;ua&s;ives, each &s;pecious than the other, in order to determine Alexis to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e; but he could not &s;ucceed. Our young hero had too high a &s;en&s;e of feeling and deli|cacy to become an in&s;trument of crime. Meanwhile Dorance and Germain lowered the draw-bridge, and Alexis left the cottage in &s;pite of the cries and tears of Clara, whom the two men detained and carried to her apartment. Alexis &s;till hears her voice, which made his heart bleed. We &s;hall leave her for a mo|ment, and &s;ee what becomes of our hero upon leaving the cottage.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t felt an emotion of joy, at &s;eeing him&s;elf thus re&s;tored to freedom; he &s;urveyed, for &s;ome time the walls of the place, which had, during a twelvemonth, been his abode! A little unea&s;y about Clara's fate, he &s;at down upon the brink of the fo&s;&s;e and gave vent to his tears. At different intervals, he heard the &s;ound of her voice; words unconnected reached his ears&mdash;<HI>Tyrants, let me die! Is he then going to murder him? Alex|is,

<P>Alexis ha&s;tened over hedges and bu&s;hes, he knew not whither to direct his road, and reflected upon what he &s;hould do, when a &s;ingular noi&s;e was heard near him under ground.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>ADVENTURES INCIDENT TO ALEXIS AFTER HIS LEAVING THE COTTAGE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>O Singular in&s;tability of things&mdash;O wonderful va|riety of human vici&s;&s;itudes!&mdash;who can explain your nature&mdash;who can flatter him&s;elf to elude your power?&mdash;Thus it was not enough of the &s;courges and evils that infe&s;t the globe; mu&s;t al&s;o the pa&s;&s;ions of men be added to them? The difference of characters, as vi&s;ible as phy&s;iognomy, are the only &s;ources of the troubles and di&s;cord which divide &s;ociety. The wicked undo the good, and drag them into the preci|pice with them&s;elves.&mdash;Thus my neighbor &s;ets fire to his hou&s;e and it con&s;umes mine: &s;o mu&s;t I, who am good natured, humane, &s;en&s;ible, generous, become the victim of the vices which infect the heart of my friends, my parents, or tho&s;e on whom I depend.&mdash;Dependence is the &s;ource of a thou&s;and di&s;orders. Such a one, born hone&s;t and virtuous, is hurried into perver&s;ene&s;s, becau&s;e he was compelled, in the cour&s;e of his life, to flatter the vanity of &s;ots, to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the pa&s;|&s;ions of the great, and to knock at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he temple of for|tune, and at every door which the hazard of circum|&s;tances had placed in his way.&mdash;A clo&s;e tie unites &s;o|ciety &s;o &s;trongly, that no individual can form a true re&s;olution without the concurrence of the others. Is it not the combination of circum&s;tances which deter|mine that profe&s;&s;ion?&mdash;It requires only a &s;ingle word, a &s;ingle &s;tep, a &s;ingle glance of beauty to overturn all your projects, and make you often take a re&s;olution quite oppo&s;ite to that which once was the favorite ob|ject of your ambition. What an in&s;tability!&mdash;What a &s;ubordination to the laws of events!</P>
<P>Alexis, whil&s;t living in the cottage, thought he &s;hould never leave it, and flattered him&s;elf to &s;pend a life of peace and tranquility. He who dete&s;ted a re&s;i|dence in towns, &s;ound nothing that could engage him
<PB N="120" REF="030364_0122_0FE5D2D69F8A7298">
to return and inhabit them a &s;econd time. Yet a &s;tranger compels him to it; a &s;tranger of a jealous, vi|olent and vindictive habit:&mdash;He bids Alexis imitate his vices&mdash;he will have him to &s;hare one half of the venom which infects his heart; he puts the dagger of crimes in his hand, and covers the atrocity to be com|mitted with the cloak of un&s;potted ju&s;tice, and heaven born gratitude. Thus to men &s;ubordinate, what &s;hould be mo&s;t &s;acred to them, to the purpo&s;e of grati|fying their pa&s;&s;ions!&mdash;Hear the covetous&mdash;he finds al|ways lawful rea&s;ons to pur&s;ue with jealou&s;y the objects of his boundle&s;s appetite&mdash;the ambitious exclaim how merit and equity ought to elevate him to the pitch of grandeur&mdash;the libertine excu&s;es him&s;elf with the vio|lence of his &s;en&s;es&mdash;the flatterer pretends the nece&s;&s;ity of making friends: they are never in the wrong!&mdash;vir|tue and ju&s;tice are always the language of their mouths, but how far are they from their hearts!</P>
<P>Thus Alexis is forced to leave all that is dear to him&mdash;a mi&s;tre&s;s, a place of refuge&mdash;in &s;hort, he aban|dons all!&mdash;forces his inclination, and runs to the world for adventures.&mdash;Now behold him alone and &s;olitary in the woods; he is dre&s;t in his former decent clothes; in one hand a knap&s;ack with provi&s;ions, the gift of Germain; in the other a knotty &s;tick; his little round hat &s;helters his face from the ardor of the &s;un; his brown hair, floating in natural ringlets, hangs about his &s;houlders. He has, indeed, the gold of Dorance, but it is a trea&s;ure which flatters him but little.&mdash;How much would he prefer &s;implicity and re&s;t!&mdash;he &s;lowly continues his way; &s;ometimes he turns towards the cottage, now out of view.&mdash;His eyes, wet with tears, are lifted towards heaven&mdash;It is of heaven he now ex|pects all&mdash;it is heaven that will be his guide, and will pre&s;erve his youth from &s;triking upon the &s;hoals of in|experience.</P>
<P>Let us accompany Alexis in all his travels&mdash;let us mark for his fate every concern which a befriended, &s;helterle&s;s orphan of eighteen mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily excite in &s;en&s;ible &s;ouls!</P>
<P>Alexis had now left the cottage one league behind him; uncertain what way to take, he &s;trayed at ran|dom,

The latter was he&s;itating whether he &s;hould &s;tay or fly, when the &s;tranger, throwing him&s;elf at his feet, cried, with a tone of voice that would have melted a cannibal's heart, "Ah! Signior! Signior! &s;ave me! help me"&mdash;"Who are you?"&mdash;"A poor harmle&s;s creature! an <HI>infelice cavaliere!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An unfortunate gentleman.</NOTE> who expects of you either life or death."&mdash;"Speak! be explicit!"&mdash;"Fir&s;t, Signior, let us leave this cur&s;ed place; we might be overheard and pur&s;ued."

<P>Alexis did not know how to believe the &s;tranger's words.&mdash;A man of a gha&s;tly a&s;pect, coming out of a cavern in the middle of a fore&s;t, alarmed his natural mi&s;tru&s;t.

<P>(Our two itinerants, at the&s;e words, got into a path which led them to the highway, and, whil&s;t they were thus proceeding, Carlo related his adventures to young Alexis, who did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle word.)</P>
<P>My father was a great mu&s;ician at Naples. He married, and had a &s;on; but a few years after, having a quarrel with a bad <HI>can&s;onier</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Singer</NOTE>, his neighbor, who pretended to be on a level with him in point of merit, they fought a duel in which my father's antagoni&s;t fell. From that moment my father was forced to quit Na|ples, to lo&s;e his place, and to take refuge with his fam|ily, at Santa Croce, a little adjacent village, where he &s;hifted, and was at the greate&s;t pains in getting a live|lihood. I was five years old, and he intended to make me an Orpheus of the fir&s;t eminence, deprived me of what is more than life to give my voice the power and &s;ound of a woman's. I lo&s;t my parents at an early period of life, and, after having long travelled through Italy, I &s;ettled at la&s;t at Fra&s;cati, where I in&s;tructed a great number of the inhabitants in mu&s;ic and compo&s;|ing. At &s;ixteen, I was independent, and left wholly to my&s;elf with a fine competency. There are many fine palaces in Fra&s;cati belonging to per&s;ons of the fir&s;t eminence; I &s;ung in their a&s;&s;emblies, and was univer|&s;ally courted; but I di&s;liked my profe&s;&s;ion; born with a feeling heart, and a gloomy mind, who&s;e only de|light was the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, I became tired of be|ing the buffoon of every body, and longed for calm and &s;olitude. Any &s;ituation in life, by which I might

have gained the&s;e advantages, had it even been beneath my own, would have appeared to me the complete&s;t happine&s;s on earth; I found it one day by the greate&s;t hazard in the world.</P>
<P>A French nobleman, who&s;e name was Mandeville, was upon his travels through Italy, and pa&s;&s;ed through Fra&s;cati. He had heard &s;o much of this <HI>Tu&s;culum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> which is built upon the declivity of a moutain, on the very &s;pot of the ancient <HI>Tu&s;culum,</HI> that he re&s;olv|ed to &s;pend &s;ome time in it. As he lived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame hou&s;e where I kept lodgings, we &s;oon became acquaint|ed. This young, rich, and hand&s;ome chevalier, was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic, and was highly delighted to hear me &s;ing. He came every night into my apart|ment, and I rehear&s;ed before him the be&s;t &s;ongs of our great ma&s;ters, accompanying them on the harp&s;icord, I then taught mu&s;ic to Signiora Lauretta Mazarelli, the elde&s;t daughter of Signior Mazarelli, de&s;cended of a noble and wealthy family. Mazarelli one day gave a concert at his hou&s;e, where I introduced the chevalier Mandeville.&mdash;How much had I to repent of my com|plai&s;ance! The chevalier had no &s;ooner &s;een Lauret|ta, than he fell de&s;perately in love with her. He made me the confidante of his pa&s;&s;ion, and by dint of intrea|ties and pre&s;ents devoted me &s;o much to his &s;ervice, that I became the &s;lave of his commands. Lauretta, who was al&s;o dying for the chevalier, having made me the &s;ame propo&s;als, I was, in &s;pite of my&s;elf, involved in the intrigue, without either daring or being able to keep out of it, for Signora Lauretta, a woman of an impetuous, &s;ie|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and revengeful temper, threatened to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> through like a &s;ieve if I dared to unravel the &s;ecret to her father. Mazarelli expected hourly a Venetian nobleman, his in|timate friend, to whom he had promi&s;ed his daughter. The Venetian arrived at this critical moment. The young Signora hated Alfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o (the name of her future &s;pou&s;e) to the utmo&s;t degree. She was the fir&s;t who propo&s;ed to the chevalier to elope with her to France. Man|deville had no &s;ort of objection. They both were in need of my &s;ervices to &s;ucceed in their enterpri&s;e, and my imprudence complied with their de&s;ire. You &s;hall &s;ee, Signior, the i&s;&s;ue of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, and the
<PB N="124" REF="030364_0127_0FE5D284216E2AA0">
circum&s;tances which re&s;ulted from it. Lauretta, &s;ince the arrival of her intended &s;pou&s;e, who was of a more jealous di&s;po&s;ition, never left the hou&s;e. She was clo&s;ely watched, and I was the only per&s;on who had acce&s;s to her apartment to give her the u&s;ual le&s;&s;on. I contrived, in order to get her out of it, a peculiar &s;tratagem, which might have turned out very bad for me, had not I made u&s;e of all the prudence and &s;kill I was ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P>Lauretta, by my advice, laid down, and feigned an indi&s;po&s;ition. I came to her father's hou&s;e, about &s;ix in the evening, and, having covered my face with a handkerchief, under pretence of a violent tooth-ach, went up to her apartment. Half an hour after, I went out and told her women, who were in an adjoin|ing room, that their mi&s;tre&s;s was fa&s;t a&s;leep, and de&s;ir|ed nobody would enter her apartment, and, condemn|ing my&s;elf for neglecting to bring an intere&s;ting piece of mu&s;ic, I returned, and in&s;tantly gave my clothes to Lauretta, and went to bed in her place. Lauretta, in this di&s;gui&s;e, put her handkerchief over her face, pa&s;&s;ed through the middle of her women, who did not know her again, left the hou&s;e, and &s;tept into a po&s;t chai&s;e, which waited, with the chevalier, in &s;ome adjacent lit|tle &s;treet. <HI>Bene, Signor, bene</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Well, &s;ir, well.</NOTE>! Signora was gone, but I was left in the lurch, and to get out of it put me at no &s;mall lo&s;s. Half an hour after her elopement, a wo|man entered the apartment, approached my bed, and a&s;ked if I wanted any thing. I had put on the night cap of Lauretta, and, for one who was ignorant of the &s;tratagem, it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the cheat. Alarmed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this &s;udden intru&s;ion, I hid my face in the pillow, and feigned, in this &s;tate to be fa&s;t a&s;leep, not <HI>&s;onno ronfatore, ma d'un &s;onno dolce et tranquillo</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Not in a &s;noring, but in a &s;weet and tranquil &s;leep.</NOTE>. The donna did not di&s;turb me in my re&s;t, but retired, and &s;hut the door after her.</P>
<P>Being anxious, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, to leave a place where my life was in danger. I put on a pair of trow&s;ers, and a brown jacket, which I had taken car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

to bring with me; then climbing up the chimney. I worked &s;o hard, both with my knees and elbows, that I reached the top in a little time. It was dark; I went down the roof, and finding the window of a neigh|boring hou&s;e open. I ventured in without knowing how I &s;hould get out of it. The door which commu|nicated to the hou&s;e was actually &s;hut, but being ea&s;y to open it from within, I did it, and went, in the dark down &s;tairs, and pa&s;&s;ed through a garden, who&s;e gate happened to be open, into the &s;treet.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t admire, Signior, the propitiou&s;ne&s;s of all the circum&s;tances. If your&s;elf had been in the &s;ame jeopardy, you would, perhaps, not have got off &s;o well; becau&s;e of de&s;tiny and prede&s;tination!&mdash;"How prede&s;|tination?" &s;aid Alexis.&mdash;<HI>Si, &s;ignor, &s;i, &s;ignor!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Yes, &s;ir; Yes, &s;ir.</NOTE> do but li&s;ten, and you will &s;oon &s;ee what I mean by this word Nay, I am a philo&s;opher&mdash;a downright philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>Alexis, judging Carlo to be an eccentric character, could not help laughing; but his companion, who was not aware of it, continued his tale with a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s really comical.</P>

&s;tratagem. Soon after, a po&s;t chai&s;e, much lighter than ours came up with us. A man, quite furious, came out&mdash;it is Alforo! "Traitor," cried he to the chevalier, "infamous ravi&s;her! &s;urrender thy prey, or thy life!"</P>
<P>The chevalier alighted, and began a bloody combat with Alforo. During the engagement, four men whom he had brought with him, &s;eized Lauretta, who had &s;wooned away dragging her with them, and put her into their chai&s;e. I flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; Mandeville's &s;ervants followed my example, and our dexterity had &s;uch an effect on our antagoni&s;ts, as to hinder them from accompli&s;hing their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Alforo received a mortal wound from the cheva|lier, who, while the former endeavored to join his ac|complices, came to defend us, and we put them to flight; but the barbarous Alforo, before his &s;trength left him, plunged his dagger into the heart of the un|fortunate Lauretta. "Die with me, perfidious wo|man!" &s;aid he, "Thou &s;halt not be my rival's"</P>
<P>The chevalier &s;aw the blow, and flew to his mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;he looked at him, and died!</P>
<P>"O gods!" exclaimed Mandeville, "O gods! could you permit this?" at the&s;e words he ran his &s;word re|peatedly through Alforo's body; but to what purpo&s;e? to mutilate a cold and gha&s;tly corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Oh! what was my &s;ituation at this dreadful &s;pec|tacle! The very idea &s;till &s;hakes my frame! I fell up|on my friend who was going to make away with him&s;elf, and having wre&s;ted the fatal weapon from his hands, I, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;ervants, put him into our chai&s;e, and drove, with the greate&s;t di&s;patch, from the bloody &s;pot. The chevalier was bereft of all his &s;en&s;es: having recovered them, he blamed us for leaving the body of his dear Lauretta; but we repre|&s;ented to him the dangers which would have attended a &s;imilar proceeding, as we might have been caught in ip&s;o facto, carrying off two dead bodies, who&s;e a&s;&s;ina|tion would be laid to our charge. Mandeville yield|ed rather to our arguments; but, during the whole journey he did nothing but weep.</P>

The road we had taken, could certainly not conduct us to France; we therefore changed it, and finally en|tered Provence, where we took the road to Paris.

It was in that delight|ful retreat we both &s;tudied philo&s;ophy, and brought it about by dint of &s;tudy and application, to convince our&s;elves of the&s;e two maxims, which ought always to live with their fellow citizens in &s;ociety.</P>

<P>You will plea&s;e to remark, that the chevalier Man|deville, <HI>mio tenero amico</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My tender friend.</NOTE> died a few years after, partly con&s;umed by his grief, and partly by his own fault.</P>

One day, walking alone in his garden, and reflecting upon his pa&s;t misfortune, he found, by chance, a pi&s;tol in his pocket. This pi&s;tol had been put in by a &s;tupid valet de chambre, who believed he had heard his ma&s;ter give him orders to do it. What does it &s;ignify? &s;aid the chevalier to him&s;elf;&mdash;I think on the misfortunes which cro&s;s our life, and now find a pi&s;tol in my pock|et&mdash;It is perhaps a decree of heaven!&mdash;Yes, without doubt, heaven will have me die by this pi&s;tol, it is evi|dent!</P>
<P>The chevalier was on the point of blowing out his brains, but the idea of not having made a ju&s;t di&s;tribu|tion of his property, made him return to his clo&s;et: he made his will, went out, hid him&s;elf in a wood of his park and lodged the fatal contents of the pi&s;tol in his mouth.</P>
<P>We heard the explo&s;ion at the ca&s;tle; but thinking the Chevalier was hunting, we minded it no farther. A

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew hours after, the gardener came in, quite frighten|ed with the report, that he had &s;een his ma&s;ter lying on the ground in the wood. We went out in ha&s;te, and found the body of the unfortunate Mandeville welter|ing in his blood.</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s what I felt in that cruel moment. I lo&s;t the u&s;e of my rea&s;on for a whole month.</P>
<P>The chevalier had left me a con&s;iderable &s;hare of property by his legacy; I received it, and went to Pa|ris to bani&s;h from my imagination the terrible phan|toms which continually tormented it.</P>
<P>In the metropolis I &s;aw company, and in a little time, &s;pent my whole fortune. You will think &s;ignior, that I &s;quandered it away in balls, fea&s;ts, and parties of plea&s;ure. No, I did not!&mdash;I obliged friends, who afterwards proved ungrateful to me; becau&s;e it was apparently to be &s;o. I lent, I gave away to every body, and &s;oon found my&s;elf without re&s;ource. I did not, however, regret the u&s;e I had made of my property, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, all men are born with wants; my e|quals expo&s;e them to me, I be&s;tow, they take; all this is very natural, but they think them&s;elves under no ob|ligation to me; I did not a&s;&s;i&s;t them with that motive.</P>
<P>Wo to the intere&s;ted man who only &s;erves people to render them grateful! but I am my&s;elf reduced to nece&s;&s;ity, and they whom I obliged will not a&s;&s;i&s;t me. Well! they are of another way of thinking; it mu&s;t apparently be &s;o. Moreover, they hinder me from do|ing as they have done. I need but beg for relief, and there is no doubt but I may find &s;ome feeling &s;ouls who will open their pur&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. Oh! &s;uch per&s;ons are very rare! and why &s;hould there be none?

<ARGUMENT>
<P>ADVENTURES INCIDENT TO ALEXIS AFTER HIS LEAV|ING THE COTTAGE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALEXIS could plainly collect from this conver&s;a|tion, that Carlo was a madman, who&s;e head was &s;tocked with &s;y&s;tems, one more erroneous than anoth|er. His way of thinking was even de&s;titute of &s;teadi|ne&s;s and &s;olidity: what he &s;aid this moment would be de&s;troyed by what he &s;aid the next; his opinions were &s;o confu&s;ed, that none of them were e&s;tabli&s;hed. He &s;eemed, however, to be endowed with an upright heart. He prayed Alexis &s;o humbly to be allowed to keep him company, he promi&s;ed &s;o firmly to follow him every where, and to join in mutually working for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, that, in &s;pite of the remembrance of Dumont's perfidy, the lover of Clara conquered his mi&s;tru&s;t, and con&s;ented to Carlo's reque&s;t. It was then he had an opportunity to &s;ee all the mad|ne&s;s of the Italian. <HI>"Santa Maria!"</HI> cried he, fal|ling down upon his knees, "<HI>Divina croce di Gie&s;u, vi ringrazio!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Divine cro&s;s of Je&s;us, I thank you!</NOTE> O good and generous cavalier!&mdash;be my friend; be my ma&s;ter!&mdash;I will forget all my misfortunes.&mdash;If you &s;hould one day marry, a &s;weet|ne&s;s of which a father's cruelty has deprived me, if you &s;hould become a father, I will bring up your chil|dren, I will carry them in my arms. <HI>O cari&s;&s;imi figlio|voli</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">O deare&s;t little &s;ons.</NOTE> I &s;ee them, they put forth their little hands, they call me their good friend&mdash;Yes, I will be their friend, I will love them as much as their <HI>tenero padre</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tender father.</NOTE>, and to live with them and you &s;hall be my greate&s;t happi|ne&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="030364_0137_0FE5D2A999A3A110">
This broken compound of languages made Alexis &s;mile, while his companion continually lifted up his hands towards heaven, and di&s;torted him&s;elf into a hundred different po&s;tures.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed a winding of the road, our two tra|vellers de&s;cried &s;everal men advancing &s;treight towards them. Alexis could not help trembling, but Siocco, who was very &s;harp-&s;ighted, begged him not to be un|ea&s;y, that it was only a detachment of the <HI>cavaliers de marechau&s;&s;ee,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A very con&s;iderable body of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;e, di&s;per&s;ed through every province of France, on purpo&s;e to clear the high-ways of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp;c.</NOTE> of whom they had no occa&s;ion to be afraid.</P>
<P>By this time the detachment was rather near, and Sciocco, who had been looking all this time, began to cry out, <HI>"O Dio!</HI> whom do I &s;ee in the middle o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> them?&mdash;an accomplice of the ruffians of the cavern&mdash;He was taken a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew days ago; he comes at the head of the&s;e guards to the cavern of his compani|ons&mdash;Let us change &s;ides, &s;ignor; I am afraid he will know me."</P>
<P>Alexis at this di&s;cour&s;e began to be &s;en&s;ible of the danger he was in. They betook them&s;elves from the highway, but the guards, to whom the ruffian had de|nounced Siocco, clap &s;purs to their hor&s;es, overtake them, and &s;eize them in the king's name.</P>
<P>Let the reader judge of our hero's grief: he de|clares his innocence; but the guards are inflexible; they load them with chains. The robber, who had betrayed them, in&s;ulted them in the mo&s;t approbrious manner. "Hah! hah! Sciocco;" &s;aid he, "the pretty buffoon of our charming company; &s;o you find at la&s;t a comrade?&mdash;He is quite a child: he began the bu&s;ine&s;s too &s;oon."</P>
<P>Alexis, overwhelmed with grief, could not utter a &s;ingle word; tears rolled down his cheeks&mdash;he moaned&mdash;his eyes were directed towards heaven, and &s;eemed to beg for &s;ome miraculous token of his inno|cence. Sciocco muttered, and &s;wore &s;olemnly, that neither his ma&s;ter nor he was guilty; he related to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> guards his adventures, but they would not hear him. He then endeavored to con&s;ole Alexis, &s;aying
<PB N="135" REF="030364_0138_0FE5D25AC2F775E0">
to him, <HI>"Mio caro mae&s;tro,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My dear ma&s;ter.</NOTE> heaven will have it, it was apparantley to be &s;o."</P>
<P>Meantime four of the hor&s;emen leave the main bo|dy of their comrades, who continue their march, and lady hold of the two unfortunate friends without mer|cy, and drag them to the town of St. Marcellin, which they reached towards &s;un&s;et.</P>
<P>They were, without any formality, committed to pri&s;on, with the con&s;olatory notice, to hold them&s;elves ready for the next day, to undergo an examination, and to be put to the rack.</P>
<P>Behold Alexis alone, &s;hut up in a narrow dungeon next to Sciocco's! Behold him, that unfortunate youth, accu&s;ed of the ba&s;e&s;t of crimes, confounded with the mo&s;t infamous wretches&mdash;What has he done? What fate awaits him?&mdash;Ah! it is much to be feared he will &s;oon be inclined to believe in prede&s;tination.</P>
<P>Alexis, &s;tretched out upon the &s;traw, melting in tears, revolved all his former adventures in his mind, accu&s;ed his father, Candor, Sciocco, nay, heaven it&s;elf! Thus he &s;pent more than half the night, when a &s;weet voice abated his de&s;pair, and re&s;tored a little clam to his &s;oul. "Alexis," cried the voice, "are you here? Is this your dungeon?"&mdash;"Alas, who&s;oever you be, &s;ave me, make my innocence known!"&mdash;"A woman who has &s;een you, and pities your youth, has it in her power to deliver you if you promi&s;e to be grateful."&mdash;"Ay, all my life, all my life!"&mdash;"Stop then, be of good cheer," The voice is &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Alexis, &s;urpri&s;ed at this event, did not know wheth|er he ought to accept of liberty thus offered him. "I may be thought guilty," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "if I fly da&s;|tardly. O my God! what am I to do? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I remain i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this infamous dungeon, if I expect ju&s;tice from my pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed judges, who are deaf to the voice of innocence, implicable cruel, what will become of me? the very idea makes me &s;tart with horror!&mdash;Ah! what need I care for what the world will &s;ay! I will go. But that woman! what is her motive to deliver me whom &s;he does not know? What intere&s;t can &s;he have?&mdash;Suppo&s;e it is a &s;nare! Ought I to tru&s;t her?"</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="030364_0139_0FE5D2E0357D8AE0">
Alexis was now more tranquil, and waited patiently for the angel of con&s;olation, who had made his &s;orrow &s;ub&s;ide, when he heard the door of his dungeon open. A young, hand&s;ome, and well-dre&s;t woman, provided with a dark lanthorn, approached him, and laying hold of his hand, &s;aid, "Come, follow me, unfortunate young man; I cannot believe you guilty; my heart &s;corns &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition&mdash;Oh! did you but know what an impre&s;&s;ion you have made upon it; but don't let us lo&s;e time." "Oh, mo&s;t generous of women! "cri|ed Alexis, "my friend is as innocent as I."&mdash;"Save him; let me be under that double obligation to you!"&mdash;"I will, with all my heart; but remember, young man, what I do for you."</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible deliverer opens the next dungeon. A|lexis called to Sciocco with a low voice, Dear Carlo, come, we are &s;et free."&mdash;<HI>Santa Maria!</HI> who can&mdash;"&mdash;"Hold your tongue, fool; you undo us."</P>
<P>Alexis was forced to &s;top the Italian's mouth with his hand, as his mad declaration might ea&s;ily have fru&s;trated their de&s;ign by a di&s;covery. They both fol|lowed their benefactre&s;s, who went up &s;everal &s;tairs, opened different doors, and conducted them to an a|partment decently furni&s;hed, where &s;he ordered them to be &s;eated. "Alexis, I will &s;ave you," &s;aid &s;he "and accompany you in your flight: hear only a few words; I am the wife of the keeper of this pri&s;on. My hu&s;|band di&s;liked and ill treated me. I &s;aw you ye&s;terday, and you made a very &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon me.&mdash;Let me fly from the man I abhor; and permit me to follow one I&mdash;I pity. But promi&s;e never to leave me."</P>
<P>Alexis was at a lo&s;s how to an&s;wer; but Sciocco, who&s;e joy was extreme, gave way to his rapture.&mdash;Should we leave you, <HI>genero&s;a dona!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Generous woman.</NOTE> we! Oh! my ma&s;ter and I &s;wear forever to &s;hew the mo&s;t perfect gratitude, the mo&s;t&mdash;"&mdash;"That is enough!" broke in the mi&s;tre&s;s of the jail; "but let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be gone."</P>
<P>Alexis had now lo&s;t all his joy. The woman who would leave a hu&s;band to follow him, appeared in his eyes, contemptible: and if he did not expre&s;s his
<PB N="137" REF="030364_0140_0FE5D2BD17FA4670">
in|dignation, it was becau&s;e the great danger into which he &s;aw him&s;elf involved, kept him in &s;ullen apathy. The woman, who con&s;idered his &s;ilence the common effect of natural &s;hyne&s;s, and was &s;atisfied with Sci|occo's an&s;wer, had ri&s;en to &s;et off, but Alexis tremb|led and repented already of his proceedings: he re|gretted his dungeon, and would fain have returned to it. He reluctantly followed his guilty deliverer, quite lo&s;t in thought, and deaf to the ejaculations of Sciocco, who whi&s;pered, "Well, heaven is ju&s;t, <HI>mio cara ami|co!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My dear friend.</NOTE>&mdash;The order of things was in confu&s;ion, but now all is &s;et to rights.&mdash;What a change! What a happi|ne&s;s!"</P>
<P>Our three fugitives de&s;cended the private &s;tairs, which led them into a little lane. A carriage waited for them, they got into it, and drove away. Having travelled two nights and one day, they reached Avig|non, where they alighted at an inn, and re&s;olved to re&s;t them&s;elves for a few hours.</P>
<P>During the journey this inamorata had a&s;ked Alexis a thou&s;and que&s;tions, which he an&s;wered with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity; but Sciocco in order to &s;ave Alexis the trou|ble of a tedious recital, related our young hero's ad|ventures, and how he had met with him in the fore&s;t of Chambarou. The woman, little &s;atisfied with his account, begged Alexis to recount his misfortunes him&s;elf; he complied, omitting certain particulars, and above all expatiated upon his re&s;idence in the cot|tage, and his pa&s;&s;ion for the fair Clara; a pa&s;&s;ion which he &s;aid death alone could extingui&s;h.</P>
<P>The keeper's wife, &s;urpri&s;ed at this avowal, per&s;uad|ed him, by the mo&s;t forcible arguments to renounce that pa&s;&s;ion, which in all appearance, could never be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; and in order to affect a change in his mind, &s;he made a plain declaration of her own.</P>
<P>Alexis could no longer re&s;train his indignation: "What, madam," &s;aid he, "you are married, and you dare think of loving me?"&mdash;"What of that, my dear? I have always been remarkable for my levity in all the circum&s;tances of my life. My hu&s;band court|ed me for a week, and tired of being a virgin I marri|ed

Thus unable to do better, I returned to St. Marcellin, and conde|&s;cended to forgive my hu&s;band, who received me a|gain. We have now lived together for &s;ix long months; and he has vexed me in a thou&s;and different ways; It was too much for me to bear, to live &s;ix months with a hu&s;band I hate!&mdash;I &s;aw you, you took my fancy, and I have &s;et you at large."</P>
<P>"No madame," an&s;wered he, "if my heart is the reward of the kindne&s;s you have done for me, I &s;hall be ungrateful; I judge &s;o by my feelings; you may claim my friend&s;hip and gratitude, but my love, never." "Traitor, remember your promi&s;e, and the &s;acrifice I made for you! You &s;hall love me, or die by my hands!"&mdash;"What a fine way of ingratiating one's &s;elf! What a woman!"&mdash;"You don't know me yet;" an|&s;wered the jailor's wife, "I am capable of every thing&mdash;I &s;hall devote you the victim of my rage, not as a traitor, by poi&s;on, or pi&s;tols, but by facing you in fair combat. Dare to re&s;i&s;t a woman!&mdash;If you will not requite me, take &s;word or pi&s;tol, becau&s;e I care not for either, and take the field with me!"&mdash;"Oh madam, are you in good earne&s;t?"&mdash;"Coward, thou tremble&s;t! Know that I have been educated to be the ornament of my &s;ex!&mdash;I can as well mount a hor&s;e as fight a duel&mdash;I can handle the &s;word as clever as any French|man. But Alexis, Alexis, give me your heart, lovely youth! give it me, and do not leave me to de&s;pair."</P>
<P>Alexis, a&s;toni&s;hed to the highe&s;t degree, was &s;truck dumb. Sciocco alone kept up the conver&s;ation with the intrepid amazon; he undertook, by phylo&s;ophical argument, to convince her, that &s;he interrupted the order, and de&s;troyed the balance of nature; that a woman ought to keep within the bounds pre&s;cribed to her &s;ex; and that only by a mo&s;t &s;upernatural prede&s;|tination &s;he &s;hould act the part of a Hect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r in petti|coats.</P>

It was during this conver&s;ation that our fugitives entered one of the Foxbourgs of Avignon, and alighted at an inn.</P>
<P>The jail keeper's wife, quite in a furious fit of amor|ous tran&s;port, propo&s;ed that Alexis &s;hould either yield to her de&s;ires, or accept a challenge to fight a duel. Sciocco offers to &s;tand ground for his ma&s;ter. "No!" an&s;wers the termagant, "No, &s;ignor, if I fight, it is always with a man."</P>
<P>This &s;cene, in fact comical, appeared in quite a dif|ferent light to Alexis. His virtuous heart rejected &s;o di&s;graceful a connexion.</P>
<P>But let us return to Clara, the unfortunate Clara, who, upon lo&s;ing her lover, is acquainted with the &s;e|cret of her birth, and obliged to live with the enemy of her father!&mdash;let us enter her very apartment, and &s;ympathi&s;e with her.</P>

<P>CLARA LEAVES THE COTTAGE.&mdash;ADVENTURE OF THE TWO ROBBERS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CLARA had &s;een her lover depart. Clara, lean|ing with her eyes and mouth again&s;t the iron|grated window of her apartment, had &s;een let down and drawn up the fatal bridge which parted her, per|haps for ever, from her dear Alexis!&mdash;She is left alone to grief, to fury, and de&s;pair. "Oh!" cried &s;he, "he flies from me to plunge the dagger in the brea&s;t of him who gave me life!&mdash;O cruel Candor! It is you who requires that horrid &s;acrifice by the hand of he &s;weete&s;t and lovlie&s;t of men!&mdash;It makes me tremble &s;till!&mdash;The raitor has brought me up with no other de&s;ign than to devote me &s;ome day to his fury, to revenge in me my father's wrongs!&mdash;O Candor, thee I loved, but Dorance I hate, I dete&s;t.

O heaven, I will prevent it, I will leave this
<PB N="140" REF="030364_0143_0FE5D2ABC4E6EDB8">
cottage which has, till now, been dear to me. But how can I e&s;cape?"</P>
<P>Clara, determined to leave Candor, and to go every where in pur&s;uit of her lover, invented a thou&s;and ex|pedients to effect her elopement, which rea&s;on de&s;troy|ed by degrees. There was but one that &s;eemed prac|ticable.</P>
<P>After having well deliberated on it, &s;he began, with great trouble, to take off the &s;taple of the lock of her apartment. She then waited till night, which was the mo&s;t favorable time to carry her project into execution. All day long, Candor and Germain endeavored to con&s;ole her, and to prove that &s;he would &s;oon &s;ee her Alexis again. At night Germain came, as u&s;ual, to lock the door; but in vain did he give him&s;elf that trouble; he turned the bolt of the lock, which having nothing to receive it, could an&s;wer no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Clara went down &s;tairs, and &s;taid till the two old men had de&s;cended into the &s;ubterraneous temple. She recollected that Alexis had been led almo&s;t to the cen|ter of it through a cavern, who&s;e entrance was from the fore&s;t. She had al&s;o remarked, on the preceding night, the door which led to this &s;ubterraneous temple. She intended to hide her&s;elf in the cellar till the two old men &s;hould have left it, and to e&s;cape through that &s;ame door.</P>
<P>She de&s;cended quietly into the temple, the door of which had been left open, and hid her&s;elf behind a pillar, and was witne&s;s to all the extravagancies of Candor and his old &s;ervant. After having offered their complaints to the a&s;hes of Adela and her &s;on, they both retired. No &s;ooner Clara &s;aw them depart, than &s;he opened the door of the &s;ubterraneous cavern, which &s;he could ea&s;ily effect from within, but, groping in the dark, &s;oon found her&s;elf obliged to &s;top, &s;eized with horror and fright.</P>
<P>She recollected there was in the temple a lamp al|ways burning before the tomb; &s;he returned with a de&s;ign a fetch it away; but, all on a &s;udden, the &s;ilence of the place, the horror &s;he felt before the dead, brought a thou&s;and tremendous phantoms to her ima|gination. She &s;topped, and kneeled down upon the
<PB N="141" REF="030364_0144_0FE5D2C424B68B58">
&s;teps of the monument; &s;he thought &s;he heard a voice break through the marble which covered the coffin. "Oh! my mother!" cried &s;he, "is it you I hear?&mdash;Are the&s;e the woeful moans of my unhappy mother? Speak, what will you have me do? Do your &s;acred manes ri&s;e again&s;t the project of an imprudent daugh|ter? What do you foretell me? What mu&s;t I do?"</P>
<P>Clara could &s;carce re&s;pire; her chilled heart beat no longer. A &s;word &s;tained with gore, a parcel of pa|pers offer them&s;elves to her &s;ight. "It is the &s;word that flew Adela!" &s;he cried, "and the&s;e papers &s;ay, "<HI>Adieu my dear Duverly, come &s;oon to join your Adela."</HI></P>
<P>Clara put the bloody &s;word and the parcel of let|ters into the &s;epulchral urn from whence &s;he had taken them. But di&s;covering an empty tomb in the corner, it attracted her &s;ad curio&s;ity upon it &s;he &s;ees the words: <HI>Unfortunate family! thou &s;halt be revenged.&mdash;This tomb is de&s;|tined for the daughter of my enemy.</HI></P>
<P>Though per&s;uaded that this tomb was erected when the cottage was fir&s;t built, her terrors and apprehen&s;ions were revived again. She took her mother's letters, &s;eiz|ed the lamp, and entered the cavern, through which &s;he pur&s;ued her way.</P>
<P>Thus alone, bewildered 'mid&s;t the &s;hades of night, &s;he goes, like Hypermne&s;tra, in &s;earch of her lover. She now leaves the cavern, and enters the fore&s;t which &s;urrounds it.</P>
<P>Profound darkne&s;s &s;till maintained the empire of night; the fore&s;t was all in awful &s;ilence. The trem|bling Clara &s;trayed in this wilderne&s;s, with her thoughts on the dangers that threatened her in a place full of rob|bers and precipices. She reflected that the light of her lamp might attract &s;ome of tho&s;e ruffians, and expo&s;e her to their cruelty; &s;he extingui&s;hed it, and &s;et it on the ground. She was determined to return to the cavern to pa&s;s the night, when &s;he perceived, at a great di&s;tance, a light which the lamp had hindered her from &s;eeing before. She turned pale and &s;topped. The light advanced &s;traight towards her, Luckily her pre&s;ence of mind did not for&s;ake her; u&s;ed to mo&s;t bodily exerci&s;es, perceiving a tree, &s;he climed up and &s;at down upon a bough.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="030364_0145_0FE5D25B8B8E8AB8">
Two men drew near, one holding a lantern, the other a parcel. "Well, <HI>Handofdeath,</HI>" &s;aid one, "we have walked pretty well; we are now near the cavern." "I think it is time, Mr. <HI>Breakpate,</HI> to end our journey; it begins to tire my old legs. The&s;e two thou&s;and louis d'ors are d&mdash;d heavy! Sit down under this tree." "Mr. Handofdeath, now tell me a little of the &s;tory about that man; how the devil, my boy, could you alone rob him of &s;uch a load of money?" "Hark'ye and I'll tell ye. I came back la&s;t night from the di&s;|covery on which my comrades had &s;ent me, and there was a man riding full gallop upon the highway, with a portmanteau behind him. I felt &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow of &s;pirits and courage, that I hid my&s;elf behind a tree, deter|mined to have a go at him. The moment he pa&s;&s;ed me. I fired my pi&s;tol, his hor&s;e fell, the rider very na|turally followed, and I fell upon him. Come, my friend, &s;aid I, give me what you have got in that bag, and don't be long. "Pray, Mr. Highwayman," &s;aid he, "I hope you won't rob another thief!" What do you mean by another? &s;aid I. "Why I was a banker," &s;aid he, "and am now a bankrupt for a very large &s;um. I have about eight hundred thou&s;and livres in bank notes, and about two thou&s;and louis d'ors in ca&s;h. I can a&s;&s;ure you, upon my honor, I &s;tole it all! One wolf &s;hould not devour another. Pray have pity on your comrade." I could not help laughing at the fellow's &s;peech. "Mr. Banker, &s;aid I, you ought to be very thankful for being a thief like me; if you was an hone&s;t man, I would murder you&mdash;but, as I find you are a partner in trade, I have &s;ome regard for you, by the bye though, you mu&s;t give me a bit of your luck&mdash;I want the ca&s;h, and you may keep the papers."&mdash;"O heaven!" &s;aid he, "what the whole &s;um?"

I put up with that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and gave him the watch word for the other robbers, and away I came. He thanked me very civilly, and made his way on foot. I wou'dn't, d'ye &s;ee, take ad|vantage of the man; i&s;n't that con&s;cience? Now, Mr.

Breakpate, I met you coming along, you a&s;ked me what I had got? I owned it all; but we mu&s;t keep the &s;ecret between us. Zounds! have we any bu&s;ine&s;s to divide the money among our comrades? Have they help'd to the glory of the day? No! So let's hide the ca&s;h &s;ome where, go back to the cavern, and when we want it, we know where it is." "That's your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort, my brave boy!" "Well, where &s;hall we hide it." "The be&s;t way I &s;hould think, would be beneath &s;ome tree, and mark it properly. "Stop, do you know this &s;pot well?" "Yes, that I do; there are four high-ways all around, and a path that leads to the old mad|man's cottage." "O yes, you are right; I have heard &s;ay the old dunny has got a very pretty daughter!" "Who knows that? as yet we never &s;aw any body come out of the place;&mdash;Don't you think there would be &s;ome way to get into their quarters to make booty?" "The devil a booty you'd make; the old fellow lives as a hermit; ar'n't there walls, ditches, and every thing to keep us out?" "So it is quite a &s;trong hold?" "Aye, and a good one, "I'll warrant you,&mdash;come don't let's forget our yellow boys;&mdash;This is a fine tree; won't it do to protect the ca&s;h?" "To be &s;ure!" "Come then, bear a hand &s;teady to work."</P>
<P>Handofdeath and Breakpate tore a branch from the tree on which poor Clara &s;at. They made a kind of &s;take of the branch, and dug a hole large and deep enough to contain the bag. They accordingly de|po&s;ited the money, and covered it with earth; after which they marked the tree with four or five notches, and withdrew, not without having well examined the place and its environs.</P>
<P>What Clara felt during the conver&s;ation and pro|ceeding of the&s;e two villains, may ea&s;ily be judged. What they &s;aid about the cottage, had above all, frightened her to an extreme. She was afraid le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t they &s;hould di&s;cover her, and in &s;pite of her dre&s;s ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h her &s;ex by her features and tone of voice.

She dug out the trea&s;ure with the &s;ame &s;take they had interred it with; but finding the precious burden too heavy, nece&s;&s;ity taught her an expedient.

Thus provid|ed &s;he commenced her march. She took her way from certain hints, dropped by the robbers, and her imagi|nation was pregnant with plea&s;ing thoughts, and the hope of again meeting with Alexis.</P>

<P>ADVENTURES INCIDENT TO CLARA AFTER HER LEAV|ING THE COTTAGE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE curtain of night was drawn, and Aurora, in bright array, pur&s;uing darkne&s;s from the gates of the ea&s;t, u&s;hered in the bright god: all was awakening all reviving in nature. From all parts the birds tuned their melodies to celebrate the return of day.</P>
<P>Clara continued cheerfully her road to St. Marcel|lin, in order to proceed from that city to Valence, where &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to enquire for Alexis. She arrived at St. Marcellin the morning, and &s;topped at the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Here &s;he found the whole town in an uproar concerning the elopement of the jailor's wife with two pri&s;oners. This news was communicated to Clara, who thought it &s;carcely worth her hearing. All her eagerne&s;s, all her wi&s;hes, tend to inform her&s;elf of Alexis. Alexis! an&s;wered the people. Alexis! yes, you are right, he is one of the thieves.&mdash;Is not he a young man, of &s;uch an age, of &s;uch an appearance? He&mdash;He mu&s;t certainly be the man?&mdash;the jailor's wife fell in love with him, and they went off together.</P>
<P>This was more terrible than a thunder &s;troke to poor Clara. She dropped down; her landlady, who relat|ed the &s;tory, came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Pray, my dear creature, do you know that Alexis?&mdash;If you do, I

<P>The landlady could not comprehend her meaning, Clara, forbearing all farther elucidation on the &s;ubject, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, that very in&s;tant, the town of St. Marcellin, where every thing &s;he had heard &s;truck her with a&s;toni&s;h|ment.

I will renounce, I will forget him, and &s;eek &s;ome corner of the world, where, far from the cot|tage, I may langui&s;h out a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Clara, though well per&s;uaded of her lover's infidel|ity, per&s;i&s;ts in her de&s;ign of directing her journey to the capital, where &s;he thought to find her fickle &s;wain with his new conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Having &s;lept that night at Aubervive, &s;he proceeded the day following, to Vienna. In the cour&s;e of her march, &s;he entered a little remote hermitage upon her right. It con&s;i&s;ted of a chapel, committed to the care of three capuchins, who were &s;o very poor as to be obliged &s;ometimes to ring the bells as a &s;ignal of their di&s;tre&s;s, and to receive alms from the adjacent villages.</P>
<P>Clara fell on her knees before the altar, where a prie&s;t was officiating, and addre&s;&s;ed her mo&s;t fervent prayers to the maker of all. Soon her pious ejaculations were di&s;turbed by the remembrance of her misfortunes;&mdash;&s;he &s;ighed, while tears flowed plenteou&s;ly from her lovely eyes.</P>
<P>A lady of a middling age, and very well dre&s;&s;ed, approached her&mdash;O, Good God, my child! what is the matter?&mdash;you weep!&mdash;Have you met with &s;ome mis|fortune?&mdash;you have perhaps committed a &s;in that cau&s;|es remor&s;e&mdash;Yes, madam, I have committed one&mdash;a

Come, my dear heart, be faithful and &s;incere, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Father Ste|phen, you will come to dine with me to morrow, wo'n't you?&mdash;Bring with you that child.&mdash;You cannot continue your road to day, my angel; devout this whole day to piety&mdash;Let me not hinder you.&mdash;What a pretty lad!&mdash;what a pity that &s;o lovely a &s;heep &s;hould have &s;trayed from the flock of the faithful.

<P>The beloved of Alexis made a general confe&s;&s;ion of the particulars of her education, her flight, and the perfidy of her friend. The father conducted her from church to the lady's hou&s;e, and gave her on the road the mo&s;t &s;alutary advice. My child, you mu&s;t re|nounce that giddy youth, you mu&s;t give him up; &s;o lovely a creature de&s;erves better &s;entiments.

Clara promi&s;ed not to di&s;clo&s;e her &s;ex to the baron|e&s;s, and thus di&s;cour&s;ing, they both arrived at her ca&s;tle.

<P>My dear, &s;aid &s;he, you may &s;tay with me for life, if you like, it only re&s;ts with you; I &s;hall take care to make every thing plea&s;ing and comfortable; but if your fancy is for the beau monde, you will not find it with me, for I &s;ee no other company than father Stephen, he is my intimate friend; we have been acquainted with one another &s;o long&mdash;You will be highly benefited by his conver&s;ation.&mdash;Yes, madam, replied the friar, I will do whatever lies in my power to divert him, but you will not keep him &s;hut up all day long? you will &s;end him &s;ometimes to me, I hope; there is a fine fi&s;h pond in our hermitage; if he loves angling, he is wel|come to amu&s;e him&s;elf; and be&s;ides, my numerous collection of books are at his &s;ervice too; we &s;hall read together in my little cell&mdash;what do you &s;ay to that, A|lexis?

At night, father Stephen, who was obliged to re|turn to the hermitage, retired with a kind of &s;orrow, yet not before he made Clara promi&s;e to come next morning to &s;ee him in his little cell.</P>

At the&s;e words, the barone&s;s &s;eemed to be out of her &s;en&s;es&mdash;She &s;ighed &s;eemed enraptured, embraced her, and painted the happine&s;s which two &s;ympathetic hearts &s;hould enjoy in a retreat &s;o delightful as hers. The pa&s;&s;ion of the old fool ro&s;e to &s;uch a degree, that Clara, &s;imple and innocent as &s;he was, perceived it, and was much alarmed. She was twenty times up|on the point of making her&s;elf known; but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to father Stephen's command, had determined to con|&s;ult him upon what conduct he would advi&s;e her to a|dopt in &s;o delicate a juncture.</P>
<P>She returned next morning to the hermitage, and recounted every thing that had happened. The fa|ther, who had never thought his old friend capable of &s;uch folly, and who was de&s;irous of accompli&s;hing his own de&s;ign upon Clara, ordered her again to conceal her &s;ex, and to make the mo&s;t vigorous re&s;i&s;tance a|gain&s;t the old woman's propo&s;als. He then touched upon his own feelings, and endeavored to be more ex|plicit in his language. Clara, &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed at

the capuchin, than at the old barone&s;s, returned, quite in confu&s;ion, to her temporary abode.</P>
<P>The barone&s;s pu&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s much farther that day. The friar came to dinner, took a&s;ide Clara, and made a plain declaration of his love. Clara, being thus tea&s;ed by the&s;e two hypocrites, took the wi&s;e re&s;o|lution of quitting that dangerous a&s;ylum, and its bane|ful tyranny.</P>
<P>She was &s;o imprudent as to mention her de&s;ign to father Stephen. The capuchin was &s;truck dumb for &s;ome time, but recollecting him&s;elf afterwards, he feigned to approve of Clara's project. Yes, my daugh|ter, &s;aid he, you do well; your age, your charms, in a word, every thing in you, had for a time alienated my rea&s;on, and made me regardle&s;s of my duty; but now, re&s;tore me to my&s;elf, and to my &s;acred function! fly, and let me forget you, if po&s;&s;ible! Beware of let|ting the barone&s;s know what you are about to do; who knows but that violent pa&s;&s;ionate woman might detain you again&s;t your con&s;ent. When &s;he &s;hall be taking her nap after dinner, take your things, and &s;et out. Mind you do not leave the high road; you are only two &s;mall leagues from Lyons; you will be there to night; there you can take po&s;t, and go wherever you plea&s;e. Adieu! my dear Clara! You &s;ee that I re&s;ign all; the barone&s;s would not be &s;o rea&s;onable. Adieu. Alas! how &s;orry I am.</P>
<P>Clara was overjoyed to find the father willing not to interrupt her project; &s;he returned to the ca&s;tle, and dined quietly with the barone&s;s. After dinner, the latter, according to cu&s;tom, laid down on her couch to take a nap; Clara no &s;ooner &s;aw her a&s;leep, than &s;he walked off with her things, and pur&s;ued her read to Lyons. Pa&s;&s;ing through a delightful meadow, &s;he re|&s;olved to re&s;t her&s;elf at the end of it, and reflect upon what &s;he &s;hould do. The barone&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, when &s;he di&s;covers that I am gone, will tax me with ingratitude, and not give her&s;elf any trouble to run in pur&s;uit of me.</P>
<P>The &s;un began to vi&s;it the we&s;tern hemi&s;phere, a gen|tle coolne&s;s pervaded the air, the earth opened her bo|&s;om to receive the evening dew, and the all fragrant
<PB N="150" REF="030364_0153_0FE5D25DA2F2CAE8">
flowers exhaled a thou&s;and perfumes, when Clara, &s;eated on a ri&s;ing turf, &s;upported her head with one hand, reflecting what to do. She &s;at there &s;ome time, and heard not the rattling of a carriage which &s;topped before her; this put an end to her reverie. A man dre&s;&s;ed in black came out; it is father Stephen. Cla|ra, &s;aid he, behold the power of love! I could not re|&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of following you wherever you went; I have thrown off my &s;acred habit; it is no longer fa|ther Stephen, but a man enraptured with your charms, and who only wi&s;hes to live at your feet; let us not tarry: &s;tep into this carriage with me; come, a|nother minute will undo us. Oh, heaven, &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fly with you, with a man who de&s;erts the mo&s;t &s;acred duty and profe&s;&s;ion, to&mdash;Clara, we &s;hall talk of this in the carriage; come, or I'll die before you.</P>
<P>He immediately pulled a pi&s;tol from his pocket, and applied it to his forehead. Clara &s;eized his arm. She was moved, and knew no longer how to behave.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were in this wavering &s;ituation, they de&s;cried a carriage amid&s;t clouds of du&s;t; it drew near and the barone&s;s alighted; &s;he approached, and up|braided them with the keene&s;t reproaches. Cruel, treacherous, faithle&s;s man, cried &s;he, what harm have I done thee, that thou &s;hould'&s;t carry off my Alexis? he for&s;akes me, and thou art the cau&s;e: My Alexis, return with me, return, and bring me not to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The friar looked very fooli&s;h; Clara blu&s;hed; and the barone&s;s laying hold of one of her arms, attempt|ed to make her get into her carriage. Stephen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">laying hold of the other, exclaimed, no, madam, he &s;hall not go with you; you would be the ruin of that innocent young man; you would hinder him from completing the work of &s;alvation: he told me all; I will &s;ave him. Oh, that will not do, replied the barone&s;s, pulling Clara to her &s;ide, he &s;hall come with me; an&s;wered the monk, pulling her towards him, we &s;hall &s;ee who is to be conqueror.</P>
<P>Long would this di&s;pute have la&s;ted, had not an un|for&s;een event mo&s;t propitious to Clara, &s;aved her from the rapacity of the&s;e two vultures, and di&s;comfi|ted their criminal intentions. Thus heaven, which &s;he
<PB N="151" REF="030364_0154_0FE59AEDC980B958">
invoked, came to relieve her; and &s;ent, in her trouble, a deliverer, a comforter, a man who will be forthwith mo&s;t dear to her. Let us make a moment's digre&s;&s;ion from this &s;cene of &s;trife, and return to the identical A|lexis, whom we have left at an inn, with his friend Carlo, and the wife of the jail keeper of St. Marcellin, who propo&s;ed either a criminal intrigue, or a duel.</P>
<P>The reader may &s;ee that the hero and heroine of our hi&s;tory are equally unfortunate, and that both mu&s;t &s;truggle with vicious individuals who make at|tempts upon their virtue and innocence.</P>

The latter found means, during breakfa&s;t, to admini&s;ter the rem|edy to our Dulcinea with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that &s;he &s;oon after complained of a violent head ach, and fell into a profound &s;leep. Alexis and his companion, without lo&s;s of time, repaired immediately to the royal po&s;t|office.&mdash;They are a&s;ked to what place they wi&s;h to go&mdash;Where you plea&s;e, an&s;wered they&mdash;To Mar&s;eilles?&mdash;Yes, to Mar&s;eilles.</P>
<P>A chai&s;e is got ready for them, and they depart&punc; we will not di&s;turb the &s;leeping inamorata, but fol|low our two travellers.</P>
<P>Next morning, they arrived at Mar&s;eilles, and hir|ed lodgings at an hotel &s;ituated at the entrance of the new town. They were, however, highly embarra&s;&s;|ed for want of ca&s;h. The trea&s;ure of Dorance, which was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Alexis, had been taken from him by the officers of ju&s;tice, when he was committed to jail at St. Marcellin. He was left de&s;titute, and his comrade labored under the &s;ame predicament.</P>
<P>Sciocco advi&s;ed his friend to make the be&s;t of his abilities in mu&s;ic&mdash;Alexis accepted his propo&s;al. In con&s;equence, they adverti&s;e them&s;elves as mu&s;icians de&s;irous to perform in a public concert.&mdash;There re|que&s;t is granted, a day appointed, two amateurs an|nounced, and the hou&s;e very full&mdash;Alexis performed a concerto on the harp&s;ichord, Carlo &s;ung a rondeau in Italian, both were applauded, courted, and well paid.</P>
<P>This <HI>debut</HI> made them bold, and they intended to en|gage for a &s;econd appearance in public, but a favora|ble event furni&s;hed them with another kind of re|&s;ource.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were one morning performing &s;ome mu&s;ical <HI>morceaux,</HI> a per&s;on about forty years of age, and of a wealthy appearance, entered their appart|ment.&mdash;Let me not di&s;turb you gentlemen; go on, go on, &s;aid he&mdash;I &s;hould be very &s;orry to interrupt you.&mdash;Sir, we are too de&s;irous to know what procures us the honor of &s;eeing you.&mdash;Well, gentleman, we will &s;it

<P><PB N="154" REF="030364_0157_0FE59AF3BAC1F248">
The receiver general then withdrew. Alexis up|braided Carlo with a thou&s;and reproaches for having acquie&s;ced in propo&s;als of &s;o &s;ingular a nature. What, &s;aid he, can you, Sciocco decide &s;o freely and without my concurrence? Come, an&s;wer me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you know that man or his mi&s;tre&s;s?&mdash;It is, indeed, a pretty function he lays on us; but&mdash;it is a matter of marriage, replied Carlo&mdash;</P>
<P>Sciocco was running on, but Alexis took no notice of his fooli&s;h arguments; he was thinking in what light he &s;hould con&s;ider an adventure, which gave ri&s;e to his &s;u&s;picions, and foreboded nothing good.</P>
<P>While Alexis made the&s;e reflections, and Sciocco continued his arguments, the receiver general entered the apartment. Come, gentlemen, &s;aid he, let us go&mdash;let us &s;ee the in&s;en&s;ible Sophia, and may I be indebted to you for the conque&s;t of her heart, my gratitude &s;hall be boundle&s;s&mdash;But mind, I leave you the little coffer, which you will deliver to her, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ts in her cruelty&mdash;But let us not mention it before the time is come&mdash;I de&s;ire either her hatred or her hand. But &s;ir, &s;aid Alexis, why don't you keep the coffer at your own hou&s;e?&mdash;you can give it us in due time as well as now. I in&s;i&s;t on your having it here, replied the re|ceiver&mdash;I intend going upon a journey which will la&s;t five weeks; of cour&s;e, I &s;hall not be able to give it you&mdash;My friends, I think it is as &s;afe in your hands as in my own.</P>
<P>Alexis would not venture any farther que&s;tions. They all three left the hou&s;e, entered a &s;pacious &s;treet, where the dwelling was &s;ituated. A governe&s;s made her appearance, and conducted them to the parlour, where the fair Sophia was amu&s;ing her&s;elf with per|forming on the harp&s;ichord. Sophia, &s;aid the receiver, you know that I mu&s;t go to Paris; my bu&s;ine&s;s will detain me there for &s;ome time&mdash;As I don't wi&s;h you to be without occupation, I beg you would be docile to the le&s;&s;ons which the&s;e gentlemen will give you; I &s;incerely hope to perceive, after my return, that they have operated &s;ome change in you.</P>
<P>Sophia made no reply; it is thus you mind what I &s;ay? cried the receiver&mdash;Come, hold up your head,
<PB N="155" REF="030364_0158_0FE5D31C93995198">
and thank the&s;e gentlemen&mdash;What, are you going to cry? I am tired of your little airs, mi&s;s; and I a&s;&s;ure you, they &s;hall not deceive me any longer&mdash;come, give us a &s;ong, and let us &s;ee what you can do?</P>
<P>Sophia, after much begging, and intreating, &s;ung the following air, and accompanied it on the harp&s;i|chord:
<Q><L>Of a &s;wain &s;adly mourning his doom,</L>
<L>My eyes the la&s;t angui&s;h did &s;ee!</L>

<L>Think on Hylas, and bani&s;h alarms;</L>
<L>In death there is nothing I dread,</L>
<L>Since I've liv'd to expire in thy arms!</L></Q></P>
<P>When Sophia had done, the receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd her again. What means this &s;ong, mi&s;s?&mdash;you &s;ing none but langui&s;hing ditties&mdash;I do not like it&mdash;I love gay, merry, and plea&s;ant airs&mdash;Come, come, the&s;e gentle|men will change all that&mdash;will you be attentive to them, Sophia? will you follow their advice? I love you, you know it well&mdash;I hope therefore you will make me &s;ome trifling amends for the pains I have be&s;tow|ed on your education&mdash;Who would have taken care of you Sophia, had not I pitied your fate?&mdash;you that was born poor, and bereft of your parents when a helple&s;s infant in the cradle? you had no friend but me; Ah, Sophia, why not add to this title another more &s;acred and dearer &s;till; a title which would ac|compli&s;h my every wi&s;h? Sophia remained dumb &s;till; but that &s;ilence, and a motion of her head proved plainly how far &s;he was from granting him that title.</P>
<P>Alexis and Sciocco were quite lo&s;t in amazement; the receiver almo&s;t put him&s;elf in a pa&s;&s;ion and all three retired. You &s;ee, &s;aid the latter, how &s;he hates me. It is becau&s;e you treat her a little too rudely, replied Sci|occo. Nay, rudely! that little fly creature has took a lik|ing to a giddy young &s;park, by whom I have been nearly knocked down an hundred times. Have you a rival! In|deed I have! he formerly had the impudence to vi&s;it her, but &s;ince I threatened Sophia to &s;end her to a convent if he &s;hould renew his addre&s;&s;es, he has kept out of the way; I doubt not, however, of their meeting
<PB N="156" REF="030364_0159_0FE5D28E478F8430">
privately, and keeping up a corre&s;pondence, in &s;pite of the vigilance of the governe&s;s, who is much devoted to my intere&s;t. Since &s;he has a lover, an&s;wered Sciocco, were I in your place, and did find him with her, I would give him a &s;ound drubbing. This is ju&s;t what I mean to do; but let us change the conver&s;ation: you promi&s;e, gentlemen, to u&s;e your be&s;t efforts in my behalf, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">often her heart if po&s;&s;ible. We certainly &s;hall, an&s;wered Alexis; but it &s;eems to me an ardu|ous ta&s;k. What of that, if it be impo&s;&s;ible to bring her about, I am determined to abandon her; the mo|ney which is in the little coffer will help her to take &s;ome re&s;olution, and I will do my be&s;t to forget her.</P>
<P>Sciocco &s;pent the day in convincing his friend that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the whole of the matter as highly advantageous to him&s;elf; but Alexis would not be|lieve him. Next morning the receiver came to fetch and in&s;tal them in his office. In the afternoon they gave a le&s;&s;on to Sophia, which &s;he took with great carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and &s;eeming tokens of di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>A few days after Alexis perceived that the young lady had ca&s;t &s;ome &s;entimental glances upon him; he thought it a favorable opportunity to gain her confi|dence, and to turn the conver&s;ation upon the receiver. Sophia, who had thus di&s;tingui&s;hed our hero from his companion, &s;queezed his hand, whi&s;pering in his ear, Did you but know him, &s;ir, as I do! he is a very dan|gerous man! The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions alarmed poor A|lexis; he perceived that the di&s;creet Sophia dared not to come to an explanation before Sciocco, and changed the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The day following, while Sciocco was amu&s;ing him|&s;elf with &s;inging, and preludi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g on Sophia's harp&s;i|chord, Alexis took her in private: Mi&s;s, &s;aid he, what you told me the other day, gives me &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ea|&s;ine&s;s: is it po&s;&s;ible the receiver is a deceitful and wicked man? Wicked, &s;ir, ay, that he knows better than I! How would I ble&s;s the &s;uccouring hand that would free me from his tyranny! I have more confi|dence in you than in your friend; Come to night a|lone; the governe&s;s, who is much attached to me, will let you in. Come, I pray; I will tell you all;
<PB N="157" REF="030364_0160_0FE5D31E09A11A68">
you &s;hall know what the man who &s;ends you hither<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> capable of; and when you are per&s;uaded of his treach|ery and blackne&s;s, you will repent having known him.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e alarmed Alexis to the highe&s;t degree; he was all compliance. At night, wi&s;hing to get rid of Sciocco, he feigned indi&s;po&s;ition, and a want of re&s;t. Carlo wi&s;hed him a good night, and retired to his own apartment. But Alexis, in&s;tead of going to bed, put on a cloak, ran ha&s;tily down the private &s;tairs, and repaired immediately to Sophia, of whom he expected &s;uch elucidations as would enable him to take proper mea&s;ures of conduct with the receiver.</P>
<P>The governe&s;s was waiting for him at the door. Sophia and he lock them&s;elves up in a room, where the perfidious pupil made a thou&s;and fal&s;e reports to her young ma&s;ter, to injure the character of her pro|tector. To explain this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to add, that Sophia, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was the mo&s;t fal&s;e and un|grateful, dete&s;ted the man who had always treated her with fatherly regard and affection, and to who&s;e gen|ero&s;ity &s;he owed numberle&s;s obligations: carried her perver&s;ene&s;s to a &s;till higher degree of cen&s;ure, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by a &s;et of mercinary dome&s;tics, gave daily proofs of the mo&s;t &s;candalous and revolting conduct. She had been in love with a young &s;park, but Alexis had now made a more lively impre&s;&s;ion upon her heart. She hoped, by tracing a touching picture of her own &s;ituation, and of the pretended vice of her protector, to &s;often our hero, and engage him &s;o far as to elope with her.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Clara's lover, locked up with Sophia, li&s;ten|ed, with the mo&s;t blind and implicit credulity, to the lies of the latter, the receiver, who had pa&s;&s;ed by chance through the &s;treet in which his mi&s;tre&s;s lived, had &s;een a young man enter muffled in a long cloak. He doubted not but her ancient gallant returned: rage and jealou&s;y overpowered his &s;en&s;es. Hah! hah! &s;aid he, is it thus I am duped? and that deceitful governe&s;s, whom I con&s;idered as my &s;toute&s;t adher|ent! Well, I &s;wear to take vengeance upon the young &s;park, who has offended me &s;o often; and, as to So|phia, &s;he &s;hall hear of me to-morrow.</P>

The receiver, per&s;uaded that his rival would &s;tay all night at Sophia's, went quickly to Sciocco. Where is your friend? He is a&s;leep; he is not well. I &s;hould be glad to &s;peak to him this moment. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, he has retired to his bed-chamber; he is a&s;leep. Well, my dear Sciocco, I can't help it, you mu&s;t come a|long with me, and help me to give a &s;ound drubbing to my in&s;olent rival, who has ju&s;t got acce&s;s to Sophia, that treacherous Sophia! To be &s;ure, Signior, I am &s;orry my ma&s;ter cannot be of the party; it would not be worth while to awake him for that; we &s;hall do the bu&s;ine&s;s full as well without him; I will &s;erve you with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous fidelity.</P>
<P>The receiver and Sciocco, taking each a good cud|gel, lay in ambu&s;cade oppo&s;ite Sophia's door, deter|mined to wait all night, if required, till the pretended rival &s;hould leave the hou&s;e, and fall into their hands.</P>
<P>Sophia, who had all this while frightened Alexis re&s;pecting her protector, conjured him to &s;ave her, to take her with him, and to deliver her from a man whom &s;he hated more than death. It was in vain for Alexis to oppo&s;e her arguments, Sophia would hear no rea&s;on. Alas! my friend, &s;aid &s;he, that man is capable of ruining me and even you, if he finds it his intere&s;t; it is a great misfortune for you to have known him, and I am &s;till more to be pitied, if I am con&s;train|ed to live with him: Oh! help me, my generous youth! I don't care where I fly &s;o I get rid of my ty|rant! Alexis was &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed, that he knew not kow to act. He promi&s;ed to think maturely of it, and to give her a deci&s;ive an&s;wer next day, at the u|&s;ual hour of her le&s;&s;on. Sophia, before he went away, &s;howed her&s;elf &s;o kind to him, as to obtain a complete victory over his will. Alexis, however took his leave, quite moved at what he had been told.</P>
<P>Well per&s;uaded that the receiver mu&s;t be a man of the blacke&s;t character, he took the re&s;olution to re|turn the my&s;terious coffer, which he had received the morning before. Who knows, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, whe|ther this coffer does not contain papers, jewels and o|ther articles, which might very likely undo me, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

Amid&s;t the&s;e reflections, he went down &s;tairs, left the hou&s;e, and &s;hut the &s;treet door after him. He had &s;carcely walked three or four yards, when the two companions &s;ally forth from their ambu&s;cade, fall up|on him, and give him the mo&s;t con&s;ummate drubbing before ever he had time to look about him. Alexis turned round and perceived the receiver and Sciocco&punc; what becomes of him at that &s;ight! he dares not o|pen his mouth, and receives, quite mute, all the blows which Sciocco deals on him in a mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner.

<HEAD>CHAP, VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>ALEXIS LEAVES MARSEILLES.&mdash;ADVENTURES AT THE INN.&mdash;A NEW SITUATION.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALEXIS, who &s;uffered great pain, reflected upon this &s;ad accident. What have I done to that mi&s;erable Italian? what could induce him to make &s;uch an attempt upon my life? Oh heaven! on whom can I rely? That cur&s;ed receiver has &s;urely &s;een me enter Sophia's hou&s;e! he mu&s;t have been kindled with fury; he mu&s;t have fetched Sciocco, who, not find|ing me in my apartment, has ea&s;ily given credit to &s;ome &s;tory &s;et up by his infamous accomplice: But can he, he that &s;eemed to love me, have recour&s;e to &s;uch extremities!</P>
<P>The&s;e were the meditations of poor Alexis; and wounded as he was, he would rather &s;uffer death, than reque&s;t Sciocco to fetch him a &s;urgeon. Thus he &s;pent the night in groans and complaints. In the morning, Carlo, who thought him fa&s;t a&s;leep, entered his apartment on his toes. Alexis, trembling at his approach, hid his head under the blankets, to avoid his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight. The Italian, who re&s;pected his re&s;t, waited up|on
<PB N="160" REF="030364_0163_0FE5D2F7A998E148">
the receiver, informing him that his dear ma&s;ter &s;eemed to be much indi&s;po&s;ed. Well, we'll go and &s;ee him, an&s;wered the latter; but don't let us lo&s;e time.</P>
<P>They both repaired to the apartment of their unfor|tunate victim. What ails you, my dear Alexis, &s;aid the receiver, are you not well? No, &s;ir, I am not; I &s;uffer very much indeed! Oh, my God! &s;end quickly for the doctor.</P>
<P>Sciocco di&s;patched in&s;tantly a &s;ervant of the hou&s;e, and returned to his ma&s;ter's bed &s;ide.</P>
<P>Why was you not with us la&s;t night, &s;aid Sciocco, you would have helped us to cha&s;ti&s;e a certain little gallant. Aye, replied the receiver, I &s;aw him enter at Sophia's; fury &s;eized my heart; I came to fetch Sci|occo, and we two gave him &s;uch a drubbing with our cudgels, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ure you as he will not forget as long as he lives.</P>
<P>No pen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to de&s;cribe the different &s;en&s;a|tions of Alexis during this conver&s;ation. The traitors! &s;aid he to him&s;elf, only &s;ee their cunning!</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician's arrival broke off their conver&s;ation. Alexis reque&s;ted to &s;peak in private with the di&s;ciple of E&s;culapius. Carlo and his friend quitted the apartment. Clara's lover opened the whole affair to the doctor, who&s;e gravity &s;eemed to excite confidence Sir, &s;aid he at the conclu&s;ion, I cannot live with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">utchers!&mdash;take me, I pray, take me from them! With plea|&s;ure! an&s;wered the doctor&mdash;&s;hould you like to be brought to my own hou&s;e?&mdash;Wherever you plea&s;e, &s;o I do not &s;ee my enemies.</P>
<P>The doctor &s;ent for his carriage; it arrived, and Alexis got into it, in &s;pite of Sciocco's complaints and remon&s;trances&mdash;which, far from being li&s;tened to by our patient, only &s;erved to redouble his indignation.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival at the doctor's, he was carried to an apartment, the door of which was kept locked.&mdash;Alex|is was determined to &s;ee Sciocco no more&mdash;he forbad him his premi&s;es, and earne&s;tly entreated his ho&s;t not to introduce him.</P>
<P>Poor Carlo was much grieved at the faults his ma&s;ter finds with him. How can you be &s;o unrea&s;onable, &s;aid
<PB N="161" REF="030364_0164_0FE5D2672C76DBB8">
the doctor, you that have put him&punc; in &s;uch a condition?</P>
<P>After a deal of argument with the doctor, Sciocco di&s;covered the cau&s;e of his illne&s;s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> went imme|diately to acquaint the receiver with what he had heard. The latter was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;urpri&s;ed and thought Alexis had concerted &s;ome &s;cheme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The receiver, to be circum&s;tantially informed of the whole, called on Sophia that very moment.&mdash;Treacherous woman! &s;aid he, I know all&mdash;Alexis has &s;educed you; you have both betrayed me!&mdash;O heav|en! cried Sophia, throwing her&s;elf at his feet, who could tell you this? I implore your clemency for him; he is not guilty; 'tis me alone! what is he not guil|ty? Perfidious woman! I have already taken venge|ance upon him; and, as to you, I renounce you, I de&s;|pi&s;e you forever! I de&s;pi&s;e you too much to take the trouble of puni&s;hing you! But leave this town; get out of my &s;ight, for fear of &s;ome unlucky moment! Begone! ungrateful wretch!</P>
<P>The receiver frowned once more at the guilty So|phia, left her apartment, and returned to his hou&s;e. From a remnant of commi&s;&s;eration, however, upon her unhappy &s;ituation, he &s;ent her the little coffer full of gold; and delivered afterwards to Sciocco, the &s;um of twenty-five louis d'ors, to pay his friend's phy&s;ician; commanding him particularly never to reveal the name of the per&s;on who had done him that favor; he then took leave of Sciocco, &s;tepped into his carriage, and departed for Paris;</P>
<P>In vain Sciocco went hourly to the door of Alexis' apartment; in vain he endeavored to convince the doctor of his repentance and attachment to his ma&s;|ter. The doctor him&s;elf made u&s;e of all his influence in favor of the poor Italian. Alexis remained inflexi|ble; every repre&s;entation &s;erved only to aggravate his re&s;entment; Sciocco's crime became only more con|genial to his irritated mind; he openly taxed him with a de&s;ign to murder him.</P>
<P>Alexis was &s;oon able to walk, and began to think of commencing his journey. Seeing him&s;elf well recov|ered, he ordered his effects to be brought and wi&s;hed to
<PB N="162" REF="030364_0165_0FE5D2FE25ECD108">
pay the doctor. It is u&s;ele&s;s, &s;aid the latter, I am paid. Paid! and who has paid you? That I mu&s;t not tell, &s;ir; I promi&s;ed to keep that &s;ecret. It was a fruitle&s;s attempt of Alexis to plague his memory to remind him&s;elf of the per&s;on who had rendered him this &s;ervice; he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be Sciocco; neverthe|le&s;s, remembering the treachery of which he accu&s;ed him, he re&s;olved to &s;et out without either &s;peaking to him, or even &s;uffering him to be admitted to his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, one fine morning, the &s;ky be|ing &s;erene and cloudle&s;s, Alexis took leave of his ho&s;ts, begging they would not acquaint Sciocco with his departure, and &s;et out on his journey to Paris.</P>
<P>He would not take po&s;t at Mar&s;eilles, for fear Sci|occo &s;hould find out by inquiries, what road he had taken. The conduct of this friend hung &s;o heavy up|on him, that he walked quite drooped, and with a world of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">in; tears even gu&s;hed from his eyes.&mdash;"Am I not the mo&s;t unfortunate of men! &s;aid he to him&s;elf,&mdash;whom can I tru&s;t?&mdash;to whom can I have recour&s;e?"</P>
<P>He was ab&s;orbed in the mo&s;t profound melancho|ly, when Sciocco, who had watched for him, threw him&s;elf at his feet; He embraced, and bedewed them with tears. Alexis &s;tarted, and &s;trove to avoid him, but the other hindered him by exclaiming with a mo&s;t woful and contrite tone of voice, Oh, my dear pat|ron! hear me! forgive me! What do&s;t thou want, wretch? How dare&s;t thou to &s;hew thy&s;elf to me after what you have been guilty of? Tho&s;e blows you mean! Oh! did you but know how often I cur&s;ed my&s;elf for them! I did not think I was &s;triking my good ma&s;ter! indeed I did not! Traitor, can you be &s;o impudent! By heaven, I did not know you! Who el&s;e did you think it could be? The receiver is as inno|cent as my&s;elf; he &s;aw a man, muffled up in a long cloak, enter Signora's hou&s;e; he took him for the old gallant of the fair one; jealou&s;y overcame him with rage; he came to me, engaged me to be the joint in|&s;trument of his wrath, and intended al&s;o to make you of the party; but I, who believed you was a&s;leep, did
<PB N="163" REF="030364_0166_0FE5D31ED7C32528">
not chu&s;e to di&s;turb you. We &s;et out, and find the &s;uppo&s;ed gallant, and it happened that the blows, in|&s;tead of being the reward of a traitor, fell upon my poor ma&s;ter! Now, is it our fault? could we gue&s;s it was you who was with your &s;cholar at an hour &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable? 'Tis a lie! It is not a lie, &s;ignior, it is the plain truth; a&s;k the doctor who cured you; What, did not you and the receiver know me? I &s;wear by all the powers, we did not!</P>
<P>Sciocco dropped many a tear; Alexis, &s;eeing him pro&s;trate at his feet, began to reflect, and accu&s;ed none but him&s;elf of what had happened: Carlo a&s;ked him with the mo&s;t genuine &s;implicity, My dear patron, won't you tell me what bu&s;ine&s;s you had with the dam|&s;el at &s;uch an hour? What le&s;&s;on had you to give her?</P>
<P>Alexis looked at Sciocco, and held out his hand to him, which the Italian ki&s;&s;ed with heartfelt tran&s;ports, exclaiming, Do you pardon me, dear Alexis? I think I ought, if you tell me the truth; Alas! I &s;ee all the fault lays on me! Yes, it does indeed! and on that good natured receiver, who mi&s;took you for his rival, and in&s;i&s;ted upon paying the expences of your phy&s;ician! Did he pay my phy&s;ician? He did, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Alexis embraced him, and recounted his &s;ecret con|ver&s;ation with Sophia. Sciocco &s;hewed him plainly how &s;he &s;ought to enthral him! and Alexis, &s;tung with remor&s;e, could hardly forgive him&s;elf. They both pur&s;ued their road, and longed to &s;ee Paris, where Alexis hoped to hear of his father and Dumont.</P>
<P>Since his departure from the cottage, he had gone through &s;o many adventures, and &s;u&s;tained &s;uch hard|&s;hips, as had &s;carcely left him time to think on his dear Clara. Sometimes, however, he would &s;hed tears at the remembrance of his parting from this dear object of his love: his imagination repre&s;ented her, as it were, in a &s;tate of forlornne&s;s; he heard her com|plaints, her reproaches, and this moving picture quite wrung his &s;oul.</P>
<P>We &s;hall only &s;top with our travellers at Vienna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> where they happen to have a very &s;ingular adven|ture, owing to the mi&s;tru&s;tful temper of Alexis.</P>
<P>In the du&s;k of the evening our two travellers, who
<PB N="164" REF="030364_0167_0FE5D2FF099E43D8">
might have gone a few leagues farther before night, found them&s;elves &s;o much &s;pent with the fatigue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their journey, as to enter an inn with an intent to &s;pend the evening, but not to &s;leep there all night. They were conducted to an apartment, and &s;at down to conver&s;e with one another: &s;uddenly they hear a &s;trange noi&s;e in the room: their door was &s;hut, they were alone, and yet they heard &s;omebody breathe near them, and a low re&s;trained coughing. There is &s;omebody in our room, cried Sciocco. Yes, replied Alexis, there is &s;omebody hidden.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, they &s;earch on all &s;ides, they open a cup|board, and find a man laying on the floor, and trem|bling like a leaf. What bu&s;ine&s;s have you here? &s;aid our two travellers, putting them&s;elves at the &s;ame time upon the defen&s;ive. Ah! gentlemen, don't un|do me! an&s;wered the &s;tranger; I am a wretch, pur|&s;ued by the ju&s;t vengeance of a man whom I have in|humanly &s;acrificed; he is now at this inn; I &s;aw him come in, and quickly hid my&s;elf in this apartment, the door of which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound open. You have other de|&s;igns, villain! I tell thee leave this room! Ah! by all that is dear to you, &s;ave me, extricate me! I am no villain; and if I am guilty of a crime, it is love only that made me commit it. Oh! &s;uffer me to &s;pend the night with you! you &s;hall know who I am&mdash;you &s;hall have an account of the whole affair! What, &s;hould we &s;uffer a &s;tranger? If you turn me out, you undo me! If my enemy di&s;covers me here, my life is lo&s;t! Alas, let me owe you my pre&s;ervation generous &s;trangers! deign to keep me for this night; to-morrow, when my rival &s;hall be gone, I will go too.</P>
<P>Sciocco was very willing to befriend the &s;tranger; but Alexis, afraid, perhaps not without rea&s;on, of all the bad con&s;equences which might have re&s;ulted from harboring a man he had found hidden in his room, would by no means have acceded to his reque&s;t. In vain Sciocco attempted to prove that it was in the or|der of things, and of prede&s;tination; in vain the &s;tran|ger has recour&s;e to entreaties and tears. Alexis, who had &s;o often been put upon, &s;u&s;pects &s;ome fraud in the
<PB N="165" REF="030364_0168_0FE5D31F9B9A9EB0">
bu&s;ine&s;s, opens the door, and calls the landlord.</P>
<P>At the noi&s;e he made, the &s;tranger attempted to e&s;cape; but another appeared before the door of the apartment, who &s;topped him, and cried, Hah! have I found the object of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ury, and immediately thru&s;t his &s;word in his bo&s;om. What became of Alexis and his friend at this &s;pectacle of horror! They &s;ee the un|happy victim fall, and impute his death to none but them&s;elves; and the hou&s;e re&s;ounded with the cries and complaints of the people who came in crowds. Alexis and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iocco, fearing to be compromi&s;ed in that cruel affair leave the inn, and pa&s;s through the crowds that had gathered round the hou&s;e, and take, with the utmo&s;t precipitancy, the road to Lyons. Having marched to the di&s;tance of about three leagues, they are overtaken by two men on hor&s;eback. One of them alighted, and addre&s;&s;ed them in a mo&s;t furious tone, So, you have been the accomplices of the wretch I have killed?&mdash;We!&mdash;Yes, you! he was hidden in your apartment. Villain! cried Alexis, fear the due &s;earch of that ju&s;tice, thou &s;eeme&s;t to have evaded! Forbear in&s;ulting an unfortunate young man, who will be &s;orry all his life time for the crime which he has given thee an opportunity to commit.</P>
<P>The cavalier and his valet make an attempt to at|tack Alexis and Sciocco with their pi&s;tols, but the lat|ter di&s;arm them, and begin a pugili&s;tic combat, in which the four champions di&s;play equal &s;trength and dexterity.</P>
<P>The night was not very dark, and the battle being fought before a ca&s;tle, made &s;everal per&s;ons come to the windows to be &s;pectators to an action mo&s;t &s;pirited and vigorous.</P>
<P>Alexis and Sciocco knocked down their adver&s;aries, &s;uffered them to ri&s;e again, &s;et too and wor&s;ted them. This &s;ingular combat would have la&s;ted much longer, had it not been interrupted by a particular accident. It happened that Sciocco, elated with the hopes of in|&s;tant victory, exclaimed, Don't flinch! courage, A|lexis!&mdash;Alexis! cried a lady, who was looking out of one of the windows of the ca&s;tle; What, is it he? is it that dear lad? fly to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance!</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="030364_0169_0FE5D300641B1E48">
That moment, a whole troop of valets, armed with cudgels, leave the ca&s;tle, fall upon the four champions, and &s;trike both the aggre&s;&s;ors and the aggre&s;&s;ed. Our two heroes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide with this unexpected reinforcement, and charged the hor&s;emen with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity as to make them fly, and leave them conquer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.</P>
<P>Alexis received a blow in his face, which quite di&s;|figured him: the blood flows: he &s;tops it with his handkerchief; Sciocco and the valets of the ca&s;tle &s;upport him. The &s;ub&s;idiary dame arrived, and took him by the hand, and made him enter the ca&s;tle. What, is it you, my dear Alexis? Good God! you will not e&s;cape from me this time.</P>
<P>Alexis is &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment; he wonders who may be this lady that &s;hows him &s;uch concern.</P>

<P>WHILST the ex-capuchin and the barone&s;s were thus contending about Clara, a phaeton &s;topt on the high road. The generous &s;tranger who was &s;itting in it, heard the cries of Clara, and alighted from the vehicle. He advanced immediately with his valet, to the &s;pot, where Clara hoped a &s;peedy relief from her per&s;ecutors. What are you doing to this young man, cried he? (The reader will remember that Clara di&s;gui&s;ed in men's clothes, had made the conque&s;t of the barone&s;s, under the name of Alexis) What is it to you, an&s;wers the father?

<P>Clara thanked the receiver (for it was he) with &s;in|cerity, &s;weetne&s;s, and innocence. She then gave a faithful account of her adventures; mentioned her father Duverly, and Candor, de&s;cribed the cottage, and by all this obtained the entire confidence of her de|liverer, who was a man highly re&s;pectable. During this conver&s;ation, they arrived at Lyons, where they made a &s;tay of &s;everal days, to &s;ee all that was curi|ous and remarkable in that city. Nothing very ma|terial having occurred in their way from Lyons to Pa|ris, I &s;hall not tre&s;pa&s;s upon the reader's time with unintere&s;ting details, and enter the metropolis with our two travellers, who alight at the hotel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In France, the hou&s;es of noblemen, and per&s;ons in high of|fice are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>Hotels.</HI></NOTE>of the marquis de Cor&s;agne, the receiver's friend, who makes a con&s;picuous figure in the remaining part of this hi&s;|tory.</P>
<P>The marquis was about forty, tall, well made, and amiable. He had &s;uffered &s;o much by misfortune, that his countenance was overca&s;t by a melancholy gloom, which nothing could di&s;pel.</P>
<P>Arzelia, marchione&s;s de Cor&s;agne, had nearly ob|tained her &s;eventh lu&s;tre; &s;he had &s;till the appearance of a woman who had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by exqui&s;ite beauty; and though her eyes flu&s;hed no more with glances of juvenile vivacity, though her cheeks and features had been &s;orrowed by torrents of tears, though &s;he had lo&s;t the &s;educing attractives which at fir&s;t &s;ight captivate the heart, yet her &s;oul was refined, her temper gentle, and her mind ingenuous and upright. The lo&s;s of her external charms only helped to heigh|ten the brilliant qualities of her noble heart. Thus the panting ro&s;e, faded by the ardency of a &s;ummer's

day, the fickle butterfly approaches, and quickly leaves her for another flower, who&s;e full blown charms and &s;weet perfumes attract the coquetting in&s;ect; but the prudent bee is not deterred by the decayed appear|ance of the queen of flowers; &s;he reverently opens her calyx, &s;ure to find in it a nectar more precious than the u&s;ele&s;s perfume &s;he has lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The receiver whom we &s;hall forthwith denote by the name of Du Monay, had intimated to Clara, be|fore he pre&s;ented her to his noble friends, that it would not be proper to acquaint them with her adventures. Much have they &s;uffered by misfortune, added he; &s;uch a confidence would only &s;harpen the edge of their grief; and with regard to the hi&s;tory of the cot|tage, to that Alexis who never knew his family, all this appears &s;o &s;ingular, &s;o romantic, as might in all likelihood, le&s;&s;en the favorable opinion to which your merits lay &s;o ju&s;t a claim. Pardon my plainne&s;s Clara, you have given me leave to &s;peak with the tenderne&s;s of a father; I &s;hall exerci&s;e the paternal prerogative; nay I do now, and in te&s;timony of my friend&s;hip, I will introduce you to my friends, as my neice, as my brother's daughter; they know that I was to take her with me to Paris, but they know not that &s;he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> no more: take you her place, and be &s;ure, the mar|chione&s;s will bring you up as her own daughter.</P>
<P>Clara had not the lea&s;t objection to make Paris her place of re&s;idence; yet &s;he regretted the cottage. Many times thinking on Candor, &s;he accu&s;ed her&s;elf of cruelty and ingratitude, and promi&s;ed to return to a man, who had fulfilled every duty of a parent to|wards her; but the bare idea of what he exacted from Alexis, the vengeance he had meditated again&s;t Du|verly, and her own&s;elf, his daughter, made her &s;hud|der, &s;he trembled with indignation, and prai&s;ed the powers above for having re&s;cued her from a blood|thir&s;ty tyrant. Neverthele&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, to her&s;elf, one day, Alexis may return to the cottage, and not find|ing me there&mdash;The que&s;tion is will he &s;eek me? This que&s;tion I will not decide.

No; I had rather &s;tay in Paris. In my deliverer I have found a real father, and can the friends to whom he means to introduce me, be of an inferior &s;tamp? No, I will never leave tho&s;e gene|rous hearts; I will live happy far from my relations; but what &s;ay I?&mdash;Is not the place which gives happi|ne&s;s, the real bo&s;om of the family?</P>
<P>This was the wi&s;e determination of Clara: Arriv|ed at the marquis' hotel, the porter &s;hows our travel|lers into a beautiful &s;aloon, where the marquis was reading&punc; and his &s;pou&s;e amu&s;ing her&s;elf on the piano forte. They no &s;ooner perceived M. du Monay, than they fly to his arms. It is you, my dear friend &s;aid the marquis, it is you? how happy I am to &s;ee you again.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s expre&s;&s;ed no le&s;s the joy &s;he felt at this meeting, and M. Du Monay laying hold of Clara's hand, pre&s;ented her to the noble ho&s;ts. Here you &s;ee, my neice Clara, my brother's daughter. You have offered me your hou&s;e to receive her; that I make bold to accept your propo&s;al, there &s;he is; Arzelia, what can be more lovely?</P>
<P>Clara blu&s;hed and ca&s;t down her blue eyes: the marchione&s;s begs her to be &s;eated by her: yes, &s;aid the noble lady, yes my dear, I adopt you as my daughter: our friend's niece will find again a father and a moth|er in us! what a pretty creature! Come mode&s;t Cla|ra, let us &s;ee tho&s;e pretty blue eyes; come embrace me.</P>
<P>Clara flies to the arms of her new protectre&s;s, who, in conjunction with her con&s;ort, lavi&s;hed the mo&s;t ten|der and affectionate care&s;&s;es upon her. Dinner was &s;erved afterwards. Clara conquered &s;omewhat of her natural timidity: &s;he &s;ung; the marchione&s;s accom|panied her on the piano forte, and the day was entire|ly &s;pent in conver&s;ation, and the &s;weets of friendly re|creations.</P>
<P>M. Du Monay who only came to Paris to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs, &s;et out a fortnight after to Mar&s;eilles, whither his function called him. Previous to his de|parture,

he recommended his dear neice to his good friends: but he might have &s;aved him&s;elf that trouble. Clara by her gentlene&s;s and accompli&s;hments had al|ready ingratiated her&s;elf &s;o much, that the noble pair ab&s;olutely con&s;idered her as their daughter.</P>
<P>Clara &s;aw, not without tears, the departure of her worthy friend; and though &s;he was fully aware of the happine&s;s &s;he would enjoy with her new parents, yet without him, &s;he looked upon her&s;elf as bani&s;hed to a de&s;ert. In con&s;equence, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak to him in private. Will you leave us, father &s;aid &s;he?&mdash;I mu&s;t my dear niece!&mdash;Oh! my be&s;t uncle, how &s;hall I be able to endure your ab&s;ence?&mdash;In obtaining the friend|&s;hip of the generous ho&s;ts, who will &s;oon make you for|get me!&mdash;No, never! never!&mdash;Farewell, Clara.

O never mind, let him know what you have done for me&mdash;your genero&s;ity, your friend&s;hip do me too much honor to conceal them; Well, let us come to the point!

<P>They parted; Clara was melting in tears; but the marchione&s;s who &s;urpri&s;ed her in that condition, took her to an apartment, and tried to &s;tifle her &s;or|row by a thou&s;and little amu&s;ements, which did not fail producing the de&s;ired effect.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>ALEXIS AND HIS FRIEND LEAVE THE BARONESS' CASTLE.&mdash;THE HERMITAGE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FIRST of all it will be nece&s;&s;ary to inform my readers (if they have not gue&s;&s;ed it already) who was the lady of the ca&s;tle, that could not without enthu&s;ia&s;m, utter the name of Alexis. He mu&s;t re|member, that Clara, by the &s;ame name, had made a conque&s;t of the heart of the barone&s;s of Yrace! It was before her ca&s;tle, the battle between Alexis, Sciocco, and the &s;trangers had commenced; and it was that fooli&s;h old woman, who, upon hearing the name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> young hero, had, mi&s;taken him for the Alexis who de&s;erted from her a few days &s;ince.</P>
<P>Alexis &s;tops the blood which gu&s;hes from the wound he has received in his face, and the barone&s;s not having examined him well, per&s;everes in her no|tion, and orders him to be put into an excellent bed. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lia, &s;aid &s;he to her woman, I could not &s;ee his wound without fainting! poor child! go and dre&s;s it&mdash;to|morrow morning I &s;hall &s;ee how he does, and &s;hall my&s;elf bring him his breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>In fact the <HI>femme de chambre,</HI> who had but newly en|tered the &s;ervice of the barone&s;s, goes up &s;tairs to Alexis's apartment, and by dint of applications to the patient's face, covered it &s;o much, that his no&s;e, eyes, and mouth, were the only parts left vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Sciocco, who &s;tood by his friend's bed &s;ide, gaped with a&s;toni&s;hment; and though he did not know the motive of all this, yet he failed not to attribute it within him&s;elf, to the order of things and prede&s;tina|tion. When every body had left the apartment, <HI>mio caro padrone,</HI> &s;aid he, will you &s;ay now that hazard brought you to this ca&s;tle?

twice, went down &s;tairs to the old lady, and ate with a mo&s;t hearty appetite, the provi&s;ion of his ho&s;t.</P>

O, but I know better, where did he come from ju&s;t now? where did you get ac|quainted with him? have you had any di&s;pute? who were the aggre&s;&s;ors?</P>
<P>The barone&s;s would never have put an end to her que&s;tions; and Sciocco, who plainly &s;aw that &s;he mi&s;took his ma&s;ter for &s;ome other per&s;on, was at a lo&s;s what an&s;wer to make, &s;o great was his apprehen|&s;ion of being di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his good birth. The ba|rone&s;s, who, for her own part, did not know what to make of Carlo's <HI>jargon;</HI> imagined that he was <HI>non compos mentis,</HI> and the blows he received in the com|bat mu&s;t have di&s;ordered his &s;en&s;es. After &s;upper Sciocco returned to our hero's apartment, and repeat|ed the conver&s;ation which he had ju&s;t had with the ho&s;te&s;s, a&s;ked him what he thought of it. Alexis, who was not framed for fal&s;ehood, promi&s;ed, that, on the next morning, he would di&s;cover him&s;elf to the barone&s;s, and rather quit her hou&s;e than &s;uffer her any longer to remain in her mi&s;taken notions.</P>
<P>At the break of day the old lady went up to her patient, who&s;e face &s;he did not know, on account of the lint applied to it by Julia; &s;he &s;at down by him, and addre&s;&s;ed him in the following words: "So, you ungrateful little man, I have you again in my ca&s;tle. I ought not to feel the lea&s;t concern for you, &s;ince you

behaved &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly towards me; but&mdash;my indul|gence&mdash;my weakne&s;s&mdash;you know me;&mdash;you know well my feeling heart?"

Indeed I hardly know you again.&mdash;I believe you, madam, be|cau&s;e I never had the honor of being known to you.&mdash;Ah! you di&s;&s;emble; cruel creature! you are &s;or|ry that fate has brought you to my feet; you mean to&mdash;but the artifice is too palpable; I have got thee a gain, little wretch, and never more &s;halt thou leave this place. It is all over, thou art with me for life.</P>
<P>Alexis, frightened at this menace, was going to re|ply, when the barone&s;s being informed that &s;omebody de&s;ired to &s;peak to her below, &s;uddenly left the apart|ment. It was one of her farmers who had come to &s;ettle &s;ome accounts with her lady&s;hip, which would not &s;uffer her to return to her young patient. Scioc|co had exhau&s;ted his whole rhetoric during that inter|val, to convince Alexis that it was very lucky for him to be thus mi&s;taken for another. Alexis rejected his arguments. His &s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;ition even made him find in the old lady's conduct, &s;ome &s;ecret end, which did not alarm him a little; he imagined that &s;he mu&s;t have &s;ome violent de&s;ign upon him. If not, &s;aid he to Carlo, we are fallen in a den of ruffians. What can &s;he want of me? why does that woman threaten me with perpetual confinement? Oh! I will be free this very night! Is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould think &s;o, <HI>mio padrone?</HI> Po&s;&s;ible you &s;ay! don't you ob&s;erve in the barone&s;s and all her dome&s;tics, an air of &s;avage|ne&s;s, an air &s;o &s;ingular?&mdash;Why, I believe they look much like every body; only ob&s;erve them, Sciocco. Joke apart, I am not ea&s;y in this place.&mdash;This is a|nother in&s;tance of the effect of your prejudices, your fears, your &s;u&s;picions; But let us be &s;hort;&mdash;why &s;hould I be kept here in &s;pite of my&s;elf?&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e it is in the order of things. Sciocco, I perceive &s;ome fatal omens! Come, let us get out of this place.&mdash;But, your wound?&mdash;My wound, hey?&mdash;Only look how dangerous it is?</P>

Alexis, at the&s;e words, throws off the dre&s;&s;ing, ri&s;es and taking Sciocco by the hand, they both de&s;cend in|to the garden, walk acro&s;s it, find a little gate open from the field-&s;ide, and run as fa&s;t as they can! The &s;ky became in&s;en&s;ibly more cloudy, and a thick ob|&s;curity, which, covering the earth, &s;eemed to indicate to our travellers a fa&s;t approaching and inevitable &s;torm.</P>
<P>After having &s;trayed for a while through windings, bu&s;hes, ditches, &amp;c. the mo&s;t vivid fla&s;hes of lightning rent the ea&s;tern &s;ky, and which were &s;ucceeded by the loude&s;t claps of thunder; already &s;ome little drops of rain, preceded the torrents of hail and &s;howers that were to follow. Alexis and Sciocco continued their march with indefatigable ha&s;te, yet the &s;ilence, the night, the awful horrors of nature, congealed their frame with involuntary &s;hiverings; in vain did they attempt to advance farther in their cour&s;e, an ex|treme weakne&s;s &s;lackened their nerves, their knees tottered, they could neither breathe, nor &s;upport the weight of their bodies.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>SCIOCCO RESOLVES TO TURN HERMIT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHY has Heaven, that endowed us with the faculty of the mind, made it &s;ubject to &s;o ma|ny different affections? Some are men of parts and not of judgment; others have too much fore&s;ight and penetration; the former are only remarkable for a knowledge &s;uited to the moment: the latter are &s;im|ple, timid, credulous, and become exalted, if time is left them for reflection. So multivious is the ca&s;t of the human mind!&mdash;prejudices make it fal&s;e and captious; vanity renders it rediculous; timidity de|pre&s;&s;es its powers; in a word, it is &s;ubordinate to the peculiarities of all the pa&s;&s;ions that can effect the heart. For in&s;tance: Alexis and Sciocco are both di&s;tingui&s;hed by the gift of rea&s;on; but how oblique are their views! One cannot believe in good nature and frankne&s;s, and is furni&s;hed with a &s;ufficiency of ar|guments to &s;upport his opinion. The other is too con|fiding, too open, too much governed by fal&s;e maxims and erroneous &s;y&s;tems, and his principles are not ill-propped. All that happens to the one, does con|firm him in his ideas; and all that is felt by the other does coincide with his way of thinking; both argue plau&s;ibly, and both are mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>O human frailty, how amazing are thy deviations!&mdash;Logic, morality, philo&s;ophy, metaphy&s;ics, all the&s;e high &s;ciences, are like &s;o many perfidious guides, who will only involve the deeper into the labyrinth of &s;o|phi&s;try. He that gives the be&s;t proofs, is not always he that &s;ees be&s;t: learning and eloquence are the only merits which rai&s;e him above the vulgar. He has u&s;ed his efforts to con&s;olidate his opinion; he will ever bring you over to his party: but does it imply, that his opi|nion is the ju&s;te&s;t?&mdash;To illu&s;trate this I &s;hall adduce no other example than that of the two philo&s;ophers, who &s;poke by turns; one in favor of ab&s;tinence, and the other in favor of high living. A day being ap|pointed
<PB N="181" REF="030364_0184_0FE5D26B14AEB550">
for each to preach his doctrine; the people fa&s;ted on the day they left the former; and, as &s;oon as they had heard the epicurean, gave them&s;elves up to the mo&s;t brutal exce&s;&s;es of debauchery.</P>
<P>Thus every one has a mind of his own, opinions of his own, and a peculiar way of viewing things; the be&s;t is that which is mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with equity and rea&s;on. The man who gives all his admiration to the law of nature, is a man of learning, void of common &s;en&s;e: he that follows and re&s;pects the civil law, is a philo&s;opher endowed with upright &s;en&s;e and &s;ound judgment; yet, notwith&s;tanding, both are in the right: whence that difference?</P>
<P>Alexis had now lo&s;t a good deal of his mi&s;tru&s;t, and if I am allowed to &s;ay, of his &s;u&s;ceptibility. O|bliged to live with men, and what is wor&s;e &s;till, to be in want of them, he was &s;en&s;ible that he brought up|on him&s;elf all the misfortunes that had befallen him &s;ince he fir&s;t left the cottage. The adventure of the drubbing, that of the man killed in the inn at Vienna, and per|haps that of the barone&s;s, whom he had quitted too precipitately, made him acquire experience, and feel the &s;ting of remor&s;e; be it as it will, the receiver at Mar|&s;eilles whom he &s;u&s;pected &s;o much, was the mo&s;t hon|e&s;t and generous man, of which he had &s;elf evident proofs. His Sophia was a deceitful creature, whom he had fooli&s;hly con&s;idered as virtuous; the &s;tranger at the inn neither was a thief nor an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; he had undone him, he had delivered him into the hands of his butcher!&mdash;How much did Alexis feel the weight of this crime!&mdash;What an inclination had he to be|lieve and oblige every body! Perhaps it is to be feared, that the murder has made too forcible an im|pre&s;&s;ion upon him. A mi&s;tru&s;ting character, if it be once corrected by the &s;uperior force of example; if it feel too many rude &s;hocks, will frequently become &s;ub|ject to credulou&s;ne&s;s and imprudence; extremes are never &s;o di&s;tant as we might &s;uppo&s;e them to be.</P>
<P>On the other hand he lived with Sciocco, who&s;e fooli&s;h good-nature, who&s;e erroneous moral &s;y&s;tem made him often lo&s;e patience: compelled to contra|dict
<PB N="182" REF="030364_0185_0FE5D308C04152A8">
his fal&s;e opinions, he in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t his own, and this indignation of the mind has the &s;ame effect upon him as a wi&s;e and enlightened Mentor.</P>
<P>We &s;hall go farther with the&s;e reflections, which mu&s;t be obvious to the reader who has followed my hero in his adventures and errors. If he be &s;orry to find faults in him (faults which re&s;ulted from the man|ner in which he was brought up, he will &s;oon &s;ee him gentle, amiable, affable and judicious; but he mu&s;t be taught a little more in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, before he can reach that end.</P>
<P>We have left him with his good friend Carlo, in the middle of a &s;tormy night both &s;heltered in a kind of a de&s;olate hermitage, where they &s;ee nobody; but where a thou&s;and in&s;criptions on the walls, demon&s;trate plain|ly that the hermit knows Alexis.</P>
<P>However, the anchorite does not appear! Has he left his a&s;ylum, is he dead, is he hidden in &s;ome cave? Alexis and Sciocco make the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch all over the place; they find them&s;elves alone, ab&s;olute|ly alone, in the hermitage.&mdash;But why was the door o|pen? Who has lighted the lamp? Their wavering minds were lo&s;t in doubts and conjectures: in &s;hort, they are ma&s;ters of the place; they may wait till the &s;torm has &s;ub&s;ided, &s;pend the night in it, nay, make it their re&s;idence as long as they plea&s;e. Sciocco propo&s;|ed to his ma&s;ter to lay down to &s;leep upon a bench. Alexis is willing, and they betake them&s;elves to re&s;t;&mdash;no &s;ooner had &s;leep clo&s;ed their eye lids, than a mo&s;t tremendous peal of thunder made them ri&s;e in a pan|ic from the arms of Morpheus. Poor Sciocco thinks the frail &s;tructure is going to be hurled down&mdash;Alexis removes his fears; the Italian commences fre&s;h prayers, and Clara's lover, &s;pent with fatigue, cau&s;ed by the &s;mart of his wounds, &s;oon enjoys a calm and profound &s;leep.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner dawn had di&s;pelled the tempe&s;tuous clouds, than Alexis awaking, and not a little &s;urpri&s;|ed at &s;eeing a man in a fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r's habit, &s;tand clo&s;e by him: he already takes him for the hermit, and pre|pares to make an apology for his intru&s;ion. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE TWENTY-FIVE LOUIS D'ORS OF JOHN PICOT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THEIR fir&s;t care&punc; upon entering the inn, was to enquire for John Picot. John makes his appear|ance: Sciocco delivers his uncle's letter, and Alexis, always occupied with his hermit, began to enquire af|ter him. Oons, an&s;wered John, he was an odd fellow, that father Hilary; you ju&s;t put me in mind of him; oh! I am very &s;orry for him. Pray give me &s;ome particular account of that man?&mdash;Only think, &s;ir, that father Hilary, who with permi&s;&s;ion of the Arch-Bi&s;hop, has now been a twelvemonth in the hermitage you have &s;een; did nothing all that time, but lamented one Alexis; for whom he was highly concerned. I heard him often &s;peak of the young man; becau&s;e as my ma&s;ter was a very charitable &s;oul, &s;ent him every day his victuals, and it was I who carried it. "Alexis," he &s;aid many times, "Alexis you accu&s;e me; alas! I am innocent. If you are in di&s;tre&s;s, I am &s;o too, and perhaps much more than you. What mu&s;t you have thought of my conduct towards you? poor youth, how fond he was of me! how he re&s;pected me. I &s;hall never &s;ee you again; I am but too much con|vinced that I &s;hall die far from you: ah! what a world of torments!" It was thus father Hilary would always fret. A few days ago, the very Alexis whom he loved &s;o much, put up at this inn, with a &s;tranger, whom I believe, was his father. At fir&s;t, not knowing his name, I took no notice of him; the young man and his friend, &s;tayed here about a &s;e'n-night to &s;ee the city. I attended them to every place curious or remarkable, it was only the day before ye&s;|terday, at the very moment they &s;et off, that I heard the old gentleman call the lad Alexis. Alexis, &s;aid I Alexis; good God &s;hould that be the unfortunate youth who&s;e deplorable fate father Hilary &s;o often be|moans. I waited on father Hilary, and de&s;cribed the &s;tranger&mdash;he knew him. "It is he," cried the old man, "It is he; he goes to Paris; I will follow him

and find him there;&mdash;O &s;upreme happine&s;s! my love|ly youth, are we to meet again."</P>
<P>Father Hilary begged me to bring him &s;ome clothes: I gave him my own; he throws his habit in a corner, dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in great ha&s;te, thanks me, and takes leave of his abode. "O precious man&s;ion," &s;aid he, "floors which I have &s;o often &s;prinkled with my tears; walls bear a thou&s;and times the name of my friend, and repeat it on all &s;ides to my eyes, fare ye well! I quit you, hallowed premi&s;&s;es, where I lived far from honors, far from tho&s;e who have u&s;ed me ill;&mdash;Be ever a &s;helter to the erring or fatigued wanderer; receive him, let him find &s;helter under thy ru&s;tic roof, again&s;t the &s;torms or heat of the day: &s;peak to his eyes, tell him, that you were the receptacle of an unhappy man, and may this temple, &s;acred to friend&s;hip in de&s;pair, in|&s;truct the &s;ympathizing vi&s;itors, how &s;weet and un|fortunate it is to be born with a feeling heart."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words he lights his lamp for the la&s;t time, to illuminate once more his hermitage. I will remem|ber, thee, &s;aid he, upon my journey,; the idea of its being u&s;eful to &s;ome erring traveller will keep up my &s;pirits;&mdash;From this you &s;ee, &s;ir, that father Hilary was not altogether right in his under&s;tanding. Notwith|&s;tanding he was a good &s;oul, and very fond of me. How often would he &s;ay, young man you fully comfort the afflicted; you will be happy, my friend you will be happy: In &s;hort, to &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity, I have to inform you, that father Hilary, dre&s;t as &s;imple as I am now, &s;et out ye&s;terday about four in the afternoon, Being too poor to take po&s;t, he is obliged to perform the whole journey to Paris on foot, and beg alms of the charitable: he hopes to find his Alexis in the capital, and will &s;pare no pains to di&s;cover him. Now, gen|tlemen, is this all you de&s;ire to know? I can give no farther information, as I know no more. Moreover, am I at lo&s;s, about the mutual concerns between the hermit and Alexis; but I find the latter is very ami|able, oh, very amiable.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e of John &s;urpri&s;ed Clara's lover, in a &s;ingular manner. Who, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, can be that other Alexis, that overturns all the world like me, and

Father Hilary&mdash;I know nothing of a father Hilary&mdash;His language is, however &s;trictly relative to my &s;ituation.

What a cruel enigma, who will clear it up? who will explain it to me?</P>
<P>Alexis and Sciocco, go up &s;tairs to the apartment which has been prepared for them. Next to them on the &s;ame floor, lived an old man of a very re&s;pectable appearance; he pa&s;&s;es and greets his new neighbors, but hearing the name of Alexis mentioned, he ap|proaches quite &s;oftly, to li&s;ten to their conver&s;ation. Little by little, penetrated with the mo&s;t lively con|cern&mdash;he enters, and addre&s;&s;es our two friends with the&s;e words: "Excu&s;e an old man's curio&s;ity, amia|ble &s;trangers, I heard you more than once pronounce the name of Alexis&mdash;Don't you know that young man, who was here a few days ago?" Indeed, &s;ir, this very que&s;tion we meant to a&s;k you&mdash;I do not know him, and am very &s;orry for it. Hear my &s;tory, "I have now been three weeks in this inn, and intend leaving it &s;oon. The young man we are &s;peaking of, came to live in your chamber, with a &s;tranger much older than him&s;elf. I have &s;een that lovely Alexis, and his a&s;pect excited a very &s;ingular &s;entiment in me, for which I cannot account&mdash;His features put me in mind of tho&s;e of a woman whom I loved once: It was ju&s;t as if I had &s;een her before me!&mdash;The &s;ame eyes, the &s;ame mouth, the &s;ame tone of voice; in a word, Alexis is her living portrait. You judge what I mu&s;t feel at this &s;triking re&s;emblance. A hundred

times I &s;ought an opportunity to &s;peak to him; it nev|er offered it&s;elf, and he &s;et out without my being able to a&s;k him a &s;ingle que&s;tion. Ju&s;t now, gentlemen, you &s;poke of him, and I could not refrain my curio&s;ity; yet, excu&s;e me, I am &s;en&s;ible of my indi&s;cretion. I will withdraw my&s;elf." "No &s;ir," an&s;wered Clara's lover, detaining the old man, "no, &s;tay&mdash;I am as cu|rious as you to know that young man&punc; for I mu&s;t tell you, he bears my name, and I have now been &s;everal times taken for him." "Methinks you, gentlemen, know no more of him than I do: yet, be as it will, he is an engaging being&mdash;Alas! thou whom I adore &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, &s;hould it be thee: &s;houlde&s;t thou return in the form of an angel to charm all mankind?&mdash;O how that Alexis &s;truck me; good God, how he &s;truck me."</P>
<P>It would be doing an injury to the reader's penetra|tion, to remind him it was Clara, who during her &s;tay at Lyons with the receiver, and always going by the name of Alexis had created that ferment in the mind of the old man, John Picot, and the hermit. I &s;hall therefore dwell no longer on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This was the conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time between Alexis, Sciocco and the old man, hereup|on the latter retired, and the Italian going below to order &s;ome little matters, Alexis was quite alone. A moment after, being deeply engaged in thought, he believed he heard the voice of Sciocco, expo&s;tulating in a &s;pirited &s;train with John, in an adjoining pa&s;&s;age. "What," &s;aid John, "is your ma&s;ter &s;o rich as not to be in need of twenty-five louis d'ors?" "Quite the rever&s;e, <HI>Signor genero&s;o;</HI> twenty-five louis d'ors, in this pre&s;ent moment, would be of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to us. Neverthele&s;s we intend to-morrow, to demand a bene|fit concert in the city, that will fetch us rather better than twenty-five louis d'ors.". "But pray don't I an|ticipate your wi&s;hes by offering them thus to you in|&s;tantly, without any father ceremony?" "<HI>Certamente,</HI> if my ma&s;ter had no objection; but I know him; the expedient will vex him, he will never agree to it."</P>
<P>Here the two interlocutors &s;poke lower, &s;o that A|lexis could not hear the end of their conver&s;ation but
<PB N="191" REF="030364_0194_0FE5D2D54B675F60">
little as he had heard, did not fail to cau&s;e him &s;ome inquietude&mdash;"What are tho&s;e twenty five louis d'ors propo&s;ed to Sciocco? How can he take them, he that knows how much I &s;corn obligations? Is it John? How can that lad be ma&s;ter of &s;uch a &s;um; on what terms does he offer it?"</P>
<P>Already his imagination was &s;et to work, he enter|tained a thou&s;and &s;u&s;picions, all without foundation, when Sciocco, who entered, interrupted him in his re|veries. He thought to &s;ee Carlo con&s;trained and em|barra&s;&s;ed&mdash;He dares not look at his ma&s;ter, who, for his own part examined him, without a&s;king him the &s;malle&s;t que&s;tion. The good natured Sciocco endeav|ors to &s;peak; he is unable. Finally while Alexis is walking up and down in the chamber, Sciocco &s;eizing the moment when he turned his back, pulls &s;omething out of his pocket, and thur&s;ts it carefully into the little bag, which contains their effects. He goes out after|wards with the &s;tronge&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion, that what he had done e&s;caped his friend's ob&s;ervation; yet Alexis had ob&s;erved all; a gla&s;s reproducing objects, &s;hows him Sciocco hiding with anxious care a parcel. What can it be? Alexis wi&s;hed not to in&s;i&s;t upon knowing the cau&s;e of his friend's embarra&s;&s;ment, and during his ab&s;ence, he ventures to &s;earch the bag. This may probably be con&s;trued as an act of indi&s;cretion; but was not Alexis mi&s;tru&s;ting, fearful, and timed? Sci|occo who, till then, had &s;ecreted nothing from him, had ju&s;t manife&s;ted a di&s;&s;imulation, which alarmed him. After all, Alexis without deliberation, &s;earches the bag, and finds a rouleau of twenty-five louis d'ors, which he had heard mentioned!&mdash;Judge of his a&s;ton|i&s;hment.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce time to put the my&s;terious rouleau in its former place, than the little old man, his neigh|bor, enters the chamber, quite out of breath. Ah, &s;ir; Ah my neighbor&mdash;What is the matter, &s;ir?&mdash;I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">!&mdash;robbed! Yes: I left my door open, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> entered my room, and &s;tole fifty louis d'ors. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">!</P>
<P>Alexis falls down in a &s;woon; the old man endea|vors to give him a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he calls out for help; no|body

appears. Alexis, by dint of care, brings, back the unfortunate youth, who, not doubting that John and the Italian committed the theft, knew not what to &s;ay or do in that &s;ad cri&s;is; neverthele&s;s, he is alone with the &s;tranger, who&s;e phy&s;iognomy is equally hon|e&s;t and re&s;pectable! the place; his confidence; and emotion of heart, all encourages Alexis: he throws him&s;elf at the &s;tranger's feet. Sir, O &s;ir, don't undo him: it is he: Heavens, &s;hall I go on! Take this twenty-five, &s;ir! it is his &s;hare; don't undo him!</P>
<P>The old man was quite at a lo&s;s how to interpret the confu&s;ion of Alexis: &s;ome words, however take the veil from his under&s;tanding; What! unhappy young man &s;ays he, &s;hould it be po&s;&s;ible for you to be guilty? I! O heavens, what I! It is the other, it is the Italian I have with me. How did you know it? Sir, in pity, don't run me down &s;o much; I am vexed enough&mdash;I am innocent, I declare upon my honor.</P>
<P>The old man, moved with horror and compa&s;&s;ion; knew no longer Alexis, the &s;tamp of candor and prob|ity is imprinted on the youth's countenance. The &s;tranger &s;tares at him, tells the five and twenty louis d'ors, which he holds out with a wavering hand, and prepares to a&s;k him for the accomplice that has the remainder of the &s;um, when Sciocco, without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion enters the room, with an air of gaiety and &s;at|isfaction. Come hither, thou wretch, cried Alexis with a low voice, enter, &s;hut the door, and own the vile&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t of all crimes! What crime? What crime, villain, replied the old man, &s;haking him by the collar! tell me this moment the name of thy accom|plice, or thou art lo&s;t! <HI>Perdio lei Signori,</HI> I don't know what you mean; Ah! thou playe&s;t the ignorant, in|famous thief! Thief! I am no thief! He dares &s;till to deny the fact! and tho&s;e twenty-five louis d'ors? They are mine. Thine? To be &s;ure; John gave them to me. Well, John has committed the theft! But pray, what are you talking of theft? I tell you, John got a prize in the lottery, and gave me that &s;um. Very well, re&s;umed the old man, &s;o he got it in the lottery? we &s;hall &s;ee that.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="030364_0196_0FE5D332EEE05208">
The old man leaves the room; in vain do Alexis and Sciocco u&s;e their utmo&s;t efforts to retain him; he is gone. Being thus le&s;t by them&s;elves, Alexis, over|whelmed with grief, loads the innocent Italian with re|proaches, the latter falls down on his knees, and &s;wears by all the &s;aints in Paradi&s;e that he is innocent. They were both in that cruel agitation, when a great tumult aro&s;e before the gate of the inn, and completed their ter|rors. People call out <HI>&s;top thief! &s;top thief!</HI> &s;oon the mob gathers&mdash;the thief is taken, brought to the inn, and known for having committed frequent depredations, not without violent &s;u&s;picion of being guilty of the pre&s;ent.

I did not wi&s;h my uncle to remind me of my prom|i&s;e, to fulfil it. In con&s;equence I went to the receiver, who told me down the &s;um, and thinking on you my good gentlemen, I took Mr. Sciocco in private, to of|fer him the part I had de&s;tined for him. At fir&s;t he &s;tarted a world of objections, remarking, how his friend's delicacy might be hurt by &s;uch a proceeding. But, what occa&s;ion have you, &s;aid I, to tell him &s;o &s;oon, but keep that &s;um in &s;tore, again&s;t &s;ome unfore|&s;een accident; he liked my notion, and has favored me in accepting the offer. This, gentlemen, is &s;trictly true; yet, I cannot help owning, that this explanation co&s;ts me much, and that I &s;hall always have at heart the affront put upon me at this day!&mdash;Oh, did my poor uncle know it&mdash;It would break his heart.</P>
<P>Thus &s;poke the hone&s;t the virtuous Picot, and the Italian, who, on the other hand, was not le&s;s affected, could not conceive how his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mae&s;tro</HI> could think him guilty of &s;o ba&s;e an infame&mdash;He chid him with gentlene&s;s; yet with delicacy of &s;entiment. Alexis, aba&s;hed at his extravagance, dared neither to &s;peak, nor even to look at him.</P>
<P>The old man could hardly put an end to his excu&s;|es, and offered his pur&s;e, by way of reparation to tho&s;e he had in&s;ulted. John Picot above all, who &s;hed a torrent of bitter tears, had moved the &s;ieur to &s;uch a degree, that he addre&s;&s;ed him in the following words, with an air of real contrition: Lovely young man, you that deny forgivene&s;s, give me but time to manife&s;t my repentance? Come with me, be my friend, my confident, and leave me the care to make your fortune&mdash;An&s;wer me, John, will you &s;erve me?&mdash;Will you be a &s;econd to my&s;elf?

<P>Alexis, Sciocco and John made no an&s;wer. At la&s;t, the &s;tranger, who&s;e phy&s;iognomy was meek and re&s;|pectable, begged with &s;uch energy and effect, that they could no longer with&s;tand his generous intentions.</P>

<P>OUR four friends, after having &s;worn the mo&s;t in|violable union, re&s;olved to &s;et out for Paris the very next morning. John, whom the genero&s;ity of the old man had again moved to tears, went imme|diately to take leave of his uncle Joachin. The &s;tran|ger returned to his room, to pack up his portman|teaus, and Alexis being left alone with Sciocco, was much at a lo&s;s what to think of him. Luckily, and through the old man's di&s;cretion, the affair of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> louis d'ors had not come to the knowledge of any per&s;on belonging to the inn; but Alexis had never|thele&s;s &s;u&s;pected his tru&s;ty Sciocco! he had even ac|cu&s;ed him! All appearances were certainly again&s;t the Italian; the timid and mi&s;tru&s;ting Alexis, knew not how to act in &s;o delicate a juncture; and had it been the fate of Sciocco to be actually guilty, his con|duct towards an humane and generous &s;tranger, was, in all re&s;pects calculated to extricate him from dan|ger. But it happened to turn out otherwi&s;e; Scioc|co was innocent; Alexis had been too ha&s;ty, too mi&s;tru&s;ting; of this he was &s;en&s;ible, He blu&s;hed, and dared hardly to lift his eyes towards the injured Car|lo&mdash;How little did he know him! He was the fir&s;t who cla&s;ped his <HI>Caro Mae&s;tro</HI> in his arms, intreating him to di&s;card the remembrance of a &s;light error, which he could not prevent, as it mu&s;t have happened.

It wanted no le&s;s than this le&s;&s;on of a good heart, to make Alexis &s;till more &s;en&s;ible of his wrong. The more Sciocco attributed it to prede&s;tination, the more the other laid to his own charge all that had happened to him; the effect of the contradiction of human principles: one defect is always corrected by another of an oppo&s;ite nature: mi&s;tru&s;t and timidity vani&s;h, if &s;uper&s;eded by a noble confidence, the &s;oul of all good undertakings.</P>
<P>But let us lo&s;e no time in reflections. Alexis has blu&s;hed&mdash;He has &s;worn within him&s;elf to be more pru|dent and le&s;s inclined to &s;u&s;picion in future. Let us now be&s;tow our attention on the &s;eries of his adven|tures.</P>
<P>Next morning they all met in the old man's apart|ment. The inn-keeper's bills are di&s;charged, our four travellers &s;tep into a po&s;t chai&s;e, and depart.</P>
<P>The po&s;t-boy, who drove with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, &s;ets them down at the beginning of the night at the fir&s;t and be&s;t inn of <HI>Rouanne &s;ur L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire;</HI> not that they wanted to &s;top all night, but only to refre&s;h them&s;elves and to change hor&s;es. Alexis alighted with John for the purpo&s;e of walking in the evening air. A bu&s;tle before the gate of the inn attracts their notice; they approach and look&mdash;It was the ho&s;tlers and &s;ervants of the inn, ordering away, with the greate&s;t inhumani|ty, a poor traveller, who reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;t him&s;elf in the &s;tables for that night. No, cried the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cy valets, no! we would not harbor &s;uch beggars as you, indeed, we have been tricked too often.</P>
<P>Alexis, from an impul&s;e of humanity, addre&s;&s;es them, "why will you thus refu&s;e a&mdash;"</P>
<P>He had not time to go farther; the beggar &s;tars at him, he knows him, and throws him&s;elf in his arms; it is he, it is he&mdash;My Alexis; John looks; hey! is it you, father Hilary?&mdash;No, no, it is not he.

<P>Dumont and Alexis are locked in each others arms: Alexis, who remembers the treachery of his tutor, &s;ees but a friend in this moment.</P>

The old man and Sciocco have left the po&s;t chai&s;e; John &s;hews them the affecting &s;cene. Soon after they all five enter an apartment of the inn, order an excel|lent &s;upper, and enjoy the bli&s;s of the re-union.</P>
<P>Dumont and his pupil, are &s;timulated with a reci|procal eagerne&s;s to know each other's adventures, which they are equally de&s;irous to hear.</P>

<P>While you laid &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor, and I was giv|ing you all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which friend&s;hip and human|ity can afford, your father &s;aid to me, in a &s;avage tone of voice, You blame me, Mr. Dumont?&mdash;Come down for a moment, come down, and you &s;hall find in my carriage, a per&s;on who will give you an account of the misfortunes this unhappy boy has brought upon me.

<P>Here he turned to the landlord: &s;ir, &s;aid he, do not leave him. Come, then, Mr. Dumont! it is but a &s;tep or two. I was he&s;itating whether I &s;hould fol|low him, or &s;tay with you. At la&s;t, (who would have &s;u&s;pected his cruelty?) I followed him down &s;tairs, trembling, well per&s;uaded that I &s;hould return with him, or alone: we advanced to a po&s;t chai&s;e, which was waiting within a gun&s;hot from the inn. In it &s;at a woman in years, and rather of a fine&s;ter appearance. Step in, &s;ir, &s;tep in, &s;aid &s;he, it is only for a moment. I mu&s;t tell you&mdash;</P>

She added many things: I would not hear her; un|ea&s;y about you, and about what they could want of me, I was ready to return to the inn; but time was not left to me; your father &s;teps in, lays hold of my hand; three tall fellows in livery pu&s;h me in the chai&s;e, &s;hut the door, and the po&s;t-boy rai&s;es clouds of du&s;t, &s;o hard did he drive.</P>
<P>I &s;olemnly declare, that hurried away with &s;uch vio|lence, I had no &s;trength to call for help; my fir&s;t feel|ings were horror and indignation. I looked at your father, and &s;aid to him, with a bitter &s;mile, Barbarous man! Is this the odious de&s;ign you had upon me? You tear me from the unfortunate Alexis! Ah! he cannot &s;urvive it!&mdash;Compo&s;e your&s;elf, Mr. Dumont, Ah! did you know!&mdash;All your ferocity, unnatural father! I would, indeed, never have thought it!&mdash;Sir!&mdash;Oh! permit me to indulge my grief!&mdash;What do you want of me? What means that violence which you exerci&s;ed upon me? have you any rights over me?&mdash;Ah, is it not enough to let loo&s;e your rage a|gain&s;t your &s;on?&mdash;His &s;on! &s;aid the lady, he is not his &s;on.

Had the gentleman followed my advice, he would have taken him along with us; I would have brought him up, I would.</P>
<P>I glanced my eye with furious indignation upon the lady, and turning round to your father, conjuring him with tears in my eyes, to let me go back to you; I repre&s;ented your &s;ituation, your grief, and &s;ucceeded in moving him a little.

<P>Your father, my dear pupil, &s;aid things which a&s;|toni&s;hed me &s;till more. The half confidence he made me, &s;o captivated my eager curio&s;ity, that I could nei|ther perceive a po&s;t-chai&s;e, flying with the rapidity of a dart, nor even the approach of night&mdash;We had ju&s;t left a little village, when an unknown voice called out to the people behind the carriage: Hey, is it you, Champaign? Yes, an&s;wered the valet. It is they, an|&s;wered the voice to the cavaliers. This in&s;tant, they alight from their hor&s;es, lay hold of the doors of the chai&s;e, open them, and one of them &s;aid very bluntly to your father, Hey, marquis, have you got that dar|ling child? you mu&s;t either deliver him to us, or die in&s;tantly, you&mdash;Ah! my brother, cried the lady, &s;top!

<P>Your father, I, and his people, leave the carriage. We began with the &s;trangers, who were four or five in number, a bloody combat en&s;ued, of which I could not &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue, my &s;kull being wounded with a &s;word, in con&s;equence of which I fell down weltering in my blood.</P>
<P>To all appearance, I laid for a long time &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground; when I recovered my rea&s;on, it was

in the dead of night. I &s;aw neither your father, nor the lady, nor any of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins near me, except &s;even or eight &s;habby fellows who carried me on a litter. They informed me on the road, that I was then half a league from Lyons; that the archbi&s;hop of that place, who pa&s;&s;ing by in his carriage, had heard my moans, one of his &s;ervants had been di&s;patched, and informed him that tho&s;e groans were uttered by a wounded per&s;on, who could only be removed upon a litter. The arch bi&s;hop had no &s;ooner reached Lyons, than he &s;ent people to bring me to the infirmary of the archbi&s;hoprick. I was actually carried there, and the archbi&s;hop came him&s;elf to know who had put me in &s;uch a condition on the road. I thanked him for his humanity, and gave him &s;ome eva&s;ive an&s;wers, to conceal the real cau&s;e of my wound.</P>
<P>Is not the &s;udden intru&s;ion of the&s;e &s;trangers, and their combat with your father, a problem to you?&mdash;Well my dear Alexis, it was and &s;till is one to me. To all appearance they were your enemies; they were in pur&s;uit of you, becau&s;e they thought to find you in the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and one of them was the brother of the lady who accompanied us. But when I reflect upon your father's my&s;terious di&s;cour&s;e, and upon the &s;nare laid for us in the inn at Valence, from which he delivered me, I could no help concluding them to be the very wretches whom alone we had rea&s;on to fear. Be&s;ides, he that wounded me was no &s;tranger to my per&s;on; for as much as I am able to recollect, he &s;aid in giving me the blow, <HI>prithee where's thy pupil?</HI> I fell, and they left me, becau&s;e they thought I was dead.

<P>I was taken care of at the infirmary of Lyons; the metropolitan, from time to time came to vi&s;it me, and to &s;ee me properly tended and treated.</P>
<P>Having got well, I went out to take the air in the environs of Lyons, the &s;ituation of which is truly de|lightful.

I di&s;covered in one of my rural excur&s;ions a little chappel; who&s;e ancient and ruinous appearance &s;truck me much.&mdash;Being informed by a pea&s;ant, of its having once been the retreat of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hermit, I took it into my head to make it my re&s;idence.&mdash;I had lo&s;t all hope of ever &s;eeing you again, becau&s;e one of the people who waited on me, during my ailment, and a relation to the inn keeper at Valence, at who&s;e hou&s;e I had left you, having wrote to him with regard to you, and was an&s;wered, that &s;ame day that you had left the inn, and he did not know what was become of you.</P>

<P>Dumont, having thus fini&s;hed his narrative, he re|que&s;ted Alexis to give him al&s;o an account to his ad|ventures, who in compliance of his ju&s;t demand, be|gan with his re&s;idence in the cottage, his pa&s;&s;ion for Clara, the hi&s;tory of Dorance, the perfidy of Duverly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> concluding with the di&s;agreeable accidents, in which his indi&s;cretion and imprudent conduct had in|volved him: above all, his mi&s;tru&s;t and &s;u&s;pecting temper.</P>

<P>The old man, being in his turn reque&s;ted to give the details of the misfortunes of his life, excu&s;ed him&s;elf under pretence that they could give concern to none but him&s;elf; and that, after adventures as a&s;toni&s;hing as tho&s;e that had been recounted, nothing remained to &s;aid, but what would be too unintere&s;ting; yet he would relate them one day; but as for the pre&s;ent, he begged his friends, above all things, to be&s;tow their attention upon a project which he had ju&s;t conceived,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHO THE OLD MAN IS&mdash;THE RETURN TO THE COT|TAGE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOUR adventures, my dear Alexis, have given me no &s;mall concern. They reminded me of many per&s;ons of my acquaintance&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;A moment if you plea&s;e: do hear me without interrup|tion?</P>
<P>Greenoble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> has been long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">my re&s;idence: that Dorance, Duverly, Adela, Clara, Germain, I know them all. I hear Dorance is &s;till alive, which gives me great joy. As to Duverly, whom you have men|tioned in your narrative&mdash;he is no more, that treacher|ous friend.&mdash;Are you &s;ure?&mdash;Yes, very &s;ure.&mdash;Alas! &s;o Clara's father is dead!&mdash;Her mother has preceeded him, I have been told, long ago. The unfortunate Adela has been the victim of the crimes of her &s;educer, and a hu&s;band's jealou&s;y!&mdash;Forgive tho&s;e tears&mdash;&s;ad remembrance!&mdash;Alas! how lovely has &s;he been!</P>
<P>It is therefore u&s;ele&s;s, my dear Alexis, to go any more in pur&s;uit of the traitor who&s;e head you are char|ged to bring. Heaven! have you met with me who could give you this intelligence, and inform you that you have fulfilled your commi&s;&s;ion; but as Dorance might not altogether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ake your word, I will my&s;elf accompany you to the cottage, he knows me, and will be glad to hear, from my own mouth, every thing that may &s;atisfy his mind. You &s;hall &s;ee again your Cla|ra, whom you love &s;o dearly; and I &s;hall &s;ee her too, that lovely child, whom I have known from the ear|lie&s;t period of her infancy.&mdash;In &s;hort, I can a&s;&s;ure you, every body &s;hall be &s;atisfied.&mdash;What, &s;ir, will you
<PB N="204" REF="030364_0207_0FE5D373E723CA68">
have me return to a man, who dared to command a murder! My good youth, your humanity, your vir|tues, in a word, all in you be&s;peak my &s;avor. Yet give me leave to excu&s;e Dorance: he has been made a wretch for life, &s;o it mu&s;t be natural in him to &s;eek revenge; be as it will, you have not perpet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ated the bloody act! Certainly not. I grant that Dorance is blood thir&s;ty, but you have &s;pilt no blood, and fate has di&s;po&s;ed events &s;o, that without &s;ullying your&s;elf with a crime, you &s;hall be entitled to Clara's hand.&mdash;Heaven! by the fatal tidings of her father's death!&mdash;Leave this to me, I will &s;atisfy Dorance on that head, I will engage him to unite you with Adela's daughter.&mdash;Generous &s;tranger, how happy am I to have met with you!&mdash;but may I not know the name of &s;o re&s;|pectable a per&s;on?&mdash;I go by the name of Preville.&mdash;Is that your rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> name?&mdash;I have &s;till many others; but that I like be&s;t.&mdash;Well, M. de Preville, I &s;hall follow your advice; I &s;hall go to the cottage; but will Dumont, Sciocco, and John, follow us?</P>
<P>The&s;e three friends &s;wore to accompany Alexis where&s;oever he &s;hould go;&mdash;their departure for the cottage was of cour&s;e fixed for the next morning.</P>
<P>Alexis ea&s;ily perceived in the old man an air of con|&s;traint which a&s;toni&s;hed him; but this he attributed to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> kind of regret, which the &s;tory he had related, and compri&s;ing &s;o many of his friends, had excited in his brea&s;t. At any other time Alexis might perhaps have taken umbrage at M. Preville's confu&s;ion; but his own temper, which had always been &s;o productive of di&s;agreeable incidents, had made him &s;wear to ban|i&s;h mi&s;tru&s;t from his heart, and for this he would give no encouragement in his mind to &s;imilar ideas.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, our hero was happy: he had &s;ound again his faithful Dumont; he had found him as true to his attachment as he had been formerly. Moreover, the good natured Sciocco whom he loved, was al&s;o in his company, and two hone&s;t &s;trangers, one of whom had extricated him from a very critical &s;ituation, by an|nouncing the death of Duverly, and promi&s;ing to car|ry, him&s;elf, the&s;e tidings to Dorance&mdash;Thus, he re|turned to the cottage, in hopes of &s;eeing his dear Cla|ra, for he was ignorant of her departure.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="030364_0208_0FE5D3BEEE2EB930">
Alexis was re&s;tle&s;s all night long. He ro&s;e the fir&s;t in the morning, and ran to the po&s;t-office to order a chai&s;e. At his return, he found all his friends rea|dy and joyful, except M. de Preville, who had pa&s;t a wor&s;e night than him&s;elf. The chai&s;e arrives, our friends &s;tep in it, and po&s;t away.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not tre&s;pa&s;s upon the reader's time, with ex|patiating upon the plea&s;ure which our travellers felt in &s;o plea&s;ing a journey, as he will gue&s;s the whole, from the tempers and characters of our re&s;pective he|roes. For in&s;tance, <HI>prede&s;tination,</HI> and <HI>the order of things</HI> were brought upon the carpet by Sciocco, and refuted by Mr. Dumont, whom the folly of the Italian a&s;|toni&s;hed to the highe&s;t degree. Love, its plea&s;ures and pangs, were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by Alexis and the old man; and the latter dwelt upon the &s;ubject with more &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s and &s;orrow than his young friend. Hone&s;t John read again and again his uncle Joachin's letter, and related the hi&s;tory of different &s;trangers whom he had &s;erved during his late prime waiter&s;hip at the Dol|phin.</P>
<P>In a word, &s;ome were talking, others meditating, and every one was occupied one way or other. Hav|ing rode po&s;t all night, they arrived at St. Marcellin, where Sciocco and Alexis, did not care much to make their appearance, le&s;t they &s;hould be recognized by the gaoler, who&s;e wife had delivered them from their place of confinement. They were informed that the latter had returned to her husband, and were much a|mazed at the man's good nature, who conde&s;cended with &s;uch grace to receive his &s;pou&s;e whenever &s;he thought it expedient or agreeable to favor him with her per&s;on.</P>
<P>From Marcellin, (our &s;trangers having previou&s;ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the po&s;t-chai&s;e,) preceeded gently on the road which leads to the fore&s;t of Chamboran. All five armed with pi&s;tols, cutla&s;&s;es, and &s;tout cudgels, they feared no attack from the banditti who infe&s;ted tho&s;e woody domains.</P>
<P>Having thus walked to a di&s;tance of two leagues and upwards, upon paths well known to our Alexis, they de&s;cried a winding path, the draw-bridge, and the top of the cottage. They were exactly on the ve|ry
<PB N="206" REF="030364_0209_0FE5D3760A6777A8">
&s;ame &s;pot, where Clara had once &s;aid to Alexis <HI>There, do you &s;ee the cottage!</HI> The heart of Dumont's pupil was now in a &s;trong emotion, he felt an incon|ceivable <HI>Je ne &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i quoi;</HI> yet it was not quite di&s;plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>M. de Preville's condition was far from being like that of Alexis; No &s;ooner did he perceive the cottage, and above all the great poplar that ro&s;e its lofty top to the clouds, than he turned pale, and a cold &s;weat quite chilled his frame&mdash;he dropped down &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the mo&s;&s;y ground.&mdash;Alexis endeavored to make him reco|ver from his &s;woon; it was in vain, all his efforts joined to tho&s;e of his friends proved u&s;ele&s;s. Finally, they re&s;olved to carry him&mdash;to carry him&mdash;poor Alexis!&mdash;did&s;t thou but know what thou art doing.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the confu&s;ion and &s;woon of M. de Preville &s;truck his four friends with a mo&s;t &s;ingular &s;urprize. However deeply he might have been affected by Dorance, by Clara, even by the tragical exit of Adela, whom he owned to have known once, yet it &s;eemed incredible that all this &s;hould cau&s;e &s;o violent a revolution in him&mdash;&s;hould he have had a &s;hare in the adventures of Dorance?&mdash;It was he!&mdash;Let us bani&s;h &s;uperficial doubts, which we cannot clear up&mdash;let us enter the cottage, and not lo&s;e &s;ight of our travellers. Thus they carried the unfortunate Preville to the draw|bridge, which was drawn up. Nobody appeared, yet it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to get admittance, which was certainly difficult, there being neither bell nor porter to &s;avor their de&s;ign. Long would they have waited, but for a circum&s;tance which turned out propiteous.</P>
<P>Candor, &s;ince the flight of his dear Clara, which had affected him to an extreme, &s;uffered not a &s;ingle day to elap&s;e, without mounting the wall of the fo&s;&s;e, to &s;ee whether he could de&s;cry her coming from afar. Always in hopes of &s;eeing again the lovely child, whom he cheri&s;hed as his own, he &s;pent whole days upon a kind of terrace, &s;hedding tears, and imploring provi|dence to re&s;tore his dear Clara.</P>
<P>"Great God!" &s;aid he, ince&s;&s;antly, "thou who knowe&s;t my heart, thou who knowe&s;t how dear I held that offspring of crime, thee I call to witne&s;s the &s;ince|rity of my feelings!&mdash;I had, indeed, no other intention

O my God, thou do&s;t puni&s;h me!&mdash;well have I de&s;erved the frowns of thy ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>The&s;e were the affecting ejaculations which Candor &s;ent to heaven, when a noi&s;e at his feet ju&s;t facing the draw-bridge, made him ca&s;t his eyes downwards&mdash;What does he perceive?&mdash;Alexis!&mdash;Alexis!&mdash;can it be he?&mdash;Yes, it is the good natured Alexis, it is he&mdash;attended by four &s;trangers. Candor examines eagerly each face; he &s;eeks his daughter&mdash;&s;he is not among them!&mdash;O grief!</P>
<P>But who is that &s;tranger, pale, feeble, &s;upported by his young friend? Candor believes he knows his fea|tures! he tries to recollect&mdash;&s;hould it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Duverly?&mdash;Duverly! &s;hould there be &s;ome collu&s;ion between Alexis and him! do they both come to in&s;ult him!&mdash;three &s;trangers follow them! What means this cabal.</P>
<P>Candor he&s;itates for a moment whether or not he ought to open the cottage to this band&mdash;he is alone with an old &s;ervant as weak as he. But why &s;hould he remain in &s;u&s;pence? If he mu&s;t peri&s;h, his life &s;hall be &s;old dear to his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins! It is Duverly! yes Candor knows him! What a fury blazes in his heart!</P>
<P>While he was thus engaged in thought, Alexis, who perceived him, cried in a tone of &s;weetne&s;s and &s;ym|pathy: <HI>Father, let down the drawbridge&mdash;We are all your friends!</HI>&mdash;You all my friends?</P>
<P>Candor calls Germain; they both let down the draw-bridge.&mdash;Alexis, Sciocco, Dumont, John Picot, and M. de Preville enter. M. de Preville, who had re|covered

his &s;trength, cannot withhold his tears at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of the unhappy Dorance, grown hoary under the weight of years and misfortune.</P>
<P>Alexis looks around for his Clara; he does not &s;ee her, he turns pale, he is going to enquire for her of Do|rance, but the latter &s;aves him that trouble. What do you &s;eek here, young man!&mdash;Have you avenged me?&mdash;Where is my enemy's head!&mdash;Upbraid me not, I pray, my father, this re&s;pectable old gentleman, who conde&s;cended to accompany me, will &s;atisfy your curi|o&s;ity.</P>
<P>Dorance, who &s;ees his doubts realized, &s;tares boldly at M. de Preville, who&s;e tongue denies its office; Alexis occupied in looking for his Clara, goes all round the place. Dumont, Sciocco, and John wait with terror the i&s;&s;ue of an event which they begin to comprehend better: all four actors impelled by different &s;entiments, repre&s;ent a &s;trong characteri&s;tic picture, and for &s;ome minutes, the profounde&s;t &s;ilence reigns among them.</P>
<P>De Preville breaks it fir&s;t. Well, Dorance, what do you fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at my &s;ight!&mdash;Rage, fury, de&s;pair!&mdash;Do you know me again? The exce&s;s of my hatred calls thee, perfidious Duverly.</P>

My fate is in thy hands, take away my life and I will not murmur. I have deceived, abu&s;ed, and ba&s;ely betrayed thee&mdash;under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, I have given thee mo&s;t cruel blows to thy generous and confiding heart&mdash;I have cau&s;ed the death of a woman equally dear to us both&mdash;I &s;till offend thee, I &s;ee, by my di&s;cour&s;e; why do&s;t thou tarry? here is my brea&s;t, pierce it, it waits the mortal blow from thy hand; it waits&mdash;without a moan.</P>
<P>Alexis throws him&s;elf down before Duverly, whom Dorance &s;urveyed with the highe&s;t indignation.&mdash;Cowardly foe, &s;aid he to Preville; how dare&s;t thou to brave and in&s;ult me?&mdash;To in&s;ult thee, what I?&mdash;O

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE POINT OF RE-UNION IN THE COTTAGE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SEVERAL days had elap&s;ed &s;ince the departure of M. Du Monay, the receiver. The marquis and marchione&s;s had every regard for Clara, whom they &s;till believed to be the receiver's niece, and cheri&s;hed her from this con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The marquis, marchione&s;s and Clara, took one day an airing in the delightful gardens of Luxembourgh, a place of fa&s;hionable re&s;ort. Having made &s;everal turns, they, in imitation of other &s;trangers, &s;at down upon a chair, to re&s;t them&s;elves from the fatigues of their walk.</P>
<P>A per&s;on, who appeared to be an abbe, was &s;itting by Clara, and had gazed at her for a long time, &s;o as to put her to the blu&s;h, and could not help expre&s;&s;ing his curio&s;ity in the&s;e words: Mi&s;s, I beg you a thou|&s;and pardons for my indi&s;cretion; pray, had not I the honor of &s;eeing you &s;omewhere? Clara looks in his face, and &s;eems to know him&mdash;&s;he blu&s;hes. The abbe perceived it. I &s;ee you recollect me, &s;aid he.&mdash;Pray was it not at Lyons? no,&mdash;you are however much like a certain Alexis&mdash;Alexis! cried the mar|quis and marchione&s;s both at once.&mdash;Alexis! cried a
<PB N="212" REF="030364_0215_0FE5D3A9903834D8">
woman in her turn, who was &s;itting a little farther!&mdash;Yes, replied the abbe, you are that Alexis whom I &s;aw at the barone&s;s d'Yrace! Father Stephen, whi&s;pered the trembling Clara, pray have done. What do you wi&s;h to &s;ay of Alexis? a&s;ked the woman.&mdash;I have &s;een a young man of that name at Mar&s;eilles.&mdash;At Mar|&s;eilles, madam? &s;aid the intimidated Clara. Have you known Alexis at Mar&s;eilles? Alas, mi&s;s, don't revive that deare&s;t remembrance. Deare&s;t, you &s;ay, madam? Should you be the young lady from M. Du Monay's? Who told you my tyrant's name? Yes, I am the unfortunate Sophia, who loved &s;o much the young Alexis! Let us not be under a mi&s;take, ladies, &s;aid the ex-capuchin. I &s;peak of the lovely Clara here before us; and you, madam, of that Alexis, who runs all over the world to &s;eek a father whom he has never known? A father he has never known! replied the marquis with great emotion. Ah! what do you tell me? what name have you uttered?&mdash;Softly my dear, &s;aid the marchione&s;s, methinks our Clara has more knowledge of the whole affair: we &s;hall beg of her for information:&mdash;Knowledge of Alexis, madam, I have indeed!&mdash;Good God! my hu&s;band and I are much concerned for him; pray explain your&s;elf.&mdash;Madam, neither the time nor place are &s;uitable. I beg it as a favor, let us return to the hotel, and there I will give you a mo&s;t faithful account of what you may wi&s;h to know, though I have the &s;tricte&s;t injunc|tions to the contrary from my uncle: forgive that ex|pre&s;&s;ion; I mean to &s;ay from my worthy benefactor.</P>
<P>Clara and the noble pair ri&s;e from their &s;eats: Cla|ra di&s;covering her rival in Sophia, ca&s;ts a glance of indignation upon her, which the latter endeavors to interpret. By this time, father Stephen &s;eeing he mu&s;t loo&s;e his prey, attempts to whi&s;per to Clara, and &s;he will not hear him; the ex capuchin, awed by the pre|&s;ence of the marquis and his &s;pou&s;e, proceeds no far|ther; he retires quite de&s;perately, and our three friends return to the hotel, where the marchione&s;s, who had violently re&s;trained her feelings, let fall a torrent of tears. You will not be &s;urpri&s;ed, my lovely Clara, &s;aid &s;he &s;obbing, at the impre&s;&s;ion which the adventure
<PB N="213" REF="030364_0216_0FE5D3C5D3E67B80">
of the gardens make upon me, when you &s;hall come to know. From the de&s;cription given of his per&s;on, it can be no other than your &s;on, my dear lord! Your &s;on! cried Clara with an exaltation of voice, your &s;on! What, my lord, &s;hould Alexis be your &s;on? Yes, an&s;wered the marquis, fetching a deep &s;igh, and here is his mother! Oh Alexis, Alexis! where art thou?&mdash;Come fly to their arms! Clara you augment our angui&s;h; &s;peak, &s;peak, have pity on a father's pain.</P>
<P>Clara, in a tran&s;port of joy, is unable to collect her ideas; &s;he lifts her eyes up to heaven, and utters vague exclamations; &s;oon after, &s;he makes an apolo|gy for having, on account of Du Monay's in&s;truction, concealed her hi&s;tory from her benefactors. They all &s;it down, and Clara relates her own hi&s;tory, and that of Alexis, his re&s;idence and flight from the cottage; and concludes with owning that &s;he knew not what had become of her lover. He was at Mar&s;eilles, ad|ded &s;he; there he turned faithle&s;s! there he got ac|quainted with that Sophia whom we have ju&s;t left; but as he has not accompanied her, I know not where he can be&punc; Oh my God! why does thy power not read him to this hou&s;e?&mdash;Alas! how happy would he be!&mdash;and we how happy.</P>
<P>Arzelia and her lord could hardly re&s;pire during the long narrative of Clara; the marquis e&s;pecially, who remembered his cruelties, his wrongs to &s;o amia|ble a &s;on, and the vexations he had cau&s;ed him through the malice of his enemies, could not forgive him&s;elf. It is I, exclaimed he; I am that unnatural father, who involved him into the aby&s;s of wretchedne&s;s!&mdash;Where is he? innocent youth: What is his fate?&mdash;O God, thou art witne&s;s to the &s;earches and pur&s;uits I have made &s;ince the ble&s;&s;ed in&s;tant which re-united me with my &s;pou&s;e!&mdash;I &s;ent emi&s;&s;aries, and went my&s;elf to a thou&s;and places, to &s;eek a &s;on who co&s;ts me &s;o ma|ny tears! O Clara! if ever we find him, he &s;hall be thy con&s;ort!&mdash;Be both our children.&mdash;Ah! how wor|thy art thou of his heart and affections.</P>
<P>During the&s;e &s;entimental emanations, the marchion|e&s;s became very pen&s;ive. All on a &s;udden &s;he breaks in on her hu&s;band's di&s;cour&s;e. My friend&mdash;my dear
<PB N="214" REF="030364_0217_0FE5D3ABC2AC0948">
friend&mdash;an idea takes my fancy!&mdash;yes, hope influen|ces my mind, and fills my &s;oul with con&s;olation! per|haps he has returned to the cottage; we may find him there! Madam, he certainly knows not that I have left it; he might, but no, he has forgot me; there was no place I pa&s;&s;ed through in my journey, but gave me the &s;ad news of his broken faith. At St. Marcellin, ah! the perfidious Alexis; perhaps he con&s;oles him&s;elf in &s;ome other quarter of the world with &s;ome new conque&s;t. My daughter, believe a mother's heart! Your own was too intimately connec|ted with his! you were born for one another; he will return to the cottage, he will &s;urely return: Oh! &s;ul|lied with my father's blood! What a baneful &s;u&s;pi|cion! can a youth of &s;o &s;weet and timid a temper, &s;ul|ly him&s;elf with that attrocious murder? he is incapa|ble of doing it, to be ble&s;t with his father's feelings. So he is graced with your virtues, my deare&s;t Arze|lia, he mu&s;t &s;hrink at the very name of crime.</P>
<P>The marquis and marchione&s;s, after having te&s;tified a thou&s;and tender concerns for the fate of their &s;on, de|termined to &s;et out in&s;tantly for the cottage. If he is not there, &s;aid they, we will wait for him. To live in a place which our &s;on has inhabited will at lea&s;t be &s;ome con&s;olation for us. Clara knew not whether to accept or decline the journey&mdash;piqued at her lover's infidelity; eager to &s;ee again the hermitage, her Ger|main, and the beneficent Candor, of whom &s;he had no occa&s;ion to be afraid, while under the au&s;pices of the parents of Alexis; her mind was divided between a thou&s;and different thoughts; yet the &s;weet de&s;ire of again &s;eeing the cottage, and perhaps her lover too, overcame all her &s;cruples.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a day every thing was prepared for the intended journey. They &s;et off, arrive at St. Marcel|lin, alight from their carriage, commit it to the care of a valet, and take the plea&s;ant road of the fore&s;t of de Chamboran, under an e&s;cort of four vigorous dome&s;tics armed with pi&s;tols and cutla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>After a long walk of two hours and upwards, they de&s;cry before them the walls of the cottage; the draw|bridge being &s;till let down and the door open, cau&s;ed
<PB N="215" REF="030364_0218_0FE5D3951BD9A380">
Clara to be much &s;urpri&s;ed. Good God, cried &s;he, &s;hould Candor, be dead, or has the place been taken by a&s;&s;ault, and plundered? Already her mind was agitat|ed by a thou&s;and &s;u&s;picions, when &s;he perceived &s;ever|al tracts of the foot&s;teps of a man, which were directed towards the cottage. This revived Clara's hopes.&mdash;Alas! &s;aid &s;he, could we find him! oh! Alexis! &s;hould the&s;e be the traces of thy feet.</P>
<P>Clara looks around, &s;he examines all the&s;e marks&mdash;&s;he even believes to di&s;tingui&s;h them for being tho&s;e of her lover's foot: childi&s;h reflections, a ridiculous illu|&s;ion, begot by a fancy wholly taken up with its ob|ject!&mdash;Without doubt, this reflection mu&s;t appear ve|ry trifling to the readers; yet Clara could not be mi&s;taken:&mdash;let us then follow her.</P>
<P>The drawbridge, which was let down, favored the acce&s;s of our little troop to the cottage. They enter the premi&s;es&mdash;look around on all &s;ides, and perceive nobody. Clara takes the van:&mdash;how her poor heart beats&mdash;&s;he enters the apartments&mdash;not a &s;oul!&mdash;&s;he looks in the garden not a &s;oul!&mdash;Where is then Ger|main and Candor?&mdash;Ah! I hear them &s;peak, and very loud too&mdash;Heaven! the voice of Alexis! yes, it is his voice;&mdash;<HI>Clara is more your daughter than Duver|ly's! Have compa&s;&s;ion, my father!</HI> Did Alexis pro|nounce the&s;e words? Oh! I'm certain it is his voice, cried Clara, quite moved! His voice! replied the marquis and his &s;pou&s;e; what, our &s;on's voice?</P>
<P>Now all three unable to gue&s;s whence the &s;ounds proceeded, li&s;ten, without moving, and in the attitude of three &s;tatues.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Clara cries, it is from the temple! Oh, come, come!&mdash;we &s;hall find them there.</P>
<P>The door was actually open. Clara, the marquis, and Arzelia, de&s;cended with precipation down the little &s;tairs&mdash;&s;uddenly the faint glimmer of the lamp replaces day-light; and leave them only a very imper|fect view of objects;&mdash;Alexis turns his head: Clara, cries he!&mdash;Alexis! there is your father!</P>
<P><HI>Here,</HI> I feel my inability of de&s;cribing with proper energy, the &s;udden &s;en&s;ations of each of our re&s;pective heroes. My pen is not &s;ufficient to expre&s;s their &s;ur|pri&s;e

and tran&s;ports. Can what happens in an in&s;tant, admit of a long and tedious narration? My readers will form, them&s;elves, an idea of this picture, if they plea&s;e to remember, that Candor finds again his dear Clara; Duverly, his daughter; the latter, her father, her benefactor, and her lover; Alexis, a father, whom he had &s;o long panted for; the noble couple, a &s;on who had co&s;t them &s;o many tears; in &s;hort, Germain, Dumont, &amp;c. met again with dear friends of whom they had been &s;o long deprived.</P>
<P>What effu&s;ions of heart!&mdash;what que&s;tions!&mdash;Are you here?&mdash;Is it you?&mdash;You, my father!&mdash;My dear &s;on, &amp;c. They were all &s;peaking, and none did an|&s;wer.&mdash;All their faculties were &s;u&s;pended; their &s;ouls felt too much for expre&s;&s;ion; they were cla&s;ped in each others arms, in the &s;weete&s;t rapture.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Alexis, who was afraid le&s;t Dorance and Duverly &s;hould re&s;ume their former conver&s;ation, en|gaged every body to leave that di&s;mal place. They all gather and join in a body: Clara between the two enemies, Alexis between the marquis and marchion|e&s;s; Sciocco, lo&s;t in admiration; Dumont and John both moved to the &s;oul, clo&s;e the rear, and our heroes enter the garden, where they a&s;k each other for an account of their adventures. How happy am I, &s;aid Clara to Alexis, to have brought back your father!&mdash;And how unhappy am I to have re&s;tored you to your own! Do&s;t thou de&s;erve &s;till, faithle&s;s man, that I &s;hould &s;how the lea&s;t concern for thee!&mdash;Ah! do not rebuke me, Clara!&mdash;It was again&s;t my own wi&s;h I &s;erved the cruel Dorance!&mdash;Pray, what is become of the goaler's wife, and that Sophia of Mar&s;eilles? I do not comprehend you! I know all, ungrateful A|lexis, I know all&mdash;and am &s;orry to have ever loved you.</P>
<P>Alexis endeavors to unravel the meaning of this di&s;cour&s;e; but his father interrupts him: So I have found you my dear &s;on!&mdash;Can you &s;till love a father who has &s;o cruelly for&s;aken you in the inn at Val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce?

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE THUILLERIES AND PONT-TOURNANT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LOVE, intere&s;t and ambition are the three &s;courges which de&s;olated my life;&mdash;Love was my own crime; intere&s;t &s;wayed my barbarous brother; and ambition became the motive of all the vexations which a father heaped upon me:&mdash;why do I &s;ay a father!&mdash;he was not my father, and had no claim to that title!&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, I loved him, I re&s;pected him, and that timid re&s;pect has always hindered me from &s;haking off the heavy yoke, beneath which he would cru&s;h me. Alas! without his &s;on, without the cruel chevalier d'Anfort!&mdash;But I &s;ee the&s;e exclamations are a mere enigma to you my friends; I ought to explain it and relate the hi&s;tory of my family; thence I will make a digre&s;&s;ion upon my misfortunes&mdash;therefore attend to me.</P>
<P>Aurora Bleville, my mother, was the daughter of the celebrated count Bleville<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fictitious names of Bleville, Cor&s;ange, &amp;c. have been &s;ub&s;tituted out of re&s;pect for the families of my heroes, of which &s;everal di&s;tingui&s;hed families are now in being.</NOTE> amba&s;&s;ador at the court of Madrid in the preceding reign; &s;he could a&s;pire to the hand of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed young noblemen who then graced the gay circles of the court, as much by her beauty and virtues, as by the powerful credit which her father enjoyed: but young &s;till, &s;he &s;aw the count, and was no longer free to make a choice of her own. The count, on his &s;ide, fell de&s;perately in love with Aurora, and even carried his imprudence &s;o far as to demand her in marriage. The amba&s;&s;ador, of|fended at this proceeding, di&s;carded the young noble|man, put his daughter in a convent, and compelled her a few months after, to tie the marriage knot with the marquis de Cor&s;ange, the king's favorite, of an a|miable di&s;po&s;ition, and endowed with a thou&s;and bril|liant qualities; but for him Aurora felt an invincible repugnance; &s;he complied, however with a father's command, and gave proofs to her hu&s;band, if not of
<PB N="219" REF="030364_0222_0FE5D3967A49E000">
love, at lea&s;t of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip. I was the off|spring of this marriage, and my mother feeling for me all the attachment of maternal fondne&s;s, began to be accu&s;tomed to her pre&s;ent &s;tate of conjugal union, when &s;uddenly a cruel incident revived in her the &s;parks of her former pa&s;&s;ion, and its hopes. The king was at that time engaged in a war with Germany. The Am|ba&s;&s;ador and his &s;on in law, who &s;ought by one another's &s;ide, were both, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant, laid dead on the field by a cannon ball. My mother, who &s;aw her|&s;elf thus &s;uddenly rid of her father's and hu&s;band's yoke, thought only of contracting a &s;econd marriage: &s;he was then twenty-&s;ix, and count d'Anfort was thirty: both free, both equally in love, they &s;aw one another again, and joined in wedlock: but the imprudent Aurora, by this match, alienated from her the friend&s;hip of my father's whole family. Nobody would &s;ee or a&s;&s;i&s;t me, when afterwards I was compelled by misfortune to have recour&s;e to them.</P>
<P>Lady d'Anfort began to exact of her new hu&s;band that I &s;hould be brought up in his own eyes, and he neglected nothing to make me happy, and to render my education brilliant. The count promi&s;ed all, and faithfully kept his word for two years: I mean, till his &s;pou&s;e pre&s;ented him with a &s;on of his own. It is he, my friends, who is the cau&s;e of all my misfortunes.</P>
<P>The tenderne&s;s which the count and my mother felt for this &s;on, the fruits of love, rather than that of ma|trimony, &s;ingularly cooled them in their affections for me. A child as I was, I perceived and complained of it to my mother, who an&s;wered with &s;ullen &s;teadine&s;s: "Well, &s;ir, you &s;hall no longer be the object of that neglect; for to-morrow you are to be &s;ent to college, where you will &s;tay till you have completed your &s;tu|dies." I was thunder&s;truck at the&s;e words, and &s;pent the whole day in &s;hedding tears, and on the next morn|ing &s;et out, attended by one &s;ervant. When I went to embrace my mother, I remarked that &s;he turned her back upon me&mdash;My heart was depre&s;&s;ed, and I was upon the point of leaving the apartment, when my father-in-law, who &s;aw my angui&s;h, cla&s;ped me in his arms, and gently pre&s;&s;ed a little pre&s;ent in my hand,
<PB N="220" REF="030364_0223_0FE5D37FB7F541A0">
telling me with an air of affection, that if I was &s;tudi|ous, and would behave well, he would give me liberty to come to his hotel once a month. The&s;e words made me a little calmer: I &s;lept into the carriage, and re|paired with my valet to the college of Navarre&mdash;the &s;ame college where I &s;ince put my Alexis!</P>
<P>There I found a tutor waiting for me; a true pedant, quite made up of Latin and Greek, and who only added to my melancholy during all the time I had to &s;pend in that pri&s;on.</P>
<P>I was then twelve years of age, and I began to think my mother's coolne&s;s was a real torment to me. Whence could it proceed?&mdash;had I behaved ill to her? and &s;uppo&s;e this had been the ca&s;e, &s;hould &s;he not have made &s;ome allowance to a boy only twelve years old? Yet the count's care&s;&s;es had replaced her more than ever in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lial fondne&s;s. From that moment I loved her as much as &s;he had di&s;plea&s;ed me before. Sen&s;ible hearts have no &s;teadine&s;s in their opinions. A har&s;h expre&s;&s;ion will grieve and di&s;card them&mdash;the lea&s;t po|litene&s;s makes their affections return even farther than it has been before; it is as ea&s;y to make them happy, as to afflict them.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t year of my being at college, I had the &s;atisfaction to go from time to time to the hotel d'Anfort;&mdash;the &s;econd year, I was &s;ent for le&s;s fre|quently; the third le&s;s &s;till, and &s;oon I became quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t of que&s;tion. I lived in the college, forgot, as it were, by all nature, left to the care of mercenary peo|ple, with no other compen&s;ation than the company of a friend of the &s;ame age as my&s;elf, whom I had the good fortune to find there.</P>
<P>This friend! forgive me my giving a tear to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remembrance! this friend! alas! was mo&s;t dear to me, and I went &s;o far as; pardon, my friends, a thou&s;and pardons! it is the effect of ranklin re|mor&s;e, which rends my heart.</P>
<P>Dulys was his name; he profe&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;teady at|tachment to me: the &s;ame temper, the &s;ame affection, in a word, every thing united us; we were always together. On tho&s;e days which were fixed for the &s;tudents to walk out, we le&s;t the crowd to our fellow-&s;tudents to give
<PB N="221" REF="030364_0224_0FE5D35E130848B0">
&s;cope to our reflections. In &s;hort, the mo&s;t tender friend|&s;hip operated equally on our hearts. How he pitied my condition; how he could alleviate my &s;orrows! But as I &s;ee my dear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> my regrets, I will pa&s;s rap|idly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver this circum&s;tance of my hi&s;tory, which will &s;oon, in your eyes, overwhelm me with confu&s;ion and guilt.</P>
<P>Dulys was then fatherle&s;s; his mother, who loved him tenderly, lived at Dreux, and never came to Paris, but her &s;on regularly &s;pent the holidays with her&punc; Mrs. Dulys waited for that period with as much im|patience as I felt &s;orrow at its approach.&mdash;Alone in the college, bereft of my friends and parents, during two months of the year, I had no other medium than to &s;tudy or to &s;hed tears:&mdash;Youthful &s;tage of life, with what bitterne&s;s ha&s;t thou been annoyed!</P>
<P>I had now been &s;ix years at college, when I was one day informed that a &s;ervant de&s;ired to &s;peak to me. I go down, my heart palpitates for joy at the &s;ight of my &s;tep-father's livery. Sir, &s;aid the man, come quick with me! your mother is breathing her la&s;t. A thun|derbolt could not have &s;truck me as much as this news&punc;&mdash;Heaven, what accident has happened?&mdash;What ac|cident? It is no accident, my lord: your mother has been very bad the&s;e two months. What, the&s;e two months! Could you thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> leave me ignorant? She never a&s;ked for you till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> morning for the fir&s;t time: but pray, my lord, u&s;e di&s;patch, who knows but we mayn't find her alive&punc;</P>
<P>I felt &s;o many &s;en&s;ations of grief cau&s;ed by &s;udden &s;tarts of thought, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as on the point of fainting away. The &s;ervant perceives it, carries me to the coach, which was waiting before the gate of the col|lege, and which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rove with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch to the hotel d'Anfort.</P>
<P>I was conducted to an apartment, where my mother on her death-bed, was only waiting for that moment to re&s;ign her breath. My &s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aultering and weak tone of voice&mdash;I am ready to expire, you will lo&s;e me, my &s;on; I leave you a good father in the count <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have appointed him to be your guardi|an; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> conde&s;cend to take upon him for you the &s;uperintendance of the property of my fir&s;t hu&s;band,

the marquis de Cor&s;ange.&mdash;I give him full authority over you; obey him as you would me, and remember that you would do me an outrage in the tomb, which is ready to &s;wallow me, &s;hould you be wanting in gra|titude towards him!</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed my mother's hand, and bathed it in my tears; the count &s;tood weeping at the bed &s;ide, and his &s;on next him.&mdash;This is your brother, added my mother, pointing to the chevalier d'Anfort; I com|mand you both to live in clo&s;e intimacy, and to love one another till death &s;hall part you&mdash;do you promi&s;e me that?</P>
<P>I &s;tammered a few mono&s;yllables. Young d'An|fort an&s;wers, Yes; his voice being intercepted by &s;obs. His mother takes him in her arms attempts to embrace him, falls back on the pillow, and in&s;tantly expires! Notwith&s;tanding the awfulne&s;s and horror of that mo|ment, it grieved me to the heart that the la&s;t glance of my mother had been thrown on young d'Anfort. I envied him for it, and &s;howed him a hatred, which I could not &s;uppre&s;s afterwards: this without doubt was my only offence; I charge my&s;elf with it, but I could not conquer it.</P>
<P>Two days after my mother's death, the count, who &s;howed me many marks of friend&s;hip, embraced and promi&s;ed me an eternal attachment; begging me at the &s;ame time to return to the college; whither I went accordingly with a heart bleeding with &s;orrow. Dulys no &s;ooner &s;aw me than he flew to my arms. I related to him all that had happened, and we agreed unanimou&s;ly that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for me to be upon my guard again&s;t the fate which awaited me, as my only dependence was now on a man whom I was a &s;tranger to. Yet I felt &s;ome concern for that man; I re&s;pected him; I even went farther, I loved him, he had gained &s;uch an a&s;cendency over me, that I fear|ed and dared not to &s;peak before him. What follows will &s;how you how fatal that timidity has proved to me.</P>
<P>I remained two years longer at college; yet the count u&s;ed to &s;end for me once every fortnight.&mdash;Thus I &s;aw him, and the more his kindne&s;s attached
<PB N="223" REF="030364_0226_0FE5D3415EA4BA00">
me to him, the more I dete&s;ted the odious character of my brother. He was &s;carce fourteen, but his haugh|tine&s;s and impudence controuled all his actions. He &s;carcely deigned to look at me, called me always <HI>Sir,</HI> and rendered him&s;elf to be equally dete&s;table to all tho&s;e who came near him. All his faults had a cau&s;e; my mother, who made him her idol, indulged him in all his whims from his earlie&s;t infancy; he reigned with de&s;potic &s;way over all the dome&s;tics, and the ca|prices of a child were to be a &s;acred law to tho&s;e who were appointed to wait upon him. If chance ever made her mention my name to him, it was always to tell him, "My little d'Anfort, my darling child, I love thee more, yes, I cheri&s;h thee more than him, &amp;c." a hundred &s;imilar expre&s;&s;ions, of which I was informed, tended to fo&s;ter the boy's vanity, and to in&s;pire him with a &s;overeign contempt for me.&mdash;His father, on the other hand, in &s;pite of all the friend&s;hip he bore to me, made him the &s;ole object of his tenderne&s;s.&mdash;That good father even carried his love to weakne&s;s, nay &s;o far, that the little ma&s;ter often behaved to him with di&s;re&s;pect. At la&s;t the father's indulgence became as exce&s;&s;ive as the &s;on's arrogance. We often quarrelled: but I a|voided differences with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care, be|cau&s;e I &s;aw they became very vexatious to my dear preceptor! the more &s;o, as he always intere&s;ted his con&s;cience in the boy's favor. At la&s;t the chevalier's in&s;ult appeared to me rather contemptible than wor|thy of my notice. I did not fore&s;ee that my complai|&s;ance in yielding would co&s;t me &s;o much one day, and that my brother would &s;oon a&s;&s;ume &s;uch rights over me, as have rendered my life truly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>The count, &s;ince my mother's decea&s;e, took to his hou&s;e a very rich old maiden &s;i&s;ter, who trea&s;ured up her con&s;iderable finances for his &s;on. This woman doated &s;o much on her nephew as to call him her jewel, her happine&s;s; &s;he could never find terms &s;trong enough to expre&s;s her fondne&s;s and affection. Not|with&s;tanding, &s;he e&s;teemed me, and had much more regard for me, than &s;he &s;aw the young gentleman would conde&s;cend to honor me with. In con&s;equence, I put up with all their oddities, and hoped that all this
<PB N="224" REF="030364_0227_0FE5D386330A1DC8">
complai&s;ance to the jewel of the hou&s;e would make it po&s;&s;ible for me to live in &s;ome comfort.</P>
<P>I was twenty, and had three times repeated my cour&s;e of &s;tudy, when the count would have his hotel to be my con&s;tant re&s;idence. I joyfully accepted his offer; and of all the profe&s;&s;ions which he left to my choice, I gave the preference to a military life, though he &s;eemed to advi&s;e me to take holy orders, fore&s;eeing that I could not then fail to leave, one day, my whole e&s;|tate to his &s;on, or the heirs of his body. Neverthele&s;s, he would not force my inclinations, and purcha&s;ed me a lieutenancy in the regiment of Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>I was very well at my guardian's, where I had no other vexation than the tricks and malicious proceed|ings of my brother; but for the&s;e I con&s;oled my&s;elf with my friend Dulys: he, like me, had fini&s;hed the cour&s;e of his cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies, and was now &s;tudying law to qualify him&s;elf for the bar. His mother had put him to board with a gentleman in the neighborhood, where we could &s;ee one another at all hours. The marquis and all the family were fond of him, and he was indeed the common friend of us all, except my brother, who could not bear him: but little did Dulys trouble him&s;elf about him, and we were all well con|tent.</P>
<P>My di&s;po&s;ition was &s;edentary, gloomy, and philo&s;o|phical.&mdash;I had no ruling pa&s;&s;ion nor ta&s;tes: &s;tudy and reading were my &s;ole delight. Dulys was of the &s;ame ca&s;t; we would often &s;pend whole days in reading and making reflections.&mdash;Women were one day the topic of oar conver&s;ation; Dulys particulari&s;ed all the dangers to which marriage e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;ed a man, in the mo&s;t heinous colours; he depicted marriage as a fatal dungeon which fetters the freedom of our being, and who&s;e bands neither dome&s;tic cro&s;&s;es, nor the caprices of a &s;pou&s;e can di&s;&s;olve. Doubtle&s;s, he argued like an in|experienced young man; but I li&s;tened to his argu|ments, the re&s;ult of which was a mutual oath never to marry.&mdash;A fooli&s;h, &s;en&s;ele&s;s promi&s;e, never made, but when the pa&s;&s;ions lay dormant in our brea&s;t!&mdash;Frail &s;tructure, which the lea&s;t wind can overthrow!&mdash;To my &s;orrow I felt it but too much afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="030364_0228_0FE5D39D4E75A130">
Count d'Anfort, who was a man of parts, enjoyed our whole confidence: I kept nothing &s;ecret from him, and was &s;o imprudent as to communicate to him the firm re&s;olution I had taken. The project flattered his views; he &s;econded it, be&s;towed a thou&s;and eulogi|ums on me, and was eager to carry the news to the counte&s;s d'Ezelle, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">dmother, an old lady uncom|monly rich, who was very fond of me, and had prom|i&s;ed many times to con&s;titute me her &s;ole and univer&s;al heir. This counte&s;s, who was equally blind with re|gard to the chevalier d'Anfort, was glad to &s;ee that her intentions &s;hould become u&s;eful one day, to that dear family. Being therefore &s;ick of a dangerous di&s;|order, &s;ome time after, &s;he ordered us all to her bed|&s;ide, and dictated, in our pre&s;ence the different articles of her will. Cor&s;ange, &s;aid &s;he to me, the mo&s;t tender friend&s;hip united me with your father; I have made you my &s;ucce&s;&s;or, I am rich, and owe my fortune to no one: to you I bequeath the whole bulk of my e&s;tate, but on condition of your &s;igning a deed before wit|ne&s;&s;es, by which you are to promi&s;e me never to marry, and leave your e&s;tate after your death, in rever&s;ion to your brother, or his next heir, by due cour&s;e of law.</P>
<P>Bewildered as I was by my philo&s;ophy, I con&s;ented to all, and &s;igned all. The counte&s;s expires; count d'Anfort demands a copy of my renunciation, and takes upon him the admini&s;tration of this new e&s;tate, till I &s;hould be of age. By it, I acquired an annual income of three hundred thou&s;and livres, and upwards.</P>
<P>I leave you now to think, if, after this, my friend&s;hip was courted by the family of the count d'Anfort. Ev|ery body care&s;&s;ed me, even the chevalier received or|ders from his father to treat me with more gentle|ne&s;s and politene&s;s; in &s;hort, as a per&s;on of high value.</P>
<P>I had unknowingly &s;igned my ruin, and repented not; Dulys too, who was as mad as my&s;elf, endeav|ored to confirm me in my principles, and I was hap|py! You &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, my friends to what cata&s;tro|phs my imprudent conduct has &s;ubjected me! The&s;e particulars have perhaps been tedious to you; they were neverthele&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to lead you to the more in|tere&s;ting

part of my adventures. Prepare your&s;elves to hear a &s;eries of horrors and unju&s;t actions, brooded by the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t baleful malignity.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s D'Anfort, my &s;tep father's &s;i&s;ter, had a friend, who was baron d'Arceville. That friend, who had been a widower long &s;ince, lived with his only daugh|ter at one of his manors. He frequently wrote to mi&s;s d'Anfort, who had been very intimate with his late &s;pou&s;e. One day &s;he received a letter from the baron, in which he mentioned among other things: "That as &s;ome urging affairs called him to the We&s;t-Indies, he was obliged to &s;it out within a month. As I dare not, added he, expo&s;e my daughter to the hazards of &s;o long a voyage, and firmly rely upon our ancient friend&s;hip, I &s;hall make bold to put her under your care, for the time I &s;hall be ab&s;ent. I hope you will not refu&s;e me that &s;ervice:&mdash;We &s;hall be in Paris by the end of this week at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s d'Anfort, enraptured with her friend's confi|dence in her, ordered an apartment to be fitted up for his reception, and another for her young pupil. You &s;hall &s;ee mi&s;s d'Arceville, would &s;he &s;ay to us, every now and then; &s;he is &s;o hand&s;ome, oh! &s;o very hand|&s;ome!

<P>I li&s;tened to this di&s;cour&s;e with indifference, far from thinking that this ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pted daughter &s;hould make me renounce forever what I had &s;worn. In vain we wait|ed for the baron on the day he had appointed; it was late at night, and nobody came. The next day pa&s;|&s;ed in the like manner, and on the morning of the third we &s;aw arrive a man alone, pale, bewildered, and &s;eem|ingly given up to the mo&s;t gnawing &s;orrow. Eh! my dear friend, &s;aid mi&s;s d'Anfort! is it you?&mdash;My God! what a &s;ituation you are in!&mdash;Where is your daughter?&mdash;My daughter! my daughter!&mdash;I have lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t my poor daughter!&mdash;O Heaven! is &s;he dead?&mdash;I cannot tell.&mdash;You cannot tell! pray explain your&s;elf, what has then happened?</P>
<P>The baron &s;its down, compo&s;es him&s;elf a little, and &s;ometime afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;peaks as follows:</P>

We were in the vicinity of the &s;ubur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the city of <HI>Nevers,</HI> when a man in a phaeton, attended by one &s;er|vant, drove again&s;t my carriage, and had nearly over|turned it. Sir, &s;aid I to him, take care of what you are at!&mdash;He an&s;wers me rudely:&mdash;I reply in the &s;ame &s;train&mdash;The in&s;olent &s;tranger even dares to give me a la&s;h with his whip. I alight and draw my &s;word&mdash;we fight: I have the misfortune to kill him!&mdash;Nei|ther the cries of my daughter, tho&s;e of our &s;ervants, nor any thing can withhold me; the &s;tranger lies dead on the field; his valet &s;ought his &s;afety in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light. I &s;tept into my carriage, and order the po&s;tilion to drive hard. In the evening of that &s;ame day, a po&s;t chai&s;e, which drove with the greate&s;t rapidity, &s;topped my carriage;&mdash;four men &s;tepped out&mdash;they attack me, my re&s;i&s;tance was vain:&mdash;one of them wounds me, I drop down &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and only recover to &s;ee my&s;elf, bereft of my daughter. Arzelia was no more with me, Arzelia had been carried off by tho&s;e four ruffians. Germain, my valet, who gave me every &s;uccor in his power, &s;aw her &s;eized and put into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, without being able to give her the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In &s;hort, I have lo&s;t my dear Arzelia. I know not whi|ther &s;he has been carried! I &s;tept again into my car|riage, and here you &s;ee me forlorn and cruelly injured!&mdash;What a fatal adventure, cried mi&s;s d'Anfort!&mdash;and what do you think of it?&mdash;I can form no judgment whatever with any probability&mdash;the young man who in&s;ulted me was dead; I had laid him &s;prawling on the ground&mdash;Who can then have taken away my poor Arzelia?</P>
<P>The unhappy baron yielded again to his grief, and we endeavored to con&s;ole him, but to no purpo&s;e: we could not pacify him, otherwi&s;e than by promi&s;ing to accompany him to the mini&s;ter, to whom he intended to di&s;clo&s;e the whole affair, and who alone had it in his power to &s;olve the problem.</P>

alighted before the Thuilleries, where count d'Anfort begged us to &s;tay, till he &s;hould have terminated an affair with a per&s;on who lived in that palace.</P>
<P>While the count was gone, I and the baron walked about in the gardens. The baron always repeated how grievous he was at his lo&s;s, and I endeavored, though in vain, to di&s;&s;ipate his &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Night advancing, and the count not coming back, the baron, impatient of &s;eeing him, intended to enquire into the cau&s;e which detained him.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE DELIGHTS AND TORMENTS OF LOVE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>JUDGE of my fright and con&s;ternation! I que&s;tion my guards: none of them an&s;wer.&mdash;Defencele&s;s as I was, I could not make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance&mdash;I was forced to wait in &s;ilence, the i&s;&s;ue of &s;o extraordinary an event&mdash;But, how I &s;uffered!&mdash;You may form your&s;elf an idea of my &s;ituation, if you only put your|&s;elf for a moment in my place.</P>
<P>As far as I am able to gue&s;s, we rode two whole days through the country; becau&s;e the doors of the carriage being &s;hut, I could not &s;ee the cities, towns and villages through which we pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;My guides of|fered me &s;ome victuals which I refu&s;ed to accept: I begged them again to let me know what they wanted of me; but they were as mute as ever.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we &s;topped, and a moment after, the carriage pa&s;&s;ed under &s;ome vaults, as I gue&s;&s;ed from its hollow and rattling &s;ounds. We alighted, in the dead of night, in a &s;pacious yard, before an edifice which had more the appearance of a ca&s;tle than a private hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I a&s;cended &s;ome &s;teps, and entered a hall exceeding|ly well illuminated; here the cloth was laid, and the table full of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite viands. One of my guides a&s;ked me to &s;it down to &s;upper.&mdash;No, barbarous wretch, replied I; make ha&s;te and &s;trike your victim! We have no &s;uch thoughts, &s;ir; will you plea&s;e to eat &s;omething?</P>
<P>Always &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ervant's invitation to be iron|ical, I refu&s;ed. He then conducted me to another room, where the mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;pectacle &s;uddenly engag|ed my attention. A coffin aro&s;e in the middle of the apartment, which was quite hung with black. A few wax candles lighted it; an aged and gha&s;tly figure of a man, melting in tears, leaned on the bier. O my &s;on! cried he, thou &s;halt be revenged, not by the ju&s;t rigor of the laws, it would be too &s;low in &s;erving my fury.&mdash;Barbarous &s;tranger, I will puni&s;h thee in a
<PB N="230" REF="030364_0233_0FE5D3604D9CE4D0">
manner&mdash;Yes, I &s;hall &s;trike thee with the &s;ame blow which has pierced my heart!</P>
<P>The&s;e words almo&s;t forced tears from my eyes!&mdash;the old man hearing a noi&s;e, looks around, perceives me, makes a ge&s;ture of amazement, and &s;ays to his va|let who conducted me to him, "Awkward fellow,&mdash;What bu&s;ine&s;s have I with this gentleman? How im|prudent!&mdash;Go, let him be re-conducted as you have brought him."&mdash;He looks once more about, then turns his back.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive how much the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew words calmed me!&mdash;I, who believed my&s;elf de&s;tined to be offered up a victim to the manes of that &s;on I had nev|er known, &s;aw my&s;elf at once freed from danger through a mi&s;take made by the &s;ervants!&mdash;Oh, what comfort diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in my heart.</P>
<P>My guide having laid hold of my hand, made me re-enter the parlor where the table was &s;o well &s;erved. He invited me a third time to take &s;omething. Now, I would not have him repeat it again, being no more unea&s;y, and having not ate &s;ince two days, I &s;et down without ceremony to that &s;ingular table, and &s;upped with a very good appetite. The valet, who waited on me, expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t contrition for his mi&s;take; I wi&s;hed from the bottom of my heart he would accom|pany me alone, confident to get from him &s;ome intel|ligence of this &s;urpri&s;ing adventure.&mdash;It happened as I wi&s;hed: they covered my eyes with a blind; we both &s;tepped in the &s;ame chai&s;e which had brought me, and the coachman followed the road to Paris.</P>
<P>I did not he&s;itate a moment longer to urge my com|panion to tell me what he knew in re&s;pect to this affair; I begged and intreated, and concluded with offering him my pur&s;e, a reward of an hundred lous d'ors, and a place in my-hou&s;e, if he would leave his ma&s;ter and &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity. The valet, moved with all the&s;e brilliant offers, accepted them, and related the follow|ing &s;tory:</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know, &s;ir, that my ma&s;ter's &s;on, on his return from Paris, was attacked, near the city of Ne|vers, by a gentleman attended by a &s;ingle lady and a &s;ervant. The gentleman &s;ought a duel with my young
<PB N="231" REF="030364_0234_0FE59AFA4ECE5820">
ma&s;ter, who in con&s;equence of it was left dead on the field, and his antagoni&s;t continued quietly his way in his carriage. Being bu&s;y in lifting my young ma&s;ter from the ground, I could only remark the carriage which fled with the murderer and a lady, his compani|on.&mdash;Quite di&s;con&s;olate at this fatal event, I brought the corp&s;e of my ma&s;ter to his father, and told him the whole affair. After having given vent to his grief, that unhappy father &s;ays to me, in a re&s;olute tone, Wilt thou know again the villain who has bereft me of my &s;on?&mdash;Yes &s;ir, and his carriage too.&mdash;Well, then, let us &s;et out.</P>
<P>"This &s;aid, he takes with him four or five &s;ervants; we get into a light chai&s;e and po&s;ted away with &s;uch di&s;patch that we perceived in the evening the carriage we were in pur&s;uit of, which could not go fa&s;t, becau&s;e one of the hor&s;es was wounded. We attack the mur|derer; he re&s;i&s;ts vigorou&s;ly. My ma&s;ter pierces him; he falls, uttering the name of his daughter. His daughter, cried my ma&s;ter, &s;he &s;hall die! At the&s;e words, he ordered us to carry her off. We were on the point of laying al&s;o hold of the father, when &s;ome hor&s;e|men in full gallop made us afraid of being mole&s;ted; we therefore returned to our chai&s;e, and &s;afely con|ducted our prey to the ca&s;tle. Since that time &s;he has been confined in a dark hole. My ma&s;ter, who &s;pends day and night in bewailing his &s;on, will have her to be &s;acrificed upon his coffin. How &s;avage! Oh! you don't know him, &s;ir, he is a man extremely cruel, violent, and revengeful. This is not all yet; he has me|ditated a &s;cheme of vengeance, a thou&s;and times more hineous. The day before ye&s;terday, he gave us orders to go to Paris, to fetch the father of that unfortunate young lady. Some of us having &s;een him in the royal gar|dens of the Thuilleries!&mdash;we watched him till night and probably induced to a mi&s;take by your &s;hape or your dre&s;s, which was of the &s;ame color as his, we car|ried you off in&s;tead of him.&mdash;Wretches, it is Arzelia!&mdash;O heaven! proceed in your &s;tory! What did he want of that unhappy father?&mdash;He intended to re|proach him with the death of his &s;on, to &s;tay his daughter before his own eyes; and then, perhaps, to
<PB N="232" REF="030364_0235_0FE5D3C9AD6CE418">
confine him for life in the dark hole of his ca&s;tle&mdash;What a mon&s;ter!&mdash;Oh! my friend, I beg thee, if we can &s;ave Arzelia, I will give thee two hundred louis d'ors, three hundred&mdash;nay, my whole fortune is at thy di&s;po&s;al!&mdash;It is not an ea&s;y ta&s;k, &s;ir; but never mind, we mu&s;t make intere&s;t with the coachman.</P>
<P>That in&s;tant my man &s;tops the chai&s;e: we were then in a remote and &s;olitary di&s;trict of the country. He therefore propo&s;ed to to the coachman either to &s;ave Arzelia, or to prepare for immediate death. The propo&s;al was very categorical; the coachman con|&s;ents to take the reward which is offered to him;&mdash;and we returned with the greate&s;t expedition to the place from whence we came, which was only at the di&s;tance of one league from <HI>Nevers.</HI> The night was propitious to our undertaking. The two dome&s;tics en|ter the ca&s;tle; the coachman had the keys of the dun|geon in which the innocent Arzelia had been thrown&mdash;he calls her, lays hold of her hand, and brings her to the carriage where I waited for her with the greate&s;t im|patience. Every body being a&s;leep in the ca&s;tle, the e&s;cape was effected without any ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>How impatient was I to &s;ee the fair captive!&mdash;&s;he finally arrives with her two deliverers&mdash;we &s;tep into the chai&s;e, and leave the place with the utmo&s;t precip|itation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not repeat the heartfelt thanks of the baron's daughter; her grief, her misfortunes, her beauty, nay, all in her gave me the mo&s;t tender concern: I look at her and &s;uddenly my liberty is gone; I felt a &s;ingular revolution in my being. My eyes, my tongue, my heart, all my faculties are captivated. Surpri&s;ed at my &s;ituation, I &s;earch for the object which cau&s;es it, and as quickly a&s;cribe it to the concern I felt for her per&s;on: vague excu&s;e of the heart, which for the fir&s;t time feels the power of love! indeed, what I con|&s;idered as an impul&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion, was actually the fir&s;t &s;hoot of a ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, which was &s;oon to main|tain an imperious domination over my heart. The charming Arzelia felt on the other hand, the &s;ame e|motion. Whether from gratitude or &s;ympathy, &s;he blu&s;hed, ca&s;t her beauteous eyes on another object,
<PB N="233" REF="030364_0236_0FE5D39E158FBEB0">
was afraid to look in my face, and could only a&s;k how her father did: this confu&s;ion, which we felt mutual|ly increa&s;ed &s;o much on the road, that when we ar|rived at Paris, the lea&s;t di&s;cerning eye mu&s;t &s;urely have perceived that our &s;entiments were pa&s;t beyond the limits of friend&s;hip. And &s;uch events have proved them afterwards.</P>
<P>Meanwhile I took care to &s;end back the carriage to the cruel proprietor of the ca&s;tle, by a &s;tranger, to whom I al&s;o delivered a letter. I wrote to Arzelia's enemy in an anonymous manner, and without giving him any direction; I informed him of my good fortune to re&s;tore a daughter to a father, &s;ignifying that &s;hould he ever attempt the lea&s;t method of revenge, he ought to tremble for his life; as I had it in my power to &s;urrender him to ju&s;tice, being &s;upported by two indi|viduals who had witne&s;&s;ed his enormities, and by the depo&s;ition of the innocent victim whom he intended to &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>This was indeed the expedient I &s;hould have made u&s;e of when I fir&s;t left the ca&s;tle, rather than to have liberated his prey by &s;tratagem; but the remedy was too violent, and I feared for the life of Arzelia, though ignorant as yet of the great lo&s;s I would have &s;u&s;tain|ed&punc;</P>
<P>We found the hotel d'Anfort in the greate&s;t con|&s;ternation. The baron and my guardian having not found me on the appointed &s;pot, went home; but how a&s;toni&s;hed was all the family, when the whole night elap&s;ed, and I did not return!&mdash;Four days more glid|ed in the &s;ame manner, and they receive no intelligence from me! What could have befallen me? All en|quiries proved fruitle&s;s. The count, believing I had been murdered, &s;hed real tears of &s;incerity: his &s;on had already worn out his grief: mi&s;s d'Anfort was quite di&s;con&s;olate; and the baron, bereft of his daughter, without hope of ever &s;eeing her again, had &s;et out for the We&s;t-Indies on the night before my return. When he parted from Mi&s;s d'Anfort, he re|commended her, his poor Arzelia, if ever &s;he &s;hould be brought to light again.&mdash;You will be her mother, added he, till heaven plea&s;es to &s;end me back to my
<PB N="234" REF="030364_0237_0FE5D3B5003DB8C8">
native land! This is the &s;ervice I exact of your friend|&s;hip. But what do I &s;ay?&mdash;She is lo&s;t to me, and to you al&s;o&mdash;my Arzelia is lo&s;t!&mdash;Ah! no doubt &s;he is dead!&mdash;The mon&s;ters, who ravi&s;hed her, have made her a victim of vengeance. Adieu! my friends; far from this abode I will terminate my wretched career, the world is a wilderne&s;s to me, &s;ince my poor daugh|ter has been &s;natched from my arms!</P>
<P>The count and mi&s;s d'Anfort, who were al&s;o over|whelmed with a grief of their own, tried, though in vain, to detain their friends: he &s;at out and left them to their &s;orrow.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t Arzelia have felt, my friends, when &s;he heard the news of her father's departure? As to my relations, the adventure which I related &s;eemed &s;o &s;in|gular to them, as to heighten their joy at &s;eeing me returned. My brother, alone, &s;eemed not much mov|ed; but my good friend Dulys! Oh! how he em|braced me! how he cla&s;ped me in his arms!&mdash;O heaven! that deprives me of a father and a mother! I had never ta&s;ted the &s;weets of parental fondne&s;s;&mdash;but how did friend&s;hip compen&s;ate for them!</P>
<P>Meanwhile, mi&s;s d'Anfort lo&s;t no time: the baron had given her his addre&s;s at the i&s;land of Orleron; whether &s;he immediately di&s;patched a letter, with the tidings of his daughter's return; he could not as yet have completed his voyage, but mu&s;t have received the letter upon his di&s;embarkation, and his &s;orrows were to be at an end. This conduct of mi&s;s d'Anfort calmed every mind. Peace re&s;umed her empire in the hotel; but it was not of a long continuance. My brother did not &s;ee the fair Arzelia with indifference; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e fell de&s;perately in love with her, and as enamoured eyes are more prying than the eyes of friend&s;hip, he was the fir&s;t aware of a mutual affection. Indeed, Arzelia knew my &s;entiments: &s;he had di&s;clo&s;ed her heart to me; in &s;hort, we loved one another, and were con&s;cious of our pa&s;&s;ion! Dulys, who could not dive into the my&s;tery, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> made our confidant; in vain were all his remon&s;trances without number, philo&s;ophy ceded to the violence of love; my friend pitied me; he promi&s;ed to do the utmo&s;t of his power to &s;erve
<PB N="235" REF="030364_0238_0FE5D3632AE73B08">
me; and repented the cruel renunciation he had made me &s;ign. It was too late, the count had the deed in his own hands; he was my guardian, and maintained over me an authority which I was not able then to &s;hake off; on the other hand, I loved, I re&s;pected, and always trembled before him.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I tell you, my friends?&mdash;Love led us a&s;tray: I and Arzelia contracted a clande&s;tine marriage.&mdash;A country hou&s;e belonging to mi&s;s d'Anfort be|came &s;ub&s;ervient to that purpo&s;e&mdash;Thither we were gone to &s;pend a few days. One morning, the count, his &s;on, and mi&s;s d'Anfort being a&s;leep; Arzelia, her woman, Dulys and I, repaired to the chapel of a con|vent, &s;ituate at the di&s;tance of one league from mi&s;s d'Anfort's country &s;eat.&mdash;We made intere&s;t with the prie&s;t; and an attorney was pre&s;ent at the ceremony.</P>
<P>Dulys and a friend of his &s;erved as witne&s;&s;es, and we vowed eternal tenderne&s;s to each other: incon&s;id|erate mea&s;ure! Ah! how dear have we paid for it!</P>
<P>The whole affair was con&s;ummated in le&s;s than two hours. At eight o'clock, we returned to the hou&s;e and found every body up. They made very merry at our morning walk; blamed us for not having men|tioned it the night before, as they would have accom|panied us; and here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he whole &s;ubject was dropped: young d'Anfort alone took umbrage at the proceed|ing. From that moment, he &s;et people to watch us, and &s;oon he di&s;covered, if not our clande&s;tine marriage, at lea&s;t the intimacy which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us.</P>
<P>How enraged mu&s;t he have been! he had been fru&s;trated in all the declaration of love he had made to my &s;pou&s;e; he dete&s;ted me, he envied my property; in fine he wi&s;hed me to perform the promi&s;e I had made in writing: and he &s;aw me loved in return, and prepared for ties, to which the baron, at his return, could not object, from a &s;en&s;e of gratitude which he owed to me, who had &s;aved his daughter from the jaws of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>All the tran&s;ports of hatred, jealou&s;y, rage and ven|geance, &s;eized upon his heart:&mdash;he began with in|forming his father and aunt of all he knew, and car|ried matters &s;o far as to require them to put me in
<PB N="236" REF="030364_0239_0FE5D3B68DA8BC10">
confinement, and to throw Arzelia in a convent;&mdash;violent and impracticable proceedings, no doubt, but two moderate for the in&s;ult which he pretended to have received.</P>
<P>The count heard his &s;on with all the coolne&s;s of a man of ripe and fair experience; he repre&s;ented to him the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of having recour&s;e to &s;imilar ex|tremities, and advi&s;ed gentler means. The young man at the&s;e wi&s;e coun&s;els, wept, howled, plucked off his hair, and threatened to kill him&s;elf if his father would not treat me with the utmo&s;t rigor and &s;ever|ity! The old man, intimidated, con&s;oled his &s;on, beg|ged him to di&s;card his gloomy re&s;olution, and promi&s;|ed to do every thing.&mdash;What weakne&s;s! In con&s;e|quence, mi&s;s d'Anfort received orders to &s;peak to Ar|zelia; and the count propo&s;ed him&s;elf to take me to ta&s;k.</P>
<P>We were wholly ignorant of the chevalier's arti|fice; and I imagined our loves were a perfect my&s;|tery! What was my &s;urpri&s;e, when one day my guar|dian ordered me to his cabinet, and addre&s;&s;ed me with the following &s;peech, in a prudent but mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionate tone:</P>

age has invalidated. The promi&s;e is fair, the laws &s;hall decide it. Laws are not tyrants!&mdash;You behave your&s;elf di&s;re&s;pectfully, audacious youth! Depart, fear my anger, or you are undone!&mdash;But, &s;ir,&mdash;Depart, I &s;ay, or I'll make you obey!"</P>
<P>The count frowns at me, and leaves me to my grief&mdash;I go out in hopes to &s;ee my &s;pou&s;e&mdash;I find her melting in tears. Ah! cries &s;he, &s;peak to me no more! our life is at &s;take! Mi&s;s d'Anforth, I will &s;a|crifice my&s;elf for you! only wait my father's return.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, mi&s;s d'Anforth appears: they both &s;tep in a carriage and I &s;ee my unfortunate &s;pou&s;e depart, without knowing whither &s;he is conducted, or if we &s;hall ever meet again!</P>
<P>I kindled with rage; and I endeavored to follow the carriage; the &s;ervants hinder me.&mdash;I run up and down the hou&s;e, called aloud for my brother, and had he appeared, I believe his life would have been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, heaven pre&s;erved me from that crime; it &s;ent Dulys to be my comforter. Dulys came, I told him all that had happened; and a&s;ked his ad|vice. My friend, an&s;wered he, I have no other ad|vice to give you, than to obey your &s;tep-father's com|mands; go, and &s;tay for &s;ome time at Be&s;ancon. This will give me time to do for you what ever &s;hall be in my power: I will endeavor to appea&s;e every mind: depart, my dear marquis, and leave to my care your happine&s;s. I &s;hall di&s;cover the retreat of your &s;pou&s;e; I &s;hall &s;ee her: &s;he &s;hall hear of you, and an epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed. We have both been guilty of imprudence with regard to that fatal renunciation; but it is not valid&mdash;it wants a clau&s;e;&mdash;it becomes u&s;ele&s;s to your tyrants.&mdash;I'll convince you of it &s;ome other time, now depart; this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion will perhaps have a better effect than your menaces.</P>
<P>I &s;et out loaded with the reproaches of the count and mi&s;s d'Anfort. I arrived at Be&s;ancon; and on the next morning received a letter from Dulys, pur|porting that my wife was confined in a convent, in the <HI>Rue d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Temple</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d that Mi&s;s d'Antfort had

cajoled and threatened her into it, that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to &s;peak to her, but time would &s;oon be productive of a change.</P>
<P>This news overwhelmed me with de&s;pair; I an|&s;wered my friend's letter, and was a little more ea&s;y.</P>
<P>One day I received a very long letter from Dulys, which made me completely mi&s;erable; I cannot help giving you &s;ome extracts from it, becau&s;e nothing can era&s;e it from my memory.</P>
<P>My friend, mi&s;s d'Anfort has received letters from the i&s;land of Oleron, that baron d'Arceville was dead!&mdash;He was &s;carce arrived, but he received the letter, purporting his daughter's return; his joy was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive that he could only write the&s;e few lines, of which I &s;end you a copy:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"Mi&s;s d'Anfort, I feel the approach of death!&mdash;Take care of my daughter&mdash;I have no relations: be her mother&mdash;You &s;hall receive, by a faithful me&s;&s;en|ger, a complete inventory of my titles and my proper|ty.

<P>That faithful me&s;&s;enger is arrived: he delivered into mi&s;s d'Anfort's hands, property to a very great a|mount. Thus Arzelia mu&s;t &s;olely depend on her for a maintenance. Alas! how I pity you!</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. I forgot to tell you, that mi&s;s d'Anfort, who doubted not a moment, that the lovely nephew, mentioned in the letter of her expiring friend, could be any other but her darling chevalier, has already made every preparation for their marriage; he goes every day with his aunt to the convent in which Arzelia is &s;hut up, and, &s;hall I tell you, he leaves it apparently much &s;atisfied. I have not been able as yet to &s;peak to your &s;pou&s;e; either &s;he does not read your letters and mine, or &s;he thinks them not worth an&s;wering."</P>

By this letter Dulys ulcerated my very heart! Not that cro&s;&s;ed love was a &s;ufficient torment, I was al&s;o to be laid on the rack of jealou&s;y!</P>

<P>At this, my friends, I could not moderate my tran&s;-Ports! I doubted no longer of Arzelia's infidelity, and re&s;olved that in&s;tant, to &s;et off for Paris. There, &s;aid I, by my&s;elf I will di&s;cover my marriage, and &s;eek re|dre&s;s from ju&s;tice of the laws.</P>
<P>I had now been eight months at Be&s;ancon, and compelled by duty to &s;tay one week longer. I fixed my departure for the Monday following. Having prepared every thing on Sunday morning, I went, in the afternoon, to take leave of my &s;uperior officers, and when I retired at night to go to re&s;t, a &s;ingular ad|venture happened, which cured me at once of my jealou&s;y, and prolonged my &s;tay at Be&s;ancon:&mdash;Hear it my friends, I am &s;ure you would not expect it.</P>

<P>THE clock &s;truck eight, when I reached my lod|gings; I was gloomy, and ab&s;orbed in thought. A woman &s;habbily dre&s;&s;ed acco&s;ts me&mdash;&s;he &s;eemed to be extremely indigent. Sir, &s;aid &s;he, in a weak and &s;uffering tone, relieve me with &s;ome little gratuity?</P>
<P>My mind was &s;o much pre-occupied with other ob|jects, that I rebuked the woman without any farther

reflection; &s;he per&s;everes in her &s;olicitations&mdash;I rebuke her again. I go, &s;aid &s;he, but heaven will puni&s;h you! Heaven! exclaimed I, what a re&s;emblance! what a voice! Arzelia! Yes, ungrateful marquis! it is Ar|zelia!&mdash;I wi&s;hed to &s;ee if you would know me. But how!&mdash;in &s;uch an appearance? To it I owe the bli&s;s of &s;eeing you again. It is a precious dre&s;s! O, my wor|thy &s;pou&s;e, don't &s;peak &s;o loud, perhaps I'm followed!</P>
<P>Her &s;uppo&s;ition was ju&s;t: &s;he goes with me to my lodgings, &s;its down, and gives me an account of what had happened to her, which my tran&s;ports of joy in|terrupted an hundered times.</P>
<P>"Forced by the advice and threats of mi&s;s d'Anfort, I followed her to a convent, where &s;he left me, giving orders to the mother abbe&s;s, not to &s;uffer any body to conver&s;e with me. The next day &s;he came to &s;ee me again, and was exact in her vi&s;its every &s;ub&s;equent day. I wi&s;h you had &s;een her in our conver&s;ations, how &s;he extolled the chevalier's merits, and every ef|fort to repre&s;ent you as vicious. "My dear, &s;aid &s;he, Cor&s;ange cannot marry you; he has legally re|nounced marriage, and if he perjures him&s;elf, he for|feits an annual income of two hundred thou&s;and li|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">res.

<P>"This di&s;cour&s;e rou&s;ed my indignation; but I was too much afraid &s;he would gue&s;s our &s;ecret, had I then given her a deci&s;ive an&s;wer. From that in&s;tant, Mi&s;s d'Anfort imagined &s;he had conquered my heart for her nephew; and when &s;he informed me of the death of my father, &s;he dwelt chiefly upon that pa&s;&s;age of the letter, where he ordered me, &s;aid &s;he, to give the che|valier your hand. I &s;aw him every day with her, and they became &s;o a&s;&s;iduous and intruding, that I had &s;carcely time to peru&s;e your letters: I dared not to an&s;wer them, le&s;t I &s;hould confide in a per&s;on that might betray me. The &s;ervant whom Mr. Dulys &s;ent might have been prevailed upon to take a bribe, and

we would have been undone.&mdash;I had al&s;o another motive to be cautious again&s;t my tyrants&mdash;dear hu&s;|band, I am pregnant!&mdash;O God! Yes, my dear, I expect every minute to bring to light that precious pledge: and this made me e&s;cape from my pri&s;on, and meet you here!&mdash;My dear &s;pou&s;e, how was you able to effect that e&s;cape? Oh, it was a bold expedi|ent! but it proved &s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;An unfortunate and very poor old woman came often to beg alms of the nuns; &s;he conceived &s;o great an attachment for me, as to &s;pend whole days in my apartment: I liked her, and was much entertained with her wit and conver&s;a|tion. I thought her a fit in&s;trument to deliver my|&s;elf from &s;lavery. In con&s;equence I told her my &s;itu|ation; and from the concern which &s;he &s;eemed to feel for me, I reque&s;ted her to change her dre&s;s for mine, or rather to bring one like that &s;he had on, and to lend me her own. She agreed to my demand. Thus e|quipped, and fearing to bring the poor woman into trouble on my account. I let her go out before me. When I &s;aw through my window, that &s;he was at a good di&s;tance in the &s;treets, I ventured my&s;elf down &s;tairs in the &s;ame dre&s;s, in hopes to make my e&s;cape. The good old woman u&s;ed to come to and fro &s;o often in a day, that the dome&s;tics were accu&s;tomed to it.&mdash;I &s;tooped, pulled my cap over my no&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ing be|fore the porter, even took care to make a crooked bow, which made the fellow laugh. Well, mother, &s;aid he, you ju&s;t went out, how did you get in?&mdash;Without lo&s;ing a minute by giving him an an&s;wer, I advanced, and as &s;oon as I was in the &s;treet, run as hard as I could to the po&s;t-office, where I prepared my&s;elf to &s;et out without delay. The po&s;t-ma&s;ter made &s;ome difficulty, but dazzling him with my gold, he could no longer with&s;tand my demand. I remain|ed under this di&s;gui&s;e all the way, for &s;ear of being di&s;|covered. Now I &s;ee thee again, my dear hu&s;band, I am no longer grieved."</P>
<P>I embraced Arzelia, and begged her to take &s;ome &s;u&s;tenance. Meanwhile I feared the pur&s;uits of our tyrants. We of cour&s;e determined to take other lodg|ings on the next day, or rather to leave the town. But
<PB N="242" REF="030364_0245_0FE5D38AA37E26B0">
all the&s;e projects were &s;ubverted by our friend Dulys, who entered our apartment in the dead of night, and had but time to utter the&s;e few words:&mdash;Fly, un|fortunate couple, the count and his &s;on are at my heels!</P>
<P>Arzelia &s;wooned: I went to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but &s;o violent was the effect of her panic, that &s;he was deliv|ered of a child! how embarra&s;&s;ing was my &s;ituation! I had no light, my door was open, I take my little Alexis in my arms!&mdash;Several voices cry: Where are they?&mdash;Where are they? Dulys leaves the room, to keep off my tyrants. I attempt to &s;hut my door.&mdash;A man oppo&s;es me, enters, in &s;pite of me, tears the child from my arms, and endeavors to run away. I become quite frantic, and &s;uddenly take my &s;word: <HI>Treacherous d'Anfort! Thou &s;halt be puni&s;hed!</HI> I pur&s;ue the man who carries off my child, overtake him at the bottom of the &s;tairs, thru&s;t the &s;teel in his body, and retake the new-born infant. Heaven! what terror &s;truck me!&mdash;I heard a dying voice: <HI>Cruel Cor&s;ange! Could'&s;t thou &s;lay thy friend, when he &s;aved thee?</HI> It was the voice of Dulys! it was Dulys I &s;tabbed!&mdash;O remor&s;e!</P>
<P>Meanwhile this noi&s;e had &s;pread the alarm among the &s;ervants of the inn; they come up &s;tairs, followed by count d'Anfort and his &s;on!&mdash;What mu&s;t have been my feelings, when, lights being brought, I &s;aw Dulys &s;prawling on the ground, and weltering in his blood! Heaven! that dreadful &s;cene is &s;till before mine eyes! My guardian and his &s;on are moved; they &s;top and rai&s;e the unfortunate victim.

<P>The count in&s;i&s;ts upon my obedience; I fall in a pa&s;|&s;ion: my rage, &s;till more aggravated at the pre&s;ence of my brother, becomes exce&s;&s;ive.&mdash;My guardian, who &s;earing the con&s;equences, re&s;olves to withdraw; he takes his &s;on with him, and leaves me alone by the bed of my &s;pou&s;e, to whom I give every &s;uccor in my power!&mdash;Soon &s;he opens her eyes; &s;he &s;ees me, de|mands her &s;on, embraces, and &s;miles at him. The unhappy mother was ignorant of my crime: I took care to conceal it from her, and &s;he knew it only two months after.</P>
<P>The count and his &s;on remained at the inn as long as my &s;pou&s;e was forced to keep her bed. They a|voided &s;eeing us, and we were rejoiced at it. Arzelia nur&s;ed Alexis. Dulys, who was &s;oon able to leave his room, and conde&s;cended to pardon my mi&s;take, took it upon him to find a proper nur&s;e for my &s;on, and had him chri&s;tened, becau&s;e we could not keep him with us: uncertain, if we &s;hould be &s;uffered to live together. Our marriage was void by law; the count had a right to have it di&s;&s;olved; but, on the other hand, he was much at a lo&s;s to prove the legality of the deed he had made me &s;ign, becau&s;e a gentleman of the law who had been con&s;ulted, convinced him of its nullity, becau&s;e it had been made in ha&s;te, and by an ignorant attorney. I certaintly promi&s;ed never to marry; but then I was only twenty, and it was nece&s;|&s;ary that I &s;hould ratify the promi&s;e when I came to be of age. As &s;uch, the deed would have been valid. The count, who knew all this, endeavored to intimi|date me, though he was con&s;cious that it was out of his power to hurt me; as for my own part, I was afraid le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;&s;olve my marriage; we were, there|fore, forced to adopt gentle means on both &s;ides.</P>

The day before my departure from Be&s;ancon, he entered my apartment alone: "Cor&s;ange," &s;aid he you are &s;till dear to me; I loved your mother: &s;he has entru&s;ted you to my care; &s;he ordered you to obey me as you would have obeyed her; and even to grant me all your confidence.

All that I am &s;orry for is, that I mu&s;t leave you un|happy in this world.&mdash;Alas, pity me not, I am hap|pier than you!"</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I imprinted a thou&s;and ki&s;&s;es on this letter, and ad|mired my friend's genero&s;ity, who had &s;till my inter|e&s;t at heart, even when my barbarity cau&s;ed his death!&mdash;How all this aggravated my guilt! How I abhor|red my&s;elf!&mdash;Arzelia &s;hared my &s;orrows, and we both gave tears to the mo&s;t feeling and mo&s;t generous man, who, perhaps ever exi&s;ted on earth!</P>
<P>Meanwhile, I was determined to follow the la&s;t ad|vice of Dulys, and, however repugnant I found it to di&s;&s;emble, I yielded to nece&s;&s;ity. In con&s;equence, I and Arzelia &s;pread the report of the death of our friend and the child; and our &s;orrow, of which Dulys was the &s;ole object, appeared &s;o natural to count d'Anfort and his &s;on, that they believed it, and made no farther enquiries.</P>
<P>We lived five years in our hotel, <HI>Rue de Richelieu,</HI> not without finding that the count and his family had for us a great regard. In compliance with their re|que&s;t, I and my &s;pou&s;e inhabited each a different a|partment. I might as well have freed Arzelia from that re&s;traint; but the fear of a law-&s;uit, which we &s;hould have been forced to &s;tand, in order to have our marriage confirmed, made us wait till the death of the count d'Anfort &s;hould remove that ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>I was afraid of going too often to Vitry; I en|tru&s;ted my &s;on's nur&s;e with the &s;ecret of his birth; and le&s;t the little innocent &s;hould betray him&s;elf one day, I had him brought up by the name of Alexis, and would not permit the lea&s;t hint, with regard to his family, &s;hould be given him. Thus I hoped to enjoy the &s;weets of a tranquil life, when a certain circum&s;tance came to

rou&s;e my prudence, and overthrow all my projects. I was one day walking with the count and his &s;on, in the yard of the hotel, when a milk-maid, who came from the kitchen, &s;tops, &s;tares at me, and cries out with a <HI>naivet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> which &s;he could not refrain; O lord!&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible there can be &s;uch a likene&s;s between them! What do you &s;ay, good woman, a&s;ked the chevalier? I &s;ay, my lord&mdash;I beg your pardon!&mdash;O good God!&mdash;if he was his father! Who&s;e father? Why, we have a little child at Vitry&mdash;he is an orphan, and &s;uch a pretty boy! he is ab&s;olutely like my lord there! Sure, the woman is mad, replied I&mdash;What is there to be wondered at?&mdash;Many folks re&s;emble each other. I beg your pardon, my lord;&mdash;my little Alexis! he is &s;o pretty!&mdash;Ah, you cannot think.</P>
<P>The milk-maid was going to continue her chat, which wounded my &s;oul, I take, without ceremony, the father and &s;on, to another part of the premi&s;es, and endeavor to change the &s;ubject of the conver&s;ation; but my confu&s;ion had betrayed me. A ray of light came to illuminate their mind; they began to &s;u&s;pect the cheat, and growing cooler by degrees, left me, no doubt, to con&s;ult what mea&s;ures they &s;hould adopt in that conjuncture. I was fortunate enough to read their de&s;ign in their eyes, and, without lo&s;ing time, I mount on hor&s;eback, fly to Vitry, take away my &s;on, and bring him to the Royal Botanical Garden, neither knowing what to do, or where to hide him. It was twilight, and not cho&s;ing to pa&s;s through the &s;treets of Paris with &s;o precious a trea&s;ure, I determined to enter the garden, and concert &s;ome means of conduct in my pre&s;ent dilemma. I was &s;itting on the turf, in the little grove; my &s;on was in my lap; I bathed him in my tears, and pre&s;&s;ed him to my heart, when an old lady &s;tops, looks at me, and addre&s;&s;es me as follows, in &s;o moving a tone, which tore my &s;ecret from me, even in &s;pite of my&s;elf. Alas! my dear &s;ir, are you the father of this pretty child? Yes madam. What a lovely little creature!&mdash;But you weep, have you met with &s;ome &s;ini&s;trous accident? Oh! I have indeed!

Ah! Heaven! What do you bring to my remembrance?</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation, my friends, overwhelmed me with &s;hame and confu&s;ion! To claim the &s;upport of a woman, who is the mother of the friend I have im|molated! The mother of the friend who&s;e proceedings were mo&s;t generous! Far from denouncing my guilt to his family, he had that grandeur of &s;pirit to men|tion my name only to be my eulogium. O God!

<P>Mrs. Dulys &s;eeing me turn pale, a&s;ked me the rea|&s;on of my confu&s;ion.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE FATHER OF ALEXIS CONCLUDES HIS NARRATIVE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE count's whole hou&s;e was now in confu&s;ion: The chevalier, my inveterate enemy, ju&s;t arrived from Vitry; he had threatened the good nur&s;e in &s;uch a manner, as made her confe&s;s the whole affair. He heard, that a few minutes before his arrival, I had taken away my &s;on, but was ignorant of the place to which I had conducted him. Having therefore had a council with his father and aunt, they unanimon&s;ly re&s;olved, that Mi&s;s d'Anfort &s;hould conduct Arzelia to a ca&s;tle, &s;ituate in the environs of St. Germain, and there keep her a pri&s;oner till I &s;hould have delivered up my &s;on, the object of their common hatred and pur&s;uits. I was not informed of this new di&s;a&s;ter, till the two ladies were gone. Neverthele&s;s, Arzelia found means to &s;end &s;ecretly a few lines to me, in which &s;he hinted that it was time for us to free our&s;elves from the controul of our tyrants; &s;he al&s;o &s;ent me a gold repeater, which &s;he begged me to look at every hour, that I might remember her.</P>
<P>We were really intimidated to the highe&s;t degree: Why &s;hould not we have courage to &s;hake off the chains in which our three cruel tyrants held us fettered?&mdash;Indeed, the fear of &s;eeing our marriage di&s;&s;olved, re|tained us; this apprehen&s;ion, and the deed of renunci|ation which I had &s;igned, and of who&s;e invalidity we were &s;till ignorant, bade us &s;o much defiance, that we even dared not to con&s;ult a lawyer, for fear of making our&s;elves liable to a law-&s;uit, who&s;e final i&s;&s;ue we con&s;i|dered as very fatal.</P>
<P>Thus I was forced to bear this &s;eparation, without making the lea&s;t complaint; but I found means, by the adroitne&s;s of &s;ugge&s;tion of Mrs. Dulys, to inform my &s;pou&s;e my Alexis was &s;afe. At night, when every body had retired to re&s;t in the hotel, I mounted my cour&s;er, and fled to the ca&s;tle d'Anfort, near St. Ger|main. An avenue of trees conducted to its entrance, and was covered with gravel. I contented my&s;elf with
<PB N="251" REF="030364_0254_0FE5D3D7866FFAD0">
tracing in large characters upon the gravel the word <HI>well!</HI> I &s;et out immediately after, reached the hotel before day break, and went to bed, not to incur any &s;u&s;picion. Every morning, Arzelia left the ca&s;tle, un|der the pretext of a walk, for which &s;he cho&s;e the av|enue, alledging, that &s;he liked it better than the park. There &s;he read what I had written over night, and &s;ometimes made u&s;e of the &s;ame expedient to let me know her thoughts. It was utterly impo&s;&s;ible for her to write, or to find means of conveying letters to me, becau&s;e mi&s;s d'Anfort never left her an in&s;tant. Thus we lived, till the moment when I &s;ent my &s;on to the college of Navarre, where I put him under your care, Mr. Dumont: I &s;aw you; your phy&s;iognomy an|nounced an hone&s;t man, and you have not deceived me!&mdash;It was then that affairs took a different turn at ca&s;tle d'Anfort.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s d'Anfort, who could not conceive how I could live parted from my &s;pou&s;e without &s;eeing her, even without enquiring after her, (for &s;he was ignorant of my nocturnal excur&s;ions) began to let her enjoy more liberty: &s;he changed her lodging, and a&s;&s;igned her another more gay and plea&s;ant, in the front of the fir&s;t yard of the ca&s;tle, quite adjoining to her own. This made my &s;pou&s;e invent a &s;cheme of receiving me by night, unknown to every body. It was a bold &s;tra|tagem; and the more ludicrous, as we made it &s;ucceed. After a written in&s;truction of the intentions of my &s;pou&s;e, which &s;he flung over the walls, I behaved in the following manner.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s d'Antfort u&s;ed to &s;end every day to St. Ger|main, a large covered cart, loaden with the &s;undry productions of her garden. James, the driver, a &s;im|ple, harmle&s;s boor, &s;old them upon the market place, and returned to the ca&s;tle every night at twelve. It came into our mind to make u&s;e of that man to pro|cure our&s;elves without his knowledge, the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with one another, and for that end concerted the&s;e mea&s;ures:</P>
<P>Champaign, my valet, di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf one day as a countryman; he knew the inn at St. Germains, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> put up every night; thither he repairs,
<PB N="252" REF="030364_0255_0FE5D36D928BC1C8">
enters in conver&s;ation with him, propo&s;es a bottle, and makes him boozy. At midnight, James wants to return; I will accompany you, an&s;wers Champaign, for I have now to go a league beyond the ca&s;tle. While they are on the way, the clown leaves the cart a hundred yards behind him. I mount and &s;quat in it. Before the gate of the ca&s;tle, Champaign wi&s;hes his comrad a good night. Will you come this way, in the morning? a&s;ks James. Yes, at four o'clock. Aye, we'll go together to my mi&s;tre&s;s's great kitchen garden, it is not a quarter of a league from here, I take my cart there every morning, I &s;pend the day with the gardener, and in the evening I go to St. Germain, where I get very good cu&s;tomers for the garden &s;tuff. Well, if that's the ca&s;e, we'll meet often, becau&s;e I come this way every day.</P>
<P>Our men part, James conducts his carriage into the yard, unteams his hor&s;es, takes them into the &s;tables, and goes to bed. He is no &s;ooner gone, than a woman makes her appearance, and comes to me in the cart. It is Arzelia! What tran&s;ports! What charming and painful moments! We could only entertain our&s;elves with the tale of our woes. At three in the morning, Arzelia returns to her apartment. James comes back, puts his hor&s;es to the cart, and carries me back as he brought me. Champaign &s;tands waiting for him at the gate: mutual civilities are pa&s;&s;ing; and, drinking is the favorite topic. Whil&s;t they enter a public hou&s;e de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ched from the highway, I jump out of the cart, and run to a neighboring inn, where my tru&s;ty Cham|paign &s;oon comes to join me. We both mount our hor&s;es, and reach the hotel before &s;ix.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t grant, we expo&s;ed our&s;elves much! Well, we carried on the &s;tratagem two whole years, with as much &s;ucce&s;s as on the fir&s;t day. Hone&s;t James even contracted &s;uch an intimacy with Champaign, that he would be &s;orry to have mi&s;&s;ed him a &s;ingle night. This my Alexis is the enigma of the gold repeater, of which I made you a pre&s;ent; and, which I could not explain, without coming to &s;uch illu&s;trations, as nece&s;|&s;ity required us both to avoid.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="030364_0256_0FE5D3DBEE3135E8">
Now, my &s;on, I &s;hall make a digre&s;&s;ion to relate the cata&s;trophe which made me be &s;o barbarous to you; it was the in&s;trument of my pre&s;ent happine&s;s. You &s;hall &s;ee how forcibly maliciou&s;ne&s;s operates upon a feeble heart, at the &s;ame time naturally inclined to &s;u&s;|picion.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon my narration, I ought to par|ticularize the events &s;econdary to it: events which did not reach my knowledge till long after. Count d'Anfort once having a re&s;tle&s;s night, ri&s;es with an in|tent to walk about the premi&s;es; a mere motive of curio&s;ity leads him towards the &s;tables; he is &s;urpri&s;ed to find the door open, and &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed upon entering, to find my own and &s;ervant's hor&s;e mi&s;&s;ing; What is all this? is Cor&s;ange fled? The Count wakes all the dome&s;tics, intimidate them by his threats, and is informed that I leave the hotel every night, and do not return till &s;ix in the morning. The count, who wanted no penetration, &s;u&s;pects me of going to St. Germain, and of having apparently found means to get acce&s;s to my &s;pou&s;e. His indignation is kindled, he calls his &s;on; both mount their hor&s;es, and reach the ca&s;tle about &s;even. They fail not to load Mi&s;s d'Anfort with a thou&s;and reproaches, though the poor lady knew not why. Equally fired with indignation, &s;he promi&s;es to u&s;e all efforts to bring the matter to a di&s;covery. James had often mentioned among the dome&s;tics, his good friend, who went every night with him to St. Germain, treated him with wine, and return|ed each new morn to regale him afre&s;h. Mi&s;s d'An|fort &s;u&s;pected, that this good friend of James, could perhaps be my&s;elf or one of my men. She ordered James an e&s;cort of two tall and &s;tout laborers for the en&s;uing night&mdash;The&s;e have orders to &s;eize James's good friend, and bring him before her. The&s;e orders are executed:&mdash;Champaign is caught, and brought be|fore that old daemon, who knows him at fir&s;t &s;ight. After many threats and offers of reward, &s;he tears from that faithle&s;s valet, a confe&s;&s;ion of our nocturnal interviews:&mdash;&s;he al&s;o inquires for the place where my &s;on was concealed; but Champaign can give no &s;at|isfaction on that part of his examination, becau&s;e, for|tunately
<PB N="254" REF="030364_0257_0FE5D3457055D338">
it is the only thing I have concealed from him. Mi&s;s d'Anfort, in a furious tran&s;port, meditates a cruel revenge, and ea&s;ily prevails upon that &s;ordid wretch to become her accomplice. Oh heaven! why are there &s;ouls &s;o ba&s;e as to become tools to the crim|inal manoeuvres of the great, though ever &s;ure to fall either &s;ooner or later victims of their guilt. This was the lot of Champaign.</P>
<P>Not &s;u&s;pecting their horrid de&s;igns, I arrived at St. Germain at the u&s;ual hour, and was not a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed at finding neither James nor my valet.&mdash;I en|quire without any ceremony, and am informed they went away half an hour before my arrival. Amazed at what could make them be in &s;uch a hurry, I advance to the gate of ca&s;tle d'Anfort, and &s;tand waiting. Half an hour after, out comes Champaign. Ah, &s;ir, &s;aid this wretch, I bring &s;ad news for you! How &s;o? The counte&s;s had me called up by James, and told me this: Go Champaign, go and tell the marquis that I am heartily tired of the &s;lavery in which I am held for his &s;ake. I beg him not to &s;ee me again, and forth|with he need not think of me any more, becau&s;e mis|fortune forces us to part. O heaven!&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible? I wi&s;h to God it were not!&mdash;but, my dear ma&s;ter, to give you a convincing proof, I can &s;how you the pre|&s;ent &s;he made me, to acknowledge, &s;he &s;aid, the trou|ble I had taken. "Here, Champaign," added &s;he, "here is a pur&s;e of twenty-five louis d'ors, rely always on my gratitude; but have nothing more to do with this affair. All is over, I am determined to leave the marquis forever!"</P>
<P>I leave you to think what impre&s;&s;ion this di&s;cour&s;e of Champaign made upon me.&mdash;Far was I from &s;u&s;|&s;pecting his treachery; and, be&s;ides, his report, as to appearances, had too, much the tincture of truth, that I &s;hould have called it into que&s;tion.&mdash;Grief over|whelms me; I break forth in reproaches and impre|cations upon the perfidious Arzelia, and return home with a bleeding heart.</P>
<P>Two days after, I receive, by a &s;ervant of mi&s;s d'An|fort, a billet from my &s;pou&s;e, to the following purport:</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="030364_0258_0FE5D3DE2075DC38">
"All is over, my friend: follow the only rea&s;ona|ble advice I have in my power to give you; it is to fly from me till heaven plea&s;e to di&s;po&s;e matters more favorably."</P>
<P>This laconic billet confirmed me in my fatal opini|on; I imagine that Arzelia, impatient of &s;lavery, would break her chain and renounce me forever!&mdash;What incon&s;tancy!&mdash;what perfidiou&s;ne&s;s! For &s;everal months the&s;e cruel ideas have haunted my fancy, and I got rid of this &s;ituation only to be involved in a more deplorable one! Champaign, (for he was always de|puty) acco&s;ts me one morning, and, with a mo&s;t bod|ing and di&s;mal air, &s;ays: Alas, &s;ir, how will you &s;tand the blow I am going to &s;trike? What blow? Gather all the energy and &s;trength in your &s;oul to hear me!&mdash;Arzelia&mdash;Well, Arzelia&mdash;has proved faithle&s;s to your bed. Faithle&s;s, traitor!&mdash;dare&s;t thou? Yes, &s;ir, your friend Dulys, who is dead, had gained her graces and affections. Villain, tremble! Don't be in a pa&s;&s;ion, my good ma&s;ter! I can prove it, prove it &s;o as to &s;trike you into conviction!&mdash;James, whom I &s;ee every day, and who is now in our intere&s;t and confidence, has found two days ago in the place where Arzelia has been &s;itting, this portrait and this letter, which he &s;aw her ki&s;s &s;everal times.</P>
<P>I was quite cre&s;t fallen, when I really &s;aw the por|trait of Dulys, and at the bottom, the following words, in my wife's own hand writing: <HI>Him I &s;hall never forget!</HI> Gods! What a ray of light &s;trikes the horizon of my under&s;tanding!&mdash;I ha&s;tily peru&s;e the letter, it comes from Dulys him&s;elf; I know his hand!&mdash;What are the contents?</P>
<P>"Take care to conceal the &s;ecret from every eye, mo&s;t worthy and beloved lady!&mdash;Let this offspring of the mo&s;t faithful union, be delivered to me alone.&mdash;Prevent every &s;u&s;picion of the marquis&mdash;his pa&s;&s;ion might be productive of the mo&s;t fatal effects&mdash;indeed, who is intitled more than I to the right of receiving that lovely infant! Farewell, I have given you full in&s;tructions!&mdash;Take care, above all, that nobody di&s;|covers our &s;ecret corre&s;pondence."</P>
<P>An hundred times I re-peru&s;e that fatal letter; I look for expre&s;&s;ions which might de&s;troy my &s;u&s;picion,
<PB N="256" REF="030364_0259_0FE59AFDC8956EF8">
I only find &s;uch as &s;erve to confirm it!&mdash;For, con&s;id|er well!&mdash;was it not a manife&s;t proof of the treachery of Dulys and my &s;pou&s;e? Such a letter, and from my friend's own hand; for his hand it was, and I had well examined it.&mdash;Suddenly, I recollect the &s;peed which Dulys made to reach Be&s;ancon, his zeal in &s;natching the child from my arms, to carry it to Paris, as it were, without my con&s;ent, and to have it chri&s;t|ened and educated there! Add to this, the &s;ilence of my &s;pou&s;e in the convent, and the very letters of my friend, which &s;eemed to have no other tendency, than to alienate my own heart from Arzelia; all this was like &s;o many proofs to corroborate the &s;elf &s;peaking ev|idence before my eyes!&mdash;She never told me, that &s;he had the potrait of Dulys in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,&mdash;All the&s;e reflections made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that I found my affections &s;uddenly detached from my &s;pou&s;e and &s;on. Methinks a veil dropped from mine eyes jealou&s;y fired my weak heart, and I was fooli&s;h enough to go and a&s;k my guardian que&s;tions on that &s;ubject, he having &s;o often railed at me for my con|fidence in Dulys, and the intimacy which I &s;uffered him to keep up with my &s;pou&s;e. The count is a man of &s;ound judgment, &s;aid I; he is incapable of ba&s;e calumny!&mdash;I was upon the point of going up to his apartment, when I &s;aw him come towards me. Pray, what means that kind of a tomb, &s;aid he, which your &s;pou&s;e has erected in a grove of her park?&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter made me remark it:&mdash;What, is Arzelia going mad? How, a tomb? Yes, indeed, one would think &s;he is a widow!&mdash;She &s;pends right and day before it, moaning and uttering the name of Dulys! Yes, Dulys: he was a rare friend, I declare, well may &s;he be &s;orry for him; but, by the bye, &s;he carries her &s;orrow too far.</P>
<P>When the count had &s;aid the&s;e words, I withdraw for fear of hearing more, and my heart wrung with grief; I retire to my apartment, weeping mo&s;t bitter|ly!&mdash;Every thought adds to my de&s;pair. When Ar|zelia &s;poke of Dulys, it was always with &s;uch warmth, with &s;uch animation&mdash;he was the pattern of men, the mo&s;t amiable and mo&s;t perfect of mortals!&mdash;Alexis

owed him his pre&s;ervation, &amp;c. all &s;eemed to evince the po&s;&s;ibility of Arzelia's crime.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, my friends, I formed the barbarous project of getting rid of Alexis, who, on a &s;udden, became odious to me; nothing could move me, neither his &s;trict re&s;emblance of me, which I deemed the effect of hazard, his tenderne&s;s, nor his virtues!&mdash;I &s;ent for Mr. Dumont, to meet me in Luxembourg gardens, and you know the orders, I gave him.</P>
<P>Thus I lived for a con&s;iderable time without &s;eeing my wife, or even without enquiring after her, and, my tyrants, to whom I had owned my having parted with the child, yet, without telling them what had be|come of him, were tolerably &s;atisfied with the appar|ent &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;tratagem, till one day I &s;aw them both come home very much fatigued. We have &s;een him, &s;aid the chevalier to me, his eyes glancing with fiercene&s;s, we have &s;een to day Mr. Dulys' &s;on! Where? In the royal Botanical Garden&mdash;He is very tall! but, brother, as you are &s;o &s;ure that he is not your &s;on, why do you &s;uffer him to be thus in Paris? What is it to me where he is? Very true, but is not he chri&s;tened by your name? he may di&s;cover you &s;ome day, and force you to acknowledge him for your &s;on; put him out of the way, join with us, we will &s;end him to the We&s;t-Indies. To the We&s;t-Indies!&mdash;Never! Whence that blind tenderne&s;s?&mdash;he is either your &s;on, or a &s;tranger's! But &s;ir, what proof have I that he is not my &s;on? Why did you reject him, then? Alas, I don't know&mdash;who will explain me that cruel enigma?</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my friends, I was always wavering between doubt and certainty&mdash;You tremble! you dete&s;t me! well, I de&s;erve it! This circum&s;tance of my hi&s;tory does me no honor: it is my crime, my only crime! it will ever be my torment! Happy if my &s;pou&s;e and &s;on will ever conde&s;cend, if not to forget it, at lea&s;t not to call it to my remembrance?</P>
<P>When I left the count and his &s;on, I perceived they had &s;ome project.&mdash;My tenderne&s;s for Alexis returned and as I never lo&s;t &s;ight of him, I engaged that &s;ame Champaign, that mon&s;ter of a traitor, to carry him a letter and pur&s;e from me. Whether or not Champaign

followed my advice, I know not. Neverthele&s;s, the in&s;tant you left the capital, the count and his &s;on had already got notice, that you was going to Valence. Is it po&s;&s;ible for a man to be thus cruelly deceived?</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the cri&s;is approached which was to de|cide my fate, and re unite Arzelia with her ungrateful &s;pou&s;e!</P>
<P>Long &s;ince, mi&s;s d'Anfort had fo&s;tered a tender in|clination for me. This particular, which I have for|got to mention, has been partly the cau&s;e of all our misfortunes. That vindictive and jealous termagant had declared her pa&s;&s;ion twenty times; and twenty times I treated it with indignation, and contempt. Her pa&s;&s;ion, my di&s;dain, my union with Arzelia, all had rendered her my deadly fiend&mdash;&s;o that &s;he took delight to be our torment, and u&s;ed every effort to bring me to the point where &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>On the evening of the &s;ame day, when you left Pa|ris to go to Valence, I was never more a&s;toni&s;hed than to &s;ee her alight at my hou&s;e! &s;he, who kept my &s;pou&s;e a pri&s;oner in her ca&s;tle; &s;he, in a word, I con|&s;idered as more de&s;picable than her brother and ne|phew. My dear Cor&s;ange, &s;aid &s;he with an air of &s;weetne&s;s, I doubt not you are &s;urpri&s;ed at my vi&s;it; I come to do you &s;ome &s;ervice; only hear me.</P>
<P>I know all; the count and his &s;on have &s;een Alexis in the king's garden; you have ordered him in&s;tantly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uit Paris; he has taken the road to Dauphiny; in &s;hort, I know all; but what you don't know is, that my brother has this very afternoon obtained a <HI>littre de cachet</HI> from the mini&s;ter, to have him taken up with his preceptor for two vagabonds, and as &s;uch they will be &s;ent to the Ba&s;tile&mdash;Heaven!&mdash;Stop, I will &s;ave them, if you chu&s;e. Pray, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w? How, ungrateful man!&mdash;don't you gue&s;s what I mean?

How, madam! They are ju&s;t gone to Valence. But what a barbarity!&mdash;With|out my con&s;ent? Let us not lo&s;e a moment; I have got a po&s;t chai&s;e waiting below.&mdash;Let us join them.&mdash;
<PB N="259" REF="030364_0262_0FE5D3E68D7C1E30">
I have u&s;ed all my endeavors to break their re&s;olution, but to no purpo&s;e. Ah, madam, what concern can you have for a child, which is fully proved not to be my own? Very true; I have forced Arzelia &s;ince to own it;&mdash;but that youth is only unfortunate, and not guilty; ought we to undo him? Madam, I don't go to &s;ave him, but poor Mr. Dumont, his worthy preceptor, who is involved in his mi&s;ery! What, will you &s;uffer him to be carried off? Let him depart, be his fate what it will!&mdash;but that hone&s;t man, who is attached to him much!&mdash;Well, let us &s;et off, my dear; you do well!&mdash;Let them exerci&s;e their rage upon Alexis, and we will &s;ave the hone&s;t man in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>So great was my perplexity, and &s;o importunate mi&s;s d'Anfort, that, without further reflection, I &s;lept in the po&s;t-chai&s;e; mi&s;s d'Anfort places her&s;elf next me, my footman and Champaign mount behind, and the po&s;&s;i|tion whips away. It was but &s;ome time after I per|ceived my companion.&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e, but &s;he an&s;wered me with &s;mooth language, and promi&s;ed to di&s;comfit all their intentions by her bare pre&s;ence, and to &s;ave the innocent Dumont from the hands of our enemies.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved &s;ilence, and &s;ighed all the way. I hope, my friends, you will look with the eye of pity upon my barbarous conduct towards Arzelia and Alexis, and lay the guilt upon the authors of that infernal plot, who have taken the advantage of my weakne&s;s. I &s;hall, therefore, draw a veil over my conduct at Valence, which I hold in horror and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the count and his &s;on had &s;uffered &s;ome delay on their journey; they only reached Valence af|ter me, where, to all appearances, they did not find Alexis. Enraged in the idea of my having &s;aved their victims, they pur&s;ued me in my way to Lyons&mdash;my chai&s;e is overtaken; Champaign who was behind, be|trayed us, and that very in&s;tant I &s;aw my&s;elf &s;urround|ed by a &s;et of hor&s;emen; among others, by the count, his &s;on, and an <HI>Exempt of the Police</HI> with a proper e&s;cort. Traitor, cried I to the chevalier, convinced of his com|ing to carry off Dumont, "Coward! what has that
<PB N="260" REF="030364_0263_0FE5D3D591F7CEC8">
poor gentleman done to thee?&mdash;Alight, I mu&s;t either have thy life, or thou mine!"</P>
<P>That in&s;tant we began a bloody combat, in which I &s;ee my dear Dumont drop. Champaign, who attempt|ed to di&s;arm me, is &s;lain by my hand, and my brother him&s;elf &s;hares his fate&mdash;the cruel chevalier drops down lifele&s;s!&mdash;The <HI>Exempt</HI> and his followers ru&s;h upon me; I am bound, hand cuffed, thrown in my chai&s;e between mi&s;s d'Anfort, who had fainted, and the count, in de&s;|pair, who loaded me with threats. The dead were taken up in ha&s;te, and thrown in the other chai&s;e; but whether from the ob&s;curity of the night, or from ter|ror and con&s;ternation, my poor Dumont was left on the field, the mi&s;take was di&s;covered &s;ome time after; but, upon returning to the fatal &s;pot, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound he had been taken away!</P>
<P>We proceeded to Paris, where I was thrown into an ob&s;cure pri&s;on, and my trial for the wilful murder of the chevalier d'Anfort was &s;oon brought forward. I know not how it would have ended, but that Arzelia, upon receiving the tidings of that fatal cata&s;trophe, went and threw her&s;elf at the king's feet. She gave the monarch an account of our adventures, who was moved, and promi&s;ed to do her ju&s;tice. The count and I actually received orders to appear before his maje&s;ty. Each of us expo&s;ed his own ca&s;e; and that gracious prince, moved to tears, granted me his mercy and par|don. He would not confine his clemency to this only; as &s;overeign, he was mo&s;t graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to order my renunciation to be torn, my marriage legalized, Alexis acknowledged, and, if ever I &s;hould be &s;o for|tunate as to find him, <HI>Louis</HI> enjoined me to pre&s;ent him at court.</P>
<P>Count d'Anfort alone was unhappy; he was exiled to one of his ca&s;tles, his &s;i&s;ter followed him, and we, loaded with royal favors, di&s;patched &s;everal faithful emi&s;&s;aries in &s;earch of Alexis.</P>
<P>How incen&s;ed was I again&s;t my&s;elf for my fatal jea|lou&s;y! That portrait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dear to Arzelia, was only the pledge of her regard and gratitude for all the &s;ervices rendered us by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> faithful friend!

in the convent, was the mere effect of his zeal and del|icacy. Dulys &s;aid, if Cor&s;ange comes to know that he is father, his pa&s;&s;ion, already too violent, will not keep within the bounds which prudence exacts in &s;o cruel a juncture; in con&s;equence, he made provi&s;ion to have Arzelia delivered of Alexis, at the hou&s;e of a fe|male acquaintance, near the convent, from which he had planned her e&s;cape, previous to the birth of my &s;on. In &s;hort, the generous Dulys had done all for me, and I dared to in&s;ult his memory, in accu&s;ing him and my &s;pou&s;e!&mdash;Oh! how often have I blu&s;hed at this crime&mdash;how often have I felt the mo&s;t gnawing remor&s;e!</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>ALEXIS AND THE COTTAGE CHANGE NAMES.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE marquis de Con&s;ange concluded his narra|tive, and all his hearers, who were &s;ingularly moved, began talking in divers ways upon events of &s;o extraordinary a nature. Unfortunate father, &s;aid the generous Dumont, you have been unju&s;t indeed; but how has misfortune &s;oured your temper!&mdash;The wretch &s;u&s;pects every thing; once deceived, he thinks he always will be. The continual habit of &s;orrow irri|tates his nerves, and renders him pa&s;&s;ionate, hard, e|ven dead to feeling! Obliged to be di&s;tru&s;tful again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> every body, he believes every body will hurt him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Such is my point of view, my principles and philo&s;o|phy.</P>
<P><HI>Per lo caro Gie&s;u,</HI> replies Carlo, that philo&s;ophy is good for nothing. Nothing can bid defiance to the machinations of the wicked: prudence in &s;uch ca&s;es frequently draws you into their &s;nares: <HI>certamente,</HI> it is wi&s;er to fly from them entirely, than to avoid them, by watching their motions! You are right, &s;aid the mar|quis; better would it have been for me and my &s;pou&s;e to have fled from our tyrants, and to have left a hou&s;e.&mdash;You could not, <HI>Signor Cor&s;anjo!</HI> You will pardon me, &s;ir, I could have done it very early in the begin|ning. Eh, no, <HI>perche,</HI> you was to &s;uffer all tho&s;e mis|fortunes! it was to be, it was written&mdash;prede&s;tination! Oh, prede&s;tination breaks in Alexis, are you going to begin your non&s;en&s;e, Sciocco? <HI>Pardonate mi, tenero pa|drone:</HI>&mdash;have not you your&s;elf approved of it? How, pur&s;ues the marquis, does Mr. Sciocco think that all that happens to us has been pre&s;cribed? <HI>Si veramente Signor.</HI> Let him run on, father, replies Alexis:&mdash;he will &s;ometimes only talk non&s;en&s;e. His moral dog|mas are very non&s;en&s;ical, my &s;on. Upon that footing there would be no criminals, every body would excu&s;e him&s;elf by prede&s;tination!&mdash;Heavens! what an error!&mdash;have you imbibed tho&s;e prejudices, my Alexis? No, my father, but I entertained others of a different ca&s;t.
<PB N="263" REF="030364_0266_0FE5D3EA67E4C4C0">
Speak, then&punc; give me an account of your adventures from the time you left the cottage.&mdash;You mu&s;t have been concealed in &s;ome dark corner of the globe, be|cau&s;e I had &s;earches made after you throughout the kingdom. I was not concealed, father. Li&s;ten all to me, my dear friends, and you too Clara.&mdash;I will &s;oon cure you of the unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions you had again&s;t me, with regard of my connections with the wife of the gaol|er of St. Marcellin, and Sophia of Mar&s;eilles.</P>
<P>Alexis &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity, and when he had done &s;peaking, the marquis and marchione&s;s embraced him again. They were all &s;atisfied, Duverly and Dorance alone ob&s;erved the profounde&s;t &s;ilence. Du|verly, above all, &s;eemed to be &s;truggling with black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">pair. The narrative of the marquis had &s;tolen ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a tear from his eyes; and Dulys' good faith and genero&s;ity were &s;o many le&s;&s;ons which upbraided him for his pa&s;t crimes: he dared not to look at any one of the company, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h to hide him&s;elf from his own &s;elf. Dorance had pity on him. Unhappy man, &s;aid he, here is thy daughter, dur&s;t thou give her that &s;weet name? Yes, I &s;hall dare, an&s;wers Duverly!&mdash;Yes, I &s;hall give her that precious name; but not before I have avenged thy cau&s;e! Avenged! Yes: &s;oon.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, Duverly draws his &s;word, and goes to thru&s;t it in his body. They all prevent him! Do|rance, Dorance him&s;elf, who had ju&s;t thir&s;ted after his blood, &s;eized the murderer's &s;teel, and flings it far from him. Dorance, what do&s;t thou? My duty, ungrateful friend!&mdash;The misfortunes of the marquis and marchi|one&s;s, my own, nay, experience, the greate&s;t of all teachers, in &s;hort, every thing &s;hows me what pa&s;&s;ions are!&mdash;They made me commit many imprudent actions, and thee they have led to crimes! What &s;ay I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I am more guilty than Duverly: this hand&mdash;my &s;pou&s;e&mdash;my &s;on!&mdash;But I will pardon thee more than my&s;elf: Unite thy Clara with my Alexis; and let Hymen put the &s;eal to our reconciliation.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, and holding forth his hand to Duverly, &s;ees the latter fall precipitately to his feet; he &s;eizes his beneficent hand, be&s;prinkles it with his tears, and utters

<P><HI>O divino &s;pectaclo,</HI> cries the Italian, <HI>O augu&s;tie delle vi|cende humane!</HI> What hand does conduct you!&mdash;What being, great, &s;ublime, and magnanimous, leads thus mortals to happine&s;s upon a &s;tormy &s;ea!

Here, in a brown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with a girdle about my loins, my days will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in tranquility and happine&s;s, and you will come fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> time to time to &s;ee the good hermit&mdash;the travellers will &s;top to &s;ee me.

<P>This &s;ally of Sciocco excited the laugh in every one of the company: but Carlo was like to be angry; when he remembered that laughing was one of the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures of man, and ingrafted by nature: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his fermentation, therefore, &s;ub&s;ided, and he joined in the general joy.</P>
<P>All our heroes were happy; they &s;pent &s;everal days in viewing the different departments of the cottage, and afterwards all &s;et out together for Paris; the good-natured Candor and his old &s;ervant, regardle&s;s of their hoarine&s;s and infirmities, would be of the party. In con&s;equence, all the apartments of the cottage are carefully locked, the draw bridge is &s;ecured, and the journey commenced.</P>
<P>How plea&s;ant was this trip! all was buried in oblivi|on: neither complaints nor reproaches were heard any more! All countenances were &s;erene like all hearts, and the happine&s;s of &s;eeing Alexis pre&s;ented to the king, became the general topic.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="030364_0268_0FE5D3EB2E4886A8">
Arrived in Paris, the marquis and his &s;on repair im|mediately to Ver&s;ailles&mdash;they arrive before the king! Alexis trembling, dares not look up. Is this your &s;on, Cor&s;ange? his maje&s;ty a&s;ked. Sire, it is he! He looks very &s;hy,&mdash;Young man, be good-natured, mode&s;t, di&s;crete, and I will never for&s;ake you! Suppo&s;e we be|gin to give him a regiment; what do you think, mar|quis, we &s;hall &s;ee how he will manage it! Sire, all the blood in his veins is at your maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. He ought to imitate the example of his grand-father, who died in my father's &s;ervice!&mdash;He was a brave com|mander. I have known him my&s;elf, and am not a|&s;hamed to own, that fighting by his &s;ide, I have learn|ed to be a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>The king &s;poke to them for &s;ome time longer with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he mo&s;t conde&s;cending familiarity, and the commi&s;&s;ion of a colonel being made out, and &s;igned for young Cor&s;ange, his maje&s;ty di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, loaded with prai&s;es and benefits.</P>
<P>A few days after, the young colonel and his Clara &s;tept to the altar, and were joined together in holy matrimony! how dear had they purcha&s;ed that hap|pine&s;s! Alas, if it mu&s;t be paid with &s;o many cro&s;&s;es can we envy our mortal lot?</P>
<P>Meanwhile Duverly, always agitated by remor&s;e, fell dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, and &s;oon expired in the arms of his friends, after having begged a thou&s;and pardons of Candor, who regretted him &s;incerely. On his death-bed he made a will, by which he con&s;tituted the colonel and his lady, &s;ole heirs to his con&s;iderable e&s;|tate, which he had much improved in America, where he had been re&s;ident fifteen years. He neither forgot to &s;ettle an annuity upon the good John Picot, whom he bad &s;o unju&s;tly charged with theft, at the Dolphin inn at Lyons. Signor Carlo had al&s;o a &s;hare of his property, for which he failed not giving thanks to Providence, who had &s;o favorably conducted that event.</P>
<P>Candor, al&s;o bent under the &s;uperior weight of age and infirmity, &s;oon after died compo&s;edly, and without a groan: Alexis clo&s;ed his eyes, and bound him&s;elf to execute his la&s;t de&s;ire. The old man had ordered in

his la&s;t moments, his body to be transferred to the cottage, to repo&s;e near the a&s;hes of Adela and his &s;on. Therefore, with the permi&s;&s;ion of the rector, in who&s;e pari&s;h he died, Colonel Cor&s;ange, his lady, their chil|dren and friends proceeded to Grenoble with the remains of their late friend. Upon their arrival, the corp&s;e was depo&s;ited for a while in a cathedral, till proper preparations could be made in the cottage for its reception.</P>
<P>On the day following, thirty workmen were em|ployed to rebuild the cottage: two wings, and another &s;tory were added to it; the windows were made wider, and decorated with balconies. Over the my&s;terious &s;ubterranean they built a chapel, which was &s;oon con|&s;ecrated by the bi&s;hop of Grenoble. The form of the garden was al&s;o changed, but the rivulet, the little bridge, the grove, and the great poplar tree were &s;uf|fered to remain. In &s;hort, the young couple left no|thing unimproved. They &s;urveyed with plea&s;ure and emotion the theatre of their loves and adventures. How &s;weet is the remembrance of the times when we were happy!&mdash;When we &s;ee places that have been dear to us, the heart dilates, and the &s;ight wanders to and fro, with a real &s;en&s;ation of delight!</P>
<P>Thus the little rivulet, the bridge, the grove, and poplar tree, were the only objects not altered in the garden; all the remainder was tran&s;formed into a magnificent park, and the cottage into a &s;umptuous and &s;plendid ca&s;tle. There was but one room in it, left in its original &s;tate. It was the chamber in which Alexis &s;lept the fir&s;t night of his re&s;idence in the cot|tage, and in which he was &s;o much frightened, when he heard the key turn to lock him up, and from here he &s;aw, through the window, funeral rites performed by Candor under the great poplar tree. Clara's hu&s;|band was fond of that room: and ordered his books and mu&s;ical in&s;trumens to be placed in it.</P>
<P>When the in&s;ide was completed, the out&s;ide was al&s;o embelli&s;hed, the draw bridge was pulled down and a new one con&s;tructed, the fo&s;&s;e was bordered with a fine brea&s;t wall, and before the entry to the ca&s;tle, a fine

avenue was opened and prolonged as far as St. Mar|cellin.</P>
<P>So diligent were the &s;earches made in the fore&s;t of Chamboran, that within a month's time, the greate&s;t part of the robbers which infe&s;ted it were apprehended&punc; Several precipices and caverns were filled up with &s;tones and earth. Thus this place once &s;o gloomy, &s;ad, and dangerous, became in a little time a real plea&s;ure-garden.</P>
<P>When all was completed, ready, and in proper or|der, the remains of Candor were placed in the chapel, next to tho&s;e of his unhappy family. The colonel and his lady returned to Paris, leaving the marquis and marchione&s;s at <HI>Ca&s;tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cor&s;ange,</HI> where their pre&s;ence was required by &s;ome additional improvements they de&s;ign|ed to make.</P>
<P>The motives of the colonel's return to Paris were &s;ome regimental concerns: two days after his arrival a man, in a very &s;habby dre&s;s makes his appearance at his hotel; the porter would drive him away, but the &s;tranger in&s;i&s;ts upon an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking to the colonel, and demands immediate admittance. The &s;ervants, tired of his importunate behavior, in|form their ma&s;ter of his ob&s;tinate reque&s;t. The &s;en&s;i|ble Alexis runs quickly down &s;tairs; trained up in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, could he reject the unfortunate!</P>
<P>He acco&s;ts the &s;tranger. Don't your honor know me? a&s;ks the man. No, my friend; yet I recollect to have &s;een you &s;omewhere. Plea&s;e your honour, to recollect well. It is u&s;ele&s;s, I cannot now. Have not you been brought up at the college of Navarre? Yes: Don't you recollect the beggar you one day took into your apartment to explain to you a watch! Oh lord, is it thee, my good fellow? The very &s;ame, an' plea&s;e your honor: I then foretold you what has happened &s;ince, and I dare &s;ay, you remember how I told you, <HI>If you are happy one day, you &s;hall &s;ee me at your door.</HI></P>
<P>Alexis was quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with amazement; he actu|ally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> fortune telle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> who had explained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in &s;o &s;ingular a manner, that now &s;ince the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad been explained to

him, he found the man had told him the truth. Well, good man, how did you come to know the change of my fortune? From the public accounts, an' plea&s;e your honor; your misfortunes and your father's are known to every body, &s;o the report mu&s;t have reached me too. Well, my friend, I am happy, and &s;o &s;halt thou be; yes, thou &s;halt be happy too!</P>
<P>From this moment, Alexis received the poor man in his &s;ervice, and had never rea&s;on to repent it after|wards: the man had been a &s;oldier, &s;ome fooli&s;h trick made him de&s;ert, and he was always &s;orry for it. The colonel obtained his pardon, received him in his own regiment, and made him immediately a quarter-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Alexis would not confine his genero&s;ity and gratitude to tho&s;e only who had obliged him: he received al&s;o Vincent, who had been his man while he was yet at college, among the number of his dome&s;tics. Even young d'Erreville felt the effects of his beneficence. The reader mu&s;t recollect this fellow &s;tudent who introduced Dumont and his pupil to his father, who&s;e &s;ecretary had robbed them in the plains of Belleville. D'Ere|ville had lo&s;t his father. His mother had &s;ince been married to a giddy young blade, who had ruined her, and, that he and his &s;i&s;ter were obliged to live on the fruits of their indu&s;try. D'Ereville was recommended by Alexis, to an excellent place in the ammunition of|fice, and his &s;i&s;ter was married much to her advantage. Alexis ruminated if there was nobody el&s;e whom he might have &s;erved: he forgot nobody, and was cher|i&s;hed by all, but e&s;pecially by his king, who &s;oon rai&s;ed him to the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation.</P>
<P>Clara lived happy, and became mother to many chil|dren. She was as good a mother, as a tender and faithful &s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>The marquis and marchione&s;s lived with their chil|dren to the late&s;t and happie&s;t winter of life.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont, the friend of Alexis, &s;uperintended the educatian of his &s;ons; he had renounced his pre|judices again&s;t mankind, by the habitual intercour&s;e with the upright and virtuous.</P>
<P>As for poor Carlo Sciocco, I am &s;orry to inform my readers he went as mad as a march hare, by &s;ound|ing

too much the metaphy&s;ical &s;traights, and being not &s;atisfied re&s;pecting the equilibrium of things, he would even &s;crutinize their nature, and the laws of the equilibrium. There were moments when he fancied all the &s;aints in paradi&s;e before him, to reveal him, the principle of perfect harmony. Alexis, who was ex|tremely &s;orry to &s;ee him in &s;uch a condition, put him under the care of &s;ome &s;ubaltern officers, paying them a con&s;iderable &s;um to board and maintain him.</P>
<P>John Picot was made keeper of Ca&s;tle Cor&s;ange, where Alexis and his family &s;pent a certain time every &s;ummer; yet, notwith&s;tanding its recent &s;plendor, and magnificence, Alexis and Clara were better plea&s;|ed with walking in the grove, or along the banks of the rivulet; that happy couple would never forget their former re&s;idence in this rural &s;eat, and would al|ways call it their <HI>Cottage in the Woods.</HI></P>
