<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Job II. vii.</HI></BIBL>
<P>So went Satan forth from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and &s;mote <HI>Job</HI> with &s;ore Boils, from the &s;ole of his Foot unto his Crown.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the Enemy of Mankind was fir&s;t permitted to tempt the Faith and Patience of holy <HI>Job,</HI> his E&s;tate and Family only were made liable to his Power, with an expre&s;s Command not to touch his Per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003315_0003_0FF02743804273B8">This I look upon to have been almo&s;t as great a Temptation as the &s;poiling of his Sub|&s;tance, or the &s;laughter of his Children, for|a&s;much as the common Opinion of Man|kind hath u&s;ually e&s;teemed the &s;urvival of a|ny great Misfortune, to be the greater Un|happine&s;s of the two.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch Afflictions 'tis very hard for a Man to moderate his Pa&s;&s;ion; for Grief is natural, and the exce&s;s of it ea&s;ily run into: But to re&s;train and curb it, and not &s;uffer it to exceed its ju&s;t Limits, to feel Sorrow as a Man, and to a&s;&s;wage it from proper Con&s;i|derations as a wi&s;e Man, is a &s;train above Nature, and properly con&s;titutes that pa&s;&s;ive Vertue, which we call <HI>Patience.</HI></P>
<P>Thus our Hero, being plundered of his E|&s;tate, and bereaved of his Children, reduced from Affluence to Beggary, and in danger that his Name, in the pre&s;ent <HI>Generation fa|mous,</HI> &s;hould in the next be <HI>clean put out</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 109. 12.</NOTE> af|ter &s;hewing a ju&s;t Re&s;entment of the&s;e &s;evere Di&s;pen&s;ations, by rending his Clothes, and other his Country Tokens of Di&s;tre&s;s; look|ing up to the Hand that &s;mote him, re&s;olves all into the good Plea&s;ure of that Providence,
<PB N="5" REF="003315_0004_0FF027450A3111E0">
which was about to re&s;ume what it had hi|therto lent; and dutifully re&s;igns what he had thankfully received, and wi&s;ely u&s;ed as a Steward only, without arrogating to him&s;elf the Right of a Proprietor. <HI>Naked,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>came I out of my Mother's Womb, and naked &s;hall I return thither: The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 1. 21.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>The &s;uddain Fall of this great Man may &s;erve to &s;hew us, how unable all human Means are of them&s;elves to &s;upport us, when it &s;hall plea&s;e God to withdraw the Ble&s;&s;ing of his Protection: That we cannot be &s;ecure again&s;t the <HI>Changes and Chances of this Mortal Life,</HI> in any Acqui&s;ition of Power, or Riches, or Reputation, no not in <HI>keeping Innocency,</HI> and <HI>taking heed to the thing that is right,</HI> with|out the Concurrence of Divine Providence: That God many times may afflict without for&s;aking his Servants. And when it &s;hall &s;eem good to him to call us forth, into the rough Paths of Suffering; if He &s;hall plea&s;e to <HI>mini&s;h</HI> and <HI>bring us low</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 107. 39.</NOTE>; the Example of our Text will teach us, not to behave un&s;eem|ly, or <HI>charge God fooli&s;hly</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Job 2. 22.</NOTE>, but with Pa|tience and Meekne&s;s, and Re&s;ignation, and
<PB N="6" REF="003315_0005_0FEFDA0525594398">
Contentedne&s;s, take what <HI>He</HI> lays upon us, who&s;e is the <HI>Kingdom and the Power,</HI> and to whom for that very Rea&s;on we &s;hould give, even in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Attempt of the Devil being thus baffled, and the Sincerity of the Holy Man found to be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon more &s;olid Foun|dations, than what the Accu&s;er had urged to his own, as well as <HI>Job</HI> his Di&s;advantage; he next in&s;inuates that <HI>Job</HI> was a Man of &s;o mean a Spirit, as to be glad of Life upon any Terms; and &s;o prevailing was this Pa&s;&s;ion in him above all other, that it was the on|ly Con&s;ideration that kept him in his Duty to God; for fear of being <HI>cut off from the Land of the Living: Put forth now,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>thine Hand, and touch his Bone, and his Fle&s;h, and he will cur&s;e thee to thy Face</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 2. 5.</NOTE>. That is, afflict him in his Body, let &s;ome painful, &s;ome acute Di&s;temper make his Life burden|&s;ome, without any hope of Recovery, and his Hypocri&s;y will di&s;play it &s;elf, and you will find he will throw off all the Regard he pre|tends to have for God, and will openly arraign and bla&s;pheme his Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003315_0006_0FEFDA0748BFCEA0">Upon this In&s;inuation, the Devil obtains Permi&s;&s;ion a &s;econd Time to try our Man of Fortitude, what Impre&s;&s;ion bodily Pain, and lo&s;s of Health would make upon him, who&s;e Vertue under the Lo&s;&s;es he had lately &s;u&s;|tained, &s;tood &s;till fix'd and impregnable.</P>
<P>Indeed his Malice was limited, and the good Man's Life was to be &s;ecured, but that was more than <HI>Job</HI> knew: So that the <HI>Ad|ver&s;ary</HI> had all the real Advantages again&s;t him, that he could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire.</P>
<P>According to his u&s;ual Way, after being once defeated, he returns to the A&s;&s;ault, with fre&s;h Vigour and additional Strength. Temptations like Waves break in upon us, one upon the neck of another, and commonly the la&s;t is the bigge&s;t, and goes the farthe&s;t. 'Twas hard up|on <HI>Job</HI> to be deprived of his worldly Goods, harder to be bereaved of his Children, hard|e&s;t of all when the&s;e were gone, to be yet wor&s;e handled, buried as it were alive, turn|ed into <HI>Corruption</HI> before his Time, by the In|fliction of a &s;ore noi&s;ome Di&s;temper, which excluded him the Society of Mankind, and even then his <HI>Reputation,</HI> the only <HI>uninfected</HI> thing left, as inhumanly treated as his Body.
<PB N="8" REF="003315_0007_0FF02746F39A9628">
And &s;o we are come to the Words of our Text, <HI>So went Satan forth from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and &s;mote</HI> Job <HI>with &s;ore Boils, from the &s;ole of his Foot unto his Crown.</HI></P>
<P>The Silence of Scripture hath given Inter|preters Occa&s;ion of gue&s;&s;ing at the Di&s;tem|per which the Devil here inflicted upon <HI>Job</HI>: But among them all, it appears not certain|ly what it was. I will therefore de&s;ire to give an Opinion, equally I think true, with any that hath yet been taken Notice of: It is this, That the Devil by &s;ome <HI>venemous Infu&s;ion</HI> into the Body of <HI>Job,</HI> might rai&s;e his Blood to &s;uch a Ferment, as threw out a <HI>Con|fluence</HI> of <HI>inflammatory Pu&s;tules</HI> all over him from Head to Foot: That is, his Di&s;temper might be what is now incident to mo&s;t Men, and perhaps conveyed to him by &s;ome &s;uch Way as that of <HI>Inoculation.</HI></P>
<P>I do not at pre&s;ent &s;ee what can be ad|vanced to invalidate this Suppo&s;ition, which I look upon to be as tenable as any that is extant about this Matter: Having this addi|tional Advantage, that the Scene of Action lies in tho&s;e parts of the World, whence this Practice is <HI>confe&s;&s;edly</HI> derived.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003315_0008_0FF0274ACB53CF90">The Tempter's Aim was &s;till the &s;ame as before; to make his <HI>Patient</HI> let go his Inte|grity, throw off his Dependance upon Al|mighty God, and renounce that Allegiance which is ju&s;tly due to him, as Creator and Governour of the World: To per&s;uade him, that if any thing, he was the wor&s;e for his con&s;tant Obedience to God, who made him &s;o &s;evere Returns for his faithful Services; and &s;o by Con&s;equence, comparing his pa&s;t De&s;erts and pre&s;ent Treatment together, to infer, that God was a <HI>hard Ma&s;ter,</HI> or that he neglected to &s;uperintend human Affairs; on rather to ask <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Que&s;tion, <HI>Who is the Lord</HI>? and &s;o, lay in his Misfortune a Foun|dation for Infidelity.</P>
<P>How in all the&s;e De&s;igns the Devil was di&s;appointed, it may be well worth our Pains to enquire: In order to do this, it is not at all improbable to &s;uppo&s;e that the holy Man might duly con&s;ider the&s;e two Points.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> For what Cau&s;es Di&s;ea&s;es are &s;ent among&s;t Mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Who it is that has the Power of inflicting them.</P>

<P>I take them to be principally two: Either for the Trial of our Faith, or for the Puni&s;h|ment of our Sins.</P>
<P>There is nothing, generally &s;peaking, that a Man is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ignorant of as him&s;elf, nor &s;o apt to be deceived in: His Love and Aver|&s;ion are chiefly complexional, and not &s;o of|ten as they &s;hou'd be grounded upon ratio|nal Motives: I believe I may venture to af|firm, that the Religion of the greate&s;t part of Mankind is perfectly accidental, accor|ding to the Country they happen to be born in: Men carry their religious Profe&s;&s;ion <HI>as the Children of Ephraim</HI> did <HI>Bows</HI> and <HI>Arrows</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 78. 9.</NOTE>, which they knew not how to u&s;e <HI>in the Day of Battle.</HI> The Day of Battle, in a re|ligious Sen&s;e, is, when any Afflictions over|take us, which in the mo&s;t ordinary Way come upon us in <HI>diver&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es and &s;undry kinds of Death.</HI> When God thus plea&s;es to vi|vit a &s;incere Profe&s;&s;or, he marks him out for an Example for the re&s;t of Mankind to imi|tate; He &s;ets him like a lighted Beacon on a

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es are &s;ent, if not for the Trial of our Faith, for the Puni&s;hment of our Sins.</P>
<P>Bad as the World is, it would &s;till be wor&s;e, if the Wickedne&s;s of Mankind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould be &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to meet with no more Rebuke than it would willingly &s;uffer. But Sin, as it is always the de&s;erving, &s;o it is often the procuring Cau&s;e of Afflictions in this Life, as appears from our Saviour's Admonition to the Man in St. <HI>John,</HI> whom he had lately healed; <HI>Sin no more</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>le&s;t a wor&s;e Thing come unto thee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 5. 14.</NOTE>: And he had already been puni&s;hed with a bodily Infirmity thir|ty eight Years together.

For, if as the Scrip|ture a&s;&s;erts, God <HI>doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lam. 3. 33.</NOTE>; that is, afflict Men merely for the &s;ake of correcting them, nor take Plea&s;ure in their Sufferings as &s;uch; it will follow, that to one of our aforemen|tioned Rea&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> either the Trial of our Faith, or Puni&s;hment of our Sins, all his Vi|&s;itations are to be attributed.</P>
<P>Some Sins it plea&s;es God to &s;trike immedi|ately in a more remarkable Manner, as he did <HI>Herod</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts 12. 23.</NOTE>; while others do naturally and by degrees, advance to the Puni&s;hment they de|&s;erve: Thus habitual Drunkenne&s;s and Adul|tery, will ruin Health, and impair E&s;tates, and induce a di&s;tempered old Age as the na|tural Con&s;equence of a riotous youthful one. This al&s;o gives us to con&s;ider, that Di&s;ea&s;es are not only <HI>judicially</HI> inflicted for pa&s;t Of|fences, but graciou&s;ly al&s;o de&s;igned to <HI>pre|vent</HI> future: And a little Recollection will tell a Man, whether he has not often been kept

Virtuous through fear of the Con&s;equences, even when Inclination has gotten the better of his Duty. Hence &s;ome are made Hone&s;t for fear of a <HI>Pri&s;on</HI>; others continue Cha&s;te for fear of <HI>Infection</HI>; a great many are Ju&s;t for fear of <HI>lo&s;ing their Character</HI>; and no doubt &s;e|veral are Religious more out of fear of <HI>going to Hell,</HI> than any thing el&s;e. So that we &s;ee the wor&s;t of evils have their U&s;e, and in this Sen&s;e, and by proper Reflections, we may make a Moral of the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Should all Re&s;traints of this Sort be taken away, were there no fear of Puni&s;hment in this Life, nor belief of any in the next; &s;hould Iniquity and Reputation be join'd together, and Health be Handmaid to Uncleanne&s;s; we may conjecture from pre&s;ent Di&s;orders, how mightily they would encrea&s;e, and irre|moveably be e&s;tabli&s;hed; &s;o that we have good Rea&s;on to ble&s;s and prai&s;e Almighty God for the whole&s;ome Severities ordained for Offenders, without which, the World would be a much more uncomfortable Place to live in, than it is at pre&s;ent. And this brings me to the &s;econd Con&s;ideration, which is,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Who it is that hath the Power of inflicting Di&s;ea&s;es upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003315_0014_0FF0275D88561820">Our Text indeed a&s;cribes <HI>Job</HI>'s Di&s;temper to the Power of the <HI>Devil</HI>; but the foregoing Ver&s;e &s;hews <HI>that Power</HI> to have been deliga|ted to him, and limited by Almighty God, who alone being Omnipotent, the Powers that be, whether <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Political</HI>), mu&s;t all be derived from him. 'Tis true, he has com|municated &s;everal Parts of his Sovereignty to the Sons of Men, but &s;till the Exerci&s;e of it will ultimately be re&s;olved into his Permi&s;|&s;ion. And it is as true, that there are &s;eve|ral Branches of Authority, which he has re|&s;erved to him&s;elf, in di&s;playing of which, he acts upon Prerogative, and without human Intervention. I chu&s;e to In&s;tance in the In|fliction of Di&s;ea&s;es, which I will attempt to prove are utterly unlawful to be inflicted by any who profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. In|deed where the Doctrines of Salvation are not known, and a regular Dependance upon Pro|vidence is po&s;tponed to the ab&s;urd belief of a <HI>Fatality</HI>; there it is no wonder to &s;ee Men give into impious or unrea&s;onable Practices: But in a Country where better Principles are <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> where God's Government of the World is for the mo&s;t Part undi&s;puted, and &s;lavi&s;h implicit Belief happily &s;uper&s;eded by rational Enquiries; in &s;uch a Place, methinks,

Men cannot ea&s;ily be reconciled to a <HI>Practice,</HI> which abu&s;es their <HI>Under&s;tanding,</HI> as well as in&s;ults their <HI>Religion</HI>; and if the received Notions of God's Providence be ju&s;t, has its Foundation in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and mu&s;t be main|tained (if at all) by <HI>Pre&s;umption.</HI></P>
<P>The Holy Scriptures give us frequent In|&s;tances of God's giving Power unto Men to <HI>heal Di&s;ea&s;es</HI>; and by his Ble&s;&s;ing a Power is &s;till continued: But that one was ever grant|ed to <HI>inflict Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> will I think hardly ap|pear; unle&s;s in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with the <HI>Egyptians</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 9. 10.</NOTE>, and <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> with his Servant <HI>Ge|hazi</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 King. 5. 27.</NOTE> But both the&s;e Ca&s;es were miracu|lous, and of God's own immediate Appoint|ment, to vindicate the Honour of his Ser|vants the Prophets, and for the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Sacrilege</HI> and <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and cannot be drawn into Precedent by any not inve&s;ted with the &s;ame Character and Authority. Men may, and have invented Wracks and Tortures for each other, but no Man, let his Crimes be what they will, was ever yet condemned to an immediate Sickne&s;s, or &s;entenced to lie langui&s;hing in a Fever, for want of a &s;uffici|ent Authority, which no body but a pre&s;ent

Set of <HI>adventurous Practitioners</HI> have of late pretended to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily be granted, therefore, that &s;uch a Procedure, for want of a <HI>competent Au|thority,</HI> is unlawful: That if Di&s;ea&s;es, as be|forementioned, are &s;ent unto us for the <HI>Trial of our Faith,</HI> or the <HI>Puni&s;hment of our Sins</HI>; He alone to whom our Faith mu&s;t <HI>approve it</HI> &s;elf, and our <HI>Sins are manife&s;t,</HI> has <HI>properly</HI> the Power of inflicting them.</P>
<P>Remembring then our Text, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to call that a <HI>Diabolical Operation,</HI> which u&s;urps an Authority founded neither in the Laws of <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Religion,</HI> which tends in this Ca&s;e to anticipate and bani&s;h <HI>Providence</HI> out of the World, and promotes the encrea&s;e of Vice and Immorality.</P>
<P>That a modern Practice has a direct ten|dency to all this, I offer the following Con&s;i|derations to evince.</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Phy&s;ical</HI> Power does not always infer a <HI>Moral</HI> one: That is to &s;ay, a Man cannot <HI>lawfully</HI> do every Thing that is in his <HI>Power</HI> to do. Thus we ab&s;tain from Acts of Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, although
