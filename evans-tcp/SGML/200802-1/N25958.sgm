<HEAD>THE HORRORS OF A MONASTERY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the province of Catalonia, which forms the north-we&s;t corner of the kingdom of Spain &s;tood formerly the mona&s;tery of St. Mark,&mdash;(at the commencement of this &s;tory, which was in the 12th century, it is well known what an uni|ver&s;al &s;pirit of depravity and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, per|vaded every &s;acred rank without exception,)&mdash;&s;ituated on a rock which looked into the wide ocean. This retreat, whether at one time the hi&s;&s;ing waters awed, or at another their mirrored &s;urface calmed the brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> into devotion, &s;eemed formed by the hand of nature for the abode of contemplation. On the other &s;ide, the fearful tops of the Pyrenees appeared to penetrate the &s;kies, and brooded over the &s;cene in &s;hapele&s;s grandieur. Rhodolpho was the owner of a large track of territory, which lay in the &s;ame province. His ance&s;tors had inhabited the&s;e for &s;everal ages &s;ignalizing them&s;elves in civil as well as military
<PB N="2" REF="034525_0005_0FFE192B611CB710">
capacities. Rhodolpho fell in one of the la&s;t battles that effected the expul&s;ion of the Moors from Spain, and left behind him an only daugh|ter to &s;ucceed to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The lovely El|mira had ju&s;t completed her 18th year at her fa|ther's death. Her qualifications every way ami|able, had attracted the notice, and won the af|fections of Bernard, only &s;on to the Count of Ar|ragon, a young nobleman equivalent in all re&s;|pects to the preten&s;ions of her merit. She was betrothed to him, and to their union there re|mained no other ob&s;tacle, than the re&s;pect, on her part, due to a father's memory. In con&s;e|quence of this, it &s;eemed proper to her guardi|ans, that a twelve month &s;hould elap&s;e before the con&s;ummation of their nuptials, and that this &s;he &s;hould devote to religious ob&s;ervances for the departed &s;pirit. She was accordingly removed to the mona&s;tery of St. Mark. She had a la&s;t in|terview with her Bernard before &s;he bade a tem|porary adieu to the world, when, after the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations of mutual regard, and after &s;he had pledged her faith to acquaint him if any illne&s;s &s;hould befal her, they took a ten|der farewell of each other. She then retired to the cloi&s;ter, where eleven long months were &s;pent in the &s;ociety <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aints, who&s;e night|ly vigils, tears, ab&s;tinence, and wretched appa|rel, bore every mark of penitence and &s;anctity. Her time pa&s;&s;ed on in a round of melancholy rites by day, and &s;lumbers interrupted by the mid|night bell.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="034525_0006_0FFE192CE63EDCF0">
Bernard, to be near the idol of his heart, had been the lowly inhabitant of a cottage hard by. He u&s;ed to wander in the &s;ilent hour of night a|long the &s;hore, and when a light from above darted its beams upon the &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene a|round him, imagination carried him to the quar|ter from whence it came. He fancied his bride then occupied in the &s;olemn offices of religion, and his &s;oul aro&s;e with her's to the throne of their common Pre&s;erver. In the&s;e nocturnal watchings, he had frequently imagined at the intervals when the waves cea&s;ed to break upon the rocks, that he heard a di&s;tant confu&s;ed &s;ound. &s;imilar to that of revelling. At fir&s;t he thought it might have been &s;ome illu&s;ion of his &s;en&s;es; but at length, when it was frequently repeated, it began to di&s;turb his quiet, and make him think within him&s;elf that all was not right. He wi&s;hed Elmira away from the abbey. He re|que&s;ted acce&s;s to her, but it was denied him. This increa&s;ed his anxiety. As the time, howe|ver, drew nigh, being now but a few weeks di&s;|tant, in which &s;he &s;hould come forth from he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ad re&s;idence, he determined within him&s;elf to wait with patience the fulfilling of it. His con|jectures were right. In Peter, abbot of the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">+vent, beneath the garb of ab&s;tinence and humili|ty, was concealed a wretch of the mo&s;t flagitious nature. He and &s;ome others of the monks, at the dead hour of night, u&s;ed to &s;teal out pri|vately by a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, to a place a|part from the abbey, and there to wa&s;te the hours
<PB N="4" REF="034525_0007_0FFE192FC6B29980">
in debauchery and rioting.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That there were &s;uch rece&s;&s;es in many convents is now completely a&s;certained.</NOTE> But this was not all, Peter was a mon&s;ter capable of more enor|mous actions: in the heat of his intemperance, he had conceived a brutal pa&s;&s;ion for Elmira, and he &s;crupled not to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e by the mo&s;t villainous means.</P>
<P>There was a dungeon in the rece&s;&s;es of the rock on which the Mona&s;tery &s;tood, and to which it was joined by a long and winding vault. This had in former times been a lurking retreat for its owners, the lords of that place, when in times of trouble they were driven to the la&s;t re|&s;ort. Hither then, Peter determined to have her dragged, that he might the more ea&s;ily attain his horrid ends. He imparted his intentions to Francis, a monk as abandoned as him&s;elf, and who had formerly a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in many a black tran&s;action. Little delay was nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;econd night after their plot was laid, they went &s;oftly to Elmira's apartment, and tapped gently upon the door; Elmira was on her knes; cro&s;|&s;ing her&s;elf; &s;he &s;tarted up, and demanded, who knocked? She was an&s;wered by a voice which cried in a low whi&s;per, "Si&s;ter, art thou alone?" Thinking that it was a nun, come to require her attendance at the &s;ick bed of one of the &s;i&s;terhood, &s;he ha&s;tened to admit her when Francis ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly in upon her. With one hand he &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pt her mouth, and with the other pre&s;ented a dag|ger to her brea&s;t threatning to put her to an in|&s;tant
<PB N="5" REF="034525_0008_0FFE1935538FDBB8">
death, if &s;he &s;hould make the &s;malle&s;t di&s;|turbance; Elmira, terrified, &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground.</P>
<P>The inhuman fathers, in&s;tead of &s;uccouring, took an advantage of her illne&s;s, and their fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was, to bind a &s;carf they had prepared, &s;o hard round her face, as to prevent her calling but if &s;he &s;hould recover, on &s;eeing whither they were going to take her. They then carried her along &s;everal galleries, nor met with any oppo&s;i|tion, till they arrived at the &s;ecret door which led into the vault. Here they &s;et her down till one of them &s;hould open it. She had now com|pletely recovered her &s;en&s;es. She attempted re|&s;i&s;tance, but re&s;i&s;tance was in vain. She uttered a &s;aint &s;hriek; but the binding confined the found, and its echo was hardly perceived along the vault through which they were now leading her. They at length came unto the iron gate of the dungeon; it was &s;ecured by a bolt, which was removed, and the unfortunate Elmira pu&s;hed in. She then heard the gate creak upon its hinges, the bolt once more fa&s;tened without; and a while after, the di&s;tant &s;ound of the key turning cautiou&s;ly in the further door, died away upon her ear; and &s;he was left in all the agony of &s;ilent horror. The monks now ha&s;tened to the completion of their infamous plot. They laid along upon the bed of her they had remov|ed, a block of wood, which Francis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad prepa|red, and disfigured, &s;o to repre&s;ent a dead body; with her lamp, yet burning, they &s;et fire to the hangings and bed-cloaths; this they extingui&s;h|ed
<PB N="6" REF="034525_0009_0FFE1936D8B122F0">
when it had half con&s;umed them; the lamp was &s;et at a di&s;tant corner of the apartment, &s;o as to ca&s;t a glimmering light upon the objects in it, and every thing &s;o artfully di&s;po&s;ed, as to give it the appearance as if Elmira had been ac|cidentally &s;corched to death.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters being arranged, Francis &s;pread the alarm. This he did by &s;tating &s;hortly&mdash;That as he and the abbot had been retiring to their chambers, they were &s;truck with the &s;mell of fire;&mdash;that they had traced it to the chamber of El|mira;&mdash;that they had arrived too late to re&s;cue, but had by their exertions prevented the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from &s;preading any further.</P>
<P>They lady abbe&s;s and &s;everal of the &s;i&s;ters came forth to the apartment, but the thick &s;moke which yet hung round it, and the two monks re|maining clo&s;e at the bed-&s;ide, prevented them from approaching near enough, or di&s;covering the deception. "Hope is at an end," &s;aid the wicked abbot, "her pul&s;e has cea&s;ed to beat, and her &s;pirit has &s;ought the man&s;ions of the ble&s;t. Let me entreat you all then to retire. All aid is now fruitle&s;s. On the morrow at noon let us all here re-a&s;&s;emble, and the bell &s;hall then toll to the &s;ad ceremony of her interment. Fa|ther Francis and my&s;elf &s;hall watch all the night, and put up our prayers for the &s;aint that is gone. Once more then retire." Elmira had been beloved in the convent. Her melancholy end was bewailed by the &s;i&s;terhood, and they all &s;adly and &s;lowly retired to their re&s;pective cells,
<PB N="7" REF="034525_0010_0FFE19385E19EAD8">
with eyes that were &s;treaming in unfeigned tears. When all was quiet, Francis conveyed a coffin from his chamber, in which they laid the ficti|tious body, and nailing it down, they &s;lipt &s;oftly out to the di&s;tant retreat &s;et apart for their revel|ling. There they &s;aw the morning hours come round in wine and merriment, with as little un|concern as if nothing unu&s;ual had happened. At the appointed hour every inhabitant of the abbey a&s;&s;embled to the doleful bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. Vir|tue is re&s;pected, even by tho&s;e that are mo&s;t lo&s;t to it; and the early fate of the beautiful Elmira, melted alike the upright and the abandoned, and wrung &s;ympathy indi&s;criminately from the pious and the profligate.</P>
<P>After the prayers for the decea&s;ed were fi|ni&s;hed, the bier was rai&s;ed from the ground on the &s;houlders of eight friars, and the proce&s;|&s;ion began in &s;low &s;olemnity. Fir&s;t went &s;ix monks, each carrying a flambeaux in his hand; then the lady abbe&s;s, followed by her nuns, two and two, with black vails drawn over their faces; next moved the coffin, covered with a cloth; and the wicked Peter, attended by the other brothers came la&s;t of all. They marched in deep &s;ilence till they arrived at the chapel, when the organ &s;welled an anthem, which the nuns &s;ang as they went along; and for &s;ome time after the mu&s;ic had &s;topped, the &s;ound rolled along the arches above till it was lo&s;t in repetition. They now reached the ai&s;le, where they depo&s;ited the body; and after &s;inging a requiem to the interred re|mains of Elmira, returned to the chapel, where
<PB N="8" REF="034525_0011_0FFE193CB40E6A80">
divine &s;ervice employed them the remainder of the day; &s;ervice in which the abbot and his accom|plice joined in all the ferver of apparent enthu|&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>The impri&s;oned Elmira had pa&s;&s;ed the hours in melancholy conjecture, and trembling anxiety, that &s;ome &s;till more dreadful calamity awaited her. She feared, from the manner in which this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad befallen her, &s;he was at the mercy of two &s;a|vage fathers, who might harra&s;s, might &s;tarve, might murder her. No help was nigh. She was far from the &s;ound of mortal &s;tep. Her Bernard&mdash;. Fancy never carried her that way, but her &s;treaming eyes confe&s;&s;ed what a wretch|ed pro&s;pect was before her. Thus was &s;pent a night and day, which the impenetrable darkne&s;s prevented her from counting; and her gloomy &s;olitude made her imagination lengthen. At mid-night, Peter, with a little water in a flag|gon he had hung round his neck, and a &s;canty allowance of the coar&s;e&s;t bread, repaired to the dungeon. A lamp which he held in his hand di&s;covered to Elmira the rece&s;&s;es of her dark&s;ome pri&s;on. She could ca&s;t her eyes along &s;everal rows of arches, built of thick &s;tones, down which the damps trickled on the &s;ides. Beneath her feet was the cold and &s;olid rock. Near the iron gate, which was the only entrance to it, was a little round aperture, cro&s;&s;ed with two bars of iron; this &s;erved to tran&s;mit the little circulation of air which breathed along the vault. At the other &s;ide of this aperture &s;he perceived her hood|ed per&s;ecutor. The lamp ca&s;t its pale rays upon
<PB N="9" REF="034525_0012_0FFE193E379C38A8">
his haggard countenance, and &s;howed his eye|balls, which intemperance had reddened and &s;unk in their &s;ockets, rolling in pa&s;&s;ion. Stretch|ing out his withered hand, he &s;et down the bread and water within the iron bars. Then, in a &s;of|tened tone, addre&s;&s;ed the wretched Elmira.&mdash;"Thou wilt doubtle&s;s wonder, &s;i&s;ter, at the &s;eem|ingly cruel, and unaccountable manner in which thou ha&s;t been conveyed hither. But lend an ear a few moments to my defence, and I tru&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e will &s;ub&s;ide into pity. Preamble then is needle&s;s. Fair Elmira, I love thee. Con&s;ent to my wi&s;hes, and thou &s;halt be in&s;tantly removed to a place where plea&s;ure &s;hall court thee in eve|ry varied form.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the&s;e ages of &s;acred profligacy, tho&s;e monks, in a &s;ociety who were devoted to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, had concealed retreats at a di&s;tance from the mona&s;tery, whether they re|&s;orted, and gave them&s;elves up to every &s;pecies of volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s.</NOTE></P>
<P>Till this time to-morrow thou &s;halt have to re|flect on it:&mdash;If, then, thou &s;halt prove ob&s;tinate, and &s;purn me, wo be unto thee. Meantime be a&s;&s;ured, that all hopes of e&s;cape are vain.&mdash;Thy dirge was this day chanted, by weeping virgins, and thy &s;uppo&s;ed body laid low in the ground. Let no fal&s;e expectation then elate thee. Here is wherewithal to &s;u&s;tain nature. This &s;hall to-mor|row be renewed to thee&mdash;Farewell!"</P>
<P>Having &s;aid the&s;e words, he retired, leaving Elmira in a &s;tate of mind not to be de&s;cribed. A&s;toni&s;hment, fear, contempt, grief, and de&s;|pair,
<PB N="10" REF="034525_0013_0FFE19427A42DB20">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her by turns, or rather, tore her brea&s;t together; and the hours glided on, in an agony, that no one was nigh, to pity or to &s;often.</P>
<P>The accounts of Elmira's death had now &s;pread beyond the mona&s;tery, and at length reached the cottage of Bernard. He hurried in frenzy to the abbe, and found the mournful report was too true For a while at fir&s;t, he raved in wild|ne&s;s. "Barbarians," he wou'd cry, "where have ye taking her? Wherefore did I not get on&mdash;one look of her, before the cold ground receiv|ed her? Scorched and disfigured as &s;he was, her remains would, to me, have &s;till been lovely; her delicate features, though the prey of the de|vouring flames, to me,&mdash;to me, would have &s;till retained all their former &s;ymmetry."</P>
<P>The&s;e emotions were too violent to be la&s;ting. They &s;oon abated, into a &s;ilent, &s;ettled, melan|choly; and Bernard knew, that the only object was gone, that could give the world to &s;mile upon him. Determined to for&s;ake it, to live and die in that &s;pot, where &s;he, in whom his every wi&s;h, his every hope, had centered, had lived, and di|ed before him. This de&s;ign, he communicated to the monks; and next day, with the u&s;ual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o|emnities, he was admitted into their order.</P>
<P>During the foregoing night, Peter had as u&s;u|al, de&s;cended to the dungeon, with the food of Elmira. Setting it down, he called her by her name; he was an&s;wered by a deep fetched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="11" REF="034525_0014_0FFE194557CDB830">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was continued along the vault. "Ha&s;t thou," &s;aid he, "been pondering on my words? Beauteous Elmira, what an&s;wer &s;hall I expect? &s;peak, I am all patience." "Peace wretch!" re|plied Elmira, "nor add to my &s;ufferings by thy horrid importunities. To one &s;o far &s;unk in the aby&s;s of vice, to aim to drag the innocent be&s;ide thee;&mdash;&s;o abandoned to impiety, as to imagine all around thee, equally unprincipled with thy|&s;elf. Integrity almo&s;t forbids reply&mdash;Begone, then, and di&s;quiet me no more. Away; I defy thy utmo&s;t malice."</P>
<P>The virtue and dignity of Elmira &s;tuck a mo|mentary awe into that brea&s;t, which had long, till that in&s;tant, been a &s;tranger to every finer feeling Muttering cur&s;es within him&s;elf, he &s;lowly departed, nor pre&s;umed the har&s;h reply, which at another time his corrupt heart would have gloried in.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now &s;uppo&s;e him, for &s;everal en&s;uing nights, &s;tealing out with Elmira's &s;u&s;tenance. She continued as inflexible as before, and Peter, though determined upon taking &s;ome &s;tep, as yet he&s;itated what that &s;tep &s;hould be.</P>
<P>It happened once, that walking acro&s;s her pri|&s;on, &s;he treaded on &s;omething hard, that was de|tached from the pavement. She took it up, and at night, when the abbot came, by the light of his lamp &s;he ca&s;t her eyes with horror on a &s;kull. This inflicted on her a deeper &s;hock than any thing &s;he had yet undergone. But to &s;peak her fears could &s;erve no purpo&s;e, and &s;he was accord|ingly
<PB N="12" REF="034525_0015_0FFE1946DDBD9238">
con&s;traind to &s;ilence. This appearance will be explained in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>One night, when &s;tillne&s;s reigned thro' all the convent, one of the monks, who&s;e name was Henrique, &s;oftly opened the latchet of Bernard's door, who&s;e griefs kept him waking, "Bernard," &s;aid he, advancing. "I have &s;omewhat of impor|tance to communicate; but, if now you &s;eek the pillow of repo&s;e, we will defer our conference to another occa&s;ion." "Alas!" &s;aid Bernard, "there is no repo&s;e for me. Sir, I be&s;eech you, &s;it, and proceed: I am well-rivetted in attention." "Let us not, then, wa&s;te our moments," an&s;wered Henrique, "fir&s;t, then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> abbot of this place is a fiend unfit for the &s;ociety of even the wor&s;t of men. "Peter! nay &s;tart not, the &s;ame;&mdash;I have re&s;ided within the&s;e walls five long years, and I could rehear&s;e &s;uch things as would freeze thy blood in &s;ilent horror&mdash;would &s;well thy brea&s;t in fierce&s;t indignation. The nightly rioting which thou mu&s;t already have been invited to partake of, is the &s;malle&s;t of his offences. If thou would&s;t know to what extent his guile can &s;tretch,&mdash;fly&mdash;fly this place. He and his accomplice, Fran|cis, &s;eek your life." "I will believe, and yet, alas! what cau&s;e have I given them&mdash;what is it &s;hould tempt them to &s;o wonton&mdash;&s;o unprovoked an outrage?" "The an&s;wer to that is &s;hort and ea&s;y," interrupted Henrique, "they have two motives to gain by your de&s;truction. Fir&s;t, &s;e|cretly di&s;patching you, they will give out, that you have died a natural death. This they will do in the hope that your father, having no other heir, will, in a mi&s;taken devotion, bequeathe his
<PB N="13" REF="034525_0016_0FFE194C5E700DA0">
lands to that mona&s;tery which contains the body of his &s;on. In the &s;econd place, given altoge|ther to licentiou&s;ne&s;s them&s;elves, can you not &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary it is for them to be rid of one, who may detect, and at length di&s;clo&s;e their ways. I would not have e&s;caped &s;o long, did I not &s;ome|times &s;eem to give into their intemperance, that I might one day have an opportunity of bring|ing them fully to light. That opportunity has now arrived; I have heard of thy virtues Bernard, before thou did&s;t relinqui&s;h that world, they once did honour to; and &s;ince I &s;aw thee, I have marked them, and &s;atisfied my&s;elf. Thou art, as yet, untainted with the manners of this place, thou art, as yet, a man whom I can tru&s;t.

Oh! my friend, the&s;e words have &s;truck deep into my &s;oul, Elmira, Elmira, thus have they done with thee:&mdash;Oh! cruel that they were.

have violated, I &s;wear there is not a peril I will not encounter, to &s;ift the records of this &s;cene of blood&s;hed to the bottom."</P>
<P>"There are here then," re&s;umed Henrique, "&s;ome di&s;tant concealed places, which we mu&s;t fir&s;t di&s;cover. My apartment is in the farthe&s;t end of &s;everal galleries, and in a remote part of the convent. At different times, &s;ince I fir&s;t came hither, I have heard low noi&s;es at mid|night, like the locking of doors. I never could di&s;cover what they meant exactly, or the pre|ci&s;e part whence they proceeded. I once hinted it in pre&s;ence of Peter, who&s;e countenance was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly and vi&s;ibly altered, to a livid palene&s;s. He in vain endeavored to conceal his emotion from me. I did not, however, then &s;eem to notice it, nor broached the &s;ubject a|gain, le&s;t I &s;hould give him cau&s;e to perceive my &s;u&s;picions, when a further and a &s;tricter conceal|ment on his part, might prevent detection upon mine. Some little time ago, in the middle of the night, I heard a di&s;tant noi&s;e of two per&s;ons &s;truggling, from one of them I di&s;tinctly per|ceived a faint &s;cream, and pre&s;ently the locking of the door I had formerly ob&s;erved."</P>
<P>"Ah!" exclaimed Bernard, "it is too true. It was, it was Elmira."</P>
<P>"There is a woman here in di&s;tre&s;s," re&s;um|ed Henrique, "I am &s;ure of it, and now is the time to re&s;cue her. Through a chink, I ye&s;ter|day remarked the abbot and his partner in ear|ne&s;t

conver&s;ation. It was then I marked, a|mong other broken &s;entences, the&s;e words: "What &s;hall we do with her," cried one. "Let her &s;tarve," replied the other. "Ha! &s;aye&s;t thou," cried Bernard in extreme agitation, while a thou&s;and thoughts flu&s;hed a|cro&s;s his brain; "what then is to be done?" "Put off your &s;hoes," &s;aid Henrique, "give me that lamp, and follow me." They now went without the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e to the cell of Henrique.</P>
<P>Henrique and Bernard were going to proceed in their &s;earch, when the former quickly extin|gui&s;hed the lamp, and laying hold on Bernard's arm, "Stand," &s;aid he &s;oftly, "I hear a noi&s;e." A light &s;truck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cro&s;s the gallery, and in a little time after, they &s;ew Peter glide before the cell without ob&s;erving them. In a few minutes they heard a door opened. Henrique in&s;tantly ven|tured out, and went as &s;wiftly as caution would allow him, to the place whence he gue&s;&s;ed the noi&s;e came. He applied his ear clo&s;e to the wall. He heard the &s;ound of foot&s;teps, which reverbe|rated along the vault. He called on Bernard, who joined him. "Remain here," &s;aid he, "till I go and follow him."</P>
<P>He groped for the door, which he found at length half open. He went forward along &s;eve|ral pa&s;&s;ages, and down three or four flight of &s;tairs, till he at la&s;t came to a turn of the vault, where he perceived the beam of rays from Pe|ter's light; he judged it prudent to go no farther.
<PB N="16" REF="034525_0019_0FFE19524ADA3A90">
He awaited the breaking of the &s;ilence, with a beating heart. At length he heard the abbot be|gin with the&s;e words: "Mo&s;t wayward of wo|men &s;till to reject thy happine&s;s; but it is well, and thou ha&s;t rou&s;ed my vengeance,&mdash;prepare thy&s;elf. Three days longer thou &s;halt have to deliberate. If thy re&s;olve be &s;till the &s;ame, the next morning, Elmira, thou &s;halt die."</P>
<P>Henrique had now learned enough. He hur|ried back to his friend. They re&s;ought the cell of the former. There they remained till the abbot returned, locked the door of the vault, and mea&s;ured back his &s;teps till they were lo&s;t in &s;ilence. Henrique now repeated to Bernard the words he had heard. Bernard in&s;i&s;ted upon in|&s;tantly awaking the monks; but was prevailed by the other to re&s;train his motions, and reflect how &s;trong a party they had to contend a|gain&s;t.</P>
<P>"Here," added he, "I have procured &s;ome cords; tying the&s;e together, we can let our&s;elves down from the window, and tru&s;t to Providence to guide us &s;afely down the rocks. We may, then, ea&s;ily procure hor&s;es, and be to-morrow early at the ca&s;tle of the Count your father. There we will &s;peedily a&s;&s;emble as many va&s;&s;als as will &s;erve our purpo&s;e, and the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e &s;hall give us &s;trength to force our march back to the mona&s;tery, ere the time expire for Elmira's de&s;truction."

The full moon &s;hone forth in all her &s;plendor, not a breath of wind glided along the &s;tillne&s;s of the waters, and the moon-beams &s;porting on their bo&s;om, di&s;played all nature arrayed in &s;able ma|je&s;ty. After a little &s;earch, they &s;ound a de&s;cent &s;loped more gradually than the others, this they attempted, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other, arrived at length upon the &s;hore.

Something whi&s;pered within his brea&s;t that he &s;hould &s;ee Elmira no more; but to re|turn was now impo&s;&s;ible. They, therefore, bent their way to the cottage where Bernard u&s;ed to re&s;ide. Having awaked the faithful pea&s;ant who was the owner of it, they were furni&s;hed by him with hor&s;es. They made him promi&s;e to have the neighborhood a&s;&s;embled on the &s;econd night, that they all might join in their cau&s;e, for the&s;e were attached to Benard while he dwelt a|mong them, and their hone&s;t hearts would prompt them to &s;hew their gratitude, by ri&s;quing their lives for him.</P>
<P>After a little refre&s;hment, which the cottager brought out to them, and being provided by him with money, they &s;et out full &s;peed; they had to travel the whole breadth of Catalonia. They ex|pected to meet fre&s;h hor&s;es in the way, which they did not de&s;pair of, as the Saracens had left in every part of Spain their breed of Arabian cour&s;ers, which were the fine&s;t in the world. They flew then &s;wiftly along a beautiful valley at the foot of the Pyrenees, where nature had

lavi&s;hed her bounties on the plain. The &s;till moon rode above, and pointed out their way with her &s;ilver lamp.</P>
<P>The bea&s;ts of the field, the fowls of the air, the very elements were hu&s;hed in repo&s;e. No &s;ound was heard but the clattering of their hor&s;es hoofs.</P>
<P>The poor animals had now exhau&s;ted their la&s;t remains of &s;trength. Bernard, who knew every bit of the road, &s;eeing a light at a little di&s;tance from it, &s;aid, it came from the ca&s;tle of a friend of his, and di&s;mounting, went quickly on, reque&s;ting Henrique to follow with the hor|&s;es. Bernard rouzed a &s;ervant, who knowing him, in&s;tantly procured him the be&s;t hor&s;es in the &s;table. Henrique did not make his appearance, but the time was too precious to be &s;pent in &s;eek|ing him. Bernard &s;et out alone, charging the &s;ervant that if his friend &s;hould arrive, his ma&s;|ter &s;hould receive him. He now proceeded with incredible velocity, being better mounted than before.</P>
<P>The purple &s;treaks along the heavens proclaim|ed the break of day. The mi&s;ts were gradually di&s;per&s;ing. The birds began to chirp their greet|ing to the opening dawn, and at length the &s;un bur&s;t from the horizon behind him, and poured a &s;tream of glory on the world. La&s;t of all, the pea&s;ants came forth to their daily toil, and began to lead their cattle to the brook. Bernard in|quired of one of them, how far it was to the ca&s;|tle

of Arragon, and found he had as yet but a little more than half completed his journey. He exchanged hor&s;es with the pea&s;ants as he went along, making up to them with money the di&s;|proportion, where there was any, and he at length arrived two hours before noon at his fa|ther's hou&s;e, which &s;tood upon the ea&s;tern fron|tiers of the province.</P>
<P>He briefly told his errand to the Count, who gave in&s;tant orders, that an hundred hor&s;e &s;hould a&s;&s;emble in the court with all precipitation. Meanwhile, Bernard was prevailed on to retire to re&s;t.</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf on a couch, but the agita|tion he laboured under made &s;leep a &s;tranger to his eyelids.

An hundred fiery &s;teeds, &s;norting in the height of blood, bounded together from their con|fines, and ru&s;hed impetuous o'er the plain.&mdash;Their angry hoofs di&s;dain the ground they paw; and, rapid as the whirlwind's progre&s;s, they quickly vani&s;hed from the &s;training &s;ight. They pur&s;ued their road, till the &s;hade of night de&s;|cending, and the exhau&s;ted &s;pirits of their hor&s;es, warned them to &s;eek &s;ome place of &s;helter. This they found in the ca&s;tle where Bernard had the former night obtained the relief he wanted, but lo&s;t the partner of his way. Here they remained for the night, but could get no intelligence of Henrique. Conjecture was fruitle&s;s, and &s;earch was delay. In the morning then, early refre&s;h|ed with new vigour, they re&s;umed their route, nor halted till they arrived within &s;ight of St. Mark's. Here they were joined by the pea&s;ants collected by the faithful cottager, who gave them the following information:&mdash;That the Abbot, fearing, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, the de&s;ign of the fu|gitives, had obtained, from a tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at a little di&s;tance, an armed force to defend his cau&s;e.

<P>This &s;tatement was a true one, and Peter ob|&s;erving, from the walls of the convent, the com|parative fewne&s;s of his adver&s;aries, and con&s;ider|ing that, after &s;o long a march, he might now take advantage of their being feeble and fati|gued, judged that he would be the mo&s;t politic

&s;tep, to &s;end out his fre&s;h troops immediately up|on them, in order to cut them off before they gathered new &s;trength either in men or in &s;pirits. This he did accordingly, and the gates being thrown open, Bernard perceived, with anxiety, a long train of di&s;ciplined forces, march out, and advancing towards him. He was now however forced into an engagement. Drawing up his men therefore on the advantageous &s;tation, he fir&s;t ad|dre&s;&s;ed them in a &s;hort &s;peech; he &s;tated &s;hortly the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, from which they might rely on having on their &s;ide the avenging hand of Heaven, which they could tru&s;t would exert it&s;elf to the de&s;truction of impiety. His little line was formed by &s;etting the pea&s;ants in the middle, with fifty of his own hor&s;emen on each &s;ide. He thought by this &s;tratagem, that if the enemy &s;hould fall upon the weake&s;t part, the o|thers might inclo&s;e, and thus gain the advantage over them.</P>
<P>After giving them directions &s;o to do, he took his po&s;t at the right end, and they all waited the coming up of their opponents in a &s;ilent expecta|tion. The&s;e at la&s;t arrived, and the on&s;et began. Both parties ran furiou&s;ly on each other, &s;words cla&s;hing on &s;words, clouds of du&s;t ari&s;ing up on high, the hi&s;&s;ing of javelins, the impetuous plunging of hor&s;es who&s;e eye-balls were red with fury, and who da&s;hed out beneath their feet the brains of fallen heroes; clamours of exultation, mingled with the groans of expiring wretches, pre&s;ented a &s;cene of ruin and of horror.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="034525_0025_0FFE1964D204D6B8">
Bernard was wading in blood through the thicke&s;t of the fight. Love and vengeance arm|ed him with Herculean &s;trength, and he &s;pread terror and de&s;truction wherever he went. At fir&s;t, the troops of Peter a&s;toni&s;hed, yielded to the fiercne&s;s of the attack; rallying, however, the overpowered him with their numbers, fell on his men, now weary and worn out, and obliged them to retire in every direction. They were now reduced to the la&s;t extremity, and in a &s;hort time would have all inevitably peri&s;hed, had not the attention of both parties been arre&s;ted by a troop of hor&s;emen who were advancing rapidly towards them. The arm of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aughter was &s;u&s;|pended for a moment, and they &s;tood both anxi|ou&s;ly awaiting the i&s;&s;ue. The&s;e galloped into the middle between the two contending bands, and after looking earne&s;tly fir&s;t on the one, and then on the other, they fell with violence on the troops of Peter, whom they routed with a great carnage, and were left entire ma&s;ters of the field.</P>
<P>Bernard and their leader now ran into each o|ther's arms. It was Henrique. Having lo&s;t his way on the night that Bernard left him, he wan|dered onward unknowing where he was till the morning, when he was directed to the very town whence the troops were obtained for the defence of St. Mark. This was a con&s;iderable way off, and he arrived in it but a few hours af|ter the troops had &s;et out for the mona&s;tery.

of men from a neighbouring garri&s;on were called in. The&s;e he headed, and with the&s;e it was he re&s;cued the &s;inking &s;oldiers of his friend. They now found that their lo&s;s had been incon&s;i|derable, and they entered the mona&s;tery with a &s;hout of victory.</P>
<P>A &s;hout of victory! Ah! little thought they how &s;oon it &s;hould be changed into woe unparal|leled, and wretchedne&s;s irremediable.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now relate what happened to Elmira, after the departure of Bernard and Henrique. Peter and Francis finding, or at lea&s;t fearing they were di&s;covered re&s;olved to vi&s;it Elmira no more, but to leave her to &s;tarve where &s;he was already confined. The damps of the cavern had fallen on her tender limbs unu&s;ed to hard&s;hip; a chillne&s;s ran thro' her veins, and &s;he felt that her latter end was approaching; her &s;canty provi&s;ion was gone, and the hard-hearted Peter had never renewed it. Overwhelmed with &s;ick|ne&s;s, and hunger, and de&s;pair, &s;he fell upon the flinty pavement, &s;he put up a prayer for forgive|ne&s;s to her per&s;ecutors, for ble&s;&s;ings on her Ber|nard, then &s;tretching her body at full length, a mi&s;t gathered upon her heavy eyes, &s;he heaved a deep &s;igh, and all the re&s;t was oblivion.</P>
<P>Bernard, as &s;oon as he entered the mona&s;tery, ordered the abbot and his partner to be &s;ecured and put in chains. He then took a key from the brea&s;t of the former, which opened to the entrace of the dungeon, and &s;eazing a taper he had or|dered to be brought, he ru&s;hed to the relief of
<PB N="24" REF="034525_0027_0FFE19694C253508">
Elmira. Before he unbarred the iron gate, he called on her by name; a cold &s;hivering &s;eized on every joint: with a tremulous voice he called again; but not the &s;malle&s;t &s;tir was heard within, &s;ave the mournful echo of his own-words. He bur&s;t open the gate, and entering, beheld Elmira on the bare ground, pale and lifele&s;s. In agony he &s;unk be&s;ide her, and lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s for &s;ome moments; then &s;tarting up, he flew to the apart|ment where the two monks were guarded, He upbraided them in the language of di&s;traction. Mon&s;ters, murderers, was it not enough to be|tray, to per&s;ecute, to murder, helple&s;s innocence; but your callous brea&s;ts could &s;ee her pine in fa|mined mi&s;ery. But let me not wa&s;te the time in words, which is the due of vengeance and of ju&s;|tice; drag them in&s;tantly, my &s;oldiers, hence; away with them, and follow me.</P>
<P>Bernard, now, and one half of his followers, proceeded to the capital town of the province, leading Peter and Francis bound in chains, amid the hootings and execrations of a concour&s;e of people. Its judges were in court. They de|manded an immediate trial. The dark annals of the mona&s;tery in many a former year were reveal|ed. Multitudes of witne&s;&s;es appeared, not only from thence, but al&s;o from the adjacent county, who, with many empty coffins, brought from the ai&s;le of the chapel, bloody in&s;truments of death from the cell of Francis, and &s;culls and other bones from the dungeon, all con&s;pired to accu&s;e and to convict them. The guilt was evident, and they were condemned to die on the morrow.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="034525_0028_0FFE196ED3A39680">
Bernard pa&s;&s;ed a &s;leeple&s;s, joyle&s;s night; at &s;ome moments he would &s;tart up, &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e wildly round him, and rave in all the madne&s;s of de&s;|pair.

The bu&s;tle which had lately buoyed up his &s;pirits, had &s;ub&s;ided in melancholy; and he now had nothing left but death to wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Next day, many thou&s;ands were collected to behold the execution of Peter and Francis. The &s;caffold on which they were to &s;uffer was hung with black, and erected on a plain behind the town. Thither the train proceeded. Before, marched a troop of the &s;oldiers of the place, to &s;low martial mu&s;ic, trailing their &s;pears along the ground. The coffins of the monks followed, mounted on carriages, and drawn by hor&s;es. Se|veral of the prie&s;ts of the town came next, in their pontifical robes. Then the Abbot and Fran|cis guarded by &s;oldiers, with their hands tied behind them, their feet bare, and labels on their backs declaring their crimes; they were follow|ed by men carrying &s;culls and daggers from the abbey. Chief magi&s;trates and officers of the town were next in order, and Bernard, at the head of his hor&s;emen, brought up the rear.</P>
<P>The monks, hardened in iniquity, had deter|mined to brave their fate to the la&s;t. They con|&s;idered, that as Elmira was now no more, little inquiry would be made concerning the manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="26" REF="034525_0029_0FFE1970596480E8">
the death; they therefore denied this, and every other accu&s;ation again&s;t them, as a con&s;piracy to effect their ruin. They per&s;i&s;ted in the a&s;&s;ertion that Elmira had been burnt to death, and prepar|ed to meet their fate with this lie upon their lips.</P>
<P>Bernard, who&s;e head had hung all the while in de&s;ponding angui&s;h, rai&s;ed it in won|der, that &s;uch depravity exi&s;ted upon earth. At that moment Henrique appeared on the &s;caf|fold, leading in an object which attracted every eye: "'Tis &s;he, 'tis &s;he her&s;elf," exclaimed the tran&s;ported Bernard, and cla&s;ped the living Elmira to his heart. The effort was too much; he fell back in an exce&s;s of joy in the arms of Henrique. The violence of his pa&s;&s;ion &s;oon aba|ted, and recovering, he led his charming bride from the &s;cene of execution.</P>
<P>Henrique had carried her from the cavern gent|ly in his arms, and laid her on a bed, where he di&s;covered &s;ome &s;igns of returning breath; the&s;e, with care, he fo&s;tered, and gradually re&s;tored her to life and joy. Anxiety to meet her Ber|nard gave her &s;trength, and feeble as &s;he was, &s;he ventured forth to join him.</P>
<P>Shame now overwhelmed the abbot and the companion of his infamy. Seeing them&s;elves de|tected, they confe&s;&s;ed every thing, and di&s;clo&s;ed a catalogue of enormities they had been guilty of too long, and too &s;hocking to &s;uffer relation. Elmira had prevailed with Bernard to intreat a remi&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t an alleviation of their &s;entence;
<PB N="27" REF="034525_0030_0FFE1971DFA09E60">
but their offences were now too general, and too glaring to be forgiven; their gloomy &s;ouls did not dare to rai&s;e a thought to heaven; they laid their heads upon the block amid the cur&s;es of the populace, and they died impeninent and unpitied. They found in their la&s;t moments, that no hypo|cri&s;y, however artful, can long conceal a wicked heart; and that the perpetrators of guilt are, in the days of their utmo&s;t affluence, de&s;pi&s;ed, and in tho&s;e of their utmo&s;t need, de&s;erted by all, e|ven by their accomplices.</P>
<P>Bernard now prepared to &s;et out with Elmira for the ca&s;tle of his father. He be&s;eeched his friend to accompany him; but this Henrique de|clined, a&s;&s;uring him, that he &s;hould be ever near|e&s;t to his heart, but that it was long &s;ince he had learned to mortify, within his brea&s;t, all de|&s;ire of ta&s;ting the plea&s;ures of this &s;cene of uncer|tainty; that his only wi&s;h was now to retire to &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, where he might dedicate the remainder of his days to heavenly contempla|tion. Bernard accordingly obtained for him that place which the impious Peter had di&s;graced, and he was accordingly elected to the abbacy of St. Mark.</P>
<P>The nuptials of the happy lovers were now &s;o|lemnized with every mark of joy.

<HEAD>THE HEIRESS OF DEVON.</HEAD>
<P>EDGAR, the Sovereign of England, was brave, generous, and humane; but nature, as if to prevent the portrait from being too per|fect, flung into his compo&s;ition pride, rancour and revenge.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which in their blo&s;&s;om might by &s;elf-exertions, the admonitions of the worthy, or the prevalence of a good education, have been checked, were now by neglect &s;prung to a bane|ful luxuriance, and ca&s;t a dark &s;hade around him.</P>
<P>While the wi&s;e &s;aw from many acts of his vir|tues what might have been expected from him; they al&s;o beheld from the oppo&s;ite extremes of his character the &s;ad infirmities of human nature. Humbled by the conviction, the arrogance of &s;elf|boa&s;ted &s;trength was vani&s;hed, and pro&s;trate with pious awe they ca&s;t the be&s;eeching eye to that power who&s;e hand could alone wipe away the &s;tig|ma of error, and who with benignant mercy
<PB N="30" REF="034525_0033_0FFE197BE837A398">
could alone uphold the &s;inking heart, and &s;ave it from the contamination of illicit pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>Virtue and vice thus blended in his di&s;po&s;ition, and each bounding each, prevented his being beloved or di&s;pi&s;ed. The latent influence of vir|tue ca&s;t a varni&s;h over the enormities of vice; he was therefore obeyed, but it was without re&s;pect; accu&s;ed, but without malice.</P>
<P>Mi&s;guided by a &s;uper&s;titious and enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;et, who tarni&s;hed the religion they profe&s;&s;ed, he appeared as an implement in their hands to execute the mo&s;t flagrant exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>To be the &s;courge of iniquity, the rewarder of virtue, the guardian of his people, the patron of every polite and beneficent art, had no charms for Edgar.</P>
<P>Reflection never &s;tepped in to bear him up a|gain&s;t the tide of corruption; his hands never wreathed the laurel to twine around the brow of &s;teady rectitude; he &s;educed innocence from its path, and &s;tung the &s;oul of gentlene&s;s with per|fidy and woe.</P>
<P>Edgar's every feature marked the impetuo&s;ity of his pa&s;&s;ions; his eyes darted forth the fire of youth; his hardy cheek was crim&s;oned with the glow of con&s;cious maje&s;ty; his per&s;on was ele|gant, &s;triking, and in&s;inuating; his air was &s;uf|ficient to announce his rank, he moved as if words were at his command, and &s;poke as if they
<PB N="31" REF="034525_0034_0FFE197EC2A4A2C0">
were to pay him homage; the refinement of lux|ury, the duplicity of an hypocrite, and the &s;o|phi&s;try of a courtier, rendered him &s;killful in eve|ry &s;pecious wile; he was, in &s;hort, in his form, exqui&s;itely lovely, and in tho&s;e hours when de&s;ir|ous to plea&s;e, his manners were irre&s;i&s;table.</P>
<P>Had he united to tho&s;e accompli&s;hments the wi&s;h of doing right, he would have been adored. The brave intrepid generous nature of Britons would have paid him that heart-felt homage which power can never exact; from the bright promi&s;e of his youth they would have anticipated the maturity of years, and beheld him gliding down the vale of time encircled with honour, veneration and gratitude.</P>
<P>The latitude he gave to the vices of the monks was returned by their extenuating his, and while he commited acts marked by the names of profli|gacy and &s;acrilege, declared him worthy to be enrolled among&s;t the martyrs celebrated with re|nown, and to be canonized as a &s;aint.</P>
<P>The innocent and the coquette were alternate|ly his prey; beauty for him never &s;pread her net in vain, and the court was a &s;cene of depravity.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of his male favourites was Ethelwald, a noble Baron, now in the meri|dian of his manhood. Nature &s;eemed to have formed him in her faire&s;t mould. He had happi|ly e&s;caped the total corro&s;ion of vice; but mi&s;led by cu&s;tom, and bribed by &s;elf-intre&s;t, he often
<PB N="32" REF="034525_0035_0FFE1981A10F70A0">
joined in the revels of the night, and mixed a|mong&s;t the bachanalian crew of Edgar, flatter|ing tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which he &s;ecretly beheld with dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>He appeared equally formed to ornament a court, to command with ardour and &s;ucc&s;s in the battle, or join with fleetne&s;s in the rapid chace; his manners were cultivated to refinement; his &s;oul had that intrepidity which led him into dan|ger, yet there was that gentlene&s;s in his di&s;po|&s;ition which rendered him &s;edulous to diffu&s;e peace and benevolence on all within his reach.</P>
<P>His nerves were &s;trung with ela&s;ticity, the fire of his eyes was tempered by lambent beams of gentlene&s;s, his &s;un-burned cheek was tinged with the peach's bloom, and like his royal ma&s;ter he was ever &s;ucce&s;sful in the field of love.</P>
<P>But the beauties of the court now no longer plea&s;ed them, for at this period love &s;welled the wings of fame, and wa&s;ted to the ears of Edgar the charms and accompli&s;hments of the Earl of Devon's daughter, the lovely Elfrida.</P>
<P>She was unknown to the &s;ons of riot and daugh|ters of di&s;&s;ipation; beneath her father's roof &s;he attainad the utmo&s;t elegance, and bloomed and flouri&s;hed encompa&s;&s;ed within his woods.</P>
<P>Edgar prone to variety, fickle as the winds, and ever eager in pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, panted to behold this fair being, and per&s;onally know whe|ther
<PB N="33" REF="034525_0036_0FFE1985D6736FC0">
&s;he merited tho&s;e encomiums, bordering on extravagance, which were lavi&s;hed on her.</P>
<P>He no longer revelled in delight, his ear re|ceived the loud uproar of mirth with di&s;gu&s;t, the banquet was unreli&s;hed by him. After indulging his thoughts a few days, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the crow|ded levee, and taking Elthelwald with him, re|tired to his clo&s;et where he unbo&s;omed his &s;oul:&mdash;"I burn, I die," &s;aid he, "to behold the fair Elfrida, I am a &s;tranger to re&s;t, my &s;oul is occupied with unde&s;cribable emotions, imagina|tion, &s;electing all the loveline&s;s of the &s;pecies, centers it in one object, and pre&s;ents it continu|ally to my views as if to tantalize my wi&s;hes. Even in my &s;lumbers &s;o much is my mind ob&s;or|bed with the idea of her cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s, that the image of an angel hovers around my couch.&mdash;Should I my&s;elf go to try whether fame has exaggerated her charms, or whether &s;uch a ma&s;ter-piece of nature really exi&s;ts, I might perhaps be di&s;ap|pointed in my expectations, and experience that ridicule which points its envenomed &s;hafts even again&s;t the monarch's peace.&mdash;Her rank, her family, render a connection with her even to me not unde&s;irable.&mdash;Do thou then, my friend, my faithful Ethelwald, repair privately to the Earl of Devon's ca&s;tle and behold whether di&s;cription has adhered to truth, and whether Elfrida is for|med to ble&s;s the arms of her &s;overeign, and with brighter lu&s;tre gild his crown."</P>
<P>Ethelwald's heart beat high at the confidence repo&s;ed in him by the King; he immediately pre|pared
<PB N="34" REF="034525_0037_0FFE19875C345E10">
for his excur&s;ion, and the next morning was de&s;tined for it.</P>
<P>Ere morning had unlocked the gates of light, Ethelwald, with a few cho&s;en dome&s;tics, private|ly left the court.</P>
<P>They travelled with &s;uch expedition, that the &s;econd day the awful woods of Devon appeared in view; its lofty turrets, with its towering and ivy-covered &s;pires, from rich amphitheatres of woods, the ca&s;tle ro&s;e in con&s;picuous maje&s;ty; the &s;ublimity of ancient grandeur, and the elegance of a more refined architecture, were di&s;played in it; the dark foliage of the trees was contra&s;ted by the light green of pa&s;tures and &s;hrubberies, among&s;t which were &s;cattered &s;hade grottos, and arborous rece&s;&s;es; rivers here wantoned in divi|&s;ious meanders; here &s;treams ru&s;hed down the &s;craggy &s;ides of mountains, their impetuous fall came with hoar&s;e murmurs to the ear, while cal|mer by degrees they flowed in tranquil currents along the woody vale.</P>
<P>Ethelwald made his dome&s;tics &s;top near the Abbey of&mdash;, where they were to find &s;helter for the night, while he proceeded on his emba&s;&s;y with one faithful &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The &s;ky was now &s;haded by the clouds of even|ing&mdash;the birds were warbling their clo&s;ing lays&mdash;the pea&s;ant whi&s;tled o'er the way to his peaceful cottage&mdash;the flocks faintly lowed as they repo&s;ed under various &s;hades&mdash;the fore&s;ts ru&s;tled to the

<P>But every bu&s;y &s;ound that fluctuated on the gale &s;oon died away, and Ethelwald, in pa&s;&s;ing through a glin, found the ca&s;tle and the cots hid from his view by the ob&s;curity of woods. Not a noi&s;e di&s;turbed the profound &s;ilence, &s;ave one &s;olemn knell from a neighbouring abbey, calling the monks to the ori&s;ons; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon the heart of Ethelwald, the remon&s;trance of who&s;e imagination accorded with all a round him.</P>
<P>He &s;topped the career of his cour&s;er, the reins wore gentley &s;lacked, and &s;udden awfulne&s;s took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul; he gazed, admired, and meditated on the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Rai&s;ing his eyes he at length exclaimed: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Almighty Being, hail; Equally &s;ublime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mild &s;plendour of evening, as in the blazing re|fulgence of the morning.&mdash;Oh Being, benevo|lent and wi&s;e, how prodigal have been thy fa|vours to this capacious globe; where'er the eye turns it witne&s;&s;es a profu&s;ion of ble&s;&s;ings.&mdash;Why will the wayward heart of man repine for the luxuries of art, while nature like a kind parent pours forth every gift that can conduce to health or temperate plea&s;ure.

<P>And &s;hall I, &s;aid Ethelwald, blu&s;hing as he a&s;ked his heart the que&s;tion, &s;hall I (&s;en&s;ible of the truth of what I have &s;aid) be again &s;educed to the vortex of a court&mdash;&s;hall I.</P>
<P>As he &s;poke his &s;tred climbed a gentle a&s;cent, and Ethelwald found him&s;elf at the gates of the ca&s;tle; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ounded the &s;u&s;pended horn, and its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the turr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">.</P>
<P>The porter immediately appeared to enquire who came at that late hour; two travellers, Ethel|wald replied, a&s;tray on their way and &s;eeking a &s;helter from the damps of the night.</P>
<P>Courte&s;y pre&s;ided with a benignant &s;way in the Earl of Devon's brea&s;t, and his dome&s;tics <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ere taught from him to feel, an exqui&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> plea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> in &s;oothing the &s;tranger's woe, and cheering, with the cup of ho&s;pitality, the wearied traveller.</P>
<P>The gates were in&s;tantly flung open; the mien, the habit of Earthwald announced him of a no|ble rank, and the &s;ervants conducted him to a magnificent hall gilded with varied lamps, where at a &s;plendid banquet the family were a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="034525_0040_0FFE199151F67708">
The Earl of Devon had now attained the cen|ter of the vale of years, but it was that green old-age which nature be&s;tows on the children of temperance; like the hardy ever-green he bloom|ed in the winter of his day, health pre&s;erved her glow upon his cheek, his limbs retained their ela&s;ticity, and his eyes beamed with the lu&s;tre which expre&s;&s;ed the feelings of his &s;oul. His noble dame, to all the &s;oftne&s;s of the matron united the dignity of illu&s;trious de&s;cent, and the complacency of benevolence.</P>
<P>Ethelwald apologi&s;ed for his intru&s;ion. The Earl interrupted him: Welcome cried he, to our ho&s;pitable, roof, and thrice welcome the chance which conducted you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it.</P>
<P>The baron was placed in a chair near Lady Devon, who &s;miled with the benignancy of po|litene&s;s and ho&s;pitality upon him.</P>
<P>The heart of Ethelwald panted as he rai&s;ed his eyes to look for Elfrida.</P>
<P>Three young ladies were &s;itting at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but all &s;o equally and &s;o exqui&s;itely lovely, that Ethelwald was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment.

<P><PB N="38" REF="034525_0041_0FFE1992D75A8400">
Harmony, pre&s;iding at the repa&s;t, encrea&s;ed its plea&s;ures, and diffu&s;ed &s;ocial and &s;weet content around. The Earl and his noble Lady in&s;i&s;ted on retiring early, from con&s;ideration of their gue&s;t who&s;e fatigued frame required the refre&s;h|ment of bal&s;amic &s;leep.

The Baron early awoke, and aro&s;e. Aurora now looked down benign on the children of this world, and &s;hed her &s;weete&s;t influence upon it at once to regale every &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Ethelwald from his window viewed an exten|&s;ive and beautiful demen&s;e, and longing to par|take of the &s;weets of morning, he opened a little door in his chamber which led him into a clo&s;et, that by another door, with a gentle de&s;cent of &s;teps, conducted him into a &s;haded and &s;loping avenue.</P>
<P>The flowers glowing in the prime of beauty diffu&s;ed their choice&s;t odours, the birds, flitting form bough to bough, &s;welled their little throats with re&s;pon&s;ible warblings; while at periods he di&s;tingui&s;hed the rude yet harmle&s;s whi&s;tle of the pea&s;ants: perceiving through many brakes and opening, in a &s;urrounding grove &s;ome of them driving their lowing flocks to pa&s;ture, or others tilling that earth from which they were to &s;up|port a fond and helple&s;s blooming progeny.</P>
<P>Ethelwald walked on, for all was new and en|chanting to him; art, that wretched imitator of what is perfect, had long ca&s;t his mi&s;ts before his &s;en&s;es, the delu&s;ions were now vani&s;hing, and he wor&s;hiped Nature the hand-maid of the creation.</P>

delight and energy to the &s;oul; every gale is re|fre&s;hing, every &s;pot &s;trikes with beauty, and e|very bough is alive with the melody of nature. As he &s;poke, he found him&s;elf at the termination of the avenue, in a valley encompa&s;&s;ed with woods of an awful and maje&s;tic appearance. This he immediately concluded was the peculiar &s;pot the Earl and his family cho&s;e for the &s;cenes of recreation, as pavillions were &s;cattered around, intermixed with arbours of &s;weet and clu&s;tering &s;hrubs.

<P>She realized all tho&s;e ideas of beauty which Ethelwald had before painted to his imagi|nation; the charms he beheld la&s;t night with tran&s;port were now faded or only di&s;cerned in the back &s;hade.

Here in the &s;ilence of night forgotten thoughts began to obtrude; the active powers &s;o delight|fully called forth were &s;inking into calmne&s;s, and he recollected the occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it to the ca&s;|tle of Devon.</P>
<P>Oh Edgar, cried he, with a voice wildly di&s;|turbed, into what a &s;ituation have you thrown me; this is a trial indeed, could you not have fore&s;een if beautiful as pictured, Elfrida could not be viewed by the fire of youth, the &s;en&s;ibility of a feeling mind, without danger?

<P>A &s;udden &s;en&s;ation &s;eemed at length to rou&s;e him; he &s;tarted up, tran&s;ports gleaming from his eyes; they were however quickly &s;ucceeded by a profound gloom.</P>

<P>The night waned apace; he ha&s;tily undre&s;&s;ed and flung him&s;elf into bed; he &s;lept, but his &s;lumbers were di&s;turbed by an incon&s;i&s;tent fancy, he wandered through wilds haunted by &s;pectres; fit emblems of every woe which tortures man; he now beheld Elfrida in his view, he &s;trained her to his panting brea&s;t, anon &s;he was torn from him and encircled in Edgar's arms.</P>
<P>He &s;tarted from his pillow, and cold dew broke upon his cheek&mdash;Vi&s;ions of night, cried he, how you torture me; Edgar, by my hopes of felicity, I cannot relinqui&s;h Elfrida to you.</P>

<P>The Earl cho&s;e Ethelwald Elfrida's knight for the day; he a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to mount; the proud &s;teed neighed and pawed, and appeared as from in|&s;tinct to know the trea&s;ure he carried. Her long tre&s;&s;es e&s;caping from the artle&s;s enclo&s;ure of a ribbon, waved with a &s;oft motion of the breeze; her heightened colour gave greater lu&s;tre to her eyes.

A &s;udden whirl in the water fright|ened (or at lea&s;t had the appearance of doing &s;o) Elfrida; &s;he caught the Baron&mdash;what throbbing emotions ru&s;hed upon his heart from the faint pre&s;&s;ure of her hand. His dark eyes beaming on her &s;eemed to &s;wear eternal love and loyalty to her.</P>
<P>A grotto, in the centre of the i&s;land, was their rece&s;s; here dome&s;tics habited as re|clu&s;es greeted their entrance, and a white flag which &s;erved for a table di&s;played their &s;tore, much fitter indeed for the palace of luxury than the cell of a dervi&s;e; but being &s;erved in a pecu|liar &s;tile made tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions which were de|&s;ired.

The flitting birds, by glad&s;ome notes, appeared declaring their joy for &s;uch a retirement; &s;oft mu&s;ic &s;tealing along the water completed the delights that were here a&s;&s;em|bled.</P>
<P>All is enchantment, exclaimed Ethelwald, with an involuntary air of amazement&mdash;yes, ye gay &s;cenes, ye &s;miling beings, my a&s;toni&s;hed mind regards you as the beautiful prodigies of creation.&mdash;Why, oh (continued he with a more &s;erious air) not &s;ooner known? my pa&s;t life appears like a blank, 'tis only now exi&s;tence opens upon me.</P>

Ethelwald was unable to attend to him; he was di&s;tracted by conflicts, the la&s;ticity of his &s;oul &s;eemed to him&s;elf for ever broken; he long|ed for the midnight hour of privacy and &s;ilence. His fame, his honour, &s;tood upon a precipice, and he wanted re&s;olution to pre&s;erve them; his love for Elfrida was pa&s;&s;ion in exce&s;s; a pa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;ed by the apparent ob&s;tacles between them; hurried on by its impetuo&s;ity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e recoiled from the voice of rea&s;on. Genero&s;ity, the early and hitherto con&s;tant inhabitant of his &s;oul, was bani&s;hed by the impul&s;e of &s;elf-gratification; he forgot his obligations; Edgar was no longer re|garded as an indulgent ma&s;ter, but one who would blight his happine&s;s.

<P>He now began to do as all tho&s;e who err, to call on &s;ophi&s;try and &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s to palliate his crime; he repre&s;ented to him&s;elf the incon&s;tancy of Edgar's di&s;po&s;ition, which was too habitual to &s;uppo&s;e would be conquered even by Elfrida; knowing this, cried he, &s;hall I not endeavour to &s;ave her from de&s;truction, from the mi&s;ery her gentle &s;oul would feel when neglected by the mo&s;t changeable of mankind.

of him, too glorious a prize to be aban|doned by a &s;ubjected de&s;irous of aggrandi&s;ement. In every other re&s;pect I vow the mo&s;t inviolable fidelity to him; my tale believed, each ob&s;tacle is removed. There is a language in Elfrida's eyes&mdash;the Baron blu&s;hed with rapture at the thought which flatters hope&mdash;her parents anticipate her wi&s;hes: with me &s;he has nothing to dread from the in&s;tability of love, or the capriciou&s;ne&s;s of my di&s;po&s;ition. In my ca&s;tle &s;he &s;hall enjoy all tho&s;e dome&s;tic plea&s;ures &s;he has experienced from her infancy. Our children will bloom like the young &s;hrubs of the fore&s;t beneath the &s;helter of parental indulgence.</P>
<P>Ethelwald now panted to execute his project; be&s;ides, he knew the impatient monarch, ill brook|ing a delay, might di&s;patch a courier after him, and another courier the Baron &s;aid might be more faithful than me.</P>
<P>By the declining beams of the next day's &s;un he determined on departing; when he declared his intention, he watched Elfrida as he &s;poke; her cheeks were over&s;pread with palene&s;s, her eyes turned to the ground, &s;he &s;eized the fir&s;t op|portunity of retiring in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Noble Ethelwald, exclaimed the Earl, my dame and I will often reque&s;t the repetition of your vi&s;it; ye be a&s;&s;ured we will never encroach on your politene&s;s by urging your &s;tay longer that is agreeable to you; no, believe me, I think a

retreat like this would be too inglorious for you now in the zenith of youth and its active powers.

<P>Ethelwald's grateful heart dictated a thou&s;and things for the urbanity of his entertainments; but its fullne&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed him, and his lips quivered vainly to &s;peak. There are moments when &s;ilence is mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of what we feel.</P>
<P>He &s;ought Elfrida; &s;he was in a &s;eque&s;tered bower in the garden, whither his eyes had traced her from an arched window.</P>
<P>Pardon, lady, &s;aid he, my intru&s;ion, but I come to bid adieu. Elfrida looked, (an uncon|cerned &s;pectator would have imagined &s;he had a con&s;cious knowledge of &s;omething particular he was about to &s;ay) &s;he interrupted him, mention|ed he&s;itatingly the pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>There is now but one pro&s;pect, replied the Ba|ron, &s;miling, I can view with plea&s;ure. Yes, Elfrida, he exclaimed, throwing off the &s;tudied formality of his air, there is but one lovely work in the creation I now regard with tran&s;port. The Earl and his lady &s;olicit me to repeat my vi&s;it, but I dare not without thy permi&s;&s;ion; &s;ay &s;hall I again be welcome, or will you give me cau&s;e to rue your father's ho&s;pitality.</P>

She blu&s;hed, &s;he looked round, &s;he looked down; her eyes met the ardent ones of Ethelwald; Baron, at length, exclaimed &s;he with a glowing ingenuity, if you return, you &s;hall find Elfrida, like her parents, can di&s;tingui&s;h merit.

<P>The moment arrived for his departure; he &s;ighed adieu to the ca&s;tle of Devon; his &s;teed though &s;wift beyond idea, kept no bounds to his impatience; he at length reached the palace, and gained an in&s;tantaneous interview with Edgar.</P>
<P>That monarch, who&s;e &s;triking characteri&s;tic was being carried away in an impetuous pur&s;uit after whatever obtruded it&s;elf on his fancy, had, &s;ince the idea of an union with the Heire&s;s of Devon, pictured an angel to him; no reli&s;h for any amu&s;ement, and he experienced an uncon|querable la&s;&s;itude 'till the period of Ethelwald's arrival.</P>
<P>Well, my Baron, cried he, his tongue falter|ing through an exce&s;s of impatience, has fame been ju&s;t, is &s;he more or is &s;he le&s;s than we expect.</P>
<P>Edgar &s;tammered&mdash;he felt all the &s;hame and a|gonies of di&s;&s;imulation but he could not retreat from the intended &s;cheme, without the re&s;igna|tion of Elfrida; yet mo&s;t gladly did he &s;creen his eyes under the dark plumage of his helmet

Edgar expre&s;&s;ed his mortification by a &s;ul|len &s;ilence of a con&s;iderable duration. Never, cried he, &s;hall I believe the babbling non&s;en&s;e of a few individuals, who probably never beheld her they de&s;cribed a prodigy.</P>
<P>Ethelwald, fearful of exciting &s;u&s;picion po&s;t|poned the moment of declaring his intention of wedding her. Almo&s;t trembling with anxiety, he at length divulged his purpo&s;e, and intreat the &s;anction of his &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Edgar remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;uch an union; he mentioned many of illu&s;trious de&s;cent, of &s;plen|did fortunes, with appearance far more plea&s;ing than that which Ethelwald had painted Elfrida, who might be happy to accept his hand.</P>
<P>The Baron pleaded the capriciou&s;ne&s;s of their choice, the uncertainty of his being the object, above all the favourable &s;entiments of the family of Devon owing their origin to the kindne&s;s graciou&s;ly &s;hewn to me by you my royal ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Since thus re&s;olved, replied Edgar, you have our free permi&s;&s;ion to unite at plea&s;ure your de&s;|tiny to that of the hou&s;e of Devon; from our protection expect every emolument; thy worth, thy valour, merit this return; thou wilt not, Ethelwald, be ever le&s;s acceptable for wanting a

<P>Kneeling in his chamber, he imprecated de&s;|truction on his head if ever again he violated that faith due to a &s;overeign, who unbending from the height and haughtine&s;s of power, conde|&s;cended to him with the familiarity of a friend. Speedily did he trace the road leading to the re|gion of his happine&s;s. He &s;topped at the abbey, from whence he viewed the &s;pires and battlements of Devon ca&s;tle. He di&s;patched a courier for it with a letter declaring all his wi&s;hes. He reck|oned the moments for his return; the diary told him they were of the accu&s;tomed length, but he counted by the throbbings of an impa&s;&s;ioned heart.

Elfrida's angui&s;h &s;urpa&s;&s;ed de&s;cription. Ethel|wald &s;trove not to controul its tumults; the voice of nature he knew mu&s;t fir&s;t be heard; he con|&s;igned her to the melioration of time, her good &s;en&s;e and religion. When her mind began to regain &s;ome degree of its wonted calmne&s;s, &s;he wept upon the Baron's brea&s;t&mdash;now, &s;pou&s;e of my affections, &s;he exclaimed, thou art the only guardian left Elfrida.

<P>Time now rolled on and fond Ethelwald &s;till fa&s;cinated to the confines of his ca&s;tle; he for|got what the departed Earl had &s;aid of his be|ing now in the zenith of his youth and its ac|tive powers, when tho&s;e laurels are to be acquir|ed who&s;e bright foliage &s;hall &s;hade the ebbing period of mortals exi&s;tence.

Even love it&s;elf was hurt by &s;uch a con|duct.

The king at fir&s;t was &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;eclu&s;ion of his favourite&mdash;he felt hurt&mdash;he enquired, and heard too much. In the fir&s;t paroxi&s;ms of rage and di&s;appointment, he vowed by the &s;pirit of offended loyalty to puni&s;h the perfidy of Ethel|wald. Even in his cooler moments, he was &s;till determined. After &s;ome little deliberation he di&s;patched a courier to inform the Baron he pro|po&s;ed taking the amu&s;ement of the chace in the fore&s;t of Harwood, and would pa&s;s a few days at his ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>'Twas now the &s;torm bur&s;t tremendous on his head; he &s;huddered, he experienced the dire horrors of an illicit plot; he beheld the gulph of de&s;truction yawning before him, and &s;aw no re|treat. He fled to the apartment of the Barone&s;s&mdash;he caught her to his bo&s;ome&mdash;he even wept over her&mdash;he &s;aw the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing her. She was amazed at his emotions, and eagerly enquir|ed the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In a di&s;tracted and incon&s;i&s;tent manner he in|formed her of all. He fell at her feet&mdash;her robe was enfolded in his trembling arms&mdash;his cheeks were dyed in palene&s;s&mdash;he be&s;ought her to for|give the impetuo&s;ity of that love which tempted him to tarni&s;h the lu&s;tre of his honour.</P>
<P>My wife, my beloved, the hand of violence, he exclaimed, may wre&s;t thee from me. Oh, do thou, I conjure thee by all our hopes of happi|ne&s;s, endeavoured to le&s;&s;en thy attractions. Alas! I have &s;till no hopes, My Elfrida mu&s;t be ever too exqui&s;itely lovely.</P>

When recovered from her fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;he quickly comprehended his meaning; &s;he de|&s;ired him to fear nothing from her want of pru|dence; then expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h to be alone, he retired.</P>
<P>Elfrida continued a con&s;iderable time in pro|fround meditation; then &s;uddenly &s;tarting from the &s;eat, Bertha, cried &s;he, to her mo&s;t favoured attendant, are you not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at what we have ju&s;t now heard. The Baron has played us rather fal&s;e; yes, &s;aid &s;he, traver&s;ing with ha&s;ty &s;teps her chamber, then &s;topping before a mir|ror, a diadem would not have been unbecoming this brow, nor would this hand looked very ill in wielding a &s;ceptre.</P>
<P>Yes, madam, I really think the Baron has played a truant game; Oh, &s;urely, Queen would have been much better than a &s;imple Barone&s;s; be&s;ides, I &s;hould have been your maje&s;ty's maid of honour, the Lady Bertha, and my two little brothers pages&mdash;Queen Elfrida, a mo&s;t beautiful title, we &s;hould have had our envoys, our pleni|potentiaries, our &s;tate days, while all the people would be &s;houting, long live the glorious Queen Elfrida.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s flung her&s;elf in a mu&s;ing po&s;ter on a &s;ofa&mdash;her mind never before was under the in|fluence of &s;uch agitations&mdash;brought up in the im|mediate pre&s;ence of her parents, her vanity had hitherto been controuled, but now all pa&s;&s;ions of particularly a&s;cribed to her &s;ex were rou&s;ed even

at the dangerous period, when la&s;&s;itude had weak|ened the &s;tronger faculties, and the fir&s;t ardour of love was deadened by the continual pre&s;ence of Ethelwald.</P>
<P>She was informed &s;he might have been united to a &s;overeign, brave, generous, beautiful; with him have &s;hared the glory of conque&s;t, the ho|mage of nations, and the admiration of mankind.</P>
<P>Hou&s;e of Devon, &s;he exclaimed, how little art thou indebted to Ethelwald&mdash;but for him thou might have been elevated to regal pow|er, perhaps immortal fame; but his &s;hackles have bound my hands, and the daughter of Ordun &s;hall &s;upport them with calmne&s;s; yet never &s;hall her high-born &s;oul a&s;&s;i&s;t his mean de&s;ign; &s;he will at lea&s;t prove to the royal Edgar &s;he was not &s;o un|worthy as depictured of &s;haring his honours.</P>
<P>Ethelwald was compelled to &s;et forward to re|ceive his &s;overeign. Edgar panted for revenge, but di&s;&s;imulation was now nece&s;&s;ary for the black|ne&s;s of his intentions. He met the Baron with a &s;miling a&s;pect, chid him with gentlene&s;s for his long &s;eclu&s;ion from the court, but vowed for the future to break in upon his dome&s;tic &s;y&s;tem of tranquillity.</P>
<P>The faint heart of Ethelwald was cheered by this reception, but it again &s;mote its tenement when leading to the Barone&s;s's apartment. To &s;eque&s;ter her he knew would have been impo&s;&s;i|ble;

even a pretext of illne&s;s mu&s;t have excited &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>The folding doors were flung open by two fair boys. Elfrida re&s;ted on a &s;ofa, the younge&s;t of her attendants ranged around; but what horrors bla&s;ted the eyes of Ethelwald on beholding her &s;urpa&s;&s;ing loveline&s;s. Her habit conveyed an idea of &s;plendor without heavine&s;s; a robe of pale blue carele&s;&s;ly &s;potted with &s;ilver fell far beneath her feet; the delicacy of her wai&s;t was di&s;played by a confining girdle of pearls: her bo&s;om poli&s;h|ed and white beyond compare was faintly &s;haded by the decorating lace; her &s;hining tre&s;&s;es un|bound to &s;hew the luxuriance of their growth, had now no other covering than a light veil, which falling back in &s;eemingly artle&s;s folds di&s;|covered a face the model of human beauty.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e with a kind of dignified di&s;order, &s;he &s;tept forward, her knee touched the ground to pay her fir&s;t obei&s;ance to her King; the re&s;i&s;t|le&s;s glow of mode&s;ty mantled quick upon her cheek; her lips &s;carce emitted a &s;ound; nor was one articulate &s;ave the tremulous word of wel|come.</P>
<P>Edgar gazed upon her with a&s;toni&s;hment, he was transfixed like a &s;tatue, and his eyes alone evinced his animation.</P>
<P>All is lo&s;t, cried Ethelwald to him&s;elf&mdash;his crim&s;oned cheek changing to the hue of death.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="034525_0066_0FFE19D96CFD5968">
The King recollected him&s;elf; he could have fallen pro&s;trate to implore Elfrida's forgivene&s;s, for permitting her continuance in &s;uch a po&s;ture; he rai&s;ed her, re&s;eated her on the &s;ofa, him&s;elf be&s;ide her. Lady, &s;aid he, we and our court can &s;carcely pardon the Baron for concealing in in|vidious &s;hades &s;uch perfections. If anxious for a reconciliation, he mu&s;t no longer monopolize from the world &s;o valuable a trea&s;ure&mdash;he glanc|ed at Ethelwald&mdash;the hand of di&s;may was bu&s;y with his features, and marked too legibly the emotion of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Thou art my victim, &s;aid the king to him&s;elf, thou &s;hall no longer triumph in treachery, the &s;oft hand I have touched &s;hall yet be mine.</P>
<P>It was his wi&s;h, however, to di&s;&s;ipate the fears he excited; he only therefore treated Elfrida with the politene&s;s due to her &s;tation. To the Baron, he behaved with aditional complacency; repeatedly a&s;&s;ured him he would no longer allow him to be retired from court.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s called forth every charm. Af|ter a few trifling excu&s;es her voice accompanied the lute&mdash;'twas thrilling melody&mdash;nor did her manner le&s;s delight; and Edgar felt in being robbed of the heire&s;s of Devon he lo&s;t the mo&s;t perfect of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>Ethelwald at night attended him to his apart|ment&mdash;Baron, exclaimed the King, (when alone with him) you have not acted quite well to me, yet imagine not, he continued, (perceiving his

<P>My mo&s;t gracious fire, my too kind, too in|dulgent ma&s;ter, &s;aid Ethelwald, &s;inking at his feet, I have not merited this clemency; 'tis an agravation of my crime&mdash;but if the &s;tricte&s;t vows, the &s;incere&s;t re&s;olutions of un&s;haken fidelity can extenuate my conduct, Ethelwald for ever &s;hall not be recorded in the black volumes of perfidy and guilt.</P>
<P>The King appeared affected, he rai&s;ed him, he pre&s;&s;ed his hand, he reiterated his profe&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s. The night waned away; the chace was to commence early the en&s;uing morning, and they &s;eparated.</P>
<P>Elfrida, who dreaded the remon&s;trances of the Baron for acting &s;o contradictory to his wi&s;hes, pretended to be a&s;leep when he entered her apart|ment, and when he ro&s;e by the fir&s;t dawn of light her eyes were clo&s;ed by its bal&s;amic influence.</P>
<P>Ethelwald's happine&s;s now &s;eemed &s;upreme; he had flung off that weight of apprehen&s;ions &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ive; the bright effu&s;ion of returning peace tinctured his brown cheek; the fire of his eyes was re-lightned; the chords of his &s;oul re|&s;umed

their ela&s;ticity, with flattering progno&s;tics of vibrating no more but to the &s;ound of gladne&s;s&mdash;he re&s;embled a wretched mariner, who, to&s;&s;ed by the whirl of winds and waters, attains at length the haven of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>A numerous retinue attended the King and Ethelwald, and in the mazy winding of the fore&s;t of Harwood they pur&s;ued the timorous &s;tag.</P>
<P>The King at length declared his fatigue; and expre&s;&s;ing a private wi&s;h to the Baron of &s;eeking a place for repo&s;e, they &s;oon dropt the party and penetrated into the tangled and ob&s;cure paths. Di&s;mounting from their &s;teeds they proceeded into the centre of the fore&s;t, where the interwo|ven branches of old oaks hid the pure light of day.</P>
<P>Here the King &s;topped, and withdrawing his arm from Ethelwald's, Baron, &s;aid he, this is a moment for private conference I have &s;ighed for.</P>
<P>My &s;ire does honour to his va&s;&s;al, he replied. Yes, re&s;umed he, I have longed, I have almo&s;t died to tell you, you are a ba&s;e, perfidious traitor; did'&s;t thou &s;uppo&s;e I would &s;uffer thee to enjoy the fruits of thy deception? I thought you had known the high and vindictive &s;oul of Edgar bet|ter. Ignoble Ethelwald I triumph over thee; that wife on whom thy eyes for the la&s;t time have fea&s;ted &s;hall be mine ere thy clay-cold coverlet is green&mdash;thus, exclaimed he, drawing a dagger he had concealed beneath his habit, may this

hand de&s;troy all who &s;hall dare to dimini&s;h the happine&s;s of Edgar.</P>
<P>Ethelwald &s;taggered at the blow which pierc|ed his brea&s;t; tis ju&s;t, he groaned&mdash;but oh, my wife! my El&mdash;frida, he would have added, but a convul&s;ive writhing clo&s;ed his lips, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s he dropped back.</P>
<P>The en&s;anguined &s;teel fell from Edgar&mdash;his hand &s;eemed nervele&s;s&mdash;he would have fled, but the entangling brambles fa&s;tening in his gar|ments, impeded his progre&s;s&mdash;he &s;topped pant|ing&mdash;his eyes involuntary fa&s;tened on the pale vi&s;age of the youthful Baron.</P>
<P>'Tis a bold deed I have atchieved, he cried, 'twas de&s;erved;&mdash;yet, how horrible is death&mdash;&s;o unprepared too; how gaily tinged was his cheek by that blood my dagger drank.</P>
<P>He extricated him&s;elf with precipitation from the baneful &s;hades, leaving the bo&s;om of the once gallant Ethelwald to be covered by the falling verdure of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The King was breathle&s;s as he gained his at|tendants; they &s;urrounded him with a&s;toni&s;hment, and &s;upported him from the &s;teed he could no longer &s;it. In faltering accents he an&s;wered their enquiries; they were &s;uddenly a&s;&s;aulted by va|grants, he e&s;caped with difficulty; Ethelwald&mdash;he was unable to proceed, the horrid re&s;t was gue&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="034525_0070_0FFE19E38907E7A8">
The piercing cries and lamentations of the do|me&s;tics row &s;mote his ears. Oh where, they cri|ed, di&s;tractedly flying about, where are the mon|&s;ters that &s;pilled the blood of gallant Ethelwald.</P>
<P>The King de&s;ired to be borne to the ca&s;tle; there Elfrida was devi&s;ing new &s;chemes to give a permanency to that admiration &s;he perceived kindled in his eyes.</P>
<P>A murmuring noi&s;e now re&s;ounded through, the ca&s;tle, by degrees it approached nearer to her apartment; the mo&s;t aged of the dome&s;tics ru&s;h|ed wildly in. He is gone, they exclaimed; he is lo&s;t forever. Oh, Lady, the hand of violence and barbarity has de&s;poiled thee of thy Lord.</P>
<P>Gha&s;tline&s;s and horror over&s;pread the features of the Barone&s;s; a kind of con&s;cious guilt per|vaded her &s;oul; &s;he &s;creamed faintly, and fell without &s;en&s;e upon the bo&s;om of Bertha.</P>
<P>She was &s;oon re&s;tored to rea&s;on, and the bitter|ne&s;s of &s;orrow, yet not that excruciating bitter|ne&s;s of &s;orrow which would have been her por|tion had her love for the Baron continued with its fir&s;t ardour; &s;he wept his fate, but her tears flowed not from the &s;prings of agony.</P>
<P>Edgar remained at the ca&s;tle; propriety might have forbidden his &s;tay, but he hearkened not to its pleadings; there was a guilty tran&s;port felt under the roof with Elfrida.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="034525_0071_0FFE19E660B2F8C0">
He had it reported to her that the body of Ethelwald was vainly &s;ought for by his de&s;ire, and as &s;oon as decency would permit &s;olicited and obtained an interview.</P>
<P>The &s;urpa&s;&s;ing loveline&s;s of the Barone&s;s amaz|ed his enthralled heart; her waning colour, her tears that ince&s;&s;antly flowed, the &s;olemne&s;s of her habit all worked upon the dormant powers of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>He experienced a trembling confu&s;ion; his eyes were averted; but with horror they fa&s;tened on &s;ome &s;cattered habiliments of Ethelwald; the deed however was accompli&s;hed, nor could he feel compunction with the prize in view; he re|covered his compo&s;ure and endeavoured to &s;ooth her. At length he imperceptibly led her into the path he de&s;ired, and mentioned, though with he&s;itation, his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Elfrida hung back at the propo&s;al; the re&s;erve of female mode&s;ty revolted at this &s;peedy mention of another choice; &s;he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer, lo&s;t in an anxious embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>Lady, cried the ardent monarch, I wi&s;h not to encroach on the rites due to the memory of Ethel|wald, but &s;urely when fulfilled I may expect you to li&s;ten to my &s;uit.

primeval du&s;t. Oh! rai&s;e thy benign eyes upon me, nor let me find that the daughter of Ordun has be|held the va&s;&s;al with more approbation than a King.</P>
<P>He was &s;topped by the ri&s;ing impetuo&s;ity of his emotions.</P>
<P>The idea of Ethelwald was fading from Elfri|da's &s;oul; &s;he beheld at her feet a &s;uppliant in a young lovely &s;overeign; &s;he forgot what was due to her departed lord; to the proud virtues of her parents; ambition and vanity like tor|rents bore upon native delicacy; &s;he promi&s;ed to be Edgar's when the term of mourning was ex|pired, and in that moment &s;ullied the hitherto pure brightne&s;s of her fame.</P>
<P>Let the young and blooming daughters of her &s;ex; from her example, beware how they &s;uffer an inordinate pa&s;&s;ion to gain admittance into their bo&s;oms; in&s;inuating its entrance, but diffi|cult its expul&s;ion; and may in one moment pre|cipitate them from that height of virtue which an unblemi&s;hed adherence of her rules had ele|vated them to. To unite again was not proper, but this &s;peedy contract; there was the wound to fair propriety.</P>
<P>The king left the ca&s;tle. The perturbations of Elfrida's mind &s;ub&s;iding; unoccupied, it &s;trik|ingly pointed out to her the &s;olitarine&s;s of her pre&s;ent condition; a dull &s;ilence reigned through|out the ca&s;tle; the dome&s;tics &s;he imagined re|garded her with a gloomy re&s;pect; in her pre|&s;ence the gay pipe of the &s;hepherd cea&s;ed; joy,

fleeted from before her, and the old battlements &s;he thought often &s;hook with an ominous vi|olence.</P>
<P>Unable to &s;upport tho&s;e ideas, &s;he re&s;olved on repairing to the &s;eat of her nativity, taking with her only tho&s;e &s;ervants particularly belong|ing to her. Here other emotions were awaken|ed; the remembrance of the parents &s;he had lo&s;t, of her lord cut off in the bright bloom of manhood, ru&s;hed upon her heart, and with it an agonizing &s;hame at the idea of the little re&s;pect &s;he paid their manes in &s;o &s;oon entering upon a new engagment. Her &s;acred word however was pledged to Edgar. To di&s;&s;ipate her melancholy &s;he &s;trove to rou&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions of vanity and am|bition; fruitle&s;s were tho&s;e efforts; an oppre&s;|&s;ive &s;adne&s;s marked her as its own, and Elfrida, like a young flower blown on by untimely winds, daily faded.</P>
<P>One evening's clo&s;e &s;he pro&s;trated her&s;elf be|fore the portraits of her parents; the wildne&s;s of &s;orrow agitated her fancy, and &s;he thought the brave Ordun, and his cha&s;te dame, bending down with an indignant wafture, de&s;ired her de|parture; &s;he &s;creamed, the cry drew the af|fectionate dome&s;tics; they rai&s;ed her from the ground, and wiped off the chilling dews which &s;tole upon her cheek.</P>
<P>Fraught with the &s;uper&s;tition of the times, the Barone&s;s re&s;olved on endeavouring to quiet her agonies in fulfilling an awful duty, by repair|ing to an abbey two leagues from the ca&s;tle, and
<PB N="71" REF="034525_0074_0FFE19F042CF3530">
getting the holy fathers to offer up prayers for the &s;ouls of her departed friends.</P>
<P>As &s;he made a merit of undertaking this pri|vately, &s;he commanded her attendants not to ap|proach her apartment till &s;ummoned; from which, by a &s;mall door, &s;he de&s;cended at the fir&s;t glimmer|ing of day, attired in a plain, though coloured robe, to avoid the &s;u&s;picions of pa&s;&s;engers of be|ing what &s;he really was.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbed in the profounde&s;t meditations, &s;he unwittingly turned unto a wrong direction; the path was through a wood wild and perplexed, and &s;he vainly &s;trove to extricate her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Unu&s;ed to &s;ojourn alone, fears of dire nature encompa&s;&s;ed her. She fled forwards with preci|pitation, the clearne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere chang|ing, &s;he expected the violence of the impend|ing &s;torm would bur&s;t on her un&s;heltered head.</P>

<P>Elfrida beheld a man of an emaciated though maje&s;tic form; a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s &s;weetne&s;s was ca&s;t over a countenance where care &s;at deeply en|graven; nor could the tear of pity be with-held on viewing tho&s;e white looks that &s;eemed to re|quire a &s;ofter pillow than &s;orrow for repo&s;e.

She was pre&s;&s;ed to partake of a vegetable fea&s;t. The old man expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize at her wan|dering in that lone&s;ome fore&s;t unprotected.

<HEAD>THE GENEROUS LADY.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH.</HEAD>
<P>AN amiable young lady was one day walking with her little dog, on the banks of a ri|ver which bordered on a delightful wood: and as &s;he was there mu&s;ing on the verdant turf, this little bea&s;t, which was rambling about, entered the wood, which he had no &s;ooner done than he &s;et up a great cry, and returned &s;eemingly terri|fied towards its mi&s;tre&s;s. Eliza, (for this is the lady's name) paid &s;carce any attention to it at fir&s;t; but finding it would not quit the place from which it ince&s;&s;antly came and returned bark|ing, her curio&s;ity led her to &s;ee what occupied the attention of this little animal. She imagin|ed it to be nothing of any moment, as it always returned without receiving the lea&s;t injury, and likewi&s;e that what &s;eemed to concern it, appeared to be on one &s;ide the wood; the lady therefore went there to inform her&s;elf of the rea&s;on of it: but how great, how va&s;t was her &s;urprize, when &s;he &s;aw behind a large bu&s;h, a young cavalier ly|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ng motionle&s;s on the ground, weltering in his
<PB N="89" REF="034525_0092_0FFE1A228BBAD2A8">
blood, which had dyed the adjacent turf: his face was pale, and disfigured, &s;eeming &s;till de&s;ir|ous to conclude its unfini&s;hed &s;peech. At this &s;o horrible a &s;pectable, the hairs of Eliza's head &s;tood on end; her legs failed her, and being &s;eized with a cold &s;weat, had almo&s;t dropped into a &s;woon. But the fir&s;t emotions being pa&s;t, and the lady returning to her&s;elf, &s;he conjectured it might be &s;ome one that had been attacked by thieves, and who in his pre&s;ent condition, &s;tood in need of immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Re&s;uming fre&s;h courage, &s;he approached the wounded per&s;on, and &s;poke to him: but alas! he had neither ears to hear, nor eyes to &s;ee. Eliza, therefore, judged it expedient to ha&s;ten all po&s;&s;i|ble &s;uccour. She therefore began &s;earching for the wounds, in order to bind them as well as &s;he could, and &s;top the blood which proceeded from them. One was on the che&s;t, one on the right brea&s;t, and one on the left thigh, from the latter of which ran a greater quantity of blood than from the two others. As her handkerchief, and that of the cavalier's, were only &s;ufficient to bind two of them, &s;he was obliged to tear her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dre&s;s for the third, as her gown, which was of &s;ilk embroidered with gold would have inflamed them.</P>
<P>After &s;he had done this, &s;he went in &s;earch of &s;ome one, to carry the wounded per&s;on to her ca&s;tle; and luckily, in her way &s;he met with two men and a woman, who were going to a neigh|bouring
<PB N="90" REF="034525_0093_0FFE1A2563CE4E38">
village. She immediately called to them, and having related what &s;he had &s;een, &s;he &s;ent the woman to her ca&s;tle, to de&s;ire the &s;ervants to go in immediate &s;earch of &s;ome phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons in different places. She then returned with the two men to the cavalier, that they might bring him away without delay. Fortunately one of them had an empty &s;ack with him, &s;o that by cutting two &s;trong poles, which was pa&s;&s;ed through it, they made a very convenient litter. They cavalier was placed thereon, and carried gently to the ca&s;tle, where the lady, who ac|companied him, ordered him to be put in her own bed, her chamber being nearer than either of the others. As the &s;urgeons were not as yet arrived, &s;he gave &s;ome cordials to this unhappy man, who began to &s;how &s;ome &s;igns of life.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the cavalier was as yet in&s;en&s;ible. Eliza having a de&s;ire to know the name and qua|lity of this new ho&s;t, &s;he &s;earched his pockets, to &s;ee whether &s;he could find any papers or letters which might inform her in &s;ome degree who he was. There were &s;ome for different per&s;ons at Paris; but as they were all &s;ealed, &s;he did not chu&s;e to open them, as &s;he would rather have re|mained in &s;u&s;pence, than to have done it; but in a &s;hort time, &s;he found in another place two pa|pers, which were not &s;ealed, the one was direc|tions for a particular road, and the other a bill of exchange, addre&s;&s;ed to a banker at Paris; in the latter of which &s;he learned that the name of the young cavalier was Alvar, and that he came from Germany.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="034525_0094_0FFE1A2990E71A48">
Some time after the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons ar|rived, they examined and probed the wounds, and unanimou&s;ly agreed that they were not dan|gerous; which gave inexpre&s;&s;ible joy to the lady. She de&s;ired a phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon to &s;tay; &s;he treated them generou&s;ly, and begged them re|peatedly to pay every po&s;&s;ible attention to the young cavalier. As the lo&s;s of blood was the only occa&s;ion of his weakne&s;s, they made no doubt but they &s;hould &s;oon be able to recover the &s;trength he had lo&s;t. And indeed the were right, for the prudence of the phy&s;ician, the &s;kill of the &s;urgeon, re&s;t, and good nouri&s;hment, re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the cavalier in le&s;s than five days. The lady over-joyed to &s;ee that her great care for Alvar would be the means of her re&s;toring him to his life, frequently came with extreme anxiety to mi|tigate as much as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could, the &s;tate which he was in. She related nothing but what was agreeable during his illne&s;s, and cau&s;ed vo|cal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic to be played before him, which greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted his &s;pirits. As &s;oon as he was able to eat, &s;he ordered the table to be placed by his bed-&s;ide, and two of her compani|ons, with the phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon to keep him company. But it is very remarkable, that the lady never a&s;ked the cavalier, how it had happened he was &s;o ill-treated. It was now &s;ix weeks &s;ince the fatal day of his misfortune, when Eliza, who was in the parlour with Alvar (and whom &s;he knew to be well enough not to fear a relap&s;e,) a&s;ked how, and by what means he had been &s;o barbarou&s;ly treated: Alvar began thus:</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="034525_0095_0FFE1A2B179CCCC0">
"This accident, &s;ays he, "is in con&s;equence of an adventure that befel me at Cologne, and which has been the occa&s;ion of my quitting that pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce for ever." Eliza would not a&s;k him what that adventure was; but Alvar, perceiving it was only through politene&s;s, explained him&s;elf, con|tinuing thus: "This adventure, Madam, is by no means unworthy your curio&s;ity, and though it calls &s;ad ideas to my mind, it is neverthele&s;s highly nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould often think of it, as it is the &s;ubject of my con&s;olation. I was," added he "in love with one of the fir&s;t, and, without flattery, the mo&s;t amiable young lady in Germany. I was prefered before all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rivals, who had great e&s;tates; I had almo&s;t obtained a per&s;on, whom I &s;hould have valued more than the whole univer&s;e. Judge your&s;elf my inexpre&s;&s;ible hap|pine&s;s! &s;he was granted me; they looked upon me not as her lover but as their &s;on. One day as I was in the country, walking in a little park, I heard &s;ome one &s;peaking in a low voice to ano|ther, and as I approached nearer behind a thick bu&s;h, I heard very di&s;tinctly the&s;e words. "No; I tell you, as long as love &s;hall favour us, a&s;&s;ure that I will never marry Alvar; neither will I con|&s;ent to be his wife, unle&s;s you abandon me." Gue&s;s, Madam, my a&s;toni&s;hment, and how much it was augmented, when I perceived that an in famous valet was the Medor, of this angel; and that whil&s;t &s;he was &s;peaking to him in this &s;train, her head was reclined on him, and her bo&s;om polluted with the hand of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wretch. I cannot de&s;cribe my feelings; I experinced every thing that rage could inflict the mo&s;t cruel on me
<PB N="93" REF="034525_0096_0FFE1A2CAA99DE58">
I &s;at down on the gra&s;s, and heard my perfidious love repeat, with a thou&s;and oaths, that &s;he would forever adore this mon&s;ter, even in ca&s;e her lot &s;hould oblige her to be another's. This valet exhorted her not to break them: and, af|ter having &s;poken in ill terms of me, he ki&s;&s;ed her ince&s;&s;antly. I was not able to contain the rage I was in. I cried out, O! perfidious wretch|es: and drawing my &s;word, ru&s;hed into the wood, the entrance was on the other &s;ide, the cur&s;ed valet had time to make his e&s;cape; and as for my traitre&s;s, I neither deigned either to &s;tab or &s;peak to her.</P>
<P>I then mounted my hor&s;e (for her father's &s;ta|bles were clo&s;e by), and returned to the city, informing the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, that I was not well. My countenance made it vi&s;ible to every one; when I arrived at Cologne I went to bed; but the de&s;pair and grief that agitated my heart, would not permit me to remain there, I &s;oon aro&s;e again, remounted my hor&s;e, and went out of the city attended only by one &s;ervant, and travelled without knowing whither I was going; till be|ing worn out with la&s;&s;itude and &s;orrow, I arrived at a vallage, who&s;e name I have forgot, and went to bed, without eating or drinking. As &s;oon as I laid down I &s;hed a flood of tears, when &s;leep &s;urpri&s;ed me in that &s;tate; but it continued but a very &s;hort time, for being interrupted by &s;udden agitations and gha&s;tly dreams, the image of my misfortunes pre&s;ented it&s;elf before me, and awaked me immediately. I was neither fatigu|ed or weakened, I felt nothing but &s;adne&s;s and
<PB N="94" REF="034525_0097_0FFE1A2F88C018D8">
de&s;pair: I got up and ordered my &s;ervant up likewi&s;e, and took the road to Aix la Chapelle, where I expected that the di&s;tance would allevi|ated my trouble. I had &s;carce arrived there, before I fell dangerou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that my life was greatly de&s;paired of. When I began to grow better, I received a letter from the father of my traitre&s;s. "I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at your proceed|ing," &s;ays he to me, "that I do not know what to think of you, in granting you my daughter, I &s;hould never have expected to have been treat|ed in this manner. Ju&s;tify your conduct to me, and know with whom you have to deal." This letter threw me into a great embarra&s;&s;ment. The re&s;pect which I always had for the father of this unworthy girl, and that friend&s;hip joined to the e&s;teem, which we &s;hould always &s;hew for the &s;ex, made me extremely unea&s;y, as I knew not how to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, without di&s;covering to him the infamy of this dete&s;table woman. For &s;ome days, as I was con&s;idering an an&s;wer, two cavaliers from Cologne arrived at Aix la Chapelle. They came after me, told me, that I was not ignorant that they had been the lovers of Chione (for that was the name of my traitre&s;s); they added that they came to revenge her, and to be revenged them&s;elves, for the contempt which I had &s;hewn her, after having been preferred before all my rivals. "What kind of revenge do you de&s;ire?" &s;aid I to them: "will you a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me here, or will you fight any where el&s;e like brave men?" "We will," an&s;wered they, "meet you with &s;word and pi&s;tol, when and where you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>Well, gentlemen," &s;aid I, "you will find me

<P>The time being come they drew lots, which of them &s;hould engage fir&s;t; for the worthy per&s;on, for whom they came to find me, was to be given in marriage to him who &s;hould kill me.

The &s;econd was with pi&s;tol, when my other enemy did not fare much better; I broke his left &s;houl|der, the ball entering towards the brea&s;t, and, to complete his misfortune, the hor&s;e mi&s;&s;ing his bridle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, and one of his feet catching in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, dragged his vanqui&s;hed ma&s;ter &s;ome paces into a fre&s;h plowed field.

As for me I left Aix la Chapelle, after having taken the mea&s;ures which we thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep both him and my&s;elf from trial, and from that time I never have known what be|came of my two rivals.</P>
<P>I went to another of my friends, which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> days journey from Aix la Chapelle; I remained there incognito for &s;ome time, where I was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with grief, that it rendered me like one &s;tupid. At la&s;t, I embraced this faithful friend, and &s;hed in his bo&s;om a flood of tears, without his being able to get any thing more from me. I &s;oon after &s;et out for France, and went di&s;gui&s;ed through bye-roads (for notwith|&s;tanding my precaution, the affair was di&s;cover|ed), when one evening I arrived at a tavern, where I refre&s;hed my&s;elf a little, and joined in conver&s;ation with the landlady, who, though &s;he was a little &s;warthy, knew very well how to draw people in. As &s;he was a fat merry dame, and one who &s;eemed to know how to fell her pro|vi&s;ions, I endeavoured but in vain to ea&s;e my mind, by di&s;cour&s;ing with her. In the interim, my &s;ervant going to the &s;table, overheard two men talking, when one whi&s;pered to the other, and &s;aid, "was not that him?" And as &s;oon as he went in, they followed after. He ob&s;erved without &s;eeming to take any notice, that they examined him in &s;everal things, and he did not

doubt but it concerned me, for which rea&s;on he came and informed me of it. I immediately con|&s;idered of the means to avoid the &s;nares that were laid for me. My valet entru&s;ted a maid-&s;ervant with the whole affair, and &s;he promi&s;ed us we &s;hould get away &s;afe, and have a guide to con|duct us to Limberg. She kept her word, for &s;he had previou&s;ly &s;ent the hor&s;es and guide, to the end of a bye lane, where &s;he conducted us. I ar|rived at that town, and made three days &s;tay; and the fourth, as I was going out on &s;ome po&s;t hor&s;es, my &s;ervant &s;aw the very &s;ame men he had &s;een in the &s;table; he came and informed me of it. About the middle of the day, I alighted at an inn, and went to &s;leep in a plea&s;ant orchard, clo&s;e by the road &s;ide; when I awaked I &s;aw four men well mounted armed, two of whom &s;eemed to be the &s;ervants of the others, and they appear|ed to be the men in que&s;tion. I thought at fir&s;t they were going to di&s;mount at the &s;ame inn, and by that means I could view them the better, but they per&s;i&s;ted in their journey. From this place I went to Cambray, to &s;ee an aunt, where I &s;taid two days, and the third I mounted my hor&s;e, and came to Rheims, where I remained a whole day; during which time my &s;ervant &s;aw the&s;e four &s;neaking fellows again, of whom I have ju&s;t been &s;peaking: he told me of it, but I did not believe him; and leaving that town I &s;et out for Meaux, where I have an uncle; and in pa&s;&s;ing through the wood where you found me, I &s;aw the&s;e envious cowards di&s;charge their pi&s;tols at me.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="034525_0101_0FFE1A3DA82F3B40">
Two of them fired without &s;peaking a &s;ingle word. One wounded me on the che&s;t, the other mi&s;&s;ed me. My &s;ervant was &s;o frightened, that he made off with all &s;peed; when I was immedi|ately &s;urrounded by four men. I laid hold of my pi&s;tol, and making to one of the four with a de|&s;ign to be revenged at lea&s;t of him, for the cow|ardice of his gang; but I had no &s;ooner fired than my hor&s;e threw me, and having da&s;hed me a|gain&s;t a tree, I felt &s;uch a terrible pain in my &s;to|mach, that I fell pro&s;trate to the ground. I had neverthele&s;s &s;trength enough to get up again, and po&s;t my&s;elf again&s;t a tree, near the place where you found me. Then the per&s;on at whom I had fired de&s;ired the others not to meddle with me, &s;aying, that he alone would &s;hew them the merits of each of them. The villain &s;aw that my life was at his plea&s;ure, he came to me &s;word in hand; I parried &s;ome thru&s;ts which was all I could do, at la&s;t I received one on my thigh, and I fell. The outrageous man immediately leapt on me; put one of his feet on my brea&s;t, and laid hold of my wri&s;t with both his hands, in which I held my &s;word, and took it from me, u&s;ing at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t abu&s;ive language; he then took off the ring which I had on my little finger, and af|ter he had got it (for I had not power to &s;peak) he ran my own &s;word into my body, &s;aying, "know that I am James, the lover of Chione."&mdash;I can a&s;&s;ure you, madam, continued Alvar, that notwith&s;tanding the condition I was in, I made this reflection, that &s;uch a lover was well worthy &s;uch a traitre&s;s.

<P>When Alvar had fini&s;hed this adventure, he ca&s;t his eyes on Eliza, and perceived that tho&s;e of that generous lady were bathed with tears, and that her face was full of fire.

<P>I was born at Blois, of a rich and ancient fami|ly. I lo&s;t my father and mother before I attain|ed thirteen years of age; and was entru&s;ted to the care of an uncle, who was as fond of me as of his own child. I was in my eighteenth year, when the nephew of one of the greate&s;t noble|men in Germany, came, with his uncle into France, to an e&s;tate which bordered upon that which my father had left me. I was there at the time with my uncle. The vicinity of our habi|tations, having given the young nobleman (who&s;e name was Beraldus) frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing with me, I &s;oon gained his affection; and his uncle al&s;o was &s;o fond of me that he wi&s;h|ed me for his niece. He &s;poke to mine, who received the propo&s;al with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure. I was informed of it, and as Cupid's darts had
<PB N="100" REF="034525_0103_0FFE1A4209960290">
already pierced me, my con&s;ent was readily granted. The time was almo&s;t come, when the marriage was to be con&s;ummated. The uncle of my intended hu&s;band was gone to take a &s;hort voyage, and we only waited his return.</P>
<P>As I was one evening in my chamber, reading the nineteenth book of Telemachus, I heard Be|raldus coming up; I immediately hid my&s;elf be|hind the curtain in order to di&s;quiet him. He came in, looked about, and not &s;eeing me, a&s;ked the chamber-maid (who came up with him) where I was, &s;he told him &s;he thought I was in the arbor in the garden. "There let her &s;tay, (&s;aid he)&mdash;my dear Martina, let us profit by a happy moment, which Heaven has &s;ent us; come my deare&s;t life! into the arms of a man who love and adores you more than any one el&s;e in the world." He was going to place her on his knee, when &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf by him, and began to reproach him for the manner in which he con|ducted him&s;elf towards me, and for attending too much to the things which concerned me; for ca&s;ting his attractive eyes too often on me, and that the day before, he had eat an orange which I had peeled, though &s;he had forbid him to do it: "You know (&s;aid &s;he) what I have done for you, and the condition into which I am brought, for having loved you too much; I have ruined my&s;elf and you al&s;o." When &s;he had &s;aid this &s;he wept: and Beraldus throwing him|&s;elf at her feet extricated him&s;elf as well as he could, from the reproaches &s;he had ca&s;t on him.

with execrable oaths, that he, from his &s;oul, loved her infinitely better than he did me; and that was he his own ma&s;ter, he would marry her in &s;pite of every thing: but he was grieved to think it was his misfortune, to depend on an uncle whom he dur&s;t not contradict, who had already thought of making him marry a per&s;on whom he hated to the greate&s;t degree, and that it was to avoid &s;uch a lot, that he determined to marry me, as he had no great aver&s;ion to it: "For though I may have loved her, (&s;aid he) yet you may a&s;|&s;ure your&s;elf, I &s;hall no more." He promi&s;ed to give her evident marks of it when he had marri|ed me, as he &s;hould then be ma&s;ter, and that af|terwards &s;he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured &s;he &s;hould be his greate&s;t favorite.</P>
<P>After all this excellent di&s;cour&s;e, Beraldus clung round Martina's neck, and after having comfort|ed him&s;elf anew with uninterupted ki&s;&s;es, and fre&s;h prote&s;tations of love, he carried her to a couch. As I was not able to with&s;tand &s;uch a &s;cene, I made a ru&s;tling behind the curtain, which Beraldus no &s;ooner heard, than he took flight; but the coquette had the a&s;&s;urance to come and look, and, upon &s;eeing me, endeavoured to &s;trike me with a dagger, which &s;he had with her, but I parried the blow, and &s;he immediat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly &s;wooned away. I took the poignard from her, hid it, and called &s;ome women to carry her out of my room, and take care of her. But &s;he e&s;ca|ped in the night, without my ever knowing what became of her after. As for my part, after ha|ving

well weighed the affair, I thought it nece&s;|&s;ary my uncle &s;hould know it. You may judge his &s;urprize when I told him of it; but I cannot de&s;cribe to you his indignation. Old as he was, he mounted his hor&s;e, and went in &s;earch of Be|raldus, but, luckily for him, he was not to be found. The next day my uncle wrote to his &s;on, who was at Paris, to repair to him immediately, to go with him to demand reparation for the in|&s;ults he had made me, if the uncle of my traitor, at his return, did not give him &s;ufficient re&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>During the time that Beraldus was at his uncle's, he had learnt, and was acquainted with the manners and cu&s;toms of our hou&s;e: he knew my uncle &s;lept &s;everal hours about noon, and that mo&s;t of the family did the &s;ame, except my&s;elf, who went generally into a little bower, which was &s;ituated at the farther part of the gar|den, to keep me from &s;leeping, and likewi&s;e the heat. As I was one day there, occupied with reading the life of a &s;acred per&s;onage, I was &s;ud|denly &s;urprized by two men ma&s;ked, who imme|diately laid hold of me, and &s;topt my mouth with a handkerchief, covered my body with a cloak, and carried me over a low wall, where they had placed a ladder on each &s;ide. They put me in a coach and four, and drove me off, accompanied by two other men on hor&s;eback. I endeavoured to cry out, but they paid no regard to it; for the hor&s;es went full &s;peed till we came to a kind of wood, which was about three leagues from my hou&s;e, where there were relays; and &s;oon after
<PB N="103" REF="034525_0106_0FFE1A4A9E0D8AE0">
they were put in, one of the men, unma&s;ked him|&s;elf, and I perceived it was Beraldus. I was not at all &s;urprized at it, for I thought on my way, that he was the author of this cruel action. The villain looked at me obliquily, and with as much impudence as though I had been a pro&s;titute, with whom he wanted to divert him&s;elf; and tho&s;e looks made my whole body tremble, for the dan|gers which I expected to encounter. After ha|ving looked at me &s;ome time without &s;aying any thing, he was going to &s;peak, but he knew not how, or where to begin. However, with a great deal of difficulty, he very coolly a&s;ked par|don for what he had done, and making but a bungling preamble, made me under&s;tand that it was merely for want of opportunity, that he did not explain him&s;elf more fully to me. I made no reply. He then a&s;&s;ured me that every re&s;pect po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be paid me, and that I &s;hould be as &s;ecure where they &s;hould conduct me, as in my own hou&s;e: that by marrying me, he made no doubt but he &s;hould &s;atisfy me of the regard he always had for me, and afterwards, he would let me &s;ee, by the mo&s;t inviolable friend&s;hip, and the greate&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that he wi&s;hed nothing &s;o ardently, as to repair the faults for which he had given me &s;o ju&s;t rea&s;on to be incen&s;ed again&s;t him, I told him that his conduct in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, might, in part, remove the bad opinion I enter|tained of him; but as for marrying him, that &s;hould never come to pa&s;s, though it was at his plea&s;ure to &s;ave, or take away my life, which|ever &s;uited him be&s;t. "You will &s;oon change

<P>After having travelled the remainder of the day, and part of the night, we came to an anci|ent ca&s;tle, which had no other building near it, where there was a woman, who&s;e features old age had &s;hrivelled up, of an olive-coloured complex|ion, a curved and &s;harp pointed chin, an aquiline no&s;e hung over her mouth, and fine red purple eyes; &s;he had a daughter who appeared to be as old as her&s;elf, and I am &s;ure as ugly. They gave me a very friendly reception; and it was at that time (and not before) that I &s;aw all the per&s;ons that came with me: there were two of Beral|dus's friends, and the &s;on of the old woman I have ju&s;t been &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>They led me into a room, which &s;melt &s;o &s;trong of herbs, that it was enough to turn any body's brains; there were &s;carce any chairs one could &s;it on; the wall was full of chinks, though it was the be&s;t room in the hou&s;e, and the be&s;t furni&s;hed. On one &s;ide of this, I &s;aw another, which I imagined was allotted for Beraldus; I was not mi&s;taken. But notwith&s;tanding the condition I was in, I re&s;olved to arm my&s;elf with courage, and to be revenged, though at the expence of my life. Fortunately I happened to have the dagger I took from Martina.</P>
<P>They brought me chocolate, tea, coffee, &s;weetmeats, and excellent wines; all which I ac|cepted.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="034525_0108_0FFE1A4F062FC550">
I &s;hall pa&s;s in &s;ilence the exhortation which the old woman, her daughter, Beraldus, and his friends, made me, to determine me to marry him.</P>
<P>A &s;ly prie&s;t was al&s;o among&s;t them, who find|ing it in vain to talk to me, had the impertinence to &s;ay, "that if he was in Beraldus's place, he would &s;oon find out a method of obliging me: "think where you are," &s;aid he, "and do not force us to u&s;e violence, when we wi&s;h to treat you with lenity."</P>
<P>The&s;e words were as a prediction of what was to happen, and which really did. I had often times a mind to &s;tab my&s;elf, in order to avoid violence, which I &s;o much dreaded, and which I expected would be u&s;ed. After having &s;hed a torrent of tears, and &s;ent my prayer to Heaven, I opened my bo&s;om, and after having put the point of the dagger to it, I was going to pierce my heart, that I might rid my&s;elf of the trouble I was in, and the danger to which I was expo&s;|ed: but a divine hand had &s;topped me and pre|vented we from committing &s;uch a ra&s;h action. At the &s;ame time, I regretted having hindered Martina from putting an end to my life. As I could &s;leep neither night or day, it brought me &s;o low that I dreaded as much again the &s;ight of the barbarous Beraldus.</P>
<P>As I was one day praying to Heaven with great fervency, and with many tears, to deliver me from the wretched &s;ituation. I was in, and that I might not be the occa&s;ion of grief and

I was ready to faint away; but Heaven furni&s;hed me with &s;urpizing vigour. I looked at my trai|terous villain with &s;o much indignation, that he was obliged to keep his eyes on the ground. Neverthele&s;s, he had the a&s;&s;urance to lay hold of me, and being in great rage, he carried me up|on the bed; but while he was &s;eeking to di&s;ho|nour me, I di&s;engaged one of my hands, and having dexterou&s;ly armed it with my poniard, I pierced his back &s;o &s;uddenly, that it penetrated his heart; I have &s;till the dagger by me &s;tained with the blood of my traitor, and which I will one day &s;how you.</P>
<P>"How rejoiced I am," &s;aid Alvar, "but what became of you afterwards?"</P>
<P>Having thus murdered him, I went to the head of the &s;tairs, to li&s;ten if I could hear any thing; I went down without meeting with any body, and renewing my courage, I ha&s;tened in|to a craggy and dry road, which the &s;un imme|diately darted its rays on. I expected to find no|body here; but after going three hundred yards, I met a countryman, who was as &s;urprized at &s;ee|ing me, as I was &s;orry to &s;ee him. After h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> had

pa&s;&s;ed me, he turned about &s;everal times to look at me, and as he was going towards the ca&s;tle, I made no doubt but he would relate what he had &s;een. In this thought I called to him. "You appear to be a good &s;ort of a man," &s;aid I, "pray will you do me a &s;ervice?" "With all my heart," &s;aid her "Where are you going?" replyed I; "I am going to the ca&s;tle, &s;aid he, to fetch &s;ome nets for &s;ome gentlemen who are fi&s;hing at the end of this road." "Well, my friend, &s;aid I, "if you will conduct me &s;ecretly to a town which I &s;hall name to you, here is a pur&s;e of gold which I will give you; but you mu&s;t come immediately." The poor countryman, who had never &s;een &s;o much money in all his life, was tran&s;ported with joy: "Very willingly," &s;aid he, "but let me go home and fetch my mule, which you &s;hall ride on, and afterwards I will go with you to Rome." "Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> you get a mule without going home?" &s;aid I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> You are afraid," &s;aid he, "but I will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you; I am of the ancient Chri&s;tians," &s;aid he, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by St. Peter, (for he is my protector, and that of our pari&s;h al&s;o), I hope not to live another hour if I do not come and take you away immediately.

"Where is your hou&s;e?" &s;aid I: "It is near the river," an&s;wered he; "I &s;hall take my mule, and &s;end my &s;on to carry the nets to the gentlemen; and without making any &s;top, I will return to you" I gave him &s;ome du|cats for his wife, and told him; that he mu&s;t go, and return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; that I &s;hould go and &s;it in the &s;hady part of the road." The poor

man flew like lightning: I repo&s;ed my&s;elf a little in the place I had marked to him. What el&s;e could I do? I could not &s;top him; and if I had not put confidence in him, I &s;hould certainly have been betrayed. After I had &s;tayed here a little while, I quitted it, and went even out of the road, upon a ri&s;ing ground, from whence I di&s;coverd a hou&s;e, which I imagined to be the countryman's. It was a little time after I had been on this emi|nence, I &s;aw a man on a mule coming from the hou&s;e, and this was the per&s;on I ardently wi&s;hed for. He came with all &s;peed, and, as &s;oon as he had joined me, I got his mule, and told him he mu&s;t conduct me on one &s;ide of Blois, through bye roads, that I might not be di&s;covered: and when we had pa&s;&s;ed through a few fields, I told him more ab&s;olutely, the name of the place I wanted to go to: and he promi&s;ed me I &s;hould be there before eight o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>What was my joy when on the mule? and how much mu&s;t it be increa&s;ed, when I was within &s;ight of my own hou&s;e, which you your&s;elf may &s;uppo&s;e, after all the dangers I had met with, and the misfortunes I had undergone!</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I reached home, I flew into my un|cle's room; but his countenance, far from &s;hew|ing the lea&s;t marks of joy, repre&s;ented to me a mournful &s;adne&s;s.</P>

"Has nothing happened to you?" &s;aid he. "Nothing," &s;aid I, "which can render me unworthy of you." The good man threw him&s;elf round my neck, &s;hedding tears of joy, calling me repeatedly, his deare&s;t niece. Soon after I related to him the whole of my adventure. He then told me what he had done to find out what was become of me: and whil&s;t we were in the mo&s;t affectioned emotions, Beraldus's uncle came in; he was ju&s;t returned from his voyage, and knew nothing of his nephew's conduct. My uncle de&s;ired me to relate it.</P>
<P>He paid &s;uch attention to it, that it was nei|ther interrupted by &s;peaking, or by the lea&s;t ge&s;|ture; except when I came to the death of his ne|phew; I wanted to explain to him the rea&s;ons which had actuated me to it. He told me to re|late it &s;imply; as he was only &s;orry at his &s;uffer|ing &s;o ea&s;y a death: for had he been alive (as he wi&s;hed he had), he &s;hould have expiated his crime with the greate&s;t torments.</P>
<P>After I had related every thing, he a&s;ked my pardon, and al&s;o my uncle's, for all that had happened to me. He de&s;ired to know what other &s;atisfaction we required; and a&s;&s;ured me, that he looked upon the affair in the &s;ame light as if it had been done to his own daughter.</P>
<P>He afterwards had a pen and ink, and with drew into another room, to-write to the go|vernor of Blois, to de&s;ire him to give preci&s;e or|ders,

for all tho&s;e per&s;ons who favoured the enter|prize of the infamous Beraldus, to be immediate|ly arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>The governor; who took care not to di&s;oblige &s;o great a nobleman, gave &s;uch &s;trict orders, that all the villains were taken, as well as the old wo|man and her daughter, put into pri&s;on, and part of them hanged.

<P>My uncle &s;et out a few days after for Ver&s;ailles, to a&s;k my pardon of the king, which he did in the pre&s;ence of the queen.

Here it is, &s;aid Eliza, &s;how|ing it Alvar. He looked at it, but his eyes were more fixed upon her hand, which, till then, had only beheld in the lovely Eliza, a benefactre&s;s; but now began to &s;ee an amiable per&s;on. The re&s;emblance of their adventures, had awakened his imagination: tho&s;e eyes which were &s;till be|dewed with tears, and that fire which he had ob&s;erved in Eliza, had made a great impre&s;&s;ion on him. In fine, this conver&s;ation produced the moment in which that plea&s;ing &s;ympathy was to di&s;play it&s;elf, which unites, better than any thing, two bodies which are made to love one another.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="034525_0114_0FFE1A619B3CBF70">
I pa&s;s by the re&s;t of Eliza's adventure, &s;he re|lated in what manner &s;he was &s;ent for to court by the queen, after having obtained her pardon; but as &s;he was ill, it &s;erved as an excu&s;e for her not going. Soon after, having &s;old all her e&s;tate to her fir&s;t cou&s;in, after her uncle's death, &s;he retir|ed with a great &s;um of money into a convent; but being tired with the fooli&s;hne&s;s of the nuns, and hearing there was an e&s;tate to be &s;old in the neighbourhood of Meaux, &s;he bought it. "And I am very glad I have it," &s;aid &s;he, looking at Alver, "&s;ince it has been the means of my doing you a &s;ervice." They were then interrupted by &s;ome per&s;ons coming in, which was di&s;agreeable to neither, as they were both at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay more.</P>
<P>Eliza &s;oon after Alver had been at her hou&s;e, had conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for him which was daily increa&s;ing, and which &s;he was afraid he would perceive; and Alvar was in the &s;ame &s;ituation. For as he not only &s;aw in her his benefactre&s;s, but a woman of the greate&s;t virtue and the mo&s;t amiable qualifications, he found it was not in his power to &s;tifle a pa&s;&s;ion he was no longer ma&s;ter of. What! &s;aid he to him&s;elf, am I then born to be the continual victim of love? Into what misfortunes has it thrown me? Scarce am I &s;aved from &s;hipwreck, but I am thinking to reimbark? But after having well weighed the&s;e pa&s;t reflec|tions, the merit, the virtue, the beauty, the cou|rage, and the genero&s;ity of Eliza, pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to him.

how happy would he have been, had they been placed in Chione, nothing could have equalled his felicity? but &s;ince he has found them in Eli|za, who has al&s;o in&s;pired him with &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s, why &s;hould he oppo&s;e a love which may cau&s;e the happine&s;s of his life, and &s;erve as a recompence for what he has already endured?

Still he had determined to make Eliza believe he was go|ing to leave her, and early the next morning he went into her room to &s;ound her upon it, telling her "that he thanked her for the many favors &s;he had conferred on him, and to a&s;k her permi&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o continue his travels?"

<P>They were married &s;oon after; he went to Pa|ris to receive his money, and they now live in the &s;weete&s;t harmony in the world, the more they know each other the more they love one another; and Eliza has given to her happy &s;pou&s;e, the fin|e&s;t children in the univer&s;e, as the fruit of their marriage.</P>

&s;he promi&s;ed me. I love Su&s;an much; &s;he is a &s;econd mother; but I love &s;till more the mother who is here (pointing to the grave). Mother! mother! what makes you lie &s;o long? When will you get up?</P>

<P><PB N="117" REF="034525_0120_0FFE1A72BA75F910">
Su&s;an was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing the gentleman come into her cottage with little Jac|quot, who pointing towards her with his little finger, and running to lay his head upon her lap, &s;aid, "Here &s;he is; &s;he is my &s;econd mother." She could not have expected &s;o extraordinary a vi&s;it. M. de Cur&s;ol did not &s;uffer her to remain long in doubt. He told her the &s;ituation in which he had found the little boy; expre&s;&s;ed to her the pity with which the &s;ight had in&s;pired him, and begged that &s;he would inform him concerning the child's parents.</P>
<P>Su&s;an pre&s;ented him with a &s;eat clo&s;e by her own, and thus began her narrative:</P>
<P>The child's father is a &s;hoemaker, who lives in the next hou&s;e. He is an hone&s;t, &s;ober, indu&s;tri|ous man, well made, and &s;till young. His wife was a good figure, but had bad health; &s;he was indu&s;trious and frugal. They were married &s;e|ven years, lived very well together; and would have been a mo&s;t happy couple, had they been in &s;omewhat circum&s;tances. Julian had nothing but his trade; and Madeline, who had been an orphan, brought her hu&s;band very little money, which &s;he had &s;aved in the &s;ervice of a worthy curate, who lives about nine miles from this place. This little money was applied towards purcha&s;ing a bed, a few articles of furniture, and a &s;mall &s;tock of leather, for him to carry on his bu&s;ine&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding their poverty, they made a &s;hift to live during the fir&s;t years after marriage, by their indu&s;try and frugality. But they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> chil|dren;
<PB N="118" REF="034525_0121_0FFE1A759583C448">
and this brought them into difficulties. They would however have been &s;till able to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, had it not been for &s;ome misfortunes which befel them. Poor Madeline, who worked daily in the fields, that &s;he might bring home a little money to her hu&s;band at night fell &s;ick in con&s;e|quence of fatigue; and her illne&s;s continued the whole harve&s;t and winter. Medicines were ex|pen&s;ive. On the other hand, work did not go &s;o well on as formerly: for many of Julian's cu&s;tomers dropped off, from an apprehen&s;ion that they would not be well &s;erved in a hou&s;e where there was a &s;ick woman. At length Ma|deline recovered, but her hu&s;band's bu&s;ine&s;s be|came no better. They were under the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing money to pay the phy&s;ician and apothecary. A total &s;top was now put to Julian's bu&s;ine&s;s; he had lo&s;t all his cu&s;tomers; and Ma|deline could gain nothing by work, becau&s;e her &s;trength was dimini&s;hed, and no body would em|ploy her. In this &s;ituation, the rent of the hou&s;e, and the intere&s;t of the borrowed money, entirely ruined them. They had hardly bread to their teeth; but they were happy if they could get a bit to give their children.</P>
<P>On hearing the&s;e words little Jacquot retired to a corner, and began to &s;igh.</P>
<P>It now happened that an unfeeling man, who was landlord of the hou&s;e, finding that they were not in a condition to pay him the two quar|ters rent which they owed threatened Julian that he would arre&s;t him. They begged him to
<PB N="119" REF="034525_0122_0FFE1A787180F940">
have patience till the harve&s;t; becau&s;e then they might earn &s;ome days wages by working in the fields; but neither their entreaties nor their tears cold have any effect upon him, though he was the riche&s;t per&s;on in the village. It was with great difficulty that they prevailed with him to &s;pare them only one month; but he &s;wore, that if at the expiration of that time, they did not pay him the whole &s;um, he would expo&s;e all their effects to &s;ale, and have Julian ca&s;t into pri&s;on. Nothing was then to be &s;een in this poor family but &s;uch &s;adne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s as might have &s;often|ed a heart of &s;tone. You may be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that my heart was often pained within me, when I heard the lamentation of the&s;e poor neigh|bours, and could give them no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I once went to their creditor, and begged that he would have compa&s;&s;ion on their di&s;tre&s;s, I told him, that if it was nece&s;&s;ary, I would pledge my &s;hift for the payment of his debt, though it was the only one I had. But this had no effect upon him. You are a mi&s;erable wretch as well as them; replied he; this is what I get by letting tenements to &s;uch a parcel of blackards. Ah! Sir (here the tears trickled down Su&s;an's cheeks), I could patiently endure that reproach, if that were all; but how much greater is my &s;uffering to be only a poor widow, and not able to afford a|ny comfort to the&s;e hone&s;t people! But to return to our unfortunate neighbours: I advi&s;ed Made|line to go and throw her&s;elf at the feet of the curate, whom &s;he had &s;erved &s;ome years as a faithful &s;ervant, and beg that he would advance her a little money. She &s;aid that &s;he would
<PB N="120" REF="034525_0123_0FFE1A7B4EC2C348">
&s;peak of it to her hu&s;band; but that he would have great reluctance to apply to the curate, be|cau&s;e he might imagine that he had fallen into all this di&s;tre&s;s by bad conduct. Three days a|go &s;he brought me as u&s;ual her two children, and begged that I would take care of them until the evening. She was going her&s;elf to the neigh|bouring village, to apply to a weaver about the &s;pinning of &s;ome flax for the payment of their debt. She never could think of having recour&s;e to the curate, her old ma&s;ter; but her hu&s;band re|&s;olved to make the the application in&s;tead of her; and he is gone for that purpo&s;e this very day. I have taken the charge of the children whom I love much, having been pre&s;ent at both their births. Madeline, at parting cla&s;ped them in in their arms, and embraced them as if it was for the la&s;t time &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ee them. I think I &s;ee her at this moment! Her eyes were full of tears, and &s;he &s;aid to the elde&s;t: don't cry, Jac|quot, I &s;hall &s;oon be back again, and will come to take you home. She took me by the hand, thanked me for promi&s;ing to take care of her children, embraced them once more, and went away.</P>
<P>Some time after, I heard a noi&s;e in their hou&s;e; but thinking &s;he was gone out, I &s;uppo&s;|ed it to have been occa&s;ioned by a faggot that had fallen on the floor; and therefore was not unea&s;y about it. However the evening came on and afterwards the night; and &s;till I &s;aw nothing of my neighbour's return. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thought of going to her hou&s;e, to &s;ee whether &s;he had gone home
<PB N="121" REF="034525_0124_0FFE1A7D5BF0ADF0">
to lay a&s;ide her flax, before &s;he &s;hould come to take away the children. I found the door open, and went in. My God! how I was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing Madeline lying dead at the foot of a ladder! I &s;tood motionle&s;s, and as cold as a &s;tone. I knew not what I &s;hould do. At la&s;t, after endeavouring in vain to rai&s;e her up, I ran for the &s;urgeon, who immediately came, felt her pul&s;e, &s;haking his head in the mean time, and &s;ent for the magi&s;trate. The people belonging to the police and the &s;urgeon examin|ed in what manner &s;he had died; and their vir|dict was, that either &s;he had been killed by the fall, or that not being able to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he had expired in a fainting fit.</P>
<P>I ea&s;ily conceive how the accident may have happened. She had gone home to take out of the garret a &s;ack for holding the flax; and her eyes being dim with weeping, &s;he had not &s;een clear|ly to place her foot upon the uppermo&s;t &s;tep of the ladder in going down, and &s;o had fallen with her head foremo&s;t upon the pavement. Her &s;ack, which lay by her, &s;hews that this had been the ca&s;e. The magi&s;trate, however, view|ed the matter in a different light. He gave or|ders that the body &s;hould be intered next morning before break of day, without any ceremony, at the extremity of the burying-ground: and he would i&s;&s;ue a proclamation for di&s;covering what was become of Julian. I offered to keep the two children with me: for though I find difficulty enough to earn my own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, I &s;aid to my|&s;elf:
<PB N="122" REF="034525_0125_0FFE1A830AB6B8B8">
God Almighty knows that I am a poor widow, and if I &s;hould have the charge of the&s;e haple&s;s children, his gracious providence can en|able me to &s;upport them. The little brother of this one has not continued with me long. So late as ye&s;terday, &s;ome hours after Madeline was buried, the worthy curate, in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he had &s;erved, called to &s;ee her. He knocked for &s;ome time at the door; and nobody opened it, he came to my window, and a&s;ked me where Ju|lian the &s;hoemaker was, who lived in the next hou&s;e. I an&s;wered that if he would take the trouble to come in for a moment, I had many things to &s;ay to him. He came in, and &s;at down ju&s;t where you are. I told him all that had hap|pened. He immediately bur&s;t into tears. At length I told him, that Julian had expre&s;&s;ed a de|&s;ign of applying to him in the pre&s;ent difficulty. He appeared &s;urprized, and a&s;&s;ured me that he had not &s;een Julian. The two children came to|wards him; he embraced them affectionately; and Jacquot a&s;ked him whether he could not a|wake their mother who had &s;lept &s;o long a time. On hearing the child &s;peak in this manner, the tears ru&s;hed again into the eyes of the worthy curate; and he &s;aid to me: Good woman, I &s;hall &s;end to-morrow for the&s;e two children and keep them about my hou&s;e. If their father returns, and &s;hould be in a condition to &s;upport them, I &s;hall re&s;ign them whenever he de&s;ires it. In the mean time I &s;hall take care that they be proper|ly educated. I was not much plea&s;ed at this I have the affection of a mother for the&s;e little children; and &s;hould be much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee

them taken away from me &s;o &s;oon. Sir, an&s;wer|ed I, I cannot con&s;ent to be &s;eparated from the&s;e children; I am accu&s;tomed to them, and they are likewi&s;e to me. Very well, good woman, &s;aid he; then you mu&s;t give me one of them, and I &s;hall let you keep the other, becau&s;e I know that you will be very careful of it: I &s;hall now and then &s;end you &s;ome little matter for its &s;up|port. I could not but readily comply with the good curate's propo&s;al. He a&s;ked Jacquot if he was willing to go with him. To where my mo|ther is! replied Jacquot; oh! yes, with all my heart. No, no, my little friend, I don't mean where &s;he is; it is to my pretty hou&s;e, and my plea&s;ant garden. No, no, leave me with Su&s;an; I &s;hall go every day to vi&s;it my mother; I'd ra|ther go there than to your garden. The worthy curate immediately de&s;i&s;ted from vexing the child, who went and hid him&s;elf behind the curtains of my bed. He told me that he &s;hould &s;end his &s;ervant to take away the younger one, who would have given me more trouble than the elder; and he left me a little money for the &s;upport of this one.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is all that I have to inform you concerning Jacquot's parents. What increa|&s;es my unea&s;ine&s;s is, that Julian is not re|turned, and that a report has &s;pread that he has gone to join a band of &s;mugglers, and that his wife killed her&s;elf out of vexation. The&s;e lies have &s;o circulated through the village, that they are the common talk even of the children; and when my Jacquot wants to join them, they drive

<P>M. de Cur&s;ol li&s;tened to Su&s;an's narrative with|out &s;peaking a word, but not without feeling the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of &s;ympathy. Jacquot now came back to her. He looked at her with an air of affection, and frequently called her his mother.

This is what I &s;aid to my&s;elf, my dear Madeline, and I afterwards ruminated how I might be able to ex|tricate you and me from our pre&s;ent difficulties in an hone&s;t way.

At la&s;t the thought &s;truck me in the head, and I thus &s;aid to my&s;elf: you are yet young, and of a &s;tout healthy con&s;titution; where is the harm if you &s;hould go and become a &s;oldier for &s;ome years?

<HEAD>THE CORNISH CURATE.</HEAD>
<P>TO pourtray one's own life with impartiali|ty, and to lay open with candour the movements of the heart; to dare to confe&s;s its merits; is perhaps as difficult a ta&s;k as can well be conceived; but, actuated by a regard for the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who have not yet determined on their future cour&s;e of life, and hoping that my &s;tory may &s;erve either to direct or to deter, I venture to lay it before the public.</P>
<P>I was born in a di&s;tant country in a remote cor|ner of the kingdom. My parents were above indigence, and their honor above imputation. A family pride, which had been handed down through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations, prevented them from &s;tooping to the drudgery of trade: while their hereditary e&s;tate, being in&s;ufficient to &s;ecure a genteel independence to them&s;elves, was of cour&s;e too limited to enable them to provide for the contingency of a numerous offspring.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="034525_0137_0FFE1AA56BADEE38">
I was the third &s;on, and of cour&s;e had but lit|tle to expect. My father early intended me for the church, and I was placed under an approved ma&s;ter, at a celebrated grammar-&s;chool. My di|ligence, let me &s;ay it, &s;ince I can without vani|ty make the a&s;&s;ertion, &s;oon procured me the good-will of my ma&s;ter; and the meekne&s;s of my di&s;po&s;ition, the favor of my &s;chool-fellows, of whom I was in a few years con&s;idered as the chief, and on every public occa&s;ion &s;elected by my ma&s;|ter, to prove his own diligence, and di&s;play my acqui&s;itions. In &s;even years I fini&s;hed my career of cla&s;&s;ical education, and left the good old gen|tleman with tears of filial affection; who height|ened my feelings by the &s;ympathetic regard which was con&s;picuous in his own looks.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear fondly indulging my fancy with a retro&s;pective view of tho&s;e hap|py days, tho&s;e years of unmingled felicity, when care has not planted her &s;ting in the human brea&s;t, or thought launched out into &s;cenes of fu|ture action, where mi&s;ery &s;o often da&s;hes the cup of life with her better draught!</P>
<P>There are, I Believe, but few per&s;ons, howe|ever happy they may have been in their progre&s;s through life, who have not made the &s;ame reflec|tions; and recurred with plea&s;ure to tho&s;e cloud|le&s;s hours, when the ta&s;k, or the dread of cor|rection, were the wor&s;t ills that could befall them: when the joys of the heart were pure and unalloyed, the tear &s;oon forgot, and the mind indifferent to what events might occur. If the fortunate have made the&s;e reflections, well may

<P>From the grammar-&s;chool I was removed to the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and entered on the founda|tion of Exter-college. The diligent appli|cation which had marked my former &s;tudies &s;oon rendered me con&s;picuous in the univer&s;ity; and I was complimented on every occa&s;ion, as a youth of uncommon genius, and unwearied a&s;&s;iduity. My heart began to be elated with the applau&s;es which were &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towed upon me; I was animated to get farther exertions of application; and in four years, took my batchelor's degree, and with an eclat which has &s;eldom di&s;tingui&s;hed a le&s;s diligent &s;cholar. I &s;oon became the object of univer&s;al admiration in the univer&s;ity; my future greatne&s;s was progno&s;ticated in the mo&s;t flattering terms, as one who would be an honor to literature, and a luminary in the church; but the&s;e compliments, however &s;oothing to the youthful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, only operated to di&s;tre&s;s me. The le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous could not endure me to bear away the palm of genius on every public occa|&s;ion; and the proud, the honored, and the great, began to affect a &s;upercilious contempt in my pre&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> which I am confident was neither &s;anctioned by their &s;ituations, nor de&s;erved by my con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ct; but as our harmonious Pope &s;ays&mdash;

The charms of &s;cience, and maxims of philo|&s;ophy, could neither in&s;pire me with fortitude, nor lull my &s;en&s;ibility. Too partial, perhaps, to my own merit, I was impatient of the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of di&s;re&s;pect; and my feelings were, about this time, put to a mo&s;t &s;evere trial, by the death of my father, after &s;o &s;hort an illne&s;s, that I was prevented from receiving his la&s;t benedic|tion. This calamity more deeply affected me than all my &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes; it was the fir&s;t I ever &s;uffered, and the keen edge of delicate &s;en&s;ibility had not yet been blunted by a frequent repetition of mi&s;ery. I re&s;igned my&s;elf into the arms of melancholy; and &s;ecluding my&s;elf from the impertinent or affected condolers of my own lo&s;s, indulged that exqui&s;ite kind of &s;orrow which &s;huns the obtru&s;ion of the world.</P>
<P>By my father's will I found my&s;elf entitled to 5001. which was all I had to combat the world, and e&s;tabli&s;hed my&s;elf in life; but had I been ren|dered by my patrimony what the prudent call perfectly ea&s;y, my grief would not have been le&s;s poignat, or my feelings le&s;s acute.</P>
<P>As my finances would no longer decently &s;up|port me at college, and my affliction for the lo&s;s of a beloved parent &s;tifled every throb of ambi|tion, and forbade me to launch into a more ac|tive cour&s;e of life, I embraced the fir&s;t opportu|nity of an ordination, at once to &s;eclude my&s;elf from &s;ecular employments, and to gratify my &s;e|dentary and &s;tudious di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

To engage in the mo&s;t &s;acred offices, without a more laudible view, may be excu&s;ed in the eyes of an unthinking world, but mu&s;t certainly ren|der a man highly culpable in the &s;ight of hea|ven: and, thought I am not con&s;cious of ever di&s;|gracing my profe&s;&s;ion, except my poverty and misfortunes may be thought to have degraded it, I have often reflected with &s;hame that I was not influenced by worthier motives.</P>
<P>Having a&s;&s;umed the &s;acred habit, I &s;et out for my native place with a pain and reluctance I had never before experienced. I reflected, that I was now not only bidding adieu for ever to the &s;eats of the mu&s;es, and leaving behind me &s;ome valuable friends, to whom I was attached by a &s;imiliarity of &s;tudies; but had likewi&s;e the me|lancholy con&s;ideration to &s;upport, that I had no longer a father to receive me in his longing arms, or a faithful friend to guard me from the decep|tions of the world. At the &s;ight of my native man&s;ion, the tears gu&s;hed involuntarily from my eyes; I was overcome with contending pa&s;&s;ions: and could &s;carcely &s;upport my&s;elf into the room where my relations were ready to receive me, before I fell lifele&s;s on the floor, and enjoyed a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of thought, and a con&s;e|quent relaxation from mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>On recovering, I found the whole family anx|iou&s;ly attentive to my welfare: and my mother, from her apprehen&s;ions for me, was in a &s;tate lit|tle better than that from which I was re&s;tored.
<PB N="138" REF="034525_0141_0FFE1AB0DE92D3F8">
She, however, &s;oon regained &s;trength to ble&s;s God that I was &s;afe, and that &s;he had lived to &s;ee me in holy orders.</P>
<P>Regardle&s;s of &s;ecuring any little advantage that might have accrued to me from my acceptance of accuracy, I continued &s;ome time with my mother and elder brother, pro&s;ecuting my theological &s;tudies with much application, and only allowing proper intervals for exerci&s;e or company. Time, the grand re&s;torer, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e doctrines of chri&s;tianity which are peculiarly comforting to the afflicted, brought me by degrees to a nece&s;|&s;ary campo&s;ure of mind. I gradually regained my wonted &s;erenity; and was ardently looking forward to my future de&s;tination, when a fre&s;h accident plunged me into the depths of mi&s;ery, and not only taught me to de&s;pair of finding friend&s;hip in a heart where the maxims of virtue are not inherent, but convinced me that the ties of blood may be bur&s;t a&s;under at the in&s;tigations of pa&s;&s;ion, and a brother with le&s;s reluctance &s;acrifi|ced than a &s;en&s;ual appetite abandoned.</P>
<P>To alleviate the grief occa&s;ioned by a beloved partner's lo&s;s, my mother had reque&s;ted the com|pany of a young lady, named Olivia, the daugh|ter of a neighbouring clergyman. She had &s;o often vi&s;ited in our family; and being nearly of my age, was my con&s;tant companion in every childi&s;h pur&s;uit; but as the impre&s;&s;ion on the brea&s;t of infancy is evane&s;cent as the morning dew, or the bloom of the ro&s;e, her remembrance had been almo&s;t effaced from my mind; and,
<PB N="139" REF="034525_0142_0FFE1AB2642134E0">
during the time which we had recently &s;pent to|gether, I had not left a &s;ingle emotion in her fa|vor, nor treated her with more attention, than the fair, the lovely, and the young, have always a right to expect from the manly and unpoli&s;hed heart.</P>
<P>It being now the vernal &s;ea&s;on, I happened, one fine &s;erene evening, to rove, with a book in my hand, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from home; till finding the &s;hades of night &s;uddenly &s;urrounding me, I ha&s;tened to return. My neare&s;t way was through tangled woods and unfrequented paths, and on this I gave the preference; but before I proceeded far, a female voice re&s;ounded from a neighbouring cop&s;e. Shrieks, entreaties, and prayers, which became more languid as I ap|proached, &s;eemed to be poured out in vain, and the voice died away in broken murmurs. With all the expedition the humanity could in&s;pire, I flew towards the place; but, judge my &s;urpri&s;e and &s;en&s;ations, when I beheld Olivia &s;truggling in my brother's arms, and &s;eemingly overcome by her exertions! At the &s;ight of &s;uch an unwel|come intruder, my brother &s;eemed confounded with &s;hame; he in&s;tantly for&s;ook his lovely prize; and, with eyes darting indignation, quitted the &s;pot without uttering a &s;ingle word.</P>
<P>Wounded to the &s;oul with his ba&s;ene&s;s, and melted by the piteous &s;ituation of the lovely object who lay &s;tretched on the earth in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, I was &s;carcely ma&s;ter of my|&s;elf. However, I &s;oon &s;ummoned a &s;ufficient de|gree
<PB N="140" REF="034525_0143_0FFE1AB40A3EE8D8">
of rea&s;on to attempt her revival; and I had the happine&s;s to find that my exertions were not in vain. As &s;he opened her fine blue eyes, and looked me full in the face, I felt an emotion which I had never before experienced. She &s;tarted back at the fight of &s;uch an unexpected deliver|er; and notwith&s;tanding my utmo&s;t endeavors, re|lap&s;ed into the &s;ame melancholy &s;tate. At length I again found means to re&s;tore her; when bur&s;t|ing into a flood of tears, "Eugenius," &s;ays &s;he, <Q>may every ble&s;&s;ing attend your life! May hea|ven &s;hower its choice&s;t favors on your head! and may &s;ome lovely and fortunate fair reward your virtue for pre&s;erving mine!</Q>&mdash;<Q>My dear|e&s;t Olivia!</Q> exclaimed I, with all the enthu&s;i|a&s;m of love, <Q>the hand of heaven &s;eems con&s;pi|cuous in this deliverance: and, if I may pre|&s;ume to expre&s;s the wi&s;h that lies neare&s;t my heart, may the &s;ame power make me the ever|la&s;ting guardian of that virtue which I have been &s;o miraculou&s;ly enabled to &s;ave!</Q>&mdash;<Q>My deliverer,</Q> &s;weetly returned the ingenuous fair, <Q>is entitled to every acknowledgment I can make; conduct me to my father, and lodge under his &s;heltering roof the child who is at his di&s;po&s;al.</Q> With this requi&s;ition I immediately complied; and as we agreed that it would be prudent to con|ceal the rude a&s;&s;ault of my brothr, which the malevolent world might have repre&s;ented more fatal than it really was, we re&s;olved to a&s;cribe the latene&s;s of our arrival to the finene&s;s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vening, and the charms of the &s;ea&s;on, which had attempted us to linger beyond our intended time.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="034525_0144_0FFE1AB85B19CA38">
The apology was ea&s;ily admitted; and as I was invited to &s;tay, I eagerly embraced the offer, as well to pa&s;s more in the company of Olivia, as to recover &s;ufficiently from my perturbation of mind before I met a guilty brother's eye.</P>
<P>Next morning I took leave of Olivia and her father; and during my walk; felt a dejection of &s;pirits, and heavine&s;s of heart, which could not have been exceeded, if I had been the perpetra|tor of villainy, and not the protector of inno|cence. The mind &s;eems often prophetic of its own fate, and intuitively to fore&s;ee the &s;torm that futurity is about to di&s;clo&s;e. I approached my brother with looks of indignation and pity; but, before I could utter a &s;ingle word, unlocked his bureau, "Receive," &s;ays he, <Q>your patrimony, and immediately quit the hou&s;e! I di&s;claim for a brother the wretch who can fru&s;trate my wi&s;hes merely to gratify his own, and this un|der the more dete&s;table ma&s;k of &s;entimental hypocri&s;y!</Q> Stung to the &s;oul, I replied, <Q>The power who &s;ees the rectitude of my views, and by means has defeated, the villainy of yours, will abundantly provide for me! I renounce an alliance with your ignominy, with the &s;ame plea&s;ure as you di&s;claim me for a brother: but let me caution you to beware, left your pa&s;&s;ions precipitate you into irretrievable ruin!</Q> With the&s;e words I ru&s;hed into my mother's apart|ment; and, falling on my knees, be&s;ought her benediction, before the opportunity was forever clo&s;ed. Too well acquainted with what had pa&s;|&s;ed, &s;he bathed my face with her tears; and be|wailing
<PB N="142" REF="034525_0145_0FFE1AB9DF0573B8">
wailing her haple&s;s &s;ituation, encouraged me to hope for a &s;peedy reconciliation, bidding me re|ly on her unalterable love.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;he lived but a very &s;hort time to real|ize her wi&s;hes; for within three weeks, &s;he fell a matyr to her grief, occa&s;ioned by the brutal in|&s;olence of my brother, in con&s;equence of her partiality to me.</P>
<P>An outca&s;t from my family, and equally di&s;|qualified by the delicacy of my feelings, and narrowne&s;s of my circum&s;tances, from elbowing my way in the world, I &s;carcely knew which way to direct my &s;teps. Love, however, which can illumine the darke&s;t hours of life, prompted my return to Olivia, that I might tell her how much my misfortune attached her to my heart. I revealed to the dear charmer my true &s;ituation, and concluded by a&s;king her advice re&s;pecting my future conduct. She immediately referred me to her father's &s;uperior experience; and I ac|cordingly communicated to him my fixed re&s;olu|tion of engaged in accur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, without a&s;&s;igning the mo&s;t di&s;tant rea&s;on for quitting my brother's hou&s;e. In con&s;equence of this communication, I had in a few days the happine&s;s to be informed, that an old gentleman, the rector of Crowan, a village near Falmouth, was in immediate want of a clerical a&s;&s;i&s;tant.</P>
<P>To him I pre&s;ently applied, and without he&s;i|tation clo&s;ed with his offer of allowing me twen|ty pounds a year; but as this &s;um would barely
<PB N="143" REF="034525_0146_0FFE1ABF6249D8E8">
find me in board, my patrimony began rapidly to decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Olivia, I need &s;carcely &s;ay, in the mean time engaged all my thoughts. Our love was mutual and &s;incere; and intere&s;t, that powerful incen|tive to modern contracts, was entirely overlook|ed by both, as her fortune was &s;till inferior to my own. In a few months &s;he con&s;ented to be irrevocably mine, and then I thought my felicity beyond the reach of fate. From this plea&s;ing de|lu&s;ion, however, I had the misfortune &s;oon to be awaked; for finding my income very inadequate to my expences, I began to &s;hudder at the tho'ts of involving a beloved wife in want and mi&s;ery. The&s;e gloomy pre&s;ages were too &s;oon realized by the death of my aged patron; an event which wholly deprived me of employment. This &s;troke was followed by the birth of a &s;on; which, tho it ought to have taught me economy, and &s;ti|mulated my exertions, only tended to lull my cares, and deaden my &s;en&s;e of want.</P>
<P>After vainly endeavoring to obtain another cu|racy, and being di&s;appointed in my expectations of a &s;mall living by the machinations of my aban|doned brother, Olivia's father was attacked with a paralytic &s;troke, which compelled him to re|&s;ign the care of his cure to me. The whole a|mount of his living did not exceed four&s;core pounds a year, and con&s;equently little could be allowed for the maintenance of a curate. My Olivia was again pregnant; when I found that, exclu&s;ive of &s;ome trifling articles of furnature and
<PB N="144" REF="034525_0147_0FFE1AC0E7F77DB8">
books, I had &s;carcely 100l. left: and, to add to my di&s;tre&s;s, a &s;econd paralytic &s;troke, and &s;oon after a third, deprived me of a valuable friend; who&s;e effects, when di&s;po&s;ed of and his debts di&s;charged, produced only about three&s;core pounds for his daughter's portion.</P>
<P>Being now de&s;titute of every friend, my bro|ther remaining irreconcilably inveterate, and a native ba&s;hfulne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition for which the world is not always candid enough to make pro|per allowances, having prevented me from ex|tending my connections, or &s;ecuring many friends, I was in &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation, that my mind began to &s;ink beneath its burden, and to become weary of &s;truggling with its fate.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect, however, again brightened; and I obtained a very de&s;irable curacy of thirty pounds a year, by the intere&s;t of a young baro|net, who had accidentally &s;een Olivia and her two infant children, and expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t de&s;ire to &s;erve us.

fondne&s;s, to reconcile me to life. Sir Thomas Smith, by who&s;e interpo&s;ition I had obtained my pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, likewi&s;e contributed all in his power to render my &s;ituation ea&s;y; continu|ally loading the children with pre&s;ents, and of|fering me the loan of any &s;um I might have oc|ca&s;ion for. Of this offer I too imprudently and fatally availed my&s;elf, by borrowing two hun|dred pounds. To corroborate our good opinion of his genero&s;ity, he bade me make my&s;elf per|fectly ea&s;y in my &s;ituation; for, on the pre&s;ent incumbent's death, the living &s;hould be in&s;tantly mine. I thanked him with an ardour that mock|ed the expre&s;&s;ions of form. But, alas! I had to deal with a man of the world; and found too &s;oon that I had placed my dependence where I had nothing to hope, and poured forth my grati|tude where my execrations only were due.</P>
<P>This unprincipled young man was our con&s;tant vi&s;itor, and encouraged our extravagance merely that he might have an opportunity of &s;upplying our wants.

Howe|ver, as he attached him&s;elf entirely to her, his para&s;ites and dependents, who &s;aw plainly that he had views upon her virtue, retired one after a|nother, leaving Olivia and him alone together.

<P>My pro&s;pects were now entirely bla&s;ted.

In three &s;hort weeks after my commitment, they were carried off by an epidemical fever: and the&s;e eyes, which never beheld the mi&s;ery of a &s;trang|er without be&s;towing the alms of pity's tear, were doomed to behold a wife and two innocents pre&s;s the &s;ame untimely bier.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF PAULINE.</HEAD>
<P>BY a youth of toil, of activity, of danger, De Rivieres, a French officer, had obtained an honorable old age, and a moderate competence of the gifts of fortune. With the exulting reflec|tion of having de&s;erved the gratitude of his coun|try by the blood he had &s;hed in its defence, he re|tired to a di&s;tant province, to prepare his mind for that moment in which he &s;hould be required to &s;et out on his journey to a <HI>bourne whence no tra|veler returns.</HI> The &s;olace of declining years he &s;ought in the dutiful endearments of an only daughter; and he found them. Pauline De Ri|vieres would be allowed by every one, but an antiquary, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a form equally perfect with that of the <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> and a face infinitely more plea&s;ing, by a &s;uperior expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weet|ne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility. Pauline had a heart feeling|ly alive to every tender emotion, and entirely devoted to her father. She watched his every look,&mdash;prevented his every wi&s;h,&mdash;and &s;ecluded her&s;elf from the world, in order that &s;he might
<PB N="151" REF="034525_0154_0FFE1AD4EE41E370">
not neglect any one of the duties a child owes to the author of its exi&s;tence. The ble&s;&s;ings, the af|fection of a father, amply recompen&s;ed her for this attention; and De Rivieres often exclaimed with rapture, that the &s;un of his life would &s;et calm, peaceful, and &s;erene.</P>
<P>The autumn of the fourth year of their retire|ment, and the completion of the &s;eventeenth year of Pauline's life, had now arrived, and the father re&s;olved to celebrate the event with a rural <HI>fete.</HI>&mdash;Dancing formed a part of the joyous entertain|ment; and Pauline was &s;elected by the Count De B&mdash;as partner for the evening. The Count's re|marks on the exqui&s;ite grace with which &s;he ac|quitted her&s;elf in the dance were, from the lips of a man of fa&s;hion, very flattering to a fond father; and Pauline her&s;elf was not without certain &s;en&s;a|tions, as agreeable as they were novel. From this period an acquaintance commenced between the family of De Rivieres and the Count, who was per|petually forming parties of plea&s;ure to entertain them. With all the openne&s;s, the genero&s;ity of a &s;oldier, De Rivieres, imputed this conduct to civility; and con&s;equently admitted the Count to intimacy and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Count was not blind to the favorable im|pre&s;&s;ions he had made: he &s;aw that the father e|&s;teemed him; and from the delicate confu&s;ion, which his &s;udden appearance always &s;pread over the cheek of Pauline, he drew a very fair infer|ence, that he had created in her brea&s;t a &s;entiment in its nature more tender than that of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="034525_0155_0FFE1AD7CD6B12E8">
The utmo&s;t freedom of intercour&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ted now between De Rivieres and the Count, who, in an excur&s;ion to the borders of a beautiful lake, threw out in the mo&s;t delicate manner a &s;uppo&s;ition of the confined circum&s;tances of the former. De Ri|vieres, incapable of any re&s;erve with a friend, gave a very candid account of his fortune, declar|ing in conclu&s;ion, that tho his circum&s;tances were not affluent, they afforded the means of ea&s;y and comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. An air of thotfulne&s;s was diffu&s;ed over the Count's features during the remainder of the walk. He did not, for &s;ome days afterwards, vi&s;it the habitation of De Ri|vieres, who was at a lo&s;s to find a rea&s;on for his ab&s;ence. Pauline too had <HI>her</HI> fears; but the&s;e &s;he kept within the &s;ilent &s;olitude of her own bo|&s;om.</P>
<P>At length the Count bani&s;hed the aprehen&s;ions of the family by his pre&s;ence. His countenance no longer wore a pen&s;ive or melancholy air:&mdash;it beamed with plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction.&mdash;The cau&s;e he di&s;clo&s;ed in an evening walk with De Riviers. "It had afforded him," he declared, "infinite unea&s;ine&s;s to find that a man, who had &s;erved his country with honor, &s;hould be &s;o &s;cantily reward|ed. In looking forward to futurity, he had al&s;o beheld how adequate the fortune he could leave his daughter would be to her &s;upport."&mdash;This was touching on the tendere&s;t &s;tring. A father's &s;orrow betrayed it&s;elf in &s;trong emotions, and &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wed that the idea had never &s;truck him &s;o for|cibly before. The Count continued his di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;"Under the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ugge&s;tions he
<PB N="153" REF="034525_0156_0FFE1AD98B422808">
had &s;tated, he had taken the liberty to make u&s;e of his intere&s;t at Paris, which he had every rea&s;on to believe would be of the highe&s;t advantage to him, if he &s;hould honor him by the acceptance of it."&mdash;De Rivieres was overwhelmed with grati|tude at the propo&s;al: he comprehended all the benefits which might re&s;ult to Pauline; and he therefore did not he&s;itate a moment in accepting it. The Count appeared delighted with his rea|dy acquie&s;cence; and an early day was fixed for the departure of De Rivieres for the metropolis.</P>
<P>Pauline was &s;oon made acquainted with the plan; and however di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the &s;eparation from her father might be, &s;he could not but feel the mo&s;t grateful &s;entiments for the Count. How lit|tle could the innocence of the daughter, or the generous &s;oul of the parent &s;u&s;pect, that the dark|e&s;t de&s;igns of villiany lurked under the angel form of a benefactor!</P>
<P>The day for the departure of De Rivieres at length arrived. Pauline melted with affliction; nor was the heart of the old &s;oldier free from the mo&s;t &s;orrowful emotions. He embraced his daughter, and ble&s;&s;ed her. Then leading her to the Count, "Generous friend," he exclaimed, "I commit to your charge, during my ab&s;ence, a trea&s;ure infinitely dearer to me than life. A fa|ther has nothing, &s;ave his God, more &s;acred than his child. Count! may I have no rea&s;on to re|pent the confidence I repo&s;e in you!" The Count received Pauline with the warme&s;t a&s;&s;ur|ances of protection; and De Rivieres, after one more tender embrace of his daughter, and an ex|pre&s;&s;ive

&s;queeze of her new guardian's hand, tore him&s;elf away.</P>
<P>Pauline, after the departure of her father, re|&s;igned her&s;elf wholly to the influence of affliction. The Count, while he endeavored to pour the balm of comfort into her wounded heart, was plea|&s;ed with this exerci&s;e of &s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;Critical judge of human nature, he knew that in the moment of &s;orrow the heart is more feelingly alive to tender &s;en&s;ations; and, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be allow|ed, more <HI>porous</HI> than in the hour of fe&s;tivity and joy. In the fir&s;t flow of grief, he told her not "the tale of love;" but his attention &s;o unweari|ed, his a&s;&s;iduity &s;o delicate, could not fail to produce &s;entiments of gratitude, of friend&s;hip&mdash;
<Q>A Friend&s;hip in Woman is &s;i&s;ter to Love.</Q></P>
<P>The lenient, a&s;&s;ua&s;ive power of time, her own endeavors, and the Count's diligence, at length re&s;tored her to &s;ome degree of tranquility, which received additional &s;trength from her protector's repeated a&s;&s;urances of the &s;peedy return of her father.</P>
<P>It was on one of tho&s;e evenings when the wind, as if unwilling to di&s;turb the lulling &s;tillne&s;s and &s;erenity, &s;teals through the groves in gentle &s;ighs, &s;carce touching the leaf that &s;oftly whi&s;pers re|&s;pon&s;ive to the breeze, Pauline was tempted to enjoy the univer&s;al calm, the Count accompany|ing her. A bo&s;om of apathy indeed mu&s;t he po&s;|&s;e&s;s, who on &s;uch an evening feels no increa&s;e of

&s;weet emotion. It was not &s;o with Pauline&mdash;Every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ibre of her heart thrilled with delight and harmony. Will it derogate from her virtue to &s;ay, that, for a moment her father was forgotten? The Count felt that the time was favorable; and he was re&s;olved that it &s;hould not e&s;cape him&mdash;he di&s;clo&s;ed a tale, "&s;oft as the zephyr's &s;ighs." It was heard without anger&mdash;it was an&s;wered with a permi&s;&s;ion to hope.</P>
<P>The Count had now laid a foundation, on which his future &s;chemes were to be erected.&mdash;Next day a letter came from De Rivieres to his daughter&mdash;replete with the obligations which the Count had conferred on him&mdash;and with the pro|mi&s;es he had received from the mini&s;ter, in con|&s;equence of &s;o powerful a recommendation.&mdash;Pauline was in rapture, and the Count was not le&s;s enchanted with the &s;miles &s;he be&s;towed on him. A &s;hort ely&s;ian month &s;ucceeded; and each day was now expected to re&s;tore a beloved father to his daughter's longing arms. One morning, after the expiration of the month, the Count paid his accu&s;tomed vi&s;it earlier than u&s;ual; his brow was clouded&mdash;melancholy was &s;trongly marked in every expre&s;&s;ive feature. Pauline beheld the change, and her bo&s;om panted with quivering fear. "Any new intelligence from my father?" &s;he exclaimed in an eager, yet tremulous tone of voice: "I have letters, Pauline, from Paris; but"&mdash;"Oh! give them me&mdash;my father&mdash;no ac|cident has happened to him!" The Count was &s;ilent, but taking from his pocket a letter, deli|vered it to her trembling hands. For a moment
<PB N="156" REF="034525_0159_0FFE1BE9D45C5B48">
&s;he held it, fearful of breaking the &s;eal&mdash;a tear fell on the &s;uper&s;cription. At length, with a kind of wild impatience, &s;he tore it open. Scarce, however, had &s;he ca&s;t her eyes on the fir&s;t line, when &s;he &s;unk lifele&s;s on the floor, Some hours elap&s;ed ere &s;he was re&s;tored to rea&s;on and to woe. On opening her eyes, &s;he threw them round the room&mdash;"My father! Oh! my father in pri&s;on!" The exclamation produced a return of fainting fits, which continued during the remainder of the day. At night "tired nature's &s;weet re&s;torer" clo&s;ed her eyelids; and the next morning &s;he awoke with &s;omewhat more calmne&s;s, tho with a heart &s;till overwhelmed in the depth of &s;orrow.</P>

<P>The Count &s;uffered the fir&s;t flow of grief to pa&s;s without interuption. He then waited on her in obedience to her own reque&s;t&mdash;Grief, he ob&s;erved had made great ravages on her cheeks; but in &s;tealing thence the ro&s;e, it had left, in the drooping lily, a more fa&s;cinating charm, a &s;tron|ger expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s. Pauline began by informing him of her determination to &s;et off in|&s;tantly for Paris, in order to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;|&s;es of her father by &s;haring them. The Count endeavored fir&s;t to per&s;uade her from her purpo&s;e, by painting the horrors of a pri&s;on in the mo&s;t gloomy colors. Pauline &s;huddered at the pic|ture;&mdash;but her re&s;olution was not &s;o weakened. The Count then informed her, that her father, in his letters to him, had commanded her not to vi|&s;it him. Pauline was &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;&s;he wept&mdash;&s;he &s;ighed&mdash;but the commands of a father &s;he held &s;acred.

<P>Pauline read the lines with &s;en&s;ations of ec&s;ta|cy, and de&s;ired to &s;ee the Count immediately.&mdash;He came&mdash;&s;he pre&s;&s;ed him to explain him&s;elf&mdash;he obeyed with &s;ome he&s;itation;&mdash;offered to pay her father's debts;&mdash;but the return he demanded was her per&s;on.

In|&s;en&s;ible to the firing of the cannon, and to every object around her, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on a &s;tone at the gate of the pri&s;on.

<P>The crowd, affected at the &s;ight, withdrew to a re&s;pectful di&s;tance. Every tongue was hu&s;hed into &s;ilence, while every heart melted with &s;ym|pathy.

<P>THE benevolent heart which per&s;i&s;ts in an act of beneficence, notwith&s;tanding all the malicious cen&s;ures of meaner minds, incapable of under&s;tanding its noble and di&s;intere&s;ted con|duct, is doubly prai&s;e-worthy; and it &s;ometimes happens that it does not lo&s;e its reward in the &s;en&s;e even of the votaries of &s;elf-intere&s;t, inde|pendent of that which it receives from the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing good to others.</P>
<P>Lucinda Harvey was a young lady of a mo&s;t amiable per&s;on, and a truly generous and &s;u&s;cep|tible heart. She had lo&s;t her father in her early youth, and had lived with her mother, who re|&s;ided in a village at no great di&s;tance from Lon|don, on a &s;mall jointure. They were not rich, but they were &s;atisfied and happy; and the pro|priety
<PB N="164" REF="034525_0167_0FFE1AF72A79B7E0">
of their deportment procured them the e&s;|teem and friend&s;hip of all their neighbours.</P>
<P>I happened, that, one evening, as &s;he walked out in a little clo&s;e behind the hou&s;e, &s;he found a female infant of about a twelvemonth old, lying on the ground, and crying piteou&s;ly. The child had evidently been de&s;erted a few hours before, by &s;ome per&s;on, who had left it there to peri&s;h, or be pre&s;erved by chance. Lucinda took it up, and brought it in to her mother. Every enquiry was made to di&s;cover the per&s;on who had thus de&s;erted it, but every enquiry proved fruitle&s;s. The child, however, by its beauty, and helple&s;s &s;ituation, won &s;o much on the feeling heart of the tender Lucinda, that &s;he per&s;uaded her mo|ther not to re&s;ign it to the rigours of a pari&s;h maintenance; but let it be brot up with them, as if it were her fa&s;ten. "It can require but little," &s;aid &s;he, "and who can &s;ay how amply Provi|dence may repay us." The infant had hanging round its neck, when it was found, the minature portrait of a gentleman, with the air and counte|nance of which Lucinda felt her&s;elf much impre&s;|&s;ed, and frequently noticed to her mother the e|legance of the figure, and how ably the painter had di&s;played his art.</P>
<P>As the child grew up, her beauty became eve|ry day more apparent; and it was manife&s;t that the &s;trength of her under&s;tanding, and the good|ne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and genero&s;ity of her di&s;po&s;i|tion mu&s;t, in her riper years, give additional force and lu&s;tre to the charms of her per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="034525_0168_0FFE1AF8AE0E4498">
But in the world in which we live, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;o good, &s;o generous a deed, &s;hould entirely e&s;cape the in&s;inuations of the mean, or the cen&s;ures of the malignant. The tea-table tattlers, Mi&s;s Vapid, Mi&s;s Re&s;tle&s;s, Mi&s;s Prattle, and Mi&s;s Sneer, met on the occa&s;ion, and decreed, <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m. con.</HI> that there was &s;omething prodigiou&s;ly dark and &s;u&s;picious in the tran&s;ac|tion; that it was mon&s;trou&s;ly incredible that any young lady &s;hould maintain a child from mere good nature, tenderne&s;s, or genero&s;ity; and on the breaking up of their convention, immortal &s;candals &s;tretched their eagle wings, and it &s;oon became the firm, un&s;haken creed of the fa&s;hiona|ble go&s;&s;ips of the village, that Lucinda had deign|ed to lie privately in, and that the child &s;he pro|tected and cheri&s;hed was no other than her own.</P>
<P>As Lucinda's per&s;onal and mental accompli&s;h|ments had given much &s;ecret offence to many of her female acquaintances, the de&s;truction of her character became a delicious treat to them, and more than one gentleman of fortune, who was on the point of making honorable and advanta|geous propo&s;als to Lucinda, were deterred from it by the&s;e buzzing &s;landers. Still, however, &s;he remained firm; &s;he &s;till treated the child as her &s;i&s;ter or daughter; deigned to give no an&s;wer to the ba&s;e in&s;inuations of little minds; nor would &s;he as her mother wi&s;hed, con&s;ent to leave the place where &s;uch ba&s;e reports had been circu|lated.</P>
<P>In the mean time, ten long years had rolled a|way, and Lucinda had not even received any &s;e|rious
<PB N="166" REF="034525_0169_0FFE1AFA3A5CA0C8">
offers of marriage; and as &s;he was now eight and twenty, tho her charms yet &s;hone in all their lu&s;tre, her envious rivals enjoyed their tri|umph, and began to hope the time approaching, when they might confer on her the title of Old Maid.</P>
<P>About this time it chanced that a Mr. Horton, a gentleman who had gone out to India &s;ome years before, and very rapidly made a fortune, returning home to enjoy the fruits of his good &s;ucce&s;s in his native country, purcha&s;ed a hou&s;e and e&s;tate in the neighborhood of the village in which Lucinda and her mother re&s;ided. He met with Lucinda at the a&s;&s;embly, and being plea&s;ed with her conver&s;ation, made &s;everal vi&s;its to her and her mother. Lucinda had remarked, the fir&s;t time &s;he &s;aw him, the &s;trong re&s;emblance there was between his features and tho&s;e of the portrait &s;he had found on the de&s;erted Laura, for by that name &s;he had called the child &s;he had found and protected: and this re&s;emblance excit|ed in her brea&s;t a kind of e&s;teem for him, before &s;he became acquainted with the good qualites of his heart and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But the &s;candalous reports that had been &s;o long circulated to the di&s;credit of Lucinda, were in|du&s;triou&s;ly tran&s;mitted to Mr. Horton's ear; the con&s;equence of which was, that his vi&s;its became much le&s;s frequent, and his behaviour to that la|dy &s;en&s;ibly different from what it had hitherto been.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="034525_0170_0FFE1AFD17814DB0">
Lucinda, now, for the fir&s;t time, felt that the venomed &s;hafts of &s;lander could reach her, and de&s;troy her peace tho Mr. Horton had too much politene&s;s to give even the &s;lighte&s;t hint of the cau&s;e of the alteration in his behaviour towards her, &s;he ea&s;ily conceived from what &s;ource it aro&s;e, and the fir&s;t opportunity that pre&s;ented, related to him with equal candor and emotion, the &s;tory of her finding the child, and the &s;ub&s;e|quent attacks made on her character by malicious &s;candal. This &s;he declared, and declared with the truth, was the fir&s;t time &s;he had felt any pain from the&s;e in&s;inuations, and the fir&s;t time &s;he had ever attempted to defend her&s;elf, and &s;he had on|ly done it now becau&s;e &s;he could not bear to lo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of a gentleman, of who&s;e good &s;en&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> too high an opinion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me he would li&s;ten for a moment to &s;uch fal&s;e and malicius &s;ugge&s;tions, when he had heard the truth. She ended by &s;howing him the picture &s;he had found with the child.</P>
<P>Mr. Horton viewed the picture with equal &s;ur|pri&s;e and emotion; he in&s;tantly knew it for his own portrait, and the child for his own daugh|ter. "Madam," &s;aid he, "your innocence is apparent indeed; &s;uffer me to confe&s;s my folly and my fault. This picture is my portrait; it has marks on it which preclude all doubt, and your Laura is my daughter. Before I went to In|dia, I had a connection (not greatly to my ho|nor) with a woman of mean character, by whom I had this child. I left with her what money I

could &s;pare, and made &s;everal remittances; but could never learn what become of her. Since my return I have made every enquiry, but have only been able to learn that &s;oon after I left her, &s;he went to live with &s;ome fellow of a character &s;imi|lar to her own, and has not been heard of &s;ince. It is probable they abandoned the child as an em|barra&s;&s;ment. Your tenderne&s;s and generous kind|ne&s;s have pre&s;erved it! and if I am &s;o fortunate as to be agreeable to you, my hand, my fortune, and my heart, &s;hall be yours."</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after, Lucinda was married to Mr. Horton, and, triumphing over every &s;canda|lous &s;ugge&s;tion, became, by law, the mother of her adopted child.</P>

In the plenitude of unoppo&s;ed power, he became notorious for tho&s;e acts of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion, which rendered his unhappy va&s;&s;als ever unea&s;y and in&s;ecure, even in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;imple rights of na|ture.</P>
<P>On the verge of his ample dominions, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant and intricate rece&s;s of an exten&s;ive and gloomy fore&s;t, the oppre&s;&s;ed Edmund&mdash;tho de&s;cended from a long race of worthy Britons&mdash;fixed his humble re&s;idence, removed as far as po&s;|&s;ible from the vicinage of his imperious lord, to whom he failed not to pay due homage and cu&s;to|mary tribute.

Yet cruel de&s;tiny waited to inflict a deep|er wound on the peace of Edmund! Dru&s;illa, the adored partner of his bed, was confe&s;&s;edly one of the mo&s;t lovely women of her day: in her, to a beautiful face, an intelligent mind, and a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, were united a &s;uperiority of fi|gure, and the mo&s;t exact &s;ymmetry of features&mdash;

<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The fame of this accompli&s;hed female could not fail to reach and intere&s;t the ear of &s;uch a vo|luptuary as Harold. By his authoritative com|mand, the fair victim was torn from the arms of her di&s;tracted hu&s;band, in order to gratify the lawle&s;s appetite of that tyrant. On her arrival at the ca&s;tle, the beauties of her per&s;on and the firmne&s;s of her behavior, impre&s;&s;ed a kind of re|verential awe and a&s;toni&s;hment on all who &s;aw her. Such dauntle&s;s and intripid virtue con|founded even Harold him&s;elf, who &s;ought in vain to win her to his de&s;ires, by the mo&s;t &s;pecious arts and &s;eductive promi&s;es, determining, if po&s;&s;ible, to conciliate her favor by kind and gentle means, rather than force her inclination by au&s;terity and violence. Day after day he repeated his inter|views, and redoubled his fruitle&s;s &s;olicitations; during which time &s;he experienced the greate&s;t marks of re&s;pect, and was allowed every indul|gence,

&s;ave that of liberty, and the &s;ociety of a beloved hu&s;band, who&s;e de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r idea was ever pre|&s;ent to her mind, and tho&s;e who&s;e fate &s;he mourn|ed with incon&s;olable angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the generous Edwin, unknown to Dru&s;illa, with great difficulty and danger, had found means to give information to Edmund, and concert a &s;cheme for the delivery of the fair cap|tive. Many of the guard were in his intere&s;t; and, as their lord was held in equal dete&s;tation, many others waited only for an opportunity to do ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, their friends, and their country, by launching the bolt of vengeance on the devoted head of the common enemy.</P>
<P>Edmund was much e&s;teemed by the little cir|cle of his friends; and, fired with re&s;entment for the injuries he had &s;u&s;tained, they vowed to e&s;|pou&s;e the cau&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t his enterprize.</P>
<P>Things at the ca&s;tle now began to wear a more &s;erious a&s;pect. Impatient of repeated repul&s;es in his illicit pur&s;uit, Harold, growing irritated and enraged, commanded Dru&s;illa to be confined to the dungeon, with a view to enforce that com|pliance, which kindne&s;s and artifice had attempt|ed in vain; and &s;he was given to under&s;tand, that he had fixed a time, beyond which his forbear|ance would be no longer dallied with.</P>
<P>The important day, de&s;tined for the &s;acrifice of virtue, at length arrived. Dru&s;illa had pre|pared her&s;elf for the i&s;&s;ue. She had concealed, under her flowing robe, a daggar which &s;he had

<P>SERENA Granville, with a figure lovely as if formed by the fingers of Love, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind fraught with every accompli&s;hment, of the mo&s;t refined and delicate ta&s;te. To the&s;e beauties, &s;he added the fa&s;cinating charms of a faultle&s;s temper, and a height of &s;pirits, &s;ome|times ari&s;ing almo&s;t to an exce&s;s. Whenever &s;he moved, &s;he attracted and fixed the wandering eyes of the beholders; whenever &s;he &s;poke, &s;he enchanted the &s;en&s;es, and won the hearts of her hearers. Among the train of her numerous ad|mirers, none &s;hone &s;o greatly pre-eminent, for the graces of his figure, and the beauties of his
<PB N="178" REF="034525_0181_0FFE1B1E14533770">
mind, as the youthful Frederick Cavendi&s;h. The &s;oul of Serena was above affectation. She de&s;|pi&s;ed the cruel de&s;poti&s;m of tyrannizing over a generous heart; and &s;he he&s;itated not to confe&s;s the power which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her bo&s;om. For family-rea&s;ons, two months were to elap&s;e before the day could be appointed for their union. During the intermediate time, a party was form|ed for the theatre: Cavendi&s;h held a commi&s;&s;ion in the guards; and, &s;ome unexpected military bu&s;ine&s;s occurring, it prevented him from attend|ing his fair <HI>Amante</HI> to Drury Lane. But Lady Granville wi&s;hed not to be di&s;appointed; and therefore, with her daughter, and niece Julia Cecil, &s;he went alone. During the play, Mi&s;s Cecil ob&s;erved an elegant young man, in naval uniform, enter the next box: &s;he pointed him out to Serena, who&s;e eyes encountered his as &s;he gaz|ed on his lovely countenance. The accident em|barra&s;&s;ed her, and &s;he ha&s;tily looked down. At the <HI>finale</HI> of the after-p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ece, a gentleman entered their box; who, &s;uddenly &s;pringing from his &s;eat, and &s;tretching over, &s;hook the young officer cor|dially by the hand, exclaiming&mdash;"Ha, Richard Wade! what brot you here? Where are you?"&mdash;"At St. James's Hotel, where I hope you will &s;up with me." His friend con&s;ented, and they both &s;prung out of the box. "A young puppy!" exclaimed Serena. "not to give us one parting glance!"&mdash;"Never mind," interrupted her cou|&s;in; "they are not worth wi&s;hing for."</P>
<P>When the two girls arrived at home, and had entered their own chamber, from a critique on

the actors, their di&s;cour&s;e fell, in&s;en&s;ibly, on the charms of the graceful &s;ailor. They admired his uncommon beauty; and laughed at each other, for the little notice which he appeared to have ta|ken of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ither. "I would venture my life," cri|ed Serena, "that he is a conceited fellow; a creature who can admire none but him&s;elf. I have a &s;trong inclination to play him a trick."&mdash;"How do you mean? you do not know him."&mdash;"That is of no con&s;equence. I will write to him, that I am violently in love with him, &amp;c. &amp;c. &s;ub&s;cribe a fal&s;e name; and de&s;ire him to direct to the Salopian Coffeehou&s;e, where my &s;ervant &s;hall call for his reply."&mdash;"Good heavens, Sere|na! what an in&s;tanteneous arrangement! You are &s;urely not &s;erious?"&mdash;"Yes, &s;erious as when I &s;hall my give hand to Frederick, and vow to be his for ever, I will write the letter this moment:" She &s;eized a pen, and immediately began to &s;crib|ble. Julia was thunder&s;truck. "What is your intention? The young man will certainly an&s;wer your letter."&mdash;"That is what I want. I will re|ply again; and &s;o on, till I have worked him up almo&s;t to madne&s;s with curio&s;ity! and then I throw away my quill, and leave him like an a|mazed knight, dropped by the fairies in a wilder|ne&s;s. Di&s;covery is impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>When &s;he had fini&s;hed her epi&s;tle, &s;he read it to her friend. It contained an eloquent avowal of a fervent attachment, which &s;he could no longer conceal; that her heart, hand, and fortune wait|ed his acceptance; and that &s;he &s;hould anticipate, with trembling anxiety, his reply, addre&s;&s;ed to

Mi&s;s Lucretia Manners, to be left at the Salopi|an Coffeehou&s;e. In vain were all the remon|&s;trances of Mi&s;s Cecil again&s;t the imprudence and dangers of this &s;cheme. Her cou&s;in per&s;i&s;t|ed in her de&s;ign; declaring, that it was only a frolic; and there could no evil con&s;equences en|&s;ue, as he could never find them out; and they would &s;urely not be &s;uch fools as to betray their own &s;ecret. Accordingly, the next morning, &s;he &s;ent off her <HI>billet-d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uxe,</HI> directed to Richard Wade, E&s;q. St. James's Hotel.</P>
<P>The following day, at noon, &s;he ordered her &s;ervant to call at the Salopian, and inquire for a letter, addre&s;&s;ed as &s;he had de&s;ired. The two girls, from different motives, were equally anx|ious for the return of the footman. At la&s;t he entered, and gave into the impatient hands of his young lady the wi&s;hed-for &s;croll. When he left the room, &s;he tore open the &s;eal, and peru&s;|ed, with a greedy eye; then read, with a voice almo&s;t &s;uffocated with laughter, a long &s;tring of rhap&s;odies. He commenced with an inundation of prai&s;es of genero&s;ity of her di&s;po&s;ition, that could &s;o nobly bur&s;t thro the di&s;graceful &s;hackles bound round her &s;ex, by the united efforts of all mankind, to render him happy by the confe&s;&s;ion of a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o flattering to his warme&s;t wi&s;hes. He concluded by &s;aying, that if the beauty of her per&s;on but half equalled the charms of the mind which dictated her letter, he &s;hould for ever e&s;|teem it the mo&s;t bli&s;sful moment of his life that pre&s;ented him to her view. He ended by re|que&s;ting as immediate interview. Serena was
<PB N="181" REF="034525_0184_0FFE1B26ADDF39A0">
mad with joy at the &s;ucce&s;s of her plot, and in|&s;tantly &s;at down to &s;cribble an an&s;wer. Julia a|gain urged her to de&s;i&s;t; but all to no purpo&s;e: &s;he would plague him yet a little longer. In this imprudent conduct &s;he continued for near a fort|night, writing and receiving letters every day; and, in almo&s;t every one of them, inventing new excu&s;es for denying a per&s;onal conver&s;ation. Richard Wade's impatience, in each &s;ucceeding epi&s;tle, increa&s;ed &s;o much, that he could hardly find rea&s;ons for her refu&s;als, which could appear of any con&s;equence, as in his replies &s;he had ar|guments to combat, and conquer them all. Mi&s;s Cecil grew more alarmed; and begged her, for Heaven's &s;ake, to give it up; for &s;he dreaded the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable effects, &s;hould it be di&s;|covered: but Serena was ob&s;tinate, declared that it was impo&s;&s;ible, and continued the corre&s;pon|dence.</P>
<P>One morning, when Mi&s;s Granville &s;at alone in the drawing-room, waiting the return of her &s;er|vant from the Salopian, &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly fell into a reverie; and, leaning her blooming cheek on her white arm, which re&s;ted on the &s;opha, her thots wandered from the anticipation of that day which was &s;oon to give her to her dear Frederick, to the elegant &s;ailor, and his di&s;appointment, when &s;he &s;hould drop an&s;wering his letters. At this moment, the gentle Cavendi&s;h entered; he had &s;tolen the fir&s;t in&s;tant from military duty, to &s;pend a few bli&s;sful minutes in the &s;ociety of his adored Serena. He approached her unperceiv|ed;
<PB N="182" REF="034525_0185_0FFE1B28352197D0">
and, tenderly taking her hand, in a voice, &s;weet as the &s;ofte&s;t &s;igh of love, demanded what was the &s;ubject of her reflections. She &s;tarted at the &s;ound of his loved accents, and blu&s;hed at the que&s;tion. The idea that any other man than him&s;elf &s;hould for one in&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;s her thots, &s;truck a chill to her heart: the vivid glow of &s;hame, which diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over her cheek, fla&s;h|ed a ray of truth on her under&s;tanding; and her &s;oul acknowledged, with gratitude and &s;elf-re|proach, the rejected remon&s;trances of her friend.</P>
<P>As the heavenly orbs of Frederick were bent on her's with ineffable tenderne&s;s, he beheld with wonder and angui&s;h, the confu&s;ion into which his que&s;tion appeared to have thrown her. "Have I given you pain, my Serena? I was impertinent; but, believe me, I did not intend it. Will you pardon me?" He pre&s;&s;ed her hand, to give force to his a&s;&s;evaration. "I have nothing to pardon; you did not hurt me: I was only a&s;hamed to &s;peak the truth; for I was realy thinking of no|thing." She blu&s;hed &s;till deeper, as &s;he uttered this fal&s;ehood, and ca&s;t her eyes down to conceal her embarra&s;&s;ment. The penetrating orbs of Cavendi&s;h were fixed on her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: he ob&s;erved its changes with an unaccountable angui&s;h; and uncon&s;ciou&s;ly drooping her hand, with a deep &s;igh, ro&s;e from his chair, and advanced to the window. At this in&s;tant, the door bur&s;t open, and a young man ru&s;hing in, flung his him&s;elf at the feet of Mi&s;s Granville, exclaiming&mdash;"Have I found my my&s;terious love! By Heaven, no earth|ly power &s;hall tear your lovely form from this
<PB N="183" REF="034525_0186_0FFE1B2CA145F1C0">
faithful bo&s;om!" Suddenly ri&s;ing, he cla&s;ped her to his brea&s;t. Cavendi&s;h, who &s;tood petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation, now ru&s;hed for|ward; and, &s;eizing Wade by the arm, rudely pulled him from his hold, and demanded who he was.</P>
<P>"This lady's lover and protector, Sir," repli|ed he, in a threatening tone. Serena, wild and dumb with terror, threw her&s;elf into the arms of Frederick; who &s;mothering his pa&s;&s;ion cried&mdash;"You are certainly mad, Sir! This is a woman of virtue, and my betrothed wife; I therefore de&s;ire you to leave this hou&s;e in&s;tantly." "No, Sir, I &s;hall not, without &s;he accompanies me. I have letters under her own hand, declaring her love for me, and her abhorrence of all other men. She will not deny it; but I &s;uppo&s;e, you are the per&s;ecuting coward &s;he complains of." The azure eyes of Cavendi&s;h &s;ta&s;hed all heaven's lightings; he ca&s;t the frantic Serena from his arm; and ru&s;hing forward&mdash;"Intruding, in&s;olent villain! your blood &s;hall blot the fal&s;ehood." So &s;aying, he drew, and made a furious pa&s;s at him with his &s;word. Wade expected it; and, parrying the thru&s;t, made a lounge at him, and ran him thro the &s;ide. The unfortunate Frederick fell; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he advanced to Serena, who &s;tood rivetted like a &s;tatue of De&s;pair. "Come, my Lucretia! let us fly this place, my life is in danger." "Mon&s;ter! murderer!" &s;creamed &s;he; and giving him a vi|olent pu&s;h from her, threw him to the ground, and flew &s;hrieking out of the room. In this fall, he &s;tumbled over a part of Frederick's &s;word, as it leaned again&s;t the lifele&s;s form of its ma&s;ter.
<PB N="184" REF="034525_0187_0FFE1B2F7966D6E8">
before he could recover him&s;elf, it ran him quite thro the thigh; and he dropped, bleeding and faint, be&s;ide the body of him he had &s;lain. All the horrors of his &s;ituation ru&s;hed on his mind. He knew not him he had killed&mdash;perhaps an in|jured man; and he had forfeited his own life for, perhaps, an abandoned woman!</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> In a few minutes, the room was crowded with people. Julia flew into the apartment; and, &s;eeing the breathle&s;s form of Cavendi&s;h on the floor, and near him the young &s;ailor bleeding to death, an explanation of the whole affair ru&s;hed on her memory. She flung her&s;elf between the two bodies; and, tearing off her white drapery, attempted to &s;taunch the wounds of both; while &s;he be&s;ought, for God's &s;ake, that &s;ome one would fly for a &s;urgeon. Her commands were in|&s;tantly obeyed. Serena was held in a &s;tate of madne&s;s at the door, by her mother and two &s;er|vants, begging that &s;he might be &s;uffered to go in, and die on the bo&s;om of her Frederick. The &s;urgeon arriving, ordered <HI>her</HI> to her cham|ber&mdash;to which &s;he was hurried, raving of her folly and mi&s;ery&mdash;and immediately proceeded to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the two unfortunate officers. Mr. Wade was yet &s;en&s;ible; the bandages of Mi&s;s Cecil had &s;topped the effu&s;ion of blood: but poor Cavendi&s;h lay without motion or &s;en&s;ation. As the &s;urgeon advanced to the &s;ide of the young &s;ailor, he by a &s;trong exertion repul&s;ed him, and begged that he would fir&s;t examine the wound of his antagoni&s;t, which he hoped was not mortal. Mr. A&mdash;obeyed his de&s;ires; and, ordering the
<PB N="185" REF="034525_0188_0FFE1B325542F288">
&s;ervants to lay Cavendi&s;h on the &s;opha, command|ed every one, but his own a&s;&s;i&s;tants, to leave the room. When the &s;urgeon had examined and dre&s;&s;ed the wounds of the young men, he &s;aw them carefully put to bed, and ordered them to be kept in profound quiet. As he was going down &s;tairs, Lady Granville, in a &s;tate of di&s;|traction, &s;ent for him into her <HI>boudoir,</HI> and in|treated him to tell her if there were any hopes for Mr. Cavendi&s;h. Mr. A&mdash;&s;aid he would not flatter her: his wound was not mortal; but his lo&s;s of blood had been &s;o great, that the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences might be expected. "But the other gentleman, (continued he), if he is kept free from a fever, will certainly recover." "Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> other gentleman, (replied &s;he), I know nothing about. Indeed, I am ignorant of the whole af|fair. My daughter flew into my chamber, &s;creaming&mdash;"He is killed! Cavendi&s;h is kil|led!" and this is all I know of the terrible &s;cene, as &s;he has ever &s;ince been in a &s;tate of delirium. At the&s;e words, the phy&s;ician, who had been &s;ent for to Serena, while Mr. A&mdash;was with her lo|ver, entered the room, and told Lady Granville that her daughter was in a high fever, and mu&s;t be kept compo&s;ed, el&s;e he could not an&s;wer for her life.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety things con|tinue for three days. Mi&s;s Cecil, who knew well the thotle&s;s tran&s;action of her co&s;in, imagined too truly the cau&s;e of this fatal cata&s;trophe; and, while all the parties yet lived, &s;he earne&s;tly

&s;ought an opportunity of explaining &s;o &s;ad a my&s;|tery. She tenderly loved her friend: &s;he mourn|ed the wild vivacity of di&s;po&s;ition that had &s;educ|ed her into &s;o imprudent an action; and her heart was wrung with agony for her pre&s;ent, and if &s;he lived future &s;ufferings. The in&s;inuating gen|tlene&s;s of Frederick Cavendi&s;h had made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion on her e&s;teem, not to draw down the bitter tears from her eyes, when &s;he contem|plated his unhappy fate. But the beautiful, the deceived Wade! when his lovely idea &s;hot acro&s;e her di&s;tracted fancy, her whole &s;oul was torn with torture: the thot of his dying, of his recover|ing, and of that recovery's di&s;graceful, horrid con&s;equences, almo&s;t bereft her of her rea&s;on; and, impelled by the angui&s;h of the moment, &s;he flew to the entrance of his apartment, with what de&s;ign &s;he knew not. As &s;he gently opened the door, &s;he found that he was in a profound &s;lumber; and, commanding the nur&s;e to go and lay down for a few hours, promi&s;ed to watch by her charge till her return. She remained near half an hour in the room; Richard awaking from his &s;leep, and heaving a deep &s;igh, &s;tretched forth his arm and drew a&s;ide the curtain. When his dark eyes met tho&s;e of Mi&s;s Cecil, he felt an unu&s;ual emotion at his brea&s;t: an emotion of gra|titude, hope, and dread.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e; and, gently advancing nearer to him, inquired in a tremblig voice&mdash;which too plainly expre&s;&s;ed the intere&s;t which &s;he took in his &s;ituation&mdash;how he found him&s;elf. He replied, that he was better than he wi&s;hed to be; for the
<PB N="187" REF="034525_0190_0FFE1B36F46B8E40">
feelings of his mind were more than he could endure with fortitude. "If my adver&s;ary dies," continued he, "and I &s;urvive, even &s;hould I e&s;|cape the puni&s;hment of the law, I &s;hall over be wretched at the recollection of &s;o dreadful an ef|fect of my credulity and ra&s;hne&s;s." He was pro|ceeding to give Mi&s;s Cecil a narrative of the cor|re&s;pondence between him and Mi&s;s Granville; fir&s;t, expre&s;&s;ing his anxiety and doubts about the my&s;tery which enveloped the whole affair; when Julia interrupted him, by &s;aying, that &s;he knew it to well, and long ago had warned her cou&s;in of its evil effects. "But," continued &s;he, "had I felt the di&s;tant foreboding of this its fatal con|clu&s;ion. I would have u&s;ed commands, in&s;tead of entreaties, to have &s;topped the deception." "De|ception! How, Madam, was it deception? Sure|ly I am a &s;tranger to your friend! What could be her meaning?" "An idle frolic, without de&s;ign or end, but to entertain her&s;elf. She thot to a|mu&s;e her whim&s;ical moments with an adventure, which certainly was innocent, tho imprudent. She conceived, that &s;he could lay it a&s;ide when|ever &s;he plea&s;ed; but, alas! how agonizingly otherwi&s;e has been its termination!"&mdash;Agoniz|ing, indeed!

He caught her hand; and, fervently pre&s;&s;ing it, &s;he darted out of the room, the &s;oft touch of his hand thrilling to her inmo&s;t &s;oul. In the evening, &s;he &s;ent up her af|fectionate compliments to Mr. Cavendi&s;h; and, if he would admit her, &s;he would be happy to watch an hour by him alone.

He laid his burning hand on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ers; and gazed at her with an expre&s;&s;ion that

needed no explanation: it penetrated to her heart, and &s;he, bur&s;t into tears. Recovering her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid, "Mr. Cavendi&s;h, will you&mdash;can I hope for your pardon? I have been, in a great part, the cau&s;e of the di&s;mal &s;cene that is now before me." "You, Julia! How? For Heaven's &s;ake, explain; and either di&s;&s;ipate my &s;u&s;picions, or convince me they are true, and end my tortures by killing me. O! is Serena unwor|thy of my love?" Mi&s;s Cecil, with a faultering voice, interrupted by many &s;howers of tears, re|vealed the whole tran&s;action; only a little alter|ing the truth, by as much as po&s;&s;ible meliorating the folly of her friend, and taking the blame on her&s;elf. When &s;he ended, the dejected orbs of Frederick beamed with renovated radiance; he cla&s;ped his hands in an exta&s;y of joy. "O! my God, I thank thee! Julia, my kind friend! fly to my unhappy Serena: tell her that I forgive her; &s;peak peace to her &s;uffering &s;oul; and tell her to live for me. To know that my dear girl is innocent, and yet fondly loves me, has infu&s;ed new life into my dying frame. Fly, my dear Ju|lia, and render your &s;weet friend as happy as my|&s;elf!" She ro&s;e, her eyes overflowing with tears of rapture; and, advancing to the door, turned back two or three &s;teps, and faintly breathed, in a trembling voice, "And may I not al&s;o tell the unfortunate Wade, that you forgive the ra&s;hne&s;s which, endangering your exi&s;tence, has brot him|&s;elf to the verge of the grave?" "Yes, Julia; tell him every thing that you would wi&s;h me to &s;ay."</P>

Julia flew to the chamber of Mi&s;s Granville: her delirium was &s;ub&s;ided; but it had left on her languid frame a &s;low fever, and on her mind a deep and &s;ettled melancholy. Mi&s;s Cecil, with &s;ome difficulty, gained her cou&s;in's attention. Nowith&s;tanding her utmo&s;t precaution, the un|expected and bli&s;sful intelligence rendered her al|mo&s;t frantic with joy. Nothing now was want|ing, but the recovery of all parties, to make them perfectly happy. A few weeks gave once more &s;trength to their limbs, and beauty to their features: Health ca&s;t her dazzling rays around their forms; &s;o powerful an effect had the &s;ereni|ty of their minds over the compo&s;ure of their frames.

<HEAD>HISTORY OF MARIA FEODOROVNA.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A YOUNG RUSSIAN COUNTESS.</HEAD>
<P>VIRGIN innocence is an inchanted tower; its &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts more in that awful re&s;|pect which the fight of it creates in the brea&s;ts of virtuous men, than in its innate fortitude. Tho&s;e brea&s;ts which po&s;&s;e&s;s no re&s;pect for virtue, tho&s;e men who inherit no regard for honor, are the daring a&s;&s;ailants. The charms they employ to break the enchantments, are flattery, fal&s;e|hood, prote&s;tations to the Deity to witne&s;s <HI>their love!</HI> The &s;pell &s;ucceeds: the tower, with all its gilded turrets, &s;hakes, and tumbles in ruins!</P>
<P>Let me behold the con&s;equences of this crimi|nal conduct. A lovely daughter is brot up un|der the care of, what is commonly called, the fonde&s;t parents. She is deluded under the pro|mi&s;e of marriage, or, allow that the delu&s;ion &s;ucceeded without &s;uch promi&s;e: the fond pa|rents tear their hair and weep bitterly; but
<PB N="193" REF="034525_0196_0FFE1B4B1B1FE8A0">
they order their daughter to be driven from the hou&s;e. They weep for the di&s;honor that has hap|pened to their name; and to cure this di&s;honor they &s;pread the infamy; and drive out their de&s;|cendent to repeat the crime.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the counte&s;s, is not &s;ufficiently known. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> contains an awfully intere&s;ting le&s;&s;on to parents, and di&s;plays the fatal effects of a ri|gorous treatment of their offspring. It was the apprehen&s;ion of a rigorous treatment from a pa|rent of a violent temper that occa&s;ioned the mi|&s;eries of Maria Feodorovna. She was a lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and fortune, the only daugh|ter of a nobleman.</P>
<P>During the early period of her life, her edu|cation was anxiou&s;ly attended to by the be&s;t of mothers, who&s;e &s;oul bore upon it the impre&s;&s;ion of every noble feeling and virtue. The mother, while &s;he held her favorite daughter before the gla&s;s, &s;aw an exact copy of her&s;elf in form of body; and the never-cea&s;ing &s;mile upon the cheeks and lips of Maria &s;eemed to be&s;peak an equally beautiful copy of her mind. The mo|ther died: and the youthful Ru&s;&s;ian counte&s;s, from the love and care of her mother, from the polite and elegant round of a court, and from the &s;ociety of her dear Markoff, who was enrap|tured with this amiable female, was hurried by the haughty baron to a di&s;tant e&s;tate amid the wilds of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="034525_0197_0FFE1B4CC7BB9D40">
Here, &s;urrounded with de&s;erts, nor viewing one object that could bring &s;ome happy compari|&s;on in thot between them and pa&s;t &s;cenes, the lovely Maria exhau&s;ted her bo&s;om in &s;obs, and watered her pillow with tears.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety of count Markoff could have lighted up this de&s;ert, and di&s;pelled tho&s;e tears. Di&s;appointed ambition had occa&s;ioned a mi&s;un|der&s;tanding between the two families, and the name of Markoff was forbid even to be mention|ed in the hou&s;e of the baron. His fondne&s;s for his lovely daughter could not overcome his ab|horrence of his &s;ucce&s;sful rival, the father of young Markoff; nor permit him to entertain the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of that connection which he knew was the ardent wi&s;h of the youthful pair. His brows darkened with rage, when he &s;aw one of his blood who wi&s;hed not de&s;truction to the hou&s;e of Markoff.</P>
<P>Maria was kept in perpetual agony by this unfortunate di&s;po&s;ition in her parent, yet forced to affect an indifference to all &s;he loved, while &s;he daily drooped and pined in &s;ilent melancholy. But no affectation could bring back the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> health which had lately painted her cheeks; and her languid &s;miles and action were di&s;ea&s;ed co|pies of that lively manner which had di&s;tingui&s;h|ed her in happier days. The innocent mirth, un+mixed with care, born in the lap of childhood, and expiring with it, was never again to return. Maria was not even de&s;tined to enjoy that hap|pine&s;s to which her virtue entitled her. In vain
<PB N="195" REF="034525_0198_0FFE1B4E4F2C8580">
had a mother in&s;pired her with every noble and virtuous &s;entiment; in vain had nature endowed her with a per&s;on the model of beauty, and with an exalted &s;oul; in vain had fortune lavi&s;hed riches, exten&s;ive domains, and thou&s;ands of &s;laves ready to kneel at her feet whenever &s;he appeared.&mdash;The meane&s;t of the&s;e &s;laves was to po&s;&s;es Ma|ria.</P>
<P>Count Markoff, di&s;regarding every dictate but that of love, and the dangers which Maria had repre&s;ented to him as the certain con&s;equen|ces of any attempt to vi&s;it her, left his re&s;idence near Mo&s;cow, and journeyed toward that &s;pot, which was to give him an interview with his lovely angel. Di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of a pea|&s;ant, he arrived within &s;ight of the baron's pa|lace, and &s;aw the roof which contained within it all his heart panted for! The brea&s;t of Markoff until this in&s;tant felt not the idea of di&s;appoint|ment: a &s;oldier, he had been accu&s;tomed to cut his way thro every difficult pa&s;s with his &s;word. The parent of Maria guarded the avenue he was now approaching.</P>
<P>With money he purcha&s;ed the &s;ervices of &s;ome per&s;ons who frequented the baron's hou&s;e. He got, by their means, a letter conveyed to Maria. Upon reading this epi&s;tle, love overcame in her too every dictate of prudence; &s;he lo&s;t recollec|tion of her father being at that in&s;tant in the hou&s;e; and hurrying on her cloak, &s;he ran down &s;tairs, and into the fields then covered with &s;now. Her recollection returned&mdash;her heart
<PB N="196" REF="034525_0199_0FFE1B53D3B08AE8">
failed within her&mdash;her limbs refu&s;ed to do their office&mdash;&s;he &s;tood trembling before the wintry &s;torm! She called to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance a &s;lave; and pretending &s;ome other cau&s;e for her illne&s;s, was a&s;&s;i&s;ted to reach her chamber without the know|ledge of the awful parent who had occa&s;ioned her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Maria, overcome with grief, and now giving up every thot of viewing her beloved Markoff, &s;unk upon her bed in &s;its of de&s;pair and madne&s;s, Rea&s;on again re&s;umed her feat; a letter was di&s;|patched to Markoff at a neighboring village, de|&s;iring him, if he valued his own and her life, to leave the place, and return to Mo&s;cow, where there might be &s;till a po&s;&s;ibility of their meet|ing. Having &s;igned and &s;ealed this letter, &s;he held it in her hands, without know what &s;he did. She broke the &s;eal of her letter, and, &s;eizing the ardent pen, gave that utterance it afforded to her pa&s;&s;ion; and amid the effu&s;ians of ardent love &s;he mentioned the attempt &s;he had made to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Markoff's bo&s;om could not contain the emotions of his &s;oul on reading this letter. The cool, pru|dential, fir&s;t part was overturned by the conclud|ing po&s;t&s;cript.</P>
<P>Maria &s;tood at the window, looking toward the village. "No," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "he mu&s;t not come.&mdash;I have forbid him, as he values my life. Let me endeavor to compo&s;e my&s;elf. Having re&s;olved, and executed my re&s;olve by
<PB N="197" REF="034525_0200_0FFE1B5557838030">
that letter, we mu&s;t wait for a happier period, why this fever of de&s;ire in my &s;oul yet to behold him? I will avert my eyes from the village&mdash;Oh, how I &s;hake!&mdash;Can he leave me, and obey my mandate? Will he not &s;tand upon that &s;nowy plain, and wave his handkerchief? The village is &s;urrounded with woods&mdash;can Markoff be gone without making me one &s;ignal of love! Ungrate|ful man! No! no! no! Where am I? Did I hear him &s;peak? Maria! Markoff!"</P>
<P>The night clo&s;ed: the di&s;tracted Maria walk|ed in her chamber, &s;till &s;earching thro the gloom for Markoff&mdash;&s;till wi&s;hing to &s;ee, not him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rather &s;ome friendly &s;pirit bearing his &s;hape and air. A pea&s;ant near to the windows held out a letter. Maria anxiou&s;ly enquired, but with a &s;oft voice, from whom it came. It was the count Markoff him&s;elf! "Where is the count?" &s;aid Maria; and &s;tretching out her hand for the let+ter. "My Maria!" replied the count; and lay|ing hold of the branches of a tree which &s;tood near the window, he climbed up, and entered it.</P>
<P>The young lady &s;tared wildly at him, unable to refit or to &s;peak. He a&s;&s;ured her, he would in&s;tantly depart, when he had once impre&s;&s;ed up|on her lips the &s;eal of love. He threw his arms eagerly around her, and held her to his panting brea&s;t.&mdash;The hours glided away un&s;een; nor were they awakend from their dream, but with the &s;tepes of the baron approaching to the chamber door. The imagination of a woman, which
<PB N="198" REF="034525_0201_0FFE1B56DD4C80E8">
is ever quick, either to her relief, or to her di&s;|truction, &s;ugge&s;ted to Markoff to hide him&s;elf in an empty che&s;t, which happened to be in the room. The baron's vi&s;it was to enquire, as he often did, after his favorite child; as he had heard &s;omething of her indi&s;po&s;ition. At times, when the recollection of the family of Markoff was lo&s;t, he behaved as a fond father, but this dreadful recollection was never lo&s;t for a day's con|tinuance.</P>
<P>The baron left his daughter, without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the pre&s;ence of the &s;on of his rival.</P>
<P>Maria approached the fatal che&s;t. She opened it. The count was a&s;leep, or affected to &s;leep. He was a&s;leep, to wake no more! The head of the che&s;t had been in a hurried moment, &s;hut clo&s;e upon him, or had fallen &s;o. There remains no doubt that the count, upon feeling the incon|veniency, and want of air, could have relieved him&s;elf, and perhaps had gently attempted to do it; but finding his attempt attended with &s;ome noi&s;e, which might have betrayed a woman whom he valued more than life, to the rage of a father, he had &s;ummitted to death.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for the imagination to conceive the &s;ituation of Maria when &s;he found the lifele&s;s corp&s;e of Markoff! She continued for &s;ome time to believe that the count was affecting &s;leep, re|proached him for playing the fool. At la&s;t &s;he pulled him with &s;ome violence and anger: the body fell again into the che&s;t. She &s;creamed;
<PB N="199" REF="034525_0202_0FFE1B5B2A828D98">
and fortunate would it have been had the baron heard this cry of horror. Dreadful as her &s;itua|tion was, the idea of her father's wrath added to her mi&s;ery. Mad with agony, &s;he cla&s;ped the body of the count, calling upon his name, and, at calmer intervals, u&s;ing every endeavor to re&s;|tore him to life in vain.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of the night was di&s;turbed with the &s;ighs, the &s;hrieks of Maria, now re|clining upon the corp&s;e, now at her window tear|ing her hair, and imploring heaven to end her exi&s;tence. The morning began to dawn&mdash;&s;he rou&s;ed from her di&s;tracted melancholy, and thot|ful of what the light of day and her furious fa|ther were to di&s;cover. The &s;lave who is appoint|ed watchman to every hou&s;e thro out Ru&s;&s;ia is the only per&s;on readily to be procured during the night, and is generally and elderly man. He is employed in the meane&s;t offices during that part of the day not alloted to &s;leep.</P>
<P>To this wretched dome&s;tic, who&s;e lodging is a &s;ort of crib within the gates, the unfortunate Maria applied. The &s;lave at her coming kneel|ed, and touched her &s;hoe with his forehead, crav|ing her protection. She de&s;ired him to ri&s;e, and informed him he &s;hould have it, as well as a &s;um of money, if he would keep a &s;ecret, and faith|fully &s;erve her: &s;he di&s;covered her misfortunes, and de&s;ired that he would remove the corp&s;e, and bury it in the adjoining fore&s;t. The &s;lave felt a con&s;equence he had never felt before. She gave him money, but he knew that the baron would
<PB N="200" REF="034525_0203_0FFE1B5E0A82A4B0">
give him more to betray her. That &s;lave, who but a moment before had never dared to look up at the daughter of his lord, and who was accu&s;|tomed to e&s;teem both as deities. on whom his all, his very life depended: that wretch, who was happy to find a bed in the corner of her father's &s;table, and daily receiving cha&s;ti&s;ement from the care of his &s;urly ma&s;ter and fellow &s;ervants, who look down upon the watchman as an inferior be|ing, dared at once to po&s;&s;es the per&s;on of Maria! He began, without much ceremony, to u&s;e free|dom with the counte&s;s. Overpowered as &s;he was with de&s;pair and grief, &s;he &s;truck the villain: for a moment &s;he forgot her &s;orrows, and, re&s;uming the dignity of her rank, &s;he bade him begone. But it was too late: the &s;lave knew her &s;ecret, nor was they any other a&s;&s;i&s;tant to be had. The villain knew this: and, pretending to go to the baron to inform him, Maria called him back. He obeyed with &s;ullen importance. He took the &s;ilver and gold trinkets which &s;he now added to the fir&s;t pre&s;ent&mdash;he followed her toward her chamber&mdash;he &s;topped &s;uddenly, and &s;wore if &s;he did not come to his embraces, he would directly acquaint the baron with all. Maria, in her turn, fell upon her knees to the &s;lave: &s;he entreated and be&s;ought him, with every &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ion, and with a promi&s;e of freedom and wealth. She hold the &s;lave, while he endeavored to rid him|&s;elf in order to proceed to the baron's bed-room. She fainted in the &s;truggle to detain him.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="034525_0204_0FFE1B60E56C98D0">
The villain turned, beheld his prey, and &s;eized upon it.</P>
<P>The &s;avage re&s;orted to the chamber, where lay the corp&s;e of Markoff. He carried it to the woods, and cutting the throat, and otherways disfiguring it, left it a prey to animals le&s;s feroci|ous than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Maria awoke to a new &s;cene of woe. The baron ob&s;erved the melancholy brooding upon her mind, and gue&s;&s;ing that the cau&s;e related to the dete&s;ted family of Markoff, abu&s;ed her with his u&s;ual rudene&s;s. The &s;lave renewed his ad|dre&s;&s;es, and with the &s;ame threats of informing the baron, adding, that he would accu&s;e her of the murder of the count.</P>
<P>Maria, as yet guiltle&s;s, committed a fault un|becoming of her rank and innocence: but the ac|cu&s;ation again&s;t her is &s;olely for the want of forti|tude. A crime once committed, appears le&s;s hide|ous: this lady had as yet committed none; but &s;he knew of her di&s;grace, and felt her&s;elf degraded, and in her own eyes, an outca&s;t of &s;ociety. The &s;lave not only threatened to accu&s;e her of mur|der, but of pro&s;titution with count Markoff.</P>
<P>Maria might have perhaps got over the dread of her father's wrath; but the accu&s;ation of mur|der and pro&s;titution, not merely to the count, but to the vile&s;t of her father's dome&s;tics, was a &s;tumbling-block that &s;he had not &s;trength to pa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="034525_0205_0FFE1B63C452CBD8">
It is always dangerous to imagine our&s;elves pa&s;t recovery in any &s;ituation. To avoid a public, &s;he &s;ubmitted to a private &s;hame. Familiarity made the &s;lave now in&s;olent: he forced her even to come to his wretched hovel, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with contempt.</P>
<P>The wretched Maria never again beheld with a &s;mile the morning dawn. Her eyes dejected, her color pale; &s;he &s;tarted from her gla&s;s, and, throwing her clothes carele&s;&s;ly about her, &s;he &s;upported with pain, while with her father, the appearance of ea&s;e and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;lave to multiply his gains, dragged her to &s;ome neighboring cottage, where were gene|rally a&s;&s;embled, at the dead hour of night, &s;e|veral of the wealthy inhabitants of the country. The hour arrived when Maria was to be freed from contamination; and it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he had before entertained the idea of extri|cating her&s;elf, and this idea had &s;upported her &s;inking mind, and had prevented her too from freeing her&s;elf by &s;uicide. Reflection had paint|ed the &s;hameful cour&s;e that &s;he walked in, and &s;he &s;aw no end to her &s;orrows. The pride of rank, rou&s;ed with repeated in&s;ult, determined upon re|venge. Famale nature yet revolted, and &s;he al|lowed &s;everal opportunities to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The brutal ravi&s;hers formed them&s;elves into a club. Maria was the &s;acrifice at their fea&s;ts, and was treated with every &s;hameful indignity.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="034525_0206_0FFE1B654AB6D028">
The moment of vengeance at la&s;t comes. Her tyrants, overwhelmed with liquor, &s;lept npon the benches of the cottage. Maria &s;aw, and her good angel approved the period of freedom and ju&s;tice. She trembled as &s;he approached the &s;lave. She invoked Heaven to give her re&s;olution, and, pulling the knife from the belt of the &s;avage, plunged it into his heart. Her fortitude rekind|led with the &s;troke. She proceeded on to the o|ther villains, who belched their drunken fumes in their &s;lumbers, and planted a dagger in every brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Maria had no &s;ooner completed the work of vengeance, than &s;he fled home. She beheld from her windows the ri&s;ing &s;un, and &s;he imagined her&s;elf in a new world! "Mark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">off," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "will be here! The&s;e are the ely&s;ian fields: I will go out and met him." She wander|ed in the fore&s;t which covered his body. She knew the &s;pot, and kneeled upon his tomb. Her voice denied utterance; her tears watered his grave, and &s;he &s;trewed upon it her flaxen hair. Still awed by her father, &s;he concealed from him her &s;orrow, and affected ea&s;e and mirth.</P>
<P>The idea of having committed murder often threw her into fits of de&s;pair. She thot to ea&s;e her con&s;cience by making a confe&s;&s;ion to her prie&s;t.

<P>Tired of life, now that her &s;hame was public, &s;he would have preferred death to all other pro|tection.

<HEAD>ALBERT AND EMMA:</HEAD>
<HEAD>AN INTERESTING HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>IN a village in the &s;outh of France, lived a pea|&s;ant, who&s;e only wealth con&s;i&s;ted in tho&s;e mental po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which adorn greatne&s;s and dig|nify poverty. He had acquired, by his integri|ty and Indu&s;try, the approbation of the ma&s;ter whom he had long &s;erved as under-bailiff, and the e&s;teem of all his neighbors. In his hours of lei&s;ure, he delighted in the di&s;charge of his parental duty, by cultivating the native graces of an only child. Emma, at the age of eighteen, was lovely in her per&s;on, gentle in her manners, and virtuous in her principles. Their cottage was the &s;cene of ru&s;tic peace, and their little gar|den a bower of intermingled &s;weets.&mdash;Bernard had long &s;erved, with fidelity and zeal, the Mar|quis of Clairville, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;umptuous chateau, and exten&s;ive domains in the neighbour|hood.&mdash;Ju&s;tice, genero&s;ity, and innate excellence of heart, were his characteri&s;tics; and he was the idol of the &s;urrounding country.&mdash;Emma a&s;|&s;i&s;ted

her father's hone&s;t toils, by employing her|&s;elf in &s;pinning and netting, which contributed to acquire tho&s;e comforts, that rendered them happy and contented.</P>
<P>The duty and affection of Emma was unpa|ralleled: oft would &s;he climb the verdant &s;teep, or wander in the &s;ilent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to wait the return of her father from his daily labours, when the even|ing &s;un ca&s;ts its faint gleams upon the &s;ummer &s;cene.&mdash;Sometimes &s;eated by this venerable fire, &s;he di&s;cour&s;ed with him on the virtues of her de|parted mother, whom fate had &s;ummoned from the world in the early infancy of her daughter; and they &s;hed tears of &s;orrow and regret to her loved memory. Sometimes, in the &s;ea&s;ons of fe&s;|tivity, Emma would join in the rural dance with the villagers, or chaunt her melodious notes to the &s;oft flutes of the youthful pea&s;ants.</P>

<P>Such was the life led by Emma and her father; but they were &s;oon to experience a fatal calamity, in the death of the Marquis de Clairville, who&s;e lo&s;s was univer&s;ally lamented. For &s;ome days af|ter his di&s;ea&s;e, the eyes of his tenants and depen|dents cea&s;ed not to flow with tears of gratitude and &s;orrow. At the funeral of the Marquis,
<PB N="207" REF="034525_0210_0FFE1B726CC549D8">
conducted with all the pomp due to his rank, the inhabitants of the &s;urrounding hamlets attended; grief was imprinted on every countenance, as they followed the body in mute dejection. A young &s;tranger, returning to Swi&s;&s;erland from a tour, chanced to &s;trike out of the road as he ap|proached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> beauty of the long avenues which led to it. He reach|ed the gates ju&s;t as the mournful proce&s;&s;ion was beginning to move. Enquiring the name of the decea&s;ed, one of the pea&s;ants informed him, that in their ma&s;ter, the Marquis de Clairville, they had lo&s;t the be&s;t of lords, and mo&s;t generous of patrons; the tears which rolled down his cheeks as he &s;poke, gave evidence of his feelings: Al|bert di&s;mounted from his hor&s;e, and giving charge of it to his &s;ervant, mingled with the pea|&s;antry, and, moving &s;lowly, arrived with them at the church, about half a mile di&s;tant, where the remains of Clairville were to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> in the vault of his ance&s;tors. He placed him&s;elf near the grave: before the ceremony was ended, and while a &s;olemn dirge was chanting, he ob|&s;erved the mourners to fall back, and form on each &s;ide an opening, thro which he beheld ad|vancing a group of village maidens, with ba&s;|kets of flowers on their arms, which they &s;trew|ed in profu&s;ion over the coffin. Albert's atten|tion was &s;oon attracted toward the lovelie&s;t ob|ject he had ever beheld; &s;he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from her companions by a &s;uperior elegance of mien and grace of features, &s;he wore a ve&s;t of white &s;tuff, fitted to her &s;hape, and round her
<PB N="208" REF="034525_0211_0FFE1B73F0A55E80">
&s;lender wai&s;t was bound a &s;carf of black gau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; a &s;mall cap, whiter than Alpine &s;nows, attempt|ed vainly to confine her flaxen tre&s;&s;es, which &s;ell in waving ringlets on her &s;houlders, and &s;trayed over her fair forehead. When &s;he had emptied the fragrant contents of her ba&s;ket, &s;he bent up|on one knee upon the brink of the grave, then rai&s;ing her tearful eyes of cele&s;tial blue to heaven, &s;he &s;eemed to breathe a &s;ilent prayer for the &s;oul of the departed Marquis; then, accompanied by the village maidens, &s;he retired from the &s;pot, pa&s;&s;ing thro the vacancy which again was formed for them. Albert followed the &s;weet mourner, who, bidding adieu to her a&s;&s;ociates, moved down the church, looking around with anxious eyes, as if in que&s;t of &s;ome object intere&s;ting to her affections.&mdash;Suddenly, &s;he &s;prang toward a venerable old man, who was tottering to the porch, and throwing around him her fair arms, &s;he &s;upported him to a &s;eat, where, placing her|&s;elf by him, they pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome moments in the elo|quent &s;ilence of unaffected grief. Never had Albert beheld &s;o beautiful a picture.&mdash;It was Em|ma, &s;upporting on her bo&s;om the &s;ilver head of Bernard, while from her eyes tear after tear, in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, dropped on his furrowed cheek!&mdash;The &s;tranger re&s;pected too much their mutual grief to interrupt it, and perceiving the funeral train returning from the grave, he acco&s;ted one of the pea&s;ants who was neare&s;t to him, and ea|gerly inquired the name of the maiden who &s;eem|ed to lead the young group that &s;trewed flowers at the grave. The pea&s;ant gave Albert every
<PB N="209" REF="034525_0212_0FFE1B76CEE4D208">
information which he de&s;ired, and as the day was declining fa&s;t, he offered the traveller a bed at his cottage, which being contiguous to that of Bernard, proved a temptation not to be re&s;i&s;ted. Hone&s;t Pierot led Albert a &s;hort cut thro &s;ome fields, and after having recommended his gue&s;t to the attentions of his wife, he ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle gates, in que&s;t of the &s;ervant whom Albert had ordered to wait there his return.</P>
<P>In this humble but neat dwelling, the young &s;tranger determined to re&s;ide &s;ome days, under pretence of exploring, at his lei&s;ure, the exten|&s;ive domains of the ca&s;tle, but in reality to intro|duce him&s;elf to the lovely Emma and her father. The impre&s;&s;ion, which her artle&s;s beauty made on his heart, was of &s;o &s;erious a nature, that he indulged the hopes of making her his wife, if he found, on acquaintance, her mind as charming as her per&s;on, and &s;he would accept his proffered vows.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t make a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion while we re|turn to the &s;tate of the family affairs of the late Marquis, for &s;ome years before his decea&s;e.&mdash;He had been married, late in life, to an amiable wo|man, by whom he had an only &s;on: having pa&s;|&s;ed the winter at Paris, he was unexpectedly cal|led away to attend &s;ome important bu&s;ine&s;s at Clairville-ca&s;tle: he &s;et off immediately, leaving his lady and infant &s;on, then about three years&punc; old to follow. After the fatigues of a bu&s;y day, on the evening that he expected the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="210" REF="034525_0213_0FFE1B7B106718C0">
to arrive, he was waiting her approach upon a terrace which commanded his fine park. As his anxious eyes were turned toward the grand ave|nue, which led to the ca&s;tle, he perceived one of the dome&s;tics who had been left to attend her, advancing, with as much &s;peed as the tired &s;tate of his hor&s;e would allow. The Marquis ha&s;ten|ed toward him, to receive tidings of his belov|ed wife, but what were his &s;en&s;ations, when the &s;ervant informed him, that the carriage of the Marchione&s;s and her ritinue, had been attacked by an armed banditti, who ru&s;hed out of a ca&s;tle. The attendants, who were likewi&s;e armed, &s;ur|rounded the carriage, and for &s;ometime made a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, but he had every rea&s;on to fear, that, overpowered by numbers, they had &s;carce a chance of defending their mi&s;tre&s;s from the fu|ry of the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and in all probability they had fallen victims with her to the murderous &s;words of their a&s;&s;ailants. The me&s;&s;enger of the&s;e dreadful tidings had been tempted by an early flight to e&s;cape to the ca&s;tle, impelled by the feeble hope of gaining them &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the road being &s;olitary which led to the cha|teau, he had met no human being on his way. The Marquis lo&s;t no time in u&s;ele&s;s lamentations, but in&s;tantly arming him&s;elf and &s;everal of his brave dome&s;tics, who were ready to encounter any danger for &s;o beloved a ma&s;ter, they mount|ed their hor&s;es, and in a &s;hort time reached the fatal &s;pot. They here found a &s;pectacle of hor|ror: the mangled bodies of the &s;ervants lay life|le&s;s round the carriage, in which the murdered
<PB N="211" REF="034525_0214_0FFE1B7CA4797A88">
Marchione&s;s and here two women remained, with wounds yet bleeding! In the mid&s;t of this de&s;o|lation, the Marquis &s;ought in vain his infant &s;on, who&s;e ab&s;ence in&s;pired, amid his &s;orrows, a &s;e|cret and pre&s;aging hope, that he had been either re&s;cued or pre&s;erved. He placed him&s;elf and his followers in ambu&s;cade in the wood for the re|mainder of the day, with a view to &s;urpri&s;e the villains &s;hould they return at night, and either revenge this horrid ma&s;&s;acre, or fall in the at|tempt: his hopes were vain: the wretches, &s;ated with their bloody deeds, approached no more the fatal &s;pot. Early on the en&s;uing morning, they began to remove the &s;laughtered victims: they had been joined by all the neighboring villagers, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ad office. As they were rai&s;ing &s;ome of the lifele&s;s attendants, they were &s;tartled by a groan from one of the bodies: on an imme|diate &s;earch, they found a dying &s;tranger, whom they concluded to be one of the banditti, who had probably, from being concealed under &s;eve|ral dead bodies, e&s;caped the recollection of the villains. They rai&s;ed and &s;upported the wound|ed wretch, hoping if he recovered, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a &s;urgeon, who had followed the Mar|quis, by his orders, to this &s;cene of death, and had in vain attempted to re&s;tore the Marchione&s;s and her unfortunate &s;uite, they might obtain in|formation of the fate of the young Marquis.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="034525_0215_0FFE1B8235DCBDF8">
He &s;eemed to revive a little by an effect which the attention had upon him. The Mar|quis a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;upporting him, while the &s;urgeon poured a cordial down his throat.&mdash;His facul|ties in &s;ome degree appeared to return, he gazed on the Marquis and attempted to &s;peak, but in vain.&mdash;Clairville then addre&s;&s;ed him thus;&mdash;</P>
<P>"I conjure thee by the hopes of mercy here and hereafter, tell me, if thou ha&s;t power to &s;peak, <HI>where</HI> is my &s;on?&mdash;<HI>does</HI> he &s;urvive? An|&s;wer <HI>that</HI> que&s;tion only for the pre&s;ent, and I will wait the event of thy recovery for further in|formation."</P>
<P>The dying man, made repeated efforts to ar|ticulate, but for &s;ome moments he remained &s;peechle&s;s: at length he faintly uttered, "young Clairville lives." He could no more; the exer|tion overcame him; and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive convul&s;ions &s;eizing his whole frame, he expired in agonies.</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;ion, in the mid&s;t of &s;o &s;evere an af|fliction, long kept alive in the bo&s;om of the Mar|quis &s;ome feeble embers of expiring hope: he returned to the &s;olitary ca&s;tle, &s;o late the &s;cene of all his happine&s;s where he &s;hut him&s;elf up for &s;e|veral days to give vent to the fir&s;t emotions of his &s;orrow. The &s;u&s;pence, which he yet endur|ed, relative to his &s;on's de&s;tiny had &s;uch an effect upon his &s;pirits, that he determined to retire wholly from the world, and to implore, in the &s;olitude of his ca&s;tle, the misfortunes of his fa|mily:
<PB N="213" REF="034525_0216_0FFE1B83B9EFF090">
but he did not &s;o much yield to the impre&s;|&s;ions of grief, as to be regardle&s;s to his tenants and dependents: his generous nature would not permit him to be unmindful of their intere&s;ts. They had long been the objects of his bounty: they now became the children of his adoption; and, lo&s;t to dome&s;tic felicity, he centered all his remaining con&s;olation in di&s;pen&s;ing happine&s;s to all around him. Years followed years, in this manner; every &s;earch after his beloved &s;on had been fruitle&s;s; he had long cea&s;ed to indulge the flattering pro&s;pect, which he had at fir&s;t en|tertained, of recovering his trea&s;ure; and tho his pious re&s;ignation permitted him not to mur|mur at the degrees of Providence, yet no ray of hope cheared his declining age.</P>
<P>He beheld death approaching with that &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, which anticipated a ble&s;t re-union with tho&s;e dear objects, who had already &s;o long partaken of the rewards of innocence and virtue. On the decea&s;e of the Marquis, his e&s;tates de|volved by inheritance, on the Baron of Moren|zi, who was of a haughty, cruel character, and revengeful; who&s;e rea&s;on and actions were &s;ub|&s;ervient to his pa&s;&s;ions; and who &s;crupled not the commi&s;&s;ion of any exce&s;s, to gratify his ambition, avarice, or &s;en&s;uality.</P>
<P>Over the&s;e vices he had, by art and cunning, drawn a veil, which impo&s;ed on &s;trangers; and to unfold which, a con&s;iderable &s;hare of &s;agacity and penetration was requi&s;ite; on tho&s;e whom his
<PB N="214" REF="034525_0217_0FFE1B85424669A8">
heart &s;ecretly dete&s;ted, he could &s;mile with ea&s;e. A character &s;o hypocritical could not fail of be|coming the aver&s;ion of the adjacent country: for however the deceiver may conceal his vices, in the formalities of courts and public life, they will always appear in their true light to tho&s;e, to whom they are objects of neither fear nor regard.&mdash;His new va&s;&s;als and dependents received a &s;pe|cimen of that treatment which they were in fu|ture to expect, from the fir&s;t moment of his arri|val at his new abode.</P>
<P>They had collected together in the court of the ca&s;tle, to celebrate his approach. "Wherefore," &s;aid he, as he de&s;cended from his carriage, "are you a&s;&s;embled here with gloomy faces and fable habiliments?&mdash;Is this the welcome you give your new lord? I think you might have &s;pared the&s;e trappings of woe for a departed ma&s;ter, to wait with joy the commands of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. An uni|ver&s;al &s;ilence &s;ucceeded this ungracious harangue, which &s;o exa&s;perated the baron, who expected to be received with acclamations of plea&s;ure, that he broke forth in the following words "De|part, you minions of that indolent &s;upinene&s;s, which marked the character of him whom you mourn in vain;&mdash;quit my ca&s;tle, and if you have any bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act, I refer you to my &s;tew|ard, who has attended me hither, and who will impart to you my commands." Awed and &s;hock|ed to &s;ilence, the humble train retired from the pre&s;ence of a man, who&s;e dominion over them promi&s;ed nothing but the exertion of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. In a day or two after his arrival, the
<PB N="215" REF="034525_0218_0FFE1B881AC93550">
&s;y&s;tem of affairs was entirely changed. The old &s;teward was di&s;carded and his place &s;upplied by a man, who had gained the confidence of the baron by the abject &s;ervility of his flattery.</P>
<P>The faithful &s;ervants were di&s;charged, and &s;uc|ceeded by others, who had been the in&s;truments of his vices. Bernard only, and a few more, who from the meanne&s;s of their &s;ituations had e&s;|caped his notice, were &s;till permitted to occupy their &s;everal departments. In&s;tead of the conde|&s;cen&s;ion, with which their late lord had treated all around him, the new ma&s;ter of the&s;e domains kept them at an awful di&s;tance; and never permit|ed the plaints of poverty to reach his ear, or the groans of oppre&s;&s;ion to plead for mercy: &s;uffer|ing virtue never obtained redre&s;s from his com|pa&s;&s;ion, nor innocence from his ju&s;tice. He had lived a life of luxury and debauchery, which had involved his private fortune in difficulties, from which his great acqui&s;ition was calculated to ex|tricate him. A multitude of importunate credi|tors, di&s;turbed the fir&s;t moments of his &s;miling fortune; and in&s;tead of appropriating to the pay|ment of his debts, a part of the princely revenue, the enjoyment of which he &s;o little merited, &s;uch was his mean avarice, that he immediately de|voted to the axe &s;ome lofty rows of venerable trees, for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive centuries the greate&s;t pride and ornament of the ca&s;tle of Clairville.</P>
<P>We now return to Albert, who &s;oon gained that introduction, at the cottage of Bernard, which he &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought, and by frequenting the &s;ociety of this worthy old man, he had daily
<PB N="216" REF="034525_0219_0FFE1B8DA5D85AC0">
opportunities of &s;eeing, and conver&s;ing with his lovely daughter.&mdash;Powerfully charmed at fir&s;t fight by her per&s;onal attractions, he now found, on acquaintance, an irre&s;i&s;tible fa&s;cination in the &s;uperior beauties of her mind. Nature had form|ed her &s;entiments, ju&s;t, delicate, and virtuous, and her education had for two years received great advantage from a frequent intercour&s;e with a lady of birth and di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, who had, on the decea&s;e of her hu&s;band, retired into a &s;mall habitation, &s;ituated in a vale near Ber|nard's cottage: this amiable widow had lived many years in the great world, and had partaken both of its pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, &s;ufficiently to &s;hew her the in&s;tability of fortune: with her beloved lord, &s;he had had lo&s;t the &s;uperfluities of life; but &s;atisfied with competence, &s;he devot|ed the remainder of her days to &s;olitude and reli|gion.</P>
<P>She conceived for Emma, then ju&s;t fifteen, a &s;trong attachment, and ea&s;ily obtained Bernard's permi&s;&s;ion for his daughter's frequent vi&s;its. The good woman delighted in cultivating a mind who&s;e capacity and genius promi&s;ed every &s;ucce&s;s. Emma read aloud for hours, uninterruptedly, to her kind patrone&s;s, and with an attention, that impre&s;&s;ed upon her memory every thing worthy to be retained; and the &s;ubjects were con&s;tantly calculated to improve the morals and enlarge the under&s;tanding. At the end of two years, death &s;topped the progre&s;s of Emma's education, by &s;uddenly depriving her of this mo&s;t excellent friend; her little income reverted to the family of her hu&s;band, and &s;he had nothing to leave the
<PB N="217" REF="034525_0220_0FFE1B8F2AD0E448">
child of her adoption, but the &s;imple furniture of her little dwelling. Emma mourned with af|fectionate regret, a lo&s;s &s;o great, but determined to per&s;erve in tho&s;e &s;tudies, for which &s;he had ac|quired &s;o correct a ta&s;te, and which &s;he was hap|pily enabled to do, by becoming the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the valuable and &s;elect collection of books, which formed the &s;mall library of the decea&s;ed. But ri&s;ing very early in the morning, Emma was en|abled to pur&s;ue her favorite employment, with|out tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on tho&s;e hours, when her filial duties or dome&s;tic cares demanded her attention.</P>
<P>Young Albert &s;oon di&s;covered in the conver&s;a|tion of Bernard's lovely daughter, a well inform|ed mind, and an under&s;tanding which blended the artle&s;s &s;implicity of rural life, with the more refined &s;entiments of cultivated education.</P>
<P>The mental accompli&s;hments of Emma comple|ted the conque&s;t which her beauty had begun in the heart of Albert; nor was it long ere a re|ciprocal and gentle flame was communicated to her bo&s;om. The ardent lover, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> flatter|ing moment of a&s;piring hope, declared his pa&s;|&s;ion, and offered at her feet his honorable vows. She blu&s;hed mode&s;tly, and referred her a&s;&s;ent to her father's will. The heart of Bernard, at this unexpected propo&s;al, felt all at her father's rap|ture; but the &s;trict rectitude of his &s;entiments checked the momentary joy, and with that &s;in|cerity which marked his character, he declined &s;o unequal an alliance, and repre&s;ented to his
<PB N="218" REF="034525_0221_0FFE1B90B24A09E8">
young friend the impropriety of his forming any union un&s;anctioned by his family. "Accept our gratitude," &s;aid Bernard, "for the honor which you intend us: were you le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by rank and fortune, I &s;hould be proud to call you &s;on. Emma's only dower is virtue, and her birth is too humble for her to become your wife. Ne|ver &s;hall fal&s;e vanity, or &s;ordid intere&s;t, betray me to an action at which my con&s;cience would re|volt.

Bernard returned not to his cottage till Al|bert had quitted the village: when he en|tered, Emma advanced to meet him, her eyes &s;ur|charged with tears: &s;he pre&s;ented him with a letter which Albert, retiring to write for a few moments before he mounted his hor&s;e, had ordered his &s;ervant to leave as he pa&s;&s;ed the door. It breathed the language of eternal love, and a&s;&s;ured her, that as he quitted her only to accelerate their union, &s;he might &s;oon expect his return to claim her promi&s;ed hand: Bernard fold|ing up the letter when he had read it, and put|ting it in his pocket, thus addre&s;&s;ed his trembling daughter, who waited &s;ilently her fate: "Be|ware, my child, how you &s;uffer your heart to be|tray your happine&s;s; tru&s;t not to the prote&s;tations of a lover.

Emma funk at the feet of her venerable fire, and embracing his knees, "Never, never," exclaimed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he, while tears rol|led down her pale cheeks, "&s;hall your child wander from the path of honor!&mdash;You &s;hall guide and direct all her actions, your coun&s;els &s;hall for|tify the weakne&s;s of her heart, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her to &s;ubdue every &s;entiment di&s;approved by you; and if &s;he cannot immediately forget the con&s;picuous virtues of her lo&s;t Albert, at lea&s;t, &s;he will hum|ble her ambitious hopes, which had the pre&s;ump|tion to &s;oar above her ob&s;cure birth, and a&s;pire to an alliance to which &s;he had no preten&s;ions, but what the delu&s;ive voice of love and Albert awak|ened in her bo&s;om." Bernard folded her in her arms with all a father's fond delight; and ap|plauded the &s;entiments, which flowed from a heart capable of &s;acrificing every inclination to that duty which &s;he owed him. Emma po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;trength of mind &s;uperior to her years, and tho &s;he tried in vain to forget an object &s;o tenderly beloved, &s;he &s;o far rea&s;oned her&s;elf into a per&s;ua|&s;ion that the friends, of Albert would never con|&s;ent to their marriage, without which &s;he was re|&s;olutely determined never to accept his hand, that &s;he renounced every idea of being united to him, and bani&s;hed the &s;educing hope of beholding him again.</P>

was &s;pinning, one &s;ultry day, in a bower of ho|ney-&s;uckles, near the gate of their little cottage, accompanied by one of her young female neigh|bors, the Baron de Morenzi pa&s;&s;ed by on hor&s;e-back, and ca&s;ting his eyes on the fair Emma, was &s;o &s;truck with her beauty, that he &s;uddenly &s;top|ped, and di&s;mounting, approached the wicket. Taking off his hat he complained of a dizzine&s;s in his head, for which he politely reque&s;ted a gla&s;s of water: Emma aro&s;e, and tripping into the hou&s;e, quickly returned with a chry&s;tal draught, which &s;he pre&s;ented to him with a native grace that accompanied all her motions. He had, dur|ing her &s;hort ab&s;ence, informed him&s;elf that &s;he was the daughter of Bernard, who &s;erved him as under-bailiff. He accepted the cup from her hand, and while he &s;wallowed the contents, he drank, at the &s;ame time, from her bewitching eyes, a draught, which &s;pread an irre&s;i&s;tible poi|&s;on thro his veins. The baron was indebted to nature for a fine per&s;on, and to art, for that im|po&s;ing elegance of addre&s;s, which &s;eldom failed to in&s;inuate his wi&s;hes with &s;ucce&s;s, when the do|minion of a tender pa&s;&s;ion tempted him to glo&s;s over his haughty demeanor with di&s;&s;embled con|de&s;cen&s;ion. Ju&s;t as he was returning the cup to the lovely Emma, who &s;tood to receive it, with her looks bent upon the ground, to avoid the fix|ed gaze of his penetrating eyes, Bernard &s;udden|ly appeared, and afforded his daughter an oppor|tunity to retire into the cottage.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="034525_0225_0FFE1B9D9C150A88">
The good old bailiff acco&s;ted his lord with a re&s;pect, which, while it acknowledged his &s;upe|riority as a ma&s;ter, was unmixed with that kind of &s;ervile humility, which demeans the dignity of man. He had never before attracted the notice of the Baron, who forgetting the di&s;tance, which birth and fortune had placed between them, recol|lected only that he was the father of Emma, and might, perhaps, a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the views which he had formed to corrupt her virtue. Acco&s;ting him, therefore, with kind familiarity, he reque&s;ted that he might take a &s;urvey of his little dwelling, which he &s;hould be welcome to exchange for one more convenient and comfortable. "My lord," replied Bernard, "in this humble dwelling my infant eyes fir&s;t opened, and here I would wi&s;h to clo&s;e their aged lids."</P>
<P>"But," interrupted the Baron," you begin to bow under the weight of years, and in need of re&s;t and indulgence; I &s;hall feel a true &s;atisfac|tion in rendering your latter days happy."&mdash;"Permit me to a&s;&s;ure you," &s;aid Bernard, "that a life of hone&s;t indu&s;try, and uncorrupted inno|cence, has already in&s;ured to me that happine&s;s in its clo&s;ing &s;cene, which an irreproachable con|&s;cience only can be&s;tow, but which riches can ne|ver give." "You have a daughter, however, interrupted the Baron, &s;milling, "too young to have adopted your &s;toical ideas." "I have a daughter," retorted Bernard, "who inherits her mother's virtue, and has been taught by precept and example tho&s;e &s;entiments, which have render|ed her too contented in her &s;ituation, to harbor an ambitious wi&s;h in her bo&s;om." The Baron

reddened at the&s;e words, but commanding, for his own &s;ecret purpo&s;es, the ri&s;ing indignation of of his mind, he conde&s;cendingly bade the vene|rable Bernard adieu; &s;aying, that he &s;till hoped, mature reflection would induce him to accept the favors which he was anxious to confer upon a man, who&s;e re&s;pectable character, and long life of un|&s;ullied virtue claimed a &s;ingular reward.</P>
<P>So &s;aying he mounted his hor&s;e, and returned to the ca&s;tle, revolving in his mind, every prac|ticable &s;cheme for the &s;eduction of the devoted Emma. He reflected that he had never beheld a female half &s;o lovely; and as on no occa&s;ion had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to combat his inclinations, or &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ions, he re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time in accompli&s;hing his de&s;ign. The humble &s;itua|tion of Emma, gave him, in his opinion, an uncontrouled right to her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but he was &s;olicitous, if po&s;&s;ible, to gain an a&s;cenden|cy over her heart, by awakening with her gra|titude tenderer &s;entiments; for this purpo&s;e, he determined to wear the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y a little longer, and then to attempt, by every art of &s;oft deception, to &s;ecure her affections in his favor. A week elap&s;ed after the Baron's vi&s;it at the cottage, without any renewal of his great offers; a circum&s;tance that contributed to di&s;pel tho&s;e fears, which had been awakened in the bo|&s;om of Bernard, by the interview of the Baron with Emma, and his generous profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip to him&s;elf,&mdash;<HI>profe&s;&s;ions,</HI> too oppo&s;ite to the na|tural ferocity of his temper.

them no longer in any light, but in that of a tem|porary inclination toward humanity and kindne&s;s, which could have no root in a &s;oil &s;o barren.&mdash;He pur&s;ued, therefore, without further &s;u&s;picion, his u&s;ual labors; taking, however, the precaution never to leave his daughter without a companion, in his ab&s;ence,</P>
<P>One morning when he had quited the cottage about an hour, a ha&s;ty me&s;&s;enger from the ca&s;tle terrified Emma with an account that her father was taken with a &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition as he pa&s;&s;ed the gates; and having been &s;upported into the hou&s;e by &s;ome of the dome&s;tics, who had ob&s;erved him &s;inking on the ground, the hou&s;ekeeper had thot it proper to &s;end for his daughter, who by being accu&s;tomed perhaps to the&s;e &s;eizures, knew be&s;t how to treat them. The trembling Emma, alarm|ed to the utmo&s;t degree at a di&s;order, which had never yet attacked her beloved father, delayed not a moment to follow her conductor; and taking the arm of her friend Agnes, who had been li&s;tening to her as &s;he was reading aloud, proceeded with tottering &s;teps to the ca&s;tle, di&s;tant from her hum|ble cottage about a mile. When &s;he arrived in the great hall, &s;he met with a female of a re&s;pec|table appearance, and of an advanced age. She eagerly inquired after her father, and earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to be permitted to &s;ee him. The hou&s;e|keeper an&s;wered Emma with the appearance of much &s;en&s;ibility, that Bernard was &s;o perfectly recovered by a cordial which &s;he had admini&s;ter|ed, that he had returned to his daily occupation, ignorant that his illne&s;s could have reached his
<PB N="225" REF="034525_0228_0FFE1BA78ECC40F8">
daughter's ears. "Thank heaven!" exclaimed the innocent Emma, "O, madam, accept my hum|ble gratitude for your kind care, and &s;uffer one of the dome&s;tics to direct me to the &s;pot where I may find my dear father; I will watch by his &s;ide during the labors of the day, or attend him to our cottage, if he will permit me to lead him thither."</P>
<P>"Be no longer anxious, my lovely child," re|plied the matron, "your father will be here at the hour when the turret bell &s;hall call the family to dinner; he promi&s;ed to meet my lord's &s;teward, to receive &s;ome orders from the Baron."&mdash;The un&s;u&s;pecting Emma thanked her kind informer, and was departing, but pre&s;&s;ed conde&s;cendingly to continue there till the return of Bernard, and in the interval, to take a &s;urvey of the apart|ments in the ca&s;tle, in &s;ome of which, alterations were making, &s;he con&s;ented to wait her father's return. While her obliging guide was leading her into a large &s;aloon, &s;he turned round to &s;eek for Agnes, whom, till that in&s;tant, &s;he imagined to have been &s;till near her &s;ide. She expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome anxiety at her ab&s;ence, to the hou&s;e-keeper, who ob&s;erved, that her friend had remained in the fir&s;t hall, and immediately &s;ent a woman, then de&s;cending a &s;tair-ca&s;e, to e&s;cort her to them, Emma, in the mean time, pur&s;ued the &s;teps of her conductre&s;s, who having pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;tate a|partments, opened a door that led to a library, and which &s;he had no &s;ooner entered, and direct|ed the attention of Emma to a fine portrait of the late Marchione&s;s de Clairville, that hung over the chimney, than &s;he di&s;appeared. Emma, for
<PB N="226" REF="034525_0229_0FFE1BA91575D9C8">
&s;ome moments, was lo&s;t in contemplating the an|gelic countenance of a woman, who&s;e &s;ad fate &s;he had heard &s;o frequently and &s;o tenderly deplored, which &s;he was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed from the&s;e melan|choly reflections, by the opening of a gla&s;s door, which led to a colonnade filled with exotic plants. If &s;he felt embarra&s;&s;ed by the appearance of the Baron, who entering thence into the library, that what were her &s;en&s;ations, when on making an at|tempt to quit it her&s;elf, &s;he found the door of the apartment locked, and beheld the Baron de Mo|renzi at her feet, in an attitude of re&s;pectful ten|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion and &s;urpri&s;e of Emma, at the humble po&s;ture of the Baron, could only be heightened by his addre&s;s. She had in&s;tantly retreated a few paces from the door which &s;he had vainly attempted to open, and &s;upported her&s;elf with difficulty again&s;t a book-ca&s;e. "Be not alarmed, charming Emma," &s;aid the Baron, in a voice of a&s;&s;umed &s;oftne&s;s, "you &s;ee before you a man, who, till he beheld your incompara|ble beauty, never completely lo&s;t his liberty. Re|gard me no longer as the ma&s;ter of your father, but as the &s;lave and lover of his daughter, and who only waits her commands to &s;hew by his obe|dience the truth and genero&s;ity of his &s;enti|ments." During this &s;peech. Emma's gentle frame was agitated by a variety of inexpre&s;&s;ible emotions. Amazement, fear, and indignation prevented her interruping the Baron; but when, on his ri&s;ing and advancing to her at the clo&s;e of
<PB N="227" REF="034525_0230_0FFE1BAA9A6483F8">
his &s;peech, he attempted to take her hand, "My lord," &s;aid &s;he, &s;hrinking from his touch, "you mu&s;t permit me to a&s;&s;ure you, that I have no wi&s;h but to return to my father: in his cottage all my ideas of happine&s;s are centered. Conde&s;cend to open this door, or to admit my departure thro that colonnade: my intru&s;ion here was entirely owing to Madame de Chalons, who promi&s;ed to &s;hew me the ca&s;tle." "How much indebted am I to her," replied the baron, "for this inter|view, which gives me an opportunity to unfold the &s;entiments of a heart devoted to you alone. No longer &s;hall &s;uch beauty, formed to &s;hine in palaces, be concealed in a cottage. Accept my affections, and command my fortune."</P>
<P>Indignant blu&s;hes dyed the cheeks of Emma, as a propo&s;al, which &s;he could not mi&s;conceive, and all the pride of wounded delicacy ru&s;hing in|to her bo&s;om, &s;u&s;pended for a moment its natural timidity, and animated her to pronounce the&s;e words: "That fortune, my lord, from which you a&s;&s;ume the privilege thus to in&s;ult the daughter of a pea&s;ant, can neither dazzle my va|nity, nor tempt my ambition; my humble birth in&s;pires in me no pride, but that of virtue, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no dignity, but that of con|&s;cious innocence. Allow me to retire my lord: my father doubtle&s;s wonder at my ab&s;ence." "Your father, froward beauty, waits my plea&s;ure in the ca&s;tle," returned the Baron, with a look of anger, "your compliance or rejection of gene|rous offers will decide his future fate. Recollect, Emma, the extent of my power; dread my re|&s;entment, or de&s;erve my gratitude; they each

&s;hall be unbounded. If you reward my pa&s;&s;ion, your father will re&s;ide in this ca&s;tle, freed from the toils of &s;ervitude, the witne&s;s and partaker of tho&s;e benefits, which my love &s;hall heap upon you: receive this ca&s;ket of jewels, as a trifling earne&s;t of a liberality, which &s;hall know no li|mits." While the Baron di&s;played the &s;parkling trea&s;ure to the eyes of the unambitious Emma, &s;he pu&s;hed them from her with di&s;dain. "Once more, my lord," &s;aid &s;he, "let me a&s;&s;ure you, that I have a heart impenetrable to vanity, or grandeur, to which the power of wealth could rai&s;e me:" "But," cried the Baron, interrupt|ing her, &s;oftening the natural ferocity of his fea|tures, and gazing tenderly on her, "is your heart impenetrable to love, and cannot it be moved to yield a generous return to &s;entiments &s;o &s;incere? Let me owe to mutual affection that which you deny to ambition: and accept the ho|nors which &s;hall be offered you, as tributes due from my gratitude, rather than as bribes to al|lure your compliance." "Never, never," re|plied Emma: "my heart will ever continue as untouched by love, as by your proffered gifts: it is proof again&s;t every &s;entiment, that would injure my honor and deba&s;e my virtue!&mdash;No," exclaimed Emma, "could you &s;toop &s;o low as to demand my hand in an honorable alliance, my heart would reject the offer, and my tongue di&s;|claim an union, which no intreaties could induce, no authority compel me to accept! After this ho|ne&s;t confe&s;&s;ion, my lord, you will &s;uffer me to quit your pre&s;ence." The enraged Baron w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ss

now rai&s;ed to a pitch of re&s;entment which bani&s;h|ed at the moment every pa&s;&s;ion but that of an|ger.

<P>The &s;tory of Bernard's illne&s;s had been a fa|brication, invented merely for the purpo&s;e of en|trapping his daughter in the &s;nare laid for her. As he pa&s;&s;ed the ca&s;tle, in the morning he had been met by Mon&s;ieur Du Val, the &s;teward, and reque&s;ted to wait there to receive the commands of his lord, who had &s;ome de&s;igns to communi|cate to him, greatly to his advantage. The good old man, who never yet had formed a wi&s;h, beyond the &s;ufficiency which his humble &s;tation had always allowed him, heard this circum&s;tance with cold indifference; but out of re&s;pect to the Baron, waited his plea&s;ure. He was introduced into a pavilion in the garden, and reque&s;ted not to quit it till the Baron, who propo&s;ed to join him there, &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s him.</P>
<P>He remained above two hours, in vain expec|tation; the &s;teward at length entered, and in|formed him that he had liberty to depart, as the Baron's &s;entiments were changed in regard to him, from the ungrateful rejection, which Em|ma had pre&s;umed to offer to propo&s;als that did her but too much honor, and would have rai&s;ed her and her family to a &s;ituation which mu&s;t have rendered them objects of envy to the &s;urround|ing pea&s;antry.

<P>When Bernard had received from his daugh|ter a minute detail of her late vi&s;it, altho he rejoiced at her pre&s;ent e&s;cape, he fore&s;aw her future danger, and trembled at the fatal con&s;equence which might yet en&s;ue. He knew Morenzi to be void of every principle of honor and humanity: he dreaded the influence of his power, and felt his own defencele&s;s &s;ituation, which he feared would not enable him to protect his devoted child from arbitrary force, and law|le&s;s violence. After revolving in his mind every po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tance, he had worked up his ap|prehen&s;ions to &s;uch an height, as to decide &s;ud|denly, and that an immediate flight could afford the only means of &s;ecurity from an enemy &s;o for|midable.

&mdash;The ca&s;tle of Brinon was the &s;ole a&s;y|lum which he could fix on as eligible; there a &s;i&s;ter of his late wife had lived for many years &s;u|perintendant of the family; and there he hoped he might be permitted to conceal his daughter without danger of di&s;covery; it was di&s;tant from Bernard's village about twenty miles, and he hoped that they &s;hould be able to reach it in a couple of days, He propo&s;ed the &s;cheme to Em|ma, who readily undertook a journey, which would remove her beyond the power, of the dreaded Morenzi. They had no time to lo&s;e, and therefore, without further deliberation, be|gan the preparations nece&s;&s;ary for an expedition &s;o important to their &s;ecurity. Bernard prudent|ly determined to repo&s;e no confidence in any of his neighbors; altho he knew him&s;elf to be be|loved by them &s;ufficiently to &s;ecure their &s;ecrecy, yet he was unwilling to expo&s;e them to the Ba|ron's re&s;entment, by entru&s;ting them with the &s;e|cret of his journey. Bernard took with him his little &s;tore, the hone&s;t earnings of indu&s;trious years; Emma made up a &s;mall parcel of linen; and neither of them being inclined to repo&s;e, they &s;at down to a &s;imple meal, of which, for the &s;ake of each other, altho devoid of appetite, they mutually forced them&s;elves to partake, that they might the better be enabled to encounter the fatigues which they had to undergo.</P>
<P>The village clock &s;truck eleven, the hour when they had agreed to begin their journey. Emma took a mournful &s;urvey of the beloved cottage,
<PB N="234" REF="034525_0237_0FFE1BC012FE55D0">
where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed her life of innocence; &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon her &s;pinning wheel and &s;ighed; then turning to a wicker armed chair, which was the con&s;tant &s;eat of her father, &s;he &s;unk into it, and bur&s;t into tears. "Alas," &s;aid &s;he, "I hop|ed for happy years to come to watch here the calm repo&s;e of him who gave me being; to tend, with duteous affection, his declining age, who reared my infancy with anxious love: I, who would wi&s;h to be his deare&s;t companion, am doomed to bring &s;orrow on his &s;ilver head!"&mdash;"Rather," replied Bernard, extending his hand to lead her from a &s;pot where fond re|membrance &s;eemed to arre&s;t her lingering &s;tops, "&s;ays that my Emma was born to ble&s;s her fa|ther by her exemplary virtues. I triumph in my child, who nobly prefers honorable indigence to &s;plendid infamy! Let us ha&s;ten from impend|ing per&s;ecution;&mdash;let us quit a place, where eve|ry moment endangers her liberty and innocence." Emma &s;tarted up, ca&s;t a fearful look around, and encircling her arm in that of Bernard, they quit|ted the cottage, pa&s;&s;ed thro the &s;leeping hamlet, and reached the road, which led to their de&s;tined a&s;ylum. The moon &s;hone in pen&s;ive maje&s;ty,&mdash;all was &s;till,&mdash;the gentle breeze of night wafted re|fre&s;hing odours,&mdash;and &s;olemn &s;ilence reigned,&mdash;&s;ave the &s;oft notes of warbling nightingales, chanting their tuneful &s;ongs among the fragrant hedges, or, perchance, the di&s;tant bleating of &s;ome wakeful lamb. Emma's delicate frame felt &s;omething rather exhau&s;ted, and obliged her to re&s;t for a few moments; but her fears did not
<PB N="235" REF="034525_0238_0FFE1BC2F1919B10">
permit her to indulge long in a repo&s;e which en|dangered her &s;afety. Bernard comforted her by the a&s;&s;urance, that they approached a village, where there was a public inn; in which they might venture to take &s;ome refre&s;hment, and where he hoped to procure a chai&s;e, to convey them about twelve miles further, which would place them at an ea&s;y di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle of Brinon, and con&s;equently dimini&s;h the danger of pur&s;uit. Thus encouraged, the timid Emma moved onward with renewed courage; and the fugitives reached the inn ju&s;t as a travelling car|riage drove into the courtyard: while the land|lord and his wife were bu&s;ily engaged in attend|ing to the newly arrived gue&s;ts, Bernard applied to one of the &s;ervants to accommodate him and his daughter with a room, until a chai&s;e could be got ready for their u&s;e: his reque&s;t was granted, and they were &s;hewn into a garden, where they waited with &s;ome impatience the arrival of the carriage, in which they were to pur&s;ue their lit|tle journey.</P>
<P>Having urged their reque&s;t to be &s;erved with expedition, the landlord entered, and informed them that by &s;unri&s;e they might depend upon a chai&s;e, but that he would not &s;uffer his hor&s;es to leave the &s;tables until they had been &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed to do their duty: ob&s;erving Emma to ca&s;t a di&s;con&s;olate look upon her father, he &s;aid, "Your young companion may be weary, I re|commend her to take &s;ome re&s;t in a quiet cham|ber, whither my wife &s;hall conduct her." Em|ma, oppre&s;&s;ed by fatigue, which &s;he had under|gone, and finding they had no chance of pur&s;u|ing
<PB N="236" REF="034525_0239_0FFE1BC5D18C62C8">
their journey for the next two hours, accept|ed the propo&s;al, and con&s;ented to retire into an upper chamber; where reclining upon a bed, ju&s;t as &s;he was, notwith&s;tanding the agitations of her mind, &s;he &s;unk into a profound repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us quit a-while the virtuous fugitives, to follow Albert into Swi&s;&s;erland. He quitted the village where Emma dwelt, with a heart deeply impre&s;&s;ed by the perfections of a woman, who&s;e noble rejection of his hand, from the mo&s;t deli|cate motives, had rai&s;ed her in his e&s;teem. The Count de Bournonville, his father, was a man truly re&s;pectable in rank and character; he lived but to promote the happine&s;s of his friends; and had been &s;o uniformly indulgent to the wi&s;hes of Albert, that he had every thing to expect from his genero&s;ity and kindne&s;s. The education of this only &s;urviving &s;on had been cultivated with the utmo&s;t attention; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a brilliant ge|nius, a &s;olid under&s;tanding, and a heart with ho|nor, &s;en&s;ibility, and virtue.</P>
<P>The Count welcomed his &s;on with tho&s;e marks of tenderne&s;s, which promi&s;ed every thing to the ardent hopes of Albert. On the evening of his return, impatient to urge a &s;uit, upon the &s;ucce&s;s of which his happine&s;s depended, he reque&s;ted a private audience of his father, who appointed an interview in his clo&s;et, before they &s;hould re|tire to their &s;eparate apartments for the night. They met at the &s;tated hour, each bearing te&s;ti|mony in his expre&s;&s;ive countenance of the impor|tant
<PB N="237" REF="034525_0240_0FFE1BC8AC540D90">
&s;ecret which oppre&s;&s;ed his heart. The youthful impetuo&s;ity of Albert arre&s;ted the Count's attention, by an in&s;tant confe&s;&s;ion of his pa&s;&s;ion, and by his reliance on parental indulgence to crown his wi&s;hes: the Count de Bournonville li&s;|tened without interruption, to the character of Emma, painted with all the ardent enthu&s;ia&s;m of love in the glowing colors of perfection. Albert cea&s;ed;&mdash;the pau&s;e of a moment &s;ucceeded;&mdash;when his father looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon him, thus replied, "Ever ready to promote your feli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ity, I &s;hall not attempt to rea&s;on you out of an attach|ment, which you de&s;cribe &s;o worthy of your choice, in every thing but birth and fortune&punc; You are undoubtedly the &s;afe&s;t judge in point of &s;uch con&s;equence as an union for life: but a &s;ub|ject of &s;till more <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> importance <HI>now</HI> demands your attention. You mu&s;t in future decide your own de&s;tiny:&mdash;I no longer can claim from you the duty of <HI>obedience.</HI> You are the child alone of <HI>my adoption,</HI> but the <HI>real,</HI> the indi&s;putable &s;on of a noble and unfortunate Marquis, the heir of a princely fortune, the real Henry de Clairville! wronged of your natural rights by an u&s;urper; who doomed you to a death in early infancy, from which Providence re&s;cued your innocence."&mdash;"And who murdered, with barbarian hand, my honored mother?" exclaimed Albert, attentive with increa&s;ing wonder to the words of the Count; and who&s;e imagination had been wrought up al|mo&s;t to a pitch of frenzy at the clo&s;e of the &s;peech. "This arm," continued he, "&s;hall re|venge her &s;acred blood in that of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!"
<PB N="238" REF="034525_0241_0FFE1BCB8AB1F210">
&mdash;But &s;uddenly his features &s;oftened into a look of greatful tenderne&s;s, recollecting him&s;elf, and falling at the feet of Bournonville, he thus con|tinued; "Forgive, oh, <HI>parent</HI> of my <HI>de&s;erted in|fancy,</HI> the foce of nature, that &s;u&s;pended in my brea&s;t the endle&s;s debt of gratitude which I owe you: here let my heart ever acknowledge the tribute due to filial love; while my &s;word aven|ges the blood of murdered innocence; from who&s;e honored &s;ource! drew my own exi&s;tence. But &s;ay, my Lord, whence do you derive this &s;trange intelligence?" The Count then informed him, that in his late ab&s;ence he had taken into his family a &s;ervant, di&s;charged from the ca&s;tle of Clairville, on the death of the late Marquis, and who, being a native of Swi&s;&s;erland, had return|ed to an uncle re&s;iding there in credit, by whom he had been recommended. That Prevot, inter|rogated relative to the motive of his quitting France, had given him a circum&s;tantial account of the occurrences which had pa&s;&s;ed in the fami|ly of the Marquis, including the fatal death of the Marchione&s;s, and the lo&s;s of her young &s;on. "The&s;e events," continued the Count, "I &s;ound from Prevot's recital, pa&s;&s;ed at a period, when I was returning with my wife thro France to Swi&s;|&s;erland; but &s;o expeditious was my journey, that the foregoing circum&s;tances never reached my ears: an infant &s;on had accompanied our tour; and by a &s;udden illne&s;s incident to children, it plea&s;ed heaven to recal the gift, with which it had ble&s;&s;ed us for a &s;hort time; the Counte&s;s was incon&s;olable, and I feared grief would have had a fatal effect upon her delicate frame; when an
<PB N="239" REF="034525_0242_0FFE1BCD10D0F650">
extraordinary incident rou&s;ed her attention from the indulgence of her private woes, to exer|ci&s;e it on an object who&s;e intere&s;ting age claimed the offices of humanity from her maternal care."</P>
<P>Albert li&s;tened with attentive &s;ilence while the Count de Bournonville continued thus his narrative: "My faithful Durand accompanied us in our travels; he has &s;pent his youth in my &s;ervice, and by his firm attachment has merited the place which he holds in my e&s;teem. As we were pa&s;&s;ing a frequented road, Durand, who followed us on hor&s;eback, perceived upon the ground a &s;leeping infant. Surpri&s;ed to &s;ee no per&s;on near, and that the child had been left ap|parently unprotected, he &s;topped his hor&s;e, when, from a wood which bordered the road, a man &s;ud|denly &s;tarted forth, and thus addre&s;&s;ed Durand, in a tone of agitation, if you have an inclination to do an act of mercy, take charge of this de|&s;olate infant: his life will be forfeited, &s;hould you refu&s;e to &s;ave him:&mdash;Spare his innocence, and &s;natch a &s;oul from guilt. He is of noble blood, born to inherit a &s;plendid fortune, but vengeance will pur&s;ue and overwhelm him, un|le&s;s you generou&s;ly re&s;cue him,"&mdash;With the&s;e words, not waiting for a reply, he bounded a|gain into the wood, and left Durand in the ut|mo&s;t con&s;ternation. The hone&s;t fellow, trem|bling for the fate of the child, would not ri&s;que a moment the threatened danger, but lifting the little infant gently from the ground, and placing him on his hor&s;e &s;oon overtook our carriage, and &s;topping it, ha&s;tily related the adventure, and
<PB N="240" REF="034525_0243_0FFE1BCFEC9CD660">
pre&s;ented us with the foundling, who, awaken|ed by the motion, was pouring forth his little &s;orrows: the Counte&s;s &s;natched him eagerly to her bo&s;om, he &s;milled innocently in her face, and cea&s;ed to cry, as if recollecting in her arms a mother's fond embrace.&mdash;"Yes," &s;aid &s;he, di&s;|&s;olving into tears, "thou &s;halt be protected, lovely infant; thou &s;halt replace in my vacant af|fections the lo&s;s of my lamented Albert, my care and tenderne&s;s &s;hall &s;upply that of a fond parent, and &s;helter thee from thy barbarous ene|mies!"&mdash;The better to &s;ecure your &s;afety, we a|greed to call you by the name of our lamented &s;on, and to conduct you to Swi&s;&s;erland as &s;uch. We &s;wore to &s;ecre&s;y Durand and the Counte&s;s's wo|man, who attended us, on whom we could de|pend, and who have inviolably kept the &s;ecret; which till this hour has been concealed from all the world, even from your&s;elf, whom I adopted with a tenderne&s;s equal to parental &s;entiments. Hea|ven not having thot fit to ble&s;s me with other chil|dren, I fixed my hopes on you, and had long cea&s;ed to expect, and I will confe&s;s even to wi&s;h, that fate would di&s;clo&s;e the hidden my&s;tery of your birth. You will remember the dying &s;cene of the incomparable Counte&s;s, who had &s;o ten|derly fulfilled for you a mother's duties: you re|ceived her ble&s;&s;ing, and mourned her lo&s;s with fi|lial &s;orrow. I complied, rather reluctantly, with your de&s;ire to travel, and obtained your promi&s;e not to be ab&s;ent from me on your fir&s;t expedition more than three months. The account which we received from Prevot of the unfortunate death of the Marchione&s;s de Clairville, and the unknown
<PB N="241" REF="034525_0244_0FFE1BD574A57A60">
fate of her infant &s;on, corre&s;ponding exactly with the time and circum&s;tances of your adop|tion, left Durand and me little doubt, but that you were the devoted victim of the concealed a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in: we determined, however, not to let our &s;u&s;picions tran&s;pire before your return, which I daily expected from the la&s;t letters that I had re|ceived. A week ago, Durand pa&s;&s;ing thro the &s;treets of Zurich, was acco&s;ted by a &s;tranger, whom he &s;oon recollected, in &s;pite of the ve&s;ti|ges of time, to be the per&s;on who had entru&s;ted him with the care of the infant Albert.&mdash;"Thank heaven," exclaimed the &s;tranger, "I have lived to meet you once again! You have never quitted my remembrance, altho many years have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince I recommended to your protection a per&s;e|cuted child. If he &s;till &s;hould live, heaven may yet re&s;tore him to his rights. Conde&s;cend to fol|low me to my habitation, where I will unfold a &s;tory terrible to relate, the concealment of which has co&s;t my con&s;cience &s;o dear." Durand readily complied with his reque&s;t, and learnt from him the confe&s;&s;ion; that being a &s;ervant in the family of the Baron de Morenzi, he had been bribed by promi&s;es, and intimidated by threats, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ma&s;ter, in the &s;eizure of the Marchone&s;s de Clair|ville and her &s;on on the road to Clairville ca&s;tle; but that having been previou&s;ly haunted by a hor|rid dream, he had determined to &s;ave, if po&s;&s;i|ble, the young Marquis; that he con&s;ulted with his brother, who was al&s;o in the Baron's &s;ervice, and who afterwards lo&s;t his life in the action, and they both agreed together at all events, to re&s;cue
<PB N="242" REF="034525_0245_0FFE1BD7211AD2B0">
the child, the chief object of Morenzi's malice, and the certain impediment to his wi&s;hes of inhe|riting the revenues of Clairville ca&s;tle. In the beginning of the engagement, Fargeon declared, that with a view to &s;ave him, he &s;natched the in|fant from his mother's arms, who had &s;wooned on the approach of the armed villains; and that having e&s;caped with him to the wood, he lulled him to &s;leep on a bank near the road; where he watched the approach of &s;ome pa&s;&s;enger whom he hoped to move with compa&s;&s;ion; that he waited not long, as Durand was &s;oon after &s;ent by Pro|vidence to be the fortunate in&s;trument of his pre|&s;ervation: Fargeon added, that he then returned to the Baron, who him&s;elf had headed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> vil|lainous troop; and found it not difficult to per|&s;uade him, that he had with his own hands &s;trang|led the child, and buried him in a deep ditch. Soon after the&s;e occurrences he had married and retired to Swi&s;&s;erland with his wife, where he had lived with an upbraiding con&s;cience ever &s;ince, upon the wages of iniquity; with this &s;ole con|&s;olation, however, that he was in appearance a|lone guilty of the murder&mdash;He had lately arriv|ed at the knowledge of the late Marquis's de|cea&s;e, and of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Baron, which awakened in his mind &s;uch remor&s;e for the &s;hare taken by him in the deception, that he had almo&s;t re&s;olved to return to France, in order to divulge a &s;ecret, which oppre&s;&s;ed his con&s;cience; when he unexpectedly met and recollected Durand, to whom he re&s;olutely confe&s;&s;ed the whole. My faithful dome&s;tic lo&s;t no time in imparting to me
<PB N="243" REF="034525_0246_0FFE1BD8A4B9F658">
this momentous &s;ecret: I have not yet di&s;clo&s;ed to Prevot the di&s;covery, which his intelligence made to me of your family, but had immediate|ly confided it to Durand, who&s;e report of Far|geon's confe&s;&s;ion, added a &s;trong confirmation of circum&s;tances, &s;ufficiently evident before. The &s;ecret yet remains between us undivulged:&mdash;but now is the cri&s;is of your fate, and the moment is arrived for you to a&s;&s;ert your claims,&mdash;to prove your exi&s;tence,&mdash;to expo&s;e to ju&s;tice the u&s;urper of your rights&mdash;"and the murderer of my mo|ther!" exclaimed Albert; "little did I conceive, when I attended the funeral of the lamented Marquis de Clairville, that I was performing an act of duty, and following a parent to the grave!"</P>
<P>Sleep vi&s;ited not the eyelids of Albert, who pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night in revolving the wondrous events which had been imparted to him. Abhorrence of Morenzi's crimes occu|pied every faculty of his mind; but in the mid&s;t of the&s;e filial emotions the &s;educing form of Emma would &s;ometimes glide into his ideas, en|lightening the future pro&s;pect of his life with brighte&s;t hope. When the Count met Albert in the morning, he found him, impelled by youth|ful ardour and thir&s;t of vengeance, re&s;olved to ha&s;ten to Clairville ca&s;tle, and to challenge the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of his mother. The Count endeavored to &s;ooth his impetuo&s;ity by repre&s;enting to him that the judicature of France would do him ample ju&s;tice; and that they were fortunately armed with evidence &s;ufficient to condemn a traitor, who&s;e artrocious crimes ought to be publicly

<P>We will leave the travellers to pur&s;ue their jour|ney, while we return to the Baron de Morenzi. Du Val, ever indefatigable in a cau&s;e, wherein his own advantage was concerned, had re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the fir&s;t opportunity, which &s;hould offer, to &s;ecure the lovely Emma, in the ab&s;ence of her father. For this purpo&s;e he aro&s;e at break of day, and with two tru&s;ty dome&s;tics, in whom he could confide the ba&s;e&s;t de&s;igns, took his &s;ecret &s;tand behind a thick hedge, that fenced the &s;mall garden of Bernard, with an intent to watch his departure from the cottage, and to &s;eize the un|protected victim whom he had devoted to his own avarice and the licentious pa&s;&s;ion of Moren|zi. While this wretch was lurking in ambu&s;h, &s;ome pea&s;ants accu&s;tomed to call their well-belov|ed neighbor to the occupations of the day, hav|ing repeated their u&s;ual &s;ignal to no purpo&s;e, knocked at the door; they received no an&s;wer; an univer&s;al con&s;ternation prevailed among them. After con&s;ulting &s;ome time, they agreed to force the door, which having affected, they entered, and found to their a&s;toni&s;hment the cottage de|&s;erted. Du Val and his a&s;&s;ociates had by this time joined in the &s;earch, and having no difficul|ty

to account for the flight of Bernard and his daughter, ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle to inform the Ba|ron of a circum&s;tance &s;o mortifying to his pa&s;&s;ion. Morenzi, exa&s;perated with rage and di&s;appoint|ment, vowed vengeance on the fugitives, and or|dering a carriage to be got ready, threw him&s;elf into it with Du Val, determined to overtake the objects of his fury. Altho well convinced that they had been too cautious to attempt concealing them&s;elves in the village, before his departure he ordered that every cottage &s;hould be &s;earched. They took the &s;ame road which Bernard had cho|&s;en and they pur&s;ued the wanderers as clo&s;ely as the interval of &s;ome hours would admit. While Morenzi was engaged in the pur&s;uit of this venerable old man, Bernard, &s;tudiou&s;ly anx|ious to protect his per&s;ucuted daughter, impati|ently waited the approach of morning, when the landlord had promi&s;ed him a carriage. He had locked the door of his daughter's chamber, in|tending not to di&s;turb her repo&s;e until the mo|ment of departure &s;hould arrive, and had return|ed to his room below, where anxiou&s;ly &s;olicitous for the return of day; he &s;tood at a window con|templating the declining moon. He was rou&s;ed from his rever&s;e by the entrance, thro the open door, of a large dog, which jumping up to his knees, began fawning upon him, as recollecting an old acquaintance. Bernard &s;oon called to his remembrance the faithful creature; when his ma&s;ter, who had mi&s;&s;ed his favorite, traced him to that apartment, and entering it, di&s;covered

An explanation &s;oon took place on each &s;ide; and the Count de Bournonville having joined them, he received Bernard with every mark of friend&s;hip and conde&s;cen&s;ion.&mdash;While the good old man was recounting the occa&s;ion of his flight, and the de&s;igns formed by Morenzi to betray the innocence of Emma, the rage of Albert ro&s;e be|yond all bounds; and he &s;olemnly vowed, that the mon&s;ter who had thus injured him by compli|cated villany &s;hould fall the devoted victim of his avenging arm.&mdash;"But where," &s;aid he, "is my incomparable, my glorious Emma?&mdash;Let me, by my pre&s;ence, rea&s;&s;ure her tender apprehen&s;ions, and &s;wear no fate &s;hall &s;eparate us more; but that from this moment &s;he &s;hall find in her devot|ed Albert, the protector of her innocence, the champion of her honour, the avenger of her wrongs!" At that in&s;tant a carriage drove furi|ou&s;ly into the yard, and two per&s;ons alighted from in, in one of whom, as it was now day, Albert recognized Morenzi.&mdash;The impul&s;e of the mo|ment induced him to follow the Baron. They entered a room at the &s;ame time,&mdash;"Villain, traitor, u&s;urper," exclaimed Albert, &s;hutting the door, and inattentive to his own unarmed &s;itua|tion, "defend thy&s;elf, if thou dare&s;t encounter the ju&s;t re&s;entment of Henry de Clairville, who&s;e mother's blood demands the ju&s;tice of a &s;on's re|venge; from a &s;on, who calls upon thee to expi|ate with thy life thy mon&s;trous crimes."</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="034525_0250_0FFE1BE44E910CB8">
The coward heart of Morenzi, &s;truck with the horrors of all con&s;cious guilt, froze in his bo|&s;om; and he &s;tood fixed in mute wonder and di&s;|may. The Count de Bournonville, accompanied by Bernard and his attendants, had joined by this time the unarmed Albert, who might have fallen a victim to the Baron's re&s;entment, had not a &s;en&s;e of his own villainy, together with his a&s;to|ni&s;hment and terror at the &s;ight of the injured &s;on of Clairville, arre&s;ted the trembling arm of Morenzi. The cautious friends of Albert, al|mo&s;t by force dragged him from the room, and leaving Duval only with Morenzi, fa&s;tened the door upon them, which was guarded on the out|&s;ide by the Count's armed retinue to prevent an e&s;cape. The Baron had caught a view of Far|geon, and recollecting in him the man whom he had employed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the young Henry, he felt a &s;trong and fatal pre&s;age of his own impati|ent fate! His brain was &s;eized with &s;udden de&s;pe|ration; he &s;natched from his pocket a loaded pi&s;|tol, and before Du Val could wre&s;t the weapon from his hand, he lodged the contents in his own head, and fell thus &s;elf-convicted, the devoted &s;acrifice of his con&s;cious and accumulated crimes!</P>
<P>Du Val terrified, flew to a window, and throw|ing open the &s;a&s;h, proclaimed murder, in a voice &s;o audible that he in&s;tantly collected together a concour&s;e of per&s;ons, who, urged by curio&s;ity, &s;urrounded the hou&s;e, and demanded admittance into the room from whence the alarm proceeded: the affrighted landlord likewi&s;e peremptorily claimed liberty to enter; which being granted, on condition that the pri&s;oners &s;hould not be &s;uf|fered
<PB N="248" REF="034525_0251_0FFDC6D164F19C70">
to e&s;cape, they ru&s;hed into the room, found the Baron lifele&s;s, and Du Val leaning over his dead ma&s;ter, with looks expre&s;&s;ive of horror and con&s;ternation. When Albert viewed his fallen enemy, he &s;tood for &s;ome moments wrapt in &s;i|lent wonder&mdash;then exclaimed. "Cha&s;te &s;hade of my departed mother, be appea&s;ed!&mdash;The arm which &s;hed thy guiltle&s;s blood, has in his own re|venged thee, and marks by this dread deed of ju&s;tice the unerring hand of heavenly retribu|tion." He then quitted the apartment, and withdrew with the Count de Bournonville, who had given orders that proper attention to the bo|dy &s;hould be paid. They now con&s;ulted what mea&s;ures they &s;hould take to conceal from Emma a cata&s;trophe &s;o fatal, till they could remove her from this horrid &s;cene.</P>
<P>Bernard determined to go to his daughter's chamber; and undertook with cautious tenderne&s;s to unfold to her the extraordinary circum&s;tance, that Albert and the Count had alighted from their chai&s;e at the moment of Emma's arrival.</P>
<P>Harra&s;&s;ed by the violent agitations of mind and body which &s;he had undergone, Emma had en|joyed for &s;ome time the mo&s;t refre&s;hing and pro|found repo&s;e; from which &s;he was rou&s;ed at length by confu&s;ed &s;ounds of voices that pro|ceeded from below. She &s;tarted up, and recol|lected her perilous &s;ituation, which the height of the &s;un beaming thro the curtains painted in &s;trong colors, &s;he felt her apprehen&s;ions of pur&s;uit re|newed; ha&s;tening therefore to adju&s;t her dre&s;s,

&s;he tied on her &s;traw bonnet, with an intent to rejoin her father, when he &s;uddenly entered, and tenderly enquiring after her health, he found her &s;o apprehen&s;ive of danger from the interval of time, which they had lo&s;t at the inn, that he ven|tured to inform her of Albert's arrival, and of his waiting impatiently to be admitted to her pre&s;ence. The glowing blu&s;h of momentary plea&s;ure animated her lovely cheek, but in&s;tantly retreating, was &s;ucceeded by a deadly palene&s;s. "Ah, my father," &s;aid &s;he, "how &s;hall I avoid him? We mu&s;t not meet no more&mdash;I have taught my heart to renounce each fond idea which it had dared to form. Honor demands the &s;acrifice. Let us fly then from redoubled danger." "O my exalted girl!" interrupted Bernard, while tears of tran&s;port gli&s;tened in his eyes; "Well do&s;t thou de&s;erve the bright reward which now awaits thy courage and thy virtue; de&s;cend with me into the garden, where thou may&s;t guiltle&s;s behold again the worthy Albert, thy faithful lo|ver, and thy de&s;tined hu&s;band. Let me lead thee to him&mdash;he &s;hall re&s;olve thy timid doubts, and bani&s;h that incredulity, which &s;peaks in thy countenance."&mdash;Emma followed her father in &s;i|lent a&s;toni&s;hment, to a &s;mall &s;hurbbery at the end of a &s;erpentine walk, where Albert waited her approach, whom in an in&s;tant &s;he beheld at her feet. "Receive," &s;aid he, with a look of rap|ture, "the heart, the hand of Albert, or rather of Henry de Clairville, the lawful heir of that u&s;urped ca&s;tle and its wide domains. I hail theo mi&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e &s;acred &s;hades, where fir&s;t my

vows of con&s;tancy and love were offered in the atte&s;ting ear of heaven! Within tho&s;e hallowed walls a &s;olemn ceremony &s;hall bind our faith&mdash;the Baron de Morenzi is no more.</P>
<P>"Alas," interrupted Emma, in a tremulous voice, "has Albert then drenched his &s;word in blood!&mdash;do I behold a murderer?"&mdash;"No," re|plied her lover, "Morenzi fell the victim of his con&s;cience, and of heaven's avenging judgment. Accept a guiltle&s;s hand, a con&s;tant heart, and a name un&s;ullied&mdash;The Count de Bournonville at this in&s;tant reached the &s;pot, when the young lo|ver pre&s;ented to him the fair object of his affec|tions, whom he &s;aluted with re&s;pect and cordial|ity, felicitating them both on their approaching happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Events &s;o extraordinary being &s;oon circulated thro the adjacent country, they were received at the ca&s;tle of Clairville with dread and wonder, but in its neighborhood with un&s;eigned tran&s;port and exulting joy. The unlooked-for re&s;toration of a family to which they were &s;trongly attached by every tie of affection, gratitude, and duty, broke at once the galling yoke of that oppre&s;&s;ive &s;lavery, under which the tenants had groaned during the &s;hort reign of an u&s;urper, and promi&s;|ed them at once liberty and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The approach of the young Marquis to the man&s;ion of his ance&s;tors, being announced, he was met &s;ome miles from the ca&s;tle by all the pea|&s;antry, who welcomed and followed him with ac|clamations of unfeigned delight.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="034525_0254_0FFE1BF12C1A0DE8">
The return of Bernard and his beauteous daugh|ter, who were univer&s;ally beloved, was likewi&s;e hailed by their ru&s;tic neighbors, with an hone&s;t &s;implicity of heart, to which that envy is un|known, which &s;o often mingles with the &s;enti|ments of tho&s;e born in the &s;uperior ranks of life; and they cordially congratulated Bernard, on the rewards, which awaited his merits, in the ad|vancement of his virtuous daughter.</P>
<P>As the high and venerable turrets of his native ca&s;tle ro&s;e to the view of Henry, emerging from the thick foliage of the lofty trees by which they were &s;urrounded, a thou&s;and varied emotions fil|led his noble heart: tears to the memory of his unfortunate and reverend parents, rolled down his manly cheek: while gratitude to heaven, for the re&s;toration of tho&s;e rights that empowered him to diffu&s;e happine&s;s around him, &s;oftened his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lial &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Bernard and Emma entered their little dwelling with &s;en&s;ations very different from tho&s;e with which they had &s;o lately quitted it. They waft|ed their mutual thanks to that Being, who&s;e mer|cy had pre&s;erved them from the machinations of a once dreaded, but now vanqui&s;hed enemy. The pro&s;perous fortune that awaited Emma, fill|ed her bo&s;om with humble gratitude; but the low|ly unambitious mind of this child of innocence, impenetrable to pride and vanity, felt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o haugh|ty exultation in the pro&s;pect of her approaching elevation to a rank, the &s;plendor of which, could neither dazzle her eyes, nor mi&s;lead her judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="034525_0255_0FFE1BF40A93D320">
The Marquis de Clairville &s;uffered not the ob|ject of his true and tried affection to remain long in her humble retreat; he reminded Bernard of the promi&s;e which he had given him of his daugh|ter's hand.</P>
<P>The &s;cruples of delicacy, the conflicts of du|ty, and the claims of honor, no longer could be urged as ob&s;tacles to oppo&s;e &s;uch generous wi&s;h|es: &s;ufficiently had Emma proved the con&s;cien|tious virtues of her heart; &s;uperior therefore to the arts of di&s;gui&s;e and affectation, &s;he obeyed her father's &s;ummons to meet her noble lover at the altar; where they exchanged their mutual vows, and were crowned by an approving Provi|dence with that refined happine&s;s, which di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in|tered love and irreproachable honor alone can merit.</P>
