<P>THE &s;ubject &s;uitable to this anniver|&s;ary is determined by its occa&s;ion; a &s;ubject that has long &s;ince been exhau&s;ted, if not exhau&s;ted, many times repeated; con&s;equently is now become like a &s;tory often told. But &s;eeing it cannot claim your attention from its <HI>novelty,</HI> of which the human mind is ever fond, doubtle&s;s it may demand it from its <HI>importance,</HI> which cannot be que&s;tioned by any: For if LIFE, LIBERTY, and PROPERTY are important ble&s;&s;ings, and in continual danger from the rampant lu&s;ts of men, it follows, that that art by which we are en|abled
<PB N="6" REF="011872_0004_0F8740B146788268">
to &s;ecure them, is it&s;elf important. Thus it was viewed by a wi&s;e Legi&s;lature, &s;oon after the &s;ettlement of this country, who, with a de&s;ign of encouraging a military &s;pirit, incorporated this <HI>provincial</HI> Company. Since which it has &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly been countenanced by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank among us. And to day receives the approbation and patronage of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor and Commander in Chief; with many other Gentlemen, who fill the principal &s;eats of Government in the province. Why? becau&s;e of its real utility and importance.&mdash;At the &s;ame time it is to be lamented, that the encouragement afford|ed to this nece&s;&s;ary in&s;titution, is not more general.</P>
<P>THE character of a good &s;oldier is undoubtedly re&s;pectable, and he who &s;u&s;tains it an u&s;eful mem|ber of the community. Let us therefore attend a little to the character it&s;elf&mdash;then &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome things that may tend to revive the &s;pirit of our Militia&mdash;and finally &s;hew the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of it.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age before us is St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s exhortation to <HI>Timothy,</HI> who was then engaged in the propa|gation of the go&s;pel, a mo&s;t hazardous &s;ervice For as its doctrines were new, and directly oppo|&s;ite to the e&s;tabli&s;hed notions of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> he might rea&s;onably have expected, what he after|wards found in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, namely, To make his way through danger and oppo&s;ition. The apo&s;tle therefore reminds him of the good &s;oldier, like whom he would have him act; who having &s;worn allegiance to his Prince, and embarked in his intere&s;t, was ready to encounter any hard|&s;hips,
<PB N="7" REF="011872_0005_0F8740B2989C81B0">
and determined either to conquer, or to die, when called to action. From hence it would be natural to remark, That boldne&s;s, fidelity, and a readine&s;s to endure hardne&s;s, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. But as more agreeable to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, the propo&s;itions already laid down &s;hall be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I. THE character of a <HI>good &s;oldier.</HI> This term is applied both to him who commands, and to tho&s;e who obey. Thus we &s;ay of a renowned General, who at the head of his army had fought valiantly, that he was a good &s;oldier. One of who&s;e prime qualifications</P>
<P>I. Is <HI>loyalty</HI> to his Prince. Him he reveres under the augu&s;t title of Sovereign, and loves under the endearing character of the father of his people: who will neither injure them him&s;elf, nor willingly &s;uffer others to do it. And if at any time an injury is offered, he will rather attribute it to the mi&s;take of the &s;ervants of the Crown, whom it is no trea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e fallible, than entertain any unbecoming thoughts of his King. So firm is he in his affection, that you may as well move the <HI>Alps</HI> as &s;hake his fidelity, while the Prince appears to make the good of his &s;ubjects the grand end of his government.&mdash;Such a conduct has a natural tendency to render the Prince beloved by the peo|ple, who, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, have nothing too dear to part with, if need be, in his &s;ervice. Is intere&s;t wanted? they &s;tand ready to offer it, only let them have the privilege of GIVING it them&s;elves.&mdash;Is it expedient to take the field?
<PB N="8" REF="011872_0006_0F8740ADE00766E0">
&s;timulated by un&s;haken loyalty to a Prince, who&s;e reign is di&s;tingui&s;hed by equity and moderation, they will not he&s;itate to offer Him their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;When this is the ca&s;e, happy the King, and no le&s;s happy the people.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould a &s;u&s;picion take place, be it well or ill founded, that the Sovereign is inclined to favour oppre&s;&s;ion, it will at once tend to le&s;&s;en that affection. And &s;hould &s;uch &s;u&s;picion become a confident per&s;ua&s;ion &s;upported by facts, the greate&s;t indifference, if not aver&s;ion, &s;ucceeds that loyalty which formerly had warmed their hearts. This remark was exemplified in the tyrannical reign of <HI>James</HI> II. who&s;e &s;ubjects were &s;o far from ju&s;tify|ing his conduct, that it became intolerable; hence they received the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with open arms, and readily a&s;&s;i&s;ted Him when He came to free them from the yoke. What could the un|happy King do when de&s;erted by the people, and ju&s;tly obnoxious to their re&s;entment? Concious of his mal-treatment of them, and fearing the con&s;e|quences, He made his e&s;cape to <HI>France.</HI> An event this that ought ever to be remembred with gratitude to God, and affection to that brave Prince, who under HIM delivered the Briti&s;h nation from impending ruin; and e&s;tabli&s;hed the royal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion in the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of HANOVER.&mdash;Which may God long pre&s;erve, as the bulwark of the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and the &s;ecurity of our happy con&s;titution.&mdash;And let all the people &s;ay, Amen.</P>
<P>FROM hence it is apparent, that the happine&s;s and &s;afety of a Prince, depend on the loyalty and
<PB N="9" REF="011872_0007_0F8740B31D1BC458">
affection of the people: and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> loyalty, a ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualification in a good &s;oldier, can only be &s;ecured by moderation and ju&s;tice. It is therefore in the power of a Sovereign, either to alienate the affections of the people from Him; or to attach them to his intere&s;t. If He con&s;ults their good, and is tender of their rights and privileges, they love and honour Him; but if He appears tyran|nic, and does not regard them, they become aver&s;e to Him: mutual confidence is entirely de&s;troyed. This is a mo&s;t lamentable condition for a kingdom to be in; <HI>divided again&s;t it&s;elf,</HI> in&s;piration a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>it cannot &s;tand.</HI> In &s;uch a &s;ituation <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are the peace makers,</HI> who exert all their influence; and make u&s;e of every probable method to heal the breaches and re&s;tore union to the nation. Their names will be had in perpetual remembrance. Ages yet unborn &s;hall call them ble&s;&s;ed. While the men who love to &s;tir up &s;trife by &s;owing the &s;eeds of di&s;cord, &s;hall be remembred with reproach.</P>
<P N="2">2. I PASS to ob&s;erve that another e&s;&s;ential part of the character under con&s;ideration, is <HI>fortitude.</HI> The &s;acred writers repeatedly de&s;cribe the men of the &s;word by &s;aying, that they were <HI>mighty men of valour.</HI>&mdash;Fortitude is a moral virtue, by which a man is enabled to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf in a time of threatening difficulty, and to act according to the dictates of rea&s;on. Of all men in the world, none &s;tand more in need of this virtue than tho&s;e who are called to the field of battle; for <HI>every battle of the warrior is with confu&s;ed noi&s;e, and garments rolled in blood.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="011872_0008_0F87415B1E07D9D8">
Let us &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves on an eminence, ob|&s;erving the conduct of two armies. They form in order of battle; every officer takes his po&s;t. Thus formed they march towards each other ready for engaging, with drums beating, and colours fly|ing, while their burni&s;hed arms dazzle the &s;ight.&mdash;Now death &s;tares them in the face. What &s;hall that man do who is devoid of this important vir|tue? for this is the hour to try his courage. The pu&s;illanimous will quake with fear, his face gather palene&s;s, his knees &s;mite one again&s;t another, and &s;upremely anxious for his own &s;afety,&mdash;<HI>Feels a thou&s;and deaths in fearing one.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Young.</NOTE>&mdash;But the men of fortitude, a perfect contra&s;t to the former, in hope of victory begin the fight, and &s;tand like brazen walls again&s;t the fierce&s;t on&s;ets of the enemy; and with undaunted bravery maintain the conte&s;t, until they either conquer, or die.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> had obtained a victory over the <HI>Roman</HI> army, under the command of <HI>Publius Va|lerius Laevinus,</HI> he walked among the &s;lain, whom when he &s;aw with &s;ternne&s;s in their countenances, although dead, is &s;aid to have held up his hands to heaven crying out, "I could have been ma&s;ter of the world, if &s;uch &s;oldiers had fallen to my &s;hare." A noble character!&mdash;</P>
<P>FORTITUDE is e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e who command. They are not only to lay the plan of operation, but to &s;ee it executed. They are to head the troops, and lead them forth to the fight; taking a part in the hard&s;hips and dangers them|&s;elves. And much depends on the conduct of the
<PB N="11" REF="011872_0009_0F87415DCDB14F60">
commanding officers. If they appear intrepid, and on any hazardous enterprize pu&s;h forward, the troops are a&s;hamed to be tardy; the fire kindles, and pre&s;ently runs through the whole body like a &s;hock of electricity. It was enough with the <HI>Ro|man</HI> &s;oldiers that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was in &s;ight; they then &s;tretched every nerve, each man was anxious to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in the pre&s;ence of his General, that he might obtain his plaudit. Death was for|gotten; <HI>Cae&s;ar'</HI>s prai&s;e was all.</P>
<P>AT the time of action, example in this re&s;pect, as in many others, has a powerful influence; e&s;pe|cially the example of officers who are happy enough to be beloved by the men. On them they fix their eyes, and are ready to follow or to defend them.&mdash;But &s;hould the Gentlemen who command, be de&s;titute of this important virtue, and in a time of danger act the de&s;picable part of coward; they &s;tain their character with indelible infamy, lo&s;e the day on which, perhaps, the pre&s;ent all depends; and leave the field the place of triumph for their enemies. Not &s;o the men of valour. They di&s;|charge the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them with fidelity; and choo&s;e rather to die lamented, than to live and bear the load of univer&s;al contempt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

<Q>That he fir&s;t received a wound in the wri&s;t; but that he might not di&s;courage his troops, he wrapped it up in his handkerchief, and encourag|ed his men to advance; &s;oon after he received a|nother ball in his belly; this al&s;o he di&s;&s;embled, and exerted him&s;elf as before; when he received a third in his brea&s;t, under which he at la&s;t &s;unk, and &s;uffered him&s;elf, unwillingly, to be carried behind the ranks. As he lay &s;truggling with the angui&s;h and weakne&s;s of three grievous wounds, he &s;eemed only &s;ollicitous about the fortune of the battle. He begged one who attended, to &s;upport him to view the field; but as he found that the approach of death had dimmed, and confu&s;ed his &s;ight, he de&s;ired an officer, who was by him, to give him an account of what he &s;aw. The officer an&s;wered, that the enemy &s;eemed broken; he repeated his que&s;tion a few minutes after, with much anxiety, when he was told that the enemy was totally routed, and that they fled in all parts.

<P N="3">3. BUT what advantage could ari&s;e from the mo&s;t unfeigned loyalty, and undaunted bravery, without a competent <HI>knowledge</HI> of the art of war? The&s;e alone would be no &s;ecurity to the Prince or to our|&s;elves. The former would lead us to re&s;ent every indignity offered to his royal per&s;on or govern|ment; the latter would be attended with eagerne&s;s to defend Him and our&s;elves, and to cha&s;tize the
<PB N="13" REF="011872_0011_0F87415FE3604640">
common enemy: but without a proper acquaintance with the be&s;t methods of defence, we &s;hould be likely to fall an ea&s;y prey to the men, whom ju&s;tice calls us to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>A GREAT degree of boldne&s;s will be productive of ra&s;h actions, if the per&s;ons are not at the &s;ame time well acquainted with the military art. It is a matter of importance <HI>when, where,</HI> and in <HI>what manner</HI> to attack an enemy. The&s;e things mu&s;t be determined by the judgment of experienced officers. Hundreds of lives have been &s;acrificed, and the bat|tle lo&s;t through the ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome, who have had more re&s;olution than knowledge. On the other hand, victories have been gained in the mid&s;t of many improbabilities, and doubtful circum&s;tances, by means of the &s;kill of the troops. This was the ca&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> army when &s;uddenly attacked by the people of <HI>Hainault,</HI> who were brave &s;oldiers. The <HI>Romans</HI> had not even time to fix their &s;tand|ards, to put on their helmets, uncover their targets, or make any nece&s;&s;ary preparations for engaging: yet &s;o great was their &s;kill and experience in the art of war, that a hi&s;torian a&s;&s;ures us, they could as ea&s;ily tell what ought to be done, as if they had been commanded by an experienced officer.</P>
<P>WE find by the &s;acred hi&s;tory, that <HI>Abraham</HI> not only taught his dome&s;tics the fear of God, but the art of war. For when <HI>Lot</HI> his brother's &s;on was led away captive by the Kings who had plun|dered <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah, he armed his trained &s;ervants born in his hou&s;e, three hundred and eigh|teen, and pur&s;ued them, and re&s;cued</HI> Lot. Ob&s;erve that <HI>Abraham</HI> had a &s;mall army of well-di&s;ciplined
<PB N="14" REF="011872_0012_0F87416082105200">
troops in his own hou&s;e. He knew that he was in danger from his enemies; and concluded that it was perfectly compatible with the character of a good man, to put him&s;elf into the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence, and if called to it, to repel force by force.</P>
<P>THIS preparation he had made in his family long before the captivity of <HI>Lot:</HI> hence when that event happened, he could immediately collect his &s;ervants into a body, who had been trained to martial ex|erci&s;es, and pur&s;ue his enemies. They were not, when a pre&s;&s;ing emergency called for their &s;peedy and re&s;olute a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to be initiated in the art of war; no, this they had been taught before; and therefore were ready to accompany their leader, and to <HI>venture their lives in the high places of the field.</HI>&mdash;A man of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s amiable character is worthy of imitation!</P>
<P>IN what a re&s;pectable condition was the militia at the time of <HI>David'</HI>s acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of <HI>I&s;|rael;</HI> a narrative of which we have 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12. Of the <HI>Gadites</HI> it is &s;aid to their la&s;ting honour, that <HI>they were men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, who could handle &s;hield and buckler, who&s;e faces were like the faces of lions, and were &s;wift as roes upon the mountains.</HI> And the gene|ral character of tho&s;e who went up to <HI>Hebron</HI> to <HI>David</HI> to make him King, is, that they were <HI>expert in war;</HI> without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to be a <HI>good &s;oldier.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. To the preceding qualifications mu&s;t be ad|ded, an <HI>ability</HI> and <HI>readine&s;s</HI> to endure hardne&s;s. St. <HI>Paul</HI> particularly mentions this part of the mi|litary
<PB N="15" REF="011872_0013_0F87416124242AB0">
character, and exhorts <HI>Timothy</HI> to learn it, &s;eeing he was called to fight the good fight of faith.</P>
<P>SOLDIERS will be inevitably called to pa&s;s thro' a &s;cene of difficulties. How can it be otherwi&s;e, when the cau&s;e of their country renders it nece&s;&s;ary for them to leave their comfortable habitations, and agreeable connections, and take the field?&mdash;Some|times, in order to obtain an advantage of the ene|my, they are obliged to make forced marches; to travel day and night; by which means they are not only &s;ubjected to great fatigues, but the lo&s;s of &s;leep; and have no time to attend to their regular meals, but are glad to catch the coar&s;e mor&s;els as they can. At other times, when apprehen&s;ive of immediate danger, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for their own &s;afety to lie all night on their arms; and to be ready at a moment's warning to engage in bat|tle. And when the engagement proves long and ob&s;tinate, their fatigues are greater than can well be imagined, occa&s;ioned by want of refre&s;hment and continual action. Be&s;ides which they are un|avoidably expo&s;ed to all the inclemencies of the weather.&mdash;From this imperfect account of the hard&s;hips of a military life, it is manife&s;t that men can no more be good &s;oldiers, without learning <HI>to endure hardne&s;s,</HI> than without valour or &s;kill in arms.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT may be proper al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that there is a due <HI>&s;ubordination</HI> in <HI>military,</HI> as well as in <HI>civil</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hments. Some are called to command; others are bound in duty to obey. And without &s;uch &s;ubordination, neither the &s;tate nor the militia could ever be in reputable circum&s;tances. Were
<PB N="16" REF="011872_0014_0F874161DFDD2E48">
there no per&s;ons clothed with authority, there would be none to call delinquents to an account; con&s;e|quently every one would do what &s;eemeth right in his own eyes.</P>
<P>REGULARITY in the militia is allowed to be ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: but how &s;hall it be attained, if the &s;oldiers do not pay a proper regard to the au|thority of their officers? Who, it is taken for granted, will command nothing that is incompati|ble with rea&s;on, or the laws of God. If they &s;hould, obedience in&s;tantly becomes a <HI>crime</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>duty.</HI></P>
<P>I MAY therefore with propriety on this occa&s;ion, remind my brethren who are called to bear arms in their re&s;pective companies, that obedience to their officers is an important part of their duty, and e&s;&s;ential to the character of a good &s;oldier.&mdash;It is mentioned to the prai&s;e of the children of <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> that <HI>they had under&s;tanding to know what</HI> I&s;rael <HI>ought to do: the heads of them were two hundred,</HI> and ALL THEIR BRETHREN WERE AT THEIR COM|MAND.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 12. 32.</NOTE> May the &s;ame thing ever be predicated of the numerous militia of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Militia of this Province con&s;i&s;ts of 85000.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Gentlemen who &s;u&s;tain commi&s;&s;ions are our brethren; the&s;e they have accepted, not from any pro&s;pect of per&s;onal emolument; on the con|trary, they are at a con&s;iderable expence; but it is to be pre&s;umed, with a de&s;ign of encouraging a martial &s;pirit. Let us, my fellow-&s;oldiers, concur with them in the u&s;ual de&s;ign, by yielding that
<PB N="17" REF="011872_0015_0F874162B09AEEA0">

<P N="6">6. SECRECY and <HI>di&s;patch.</HI> The&s;e have been found to facilitate many military atchievements. The plan hath been laid, and the enemy attacked before they have had the lea&s;t intimation of the de|&s;ign, and thereby the conque&s;t hath been ea&s;y, and with the lo&s;s of but few lives. Whereas had they been previou&s;ly informed of their danger, they would no doubt have been in readine&s;s, and the at|tempt either fru&s;trated, or attended with the mo&s;t horrid &s;laughter.

So, however &s;ati&s;factorily to the Coloni&s;ts the pre&s;ent di&s;putes may terminate, they will not forget the names of tho&s;e, who were the cau&s;e of troops being quartered in this Metropolis in a time of peace; nor the errand on which they came: but a|bove all the horrid Ma&s;&s;acre of &s;o many of our bre|thren.

<P>MEN cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, however differing in political principles, will allow, as a dictate of rea&s;on, humanity and religion, that the&s;e things ought not to be &s;o. The men of the &s;word are to defend, not to de&s;troy their fellow-&s;ubjects; to &s;ecure, not wa&s;te their property.</P>
<P N="8">8. AFTER all that has been &s;aid, the character would remain incomplete, were we not to call in the aids of religion; by which we are taught as an important preliminary, to &s;eek direction of heaven when about to engage in war. And when &s;ati&s;fied that there is ju&s;t cau&s;e of taking up arms, in&s;tead of

ru&s;hing forth to meet the armed men under the influence of &s;elf-confidence, to obtain a character, or from a thir&s;t for blood and &s;poil; it &s;hews us that the glory of God &s;hould be the ultimate end of all our actions. And that we &s;hould go to the field as <HI>David,</HI> that pious warriour, went to meet <HI>Goliah. I come to thee,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>in the name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of the armies of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>whom thou ba&s;t defied.</HI> He did not tru&s;t in him&s;elf, but in HIM who had delivered him from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the bear.</P>
<P>ABOVE all, of how great importance is it that &s;oldiers &s;hould have &s;omething to remove their fears of death, &s;eeing they are called to the mo&s;t perilous enterprizes. When they face an enemy they can|not tell but that the next di&s;charge will number their bodies with the &s;lain, and &s;end their immortal &s;ouls to the world of &s;pirits.&mdash;Here then religion is <HI>the one thing needful.</HI>&mdash;Are there any in the camp under awful apprehen&s;ions of the wrath of God for &s;in; who fear their enemy left they &s;hould be cut down in unbelief? The religion of Je&s;us, a glori|ous reality, &s;ets before them a method in which God can be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of them who believe in his dear Son. And at the &s;ame time opens to the faithful a tran&s;porting pro&s;pect beyond the grave, of an infinitely happier &s;tate of being, in which the nations will learn war no more. They who believe the&s;e divine &s;entiments, and are in|tere&s;ted in them, may go to the field of battle, &s;aying, <HI>To live is Chri&s;t; and to die is gain.</HI> For <HI>they know that if the earthly hou&s;e of this taber|nacle were di&s;&s;olved, they have a building of God, an

hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</HI> Verily there are no &s;entiments &s;o immediately cal|culated to make them who believe them <HI>wax vali|ant in fight.</HI></P>
<P>ON the contrary, if the &s;oldiers are in a &s;tate of impenitence, and have no part, or lot in this matter; they may well tremble at the &s;ound of the trumpet and the alarm of war; not barely with fear of lo&s;ing pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, but of being in|gulfed in future mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>II. I Now beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome things with a de&s;ign of reviving the &s;pirit of our militia.</P>
<P>THE founding this Ancient and Honourable Company by the Legi&s;lature, the encouragement they have continually given it, and the many laws that have been pa&s;&s;ed re&s;pecting the military, con|vince us, as before ob&s;erved, that it hath at every period, &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the province, appeared a matter of importance to our wi&s;e&s;t men, that the militia &s;hould be kept in a re&s;pectable condition. After all &s;omething &s;eems to be &s;till warning&mdash;We have degenerated in a great de|gree from,</P>
<P>I. THE noble &s;pirit of our ance&s;tors. They, under the influence of love to God, and his divine religion, &s;ought an a&s;ylum in the&s;e wilds of <HI>America</HI> from every &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion. They left their native land, and many delights of life, and came to the&s;e &s;hores in order to enjoy that liberty wherewith Chri&s;t had made them free. Here they had to en|counter with all the unavoidable hard&s;hips of a new
<PB N="21" REF="011872_0019_0F8741671DEB83F0">
and uncultivated country: and what was &s;till wor&s;e, with the tribes of barbarous Indians, who&s;e tender mercies were cruelty. Many and bloody were the wars they had with the&s;e inhuman foes. They were called to endure hardne&s;s as good &s;oldiers; and like <HI>Nehemiah'</HI>s workmen, to hold a weapon in one hand, while they wrought with the other. Every man had his &s;word on his thigh becau&s;e of fear in the night.&mdash;While they di&s;covered a tender concern for the honour of God, and appeared to have religion at heart, they fought bravely on many hazardous occa&s;ions: thereby making it evident, that they thought the character of a <HI>good &s;oldier,</HI> was not repugnant to that of a <HI>real chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>To particularize all the in&s;tances of their fortitude would be unnece&s;&s;ary; &s;eeing it may be taken for granted that you are not ignorant of a hi&s;tory, in which you are &s;o immediately concerned.</P>
<P>THAT the art of war was taught, and a military &s;pirit promoted from time to time by our prede|ce&s;&s;ors, our appearance in the hou&s;e of God this day, is an evidence. And on many occa&s;ions, when his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice required it, <HI>they have jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.</HI>&mdash;To whom, under God, will you attribute the important conque&s;t of <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> in 1745? To a body of troops collected from the provinces of <HI>New-England.</HI> They were <HI>militia;</HI> men who volunta|rily left their various occupations, to encounter the hard&s;hips and dangers of a campaign; not exceed|ing 4000 in number. This handful of brave men, with the &s;miles of heaven on their arms, conquered a city, which, &s;ays one, in the opinion of its Go|vernor

<P>THE readine&s;s of this people to take the field was di&s;covered in 1746, when apprehen&s;ive of an in|va&s;ion by the <HI>French.</HI> The alarm having &s;pread through the country, our brethren from various parts in great multitudes, ready for the fight, crowded this Metropolis.&mdash;And as a recent in&s;tance of the loyalty, and military &s;pirit of our inhabitants, we may remember, that this province alone fur|ni&s;hed his Maje&s;ty with 7000 men annually, for three years<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The years 1758, 1759, 1760.</NOTE> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying on the war in <HI>America.</HI> Brave men have lived in <HI>New-England;</HI> brave men no doubt &s;till live.&mdash;May every brea&s;t be fired with emulation to maintain the &s;ame martial &s;pirit. And as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;aid to his army in a very critical &s;ituation, not having time to ad|dre&s;s

them as u&s;ual, "Forget not your former bravery;" &s;o might it be &s;aid with propriety to our militia, if they were a&s;&s;embled in this place to day, Forget not the bravery of your ance&s;tors, but diligently labour to cultivate the &s;ame &s;pirit. Ble&s;&s;ed be God we are not called to un&s;heath the &s;word, and to take the field at pre&s;ent; but a time may come, when his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and the cau&s;e of our country may demand our help.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT behoves us therefore, as we wi&s;h to &s;ee the militia rai&s;ed to its former glory, to be punctilious in our attendance on the &s;tated days of training. Four times a year, as required by law, can never be deemed a hard&s;hip. In&s;tead of being <HI>le&s;s,</HI> would it not be for our advantage to appear <HI>more</HI> fre|quently in the field? And when there, to &s;pend more time in going through the various exerci&s;es? Practice makes perfect. How can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a regiment that meets but once a quarter, and when they do meet, &s;tay no longer than to an&s;wer the law and &s;ave their fines, will ever make a pro|ficiency in the military art? It was the cu&s;tom for|merly for the troops to &s;pend the whole, or the greate&s;t part of the day in the field; allowing them&s;elves a &s;hort time only for nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;h|ment. The revival, and continuance of this practice would, in all probability, have a u&s;eful tendency.</P>
<P>CONTINUING &s;o many hours in the field, it may be alledged, is <HI>fatiguing.</HI> Puny &s;oldiers, if any &s;uch there be, who have not yet learned to endure hardne&s;s. He who makes &s;uch an objection, if it is po&s;&s;ible any among us &s;hould make it, will blu&s;h when he con&s;iders what fatigues and hard&s;hips his
<PB N="24" REF="011872_0022_0F87416C6BED02A8">
progenitors endured, in their long and bloody wars with Savages; and on other occa&s;ions when called to the field of battle. If we cannot endure the fatigues of one day's campaign in the fight of our very habitations, what would be the con&s;e|quence, if we &s;hould be called to march miles from home, every man with his knap-&s;ack on his back, and there to fight an enemy? Let us inure our|&s;elves to the&s;e fatigues now, that we may be pre|pared for greater, if called to endure them.</P>
<P>THE pro&s;pect would be truly encouraging, if our brethren in general were ambitious to appear in the field on the&s;e occa&s;ions, well accoutred, their arms in order, and nothing wanting; each man anxious to rival his brother &s;oldier. A laudable ambition this, and of great utility in the militia. How far it prevails every one may judge for him|&s;elf.&mdash;The Honorable Company who have called us to the hou&s;e of the Lord, to &s;anctify their arms by the word of God and prayer, merit the prai&s;es of their brethren; together with the re&s;pectable <HI>Train of Artillery.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Company in this Town commanded by Captain ADINO PADDOCK.</NOTE> Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are a few Com|panies in &s;ome of the towns in the Province, com|manded by Gentlemen who po&s;&s;e&s;s the true martial &s;pirit, which are an honour to them&s;elves, and their officers. From hence we learn what they all might be, if equal pains were taken by tho&s;e who are appointed to the command.</P>
<P N="3">3. To which indeed mu&s;t be added as indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, the <HI>concurrence</HI> of the troops. For however ready the commanding officers may be to
<PB N="25" REF="011872_0023_0F87416D1FEAE600">
attend to their duty, if the troops do not chearfully concur with them, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould ever make a reputable appearance in the field. The want of which at pre&s;ent, may, with all be|coming deference to this venerable A&s;&s;embly, be deemed one grand cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent declining &s;tate of the militia.</P>
<P>IN this town there are above 2000 men able to bear arms; many of whom are excu&s;ed from duty, except in ca&s;es of alarm: others, inattentive to the importance of a well di&s;ciplined militia, chu&s;e rather to pay their fines than appear in the field. Permit me with mode&s;ty to a&s;k, How it is po&s;&s;ible, things continuing thus, that the regiment &s;hould appear either complete or re&s;pectable?&mdash;Whereas, would gentlemen of reputation among us, &s;et the good example, it would render our militia reputable, and tend to increa&s;e the number of volunteers in the &s;ervice. Hence it is in their power in a great de|gree, to &s;trengthen the things which remain in this re&s;pect, and &s;eem ready to die. This among other things, would be an evidence of a truly public &s;pirit, and an honour to tho&s;e who &s;hould lead the way.</P>
<P N="4">4. I WILL only add under this particular, That it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to exclude <HI>luxury</HI> from the camp. The plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of our an|ce&s;tors with re&s;pect to their manner of living, may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have contributed much, to that greatne&s;s of mind which they often di&s;co|vered. Luxury tends to enervate the body, to fill it with di&s;ea&s;e, to render men effeminate, and unfit them for every manly enterprize.</P>
<P>IN what a mi&s;erable condition did <HI>Albinus</HI> deliver up the army to <HI>Metellus,</HI> upon his receiving the command, after the &s;hameful treaty of <HI>Aulus</HI> with
<PB N="26" REF="011872_0024_0F87416E2C3CFB50">
<HI>Jugurtha.</HI> They had been &s;poiled by the methods of indulgence; and were not di&s;po&s;ed for action. Before that brave Commander could attack <HI>Jugur|tha,</HI> he was obliged to break them of old cu&s;toms, and to inure them to hard&s;hips. For this purpo&s;e, <HI>Salu&s;t</HI> informs us, he ordered out of the camp all the &s;upports of idlene&s;s&mdash;He al&s;o marched his army daily to the right and left; obliged them to fortify the camp with a rampart and ditch, ju&s;t as if an enemy was near, &amp;c. Thus in a little time they became fit for &s;ervice. Like cau&s;es will produce like effects. Luxury is a &s;oldier's greate&s;t enemy&mdash;And even &s;hould we never be called to the field, the bani&s;hment of this vice from among us, would be attended with great advantages to us as citizens.</P>
<P>III. IT remains that we advert a little to the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e warlike preparations, even in a time of peace.</P>
<P>SELF-DEFENCE is an e&s;tabli&s;hed law of our na|ture, and a fir&s;t dictate of common &s;en&s;e; which has never been &s;uper&s;eded by any written law of God, or by the religion of Je&s;us. During the old te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation, wars were entred into and carried on by divine authority and direction; which appears in many in&s;tances. And &s;ome of the be&s;t of men were the greate&s;t &s;oldiers, as <HI>Abra|ham, Jo&s;hua, David,</HI> &amp;c. And even in the New-Te&s;tament, we learn by implication, though not by any po&s;itive precept, that what we under&s;tand by <HI>defen&s;ive war</HI> is lawful.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;oldiers a&s;ked <HI>John,</HI> what they &s;hould do? he did not take the opportunity, which was very favourable, to inform them that their employment was unlawful; but rather directs them to <HI>do violence to no man:</HI> meaning that they &s;hould not be ready, upon every little, in&s;ufficient
<PB N="27" REF="011872_0025_0F87416E9CE1FF48">
provocation to draw the &s;word and wound a fel|low &s;ubject. And farther exhorts them <HI>to be con|tent with their wages;</HI> which plainly implies a continuance in their employment.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Peter</HI> went to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> a devout cen|turion, or captain of an hundred men by divine command,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 10.</NOTE> we do not read that he made any at|tempt to convince him, that the military character was incompatible with the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Sure we are that this in&s;pired apo&s;tle, would not have left the pious centurion under the influence of a &s;ingle error. His &s;ilence therefore in this matter, implies that a man may be at the &s;ame time a real di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t and a good &s;oldier.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame thing is taught us by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. <HI>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my di&s;ciples fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the</HI> Jews.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John 18. 36.</NOTE> The rea&s;on why they were not &s;uffered to defend their ma&s;ter, was, his kingdom was &s;pi|ritual but he declares, had it been temporal, they would have fought in his defence, agreable to the maxims of earthly Potentates. Therein teaching us, that to defend our&s;elves is lawful. And to be in readine&s;s to do it,</P>
<P N="1">1. BECOMES nece&s;&s;ary from this &s;ingle con&s;ide|ration, <HI>That tho&s;e lu&s;ts which are the grand &s;ource of wars and fightings &s;till remain.</HI> Fallen human nature is the &s;ame now it ever was.&mdash;Different men may indeed be under the influence of different vicious pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as ambition, revenge, avarice, &amp;c. Yet the&s;e various lu&s;ts when indulged, naturally tend to di&s;turb the repo&s;e of others, and to bring on acts of ho&s;tility; either between members of the &s;ame community, or neighbouring &s;tates. An <HI>ambiti|ous</HI> Prince, thinking his dominions too contracted,
<PB N="28" REF="011872_0026_0F8741718484DC40">
may enter into a war with his neighbours in order to acquire a greater extent of territory. Another under the influence of <HI>avarice</HI> may take up arms in expectation of filling his coffers.&mdash;A third hav|ing tried his fortune in war, and been repeatedly defeated, concludes a peace with the conquerors only with a view of repairing his lo&s;&s;es, and of aug|menting his navy and army; that at &s;ome future period he may have it in his power to be avenged on them. This we have abundant rea&s;on to believe is the ca&s;e with our natural enemies the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> over whom, through the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord of Ho&s;ts on our arms, we have <HI>triumphed gloriou&s;ly.</HI> Witne&s;s the &s;eries of victories obtained by the Briti&s;h forces during the la&s;t war. Their hearts glow with revenge; in peace they prepare for war; and no doubt will endeavour to take an advantage of us. It is po&s;&s;ible therefore, that we may be invaded, though at pre&s;ent &s;ome may think it a remote, and an uncertain event; con&s;equently it becomes us to be ready to make a vigorous, and a &s;kilful oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>IF we may judge from the common conduct of too many in our own nation, two pernicious max|ims &s;eem to be adopted. The fir&s;t is, <HI>That all at|tention to the art of war may be laid a&s;ide in time of peace.</HI> The other is, <HI>That our dependance in a time of war is to be on the &s;tanding army.</HI> Both ought to be exploded, as they tend in their influence to prevent the militia of the kingdom from ever be|coming re&s;pectable. Be&s;ides, we have rea&s;on to ex|pect that our &s;tate of tranquility will &s;ooner or later be di&s;turbed. Thus it has been in days pa&s;t; thus it may be again. Let us only &s;uppo&s;e that the e|nemy &s;hould attack us in the beginning of a war; in what a defencele&s;s condition &s;hould we be, if our
<PB N="29" REF="011872_0027_0F874172D9843A00">
fortifications are &s;uffered to crumble to pieces, and the u&s;e of arms is neglected?</P>
<P>A STATE of &s;ecurity is both &s;hameful and haz|ardous; of this we have a &s;triking in&s;tance in the ca&s;e of <HI>Lai&s;h. They dwelt carele&s;s&mdash;quiet and &s;e|cure, and there was no magi&s;trate in the land to put them to &s;hame in any thing.</HI> The con&s;equence was, that they fell an ea&s;y prey to their enemies.</P>
<P>To depend wholly on a &s;tanding army, is al&s;o prepo&s;terous. For however u&s;eful they have been in time of war, and may be again; we will &s;uppo&s;e that any part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions &s;hould be invaded at a juncture, when the army was at too great a di&s;tance to come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; or when their united force was nece&s;&s;ary el&s;ewhere: what would be the con&s;equence? Doubtle&s;s the Prince mu&s;t &s;uffer the lo&s;s of that part of his dominions, through the want of a well di&s;ciplined militia.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the inhabitants of a country have every thing dear to fight for. They have lives, liberties, e&s;tates, wives, children, &amp;c. If they will not labour to defend the&s;e, they cannot be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;pi|rit of men.</P>
<P N="2">2. I MAY farther ob&s;erve, that whatever renders us <HI>formidable</HI> to our enemies, and tends to prevent an inva&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary. And nothing will do this more effectually, than to keep our fortifications and militia in good order.</P>
<P>IF a Prince meditates a blow again&s;t a city or country, the fir&s;t inquiries generally are, How is it as to natural &s;ituation? What the condition of its fortifications? What the number of its militia? Are they a &s;ecure effeminate people, or bold and enterprizing? Ignorant of, or well acquainted with the u&s;e of arms? The&s;e circum&s;tances, of which he can ea&s;ily gain intelligence, determine him whether
<PB N="30" REF="011872_0028_0F874173C60D6870">
or no to attack it; and if he does, what force will be &s;ufficient? If upon the whole, it is found to be well fortified, and inhabited by a people of a mar|tial &s;pirit, the&s;e con&s;iderations may happily prevent their being di&s;turbed.&mdash;But &s;hould they be invaded notwith&s;tanding, they will be in a condition to de|fend them&s;elves. A well-di&s;ciplined militia is the beauty, and under God, the &s;ecurity of a country.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE PREMISES naturally lead us to reflect on, and bewail the mi&s;erable condition of this apo|&s;tate world. How is human nature fallen from its pri&s;tine glory! <HI>God made man upright, but he hath &s;ought out many inventions.</HI> In his &s;tate of innocence he &s;u&s;tained the moral image of his God, enjoyed peace with HIM, compo&s;ure in his mind, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t friendly temper. Benevolence was written on his heart as with the point of a diamond. He knew not what it was to be tormented with ambiti|on, covetou&s;ne&s;s, or any other of the vicious pa&s;&s;ions. But the crown has fallen from his head! He has pa&s;&s;ed, horrid tran&s;ition! into a &s;tate of rebellion again&s;t heaven; and is &s;adly influenced by that ty|rant <HI>lu&s;t;</HI> from whence come wars and fightings. And the &s;criptures &s;peak of this revolt in terms of univer&s;ality&mdash;<HI>The WHOLE WORLD lieth in wick|edne&s;s&mdash;ALL have &s;inned.</HI> And this horrid thing which extends to <HI>ALL,</HI> hath changed a paradi&s;e into a field of blood. And man who once appeared in dignity is intirely de&s;poiled of it: to &s;ecure our&s;elves again&s;t the effects of who&s;e malevolence, we are reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of having every man his &s;word on his thigh.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT follows, that whatever is calculated to &s;ubdue this evil and bitter thing, has a tendency to pre&s;erve peace among&s;t men. May I be permitted to &s;ug|ge&s;t, that this matter more immediately belongeth

to my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, whom the great Head of the Church hath entru&s;ted with his go&s;pel, which is the only effectual remedy again&s;t the dominion of lu&s;t. It is theirs e&s;pecially as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to <HI>wre&s;tle again&s;t fle&s;h and blood, again&s;t principalities, again&s;t powers, again&s;t the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world, and all &s;pi|ritual wickedne&s;s;</HI> knowing that <HI>the weapons of their warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down &s;trong holds, ca&s;ting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it|&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t.</HI> It is theirs to propagate the doctrines of the cro&s;s, which are the wi&s;dom and power of God; and &s;o far as they are really believed, they become influ|ential in preventing animo&s;ities and contentions. <HI>The wi&s;dom that is from above, is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated, full of mercy, and good fruits.</HI> If all men were under the influence of the religion of the New-Te&s;tament, wars would cea&s;e to the ends of the earth. But we know by &s;orrowful experience that this is not the ca&s;e, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. THEREFORE the art of war is &s;till nece&s;&s;ary; and con&s;equently the <HI>continuance</HI> of this <HI>Antient and Honorable Artillery-Company,</HI> is as expedient as its <HI>original in&s;titution.</HI> It was founded we know in the infancy of the province, when infe&s;ted by cruel In|dians, as a &s;chool to train up officers for the militia; &s;ome of whom have played the man for the people and the cities of their God, and though now num|bered with the dead, they are remembred with af|fection. The appearances of this day convince us, that the &s;pirit with which they were animated is not extinct; it lives in a degree in their po&s;terity, who

breathe in the &s;ame air, and have drank deep into the &s;ame principles; though alas it has too much decayed. Neverthele&s;s, thus approved and encou|raged by His Honor our Commander in Chief, in who&s;e hands the power of the militia is, we hope for its abundant pro&s;perity. And that the Gentle|men of this important in&s;titution, will per&s;evere with unremitting diligence in their laudable endeavours to promote military knowledge. May they go on and pro&s;per, and the Lord be with them.</P>
<P>THEY will particularly remember while thus em|ployed, that religion is the grand accompli&s;hment. The <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> and the <HI>good &s;oldier</HI> are not incon&s;i&s;t|ent with each other. It is of the la&s;t importance that they <HI>have on the whole armour of God: having the loins girt about with truth, and having on the brea&s;t plate of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the feet &s;hod with the preparation of the go&s;pel; above all taking the &s;hield of faith, that they may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked; al&s;o the helmet of &s;alvation, and the &s;word of the Spirit, which is the word of God&mdash;thus will they be able to with&s;tand in the evil day.</HI></P>
<P>IN fine. We have cau&s;e of rejoicing, that how|ever wars and fightings may be expected in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of things, that a period will come, when peace &s;hall flow down like a river. Then <HI>the people &s;hall beat their &s;words into plough-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning books: nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more. And the kingdoms of this world &s;hall become the kingdoms of our God and of his Chri&s;t; and He &s;hall reign forever.</HI> To whom be glory and domi|nion world without end. AMEN.</P>
