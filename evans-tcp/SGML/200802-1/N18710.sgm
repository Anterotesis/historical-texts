<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTHEW vii. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>THEREFORE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM; FOR THIS IS THE LAW, AND THE PROPHETS.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS precept of our divine Lord hath always been admired as mo&s;t excellent; and doubt|le&s;s with the greate&s;t rea&s;on. Yet it needs &s;ome explanation. It is not &s;urely to be under&s;tood in the mo&s;t unlimited &s;en&s;e, implying that becau&s;e a prince expects and wi&s;hes for obedience from his &s;ubjects, he is obliged to obey them; that becau&s;e parents wi&s;h their children to &s;ubmit to their go|vernment, therefore they are to &s;ubmit to the go|vernment of their children: or that becau&s;e &s;ome men wi&s;h that others would concur and a&s;&s;i&s;t them to the gratification of their unlawful de&s;ires, there|fore they al&s;o are to gratify the unlawful de&s;ires <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> others, But whatever we are con&s;cious, that we &s;hould, in an exchange of circum&s;tances, wi&s;h, and are per&s;uaded that we might rea&s;onably wi&s;h, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> others would do to us; that we are bound to do to them. This is the general rule given us in the
<PB N="4" REF="024292_0004_0FC616488CBDFE50">
text; and a very exten&s;ive rule it is, reaching to the whole of our conduct: and is particularly u&s;eful to direct our conduct toward inferiors, and tho&s;e whom we have in our power. I have therefore thought it a proper foundation for the di&s;cour&s;e which by <HI>The Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Per&s;ons unlawfully holden in Bondage,</HI> I have the honour to be appointed to de|liver, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This divine maxim is mo&s;t properly applicable to the &s;lave-trade, and to the &s;lavery of the Afri|cans. Let us then make the application.</P>
<P>Should we be willing, that the Africans or any other nation &s;hould purcha&s;e us, our wives and children, tran&s;port us into Africa, and there &s;ell us into perpetual and ab&s;olute &s;lavery? Should we be willing, that they by large bribes and offers of a gainful traffic &s;hould entice our neighbours to kid|nap and &s;ell us to them, and that they &s;hould hold in perpetual and cruel bondage, not only our&s;elves, but our po&s;terity through all generations? Yet why is it not as right for them to treat us in this man|ner, as it is for us to treat them in the &s;ame man|ner? Their colour indeed is different from our's. But does this give us a right to en&s;lave them? The nations, from Germany to Guinea, have com|plexions of every &s;hade, from the faire&s;t white to a jetty black: and if a black complexion &s;ubject a nation or an individual to &s;lavery; where &s;hall &s;la|very begin? or where &s;hall it end?</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to mention a few rea&s;ons again&s;t the right of the &s;lave-trade&mdash;and then to con&s;ider the principal arguments, which I have ever heard urg|ed in favour of it.&mdash;What will be &s;aid again&s;t the &s;lave-trade will generally be equally applicable to &s;lavery it&s;elf; and if conclu&s;ive again&s;t the former, will be equally conclu&s;ive again&s;t the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="024292_0005_0FC6164AA52D2E70">
As to the &s;lave-trade, I conceive it to be unju&s;t in it&s;elf&mdash;abominable, on account of the cruel man|ner in which it is conducted&mdash;and totally wrong, on account of the impolicy of it, or its de&s;tructive ten|dency to the moral and political intere&s;ts of any country.</P>
<P>I. It is unju&s;t in it&s;elf.&mdash;It is unju&s;t in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as it is to &s;teal, to rob, or to murder. It is a principle, the truth of which hath in this country been generally if not univer&s;ally acknowledged, ever &s;ince the commence|ment of the late war, <HI>that all men are born equally free.</HI> If this be true, the Africans are by nature equally entitled to freedom as we are; and therefore we have no more right to en&s;lave, or to afford aid to en&s;lave them, than they have to do the &s;ame to us. They have the &s;ame right to their freedom, which they have to their property, or to their lives. There|fore to en&s;lave them is as really and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e wrong, as to &s;teal from them, to rob, or to murder them.</P>
<P>There are indeed ca&s;es, in which men may ju&s;t|ly be deprived of their liberty, and reduced to &s;lavery; as there are ca&s;es, in which they may be ju&s;tly deprived of their lives. But they can ju&s;tly be deprived of neither, unle&s;s they have by their own voluntary conduct forfeited it. Therefore &s;till the right to liberty &s;tands on the &s;ame ba&s;is with the right to life. And that the Africans have done &s;omething, where by they have forfeited their liberty, mu&s;t appear, before we can ju&s;tly deprive them of it; as it mu&s;t appear, that they have done &s;ome|thing, whereby they have forfeited their lives, be|fore we may ju&s;tly deprive them of the&s;e.</P>
<P>II. The &s;lave-trade is wicked and abominable, on account of the cruel manner in which it is car|ried on.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024292_0006_0FC6164C2B360300">
Be&s;ide the &s;tealing or kidnapping of men, wo|men and children, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and the in|&s;tigation of others to this abominable practice; the inhuman manner in which they are tran&s;ported to America, and in which they are treated on their pa&s;&s;age and in their &s;ub&s;equent &s;lavery, is &s;uch as ought forever to deter every man from acting any part in this bu&s;ine&s;s, who has any regard to ju&s;tice or humanity. They are crowded &s;o clo&s;ely into the holds and between the decks of ve&s;&s;els, that they have &s;carcely room to lie down, and &s;ometimes not room to &s;it up in an erect po&s;ture; the men at the &s;ame time fa&s;tened together with irons by two and two; and all this in the mo&s;t &s;ultry climate. The con&s;equence of the whole is, that the mo&s;t dan|gerous and fatal di&s;ea&s;es are &s;oon bred among them, whereby va&s;t numbers of tho&s;e exported from Afri|ca peri&s;h in the voyage: others in dread of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;lavery which is before them, and in di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;pair, from the lo&s;s of their parents, their children, their hu&s;bands, their wives, all their dear connec|tions, and their dear native country it&s;elf, &s;tarve them&s;elves to death, or plunge them&s;elves into the ocean. Tho&s;e who attempt in the former of tho&s;e ways to e&s;cape from their per&s;ecutors, are tortured by live coals applied to their mouths. Tho&s;e who attempt an e&s;cape in the latter and fail, are equally tortured by the mo&s;t cruel beating, or otherwi&s;e as their per&s;ecutors plea&s;e. If any of them make an attempt, as they &s;ometimes do, to recover their li|berty, &s;ome, and as the circum&s;tances may be, ma|ny, are put to immediate death. Others beaten, brui&s;ed, cut and mangled, in a mo&s;t inhuman and &s;hocking manner, are in this &s;ituation exhibited to the re&s;t, to terrify them from the like attempt in future: and &s;ome are delivered up to every &s;pecies of torment, whether by the application of the whip,
<PB N="7" REF="024292_0007_0FC6164E5BCED1F8">
or of any other in&s;trument, even of fire it&s;elf, as the ingenuity of the &s;hip-ma&s;ter and of his crew is able to &s;ugge&s;t, or their &s;ituation will admit; and the&s;e torments are purpo&s;ely continued for &s;everal days, before death is permitted to afford relief to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e objects of vengeance.</P>
<P>By this means, according to the common com|putation, twenty-five thou&s;and, which is a fourth part of tho&s;e who are exported from Africa, and by the conce&s;&s;ion of all, twenty thou&s;and, annually per|i&s;h, before they arrive at the places of their de&s;ti|nation in America.</P>
<P>But this is by no means the end of the &s;ufferings of this unhappy people. Bred up in a country &s;pon|taneou&s;ly yielding the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of &s;avage life, they have never been accu&s;tomed to labour: of cour&s;e, they are but ill prepared to go through the fatigue and drudgery to which they are doomed in their &s;tate of &s;lavery. Therefore partly by this cau&s;e, partly by the &s;cantine&s;s and badne&s;s of their food, and partly from dejection of &s;pirits, mortification and de&s;pair, another twenty-five thou|&s;and die in the &s;ea&s;oning, as it is called, <HI>i. e.</HI> with|in two years of their arrival in America. This I &s;ay is the common computation. Or if we will in this particular be as favourable to the trade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the e&s;timate of the number which peri&s;hes on the pa&s;&s;age, we may reckon the number which dies in the &s;ea&s;oning to be twenty thou&s;and. So that of the hundred thou&s;and annually exported from Afri|ca to America, fifty thou&s;and, as it is commonly computed, or on the mo&s;t favourable e&s;timate, forty thou&s;and, die before they are &s;ea&s;oned to the coun|try.</P>
<P>Nor is this all. The cruel &s;ufferings of the&s;e pi|tiable beings are not yet at an end, Thence for|ward
<PB N="8" REF="024292_0008_0FC6165BCA472250">
they have to drag out a mi&s;erable life in ab&s;o|lute &s;lavery, entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of their ma&s;ters, by whom not only every venial fault, every mere inadvertence or mi&s;take, but even real virtues, are liable to be con&s;trued into the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, and puni&s;hed as &s;uch, according to their caprice or rage, while they are intoxicated &s;ometimes with liquor, &s;ometimes with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the&s;e ma&s;ters they are &s;upplied with barely enough to keep them from &s;tarving, as the whole expence laid out on a &s;lave for food, clothing and medicine, is commonly computed on an average at thirty &s;hillings &s;terling annually. At the &s;ame time they are kept at hard labour from five o'clock in the morning, till nine at night, excepting time to eat twice during the day. And they are con&s;tant|ly under the watchful eye of over&s;eers and Negro-drivers, more tyrannical and cruel than even their ma&s;ters them&s;elves. From the&s;e drivers, for every imagined as well as real neglect or want of exer|tion, they receive the la&s;h, the &s;mack of which is all day long in the ears of tho&s;e who are on the planta|tion or in the vicinity; and it is u&s;ed with &s;uch dex|terity and &s;everity, as not only to lacerate the &s;kin, but to tear out &s;mall portions of the fle&s;h at almo&s;t every &s;troke.</P>
<P>This is the general treatment of the &s;laves. But many individuals &s;uffer &s;till more &s;everely. Many, many are knocked down; &s;ome have their eyes beaten out; &s;ome have an arm or a leg broken, or chopt off; and many, for a very &s;mall or for no crime at all, have been beaten to death merely to gratify the fury of an enraged ma&s;ter or over&s;eer.</P>
<P>Nor ought we on this occa&s;ion to overlook the wars among the nations of Africa excited by the trade, or the de&s;truction attendant on tho&s;e wars. Not to mention the de&s;truction of property, the
<PB N="9" REF="024292_0009_0FC6165CEDDA9A08">
burning of towns and villages, &amp;c&punc; it hath been de|termined by rea&s;onable computation, that there are annually exported from Africa to the various parts of America, one hundred thou&s;and &s;laves, as was before ob&s;erved; that of the&s;e &s;ix thou&s;and are cap|tives of war; that in the wars in which the&s;e are taken, ten per&s;ons of the victors and vanqui&s;hed are killed, to one taken; that therefore the taking of the &s;ix thou&s;and captives is attended with the &s;laugh|ter of &s;ixty thou&s;and of their countrymen. Now does not ju&s;tice, does not humanity &s;hrink from the idea, that in order to procure one &s;lave to grati|fy our avarice, we &s;hould put to death ten human beings? Or that in order to increa&s;e our property, and that only in &s;ome &s;mall degree, we &s;hould carry on a trade, or even connive at it, to &s;upport which &s;ixty thou&s;and of our own &s;pecies are &s;lain in war?</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ixty thou&s;and, added to the forty thou|&s;and who peri&s;h on the pa&s;&s;age and in the &s;ea&s;on|ing, give us an hundred thou&s;and who are annually de&s;troyed by the trade; and the whole advantage gained by this amazing de&s;truction of human lives is &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;laves. For you will recollect, that the whole number exported from Africa in an hundred thou&s;and; that of the&s;e forty thou&s;and die on the pa&s;&s;age and in the &s;ea&s;oning, and &s;ixty thou|&s;and are de&s;troyed in the wars. Therefore while one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and are killed in the wars and are exported from Africa&punc; but &s;ixty thou|&s;and are added to the &s;tock of &s;laves.</P>
<P>Now when we con&s;ider all this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> when we con&s;i|der the mi&s;eries which this unhappy people &s;uffer in their wars, in their captivity, in their voyage to America, and during a wretched life of cruel &s;la|very&punc; and e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the annual de&s;truction of an hundred thou&s;and lives in the manner before mentioned; who can he&s;itate to de|clare
<PB N="10" REF="024292_0010_0FC6165E25AB14E8">
this trade and the con&s;equent &s;lavery to be contrary to every principle of ju&s;tice and humanity, of the law of nature and of the law of God?</P>
<P>III. This trade and this &s;lavery are utterly wrong on the ground of impolicy. In a variety of re&s;pects they are exceedingly hurtful to the &s;tate which to|lerates them.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are hurtful, as they deprave the morals of the people.&mdash;The ince&s;&s;ant and inhuman cruel|ties practi&s;ed in the trade, and in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;la|very, nece&s;&s;arily tend to harden the human heart again&s;t the tender feelings of humanity in the ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, in the &s;ailors, in the factors, in the propri|etors of the&s;e &s;laves, in their children, in the over&s;eers, in the &s;laves them&s;elves, and in all who habitually &s;ee tho&s;e cruelties. Now the eradication or even the di|minution of compa&s;&s;ion, tenderne&s;s and humanity, is certainly a great depravation of heart, and mu&s;t be followed with corre&s;pondent depravity of manners. And mea&s;ures which lead to &s;uch depravity of heart and manners, cannot but be extremely hurtful to the &s;tate, and con&s;equently are extremely impolitic.</P>
<P N="2">2. The trade is impolitic, as it is &s;o de&s;tructive of the lives of &s;eamen. The ingenious Mr. Clark|&s;on hath in a very &s;atisfactory manner made it ap|pear, that in the &s;lave-trade alone Great-Britain lo&s;es annually about nineteen hundred &s;eamen; and that this lo&s;s is more than double to the lo&s;s annual|ly &s;u&s;tained by Great-Britain in all her other trade taken together. And doubtle&s;s we lo&s;e as many as Great-Britain in proportion to the number of &s;ea|men whom we employ in this trade. Now can it be politic to carry on a trade which is &s;o de&s;tructive of that u&s;eful part of our citizens, our &s;eamen?</P>
<P N="3">3. African &s;lavery is exceedingly impolitic, as it di&s;courages indu&s;try. Nothing is more e&s;&s;ential to the political pro&s;perity of any &s;tate, than indu&s;try in
<PB N="11" REF="024292_0011_0FC6166125B60998">
the citizens. But in proportion as &s;laves are mul|tiplied, every kind of labour becomes ignominious: and in fact in tho&s;e of the United States, in which &s;laves are the mo&s;t numerous, gentlemen and ladies of any fa&s;hion di&s;dain to employ them&s;elves in bu|&s;ine&s;s, which in other &s;tates is con&s;i&s;ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the dignity of the fir&s;t families and fir&s;t offices. In a country filled with Negro &s;laves, labour belongs to them only, and a white man is de&s;pi&s;ed in propor|tion as he applies to it. Now how de&s;tructive to indu&s;try in all of the lowe&s;t and middle cla&s;s of ci|tizens, &s;uch a &s;ituation and the prevalence of &s;uch ideas will be, you can ea&s;ily conceive. The con|&s;equence is, that &s;ome will nearly &s;tarve, others will betake them&s;elves to the mo&s;t di&s;hone&s;t practices, to obtain the means of living.</P>
<P>As &s;lavery produces indolence in the white peo|ple, &s;o it produces all tho&s;e vices which are natu|rally connected with it; &s;uch as intemperance, lewdne&s;s and prodigality. The&s;e vices enfeeble both the body and the mind, and unfit men for any vigorous exertions and employments either ex|ternal or mental. And tho&s;e who are unfit for &s;uch exertions, are already a very degenerate race; de|generate, not only in a moral, but a natural &s;en&s;e. They are contemptible too, and will &s;oon be de|&s;pi&s;ed even by their Negroes them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Slavery tends to lewdne&s;s, not only as it produces indolence, but as it affords abundant opportunity for that wickedne&s;s, without either the danger and difficulty of an attack on the virtue of a woman of cha&s;tity, or the danger of a connection with one of ill fame. A planter with his hundred wenches about him is in &s;ome re&s;pects at lea&s;t like the Sul|tan in his &s;eraglio, and we learn the too frequent influence and effect of &s;uch a &s;ituation, not only from common fame, but from the multitude of
<PB N="12" REF="024292_0012_0FC6166684D1CB90">
mulattoes in countries where &s;laves are very nu|merous.</P>
<P>Slavery has a mo&s;t direct tendency to haughti|ne&s;s al&s;o, and a domineering &s;pirit and conduct in the proprietors of the &s;laves, in their children, and in all who have the controul of them. A man who has been bred up in domineering over Negroes, can &s;carcely avoid contracting &s;uch a habit of haughti|ne&s;s and domination, as will expre&s;s it&s;elf in his general treatment to mankind, whether in his pri|vate capacity, or in any office, civil or military, with which he may be ve&s;ted. De&s;poti&s;m in economics naturally leads to de&s;poti&s;m in politics, and dome&s;tic &s;lavery in a free government is a perfect &s;olici&s;m in human affairs.</P>
<P>How baneful all the&s;e tendencies and effects of &s;lavery mu&s;t be to the public good, and e&s;pecially to the public good of &s;uch a free country as our's, I need not inform you.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the &s;ame proportion as indu&s;try and labour are di&s;couraged, is population di&s;couraged and pre|vented. This is another re&s;pect in which &s;lavery is exceedingly impolitic. That population is pre|vented in proportion as indu&s;try is di&s;couraged, is, I conceive, &s;o plain, that nothing needs to be &s;aid to illu&s;trate it. Mankind in general will enter into matrimony as &s;oon as they po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of &s;upporting a family. But the great body of any people have no other way of &s;upporting them&s;elves or a family, than by their own labour. Of cour&s;e as labour is di&s;couraged, matrimony is di&s;|couraged, and population is prevented.&mdash;But the impolicy of whatever produces the&s;e effects will be acknowledged by all. The wealth, &s;trength and glory of a &s;tate depend on the number of its virtu|ous citizens: and a &s;tate without citizens is at lea&s;t as great an ab&s;urdity, as a king without &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="13" REF="024292_0013_0FC61667DC141470">
5. The impolicy of &s;lavery &s;till further appears from this, that it weakens the &s;tate, and in propor|tion to the degree in which it exi&s;ts, expo&s;es it to become an ea&s;y conque&s;t.&mdash;The increa&s;e of free ci|tizens is an increa&s;e of the &s;trength of the &s;tate. But not &s;o with regard to the increa&s;e of &s;laves. They not only add nothing to the &s;trength of the &s;tate, but actually dimini&s;h it in proportion to their num|ber. Every &s;lave is naturally an enemy to the &s;tate in which he is holden in &s;lavery, and wants nothing but an opportunity to a&s;&s;i&s;t in its overthrow. And an enemy within a &s;tate, is much more dangerous than one without it.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, concerning the prevention of population and weakening the &s;tate, are &s;upported by facts, which have fallen within our own ob&s;erva|tion. That the &s;outhern &s;tates, in which &s;laves are &s;o numerous, are in no mea&s;ure &s;o populous, ac|cording to the extent of territory, as the northern, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a fact of univer&s;al notoriety&punc; and that during the late war, the &s;outhern &s;tates found them&s;elves greatly weakened by their &s;laves, and therefore were &s;o ea&s;i|ly over-run by the Briti&s;h army, is equally noto|rious.</P>
<P>From the view we have now taken of this &s;ub|ject we &s;cruple not to infer, that to carry on the &s;lave-trade, and to introduce &s;laves into our coun|try, is not only to be guilty of inju&s;tice, robbery and cruelty, toward our follow-men; but it is to injure our&s;elves and our country; and therefore it is altogether unju&s;tifiable, wicked and abominable.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the inju&s;tice and ruinous tendency of the &s;lave-trade, I proceed to attend to the principal arguments urged in favour of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is &s;aid, that the Africans are the po&s;terity of Ham, the &s;on of Noah; that Canaan, one of Ham's &s;ons, was cur&s;ed by Noah&punc; to be a &s;ervant
<PB N="14" REF="024292_0014_0FC6166A50BBF750">
of &s;ervants; that by Canaan we are to under&s;tand Ham's po&s;terity in general; that as his po&s;terity are devoted by God to &s;lavery, we have a right to en&s;lave them.&mdash;This is the argument: to which I an&s;wer:</P>
<P>It is indeed generally thought that Ham peopled Africa; but that the cur&s;e on Canaan extended to all the po&s;terity of Ham is a mere imagination. The only rea&s;on given for it is, that Canaan was only one of Ham's &s;ons; and that it &s;eems rea&s;on|able, that the cur&s;e of Ham's conduct &s;hould fall on all his po&s;terity, if on any. But this argument is in&s;ufficient. We might as clearly argue, that the judgments denounced on the hou&s;e of David, on account of his &s;in in the matter of Uriah, mu&s;t equal|ly fall on all his po&s;terity. Yet we know, that many of them lived and died in great pro&s;perity. So in every ca&s;e in which judgments are predicted con|cerning any nation or family.</P>
<P>It is allowed in this argument, that the cur&s;e was to fall on the <HI>po&s;terity</HI> of Ham, and not immediate|ly on Ham him&s;elf: if otherwi&s;e, it is nothing to the purpo&s;e of the &s;lave-trade, or of any &s;laves now in exi&s;tence. It being allowed then, that this cur&s;e was to fall on Ham's po&s;terity, he who had a right to cur&s;e the whole of that po&s;terity, had the &s;ame right to cur&s;e a part of it only, and the po&s;terity of Canaan equally as any other part; and a cur&s;e on Ham's po&s;terity in the line of Canaan was as real a cur&s;e on Ham him&s;elf, as a cur&s;e on all his po&s;teri|ty would have been.</P>
<P>Therefore we have no ground to believe, that this cur&s;e re&s;pected any others, than the po&s;terity of Canaan, who lived in the land of Canaan, which is well known to be remote from Africa. We have a particular account, that all the &s;ons of Canaan &s;ettled in the land of Canaan; as may be &s;een in
<PB N="15" REF="024292_0015_0FC6166EC28C05F8">
Gen. x. 15&mdash;20. <Q>And Canaan begat Sidon his fir&s;t born, and Heth, and the Jebu&s;ite, and the Emorite, and the Girga&s;ite, and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and af|terward were the families of the Canaanites &s;pread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou goe&s;t to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goe&s;t unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Ad|mah, and Zeboim, even unto La&s;hah.</Q>&mdash;Nor have we account that any of their po&s;terity except the Carthaginians afterward removed to any part of Africa: and none will pretend that the&s;e peo|pled Africa in general; e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that they were &s;ubdued, de&s;troyed, and &s;o far extirpated by the Romans.</P>
<P>This cur&s;e then of the po&s;terity of Canaan, had no reference to the inhabitants of Guinea, or of Af|rica in general; but was fulfilled partly in Jo&s;hua's time, in the reduction and &s;ervitude of the Canaan|ites, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;pecially of the Gibeonites; partly by what the Phen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">s &s;uffered from the Chaldeans, Per&s;ians and Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s; and finally by what the Car|thaginians &s;uffered from the Romans.</P>
<P>Therefore this cur&s;e gives us no right to en&s;lave the Africans, as we do by the &s;lave-trade, becau&s;e it has no re&s;pect to the Africans whom we en&s;lave. Nor if it had re&s;pected them, would it have given any &s;uch right; becau&s;e it was not an in&s;titution of &s;lavery, but a mere prophecy of it. And from this prophecy we have no more ground to infer the right of &s;lavery, than we have from the prophecy of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem by Nebuchadnezzar, or by the Romans, to infer their right re&s;pectively to de|&s;troy it in the manner they did; or from other pro|phecies to infer the right of Judas to betray his ma&s;|ter, or the Jews to crucify him.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="024292_0016_0FC616715FD1B0E0">
2. The right of &s;lavery is inferred from the in|&s;tance of Abraham, who had &s;ervants born in his hou&s;e and bought with his money.&mdash;But it is by no means certain, that the&s;e were &s;laves as our Ne|groes are. If they were, it is unaccountable, that he went out at the head of an army of them to fight his enemies. No We&s;t-India planter would ea&s;ily be induced to venture him&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;ituation. It is far more probable, that &s;imilar to &s;ome of the va&s;&s;als under the feudal con&s;titution, the &s;ervants of Abraham were only in a good mea&s;ure dependent on him, and protected by him. But if they were to all intents and purpo&s;es &s;laves, Abraham's holding of them will no more prove the right of &s;lavery, than his going in to Hagar, will prove it right for any man to cohabit with his wench.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the divine permi&s;&s;ion given the I&s;raelites to buy &s;ervants of the nations round about them, it is argued, that we have a right to buy the Africans and hold them in &s;lavery. See Lev. xxv. 44&mdash;47. <Q>Both thy bondman and thy bondmaids, which thou &s;halt have, &s;hall be of the heathen that are round about you: of them &s;hall ye buy bond|men and bondmaids. Moreover, of the child|ren of the &s;trangers that do &s;ojourn among you, of them &s;hall ye buy, and of their families, that are with you, which they begat in your land; and they &s;hall be your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And ye &s;hall take them as an inheritance for your children af|ter you, to inherit them for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; they &s;hall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of I&s;rael ye &s;hall not rule one over another with rigour.</Q> But if this be at all to the purpo&s;e, it is a permi&s;&s;ion to every nation under heaven to buy &s;laves of the nations round about them; to us, to buy of our Indian neigh|bours; to them, to buy of us; so the French, to
<PB N="17" REF="024292_0017_0FC61673DC350DD8">
buy of the Engli&s;h, and to the Engli&s;h to buy of the French; and &s;o through the world. If then this argument be valid, every man has an entire right to engage in this trade, and to buy and &s;ell any other man of another nation, and any other man of another nation has an entire right to buy and &s;ell him. Thus, according to this con&s;truction, we have in Lev. xxv. 43, &amp;c. an in&s;titution of an univer&s;al &s;lave-trade, by which every man may not only become a merchant, but may rightfully be|come the merchandize it&s;elf of this trade, and may be bought and &s;old like a bea&s;t.&mdash;Now this con&s;e|quence will be given up as ab&s;urd, and therefore al&s;o the con&s;truction of &s;cripture, from which it fol|lows, mu&s;t be given up. Yet it is pre&s;umed, that there is no avoiding that con&s;truction or the ab&s;urd|ity flowing from it, but by admitting, that this per|mi&s;&s;ion to the I&s;raelites to buy &s;laves has no re&s;pect to us, but was in the &s;ame manner peculiar to them, as the permi&s;&s;ion, and command to &s;ubdue, de&s;troy and extirpate the whole Canaaniti&s;h nation; and therefore no more gives countenance to African &s;lavery, than the command to extirpate the Canaan|ites, gives countenance to the extirpation of any nation in the&s;e days, by an univer&s;al &s;laughter of men and women, young men and maidens, infants and &s;ucklings.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is further pleaded, that there were &s;laves in the time of the apo&s;tles; that they did not forbid the holding of tho&s;e &s;laves, but gave directions to &s;ervants, doubtle&s;s referring to the &s;ervants of that day, to obey <HI>their ma&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>count them worthy of all honour.</HI></P>
<P>To this the an&s;wer is, that the apo&s;tles teach the general duty of &s;ervants who are righteou&s;ly in the &s;tate of &s;ervitude, as many are or may be, by hire, by indenture, and by judgment of a civil court.
<PB N="18" REF="024292_0018_0FC6167564A6EF40">
But they do not &s;ay, whether the &s;ervants in general of that day were ju&s;tly holden in &s;lavery or not. In like manner they lay down the general rules of obedience to civil magi&s;trates, without deciding concerning the characters of the magi&s;trates of the Roman empire in the reign of Nero. And as the apo&s;tle Paul requires ma&s;ters <HI>to give their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that which is ju&s;t and equal</HI> (Col. iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) &s;o if any were en&s;laved unju&s;tly, of cour&s;e be in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re|quires of the ma&s;ters of &s;uch, to give them their freedom.&mdash;Thus the apo&s;tles great the &s;lavery of that day in the &s;ame manner that they treat the civil government; and &s;ay nothing more in favour of the former, than they &s;ay in favour of the latter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this argument from the &s;lavery&punc; prevail|ing in the days of the apo&s;tles, if it prove any thing, proves too much, and &s;o confutes it&s;elf. It proves, that we may en&s;lave all captives taken in war, of any nation, and in any the mo&s;t unju&s;t war, &s;uch as the wars of the Romans, which were generally un|dertaken from the motives of ambition or avarice. On the ground of this argument we had a right to en&s;lave the pri&s;oners, whom we, during the late war, took from the Briti&s;h army; and they had the &s;ame right to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e whom they took from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and &s;o with re&s;pect to all other nations.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is &s;trongly urged, that the Negroes brought from Africa are all captives of war, and therefore are ju&s;tly bought and holden in &s;lavery.&mdash;This is a principal argument always urged by the advocates for &s;lavery; and in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> debate on this &s;ubject, it hath been &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on very lately, in the Briti&s;h parliament. Therefore it requires our par|ticular attention.</P>
<P>Captives in a war ju&s;t on their part, cannot be ju&s;tly en&s;laved; nor is this pretended. Therefore the captives, who may be ju&s;tly en&s;laved, mu&s;t be
<PB N="19" REF="024292_0019_0FC61676DF1A4F90">
taken in a war unju&s;t on their part. But even on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that captives in &s;uch a war may be ju&s;tly en&s;laved, it will not follow, that we can ju&s;t|ly carry on the &s;lave-trade, as it is commonly car|ried on from the African coa&s;t. In this trade any &s;laves are purcha&s;ed, who are offered for &s;ale, whe|ther ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly en&s;laved. No enquiry is made whether they were captives in any war; much le&s;s, whether they were captivated in a war unju&s;t on their part.</P>
<P>By the mo&s;t authentic accounts, it appears, that the wars in general in Africa are excited by the pro&s;pect of gain from the &s;ale of the captives of the war. Therefore tho&s;e taken by the a&s;&s;ailants in &s;uch wars, cannot be ju&s;tly en&s;laved. Be&s;ide the&s;e, many are kidnapped by tho&s;e of neighbouring na|tions&punc; &s;ome by their own neighbours; and &s;ome by their kings or their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> others for debt or &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ling crime are condemned to perpetual &s;lavery.&mdash;But none of the&s;e are ju&s;tly en&s;laved. And the traders make no enquiry concerning the mode or occa&s;ion of their fir&s;t en&s;lavement. They buy all that are offered, provided they like them and the price.&mdash;So that the plea, that the African &s;laves are captives in war, is entirely in&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the &s;lave-trade as now carried on.</P>
<P>But this is not all&punc; if it were ever &s;o true, that all the Negroes exported from Africa were captives in war, and that they were taken in a war unju&s;t on their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t&punc; &s;till they could not be ju&s;tly en&s;laved.&mdash;We have no right to en&s;lave a private for in a &s;tate of nature, after he is conquered. Suppo&s;e in a &s;tate of nature one man ri&s;es again&s;t another, and endeavours to kill him; in this ca&s;e the per&s;ons a&s;|&s;aulted has no right to kill the a&s;&s;ailant, unle&s;s it be nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve his own life. But in wars be|tween nations, one nation may no doubt &s;ecure it|&s;elf
<PB N="20" REF="024292_0020_0FC6167AE31BB390">
again&s;t another, by other means than the &s;lave|ry of its captives. If a nation be victorious in the war, it may exact &s;ome towns or a di&s;trict of coun|try, by way of caution; or it may impo&s;e a fine to deter from future injuries. If the nation be no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> victorious, it will do no good to en&s;lave the captives whom it has taken. It will provoke the victors and fooli&s;hly excite vengeance which cannot be re|pelled.</P>
<P>Or if neither nation be decidedly victorious, to en&s;lave the captives on either &s;ide can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e, but mu&s;t at lea&s;t occa&s;ion the en&s;lav|ing of the citizens of the other nation, who are now or in future may be in a &s;tate of captivity. Such a practice therefore nece&s;&s;arily tends to evil, and not good.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; captives in war are generally common &s;oldiers or common citizens; and they are general|ly ignorant of the true cau&s;e or cau&s;es of the war, and are by their &s;uperiors made to believe, that the war is entirely ju&s;t on their part. Or if this be not the ca&s;e, they may by force be compelled to &s;erve in a war which they know to be unju&s;t. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, they do not de&s;erve to be con|demned to perpetual &s;lavery. To inflict perpetual &s;lavery on the&s;e private &s;oldiers and citizens is man|ife&s;tly not to do as we would wi&s;h that men &s;hould do to us. If we were taken in a war unju&s;t on our part, we &s;hould not think it right to be condemned to perpetual &s;lavery. No more right is it for us to condemn and hold in perpetual &s;lavery others, who are in the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is argued, that as the Africans in their own country, previou&s;ly to the purcha&s;e of them by the African traders, are captives in war; if they were not bought up by tho&s;e traders, they would be put to death&punc; that therefore to purcha&s;e them, and to
<PB N="21" REF="024292_0021_0FC6167CE002C748">
&s;ubject them to &s;lavery in&s;tead of death, is an act of mercy, not only lawful but meritorious.</P>
<P>If the ca&s;e were indeed &s;o as is now repre|&s;ented, the purcha&s;e of the Negroes would be no more meritorious, than the act of a man, who if we were taken by the Algerines, &s;hould purcha&s;e us out of that &s;lavery. This would indeed be an act of benevolence, if the purcha&s;er &s;hould &s;et us at li|berty. But it is no act of benevolence to buy a man out of one &s;tate into another no better. Nay, the act of ran&s;oming a man from death, gives no right to the ran&s;ome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to commit a crime or an act of inju&s;tice to the per&s;on ran&s;omed. The per&s;on ran&s;omed is doubtle&s;s obligated according to his ability to &s;atisfy the ran&s;omer for his expence and trouble. Yet the ran&s;omer has no more right to en&s;lave the other, than the man who &s;aves the life of another, who was about to be killed by a robber or an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, has a right to en&s;lave him&punc;&mdash;The li|berty of a man for life is a far greater good, than the property paid for a Negro on the African coa&s;t. And to deprive a man of an immen&s;ely greater good, in order to recover one immen&s;ely le&s;s, is an immen&s;e injury and crime.</P>
<P N="7">7. As to the pretence, that to prohibit or lay a&s;ide this trade, would be hurtful to our commerce; it is &s;ufficient to a&s;k; whether on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it were advantageous to the commerce of Great-Britain to &s;end her &s;hips to the&s;e &s;tates, and tran&s;|port us into perpetual &s;lavery in the We&s;t-Indies, it would be right that &s;he &s;hould go into that trade.</P>
<P N="8">8. That to prohibit the &s;lave-trade would in|fringe on the property of tho&s;e, who have expended large &s;ums to curry on that trade, or of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to purcha&s;e the &s;laves for their plantations&punc; hath al&s;o been urged as an argument in-favour of the trade&punc;&mdash;But the &s;ame argument would prove, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="22" REF="024292_0022_0FC616810355F548">
that if the &s;kins and teeth of the Negroes were as valuable articles of commerce as furs and elephants' teeth, and a merchant were to lay out his property in this commerce, he ought by no means to be ob|&s;tructed therein.</P>
<P N="9">9. But others will carry on the trade, if we do not.&mdash;So others will rob, &s;teal and murder, if we do not.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is &s;aid, that &s;ome men are intended by na|ture to be &s;laves.&mdash;If this mean, that the author of nature has given &s;ome men a licence to en&s;lave others; this is denied, and proof is demanded. If it mean, that God hath made &s;ome of capacities in|ferior to others, and that the la&s;t have a right to en|&s;lave the fir&s;t&punc; this argument will prove, that &s;ome of the citizens of every country, have a right to en|&s;lave other citizens of the &s;ame country; nay, that &s;ome have a right to en&s;lave their own brothers and &s;i&s;ters.&mdash;But if this argument mean, that God in his providence &s;uffers &s;ome men to be en&s;laved, and that this proves, that from the beginning he intend|ed they &s;hould be en&s;laved, and made them with this intention; the an&s;wer is, that in like manner he &s;uffers &s;ome men to be murdered, and in this &s;en&s;e&punc; he intended and made them to be murdered. Yet no man in his &s;en&s;es will hence argue the law|fulne&s;s of murder.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is further pretended, that no other men, than Negroes&punc; can endure labour in the hot cli|mates of the We&s;t-Indies, and the &s;outhern &s;tates&punc;&mdash;But does this appear to be fact? In all other cli|mates, the labouring people are the mo&s;t healthy. And I confe&s;s I have not yet &s;een evidence, but that tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to labour, and are inured to tho&s;e climates, can bear labour there al&s;o.&mdash;However, taking for granted the fact a&s;&s;erted in this objection, does it follow, that the
<PB N="23" REF="024292_0023_0FC616821F9A35C0">
inhabitants of tho&s;e countries have a right to en&s;lave the Africans to labour for them? No more &s;urely than from the circum&s;tance, that you are feeble and cannot labour, it follows, that you have a right to en&s;lave your robu&s;t neighbour. As in all other ca&s;es, he feeble and tho&s;e who choo&s;e not to labour, and ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with to have their lands cultivated, are ne|ce&s;&s;itated to hire the robu&s;t to labour for them; &s;o no rea&s;on can be given, why the inhabitants of not climates &s;hould not either perform their own labour, of hire tho&s;e who can perform it, whether Negroes or others.</P>
<P>If our traders went to the coa&s;t of Africa to mur|der the inhabitants, or to rob them of their proper|ty, all would own that &s;uch murderous or practical practices are wicked and abominable. Now it is as really wicked to rob a man of his liberty, as to rob him of his life; and it is much more wicked, than to rob him of his property. All men agree to con|demn highway robbery. And the &s;lave-trade is as much a greater wickedne&s;s than highway robbery, as liberty is more valuable than property. How &s;trange is it then, that in the &s;ame nation highway robbery &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death, and the &s;lave-trade be encouraged by national authority?</P>
<P>We all dread political &s;lavery, or &s;ubjection to the arbitrary power of a king, or of any man or men not deriving their authority from the people. Yet &s;uch a &s;tate is inconceivably preferable to the &s;lave|ry of the Negroes. Suppo&s;e that in the late war we had been &s;ubdued by Great-Britain; we &s;hould have been taxed without our con&s;ent. But the&s;e taxes would have amounted to but a &s;mall part of our property. Whereas the Negroes are deprived of all their property; no part of their earnings is their own; the whole is their ma&s;ters.&mdash;In a conquered &s;tate we &s;hould have been at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of our|&s;elves
<PB N="24" REF="024292_0024_0FC6168483351738">
and of our property, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, as we &s;hould choo&s;e. We &s;hould have been free to live in this or that town or place; in any part of the country, or to remove out of the country; to apply to this or that bu&s;ine&s;s; to labour or not; and excepting a &s;ufficiency for the taxes, to di&s;po&s;e of the fruit of our labour to our own benefit, or that of our child|ren, or of any other per&s;on. But the unhappy. Ne|groes in &s;lavery can do none of the&s;e, things. They mu&s;t do what they are commanded, and as much as they are commanded, on pain of the la&s;h. They mu&s;t live where they are placed, and mu&s;t confine them&s;elves to that &s;pot&punc; on pain of death.</P>
<P>So that Great-Britain in her late attempt to en|&s;lave America, committed a very &s;mall crime in|deed, in compari&s;on with the crime of tho&s;e who en|&s;lave the Africans.</P>
<P>The arguments which have been urged again&s;t the &s;lave-trade, are with little variation applicable&punc; to the holding of &s;laves. He who holds a &s;lave, continues to deprive him of that liberty, which was taken from him on the coa&s;t of Africa. And if it were wrong to deprive him of it in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, why not in the &s;econd? If this be true, no man hath a better, right to retain his Negro in &s;lavery, than he had to take him from his native African &s;hores. And every man who cannot &s;how, that his Negro hath by his voluntary conduct forfeit|ed his liberty, is obligated immediately to ma|numit him. Undoubtedly we &s;hould think &s;o, were we holden in the &s;ame &s;lavery in which the Negroes are: and our text requires us to do to others, as we would that they &s;hould do to us.</P>
<P>To hold a &s;lave, who has a right to his liberty, is not only a real crime, but a very great one. Ma|ny good Chri&s;tians have wondered how Abra|ham, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he father of the faithful, could take Hagar to
<PB N="25" REF="024292_0025_0FC61686E6E3BBF8">
his bed; and how Sarah, celebrated as an holy woman, could con&s;ent to this tran&s;action: al&s;o, how David and Solomon could have &s;o many wives and concubines, and yet be real &s;aints. Let &s;uch enquire how it is po&s;&s;ible that our fathers, and men now alive, univer&s;ally reputed pious, &s;hould hold Negro &s;laves, and yet be the &s;ubjects of real piety? And whether to reduce a man, who hath the &s;ame right to liberty as any other man, to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;lavery, or to hold him in that &s;tate, be not as great a crime as concubinage or fornication. I pre&s;ume it will not be denied, that to commit theft or robbery every day of a man's life, is as great a &s;in as to commit fornication in one in&s;tance. But to &s;teal a man, or to rob him of his liberty, is a greater &s;in than to &s;teal his property, or to take it by violence. And to hold a man in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, who has a right to his liberty, is to be every day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or of man-&s;tealing. The con&s;equence is inevitable, that other things being the &s;ame, to hold a Negro &s;lave, un|le&s;s he have forfeited his liberty, is a greater &s;in in the &s;ight of God than concubinage or fornication.</P>
<P>Does this conclu&s;ion &s;eem &s;trange to any of you? Let me entreat you to weigh it candidly, before you reject it. You will not deny, that liberty is more valuable than property: and that it is a greater &s;in to deprive a man of his whole liberty during life, than to deprive him of his whole property; or that man-&s;tealing is a greater crime than robbery. Nor will you deny, that to hold in &s;lavery a man who was &s;tolen, is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame crime as to &s;teal him. The&s;e principles being undeniable, I leave it to your&s;elves to draw the plain and nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence. And if your con&s;ciences &s;hall, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition, tell you, that while you hold your Negroes in &s;lavery, you do wrong, exceedingly
<PB N="26" REF="024292_0026_0FC616882D8D9348">
wrong; that you do not, as you would that men &s;hould do to you; that you commit &s;in in the &s;ight of God; that you daily violate the plain rights of mankind, and that in a higher degree, than if you committed the&s;e or robbery; let me be&s;eech you not to &s;tifle this conviction, but attend to it and act accordingly; le&s;t you add to your former guilt, that of &s;inning again&s;t the light of truth, and of your own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>To convince your&s;elves, that, your information being the &s;ame, to hold a Negro &s;lave is a greater &s;in than fornication, theft or robbery, you need on|ly bring the matter home to your&s;elves. I am wil|ling to appeal to your own con&s;ciences, whether you would not judge it to be a greater &s;in for a man to hold you or your child during life in &s;uch &s;lavery as&punc; that of the Negroes, than for him to &s;pend one night in a brother, or in one in&s;tance to &s;teal or rob. Let con&s;cience &s;peak, and I will &s;ub|mit to its deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion &s;eems to be clearly decided by re|velation. Exod. xxi. 16. <Q>He that &s;tealeth a man and &s;elleth him or if he be found in his hand&punc; he &s;hall &s;urely be put to death.</Q> Thus death is, by the divine expre&s;s declaration, the puni&s;hment due to the crime of man-&s;tealing. But death is not the puni&s;hment declared by God to be due to for|nication, theft or robbery, in common ca&s;es. There|fore we have the divine authority to a&s;&s;ert, that man-&s;tealing is a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery. Now to hold in &s;lavery a man who has a right to liberty, is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame crime as to deprive him of his liberty. And to deprive of li|berty, and reduce to &s;lavery, a man who has a right to liberty, is man-&s;tealing For it is immaterial, whether he be taken and reduced to &s;lavery clan|de&s;tinely, or by open violence. Therefore if the
<PB N="27" REF="024292_0027_0FC6168CA059E7F8">
Negroes have a right to liberty; to hold them in &s;lavery is manumitting, which we have &s;een is, by God him&s;elf, declared to be a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery.</P>
<P>Perhaps, though this truth be clearly demon|&s;trable, both from rea&s;on and revelation, you &s;carce|ly dare receive it, becau&s;e it &s;eems to bear hardly on the characters of our pious fathers, who held &s;laves But they did it ignorantly, and in unbelief of the truth; as Abraham; Jacob, David and So|lomon, were ignorant that polygamy or concubin|age was wrong. As to dome&s;tic &s;lavery, our fathers lived in a <HI>time of ignorance, which God winked at but now be commandeth all men every where to re|pent</HI> of this wickedne&s;s, and <HI>to break off this &s;in by righteou&s;ne&s;s, and this iniquity by &s;hewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening out of their tranquil|ity.</HI> You therefore to whom the pre&s;ent blaze of light as to this &s;ubject has reached, cannot &s;in at &s;o cheap a rate as our fathers.</P>
<P>But methinks I hear &s;ome &s;ay, I have bought my Negro. I have paid a large &s;um for him; I cannot lo&s;e this &s;um, and therefore I cannot manumit him.&mdash;Alas! this is <HI>bitting the nail on the head.</HI> This brings into view the true cau&s;e which makes it &s;o difficult to convince men of what is right in this ca&s;e.&mdash;You recollect the &s;tory of Amaziah's hiring an hundred thou&s;and men of I&s;rael; for an hun|dred talents, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the Edomites&punc; and that when by the word of the Lord, he was forbidden to take tho&s;e hired men with him to the war, he cried out, <Q>But what &s;hall we do for the hundred talents, which I have given to the army of I&s;rael?</Q> In this ca&s;e, the an&s;wer of God was <Q>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</Q>&mdash;To apply this to the &s;ubject before us&punc; God is able to give thee much more than thou &s;halt lo&s;e by man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ritting thy &s;lave.</P>

You may plead, that you u&s;e your &s;la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; well; you are not cruel to him, but feed and clothe him comfortably, &amp;c. Still every day you rob him of a mo&s;t valuable and important right. And a high|wayman, who robs a man of his money in the mo&s;t ea&s;y and complai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ant manner, is &s;till a robber; and murder may be effected in a manner the lea&s;t cruel and tormenting; &s;till it is murder.</P>
<P>Having now taken that view of our &s;ubject which was propo&s;ed, we may in reflection &s;ee abundant rea&s;on to acquie&s;ce in the in&s;titution of this &s;ociety. If the &s;lave-trade be unju&s;t, and as gro&s;s a violation of the rights of mankind, as would be, if the Afri|cans &s;hould tran&s;port us into perpetual &s;lavery in Africa; to unite our influence again&s;t it, is a duty which we owe to mankind, to our&s;elves, and to God too. It is but doing as we would that men &s;hould do to us.&mdash;Nor is it enough that we have formed the &s;ociety; we mu&s;t do the duties of it. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is to put an end to the &s;lave-trade. The &s;econd is to relieve tho&s;e who, contrary to the laws of the country, are holden in bondage. Another is to defend tho&s;e in their remaining legal and natural rights, who are by law holden in bondage. Ano|ther, and not the lea&s;t important object of this &s;o|ciety, I conceive to be, to increa&s;e and di&s;per&s;e the light of truth with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of African &s;lavery, and &s;o prepare the way for its total aboli|tion. For until men in general are convinced of the inju&s;tice of the trade, and of the &s;lavery it&s;elf, comparatively little can be done to effect the mo&s;t important purpo&s;es of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, that the trade is even now carried on from this &s;tate. Ve&s;&s;els are from time to time fitted out for the coa&s;t of Africa, to tran&s;port the Negroes to the We&s;t-Indies and other parts. Nor will an end be put to this trade, with|out
<PB N="29" REF="024292_0029_0FC61694CC7164F0">
out vigilance and &s;trenuous exertion on the part of this &s;ociety; or other friends of humanity; nor with|out a patient enduring of the oppo&s;ition and odium of all who are concerned in it, of their friends, and of all who are of the opinion that it is ju&s;tifiable. Among the&s;e we are doubtle&s;s to reckon &s;ome of large property, and con&s;iderable influence. And if the laws and cu&s;toms of the country equally allow|ed of it, many, and perhaps as many as now plead for the right of the African &s;lave-trade, would plead for the right of kidnapping us, the citizens of the United States, and of &s;elling us into perpetual &s;lave|ry.&mdash;If then we dare not occur the di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;uch men, we may as well di&s;&s;olve the &s;ociety, and leave the &s;lave-trade to be carried on, and the Ne|groes to be kidnapped; and though free in this &s;tate, to be &s;old into perpetual &s;lavery in di&s;tant parts, at the plea&s;ure of any man, who wi&s;hes to make gain by &s;uch abominable practices.</P>
<P>Though we mu&s;t expect oppo&s;ition, yet if we be &s;teady and per&s;evering, we need not fear that we &s;hall fail of &s;ucce&s;s. The advantages, which the cau&s;e has already gained, are many and great. Thirty years ago &s;carcely a man in this country thought either the &s;lave-trade or the &s;lavery of Ne|groes to be wrong. But now how many and able advocates in private life, in our legi&s;latures&punc; in Con|gre&s;s, have appeared, and have openly and irrefra|gably pleaded the rights of humanity in this as well as other in&s;tances? Nay, the great body of the peo|ple, from New-Hamp&s;hire to Virginia inclu&s;ively, have obtained &s;uch light, that in all tho&s;e &s;tates the further importation of &s;laves is prohibited by law. And in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, &s;lave|ry is totally aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Nor is the light concerning this &s;ubject confined to America. It hath appeared with great clearne&s;s
<PB N="30" REF="024292_0030_0FC61695ECEB67A8">

This light is &s;till increa&s;ing&punc; and in time will effect a total revolution.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SOME objections to the doctrine of the preced|ing &s;ermon have been mentioned to the author, &s;ince the delivery of it. Of the&s;e it may be proper to take &s;ome notice.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;laves are in a better &s;ituation than that in which they were in their own country; e&s;pecial|ly as they have opportunity to know the Chri&s;tian religion, and to &s;ecure the &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings of it. Therefore it is not an injury, but a benefit, to bring them into this country, even though their importa|tion be accompanied and followed with &s;lavery. It is al&s;o &s;aid, that the &s;ituation of many Negroes un|der their ma&s;ters is much better than it would be were they free in this country; that they are much better fed and clothed, and are much more happy; that therefore to hold them in &s;lavery is &s;o far from a crime, that it is a meritorious act.</P>
<P>With regard to the&s;e pleas, it is to be ob&s;erved, that every man hath a right to judge concerning his own happine&s;s, and to choo&s;e the means of ob|taining or promoting it; and to deprive him of this right is the very injury of which we complain; it is to en&s;lave him. Becau&s;e we judge, that the Ne|groes are more happy in this country, in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, than in the enjoyment of liberty in Africa, we have no more right to en&s;lave them and bring them into this country, than we have to en&s;lave any of our neighbours, who we judge would be more happy under our controul, than they are at pre&s;ent under their own. Let us make the ca&s;e our own. Should we believe that we were ju&s;tly treated, if the Africans &s;hould carry us into perpetual &s;lavery
<PB N="32" REF="024292_0032_0FC6169EB3D7AEC8">
in Africa, on the ground that they judged that we &s;hould be more happy in that &s;tate, than in our pre|&s;ent &s;ituation?</P>
<P>As to the opportunity which the Negroes in this country are &s;aid to have, to become acquainted with Chri&s;tianity; this with re&s;pect to many is granted: but what follows from it? It would be ridiculous to pretend that this is the motive on which they act who import them, or they who buy and hold them in &s;lavery. Or if this were the motive, it would not &s;anctify either the trade or the &s;lavery. We are not at liberty to do evil, that good may come; to commit a crime more aggravated than theft or robbery, that we may make a pro&s;elyte to Chri&s;tianity. Neither our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor any one of his apo&s;tles, has taught us this mode of propagating the faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is &s;aid, that the doctrine of the preceding &s;ermon imputes that as a crime to individuals, which is owing to the &s;tate of &s;ociety. This is granted; and what follows? It is owing to the &s;tate of &s;oci|ety, that our neighbours the Indians roa&s;t their captives: and does it hence follow, that &s;uch con|duct is not to be imputed to the individual agents as a crime? It is owing to the &s;tate of &s;ociety in Popi&s;h countries, that thou&s;ands wor&s;hip the bea&s;t and his image: and is that wor&s;hip therefore not to be imputed as a crime to tho&s;e who render it? Read the Revelation of St. John. The &s;tate of &s;o|ciety is &s;uch, that drunkenne&s;s and adultery are ve|ry common in &s;ome countries; but will it follow, that tho&s;e vices are innocent in tho&s;e countries?</P>
<P N="3">3. If I be ever &s;o willing to manumit my &s;lave, I cannot do it without being holden to maintain him, when he &s;hall be &s;ick, or &s;hall be old and de|crepit. Therefore I have a right to hold him as a &s;lave.&mdash;The &s;ame argument will prove, that you
<PB N="33" REF="024292_0033_0FC616A0DE9C8858">
have a right to en&s;lave your children or your pa|rents; as you are equally holden to maintain them in &s;ickne&s;s and in decrepit old age.&mdash;The argument implies, that in order to &s;ecure the money, which you are afraid the laws of your country will &s;ome time or other oblige you to pay; it is right for you to rob a free man of his liberty, or be guilty of man-&s;tealing. On the ground of this argument, every town or pari&s;h obligated by law to maintain its helple&s;s poor, has a right to &s;ell into perpetual &s;lave|ry all the people who may probably or even po&s;&s;i|bly occa&s;ion a public expence.</P>
<P N="4">4. After all, it is not &s;afe to manumit the Ne|groes: they would cut our throats; they would en|danger the peace and government of the &s;tate. Or at lea&s;t they would be &s;o idle, that they would not provide them&s;elves with nece&s;&s;aries; of cour&s;e, they mu&s;t live by thievery and plundering.</P>
<P>This objection requires a different an&s;wer, as it re&s;pects the northern, and as it re&s;pects the &s;outh|ern &s;tates. As it re&s;pects the northern, in which &s;laves are &s;o few, there is not the lea&s;t foundation to imagine, that they would combine or make in|&s;urrection again&s;t the government; or that they would attempt to murder their ma&s;ters. They are much more likely to kill their ma&s;ters, in order to obtain their liberty, or to revenge the abu&s;e they receive, while it is &s;till continued, than to do it af|ter the abu&s;e hath cea&s;ed, and they are re&s;tored to their liberty. In this ca&s;e, they would from a &s;en&s;e of gratitude, or at lea&s;t from a conviction of the ju&s;tice of their ma&s;ters, feel a &s;trong attachment, in&s;tead of a murderous di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Nor is there the lea&s;t danger, but that by a pro|per vigilance of the &s;elect-men, and by a &s;trict exe|cution of the laws now exi&s;ting, the Negroes might in a tolerable degree be kept from idlene&s;s and pil|fering.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="024292_0034_0FC616A25EA5CF58">
All this hath been verified by experiment. In Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, all the Negroes in the common|wealth were by their new con&s;titution liberated in a day: and none of the ill con&s;equences objected fol|lowed either to the commonwealth or to individuals.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;outhern &s;tates, the ca&s;e is different. The Negroes in &s;ome parts of tho&s;e &s;tates are a great majority of the whole, and there|fore the evils objected would, in ca&s;e of a general manumi&s;&s;ion at once, be more likely to take place. But in the fir&s;t place there is no pro&s;pect that the Conviction of the truth, exhibited in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, will at once take place in the minds of all the holders of &s;laves. The utmo&s;t that can be expected, is that it will take place gradually in one after another, and that of cour&s;e the &s;laves will be gradually manumitted. Therefore the evils of a general manumi&s;&s;ion at once, are dreaded without rea&s;on.</P>
<P>If in any &s;tate the &s;laves &s;hould be manumitted in con&s;iderable numbers at once, or &s;o that the num|ber of free Negroes &s;hould become large; various mea&s;ures might be concerted to prevent the evils feared. One I beg leave to propo&s;e: that over|&s;eers of the free Negroes be appointed from among them&s;elves, who &s;hall be empowered to in&s;pect the morals and management of the re&s;t, and report to proper authority tho&s;e who are vicious, idle or in|capable of managing their own affairs; and that &s;uch authority di&s;po&s;e of them under proper ma&s;ters for a year or other term, as is done perhaps in all the &s;tates, with regard to the poor white people in like manner vicious, idle, or incapable of management. Such black over&s;eers would naturally be ambitious to di&s;charge the duties of their office; they would in many re&s;pects have much more influence than white men with their countrymen: and other Ne|groes
<PB N="35" REF="024292_0035_0FC616A4EB3CDCE8">
looking forward to the &s;ame honourable di&s;|tinction, would endeavour to de&s;erve it by their improvement and good conduct.</P>
<P>But, after all, this whole objection, if it were ever &s;o entirely founded on truth&mdash;if the freed Negroes would probably ri&s;e again&s;t their ma&s;ters, or com|bine again&s;t government, re&s;ts on the &s;ame ground as the apology of the robber, who murders the man whom he has robbed. Says the robber to him&s;elf, I have robbed this man, and now if I let him go he will kill me, or he will complain to authority, and I &s;hall be apprehended and hung. I mu&s;t therefore kill him. There is no other way of &s;afety for me.&mdash;The coincidence between this rea&s;oning and that of the objection under con&s;ideration, mu&s;t be mani|fe&s;t to all. And if this rea&s;oning of the robber be inconclu&s;ive; if the robber have no right on that ground to kill the man whom he hath robbed; neither have the &s;lave-holders any more right to continue to hold their &s;laves. If the robber ought to &s;pare the life of the man robbed, take his own chance, and e&s;teem him&s;elf happy, if he can e&s;cape ju&s;tice; &s;o the &s;lave-holders ought immediately to let their &s;laves go free, treat them with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s, by &s;uch treatment endeavour to pacify them with re&s;pect to pa&s;t injuries, and e&s;teem them|&s;elves happy, if they can compromi&s;e the matter in this manner.</P>
<P>In all countries, in which the &s;laves are a majority of the inhabitants, the ma&s;ters lie in a great mea&s;ure at the mercy of the &s;laves, and may mo&s;t rationally expect &s;ooner or later to be cut off, or driven out by the &s;laves, or to be reduced to the &s;ame level, and to be mingled with them into one common ma&s;s. This I think is, by ancient and modern events, demon&s;trated to be the natural and nece&s;&s;ary cour&s;e of human affairs. The hewers of wood and
<PB N="36" REF="024292_0036_0FC616A8FAA98848">
drawers of water among the I&s;raelites, the Helots among the Lacedemonians, the &s;laves among the Romans, the villains and va&s;&s;als in mo&s;t of the king|doms of Europe under the feudal &s;y&s;tem, have long &s;ince mixed with the common ma&s;s of the people, and &s;hared the common privileges and honours of their re&s;pective countries. And in the French We&s;t-Indies the Mulattoes and free Negroes are already become &s;o numerous and powerful a body, as to be allowed by the National A&s;&s;embly to enjoy the common rights and honours of free men. The&s;e facts plainly &s;how, what the whites in the We&s;t-Indies and the &s;outhern &s;tates are to expect con|cerning their po&s;terity, that it will infallibly be a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngrel breed, or el&s;e they mu&s;t quit the country to the Negroes whom they have hitherto holden in bondage.</P>
<P>Thus it &s;eems, that they will be nece&s;&s;itated by Providence to make in one way or another com|pen&s;ation to the Negroes for the injury which they have done them. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, by taking them into affinity with them&s;elves, giving them their own &s;ons and daughters in marriage, and making them and their po&s;terity the heirs of all their pro|perty and all their honours, and by rai&s;ing their co|lour to a partial whitene&s;s, whereby a part at lea&s;t of that mark which brings on them &s;o much con|tempt will be wiped off. In the other ca&s;e, by leaving to them all their real e&s;tates. It is mani|fe&s;t, by the bare &s;tating of the two ca&s;es, that the compen&s;ation in the latter ca&s;e is by much the lea&s;t. In the former ca&s;e, the compen&s;ation will include all that is included in the latter, and much more. If therefore our &s;outhern brethren, and the inha|bitants of the We&s;t-Indies, would balance their ac|counts with their Negro &s;laves at the cheape&s;t po&s;&s;i|ble rate, they will doubtle&s;s judge it prudent, to
<PB N="37" REF="024292_0037_0FC616A9DCFEBAC0">

<P>It is not to be doubted, but that the Negroes in the&s;e northern &s;tates al&s;o will, in time, mix with the common ma&s;s of the people.

<HEAD>A &s;hort Sketch of the Evidence for the Abolition of the SLAVE-TRADE, delivered before a Committee of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons.</HEAD>
<P>VIRTUE, &s;ay morali&s;ts, is &s;o tran&s;cendently beautiful, that &s;he need but be <HI>&s;een,</HI> to be uni|ver&s;ally admired: and is not VICE &s;o hateful, that the more its features are <HI>viewed,</HI> the more it will be avoided? The traffic in the human &s;pecies, particu|larly as carried on by the Europeans on the coa&s;t of Africa, has &s;o horrible an a&s;pect, than nothing, one &s;hould think, but the MASK, under which it has been concealed, could have prevented all the ci|vilized nations in the world uniting to drive the de|te&s;ted mon&s;ter from the face of, the earth. This MASK is, however, at length taken away, and the traffic &s;tands expo&s;ed in all its real, unalterable de|formity. The PEOPLE are now called upon to be|hold, to feel, and judge for them&s;elves. The re|pre&s;entations of former writers on this &s;ubject were roundly denied; the facts they &s;tated were not only contradicted, but deemed impo&s;&s;ible, and the authors them&s;elves were accu&s;ed of &s;lander.

And now it appears, that one half of the tale of human mi&s;ery hath not been told; and that every principle, than can bind a man

<P>The evidence delivered before the Select Commit|tee of the Hou&s;e of Commons is very voluminous, occupying two thou&s;and pages in folio.

<P>In the preface to this important volume of evi|dence we read of rewards offered for taking run-away Negroes <HI>alive or dead</HI>&mdash;of laws being required to be made to prevent the practice of <HI>cutting off ears, no&s;es and tongues&mdash;</HI> of <HI>breaking limbs</HI> and <HI>putting one eyes</HI>&mdash;to prevent <HI>di&s;tempered, maimed, and worn out Negroes</HI> from infe&s;ting towns&mdash;to prevent <HI>aged</HI> and <HI>infirm</HI> Negroes being driven from the plantations <HI>to &s;tarve.</HI> We meet al&s;o with &s;uch kind of preambles to acts as the following, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>'Whereas the extreme cruelty and inhumanity of the managers, over&s;eers, and book-keepers of e&s;tates, have frequently driven &s;laves into the woods, and oc|ca&s;ioned rebellions, internal insurrections, &amp;c. And whereas al&s;o it frequently happens, that &s;laves come to their deaths by ha&s;ty and &s;evere blows, and other improper treatment of over&s;eers and book-keepers, in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion; and when &s;uch accidents do happen, the victims are entered in the plantation-books as having died of convul&s;ions, fits, or other cau&s;es not to be accounted for: and to conceal the

real truth of the cau&s;e of the death of &s;uch &s;lave or &s;laves, he or they is or are immediately put under ground,' &amp;c. Other preambles of a &s;imilar complex|ion, re&s;pecting the lodging, food and clothes of Ne|groes, are here to be met with. We al&s;o find that run-away negroes, when adverti&s;ed, are de&s;cribed by the various brands upon their &s;houlders, brea&s;ts, cheeks, and foreheads. A woman is de&s;cribed with a wooden leg; a man as having both his ears cropt, and another by his no&s;e and ears being cut off. Cornwall Chronicle, Nov 7, 1789. Other in|&s;tances occur within the year 1791.</P>
<P>The FIRST CHAPTER contains an account of the enormities committed by the natives of Africa on the per&s;ons of one another, to procure &s;laves for the Europeans, proved by the te&s;timony of &s;uch as have vi&s;ited that continent&mdash;and confirmed by accounts from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them&s;elves, after their arrival in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Under this head, we learn that kidnapping, or, as the natives call it, panyaring, is very common; that war is made on purpo&s;e to procure &s;laves. The king's &s;oldiers &s;et fire to villages in the night, and &s;eize the wretched inhabitants as they attempt to e&s;cape from the flames, and many peri&s;h either by the fire or &s;word in the execution of this horrid pur|po&s;e. A boy, who was carried away in the night from his father's hou&s;e, &s;ays, he believes both his parents were killed; he is &s;ure that one was; and that many others were killed, and &s;ome taken. Various in&s;tances are mentioned of con&s;ummate treachery em|ployed in making captives. Kidnapping is profe&s;|&s;ionally followed; large parties go up the country three hundred miles, to drive down captives&mdash;they go a wood-ranging, and pick up every one they meet, and &s;trip them naked. The purcha&s;ers generally &s;ay, they do not care how the &s;ellers come by their
<PB N="41" REF="024292_0041_0FC616B7707267A0">
&s;laves. Many are &s;old for crimes fal&s;ely imputed&punc; the Judges participate the profits of the fale, and are therefore &s;trongly induced to condemn the innocent. Crimes are invented and multiplied for the purpo&s;e of traffic. The great men dre&s;s up and employ women, to entice young men to be connected with them, that they may be convicted of adultery, and &s;old. The &s;laves are &s;eparated without the lea&s;t re|gard to ties of con&s;anguinity, or the pathetic expo&s;|tulations and remon&s;trances of nature. When &s;lave-&s;hips are on the coa&s;t, the natives go armed, but are no where &s;afe. The man, invited to drink with his neighbour, on ri&s;ing to go, is &s;eized by two of them, and a large dog: and this mode of &s;eizure is com|mon.</P>
<P>By the SECOND CHAPTER it appears that the Eu|ropeans, by means of the trade in &s;laves, are the occa&s;ion of the before mentioned enormities; that they &s;ometimes u&s;e additional means to excite the natives to practi&s;e them, often attempt them&s;elves to &s;teal the natives, and &s;ucceed, force trade as they plea&s;e, and are guilty of inju&s;tice in their dealings. In proof of this charge, we learn from the evidence, that Africans receive European goods in exchange for &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aves&mdash;that they declare when &s;hips cea&s;e to come (as in times of war) &s;laves cea&s;e to be taken. African dealers make the Princes drunk, in order to overcome their aver&s;ion to unprovoked war: they furni&s;h the natives with arms and ammunition, and excite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to pillage.</P>
<P>The term war, in Africa, is u&s;ed in general to &s;ignify pillage; and when many towns are &s;een blaz|ing in the night, the natives &s;ay war is carrying on.</P>
<P>The traders advance goods to Chiefs, to induce them to &s;eize their &s;ubjects or neighbours. Capt. Patter&s;on &s;et two villages at variance, and brought pri&s;oners from both &s;ides. It is not uncommon to
<PB N="42" REF="024292_0042_0FC616B8D8DC9FC0">
make the natives drunk, and then buy them&punc; General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ke &s;ays, that it was propo&s;ed to him, by three Engli&s;h captains of &s;hips, to kidnap a hundred, or a hundred and fifty men, women and children, king Damel's &s;ubjects, who had come to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ree in con&s;e|quence of the friendly intercour&s;e between him and Damel: he refu&s;ed, and was much &s;hocked by the propo&s;ition.

The Greg&s;on's people, in running down the coa&s;t, kidnapped thirty-two of the natives. The Dob&s;on's boat&punc; of Liverpool, had &s;tolen a man and woman; the Captain, on the remon&s;trance of Caps. Briggs, who told him there would be no more trade if he did not deliver up his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> captives&punc; re&s;tored them; upon which the natives loaded a boat with yams; goats; fowls, honey, and palm wine, and would take nothing for them;&mdash;a &s;triking in&s;tance of for|givene&s;s of injuries, and of unmerited kindne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

Dr. Trotter has &s;een the &s;laves drawing their breath with all tho&s;e laborious and anxious efforts for life, which are ob&s;erved in expiring animals, &s;ubjected by experiment to foul air, or in the exhau&s;ted receiver of an air pump: they cry out&mdash;'we are dying, and many are irrecoverably lo&s;t by &s;uffocation, having had no previous &s;igns of indi&s;po&s;ition. They are clo&s;ely wedged together, and have not &s;o much room as a man in his coffin&punc; either in length or breadth. They &s;ometimes go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">own well at night, and are found dead in the morning. Alexander Falconbridge was never among them for ten minutes together below, but his &s;hirt was as wet as if dipped in water. Sometimes the dead and living are found &s;hackled together. They lie on the bare planks, and the prominent parts of their bones, about the &s;houlder-blade and knees, have frequently been &s;een bare. No &s;ituation can be conceived &s;o dreadful and di&s;gu&s;ting as that of &s;laves when ill of the flux. In the Alexander (A. Falconbridge &s;ays) the deck was covered with blood and mucus, and re&s;embled, a &s;laughter-hou&s;e; the &s;tench and foul air were intolerable. The &s;laves&punc; &s;hackled together, frequently quarrel and make a great di&s;|turbance. Some refu&s;e food and medicine, and de|clare they want to die. In &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">es compul&s;ion is u&s;ed. The &s;hips are &s;o fitted up as to prevent, by net-work, the &s;laves jumping overboard; notwith|&s;tanding which they often attempt it, and &s;ometimes &s;ucceed, &s;hewing &s;igns of exultation in the very jaws of death.

<P>A &s;hip from Africa, with about four hundred &s;laves on board, &s;truck upon &s;ome &s;hoals, called the Morant Keys, di&s;tant eleven leagues S. S. E. off the ea&s;t end of a Jamaica. The officers and &s;eamen of the &s;hip landed in their, boats, carrying with them arms and provi&s;ions. The &s;laves were left on board in their irons and &s;hackles. This happened in the night time. When morning came, it was di&s;co|vered that the Negroes had got out of their irons, and were bu&s;y making rafts, upon which they placed the women and children; the men who were ca|pable of &s;wimming attended upon the rafts, whil&s;t they drifted before the wind towards the i&s;land where the &s;eamen had landed. From an apprehen&s;ion that
<PB N="46" REF="024292_0046_0FC616C81DE3A068">
the Negroes would con&s;ume the water and provi|&s;ions which the &s;eamen had landed, they came to the re&s;olution of de&s;troying them, by means of their fire arms and other weapons. As the poor wretches approached the &s;hore, they actually de&s;troyed be|tween three and four hundred of them. Out of the whole cargo only thirty-three or thirty-four were &s;av|ed and brought to King&s;ton, where they wore &s;old at public vendue.</P>
<P>When the &s;hips arrive at their de&s;tined ports, the cargo of &s;laves is &s;old, either by &s;cramble of vendue.

The field-&s;laves begin their work at break of day. They work in rows, without exception, under the whip of drivers, and the weak are made to keep up with the &s;trong. They continue their labour (with two intermi&s;&s;ions, half an hour during the morning, and two hours at noon) till &s;un-&s;et. In the Intervals they are made to pick gra&s;s for the cattle. Cook has known pregnant women worked and flogged a few days before their delivery. Some, however, are a little indulged when in that &s;tate. After the month they work with the children on their backs. In the crop-&s;ea&s;on the labour is of much longer duration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On &s;ome e&s;tates it is u&s;ual to dig a hole in the ground, in which they put the bellies of pregnant women, while they whip them, that they may not e&s;cape puni&s;hment, nor yet endanger the life of the woman or child.</NOTE>. The &s;laves &s;ometimes work &s;o long that they cannot help &s;leeping, and then it not unfrequently happens, that their arms are caught in the mill and torn off. They are &s;aid to be allowed one day in &s;even for re&s;t, but this time is nece&s;&s;arily employed in rai&s;ing food for the other days, and gathering gra&s;s for their ma&s;|ters cattle. The be&s;t allowance of food is at Barba|dos, which is a pint of grain for twenty-four hours, and half a rotten herring, when to be had. When the herrings are unfit for the whites, they are bought up by planters for the &s;laves. Some allow nine pints of corn a week, and about one pound of &s;alt fi&s;h, which is the greate&s;t allowance mentioned in the whole cour&s;e of the evidence. Some have no provi&s;ion but what they rai&s;e them&s;elves, and they are frequently &s;o fatigued by the labour of the re&s;t of the week, as &s;carcely to be able to work for their own &s;upport on the Sunday. And the land allotted them for this pur|po&s;e is often at the di&s;tance of three miles from their hou&s;es; it would, however, be quite ample for their &s;upport, were they allowed time &s;ufficient for its cul|tivation.

Sometimes when they have been at the pains of clearing their land, their ma&s;ters take it for canes, and give them wood-land in&s;tead of it. This hard&s;hip &s;ome have &s;o taken to heart as to die. Pu|trid carca&s;es are burnt; if they were buried, the &s;laves would dig them up and eat them, which would breed di&s;tempers among them. They are &s;ometimes driven by extreme hunger to &s;teal, at the hazard of their lives. They are badly clothed; one half of them go almo&s;t naked. The &s;laves in general have no bed or b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dding at all. Their hou&s;es are built with four poles, and that<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">. They have little or no property. All the evidence (to whom the que&s;tion has been propo&s;ed) agree in an&s;wering, that they never knew or heard of a field-&s;lave ever ama&s;&s;ing &s;uch a &s;um, as enabled him to purcha&s;e his own freedom. The artificers, &s;uch as hou&s;e-carpenters, coopers, ma&s;ons, the drivers and head-&s;laves, are better off. The own|ers of women let them out for pro&s;titution, and flog them, if they do not bring home full wages.</P>
<P>The Negroes, when whipped, are &s;u&s;pended by the arms, with weights at their feet. They are fir&s;t whipped with a whip made of cow-&s;kin (which cuts, out the fle&s;h, whereas the military whips out only the &s;kin) and afterwards with ebony bu&s;hes (which are more prickly than thorn bu&s;hes in this country) in order to let out the congealed blood. Dr. Har|ri&s;on thinks the whipping too &s;evere to be inflicted on any human being: he could lay two or three fingers into the wounds of a man whipped for not coming when he was called. Many receive from one hundred and fifty to two hundred la&s;hes at a time; and in two or three days this is repeated: they wa&s;h the raw parts with pickle; this appears, from the convul&s;ions it occa&s;ions, more cruel than whipping; but it is done to prevent mortification.

<P>The offences for which the before mentioned pu|ni&s;hments are inflicted are, not coming into the field in time, not picking a &s;ufficient quantity of gra&s;s, not appearing willing to work, when in fact &s;ick and not able; for &s;taying too long on an errand, for not coming immediately when called, for not bringing home (the women) the full weekly &s;um enjoined by their owners; for running away, and for theft, to which they are often driven by hunger.</P>

<P>In the FIFTH CHAPTER it is proved, by &s;uch as have &s;een them in their own country, that the natives of Africa are equal to the Europeans in their natural capacities, feelings, affections, and moral character. They manufacture gold and iron, in &s;ome re&s;pects equal to the European arti&s;ts&mdash;al&s;o cloth and leather with uncommon neatne&s;s; the former they did blue, yellow, brown and orange. They are &s;killed in mak|ing indigo and &s;oap, and pottery wares, and prepare fall for their own u&s;e from the &s;ea water. They al&s;o make ropes with aloes. With re&s;pect to their moral character, they are very hone&s;t and ho&s;pitable grate|ful and affectionate, harmle&s;s and innocent; punctu|al in their dealings, and as capable of virtue as the whites. They are &s;u&s;ceptible of all the &s;ocial virtues: genero&s;ity, fidelity, and gratitude, are allowed them by Dr. Stuart. The&s;e virtues Dr. Jack&s;on enume|rates, and adds charity to all in di&s;tre&s;s, and a &s;trong attachment on the part of parents to their children. T. Woolrich &s;ays, he never knew of an African, who could expre&s;s him&s;elf, that did not believe in the exi&s;tence of a Supreme Being.</P>
<P>In the SIXTH and SEVENTH CHAPTERS it appears, that the natives po&s;&s;e&s;s indu&s;try and a &s;pirit of com|merce, &s;ufficient for carrying on a new trade; that their country abounds with, and might ea&s;ily be made &s;till more productive of, many and various articles of commerce; but that the traffic in &s;laves is an in&s;u|perable impediment to opening a new trade.</P>
<P>In the TENTH CHAPTER it is proved not to be true, what &s;ome &s;ay, that the natives of Africa are happier in the European colonies than in their own
<PB N="54" REF="024292_0054_0FC616DCDAFFD5B0">
country. They love their own country, but de&s;troy them&s;elves in the colonies, &amp;c. &amp;c. But any com|pari&s;on between the two &s;ituations, is (as H. Ro&s;s &s;ays, though on another occa&s;ion) <HI><Q>an in&s;ult to com|mon &s;en&s;e.</Q></HI></P>
<P>The ELEVENTH, TWELETH and THIRTEENTH CHAPTERS, are on the &s;ubject of Negro population in the colonies, and plainly &s;hew that the importa|tion of fre&s;h Africans might immediately be &s;uperceded&punc; by the introduction of general good treat|ment and of certain &s;alutary regulations therein &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>The FOURTEENTH CHAPTER is employed to de|mon&s;trate, from the evidence before the committee, that the coloni&s;ts would be able to carry on the nece&s;&s;ary cultivation of their lands, without a fre&s;h importation of &s;laves, while the generation imme|diately &s;ucceeding the regulations propo&s;ed were growing up, to &s;upply the vacancies occa&s;ioned by the natural deaths of the &s;laves of all ages, now is their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The FIFTEENTH CHAPTER enquires, whether there be not a prevailing opinion, in the colonies, that it is cheaper to buy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> import &s;laves than thus to increa&s;e them by population. And whether the very &s;evere of this opinion be not true: namely, that it is more profitable to breed than to import. The re&s;ult of this enquiry is clearly in favour of the <HI>immediate</HI> abo|lition of the African &s;lave-trade. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>and la&s;t</HI> chapter, in which it is con&s;idered, whether is be more political to extend the cultivation of the colonies by the continuance of the &s;lave-trade, or wait till the ri&s;ing generation &s;hall be capable of performing it.</P>
