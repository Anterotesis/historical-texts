<P>REASON, that principle which the Author of our exi&s;tence implanted in our brea&s;t, is &s;ufficient to teach us, The offspring of one common parent ought to live in con&s;tant harmony: And the in&s;pired writings abound with exhor|tations to mutual affection, together with the interchange of tho&s;e kind offices, which are e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of families, and of larger &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>THE true felicity of tho&s;e who dwell together in unity, is de&s;cribed in the old te&s;tament, by &s;ome of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing figures of ea&s;tern language. "Behold,"

&s;ays King David, "How good and how plea&s;ant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity. It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the &s;kirts of his garments. As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that de&s;cended upon the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord commanded the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for ever more."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm. 133.</NOTE>&mdash;And the great founder of our Religion, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath a&s;&s;ured us, we cannot be his di&s;ciples, nor may we hope to &s;hare in the peculiar ble&s;&s;ings which he hath purcha&s;ed, unle&s;s we feel the influence of kind affection one towards another. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John, 13, 34, 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT a &s;hocking rever&s;e, to what rea&s;on dictates, and the &s;criptures enjoin, have the actions of mankind exhibited, in all ages of the world.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the human race, from Adam to the pre&s;ent day, is gloomy and affecting. In the very page where we read, "Men began to multiply on the face of the earth," it is al&s;o written, "God &s;aw the wickedne&s;s of man was great, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his
<PB N="7" REF="015866_0005_0F9A309ACEA38F00">
heart, was only evil continually." And a little after we read, &mdash;"The earth al&s;o was filled with violence." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;es, vi. Chap.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS is the account which comes to us by in&s;piration from heaven: Such were the offspring of Adam before the flood, generally abandoned to their lu&s;ts, and under the government of the vile&s;t pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>SHOULD we now look into the records of human actions, which have been pre|&s;erved by faithful men from the earlie&s;t times, we &s;hall find the volums &s;well with the &s;ad narrative of fraud, inju&s;tice, rapine, murder&mdash;and every kind of violence.&mdash;</P>
<P>BY violence we under&s;tand an unlawful application of force, or the arbitrary &s;tretch of power which unrea&s;onable and wicked men, have frequently exerci&s;ed over &s;uch as were under their controul.</P>
<P>AGE, natural &s;uperiority, and a great variety of circum&s;tances, give &s;ome of the children of men opportunity to rule over others. And &s;uch is the love of power, which has generally been di&s;covered by the Sons of Adam, that tho&s;e who had a little were con&s;tantly wi&s;hing for more; and
<PB N="8" REF="015866_0006_0F9A309B8F9D67F0">
tho&s;e who had arrived to great authority, grew impatient of re&s;traint, and wi&s;hed for ab&s;olute dominion.</P>
<P>PARENTS have been guilty of violence towards their children: Although the ties of nature oblige them to treat their off|&s;pring with the tendere&s;t affection, there have been in&s;tances of a very different conduct: there have been in&s;tances where it was nece&s;&s;ary to apply the Apo&s;tolic cau|tion, "Ye fathers provoke not your chil|dren to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;ians vi.4.</NOTE></P>
<P>MASTERS have been guilty of violence towards their &s;ervants: Men of unrea&s;on|able pa&s;&s;ions, have treated their &s;laves and dependants with great inhumanity, not remembering that "their Ma&s;ter al&s;o is in Heaven," <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. vi, 9.</NOTE> to whom they mu&s;t give an account.</P>
<P>THE rich have been guilty of violence towards the poor: They have in many ca&s;es extorted from them &s;ervices without returning a &s;uitable reward. The Apo&s;tle James addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf to covetous op|pre&s;&s;ors in the following language. "Behold
<PB N="9" REF="015866_0007_0F9A309C4DB0FD58">
the hire of the laborers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">d, crieth, and the cries of them which have reaped, have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James v.4.</NOTE></P>
<P>GOVERNORS and rulers of the earth, have been guilty of violence towards their &s;ubjects. Solomon informs us, he "return|ed and con&s;idered all the oppre&s;&s;ions that are done under the Sun, and behold the tears of &s;uch as were oppre&s;&s;ed and they had no comforters; and on the &s;ide of their oppre&s;&s;ors there was power; but they had no comforters." <NOTE N="&sect;." PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. iv.i.</NOTE> Such was the melancholy &s;tate of the children of men, while under cruel oppre&s;&s;ors, that the wi&s;e King of I&s;rael adds, &mdash;"I prai&s;ed the dead which are already dead, more than the living, which are yet alive."&mdash;</P>
<P>AND &s;hould we ca&s;t an eye over the Kingdoms of the world at the pre&s;ent day, we &s;hall di&s;cover the effects of oppre&s;&s;ion and violence, on every quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>AMBITIOUS and haughty men, by &s;uc|ce&s;s in war, or by taking advantage of the weakne&s;s or inattention of their neighbors, have e&s;tabli&s;hed de&s;poti&s;m over the greate&s;t

part of the earth. And while &s;ome nations have pre&s;erved more liberties than others, none have e&s;caped attacks from the com|mon enemy of human freedom.</P>
<P>NORTH-AMERICA, which &s;eemed to have been re&s;erved in divine providence, as the la&s;t retreat of a virtuous few, who were determined never to yield tho&s;e rights which they had received from Heaven to the will of any temporal monarch, has, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, been threatned with &s;lavery and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>UNWEARIED attempts have been made by the powers of Great-Britain to deprive the inhabitants of this land of their mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts; and compel them, by violence and cruelty, to lay them&s;elves, with every thing precious to them, at a Tyrant's feet: Ye, &s;o determined is that prince who now di&s;graces the throne of his ance&s;tors, to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>ab&s;olute Government,</HI> through the &s;everal parts, of what he calls, "<HI>his dominions,</HI>" that he would rather &s;pill the blood of millions, and expo&s;e him&s;elf, as well as the Nation to infamy and ruin, than abandon an object &s;o plea&s;ing to him, and which he promi&s;es his parliament he "<HI>will &s;teadily pur&s;ue.</HI>" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Speech Nov. 20. 1777.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="015866_0009_0F9A309E6DEC39C0">THE inhabitants of this State, received the fir&s;t attacks which were made by the enemy, on the common rights of America. &mdash;The &s;ons of violence fir&s;t pointed the in&s;truments of death at our brea&s;ts.&mdash;</P>
<P>I MIGHT now call you, my friends and fellow citizens, to remember the fifth of March, One thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy.&mdash;I might call you to view the ground, where the blood of our brethren was mo&s;t wantonly &s;pilled on that memor|able night, but your feelings, I know, will be &s;ufficiently touched by the worthy Gen|tleman, who, at the de&s;ire of the Town, will &s;oon pronounce an Oration from this de&s;k.</P>
<P>THE &s;hocking ma&s;&s;acre, perpetrated on that gloomy evening, which we &s;hall never forget, may be con&s;ider'd as the commence|ment of ho&s;tilities by the Briti&s;h troops in America: And the inhabitants of the&s;e States, mu&s;t have been ju&s;tified by the impartial world, had they re&s;olved from that moment, never to &s;uffer one in the livery of George the III to walk this ground.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch was our patience under ag|gravated in&s;ults&mdash;&s;uch our hopes that after all, the unhappy di&s;pute might be amicably &s;ettled, that we &s;aw forces collecting from

all quarters without re&s;i&s;ting them.&mdash;We &s;aw the &s;acred Charters, which had been given, by former Kings of England to the fir&s;t planters of the&s;e Colonies&mdash;We &s;aw tho&s;e &s;acred Charters which confirmed to us the e&s;&s;ential rights of freemen, the &s;port of a prince, who was bound by &s;olemn ties to ob&s;erve them.</P>
<P>OPPOSITION was not made to that force which we &s;aw collecting again&s;t us, till our enemies carried fire and &s;word into the heart of the country.</P>
<P>NEVER &s;hall we forget the ninteenth of April, One thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-five, when a number of Americans were murdered at LEXINGTON, and we heard the fir&s;t &s;olemn call, to <HI>arm,</HI> and oppo&s;e the &s;trength of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>SINCE the &s;word on both &s;ides has been drawn, the operations of war, on the part of the enemy, have been cruel beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion. &mdash;Conque&s;t has not been the &s;ole object of their exertions.&mdash;Deva&s;tation, barbarity and murder, have been their delight.</P>

NORFOLK, one of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Towns in Virginia, was wholly con&s;umed in the month of January, 1776. KINGSTON, the third Town in the State of New-York, was reduced to a&s;hes in the month of October, 1777.&mdash;Be&s;ides the wanton de&s;truction of the&s;e places, between 4 and 500 hou&s;es were pulled down and burnt in Bo&s;ton, while the town was held by Briti&s;h troops.&mdash;The enemy took peculiar plea&s;ure in abu&s;ing the hou&s;es erected for the wor&s;hip of God. One <HI>venerable pile,</HI> known by the name of the OLD-NORTH was torn to pieces by the &s;ons of violence; tho&s;e wretches accompaning their impious work, with language too profane and bla&s;phemous to relate.&mdash; One large and elegant Building was &s;hamefully defaced, and u&s;ed as a Manage for their <HI>Hor&s;e.</HI> Three others, and one among them the mo&s;t fini&s;hed and expen&s;ive on the Continent, were pro&s;tituted to the purpo&s;es of Barracks; and one was u&s;ed as a Barn to contain fodder for their Cattle.&mdash;</NOTE></P>

Burgoyne, in whom the fine Gentleman is united with the Soldier and the Scholar, &s;hould hire the Savages of America to &s;calp Europians, and the de&s;cendants of Europians: Nay more, that he &s;hould pay a price for each &s;calp &s;o barbarou&s;ly taken, is more than will be believed in Europe, until authenticated facts, &s;hould in every Gazette con|firm the truth of the horrid tale.&mdash;Mi&s;s M'Rea, a Lady lovely to the &s;ight, of virtuous character, and amiable di&s;po&s;ition, engaged to be married to an officer in your army, was, with other women and children, taken out of a hou&s;e near Fort-Edward, and carried into the woods, and there &s;calped and mangled in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner. Two parents, with their &s;ix children, were all treated with the &s;ame inhumanity, while quietly re&s;iding in their once peaceful dwellings. The mi&s;erable fate of Mi&s;s M'Rea was par|ticularly aggravated, by her being dre&s;&s;ed to receive her promi&s;ed hu&s;band, but met her murderer, employed by you.

<P>SUCH acts of meanne&s;s and cruelty have our enemies been guilty of.&mdash;Such are the men who have promi&s;ed their haughty ma&s;ter, that by deva&s;tation and &s;laughter they will compel the inhabitants of the&s;e States to yield unconditional &s;ubjection to his plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>DIVINE goodne&s;s is to be acknowledg|ed in rai&s;ing up men of the <HI>fir&s;t abilities</HI> to watch over our common rights, and give us warning when tho&s;e rights were invaded.&mdash;We e&s;teem <HI>converts</HI> to the true intere&s;t of our country, and rejoice to &s;ee any come in even at the eleventh hour, and join heartily in the cau&s;e of virtue and freedom; but we revere tho&s;e characters which <HI>fir&s;t</HI> appeared, and in oppo&s;ition to every danger, boldly impeached the ene|mies of our liberties, and conjured us by

<P>HOW remarkably hath divine provi|dence taken us up when our circum&s;tances were mo&s;t perplexing and difficult?</P>
<P>HEAVEN hath frequently &s;ent us &s;up|plies of warlike &s;tores when in great want of them; and prevented the enemy from acting with vigour again&s;t us, when we were prepared but feebly to re&s;i&s;t them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a time after the Battle on the Heights of Charle&s;town when our army, which was not large, had not nine rounds of powder to a man, nor was any tolerable &s;upply procured till an ordnance Brig was taken by Capt. <HI>Manley,</HI> &s;ome time in Dec. 1775.

<P>IT is &s;eriou&s;ly to be wi&s;hed, all ranks of people would meditate on the mi&s;erable condition we &s;hall be in, if we &s;uffer our|&s;elves to be &s;ubdued by Great-Britain.</P>
<P>MANY are engaged in the eager pur&s;uit of riches&mdash;many are intrigueing for places of honor and profit, as inattentive to the public intere&s;t, as if our country were out of danger.&mdash;But what advantage, let me a&s;k tho&s;e men,&mdash;what advantage can you expect to receive from your wealth, or your titles, if America is at la&s;t &s;ubjected to Briti&s;h tyranny?&mdash;Should that ever take place, through a general &s;tupidity, or

want of exertion, your wealth, e&s;pecially if it has been acquired in the pre&s;ent war, and your titles which you hold under tho&s;e who are denominated by the Briti&s;h go|vernment, <HI>The leaders of the rebellion,</HI> &s;o far from being of any &s;ervice will expo&s;e you to the peculiar vengeance of your ene|mies &mdash;You will be &s;tript of your money, of your lands, and your honours, if not deprived of life it&s;elf:&mdash;Or &s;hould your e&s;tates be &s;pared to you, they will be &s;o burdened with taxes, to defray the ex|pences of the war,&mdash;to &s;upport a large &s;tanding army to hold the country in &s;ub|jection after it is once conquered, and maintain a &s;warm of crown officers to govern, to plunder and in&s;ult you, that your e&s;tates would not be worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing: &mdash;Yea, death would be de&s;irable rather than a life of &s;uch di&s;honor and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>MUCH might be &s;aid to de&s;cribe the common wretchedne&s;s in which the in|habitants of this country mu&s;t be involved, if they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;ubdued,&mdash; but the time allowed me for this exerci&s;e, will not &s;uffer me any farther to enlarge.</P>
<P>AT &s;uch a day as this, when we are threatned with the lo&s;s of every thing va|luable,&mdash;when our enemies are many and powerful, we &s;hould forget, in &s;ome good mea&s;ure, that we have a private intere&s;t:
<PB N="22" REF="015866_0020_0F9A2FE9D2BA1528">
We &s;hould employ our utmo&s;t vigour in the cau&s;e of the public. A Roman <HI>Hero</HI> informs us, at a time when the liberties of the people required his &s;ervices, <HI>he gave him&s;elf to the immortal Gods, and to his country;</HI> after that &s;olemn con&s;ecration he declares he was happy. His conduct affords an example worthy of our imitation.&mdash; Every freeborn &s;on of America &s;hould at <HI>this time</HI> devote him&s;elf to the God of Heaven, and to the &s;ervice of the&s;e United States.</P>
<P>AT once de&s;pi&s;ing danger, and the <HI>pal|try</HI> idea of profit, Americans &s;hould at this time &s;olemnly vow unto the Lord, that they will give them&s;elves no re&s;t, till our common enemies are wholly &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>SHOULD this magnanimity of &s;oul&mdash;this heavenly principle in&s;pire our bo&s;oms: &s;hould it happily exterminate that mean|ne&s;s of &s;pirit&mdash;that criminal &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s&mdash; that inordinate love of money which have imbarra&s;&s;ed every thing for &s;ome time pa&s;t, we might defy the forces of Britain, and laugh at her threats.</P>
<P>HOW ardently then is this noble affection &mdash;this enthu&s;ia&s;m for the public good to be de&s;ired! May it kindle up in &s;ome favorite brea&s;t! May it catch from &s;oul to &s;oul, till the inhabitants of this land in general, feeling the irre&s;i&s;table in&s;&s;uence, &s;hall unite in one vigorous effort again&s;t the enemies of our

civil and religious liberties and put an end to their exi&s;tence on this part of the world.</P>
<P>NOW is the time, the be&s;t time in all probability we &s;hall ever have: If we act with wi&s;dom and &s;pirit the forces at pre|&s;ent employed again&s;t us may be ruined before they can be joined by larger numbers. God forbid my country &s;hould let this golden opportunity pa&s;s over unimproved! God grant tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with our public affairs may act with wi&s;dom, with &s;pirit, and deci&s;ion! And may there be &s;ufficient numbers ready to take the field at this mo&s;t critical &s;ea&s;on!</P>
<P>BUT before we conclude, it becomes us as chri&s;tians to lament the awful &s;pread of moral evil, and pray for the univer&s;al e&s;|tabli&s;hment of the Redeemer's kingdom, which is a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace.</P>
<P>SHOCKING have been the calamities which have followed &s;in in every age of the world.&mdash;The earth was &s;oon filled with violence, and its wicked inhabitants were drowned with the flood.&mdash;Far the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who now dwell on the face of the earth are at once abandoned to their lu&s;ts, and are in &s;lavery to arbitrary &s;ove|reigns.&mdash;But the reign of moral evil &s;hall not be perpetual.&mdash;The Son of God came into the world to de&s;troy the works of the

devil.&mdash;He will put an end to violence and oppre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;He will over&s;et the thrones which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by wickedne&s;s, and give univer&s;al peace to the inhabitants of the world.</P>
<P>THE time &s;hall come, when according to prophetic language "The wolf &s;hall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard &s;hall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion, and the fattling together." And to give us a repre&s;entation of an uni|ver&s;ally pacific di&s;po&s;ition, it is added, "And a little child &s;hall lead them."&mdash; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah 11.6.</NOTE></P>
<P>LET us look forward to that Day with plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. In the mean time let us unite in earne&s;t prayers to Almighty God, that the &s;ons of vi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">nce may be utterly &s;ubdued, and that peace may &s;peedily return, and &s;pread her balmy wings over this bleeding land.</P>
<P>WE pray for the peace of our Jeru&s;alem. "They &s;hall pro&s;per that love thee.&mdash; Peace be within thy walls and pro&s;perity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions &s;akes, I will now &s;ay, peace be within thee." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pla&s;m. 122.</NOTE></P>
