<P>THE de&s;ign of the Author in publi&s;hing the following pages, being not merely to amu&s;e gentlemen of the faculty, but for the general benefit of all &s;uch as may be prompted by motives of intere&s;t or curio&s;ity to peru&s;e them; he has endeavored for that rea&s;on to render his &s;hort treati&s;e as intelligible as po&s;&s;ible, by carefully avoiding the unnece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of technical and ab&s;tru&s;e phra&s;es and confining him&s;elf to as plain and familiar terms as the nature of the &s;ubject would admit.</P>
<P>But having nece&s;&s;arily made u&s;e in certain in&s;tances in the phra&s;eology of the late Dr. Brown, of the terms Ex|citability&mdash;excitability redundant and excitability ex|hau&s;ted, has thought proper to tender the following defini|tion as the &s;en&s;e in which he wi&s;hes the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>By excitability is meant that principle of &s;u&s;ceptibility inherent in all animated nature, but more obvious in the animal world, that capacity of being acted upon by the application of certain external agents or powers de&s;igned by the wi&s;e author of nature for the &s;upport and con|tinuence of our animal exi&s;tence; among which agents or powers are included meat, drink, exerci&s;e, air, mental pa&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. In &s;hort every thing which &s;erves to excite or quicken the wheels of action in the &s;y&s;tem. And the&s;e agents or exciting powers are denominated &s;timulants.</P>
<P>By <HI>excitability redundant,</HI> is to be under&s;tood that irritable week and infeebled &s;tate of the body, induced by a privation or withholding the agency or aid of the &s;timu|lating powers.</P>
<P>By <HI>excitability exhau&s;ted</HI> or wa&s;ted is meant that &s;tate of the body con&s;equent to a too free, too &s;trong, or a long continued application in certain ca&s;es, of the &s;timulating agents whereby the &s;u&s;ceptability is overpowered and finally extingui&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>VIEWING the ravages the Con&s;umption has made, and is &s;till making among mankind, and that not with an eye of indifference, and ob&s;erving, that, benefit derived from medical aid in &s;uch ca&s;es, fell much &s;hort of what is common in mo&s;t other complaints incident to the human frame, I was led to con&s;ider attentively the theory on which the common mode of practice was founded; to become very inqui&s;itive about the nature of this di&s;ea&s;e; to &s;earch the writing both ancient and modern of all the authors I could obtain on the &s;ubject, and carefully to examine its progre&s;s and operation on &s;uch as were affected with it, whenever opportunity pre&s;ented. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e re&s;earches I di&s;covered a new mode of practice, (fir&s;t adopted by Dr. May, and after him followed by &s;everal other gentlemen of the faculty,) at|tended with very flattering &s;ucce&s;s. This mode, is by the doctor &s;upported by rea&s;onings, warranted by ex|periment and ju&s;tified by facts, which clearly evince, that the inflammation heat, &amp;c. in the con&s;umption originate from a &s;ource, directly the rever&s;e of what had hitherto been the prevailing opinion, and point out in a very &s;triking manner the propriety of his new mode of practice. This di&s;covery afforded me not a little con&s;olation, and I was encouraged to hope, that the grating &s;ounds `<HI>If you have got the con&s;umption lay a&s;ide your phy&s;ician, he will do you more harm than good,</HI>' &s;o often pronounced by the friends of the &s;ick, might in proce&s;s of time be forever bani&s;hed from my ears; but my exultation was very much eclip&s;ed, when I found that &s;ome, be the cau&s;e what it might, were &s;till engaged in oppo&s;ition to what I &s;uppo&s;ed might be ju&s;tly &s;tiled, a new and valuable di&s;covery; while others le&s;s callous to conviction, a&s;&s;ented to the facts related; but at the &s;ame time, either from a wi&s;h to reconcile all parties, or out of re&s;pect to the eminency
<PB N="iv" REF="030645_0004_0FE7EE3F4BB0E3B0">of the &s;ounders of the former theory, were laboring to e&s;tabli&s;h a variety of the di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the identity of effect produced thereby on the human frame, &s;o incontrovertibly proves the identity of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;olicitous for the good of my countrymen and the honor of the profe&s;&s;ion (who&s;e merit depends on their u&s;efulne&s;s) and per&s;uaded that every hone&s;t attempt to correct error to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of di&s;ea&s;e, prevent its ravages and ameliorate the condition of mankind would meet with a candid and favorable re|ception. I have ventured to write and offer the fol|lowing &s;heets to the peru&s;al of the public, in which I have endeavored to inve&s;tigate the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, by carefully attending to its predi&s;po&s;ing and proximate cau&s;es, and by plain and &s;imple rea&s;oning &s;hew the pro|priety of the new mode. In the &s;ame method, I have endeavored to obviate &s;uch objections as occurred, by &s;hewing the mi&s;taken ground of the former theory and the impropriety of conceiving a variety or diver&s;ity of the di&s;ea&s;e. In pro&s;ecuting this bu&s;ine&s;s I found my&s;elf compelled, on account of the recency, plau&s;ibility and authority, of the writings of Dr. Ru&s;h, to make &s;everal &s;trictures on his arguments, as he, notwith&s;tanding his great di&s;cernment, appears &s;till to be entangled with the old doctrine, and has offered many things in its favor; not doubting, that in&s;tead of taking umbrage at the freedom, his benevolent mind, will place him among the fir&s;t to patronize this feeble effort in que&s;t of u&s;eful philo&s;ophy, more e&s;pecially when he reflects, that &s;uch is the condition of mortality, that no genius how|ever exalted is equal to every thing, that the greate&s;t in their attempts for u&s;eful di&s;covery have often been foiled, while others, who&s;e abilities would poorly com|pare, improving on their hints, have compa&s;&s;ed that knowledge which their wi&s;er preceptors had in vain labored to obtain.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="030645_0005_0FE7EE453AA10C68">Before I di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, it is with plea&s;ure I acknowledge my indebtedne&s;s to this great and valuable man for his a&s;&s;iduous attention to all the phenomena of the &s;ick, both in the di&s;ea&s;e treated of and every other that comes within his in&s;pection. The fulle&s;t confidence in the accuracy and candour with which his ob&s;erva|tions are made has induced me to &s;elect &s;uch of them as &s;uited my purpo&s;e in preference to my own and to make u&s;e of them as the ba&s;is of the following work.</P>
<P>The author con&s;idering that the greatne&s;s or ob&s;curity of a character by which a &s;y&s;tem in any of the &s;ciences is u&s;hered to the world may operate to the prejudice of further inve&s;tigation, either by being too implicitly fol|lowed in the one ca&s;e, or too incon&s;iderately rejected on the other, has cho&s;en to withhold his name from the public and leave the fate of his performance to be de|cided by its value in the opinion of the candid reader, to who&s;e ju&s;t &s;trictures it is re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted, by one who ardently wi&s;hes to alleviate human mi&s;ery and in|crea&s;e the happine&s;s of man.</P>

<HEAD>A New Treati&s;e, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BY the term CONSUMPTION, or PHTHISIS PULMONALIS is generally under&s;tood that &s;tate of indi&s;po&s;ition of the human &s;y&s;tem, wherein the patient is attended with a con&s;tant cough, accompanied with expectoration of purulent matter from the lungs, hectic fever, colliquative night &s;weats, general wa&s;ting of the body, and la&s;tly a colliquative diarrhoea accompanied with oedematus &s;wellings of the lower limbs; after which la&s;t ap|pearance life &s;oon clo&s;es its &s;cene. This is a general di&s;cription of this fatal malady. Some variations however may be ob&s;erved perhaps in viewing a vari|ety of ca&s;es; yet there will always be a &s;ufficient number of the&s;e leading traits to determine its &s;pecies.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the following pages I have attempted to inve&s;tigate its nature in order to devi&s;e &s;ome rational plan to obviate its baneful effects on the human &s;pecies. It will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary for me, <HI>Fir&s;tly,</HI> To enquire, what or whence its origin? Whether it is generated by a variety of cau&s;es, or proceeds from a &s;imple &s;ource. <HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e or &s;tate of the body producing the phenomena peculiar to it? Whether this &s;tate is different in different &s;ubjects, or in other words, are there more &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e than one?</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Thirdly.</HI> If there is a variety, how many, and their cau&s;es and nature?</P>
<P N="4">IV. In pur&s;uing my fir&s;t enquiry it appears to me to lead to &s;ources or powers who&s;e operations
<PB N="2" REF="030645_0007_0FE7EE4CEF366918">either directly or indirectly con&s;pire to debilitate our whole &s;y&s;tem; and far from being that local di&s;ea&s;e which has been imagined by many. Yet I think we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to conclude from its effects on the lungs, that the agency of the powers <HI>inducing debility</HI> produces a greater diathe&s;is on the lungs, than on any other given part of the &s;y&s;tem. This propo&s;ition, that it is a general di&s;ea&s;e, originating from debility has been &s;o ingeniou&s;ly treated, and clearly evinced by the celebrated Dr. Ru&s;h, in his 2 vol. medical enquiries, that I have cho&s;en to quote his view verbatim, as his ob&s;ervations on this part of the &s;ubject &s;o fully coincide with my own &s;enti|ments, except his &s;trict analogy with the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, and pneumoniac inflammation: in this I mu&s;t beg leave to differ. He begins by &s;aying, (page 86.)</P>
<P N="5">V.
<Q>That the Pulmonary Con&s;umption is a di&s;ea&s;e of debility.</Q></P>
<P N="6">VI.
<Q>This I infer, 1&s;t, from the remote and exciting cau&s;es which produce it. The remote cau&s;es, are pneumony, catarrh, haemopty&s;is, rheu|mati&s;m, gout, a&s;thma, &s;crophula, nervous and intermitting fevers, mea&s;les, repelled humors from the &s;urface of the body, the veneral di&s;ea&s;e, ob&s;tructed men&s;es, &s;udden growth about the age of puberty, grief, and all other debilitating pa&s;|&s;ions of the mind; hypochondria&s;is, improper lactation, exce&s;&s;ive evacuation of all kinds, more e&s;pecially by &s;tool,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Sir George Baker relates in the &s;econd volume of the medical tran&s;actions, that Dr. Blanchard had in|formed him that he had &s;een the con&s;umption brought on ten per&s;ons out of ninety, by exce&s;&s;ive purging u&s;ed to prepare the body for the &s;mall-pox. I have &s;een a ca&s;e of con&s;umption in a youth of 17, from the &s;pitting produced by the intemperate u&s;e of &s;egars.</Q></P></NOTE> cold and damp air, external

<P N="7">VII.
<Q>The mo&s;t frequent exciting cau&s;e of con&s;umption is the alternate application of heat and cold to the whole external &s;urface of the body, but all the remote cau&s;es which have been enu|merated, operate as exciting cau&s;es of con&s;ump|tion when they act on previous debility. Original injuries of the lungs &s;eldom induce this di&s;order except they fir&s;t induce a debility of the whole &s;y&s;tem by a trouble&s;ome and ob&s;tinate cough.</Q></P>
<P N="8">VIII.
<Q>2. From the occupations and habits of per&s;ons who are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;order. The&s;e are &s;tudious men, and mechanics who lead &s;eden|tary lives in confined places; al&s;o women, and all per&s;ons of irritable habits, whether of body or mind.</Q></P>
<P N="9">IX.
<Q>3. From the period in which per&s;ons are mo&s;t liable to be affected by this di&s;order. This is generally between the 18th and 36th year of life, a period in which the &s;y&s;tem is liable in a peculiar manner to mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es which induce the di&s;order, and in which indirect debility is oftener produced than in any other &s;tage of life, by the exce&s;&s;ive exerci&s;es of the body and mind in the pur&s;uits of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P N="10"><PB N="4" REF="030645_0009_0FE7EEF51BF9C9F8">X.
<Q>I have conformed to authors, in fixing the period of con&s;umptions between the 18th and 36th year of life, but it is well known that it &s;ome|times appears in children, and frequently in per|&s;ons beyond the 40th or even 50th year of life.</Q></P>
<P N="11">XI.
<Q>II. The pulmonary con&s;umption is a pri|mary di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem. This I infer,</Q></P>
<P N="12">XII
<Q>1. From the cau&s;es which produce it, acting upon the whole &s;y&s;tem.</Q></P>
<P N="13">XIII
<Q>2. From the &s;ymptoms of general debility which always precede the affection of the lungs. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are a quick pul&s;e, e&s;pecially towards evening; a heat and burning in the palms of the hands; faintne&s;s, head-ach, &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach, and an occa&s;ional diarrhoea. I have frequently ob&s;erved each of the&s;e &s;ymptoms for &s;everal months before I have heard of a &s;ingle complaint in the brea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P N="14">XIV.
<Q>3. From the pulmonary con&s;umption alternating with other di&s;ea&s;es which obviou&s;ly belong to the whole &s;y&s;tem. I &s;hall briefly men|tion the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</Q></P>
<P N="15">XV.
<Q>The rheumati&s;m. I have &s;een many ca&s;es in which this di&s;ea&s;e and the con&s;umption have alternately, in different &s;ea&s;ons or years, affected the &s;y&s;tem. In the winter of 1792, three clinical patients in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital exemplified by their complaints the truth of this ob&s;ervation. They were relieved &s;everal times of a cough by pains in their limbs, and as often, the pains in their limbs &s;eemed for a while to promi&s;e a cure to their pulmonic complaints.</Q></P>
<P N="16"><PB N="5" REF="030645_0010_0FE7EEFAAA3217F0">XVI.
<Q>The gout has often been ob&s;erved to alternate with the pulmonary con&s;umption e&s;pe|cially in per&s;ons in the decline of life. Dr. Sydenham de&s;cribes a &s;hort cough continuing through the whole winter, as a &s;ymptom of gouty habits. A gentleman from Virginia died under my care in the &s;pring of 1788, in the 45th year of his age, with all the &s;ymptoms of pulmonary con&s;umption, which had frequently alternated with pains and a &s;welling in his feet.</Q></P>
<P N="17">XVII.
<Q>The pulmonary con&s;umption has been ob&s;erved to alternate with madne&s;s. Of this I have &s;een two in&s;tances, in both of which, the cough, and expectoration were wholly &s;u&s;pended during the continuance of the derangement of the mind. Dr. Mead mentions a melancholy ca&s;e of the &s;ame kind in a young lady; and &s;imilar ca&s;es are to be met with in other authors. In all of them the di&s;ea&s;e proved fatal. In one of the ca&s;es which came under my notice, the &s;ymptoms of con&s;umption returned before the death of the patient.</Q></P>
<P N="18">XVIII.
<Q>I have likewi&s;e witne&s;&s;ed two ca&s;es in which the return of rea&s;on after madne&s;s, was &s;uddenly &s;ucceeded by a fatal pulmonary con|&s;umption. Perhaps the fal&s;e hopes, and even the cheerfulne&s;s which &s;o univer&s;ally occur in this di&s;order, may be re&s;olved into a morbid &s;tate of the mind, produced by a general derangement of the whole &s;y&s;tem. So univer&s;al are the delu&s;ion and hopes of patients with re&s;pect to the nature and i&s;&s;ue of this di&s;order, that I have never met with but one man, who, upon being a&s;ked what was the matter with him, an&s;wered unequivocally, 'that he was in a con&s;umption!'</Q></P>
<P N="19"><PB N="6" REF="030645_0011_0FE7EEFD625E2FF0">XIX.
<Q>Again. Dr. Bennet mentions a ca&s;e of 'a phthi&s;ical patient who was &s;eized with a violent pain in the teeth for two days, and in whom, during that time, every &s;ymptom of a con&s;umption, except the leanne&s;s of the body, altogether vani&s;hed;' and he adds further, 'that a defluxion on the lungs had often been relieved by &s;alivary evacuations.'</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Treati&s;e of the nature and cure of con&s;umptions&mdash; exercitation X.</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P N="20">XX.
<Q>I have &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances in which the pulmonary &s;ymptoms have alternated with head|ach and dy&s;pep&s;ia; al&s;o with pain and noi&s;e in one of the ears. This affection of the ears &s;ometimes continues throughout the whole di&s;ea&s;e without any remi&s;&s;ion of the pulmonary &s;ymptoms. I have &s;een one ca&s;e of a di&s;charge of matter from the left ear without being accompanied by either pain or noi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P N="21">XXI.
<Q>In all our books of medicine are to be found ca&s;es of con&s;umption alternating with eruptions on the &s;kin.</Q></P>
<P N="22">XXII.
<Q>And who has not &s;een the pulmonary &s;ymptoms alternately relieved, and reproduced by the appearance or ce&s;&s;ation of a diarrhoea, or pains in the bowels.</Q></P>
<P N="23">XXIII.
<Q>To the&s;e facts I &s;hall only add, un|der this head, as a proof of the con&s;umption being a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem, that it is always more or le&s;s relieved by the change which is induced in the &s;y&s;tem by pregnancy.</Q></P>
<P N="24">XXIV.
<Q>4. I infer that the pulmonary con|&s;umption is a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem from its
<PB N="7" REF="030645_0012_0FE7EF045E7B19C0">analogy with &s;everal other di&s;ea&s;es which, though accompanied by local affections, are obviou&s;ly produced by a morbid &s;tate of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</Q></P>
<P N="25">XXV.
<Q>The rheumati&s;m, the gout, the mea&s;les, &s;mall-pox, the different &s;pecies of cynanche; all furni&s;h examples of the connections of local affec|tions with a general di&s;ea&s;e; but the apoplexy, and the pneumony furni&s;h the mo&s;t &s;triking analogies of local affection, &s;ucceeding a general di&s;order of the &s;y&s;tem in the pulmonary con&s;ump|tion.</Q></P>
<P N="26">XXVI.
<Q>The mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of apoplexy is a general debility of the &s;y&s;tem, produced by intemperance in eating and drinking. The phae|nomena of the di&s;ea&s;e are produced by an effu&s;ion of blood or &s;erum, in con&s;equence of a morbid di&s;tention, or of a rupture of the ve&s;&s;els of the brain. The pulmonary con&s;umption begins and ends in the &s;ame way, allowing only for the differ|ence of &s;ituation and &s;tructure of the brain and lungs. After the production of predi&s;po&s;ing debility from the action of the remote cau&s;es formerly enumerated, the fluids are determined to the weake&s;t part of the body. Hence effu&s;ions of &s;erum or blood take place in the lungs. When &s;erum is effu&s;ed, a pituitous or purulent expora|tion alone takes place; when blood is di&s;charged, a di&s;ea&s;e is produced which has been called hae|mopty&s;is. An effu&s;ion of blood in the brain, brought on by the operation of general debility, has been called by Dr. Hoffman, with equal pro|priety, haermorrhage of the brain. The effu&s;ion of blood in the lungs in con&s;equence of the rup|ture of a blood ve&s;&s;el is le&s;s fatal than the &s;ame accident when it occurs in the brain, only becau&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="030645_0013_0FE7EF06076A21E0">the blood in the former ca&s;e is more ea&s;ily di&s;|charged from the &s;y&s;tem. Where no rupture of a blood ve&s;&s;el is produced, death is nearly as &s;peedy and certain in the one ca&s;e as in the other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>I have &s;een two ca&s;es of &s;udden death from he|mopty&s;is. In one of them there was very little blood di&s;charged through the mouth.</Q></P></NOTE> Di&s;|&s;ections &s;how many ca&s;es of &s;uffocation and death, from the lungs being preternaturally filled with blood or &s;erum. From this great analogy between the remote and proximate cau&s;es of the two di&s;|ea&s;es which have been de&s;cribed, I have taken the liberty to call them both by the name of apoplexy. The only &s;ymptom which does not accord with the derivation of the term, is, that in the apo|plexy of the lungs, the patient does not fall down as if by an external &s;troke which is mo&s;t frequently the ca&s;e in the apoplexy of the brain.</Q></P>
<P N="27">XXVII.
<Q>The hi&s;tory of the remote and proxi|mate cau&s;es of pneumony will furni&s;h us with a &s;till more remarkable analogy of the connection between a local affection, and a general di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;y&s;tem. The pneumony is produced by remote exciting cau&s;es, which act on the whole &s;y&s;tem. The whole arterial &s;y&s;tem is fre|quently agitated by a fever in this di&s;order before a pain is perceived in the brea&s;t or &s;ides, and this &s;ever generally con&s;titutes the &s;trength and danger of the di&s;ea&s;e. The expectoration which termi|nates the di&s;order in health, is always the effect of effu&s;ions produced by a general di&s;ea&s;e, and even the vomicas, which &s;ometimes &s;ucceed a deficiency of bleeding in this di&s;order, always depend upon the &s;ame general cau&s;e. From this view of the analogy between pneumony and pulmonary con&s;umption, it would &s;eem that the two di&s;ea&s;es differed from each other only by the &s;horter or
<PB N="9" REF="030645_0014_0FE7EF0AD3EE18B8">longer operation of the cau&s;es which induce them, and by the greater or le&s;s violence and duration of their &s;ymptoms. The pneumony appears to be an <HI>acute</HI> con&s;umption, and the con&s;umption a <HI>chronic</HI> pneumony. From the analogy of the pulmonary con&s;umption, with the diminutive term of certain fevers, I have taken the liberty of calling it a pneumonicula.</Q></P>

<Q>5. I infer that the pulmonary con|&s;umption is a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem, from its exi&s;tence without ulcers in the lungs. Of this there are many ca&s;es recorded in books of medicine.</Q></P>
<P N="29">XXIX.
<Q>Dr. Leigh informs us in his natural hi&s;tory of Lanca&s;hire, that the con&s;umption was a very common di&s;ea&s;e on the &s;ea coa&s;t of that country; but that it was not accompanied either by previous inflammation or ulcers in the lungs. It was generally attended, he &s;ays, by an unu&s;ual peevi&s;hne&s;s of temper.</Q></P>
<P N="30">XXX.
<Q>6. And la&s;tly, I infer, that the pulmo|nary con&s;umption is a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem, from its being relieved, or cured, only by reme|dies which act upon the whole &s;y&s;tem. This will appear, I hope, hereafter, when we come to treat of the cure of this di&s;order.</Q></P>
<P N="31">XXXI.
<Q>Let us now inquire how far the prin|ciples I have laid down will apply to the &s;uppo&s;ed proximate cau&s;es of con&s;umption. The&s;e cau&s;es have been &s;aid to be; an ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs, haemopty&s;is, tubercles, catarrh, hereditary dathe|&s;is, contagion, and the matter of cutaneous erup|tions or &s;ores repelled, and thrown upon the lungs. I &s;hall make a few ob&s;ervations upon each of them.</Q></P>
<P N="32"><PB N="10" REF="030645_0015_0FE7EF0D241D1630">XXXII.
<Q>1. An ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs is generally the con&s;equence of a neglected, or half cured pneumony. It is &s;eldom fatal, where it is not con|nected with a predi&s;po&s;ition to con&s;umption from general debility, or where general debility is not previou&s;ly induced by the want of appetite, &s;leep and exerci&s;e, which &s;ometimes accompanies that di&s;order of the lungs. This explination of the production of con&s;umption by an ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs, will receive further &s;upport from attending to the effects of wounds in the lungs. How &s;el|dom are they followed by pulmonary con&s;ump|tion; and this only becau&s;e they are as &s;eldom accompanied by predi&s;po&s;ing general debility. I do not recollect a &s;ingle in&s;tance of this di&s;order having followed a wound in the lungs, either by the bayonet, or a bullet, during the late war. The recoveries which have &s;ucceeded &s;uch wounds, and frequently under the mo&s;t unfavorable circum|&s;tances, &s;hew how very improbable it is that a much &s;lighter affection of the lungs &s;hould be|come the cau&s;e of a pulmonary con&s;umption.</Q></P>
<P N="33">XXXIII.
<Q>A Briti&s;h officer, whom I met in the Briti&s;h camp, a few days after the battle of Bran|dywine in September, 1777, informed me that the &s;urgeon general of the royal army had a&s;&s;ured him, that out of twenty-four &s;oldiers who had been admitted into the ho&s;pitals, during the cam|paign of 1776, with wounds in their lungs, twenty-three of them had recovered. Even pri|mary di&s;ea&s;es of the lungs often exi&s;t with peculiar violence, or continue for many years without in|ducing a con&s;umption. I have never known but one in&s;tance of the hooping cough ending in con&s;umption, and all our books of medicine con|tain records of the a&s;thma continuing for 20 and
<PB N="11" REF="030645_0016_0FE7EF12C3DB3690">30 years without terminating in that di&s;order. The rea&s;on in both ca&s;es, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to tho&s;e two original di&s;orders of the lungs not being ac|companied by general debility. One fact more will &s;erve to throw &s;till further light upon the &s;ubject. Millers are much afflicted with a cough from floating particles of flour con&s;tantly irritating their lungs and yet they are not more &s;ubject to con&s;umption than other laboring people. Hence `a miller's cough,' is proverbial in &s;ome places, to denote a cough of long continuance without danger.</Q></P>
<P N="34">XXXIV.
<Q>2. The haemopty&s;is is either a local di&s;ea&s;e, or it is the effect of general debility of the whole &s;y&s;tem. When it is local, or when it is the effect of cau&s;es which induce a <HI>temporary</HI> or <HI>acute</HI> debility only in the &s;y&s;tem, it is &s;eldom followed by con&s;umption. The accidental di&s;|charge of blood from the lungs, from injuries, and from an ob&s;truction of the men&s;es in women, is of this kind. Many per&s;ons are affected by this &s;pecies of haemorrhage once or twice in their lives, without &s;uffering any inconvenience from it afterwards. I have met with &s;everal ca&s;es in which it has occurred for many years every time the body was expo&s;ed to any of the cau&s;es which induce <HI>&s;udden,</HI> direct, or indirect debility, and yet no con&s;umption has followed it. The late king of Pru&s;&s;ia informed Dr. Zimmerman that he had been frequently attacked by it during his &s;even years war, and yet he lived notwith&s;tandng above twenty years afterwards without any pulmo|nary complaints. It is only in per&s;ons who labor under <HI>chronic</HI> debility, that an haemopty&s;is is ne|ce&s;&s;arily followed by con&s;umption.</Q></P>
<P N="35"><PB N="12" REF="030645_0017_0FE7EF152D186F00">XXXV.
<Q>3. I yield to the popular mode of expre&s;&s;ion when I &s;peak of a con&s;umption being produced by tubercles. But I maintain that they are the <HI>effects</HI> of general debility communicated to the bronchial ve&s;&s;els which cau&s;e them to effu&s;e a preternatural quantity of mucus. This mucus is &s;ometimes poured into the trachea from whence it is di&s;charged by hawking, more e&s;pecially in the morning; for it is effu&s;ed more copiou&s;ly during the languid hours of &s;leep than in the day time. But this mucus is frequently effu&s;ed into the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, where it produces tho&s;e tumours we call tubercles. When this occurs, there is either no cough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Med. Com. vol. 2.</NOTE> or a very dry one. That tubercles are formed in this way, I infer from the di&s;&s;ections and experiments of Dr. Stark<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Clinical and Anatomical Ob&s;ervations, p. 26, 27. See al&s;o Morgagni, letter xxii. 21.</NOTE> who tells us that he found them to con&s;i&s;t of inorganic matter that he was unable to di&s;cover any connection between them and the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els, by means of the micro&s;cope or injections, and that they fir&s;t opened into the trachea through the bron|chial ve&s;&s;els. It is remarkable that the color and con&s;i&s;tence of the matter of which they are com|po&s;ed, is nearly the &s;ame as the matter which is di&s;charged from the trachea, in the moi&s;t cough which occurs from a relaxation of the bronchial ve&s;&s;els.</Q></P>
<P N="36">XXXVI.
<Q>I am aware that the&s;e tumours in the lungs have been a&s;cribed to &s;cropula. But the frequent occurrence of con&s;umptions in per&s;ons in whom no &s;crophulous taint exi&s;ted, is &s;ufficient to refu&s;e this opinion. I have frequently directed
<PB N="13" REF="030645_0018_0FE7EF1C85E32FD8">my enquiries after this di&s;order in con&s;umptive patients, and have met with very few ca&s;es which were produced by it. It is probable that it may frequently be a predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e of con&s;umption in Great Britain, but I am &s;ure it is not in the United States of America.</Q></P>
<P N="37">XXXVII.
<Q>4. The catarrh is of two kind; acute and chronic, both of which are connected with general debility, but this debility is mo&s;t obvious in the chronic catarrh: hence we find it encrea&s;ed by every thing which acts upon the whole &s;y&s;tem, &s;uch as cold and damp weather, fatigue, and above all by old age, and relieved or cured by exerci&s;e, and every thing el&s;e which invigorates the whole &s;y&s;tem. This &s;pecies of catarrh often continues for twenty or thirty years without indu|cing pulmonary con&s;umption, in per&s;ons who pur&s;ue active occupations.</Q></P>
<P N="39">XXXIX
<Q>5. In the hereditary con&s;umption there is either an hereditary debility of the whole &s;y&s;tem, or an hereditary mal-conformation of the brea&s;t. In the latter ca&s;e, the con&s;umption is the effect of weakne&s;s communicated to the whole &s;y&s;tem, by the long continuance of difficult re&s;piration, or of &s;uch injuries being done to the lungs as are incompatible with health and life. It is remarkable, that the con&s;umptive diathe&s;is is more frequently derived from paternal than ma|ternal ance&s;tors.<NOTE PLACE="foot">[The reader will notice that the ob&s;ervations under figure 6 are here omitted&mdash;the &s;ubject of them was wholly on contagion, the particular quality or power of which can be known only by analogy of effects, and of cour&s;e no po&s;&s;itive inference could be drawn from it&mdash; the author has therefore pa&s;&s;ed them over as being of no u&s;e in his primary de&s;ign which is to e&s;tabli&s;h his theory upon known facts.]</NOTE></Q></P>

<Q>7. I grant that cutaneous humors, and the matter of old &s;ores, when repelled, or &s;uddenly healed, have in &s;ome ca&s;es fallen upon the lungs and produced con&s;umption. But I believe, in every ca&s;e where this has happened, the con&s;ump|tion was preceded by general debility, or that it was not induced, until the whole &s;y&s;tem had been previou&s;ly debilitated by a tedious and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cough.</Q></P>
<P N="41">XLI. Since my fir&s;t que&s;tion is &s;o fully an&s;wered by Dr. Ru&s;h, in the preceding paragraphs, I &s;hall pa&s;s to the next in order; viz. What is the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e or &s;tate of body producing the phe|nomena peculiar to it, &amp;c?</P>
<P N="42">XLII. Our &s;ure&s;t guide to this di&s;covery is, to take a view of the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es and their effects on the human frame. As they all clearly appear from Dr. Ru&s;h's ob&s;ervations, to be powers inducing debility in the &s;y&s;tem either by their direct or indirect operation, the inference is plain and ea&s;y; viz. That the derangements we experience in the con&s;umption, by which our bodies are wa&s;ted and finally de&s;troyed is the re&s;ult of defect of power or want of energy in the &s;everal functions of the &s;y&s;tem. The an&s;wer to the remaining part of the que&s;tion is &s;o fully involved in what has been &s;aid, that no further notice need be taken of it: for <HI>debil|ity</HI> is nothing more, nor le&s;s, nor a&s;ide of <HI>debility</HI> from whatever &s;ource it is produced; whither by powers ab&s;tracting from, or adding too much &s;timulus to the &s;y&s;tem.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While this is the ca&s;e no diver&s;ity of &s;pecies can be rationally conceived of.</NOTE></P>
<P>The la&s;t query, viz. How many &s;pecies and their different cau&s;es and natures, al&s;o naturally loo&s;es
<PB N="15" REF="030645_0020_0FE8448A44771CB8">its exi&s;tence. So that it would now &s;eem that no|thing remained but to devi&s;e a proper method to re&s;tore the energy of the &s;everal functions, by coun|teracting the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es, or in other words, a proper method of cure.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. But alas! &s;uch is the power of tradition, &s;uch the veneration for the opinions of men of medi|cal fame, that a tonic or &s;thenic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Active&mdash;oppo&s;ed to weak and indolent.</NOTE> inflammatory con|&s;umption, is &s;till warmly contended for. Even the great Dr. Ru&s;h, (who&s;e ideas in other re&s;pects are worthy the exalted character he &s;u&s;tains) is upon the li&s;t of its &s;upporters. As this opinion has &s;till &s;o many advocates, &s;ome of whom are men of influ|ence, humanity impels me to attempt its refutation. I &s;hall therefore proceed to examine the &s;everal phenomena, &amp;c. on which they found their argu|ments; and by a careful and candid inve&s;tigation endeavour to &s;hew, that by the laws of animal nature there is no foundation in any of them for &s;uch a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t take notice of an argument made u&s;e of to &s;upport the doctrine of inflammatory or tonic con&s;umption; viz. That debility even tho' it be chronic and habitual predi&s;po&s;es to inflammatory diathe&s;is. See Dr. Ru&s;h's medical inquiries, vol. 2, page 116, where &s;peaking of blood letting in the con&s;umption, he &s;ays,
<Q>It may &s;eem &s;trange to re|commend this debilitating remedy in a di&s;ea&s;e brought on by debility. Were it proper in this place I could prove that there is no di&s;ea&s;e in which bleeding is pre&s;cribed, which is not induced by predi&s;po&s;ing debility in common with pulmona|ry con&s;umption. I &s;hall only remark here, that in con&s;equence of the exciting cau&s;e acting on the
<PB N="16" REF="030645_0021_0FE8448ED105ECE8" MS="y">&s;y&s;tem (rendered extremely excitable by debility) &s;uch a morbid and exce&s;&s;ive excitement is produ|ced in the arteries, as to render a diminution of the &s;timulus of the blood ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to reduce it.</Q>
This is followed by two ca&s;es to con|firm the doctrine, in one of which he bled fifteen times in &s;ix weeks, and the other eight times in two weeks: in the la&s;t it is added with happy effects. But he does not give us any particular &s;tatement of the&s;e ca&s;es;; &s;o that we may at lea&s;t conjecture that the Doctor might be mi&s;taken in giving tho&s;e ca&s;es the appellation of con&s;umption or phthi&s;is pul|monalis. After reading this paragraph, I turned back to paragraph VII, to &s;ee what this `exciting cau&s;e' &s;hould be? But on an attentive peru&s;al I could find nothing in that nor in the predi&s;po&s;ing or remote cau&s;es. See par. VI, (which the Dr. &s;ays may operate as exciting) which could not produce &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive excitement in the arterial &s;y&s;tem; nor in fact <HI>any</HI> (which operate by a direct agency) except the alternation of heat and cold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">It mu&s;t be always confe&s;&s;ed that when the excitability is accumulated by cold, the &s;timulus of heat acts with en|crea&s;ed force on our &s;y&s;tem.</NOTE>. And in|deed many of them there enumerated; viz.
<Q>Grief and other debilitating pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, hypo|chondria&s;is, improper lactation, exce&s;&s;ive evacua|tion of all kinds, e&s;pecially by &s;tool, cold damp air, &amp;c.</Q>
would lead the mind to a very different conclu&s;ion. But waving this &s;eeming impropriety by &s;uppo&s;ing we may mi&s;take the Doctor's meaning (which is very po&s;&s;ible) and admit that he does not mean to confine our attention to the paragraphs alluded to, but to <HI>any</HI> &s;trong &s;timulus or exciting power: yet even in this view another difficulty will ari&s;e of equal magnitude, &s;ince we may not he&s;itate to declare that every exciting cau&s;e or power invari|ably
<PB N="17" REF="030645_0022_0FE8449054CD1A90">counteracts debility, and of cour&s;e is ju&s;tly adapted (when properly bounded) to prevent the progre&s;s of that chronic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the debility is of this kind, which brings on or produces the derangements peculiar to the con&s;umption and is that kind our author means to refer us to in the pa&s;&s;age quoted from the 116th page of his 2d vol.

<Q>I met with one ca&s;e only in which, contrary to my <HI>expectation,</HI> the patient <HI>mended</HI> after an attack of acute inflammation of the lungs, &s;o as to live two years.</Q>
Another fact mu&s;t equally &s;erve to con|firm my propo&s;ition, mentioned by Dr. Ru&s;h, and al&s;o by Dr. Cullin. The latter &s;ays, vol. 2, page 415.
<Q>The pregnancy of women has often retarded the progre&s;s or a phthi&s;is; but commonly it is only until after delivery when the &s;ymptoms of phthi&s;is return with violence and &s;oon prove fatal.</Q>

For we ob&s;erve in pregnancy, that the &s;ubject, after recovering from tho&s;e complaints pe|culiar to the fir&s;t months, to grow fle&s;hy, and in many in&s;tances &s;o &s;thenic as to require repeated blood let|ting: but directly after delivery their ca&s;es in gen|eral are rever&s;ed; fir&s;t by lochial evacuation, and af|terward by lactation.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. `Again, our author (Dr. Ru&s;h) page 112, when &s;peaking of the analogy between the pneumonia and con&s;umption, &s;ays,

This <HI>relaxed &s;tate of the lungs,</HI> (which according to the Doctor's general propo&s;i|tion, &s;ee paragraphs V &amp; XI, is in common with the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem, (tho' the diathe&s;is in the lungs is &s;omewhat the greate&s;t and fully accords with his theory of predi&s;po&s;ition,) is an indi&s;po&s;ition, which to remove, rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts, that the agency of tho&s;e very powers (properly regulated) which natural|ly generate pneumoniac inflammation is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and this is notably confirmed by the two facts la&s;t related in par. XLIII, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t, to which may be added the great benefit patients of this de&s;cription derive from the u&s;e of &s;timulant and tonic remedies. This &s;ugge&s;tion is further &s;uppor|ted by the utility experienced in that relaxation in the genitals, occa&s;ioned by long continued gonorr|heas, by adding cantharides to the medicines u&s;ually employed; which, when given in any con&s;iderable
<PB N="19" REF="030645_0024_0FE84497B2AB5810">quantities do in fact excite inflammation in tho&s;e particular parts.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. Be&s;ides, we have great rea&s;on to doubt, whether an inflammation of any con&s;iderable duration, can exi&s;t in &s;uch a &s;tate of chronic debility; on account of the weak un&s;table &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem in all &s;uch ca&s;es: much le&s;s to conceive of one of <HI>&s;ix,</HI> or even of <HI>two</HI> weeks &s;tanding. And this doubt is increa&s;ed by the Dr. him&s;elf in what he &s;ays in the volume alluded to, &s;ee page 185, where &s;pea|king of drop&s;ies he &s;ays,
<Q>It is probable that the &s;ame difference &s;hould be ob&s;erved, between the treatment of drop&s;ies, in warm and cold climates, that is ob&s;erved in the treatment of inflammatory fevers.</Q>

<Q>The tonic action probably exi&s;ts in the &s;y&s;tem in both climates; in the former it re&s;embles the tides which are &s;ud|denly produced by a &s;hower of rain, and as &s;ud|denly di&s;appear; whereas in the latter, it may be compared to tho&s;e tides which are produced by the &s;low and gradual addition of water from nu|merous &s;treams, which continue for days and weeks together to exhibit marks of violence, in every part of their cour&s;e.</Q>
Here a query natu|rally &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf, whether there is, or can be any difference between a habit debilited by the powers enumerated in the former part of this work, or one induced by living in or near the torrid Zone? Whether they will not alike &s;ubject the &s;y&s;tem to tho&s;e &s;udden changes on the application or ab&s;trac|tion of &s;timuli which form &s;uch a di&s;parity between the latter, and the more permanent habits of the nothern latitudes?</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. But what could be the complaint for which the Dr. continued to bleed for &s;ix weeks, un|til
<PB N="20" REF="030645_0025_0FE8449EDABDC788">he had bled fifteen times? And of the one for which he bled eight times in two weeks? The latter he &s;peaks of as being `attended with the happie&s;t effects.' To this I an&s;wer.

But if &s;uch &s;timulus or &s;thenic power be applied more moderately, by its le&s;s violent operation on &s;uch permanent habit it may continue a con&s;iderable time (&s;ay &s;ix weeks) producing <HI>catarrh's,</HI> &amp;c. with|out inducing indirect debility; and repeated bleed|ing,

On the other hand, rea&s;on, experience and the remarks of the Doctor him&s;elf in the pa&s;&s;age la&s;t quoted all con&s;pire, to determine what would be the &s;ituation of the a&s;|thenic<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Defect of, or want of energy.</NOTE> infirm, or chronic debilitated &s;ubject, under &s;uch alternate expo&s;ures.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. Having fini&s;hed the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k of animadverting on the arguments of &s;o learned and re&s;pectable a writer as Dr. Ru&s;h, I &s;hall now proceed to examine &s;ome of the principal phenom|ena, on which the contenders for a tonic inflammatory con&s;umption found their arguments. The&s;e are,</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. 1&s;t. That copious bleedings, in ca&s;es of hoemoptoe's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An effu&s;ion of blood from the lungs.</NOTE> are le&s;s frequently followed by pul|moniac complaints than the le&s;s profu&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The occurrence of a hard pul&s;e in the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The expectoration of purulent matter in the di&s;order, &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that which is rai&s;ed in the breaking of an ulcer or ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The &s;uppo&s;ed benefit of blood letting, and frequent relief produced by it.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. In reply to the fir&s;t; viz. `That copious bleedings, &amp;c. I &s;hall advert in the fir&s;t place to the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e profu&s;e bleedings at the lungs which take place previous to any pulmo|niac complaints. Here we &s;hall find they gene|rally, if not always happen in con&s;equence of &s;ome accident which has befallen the patient otherwi&s;e in health. Dr. Boarhaave, if I rightly remember, lays
<PB N="22" REF="030645_0027_0FE844A7B4A1D0E0">much, if not his whole &s;tre&s;s on the ca&s;e of a man who bled profu&s;ely on being violently thrown out of a carriage; who, being much neglected as to any kind of &s;timulants, recovered without any pulmoniac complaints. On the other hand tho&s;e &s;maller blee|dings we find which are followed by pulmoniac complaints, <HI>generally</HI> if not <HI>always</HI> attend people la|boring under chronic debility.</P>
<P N="50">L. By attending to the&s;e remarks, and com|paring them with Dr. Ru&s;h's ob&s;ervations, &s;ee para|graph XXXIV, we &s;hall be led to conclude that in the ca&s;es of the fir&s;t de&s;cription, it was the previous vigor and health of the &s;ubject which pre&s;erved the patient from future evil con&s;equences, and that the <HI>wound</HI> made of &s;o much con&s;equence in either ca&s;e could not be worthy our attention; this is fully evinced, not only from what is there &s;aid, but by adverting to the frequent bleedings at the no&s;e and fauces which take place without being followed with the &s;lighte&s;t traces of inflammation.</P>
<P N="51">LI. Hence the attentive enquirer would be ready to wonder if haemorrhages under &s;uch circum&s;tances are &s;o &s;afe, from whence came the idle whim of following them with repeated bleedings, which would land the patient in a chronic debility, a &s;tate wherein (to u&s;e the Doctors own words,)
<Q>haemopty&s;is is ne|ce&s;&s;arily followed by a con&s;umption,</Q>
he would like|wi&s;e be equally &s;urpri&s;ed to hear &s;uch phaenomina made u&s;e of as an argument to &s;upport the idea of an inflammatory or &s;thenic con&s;umption. Nay he would be naturally led to con&s;ider the latter bleedings (the &s;mall or le&s;s profu&s;e) as &s;ymptoms of the weak patulus, and irritable &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els, rather than a di&s;ea&s;e or its origin; and be confirmed in the opinion when he reflected on the material
<PB N="23" REF="030645_0028_0FE844A93957AC18">benefits experienced from the u&s;e of the bark and other tonic remedies to remove it.</P>
<P N="52">LII. I &s;hall clo&s;e my di&s;&s;ertation on this head by noticing a clau&s;e in Dr. Barry's treati&s;e on the con|&s;umption, publi&s;hed in the year 1727, page 226, where he gives it as his decided opinion, that the &s;low &s;mall bleedings proceed from the bronchial arteries. Admitting this to be the ca&s;e, which from the peculiar weakne&s;s experienced at the brea&s;t immediately after &s;uch bleedings we are di&s;po&s;ed to believe, we &s;hall readily conjecture why &s;uch patients &s;hould be liable to pulmoniac complaints, on account of the debilitating effects, the lo&s;s of blood from this artery mu&s;t have on the lungs: as it is pretty evident that from the&s;e arteries the lungs derive their entire &s;upport, the pulmonary arteries being de&s;tined for another purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. The next &s;ubject under con&s;ideration is the occurrence of a hard pul&s;e in con&s;umptive di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t always appear a paradox in nature to &s;uppo&s;e a tonic, or &s;thenic &s;tate of the arteries, while the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem is wa&s;teing away thro' debility or want of energy: but that a hard pul&s;e which has been generally con&s;idered as a pathog|nomonic &s;ign of &s;thenic or tonic energy, does &s;ome|times occur in the con&s;umption we mu&s;t believe, unle&s;s we di&s;pute the veracity of Dr. Ru&s;h, even when the principles of life and animation have nearly cea&s;ed. He &s;ays in page 111,
<Q>I have &s;een two ca&s;es in which a hard pul&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms of inflammatory action appeared in the la&s;t hours of life.</Q>
We may ea&s;ily &s;urmount this difficulty, by attending to the effects of irritating
<PB N="24" REF="030645_0029_0FE844B15FAC0070">powers on debilitated habits, which exhibit that fal&s;e appearance of &s;trength and vigor through the &s;y&s;tem &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly ob&s;ervable on the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;pa&s;ms, or &s;udden derangements of the mental functions. I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that I have my&s;elf experienced &s;everal in&s;tances where the phenomena appeared in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, in debilitated &s;ubjects labouring under &s;pa&s;ms or other &s;trong irritations, even to &s;uch a degree as to beget a doubt, whether I had not mi&s;taken the cau&s;e: but on the application of <HI>&s;timulants,</HI> the perterbation &s;ub&s;ided and the pul&s;e &s;oftened. In this way only I can account for an expre&s;&s;ion in the new Edin|burgh Di&s;pen&s;atory, where &s;peaking of the effects of opium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Opium is now generally allowed to rank among the highe&s;t &s;timulants.</NOTE>, it is &s;aid
<Q>the action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem is dimini&s;hed, the pul&s;e for the mo&s;t part <HI>&s;ofter,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
Coincident with the above, I would beg leave to in&s;ert an extract from a paper publi&s;h|ed in the New-London Medical Journal for 1792, page 33, communicated by Mr. Stringer, Surgeon, Riegate in Surry; which is as follows.</P>
<P>`RIEGATE, <HI>November</HI> 31&s;t, 1791.</P>
<P N="54">LIV.
<Q>The term inflammation appears to me to admit of a greater extent and divi&s;ion than is generally allowed. In particular that &s;ufficient &s;tre&s;s is not laid between the inflammatory diathe|&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem, and local inflammation ari&s;ing from irritability occa&s;ioning &s;pa&s;ms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That inflammation is found to exi&s;t in relaxed debilitated habits, excited and kept up by irrita|tion of &s;ome peculiar acrimony, totally contrary and independent of any inflammatory diathe&s;is,
<PB N="25" REF="030645_0030_0FE844B45EF9F650">as in &s;crophula, veneria, &amp;c. will not be denied: and that pleuritic and peripneumoniac &s;ymptoms frequently ari&s;e in debilitated habits from irrita|tions and &s;pa&s;ms independent of any general inflammation, &s;eems to me evident, from particu|lar ob&s;ervations and the &s;ucce&s;s of a contrary mode of treatment to that generally adopted in the cure of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</Q></P>
<P N="55">LV.
<Q>In a general inflammatory affection, the pathognomoniac &s;ymptoms do not always imme|diately occur, for in &s;ome in&s;tances the action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem is retarded; giving a week, &s;oft, and &s;ometimes a trembling and intermitting pul&s;e. In this ca&s;e, upon opening the vein, the circula|tion is rai&s;ed, the pul&s;e becomes full and hard, the blood &s;izy, and all &s;ymptoms of true and active inflammation appear. This is frequently the ca&s;e on the fir&s;t attack of an inflammatory fever, ari&s;ing from the violence of the action exci|ting a compre&s;&s;ion upon the arterial &s;y&s;tem, this compre&s;&s;ion being removed either by natural, or atificial means the &s;ymptoms of encrea&s;ed arterial action become evident.</Q></P>
<P N="56">LVI.
<Q>On the contrary, the action of the heart and arteries, from &s;ome tempory exciting cau&s;e, is frequently increa&s;ed under circum&s;tances of general debility in the habit. Pleuritic peripneu|moniac, and other inflammatory &s;ymptoms, often taken place under the&s;e circum&s;tances, where profu&s;e evacuations, if they do not occa&s;ion imme|diate mi&s;chief, commonly lay a foundation for future evils. I am afraid there is rea&s;on to doubt that the phthi&s;is pulmonalis has been frequently brought on by to free a u&s;e of the lancet, and other evacuants. If the lungs <HI>e&s;cape,</HI> a terrible train of nervous afflictions is the con&s;equence.</Q></P>
<P N="57"><PB N="26" REF="030645_0031_0FE844BBA545DAD8">LVII.
<Q>Vene&s;ection is too &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on and too frequently repeated at a time when opiates with or without other anti&s;pa&s;modics, by allaying the irritation, and &s;pa&s;ms (which is often the only remaining cau&s;e of inflammatory &s;ymp|toms, even after frequent bleedings have been had recour&s;e to) would more &s;peedily relieve the pre|&s;ent &s;ymptoms, prevent the ill con&s;equences of too great a deprivation of the vital fluid, and give room for further ob&s;ervation on the &s;ub&s;equent treatment of the di&s;ea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P N="58">LVIII.
<Q>I have had frequent occa&s;ions to ob|&s;erve the good tendency of this practice, and with difference to &s;uperior judgement, cannot help wi&s;hing to lay peculiar &s;tre&s;s on the efficacy of anodynes and anti&s;pa&s;modics, in many ca&s;es of thoracic inflammation, a proof that irritation and &s;pa&s;ms are frequently the exciting cau&s;e particu|larly in debilitated habits; even in plethoric habits, &s;pa&s;ms may be only remaining cau&s;e of the &s;ymptoms &s;till exi&s;ting as &s;trong as ever, even af|ter the mo&s;t liberal u&s;e of the lancet, as &s;eems to be evinced by the following</Q></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE.</HEAD>
<P N="59">LIX.
<Q>I was de&s;ired to &s;ee a man who had hung him&s;elf with a handkerchief, and was a &s;hort time after cut down. He appeared to be middle aged, healthy, mu&s;cular and &s;trong. His eyes were fixed, his teeth fa&s;t &s;hut, and he foamed at the mouth like a per&s;on dying, from compre&s;&s;ion, or concu&s;&s;ion of the brain, his pul&s;e hard, &s;trong, and full.</Q></P>
<P N="60">LX.
<Q>I he&s;itated not, but for expedition &s;ake, cut off his coat and pierced a vein in each arm
<PB N="27" REF="030645_0032_0FE844BD2B0A18D0">from which his pul&s;e not flagging in the lea&s;t, about two pounds of blood were drawn, as nearly as could be a&s;certained from the confu&s;ion in the place.</Q></P>
<P N="61">LXI.
<Q>He did not appear to be the lea&s;t reliev|ed, on the contrary the &s;pa&s;ms became general and it required the &s;trength of &s;everal per&s;ons to hold him; the blood flowed from the orifices in the arms at every contraction of the mu&s;cles with vi|olence that could only be equalled by the punc|ture of a large antery and could not be re&s;trained either by pre&s;&s;ure, bandage, or compre&s;s; I began to think that either &s;ome of the ve&s;&s;els in the head had been bur&s;t by the compre&s;ion of the handker|chief on the neck, or that con&s;iderable injury had been done to the head from the fall in cutting down, tho' there was no external appearance of it.</Q></P>
<P N="62">LXII.
<Q>The man appearing to be &s;till getting wor&s;e, and no pro&s;pect of benefit ari&s;ing from further bleeding, I was induced to try whether &s;pa&s;ms alone might not be the pre&s;ent cau&s;e of derangement in the cen&s;orium, for which purpo&s;e he was forced to &s;wallow fifty drops of tincture of opium. This &s;peedily had the de&s;ired effect of le&s;&s;ening the di&s;turbance in the whole &s;y&s;tem; he grew quiet and do&s;ed an hour or two, when the convul&s;ions threatening to return, the opiate was repeated with the &s;ame good effects as before, till he took near two hundred drops in the &s;pace of fourteen hours, which in the end threw him into a &s;ound &s;leep, and he awoke perfectly in his &s;en&s;es, tho a &s;light mania attacked him a few days afterwards, which left him by the u&s;e of proper evacuations.</Q></P>
<P N="63"><PB N="28" REF="030645_0033_0FE844C2EB0C5320">LXIII. The expectoration of purulent matter in the di&s;order, comes next to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This appears to be an argument made u&s;e of in favor of a &s;thenic, inflammatory con&s;umption, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that it ari&s;es from the &s;ame origin as a vomica, and is con&s;idered as an open ulcer of the lungs: hence the idea of inflammatory and &s;upura|tive &s;tages of the con&s;umption; conceiving mean time of no other inflammation but a &s;thenic or tonic one, and frequent bleedings have been urged to prevent the &s;econd or &s;upurative &s;tage.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. That this is not the ca&s;e mu&s;t appear evident, not only by con&s;idering that all the predi&s;|po&s;ing cau&s;es are &s;uch as indicate atonia in the &s;y&s;tem; but by reflecting that this is frequently, if not always preceded by an expectoration of vicid mucus from the glands, or ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, and &s;ometimes in con&s;iderable quantities, plainly indica|ting, that tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, in&s;tead of being in a &s;tate of tonic inflammation, are become weak and patulus.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. The la&s;t argument I &s;hall notice, which is u&s;ed to &s;upport the idea of an inflammatory tonic con&s;umption, is `the &s;uppo&s;ed benefit of blood letting, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ed I call it, for I cannot conceive any foundation for it in nature: for in ca&s;es of pluiri&s;y, peripneumony, &amp;c. where rea&s;on and long experi|ence evince the great utility of blood letting; we find that purging, &s;weating, and indeed every evac|uation which &s;erves in a mea&s;ure to empty the ve&s;&s;els, operate in common with bleeding, to render the pul&s;e &s;lower, abate the thir&s;t, cool the body, and not only ca&s;e the di&s;tre&s;s, but make the patient feel
<PB N="29" REF="030645_0034_0FE844C46EF4CC38">more vigorous, and approach nearer health. Is this the ca&s;e in the con&s;umption? Does not &s;weat|ing, purging and every other natural evacuation, ultimately quicken the pul&s;e, increa&s;e the thir&s;t and fever? And although they may for the pre&s;ent abate &s;ome di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom, yet the debility (which appears in fact to be the di&s;ea&s;e) is felt by the patient to increa&s;e; and in&s;tead of returning health, the marks of di&s;&s;olution are more &s;trikingly painted. That this is the ca&s;e I believe every experienced practitioner will admit. The que&s;tion then mu&s;t be, if every other evacuation, which empties the ve&s;&s;els and debilitates the &s;y&s;tem, &s;o u&s;eful in truly tonic and &s;thenic ca&s;es, is &s;o injurious in the con&s;umption, why not bleeding al&s;o? This idea is further corro|borated by reverting to the effects of pregnancy, (&s;ee paragraph XLIII) where we &s;ee that even a natural &s;uppre&s;&s;ion or ce&s;&s;ation of the cu&s;tomary evacuation of the blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be &s;aid that the blood taken up to nouri&s;h the foetus fully compen&s;ates for the retention of the blood, &amp;c. but if &s;o, why the &s;o frequent nece&s;&s;ity of bleeding in tho&s;e ca&s;es?</NOTE> has retarded the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. I will readily admit that bleeding frequently affords relief from the &s;pa&s;ms, &amp;c. about the brea&s;t; and &s;o will a diarrhoea or pain in the bowels, (&s;ee paragraph XXII.) I have my&s;elf been lately a witne&s;s of the fatal effects of even a moderate attack of a dy&s;&s;entery in the di&s;order; which did indeed greatly relieve the brea&s;t of my patient, but increa&s;|ed the di&s;ea&s;e even to a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution. That &s;pa&s;ms and the pain and unea&s;ine&s;s re&s;ulting from them may give way to any thing that effects any con&s;iderable revolution or diver&s;ion in the &s;y&s;tem, is too evident to need other te&s;timony than experi|ence. But as a fact, with &s;ome ob&s;ervations, con|&s;onant to the foregoing, now lies before me, I &s;hall take the liberty to in&s;ert it. The author &s;peaks as
<PB N="30" REF="030645_0035_0FE844CBCB540258">follows.
<Q>A certain gentleman in his de&s;k, &s;peak|ing of the method of curing apilep&s;y or the falling &s;ickne&s;s, and recommending among other evacu|ent and otherwi&s;e debilitating means, &s;mall but frequently repeated bleedings, unguardedly con|tradicts him&s;elf in his very next &s;entence.
<Q>How|ever,</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q>we regular practitioners are liable to be too cautious and even timid &s;ometimes. For I have known a bold practitioner in the country, who cured an epilep&s;y by very profu&s;e bleeding. A few months after the patient died of a univer&s;al drop&s;y, but the epilep&s;y never returned.</Q>
I would a&s;k this gentleman, what &s;ort of a cure that was, which, converted a di&s;ea&s;e, which may come and go for many years, nay even for a long life time into one that in a very &s;hort time proved fatal? What rea&s;on would a podagric have to thank any one, who &s;hould convert the gout in him upon any violent attack, into a fatal drop&s;y? That &s;ort of treatment is not curing a di&s;ea&s;e but encrea&s;ing it, and even that to death. The convul&s;ive &s;ymptoms of an a&s;thenia may pa&s;s away; but the a&s;thenia remains, you may cea&s;e to call it epilep&s;y; but drop&s;y &s;till &s;hows that the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e remains, nay is prodigiou&s;ly encrea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P N="66">LXVI. In making the&s;e remarks on bleeding in the con&s;umption, I would not wi&s;h to have them applied to every ca&s;e of predi&s;po&s;ition, &s;ince it is evident it is &s;ometimes u&s;hered on by indirect debili|tating powers. In this ca&s;e, in the early &s;tage of the predi&s;po&s;ition bleeding may be of &s;ervice by le&s;&s;ening in a degree the morbid exce&s;&s;ive excite|ment. But this ought to be before that degree of debility is induced which con&s;titutes the di&s;ea&s;e; and is never to be performed after that degree of
<PB N="31" REF="030645_0036_0FE844CD4F0CE7C0">weakne&s;s is induced wherein the excitability does not readily accumulate upon &s;uch ab&s;traction, and the patient, in&s;tead of being thereby weakened, &s;hall feel more vigorous.</P>
<P N="67">LXVII. From the foregoing ob&s;ervations, I think it mu&s;t appear, that the theoretical rea&s;onings made u&s;e of to reconcile the idea, that chronic de|bility is or may be the predi&s;po&s;ing proximate or exciting cau&s;e of a tonic inflammatory diathe&s;is; and the inferences drawn from the various phenom|ena therein mentioned, are all the product of a mi&s;guided imagination and have no real foundation in nature. And we are after all left to conclude that tho&s;e powers which induce debility, produce tho&s;e derangements, con&s;equent, or re&s;ulting from debility. Hence a rational mode of cure immedi|ately &s;trikes the mind; viz. The application of &s;timu|lant and tonic remedies (properly regulated) in order to counteract the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es, and re&s;tore the lo&s;t vigor and energy to the &s;y&s;tem. The ju&s;tne&s;s of this idea is abundantly proved by facts recorded in medical hi&s;tory, within the&s;e few years pa&s;t, e&s;pecially &s;ince the ingenious Dr. May has pre&s;umed to doubt the rationality of the former theory of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;tep a&s;ide from the old track of pre&s;criptions and adopt the above method of cure, (&s;ee his papers publi&s;hed in the London Medical Journal, vol. IX, page 286) the &s;ucce&s;s of his practice has emboldened him and others to per&s;evere in the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, and, with the happie&s;t effects. See a paper from Dr. Percival of Man|che&s;ter (England) publi&s;hed in Memoirs of London Medical Society, vol. II. A &s;econd paper from Dr. May, publi&s;hed in London Medical Journal, vol. XI, page 255. One al&s;o from Edmond Pitts Gapper, Surgeon at Mere in Wilt&s;hire, publi&s;hed
<PB N="32" REF="030645_0037_0FE844D4A38CE420">in &s;aid Journal, vol. XI, page 388; and likewi&s;e one from A. Lawrence, publi&s;hed in the New London Medical Journal, vol. II, page 288, all fraught with facts illu&s;trating the utility of &s;uch a mode of prac|tice, to which many more might be added which have occurred in this country. But as I have neither lei&s;ure to collect, nor room to in&s;ert them in the narrow limits I have pre&s;cribed to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s them over and proceed from this general indication, to a more particular method of cure.</P>
<P N="68">LXVIII. As has been before ob&s;erved, this di&s;ea&s;e, or more properly &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem may be induced by two very oppo&s;ite powers; viz. <HI>Direct</HI> and <HI>indirect</HI> debilitating; and altho' they both ter|minate in the reduction of the &s;y&s;tem to &s;uch degree of imbecility as to produce all the phenomena which con&s;titute or characteri&s;e a con&s;umption; &s;ome dif|ference of application may however be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to obviate the agency of tho&s;e powers and re|&s;tore the &s;y&s;tem.

Before I proceed I would beg leave for the illu&s;tration of what is now before us, to point the reader to an evident law of nature which may be daily ob&s;erved, in which both &s;pecies of debility are &s;trikingly laid open to our view; and which may not only &s;erve as a clue to the more ju&s;t application of remedies, but likewi&s;e throw &s;ome further light on the preceding part of this work.</P>
<P N="70">LXX. The law of nature I would here allude to
<PB N="33" REF="030645_0038_0FE844D6285EAFB0" MS="y">is that debility nece&s;&s;arily connected with childhood and old age: the fir&s;t termed direct, the la&s;t indirect.

That they are alike liable to indirect debility from a too great applica|tion of &s;timuli, and &s;o vice ver&s;e. And tho' they each may have their excitability daily kept reduced to a healthy &s;tandard by &s;timuli, it is al&s;o evident that by this very means the excitability is con&s;tantly acquiring additional vigor or permanency, requiring &s;tronger and &s;tronger &s;timuli to reduce it, until a certain degree of firmne&s;s is e&s;tabli&s;hed which con|&s;titutes

<P N="73">LXXIII. The utility of exerci&s;e is made notably evident from facts recorded in medical hi&s;tory, not only in per&s;ons who have voluntarily engaged in it, but in many who have been compelled of nece&s;&s;ity vigorou&s;ly to u&s;e it for a length of time, both in con&s;umptive complaints, and other derangements from debility. And not only facts, but the laws of animal nature in&s;truct us that exerci&s;e not only gives excitement to the whole frame, and encrea&s;es the appetite; but likewi&s;e promotes a&s;&s;imilation and dige&s;tion in every part of the &s;y&s;tem de&s;tined to perform tho&s;e functions; it increa&s;es the action and power of the ve&s;&s;els in the remote parts of the body, whereby more exerementitious matter is thrown off through the external and remote ve&s;&s;els<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The utility of this effect receives confirmation from paragraph XL.</NOTE>, and of cour&s;e the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs are le&s;s bur|thened.</P>
<P N="74"><PB N="35" REF="030645_0040_0FE844E02E1414E0">LXXIV. But this like all other &s;timulating agents, ought to be as exactly adapted to the &s;tate of debility in the patient as po&s;&s;ible. It ought to be vigorous enough on the one hand to produce a &s;ufficient degree of excitement thro' the &s;y&s;tem; to reduce the excitability to a healthy point or &s;tandard; to be encrea&s;ed as &s;trength and permanency encrea|&s;es; for rea&s;ons mentioned in paragraph LXXI. And on the other hand, it ought always to be &s;o carefully bounded that the patient may endure it mo&s;t of his waking hours without endangering indi|rect debility. The mode of it ought to be &s;o con|trived as to produce le&s;s excitement on the lungs, than in any other given part of the &s;y&s;tem; for as in this di&s;ea&s;e the diathe&s;is is greater in them, than in the re&s;t of the body, it is evident they may more ea&s;ily be overcome, or thrown into a &s;tate of indi|rect debility, (hence the impropriety of walking, e&s;pecially up hill or up &s;tairs, and &s;peaking long &s;entences with a rai&s;ed tone of voice,) before &s;uffi|cient excitement is given to the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem. Be&s;ides, the cough (tho' induced by direct debilita|ting powers) is every day more <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> than is any way nece&s;&s;ary for the lungs and naturally tends to increa&s;e the diathe&s;is, by adding indirect to direct debility.</P>

<HEAD>REGIMEN.</HEAD>
<P N="75">LXXV. Various articles of diet have been re|commended as &s;alutary in con&s;umptive ca&s;es, &s;uch as milk from various animals, (which has been extolled almo&s;t as a &s;pecific) ripe fruits, &s;uch as grapes, oranges,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Before we ha&s;tily determine on the &s;pecific quality of any article of diet in any particular complaint, we ought not only to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the excitability, (of which hereafter in the text) but the place of re&s;i|dence, &s;ex, age, &s;ea&s;on of the year when made u&s;e of, habit, and inclination or ta&s;te of the &s;ubject on whom the &s;alutary effects are experienced.</P>
<P>Dr. More, in a letter to a friend, publi&s;hed in his travels relates two ca&s;es, who mended much on the u&s;e of ripe grapes. The one on whom the faire&s;t trial was made, being confined to them and bread only for diet, (the other made u&s;e of meat occa&s;ionally) was a young woman who re&s;ided in Swit&s;erland. From her age, &s;ex, and place of abode, (if I mi&s;take not, but little fle&s;h is eaton in that country, in compari&s;on to America) we may &s;afely conjecture &s;he had not been accu&s;tomed or habituated to a &s;trong &s;timulating diet&mdash;the time of her u&s;ing this diet was mid &s;ummer&mdash;add to this &s;he had a pe|culiar fondne&s;s for this kind of fruit&mdash;all which taken col|lectively, would &s;trike the mind very differently, when applyed to an American male in the winter &s;ea&s;on: with a total di&s;reli&s;h for &s;uch food, we &s;hould at once conclude he mu&s;t fami&s;h for want of &s;upport, and not only &s;o, have his calamity increa&s;ed by the chilling acce&s;ency of the fruit&mdash;whereas in the former we may conceive of &s;ufficient &s;upport not only from what we may conclude was her habit of dieting, from the cu&s;tom of the country, but from her age, &s;ex, and peculiar inclination or ta&s;te, (which la&s;t would induce her to eat freely and add the agreeable &s;timulus of di&s;ten&s;ion, to the other &s;alutary effects) and not only &s;o, the moderate acce&s;ency, at that &s;ea&s;on of the year would &s;erve to counteract the over &s;timulus of heat, and pre&s;erve a due equilibrium of ex|citement in, and thro' the &s;y&s;tem.

<P N="76">LXXVI. By taking a retro&s;pective view of the preceding paragraphs, and turning our attention to the laws by which animal nature is governed, it will require no great di&s;cernment to di&s;cover when and how each of the&s;e &s;eeming contradictory modes of dieting, may be &s;alutary in ca&s;es of debility. Milk, and rich &s;ubacid &s;acharine fruits when equal to produce that reduction of the redundant excita|bility, to an ea&s;y comfortable point; and where any thing &s;tronger would endanger indirect debility, are no doubt the mo&s;t proper diet: but, not be|cau&s;e they act as antiphlogi&s;ties (as was the antient term) and oppo&s;e that propen&s;ity in the &s;y&s;tem to &s;thenic or tonic inflammation or inflammatory di&s;|po&s;ition. This is evident, <HI>not only</HI> from what has
<PB N="37" REF="030645_0042_0FE844E7723FC118">been already adduced to prove that the danger in this di&s;ea&s;e is from the rever&s;e of &s;uch a &s;tate, and that every thing which proves &s;alutary mu&s;t do it by <HI>invigorating,</HI> not <HI>debilitating, but al&s;o,</HI> from the great benefit derived from the u&s;e of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t durable &s;timulating diet, &s;uch as beef &s;teaks, &amp;c. in tho&s;e ca&s;es where it can be di&s;pen&s;ed with, without producing indirect, debility. And indeed it ought always to be kept in memory, that where our only expectation of removing the derange|ments in the &s;y&s;tem, is to re&s;tore the energy of the functions; that as in exerci&s;e, &s;o in diet and drinks, they ought to be as &s;timulating and durable as can be, con&s;i&s;tant with the accumulated &s;tate of the excitability, and increa&s;ed as the power of improv|ing them increa&s;es. And here I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve that exerci&s;e, be&s;ides other valuable purpo&s;es, helps us much in the di&s;pen&s;ing with, and improving by &s;uch a regimen; and likewi&s;e &s;uch regimen increa&s;es our ability for exerci&s;e. This &s;hows the advantage of uniting every &s;timulant to recover a debilitated
<PB N="38" REF="030645_0043_0FE844ED2B9A3F28">habit. Before I clo&s;e this article I think it my duty to remark the utility of raw eggs, which by expe|rience I have found to afford much durable nouri&s;h|ment, and to be ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;ed with even in a very accumulated &s;tate of the excitability.

<P N="82">LXXXII. Chronic indirect debility which hap|pens at the &s;ea&s;on of life in which con&s;umptions prevail, differs from that which attends old people in this re&s;pect, in the latter, by long and gradual application of a variety, or in other words of every &s;timulant &s;ub&s;ervient to life and health, the excita|bility in every part and every organ is &s;o worn down and decayed, that it loo&s;es the power of any dura|ble excitement, &s;o that no pro&s;pect of a re&s;toration can exi&s;t: whereas the former is commonly induced by one kind of &s;timulus alone, and altho' the exci|tability is over powered, and the &s;y&s;tem debilitated by the continued application of one powerful &s;tim|ulant, yet it is commonly if not always the ca&s;e, that in the mean time, le&s;s of every other &s;timulant is applied than in ordinary healthy ca&s;es. Hence we may conceive in&s;tead of a wa&s;ted, a rather
<PB N="42" REF="030645_0047_0FE844FD2119F408">accumulated excitability, &s;o far as it re&s;pects every exciting power except the one which by its over action has induced the debility. Con&s;equently by gradually withholding the particular hurtful &s;timuli, and a proper application of &s;uch &s;timulants as have had no &s;hare in cau&s;ing the debility, we may expect the derangements to be removed, and health and vigor again rekindled.</P>
<P N="83">LXXXIII. The caution given in ca&s;es of direct debility not to carry the effects of &s;timulants beyond a ju&s;t degree of excitement, that is, &s;uch a degree as be&s;t &s;uits the natural, ea&s;y performance of the func|tions, ought &s;trictly to be attended to in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and the more diffu&s;able nece&s;&s;ary &s;timulants ought carefully to be le&s;&s;ened, as the more perma|nent ones (&s;uch as nearer accord with a &s;tate of health) may with &s;afety be introduced.</P>
<P N="84">LXXXIV. The notion of curing chronic indi|rect debility, by direct debilitating powers, however proper it may be in its approach, yet when actually induced has no foundation in nature; for as before ob&s;erved, <HI>debility is debility</HI> let the &s;ource of it be what it may, and cannot be removed otherwi&s;e than by a proper application of &s;timulants.

This being &s;o generally the ca&s;e, it highly behoves the faculty who are called to pre&s;cribe for patients in the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, as they would be tender of the lives and wel|fare of their patients and their own reputation; in the fir&s;t place, to endeavor to bani&s;h tho&s;e fal&s;e notions not
<PB N="47" REF="030645_0051_0FE8450D2FAE0A18">only from their patients, but from their attending friends, and by explaining <HI>natures own &s;y&s;tem</HI> to them more clearly, incourage them in a rigid per&s;e|verence in the u&s;e of &s;uch exerci&s;e, regimen, change of air, &amp;c. &amp;c. as &s;hall be be&s;t adapted to their &s;ituation; <HI>rigid</HI> I &s;ay: as experience teaches us that in all ca&s;es of long continued debility, not only that, but the con&s;equent derangements (which derange|ments as occur particularly in this di&s;ea&s;e, as frequent coughing, profu&s;e expectoration, large night &s;weats, &amp;c. &s;erves to augment the debility) become habitu|al, and as it were con&s;titutional, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t require &s;trict attention in avoiding on the one hand, tho&s;e hurtful powers by which the debility was indu|ced; and on the other, a careful attention to the u&s;e of all tho&s;e powers calculated by their con&s;tant and gradually increa&s;ed application to re&s;tore the permanency of the <HI>excitability,</HI> and recal the &s;everal deranged functions to their &s;everal offices, and continued in for a <HI>length</HI> of <HI>time</HI> &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h a con&s;iderable &s;hare of &s;trength and firm|ne&s;s, as it mu&s;t be rationally &s;uppo&s;ed, that the patient will much more readily <HI>relaps</HI> into all tho&s;e <HI>derangements,</HI> peculiar to the di&s;ea&s;e, by any neglect of proper &s;upport, than if he had never been accu&s;|tomed to them.</P>
<P>I have dwelt longer, and been more explicit on this particular &s;ubject, on account of the embarra&s;&s;|ments <HI>well</HI> adopted plans are &s;ubjected to through the mi&s;taken notions of the &s;ick; &s;ay exerci&s;e for an example; how &s;eldom is it put in practice by the patient to any purpo&s;e? Riding on hor&s;e back for in&s;tance, when it bids fair to be of utility if attended to a &s;uitable time every day; the patient perhaps
<PB N="48" REF="030645_0052_0FE8450EB476D4F8">will attend to it two or three times a week, when conveniency &s;erves; and that in general, in &s;uch a manner as rather to expo&s;e him, than be of any &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h not to be under&s;tood by any thing &s;aid, to any how &s;eclude the u&s;e of medicine, even in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t chronical debility; where the natural agents which cheri&s;h and &s;upport, life and vigor fail of being adequate (as before &s;ugge&s;ted); in &s;uch ca&s;es their aid is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, and frequently it may be found of utility not only to make u&s;e of medicional &s;timulants and tonics, but bli&s;tering the parts of the brea&s;t, where, by the pain, &amp;c. we have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a more than equal degree of the diathe&s;is; occa&s;ional puking, the patient may be al&s;o indicated and other collateral pre&s;criptions which do not fall immediately under the general indication of cure. In this place I cannot forbear the recommending to the faculty; the trial (at lea&s;t) of the &s;havings of Jamaica mahogany wood in decoction in ca&s;es of diarrhoea, which frequently occur in this di&s;ea&s;e; as from &s;ome experience I have had of its u&s;e, it appears to me, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;timulant and tonic power or quality peculiarly adapted to the excitability of the inte&s;tinal canal, and bids fair to be of utility; the way I u&s;ed it, was to put 1 oz. of the &s;havings into a quart of water and boil down to a pint; the do&s;e, 1 oz. of the decoction three or four times a day.</P>
<P>Again, I would here further ob&s;erve, that as has been before remarked, `that the <HI>&s;lowne&s;s</HI> of the progre&s;s of the <HI>di&s;ea&s;e</HI> indicates <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of the hurtful powers;' &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;e,</HI> in proportion to its rapidity of progre&s;s, the <HI>&s;trength</HI> or increa&s;ed power
<PB N="49" REF="030645_0053_0FE7EE2F5152E7F0">of tho&s;e agents; is indicated, &s;o in like gradations our attention ought to be arou&s;ed to the auxiliary aid of medicine; hence more medicine and that in larger potions may be requi&s;ite in the more quick con&s;umptions, than the more &s;low.</P>
