Story; I&s;ai. XXII. 5. <HI>It is a Day of Trouble, and of Treading down, and of Perplexity by the Lord of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ts, in the Valley of Vi&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been the Felicity, wherewith <HI>Our Land</HI> has been &s;ometimes highly favoured, That tho' it has been a <HI>Valley</HI> for the <HI>Low</HI> Circum&s;tan|ces of it, Yet it has been a <HI>Valley of Vi&s;ion,</HI> for the Di&s;coveries of the Be&s;t Things with which it has been Illuminated. <HI>Thy Land, O Immanuel</HI>!</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, That it is come to be with <HI>Ours,</HI> as it was in that Land, when it was La|mented, <HI>There was no open Vi&s;ion.</HI> There is at lea&s;t <HI>One Vi&s;ion</HI> that is <HI>Open</HI> to a General View, and is generally <HI>&s;een</HI> by all that have the <HI>&s;ight</HI> of any thing at all: A <HI>Vi&s;ion</HI> &s;o <HI>plain,</HI> that he may <HI>Run who Readeth it.</HI> The <HI>Vi&s;ion</HI> which eve|ry One &s;ees is this; <HI>A Day of Trouble, and of Trea|ding down, and of Perplexity by the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> upon this <HI>Valley of Vi&s;ion,</HI> and of <HI>Crying to the Mountains.</HI> Every body &s;ees and &s;ays, We are a <HI>Mi&s;erable People,</HI> if there be not &s;omething done to help us.</P>
<P>BUT what will this <HI>Vi&s;ion</HI> of our <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> &s;ig|nify, unle&s;s to <HI>Aggravate</HI> it, if it be not accom|panied with a <HI>Vi&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Remedy?</HI> And if there be no <HI>Seers</HI> to propo&s;e the <HI>Ways</HI> &amp; <HI>Means</HI> of our Deliverance out of our <HI>Perplexity</HI>?</P>
<P>A Wi&s;e Man under the In&s;piration of GOD, has told us, what is like to become of a People, that have <HI>no Vi&s;ion</HI> among them; None to <HI>&s;ee</HI> what their <HI>Dangers</HI> are, and <HI>&s;ee</HI> what <HI>Methods</HI> are to be taken for a Re&s;cue from them.</P>

<P>THE Text with &s;uch a Glo&s;s upon it, furni&s;hes me with a Commi&s;&s;ion for a Work, which I had never been Overcome to Undertake, if the <HI>Love of my Country,</HI> with a <HI>View</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s and great Perplexity</HI> which every One &s;ees ha&s;tening upon it, had not been as a <HI>Burning Fire &s;hut up in my Bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could &s;tay no longer.</HI></P>

<P>THO' of the <HI>Fifty Six</HI> Years which I have &s;een in a <HI>Weary Pilgrimage,</HI> I have now been <HI>Thirty Nine</HI> in the Publick Service of the Churches, and found more than <HI>Five Times Seven</HI> Years ago, &s;uch a Favourable Reception with the Heads of our Tribes, that I might be&s;peak Some Regard from the mo&s;t of you, in tho&s;e Terms, <HI>Audit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Se|nem Juvenes, quem Juvenem Senes audierunt</HI>; Let the Younger now hearken to One in the Confines of Old Age, whom the Elder did in his Youth &s;ometimes hearken to: Yet I wave all &s;uch Con&s;ideration in asking for a due Attention from you, and put all the Regard that I Expect unto my Me&s;&s;age, upon the <HI>Merit of the Cau&s;e,</HI> the Truth, and the Weight, and the Importance of the <HI>Vi&s;ions</HI>; and the Va&s;t concern of the <HI>Mat|ter</HI> to be now &s;et before you.</P>

<P>THIS is the <HI>General State of our Ca&s;e.</HI> One of the more Immediate and Comprehen&s;ive Cau&s;es for the&s;e our <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> is, In that, What might invigorate our <HI>Trade,</HI> runs not among us, either in that <HI>Credit,</HI> or in that <HI>Plenty,</HI> that our Occa|&s;ions call for.

<P>THESE are the <HI>Vi&s;ions,</HI> of which I may &s;ay un|to you, <HI>I am grieved in my Spirit, in the mid&s;t of my Body, and the Vi&s;ions of my Head have troubled me.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is&mdash;<HI>Who &s;ees it not?</HI> &mdash; the <HI>Wrath of the Lord of Ho&s;ts darkening</HI> our Poor Land, in the&s;e our Unhappy Circum&s;tances. But then, if we would not be guilty of that Fault; I&s;ai.

for the Congregation,</HI> that a Reconciled GOD may in His CHRIST cau&s;e His <HI>Face to Shine</HI> upon us, and <HI>Give Peace</HI> unto us.</P>
<P>VERILY, If this Cour&s;e were followed, here would be a <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI>; There would be a <HI>Vi&s;ion of Peace</HI> among us.

But what is now propo&s;ed,
<PB N="9" REF="002036_0011_0fba8395464a9c68">
is, That &s;ome Numbers of Capable Men, would form them&s;elves into <HI>Societies,</HI> to pur&s;ue toge|ther this Enquiry, <HI>What may be done, to re&s;cue our Land out of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es coming upon it, and render us an Happy People?</HI> It were well, if this were made more a point of <HI>Daily Conver&s;ation,</HI> in our Occa&s;ional Interviews with one another. Certainly it were a more <HI>Noble Theam</HI> than tho&s;e In&s;ipid Impertinencies, which our <HI>Daily Conver|&s;ation</HI> is too commonly <HI>made Empty</HI> withal. But I pre&s;s for a more <HI>Stated Conver&s;ation</HI> upon it, in <HI>Societies,</HI> which if they cannot them&s;elves put their own <HI>Projections</HI> in Execution, may yet make their <HI>Offers</HI> of <HI>Excellent Things,</HI> to tho&s;e by whom they can be Executed; and be <HI>Indefati|gable!</HI> My Friends, Allow me to addre&s;s you after this Manner. <HI>A&s;&s;ociate your &s;elves, O ye People, that ye may not be broken in pieces; Take coun&s;el together, that it may not come to nought.</HI> If <HI>GOD be with us,</HI> you will do &s;o!</P>
<P>WERE this Point once gained, Methinks, it might Super&s;ede the re&s;t that I may have to in|&s;i&s;t upon.

<P>I will, in the next Place pa&s;s to the <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> and mention of a <HI>Third Thing,</HI> which I mu&s;t call, <HI>The Grand Expedient,</HI> for the preventing of the dreadful <HI>Perplexities,</HI> which this poor
<PB N="10" REF="002036_0012_0fba839747ba0700">
Country finds growing upon it. That which I will again and again call, The GRAND EXPE|DIENT, is, <HI>Frugality,</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>Frugality</HI>; A Di&s;crete, a Righteous, a Needful FRUGALI|TY, in our Dome&s;tick Expences: More particu|larly, A <HI>Frugality</HI> in our TABLES, and a <HI>Fruga|lity</HI> in our HABITS.

We are per|plexed with anxious Thoughts, How we &s;hall anon get our <HI>Bread,</HI> and maintain our &s;elves and our Families. But I may now &s;ay unto you, as in Prov. XX. 13. <HI>Open thine Eyes, and thou &s;halt be &s;atisfied with Bread.</HI> If you will but &s;o far <HI>Open your Eyes,</HI> as to &s;ee, what <HI>Retrenchments</HI> of <HI>Expences</HI> are ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o Ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hall now <HI>Sin grievou&s;ly,</HI> if they be not complied withal; you will &s;oon be in a way to <HI>Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>YOU may not Challenge me for tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the Province of a <HI>Divine,</HI> or on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> if I in&s;i&s;t upon a Prudent and proper <HI>Frugality,</HI> as a Thing of the la&s;t Con&s;equence for the welfare of our People.

Ingenious Men may and will project many <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means,</HI> to retrieve the Difficulties that are growing upon us. But all their Projections will Signify nothing, and we can &s;ee none but a <HI>Pal|liative Cure,</HI> until we &s;o Regulate our <HI>Expences,</HI> that we don't every Year continually run into <HI>Debt</HI> unto <HI>Other Countrys.</HI> How &s;hall we avoid running into <HI>Debt</HI> unto <HI>Other Countrys,</HI> if we don't Moderate our <HI>Expences</HI> of &s;uch Things as we fetch from thence, and are not able to Pay for?

<P>THIS Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Where there is no Vi&s;ion, the Peo|ple Peri&s;h,</HI> is by <HI>Luther</HI> &s;o interpreted, <HI>The People run fierce, and mad, and mutinous.</HI> 'Tis what I am going to &s;peak of. <HI>A Grievous Vi&s;ion is de|clared unto me!</HI></P>
<P>IT is not unlikely, that grievous Di&s;tre&s;&s;es may grow upon us. We are already got pretty far into them; A <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People</HI>! Now, 'tis <HI>Po&s;&s;ible,</HI> (and its being barely <HI>Po&s;&s;ible,</HI> is enough to be&s;peak a &s;ea&s;onable Admonition!) that the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es growing into an Extremity, there may be found &s;ome <HI>Raging Waves of the Sea,</HI> which may be for the Rai&s;ing of <HI>Mutin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI>; Mu|tinous, and Seditious, and Rebellious Actions may be madly ru&s;h'd upon.

I do now faithfully and &s;o|lemnly &s;ay unto you; That if any Men &s;hall be &s;o wretched, as to make &s;uch Criminal Muti|nies, it <HI>had been good</HI> for the Country, yea, and <HI>for them&s;elves</HI> too, that the&s;e Wretches <HI>had never been born.</HI> They them&s;elves mu&s;t <HI>Peri&s;h,</HI> as their Fathers <HI>Theudas</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI> did, in the <HI>Days of the Taxing,</HI> and the <HI>People that are drawn away</HI> with them, will <HI>come to nought,</HI> and be <HI>di&s;per&s;ed.</HI> The &s;trokes which the Sword of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity give them, will produce a <HI>Pity</HI> in the Body

And if, as the <HI>Antiochians,</HI> after a mad Crue among them, had committed a cur&s;ed Outrage, &s;ent the mo&s;t eminent Mini&s;ter they had among them, to in|tercede at the Court of the Emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> for them, we &s;hould &s;end never &s;o Many and Mournful Interce&s;&s;ors, t'will be well if we come off &s;o well as the poor People of <HI>Antioch.</HI> O our dear People, Hearken, Hearken, to the War|nings of GOD.

<P>ANY Man may, without much of a <HI>Second Sight,</HI> ea&s;ily Fore&s;ee &s;uch a Thing as this; That <HI>This</HI> is not a Country where <HI>Great E&s;tates</HI> are in our Days are to be Looked for.
