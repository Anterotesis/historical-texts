<P>THE imperfection of human nature, and the mutability of worldly things, have given birth to frequent changes, and revolutions, in kingdoms and empires. The&s;e revolutions, are nece&s;&s;arily attended with &s;triking &s;cenes and events, that command the at|tention, and frequently excite the wonder of the world. They al&s;o nece&s;&s;arily exhibit to public view, a variety of characters, e&s;pecially of &s;uch per&s;ons as were formed by nature for heroic atchievements; the final i&s;&s;ue be&s;t determines, to whom the good or evil principally belongs.</P>
<P>No doubt the providence of GOD has wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es to an&s;wer, by the&s;e things; and his hand that guides and directs them, in their mo&s;t &s;ecret cau&s;es and operations, will be
<PB N="6" REF="017655_0004_0FA212DE8B3E1128">
devoutly acknowledged, by the thoughtful and the wi&s;e.</P>
<P>SENTIMENTS of this kind are naturally &s;ug|ge&s;ted, from the glorious American Revolution, which in the cour&s;e of nature, and by the will of Heaven, has opened in our day.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een great events produced from cau&s;es but &s;mall in human view: we have pla|ces in various parts of the continent famed as theatres of bloody battles: we have a large num|ber of names recorded for patriots and heroes; and the important &s;cene, yet open on the Ame|rican &s;tage, commands the attention and wonder of the world.</P>
<P>THIS day, and the public appearances of it, impre&s;s our minds with an affecting remem|brance of a &s;ignal event, a mo&s;t tragical &s;cene that opened in this place, from which the alarm of war was founded thro' the land.</P>
<P>THE battle of Lexington, will not only mark a di&s;tingui&s;hed page in the hi&s;tory of this war, but be remembered, and mentioned, with in|dignation to Briti&s;h cruelty, and with reproach to the man that ordered, and the officers that executed the bloody orders, &s;o long as proper feelings of humanity, &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the human heart. We well remember our feelings on that
<PB N="7" REF="017655_0005_0FA212DF45284C18">
day; nor &s;hall we ever forget them: the inha|bitants of this town mu&s;t have undergone more than can be well expre&s;&s;ed; and the friends of tho&s;e who fell victims to Briti&s;h cruelty and murder, mu&s;t &s;till have aching hearts.</P>
<P>THE religious ob&s;ervance of this anniver&s;ary, with martial appearances on the day, do honor to the town, and the cau&s;e of our country,&mdash;"For this day &s;hall be unto you for a memorial."</P>
<P>THOUGH it is our duty to impre&s;s our minds with a proper recollection of the day, and its tran&s;actions, which gave birth to this anniver&s;ary, and devoutly acknowledge the hand of Provi|dence, in re&s;training the wrath and rage of our enemies, and di&s;appointing their ba&s;e de&s;igns: yet it may not be nece&s;&s;ary for me, at this time, to go over the particular tran&s;actions of that day, or attempt a de&s;cription of its horrors and di&s;tre&s;|&s;es, which fell &s;o heavily on the people of this place. In judgment, GOD remembered mercy: and among other favours in Providence, you had your faithful pa&s;tor to advi&s;e and comfort you, and lead in your devotions to GOD; and on eve|ry return of the anniver&s;ary, have devoutly ac|knowledged the hand of GOD. A religious ac|knowledgment of GOD and his Providence, is certainly the duty of a chri&s;tian people, under all changes and events: and to po&s;&s;e&s;s a frame of mind that corre&s;ponds with the mea&s;ures of Pro|vidence, is a noble attainment in religion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017655_0006_0FA212E00043DB18">
THE day and its events we are commemora|ting, lead to, and are interwoven with a &s;eries of wonders, involving our highe&s;t intere&s;ts and concerns; and al&s;o tho&s;e of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE finger of GOD has indeed been &s;o con&s;picu|ous in every &s;tage of our glorious &s;truggle, that it &s;eems as if the wonders and miracles performed for I&s;rael of old, were repeated over anew for the American I&s;rael, in our day. The hardne&s;s that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the heart of Pharaoh of old, &s;eems to have callou&s;&s;ed the heart of the Briti&s;h King; and the madne&s;s that drove that antient tyrant and his ho&s;ts into the &s;ea, appears to have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the Briti&s;h court and councils, and to have driven them and their forces to mea&s;ures, that, in human view, mu&s;t terminate in their own confu&s;ion and ruin: and this in &s;pite of the council and advice of the prudent and wi&s;e; and the repeated prayers and intreaties of the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed Americans.</P>
<P>AS the powers of nature, under the command of GOD, operated in favour of I&s;rael of old; the &s;tars in their cour&s;es fought again&s;t their enemies; the &s;un &s;topped in its cour&s;e, that I&s;rael might com|pleat their victory, kings and armies were con|quered and &s;ubdued before them: So a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing concurrence of cau&s;es, under the di|rection of the &s;ame unerring wi&s;dom, have con|&s;pired to bring about the American revolution,
<PB N="9" REF="017655_0007_0FA212E0DCE4E190">
Canaan was for a long time, a land of re&s;t and liberty for GOD'S people of old: &s;o we have our rai&s;ed hopes and expectations this day, that our land will &s;oon become a quiet habitation, an a&s;&s;ylum to the oppre&s;&s;ed throughout the world, and the joy of the whole earth.</P>
<P>IN miraculous productions, we &s;ee and own the hand of GOD, but are apt to di&s;regard it, in common events; forgetting that the providence of GOD ought as much to be owned and ac|knowledged by us in events which we can trace from their natural cau&s;es, as in prodigies, or mi|raculous productions, that appear to be the im|mediate effect of the almighty power of GOD. And as this, we generally &s;ay, is not the age of miracles, there is &s;omehow, a &s;trange and &s;inful in&s;en&s;ibility to the interpo&s;ition and agency of GOD, which too generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es our minds. We &s;top at &s;econd cau&s;es, but forget GOD, the great and fir&s;t cau&s;e of all: we admire the he|roi&s;m of the general; we prai&s;e the valour and bravery of the &s;oldier;&mdash;but forget that &s;alva|tion is of the LORD.</P>
<P>THE whole of our arduous &s;truggle, is indeed but a &s;cene of wonder and amazement; exhibit|ing the mo&s;t &s;triking marks of the interpo&s;ition and agency of GOD. However politicians have been employed, the ambition and anger of men been rai&s;ed, and the greate&s;t exertions of hu|man
<PB N="10" REF="017655_0008_0FA212E18B998738">
power put forth; yet as &s;ober men and chri&s;tians, it becomes us to look above all the&s;e things, and acknowledge and adore the hand of Providence.</P>
<P>THE time, it &s;eems, was come, the full pe|riod commenced, appointed by the councils of Heaven, in the cour&s;e of nature, when a new Empire &s;hould ari&s;e in the world, and a nation be born in a day; that wi&s;dom which governs the world, determines events, and driveth a&s;un|der the nations, prepared the cau&s;es in the natu|ral, the moral, and political world to unite their forces and accompli&s;h the great event. Hence a &s;pirit of liberty mu&s;t &s;timulate this large peo|ple, and like a &s;preading torrent flow over the land: the pa&s;&s;ions of men mu&s;t be arou&s;ed: the &s;word, which is never wantonly u&s;ed but by ty|rants, robbers and madmen, mu&s;t be drawn; and to the reproach of humanity, &s;cenes of blood and carnage mu&s;t en&s;ue:&mdash;Alliances mu&s;t be formed, and battles fought, that the foundation of the new Empire, like mo&s;t others in the world, might be laid in blood;&mdash;a foundation &s;adly ominous of its future overthrow and ruin, which, in their turn and order, will be the fate of all the kingdoms and empires of the world.</P>
<P>IT is certainly a memorable Providence, that in the beginning of the controver&s;y, &s;uch a &s;pirit of liberty &s;hould &s;o generally fill the land. The
<PB N="11" REF="017655_0009_0FA212E24007A508">
nations of Europe, it &s;eems, for a long time, have been much lo&s;t to a &s;en&s;e of liberty. As to many of them, the body of the people are but lit|tle better than &s;laves to their princes and kings: long inured to oppre&s;&s;ion, they have become in|&s;en&s;ible to their yoke, as the &s;tupid a&s;s to the burthen it carries. But the &s;ons of America had not yet lo&s;t the noble &s;pirit of their ance&s;tors, and therefore di&s;dained to be the &s;laves of Bri|tain. Not di&s;mayed by threatenings, or dangers, they engaged in the arduous work, determined to be free; and have exhibited examples of uni|on, virtue, per&s;everance and heroi&s;m, that are mentioned with admiration throughout the world. In following the &s;teps of Providence, our duty has been pointed out from time to time; and favourable events &s;ucceeding one another, we are at length conducted, by the hand of a kind Providence, within fight of the great object of our toils.</P>
<P>As the original &s;ource of the American revo|lution, under Providence, was that &s;en&s;e of li|berty, which was &s;o univer&s;ally impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of this people, it ought in rea&s;on to be viewed as a &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of Providence, from who&s;e dominions the hearts of men are not exempted.</P>
<P>THIS great principle of liberty formed a u|nion, which neither the power nor policy of Bri|tain
<PB N="12" REF="017655_0010_0FA212E31A5CA070">
have been able to break: a union, which has been con&s;tantly &s;trengthening and increa&s;ing, e|ven from tho&s;e very mea&s;ures that were de&s;ign|ed by our enemies to confound and de&s;troy it. Not only our own dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but e|ven the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and cruelties of our enemies, have con&s;pired, under Providence, to cement this people in a band of union, which at this day may defy the rage and power of tyrants; "for it is now con&s;olidated by a confederation happi|ly compleated." Thus united and bound, the&s;e American States, in a collective view, form a large empire, which bids fair, in the cour&s;e of nature, to exceed all the empires of the world; they &s;pread over an amazing extent of country, that by rapid population is daily filling with in|habitants. It is not improbable but the exten|&s;ive countries of Canada and Nova Scotia will ere long be joined in the union: nor is it impo&s;|&s;ible but the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, from their local &s;ituation, may, in &s;ome future period, become the property of the&s;e American States. Alas! what &s;urpri&s;ing productions, what exten&s;ive pro&s;pects, has this great &s;pirit of liberty, under Providence produced?</P>
<P>VERY ob&s;ervable have been the interpo&s;itions of Providence, in rai&s;ing up, for us, numerous and powerful friends. Even in Britain, and in the Briti&s;h court, per&s;ons of the highe&s;t reputa|tion for virtue and knowledge, have owned the
<PB N="13" REF="017655_0011_0FA212E3C53AB308">
ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, and done much to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport it: by their friendly aid, we re|ceived from time to time, notice of the de&s;igns and plans of our enemy, a circum&s;tance of high importance and utility.</P>
<P>BUT our greate&s;t human friend and &s;upporter is, His Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty the King of France, whom that GOD who has the hearts of kings in his hands, di&s;po&s;ed to enter into a mo&s;t generous alliance with the&s;e States; and he has given us the &s;tronge&s;t evidences of his &s;incerity and friend&s;hip. From &s;uch a power|ful ally we have indulged rai&s;ed hopes and ex|pectations, and have experienced eminent and important &s;ervices, that have even exceeded our expectations. We well know our ab&s;olute need of this foreign aid, and the many ways in which we have felt the benefit of it; but I fear we are not in general &s;o mindful of the hand of Divine Providence, in this particular, as we ought in ju&s;tice to be.</P>
<P>THAT a nation of different manners, different language and religion, and with minds barred again&s;t us, by national prejudices, which, like national habits, are &s;tubborn and incurable by human art and addre&s;s, &s;hould at once form &s;o open, friendly, and generous an alliance, with the&s;e poor and oppre&s;&s;ed States; that their armies and forces &s;hould harmonize with ours, like bre|thren
<PB N="14" REF="017655_0012_0FA212E482FC9A48">
in a common cau&s;e; and all ranks of men among them, &s;o highly intere&s;t them&s;elves in our concerns, and &s;o freely &s;hed their blood in our cau&s;e, di&s;covers the hand of Providence, the kind influence of heaven; and it is much too great a compliment to human wi&s;dom and abi|lities, to con&s;ider them as the &s;ole cau&s;es of &s;uch great events.</P>
<P>FROM education and prejudice, we have ge|nerally been trained up from our cradles, to con|ceive unfavourably of the French nation. We viewed them as a kind of natural enemy, and &s;uch were our feelings towards them: and hence it is not &s;o much to be wondered at, that &s;ome among us appeared to be &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to the va&s;t importance of our alliance with France. However, a number of real facts abundantly convince us of our error and mi&s;take, and prove our prejudices to be ill founded. And from the be&s;t authority and information, as well as from our own experience, we are now induced to view and e&s;teem the French by far the mo&s;t poli&s;hed, humane, and generous people in the world. Their naval force, which from time to time has been &s;ent to America, has undoubt|edly prevented our enemies from burning our &s;eat-port towns: and their troops, united with the American arms, under the command of our illu&s;trious General the la&s;t year, effected the greate&s;t and mo&s;t happy event of the war; a
<PB N="15" REF="017655_0013_0FA212E541FFDF10">
victory that will make as brilliant a figure in hi&s;|tory as any to be met with, either in ancient or modern wars.</P>
<P>A FRIEND in need, is a friend in deed. At this day we both &s;ee our need of this friendly aid, and feel the happy effects of it; greater foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance we could not expect; that to be in&s;en&s;ible of their kindne&s;s, mu&s;t expo&s;e us to be reproached with ba&s;e ingratitude; and not to acknowledge the hand of Providence in this alliance, mu&s;t bring upon us the guilt of great impiety.</P>
<P>MEMORABLE have been the interpo&s;itions of Providence, in bla&s;ting and counteracting the de&s;igns of our enemy, and in di&s;covering and de|tecting their mean and wicked plots and in|treagues. We have often &s;een their councils turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s, and their &s;ecret machi|nations detected. When their open violence has proved abortive, they have frequently at|tempted to effect their purpo&s;e by fraud and de|ceit. As if de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s from their troops, they have had recour&s;e to traitors among our&s;elves. Nay, &s;o great is their malice and rancour, they would undoubtedly, with wicked Saul of old, in the hour of de&s;pair, readily go to the witch of Endor, if they might but ob|tain their point; but there is no enchantment again&s;t Jacob, neither is there any divination
<PB N="16" REF="017655_0014_0FA212E7B5CDED00">
again&s;t I&s;rael, according to this time it &s;hall be &s;aid of Jacob and of I&s;rael, what hath GOD wrought? The &s;ame overruling Providence that bla&s;ted their open force, has detected their &s;ecret fraud.</P>
<P>THERE have been, al&s;o, &s;ignal appearances of Providence in our favour, in times of our greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and danger. When our ene|mies have had their greate&s;t triumphs, and we of con&s;equence our darke&s;t hours, &s;ome of our greate&s;t deliverances and victories have been &s;ent. So &s;ignal have been the mea&s;ures of divine pro|vidence, that the greate&s;t pro&s;perity and &s;ucce&s;|&s;es of our enemy, &s;eem to have been ordered, to prepare them for a greater overthrow; this is the doing of the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</P>
<P>EVERY prop our enemy &s;eem to have de|pended upon, has failed them in its turn. They have &s;ent their &s;ecret emi&s;aries among us, to bribe and deceive, but it did not avail. They &s;ome|times hoped for factions among our&s;elves, and did all in their power to foment them, but have been happily di&s;appointed. They much ex|pected our money would fail us, but have the mortification to &s;ee their own money &s;upporting our cau&s;e. They once thought we could do no|thing at fighting, for the want of arms, but now find from woful experience, that we fight them, and beat them, with their own arms.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="017655_0015_0FA212E840501FB8">
IT not their la&s;t, yet their greate&s;t hopes and dependence appear to have been placed upon a General, differently di&s;tingui&s;hed in Britain and America; there by his high birth and fame; here by his &s;hocking inhumanity and cruelty, who was permitted for a time, greatly to annoy and di&s;tre&s;s our brethren in the &s;outhern &s;tates: but ble&s;&s;ed be God, that General, with his whole army, are now pri&s;oners in our hands. Verily the Lord has done great things for us, the Lord has triumphed gloriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>FROM a &s;eries of favourable events, and the pre&s;ent a&s;pects of providence; from the &s;ucce&s;|&s;es of our arms; the completion of our union; the favourable change of our currency; the fee|ble &s;tate of our enemy; and the de&s;pair of tho&s;e mi&s;taken and wretched men, that are denomi|nated tories, we cannot but entertain rai&s;ed hopes that our deliverance is ju&s;t at hand, and the ble&s;&s;ings of peace will &s;oon be re&s;tored, and our independence &s;ecured; when this land of liberty will become a quiet habitation; the wilderne&s;s blo&s;&s;om like a ro&s;e; commerce and agriculture flouri&s;h; the arts and &s;ciences be cultivated; and generations yet unborn &s;hall rejoice in the happy purcha&s;es of our trea&s;ure and blood.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the great things which God has done, and is doing for us, and the plea|&s;ing pro&s;pect before us, we hear from &s;ome few
<PB N="18" REF="017655_0016_0FA212E9020DF0A0">
the voice of complaint and the growls of avarice; and the general &s;ubject is, the burden of taxes. Alas! my chri&s;tian friends, what is money, to the great ble&s;&s;ings of liberty? to be freed from the jaws of tyranny, to live in freedom our&s;elves, and leave our po&s;terity after us free, are ble&s;|&s;ings of infinitely more value than all the wealth of the world. The kindne&s;s of heaven, and the bounties of providence be&s;towed upon us, are enough to hu&s;h and &s;uppre&s;s every unea&s;y &s;enti|ment of this kind, where there is the lea&s;t &s;park of ingenuity or public &s;pirit. Had we lo&s;t all our wealth, but pre&s;erved our liberty, we &s;hould have been great gainers; but by the kindne&s;s of heaven, we may pre&s;erve them both.</P>
<P>IT is true, our taxes are heavy, and demands for our exertions are pre&s;&s;ing, and what el&s;e in rea&s;on could we po&s;&s;ibly expect? But let me tell you, that great &s;pirit which fir&s;t led us to di&s;dain Briti&s;h tyranny, that has enabled us to brave every danger, and &s;urmount the greate&s;t ob&s;tacles; that &s;pirit which has conquered whole armies of our enemies, one after another, and humbled the pride of Britain, will ea&s;ily prevail with us, to part with a little of our money to compleat the glorious work.</P>
<P>INDEED, I by no means think, that we &s;hall find our public charges to be &s;uch mighty diffi|culties as &s;ome avaricious and unfriendly minds
<PB N="19" REF="017655_0017_0FA212EB31E8FE28">
would feign &s;ugge&s;t. Should the infatuation of Britain continue, and it &s;eems likely at pre&s;ent it will, it will help us to money to pay our debts, as it has furni&s;hed us with arms to fight our battles. The immen&s;e &s;ums Great Britain is con&s;tantly &s;ending over to America, to defray the expences of her wicked war, will in the i&s;&s;ue, chiefly centre in the Americans pockets. By impoveri&s;hing them&s;elves, to gratify their lu&s;t of power and revenge, they will in fine greatly en|rich the&s;e States.</P>
<P>A LITTLE exertion, and public &s;pirit, I doubt not, will ea&s;ily carry us through all our expen|ces. Le&s;&s;ons of prudence, oeconomy and indu&s;|try, are naturally inculcated upon us, when mo|ney is &s;carce, and taxes are high: and the&s;e are profitable le&s;&s;ons for a people at all times.</P>
<P>WE chearfully part with our money when we think we have a good bargain; and certainly there cannot in nature be a better bargain ob|tained with money, than liberty for our land, and freedom for our&s;elves and our po&s;terity.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;hould Great Britain gain their point, we may ab&s;olutely depend upon lo&s;ing our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and our necks together. For there is not the lea&s;t &s;cruple in the matter, but the &s;ub|jugation of the&s;e States would be followed with the mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;cenes of hanging and gib|betting,
<PB N="20" REF="017655_0018_0FA212EB8DF7E998">
from one end of the continent to the other, that was ever known, in any country or age of the world; all promi&s;es, covenants, ho&s;ta|ges and acts of parliament to the contrary not|with&s;tanding.</P>
<P>LET us therefore &s;teadily follow the guidance of providence, and chearfully do our duty, and I doubt not we &s;hall yet &s;ee the &s;alvation of God, and our po&s;terity will long rejoice in the happy fruits of our toils and wars.</P>
<P>THE militia of this town merit a particular addre&s;s at this time.&mdash;</P>

You &s;aw your brethren and friends fall victims to the lawle&s;s power and &s;word of Britain, exerted in a mo&s;t fooli&s;h, wan|ton and wicked manner. From that hour to the pre&s;ent moment, you have heard the cry of their innocent blood &s;ounding in your ears, and calling aloud for vengeance. Your &s;pirit and ex|ertion on that day, evidence a martial zeal and ardor in your country's cau&s;e: and we tru&s;t you will always be ready to defend your country, at the hazard of your lives.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="017655_0019_0FA212EE05B4C8F0">
YOU never can want for motives for exerti|on, as you never can forget the murder of your friends. You and your country will always re|member with marks of di&s;tingui&s;hed re&s;pect and honour, tho&s;e per&s;ons that fir&s;t fell &s;acrifices to our glorious cau&s;e: their &s;urviving friends have the pity of their country, and we heartily wi&s;h them the con&s;olation of God.</P>
<P>As your names are recorded, and your fame exten&s;ive, you will di&s;tingui&s;h your&s;elves, by every exertion and virtue, of patrioti&s;m and pub|lic &s;pirit. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing to quick|en your feelings of indignation and abhorrence of Briti&s;h tyranny, or to perpetuate an indignant remembrance of Briti&s;h troops; but mu&s;t urge you to remember with gratitude to God, his kind appearance for us, in that hour of danger and rage.</P>
<P>As that memorable day, which opened the great &s;cene of the American war, and forever di&s;&s;olved our union with Britain, has been fol|lowed with &s;urpri&s;ing appearances of providence in our favour, &s;o in celebrating this anniver&s;ary, it becomes us to ble&s;s and prai&s;e God for his manifold mercies to our land.</P>
<P>A CHRISTIAN &s;oldier is a noble character indeed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, to your martial addre&s;s, you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to add the ornaments of our

holy religion, and take to your&s;elves the whole armour of God. To a zeal for your country you will add a zeal for God. To a de&s;ire to con|quer your temporal enemies, you will add a de|&s;ire to conquer &s;atan and &s;in, and obtain a victory over every &s;inful lu&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion. And to your &s;truggles for liberty, you will add your uncea&s;ing endeavours and prayers, to be made free from &s;in, and become the &s;ervants of God, that your fruit may be unto holine&s;s, and your end ever|la&s;ting life.</P>
<P>GOD, who has done, and is doing &s;uch great things for us, ju&s;tly expects, that we improve to the glory of his name. His ears have been open to our cries in the hours of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and his powerful arm has hitherto protected and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> us: therefore let our hearts be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and our whole lives but one continued <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of prai&s;e unto GOD.</P>
<P>NOR let us cea&s;e to pray that God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> di|rect our coun&s;els; pro&s;per our arms; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> illu&s;trious ally; and always keep our comman|der in chief under his holy protection; and &s;oon re&s;tore and e&s;tabli&s;h an honorable peace, that we may have none to mole&s;t us, or make us afraid.</P>
<P>WE &s;till hear the alarm of war in our land, and the calls of our country for our mo&s;t &s;trenu|ous
<PB N="23" REF="017655_0021_0FA212F01D1BC458">
exertions. We have not as yet put off the harne&s;s, nor does <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> become us to boa&s;t; but we have con&s;tantly new and nobler motives, to ani|mate and encourage us. Our foreign aid and friend&s;hip, we perceive, is daily increa&s;ing; and our pro&s;pects are enlarging, and brightening in our view. More than this, we have what we no ways de&s;erve, the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, and the &s;miles of Providence, in the agreeable and promi&s;ing opening of the &s;pring. I am &s;ure &s;uch things as the&s;e, mu&s;t be animating to the feelings of every ingenuous mind. The path of duty, is our path to &s;afety; and in &s;erving GOD, we in the be&s;t manner &s;erve our&s;elves, our country and po&s;terity. Let us hearken to the united voice of the&s;e motives and calls, and pre&s;ent our&s;elves living &s;acrifices unto GOD. We have the ble&s;|&s;ed go&s;pel in our hands, which contains the calls and invitations of our glorious redeemer, and the great promi&s;e of eternal life.</P>
<P>IN late years, we have pa&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing changes; but we have all, an infinitely greater change to pa&s;s, our change by death. We have had &s;trik|ing &s;cenes, one after another, open to our view; but they are not to be compared to tho&s;e invi&s;i|ble &s;cenes that will open upon us in the eternal world.</P>
<P>WE have felt much from the terrors and a|larms of war; but what are the&s;e to the terrors
<PB N="24" REF="017655_0022_0FA212F1B18A6750">
of a judgment to come, and to the trump of GOD, that &s;hall one day pierce our ears, and rai&s;e the dead. Seeing we look for &s;uch things as the&s;e, what manner of per&s;ons ought we to be, in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o experienced the joys of victory and triumph over our enemies; plea&s;ing &s;en&s;a|tions to mankind in general: but they are mere trifles, to that victory and triumph over &s;in, death and hell, that &s;hall crown the &s;olemnity of the la&s;t day.</P>
<P>To be &s;uperior to the fear of our enemies, is indeed a plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation; but by far a nobler one, to be &s;uperior to the fears of death, from a lively faith in him, who has conquered death, and &s;cattered &s;o much light into the gloomy man|&s;ion of the grave.</P>
<P>WE are all wi&s;hing and praying for the ble&s;|&s;ings of peace, that we may enjoy quiet and re&s;t; but the peace of Heaven, the re&s;t which remains for GOD's people above, is infinitely more de&s;erv|ing of our labor, wi&s;hes and prayers.</P>
<P>LET us then, never forget, that we are candi|dates for immortal felicity, and &s;hall &s;oon have done with all worldly things, and enter upon the invi&s;ible world; and therefore be &s;oberly concerned, to approve our&s;elves, to our con&s;cien|ces, to our country, and to our GOD, and then un&s;peakably great &s;hall be our reward in Heaven.</P>
