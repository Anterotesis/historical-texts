<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Sermon being preach'd by my worthy Brother &amp; Collegue on occa|&s;ion of the Decea&s;e of an <HI>honourable &amp; mo&s;t valuable aged Per&s;on,</HI> who&s;e excellent Conduct, both in private &amp; publick Life, thro' a long Series of Years, hath made him &s;hine as an uncommon <HI>Light</HI> in this degenerate Age; I cannot but take a Plea&s;ure in the Hope, that as a la&s;ting Honour will be done to the Name of our decea&s;ed Friend &amp; Father, &s;o the Glory of GOD, the Credit of Religion, and the Benefit of Survivors will be promoted by the Publication of it; e&s;pecially in that a <HI>double</HI> Pattern is here exhibited, eminently amiable and reverend, and meriting univer&s;al Imi|tation.</P>
<P>The Words of the Text relating to the <HI>Scripture-Nathanael</HI> (who, it's probably tho't was the &s;ame with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Bartholomew</HI>) appear'd &s;o ju&s;tly applicable to our deceas'd <HI>Nathanael,</HI> as pointing out the particular Genius &amp; reigning Temper of his Soul, that they often occur'd to my Thoughts, when con|ver&s;ing with him in his Life; as they im|mediately did to my Rev. Brother on his Death: and they certainly afforded a very proper Theme for a Funeral-Di&s;cour&s;e upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, Col. <HI>Byfield</HI>'s known &s;uperior Worth loudly be&s;pake all the Hon|ours to his Memory proper to come from the

&s;acred Desk: and tho' &s;ome peculiar Rea&s;ons have for the&s;e later Years very much re&s;train'd me from bringing <HI>Funeral-Characters</HI> into the Pulpit, and may perhaps influence me for the future to be very &s;paring on this Head; yet I can hardly excu&s;e my &s;elf, upon a cool Re|flection, that I have in this particular extra|ordinary Ca&s;e &s;o much indulg'd my Inclination to Silence on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. He him&s;elf (if I mi&s;take not) had an Aver&s;ion to pompous De&s;criptions in Funeral-Sermons: and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, they often carry too much the appearance of ful&s;ome <HI>Panegyrick</HI>; adapted rather to di&s;play the Powers of the Orator, than the Merits of the Subject. However, in the <HI>pre&s;ent Ca&s;e,</HI> where &s;uch a Variety of excellent <HI>Gifts</HI> &amp; Accompli&s;hments, where &s;o con&s;picuous a Pattern of real <HI>Sanctity,</HI> and &s;o long a Run of publick <HI>Service &amp; Reputa|tion</HI> concur'd, to furni&s;h out a very lovely and illu&s;trious Character; it might be thought, by &s;uch as have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his Value, a Wrong to the World, and an Injury to Reli|gion, as well as Inju&s;tice to the memory of the Deceas'd, if his Mini&s;ters had forborn to drop a Tear over his Grave, and publickly recommend his Example. &mdash; I willingly now take this opportunity to join with my Brother in doing it.</P>
<P>When I view the <HI>excellent and venerable Per&s;on,</HI> who&s;e Death we are lamenting, and reflect on the &s;everal Parts of his genuine Character, he appears to me to have been very happy in rare Endowments both of Na|ture

<P>He is acknowledg'd to have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h'd Furniture</HI> for the important Pro|vinces he was call'd to act in: and &s;teadily conducted him&s;elf in them, as much I believe as any man, by the dictates of his <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> and a well-weigh'd Experi|ence; and he was u&s;ually &s;atisfy'd in his own deliberate Judgment: which ever pre&s;erv'd to him a peaceful Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>He had a Greatne&s;s of Soul, that made him &s;corn the mean Tricks of Cra&s;t, dete&s;t the little arts of Flattery, and hate a Bribe.</P>
<P>He was an admirer of Order &amp; Decorum, and a proper Regimen in all Things: A &s;hin|ing Pattern of Sobriety &amp; &s;trict Virtue; of Indu&s;try; of punctual Veracity &amp; Hone&s;ty; and of Liberality on various Occa&s;ions, for which he kept him&s;elf prepar'd by con&s;tantly devoting a certain Proportion of his annual Increa&s;e to pious &amp; charitable U&s;es. One in&s;tance in particular (for its noble nature) de&s;erves to be remembred; It is not long &s;ince he was at the Expence of an Impre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m,</HI> which (to the number of <HI>Ten Thou&s;and</HI>) he di&s;pers'd in the Country Towns, where they might be mo&s;t needed.</P>
<P>He was an In&s;tance of <HI>early</HI> Piety: and his <HI>fir&s;t Love</HI> continu'd &amp; vi&s;ibly grew thro the &s;ucceeding Coar&s;e of his long Life. He was a Man of Prayer, and much in <HI>Com|munion

with GOD</HI>; which they may deride, that are unacquainted with it. He was a careful Redeemer of his Morning &amp; Evening|Hours for Divine Contemplation &amp; Devotion in the Clo&s;et; a &s;teady maintainer of good Oeconomy &amp; religious Duties in the Family; a con&s;tant and &s;ea&s;onable Attender of the publick Wor&s;hip; a con&s;cientious keeper of the Sabbath; a diligent Reader of the holy Bible; a wi&s;e ob&s;erver of Divine Providence; a Promoter of &s;erious &amp; profitable Communi|cation; a faithful Reprover of Sin; a &s;ervent Lover of Zion; a great Example of Patience and pious Fortitude under afflictive Trials, and always breathing the Faith and Hope and Humility of an improv'd Saint on a Sick Bed. &mdash; Having had his Conver&s;ation in Hea|ven, and being &s;atisfy'd with Life, he de&s;ir'd to depart and be with Chri&s;t: and at length fini&s;h'd his Cour&s;e with Joy, triumphing in the near view and believing expectation of a ble&s;&s;ed endle&s;s Futurity.</P>
<P>It remains only to ask the Prayers of all the Friends of our <HI>Zion,</HI> that GOD would pour out his Spirit, and be the <HI>Repairer of the Breaches</HI> made upon us, in the Deaths of pious &amp; u&s;eful Per&s;ons; and to recommend the following valuable Di&s;cour&s;e to the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing, that it may be of u&s;e to all into who&s;e bands it may come, to promote in them that <HI>Sincerity,</HI> which is here repre&s;ented and ex|emplified, and which will &s;ecure to them the Approbation of GOD in this World, and a glorious Reward in the next.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Bo&s;ton, N.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF we take a view of tho&s;e holy men of old, of whom we have an account in the in&s;pir'd writings, we &s;hall find a great diver&s;ity in their &s;everal characters. They are all repre&s;ented as truly ex|cellent persons: yet they &s;hine with a diff|ering lu&s;tre: &s;ome in a higher, and others in a lower degree of brightne&s;s; &s;ome in the glory
<PB N="2" REF="003640_0008_100316FB10BEC610">
of one virtue; and others in the glory of an|other: according to the various turns of their natural temper and genius, and the gifts of almighty GOD diversely conferred on them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> glory of <HI>Nathanael,</HI> &s;eems to have been his undi&s;gui&s;ed, &s;incerely open temper and conduct, both towards GOD and man. His character upon other accounts, no doubt, was con&s;iderable: but this being one of the mo&s;t eminent &amp; ob&s;ervable &s;trokes in it, our SAVIOUR &s;ingles it out to be a &s;tanding pattern, worthy of univer&s;al imita|tion.</P>
<P>NOTHING that I remember, is any were in the <HI>bible</HI> recorded of this <HI>Nathanael,</HI> &s;ave only the place where he liv'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which appears to have been <HI>Cana</HI> in <HI>Galilee,</HI> &s;ee <HI>John 2I.2</HI></NOTE>; be&s;ides what we find in the pa&s;&s;age of hi&s;tory, of which my <HI>text</HI> is a part: upon which account, we are at a lo&s;s to determine who he was; from what particular family he de&s;cended; what &s;tation he fill'd, or civil figure he made in the world.</P>
<P>ONE thing my <HI>context</HI> mentions worthy our remark; That at the time, when our SA|VIOUR be&s;tow'd upon him this commenda|tion, he was &s;o far from being a <HI>believer</HI> in CHRIST, that he laboured of a very unhappy mi&s;take with relation to his <HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip.</HI> For
<PB N="3" REF="003640_0009_100317027A655B28">
when <HI>Philip</HI> addre&s;t him in that language,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 45</NOTE> <HI>we have found him of whom Mo&s;es in the law, and prophets did write,</HI> JESUS OF NAZARETH: I &s;ay when he was thus addre&s;t, the common notion that then pre|vail'd among the <HI>Jews,</HI> was the reply he had ready at hand, <HI>can there any good thing come out of Nazareth</HI>? This was certainly a very great and dangerous mi&s;take; and if <HI>Philip,</HI> who was him&s;elf convinced that JESUS was the CHRIST, had been of a warm temper, and inclined to har&s;h judgment, he might have cen&s;ur'd him as one that had rejected CHRIST, and was void of all &s;incerity &amp; real goodness. But if he had done thus, he would have been greatly to blame; for at that very time, our SAVIOUR, who knew the hearts of all men, pronounced him <HI>an I&s;raelite indeed.</HI> He was &s;atisfied the mi&s;take he was under, did not proceed from prevailing corruption; but want of light: the evidence of his <HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip,</HI> having not yet been laid before him. He therefore allows him to be a real &s;aint; and &s;peaks very honourably of him: which I take this notice of, to teach us moderation and charity; and re&s;train us from attributing any mi&s;takes or errors, whither of faith or practice, to the badne&s;s of men's hearts, which for all any thing we know, may be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;incerity, and GOD's knowing them to be real &s;aints. But to return.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003640_0010_1003170795A39CA0">MY <HI>text</HI> pre&s;ents us with a very fair and beautiful character: which may be depended on as an exact repre&s;entation; &s;ince it came from one of in&s;allable skill &amp; judgment. And there is this extraordinary circum&s;tance in it; Our SAVIOUR &s;pake thus of <HI>Nathanael</HI> without any previous acquaintance; in&s;tantly upon the very fir&s;t &s;ight of him. A &s;ure in|dication of his being <HI>more than a man</HI>! And it probably had it's influence upon <HI>Nathanael</HI> in producing that confe&s;&s;ion from him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 49.</NOTE>, <HI>Rabbi, thou art the &s;on of God, thou art the king of I&s;rael.</HI> He was &s;en&s;ible our SA|VIOUR had no knowledge of him: and yet was con&s;cious to him&s;elf, he had given the exact portraiture of his &s;oul. And there|fore rightly argues upon it, <HI>thou art the &s;on of God.</HI> And from this time he became a <HI>true Chri&s;tian,</HI> as before he was a <HI>real Saint.</HI></P>
<P>TWO things are here &s;aid of <HI>Nathanael,</HI> in which his character is &s;umm'd up.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THAT he was <HI>an I&s;raelite indeed.</HI> And</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> AN I&s;raelite indeed, <HI>in whom is no guile.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY there are the two beads, under which I &s;hall with all po&s;&s;ible brevity, open to you this character: which when I have done, I &s;hall more largely apply it in the be&s;t manner I am able.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="003640_0011_1003170C424C2E38">
<HI>I.</HI> HE was <HI>an I&s;raelite indeed.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a twofold application of the name <HI>I&s;raelite.</HI> Tis &s;ometimes us'd to &s;igni|fie a natural defendant of <HI>Jacob,</HI> who was afterwards called <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> So the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> na|tion are frequently called <HI>I&s;raelites</HI>: and the mo&s;t common name for any one of the &s;tock of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was that, an <HI>I&s;raelite.</HI> And in this &s;ence, its likely <HI>Nathanael</HI> was an <HI>I&s;ra|elite indeed.</HI> i. e. A true &s;on, the genuine off|&s;pring of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; as immediately proceeding from him by natural generation.</P>
<P>But there is a far better and more excellent &s;en&s;e of this word. It often &s;tands to &s;pecifie the <HI>&s;pritual</HI> po&s;terity of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> i.e. his chil|dren by re&s;emblance, or participation of the &s;ame likene&s;s of piety and goodne&s;s. Hence that of the Apo&s;tle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 9.6.</NOTE> <HI>they are not all I&s;rael, which are of I&s;rael.</HI> He plainly di&s;tingui&s;hes between <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and allows the appella|tion in its <HI>&s;pecial &amp; be&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e, only to tho&s;e, who like their father <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> are the &s;ubjects of real holine&s;s.</P>
<P>AND 'tis in this &s;en&s;e <HI>Nathanael</HI> is here call'd <HI>an I&s;realite.</HI> And he is &s;aid to be an I&s;raelite <HI>indeed.</HI> The meaning of the phra&s;e put into literal engli&s;h is obviou&s;ly this, that he was <HI>a real good man</HI>; a <HI>true Saint</HI> and <HI>faithful &s;ervant</HI> of the mo&s;t high.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003640_0012_10031672303B3E88">NOT that he was perfectly and indefec|tively &s;o. In &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, <HI>there is not a ju&s;t man upon earth, that doth good and &s;in|neth not.</HI> He was therefore a <HI>man of like pa&s;&s;ions with others</HI>; had his faults and fail|ings. But they were only the &s;pots of GOD's children. He had notwith&s;tanding a prevail|ing awe and reverence for the ble&s;&s;ed GOD; an habitual love to virtue: and made it his careful endeavour to follow after it.</P>
<P>HE had upon his mind a reali&s;ing convic|tion of future and invi&s;ible things: and it had a governing influence upon his heart and life. He was afraid of &s;in, and dare not <HI>knowingly</HI> allow him&s;elf in the commi&s;&s;ion of it. And if thro' mi&s;take, or the prevailing &s;trength of corruption or temptation, he was at any time led a&s;ide, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it only in here and there an in&s;tance: his general cour&s;e being at the &s;ame time, in &s;ome good mea&s;ure conformed to the great rule of duty.</P>
<P>THE principles of grace were certainly predominant in his &s;oul; the reigning bent of his mind on the &s;ide of virtue: and &s;uch his manner of life, that he had the approbati|on of his con&s;cience for his rejoicing; and could addre&s;s the holy GOD in the language of <HI>Hezekiah</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah 38.3.</NOTE>, <HI>Remember O Lord, I be&s;eech thee, how I have walk'd before thee in truth,
<PB N="7" REF="003640_0013_100316B34C6DBF58">
and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight</HI>! Yet mu&s;t we look upon him as deeply humbled and aba&s;ed, when he con&s;ider'd how far he had fallen &s;hort of what might in &s;trictne&s;s have been exacted of him; and as having his hope not in him&s;elf, but the meer mercy of a mo&s;t gracious GOD, thro' the <HI>promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah and &s;aviour.</HI></P>
<P>THUS was he a <HI>good man,</HI> a <HI>true Saint.</HI> And O how beautiful does he appear in this view! His greate&s;t glory was his being an <HI>Israelite indeed.</HI></P>
<P>POSSIBLY he was cloathed with civil honour; po&s;&s;e&s;t large intellectual endowments and liv'd in flowing outward circum&s;tances: but 'twas his being a real holy man that ren|der'd him far more great and noble: as he hereby re&s;embled the infinitely glorious GOD, was conformed to the Image of the lovely JESUS, and became a temple of the HOLY GHOST. And O the inconceivable advan|tage of his being a &s;aint of the mo&s;t high! By this means he became the delight of his maker, an actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of that divine loving kindne&s;s, which is better than even life it&s;elf, and an heir to all the great and invaluable promi&s;es of the &s;ure and well-ordered cove|nant. &mdash; The great GOD was his GOD; his guide thro' life; his &s;upport in death; and when his fle&s;h &amp; heart fail'd him his unchange|able friend and portion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003640_0014_100316AA4BCB8418">BUT,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> HE was an I&s;raelite indeed, <HI>in whom was no guile.</HI> An <HI>I&s;raelite indeed</HI> was his <HI>general</HI> character, wherein he agreed with good men in common: but that more &s;pecial glory of a good man, his being without guile, &s;eems to have been that wherein he excell'd.</P>
<P>HE was <HI>without guile,</HI> the phra&s;e mu&s;t not be taken ab&s;olutely: for in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, it can be applied to none but the perfect|ly holy JESUS, of whom 'tis te&s;tified, that <HI>he did no &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth.</HI> But the meaning of it is, that guile had not a predominant reigning influence over his heart or life: and not only &s;o, but it may be expre&s;&s;ive of the peculiar turn of his mind as open, plain and &s;incere; without de|ceit, craft and hypocri&s;ie: which natural tem|per as &s;anctified and improved by divine grace, he was enabled to exerci&s;e upon religious prin|ciples and views, and in an uncommon degree, both towards GOD and <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>HE was <HI>without guile</HI> in regard of the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> GOD. That is to &s;ay, he was a man of undi&s;&s;embled piety; a true wor&s;hipper of the true GOD; &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and in reality what he pretended to be. Deceit and hypocri&s;ie were contrary to the very bent of his mind, and above all things abhorrent to him, as terminated upon the heart &s;earching GOD. He did not take up religion
<PB N="9" REF="003640_0015_100316B65873C7E8">
as an outward form; he did not put it on for a cloak or di&s;gui&s;e; he did not practice it out of meer fa&s;hion, to fall in with the cu&s;tom of the people among whom he liv'd: but he had a real regard for the honour of GOD, and was heartily concerned to recommend him&s;elf to the divine &s;avour.</P>
<P>HIS chief aim was not to make a &s;plendid outward &s;hew, to appear externally religious, while he was inwardly full of hypocri&s;y and iniquity: but he was one that &s;incerely lov'd the day, the hou&s;e and wor&s;hip of GOD; and was a con&s;tant, diligent and exemplary attendant on it; and this we may &s;uppo&s;e not only in publick, in the more open view of men; but more privately in his family, &s;tatedly &s;erving the LORD with his hou&s;ehold; and &s;ecretly in his clo&s;et, when he had no witne&s;&s; but GOD and his own &s;oul.</P>
<P>NOR did he &s;atisfie him&s;elf with meer outward expre&s;&s;ions of piety and devotion. He was chiefly concerned about the inward frame of his mind; and accordingly was one who: heartily lov'd and fear'd GOD: His tru&s;t in him; his belief of him; his dependance upon him; his re&s;ignation and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him, were all unaffected and without di&s;imu|lation</P>
<P>THUS was he a man of <HI>real</HI> piety; without di&s;gui&s;e or deceit; of no prevailing <HI>guile</HI> re&s;pecting his <HI>maker.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003640_0016_100316B9683D3948">HE was al&s;o <HI>without guile</HI> in regard of <HI>man.</HI> By which we are to under&s;tand "<HI>The &s;inglene&s;s of his heart, di&s;covering it&s;elf in a con&s;tant plainne&s;s and hone&s;t openne&s;s of &s;peech and behaviour</HI>".</P>
<P>DECEIT and flattery were an abomination to him. He dealt not in empty compliments; meer pretences of love and friend&s;hip, cheating tho&s;e he converted with, with a &s;hew of kind|ne&s;s, when he realy intended none towards him; but his profe&s;&s;ions in this kind were &s;incere, and might with &s;afety be depended upon. He was not an enemy in his heart; yet a fawning, deceitfull flatterer with his tongue: and what is not &s;o very common, it might be known by his words and actions, whom he vallued, when he was a friend, and to how great a degree</P>
<P>He was not given to craft; and made no use of little tricks &amp; fetches, to deceive others, and lead them into a wrong judgment of him. He form'd no de&s;ign he took pains to mi&s;repre|&s;ent; he engaged in no affair, he made u&s;e of &s;ecret managements to conceal, or deceitful di&s;gui&s;es to put a good glo&s;s upon: but his actions were plain and above board; his con|duct without intreigue, and tho&s;e winding cunning devices, that often render men's be|haviour ob&s;cure and unintelligable.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003640_0017_100316BB068CC200">HE was an implacable enemy to all lying, equivocating, and cra&s;tily impo&s;ing either up|on the credulity or weakne&s;s of others, to the mi&s;leading or abu&s;ing them; was true to his promi&s;e, punctual to his engagements; and in one word, never liv'd under di&s;gui&s;e; never walk't in an empty &s;hew, making a fal&s;e ap|pearance of what he was not: but realy was what he pretended to be; did what he profe&s;s'd to do; and con&s;tantly took care to make his words and actions, and their true meaning, keep peace with each other.</P>

to men: they have no de&s;ign to &s;erve their maker, but u&s;e religion as a cloak to &s;erve them&s;elves.</P>
<P>TO &s;uch I can't help &s;aying,</P>
<P>O con&s;ider! &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the dreadful &s;olly of thus treating the infinitely holy GOD! <HI>He &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth! but his eyes are like a flame of fire,</HI> piercing into the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the heart: nor is there a thought there, but lo! he knoweth it altogether. &mdash; Our very &s;ouls are as vi&s;ible to him, as our bodies; &mdash; and he con&s;tantly views them, and is perfectly acquainted with their mo&s;t inward frame and temper; with all their views and purpo&s;es, their motions &amp; tendencies. That's the &s;tile in which the glorious GOD is &s;poken of in the &s;criptures, <HI>the LORD &s;earcheth all hearts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I Chron. 28.9.</NOTE>. Yea, he him&s;elf &s;peaks of an <HI>in&s;pec|tion</HI> into <HI>humane hearts,</HI> as a glory that di&s;|tingui&s;hingly belongs to him, <HI>I the LORD &s;earch the heart, I try the reins</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. I7.I0.</NOTE>. What &s;tupidity then is it to plea&s;e our&s;elves with the thought of cheating our <HI>Maker</HI> with guile and hypocri&s;y? Surely our GOD is not a man that we can impo&s;e upon him! We are all open and naked before him, and let the mask we have on be what it will, he neverthele&s;s beholds us as we really are. And while we are flatter|ing him with our lips, or deceiving him with
<PB N="14" REF="003640_0020_100316C6E77A3768">
a fal&s;e &s;hew, &s;hou'd not the thought, that he has &s;ecret ca&s;ement into our brea&s;t, through which every thing appears in its true light, dreadfully &s;hock and aba&s;e us? If we would allow our &s;elves only to reali&s;e this, hypocri&s;y would appear the height of folly; and of all Per&s;ons we &s;hou'd be the mo&s;t a&s;hamed of our&s;elves, and cover'd with confu&s;ion, when we have dealt deceitfully with GOD.</P>
<P>BUT it may be our aim is, to gain a repu|tation among men, for our piety and devotion: <HI>all our works we do, for to be &s;een of men</HI>; to be applauded and commended by them. But &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hou'd compa&s;s this de&s;ign; what is it more than plea&s;ing our &s;elves with vanity, if we are gratified with others &s;peaking well of us, while at the &s;ame time we are con|&s;cious to our &s;elves, 'tis be&s;ide what we de&s;erve. Others applauding our piety can't alter our real character: we &s;hall notwith&s;tanding re|main the &s;ame per&s;ons. And if when we are commended for our &s;incerity, we know in our own hearts that we are full of hypocri&s;y and guile, what have we to value our &s;elves for? And in&s;tead of being plea&s;ed, have we not ra|ther infinite rea&s;on for blu&s;hing, to think of our having mock'd GOD, to impo&s;e upon men?</P>
<P>AND the folly we are chargeable with, is exceedingly aggravated, if we con&s;ider the pains we mu&s;t be at, to obtain this end, which
<PB N="15" REF="003640_0021_100316CA23796FA8">
has really nothing of worth in it. We mu&s;t do every thing, at lea&s;t in appearance, which a good man does; mu&s;t attend the wor&s;hip and ordinances of the go&s;pel; mu&s;t &s;how re|&s;pect to the day and hou&s;e of GOD; mu&s;t be exact in the performance of all the external duties of religion: and not only &s;o, but mu&s;t have a con&s;tant guard upon our&s;elves, le&s;t we let drop our mask &amp; di&s;cover our hypocri&s;y. And in the doing of this, what pains mu&s;t we be at? perhaps much greater than need be u&s;ed by men of real &s;incerity: for they are prompted to all they do, from a principle of love to GOD and his &s;ervice; which makes every thing natural, and &s;o ea&s;ie and plea&s;ant. Whereas what we do being counterfeit, every thing is a burden; and we mu&s;t be in perpe|tual u&s;e of caution, or our guile will di&s;clo&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOW what greater argument of folly, than our putting our &s;elves to &s;o much pains and trouble, to &s;o little purpo&s;e? e&s;pecially if it be added, that the &s;ame pains if rightly man|aged, would in all probability, turn to our un&s;peakable advantage; the eternal &s;alvation of our &s;ouls. For 'tis a mo&s;t certain truth, that a per&s;on would be under the mo&s;t hope|full pro&s;pect of getting to heaven, if he took as much pains for it, as &s;ome men do to make a meer &s;hew of being religious.</P>

'Tis ju&s;t matter of complaint, "that &s;incerity and plainne&s;s are almo&s;t out of fa&s;hion; and that the greate&s;t part of the conver&s;ation of man|kind, and of their intercour&s;e with one ano|ther, is little el&s;e but driving a trade of di&s;&s;i|mulation". How common are the &s;ins of flattery and deceit; di&s;covered in the mo&s;t lavi&s;h preten&s;ions to love, and friend&s;hip, and a di&s;tingui&s;hing re&s;pect, when there is little or nothing in the heart to an&s;wer the true intent of our words; in&s;omuch that "our language is running into a lie, the u&s;e of &s;peech almo&s;t perverted, and words made to &s;ignifie noth|ing". What tricking is made u&s;e of? what crafty, underhand, fly, in&s;inuating manage|ments, in our trade and commerce with each other? And how often is there a contradiction between our hearts and tongues in our engagements to one another? How many allow them&s;elves in making promi&s;es, they have no intention to perform? and that they forget as &s;oon as they have made?</P>
<P>BUT certainly tis a vile &s;hame it &s;hould be thus. Let us remember; the GOD that made us, and to whom we are accountable, is
<PB N="18" REF="003640_0024_100305429D3B17E0">
a GOD of truth. He never made u&s;e of guile towards his creatures, in any of his deal|ings with them, or declarations to them: but has always been plain and open; treating us with perfect &s;incerity, an ab&s;olute freedom from deceit. And as we are herein capable, in &s;ome good mea&s;ure, of imitating the copy he has &s;et us; &s;o tis his expectation that we do &s;o. And 'twill be an eternal reproach to us, if we are unlike him, practi&s;ing di&s;&s;imulation, fal&s;e|hood and guile. Nor in this ca&s;e, may we call our&s;elves his children. For tho&s;e that are <HI>born again, not of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of GOD</HI>; are his children by re&s;emblance of him, in this moral part of his glory. And 'tis a &s;ad mark of our being the children of another father, even the father of guile and deceit, if this wicked di&s;|po&s;ition of his rule in us; and we make it our practice to act contrary to the great law of integrity, in our treatment of one another.</P>
<P>AND as we call our &s;elves <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> how ill does it become us to allow our &s;elves in the exerci&s;e of deceit and guile? to flatter and cajole? and make u&s;e of the ba&s;e arts of fraud and cunning in our dealings with each other? how contrary is this, to the temper and conduct of the <HI>&s;incere Je&s;us, in who&s;e mouth was no guile.</HI> And with what im|propriety, in this ca&s;e are we called after his name, and denominated his di&s;ciples?</P>

<P>BUT 'tis time I now proceed,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> TO <HI>call upon us all</HI> to &s;ee to it, that we be <HI>men of &s;incerity; free from guile,</HI> both towards GOD and <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. LET us be <HI>&s;incere towards GOD</HI>: ma|king con&s;cience of keeping our &s;elves, as much as po&s;&s;ible, free from that di&s;&s;embling with the Almighty; which is &s;o common in the world; and what we are all prone to, and apt to make too light of.</P>
<P>In order whereto,</P>
<P>LET us beware of taking more pains to <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be religious, then to be <HI>really</HI> &s;o. Thus tis with the Hypocrite. His concern is not &s;o much to be truly <HI>godly,</HI> as to <HI>appear</HI> to be &s;o: and therefore his pains in religion are chiefly calculated to this end; which if he can but obtain, he de&s;ires nothing more. But let us on the contrary, as we would approve our&s;elves men of &s;incerity, be concerned to be in truth pious towards GOD, and not meerly to make others think we are. Let us be careful to keep iniquity out of our hearts, as well as to hide it from the view of men. And let our pains in religion be chiefly intended, to plea&s;e GOD and recommend our+&s;elves
<PB N="21" REF="003640_0027_10031678C7749D78">
to his favour, and not terminate in gaining credit among our fellow creatures &mdash;.</P>
<P>ALSO, let us take heed of minding <HI>only</HI> the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> of duty, not regarding our <HI>in|ward &s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>feeling</HI> in the performance of it. The man of guile concerns him&s;elf only with the externals of piety, not at all regard|ing his heart. He wor&s;hips GOD outwardly, but has no inward reverence or e&s;teem for him. If the duty be but done, no matter how, or in what manner. Let us therefore, if we would have upon our&s;elves the &s;ymptoms of &s;incerity, regard our hearts, as well as the ex|ternal performance of duty. Let us, when we engage in the outward part of religion, take care that our &s;ouls be &s;utably affected; and not make it a matter of meer form and ceremony. Let us inwardly honour GOD, when we outwardly wor&s;hip him, not &s;uffer|ing our hearts to be remov'd far away from him. And let it be our great concern, when we pray to GOD, or do any other duty more im|mediately relating to him, to experience with in our&s;elves the workings of love, fear, hope, faith or joy; not contenting our&s;elves, unle&s;s we have &s;ome motion of &s;oul towards him.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, let us beware of re&s;training our&s;elves, in the ob&s;ervance of the duties of pie|ty, to tho&s;e only that are to be performed before others. This is the way of the Hypocrite: He limits his regards to tho&s;e ob&s;ervances that
<PB N="22" REF="003640_0028_1003167BC3C0E060">
may be &s;een of men; neglecting tho&s;e that are &s;ecret, and to be perform'd only between GOD and his own &s;oul. But let us as an evidence of our &s;incerity, extend our care to the whole of duty; ob&s;erving tho&s;e parts of it that are &s;ecret, as well as tho&s;e that are more open. Let us do the duties of the clo&s;et, as well as tho&s;e of the family, and hou&s;e of GOD; and uni|ver&s;ally make con&s;cience of tho&s;e performan|ces that are hid from men, as well as tho&s;e that are mo&s;t within their view.</P>
<P>IN fine, let us take heed of being govern'd in our piety; by carnal views and motives; making u&s;e of religion like the hypocrite, as a cloak for our coveteou&s;ne&s;s, or &s;ome how or other, ba&s;ely to &s;erve our &s;elves: But let us engage in it upon &s;utable motives; an inward feeling of the beauty and loveline&s;s of it; &mdash; a real regard for the honour of GOD;&mdash;an over-powering &s;en&s;e of the divine authority, and the inviolable bonds of love and gratitude, we are under to GOD and the Redeemer. &mdash; And let our aims be true go&s;pel ones. Let us have a view to our &s;elves, <HI>i.e.</HI> our own true&s;t intere&s;t, the future glorious recompence of reward. &mdash; But above all, let us eye the glory of GOD; making that the ruling ultimate end of all that we do in religion.</P>
<P>THUS let us be &s;incere with GOD. Tis what he really de&s;ires at our hands. P&s;al. 5I.6. <HI>Thou de&s;ire&s;t truth in the inward parts.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="003640_0029_10031680B02C7178">

<P>MOREOVER, &s;incerity is of ea&s;ie practice- <Q>It is always con&s;istent with it&s;elf, and needs nothing to help it out: it is always near at hand, and &s;its upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware.</Q> There is no trouble in the exerci&s;e of it. &mdash; It needs no contrivance, no pains to di&s;gui&s;e or con|ceal it. &mdash; We have nothing to do, but to act according to the real &s;entiments of our minds.&mdash;</P>
<P>IN fine, the con&s;tant practice of this virtue will give us boldne&s;s before the SON of MAN,
<PB N="26" REF="003640_0032_10031687467FD180">
in that <HI>day,</HI> when every di&s;gui&s;e &s;hall be plucked off, and every man appear ju&s;t as he is: when <HI>the &s;ecrets of men &s;hall be judged; and GOD will bring every work into judgment, and every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING now remains, but to take &s;ome proper notice of the occa&s;ion, of my bringing you &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e at this time: the <HI>Death</HI> of that <HI>Aged</HI> and <HI>Honourable</HI> per&s;on, who&s;e <HI>Funeral,</HI> we were, the la&s;t week, called to attend.</P>
<P>IT would be a great incongruity, ju&s;t after a &s;olemn di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t guile and in&s;inceri|ty, if I &s;hou'd allow my&s;elf, in &s;aying any thing, either to flatter the dead, or deceive the living: and I think, I &s;o far know my&s;elf, as to be a&s;&s;ur'd, while thus &s;tanding in the pre&s;ence of a holy GOD, I dare not attempt a repre&s;entation, I had rea&s;on to believe was not true and faithfull.</P>
<P>I do not &s;peak of him, as free from infir|mities. For who among men can pretend to be without fault? <HI>If thou, O LORD &s;hould'&s;t mark iniquities: O Lord, who &s;hall &s;tand</HI>? The very be&s;t of us have rea&s;on, to make that acknowledgment, <HI>Who can under&s;tand his errors</HI>? And to breath out the following prayer, <HI>Clean&s;e thou me from &s;ecret faults.</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="003640_0033_1003168CED09FFB0">
YET I may with all freedom &s;ay, He was <HI>an I&s;raelite indeed</HI>; <HI>a good Man, a real Chri&s;tian.</HI> Nor will it be denied, that freedom from <HI>guile</HI> was one thing, for which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed In regard of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, his <HI>piety</HI> was undi&s;&s;embled: which he di&s;co|vered in a flaming zeal for his honour; a con&s;tant exemplary regard to his wor&s;hip both in the <HI>clo&s;et,</HI> the <HI>family,</HI> and the place of GOD's pre&s;ence: where he &s;et a good pat|tern of unaffected devotion, in his ob&s;ervance of <HI>all</HI> the in&s;titutions of the LORD JESUS. And in regard of <HI>men,</HI> few had their conver|&s;ation more free, from that winding of the &s;erpent; that flattery and deceit; that craft, &s;huffling and double dealing, that is &s;o common among men. &mdash; But I have no need to in&s;i&s;t here, not doubting, your tho'ts were up|on <HI>our</HI> NATHANAEL, while I was re|pre&s;enting the <HI>character</HI> in the <HI>text</HI>: the application was so easie and obvious; and I would hope, unexceptionable: having carefully avoided &s;aying any thing, but what I tho't in ju&s;tice belonged to him.</P>
<P>BUT tho' his open temper, and &s;incerely plain and undi&s;gui&s;ed manner of life, was that wherein he excelled: yet were there other things in him, which ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Father of Sprits</HI> was plea&s;ed to form within him a &s;oul, much beyond the
<PB N="28" REF="003640_0034_1003168E6FA203F8">
common &s;ize: furni&s;h'd with large capacities; a good under&s;tanding, a quick apprehen&s;ion, a &s;olid judgment: all which being join'd with a happy turn of mind, well fitted him for the many po&s;ts of honour, heaven de&s;ign'd him for, and he was afterwards, in the &s;everal periods of his life, fixed in.</P>
<P>HE was of an extraordinary active, vigo|rous &s;pirit; and of &s;uch great natural courage that he never fear'd taking upon him, any &s;ervice, he was call'd to in providence: and &s;uch was the firmne&s;s of his mind, that no man could better bare up under difficulties and di&s;couragements. They &s;carce made any im|pre&s;&s;ion upon him; till they came to lie &s;o heavy, as to &s;ink the &s;pirits of mo&s;t other men.</P>
<P>HE was well form'd for government: his &s;peech, his behaviour, his very looks; e&s;peci|ally as joyn'd with a happy talent of turning them this way, were adapted to command re|&s;pect and reverence. He had him&s;elf a great veneration for authority, and a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ed|ne&s;s to promote the &s;ame in others: was a lover of good order; in maintaining of which, his zeal and care were particularly commend|able, in the OEconomy of his family: where every thing was managed with the nice&s;t ex|actne&s;s; every one moving in a known &s;phere, with a becoming decency and regularity: more e&s;pecially in that part of his life, when
<PB N="29" REF="003640_0035_100316980D489AB0">
his bu&s;ine&s;s requir'd a numerous train of &s;ervants.</P>
<P>He was one of good elocution: could &s;peak well; with propriety and fluency. And per|haps few, on a &s;udden, could expre&s;s them&s;elves with more pertinency; greater freedom, con|nection or clearne&s;s.</P>
<P>HE was of a catholick &s;pirit: not confin'd in his charity within the limits of a party; but heartily lov'd and honour'd all good men, however differing from him in matters of le&s;s importance. He greatly de&s;ired the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the&s;e churches, and their abound|ing in the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s; as being of their profe&s;s'd principles, and preferring their manner of wor&s;hip: yet was he far from placing religion in any <HI>particular form,</HI> either of <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> or <HI>di&s;cipline</HI>; believing with the great Apo&s;tle, that <HI>the kingdom of GOD is not meat and drink; but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the</HI> HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>HE was upon principle, a man of charity; had &s;eriou&s;ly weighed the obligations to this duty, and the proper mea&s;ure in which it ought to be exerci&s;ed: and according to his be&s;t judg|ment had form'd a <HI>rule</HI> to him&s;elf, which for <HI>for|ty years,</HI> he inviolably kept to: con&s;tantly paying (for that was the phra&s;e he was wont to u&s;e) &s;uch a proportion out of his e&s;tate; which whatever it was ordinarily, it once hap|pened, within <HI>my knowledge,</HI> in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="30" REF="003640_0036_1003169AC559FEC0">
one year, to amount to &s;ome hundreds of pounds: with which, together with his other di&s;tributi|ons, he often times refre&s;h'd both the souls and bodies of many, that were in want. 'Twas his principle to do what he did, this way, in the time of his life; and therefore if he has not by his la&s;t will, made many charitable donati|ons, he herein only acted according to his known &s;ettled Judgment.</P>
<P>HE had upon his mind an uncommon con|viction of the reality of invi&s;ible things, and a future &s;tate. Nor did I ever &s;ee the man, that was more free from the remains of unbelief; that had a more uniform, &s;teady and un&s;haken faith, in the <HI>Go&s;pel Revelation.</HI> He never &s;eem'd to waver or doubt; but was po&s;&s;e&s;t of a con&s;tant, firm belief of the things of GOD and another world. And he had the comfort of it, in the various changes and pa&s;&s;ages of his life; but e&s;pecially at the time of his death: in the view of which, he was under no manner of fear; but &s;eem'd perfectly re&s;ign'd to his Maker: free and willing, at GOD's call, to go away into eternity. And the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, was what &s;upported him; a lively hope in the mercy of GOD, thro' a glorious Redeemer: And in the &s;trong exerci&s;e of this hope and faith, his <HI>body</HI> fell <HI>a&s;leep in</HI> JESUS, while his <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> we tru&s;t, was re|ceiv'd to <HI>the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect.</HI></P>
<P>WE now heartily joyn, in lifting up our prayer to the GOD who dwelleth in the
<PB N="31" REF="003640_0037_1003169C47E2D450">
heavens, that &s;howers of divine ble&s;&s;ings may de&s;cend upon the <HI>children's children</HI>! &mdash;And may you &s;incerely chu&s;e your <HI>father's</HI> and <HI>grand-father's</HI> GOD, for your GOD! So will he be your never-failing friend &amp; all-&s;ufficient portion. &mdash;</P>
<P>AND may the breaches which a righteous GOD is making in this church of our LORD JESUS, whereby he is thinning our glory, and weakening our &s;trength, be happily repair'd! And let there be no rea&s;on for that complaint, <HI>the righteous peri&s;heth, and no man layeth it to heart.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>AND as our aged venerable fathers go off the &s;tage, O holy LORD GOD, <HI>pour out thy &s;pirit from on high,</HI> upon the <HI>Sons</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND, that they may be qua|lified to adorn and fill up their places! &mdash; that we may have <HI>our Judges as at the fir&s;t,</HI> and <HI>our Councillors as at the be|ginning</HI>; all our <HI>Officers peace,</HI> and <HI>our Exact|ors righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>O revive thy work in the mid&s;t of the&s;e declining years! that we may do that which is right in the &s;ight of the <HI>LORD,</HI> accord|ing to all that our fathers have done before us. &mdash; <HI>Let us yet remain</HI> thy people! &mdash; <HI>So &s;hall</HI> glory dwell in our land.</P>

<P>ON the 6th of this In&s;tant, between the hours of 1 &amp; 2 in the Morning, died at his Hou&s;e here, after about a Month's Langui&s;h|ment, the Honourable <HI>NATHANAEL BYFIELD</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in the 80th year of his Age: Having long been a great Ornament both of our Church and State.</P>
<P>His immediate De&s;cent was from the Rev. Mr. RICHARD BYFIELD, the laborious faithful <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> of <HI>Long-Ditton,</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and one of the <HI>Divines</HI> in the famous <HI>We&s;t|mini&s;ter-A&s;&s;embly</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI> it appears, He was one of the <HI>ejected</HI> Mini&s;ters, and the <HI>olde&s;t,</HI> in that <HI>County</HI> in which he liv'd, that was ejected; that he afterwards retired to <HI>Mortlack,</HI> where he u&s;ually preached <HI>twice</HI> every LORD's Day, in his own Family, and did &s;o the very LORD's Day before his Death. &mdash; He further &s;peaks of him as a Man, of great Piety, Zeal and exemplary Holine&s;s of Conver&s;ation; and as falling a&s;leep in the LORD, in <HI>December</HI> I664, <HI>Aetat.</HI> 67. I may add to this account, that the <HI>Living</HI> he was turned out of, was worth 400 a yearSterling: His leaving of which, for ea&s;e to his Con&s;cience, was a good &s;ign of his having a real hone&s;t Heart.</NOTE>: His <HI>Mother</HI> being of

the noted Family of the JUXON's. He was the younge&s;t of <HI>one and twenty</HI> Children; and one of the <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> that have &s;ometimes followed their pious Father to the Place of publick Wor&s;hip. He was born in I653; arrived at BOSTON in <HI>New-England</HI> in I674; and conceiving a Love to this Coun|try, re&s;olved to &s;ettle here: and accordingly married the following Year to Mrs. DEBO|RAH CLARKE, by whom he had five chil|dren: three whereof died in Infancy, the o|ther two lived to be Married, the younge&s;t to the late Honourable <HI>Lieutenant Governour</HI> TAILER, who quickly departed without I&s;&s;ue; the other to EDWARD LYDE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> by whom &s;he had five Children: Two of whom dying young, three only are now &s;ur|viving, a Son and two Daughters.</P>
<P>He was formerly a noted <HI>Merchant</HI> in this Place; and &s;oon after PHILLIPS's <HI>War,</HI> had the Honour to be One of the <HI>four</HI> Proprietors, and the principal Settler of the Town of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; where he lived their Head &amp; Glory 'till the Year 1724; when his advancing Age put him upon returning back to BOSTON, the Place of his fir&s;t Settlement; and where he remain'd 'till he died.</P>
<P><HI>Few</HI> have pa&s;&s;ed thro' a greater variety of Scenes in publick Life. In the <HI>Field</HI> he quickly arrived to One of the highe&s;t Places of Power. In the <HI>State,</HI> he was Honour'd

with many Betru&s;tments; was in Commi&s;&s;ion for the Peace, and Judge of Probates; was &s;everal Times cho&s;en <HI>Speaker</HI> in the Honou|rable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; fat CHIEF <HI>thirty eight</HI> years in the Court of General Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace, and Common Pleas for the County of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> as afterwards he did <HI>two</HI> years for the County of <HI>Su&s;&s;olk</HI>; was One of His MAJESTY'S <HI>Council</HI> for this Province a great Number of years; and had the Honour of receiving five &s;everal Commi&s;&s;ions for Judge of the Vice-Admiralty, from three <HI>Crowned Heads,</HI> from <HI>King</HI> WILLIAM in 1697, from <HI>Queen</HI> ANNE in the years 1702, 1703, and 1709, and from <HI>King</HI> GEORGE the Second, in 1728. He was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Judge under our pre&s;ent Charter; and never Once had a Decree revers'd upon an Appeal Home.</P>
<P><HI>For his Character. &mdash; Ju&s;tice to his Me|mory requires it &s;hould be &s;aid,</HI>&mdash; He was greatly valued and honoured by tho&s;e ac|quainted with him, for his &s;uperiour Genius and Abilities; his great natural Courage, Vigour and Activity; his plain, unaffected, shearful and in&s;tructive way of Conver&s;ation; his catholic Spirit; his real Integrity, and unque&s;tionable Faithfulne&s;s and Hone&s;ty; his Zeal again&s;t Sin, and to maintain public Peace and good Order; his &s;trict Regard to the Wor&s;hip of GOD, and con&s;tant, devout and exemplary Attendance on it, both in Public and Private; and in one word, his
