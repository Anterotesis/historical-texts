<HEAD>THE INSTITUTION OF THE Humane Society OF THE Commonwealth of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM a variety of faithful experiments, and inconte&s;tible facts, it is now con&s;idered as an e&s;tabli&s;hed truth, that the total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the vital functions in the animal body is by no means incompatible with life; and con&s;equently, the marks of apparent death may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without any nece&s;&s;ary implication of an ab&s;olute extinction of the animating principle.</P>
<P>The boundary line between life and death, or the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;igns of the latter, are objects to which the utmo&s;t efforts of the human capacity have never yet attained. Nor can we, with any degree of certainty, pronounce, that an animal is dead, until the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs of putre|faction have been furni&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021157_0004_0FB24CA579FA4130">From the&s;e facts it might rea&s;onably be ex|pected, that, were proper mea&s;ures to be adopted, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es peculiarly doubtful, we might frequently be enabled to re&s;tore to full life, and the enjoyment of it, a beloved friend, or a valuable member of &s;ociety. And indeed, numerous &s;uc|ce&s;sful in&s;tances might be adduced in the ca&s;es of per&s;ons, who would in a few hours have been con|&s;igned to an untimely grave; and perhaps have &s;uffered all the horrors of inevitable death, attended with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own terrible &s;ituation.</P>
<P>It is not, however, to be under&s;tood, that any proce&s;s, directed to the above-mentioned purpo&s;e, can be equally applicable to all ca&s;es. For as the attempt mu&s;t pre&s;uppo&s;e an entire &s;tate of the vital organs, it is obvious that tho&s;e apparent deaths, which are con&s;equent upon di&s;ea&s;e, afford, in ge|neral, little or no encouragement for &s;uch attempts. But in mo&s;t ca&s;es of &s;udden death, the vital organs appear to have &s;u&s;tained but a very &s;light injury, and only require a &s;ea&s;onable excitement of the heart to renew their action.</P>
<P>The exqui&s;ite feelings attendant on the unex|pected re&s;toration of an affectionate friend, or an indulgent parent, a dutiful child, or an intimate companion of our bo&s;oms, after having been &s;ud|denly torn from us, and in imagination numbered with the dead, may be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed. Nor is the acqui&s;ition of one de&s;erving member of &s;ociety an object unworthy the public attention.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="021157_0005_0FB24CAC2D052580">Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;ocieties have been formed in various parts of Europe for promoting attempts to recover per&s;ons from apparent death, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of &s;uffocation and drowning. The Humane Society e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great-Britain, in 1774. has been very &s;ucce&s;sful. Within ten years from its in&s;titution, out of 1300 per&s;ons apparently dead from drowning, 790 have been re&s;tored to their friends and country. Many of them, no doubt, u&s;eful and valuable men.</P>
<P>For an in&s;titution of this nature a con&s;iderable fund is nece&s;&s;ary. And many occa&s;ional expences will un|avoidably occur. The cau&s;e of humanity, however, de&s;erves every encouragement. And to promote that cau&s;e, it is to be hoped the benevolent will liberally &s;ub&s;cribe.</P>
<P>A Society is now formed for the&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es in this Commonwealth: And the follow|ing plan and arrangements are &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the publick.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>THOUGH the following Methods are chiefly adapted to ca&s;es of apparent death from <HI>drowning,</HI> yet the Society think it proper to ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of the means of re&s;toration herein recom|mended are applicable to a con&s;iderable variety of other ca&s;es, &s;uch as hanging, convul&s;ion fits, &s;uffocation by damps, or noxious vapours, the confined air of wells, ci&s;terns, caves, or the mu&s;t of fermenting liquors.&mdash;The Society have in &s;ome of the more e&s;&s;ential articles of treatment, fol|lowed the recommendations of foreign Societies of a &s;imilar nature; they have however endea|voured to render them more conformable to the particular circum&s;tances of this country.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>METHODS of Treatment to be u&s;ed with Per&s;ons apparently dead from drowning.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE unfortunate per&s;on is to be conveyed carefully to the neare&s;t hou&s;e: For this pur|po&s;e the head is to be rai&s;ed a little, as in bed, and the body &s;hould be carried in a natural and ea&s;y po&s;ture.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Subject is to be immediately &s;tripped, and laid on a warm bed, and the <HI>&s;kin</HI> well dried with heated flannels, the mud and froth to be removed from the mouth and no&s;trils; if the body was naked at the time of the accident, it is then to be &s;urround|ed as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible with a hot blanket, and thoroughly dried with coar&s;e cloths or flannels.</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;moke of tobacco thrown up the funda|ment &s;hould be ranked among the earlie&s;t applications: If a <HI>fumigator</HI> &s;hould not be at hand, the common
<PB N="12" REF="021157_0010_0FB24CC25E74B8F0">
pipe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the common Pipe is u&s;ed, the &s;moke is to be blown with the mouth from the bowl, through the &s;tem, into the fundament, covering the bowl with a handkerchief, or thin piece of linen.</NOTE> will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of applying this vapour to the bowels. So ea&s;y and important an operation &s;hould be repeatedly performed, as the good effects of tobacco &s;moke have been proved in many ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The &s;kin is to be gently rubbed with warm woollen cloths, and a warming pan heated (the body being &s;urrounded with flannel) may lightly be moved up and down the back for a con&s;iderable time. Wooden bottles filled with hot water, &amp;c. or <HI>heated bricks,</HI> covered with flannel&punc; may be effica|ciou&s;ly applied to the &s;oles of the feet, palms of the hands, and other parts of the body.</P>
<P N="5">V. If a child has been drowned, its body &s;hould be wiped perfectly dry, and immediately placed in bed between two per&s;ons of good con&s;titution; the &s;alutary effects of the natural vital warmth have been clearly proved in a variety of &s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The body is to be rubbed with flannels, &s;prinkled with &s;pirits, and fomentations of hot rum are to be applied to the brea&s;t, &amp;c. and often renew|ed. The no&s;trils may be every now and then tickled with a feather; <HI>&s;nuff</HI> and <HI>volatiles</HI> &s;hould be occa|&s;ionally made u&s;e of, to excite &s;neezing if po&s;&s;ible. The various means of recovery &s;hould be made u&s;e of by the <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tants</HI> for &s;everal hours, the body is to be gently &s;haken every ten minutes, in order to render the proce&s;s more certainly &s;ucce&s;sful; and the bodies of <HI>Children</HI> in particular are to be agitated, by taking hold of their arms and legs frequently, and for a continuance of time. In a variety of in|&s;tances
<PB N="13" REF="021157_0011_0FB24CC39384CBB0">
agitation, in conjunction with the methods laid down, has forwarded the recovery of boys who had been drowned, and continued for a con&s;iderable time apparently dead.</P>
<P N="7">VII. If there be any &s;igns of returning life, &s;uch as &s;ighing, ga&s;ping, convul&s;ive motions, pul&s;ation or a natural warmth, a &s;ponful of any warm liquid may be admini&s;tered; and if it proves that the power of &s;wallowing is returned, then a cordial draught may be given in &s;mall quantities, but not without the direction of a Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. When the air is very <HI>cold</HI> or <HI>moi&s;t,</HI> the various methods of treatment are to be made u&s;e of <HI>near a large fire,</HI> or in a <HI>heated</HI> apartment. On the other hand, if the weather is <HI>warm,</HI> or <HI>&s;ultry</HI> (as in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on) the windows and doors of the room &s;hould be opened; and in every other po&s;&s;ible way a cool refre&s;hing air obtained; as it is of the greate&s;t importance in bringing forward the latent &s;park of life, or in re&s;toring natural breathing.</P>
<P N="9">IX. No per&s;ons are to be admitted into the room, but tho&s;e who are actually employed in exerting their utmo&s;t endeavours for the recovery of the unfor|tunate; &s;ix per&s;ons are therefore the greate&s;t number that can ever prove u&s;eful on &s;uch occa&s;ions; and tho&s;e who are by-&s;tanders for the &s;ake of curio&s;ity &s;hould be reque&s;ted to withdraw, as their pre&s;ence may retard or totally prevent the re&s;toration.</P>
<P><HI>Bleeding is never to be employed in &s;uch ca&s;es, unle&s;s by the direction of one of the Medical A&s;&s;i&s;tants, or &s;ome other re&s;pectable gentleman of the faculty, who has paid attention to &s;uch unfortunate accidents.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="021157_0012_0FB24CCB01263C38">The methods which have been &s;o fully recom|mended, are to be made u&s;e of with vigour for &s;everal hours, although no favourable circum&s;tances &s;hould ari&s;e; for it is a vulgar and dangerous opinion to &s;uppo&s;e that per&s;ons are irrecoverable, becau&s;e life does not &s;oon make its appearance; and upon this opinion, an immen&s;e number of the &s;eemingly dead have been committed to the grave; who might have been RESTORED TO LIFE by <HI>re&s;olution</HI> and <HI>per&s;everance</HI> in the plans of treatment now re|commended.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="methods of treatment">
<HEAD>Methods to be u&s;ed for the Recovery of Per&s;ons frozen.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE body of a per&s;on chilled with the Cold, apparently lifele&s;s&punc; is to be carefully examin|ed, and if the limbs are not &s;tiffened, if there is any degree of warmth remaining about the brea&s;t or in the armpits, it may be proper to attempt the Recovery, e&s;pecially if any motion is perceivable by putting the hand upon the heart.</P>
<P N="2">II. The body is to be placed under cover, but not near a fire.&mdash;&mdash;Nothing hot is to be applied to any parts of the body; to the &s;oles of the feet, how|ever, <HI>warm</HI> bricks may be applied with &s;afety.</P>
<P N="3">III. The body is to be gently rubbed with a woollen cloth, or with a warm hand, e&s;pecially about the brea&s;t and along the back bone.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Tobacco &s;moke is to be blown into the fundament from a lighted tobacco pipe, if conve|nient, warm cly&s;ters &s;hould al&s;o be injected, and if &s;ymptoms of recovery are then apparent, a

little weak wine and water may be given moderately warmed, but no &s;trong &s;pirits nor any thing el&s;e is to be given that may have a tendency &s;uddenly to in|crea&s;e the circulation of the blood, as every thing of that kind mu&s;t at this &s;tage of the recovery prove very injurious.</P>

<P>AN ingenious and very u&s;eful Communication on the &s;ubject of <HI>Re&s;toration from apparent Death,</HI> has been received from Mr. Jonathan Williams of Bo&s;ton, from which, as an encouragement for exertion in &s;imilar ca&s;es, the following facts are extracted.&mdash; A child of Mr. Williams, at that time in Nantz, at about the age of 12 days was taken ill, and on the 13th to appearance died.&mdash;Mr. Wiilliams immediately de|termined to try an experiment on his child, and by gentle friction with &s;oft flannel near a fire, in about fifteen minutes re&s;tored it to life; though being very weak from a premature birth, it lived only 20 hours longer.&mdash;Mr. Williams him&s;elf at the age of nine years, fell into the mill-creek&mdash;it is uncertain how long he continued under water&mdash;he was at length di&s;|covered and taken up breathle&s;s; the body was placed between hot blankets and rubbed on every part with hot cloths, hot bricks were applied to the &s;oles of his feet, and all the other u&s;ual methods were employed, till every one except his mother was di&s;couraged, and de&s;i&s;ted from the u&s;e of means; &s;he alone, however, indefatigably per&s;evered, and was rewarded, though not until the end of four hours, with the exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure of re&s;toring him to life.</P>
<P>Doctor Franklin communicated to Mr. Williams the ca&s;e of a gentleman, who laboured under a di&s;ea&s;e which he him&s;elf &s;uppo&s;ed would prove mortal: When he approached the la&s;t agonies, his faithful &s;ervant was weeping by his &s;ide&mdash;he ordered the &s;ervant to watch him, and when he had breathed his la&s;t, to get naked into his bed, and as far as po&s;&s;ible encompa&s;s the body; then to breathe forcibly into his mouth, and continue this act till he &s;hould recover, or become cold.&mdash;He punctually obeyed; the gentleman recovered, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;tory many years after.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="021157_0016_0FB24CDA9FA8D008">Another well known in&s;tance is produced of a Phi|ladelphia gentleman in France, who about five years &s;ince was &s;uppo&s;ed to have died, and three days after|wards was about to be buried, when a Phy&s;ician pre|&s;ent happening to look into the coffin, was induced, from the appearance of the countenance, to delay the funeral; he immediately made u&s;e of the common methods; the gentleman revived, and is now alive and well in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e is extracted from a letter from Dr. Blodget, viz. That on the 4th or June 1757&punc; he was called to the &s;on of Mr. Nathaniel Gunn, jun. of Montague, who had been taken out of a Well, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead.

The Doctor opened a vein in the arm but could not obtain any blood; his next attempt to re&s;tore life was by friction, with warm flan|nels; by per&s;i&s;ting in this plan for about 15 minutes, the Boy began to grow warm, and motion was ob|&s;erved at the pit of the &s;tomach, and &s;oon after a &s;igh followed and a &s;poonful of water ran out of his mouth; his pul&s;e began to beat and re&s;piration took place, and in about an hour he was able to &s;it up in the bed.</P>
<P>Thus without any other means, excepting &s;ome trifling cordials, he was re&s;tored to life and health.</P>
<P>Mr. Gunn, upon being informed of the accident, went down the Well, perceiving the water perfectly &s;till, did not expect to find the Boy there; but plung|ing his arm into the water, which was near three feet deep, he found him laying at the bottom, and imme|diately carried him into the hou&s;e, &s;trip'd him, and laid him on the bed as the Doctor found him.</P>
<P>The Doctor ob&s;erves. that "though it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine how long the Boy was in a &s;tate of in|activity, breathle&s;s, and to appearance dead; yet if we allow fifteen minutes for the Boy to be under water,

(and I am of opinion it was much longer) and twenty five minutes for the me&s;&s;enger to come to me, to the di&s;tance of four miles; and twenty five minutes for me to go to Mr. Gunns, and fifteen minutes after I got there before life appeared in the Boy, we can ac|count for one hour and one quarter.</P>
<P>The following communication, with which we have been favored by Mr. James Sumner, farther proves the utility of per&s;everance in ca&s;es which at fir&s;t may appear entirely de&s;perate. A Lad of the name of Greene, had fallen into the mill-pond, in this town; he had been under water about 20 minutes, when he was found and brought on &s;hore apparently dead.&mdash;The body was agitated by rolling gently on a barrel, and a con&s;iderable quantity of water di&s;charged from the mouth thereby; after this he was conveyed to the hou&s;e of Mr. Sumner's father: Mr. Sumner immediately heated a blanket very hot and wrapp'd up in it the body of the lad, which he then placed before a pretty large fire, turning it &s;o as to expo&s;e every part to the fire; during this time the body was con&s;tantly rubb'd with fine &s;alt, but for the &s;pace of an hour and an half no &s;ign of life whatever appeared: After this Mr. Sumner &s;till per&s;evering, he thought he felt a &s;mall degree of fluttering motion in the belly; he &s;till con|tinued, applying his hands to various parts of the body, but would have been di&s;couraged from per&s;evering had he not heard that &s;uch attempts, though for a long time &s;eemingly fruitle&s;s, had finally, &s;ometimes, been crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; from this con&s;ideration the mea&s;ures were continued 'till at length a pul&s;ation was felt, fir&s;t in the temples, and &s;oon after in the wri&s;t; not long after this an effort was made to breathe, with a kind of &s;norting noi&s;e in drawing in the air; a num|ber of others &s;ucceeded, at fir&s;t more &s;lowly, but gra|dually in quicker &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, 'till he began to breathe free and ea&s;y; and nothing having been poured into the mouth, he at length appeared to be perfectly re|covered; when Mr. Sumner led him home in health to his parents.</P>

<HEAD>The following In&s;tances may &s;erve to convey &s;ome Idea of the Succe&s;s with which the In&s;titution has been attended.</HEAD>
<P>A Child of Mr. Samuel Da&s;hwood, jun. painter, in Bo&s;ton, of two years of age, in the month of October, 1787, fell into a Ci&s;tern of water, 7 feet deep, and was taken out by a gentleman of the neighbour|hood, and was apparently dead: Fortunately this gentleman was acquainted with the methods recom|mended by the HUMANE SOCIETY, and immediately began to put them into practice.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject was undre&s;&s;ed and wiped as dry as po&s;|&s;ible; hot blankets were wrapped round the body, and as one became cool, another was applied,&mdash;with the&s;e friction was u&s;ed to every part of the body; after a few minutes (between four and &s;even) they had the unexpected &s;atisfaction, to di&s;cover &s;igns of returning life,&mdash;the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of recovery, was a convul&s;ive motion of the che&s;t, attended with a forcible effort to di&s;tend the lungs: A Phy&s;ician arriving at this time, the pul&s;e was examined, and though perceptible, it was extremely languid and irregular:&mdash;Fumigation of tobacco, was vigorou&s;ly applied, and on the fir&s;t injec|tion into the bowels, it in&s;tantly produced a full in&s;pi|ration, &s;ucceeded by a loud and laborious roat&mdash;and an evident increa&s;e of the action of the heart;&mdash;On &s;u&s;|pending the u&s;e of this remedy, for a minute, the vigor of the pul&s;e was &s;en&s;ibly abated, and on returning to it again, the effects were as before, together with a &s;mall di&s;charge of indige&s;ted matter from the &s;tomach; in about 25 minutes from the child's being taken out of the water, the pul&s;e began to beat with &s;ome degree of regularity, and the breathing to be performed with le&s;s labour and interruption, though he was &s;till to appear|ance in con&s;iderable di&s;tre&s;s: At this period he was placed in a hot bed, with a per&s;on, who was directed to continue the friction; hot bricks were applied to the feet, and a warming-pan of coals directed to be repeat|edly moved over the bed cloaths. In three or four hours he appeared to be perfectly recovered, and is now a healthy and promi&s;ing child.</P>
