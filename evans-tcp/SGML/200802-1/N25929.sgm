<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>MADAM ROLAND, the wife of a man of &s;cience, was per&s;uaded, that the celebrity of a woman ought to be confined to the e&s;teem ari&s;ing from the prac|tice of the dome&s;tic virtues. On this account &s;he never would con&s;ent to publi&s;h writings, which might have procured her literary fame. It was even nece&s;|&s;ary to be intimately acquainted with her, to be able to form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of her native merit, her ac|quired talents, and her &s;trength of mind.</P>
<P>MADAM ROLAND, when the wife of a mini&s;ter, re|tained the &s;ame principles. She a&s;&s;i&s;ted her hu&s;band <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his political labours, as &s;he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him before in his &s;cientific pur&s;uits, without permitting her name to ap|pear. But her &s;ituation was changed. Her &s;ociety
<PB N="iv" REF="034483_0003_0FFDE82EE1F1C608">
before was confined to a few intimates, but now when &s;he was become the centre of a wider circle, the ad|miration of her friends, and the malevolence of her enemies, &s;oon combined to give her a celebrity which &s;he was &s;till far from &s;eeking.</P>
<P>IMPRISONED, calumninated on all &s;ides, and having no|thing but a &s;caffold before her eyes, Madam Roland was naturally induced to &s;eek the e&s;teem of po&s;terity as a con&s;olation for the inju&s;tice of her contemporaries, and to aim at future glory, as a &s;ort of compen&s;ation for an untimely death.</P>
<P>THEN, and not till then, &s;he appeared to &s;eparate her reputation from that of her hu&s;band: then, and not till then, &s;he took up her pen to make her&s;elf known individually, and to furni&s;h materials for hi&s;tory in her own name. It will be &s;een, however, that &s;he was not actuated &s;olely by the de&s;ire of vindicating her reputation, and acquiring fame: every page will &s;how, that &s;he was particularly anxious to repel the calumnious charges heaped upon her hu&s;band, and to revenge the memory of Roland, in ca&s;e he him&s;elf &s;hould not have it in his power to write or publi&s;h his la&s;t ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>THE public, already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour, will judge, from a peru&s;al of her writings, whether &s;he really merited the prai&s;e of her friends, and whether &s;he did not de&s;erve the hatred of the villains, who &s;ucceeded at la&s;t in bringing her to the block.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="034483_0004_0FFDE832E31E3FE8">MALEVOLENCE, a&s;&s;uming the ma&s;k of critici&s;m, will endeavour, no doubt, to depreciate this monument erected by a woman to the glory of her &s;ex; but the impartial reader will acknowledge her powers. I will only &s;ay, as an excu&s;e for &s;ome &s;uperfluous relations, and &s;ome negligences of compo&s;ition, that Madam Ro|land compo&s;ed the part entitled Hi&s;torical Memoirs (two thirds of which, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, are lo&s;t) in the &s;pace of one month, and all the re&s;t in two and twenty days, in the mid&s;t of &s;orrows and alarms of every kind; and that &s;carcely a pa&s;&s;age in the manu&s;cript is era&s;ed.</P>
<P>MANY per&s;ons, who&s;e characters Madam Roland has drawn, will have rea&s;on to complain; but it be|longs to po&s;terity alone to decide, whether &s;he has done them ju&s;tice. It was <HI>my</HI> duty to confine my|&s;elf &s;trictly to the office of an editor; and to make no alteration in the text, even when it was evident, that &s;he had been mi&s;taken. There is a pa&s;&s;age, for in|&s;tance, where &s;he &s;eems to throw reflections on citizen Dulaure, which I believe him far from de&s;erving, and which every true republican will be eager to reject. It may not be ami&s;s here to relate the cau&s;e of her error.</P>
<P>DULAURE, a patriotic journali&s;t, and a bold a&s;&s;ert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of truth, was a frequent vi&s;itor at Roland's, who&s;e prin|ciples were analogous to his own, and who&s;e conduct he deemed meritorious. But when Dulaure became a
<PB N="vi" REF="034483_0005_0FFDE8358E73FB50">
member of the convention, he thought it incumbent on him, as a matter of delicacy, to de&s;i&s;t from going to the hou&s;e of a mini&s;ter of who&s;e actions he was con|&s;tituted a judge. Madam Roland attributed this re&s;erve to a change of political opinions, and to the in&s;tigation of the Mountaineers: hence the ill-humour which &s;eems to have predominated, when &s;he wrote the article con|cerning him; but in which, notwith&s;tanding, &s;he does his character the ju&s;tice it de&s;erves. The courage with which citizen Dulaure printed all the complaints of Madam Roland after the 31&s;t of May; the honour|able pro&s;cription he has undergone; and his la&s;t pub|lication entitled, A Supplement to the Crimes of the late Committees of Government, render all farther ju&s;|tification unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I COULD have wi&s;hed to have given to the public the whole of the work at once; but the delays of the pre&s;s at the pre&s;ent moment, and the ob&s;ervations of &s;ome good citizens, have made me re&s;olve to pub|li&s;h one part at a time. There will be four, which will follow each other, as &s;peedily as circum&s;tances will permit. The &s;econd will contain &s;everal detached pieces, re&s;pecting the events of the revolution, with the papers that relate to her death, or that immediately preceded it. The third and fourth will contain her private life, written preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame intention, as the Confe&s;&s;ions of Rou&s;&s;eau: to which will be added &s;ome familiar letters, that I found among my papers. I much lament, that I have

not a more complete &s;eries of her corre&s;pondence to publi&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This corre&s;pondence, very active for &s;everal years, was frequent|ly diurnal during her abode at Amiens. Imperfect traces remain in my memory of &s;ome intere&s;ting letters which I cannot now find: po&s;&s;ibly they are with &s;everal others in the hands of Lanthenas, with whom that corre&s;pondence was frequently carried on in common. He then con&s;idered it, and with rea&s;on, as of great importance; but now!&mdash;</NOTE>: it is in the effu&s;ions of friend&s;hip, that the mind di&s;plays it&s;elf fully, and that our opinions, incli|nations, and acquirements, exhibit them&s;elves naked to the eye. On this account I con&s;ider her letters, though at fir&s;t view they appear to concern only our friend&s;hip, turn of mind, and our pur&s;uits as a nece&s;|&s;ary &s;upplement to her private memoirs. Her repub|lican ardour will appear from the very fir&s;t of them; and certainly, on the 28th of Augu&s;t, 1792, &s;he could not fore&s;ee, that France would become a republic; &s;till le&s;s that &s;he was de&s;tined to be a principal actor in that eventful &s;cene.</P>
<P>MADAM ROLAND was very fond of practi&s;ing epi&s;tolary writing. She turned her pen to every &s;ubject with incredible facility, and with uncommon elegance of &s;tile. As a letter-writer, &s;he was &s;uperior, in my opi|nion, to a Sevigne or a Maintenon: becau&s;e &s;he was far better informed than tho&s;e two celebrated women, and becau&s;e her corre&s;pondence con&s;i&s;ted of things, and not of words.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="034483_0007_0FFDE83AFB63A0E8">IT is my wi&s;h to collect &s;uch of her letters, as may have been pre&s;erved; and I here reque&s;t tho&s;e who have them in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to &s;end me the origi|nals, as free from expence as may be; as I purpo&s;e publi&s;hing them at the end of &s;everal literary produc|tions of madam Roland, which are known to me, and which I think worthy of &s;eeing the light.</P>
<P>ROLAND during his retreat had al&s;o compo&s;ed &s;ome hi&s;torical memoirs; but they were con&s;igned to the flames the moment the intrepid woman, who con|cealed him, was taken into cu&s;tody. At the conclu|&s;ion of his fir&s;t mini&s;try, he publi&s;hed a collection of pieces, calculated to make his conduct in office known to po&s;terity; it is my intention to continue it, by get|ting together &s;uch as relate to his &s;econd mini&s;try.</P>
<P>BUT that I may be enabled to accompli&s;h this ob|ject, as well as the preceding one, it is requi&s;ite, that the national convention, either by a general law, &s;oli|cited by all the friends of ju&s;tice, or by a particular decree, de&s;ired by every true friend of liberty, re&s;tore to Roland's daughter the property to which &s;he has a ju&s;t claim. I mu&s;t have liberty to &s;earch among the papers &s;till under &s;eal at Villefranche, and among tho&s;e taken from the hou&s;e at Paris, after the &s;ale of the furniture by the agents of the national domains. It is incumbent on all true republicans, victims of tyranny, and per&s;ecuted for their virtues or talents like Roland and his wife, to favour my wi&s;hes with their influence,
<PB N="ix" REF="034483_0008_0FFDE83DAAE9BF90">
and to promote my engaging ward's re&s;toration to her rights.</P>
<P>LET me be permitted to conclude with an ob&s;erva|tion, which perhaps is not unnece&s;&s;ary. This work is, at pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, the &s;ole fortune of Eudora, the beloved daughter, the only child of Roland. Woe to the villain who dares to pirate it! For certainly he would not be able to &s;ell a &s;ingle copy; and yet I &s;hould not fail to call down upon him all the ven|geance of the law.</P>

<Q>To day on a throne, to-morrow in a pri&s;on.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SUCH is the fate of virtue in revolutionary times. After the fir&s;t commotions of a nation, weary of the abu&s;es by which it has been aggrieved, have &s;ub&s;ided, enlightened men, who have pointed out its rights, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in regaining them, are called into places of authority: but they cannot long maintain them&s;elves there; for the ambitious, eager to take advantage of cir|cum&s;tances, &s;oon contrive to mi&s;lead the people by flat|tery, and &s;et them again&s;t their real defenders, that they them&s;elves may acquire con&s;equence and power. Such has been the progre&s;s of things, particularly &s;ince the tenth of Augu&s;t. On &s;ome future day, perhaps, I &s;hall recur to earlier times, to give an account of what my &s;ituation has enabled me to know: at pre&s;ent the &s;ole object I have in view is to commit the circum&s;tances of my arre&s;t to paper: it is the kind of amu&s;ement mo&s;t &s;uitable to the &s;olitary, to reflect on their per&s;onal con|cerns, and to expre&s;s what they feel.</P>
<P>The re&s;ignation of Roland appea&s;ed not his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. He had quitted the mini&s;try, in &s;pite of his re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to await there the laying of the &s;torm, and to brave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="12" REF="034483_0010_0FFDE842FB037BA0">
danger; becau&s;e the &s;tate of the council, when he became fully acquainted with it, and his want of influence, which kept continually increa&s;ing, and was particularly evi|dent about the middle of January, no longer left him any thing to look forward to but faults and follies, of which he mu&s;t participate the di&s;grace. He was not even al|lowed to enter his rea&s;ons or his opinions on the regi&s;ter of the proceedings, when they were contrary to the deter|mination of the majority.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equence was, that from the day of that pitiful decree re&s;pecting the comedy intituled <HI>l' Ami des Loix,</HI> which he would not &s;ign, becau&s;e the &s;econd article was at be&s;t ridiculous, he no longer affixed his &s;ignature to any deliberation of the council. That was the fifteenth of January. The pro&s;pect held out to him by the con|vention was by no means encouraging. His very name was there become the &s;ignal of di&s;cord and di&s;turbance; and could no longer be pronounced without producing an uproar. If a member ventured to an&s;wer the odious accu&s;ations gratuitou&s;ly preferred again&s;t the mini&s;ter, he was treated as an in&s;trument of faction, and reduced to &s;ilence. In the mean time Pache was accumulating in the war department all the faults which his weakne&s;s and implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the jacobins enabled the perfidy, imbecility, and imprudence of his agents to commit; and yet the convention could not obtain the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Pache; for the moment a &s;ingle &s;entence was uttered again&s;t him, the bloodhounds of the mountain &s;et up a howl again&s;t Roland. Thus the continuation of his cou|rageous &s;truggle in the mini&s;try could no longer prevent the faults of the council, while it became an additional motive of di&s;order in the convention. He deemed it
<PB N="13" REF="034483_0011_0FFDE845A51C07D0">
therefore prudent to give in his re&s;ignation. To prove that it was nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;uffices to remark, that the &s;ound part of the legi&s;lative body, convinced as it was of the virtues and talents of the calumniated mini&s;ter, dur&s;t not make a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation on the &s;ubject. This was unque&s;tionably weakne&s;s; for it &s;tood in need of a firm and hone&s;t man in the home department, who would have been its mo&s;t powerful &s;upport; and lo&s;ing this it could not do otherwi&s;e than &s;ubmit to the yoke of the violent patriots, who were endeavouring to &s;et up and maintain an authority capable of rivalling the na|tional repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>ROLAND kept a u&s;urping commune in awe. Roland gave to all the admini&s;trative bodies a regular, uniform, and harmonious motion: he watched over the &s;upply of provi&s;ions of the great national family: he found means to re-e&s;tabli&s;h peace in all the departments; he diffu&s;ed throughout them that order which proceeds from ju&s;tice, and that confidence which is kept alive by a vigilant ad|mini&s;tration; and he &s;et on foot between them a friendly corre&s;pondence, and a ready communication of knowledge Roland ought therefore to have been &s;upported: but &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> weakne&s;s denied the means, he, to whom that weakne&s;s was well known, could not choo&s;e but retire.</P>
<P>THE timid Garat, an agreeable companion, a man of letters, of moderate merit, and a dete&s;table mini&s;ter; Garat, who&s;e appointment to the judicial department proved the want of able men, a want which is incon|ceivable, and which none can tell but they who, occu|pying places of importance, have coadjutors to &s;eek; Garat had not even &s;en&s;e enough to remain in that of|fice, where there is lea&s;t to be done, and where his bad
<PB N="14" REF="034483_0012_0FFDE84851475700">
health, his natural indolence, and his incapacity for bu|&s;ine&s;s, would have been lea&s;t con&s;picuous; but removed to the home department, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of the requi&s;ite knowledge, not only where politics are the que&s;tion, but in regard to commerce, the arts, and a multitude of admini&s;trative operations, that come within its cognizance. With all that ignorance, and with all his inactivity, he ventured to take the place of the mo&s;t active man in the republic, and the be&s;t informed in all the above particulars. The relaxation of the machine &s;oon occa&s;ioned the di&s;location of its parts, and proved the weakne&s;s of the regulator: the departments were thrown into commotion, &s;carcity began to be felt, the flames of civil war were lighted up in la Vend&eacute;e; the authorities of Paris exceeded their powers; the jacobins a&s;&s;umed the reins of government; and the puppet Pache, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the department, which he had thrown into confu&s;ion, was rai&s;ed by a cabal to the mayoralty, where his &s;upplene&s;s was wanted, while his place at the council-board was filled by the idiot Bouchotte, as &s;up|ple as he, and even &s;urpa&s;&s;ing him in &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>ROLAND gave a terrible blow to his adver&s;aries, by publi&s;hing, on his retirement, &s;uch accounts, as no mini&s;ter before him had furni&s;hed. To have them ex|amined and &s;anctioned by a report, was a piece of ju&s;|tice, which he was doomed to &s;olicit in vain; for that would have been acknowledging the fal&s;ehood of the ob|loquy thrown on him, the infamy of his detractors, and the weakne&s;s of the convention, which had not dared to undertake his defence.</P>
<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;evere in &s;landering him, without coming to the proof; in order to perplex
<PB N="15" REF="034483_0013_0FFDE84AF748E888">
and mi&s;lead the public opinion, &s;o as to be able to ruin him with impunity; and thus to get rid of a trouble&s;ome witne&s;s of &s;o many atrocities, which mu&s;t either be concealed, or ju&s;tified, to pre&s;erve to the perpetrators the wealth and authority they helped them to acquire. In vain did Roland entreat, publi&s;h, and write &s;even times in four months to the convention, to demand an examination and a report on his conduct in the mini&s;try. The jacobins continued to employ their &s;atellites, to proclaim him a traitor: Marat proved to <HI>his people</HI> that the ex-mini&s;ter's head was nece&s;&s;ary to the tranquillity of the republic: con&s;piracies fru&s;trated, &s;et on foot anew, baffled again, and yet con&s;tanly carried on, ended at length in the in&s;urrection of the 31&s;t of May, when the good people of Paris, with a fixed determination to ma&s;&s;acre no one, did every thing be&s;ides that their audacious directors, their in&s;olent commune, and the revolutionary committee of me&s;&s;ieurs the Jacobins, grown mad or furious, or el&s;e become the hirelings of the enemy, were plea&s;ed to require. Roland had writ|ten the eighth time to the convention, which had not even deigned to read his letter; and I was preparing to get the municipality to &s;ign pa&s;&s;ports, by means of which I might go with my daughter into the country, whither I was called by dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s, by the &s;tate of my health, and by many good rea&s;ons be&s;ide. Among other things I con&s;idered, how much more ea&s;y it would be for Roland to e&s;cape alone from the pur&s;uit of his enemies, &s;hould they proceed to the la&s;t extremities, than for the whole of his little family together: prudence pointed out the propriety of dimini&s;hing the number of
<PB N="16" REF="034483_0014_0FFDE84DA05217F8">
points in which he was attackable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That was not my &s;tronge&s;t inducement: for, tired of the cour&s;e of affairs, I feared nothing for my&s;elf; innocent and courageous, in|ju&s;tice might reach, but could not degrade me; and to &s;uffer it, was a trial, in the thought of braving which I felt plea&s;ure; but another rea&s;on, altogether per&s;onal, and which &s;ome day perhaps my pen will di&s;clo&s;e, determined me to depart.</NOTE>. My pa&s;&s;ports had been delayed at the &s;ection, through the chicanery of &s;ome zealous marati&s;ts, in who&s;e eyes I was an object of &s;u&s;picion; and they were but ju&s;t delivered to me, when a fit of the nervous colic, attended with violent convul&s;ions, the only indi&s;po&s;ition to which I am &s;ubject, and to which the vehement affections of a &s;trong mind ruling a robu&s;t body expo&s;e me, obliged me to keep my bed. I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ix days in this &s;tate, and purpo&s;ed going out on Friday, to &s;hew my&s;elf at the municipality; but the &s;ound of the alarm-bell informed me, that it was not a proper time. Every thing had long foretold an approaching cri&s;is. It is true that the a&s;cendancy of the jacobins made it very unlikely that its i&s;&s;ue &s;hould be favourable to the real friends of liberty: but energetic minds dete&s;t &s;u&s;pen&s;e; and the deba&s;ement of the con|vention, with its daily acts of weakne&s;s and &s;lavery, appeared to me &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, that I hardly con&s;idered the wor&s;t exce&s;&s;es as more lamentable, becau&s;e they would nece&s;&s;arily contribute to open the eyes, and de|termine the conduct of the departments. The alarm gun, and the commotions of the day, awakened in me that intere&s;t, which great events in&s;pire, without pro|ducing any painful emotion. Two or three per&s;ons came to confer with us; and one, in particular, pre&s;&s;ed Roland to make his appearance at his &s;ection, by which
<PB N="17" REF="034483_0015_0FFDE850506520D8">
he was e&s;teemed, and of which the good di&s;po&s;ition was the be&s;t warrant of his &s;afety. It was agreed, however, that he &s;hould not &s;leep at home the following night: though, by the way, nothing was talked of but the good intentions of the citizens, who drew up under arms, in order to oppo&s;e every act of violence.

<P>THE blood boils in my veins when I hear prai&s;es be|&s;towed on the good-nature of the Pari&s;ians, who are de|termined not to have another day like the 2d of Sep|tember. Why, good heavens! nobody wants you to exe|cute another; you need only &s;uffer it as you did before: but you are nece&s;&s;ary to collect the victims, and you kindly lend your aid to apprehend them; you are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give the appearance of a legitimate in&s;urrection to the violence of the galleries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the convention, which at this period were filled with ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the jacobin club. <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE> by whom you are governed, and you approve their undertakings: you obey their orders, you &s;wear fealty to the mon&s;trous authorities they create; you &s;urround the legi&s;lative body with your b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yonets, and you permit rebels to dictate to the national repre&s;en|tation the decrees they wi&s;h to pa&s;s. Boa&s;t then no more of being its defenders; it is you who bind it in chains; you who deliver into the hands of oppre&s;&s;ion the members, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their virtues and their talents; you who with equal cowardice would &s;ee them brought to the block, by proceedings &s;imilar to tho&s;e that de&s;troyed Sidney; and you it is who will have to an&s;wer to indignant France for &s;o many crimes; who

&s;erve the cau&s;e of her enemies, and who prepare the way for federali&s;m. Think you, that the high-&s;pirited Mar&s;eilles, and the enlightened department of la Gironde, will pa&s;s over the outrages committed on their repre&s;entatives, or fraterni&s;e with a city polluted by &s;uch crimes? You are the de&s;troyers of your country, and &s;oon will you lament, in vain, your infamous pu&s;illanimity in the mid&s;t of its ruins.</P>
<P>IT was half after five in the evening, when &s;ix armed men came to our hou&s;e. One of them read to Roland an order of the <HI>revolutionary committee,</HI> by virtue of which they were come to apprehend him. 'I know no law,' &s;aid Roland, 'which con&s;titutes the authority you men|tion; nor &s;hall I obey the orders which it i&s;&s;ues. If you employ violence, I can only oppo&s;e to you &s;uch re&s;i&s;t|ance as a man of my years is capable of; but I &s;hall pro|te&s;t again&s;t it to the la&s;t moment of my life.'&mdash;'I have no order to employ violence,' replied the &s;poke&s;man, 'I &s;hall therefore go and communicate your an&s;wer to the council-general of the commune: in the mean time I will leave my colleagues here.'</P>
<P>IT occurred to me immediately, that it would not be ami&s;s to denounce the&s;e proceedings to the convention, in the mo&s;t public manner, in order to prevent the arre&s;t of Roland, or to obtain his prompt relea&s;e, if it &s;hould have taken place. To communicate this idea to my hu&s;band, write a letter to the pre&s;ident, and &s;et out, was the bu&s;ine&s;s of a few minutes. My &s;ervant being ab|&s;ent, I left a friend, who was in the hou&s;e, to keep Ro|land company; and &s;tepped alone into a hackney coach, which I ordered to proceed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to the Ca|rouzel. The court-yard of the Tuileries was filled
<PB N="19" REF="034483_0017_0FFDE855ABF1B1E0">
with armed men. I cro&s;&s;ed it, and flew through the mid&s;t of them like a bird. I was dre&s;&s;ed in a morning gown, and had put on a black &s;haul, and a veil. On my arrival at the doors of the outer halls, which were all &s;hut, I found &s;entinels, who allowed no one to enter, or &s;ent me by turns from door to door. In vain did I in&s;i&s;t on admi&s;&s;ion; till at length it came into my mind to employ &s;uch language as a bigotted Robe&s;perian would have held. 'Why, citizens,' &s;aid I, 'in this day of &s;alvation for our country, and in the mid&s;t of the traitors, from whom we have &s;o much to fear, you do not know then of what importance &s;ome notes may be which I wi&s;h to tran&s;mit to the pre&s;ident. Send at lea&s;t for an u&s;her, that I may entru&s;t them to his care.'</P>
<P>THE doors in&s;tantly flew open, and I walked into the petitioner's hall. I then enquired for one of the u&s;hers, and was de&s;ired by a &s;entry, planted within the hall, to wait till one came out. A quarter of an hour had al|ready pa&s;&s;ed, when I perceived Ro&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Scotchman, who was u&s;her to the convention, as well as to each of the preceding a&s;&s;emblies. <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, the very man who had brought me the decree of the convention, re|que&s;ting me to repair to the bar, on account of the ri|diculous accu&s;ation of Viard, whom I overwhelmed with confu&s;ion: I now &s;olicited permi&s;&s;ion to appear there, and repre&s;ented Roland's danger, as connected with the pub|lic weal.

<P>ROSE went in que&s;t of him; at the end of a very con|&s;iderable time he came; and we talked together for &s;even or eight minutes. He then returned to the hall, came back, and &s;aid: 'In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the a&s;&s;embly, I dare not flatter you: you have no great room for hope.

Inform your worthy colleagues: a courageous &s;ally may have a great effect, or at lea&s;t will &s;erve to &s;et a great example.'&mdash;I was indeed, in that temper of mind, which imparts eloquence: warm with indignation, and &s;uperior to all fear, my bo&s;om glowing for my country, the ruin of which I fore&s;aw, every thing dear to me in the world at &s;take, feeling &s;trong|ly, expre&s;&s;ing my &s;entiments with fluency, and too proud not to utter them with dignity, I had the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts to di&s;cu&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome means of defending them, and was in a &s;ingular &s;ituation for doing it with advantage.&mdash;'But, at any rate,' &s;aid Verg|niaux, 'your letter cannot be read this hour or two; a motion of &s;ix articles is going to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: and pe|titioners, deputed by the &s;ections, are waiting at the bar; only think what a tedious time you will have to &s;tay!'&mdash; 'I will go home, then, to know what has been pa&s;&s;ing there, and will immediately return; you may tell our friends &s;o.' &mdash;'Mo&s;t of them are ab&s;ent: they behave courageou&s;ly, when they are here; but they are deficient in affiduity.' &mdash;'That, alas! is but too true.'</P>
<P>I quitted Vergniaux, flew to Louvet's, wrote a note to inform him of what was going on, and what I fore&s;aw would follow; threw my&s;elf into a hackney-coach, and ordered it to drive home. The wretched hor&s;es did not get on to my mind; and we were &s;oon met by battalions of national guards, who&s;e march &s;topped the way. I jumped out of the coach, paid the coachman, ru&s;hed through the ranks, and made off. This was near the Louvre, from whence I ran to our hou&s;e, which was
<PB N="22" REF="034483_0020_0FFDE85DDA7C5988">
in the <HI>Rue de la Harpe,</HI> oppo&s;ite the &s;chool of &s;urgery. The porter whi&s;pered me, that Roland was gone to the landlord's at the bottom of the court; and thither I repaired, per&s;piring at every pore. A gla&s;s of wine was brought me, and I was told, that the bearer of the war|rant having returned, without being able to procure a hearing at the council, Roland had per&s;i&s;ted in prote&s;t|ing again&s;t his orders; and that the&s;e good people, after demanding his prote&s;t in writing, had withdrawn; in con|&s;equence of which Roland had come to beg a pa&s;&s;age through their apartments, and had got out of the hou&s;e by the back door. I did the &s;ame in order to find him, to inform him of the attempt I had made, and of the &s;teps I meant to pur&s;ue. At the fir&s;t hou&s;e to which I repaired, I found him not: in the &s;econd I did. From the &s;olitude of the &s;treets, which, by the way, were illu|minated, I pre&s;umed that it was late: I prepared never|thele&s;s to return to the convention, where I &s;hould have taken care to be ignorant of Roland's e&s;cape, and &s;hould have &s;poken as I had before intended. I was going to &s;et out on foot, without recollecting, that it was pa&s;t ten o'clock, and that I was out that day for the fir&s;t time &s;ince my illne&s;s, which demanded re&s;t and the bath. A hackney-coach was brought me. On ap|proaching the Carouzel, I &s;aw nothing more of the armed force, except two pieces of cannon, and a few men, who were &s;till at the gate of the national palace; I went up to it, and found that the &s;itting was at an end.</P>

<P>I had cro&s;&s;ed the court, and was returning to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ney-coach, while concluding this dialogue with an old fans-culotte, who was well paid no doubt for tutoring the dupes.

There I meaned to call on a friend, with whom I intended to concert the means of conveying Ro|land out of Paris. We had not gone a dozen yards be|fore the coach &s;topped. 'What is the matter?' &s;aid I to the coachman.&mdash;'Ah, he has left me; like a fool; for I wanted to keep him for my little boy. They would have been rare company for one another. Here! Here! my little fellow.'&mdash;I recollected the dog, and was highly plea&s;ed at having for my coachman, at &s;uch an hour, a good-natured man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a feeling heart, and a father. 'Endeavour to catch him:' &s;aid I: 'you &s;hall put him into the coach, and I will take care of him. &mdash;The hone&s;t fellow, quite delighted, caught the dog, opened the door, and gave him to me for a com|panion. The poor animal appeared &s;en&s;ible, that he had found protection and an a&s;ylum, and care&s;&s;ed me with great affection. I recollected the tale of Sandi, in which he de&s;cribes an old man, who being weary of his fellow-creatures, and di&s;gu&s;ted with their pa&s;&s;ions, retired to a wood; and there con&s;tructed him&s;elf a dwelling, of which he enlivened the &s;olitude by the &s;ociety of &s;everal animals, who repaid his cares with te&s;timonies of affection, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;pecies of gratitude, with which he contented him|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for want of meeting with its like among mankind.</P>

<P>I MAY be a&s;ked, why, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, I re|turned to the hou&s;e? nor is the que&s;tion irrelevant; for &s;lander had attacked me too, and malevolence might direct its &s;hafts again&s;t my bo&s;om; but to give a proper an&s;wer to it, the &s;tate of my mind ought to be com|pletely developed; and that would require details, which I re&s;erve for a future period: their re&s;ults will be all I &s;hall notice at pre&s;ent. I have naturally an aver&s;ion to every thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the grand, bold, and ingenu|ous proceedings of innocence: an effort to e&s;cape from the hand of inju&s;tice would be to me more painful, than any thing it can inflict. In the la&s;t two months of Roland's admini&s;tration, our friends often urged us to quit the hotel, and three &s;everal times they found means to make us &s;leep from home; but it was always contrary to my inclina|tion. It was an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination that was then apprehended; but I was of opinion, that no one would readily under|take to violate the a&s;ylum of a man inve&s;ted with a public office; and if there were villains bold enough to attempt &s;uch a crime, it appeared to me, that its perpetration would not be altogether u&s;ele&s;s. At all events, it was incumbent on the mini&s;ter to be at his po&s;t, for there his death would cry aloud for vengeance, and be a le&s;&s;on to the republic; while it was po&s;&s;ible to reach his life when abroad, with equal advantage to the devi&s;ers of the deed, but with le&s;s benefit to the public weal, and le&s;s glory to
<PB N="27" REF="034483_0025_0FFDE86A338D3460">
the victim. Such rea&s;oning, I am well aware, will be deemed ab&s;urd by tho&s;e who prefer life to all things: but he, who &s;ets any value on his exi&s;tence in a period of revolution, will &s;et none on virtue, on honour, or on his country. Accordingly I refu&s;ed to leave the hotel in the month of January; Roland's bed was in my chamber, that we might both undergo the &s;ame fate: and under my pillow I kept a pi&s;tol, not to kill tho&s;e who might come to murder us, but to &s;ecure my&s;elf from their out|rages, if they offered to lay hands upon my per&s;on.</P>
<P>WHEN out of office the obligation was no longer the &s;ame, and I thought it right in Roland to &s;hun the fury of the populace, and the clutches of his enemies. As to me, they had not an equal intere&s;t in doing me a mi&s;chief: killing me would be incurring an odium they did not de&s;ire; and my commitment to pri&s;on would be of little &s;ervice to them, and to me no great misfortune. If they &s;hould feel any &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, wi&s;h to proceed accord|ing to form, and begin the bu&s;ine&s;s by making me un|dergo an examination, I &s;hould find no difficulty in con|founding them; and my an&s;wers might even &s;erve to di&s;pel more rapidly the delu&s;ion of tho&s;e who were only mi&s;led in regard to Roland. If they &s;hould dare to go the length of another &s;econd of September, it could only be becau&s;e all the hone&s;t members of the convention would be al&s;o in their power, and becau&s;e all would be lo&s;t at Paris. In that ca&s;e I &s;hould prefer death, to living a witne&s;s of my country's ruin; and glory in being comprehended among the glorious victims &s;acrificed to guilty fury. That fury, glutted by my de&s;truction, would be le&s;s violent again&s;t, Roland, who, if once &s;aved from this cri&s;is, might &s;till tender great &s;ervices to the public in other parts of
<PB N="28" REF="034483_0026_0FFDE86E037953F8">
France. Thus, of two things one was &s;ure to happen: either I might only ri&s;que impri&s;onment and a trial, which would redound to my hu&s;band's and my country's good; or el&s;e, if I were doomed to peri&s;h, it would be under cir|cum&s;tances in which life it&s;elf would be a burthen.</P>

I have brought her up with the enthu&s;ia&s;tic anxiety of maternal love.

Since Roland's re&s;ignation, I had lived &s;o &s;ecluded from the world, that I had &s;carcely the &s;malle&s;t in|tercour&s;e with any human creature: the family at one hou&s;e, in which I might have concealed my&s;elf, was gone into the country; in another there was a &s;ick per&s;on, which rendered the admi&s;&s;ion of a new gue&s;t difficult; and that in which Roland lay hidden, could not accommo|date me without the greate&s;t inconvenience; it would be|&s;ides have been &s;u&s;picious, if not impolitic, for me to have been in the &s;ame place with him; and, in the la&s;t place, I &s;hould even have been &s;orry to abandon my &s;er|vants.

<P>The whole troop withdrew much di&s;&s;atisfied; but I perceived that a &s;entry was left at my door, and a guard at that of the hou&s;e. I therefore inferred, that I had nothing to do but to &s;ummon &s;trength to &s;upport the wor&s;t that might happen. Being overcome with fa|tigue, I ordered &s;upper, fini&s;hed my letter, entru&s;ted it to my faithful maid, and retired to bed. I &s;lept &s;oundly for about an hour, when a &s;ervant came into my chamber, to inform me, that &s;ome gentlemen of the &s;ection re|que&s;ted me to &s;tep into the adjoining apartment. 'I un|der&s;tand what it means,' replied I: 'go, child; I will not make them wait.' I &s;prung out of bed, and was dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf when my maid came in, and expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e at my being at the pains to put on any thing more than my bed-gown,&mdash;'When people are going abroad,' &s;aid I, 'they &s;hould at lea&s;t be decent.'&mdash;The poor woman looked in my face, and the tears gu&s;hed from her eyes. I went into the next room.</P>

In the mean time I deliberated, whether I &s;hould carry my re&s;i&s;tance to the utmo&s;t, or quietly re&s;ign my&s;elf into their hands.

have &s;ent for a ju&s;tice of peace of the &s;ection, and you &s;ee here a detachment of his armed force.'&mdash;The ju&s;tice of peace came, went into the parlour, and &s;ealed up every thing, even to the windows and the drawers containing linen. One &s;trange fellow would have had the <HI>forte piano</HI> &s;ealed up too, but he was told it was a mu&s;ical in|&s;trument; he then drew out a foot rule, and took its dimen&s;ions, as if he intended it for &s;ome particular place. I a&s;ked leave to take out my daughter's clothes, and made up a &s;mall packet of night-clothes for my&s;elf. In the mean time fifty or a hundred per&s;ons were pa&s;&s;ing backwards and forwards continually, completely filled two rooms, crowded every place, and might ea&s;ily have concealed malevolent per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed either to depo&s;it or to carry any thing away. The atmo&s;phere became in|fected with noi&s;ome exhalations, and I was obliged to retire to the window of the anti-chamber for a little fre&s;h air. The officer not daring to lay his commands upon this crowd, reque&s;ted them now and then in gentle terms to withdraw, which only &s;erved to produce the exchange of one &s;et of per&s;ons for another. Sitting down at my bureau, I wrote to a friend concerning my &s;ituation, and to recommend my daughter to his care. I was folding up the letter, when Mr. Nicaud, the bearer of the order from the commune, told me it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould read what I had written to them, and let them know to whom it was ad|dre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;'I have no objection to read it, if that will &s;atisfy you.'&mdash;'No, it would be better to let us know to whom you are writing.&mdash;'I &s;hall do no &s;uch thing: the title of my friend is not of a nature, at pre&s;ent, to induce me, to name the per&s;on on whom I be&s;tow it:' and on my &s;aying this I tore the letter to pieces. While I turned my&s;elf
<PB N="32" REF="034483_0030_0FFDE878C502C6A0">
from them, they gathered up the fragments, in order to &s;eal them up: a &s;tupid precaution, which tempted me to laugh; for the letter was without an addre&s;s.</P>
<P>AT length, at &s;even in the morning, I left my daughter and my &s;ervants, after having exhorted them to be pa|tient and calm, and feeling my&s;elf more honoured by their tears, than dejected by the oppre&s;&s;ion of which I was the victim.&mdash;'You have people there, who love you:' &s;aid one of the commi&s;&s;ioners.&mdash;'I never had any about me who did not:' replied I, while walking down &s;tairs. From the bottom of the &s;tair-ca&s;e to the coach, which was drawn up on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet, I found two ranks of armed citizens; and proceeded gravely with mea&s;ured &s;teps, and with my eyes fixed upon the&s;e pu&s;illanimous or deluded men. The armed force fol|lowed the coach in two files; while the wretched po|pulace, deceived, and ma&s;&s;acred in the per&s;ons of its true friends, &s;topped as I pa&s;&s;ed by, attracted by the &s;ight, and &s;everal of the women exclaimed, '<HI>Away with her to the guillotine.</HI>'&mdash;'Shall we draw up the blinds?' &s;aid one of the commi&s;&s;ioners very civilly.&mdash;'No, gentlemen, innocence, however oppre&s;&s;ed, never puts on the gui&s;e of criminality: I fear not the eye of any one, nor will I conceal my&s;elf from any per&s;on's view.'&mdash;'You have more &s;trength of mind than many men: you wait pa|tiently for ju&s;tice.'&mdash;'Ju&s;tice!

feared aught but guilt; and inju&s;tice and death I de&s;pi&s;e.'&mdash; The poor commi&s;&s;ioners under&s;tood but little of this lan|guage, and probably thought it very ari&s;tocratic.</P>
<P>WE arrived at the Abbey, the theatre of tho&s;e bloody &s;cenes, the revival of which the jacobins have for &s;ome time preached up with &s;o much fervour. Five or &s;ix field-beds, with as many men &s;tretched on them, in a dark and dreary room, were the fir&s;t objects that &s;truck my &s;ight. After pa&s;&s;ing the wicket, every thing &s;eemed in motion; and my guides made me a&s;cend a dirty and narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e. At length we came to the keeper's apartment, and found him in a kind of little parlour, kept tolerably clean, where he offered me a &s;eat. 'Where is my room?' &s;aid I to his wife, a corpulent woman, of an agreeable countenance.&mdash;'Madam, I did not expect you; I have no room as yet: but in the mean time you will remain here.'&mdash;The commi&s;&s;ioners went into the adjoining room, directed an entry of their warrant to be made, and gave their verbal orders. The&s;e, I after|wards learnt, were very &s;evere, and often renewed after|wards, but they dur&s;t not give them in writing; and the keeper knew his trade too well literally to ob&s;erve what he was under no obligation to perform. He is an active, obliging, and civil man: and in fulfilling his official duties does every thing that humanity or ju&s;tice can demand.' &mdash;'What would you choo&s;e for breakfa&s;t?'&mdash;'A little capillaire and water.'</P>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ioners withdrew, ob&s;erving to me, that if Roland were not guilty, there could have been no oc|ca&s;ion for him to ab&s;cond.&mdash;'It is &s;o &s;trange to &s;u&s;pect a man, who has rendered &s;uch important &s;ervices to the

cau&s;e of liberty; there is &s;omething &s;o abominable in ca|lumniating, and per&s;ecuting with &s;uch bitter rage, a mini|&s;ter who&s;e conduct is &s;o open, and who&s;e accounts are &s;o clear, that he is fully ju&s;tified in avoiding the la&s;t outrages of envy. Ju&s;t as Ari&s;tides, and &s;evere as Cato, it is to his virtues he is indebted for his enemies. Their fury knows no bounds: but let them &s;atiate it on me: I defy its power, and devote my&s;elf to death. It is incumbent on him to &s;ave him&s;elf for the &s;ake of his country, to which he may yet be capable of rendering important &s;ervices.' An awkward bow, in which their confu&s;ion was evident, was the only an&s;wer the gentlemen thought fit to make me.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, I &s;at down to breakfa&s;t, and in the mean time a bed-chamber was ha&s;tily put in order, into which I was introduced.&mdash;'You may remain here, madam, the whole day; and if I cannot get an apartment ready for you this evening, as we are rather crowded, a bed &s;hall be made up in the parlour.'&mdash;After &s;aying this, the keeper's wife made &s;ome civil ob&s;ervations on the re|gret &s;he felt whenever a per&s;on of her own &s;ex arrived, 'for,' added &s;he, 'they have not all your &s;erene counte|nance, madam.'&mdash;I thanked her with a &s;mile; and &s;he locked me in.</P>
<P>WILL, then, I am in pri&s;on, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, &s;itting down and falling into the deepe&s;t reverie. The mo|ments that followed, I would not exchange for tho&s;e which others may e&s;teem the happie&s;t of my life, nor will they ever be era&s;ed from my memory. In a critical &s;ituation, and with a &s;tormy and precarious period in view, they made me &s;en&s;ible of the value of hone&s;ty and fortitude, in union with a good con&s;ci|ence,
<PB N="35" REF="034483_0033_0FFDE88216AEDE98">
and firm temper of mind. Hitherto impelled by circum&s;tances, my actions, in this cri&s;is, had been the re&s;ult of &s;trong feelings, hurrying me away. How grate|ful to find their effects ju&s;tified by the &s;ober operation of rea&s;on! I recalled the pa&s;t to my mind: I calculated future events: and if while li&s;tening to a tender heart, I &s;ometimes felt too powerful an affection, I did not di&s;|cover one that could &s;uffu&s;e my cheek with a blu&s;h; not one, but what &s;erved to keep alive my courage, nor one that my rea&s;on was not able to &s;ubdue. I de|voted my&s;elf, if I may &s;o &s;ay, voluntarily to my de&s;tiny, whatever it might be: I defied its rigour, and fixed my|&s;elf firmly in that &s;tate of mind, in which we only &s;eek employment for the pre&s;ent, without giving our&s;elves any concern about the future. But this tranquillity with regard to what concerned me alone, I did not even en|deavour to extend to the fate of my country, and of my friends: I waited for the evening paper, and li&s;tened to the noi&s;e in the &s;treet with inexpre&s;&s;ible a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xiety. I did not however neglect to make enquiry concerning my new &s;ituation, and what portion of liberty was left me.&mdash; 'May I write? May I &s;ee any body? What will be my ex|pences here? were my fir&s;t que&s;tions. Lavacquerie, the keeper, acquainted me with the directions given him, and the liberty he could venture to take with orders of that kind. I wrote to my faithful maid, to come and &s;ee me; but it was agreed that &s;he &s;hould keep this indulgence a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t vi&s;it I received at the Abbey was from Grand|pr&eacute; on the day of my arrival.&mdash;'You &s;hould write to the a&s;&s;embly,' &s;aid he; 'have you not yet been think|ing of it?'&mdash;'No: and now you put me in mind,

<P>"LEGISLATORS! I have ju&s;t been torn from my home, from the arms of my daughter, a girl of twelve years of age, and am detained in the Abbey, by virtue of orders which a&s;&s;ign no cau&s;e for my con|finement. Tho&s;e orders were i&s;&s;ued by a revolutionary committee; and commi&s;&s;ioners of the commune, who accompanied tho&s;e of the committee, &s;hewed me others from the council-general, which were equally defective.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words between double commas had been changed.</NOTE>" Thus am I placed in the light of a culprit before the eyes of the public. I was dragged to pri&s;on with great parade, in the mid&s;t of an o&s;tentatious guard, and of a mi&s;led populace, &s;ome of whom were for &s;ending me to the &s;caffold; without my conductors being able to a&s;|&s;ign to me or to any other per&s;on the rea&s;on why I was pre&s;umed a criminal, and treated accordingly. This is not all. The bearer of the orders of the commune made no u&s;e of them except in regard to my&s;elf, and to make me &s;ign minutes of what pa&s;&s;ed: as &s;oon as I quitted my apartment, I was delivered over to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the revolutionary committee, who conducted me to the Abbey; and on their warrant alone I was con&s;tituted a pri&s;oner. An atte&s;ted copy of that warrant, &s;igned by

a &s;ingle individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no office, is here &s;ub|joined. Every thing in my hou&s;e has been &s;ealed up&punc; and while that was doing, which was from three o'clock in the morning till &s;even, a crowd of citizens filled my apartment. If, among the number, there were any ma|licious per&s;on, capable of privately &s;lipping fal&s;e evi|dence into a library open in every part, he could not want an opportunity.</P>
<P>'As early as ye&s;terday, the &s;ame committee &s;ought to put the late mini&s;ter under arre&s;t, though the laws ren|der him accountable to you alone for the acts of his admini&s;tration, and though he has been ince&s;&s;antly &s;o|liciting an enquiry.</P>
<P>'ROLAND had prote&s;ted again&s;t the order, and the bearers of it had withdrawn.

<P>THE agitation, in which I had pa&s;&s;ed the preceding night, made me feel extreme fatigue. I de&s;ired to have a chamber that very evening; and obtained one, of which I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at ten o'clock. When I en|tered it, and found my&s;elf &s;urrounded by four dirty walls, in the mid&s;t of which was a bed without curtains; when I perceived a double-grated window; and when I was a&s;|&s;ailed by that &s;mell, which a per&s;on accu&s;tomed to an apartment extremely clean, always finds in tho&s;e that are not &s;o, I was &s;en&s;ible that I was indeed an inhabitant of a pri&s;on, and that I had no plea&s;ure to expect from &s;uch a &s;ituation. My room, however, was &s;ufficiently &s;pacious; there was a fire-place; the bed cloths were tolerable; a pillow was given me; and e&s;timating things, in them&s;elves, without entering into compari&s;ons, I deem|ed my&s;elf not altogether badly accommodated. I went to bed fully re&s;olved to remain in it as long as I &s;hould find my&s;elf comfortable there; and was not up at ten in the morning, when Grandpr&eacute; arrived. He did not appear le&s;s affected, but more unea&s;y, than the pre|ceding evening; and ca&s;t a mournful look around the

<P>'How did you pa&s;s the night?' &s;aid he with tears &s;tanding in his eyes.&mdash;'I was repeatedly waked by the noi&s;e; but fell a&s;leep again as &s;oon as it was over, in &s;pite even of the alarm-bell, which I thought I heard this morning.&mdash;Ha!&mdash;is it not &s;ounding &s;till?'&mdash;'Why I thought &s;o:&mdash;but it is nothing.'&mdash;'Be it as it plea&s;es heaven: if they kill me, it &s;hall be in this bed; for I am &s;o weary, that here I will expect my fate.

Here is what we propo&s;e to &s;ub&s;titute; and then you &s;hould write a line or two to the mini&s;ter of the home department, that he may tran&s;mit your letter officially, which would enable me the better to &s;olicit its being read.'&mdash;I took the paper; looked at it; and &s;aid to him, 'if I thought my letter would be read as it now &s;tands, &s;o it &s;hould remain, even were I &s;ure of its be|ing attended with no advantage to my&s;elf; for it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to hope for ju&s;tice from the convention.

<P>RISING about noon, I con&s;idered how I &s;hould ar|range my new apartment. With a clean napkin I covered a little paltry table, which I placed near my window, intending that it &s;hould &s;erve me for a bureau, and re&s;olved to eat my meals on a corner of the chim|ney-piece, that I might keep the table clean, and in order, for writing. Two large hat-pins, &s;tuck into the boards, &s;erved me as a port manteau. In my pocket I had Thom&s;on's Sea&s;ons, a work which I was fond of on more than one account; and I made a memo|randum of &s;uch other books as I &s;hould wi&s;h to pro|cure. Fir&s;t, Plutarch's Lives of Illu&s;trious Per&s;ons&punc; which at eight years of age I u&s;ed to carry to church in&s;tead of the Exerci&s;es of the holy week, and which I had not read regularly &s;ince that early period <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then Hume's Hi&s;tory of England, and Sheridan's Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tionary,

in order to improve my&s;elf in the Engli&s;h lan|guage. I would rather have continued to read Mrs. Macaulay; but the per&s;on who had lent me &s;ome of the fir&s;t volumes, was not at home; and I &s;hould not have known where to enquire for the work, as I had already tried in vain to get it from the book|&s;ellers. I could not avoid &s;miling at my peaceful prepara|tions; for there was a great tumult in the town: the drums were continually beating to arms, and I knew not what might be the event. At any rate, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, they will not prevent my living to my la&s;t moment: more happy in my con&s;cious innocence, than they can be with the rage that animates them. If they come, I will advance to meet them, and go to death as a man would go to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE keeper's wife came to invite me to her apart|ment, where &s;he had directed my cloth to be laid, that I might dine in better air. On repairing thither, I found my faithful maid, who threw her&s;elf into my arms, bathed in tears, and half &s;uffocated by her &s;obs. I could not avoid melting into tenderne&s;s and &s;orrow. I almo&s;t upbraided my&s;elf with my previous tranquillity, when I reflected on the anxiety of tho&s;e who were at|tached to me; and when I de&s;cribed to my&s;elf the an|gui&s;h fir&s;t of one friend, and then of another, my heart was rent by the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ations of grief. Poor wo|man! how many tears have I cau&s;ed her to &s;hed! and for what does not an attachment like her's atone? In the common intercour&s;e of life &s;he &s;ometimes treats me roughly, but it is when &s;he thinks me too negligent of what may contribute to my health or happine&s;s; and when I am in di&s;tre&s;s, the office of complaining is her's,
<PB N="42" REF="034483_0040_0FFDE893BB1C2038">
and that of con&s;oling mine. There was no getting rid of &s;o inveterate a habit. I endeavoured to prove to her that, by giving way to her grief, &s;he would be le&s;s ca|pable of rendering me &s;ervice; that &s;he was more u&s;e|ful to me without, than within the walls of the pri&s;on, where &s;he begged me to permit her to remain; and that, upon the whole, I was far from being &s;o unfortunate as &s;he imagined, which indeed was true. Whenever I have been ill, I have experienced a particular kind of &s;erenity, un|que&s;tionably proceeding from my mode of contemplat|ing things, and from the law I have laid down for my|&s;elf, of always &s;ubmitting quietly to nece&s;&s;ity, in&s;tead of revolting again&s;t it. The moment I take to my bed, every duty &s;eems at an end, and no &s;olicitude whatever has any hold upon me: I am only bound to be there, and to remain there with re&s;ignation, which I do with a very good grace. I give freedom to my imagination; I call up agreeable impre&s;&s;ions, plea&s;ing remembrances, and ideas of happine&s;s; all exertions, all rea&s;onings, and all calculations, I di&s;card; giving my&s;elf up entirely to na|ture, and, peaceful like her, I &s;uffer pain without impati|ence, and &s;eek repo&s;e or cheerfulne&s;s. I find that impri&s;on|ment produces on me nearly the &s;ame effect as di&s;ea&s;e; I am only bound to be in pri&s;on, and what great hard&s;hip is there in it? I am not &s;uch very bad company for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I SOON learnt that I mu&s;t change my habitation.&mdash; Victims were abundant, and the chamber into which I had been put would contain more than one bed.&mdash; That I might be alone, I was obliged in the evening to be &s;hut up in a little clo&s;et; and con&s;equently to remove the whole of my e&s;tabli&s;hment. The

All the night I heard, <HI>Who goes there?&mdash;kill him!&mdash;guard!&mdash;patrole!</HI>&mdash; called out in a thundering voice. The hou&s;es were illuminated; and from the number and frequency of the patroles it was ea&s;y to infer, there had been &s;ome commotions, and that more were to be feared. I ro&s;e early, and employed my&s;elf in my hou&s;ehold affairs; that is to &s;ay, in making my bed, in cleaning my little place, and in rendering my per&s;on and every thing about me as neat as I could. Had I de&s;ired the&s;e things to be done for me, I knew that I &s;hould not have been re|fu&s;ed; but I was aware, I mu&s;t have paid for them dearly, waited a long time, and had them done in a very &s;lovenly manner at la&s;t. By taking the office on my&s;elf I was &s;ure to be a gainer: I was &s;ure that I &s;hould be better and &s;ooner &s;erved, and that the trifling pre&s;ents I might make would be rated the higher, becau&s;e they would be altogether gratuitous. I waited with impatience to hear the ma&s;&s;y bolts of my door opened, that I might a&s;k for a new&s;paper. I read it: the decree of impeach|ment again&s;t the twenty-two was pa&s;&s;ed: the paper fell from my hands, and in tran&s;port of grief I exclaimed, 'My country is undone!'</P>
<P>FIRM and tranquil, while I imagined my&s;elf alone, or nearly alone, beneath the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, I formed wi&s;hes for the future, and was not without hope that the defenders of liberty would triumph. But guilt and error have obtained the a&s;cendancy; the national repre&s;entation is violated; its integrity is de&s;troyed; every one in it remarkable for probity, &s;pirit, and talents, is pro&s;cribed; the commune of Paris overawes the legi&s;lative body;

Liberty, &s;aid I, has two &s;ources; good manners, which produce &s;age laws; and knowledge, which leads us to both, by making us acquainted with our rights: my &s;oul will no longer be afflicted by the &s;pectacle of mankind deba&s;ed: the human race will improve; and the happine&s;s of all will become the foun|dation and the &s;ecurity of that of each individual.

<P>THE cour&s;e of things ought to have made me fore&s;ee the event: but I could not ea&s;ily bring my&s;elf to believe, that the bulk of the convention would not pau&s;e at the magnitude of the danger; nor could I help being a&s;toni&s;hed at the deci&s;ive act, which tolled its pa&s;&s;ing bell.</P>

<P>SEVERAL days elap&s;ed without my hearing any thing and &s;till I underwent no examination. I had however received a great many vi&s;its from admini&s;trators with fooli&s;h faces and dirty ribbands, &s;ome of whom &s;aid they belonged to the police, others to I know not what; violent &s;ans-culottes, with filthy hair, and &s;trict ob&s;ervers of the order of the day, who came to know whether the pri|&s;oners were &s;atisfied with their treatment. I had ex+pre&s;&s;ed

my&s;elf to them all with the energy and dignity &s;ui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ble to oppre&s;&s;ed innocence; and had noticed among the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two or three men of good &s;en&s;e, who under&s;tood me, with|out daring to take my part. I was at dinner, when five or &s;ix were announced to me all at once. One came a little forward: he, who a&s;&s;umed the office of &s;peaker, appeared to me, before he opened his lips, one of tho&s;e empty-headed babblers, who judge of their merit by the volubility of their tongue.&mdash;'Good morrow, <HI>Citoyenne.</HI>'&mdash;'Good morrow, &s;ir.'&mdash;Are you &s;atisfied with this hou&s;e?

<PB N="48" REF="034483_0046_0FFDE8A3C9530DF0">
might go a great way, before they would find dolts like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I HAVE already mentioned my having inquired into the way of living in the&s;e places. Not that I &s;et any great value on what are called the comforts of life. I make no &s;cruple of enjoying them when it can be done without inconvenience, but it is always in moderation; and when it is nece&s;&s;ary, there is no one of them that I cannot forego. It is from a natural love of order that I de&s;ire to know the amount of my expences, and to regulate them according to the circum&s;tances of my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I WAS informed that Roland, when mini&s;ter, thought that five livres [4s. 2d.] a head, the daily allowance of the pri&s;oners, a great deal too much, and reduced it to two [1s. 8d.]: but the exce&s;&s;ive ri&s;e in the price of provi|&s;ions, which within the&s;e few months has been tripled, ren|ders this allowance &s;canty enough: for the nation allowing nothing but &s;traw and the bare walls, twenty &s;ous [10d.] are deducted in the fir&s;t place, as an indemnification to the keeper for his expen&s;es, that is to &s;ay, for the bed and trifling furniture of the room. Out of the twenty &s;ous remaining, candles, fire, if nece&s;&s;ary, and meat and drink, are to be provided. The &s;um is in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e; but every pri&s;oner is free, of cour&s;e, to make what addition he plea&s;es to his expen&s;e. As I am not fond of &s;pending much on my&s;elf; and take a plea&s;ure in trying my &s;trength at privation, I felt a de&s;ire of making an experiment how far the human will is ca|pable of dimini&s;hing our wants; but to go any great length, it is nece&s;&s;ary to proceed by degrees. At the end of four days, I began by retrenching my breakfa&s;t, and
<PB N="49" REF="034483_0047_0FFDE8A55A615B60">
&s;ub&s;tituting bread and water for coffee and chocolate: I de&s;ired to have for dinner one plain di&s;h of meat, with a few greens; and vegetables for my &s;upper without a de&s;ert. To break my&s;elf of drinking wine, I took fir&s;t to beer, and then I left off that al&s;o. As this re|gimen, however, had a moral purpo&s;e, and as I have as much aver&s;ion as contempt for u&s;ele&s;s economy, I began by giving a certain &s;um for the u&s;e of the mi&s;erable wretch|es, who were lying upon &s;traw; that, while eating my dry bread in a morning, I might have the &s;atisfaction to reflect, that the poor devils would owe to me their being able to add &s;omething to their's at dinner. If I remain here &s;ix months, I will engage to leave the place with a healthy complexion, and a body by no means emaciated, having reduced my wants &s;o far as to be &s;atisfied with &s;oup and bread, and de&s;erved a few benedictions <HI>incognito.</HI> I made &s;ome pre&s;ents al&s;o, but with quite a different view, to the &s;ervants belonging to the pri&s;on. When a per&s;on is, or appears to be, rigidly economical in point of expen&s;e, he ought to be generous to others, if he would wi&s;h to avoid blame, particularly when the people about him derive from that expen&s;e their only emolument. I require neither attentions to be paid me, nor purcha&s;es to be made on my account; I &s;end out for nothing; I employ nobody: I &s;hould be con&s;equently the wor&s;t of pri&s;oners to the dome&s;tics, who make their little profits on what they are commi&s;&s;ioned to provide or procure: it is fitting therefore, that I &s;hould pay for the &s;tate of independence in which I place my&s;elf: by &s;o doing I render it more perfect, and am moreover a gainer in good will.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="034483_0048_0FFDE8A93B1E5E70">I HAVE received &s;everal vi&s;its from the excellent Cham|paneux and the worthy Bo&s;c. The former, father of a numerous family, was attached to liberty from principle, and had profe&s;&s;ed its &s;ound doctrines from the very commencement of the revolution, in a journal, intended for the information of his fellow citizens. A good judgment, gentlene&s;s of manners, and great indu&s;try, are the mo&s;t prominent features of his character. Roland, when mini&s;ter, placed him at the head of the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the home department; and it was one of the be&s;t appointments he made: though by the way he was not le&s;s happy in other principal clerks, &s;uch as the active and ingenuous Camus, the able F&eacute;poul, and &s;e|veral more. Never were offices better filled; nor could any thing but their excellent organization enable Garat to &s;upport a burden &s;o far beyond his &s;trength. It is to the hone&s;ty and capacity of &s;uch agents that he is indebted for the tranquillity he is allowed to enjoy. Of this he is &s;en&s;ible; and he &s;aid with good rea&s;on, that he would give up his &s;ituation, if he were obliged to make any change in his official e&s;tabli&s;hment. Notwith&s;tanding this, he will be forced to quit his po&s;t, for no talents in a&s;&s;i&s;tants can compen&s;ate a mini&s;ter's want of firmne&s;s: irre&s;olution is the wor&s;t of faults in tho&s;e who govern, particularly in the mid&s;t of jarring factions. Garat and Barr&egrave;re, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> private individuals, would not be deemed deficient in &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or hone&s;ty: but the one charged with the executive power, and the other empowered to legi&s;late, would r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the &s;tates in the world by their half-mea&s;ures: th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rage for what they term conciliatory plans propels th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in that oblique path, which leads directly to mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

and confu&s;ion. There would be nothing conciliatory about a &s;tate&s;man but his manner; I mean his mode of behaviour to tho&s;e whom he employs; he ought to avail him&s;elf of the very pa&s;&s;ions and faults of tho&s;e who&s;e conduct he directs, or with whom he tran&s;acts bu&s;ine&s;s: but rigid in his principles, firm and rapid in action, no ob&s;tacle, no con&s;ideration, &s;hould make him waver in the former re&s;pect, or alter his cour&s;e in the latter.</P>
<P>COULD Roland unite with his exten&s;ive views, his &s;trength of mind, and his prodigious activity, a little more artfulne&s;s of manner, he would ea&s;ily govern an empire: but his faults are prejudicial to him&s;elf alone, while his good qualities are infinitely valuable in the admini&s;tration of public affairs.</P>
<P>BOSC, our old friend, a man of an ingenious di&s;po&s;i|tion, and enlightened mind, came to me the fir&s;t day of my impri&s;onment, and lo&s;t no time in conducting my daughter to madame Creuz&eacute;-la-Touche, who gave her a kind welcome, and treated her like one of her own chil|dren, with whom it was &s;ettled that &s;he &s;hould remain un|der her fo&s;tering care. To be fully &s;en&s;ible of the value of this &s;tep, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be acquainted with the per&s;ons. It is nece&s;&s;ary for a man to de&s;cribe to him&s;elf the feeling and open-hearted Bo&s;c, running to the hou&s;e of his friends, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their child, and intru&s;ting her of his own accord to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable family, as a depo&s;it which he felt him&s;elf honoured in confiding to their hands, and which he knew would be received with the plea&s;ure experienced by delicate minds, when an opportunity is offered them of doing good. It is
<PB N="52" REF="034483_0050_0FFDE8AFB08C48A0">
nece&s;&s;ary to have been acquainted with the patriarchal man|ners, the dome&s;tic virtues of Creuz&eacute; and his wife, and with the gentlene&s;s and goodne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition for which they are remarkable, to judge of the welcome they gave my girl, and to be &s;en&s;ible of what it was worth.</P>
<P>WHO, then, is to be pitied in all this? Roland alone; Roland, per&s;ecuted and pro&s;cribed; Roland, to whom the examination of his accounts is denied; Roland, com|pelled to conceal him&s;elf like a criminal; to avoid the blind fury of men mi&s;led by his enemies; to tremble for the &s;afety even of tho&s;e who give him &s;helter; to drink in &s;ilence the bitter cup of his wife's impri&s;onment, and of the &s;eque&s;tration of all his property; and to await, in a &s;tate of incertitude, the reign of ju&s;tice, which can ne|ver indemnify him for all that perver&s;ity will have made him &s;uffer.</P>
<P>MY &s;ection, actuated by the be&s;t principles, had come on the third of the month to a re&s;olution, which breathed the &s;pirit of ju&s;tice, and which e&s;tabli&s;hed the right of citizens, to prote&s;t again&s;t arbitrary impri&s;onment, and even to re&s;i&s;t it if attempted. My letter was read there, and li&s;tened to with concern. The debate, that took place in con&s;equence, having been prolonged to the next day, the mountaineers laid their heads together: the alarm was given to their party; and a whole ho&s;t of furious depu|ties arrived from the other &s;ections, with a view to di&s;turb the proceedings, and deliberations, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to pervert the &s;pirit of mine, or el&s;e in the hope of terrifying it by menaces, and of engaging a majority of the &s;ections to deprive it of its arms.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, being urged by Grandpr&eacute; to neglect
<PB N="53" REF="034483_0051_0FFDE8B14608FF88">
no means of &s;hortening the term of my captivity, I wrote again to Garat, and to Gohier al&s;o. The latter, whom I &s;carcely ever &s;aw or knew, with at lea&s;t as much weakne&s;s as Garat, appeared to me inferior to him in every other re|&s;pect. I could not ea&s;ily write to &s;uch men, without giving them le&s;&s;ons; and they were &s;evere. Grandpr&eacute; thinking them mortifying, though ju&s;t, I &s;oftened &s;ome of the ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and contented my&s;elf with the following words:

<P>WHAT atrocious wickedne&s;s! and what exce&s;s of im|pudence! The deputies here named are preci&s;ely tho&s;e, who voted for the bani&s;hment of the Bourbons. Tho&s;e high-&s;pirited defenders of freedom never con&s;idered d'Or|leans as a leader po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of capacity; but he always appeared to them a dangerous tool. They were the fir&s;t to dread his vices, his wealth, his connexions, his popu|larity, and his faction; to denounce the latter, and to hunt down tho&s;e, who appeared to be its agents. Lou|vet marked them out in his Philippic again&s;t Robe&s;|pierre; a valuable piece, as is every thing from his pen. In that compo&s;ition, which hi&s;tory will carefully pre|&s;erve, he follows them &s;tep by &s;tep to the electoral a&s;&s;embly, whence d'Orleans i&s;&s;ued a deputy. Buzot, who&s;e per&s;evering energy has procured him the hatred of the factious, embraced the fir&s;t favourable opportunity, to demand the bani&s;hment of the Bourbons; a mea|&s;ure which he looked upon as indi&s;pen&s;able, from the moment the convention re&s;olved to pa&s;s judg|ment on Lewis. Neither Roland, nor I, ever &s;aw d'Orleans. I even refu&s;ed to receive Sillery, thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

he was mentioned to me as a good and amiable man, becau&s;e his connection with d'Orleans rendered him &s;u&s;picious. I remember two curious letters on the &s;ubject; one of which was written by madame Sillery to Louvet, after he had &s;upported Buzot's motion. 'Here,' &s;aid Louvet, communicating the letter to me, 'is a proof that we are not mi&s;taken, and that the Orleans party is no chimera. Madame Sillery would not write in &s;uch terms, if it were not a thing agreed upon between her and the parties concerned. If they be &s;o much afraid of bani&s;hment, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e exile will defeat &s;ome of their &s;chemes.' In fact, the object of the &s;tudied letter of madame Sillery was to prevail upon Louvet to change his opinion; to per&s;uade him, that the republican principles, in which the children of d'Orleans had been educated, rendered them the mo&s;t zealous partizans of a commonwealth; and that it was both cruel and impolitic to &s;acrifice individuals, who might certainly be made u&s;eful, to prejudices alike unju&s;t and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>The other letter was Louvet's an&s;wer: replete with wit and dignity, it &s;et forth the rea&s;ons on which he founded his opinion in terms equally forcible and polite. Among other things he &s;aid, that the monarchical principles, the ari&s;to|cratical and other prejudices, which appeared in the works of madame Sillery her&s;elf, were far from &s;atisfying him with re&s;pect to tho&s;e of her pupils; and he per&s;i&s;ted with all the &s;pirit of a free man in an opinion which the love of his country in&s;pired.</P>
<P>As to the pretended cabals at Buzot's wife's, nothing in the world can be &s;o ridiculous. Buzot, whom I had frequent occa&s;ions of &s;eeing at the time of the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly,

The &s;imple manners, natural negligence, and frankne&s;s of Bri&s;&s;ot, appeared to me in perfect harmony with the au&s;terity of his prin|ciples; but I found in him a &s;ort of levity of mind and di&s;po&s;ition, which was not equally &s;uitable to the gravity of a philo&s;opher. This always gave me pain, and of this his enemies never failed to take advantage. In proportion as I became more acquainted with him, I e&s;teemed him the more. It is not in human nature to combine more complete di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s with greater zeal for the public welfare, or to pur&s;ue the general good with more entire forgetfulne&s;s of private intere&s;t: but his writings are better fitted to effectuate it than his per&s;on; for <HI>they</HI> carry with them all the authority, which rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and intelligence can give; while in per&s;on he can a&s;&s;ume none, for want of dignity.

Born at Chartres, and a &s;chool-fellow of P&eacute;tion, who is a native of the &s;ame town, Bri&s;&s;ot became &s;till more inti|mate with him in the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, where his labours and information were often of u&s;e to his friend. He made us acquainted with him, as well as with &s;everal other members, whom old habits of friend&s;hip, or the mere &s;imilitude of principles, and zeal for the public good, brought often together to compare their views. It was even agreed upon, that they &s;hould meet at my apartment four evenings in the week, becau&s;e I was a very dome&s;tic, and could afford them good ac|commodations, and becau&s;e my lodgings were &s;o &s;itu|ated, as to be at no great di&s;tance from any of the per|&s;ons who compo&s;ed the little club.</P>
<P>THIS arrangement &s;uited me perfectly: it made me acquainted with the progre&s;s of public affairs, in which I felt my&s;elf deeply intere&s;ted; and favoured my ta&s;te for pur&s;uing political &s;peculations, and &s;tudying mankind. I knew what part became one of my &s;ex, and never &s;tepped out of it. The political debates pa&s;&s;ed in my pre&s;ence, without my taking any part. Sitting at a table without the circle, I employed my&s;elf in working at my needle, or writing letters, while they were deliberating; and yet if I di&s;patched ten epi&s;tles, which was &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, I did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle &s;yllable of what was &s;aying, and more than once bit my lips, to re&s;train my impatience to &s;peak.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;truck me mo&s;t, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me exceedingly, was that &s;ort of light and frivolous chit-chat, in which men of &s;en&s;e pa&s;s three or four hours, without coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any conclu&s;ion.

&s;tarted, and &s;ome good plans propo&s;ed; but upon bring|ing the whole together, there appeared to be no path marked out, no fixed re&s;ult, nor any determinate point, towards which it was agreed upon that each per&s;on &s;hould direct his views.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES for very vexation I could have boxed the ears of the&s;e philo&s;ophers, whom I daily learnt to e&s;teem more and more for the hone&s;ty of their hearts, and the purity of their intentions: excellent rea&s;oners all, and all philo&s;ophers, and learned politicians in theory; but being totally ignorant of the art of managing mankind, and con|&s;equently of &s;waying an a&s;&s;embly, their wit and learning were generally lavi&s;hed to no end.</P>
<P>AND yet I have known &s;ome good decrees thus plan|ned, which have afterwards pa&s;&s;ed. But &s;oon the coa|lition of the minority of the nobility compleatly weaken|ed the <HI>left &s;ide,</HI> and produced the evils attendant on a re|vi&s;al of the con&s;titution. There remained but a &s;mall number of inflexible men, who dur&s;t contend for prin|ciples; and towards the conclu&s;ion, the&s;e were reduced to little more than Buzot, P&eacute;tion, and Robe&s;pierre.</P>
<P>AT that time Robe&s;pierre had to me the &s;emblance of an hone&s;t man; and for the &s;ake of his principles I for|gave the defects of his language, and his tire&s;ome way of &s;peaking. I had, however, remarked, that he was always re&s;erved in the&s;e committees, hearing the opinions of all, and &s;eldom giving his own, or when he did, not being at the pains to &s;et forth the rea&s;ons on which it was grounded. I have been told, that the next day he was the fir&s;t to mount the tribune, and to avail him&s;elf of the argu|ments which the evening before he had heard delivered
<PB N="68" REF="034483_0066_0FFDE8D9B790F1F0">
by his friends. When he was &s;ometimes gently reproved for this conduct, he would get off by a joke; and his artifice was forgotten, as the effect of that devouring &s;elf-love, by which he was &s;o cruelly tormented. This how|ever was in &s;ome degree de&s;tructive of confidence; for if any expedient were to be devi&s;ed, any mode of proceed|ing to be determined upon, and any ca&s;t of parts to be adopted in con&s;equence, there could never be any cer|tainty that Robe&s;pierre would not come, as it were in a freak, and thwart the bu&s;ine&s;s; or el&s;e with a view of a&s;cribing the honour to him&s;elf, bring forward the affair incon&s;iderately, and by &s;o doing ruin all. Per&s;uaded at that time that Robe&s;pierre was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of liberty, I was inclined to atribute his faults to an exce&s;s of fiery zeal. That kind of re&s;erve, which &s;eems to in|dicate either the fear of being &s;een through, becau&s;e we can get nothing by being known, or the di&s;tru&s;t of a man who can find no rea&s;on in his own bo&s;om, for giving others credit for virtue; that kind of re&s;erve, for which Robe&s;pierre is remarkable, gave me pain; but I mi&s;took it for mode&s;ty. Thus it is that, with a fa|vourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we transform the mo&s;t untoward indications into &s;ymptoms of the mo&s;t amiable qualities. Never did the &s;mile of confidence re&s;t on the lips of Robe&s;pierre, while they were almo&s;t always contracted by the malignant grin of envy, &s;triving to a&s;&s;ume the fea|tures of di&s;dain. His talents, as an orator, were below mediocrity; his vulgar voice, ill cho&s;en expre&s;&s;ions, and faulty pronunciation, rendering his di&s;cour&s;e extremely tire&s;ome, but he maintained principles with warmth and per&s;everence; and there was &s;ome courage in con|tinuing to do &s;o, at a time when the defenders of the
<PB N="69" REF="034483_0067_0FFDE8DC963B7B88">
cau&s;e of the people were greatly dimini&s;hed in number. The court dete&s;ted and calumniated them: to &s;upport and encourage them, was therefore the duty of a patriot. I e&s;teemed Robe&s;pierre on this account; I told him as much; and even when he was not very a&s;&s;iduous at the little club, he occa&s;ionally came to take his dinner at our hou&s;e. I had been much &s;truck with the terror that &s;eemed to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind on the day of the king's flight to Varennes. That afternoon I found him at P&eacute;ti|on's, where he &s;aid with great alarm, that the royal family would never have taken &s;uch a &s;tep, without having a coalition in Paris, to direct a ma&s;&s;acre of the patriots; and that he did not expect to live four and twenty hours. P&eacute;tion and Bri&s;&s;ot on the contrary &s;aid, that the flight would be the king's ruin, and that it ought be turned to good account: they ob&s;erved that the people were per|fectly well di&s;po&s;ed, and would be more clearly convinced of the treachery of the court by this &s;tep, than they would have been by the able&s;t publications: that this &s;ingle fact rendered it evident to all, that the king was adver&s;e to the con&s;titution, which he had &s;worn to maintain; that this was the moment to &s;ecure a more homogenous form of govern|ment; and that it would be proper to prepare men's minds for a republic. Robe&s;pierre, with his u&s;ual &s;neer, and biting his nails, a&s;ked what was a republic? The plan of a paper entitled the Republican, of which two numbers only were publi&s;hed, was then devi&s;ed. Du|mont of Geneva, a man of con&s;iderable abilities, was the editor; du Ch&aacute;telet, an officer in the army, lent his name; and Condorcet, Bri&s;&s;ot, and others, were pre|paring to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;eizure of the king's
<PB N="70" REF="034483_0068_0FFDE8DF4550F258">
per&s;on gave Robe&s;pierre great plea&s;ure; he &s;aw in it the prevention of much mi&s;chief, and laid a&s;ide the fears he entertained on his own account; but the re&s;t of the party were &s;orry for the event: they were of opinion that it was bringing back a pe&s;t into the government; that in|triguing would revive; and that the efferve&s;cence of the public mind, allayed by the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the culprit detained, would no longer &s;erve to &s;econd the efforts of the friends of freedom. They judged aright; and with the le&s;s ri&s;k of being mi&s;taken, as the reconciliation of Lafayette with the Lameths proved the exi&s;tence of a new coalition, which could not have the public good for its foundation. It was impo&s;&s;ible to counterbalance it, unle&s;s by the force of opinion di&s;played in a powerful manner; for which the patriots never had more than their pens, and their voices; but when any popular commotion came to their aid, they welcomed it with plea&s;ure, without inquiring how it was produced, or giving them&s;elves much trouble about it. There was behind the curtain a party, whom the ari&s;tocrats accu&s;ed with &s;o much vehemence, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the patriots not to be tempted to forgive him, &s;o long as they perceived nothing, but what might be made to contribute to the public advantage: be&s;ides, they could not per&s;uade them&s;elves that the per&s;on in que&s;tion was any way formi|dable.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to command our pa&s;&s;ions in the time of a revolution: there is indeed no in&s;tance, of one accom|pli&s;hed without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Great ob&s;tacles are to be overcome; and this cannot be effected without as ardour, and a devotion to the cau&s;e, bordering upon e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+thu&s;ia&s;m, or tending to produce it. Hence it is that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="71" REF="034483_0069_0FFDE8E1ECE4AD00">
gra&s;p with avidity at every thing that &s;eems to &s;erve our purpo&s;e, and lo&s;e the faculty of perceiving what may prove injurious. Hence that confidence, that eagerne&s;s to avail our&s;elves of a &s;udden movement, without tracing it to it's origin, in order to know how to direct it aright: and hence the indelicacy, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, of &s;uffering the co-operation of agents whom we do not e&s;teem, but who&s;e proceedings we tolerate, becau&s;e they appear to tend the &s;ame way as our own. D'Orleans &s;tanding &s;ingly was &s;urely not to be feared; but his name, his connexions, his wealth, and his advi&s;ers, gave him great influence; and he unque&s;tionably acted a &s;ecret part in all popular commotions. Men of pure intentions &s;u&s;pected him: but all this they con&s;idered as a fermen|tation nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et the inert ma&s;s a working: they contented them&s;elves with taking no &s;hare in them, and flattered them&s;elves, that they &s;hould make every thing turn to the advantage of the public: they were, be&s;ides, more inclined to a&s;cribe to d'Orleans the de&s;ire of reveng|ing him&s;elf on a court, by which he had been de&s;pi&s;ed, and which he was inclined to humble, than any de&s;ign of his own elevation.</P>
<P>THE jacobins propo&s;ed a petition to the a&s;&s;embly, re|que&s;ting it to pa&s;s judgment on the traitor who had fled, or to take the &s;en&s;e of the nation concerning the treat|ment he might de&s;erve; and in the mean time to declare, that he had lo&s;t the confidence of the people of Paris. Laclos, that Laclos &s;o remarkable for the powers of his mind, whom nature formed for the management of great affairs, but who&s;e vices had made him dedicate all his faculties to intrigue; Laclos, devoted to d'Orleans, and of great weight in his council, made this propo&s;al to the

I &s;aw them arrive. The &s;ociety de|liberated in the pre&s;ence of that mob, who were al&s;o al|lowed to give their votes; &s;ettled the fundamentnl points of the petition; and appointed a committee to draw it up, of which Laclos and Bri&s;&s;ot were members. They were bu&s;ied about it till a late hour of the night: for it had been re&s;olved, that a deputation of the &s;ociety &s;hould on the following day carry it to the Champ-de-Mars, there to be &s;hown to all, who might wi&s;h to examine or to &s;ign it. Laclos pretended that he had a head-ach pro|ceeding from want of &s;leep, which would not &s;uffer him to hold the pen: he therefore reque&s;ted Bri&s;&s;ot to take it; and, while conver&s;ing with him about the compo&s;ition, propo&s;ed, for the la&s;t article, &s;ome clau&s;e, I know not what, which called for the re&s;toration of royalty, and opened a road for d'Orleans to the throne. Bri&s;&s;ot re|jected it with warmth and a&s;toni&s;hment; and the other, like an able politician, gave it up, under the pretence of his not having &s;ufficiently con&s;idered its con&s;equences: well aware, that he &s;hould &s;till find means to get it foi&s;t|ed in; which in fact he did, &s;ince it made part of a printed paper that was di&s;per&s;ed as the plan agreed upon by the jacobins. But when the &s;ociety which a&s;&s;embled the next morning to examine the draught of
<PB N="73" REF="034483_0071_0FFDE8E74E09D770">
the petition, and &s;end it away, was informed, that the national a&s;&s;embly had decided on the fate of the king, it di&s;patched its commi&s;&s;ioners to the Champ-de-Mars, to inform the people, that the decree re&s;pecting the king having pa&s;&s;ed, there was no longer any occa&s;ion for the intended petition. My curio&s;ity had carried me to the <HI>Champ-de-la-federation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new name of the Champ de Mars. <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, where there were not more than two or three hundred per&s;ons &s;cattered about the environs of the national altar, upon which deputies of the cordeliers, and of the fraternal &s;ocieties, bearing pikes with pompous in&s;criptions, &s;tood haranguing &s;mall groups, and exciting their indignation again&s;t Lewis XVI. It was &s;aid, that as the jacobins had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their petition, it was proper that &s;uch citizens as were zealous in the people's cau&s;e &s;hould draw up another, and a&s;&s;emble for that purpo&s;e on the en|&s;uing day. Then it was that the parti&s;ans of the court, feel|ing the nece&s;&s;ity of employing terror, concerted the means of &s;triking a deci&s;ive blow. They prepared their mea|&s;ures accordingly; and the unexpected proclamation of martial law, and its prompt execution, produced what has been ju&s;tly called the <HI>ma&s;&s;acre of the Champ-de-Mars.</HI> The terrified people dur&s;t not &s;tir, while part of the national guard, &s;educed or deceived, &s;econded Lafayette, either out of ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s to the court, or blind confidence in his pretended patrioti&s;m, and &s;erved as a rampart again&s;t their fellow-citizens; the &s;tandard of death was di&s;played from the town-hall; and the revi&s;ion of the con&s;titution was effected under its influence. The formation of the club of <HI>Feuillans</HI> had been planned much about the &s;ame

time, to weaken the jacobins; and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the whole proceedings of the coalition at that period, proved how much the court and its parti&s;ans were &s;uperior to their adver&s;aries in weaving a ti&s;&s;ue of intrigues.</P>
<P>I NEVER knew affright comparable to that of Robe&s;|pierre under the&s;e circum&s;tances. There was indeed a ru|mour of putting him on his trial, which was probably meant only to intimidate him; and it was &s;aid, that there was a plot at the Feuillans both again&s;t him, and the committee, who drew up the petition at the jacobins. Ro|land and I were really unea&s;y on his account, and drove to his hou&s;e, at the farther end of the <HI>Marais,</HI> at eleven at night to offer him an a&s;ylum: but he had already quitted his habitation. Thence we proceeded to Buzot's to tell him, that perhaps it would not be ami&s;s, if without leaving the &s;ociety of the jacobins, he were to enter into that of the Feuillans, in order to &s;ee what was going forward, and to be ready to defend tho&s;e whom they might wi&s;h to per&s;ecute.

the a&s;&s;embly, and there I &s;hall at all times be ready to undertake his defence. As to the Jacobins, where I have been little of late, becau&s;e my regard for our &s;pecies makes me grieve to &s;ee it more than u&s;ually hideous in that noi&s;y a&s;&s;embly, I &s;hall be con&s;tant in my attendance, as long as the per&s;ecution is kept up again&s;t a &s;ociety, which I believe to be u&s;eful to the cau&s;e of freedom.' The&s;e words of Buzot were exactly de&s;criptive of the man: he acts, as he &s;peaks, with truth and rectitude, the &s;tricte&s;t probity, adorned with the plea&s;ing forms of &s;en&s;ibility, being the leading feature of his character. He had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in our little committee, by the &s;oundne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, and by that decided man|ner which be&s;peaks a man of integrity. As he lived at no great di&s;tance from our hou&s;e; and his wife, though &s;he did not appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s a mind congenial to his, was an affable woman; we vi&s;ited each other frequently. When the &s;ucce&s;s of Roland's mi&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to the debt of the commune of Lyons allowed us to return to Beaujolois, we kept up a corre&s;pondence with Buzot and Robe&s;pierre. That with the former was the more re|gular: there was a greater familiarity between us, a wider foundation for friend&s;hip, and a rich &s;tock of materials to keep it from flagging. Our friend&s;hip became inti|mate and unalterable. El&s;ewhere I &s;hall &s;ay how this connection grew clo&s;er &s;till.</P>
<P>ROLAND's mi&s;&s;ion having detained him &s;even months at Paris, we quitted that city in the middle of Sept. after his obtaining every thing for Lyons that it could de&s;ire; and &s;pent the autumn in the country, employed in the vintage.</P>
<P>ONE of the la&s;t acts of the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly was the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of in&s;pectors. We con&s;idered, whether we
<PB N="76" REF="034483_0074_0FFDE8EF57EBA840">
&s;hould determine to remain in the country, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would be better to go and pa&s;s the winter in Paris, where Roland might prefer his claim to a pen&s;ion, as a reward for forty years &s;ervice; and at the &s;ame time con+tinue his labours for the Encyclopedia, which he would be &s;ure to find more ea&s;y in the focus of &s;cience, amid&s;t arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and men of letters, than in the depth of a de&s;ert.</P>
<P>WE came back to Paris in the month of December. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the members of the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly had returned to their &s;everal homes; and P&eacute;tion, who had been cho&s;en mayor, was wholly occupied with the cares of that office, we no longer had any rallying point, and &s;aw Bri&s;&s;ot him&s;elf much le&s;s frequently than before. The whole of our attention was concentrated at home. Roland's active mind in&s;pired him with the idea of e&s;tabli&s;hing a journal of u&s;eful arts; and by the charms of &s;tudy we en|deavoured to divert our attention from public affairs, which &s;eemed to be in a lamentable &s;tate. Several de|puties of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly u&s;ed however to me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ometimes at the apartments which one of them oc|cupied in the <HI>Place Vendome;</HI> and Roland, who&s;e patriot|i&s;m and knowledge were held in high e&s;teem, was in|vited to make one of the party: but he di&s;liked the di&s;tance, and &s;eldom went. One of our friends, who was frequently there, informed us, about the middle of March, that the court, full of alarm and perplexity, was de&s;irous of doing &s;omething to regain its popularity; that it would have no great objection to appoint jacobin mini&s;ters; and that the patriots were bu&s;ied in endea|vouring to make the choice fall upon men of &s;teadine&s;s and ability; which was of the more importance, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> might only be a &s;nare on the part of the court, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="77" REF="034483_0075_0FFDE8F203B7DFB0">
would not be &s;orry to have wrong-headed per&s;ons forced upon it, who might become ju&s;t objects of complaint or deri&s;ion. He added, that &s;everal per&s;ons had turned their thoughts towards Roland, who&s;e rank in the republic of letters, admini&s;trative knowledge, and reputation for ju&s;|tice and vigour of mind, afforded a pro&s;pect of &s;tability. Roland at that time went frequently to the jacobin &s;ociety, and was one of the per&s;ons employed in its committee of corre&s;pondence. The idea however &s;eemed to me to be vi&s;ionary, and made but little impre&s;&s;ion on my mind.</P>
<P>THE 21&s;t of the &s;ame month, Bri&s;&s;ot called upon me in the evening, and repeated the &s;ame thing in a more po&s;itive manner; a&s;king at the &s;ame time whether Roland would con&s;ent to take &s;uch a burden on him. I &s;aid in an&s;wer, that, having mentioned the matter to him in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, when the idea was fir&s;t &s;tarted, it had ap|peared to me that after taking all the difficulties and danger into the account, his zeal and activity would not object to &s;uch a field for exertion; but that it was a bu&s;ine&s;s which required further con&s;ideration. Roland did not &s;hrink from the ta&s;k: the idea he entertained of his own abilities in&s;pired him with a hope of being &s;erviceable to the cau&s;e of freedom and to his country: and &s;uch was the an&s;wer that was given to Bri&s;&s;ot on the following day.</P>
<P>ON Friday, the 23d, at eleven in the evening, I &s;aw him walk into our department with Dumouriez; who came on the breaking up of the council, to inform Roland of his being appointed mini&s;ter for the home-department, and to &s;alute him as his colleague. They &s;tayed a few minutes; and an hour of the following
<PB N="78" REF="034483_0076_0FFDE8F4AD999580">

'The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> goes a man,' &s;aid I when they went away, &s;peaking of Dumouriez, whom I had never &s;een before; 'there go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a man of a &s;ubtle mind, and a deceitful look; again&s;t whom perhaps it will behove you to be more upon your guard than again&s;t any man whatever: he expre&s;&s;ed great plea&s;ure at the patriotic choice he was employed to announce, and yet I &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed if on &s;ome future day he bring about your di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.'&mdash;Dumouriez, indeed, at the fir&s;t glance, appeared to me &s;o widely different from Roland, that I could not &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;i|ble for them to act long in concert. On one &s;ide I beheld integrity and frankne&s;s per&s;onified, with rigid ju&s;tice devoid of all courtly arts, and of all the dexterous manoeuvres of a man of the world: on the other I fan|cied I could recognize a libertine of great parts, a deter|mined adventurer, inclined to make a je&s;t of every thing, except his own intere&s;t and fame. It was not difficult to infer, that &s;uch elements would act repul&s;ively upon each other.</P>
<P>ROLAND's incredible indu&s;try, his readine&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s, and his methodical turn, &s;oon enabled him, when mi|ni&s;ter, to make an arrangement in his head of all the various branches of his department. But the principles and habits of the chief clerks rendered his employment extremely laborious. He was obliged to be on his guard, and to contend mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly to prevent any thing con|tradictory from taking place in his official proceedings; he was engaged in &s;hort in one continued &s;truggle with his agents. He &s;trongly felt the nece&s;&s;ity of changing them; but he was too prudent to do &s;o, before he had become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|miliar with affairs, and &s;ecured proper per&s;ons to &s;upply th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

places. As to the council, its &s;ittings rather re&s;embled the chit-chat of a private party, than the deliberations of &s;tate&s;men. Each mini&s;ter brought with him ordinances and proclamations to be &s;igned; and the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice pre&s;ented decrees to be &s;anctioned. The king read the gazette: que&s;tioned each of them about his private affairs, thus te&s;tifying with no &s;mall &s;hare of addre&s;s that &s;ort of kind concern, of which the great knew how to make a merit; talked like a plain man about affairs in general; and at every turn profe&s;&s;ed, with an air of frankne&s;s, his de&s;ire to put the con&s;titu|tion in force. For the fir&s;t three weeks, Roland and Claviere appeared almo&s;t enchanted with the king's ex|cellent di&s;po&s;ition of mind, giving him credit on his bare word, and rejoicing, like hone&s;t men, at the turn that things were about to take. 'Good God!' &s;aid I, 'when I &s;ee you &s;et out for the council with all that delightful confidence, it always &s;eems to me that you are on the point of committing &s;ome egregious act of folly.'&mdash;I never could bring my&s;elf to believe in the con&s;titutional vocation of a king born and brought up in de&s;poti&s;m, and accu&s;tomed to exerci&s;e arbitrary &s;way. Lewis XVI mu&s;t have been a man above the common race of mortals, had he been &s;incerely the friend of a con&s;titution that re&s;trained his power; and if &s;uch a man, he would never have &s;uffered tho&s;e events to occur which brought about the revolution.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t time Roland appeared at court, the plainne&s;s of his apparel, his round hat, and his &s;hoes tied with ribbands, were matters of a&s;toni&s;hment and offence to all the court valets; to tho&s;e beings, who, deriving their &s;ole con&s;equence from etiquette, believed that the &s;afety

The ma&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the ceremonies, &s;tepping up to Dumouriez with alarm in his countenance, and a contracted brow, pointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Roland by a glance of the eye: Oh dear!

<P>A COUNCIL being held four times a week, the mini&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> agreed to dine on tho&s;e days at one another's hou&s;es by turns; and every Friday I received them as my gue&s;ts. <HI>Degrave</HI> was then mini&s;ter of war. He was a little man, in every &s;en&s;e of the word: nature had made him gentle and timid; his prejudices prompted him to be haughty, while his heart in&s;pired him with the de&s;ire of being ami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ble; and in his perplexity to reconcile the&s;e jarring af+fections, he became nothing at all. I think I &s;ee him now, walking on his heels like a courtier, with his head erect on his &s;lender body; turning up his blue eyes, which he could not keep open after dinner without the help of two or three cups of coffee: &s;peaking little, as if out of re&s;erve, but in reality for want of ideas; and at length &s;o bewildered in the labyrinth of his official bu&s;ine&s;s, as to a&s;k leave to retire. <HI>Laco&s;te,</HI> a true jack in office of the old order of things, of which he had the in&s;ignificant and awkward look, cold manner, and dog|matic tone, wanted none of tho&s;e advantages which a man hackneyed in the routine of public bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eldom fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to acquire; but his apparent re&s;erve and di&s;cretion concealed a violence of temper, which he carried wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contradicted to the mo&s;t ridiculous exce&s;s.

for from Bourdeaux to be made mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, was an hone&s;t man, according to common report; but he was very indolent; his manner indicated vanity; and his timid di&s;po&s;ition, and pompous prattle, made him always appear to me no better than an old woman. <HI>Clavi&eacute;re,</HI> who&s;e coming into office was preceded by a reputation of great &s;kill in finance, was, I make no doubt, well in|formed upon that &s;ubject, of which I am no judge. Ac|tive, indu&s;trious, of an irritable di&s;po&s;ition, ob&s;tinate, as mo&s;t men are who live much in the retirement of the clo&s;et, and cavilling and uncomplying in debate, he could not do otherwi&s;e than cla&s;h with Roland, who was dry and peremptory in di&s;pute, and not le&s;s &s;tiff in opinion than him&s;elf. The&s;e two men were made to e&s;teem, without loving each other; and they have not belied their de&s;tiny. <HI>Dumouriez</HI> had more of what is called parts than all of them put together, and le&s;s <HI>morality</HI> than any one of the number. Diligent, brave, an able general, an artful courtier, writing well, &s;peaking fluent|ly, and capable of great undertakings, he wanted nothing but &s;trength of mind proportioned to his genius, and a cooler head to execute the plans he had conceived. Agreeable in his commerce with his friends, and ready to deceive them all; attentive to women, but by no means calculated to &s;ucceed with tho&s;e, whom a tender pa&s;&s;ion might &s;educe; he was made for the mini&s;terial intrigues of a corrupt and faithle&s;s court. His brilliant qualities, and love of fame, gave room to hope, that he might be employed with advantage in the army of the republic; and perhaps he would have proceeded in the right path, if the convention had been prudent; for he is too wi&s;e

not to act like an hone&s;t man, when his doing &s;o is con|ducive to his intere&s;t and reputation.</P>
<P>DEGRAVE was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Servan,</HI> an hone&s;t man, in the fulle&s;t &s;ignification of the term, of an ardent tem|per and excellent moral character, with all the au&s;terity of a philo&s;opher, and all the benevolence of a feeling heart; an enlightened patriot, a brave &s;oldier, an an active mini&s;ter, he &s;tood in need of nothing, but a more &s;ober imagination, and a more flexible mind.</P>
<P>THE troubles on the &s;core of religion, and the prepara|tions of the enemy, calling for deci&s;ive decrees, the refu&s;al of &s;anctioning them completely tore away the veil from Louis XVI, who&s;e &s;incerity was already &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected by &s;uch of his mini&s;ters as had before been inclined to be|lieve it real. At fir&s;t the refu&s;al was not po&s;itive: the king being de&s;irous of con&s;idering the &s;ubject, put off the &s;anc|tion till the following council, when he always found rea|&s;ons for deferring it &s;till longer. This procra&s;tination gave his mini&s;ters an opportunity of &s;peaking out. Roland and Servan, in particular, remon&s;trated ince&s;&s;antly, and &s;poke the mo&s;t &s;triking truths with becoming &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THEIR &s;ituation became critical: the public weal was in danger: and it was incumbent on mini&s;ters truly patriotic, either to provide the means of its &s;alvation, or to retire, that they might not be a&s;&s;i&s;ting in its ruin. Roland propo&s;ed to his colleagues a letter to the king purporting as much; but Claviere cavilled at the ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and Duranthon, who was fond of his place, was unwilling to ri&s;k the lo&s;s of it, if he could po&s;&s;ibly keep it, without being a confe&s;t traitor. Laco&s;te did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="83" REF="034483_0081_0FFDE903409DF580">
approve of &s;trong mea&s;ures, and the will of the king appeared to him, upon the whole, the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible rules; while Dumouriez left them to &s;ettle the matter among them&s;elves, that he might be more at lei&s;ure to play his own cards, and to revenge what he con&s;idered as a vexatious affront. The fact was as follows.</P>
<P>THAT kind of rumour, which does not as yet amount to the opinion of the public, but which foreruns and an|nounces it, was afloat again&s;t Bonnecarrere, whom Du|mouriez had made director-general of the department of foreign affairs. He had the reputation, the talents, the di&s;po&s;ition and the manners of an intriguer: &s;o at lea&s;t I have been told by men of probity, who related various circum&s;tances of his life, and lamented the choice that Dumouriez had made.</P>
<P>A REPORT was &s;pread of &s;ome place being be&s;towed or affair &s;ettled, by Bonnecarrere, on his receiving a con&s;ider|ation of a hundred thou&s;and livres [&pound;4167] part of which was to be given to madame de Beauvert. That lady was Dumouriez's mi&s;tre&s;s, and lived in his hou&s;e, where &s;he did the honours of the table, to the great di&s;plea&s;ure of men of &s;en&s;e, the friends of morality and freedom; for &s;uch licentiou&s;ne&s;s in a &s;ervant of the public, charged with the conduct of affairs of &s;tate, too plainly indicated a contempt of decorum; e&s;pecially as madame Beauvert, the &s;i&s;ter of Riverol, a man unfortunately but too well known, lived in the mid&s;t of the &s;worn friends of ari&s;tocracy, people little entitled to commendation in any point of view. Dumou|riez's conduct, even if it had not been fundamentally wrong, was impolitic, and calculated to excite &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>I WAS frequently vi&s;ited by Bri&s;&s;ot, and &s;everal other
<PB N="84" REF="034483_0082_0FFDE904CE7700C0">
members of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly. They &s;ometimes m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mini&s;ters at my hou&s;e; and kept up that kind of inti|macy with them, which is requi&s;ite among men who, being devoted alike to the cau&s;e of the public, &s;tand in need of an intercommunity of views and information, in order to &s;erve it the more effectually. The &s;tory of Bonnecarrere was related to one of them; and the parties were mentioned by name, as well as the notary in who&s;e hands the money was depo&s;ited, or who was at lea&s;t appointed to receive it; but the&s;e particulars have e&s;caped my memory. I only recol|lect, that two men of character came to my hou&s;e and affirm|ed them in the pre&s;ence of three or four members of the legi&s;lative body, one of whom, a friend of Dumouriez, was de&s;irous of hearing the whole &s;tory from their mouths. It was re&s;olved to repeat to Dumouriez, with a degree of &s;o|lemnity, the arguments that had already been urged to him in private, concerning the nece&s;&s;ity both on the public ac|count and his own, of making his conduct, and the choice of his agents, more conformable to the political principles which he pretended to entertain. The conver&s;ation con&s;equently took place in the pre&s;ence of his colleagues and of three or four members of the a&s;&s;embly. Roland, availing him&s;elf of the authority given him by his years and character, pointed out to Dumouriez the nece&s;&s;ity of his con|ducting him&s;elf with more propriety and prudence, and every one agreed, that this la&s;t trait of Bonnecarrere ought to open his eyes, and induce him to put &s;ome other per&s;on in his place. Dumouriez, who turned Bonnecarrere's talents to good account, and gave him&s;elf little concern on the &s;core of morality, treated the ob&s;ervations of his friends with great levity, and at length rejected them with
<PB N="85" REF="034483_0083_0FFDE907764301A8">
anger. From that moment he di&s;continued all inter|cour&s;e with the members, behaved with greater coolne&s;s to his colleagues, and, without doubt, no longer thought of any thing, but overturning tho&s;e by who&s;e gravity he was the mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ed. I fore&s;aw the effect of this conference, and &s;aid to Roland: 'if you were an in|triguer, and capable of conducting your&s;elf according to the policy of the old court and government, I &s;hould tell you, that the moment to ruin Dumouriez is at hand, if you wi&s;h to prevent his playing you a trick.' But hone&s;t men under&s;tand not this petty warfare; and Roland was as incapable of having recour&s;e to it, as he would have been ill-fitted to carry it on.</P>
<P>THE po&s;tponement of the &s;anction was nearly become a refu&s;al; the utmo&s;t limit of delay was at hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the con&s;titution of 1789, the king was allowed to withhold his &s;anction during a certain number of months, at the end of which his ne|glecting to give his con&s;ent amounted to a refu&s;al. <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>. We were &s;en&s;ible, as the council was neither &s;ufficiently unani|mous nor energetic to &s;peak out in a collective &s;hape, that it became the integrity and courage of Roland to &s;tep for|ward alone; and between us two we determined on his famous letter to the king. He carried it with him to the council, with the intention of reading it aloud, the very day when Louis XVI, on being pre&s;&s;ed anew for his &s;anc|tion, required each of his mini&s;ters to give him his opinion written and &s;igned, and proceeded rapidly to di&s;cu&s;s other affairs. Roland returned home, added a few introductory lines to his letter, and delivered the whole into the king's hands, on the morning of the 11th of June.</P>
<P>THE next day, the 12th, at eight in the evening, Servan walked into my room with a &s;miling countenance, 'give
<PB N="86" REF="034483_0084_0FFDE90A217E5B28">
me joy', &s;aid he, 'I have ju&s;t had the honour of being turned away.'&mdash;'That is an honour,' an&s;wered I, 'that my hu&s;band will &s;oon &s;hare; and I am not a little mortifi|ed that you &s;hould get the &s;tart of us.' He then related to me, that, having been with the king in the morning on particular bu&s;ine&s;s, he had &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the camp of twenty thou&s;and men, if it were &s;in|cerely his attention to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of the enemy; that the king had turned his back upon him in very ill-humour; and that Dumouriez, at the very &s;ame in&s;tant, was com|ing out of the war office, whither he had been to take his portfolio from him, by virtue of an order, of which he was the bearer.&mdash;'Who? Dumouriez? He is acting a vile part; but I am not at all &s;urpri&s;ed at it.'&mdash;The three preceding days Dumouriez had been frequently at the Tuileries, and had held long conferrences with the queen; with whom, it may not be impertinent to remark, that Bonnecarrere had &s;ome intere&s;t, by means of her women. Roland, be|ing informed that Servan was in my apartment, quitted the per&s;ons to whom he was giving audience, and on hear|ing the news, reque&s;ted his colleagues, Dumouriez excep|ted, to repair to the hotel.</P>
<P>IT was his opinion, that they ought not to wait for their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion: but that in con&s;equence of Servan's being de|clared, it became all tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame prin|ciples to give in their re&s;ignations; unle&s;s the king &s;hould recall Servan, and di&s;mi&s;s Dumouriez, with whom they could no longer &s;it at the council-table. Had the four mini&s;ters acted thus, the court, I have no doubt, would have been not a little embarra&s;&s;ed to replace them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would have done honour to Laco&s;te and Duranthon, and the affair would have had a more &s;triking effect upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="87" REF="034483_0085_0FFDE90DE59936B0">
public mind: but it was de&s;tined to have that effect after|wards in a different way.</P>
<P>THE mini&s;ters came and debated for a long-while, without coming to any re&s;olution, except that they would meet again the next morning at eight, and that Roland &s;hould prepare a letter in the mean time. I could never have believed, had not circum&s;tances put me in the way of knowing it, that &s;oundne&s;s of judgment, and a firm temper of mind, are things &s;o uncommon, and con&s;equently that &s;o few men are fit for the tran&s;|action of bu&s;ine&s;s, particularly that of the &s;tate. Would you wi&s;h to meet with the above qualities in con|junction with perfect di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s?&mdash;"That were in|deed the Arabian bird," &s;carcely &s;een once in a long &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of ages. I no longer wonder, that men &s;uperior to the herd, and placed at the head of empires, com|monly entertain a &s;overeign contempt for their &s;pecies: it is the almo&s;t inevitable con&s;equence of an exten&s;ive knowledge of the world; and to avoid the errors, into which &s;uch a &s;entiment may lead tho&s;e to whom the welfare of a nation is entru&s;ted, requires a fund of philo|&s;ophy and magnanimity very extraordinary indeed.</P>
<P>THE mini&s;ters came at the appointed hour; expre&s;&s;ed their doubts about the letter; and at length concluded; that it would be better to go to the king, and declare their &s;entiments in per&s;on. This expedient appeared to me no better than an eva&s;ion; for certain it is, that a man never &s;peaks &s;o boldly as he may venture to write, to a per&s;on, who, by virtue of his rank, and the force of cu&s;tom, lays claim to particular re&s;pect. It was agreed upon that they &s;hould take Laco&s;te, who had not yet made his appearance, along with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or at lea&s;t that they
<PB N="88" REF="034483_0086_0FFDE90F72C83E80">
&s;hould invite him to be one of the party. But &s;carcely had the&s;e gentlemen a&s;&s;embled at the admiralty-office, when a me&s;&s;enger from the king brought Duranthon an order to repair to the palace immediately and alone. Clavi&egrave;re and Roland told him, that they would go and wait for his re|turn at the chancery. They had not been there long before Duranthon made his appearance in &s;olemn &s;ilence, with a long face, and a hypocritical appearance of &s;orrow, taking &s;lowly out of his pocket an order from the king for each of the other two.&mdash;'Give it me,' &s;aid Roland, with a &s;mile: 'I perceive already that our delays have made us lo&s;e the &s;tart.'&mdash;In fact he brought their di&s;mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>'WELL! I am turned out too,' &s;aid my hu&s;band on his return.&mdash;'I hope,' an&s;wered I, 'that it is better de&s;erving on your part, than on that of any one el&s;e; but you &s;hould not by any means allow the king to announce it to the a&s;|&s;embly; &s;ince he has not profited by the le&s;&s;on given him in your letter, you ought to render that le&s;&s;on u&s;eful to the public, by making it known. Nothing appears to me more con&s;i&s;tent with the courage evinced by writing it, than the hardihood of &s;ending a copy to the a&s;&s;embly: on hearing of your di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, it will al&s;o be acquainted with the cau&s;e.'</P>
<P>THIS idea could not fail to be agreeable to my hu&s;|band. It was adopted; and every body knows the ap|probation which the a&s;&s;embly gave to the letter, by or|dering it to be printed and &s;ent to the departments, as well as the honour they did to the three mini&s;ters, by declaring that the regret of the nation attended them in their re|treat. In my own mind I am convinced, and I think the event has proved it, that Roland's letter contributed greatly to enlighten the French nation; it exhibited to the king, with &s;o much force and wi&s;dom, what his o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="89" REF="034483_0087_0FFDC5968043CB78">
intere&s;t required of him, that it was ea&s;y to perceive he refu&s;ed his compliance, out of a determined oppo&s;ition to the maintenance of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>WHEN I recollect, that Pache was in Roland's clo&s;et while we were reading the rough draught of that letter, and that he deemed it an adventurous &s;tep; when I re|flect how often that man has witne&s;&s;ed our enthu&s;ia&s;m in the cau&s;e of liberty, and our zeal to &s;erve it; and &s;ee him now at the head of that arbitrary authority, which oppre&s;&s;es and per&s;ecutes us as enemies of the republic: I a&s;k my&s;elf, whether I be awake, and whether the dream mu&s;t not ter|minate in the puni&s;hment of that infamous hypocrite.</P>
<P>THUS did we return to private life. Perhaps I may be a&s;ked, whether I never knew any further particulars con|cerning the manner, in which Roland was called into ad|mini&s;tration. I can &s;afely &s;ay, I never did; and that I never even thought of enquiring about it: for it appeared to me to be brought about like many other things in this world; the idea occurs to &s;ome one per&s;on, many ap|prove it, and with this &s;upport it attracts the notice of people capable of carrying it into effect. I perceived, that the bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion had &s;truck &s;ome of the members; but I know not who it was that fir&s;t propo&s;ed it; nor by whom it was tran&s;mitted to the court. Roland knew no more of it, and gave him&s;elf no more concern about it, than I. When a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Degrave was thought of for the war department, the mini&s;ters and patriotic mem|bers did not know whither to direct their views, almo&s;t all the officers of the army of any repute, being looked upon as enemies to the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;titution. Roland at la&s;t thought of Servan, a military man, who had earned the cro&s;s of St.

We were per&s;onally acquainted with him, in con&s;equence of &s;eeing him at Lyons, where he enjoyed the well-earnt reputation of an active and &s;agacious man: he had be&s;ides, in the year 1790, lo&s;t a place at court, where his civi&s;m was not agreeable to Mon&s;ieur Guynard-St.-Prie&s;t. The&s;e con&s;iderations induced the members of the council to join in propo&s;ing him to the king, by whom he was accepted.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my hu&s;band was in the mini&s;try, I came to a fixed determination, neither to pay nor receive vi&s;its, nor invite any female to my table. I had no great &s;acri|fices to make on that head: for, not re&s;iding con&s;tantly at Paris, my acquaintance was not exten&s;ive; be&s;ides, I had no where kept a great deal of company, becau&s;e my love of &s;tudy is as great as my dete&s;tation of cards, and becau&s;e the &s;ociety of &s;illy people affords me no diver|&s;ion. Accu&s;tomed to &s;pend my days in dome&s;tic retire|ment, I &s;hared the labours of Roland, and pur&s;ued the &s;tudies mo&s;t &s;uited to my own particular ta&s;te. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;o &s;evere a rule &s;erved then at once to keep up my accu&s;tomed &s;tyle of life, and to prevent the inconveniences which an intere&s;ted crowd throws in the way of people occupying important po&s;ts. Properly &s;peaking, I never received company in my hotel: twice a week, indeed, I gave a dinner to &s;ome of the mini&s;ters, a few members of the a&s;&s;embly, and the per&s;ons with whom my hu&s;band had any thing to talk over, or which acquaintance he wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve. Bu&s;ine&s;s was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

of in my pre&s;ence; becau&s;e I had not the rage of inter|ferring, and was not &s;urrounded with &s;uch company as could excite di&s;tru&s;t. Out of all the rooms of a &s;pacious apartment, I had cho&s;en, for my daily habitation, the &s;malle&s;t parlour, which I had converted into a &s;tudy, by removing into it my books and a bureau. It often hap|pened, that Roland's friends or colleagues, when they wanted to &s;peak to him confidentially, in&s;tead of going to his apartment, where he was &s;urrounded by his clerks or by the public, would come to mine, and reque&s;t me to &s;end for him. By the&s;e means I found my&s;elf drawn into the vortex of public affairs, without intrigue or idle cu|rio&s;ity. Roland had a plea&s;ure in afterwards conver&s;|ing with me about them in private, with that confidence which we ever placed in each other, and which e&s;tabli&s;hed between us an intercommunity of knowledge and opinions; and it &s;ometimes happened al&s;o, that friends, who had only &s;ome information to give, or a few words to &s;ay, being always &s;ure of finding me, came and reque&s;ted I would make the nece&s;&s;ary communication to Roland as &s;oon as an opportunity might occur.</P>
<P>IT had been found nece&s;&s;ary to counterbalance the influence of the court, the ari&s;tocracy, the civil li&s;t, and the mini&s;terial papers, by information given to the people in the mo&s;t public way. A daily paper, po&s;ted up in the &s;treets, &s;eemed well calculated for that purpo&s;e; but it was nece&s;&s;ary to find a judicious and enlightened man, capable of following up events, and exhibiting them in their proper colours, to be the conducter. <HI>Louv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ready known as an author, a man of letters, and a po|litician, was pointed out, approved of, and undertook the ta&s;k.

Petion him|&s;elf was allowed none for the police; and yet in a town like Paris, and in &s;uch a &s;tate of things, when it was of importance to have people in pay, in order to gain timely information of every thing that happened, or that might be in agitation, it was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. To ob|tain any thing from the a&s;&s;embly, would have been difficult; for the demand would infallibly have given the alarm to the parti&s;ans of the court, and would have met with many ob&s;tacles. At la&s;t it occurred, that Dumou|riez, who had &s;ecret &s;ervice-money for the department of foreign affairs, might allow a certain &s;um monthly to the mayor of Paris for the police; and that out of that &s;um might be taken the expences of the daily paper which was to be po&s;ted up, and which the mini&s;ter of the home-de|partment was to &s;uperintend. The expedient was &s;imple, and was adopted. Such was the origin of the <HI>Sentinel.</HI></P>
<P>IT was in the cour&s;e of the month of July, that per|ceiving affairs daily growing wor&s;e through the perfidy of the court, the march of the foreign troops, and the weakne&s;s of the a&s;&s;embly, we looked out for a place where liberty, threatened from &s;o many quarters, might find an a&s;ylum. We frequently conver&s;ed with Barba|roux and Servan concerning the excellent &s;pirit that pre|vailed in the South, the energy of the departments in that quarter of France, and the advantages its &s;ituation afforded for founding a republic, if the triumphant court &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> means to &s;ubjugate Paris and the North.

<P>WE under&s;tood very well, without his explaining him|&s;elf farther, that an in&s;urrection was projected.

<P>IT is true, at the period of a revolution, there will always be found, particularly among a corrupt peo|ple, and in large cities, a cla&s;s of men de&s;titute of the advantages of fortune, covetous of her favours, and in|clined to make any &s;acrifice to obtain them, or el&s;e ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;upply the want of them by illicit means.

<P>THE patriotic &s;ocieties, tho&s;e collections of men a&s;&s;embled to deliberate on their rights and intere&s;ts, have exhibited to us a picture in miniature of what pa&s;&s;es in the great &s;oci|ety of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>FIRST we find a few men of ardent di&s;po&s;itions, deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the public danger, and &s;eeking &s;incerely to prevent it. The&s;e men the philo&s;ophers join becau&s;e they conceive &s;uch a junction nece&s;&s;ary to overturn tyranny, and propagate principles beneficial to mankind. Accordingly, great principles are developed, and di&s;&s;eminated; generous &s;entiments are called forth and diffu&s;ed; and a vigorous impul&s;ion is given both to the hearts and minds of men. Then come forward indivi|duals, who, by a&s;&s;uming principles that do not belong to them, which they decorate with the mo&s;t captivating language, endeavour to gain the favour of the public, in order to acquire con&s;equence or power. They pa&s;s the bounds of truth, to render them&s;elves more remark|able; heat the imagination by fal&s;e and exaggerated re+pre&s;entations; flatter the pa&s;&s;ions of the populace, ever di&s;po&s;ed to admire the gigantic; urge it on to mea&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in which they have the means of making them&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;eful, in order to be thought nece&s;&s;ary upon all oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;ions;

and employ them&s;elves in the foul work of throw|ing &s;u&s;picion upon tho&s;e prudent or enlightened men, of who&s;e merit they are afraid, and with whom they are not able to &s;tand in competition. Calumny, at fir&s;t employed without art, learns, from the humiliation it receives, to &s;hape it&s;elf into a &s;y&s;tem; and at length becomes a pro|found &s;cience, in which they and their fellows alone can &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>UNQUESTIONABLY many people of this character joined the popular party again&s;t the court; ready to &s;erve the latter for money, and as ready to betray it, in ca&s;e it &s;hould become the weaker party. The court affected to believe that all tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed its de&s;igns were of the above de&s;cription, and was fond of confounding them under the appellation of the factious. The real patriots &s;uffered this noi&s;y pack to go their own way, like &s;o many hounds; and perhaps were not &s;orry to make them &s;erve as a for|lorn hope, to receive the fir&s;t fire of the enemy. In their hatred of de&s;poti&s;m they did not recollect, that, if it be allowable in politics, to &s;uffer good things to be effected by bad men, or to profit by their exce&s;&s;es for &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e, it is infinitely dangerous to a&s;cribe to them the honour of the one, or not to puni&s;h them for the other.</P>
<P>EVERY body is acquainted with the revolution of the 10th of Augu&s;t, of which I know no more than is known to the public; for, though well informed of the great outline of affairs while Roland was a &s;ervant of the pub|lic, and attending to it with intere&s;t when he was no lon|ger in place, I never was a confident of what may be called the manoeuvring of parties; nor was he him&s;elf ever concerned in that &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

But who was to make the&s;e re|flections? who could have dared to announce and openly maintain them?

<P>DANTON &s;carcely &s;uffered a day to pa&s;s without coming to our hou&s;e. Sometimes it was in his way to the council; he would arrive a little before the hour, and &s;tep into my apartment; or el&s;e he would call in his return, mo&s;t commonly accompanied by Fabre-d'Englantine: at other times, he would invite him&s;elf to dine with me, on days when I was not accu&s;tomed to &s;ee company, in order that he might conver&s;e with Roland about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>NO man could make a &s;how of greater zeal, of a greater love of liberty, or of a greater de&s;ire to concur with his colleagues in &s;erving it effectually.

In this manner my imagination has often figured Danton, with a dagger in his hand, encouraging by his voice and his example a band of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, more timid or le&s;s ferocious than him&s;elf: or el&s;e, when &s;atiated with his crimes, in|dicating his habits and propen&s;ities by the ge&s;tures of a Sardanapalus.

He &s;howed, that the intention of the a&s;&s;embly had been, to give the executive power, at this critical period, all the nece&s;&s;ary means of acting with promptitude; that it was the council collectively that had a right to decide on the employment of the monies, on the demand being made, and the purpo&s;es &s;pecified, by the head of each department; and he declared, moreover, that, for his own part, I

Danton quickly drew a hundred thou&s;and crowns, [&pound;. 20,833] out of the public trea&s;ury, and di&s;po&s;ed of them as he thought proper: which did not prevent his getting 60,000l.

<P>THIS is the way in which Servan related the &s;tory to me. The council, on being de&s;ired by the a&s;&s;embly to &s;ay, whether Danton had given them any account, an|&s;wered &s;imply <HI>yes.</HI> But Danton had acquired &s;o much

<P>AFTER this no one will be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear that Dan|ton, wanting to &s;end one of his creatures into Britanny, under pretence of vi&s;iting the &s;ea-ports and examining the in&s;pectors, prevailed on the mini&s;ter of the marine to give him a commi&s;&s;ion. But commi&s;&s;ions of this kind required the &s;ignature of all the members of the council, and Roland refu&s;ed his. 'Either,' &s;aid he to Monge, 'your agents do their duty, or they do not; and of this you are competent to judge. If they do not, di&s;mi&s;s them without mercy; if they do, why damp their zeal and in&s;ult them, by &s;ending a &s;tranger among them, who has no connexion with your department, and would only prove your di&s;tru&s;t. Such a proceeding by no means becomes the character of a mini&s;ter: nor will I &s;ign the commi&s;&s;ion.' The &s;itting of the council was unu&s;ually protracted, and towards the end of it the pa|pers to be &s;igned pre&s;ented them&s;elves in rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="105" REF="034483_0103_0FFDE93B69973398">
Roland perceiving, that he had ju&s;t put his name, after tho&s;e of all his colleagues, to the rejected commi&s;&s;ion, which had been &s;lipt into his hand, cancelled it, and upbraided Monge. 'It is Danton who will have it &s;o,' an&s;wered Monge in a whi&s;per, and with fear pictured in his countenance: if I refu&s;e, he will denounce me to the commune, and to the cordeliers, and get me hanged.'&mdash; 'Well! in my mind, a mini&s;ter ought to die, rather than give way to &s;uch con&s;iderations.'</P>
<P>THE bearer of this commi&s;&s;ion was arre&s;ted in Brit|tany, by order of an admini&s;tration which took offence at his conduct, and to which the cancelled &s;ignature of Roland appeared a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to enter into a clo&s;e examination of his conduct. Heavy charges were pre|ferred again&s;t him; but it was at the end of the year, when the cau&s;e of all anarchi&s;ts was e&s;pou&s;ed by the mountain, which obtained a decree, directing that Guermeur &s;hould be &s;et at large.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;uffered my&s;elf to be hurried away by circum|&s;tances; let me now re&s;ume the chain of facts.</P>
<P>DANTON and Fabre cea&s;ed to vi&s;it me towards the latter end of Augu&s;t. No doubt they were cautious of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to attentive eyes, while chanting the matins of September; and were well aware of the na|ture of Roland and the people he had about him. His firm temper of mind, his upright and ingenuous di&s;po&s;i|tion, the &s;trictne&s;s of his principles, di&s;played without o&s;tentation, and yet without con&s;traint, and the uniform tenor of his conduct, are &s;ure to &s;trike every eye at the fir&s;t glance. They concluded, that Roland was an ho|ne&s;t man, who was not to be tampered with in under|takings like their's: that his wife had no weak &s;ide,

through which he might be a&s;&s;ailed; and that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith an equal &s;hare of principle, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that penetration peculiar to her &s;ex, again&s;t which d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itful people have the mo&s;t rea&s;on to be upon their g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Per|haps too they judged, that &s;he could &s;ometimes wield a pen; and that &s;uch a couple, en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owed as they were with the faculty of rea&s;oning, a firm temper of mind, and &s;ome portion of talents, might &s;tand in the way of their de&s;igns, and were &s;it only to be ruined. The events that en&s;ued, illu&s;trated by a number of circum&s;tances, which it would be difficult for me to detail at pre&s;ent, but of which a lively impre&s;&s;ion remains upon my mind, give to the&s;e conjectures all the evidence of demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>IT had been deemed expedient, as one of the fir&s;t mea|&s;ures to be taken by the council, to di&s;patch commi&s;&s;ioners to the departments, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of explaining the events of the 10th of Augu&s;t, and &s;till more for that of inducing the people to prepare for defence, and to be expe|ditious in rai&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary recruits for the armies oppo|&s;ed to the enemy upon the frontier of France. As &s;oon as the &s;election of proper per&s;ons, and the &s;ending them upon their mi&s;&s;ion began to be agitated, Roland de&s;ired a day's delay to con&s;ider whom he &s;hould propo&s;e.&mdash;I will take it all upon my&s;elf,' exclaimed Danton: 'the commune of Paris will furni&s;h us with excellent patriots.'&mdash;The indolen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> majority of the council accordingly intru&s;ted him with the care of pointing them out: and the next day he came to the council with commi&s;&s;ions ready made out, &s;o that no|thing more was nece&s;&s;ary than to fill them up with the names he recommended, and to affix the nece&s;&s;ary &s;igna|tures. The council made little inquiry about them, and
<PB N="107" REF="034483_0105_0FFDE93E984D7F20">
&s;igned the commi&s;&s;ions without going into any debate. Thus did a &s;warm of men &s;carcely known; intriguers of &s;ections, or bawlers at clubs; patriots from fanatici&s;m, and &s;till more from views of intere&s;t; people de&s;titute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the mo&s;t part of all kind of con&s;equence, except what they had a&s;&s;umed, or hoped to acquire, in public commotions; but entirely devoted to Danton their protector, and ena|moured of his manners and licentious doctrines; thus did the&s;e men, I &s;ay, become the repre&s;entatives of the exe|cutive council in every department of France.</P>
<P>THIS bu&s;ine&s;s always appeared to me a great &s;troke of policy on the part of Danton, and a mo&s;t egregious blun|der on that of the council.</P>
<P>A MAN mu&s;t figure to him&s;elf the perplexity of each mini&s;ter in the mid&s;t of affairs of his own department, in tho&s;e turbulent times, to be able to conceive that upright and able men could act with &s;o much incon&s;ideration. The fact is, that the mini&s;ters of the home department, of war, and even of the marine, were overwhelmed with an exce&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s, and that official details &s;o com|pletely engro&s;&s;ed their thoughts as to allow them no time to reflect on the general &s;y&s;tem of politics. The coun|cil ought to be compo&s;ed of men employed &s;olely in de|liberating, and freed from all the cares of admini&s;tration. Danton was in the department that gives the lea&s;t trouble; and cared little about fulfilling the duties of his place: he gave his <HI>griffe</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An iron &s;tamp u&s;ed in France by people in office to repeat their &s;ignature with greater di&s;patch. <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE> to his clerks, who turned the wheel, and the machine went on its own way with|out his taking any concern in the matter. All his
<PB N="108" REF="034483_0106_0FFDE9437B0DD410">
time and attention were dedicated to intrigues, and &s;chemes, tending to promote his views of aggrandizement, fortune, and power. Continually haunting the offices of the war department, he procured appointments in the army for people of his own de&s;cription; and found means to give them an intere&s;t in the contracts and purcha&s;es made on the public account. In &s;hort, he neglected no line in which it was po&s;&s;ible to promote the&s;e men, the dregs of a corrupted nation, of which they become the &s;cum in political fermentations, and over which they domineer for a &s;hort &s;pace of time: with the&s;e he augmented his credit, and compo&s;ed a faction, that &s;oon became powerful, and are now lords paramount of all.</P>
<P>THE enemy advanced, and made an alarming progre&s;s on our territory. Men, who de&s;ire to govern the multitude, and who have &s;tudied the various means of working upon their minds, know terror to be one of the mo&s;t powerful. This affection ab&s;olutely &s;ubjects tho&s;e who experience it, to the men who allow it to hold no dominion over their minds; how much greater &s;till are the advantages of tho&s;e, who purpo&s;ely in&s;pire it by fal&s;e rumours or pretences! That calculation had certainly been made by the in&s;tigators of the ma&s;&s;acres of September; they mu&s;t have had the two-fold object of producing a tumult, under cover of which, the violation of the pri&s;ons and the murder of the pri&s;oners, would afford them an opportunity of gratifying their private animo&s;ities, of executing &s;chemes of plunder, the produce of which held out a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect to their avarice: and at the &s;ame time of diffu&s;ing that kind of &s;tupor, during which a &s;mall number of bold and ambitious men might lay the foun|dations
<PB N="109" REF="034483_0107_0FFDE9450A781D60">
of their power. Inferior agents were ea&s;ily brought over by the lure of profit: the pretence of immolating &s;uppo&s;ed traitors, from whom con&s;piracies were to be feared, could not fail to delude men of weak under&s;tand|ings, deceive the people, and &s;erve to ju&s;tify an action from which its directors would derive the blind obedience of their well paid &s;atellites, the attachment of all who &s;hared the profits with the leaders, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of an intimidated people, &s;urpri&s;ed at the energy, or per&s;ua|ded of the ju&s;tice of an operation, which the perpetrators would find means to make it abet, by repre&s;enting it as its own work. Accordingly whoever afterwards dared to re|probate tho&s;e crimes was proclaimed a <HI>calumniator</HI> of the city of Paris, pointed out as &s;uch to the fury of a certain cla&s;s of its inhabitants, and &s;tiled a <HI>federali&s;t,</HI> and a <HI>con|&s;pirator.</HI> Such was the crime of the <HI>twenty-two,</HI> joined to the unpardonable guilt of &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>A LOUD and alarming report of the taking of Verdun got ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oad on the fir&s;t of September. The orators ac|cu&s;tomed to harangue the groups collected in the &s;treets, &s;aid that the enemy was in full march to Ch&acirc;lons: ac|cording to them, three days more were &s;ufficient to bring them to Paris; and the people, who calculated nothing but the di&s;tance, without taking into the account the various things nece&s;&s;ary to the march of an army, for its &s;u&s;tenance, and the conveyance of its baggage and ar|tillery; every thing, in &s;hort, that renders its progre&s;s &s;o very different from that of an individual, already beheld the foreign troops triumphant amid the &s;moaking ruins of the capital.</P>
<P>NOTHING was neglected, that could inflame the imagi|nation, amplify objects, or augment the apprehen&s;ion of

danger; nor was it difficult to get the a&s;&s;embly to adopt mea&s;ures calculated to promote &s;uch de&s;igns. Domicili|ary vi&s;its, under the pretence of &s;earching for concealed arms, or di&s;cover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, &s;o frequent &s;ince the tenth of Augu&s;t, were re&s;olved upon as a general regu|lation, and made in the dead of night. They gave occa|&s;ion to fre&s;h and numerous captions, and to vexations un|heard of before. The commune of the tenth, compo&s;ed in great part of men, who, having nothing to lo&s;e, have every thing to gain by a revolution: the commune already guilty of a thou&s;and enormities, &s;tood in need of more: for it is by the accumulation of crimes, that impunity is &s;ecured. The misfortunes of the country were &s;olemnly announced. The &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, the black flag, was hoi&s;ted on the towers of the metropolitan church. The alarm-gun was fired. The commune proclaimed, by &s;ound of trumpet, a general a&s;&s;embly of the citizens, on Sun|day the &s;econd, in the Champ-de-Mars, in order to rally round the altar of the nation, tho&s;e zealous patriots who would immediately &s;et off for its defence. At the &s;ame time it directed the barriers to be &s;hut, and yet no one was &s;truck with the&s;e contradictory proceedings. There was a rumour of a plot hatching in the pri&s;ons by the ari&s;tocrats, (or the rich), of whom great numbers were confined; and of the unea&s;y and repugnant feelings of the people at quitting their homes, and leaving behind them tho&s;e rave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ous wolves, who were about to break their chains, and would fall with fury upon their dear and defencele&s;s relatives.</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of commotion, the mini&s;ter of the interior, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to watch over the general tranquillity, but who has neither the im|mediate exerci&s;e of power, nor a right to employ the
<PB N="111" REF="034483_0109_0FFDE94A856149F0">
public force, wrote in an urgent manner to the commune, through the medium of the mayor, pointing out the vigi|lance that it became them to di&s;play. Nor did he content him&s;elf with this &s;tep; but applied al&s;o to the com|mandant-general, exhorting him to &s;trengthen the po&s;ts, and keep an eye on the pri&s;ons. He did &s;till more; for hearing they were threatened, he called upon him in the mo&s;t formal manner, to keep a &s;trict guard over them, making his head re&s;pon&s;ible for events: and to give more efficacy to a requi&s;ition, to which his authority was confined, he had it printed and po&s;ted up at the corner of every &s;treet. That was hinting to the citizens at large, to be watchful them&s;elves, in ca&s;e the commandant &s;hould neglect his duty.</P>
<P>AT five in the evening of Sunday, nearly at the very moment when the pri&s;ons were inve&s;ted, as I have &s;ince been informed, about two hundred men repaired to the hotel of the home department, calling loudly for the mini|&s;ter, and for arms.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;itting in my own apartment, and as I thought I heard a noi&s;e, I ro&s;e, and perceiving the mob from the rooms that overlook the court, &s;tepped into the anti-chamber, and enquired what was the matter. Roland was gone out; but the per&s;ons who a&s;ked for him not being &s;atisfied with that information, in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;peaking with him at any rate. The &s;ervants refu&s;ed to let them come up, and told them over and over again the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e. Perceiving tho&s;e a&s;&s;urances ineffectual, I &s;ent out a dome&s;tic, to invite ten of them in my name to walk up &s;tairs; they came in, and I a&s;ked them calmly what they wanted. They told me, they were hone&s;t citizens, ready to &s;et off for Verdun, but being in great want of
<PB N="112" REF="034483_0110_0FFDE94D2FBA1038">
arms, they were come to a&s;k the mini&s;ter for a &s;upply, and were re&s;olved to &s;ee him. I ob&s;erved to them, that the mini&s;ter of the interior never had arms at his di&s;po&s;al; and that it was at the war-office, to the mini&s;ter of that depart|ment, they &s;hould addre&s;s their reque&s;t. They &s;aid in reply, that they had been there, and had been told there was no &s;uch thing; that all the mini&s;ters were ra&s;|cally traitors, and that they wanted Roland.&mdash;'I am &s;orry he is gone out, for his &s;olid arguments would have &s;ome weight with you: come along with me and &s;earch the hotel, and you will &s;oon be &s;atisfied that Roland is not at home, and that there are no arms here; nor indeed ought there to be any, as upon reflection you mu&s;t needs &s;uppo&s;e. Return to the war-office, or make your complaint to the commune: and if you wi&s;h Roland to &s;peak to you, re|pair to the hotel of the marine, where all the council is a&s;|&s;embled.'&mdash;On their withdrawing, I went into the balcony over the court, and thence beheld a furious fellow in his &s;hirt, with his &s;leeves tucked up to his &s;houlders, and a broad-&s;word in his hand, declaiming again&s;t the treachery of the mini&s;ters. The ten deputies di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves among the crowd, and at length prevailed on it to retreat by beat of drum; but they caraied the valet-de-cham|bre away with them as an ho&s;tage, made him follow them through the &s;treets for an hour, and then let him return.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after I got into a coach, and ha&s;tened to the admiralty, to inform my hu&s;band of what had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed. The council was not yet &s;itting; but I found a numerous circle, in which were &s;everal members of the a&s;&s;embly. The mini&s;ters at war and of ju&s;tice not being
<PB N="113" REF="034483_0111_0FFDE94FDB9D0010">
arrived, the others were conver&s;ing in the council cham|ber like a private party. I related my &s;tory, on which each made his remark, mo&s;t of them &s;uppo&s;ing it the fortuitous re&s;ult of circum&s;tances, and the efferve&s;cence of the public mind.</P>
<P>WHAT was Danton doing all that time?&mdash;I knew not till &s;everal days after; but it is worth while to mention it here, in order that facts may be compared. He was at the <HI>mairie</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The re&s;idence of the mayor.</NOTE>, in the committee of vigilance, as it was &s;tyled, whence i&s;&s;ued the orders of arre&s;t that were be|come &s;o numerous within the la&s;t few days. There a reconciliation had ju&s;t taken place between him and Marat, after they had made a parade of a feigned quarrel for four-and-twenty hours. He went up to P&eacute;tion's apartment, took him a&s;ide, and &s;aid to him, in his cu&s;|tomary language, interlarded with energetic expre&s;&s;ions: 'Can you gue&s;s what they have taken into their heads? Why, may I die, if they have not i&s;&s;ued a warrant again&s;t Roland?'&mdash;'Who do you mean?'&mdash;'Why, that mad-headed committee, to be &s;ure. I have the warrant in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: look, here it is. We can never &s;uffer them to go on at this rate. What, the devil! again&s;t a member of the council!'&mdash;P&eacute;tion took the warrant, read it, and returned it to him with a &s;mile: 'Let them pro|ceed,' &s;aid he: 'it will have a good effect.'&mdash;'A good effect!' replied Danton, examining the mayor's counte|nance with an earne&s;t eye. 'Oh! no, I can never &s;uffer it: I'll find means to make them li&s;ten to rea&s;on.'&mdash;And &s;o he did; for the warrant was never carried into execu|tion. But who &s;o blind, as not to &s;ee, that the two
<PB N="114" REF="034483_0112_0FFDE9528DBDFD78">
hundred men were &s;ent to the mini&s;ter of the home depart|ment by the devi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the warrant? Who &s;o dull, as not to &s;u&s;pect, that the failure of their attempt, by delay|ing the execution of the project, might give time to pau&s;e to tho&s;e by whom it was conceived? And who &s;o wanting in penetration as not to perceive, in Danton's conduct with the mayor, that of a con&s;pirator endeavouring to di&s;cover what effect &s;uch a blow would produce, or to a&s;cribe the honour of having parried it to him&s;elf when once it has failed, or been rendered dubious, by involuntary delay.</P>
<P>IT was pa&s;t eleven, when the mini&s;ters left the coun|cil; nor was it till the next morning that we learnt the horrors, of which the night had been witne&s;s, and which &s;till contiued to prevail in the pri&s;ons. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure at the&s;e abominable crimes, the inability of preventing them, and the evident participation of the commune and the commandant general<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grandpre, who by his office is bound to give an account of the &s;tate of the pri&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the mini&s;ter of the home department, had found their &s;ad inmates in the greate&s;t affright, in the morning of the 2d of September. He had taken various mea&s;ures to procure the liberation of many of them, and had &s;ucceeded with re&s;pect to a con&s;iderable number; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umours that prevailed kept tho&s;e who remained in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation. That worthy citizen, on his return to the hotel, waited for the mini&s;ters at the breaking up of the council. Danton fir&s;t made his appearance. He went up to him, told him what he had &s;een, related the &s;teps he had taken, the requi&s;itions made to the armed force by the mini&s;ter of the home department, the little regard apparently paid them, the alarms of the pri&s;oners, and the care which he, as mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, ought to take on their account. Dan+ton, vexed at this unlucky repre&s;entation, cried out in his bellowing voice, and appropriate ge&s;tures: 'I don't care a d&mdash;n for the pri&s;oners: let them take care of them&s;elves!' and walked away i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rage. That was in the &s;econd anti-chamber, in the pre&s;ence of twenty people, who &s;huddered at hearing &s;uch a &s;avage &s;peech from the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice. Danton enjoys the fruits of his crimes, after having attained &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the &s;everal degrees of influence; and per&s;ecuted and pro&s;cribed that probity, which declared war again&s;t him, and that merit, of which he dreaded the a&s;cendancy: Danton is become our ma&s;ter. His voice go|verns the a&s;&s;embly; his intrigues keep the people in motion; and his genius rules the committee, fal&s;ely denominated the committee of public &s;afety, in which all the power of the government re&s;ides. Thus di&s;order every where prevails, the men of blood bear &s;way; the mo&s;t rigid tyranny op|pre&s;&s;es the people of Paris; and France, torn to pieces and degraded, un|der &s;uch a ma&s;ter, can no longer change its oppre&s;&s;ors. I feel his hand rivet the fetters that bind me, as I perceived his in&s;piration in the fir&s;t at|tack made upon me by Marat.

<P>I remember to have read a little work &s;trongly ari|&s;tocratic, publi&s;hed &s;ince that aera at London, I believe by Pelltier: the author is greatly a&s;toni&s;hed, that the &s;ame per&s;on, who had been &s;o audaciou&s;ly wanting in re|&s;pect to his king, &s;hould afterwards di&s;play &s;o much ju&s;tice and humanity. Either the &s;pirit of party mu&s;t render a man extremely incon&s;i&s;tent, or virtue is &s;o &s;carce, that its very exi&s;tence is become que&s;tionable. The friend of freedom and his fellow-creatures holds in the &s;ame thorough dete&s;tation, and denounces with equal energy, the tyranny of a mob, and the tyranny of a king, the de&s;poti&s;m of a throne, and the di&s;orders of anarchy, the wiles of a court, and the ferocity of a lawle&s;s ban|ditti.</P>
<P>THAT &s;ame day, the 3d of September, a man, formerly a colleague of Roland, and to whom I had imagined I owed the civility of inviting him to dinner, took it into his head to bring with him the <HI>orator of the human race,</HI> without giving me any notice, or enquiring whether it would be agreeable. I con&s;idered his behaviour as attribu|table to the want of breeding of an hone&s;t man, impo&s;ed upon by the noi&s;y fame of the orator. I gave a polite re|ception to <HI>Clootz,</HI> of whom I knew nothing but his bom|ba&s;t orations, and of whom I had heard nothing el&s;e un|favourable; but one of my friends on &s;eeing him, whi&s;|pered in my ear, 'Your gue&s;t has introduced to you an in&s;ufferable para&s;ite, whom I am &s;orry to &s;ee here.'</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="034483_0115_0FFDE9AC5EDAE148">THE conver&s;ation turned on the events of the day. Clootz attempted to prove, that they were indi&s;pen&s;able and &s;alutary mea&s;ures; made many common-place ob|&s;ervations on the rights of the people, the ju&s;tice of their vengeance, and its &s;ub&s;erviency to the happine&s;s of man|kind; &s;poke loud, and long; ate &s;till more than he &s;poke; and tired more than one of his auditors. Being &s;oon after cho&s;en a member of the convention, he return|ed occa&s;ionally of his own accord; &s;eating him&s;elf in the fir&s;t place, and helping him&s;elf to the nice&s;t di&s;hes, without ceremony. My extreme and cold politene&s;s, accompanied with the care of always helping &s;everal per&s;ons before him, was calculated to make him &s;peedily perceive, that he had been "weighed in the &s;cale, and found wanting." He felt it, came no more, and revenged him&s;elf by calumnies. I &s;hould not have mentioned this contemptible fellow, but for the di&s;tingui&s;hed part he acted among&s;t the &s;landerers of better men, and the art which he contrived to make <HI>federali&s;m</HI> a &s;carecrow for fools, and to &s;et up as a title of pro&s;cription again&s;t men of under&s;tanding, who refu&s;ed to adopt his chimera of an univer&s;al commonwealth.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t time he came to vi&s;it me he mounted his hob|by-hor&s;e, and rehear&s;ed all his extravagancies concern|ing the po&s;&s;ibility of a convention formed of deputies from every corner of the world. Some of the company an&s;wered him with a je&s;t, while Roland, tired of the noi&s;e and pedantry, with which Clootz maintained his opinion, and attempted to make converts to it, had the goodne&s;s to a&s;&s;ail him with a &s;yllogi&s;m or two, and then turned away to another part of the room. The conver&s;a|tion cooled, and branched out into a variety of &s;ubjects.

Buzot, who&s;e &s;olid under&s;tanding never amu&s;es it&s;elf long with attacking ca&s;tles in the air, was a&s;toni&s;hed, that feder|ali&s;m &s;hould be treated as a hear&s;ay in politics. He ob&s;erved, that Greece, &s;o celebrated and &s;o proli&s;ic of great men and heroic actions, was compo&s;ed of &s;mall confederate repub|lics: that the United States, whch in our days exhibit the mo&s;t intere&s;ting picture of a good &s;ocial organization, are a compo&s;ition of the &s;ame nature: and that Switzerland afforded a &s;imilar example. That at the pre&s;ent moment indeed, and in the actual &s;ituation of France, it was im|portant for it to pre&s;erve its unity; becau&s;e in this way it pre&s;ented a more formidable ma&s;s to foreign powers, and a &s;inglene&s;s of action which it was highly expedient to keep up for the completion of tho&s;e laws on which it d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pended for a con&s;titution: that it could not however be denied; there would ever be a laxity in political bands, uniting a Fleming and a native of Provence; that it was difficult to diffu&s;e that attachment, in which the &s;trength of a repub|lic con&s;i&s;ts, over a &s;urface &s;o exten&s;ive; becau&s;e the love of our country is not &s;trictly that of the land we inhabit, but of the citizens with whom we live, and the laws by which they are governed, without which the Athenians would never have transferred their exi&s;tence from their city to their &s;hips; that we can never thoroughly love any but tho&s;e whom we know; and that the enthu&s;ia&s;m of men &s;eparated by a di&s;tance of &s;ix hundred miles can never be general, uniform, and lively, like that of the inhabi|tants of a little &s;tate.</P>
<P>THESE &s;age reflections, e&s;teemed as &s;uch by mo&s;t of tho&s;e who heard them, were reported and denounced by Clootz as a con&s;piracy to federalize France, and to

He repre&s;ented Buzot as the mo&s;t dangerous of the con&s;pirators, Roland as their chief, and the members who vi&s;ited me mo&s;t frequently as abettors of this <HI>liberticide project.</HI> I know not whether a madman like Clootz may have been &s;incere in his appre|hen&s;ions. I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf of it; but rather, that he &s;aw, in the fabrication of his lie, an opportunity of revenging his vanity, offended at not being admired; a &s;ubject for declaiming in his own way, extremely &s;uitable to the turgidity of his &s;tyle, and the di&s;order of his imagi|nation; the occa&s;ion of injuring men, who&s;e rea&s;on mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily di&s;plea&s;e him, and of making a common cau&s;e with tho&s;e in who&s;e vices he delights: even &s;uppo&s;ing him to have no &s;ecret mi&s;&s;ion to embroil France, by the help of extravagant patriots, in order to clear the way for his countrymen, the Pru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the ma&s;&s;acres continued; at the Abbey, from Sunday evening till Tue&s;day morning; at the Force, &s;till longer, and four days at Bic&egrave;tre. To my pre&s;ent abode, in the fir&s;t of tho&s;e pri&s;ons, I am indebted for a knowledge of particulars, at which humanity &s;hud|ders, and which I have not the heart to relate. One circum&s;tance, however, I will not pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, becau&s;e it helps to demon&s;trate, that it was a deep-laid &s;cheme. It is this: the police having a receiving-hou&s;e in the Fauxbourgh St. Germain, where it depo&s;its the pri&s;oners which the Abbey cannot admit, when too much crowded, cho&s;e Sunday evening for their removal, the very in&s;tant before the general ma&s;&s;acre. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were prepared, fell upon the carriages, which were five or &s;ix hackney coaches, and with their &s;words and pikes

&s;tabbed, and murdered, all that they contained, in the middle of the &s;treet, and unre&s;trained by their &s;ad and heart-rending cries. All Paris witne&s;&s;ed the&s;e horrible &s;cenes, perpetrated by a &s;mall number of cut-throats: &s;o &s;mall indeed, that they &s;carcely exceeded a dozen at the Abbey, the gate of which was guarded by two national guards only, notwith&s;tanding the requi&s;itions made to the commune and the commandant.

<P>THE public force was badly organized, as it is &s;till; for a lawle&s;s banditti, when determined to domineer, take care to oppo&s;e all kind of order, that may ob&s;truct their proceedings.

The fact is, that the rumour of a pretended con&s;piracy in the pri&s;ons, improbable as it was, and the affected annunciation of the unea&s;ine&s;s and rage of the people, kept every one in a &s;tate of &s;tupefac|tion; and made him believe, while trembling within doors, that it was the people who were the actors: whereas, it appears from the be&s;t accounts, that there were not two hundred villains concerned in the whole of tho&s;e infamo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proceedings.

<P>ROLAND's health was impaired by it.

He grew yel|low and weak, but retained his u&s;ual activity; and while unable to eat, or &s;leep, continued his labours without in|termi&s;&s;ion. He was &s;till ignorant of a warrant having been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him; for though it had come to my knowledge, I took great care to keep the &s;ecret, as it could only have tended to feed an affection that had al|ready gained too much ground: &s;omebody, however, I know not who, took it in his head to mention it the following week. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that it &s;ome|times happened to him to &s;tate the particular fact in &s;uch a way, that his enemies affected to believe, his in|veighing again&s;t tho&s;e ma&s;&s;acres aro&s;e only from the fears he had entertained of being comprehended in the number of the victims; while, in reality, to the ju&s;t horror, with which they had in&s;pired him, he only join|ed his indignation, at having been included in the number of the pro&s;cribed.</P>

<P>VARIOUS circum&s;tances concurring to &s;hew that the pri&s;oners from Orleans, who&s;e removal had been order|ed, and who were already on the road, could not be brought to Paris without danger, the mini&s;ter of the interior gave orders, in conformity with the opinion of the council, to conduct them to Ver&s;ailles; and a numerous e&s;cort was &s;ent off for that purpo&s;e. Men who affected horror at the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inations of Paris, contrived by means of that di&s;gui&s;e, to make part of it, and were the directors of the &s;laughter that took place on the arrival of the pri&s;oners at Ver&s;ailles.</P>

went every length, making a forcible &s;eizure of watches, &s;hoe-buckles, and ear-rings, upon the <HI>boulevards,</HI> and in the market-places, in open day.

<P>THE robbery of the <HI>Garde-meuble</HI> was effected, and millions fell into the hands of per&s;ons, who would natu|rally employ them to perpetuate that anarchy from which they derived their power.</P>
<P>ON the day that &s;ucceeded this important theft, d'Eg|lantine called at our hou&s;e at eleven in the morning; d'Eglantine, who had never made his appearance there &s;ince the matins of September; and who the la&s;t time he came, told me, as if from a deep conviction of the critical &s;ituation of France, that 'things would never go well without a concentration of powers: the executive council, &s;aid he, mu&s;t have the dictator&s;hip; and the pre&s;ident mu&s;t be the man to exerci&s;e it&punc; &mdash;D'Eglantine did not find me at home; for I had ju&s;t gone out with madam Petion. He waited two hours; and at my re|turn, I found him in the court-yard. He walked up &s;tairs with me, uninvited; and &s;tayed an hour and half, without being a&s;ked to &s;it down. He lamented in a hy|pocritical tone the robbery of that night, which deprived the nation of &s;o much real wealth; inquired, whether any information concerning the parties had been obtained; and wondered much at its not having been fore&s;een. He talked afterwards of Robe&s;pierre and of Marat, who had begun their attacks upon Roland and my&s;elf, as
<PB N="124" REF="034483_0122_0FFDE99EE7CF4CA8">

I let him talk on, &s;aid very little and took care not to &s;peak out. At length he withdrew and I have never &s;een him from that day to this; nor could I ever clearly comprehend the purpo&s;e of this &s;ingular vi&s;it. It is a my&s;tery that time mu&s;t unfold.</P>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t &s;aid, that Marat was beginning to &s;lander us; and it &s;hould be &s;aid al&s;o, that, the moment the a&s;|&s;embly had ordered a &s;um to be left at the di&s;po&s;al of the mini&s;ter of the home department for printing u&s;eful works, Marat, who, the day after the 10th of Augu&s;t, had got <HI>his people</HI> to carry away four pre&s;&s;es from the royal printing hou&s;e, by way of indemnifying him for tho&s;e which had been &s;eized by the hand of ju&s;tice, wrote to Roland for fifteen thou&s;and livres [&pound;. 625], to enable him to publi&s;h &s;ome very excellent things. Roland made an&s;wer, that the &s;um was too great to be delivered, without knowing the purpo&s;e for which it was to be employed; but that if Marat would &s;end him his manu&s;cripts, he would lay them before the council, who would determine whether it were proper to publi&s;h them at the expence of the nation. Marat replied in a bad &s;tyle, a thing he is very capable of, and &s;ent a heap of manu&s;cripts, the very &s;ight of which was enough to frighten one. There was an e&s;&s;ay on <HI>the chains of &s;lavery,</HI> and I know not what be&s;ides, bearing evident marks of the author's pen, which is characteri&s;ing them &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;ometimes doubted; whether Marat were not
<PB N="125" REF="034483_0123_0FFDE99C40CEECA8">
a fictitious entity: but I was then convinced, that &s;uch a being really exi&s;ted. I &s;poke of him to Danton, ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee him, and begged he would bring him to our hou&s;e; for mon&s;ters are de&s;erving of attention, and I was de&s;irous of knowing whether he were out of his wits, or a well-prompted actor. Danton declined it, as a thing perfectly u&s;ele&s;s, and even di&s;agreeable, &s;ince it would be only making me acquainted with an original like nothing el&s;e in the world. Judging from the manner in which he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, that he would not gratify my longing, even if I in&s;i&s;ted on it, I pretended not to have been &s;erious in my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>THE council decided, that Marat's manu&s;cripts &s;hould be put into the hands of Danton, who would find means to &s;ettle the matter in &s;ome way or other. This was cutting the gordian knot, in&s;tead of untying it. It did not become the mini&s;ter of the home department to ex|pend the public money in feeing a madman, nor was it prudent to make him an enemy: but a plain and direct refu&s;al from the council would have &s;et the que&s;tion at re&s;t. Entru&s;ting this office to Danton was affording him fre&s;h means of ingratiating him&s;elf with the mad dog in que&s;tion, and of turning him loo&s;e upon every body he might wi&s;h him to worry.</P>
<P>THREE weeks more had pa&s;&s;ed away, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Septembrizing</HI> was at an end. Marat had the im|pudence to po&s;t up a demand of fifteen thou&s;and livres from d'Orleans, complaining bitterly of the want of <HI>civi&s;m</HI> which Roland &s;howed by refu&s;ing him that &s;um, and this when he had ju&s;t &s;tuck up a bill, in which I was attached by name. I was not to be &s;o deceived.&mdash;

<P>ROLAND made his report concerning the &s;tate of Paris on the 22d of September.

He did ju&s;tice to the zeal of the com|mune of the 10th, and acknowledged the great &s;ervices it rendered to the revolution on that important day: but he &s;hewed, that the prolongation of revolutionary mea&s;ures produced preci&s;ely the rever&s;e of what was hoped for; &s;ince tyranny was only de&s;troyed with a view of introducing the reign of ju&s;tice and order, not le&s;s aver&s;e from anarchy than from de&s;poti&s;m it&s;elf; he con|cluded by pointing out the propriety and difficulty of ob|taining accounts from the commune, from which he had repeatedly demanded them in vain.</P>

It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to conceive a &s;ituation more painful, than that of a firm and upright man, who, while at the head of an important department, appearing to po&s;|&s;e&s;s con&s;iderable power, and lying under a heavy re&s;pon|&s;ibility, is obliged to be the daily witne&s;s of &s;hocking abu|&s;es, of which the denunciation alone belongs to him, and which the legi&s;lative authority either wants means or cou|rage to repre&s;s. To ca&s;hier the commune, to order a new municipality to be elected according to the forms pre|&s;cribed by law, to organize the public force, and to have a commander appointed by the &s;ections; the&s;e were the only mea&s;ures capable of re&s;toring order, without which the laws would be appealed to in vain, and the convention would nece&s;&s;arily become &s;ubject to the municipal autho|rity, which defied all re&s;traint. In this &s;tate of things, I would rather have wi&s;hed Roland to dedicate his talents to his country as a repre&s;entative of the people, than as mem|ber of a council without energy, and mini&s;ter of a govern|ment without power. I did not conceal this way of thinking from a few per&s;ons capable of e&s;timating it properly; for as to the vulgar, they would never have been able to un|der&s;tand how any one could prefer a mode&s;t &s;ituation to the "pride, pomp, and circum&s;tance," of a place in the mi|ni&s;try; and for want of &s;eeing the matter in a proper light, would have been apt to form very &s;illy conjectures.</P>
<P>THE department of the Somme, in which Roland had long re&s;ided, elected him a member of the conven|tion. This choice excited almo&s;t univer&s;al regret. It appeared incon&s;iderate and ab&s;urd to take from the helm a man of integrity, courage and under&s;tanding, whom it

would be difficult to replace; in order to put him into an a&s;&s;embly, where &s;o many others might &s;erve the &s;tate by their votes as well as he, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing equal abilities. Roland &s;aw no room for he&s;itation. He wrote to the a&s;|&s;embly in con&s;equence, reque&s;ting that his place might be filled up, and pointing out the per&s;on whom he thought be&s;t qualified to &s;ucceed him. This news occa&s;ioned extra|ordinary agitation: great was the outcry on all &s;ides; and a motion was made, that he &s;hould be invited to remain in the mini&s;try. The convention had already formed it&s;elf into a body, compo&s;ed of the great number of members of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly who were re-elected, and of the new members who arrived fir&s;t from the country; or el&s;e the latter took their &s;eats in the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly. Which of the two was the ca&s;e I do not perfectly recollect at this moment, when I have no documents by me: but Danton was pre&s;ent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I remember that, for more than a month, he continued to officiate at the council, while he went and voted in the a&s;&s;embly. This concentra|tion of power in one per&s;on appeared highly improper to Roland, who, du|ring the la&s;t fortnight that Danton proceeded in this manner, kept away from a council, influenced by a man who had no longer any right to &s;it there.</NOTE>, and ro&s;e to oppo&s;e this invitation with great warmth. His impetuo&s;ity betrayed his rancour, and led him to &s;ay many ridiculous things: among others that they ought to addde&s;s the invitation to me al&s;o, as a per&s;on by no means u&s;ele&s;s to Roland's admini&s;tration. Murmurs of di&s;approbation repelled the invidious in|&s;inuation; but the decree did not pa&s;s, though the ge|neral wi&s;h was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed. Neither was the offer of re&s;ignation accepted, and Roland remained &s;till
<PB N="129" REF="034483_0127_0FFDE99AAEA8A808">
free to make his option. A crowd of members repaired to his hou&s;e, to entreat him not to quit the mini&s;try. They pre&s;&s;ed the matter home to him, as a &s;acrifice he owed to his country, and a&s;&s;ured him that the convention, when once complete, would bring the public affairs to a grand and deci&s;ive i&s;&s;ue, which his &s;pirit and activity would help to advance, and by which he would be &s;upported. Two days had pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e &s;olicitations, when news was brought, that his election was void, becau&s;e made in lieu of another erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be null; and that con&s;e|quently he had no rea&s;on to quit the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY he re&s;olved to keep his place; and wrote to the a&s;&s;embly in a courageous and dignified &s;tyle, which was crowned with the plaudits of the majority, and made his enemies tremble. His election proved void in rea|lity, but this was a circum&s;tance; that Danton's party en|deavoured to conceal till he &s;hould have quitted the mi|ni&s;try, in order that he might be thrown out of every &s;ituation. That party no longer gave him any quarter; every day produced &s;ome fre&s;h attack: Marat's journal, pamphlets compo&s;ed for the purpo&s;e, and denunciations at the Jacobins, kept repeating ince&s;&s;ant calumnies and accu|&s;ations, each more &s;tupid or more atrocious than its pre|dece&s;&s;or. But effrontery and per&s;everance in things of this kind are &s;ure to &s;ucceed with a people naturally fickle and &s;u&s;picious. They even went &s;o far as to im|pute to him as a crime, what ought to have procured him prai&s;e; and had the art of in&s;piring hone&s;t men of weak nerves with alarm at that very &s;olicitude, which tended mo&s;t to the &s;afety of the republic; I mean his care to inform the public mind. It requires no profound

&s;kill in politics to know, that the &s;trength of a government depends upon opinion; and accordingly all the difference that exi&s;ts in this re&s;pect between a tyrannical admini&s;tra|tion, and one which takes ju&s;tice for its guide, is, that the former is employed wholly in contracting the &s;phere of knowledge, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing truth, while the latter makes it a rule to diffu&s;e them as widely as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;embly rightly judged that the events of the 10th of Augu&s;t would produce different impre&s;&s;ions, according to the prejudices or intere&s;ts of individuals, and the man|ner, in which they &s;hould be repre&s;ented, directed a nar|rative of the facts to be drawn up, decreed that it &s;hould be printed, &s;upported it by the publication of all the do|cuments that tended to prove its accuracy, ordered the mi|ni&s;ter of the home department to di&s;patch them to every part of France, and enjoined him to promote the writing of pamphlets conducive to the &s;ame end.</P>
<P>ROLAND felt that, in the circum&s;tances of the times, the art of diffu&s;ing information needed improvement, and that it was requi&s;ite to produce a &s;tream of light, that might in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upply the want of public in|&s;truction, ever too much neglected. By means of the inquiries he &s;et on foot in the departments, he found out and retained a &s;mall number of zealous and enlightened men, on who&s;e fidelity, in di&s;tributing &s;uch writing as might be &s;ent to them, he thought he could rely. He made it a rule to an&s;wer every body, and to keep up a corre&s;pondence with all the popular &s;ocieties, country clergymen, and private per&s;ons, who might apply to him. He &s;ent to the &s;ocieties a circular letter, remind|ing
<PB N="131" REF="034483_0129_0FFDE968EE6749A8">
them of the &s;pirit of their in&s;titution, and calling them back to the fraternal care of in&s;tructing and enlightening each other, from which they had but too great a tendency to depart, in order to debate on public mea&s;ures, and in|terfere with the government. He &s;elected from among his clerks three or four intelligent men to carry on this <HI>pa|triotic corre&s;pondence,</HI> and di&s;patch the printed tracts, in|tru&s;ting the principal management to him among them who had mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of heart, &s;trictne&s;s of principle, and amenity of &s;tyle; and this corre&s;pondence he frequent|ly animated by his own circular letters, dictated by cir|cum&s;tances, and always breathing that morality, and couched in tho&s;e terms of affection, which engage men's hearts. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the excellent effect that the&s;e things produced: troubles of every kind &s;ub&s;ided; the admini&s;trative bodies executed their functions with re|gularity; and five or &s;ix hundred &s;ocieties, and a con&s;ider|able number of country clergymen, employed them&s;elves with laudable zeal in diffu&s;ing in&s;truction, and in attaching to the public weal men hitherto occupied in their manual labours, but at the &s;ame time lo&s;t in ignorance, and more di&s;po&s;ed to hug their chains, than to maintain that free|dom, of which they neither knew the extent, nor the limits, nor the duties, nor the rights.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>patriotic corre&s;pondence</HI> is a valuable monument, equally atte&s;ting the pure principles and enlightened vigi|lance of the mini&s;ter, the good will of a great number of intelligent citizens, and the admirable fruits of wi&s;dom, patrioti&s;m, and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>IN the thing it&s;elf, and in its effects, &s;u&s;picious and jealous men &s;aw le&s;s the triumph of freedom the main|tenance

of tranquillity, and the con&s;olidation of the re|public, than the fame and reputation that might accrue to the fir&s;t mover. From that moment Roland was repre|&s;ented as a dangerous man, who had <HI>offices of public &s;pirit</HI>; &s;oon after as a corruptor of the people's opinions, and a man ambitious of the &s;upreme power; and la&s;t of all, as a con&s;pirator.</P>
<P>ALL that was wanting was to read his writings, and examine his corre&s;pondence. The departments, that re|ceived his letters, an&s;wered him with their warme&s;t thanks; but the banditti of Paris, always calumniating, and never proving any thing, excited by means of a thou&s;and &s;trata|gems, a &s;ort of di&s;tru&s;t in the public mind, which the ja|cobins &s;econded with all their power, for they were no longer &s;wayed by any body but the Dantons, the Robe&s;|pierres, and the Marats.</P>

<P>MORE than two months have I been impri&s;oned, be|cau&s;e I am allied to a worthy man, who thought proper to retain his virtue in a revolution, and to give in exact accounts though a mini&s;ter. For five months he &s;olicited in vain the pa&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e accounts, and the pronouncing of judgment on his admini&s;tration. They have been examined; but, as they have afforded no room for blame, it has been deemed expedient to make no report on the &s;ubject, but to &s;ub&s;titute calumny in its place. Roland's activity, his multifarious labours, and his in|&s;tructive writings, had procured him a degree of con|&s;ideration which appeared formidable; or &s;o at lea&s;t en|vious

men would have it, in order to effect the downfal of a man who&s;e integrity they dete&s;ted. His ruin was re&s;olved upon, and an attempt was made to take him into cu&s;tody at the time of the in&s;urrection of the 31&s;t of May; the epoch of the complete deba&s;ement of the national re|pre&s;entation, of its violation, and of the &s;ucce&s;s of the decemvirate. He made his e&s;cape, and in their fury fa&s;ten|ed upon me; but I &s;hould have been arre&s;ted at any rate; for though our per&s;ecutors know that my name has not the &s;ame influence as his, they are per&s;uaded that my temper is not le&s;s firm, and are almo&s;t equally de&s;irous of my ruin.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of my captivity I employed in writing. My pen proceeded with &s;o much rapidity, and I was in &s;o happy a di&s;po&s;ition of mind, that in le&s;s than a month I had manu&s;cripts &s;ufficient to form a duodecimo volume. They were intitled Hi&s;torical Notices, and contained a variety of particulars relative to all the facts, and all the per&s;ons, connected with public affairs, that my &s;ituation had given me an opportunity of knowing. I related them with all the freedom and energy of my nature, with all the openne&s;s and uncon&s;traint of an ingenuous mind, &s;etting it&s;elf above &s;elfi&s;h con&s;idera|tions, with all the plea&s;ure which re&s;ults from de&s;cribing what we have experienced, or what we feel, and la&s;tly with the confidence, that, happen what would, the collec|tion would &s;erve as my moral and political te&s;tament.</P>
<P>I HAD completed the whole, bringing things down to the pre&s;ent moment, and had entru&s;ted it to a friend, who rated it at a high price. On a &s;udden the &s;torm bur&s;t over his head. The in&s;tant he found him&s;elf put under arre&s;t, he thought of nothing but the danger, he
<PB N="134" REF="034483_0132_0FFDE96F66E035A0">
felt nothing but the nece&s;&s;ity of averting it, and without ca&s;ting about for expedients, threw my manu&s;cript into the fire. This lo&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me more than the &s;evere&s;t trials have ever done. This will ea&s;ily be conceived, when it is remembered that the cri&s;is approaches, that I may be murdered to-morrow, or dragged, I know not how, before the tribunal which our rulers employ to rid them of the per&s;ons they find trouble&s;ome; and that the&s;e writings were the anchor to which I had com|mitted my hopes of &s;aving my own memory from re|proach, as well as that of many de&s;erving characters.</P>
<P>AS we ought not, however, to &s;ink under any event, I &s;hall employ my lei&s;ure hours in &s;etting down, without form or order, whatever may occur to my mind. The&s;e fragments will not make amends for what I have lo&s;t, but they will &s;erve to recall it to my memory, and a&s;&s;i&s;t me in filling up the void on &s;ome future day, provided the means of doing &s;o remain in my power.</P>

<HEAD>BUZOT.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN of an exalted mind, high &s;pirit, and impetuous courage, endowed with great &s;en&s;ibility, ardent, melan|choly, and indolent, cannot but &s;ometimes run into ex|tremes. A great admirer of nature, feeding his imagi|nation with all the charms &s;he has to offer, and his mind with the principles of the mo&s;t amiable philo&s;ophy, he &s;eems formed to ta&s;te and to confer dome&s;tic happine&s;s: he would forget the whole world in the placid enjoy|ment of private virtues with a heart worthy of his own. But, thrown into public life, he attends to nothing but the laws of rigid equity, and defends them at all ha|zards. Ea&s;ily rou&s;ed to indignation again&s;t inju&s;tice, he a&s;&s;ails it with ardour, and is incapable of entering into a compo&s;ition with guilt. The friend of human nature, &s;u&s;ceptible of the tendere&s;t &s;eelings, and capable of the &s;ublime&s;t flights and mo&s;t generous re&s;olutions, he loves his fellow-creatures, and, like a true republican, is ever ready to &s;acrifice him&s;elf for their good: but a &s;evere judge of individuals, and cautious in &s;electing the objects of his e&s;teem, he be&s;tows his friend&s;hip upon few. This re&s;erve, added to the energetic freedom with which he
<PB N="136" REF="034483_0134_0FFDE99402068E00">
expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, has drawn upon him a charge of haughtine&s;s, and made him many enemies. Mediocrity &s;carcely ever forgives merit; but vice dete&s;ts and per|&s;ecutes that courageous virtue, which &s;ets it at defiance. Buzot is the gentle&s;t man on earth with his friends, but the roughe&s;t adver&s;ary a knave can have to do with. While yet a young man, the ripene&s;s of his judgment, and purity of his morals, obtained him the e&s;teem and confidence of his fellow-citizens. Their confidence and e&s;teem were ju&s;tified by his devotion to truth, and by his firmne&s;s and per&s;everance in &s;peaking it. Men of vulgar minds, who depreciate what they cannot attain, call his penetration a revery, his warmth pa&s;&s;ion, his &s;trong re|marks &s;atire, and his oppo&s;ition to all violent mea&s;ures a revolt again&s;t the majority. He was accu&s;ed of <HI>royali&s;m,</HI> becau&s;e he a&s;&s;erted, that morals were nece&s;&s;ary in a re|public, and that nothing &s;hould be omitted that may tend to maintain or correct them; of <HI>calumniating Paris,</HI> be|cau&s;e he abhorred the ma&s;&s;acres of September, and a&s;crib|ed them to a handful of cut-throats hired by robbers; of a <HI>ari&s;tocracy,</HI> becau&s;e he wi&s;hed to call upon the people to exerci&s;e its &s;overeignty by pa&s;&s;ing judgment on Lewis XVI; of <HI>federali&s;m,</HI> becau&s;e he in&s;i&s;ted upon the maintenance of equality among all the departments, and oppo&s;ed the municipal tyranny of an overweening com|mune. Such were his crimes. He had his errors al&s;o. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a noblene&s;s of countenance, and elegance of &s;hape, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with that care, neatne&s;s, and decorum, which be&s;peak a love of order, a &s;en&s;e of pro|priety, and that re&s;pect which a well-bred man owes to the public and to him&s;elf.</P>

hands of men, who made patrioti&s;m con&s;i&s;t in flattering the people, in order to mi&s;lead them; in overturning and invading every thing, by way of procuring con&s;equence and wealth; in libelling the laws; that they might govern ac|cording to their own di&s;cretion; in protecting licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, as a mean of procuring impunity for their crimes; in cutting throats, on purpo&s;e to perpetuate their power; and in &s;wearing, drinking, and dre&s;&s;ing like porters, in order to fraterni&s;e with wretches like them&s;elves; Buzot &s;till pro|fe&s;&s;ied the morality of a Socrates, and retained the polite|ne&s;s of a Scipio.&mdash;What a villain!&mdash;Accordingly the <HI>up|right</HI> Lacroix, the <HI>judicious</HI> Chabot, the <HI>gentle</HI> Lindet, the <HI>mode&s;t</HI> Thuriot, the <HI>learned</HI> Duroi, the <HI>humane</HI> Danton, and their faithful imitators, have declared him a traitor to his country: they have had his hou&s;e razed, and his property confi&s;cated, as in former days Ari&s;tides was bani&s;hed, and Phocion condemned to die. I am a&s;toni&s;hed at their not pa&s;&s;ing a decree, making it felony to remember his name. It would have been more con&s;i&s;tent with their views, than their attempts to pre&s;erve it coupled with epithets, that are di&s;proved by the evidence of facts.</P>
<P>THEY cannot expunge from the page of hi&s;tory Buzot's conduct in the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly; nor &s;uppre&s;s his judi|cious motions, and vigorous &s;allies in the convention. How|ever his opinions may be fal&s;ified by faithle&s;s journals, the principles by which they are &s;upported are &s;till to be per|ceived through the di&s;gui&s;e. Buzot frequently &s;poke off|hand; was indolent in other re&s;pects; but never failed to &s;tand up again&s;t all perver&s;e &s;y&s;tems of politics, and every plan that appeared prejudicial to liberty. His report on the departmental guard, a project &s;o much decried, con|tains
<PB N="138" REF="034483_0136_0FFDE9768C7DE428">
arguments that have never been an&s;wered. That con|cerning the law propo&s;ed again&s;t in&s;tigators to murder di&s;|plays the &s;ounde&s;t policy, and a &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy, as true as it is natural, and as &s;trong as the rea&s;on by which it is upheld. His propo&s;al for the bani&s;hment of the Bourbons is developed with preci&s;ion, &s;upported by the mo&s;t ac|curate rea&s;oning, and written with equal elegance and feeling. His opinion on the judgment of the king, while it abounds with facts and arguments, is free from that declamation and irrelevance of matter in which &s;o many others indulged in their harangues upon that im|portant &s;ubject. And la&s;tly, his letters to his con&s;tituents, of the 6th and 22d of January, depict his mind with &s;uch truth as will make them long an object of attention. A few combatants of his &s;trength might have given the con|vention the impul&s;ion which is wanted: but the re&s;t of the men of talents, keeping them&s;elves back as <HI>orators</HI> for great occa&s;ions, were too neglectful of the petty warfare which was carried on every day; nor were they &s;ufficient|ly aware of the tactics to which their adver&s;aries were for|ced by their mediocrity to re&s;ort.</P>

<P>A TRULY hone&s;t and good-natured man, is equally incapable of doing the lea&s;t thing repugnant to ju&s;tice, of inflicting the &s;lighe&s;t injury, or of giving the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s to any one. In regard to him&s;elf, he can ne|glect many things, but knows not how to refu&s;e a favour
<PB N="139" REF="034483_0137_0FFDE9915193D120">
to any per&s;on in the world. The &s;erenity of a good con&s;cience, the mildne&s;s of an ea&s;y temper, with frank|ne&s;s and cheerfulne&s;s, are depicted in his countenance. He was a prudent mayor, and faithful repre&s;entative: but he is too &s;anguine, and too peaceable, to fore&s;ee or to lay a &s;torm. Sound judgment, good intentions, and what is termed ju&s;tne&s;s of thought, are the charac|teri&s;tics of his opinions and writings, which bear &s;tronger marks of good &s;en&s;e than of talents. As an orator he is cold; as a writer his &s;tile is loo&s;e. An equitable mini|&s;ter, and a good citizen, he was formed for the practice of the &s;ocial virtues in a republic, and not to found a republican government among a corrupt people, who for &s;ome time idolized him, and then rejoiced at his pro&s;crip|tion, as at that of an enemy.</P>
<P>AT the time of the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, during the revi&s;ion of the laws, I was one day with Buzot's wife, when her hu&s;band returned at a late hour from the a&s;&s;embly, and brought P&eacute;tion with him to dinner. It was at that period when the court affected to con&s;ider them as factious men, and de&s;cribed them as intriguers entirely occupied in exciting di&s;turbances. After din|ner, Petion, who was &s;itting on a large &s;ofa, began to play with a young pointer, with all the earne&s;tne&s;s of a child, till at length they both grew tired, and fell a&s;leep <HI>in one another's arms.</HI> The conver&s;ation of four per&s;ons did not prevent P&eacute;tion from &s;noring. 'Do but look at that &s;ower of &s;edition.' &s;aid Buzot, with a &s;mile: 'we were eyed a&s;kance as we were quiting the hall; and our accu&s;ers, very bu&s;y about party intrigues them&s;elves, imagine that we are engaged in &s;imilar manoeuvres.'</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="034483_0138_0FFDE97932738700">THE circum&s;tance, and the remark, have often recor|red to my mind, &s;ince the&s;e unfortunate latter times when P&eacute;tion and Buzot are accu&s;ed and pro&s;cribed as royali&s;ts, with as much rea&s;on as the court then had to charge them with intrigue. Always alone with their principles, or a&s;&s;ociating with none but men who profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame, in order to di&s;cu&s;s their opinions; they thought it would &s;uffice to contend ob&s;tinately for ju&s;tice, to &s;peak the truth con&s;tantly, and to &s;acrifice them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t to run every hazard, rather than betray &s;o good a cau&s;e.&mdash;And yet the&s;e are the men that are declared <HI>traitors to their country.</HI></P>
<P>I WILL here record a fact of &s;ome con&s;equence. It has been &s;een el&s;ewhere, that during the fir&s;t patriotic admini&s;tration, it had been agreed upon, that the mi|ni&s;ter for foreign affairs &s;hould take from the fund al|lotted to his department for &s;ecret &s;ervice money cer|tain &s;ums, which were to be put into the hands of the mayor of Paris, as well for the police, which was re|duced to nothing for want of means, as for publica|tions to counteract the influence of tho&s;e of the court. Dumouriez having quitted that department, the matter was mentioned to d'Abancourt, that is to &s;ay, as far as regarded the money wanting for the police alone. D'Abancourt would do nothing in it him&s;elf; but pre|tended, that it was a bu&s;ine&s;s, which the king &s;hould be brought to approve, and of which his maje&s;ty would not fail to &s;ee the ju&s;tice. The propo&s;al was not at all to the ta&s;te of the king, who an&s;wered in direct terms, that he would not buy rods to whip him&s;elf. In this he &s;poke &s;en&s;ibly enough, as he was not a &s;in|cere

friend to the con&s;titution; and &s;uch an an&s;wer might have been expected. But a few days after, La|croix, the pre&s;ent colleague of Danton, in concert with whom he is plundering Belgium; Lacroix, the per&s;e|cutor of hone&s;t men, and the &s;overeign of the day, who then had a &s;eat in the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, and who was know to frequent the palace, called upon P&eacute;tion to promi&s;e him the free di&s;po&s;al of three millions of livres [&pound;125,000] if he would employ them in &s;uch a way as to &s;upport his maje&s;ty; a propo&s;ition which mu&s;t needs have been more offen&s;ive to P&eacute;tion, in his character of mayor, than the other could have been to Louis XVI. It was accordingly rejected, notwith&s;tanding the peculiarly kind reception he met with at that very time from the king; for being &s;ent for to the palace, in&s;tead of find|ing the monarch, whom he had never before &s;een alone, &s;urrounded as u&s;ual, he was introduced into his clo&s;et, where there appeared to be no one el&s;e, and where Louis XVI. lavi&s;hed upon him many marks of affabi|lity and regard, and even tho&s;e little captivating cajo|leries, which he had the art of di&s;tributing at will. A &s;light ru&s;tling of &s;ilk behind the hangings made P&eacute;tion imagine that the queen was pre&s;ent without being vi&s;ible, and the care&s;&s;es of Louis convinced him of his hypo|cri&s;y; he remained firm and hone&s;t, without yielding to the king, who was trying to corrupt him, in like manner as, without flattering the people, he wi&s;hed to appeal to them on the trial of that very king; while Lacroix, who had &s;erved him, and had probably been well paid for his &s;ervices, thought that he could not be too &s;peedily condemned to die.</P>

<HEAD>PACHE.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;aid with rea&s;on, that the talent of know|ing mankind is of the fir&s;t importance to tho&s;e who go|vern, their errors in that particular being always the mo&s;t fatal. But the exerci&s;e of this talent, at all times &s;o dif|ficult, becomes infinitely more &s;o in the time of a revolu|tion; there is be&s;ides a degree of hypocri&s;y, by which it is no di&s;grace to be duped, &s;ince a man mu&s;t be wicked him&s;elf to &s;u&s;pect its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IN my youthful days, I had met, at the hou&s;e of one of my relations, a clerk in the po&s;t office, of the name of Gibert, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that mildne&s;s of manners which generally accompanies a ta&s;te for the fine arts. Gibert, a man of cultivated mind, and an affectionate father, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with painting, made a &s;tudy of mu&s;ic, and by his &s;trict probity obtained the e&s;teem of all his acquaintance. He was extremely attached to a man, his mo&s;t particular friend, who&s;e extraordinary merit he extolled with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of an affectionate heart, and with all the mode&s;ty of a per&s;on who thought him&s;elf far his inferior. I was &s;ometimes in company with this friend; in whom there was nothing remarkable at fir&s;t &s;ight, but his extreme &s;implicity. I had, however, no opportunity of forming a judgment of him, for I met with him but &s;eldom, and did not often &s;ee Gibert him&s;elf; I only learnt that his friend, who was <HI>Pache,</HI> being enamoured of a country life, the only one &s;uited to his patriarchal manners, and in love with liberty, of which his well-informed mind enabled him to e&s;timate all the
<PB N="143" REF="034483_0141_0FFDE98EA6D740A8">
advantages, was about to re&s;ign a genteel place under the French government, to &s;ettle with his family in Switzerland. I afterwards learnt, that having lo&s;t his wife, and perceiving that his children regretted Paris, and that the revolution was paving the way for our national eman|cipation, he had taken the re&s;olution of returning; and that being &s;atisfied with the independence he had derived from the &s;ale of his former property, and the fortunate purcha&s;e of a national e&s;tate, he had &s;ent back the grant of a pen&s;ion to a quondam mini&s;ter by who&s;e intere&s;t it had been obtained.</P>
<P>IT was not nece&s;&s;ary to be often in Gibert's company, and to know his intimacy with Pache, to be informed of every thing that could be &s;aid to the latter's advantage. In the month of January, 1792, he brought him to our hou&s;e, and I &s;aw him from time to time. Pache, as I have already ob&s;erved, wears an appearance of the utmo&s;t mode&s;ty. It is &s;o great indeed, that you would be tempted to adopt the opinion he &s;eems to entertain of him&s;elf, and take him for a thing of no great value. But credit is given him for that mode&s;ty, when it is di&s;covered that he rea&s;ons well, and is by no means wanting in information. As he is extremely re&s;erved, and never unbo&s;oms him&s;elf freely, people &s;oon &s;u&s;pect him to know more than he &s;ays, and end with a&s;cribing to him more merit than he po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es, becau&s;e they were very near committing the inju&s;tice of allowing him none. A per&s;on who talks little, li&s;tens with an air of intelligence to every &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and ventures a few well-timed ob&s;ervations, ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;es for a man of &s;en&s;e. Pache had made an acquaintance with Meunieurs and Monge, both members of the academy of
<PB N="144" REF="034483_0142_0FFDE981441AB860">
&s;ciences; and had helped them to form a popular &s;ociety in the &s;ection of the Luxembourg, the object of which, they &s;aid, was the diffu&s;ion of information, and the en|couragement of patriotic &s;entiments. Pache was very a&s;&s;iduous in this &s;ociety; and appeared to dedicate to his country, as a citizen, all the time which he did not devote to his children, and which intervened between the public lectures, whither he attended them.</P>
<P>I HAVE related el&s;ewhere how Roland was called to the mini&s;try at the end of March of the &s;ame year. The of|fices were filled with agents of the old government, little di&s;po&s;ed to favour the new; but they were ac|cu&s;tomed to the routine of bu&s;ine&s;s; and it would have been wrong to hazard unhinging the whole of a great ma|chine, in tho&s;e trouble&s;ome times, for the &s;ake of changing a few clerks. Nothing more then was to be done but to keep a &s;trict eye over them, and to make preparations for their removal in due time. But in the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, the daily current of which hurries a man in office along with inconceivable rapidity, it cannot be denied, that he may ea&s;ily commit him&s;elf, if he do not pay the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention to every thing, an attention which becomes infinitely irk&s;ome, when the con&s;equence of di&s;|tru&s;t. In this &s;ituation, Roland was de&s;irous of finding a tru&s;ty man, whom he might have always with him in his clo&s;et, and whom he might get to read over a letter, or a report, on any urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, when other bu&s;ine&s;s &s;till more urgent, would not permit him to revi&s;e it him&s;elf: not to make any alteration in the compo&s;ition, but merely to &s;ee that the adver&s;e principles of the clerks had not influenced the manner of &s;tating facts, or drawing conclu&s;ions; a man, in &s;hort, who might
<PB N="145" REF="034483_0143_0FFDE98BFAEF18E0">
be tru&s;ted to &s;eek for a particular paper, in a particular office, or to deliver a verbal me&s;&s;age on any matter of im|portance. The idea of Pache occurred. Pache had been a clerk in the admiralty; was well acquainted with the routine of office; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abilities, patrioti&s;m, morals, which would procure a man in office credit for his appoint|ment, and that &s;implicity which never excites ill-will. The idea appeared excellent. It was mentioned to Pache, who immediately expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s to &s;erve Roland, by making him&s;elf u&s;eful to the public weal; but on con|dition of pre&s;erving his independence, by taking neither title nor &s;alary. This was beginning well. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that, when a new arrangement &s;hould take place in the office, it would be ea&s;y to &s;ee for what he was particularly fit; and Pache came to Roland's clo&s;et every morning at &s;even, with his mor&s;el of bread in his pocket, and &s;taid till three, without its being po&s;&s;ible to prevail on him to take any thing: attentive, prudent, zealous, doing his duty diligently, making an ob&s;ervation, putting in a word, to bring the argument back to the point in que&s;tion, and &s;oothing Roland, who was &s;ometimes vexed at the ari&s;tocratical contradiction of his clerks.</P>
<P>ROLAND, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was ardent, and his feelings &s;trong, rated the mildne&s;s and complai&s;ance of Pache very highly, and treated him as a valuable friend: while I, grateful for the &s;ervice I &s;uppo&s;ed him to render my hu&s;|band, lavi&s;hed on him marks of e&s;teem, and proofs of attachment. The &s;tyle of Pache was a bad one: it did not do to &s;et him about compo&s;ing a letter: it was &s;ure to be dry and flat; but he was not wanted for that purpo&s;e, and was u&s;eful on tho&s;e occa&s;ions which had been &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="146" REF="034483_0144_0FFDE98511C55100">
require the &s;uperintendance of a tru&s;ty per&s;on. Our friend <HI>Servan,</HI> lately appointed mini&s;ter at war, was alarmed at the complication and derangement of certain branches of his department, and envied us Pache. 'Let me have that hone&s;t man,' &s;aid he to Roland: 'you have no further oc|ca&s;ion for him, you are above your bu&s;ine&s;s a hundred times over; and now that the chaos of the fir&s;t out&s;et has a&s;&s;umed &s;hape and order, you no longer need the &s;uperin|tendance of another; but as to me, I am overwhelmed with bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the utmo&s;t want of per&s;ons in whom I can confide.'&mdash;The&s;e mini&s;ters were al&s;o of opinion, that &s;ome &s;hare of capacity was wanting to fill a place, and that a man ought not to be employed without rea&s;onable grounds to &s;uppo&s;e him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tions. Roland con&s;ented, and Pache, upon being con&s;ult|ed, yielded with as good a grace, on the &s;ame conditions that he had made with Roland. After his being thrown into this &s;ituation, we &s;carcely ever &s;aw him; but Servan &s;poke highly in his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>A CHANGE in the mini&s;try took place. Roland kept him&s;elf &s;ecluded from the world; and Pache returned to his &s;ection. The tenth of Augu&s;t followed &s;oon af|ter; and the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly recalled the patriotic mini&s;ters. Roland arranged his offices; and as Pache per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to retain his independence, Ro|land appointed F&eacute;poul, whom Pache had introduced; an intelligent, indu&s;trious, and careful man, very well calculated for the accomptant department, dexterous in his conduct, never &s;etting him&s;elf up in oppo|&s;ition to any one, and ever adhering to the &s;tronge&s;t party.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="034483_0145_0FFDE98949F2F388">ROLAND, elected a member of the convention, and di&s;gu&s;ted at the horrors of September, was de&s;irous of re|tiring from the mini&s;try; and, knowing the extreme em|barra&s;&s;ment the wi&s;e&s;t heads would have been in to find him a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, thought he &s;hould render an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the public by mentioning Pache. This he did with all the frankne&s;s that belonged to his character, and all the warmth of a feeling heart, proud of acknowledging merit, wherever it &s;eems to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>PACHE, to whom he had not hinted his intention, and who had a little before refu&s;ed the &s;uperintendance of the jewel office, a place for which he propo&s;ed <HI>Re&s;tout,</HI> whom Roland appointed upon his recommendation, appeared well &s;atisfied to remain his own ma&s;ter. He accepted, how|ever, a mi&s;&s;ion from Monge for Toulon, repaired thither, and committed &s;everal acts of folly, as I was afterwards in|formed.</P>
<P>SERVAN's health obliging him to quit the war-office, the man whom Roland had recommended was appointed to fill that department, as the per&s;on on whom in point of principle the &s;tronge&s;t dependance might be placed, and who, as to talents, could not but be &s;ufficiently qualified for &s;uch a place. We wrote to Pache, to inform him of his appointment, and pre&s;&s;ed him to accept it. But this was in all likelihood unnece&s;&s;ary; for, jealous as he was of his independence, he appeared not to have the lea&s;t un|ea&s;ine&s;s concerning the burden about to be laid on his &s;houl|ders, and took it up without he&s;itation. On his return to Paris he came to &s;ee us, and we talked with him freely on the di&s;po&s;ition of men's minds; of the party which the Pari&s;ian deputies were forming; of the enormities of the
<PB N="148" REF="034483_0146_0FFDE9869EC624B0">
commune; of the dangers that appeared to threaten the liberty of the convention, and particularly of tho&s;e, which might ari&s;e from the predominance of immoral and guilty men, who only &s;ought to acquire power in order to e&s;cape puni&s;hment or to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions; of the order to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in his department, and of our joy at &s;eeing him in the council, where his pre&s;ence would pre&s;erve a union of will and &s;inglene&s;s of action. Pache li&s;tened to the effu&s;i|ons of confidence with the &s;ilence of a man who conceals his own &s;entiments; oppo&s;ed every opinion of Roland at the council-table; and came to &s;ee him no more.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t we imagined, that this conduct aro&s;e from a movement of &s;elf-love, a &s;ort of &s;ear of appearing the creature of Roland. But I learnt, that this man, who never accepted the invitations of his colleague, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r pretence of the retirement in which the multi|plicity of his bu&s;ine&s;s obliged him to live, received Fabre, Chabot, and other mountaineers at his table; that he paid his court to their friends; that he took their creatures into office, all of them, either as great knaves as the valet in a comedy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the old French comedies, the lackey is invariably a knavi&s;h buffoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who &s;ticks at nothing. <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, or ignorant fellows, or in|triguers like them&s;elves; and that hone&s;t men began to murmur and de&s;pair. I thought it right to try the only means that remained of opening his eyes, if he were merely mi&s;led, or of pulling away the ma&s;k if he were really acting with ill faith. I wrote to him then on the 11th of November, in a friendly &s;tyle, to commu|nicate to him the murmurs that began to prevail, the cau&s;es to which they were owing, and what his own in|tere&s;t
<PB N="149" REF="034483_0147_0FFDE9B1AF4FC548">
&s;eemed to require. I reminded him of what had been &s;aid in confidence on his entrance into the mini&s;try; and I added a word or two concerning the unequivocal &s;en|timents we had expre&s;&s;ed, the unanimity they promi&s;ed, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, &s;o oppo&s;ite to what they would have led one to expect.</P>
<P>PACHE made me not the &s;malle&s;t an&s;wer; and we &s;oon after heard that his fir&s;t clerks Ha&s;&s;enfratz, Vincent, and the re&s;t (mi&s;erable beings, whom I would not mention, had not their enormities already in&s;ured their names a place in the hi&s;tory of the popular commotions of the&s;e latter times) were declaiming at the jacobins, and el&s;ewhere again&s;t Roland, and holding him up as the enemy of the people. There could no longer then be any doubt but that Pache was &s;eeking his downfall. The atrocity and ba&s;ene&s;s of this conduct filled me with indignation and contempt: &s;entiments, in which I was beforehand with &s;e|veral who had become acquainted with Pache by means of us, and who were then inclined to charge me with le|vity, though their aver&s;ion to the man has &s;ince exceeded mine. The peculation, or the profu&s;e expenditure at lea&s;t, that took place in the war department during his admini&s;tration, was horrible; every thing was di&s;organ|i&s;ed, owing to the bad choice of the per&s;ons employed; it was proved, that regiments reduced to a &s;mall num|ber of men were paid as if complete; it was not only impo&s;&s;ible to furni&s;h an account, but even to imagine the means of doing &s;o, for more than 130 millions of livres [near five millions and a half &s;terling]. In the twenty-four hours that followed his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, rendered indi&s;pen&s;able by &s;o much mi&s;chief, he filled up &s;ixty dif|ferent places, with all the per&s;ons he knew of who were
<PB N="150" REF="034483_0148_0FFDE9B341E20E40">
ba&s;e enough to pay their court to him, from his &s;on-in-law, who from a curate became commi&s;&s;ary-general with a &s;alary of 19,000 livres [&pound;. 792], to his hair-dre&s;&s;er, a black|guard boy of nineteen, whom he made a mu&s;ter-ma&s;ter. The&s;e are the exploits which the people of Paris rewarded by calling him to the mayoralty, where, &s;upported by the Chaumets, Heberts, and other tatterdemalions, he favour|ed the oppre&s;&s;ion of the legi&s;lative body, the violation of the national repre&s;entation, and the pro&s;cription of all virtuous men, and thus helped to &s;eal the ruin of his country.</P>
<P>AND this was the man who was in &s;earch of a free country, who gave up pen&s;ions, and refu&s;ed a place! But Pache went into Switzerland, where his family originally re&s;ided&mdash;(a circum&s;tance that enabled his father to keep a great man's door at Paris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reputation of the Swi&s;s for probity was &s;o great in France, that all the noblemen had them in their &s;ervice as porters.

This was a part of his hi&s;tory, which I was unacquainted with, and which is no way in|con&s;i&s;tent with Pache returning to France after the tak|ing of the Ba&s;tile, currying favour in a little popular &s;ociety well contrived for the acqui&s;ition of influence, ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing &s;econd-rate places, but not he&s;itating a moment to become a member of the council, and

<P>WHILST I am writing this, Biron is confined in the pri&s;on that I inhabit. Towards the end of Pache's mi|ni&s;try, Biron came to denounce him to the a&s;&s;embly, and was con&s;equently provided with documents capable of proving his mi&s;demeanours. Biron met with him; was &s;educed by his air of &s;implicity; per&s;uaded him&s;elf that he had erred rather from un&s;kilfulne&s;s than di&s;hone&s;ty; thought it cruel to bring a man to the block who might have been deceived; relinqui&s;hed his de&s;ign; and then mentioned it to Pache him&s;elf. Pache came to an explanation; contriv|ed to wheedle Biron out of all the information and docu|ments that related to the complaint of which he was the object; and then had him &s;ent to the army of Italy, where he was left de&s;titute of every thing. Biron obtained &s;ome advantages; they were never mentioned; he made com|plaints; no attention was paid to them: time ran on; the evils increa&s;ed: he grew urgent: an order was &s;ent him to repair to Paris: as &s;oon as he arrived he was taken into cu&s;tody, and confined at St. P&eacute;lagie. In this &s;troke he re|cognizes the hand of Pache, and has no doubt as to the the tyrant by whom he is oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>LOVE each other, probably becau&s;e there is no re&s;em|&s;emblance between them. Guadet is as impetuous as Gen|&s;onn&eacute; is cool: but the violent &s;allies of his fiery temper are never &s;ucceeded by malice; nor is his &s;oul &s;u&s;ceptible of an intention to offend. Nature has made Guadet an orator; Gen&s;onn&eacute; has made him&s;elf a logician. The one frequently lo&s;es, in deliberating, the time which &s;hould be employed in action: the other di&s;&s;ipates, in bold, but &s;hort and tran&s;ient, flights, that warmth, which ought &s;ometimes to be concentrated, and always to be longer &s;up|ported, in order to produce a durable effect.</P>
<P>GUADET had brilliant moments in each of the two a&s;&s;emblies, the legi&s;lative and conventional: they were owing to the a&s;cendancy of hone&s;ty, &s;econded by ta|lents: but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of feelings too &s;trong to keep up a long &s;truggle without tiring, he has drawn upon him|&s;elf the hatred of the wicked, without exciting much of their fear; nor did he ever attain the degree of influ|ence which his enemies were fond of a&s;cribing to him, in order to render him an object of di&s;tru&s;t. Gen&s;onn&eacute;, u&s;eful in debate, which, however, he has the fault of drawing out to too great a length, took an active part in the committees, and drew up part of the plan of the intended con&s;titution. His &s;peech on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the king is enlivened by &s;arca&s;tic &s;trokes, to which

<P>IN the cour&s;e of July, 1792, the conduct and di&s;po&s;i|tion of the court indicating ho&s;tile de&s;igns, every one talked of the means of preventing or fru&s;trating their execution. On this &s;ubject Chabot &s;aid, with that ardour which proceeds from a heated imagination, and not from &s;trength of mind, that it was to be wi&s;hed that the court might attempt the lives of &s;ome of the patriotic members, as it would infallibly cau&s;e an in&s;urrection of the people, the only mean of &s;etting the multitude in motion, and producing a &s;alutary cri&s;is. He grew warm on this head, on which he made a copious comment. Gran|geneuve, who had li&s;tened to him without &s;aying a word in the little &s;ociety where the di&s;cour&s;e took place, embraced the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;peaking with Chabot in private. 'I have been &s;truck with your rea&s;ons,' &s;aid he: 'they are excellent: but the court is too cunning ever to afford us &s;uch an expedient. We mu&s;t make it for our&s;elves. Find you but men to &s;trike the blow; and I will devote my&s;elf as the victim.'&mdash;'What! you will * * * *?'&mdash;'Certainly. What is there &s;o wonderful in that? My life is of no great utility: my per&s;on of little account: I &s;hall feel the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in offering my&s;elf up as a &s;acrifice for my country's good.'&mdash;'Ah, my friend, you &s;hall
<PB N="155" REF="034483_0153_0FFDE9C1F39E8DC8">
not fall alone:' exclaimed Chabot, with a look of enthu&s;i|a&s;m: 'I am determined to &s;hare the glory with you.'&mdash; 'As you plea&s;e: <HI>one</HI> is enough: <HI>two</HI> may be better. But there will be no glory in the bu&s;ine&s;s; for it is nece&s;&s;ary that it remain a &s;ecret to all the world. Let us then devi&s;e the means of execution.'</P>
<P>CHABOT undertook to provide them; and a few days after informed Grangeneuve, that he had found fit in&s;tru|ments for the purpo&s;e, and that every thing was prepared. &mdash;'Very well: let us appoint the time. We will repair to the committee to-morrow evening; I will leave it at half after ten: we mu&s;t go through &s;ome unfrequented &s;treet, in which you will take care to have your people po&s;ted. But let them mind what they are about. It is their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hoot us properly, and not to make us cripples for life.' &mdash;The hour was fixed, and every thing was agreed upon. Grangeneuve went to make his will, and arrange &s;ome dome&s;tic concerns, without any bu&s;tle; and was punc|tual to the appointment. Chabot did not make his appear|ance. The hour elap&s;ed, and no Chabot came; whence Grangeneuve concluded he had given up his de&s;ign of par|ticipation; but &s;uppo&s;ing that the project held good as to him&s;elf, he &s;et off, took the road agreed on, walked with mea&s;ured &s;teps, met nobody on his way, walked back again, for fear of any mi&s;take, and was obliged to return home &s;afe and &s;ound, much di&s;plea&s;ed at having made all his preparations in vain. Chabot &s;aved him&s;elf from re|proach by &s;ome paltry excu&s;e, taking good care not to de|part from the u&s;ual poltroonery of a prie&s;t, or the hypocri|&s;y of a capuchin friar.</P>

<HEAD>BARBAROUX,</HEAD>
<P>WHOSE features no painter would di&s;dain to copy for the head of an Antinous, active, laborious, ingenu|ous, and brave, with the fiery &s;pirit of a youthful Mar|&s;eillois, was de&s;tined to become a man of merit, and a citizen, equally u&s;eful and enlightened. Enamoured of independence, proud of the revolution, rich in acquired talents, capable of a&s;&s;iduous attention, habituated to ap|plication, and thir&s;ting after fame; he is one of tho&s;e men, whom a great politician would &s;eek to attach to him&s;elf, and who was made to flouri&s;h and di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in a happy republic. But who can venture to &s;ay, to what a degree inju&s;tice, pro&s;cription, and misfor|tune, may repre&s;s the generous efforts of &s;uch a mind, and how far it may tarni&s;h its good qualities? Moderate &s;ucce&s;s would have encouraged Barbaroux in his career, becau&s;e he is fond of fame, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every qualification ne|ce&s;&s;ary to procure him reputation: but the love of plea&s;ure is at hand&punc; and if once it take the place of glory, in con|&s;equence of di&s;appointment or di&s;gu&s;t, it will deba&s;e an excellent temper, and turn him a&s;ide from his noble&s;t de&s;tination.</P>
<P>DURING Roland's fir&s;t admini&s;tration, I had an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing &s;everal letters from Barbaroux, addre&s;&s;ed rather to the man than to the mini&s;ter, and intended to enable him to judge of the means it would be proper to employ, in order to keep ardent and irritable minds, like tho&s;e of the department of the mouths of the Rhone, in the paths of duty. Roland, a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the law, and like the law &s;evere and inflexible, was incapable of
<PB N="157" REF="034483_0155_0FFDE9C748023F48">
&s;peaking more than one language, when charged with its execution. The admini&s;trators had gone a little a&s;tray: the mini&s;ter had chidden them with &s;everity; and their minds were irritated. It was then that Barbaroux wrote to Roland, to vindicate the purity of his countrymen's in|tentions, excu&s;e their errors, and to make Roland under|&s;tand, that gentler methods would bring them back to &s;ubordination with greater &s;peed and effect. The&s;e letters were dictated by the be&s;t intentions, and by &s;uch con|&s;ummate prudence, that when I &s;aw their author, I was a&s;toni&s;hed at his youth. They had the effect they could not fail to have upon an equitable man, who &s;ought only to do good: Roland laid a&s;ide a little of his au&s;terity, a&s;&s;um|ed a tone rather brotherly than mini&s;terial, brought the Mar|&s;eillois back to their duty, and gave Barbaroux his e&s;teem.</P>
<P>AFTER Roland quitted the mini&s;try, we &s;aw him more frequently. His open di&s;po&s;ition and ardent patrioti&s;m in&s;pired us with confidence. It was then, that, rea&s;oning on the bad &s;tate of affairs, and on the danger of &s;eeing de&s;poti&s;m revive in the north, we formed the conditional project of a republic in the &s;outh.&mdash;'That will be our la&s;t &s;take,' &s;aid Barbaroux with a &s;mile: 'but the Mar&s;eil|lois who are here will prevent our recurring to &s;uch an ex|pedient.&mdash;From that &s;peech, and &s;ome others of a like tendency, we conjectured, an in&s;urrection was in agitation; but as his confidence did not lead him to be more com|municative, we a&s;ked him no que&s;tions about the matter. Towards the latter end of July, he almo&s;t entirely di&s;con|tinued his vi&s;its; telling us, the la&s;t time he called, it would be wrong to judge of his &s;entiments in regard to us from any pre&s;umption furni&s;hed by his ab&s;ence, as it was merely

But it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him to labour if he would become an orator.</P>
<P>THE lively and affectionate Barbaroux is attached to the delicate and &s;u&s;ceptible Buzot: I u&s;ed to call them Ny&s;us and Euryalus. May they meet with a better fate than tho&s;e two friends! Louvet, more acute than Barba|roux, more gay than Buzot, and in goodne&s;s of heart equal to either, is intimate with both; but more particularly with the latter, who &s;erves as a link to connect him with Barbaroux, of whom Buzot's natural gravity makes him in &s;ome &s;ort the Mentor.</P>

<P>A POLANDER by birth, came to France no one knows how, de&s;titute of all fortune; but being rich in the in|tere&s;t of the duke of Liancourt, either becau&s;e related to &s;ome per&s;on in his &s;ervice, or becau&s;e connected with him in &s;ome other way, Lazow&s;ki obtained the appointment of in&s;pector of manufactures.</P>
<P>IT was one of tho&s;e very inferior offices of admini&s;tra|tion which conferred no authority; of which the &s;alary was moderate, and the duties &s;uch as to require nothing
<PB N="161" REF="034483_0159_0FFDE9D2017D35D8">
but hone&s;ty, and a certain &s;hare of merit; which con&s;e|quently &s;eemed to &s;uit every body, or for which every one at lea&s;t thought him&s;elf fit. Tho&s;e places were in the gift of the king's council, on the pre&s;entation of the mini&s;ter of the finances, and were &s;ubordinate to the &s;uperintendants of trade, petty magi&s;trates of mighty preten&s;ions, who give them&s;elves great airs of impor|tance; who like many others obtained credit from the public on their own report; and who in reality, from multitude of affairs that came before them, had exten|&s;ive connections, and gave audiences, at which, &s;ome|times, men of the fir&s;t rank did not di&s;dain to attend.</P>
<P>LIVELY, enterpri&s;ing, and pa&s;&s;ing him&s;elf off for a man of under&s;tanding, Lazow&s;ki had per&s;uaded his pa|tron, that it was not fitting for &s;uch a man to remain a &s;imple in&s;pector of manufactures. It is true, that, in order to find him employment, an in&s;pector&s;hip had been created at Soi&s;&s;ons, where there was &s;carcely any manu|facture but of prie&s;ts, and &s;carcely any objects of in&s;pec|tion except nuns; for it was a town as full of convents as deficient in indu&s;try, and de&s;titute of all commerce but that of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries of life. Mr. de Liancourt, who was led to de&s;ire the promotion of his dependant by the vanity common among courtiers, was further impelled by the native excellence of his heart. He was pre&s;&s;ing with the mini&s;ter, and &s;till more &s;o with the &s;u|perintendants of commerce; for the &s;econdary agents are always the really effective men. Calonne was compt|roller-general: he had an inventive mind, and was ready at taking up ingenious ideas. The creation of a travel|ling in&s;pector&s;hip was devi&s;ed. That was no effort of
<PB N="162" REF="034483_0160_0FFDE9D4A8E62B48">
genius, &s;ince &s;uch a place had already exi&s;ted, and its in|utility had been acknowledged: but it will readily be admitted, that the &s;econd creation was not without a mo|tive, &s;ince it afforded the means of obliging a man of con&s;equence, while the number of places, which amount|ed to four, gave the operation &s;omething of the appear|ance of an affair of &s;tate, to &s;ay nothing of the advantage of three places remaining for favour and intrigue. They were &s;oon filled. Salaries of 8000 livres [333l. 6s. 8d.] a year were given them; a re&s;idence in Paris four months out of twelve; excur&s;ions through the provinces during the remaining eight; the right of &s;ucceeding the in&s;pectors-general on their decea&s;e, and permi&s;&s;ion to &s;olicit gratifications in proportion to the length of their journies and the importance of their &s;ervices. It is true, that this &s;apped the foundation of an in&s;titution, the &s;pirit of which was excellent. It deprived the in&s;pectors of the generalities of the hope of arriving at the in&s;pector-general&s;hip by merit or &s;eniority: it di&s;couraged them, by &s;ending into their re&s;pective departments men for the mo&s;t part &s;trangers to the bu&s;ine&s;s: and it deprived the mini&s;ter of the po&s;&s;ibility of being well-informed of the &s;tate of arts, manufactures, and commerce; and in &s;hort of all the objects of indu&s;try; of which it was natural to expect a much better account from men &s;ettled in the &s;everal generalities for that purpo&s;e, than from the&s;e birds of pa&s;&s;age, employed in running over them all. But the views of the old government did not extend &s;o far: and who knows whether the individuals who com|po&s;e the new, are of a more capacious mind, or more di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="034483_0161_0FFDE9D75759B8E0">THIS happened in the &s;pring of 1784, when I was brought to Paris by family affairs.

I reflected, that Roland was always looking forward to his retirement, and intended to a&s;k for it, as &s;oon as he &s;hould fini&s;h his labours in the Encyclopedia, that he might go into his own country, forget Paris, and the meanne&s;&s;es to which a man mu&s;t &s;toop for the preferment that was refu&s;ed to merit. I thought it would be better for him to go home with a place, than without one; and it occured to me, to &s;olicit the exchange of that of Amiens, where we then were, for that of Lyons, which would fix him in his own country. This trifling favour I &s;up|po&s;ed would be readily granted to an old &s;ervant, who&s;e knowledge, and who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition e&s;pecially, the &s;uper|intendants of commerce dreaded enough to be plea&s;ed with his removal. The commi&s;&s;ions were already made out.

The 17th of July, on my return from the Jaco|bins, where I had been witne&s;s to the agitation produced by the mournful events of the Champ-de-Mars, whom &s;hould I find at home, at eleven at night, but M. and madam Robert.&mdash;'We are come,' &s;aid the wife to me, with all the confidence of an old friend, 'to a&s;k you for an a&s;ylum. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to be often in your company, to form a favourable opinion of your patrioti&s;m, and of the goodne&s;s of your heart: my hu&s;band was drawing up the petition on the national altar, and I was by his &s;ide: we have e&s;caped the &s;laughter, and dare not take refuge in our own hou&s;e, nor in that of any known friend, where &s;earch may be made for us'&mdash;'I am much obliged to you,' replied I, 'for having thought of me on &s;o lamentable an occa&s;ion, and am proud of affording a &s;helter to the per&s;ecuted: but you will be badly conceal|ed here:' I was then at the <HI>Hotel Brittannique, Rue Guenegaud)</HI> 'this hou&s;e is much frequented, and the land|lord is a great parti&s;an of Lafayette.'&mdash;'It is only for to-night: to-morrow we will think of a retreat.'</P>
<P>I SENT to inform the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hotel, that a kin&s;|woman of mine having arrived at Paris at the very mo|ment of tumult, had left her baggage at the coach-office, and would pa&s;s the night with me; and that I therefore reque&s;ted her to make up a couple of field-beds in my apartment. They were accordingly &s;pread in a parlour, and there our hu&s;bands lay, while madame Robert &s;lept in my hu&s;bands bed, by the &s;ide of mine, in my own room. The next morning, I ro&s;e early, and ha&s;tened to
<PB N="168" REF="034483_0166_0FFDE9E4EE3B9A10">
write letters, to my di&s;tant friends, to inform them of the events of the preceding evening. M. and madame Robert, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be very active, and as jour|nali&s;ts, to have a much more exten&s;ive corre&s;pondence than my&s;elf, dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves very cooly, &s;at chatting, after the breakfa&s;t I had ordered for them, and placed them&s;elves in the balcony facing the &s;treet. They even went &s;o far as to call up a per&s;on of their acquaintance who was pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>THIS conduct appeared to me very incon&s;i&s;tent in peo|ple who were hiding them&s;elves. The per&s;on, whom they had called up, entered into earne&s;t conver&s;ation with them concerning the events of the day before; boa&s;ted that he had run his &s;word through the body of a national guard; and talked very loudly, though in a room adjoining to a large anti-chamber common to my apartment and to another.</P>
<P>I CALLED madam Robert.&mdash;'I received you, madam, with that intere&s;t, which ju&s;tice and compa&s;&s;ion for wor|thy people in danger naturally in&s;pire; but I cannot give an a&s;ylum to all your acquaintance. You expo&s;e your|&s;elf by conver&s;ing as you do, in a hou&s;e like this with a per&s;on of &s;o little di&s;cretion. I am in the habit of receiving members of the a&s;&s;embly, who might &s;tand a chance of being brought into trouble, if &s;een to en|ter this hotel while it contains a per&s;on who boa&s;ts of having ye&s;terday committed acts of violence. I beg you will de&s;ire him to withdraw.'&mdash;Madam Robert called her hu&s;band; I repeated my ob&s;ervations, in rather a higher tone, becau&s;e it &s;eemed to me that the duller per&s;onage &s;tood in need of a &s;tronger im|pre&s;&s;ion; and the man was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. I learnt that his

I have &s;ince been imformed that he was one of the hawkers of Marat's paper, that he had never learnt to read, and that he is now an admini&s;trator of the department of Paris, where he makes a very good figure among his fellows.</P>
<P>IT was noon; and M. and madam Robert talked of going home, where every thing mu&s;t needs be in confu|&s;ion. I told them, that &s;uch being the ca&s;e, if they would take a dinner with me before they went, I would order it at an early hour. They replied, they would rather return, and engaged them&s;elves accordingly as they were going out of the room. Before three o'clock they made their appearance again in full dre&s;s: the wife had long plumes upon her head and plenty of rouge upon her cheeks; the hu&s;band had put on a &s;uit of &s;ky-blue &s;ilk, with which his black hair, hanging down his &s;houlders in large curls, formed a &s;ingular contra&s;t: a long toledo by his &s;ide, added every thing to his dre&s;s, that could &s;erve to make him remarkable.&mdash;'Why, my god!' &s;aid &s;aid I to my&s;elf: 'are the&s;e people mad?' and I li&s;tened to their di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;atisfy my&s;elf, that their brains were not really turned. The fat and portly Robert ate wonderfully well; and his wife prattled to her heart's
<PB N="170" REF="034483_0168_0FFDE9EA4A725100">
content. At length they took leave, nor did I ever &s;ee them, or &s;peak of them afterwards to any body.</P>
<P>ON our return to Paris the following winter, Robert, meeting Roland at the Jacobins, made him &s;ome civil reproaches, or polite complaints, on account of our hav|ing broken off all intercour&s;e with them; and his wife came &s;everal times to call upon me, inviting me in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner to go to her hou&s;e, where &s;he re|ceived company twice a week, and where I &s;hould be &s;ure to meet with meritorious members of the legi&s;lature. I went once, and there I found Antoine, with who&s;e me|diocrity I was well acquainted, a little man, well enough to put upon a toilette, and a pretty poeta&s;ter writing agreeably upon trifling &s;ubjects, but de&s;titute of every thing like &s;pirit or con&s;i&s;tency. There I found al&s;o &s;ev|eral other members, &s;worn patriots, and &s;everal women of <HI>ardent</HI> civi&s;m, who with &s;ome honourable members of the fraternal &s;ociety, completed a circle which &s;uited me little, and to which I never returned.</P>
<P>A FEW months afterwards Roland was called to the admini&s;tration of public affairs. Four-and-twenty hours had &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed, when I &s;aw madam Robert walk into my apartment.&mdash;So, your hu&s;band is in place: well, as patriots ought to &s;erve one another, I hope you will not forget mine.'&mdash;'I &s;hould be very happy, madam, to render you any &s;ervice; but I do not know how far it may be in my power: M. Roland, however, will no doubt attend to the intere&s;t of the public by employing per&s;ons of capacity. In four days time, madam Robert returned to pay me a morning vi&s;it; and in a few days after, another, always in&s;i&s;ting upon the nece&s;&s;ity of giv|ing
<PB N="171" REF="034483_0169_0FFDE9ED323CAFF0">
her hu&s;band an appointment, and upon his being entitled to one by virtue of his patrioti&s;m. I informed ma|dam Robert, that the mini&s;ter of the home-department had no kind of places in his gift, except tho&s;e in his own of|fice, which were all filled: that notwith&s;tanding the advantages which might accrue from changing &s;ome of his agents, it behoved a prudent man to &s;tudy things and per&s;ons, previous to alterations, le&s;t the progre&s;s of the public bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be impeded; and that, from what &s;he had &s;aid her&s;elf, it did not &s;eem likely her hu&s;band would accept a clerk's place.&mdash;'Certainly Robert is qualified for &s;ome|thing better.'&mdash;'In that ca&s;e, the mini&s;ter of the home-department can do nothing to &s;erve you.'&mdash;'But he can &s;peak to the mini&s;ter of foreign affairs, and get &s;ome mi&s;&s;ion for Robert.'&mdash;'I believe that it is contrary to the &s;trictne&s;s of M. Roland's principles to &s;olicit any thing, or to interfere in the departments of his colleagues: but as you probably mean nothing more than the bear|ing witne&s;s to your hu&s;band's civi&s;m, I will mention it to mine.'</P>
<P>MADAME Robert laid clo&s;e &s;iege to Dumouriez and Bri&s;&s;ot: and three weeks after, returned to tell me, that the former had given her a promi&s;e, which &s;he begged me to remind him of, whenever he might chance to come in my way.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of that week he came to dine with me, Bri&s;&s;ot and &s;everal other per&s;ons being pre&s;ent.&mdash;'Have you not promi&s;ed a certain very pre&s;&s;ing lady,' &s;aid I to Dumouriez, 'to give her hu&s;band a place? She has reque&s;ted me to remind you of it; and
<PB N="172" REF="034483_0170_0FFDE9EFE02B84F8">
&s;o great is her &s;olicitude, that I &s;hall not be &s;orry to be able to quiet her with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, by telling her, that I have done what &s;he de&s;ired.'&mdash;'Is it not Robert you mean?' a&s;ked Bri&s;&s;ot immediately. &mdash;'It is.'&mdash;'Aye!' re&s;umed he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Dumouriez, with his u&s;ual &s;implicity: 'you ought to give that man an appointment. He is a &s;incere friend of the revolution, a &s;trenuous patriot, and not very ea&s;y in his circum&s;tances: the reign of liberty ought to be beneficial to its friends.'&mdash;'What?' &s;aid Dumouriez, in|terrupting him, with great good-humour and vivacity, 'are you &s;peaking of that little black-headed man, as broad as he is long? I have no inclination, faith, to di&s;grace my&s;elf; and &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;end &s;uch a blockhead any where.'&mdash;'But,' replied Bri&s;&s;ot, 'in the number of agents you have occa&s;ion to employ, all do not require equal capacity.'&mdash;'Pray, are you well ac|quainted with this Robert?' &s;aid Dumouriez.&mdash;'I am very well acquainted with Keralio, his wife's father, a man of infinite re&s;pectability, and at his hou&s;e I have &s;een Robert. I know he is accu&s;ed of a few follies; but I believe him to be an hone&s;t man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an excel|lent heart, actuated by the true &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, and &s;tanding in need of employment.'&mdash;'I employ no &s;uch madmen.'&mdash;'But you promi&s;ed his wife?'&mdash;'Certainly: an inferior place, with a &s;alary of a thou&s;and crowns; which he refu&s;ed. Do you know what &s;he a&s;ks? the emba&s;&s;y to Con&s;tantinople.'&mdash;'The emba&s;&s;y to Con|&s;tantinople!' exclaimed Bri&s;&s;ot, with a laugh: 'impo&s;|&s;ible!'&mdash;'It is fact, however.'&mdash;'I have nothing more to &s;ay.'&mdash;'Nor I,' added Dumouriez: 'except, that I
<PB N="173" REF="034483_0171_0FFDE9F3A53AA3C0">
will order that hog&s;head to be rolled into the &s;treet, the next time he comes, and &s;hut my door in his wife's face.'</P>
<P>MADAME Robert returned once more to the charge. I wi&s;hed much to get rid of her without coming to a quarrel, and could find but one way that was con&s;i&s;tent with my natural frankne&s;s. As &s;he complained bitterly of Dumouriez, on account of his tardine&s;s, I told her I had &s;poken to him; and that I thought it incumbent on me to let her know &s;he had enemies, who propagated ill reports concerning her; that I would advi&s;e her to trace them to their &s;ource, and de&s;troy them, in order that a man in a public capacity might not expo&s;e him&s;elf to the detraction of the malevolent, by employing a per|&s;on who was the object of unfavourable prejudices; and that for the above purpo&s;e nothing was wanting but an explanation, which I exhorted her to give. Madame Robert repaired to Bri&s;&s;ot, who ingeniou&s;ly told her, that &s;he had been guilty of great folly in a&s;king for an emba&s;|&s;y, and that people with &s;uch ill-founded preten&s;ions might expect, in the end, to get nothing at all.</P>
<P>WE &s;aw her no more: but her hu&s;band wrote a pam|phlet again&s;t Bri&s;&s;ot, to denounce him as a di&s;tributor of places, and a deceiver, who had promi&s;ed him the em|ba&s;&s;y to Con&s;tantinople, and then forfeited his word. He entered into the club of Cordeliers, courted an ac|quaintance with Danton, &s;ubmitted to be his clerk when the latter became mini&s;ter on the 10th of Augu&s;t, was pu&s;hed by him into the eloctoral body, and into the de|putation from Paris to the convention, paid his debts, lived expen&s;ively, gave entertainments to d'Orleans, and a thou&s;and others, is now rich, culumniates Roland,

<HEAD>CHAMPFORT AND CARRA.</HEAD>
<P>CHAMPFORT, a man of letters, living in the fa&s;hona|able world, familiar with the great people of the old government, and connected with men of talents who have made a figure in the revolution, is acquainted with the court and the city, with characters and intrigues, with politics and mankind, &s;till better than the age in which he lives.</P>
<P>CHAMPFORT partook of that extreme confidence, with which I have always reproached the philo&s;ophers who have acted a part in the new order of things. He could not believe in the a&s;cendancy of a few wrong-headed fellows, nor in the confu&s;ion they would find means to create.&mdash;'You carry things to an extreme,' he would &s;ay to me &s;ometimes: 'becau&s;e, placed in the centre of movement, you &s;uppo&s;e its &s;phere of action exten&s;ive. It appears to you to be violent; and you therefore con&s;ider it as formidable. The&s;e fellows will ruin them&s;elves by their own intemperance: they will never be able to extingui&s;h the light of eighteen centu|ries.'&mdash;<HI>The&s;e fellows</HI> rule however; and Champfort is now a pri&s;oner, with all tho&s;e who will not idolize their power.</P>
<P>A GREAT &s;tock of wit, a tolerable portion of morality, the graces of good breeding, the acquirements of litera|ture, and the philo&s;ophy of a &s;ound and cultivated un|der&s;tanding, rendered Champfort's conver&s;ation equally &s;olid and entertaining. At fir&s;t I thought he talked too
<PB N="175" REF="034483_0173_0FFDE9F812795EC0">
much; and I accu&s;ed him of that exuberance of &s;peech, and that &s;ort of preponderance, which our men of letters very commonly a&s;&s;ume. I liked him better in a &s;elect &s;ociety of five or &s;ix per&s;ons, than in a mixed company of fifteen or twenty, of which I had to do the honours. But after all, I could not help forgiving him for &s;peaking more than any body el&s;e, becau&s;e he afforded me more amu&s;ement: he abounds in tho&s;e happy &s;allies, which produce the rare effect of making you laugh and think at the &s;ame time.&mdash;'Do you believe Champfort to be a thoroughly &s;incere patriot?' &s;aid, one day, a man of more than Spartan au&s;terity.&mdash;'Let us not mi&s;under&s;tand one another,' replied I. 'Champfort's views are good, and his judgment excellent: he has a &s;ound under&s;tand|ing, and is never wrong as to principles: he acknow|ledges and reveres tho&s;e of public freedom, and human happine&s;s, nor will he betray them. But would he &s;a|crifice to them his peace, his enjoyments, and his life? That, indeed, is quite a different que&s;tion; on which, I believe, he would take time to deliberate.'&mdash;'It is plain then that he is not a virtuous man.'&mdash;'Why he is vir|tuous, as Ninna was cha&s;te: and amid&s;t the corruption which preys on our vitals, it would be lucky for us if we had many &s;uch virtuous men.'&mdash;Our hypocrites and enthu&s;ia&s;ts could never be brought to under&s;tand that men &s;hould be employed according to the compound ratio of their talents and civi&s;m, &s;o that they &s;hould be intere&s;ted in employing the former to the advantage of the latter. I have &s;een Servan in a rage for finding ex|cellent engineers, whom he had employed in the camp near Paris, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of their not being

ardent republicans, while &s;turdy patriots, &s;o completely ignorant as not to know how to draw a line, were put in their place.&mdash;'I would not &s;end for them,' &s;aid he very ju&s;tly, 'to give their opinions on a form of go|vernment: but I am convinced they will &s;erve <HI>him</HI> well who knows how to employ them. We are in want of <HI>redoubts,</HI> and not of <HI>motions.</HI>'&mdash;That was being too ra|tional: it was talking like the <HI>faction of &s;tate&s;men;</HI> and thus it was, men of intellect acquired the title of <HI>con|&s;pirators.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN Roland was recalled to the mini&s;try on the 10th of Augu&s;t, it was nece&s;&s;ary to change the director of the national library. That place was held by one <HI>d'Orme&s;&s;on,</HI> who&s;e name gave umbrage to the new government, and who&s;e mediocrity left no room for regret. The mini&s;ter of the home department thought of dividing the duties of librarian between two per&s;ons; of reducing the &s;alary from twelve thou&s;and livres [&pound;.500] a year to eight [333l. 6s. 8d.]; and of making it a rule to have the library open every day; &s;o that the public would be a gainer, on the &s;core of in&s;truction; the nation, on that of oeconomy; and the government, by the employ|ment of two u&s;eful men. In the choice of per&s;ons, he fixed on Champfort, who, as man of letters and a phi|lo&s;opher, had openly declared for the revolution; and on Carra, already employed in the library, who&s;e extreme zeal, if not his talents, &s;eemed to entitle him to that re|ward. He had never &s;een either of them, and was determined &s;olely by tho&s;e con&s;iderations, to which was &s;uperadded, the nece&s;&s;ity of making a choice agreeable to the public. I recei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e vi&s;its of both of them, in

con&s;equence of their appointment, and their nece&s;&s;ary intercour&s;e with the mini&s;ter of the home department; and I &s;hould have continued to &s;ee Champfort with plea|&s;ure, if circum&s;tances had not kept us at a di&s;tance from each other.</P>
<P>CARRA, when he became a deputy, appeared to me a very good kind of man, with a very indifferent head. It is impo&s;&s;ible to be more enthu&s;ia&s;tic in favour of the rev|olution, liberty, and a commonwealth; or a wor&s;e judge of men and things. Giving way entirely to his imagi|nation; making his calculations accordingly, in&s;tead of grounding them upon facts; arranging in his mind the intere&s;ts of foreign powers in the way that be&s;t &s;uited our &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;eeing every thing in the mo&s;t flattering point of view, he talked of his country's happine&s;s, and the emancipation of all Europe, with inexpre&s;&s;ible com|placency. It cannot be denied, that he contributed greatly to our political commotions, and to the in&s;ur|rections of which the object was the overthrow of tyran|ny. His <HI>Annals</HI> &s;ucceeded wonderfully with the popu|lace, by means of a certain prophetic &s;tyle, which always has weight with the vulgar. When we behold &s;uch a man brought to trial, as a traitor to the republic, we are tempted to a&s;k whether Robe&s;pierre be not doing the work of Au&s;tria. But it is evident that he is labouring for him&s;elf; and that, in his in&s;atiate ambition to pa&s;s for the &s;ole deliverer of France, he would wi&s;h to annihi|late all tho&s;e who have gained any thing like fame or reputation in the &s;ervice of their country.</P>

<HEAD>DORAT-CUBIERES</HEAD>
<P>Is a name I had &s;o often &s;een in the <HI>Almanac of the Mu&s;es,</HI> and other compilations of equal importance, that I could not help laughing, when I found it connected with the title of &s;ecretary-regi&s;ter of the municipality. It &s;eemed an ab&s;urdity; and &s;o indeed it was. Cubi&egrave;res, faithful to that double character of in&s;olence and ba&s;ene&s;s, which his forbidding countenance wears in a &s;upreme degree, preaches &s;ans-culoti&s;m as he hailed the graces, writes ver&s;es upon Marat as he did upon Iris, and &s;an|guinary, as he was before apparenly amorous, without feeling any impul&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, he pro&s;trates him&s;elf humbly before the idol of the day, be it Venus or be it Tantalus. Provided he creep through life, and get bread what can it &s;ignify how; ye&s;terday it was by writing "a &s;onnet to his mi&s;tre&s;s's eye-brow," to-day it is by copying a report, or &s;igning an order of police.</P>
<P>GETTING, &s;omehow or other, admi&s;&s;ion into my hou&s;e, when my hu&s;band was mini&s;ter, I knew him only as a wit, and had an opportunity of &s;hewing him &s;ome little civility. He dined with me twice: the fir&s;t time I thought him odd; the &s;econd, in&s;upportable: an in&s;ipid &s;ycophant, a ful&s;ome flatterer, &s;tupidly conceited, and meanly polite; he is more at variance with good &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on than any other being I ever &s;aw. I &s;oon felt the nece&s;&s;ity of giving to my open manner that air of &s;olemnity which lets a per&s;on, of whom we wi&s;h to get rid, know what he has to do. Cubi&egrave;res took the hint; but &s;ome time after he wrote to me notwith&s;tanding, to beg permi&s;&s;ion to introduce a prince, who was de&s;irous
<PB N="179" REF="034483_0177_0FFDEA02E5C7D830">
of being admitted to my acquaintance. He dwelt on the title of prince in a manner truly laughable; and added the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting prai&s;es of my per&s;on. I an|&s;wered as I u&s;ually do when I wi&s;h to call people to order without putting them in a pa&s;&s;ion, and to make a je&s;t of them without giving them a right to complain. As to the prince, and his introduction, I contented my|&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that, in the retired life I led, a &s;tran|ger to every thing that might be termed a circle, and avoiding company as much as po&s;&s;ible, I made it a rule to receive only &s;uch per&s;ons as bu&s;ine&s;s, or long habits of friend&s;hip, made my hu&s;band wi&s;h to &s;ee now and then at his table. Cubi&egrave;res &s;ent me in return excu&s;es as tedious as his eulogium, and reque&s;ted a &s;ingle moment to explain him&s;elf at my feet. I made him no an&s;wer, nor did I ever throw away a thought upon him, till the day I was apprehended, when I perceived his &s;ignature to the order of the commune; for there were two: one from the committee of in&s;urrection of the 31&s;t of May, the other from the commune. Both were &s;hewn to me, le&s;t I &s;hould object to that of the committee: and yet the latter was the only one exhibited by my guards to the keeper of the Abbey, whither I was conveyed.</P>
<P>THE reque&s;t of Cubi&egrave;res had led me to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome hidden views of intere&s;t, and I diverted my hu&s;band at the time by a recital of what had pa&s;&s;ed. I learned after|wards, that the prince of Salm-Kirbourg, the per&s;on in que&s;tion, was then importuning the mini&s;ters, in order to obtain from the council an indemnification of &s;ome &s;ort or other for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Al&s;ace. Hence I con|cluded that I had gue&s;&s;ed aright, and that the de&s;ire of
<PB N="180" REF="034483_0178_0FFDEA06AA63E208">
&s;eeing me had ari&s;en &s;olely from an idea that the new &s;y&s;tem might re&s;emble the old, when women were pre|vailed upon to a&s;k favours of their hu&s;bands. I gave my&s;elf credit for my conduct, and found in this anecdote a fre&s;h trait of the character of Cubi&egrave;res. It would be &s;erving him properly to publi&s;h his &s;ervile letters, as contra&s;ts to his affectation of frankne&s;s and a love of li|berty. I &s;hould have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed curious pieces of that &s;ort, if I had pre&s;erved all the tra&s;h I have received. How many relations and admirers, of whom I had never heard before, &s;prang up all at once, when I became the wife of a mini&s;ter!&mdash;As I admitted no company, they wrote to me; and I had quite enough to do to read their letters; which I an&s;wered briefly and politely, but with great frankne&s;s, in order to leave them no room to &s;up|po&s;e that I either could or would interfere in any thing, and to convince them of the perfect inutility of paying me compliments, or calling them&s;elves my relations.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t curious circum&s;tance is, that &s;ome of the&s;e people were angry, and made me very ungracious re|plies. I remember one M. David, who had planned &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment, in favour of which he &s;olicited my in|tere&s;t. It availed me nothing to an&s;wer, that he would accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e by applying directly to the mi|ni&s;ter; that my interference could be of no u&s;e; and that I never employed it, as it would be &s;etting my&s;elf up for a judge of matters quite out of my way: he con|&s;idered my principles as abominable, and wrote to me in a very angry &s;tile.</P>
<P>THUS in private was I per&s;ecuted for my per&s;everance in confining my&s;elf to my own &s;phere; and in public I was
<PB N="181" REF="034483_0179_0FFDEA08365B3CC8">
a&s;&s;ailed by envy, as if I had been governing the &s;tate. And yet people think it very plea&s;ing and de&s;irable to fill places of eminence! No doubt the wife of a good man devoted to the &s;ervice of the public, who is proud of his virtues, and feels her&s;elf capable of &s;upporting his courage, has her gratifications, and derives enjoyment from his glory; but the&s;e plea&s;ures are not obtained gratuitou&s;ly, and few are the people who could pay the price they co&s;t, without regretting the purcha&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTES.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was brought to the Abbey, the family of De&s;illes was &s;till there; but was &s;oon after removed to the Conciergerie, whence &s;everal of the per&s;ons concerned in the con&s;piracy in Brittany were conducted to the &s;caf|fold. Angelica De&s;illes, the wife of Roland de la Fouchais, the &s;imilarity of who&s;e name to mine led one of my friends into &s;ome curious blunders in an attempt to carry me off, was one of the victims. Her &s;i&s;ters were acquitted, and ought con&s;equently to have enjoy|ed their liberty; but, as a mea&s;ure of general &s;afety, they were again taken into cu&s;tody, and conveyed to St. P&eacute;lagi&eacute;. I found them there, and conver&s;ed with them &s;everal times. They were young, amiable, and polite women, the elder of whom, a widow of twenty-&s;even, was neither de&s;titute of per&s;onal charms nor energy of mind; the younger was in a very precarious &s;tate of health. At fir&s;t, overwhelmed with grief, they appeared likely to &s;ink under it: but being both mothers
<PB N="182" REF="034483_0180_0FFDEA0AE6D8BB90">
of helple&s;s children, to whom their exi&s;tence was nece&s;|&s;ary, they called up all their courage.</P>
<P>THEY mentioned to me repeatedly the ba&s;e treachery of Cheftel, a man of wit, well know at Paris, where he practi&s;es phy&s;ic, a Breton by birth, who had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the mo&s;t intimate confidence of their father, was acquainted with his wi&s;hes, and appeared to favour his &s;chemes; but, connected at the &s;ame time with Danton, he received through his means a commi&s;&s;ion from the executive power, repaired to Brittany, to pay court to his friend, took up his abode at his country hou&s;e, received entertainments from his relations, encou|raged his de&s;igns, and gave them fre&s;h activity by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At the moment that appeared mo&s;t conve|nient, he &s;ecretly informed again&s;t him, and &s;ent for per&s;ons who were in waiting to take him into cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>DESILLES e&s;caped. But all his family were apprehend|ed; his effects were &s;ealed up, and a &s;trict &s;earch was made in all the places which might &s;erve to conceal his corre&s;pondence, and which Cheftel had pointed out. The young women, who &s;till thought him a friend to the family, begged his advice, and implicitly followed his directions. Not knowing what to do with a pur&s;e of two hundred louis intended for their father, they put it into his hands, ordered the be&s;t hor&s;e in the &s;table to be &s;addled, and pre&s;&s;ed Cheftel to make his e&s;cape. He made a &s;hew of being determined to &s;hare their fate; accompanied them accordingly, but not as a pri&s;oner; and endeavoured to per&s;uade the commander of the armed force, that had charge of the pri&s;oners, to bring
<PB N="183" REF="034483_0181_0FFDEA0D94A658B0">
them by day into the great towns. 'Surely you are not in earne&s;t,' &s;aid the officer; 'it would endanger their lives'.</P>
<P>THEY arrived at Paris. The trial commenced. The name of Cheftel was era&s;ed from the corre&s;pondence, becau&s;e he had di&s;clo&s;ed the plot; and the poor victims then di&s;covered the &s;erpent they had fo&s;tered in their bo&s;om. Tried, acquitted, detained notwith&s;tanding, and de&s;titute of money, the two young women recollected the pur&s;e of gold. They confided the circum&s;tance to a man of courage and probity, who went to Cheftel, and demanded the two hundred louis. Cheftel, taken by &s;urpri&s;e, at fir&s;t denied the fact: but, terrified at the firmne&s;s of the demander, who threatened to expo&s;e him to the eyes of all the world, he &s;tammered out a confe&s;|&s;ion of the receipt of half that &s;um, and repaid it in a&s;|&s;ignats, but not till after repeated interviews.</P>
<P>CHEFTEL, formerly phy&s;ician to madam Elizabeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The king's &s;i&s;ter. <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, affiduous in pur&s;uit of fortune, had in like manner gained the confidence of a wealthy individual, who&s;e name I believe to be Paganel, or &s;omething like it, and who, among other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, has immen&s;e e&s;tates in Limou&s;in. Paganel, de&s;irous of emigrating, to &s;helter him&s;elf from the &s;torms of the revolution, made a fictitious &s;ale of his property to Cheftel. He &s;et off, and depended upon the income, which was to be remitted to him by his faithful friend; but Cheftel kept it for him&s;elf, and enjoys with Danton the plea&s;ures of an opulence, which both have acquired by &s;imilar means.</P>
<P>AT length repeated &s;olicitations, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, perhaps, by more prevailing arguments, procured the two &s;i&s;ters their
<PB N="184" REF="034483_0182_0FFDEA115D730448">
liberty. I &s;aw them depart: but I did not know their &s;ecret on that head. I have ju&s;t &s;een Ca&s;tellane, how|ever, purcha&s;e his enlargement, at the price of thirty thou&s;and livers [&pound;.1250], paid to Chabot. Dillon got out of the Magdelonettes in the &s;ame manner. Both were involved in the charge of a counter-revolutionary plot. This very moment, Augu&s;t 22, I have before my eyes a certain Mademoi&s;elle Briant, a kept girl, who lives at No. 207, <HI>Cloitre Saint-Benoit,</HI> and who&s;e keeper is a forger of a&s;&s;ignats. Having been informed again&s;t, apparent endeavours were made to apprehend him; but a &s;hower of gold poured into the hands of the admini|&s;trators. The man who &s;ends out the armed force em|ployed to &s;eek and take him into cu&s;tody, knows where he is concealed; his mi&s;tre&s;s is apprehend for form's &s;ake; the admini&s;trators, who appear to come in order to examine her, bring her accounts of her keeper; and very &s;oon they will both enjoy their liberty, &s;ince they have wherewithal to pay for it.</P>
<P>FOUQIER-TAINVILLE, public accu&s;er to the revolutionary tribunal, notorious for his di&s;&s;olute life and impudence in drawing up articles of impeachment without cau&s;e, is in the habit of receiving money from the per&s;ons accu&s;ed. Madam Rochechouart paid him eighty thou&s;and livres [&pound;.3333] for Mony the emigrant. Fouqier-Tainville pocketed the &s;um; Mony was executed; and madam Rochechouart was given to under&s;tand that, if &s;he &s;aid a word about the matter, &s;he would be in&s;tantly immured never more to behold the face of day. Is it po&s;&s;ible? the reader will exclaim.&mdash;Well! hear more. In the hands of a late pre&s;ident of the department of the Eure

two letters exi&s;t, from Lacroix the deputy, formerly judge-fi&s;cal of Anet. One contains an engagement for five hundred thou&s;and livers [&pound;.20833], to be applied to the purcha&s;e of national domains: the other is to with|draw the engagement, and &s;top the purcha&s;e, in con&s;e|quence of the decree which obliges members of the con|vention to account for any increa&s;e of their fortune &s;ince the revolution. But this decree has been laid a&s;leep &s;ince the trouble&s;ome twenty-two were expelled; and Lacroix po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es e&s;tates as well as Danton, after having pillaged in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>A DUTCHMAN went lately to the commune of Paris, for a pa&s;&s;port to enable him to return to his own coun|try. It was refu&s;ed. The Dutchman made no com|plaint; but, &s;eeing which way the wind blew, took out his pocket-book, and laid an a&s;&s;ignat of a hundred crowns upon the de&s;k. The language was well under&s;tood, and he received his pa&s;&s;port.</P>
<P>HERE Marat will be quoted to me, in who&s;e hou&s;e, at his decea&s;e, according to the public papers, no more than a &s;ingle a&s;&s;ignat of twenty-five &s;ols [1s. 0d. &frac12;] was found. What edifying poverty! Let us, however, ca&s;t an eye on his lodgings: it is a lady who is going to de&s;cribe them. Her hu&s;band, a member of the revolutionary tribunal, is confined in the pri&s;on of La Force, for differ|ing in opinion from the ruling powers; and &s;he has been &s;ent to St. P&eacute;lagie, as a mea&s;ure of &s;afety, it is &s;aid; but probably becau&s;e the active &s;olicitations of this active lit|tle woman from the &s;outh were dreaded. She is a native of Toulou&s;e, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the vivacity of the ardent cli|mate under which &s;he fir&s;t drew breath. Being &s;trongly
<PB N="186" REF="034483_0184_0FFDEA147856CE48">
attached to a hand&s;ome cou&s;in, &s;he was rendered quite di&s;con&s;olate by his apprehen&s;ion, which took place a few months ago. She had given her&s;elf much pains to no purpo&s;e, and knew not to whom to apply, when &s;he thought of trying the effect of a vi&s;it to Marat. She a&s;ked to &s;peak to him, and was told he was not at home: but he heard a female voice, and came out of his own accord. He had boots on, without &s;tockings, an old pair of leather breeches, and a white &s;ilk wai&s;tcoat. His dirty &s;hirt, open at the bo&s;om, exhibited his &s;kin of yellow hue; while his long and dirty nails di&s;played them&s;elves at his fingers end, and his horrid face accord perfectly with his &s;ordid dre&s;s. He took the lady by the hand; led her into a parlour newly &s;itted up, furni&s;hed with blue and white dama&s;k, and decorated with &s;ilk curtains elegantly drawn up in fe&s;tcons, with a &s;plendid chande|lier, and with hand&s;ome porcelain jars filled with natural flowers, then &s;carce, and of high price; &s;at down by her &s;ide on a voluptuous &s;opha; li&s;tened to her tale; ex|pre&s;&s;ed his concern; ki&s;&s;ed her hand; &s;queezed her knees a little; and promi&s;ed her, that her cou&s;in &s;hould be enlarged.&mdash;'I would have let him go any length he liked,' &s;aid the little woman, gaily, in her &s;outhern ac|cent, 'upon condition of his re&s;toring me my cou&s;in&mdash;I &s;hould only have been obliged to bathe my&s;elf afterwards.' That very evening Marat went to the committee, and her cou&s;in left the Abbey on the following day. But ere four and twenty hours had pa&s;&s;ed, the <HI>friend of the people</HI> wrote to the hu&s;band, &s;ending him a per&s;on who &s;tood in need of a certain favour, which it would not have been &s;afe to refu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="034483_0185_0FFDEA18443C3698">M. DUMAS, a natural philo&s;opher by profe&s;&s;ion, or rather a pedant by trade, waited upon the famous committee of public &s;afety, &s;ome time in the month of June, in order to make &s;ome very important propo&s;als. He offered to reconnoitre the army of the rebels in la Vend&eacute;e, and to give an exact account of its &s;ituation and numbers; circum&s;tances concerning which we have re|mained in the utmo&s;t ignorance, even &s;ince the com|mencement of the war. M. Dumas undertook to in&s;pect the whole mo&s;t accurately, by taking a bird's eye view of it from a balloon.&mdash;'Why, indeed, it is an ingenious thought,' &s;aid &s;ome of the profound politicians of the committee.&mdash;'Yes,' replied citizen Dumas: 'and it may be put into immediate execution. I know of a bal|loon, which is lying, with all its appendages, in the hotel of an emigrant; &s;o that the <HI>nation</HI> need not be at the expence of the purcha&s;e.'&mdash;Bravo! He then pro|ceeded to give the nece&s;&s;ary information, which was re|ceived with tran&s;port, and officially forwarded to the mini&s;ter of the home department, that he might &s;end for the balloon without delay. The mini&s;ter's people took the field, and made a forced march to the emigrant's ho|tel. It was an inn, and the apartment he had occupied one little room, where not a rag remained. A report was made in con&s;equence; the committee was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed be|yond mea&s;ure; Dumas was clamorous; and a fre&s;h injunction was laid upon the mini&s;ter, requiring him to make &s;tricter &s;earch after the balloon. On this the mi|ni&s;ter held a con&s;ultation with his principal clerk, and deci&s;ive mea&s;ures were re&s;olved upon. A letter was writ|ten to the department; the department turned the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="188" REF="034483_0186_0FFDEA1AEDFA91A0">
over to the municipality; and the municipality refer|red it to the admini&s;trators of police. Here the matter ended with the public functionaries; and I laughed hear|tily at the Abbey with Champagneux, who wrote the mini&s;terial letter, at the charlatanry of the brazen-faced Dumas, the &s;tupidity of the committee, the complai&s;ance of the mini&s;ter, and the whole of this long litany of follies; but I met with the &s;equel of the &s;tory at St. P&eacute;lagie.</P>
<P>CITIZEN Jubert, one of the admini&s;trators of the police, and one al&s;o of tho&s;e who &s;igned the contradictory or|ders for apprehending and &s;etting me at liberty, a true &s;ection orator, of great corpulence, thundering voice, awkward gait, and forbidding countenance, found out a certain mademoi&s;elle Lallement, a fine tall girl of fifteen, kept by St. Croix, an emigrant officer, who was a depen|dent if I recollect aright, of Philip d'Orleans. She was taken up, and &s;ent to St. P&eacute;lagie, and in her apartment were found the cover of a balloon, the net, and every thing el&s;e belonging to it. This was the very prize de|&s;cribed by Dumas; but the committee had forgotten the expedient; the philo&s;opher had lo&s;t all hopes of mak|ing him&s;elf of con&s;equence: the mini&s;ter cared little about the re&s;ult of the orders he had given; and the ad|mini&s;trators had no objection to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a thing that was now become valuable.</P>
<P>THE youthful Lallement's charms made an impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of Jubert, who had laid his hands upon &s;everal of her effects, &s;eized Sainte-Croix's portrait, and thought her a fool for pretending to be faithful to her keeper. At length imagining, that kindne&s;s would ren|der her more tractable, he procured an order for her

enlargement, came to fetch her in a carriage, conducted her to her lodgings, ordered a dinner, re&s;tored, with great reluctance, the portrait of Sainte-Croix, of which he had put out the eyes, and then laid claim to his re|ward. The young girl laughed at his preten&s;ions, as well as at his way of making love, &s;hewed him the door, and repaired to the police office, to upbraid him publicly with his attempts, and claim the other effects that had been taken away. The adventure made &s;ome noi&s;e; but Jubert's colleagues are not likely to condemn it; and it pa&s;&s;ed along with a multitude of others, &s;till more di&s;|gu&s;ting or atrocious, of which the legi&s;lators of the 2d of June daily &s;et the example to all the con&s;tituted au|thorities.</P>

<P>DO not my ears deceive me?&mdash;What! that wretched woman who lived unknown in the very heart of the country, and who came to Paris for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of &s;oliciting her daughter's enlargement, is condemned to die?&mdash;How villainous is &s;uch a condemnation!</P>
<P>PETION's pro&s;cription as a royali&s;t, was one of the won|ders of the la&s;t revolution. His wife, whom the &s;hafts of calumny had never reached, had retired to F&eacute;camp, among her own relations, there to wait in &s;ilence and re|tirement for happier days; &s;he was going to &s;et off for the &s;ea-&s;ide, that her &s;on, a fine boy of ten years of age, and the &s;ole fruit of her marriage, might have the benefit of a &s;alt-water bath. She was taken up and impri&s;oned with her child; and both have &s;ince been brought to Paris, and confined at St. P&eacute;lagie. Daily examples teach the wives of the pro&s;cribed to expect per&s;ecution; and P&eacute;tion's has &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to &s;upport her own misfortunes without murmuring; but the &s;itua|tion of her &s;on afflicts her, as equally detrimental to his health and education. She was de&s;irous of trying the effect of &s;olicitations; but how could &s;he render them intere&s;ting? How was audience to be obtained?&mdash;She wrote to her mother, who lived at Chartres, reque&s;ting her to urge her prayer in &s;uch a way as became the feel|ings of the maternal mind. Her mother came; repaired
<PB N="191" REF="034483_0189_0FFDEA2205B9AED8">
to the bar of the convention; pre&s;ented her petition with a flood of tears; was referred to the committee; and waited upon all the members who compo&s;ed it. Some of them &s;eemed to give her hope, but from the greater number &s;he experienced a very unfavourable reception. The inutility of her &s;olicitations becoming evident, &s;he re&s;olved to depart, and repaired to her &s;ection, to get her pa&s;&s;port &s;igned. There &s;he was denounced and taken into cu&s;tody. She was then carried before the mayor: a man who re&s;ided in the hotel where &s;he had taken up her abode, &s;wore to her having &s;aid that the French &s;tood in need of a king: two hired witne&s;&s;es, natives of Liege, and de&s;erters, gave the like te&s;timony; &s;he was con|demned to lo&s;e her head, and is now on her way to the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>I SAW the unfortunate woman &s;everal times, when &s;he came to keep her daughter company. Madam Le|fevre was in her fifty-&s;eventh year: &s;he had been hand|&s;ome, and her features &s;till retained &s;ome traces of their former regularity: &s;he had al&s;o pre&s;erved an ea&s;y &s;hape, and a beautiful head of hair. As the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing had occupied the greater part of her life, but had not led her to acquire any accompli&s;hment, there was nothing about her, but the remains of her former preten&s;ions, and no &s;mall &s;hare of &s;elf-love, which was perceptible on every occa&s;ion. She had no political opinion: indeed &s;he was incapable of forming one, for &s;he could not rea&s;on two minutes together on any &s;ub|ject whatever. It is po&s;&s;ible, that, in a conver&s;ation excited by ill-de&s;igning people, &s;he may have &s;aid, that &s;he did not care whether there was a king or not, provided there were but peace; or words of a like

kind may have been laid hold of, in order to bring her to trial. But who does not perceive in this fal&s;e and atro|cious application of the law, an intention to mi&s;lead the people, by making them &s;uppo&s;e the family of P&eacute;tion royali&s;ts, and the per&s;ecution it &s;uffers con&s;equently ju&s;t?</P>
<P>DREADFUL days of the reign of Tiberius, we not only &s;ee your horrors revived, but multiplied in proportion to the number of our tyrants and their favourites! This wretched people, who&s;e morals are de&s;troyed and who&s;e in&s;tinct is perverted, thir&s;ts after blood; and every thing except ju&s;tice, is employed to &s;atisfy its demand. I have &s;een in the pri&s;ons, during the four months that I have been their inhabitant, malefactors purpo&s;ely for|gotten; and yet what ha&s;te is made to inflict the penalty of death on madam Lefevre, not becau&s;e &s;he has com|mitted any crime, but becau&s;e &s;he is guilty of having for her &s;on-in-law, the worthy P&eacute;tion, whom the tyrants dete&s;t!</P>
<P>I CAN conceive nothing more ridiculous than the kna|vi&s;h impudence with which the advantages of a con|&s;titution decreed with equal zeal and rapidity are ex|tolled. But did not the very people who produced it, decree immediately after, that France was, and remained in a &s;tate of revolution? and may not the con&s;titution be con&s;idered as abortive, &s;ince no part of it is put in force? What benefit then do we derive from it? It is a dead letter, which &s;erves only to atte&s;t the impudence of tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to make a merit of it, without car|ing whether we ta&s;te the &s;weets of it or no.</P>
<P>THE multitude who accepted it without examina|tion, merely through weakne&s;s and indolence, from the

hope of &s;eeing peace, which they would not take the pains to de&s;erve, are well rewarded for their apathy. Unfortunately it is with nations and their affairs, as with individuals and their undertakings: the folly and fears of the many lead to the triumph of villainy, and to the ruin of good men. Po&s;terity will put every one in his place; but it is in the temple of memory. Themi&s;|tocles died neverthele&s;s in exile, Socrates in pri&s;on, and Sylla in his bed.</P>

<P>THE decree, that orders the act of impeachment again&s;t Bri&s;&s;ot to be pre&s;ented to-morrow, was pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;itting, in which it was propo&s;ed to &s;horten the forms of trial before the revolutionary court, and in which the four &s;ections of that tribunal were organi&s;ed: &s;o that the means of proceeding to judgment are multipli|ed, &s;entence is enjoined to be pa&s;&s;ed more &s;peedily, and the defence of the accu&s;ed is circum&s;cribed, at the very moment, when it is re&s;olved to de&s;troy Bri&s;&s;ot, and the re&s;t of the impri&s;oned deputies, that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e men of talents, who might otherwi&s;e have confounded their accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>FOUR months have pa&s;&s;ed, without its having been po&s;&s;ible to fabricate that act of accu&s;ation, the drawing up of which has been decreed &s;everal times over in vain. An increa&s;e of power, and the univer&s;al &s;way of terror, were nece&s;&s;ary, to enable our tyrants to &s;acrifice the founders of liberty. But after the arbitrary impri|&s;onment of a fourth part of France, under the appel|lation of <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> per&s;ons, has been re&s;olved upon; af|ter a &s;illy people has been in&s;pired with &s;uch a furious

<P>I AM reading a daily paper, and there I &s;ee that Robe&s;pierre accu&s;es <HI>Roland</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;&s;ot</HI> of having &s;poken ill of <HI>d'Aubigny,</HI> who &s;tole 100,000 livres [&pound;4167] at the Tuileries on the tenth of Augu&s;t, again&s;t whom a pro&s;ecution was meant to be &s;et on foot, and who&s;e wife in his ab&s;ence brought the 100,000l. to the commune. I &s;ee that Robe&s;pierre a&s;&s;erts that Roland appointed Re&s;t|out to the &s;uperintendance of the jewel-office, in order to pave the way for its being robbed; while in fact it was Pache, who upon refu&s;ing the place when offered to him by Roland, recommended Re&s;tout as a proper per&s;on to fill it. It is fact al&s;o, that the hall of the convention re&s;ounded with Roland's complaints again&s;t the commander of the national guard, for neglecting to

<P>THAT Robe&s;pierre, whom once I thought an hone&s;t man, is a very atrocious being. How he lies to his own con&s;cience! How he delights in blood!</P>

<P>WITHIN the&s;e &s;olitary walls, where oppre&s;&s;ed inno|cence has now dwelt near five months with &s;ilent re|&s;ignation, a &s;tranger appears.&mdash;It is a phy&s;ician, brought by my keepers for their own tranquillity; for to the ills of nature, as to the inju&s;tice of man, I neither can nor will oppo&s;e aught but calmne&s;s and fortitude. When he heard my name, he &s;aid he was the friend of a man, whom perhaps I did not like.&mdash;'How can you know that, and who is the per&s;on you mean?'&mdash;'Robe|&s;pierre.'&mdash;'Robe&s;pierre! I once knew him well, and e&s;teemed him much: I thought him a &s;incere and zea|lous friend of freedom.'&mdash;'Why, is he not &s;o?'&mdash;'I am afraid that he loves power: perhaps from an idea, that he knows how to do good as well as any man, and de&s;ires it no le&s;s. I am afraid that he is very fond of revenge, and inclined to exerci&s;e it particularly upon tho&s;e whom he con&s;iders as blind to his merit. I be|lieve that he is very &s;u&s;ceptible of prejudices; that his re&s;entment is ea&s;ily excited; and that he is too ready to think every one guilty, who does not &s;ub&s;cribe to all his opinions.&mdash;You never &s;aw him above once or twice in your life!&mdash;I have &s;een him much oftener!&mdash;
<PB N="196" REF="034483_0194_0FFDEA319DD471B0">
A&s;k him: let him lay his hand upon his heart; and you will &s;ee whether he have it in his power to &s;ay any thing to my di&s;advantage.'</P>
<P>ROBESPIERRE, if I deceive my&s;elf, I put it in your power to convince me of my error. It is to your&s;elf that I repeat what I have &s;aid of you, and it is to your friend that I mean to deliver this letter, which my keepers will perhaps &s;uffer to pa&s;s, for the &s;ake of the per&s;on to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I WRITE not to intreat you, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e. I never yet intreated any one: and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly I &s;hall not begin to do &s;o from a pri&s;on, while writing to a man who has me in his power. Prayers become the guilty, or the &s;lave: innocence vindicates her&s;elf, which is quite &s;ufficient; or complains, as &s;he has a right to do, when the object of per&s;ecution. But even complaints accord not with my di&s;po&s;ition; I can &s;uf|fer, and dare look any &s;hape of misfortune in the face. Be&s;ides I know that, at the birth of republics, revolutions, which are almo&s;t inevitable, and which give too great &s;cope to the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind, frequently expo&s;e tho&s;e who &s;erve their country be&s;t to become the victims of their own zeal, and of the delu&s;ion of their country|men. They will have a good con&s;cience for their con&s;o|lation, and hi&s;tory for their avenger.</P>
<P>BUT by what &s;trange chance is a woman like me, inca|pable of any thing but wi&s;hes, expo&s;ed to tho&s;e &s;torms, which generally bur&s;t upon the heads of none but effici|ent individuals? And what is the fate that I have to expect? The&s;e are two que&s;tions, which I beg you to re&s;olve.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="034483_0195_0FFDEA332AEFAB30">I DEEM them of &s;mall importance either in them&s;elves, or as far as my individual per&s;on is concerned; for what is a &s;ingle emmet more or le&s;s, cru&s;hed by the foot of the elephant, in the general &s;y&s;tem of the world? But they are of infinite intere&s;t in regard to the pre|&s;ent liberty and future happine&s;s of my country. For if its declared enemies, and its acknowledged friends and defenders be indi&s;criminately confounded; if the faithful citizen and generous patriot be treated in the &s;ame man|ner as the man of a corrupt and &s;elfi&s;h &s;oul, or the per|fidious ari&s;tocrate; if the woman of virtue and &s;en&s;ibi|lity, who is proud of the freedom of her country, and, who in her humble retirement, or in any other &s;ituation, makes every po&s;&s;ible &s;acrifice to its welfare, find her&s;elf a&s;&s;ociated in puni&s;hment with the vain or haughty fe|male, who cur&s;es equality; &s;urely ju&s;tice and freedom do not yet reign, and future happine&s;s is doubtful.</P>
<P>I SPEAK not here of my venerable hu&s;band. A re|port ought to have been made of his accounts, when he fir&s;t gave them in: in&s;tead of refu&s;ing him ju&s;tice at fir&s;t, in order to retain the power of accu&s;ing him, when ca|lumny &s;hould have deprived him of the public e&s;teem. Robe&s;pierre, I defy you not to believe, that Roland is an hone&s;t man. You may be of opinion, that he does not think ju&s;tly, with re&s;pect to this or that mea&s;ure: but your con&s;cience mu&s;t &s;ecretly do ju&s;tice to his integrity and civi&s;m: he needs to be &s;een little, to be thoroughly known; his book is always open, and is intelligible to every one. He has the ruggedne&s;s of virtue, as Cato had its a&s;perity; and has made by the har&s;hne&s;s of his man|ner as many enemies as by his inflexible equity: but
<PB N="198" REF="034483_0196_0FFDEA35D6DFB298">
the&s;e inequalities of &s;urface di&s;appear at a di&s;tance, and the great qualities of the public man will remain for ever. It has been reported, that he fanned the flames of civil war at Lyons: and this pretext has been brought forward as a rea&s;on for my apprehen&s;ion! The &s;uppo&s;i|tion was not more ju&s;t than the con&s;equence. Di&s;gu&s;ted with public affairs, irritated by per&s;ecution, tired of the world, fatigued by his toils, and bending beneath the weight of years, what could he do but conceal his &s;or|rows in an ob&s;cure retirement, and &s;ave the unworthy age in which he lives from the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime?</P>
<P>HE has corrupted the public mind, and I am his accomplice!&mdash;This is the mo&s;t curious of all reproaches, of all imputations the mo&s;t ab&s;urd. You cannot wi&s;h me, Robe&s;pierre, to take the trouble of refuting them here: the ta&s;k would be too ea&s;y, e&s;pecially as you can|not be one of the well meaning people, who believe a &s;tory becau&s;e it is in print, or becau&s;e they have heard it related. My pretended implication in the guilt would be truly laughable, were not the whole rendered atrocious by the mi&s;ty medium through which it is pre&s;ented to the people, who, being able to perceive nothing di&s;tinctly, figure to their imagination a thou&s;and mon&s;trous forms. Great mu&s;t be the inclination to injure me of tho&s;e, who include me in this malicious and premeditated manner, in an accu&s;ation &s;trongly re&s;embling the charge of high trea&s;on, &s;o often brought forward under the reign of Tiberius, again&s;t every one who was de&s;tined to de&s;truc|tion, though guilty of no crime. Whence, then, does this animo&s;ity ari&s;e? It is what I cannot conceive: I, who
<PB N="199" REF="034483_0197_0FFDEA388A2BE1C0">
never injured any one, and who am even incapable of wi&s;hing evil in return for the injuries I receive.</P>
<P>BROUGHT up in retirement; devoted from my youth to tho&s;e &s;erious &s;tudies, which have given &s;ome degree of energy to my mind; ble&s;t with a ta&s;te for &s;imple plea|&s;ures which no change of circum&s;tances has been able to pervert; an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of the revolution, and giving way to the energy of the generous &s;entiments it in&s;pires; kept a &s;tranger to public affairs by prin|ciple as well as by my &s;ex, but conver&s;ing about them with warmth, becau&s;e the public weal takes the lead of all other concerns as &s;oon as it exi&s;ts; I regarded the fir&s;t calumnies invented again&s;t me as contemptible follies; I deemed them the nece&s;&s;ary tribute levied by envy upon a &s;ituation, which the vulgar had &s;till the imbecility to con&s;ider as exalted, and to which I would have preferred the peaceful &s;tate, in which I had &s;pent &s;o many happy days.</P>
<P>THESE calumnies, however, have increa&s;ed with effron|tery proportionate to my calmne&s;s and &s;ecurity: I have been dragged to pri&s;on, and have remained there near five months; torn from the embraces of my helple&s;s daughter, who can no longer recline her head on that bo&s;om whence &s;he drew her fir&s;t nouri&s;hment; far re|moved from every thing dear to me; cut off from all communication with the world; the butt of all the ran|corous abu&s;e of a deluded populace, who believe that my death would be conducive to their happine&s;s; hear|ing the guards, who watch under my grated window, diverting them&s;elves with the idea of my puni&s;hment; and reading the offen&s;ive reproaches ca&s;t upon me by
<PB N="200" REF="034483_0198_0FFDEB2B724840E0">
writers, who never &s;aw my face, any more than the other per&s;ons of who&s;e hatred I am the object.</P>
<P>I HAVE wearied no one with my remon&s;trances; I have hoped for ju&s;tice, and an end to prejudice, from the hand of time; wanting many things, I have a&s;ked for nothing: I have made up my mind to misfortune, proud of trying my &s;trength with her, and with tramp|ling her under my feet. My nece&s;&s;ities becoming ur|gent, and afraid of bringing trouble upon tho&s;e to whom I might have addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, I wi&s;hed to &s;ell the empty bottles in my cellar, which had not been &s;ealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p, be|cau&s;e it contained nothing of greater value. Immediately the whole town was in an uproar! The hou&s;e was &s;ur|rounded; the proprietor was taken into cu&s;tody; the guards were doubled; and perhaps I have rea&s;on to fear for the liberty of a poor &s;ervant, who is guilty of no crime but that of having &s;erved me for the la&s;t thirteen years with affection, becau&s;e I took care to render her life comfortable. So much does the people, mi&s;led with regard to me, and deluded by harangues again&s;t con&s;pi|rators, think me de&s;erving of that name.</P>
<P>IT is not, Robe&s;pierre, to excite your compa&s;&s;ion, which I am above a&s;king, and which I &s;hould perhaps deem an in&s;ult, that I pre&s;ent you with a picture far le&s;s melancholly than the truth; it is for your in&s;truction.</P>
<P>FORTUNE is fickle; and popular favour is not le&s;s liable to change. Contemplate the fate of tho&s;e, who have agitated, plea&s;ed, or governed the people, from Vi&s;cellinus to Cae&s;ar, and from Hippo, the harangue-maker of Syracu&s;e, to our Pari&s;ian orators. Ju&s;tice and truth alone remain, and are a con&s;olation in every
<PB N="201" REF="034483_0199_0FFDC5A831C6DFC8">
misfortune, even in the hour of death it&s;elf; while no|thing can afford a &s;helter from &s;trokes of con&s;cience and remor&s;e. Marius and Sylla pro&s;cribed thou&s;ands of knights, a great number of &s;enators, and a multitude of wretched men. But could they &s;tifle the voice of hi&s;tory, which has devoted their memories to execra|tion? or was content an inmate of their minds?</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the fate re&s;erved for me, I will find courage to undergo it in a manner worthy of my&s;elf; or to anticipate the &s;troke, as may &s;uit me be&s;t. After the honours of per&s;ecution, do tho&s;e of martyrdom await me? am I de&s;tined to langui&s;h in protracted cap|tivity, expo&s;ed to the fir&s;t cata&s;trophe, that it may be judged requi&s;ite to bring about? or am I to be &s;enten|ced to tran&s;portation as it is called, in order to experi|ence, when a few leagues out at &s;ea, that trifling negli|gence on the part of the captain, which rids him of the trouble of his living cargo, and enriches the waves? Speak! it is &s;omething to know our fate, and a &s;oul like mine is capable of looking it in the face.</P>
<P>IF you wi&s;h to be ju&s;t, and attend to what I write, my letter will not be u&s;ele&s;s to you, and in that ca&s;e it may po&s;&s;ibly be of &s;ervice to my country. But be it as it may, Robe&s;pierre, I know, and you cannot help feeling, that a per&s;on, who has known me, cannot per&s;ecute me without remor&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ROLAND</HI>'s FIRST ADMINISTRATION.</HEAD>
<P>HOW came Louis XVI. to &s;elect for the admini&s;|tration of public affairs a man like Roland, to whom, as an au&s;tere philo&s;opher, and a laborious &s;tudent, re|tirement was doubly dear? This will be a que&s;tion with many people, and it would be one with me, were I any other than what I am. I am going to an&s;wer it by facts.</P>
<P>RESIDENT at Lyons, during the winter, and belong|ing to the &s;cientific and literary academies of that city, Roland was employed by the agricultural &s;ociety to draw up its memoirs for the information of the States Ge|neral. His principles, and his turn of mind, made him naturally look forward with plea&s;ure to a revolution which promi&s;ed the reform of &s;o many abu&s;es. The publicity of the&s;e &s;entiments and his well known talents procured him his admi&s;&s;ion into the electoral body upon the fir&s;t formation of the commune, and his &s;ub&s;equent inve&s;tment with the admini&s;tration of the finances of the city, which was deeply involved in debt. Being &s;ent as a deputy extraordinary to the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, he connected him&s;elf at Paris with &s;everal of its members, and with &s;ome of the per&s;ons who devoted them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of public affairs. He returned home, how|ever, when the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his place of in&s;pector, by
<PB N="2" REF="034483_0202_0FFDEA4087E08E48">
changing his de&s;tiny, obliged him to reflect on the cour&s;e it would become him in future to pur&s;ue. The que&s;tion was, whether he &s;hould retire altogether to his e&s;tate in the country, and employ him&s;elf in its cultiva|tion; or whether, continuing his literary labours, he &s;hould make a journey to Paris, with the double view of collecting materials for that purpo&s;e, and of enforcing his claims to a pen&s;ion, as a reward for thirty years &s;er|vice in his admini&s;trative employ. The latter mea&s;ure was adopted, becau&s;e it would not prevent his recurring to the other, whenever he &s;hould deem it advi&s;able &s;o to do. We returned, then, to Paris on the 15th of De|cember, 1791; but the affairs of the nation at large did not permit us to hope, that the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, which had ju&s;t met, would be &s;oon at lei&s;ure to attend to the concerns of a private individual. Roland, inti|mate with Bri&s;&s;ot, became acquainted with &s;everal of his colleagues in the legi&s;lative body; and not unfrequently went to the &s;ociety of Jacobins, with old friends &s;ettled at Paris, who like him were delighted with a revolution which they e&s;teemed friendly to liberty, who thought that the &s;ociety had already been u&s;eful, and might &s;till help to &s;upport a good cau&s;e.</P>
<P>ROLAND, content with being a peaceful auditor, never a&s;cended the tribune to &s;peak. He was known however, not indeed to the illiterate, who had as yet gained no a&s;cendance, but to many others; and was appointed one of the committee of corre&s;pondence. This committee, of which the functions are indicated by the name, was compo&s;ed of a con&s;iderable number of members, but
<PB N="3" REF="034483_0203_0FFDEA435C722E48">
only a few were actively employed. Roland often came home with a con&s;iderable packet of letters to an&s;wer: for though the bu&s;ine&s;s was divided into departments, and particular ones a&s;&s;igned to particular members, it became neverthele&s;s a matter of nece&s;&s;ity for the more diligent to take upon them&s;elves the duty of the re&s;t, that no part of the corre&s;pondence might remain in ar|rears.&mdash;I read tho&s;e letters, and often undertook to an|&s;wer them, epi&s;tolary writing having ever appeared to me &s;ingularly ea&s;y and agreeable, becau&s;e it adapts it&s;elf to every &s;ubject, and to every &s;tyle alike, giving to di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t plea&s;ing form, and to rea&s;on all the &s;cope it can de&s;ire.&mdash;I remarked in mo&s;t of the letters from the departments, a &s;tyle exalted and emphatical, &s;entiments tinctured with bomba&s;t, and con&s;equently with affecta|tion, and in general a de&s;ire of the public good, or the ambition of appearing an ardent patriot. I con&s;idered that the parent &s;ociety might exert its influence in di&s;|&s;eminating good principles, taking care always to confine it&s;elf to the in&s;truction of the people, and to the commu|nication of &s;entiments calculated to &s;trengthen the &s;ocial tye, and con&s;equently to in&s;pire the true love of our country, which ought to be only that of human kind, carried to the highe&s;t pitch in regard to tho&s;e who live under the &s;ame laws with our&s;elves, and exalted by a di&s;|regard of &s;elf-intere&s;t in the unfrequent, but &s;ometimes urgent, ca&s;es, which require the greate&s;t &s;acrifices. Per|&s;uaded that a revolution is no better than a terrible, and de&s;tructive &s;torm, if the improvement of the public mind do not keep pace with the progre&s;&s;ion of events; and
<PB N="4" REF="034483_0204_0FFDEA4607361D78">
&s;en&s;ible of the good that might be done by taking hold of men's imaginations, and giving them an impul&s;ion towards virtue, I employed my&s;elf with plea&s;ure in the corre&s;pondence. The committee gave Roland credit for his indu&s;try; nor indeed was he idle; but the work of two expeditious per&s;ons mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been great in the eyes of tho&s;e, to whom the labours of either would have appeared con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>A FEW members of the a&s;&s;embly u&s;ed to meet fre|quently in private, at a hou&s;e in the Place Vend&ocirc;me, where one of them lodged, and where a worthy and opulent woman had it in her power, without putting her|&s;elf to inconvenience, to lend them an apartment, of which they were to make u&s;e, even in her ab&s;ence. Roland, who was e&s;teemed for his good &s;en&s;e and in|tegrity, was invited to join them; but he &s;eldom went, on account of the di&s;tance. As to me, I lived at home according to cu&s;tom; I was not in health, and kept little company.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of affairs, and the di&s;content of the public mind, alarmed the court. The mini&s;ters &s;oon became the objects of public animadver&s;ion, and indeed their whole proceeding only tended to undermine a con|&s;titution which the king had &s;worn to contrary to his inclination, and which he did not mean to maintain. The court, unea&s;y and perplexed, in the mid&s;t of the frequent changes and agitation of the mini&s;try, knew not on whom to fix its choice. But there were people who declared openly, that if Louis XVI. were &s;incere, he would take men of undoubted patrioti&s;m for his
<PB N="5" REF="034483_0205_0FFDEA48AED06000">
agents. At length, impelled by weakne&s;s or by fear, the court came to a deci&s;ion, but it was with the hope of corrupting, or if that hope failed, with the inten|tion of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing, the mini&s;ters it &s;hould appoint. The court then &s;hewed it&s;elf inclined to make choice among tho&s;e called patriots; and at that time the term had not been abu&s;ed. How was this brought about? I never knew, nor did I ever enquire, becau&s;e it appeared to me, that in that, as in all other ca&s;es, the idea was fir&s;t &s;tarted by &s;ome few individuals, propagated by others, and at la&s;t taken up and acted upon by people in power. By reflecting minds it was con&s;idered as im|portant, to direct the attention of the court towards men of abilities, and of re&s;pectable character; for it was po&s;|&s;ible that it might take a malicious plea&s;ure in &s;electing hot-headed Jacobins, who&s;e extravagance might ju&s;tify complaint, and &s;erve to bring patrioti&s;m into contempt. I know not who fir&s;t mentioned Roland, in the com|mittee at the <HI>Place Vend&ocirc;me,</HI> as one of tho&s;e who ought not to be overlooked. The name of Roland was nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;ociated with the idea of a well informed man, who had written upon the &s;ubject of admini&s;tration, who was not de&s;titute of experience in that line, who was be&s;ides in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fair reputation, and who&s;e age, manners, and decided character, joined to the prin|ciples he had openly profe&s;&s;ed, even before the revolu|tion, be&s;poke him a worthy partizan of liberty, in every point of view.&mdash;The king him&s;elf was no &s;tranger to the above con&s;iderations, or at lea&s;t to the facts upon which they were founded, as I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to

&s;hew. Tho&s;e ideas aro&s;e &s;o naturally out of the circum|&s;tances of the moment, that they were communicated to us only three days before the formation of the new mini&s;try.&mdash;Bri&s;&s;ot called upon me one evening when I was alone, and informed me of the probability of Ro|land's elevation. I &s;miled, and a&s;ked him the meaning of his plea&s;antry. But he a&s;&s;ured me it was no joke, related to me the particulars I have ju&s;t mentioned, and added, that he was come to know whether Roland would take upon him &s;uch a ta&s;k. I promi&s;ed to con&s;ult him, and make known his re&s;olution on the following day. Roland was as much a&s;toni&s;hed at the event as my&s;elf; but his natural activity rendered him by no means aver&s;e to a multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, and be &s;aid to me with a &s;mile, he had always &s;een people in power &s;o mi&s;erably deficient, that he had never cea&s;ed to wonder how the public concerns could go forward at all; and that con&s;equently the thing in it&s;elf gave him no alarm. The circum&s;tances of the times were indeed critical, on account of the intere&s;ts of the court, and the uncertainty of the king's intentions; but to a man attached to his duty, and caring little for the lo&s;s of his place while fulfilling its duties, the ri&s;k of acceptance was not great. Be&s;ides, a zealous man who had a right to &s;ome confi|dence in his talents, could not be in&s;en&s;ible to the hope of &s;erving his country. Roland then decided in the affirma|tive, and made known his intentions to Bri&s;&s;ot. The fol|lowing day, the latter accompanied Dumouriez, who came to Roland's hou&s;e at eleven o'clock at night, after the breaking up of the council, to inform him, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="7" REF="034483_0207_0FFDEA4E0E7176C8">
of orders, of which he was the bearer, that the king had ju&s;t cho&s;en him mini&s;ter for the home depart|ment. Dumouriez, a mini&s;ter of recent date, &s;poke of the king's &s;incere determination to &s;upport the con&s;titu|tion, and of his hope of &s;eeing the machine &s;et to work as &s;oon as the &s;ame &s;pirit &s;hould pervade the whole coun|cil, te&s;tifying at the &s;ame time to Roland his particular &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing a virtuous and enlightened patriot like him, called upon to take a &s;hare in the government.</P>
<P>BRISSOT ob&s;erved, that in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of af|fairs, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the home department was the mo&s;t delicate, and the mo&s;t laborious; and that the minds of the friends of liberty would be at ea&s;e on &s;eeing it en|tru&s;ted to hands &s;o &s;teady and &s;o pure. The conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed lightly over the&s;e matters, and an hour of the next day was appointed for Roland to be pre&s;ented to the king, and to take his oath and his &s;eat in the council. I found in Dumouriez the deliberate air of a &s;oldier, the addre&s;s of a &s;kilful courtier, and the conver&s;ation of a man of wit, but not the &s;malle&s;t trace of &s;incerity or truth.&mdash;On comparing this man with his new colleague, who&s;e frankne&s;s and au&s;terity &s;ometimes bordered upon rudene&s;s, I a&s;ked my&s;elf if it were po&s;&s;ible for beings &s;o di&s;&s;imilar to act long in concert?&mdash;'There goes a man,' &s;aid Roland, on their taking leave, 'who di&s;covers a great deal of patrioti&s;m, and appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s abilities.' &mdash;'Yes,' &s;aid I, 'and again&s;t whom you will do well to be on your guard; for I believe him capable of worming you out of place as &s;oon as any man, if you do not &s;teer a cour&s;e to plea&s;e him.'&mdash;'We &s;hall &s;ee,' &s;aid Roland.</P>

<P>LOUIS XVI. behaved to his new mini&s;ters with the greate&s;t appearance of &s;implicity and good nature. This man was not preci&s;ely what he was repre&s;ented to be by tho&s;e who took a plea&s;ure in vilifying him: he was neither the bruti&s;h blockhead, who was held up to the contempt of the people: nor was he the worthy and kind creature, whom his friends extolled to the &s;kies. &mdash;Nature had endowed him with ordinary faculties, which would have &s;erved him well in an ob&s;cure &s;tation, but he was depraved by his princely education, and ruined by his mediocrity in difficult times, when his &s;al|vation could only be effected by the union of genius and virtue. A common under&s;tanding, educated for

the throne, and taught di&s;&s;imulation from the earlie&s;t in|fancy, has a great advantage in its commerce with man|kind. The art of &s;hewing to each per&s;on only what it is proper for him to &s;ee, is <HI>in him</HI> no more than a ha|bit, the practice of which gives him the appearance of ability; but a man mu&s;t be born an idiot indeed to appear a fool in &s;uch a &s;ituation. Louis XVI. po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed be&s;ides an excellent memory, and an active turn of mind; was never idle, and read a great deal. He had al&s;o a ready recollection of the various treaties ex|i&s;ting between France and the neighbouring nations, was well read in hi&s;tory, and was the be&s;t geographer in the kingdom. His knowledge of the names, and his application of them to the faces, of all the per&s;ons about the court to whom they belonged, as well as his ac|quaintance with the anecdotes peculiar to each, had been extended to all the individuals who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in any manner during the revolution; &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;ent to him a candidate for any place, concerning whom he had not formed an opi|nion, founded on particular facts. But Louis XVI. without elevation of &s;oul, energy of mind, or firmne&s;s of temper, had &s;uffered his views to be &s;till further contracted, and his &s;entiments to be twi&s;ted, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, by religious prejudices, and je&s;uiti|cal principles. Elevated ideas of religion, a belief in God, and the hope of immortality, accord well with philo&s;ophy, and fix it upon a broader ba&s;is, at the &s;ame time that they compo&s;e the be&s;t ornaments of the &s;uper&s;tructure. Woe to the legi&s;lators who de&s;pi&s;e

the&s;e powerful means of in&s;piring political virtue, and of pre&s;erving the morals of the people! Even if they were illu&s;ions yet unborn, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to create and fo&s;ter them for the con&s;olation of mankind. But the religion of our prie&s;ts pre&s;ents nothing but ob|jects of puerile fear, and mi&s;erable mummeries, to &s;up|ply the place of good actions; and &s;anctifies be|&s;ides all the maxims of de&s;poti&s;m which the autho|rity of the church call in to its aid. Louis XVI. was afraid of hell, and excommunication: with &s;uch weakne&s;s as this it was impo&s;&s;ible not to make a mi&s;er|able king. Had he been born two centuries before, and had his wife been a rational woman, he would have made no more noi&s;e in the world, than many other princes of the Capetian line, who have "fretted their hour upon the &s;tage," without doing much good or much harm.&mdash;But rai&s;ed to the throne when the profligacy of Louis XV's court was at the highe&s;t, and the di&s;order of the finances extreme, he was led away by a giddy woman, who joined to Au&s;trian in&s;olence the per&s;umption of youth and high birth, an inordi|nate love of plea&s;ure, and all the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of a light mind; and who was her&s;elf &s;educed by the vices of an A&s;iatic court, for which &s;he had been but too well pre|pared by the example of her mother.&mdash;Louis XVI, too weak to hold the reins of a government that was running to de&s;truction, ha&s;tened their common ruin by innumerable faults. Necker, who always mixed up pa|thos in his politics as he did in his &s;tyle, was a man of moderate abilities, of whom the public entertained a
<PB N="11" REF="034483_0211_0FFDEA58D3E97150">
good opinion, becau&s;e he had a very high opinion of him&s;elf, and proclaimed it without re&s;erve; but void of all political fore&s;ight, a kind of outrageous finan|cier, who could calculate nothing but the contents of a pur&s;e, and who &s;poke forever of his character with|out rhime or rea&s;on, as women of gallantry do of their virtue; Necker was a bad pilot for France, when &s;uch a &s;torm was gathering round the horrizon. France was in a manner de&s;titute of <HI>men;</HI> their &s;carcity has been tru|ly &s;urpri&s;ing in this revolution, in which hardly any thing but pigmies have appeared. I do not mean that there was any want of wit, of knowledge, of learn|ing, of accompli&s;hments, or of philo&s;ophy. The&s;e in|gredients, on the contrary, were never &s;o common: it was like the la&s;t glimmering of an expiring taper; but as to that energy of &s;oul which J. J. Rou&s;&s;eau has &s;o well defined by calling it the fir&s;t attribute of a hero, &s;upported by that &s;olidity of judgment which knows how to &s;et a true value upon every thing, and by tho&s;e exten&s;ive views which look into futurity, con&s;tituting together the character of a great man, they were &s;ought for every where, and were &s;carcely any where to be found.</P>
<P>LOUIS XVI. con&s;tantly fluctuating between the fear of irritating his &s;ubjects, and the inclination of keeping them in awe, while incapable of governing them, con|vened the &s;tates general in&s;tead of retrenching his ex|pences, and introducing order into his court. After having him&s;elf &s;owed the &s;eeds, and provided the means of innovation, he attempted to prevent it by the affec|tation
<PB N="12" REF="034483_0212_0FFDEA5C9B915B98">
of a power, again&s;t which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed a principle of counteraction, and by &s;o doing only taught his people to re&s;i&s;t. Nothing remained for him but to &s;acrifice one portion of his authority with a good grace, in order to pre&s;erve in the other the means of re|covering the whole; but for want of knowing how to go about it, he turned his attention to petty intrigues, the only kind familiar to the per&s;ons cho&s;en by him&s;elf, or favoured by the queen. He had however re&s;erved in the con&s;titution &s;ufficient means of power and of hap|pine&s;s, had he known how to be content; &s;o that, wanting as he was in abilities to prevent its e&s;tabli&s;hment, he might &s;till have been &s;aved by the rectitude of his conduct, if after having accepted it, he had &s;incerely en|deavoured to promote its execution. But always prote&s;t|ing, on one hand, his intention to &s;upport what he was undermining on the other, the obliquity of his pro|ceedings, and the fallacy of his conduct, began by awakening di&s;tru&s;t, and ended by exciting indignation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had appointed patriotic mini&s;ters, he made it his &s;ole &s;tudy to in&s;pire them with confidence; and &s;o well did he &s;ucceed, that during the fir&s;t three weeks, Roland and Claviere were enchanted with the good intentions of the king. They dreamt of nothing but a better order of things, and flattered them&s;elves that the revolution was at an end. 'Good heaven!' I u&s;ed to &s;ay, 'I never &s;ee you &s;et off for the council with that wonderful confidence, but it &s;eems to me that you are about to commit &s;ome egregious act of folly.' 'I a&s;&s;ure you,' would Claviere an&s;wer, 'the king is per|fectly

&s;en&s;ible, that his intere&s;t is connected with the ob&s;ervance of the new laws: he rea&s;ons too pertinently on the &s;ubject not to be convinced of it.' '<HI>Ma f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i,</HI>' added Roland, 'if he be not an hone&s;t man, he is the mo&s;t arrant knave in the kingdom: it is impo&s;&s;ible for di&s;&s;imulation to be carried to &s;o great a length.' As to me, I always replied, I had no faith in that love for the con&s;titution profe&s;&s;ed by a man who had been brought up in the prejudices of de&s;po|ti&s;m, and in the habits of enjoying it, and who&s;e re|cent conduct proved him wanting both in genius and virtue.&mdash;My great argument was the flight to Varennes.</P>
<P>THE &s;ittings of the council were held in a manner that might pa&s;s for de&s;cent, in compari&s;on of what they afterwards became; but with puerility, if regard be had to the important matters which called for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Each of the mini&s;ters who had <HI>bons</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orders on the Trea&s;ury.</NOTE> to be &s;igned, or bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;imilar nature, regulated by the law, pecu|liar to his department, and concerning which there was no occa&s;ion to deliberate, waited upon the king, on the day appointed, previou&s;ly to the meeting of the coun|cil, to tran&s;act tho&s;e particular and &s;ubordinate affairs. They all repaired afterwards to the council chamber; and there the proclamations that related to the &s;ubjects of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion were taken out of the port-folio. The mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice next pre&s;ented the decrees for the royal a&s;&s;ent; and then the council proceeded, or ought to have proceeded, to deliberate upon the operations of government, the &s;tate of affairs at home and abroad,
<PB N="14" REF="034483_0214_0FFDEA60F0B23790">
the que&s;tion of peace and war, &amp;c. As to proclama|tions adapted to exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, it was only ne|ce&s;&s;ary to examine the decree, and the propriety of its application, which was readily done. All this time the king &s;uffered his mini&s;ters to confer, while he read the ga|zette, or the Engli&s;h new&s;papers in the original language, or el&s;e wrote a few letters. The &s;anctioning of decrees obtained more of his attention: he &s;eldom gave his con|&s;ent ea&s;ily; and never without refu&s;al, always declining to accede to the fir&s;t reque&s;t, and po&s;tponing the matter to the next meeting, when he came with his opinion ready form|ed, though appearing to ground it upon the arguments brought forward in the debate. As to great political affairs he often eluded their inve&s;tigation, by &s;hifting the conver|&s;ation to general topics, or to &s;ubjects &s;uited to each par|ticular per&s;on. If war were the que&s;tion, he would talk of travelling; if diplomatic concerns were upon the carpet, he would advert to the manners, or inquire into the local peculiarities of the country; or if the &s;tate of af|fairs at home were in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, he would dwell upon &s;ome trifling detail of economy or agriculture. Roland he would que&s;tion about his works, Dumouriez con|cerning anecdotes, and &s;o on: the council-chamber was converted into a coffee-room, where the governors of the empire amu&s;ed them&s;elves with idle chat: no mi|nutes were taken of the proceedings; there was no &s;e|cretary to keep them; nor was any thing done in a &s;itting of three hours except &s;igning a few papers. Such was the farce that was acted three times a week. &mdash;'Why it is pitiable!' cried I out of all patience,
<PB N="15" REF="034483_0215_0FFDEA63C114B7D8">
when on Roland's return, I inquired what had pa&s;&s;ed&mdash; 'You are all in good humour, becau&s;e you experience no contradiction, and are treated with civility. You &s;eem indeed to do whatever you plea&s;e in your &s;everal departments; but I am &s;adly afraid that you are duped &mdash;'the public bu&s;ine&s;s however is not at a &s;tand'&mdash; 'no, but much time is lo&s;t; for in the torrent of affairs that overwhelms you, I would rather &s;ee you employ three hours in &s;olitary meditation on the great intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, than &s;pend them in idle conver&s;ation.' In the mean time the enemy were making preparations, and it had become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to declare war; a mea&s;ure which was the &s;ubject of an animated di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, and which the king did not &s;eem to take with|out extreme repugnance. He had long delayed the deci&s;ion; and appeared only to yield to the well-known opinion of the majority of the a&s;&s;embly, and to the unanimous voice of the council. Soon after, the con|tinuation or the multiplicity of religious troubles ren|dered tho&s;e coercive mea&s;ures indi&s;pen&s;able, which the mini&s;ter of the interior had long &s;olicited in vain, while the threatening, and formidable attitude of the foreign armies in&s;pired the mini&s;ter of war with the idea of a regulation, which the convention adopted with enthu&s;i|a&s;m, and deecreed without delay.</P>
<P>IT is true that the&s;e two decrees, one for the formation of a camp of twenty thou&s;and men near Paris, the other concerning the prie&s;ts, were altogether deci&s;ive. The court perceived that they would overturn its &s;ecret treachery, the partial revolts fomented by fanatici&s;m,
<PB N="16" REF="034483_0216_0FFDEA678B671CF8">
and the progre&s;s of the enemy, which it &s;avoured. The king was too firmly re&s;olved to refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent, to be in any ha&s;te to confe&s;s his determination, and devi&s;ed various pretences by means of which he eluded the que&s;tion for more than a fortnight. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this matter was &s;everal times renewed. Roland and Servan were urgent in their repre&s;entations, becau&s;e each of them felt the importance and nece&s;&s;ity of the law that regarded his par|ticular department; the general advantage was evident to all, and the &s;ix mini&s;ters in this re&s;pect were all of the &s;ame opinion. In the mean time Dumouriez, who&s;e loo&s;e conver&s;ation the king encouraged, and who&s;e manners did not render him unfit for the meridian of a court, was &s;ent for &s;everal times to the queen. He had a little affront to revenge, and wi&s;hed to get rid of colleagues, who&s;e au&s;terity accorded ill with his gay turn of mind: hence he was induced to enter into agreements of which the effect was &s;oon perceived.</P>
<P>As to me, I felt a kind of agitation difficult to de|&s;cribe: delighted with the revolution; per&s;uaded that, with all its faults, it was nece&s;&s;ary to enforce the con&s;titu|tion; and ardently de&s;iring to &s;ee my country pro&s;per, the lowering a&s;pect of public affairs gave me a moral fever, which raged without intermi&s;&s;ion. The king's de|lays demon&s;trated his duplicity; and Roland had no lon|ger any doubt upon the &s;ubject: there remained then but one re&s;olution for an hone&s;t mini&s;ter to take, and that was to go out of office, in ca&s;e Louis XVI. &s;hould ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to take the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of the &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="034483_0217_0FFDEA69173CE210">THAT &s;tep, unattended by any other, might perhaps have &s;atisfied the con&s;cience of a timid man; but for a zealous citizen, it is not enough to renounce a po&s;t in which good is no longer to be done; it behoves him to &s;ay &s;o with energy, that he may throw light upon the public calamities, and render his re&s;ignation bene|ficial to his country.&mdash;Roland and I had long lamented the weakne&s;s of his colleagues. The tardine&s;s of the king had &s;ugge&s;ted the idea, that it might be of great u&s;e to addre&s;s a letter to him from the mini&s;ters collectively, &s;etting forth the rea&s;ons which had already been given in the council, but which, when expre&s;&s;ed upon paper, and &s;igned by them all, with the offer of their re&s;ignation in ca&s;e his maje&s;ty &s;hould not think proper to li&s;ten to their repre&s;entations, might either force him to compliance, or expo&s;e him to the eyes of all France. I drew up the letter, after having agreed upon the fundamental points with Roland, and Roland made the propo&s;al to his colleagues.&mdash;All ap|proved of the idea, but mo&s;t of them differed as to the execution. Claviere objected to &s;ome phra&s;e or other; Duranthon was inclined to temporize; and Laco&s;te was in no ha&s;te to &s;ub&s;cribe his name. As &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould be the effect of a fir&s;t glance and of a lively &s;en&s;e of its propriety, the failure of our attempt was a hint not to repeat it. It became then nece&s;&s;ary to act in an in&s;ualted character, and &s;ince the council had not &s;pirit enough to &s;tand forth together. it behoved the man who &s;et events at a defiance to take upon him&s;elf a ta&s;k which the whole body &s;hould have fulfilled: the que&s;tion was no longer to re&s;ign, but to de&s;erve to be

di&s;mi&s;&s;ed&mdash;to &s;ay, do thus or we will retire; but to a&s;&s;ert that all was lo&s;t unle&s;s a proper line of conduct were pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>I COMPOSED the famous letter. Here I mu&s;t digre&s;s for a moment to clear up the doubts, and to fix the opinion of a number of per&s;ons, of whom the greater part only allow me a little merit, that they may deny it to my hu&s;band, while many others &s;uppo&s;e me to have had a kind of influence in public affairs entirely di&s;cor|dant with my turn of mind. Studious habits and a ta&s;te for literature made me participate in his labours, as long as he remained a private individual&mdash;I wrote with him as I ate with him, becau&s;e one was almo&s;t as natural to me as the other, and becau&s;e my exi&s;tence being de|voted to his happine&s;s, I applied my&s;elf to tho&s;e things which gave him the greate&s;t plea&s;ure. Roland wrote treati&s;es on the arts; I did the &s;ame, although the &s;ub|ject was tedious to me. He was fond of erudition; I helped him to pur&s;ue his critical re&s;earches. Did he wi&s;h by way of recreation, to compo&s;e an e&s;&s;ay for &s;ome academy? we &s;at down to write in concert, or el&s;e &s;eparately, that we might afterwards compare our pro|ductions, choo&s;e the be&s;t, or compre&s;s them into one. If he had written homilies, I &s;hould have written homi|lies al&s;o. When he became mini&s;ter I did not interfere with his admini&s;tration; but if a circular letter, a &s;et of in&s;tructions, or an important &s;tate paper, were wanting, we talked the matter over with our u&s;ual freedom, and impre&s;&s;ed with his ideas, and pregnant with my own&punc; I took up the pen, which I had more lei&s;ure to conduct than he had.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="034483_0219_0FFDEA6E6FCCE870">OUR principles and our turn of mind being the &s;ame, we came to a final agreement as to the form, and my hu&s;band ran no ri&s;k in pa&s;&s;ing through my hands. I could advance nothing warranted by ju&s;tice or rea&s;on, which he was not capable of realizing, or &s;upporting by his energy and conduct; but my language expre&s;&s;ed more &s;trongly than his words, what he had done or what he promi&s;ed to do. Roland <HI>without me</HI> would not have been a wor&s;e mini&s;ter; his activity, and his knowledge, as well as his probity, were all his own; but <HI>with me</HI> he attracted more attention, becau&s;e I in|fu&s;ed into his writings that mixture of &s;pirit and of &s;oft|ne&s;s, of authoritative rea&s;on, and of &s;educing &s;entiment, which are perhaps only to be found in a woman en|dowed with a clear head and a feeling heart. I com|po&s;ed with delight &s;uch pieces as I deemed likely to be of u&s;e, and felt greater plea&s;ure in &s;o doing than if I had been known as the author. I am avaricious of happine&s;s: with me it con&s;i&s;ts in the good I do: I do not even &s;tand in need of glory; nor can I find any part in this world that &s;uits me, but that of Providence. I al|low the malicious to look upon this confe&s;&s;ion as a piece of impertinence which it mu&s;t &s;omewhat re&s;emble; tho&s;e who know me however will &s;ee nothing in it but what is &s;incere, like my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I RETURN to the letter, which was &s;ketched with a &s;troke of the pen, as was nearly the ca&s;e with every thing I did of the kind; for to feel the nece&s;&s;ity and propriety of a thing, to conceive its good effect, to de&s;ire to produce it, and to ca&s;t into the mould the

object from which that effect was to re&s;ult, were to me but one and the &s;ame operation. While we were reading over this letter together, who &s;hould be pre|&s;ent in my hu&s;band's clo&s;et, but that very <HI>Pache,</HI> who, before the expiration of the year, calumniated Roland, and now per&s;ecutes us, as the enemies of li|berty.&mdash;''Tis a very bold &s;tep,' &s;aid the hypocrite, whom I took for a &s;age.&mdash;'Very bold! without doubt, but ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary; what &s;ignifies any thing el&s;e?'&mdash; Roland repaired to the council, on the 10th of June, with the letter in his pocket, and with the de&s;ign of fir&s;t reading it aloud to his colleagues, and then putting it into the king's hands. The debate concerning the &s;anc|tioning of the two decrees began; but was &s;u&s;pended by the king, who told his mini&s;ters to have each his writ|ten opinion ready to deliver to him at the next meeting of the council. Roland could have delivered <HI>his</HI> with|out delay: he thought however, after what had ju&s;t been &s;aid, that it was incumbent on him to wait out of a &s;ort of regard to his colleagues; but on his return home we were of opinion, that he could not do better than di&s;patch his letter, to which he added three or four mi&s;&s;ive lines.</P>
<P>THE next day, at eight o'clock in the evening, I &s;aw Servan walk into my apartment with a joyful counte|nance. 'Congratulate me,' &s;aid he, 'I am turned out.' 'I am much mortified,' an&s;wered I, 'at your being the fir&s;t to have that honour; but I hope that, ere long, it will be awarded to my hu&s;band.'&mdash;Servan related to me that having been on bu&s;ine&s;s with the king in the morn|ing,
<PB N="21" REF="034483_0221_0FFDEA73CC021CA8">
he had endeavoured to &s;peak to him about the camp; that the king, with evident marks of ill hu|mour, had by turning his back upon him, put an end to the conver&s;ation; and that at the very in&s;tant Du|mouriez came up, in his maje&s;ty's name, to demand his <HI>port folio,</HI> of which he was going to take charge him&s;elf.&mdash;'Dumouriez? His conduct &s;urpri&s;es me little, but it is infamous, and the other mini&s;ters in that ca&s;e ought not to wait for their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. It would be|come them better to write to the king, that they can no longer &s;it at the council board with Dumouriez: we mu&s;t &s;end for them to con&s;ult about it.' Nobody but Claviere and Duranthon came, and they were peo|ple who never knew how to take a deci&s;ive mea&s;ure. It was agreed upon that they &s;hould return the next morning, after due deliberation, and that Roland &s;hould have a letter prepared for them all to &s;ign. At the &s;ame time he communicated to them the one which he had &s;ent in the morning, and from which he expected the &s;ame treatment as Servan had met with before.&mdash;I do not know whether, for that very rea&s;on, the&s;e gentle|men, who were fond of their places, might not ima|gine, that the two mini&s;ters the mo&s;t urgent for the decrees, would be the only ones &s;acrificed, and that they ought not to expo&s;e them&s;elves ra&s;hly to the &s;ame fate. The next morning they did not think proper to write, but deemed it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to go and &s;peak to the king in per&s;on; a mea&s;ure contrary to common &s;en&s;e; for when it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak plain truths to a per&s;on entitled by his &s;ituation to a great deal of re&s;pect,
<PB N="22" REF="034483_0222_0FFDEA76758FA798">
it is much more advantageous to do it by letter. Roland, who had fulfilled his ta&s;k, could do no more than join them upon this occa&s;ion; and they all repaired to La|co&s;te's, with the intention of a&s;king him to be of the party. Laco&s;te was doubtful, and appeared to he&s;itate, when a me&s;&s;enger from the king brought Duranthon an order to go immediately, and alone, to the palace.&mdash; 'We will go and wait for you at your own hou&s;e,' &s;aid Claviere and Roland.&mdash;Scarcely had they reached the palace of ju&s;tice, when Duranthon returned with a long face, and a hypocritical look; and drew &s;lowly out of his pocket what was called a <HI>lettre de cachet,</HI> containing the di&s;charge of his two colleagues. 'You make us wait a long while for our liberty,' &s;aid Roland, taking the paper with a &s;mile. 'Ay, our liberty is here in|deed.'&mdash;He returned home, and brought me the intelli|gence, for which I was well prepared. 'One thing re|mains to be done,' &s;aid I, with animation; 'and that is, to be the fir&s;t to acquaint the a&s;&s;embly with your di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, &s;ending them at the &s;ame time a copy of your letter to the king, by which it has certainly been occa|&s;ioned.' This idea plea&s;ed him much, and we put it immediately into execution.&mdash;I fore&s;aw that it would have a great effect; nor was I deceived: it an&s;wered a double purpo&s;e; <HI>utility</HI> and <HI>glory</HI> were the con&s;equences of my hu&s;band's retreat. I had not been proud of his elevation to the mini&s;try, but I was proud of his di&s;grace.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid that Dumouriez had a little affront to revenge by entering into a league with the court again&s;t his colleagues. The circum&s;tance that gave ri&s;e to it was as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="034483_0223_0FFDEA7923D172E8">BONNE-CARRERE, a hand&s;ome man, who had the reputation and manners of an intriguer, and who owed the cro&s;s of St. Lewis which decorated his per&s;on to the intere&s;t of Dumouriez, was cho&s;en by the latter for his principal agent, and appointed director general of the department of foreign affairs.</P>
<P>I SAW him once only, when Dumouriez brought him to dine with me; and was as little impo&s;ed upon by his agreeable out&s;ide as by that of Herault de Sechelles. 'All the&s;e hand&s;ome fellows,' &s;aid I to a friend, '&s;eem to me to be but poor patriots; they appear too fond of them&s;elves not to prefer their own pretty per&s;ons to the public good; nor can I ever help being tempted to lower their conceit, by affecting to be blind to the ad|vantage on which they pride them&s;elves the mo&s;t.'</P>
<P>I MORE than once heard grave men, members of the legi&s;lature, &s;ome of tho&s;e noble originals who kept ho|nour and probity alive, and who are now declared in|famous on that account; I heard them lament the choice that Dumouriez had made, and contend that patriotic mini&s;ters, to give &s;trength to the cau&s;e of liberty, &s;hould be particularly careful to commit every part of the ad|mini&s;tration to the pure&s;t hands. I know that Dumou|riez was mildly remon&s;trated with, and that he urged in excu&s;e the under&s;tanding and talents of Bonne-Carrere, to whom wit, ver&s;atility, and a mind fertile in re&s;ources, could not be denied; but a rumour got abroad of an affair managed by Bonne-Carrere, on account of which a hundred thou&s;and livres had been depo&s;ited in a no|tary's hands. A part of it was intended for madam de
<PB N="24" REF="034483_0224_0FFDEA7BD810C828">
Beauvart. This lady was Dumouriez's mi&s;tre&s;s, a wo|man of ea&s;y virtue, and &s;i&s;ter to Rivarol, living in the mid&s;t of people of di&s;&s;olute manners, and di&s;gu&s;ting ari|&s;tocracy. I have forgot the nature of the affair, and the parties; but the names, the dates, and the particulars, were known, and the fact was undoubted. It was agreed that Dumouriez &s;hould be &s;eriou&s;ly reque&s;ted to di&s;mi&s;s Bonne-Carrere, and to pre&s;erve, or to put on a decency of demeanor, without which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to remain in the mini&s;try, and to avoid injury to the good cau&s;e. Gen&s;onn&eacute;, who was intimately acquainted with Dumouriez; and Bri&s;&s;ot, to whom all Bonne-Car|rere's tricks had been denounced, determined to &s;peak to him at Roland's, in his pre&s;ence, and in that of three or four other per&s;ons, either his colleagues, or members of the legi&s;lative body. Accordingly, after dining at my table, and returning into the room which I generally in|habited, the grievance was &s;et forth, and the ob&s;erva|tions it warranted, were made to Dumouriez. Roland, with all the gravity of his age and character, took the liberty of in&s;i&s;ting upon the matter, as intere&s;ting to the whole mini&s;try. Nothing being le&s;s agreeable to Du|mouriez than this preci&s;ion, and the tone of remon|&s;trance, he endeavoured at fir&s;t to give the &s;ubject a light turn; but finding him&s;elf hard pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ober ar|gument, he grew angry, and took leave with an air of di&s;content. From that day he cea&s;ed to vi&s;it the mem|bers of the a&s;&s;embly, and did not &s;eem &s;atisfied when he met them at my hou&s;e, whither he came much le&s;s fre|quently than before. Reflecting upon this conduct, I
<PB N="25" REF="034483_0225_0FFDEA7FA29A69E8">
told Roland, 'that, without pretending to be ver&s;ed in intrigue, I believed, according to the practice of the world, the hour of ruining Dumouriez was at hand, if he did not wi&s;h to be overturned him&s;elf. 'I know very well,' added I, 'that you will not de&s;cend to &s;uch manoeuvres; but it is not the le&s;s true, that Dumouriez will certainly endeavour to get rid of tho&s;e by who&s;e cen&s;ure he has been offended. When a man once be|gins to read lectures, and does it to no purpo&s;e, he mu&s;t puni&s;h, or expect to be mole&s;ted.' Dumouriez, who was partial to Bonne-Carrere, made him his confident as far as he was per&s;onally concerned; and Bonne-Carrere, who had exce&s;s to the queen by means of &s;everal women with whom he was connected, found means to hu&s;h up the di&s;graceful &s;tory. Intrigues were &s;et on foot; the famous decrees followed; and although Dumou|riez was for giving them the royal a&s;&s;ent; he contrived to keep in favour at court, and was of u&s;e, after the departure of his colleagues, either by propo&s;ing &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, or by accepting the war department; though, by the way, he did not keep it long; for the court, which at fir&s;t had been glad to retain him, that they might not appear to di&s;mi&s;s all the mini&s;ters denominated patriots at once, got rid of him &s;oon after. But he was too dex|terous not to avoid a total di&s;grace, and obtained em|ployment in the army conformable to his rank.</P>
<P>EVEN the patriots imagined it was advi&s;able to turn his talents to account, and were in hopes that he would make a good u&s;e of them in his military career. &mdash;One of the principal difficulties that embarra&s;&s;ed go|vernment, after the 10th of Augu&s;t, was to find per&s;ons
<PB N="26" REF="034483_0226_0FFDEA81301B4AD8">
fit to fill public employs, particularly in that line. The old government had conferred the rank of officer upon none but nobles; and knowledge and experience were concentrated in their order; but the people were unea&s;y at &s;eeing them intru&s;ted with the conduct of the forces intended to &s;upport a con&s;titution adver&s;e to their in|tere&s;t. Struck with this contra&s;t, they could not, like the enlightened part of mankind, judge of the rea&s;ons of confidence, founded on one man's di&s;po&s;ition, on the pa&s;&s;ions of another, and on the principles of a third. Their flatterers, on the contrary, aggravated their fears, and excited their di&s;tru&s;t: everla&s;ting denunciators, they &s;et them&s;elves up as enemies to every man in place, that they might e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in tho&s;e places which be&s;t &s;uited their ambition: &s;uch is the &s;y&s;tem of all agitators, from Hippo, the orator of Syracu&s;e, to Robe&s;pierre, the <HI>&s;peechifier</HI> of Paris.</P>
<P>ROLAND, recalled to the mini&s;try, thought that the public good, and the circum&s;tances of the times, made it hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> duty to do away all idea of oppo&s;ition between Du|mouriez and him&s;elf, &s;ince each was &s;erving the repub|lic in his way.

<Q>are as uncertain as in war; <HI>I</HI> am again in the executive council; <HI>you</HI> are at the head of an army: you have the errors of your admini&s;tration to efface from the public mind, and laurels to gather in the field of Mars!

you are not unlike tho&s;e valorous knights, who were every now and then guilty of little rogui&s;h tricks, at which they were the fir&s;t to laugh them&s;elves; but who fought neverthele&s;s like furies, when their ho|nour was at &s;take. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that this character does not very well accord with republican au&s;terity: it is the con&s;equence of tho&s;e manners, which we have not yet been able to throw off, and for which you will be &s;ure of a pardon, if you beat the enemy. You will find me in the council ever ready to &s;econd your enterpri&s;es as long as they have the public welfare in view. Where that is concerned I am a &s;tranger to all favour and affection; and &s;hall look up to you as to one of the &s;aviours of my coun|try, provided you devote your&s;elf &s;incerely to its de|fence.</Q>
&mdash;Dumouriez's an&s;wer was &s;pirited, and his conduct no le&s;s &s;o&mdash;he repul&s;ed the Pru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER at this period, &s;ome hopes were en|tertained of detaching them from the league, and &s;ome overtures made in con&s;equence; but they led to nothing. He came to Paris after the enemy had evacuated our territory, to concert the plan of his Belgic campaign. Roland &s;aw him at the council chamber, and once he came to dine at our hou&s;e, with &s;everal other gue&s;ts. When he entered the room, he appeared a little embarra&s;&s;ed, and offered me a beautiful bouquet which he had in his hand, with &s;omewhat of an awk|ward air for a man of &s;o much a&s;&s;urance. I &s;miled, and told him, that the tricks of fortune were whim&s;ical enough; and that doubtle&s;s he never expected &s;he
<PB N="28" REF="034483_0228_0FFDEA87A3297ED0">
would enable me to receive him again in that hotel; but flowers did not the le&s;s become the conqueror of the Pru&s;&s;ians, and that I received them with plea&s;ure from his hand. After dinner he propo&s;ed going to the opera. That, again, was a remnant of the old folly of our generals, who&s;e cu&s;tom it was to &s;hew them|&s;elves at the playhou&s;e, and &s;eek theatrical crowns whenever they had obtained an advantage over the enemy. Somebody a&s;ked me if I did not intend to be there; but I declined giving an an&s;wer, becau&s;e it was neither con&s;i&s;tent with my character nor my manners to appear in public with Dumouriez. When the company was gone, however, I propo&s;ed to Vergniaux to take a &s;eat in my box, in company with my daughter and my&s;elf. We went thither, and were told by the a&s;to|ni&s;hed box-keeper that the mini&s;ter's box was full. 'That is impo&s;&s;ible', &s;aid I; for nobody could go into it without a ticket &s;igned by him, and I had not given a &s;ingle one away.&mdash;'But it is the mini&s;ter him&s;elf, and he in&s;i&s;ted upon admi&s;&s;ion.'&mdash;'No, that cannot be: open the door, and I &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee who it is.' two or three <HI>&s;ans-culottes,</HI> in the &s;hape of bullies, were &s;tanding in the lobby. 'Don't open the door,' cried they, 'the mi|ni&s;ter is there.'&mdash;'I cannot help it,' an&s;wered the wo|man, who in&s;tantly obeyed me; and there I di&s;covered Danton's broad face, that of Fabre, and two or three women of &s;u&s;picious appearance. The opera was be|gun; their eyes were turned upon the &s;tage; and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ton was leaning over towards the next box to &s;peak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Dumouriez, whom I recognized immediately.

<PB N="29" REF="034483_0229_10019D549090D070">
I &s;aw at a &s;ingle glance, without being perceived by any body in the box, and pu&s;hing the door to, made a ha&s;ty retreat. 'Why, indeed,' &s;aid I to the box-keeper, 'a certain <HI>ci-devant</HI> mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice is there, whom I would rather leave to enjoy the fruits of his imperti|nence, than enter into any altercation with him: I have nothing to do here.' On &s;aying this, I retired, well plea&s;ed upon the whole that Danton's folly had &s;aved me from the incongruity I wi&s;hed to avoid of appearing in public with Dumouriez, who&s;e &s;eat would have been &s;o very near to mine. I afterwards heard that Danton and Fabre con&s;tantly attended him to all the other theatres, where he was weak enough to &s;hew him&s;elf. As to me, I have never &s;een him &s;ince. This, then, is the whole of our connection with a man who&s;e accomplices people were plea&s;ed to &s;uppo&s;e us at the time of his treachery. Dumouriez is active, vigilant, witty, and brave; calcu|lated alike for war and for intrigue. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great military talents, he was the only man in France, in the opinion even of his jealous competitors, able to com|mand a large army properly; but he was better fitted by his ver&s;atile di&s;po&s;ition, and by his di&s;&s;olute morals, to &s;erve under the old court, than under the new go|vernment. His exten&s;ive views, and the &s;pirit with which he pur&s;ues them, render him capable of forming va&s;t projects; nor does he want abilities to carry them into execution; but his temper is not equal to his un|der&s;tanding, and his impatience and impetuo&s;ity hurry him into mea&s;ures precipitate or indi&s;creet. He is excellent at devi&s;ing a &s;tratagem; but incapable of
<PB N="30" REF="034483_0230_0FFDEA892E4419D8">
concealing his purpo&s;e for any length of time. Du|mouriez, in &s;hort, to become the leader of a party wanted a cooler head.</P>
<P>I AM per&s;uaded he did not go to the Belgic pro|vinces with treacherous intentions; he would have &s;erved the republic as he had &s;erved the king, provided it had tended to his glory and advantage; but the injudicious decrees pa&s;&s;ed by the convention, the infamous conduct of its commi&s;&s;aries, and the blunders of the executive power, ruining our cau&s;e in that country, and the a&s;pect of affairs threatening a general convul&s;ion, he conceived the idea of giving them a turn, and for want of temper and prudence bewildered him&s;elf in his combinations. Dumouriez mu&s;t be very amiable in orgies of his own &s;ex, and agreeable to women of di&s;&s;olute manners: he appears to have &s;till all the &s;prightline&s;s of youth, and all the gaity of a lively and free imagination; but with women of a re&s;erved di&s;po&s;ition there is &s;omething formal in his politene&s;s. He u&s;ed to divert the king in council by the mo&s;t extravagant &s;tories, at which his grave colleagues could not help laughing; and not un|frequently he &s;ea&s;oned them with truths equally bold and well applied. What a difference between this man, vicious as he is, and Lukner, who at one time was the only hope of France! Never did I meet with any thing &s;o contemptible. He was an old &s;oldier, half <HI>brutified,</HI> wanting in common &s;en&s;e, and de&s;titute of all energy of mind; a mere phantom of a man, who, by means of his broken French, his fondne&s;s for wine, a few oaths, and a kind of intrepidity, had acquired great popularity

in the army, among mercenary machines, ever the dupes of any one who taps them on the &s;houlder, &s;peaks to them with familiarity, and puni&s;hes them from time to time.

<P>I AM perfectly ignorant of tactics, and Lukner, for aught I know, might under&s;tand the routine of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion; but I am well a&s;&s;ured that no man can be a great general without good &s;en&s;e and rationality.</P>
<P>THE thing which &s;urpri&s;ed me the mo&s;t, after my hu&s;band's elevation had given me an opportunity of being acquainted with a great number of per&s;ons, par|ticularly of tho&s;e employed in important affairs, was the univer&s;al meanne&s;s of their minds: it &s;urpa&s;&s;es every thing that can be imagined, and extends to every rank, from the clerk, who &s;tands in need of nothing but &s;en&s;e to comprehend a plain que&s;tion, method to treat it, and a decent &s;tyle to draw up a letter to the mini&s;ter charged with the government, the general at the head of armies, and the amba&s;&s;ador employed to protect the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate. But for that experience, never &s;hould I have thought &s;o poorly of my &s;pecies; nor was it till that period that I a&s;&s;umed any confidence in my|&s;elf: till then I was as ba&s;hful as a boarder in a con|vent, and thought people who had more a&s;&s;urance than my&s;elf, had more abilities al&s;o.&mdash;I no longer won|der, indeed that I was a favourite: my friends per|ceived I was not without my &s;hare of merit, and

yet I &s;incerely did homage to other people's vanity.&mdash; In this &s;carcity of men of abilities, the revolution having &s;ucce&s;&s;ively driven away tho&s;e who&s;e birth, fortune, edu|cation, and circum&s;tances, had rendered them &s;uperior to the ma&s;s of the people by a &s;omewhat higher degree of cultivation, it is no wonder if we fell gradually into the hands of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance, and mo&s;t &s;hameful incapacity. There are a great many degrees between de Grave and Bouchotte. The former was a little man, whom nature had made gentle, who&s;e prejudices in&s;pired him with pride, and who&s;e heart per&s;uaded him to be amiable; but who, for want of knowing how to reconcile tho&s;e various affections; at la&s;t became nothing at all. I think I &s;ee him now, walking upon his heels, with his elbows turned out, and his head erect, very often &s;hewing nothing but the whites of his great blue eyes, which he could not keep open after dinner without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two or three cups of coffee; &s;peaking little, as if out of di&s;cretion, but in reality for fear of expo&s;ing him&s;elf; and truly anxious about his official concerns, but di&s;tracted by their multiplicity. The con&s;equence was, that at la&s;t he abandoned a place for which he felt him&s;elf unfit. I will &s;ay nothing of Bou|chotte; an idiot is de&s;cribed in three &s;yllables; but his faults were innumerable. Of Servan I have &s;poken el&s;ewhere; a brave &s;oldier, an excellent citizen, and a man of information, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a degree of merit &s;eldom to be met with: the world would be too happy if there were many men of that character.

common among people, who pa&s;&s;ing much of their time in their clo&s;ets, form opinions there, which they after|wards maintain with ob&s;tinacy, was neither deficient in knowledge nor philo&s;ophy; but financial habits had in &s;ome mea&s;ure narrowed his mind. Pecuniary calcula|tions indeed always &s;poil the happie&s;t di&s;po&s;itions; for it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man not to &s;et a high value upon that which con&s;titutes his daily occupation. A banker may be an able and well-informed man; but he will never number the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of Ari&s;tides among his vir|tues. Claviere is very laborious, ea&s;y to be led by tho&s;e who know his weak &s;ide, but in&s;upportable in his commerce with any body who partakes of his own ob|&s;tinacy in di&s;pute; a bad judge of mankind, of whom he never &s;tudied but one part, their under&s;tandings, without attending to their di&s;po&s;itions, their intere&s;ts, and their pa&s;&s;ions; timid in council, although &s;ometimes carried away by the warmth of his temper; in a word, he is rather a good admini&s;trator than an able mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>I NEVER yet could under&s;tand what it was that pro|moted Duranthon to a place in the admini&s;tration, un|le&s;s indeed it were the idea of the little ability nece&s;&s;ary to fill that of mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice. Heavy, &s;lothful, vain, and talkative, timid and confined in his notions, he was in truth no better than an old woman. His reputation for integrity, the &s;ober manners of a decent advocate, a few te&s;timonies of attachment to the revolution, and the age of experience, probably &s;erved him as a recom|mendation; but he had not even &s;en&s;e enough to make a &s;ea&s;onable retreat, the only mea&s;ure by which he could
<PB N="34" REF="034483_0234_0FFDEA8E8A69A258">
have acquired a portion of glory. When I recollect what kind of men he has had for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, I am le&s;s angry with tho&s;e who thought him worthy of his place; but I cannot help a&s;king my&s;elf where we are to &s;eek for men qualified to hold the reins of government.</P>
<P>LACOSTE had the official knowledge, the laborious habits, and the in&s;ignificance of a clerk. Having been long employed in the admiralty-office <HI>(Bureaux de la marine),</HI> he was thought fit to be put at the head of that department, in which he committed no blunders. But he was de&s;titute of the capacity and activity which ought to characterize the admini&s;trator of &s;o con&s;iderable a branch of the public bu&s;ine&s;s, and his want of them was expo&s;ed by the exigencies of the times. Nothing &s;hort of the inability of Monge, could have afforded an advan|tageous object of compari&s;on for Laco&s;te.&mdash;Beneath the ma&s;k of a countenance almo&s;t indicating timidity, the lat|ter concealed an irritable di&s;po&s;ition, which, in ca&s;e of con|tradiction, degenerated into the mo&s;t ridiculous violence.</P>
<P>SUCH was the compo&s;ition of the mini&s;try the fir&s;t time that Roland belonged to it. There prevailed, in the beginning, a great union between the members of the council; and I verily believe they were all &s;incerely attached to the con&s;titution, with more or le&s;s of regard to their own intere&s;t on the part of &s;everal. As they a&s;&s;embled at each other's hou&s;es on the days the council met, I had them to dine with me once a week. Some of the members of the legi&s;lative body were al&s;o invited; and the conver&s;ation u&s;ed to turn on the affairs of the nation, with a common de&s;ire of promoting the public good.

<HEAD>ROLAND's SECOND ADMINISTRATION.</HEAD>
<P>AT the time of the recal of Roland, Claviere, and Servan, the compo&s;ition of the mini&s;try was completed by the appointment of Danton, whom I have &s;ufficiently depicted el&s;ewhere, and by that of Monge and le Brun; the former to the marine department, the latter to that of foreign affairs. Nothing is &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as the diffi|culty of making a choice in circum&s;tances like tho&s;e of the times in que&s;tion. Every man who had belonged to the court, directly or indirectly, was pro&s;cribed by pub|lic opinion; nor could any thing &s;hort of the brilliant proofs of patrioti&s;m given by Servan, efface that original &s;in, even &s;mall as it was in regard to him. The per&s;ons employed to make a choice were ill calculated to do &s;o. New them&s;elves to public affairs, our legi&s;lators could not boa&s;t of tho&s;e exten&s;ive connections which lead to an acquaintance with a great number of individuals, and enable a man to &s;elect from them the per&s;ons be&s;t fitted for important employments. The committee was puzzled to make a choice, when the idea of Monge, who was known to Condorcet as a fellow academician, and of who&s;e patrioti&s;m &s;everal others had heard favour|able mention, pre&s;ented it&s;elf. Monge, a mathemati|cian, &s;ometimes &s;ent to examine officers at the out-ports, an hone&s;t citizen, the father of a re&s;pectable family, and a zealous member of the club of the Luxemburg, was for a moment weighed in the &s;cale again&s;t Meunier, his colleague at the academy, and an officer of engineers;
<PB N="36" REF="034483_0236_0FFDEA9140B79FD0">
but as the latter was known to have paid his court to the great, Monge was preferred.</P>
<P>GOOD-HUMOURED, thick-witted, and inclined to buf|foonery, Monge was a &s;tone-cutter at Mezieres, where the Abbe Bo&s;&s;ut, perceiving him to have a turn for the mathematics, initiated him in that &s;cience, and encou|raged him by a donation of &s;ix livres a week: but when by application he had got forward in the world, he cea&s;ed to vi&s;it his benefactor, con&s;idering him&s;elf as his equal. Accu&s;tomed to calculate immutable elements, Monge was de&s;titute of all knowledge of the world, or of public affairs: heavy and awkward in his plea&s;antry, he recalled to my recollection, in his clum&s;y attempts at wit, the bears kept in the ditches of the city of Berne, who&s;e playful tricks, corre&s;ponding with their uncouth forms, amu&s;e the pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>THE new mini&s;ter filled his office with men as little capable of acting as he was of judging: he took great pains without doing any good, and &s;uffered the ma|rine to be di&s;organized at a time when it was mo&s;t important to keep up, and even to increa&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. Prai&s;e, however, is due to the goodne&s;s of his intentions: he was frightened at the burthen, and wi&s;hed to lay it down; but the difficulty of finding a better man, procured him an invitation to remain at his po&s;t. By degrees his duty came to &s;it ea&s;y on him, and he fancied that he did it as well as it could have been done by any body el&s;e. But though a bad admini&s;trator, he was &s;till wor&s;e as a coun&s;ellor, and &s;erved only to fill a chair during the debates of the executive power, con|curring
<PB N="37" REF="034483_0237_0FFDEA93EF647DF8">
con&s;tantly in &s;entiment with the mo&s;t timid, becau&s;e having none of his own, he naturally followed that which was mo&s;t conformable to the views of a narrow mind.</P>
<P>WHEN Pache was promoted to the mini&s;try, he be|came the oracle of his friend and admirer Monge, who was no longer of any opinion but his, and received it as if it had been the in&s;piration of the divinity. Thus was he <HI>Maratized;</HI> and thus did this man, who was de&s;|tined by nature to play a better part, become the abet|tor of the mo&s;t atrocious and &s;anguinary doctrines.</P>
<P>LE BRUN, employed in the office of foreign affairs, pa&s;&s;ed for a man of &s;ound under&s;tanding, becau&s;e he never had any flights of fancy, and for a man of abili|ties, becau&s;e he had been a tolerable clerk. He was tolerably acquainted with the diplomatic chart, and could draw up a &s;en&s;ible letter or report. In ordinary times, he would have done very well for the depart|ment which is the lea&s;t laborious, and where the bu&s;i|ne&s;s is of the mo&s;t agreeable kind. But he had none of that activity of mind and di&s;po&s;ition, which it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to di&s;play at the moment he was called to the mini&s;try. Ill-informed of what was going on among our neighbours, and &s;ending mini&s;ters to foreign courts, who although not de&s;titute of merit, had none of tho&s;e qualities which &s;erve to recommend a man, and who could hardly penetrate farther than the anti-chambers of the great; he neither made u&s;e of that kind of intrigue, by which employment might have been found at home for tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to attack us, nor of that kind of
<PB N="38" REF="034483_0238_0FFDEAACC433F550">
dignity with which a powerful &s;tate ought to inve&s;t its acknowledged agents in order to procure it&s;elf re&s;pect&mdash; 'What are you about?' Roland &s;ometimes u&s;ed to &s;ay. 'In your place, I would have put all Europe in motion, and have in&s;ured peace to France, without the aid of arms; I would take care to know what is going on in every cabinet, and exert my influence there.' Le Brun was never in a hurry; and now, in Augu&s;t 1793, Semonville, who ought to have been at Con&s;tantinople eight months ago, has ju&s;t been intercepted in his way through Switzerland. The la&s;t choice of Le Brun will &s;erve to characterize him completely, without my add|ing another trait. He has appointed Grouvelle, the &s;e|cretary to the council, of whom in that quality I ought already to have &s;poken, mini&s;ter plenipotentiary at the court of Denmark.</P>
<P>GROUVELLE, a pupil of Cerutti, of whom he learned nothing but to con&s;truct affected phra&s;es, which contain the whole of his philo&s;ophy; narrow-minded, frigid, and vain, the la&s;t editor of the <HI>Feuille Villageoi&s;e,</HI> be|come as flat as him&s;elf; Grouvelle had been candidate for &s;ome place or other in the mini&s;try, and was ap|pointed &s;ecretary to the council on the tenth of Augu&s;t, according to a con&s;titutional law, again&s;t the di&s;re|gard of which Roland had remon&s;trated with &s;o much warmth, that the king had at la&s;t determined to attend to it. Roland was in hopes that the keeping of a re|gular regi&s;ter, in which an entry might be made of the debates, would give to the proceedings of the council a more &s;erious, as well as a more u&s;eful turn:
<PB N="39" REF="034483_0239_0FFDEA96A8D2ED80">
he perceived be&s;ides, that it would afford to men po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a firm temper of mind an opportunity of au|thenticating their opinions, and of &s;ecuring a te&s;timony &s;ometimes u&s;eful to hi&s;tory, and always nece&s;&s;ary to their own ju&s;tification. But the be&s;t in&s;titutions are only ad|vantageous when in the hands of people incapable of perverting them. Grouvelle did not know how to take minutes of the proceedings, and the mini&s;ters, for the mo&s;t part, cared little whether any traces of their opinion remained. The &s;ecretary was never able to do more than draw up a &s;ummary of the re&s;olu|tions taken, without the a&s;&s;ignment of any rea&s;ons, or the mention of any oppo&s;ition; nor could Roland ever find means to get his objections in&s;erted, even when he formally re&s;i&s;ted the re&s;olution of the council. Grouvelle con&s;tantly interfered in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and by his captious manner contributed not a little to ren|der it perplexing, till Roland, out of all patience, ob|&s;erved to him one day that he did not recollect his bu|&s;ine&s;s there.&mdash;'What, am I nothing but an ink-horn!' exclaimed the important &s;ecretary in an angry tone.&mdash; 'You ought to be nothing el&s;e here,' replied the &s;e|vere Roland; 'every time you interfere in the debate you forget your duty, which is to take it down; and this is the rea&s;on why you have only time to make a little in&s;ignificant &s;tatement upon a loo&s;e &s;heet of paper, which, when entered in the regi&s;ter, gives not the &s;malle&s;t idea of the operations of government; whereas the re|gi&s;ter of the council ought to &s;erve as archives to the executive power.'&mdash;Grouvelle was much incen&s;ed,
<PB N="40" REF="034483_0240_0FFDEA995E2E2E58">
but he neither improved nor altered his method, which, as my reader will ea&s;ily perceive, was quite good enough for &s;uch men as I have de&s;cribed above. The &s;alary of his place was twenty thou&s;and livres (&pound;833), to which he thought it would be convenient to add an apartment in the Louvre, &s;pacious enough to lodge him&s;elf and his clerks, and made his repre&s;entation to the mini|&s;ter of the home department accordingly. It requires but little knowledge of Roland's character to conceive the indignation with which he received this propo&s;al, and the vigour with which he repelled it. 'Clerks! &s;aid he, for bu&s;ine&s;s that I could tran&s;act my&s;elf in a few hours, and better than you if I were in your place.&mdash;I de|&s;ire that you will take a copyi&s;t to &s;ave you the trouble of delivering &s;uch copies or extracts of the proceedings as you may be called upon to furni&s;h; but twenty thou|&s;and livres are quite &s;ufficient to pay his &s;alary, and to find a lodging for him as well as for your&s;elf: the &s;um is even extravagant, in a free government, for the place you occupy.'</P>
<P>GROUVELLE certainly has a right not to be fond of Ro|land, and I believe that he exerci&s;es it to its full extent.</P>
<P>As to me, I felt in the mo&s;t lively manner, that his ridiculous preten&s;ions were intolerable.&mdash;The&s;e men, made up of vanity, who&s;e wit is a mere jargon, who&s;e philo&s;ophy is pitiable o&s;tentation, and who&s;e &s;entiments are recollections, appear to me a kind of eunuchs, in a moral &s;en&s;e, whom I de&s;pi&s;e and dete&s;t more cordially than &s;ome women hate and di&s;dain tho&s;e creatures. Such, however, is the mini&s;ter of a great nation at a foreign

court, of which it is important to pre&s;erve the e&s;tee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;ecure the neutrality. I am unacquainted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ecret of his appointment; but I would wager t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Grouvelle, half-dead with fear, on &s;eeing the di&s;a&s;trous po&s;ition of public affairs, reque&s;ted le Brun to get him &s;ent out of France in any way whatever; and that le Brun, in quality of mini&s;ter, made him amba&s;&s;ador, as he would have made him a travelling-clerk, if he him&s;elf had been a merchant. It is an arrangement be|tween individual and individual, in which the republic is no otherwi&s;e concerned than in conferring the title, and advantages attached to it, and in receiving the injury that may ari&s;e from being &s;o badly repre|&s;ented.</P>
<P>THE choice of an envoy to the United States was con|ducted with more wi&s;dom; and affords a new argu|ment in favour of Bri&s;&s;ot, again&s;t whom the &s;hare he had in it is brought forward as a crime. Bonne-Car|rere having been fixed upon, I know not at what pe|riod, Bri&s;&s;ot ob&s;erved to &s;everal members of the coun|cil, that it was of con&s;equence to the maintenance of our good under&s;tanding with the United States, as well as to the glory of our infant republic, to &s;end to America a man, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition and manners might be agreeable to the Americans. In that re&s;pect Bonne-Carrere was not a &s;uitable per&s;on: an amiable libertine of the fa&s;hionable world, and a game&s;ter, whatever might be his talents and abilities, was very unfit to play the grave and decent part becoming a mini&s;ter re&s;ident with that tran&s;atlantic nation.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="034483_0242_0FFDEAA9E6085018">BRISSOT was actuated by no per&s;onal intere&s;t; he was the la&s;t man in the world to be &s;o influenced: he men|tioned Genet, who was ju&s;t returned from a re&s;idence of five years in Ru&s;&s;ia, and who, be&s;ides his being al|ready conver&s;ant with diplomatic affairs, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the moral virtues, and all the information, that could render him agreeable to a &s;erious people.</P>
<P>THAT propo&s;al was wi&s;e; it was &s;upported by every po&s;&s;ible con&s;ideration; and Genet was preferred. If this be an intrigue, let us pray that all intriguers may re&s;emble Bri&s;&s;ot. I &s;aw Genet, I de&s;ired to &s;ee him again, and &s;hould always be delighted with his company. His judgment is &s;olid, and his mind en|lightened: he has as much amenity as decency of man|ners; his conver&s;ation is in&s;tructive and agreeable, and equally free from pedantry and from affectation: gentle|ne&s;s, propriety, grace, and rea&s;on, are his characteri&s;tics; and with all this merit he unites the advantage of &s;peak|ing Engli&s;h with fluency. Let the ignorant Robe&s;pierre, and the extravagant Chabot, declaim again&s;t &s;uch a man, by calling him the friend of Bri&s;&s;ot; let them procure by their clamours, the recall of the one, and the trial of the other: they will only add to the proofs of their own villainy and &s;tupidity, without hurting the fame of tho&s;e whom they may find means to deprive of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>DURING Roland's &s;econd admini&s;tration, as well as the fir&s;t, I determined to receive no female, and that was a rule to which I &s;crupulou&s;ly adhered. My circle was never very exten&s;ive, and never did the greater part of it con&s;i&s;t of my own &s;ex. Be&s;ides my neare&s;t rela|tions,
<PB N="43" REF="034483_0243_0FFDEA9EB78731D8">
I &s;aw nobody but the per&s;ons who&s;e congenial ta&s;te and &s;tudies gave them claims to my hu&s;band's at|tention. I was &s;en&s;ible that while he was in the mini&s;|try, I &s;hould expo&s;e my&s;elf to very trouble&s;ome com|pany;&mdash;to company that might even be attended with danger. It appeared to me that madame P&eacute;tion's con|duct at the <HI>Mairie</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The re&s;idence of the mayor.</NOTE> was highly prudent; and I deemed it as laudable to follow, as to &s;et, a good example. Ac|cordingly I had neither circle nor vi&s;its: that, in the fir&s;t place, was a great economy of time, an ine&s;timable ad|vantage to tho&s;e who have the means of turning it to any account. Twice a week only I gave a dinner: once to my hu&s;band's colleagues, with a few members of the A&s;&s;embly; and once to a mixed company, compo&s;ed either of national repre&s;entatives, of fir&s;t clerks in the public offices, or of &s;uch other per&s;ons as took a part in politics, or were concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate. Ta&s;te and neatne&s;s pre&s;ided at my table, but pro|fu&s;ion and the luxury of ornaments were equally un|known: every one was there at his ea&s;e, without devot|ing much time to conviviality, becau&s;e I gave only a &s;ingle cour&s;e, and relinqui&s;hed to nobody the care of doing the honours of the table. The u&s;ual number of gue&s;ts was fifteen; it &s;eldom exceeded eighteen; and once only amounted to twenty. Such were the repa&s;ts which popular orators in the ro&s;trum of the Jacobins, converted into &s;umptuous entertainments, where, like another Circe, I corrupted all tho&s;e who had the mi&s;|fortune
<PB N="44" REF="034483_0244_0FFDEAA19CBFDD00">
to partake of the banquet. After dinner, we conver&s;ed for &s;ome time in the drawing-room, and then every one took leave. We &s;at down to table about five; at nine not a creature remained; and yet that was the court, of which they made me the queen, and there, with the doors wide open, did we carry on our dark and dangerous con&s;piracies.</P>
<P>THE other days, confined to our family, my hu&s;band and my&s;elf generally &s;at down to the table alone; for the tran&s;action of the public bu&s;ine&s;s delaying our dinner to a very late hour, my daughter dined with her governe&s;s in her own room. Tho&s;e who &s;aw me at that time, will bear witne&s;s in my favour, whenever the voice of truth can make it&s;elf heard: I &s;hall then perhaps be no more: but I &s;hall go out of this world with the per&s;ua|&s;ion, that the memory of my per&s;ecutors will be lo&s;t in maledictions, while my name will &s;ometimes be recollected with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>AMONG the per&s;ons whom I was in the habit of re|ceiving, and of whom I have already de&s;cribed the mo&s;t remarkable, <HI>Paine</HI> de&s;erves to be mentioned. Declared a French citizen, as one of tho&s;e celebrated foreigners, whom the nation was naturally de&s;irous of adopting, he was known by writings which had been u&s;eful in the American revolution, and which might have contri|buted to produce one in England. I &s;hall not, however, take upon me to pronounce an ab&s;olute judgment upon his character, becau&s;e he under&s;tood French without &s;peaking it, and becau&s;e that being nearly my ca&s;e in re|gard to the Engli&s;h language, I was le&s;s able to conver&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="034483_0245_0FFDEAA4895720E8">
with him than to li&s;ten to his conver&s;ation with tho&s;e who&s;e political &s;kill was greater than my own.</P>
<P>THE boldne&s;s of his conceptions, the originality of his &s;tyle, and the &s;triking truths which he throws with defiance into the mid&s;t of tho&s;e whom they offend, have nece&s;&s;arily attracted great attention; but I think him better fitted to &s;ow the &s;eeds of popular commotion, than to lay the foundation or prepare the form of a govern|ment. Paine throws light upon a revolution better than he concurs in the making of a con&s;titution. He takes up, and e&s;tabli&s;hes tho&s;e great principles, of which the expo&s;ition &s;trikes every eye, gains the applau&s;e of a club, or excites the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a tavern; but for cool di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in a committee, or the regular labours of a legi&s;lator, I conceive <HI>David Williams</HI> infinitely more pro|per than Paine. Williams, made a French citizen al&s;o, was not cho&s;en a member of the convention, in which he would have been of more u&s;e; but was invited by the government to repair to Paris, where he pa&s;&s;ed &s;e|veral months, and frequently conferred with the mo&s;t active repre&s;entatives of the nation. A profound thinker, and a real friend to mankind, he appeared to me to combine their means of happine&s;s, as well as Paine feels and de&s;cribes the abu&s;es which con&s;titute their mi&s;ery. I &s;aw him, from the very fir&s;t time he was pre&s;ent at the &s;ittings of the a&s;&s;embly, unea&s;y at the di&s;order of the de|bates, afflicted at the influence exerci&s;ed by the galleries, and in doubt whether it were po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch men, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, ever to decree a rational con&s;titu|tion. I cannot help thinking that the knowledge which
<PB N="46" REF="034483_0246_0FFDEAA8587CC4B0">
he then acquired of what we were, attached him more &s;trongly to his country, to which he was impatient to return. How is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he to me, for men to debate a que&s;tion, who are incapable of li&s;tening to each other? Your nation does not even take pains to pre|&s;erve that external decency, which is of &s;o much con&s;e|quence in public a&s;&s;emblies: a giddy manner, carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s, and a &s;lovenly per&s;on, are no recommendations of a legi&s;lator; nor is any thing indifferent which pa&s;&s;es in public, and of which the effect is repeated every day.&mdash; Good heaven! what would he &s;ay at this time, if he were to &s;ee our &s;enators dre&s;t, &s;ince the 31&s;t of May, like wa|termen, in long trow&s;ers, a jacket and a cap, with the bo&s;om of their &s;hirts open, and &s;wearing and ge&s;ticu|lating like drunken <HI>&s;ans-culottes?</HI> He would think it perfectly natural for the people to treat them like their lackeys, and for the whole nation, deba&s;ed by its exce&s;&s;es, to couch beneath the rod of the fir&s;t de&s;pot who &s;hall find means to reduce it to &s;ubjection.&mdash;Williams is equally competent to fill a place in the parliament, or the &s;enate, and will carry with him true dignity wherever he goes.</P>

&s;o badly organized! Accordingly Vandermonde, an <HI>aca|demician</HI> by the way, and the friend of Pache and of Monge, boa&s;ted of &s;erving the latter as a coun&s;ellor, and of being called his wife. Speaking to me one day of the <HI>cordeliers</HI> (to which &s;ect he confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to belong), in oppo&s;ition to the per&s;ons who con&s;idered them as <HI>madmen,</HI> 'We,' &s;aid he, 'de&s;ire order by rea&s;on, and you are of the party that de&s;ires it by force.'

Never will the &s;aying of a &s;tout heart in a feeble body, be applied to him: he is as de|fective in fortitude as in con&s;titution. The timidity which caracterizes him, and which he carries into com|pany in his face and attitude, is not only a defect in his temperament, but &s;eems to be a vice inherent in his &s;oul, which all his philo&s;ophy cannot overcome.&mdash;Hence it was, that after having ably e&s;tabli&s;hed a principle, or demon&s;trated a truth, he voted in the A&s;&s;embly con|trary to his own opinion, when obliged to &s;tand up before the thundering galleries, armed with injurious words, and prodigal of menaces.

<HEAD>PUBLIC SPIRIT.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT was the <HI>Office for Public Spirit,</HI> which has been objected to Roland as &s;o great a crime?&mdash;I am tempted to repeat this que&s;tion to the very per&s;ons who a&s;k it; for I can conceive nothing &s;o chimerical as that phra&s;e.</P>
<P>ROLAND, re&s;tored to the mini&s;try after the 10th of Au|gu&s;t, thought that nothing was more urgent than to diffu&s;e the &s;ame &s;pirit through all the departments of the &s;tate, &s;o that every thing proceeding in an uniform cour&s;e, the &s;ucce&s;s of the revolution might be in&s;ured: he there|fore addre&s;&s;ed a circular letter of that tendency to all the admini&s;trative bodies, nor did it fail to produce a favour|able effect. The Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly felt the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="49" REF="034483_0249_0FFDEAC01222C2E0">
of &s;upporting it; and for want of a body of Public In|&s;truction, which was not yet drawn up, determined that an hundred thou&s;and livres (&pound;.4167) &s;hould be left at the di&s;po&s;al of the mini&s;ter of the interior, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;per&s;ing &s;uch u&s;eful writings as he might think fit.</P>
<P>ROLAND, rigid in his economy, made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to lay out this money to the be&s;t advantage: availing him|&s;elf of the public papers, then in the highe&s;t e&s;timation, he ordered them to be forwarded <HI>gratis</HI> to the popular &s;ocieties, to the pari&s;h prie&s;ts, and to &s;uch zealous indi|viduals as appeared de&s;irous of contributing to the wel|fare of the &s;tate. Some of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, and &s;everal of tho&s;e individuals, &s;eeing that the government inter|e&s;ted it&s;elf in their in&s;truction, took courage, and now and then wrote to the mini&s;ter, to reque&s;t works which the Convention had ordered to be printed, and which they had not received. The mini&s;ter, de&s;irous of &s;ati&s;|fying them, a&s;&s;igned to one of his offices the care of an&s;wering tho&s;e letters, and of forwarding the publicati|ons de&s;ired. In the&s;e things alone con&s;i&s;t all the mighty machinations which have made &s;o much noi&s;e, and which were nothing more than the mere execution of duties impo&s;ed by a decree. Roland was &s;o careful of expence, that at the end of &s;ix months he had only di&s;|bur&s;ed thirty-four thou&s;and livres, out of the hundred thou&s;and of which he was at liberty to di&s;po&s;e; and of tho&s;e he delivered an exact account, together with a li&s;t of the works purcha&s;ed and given away. But as in con|&s;equence of the nature of his place, and of the cir|cum&s;tances in which he found him&s;elf, he &s;ometimes
<PB N="50" REF="034483_0250_0FFDEAC2B9A917D8">
drew up in&s;tructions, which he di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;ame manner; and his writings in general breathed nothing but philo&s;ophy and a love of his fellow-creatures, fears were entertained le&s;t the per&s;onal con&s;ideration that might thence re&s;ult &s;hould render him too powerful.</P>
<P>IT could only be inferred that he in&s;pired great confi|dence, which, by facilitating admini&s;trative operations, was productive of con&s;iderable advantage; but &s;uppo&s;|ing it nece&s;&s;ary to prevent his acquiring too much e&s;|teem, and too great an a&s;cendancy, nothing was nece&s;|&s;ary but to repeal the decree, and to forbid his forward|ing any thing which did not nece&s;&s;arily belong to his cor|re&s;pondence with the admini&s;trative bodies. It was not however any regard to the public weal, but jealou&s;y of the individual, which rai&s;ed &s;uch a fermentation in men's minds; and accordingly they occa&s;ioned a clamour, and accu&s;ed and denounced him in a vague manner, without pointing out the object of their complaint; for if he could have imagined its nature, he would have been the fir&s;t to apply a remedy to the evil apprehended. In&s;tead of employing him&s;elf in that manner, he thought only of defending him&s;elf, at fir&s;t by continuing to do his duty, and afterwards by explaining his conduct, and refuting his calumniators. His triumphant an&s;wers exa&s;|perated envy; he was no longer mentioned but as a public enemy; and a real &s;truggle took place between the courageous functionary, who remained at the helm in &s;pite of the tempe&s;t, and the jealous deceivers or de|ceived, who endeavoured to bury him beneath the waves. He &s;tood firm, as long as he hoped it could an&s;wer any

purpo&s;e; but the weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of the &s;ober party having been demon&s;trated on an important occa|&s;ion, he retired.</P>
<P>HIS enemies dreaded his accounts; and prevented not only their examination, but the report of them from be|ing made to the A&s;&s;embly. The calumniators, when once embarked, thought only of ju&s;tifying their fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions by the ruin of the man who had been the object of them; hence their redoubled efforts, their open per&s;ecution directed even again&s;t me; and for want of well-founded rea&s;ons, the accu&s;ation &s;o often repeated of <HI>corrupting the public &s;pirit,</HI> and of an office e&s;tabli&s;hed for that purpo&s;e, with my pretended &s;hare in the delin|quency; and all without citing a <HI>fact,</HI> a <HI>writing,</HI> or even a reprehen&s;ible <HI>phra&s;e.</HI>&mdash;And yet Roland's glory, in future times, will be in part attached to the able and in|&s;tructive productions of his pen!</P>

The &s;ucce&s;s of my friends, and the triumph of true republicans, con&s;oled me for every thing beforehand: I could have undergone the execution of an unju&s;t &s;entence, or have &s;unk under the &s;troke of &s;ome unfore&s;een atrocity, with calmne&s;s, the pride, and even the joy of innocence, which de&s;pi&s;es death, and knows that its wrongs will be avenged.&mdash; Here I cannot help once more expre&s;&s;ing my regret for the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s of tho&s;e <HI>Memoirs,</HI> which de&s;cribed &s;o well the facts that had come to my knowledge, the per&s;ons by whom I had been &s;urrounded, and the &s;entiments I had experienced in the varying &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events.

In this ridiculous &s;tory, inter|luded with the u&s;ual ornaments of &s;tyle of <HI>Pere Du|che&s;ne,</HI> phy&s;ical and moral probabilities were di&s;regarded alike. I was not only transformed into the abettor of a counter-revolution, but into an old toothle&s;s hag, and was exhorted to weep for my &s;ins till the time &s;hould come for expiating them on the &s;caffold. The hawkers, in pur&s;uance no doubt of their in&s;tructions, did not leave the vicinity of my re&s;idence for a moment, but accom|panied their proclamation of <HI>Pere Duche&s;ne's Great Vi&s;it</HI> with the mo&s;t &s;anguinary advice to the people of the market. I took up my pen, and wrote a few lines to that cowardly Garat, who thinks him&s;elf a &s;age, becau&s;e he is actuated by no pa&s;&s;ion but fear, which makes him pay his court to whatever party chances to be upper|mo&s;t, without the lea&s;t regard to ju&s;tice.

This alleviation of my captivity had contributed to make me forget it, when at noon on the 24th of June, the gaoler's wife came and begged me to &s;tep into her apartment, where an admini&s;trator was waiting to &s;ee me.&mdash;I was in pain, and in bed&mdash;I ro&s;e and followed her into her room, where a man was walking up and down, and another writing, without either of them appearing to perceive my arrival.&mdash;'Am I the per&s;on, gentlemen, whom you a&s;ked for?'&mdash;'You are the wife of citizen Ro|land?'&mdash;'Yes, Roland is my name.'&mdash;'Be &s;o good as to &s;it down.'&mdash;The one continued to write, and the other to walk about.&mdash;I was endeavouring in vain to divine what this comedy might mean, when the <HI>writer</HI> deigned to addre&s;s me&mdash;'I am come,' &s;aid he, 'to &s;et you at liberty.'&mdash;I know not how it was, but I felt my&s;elf very little affected by the information.&mdash;'Why, indeed', an&s;wered I, 'it is very right to remove me from this place; but that is not all; I wi&s;h to return home, and the door of my apartment is &s;ealed up.'&mdash;'The admini|&s;tration will have it opened in the cour&s;e of the day; I am writing for an order, becau&s;e I am the only admini&s;tra|tor here, and two &s;ignatures are nece&s;&s;ary for the gaoler's di&s;charge.'&mdash;He ro&s;e, delivered his me&s;&s;age, and returned
<PB N="55" REF="034483_0255_0FFDEAD02A1911B0">
to &s;peak to me, with the air of a man de&s;irous of in|&s;piring confidence.&mdash;'Do you know,' &s;aid he all on a &s;udden, and as if without de&s;ign, 'where M. Roland is at pre&s;ent?'&mdash;I &s;miled at the que&s;tion, ob&s;erved that it was not candid enough to de&s;erve an an&s;wer; and as the conver&s;ation grew tire&s;ome, retired to my own room to prepare for my departure. My fir&s;t idea was to dine quietly, and not to remove till towards the evening; but upon further reflection, I thought it a folly to remain in a pri&s;on when I was free to go away. Be&s;ides the gaoler came to know if I was getting ready, and I plainly &s;aw that he was impatient to turn me out of my lodgings. It was a little clo&s;et, rendered very uncom|fortable by the dirtine&s;s of the walls, the clo&s;ene&s;s of the grates, and the neighbourhood of a pile of wood, where all the animals belonging to the hou&s;e depo&s;ited their ordure; but as it could contain only one bed, and as the pri&s;oner con&s;equently had the advantage of being alone, the honour of inhibiting it was generally con|ferred upon a new comer, or upon an individual de&s;ir|ous of &s;olitude. Lavacquerie (the gaoler,) who had never &s;een it occupied by any body &s;o contented as I was, and who u&s;ed to admire the plea&s;ure I took an arrang|ing my books and my flowers, told me, that in future he &s;hould call it the pavilion of Flora. I was ignorant that the very moment he was &s;peaking he intended it for Bri&s;&s;ot, whom I did not even &s;uppo&s;e to be my neighbour; and that &s;oon after, it would be inhabited by a heroine, worthy of a better age, the celebrated Char|lotte Corday. My poor maid, who was ju&s;t come to

&s;ee me, wept for joy while packing up my things; the order for &s;etting me at liberty, founded upon the want of evidence, was &s;hewn to me; I &s;ettled my accounts, and di&s;tributed my little favours to the poor, and to the &s;ervants belonging to the pri&s;on; and in my way out met the prince of Linanges, one of the ho&s;tages, who congratulated me in obliging terms upon my en|largement. I an&s;wered, that 'I &s;hould be happy to pay him the &s;ame compliment, as it would be a pledge of the relea&s;e of our commi&s;&s;ioners, and of the return of peace:'&mdash;then &s;ending for a hackney-coach, I walked down &s;tairs, much &s;urpri&s;ed at finding that the admini|&s;trator had not yet left the pri&s;on, and at his coming to the door to &s;ee me into the carriage.</P>
<P>DRIVING home with the intention of leaving a few things there, and of proceeding immediately after to the hou&s;e of the worthy people, who have adopted my daugh|ter, I quitted the hackney-coach with that activity which never allowed me to get out of a carriage without jump|ing, pa&s;&s;ed under the gate-way as if upon wings, and &s;aid cheerfully to the porter as I went by, 'Good-mor|row, Lamarre.' Scarcely, however, had I got up four or five &s;tairs, when two men, who &s;ome how or other had kept clo&s;e at my heels, called out '<HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">toyenne</HI> Ro|land!'&mdash;'What do you want?' &s;aid I, turning about. &mdash;'In the name of the law, we arre&s;t you.' Tho&s;e who know what it is to feel, will ea&s;ily conceive all that I experienced at that moment. I de&s;ired the order to be read to me; and coming to a re&s;olution immediately, &s;tepped down &s;tairs, and walked ha&s;tily acro&s;s the yard.

With this re|que&s;t I could not refu&s;e to comply. After employing the intermediate time in writing notes to my friends to inform them of my new de&s;tination, I took leave of a family which this &s;cene had affected with terror and &s;ur|pri&s;e, and was conducted to the mayor's. There I was put into a little anti-chamber with the in&s;pectors charg|ed to take care of my per&s;on, while the commi&s;&s;ioners proceeded to the office of the admini&s;trators of the po|lice.

<P>MY courage did not &s;ink under the new misfortunes I experienced; but the refinement of cruelty with which they have given me a foreta&s;te of liberty, only to load me with fre&s;h chains, and the barbarous care with which they took advantage of a decree, by applying to me a fal&s;e de&s;ignation, as the mode of legalizing an arbitrary arre&s;t, fired me with indignation. Feeling my&s;elf in that di&s;po&s;ition of mind when every impre&s;&s;ion becomes &s;tronger, and its effect more prejudicial to health, I went to bed; but as I could not &s;leep, it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid thinking. This violent &s;tate, however, never la&s;ts long with me. Being accu&s;tomed to govern my mind, I felt the want of &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and thought my&s;elf a fool for affording a triumph to my per&s;ecu|tors, by &s;uffering their inju&s;tice to break my &s;pirit. They were only bringing fre&s;h odium on them&s;elves, without making much alteration in the &s;ituation I had already found means &s;o well to &s;upport: had I not books and lei&s;ure here as well as at the Abbey? I began indeed to be quite angry with my&s;elf for having allowed my peace of mind to be di&s;turbed, and no longer thought of any thing, but of enjoying exi&s;tence, and of employing my faculties with that independence of &s;pirit which a &s;trong mind pre&s;erves in the mid&s;t of fetters, and which thus

di&s;appoints its mo&s;t determined enemies. As I felt that it was nece&s;&s;ary to vary my occupations, I bought cray|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and had recour&s;e to drawing, which I had laid a&s;ide &s;ome time. Fortitude does not con&s;i&s;t &s;olely in ri&s;ing &s;uperior to circum&s;tances by an effort of the mind, but in maintaining that elevation by &s;uitable con|duct and care. Whenever unfortunate or irritating events take me by &s;urpri&s;e, I am not content with calling up the maxims of philo&s;ophy to &s;upport my courage; but I provide agreeable amu&s;ements for my mind, and do not neglect the art of pre&s;erving health to keep my&s;elf in a ju&s;t equilibrium. I laid out my days then with a certain &s;ort of regularity. In the morning I &s;tudied the Engli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anguage in Shaft&s;bury's E&s;&s;ay on Virtue, and in the poetry of Thom&s;on. The &s;ound metaphy&s;ics of the one, and the enchanting de|&s;criptions of the other, tran&s;ported me by turns to the intellectual regions, and to the mo&s;t touching &s;cenes of nature. Shaft&s;bury<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s rea&s;on gave new &s;trength to mine, and his thoughts invited meditation; while Thom&s;on's &s;en&s;ibility, and his delightful and &s;ublime pictures, went to my heart, and charmed my imagi|nation. I afterwards &s;at down to my drawing till din|ner time. Having been &s;o long without handling the pencil, I could not expect to acquit my&s;elf with much &s;kill; but we always pre&s;erve the power of repeating with plea&s;ure, and of attempting with facility, whatever in our youth we have practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. Accord|ingly, the &s;tudy of the fine arts, con&s;idered as a part of the education of young women, ought, in my opi|nion,
<PB N="64" REF="034483_0264_0FFDEAE97A6789C0">
to be le&s;s directed towards the acqui&s;ition of di&s;|tingui&s;hed talents than to in&s;piring them with the love of employment, making them contract a habit of appli|cation, and multiplying their means of amu&s;ement; for it is thus we e&s;cape from that <HI>ennui</HI> which is the mo&s;t cruel di&s;ea&s;e of man in &s;ociety; and thus we avoid the quick&s;ands of vice, and &s;eductions &s;till more to be feared than vice it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I WILL not then make my daughter a profe&s;&s;or <HI>(une virtuo&s;e):</HI> I &s;hall ever remember that my mother was afraid of my becoming too great a mu&s;ician, or of my devoting my&s;elf entirely to painting, becau&s;e &s;he de&s;ired, above all things, that I &s;hould be fond of the duties of my &s;ex, and learn to be a good hou&s;ewife, in ca&s;e of my becoming the mother of a family. My Eudora then &s;hall learn to accompany her&s;elf in a plea&s;ing manner on the harp, or to play with ea&s;e on the <HI>forte piano</HI>; and &s;hall know enough of drawing, to enable her to contemplate the ma&s;terpieces of art with plea&s;ure, to trace or imitate a flower which delights her, and to &s;hew ta&s;te and elegant &s;implicity in the choice of her ornaments. It is my wi&s;h that the mediocrity of her ta|lents may excite neither admiration in others, nor vanity in her&s;elf. It is my wi&s;h that &s;he may plea&s;e rather by her collective merit, than a&s;toni&s;h at the fir&s;t glance, and that &s;he may rather gain affection by her good qualities, than applau&s;e by her brilliant accompli&s;hments. But, good heavens! I am a pri&s;oner and a great di&s;tance di|vides us! I dare not even &s;end for her to receive my embraces; for hatred pur&s;ues the very children of tho&s;e

<P>COULD not I have brought her with me? &mdash;I have not yet &s;aid what is the &s;ituation of a pri&s;oner at Sainte Pelagie.</P>
<P>THE wing appropriated to females, is divided into long and very narrow corridors, on one &s;ide of which are little cells like that which I have de&s;cribed as my lodg|ing. There, under the &s;ame roof, upon the &s;ame line, and only &s;eparated by a thin pla&s;tered partition, I dwell in the mid&s;t of murderers and women of the town. By the &s;ide of me is one of tho&s;e creatures who make a trade of &s;eduction, and &s;et up innocence to &s;ale; and above me is a woman who forged a&s;&s;ignats, and with a band of mon|&s;ters to which &s;he belongs, tore an individual of her own &s;ex to pieces upon the highway. The door of each cell is &s;ecured by an enormous bolt, and opened every morn|ing by a man who &s;tares in impudently to &s;ee whether you be up or in bed: their inhabitants then a&s;&s;emble in the corridors, upon the &s;tairca&s;es, or in a damp or noi|&s;ome room, a worthy receptacle for this &s;cum of the earth.</P>
<P>IT will be readily believed that I confine my&s;elf con|&s;tantly to my cell; but the di&s;tance is not great enough to &s;ave the ear from the expre&s;&s;ions which &s;uch women
<PB N="66" REF="034483_0266_0FFDEAEC9828BCF8">
may be &s;uppo&s;ed to utter, but which without hearing them it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to conceive.</P>
<P>THIS is not all: the wing where the men are confined, having windows in front of, and very near the building inhabited by the women, the individuals of the two &s;exes of analagous character, enter into conver&s;ation, which is the more di&s;&s;olute, as tho&s;e who hold it are un&s;u&s;|ceptible of fear: ge&s;tures &s;upply the place of actions, and the windows &s;erve as the occa&s;ions of the mo&s;t &s;hameful &s;cenes of infamous debauchery.</P>
<P>SUCH is the dwelling re&s;erved for the worthy wife of an hone&s;t man!&mdash;If this be the reward of virtue on earth, who will be a&s;toni&s;hed at my contempt of life, and at the re&s;olution with which I &s;hall be able to look death in the face? It never appeared to me in a formidable &s;hape; but at pre&s;ent is not without its charms; and I could embrace it with plea&s;ure, if my daughter did not invite me to &s;tay a little longer with her, and if my vo|luntary <HI>exit</HI> would not furni&s;h calumny with weapons again&s;t my hu&s;band, who&s;e glory I &s;hould &s;upport, if they &s;hould dare to carry me before a tribunal.</P>
<P>IN the latter part of Roland's admini&s;tration, con&s;pi|racies and threats &s;ucceeded each other &s;o fa&s;t, that our friends often pre&s;&s;ed us to leave the hotel during the night. Two or three times we yielded to their entrea|ties; but &s;oon growing tired of this daily removal, I ob&s;erved that malevolence would hardly go &s;o far as to violate the abode of a man in office, while it might way|lay and immolate him out of doors; and that, after all, if &s;uch a misfortune were to happen, it would be more

conducive to public utility, and to his per&s;onal glory, for the mini&s;ter to peri&s;h at his po&s;t.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we no longer &s;lept out; but I had my hu&s;band's bed brought into my own room, that we might run the &s;ame hazard, and under my pillow or upon my night-table I kept a pi&s;tol, which I meaned to u&s;e, not for a vain defence, but to &s;ave my&s;elf from the outrages of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, in ca&s;e I &s;hould &s;ee them approach. In that &s;ituation I pa&s;&s;ed three weeks; and certain it is that the hotel was twice be&s;et, and that another time the Mar|&s;eillois, hearing that &s;ome villanous project of other was on foot, &s;ent eighty of their people to guard us. It is certain al&s;o that the Jacobins and Cordeliers were for ever repeating in their tribune, that a 10th of Augu&s;t was as nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t Roland as it had been again&s;t Louis XVI; but as they &s;aid &s;o, it might be pre&s;umed that they were not ready to realize their threat. Death, which I cheerfully braved at that time, cannot but ap|pear de&s;irable to me at Sainte-Pelagie, did not power|ful con&s;iderations chain me to the earth.</P>
<P>MY keepers &s;oon began to &s;uffer more than my&s;elf from my &s;ituation, and were at great pains to render it le&s;s di&s;agreeable. The exce&s;&s;ive heat of the month of July rendered my pri&s;on uninhabitable. The paper with which I covered the grates, did not prevent the &s;un from &s;triking upon the white walls of my nar|row cell, and though my windows remained open all night, the burning and concentrated air of the day did not get cool.</P>

It was then I thought of &s;ending for a <HI>forte-piano,</HI> which I put into her room, and with which I &s;ometimes charmed away the heavy hours. But what a modification did my moral &s;ituation &s;uffer dur|ing that period! The ri&s;ing of &s;ome of the depart|ments &s;eemed to announce the indignation they had con|ceived at the violence offered to their repre&s;entatives, and their re&s;olution of avenging it, by re&s;toring the conven|tion to its former integrity.</P>
<P>I KNEW that Roland was in a &s;afe and peaceful retreat, receiving the con&s;olation, and the attentions of friend|&s;hip; my daughter, taken into the hou&s;e of venerable patriarchs, continued her exerci&s;es, and her education, under their immediate in&s;pection, and with their own children; and my friends, the fugitives, welcomed at Caen, were there &s;urrounded by a re&s;pectable force. I thought I &s;aw the &s;alvation of the republic growing out of events; and re&s;igned to my own fate, I was happy &s;till; for our happine&s;s depends le&s;s on external ob|jects, than on the di&s;po&s;itions and affections of the mind. I employed my time in an u&s;eful and agreeable manner; I &s;ometimes &s;aw the four per&s;ons who u&s;ed to vi&s;it me at the Abbey; the worthy <HI>Grandpr&eacute;,</HI> who&s;e place authori&s;ed him to come, and who came accom|panied by a charming woman; the faithful Bo&s;c, who brought me flowers from the <HI>Jardin des Plantes,</HI> of which the beautiful forms, the brilliant colours, and the &s;weet fragrance, dimini&s;hed the horrors of my melancholly abode &mdash;and the kind Champagneux, who per&s;uaded me &s;o ear|ne&s;tly

<P>TWO men, who&s;e names I once knew, and have ei|ther forgotten, or do not choo&s;e to repeat, becau&s;e the names of &s;uch wretches are not de&s;erving of mention, had been &s;ent to pri&s;on for their malver&s;ations in the clothing of the troops, in which department of the public &s;er|vice they were employed. They had for friends, or for accomplices, &s;ome people of their own de&s;cription, and tho&s;e people were actually admini&s;trators of the police. Charged in that quality with the maintenance of order in the pri&s;ons, and the &s;uperintendance of the gaolers, they came to Sainte Pelagie once or twice a week, with other friends like them&s;elves, ten or twelve in number, and &s;ometimes more, &s;ent for the two darling pri&s;oners to the council-chamber, and there making the gaoler give them capons, chickens, eggs, wine, cordials, coffee, &amp;c. con&s;umed them at his expence, and kept up their orgies three or four hours together. No one would ever imagine, and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly I &s;hall not undertake to relate the brutal joy, the ful&s;ome conver&s;a|tion, and the infamy of the&s;e entertainments.

<P>PLATO might well compare democracy to an <HI>auction</HI> of government, a kind of <HI>fair,</HI> where all po&s;&s;ible modes of admini&s;tration are intermixed.

When|ever this agreeable company came, Bouchaud or his wife never failed to withdraw my key from the door, and to give me notice of their arrival. At la&s;t I took my re|&s;olution, and &s;hut my ears again&s;t their noi&s;e; I even found an entertainment in continuing my <HI>Hi&s;torical Me|moirs,</HI> and in writing vigorous pa&s;&s;ages, before the eyes, as it were, of wretches who would have torn me to pieces if they had heard only a &s;ingle phra&s;e.</P>
<P>AS the 10th of Augu&s;t was at hand, and fears were entertained of a rehear&s;al of the 2d of September, in the pri&s;ons, the admini&s;trators found means to get out the rogues of their acquaintance; and by &s;o doing put an end to the civic fea&s;ts at Sainte-Pelagie.

Advocates for the mo&s;t part, &s;ome had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves at the bar, others had made them|&s;elves known in the republic of letters; &s;everal remark|able only for the integrity they had di&s;played in their profe&s;&s;ions, were &s;eated in the States General, by the e&s;teem that integrity had procured them, while &s;everal others devoted them&s;elves to the laborious, but honour|able functions of journali&s;ts, and &s;truggled courageou&s;|ly with de&s;poti&s;m driven to di&s;pair.</P>

E&s;teemed by his fellow-citizens, who had witne&s;&s;ed his birth, and already noted for that philo&s;ophy which marks a good under&s;tanding, at an early period in life he was deemed worthy of a &s;eat in the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates.</P>
<P><HI>Buzot,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed at Evreux by his &s;trict probity and premature prudence, in&s;pired confidence, and de|&s;erved con&s;ideration at an age when &s;o many others think

of nothing but plea&s;ure. A ta&s;te for &s;tudy, and the &s;oli|tary habits of a meditative mind, filled up all tho&s;e mo|ments which he did not devote to the bar; while man|ners equally pure and gentle, rendered him dear to his friends. The warmth of his &s;entiments, the ea&s;e of his elocution, and the au&s;terity of his principles, procured him the honourable office of carrying his country's com|plaints and demands to the States General.</P>
<P><HI>Gor&s;as,</HI> the father of a numerous family, undertook, from the very beginning of the revolution, to conduct a periodical paper, in which he combated the &s;till power|ful court, and devoted him&s;elf to the defence of the people, always endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h, and never neg|lecting to reclaim, their rights.</P>
<P><HI>Bri&s;&s;ot,</HI> a writer from his early youth, had preached liberty in the time of de&s;poti&s;m, and humanity during the reign of tyranny: he had long prayed for the revolution, had helped to bring it forward by expo&s;ing the abu&s;es of the times, and had undergone impri&s;onment as a puni&s;h|ment for the freedom of his writings. More taken up with moral truths in politics than with the care of his fortune, he had engaged in &s;everal &s;peculations, the fai|lure of which had increa&s;ed his poverty without in|jury to his honour. The revolution was the &s;ignal of his political life: he began his career in the mid&s;t of &s;torms, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing principles, &s;paring no one who appear|ed to violate them, and labouring without intermi&s;&s;ion for the public weal.</P>
<P>I STOP for a moment at the&s;e four per&s;onages: the two fir&s;t made a figure in the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly; Bri&s;&s;ot

obtained a &s;eat in the &s;ucceeding legi&s;lature; and all four became members of the Convention. Was there a &s;ingle circum&s;tance in which they acted unlike them|&s;elves? Did they a&s;&s;ume any authority? Did they ac|quire any wealth? Or did they aim at the &s;upreme power for them&s;elves and their friends?</P>
<P>PETION and Buzot &s;erved the cau&s;e of liberty in the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, with a zeal and con&s;tancy which procured them the hatred of ari&s;tocracy, and the favour of the people: but popular favour is incon&s;tant, while per&s;evering hatred gains fre&s;h &s;trength by the acce&s;|&s;ion of all the jealous, who&s;e attacks never fail to follow any brilliant &s;ucce&s;s. Buzot, belonging to the criminal tribunal of Evreux, preferred doing his duty in his na|tive country to the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame functions at Pa|ris, which would have better &s;uited an ambitious man; he &s;upported his reputation in the pre&s;ence of his fellow-citizens, and of the enemies he had made him&s;elf by his civi&s;m; and obtained by his merit a &s;eat in the Conven|tion, after having e&s;tabli&s;hed a popular &s;ociety in the town, as an indi&s;pen&s;able barrier again&s;t the &s;truggles of de&s;poti&s;m in chains, but not &s;ubdued. It cannot be &s;aid that he had either his re-election, or any kind of em|ploy in view on leaving the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, any more than Petion; for they were the very men who procured the pa&s;&s;ing of the decree forbidding the mem|bers of that a&s;&s;embly to hold any place or to be re-elect|ed for four years to come. They had even demanded an interval of &s;ix; but at the time of the revi&s;ion that decree was repealed, in &s;pite of their endeavours to
<PB N="89" REF="034483_0289_1000F7F7668EF8C0">
maintain it. Buzot then entered the Convention as pure as he had left the co&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly; and there for a while we will leave him. We &s;hall &s;ee hereafter how he conducted him&s;elf, and &s;hall be able to judge whe|ther a man who braved clamour and outrages in &s;up|port of his opinions, even admitting &s;ome of them to be erroneous, could be an ambitious hypocrite, or a con&s;pirator.</P>
<P>PETION was elevated to the mayoralty by popular fa|vour, and pre&s;erved it till after the 10th of Augu&s;t, as well as the hatred of the court, which manife&s;ted it&s;elf on every occa&s;ion, even to the very la&s;t. It is only of late that any one has ventured to accu&s;e him of going to the palace for the purpo&s;e of defending it, while it is well known that he was expo&s;ed to its &s;ire. The calumniating a&s;&s;ertion of his having given <HI>Mandat</HI> orders to fire upon the people, is al&s;o of recent date. I a&s;k what could tempt Petion, dete&s;ted by the court, and beloved by the people, to betray the latter, and &s;erve the former, when it &s;tood on the very brink of ruin? Could he who had ac|quired popularity by combating regal power, have any rea&s;on to forfeit it, when the people were beginning to ob|tain power? Let us put the philo&s;opher and the zealous citizen out of the que&s;tion! let us look only to the man; and we &s;hall &s;ee that even in the e&s;timation of ambition and &s;elf-intere&s;t, the conduct attributed to Petion would have been ab&s;urd; and that if he had not too much principle, he had at lea&s;t too much good &s;en&s;e, to fall into &s;uch an error. He was prevented by his office from putting him&s;elf at the head of the in&s;urrection; and to prevent his oppo|&s;ing

This the heedle&s;s commune forgot to do, and I remember, that Lanthenas went twice from the <HI>Mairie</HI> to the town-hou&s;e, to advi&s;e their putting a &s;trong guard on his hotel. The reporter (Amar) did not &s;ay a &s;yl|lable of the ma&s;&s;acres of the &s;econd of September: he wi&s;ely avoided the danger of touching on a que&s;tion, both &s;ides of which had been &s;upported by the Mountaineers. When Roland denounced tho&s;e ma&s;&s;acres, the Jacobins &s;aid they were the work of the people and of its ven|geance: they even made it a crime not to applaud them; and when Petion, with the re&s;t of the right &s;ide, obtain|ed a decree to pro&s;ecute the murderers, Petion and the right &s;ide were called the enemies of liberty and of the people. But when the decree had fallen into de&s;uetude, when the Jacobins triumphed, and the twenty-two were pro&s;cribed, the Jacobins them&s;elves, and Hebert among the fir&s;t of them, impudently a&s;&s;erted that the ma&s;&s;acres were Petion's work.</P>
<P><HI>Guadet, Vergniaux,</HI> and <HI>Gen&s;onn&eacute;,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by their talents, and well known at Bourdeaux as friends to the revolution, were elected members of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|bly. They were the fir&s;t men for talents in that body, a kind of ari&s;tocracy which procured them more numerous and more dangerous enemies than any want of civi&s;m could have done. They alternately filled the pre&s;ident's chair on the tenth of Augu&s;t at that critical moment when the weak would have trembled at &s;uch a painful pre-eminence; nor can any but knaves reproach them with the moderation and the temper they di&s;played in

their conduct at that intere&s;ting period. Bri&s;&s;ot natu|rally became intimate with them, becau&s;e he approached nearer to the level than any other per&s;on, in like manner as a &s;imilarity of &s;entiments had made him connect him|&s;elf with the defenders of principles in the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, to which he did not belong: the countryman and friend of Petion, he became acquainted with &s;uch of his colleagues as &s;upported that cau&s;e in favour of which his journal was compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>HE had laboured under the &s;ame mi&s;take as many other per&s;ons, in regard to la Fayette; or rather it may be &s;aid, that la Fayette, &s;wayed at fir&s;t by the principles he had adopted, had no longer the &s;trength of mind ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport them when the &s;truggle became diffi|cult; or that, fearing the con&s;equences of too great a power in the hands of the people, he deemed it prudent to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome kind of counterpoi&s;e. The fact is, that as he profe&s;&s;ed republicani&s;m in private, Bri&s;&s;ot was a long while before he could believe him guilty, when he was become &s;o in the eyes of more violent men. But he had blamed him without re&s;erve, and publicly de|clared his rupture with him, before the affair of the <HI>Champ-de-Mars.</HI> Here the reporter piques him&s;elf &s;o little upon accuracy, that he confounds dates: he makes Bri&s;&s;ot come to the Jacobins in <HI>March</HI> 1791, to prepare the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Champ-de-Mars,</HI> which did not take place till <HI>July,</HI> and which was &s;olely occa&s;ioned by the flight and return of the king in the month of June. It is well known be&s;ides, that Bri&s;&s;ot did not go to the Ja|cobins to excite them to &s;ign the petition, but merely be|cau&s;e

he was appointed one of the committee to draw it up. I remember to have heard him relate on the fol|lowing day, that <HI>Laclos,</HI> who was al&s;o of the committee, complained of &s;uch a violent head-ach that he could not hold the pen, and that he begged of Bri&s;&s;ot to take it; that the &s;ame Laclos propo&s;ed the in&s;ertion of an article which he mentioned with an air of indifference, but which would have been favourable to d'Orleans; and that he (Bri&s;&s;ot) rejected it with indignation, and &s;ub&s;tituted the pa&s;&s;age recommending a republic, for which that mo|ment was peculiarly proper, and might have been turned to great account. It is al&s;o well known that the a&s;&s;embly having decided in favour of the king, the Jacobins, in|&s;tead of &s;ending their petition to the <HI>Champ-de-Mars,</HI> &s;ent deputies there to &s;ay, that it was not a proper place for their purpo&s;e, after the decree. This took place on the Saturday. I &s;aw the deputies come to the <HI>Champ-de-Mars</HI> at noon, with not more than two or three hundred per&s;ons, and where Verrieres, the little hump-backed cordelier, and &s;ome others, were declaim|ing upon the national altar. It was on the Sunday morning, that two men were hanged, when there were not thirty per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled, a fact which I have heard attributed with &s;ome probability to the contriv|ance of the Lameths and others, who wanted an op|portunity of employing force, and in&s;piring terror. Certain it is, that Sunday having brought together a great number of people, who had been attracted by the vague report of a petition, while that of the hanging bu|&s;ine&s;s had not as yet got abroad, <HI>Robert</HI> &s;et about drawing

one up, completed it, and was getting it &s;igned, when the military were called out, in con&s;equence of a denunciation made to the a&s;&s;embly, and of the violent letter written by Charles Lameth, the pre&s;ident, to the commune of Paris, &s;etting forth the nece&s;&s;ity of repre&s;&s;ing the horrid di&s;or|ders of which two men had been the victims. Thus did the morning murder, committed, as it were, by &s;tealth, &s;erve as a pretext for &s;hooting the people a&s;&s;embled in the afternoon. The red flag was hoi&s;ted at the town-hall, terror and impri&s;onment were the order of the day, and prepared the triumph of the revi&s;ors, who wi&s;hed to give &s;trength to the party of the court. Surely it will be quite enough to read the <HI>Patriot</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;ot's Journal.</NOTE> of that time, to judge whether it be po&s;&s;ible that Bri&s;&s;ot, who denounced the affair of the Champ-de-Mars, &s;upported the people, and attacked the revi&s;ors, could at the &s;ame time have been their accomplice. This accu&s;ation is ab&s;urd in the ex|treme! But every thing is &s;o from one end to the other of this work of iniquity. I will not enter here into the que&s;tion of the war, which was the &s;ignal of the great di|vi&s;ion that took place among the patriots. Robe&s;pierre, fiery, jealous, greedy of popularity, and inclined to do|mineer, both by his nature and the high opinion he en|tertained of his own merit, put him&s;elf at the head of the party that oppo&s;ed the declaration of ho&s;tilities. It would be worth the trouble to examine the &s;peeches on the &s;ub|ject: to me it appeared that the ma&s;s of enlightened per&s;ons were in general for the affirmative, and con&s;equently of Bri&s;&s;ot's opinion. Certain it is that the court was very re|pugnant

to the mea&s;ure, and that the king was in a man|ner overruled by his council. He had every thing to gain by delay: the enemy were making their preparations at their ea&s;e, and our inaction would have delivered us into their hands, a defencele&s;s prey. Robe&s;pierre could not forgive Bri&s;&s;ot this triumph. The ice was broken, and from that moment it became his &s;ole object to bring for|ward all the misfortunes that befel us, whether inevitable or not, as crimes again&s;t the parti&s;ans of the war. The exaggeration of pa&s;&s;ion became by degrees a &s;y&s;tem of refined calumny, artfully contrived, and ob&s;tinately per|&s;evered in. Bri&s;&s;ot could no longer make the eulogium of any man, without its being con&s;trued into perfidy, if that man afterwards departed from the line of duty. Bri&s;&s;ot was acquainted with &s;everal per&s;ons in the mini&s;try by whom he was e&s;teemed&mdash;here was another rea&s;on of jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t. Tho&s;e mini&s;ters, honourably di&s;|graced by the court, were recalled after the fall of the throne; and Bri&s;&s;ot at that time was one of the few men in the a&s;&s;embly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any talents, or exerci&s;ing any influence: Bri&s;&s;ot con&s;equently appeared an im|portant per&s;onage to Robe&s;pierre, who determined to ruin him, and had full lei&s;ure to effect his purpo&s;e; for Bri&s;&s;ot, con&s;tantly confiding in the goodne&s;s of his inten|tions, could not prevail upon him&s;elf to go and enter the li&s;ts at the Jacobins with an everla&s;ting harranguer, who tired him to death. He de&s;pi&s;ed the adver&s;ary by whom he was overcome. But who could have believed the convention &s;o weak, or the people &s;o &s;tupid? Tho&s;e only, who not &s;uffering them&s;elves to be hurried along by

the current of daily events, recur frequently to the page of hi&s;tory, meditate upon its contents, and compare the pre&s;ent with times pa&s;t. I never &s;aw any man in place do &s;o &s;ince the revolution; indeed they have hardly time to breathe, and to an&s;wer to the calls of each return|ing day, without an extreme and uncommon economy in the di&s;tribution of their hours.</P>
<P>THE letter of Gen&s;onn&eacute; and his a&s;&s;ociates to Louis XVI. cannot be con&s;trued into trea&s;on, unle&s;s by the mo&s;t de|termined malevolence. It is true, nobody could at that time be &s;ure of a &s;ucce&s;sful revolution: the wi&s;e&s;t men were therefore de&s;irous that the king &s;hould feel the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of enforcing the con&s;titution, and re&s;olve upon re|calling, and retaining tho&s;e mini&s;ters who were &s;incerely inclined to execute the laws. They had given proofs of their patrioti&s;m, and the application for their recal was not a &s;tep directed by private intere&s;t, but the expre&s;&s;ion of the general will. Roland, for his part, knew nothing of the letter until a late period, and probably would never have heard of it if it had not become public. But let us attend to the charges brought again&s;t him in the&s;e articles of impeachment, which will reflect everla&s;ting di&s;grace on the age and nation, that could either applaud them, or even &s;uffer them to pa&s;s, without the &s;tronge&s;t marks of reprobation.</P>
<P>"THE very day after the 10th of Augu&s;t," &s;ay the&s;e articles,
<Q>Gen&s;onn&eacute; and his faction po&s;ted up libels re|flecting upon tho&s;e who had contributed to the fall of the throne, upon the Jacobins, upon the council-ge|neral of the commune, and upon the people of Paris.
<PB N="96" REF="034483_0296_1000F619DB4CB948">
The pens of Louvet, Bri&s;&s;ot, and Champagneux, were &s;et to work; enormous packets of tho&s;e libels were &s;een at Roland's hou&s;e, and all his &s;ervants were em|ployed in di&s;per&s;ing them.</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE read this pa&s;&s;age twice, without being able to conceive how any one could dare to write it. Gen|&s;onn&eacute; never to my knowledge po&s;ted up any thing: Louvet was editor of the <HI>Sentinel,</HI> of which complete collections exi&s;t: it was of great &s;ervice to the revolu|tion, and is an everla&s;ting refutation of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions; for it breaths nothing but liberty, great and wi&s;e prin|ciples, the hatred of tyranny, and the love of equality. Roland has perhaps contributed as much as any body to reconcile men's minds to the revolution; his circular letters exi&s;t; let them be read; and let any one be pointed out, that is not even excellent. Champagneux never di&s;patched any papers but tho&s;e printed by order of the a&s;&s;embly; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was any alteration ever made in them; the contrary &s;uppo&s;ition is as ab&s;urd as it is abo|minable. In the fir&s;t place, it was impo&s;&s;ible, for it was not Roland who had them printed, but the authors at Baudoins, from whom the mini&s;ter u&s;ed to demand a certain number of copies: &s;econdly, it was u&s;ele&s;s; for &s;uppo&s;ing that he made a &s;election, he was free to &s;end off a &s;maller number of tho&s;e which he deemed the lea&s;t de&s;erving of attention: and, la&s;tly, if there had been the &s;malle&s;t breach of faith, the per&s;ons intere&s;ted would not have waited a year to make their complaints, and demon&s;trate the deceit. What then can be intended

by this ridiculous pa&s;&s;age?&mdash;I have divined it; and it is a matter which demands &s;ome explanation.</P>
<P>IN revolutionary movements, the mo&s;t active people are not always the mo&s;t blamele&s;s: how many beings come forward only that they may appear of &s;ome con|&s;equence in the world! Their &s;ervices, however, are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; but when once the point in view is gained, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to loo&s;e no time in re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hing order to avoid the di&s;&s;olution of the &s;ocial body. The commune formed on the 10th of Augu&s;t had con|tributed to the fall of the tyrant: they did well; but &s;e|veral of its members had been guilty of various ex|ce&s;&s;es; a great deal of pillage and robbery had taken place at the <HI>Tuileries</HI> and el&s;ewhere; con&s;iderable &s;ums had been given to the commune for the purcha&s;e of corn; and it was the duty of the mini&s;ter of the home department to demand their accounts, and to tran&s;mit them to the legi&s;lative body. Roland then pre&s;&s;ed the commune to give in their accounts; but the commune being little di&s;po&s;ed, and &s;till le&s;s able, to comply, the mini&s;ter, with a view to ju&s;tice, and to avoid &s;haring in the blame, made his report to the a&s;&s;embly accordingly. If the a&s;&s;embly had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient energy, it would not have waited for &s;uch an opportunity, or at lea&s;t would have laid hold of it, to con&s;titute a new commune, a political operation equally ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. But Danton, who made u&s;e of the commune, was mini&s;ter: he had parti&s;ans in the a&s;&s;embly; and contrived to keep his tool. Roland remained then in a difficult &s;ituation; liable to accu&s;ation if he did not demand the&s;e accounts,
<PB N="98" REF="034483_0298_0FFDEBD9301105F0">
and &s;ure to be hated if he did. His upright character did not permit him to he&s;itate; his au&s;terity perhaps gave &s;till greater &s;olemnity to the demand; and when he was required to repre&s;ent the &s;tate of Paris to the a&s;&s;embly, he gave no quarter to the errors, the follies, and the faults of the commune. They were in great number; and the commune con&s;equently became his enemy. Thus did he acquire the hatred of that active body, who among the populace had the reputation of being the patriots of the 10th of Augu&s;t, and the exterminators of tyranny. Add to the commune all tho&s;e excited by the plunderer, Danton, again&s;t a colleague who&s;e au&s;|terity was a con&s;traint upon him, and who had be&s;ides denounced the September ma&s;&s;acres, another exploit of a part of the commune, Santerre, &amp;c. Add al&s;o tho&s;e whom the jealous Robe&s;pierre &s;et again&s;t Bri&s;&s;ot's con|nexions, and you will have altogether a very con&s;iderable number, either of guilty men who felt the nece&s;&s;ity of getting rid of their watchful denunciator, or of extravagant patriots prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the heroes of the 10th of Augu&s;t, without &s;eeing to the bottom of the bu&s;ine&s;s, or of people intere&s;ted in &s;upporting them, or of the ignorant whom they impo&s;ed upon, with a few envious popular leaders, well &s;killed in contriving the overthrow of a man in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public e&s;teem. Such was the origin of a party, which was increa&s;ed by all the new comers to the convention, too little acquainted with Paris, and public affairs, to form a right judgment of things, and by all tho&s;e who&s;e vanity was hurt by the &s;uperiority of the di&s;tingui&s;hed members, with whom Ro|land
<PB N="99" REF="034483_0299_0FFDC5AF907EEE50">
naturally became itimate, becau&s;e men of equal ca|pacity are ever fond of one another's company. Had I more time, I could follow this party through all its ra|mifications, and indicate all its enterpri&s;es; but this is enough to put others in the way of coming at the truth.</P>
<P>IT now appears clearly, that the party at pre&s;ent pre|dominant, of which Amar is the organ, be&s;tows the ap|pellation of <HI>libel</HI> upon tho&s;e writings in which Roland exhibited the &s;tate of Paris, called for the accounts of the commune, held up the ma&s;&s;acres of September to public indignation, and recommended the e&s;tabli&s;hment of order by way of reconciling all hearts to the revo|lution; which is &s;omewhat more difficult than killing people, according to the practice of the&s;e gentlemen. They do not point out the&s;e pretended libels, for that would be burning their fingers; but they &s;peak of libels in general, and the public believing there mu&s;t needs be &s;ome foundation for a charge &s;o boldly brought for|ward, applaud the declamation, and think them&s;elves avenged when their own champions are put to death.</P>
<P>THE under&s;tanding kept up with the Pru&s;&s;ians is a piece of extravagance which one knows not how to cha|racterize, and Brun&s;wick mu&s;t &s;urely laugh at &s;eeing people accu&s;ed of being his friends who attacked him with &s;o much vigour. It will &s;uffice to read the letter in which it is pretended that Roland confe&s;&s;es the exi&s;tence of a plan for quitting Paris, to form a judgment of the matter, e&s;pecially as to the intention of opening a pa&s;&s;age for Brun&s;wick. I know, that on the &s;uppo|&s;ition of the Pru&s;&s;ians approaching very near Paris,
<PB N="100" REF="034483_0300_0FFDEB40E9D1B040">
the que&s;tion, what would be proper to do, or whe|ther it would be expedient to &s;end away from that town the national repre&s;entation, in which the whole empire was intere&s;ted, was once debated; but the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion was &s;light, and hypothetical, more &s;o indeed than it ought to have been; nor did any one of the mini&s;ters threaten his colleagues. It was Danton, who, after the event, thought of bringing forward the denunciation, by way of making a merit of it to him&s;elf, and of injuring Roland. I recollect tho&s;e matters perfectly, having heard my hu&s;band mention them on the breaking up of the council, which was then held at his hotel. As to the great movement of the people of Paris, it is well known that it &s;erved as a veil for the ma&s;&s;acres of the month of September, and that it was Kellerman's action on the 20th of that month that &s;aved the republic.</P>
<P>IT is not le&s;s ridiculous to hear the government of that time accu&s;ed of &s;tarving the people. Never during Ro|land's admini&s;tration were provi&s;ions &s;o &s;carce, and diffi|cult to procure, as they are become &s;ince: his anxiety on that head was extreme, and any one may recur to what he &s;ays of the bad admini&s;tration peculiar in that re&s;pect to the commune of Paris.</P>
<P>IT is an infamous and ab&s;urd calumny to a&s;&s;ert that Roland employed the &s;ums given him to purcha&s;e pro|vi&s;ions, in the pay of hireling writers. In the fir&s;t place, tho&s;e &s;ums never pa&s;&s;ed through his hands, nor could he di&s;po&s;e of them otherwi&s;e than by orders upon the trea|&s;ury indicating the purpo&s;es for which they were wanted. Secondly, he gave an account of tho&s;e monies; he did
<PB N="101" REF="034483_0301_0FFDEB43E72B3CA8">
&s;o every month, and repeated it on his going out of office, the whole accompanied by &s;ufficient vouchers. Of the&s;e accounts he never cea&s;ed to call for a report; and they were accordingly examined; but as no fault could be found with them, the Mountain would never &s;uffer a report to be made. Tho&s;e who doubt it need only a&s;k <HI>Dupin,</HI> a deputy and one of the commi&s;&s;ioners charged with their examination; they need only a&s;k <HI>Saint-Aubin,</HI> a commi&s;&s;ioner of accounts, by whom the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their labours, which la&s;ted two months, and in which they proceeded with great rigour and a de&s;ire of finding fault, but without &s;ucce&s;s. In the third place, no more than one hundred thou&s;and livres (&pound;4167) were given to Ro|land to pay for compo&s;itions and printing, out of which in &s;ix months he only &s;pent thirty-four thou&s;and (&pound;1417), of which he likewi&s;e gave an account; the re&s;t remained in the public trea&s;ury, as appears by the &s;tatement of what had been di&s;bur&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT requires a degree of malignity &s;carcely credible to advance &s;uch &s;candalous fal&s;ehood! Roland never e&s;tabli&s;h|ed any new offices in his department; he only a&s;&s;igned to particular clerks the care of forwarding the papers he was charged to &s;end off; nor did he ever give to any thing the name of <HI>formation of public &s;pirit:</HI> his enemies began by inventing the chimera, and afterwards bap|tized it as they thought proper. As to me, I never in|terfered, much le&s;s did I direct any thing: I defy the proof of it. Roland had nothing to do with his colleagues in the department of finances; nor did his colleagues
<PB N="102" REF="034483_0302_0FFDEB4698417518">
ever interfere in forwarding papers. It is impo&s;&s;ible to mention a &s;ingle paper di&s;patched by Roland him&s;elf, which did not tend to attach the people to the 10th of Augu&s;t, in&s;tead of inducing them to ca&s;t an odium on the events of that day. Roland had no command over the admini&s;tration of the po&s;t-office to get any thing in|tercepted; nor, if he had, would the admini&s;trators ever have been able, without courting their own ruin, to engage in &s;o odious a manoeuvre. If they had only at|tempted it, how &s;everely would they have been puni&s;h|ed; they, who have been &s;o much per&s;ecuted, and who&s;e places have been taken from them, though their per&s;ons have not been touched?</P>
<P>IT is fal&s;e that Roland ever &s;uppre&s;&s;ed any thing which he was directed to forward: I have &s;een him &s;end off the &s;peeches of Marat. It is equally fal&s;e that any thing was or could be mutilated, as I have &s;aid before: I have &s;hewn that it was no le&s;s impo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ible than impro|bable, that the denunciation would not have been delayed till this time, if only a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the kind had oc|curred; and that even now, when they have the impu|dence to advance it, they neither can nor dare cite a fact. But what an excellent precaution was that of ac|cu&s;ing Roland and the Monituer of making the moun|taineers <HI>appear like madmen</HI> in the eyes of the whole re|public, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mi&s;placing of a word! Not being able to annihilate hi&s;tory, they wi&s;h to bring its materials into di&s;credit! O my God! if nothing were to remain but their calumnies and their conduct, the atrocity of their fal&s;ehoods would neverthele&s;s appear. For a few years
<PB N="103" REF="034483_0303_0FFDEB48251502F0">
truth may be reduced to &s;ilence; but it cannot be ex|tingui&s;hed: the very efforts made to annihilate it ope|rate a contrary way, and &s;erve to give evidence of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THE di&s;covery of the iron door is al&s;o brought for|ward again&s;t Roland as a crime; and nothing is more ea&s;y by way of accounting for the want of proof again&s;t the pretended Bri&s;&s;otine faction, than to &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a part of its contents. But Roland had wit|ne&s;&s;es, and Roland did not contradict him&s;elf. A lock|&s;mith of the name of <HI>Gamin,</HI> living at Ver&s;ailles, gave in|formation of his having been employed by Louis XVI. to make a little hiding-place in his apartment at the Tui|leries; but did not know what it might contain. Ro|land was charged with the in&s;pection of the Tuileries: the palace and every thing belonging to it were intru&s;ted to his care. Taking with him <HI>Gamin,</HI> and <HI>Heurtier</HI> a re&s;pectable architect, he repaired to the kings apart|ment, where, in a pa&s;&s;age between two doors, Gamin lifted up a pannel of wain&s;cot, and di&s;covered a little iron door, which Roland ordered him to open. It &s;erved to clo&s;e a hole in the wall in which &s;everal packets of papers were found. Roland called a &s;ervant, ordered a napkin to be brought, took out the packets, without untying them, ca&s;t his eyes upon the indor&s;ements, which announced a corre&s;pondence with the gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">als and &s;everal other per&s;ons, put them in the napkin in the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;ence of Heurtier and Gamin, gave the parcel to his &s;ervant, and repaired to the convention, wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de|po&s;ited them in a formal manner. As he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="104" REF="034483_0304_0FFDEB4AD37936D8">
through the apartments he met a member, who a&s;ked him what he had there.&mdash;'Things of con&s;equence,' an|&s;wered he, 'which I am going to carry to the conven|tion.'&mdash;It remains to be &s;aid, that when the mini&s;ter of the interior was made re&s;pon&s;ible for the palace, and every thing it contained, the convention appointed a committee of &s;ome of its members to examine all the papers printed or in manu&s;cript, which were there at the time of the a&s;&s;ault, and which had been collected to|gether. The members of the committee were angry that the mini&s;ter had not &s;ent for them to be pre&s;ent at the di&s;covery. But Roland thought nothing could be more natural, upon Gamins information, than to repair to the place; and, upon finding the papers, to &s;ub|mit them to the in&s;pection of the convention. He con|ducted him&s;elf like a man who&s;e con&s;cious rectitude renders him incapable of di&s;tru&s;t; though certainly very unlike an artful man of the world, who fore&s;ees all po&s;|&s;ible events, and takes care not to hurt the vanity of others. Roland was guilty of no real fault on this occa|&s;ion; but he di&s;covered great want of prudence and cau|tion. 'Add to this, that among the members of the com|mi&s;&s;ion at the palace was one <HI>Calon,</HI> a per&s;on whom Roland de&s;pi&s;ed, and with whom he &s;ometimes had di&s;putes, becau&s;e the commi&s;&s;ioners wi&s;hed to exceed their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, and to turn every thing topzy-turvy at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lace wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n they plea&s;ed, while Roland, naturally rigid, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a right to re&s;i&s;t from his re&s;pon&s;ibility, fre|quen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;ed their proceedings.

of public notoriety, that he had &s;et up a coffee-hou&s;e and tavern clo&s;e to the a&s;&s;embly, in partner&s;hip with a woman whom he kept.</P>
<P>IT is now ea&s;y to &s;ee the origin of all the outcry about the iron cabinet, and to conceive how eagerly Roland's different enemies availed them&s;elves of appearances to throw &s;u&s;picion on his conduct, and how many little pa&s;&s;ions concurred in rai&s;ing doubts concerning that cir|cum&s;tance. Of what value is it &s;ince become to tho&s;e, who wi&s;hing to accu&s;e Roland's friends in the convention of a con&s;piracy, find it &s;o convenient to make the world believe that the cabinet contained papers which the mi|ni&s;ter concealed! But recollect dates, calculate facts, and by attending particularly to the one in que&s;tion, you will &s;ee, if Roland had meant to convey any thing away, he would fir&s;t have repaired in &s;ecret to the place, after which he would have called witne&s;&s;es, and ob&s;erved every nece&s;&s;ary form in the di&s;covery. His rapid and incautious way of proceeding, by expo&s;ing him to blame, mu&s;t prove his innocence to every reflecting mind. <HI>Heurtier</HI> exi&s;ts; he is a man advanced in years, and generally e&s;teemed; and <HI>Gamin</HI> exi&s;ts al&s;o; they took minutes of all that pa&s;&s;ed, which will not be lo&s;t to hi&s;tory any more than the&s;e details. I &s;hall make no remark on the charge in which Roland is accu&s;ed of favouring the parti&s;ans of ari&s;tocracy, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceiving the emigrants with open arms. Roland in his admi|ni&s;tration was ju&s;t, impartial, and &s;evere: he received nothing but the law with open arms: it was the ob|ject of all his attention, and the guide of all his deci|&s;ions.
<PB N="106" REF="034483_0306_0FFDEB5074B1E228">
It mu&s;t no doubt appear as &s;trange to ari&s;to|cracy to be put under the protection of &s;uch a patron, as it mu&s;t to Brun&s;wick to hear him&s;elf &s;tyled Roland's friend: but the&s;e are follies which will not long prevail. True it is that the Republic once e&s;tabli&s;hed, Roland wi&s;hed to attach its very enemies to it by an equitable form of government: he wi&s;hed for good laws in&s;tead of blood. Tho&s;e principles in&s;pired with a kind of confidence the per&s;ons who, without being fanatics in the cau&s;e of royalty, were however far from being republicans. They felt their prejudices give way, and acknowledged that the mini&s;ter of the Interior, although a patriot, appeared to be an hone&s;t man. The jealous noted down the&s;e confe&s;&s;ions, that they might repre&s;ent Roland as a parti&s;an of ari&s;tocracy; a title by which they have &s;ince di&s;tingui&s;hed every friend of rea&s;on and hu|manity.</P>
<P>I SHOULD be glad to know how Roland, who, under the old government, had &s;tood in the way of his own promotion by &s;upporting the liberty of commerce, on which &s;ubject his opinions were con&s;idered as crimes; who had profe&s;&s;ed his principles in works publi&s;hed from fifteen to twenty years before; who, faithful to tho&s;e principles at the time of the revolution, had taken &s;uch a decided part in its favour as to attract the enmity of all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ari&s;tocracy of Lyons; who, elevated to the mini&s;try, had there conducted him&s;elf with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s and energy; who had dared to write a letter to the king, which the parti&s;ans of the throne have not yet forgiven him; who, recalled to the admini&s;tration

of public affairs by the in&s;urrection of the 10th of Augu&s;t, was intere&s;ted in defending it both by his intere&s;t and his glory; how, I &s;ay, could Roland &s;eek to decry it; to favour the royali&s;ts who hated him, or would have looked upon him with eyes of di&s;tru&s;t; and to re&s;tore ari&s;tocracy, of which he had drawn upon him&s;elf the hatred, and which at this very moment is rejoicing at the per&s;ecution he undergoes? What could he have in view? He had reached the highe&s;t elevation then at|tainable, and enjoyed great con&s;ideration: both ambition and &s;elf-intere&s;t could &s;eek for nothing more than to re|main in place; and if he had li&s;tened to them he would have &s;oothed men's pa&s;&s;ions, flattered the different par|ties, and have been upon his guard again&s;t giving of|fence. The care of not making enemies is the &s;tronge&s;t characteri&s;tic of the ambitious man, already arrived at eminence in a republic; while Roland, on the contrary, rigorou&s;ly denounced the abu&s;es he could not repre&s;s, never flattered any man, nor ever gave way to the vio|lence or to the prejudices of the times. This is the conduct of a &s;incere and courageous man, and not that of a hypocrite.&mdash;Let us now return to the members of the Convention, to whom the &s;ame rea&s;oning will apply.</P>
<P>THE electoral body of Paris was evidently at the com|mand of Robe&s;pierre and Danton: its nominations were entirely their work. It is notorious that Robe&s;pierre made an harangue again&s;t Prie&s;tley, and in favour of Marat: it is notorious that he brought forward his bro|ther: it is equally known that Danton, laying a&s;ide
<PB N="108" REF="034483_0308_0FFDEB588340C380">
his mini&s;terial functions, repaired to the hu&s;tings to ex|erci&s;e his &s;way; nor is it forgotten, that the&s;e leaders of the electors were the means of getting d'Orleans re|turned. (Here I a&s;k, by the way, Why he was not waited for at the trial of the deputies with whom he was confounded in the articles of impeachment, and to whom he was a&s;&s;igned as an accomplice?) Among the Pa|ri&s;ian delegates to the Convention were &s;een the mem|bers of the famous Committee of Vigilance <HI>(&s;urveillance),</HI> that directed the ma&s;&s;acres of September, and advi&s;ed the departments to imitate &s;o good an example, in a cir|cular letter, which is well known, and which Danton forwarded under his own cover. There were al&s;o &s;een men accu&s;ed of robberies, whom the council-general, compo&s;ed in part of new members, has &s;ince thought it indi&s;pen&s;able to denounce, although &s;itting in the Con|vention, where they &s;till remain on the &s;ummit of the Mountain (Sergent and Panis). The <HI>con&s;tituents,</HI> re|pairing to the Convention, and acquainted with Paris, the revolution, and all the men of any note, were un|ea&s;y at this Pari&s;ian deputation, indignant at the events of the 2d of September, di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;tru&s;t the for|mer, and to puni&s;h the authors of the latter. That di&s;|po&s;ition would not have e&s;caped the per&s;ons intere&s;ted, even if the <HI>con&s;tituents</HI> had endeavoured to conceal it, which they did not. But the Convention opened be|fore it was complete, and the Pari&s;ian members formed a party, which was reinforced by all the ignorant and weak, as fa&s;t as they arrived: it had collected a con&s;ider|able number by the time the whole Convention had
<PB N="109" REF="034483_0309_0FFDEB5C4FB31AA0">
a&s;&s;embled, and all the <HI>con&s;tituents</HI> were arrived. I need not &s;ay, that I give this appellation to the members who had belonged to the a&s;&s;embly of 1789, and who, for the mo&s;t part, &s;eated them&s;elves on what was called the right &s;ide of the Convention.</P>
<P>THE agitation of Paris, the conduct of the commune, the weakne&s;s of the department<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Department means here the directory of the department of Paris, which made &s;ome feeble attempts to check the pre&s;umption of the Commune. <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, the high tone of its deputies, and the tyranny of the galleries, &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of a departmental guard, as the fir&s;t &s;tep to in&s;ure the liberty of the national repre&s;entation, to remind the Pa|ri&s;ians that they were not its ma&s;ters, and to prevent the departments from forgetting the nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining an equilibrium for the common advantage. In Buzot's report on the &s;ubject may be &s;een the principal rea&s;ons in favour of the propo&s;ition. It was a gauntlet thrown down as the &s;ignal for combat. The Pari&s;ian members felt they were in danger of lo&s;ing their a&s;cendance, and as &s;ome of the number were criminals, who could only be &s;aved by maintaining it, every effort was made to party &s;o fatal a blow. From that moment it became a war of extermination, and as &s;uch they carried it on; but their adver&s;aries were not &s;ufficiently aware of the danger; they were not ready to coale&s;ce, becau&s;e they did not imagine that truth &s;tood in need of a party; they neglected the Jacobin club, becau&s;e the Jacobins gave them a bad reception; and they did not intrigue, becau&s;e they had neither money nor cun|ning
<PB N="110" REF="034483_0310_0FFDEB5DE00F1B88">
for the purpo&s;e. About forty of them u&s;ed in|deed to meet and conver&s;e at Valaz&eacute;'s, whence there proceeded much courage to &s;upport principles and brave clamour, and much devotion to the public good; but never any mea&s;ures, unle&s;s in the &s;hape of motions, which were imputed to them as crimes. They wi&s;hed to work on the con&s;titution in the be&s;t way they might be able, &s;ince it was in vain to hope by further &s;kirmi&s;hing to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of higher ground. The leaders of the Pari&s;ian deputation were de&s;irous, on the contrary, to entangle the Convention in a trial, that they might keep up the heat of the public mind; make a merit of the death of man already tumbled from the throne, and incapable of doing mi&s;chief; and retard a con&s;titution, of which the completion would have re&s;tored order, and &s;et bounds to their power. But, it may be &s;aid, the&s;e are the men who have made one &s;ince the 2d of June&mdash;Yes, and the&s;e are the men who prevented it before, as the journals of the time will &s;hew; and the proof that they care no more about it at pre&s;ent is, that after having got it accepted, they have &s;u&s;pended its exe|cution, by declaring that France remains in a &s;tate of revolution; &s;o that the departments, which were only induced to accept it by la&s;&s;itude, enjoy no greater repo&s;e than before. Never, indeed, did they &s;uffer &s;o much agitation and mi&s;ery of every kind. It is ea&s;y for any man who has attended the &s;ittings of the Convention, to &s;ay whence all the &s;candalous &s;cenes proceeded. When the members of the right &s;ide rea&s;oned, they were accu&s;ed: if they attempted to defend them&s;elves
<PB N="111" REF="034483_0311_0FFDEB62CF8ACA50">
they were called to order, loaded with abu&s;e by the galleries, and even &s;pit upon: if, indignant at this treat|ment, they appealed to their con&s;tituents, they were called con&s;pirators, and clubs and pi&s;tols were held up in their faces; and yet, now they are on their trial, it is &s;aid they governed. What have they done at their own plea&s;ure?&mdash;Nothing whatever: they could not then be either in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, or leading men in the Convention. Their &s;peeches in the king's affair &s;uffi|ciently prove their good &s;en&s;e, and their de&s;ire of e&s;tab|li&s;hing a republic by wi&s;dom rather than blood. I &s;hall not enter into an examination of tho&s;e &s;peeches: it is nece&s;&s;ary to read them to form a judgment of their merit. All the&s;e things will no doubt be appreciated by po&s;terity without partiality: it will &s;ee, that forgetting them&s;elves, they calculated for its advantage; it will ho|nour their memory, and &s;trew flowers upon their graves; a vain and tardy homage, which cannot re&s;tore life to tho&s;e who have lo&s;t it; but of which the hope affords con&s;olation to tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to de&s;truc|tion for the good of their country.</P>
<P>THE murder of le Pelletier is &s;till a kind of my&s;tery: but I &s;hall never forget two facts, which I will men|tion here: the fir&s;t is, that all the members, at pre&s;ent pro&s;cribed, were afflicted beyond mea&s;ure at that event. I &s;aw Buzot and Louvet &s;hed tears of rage, per&s;uaded that &s;ome bold mountaineer had done the deed with a view of a&s;cribing it to the members of the right &s;ide, and of exciting again&s;t them the revolutionary fanatici&s;m of the people. The &s;econd is, that Gor&s;as, expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="112" REF="034483_0312_0FFDEB645EB74FD0">
this opinion in tolerably clear terms, added, that either the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in would never be di&s;covered at all, or that he would be found dead. It is certain that a Pari&s;ian Moun|taineer, di&s;patched with another per&s;on in pur&s;uit of Paris, did not overtake him till he came to an inn in Nor|mandy, where they &s;aid that he had blown out his brains. It is certain al&s;o, that the Mountain made a kind of &s;aint of le Pelletier, who certainly little expected &s;uch an honour. A man of a weak mind, and great opulence, he had gone over to them through fear, like Heraut|de-Sechelles, and other <HI>ci-dovant</HI> nobles of the &s;ame cha|racter; and was only of u&s;e to them by the manner of his death. Its effect was &s;uch as the right &s;ide had fore|&s;een; and this is an additional rea&s;on for being &s;atisfied that the fugitives are not the authors of that of Marat, even if it were not ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that courage like Charlotte Corday's could be a&s;&s;umed at any man's bid|ding. Be&s;ides, con&s;idering the circum&s;tances of the times, and their intention of coming to Paris, their hav|ing any &s;hare in the immolation of Marat would have been a mo&s;t dangerous act of folly. To this we may add, that men, abhorrent of blood, endeavouring to re|pre&s;s murder, pillage, and all other exce&s;&s;es, and bold enough to defy their adver&s;aries to their faces, are not likely to have recour&s;e to &s;uch means; while they are natural enough to Danton, who drew up the li&s;ts of the ma&s;&s;acres of September at his own hou&s;e, and di&s;per&s;ed the eulogium of them under his own covers, as well as to his coadjutors, the members of the Committee of Vi|gilance, who were the directors of that bloody bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>IT is truly curious to &s;ee how Amar, the reporter, confounds dates, facts, and per&s;onages.

I will go further: I will venture to affirm, that with Roland's activity, and his vigilant corre&s;pondence, the troubles in la Vend&eacute;e would never have had time to get to any head: it was Garrat's want of energy that en|couraged their growth. I know from his fir&s;t clerk, that in the beginning of the civil war, that weak mi|ni&s;ter was &s;trangely tardy in his proceedings. Cham|pagneux pointed out to him the rapid means proper to be employed; but Garat, always uncertain how to act, adopted no plan, and &s;uffered a &s;park to kindle a conflagration.</P>
<P>AMAR pretends that the fugitives, after their pro&s;crip|tion, attempted to a&s;&s;emble in la Vend&eacute;e. What was there then to prevent them, if &s;o inclined? They would

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>To be, or not to be, that is the que&s;tion.</L>
<L>It will &s;oon be re&s;olved in regard to me.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IS life a property which belongs to us? I think it is; but that property is given us upon conditions in regard to which alone we are liable to error.</P>
<P>WE are born to &s;eek happine&s;s for our&s;elves and to contribute to that of others: the &s;ocial &s;tate extends this de&s;tination, as well as all our other faculties, without creating any thing new.</P>
<P>AS long as we have a field before us in which we can practi&s;e virtue, and give a great example, it becomes us not to quit it; for courage con&s;i&s;ts in continuing our career in &s;pite of misfortune. But if malevolence mark out the limits of that career, we are free to &s;top &s;hort of them, e&s;pecially when the fortitude with which we might undergo the la&s;t efforts of its rage can be conducive to no advantage. When I was put in confinement, I flatter|ed my&s;elf that I &s;hould contribute to my hu&s;band's glory, and help to enlighten the public, if brought to trial. But it was then I &s;hould have been tried, and our per&s;ecutors were too dexterous to take &s;o bad a time. They were circum&s;pect as long as they had any thing to fear from tho&s;e, who, having fled from their violence, in&s;pired the departments with zeal in their defence. But now that terror holds its iron &s;ceptre over a &s;ubjugated world, in|&s;olent guilt no longer delays its triumph; it deludes, it oppre&s;&s;es, and the gaping multitude wonders at its power.

An immen&s;e city, fed upon blood and fal&s;ehood, furiou&s;ly applauds abominable pro&s;criptions, on which it &s;tupidly imagines its &s;alvation to depend.</P>
<P>TWO months ago, I a&s;pired to the honour of a&s;cending the &s;caffold; the victim was then allowed to &s;peak, and the energy of a courageous mind might have been &s;er|viceable to the cau&s;e of truth. Now all is lo&s;t!&mdash;This generation, rendered ferocious by infamous preachers of carnage, looks upon the friends of mankind as con&s;pi|rators, and con&s;iders as its champions tho&s;e abject wretch|es, who cover their vile pa&s;&s;ions and their cowardice with the ma&s;k of frantic enthu&s;ia&s;m. To live in the mid&s;t of it, is ba&s;ely to &s;ubmit to its horrible government, and to give room for the commi&s;&s;ion of new atrocities.</P>
<P>I KNOW that the reign of the wicked cannot be of long duration: they generally &s;urvive their power, and almo&s;t always undergo the puni&s;hment they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>UNKNOWN and overlooked, I might in &s;olitude and &s;ilence have withdrawn my&s;elf from the horrors which rend the bo&s;om of my country, and have waited in the practice of dome&s;tic virtues, for the period of its misfor|tunes. But a pri&s;oner, and marked out as a victim, I &s;hall only, by prolonging my exi&s;tence, afford a new gratification to tyranny.</P>
<P>LET us deceive it then, &s;ince it is not to be over|thrown.</P>
<P>FORGIVE me, re&s;pectable man, for di&s;po&s;ing of a life which I had devoted to you: your misfortunes would have attached me to it, if I had been permitted to alle|viate them. But I am robbed for ever of the power

of doing &s;o, and you lo&s;e nothing but a &s;hadow, an u&s;ele&s;s object of affliction and inquietude.</P>
<P>FORGIVE me, my dear child, young and tender girl, who&s;e &s;weet image is impre&s;&s;ed on my maternal heart, and &s;taggers my re&s;olution. Oh! certainly, I would not have deprived you of your guide, if it had been po&s;&s;ible that they would have let her remain with you: the cruel wretches! have they any pity upon innocence!&mdash;But do what they will, they cannot rob you of my example; and I feel, and I will venture to &s;ay, upon the very brink of the grave, that it is a rich inheritance.</P>
<P>ALL you, whom heaven in its bounty gave me for friends, direct your attentions towards my orphan. A young plant violently torn from her native &s;oil, &s;he would have withered perhaps, or have been brui&s;ed by the hand of the &s;poiler; but you placed her in a kindly &s;helter, and beneath a reviving &s;hade: there may &s;he flouri&s;h, and may her beauty and her virtues repay your care! &mdash;Do not grieve at a re&s;olution which puts an end to my &s;ufferings: I can bear adver&s;ity: you know me, and you will not believe that weakne&s;s or fear have promted my deci&s;ion. If any one could a&s;&s;ure me that before the tribunal at which &s;o many ju&s;t men are arraigned, I &s;hould be allowed to point out our oppre&s;&s;ors, I would appear there with plea&s;ure; but experience has too well &s;hewn that the vain formality of judgment is only an in|&s;ulting parade in which they take care to refu&s;e the vic|tim the privilege of &s;peech<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Look at Gor&s;as; he is condemned; he is about to die; he is in their hands; they forbade him to &s;peak: &s;uch is the fate of the courageous apo&s;tles of liberty!</NOTE>.

<P>THE time foretold is come, when their cries for bread are appea&s;ed with dead bodies: their degraded nature is regaled by the &s;pectacle, and the gratification of this brutal appetite will render the &s;carcity of bread &s;upport|able, until it &s;hall exceed the &s;ufferance of nature.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, &s;ome one may &s;ay, the&s;e dominators of the pre&s;ent day, who &s;acrifice every thing to their fears, may not extend their fury &s;o far as you.&mdash;Why, do you not &s;ee that they have purpo&s;ely provided the means of do|ing &s;o by compri&s;ing me in the ab&s;urd indictment again&s;t the republicans whom they dete&s;t?</P>

<P>OH! if tho&s;e pu&s;illanimous beings, tho&s;e men un|worthy of the name, who&s;e weakne&s;s a&s;&s;umed the di&s;|gui&s;e of prudence, and ruined the e&s;timable <HI>twenty-two,</HI> if they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my courage, they would have re|deemed the fir&s;t faults of their conduct; they would have provoked on the &s;econd of June, by a formal op|po&s;ition, the impri&s;onment to which they have ju&s;t been con&s;igned.

<P>THE cowards, they entered into a compromi&s;e with guilt!&mdash;It was decreed that they &s;hould fall in their turn; but they fall ingloriou&s;ly, unpitied by any, and with nothing to hope for from po&s;terity, but its perfect con|tempt. Why, in this la&s;t conjuncture, rather than obey their tyrants, de&s;cend to their bar, walk out of the a&s;&s;em|bly like a timid flock marked for &s;laughter by the butcher, and &s;ubmit to be taken into cu&s;tody&mdash;why did they not do them&s;elves ju&s;tice by falling upon the mon&s;ters, and expunging them from the face of the earth?</P>

Let the teacher of the harp be kept a few months longer: by that time, if circum&s;tances will not admit of further expence, the dear little girl, by making good u&s;e of her time, will know enough for her own amu&s;ement.

<P>YOU cannot imagine, dear Jany, all the vexation I have &s;uffered at not being able to write to you at my ea&s;e, nor even to read your letter at lei&s;ure: I perceived that I had an officer clo&s;e at my heels, and was afraid on your account. I am like a per&s;on infected with the plague. I have no longer any thing to lo&s;e, but I am frightened out of my wits for tho&s;e who acco&s;t me; in|&s;omuch that ye&s;terday at the court of ju&s;tice, I was in doubt whether I &s;hould return the &s;alute of a man whom I recollected, and whom I thought highly imprudent for &s;hewing me politene&s;s in public.&mdash;I was pre&s;ent at the reading of tho&s;e articles of impeachment, a prodigy of delu&s;ion, or rather a ma&s;terpiece of perfidy. As &s;oon as they had been read, the advocate, Chauveau, ob&s;erved in terms of great moderation, that, contrary to all form of law, the documents on which they were founded had
<PB N="129" REF="034483_0329_0FFDEB9298AB46F0">
not been communicated to the pri&s;oners' coun&s;el. He therefore begged the tribunal to take the matter into con&s;ideration, and give orders for their delivery. After a moment's whi&s;pering, the pre&s;ident made an&s;wer, in a faltering voice, that the papers in que&s;tion were for the mo&s;t part &s;ealed up at the hou&s;es of the accu&s;ed; that orders would be given to proceed to the removal of the &s;eals, and that in the mean time the trial would be|gin. Yes, Jany, I heard this very di&s;tinctly with my own ears! I looked about to &s;ee if it were not a dream, and I a&s;ked of my&s;elf whether po&s;terity would believe the&s;e things if they &s;hould come to its knowledge?&mdash; Well, the people felt nothing of all this; they did not perceive the atrocity of &s;uch conduct; the ab&s;urdity of bringing forward a charge and of withholding the vouch|ers of its truth; the &s;tupidity of pretending that tho&s;e vouchers are at the hou&s;es of the accu&s;ed, of who&s;e papers as yet no inventory has been taken; and the folly and impudence of confe&s;&s;ing it. The pre&s;ident mut|tered a few words be&s;ides concerning the immen&s;e num|ber of the other papers, and the difficulty of commu|nicating them; but that was neither more ju&s;t, nor le&s;s ab&s;urd. The witne&s;&s;es were then &s;ent out of court, that they might be called in their turns to make the depo&s;i|tion: my time is not yet come, but probably may to-mor|row. I can perceive nothing, in the&s;e proceedings, but the intention of taking advantage of the truths I may have the courage to tell, to effect my ruin, which, con|&s;idering the villains I have to deal with, and my con|tempt of death, is by no means difficult. Perhaps then
<PB N="130" REF="034483_0330_0FFDEB954D518FA8">
we are doomed to meet no more. My friend&s;hip be|queaths to you the care of my memory. If I could think of any thing more conformable to the genero&s;ity of your &s;entiments, which I have known too late, I would charge you with it: but why, my dear Jany, known too late? It was Providence that conducted every thing: had I earlier known your worth, my affection for you would have involved you in my misfortunes. You will di&s;po&s;e of every thing for the be&s;t. A fall out of the window may be &s;uppo&s;ed, and tho&s;e who will not believe it may be &s;ent to &s;ee. As there are many workmen, ma&s;ons and others, nothing is more ea&s;y than to ima|gine, that one of them, or &s;omebody di&s;gui&s;ed like one of them, &s;tole, at a certain hour under my window, and received the parcel.&mdash;This idea is indeed a very good one, and carries with it an air of probability. The <HI>por|traits, anecdotes,</HI> and other detached pieces, &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the public as materials to be worked up in better times. The little <HI>depot</HI> ought not to be neg|lected: it &s;hould be added to the ma&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE being &s;ummoned as a witne&s;s previou&s;ly to the being judicially accu&s;ed, forces me to adopt a different mode of proceeding from that on which I had de|termined when I gave you my will, and for which I had already made my preparations: I will then drain the bitter cup to the la&s;t drop. Farewell, Jany, fare|well!</P>

<P>YOUR letter, my dear Bo&s;c, was highly welcome: it di&s;covers to me your whole heart, and the full extent
<PB N="131" REF="034483_0331_0FFDEB97F66F0B18">
of your attachment: they are both as uncommon, in my e&s;timation, as they are dear to me. We do not however differ &s;o much as you imagine; we did not under&s;tand each other perfectly. It was not my inten|tion to depart at that moment, but to procure the means of doing &s;o when I &s;hould deem it fitting. I was de|&s;irous of rendering homage to the truth, as I have it in my power to do, and then to make my <HI>exit</HI> ju&s;t before the la&s;t ceremony. I thought it noble to deceive the tyrants. I had long ruminated on the project; and I &s;wear to you, that it was not in&s;pired by weakne&s;s. I am perfectly well; my head is as cool, and my &s;pirit as unbroken, as ever. True it is, however, that the pre|&s;ent trial embitters my &s;orrows, and inflames my indig|nation. I thought that the fugitives al&s;o had been taken up. It is po&s;&s;ible that deep grief, and the exalta|tion of &s;entiments already terrible, might have matured in the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of my heart a re&s;olution, to which my mind did not fail to a&s;cribe the mo&s;t excellent mo|tives.</P>
<P>CALLED upon to give evidence in this affair, I thought it nece&s;&s;arily called for a different mode of proceed|ing. I was determined to avail my&s;elf of the opportu|nity to reach the gaol with greater celerity: I intended to thunder, and then to withdraw from their power. I thought the very circum&s;tance would authorize me to &s;peak without re&s;erve, and that I ought to have it in my pocket when going into court. I did not however wait for it to &s;upport my character. During the hours of ex|pectation I pa&s;&s;ed in the clerk's office, in the mid&s;t of ten
<PB N="132" REF="034483_0332_0FFDEB9AA8C9D560">
per&s;ons, <HI>officers, judges</HI> of the other &s;ections, &amp;c. and in the hearing of <HI>Hebert</HI> and <HI>Chabot,</HI> who came into the next room, I &s;poke with equal energy and freedom. My turn to be heard did not come; they were to fetch me the &s;econd day; the third however is almo&s;t over, and nobody has yet appeared. I fear the&s;e knaves perceive that I may po&s;&s;ibly furni&s;h an intere&s;ting epi&s;ode, and think that, after having &s;ummoned me, it is better to reject my evidence.</P>
<P>I WAIT with impatience, and am now afraid I &s;hall not have an opportunity of acknowledging my friends in their pre&s;ence. You are of opinion, my dear Bo&s;c, that in either ca&s;e I ought to wait for, and not accelerate the cata&s;trophe: it is on this alone we are not perfectly agreed. It &s;eems to me, there would be weakne&s;s in receiving the <HI>coup-de-grace</HI> from the hands of others, in&s;tead of taking it from my own; and in expo&s;ing my|&s;elf to the in&s;olent clamours of a brutal populace, as un|worthy of &s;uch an example as it is incapable of turning it to account. No doubt it would have been right to do &s;o three months ago; but now it will be lo&s;t on the pre&s;ent generation; and as to po&s;terity, the other re&s;o|lution, well managed, will have quite as good an effect.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee that you did not under&s;tand me. Examine then the matter in the &s;ame point of view in which it &s;trikes me: it is not all the &s;ame as that in which you &s;ee it. When you &s;hall thus have maturely con&s;idered it, I will abide by your determination.</P>
<P>I HASTEN to conclude, that you may have my an&s;wer by the &s;ame conveyance; it is enough for me to have
<PB N="133" REF="034483_0333_0FFDEB9D55910AB8">
indicated what you will be able to inve&s;tigate in the lei|&s;ure of meditation.&mdash;My poor little girl! Where then is &s;he? Let me know, I beg of you: &s;end me a few par|ticulars, that my mind's eye at lea&s;t may &s;ee her in her new &s;ituation. Affected by your cares, you think that I feel likewi&s;e the cruelty of all the&s;e circum&s;tances. I under&s;tand that my brother-in-law is in confinement: no doubt the &s;eque&s;tration of his property is &s;till in force, and perhaps he is in danger of bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>CONSIDER that your friend&s;hip, which finds the ta&s;k I impo&s;e upon it a painful one, may ea&s;ily deceive you, as to what you can or ought to do in that re&s;pect. Try to think of the matter, as if it were neither you nor I, but two indifferent per&s;ons, in our relative &s;ituations, &s;ub|mitted to your impartial judgment. Attend to my for|titude; weigh my rea&s;ons; calculate coolly; and recollect how little a mob is worth that is capable of fea&s;ting upon &s;uch a &s;ight.</P>
<P>I EMBRACE you tenderly. Jany will tell you what it is po&s;&s;ible to attempt &s;ome morning, but take care not to run any hazard.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES On my Trial, and the Examination by which it began.</HEAD>
<P>AT the fir&s;t moment of my confinement, I thought of writing to Duperret, to beg him to get &s;ome attention paid to my complaints. Without being intimate, I had ob&s;erved
<PB REF="034483_0334_0FFDEBA007F7B028">
in a revolution from a conformity of principles. I was not deceived: Duperret an&s;wered me with kindne&s;s and warmth; and added, to the expre&s;&s;ions of his own &s;entiments, &s;ome intelligence concerning the &s;tate of pub|lic affairs, and the fugitive deputies. I thanked him; and, in replying to the pa&s;&s;age that related to our friends, expre&s;&s;ed my wi&s;hes for their &s;afety, and for that of my country. A few days after, having printed the exami|nation which I had undergone before an admini&s;trator of the police at the Abbey, I &s;ent a copy to Duperret; and took that opportunity of te&s;tifying my contempt for the &s;illy lies which Hebert had ju&s;t told in &s;peaking of me in his <HI>Pere Duche&s;ne.</HI> The whole of our corre&s;pondence might amount to three or four &s;hort letters including a note, in which I acquainted Duperret, as I acquainted at the time &s;everal other per&s;ons, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to take an intere&s;t in my welfare, with the &s;udden transfor|mation of my enlargement from the Abbey, into a new confinement at Sainte-Pelagie. It is on this corre&s;pond|ence they mean to found an accu&s;ation again&s;t me, as having been connected, indirectly at lea&s;t, with the rebels of Calvados. The very day of Bri&s;&s;ot's execution I was removed to the <HI>Conciergerie,</HI> put into a noi&s;ome room, and forced to &s;leep in a bed without &s;heets, which a fellow pri&s;oner was good enough to lend me. The day after I was examined in the office of the tri|bunal,
<PB N="135" REF="034483_0335_0FFDEBA2B3B1E6E8">
by judge David, accompanied by the public ac|cu&s;er, and in the pre&s;ence of a man whom I &s;u&s;pect to be a juror. At fir&s;t they a&s;ked me many tedious que&s;tions concerning Roland before the 14th of July, 1789; who was mayor of Lyons when he was mu|nicipal officer, &amp;c.&mdash;I an&s;wered tho&s;e que&s;tions by an exact relation of facts; but from that very moment I could perceive, while a&s;king many particulars, they did not wi&s;h me to be circum&s;tantial in my an|&s;wers. Without any tran&s;ition, I was a&s;ked, if dur|ing the Convention I had not been in the habit of &s;eeing &s;uch and &s;uch members (and the pro&s;cribed and condemned were named); and if in their conferences I had not heard them mention a departmental force, and the means of obtaining it. I had to remark that I had &s;een &s;ome of tho&s;e members as friends, with whom Roland had been intimate from the time of the con&s;ti|tuent a&s;&s;embly; others by accident, either as acquaint|ance, or becau&s;e brought to our hou&s;e by their col|leagues; and that &s;everal of them I had never &s;een at all: that be&s;ides there had never been any &s;ecret coun|cils or conferences at Roland's; but the conver&s;a|tion was public, and turned on matters which en|gaged the attention of the A&s;&s;embly, and intere&s;ted every body. The debate was long and violent be|fore I could get my an&s;wers taken down. They de&s;ired me to confine my&s;elf to <HI>yes</HI> and <HI>no</HI>; accu&s;ed me of being talkative; and told me I was not &s;hewing my wit at the hotel of the Interior. The public ac|cu&s;er and the judge, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t, behaved with
<PB N="136" REF="034483_0336_1000F6590F7857A8">
the po&s;itivene&s;s and acrimony of per&s;ons per&s;uaded that they had a great criminal before them, and impa|tient for her conviction. When the judge had a&s;ked a que&s;tion, and the public accu&s;er did not find it to his liking, he couched it in other terms, extended and ren|dered it complex and captious, interrupted my an&s;wers, and required them to be more conci&s;e: it was down|right per&s;ecution. I was kept about three hours, or rather more, after which the examination was &s;u&s;pended, to be re&s;umed, as I was told, in the evening. I am waiting for it. A determination to de&s;troy me &s;eems evident.&mdash;I will not prolong my life by any ba&s;e &s;ub|terfuge; neither will I lay bare my bo&s;om to malevo|lence; nor facilitate, by a &s;illy complai&s;ance, the labours of the public accu&s;er, who &s;eems de&s;irous of my fur|ni&s;hing him by my an&s;wers with matter for the indict|ment which his zeal meditates again&s;t me.</P>
<P>TWO days after, I was &s;ent for to be re-examined. The fir&s;t que&s;tion turned upon the pretended contra|diction that exi&s;ted between my letters to Duperret, and my having &s;aid I was not particularly intimate with him; whence it re&s;ulted, that I di&s;gui&s;ed the truth in regard to my political connexions with the rebels. I an&s;wered that I had never &s;een Duperret ten times in my life, and not even once in private, as it was ea&s;y to per|ceive by the fir&s;t letter I addre&s;&s;ed to him, when &s;end|ing him a copy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that I had written to the Conven|tion: that the &s;ub&s;equent letters were the con&s;equence of the kind and explicit an&s;wer I had then received, &amp;c. That at the period our little corre&s;pondence began
<PB N="137" REF="034483_0337_1000F63DA3E5D5A8">
there was no que&s;tion of revolt and rebellion; and at that time I had no room for a choice in the a&s;&s;embly, where there was &s;carcely any per&s;on to whom I was known, or who would have undertaken the care of my intere&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Who were the common friends of your|&s;elf and Duperret?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Barbaroux in particular.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Was it known to you that Roland, before he entered into the admini&s;tration, belonged to the Com|mittee of Corre&s;pondence of the Jacobins?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Was it not you who took upon you to compo&s;e the letters it was his duty to draw up for the Committee?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> My hu&s;band never borrowed my thoughts, although he may &s;ometimes have employed my pen.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Were you not acquainted with the office for the <HI>formation of public &s;pirit,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by Roland to corrupt the departments; to bring to Paris a de|partmental force; to tear the republic to pieces, accord|ing to the plans of a liberticide faction, &amp;c.; and was it not you who conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s of that office?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Roland e&s;tabli&s;hed no office under that de|nomination; and I conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s of none. Af|ter the decree, pa&s;&s;ed at the latter end of Augu&s;t, or|dering him to di&s;per&s;e u&s;eful writings, he a&s;&s;igned to &s;ome of his clerks the care of forwarding them, exert|ing him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in the execution of a law which tended to diffu&s;e the knowledge and the love of the revolution. This he called the <HI>patriotic corre&s;pon|dence;</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="034483_0338_1000F63F51EE31D8">
and as to his own writings, in&s;tead of promoting di&s;cord, they all breathed a de&s;ire to concur in the main|tenance of order, and of peace.</P>
<P>HERE it was ob&s;erved, it was in vain for me to at|tempt to di&s;gui&s;e the truth, as it evidently appeared, by all my an&s;wers, I was de&s;irous of doing; that upon the door of the very office was a ridiculous in&s;cription, and that I was not &s;o great a &s;tranger to my hu&s;band's tran&s;actions as not to know it; that my endeavours to ju&s;tify Roland would be equally ineffectual; and fa|tal experience had but too well &s;hown the mi&s;chief that perfidious mini&s;ter had done, by a&s;per&s;ing the mo&s;t faith|ful repre&s;entatives of the people, and by exciting the departments to take up arms again&s;t Paris.</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wered, that far from de&s;iring to di&s;gui&s;e the truth, I was proud of doing homage to it, even at the ri&s;k of my life; that I had never read the in&s;crip|tion in que&s;tion; on the contrary, I had remarked at the time the report of it was in circulation, that it was not to be found in the printed li&s;ts of offices belonging to the interior department; and that, in an&s;wer to the injurious imputations upon Roland, I had only two facts to oppo&s;e; the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> his <HI>writings,</HI> which all con|tained the be&s;t principles of morality and <HI>politics</HI>; the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> his forwarding all tho&s;e printed by order of the National Convention, even the &s;peeches of the mem|bers of that a&s;&s;embly, who pa&s;&s;ed for the mo&s;t violent in oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Do you know at what time Roland left Pa|ris, and where he may be?</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="034483_0339_1000F6423483E0D0"><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Whether I do or not, is what I neither ought or choo&s;e to tell.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved, this ob&s;tinacy in con&s;tantly di&s;|gui&s;ing the truth, proved I thought Roland guilty; that I &s;et my&s;elf in open rebellion again&s;t the law; that I forgot the duty of a per&s;on accu&s;ed, whom it behoves above all to reveal the truth to ju&s;tice, &amp;c. The pub|lic accu&s;er, who put the que&s;tion, took care to accom|pany it, as he did every other he thought proper to a&s;k, with in&s;ulting epithets, and expre&s;&s;ions indicating anger. I attempted to an&s;wer; but he forbade details; and both he and the judge, endeavouring to avail them&s;elves of the kind of authority given by their office, employed all means to reduce me to &s;ilence, or to make me &s;ay what they thought fit. Indignant at the treatment, I told them I would complain in open court of their unheard of and captious mode of examination; that I would not &s;uffer my&s;elf to be brow-beaten; and that I con&s;idered the laws of rea&s;on and nature as &s;uperior to all human in|&s;titutions: then turning round to the clerk, 'Take up your pen,' &s;aid I, 'and write.'</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> 'A per&s;on accu&s;ed is an&s;werable for his own actions, but not for tho&s;e of others. If, during more than four months, Roland had not &s;olicited in vain the pa&s;&s;ing of his accounts, he would not now be ob|liged to ab&s;ent him&s;elf, nor &s;hould I, &s;uppo&s;ing me to be acquainted with it, be obliged to make a &s;ecret of his place of re&s;idence.&mdash;I know of no law which requires me to betray the deare&s;t &s;entiments of nature.'</P>
<P>HERE the public accu&s;er exclaimed in a rage, that
<PB N="140" REF="034483_0340_1000F644D003A3D0">
there was no end to my loquacity; and here clo&s;ed the examination.</P>
<P>'HOW I pity you,' &s;aid I calmly. 'I forgive you even the di&s;agreeable things you &s;ay: you think you have a great criminal before you, and are impatient to convict her. How unfortunate is the man who en|tertains &s;uch prejudices! You may &s;end me to the &s;caf|fold; but you cannot deprive me of the &s;atisfaction I de|rive from a good con&s;cience, nor of the per&s;ua&s;ion that po&s;terity will revenge Roland and me, by devoting his per&s;ecutors to infamy.' Being de&s;ired to choo&s;e my advocate, I named Chauveau, and retired, &s;aying to them with a &s;mile, 'I wi&s;h you, in return for all the ill you mean to do to me, the &s;ame peace of mind I enjoy, whatever may be the reward attached to it.'</P>
<P>THE examination took place in a room called the council-chamber, at a table with &s;everal per&s;ons &s;itting round it, who appeared to be there for the purpo&s;e of writing, and who did nothing but li&s;ten to what I &s;aid. There were many goers and comers; nor could any thing be le&s;s &s;ecret than the tran&s;action.</P>

<HEAD>DRAUGHT OF A DEFENCE INTENDED TO BE READ TO THE TRIBUNAL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Written at the <HI>Conciergerie</HI> the night after her examination.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THE charge brought again&s;t me re&s;ts entirely upon the pretended fact of my being the accomplice of men called con&s;pirators. My intimacy with a few of them is of
<PB N="141" REF="034483_0341_1000F64668E9C910">
much older date than the political circum&s;tances, in con|&s;equence of which they are now con&s;idered as rebels; and the corre&s;pondence we kept up through the medium of our common friends, at the time of their departure from Paris, was entirely foreign to public affairs. Pro|perly &s;peaking, I have been engaged in no political cor|re&s;pondence whatever, and in that re&s;pect I might con|fine my&s;elf to a &s;imple denial; for I certainly cannot be called upon to give an account of my particular affections. But I have a right to be proud of them, as well as of my conduct, nor do I wi&s;h to conceal any thing from the public eye. I &s;hall therefore acknowledge, that, with expre&s;&s;ions of regret at my confinement, I received an intimation that Duperret had two letters for me, whe|ther written by one or by two of my friends, before or after their leaving Paris, I cannot &s;ay. Duperret had de|livered them into other hands, and they never came to mine. Another time I received a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to break my chains, and an offer of &s;ervices, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in effecting my e&s;cape in any way I might think proper, and to convey me whither&s;oever I might afterwards wi&s;h to go. I was di&s;&s;uaded from li&s;tening to &s;uch propo&s;als by duty and by honour; by duty, that I might not en|danger the &s;afety of tho&s;e to who&s;e care I was confided; and by honour becau&s;e at all events I preferred running the ri&s;k of an unju&s;t trial, to expo&s;ing my&s;elf to the &s;u&s;picion of guilt by a &s;light, unworthy of me. When I con&s;ented to be taken up on the 31&s;t of May, it was not with the intention of afterwards making my e&s;cape. In that alone con&s;i&s;ts all my corre&s;pondence with my
<PB N="142" REF="034483_0342_1000F6491BCC2278">
fugitive friends. No doubt, if all means of communi|cation had not been cut off, or if I had not been pre|vented by confinement, I &s;hould have endeavoured to learn what was become of them; for I know of no law by which my doing &s;o is forbidden. In what age, or in what nation, was it ever con&s;idered a crime to be faithful to tho&s;e &s;entiments of e&s;teem and brotherly af|fection which bind man to man? I do not pretend to judge of the mea&s;ures of tho&s;e who have been pro&s;cribed, they are unknown to me; but I will never believe in the evil intentions of men, of who&s;e probity, civi&s;m, and devotion to their country, I am thoroughly convinced. If they erred it was unwittingly; they fall without being aba&s;ed; and I regard them as unfortunate without being liable to blame. I am perfectly ea&s;y as to their glory, and willingly con&s;ent to participate in the honour of be|ing oppre&s;&s;ed by their enemies. I know tho&s;e men, ac|cu&s;ed of con&s;piring again&s;t their country, to have been determined republicans, but humane, and per&s;uaded that good laws were nece&s;&s;ary to procure the republic the good-will of per&s;ons who doubted whether it could be maintained; which it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed is more difficult than to kill them. The hi&s;tory of every age proves, that it requires great talents to lead men to virtue by wi&s;e in&s;titutions, while force &s;uffices to oppre&s;s them by terror or to annihilate them by death. I have heard them a&s;&s;ert, that abundance, as well as happine&s;s, can only proceed from an equitable, protecting, and beneficent govern|ment; and that the omnipotence of the bayonet may produce fear, but not bread. I have &s;een them ani|mated
<PB N="143" REF="034483_0343_10019D5FE9B352D0">
by the mo&s;t lively enthu&s;ia&s;m for the good of the people, di&s;daining to flatter them, and re&s;olved rather to fall victims to their delu&s;ion than be the means of keep|ing it up. I confe&s;s the&s;e principles, and this con|duct appeared to me totally different from the &s;enti|ments and proceedings of tyrants or ambitious men, who &s;eek to plea&s;e the people to effect their &s;ubjugation. It in&s;pired me with the highe&s;t e&s;teem for tho&s;e generous men: this error, if an error it be, will accompany me to the grave, whither I &s;hall be proud of following tho&s;e whom I was not permitted to accompany.</P>
<P>MY defence, I will venture to &s;ay, is more nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e, who really wi&s;h to come at the truth, than it is to my&s;elf. Calm and contented in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done my duty, I look forward to futurity with perfect peace of mind. My &s;erious turn, and &s;tudious habits, have pre&s;erved me alike from the follies of di&s;&s;i|pation, and from the bu&s;tle of intrigue. A friend to liberty, on which reflection had taught me to &s;et a ju&s;t value, I beheld the revolution with delight, per&s;uaded it was de&s;tined to put an end to the arbitrary power I dete&s;ted, and to the abu&s;es I had &s;o often lament|ed, when reflecting with pity upon the fate of the indigent cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety. I took an intere&s;t in the pro|gre&s;s of the revolution, and &s;poke with warmth of pub|lic affairs; but I did not pa&s;s the bounds pre&s;cribed by my &s;ex. Some &s;mall talents perhaps, a con&s;iderable &s;hare of philo&s;ophy, a degree of courage more uncom|mon, and which did not permit me to weaken my hu&s;|band's energy in dangerous times: &s;uch perhaps are the
<PB N="144" REF="034483_0344_10019D5E66E1CFC8">
qualities which tho&s;e who know me may have indi&s;|creetly extolled, and which may have made me enemies among tho&s;e to whom I am unknown. Roland &s;ome|times employed me as a &s;ecretary; and the famous let|ter to the king, for in&s;tance, is copied entirely in my hand-writing: this would be an excellent count to add to my indictment, if the Au&s;trians were trying me, and if they &s;hould have thought fit to extend a mini&s;ter's re|&s;pon&s;ibility to his wife. But Roland long ago manife&s;ted his knowledge, and his attachment to the great principles of politics: the proofs of them exi&s;t in his numerous works, publi&s;hed during the la&s;t fifteen years.&mdash;His learn|ing and his probity are all his own, nor did he &s;tand in need of a wife to make him an able mini&s;ter. Never were conferences or &s;ecret councils held at his hou&s;e; his colleagues, whoever they might be, and a few friends and acquaintance, met once a week at his table, and there conver&s;ed in a public manner on matters in which every body was concerned. As to the re&s;t, the writings of that mini&s;ter, which breathe throughout a love of order and of peace, and which lay down in the mo&s;t forcible manner the be&s;t principles of morality and po|litics, will forever atte&s;t his wi&s;dom, as his accounts will prove his integrity.</P>
<P>TO return to the offence imputed to me, I have to ob&s;erve that I never was intimate with Duperret. I &s;aw him now and then at the time of Roland's admini|&s;tration; but he never came to our hou&s;e during the &s;ix months that my hu&s;band was no longer in office. The &s;ame remark will apply to the other members, our
<PB N="145" REF="034483_0345_10019D617580C700">
friends, which &s;urely does not accord with the plots and con&s;piracies laid to our charge. It is evident by my fir&s;t letter to Duperret, I only wrote to him becau&s;e I knew not to whom el&s;e to addre&s;s my&s;elf, and be|cau&s;e I imagined he would readily con&s;ent to oblige me. My corre&s;pondence with him could not then be concerted; it could not be the con&s;equence of any previous intimacy, and could have only one ob|ject in view. It gave me afterwards an opportunity of receiving accounts from tho&s;e who had ju&s;t ab&s;ented them&s;elves, and with whom I was connected by the ties of friend&s;hip, independently of all political con&s;ider|ations. The latter were totally out of the que&s;tion in the kind of corre&s;pondence I kept up with them during the early part of their ab&s;ence. No written memorial bears witne&s;s again&s;t me in that re&s;pect, tho&s;e ad|duced only leading to a belief that I partook of the opinions and &s;entiments of the per&s;ons called con&s;pira|tors. This deduction is well founded: I confe&s;s it with|out re&s;erve, and am proud of the conformity. But I never manife&s;ted my opinions in a way which can be con&s;trued into a crime, or which tended to occa&s;ion any di&s;turbance. Now, to become an accomplice in any plan whatever, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give advice, or to fur|ni&s;h means of execution. I have done neither; I am not then reprehen&s;ible in the eye of the law&mdash;there is no law to condemn me, nor any fact which admits of the application of a law.</P>
<P>I KNOW that in revolutions, law, as well as ju&s;tice, is often forgotten; and the proof of it is, that I am here.
<PB N="146" REF="034483_0346_1001F1FF48120A40">
I owe my trial to nothing but the prejudices, and vio|lent animo&s;ities which ari&s;e in times of great agitation, and which are generally directed again&s;t tho&s;e who have been placed in con&s;picuous &s;ituations, or are known to po&s;&s;e&s;s any energy or &s;pirit. It would have been ea&s;y for my courage to put me out of the reach of the &s;entence I fore&s;aw; but I thought it rather became me to undergo it: I thought that I owed the example to my country; I thought that if I were to be condemned, it mu&s;t be right to leave tyranny all the odium of &s;acrificing a woman who&s;e crime is that of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;mall talents which &s;he never mi&s;applied, a zealous de&s;ire of the welfare of mankind, and courage enough to ac|knowledge her unfortunate friends, and to do homage to virtue at the ri&s;k of her life. Minds which have any claim to greatne&s;s are capable of dive&s;ting them|&s;elves of &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations; they feel they be|long to the whole human race; and their views are di|rected to po&s;terity alone. I am the wi&s;e of a virtuous man expo&s;ed to per&s;ecution: and I was the friend of men who have been pro&s;cribed and immolated by delu|&s;ion, and the hatred of jealous mediocrity. It is nece&s;|&s;ary that I &s;hould peri&s;h in my turn, becau&s;e it is a rule with tyranny to &s;acrifice tho&s;e whom it has grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed, and to annihilate the very witne&s;&s;es of its mi&s;deeds. I have this double claim to death from your hands, and I expect it. When innocence walks to the &s;caffold, at the command of error and perver&s;ity, every &s;tep &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">akes is an advance towards glory. May I be the la&s;t victim &s;acrificed to the furious &s;pirit of party!

I &s;hall quit with joy this unfortunate earth, which &s;wal|lows up the friends of virtue, and drinks the blood of the ju&s;t.</P>
<P>TRUTH! friend&s;hip! my country! &s;acred objects, &s;entiments dear to my heart, accept my la&s;t &s;acrifice. My life was devoted to you, and you will render my death ea&s;y and glorious.</P>
<P>JUST heaven! enlighten this unfortunate people for whom I de&s;ired liberty. . . . . Liberty!&mdash;It is for noble minds, who de&s;pi&s;e death, and who know how upon occa&s;ion to give it to them&s;elves. It is not for weak beings who enter into a compo&s;ition with guilt, and cover &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and cowardice with the name of prudence. It is not for corrupt wretches who ri&s;e from the bed of debauchery, or from the mire of indigence, to fea&s;t their eyes on the blood that &s;treams from the &s;caffold. It is the portion of a people who delight in humanity, practi&s;e ju&s;tice, de&s;pi&s;e their flatterers, and re&s;pect the truth. While you are not &s;uch a people, O my fellow-citizens! you will talk in vain of liberty: in|&s;tead of liberty you will have licentiou&s;ne&s;s, of which you will all fall victims in your turns; you will a&s;k for bread; dead bodies will be given you; and you will at la&s;t bow down your necks to the yoke.</P>
<P>I HAVE neither concealed my &s;entiments nor my opi|nions. I know that a Roman lady was &s;ent to the &s;caf|fold for lamenting the death of her &s;on. I know that in times of delu&s;ion and party rage, he who dares avow him&s;elf the friend of the condemned or of the pro&s;cribed expo&s;es him&s;elf to their fate. But I de&s;pi&s;e death;

<P>THE indictment drawn up by the public accu&s;er again&s;t Mary-Jane Phlipon, wife of John-Mary Roland, aged thirty-nine years, born at Paris, and dwelling there, in the <HI>rue de la harpe,</HI> of which the tenor is as hereafter followeth:</P>
<P><HI>Antony-Quintin Fouquier-Tinville,</HI> public accu&s;er of the extraordinary criminal and revolutionary tribunal, (e&s;ta|bli&s;hed at Paris, by a decree of the national convention, of the 10th of March, the &s;econd year of the republic, without appeal to the tribunal of annulment) by virtue of the power to him given by the &s;econd article of ano|ther
<PB N="149" REF="034483_0349_0FFDEBC6182B3D98">
decree of the convention of the 5th of April fol|lowing, importing that the public accu&s;er of the &s;aid tri|bunal is authori&s;ed to arre&s;t, pro&s;ecute, and bring to judgment, on the denunciation of the con&s;tituted autho|rities and of citizens.</P>
<P>SHEWETH that the &s;word of the law has recently &s;truck &s;everal principal chiefs of the con&s;piracy which exi&s;ted again&s;t the liberty and &s;afety of the French peo|ple; but a great number of authors and accomplices of that con&s;piracy &s;till exi&s;t, and hitherto have found means, by a cowardly flight, to avoid the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of their crimes: of the number is Roland, ex-mini&s;ter of the home department, the principal agent of the con|&s;pirators. The flight of &s;ome of them did not put a &s;top to the corre&s;pondence between tho&s;e who re|mained at Paris, as well at liberty as in a &s;tate of ar|re&s;t: they corre&s;ponded al&s;o with tho&s;e who had taken refuge at Caen, and other cities of the republic. Ro|land on leaving Paris left behind him his wife, who, al|though put in confinement in a hou&s;e of arre&s;t, continued to corre&s;pond with the con&s;pirators who had retired to Caen, through the medium of another who remained at Paris. That intriguing woman, who is well known to have received, and a&s;&s;embled at her hou&s;e the princi|pal chiefs of the con&s;pirators in &s;ecret councils, of which &s;he was the &s;oul, received, although in pri&s;on, letters from Barbaroux and others of the refugees at Caen; and always an&s;wered them in terms favourable to the con|&s;piracy. Of this corre&s;pondence the proof exi&s;ts, Fir&s;t, in a letter dated from Evreux, the 13th of June la&s;t,
<PB N="150" REF="034483_0350_0FFDEBC8D23A4280">
written by Barbaroux to Lauze Duperret, in which he &s;ays:

<Q>You have no doubt executed my commi&s;&s;ion in regard to Madame Roland, by trying to convey to her &s;ome little con&s;olation.&mdash;Make an ef|fort to &s;ee her, and tell her, that the <HI>twenty-two</HI> pro&s;crib|ed, and all hone&s;t men, &s;hare her afflictions, &amp;c.

3dly, In a letter written by Lauze Duperret to the &s;aid wife of Roland, in which he &s;ays:
<Q>I have kept for &s;everal days three letters which Barbaroux and Buzot inclo&s;ed to me, without having it in my power to convey them to you; and what is &s;till more unfortunate, is, that at the moment I might avail my&s;elf of the means you afford me, the thing is become impo&s;&s;ible, as they are in the hands of Petion, to whom I thought it advi&s;e|able to deliver them, &s;uppo&s;ing he had it more in his power to forward them than any body el&s;e, and who &s;et off without being able &s;o to do. I &s;hall this very day give notice of it to tho&s;e citizens to whom I am going to write by a &s;afe conveyance, and &s;hall in|form them I have it now in my power to execute

4thly, In a note dated the 24th of June, written by the above wife of Roland to Duperret, in which &s;he acquaints him &s;he has been relea&s;ed from the abbey; that &s;he thought &s;he was going to return home; but that before &s;he reached it &s;he was taken up and conducted to Sainte-Pelagie. 5thly, and la&s;tly, in three other letters written by her in like manner to Lauze Duperret; the fir&s;t dated June 6, the &s;econd without date, and the third June 24. In the &s;econd &s;he &s;ays:
<Q>The accounts I receive from my friends are the only plea&s;ure I am &s;en&s;ible of: you have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in procuring me that plea&s;ure: tell them my confidence in their courage and knowledge of what they are capable of doing for liberty, &s;tands me in&s;tead of every thing, and con&s;oles me in all my misfortunes; tell them my e&s;teem, my attachment, and my good wi&s;hes, will follow them wherever they go.

<P>THE &s;entence was preceded for form's &s;ake, and ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of that horrible tribunal, by a mock trial <HI>(debats),</HI> in which madam Roland was not allowed to &s;peak, and in which hired ruffians vo|mited forth the mo&s;t atrocious calumnies before other ruffians, the execrable tools of Robe&s;pierre, &s;o unwor|thily honoured with the title of judges and jurors. I have not been able to procure a detail of the proceed|ings, which, as is well known, mu&s;t not be taken in writing: but I know that only one per&s;on paid a tri|bute to truth, and that he was &s;ome time after &s;ent on that account to the &s;caffold. I mean the worthy Le|cocq, who for eight months only had lived with Roland as a &s;ervant, and who&s;e excellent qualities de&s;erved a better fate.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="034483_0355_0FFDEBD686BC4228">MADAM Roland did not deceive the expectations of her friends. She was conducted to the &s;caffold with all the calmne&s;s of a great mind, &s;uperior to the idea of death and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ufficient power to overcome the natural horror of immediate di&s;&s;olution. To exhibit a picture of her la&s;t moments, I cannot do better than borrow the ele|gant and impre&s;&s;ive pen of Roiuffe. The following is the account he gives of them in his work intituled <HI>Memoires d'un d&ecirc;tenu, pour &s;ervir &aacute; l' hi&s;toire de la tyrannie de Robe|&s;pierre</HI>; a work which will furni&s;h hi&s;tory with more than one important delineation, and which will never be read without emotion.</P>
<P>"THE blood of the <HI>twenty-two</HI> was &s;till warm when madam Roland was brought to the <HI>Conciergerie.</HI> Well aware of the fate that awaited her peace of mind continued undi&s;turbed. Though pa&s;t the prime of life, &s;he was &s;till a charming woman: &s;he was tall and of elegant make; and her countenance was expre&s;&s;ive; but her misfortunes and long confinement had left traces of melancholy on her face, which tempered its natu|ral vivacity. She had the &s;oul of a republican in a body made up of graces, and fa&s;hioned by a certain courtly &s;tyle of politene&s;s. Something more than is ge|nerally found in the eyes of women beamed from hers, which were large, dark, and full of &s;oftne&s;s and expre&s;|&s;ion. She often &s;poke to me at the grate with the freedom and energy of a great man. This republican language, from the mouth of a pretty French woman, for whom the &s;caffold was preparing, was one of the miracles of the revolution to which we were not then

She always &s;poke of the mem|bers, who had ju&s;t been put to death, with re&s;pect; but &s;he &s;poke of them at the &s;ame time without feminine pity, and even reproached them with not having adopted mea&s;ures &s;ufficiently energetic. She generally &s;tyled them <HI>our friends,</HI> and often &s;ent for Claviere to con|ver&s;e with him. Sometimes her &s;ex would recover the a&s;cendance; and it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the recollection of her daughter and her hu&s;band had drawn tears from her eyes. This mixture of natural &s;oftne&s;s, and of for|titude, rendered her the more intere&s;ting. The wo|man who waited on her, &s;aid to me one day, '<HI>Before</HI> YOU <HI>&s;he calls up all her courage; but in her own room &s;he &s;ometimes &s;tands for hours together, leaning again&s;t her window and weeping.</HI>' The day &s;he was &s;ent for to be examined, we &s;aw her pa&s;s with her u&s;ual firmne&s;s; but when &s;he returned the tears were gli&s;tening in her eyes: &s;he had been treated with &s;o much har&s;hne&s;s, and que&s;tions &s;o injurious to her honour had been a&s;ked her, that her tears and her indignation had bur&s;t forth together. A mercenary pedant coldly in&s;ulted this woman, celebrated for the excellence of her under&s;tanding, and who, at the bar of the National Convention, had reduced her ene|mies to &s;ilence, and forced them to admire the ea&s;y graces of her eloqence. She remained eight days at

the <HI>Conciergerie;</HI> and in that &s;hort time rendered her&s;elf dear to all the pri&s;oners, who &s;incerely deplored her fate.</P>
<P>THE day &s;he was condemned, &s;he was neatly dre&s;&s;|ed in white; and her long black hair flowed loo&s;ely to her wai&s;t. She would have moved the mo&s;t &s;avage heart, but tho&s;e mon&s;ters had no heart at all. Her dre&s;s, however, was not meant to excite pity; but was cho&s;en as a &s;ymbol of the purity of her mind. After her con|demnation, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through the wicket with a quick &s;tep, be&s;peaking &s;omething like joy; and indicated by an expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;ture, that &s;he was condemned to die. She had, for the companion of her misfortune, a man who&s;e fortitude was not equal to her own, but whom &s;he found means to in&s;pire with gaiety, &s;o cheering and &s;o real, that it &s;everal times brought a &s;mile upon his face.</P>
<P>AT the place of execution, &s;he bowed down before the &s;tatue of Liberty, and pronounced the&s;e memorable words: <HI>O Liberty, how many crimes are committed in thy name!</HI></P>
<P>SHE often &s;aid, that her hu&s;band would not &s;urvive her; and &s;oon after we learned in our dungeons, that the virtuous Roland had killed him&s;elf on the public road, thereby indicating his wi&s;h to die irreproachable in re|gard to courageous ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>MY heart, though &s;uffering many cruel torments in that horrible abode, felt nothing more &s;everely than the pang occa&s;ioned by the death of that celebrated wo|man.&mdash;The remembrance of her murder, added to that of my unfortunate friends, will make my mind a prey to incon&s;olable &s;orrow to the la&s;t period of my exi&s;tence.</P>

<Q>The Examination of Citizenne&s;s Roland at the Abbey, taken from Dulaure's paper called the Thermometre du Jour, of the <HI>21</HI>&s;t and <HI>22</HI>d June, <HI>1793.</HI></Q>

<P>I CONSIDER it as an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, whatever may be the prejudices of the public, to afford to per&s;ons ac|cu&s;ed the means of making known their ju&s;tification. This induces me to publi&s;h the examination of ma|dam Roland. None but cowards, and men &s;trangers to equity, can blame this conduct. DULAURE.</P>
<P>THE 12th of June, Louvet, an admini&s;trator of the police, repaired to the Abbey to examine madam Roland.</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Had you no knowledge of a plan for a fe|derative republic, and for detaching the departments from Paris?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I never heard of &s;uch a thing: I can &s;ay, on the contrary, that Roland, and all the per&s;ons I was in the habit of &s;eeing, con&s;tantly &s;poke in my pre&s;ence of the expediency of maintaining the unity of the republic, as tending to give it greater force; of the con&s;equent nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving an equilibrium between all the departments; of their wi&s;h that Pa|ris might do nothing to excite the jealou&s;y of the re&s;t; of their de&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>liberty</HI> prevail throughout France, and to concur in the maintenance of them.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> As a man in office, Roland &s;ometimes re|ceived a hundred per&s;ons in a day, not one of whom I &s;aw. As to my&s;elf, I never had any exten&s;ive circle of vi&s;itors; but &s;ometimes gave a dinner to my hu&s;band's colleagues, and to the per&s;ons with whom they were in any way connected.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Had you no knowledge of writings &s;ent to the departments to provoke them to ri&s;e again&s;t Paris?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I never heard of &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erved.</HI> That Roland while mini&s;ter had however formed offices <HI>of public opinion</HI> in the departments and it appeared that &s;ums of money were &s;et apart for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The fir&s;t part of the ob&s;ervation appears to me ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of foundation. As to the &s;econd, every body knows the mini&s;ter of the Interior was allowed a &s;um of money in order to di&s;per&s;e u&s;eful writings; and as Roland has given in his accounts, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee what writings were &s;ent to the depart|ments.</P>

li&s;t of tho&s;e writings than I am able to give. As to their contents, it belongs to the public, and not to me, to decide upon their merit.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erved.</HI> That Roland could not have given in his accounts, &s;ince he &s;o earne&s;tly &s;olicited permi&s;&s;ion to do &s;o, when de&s;irous of leaving Paris.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Not wi&s;hing to &s;uppo&s;e the per&s;on who examines me has any bad intention, I can only attri|bute the pre&s;ent ob&s;ervation to an extreme ignorance of facts. Roland not only delivered a monthly account to the convention, but on going out of office, gave in a general account, in which every thing was de|tailed in the mo&s;t particular manner. What he &s;o|licited was the pa&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e accounts, that is to &s;ay, their inve&s;tigation by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the con|vention, and &s;uch a report of them to that a&s;&s;embly as they might appear to de&s;erve. The committee of public accounts in con&s;equence impo&s;ed this ta&s;k on &s;e|veral of its members.</P>
<P>I ADDED, I knew that they had come repeatedly to the hotel of the Interior; that they had examined the minutes and vouchers; had been edified, as they needs mu&s;t, by the admini&s;tration of a man who&s;e in|tegrity and courage would long be the theme of prai&s;e; that it was Roland's mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire, as well as mine, that the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould make their report, and that I begged all good citizens to join me in my en|deavours to obtain it.</P>
<P>[I WAS interrupted in this an&s;wer: it was thought too long; and I was accu&s;ed of being ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imonious. I ob|&s;erved,

that I availed my&s;elf of my rights, and that there was no acrimony in informing tho&s;e who were igno|rant of Roland's having given in his accounts, that he had done &s;o long ago.]</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Have you had no connexion with traitors?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> All the per&s;ons I was acquainted with, were &s;o noted for their patrioti&s;m, that it was impo&s;&s;ible even to &s;u&s;pect them of any intercour&s;e with traitors.</P>

<P>HERE after a confinement of twelve days, for which no motive had been a&s;&s;igned, ended my examination, without my being told of what I was accu&s;ed or &s;u&s;pect|ed, and con&s;equently without my knowing on what facts I was to be que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>CONFIDENT that I had nothing to lo&s;e by telling the truth concerning my &s;entiments, and all the per&s;ons with whom I had been acquainted, I neglected to avail my&s;elf of my rights, and gave a plain and direct an&s;wer to every thing that was a&s;ked.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Pri&s;on of St. Pelagie,
<DATE>Aug. 9, 1793.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE daughter of an arti&s;t, the wife of a man of letters (who afterwards became a mini&s;ter, and remained an hone&s;t man), now a pri&s;oner, de&s;tined perhaps to a violent and unexpected death, I have been acquainted with happine&s;s and with adver&s;ity, I have &s;een glory at hand, and I have experienced in|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BORN in an ob&s;cure &s;tation, but of hone&s;t pa|rents, I &s;pent my youth in the bo&s;om of the fine arts, nouri&s;hed by the charms of &s;tudy, and igno|rant of all &s;uperiority but that of merit, of all great|ne&s;s but that of virtue.</P>
<P>ARRIVED at years of maturity, I lo&s;t all hopes of that fortune, which might have placed me in a con|dition &s;uitable to the education I had received. A
<PB N="4" REF="034483_0366_0FFDEBF2F0D74BC0">
marriage with a re&s;pectable man appeared to compen|&s;ate this lo&s;s; it &s;erved to lay the foundation of new misfortunes.</P>
<P>A GENTLE di&s;po&s;ition, a &s;trong mind, a &s;olid un|der&s;tanding, an extremely affe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ionate heart, and an exterior which announced there qualities, rendered me dear to all tho&s;e with whom I was acquainted. The &s;ituation into which I have been thrown has created me enemies; per&s;onally I have none: to tho&s;e who have &s;poken the wor&s;t of me I am utterly un|known.</P>
<P>IT is &s;o true that things are &s;eldom what they ap|pear to be, that the periods of my life in which I have felt the mo&s;t plea&s;ure, or experienced the greate&s;t vexation, were often the very contrary of tho&s;e that others might have &s;uppo&s;ed: the &s;olution is, that happine&s;s depends on the affections more than on events.</P>
<P>IT is my purpo&s;e to employ the lei&s;ure of my cap|tivity in retracing what has happened to me from my tendere&s;t infancy to the pre&s;ent moment. Thus to tread over again all the &s;teps of our career, is to live a &s;econd time; and what, in the gloom of a pri&s;on, can we do better than to tran&s;port our exi&s;tence el&s;e|where by plea&s;ing fictions, or by the recollection of in|tere&s;ting occurrences?</P>
<P>IF we gain le&s;s experience by acting, than by reflect|ing on what we &s;ee and do, mine will be greatly aug|mented by my pre&s;ent undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="034483_0367_0FFDEBF4815F41E0">PUBLIC affairs, and my own private &s;entiments, afforded me ample matter for thinking, and &s;ub|jects enough for my pen during two months im|pri&s;onment, without obliging me to have recour&s;e to di&s;tant times. Accordingly, the fir&s;t five weeks were devoted to my <HI>Hi&s;toric Notices,</HI> which formed perhaps no unintere&s;ting collection. They have ju&s;t been de&s;troyed; and I have felt all the bitterne&s;s of a lo&s;s, which I &s;hall never repair. But I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, could I &s;uffer my mind to &s;ink in any circum|&s;tances whatever. In all the troubles I have experi|enced, the mo&s;t lively impre&s;&s;ion of &s;orrow has been almo&s;t immediately accompanied by the ambition of oppo&s;ing my &s;trength to the evil, and of &s;urmount|ing it, either by doing good to others, or by exerting my own fortitude to the utmo&s;t. Thus misfortune may pur&s;ue, but cannot overwhelm me; tyrants may per&s;ecute, but never, no never &s;hall they deba&s;e me. My <HI>Hi&s;toric Notices</HI> are gone: I mean to write my <HI>Memoirs;</HI> and, prudently accommodating my&s;elf to my weakne&s;s, at a moment when my feelings are acute, I &s;hall talk of my own per&s;on, that my thoughts may be the le&s;s at home. I &s;hall exhibit my fair and my unfavourable &s;ide with equal freedom. He who dares not &s;peak well of him&s;elf is almo&s;t always a coward, who knows and dreads the ill that may be &s;aid of him; and he who he&s;itates to confe&s;s his faults, has neither &s;pirit to vindicate, nor virtue to repair them. Thus frank with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I &s;hall
<PB N="6" REF="034483_0368_0FFDEBF84AFFFE88">
not be &s;crupulous in regard to others: father, mother, friends, hu&s;band, I &s;hall paint them all in their proper colours, or in the colours, at lea&s;t in which they appear|ed to me.</P>
<P>WHILE I remained in a quiet and retired &s;tation, my natural &s;en&s;ibility &s;o ab&s;orbed my other qualities, that it di&s;played it&s;elf alone, or governed all the re&s;t. My fir&s;t objects were to plea&s;e and to do good. I was a little like that good man, Mr. de Gourville, of whom Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; &s;aid, that the love of his neigh|bour cut off half his words; nor was I unde&s;erving of the character given me by Sainte-Lette, who &s;aid, that though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wit to point an epigram, I never &s;uffered one to e&s;cape my lips.</P>
<P>SINCE the energy of my character has been un|folded by circum&s;tances, by political and other &s;torms, my frankne&s;s takes place of every thing, without con&s;i|dering too nicely the little &s;cratches it may give in its way. Still, however, I deal not in epigrams; they in|dicate a mind plea&s;ed at irritating others by &s;atirical ob|&s;ervations; and, as to me, I never yet could find a|mu&s;ement in killing flies. But I love to do ju&s;tice by the utterance of truths, and refrain not from the mo&s;t &s;evere, in pre&s;ence of the parties concerned, with|out &s;uffering my&s;elf to be alarmed, or moved, or angry, whatever may be the effects they pro|duce.</P>
<P>GATIEN PHLIPON, my father, was by profe&s;&s;ion an engraver; he al&s;o profe&s;&s;ed painting, and applied
<PB N="7" REF="034483_0369_0FFDEBF9D6621E28">
him&s;elf to that in enamel, le&s;s from ta&s;te than ex|pectation of profit: but the fire which enamelling requires, agreeing neither with his &s;ight nor his con&s;titu|tion, he was obliged to relinqui&s;h that branch of the art. He confined him&s;elf therefore to the fir&s;t, the profits of which were moderate. But, though he was indu&s;trious, though the times were favourable to the exerci&s;e of his art, though he had much bu&s;ine&s;s, and though he em|ployed a con&s;iderable number of workmen, the de&s;ire of making a fortune induced him to enter into trade. He purcha&s;ed diamonds, and other jewels, or took them in payment from the trade&s;men who employed him, to &s;ell them again when opportunities might occur. I mention this circum&s;tance, becau&s;e I have ob&s;erved, that ambition is generally fatal to all cla&s;&s;es of men; for the few, who&s;e wi&s;hes it crowns with &s;ucce&s;s, multitudes become its vic|tims. The example of my father will afford me more than one application of this maxim. His art was &s;uffici|ent to procure him a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; he went in pur&s;uit of riches, and met with ruin on his way.</P>
<P>STRONG and healthy, active and vain, he loved his wife, and was fond of dre&s;s. Without learning, he had that &s;uperficial degree of ta&s;te, and knowledge which the fine arts never fail to give, however inferior the line in which they are pur&s;ued. Accordingly, in &s;pite of his regard for wealth, and whatever could procure it, though he trafficked with trade&s;men, he formed con|nexions with arti&s;ts, painters, and &s;culptors alone. He led a very regular life while his ambition was kept within

bounds, and had &s;uffered no rever&s;e of fortune. He could not be &s;aid to be a virtuous man, but he had a great deal of what is called honour. He would have had no objection to &s;elling a thing for more than it was worth, but he would have killed him&s;elf rather than not pay the &s;tipulated price of what he had agreed to purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>MARGARET Bimont, his wife, brought him, as a dower, very little money, but a heavenly mind, and a charming figure. The elde&s;t of &s;ix children, to whom &s;he had been a &s;econd mother, &s;he married at &s;ix-and-twenty, only to re&s;ign her place to her &s;i&s;ters. Her af|fectionate heart and captivating mind ought to have pro|cured her an union with a man of delicate feelings and an enlightened under&s;tanding; but her parents propo&s;ed to her an hone&s;t man, who&s;e talents in&s;ured her a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, and her rea&s;on accepted him. In&s;tead of that happine&s;s, which &s;he could not expect, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that &s;he &s;hould be able to attain dome&s;tic quiet, its mo&s;t de&s;irable &s;ub&s;titute. It is a proof of wi&s;dom to be able to contract our de&s;ires: enjoyments are always more rare than is imagined; but virtue is never without its con&s;olation.</P>
<P>I was their &s;econd child. My father and mother had &s;even? but all the re&s;t died at nur&s;e, or from accidents in coming into the world; and my mother &s;ometimes took a plea&s;ure in remarking, that I was the only one from whom &s;he had experienced no di&s;a&s;ter; for her delivery had been as happy as her pregnancy: it &s;eemed as if I had contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h her health.</P>

<P>THE di&s;cretion, and other excellent qualities, of my mother, &s;oon gave her an a&s;cendancy over my mild and affectionate di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;he never employed but for my good.

and naturally of a reflective turn of mind, I de&s;ired nothing more than to be employed, and readily laid hold of every idea that was held out to me. This di&s;po&s;ition was turned to &s;o good account, that I never remember having been taught to read. I have been told, that at four years old the bu&s;ine&s;s was in a manner completed, and that the trouble of teaching me was over at that epoch, &s;ince all that was in future nece&s;&s;ary, was not to let me want a &s;upply of books. Whatever they were that were put into my hands, or that I could any where meet with, they were &s;ure to engro&s;s all my atten|tion, which could no longer be called away by any thing but a no&s;egay. The &s;ight of a flower delights my imagination, and flatters my &s;en&s;es to an inex|pre&s;&s;ible degree; it awakens me to a luxu|rious conciou&s;ne&s;s of my exi&s;tence.

<P>IT was too good an opportunity of making me acquainted with the Old and New Te&s;taments, and with the Catechi&s;m, both great and &s;mall, to be neglected. I learned every thing it was thought proper to give me, and &s;hould have repeated the Koran had I been taught to read it. I remember

a painter of the name of Guibol, who afterwards &s;ettled at Studgard, and who&s;e panegyric on Pou&s;&s;in, which obtained the prize from the aca|demy of Rouen, fell into my hands a few years ago. He u&s;ed to come frequently to my father's, and was a merry fellow, who told me many ex|travagant tales, which I have not forgotten, and by which I was exceedingly amu&s;ed; nor was he le&s;s diverted with making me di&s;play my &s;lender &s;tock of knowledge in my turn.

They were made to repeat by heart the epi&s;tle and go&s;pel for the day, the collect, and &s;uch a portion of the catechi&s;m as was appointed for their weekly ta&s;k. When the children were numerous, the catechi&s;ing prie&s;t had a little clerk, who heard them repeat their le&s;&s;ons, while the ma&s;ter took upon him&s;elf to explain the que&s;tions e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ubject. In &s;ome pari&s;hes the children of both &s;exes attended together, and were only placed on &s;eparate forms; but in general their hours of in|&s;truction were entirely di&s;tinct. The pious ma|trons to whom the children belonged, always greedy of the bread of the word, however coar&s;ely prepared, were pre&s;ent at the&s;e lectures, &s;eated according to their ages, as well as at the preparation for being confirmed, and receiving the fir&s;t commu|nion. The zealous pa&s;tors al&s;o occa&s;ionally made their appearance amid&s;t their young flock, who were taught to ri&s;e re&s;pectfully at their approach.

From the ironical tone and air of triumph with which he put the que&s;tion, I was per&s;uaded that he expected to puzzle me. I an&s;wered, with a &s;mile, that, though many were enumerated in the preface to the Mi&s;&s;al, I had found from other books that there were nine; and &s;o I mar&s;halled before him in their proper order, the whole ho&s;t of <HI>angels, arch|angels, thrones, dominions,</HI> &amp;c.

The pre&s;ence of his niece was an admirable ex|ample, calculated to induce tho&s;e who were not of what is called the lower order of the people, to &s;end their children al&s;o: a circum&s;tance that could not fail to be plea&s;ing to the rector.&mdash;Be&s;ides, I had a memory which was &s;ure to &s;ecure me the fir&s;t rank; and every thing el&s;e about me &s;upport|ing this kind of &s;uperiority, my parents gratified their vanity, while appearing only to pur&s;ue the path of humility. It happened, that, in the di&s;tribution of prizes, which took place, with no &s;mall parade, at the end of the year, I obtained the fir&s;t, without the lea&s;t partiality being &s;hown me: on this, all the grave churchwardens, and all the reverend clergy of the pari&s;h, congratulated my uncle; who, in con&s;equence of my &s;ucce&s;s, began to be more noticed, which was all that was nece&s;&s;ary to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s every one in his favour.

it; for it was a fea&s;t to me to find a new &s;ubject of &s;tudy. I had at home ma&s;ters for writing, geo|graphy, dancing, and mu&s;ic; and my father had made me begin drawing; but in all this I was far from finding an exce&s;s of occupation.

My ma&s;ters became in con&s;equence more affectionate; gave me long le&s;|&s;ons; and took &s;uch an intere&s;t in my in&s;truction, as called forth on my part additional attention. I had not a &s;ingle ma&s;ter who did not appear as much flattered by teaching me, as I was grateful for being taught; nor one who, after attending me for a year or two, was not the fir&s;t to &s;ay, that his in&s;tructions were no longer nece&s;&s;ary, and that he ought no longer to be paid; but that he &s;hould be glad of permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it my parents in order to conver&s;e with me now and then.

<P>I WAS extremely ob&s;tinate; that is to &s;ay, I did not readily con&s;ent to any thing of which I &s;aw not the rea&s;on; and when the exerci&s;e of authority alone ap|peared, or I fancied that I perceived the dictates of caprice, I could not &s;ubmit. My mother &s;agacious and di&s;creet, rightly judged that I mu&s;t be governed by rea&s;on, or drawn by the cords of affection; and, treating me accordingly, experienced no oppo&s;ition to her will. My father, ha&s;ty in his manner, i&s;&s;ued his orders imperiou&s;ly, and my compliance was either re|luctant, or wholly withheld. If, de&s;pot-like he at|tempted to puni&s;h me, his gentle little daughter was converted into a lion.

I wept both for her &s;ufferings and my own, and be|came &s;till le&s;s capable of complying with her will. My father came, put him&s;elf into a pa&s;&s;ion, and, a&s;cribing my re&s;i&s;tance to &s;tubbornne&s;s, recurred to the remedy of the rod. From that in&s;tant all de&s;ire of obedience vani&s;hed, and I declared that I would not take the medicine at all. A violent uproar, re|peated threats, and a &s;econd whipping, followed. I was only the more indignant, uttering terrible cries, lifting up my eyes to heaven, and preparing to throw away the draught which they were about to pre&s;ent to me again. My ge&s;tures betrayed me; and my father, in a rage, threatened to whip me a third time. I feel, while I write this, the revolution, and developement of fortitude, which took place in my mind. My tears cea&s;ed at once to flow, my &s;obbings were at an end, and a &s;udden calm concentrated my faculties into a &s;ingle re&s;olution. I rai&s;ed my&s;elf, turned to the bed-&s;ide, leaned my head again&s;t the wall, lifted up my chemi&s;e, and expo&s;ed my&s;elf to the rod in &s;ilence. My father might have killed me on the &s;pot, without drawing from me a &s;ingle &s;igh.</P>
<P>MY mother, who was dreadfully agitated by the &s;cene, and who &s;tood in need of all her prudence not to increa&s;e my father's rage, at la&s;t got him out of the room: &s;he then put me to bed without &s;aying a word; and, when I had re&s;ted two hours, returned, and conjured me, with tears in her eyes, to give her no farther vexation, but to take the medicine.

I looked &s;tedfa&s;tly in her face, took the gla&s;s, and &s;wallowed it at a draught.

<P>FROM that in&s;tant my father never laid his hand upon me, nor did he even undertake to reprimand me; but on the contrary, care&s;&s;ed me frequently, taught me to draw, took me out to walk, and treated me with a kindne&s;s that rendered him more re&s;pectable in my eyes, and in&s;ured him my entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The &s;eventh anniver&s;ary of my birth was celebrated as the attainment of the age of rea&s;on, when it might be expected of me to follow its dictates. This was a politic &s;ort of plea for ob&s;erving towards me a more re&s;pectful treatment, that &s;hould give me confidence in my&s;elf, without ex|citing my vanity. My days flowed gently on in do|me&s;tic
<PB N="23" REF="034483_0385_0FFDEC285A027668">
quiet and in great activity of mind. My mother was almo&s;t always at home, and received little company. Two days in the week however we went abroad; once to vi&s;it my father's relations, and once, which was on Sunday, to &s;ee my grandmother Bimont, to go to church, and to take a walk. The vi&s;it to my grandmother always took place as &s;oon as ve&s;pers were over. She was a corpulent but hand|&s;ome woman, who at an early age had &s;uffered an attack of the pal&s;y, from which her under&s;tanding had &s;u&s;tained a permanent injury. From that time &s;he had gradually declined into a &s;tate of dotage, &s;pending her days in her ea&s;y chair, either at the win|dow or the fire&s;ide, according to the &s;ea&s;on. An old &s;ervant, who had been forty years in the family, had the care of her. The &s;ervant, who&s;e name was Mary, regularly upon my entrance, gave me my af|ternoon's repa&s;t. So far all went well; but when that was over, I grew dreadfully tired of the vi&s;it. I fought for books; could find none but the P&s;al|ter; and, for want of better, have twenty times read over the French, and chanted the Latin. When I was gay, my grandmother would weep; if I fell down, or got a blow, &s;he would bur&s;t into a &s;it of laughter. That did not plea&s;e me. It was in vain to tell me it was the effect of her di&s;ea&s;e; I did not find it on that account the le&s;s di&s;agreeable. I could have borne with her laughing at me, but &s;he never &s;hed tears without their being accompanied by cries
<PB N="24" REF="034483_0386_0FFDEC2B089E9E88">
at once grievous and imbecile, which rent my heart, and in&s;pired me with terror. In the mean time old Mary indulged her&s;elf to her heart's content in the garrulity of age, with my mother, who con&s;idered it as a &s;acred duty to pa&s;s two hours with hers, while complai&s;antly li&s;tening to the &s;ervant's tales. This was no doubt a painful exerci&s;e of my patience; but I was forced to &s;ubmit; for one day, when I cried for vexation, and begged to go away, my mother as a puni&s;hment, &s;taid the whole evening. Nor did &s;he fail, at proper times, to repre&s;ent her a&s;&s;iduity as a &s;trict and becoming duty, in which it was honoura|ble for me to participate. I know not how &s;he mana|ged it, but my heart received the le&s;&s;on with emotion. When the Abb&eacute; Bimont could meet us at his mo|ther's, my joy was inexpre&s;&s;ible. That dear little uncle made me dance, and &s;ing, and play; but un|fortunately it was &s;eldom in his power, as he was ma&s;|ter of the chori&s;ters, and much confined to the hou&s;e. This brings to my mind one of his pupils, a lad of a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing countenance, whom he was fond of prai&s;ing, becau&s;e he was the &s;cholar that gave him the lea&s;t trouble. His promi&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition ob|tained him, a few years after, an exhibition at &s;ome college, and he is now no other than the Abb&eacute; <HI>Noel,</HI> known at fir&s;t by &s;ome little productions, employed afterwards by the mini&s;ter Le Brun in the diplomatic line, envoy la&s;t year at London, and now in Italy.</P>
<P>MY &s;tudies completely occupied my days, which
<PB N="25" REF="034483_0387_0FFDEC2ED97C2B80">
&s;eemed very &s;hort; for I had never time to get through all that I was inclined to undertake. Together with the elementary books, with which care had been taken to &s;upply me, I &s;oon exhau&s;ted all tho&s;e that the little family library contained. I devoured every volume, and began the &s;ame over again, when no new ones were to be got. I remember two folio lives of the &s;aints, a bible of the &s;ame &s;ize in an old ver&s;ion, a tran&s;lation of Appian's civil wars, and a de&s;cription of Turkey written in a wretched &s;tyle, all of which I read over and over again. I al&s;o found the Comical Romance of Scar|ron, &s;ome collections of pretended bon mots, on which I did not be&s;tow a &s;econd peru&s;al; the memoirs of the brave De Pontis, which diverted me much; tho&s;e of Mademoi&s;elle de Montpen&s;ier, who&s;e pride did not di&s;plea&s;e me; and &s;everal other antiquated works; the contents, binding, and &s;pots of which I have &s;till before my eyes. The pa&s;&s;ion for learning po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me indeed to &s;uch a degree, that, having picked up a treati&s;e on the art of heraldry, I &s;et my|&s;elf in&s;tantly to &s;tudy it. It had coloured plates, with which I was diverted, and I was glad to know the names of all the little figures they contained. My father was a&s;toni&s;hed when, &s;oon after, I gave him a &s;pecimen of my &s;cience, by making &s;ome remarks on a &s;eal that was not engraved agreeably to the rules of art. On this &s;ubject I became his oracle, nor did I ever mi&s;lead him. A &s;hort treati&s;e on contracts fell
<PB N="26" REF="034483_0388_0FFDEC3064FE7198">
into my hands; and this al&s;o I endeavoured to learn; for I read nothing which I was not de&s;irous of retain|ing: but it tired me &s;o &s;oon, that I did not get to the fourth chapter.</P>
<P>THE Bible had peculiar attraction for me; and I returned frequently to its peru&s;al. In the old tran&s;la|tions it &s;peaks as plain a language as that of the &s;ons of E&s;culapius; and certain crude and &s;imple expre&s;|&s;ions &s;truck me &s;o forcibly, that they have never &s;ince e&s;caped my memory. Hence I derived information not u&s;ually given to girls of my age; but I &s;aw it in a light that was far from &s;educing. I had too much employment for my thoughts to dwell upon things of a mere material nature, that &s;eemed to me to have nothing attractive about them. I could not however help laughing, when my grandmama talked to me of little children dug out of the par&s;ley-bed; and I u&s;ed to &s;ay, that my Ave-Maria informed me they came from another place, without troubling my head how they got there.</P>
<P>IN rummaging the hou&s;e I found a &s;ource of read|ing which I hu&s;banded for a con&s;iderable time. What my father called his work-&s;hop was adjoining to the apartment where I u&s;ually &s;at, which was a hand&s;ome room, that might not improperly have been &s;tyled a drawing-room, but which my mother mode&s;tly called a parlour, neatly furni&s;hed, and or|namented with looking-gla&s;&s;es and a few pictures. It was here I received my le&s;&s;ons. The rece&s;s on one
<PB N="27" REF="034483_0389_0FFDEC3316161550">
&s;ide of the fire-place was converted into a light clo&s;et, in which was placed a bed, &s;o confined for want of room that I was obliged to get into it at the foot; a chair, a &s;mall table, and a few &s;helves. That was my &s;anctuary. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide was a large room, &s;erving as a work-&s;hop, my father having placed in it his bench, various pieces of &s;culpture, and the differ|ent in&s;truments of his art. Thither I u&s;ed to &s;teal in an evening, or at hours of the day when all were ab|&s;ent. I had there remarked a rece&s;s where one of the young men kept his books; a volume of which I carried off at a time, and ha&s;tened to my little clo&s;et to devour it, taking great care to put it in its place again, without &s;aying a word of the matter to any one. They were in general very good books. One day I perceived that my mother had made the &s;ame di&s;co|very as my&s;elf. Recogni&s;ing a volume in her hands which had previou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed through mine, I no longer felt my&s;elf under any re&s;traint; and without telling a fal&s;ehood, but at the &s;ame time without &s;aying a word concerning what had pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;eemed to be only following her example. The young man, who&s;e name was Cour&s;on, to which he afterwards prefixed the <HI>de</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De</HI> before a name in France was generally the &s;ymbol of a noble family.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, when he contrived to get into place at Ver|&s;ailles as teacher to the pages, did not at all re&s;emble his comrades: he was not de&s;titute of politene&s;s, was decent in his demeanour, and fond of &s;tudy. He
<PB N="28" REF="034483_0390_0FFDEC35C837BE98">
&s;aid nothing of the occa&s;ional di&s;appearance of his books; &s;o that it &s;eemed as if there were a tacit agree|ment between all the parties. In this way I read a great many volumes of travels, of which I was pa&s;|&s;ionately fond; among others, tho&s;e of Renard, which were the fir&s;t; &s;ome plays of &s;econd-rate au|thors, and Dacier's Plutarch. This la&s;t work was mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to my ta&s;te than any thing I had yet &s;een, not excepting even pathetic &s;tories, which however af|fected me much; as for in&s;tance, that of the unfor|tunate couple, by Labedoy&egrave;re, which is &s;till pre&s;ent to my mind, although I have never read it &s;ince that early period. But Plutarch &s;eemed to be exactly the intellectual food that &s;uited me. I &s;hall never forget the Lent of 1763, at which time I was nine years of age, when I carried it to church in&s;tead of the Exer|ci&s;es of the Holy Week. It is from that period that I may date the impre&s;&s;ions and ideas which render|ed me a republican, without my dreaming of ever be|coming one.</P>
<P>TELEMACHUS, and Jeru&s;alem Delivered, interfered a little with the current of the&s;e maje&s;tic thoughts. The tender Fenelon moved my heart, and Ta&s;&s;o fired my imagination. Sometimes I read aloud at my mother's reque&s;t, of which I was by no means fond, as it diverted me from that clo&s;e attention which con&s;tituted my delight, and obliged me to proceed with le&s;s rapidity. But I would have plucked out my tongue rather than have read in that manner
<PB N="29" REF="034483_0391_0FFDEC3876C0A1D0">
the epi&s;odes of the i&s;land of Calyp&s;o, and a number of pa&s;&s;ages in Ta&s;&s;o. My re&s;piration quickened, a &s;udden glow over&s;pread my countenance, and an agitation followed, which my faultering voice would have betrayed. With Telemachus I was Eucharis, and Herminia with Tancred. Completely transfor|med into the&s;e heroines, I thought not as yet of being &s;omething my&s;elf with &s;ome other per&s;onage. None of my reflections came home to me. I look around me for nothing. I was the very characters them|&s;elves, and &s;aw only the objects which exi&s;ted on their account. It was a kind of waking dream, that led to nothing more &s;ub&s;tantial. I recollect however having &s;een with con&s;iderable emotion a young painter of the name of <HI>Taboral,</HI> who came occa&s;ionally to my father's hou&s;e. He was about twenty, his voice was &s;oft, his features langui&s;hing, and he blu&s;hed like a girl. When I heard him in the work-&s;hop, I had always a crayon or &s;omething el&s;e to &s;eek; but as the &s;ight of him embarra&s;&s;ed no le&s;s than it plea&s;ed me, I ran out again more &s;peedily than I entered, with a palpitation of my heart and a trembling of my limbs, that I ha&s;tened to conceal in my little clo&s;et. I can readily believe, that, with &s;uch a di&s;|po&s;ition, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by lei&s;ure and a certain kind of company, both my imagination and my per&s;on might have been greatly affected.</P>
<P>THE works of which I have been &s;peaking gave place to others, which &s;oftened the powerful im|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="30" REF="034483_0392_0FFDEC3B44753C40">
they had produced. Some of the writings of Voltaire &s;erved to operate this diver&s;ion. One day, when I was reading Candide, my mother having de&s;erted her party of piquet, the lady with whom &s;he was playing calling me from the corner in which I was &s;itting, de&s;ired to &s;ee the book I had in my hand; and on my mother's return expre&s;&s;ed her a&s;toni&s;hment at the nature of my &s;tudies.&mdash; My mother, without making any an&s;wer, contented her&s;elf with merely ordering me to carry it back to the place whence it came. I ca&s;t an evil eye upon this woman, of forbidding countenance, mon&s;trous rotundity of wai&s;t, and affected importance; nor from that day forward did I ever be&s;tow a &s;mile upon Madame Charbonn&eacute;. My good mother, how|ever, made no alteration in her truly unaccountable conduct, but permitted me to read all the books I could lay my hands on, without &s;eeming to attend to them, though &s;he knew very well what they were. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve at the &s;ame time, that no immoral publication ever came in my way; and even now I am only acquainted with the titles of two or three; the ta&s;te I have acquired having ever prevented my feeling the &s;malle&s;t temptation to procure them. As I preferred books to every thing el&s;e, my father &s;ometimes made me pre&s;ents of that kind; but, piquing him&s;elf, as he did, on &s;econding my propen|&s;ity to &s;erious &s;tudies, his choice was whim&s;ical: he gave me, for in&s;tance, Fenelon on female

education, and Locke on that of children in general; thus putting into the hands of the pupil what were de&s;igned for the tutor. I am per&s;uaded, however, that the incongruity was not unproductive of benefit, and that chance perhaps &s;erved me better than the u&s;ual con&s;iderations of propriety would have done. I was very forward for my age; I loved to reflect; I thought &s;eriou&s;ly of improving my&s;elf; that is to &s;ay, I &s;tudied the movements of my mind; I &s;ought to know my&s;elf; and I felt that I had a de&s;tination which it was requi&s;ite I &s;hould enable my&s;elf to fill. Religious notions began to ferment in my brain, and &s;oon produced a violent explo&s;ion. But before I de&s;cribe them, it may be proper for my reader to know what became of my Latin.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t rudiments of grammar were well arranged in my head. I declined nouns and conjugated verbs, though it appeared to me tire&s;ome enough; but the hope of being able on &s;ome future day to read in that language the admirable productions of which I heard &s;o much, and of which my books afforded me &s;ome idea, gave me re&s;olution to get through the dry and difficult ta&s;k. It was not thus with my little uncle, for &s;o I called the Abb&eacute; Bimont. Young, good-humour|ed, indolent, and gay, giving not the &s;malle&s;t trouble to anybody, caring little to give him&s;elf any for others, and heartily tired of his trade of pedagogue with the chori&s;ters; he liked better to take a walk with me than to give me a le&s;&s;on, and to make me laugh and

play, than to hear me repeat my rudiments. He was far from being punctual either as to the hour or the day of coming to our hou&s;e, and a thou&s;and circum|&s;tances combined to procra&s;tinate his le&s;&s;ons. I was de&s;irous however of learning, and loath to relin|qui&s;h what I had once begun. It was therefore re|&s;olved upon, that I &s;hould go to him three morn|ings a week; but he was too giddy to keep him|&s;elf at liberty to devote a few moments to my in&s;truction. I was &s;ure to find him either bu&s;ied in pari&s;h affairs, diverting him&s;elf with his boys, or breakfa&s;ting with a friend. I lo&s;t my time, the winter &s;ea&s;on came on, and my Latin was aban|doned. From that attempt I have pre&s;erved only a &s;ort of glimmering or in&s;tinct of knowledge, which, during the days of devotion, enabled me to repeat or chant the P&s;alms without being ab&s;olutely ignorant of what I was &s;aying, and a con&s;iderable facility for the &s;tudy of languages in general, particularly the Italian, which I learnt a few years after, without a ma&s;ter, and without difficulty.</P>
<P>MY father took but little pains to forward me in drawing: he rather amu&s;ed him&s;elf with my apti|tude, than endeavoured to give me extraordinary talents. A few words that dropped in a conver&s;a|tion with my mother, gave me to under&s;tand that, from prudential motives, &s;he was not de&s;irous of my making any great proficiency in the art. "I would not have her become a painter,' &s;aid &s;he; 'it

would require an intercommunity of &s;tudies, and connections that we can very well di&s;pen&s;e with.' I was al&s;o &s;et to engrave; learnt to hold the graver, and got over the fir&s;t difficulties in a &s;hort time; for nothing came ami&s;s to me. On the birth-days of my good old relations, which were always religiou&s;ly ce|lebrated, I carried for my pre&s;ent, either a pretty head, which I had been at great pains to draw for the occa&s;ion, or a neat little copper-plate, on which I had engraved a flower, with a compliment beneath, written with great care, and in ver&s;es hammered out by <HI>Mr. De|mure.</HI> In return I received almanacs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">French almanacs are very different from the Engli&s;h: mo&s;t of them are without calendars, &s;uch as l'Almanach Chantant, con|&s;i&s;ting entirely of &s;ongs, l'Almanach des Mu&s;es, containing a mix|ture of fugitive pieces in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, which greatly amu&s;ed me, and pre&s;ents of &s;uch little articles as were adapted to my u&s;e, in general ornaments of dre&s;s, of which I was very fond. My mother took a plea&s;ure in &s;eeing me fine. In her own dre&s;s &s;he was plain, and frequently even negligent; but her daughter was her doll, and from my early infancy I was dre&s;&s;ed with a degree of elegance, and even richne&s;s, that &s;eemed un&s;uitable to my condition. Young ladies at that time wore what was called a <HI>corps-de-robe,</HI> a dre&s;s re&s;embling court robes, and fit|ting very clo&s;ely at the wai&s;t, of which it di&s;played the form to advantage, but full below, with a long train that &s;wept the ground, adorned with different trim|mings,
<PB N="34" REF="034483_0396_0FFDEC4738834900">
according to the ta&s;te of the wearer. Mine were of fine &s;ilk, of &s;om&eacute; &s;imple pattern and mode&s;t colour, but in price and quality equal to my mother's be&s;t gala &s;uits. My toilet was a grievous bu&s;ine&s;s to me, for my hair was frequently frizzed, papered, and tortured with hot irons, and all the other ridiculous and barbarous implements at that time in u&s;e. My head was &s;o extremely tender, and the pulling I was obliged to undergo &s;o painful, that, upon occa&s;ions of full dre&s;s, my &s;ufferings always forced tears from my eyes, although I uttered no complaint.</P>
<P>METHINKS I hear it a&s;ked, For who&s;e eyes, in the retired life I led, was all this finery intended? They who a&s;k the que&s;tion ought to recollect, that I went out two days in the week; and if they were acquaint|ed with the manners of what was at that time called the <HI>bourgeoi&s;ie</HI> of Paris, they mu&s;t know there were thou&s;ands of them who&s;e expence in dre&s;s, by no means &s;mall, had no other object, than an exhibition of a few hours on Sunday in the <HI>Tuileries</HI>; to which their wives joined the di&s;play of their finery at church, and the plea&s;ure of parading their own quarter of the town, before their admiring neighbours. Add to this, family vi&s;its on great fe&s;tivals, new year's day, weddings and chri&s;tenings, and there will be found &s;ufficient opportunities for the gratification of vanity. By the way, more than one contra&s;t may be ob&s;erved in my education. The young lady, exhibited on Sun|days at church, and the public walks, in an elegant

It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, I was not much plea&s;ed with it; but I &s;howed no &s;igns of di&s;like, and acquitted my&s;elf of my commi&s;&s;ion in &s;uch a way as to render it agreeable. I behaved with &s;o much civility, and at the &s;ame time with &s;o much dignity, that the fruiterer, or other &s;hopkeeper, took a plea|&s;ure in &s;erving me fir&s;t; and yet tho&s;e who came be|fore me were never offended: I was &s;ure to pick up &s;ome compliment or other in the way, which only &s;erved to make me more polite. The &s;ame child, who read &s;y&s;tematic works, who could explain the circles of the cele&s;tial &s;phere, handle the crayon and the graver, and who, at eight years of age, was the be&s;t dancer in the youthful parties that met occa&s;ion|ally to a&s;&s;i&s;t at &s;ome little family fe&s;tival, was fre|quently called into the kitchen to make an omelet, pick herbs, or &s;kim the pot. That mixture of &s;erious &s;tudies, agreeable relaxations, and dome&s;tic cares, properly ordered, and rendered agreeable by my mo|ther's good management, made me fit for every thing, &s;eemed to forebode the vici&s;&s;itudes of my fortune, and enabled me to &s;upport them.

<P>IT may be &s;uppo&s;ed, from what I have already re|lated, that my mother did not neglect what is called religion. She was pious without being a bigot; &s;he had faith, or endeavoured to have faith; and con|formed her conduct to the rules of the church with the humility and regularity of a per&s;on who, finding it nece&s;&s;ary for her peace of mind to adopt great prin|ciples, does not he&s;itate at trifling details. The re&s;|pectful air with which the fir&s;t notions of religion had been pre&s;ented to me, had di&s;po&s;ed me to re|ceive them with attention. They were of a nature calculated to make con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion on a live|ly imagination; and notwith&s;tanding the trouble|&s;ome doubts frequently excited by my infant rea&s;on, which regarded with &s;urpri&s;e the transformation of the devil into a &s;erpent, and thought it cruel in God to have permitted it, I at la&s;t believed and adored.</P>
<P>I HAD received confirmation with the deep atten|tion of a mind that calculates the importance of its actions, and meditates on its duties. The pre|paring me for my fir&s;t communion was talked of, and I felt a &s;acred terror take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul.</P>

It began with the love of God, the &s;ublime raptures of which rendered the fir&s;t years of my adole&s;cence &s;afe and happy, re&s;igned the re&s;t to the care of philo&s;ophy, and &s;eemed likely to protect me for ever from the &s;torm of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, from which, with a con&s;titution as vigorous as that of a prize-fighter, it is with difficulty that I pre&s;erve my riper age.</P>
<P>THE fit of devotion which agitated me, pro|duced an a&s;toni&s;hing alteration in my mind. I be|came profoundly humble and inexpre&s;&s;ibly timid. I looked upon men with a &s;ort of terror, which in|crea&s;ed when any of them &s;truck me as amiable. I watched over my thoughts with extreme &s;crupulo&s;ity; the lea&s;t profane image that offered it&s;elf to my mind, however confu&s;edly, &s;eemed a crime. I contracted &s;uch a habit of re&s;erve, that, peru&s;ing Buffon's Natural Hi&s;tory at the age of &s;ixteen, when no longer a devotee, I &s;kipped the article Man, and turned over the plates relating to it, with the &s;peed and terror of a per&s;on who &s;ees a precipice beneath his feet. In &s;hort, I did not marry till I was twenty-five; and with a heart &s;uch as may be imagined, &s;en&s;es highly inflammable, and con&s;iderable infor|mation as to &s;everal points, I had &s;o well avoided all knowledge concerning one circum&s;tance, that the
<PB N="38" REF="034483_0400_0FFDEC50D4381A08">
con&s;equences of marriage were as &s;urpri&s;ing to me as they were unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>MY life, which every day grew more and more retired, appeared &s;till too worldly to admit of my preparing for my fir&s;t communion. That import|ant tran&s;action, which was to have &s;uch influence on my eternal &s;alvation, occupied all my thoughts. I acquired a ta&s;te for divine &s;ervice; I was &s;truck with its &s;olemnity; I read with avidity the explana|tion of the church ceremonies, and trea&s;ured up their my&s;tic &s;ignification in my mind. Every day I turned over my folio Lives of the Saints, and re|gretted tho&s;e happy days when the per&s;ecuting fury of pagani&s;m conferred the crown of martyrdom upon courageous chri&s;tians. I began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of embracing a new kind of life, and, after pro|found meditations, fixed upon my plan. Until then, the idea of parting from my mother, u&s;ed to draw a flood of tears from my eyes; and whenever any of my friends wi&s;hed to divert them&s;elves with the &s;udden clouds that &s;en&s;ibility &s;pread over my ex|pre&s;&s;ive brow, they never failed to talk of convents, and of the propriety of &s;ending young women to in|habit them for a &s;hort &s;pace of time. But what ought we not to &s;acrifice to the Lord? I had formed of the &s;olitude and &s;ilence of a cloi&s;ter, tho&s;e grand or romantic ideas which an active imagination would naturally engender. The more &s;olemn its abode, the better it &s;uited the enthu&s;ia&s;tic di&s;po&s;ition of my
<PB N="39" REF="034483_0401_0FFDEC5261BDE0E0">
mind. One evening, after &s;upper, being alone with my parents, I fell at their feet, &s;hedding at the &s;ame time a torrent of tears, which deprived me of utterance. A&s;toni&s;hed and unea&s;y, they a&s;ked the meaning of this &s;trange emotion. 'I beg of you,' &s;aid I, &s;obbing, 'to do a thing which is mo&s;t pain|ful to my heart, but which is called for by my con|&s;cience. Send me to a convent.' They rai&s;ed me from the ground. My excellent mother was affected, and no doubt would have been alarmed, if my hav|ing been con&s;tantly in her pre&s;ence for &s;ome time before, had not removed all grounds of fear: &s;he a&s;ked me what it was that made me de&s;irous of leav|ing them, ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, I had never been refu&s;ed any rea&s;onable reque&s;t. I an&s;wered, it was my wi&s;h to receive the communion for the fir&s;t time in a di&s;po&s;ition of mind &s;uitable to the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion. My father commended my zeal, and expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to comply with my de&s;ire. The next difficulty was, the making a choice among the different religious hou&s;es, in none of which my parents had any connexions; but they recollected that my mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter had &s;poken of a con|vent in which he gave le&s;&s;ons to &s;everal young ladies and re&s;olved to make inquiry concerning it. They found it to be a re&s;pectable hou&s;e, and of an order not very &s;trict. The nuns had con&s;equently the repu|tation of not practi&s;ing tho&s;e extravagancies and mummeries for which nuns are generally remarka|ble;
<PB N="40" REF="034483_0402_0FFDEC5654F7B4D0">
the education of youth was al&s;o their profe&s;&s;ion. They kept a day-&s;chool for children of the lower cla&s;s, whom they taught <HI>gratis,</HI> in conformity with their vows, and who came from their own homes to a room &s;et apart for them; the boarding-&s;chool for &s;uch young women as were confided to their care, being entirely detached.</P>
<P>MY mother took the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps; and after car|rying me to vi&s;it all my relations of the &s;uperior de|gree, and informing them of my re&s;olution, which was highly commended, conducted me to the &s;i&s;ter|hood of the Congregation, in the Rue Neuve St. Etienne, Fauxbourg St. Marceau, very near the pri|&s;on in which I am now confined. While pre&s;&s;ing my dear mother in my arms at the moment of parting with her for the fir&s;t time in my life, I thought my heart would have bur&s;t; but I was acting in obedi|ence to the voice of God, and pa&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold of the cloi&s;ter, offering up to him with tears, the great|e&s;t &s;acrifice I was capable of making. That was the &s;eventh of May, 1765, when I was <HI>eleven years</HI> and two months old.</P>
<P>IN the gloom of a pri&s;on, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e po|litical commotions which ravage my country, and &s;weep away all that is dear to me, how &s;hall I re|call to my mind, and how de&s;cribe, that period of rapture and tranquility? What lively colours can ex|pre&s;s the &s;oft emotions of a young heart endued with tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility, greedy of happine&s;s, be|ginning
<PB N="41" REF="034483_0403_0FFDEC59045A5970">
to be alive to the feelings of nature, and per|ceiving the Deity alone? The fir&s;t night that I &s;pent at the convent was a night of agitation. I was no longer under the paternal roof. I was at a di&s;tance from that kind mother, who was doubtle&s;s thinking of me with affectionate emotion. A dim light diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through the room in which I had been put to bed, with four children of my own age. I &s;tole &s;oftly from my couch, and drew near the window, the light of the moon enabling me to di&s;tingui&s;h the garden, which it overlooked. The deepe&s;t &s;ilence prevailed around, and I li&s;tened to it, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;|&s;ion, with a &s;ort of re&s;pect. Lofty trees ca&s;t their gigantic &s;hadows along the ground, and promi&s;ed a &s;ecure a&s;ylum to peaceful meditation. I lifted up my eyes to the heavens; they were unclouded and &s;erene. I imagined that I felt the pre&s;ence of the Deity &s;mil|ing on my &s;acrifice, and already offering me a reward in the con&s;olatory peace of a cele&s;tial abode. Tears of delight flowed gently down my cheeks. I repeated my vows with holy ec&s;tacy, and went to bed again to ta&s;te the &s;lumber of the elect.</P>
<P>AS it was evening when I came to the convent, I had not yet &s;een all my fellow-boarders. They were thirty-four in number, and were a&s;&s;embled in one &s;chool-room, from the age of &s;ix to that of &s;eventeen or eighteen, but were divided into two tables at meals, and as it were into two &s;ections in the cour&s;e of the day, to perform their exerci&s;es. There was &s;o much
<PB N="42" REF="034483_0404_0FFDEC5CCEDA3348">
of the little woman about me, that it was immediately judged proper to include me in the elder &s;et. I ac|cordingly became the twelfth at their table, and found my&s;elf the younge&s;t of them all. The tone of politene&s;s which my mother had rendered familiar, the &s;edate air which was become habitual to me, and my courteous and correct mode of &s;peaking, in no way re&s;embled the noi&s;y and thoughtle&s;s mirth of my volatile companions. The children addre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves to me with a &s;ort of confidence, becau&s;e I never gave them a rough an&s;wer; and the elder girls treated me with a kind of re&s;pect, becau&s;e my re&s;erve did not render me the le&s;s obliging to them, while it pro|cured particular attention from the nuns. Brought up as I had hitherto been, it was not &s;urpri&s;ing I &s;hould be found better informed than mo&s;t of my cla&s;s, even than tho&s;e who&s;e age the mo&s;t exceeded mine. The nuns perceived they might derive honour from my education, merely from my being under their care, without being obliged to take any pains to continue it. I know already, or very ea&s;ily learnt every thing they gave me to &s;tudy; and became the favourite of the whole &s;i&s;terhood: it was quite matter of contention who &s;hould care&s;s and compliment me. She, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to teach the boarders to write, was &s;eventy years of age, and had taken the veil at fifty, either out of chagrin at &s;ome di&s;appointment, or in con&s;equence of &s;ome misfortune. She had
<PB N="43" REF="034483_0405_0FFDEC5E5DAF26D0">
been well educated, and joined to that advantage all that could be derived from good breeding and a know|ledge of the world. She valued her&s;elf on her &s;kill in teaching, &s;till wrote a very fine hand, embroider|ed with elegance, gave excellent le&s;&s;ons of orthogra|phy, and was by no means unacquainted with hi&s;tory. Her diminutive figure, her age it&s;elf, and &s;ome &s;mall tincture of pedantry, occa&s;ioned old &s;i&s;ter St. Sophia to be treated, by her giddy little pupils, with le&s;s re|&s;pect than &s;he de&s;erved; and if I recollect aright, the jealou&s;y of the good nuns, who were fond of expo|&s;ing her defects becau&s;e they did not po&s;&s;e&s;s her talents, tended not a little to encourage their impertinence. This excellent woman &s;oon became much attached to me on account of my &s;tudious turn. After having given a le&s;&s;on to the whole cla&s;s, &s;he would take me a&s;ide, make me repeat my grammar, go over my maps, and extract pa&s;&s;ages from hi&s;tory. She even obtained permi&s;&s;ion to take me to her cell, where I u&s;ed to read to her.</P>
<P>OF my former tutors I had retained only one, and that was my mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, of whom I received le&s;&s;ons in the parlour, with two of my fellow-boarders, under the in&s;pection of a nun: and in order to keep up my drawing, I was intended by a female arti&s;t, who was admitted into the interior of the convent.</P>
<P>THE regularity of a life filled up with &s;uch a variety of &s;tudies, was perfectly &s;uitable to the activity of my mind, as well as to my natural ta&s;te
<PB N="44" REF="034483_0406_0FFDEC6129DDC218">
for method and application. I was one of the fir&s;t at every thing; and &s;till I had lei&s;ure, becau&s;e I was diligent, and did not lo&s;e a moment of my time. In the hours &s;et apart for walking and recreation, I felt no de&s;ire to run and play with the crowd, but retired to &s;ome &s;olitary &s;pot to read and meditate. How delighted was I with the beauty of the foliage, the breath of the zephyrs, and the fragrance of the &s;urrounding flowers! Everywhere I perceived the hand of the Deity; I was &s;en&s;ible of his beneficent care of his creatures; and I admired his wonderful works. Full of gratitude, I went to adore him in the church, where the maje&s;tic &s;ounds of the organ, ac|companied by the captivating voices of the young nuns chanting their anthems, completed my ec&s;tacy. Inde|pendently of ma&s;s, to which all the boarders were regularly conducted in the morning, half an hour in the afternoon of every working day was con&s;e|crated to meditation, to which tho&s;e only were admitted who appeared capable of it, or at lea&s;t of filling up that interval of time by the attentive read|ing of religious works. It was not even nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;olicit this favour, which they were eager to confer upon me as a recompence for my zeal: but I earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to be allowed to receive my fir&s;t communion at the next great fe&s;tival, which happen|ed to be the A&s;&s;umption. Though it followed &s;oon after my entrance into the convent, my reque&s;t was granted with the unanimous con&s;ent of the &s;uperiors,
<PB N="45" REF="034483_0407_0FFDEC64F8463448">
and of the director. The latter was a man of good &s;en&s;e, and a monk of the mona&s;tery of St. Victor, where he officiated as rector. He had undertaken the ta&s;k of confe&s;&s;ing the boarders of the Congregation, and was well fitted for it by his age, which was up|wards of fifty, by the mildne&s;s of his temper, and by his great good &s;en&s;e, which tempered the au&s;terity of his morals and demeanour. At the time I was con|fided to his care, Mr. <HI>Garat,</HI> the prie&s;t of my pari&s;h, had the conde&s;cen&s;ion to come him&s;elf to the convent to depo&s;it his tender lamb in the hands of his &s;piritual brother. They had an interview in the parlour in my pre&s;ence, and conver&s;ed in Latin, which I did not per|fectly under&s;tand, but of which I comprehended a few words very much to my advantage. The&s;e never e&s;cape the penetration of a female, whatever may be her age, or the language in which they are uttered. I gained con&s;iderably by the change. Garat was a mere pedant, in whom I &s;hould have found all the &s;ternne&s;s of a &s;piritual judge: the monk of St. Victor was an upright and enlightened man, who directed my pious affections to all that is great and &s;ublime in morality; and who took a plea&s;ure in developing the germs of virtue, by the in&s;trumen|tality of religion, without any ab&s;urd mixture of its my&s;tici&s;m. I loved him as much as if he had been my father; and during the three years that he &s;urviv|ed, after my quitting the convent, went regularly
<PB N="46" REF="034483_0408_0FFDEC6689CF8150">
from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance to St. Victor's on the eve of great fe&s;tivals, to confe&s;s my&s;elf to him.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied, that the catholic religion, though little &s;uited to a &s;ound judgment and an en|lightened mind, that &s;ubjects its faith to the rules of rea&s;on, is well calculated to captivate the imagination, which it lays hold of by means of the grand and the terrific, while at the &s;ame time it occupies the &s;en&s;es by my&s;terious ceremonies, alternately &s;oothing and melancholy. Eternity, always pre&s;ent to the mind of its &s;ectaries, calls them to contemplation. It ren|ders them &s;crupulous appreciators of good and evil, while its daily practi&s;es and awful rites &s;erve both to keep up the attention, and offer the ea&s;y means of advancing towards the end propo&s;ed. Women are wonderful adepts in giving a grace to tho&s;e prac|tices, and in accompanying rites with whatever can add to their charms and &s;plendour&mdash;an art in which nuns particularly excel. A novice took the veil &s;oon after my arrival at the convent. The church and the altar were decorated with flowers, brilliant lu&s;tres, &s;ilk curtains, and other rich ornaments. The a&s;&s;embly was numerous, and came crowding into the outer part of the church, with that fe&s;tive air, which a family u&s;ually affects on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, as if it were the wedding of one of the children. The young victim appeared at the grate in the mo&s;t &s;plendid dre&s;s, which however &s;he &s;oon pulled off, to appear again covered with a white
<PB N="47" REF="034483_0409_0FFDEC69661DD3E8">
veil, and crowned with ro&s;es. I &s;till feel the agitation which her &s;lightly tremulous voice excited in my bo|&s;om, when &s;he melodiou&s;ly chanted the cu&s;tomary ver&s;e, <HI>Elegit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Here have I cho&s;en my abode, and will e&s;tabli&s;h it for ever.</HI> I have not forgotten the notes of this little pa&s;&s;age; but can repeat them as accurately as if I had heard them only ye&s;terday; and happy &s;hould I be if I could chant them in Ame|rica! Great God! with what empha&s;is &s;hould I utter them now!&mdash;But when the novice, after pronouncing her vows, was covered, as &s;he lay pro&s;trate on the ground, with a pall, under which one might have &s;uppo&s;ed her to be buried, I trembled with horror. To me it repre&s;ented the image of an ab&s;olute di&s;&s;o|lution of every earthly tie, and the renunciation of all that was dear to her. I was no longer my&s;elf: I was the very victim of the &s;acrifice. I thought they were tearing me from my mother, and &s;hed a torrent of tears. With &s;en&s;ibility like this, which renders impre&s;&s;ions &s;o profound, and occa&s;ions &s;o many things to &s;trike us, that pa&s;s away like &s;hadows before the eyes of the vulgar, our exi&s;tence never grows languid. Accordingly, I have reflected on mine from an early period, without having ever found it a burden, even in the mid&s;t of the &s;evere&s;t trials; and though not yet forty, I have lived to a prodigious age, if life be mea&s;ured by the &s;entiment which has marked every moment of its duration.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have too many &s;cenes of a &s;imilar na|ture
<PB N="48" REF="034483_0410_0FFDEC6C14DBB8C0">
to recount, were I to go over all which the emotions of a tender piety have engraven on my heart. The charm and habit of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations made an impre&s;&s;ion upon me which nothing can efface. Philo&s;ophy has di&s;pelled the illu&s;ions of an empty faith, but it has not annihilated the effect of certain objects on my &s;en&s;es, or their a&s;&s;ociation with the ideas and di&s;po&s;ition of mind which they were accu&s;tomed to excite. I can &s;till attend divine &s;ervice with plea&s;ure, if performed with &s;olemnity. I forget the quackery of prie&s;ts, their ridiculous fables and ab&s;urd my&s;teries, and &s;ee nothing but weak mor|tals a&s;&s;embled together to implore the &s;uccour of the Supreme Being. The mi&s;eries of mankind, and the con&s;olatory hope of an omnipotent remune|rator, occupy my thoughts. Every extraneous idea is excluded; the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ide into tranquility, and the &s;en&s;e of my duties is quickened. If mu&s;ic form a part of the ceremony, I find my&s;elf tran&s;ported to another world; and I come out with an amended heart from a place, to which the imbecil and ignorant crowd re&s;ort, without reflection, to adore a mor&s;el of bread. It is with religion as with many other human in&s;titutions: it does not change the di&s;|po&s;ition of an individual, but a&s;&s;imilates it&s;elf to his nature, and they are together exalted or enfeebled. The herd of mankind think but little, take every thing on hear&s;ay, and act from in&s;tinct; &s;o that there prevails a perpetual contradiction between the prin|ciples
<PB N="49" REF="034483_0411_0FFDEC6FDD920D98">
they admit, and the conduct they pur&s;ue. Strong minds proceed upon a different plan; they re|quire con&s;i&s;tency, and their actions are a faithful tran&s;cript of their faith. In my infancy, I nece&s;&s;arily embraced the creed that was offered me: it was mine; until my mind was &s;ufficiently enlightened to examine it; but even then all my actions were in &s;trict confor|mity with it's precepts. I was a&s;toni&s;hed at the levity of tho&s;e, who, profe&s;&s;ing a &s;imilar faith, acted in a contrary way; in like manner as I am now indig|nant at the cowardice of men, who would wi&s;h to &s;ee their country free, and yet &s;et a value upon life when an opportunity offers of ri&s;king it for the public weal.</P>
<P>THOUGH wi&s;hing to avoid repetitions upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, I will neverthele&s;s relate an incident that marks the &s;ituation of my mind at the moment of my fir&s;t communion. Prepared by all the means cu&s;tomary in convents, by retirement, long prayers, &s;ilence, and meditation, I con&s;idered it as a &s;olemn engagement, and the pledge of eternal felicity. This idea engro&s;&s;ed the whole of my attention. It &s;o in|flamed my imagination, and &s;oftened my heart to &s;uch a degree, that, bathed in tears, and enraptured with divine love, I was incapable of walking to the altar without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a nun, who came and took me under both arms, and helped me to advance to the &s;acred table. The&s;e demon&s;trations, which were by no means affected, but the natural con&s;equence of
<PB N="50" REF="034483_0412_0FFDEC716A7CD0D8">
a &s;entiment I could not repre&s;s, obtained me great con&s;ideration, and all the good old women I met upon my way were &s;ure to recommend them&s;elves to my prayers.</P>
<P>METHINKS I hear my reader a&s;k, if this heart &s;o tender, this extreme &s;en&s;ibility, were not at length exerci&s;ed on more &s;ub&s;tantial objects; and whether the&s;e early dreams of bli&s;s were not afterwards reali&s;ed by a pa&s;&s;ion, of which &s;ome happy individual &s;hared the fruits?</P>
<P>TO all this my an&s;wer is, let us not anticipate. Dwell with me a while upon tho&s;e peaceful days of holy delu&s;ion. Think you that, in an age &s;o corrupt, and in a &s;ocial order &s;o perver&s;e, it is po&s;&s;ible to ta&s;te the delights of nature and innocence? Vulgar &s;ouls indeed may find plea&s;ure in &s;uch an age; but as to tho&s;e for whom plea&s;ure alone would be too little, impelled on the one hand by pa&s;&s;ions that promi&s;e them more, and re&s;trained on the other by duties which they are bound to re&s;pect, however ab&s;urd and &s;evere, their enjoyments con&s;i&s;t of little el&s;e but the dear-bought glory of &s;acrificing the feel|ings of nature to the tyrannical in&s;titutions of man|kind. Let us then, for the pre&s;ent, &s;eek repo&s;e of &s;pirit in the pure joys of friend&s;hip, which came to offer me its comforts, and to which I have been in|debted for &s;o many happy days.</P>
<P>SOME months had elap&s;ed &s;ince my arrival at the convent, where I &s;pent my time in the way de&s;cribed

above. Once a week I was vi&s;ited by my parents, who took me out on Sundays, after divine &s;ervice, to walk in the <HI>Jardin du Roi,</HI> now called <HI>le Jar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> des Plantes.</HI> I never quitted them without &s;heddin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ears, which proceeded from affection to their per&s;ons, and not from di&s;like to my &s;ituation; for I returned with plea&s;ure to the &s;ilent cloi&s;ters, and walked through them with mea&s;ured &s;teps, the better to enjoy their &s;olitude. Sometimes I would &s;top at a tomb, on which the eulogy of a pious maiden was engraved. 'She is happy!' &s;aid I to my&s;elf, with a &s;igh; and then a melancholy, which was not without its charms, would take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, and make me long to be received into the bo&s;om of the Deity, where I hoped to find that perfect felicity of which I felt the want.</P>
<P>THE arrival of new boarders was an event which put all our youthful &s;pirits on the wing, the curio&s;ity of girls in a convent being &s;tronger upon &s;uch occa|&s;ions than can well be imagined. Young ladies from Amiens had been announced. It was on a &s;ummer's evening, and we were walking down an avenue of trees, when the exclamation, 'There they are! there they are!' pa&s;&s;ed &s;uddenly from mouth to mouth. The prin|cipal mi&s;tre&s;s committed the &s;trangers to the care of the nun who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s at that time it happened to be to &s;uperintend the boarders. The crowd gathered round them, walked away, returned again, fell at length into regular order, and paraded up and down the

&s;ame walk in parties to examine the Mi&s;s Cannets. They were two &s;i&s;ters. The elde&s;t was about eighteen, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hape, a forward air, and ea&s;y carriage, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">dered remarkable by &s;omething about her which indicated at the &s;ame time &s;en&s;ibility, pride, and di&s;content. The younge&s;t was not more than four|teen: a veil of white gauze covered her charming countenance, and ill concealed the tears in which it was bathed. I felt a liking for her at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;top|ped to get a better view of her per&s;on, and then mixed with the talkers to enquire what they knew of her.</P>
<P>SHE was the favourite, they &s;aid, of her mother, whom &s;he tenderly loved, and with whom &s;he was &s;o loth to part, that her &s;i&s;ter had been &s;ent with her in order to enable her the better to bear the &s;eparation. Both were &s;eated at &s;upper at the &s;ame table with me. Sophia ate but little. Her mute grief was no way repul&s;ive, and could not fail to in&s;pire every body with concern. Her &s;i&s;ter appeared le&s;s occupi|ed in con&s;oling her, than di&s;&s;atisfied with &s;haring her lot. Nor was &s;he altogether in the wrong. A girl of eighteen, torn from the world, to which &s;he had been re&s;tored, in order to return to a convent as her &s;i&s;ter's companion, might naturally enough con|&s;ider her&s;elf as &s;acrificed by her mother, who in fact had nothing in view but to curb an impetuous temper, which &s;he found her&s;elf unable to govern.

She joined to extreme &s;en&s;ibility the utmo&s;t extravagance of imagination. You could not avoid loving, even while you &s;colded her; and yet it was difficult to live with her upon terms of endear|ment. Poor Sophia had much to &s;uffer from the di&s;|po&s;ition of her &s;i&s;ter, irritated again&s;t her from feel|ings of jealou&s;y, too ju&s;t at the &s;ame time not to e&s;teem her as &s;he de&s;erved, and con&s;equently finding in their intercour&s;e every thing that could tend to provoke that unevenne&s;s of temper, which &s;he her|&s;elf was the fir&s;t to lament. The &s;edatene&s;s of pre|mature rea&s;on was Sophia's principal characteri&s;tic. Her feelings were not very acute, becau&s;e her head was cool and compo&s;ed: but &s;he loved to rea&s;on and re|flect. Gentle, without being forward in her demon|&s;trations of kindne&s;s, &s;he courted nobody's good-will, but obliged every body when an opportunity occurred, never anticipating nor ever oppo&s;ing the wi&s;h of other people. She was fond both of working and reading. Her &s;orrows had affected me; I was plea&s;ed with her demeanour; I felt that I had met with a companion; and we became in&s;eparable. I attached my&s;elf to her with that unre&s;erve which is &s;o natural when we are

in want of an object on which to place our affections, and meet with a per&s;on who &s;eems fit to fill up the va|cancy in our heart. Working, reading, walking, all my occupations and amu&s;ements were &s;hared with Sophia&punc; She was of a religious turn, &s;omewhat le&s;s tender than I, but equally &s;incere; and that re&s;em|blance between us contributed not a little to our inti|macy. It was, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, under the wing of Providence, and in the tran&s;ports of a common zeal, that our friend&s;hip was cultivated. we wi&s;hed reciprocally to &s;upport and forward each other in the road to perfection. Sophia was an unmerciful rea&s;oner: &s;he wanted to analy&s;e, to di&s;cu&s;s, to know every thing. I talked much le&s;s, and laid little &s;tre&s;s upon any thing but re&s;ults. She took a plea&s;ure in conver&s;ing with me, for I was an adept at li&s;tening: and when I differed from her in opinion, my oppo&s;i|tion was &s;o gentle, for fear of offending her, that not one of all our arguments ever produced the &s;malle&s;t di&s;&s;en&s;ion between us. Her &s;ociety was extremely dear to me, for I wi&s;hed to confide to a per&s;on who could under&s;tand me, the &s;entiments which I felt, and which &s;eemed to be heightened by participation. About three years older than my&s;elf, and a little le&s;s ba&s;hful, &s;he had a &s;ort of external advantage which I did not envy her. She prattled prettily and fluently, while I knew only how to an&s;wer. True it is, that people took a particular plea&s;ure in que&s;tioning me; but that was a ta&s;k every one was not equal to. To

my dear friend alone was I truly communicative; others had only, as it were, a glimp&s;e of me, unle&s;s, indeed, it were a per&s;on &s;ufficiently &s;kilful to lift up the veil, which, without intending to hide, I naturally threw over my&s;elf.</P>
<P>HENRIETTA was &s;ometimes, but not often, of our party. She had formed a more <HI>congenial</HI> connection with a Mademoi&s;elle de Cornillon, a girl of eighteen years of age, who was as ugly as &s;in, and as full of wit and mi&s;chief as the devil; a proper hobgoblin, in &s;hort, to frighten children, but who would not have cho&s;en to enter the li&s;ts either again&s;t Sophia's &s;ober rea&s;on or mine.</P>
<P>I CANNOT pa&s;s over in &s;ilence the tender marks of affection that were &s;hewn me from my fir&s;t arrival by an excellent girl, who&s;e unalterable attachment has afford|ed me con&s;olation on more occa&s;ions than one. An|gelica Boufflers, born to no inheritance, had taken the veil at the age of &s;eventeen. She was &s;till ignorant of her own di&s;po&s;ition. Nature had formed her of the mo&s;t combu&s;tible materials; and the compre&s;&s;ion &s;uffered by her energies had exalted the &s;en&s;ibility of her heart, and the vivacity of her mind, to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree. The want of fortune had a&s;&s;igned her a place among the lay &s;i&s;ters, with whom &s;he had nothing in common but the &s;ervility of their functions. There are minds which &s;tand in no need of cultiva|tion. St. Agatha (for that was the name &s;he had a&s;&s;um|ed upon taking the veil), without having much educa|tion

Her worth was known; and though, accord|ing to the u&s;age of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, where the majo|rity are always ungrateful, exce&s;&s;ive labour was im|po&s;ed upon her active di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he enjoyed, ne|verthele&s;s, the re&s;pect that was her due. She was appointed, at that time, to wait upon the boarders; and though &s;he had nobody to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and was entru&s;ted with the care of many things be&s;ide, &s;he found means to get through her bu&s;ine&s;s with equal cheerfulne&s;s and di&s;patch. She had &s;carcely at|tracted my notice, when I had already obtained a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;hare of hers: her kindne&s;s prevented my wi&s;hes, and made me remark her. At table &s;he &s;tudied my ta&s;te unknown to me, and endeavoured to gratify it; in my chamber, &s;he &s;eemed to take a plea&s;ure in making my bed, and never let an oppor|tunity e&s;cape of &s;aying a civil thing. If I met her, &s;he embraced me with tenderne&s;s; and &s;ometimes would take me to her cell, where &s;he had a beautiful canary-bird, which &s;he had tamed, and taught to &s;peak. She even gave me &s;ecretly a key to her apartment, that I might have acce&s;s to it in her ab&s;ence; and there I read the books that compo&s;ed her little library&mdash;the poems of Father du Cerceau, and my&s;tical works in abundance.

from &s;pending a few minutes with me, or were likely to prevent her, I was &s;ure to find a tender billet, which I never failed to an&s;wer; and the&s;e an&s;wers &s;he trea&s;ur|ed up like &s;o many jewels, and &s;hewed me them after|wards carefully locked up in her de&s;k. The attach|ment of &s;i&s;ter Agatha to little Mademoi&s;elle Phlipon &s;oon became the talk of the whole convent; but any one would have &s;uppo&s;ed that it was natural it &s;hould be &s;o; for my fellow-boarders never appeared hurt at the preference. When any of the nuns &s;poke of her partiality, &s;he would a&s;k, with her natural frankne&s;s, whether, in her place, they would not do the &s;ame? and when &s;ome peevi&s;h &s;i&s;ter of four&s;core, mother Gertrude for in&s;tance, told her, that &s;he loved me too well, &s;he replied, that &s;he only thought &s;o becau&s;e incapable of feeling the like affec|tion; 'and you your&s;elf,' added &s;he, 'do you not &s;top her whenever &s;he comes in your way?' Mother Gertrude u&s;ed to turn away, muttering &s;omething between her teeth; but if &s;he met me only half an hour afterwards, &s;he was &s;ure to put &s;ome &s;weetmeats in my hand. When the Mi&s;s Cannets arrived, and I attached my&s;elf to Sophia, Agatha appeared a little jealous, and the nuns took a plea&s;ure in tormenting her; but her generous affection did not dimini&s;h. It &s;eemed as if &s;he was &s;atisfied with my &s;uffering my&s;elf to be loved, and that &s;he enjoyed the plea&s;ure I derived from an intimacy with a per&s;on who&s;e age was nearer to my own, and who&s;e &s;ociety I could command every

Her &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition and her affection have in&s;pired me with the &s;incere&s;t regard for her, which I have ever taken a pride in te&s;tifying.

<P>IT had been re&s;olved upon at my entrance into the convent, that I &s;hould remain there only a year. This I had de&s;ired my&s;elf, as I wi&s;hed to &s;ee bounds &s;et to the &s;acrifice I was about to make by &s;eparating my&s;elf from my mother. The nuns, on their part, when they con&s;ented to my receiving my fir&s;t com|munion in the fourth month of my re&s;idence among them, had taken great care to &s;tipulate that I &s;hould not leave them the &s;ooner on that account, and that I &s;hould complete the period agreed upon. The year having revolved, I had left the convent. My mother informed me that my grandmother Phlipon, who was extremely fond of me, wi&s;hed me much to remain with her &s;ome time, and that my mother had con&s;ented to my going, conceiving it could not be di&s;agreeable to me, as &s;he &s;hould be able to &s;ee me there more frequently than at the convent: that ar|rangement, be&s;ide, was perfectly &s;uitable to circum|&s;tances. My father had been cho&s;en into &s;ome office of his pari&s;h, and on that account was forced to be frequently from home. I readily under&s;tood that my
<PB N="60" REF="034483_0422_0FFDEC8C6C8041F8">
mother, being obliged at pre&s;ent to direct her atten|tion to the work entru&s;ted to the young men, about whom &s;he had hitherto given her&s;elf no concern, had lo&s;t a portion of her liberty, which &s;he would have wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve entire, in order to be&s;tow her whole time upon me.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation &s;he propo&s;ed to me was indeed a gentle tran&s;ition from the ab&s;ence I had lately experienced to a complete return to her, and I ac|cepted it the more readily, as I had a great liking for my grandmother. She was a graceful, good-humoured little woman, who&s;e agreeable manners, poli&s;hed language, gracious &s;mile, and &s;ignificant looks, &s;till announced &s;ome preten&s;ions to plea&s;e, or at lea&s;t to remind us that &s;he had once been a plea&s;ing object. She was &s;ixty-five or &s;ixty-&s;ix years of age, and &s;till paid attention to her dre&s;s, taking care, however, to &s;uit it to her years; for &s;he prided her&s;elf above all things on the &s;tudy and ob&s;erv|ance of decorum. Con&s;iderable corpulence, a light &s;tep, an upright carriage, hand&s;ome little hands, of which the fingers were gracefully di&s;played, and a &s;entimental &s;tyle of conver&s;ation, intermingled with &s;allies of dignified mirth, took away from her every appearance of age. She was a delightful companion for young women, who&s;e &s;ociety plea&s;ed her, and of who&s;e attentions &s;he was proud. Becoming a widow immediately upon the termination of the fir&s;t year of her marriage, my father, born after the death of her
<PB N="61" REF="034483_0423_0FFDEC90367B9DD8">
hu&s;band, was her only child. Misfortunes in trade having reduced her to di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he had been obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;ome di&s;tant relations, who were living in opulence, and who employed her, in prefer|ence to any body el&s;e, in the education of their chil|dren. Thus, for in&s;tance, at Madam Boi&s;morel's &s;he brought up both her &s;on Roberge, of whom I &s;hall &s;peak in the &s;equel, and her daughter, afterwards Madame de Favieres. A little e&s;tate which devolved to her by inheritance, having rendered her indepen|dent, &s;he retired to the I&s;land of St. Louis, where &s;he occupied a decent apartment with her &s;i&s;ter, Made|moi&s;elle Roti&s;&s;et, whom &s;he called Angelica. This worthy maiden, a&s;thmatic and devout, as virtuous as an angel, and as &s;imple as a child, was entirely devoted to her elder &s;i&s;ter. The affairs of the little hou&s;ehold devolved entirely on her. A char-woman, who attended twice a day, performed the more menial offices; but every thing el&s;e was done by Angelica, who dre&s;&s;ed her &s;i&s;ter with the mo&s;t reverend care. She naturally became my governante, at the &s;ame time that Madame Phlipon undertook to be my teacher. Behold me, then, in their hands, after having quit|ted the hou&s;e of God, regretted, beloved, and embra|ced by the whole &s;i&s;terhood of nuns, wept over by my Agatha and my Sophia, lamenting my &s;eparation from them, and promi&s;ing to mitigate its pains by the frequency of my vi&s;its.</P>
<P>THIS engagement was too dear to my heart not to
<PB N="62" REF="034483_0424_0FFDEC91C6E07F80">
be &s;crupulou&s;ly fulfilled. My walks were frequently directed towards the Congregation, my aunt Angeli|ca and my father taking a plea&s;ure in accompanying me thither. The news of my arrival in the parlour u&s;ed to run like lightning through the convent; and in the cour&s;e of an hour I had interviews with twenty different per&s;ons. But tho&s;e vi&s;its, after all, were poor &s;ub&s;titutes for the daily and confidential inter|cour&s;e of friend&s;hip. They became le&s;s frequent, and I filled up the intervals with an epi&s;tolary corre&s;|pondence, in which my Sophia bore the greate&s;t part. That was the origin of my fondne&s;s for compo&s;ition, and one of the cau&s;es that, by giving me a greater ha|bit of writing, gave me al&s;o a greater facility.</P>

<P>I HAD completed my twelfth year, and the thir|teenth was pa&s;&s;ing away under the care of my grand|mother. The quiet of her hou&s;e, and the piety of my aunt Angelica, accorded admirably with the ten|der and contemplative di&s;po&s;ition I had brought with me from the convent. Every morning Angelica ac|companied me to church to hear ma&s;s, where I was &s;oon remarked by tho&s;e monopolizers of con|&s;ciences, who make a merit with God of peopling the cloi&s;ters. The reverend Abb&eacute; G&eacute;ry, with his wry neck and downca&s;t eye, acco&s;ted the per&s;on whom he took for my governante, to congratulate her on the edification produced by the example of her pupil, and to te&s;tify the &s;trong de&s;ire he felt to be her guide in the ways of the Lord. He learned with regret, that the grand ceremonies were already over, and that I had put my con&s;cience into other hands. He then de&s;ired to know from my own mouth,
<PB N="73" REF="034483_0435_0FFDECB12E970C38">
whether I had not begun to think of my future de&s;ti|nation, and of bidding farewell to the vanities of the world. I an&s;wered, that I was too young yet to know my vocation. Mon&s;ieur G&eacute;ry &s;ighed, &s;aid &s;everal fine things to me, and did not fail to place him|&s;elf in my way out, in order to bow to me devoutly. The piety of my young heart did not go &s;o far as to be gratified with je&s;uitical affectations: it was too &s;in|cere to join hands with the ab&s;urdities of bigotry, and the wry neck of Mon&s;ieur G&eacute;ry was not at all to my ta&s;te. I had neverthele&s;s a &s;ecret de&s;ign of devoting my&s;elf to the mona&s;tic life. St. Francis de Sales, one of the mo&s;t amiable &s;aints in Paradi&s;e, had made a conque&s;t of my heart, and the ladies of the Vi&s;itation of which he was the founder, were already my adop|tive &s;i&s;ters. But I was well &s;atisfied, that, being an only child, I &s;hould not obtain my parents' con&s;ent to take the veil during my minority, and was unwilling to give them unnece&s;&s;ary concern by any premature di&s;clo&s;ure of my &s;entiments.

What doctrines of &s;piritual love! what delicious aliment for the innocence of a fervent &s;oul, abandoned to cele&s;tial illu&s;ions! Some

controver&s;ial writings of Bo&s;&s;uet furni&s;hed me with fre&s;h food for my mind: favourable as they were to the cau&s;e which they defended, they &s;ometimes let me into the &s;ecret of objections that might be made to it, and &s;et me on &s;crutinizing my articles of faith. That was my fir&s;t &s;tep; but it was infinitely remote from the &s;ceptici&s;m, at which in a cour&s;e of years I was de&s;tined to arrive, after having been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively Jan|&s;eni&s;t, Carte&s;ian, Stoic, and Dei&s;t. What a route, to terminate at la&s;t in patrioti&s;m, which has conduct|ed me to a dungeon! In the mid&s;t of all this, &s;ome old books of travels, and mythology in abundance, amu&s;ed my imagination, while the letters of Madam de Sevign&eacute; fixed my ta&s;te. Her delightful ea&s;e, her elegance, her vivacity, her tenderne&s;s, made me en|ter into her intimacy. I became acquainted with her &s;ociety; I was as much familiarized with her manners and the circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation, as if I had pa&s;&s;ed my life with her.

Madam Be&s;nard, the &s;ame great aunt who had paid &s;o much attention to me while I was at nur&s;e, came every afternoon to pa&s;s an hour or two with her &s;i&s;ter. Her au&s;tere di&s;po&s;ition was always accompanied by a &s;olemn &s;ort of formality, and an air of ceremony, upon which Madam Phlipon would &s;ometimes rally

<P>MY grandmother one day took it into her head to pay a vi&s;it to Madam de Boi&s;morel, either for the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, or for that of exhibiting her grand-daughter. Great were the preparations in con&s;equence, and tedious my dre&s;&s;ing, which began at break of day; at length off we &s;et with my aunt Angelica, for the <HI>Rue St. Louis au Marais,</HI> and reached it about noon.

She an&s;wered every body in the kinde&s;t but at the &s;ame time in the mo&s;t dignified manner; and &s;o far all went well. But her grand|daughter was perceived; for &s;he could not deny her|&s;elf the plea&s;ure of pointing her out to ob&s;ervation, and the <HI>&s;ervants</HI> mu&s;t needs pay fine compliments to the young lady. I had a &s;ort of uncomfortable feeling, for which I could not account, but which I perceived
<PB N="77" REF="034483_0439_0FFDECBACC4AE190">
neverthele&s;s to proceed in part from the idea that &s;er|vants might look at and admire me, but that it was not their bu&s;ine&s;s to pay me compliments. We pa&s;&s;ed on: were announced by a tall footman, and walked into the parlour, where we &s;ound Madam de Boi&s;morel &s;eated upon what was then called not an <HI>ottomane,</HI> but a <HI>canap&eacute;,</HI> and embroidering with great gravity. Madam de Boi&s;morel was of the &s;ame age, &s;tature, and cor|pulence as my grandmother; but her dre&s;s be&s;poke le&s;s ta&s;te than de&s;ire to di&s;play her opulence and indi|cate her rank; while her countenance, far from ex|pre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h to plea&s;e, announced her claims to re|&s;pect, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her merit. A rich lace, puckered into the &s;hape of a cap, with wings pointed at the ends, like the ears of a hare, was placed upon the top of her head, and allowed her hair to be &s;een, which was probably not of her own growth, and was dre&s;&s;ed with that affected di&s;cretion which it is very nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ume at &s;ixty years of age; while rouge, an inch thick, gave her unmeaning eyes a much more unfeeling look than was nece&s;&s;ary, to make me fix mine upon the ground.&mdash;'Ah!

Our conver&s;ation was at once guard|ed and familiar: M. de Boi&s;morel took care not to let &s;lip the opportunity of making hand&s;ome mention of the obligations he owed to my grandmother's care; and I ea&s;ily under&s;tood that he was hinting to her in an ob&s;cure but delicate manner, that providence had rewarded her generous attention to other people's children, by giving her &s;o promi&s;ing a grand-child of her own.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT M. de Boi&s;morel infinitely more amiable than his mother, and was delighted when|ever he called upon us, which was generally once in two or three months. He had married at an early age, a very charming woman, and had a &s;on by her, who&s;e education occupied a con&s;iderable portion of his thoughts. He had undertaken it him&s;elf, and was
<PB N="82" REF="034483_0444_0FFDECC99BD28F00">
de&s;irous of directing it by philo&s;ophical views, in which he was not a little thwarted by the prejudices of his mother, and the enthu&s;ia&s;tic devotion of his wife. He was accu&s;ed of &s;ingularity; and as his nerves had been affected in con&s;equence of a dreadful inflamma|tory di&s;order, the old counte&s;&s;es, the &s;olemn lawyers, and the &s;pruce abb&eacute;s of his family, or of his mother's acquaintance, a&s;cribed to a derangement of the brain, re&s;ulting from di&s;ea&s;e, the conduct he pur&s;ued in bringing up his boy. The&s;e circum&s;tances, when they came to my knowledge, excited much of my attention: it appeared to me that every thing which this &s;ingular man &s;aid was very much to the purpo&s;e, and I began to &s;u&s;pect there were two &s;orts of rea&s;on, if I may &s;ay &s;o, one for the clo&s;et and another for the world; a morality of principle, and a morality of practice, from the contradiction of which re&s;ulted &s;o many ab&s;urdities, &s;ome of which did not altogether e&s;cape my ob&s;ervation; in &s;hort, that per&s;ons of the gay world called every body in&s;ane, who was not affected with the common infanity: and thus did materials for reflection in&s;en&s;ibly accumulate in my active brain.</P>
<P>MY grandmother &s;ometimes compared the &s;en|timents and behaviour of Mr. de Boi&s;morel with tho&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter, Madam de Favi&egrave;res, of whom &s;he had &s;ome rea&s;on to complain; who&s;e brother had found it nece&s;&s;ary to remind her that Mademoi&s;elle Roti&s;&s;et was their own relation (a circum&s;tance, &s;aid I

to my&s;elf, that their mother appears either not to know, or not inclined to acknowledge), and to whom &s;he had no de&s;ire to introduce me, any more than I to be introduced&mdash;which indeed &s;he was &s;o well aware of, that &s;he never even propo&s;ed a &s;econd vi&s;it to Madam de Boi&s;morel.</P>
<P>MY father had vacated his office; the year to be &s;pent with my grandmother had elap&s;ed; and I re|turned to the arms of my indulgent mother. But it was not without regret that I left the hand&s;ome &s;treets of the <HI>I&s;le St. Louis,</HI> the plea&s;ant quays, and the tranquil banks of the Seine, where I was ac|cu&s;tomed to take the air with my aunt Angelica, in the &s;erene &s;ummer evenings, contemplating the wind|ing cour&s;e of the river, and the exten&s;ive land&s;cape beyond it&mdash;quays, along which I u&s;ed to pa&s;s, with|out meeting in my &s;olitary way with any object to interrupt my meditations, when in the fervency of my zeal I was repairing to the temple in order to pour out my whole &s;oul at the foot of the altar. My grand|mother's gaiety gave charms to her habitation, in which I had &s;pent many plea&s;ant and peaceful days. I took leave of her with a flood of tears; notwith|&s;tanding my attachment to my mother, who&s;e merit, of a more &s;olid kind, was accompanied by a re&s;erve, with which I had not till then made any compari&s;on that could make it appear le&s;s attractive, as at that moment it &s;truck me in a confu&s;ed manner.

of the Seine, it was &s;till upon its banks that I was going to re&s;ide; but the &s;ituation of my father's hou&s;e was not quiet and &s;olitary like that of my grandmother. The moving picture of the <HI>Pont-Neuf</HI> varied the &s;cene every moment, and I entered li|terally as well as figuratively into the world, when I returned under my paternal roof. A free air, how|ever, and an unconfined &s;pace, &s;till gave &s;cope to my romantic and wandering imagination. How many times from my window, which fronted the north, have I contemplated, with emotion, the va&s;t expan&s;e of heaven, and its azure dome de&s;igned with &s;o much grandeur, and &s;tretching from the grey ea&s;t beyond the <HI>Pont au Change</HI> to the trees of the mall, and the hou&s;es of Chaillot, re&s;plendent with the ruddy beams of the &s;etting &s;un! Never did I fail to employ a few moments in this way at the clo&s;e of every fine day, and often have tears of de|light &s;tolen down my cheeks in &s;ilence, while my heart, dilated by a &s;entiment not to be de&s;cribed, and happy in the idea and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence, was offering to the Supreme Being a pure homage of gratitude worthy of his acceptance. I know not if &s;en&s;ibility give a more vivid hue to every ob|ject, or if certain &s;ituations, which do not appear very remarkable, contribute powerfully to develope it, or if both be not reciprocally cau&s;e and effect: but when I review the events of my life, I find it dif|ficult to a&s;&s;ign to circum&s;tances, or to my di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="85" REF="034483_0447_0FFDECD1A42F4288">
that variety and that plenitude of affection, which have marked &s;o &s;trongly every point of its duration, and left me &s;o clear a remembrance of every place at which I have been.</P>
<P>CAJOU had &s;till continued to teach me mu&s;ic. He was fond of making me talk over the theory, or rather the mechani&s;m of his art; for though &s;ome|thing of a compo&s;er, he under&s;tood little of mathe|matics, and of metaphy&s;ics le&s;s: but he was ambitious of communicating to me all he knew. He was almo&s;t as much afflicted at my want of ex|pre&s;&s;ion in &s;inging, as a&s;toni&s;hed at the ea&s;e with which I pur&s;ued a chain of rea&s;oning. 'Put &s;oul into it!' he would continually exclaim: You &s;ing an air as nuns chant an anthem.' The poor man did not perceive that I had too much &s;oul to be able to put it in a &s;ong: and indeed I was as much embarra&s;&s;ed to give the proper expre&s;&s;ion to a tender pa&s;&s;age of mu&s;ic, as I &s;hould formerly have been in reading aloud the epi&s;ode of Eucharis or Erminia. Being &s;uddenly transformed into the per&s;onage &s;uppo&s;|ed to be &s;peaking, I was no longer capable of imita|tion; I experienced the &s;entiment to be de&s;cribed; my breathing grew &s;hort; my voice faltered; and difficulties re&s;ulted thence, which I could not over|come in a flat and &s;erious &s;tyle of &s;inging; for I could not prevail upon my&s;elf to act the impa&s;&s;ioned lover.</P>

the e&s;teem of my grandmother, had begun, while I was with her, to teach me the guitar, and continued to give me le&s;&s;ons when I returned to my father's. The common accompaniments did not co&s;t me many months to execute; and <HI>Mignard</HI> afterwards took a plea&s;ure in forwarding my improvement, till in the end I &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my ma&s;ter. <HI>Mozon</HI> was recalled to perfect my dancing, as was <HI>Mr. Demure,</HI> to keep up my arithmetic, geography, writing, and hi&s;tory. My father made me re&s;ume the graver, confining me to the mo&s;t trifling branch of the art, to which he thought to attach me by the tie of intere&s;t; for having taught me enough to make me of &s;ome u&s;e, he gave me little jobs to do, of which he &s;hared the profit with me at the end of the week, according to a book which he de&s;ired me to keep. But I &s;oon became weary of this; nothing was &s;o in&s;ipid to me, as to engrave the edge of a watch-ca&s;e, or to ornament a bauble; I liked much better to read a good author, than to buy a riband. I did not conceal my di&s;gu&s;t; and as no con|&s;traint was laid upon me, I threw a&s;ide the graver, and have never touched it &s;ince. I went out every morning with my mother to hear ma&s;s: after which we &s;ometimes made our little purcha&s;es. When the time required for the&s;e purpo&s;es, and the hours de|voted to the le&s;&s;ons of my different ma&s;ters, were over, I retired to my clo&s;et to read, to write, and to meditate. The long evenings made me return to my needle-works, during which my mother had
<PB N="87" REF="034483_0449_0FFDECD5E0058A50">
the complai&s;ance to read to me for hours together. The&s;e readings gave me great plea&s;ure; but as they did not permit me to dige&s;t things to my entire &s;ati&s;|faction, I conceived the idea of making extracts. Ac|cordingly, my fir&s;t employment in the morning was to con&s;ign to paper what had &s;truck me mo&s;t forcibly the preceding evening; and this done, I returned to the book to recover the connexion, or to copy a pa&s;&s;age, that I was de&s;irous of having entire. This grew into a habit, a pa&s;&s;ion, a perfect rage. My fa|ther having only the little library, which I had for|merly exhau&s;ted, I borrowed and hired books, and could not bear the idea of returning them till I had made what I conceived the be&s;t part of their contents my own. In this manner I demoli&s;hed <HI>Pluche, Rollin, Crevier,</HI> the <HI>P&egrave;re d'Orleans, St. Real,</HI> the <HI>Abb&eacute; de Vertot,</HI> and <HI>Mezeray,</HI> who &s;o little re&s;embles the lat|ter; Mezeray, the drie&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible writers, but the hi&s;torian of my country, with the annals of which I wi&s;hed to be acquainted.</P>
<P>MY grandmother Bimont was dead. My little uncle &s;ettled at St. Bartholomew's, in a better place than that of ma&s;ter of the choir, boarded with the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, the Abb&eacute; le Jay, who kept a very tolerable hou&s;e, where we u&s;ed to go and pa&s;s the evening on Sundays and holidays, after divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE Abb&eacute; le Jay was a good old man, clum&s;y both in body and mind, a wretched preacher, an
<PB N="88" REF="034483_0450_0FFDECD8AFFA6110">
unmerciful confe&s;&s;or, a ca&s;ui&s;t, and the Lord knows what be&s;ide. But he was by no means blind to his own intere&s;t: he had found means to help on his two brothers, and to get them e&s;tabli&s;hed as nota|ries at Paris, where they made a figure in their profe&s;&s;ion, at that time both reputable and lucra|tive. His own hou&s;e was kept by one of his rela|tions, a Mademoi&s;elle d'Hannaches, tall, dry, and fallow, with a &s;hrill voice, proud of her de&s;cent, and tiring every body with her economical arrange|ments, and her pedigree. She was a woman how|ever, and that always enlivens the hou&s;e of a prie&s;t: be&s;ides, &s;he contrived to keep a neat and plentiful table for her cou&s;in, who was a great <HI>amateur</HI> of good eating. The Abb&eacute; found it extremely agreeable to have a boarder in his hou&s;e of the amiable di&s;po&s;i|tion of my uncle Bimont: his table was more cheer|ful, Mademoi&s;elle d'Hannaches better tempered, and his party of tric-trac<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A game re&s;embling backgammon, but &s;ometimes played by four per&s;ons.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE> never failed: my mother and the cou&s;in were partners; and as to me, who &s;eemed thus to be de&s;erted, I was not at all di&s;plea&s;|ed at my four friends amu&s;ing them&s;elves in that way; for the Abb&eacute; le Jay received company in a large library, which I laid under contribution without mercy. This was a &s;ource which I re|curred to as long as he lived; &s;omething le&s;s than
<PB N="89" REF="034483_0451_1000F664E1459400">
three years. One of his brothers having ruined him&s;elf, the Abb&eacute; lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, langui&s;hed for &s;ix weeks, threw him&s;elf out of a window, and died of his fall. Mademoi&s;elle d'Hannaches, then at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w for the inheritance of her uncle, <HI>the captain,</HI> was accommodated in my mother's hou&s;e, and re&s;ided with us a year and a half. During that period I was her &s;ecretary: I wrote her letters, copied her dear genealogy, drew up petitions which &s;he pre|&s;ented to the pre&s;ident and attorney-general of the parliament of Paris, who were left tru&s;tees of the annuities bequeathed by a Mr. de St. Vallier to poor gentlewomen; and &s;ometimes accompanied her when &s;he went to make intere&s;t with various per|&s;ons of con&s;equence. I ea&s;ily perceived that, not|with&s;tanding her ignorance, her &s;tiff demeanour, her bad way of expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, her old-fa&s;hioned dre&s;s, and her other ab&s;urdities, re&s;pect was paid to her origin. The names of her ance&s;tors, which &s;he never failed to repeat, were attended to, and great pains were taken to obtain for her what &s;he de&s;ired. I compared the honourable reception &s;he met with, with that given me by Madam de Boi&s;morel, which had left a deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mind; I could not help feeling my &s;uperiority over Mademoi&s;elle d'Han|naches, who with her genealogy, and at the age of forty, was unable to write a line of common &s;en&s;e, or a legible hand; and it appeared to me that the
<PB N="90" REF="034483_0452_1000F64D1FAC1010">
world was extremely unju&s;t, and the in&s;titutions of &s;ociety highly ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>BUT let us &s;ee for a moment what was become of my friends at the convent. My Agatha now and then wrote me letters in the &s;tyle of tenderne&s;s pe|culiar to tho&s;e plaintive doves, who dared not indulge in any thing farther than friend&s;hip; a &s;tyle rendered &s;till more affectionate by her ardent &s;oul. Little boxes, pincu&s;hions, and &s;weetmeats, accompanied them, whenever &s;uch pre&s;ents were within her reach. I went occa&s;ionally to &s;ee her; and was even admitted into the interior of the convent at a fe&s;tival given in honour of the &s;uperior; a privilege they had taken care to in&s;ure me, by obtaining unknown to me a li|cence from the archbi&s;hop, which was afterwards pre|&s;ented me as a &s;pecial favour, and received by me as &s;uch. Every thing was in motion, the young ladies were well dre&s;&s;ed, the hall was adorned with flowers, and the refectory &s;tuffed full of dainty ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in the&s;e entertainments of poor &s;ecluded virgins, in which no doubt &s;omething childi&s;h may be found, there is al&s;o &s;omething amia|ble, ingenuous, and graceful, which belongs only to the gentlene&s;s of women, to their lively imagination, and innocent playfulne&s;s, when they make merry among them&s;elves at a di&s;tance from a &s;ex, that al|ways renders them more &s;erious, when it does not completely turn their brain. A &s;hort drama, rather dull, but enlivened by the voices of little girls
<PB N="91" REF="034483_0453_1000F64EA29C84F8">
&s;inging a few &s;tanzas in chorus, was the fir&s;t rally|ing point: &s;portive dances &s;ucceeded; at one time &s;ome excellent joke, and at another an arch laugh, the more humorous, becau&s;e making a greater contra&s;t with their habitual gravity, gave a true Saturnalian character to the &s;ports of the good &s;i&s;ters and their pupils.</P>
<P>THE phy&s;ician coming by chance to the infirmary to vi&s;it his patients, it was impo&s;&s;ible to do other|wi&s;e than invite him to a &s;ight of the entertainment. He was accordingly conducted under a cloi&s;ter hung with fe&s;toons of flowers, where a &s;ort of fair was e&s;tabli&s;hed. There young novices were &s;elling bal|lads, others were di&s;tributing cakes, one was drawing a lottery, and another telling fortunes, while the lit|tle girls were loaded with ba&s;kets of fruit and, a con|cert was performing on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. At the &s;ight of the doctor's wig, the novices pulled their veils over their faces; the elder boarders looked at their dre&s;s, to &s;ee whether it was in di&s;order; the younger girls a&s;&s;umed a graver air; and I held my guitar in a le&s;s negligent manner. It was &s;u&s;pended before me by a riband pa&s;&s;ed over my &s;houlder. The nuns had in&s;i&s;ted upon hearing me &s;ing, and the occa&s;ion had in&s;pired me with two &s;tanzas indifferent in them&s;elves, but &s;o well timed as to be received with unbounded applau&s;e. Even Cajou would have been &s;atisfied with the manner in which I &s;ung them; for having no &s;entiments to expre&s;s but &s;uch as I could indulge,
<PB N="92" REF="034483_0454_1000F650379FCEA0">
my accents were perfectly unre&s;trained. I was de&s;ired to repeat them before the phy&s;ician: but that was a very different affair; my voice faltered, and my ex|pre&s;&s;ion became ob&s;cure. An old nun remarked it, and &s;aid with an arch look, that it only made my counte|nance &s;o much the more intere&s;ting. At length the doctor withdrew, every body being glad he was gone, though nobody would have wi&s;hed him not to have been there.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> had returned to her family at Amiens; but previou&s;ly to her departure we had prevailed upon our mothers to &s;ee one another. They had in a manner con&s;ecrated our connexion, had reciprocal|ly applauded their daughters' choice, and &s;miled at our promi&s;es, of never forgetting each other, which we called upon them to witne&s;s. Tho&s;e promi&s;es, however, were better kept than they imagined, notwith&s;tanding certain modifications of which my readers hereafter will be able to judge. My corre&s;|pondence with my friend was regularly carried on. I wrote to her always once a week, and generally twice.&mdash;'And what,' methinks I hear it a&s;ked, 'could you have to relate?'&mdash;Every thing I &s;aw, thought, felt, or perceived: &s;urely then I could not be in want of &s;omething to &s;ay! Our corre&s;|pondence gave facility to it&s;elf, and furni&s;hed its own materials, by communicating my reflections, I learned the better to reflect; I &s;tudied with more ardour, becau&s;e I took a plea&s;ure in &s;haring what I
<PB N="93" REF="034483_0455_1000F65471441368">
acquired; and I made my ob&s;ervations with the greater care, becau&s;e I found entertainment in com|mitting them to paper. Sophia's letters were le&s;s frequent: a numerous family, a crowded hou&s;e, the forms of &s;ociety, and the very nature of a provin|cial life, occupied by trifles, by unmeaning vi&s;its, and of which a part is nece&s;&s;arily devoted to cards, left her neither the lei&s;ure to write, nor the means of collecting &s;uch abundant materials. For that rea&s;on perhaps &s;he &s;et the greater value on the letters &s;he received from me, and pre&s;&s;ed me more earne&s;tly to write.</P>

by <HI>Andr&eacute;</HI> Baillet; <HI>Bo&s;&s;uet</HI>'s Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory; the letters of <HI>St. Jer&ocirc;me,</HI> and the romance of <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> with a thou&s;and others equally congruous:&mdash; this library failing me, I was forced to have recour&s;e to the book&s;ellers. My father being ill qualified to &s;elect, a&s;ked for whatever I pointed out, my choice generally falling on the works of which I had been enabled to form &s;ome idea by the quotations and ex|tracts I had found in tho&s;e I had already read. In that way tran&s;lations of Diodorus Siculus, and other ancient hi&s;torians, attracted my notice. I was al&s;o de&s;irous of reading the hi&s;tory of my own country in &s;ome other writer be&s;ides Mezeray, and accordingly pitched upon the Abb&eacute; <HI>Velly,</HI> and his continuators far le&s;s intere&s;ting than him&s;elf, in pe|riods, where, with his talents, they might have been more &s;o. <HI>Pa&s;cal, Monte&s;quieu, Locke, Burlamaqui,</HI> and the principal Fr&eacute;nch dramati&s;ts, next engaged my attention. I had no plan, nor any end in view, but to improve my&s;elf and acquire knowledge. I felt a fort of nece&s;&s;ity of exerci&s;ing the activity of my mind, and of gratifying my &s;erious propen&s;ities. I panted after happine&s;s, and could find it only in a powerful exertion of my faculties. I know not what I might have become, if placed in the hands of a &s;kilful preceptor: it is probable that by apply|ing &s;olely or principally to a particular &s;tudy, I might have extended &s;ome branch of &s;cience, or have acquired talents of a &s;uperior kind. But &s;hould I have
<PB N="95" REF="034483_0457_1000F65775893340">
been better or more u&s;eful? That is a que&s;tion which I leave others to re&s;olve: certain it is, that I could not have been more happy. I know of nothing comparable to that plenitude of life, of peace, of &s;atisfaction, to tho&s;e days of innocence and &s;tudy. They were not, however, unmixed with trouble, from which the life of man upon earth is never exempt.</P>
<P>I HAD generally &s;everal books on hand at a time, &s;ome &s;erving for &s;tudy, others &s;tanding me in the &s;tead of recreation. Hi&s;torical works of length, as I have already ob&s;erved, were read aloud in the evening, which was almo&s;t the only time I &s;pent with my mo|ther. The whole of the day I pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;olitude of the clo&s;et, in making extracts, or in meditation. As long as the fine weather la&s;ted, we went on holidays to the public walks; and my father carried me be|&s;ides to all the exhibitions either of pictures or other works of art, &s;o frequent at Paris in tho&s;e days of luxury, and of pro&s;perity, as it was then called. He enjoyed him&s;elf much on the&s;e occa&s;ions, when he had it in his power to make an agreeable di&s;play of his &s;uperiority by pointing out to my ob&s;ervation what he under&s;tood better than I; and was proud of the ta&s;te I di&s;covered as of his own work. That was our point of contract: in tho&s;e ca&s;es we were truly in uni&s;on. My father never lo&s;t an opportunity of &s;hew|ing him&s;elf to advantage; and it was evident that he was fond of being &s;een in public, giving his arm to a well-dre&s;&s;ed young woman, who&s;e blooming appear|ance
<PB N="96" REF="034483_0458_1000F66165503730">
frequently produced a murmur of admiration grateful to his ears. If any one acco&s;ted him, doubtful of the relation in which we &s;tood to each other, he would &s;ay, 'My daughter,' with an air of mode&s;t triumph, which I was not the la&s;t to perceive, and which affected me without making me vain, for I a&s;cribed it entirely to parental affec|tion. If I chanced to &s;peak, he might be &s;een examining, in tho&s;e around, the effect of my voice, or of the good &s;en&s;e I might have uttered, and a&s;k|ing them by his looks, if he had not rea&s;on to be proud. I was &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e things; and they &s;ome|times made me more timid, without producing any awkward feeling: it &s;eemed incumbent upon me to make amends by my mode&s;ty for my father's pride. In the mean time, how did the&s;e worldly amu&s;e|ments, the&s;e arts, the images they call up, and the de&s;ire to plea&s;e, &s;o natural and &s;o &s;trong in woman|kind, agree with my devotion, my &s;tudies, my &s;o|ber rea&s;on, and my faith? That was preci&s;ely the origin of the trouble of which I have been &s;peaking, and of which the progre&s;s and effects are well worthy of an explanation rather difficult to give.</P>
<P>WITH the bulk of mankind, formed rather to feel than to think, the pa&s;&s;ions give the fir&s;t &s;hock to their creed, when that creed has been imbibed from education. What but pa&s;&s;ion produces &s;uch con|tradictions between the principles that have been adop|ted,
<PB N="97" REF="034483_0459_1000F64B9D130DE0">
the de&s;ires that tho&s;e principles cannot extingui&s;h, and the in&s;titutions of a government ill calculated to reconcile them? But in a young mind accu&s;tomed to reflect, and placed out of the reach of the &s;educ|tions of the world, it is rea&s;on which fir&s;t gives the alarm, and urges us to examine, before we have any intere&s;t to doubt. If my inquietude, however, had no &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations in view, it was not, on that account, independent of my &s;en&s;ibility: I thought through the medium of my heart; while my rea&s;on, though ob&s;erving a &s;trict impartiality, was by no means unconcerned in the operations of the mind.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing that &s;hocked me in that religion, which I profe&s;&s;ed with the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;olid and con&s;i&s;tent mind, was the univer&s;al damnation of all tho&s;e by whom it is denied, or to whom it has re|mained unknown. When, in&s;tructed by hi&s;tory, I had well con&s;idered the extent of the earth, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, the progre&s;s of empires, the vir|tues and the errors of &s;o many nations, I perceived weakne&s;s, ab&s;urdity, and impiety, in the idea of a creator, who devotes to eternal torments tho&s;e innumerable beings, the frail works of his hands, ca&s;t on the earth in the mid&s;t of &s;o many perils, and lo&s;t in a night of ignorance, from which they have already had &s;o much to &s;uffer. 'I am deceived in this article of my creed, it is evident: am I not equally wrong in &s;ome other? Let me examine.'&mdash;

From the moment a catholic has arrived at this &s;tage of rea&s;oning, he is lo&s;t for ever to the church. I ea&s;ily conceive why prie&s;ts require a blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and preach up &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly that religious faith, which adopts without examination, and adores without murmuring; this is the ba&s;is of their em|pire, which is de&s;troyed as &s;oon as we begin to in|ve&s;tigate. Next to the cruelty of damnation, the ab|&s;urdity of infallibility &s;truck me the mo&s;t; and very &s;oon it was rejected likewi&s;e. 'What truth is there then remaining?'&mdash;That became the object of a re|&s;earch continued, during a number of years, with an activity, and &s;ometimes with an anxiety, of mind, difficult to de&s;cribe. Critical, moral, philo&s;ophical, and metaphy&s;ical writers became my favourite &s;tudy. I was on the hunt after whatever could point them out to me; and their analy&s;is and compari&s;on became my principal employ. I had lo&s;t my confe&s;&s;or, the monk of St. Victor's: the good M. Lallement was dead, to who&s;e worth and di&s;cretion I am happy to have an opportunity of bearing witne&s;s. Being un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of making choice of &s;ome per&s;on to &s;ucceed him, I ca&s;t my eyes upon the Abb&eacute; Morel, who belonged to our pari&s;h, and whom I had &s;een at my uncle's: he was a little man, by no means wanting in under&s;tanding, and profe&s;&s;ing the great|e&s;t au&s;terity of principles, which was the motive that determined me in my choice. When my faith wavered, he was &s;ure to be the fir&s;t informed of it;
<PB N="99" REF="034483_0461_1000F667E4721FB8">
for I never could tell any thing but the truth. He was eager to put into my hands the apologi&s;ts and champions of Chri&s;tianity. Behold me then clo|&s;eted with the Abb&eacute; <HI>Gauchat,</HI> the Abb&eacute; <HI>Bergier, Ab|badie, Holland, Clarke,</HI> and the re&s;t of the reverend phalanx.&mdash;I peru&s;ed them with critical &s;everity, and &s;ometimes made notes, which I left in the book when I returned it to the Abb&eacute; Morel, who a&s;ked with a&s;toni&s;hment if I had written and conceived them. The mo&s;t whim&s;ical part of the &s;tory is, that it was from the&s;e works that I fir&s;t got an idea of tho&s;e which they pretended to refute, and noted down their titles in order to procure them. In this way did the trea|ti&s;e on <HI>Toleration,</HI> the <HI>Dictionnaire Philo&s;ophique, Que&s;tions concerning the Encyclopedie,</HI> the <HI>Bon Sens</HI> of the Marquis d'Argens, the <HI>Jewi&s;h Letters,</HI> the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h Spy, les Moeurs, l'E&s;prit, Diderot, d'Alembert, Raynal,</HI> and the <HI>Sy&s;teme de la Nature,</HI> pa&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly through my hands.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s of my mind was not going on alone. Nature was making hers in every way. Although my mother had never preci&s;ely told me what I had to expect, &s;he had occa&s;ionally &s;aid enough on the &s;ubject in my pre&s;ence, and my grandmother in par|ticular had amu&s;ed her&s;elf too much by certain pre|dictions, to leave any room for a&s;toni&s;hment at the event.</P>
<P>I REMARKED it with a &s;ort of joy, as an initiation

into the cla&s;s of grown per&s;ons, and I announced it to my mother, who embraced me tenderly, de|lighted at the idea of my having pa&s;&s;ed &s;o happily through a period, during which &s;he had been alarmed for my health. Previou&s;ly to this occurrence I had been &s;ometimes rou&s;ed in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner from the mo&s;t profound &s;leep. My imagination had no concern in the bu&s;ine&s;s: it was too much occupied with &s;erious &s;ubjects, and my timorous con&s;cience guarded it too &s;crupulou&s;ly again&s;t amu&s;ing it&s;elf with others, for it to be po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould pre&s;ent to me what I had never allowed my&s;elf to try to compre|hend. But an extraordinary ebullition irritated my &s;en&s;es during the hours of repo&s;e, and operated of it|&s;elf, by the mere force of an excellent con&s;titution, an effect which was as perfectly unknown to me as the cau&s;e. The fir&s;t &s;entiment that re&s;ulted from it was an unaccountable &s;ort of terror. I had read in my <HI>Philot&eacute;e,</HI> that we are not permitted to derive any plea&s;ure from our bodies unle&s;s in lawful marriage. This precept recurred to my mind. What I had ex|perienced might be called a plea&s;ure: I was there|fore culpable, and in a way too that might occa&s;ion me the greate&s;t &s;hame and &s;orrow, &s;ince it was pre|ci&s;ely the offence mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ing to the Lamb without &s;pot. Great was the agitation in my poor heart, fervent were my prayers, and my mortifica|tions &s;evere! How was a &s;imilar event to be avoided in future? for after all I had not fore&s;een it. True;
<PB N="101" REF="034483_0463_0FFDC5B91C595EB8">
but I had not taken pains to prevent it, at the in&s;tant it was coming on. My vigilance accordingly became extreme. I perceived that one po&s;ition expo&s;ed me more to it than another; and carefully avoided it. My unea&s;ine&s;s was &s;o great, that it u&s;ed afterwards to wake me before the cata&s;trophe. When I had been unable to prevent it, I leaped out of bed, and &s;tand|ing in the mid&s;t of winter, with my naked feet on the bare pavement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In France the bed-rooms are generally paved with hexagonal tiles.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, I &s;upplicated the Lord, with folded arms, to pre&s;erve me from the temptations of the de|vil. I lo&s;t no time in putting my&s;elf upon low diet; and it has happened to me to practi&s;e literally what the royal prophet has perhaps only given us, as an orien|tal figure of &s;peech; I mixed a&s;hes with my bread, and moi&s;tened it with my tears. I have made more than one breakfa&s;t on toa&s;t &s;prinkled with a&s;hes in&s;tead of &s;alt, by way of penance. The&s;e repa&s;ts did me no more harm than the nocturnal accidents, for the re|paration of which, I put my&s;elf upon &s;o &s;trange a regimen. At la&s;t I conceived that they might be trials which heaven permitted in order to keep us in humble di&s;tru&s;t of our&s;elves; and I called to mind the complaints of St. Paul, and his prayers to be delivered from '<HI>the thorn in the fle&s;h, the me&s;&s;enger of Satan that was given to buffet him.</HI>' I fancied that it was on this account, that St. Bernard u&s;ed to throw

How humble and fervent was my devo|tion whenever &s;uch an accident had happened to me! How much mu&s;t my earne&s;t voice, my humble attitude, the extraordinary glow of my complexion, and my bright and humid eyes, have added to the expre&s;&s;ion of a countenance full of candour and &s;en&s;ibility! What a mixture of innocence, of pre|mature &s;entiment, of good &s;en&s;e, and of &s;impli|city! In truth, I almo&s;t con&s;ider my&s;elf as fortu|nate in being &s;ent to pri&s;on, in order to call to mind the&s;e intere&s;ting peculiarities, which never before came into my head, and by which I am highly affected.</P>

It was in vain that the mo&s;t &s;crupulous examination quieted my con&s;cience as to my will: I always returned to the principle of the <HI>Philot&eacute;e,</HI> and the argument thence to be inferred; and, in &s;hort, if it were only a trial, it ought &s;till to be laid before my confe&s;&s;or. How &s;hall I attempt it? What name &s;hall I give it? What &s;hall I de|&s;cribe? or how expre&s;s my&s;elf?&mdash;'Father, I accu&s;e my&s;elf.'&mdash;'Well, child!' What could I &s;ay next?

My heart began to beat, the blood ru&s;hed into my face, and a dewy moi&s;ture diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over my whole frame. 'I accu&s;e my&s;elf&mdash;of having had emo|tions contrary to the cha&s;tity of a chri&s;tian.' Oh! what an excellent phra&s;e! Santeuil was not more delighted at finding his rhime, nor Archimedes with the &s;olution of his problem, than I was plea&s;ed with the expre&s;&s;ion. But if he &s;hould que&s;tion me fur|ther? Nay, but I have told all I can; it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to know the re&s;t. I trembled that day much more than u&s;ual in kneeling before the holy tribunal; and my veil was pulled down to my chin. I was anxious, however, to ea&s;e my heart of the heavie&s;t of my accu&s;ations. 'Have you at all contributed thereto?'&mdash; 'I do not know, but my will was not concerned.' &mdash;'Have you read no bad books?'&mdash;'Never.'&mdash; 'Entertained no improper thoughts?'&mdash;'Oh no! I abhor them.'&mdash;'Hem! go on.' I know not whether the Abb&eacute; Morel had any bad thoughts to combat at that moment, but his prudent re&s;erve not &s;uffering him to add any thing more, I looked upon his <HI>Hem! Go on,</HI> as tantamount to the order of the day, and concluded, that I was not &s;o criminal as I had &s;uppo&s;ed. He took care, however, in his final exhortation, to recommend to me to be watch|ful, and to remind me, that angelic purity was the virtue mo&s;t agreeable in the eyes of the Lord, with other common-place maxims which I read every day. I was confirmed in my idea that it was a trial, and
<PB N="104" REF="034483_0466_0FFDECF918E81D28">
that I was right in my applications of St. Paul and other holy writers. My con&s;cience w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> delivered from a very painful &s;cruple, and I became in future free from agitation. It is inconceivable what good effects this habit of re&s;traint has produced on the whole cour&s;e of my life, notwith&s;tanding the way in which it was contracted. It has gained &s;uch an a&s;cendance over me, that I have maintained, from delicacy and a &s;en&s;e of rectitude, the &s;everity that fir&s;t &s;prung from devotion. I became mi&s;tre&s;s of my imagina|tion by dint of curbing it; I took a &s;ort of di&s;like to every brutal and &s;olitary gratification; and in dan|gerous &s;ituations have found a plea&s;ure in remain|ing prudent, when &s;eduction would have led me to forget my rea&s;on and my principles. Plea&s;ure, like happine&s;s, I can &s;ee only in the union of what charms the heart as well as the &s;en&s;es, and leaves behind it no regret. With &s;uch &s;entiments, it is difficult to forget, and impo&s;&s;ible to degrade, one's &s;elf, at the &s;ame time that they do not exempt us from what is properly called a tender pa&s;&s;ion; on the contrary, they perhaps increa&s;e the quantity of fuel by which it is fed. I might add here, as in geometry, Q. E. D. But have a little patience! we have plenty of time to come at the proof.</P>
<P>TO the newly acquired &s;en&s;ations of a well orga|nized frame, were in&s;en&s;ibly joined all the modifi|cations of the de&s;ire to plea&s;e. I was fond of <HI>look|ing well,</HI> I was plea&s;ed at hearing it &s;aid, and wil|lingly

employed my&s;elf in whatever &s;eemed likely to procure me that &s;atisfaction. This, perhaps, is the place to draw my portrait, and it will be quite as well to in&s;ert it here as el&s;ewhere. At fourteen years old, having already attained my full height, my &s;tature was, as now, about five feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Near five feet four inches Engli&s;h mea&s;ure.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;</HI></NOTE>; my leg was well made; my foot well &s;et on; my hips high and prominent; my che&s;t broad, and nobly decorated; my &s;houlders flat; my carriage firm and graceful; and my walk light and quick:&mdash;&s;uch was the fir&s;t <HI>coup d'oeil.</HI> My face had nothing &s;triking in it, except a great deal of colour, and much &s;oftne&s;s and expre&s;&s;ion. On examining each feature, 'Where,' it might be &s;aid, 'is the beauty?' Not a &s;ingle one is regular, and yet all plea&s;e. My mouth is a little wide; you may &s;ee prettier every day; but you will &s;ee none with a &s;mile more ten|der or engaging. My eyes, on the contrary, are not very large, and the colour of the iris is hazel; but they are &s;ufficiently prominent, and are crown|ed with well-arched eye brows, which, like my hair, are of a dark brown. My look is open, frank, lively, and tender, varying in its expre&s;&s;ion like the affectionate heart of which it indicates the movements; &s;erious and lofty, it &s;ometimes a&s;to|ni&s;hes; but it charms much more, and never fails to keep attention awake. My no&s;e gave me &s;ome un|ea&s;ine&s;s;

I thought it a little too full at the end: but taken with the re&s;t, e&s;pecially in profile, its effect is not ami&s;s. My forehead, broad, high, with the hair retiring, at that early age, &s;upported by a very elevated orbit of the eye, and marked by veins in the form of a Y, that dilated on the &s;lighte&s;t emo|tion, was far from making &s;uch an in&s;ignificant figure as it does in many faces. As to my chin, which turns up a little at the end, it has preci&s;ely the marks at|tributed by phy&s;iognomi&s;ts to the voluptuary. Indeed, when I combine all the peculiarities of my character, I doubt if ever an individual &s;o well formed for plea|&s;ure, ta&s;ted it &s;o little. A complexion clear rather than fair, a fre&s;h colour, frequently heightened by the &s;udden flu&s;h of a rapid circulation excited by the mo&s;t irritable nerves; a &s;mooth &s;kin, a well-turned arm, a hand, which, without being &s;mall, is elegant, becau&s;e its long and taper fingers give it grace, and indicate addre&s;s; teeth white and regular; and the plumpne&s;s of perfect health:&mdash;&s;uch are the gifts with which nature had endowed me. I have lo&s;t many of them, particularly the fulne&s;s of my form, and the bloom and ruddine&s;s of my com|plexion; but tho&s;e which remain &s;till hide five or &s;ix years of my age, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, &s;o that the per&s;ons who are in the daily habit of &s;eeing me, will hardly believe me to be more than two or three and thirty. It is only &s;ince my beauty has begun to fade, that I know what was its extent;
<PB N="107" REF="034483_0469_0FFDED013A6372E0">
while in its bloom I was uncon&s;cious of its value, which was probably augmented by my ignorance. I do not regret its lo&s;s, becau&s;e I have never abu&s;ed it; but I certainly &s;hould not be &s;orry, provided my duty could be reconciled with my inclination, to turn the portion that remains to better account. My portrait has frequently been drawn, painted, and engraved, but none of the&s;e imitations gives an idea of my per&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cameo of Langlois is the lea&s;t defective.</NOTE>: my likene&s;s is very hard to hit, becau&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul is more &s;trongly marked than the lines of my countenance. This an arti&s;t of common abilities cannot repre&s;ent; po&s;&s;ibly he does not even &s;ee it. My face takes animation in proportion to the intere&s;t with which I am in&s;pired, in the &s;ame manner as my mind is developed in propor|tion to the mind with which I communicate.

more than ca&s;t up a bill, or cut out a &s;hirt. It was not without rea&s;on that Camille De&s;moulins was a&s;toni&s;hed that '<HI>at my age, and with &s;o little beauty,</HI>' I had &s;till what he calls adorers. I never &s;poke to him in my life, but it is probable that with a per&s;onage of his &s;tamp I &s;hould be cold and &s;ilent, if not ab&s;o|lutely repul&s;ive. He was not right in &s;uppo&s;ing me to hold a court. I hate gallants as much as I de&s;pi&s;e &s;laves, and know perfectly well how to get rid of a flatterer. What I want is e&s;teem and good-will; admire me afterwards if you plea&s;e; but e&s;teem and affection I mu&s;t have at any rate: this &s;eldom fails with tho&s;e who &s;ee me often, and who po&s;&s;e&s;s, at the &s;ame time, a &s;ound under&s;tanding and a heart.</P>
<P>THAT de&s;ire to plea&s;e, which animates a youthful brea&s;t, and excites &s;o delicious an emotion when we perceive the flattering looks of which we are the object, was curiou&s;ly combined with my virgin ba&s;h|fulne&s;s, and the au&s;terity of my principles, and dif|fu&s;ed a peculiar charm over my per&s;on and my dre&s;s. Nothing could be more decent than my garb, nor any thing more mode&s;t than my deportment: though wi&s;hing them to be&s;peak re&s;erve, and a&s;|piring only to neatne&s;s, the greate&s;t commenda|tions were be&s;towed upon my ta&s;te. Meanwhile, that renunciation of the world, that contempt of its pomps and vanities, &s;o &s;trongly recommended by chri&s;tian morality, accorded ill with the &s;ugge&s;tions

of nature. Their contradictions at fir&s;t tormented me, but my rea&s;oning nece&s;&s;arily extended to rules of conduct, as well as to articles of faith. I ap|plied my&s;elf with equal attention to the inve&s;tiga|tion of what I ought to do, and the examination of what it was po&s;&s;ible for me to believe: the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, con&s;idered as the moral &s;cience, and the ba&s;is of happine&s;s, became my only one, and I referred to it all my reading and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame thing happened to me in metaphy&s;ics and morality, that I had experienced in reading poetry: I fancied my&s;elf transformed into the per|&s;onage of the drama that had mo&s;t analogy with my|&s;elf, or that I mo&s;t e&s;teemed; and adopted the pro|po&s;itions, with the novelty or brilliancy of which I had been &s;truck: they remained my own, till &s;ome newer or more profound di&s;cu&s;&s;ion came in my way. Thus, in the controver&s;ial cla&s;s, I &s;ided with the au|thors of Port Royal; their logic and their au&s;terity agreed with my temper of mind, while I felt an in|&s;tinctive aver&s;ion to the &s;ophi&s;tical, eva&s;ive, and flex|ible faith of the Je&s;uits. When I became acquainted with the ancient &s;ects of philo&s;ophers, I gave the palm to the &s;toics; and endeavoured like them, to maintain that pain was no evil. That folly could not la&s;t, but I per&s;i&s;ted in determining at lea&s;t not to be overcome by it; and my little experiments convinced me that I could endure the greate&s;t torments without uttering a cry. The night of my marriage de&s;troyed

the confidence I had till then pre&s;erved: it is true, &s;urpri&s;e had &s;ome &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and a novice of that rigid order may be expected to bear an evil fore&s;een, better than one that came unawares, when the very contrary was looked for.</P>
<P>DURING two months that I &s;tudied De&s;cartes and Malebranche, I con&s;idered my kitten, when &s;he mewed, merely as a piece of mechani&s;m perform|ing its movements; but in thus &s;eparating &s;enti|ment from its &s;igns, it &s;eemed to me that I was di&s;&s;ecting nature, and robbing it of all its charms. I thought it infinitely more agreeable to give every thing a &s;oul; and &s;hould have adopted that of Spino&s;a, rather than go without one. Helvetius hurt me; he annihilated the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing illu|&s;ions; and &s;hewed me every where a mean and re|volting &s;elf-intere&s;t: yet what &s;agacity! what happy ideas!

<P>MY mother, my amiable little uncle, Mademoi&s;elle d'Hannaches, and my&s;elf, made a journey to Ver|&s;ailles, which was &s;olely intended to &s;hew me the court, and the place it inhabited, and to amu&s;e me with its pageantry.

There is a kind of ju&s;tice due to a man's &s;elf, even were he living in the world alone: it is incumbent on him &s;o to regulate all his affections and habits, that he may be the &s;lave of none.

The tran&s;ports of my ardent &s;oul were repre&s;&s;ed by it, and I only knew the full extent of my attachment to her, by the de&s;pair and delirium that I fell into at her death. My days pa&s;&s;ed away in de|lightful tranquillity. I &s;pent the greater part in &s;oli|tary &s;tudies, tran&s;ported by my imagination to the remote ages of antiquity, of which I reviewed the hi&s;tory and the arts, and examined the precepts and opinions. Ma&s;s in the morning, a few hours that we &s;pent in reading together, our repa&s;ts and our vi&s;its made up the only portion of time that I pa&s;&s;ed in my mother's company. We went abroad but &s;eldom, and when vi&s;itors came who were not to my liking, I contrived to remain in my clo&s;et, which my mother was too kind to oblige me to quit. Sundays and holidays were devoted to our walks: &s;ometimes we extended them to a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance, and at la&s;t got into the habit of doing &s;o, in con&s;equence of the preference I gave to the country over the formal gardens of the metro|polis. I was, however, by no means in&s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;ure of appearing occa&s;ionally in the public walks. They afforded at that period, a very bril|liant &s;pectacle, in which the youth of both &s;exes always had an agreeable part to play. Per&s;onal
<PB N="126" REF="034483_0488_0FFDED3475985640">
graces con&s;tantly obtained there the homage of ad|miration, which mode&s;ty cannot but perceive, and of which the heart of a young girl is always co|vetous. But it did not &s;atisfy mine: I experienced after the&s;e walks, during which my vanity, power|fully. excited, was upon the watch for whatever could &s;hew me off to advantage, and prove to me that I had not lo&s;t my time, an in&s;upportable vacuity, an unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t, which made the plea&s;ures of vanity too dear a purcha&s;e. Accu&s;tom|ed to reflect, and to render an account of my &s;en&s;a|tions to my&s;elf, I made a &s;trict inquiry into the cau&s;e of this inquietude, and found &s;ufficient room to exerci&s;e my philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>'Is it then,' &s;aid I to my&s;elf, 'to plea&s;e the eye, like the flowers of a parterre, and to receive a few evane&s;cent prai&s;es, that per&s;ons of my &s;ex are brought up in the practice of virtue, and enriched with talents?

What are to me the ad|miring eyes, and &s;oftly murmured compliments, of a crowd, of which I have no knowledge, and which is compo&s;ed of per&s;ons, whom, did I know them, I &s;hould probably de&s;pi&s;e? Did I come into the world to wa&s;te my exi&s;tence in frivolous cares and tumultuous &s;en&s;ations?&mdash;No: I have doubtle&s;s a nobler de&s;tination! The admiration which I

&s;o ardently feel for whatever is virtuous, wi&s;e, exalted, and generous, tells me that I am called to practi&s;e the&s;e things. The &s;ublime and rapturous duties of a wife and a mother will on &s;ome future day be mine; it is in rendering my&s;elf capable of fulfilling them, that my early years ought to be employed; I ought to &s;tudy their importance, and to learn, by keeping my own inclinations within bounds, how to direct here|after tho&s;e of my children; by the habit of governing my pa&s;&s;ions, and by the care of cultivating my mind, I ought to &s;ecure to my&s;elf the means of giving happi|ne&s;s to the mo&s;t delightful of &s;ocieties, of providing a never-failing &s;ource of felicity for the man who &s;hall de&s;erve my heart, and of communicating to all about us, a portion of the bli&s;s with which I &s;hall crown his wi&s;hes, and which ought to be the entire work of my own hands.'</P>
<P>SUCH were the thoughts that agitated my bo&s;om. Overcome with emotion, I &s;hed a flood of tears, while my heart exalted it&s;elf to that &s;upreme intelligence, that fir&s;t cau&s;e, that gracious providence, that prin|ciple of thought and of &s;entiment, which it felt the nece&s;&s;ity of believing and acknowledging. 'O thou who ha&s;t placed me on the earth, enable me to fulfil my de&s;tination in the manner mo&s;t comformable to thy divine will, and mo&s;t beneficial to the welfare of my fellow-creatures.'</P>
<P>THIS unaffected prayer, as &s;imple as the heart that dictated it, is become my only one; never have

the doubts of philo&s;ophy, nor any &s;pecies of di&s;&s;ipa|tion, been able to dry up its &s;ource. In the mid&s;t of the tumult of the world, and in the depth of a dun|geon, I have pronounced it with equal fervour. I pronounced it with tran&s;port in the mo&s;t brilliant cir|cum&s;tances of my life; I repeat it in fetters with re|&s;ignation; anxious in the former to guard again&s;t every affection unworthy of my &s;ituation; careful in the latter to pre&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary fortitude for &s;up|porting me in the trials to which I am expo&s;ed; per|&s;uaded that, in the cour&s;e of things, there are events which human wi&s;dom cannot prevent; and convinced that the mo&s;t calamitous ones cannot overpower a firm mind; and that peace at home, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to nece&s;&s;ity, are the elements of happine&s;s, and con|&s;titute the true independence of the &s;age and of the hero.</P>
<P>THE country pre&s;ented objects more analogous to my habits of meditation, to my &s;erious, tender and pen&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition, fortified by reflection and the developement of a feeling heart. We often went to Meudon: it was my favourite walk. I preferred its wild woods, its &s;olitary ponds, its avenues of pines, and its towering trees, to the frequented paths and uni|form coppices of the <HI>Bois de Boulogne,</HI> to the orna|mented gardens of Belle-vue, or the clipt and right|lined vi&s;tas of St. Cloud.&mdash;'Where &s;hall we go to|morrow, if the weather be fine? &s;aid my father on the Saturday evenings during &s;ummer&mdash;He then look|ed

at me with a &s;mile&mdash;'&s;hall we go to St. Cloud? the water-works are to play: there will be a world of company.'&mdash;'Ah, papa! if you would go to Meu|don I &s;hould be much better plea&s;ed.' By five o'clock on Sunday morning every body was &s;tirring; a light, neat, and &s;imple dre&s;s, a few flowers, and a gauze veil, announced the project of the day. The odes of Rou&s;&s;eau, a volume of Corneille, or of &s;ome other author, were the only baggage I took with me. We &s;et off all three, and embarked at the Pont-Royal, which I could &s;ee from my window, on board of a little boat, that, in the &s;ilence of a &s;mooth and rapid navigation, conducted us to the &s;hores of Belle-vue, not far from the gla&s;s-hou&s;e, of which the black co|lumn of &s;moke is vi&s;ible at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. Thence by a &s;teep a&s;cent we proceeded to the avenue of Meudon, about the middle of which &s;tood a little cottage on the right, that became one of our re&s;ting places. It was the abode of a milk-woman, a widow, who lived there, having two cows and &s;ome poultry. As it was advi&s;eable to make the mo&s;t of day-light for our excur&s;ion, it was agreed it &s;hould &s;erve us as a halting-place on our return, and that the good woman &s;hould furni&s;h us with a bowl of milk from the cow. That was &s;o regular a thing, that in walking up the avenue we never failed to call at the milk-woman's to tell her we &s;hould be with her in the evening or the next morning, and, not to for|get the bowl of milk. The good woman received
<PB N="130" REF="034483_0492_0FFDED3F9F525F20">
us with much kindne&s;s; and our repa&s;t, &s;ea&s;oned with a little brown bread and a great deal of good humour, had the appearance of a little fea&s;t, of which &s;ome memorial was &s;ure to remain in the milk-woman's pocket. We took our dinner at the lodge of one of the porters belonging to the park: but the de&s;ire I had of &s;triking into a &s;olitary path led us to the di&s;covery of a retreat very much to my ta&s;te. One day, after having wandered a long time in an unfrequented part of the wood, we came to an open and &s;olitary &s;pot, at the end of an avenue of lofty trees, under which a pa&s;&s;enger was &s;eldom &s;een. A few other trees &s;cattered over a charming lawn &s;erved to ma&s;k a neat little cottage two &s;tories high. '<HI>Ah!</HI> what have we here?'&mdash;Two fine children were play|ing before the door, which was &s;tanding wide open. They had neither the appearance of children of the town, nor tho&s;e en&s;igns of wretchedne&s;s &s;o com|mon in the country. We drew near; and perceived upon the left a kitchen garden, where an old man was at work. To walk in, and enter into conver&s;ation with him, was the bu&s;ine&s;s of a moment. We learned that the name of the place was <HI>Ville-bonne;</HI> that its inhabitant was the water-baliff of the <HI>Mou|lin Rouge,</HI> who&s;e office it was to &s;ee that the ca|nals conveying water to different parts of the park were kept in repair; that the &s;lender &s;alary of that place helped to &s;upport a young couple, the parents of the children whom he had &s;een, and of
<PB N="131" REF="034483_0493_0FFDED428AED8BE0">
whom the old man was the grandfather; and that the wife employed her&s;elf in the cares of the hou&s;ehold, while he cultivated the garden, the produce of which, the &s;on carried to town to &s;ell at his lei&s;ure. The gar|den was a long &s;quare, divided into four parts, round each of which was a walk of &s;ufficient width; in the centre a ba&s;on of water, which facilitated the bu&s;ine&s;s of watering; and at the farther end an arbour of yews inclo&s;ing a &s;tone bench, affording at once both &s;helter and repo&s;e. Flowers inter&s;per&s;ed among the culinary herbs gave the garden a gay and agreeable appearance; while the robu&s;t and contented gardener, who conver&s;ed with equal good humour and good &s;en&s;e, reminded me of the old man of the banks of the Gale&s;us, whom Virgil has &s;ung. A ta&s;te for &s;implicity would alone have made &s;uch an encoun|ter ageeable; but my fancy did not fail to inve&s;t it with a thou&s;and imaginary charms. We a&s;ked whether they were in the habit of affording entertainment to &s;trangers?&mdash;'Very few come here,' &s;aid the old man; 'the place is little known; but when they do, we wil|lingly &s;erve up to them the produce of our farm-yard and our garden. We begged to have &s;omething for dinner, and were furni&s;hed with new-laid eggs, vege|tables, and a &s;alad, in a delightful arbour of honey|&s;uckle behind the hou&s;e. I never made &s;o agreeable a repa&s;t: my heart dilated in contemplating the tranquillity and innocence of &s;o charming a &s;itua|tion. I fondled the little children, and expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="132" REF="034483_0494_0FFDED4536F32B50">
great veneration for the old man. The young woman &s;eemed delighted at having us in the hou&s;e. We were told that they had two rooms which they &s;hould have no objection to let to any body that would take them for three months, and we had &s;ome idea of taking them. But that agreeable project was never realized; nor have I ever been at Ville-bonne &s;ince; for Meudon had been our place of re&s;ort long before we made that di&s;covery, and we had fixed upon a little inn in the village for our lodging whenever two holydays coming together permitted us to pro|long our ab&s;ence. It was at that inn, the &s;ign of which I think was the Queen of France, we met with a laughable adventure. We were put into a room with two beds, in the large&s;t of which I &s;lept with my mother; the other in a corner &s;erved for my father alone. One night, ju&s;t after he had got into bed, the fancy took him of drawing his cur|tains perfectly clo&s;e, and he pulled them &s;o &s;trongly that the te&s;ter fell upon him and covered him up completely. After a moment of alarm, we all began to laugh very heartily at the accident; the te&s;ter having fallen exactly in &s;uch a way as to inclo&s;e my father without hurting him. We call|ed for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;et him at liberty; the good woman of the hou&s;e came; was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee her bed decapitated; and exclaimed, with the ut|mo&s;t &s;implicity, 'My God! how could this happen? it is &s;eventeen years &s;ince the bed was put up; and
<PB N="133" REF="034483_0495_0FFDED4912486F68">
in all that time it has never budged an inch.' The logic of the ho&s;te&s;s made me laugh more than the fall of the te&s;ter. I often found an occa&s;ion to ap|ply it, or rather to compare it with the arguments I heard in company; and u&s;ed to &s;ay to my mother in a whi&s;per, This is quite as good as the &s;eventeen years to prove that the bed ought not to have given way.</P>
<P>DELIGHTFUL Meudon! how often beneath thy re|fre&s;hing &s;hade have I ble&s;&s;ed the great Author of my exi&s;tence, de&s;iring what might at &s;ome future time render it complete: but it was that charming &s;enti|ment of de&s;ire without impatience, which only &s;erves to gild the clouds of futurity with the rays of hope. How often in thy cool retreats have I gathered the variegated fern, and the brilliant flowers of the orchis! How did I love to re&s;t my&s;elf under the lofty trees bordering the glades, through which I u&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;wift and timorous doe go bounding along! I recollect the more <HI>&s;ombre</HI> &s;pots, whither we retired during the heat of the day. There, while my father, &s;tretched upon the green&s;ward, and my mother, &s;oftly reclined on a heap of leaves which I had collected for the purpo&s;e, enjoyed their afternoon's nap, did I contemplate the maje&s;ty of thy &s;ilent groves, admire the beauty of nature, and adore the Providence who&s;e benefits I felt! The glow of &s;entiment heightened the colour of my humid cheeks, and my heart enjoyed all the delight of the
<PB N="134" REF="034483_0496_0FFDED4A9F3C5A68">
terre&s;trial paradi&s;e. An account of my excur&s;ions, and of the plea&s;ure they afforded me, found its way into my corre&s;pondence with Sophia: &s;ometimes my pro&s;e was intermingled with ver&s;e, the irregular, but ea&s;y, and &s;ometimes happy effu&s;ions of a mind to which all was picture, life, and felicity.</P>
<P>SOPHIA, as I have already ob&s;erved, found her|&s;elf thrown into a &s;ociety, where &s;he had none of the comforts which &s;he knew me to enjoy in my &s;oli|tude. I was acquainted with &s;everal of her family, and learned from their company to rate my retirement at a higher price.</P>
<P>IN her journies to Paris with her mother &s;he u&s;ed to alight at the hou&s;e of two cou&s;ins, who&s;e names were <HI>De Lamotte.</HI> They were old maidens, one of whom, a &s;our devotee, never &s;tirred from her cham|ber, where &s;he &s;aid her prayers, &s;colded the &s;ervants, knitted &s;tockings, and rea&s;oned with tolerable acute|ne&s;s about her per&s;onal intere&s;ts: the other, a good &s;ort of woman, &s;at in the parlour, did the honours of the hou&s;e, read the p&s;alms, and took a hand of cards. Both of them were very proud of their noble birth, and could &s;carcely conceive it po&s;&s;ible to keep compa|ny with per&s;ons who&s;e father at lea&s;t had not been ennobled; and, without daring to wear it, carefully pre&s;erved the <HI>&s;ack</HI> of which their mother had had the train borne after her to church, as a mark of family con&s;equence. They had taken under their care a young woman, their relation, who&s;e &s;lender fortune
<PB N="135" REF="034483_0497_0FFDED4D80BCC438">
they purpo&s;ed augmenting, provided &s;he could find a gentleman to marry her. The young woman, Mademoi&s;elle <HI>d'Hangard,</HI> was a tall, lu&s;ty brunette, of a ruddy complexion, and enjoying a &s;tate of health &s;o vigorous as almo&s;t to alarm, who&s;e ru&s;ticity of ap|pearance ill concealed a petulant temper and a narrow mind. But the mo&s;t curious piece of hou&s;ehold goods was coun&s;ellor <HI>Perdu,</HI> a widower, who had con&s;umed his e&s;tate in doing nothing, and who had been put to board with his cou&s;ins by his &s;i&s;ter (my Sophia's mo|ther,) that he might pa&s;s the la&s;t years of his worth|le&s;s exi&s;tence in a decent way. Mr. Perdu, who was wonderfully plump and &s;leek, devoted the greater part of the morning to the care of his per&s;on, dined with an excellent appetite while cur&s;ing the di&s;hes, and pa&s;&s;ed in di&s;&s;ertations at the Luxembourg<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A public garden at Paris.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, &s;everal hours of every day, which was &s;ure to clo&s;e with a game of piquet. He was &s;till prouder of his gentility than his old cou&s;ins, and piqued him&s;elf upon having all the airs and principles of a man of noble birth. When &s;peaking to Sophia of her uncle, I always called him <HI>the commandant,</HI> &s;o &s;trongly did he re&s;emble <HI>the commandant</HI> in Cre|billion's <HI>P&egrave;re de Famille.</HI> The <HI>commandant</HI> then al|ways a&s;&s;umed a great air of &s;uperiority with his nieces, affecting to temper it with the conde&s;cen|&s;ions of politene&s;s; but there was &s;omething whim&s;ical

in his behaviour to Mademoi&s;elle d'Hangard, who&s;e fre&s;h complexion and continual pre&s;ence, inflaming his imagination, in&s;pired him with &s;en&s;ations which he dared not betray, and which &s;ometimes put him out of humour with his nephew.</P>
<P>THE nephew, who took the name of <HI>Selincour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In France it is cu&s;tomary for the &s;ons to a&s;&s;ume the names of the different e&s;tates, and &s;ometimes &s;uch as are merely dictated by fancy.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, was a tall young man, with a gentle look and a &s;oft voice, not unlike his &s;i&s;ter Sophia, &s;en&s;ible in his conver&s;ation, and agreeable in his manners, to which a &s;ort of ba&s;h|fulne&s;s was no di&s;advantage; &s;uch at lea&s;t was my opinion, even when it became more than u&s;ually per|ceptible in his intercour&s;e with me. Probabilities, and the wi&s;hes of the family, appeared to point him out as a proper &s;uitor for Mademoi&s;elle d'Han|gard.</P>
<P>As to Me&s;demoi&s;elles Lamotte's &s;ociety, it was compo&s;ed of a <HI>Count d'E&s;&s;ales,</HI> created a Chevalier of St. Louis in Canada, where he had married the governor's daughter; taking care to keep at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance from great guns, ignorant, overbearing, and garrulous, he came to play a party of piquet with the Marchione&s;s de <HI>Cailiaville,</HI> an antiquated dowager, with whom he had more than one game going on, which the good old dam|&s;els did not perceive.

had quitted the parliament of Brittany after the affair of la Chalotais, u&s;ed to come al&s;o, but le&s;s fre|quently, with her two daughters, the one a &s;cholar, the other a devotee. The tender heart of the latter would have gained my affection; but her wry neck &s;upported with difficulty a head &s;o crammed with reli|gion, that there was no room for any thing like rea|&s;on. The &s;cholar, with rather too much loquacity, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of judgment and ta&s;te enough ju&s;t to render a repul&s;ive figure &s;upportable. But <HI>M. de Vouglans</HI> &s;oared above them all. A delineation of his character would be &s;uperfluous to tho&s;e who have read the book entitled <HI>Rea&s;ons for my Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by a Magi&s;trate,</HI> and his <HI>Collection of Penal Laws,</HI> an elaborate compilation, in which equal indu&s;try, fana|tici&s;m, and atrocity were di&s;played. I never met with a man by who&s;e &s;anguinary intolerance I was &s;o much &s;hocked. He took particular plea&s;ure in con|ver&s;ing with father Romain Joly, a little old monk, Me&s;demoi&s;elles Lamotte's confe&s;&s;or, who made ver&s;es again&s;t Voltaire, in which he compared him to the devil, and who was for ever quoting in the pulpit the <HI>Capitularies</HI> of Charlemagne, and the edicts of our monarchs. I have had the good fortune to dine with him at the table of the Lamottes, to hear him preach at my own pari&s;h church, and to read his <HI>Phaeton</HI>; and he would afford me an excellent caricature, if I had courage enough to &s;hake folly, hypocri&s;y, and the mo&s;t puerile learning, out of his gown. So|phia's

friend made a curious figure in this &s;ociety, of which the members lamented when her back was turn|ed, that &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed a young woman was not of noble birth. I do not even doubt but that the com|mandant had, in his great wi&s;dom, deliberated whe|ther &s;uch a connexion were proper for his niece. But <HI>the young woman</HI> was well bred, and behaved with a decorum which the old maids highly approved; and unle&s;s when expre&s;&s;ions e&s;caped her, which <HI>&s;avoured of wit,</HI> and which he was &s;ure to animadvert upon to his nieces, the <HI>commandant</HI> him&s;elf could not altoge|ther withhold his prai&s;e. He would even take charge of Sophia's letters, and bring them to my mother's; a thing that Selincour would have done more readily, if his &s;i&s;ter had con&s;ented to entru&s;t them to his care.</P>
<P>THE in&s;ignificance and oddities of the&s;e per&s;on|ages, to whom, no doubt, many people of the great world bore a re&s;emblance, made me reflect on the inanity of fa&s;hionable circles, and the advantage of not being obliged to frequent them. Sophia enume|rated all the per&s;ons with whom &s;he a&s;&s;ociated at Amiens, and gave me a &s;ketch of their characters, which enabled me to judge of the in&s;ignificance of mo&s;t of them; &s;o that when the balance was &s;truck, it appeared that, at the end of the year, I had &s;een in my &s;olitude more people of merit, than &s;he had per|ceived in her round of routs and a&s;&s;emblies. This may ea&s;ily be conceived, when it is remembered that my

father's bu&s;ine&s;s connected him with none but arti&s;ts, many of whom came occa&s;ionally to the hou&s;e, though none were regular vi&s;itors. Tho&s;e who inhabit the capital, even, if not of the fir&s;t rank, acquire a fund of information, and a kind of urbanity, which mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly is neither to be found among the little provincial gentry, nor among mercantile people in ha&s;te to make a fortune that may &s;erve as the means of ennobling their family.

<P>THERE is no doubt that our &s;ituation in life has a con&s;iderable influence on our characters and opi|nions: but, in the education I received, in the ideas I acquired, whether by &s;tudy or by ob&s;ervation of the world, every thing may be &s;aid to have concurred in in&s;piring me with republican enthu&s;ia&s;m, by making me perceive the folly, or feel the inju&s;tice, of a mul|titude of privileges and di&s;tinctions. Accordingly, in all my readings, I took the &s;ide of the champions of equality; I was Agis and Cleomenes at Sparta; the Gracchi at Rome; and, like Cornelia, I &s;hould have reproached my &s;ons with being called nothing but the mother-in-law of Scipio. I retired with the plebeians to the Aventine hill; and gave my vote to the tribunes. Now that experience has taught me to appreciate every thing with impartiality, I &s;ee in the enterpri&s;e of the Gracchi, and in the conduct of the tribunes, crimes and mi&s;chiefs, of which I was not at that time &s;ufficiently aware.</P>

The di&s;&s;olute conduct of the court during the la&s;t years of Lewis XV. that contempt of morality, which pervaded all ranks of the nation, and tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es, which were the &s;ubject of all private conver&s;ation, filled me with a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation.

I attached my&s;elf to tho&s;e neighbours; the work of De Lolme had familiar|i&s;ed me with their con&s;titution; I &s;ought an ac|quaintance with their writers, and &s;tudied their li|terature, but as yet only through the medium of tran&s;lations.</P>

the di&s;order, for I had already too much philo&s;ophy not to &s;upport &s;uch a trial with fortitude; but from my mother's incredible and affecting &s;olicitude. What &s;orrow, and yet what activity! In what agitation was &s;he kept by her unea&s;ine&s;s! and what tenderne&s;s was di&s;played in all her attentions! Even during the night, when I thought I was taking &s;omething from the nur&s;e, I felt my mother's hand, and heard her voice while getting out of her bed every moment to come to the &s;ide of mine; her anxious eyes devoured the looks, and, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, the words of my phy&s;ician; and in &s;pite of her re&s;olution to &s;uppre&s;s them, the tears &s;tole from her eyes, when looking at me, while I endeavoured, in vain, by a cheerful a&s;pect, to pacify her feelings. Neither &s;he nor my father had ever had the &s;mall-pox, and yet neither of them would &s;uffer a day to pa&s;s without ki&s;&s;ing the di&s;|figured cheek, which I &s;trove in vain to keep out of their way, for fear the contact &s;hould be followed by fatal effects.

without our meeting; but Selincour called every day on the part of his mother to inquire after my health; and I heard from my chamber his mourn|ful exclamation when he was told, that a complica|tion of the putrid fever and &s;mall-pox was feared. I had the miliary fever; the eruption peculiar to which, checking the other, the pu&s;tules of &s;mall-pox were few, and though large, &s;ub&s;ided without &s;up|puration, and left only a dry &s;kin, that fell off of it|&s;elf. It is the kind of &s;mall-pox, &s;aid Dr. Mi&s;&s;a, that the Italians call <HI>ravaglaoni,</HI> pu&s;tules of fal&s;e &s;uppuration, which leave no ve&s;tiges behind; and in reality not even the poli&s;h of the &s;kin was im|paired: but the ravages made by the variolous hu|mour threw me into a &s;tate of languor and debility, from which it was four or five months before I was completely recovered. Sedate in health, too ten|der to be gay, but patient under affliction, my &s;ole object in &s;ickne&s;s is to divert my attention from my &s;ufferings, and to render agreeable the trouble&s;ome attentions I require from tho&s;e about me.

<P>Doctor Mi&s;&s;a was a &s;en&s;ible man, whom I was very much plea&s;ed with. As he was &s;ufficiently advanced in years to relieve me from the con&s;traint that I was kept in by younger men, we conver&s;ed freely in his vi&s;its, which we willingly prolonged;

and conceived a friend&s;hip for each other. One or other of us, &s;aid he, one day, has been much in the wrong. Either I am come too &s;oon, or you too late. Though Mi&s;&s;a's good &s;en&s;e had di&s;po&s;ed me favourably towards him, his age had prevented me from perceiving that I had been in the wrong to come later than he: I made him no other an&s;wer than a &s;mile. He was bringing up nieces, with whom he wi&s;hed me to be acquainted, and we &s;ometimes vi&s;it|ed; but as the never went out without their gover|ne&s;s, any more than I without my mother, and as the uncle's profe&s;&s;ion did not leave him lei&s;ure to keep up the connexion between us, it came to nothing in con&s;equence of our di&s;tant abodes and &s;edentary ha|bits.

<P>AN excur&s;ion to the country being nece&s;&s;ary for the perfect re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my health, we went to breathe its &s;alutary air at the hou&s;e of M. and Madam Be&s;nard, with whom two years before my mother and I had &s;pent almo&s;t the whole month of September. Their &s;ituation was admirably calculated to feed my philo&s;ophy, and to fix my meditations up|on the vices of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>MADAM Be&s;nard, upon the rever&s;e of fortune which
<PB N="146" REF="034483_0508_0FFDED6B08B51488">
&s;he had experienced in common with her &s;i&s;ters, had entered into the family of a <HI>fermier-general,</HI> who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he &s;uperintended: it was that of old Haudry. There &s;he had married the &s;teward, M. Be&s;nard, with whom &s;he had long &s;ince retired from the world, and was living in peace and happine&s;s, though in an hum|ble way.</P>
<P>THE ill-placed pride of Madam Phlipon had led her &s;ometimes to expre&s;s, in my pre&s;ence, and in the privacy of the family, how much this marriage had di&s;plea&s;ed her; but, as far as I can judge, &s;he was certainly offended without cau&s;e. M. Be&s;nard was a man of integrity and good moral character, each of which was the more prai&s;e-worthy in pro|portion as it was difficult to meet with among men in the &s;ame line of life. The whole of his conduct to his wife exhibited the greate&s;t delicacy of &s;en|timent. It is impo&s;&s;ible to carry veneration, ten|derne&s;s, and attachment, to a greater length. En|joying the &s;weets of a perfect union, they &s;till pro|long a career, in which, like Baucis and Philemon, they attract the re&s;pect of all who witne&s;s their &s;im|plicity of life, and their virtues. I e&s;teem it an hon|our to be related to them; and &s;hould do &s;o &s;till, if with the &s;ame character and conduct, M. Be&s;nard had been a footman.</P>
<P>OLD Haudry, who owed his fortune to his own exertions, was dead; and had left a large fortune to a &s;on, who, being born in opulence, was likely to
<PB N="147" REF="034483_0509_0FFDED6DB4975160">
&s;quander it away. That &s;on, who had already lo&s;t a charming wife, lived at a great expence; and, according to the cu&s;tom of the rich, &s;pent a &s;mall part of the year at the chateau of Soucy, whither he was much more apt to carry the manners of the town, than to adopt tho&s;e that were &s;uitable to the country. He had &s;everal contiguous e&s;tates, of which that neare&s;t to Soucy (Fontenay) had an old man&s;ion belonging to it that he was fond of filling with inha|bitants. He had given a lodging there to a notary and an over&s;eer, and reque&s;ted M. Be&s;nard to take an apartment, which might &s;erve him as a re&s;idence during part of the &s;ummer. This was no bad way of keeping his e&s;tate in good order, at the &s;ame time that it gave him an air of magnificence. M. and Ma|dam Be&s;nard were well accommodated, and enjoyed the plea&s;ure of walking in a park, the wildne&s;s of which made an agreeable contra&s;t with the gardens of Soucy, and plea&s;ed me more than the luxury that di&s;tingui&s;hed the <HI>farmer-general's</HI> abode. As &s;oon as we arrived at Madam Be&s;nards, &s;he reque&s;ted us to go and pay a vi&s;it to Soucy, where Haudry's &s;i&s;ter-in-law and &s;tep-mother re&s;ided with him, and did the honours of his hou&s;e. The vi&s;it was mode&s;tly paid before din|ner. I walked without the &s;malle&s;t plea&s;urable &s;en&s;a|tion into the drawing-room, where Madam Penault and her daughter received us with great politene&s;s, it is true, but it was a politene&s;s that favoured a little of &s;uperiority. My mother's manner however, and
<PB N="148" REF="034483_0510_0FFDED706A919540">
&s;omething which appeared in me al&s;o in &s;pite of that timidity which proceeds from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our worth, and a doubt of its being perceived by others, &s;carcely allowed them to a&s;&s;ume any con&s;equence. I received compliments which gave me little plea&s;ure, and which I was an&s;wering with &s;ome degree of inge|nuity, when certain para&s;ites, of the order of St. Lewis, who always haunt the man&s;ions of opu|lence, as gho&s;ts re&s;ort to the banks of the Ache|ron, thought proper to interrupt me with exaggerat|ed prai&s;e.</P>
<P>THE ladies did not fail, a few days after, to re|turn our vi&s;it. They were attended by the company that happened to be at the chateau, the vi&s;it to Fon|tenay &s;erving them for a walk. Upon that occa&s;ion, I was more engaging than before, and contrived to put into my &s;hare of the reception, &s;uch a portion of mo|de&s;t and dignified politene&s;s, as re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the equi|librium between us. It once happened to us to be in|vited to dinner by Madam Penault; but never was a&s;toni&s;hment equal to mine, when I learned that we were not to dine at her table, but with the upper &s;er|vants in the hall. I was &s;en&s;ible however, that, as M. Be&s;nard had formerly played a part there, I ought not, out of re&s;pect to him, to appear di&s;&s;atis|fied at appearing in &s;uch a character; but I was of opinion that Madam Penault might have ordered things otherwi&s;e, and have &s;pared us the contemptu|ous civility. My great aunt &s;aw it in the &s;ame light;
<PB N="149" REF="034483_0511_0FFDED75CD340CF8">
but, to avoid giving offence, we accepted the invita|tion. It was &s;omething new to me to mix with tho&s;e deities of the &s;econd order; nor had I the lea&s;t idea of what chambermaids were when giving them&s;elves airs of con&s;equence. They were pre|pared to receive us; and, indeed, played the doubles of their &s;uperiors admirably well. Dre&s;s, ge&s;ture, affectation, graces, nothing was forgotten. Their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es ca&s;t-off cloths, which were hardly &s;oiled, gave a richne&s;s to their appearance, that decent per&s;ons in trade would have thought out of character. The caricature of fa&s;hionable manners &s;uperadded a &s;ort of elegance, not le&s;s foreign to mercantile &s;implicity than to the ta&s;te of an arti&s;t, though there is no doubt but their flippancy of &s;peech, and finery, might have impo&s;ed on country ladies. It was &s;till wor&s;e with the men. The &s;word of Mr. &s;teward, the attentions of Mr. cook, and the politene&s;s and gaudy clothes of the valet-de-chambre, could not atone for the awkwardne&s;s of their manners and the blunders in their language, when they wi&s;hed it to be elegant, nor the vulgarity of their expre&s;&s;ions when they forgot their parts. The conver&s;ation was full of marqui&s;es, counts, and financiers, who&s;e ti|tles, fortunes, and alliances, &s;eemed to confer gran|deur, riches, and importance upon tho&s;e who were talking of them. The &s;uperfluities of the fir&s;t table were &s;pread upon the &s;econd with a neatne&s;s and order which gave them the air of a fir&s;t appear|ance,
<PB N="150" REF="034483_0512_0FFDED744177CB20">
and in &s;uch abundance as afterwards to &s;uffice for the third table, that of the <HI>dome&s;tics,</HI> properly &s;o called for the per&s;ons who &s;at at the &s;econd were called <HI>officers.</HI> Play followed the repa&s;t: the &s;take was high; it was what the <HI>ladies</HI> were ac|cu&s;tomed to play for, and they played every day. &mdash;I was introduced to a new world, in which were exhibited the prejudices, the vices, and the follies of a world, very little better, in &s;pite of its greater &s;how. I had heard a thou&s;and times of the origin of old Haudry, who came to Paris from his village; found means to rake thou&s;ands together at the expence of the public; married his daughter to Montul&eacute;, and his grand-daughters to the Marquis Duchillau and Count Turpin, and left his &s;on heir to an immen&s;e e&s;tate. I recollected Monte&s;quieu's expre&s;|&s;ion, who &s;ays, financiers &s;upport the &s;tate as the cord &s;upports the criminal; nor could I help thinking that tax-gatherers who contrive to ama&s;s &s;uch enormous &s;ums, and then to make their opulence &s;erve as the means of an alliance with families, which the policy of courts affects to con&s;ider as nece&s;&s;ary to a king|dom's &s;plendour and defence, mu&s;t needs belong to a dete&s;table government, and to a nation highly corrupt.&mdash;I little thought there was a govern|ment, &s;till more horrible, and a degree of corruption &s;till more to be deplored. Who, indeed, could have imagined it? All the philo&s;ophers of the age have
<PB N="151" REF="034483_0513_0FFDED7891740C50">
been deceived as well as I.&mdash;I allude to the govern|ment and corruption of the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>EVERY Sunday there was a dance at Soucy in the open air, under no other &s;helter than the trees. Gaiety, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, obliterated di&s;|tinctions in a great degree; and as &s;oon as per&s;onal merit was attended to, I had little fear of mi&s;&s;ing the place that might chance to &s;uit me be&s;t. The new comers u&s;ed to a&s;k, in a whi&s;per, who I was, but I took care to give nobody a &s;urfeit of my company; and, after an hour's recreation, withdrew with my relations for a walk, of which I would not have exchanged the tranquil enjoyments for all the empty and noi&s;y plea&s;ures that attend any kind of parade.</P>
<P>I &s;ometimes &s;aw Haudry, who was then young, acting the great man, gratifying all his fancies and wi&s;hing to appear generous and noble. His family began to be unea&s;y at his extravagance with the courtezan La Guerre, by which he was already lay|ing the foundation of his future ruin. He was pitied as imprudent, rather than blamed as vicious; he was a &s;poiled child of fortune, who, had he been born in moderate circum&s;tances. would certainly have turn|ed out a better man. With a dark complexion, an erect carriage, the airs of a great man, and courteous manners, he was perhaps amiable among tho&s;e whom he e&s;teemed his equals; but I hated to come in his
<PB N="152" REF="034483_0514_0FFDED7B40892178">
way, and never failed, when in his pre&s;ence to a&s;&s;ume an air of dignified re&s;erve.</P>
<P>LAST year, coming out of that magnificent dining-room which the elegant Calonne had fitted up in the controller-general's hotel, &s;ince occupied by the mi|ni&s;ter of the interior, I found in my way through the &s;econd antichamber, a tall grey-headed old man, of decent appearance, who acco&s;ted me re&s;pectfully: 'I &s;hould be very glad, Madam, to &s;peak with the mi|ni&s;ter, when his dinner is over; I have &s;omething to communicate to him.'&mdash;'Sir, you will &s;ee him in an in&s;tant: he has been detained in the next room: but will be here immediately.' I made my curte&s;y, and proceeded to my own apartment, where Roland &s;oon after joined me. I inquired if he had &s;een a per&s;on, whom I de&s;cribed, and who appear|ed apprehen&s;ive of not meeting him?&mdash;'Yes, it was M. Haudry.'&mdash;'What, the quondam <HI>farmer-gene|ral,</HI> who &s;quandered an immen&s;e fortune!'&mdash;'The &s;ame.'&mdash;'And what has he to do with the mini&s;ter of the interior?'&mdash;'Our bu&s;ine&s;s relates to the ma|nufactory at S&eacute;vres, at the head of which he has been placed.' What a theme for meditation do the&s;e &s;ports of fortune furni&s;h! I had already found one when I entered for the fir&s;t time into the apartments occupied by Madam Necker in the days of her glory. I occupy them a &s;econd time, and they do but the more &s;trongly atte&s;t the in&s;tability of the things of this world; but I will at lea&s;t take care, that no rever&s;e
<PB N="153" REF="034483_0515_0FFDED7F11D7DB18">
of fortune &s;hall find me unprepared. Such were my reflections in October 1792, when Danton was confer|ring &s;ome celebrity upon me, by detracting from my hu&s;band's merit, and was &s;ilently preparing the calum|nies, by which he meant to a&s;&s;ail both. I was ignorant of his proceedings, but I had ob&s;erved the cour&s;e of things in revolutions. I was only ambitious of pre|&s;erving my mind uncontaminated, and of &s;eeing my hu&s;band's reputation free from &s;tain. I well knew this kind of ambition &s;eldom leads to any other &s;pe|cies of &s;ucce&s;s. My wi&s;h is accompli&s;hed: Roland, per&s;ecuted and pro&s;cribed, will not be forgotten by po&s;terity. I am a captive, and &s;hall probably be &s;acri|ficed; but my con&s;cience &s;tands in the &s;tead of every thing. It will happen to me as it did to Solo|mon, who a&s;ked only for wi&s;om, and obtained other advantages: I wi&s;hed only for the peace of the right|eous, and <HI>I al&s;o</HI> &s;hall have &s;ome exi&s;tence in future times.&mdash;But in the mean while let us return to Fon|tenay.</P>
<P>THE little library of my relations afforded &s;ome employment to my mind. I found there the whole of <HI>Puffendorf,</HI> tedious perhaps in his univer&s;al hi&s;tory, and more intere&s;ting to me in his <HI>Duties of the Man and the Citizen;</HI> the <HI>Mai&s;on Ru&s;tique,</HI> and a variety of works on agriculture and economy, which I &s;tudied for want of others, becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould always be learning &s;omething; the agreeable trifles which <HI>Bernis</HI> wrote in ver&s;e, when he was un|fettered

by the <HI>Roman purple</HI>; a life of <HI>Cromwell</HI>; and a curious medley of other productions.</P>
<P>HERE I cannot help remarking, that, in the multi|tude of books which chance or other circum&s;tances had thrown in my way, and of which I mention loo&s;ely &s;uch as places and per&s;ons recal to my memo|ry, nothing by Rou&s;&s;eau has yet been noticed: the truth is, I read him very late; and it was well for me I did: he would have turned my brain, and I &s;hould have read nothing el&s;e. Perhaps as it is, he has but too much &s;trengthened my weak &s;ide, if I may be allowed to make u&s;e of &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I HAVE rea&s;on to believe that my mother had taken &s;ome care to keep him out of my way; but his name not being unknown to me, I had &s;ought af|ter his works, and was already acquainted with his Letters from the Mountain, and his Letter to Chri&s;to|pher de Beaumont, when I lo&s;t her, having then read the whole of Voltaire and Boulanger, the Mar|quis d'Argens and Helvetius, and many other philo&s;o|phers and critics. Probably my mother, who &s;aw plainly that my mind mu&s;t needs be employed, was not much aver&s;e to my making a &s;erious &s;tudy of phi|lo&s;ophy at the ri&s;k even of a little incredulity; but &s;he was of opinion, no doubt, that no &s;timulants were wanting for my &s;u&s;ceptible heart, already too obedient to the impul&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Good heavens! how vain are all our endeavours to e&s;cape from our de&s;tiny! The &s;ame idea influenced her, when &s;he prevented me

He was born in the environs of Prague, had pa&s;&s;ed many years at Vienna, attached to the nobles of the court, and had given le&s;&s;ons to Marie Antoinette. After having been induced to vi&s;it Li&s;bon by particular circum&s;tances, he had at la&s;t cho&s;en Paris, in order to &s;pend in a &s;tate of indepen|dence, the pen&s;ions of which his little fortune was compo&s;ed. He wi&s;hed exceedingly that my mother would permit him to teach me the harp&s;ichord. He in&s;i&s;ted upon it that my fingers and my head would &s;oon go a great length, and that I could not fail to become a compo&s;er.

The Abb&eacute; Jeauket was now and then vi&s;ited by per&s;ons of merit, and whenever he invited them to his hou&s;e, was anxious to include us in his party. Thus, among other individuals not worth remembering, I became acquainted with the learned Rou&s;&s;ier, and the wor|thy d'Odiment; but I have not forgotten the imper|tinent Paradelle and Madam de Pui&s;ieux. Paradelle was a huge mon&s;ter, in the garb of an abb&eacute;, the greate&s;t coxcomb and romancer of all the fools I ever met with, who pretended to have kept a carriage at Lyons for twenty years, and who, to keep him&s;elf from &s;tarving at Paris, was obliged to give lectures on the Italian language, in which he was very little ver|&s;ed. Madam Pui&s;ieux, who pa&s;&s;ed for author of the <HI>Characters,</HI> to which her name is prefixed, re|tained at the age of &s;ixty, with a hump back and toothle&s;s gums, the little airs and preten&s;ions, of which the affectation is &s;carcely pardonable even in youth. I had fancied that a female author mu&s;t needs be a very re&s;pectable per&s;onage, e&s;pecially one who had written upon morals. But Madam de Pui&s;ieux's ab&s;urdities made me change my mind. Her conver|&s;ation be&s;poke very little wit, and her whims indicated very little judgment. I began to perceive it was po&s;|&s;ible

to collect a great deal of rea&s;on, in order to make a di&s;play of it, without con&s;uming much for our own purpo&s;es, and that the men who made a je&s;t of female authors, were perhaps no otherwi&s;e to blame than in applying to them exclu&s;ively, what is equally appli|cable to them&s;elves. Thus it was, that in a &s;phere of life exceedingly confined, I found means to add to my &s;tock of ob&s;ervations. I was in a &s;olitary &s;pot; but it was on the confines of the world, and &s;o &s;ituated as to allow me to di&s;tingui&s;h a great variety of objects without any of them &s;tanding in my way. The con|certs of Madam l'Epine enlarged my pro&s;pect. I have already &s;aid that l'Epine was a pupil of Pigal: he was, indeed, his right hand. At Rome he had married a woman, who, I pre&s;ume, had been an opera &s;inger, and whom his family had at fir&s;t looked upon with an evil eye, but who proved, by the propriety of her conduct, that &s;he did not de&s;erve their di&s;dain.</P>
<P>SHE had a concert of amateurs; compo&s;ed of excel|lent mu&s;icians, to which nobody was admitted but what &s;he called good company. They met every Thur&s;day at her hou&s;e, whither I was often taken by my mother; and there I heard <HI>Jarnewick, St. George, Duport, Guerin,</HI> and many others. There too I met wits of both &s;exes: Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Morville,</HI> Ma|dam <HI>Benoit, Silvain-Marechal,</HI> &amp;c. with haughty ba|rone&s;&s;es, hand&s;ome abb&eacute;s, old chevaliers, and young fops.

Seated by my mother, and keeping the &s;ilence that cu&s;tom pre&s;cribes to young women, I was all eyes and ears; but when we chanced to be for a moment in private with Madam l'Epine, I a&s;ked her a few que&s;tions, the an&s;wers to which elucidated my ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>ONE day that lady propo&s;ed to my mother to ac|company her to a <HI>charming</HI> a&s;&s;embly, held at the hou&s;e of a man of wit, whom we had &s;ometimes &s;een at her concerts: the company con&s;i&s;ted of en|lightned men, and women of ta&s;te; very agree|able productions were recited: it was indeed <HI>delight|ful!</HI> The propo&s;al was made &s;everal times before it was accepted: 'Let us go,' &s;aid I to my mother; 'I begin to know enough of the world to pre&s;ume that it mu&s;t either be very agreeable or very ab&s;urd; and even in the latter ca&s;e, it will &s;erve to amu&s;e us once.

<P>THE ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, &s;eated at a table, which &s;erved as a de&s;k, opened the &s;itting by reading a piece of poetry of his own compo&s;ition: the &s;ubject was a little marmo&s;et which the old marchione&s;s de Pr&eacute;ville always carried in her muff, and which &s;he exhibited to the company; for &s;he was there, and thought &s;he could do no le&s;s than gratify the eager eyes of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent with a &s;ight of the hero of the piece.

Imbert, the author of the <HI>Judgment of Paris,</HI> was therefore obliged to take the chair, and read an agreeable trifle, which was extolled to the &s;kies. His reward awaited him.

Mademoi&s;elle de la Co&s;&s;onni&egrave;re came next with a <HI>Farewell to Colin,</HI> which if not very ingenious, was at lea&s;t very tender. It was known directly that it was addre&s;&s;ed to Imbert, about to undertake a journey, and a &s;hower of compliments was poured upon him. Imbert di&s;charged his own debt, and that of his mu&s;e, by &s;aluting all the females in the a&s;&s;embly. The free and gay ceremony, though conducted with decency, was not at all plea&s;ing to my mother, and appeared in &s;o &s;trange a light to me as to give me an air of embarra&s;&s;ment. After &s;ome epigram or di&s;tich by no means remarkable, a man of pompous declama|tion recited a poem in prai&s;e of Madam Benoit. She was &s;itting by, and mu&s;t be briefly mentioned, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who have not read her romances, which were dead long before the revolution, and will be buried beneath heaps of du&s;t before my memoirs &s;ee the light.</P>
<P>ALBINE was born at Lyons, as I have read in the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the illu&s;trious Women of France, by a Society of Men of Letters;</HI> a hi&s;tory, in which I was quite a&s;toni&s;hed to find women whom I met with every where, as the lady in que&s;tion, Madam de Pui&s;ieux, Madam Champion, and many more, &s;ome of whom perhaps are &s;till alive at the moment I am writing, or have only quitted this terre&s;trial abode within a few years.</P>

<P>MADAM Benoit had been hand&s;ome: the cares of the toilet, and the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, prolonged beyond the age which in&s;ures their &s;ucce&s;s, &s;till pro|cured her a few conque&s;ts. Her eyes canva&s;&s;ed for them with &s;uch ardour; her bo&s;om, always bare, palpitated &s;o anxiou&s;ly to obtain them; that it was impo&s;&s;ible not to grant to the frankne&s;s of de&s;ire, and the facility of &s;atisfying it, what men be&s;tow at all times &s;o readily, when con&s;tancy is not required. Madam Benoit's air of undi&s;gui&s;ed voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, was &s;omething new to me.

tho&s;e encomiums, which they doubtle&s;s conceived to be admirably applied. I recollected all that my read|ing had enabled me to conceive on the &s;ubject of gallantry, and calculated what corruption of heart and perver&s;ion of mind mu&s;t be &s;uperadded by the manners of the age, and the di&s;orders of the court. I &s;aw ef|feminate men giving all their admiration to flim&s;y ver|&s;es, to frivolous talents, and to the de&s;ire of &s;edu|cing every woman that came in their way, and cer|tainly without loving them; for he who devotes him|&s;elf to the happine&s;s of a beloved object, does not court the looks of the crowd. I experienced a &s;en&s;a|tion of di&s;gu&s;t and mi&s;anthropy in the mid&s;t of ob|jects that &s;poke to my imagination, and returned to my &s;olitude in a melancholy mood. We never repeat|ed our vi&s;it to M. V&acirc;&s;e: I had had quite enough of it; and Imbert's ki&s;s, and the penegyric of Madam Benoit, would at any rate have cured my mother of all de&s;ire to take me there again.

The &s;ame re&s;erve was extended to that known as the <HI>concert of amateurs,</HI> which was nume|rou&s;ly attended. We went there but once, attended by a M. Boyard de Creu&s;y, who had amu&s;ed him&s;elf in compo&s;ing new in&s;tructions for the guitar, of which he begged my mother's permi&s;&s;ion

He called on me in the <HI>h&ocirc;tel de l'interieur,</HI> while Roland was in the mini&s;try; and the reception he met with was &s;uch as mu&s;t have convinced him, that I derived &s;atisfaction from the remembrance of a time, on which I have rea&s;on to value my&s;elf, and indeed on every other period of my life.</P>
<P>AS to public places, it was &s;till wor&s;e; my mother never went there; and I was taken but once during her life to the Opera, and once to the <HI>Theatre Fran|&ccedil;ais.</HI> I was then about &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen. <HI>The Union of Love and the Arts,</HI> by Floquet, contained nothing either in the mu&s;ic, or the drama, capable of creating illu&s;ion, or of &s;upporting the idea I had formed of theatrical enchantment. The coldne&s;s of the &s;ubject, the incoherence of the &s;cenes, and awkward intru&s;ions of the ballets, di&s;plea&s;ed me. I was &s;till more di&s;gu&s;ted with the dre&s;s of the dancers, who had not then laid a&s;ide their hoops: I had never &s;een any thing &s;o ab&s;urd. Accordingly I thought the critique of Piron on the wonders of the Opera much &s;uperior to the Opera it&s;elf. At the <HI>Theatre Fran&ccedil;ais</HI> the play was the <HI>Eco&s;&s;oi&s;e,</HI> which was not very well calculated to in&s;pire me with enthu&s;ia&s;m for the

This very pointed attention be|gan to provoke my father's &s;miles, who, wi&s;hing to divert him&s;elf, introduced to me a certain Made|moi&s;elle Michon, a grave church-going woman, one day when &s;he came very ceremoniou&s;ly to demand my hand in the butcher's name. 'You know, daughter,' &s;aid he, with great gravity, that it is a rule with me to lay no con&s;traint upon your inclinations.&mdash;I &s;hall therefore only &s;tate to you a propo&s;al in which you are principally concerned. He then repeated what Mademoi&s;elle Michon had intimated. I &s;crewed up my mouth, a little vexed that my father's good-hu|mour &s;hould turn over to me the ta&s;k of giving an an&s;wer, which he ought to have taken upon him&s;elf. 'You know, papa,' &s;aid I, parodying his mode of expre&s;&s;ion, 'that I con&s;ider my&s;elf as very happy in

my pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and that I am firmly re&s;olved not to quit it for &s;ome years to come. You may take any &s;teps in conformity with this re&s;olution that you think proper:' and on &s;aying this I withdrew.&mdash; 'Why truly,' &s;aid my father, when we were after|wards alone, 'this rea&s;on you have invented is a very fine one for keeping every body away.'&mdash;'I revenged my&s;elf, papa, for the little trick you played me, by a general an&s;wer very becoming a girl; and I left it to you to give a formal refu&s;al: a ta&s;k which I ought not to take upon my&s;elf.'&mdash;'It's an excellent eva&s;ion; but tell me then who it is that will &s;uit you?'&mdash;'Tell me, papa, why, in bringing me up, you taught me to think, and &s;uffered me to contract habits of &s;tudy: I know not what kind of man I &s;hall marry; but it mu&s;t be one who can &s;hare my &s;entiments, and to whom I can communicate my thoughts.'&mdash;'There are men in bu&s;ine&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both of politene&s;s and information.'&mdash;'Yes, but not of the kind I want: their politene&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in a few phra&s;es and bows, and their knowledge always relates to the &s;trong box, and would a&s;&s;i&s;t me but little in the edu|cation of my children.'&mdash;'But you might educate them your&s;elf.'&mdash;'The ta&s;k would appear laborious, if not &s;hared by the man to whom they would owe their exi&s;tence.'&mdash;'Do you &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>l'Empereu</HI>'s wife is not happy? They have ju&s;t retired from bu&s;i|ne&s;s, are buying capital places, keep an excellent hou&s;e, and receive the be&s;t company.'&mdash;'I am no judge of

other people's happine&s;s; but my own affections are not fixed upon riches: I conceive that the &s;tricte&s;t union of hearts is requi&s;ite to conjugal felicity; nor can I connect my&s;elf with a man who does not re&s;em|ble me: my hu&s;band mu&s;t even be my &s;uperior, for &s;ince both nature and the laws give him pre-eminence, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of him, if he did not really de|&s;erve it.'&mdash;'You want a coun&s;ellor, I &s;uppo&s;e? But women are not very happy with tho&s;e learned gentle|men: they have a great deal of pride, and very little money.'&mdash;'My God! papa, I do not judge of a man's merit by his cloth; nor have I ever told you that I affect &s;uch or &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion: I want a man I can love.'&mdash;'But according to you, &s;uch a man is not to be found in trade?'&mdash;'I confe&s;s that I do not think it likely. I have never &s;een a trade&s;man to my liking; and the profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf is my aver&s;ion.'&mdash;'It is, however, a very plea&s;ant thing for a woman to &s;it at her ea&s;e in her own apartment, while her hu&s;band is carrying on a lucrative trade. Now, there's Madam d'Argens: &s;he under&s;tands diamonds as well as her hu&s;band: &s;he deals with the brokers in his ab&s;ence; concludes bargains with private per&s;ons, and would be able to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s, even if left a widow: their fortune is already con&s;iderable, and they belong to the company which has ju&s;t bought Bagnolet. You are intelligent; and, indeed, under&s;tand that branch of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ince you peru&s;ed the treati&s;e on precious &s;tones. You would in&s;pire people with confidence;

you might do whatever you plea&s;e; and a happy life would you have had if you could but have fancied Delorme, Dabreuil, or l'Obligeois.'&mdash;'Hark ye, papa; I have too well perceived that the only way to make a fortune in trade, is by &s;elling dear what has been bought cheap, by overcharging the cu&s;tomer, and beating down the poor workman. I &s;hould never be able to de&s;cend to &s;uch practices, nor to re&s;pect a man who makes them his occupation from morn|ing to night. It is my wi&s;h to be a virtuous wife; but how &s;hould I be faithful to a man who would hold no place in my e&s;teem, even admitting the po&s;&s;ibility of my marrying &s;uch a man? Selling dia|monds and &s;elling pa&s;try &s;eem nearly the &s;ame thing to me; except that the latter has a fixed price, re|quires le&s;s deceit perhaps, but &s;oils the fingers more. I like the one not in any degree better than the other.' &mdash;'Do you &s;uppo&s;e then there are no hone&s;t trade&s;|men?'&mdash;'I will not ab&s;olutely affirm it; but I am per|&s;uaded the number is &s;mall; and the few hone&s;t folks have not all that I require in a hu&s;band.'&mdash;'You are extremely fa&s;tidious, methinks; but if you do not find the idol of your imagination?'&mdash;'I will die a maid.'&mdash;'That would be a harder ta&s;k perhaps, than you imagine. You have time enough, to be &s;ure, to think of it: but <HI>ennui</HI> will come at la&s;t; the crowd will be gone by; and you know the fable!'&mdash; 'Oh!

me of it.'&mdash;'Now you are in the clouds again! It is very plea&s;ant to &s;oar to &s;uch a height; but it is not ea&s;y to keep the elevation: do not forget, however, that I &s;hould like to have grand-children before I am too far advanced in years.'</P>
<P>I SHOULD like to pre&s;ent you with &s;ome, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, when my father put an end to the dialogue, by withdrawing; but mo&s;t certainly I never &s;hall have any, unle&s;s by a hu&s;band to my mind. I experienced a &s;light &s;en&s;ation of melancholy, when on ca&s;ting my eyes about me, I could perceive nothing that was &s;uit|able to my ta&s;te; but the &s;en&s;ation &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided. I was &s;en&s;ible of my pre&s;ent comforts, and hope threw its enlivening beams on the time to come. It was the plenitude of happine&s;s overflowing its banks, and clearing away every thing unplea&s;ant from my future pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>'SHALL I &s;uit you this time, Mademoi&s;elle?' &s;aid my father one day, with affected gravity, and the look of &s;atisfaction which was vi&s;ible upon every new demand. 'Read that letter.' It was very well written as to imagery and &s;tyle, and brought the blood into my cheeks. Mr. Morizot de Rozain expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf hand&s;omely enough, but did not forget to remark that his name was to be found among the nobles of his province. It appeared to me coxcomical and injudicious, to make a parade of an advantage which he knew me not to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and of which he had no right to &s;uppo&s;e me ambitious. 'We have
<PB N="174" REF="034483_0536_1000F6D177AD9210">
here,' &s;aid I, &s;haking my head, 'no great cau&s;e for con&s;ideration: it may be worth while, however, to hear what the gentleman has to &s;ay for him&s;elf: a letter or two more, and I &s;hall be able to found the depth of his preten&s;ions. I will go and draw up an an&s;wer.' When writing was the que&s;tion, my father was as tractable as a child, and &s;at down to copy with|out reluctance. I was much diverted at the idea of acting the papa; and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed my own intere&s;ts with all the gravity &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, and in a &s;tyle of prudence truly parental. No le&s;s than three explana|tory letters came from Mr. de Rozain, which I pre|&s;erved for a long time, becau&s;e they were extremely well written. They proved to me that powers of mind did not &s;uffice, unle&s;s accompanied by &s;uperior judg|ment, and a &s;oul, which nothing can &s;upply the want of, or de&s;cribe, but which is recognized at the fir&s;t glance. Be&s;ides, Rozain had nothing but the title of advocate; my pre&s;ent fortune was not enough for two; nor were his qualities &s;uch as to create a de&s;ire of &s;urmounting that ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>IN announcing the <HI>ri&s;ing en ma&s;&s;e</HI> of my &s;uitors, I did not promi&s;e to name them all, and I &s;hall be readily excu&s;ed. I only wi&s;h to &s;how the &s;ingularity of a &s;ituation, which procured me offers from a great many per&s;ons, who&s;e very faces I was not always ac|quainted with, and in which the examination of rea|&s;ons and appearances was left to my&s;elf. I often, in|deed, perceived new faces ob&s;erving or following me
<PB N="175" REF="034483_0537_1000F6E232C901D0">
at church, or in the public walks, and u&s;ed to &s;ay to my&s;elf, 'I &s;hall &s;oon have an an&s;wer to write for my father.' But I never &s;aw a figure that &s;urpri&s;ed or fa|cinated me.</P>
<P>I HAVE already &s;aid that La Blancherie had wit enough to make his way into our hou&s;e, and to un|der&s;tand, that, before he declared him&s;elf, it was nece&s;&s;ary to gain my good opinion. Though &s;till very young, he had already travelled, had read a great deal, and had even tried his fortune as an author. His work was not good for much; but it contained morality in abundance, and &s;ome ideas that were not ami&s;s. He had intitled it, <HI>Ab&s;tract of my Travels, intended to &s;erve as a School for Fathers and Mothers:</HI> this, as my readers will perceive, was not very mode&s;t; but one could hardly help for|giving him; for he &s;upported him&s;elf by very re&s;pect|able philo&s;ophical authorities, quoted them happily, and inveighed with all the indignation of an hone&s;t heart, again&s;t the coldne&s;s and negligence of parents, too frequently the cau&s;e of the de&s;tructive irregularitie of youth. La Blancherie, diminutive, brown, and ordinary, had no hold on my imagination; but I did not di&s;like his mind, and thought I could perceive that he had a great liking for my per&s;on. One evening, returning with my mother from a vi&s;it to our old rela|tions, we found my father in a thoughtful mood. 'I have news for you,' &s;aid he, &s;miling. 'La Blan|cherie is ju&s;t gone away, after pa&s;&s;ing more than two
<PB N="176" REF="034483_0538_1000F6E3B683CF80">
hours with me; he has told me a &s;ecret; and as it concerns you, Mademoi&s;elle, you mu&s;t be let into it.' (The con&s;equence was not &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary, but it was cu&s;tomary with my father to infer it.) 'He is in love with her, and has propo&s;ed him&s;elf for my &s;on-in-law; but he has no fortune, and it would be a folly, as I have given him to under&s;tand. He is prepar|ing for the bar, and means to purcha&s;e a place in the magi&s;tracy; but what he has to expect from his family, being too little for the purpo&s;e, he has been thinking, that if we like the match, his wife's fortune would &s;upply the deficiency, and that as our girl is an only child, they might live with us for the fir&s;t two or three years. He has been &s;ay|ing a great number of fine things upon the &s;ubject, which may be very &s;atisfactory to youthful fancy, but prudent parents require &s;omething more &s;olid. Let him &s;et up an office, or buy a place; let him, in &s;hort, follow his profe&s;&s;ion: it will be time enough to talk of marriage afterwards; but to begin by mar|rying, would be ab&s;urd in the extreme. Be&s;ides, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to inquire into his character; though that indeed might be ea&s;ily done. I had rather he were not noble, and that he had forty thou&s;and good crowns in his pur&s;e. He is a good young man: we had a great deal of talk together; and though he was a little hurt by my arguments, he li&s;tened to me with patience. At la&s;t he reque&s;ted me not to &s;hut my door again&s;t him, and urged his prayer with &s;o good
<PB N="177" REF="034483_0539_1000F6E545693D18">
a grace, that I con&s;ented, upon condition of his not coming more frequently than before. I told him that I would not &s;ay a word to you; but as I know your di&s;cretion, I never like to keep you in the dark.' A few que&s;tions from my mother, and &s;ome prudent reflections concerning the many things to be con&s;i|dered before we form an affection, &s;aved me the trouble of an&s;wering; but my thoughts were bu&s;ily employed.</P>
<P>THOUGH my father's calculations were well found|ed, there was nothing unrea&s;onable in the young man's propo&s;al; and I felt di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ee him, and to &s;tudy his di&s;po&s;ition with additional intere&s;t and curio&s;ity. My opportunities were few: at the end of &s;ome months La Blancherie &s;et off for Orleans, and I &s;aw no more of him till two years after. In the mean time I was very near marrying Gardanne, the phy&s;i|cian; a match recommended by one of our relations. Madam De&s;portes, a native of Provence, had marri|ed a trade&s;man at Paris; and having been left a widow with an only daughter, at a very early age, had con|tinued to deal in jewels, the bu&s;ine&s;s which my father thought &s;o very agreeable. Sound &s;en&s;e, civility, good breeding, and a great deal of addre&s;s, procured her general e&s;teem: any one, indeed would have &s;up|po&s;ed that &s;he carried on her trade merely to oblige her cu&s;tomers. Without going out of her apartment, which was neatly furni&s;hed, and in which &s;he received a very re&s;pectable &s;ociety, compo&s;ed in part of the
<PB N="178" REF="034483_0540_1000F6974CE46E28">
very per&s;ons who &s;atisfied their wants or their luxury by purcha&s;ing her goods, &s;he maintained her&s;elf in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, without increa&s;ing or dimini&s;hing the little fortune &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Being far advanced in years, &s;he needed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her daughter, who, out of filial affection, rejected all offers of mar|riage, that her intimate union with her mother might not be di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>GARDANNE was a countryman of Madam De&s;|portes. Natural good &s;en&s;e, that lively di&s;po&s;ition &s;o common among the natives of the &s;outh, an excel|lent education, and an extreme de&s;ire to get on, pro|mi&s;ed the young doctor &s;ucce&s;s in a career, already au&s;piciou&s;ly begun. Madam De&s;portes, who receiv|ed him with that patronizing kindne&s;s which became her age and character, and which &s;he had the art of rendering agreeable, conceived the idea of giving him her young cou&s;in for a wife; but death overtook her while intent upon this project, which her daughter re|&s;olved to execute.</P>
<P>GARDANNE both de&s;ired and feared the connec|tion. In con&s;idering the advantages and incon|veniences of becoming a <HI>Benedict,</HI> he did not, like my romantic brain, attend to per&s;onal qualities alone: he calculated every thing. My fortune was only twenty thou&s;and liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es<NOTE PLACE="foot">883l.</NOTE>; but the &s;mallne&s;s of
<PB N="179" REF="034483_0541_1000F7455A7C8098">
this &s;um was compen&s;ated by con&s;iderable expecta|tions. The pecuniary arrangements were made before I knew any thing of the matter, and the <HI>bargain</HI> ab&s;olutely concluded, when I fir&s;t heard that a phy&s;ician had entered the li&s;ts. The profe&s;&s;ion did not di&s;plea&s;e me; it promi&s;ed an enlightened mind: but it was nece&s;&s;ary to become acquainted with his per&s;on. A walk in the Luxemburg gardens was propo&s;ed; we were to be overtaken by the rain; and the rain came, or at lea&s;t was apprehended. We ran for &s;helter to the hou&s;e of a Mademoi&s;elle de la Barre, a rigid Jan&s;eni&s;t, and a friend of Madam De&s;portes, who was overjoyed at the cir|cum&s;tance, and offered us refre&s;hments, which we were taking, when her phy&s;ician came with his countrywoman in the very moment to pay her a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>A MINUTE &s;urvey took place on both &s;ides, with|out any appearance, on my part, of being &s;o em|ployed, but at the &s;ame time without my &s;uffering any thing to e&s;cape me. My cou&s;in a&s;&s;umed an air of triumph, as if &s;he would have &s;aid, 'I did not tell you &s;he was hand&s;ome: but what do you think of her?' My good mother looked kind and pen&s;ive; Mademoi&s;elle de la Barre was equally profu&s;e of her wit and her confectionary; the phy&s;ician chattered away, and made great havoc among the &s;ugar-plums, &s;aying, with a &s;ort of gallantry, that favoured a lit|tle of the &s;chool-boy, that he was very fond of every
<PB N="180" REF="034483_0542_1000F747A9AD99F8">
thing &s;weet; upon which the young lady ob&s;erved with a &s;oft voice, a blu&s;h, and a half &s;mile, that the men were accu&s;ed of loving &s;weet things, becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of great &s;weetne&s;s in deal|ing with them. The cunning doctor was quite tickled with the epigram. My father would willingly have given us his benediction, and was &s;o polite, that I was out of all patience with him. The doctor retired fir&s;t to pay his evening vi&s;its; we returned as we came; and this was called an <HI>interview.</HI> Mademoi&s;elle De&s;|portes, a &s;trict ob&s;erver of punctilios, had &s;o ordered it, becau&s;e for&s;ooth a man who has views of mar|riage ought never to &s;et his foot in a private hou&s;e, where there is a daughter, until his propo&s;als are accepted; but when once that is done, the mar|riage articles are directly to be drawn up, and the con&s;ummation is to follow immediately. This is the law and the prophets. A phy&s;ician in the ha|biliments of his profe&s;&s;ion, is never a plea&s;ing object to a young woman; nor could I indeed, at any pe|riod of life, figure to my&s;elf &s;uch a thing as love in a periwig. Gardanne with his three tails, his phy&s;ical look, his &s;outhern accent, and his black eye-brows, &s;eemed much more likely to allay than to excite a fe|ver. But this I felt without making the reflection: my ideas of marriage were &s;o &s;erious, that I could not perceive any thing laughable in his propo&s;als.&mdash; 'Well,' &s;aid my good mother to me, in a tone of ten|der inquiry, 'what think you of this man? Will he
<PB N="181" REF="034483_0543_1000F7492C1B88D0">
&s;uit you?'&mdash;'My dear mamma, it is impo&s;&s;ible yet for me to tell.'&mdash;'But you can certainly tell whether he has in&s;pired you with di&s;like.'&mdash;'Neither di&s;like nor inclination: which of the two may come hereafter, I cannot &s;ay.'&mdash;'We ought to know however what an|&s;wer to give in ca&s;e a propo&s;al &s;hould be made in form.'&mdash;'Is the an&s;wer to be binding?'&mdash;A&s;&s;uredly, if we pa&s;s our word to a decent man, we mu&s;t adhere to it.'&mdash;'And if I &s;hould not like him?'&mdash;'A rea&s;on|able young woman, not actuated by caprice, after hav|ing once maturely weighed the motives that deter|mine her in &s;o important a re&s;olution, will never change her mind.'&mdash;'I am to decide then upon the &s;trength of a &s;ingle interview.'&mdash;'Not exactly that: the intimacy of M. de Gardanne with our family ena|bles us to judge of his conduct and way of life, and by means of a little inquiry we &s;hall ea&s;ily come at a knowledge of his di&s;po&s;ition. The&s;e are the prin|cipal points to found a determination upon: the &s;ight of the per&s;on is a matter of much le&s;s moment.'&mdash;'Ah mamma! I am in no ha&s;te to be married.'&mdash;'I believe it, daughter; but you mu&s;t &s;ettle your&s;elf in the world &s;ome time or other; and you have now attained the proper age. You have refu&s;ed many offers from trade&s;men; and they are the people from whom your &s;ituation makes offers the mo&s;t likely to come: you &s;eem determined never to marry a man in bu&s;ine&s;s; the match at pre|&s;ent in que&s;tion is &s;uitable in every external point of
<PB N="182" REF="034483_0544_1000F74B9873EEF8">
view.&mdash;Take care then not to reject it too lightly.'&mdash; 'It appears to me there is time enough to think about it; M. Gardanne has, perhaps, made no deci&s;ion him&s;elf; for it is certain that he never &s;aw me before.' &mdash;'True; but if that be your only excu&s;e, it is po&s;|&s;ible it may not be of long duration: I do not, how|ever, require an immediate an&s;wer. Revolve the matter in your mind, and two days hence let me know what you think about it.' On &s;aying this, my mother ki&s;&s;ed my forehead, and withdrew.</P>
<P>REASON and nature concur &s;o well in per&s;uading a prudent and mode&s;t young woman that &s;he ought to marry, that all deliberation upon the &s;ubject is nece&s;&s;arily confined to the choice of a mate. Now, as to this choice the arguments of my mother were by no means de&s;titute of force. I con&s;idered, be&s;ides, that my provi&s;ional acceptance, however it might be con&s;trued, could never amount to a po&s;itive engagement; and that it would be ab|&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e me under contract, becau&s;e I might con&s;ent to &s;ee the per&s;on propo&s;ed at my father's hou&s;e. I was &s;en&s;ible too, if I &s;hould di&s;like him, no con&s;ideration upon earth could induce me to ac|cept his hand. I determined then, within my&s;elf, not to &s;ay no, but to wait till we &s;hould become bet|ter acquainted.</P>
<P>WE were ju&s;t on the point of &s;etting off for the country, where we were to pa&s;s a fortnight. I thought it would be improper to delay our jour|ney
<PB N="183" REF="034483_0545_1000F698CEAB95B0">
in expectation of a &s;uitor, and my mother was of the &s;ame opinion; but when we were on the eve of our departure, Mademoi&s;elle de la Barre came in great form to demand my hand in the doctor's name. My parents an&s;wered in the general terms that people employ when they wi&s;h it to be under&s;tood that their con&s;ent will depend upon further con&s;ideration. Per|mi&s;&s;ion, however, was a&s;ked, and granted, for the lover to pay his re&s;pects in per&s;on. Mademoi&s;elle De&s;portes, with her u&s;ual formality, concluded it was her bu&s;ine&s;s to be his conductor; and a family col|lation, at which Mademoi&s;elle de la Barre and one of my female relations were pre&s;ent, &s;erved to celebrate the gentleman's ceremonious entry into my father's hou&s;e. The next day we &s;et off for the country, on purpo&s;e to pa&s;s there the preci&s;e time nece&s;&s;ary for in|quiries. The &s;econd interview made no greater impre&s;|&s;ion upon me than the fir&s;t; but I thought I could perceive that Gardanne was a &s;en&s;ible man, with whom a rational woman might live upon good terms; and, like an unexperienced girl, I concluded that when once it was po&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on and under&s;tand one another, a &s;ufficient provi&s;ion was made for ma|trimonial bli&s;s.</P>
<P>MY mother was afraid that he &s;howed &s;igns of an imperious di&s;po&s;ition; an idea that never came into my mind: accu&s;tomed to watch over my&s;elf, to regulate my affections, and to keep my imagination within bounds, and impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the
<PB N="184" REF="034483_0546_1000F74D1E142260">
rigour and &s;ublimity of the duties of a wife, I could not under&s;tand what difference a di&s;po&s;ition, a little more or a little le&s;s indulgent, could make to me, nor what more could be required of me than I required of my&s;elf. I rea&s;oned like a philo&s;opher who calculates, or like a reclu&s;e equally a &s;tranger to the pa&s;&s;ions, and to mankind. I took my tranquil, affectionate, gene|rous, and candid heart, as a common mea&s;ure of the moral qualities of my &s;pecies. I continued a long while to be guilty of that fault. It was the only &s;ource of my errors. I ha&s;ten to point it out: it is giving beforehand the key of my &s;crutoire. I carried with me into the country a &s;ort of inquietude: it was not that gentle agitation with which the beauties of nature u&s;ually in&s;pired me, and which rendered its charms &s;till more grateful to my feelings. I found my&s;elf upon the eve of a new exi&s;tence: I was going perhaps, to quit my excellent mother, my darling &s;tudies, my beloved retirement, and a &s;ort of inde|pendence, for a &s;tate which I could not well define, and which would impo&s;e on me the mo&s;t import|ant obligations. I thought it an honour to have them to di&s;charge, and was proud of being able to undertake them; but the pro&s;pect was clouded, and I experienced all the hopes and fears of incertitude. Mademoi&s;elle De&s;portes had made me promi&s;e to write to her; and I kept my word: but at the end of a fortnight, I heard &s;he was very much afflicted. My father, who did every thing by rule, would
<PB N="185" REF="034483_0547_1000F750E144E438">
never have believed that he had married his daughter properly, and fulfilled the duty of a parent, if he had not made his cu&s;tomary inquiries in due form. Gardanne had been introduced by one of our rela|tions, who knew his family, and was intimate with him|&s;elf. All po&s;&s;ible information had been afforded, but it did not &s;ignify; my father had written to three or four per&s;ons in Provence, at the very beginning of the bu&s;ine&s;s, to inquire into the mo&s;t minute particulars of the doctor's family and habits. During our ab&s;ence, his vigilance did not even &s;top there: he employed a variety of little manoeuvres, in order to learn from &s;er|vants and trade&s;men, the temper and way of life of his future &s;on-in-law. Nor was that all; he went to pay him a vi&s;it; and, with an addre&s;s equal to that which he had made u&s;e of in his inquiries, when he let every body &s;ee why he was making them, he affect|ed to be very well informed. He mentioned to Gar|danne in an awkward way, and as a man whom he ought to re&s;pect, one of his countrymen with whom he was at variance, and added premature advice to his remarks in the authoritative tone of a father. Gardan|ne received at one and the &s;ame time, letters from the country, rallying him upon the inquiries to which he gave occa&s;ion, intelligence of the inqui&s;ition carrying on concerning his private affairs, and the pedagogical exhortation of his intended father-in-law. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, vexed, and irritated, he went to Mademoi&s;elle De&s;por|tes and complained with all the warmth of a native of
<PB N="186" REF="034483_0548_1000F752648BE178">
the &s;outh, of the &s;trange conduct of a man, who&s;e amiable daughter had no other fault than that of having &s;o &s;ingular a father. Mademoi&s;elle De&s;portes, fiery, as well as him&s;elf, and full of pride, was much di&s;|plea&s;ed at his being &s;o little in love with her cou&s;in as to complain of trifles like the&s;e, and gave him a very in|different reception. The very moment the&s;e circum|&s;tances came to my knowledge, I eagerly embraced the opportunity of putting an end to my incer|titude; and wrote to &s;ay, that, on my return, I hoped to &s;ee no more of my phy&s;ical &s;uitor. Such was the <HI>denouement</HI> of a marriage which it was intended to hurry on with &s;o much &s;peed, that Gardanne ex|pected to conclude the bu&s;ine&s;s in a week after my re|turn. I congratulated my&s;elf on e&s;caping ties, that my friends would fain have drawn clo&s;ely in &s;o &s;udden a manner; my mother, alarmed at the doctor's warmth of temper, felt as if delivered from &s;ome dreadful danger, though grieving a little on other ac|counts; my father endeavoured to conceal his &s;hame and di&s;appointment under the veil of lordly dignity; and my cou&s;in pre&s;erved hers by forbidding the doc|tor to &s;et his foot in her hou&s;e. Five years after, Ma|demoi&s;elle de la Barre told her, that this marriage was written in heaven; that her friend kept him&s;elf free from all other engagements; and that the hand of Providence was preparing to bring us together, by means in&s;crutable to human eyes.</P>

<P>MY mother's health began in&s;en&s;ibly to decline. She had had a &s;troke of the pal&s;y, which was repre&s;ented to me as the rheumati&s;m, a pious fraud, in which, without flattering her&s;elf, &s;he willingly joined, in or|der to prevent my taking any alarm. Serious and ta|citurn, &s;he every day lo&s;t a portion of her vivacity; was fond of &s;ecluding her&s;elf from the world; and obliged me, &s;ometimes, to go out with the maid, refu|&s;ing to quit her apartment. She often talked of my changing my condition, and lamented I could not prevail on my&s;elf to clo&s;e with any of the offers that were made me. One day in particular, &s;he urged me, with melancholy earne&s;tne&s;s, to accept an hone&s;t jew|eller who had demanded my hand: 'He has in favour, &s;aid &s;he, 'great reputation for integrity, habits of &s;o|briety, and mildne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, with an ea&s;y for|tune, which may become brilliant; and that circum|&s;tance makes part of the merit of a man, who is not remarkable for his per&s;onal advantages. He knows that yours is not a common mind, profe&s;&s;es great e&s;teem for you, will be proud of following your ad|vice, and &s;ays already that he would not object to his wife's &s;uckling her children. You might lead him any way you like.'&mdash;'Why, mamma, I do not want a hu&s;band who is to be led; he would be too cumber&s;ome a child for me.'&mdash;'Do you know that you are a very whim&s;ical girl? for after all you would not

like a ma&s;ter.'&mdash;'My dear mother, let us under&s;tand one another: I &s;hould not like a man to give him&s;elf airs of authority: he would only teach me to re&s;i&s;t; but at the &s;ame time, I &s;hould not like a hu&s;band whom it would be nece&s;&s;ary to govern. Either I am much mi&s;taken, or tho&s;e beings five foot and a half high, with beards upon their chins, &s;eldom fail to make us perceive that they are the &s;tronger. Now if the good man &s;hould think proper to remind me of that &s;uperiority, he would provoke me; and if he &s;hould &s;ubmit to be governed, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of my own power.'&mdash;'I under&s;tand you; you would like a man to think him&s;elf the ma&s;ter, while obey|ing you in every thing.'&mdash;'No, it is not that either: I hate &s;ervitude, but I do not think my&s;elf made for empire; it would only embarra&s;s me; my rea&s;on finds it quite enough to take care of my&s;elf. I &s;hould wi&s;h to gain the affections of a man &s;o completely worthy of my e&s;teem, that I might be proud of my complai|&s;ance; of a man who would make his happine&s;s con|&s;i&s;t in contributing to mine, in the way that his good &s;en&s;e and affection might think meet.'&mdash;'Happine&s;s, daughter, does not always con&s;i&s;t in that perfect con|formity of ideas and affections which you imagine; if without that it could not exi&s;t, there would be hardly any &s;uch thing as a happy couple.'&mdash;'Neither do I know any who&s;e happine&s;s I envy.'&mdash;'Perhaps &s;o; but &s;till among tho&s;e matches you do not envy, there may be many preferable to always living &s;ingle. I may

be called out of the world &s;ooner than you imagine; you would remain with your father; he is &s;till young, and you cannot imagine all the di&s;agreeable things that my fondne&s;s for you makes me fear. How hap|py &s;hould I be, if I could but leave you united to an hone&s;t man, when I depart from this world.' The&s;e la&s;t ideas afflicted me beyond mea&s;ure: my mother &s;eemed to lift up the veil that concealed a &s;ad and dreadful futurity, which I did not even apprehend. I had never thought of lo&s;ing her; and the mere idea of &s;uch an event, which &s;he &s;poke of as approaching, &s;truck me with terror; a cold &s;hivering &s;eized my whole frame; I gazed upon her with wild and eager eyes, from which her &s;miles drew forth a flood of tears. 'What! you are alarmed? as if, in taking our re&s;olutions, we ought not to calculate all po&s;&s;i|ble chances. I am not ill, though at a critical time of life, of which the revolutions frequently prove fa|tal; but it is in health that we ought to provide again&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, and the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion makes it peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary. An hone&s;t and worthy man offers you his hand; you are turned of twenty, and will no longer &s;ee &s;o many &s;uitors as have tendered you their homage during the la&s;t five years. I may be &s;natched away&mdash;do not then reject a hu&s;band, who has not, it is true, the delicacy on which you &s;et &s;o great a value (a quality very rare, even where we look for it the mo&s;t); but he is a man who will love you, and with whom you may be happy.'&mdash;'Yes,
<PB N="190" REF="034483_0552_1000F758DCBC9140">
mamma,' cried I with a deep &s;igh, 'happy as you have been!' My mother was di&s;concerted, and made me no reply, nor from that moment did &s;he ever open her lips to me about that or any other match, at lea&s;t in a pre&s;&s;ing manner. The remark had e&s;caped me, as the expre&s;&s;ion of an acute feeling e&s;capes us when we have not taken time to reflect: the effect it pro|duced convinced me that it was too true.</P>
<P>A STRANGER might have perceived at the fir&s;t glance the great difference between my father and mother: but who could feel like me all the excel|lence of the latter? I had not, however, fully calcu|lated all &s;he mu&s;t have had to &s;uffer. Accu&s;tomed from my infancy to &s;ee the mo&s;t profound peace prevail in the hou&s;e, I could not judge of the painful efforts it might co&s;t to maintain it. My fa|ther loved his wife, and was tenderly fond of me. Never&mdash;I will not &s;ay a reproach&mdash;but never did even a look of di&s;content break in upon the good hu|mour of my mother. When &s;he was not of her hu&s;|band's opinion, and could not prevail upon him to modify it, &s;he appeared to pa&s;s &s;entence upon her own without the &s;malle&s;t reluctance. It was on|ly during the latter years of her life, that, feel|ing my&s;elf hurt by my father's mode of rea&s;on|ing, I &s;ometimes took the liberty to inter&s;ere in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: by degrees I gained a certain &s;ort of a&s;cendance, and availed my&s;elf of it with con&s;iderable freedom. Whether it was the novelty of my enter|pri&s;e
<PB N="191" REF="034483_0553_1000F75A5FA70ED0">
that confounded him, or whether it was weakne&s;s, I know not, but my father yielded to me more readily than to his wife; I always exerted my influence in her defence; and might not unaptly have been termed my mother's watch-dog. It was no longer &s;afe to mole&s;t her in my pre&s;ence&mdash;either by barking, or by pulling the &s;kirt of the coat, or by &s;hewing my teeth in good earne&s;t, I was &s;ure to make the a&s;&s;ailant let go his hold. It is worthy of remark, that, being no le&s;s re&s;erved than my mother in regard to her hu&s;band, I never &s;aid a word to her in private, and out of his hearing, that was not con&s;i&s;tent with filial re&s;pect. I employed in her defence the force, I will &s;ay even the authority of rea&s;on, when addre&s;s did not &s;uffice; but when we were alone I &s;hould not have dared to utter a word relative to what had pa&s;&s;ed. For her &s;ake I could en|ter the li&s;ts even again&s;t her hu&s;band; but that hu&s;|band, when ab&s;ent, was no longer any thing but my father, about whom we were both &s;ilent, unle&s;s when any thing could be &s;aid in his prai&s;e. I could perceive however, that he had lo&s;t by degrees his habits of in|du&s;try. Pari&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s having fir&s;t called him from home; &s;auntering abroad afterwards became a pa&s;&s;ion. All public &s;pectacles, and every thing that was pa&s;&s;ing out of doors, attracted his attention; a pa&s;&s;ion for gaming next laid hold of him; connexions made at the coffee-hou&s;e led him el&s;ewhere: and the lottery held out temptations which he could not re&s;i&s;t. The de&s;ire of making a fortune having engaged him in
<PB N="192" REF="034483_0554_1000F75C1911FFD0">
&s;peculations, quite foreign to his profe&s;&s;ion, and not always &s;ucce&s;sful, that de&s;ire, when once he had lo&s;t his affiduity, made him &s;et every thing at hazard. In proportion as his art was le&s;s exerci&s;ed, his talents dimini&s;hed; and by leading a le&s;s regular life, he impaired his faculties: his &s;ight grew weak, and his hand lo&s;t its &s;teadine&s;s. His pupils being le&s;s &s;uperin|tended by their ma&s;ter, became le&s;s able to &s;upply his place; and it was &s;oon found nece&s;&s;ary to dimini&s;h their number, becau&s;e the tide of bu&s;ine&s;s nece&s;&s;arily flowed el&s;ewhere. Tho&s;e changes took place by in|&s;en&s;ible degrees, and their effect became very per|ceptible, before any one had calculated all its con&s;e|quences. My mother grew pen&s;ive, and began now and then to give me imperfect intimations of her unea&s;ine&s;s, which I was fearful of increa&s;ing by &s;peaking of what neither &s;he nor I could prevent. I was careful to procure her every &s;atisfaction that depended upon me; and as &s;he was grown aver&s;e to walking, I &s;ometimes con&s;ented to leave her, in order to go abroad with my father, whom I reque&s;t|ed to take me out for a walk. He no longer &s;ought to have me with him as formerly; but he &s;till took a plea&s;ure in attending me, and I u&s;ed to bring him back in a &s;ort of triumph to that excellent mother who&s;e tender emotions I could ea&s;ily perceive when|ever &s;he &s;aw us together. We were not always gainers by it; for my father, that he might neither refu&s;e his daughter, nor be di&s;appointed of his plea|&s;ures,
<PB N="193" REF="034483_0555_1000F75E884F9FE0">
would fir&s;t &s;ee me &s;afe home, and then go out again, for an in&s;tant, as he &s;aid; but in&s;tead of re|turning to &s;upper, he would forget the hour, and not come home till midnight. In the mean time we had been weeping in &s;ilence; and if it happened to me, on his return, to repre&s;ent to him our chagrin, he treated the matter lightly, parrying my gentle re|proaches by raillery, or el&s;e retired in the &s;ilence of di&s;content. Our dome&s;tic happine&s;s was buried be|neath the&s;e clouds; but the peace of the family re|mained unaltered, &s;o that an indifferent &s;pectator would not have perceived the changes that were daily taking place.</P>
<P>MY mother had &s;uffered con&s;iderably, for more than a year, from a kind of ob&s;truction in the re&s;pi|ratory pa&s;&s;ages, which re&s;embled a cold in the head, but of which her phy&s;icians were totally unable to im|agine the cau&s;e. After various remedies, they re|commended exerci&s;e, which &s;he was no longer fond of, and country air. That was ju&s;t before Whit&s;un|tide of the year 1775, and it was agreed that we &s;hould pa&s;s the holydays at Meudon. On the Sunday morning I did not wake, as I was accu&s;tomed to do when any of tho&s;e rural excur&s;ions were in agitation: I was overcome by broken and unea&s;y &s;leep, and tor|mented by ill-omened dreams. I thought we were re|turning to Paris by water, in the mid&s;t of a &s;torm; and upon getting out of the boat, a corp&s;e that was dragging a&s;hore impeded my way. I was terrified
<PB N="194" REF="034483_0556_1000F760C1BBDCE8">
at the &s;ight, and was endeavouring to find out who&s;e body it could be.&mdash;At that very in&s;tant, my mother, laying her hand lightly upon my legs, and calling me with her &s;oft voice, put an end to my dream. I was as much rejoiced at &s;eeing her, as if &s;he had &s;aved me from the mo&s;t imminent danger; I &s;tretched out my arms, and embraced her with emotion, telling her &s;he had done me great kindne&s;s by waking me. I got up; we made our arrangments, and &s;et off. The weather was fine, the air calm, a little boat conveyed us &s;peedily to the place of our de&s;tination, and the charms of the country re&s;tored my &s;erenity. My mother was the better for the journey; and re&s;umed a portion of her activity. It was on the &s;econd day we di&s;covered Ville-bonne, and the water-bailiff of the Moulin Rouge. I had promi&s;ed my Agatha to call upon her the day after the holydays; we returned on Tue&s;day evening; and my mother purpo&s;ed ac|companying me to the convent; but being a little fa|tigued with the exerci&s;e of the preceding days, &s;he changed her mind at the moment I was &s;etting off, and de&s;ired the maid to accompany me. I then wi&s;hed to &s;tay at home; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my keeping my word; adding, that I well knew &s;he had no ob|jection to being alone, and that if de&s;irous of taking a turn in the <HI>Jardin du Roi,</HI> I was free &s;o to do.</P>
<P>MY vi&s;it to Agatha was a &s;hort one: 'Why are you in &s;uch ha&s;te?' &s;aid &s;he; 'does any one expect
<PB N="195" REF="034483_0557_1000F76244A558A8">
you?'&mdash;'No; but I am anxious to return to my mother.'&mdash;'Why, you told me &s;he was well.'&mdash;'I did &s;o; nor does &s;he expect me &s;o &s;oon; but I know not what it is that torments me: I &s;hall not be ea&s;y till I &s;ee her again.' On &s;aying this, I felt my heart &s;well, as it were, in &s;pite of me.</P>
<P>IT may, perhaps, be &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e circum&s;tances are added by the reflection of a &s;entiment, which lends its colour to preceding incidents.&mdash;I am no more than a faithful hi&s;torian, and relate facts, which the event alone afterwards recalled to my mind.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t certainly have appeared from the expo&s;ition of my opinions, and &s;till more from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive developement of the ideas I had acquired, that I was at that time no more infected with certain prejudices, than I am now with &s;uper&s;tition. Accordingly, in re|flecting upon what are called <HI>pre&s;entiments,</HI> I have often thought they are nothing more than rapid glan|ces caught by per&s;ons of quick perception and ex|qui&s;ite feelings, of a multitude of things which are &s;carcely perceptible, which cannot even be de&s;cribed, which are rather felt than under&s;tood, and from which an affection re&s;ults that is not to be accounted for, although it is afterwards ju&s;tified by the event.</P>
<P>THE more lively the intere&s;t any object in&s;pires, the &s;tronger is our perception or &s;en&s;ibility in regard to that object, and the more we have of tho&s;e phy&s;ical notices, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, which are afterwards called pre&s;entiments, and which
<PB N="196" REF="034483_0558_1000F763DA11A138">
the ancients con&s;idered as auguries, or intimations given by the gods.</P>
<P>MY mother was to me the deare&s;t object upon earth: &s;he was drawing near her end, without any external &s;ign that might &s;erve to announce it to common ob&s;ervers: nor had my attention yet di&s;tin|gui&s;hed any thing that clearly indicated &s;o dread|ful a blow; but doubtle&s;s &s;ome &s;light alterations mu&s;t have taken place in her, by which I was agi|tated without knowing why: I could not &s;ay that I was unea&s;y, becau&s;e I &s;hould not have known why; but my mind was not at peace; my heart frequently &s;unk within me while looking at her; and when|ever I left her, I experienced a di&s;agreeable feeling that made me impatient to return. When I was taking leave of Agatha, there was &s;omething &s;o &s;in|gular in my manner, that &s;he begged me to let her hear from me immediately. I hurried home not|with&s;tanding the ob&s;ervations of the maid, who was of opinion that a walk in the <HI>Jardin du Roi</HI> would be very plea&s;ant at that time of day. I came to the hou&s;e, and found a little girl of the neigh|bourhood &s;tanding at the door:&mdash;'Ah! Made|moi&s;elle,' exclaimed &s;he, on &s;eeing me, 'your mam|ma is taken very ill; &s;he has been for my mother, who is gone up &s;tairs with her to her apartment.' Struck with affright, I uttered a few inarticulate &s;ounds: I ran, I flew into the room; and there I found my mother in an armed-chair, with her head
<PB N="197" REF="034483_0559_1000F80970680F30">
fallen on her &s;houlder, her eyes wild, her mouth open, and her arms hanging down. On &s;eeing me, her countenance brightened; &s;he endeavoured to &s;peak, but her tongue could with difficulty utter a few half-formed words: &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ay, that &s;he was wait|ing for me with impatience; &s;he made an effort to rai&s;e her arms; one only obeyed the impul&s;e of her will; &s;he laid her hand on my face, wiped away the tears that bedewed it with her fingers; tapped me gently on the cheek, as if to comfort me; an effort to &s;mile appeared in her countenance; &s;he tried to &s;peak:&mdash;vain efforts! the pal&s;y tied her tongue, &s;unk her head, and annihilated half her body. Nei|ther Hungary water, nor &s;alt put into her mouth, nor friction, produced any effect. In an in&s;tant I had di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers for my father, and the phy|&s;ician; I had darted like lightning my&s;elf to fetch two grains of tartar emetic from the next apotheca|ry's. The phy&s;ician came; my mother was put into bed; and medicines were admini&s;tered: the di&s;order notwith&s;tanding made a dreadful progre&s;s. Her eyes were clo&s;ed; her head, &s;unk upon her che&s;t, could no longer &s;upport it&s;elf; and her &s;hort and convul|&s;ive breathing indicated a general oppre&s;&s;ion of the whole body. She heard however what was &s;aid, and when a&s;ked if &s;he felt much pain, pointed out the &s;eat of her &s;ufferings by putting her left hand to her fore|head. I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly active; I ordered every thing, and had always done it my&s;elf before it
<PB N="198" REF="034483_0560_1000F69DDF9645F0">
could be done by any other per&s;on: I appeared not to quit her bed &s;ide, and yet I prepared for her every thing &s;he wanted. About ten o'clock in the evening I &s;aw the phy&s;ician take my father and two or three women a&s;ide; I begged to know what he had pro|po&s;ed; and was told that they had &s;ent for the ex|treme unction:&mdash;I thought it was all a dream. The prie&s;t came, began to pray, and performed a ceremo|ny I did not under&s;tand, while I held a light to him, in obedience to a mere mechanical impul&s;e. Stand|ing at the foot of the bed without an&s;wering, or giving way to tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to take my place, with my eyes fixed on my adored and dying mother, and en|tirely occupied by a &s;ingle &s;entiment, which at length &s;u&s;pended all my faculties, I let the candle drop out of my hand, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor. I was carried off, and found my&s;elf, &s;ome time after|wards, in the parlour adjoining to my bed-chamber, &s;urrounded by the family. I turned my eyes to|wards the door; I ro&s;e from my &s;eat; and finding my&s;elf held back, made &s;uppliant ge&s;tures to ob|tain permi&s;&s;ion to return. A &s;olemn &s;ilence, and a mournful but con&s;tant oppo&s;ition, counteracted my de&s;ire. I regained my &s;trength; I begged; I in|&s;i&s;ted; but they were inexorable; and I broke out into a &s;ort of rage. At that in&s;tant my father walked into the room, pale and &s;peechle&s;s with grief; and an&s;wered to the &s;ilent inquiry that every one &s;eemed to make, by a look which drew forth a general excla|mation
<PB N="199" REF="034483_0561_1000F80AF270C3F8">
of &s;orrow. The con&s;ternation of tho&s;e around me gave me an opportunity of getting away; I ru&s;hed forth impetuou&s;ly; my mother&mdash;&s;he was no more! I lifted up her arms; I could not believe it: I opened and clo&s;ed alternately tho&s;e eyes that were never to &s;ee me again, and that were wont to rivet them&s;elves upon me with &s;uch endearing tenderne&s;s: I called her; I threw my&s;elf upon her bed in a tran&s;port of grief: I pre&s;&s;ed my lips to her's; I &s;eparated them; I endea|voured to inhale death: I hoped to draw it in with my breath, and in&s;tantly to expire. I know not well what followed; I only remember, that towards the morning I found my&s;elf at a neighbours, whither M. Be&s;nard came, who had me put into a carriage, and conveyed me to his hou&s;e. We alighted; my great aunt embraced me in &s;ilence; &s;et me down at a little table; offered me &s;omething to drink, and entreated me to take it. I tried to gratify her, and fainted away. They put me to bed, and there I pa&s;&s;ed a fortnight, between life and death, in the mo&s;t dreadful convul+&s;ions. The phy&s;ical &s;en&s;ation, which I remember, was that of a continual &s;uffocation; and my re&s;piration, as I was afterwards told, was a kind of howling, that was heard in the &s;treet: I had &s;uffered a revolution, which my &s;ituation rendered &s;till more critical, and from which I was only &s;aved by a &s;trong con&s;titution, and by the boundle&s;s attentions that were lavi&s;hed on me. My re&s;pectable relations removed their beds into little clo&s;ets, to afford me a more comfortable

lodging; they &s;eemed to have a&s;&s;umed new vigour, in order to redeem me from the grave; and would not permit any thing to be offered me by a mercenary hand. They in&s;i&s;ted upon waiting on me them&s;elves, and would only con&s;ent to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by my cou&s;in, a young woman of the name of Trude, who came every evening to pa&s;s the night with me, lying in the &s;ame bed, and careful to anticipate and relieve the fits of convul&s;ion with which I was frequently &s;eized.</P>
<P>EIGHT days had elap&s;ed, and I had not &s;hed a tear: great &s;orrows, alas! are not relieved &s;o ea&s;ily.&mdash; (The &s;calding drops, at this moment, are &s;treaming down my cheeks; for I dread an evil &s;till greater than what I &s;uffer. All my hopes and wi&s;hes were centred in the &s;afety of what I love; and its fate is become more uncertain than ever! Calamities &s;preading like a dark and dreadful cloud, are ready to envelope all that was dear to me; and I labour, with difficulty and pain, to divert my attention from the pre&s;ent, by obliging my|&s;elf to retrace the pa&s;t.)&mdash;</P>
<P>AN epi&s;tle from Sophy came to open the &s;ource of my tears; the &s;oothing voice and tender expre&s;|&s;ions of friend&s;hip recalled my faculties, and &s;poke con&s;olation to my heart. They produced an effect, which the warm bath, and the medical art, had courted in vain: a new revolution took place; I wept, and was &s;aved. The &s;uffocation dimini&s;hed; all the dangerous &s;ymptoms abated, and the convul&s;ions be|came
<PB N="201" REF="034483_0563_0FFDEEF622A366B0">
le&s;s frequent; but every painful impre&s;&s;ion was &s;ure to bring on a fit.</P>
<P>MY father pre&s;ented him&s;elf to me in the &s;ad ap|parel, that te&s;tified a lo&s;s, common to us both, but unequally felt: he undertook to con&s;ole me, by re|pre&s;enting, that Providence di&s;po&s;ed every thing for the be&s;t, even in our calamities; that my mother had fulfilled the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned her in this world, the educa|tion of her child; and that, &s;ince heaven had decreed I &s;hould lo&s;e one of my parents, it was better the one &s;hould remain who could be mo&s;t u&s;eful to my fortune. My lo&s;s was certainly irreparable, even in that re&s;pect, as the event fully proved; but I did not then make the reflection: I only felt the inefficien|cy of this pretended con&s;olation, &s;o little adapted to my way of thinking; and mea&s;ured, perhaps, for the fir&s;t time, the di&s;tance that &s;eparated my father from my&s;elf. It &s;eemed as if he was tearing away the reverential veil, under which I had hitherto con|&s;idered him: I found my&s;elf completely an orphan, &s;ince my mother was gone, and my father could ne|ver under&s;tand me: a new kind of grief oppre&s;&s;ed my afflicted heart: and I fell again into the deepe&s;t de&s;pair. The tears, however, of my con&s;in, and the &s;orrow of my worthy relations, &s;till offered me occa&s;ions of tender emotion; they had their effect, and I was &s;natched from the dangers that threatened my exi&s;tence. Why, alas! at that period did it not

terminate? It was my fir&s;t affliction; by how many others has it been followed?</P>
<P>HERE concludes the &s;erene and &s;plendid era of that tranquil life, pa&s;&s;ed in peace and in the enjoy|ment of bli&s;sful affections and beloved occupations, and re&s;embling the beautiful mornings of &s;pring, when the &s;erenity of the &s;ky, the purity of the air, the verdure of the foliage, and the fragrance of plants and flowers, enchant all animated nature, develope exi&s;tence, and confer happine&s;s by promi&s;ing it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Pri&s;on of St. Pelagie,
<DATE>Aug. 9, 1793.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY mother was not more than fifty years of age when I was deprived of her in &s;o cruel a manner. An ab&s;ce&s;s in her head, which proceeded from an unknown cau&s;e, and which was only di&s;covered by a di&s;charge from her no&s;e and ears that took place at her death, accounted for the &s;trange ob&s;truction of the re&s;piratory pa&s;&s;ages, with which &s;he had been &s;o long afflicted: but for this incidental di&s;ea&s;e, it is pro|bable that the &s;econd &s;troke of the pal&s;y would not have been attended with fatal con&s;equences. Her cheer|ful countenance and fre&s;h complexion did not an|nounce &s;o untimely a death; her ailments appeared to be tho&s;e of a time of life which women &s;eldom attain without &s;uffering a con&s;iderable change of con&s;titution;
<PB N="2" REF="034483_0566_0FFDEE02427ADF58">
and the melancholy, and even the de&s;pondency that I had remarked for &s;ome time before, were &s;ufficiently accounted for by moral cau&s;es, of which I was but too well aware.</P>
<P>OUR la&s;t excur&s;ions into the country &s;eemed to have given her new life: the very day &s;he was torn from me I had left her in good health at three in the afternoon: I returned at half pa&s;t five&mdash;the hand of death was already upon her, and at midnight &s;he was no more. Poor playthings of unpitying fate! why are &s;enti|ments &s;o lively, and &s;uch momentous projects, at|tached to an exi&s;tence &s;o frail?</P>
<P>THUS was &s;natched from the world one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t amiable women that ever inhabited it. No|thing brilliant rendered her remarkable, but every thing tended to endear her the moment &s;he was known. Naturally wi&s;e and good, virtue did not &s;eem to co&s;t her any effort; &s;he found means to ren|der it amiable and gentle, like her&s;elf. Prudent, calm, and tender-hearted, without being &s;ubject to any exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility, her pure and tranquil &s;pirit pur&s;ued its even cour&s;e like the docile &s;tream that bathes with equal gentlene&s;s the foot of the rock which holds it captive, and the valley which at once it enriches and adorns. Her &s;udden death made me experience the mo&s;t heart-rending pangs, and mo&s;t violent tran&s;ports of grief.</P>
<P>'IT is a good thing to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;en&s;ibility; it is un|fortunate to have &s;o much of it,' &s;aid, mournfully at

my &s;ide, the Abb&eacute; Legrand, who came to &s;ee me at the hou&s;e of my aged relations. When I began to recover, they ha&s;tened to invite, and to receive in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the different per&s;ons with whom I was ac|quainted, on purpo&s;e to familiarize me with exter|nal objects. I &s;eemed not to exi&s;t in that world where I was placed: ab&s;orbed by my &s;orrow, I &s;carcely perceived what was pa&s;&s;ing around me. I did not &s;peak, or, if I did, my replying to my own thoughts, in&s;tead of attending to tho&s;e of others, made me ap|pear like a di&s;tracted creature. Then again the be|loved image which was always pre&s;ent to my mind, recalling by &s;tarts the dreadful idea of my lo&s;s, &s;udden &s;hrieks e&s;caped me, my out-&s;tretched arms &s;tiffened, and I fainted away.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH incapable of any application, I had lu|cid intervals, in which I perceived the &s;orrow of my relations, their affection, and the kind attentions of my cou&s;in; and in which I tried all I could to dimini&s;h their anxiety. The Abb&eacute; Legrand, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;aga|city enough to judge that it was nece&s;&s;ary to talk to me a great deal concerning my mother, in order to ren|der me capable of thinking of any thing el&s;e. Ac|cordingly he conver&s;ed with me about her, and led me in&s;en&s;ibly to reflections and ideas, which, with|out being foreign to the &s;ubject, bani&s;hed the habit|ual recollection of my lo&s;s. As &s;oon as he believed me &s;ufficiently recovered to look at a book, he con|ceived the idea of bringing me the H&eacute;loi&s;e of <HI>Jean
<PB N="4" REF="034483_0568_0FFDEE07CEA41BA0">
Jaques Rou&s;&s;eau</HI>; and the peru&s;al of it was in truth the fir&s;t alleviation of my &s;orrow. I was then twenty-one years of age: I had read a great deal; I was ac|quainted with a con&s;iderable number of writers, hi&s;|torians, learned men, and philo&s;ophers: but Rou&s;|&s;eau made an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind &s;imilar to that which Plutarch had done when I was eight years old. It appeared that this was the intellectual food that &s;uited me, and the interpreter of ideas which I entertained before; but which he alone had the art of explaining to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH had prepared me to become a republi|can; he had called forth that vigour and elevation of mind which con&s;titute the character; and had in&s;pired me with a real enthu&s;ia&s;m in favour of freedom and of public virtue. Rou&s;&s;eau pointed out the dome&s;tic happine&s;s to which I had a right to a&s;pire, and the in|effable enjoyments which I was capable of ta&s;ting. Ah! while able to put me more effectually upon my guard again&s;t what is called an <HI>indi&s;cretion,</HI> why was it not al&s;o in his power to protect me again&s;t a &s;erious attachment? I brought into that corrupt world in which I was doomed to live, and into the revolution which I was then far from fore&s;eeing, a mind &s;tored long beforehand with all that could render me capa|ble of great &s;acrifices, and expo&s;e me to great mis|fortunes. Death will only be the period of both. I expect it, and I &s;hould not have thought of filling
<PB N="5" REF="034483_0569_0FFDEE0A794D99F8">
up the &s;hort interval which &s;eparates us, with the re|cital of my own &s;tory; if calumny had not dragged me forward on the &s;tage, on purpo&s;e to make a more cruel attack upon tho&s;e whom &s;he &s;eeks to ruin. I take a plea&s;ure in publi&s;hing truths that intere&s;t not my&s;elf alone; and am determined not to conceal a &s;ingle fact, that their connection may &s;erve to give them demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>I DID not return to my father's without experien|cing the &s;en&s;ations always in&s;pired by the &s;ight of tho&s;e places which we have been accu&s;tomed to inhabit in company with friends who are no more. The ill|judged precaution of removing my mother's portrait had been taken, as if the vacancy were not more calculated than the picture it&s;elf to awaken a pain|ful recollection of my lo&s;s. I in&s;tantly demanded it, and it was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>DOMESTIC cares devolving entirely on me, I made them my occupation; but they were not very nu|merous in a family con&s;i&s;ting of only three per&s;ons. I never could comprehend how the attention of a woman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es method and activity, can be engro&s;&s;ed by them, let her hou&s;ehold be as con&s;ider|able as it may: for &s;uppo&s;ing it great, there is a great number of per&s;ons to take part of them off her hands; and nothing is wanting but a proper di&s;tri|bution of employments, and a &s;mall &s;hare of vigi|lance. In the different &s;ituations of the kind, in which I have found my&s;elf, nothing has ever been
<PB N="6" REF="034483_0570_0FFDEE0E4B44E728">
done but by my orders; and yet when tho&s;e cares gave me the mo&s;t occupation, they &s;carcely ever con|&s;umed more than two hours a day. People who know how to employ them&s;elves, always find lei&s;ure moments, while tho&s;e who do nothing are in want of time for every thing. Be&s;ides, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the women who pay or receive u&s;ele&s;s vi&s;its, or who think them&s;elves badly dre&s;&s;ed, if they have not devoted a great deal of time to their toilet, &s;hould find the days long and tire&s;ome, and at the &s;ame time too &s;hort for the performance of their duties; but I have &s;een what are termed notable women, ren|dered in&s;upportable to the world, and even to their hu&s;bands, by a fatiguing pre-occupation about their trifling concerns. I know nothing &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting as this ridiculous conduct, nor &s;o well calculated to render a man attached to any other woman rather than to his wife. She mu&s;t, no doubt, appear to him a fit per&s;on for his hou&s;ekeeper: but is not likely to cure him of the de&s;ire of &s;eeking more ami|able accompli&s;hments el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>I THIN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that a wife &s;hould keep the linen and clothes in order, or cau&s;e them &s;o to be kept, &s;uckle her children, give directions concerning the cookery, or &s;uperintend it her&s;elf, but without &s;aying a word about it, and with &s;uch a command of temper and &s;uch a management of her time, as may leave her the means of talking of other matters, and of plea&s;ing no le&s;s by her good humour, than by the graces natural
<PB N="7" REF="034483_0571_0FFDEE0FD8915A38">
to her &s;ex. I have already had occa&s;ion to remark, that it is nearly the &s;ame in the government of &s;tates as of families. Tho&s;e famous hou&s;ewives who are al|ways expatiating on their labours, are &s;ure either to leave much in arrears, or to render them&s;elves tire|&s;ome to every one around them; and in like manner tho&s;e men in power, &s;o talkative and &s;o full of bu&s;ine&s;s, only make a mighty bu&s;tle about the dif|ficulties they are in, becau&s;e too awkward and too ig|norant to remove them.</P>
<P>MY &s;tudies became dearer to me than ever, and con&s;tituted my con&s;olation. Left alone &s;till more than ever, and often in a melancholy humour, I found my|&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of writing. I was fond of rendering an account of my own ideas to my&s;elf, and the intervention of my pen a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in putting them in order. When I did not employ it, I was rather lo&s;t in reveries than engaged in meditation; but with my pen I kept my imagination within bounds, and pur|&s;ued a regular chain of rea&s;oning. I had already be|gun to make &s;ome collections, which I have &s;ince aug|mented, and entitled, 'The Works of Lei&s;ure Hours, and various Reflections.' I had nothing further in view than to fix my opinions, and to have witne&s;&s;es of my &s;entiments, when on &s;ome future day I might con|front them with one another, &s;o that their gradations or their changes might &s;erve me at once as a le&s;&s;on and a record. I have a pretty large packet of the&s;e juvenile works piled up in the du&s;ty corner of my
<PB N="8" REF="034483_0572_0FFDEE1182BCCA58">
library, or perhaps in a garret. Never, however, did I feel the &s;malle&s;t temptation to become an author: I perceived at a very early period, that a woman who acquires the title lo&s;es far more than &s;he gains. She forfeits the affection of the male &s;ex, and provokes the critici&s;m of her own. If her works be bad, &s;he is ridiculed, and not without rea&s;on; if good, her right to them is di&s;puted; or if envy be forced to acknowledge the be&s;t part to be her own, her charac|ter, her morals, her conduct, and her talents, are &s;crutinized in &s;uch a manner that the reputation of her genius is fully counterbalanced by the publicity given to her defects.</P>
<P>BESIDES, my happine&s;s was my chief concern; and I never &s;aw the public intermeddle with that of any one without marring it. I know nothing &s;o agreeable as to be rated at our full worth by the people with whom we live; nor any thing &s;o empty as the admi|ration of a few per&s;ons whom we are never likely to meet again.</P>
<P>AH, my God! what an injury was done me by tho&s;e who took upon them to withdraw the veil under which I wi&s;hed to lie concealed! During twelve years of my life I &s;hared in my hu&s;band's labours as I participated in his repa&s;ts, becau&s;e one was as natural to me as the other. If any part of his works happened to be quoted, in which parti|cular graces of &s;tyle were di&s;covered; or if a flat|tering reception was given to any of the academic
<PB N="9" REF="034483_0573_0FFDEE166F1D62D8">
trifles, that he took a plea&s;ure in tran&s;mitting to the learned &s;ocieties, of which he was a member; I par|took of his &s;atisfaction, without remarking that it was my own compo&s;ition; and not unfrequently he brought him&s;elf to believe that he had been in a happier di&s;po&s;ition that u&s;ual when he had written a pa&s;&s;age, which in reality proceeded from <HI>my</HI> pen. If, during his admini&s;tration, an occa&s;ion occurred for the expre&s;&s;ion of great and &s;triking truths, I poured forth my whole &s;oul upon the paper; and it was but natural that its effu&s;ions &s;hould be preferable to the laborious teemings of a &s;ecretary's brain. I loved my country; I was an enthu&s;ia&s;t in the cau&s;e of liberty; I was unacquainted with any intere&s;t or any pa&s;&s;ions that could enter into competition with that enthu&s;ia&s;m; my language con&s;equently could not but be pure and pathetic, as it was that of the heart and of truth.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;o taken up with the importance of my &s;ub|ject, that I had not a thought to throw away upon my&s;elf. Once only I was diverted by a curious co|incidence of circum&s;tances: That was while writing to the pope, to claim the French arti&s;ts impri&s;oned at Rome. A letter to the pope, in the name of the Executive Council of France, &s;ketched &s;ecretly by the hand of a woman, in the humble clo&s;et, which Marat was plea&s;ed to term a <HI>boudoir</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A private apartment decked out with all the refinements of A&s;i|atic luxury, and con&s;ecrated to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, appeared to me
<PB N="10" REF="034483_0574_0FFDEE17F9540A68">
&s;o &s;trange a thing, that I laughed heartily after I had fini&s;hed it. The plea&s;ure of tho&s;e contra&s;ts con&s;i&s;ted in their &s;ecrecy; but that was nece&s;&s;arily le&s;s attainable in a &s;ituation which was no longer that of a private in|dividual, and where the eye of a clerk &s;urveys the hand|writing he is copying. There is nothing &s;ingular how|ever in all this, unle&s;s it be its novelty. Why &s;hould not a woman act as &s;ecretary to her hu&s;band without depriving him of any portion of his merit? It is well known that mini&s;ters cannot do everything them&s;elves; and &s;urely, if the wives of tho&s;e of the old government, or even of the new, had been capable of making draughts of letters, of official di&s;patches, or of pro|clamations, their time would have been better employ|ed in &s;o doing, than in &s;oliciting and intriguing fir&s;t for one <HI>friend,</HI> and then for another: the one excludes the other by the very nature of things. If tho&s;e who found me out had formed a right judgment of things, they would have &s;aved me from a &s;ort of celebrity, to which I never a&s;pired: in&s;tead of now &s;pending my time in refuting fal&s;ehood, I &s;hould be reading a chap|ter of Montaigne, painting a flower, or playing an ariette; and &s;hould thus beguile the &s;olitude of my pri|&s;on, without &s;itting down to write my confe&s;&s;ion. But I am anticipating a period which I had not as yet attained; I remark it without con&s;traint, as I have done it without &s;cruple: &s;ince I am the per&s;on to be de&s;cribed, it is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould be exhi|bited with all my irregularities. I do not conduct

my pen, it carries me along with it wherever it plea&s;es, and I let it have its own way.</P>
<P>MY father &s;eriou&s;ly endeavoured, in the early part of his widowhood, to remain more at home than hitherto; but he was attacked by <HI>ennui:</HI> and when once the love of his profe&s;&s;ion proved in&s;ufficient to prevent that di&s;temper of the mind, it was not at all &s;urpri&s;ing that my efforts to cure it &s;hould be of no avail. I wi&s;hed to conver&s;e with him, but we had few ideas in common, and it is probable that he al|ready inclined to a &s;pecies of di&s;cour&s;e in which he would not have wi&s;hed to &s;ee me an adept. I often engaged him in a game of piquet, but a game of pi|quet with his daughter was hardly intere&s;ting enough to keep him awake; be&s;ides, he well knew that cards were my aver&s;ion, and in &s;pite of my de&s;ire to per|&s;uade him that they afforded me entertainment, and in &s;pite of my endeavours <HI>really</HI> to reli&s;h the plea&s;ure of amu&s;ing him, he per&s;i&s;ted in con&s;idering my play|ing as the mere effect of complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>I COULD have wi&s;hed to render his home agreeable to him; but the means were not in my power. My only acquaintances were my aged relations, whom we &s;ometimes went to &s;ee, but who never &s;tirred out of doors.

<P>THERE is &s;uch a connexion between the evils which nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from a fir&s;t cau&s;e, that it al|ways behoves us to revert to that original mi&s;chief to account for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE legi&s;lators of the pre&s;ent day endeavour to form a general good, whence the happine&s;s of each individual is to &s;pring; but I am greatly afraid that this is putting the cart before the hor&s;e. It would be more conformable to nature, and perhaps to rea&s;on, to &s;tudy well what con&s;titutes dome&s;tic happi|ne&s;s, and to en&s;ure it to individuals in &s;uch a way that the common felicity &s;hould be compo&s;ed of that of each citizen, and that all &s;hould be intere&s;ted in pre&s;erving an order of things, to which &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings would be due. However &s;pecious the written principles of a con&s;titution may be, if I be|hold a portion of tho&s;e who have adopted it im|mer&s;ed in grief and tears, I &s;hall con&s;ider it as no bet|ter than a political mon&s;ter; and if tho&s;e who do not weep, rejoice in the &s;ufferings of the re&s;t, I &s;hall &s;ay that it is atrocious, and that its authors are either weak or wicked men.</P>

the virtue of one of them may maintain order and peace; but the want of happine&s;s will be experienced &s;ooner or later, and produce inconveniences more or le&s;s to be deplored. The fabric of &s;uch unions re|&s;embles the &s;y&s;tem of our modern politicians&mdash;it is de|fective at the ba&s;e, and &s;ome day or other mu&s;t needs tumble to the ground, in &s;pite of the art employed in its con&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons whom my mother would have natural|ly collected around her, would have been &s;uch as re|&s;embled her&s;elf; and the&s;e would not have tallied with the temper of my father; while, on the other hand, tho&s;e whom he would have wi&s;hed to receive as daily vi&s;itors, would not only have been di&s;agreeable to my mother, but incompatible with the manner in which &s;he wi&s;hed to bring me up. It therefore behoved her to confine her&s;elf to her own family, and to cultivate only tho&s;e &s;light connexions which produce an acquaintance without creating an intimacy.</P>
<P>EVERY thing went on well, while my father, with an agreeable profe&s;&s;ion and a young wife, found all the employment and all the plea&s;ure that were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to his happine&s;s within his own walls. But he was a year younger than my mother; &s;he began early in life to experience infirmities; various cir|cum&s;tances combined to damp his ardour for la|bour; and the de&s;ire of getting rich made him em|bark in &s;everal hazardous enterpri&s;es:&mdash;from that moment all was lo&s;t.

<P>BECOME a widower at the very period when he &s;tood in need of new chains to attach him to his home, my poor father kept a mi&s;tre&s;s, that he might not pre&s;ent his daughter with a mother-in-law; he gamed, to in|demnify him&s;elf for his lo&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s, and for his expences; and though &s;till an hone&s;t man, and &s;till fearful of wronging any one, he contrived to ruin him|&s;elf by in&s;en&s;ible degrees.</P>
<P>MY relations, who were plain hone&s;t people, little ver&s;ed in pecuniary matters, and who confided in my father's fondne&s;s for his daughter, had neglected to demand an inventory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In France there was generally a clau&s;e in the marriage con|tract, by which the hu&s;band engaged to pre&s;erve his wife's fortune, and all her <HI>per&s;onal effects,</HI> for her children, or to re&s;tore them to her relations in ca&s;e &s;he left no i&s;&s;ue.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE> at the death of his wife; my intere&s;t appeared to be perfectly &s;afe in his hands: and they would have thought &s;uch a reque&s;t an injury to his honour.

<P><PB N="15" REF="034483_0579_0FFDEE259CC5F398">I WAS now become &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, and divided my time between my dome&s;tic occupations and my &s;tudies, which I &s;ometimes quitted to give an&s;wers to tho&s;e who were vexed at finding my father &s;o fre|quently from home.

<P>OUR &s;ervant, a little woman, fifty-five years of age, thin, alert, lively and gay, was extremely at|tached to me, becau&s;e I rendered her life comforta|ble.

<P><PB REF="034483_0580_0FFDEE2739396A00">I WISHED to go through a cour&s;e of preachers, living and dead, the eloquence of the pulpit being of &s;uch a nature, as to enable great talents to di&s;play them|&s;elves in all their &s;plendour. I had already read Bo&s;|&s;uet and Flechier; I took a plea&s;ure in reading them again with a more experienced eye, and made an ac|quaintance with Bourdaloue and Ma&s;&s;illon. It was highly whim&s;ical to &s;ee tho&s;e pious per&s;onages mar|&s;halled on my little &s;helves in the &s;ame line with <HI>The Sy&s;tem of Nature,</HI> Raynal and De Pauw; but a thing &s;till more &s;o was, that by dint of reading &s;ermons, the whim took me of writing one my&s;elf. I was vexed at our preachers always recurring to my&s;teries; it &s;eemed to me that they ought to have compo&s;ed mo|ral di&s;cour&s;es, in which the devil and the incarnation &s;hould have been left totally out of the que&s;tion: I therefore took up my pen to try what work I could make of it, and wrote a &s;ermon on <HI>brotherly love.</HI> It &s;erved to amu&s;e my little uncle, who was become a canon of Vincennes, and who &s;aid it was a pity that I had not thought of that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition at the time he was obliged to deliver di&s;cour&s;es from the pul|pit, as in that ca&s;e he would certainly have made u&s;e of mine.</P>
<P>I HAD often heard the logic of Bourdaloue highly extolled: I ventured however in &s;ome mea&s;ure to differ from his admirers, and actually wrote a cri|tici&s;m on one of his mo&s;t e&s;teemed di&s;cour&s;es; but I &s;hewed it to no one. I was fond of rendering an
<PB N="17" REF="034483_0581_0FFDEE2C2F486E60">
account of my opinions to my&s;elf, without feeling the &s;malle&s;t wi&s;h to make a di&s;play of my learning before any per&s;on whatever. Ma&s;&s;illon, le&s;s lofty than Bourdaloue, and far more affecting, obtained the tri|bute of my prai&s;e. I was not then acquainted with the Prote&s;tant preachers, among whom Blair in par|ticular has cultivated with equal &s;implicity and ele|gance that kind of pulpit oratory, of which I con|ceived the exi&s;tence, and which I could have wi&s;hed to &s;ee in vogue.</P>
<P>AS to the preachers of my own time, I heard the Abb&eacute; l'Enfant, towards the end of his be&s;t days; po|litene&s;s and rea&s;on appeared to me his leading charac|teri&s;tics. Father Eliz&eacute;e was already out of fa&s;hion, notwith&s;tanding his excellent logic and the purity of his diction: his mind was too metaphy&s;ical, and his delivery too &s;imple, to captivate the vulgar for any length of time.</P>
<P>PARIS in tho&s;e days was a &s;ingular place: that common &s;ewer of all the impurities of the kingdom, was al&s;o the focus of ta&s;te and knowledge: preacher or comedian, profe&s;&s;or or mountebank, whoever in &s;hort po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abilities, was &s;ure to find followers in his turn; but the fir&s;t abilities in the univer&s;e could not long fix the public attention, for which novelty was always nece&s;&s;ary, and which was attracted by noi&s;e no le&s;s than by merit. A certain Ex-Je&s;uit, who was become a mi&s;&s;ionary, and made a parade of his going to court, &s;ucceeded by tho&s;e means in obtain|ing
<PB N="18" REF="034483_0582_1000F6AF84C96338">
great popular applau&s;e. I went al&s;o to hear the Abb&eacute; de Beauregard: he was a little man, with a powerful voice, who declaimed with uncommon impu|dence, and with a vehemence equally extraordinary, retailing common-place ob&s;ervations in a tone of in|&s;piration, and &s;upporting them by ge&s;tures &s;o terrible, that he per&s;uaded a great number of people they were the fine&s;t things in the world. I did not then perceive, as experience has taught me &s;ince, that men, a&s;&s;em|bled in great numbers, rather po&s;&s;e&s;s long ears than great judgment; that to a&s;toni&s;h is to &s;educe them; and that whoever a&s;&s;umes the authority of command|ing, di&s;po&s;es them to obey; nor could I find utter|ance for my a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ucce&s;s of this per&s;o|nage, who was either a great fanatic, or a great rogue, or perhaps both. I had not &s;ufficiently analy|&s;ed the circum&s;tances accompanying the harangues de|livered from the tribunes of the ancient republics; if I had, I &s;hould have formed a better judgment con|cerning the means of working upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the people. But I &s;hall never forget a low fellow who &s;tood directly oppo&s;ite the pulpit in which Beauregard was acting the po&s;ture-ma&s;ter, with his eyes fixed on the orator, his mouth open, and involuntarily ex|pre&s;&s;ing his &s;tupid admiration in the three following words, which I perfectly recollect: 'How he &s;weats!' Such then are the means of impo&s;ing upon the igno|rant! and how much was Pochion in the right, when, &s;urpri&s;ed at finding him&s;elf applauded in an a&s;&s;embly

<P>WHAT an admirable <HI>clubbi&s;t</HI> would this M. de Beau|regard have made; and how many members of the popular &s;ocieties, in their enthu&s;ia&s;m for brazen-faced babblers, have recalled to my mind the expre&s;|&s;ion of the man above-mentioned: '<HI>How he &s;weats!</HI>'</P>
<P>THE danger I had been in had made &s;ome noi&s;e; it &s;hould &s;eem that it was con&s;idered either as very un|common, or very meritorious, in a young woman to endanger her own life by her exce&s;&s;ive &s;orrow at her mother's death. I received many marks of regard on this occa&s;ion, which were extremely grateful to me. One of the fir&s;t who be&s;towed them, was M. de Boi&s;morel, whom I had not &s;een &s;ince his vi&s;its to my grandmother. I perceived the impre&s;&s;ion made upon him by the change that had taken place in my per&s;on &s;ince that period. He returned at a time when I was ab&s;ent, and held a long conference with my father, who no doubt mentioned my &s;tudies, and &s;hewed him the little apartment in which I pa&s;&s;ed my time: he looked at my books; my <HI>works</HI> were upon the table; they excited his curio&s;ity: and my father en|abled him to gratify it, by putting them into his hands.</P>
<P>GREAT was my di&s;plea&s;ure, and heavy were my complaints, when I found, on my return, that my a&s;ylum had been violated. My father indeed a&s;&s;ured me that he &s;hould never have done &s;uch a thing for a

But the mi&s;chief was already done, and the next day I received a very hand&s;ome letter from M. de Boi&s;morel, couched in terms too flattering not to procure his pardon for having availed him&s;elf of my father's indi&s;cretion, and making me an offer of every thing his library contained. I did not receive it with indifference; from that moment we commenced a corre&s;pondence, and for the fir&s;t time in my life I enjoyed upon re|flection, all the plea&s;ure which &s;en&s;ibility and &s;elf love make us feel when we find our&s;elves prized by tho&s;e on who&s;e judgment we &s;et a value.</P>
<P>M. DE BOISMOREL no longer re&s;ided within the walls of Paris; his partiality for the country, and his wi&s;h not to remove his mother to too great a di&s;tance from the capital, had made him purcha&s;e <HI>Le Petit Bercy,</HI> a charming hou&s;e, &s;ituated a little below Charenton, and of which the garden extend|ed to the banks of the Seine. He pre&s;&s;ed us much to take it in our walks, and te&s;tified the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire to receive us there. Recollecting the recep|tion formerly given me by his mother, I did not feel inclined to encounter it again, and long re&s;i&s;ted my father's entreaties. He in&s;i&s;ted however; and as I
<PB N="21" REF="034483_0585_1000F6B107478A68">
did not wi&s;h to object to the little parties he &s;ome|times took it in his head to propo&s;e to me, we &s;et off one day for Bercy, and found the ladies of the Boi&s;morel family &s;itting together in the &s;ummer par|lour. The pre&s;ence of the daughter-in-law, who&s;e ami|able di&s;po&s;ition I had heard highly extolled, in&s;pired me all at once with that mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance, which was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to prevent any alteration from taking place in mine. The mother, who&s;e haughty tone my reader will remember, and to whom increa&s;ing years had brought no increa&s;e of humility, behaved notwith|&s;tanding, with much greater politene&s;s to a young woman who &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of her own importance, than &s;he had done to the child whom &s;he con&s;idered as utterly in&s;ignificant. What a fine girl your daugh|ter is, M. Phlipon! Why, do you know that my &s;on is quite enchanted with her? Pray tell me, Mademoi&s;elle, don't you think of getting a hu&s;band?&mdash;There are people, Madam, who have already thought for me upon the &s;ubject; but as to my&s;elf, I have not yet met with &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to induce me to change my &s;ituation. You are very difficult, I fancy! Pray, &s;hould you have any objection to a middle-aged man? An acquaintance with the per&s;on could alone deter|mine my con&s;ent, my repugnance, or my di&s;like. Matches of that &s;ort are generally productive of the mo&s;t la&s;ting happine&s;s; a young man often goes a&s;tray, even when we think him the mo&s;t attached to us.&mdash; And why, mother, &s;aid M. de Boi&s;morel, who was ju&s;t come into the room, would not you wi&s;h the young

lady to believe her&s;elf capable of captivating him en|tirely?&mdash;She is dre&s;&s;ed with a great deal of ta&s;te, &s;aid Madame de Boi&s;morel to her daughter-in-law.&mdash;Ah! very well indeed, and with &s;o much decency! replied the young woman, with that gentle tone of voice peculiar to devotees; for &s;he was of that de&s;cription, and the little wings of her cap brought forward over an agree|able face, that had &s;een thirty-four &s;ummers, were in the &s;tyle of that religious character. How different, continued &s;he, from the paltry feathers of giddy-headed girls! You don't love feathers, do you, Ma|demoi&s;elle?&mdash;I never wear any, Madam, becau&s;e it &s;eems to me that they would announce a condition in life, and a fortune, that do not belong to an arti&s;t's daughter going about on foot.&mdash;But would you wear them if you were in a different &s;ituation?&mdash;I do not know; I attach little importance to &s;uch trifles. I only con&s;ider what is &s;uitable to my&s;elf, and &s;hould be very &s;orry to judge of others from the &s;uperficial information afforded by their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer was &s;evere, but its point was blunted by the &s;oft tone of voice in which it was pronounced. A philo&s;opher! &s;aid the young lady, with a &s;igh, as if &s;he had di&s;covered that I was not one of her way of thinking.</P>
<P>AFTER a &s;crupulous examination of my per&s;on, mingled with a great number of fine things like tho&s;e I have ju&s;t related, M. de Boi&s;morel put an end to the inventory of my charms, by propo&s;ing a vi&s;it to
<PB N="23" REF="034483_0587_0FFDEE35DA07AA70">
the garden and the library. I admired the &s;ituation of the former, where he made me remark a fine cedar of Lebanon; I viewed the library with an eye of inter|e&s;t, and pointed out the books, and even the collections that I wi&s;hed him to lend me; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as <HI>Bayle,</HI> and the tran&s;actions of the different academies of &s;ciences. From the ladies we received an invitation to dinner on an appointed day, of which we availed our&s;elves; and I &s;oon perceived, by two or three men of bu&s;ine&s;s, who, with our&s;elves, made up the whole of the gue&s;ts, that care had been taken to provide fit company for my father, without attending to <HI>me.</HI> But M. de Boi&s;morel had recour&s;e, as before, to the li|brary and the garden, where the conver&s;ation took an agreeable turn. A part was borne in it by his &s;on, a young man of &s;eventeen, &s;ufficiently ugly, and of manners rather &s;ingular than agreeable. Nor did the fine company which came in the evening, and on which I ca&s;t an eye of ob&s;ervation, appear to me very engaging, in &s;pite of their titles: the daughters of a marquis, learned coun&s;ellors, a prior, and &s;everal an|tiquated dowagers, talked with more importance, but quite as in&s;ipidly as grey &s;i&s;ters, church-wardens, and &s;ober cits. The&s;e glimp&s;es which I &s;tole of the great world, di&s;gu&s;ted me with it, and attached me more than ever to my own way of life. M. de Boi&s;morel did not lo&s;e the opportunity, of keeping up a connex|ion, on which, perhaps, he grounded &s;ome project for the future: he &s;o managed matters, that the two fa|thers
<PB N="14" REF="034483_0588_0FFDEE39AC0EF228">
and the two children formed a di&s;tinct party. It was in this manner al&s;o that he carried me to the public a&s;&s;embly of the French academy, on the next anniver&s;ary of St. Louis. The&s;e a&s;&s;emblies were, at that time, the re&s;ort of the be&s;t company, and ex|hibited all tho&s;e ridiculous contra&s;ts, which our man|ners and our follies could not fail to produce. On the morning of St. Louis's day, high ma&s;s was chaunted in the chapel of the academy by the &s;ingers of the Opera, after which a fa&s;hionable preacher pronounced a pane|gyric on the fainted king. The Abb&eacute; de Be&s;plas per|formed the office; and I li&s;tened to him with great plea&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ubject was trite; for his di&s;cour&s;e was inter&s;per&s;ed with bold traits of phi|lo&s;ophy, and indirect &s;atire on the court, which he was obliged to cancel before he &s;ent his &s;ermon to the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>M. DE BOISMOREL, who was acquainted with him, was in hopes of obtaining a faithful copy, which he might communicate to me; but the Abb&eacute; de Be&s;|plas, who was attached to the court, in quality of chaplain to <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> thought him&s;elf very fortunate in purcha&s;ing a pardon for his audacity by the en|tire &s;acrifice of the pa&s;&s;ages it had in&s;pired. In the evening, the &s;itting of the academy opened a fine field for the fir&s;t wits in the kingdom, by virtue of the &s;eats they occupied; for the noblemen, who were proud of &s;eeing their names in&s;cribed on the li&s;t of members, and of exhibiting them&s;elves in
<PB N="25" REF="034483_0589_0FFDEE3B3B6DEDA0">
their arm-chairs; for the <HI>amateurs,</HI> who came to li&s;ten to the former, to gaze upon the latter, and to &s;hew them&s;elves to the whole a&s;&s;embly; and for the pretty women, who were &s;ure of attracting their atten|tion.</P>
<P>I TOOK particular notice of <HI>D'Alembert,</HI> who&s;e name, <HI>Mi&s;cellanies,</HI> and writings on the <HI>Encyclopedia,</HI> excited my curio&s;ity; his little face, and &s;queaking voice, made me think a philo&s;opher's works better worth contemplation than his per&s;on. The Abb&eacute; de Lille confirmed my remark as to men of letters, by reci|ting the mo&s;t charming ver&s;es in the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable tone. The panegyric of <HI>Catinat,</HI> by Laharpe, bore away the prize, and was highly de&s;erving of its &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>AS free from affectation at the academy as at church, and as I have ever remained at the theatre, I bore no part in the noi&s;y applau&s;e be&s;towed, with rapture, upon the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages, and not unfrequently with o&s;tentation on tho&s;e which every one wi&s;hed to have the credit of remarking. I was exceedingly attentive, li&s;tening without paying any regard to the ob&s;ervers; and when I was moved, I wept without even &s;u&s;pecting that my doing &s;o would appear &s;ingular to any one. I had rea&s;on howev|er to perceive that it was a novelty; for, on the breaking up of the a&s;&s;embly, while M. de Boi&s;morel was conducting me to the door, I &s;aw &s;everal per&s;ons pointing me out to one another with a &s;mile, which I
<PB N="26" REF="034483_0590_0FFDEE3DF035EB40">
was not vain enough to take for admiration, but in which there was nothing that indicated contempt; and I heard them &s;aying &s;omething about my &s;en&s;ibility. I experienced a mixed &s;entiment of &s;urpri&s;e and a|greeable confu&s;ion, which I cannot de&s;cribe; and was very happy when I was at la&s;t able to e&s;cape from their &s;ight, and from the crowd.</P>
<P>THE panegyric of Catinat &s;ugge&s;ted to M. de Boi&s;morel the idea of an intere&s;ting pilgrimage. He propo&s;ed to me to pay a vi&s;it to St. Gratien, where that great man ended his days in retirement, far from honours and the court. It was an excur&s;ion perfectly &s;uited to my ta&s;te. M. de Boi&s;morel came one Michaelmas day, with his &s;on, to call on my father and my&s;elf; and we all repaired together to the banks of the lake which embelli&s;hes the valley of Montmo|rency. From the lake we proceeded to St. Gratien, and re&s;ted our&s;elves in the &s;hade of the trees which Catinat planted with his own hands; and then, after a frugal dinner, returned to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the day in the delightful park of Montmorency, where we &s;aw the little hou&s;e that <HI>Jean Jaques</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rou&s;&s;eau.</NOTE> had inhabited, and enjoyed all the plea&s;ure afforded by a beautiful country to &s;everal per&s;ons who contemplate it with the &s;ame eye. After one of tho&s;e moments of repo&s;e, in which we con&s;ider the maje&s;ty of nature in &s;ilence, M. de Boi&s;morel took a paper, in his own hand-wri|ting,
<PB N="27" REF="034483_0591_0FFDEE40A09BABE8">
out of his pocket, and read to us an anecdote which he had copied, and which was then but little known. It was the trait of Monte&s;quieu, when di&s;|covered at Mar&s;eilles by a young man who&s;e father he had redeemed from flavery, endeavouring to e&s;cape from the thanks of tho&s;e whom he had obliged.</P>
<P>DEEPLY impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of Monte&s;quieu's genero&s;ity, I did not exclu&s;ively admire his ob&s;tinacy in denying that he was the adored deliverer of a fa|mily tran&s;ported with joy: the generous man does not look for acknowledgments; but however noble it may be to decline the te&s;timonies of gratitude, it is not le&s;s the part of a great mind to receive its effu&s;ions. I even think it is a new obligation con|ferred on people of &s;en&s;ibility, to whom we have been of &s;ervice; for it is to them a way of di&s;charg|ing their debt.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not, however, be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I was perfectly at my ea&s;e in regard to the&s;e frequent meet|ings of my father and M. de Boi&s;morel: I &s;aw with &s;orrow that there were no points of re&s;emblance be|tween them. His &s;on looked at me a great deal; and did not plea&s;e me at all. I thought that his man|ner rather indicated curio&s;ity than affection; be&s;ides, the three or four years between his age and mine, placed us at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other. All this his father perceived, and I was afterwards told that he had one day &s;aid to mine, with an affec|tionate &s;queeze of the hand: Ah! if my child were

but worthy of yours: I might appear &s;ingular, but I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf one of the happie&s;t of man|kind!&mdash;I had no &s;u&s;picion of any thing of the &s;ort: I did not even calculate the di&s;tance between us; but I felt it, and it prevented any &s;uch idea from ri&s;ing in my mind. I looked upon M. de Boi&s;morel's conduct as that of a prudent and benevolent man, who hon|oured my &s;ex, felt particular e&s;teem for <HI>me,</HI> and, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, protected my inclinations. His corre&s;pondence re&s;embled him; its leading feature was a gentle gravity, and it bore the &s;tamp of re&s;|pectful friend&s;hip, and of a mind exalted above pre|judices. By his means I became acquainted with what were called the <HI>novelties (les nouveaut&eacute;s)</HI> of the learned and literary world. I &s;eldom &s;aw him, but I heard from him every week. To prevent the fre|quency of me&s;&s;ages by his &s;ervants to me, as well as to &s;ave me the expence of carriage from Bercy, he ordered the books intended for my peru&s;al to be left with the porter of his &s;i&s;ter, Madame de Fa|vieres, whither I u&s;ed to &s;end and fetch them. M. de Boi&s;morel, who had a great re&s;pect for the re|public of letters, and who fancied, in con&s;equence of his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my favour, that I might be u&s;efully employed in its &s;ervice, or el&s;e was de|&s;irous of putting me to a trial, advi&s;ed me to choo&s;e the line of literature that &s;uited me, and to &s;it down &s;eriou&s;ly to write. At fir&s;t I took it for a compliment; but by returning to the advice, he gave me an oppor|tunity

of &s;etting forth my principles on that &s;ubject, my well-founded aver&s;ion to coming forward in any manner on the theatre of the world, and my di&s;intere&s;t|ed love of &s;tudy, which I wi&s;hed to make in&s;trumental to my happine&s;s, without aiming at any kind of fame that might tend to di&s;turb it. After having &s;eriou&s;ly ex|hibited my doctrine, I changed the rea&s;oning into ver|&s;es, which flowed &s;pontaneou&s;ly from my pen, and of which the ideas were &s;uperior to the poetry.

<P><PB N="30" REF="034483_0594_0FFDEE708BD94F58">M. DE BOISMOREL an&s;wered me &s;ometimes in &s;imilar language, and in ver&s;es &s;carcely better than my own; but neither he nor I attached the &s;malle&s;t impor|tance to our poetical effu&s;ions. One day he came to con&s;ult me concerning the means of reviving his &s;on's application to his &s;tudies, which of late had &s;uffered con&s;iderable diminution.</P>
<P>THAT young man was naturally intimate with his contemporary, and fir&s;t cou&s;in, M. de Favieres, a coun&s;ellor in parliament at the age of twenty-one, who joined to the u&s;ual giddine&s;s of youth, all the confidence of a magi&s;trate, proud of his gown, with|out attending to his duties; and all the freedom of manners, perhaps even the licentiou&s;ne&s;s, of an only &s;on born to a con&s;iderable e&s;tate.</P>
<P>THE Italian theatre and the Opera employed the two cou&s;ins much more than <HI>Cujas</HI> and <HI>Bartole</HI> did the one, or the mathematics the other. I mu&s;t re|que&s;t you &s;aid, M. de Boi&s;morel, to write a &s;evere letter to my &s;on, in terms &s;en&s;ible and impre&s;&s;ive, &s;uch as

your mind cannot fail to &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;uch as may &s;erve to awaken his &s;elf-love, and in&s;pire him with generous re&s;olutions.&mdash;Who, <HI>I,</HI> Sir! Do you mean <HI>me?</HI> (I could &s;carcely believe my ears.) With what face, pray, can I preach to your &s;on?&mdash;You may adopt any mode you plea&s;e, with the certainty that your name &s;hall remain concealed. We will have the letter conveyed as if it came from a per&s;on who is in the habit of &s;eeing him, who is acquainted with his proceedings, and who warns him of the danger that awaits his &s;teps. I will take care to have it de|livered at a moment when it is likely to have its full effect: I only wi&s;h him not to &s;u&s;pect me of any hand in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and in due time will let him know to what phy&s;ician he is indebted for his cure.&mdash;Oh! be &s;ure you never mention my name!&mdash;but you certainly have friends who could do this better than I.&mdash;I think otherwi&s;e, and reque&s;t it of you as a favour.&mdash;Well, then, I will lay a&s;ide my &s;cruples, to prove to you my de&s;ire to oblige; and will make a rough draught, of which you &s;hall give me your opinion, and which I will beg you to correct.</P>
<P>THAT very evening I wrote a very pointed, and &s;omewhat ironical letter; &s;uch as I conceived calcu|lated to flatter the vanity, and to excite the thinking faculty of a youth, to whom it is nece&s;&s;ary to talk of his advantages when you wi&s;h to recall him to &s;e|rious occupations. M. de Boi&s;morel was delighted, and begged me to forward it without altering a word.
<PB N="32" REF="034483_0596_0FFDEE492F0BCED8">
I &s;ent it to Sophia, reque&s;ting her to put it into the po&s;t-office at Amiens, and waited with no &s;mall de|gree of impatience to know what effect my &s;ermon would produce.</P>
<P>M. DE BOISMOREL &s;oon wrote me an epi&s;tle con|taining particulars which intere&s;ted me exceedingly: he had brought together a number of circum&s;tances which rendered the thing infinitely &s;triking: the young man was affected; and fancying that the cele|brated Duclos was the author of the remon&s;trance, went to return him thanks: deceived in this conjec|ture, he next addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to another of his fa|ther's friends, and found that he was not at all nearer the mark. Study, however, in &s;ome degree re&s;umed her reign.</P>
<P>IT was not long after this tran&s;action that M. de Boi&s;morel, going with his &s;on from Bercy to Vin|cennes, where he knew I was on a vi&s;it to my uncle, and whither he was bringing me the <HI>Georgics,</HI> tran&s;|lated by the Abb&eacute; Delille, was &s;truck by a <HI>coup-de-&s;oleil.</HI> He made very light of it; but was &s;oon after taken ill with a headach, fir&s;t followed by a fever, and then by a lethargy; and died in the meridian of life, af|ter an illne&s;s of a few days. Scarcely eighteen months had elap&s;ed &s;ince we commenced our corre&s;pondence: I grieved for his death, I believe, more &s;incerely than his own &s;on; nor does his image ever revert to my mind without my feeling that painful regret, and that &s;entiment of veneration and concern, which accom|pany the remembrance of a virtuous man.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="034483_0597_0FFDEE4BE34BE380">WHEN my &s;orrow was a little allayed, I celebrated his memory in a monody, which no one ever &s;aw, which I &s;ung to my guitar, and which I have &s;ince forgotten, and lo&s;t. I never heard any thing far|ther of his family, unle&s;s that one day, when my fa|ther went to pay an occa&s;ional vi&s;it, the young de Boi&s;morel, who then bore the name of Roberge, told him in a very cavalier manner, that he had found my letters to his father, and thrown them by in a corner, in order to return them if required; and that among them he had di&s;covered the original of a certain epi&s;tle which he him&s;elf had formerly re|ceived. My father, who was well acquainted with all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and who made him little or no an&s;wer, perceived the young man was piqued; whence I concluded that he was a blockhead, and gave my|&s;elf no further concern about him: I do not know whether I gue&s;&s;ed aright.</P>
<P>SOME time after, Madam de Favieres came to my father to employ him in the purcha&s;e of &s;ome jewels, or in the execution of &s;ome work. I happened to be in my little cell, and could overhear all that was pa&s;|&s;ing in the next room. 'Your daughter is a charming girl, Mon&s;ieur Phlipon: my brother u&s;ed to &s;ay that &s;he was one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible women he ever met with in his life; take care, however, that &s;he does not &s;et up for a wit: that would be very &s;hocking in|deed. Does &s;he not, do you think, &s;eem a little of the pedant? 'Tis to be apprehended; and, if I mi&s;|take
<PB N="34" REF="034483_0598_0FFDEE6CB94C22F8">
not, I have heard &s;omething of the kind. She is a pretty-faced girl: a very good-looking girl indeed.' Upon my word, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, this is a very im|pertinent fine lady, and very like her mother: hea|ven defend me from ever &s;eeing her face, or &s;hewing her mine!</P>
<P>MY father, who knew very well I was within hearing, did not think proper to call me, &s;ince I did not choo&s;e to &s;hew my&s;elf; nor from that day to the pre&s;ent have I ever heard the voice of Madam de Fa|vieres.</P>
<P>HITHERTO I have &s;carcely mentioned my excellent cou&s;in Trude. She was one of tho&s;e kind &s;ouls, which heaven in its goodne&s;s formed for the honour of the human race, and the con&s;olation of the un|fortunate. Generous by nature, and amiable with|out art, I could never perceive any objection to her, but an exce&s;s of delicacy and virtuous pride. She would have thought her&s;elf defective in her duties, if &s;he had left room to doubt her having fulfilled them. That was preci&s;ely the way to become completely the victim of a whim&s;ical hu&s;band. Trude was a ru&s;tic, his ideas as extravagant as his temper was impetuous, and his behaviour brutal. He was engaged in the looking-gla&s;s trade, as all the Trudes have been, in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, for &s;everal generations. Of an active di&s;po&s;ition, labori|ous by fits, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the care and intelligence of an agreeable and prudent woman, he &s;ucceeded
<PB N="35" REF="034483_0599_0FFDEE7955C56CE0">
tolerably in bu&s;ine&s;s, and was indebted to his wife's merit for the kind countenance &s;hewn him by his own family, who would have &s;lighted him had he remained a &s;ingle man.</P>
<P>MY mother was very fond of her little cou&s;in, who held her in &s;ingular veneration, and was &s;trongly attached to me.</P>
<P>SHE proved it, as my reader has already &s;een, on the death of my mother: taken up in the day with her hou&s;ehold affairs, and her hu&s;band, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon being my nur&s;e during the night. She came from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance to perform the duties of a nur&s;e; nor had I any other as long as I continued in danger. That circum&s;tance naturally increa&s;ed our intimacy, and we &s;aw each other frequently. Her hu&s;band took it in his head to come &s;till more frequent|ly, unaccompanied by his wife. At fir&s;t I bore with him on her account, in &s;pite of his tire&s;ome conver|&s;ation; but at length he became in&s;upportable, and I made u&s;e of all the management nece&s;&s;ary with a wrong-headed man, to make him perceive that neither his quality of kin&s;man, nor that of hu&s;band to my much-beloved friend, could authorize &s;uch frequent vi&s;its which would at any rate have been improper in the &s;ickly and &s;uffering &s;tate, to which my &s;orrow had reduced me.</P>
<P>MY dear cou&s;in came le&s;s frequently, but he made tedious vi&s;its of three or four hours, notwith&s;tanding my employing my&s;elf con&s;tantly, and even writing, to
<PB N="36" REF="034483_0600_0FFDEE746522C660">
make him under&s;tand that I was in ha&s;te; and when I begged him in plain terms to retire, as I was at la&s;t forced to do, he went home in &s;uch a humour, and be|haved &s;o ill to his wife, &s;he entreated me to exert my pa|tience for the &s;ake of her dome&s;tic peace. On Sundays and holydays particularly, I was doomed to do penance: when the weather was fine I e&s;caped, and appointed a meeting with his wife at the hou&s;e of my aged relations; &s;ince the receiving her at home for a &s;hort time in his company, was not &s;eeing her, but being a witne&s;s to the brutal behaviour of her &s;urly hu&s;band. In the winter I managed another way: I gave a holyday to the maid, who locked, barred, and bolted every door; and I remained alone and quiet till eight o'clock at night. Trude came; could make nobody hear, came again, and &s;ometimes walked for two or three hours round the hou&s;e in the &s;now or rain, waiting for the moment of admi&s;&s;ion. To conceal my&s;elf when I was really there in company with any one, was almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible; and po&s;itively to forbid him the hou&s;e by pre|vailing on my father to break off all connexion with this curious per&s;onage (which would have been diffi|cult, becau&s;e he had no children, and my father thought it prudent to pre&s;erve his good opinion), would have been coming to that extremity which his wife dreaded, would have put an end to our intimacy, and would have expo&s;ed her to further afflictions.</P>
<P>I KNOW nothing wor&s;e than to have connexions with a madman: there is no way of dealing with him but
<PB N="37" REF="034483_0601_0FFDEE6A0D8F5810">
by means of a &s;trait wai&s;tcoat; every thing el&s;e is of no avail. This brutal cou&s;in was a plague to me, and I know nothing that can better prove the merit of his wife, than my refraining from having him thrown out of the window; but he would have re|turned by the chimney. To do him ju&s;tice, however, Trude was not without a certain &s;ort of politene&s;s&mdash; rather a madman than a fool, he gave rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e he knew how far he could carry his extravagance with impunity; for his coar&s;e conver&s;ation was never indecent, and though for ever at variance with good breeding and rationality, he never offended again&s;t mode&s;ty, or wounded the mo&s;t delicate ear. When his wife was walking with he watched us, and if we were acco&s;ted or &s;aluted by any man, he became unea&s;y and furious till he found who it was. It will be imagined, perhaps, he was jealous of his wife, and that was in &s;ome degree true; but he was ten times more &s;o on my account. In &s;pite of &s;o tormenting a life, Madam Trude's gentlene&s;s was not unaccom|panied by gaiety; and &s;he would pa&s;s one day in weep|ing, and the next in making merry with her friends.</P>
<P>IT was her cu&s;tom to give family entertainments, which were followed by a dance, once or twice during the winter &s;ea&s;on. Her cou&s;in was always the hero|ine of the fe&s;tival, and her hu&s;band was more amiable than u&s;ual for &s;everal days afterwards. At her hou&s;e I became acquainted with two per&s;ons whom I will mention here: one was the Abb&eacute; Bexon, a little witty
<PB N="38" REF="034483_0602_0FFDEE6730D6B750">
hump-backed man, the great friend of Fran&ccedil;ois de Neufch&agrave;teau, and of Ma&s;&s;on de Marvilliers, and au|thor of a hi&s;tory of Loraine, that had but indifferent &s;ucce&s;s. The celebrated Buffon &s;ometimes employed his pen, as well as that of &s;everal others, to prepare materials and &s;ketches, which he afterwards beautified by the vivid tints &s;upplied by his brilliant imagination. Bexon, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the intere&s;t of his protector Buffon, and by that of &s;everal women of quality, who&s;e relations he had known at Remiremont, his native place, where there was a chapter of noble canone&s;&s;es, became pre|centor of the holy chapel at Paris. He brought thi|ther his mother and &s;i&s;ter, who would furni&s;h matter for an epi&s;ode, if I were inclined to introduce any not nece&s;&s;arily connected with my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE poor creature died too &s;oon for the happine&s;s of his tall &s;i&s;ter, with black eyes begging for adorers, and with beautiful &s;houlders, of which &s;he was fond of making a di&s;play. He came twice to &s;ee me at my father's, and was &s;o tran&s;ported at finding Xenophon in folio on my table, that in the height of his ec&s;tacy he would have ki&s;&s;ed me. But as in <HI>my</HI> opinion there was no good rea&s;on for it, I calmed him &s;o effectually by my re&s;erve, that his wit ever after was unattended by raptures, nor did I &s;ee him more, unle&s;s at my cou&s;in's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THE other per&s;on was the worthy Gibert; rigid in his morality, and infinitely gentle in his manners, he married at a very early age, a woman who&s;e beauty
<PB N="39" REF="034483_0603_0FFDEE4E95AA8628">
was greater than her good temper, and had a &s;on by her who&s;e education was his chief delight. He had an employ in the admini&s;tration of the po&s;t-office, and devoted his lei&s;ure moments to painting and mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>GIBERT had about him all the marks of a ju&s;t and &s;incere man: nor was his conduct ever at variance with them. His faults were tho&s;e of his judgment; his friend&s;hip was a &s;ort of fanatici&s;m; and we were tempted, while we lamented, to re&s;pect his errors. Gibert had been connected from his infancy with a man for whom he profe&s;&s;ed equal veneration and at|tachment, in who&s;e prai&s;e he was loud upon every oc|ca&s;ion, and of who&s;e friend&s;hip he was proud. Gi|bert was de&s;irous of being acquainted with me; his wife and he came to my father's; I returned their vi&s;it, and as they did not go out much together, he came alone from time to time to repeat his vi&s;it. I always received him with particular plea&s;ure, and in time we formed a connexion of a truly friendly na|ture. Gibert &s;oon began to &s;peak to me of his phoenix: it &s;eemed as if he could not be happy till his friend and I had an opportunity of admiring each other; and at la&s;t he invited him to meet me at dinner at his hou&s;e. I met a man who&s;e extreme &s;implicity bordered upon negligence. Speaking little, and never looking another in the face, it would have been diffi|cult for one, who had never heard him mentioned, to form an opinion of him from a &s;ingle interview; and I confe&s;s, notwith&s;tanding my particular ta&s;te for mode&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="034483_0604_0FFDEE5175FBDAD0">
demeanour, I &s;hould willingly have taken him at his word in regard to his own importance. However, as he neither wanted &s;en&s;e nor information, people gave him the greater credit, whenever he happened to bring them to view; and, like Gibert, &s;uppo&s;ed him to have more than he actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. His wife, who was rather in&s;ignificant, but by no means de&s;titute of &s;en&s;ibility, brought to mind the <HI>intentique ora tenebant</HI> of Virgil, whenever her hu&s;band opened his mouth to &s;peak. He cannot, however, be a man altogether of a vulgar mind, who thus finds means to impo&s;e, even upon tho&s;e who &s;ee him daily, in regard to his real merit: he mu&s;t be great in &s;omething; at lea&s;t in di&s;&s;imulation; and if circum&s;tances induce him to carry it as far as po&s;&s;ible in important affairs, in&s;tead of the fal&s;e philo&s;opher obtaining unde&s;erved e&s;teem, he may become a villain at the expence of his fellow-crea|tures. Hi&s;tory will enable us to judge of him by the &s;equel. I &s;eldom &s;aw this friend of Gibert. He aban|doned a lucrative place, and France it&s;elf, in order to &s;ettle in Switzerland, whither liberty called him, and whither he was led by his ta&s;te for a country life. Let him depart in peace: he will return too &s;oon.&mdash; That was the manner in which I became acquainted with PACHE; for <HI>Pache</HI> was the man. My readers will &s;ee how Gibert brought him to our hou&s;e, ten years after, and introduced him to my hu&s;band, who thought him probity it&s;elf; mentioned him at a mo|ment when his &s;uffrage was &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h a

<P>MADAM Trude was extremely de&s;irous of taking a journey, in order to vi&s;it a relation to whom &s;he was much attached, and propo&s;ed being ab&s;ent a fortnight or three weeks. Her hu&s;band objected to his <HI>counter</HI>'s remaining &s;o long without its feminine ornament; but thought the thing fea&s;ible, provided I would con&s;ent to come now and then in the middle of the day to take her place. My cou&s;in wi&s;hed I would have the kind|ne&s;s to do &s;o; her intimating &s;o much, was quite enough to induce me not to refu&s;e her; and my friend|&s;hip made me willingly undertake the ta&s;k. I went &s;even or eight times to take Madam Trude's place behind the counter. Her hu&s;band, highly delighted, and not a little proud, conducted him&s;elf with great propriety, attended to the external bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of the kindne&s;s of my behaviour. It was decreed, that at one time in my life, and in &s;pite of my aver&s;ion to trade, I &s;hould &s;ell watch-gla&s;&s;es and &s;pectacles. The &s;ituation was not agreeable.

<P>I WENT to Mademoi&s;elle De&s;portes' once or twice a week, on the days &s;he was in the habit of receiving company; and fine portraits I &s;hould have to paint if the originals were worth the pains; but were I to pour|tray coun&s;ellors of the <HI>Ch&acirc;telet,</HI> like little <HI>Mopinot,</HI> who&s;e preten&s;ions to wit were grounded on epigrams; the bigotted <HI>de la Pre&s;le,</HI> who had no other fault than that of being choleric, and a Jan&s;eni&s;t; a widow who hid a love of plea&s;ure under the ma&s;k of commodious devotion, like Madam <HI>de Blancfun&eacute;</HI>; and old an rich bachelor, too di&s;gu&s;ting to be named; a worthy man in|ce&s;&s;antly <HI>rea&s;oning,</HI> and as regular as clock-work, like Baudin, the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer; and a multitude of other individuals of different complexions, but of no greater value; it would only be throwing away my co|lours, and my time.

<P>MADEMOISELLE De&s;portes had inherited from her mother much delicacy and pride, joined to the art
<PB N="43" REF="034483_0607_0FFDEE62F4C794D8">
of employing her little fortune in commerce, without appearing to have any concern in it, and of dealing on a footing of confidence and equality with the rich and titled individuals who bought her goods. But as &s;uch a mode of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s is quite foreign to the &s;pirit of trade, which &s;upports it&s;elf by active &s;pe|culations, &s;he found her little inheritance growing &s;maller every day, and at la&s;t bade adieu to commerce, reducing her expences at the &s;ame time on a more mo|derate &s;cale.</P>
<P>HER di&s;po&s;ition, her manners, the &s;ober way in which &s;he lived, and the fondne&s;s &s;he te&s;tified for me, had made my mother wi&s;h to &s;ee me cultivate her ac|quaintance.

Mademoi&s;elle De&s;portes, probably with a view of exerci&s;ing my complai&s;ance, often &s;et me down to play, which was my aver&s;ion; but the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a partner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Four-handed piquet is played very commonly in France.&mdash; <HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>, and permi&s;&s;ion to laugh at my own ab&s;ence of mind, rendered the trial of my pa|tience le&s;s &s;evere.</P>
<P>HERE, in his turn, I cannot help bringing forward on the &s;tage an old man lately arrived from Pondi|cherry, and with whom I kept up a frequent and agree|able intercour&s;e for little le&s;s than a year. My father, &s;ome how or other (in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s I believe)
<PB N="44" REF="034483_0608_0FFDEE56EC0DC948">
had become acquainted with a reduced officer, meta|morpho&s;ed into a clerk without a place, and had af|terwards received him on the footing of a friend. His name was Demontchery. He was about &s;ix and thirty, of poli&s;hed manners, and in&s;inuating conver&s;ation, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e graces which are de|rived from a knowledge of the world, and per|haps from tender connexions with the fair.&mdash; Demontchery was attentive to my father; but &s;el|dom came to my mother's apartment, who would not have &s;uffered any man to pay his court to her. As to me, he frankly profe&s;&s;ed re&s;pect, e&s;teem, and &s;o forth, as well as an inclination to offer me his heart if fortune &s;hould prove more kind&mdash;She &s;ent him on a voyage to the Ea&s;t-Indies. He wrote to us, and did not conceal his wi&s;hes for &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s as might enable him to return with well-founded preten&s;ions; but being no more than a captain of &s;epoys, and too honourable a man to under&s;tand any thing about ma|king money, he had not, I believe, got very forward in the world, when he returned after &s;even years ab|&s;ence, and learned that my hand had been di&s;po&s;ed of a fortnight before. I know not what is become of him, nor the &s;entiments he might have in&s;pired me with, if my inclinations had been free. During his &s;tay at Pondicherry, he made acquaintance with M. de Sainte-Lette, one of the members of the council, and intru&s;ted him with letters for my father, when
<PB N="45" REF="034483_0609_0FFDEE5F2081DE70">
the council di&s;patched Sainte-Lette to Paris, in 1776, to conduct &s;ome important affair.</P>
<P>SAINTE-LETTE was more than &s;ixty years of age. He was a man whom a gay turn of mind, and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, had led a&s;tray in his youth, when he &s;quandered his fortune at Paris. He had gone over to America, and had remained thirteen years at Loui&s;iana, as director of the Indian trade. Hav|ing afterwards removed to A&s;ia, he was employed in the admini&s;tration of public affairs at Pondicherry, and was endeavouring to ama&s;s the means of living or of dying in France, on &s;ome future day, with M. de Sevelinge, the friend of his youth, of whom I &s;hall hereafter make &s;ome mention. A grave and &s;o|lemn voice, di&s;tingui&s;hed by that accent which is de|rived from experience and adver&s;ity, and &s;upported by the ready expre&s;&s;ion of a cultivated mind, &s;truck me in Sainte-Lette, the fir&s;t moment I heard him &s;peak. Demontchery had &s;poken to him of me; and probably made him de&s;ire our acquaintance. My fa|ther was civil and I paid him much attention, be|cau&s;e he &s;oon prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in his favour. I found his company very agreeable; he was fond of mine, and during his &s;tay never &s;uffered a week to pa&s;s without paying me a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>PERSONS who have &s;een a great deal, are always worth hearing, and tho&s;e who have felt a great deal, have always &s;een more than any other per&s;ons, even when they have travelled le&s;s than Sainte-Lette. He
<PB N="46" REF="034483_0610_0FFDEE5C4F4393D8">
had more of that kind of information which is derived from experience, than of that which is collected from books: with le&s;s preten&s;ions to the title of a learned man, than to that of a philo&s;opher, he rea&s;oned from his knowledge of the human heart; and &s;till retained a ta&s;te for the lighter kinds of poetry, in which he was no mean proficient. He gave me &s;ome of his productions; and I communicated to him in return &s;ome of my <HI>reveries.</HI>&mdash;'Mademoi&s;elle,' &s;aid he repeat|edly, in the tone of phophecy, or in that of convic|tion, 'you may do what you will to avoid it; but you will certainly write a book.'&mdash;'It &s;hall be under another name then,' an&s;wered I, 'for I would &s;ooner cut off my fingers than turn author.'</P>
<P>AT my father's Sainte-Lette met a per&s;on with whom I was become acquainted a few months before, and who was fated to have a powerful influence over my future fortune, though I little thought &s;o at the time: I have already &s;aid that Sophy, more taken up than I with paying and receiving vi&s;its, was far from finding it conducive to her advantage. She had &s;poken to me &s;everal times of a man of great merit, who had a place at Amiens, and was frequently at her mother's, while re&s;ident there; which, however, was not gene|rally the ca&s;e, becau&s;e he vi&s;ited Paris every winter, and in the &s;ummer often made long journies. She had only mentioned him, becau&s;e in the in&s;ignificant crowd with which &s;he was &s;urrounded, &s;he was plea&s;ed to meet with an individual who&s;e in&s;tructive conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="47" REF="034483_0611_1000F6B28C732DF8">
always &s;eemed to contain &s;omething new, who&s;e au&s;tere, but &s;imple manners, in&s;pired confidence, and who was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, though not univer&s;ally beloved, becau&s;e his &s;everity, which bordered on the &s;arca&s;tic, gave many people offence. Sophy had &s;poken to him al&s;o of her beloved friend. Nothing indeed was talked of in her family but the intimacy and con&s;tancy of a convent connexion, which ac|quired a certain degree of re&s;pectability from time. He had al&s;o &s;een my portrait, which Madam Can|net had hung up in a con&s;picuous &s;ituation. 'Why then,' he u&s;ed to &s;ay, 'do you not make me acquaint|ed with this amiable friend?' I go every year to Paris &mdash;Shall I never have a letter to deliver to her?' He obtained the commi&s;&s;ion he de&s;ired in the month of December 1775: I was then in mourning for my mother, and in that &s;tate of tender melancholy, which follows violent grief. Whoever came on the part of Sophy, was &s;ure of a good reception. 'You will receive this,' &s;aid my beloved friend in her letter, 'from the hands of M. Roland de la Platiere, the philo&s;opher you have &s;ometimes heard me mention&mdash; an enlightened man, of &s;potle&s;s reputation, who can be reproached with nothing but his too great admira|tion for the ancients, at the expence of the moderns, whom he undervalues, and with being too fond of &s;peaking of him&s;elf.' This portrait can hardly be called a &s;ketch; but the outline is well drawn. I found him a man con&s;iderably turned of forty, tall,
<PB N="48" REF="034483_0612_0FFDEE832193CF58">
and negligent in his carriage, with that &s;tiffne&s;s which is often contracted by &s;tudy; but his manners were ea&s;y and &s;imple, and without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the fa&s;h|ionable graces, he combined the politene&s;s of a well-bred man, with the gravity of a philo&s;opher. Want of fle&s;h, a complexion accidentally yellow, and a fore|head very high, and very thinly covered with hair, did not de&s;troy the effect of a regular &s;et of features, though it rendered them rather re&s;pectable than engaging. There was be&s;ides great meaning in his &s;mile; and a mo&s;t lively expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed to light up his countenance, and give him, as it were, a new face, whenever he grew animated in narration, or when any agreeable idea came acro&s;s his mind. His voice was ma&s;culine, and his &s;entences were &s;hort (like tho&s;e of a man afflicted with a difficulty of breathing): his conver&s;ation, which was full of inter|e&s;ting matter, becau&s;e his head was full of ideas, occupi|ed the mind more than it plea&s;ed the ear; his language, though &s;ometimes impre&s;&s;ive, being always monoto|nous and har&s;h. An agreeable voice is, in my opin|ion, a very uncommon and very powerful accom|pli&s;hment: it does not depend upon the quality of the &s;ound alone; but re&s;ults al&s;o from that delicacy of &s;entiment which furni&s;hes a variety of expre&s;&s;ion, and of tone.</P>

<P>THIS effect of the organ of &s;peech, a thing very different from a &s;trong voice, is not more common among profe&s;&s;ional orators, than among the multi|tudes that compo&s;e our &s;ocial circles. I looked for it in the three national a&s;&s;emblies, and could meet with no|body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it in perfection. Mirabeau him|&s;elf, with the commanding magic of a noble delivery, neither &s;poke in a plea&s;ing key, nor pronounced in the mo&s;t agreeable manner. The Clermonts came nearer to the mark. Where, then, I may be a&s;ked, is your model? I might an&s;wer like the painter, when a&s;ked whence he took the charming air, that he gave to the heads created by his pencil? Hence, &s;aid he, putting his finger to his forehead, I &s;hould put mine to my ears. I was never a great frequenter of the theatre; but I thought I could perceive that the kind of merit in que&s;tion was equally uncommon there. <HI>Larive,</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="034483_0614_0FFDEE88C5CE7728">
the only one perhaps who de&s;erves to mentioned, did not come entirely up to my idea.</P>
<P>WHEN upon entering the period of adole&s;cence, I experienced that agitation which the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing produces in the bo&s;om of young women, I was moved at the &s;ound of my own voice, and was obliged to modulate it in order to plea&s;e my|&s;elf. I can ea&s;ily conceive that the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;i|bility of the Greeks made them &s;et a high value upon every part of the art of &s;peech; and I can al&s;o conceive it natural for <HI>&s;an&s;culoti&s;me</HI> to make us di&s;dain tho&s;e graces, and to lead us to a barbarous rudene&s;s, equally di&s;tant from the preci&s;ion of the Spartans in their energetic language, and from the eloquence of the amiable Athenians.</P>
<P>BUT it is long &s;ince we parted with La Blancherie, either at Orleans, or el&s;ewhere, and high time to give him his di&s;mi&s;&s;al.</P>
<P>RETURNING &s;hortly after my mother's death, he knew nothing of that event till he came to &s;ee us and di&s;covered a degree of &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;orrow, that plea&s;ed and affected me; nor did I look upon him, in the repeated vi&s;its he afterwards paid me, with an eye of indifference. My father, who at fir&s;t made it a rule to &s;tay with me, when any one came, began to think the bu&s;ine&s;s of duenna was by no means amu&s;|ing, and that it would be more convenient to leave me to my&s;elf, and the maid, and to &s;hut his door again&s;t every body, who&s;e age and gravity &s;hould not be &s;uch
<PB N="51" REF="034483_0615_0FFDEE8A5E22DBE8">
as to render his attendance unnece&s;&s;ary. He told me accordingly, that he intended to beg La Blancherie to di&s;continue his vi&s;its. I did not &s;ay a word in an&s;wer, although I felt &s;ome degree of pain. I re|flected on that which I &s;uppo&s;ed my &s;uitor would &s;uf|fer from the prohibition, and determined to convey the intimation to him my&s;elf; for my father's manner made me fear he would give it in an unhand&s;ome way. To tell the truth, La Blancherie had prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in his favour; and I thought it not impo&s;&s;ible that I might love him: my head alone was working, I be|lieve; but I was not in a fair way to get on. I wrote then a hand&s;ome letter, which gave La Blancherie his di&s;charge, and which deprived him of all hope of my receiving his an&s;wer, but which was not calculated to de&s;troy any other he might entertain.</P>
<P>THE ice thus broken gave a free cour&s;e to tender and melancholy ideas, by which my happine&s;s was not materially di&s;turbed. Sophy came to Paris, and made &s;ome &s;tay there with her mother and her &s;i&s;ter Henrietta, who finding her&s;elf on a level with us, by the addition to our age, and the &s;edate|ne&s;s &s;he had acquired, became al&s;o my friend. Her lively imagination &s;truck fire out of every thing, and animated every connexion in which &s;he had a &s;hare.</P>
<P>I WENT often to the garden of the Luxemburg with my two friends and Mademoi&s;elle d'Hangard, and there I &s;ometimes met La Blancherie. He u&s;ed to
<PB N="52" REF="034483_0616_0FFDEE8F5BC29140">
bow to me re&s;pectfully; and I returned his &s;alute not without emotion.&mdash;'You are acquainted then with that gentleman?' &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle d'Hangard one day, having at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed his bow was meant for her.&mdash;'Yes.'&mdash;'Do you chance to know him too?'&mdash;'Certainly I do, though I never &s;poke to him in my life; but I am in the habit of vi&s;iting the Mi&s;s Bordenaves, to the younge&s;t of whom he paid his addre&s;&s;es.'&mdash;'Is it long &s;ince?'&mdash;'A year, or perhaps eighteen months. He found means to introduce him&s;elf: called there from time to time, and at la&s;t made a declaration in form: the young ladies are rich, and the younge&s;t a pretty girl. He has not a &s;hilling him&s;elf, and is a candidate for an heire&s;s; for he made the &s;ame propo&s;al to one of their acquaintance, as they afterwards heard; he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and we have ever &s;ince been accu&s;tom|ed to call him the lover of the eleven thou&s;and vir|gins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In allu&s;ion to a legendary tale, which &s;tates the <HI>miraculous</HI> martyrdom of eleven thou&s;and virgins.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>.'&mdash;'But, pray, how came you acquainted with him?'&mdash;'By &s;eeing him frequently at Madame l'Epine's concert,' &s;aid I, biting my lips, and keeping the re&s;t to my&s;elf, not a little vexed at having thought my|&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the heart of a man, who, without doubt, had &s;olicited my hand merely becau&s;e I was an only daughter; and &s;till more &s;o at having written him a letter, which he did not de&s;erve&mdash;Matter for

meditation as to the exerci&s;e of my prudence on fu|ture occa&s;ions!</P>
<P>A FEW months had elap&s;ed, when a little <HI>Sa|voyard</HI> came and told the maid &s;omebody wi&s;hed to &s;peak with her, I forget where: &s;he went out, re|turned, and informed me that M. La Blancherie had de&s;ired her to beg me to receive his vi&s;it. It was Sunday, and I was waiting for &s;ome of my relations. 'Yes,' an&s;wered I, 'he may come, but let it be in|&s;tantly; and &s;ince he is waiting for you at a little di&s;tance from the door, go and bring him in.' La Blancherie came, and found me &s;itting by my fire|&s;ide.&mdash;'I have not dared, Mademoi&s;elle, to wait up|on you, &s;ince the prohibition you &s;ent me, though exceedingly de&s;irous of &s;eeing you; nor can I expre&s;s all I &s;uffered from the dear and cruel letter I then re|ceived. My &s;ituation has undergone a con&s;iderable change &s;ince that time; and I have now &s;ome pro|jects, to which you are probably not altogether a &s;tranger.' He immediately laid before me the plan of a work of morality and critici&s;m, in the form of letters, and in the manner of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> and pro|po&s;ed to me to hear &s;ome of them. I let him go on without interrupting him, and even waited, after he had made a &s;hort pau&s;e, in order that he might get to the end of his ro&s;ary. When he had &s;aid all he had to &s;ay, I took my turn to &s;peak, and ob&s;erved to him politely, that I had taken upon my&s;elf the care of reque&s;ting him to di&s;continue his vi&s;its, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="034483_0618_0FFDEE93CDC67D40">
the &s;entiments which he had declared to my fa|ther, made me &s;uppo&s;e he attached &s;ome importance to their continuance, and I had wi&s;hed to &s;how him my gratitude by that mark of attention; that at my age, the imagination was bu&s;y on all occa&s;ions, and &s;ometimes dre&s;&s;ed up objects in very fal&s;e colours; but that error was not a crime, and that I was &s;uffi|ciently recovered from mine to render all concern on his part needle&s;s; that I admired his literary projects, without wi&s;hing to bear a part in them, any more than in tho&s;e of others; that I confined my&s;elf to good wi&s;hes for the &s;ucce&s;s of all the au|thors in the world; as well as for his, in all po&s;&s;i|ble ways; and that it was to tell him &s;o I had con&s;ented to receive him, in order that he might &s;ave him&s;elf in future all trouble of the kind; in con&s;equence of which I begged him to put an end to his vi&s;it. Surpri&s;e, grief, agitation, every thing, in &s;hort, that is becoming in like ca&s;es, was about to be di&s;played. I &s;topped him by &s;aying, I did not know whether the Mi&s;s Bordenaves, and the other ladies to whom he had paid his addre&s;&s;es, about the &s;ame time, had expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with equal frankne&s;s; but that mine was without bounds; and that the re&s;olution it indicated did not admit of explanation.

<P>THIS hero having made his <HI>exit,</HI> let us return to Sainte-Lette and Roland.</P>
<P>WE had reached the end of the &s;ummer 1776; and during the eight or nine preceding months I had &s;een M. Roland &s;everal times. His vi&s;its were not frequent; but he made long ones, like a per&s;on, who, not going to a particular place in order to &s;hew him&s;elf, but becau&s;e he has a &s;atisfaction in being there, &s;tays as long as he decently can. His frank and in&s;truc|tive conver&s;ation never tired me, and he was fond of &s;eeing me li&s;ten to him with attention; a thing which I am very capable of, even with tho&s;e who are not &s;o well informed as Roland, and which has perhaps pro|cured me &s;till more friends than the talent of &s;peaking with &s;ome facility. I had become acquainted with him on his return from Germany; he was then prepar|ing to make the tour of Italy, and &s;ettling his affairs, a thing to which prudent people &s;eldom fail to at|tend, when on the eve of a long ab&s;ence; he had cho&s;en me for the depo&s;itary of his manu&s;cripts, which were to remain in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in ca&s;e he &s;hould meet with any mi&s;chance. I was much affected by this particular mark of e&s;teem, and received it with many thanks. The day of his departure he

dined at my father's with Sainte-Lette; and on tak|ing leave, begged permi&s;&s;ion to &s;alute me. I know not how it is, but that favour is never granted by a young woman without a blu&s;h, let her imagination be ever &s;o tranquil.&mdash;'You are fortunate to be &s;etting off,' &s;aid Sainte-Lette, in his grave and &s;olemn voice; but make ha&s;te to return, and a&s;k for as much more!'</P>
<P>DURING Sainte-Lette's &s;tay in France, his friend de Sevelinge becoming a widower, he repaired to his re&s;idence at Soi&s;&s;ons, to &s;hare his grief, and brought him to Paris, in order to divert his attention from his lo&s;s. They came to &s;ee me together. Seve|linge, who&s;e age was about fifty-two, was a gen|tleman of &s;mall fortune: he held a financial &s;itu|ation in the country, and devoted part of his time to &s;tudy, like a philo&s;opher who is &s;en&s;ible of its charms. Having thus become acquainted, we kept up our in|tercour&s;e after Sainte-Lette's departure, who u&s;ed to &s;ay, that, on leaving France, he &s;hould feel a degree of plea&s;ure at the thought of his friend's not lo&s;ing the advantage of my acquaintance.&mdash;He even begged permi&s;&s;ion to put into his hands for a &s;hort time &s;ome manu&s;cripts, which, as I have al|ready &s;aid, I had &s;ubmitted to his in&s;pection. This intere&s;ting old man embarked for the fifth or &s;ixth time in his life. An ulcer in his head, of which &s;ome &s;ymptoms had already appeared, broke while he was at &s;ea; he arrived &s;ick at Pondicherry; and died there &s;ix weeks after he di&s;embarked. We heard of his death by means of Demontchery. He
<PB N="57" REF="034483_0621_0FFDEE9BDE23F528">
was greatly regretted by Sevelinge, who continued now and then to write to me; and his letters, of which the &s;tyle and the matter were equally agreeable, gave me great plea&s;ure. They bore the impre&s;&s;ion of that mild philo&s;ophy, and melancholy &s;en&s;ibility, to which I have always felt my&s;elf &s;o much inclined. I have remarked what Diderot &s;ays on this &s;ubject, with &s;o much truth; 'that good ta&s;te implies good &s;en&s;e, de|licate organs, and &s;omewhat of a melancholy turn.'</P>
<P>MY father, who&s;e kindne&s;s was gradually dimin|i&s;hing, being of opinion it was very unnece&s;&s;ary to keep up an idle corre&s;pondence that put him to the ex|pence of po&s;tage, I communicated my di&s;tre&s;s to my little uncle, and was authorized to have the letters of Sevelinge, whom he had &s;een at our hou&s;e, addre&s;&s;ed under cover to him. My manu&s;cripts came back to me with &s;ome critical ob&s;ervations, of which I was very proud; for I did not imagine that my <HI>works</HI> were worth the trouble of reviewing. They were in my own opinion &s;en&s;ible enough; but at the &s;ame time mere common-place that any body might have written; nor did I conceive they had any merit, except the &s;in|gularity of their being the productions of a little girl. I long retained that mode&s;t &s;implicity in regard to my&s;elf. Nothing le&s;s was nece&s;&s;ary than the bu&s;|tle of the revolution, the various changes of my &s;ituation, and a frequent opportunity of making compari&s;ons in a great crowd, and among per&s;ons e&s;teemed for their merit, to enable me to perceive
<PB N="58" REF="034483_0622_0FFDEE9E8F40D4B8">
that the bench on which I was &s;tanding, was not likely to break down with the throng. I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, however, and I ha&s;ten to do &s;o, that all tended rather to prove to me the degradation of the &s;pecies in my native country, than to give me a high opinion of my&s;elf. It is not wit that is wanting; you meet it at every turn: it is &s;oundne&s;s of judgment, and a &s;trong temper of mind. Where the&s;e two qua|lities are wanting, I cannot recognize any thing de|&s;erving to be called a man.&mdash;In truth, Diogenes was in the right to take a lantern. But a revolu|tion will &s;erve as well: I do not know indeed a bet|ter touch&s;tone, nor a &s;tandard more exact.</P>
<P>THE academy of Be&s;an&ccedil;on had propo&s;ed the fol|lowing que&s;tion as a &s;ubject for a prize: <HI>How can the education of women be made conducive to the improve|ment of men?</HI> My imagination was directly on the wing: I took up my pen, and wrote a <HI>di&s;&s;ertation</HI> which I &s;ent anonymou&s;ly, and which, as may ea&s;ily be imagined, was not deemed worthy of the prize. There was none indeed &s;o honoured. The &s;ub|ject was propo&s;ed again for the following year, with what re&s;ult I know not; but I recollect that, in attempting to di&s;cu&s;s this matter, I felt the ab&s;ur|dity of fixing a mode of education, without attend|ing to the general manners, which depend upon the government; and thought it injudicious to at|tempt reforming one &s;ex by means of the other, in|&s;tead of ameliorating the whole &s;pecies by good laws.
<PB N="59" REF="034483_0623_0FFDEEA142576938">
Accordingly I found no difficulty in &s;aying what I thought women ought to be; but I added, they could only be rendered &s;uch by a new order of things. That idea certainly did not corre&s;pond with the intention of the academy: I rea&s;oned about the problem without &s;olving it.</P>
<P>I CONVEYED the di&s;&s;ertation to M. de Sevelinge; but after having forwarded it to Be&s;an&ccedil;on, he &s;ent me nothing but a few remarks on the &s;tyle. The warmth of compo&s;ition was over; I found the plan of my production exceedingly defective; and amu&s;ed my&s;elf in writing a critique upon it, as if it had been the work of a per&s;on whom I &s;hould have been glad to ridicule. This may be compared to a man's tickling his &s;ides, in order to make him&s;elf laugh, or &s;lapping his cheeks by way of warming them; but mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly no one could laugh with|out company more heartily, or more innocently, than I did. Sevelinge, in return, communicated to me an academical di&s;cour&s;e of his own writing, on the <HI>faculty of &s;peech,</HI> which he had addre&s;&s;ed to the French academy, and concerning which d'Alem|bert had written to him in hand&s;ome terms. If I recollect aright, there was in that work a great deal of metaphy&s;ics, and &s;ome little affectation. Six months, a year, and more, pa&s;&s;ed away in this men|tal intercour&s;e, in the mid&s;t of which a variety of ideas occurred. Sevelinge appeared to be unea&s;y at my &s;ituation, and tired of living alone. He
<PB N="60" REF="034483_0624_0FFDEEA2CDB49350">
made many reflections on the plea&s;ures of a <HI>think|ing</HI> &s;ociety. I thought it to be de&s;ired, and we rea&s;oned at great length on the &s;ubject. I know not what fancy afterwards got into his head, but he made a journey to Paris, and came to my father's in di&s;gui&s;e, as if upon bu&s;ine&s;s. The mo&s;t whim|&s;ical part of the &s;tory is, that I did not know him, though I let him in. But the great air of mortification with which he left me, awakened in my mind the idea of his features; I thought after he was gone that the &s;tranger was very like Seve|linge; and &s;oon found by his letters it was Seve|linge him&s;elf. This curious circum&s;tance made an im|pre&s;&s;ion on me by no means agreeable, and which I cannot de&s;cribe; our corre&s;pondence &s;lackened, and at la&s;t cea&s;ed entirely, as I &s;hall hereafter relate.</P>
<P>I WENT now and then to Vincennes: my uncle's canonical retreat was pretty, the walk delightful, and his company agreeable; but though he had the plea|&s;ure of having his hou&s;e very well managed by Ma|demoi&s;elle d'Hannaches, he began to perceive he mu&s;t pay for it by &s;uffering all the tea&s;ing, ill-humour, and folly of a conceited old maid. The ca&s;tle of Vin|cennes was inhabited by a great number of per&s;ons to whom the court allowed apartments: <HI>here</HI> was Mo|reau de la Garve, an old cen&s;or royal; <HI>there</HI> a female wit, no other than Madam de Pui&s;ieux; a little higher a counte&s;s de Laurencier; a little lower an officer's widow, and &s;o on to the end of the chapter;

to &s;ay nothing of the king's lieutenant, Rougemont, whom Mirabeau made known to the world, and who&s;e carbuncled face, and in&s;olent &s;tupidity, rendered him a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting character. A company of invalids, of which the officers' wives made part of the &s;ociety, amounted, in conjunction with the above motley crew, and the dean and chapter, to no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred inhabitants within the walls of the ca&s;tle, without reckoning the pri&s;oners in the tower. My uncle, though well received every where, was &s;eldom a&s;&s;idious in his vi&s;its, and &s;aw little company at home. But on our return from our walks, we generally &s;top|ped in the evening at the pavilion of the bridge that overlooks the park, where the females a&s;&s;embled. Here I &s;hould al&s;o have portraits to paint if I had lei|&s;ure; but time is treading clo&s;e upon my heels, and the road I have yet to travel is long. I am there|fore obliged to pa&s;s over a great number of things. Very pretty things might however be &s;aid concerning the dancer's in the robbers'-walk, d'Artois's hor&s;e-races, the follies of Seguin, the Duke of Orleans's ca&s;hier, who&s;e birth-day (Seguin's) was celebrated by illuminations, and who became a bankrupt &s;hortly after&mdash;and then the plea&s;ant walks in the wood, and the beautiful pro&s;pect from the upper park, by the &s;ide of the Marne, for the &s;ake of which we u&s;ed to climb over a breach in the wall; and the hermits in the wood, who were &s;ituated in &s;o picture&s;que a &s;pot, and in who&s;e church was a picture admirably executed,

and curiou&s;ly de&s;igned, in which thou&s;ands of devils were &s;een tormenting the damned in as many different ways; and my readings with my uncle, e&s;pecially that of Voltaire's tragedies, of which we were one day rehear&s;ing &s;everal of the parts, by turns, when, at the moment of the greate&s;t pathos, Ma|demoi&s;elle d'Hannaches, who had been &s;pinning in &s;ilence, &s;et up a loud outcry again&s;t the poultry, to which we &s;hould have been glad to have &s;ent her; and our lame concerts after &s;upper, when, upon the table that had ju&s;t been cleared, muff-ca&s;es &s;erved as a mu&s;ic-de&s;k for the worthy canon Bareux, with his &s;pectacles on his no&s;e, and &s;trumming his ba&s;s-viol, while I &s;craped on the fiddle, and my uncle played out of tune on the flute&mdash;Ah! I will come back again to tho&s;e plea&s;ing &s;cenes, if &s;uffered to exi&s;t; but it is now time to return home, after having &s;poken however of a certain great romancer, who had ob|tained &s;ome degree of fame.</P>

<P>THE manu&s;cripts left with me by M. Roland made me better acquainted with him, during the eighteen months he pa&s;&s;ed in Italy, than frequent vi&s;its could have done. They con&s;i&s;ted of travels, reflections, plans of literary works, and anecdotes in which he was per&s;onally concerned: a &s;trong mind, rigorous probity, &s;trict principles, learning, and ta&s;te, were evident in every page.</P>
<P>BORN in opulence, and de&s;cended from an ancient family, of the highe&s;t character for integrity in the law, he had &s;een, while a young man, all his hopes
<PB N="64" REF="034483_0628_0FFDEEAEE3CD6BA8">
of fortune vani&s;h, owing to a want of manage|ment on the one hand, and to prodigal expence on the other. The younge&s;t of five brothers, four of whom were compelled to embrace the clerical profe&s;&s;ion, he had left his paternal roof friendle&s;s, and alone, at the age of nineteen, that he might not take holy orders, nor enter into trade, from both of which he was equally aver&s;e. His fir&s;t flight carried him to Nantz; where he &s;tayed &s;ome time in a mer|chant's compting-hou&s;e, in order to gain informa|tion concerning a variety of matters, with a view of going to India. His preparations were all made; when he was taken with a &s;pitting of blood, and was forbidden to go to &s;ea, by the phy&s;icians, under penalty of death. He next repaired to Rouen, where his relation, M. Godinot, in&s;pector of manufactures, propo&s;ed to him to enter into that department. He determined to do &s;o; &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his activity and readine&s;s; and at la&s;t obtained a lu|crative employ. Travelling and &s;tudy divided his time, and filled up every moment of his life.</P>
<P>BEFORE he &s;et off for Italy, he had introduced to my father his be&s;t-beloved brother, a Benedictine monk, at that time prior of the college of Clugny at Paris; a man of &s;en&s;e, of agreeable manners, and of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition. He came now and then to &s;ee me, and communicated to me the notes which his brother tran&s;mitted to him; for wherever M. Roland went, he committed his ob&s;ervations to
<PB N="65" REF="034483_0629_0FFDEEB1A1599CE8">
paper. They were the notes which at his return he publi&s;hed in the form of letters, entru&s;ting the care of printing them to &s;ome friends at Dieppe, one of whom having a rage for the Italian, overloaded them with pa&s;&s;ages in that language, by adding tho&s;e of his own fabrication. This work, abounding in mat|ter, wants only to be better dige&s;ted in order to hold the highe&s;t rank among books of the kind. Ever &s;ince our marriage, we have had the intention of putting it into another &s;hape; but I wanted to &s;ee Italy al&s;o; and time and events led us another way.</P>
<P>ON M. Roland's return, I found my&s;elf in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a friend: his gravity, his manners, and his &s;tudious habits, all concurred in making me con|&s;ider him as a per&s;on of no &s;ex, or rather as a philo&s;o|pher, who had only a mental exi&s;tence. A kind of confidence grew up between us, the plea&s;ure he took in my company making him feel a de&s;ire of coming more frequently. It was near five years &s;ince my ac|quaintance with him began, when he fir&s;t made a de|claration of his tender &s;entiments. I did not hear it with indifference, becau&s;e I e&s;teemed him more than any man I had yet &s;een; but I had remarked that neither he nor his family were altogether indifferent to worldly con&s;iderations. I told him frankly, that I felt my&s;elf honoured by his addre&s;&s;es, and that I &s;hould be happy to make him a return for his affec|tion; but that I did not think he would find me a proper match. I then expo&s;ed to him without re|&s;erve
<PB N="66" REF="034483_0630_0FFDEEB470E96490">
the &s;tate of my father's affairs&mdash;he was a ruined man. By prevailing upon my&s;elf to a&s;k him for an account of my fortune, at the ri&s;k of incurring his di&s;plea&s;ure, I had &s;aved five hundred livres a year, making, with my little moveables, all that remain|ed of the apparent opulence in which I had been brought up.</P>
<P>MY father was &s;till in the vigour of life; his er|rors might lead him to contract debts, which his inability to pay might render di&s;graceful; he might marry imprudently, and add to tho&s;e evils little beg|gars who would bear my name, &amp;c. &amp;c. I was too proud to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the malevolence of a family, which might feel its con&s;equence hurt by the con|nexion, or to the genero&s;ity of a hu&s;band who would find in it a &s;ource of chagrin. I advi&s;ed M. Ro|land, as a third per&s;on might have done, to give up all thoughts of me: he per&s;i&s;ted; I was moved; and con|&s;ented to his taking the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps with my father. But as he preferred making his application in writing, it was agreed that he &s;hould not &s;end his letter till his return to his u&s;ual place of re&s;idence. During the re&s;t of his &s;tay at Paris, I &s;aw him every day; con&s;idered him as the being with whom my future fate was to be connected; and conceived a real affection for his per&s;on. As &s;oon as he returned to Amiens, he wrote to my father, making known his wi&s;hes and de|&s;igns. My father thought the letter dry: he did not like M. Roland's &s;everity, and felt no inclination to
<PB N="67" REF="034483_0631_0FFDEEB724345750">
have for his &s;on-in-law a man of rigid principles, who&s;e very looks would wear the appearance of reproach. He an&s;wered in rude and impertinent terms, and &s;hew|ed me the whole, when his letter was &s;ent off. I came to a re&s;olution immediately. I wrote to M. Roland, and told him the event had ju&s;tified my fears in re&s;pect to my father; that I did not wi&s;h to be the cau&s;e of his receiving farther affronts; and that I begged him to abandon his de&s;ign. I made known to my father what his conduct had induced me to do; and added, he could not be &s;urpri&s;ed if I &s;hould in con&s;equence &s;eek a new &s;ituation, and retire to a convent. But as I knew he had &s;everal debts of an urgent nature, I left him the &s;hare of plate that belonged to me, to &s;atisfy his creditors; hired a little apartment in the convent of the Congregation; and there took up my abode, with a firm re&s;olution to regulate my expences by my income. I did &s;o; and curious particulars I &s;hould have to relate of a &s;ituation in which I began to avail my&s;elf of the re&s;ources of a &s;trong mind. I calculat|ed my expences to a farthing, re&s;erving a trifle for pre&s;ents to the per&s;ons who did the menial offices about the hou&s;e. Potatoes, rice, and dry kidney beans, dre&s;&s;ed in a pot with a &s;prinkling of &s;alt, and a &s;mall bit of butter, varied my food, and were cooked with little lo&s;s of time. I went out twice a week; once to vi&s;it my aged relations; and once to my father's, in order to look over his linen, and take away with me whatever &s;tood in need of mending. The re&s;t of
<PB N="68" REF="034483_0632_0FFDEEBAF8923168">
my time, &s;hut up under my roof of &s;now, as I u&s;ed to call it (for I was lodged near the &s;ky, and it was in the winter), and refu&s;ing to mix habitually with the boarders, I applied to my &s;tudies; &s;teeled my heart again&s;t adver&s;ity; and, by de&s;erving happine&s;s, aven|ged my&s;elf on fate which denied it me. Every even|ing the kind-hearted Agatha came to pa&s;s an hour with me, and accompanied the effu&s;ions of her &s;oul with the con&s;olatory tears of friend&s;hip. A few turns in the garden when every body was out of the way, con&s;tituted my &s;olitary walks. The re&s;ignation of a patient temper, the quiet of a good con&s;cience, the elevation of &s;pirit which &s;ets misfortune at defiance, the laborious habits that make the hours pa&s;s &s;o rapidly away, the delicate ta&s;te of a &s;ound mind finding in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence and of its own value, plea|&s;ures which the vulgar never know; the&s;e were my riches. I was not always free from melancholy; but even melancholy had its charms. Though I was not happy, I had within me all the means of being &s;o; and had rea&s;on to be proud of knowing how to do with|out what I wanted in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>M. ROLAND, a&s;toni&s;hed and afflicted, continued to write to me, like a man con&s;tant in his affection, but offended at my father's conduct. He came at the expiration of five or &s;ix months, and felt the flame of love revive on &s;eeing me at the grate, where I pre&s;erved an appearance of pro&s;perity. He was de|&s;irous of taking me out of my confinement, offered
<PB N="69" REF="034483_0633_0FFDEEBC892F3A10">
me his hand again, and pre&s;&s;ed me to receive the nup|tial benediction from his brother the prior. I entered into a deep deliberation concerning what I ought to do. I could not help being &s;en&s;ible, that a man under forty-five would not have waited &s;everal months with|out endeavouring to make me change my re&s;olution; and I readily confe&s;s that my &s;entiments were reduced by that con&s;ideration to a &s;tate which admitted of no|thing like illu&s;ion. I con&s;idered on the other hand, that his per&s;everance, the fruit al&s;o of mature delibe|ration, proved his &s;en&s;e of my merit; and &s;ince he had overcome his repugnance to the di&s;agreeable cir|cum&s;tances that might attend the match, I was the more &s;ecure of retaining his e&s;teem, which I &s;hould not find it difficult to ju&s;tify. Be&s;ides, if matrimony was, as I thought, a rigorous tie, a partner&s;hip, in which the woman generally undertakes to provide for the happine&s;s of both parties, was it not better to ex|ert my faculties, and my courage, in that honourable &s;tation, than in the forlorn and a&s;etic life I was leading in a convent? Here I might &s;tate at length the many prudent reflections, as I conceive them to be, that guided me; and yet I did not make all tho&s;e that the circum&s;tances might have warranted, but which ex|perience alone can &s;ugge&s;t. I became then the wife of a truly hone&s;t man, who continued to love me the more, the better he knew me. Married when my rea&s;on was matured, I met with nothing that could di&s;turb its &s;erious cour&s;e; and fulfilled my duties with
<PB N="70" REF="034483_0634_0FFDEEBF374AA5D8">
an ardour that was rather the effect of enthu&s;ia&s;m than calculation. By &s;tudying my partner's happine&s;s, I perceived &s;omething was wanting to my own.&mdash; I have never cea&s;ed a moment to con&s;ider my hu&s;|band as one of the mo&s;t e&s;timable men in exi&s;tence, as a man to whom I might be proud of belonging; but I have often felt the di&s;parity between us. I have often felt the a&s;cendancy of an imperious temper, joined to that of twenty years more than I could count, rendered one of tho&s;e advantages a great deal too much. If we lived in &s;olitude, I had &s;ometimes di&s;a|greeable hours to pa&s;s: if we mixed with the world, I was beloved by per&s;ons, &s;ome of whom appeared likely to take too &s;trong a hold of my affections. I immer&s;ed my&s;elf in &s;tudy with my hu&s;band, another exce&s;s by which I was a &s;ufferer: I accu&s;tomed him not to know how to do without me at any time, or on any occa&s;ion whatever.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t year of our marriage entirely at Paris, whither Roland had been &s;ent for by the Board of Trade, who were de&s;irous of making &s;ome new regulations concerning manufactures; regula|tions which the principles of liberty that Roland car|ried with him wherever he went, made him oppo&s;e with all his might. He was printing an account of &s;ome of the arts, which he had written for the aca|demy, and taking a fair copy of his Italian notes. He made me his copyi&s;t and the corrector of the pre&s;s; and I executed the ta&s;k with an humility, at which I
<PB N="71" REF="034483_0635_0FFDEEC22459BD88">
cannot help laughing when I recollect it; and which &s;eems almo&s;t irreconcileable with a mind &s;o much cul|tivated as mine; but it flowed directly from the heart. I had &s;o &s;incere a re&s;pect for my hu&s;band, that I ea&s;ily conceived him to know every thing better than I could. I was at the &s;ame time &s;o much afraid of a cloud on his brow, and <HI>he</HI> was &s;o tenacious of his opinions, that it was long before I acquired &s;ufficient confidence to contradict him. I was then attending a cour&s;e of lectures on natural hi&s;tory, and another on botany; that laborious recreation was the only one I enjoyed after the employment of &s;ecretary and hou&s;e|keeper; for living at ready-furni&s;hed lodgings, as Paris was not our u&s;ual place of re&s;idence, and perceiving that every kind of cookery did not agree with my hu&s;band's delicate con&s;titution, I took care to prepare for him the di&s;hes that &s;uited him be&s;t. We pa&s;&s;ed four years at Amiens; and there I became a mother and a nur&s;e, without cea&s;ing to partake of my hu&s;|band's labours, who had engaged to write a con&s;idera|ble part of the new Encyclopedia. We never &s;tirred from the de&s;k, unle&s;s to take a walk out of the gates of the town. I made a <HI>hortus &s;iccus</HI> of the plants of Picardy; and the &s;tudy of aquatic botany gave birth to <HI>The Peat-digger's Art.</HI> Frequent &s;ickne&s;s alarmed me for Roland's life: my cares were not ineffectual, and &s;erved to &s;trengthen the tie that connected us: he loved me for my boundle&s;s attention; and I was attached to him by the good I did him.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="034483_0636_0FFDEEC4D460FEC8">HE had been acquainted in Italy with a young man, who&s;e gentle and kind di&s;po&s;ition he valued much, and who, after his return to France, where he applied to the &s;tudy of Phy&s;ic, became our particular friend. That was Lanthenas, whom I &s;hould have e&s;teemed more, if the revolution, that touch&s;tone of mankind, by drawing him into the vortex of public affairs, had not expo&s;ed to view his weakne&s;s and his mediocrity. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of private virtues, without per&s;onal accom|pli&s;hments, he rendered him&s;elf very agreeable to my hu&s;band, and attached him&s;elf to us both. I loved him; I treated him like a brother, and gave him the name. I could write largely concerning him, as well as &s;everal intere&s;ting connexions formed at that era, and who &s;till exi&s;t.</P>
<P>SOPHY married, during my re&s;idence at Amiens, the Chevalier de Comicourt, who lived at &s;ix leagues di&s;tance from that place, and farmed his own e&s;tate. Henrietta, who had been fond of M. Roland, and would have found no difficulty in obtaining the con|&s;ent of her family to marry him, made no &s;cruple of approving the preference he had given me, with that affecting &s;incerity which did honour to her di&s;po&s;ition, and with that genero&s;ity that made her &s;o much belov|ed. She married old <HI>De Vouglans,</HI> who was become a widower, and who&s;e confe&s;&s;or and phy&s;ician advi&s;ed him to take another wife, although at the age of &s;eventy-five. Both are widows.

pectoral complaints, which endanger a life nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare of two charming children. The dif|ference of our di&s;po&s;ition and opinions, added to ab|&s;ence, and the cares of the world, have weakened our connexion, without breaking it. Henrietta, al|ways frank, lively, and affectionate, has been to &s;ee me in my captivity, where &s;he would willingly have taken my place to in&s;ure my &s;afety.</P>
<P>ROLAND had de&s;ired, in the early part of our union, that I &s;hould be &s;paring of my vi&s;its to my two friends. I complied with his wi&s;hes; nor did I re&s;ume the liberty of frequenting their &s;ociety till time had in&s;pired my hu&s;band with confidence enough to remove his fears of being rivalled in my affections. Tho&s;e fears were injudicious: a married life is grave and au&s;tere; and if you deprive a woman of &s;en&s;i|bility of the plea&s;ures of friendly intercour&s;e with her own &s;ex, you take away a nece&s;&s;ary comfort, and expo&s;e her to dangers. How long a di&s;&s;ertation would this theme admit of!</P>
<P>IN 1784 we removed to the generality of Lyons, and took up our abode at Villefranche, in M. Ro|land's paternal hou&s;e, where his mother, of the &s;ame age as the century, was living with his elder brother, a canon and coun&s;ellor. Here I &s;hould have nume|rous pictures to paint of the manners of a country town, and their influence, of dome&s;tic cares, and the life I led in the &s;ociety of a woman rendered re&s;pectable by her age, and terrible by her bad tem|per,

and between two brothers, the younger of whom was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of independence, and the el|der accu&s;tomed and inclined to domineer.</P>
<P>DURING two months of the winter we u&s;ed to re|&s;ide at Lyons, with which place I became well ac|quainted, and of which I &s;hould have a great deal to &s;ay&mdash;a city beautifully &s;ituated, and nobly built, flouri&s;hing by its trade and manufactures, intere&s;ting on account of its antiquities and collections of curi|o&s;ities, and re&s;plendent with riches&mdash;a city of which the emperor Jo&s;eph was jealous, and which had the air of a magnificent capital; now a va&s;t burying-place, filled with the victims of a government a thou&s;and times more atrocious than the very de&s;poti&s;m, from the ruins of which it aro&s;e.</P>
<P>WE u&s;ed to go into the country in the autumn; and after the death of my mother-in-law, Madam la Plati&egrave;re, &s;pent there the greater part of the year.

and productive economy; and there I applied &s;ome little knowledge I had acquired to the relief of my neighbours: I became the village doctor, and was the more revered becau&s;e I be&s;towed a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in|&s;tead of requiring a reward, and becau&s;e the plea&s;ure of doing good gave grace to my attentions. How readily does the ru&s;tic labourer grant his confidence to tho&s;e who render him &s;ervice! People pretend he is not grateful; and true it is that I was de&s;irous of laying no one under obligations; but I was beloved; and my departure was lamented with tears. I have al&s;o had &s;ome whim&s;ical &s;cenes. Hone&s;t country|women have brought a hor&s;e for me two or three leagues, begging me to &s;ave the life of &s;ome individual given over by the phy&s;icians. I &s;natched my hu&s;band from the embrace of death in 1789, when all the pre|&s;criptions of the doctors would not have delivered him from a dreadful di&s;ea&s;e without my &s;oothing cares. I pa&s;&s;ed twelve days and nights without &s;leep, and without undre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, and &s;ix months in the unea&s;ine&s;s and agitation of a precarious convale&s;|cence; and yet I was not indi&s;po&s;ed: &s;o much does our &s;trength and activity depend upon the heart. The revolution came, and the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;eized us both: friends to mankind, adored liberty, and think|ing it was regenerating the &s;pecies, and putting an end to the degrading mi&s;ery of that unfortunate cla&s;s, which had &s;o often excited our compa&s;&s;ion, we welcomed it with tran&s;port. Our opinions di&s;|plea&s;ed
<PB N="76" REF="034483_0640_0FFDEECFCBE74D60">
many people at Lyons, who, being accu&s;|tomed to commercial calculations, could not conceive it po&s;&s;ible to favour and applaud changes, only bene|ficial to others, from mere philo&s;ophy. For that &s;ole rea&s;on they became Roland's enemies; and that made the adver&s;e party prize him the more. He was elected one of the municipality at its fir&s;t formation; and exhi|bited in that &s;ituation an inflexible integrity. He was dreaded, and calumny on one &s;ide took the field a|gain&s;t him; whil&s;t on the other he was defended by im|partiality and affection. Being deputed in behalf of the intere&s;ts of the city to the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, he re|paired to Paris, and there we remained the be&s;t part of a year. I have related, in another place, how he became acquainted with &s;everal members of that a&s;&s;embly, con|necting our&s;elves naturally with tho&s;e, who, like us, loved liberty, not for their own &s;ake, but for her's, and who now &s;hare with us the fate common to al|mo&s;t all who have laid the foundations of freedom, as well as to the true friends of human nature; &s;uch as Dion, Socrates, Phocion, and other heroes of antiquity; and Barnevelet and Sydney in modern times.</P>
<P>MY hu&s;band made me accompany him in a tour through England in 1784, and in another through Switzerland in 1787: we were acquainted with in|tere&s;ting individuals in both tho&s;e countries, and continued to keep up a corre&s;pondence with &s;everal. It is not a year &s;ince I received a letter from <HI>Lavater,</HI>

the celebrated clergyman of Zurich, &s;o well known on account of his writings, his brilliant imagination, his affectionate heart, and the purity of his morals. The worthy and learned Go&s;&s;e of Geneva certainly laments the per&s;ecution we undergo. I know not what is become of the able Dezach, formerly a pro|fe&s;&s;or at Vienna, who was lately travelling through Germany, whom I &s;aw frequently at London, and with whom Roland got into an argument at the hou&s;e of Banks, the pre&s;ident of the royal &s;ociety, who u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble at his hou&s;e the &s;cientific of his own country, and the &s;trangers who vi&s;ited London. I travelled with the plea&s;ure and profit derived from the company of a man who has been upon the &s;pot, and &s;een things with an attentive eye: and committed to paper the ob&s;ervations I made on every thing by which I was mo&s;t forcibly &s;truck. I al&s;o vi&s;ited &s;eve|ral parts of France; but the revolution came, and prevented the excur&s;ions which we meditated into the &s;outhern provinces, as well as the tour of Italy, which I had a longing de&s;ire to make. Fondly attached to the public happine&s;s, it engro&s;&s;ed all our ideas, and &s;uper&s;eded all our projects; the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;erving it was, indeed, the only one we felt. The reader has &s;een in the article entitled, <HI>Roland</HI>'s <HI>Fir&s;t Admini&s;tra|tion,</HI> how a &s;hare in the government was conferred upon him, unknown to him&s;elf, as it were; nor will his public conduct fail to prove to impartial po&s;terity, his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, his knowledge, and his virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="034483_0642_0FFDEED539A40310">MY father, with whom we had no great rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed, neither married nor made any very ruinous engagements. We paid a few debts he had contracted, and by granting him an annuity, prevailed on him to leave off bu&s;ine&s;s, in which it was become impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;ucceed. Though &s;uffering &s;o much from his errors, by which my grandmother's little fortune had gone the &s;ame way as every thing el&s;e, and though he had rea&s;on to be highly &s;atisfied with our behaviour, his &s;pirit was too proud not to be hurt at the obligations he owed us. That &s;tate of irritated &s;elf-love often hindered him from doing ju&s;tice, even to tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t de&s;irous of plea&s;ing him. He died, aged upwards of &s;ixty, in the hard winter of 1787, of a catarrh, with which he had been long afflicted. My dear uncle died at Vincennes in 1789; and &s;oon after we lo&s;t my hu&s;band's much-beloved bro|ther. He had made the tour of Switzerland with us, was become prior and rector at Longpont, and was nominated elector of his canton, where he preach|ed liberty, and practi&s;ed the evangelical virtues. The coun&s;ellor and phy&s;ician of his pari&s;hioners, and too wi&s;e for a monk, he was per&s;ecuted by the heads of his order, and had numerous mole&s;tations, which, by their effect on his &s;pirits, contributed to ha&s;ten his end.

<P>ROLAND has been reproached with having &s;olicited letters patent of nobility: the truth is this.&mdash;His fa|mily had enjoyed all the privileges of that order, for &s;everal centuries, by virtue of offices, which did not tran&s;mit them to their heirs, and of the opulence which enabled them to keep up all the <HI>in&s;ignia,</HI> arms, chapel, livery, fief, &amp;c.

He thought he had a right, by his labours, to in&s;ure to his de|&s;cendants an advantage which his ance&s;tors had enjoyed, and which he would have di&s;dained to buy. He accordingly &s;et forth his claims, in order to obtain either the acknowledgment of his nobility, or letters patent of creation.

<P>ROLAND's retiring from the mini&s;try, very &s;hortly after he had &s;aid he would defy the &s;torm, has been imputed as a crime. People do not perceive it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to make known his re&s;olution, in order to keep up the &s;pirits of the weak, and that in this manner he encouraged them on the &s;ixth of January: but the &s;entence of Louis XVI. pronounced on the 18th, &s;hewing the weakne&s;s of the &s;ober party, and the fall of their power in the Convention, he had no longer any &s;upport to hope for, nor any thing to do but to retire, in order that he might not &s;hare the

Certainly Roland abhorred tyranny, and believed Louis guilty; but he wi&s;hed to &s;ee liberty fixed on firm foundations, and thought all was lo&s;t, when he &s;aw that wrong-headed men had gained the a&s;cendance. He is too well ju&s;tified in regard to tho&s;e who are now about to be led to the block!

<P>YOU are a good creature, and de&s;erving every body's love. Your letter is full of &s;en&s;ibility and rea|&s;on; and is calculated to make you friends among worthy people, who &s;hould know nothing of you be|&s;ides. Good inclinations, prudent projects, ju&s;t and natural &s;entiments; the&s;e are the materials of happi|ne&s;s: you po&s;&s;e&s;s them; and no doubt the event will do ju&s;tice to your claims, and give accompli&s;hment to the wi&s;hes of tho&s;e by whom you are beloved. Among them we &s;hall never be the hindmo&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAVE no doubt that a &s;et of in&s;tructions, with the le&s;&s;ons in que&s;tion, would &s;uffice to carry you any length you plea&s;e; nor &s;hould I a&s;k more if I had lei&s;ure; but I &s;tand in need of a ma&s;ter to fix an hour for that kind of &s;tudy, and my ma&s;ter is not punctual to his time: he is be&s;ides a mere machine, with whom it is impo&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on, and who can only move his fingers in order to &s;hew what is to be done. I lo&s;e all patience, and make but little progre&s;s. I cannot even play the mu&s;ic you &s;elected for me, which is in general ea&s;y; but the &s;impleton likes better to make me &s;tudy what he is ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, and I am obliged to &s;ub|mit, that my time and my money may not be altogether thrown away.</P>

<P>IT is a nocturnal greeting I &s;end you this time. It is half pa&s;t eight, and the moment of a country &s;up|per cannot be far off; but I can always find time to devote to your &s;ervice. Do not imagine, however, I am going to tire you to death with an endle&s;s epi&s;tle: you have no time to lo&s;e, and I will not &s;pend mine in a way burden&s;ome to any body, much le&s;s to my friends. This principle being e&s;tabli&s;hed, nothing re|mains but to come to the point; and that is what I would &s;till avoid doing to the end of the fourth page by way of tea&s;ing <HI>you</HI> and amu&s;ing <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> if it were not right for &s;uch fancies to give way to rea&s;on.&mdash;The &s;ervice of this Dame Rea&s;on is by no means an ea&s;y one.&mdash;Whatever truth there may be in my reflection, which you will take for the whim of the moment, you mu&s;t know that Mon&s;ieur Maille, haberda&s;her of hard-wares, in the <HI>Rue des Lombards,</HI> deals in that famous <HI>dogs'-gra&s;s,</HI> which has &s;o much puzzled the doctors, your&s;elf not excepted&mdash;the dogs'-gra&s;s u&s;ed by bru&s;h-makers, which I, poor ignorant woman, often make u&s;e of without entering into an analy&s;is of its nature. But there mu&s;t be food &s;uited to every &s;tomach; and people are &s;o accu&s;tomed to look for &s;cience in dictionaries, that it would occa&s;ion a terri|ble

outcry indeed, if none were to be put into a work of this kind, in which by the way, there is now and then a want of it. Be good enough, then, to call on Mon&s;ieur Maille, and, like a philo&s;opher who knows how to extract information out of every thing, for once let a &s;hop-keeper in&s;truct you. You will a&s;k him whence he procures that commodity, what he thinks of its nature, and of the preparation it may have undergone, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to teach you your le&s;&s;on; for you certainly are not one of tho&s;e, who, as the poet Sadi &s;ays, know not even how to inquire.&mdash;In &s;aying this, I do not intend to pay you a compliment; but to expre&s;s a truth which flows &s;pon|taneou&s;ly from my pen.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it is now two or three long days &s;ince we have been favoured with any thing from you in the &s;hape of a letter. We &s;hould be glad to know whether you have received <HI>The Peat-digger's Art:</HI> the de&s;ire of the author mu&s;t have been ill complied with, if the work was not delivered to you on Wedne&s;day la&s;t: you were the fir&s;t per&s;on to whom it was di&s;|patched.</P>
<P>WE have been very bu&s;y the&s;e two days in digging, hoeing, and &s;owing our little garden. We mean to fill it with flowers, not with pretty ones according to the general idea, but with &s;uch as are intere&s;ting in the eyes of the botani&s;t. We are doing great things, I a&s;&s;ure you!</P>

<P>IS it not enough to leave the poor women di&s;con|&s;olate, without &s;ending them to the devil into the bargain? Young man, you are not tolerant; but as there is &s;omething laughable in your malice, it is forgiven you, and we only infer, that you would rather come in the way of all the <HI>prickly hollies</HI> in the univer&s;e, than in that of Madam Maille. After this, very po&s;&s;ibly, your friends may beg you to wander about the fields and bu&s;hes for information, but nothing more. They find, however, your di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s much to their advantage; and while that is the motive of your conduct, have the greater rea&s;on to depend on your per&s;everance.</P>
<P>YOUR giving me a de&s;cription of your laborious life an&s;wers very little purpo&s;e: I do not pity you at all. In my opinion, to be bu&s;y is to be half|way towards happine&s;s, e&s;pecially when it is a mean of pre&s;erving our liberty: for when once we can get rid of the empire of habit, we are little expo&s;ed to that of love. Flutter then, at your ea&s;e, about the woods and &s;hrubberies, like a coqueti&s;h &s;parrow, yet a &s;tranger to &s;lavery: it may be long avoided by &s;uch a way of life, and the mind will gain propor|tionable &s;trength. I only pity you for not being able to divert your&s;elf the&s;e en&s;uing holydays, and &s;hall think of you every time we go to take our walk, in which you will be our ideal companion.</P>

<P>YOU are &s;ad, and we are quite afflicted at it! Nobody, mo&s;t certainly, can better conceive how much rea&s;on, with your delicate way of thinking, you mu&s;t have to be &s;o. It is painful to &s;ee the &s;eeds of malevolence, or of any thing like it, growing in the hearts of tho&s;e about us; and a generous mind regrets it the more, when it is owing to &s;ome external advantage. It would be ea&s;ier for &s;uch a man to &s;et him&s;elf above po&s;itive inju&s;tice, than to overcome the vexation of afflicting the per&s;ons around him, by any &s;uperiority not intrin&s;ically his own. That very di&s;po&s;ition, however, ought to procure him his par|don for many advantages; and, indeed, it &s;eldom happens, the &s;elf-love of rivals and competitors is much hurt by tho&s;e of which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or does not avail him&s;elf in an overbearing manner. That kind of di&s;content that many per&s;ons feel at the promotion of a fortunate individual, is, be&s;ides, one of the evils attendant on &s;ociety; and in the&s;e ca&s;es, a man mu&s;t re&s;olve to bear what he cannot avoid.</P>
<P>OUR friend has written you a letter to-day, which will be delivered by Mon&s;ieur de Vin, who&s;e de|parture for Paris is fixed for this evening. He is an excellent man, of a truly hone&s;t and feeling heart, who&s;e friends reproach him with nothing but indolence, which prevents his &s;hewing what he is worth, and availing him&s;elf of his talents. But
<PB N="93" REF="034483_0657_0FFDEEFCCD6EDF90">
I could willingly reproach him with talking too much on new&s;paper politics, which tire me to death, and keeping to him&s;elf all he knows on the <HI>belles-lettres,</HI> of which I am &s;o fond: but every one mu&s;t follow his inclinations. I am glad you have all tho&s;e of a &s;ound mind, and all that can &s;atisfy an active di&s;po&s;ition. It is having materials for happine&s;s, and arms again&s;t melancholy, from which the indolent cannot deliver them&s;elves with equal advantage.</P>

<P>YOU have too much &s;oul for any one to reproach you with having &s;en&s;es; it would at lea&s;t be an ab&s;ur|dity. It is extremely natural at five-and-twenty to forget Ari&s;totle, for the &s;ake of a pair of fine eyes; and it would be very &s;trange, if, at a female tribunal, you were not held pardonable for &s;uch an offence. I am well content likewi&s;e, to make up all our other quarrels.</P>
<P>I COULD not help &s;miling at your earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee M. de Vin. Your active friend&s;hip mea&s;ures that of other people by it&s;elf; but the worthy M. de Vin is the la&s;t man in the world to perceive all tho&s;e little things which intere&s;t you, becau&s;e your heart &s;ets a value upon them; nor do I doubt but you would learn more from our brief corre&s;pondence, than he would by vi&s;iting us day after day. I &s;hould not be a&s;toni&s;hed if he were to pa&s;s three weeks at Paris

without &s;eeing you, although he really de&s;ires it; for he is a man likely to &s;pend one half of his life in plan|ning the very contrary of what he will execute in the other: a kind hone&s;t-hearted creature notwith&s;tand|ing, and well calculated to make a &s;en&s;ible woman happy.</P>
<P>YOUR maidens of Poitou do not at all re&s;emble our young ladies of Amiens. The latter have all the a&s;|&s;urance of a woman with whom ba&s;hfulne&s;s has long been out of the que&s;tion; talk quite as loud in com|pany; game as &s;oon as they are in their teens; and at that early time of life, play off all the airs and graces of dam&s;els hackneyed in the ways of the world. It is truly farcical; but there are luckily a few remark|able exceptions.</P>
<P>I WOULD almo&s;t lay a wager that you are an adept at ninepins. We have already played &s;ome famous matches with my daughter; but the little &s;impleton throws the bowl on one &s;ide: in &s;ober &s;adne&s;s, if &s;he never takes better aim, &s;he will be a poor creature; but patience is nece&s;&s;ary for every thing; as you have oc|ca&s;ion for it to bear &s;tudy, confinement, and the rain when it overtakes you in the fields. But God be prai&s;ed! &s;ince you &s;till have time left to &s;ay a few words on the &s;ubject of friend&s;hip, and an inclination to retain that &s;entiment, in &s;pite of the rogui&s;h tricks of the urchin who gives you &s;uch mental ab|&s;ences, when you are in company with the Abb&eacute;'s &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>WE received your la&s;t letter ye&s;terday with much plea&s;ure: this indemnification for the ab&s;ence of our friends is a great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>ARE you indebted for the recovery of your liberty in the evening to a decrea&s;e of official bu&s;ine&s;s, or to the kindne&s;s of one of your colleagues? The latter cau&s;e would be the more agreeable, as well as the more la&s;ting.</P>
<P>THANKS to your information, we know what to think of the tran&s;lation of Ari&s;totle. However e&s;tima|ble the work may be, the pre&s;ent edition is above our purcha&s;e; we have no occa&s;ion for the Greek text, and can do very well without a cumber&s;ome <HI>quarto.</HI> We &s;hall therefore wait for a mode&s;t <HI>octavo</HI> without the text, which will probably be publi&s;hed hereafter, and which will &s;uit us a great deal better.

<P>THERE was &s;o much agreeable chit-chat in your la&s;t, that I could not help thinking we had you &s;itting by our &s;ide. I admire you for placing to the account of coldne&s;s what would &s;eem to be the fruit of wi&s;|dom; for &s;urely it is the highe&s;t property of it to &s;ee no more than what is vi&s;ible, and to keep reality clear of all illu&s;ions: the circum&s;tance that carried you to that height &s;ignifies little&mdash;&s;o much the better, if, in order to reach it, you had no occa&s;ion for efforts and trials: your mind has received no &s;hock, and your energy has not been wa&s;ted. Whatever cour&s;e we pur&s;ue, we may go a great length, provided imagina|tion does not come acro&s;s our way, but remain &s;ubor|dinate to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>M. DE VIN told us &s;omething about the parliamen|tary &s;atires. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Paris is a cu|rious place: puns and pamphlets are there the re&s;ult or the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;erious affairs; and good and evil are turned into ridicule alike, as &s;ome kind of con&s;olation for the exi&s;tence of the one, and the im|po&s;&s;ibility of the other.</P>
<P>YOU would no longer then make one in a game at pri&s;on-bars? But if a Sophy were to be the prize of contention in the race, could you not find legs as good as tho&s;e of <HI>Emile?</HI> I am not at all &s;orry for the rain which made you leave off botanizing, and take up your pen; but I wi&s;h you would avail your|&s;elf

of the pre&s;ent fine weather, and &s;et off on another excur&s;ion. It is in my opinion one of the mo&s;t charming occupations po&s;&s;ible: it calls forth the ac|tivity of youth; favours the reveries of the pen&s;ive mind; enables us to enjoy all the plea&s;ures of the country, and all the agreeable ideas it in&s;pires; and affords gratification alike to tender melancholy, and to &s;portive gaiety. We &s;trolled ye&s;terday along the ditches of the city, and found a few plants; but I am as yet &s;o un&s;kilful; I have &s;o little time to rub away the ru&s;t of ignorance; and the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ulting books which are not portable, and which I have little lei&s;ure to turn over at home, occurs &s;o often, that I &s;hould be out of all patience if my ta&s;te for the &s;tudy did not overcome the di&s;gu&s;t occa&s;ioned by my mi&s;|takes.</P>

<P>I DO not know what is the day of the month: all I can tell you is, that we are in the month of June, that ye&s;terday was a holyday, and that, according to our reckoning here, it is three o'clock in the afternoon. On Sunday I had a vi&s;it from my good man, who left me again ye&s;terday evening. I pa&s;&s;ed a very bad night, and was &s;o ill this morning, that I could not write to you, although it was very much my intention. I do not give you this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events as nece&s;&s;a|rily re&s;ulting from one another; but I relate things fairly and hone&s;tly as they are. Your letters were
<PB N="100" REF="034483_0664_0FFDEF0A6FB8A4F0">
communicated to me, becau&s;e we number the re|ceipt of them among our enjoyments, and becau&s;e we cannot ta&s;te any plea&s;ure without &s;haring it between us. I have nothing to &s;end you in return for your news: I do not trouble my head about politics; I am no longer in the way of picking up any of another kind, and can only entertain you with an account of the dogs that wake me, of the birds that con&s;ole me for not being able to get to &s;leep again, of the cherry-trees that are oppo&s;ite my windows, and of the heifers that graze before the door.</P>
<P>I RESIDE under the roof of a woman, whom the want of &s;ome object on which I might fix my affec|tions, made me di&s;tingui&s;h, when, at eleven years of age, I was in a convent, with forty other girls, who thought of nothing but romping, to di&s;pel the gloom of the cloi&s;ter. I was devout, like Madam Guyon in days of yore; I attached my&s;elf to a companion, who was a little my&s;tical al&s;o; and our friend&s;hip was fed by the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility that made us love God Al|mighty to di&s;traction. That companion, after her return to her own country, made me acquainted with M. Roland, by intru&s;ting him with the delivery of her letters. Judge whether what has followed ought not to make me love and cheri&s;h the accidental cau&s;e which gave it birth.</P>
<P>THIS friend, in &s;hort, is lately married; and I had &s;ome &s;hare in inducing her &s;o to do. I am now vi&s;iting her in the country, which I have
<PB N="101" REF="034483_0665_0FFDEF0C230EDE68">
often repre&s;ented to her as the abode be&s;t &s;uited to a virtuous mind. I walk over her e&s;tate; I count her poultry; we gather the fruit her garden produces; and are of opinion that all this is well worth the gravity with which fa&s;hionable folks &s;it round the card-table; the important bu&s;ine&s;s of dre&s;&s;ing, in which it is nece&s;&s;ary to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> half the day, in order to &s;pend the re&s;t in tire&s;ome company; the prittle-prattle of petit-maitres, &amp;c. &amp;c. But notwith&s;tanding all this, I feel a longing de&s;ire to return to Amiens, becau&s;e only one half of me is here; my friend for|gives me, becau&s;e her hu&s;band being ab&s;ent, &s;he is the better able to judge of my privations by her own; and although we find it very comfortable to condole with one another, we are perfectly of opinion, that to be at a di&s;tance from the dovecot, or to be there alone, is a very mi&s;erable thing. I am, neverthele&s;s, to pa&s;s the whole of next week here: I do not know whether my health will be as much benefited by it, as my good man was inclined to hope. I have, how|ever, laid all &s;tudy a&s;ide for the&s;e three days, with|out feeling yet any wonderful advantage. I was pretty well &s;atisfied with the looks of our friend: I dread his clo&s;et, as I dread fire; and the week I have yet to pa&s;s here, &s;eems an eternity, on account of the mi&s;chief he may do him&s;elf in the mean time.</P>
<P>MUST I not have great confidence in your indul|gence, to entertain you with &s;uch ru&s;tic prate? I expect you, however, not to be obliged to me for

<P>IT is enough that you lay down your arms: I do not require you to give them up: I will not

&s;uffer any one to impo&s;e laws upon me; nor do I wi&s;h to domineer. You were not mi&s;taken as to the preten&s;ions of your &s;ex, I will even &s;ay as to their rights; but you were much mi&s;taken in the way you took to defend them. Neither did you lay them open to my attacks; for it is not my intention to at|tack any one of them: you forgot the <HI>mode,</HI> that was all. What el&s;e is the deference, the re&s;pect paid by your &s;ex to mine, but the indulgence &s;hewn by power|ful magnanimity to the weak whom it protects, and to whom it does honour at the &s;ame time? When you a&s;&s;ume the tone of a ma&s;ter, you make us immediately think that we are able to re&s;i&s;t you, and perhaps to do more, notwith&s;tanding all your &s;trength. (The in|vulnerable Achilles was not invulnerable every where.) Do you pay us homage? It is Alexander treating his pri&s;oners, who are not ignorant of their dependence, with the re&s;pect due to queens. In this &s;ingle parti|cular, perhaps, our civilization goes hand in hand with nature: the laws place us in a &s;tate of almo&s;t con&s;tant &s;ubjection; while cu&s;tom grants us all the little honours of &s;ociety: we are nothing in effect; in appearance we are every thing.</P>
<P>DO not then any longer imagine that I form a fal&s;e e&s;timate of what <HI>we</HI> have a right to require, or of what it becomes <HI>you</HI> to claim. I believe, I will not &s;ay more than any woman, but as much as any man, in the &s;uperiority of your &s;ex. In the fir&s;t place you

have &s;trength, with all the advantages that belong to it, and all that it confers; courage, per&s;everance, ex|ten&s;ive views, and great talents: it belongs to you to make political laws, as well as &s;cientific di&s;coveries. Govern the world; change the &s;urface of the globe; be magnanimous, terrible, &s;kilful, and learned: you are all this without our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and this, no doubt, makes you our ma&s;ters. But without us you would be neither virtuous, nor kind, nor amiable, nor happy: keep then to your&s;elves glory and authority of every kind; we neither have nor de&s;ire any empire but over manners, nor any throne but in your hearts. Further than this I &s;hall never extend my claims. I am &s;ome|times &s;orry to &s;ee women contend with you for cer|tain privileges which become them &s;o ill: there is not one of tho&s;e privileges, even to the title of author, that does not &s;eem to me ridiculous in female hands. Great as their powers may be in certain re&s;pects, it is not to the public that their talents or their know|ledge ought to be exhibited.</P>
<P>TO make a &s;ingle per&s;on happy, and to bind a num|ber together by the charms of friend&s;hip, and by winning ways, is, in my mind, the mo&s;t enviable de&s;|tiny that can be conceived. Let us have no more contention; no more war: let us live in peace. Only recollect, that to keep the high ground you &s;tand upon, in relation to womankind, you mu&s;t be cautious of making them feel your &s;uperiority. The war in which I have engaged you for the &s;ake of amu&s;ement,

and with all the freedom of an old acquaintance, would be carried on in a more &s;erious manner by an artful coquet; nor would you leave the field without a wound. Protect always, that you may only &s;ub|mit when you plea&s;e; that is the &s;ecret of your &s;ex. But what a pretty &s;impleton am I to be telling you this, and all the re&s;t of it, which you know &s;o much better than I do! You wi&s;hed to make me prattle; well! we are even. Adieu!</P>

<P>IT is long, my worthy friend, &s;ince I had the plea|&s;ure of conver&s;ing with you through the medium of the po&s;t; but I have &s;o much to do, and &s;o much re&s;t to take, that I begin a thou&s;and things without fini&s;h|ing one. The days pa&s;&s;ed at Cre&s;py were completely filled up by friend&s;hip, in the fir&s;t place, and after|ward by vi&s;iting, and excur&s;ions in the country. Of our excur&s;ions, that to Ermenonville was not the lea&s;t intere&s;ting: much taken up with you, and with the things to be &s;een, we enjoyed the latter, while regret|ting the want of your company. The place in it&s;elf, the valley in which Ermenonville is &s;ituated, is the mo&s;t mi&s;erable thing in the world; &s;and on the high grounds, a mora&s;s below; black and muddy water; no pro&s;pect; not a &s;ingle view from the fields of any thing like a rich and cultivated country; woods on which you are in a manner buried, and low mar&s;hy
<PB N="107" REF="034483_0671_0FFDEF1D67782FE0">
meadows: &s;uch is the nature of the place. But art has conducted, di&s;tributed, and confined the water, and cut avenues through the woods, and from both there re&s;ult a melancholy and affecting &s;cene, plea&s;|ing points of view, and parts highly picture&s;que. The i&s;land of poplars, in the mid&s;t of a noble piece of water, &s;urrounded with trees, is the mo&s;t agreeable and mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;pot in all Ermen|onville, independently even of the object that has &s;o much attraction for feeling hearts and pen&s;ive minds. The entrance into the wood, the manner in which the ca&s;tle offers it&s;elf to the eye, and the laying out of the water in front of it, compo&s;e the next piece of &s;cenery by which I was mo&s;t forcibly &s;truck. I was plea&s;ed to find in&s;criptions engraved on &s;tones &s;cattered here and there; but the ruins, and edifices erected in a variety of places, have, in ge|neral, the defect with which I reproach almo&s;t all tho&s;e imitations in the Engli&s;h gardens: it is that of being con&s;tructed on too &s;mall a &s;cale, by which means the illu&s;ion is de&s;troyed, and they produce an effect that borders on the ridiculous. Ermenonville, in &s;hort, does not di&s;play tho&s;e &s;plendid beauties that a&s;toni&s;h the traveller; but I think it mu&s;t plea&s;e the inhabitant who frequents it every day. If <HI>Jean-Ja|ques</HI> however had not given it celebrity, I doubt whe|ther any one would have gone out of his way to pay it a vi&s;it. We went into the ma&s;ter's room, which is no longer inhabited, and in which Rou&s;&s;eau mu&s;t

<P>IT would be a tedious &s;tory if I were to tell you all I have experienced from my leaving Paris to my arrival here. Poor Eudora did not remember her afflicted mother, who expected to be forgotten, and who wept neverthele&s;s like a child on finding it the ca&s;e. Alas! &s;aid I to my&s;elf, I am like the mothers who do not &s;uckle their children. I have de&s;erved, however, more than they, and yet I am no better off. The &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the habit of &s;eeing me, has broken that of affection, by which this little crea|ture was attached to me.......Whenever I think of it, my heart is ready to bur&s;t. My child, however, has re&s;umed her cu&s;tomary manners, and care&s;&s;es me as before; but I dare no longer believe in the &s;entiment, from which tho&s;e care&s;&s;es derived their value. I wi&s;h &s;he were &s;till in want of milk, and that I had milk to give her.</P>
<P>DO you, whom we count among the deare&s;t of our friends, remember tho&s;e whom you are no longer in the habit of &s;eeing? Adieu!&mdash;I mu&s;t conclude: we &s;alute you affectionately.</P>

Obliged to at|tend to bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf, in preference to epi&s;tolary chit-chat, however agreeable it may be, our friend de&s;ires me to a&s;&s;ure you, that he will &s;hortly &s;end an an&s;wer to the academy, to which you have ju&s;t had the kindne&s;s to make him known.

In that re&s;pect I &s;olicit the interference of your friend&s;hip, and tru&s;t to it to plead my cau&s;e with M. Brou&s;&s;onnet, on whom I cannot my&s;elf have any particular claim.

it immediately. My brother-in-law was ju&s;t gone by with two friends, who could not delay their journey to London, where we &s;hall probably be in time to overtake them; my good man was &s;etting off him&s;elf, with his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, to make the circuit of the depart|ment; and I remained at home with the bachelor, and all the bu&s;tle of a great wa&s;h, a thing of no &s;mall importance in country hou&s;e-keeping. I did not think our friend had left you in doubt as to the de&s;tination of the copies: there is a complete one of all his works for the academy; another of his letters only for the Count de Saluces; and a third, I believe, of tho&s;e letters al&s;o for M.

I have inquired and endeavoured to find out, to no purpo&s;e yet, whether there be any uncommon kinds of fi&s;h in our rivers and pools: the people of this country po&s;&s;e&s;s no more &s;cience in that re&s;pect than their cooks; and although I intend to make farther re&s;earches, I have no hopes of furni&s;hing any thing for your friend's Ichthyology.

but we went to his &s;hop with Mon&s;ieur Dezach, and I not only explained your intentions, but communi|cated to him your own words concerning the diameter, the focus, and the magnifying power of the <HI>lens.</HI> Dol|lond replied, that it was very difficult to combine tho&s;e proportions with the effect required; that he had nothing of the kind ready made, but that he would do it in the be&s;t way he was able. It took him &s;everal days, at the end of which he gave us your magnifier, as the re&s;ult of his labour, to guide him in which, the properties required had been left with him in Engli&s;h. I &s;end you the&s;e particulars, not with a view of proving that I have done my be&s;t, for that I am &s;ure you will not doubt; but to con&s;ole you for what is, by the impo&s;&s;ibility of its being otherwi&s;e. On the other hand, I have to inform you for your &s;atisfac|tion, that Eudora knew us on our return, although &s;he was in bed, and though we appeared to her as if in a dream. She ki&s;&s;ed me with a kind of gravity mixed with affection; and then uttered a faint cry of &s;urpri&s;e and joy on perceiving her father. She had been in great health, and had not met with the &s;mall|e&s;t accident during our ab&s;ence; but next morning, while running about, &s;he fell, and rolled down &s;tairs in &s;uch a way that I thought her dead, and was little better my&s;elf. I found at la&s;t that &s;he was not at all hurt, and &s;oon got the better of my fright. In the mean time our friend, for whom the journey had done wonders, found him&s;elf much fatigued on his re|turn,

and has &s;ince been tormented by an unfortunate tumor, which has made me very unhappy. To-morrow mean to make him take phy&s;ic, with pti&s;ans, accord|ing to the old pre&s;criptions. I never think of him who gave them to us, of the nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to them, of my friend, of you, and of all the circum&s;tan|ces this brings to mind, without being much affected. Another perhaps would be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, for fear of affecting you al&s;o; but I feel I partake too much of what my friends &s;uffer, not to make them partakers in all that concerns me, e&s;pecially in things that are almo&s;t reciprocal.</P>
<P>BY way of changing the theme for &s;omething more agreeable, I mu&s;t tell you that while making our ar|rangements, and packing up, a <HI>Chevalier</HI> de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. He was come to &s;ee the hou&s;e, and according to military u&s;age, took the oppor|tunity of paying his re&s;pects to the mi&s;tre&s;s of it. He is a good kind of man; but his com|pliments, and all the in&s;ipid things which &s;uch people call gallantry, put me &s;o out of patience, that I &s;et down to write to you by way of getting rid of him, and turned him over to our friend, who will not have done with &s;uch a chatterbox in a hurry. It is but fair, however, that in all well-regulated families, each per&s;on &s;hould take his &s;hare of the burden, and this is one that I re&s;ign to abler hands.</P>
<P>THIS reminds me of an Engli&s;h comedy I &s;aw re|pre&s;ented at London. A French <HI>petit maitre</HI> was in|troduced,

and occa&s;ioned a hearty laugh, in which we were ready to join. I &s;end you no account of a journey that has given me great &s;atisfaction: we will talk it over when we meet, which will be infinitely preferable. We employed our time as you may imagine; I &s;eized a few ha&s;ty moments to write, and &s;hall ever remember with plea&s;ure a country of which Delolme taught me to love the con&s;titution, and where I have witne&s;&s;ed the happy effects which that con&s;titution has produced. Fools may chatter and &s;laves may &s;ing, but you may take my word for it, that England contains men who have a right to laugh at us. I have it in my power to tell you &s;ome curious particulars of Lavater, with whom M. Dezach pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>AT length we live under the &s;ame &s;ky with you, and love you as much as ever, like true friends, who&s;e device you know is, <HI>far</HI> and <HI>near, &s;ummer</HI> and <HI>winter.</HI></P>

You will probably be of opinion, that the young &s;olitary maid, who thus &s;tudied his character while reading his works, began by not hating him; and you will not be deceived.

We flattered our&s;elves, I confe&s;s, we &s;hould find a letter from you here, or receive one &s;oon after our arrival, for we wrote to you from Dijon al&s;o; and are as much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by your &s;ilence now, as we were afflicted by your tears. Obdurate man, who&s;e imagination does us all &s;o much harm, why do you refu&s;e to open your heart to truth, to confidence, and to friend&s;hip, &s;o long tried? It is in vain you oppo&s;e to them the illu|&s;ions by which you &s;uffer your&s;elf to be deceived: the frankne&s;s of our affection cannot fail to bring you back to our arms.

Open your eyes, my good friend, and turn them on the worthy people who love you; who could never find any thing but rea&s;ons to love you more and more, and who de&s;ire nothing &s;o much as the renewal of your attachment. We arrived here without accident, but much fatigued: our brother was come to meet us, and we immediately &s;et about opening trunks, and packing up anew, in order to go into the country, where we now are. I have not the heart to &s;peak to you of any thing rela|tive to the per&s;ons I have about me, till you have given me &s;igns of life. You have learnt from our friends that we have &s;een M.

Be it as it may, you will find us ever the &s;ame, and the day perhaps will come, when you will &s;ay, that people who&s;e attachment to you had been of an ordinary kind, would not have been capable of taking &s;o much trouble, and &s;o con&s;tantly to per&s;evere in it, to per&s;uade you to the contrary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;eems inaccurate; but it is rendered exactly from the original.</NOTE>.

<P>MY good man is ju&s;t &s;et off for a circuit in the mountains of his department, and is afterwards to make a &s;hort &s;tay at Lyons, &s;o that I &s;hall be ten days at lea&s;t, perhaps a fortnight, without &s;eeing him. The hou&s;e is full of workmen; and my apart|ment is nearly fini&s;hed; but much remains to be done to the In&s;pector's &s;tudy. We &s;hall have things of this kind to attend to for a long while; and I am &s;adly afraid le&s;t the ma&s;ons, over whom it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep an eye, &s;hould prevent our going in the &s;um|mer to botanize on Mount Pila. Our friend Lanthe|nas, who left us the third of this month, mu&s;t have mentioned us to you more than once, and has a great deal to &s;ay &s;till, if he means to execute the whole of his commi&s;&s;ion. My little Eudora prattles more than ever, and I am extremely plea&s;ed to &s;ee that &s;he grows more and more fond of my company, and will no longer con&s;ent to leave me. She called to me to-night to a&s;k where you were, and whether you were not to come and &s;ee us. In playing about us &s;he has already learnt a part of her alphabet, and whenever I take up a

I have had little lei|&s;ure &s;ince my arrival here; for you mu&s;t know it is the cu&s;tom to vi&s;it the new comers; and I &s;hould already have had the whole town with me, if &s;everal per&s;ons were not &s;till in the country, which prevents their vi&s;its being over quite &s;o &s;oon as they would otherwi&s;e have been: be&s;ides, my mother-in-law keeps a great deal of company; but I &s;lip away the moment they &s;it down to cards to our good brother's &s;tudy, and there we read the journals, or whatever el&s;e comes to hand; conver&s;e on literary &s;ubjects, or concert plans for the future, with &s;o much friend|&s;hip and unre&s;erve, that &s;upper always comes too &s;oon. I mu&s;t beg you to procure me Bemerzrieder's Le&s;&s;ons of Harmony for the harp&s;ichord, in quarto, of which you once bought a copy for a friend of mine; but I am in no hurry; for I have no harp&s;i|chord, and it is an acqui&s;ition not quite &s;o ea&s;y to make. My hu&s;band will have other matters to com|municate to you on his return. We left the country at the moment when an untimely fall of &s;now had produced a great change in the &s;cenery around us. If the nece&s;&s;ity, however, of making our arrange|ments had not called us to town, we &s;hould have been in no great ha&s;te to come here. The news of the war gives me pain, becau&s;e I always con&s;ider the&s;e quar|rels of kings as ruinous to the people; and I regret it the more, &s;ince it gives you particular cau&s;e of un|ea&s;ine&s;s.

Do not tear the letters you may have written to me in the fulne&s;s of your heart; every thing that i&s;&s;ues thence is as grateful and as dear to me as it ever was.

Her mind continues to develope it&s;elf more and more, and I tru&s;t that her heart will be no &s;tranger to &s;oft and vir|tuous affections.</P>
<P>IF you knew how angry I am with my&s;elf, on ac|count of an opportunity I have lo&s;t, I think you could not help pitying me. A friend whom we had at Rome, came and pa&s;&s;ed four-and-twenty hours with us on his way to Paris, where he means to &s;ettle; and I was to have given him the &s;kins we bought for you at Dijon. But his fellow-travellers carried him off &s;ooner than he expected, for his intention was to &s;tay at lea&s;t two days; the &s;kins were left behind, and I was angry at my forgetfulne&s;s an hour after the po&s;t-chai&s;e had driven off. If you knew of any other channel, I imagine you would point it out to me; but I cannot de&s;cribe to you the rage I was in. We talked of you, of La|vater, and of a thou&s;and agreeable things.

Le Monnier, who, if I mi&s;take not, is to alight at M. Vincent's, of the academy, is quite full of Italy, which he has ju&s;t vi&s;ited the &s;econd time. He is a man of gentle and agreeable manners; is acquaint|ed with Mon&s;ieur Rome de l'I&s;le; and like all tho&s;e who know that worthy character, holds him in the highe&s;t e&s;teem: the children of the arts are allied by nature to tho&s;e of the &s;ciences.</P>
<P>I HEAR pretty frequently from our friend Lanthe|nas, without knowing any more than your&s;elf how his projects go on. Perhaps he does not know him|&s;elf: he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be much dependent on cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I TAKE it very kindly of you to have been at the pains of procuring me certain accounts of Agatha. I do not return you thanks for it, becau&s;e I place all your attentions to the account of friend&s;hip; they are engraven on my heart, though my mouth pa&s;&s;es them over in &s;ilence.

<P>WELL! my good friend, how are you going on? In what &s;tate are your health, bu&s;ine&s;s, connexions, and &s;tudy? Are all the&s;e things as you could wi&s;h, as we &s;hould de&s;ire, and as we could contribute to make them, as far as relates to friend&s;hip at lea&s;t, if our hearts were known to you? But why &s;hould I again make a doubt of it? Let us &s;ay no more on the &s;ubject, but act with confidence in each other.</P>
<P>I HAVE received the inclo&s;ed draft from Lyons, in order to tran&s;mit it to Paris; and you are the per|&s;on I have pitched upon, becau&s;e there is nobody to whom we would &s;ooner be under an obligation. I beg you to receive the amount, and to procure in ex|change a good bill, upon Lyons or Villefranche, of equal value. I &s;uppo&s;e you will get one more ea&s;ily on the former town; or what perhaps would be better

<P>EUDORA is perfectly well: her &s;trength and gaiety are as brilliant as ever, and her mind makes a con|&s;iderable progre&s;s. I am better al&s;o; and am in daily expection of &s;eeing my good man. We have no news here, except the efferve&s;cence in the minds of the Lyonne&s;e, on account of the election of a new Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t des Marchands, and the intrigues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ires cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The weather is horri|bly cold; our roads over the mountains are unpa&s;&s;a|ble; and the others are not much better.</P>
<P>OUR friend is at pre&s;ent much taken up with the academy at Lyons.&mdash;The academy has, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, numbered him among its a&s;&s;ociates. The &s;tudy is not yet arranged; and a &s;ad thing it is to have any thing to do in &s;o rigorous a &s;ea&s;on. It is &s;ome time &s;ince I heard from our friend Lanthenas. He is returned to his father's, and owing to his hav|ing a great deal of occupation, is a little in arrears in his epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence: he regrets it much in regard to you, and de&s;ired me to tell you he would make amends the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>SAY a thou&s;and kind and affectionate things for me to your dear &s;i&s;ter; and as many more to the ex|cellent Mon&s;ieur Parault. The &s;hepherd Sylvain has been &s;adly treated on account of his work &s;aved from the deluge: the <HI>Ann&eacute;e Literaire</HI> has la&s;hed him ter|ribly.

It appears to me that you <HI>lavaterize</HI> perfectly well with the <HI>Counte&s;s,</HI> and that you have a va&s;t field for ob&s;er|vation to go over. You ought by this time to be an adept. Tell me then what you have di&s;covered or re|cognized in our portraits. I wi&s;h much to know whe|ther you will divine aright, and more e&s;pecially what my countenance be&s;peaks. Your idea of the original is perhaps a little confu&s;ed: you were not a doctor of phy&s;iognomy when you had an opportunity of examin|ing it, and the veil is now a hundred leagues thick; but I &s;hall be the better able to judge whether our portraits be well drawn. Speak to me frankly on the &s;ubject: I cannot, however, help telling you beforehand, that either you are a very bad di&s;ciple of Lava|ter,
<PB N="137" REF="034483_0701_0FFDEF6D26F4C358">
or the portraits in que&s;tion are very little like, if you do not find in them the lines that charac|terize true friends. I thought I had written you word that our friend Lanthenas was very bu&s;y, and that he had commi&s;&s;ioned me to tell you not to be &s;ur|pri&s;ed, if you &s;hould be &s;ome &s;hort time without hear|ing from him: he has &s;uffered twelve long days to pa&s;s without writing us a line. We have received the two tran&s;lations of the worthy M. Parault. The fir&s;t I under&s;tand very well; but as to the other, <HI>I</HI> am quite lo&s;t in it: it would be nece&s;&s;ary to be able to &s;ay with Swedenborg, <HI>I have &s;een</HI> this &s;ame intellectual world. A-propos of &s;eeing&mdash;our family is very ill provided with the means: we have all bad eyes. Tho&s;e of the grandmother, the two &s;ons, and the daughter-in-law, are all inflamed, and we all complain alike of a burning and &s;hooting pain. What is &s;till wor&s;e is, that we have not been laughing like you: we are not very gay when we cannot &s;ee why, and are almo&s;t tempted to be melancholy.</P>
<P>YOU may make the mo&s;t you can of this &s;tyle, one half proper, and one half figurative: I am &s;ome|times inclined to write non&s;en&s;e, as well as the Coun|te&s;s.</P>
<P>I MUST tell you, however, in plain language, that you are beginning to grow amiable again: you are a little of the braggadocio neverthele&s;s; but at your age it is pardonable: and then if at a hundred leagues di&s;tance one were bound to take notice of every

I do not know how you have pa&s;&s;ed your carnival; but as to me, I am &s;ober enough to edify the whole town; and lucky it is that I am; for the &s;i&s;ter-in-law of a very regular canon, who bears no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the capital, is obliged, under pain of public and private &s;candal, to be very regular al&s;o.</P>

At this moment &s;he is put|ting out her little mouth, and trying to ki&s;s us, after having received from papa a tap upon her fingers, which were overturning every thing upon the table. She repeats your name, and &s;ometimes de&s;ires to &s;ee what you have written about her.

<P>I SEND you this time &s;ome papers for <HI>M. Le Mon|nier, painter, at the Little St. Anthony, Rue du Roi de Sicile.</HI> I have been thinking, if you were not de&s;irous of knowing a man, with whom we are connected by the ties of friend&s;hip, you would at lea&s;t be plea&s;ed to &s;ee an e&s;timable arti&s;t, of mild and agreeable man|ners, lately returned from Italy, where he made a long &s;tay.

Yes, I &s;till believe that a per|&s;on who has lately &s;een us, and with whom we are in habits of intimacy, is for that &s;ole rea&s;on not alto|gether unintere&s;ting to you. Eudora improves in &s;trength much more than in learning and di&s;cretion: &s;he is very lively, and very giddy, although brought up alone.

You made me weep with your &s;tories, after having made me laugh with the grave &s;uper&s;cription of your letter. Eudora was much plea&s;ed to hear that you had written to her. In &s;hort, I read her the letter; and when &s;he heard the name of mother, and the recommendation to ki&s;s, &s;he &s;aid with a laugh, 'Why, that's for me now.' You have no need of a pardon, I a&s;&s;ure you, on account of the matter that makes you a&s;k it. Do you think I &s;tand in need of prote&s;tations and a&s;&s;urances to things of that &s;ort?

If I had ever any thing to forgive you, it would have been the unfortunate idea, of which the traces are not yet effaced; but my attachment left genero&s;ity nothing to do: it enabled me to form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the errors of yours, in which I could &s;ee nothing but marks of its &s;trength, and perhaps I love you better than if you had not done me the wrong of a&s;cribing one to me that I do not feel my&s;elf guilty of.

<P>YOU a&s;k me what I am about, and do not &s;uppo&s;e I have the &s;ame occupations as at Amiens: it is true I have le&s;s lei&s;ure to devote to them, or to intermingle them with agreeable &s;tudies. Hou&s;e-keeping is now my principal employ, and the trouble it gives me is of no &s;mall account. My brother was de&s;irous of my taking charge of the hou&s;e, which his mother for many years had cea&s;ed to &s;uperintend, and which he was tired of directing, or of leaving to the care of the &s;ervants.&mdash;This is the way in which I pa&s;s my time. On ri&s;ing, I bu&s;y my&s;elf about my child and my hu&s;|band. I make the former read and get breafa&s;t for them both, and then I leave them together in the &s;tudy; or if the father be ab&s;ent, the little girl re|mains
<PB N="142" REF="034483_0706_0FFDEF7B2AD79720">
with the maid, while I go and inquire into the hou&s;ehold affairs, from the cellar to the garret: the fruit, the wine, the linen, and other details, contri|bute each their part to my &s;tock of daily cares. If I have any time left (ob&s;erve, we dine at noon, and are obliged to be then in decent dre&s;s, becau&s;e there is a chance of our having company, which the old lady is fond of inviting), I pa&s;s it in the &s;tudy, in the labours which I have been accu&s;tomed to &s;hare with my hu&s;|band. After dinner we &s;tay a little while together, and I remain pretty con&s;tantly with my mother-in-law till company comes. I am then at liberty, and go up &s;tairs to the &s;tudy in order to begin, or to continue to write; but when the evening comes, our good brother joins us, and we read the new&s;paper, or &s;omething better. Male vi&s;itors &s;ometimes come up. If I am not the reader, I &s;it down mode&s;tly to my needlework, and li&s;ten, taking care to prevent the child from inter|rupting; for &s;he never leaves us, unle&s;s on occa&s;ion of &s;ome formal repa&s;t. As I do not wi&s;h her to be trouble&s;ome to any one, or take up the attention of the company, &s;he then &s;tays in her own room, or goes to take a walk with her maid, and does not make her appearance till the end of the de&s;&s;ert. I never pay vi&s;its unle&s;s they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. I go out &s;ometimes, though yet it has been but &s;eldom, to take a walk with my good man and Eudora. Bating tho&s;e little differences, every day &s;ees me go over the &s;ame ground, and turn in the &s;ame circle. The

They are talents and in|clinations which lie hidden under the a&s;hes, but which I &s;hall know where to find in order to in&s;til them into my Eudora in proportion as &s;he grows up. Order and peace in every thing that &s;urrounds me, in the matters entru&s;ted to me, and among the per&s;ons with whom I am connected, added to the intere&s;t of my child, of which, amid my various cares, I never lo&s;e &s;ight; the&s;e con&s;titute my bu&s;ine&s;s, and my plea|&s;ure. This kind of life would be very au&s;tere, were not my hu&s;band a man of great merit, whom I love with all my heart; but, with this <HI>datum,</HI> it is mo&s;t delightful. Tender friend&s;hip, and unbounded confi|dence, mark every in&s;tant of it, keep an account of every thing, and &s;tamp a value upon every thing, which nothing without them would have.

I am out of &s;pirits, however &mdash;my Eudora is not very well: her cold indeed does not increa&s;e; but her cough re&s;embles the one that is the forerunner of the mea&s;les: &s;he is a little drow&s;y, and la&s;t night appeared to me to have a fever. To-day I am to take advice. Her father is no better; his cough is no longer relieved by expectoration; and he feels him&s;elf &s;tuffed up, and ill at his ea&s;e.

You cannot figure to your&s;elf my regret at &s;eeing &s;o tender a little being forced already to &s;ubmit to di&s;gu&s;ting and racking remedies. It would &s;eem that medicine ought only to be calculated to relieve the infirmities of age, or the violent di&s;or|ders which our phy&s;ical and moral exce&s;&s;es produce. But that amiable infancy &s;hould &s;tand in need of a fal|lacious art, is a perver&s;ion of all order, and a real &s;ubject of lamentation. Happy tho&s;e who in &s;uch circum&s;tances can find motives of confidence in a man of abilities! There is not here a &s;ingle phy&s;ician on whom I can venture to depend. I have however &s;ent for one; and have got into a fine quarrel with a|nother. We are &s;o alarmed for what we love, that we are always &s;eeking for opinions, without daring to follow our own.&mdash;But let us return to the acade|mies, of which you have &s;ent us &s;uch entertaining accounts.

<P>THE weather is at la&s;t grown milder; but I do not recover my &s;trength; and if it were not for the activity of my mind, I &s;hould bear a great re&s;em|blance to the &s;ilk-worms, when they are about to &s;pin their cocoons, and drag them&s;elves languidly along. I cannot di&s;cover that I have any particu|lar ailment, but always feel as if I were much fa|tigued; and notwith&s;tanding my endeavours to pre|&s;erve a &s;prightly appearance, la&s;&s;itude announces it&s;elf by drawing a hollow circle round my eyes.

I am alarmed, without well knowing why. We have really and truly the &s;mall-pox in our horrible hou&s;e, where we are obliged to have two lodgers, becau&s;e we are not able to fill it our&s;elves, although our fa|mily is tolerably large. We are here a hundred years behind Paris in building and fitting up our hou&s;es, at lea&s;t as far as relates to the laying out of apartments, and &s;till more in the little matters of ornament: it would &s;eem that we are quite as far behind Lyons, al|though we are only at the di&s;tance of five leagues. True it is, that owing to local circum&s;tances, wood, and all other carpenter's materials, are very dear in this little town, where the principal luxury is that of the table. At the hou&s;e of every little citizen, who is at all above the common, more &s;umptuous repa&s;ts are given than in the riche&s;t hou&s;es at Amiens, and even than in many very &s;ub&s;tantial ones at Paris.</P>
<P>UNCOMFORTABLE hou&s;es, a luxurious table, ele|gant dre&s;&s;es, and continual play, &s;ometimes for large &s;ums; &s;uch are the principal features of a town where all the hou&s;es are flat-roofed, and where the &s;mall &s;treets &s;erve as drains for the privies. On the other hand, the inhabitants are by no means &s;tupid: they &s;peak pretty well, without any provincial accent, and even without u&s;ing incorrect expre&s;&s;ions. Their man|ners are al&s;o genteel and agreeable: but they are a little, that is to &s;ay, <HI>very deficient,</HI> in information. Our coun&s;ellors are looked upon as very important per&s;onages; our advocates are as proud as tho&s;e of

Paris, and the attornies are as great rogues here as every where el&s;e. In another re&s;pect, it is quite the rever&s;e of Amiens: there the women are ge|nerally &s;uperior to the men; at Villefranche they are the contrary, and in the women it is that the ru&s;t of the country is the mo&s;t perceptible.</P>

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received accounts of the male part of our family, by one of the vine-dre&s;&s;ers, who brings us every Thur&s;day a provi&s;ion of butter, eggs, vege|tables, &amp;c. Are not the&s;e pretty things to put in a letter? but they are of great u&s;e in a family; they recall rural occupations to our minds, and in that point of view are very agreeable. My poor turtle|dove is quite frozen with the cold winds that prevail; I &s;hall not &s;ee him, however, in a hurry; for his bro|ther is to return on Saturday to confe&s;s the nuns, and he mu&s;t &s;tay behind to &s;uperintend the operations of the cellar. All our &s;ervants are gone down, or rather, up there; there is nothing but <HI>caps</HI> in the hou&s;e, and only think of my &s;implicity! I have not &s;ent for a &s;ingle <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u</HI> to divert me. It is not becau&s;e there is any want of beaux in town; but they are not tempting. The young men of this place are not agreeable; and it is no wonder; for the women do not under&s;tand their bu&s;ine&s;s. Travels, and ob&s;erva|tion, are nece&s;&s;ary to give them a poli&s;h; and accord|ingly they return home more amiable men; while the women remain in their corner, with their little airs and graces, by which nobody is impo&s;ed upon.</P>

<P>I LONG ago perceived the flackne&s;s of my corre&s;pon|dence, and been de&s;irous of an opportunity of making amends, by writing with the lei&s;ure &s;o dear to &s;en&s;ibility. Hou&s;ehold affairs, and occupations in the &s;tudy, have &s;o taken up my time, that my little excur&s;ion was de|layed by them, notwith&s;tanding the &s;peed with which I ha&s;tened to bring them to a conclu&s;ion.

<P>WE have taken up our abode in an apartment which my good friend hired for him&s;elf, and with which the whole of our little family can make &s;hift upon occa&s;ion.

We are in a hand&s;ome hou&s;e, and in a good quarter of the town, quite clo&s;e to the hotel of the Intendant <HI>(l'Intendance),</HI> though very far from our acquaintance; but the mo&s;t di&s;tant of them lends us

I went ye&s;terday to &s;ee Mademoi&s;elle St. Huberti in Dido, her favourite part, which I had never &s;een her play at Paris: I thought her &s;ublime. Our friend has a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s on his hands: a compliment to the academy as an a&s;&s;ociate; another &s;itting at the agricultural &s;ociety, to which he al&s;o be|longs; profe&s;&s;ional ca&s;es; and information to be ob|tained for the continuation of his labours in the Ency|clopedia. If he were to &s;tay here three months, he would find &s;ufficient employment; and I could &s;tay as long without being tired of the place. I have taken a ma&s;ter for the forte-piano, and &s;tudy mu&s;ic every morning, but little, it is true; for vi&s;its, din|ners, &amp;c. engro&s;s a great part of my time. The other day I met <HI>M.

<P>I AM going, Sir, to begin my day with you, by order of my lord and ma&s;ter, who gave me your letter the moment I awoke. It is ten o'clock however; but I bathed at &s;even, went to bed again, and enjoyed that &s;ound and refre&s;hing &s;leep, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to health. I was ye&s;terday at a ball given by one of our lodgers, and danced two cotillons. Take notice, that it was the fir&s;t time I had danced &s;ince two years before my marriage. I found that a reli&s;h for that agreeable exerci&s;e is not &s;o &s;peedily lo&s;t; and notwith|&s;tanding my matron-like age of one-and-thirty, I was rather induced to withdraw at midnight by prudence, than by &s;atiety.</P>
<P>I DO not know what to make of the &s;tory you tell me of your man of a &s;uperior kind: do I know him, or do I not? It appears to me hardly po&s;&s;ible to receive his homage at my feet on the fir&s;t interview, if I have not beforehand &s;ome notion of what he is. In good truth, you have no pity for a poor ru&s;tic, who&s;e imagination naturally grows cold under the influence of every thing around her.

I do not mean that our country ladies are more &s;crupulous than tho&s;e of your great town; but for my part, I think our country gentlemen &s;tupid; and if I had not been already virtuous from habit and principle, I &s;hould have been made &s;o by di&s;|gu&s;t, or the want of knowing how to better my|&s;elf. In &s;ober &s;adne&s;s, there is nothing here to make it worth while to lo&s;e the honour of the field. Accordingly my habits are formed, and your wonderful man will not make me change them: &s;o much the wor&s;e for him, if he is not &s;atis|fied. But if he be a traveller, by the diligence, the notice you have given us will be altogether u&s;ele&s;s: that carriage does not &s;top on the road; if otherwi&s;e, I expect to &s;ee &s;ome good &s;ort of a man in your own way.</P>

I con&s;ole my&s;elf, however, for the non-ar|rival of the gallant you have found out for me, &s;ince I have been informed that he is only fifteen: he would want tutoring, and I am not old enough to under|take his education, or to &s;eek my fortune among &s;chool-boys.

<P>THE po&s;t does not &s;et off till the day after to-mor|row; but I have a few moments of lei&s;ure, and ha&s;ten to tell you, that you have not the merit of being the fir&s;t per&s;on from whom I heard of La Blancherie. I had already been told, that he was at Lyons, and from that moment made no doubt but he was the man of whom you meaned to &s;peak. I am, however, very glad to find that you did not mention Mademoi|&s;elle Phlipon to him. His negligence appears to me the more excu&s;able. <HI>How very mode&s;t I am!</HI> But what I have to tell you is, that La Blancherie having waited upon M. de Villers, the director of the academy of Lyons, in order to reque&s;t he would take him to a fitting, that gentleman a&s;ked him, out of attention and politene&s;s, whether he &s;hould like to become a member. '<HI>No,</HI>' &s;aid La Blancherie, '<HI>I ought not to
<PB N="169" REF="034483_0733_0FFDEFBA6AC762B0">
belong to any academy.</HI>'&mdash;'And why &s;o, pray?'&mdash;'<HI>Be|cau&s;e, if I did, I &s;hould be obliged to belong to all the aca|demies in Europe.</HI>' The grave M. de Villers, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of both energy and &s;pirit, contented him&s;elf with replying, 'You told me, Sir, that you were to dine with M. &mdash;: you may beg him to conduct you to the academy al&s;o.'&mdash;At a &s;itting of ours, I met two or three men of merit from Lyons, who all agreed in &s;aying, that La Blancherie is a mo&s;t un&s;uf|ferable coxcomb. Between our&s;elves, I was not much &s;urpri&s;ed at hearing it; for ten years ago he &s;eemed to have a turn that way, which &s;o great a length of time employed in intriguing in the world, cannot fail to have wonderfully improved.</P>
<P>LET us return to our academical &s;itting, which was very agreeably filled up, in the opinion of every body pre&s;ent. I give you their te&s;timony, becau&s;e my own might appear &s;u&s;picious to you, in two different points of view. In the fir&s;t place, my good man read a di&s;|cour&s;e that was much applauded, upon <HI>the influence of the cultivation of letters in the provinces, compared with their influence in the capital.</HI> There was a good deal in it concerning the women, which &s;everal pre&s;ent had good rea&s;on to apply to them&s;elves, and they would tear my eyes out, perhaps, if they imagined I had any &s;hare in the production.</P>
<P>THE director entertained us with an account of the di&s;coveries of the pre&s;ent age; and a &s;tranger very agreeably explained his opinion, that plants are not
<PB N="170" REF="034483_0734_0FFDEFBD216174B8">
de&s;titute of &s;entiment. This author is a Swi&s;s, &s;ettled at Lyons, and a prote&s;tant mini&s;ter. He is arrived from England, after taking a doctor's degree at Ox|ford, and is lately married to a young woman of eighteen, who is a native of Sedan, and whom he brought with him. We kept them with us the day after the &s;itting, and became very intimate. A high vicar of Lyons, whom we knew before, read &s;ome pieces of excellent critici&s;m, tran&s;lated from the Ger|man. The &s;ecretary recited an epi&s;tle in very plea|&s;ing poetry, congratulating our friend on his return to his country, accompanied by a helpmate, of whom the poet &s;poke as poets are accu&s;tomed to do. It is pretty certain this did not tend to recommend me to the favour of the women. Not daring, however, to &s;ay any thing again&s;t it, they would fain have it in their power to critici&s;e the di&s;cour&s;e of an academi|cian, who&s;e wife was the &s;ubject of a public panegy|ric. But, unfortunately, although it contains &s;ome &s;evere truths, that regard them, the language is ex|ceedingly polite, and even elegant.</P>
<P>NOW for a word or two of your Me&s;&s;ieurs Ducis and Thomas, who are at Lyons, and who puff each other off like the two a&s;&s;es in the fable. The latter has thought proper to print &s;ome poetry, addre&s;&s;ed to Jeannin, whom you know, and whom every body ri|dicules. In his ver&s;es, the academician prai&s;es the charlatan in the mo&s;t extravagant terms, and to make the matter more moving, has in&s;erted an epi&s;ode
<PB N="171" REF="034483_0735_0FFDEFBFD10A7510">
about Ducis, who in pa&s;&s;ing the mountains of Savoy in an old crazy carriage, was over&s;et, and frighted out of his wits. Thomas &s;ees in his brother academician the Sophocles of France, who&s;e furious hor&s;es are dragging him along like Hyppolitus, and da&s;hing his chariot to pieces. A country gentleman, tir|ed of this learned jargon, and &s;ick of &s;uch ful&s;ome flattery, has an&s;wered him in ver&s;es which I inclo&s;e, &s;incerely regretting that I cannot join in your opinion concerning my countrymen; but if the judges of your Parna&s;&s;es make &s;uch blunders, how will you defend the herd of our <HI>badauds</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pari&s;ians are called <HI>badauds</HI> in deri&s;ion as our Londoners are called cockneys.&mdash;<HI>Tran&s;.</HI></NOTE>? Independently of the bad &s;ub|ject cho&s;en by Thomas, his ver&s;es are not even worthy of a writer of panegyric. The&s;e, however, are the great men who are to &s;hine on Tue&s;day at the public &s;itting at Lyons, where one of them is to read a canto of his Petreide: you will have an account of it from La Blancherie, who is to return immediately. I do not imagine he has met with many &s;ub&s;cribers at Lyons.</P>

occupy our places at table; but what then? We are here in the a&s;ylum of peace and liberty; we no longer hear a &s;colding tongue going from morning to night; nor do we any longer behold a forbidding countenance, in which a want of feeling and jea|lou&s;y are depicted by turns, and in which &s;pite and anger were perceptible through the di&s;gui&s;e of irony, whenever we meet with any &s;ucce&s;s, or receive any marks of attention. We breathe a pure air, and can obey the dictates of friend&s;hip and confidence, with|out fearing to irritate by the manife&s;tation of tho&s;e &s;en|timents, a hard heart, which was never acquainted with them, and which hates to &s;ee them in others.

There remains, for variety, the greater or &s;maller degree of attraction, eagerne&s;s, and plea&s;ure, in cultivating that friend&s;hip: in this re|&s;pect the field is wide and open. You were flame co|lour la&s;t year; you are now of a &s;moky grey; while I, who never run into extremes, pre&s;erve a pretty re|gular hue, and am witne&s;s to your o&s;cillations without con&s;idering them as &s;trange.</P>
<P>TRANQUIL and &s;acred friend&s;hip has a point of &s;up|port on which the balance ever re&s;ts. The pa&s;&s;ions, at once delightful and cruel, tran&s;port us out of our|&s;elves, and at la&s;t de&s;ert us; but &s;incerity of &s;oul, and propriety of conduct, the confidence of a true and feel|ing heart, the moderation of a well-regulated temper, with good and fixed principles; the&s;e are the things that in&s;ure the continuance of a connexion, whatever alteration it may &s;eem to &s;uffer. The&s;e, my worthy friend, a&s;&s;ure you that you will find me ever the &s;ame. No doubt as wife and mother fixed to a point, and
<PB N="177" REF="034483_0742_0FFDEFD028073528">
&s;atisfied with tho&s;e happy titles, it is more ea&s;y for me to pre&s;erve an equability in my intercour&s;e with my friends, than it can be for you, who&s;e un&s;ettled &s;itua|tion mu&s;t occa&s;ion a fluctuation in your affections: accordingly I make a due allowance for effects and cau&s;es, and, at the &s;ame time that I am &s;en&s;ible of your variations, continue to be your friend.</P>
<P>BY the way, I cannot help laughing at my &s;impli|city in making &s;o particular an an&s;wer to a man, who, &s;ince he wrote his letter, has been thinking of &s;o many other things, that he does not, perhaps, even know what I mean.</P>
<P>HOWEVER that may be, I mu&s;t reque&s;t you to do me a piece of &s;ervice with all convenient &s;peed: the matter in que&s;tion is as follows:</P>
<P>A MAN of excellent &s;en&s;e, whom I particularly e&s;teem, has undertaken to deliver a funeral oration on the Duke of Orleans; but does not know very well what to &s;ay, any more than my&s;elf. It therefore be|comes nece&s;&s;ary to collect facts and anecdotes, to come at the public opinion, to know &s;omething, in &s;hort, of the habits of that prince, that may &s;erve to give an idea of his way of life, both in the world, and in his own family&mdash;&s;omething that may be brought forward that will furni&s;h the means of drawing inferences, and admit of embelli&s;hment. Your acquaintance is &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive to enable you to pick up &s;ome ma|terials. Try what you can do, and &s;end me the re|&s;ult: you can ea&s;ily perceive what I want. I know
<PB N="178" REF="034483_0743_0FFDC5CF6AEDC6D0">
your activity is great, and I depend on your friendly exertions.</P>
<P>MY good man is returned to Lyons; whence he is to &s;end me your letter which he took for him&s;elf, and to which he reque&s;ts me to &s;ay in an&s;wer, <HI>that he does not dread any one's reading what he writes to his friends; that he well knows people of great &s;en&s;ibility are &s;u&s;picious, uncompliant, and &s;ometimes even cruel; that at bottom, however, they are well worth other folks; that you are very much of that &s;tamp, as well as him|&s;elf; and it is, no doubt, on that account he loves you.</HI> If by chance he be in the right, and if your letter which I take to be an an&s;wer to mine, prove entirely for him, you will not fail to hear of it in pretty plain terms.</P>

<P>WHAT are we to think, my good friend, of your fate, and of our own? I mean of the changes that ere this have taken place in your department, and of the little ha&s;te you are in to inform us of them, as far as you are per&s;onally concerned. Do you &s;uppo&s;e we no longer feel &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in that re&s;pect, to look upon you as bound to &s;end us &s;uch information? On what can an error &s;o injurious to our friend&s;hip be founded? I cannot, indeed, believe it exi&s;ts. But how are we to account for your &s;ilence? A&s;&s;uredly, after what you have already intimated to us, you mu&s;t

<P>IF any thing unplea&s;ant have re&s;ulted from them, why have you not unbo&s;omed your&s;elf to your friends? If not, as I am more inclined to per&s;uade my&s;elf, how have you had the heart to leave us &s;o long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e?</P>
<P>IN a word, whatever may have happened, and how|ever you may be, write to us, and do not reduce us to the painful nece&s;&s;ity of inquiring into the cau&s;e of a &s;ilence which friend&s;hip cannot brook.</P>
<P>WHEN you have made us ea&s;y on your own account, &s;end us news of what is pa&s;&s;ing in the capital, and of the Cardinal, of whom in the country we no longer know what to think. I mu&s;t once more remind you of the notes concerning the Duke of Orleans who&s;e funeral oration is expected with impatience, while the author, in his turn, impatiently expects the informa|tion you are to &s;end.</P>
<P>EUDORA grows tolerably fa&s;t, and begins to read: her father is at this moment very much engaged. We all embrace you, and earne&s;tly beg you will &s;end us accounts of your &s;ituation, of your&s;elf, of your&s;elf again, and of your&s;elf above every thing.

<P>BECAUSE upon a &s;tranger's account I went into &s;o|ciety, where any one might have &s;een that I made as good a figure as my neighbours, and have judged that I mu&s;t be very fond of home to remain there alone, while qualified upon occa&s;ion to receive company, and to do the honours of my hou&s;e, Mr. Philo&s;opher mu&s;t needs take upon him to decide, that I have determined to live like other country ladies, always from home, and for ever at the card-table.</P>
<P>BECAUSE I am a&s;toni&s;hed that the child of a man of feeling, and of a good-natured woman, &s;hould be of &s;o ob&s;tinate a temper as only to be overcome by har&s;h mea&s;ures, and becau&s;e I regret the &s;everity I am obliged to a&s;&s;ume in order to make her bend beneath the yoke of nece&s;&s;ity, this wonderful rea&s;oner imme|diately concludes that I have caught the contagion, and that my daughter will &s;oon have an iron collar round her neck, and a clog to her leg.

in judging of the di&s;po&s;ition, inclinations, talents, and preten&s;ions of every individual; of the relation of each to all the re&s;t, and of one to another; of their plans, duties, and pa&s;&s;ions; of the public and private opera|tions of the latter; of their influence upon important mea&s;ures, and upon actions the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant; of the re&s;ult of all the&s;e things in regard to general manners, and tho&s;e of private families, &amp;c.

From thence I &s;hould have carried you to the country, in company with an Italian lady, full of fire, wit, graces, and talents, and joining to all the&s;e good qualities, a &s;ound judgment, a con&s;iderable portion of knowledge, and an excellent heart; with a German lady, gentle by nature, rendered grave by a republican education, &s;imple in her manners, and combining great good nature with very uncommon information; and with a man of a re&s;erved di&s;po&s;ition, but good tempered, witty, and polite.

<P>IN the next place, you mu&s;t know that Eudora reads well; begins to leave off all playthings but the needle; amu&s;es her&s;elf in making geometrical figures; is entirely unfettered by dre&s;s; has no idea of the value &s;et upon &s;craps of gauze and ends of ribbons; thinks her&s;elf fine when &s;he is told that &s;he is good, and has a clean white frock on; and looks upon a cake, given with a ki&s;s, as the greate&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible rewards. You mu&s;t know too, that her fits of ill humour are more unfrequent, and of &s;horter duration; that &s;he walks in the dark as well as by day|light, is afraid of nothing, and does not think it worth while to tell a lie on any occa&s;ion whatever. Add to this, that &s;he is five years and &s;ix weeks old; that I do not perceive that &s;he has fal&s;e ideas on any &s;ubject, of importance at lea&s;t; and you will allow, that if her ob|&s;tinacy has fatigued me, if her fancies have made me unea&s;y, and if her carele&s;s indifference has rendered it more difficult for us to keep her under, our pains, neverthele&s;s, have not been thrown away.</P>
<P>UPON &s;umming up every thing, I found by your letter that all the rea&s;oning, of which you were your|&s;elf the direct object, was very ju&s;t; that you under|&s;tood very well what was conducive to your pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s; and that, con&s;equently, you were a better philo&s;opher than three-fourths of man|kind.

<P>YOUR fervent prayers have recalled me from the abode of &s;hadows, and I can once more conver&s;e with the living. I did not lo&s;e &s;ight of you in the other world; but I &s;aw you only in the di&s;tance, like tho&s;e fleeting clouds which appear upon, and are hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable from the horizon. Your ori&s;ons, and your efforts to attract attention, brought me back to you worldly folks with additional experience. When I had inhabited only one planet, I thought it was po&s;&s;i|ble to cultivate the acquaintance of its inhabitants, without injury to our intercour&s;e with the men of an|other. But I plainly perceive that it is not the ca&s;e; and that Pro&s;erpine was in the right to divide the year alternately between Pluto and Ceres. As long as I remained in the &s;tudy, nailed down to my de&s;k, you heard from me often, and could judge of my way of life, and perhaps of my heart, by my corre&s;pondence; but as long as that corre&s;pondence was kept up with &s;pirit, the people in our neighbourhood, and of our

town, looked upon me as a hermit, who could only conver&s;e with the dead, and who di&s;dained all com|merce with her fellow-creatures. I laid down my pen; &s;u&s;pended my literary labours; walked forth from my mu&s;eum, mixed in the world, and &s;uffered it to approach me; talked, ate, danced, and laughed, like other people, with every body that came in my way; and then my neighbours perceived that I was neither an owl, nor a con&s;tellation, nor a female pe|dant; but a being both tolerable and tolerant; while you, on the other hand, thought me dead. I am about to re&s;ume my &s;tudies, to return to my &s;olitude, and expect to hear you alter your note once more.</P>
<P>WHAT have <HI>you</HI> been doing all the while? You have, no doubt, increa&s;ed the &s;um of your knowledge; but have you augmented your &s;trength of mind, &s;o as to take mankind as you find them, the world as it goes, and fortune in whatever &s;hape &s;he may pre&s;ent her&s;elf? As to me, I am in &s;uch a &s;tate as no longer to care about any thing that may contribute to that end. This you will &s;ay is ea&s;y for a per&s;on who&s;e ne&s;t is feathered; and who has a mate to help her to phi|lo&s;ophize, and the re&s;t of it; but there are a number of circum&s;tances and things which are independent of all this, and which have an influence over our happi|ne&s;s: that influence it is that my rea&s;on turns to good, or reduces to a cipher.</P>

<P>WHAT is come to you then, my good old friend? We hear no more about you; we only receive a few &s;hort lines announcing &s;ome inclo&s;ure, or giving us an account of &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion you have been good enough to undertake; but not a &s;ingle word of friend&s;hip: not one of tho&s;e little articles of chit|chat, which are &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of it, becau&s;e they proceed from the fulne&s;s of the heart, and are given with a confidence of their proving intere&s;ting. Do you no longer love us? Have you met with better friends, with per&s;ons who value you more highly, who cheri&s;h you more, or are more de&s;irous of cultivating with you an agreeable and la&s;ting connexion, founded upon reciprocal e&s;teem, and &s;imilarity of ta&s;te and in|clinations?</P>
<P>I SHALL not envy you the happine&s;s of having met with beings of more analogous minds, who enable you to enjoy the plea&s;ure that re&s;ults from the com|munication of your thoughts and &s;entiments; but I &s;hall complain of your &s;eeming to forget tho&s;e with whom you formerly partook of that &s;atisfaction. I know that I have for &s;ome time pa&s;t written le&s;s frequently than before; but I have told you the rea&s;on. You ought to have pitied us on account of the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, and variety of cares, that prevented us from contributing as much as u&s;ual to the commerce of friend&s;hip, and not to
<PB N="198" REF="034483_0764_0FFDEFFFF93CC948">
have written the le&s;s on that account your&s;elf; but the contrary.</P>
<P>IT is by mutually &s;upplying each other's deficiencies, according to circum&s;tances, that we keep up the &s;acred flame of friend&s;hip, of which candour, &s;implicity, unbounded affection, and indulgence, are the nece&s;&s;ary attributes. To proceed therefore according to my principles, I forgive you whatever I may have rea&s;on to complain of, and I dedicate to you the fir&s;t moments, not of lei&s;ure, but of liberty, which I can find in the mid&s;t of the more peaceful, though very bu&s;y life to which I am returned.</P>
<P>WE have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed three weeks at Lyons, when the nece&s;&s;ity of cultivating a variety of acquaintance and connexions, and of fulfilling the engagements they led us to contract, did not leave me a moment to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>LET us know then what your feelings are: take a &s;olitary walk; you u&s;ed to tell me, that it was in &s;oli|tude that you became &s;en&s;ible that you had friends, and a heart; I hope that in &s;uch moments we are not for|gotten. &mdash;Is the revolution in public affairs likely to produce any in your department? Can you devi&s;e any project for your more rapid promotion? Or do you continue to con&s;ole your&s;elf for the contrary by the plea&s;ures of &s;tudy? They are certainly great for a phi|lo&s;ophic mind.

Perhaps I &s;hould have an&s;wered it &s;ooner, if I had had more time; bu&s;ine&s;s on the one hand, cares on the other, and company into the bargain, are more than enough to fill up the day, and to take away the de&s;ire, or the power, of entering into chat with our di&s;tant friends: be&s;ides&mdash;but we will &s;ay no more on that &s;ubject.</P>

<P>REALLY and truly, my good friend, I have been thinking of applying to a third per&s;on, in order to learn what is become of you: it is &s;o long &s;ince we have had any accounts from you, expre&s;&s;ed in the tone of confidence, which keeps up that of one's friends, that I almo&s;t doubt whether my corre&s;pon|dence upon the old footing will be well received.</P>
<P>HAVE we not a new acquaintance to make? Or do you, who formerly wrote me word that you changed every year, re&s;emble the <HI>you</HI> of three years ago? It is highly nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould let me know; for however long we may &s;uppo&s;e the tele&s;cope to be, mine does not enable me to &s;ee things a hundred leagues off. I can only judge by approximation. For in&s;tance, I recollect to have known you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a true and af|fectionate heart; and as that is a thing which does not ea&s;ily change its nature, I &s;uppo&s;e you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it &s;till, and love you accordingly. But it &s;eems to me al&s;o, that you are &s;ometimes in your mode of expre&s;|&s;ion, and in your &s;tyle, the rever&s;e of good-nature, or thereabouts; it &s;eems to me al&s;o, that you do not like
<PB N="203" REF="034483_0769_0FFDF017F6405DE0">
to be told of it; but then I recollect that I have paid you in your coin, when your ill-temper has made me lo&s;e mine, and I a&s;k my&s;elf in what &s;tate things are at pre&s;ent? Is the tinge grown deeper, or is it gone off? I am for the latter &s;ide of the que&s;tion, when I figure to my&s;elf the effects of &s;tudy, of meditation, and of happy inclinations; but I am for the former when I con&s;ider the influence of the world, the &s;ociety of fools, the &s;en&s;e of injustice, and the hatred of prejudices, and of tyranny. I &s;hall therefore continue in this &s;tate of incertitude, until you remove my doubts. But that you may have none in regard to me, I will give you my barometer, as it &s;tands in the different places I inhabit. In the country, I forgive every thing: whenever you know me to be there, you may ven|ture to &s;hew your&s;elf, &s;uch as you are, at the mo|ment of writing: an original, a cen&s;or, or, if needs mu&s;t, moro&s;e: my &s;tock of indulgence is inexhau&s;t|ible, and my friend&s;hip tolerates all kinds of ap|pearances, and every &s;ort of tone. At <HI>Lyons</HI> I make a je&s;t of every thing; the company I &s;ee there puts me in good humour, my imagination grows more lively, and if you rou&s;e it, you mu&s;t take the con|&s;equences; it will not let a joke e&s;cape, without &s;ending it back with a &s;harper point. At Ville|franche I deliberate upon every thing, and &s;ome|times am a cen&s;or in my turn.

Amid&s;t all this I do not forget your di&s;&s;ertations, which are not at all in my favour: they take up a great deal of your time, damp your imagination, and do not leave room for the lea&s;t word of friend&s;hip.

By way of reviving it, I will &s;peak to you of my daughter, whom you are plea&s;ed with, be|cau&s;e &s;he puts me out of all patience. In the fir&s;t place, &s;he has &s;till that claim to your kindne&s;s, although &s;he gives me hopes that it will not always be the &s;ame; &s;he begins to fear reproaches almo&s;t as much as doing penance upon dry bread; &s;he is, perhaps, more &s;en&s;ible of the approbation be&s;towed upon her when &s;he behaves well, than of the plea&s;ure of eating a bit of &s;ugar; and is fonder of being car|re&s;&s;ed, than of playing with her doll.

She has a &s;trong inclination to &s;ay and do the very contrary of what &s;he is de&s;ired, becau&s;e &s;he thinks it agreeable to act in her own way; and this &s;ometimes carries her to great lengths. But as &s;he is &s;ure to be repaid with in|tere&s;t, &s;he begins to &s;u&s;pect that &s;he might do better, and gives her&s;elf as much credit for an act of obedi|ence,

You will find in the box that accompanies this, &s;everal indivi|duals of a &s;pecies of in&s;ect which preys upon arti|chokes. The&s;e villainous little animals, of a &s;hape &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of caterpillars, have at the end of their tails a kind of &s;caly mantle, which they throw over their backs, and thus brave every danger. When once they &s;et to work upon the arti|chokes, they devour the pulpy &s;ub&s;tance of the leaves; the whole plant turns white, and withers; cea&s;es to be productive; and &s;ometimes ab&s;olutely dies. We are ignorant, in this country, both of the name of the in&s;ect, and of the way of de&s;troying it. They do not often make their appearance; and, if I may judge from the pre&s;ent year, the fir&s;t in which they have been &s;een &s;ince I came to this part of the world, they never &s;how them&s;elves but after a great drought.</P>
<P>IF it be unknown to you, it is a pre&s;ent I am making you, and I a&s;k in return a receipt to get rid of them: if you can procure us one, you will render a &s;ervice

<P>HONOUR to the &s;ciences, and &s;till more to men of &s;cience, for their admirable expedients! Are not my artichokes well protected? And have I not made a notable addition to the &s;um of my knowledge, by learning to give the name of <HI>larva,</HI> to what I de&s;igna|ted &s;o well, by that of the little black animal?</P>

they fall directly upon the artichoke it&s;elf, and pay no further attention to the leaves of the plant. You and your brother mu&s;t agree as you can about the two bottles of oil: in the mean time I mu&s;t inform your &s;cience, that it is for the u&s;e of the human &s;pecies alone, and that it is the la&s;t and more powerful remedy for worms. The do&s;e is a few drops, in a &s;poonful of any &s;ort of &s;yrup. By the&s;e means grown-up per&s;ons have been &s;natched from the grave, after all other remedies have proved ineffectual, and when they have been almo&s;t expiring in convul&s;ions. Eudora once took &s;ome in a violent fit of &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;hortly after voided a very large worm, the only one which &s;he ever brought away in her life, and of which the expul&s;ion was the &s;ignal of better health.</P>

<P>I EXPECT your &s;evere critique; but I beg you to &s;u&s;pend it as far as relates to the article Lavater, as I have new matter to furni&s;h.</P>
<P>YOU no longer &s;ay any thing about your men of &s;cience, and the intriguers, and &s;o on, that pretend to it: what is that little nation doing, while the great republic is in di&s;order, and money as &s;carce in the cof|fers of the &s;tate, as water was in our ci&s;tern in the months of April and May?</P>

<P>IT is not to the citizen only that I addre&s;s my&s;elf to-day, but to the naturali&s;t al&s;o. We do not give up politics: they are at this moment too intere&s;ting; nor &s;hould we de&s;erve to live in a free country, if we grew indifferent to the public weal. But the days are long; people of a lively imagination, and ardent minds, &s;oon draw their conclu&s;ions; letters and con|ver&s;ation can only fill up a part of our time, when we are not actors in the bu&s;y &s;cene our&s;elves; nor can we for ever fea&s;t upon the &s;ame di&s;h. Furs are then coming once more upon the carpet: they are intere&s;t|ing on account of their immediate relation to a part of natural hi&s;tory. There is no work indeed in which
<PB N="221" REF="034483_0787_0FFDF043E5038660">
we cannot, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, introduce and &s;et forth the rights of ju&s;tice, and the true principles of admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>WE are &s;tudying with much plea&s;ure the <HI>Mamma|lia</HI> of <HI>Erxleben,</HI> and I think we may quote him with confidence: we have, however, remarked, that his own quotations of the different works of Linnaeus, Buffon, Bomare him&s;elf, and a thou&s;and other authors, are from editions more than twenty years old.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t natural hi&s;tory has been very generally cultivated: it has made a great pro|gre&s;s, and we &s;hould perhaps run a ri&s;k of finding our|&s;elves behindhand in &s;everal articles, if we were to place our principal dependence upon an authority of &s;uch ancient date.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould be glad to know then whether any able naturali&s;t exi&s;t in Europe, who has publi&s;hed &s;ince that period; and whether you chance to be acquainted with any work of later date, which is worth con&s;ulting, and de&s;erving of faith. Communicate to us what you know in that re&s;pect, and try to procure us all the in|formation you can. Did Erxleben publi&s;h nothing but his <HI>Mammalia,</HI> particularly &s;ince he gave that work to the world? And have not &s;ome of the learned men of Germany, or England, gone over the &s;ame ground &s;ince with equal &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as you have it in your power, we &s;hall ex|pect a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer on that head, and in the mean time will beg you to explain to us one of his

<P>YOU de&s;erve a few friendly lines for your la&s;t let|ter, which gave us great plea&s;ure. I can ea&s;ily con|ceive how much you mu&s;t be occupied; and accord|ingly I do not complain of your momentary &s;ilence, as of a fault which you commit, but as of a privation which I &s;uffer. Courage then; continue to a&s;&s;emble: by dint of uniting for the common weal, the &s;phere of good-will is extended, ideas are propagated, and the public &s;pirit is fixed upon a firmer footing.</P>
<P>OUR &s;illy country towns are a hundred leagues be|hind you in all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pects: vanity there is &s;o great, that each individual thinks he has grown one half &s;maller.

right, and that we mu&s;t have a &s;mall touch of civil war before we are good for any thing. All the&s;e little quarrels, and in&s;urrections of the people, &s;eem to me inevitable; nor do I think it po&s;&s;ible to ri&s;e to liberty, from the mid&s;t of corruption, without &s;trong convul|&s;ions. They are the &s;alutary cri&s;is of a &s;erious di&s;|ea&s;e. We are in want of a terrible political fever to carry off our foul humours. Go on and pro&s;per then let our rights be declared; let them be &s;ubmitted to our con&s;ideration; and let the con&s;titution come af|terwards.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall come to blows: I fully expect it: what is to be done? We mu&s;t arm our&s;elves with courage. I will lay a&s;ide the &s;ciences, and all the re&s;t of it, to talk and think of nothing but politics. At this mo|ment can any other intere&s;t come in competition with our political concerns? But it becomes us to keep in our proper places, and not to rebel again&s;t the in|fluence of tho&s;e about us.</P>

<P>A TRUCE for a moment with your politics: let us return to natural hi&s;tory, to the &s;tudy of which
<PB N="227" REF="034483_0793_0FFDF1638E8339A8">
the country invites, But our ideas concerning it have been &s;o di&s;turbed, that we are puzzled to find our way even with the help of Erxleben.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance, I think I have formed a ju&s;t concep|tion of Linnaeus's divi&s;ions, of which the <HI>cla&s;&s;es</HI> are the fir&s;t; the <HI>orders,</HI> &s;ubdivi&s;ions of cla&s;&s;es; the <HI>gene|ra,</HI> &s;ubdivi&s;ions of orders; the <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> &s;ubdivi&s;ions of genera; and the <HI>varieties,</HI> &s;ubdivi&s;ions of &s;pecies. It appears to me that Erxleben ranges his divi&s;ions in the &s;ame way: however, when I look for examples, I think I perceive contradictions. His Mammalia con|&s;i&s;t of only one cla&s;s, in which he has included 51 orders. The fir&s;t of tho&s;e orders, <HI>homo,</HI> has only varieties; but in the fourth order, <HI>cere&s;pithecus,</HI> I con|&s;ider as genera the <HI>hamadryas,</HI> the <HI>veter,</HI> the <HI>&s;enex,</HI> the <HI>vetulus,</HI> the <HI>&s;ilenus,</HI> the <HI>faunus,</HI> &amp;c. How happens it then that he &s;ays, after the &s;ynonimy of <HI>faunus, barba|tus, cauda apice fiocco&s;a</HI> SPECIES <HI>ob&s;cura adeoque dubia?</HI></P>
<P>THIS word <HI>&s;pecies</HI> deranges all my ideas, and I can no longer under&s;tand the author's arrange|ment.</P>
<P>I SHOULD like to find in his <HI>Mammalia</HI> an example to ju&s;tify his &s;tatement of the &s;ubdivi&s;ions: I &s;hould wi&s;h to find in one of the 51 orders a genus having both <HI>&s;pecies</HI> and varieties belonging to it, or to know why the denomination <HI>&s;pecies</HI> is applied to a divi&s;ion which I had rea&s;on to con&s;ider as a genus.</P>
<P>GIVE me the clue of this labyrinth, in which I am lo&s;t, and out of which I can no longer find my way.</P>

<P>I COULD ea&s;ily in this place forget public affairs, and the di&s;putes of mankind: contented with the range of the manor, with &s;eeing my hens hatch their young, and with tending my rabbits, I no longer think of the revolutions of empires. But, as &s;oon as I am in town, the mi&s;ery of the people, and the in&s;olence of the rich, excite my hatred of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;i|on; and I no longer a&s;k any thing of heaven, but the triumph of truth, and the &s;ucce&s;s of our regeneration.</P>

<P><PB N="235" REF="034483_0801_0FFDF1796E0D2388"><HI>Madam Roland wrote me by almo&s;t every po&s;t from the beginning of the revolution, letters as replete with pa|trioti&s;m as the above; but I only kept tho&s;e which it was not worth while to circulate. Whether they were intended for me or Lanthenas, I &s;ent them to the latter, who u&s;ed to communicate them to Bri&s;&s;ot, and other per&s;ons; and they never came into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again. Many of them &s;erved to make articles in the different journals, particularly, the Patriote Fran&ccedil;ois, and were remarka|ble for their energy, and for the ju&s;t reflections they con|tained.</HI></P>
