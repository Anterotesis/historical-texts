<BIBL>JUDGES, Chap. XX. Ver. 26, 27, 28.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Then all the Children of I&s;rael, and all the People went up, and came unto the Hou&s;e of GOD, and wept, and &s;at there before the Lord, and fa&s;ted that day until even, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace offerings before the Lord. And the Children of I&s;rael enquired of the Lord&mdash;&s;aying, Shall I yet again go out to Battle again&s;t the Chil|dren of</HI> BENJAMIN <HI>my Brother, or &s;hall I cea&s;e? And the Lord &s;aid, go up, for to-morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the Context, we find the men of I&s;rael gathered to|gether, from one end of the land, even to the other, in a general a&s;&s;embly, to &s;ee ju&s;tice done upon the per|petrators of an horrid <HI>rape,</HI> committed upon the Levite's concubine: Which, al&s;o, carried <HI>murder</HI> with it; for &s;he pre&s;ently died of the abu&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER a particular account of this tragical &s;cene, had from the Levite, the party injured,
<PB N="4" REF="015602_0003_0F998D818D3AC3B8">
they &s;end me&s;&s;engers through the tribe of <HI>Benja|min,</HI> to which the profligate wretches, who had done this deed, belonged, to make further en|quity; and demand the criminals to be delivered into their hand, to be puni&s;hed as their crime de|&s;erved, that the guilt thereof might be put away from I&s;rael: But they refu&s;e to deliver them, and prepare for <HI>war.</HI> Upon this the men of I&s;rael con&s;ider the guilt of this horrible wickedne&s;s, as lying on the whole tribe, who had undertaken to &s;kreen the criminals from ju&s;tice; and re&s;olve to avenge it on them, accordingly, by the &s;word. But fir&s;t, they religiou&s;ly con&s;ulted Heaven upon the &s;olemn affair: Not &s;o much indeed, as to the thing, whether they &s;hould go on with their de&s;ign; the rea&s;on and right of this, being even &s;elf-evident, and apparent at fir&s;t view; but rather as to the manner, and circum&s;tantial management of the cau&s;e. "<HI>The children of I&s;rael aro&s;e, and went up to the hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, <HI>and a&s;ked coun&s;el of</HI> GOD, <HI>and &s;aid, which of us &s;hall go up fir&s;t to the battle again&s;t the children of</HI> Benjamin? <HI>And the Lord &s;aid,</HI> Judah <HI>&s;hall go up fir&s;t</HI>" They proceed to battle; <HI>Ben|jamin</HI> prevails that day, and kills twenty-two thou|&s;and of the men of I&s;rael. This &s;eems to have made them &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious of their cau&s;e, whether it was ju&s;t and right in the &s;ight of GOD: However, upon the whole, they are &s;o far &s;atisfi|ed it is &s;o, that they re&s;olve to go on with it, if the Lord does not forbid them; under who&s;e awful hand, they fir&s;t humble them&s;elves, and a&s;k fur|ther coun&s;el of him: "<HI>The men of I&s;rael encoura|ged them&s;elves, and &s;et their battle in array; and went
<PB N="5" REF="015602_0004_0F998D823579E930">
up, and wept before the Lord until even, and a&s;ked coun&s;el of the Lord, &s;aying, &s;hall I go up again to battle again&s;t the children of</HI> Benjamin, <HI>my brother? And the Lord &s;aid, go up again&s;t him.</HI>" They go up, therefore, a &s;econd time; but, &s;till <HI>Benjamin</HI> prevails, and de&s;troys of them eighteen, thou&s;and more. Whereupon, not only the men of war, but all the people that were a&s;&s;embled on this &s;ad occa&s;ion, repair again to the hou&s;e of the Lord, and &s;pend the remainder of the day in re|ligious mourning, fa&s;ting and prayer, and offer|ing &s;acrifices of atonement for &s;in: For they per|ceive, by this time, that the Lord is angry with them. Yet they do not de&s;i&s;t from their enter|prize; but, in this way of humbling them&s;elves under the awful, and repeated rebukes of Hea|ven, and earne&s;t &s;eeking GOD'S reconciled face and favor, they determine &s;till to pro&s;ecute the cau&s;e in hand, and if po&s;&s;ible, to carry it through, if the Lord does not forbid them; who&s;e will, they yet further enquire after, on this occa&s;ion: "<HI>Then all the children of I&s;rael, and all the people went up, and came to the Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, <HI>and wept, &amp;c.</HI>" And in their next encounter with the <HI>Ben|jamites,</HI> their arms had full &s;ucce&s;s. It plea&s;ed GOD to permit <HI>Benjamin</HI> to prevail again&s;t them, in a fir&s;t and &s;econd engagement, becau&s;e there were with them, even with them, great and grie|vous &s;ins again&s;t the Lord their GOD, for which he would puni&s;h them, in this awful way; and yet, in his own time, he appeared for the &s;up|port, and carrying through of the cau&s;e in which they were engaged. An awful &s;cene, truly this
<PB N="6" REF="015602_0005_0F998D82DE46D2F0">
was! And yet, on the &s;ide of I&s;rael, undoubted|ly ju&s;t. Not only a part which they might act without &s;in, but a part which they were in duty bound to act, and could not neglect, without great &s;in, however &s;everely they &s;uffered by it them|&s;elves, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for their other &s;ins. Although there is not a univer&s;al corre&s;pondence of circum&s;tances, yet in many re&s;pects, the hear|er will undoubtedly &s;ee an evident agreement be|tween my &s;ubject, and the &s;ad occa&s;ion of this &s;o|lemnity&mdash;the awful war in which we are engag|ed with <HI>Britain,</HI> and our duty and intere&s;t depend|ing; in reference whereunto, we are profe&s;&s;edly humbling our&s;elves before the Lord, this day, and a&s;king coun&s;el of Heaven.</P>
<P>MY &s;ubject opens a large field before us; time will be wanting to travel it fully over: I &s;hall &s;tu|dy brevity, and, therefore, omit many points that are contained in the text: Neither &s;hall I run the length, with tho&s;e I take under con&s;ideration, which they might naturally lead me. Let me crave your &s;erious attention to the&s;e four things, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That in certain circum&s;tances, it is ju&s;t and right, and agreeable to the will of GOD, for his <HI>own profe&s;&s;ing, covenant people,</HI> to take the &s;word and go to war, even again&s;t their brethren.&mdash;That, in fir&s;t commencing, and after pro&s;ecu|ting a war, e&s;pecially with brethren, there &s;hould be a fair, impartial, often-repeated enquiry into the right of it, that we may act with a &s;afe con&s;cience, and be able to ju&s;tify our proceeding&mdash;That it is nothing &s;trange and new, if, in pro|&s;ecuting
<PB N="7" REF="015602_0006_0F998D8468D61618">
a ju&s;t war, for our &s;ins again&s;t heaven, we meet with &s;evere and repeated rebukes. And therefore, although this calls for mourning, and deep humiliation before the Lord, and a &s;erious concern to obtain pardon and reconciliation with him; yet it is not &s;ufficient ground of di&s;courage|ment from a further pro&s;ecution of the cau&s;e, with hope in the mercy of GOD, to &s;upport and carry it through, in his own, wi&s;e and holy, time and way.</P>
<P>PROPOSITION I. IN certain circum&s;tan|ces, it is ju&s;t and right, and agreeable to the will of GOD, for his own profe&s;&s;ing covenant people, to take the &s;word, and go to war, even again&s;t their brethren: Shall I go up to battle (&s;ays I&s;rael) again&s;t my brother <HI>Benjamin?</HI> Yes, &s;aith the Lord, go. They repeat the enquiry again and again, (&s;tumbled, perhaps, at their ill &s;ucce&s;s) and the Lord as often repeats his affirmative an&s;wer, Go, go.</P>
<P>WAR, indeed, is an awful &s;cene; that man|kind, all made of one blood, &s;hould kill and de|vour one another, and by the de&s;troying &s;word, make even rivers of human blood to flow&mdash;how horrible the thought!</P>
<P>THE individual that &s;heds the blood of ano|ther, by his own private will (except in &s;ome &s;in|gular ca&s;es of extreme nece&s;&s;ity) is guilty of the highe&s;t wrong to his neighbour&mdash;horribly violates the law, the righteous law of GOD and man&mdash;is
<PB N="8" REF="015602_0007_0F998D851B068888">
a murderer&mdash;near a-kin to him, who was a mur|derer from the beginning, and forfeits his life in|to the hands of ju&s;tice: And &s;hedding human blood in a more public way, by a community war|ring again&s;t another community, always, I think, mu&s;t carry a murderous guilt with it, unle&s;s the cau&s;e be great and good.</P>
<P>THE &s;word can never be lawfully u&s;ed for the &s;upport of an unju&s;t cau&s;e: Nor may a people have recour&s;e to arms, to redre&s;s every little tri|fling wrong, and &s;upport a real right and intere&s;t, if it be but &s;mall; for, if &s;o, the world would al|ways be full of wars, and con&s;tant &s;cenes of blood. Even rea&s;on, and plainly our holy chri&s;tian in&s;ti|tution, not only forbids private revenge, and re|quires forbearance of individuals towards their neighbours; but, it al&s;o, forbids communities con|tending by the &s;word, with other communities, a|bout &s;mall, and incon&s;iderable matters; or, in|deed, about their highe&s;t rights and intere&s;ts, 'till other, and milder mea&s;ures have been tried and pur&s;ued, as long as there was any encouragement to it, or any rational hope and pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>IF &s;in had not depraved the human heart, war had never been practi&s;ed among mankind. Not only private and per&s;onal feuds and quarrels, but al&s;o public and national ones, derive their origi|nal from the lu&s;ts of men. War has always a &s;inful root and cau&s;e &s;omewhere; I &s;uppo&s;e it ne|ver can po&s;&s;ibly be ju&s;t on both &s;ides, in any cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="9" REF="015602_0008_0F998D88A033C258">
what&s;oever; yet, on one &s;ide, it cer|tainly may be.</P>
<P>THE great Sovereign, the righteous Governor of the world has committed his &s;word into the magi&s;trates hand, to re&s;train therewith, or if ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to de&s;troy the wicked; that &s;o his people may be in a capacity to "<HI>lead quiet and peaceable lives in godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI>" (For you are to know that the end and aim of every ju&s;t and lawful war is peace, &s;afety and happine&s;s, in the way of duty and obedience to the great Sovereign, our com|mon Lord.)</P>
<P>THE Magi&s;trate is not only to defend his &s;ub|jects from private violence, but al&s;o from pub|lic and national injury and abu&s;e: And where there is no &s;ettled form of government&mdash;no &s;u|preme &s;tanding magi&s;trate, to whom this tru&s;t has been properly delegated, there the right and authority to defend them&s;elves from extreme dan|ger and abu&s;e&mdash;to re&s;train, and if it cannot other|wi&s;e be done, even to de&s;troy the notoriou&s;ly wicked and injurious, is in the hands of the peo|ple.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find the common-wealth of I&s;rael, when they had no &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, to whom they had committed this tru&s;t to ma|nage it for them, once and again acting in virtue of this right them&s;elves, on nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions. Thus the ten tribes intended to make war upon their brethren, on the other &s;ide of <HI>Jordan,</HI> be|cau&s;e,
<PB N="10" REF="015602_0009_0F998D8A159CBAE8">
as they &s;uppo&s;ed, they had fallen off from the true wor&s;hip of the GOD of I&s;rael, into ido|latry&mdash;and actually did &s;o, again&s;t their bre|thren of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> for protecting the perpetra|tors of an horrid crime, from de&s;erved puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>IF the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, in a community, violates the &s;acred tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by the people, if "<HI>in&s;tead of being a mini&s;ter of God for good</HI>" unto them, he becomes an oppre&s;&s;or, di&s;regards the con&s;titution, by which he was as much bound as the people, and which gave him all the authority, which he has over them&mdash;if he wantonly tramples on their mo&s;t important and &s;acred rights, and is deaf to their multiplied, du|tiful and loyal complaints and prayers, for re|dre&s;s of their grievances and wrongs, 'till there remains no hope in this way, but their oppre&s;&s;i|ons, are continued, encrea&s;ed, and multiplied up|on them more and more; they have a plain right in the &s;ight of Heaven and earth, to recall the delegated power, that is thus abu&s;ed; otherwi&s;e, the ca&s;e of the people would be wretched in|deed; ina&s;much as tho&s;e that are exalted, in power, above others, are &s;o apt to abu&s;e it, and turn oppre&s;&s;ors, and to per&s;i&s;t irreclaimably in it when they have &s;o done. If the people have not a right to recal this delegated power, when, thus gro&s;ly abu&s;ed; they had better (I think) never entru&s;t it in the hands of any man, but keep it in their own.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="015602_0010_0F998D8A680A88B8">
As to the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance, it is &s;o contrary to religion, and even to common &s;en&s;e, that it is high time it were bani&s;hed out of the world. It flatters and &s;up|ports Tyrants in their pride and wickedne&s;s, and is highly injurious to the rights of human na|ture: It has been &s;o often, &s;o &s;olidly and clearly confuted, by many worthy treati&s;es, wrote, &s;ome in the&s;e times, and &s;ome in former unhappy times, &s;imilar to the&s;e; &s;ome or other of which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have fallen into the hands of almo&s;t every one, unle&s;s any have been &s;trange|ly and criminally inattentive to the very impor|tant and intere&s;ting &s;cenes that have been acting of late, between Britain and America, that it is needle&s;s, as it would probably be fruitle&s;s, to add many words upon it.</P>
<P>AWAY with that unrea&s;onable doctrine of the divine right of Kings, or any other magi&s;trates, in that ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e in which &s;ome plead for it. In a &s;ober, qualified &s;en&s;e, I believe this doctrine: I believe that magi&s;tracy is of divine right; but I believe withal, that GOD has left it with the people, to choo&s;e their form of Government, and appoint and con&s;titute the magi&s;trate; although he expects them to act the rational part herein, and commit this great tru&s;t, only into &s;uitable and proper hands. "<HI>The powers that be, are or|dained of God;</HI>" but, if I mi&s;take not, this ra|ther refers to Government in its various forms, than to Governors&mdash;to the office, rather than the per&s;on who &s;hall fill it. Even in this, the provi|dence
<PB N="12" REF="015602_0011_0F998D8B37574450">
of GOD is not to be denied, for it extends it&s;elf to all events; but none, I believe, can &s;hew an ordinance of God, that this or that individual or family in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hall fill the &s;upreme office of magi&s;tracy, in this or the other community.</P>
<P>THE great Governor of the world, from a kind regard to the welfare of mankind, hath ordained that there &s;hall be magi&s;tracy among them; and when a community have, regularly and or|derly &s;ettled this authority upon particular men, they have a divine right to execute ju&s;t that au|thority over the people, that is thus committed into their hands, but no more. I believe they have now, a divine right to rule well; but not to oppre&s;s the people, and infringe and tram|ple on their highe&s;t rights; which, if they do, and per&s;i&s;t in it, again&s;t the repeated complaints and prayers of the people, for redre&s;s of wrongs, pro|tracted even to long &s;uffering; I believe that as it was by covenant pointing out the duty of each party, and carrying in it the &s;olemn engage|ment of each to conduct accordingly, that they came into the relation of King (&s;uppo&s;e) and &s;ubjects; this re&s;olved unrelenting violation on the one part&punc; di&s;&s;olves the obligation of it on the other; &s;o that the people have a divine right to take the forfeiture, renounce their allegiance, and take the be&s;t care of them&s;elves they can.</P>
<P>AND, if &s;uch an oppre&s;&s;or pur&s;ues them with the &s;word for &s;o doing, I believe he greatly adds to his &s;in hereby, and incurs the awful di&s;plea&s;ure
<PB N="13" REF="015602_0012_0F998D8BE7492100">
of the great &s;overeign, his ma&s;ter, as well as theirs. And that the people have a divine right, in ca&s;e of &s;uch manife&s;t, extreme wrong&mdash;&s;uch wanton abu&s;e of power to en&s;lave or de&s;troy them, to take the &s;word too, for their own de|fence.</P>
<P>NOT only may one State u&s;e the Sword again&s;t another, in ca&s;es of weighty and urgent nece&s;&s;ity, but &s;o likewi&s;e may a part of the State, again&s;t the other part of the &s;ame, in like ca&s;es. Not only may a people, driven to it by unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity, draw the &s;word again&s;t a foreign nation, but &s;o may they likewi&s;e, again&s;t their own bre|thren, tho' it is an awful thing indeed, and &s;hould be con&s;idered as a &s;ore frown of Heaven on the whole community, that ever there &s;hould be occa&s;i|on for it. Such, evidently was the ca&s;e with I&s;rael, in the awful &s;cene, my text refers to; the chil|dren of <HI>Benjamin</HI> were their brethren&mdash;a part of the &s;ame Common-wealth with them&s;elves; and yet their de&s;ign of making war upon them, for a gro&s;s and ob&s;tinate violation of equity and right, the righteous Sovereign of the world expre&s;sly approves, and repeatedly bids them go on with it: And this, by the way, was an offen&s;ive war; and if that was lawful and right, how much more evidently and apparently, a defen&s;ive one, to ward off the a&s;&s;aults of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>AGAINST what has been offered, perhaps it may be &s;aid, by way of objection,</P>
<P>IT is enough for the Heathen, who know
<PB N="14" REF="015602_0013_0F998D8CA07EDCE8">
not God, to fight and devour one another; Chri&s;|tians &s;urely &s;hould not fight.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, Chri&s;tians &s;hould never give occa&s;i|on for the u&s;e of the &s;word; nor &s;hould they, lightly and ha&s;tily take occa&s;ion to u&s;e it: But let them &s;hew that can, where chri&s;tians are re|quired to give up their liberty, and &s;ubmit to &s;la|very&mdash;to give up their property and the great rights which indulgent Heaven has inve&s;t|ed them withal, in common with the re&s;t of man|kind, at the demand of an a&s;&s;uming community, with a Tyrant at the head of it, rather than de|fend them&s;elves by the &s;word if it be in their power to do it, again&s;t &s;uch great and manife&s;t injury and wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. THE go&s;pel every where requires forbearance, and forbids revenge.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> WHEN there is the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for u&s;ing the &s;word, it mu&s;t not be from malice, and a de&s;ire of revenge: Wo to them that u&s;e it thus, be it in ever &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e: Its ju&s;t and lawful u&s;e, even on the weightie&s;t occa&s;ions, is to obtain peace and quietne&s;s on terms of rea&s;on and right, which cannot otherwi&s;e be had: And further, if the objectors will impartially con&s;ult their Bibles again, I am per&s;uaded they will find, that the mo&s;t, if not all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, on which this objection is grounded, refer to private revenge of private and per&s;onal injuries, and do not forbid a community to defend them&s;elves
<PB N="15" REF="015602_0014_0F998D8D5C21C070">
from violence, and right them&s;elves from extreme wrong, not otherwi&s;e to be righted, even by the &s;word. If this be duly attended to, I think it will certainly di&s;pel a cloud of objections again&s;t the point in hand, rai&s;ed from the&s;e and &s;uch like &s;criptures, <HI>Render to no man evil for evil. Do vi|olence to no man. If any man will take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke al&s;o. If any &s;mite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o. Put up thy &s;word into the &s;heath, for all they that take the &s;word, &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word,</HI> &amp;c."</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 3. WHATEVER was allowed and practi&s;ed in this re&s;pect, under the law, yet there is no al|lowance for it now under the go&s;pel,</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> THIS point&mdash;the lawfulne&s;s or unlawful|ne&s;s of u&s;ing the &s;word, on urgent occa&s;ions, does not belong to the ceremonial law, but to the moral law, or law of nature, which is fixed and invariable, from the beginning to the end of time; and abides ju&s;t the &s;ame, through all the various di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD to his Church, in way of ceremonial, or po&s;&s;itive law. Therefore, the u&s;e of the &s;word having been lawful heretofore, is plainly &s;o now, and always will be, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances. Self-pre&s;erva|tion, &s;elf-defence from extreme violence and wrong, is the great and univer&s;al law of nature, which I dare &s;ay the go&s;pel does not di&s;annul; for I have the Apo&s;tle's affidavit, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> St, Paul's, to &s;upport me in it: "<HI>Do we make void the law, through faith?

<P>So among others, we find upon a certain time, a centurion, a captain over an hundred &s;oldiers, coming to Chri&s;t, with a reque&s;t that he would heal his &s;ervant that was &s;ick; upon which, that great Teacher &s;ent from GOD, who was con&s;tant|ly careful, on all occa&s;ions, to reprove the faults, and rectify the mi&s;takes of the people, dont con|demn his calling, and bid him relinqui&s;h it, burn his commi&s;&s;ion&mdash;throw away his &s;word, and be|take him&s;elf to an hone&s;ter occupation; but ra|ther, he be&s;tows a high encomium upon him; "<HI>I have not found &s;o great faith, no not in I&s;rael.</HI>" And here, by the way, we plainly &s;ee one very

good man of the military profe&s;&s;ion, under the go&s;pel. Oh! would to God, our centurions, our officers of every rank, and &s;oldiers; yea, and we too, who &s;tay by the &s;tuff, were of a like cha|racter, with him.</P>
<P>BUT, perhaps it may be thought to be need|le&s;s, to in&s;i&s;t &s;o long on a point &s;o plain and clear: Well, my friend, &s;uppo&s;e it is &s;ufficiently plain to me and thee; yet, &s;ome of our brethren pro|fe&s;s (and peradventure, this may be ju&s;t the ca&s;e with a number more, who do not openly profe&s;s it) that it is not &s;o plain to them: Some profe&s;s to believe the cau&s;e, in which we are engaged, is not ju&s;t; others are wavering and not e&s;tabli&s;hed as to the right and ju&s;tice of it, and are ea&s;ily &s;taggered by &s;tumbling-blocks thrown in their way, and carried away by a plau&s;ibility of argument: Now, if the cau&s;e depending be, in thy mind and mine, not only ju&s;t and good, but al&s;o, exceeding great and important, is it not worth while to take &s;ome pains, clearly to prove it out, and confirm it, in order to &s;ettle and e&s;tabli&s;h the doubting, and wavering; and if it may be, to convince the mi&s;|taken; or el&s;e if that cannot be, to leave them the more without excu&s;e?</P>
<P>And now, my brethren, who are not &s;atisfied of the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e in which we are en|gaged, for our defence, again&s;t the ho&s;tile inva|&s;ions of Britain; if any &s;uch hear me (and be that as it may, yet very probably curio&s;ity will

lead &s;ome &s;uch to read the&s;e lines, now they are offered to a more public view) upon what ground can you rai&s;e an objection, which, my &s;ubject fairly con&s;idered and regarded, will not effectu|ally remove? That I&s;rael's taking the &s;word, and going to war again&s;t <HI>Benjamin,</HI> was ju&s;t and right, I think you will not deny; for when they con&s;ulted Heaven upon it, once and again, by &s;olemn fa&s;ting and prayer, the Lord expre&s;sly &s;aid, go. Was it for &s;kreening notorious offen|ders from public ju&s;tice, that I&s;rael made war upon <HI>Benjamin?</HI> Yes. Well, and has not Great-Britain, among many other unju&s;t and unrea&s;on|able proceedings, done nearly the &s;ame thing? I allude to an act of the Briti&s;h Parliament, for exempting their &s;oldiers that &s;hould be impeach|ed for murders, committed in America, from being tried, in order to their being puni&s;hed if found guilty, by the law of the land. Are the Britons our brethren? So were the <HI>Benjamites</HI> theirs&mdash;Are we the profe&s;&s;ing people of GOD? So were they&mdash;Or if it be &s;aid, that &s;cene was acted under the law, when many things were permitted, that are unlawful now, under the go&s;|pel; I reply, it was not a bare permi&s;&s;ion, that I&s;|rael had to wage war again&s;t <HI>Benjamin,</HI> but an ex|pre&s;s command, and repeated too, go, go: And though it was indeed, under the law (ceremoni|al) yet it was a point that did not belong to that law: and therefore, it makes no odds at all, whe|ther it were under, or during the authority of that law, or not; but it belongs to the law natu|ral and moral, which forbad I&s;rael every thing
<PB N="19" REF="015602_0018_0F998D922C805D50">
that it fordids us; and indulges Chri&s;tians in e|very thing that it did the Jews: It allowed them undeniably, in an offen&s;ive war again&s;t their bre|thren of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> becau&s;e they undertook to &s;kreen notorious criminals from public ju&s;tice; and with what face then, or appearance of truth and rea&s;on, can it be pretended, that it does not allow us in a defen&s;ive war with our brethren of Britain, who, after they have done the &s;ame, and a great many other high-handed acts of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion again&s;t us, have &s;ent their Fleets and Armies&mdash;an huge ho&s;t, &s;word in hand, to rivet on our chains of &s;lavery, or el&s;e de&s;troy us.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for a per|&s;on, who has his mind free from prejudice, and undue influence from every quarter; and has but a tolerable acquaintance with the &s;tate and grounds of our controver&s;y with Great-Britain; and fairly compares it with the awful &s;cene in the common-wealth of I&s;rael, now under con&s;idera|tion, any longer to doubt or he&s;itate about the lawfulne&s;s of the pre&s;ent war, on the part of America.</P>

<Q><HI>Then all the Children of I&s;rael, and all the people went up, and came unto the Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, <HI>and wept, and &s;at there before the Lord, and fa&s;ted that day, until even, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings before the Lord.

<P>WE have con&s;idered, that in cer|tain circum&s;tances, of urgent nece&s;&s;ity, it is ju&s;t and right, and agreeable to the will of GOD, for his own profe&s;&s;ing people to take the &s;word, and go to war, even again&s;t their brethren.</P>
<P>LET us proceed, and con&s;ider, according to <HI>Prop.</HI> 2. That in fir&s;t commencing, and af|ter pro&s;ecuting a war, e&s;pecially with brethren,
<PB N="22" REF="015602_0020_0F998D95859F6C30">
there &s;hould be a fair, impartial, often-repeated enquiry into the right of it; that we may act with a &s;afe con&s;cience, and be able to ju&s;tify our proceeding.</P>
<P>So did the children of I&s;rael, with re&s;pect to the war with their Brethren of <HI>Benjamin;</HI> they do not ru&s;h precipitately upon it, but fir&s;t they &s;eriou&s;ly deliberate the matter with them&s;elves, and weigh the merits of the cau&s;e; whether it requires, and will ju&s;tify &s;uch a procedure: Thus they call upon one another, as the fir&s;t &s;tep to be ta|ken, "<HI>Con&s;ider of it, take advice and &s;peak your minds</HI>" And not only did they &s;eriou&s;ly weigh and delibe|rate the matter, with them&s;elves, but they a&s;k coun|&s;el of the Lord about it too, previous to the fir&s;t beginning of the war, and repeatedly afterwards, during the continuance of it. No important enterprize &s;hould ever be engaged in, without &s;e|rious fore-thought, and enquiry after the path of duty, "<HI>Remember and &s;hew your&s;elves men</HI>" let rea&s;on &s;earch out the path of duty, and then let action follow, and exertion in proportion to the greater or le&s;s importance of the cau&s;e; <HI>Yea and why, even of your&s;elves, judge ye not what is right.</HI>"</P>
<P>REASON is to be con&s;ulted, but Heaven mu&s;t be con&s;ulted too: "<HI>He that tru&s;ts in his own Heart, is a fool.

and the voice of rea&s;on, is always the voice of GOD; but our manifold corruptions and preju|dices, are in the greate&s;t danger, &s;o to blind and deceive us, as to make us think that to be the voice of rea&s;on which is not; therefore, in &s;earching out the dictates of rea&s;on, we mu&s;t make diligent and hone&s;t enquiry at the oracles of GOD, and prayerfully con&s;ult the &s;acred pages of revelation, where things are &s;tripped of their fal&s;e gui&s;es and deceitful &s;hows; and &s;et to view in their &s;imple truth: Withal, applying our&s;elves to the Father of Lights&mdash;the fountain of Truth, "<HI>who giveth wi&s;dom liberally, to them that</HI> (hone&s;t|ly) <HI>a&s;k it of him, without upbraiding,</HI>" to keep us from a fal&s;e judgement, and mi&s;taken apprehen|&s;ion of things, which would embolden us to en|gage in ra&s;h and unju&s;tifiable enterprizes.

<P><PB N="24" REF="015602_0022_0F998D972368BA50">
ALTHOUGH, in re&s;pect to the controver&s;y, be|tween Britain and America, which has been &s;ome time ripened into the pre&s;ent awful &s;cene of war, there is no doubt but that America has been faulty in many things; it is &s;carce ever other|wi&s;e, in public or private feuds and quarrels, that are carried to any con&s;iderable length, but that there is blame, more or le&s;s, on both &s;ides: It is hard, for &s;uch depraved creatures to bear grievous injuries and wrongs, without being thrown out of proper temper by it, and getting quite be&s;ide the path of duty: yet, I think, as it is plain that Britain was the aggre&s;&s;or, by whom the offence came; who fir&s;t took the &s;word, and began the quarrel; &s;o it is pretty evident to a fair, and impartial mind, that America (I &s;peak not of individuals; the &s;peeches and conduct of &s;ome of the&s;e have been utterly too ra&s;h and unju&s;ti|fiable; but of our public councils; the repre&s;en|tative bodies of America) have proceeded with very con&s;iderable deliberation, moderation and caution, while matters were coming on to this &s;ad pa&s;s, as much as could be rationally expect|ed, under &s;uch &s;ore "oppre&s;&s;ion as makes even the wi&s;e man mad," and bare and forbare, until violence had ri&s;en to &s;uch an height, as to make it a matter of plain duty, and indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;i|ty, to take the &s;word for &s;elf defence: And, be|fore and &s;ince the commencement of the war, we have been frequently &s;etting apart days of fa&s;ting and prayer, profe&s;&s;edly on the de&s;ign of a&s;king coun&s;el and direction of Heaven, how we &s;hould proceed and conduct, in the embarra&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="25" REF="015602_0023_0F998D97EB90B5C0">
and very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;tate of our affairs; which, were they attended only with a moral &s;incerity, I doubt not but they would be followed with &s;ome happy con&s;equences: But I fear the mo&s;t of us do not ob&s;erve them &s;o well as that&mdash;do not attend them with that concern, and thoughtfulne&s;s, that even natural con&s;cience, and the common law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, might well be expected to engage us to, at &s;uch an aw|ful day as the pre&s;ent is, when a cau&s;e of &s;uch high importance hangs, wavering, in doubtful expec|tation. Do not many of us regard the&s;e &s;olemn days, only as mere matters of form, without heart, without the thoughtfulne&s;s, and proper temper and exerci&s;es of men, as well as without the piety and &s;incerity of chri&s;tians? and &s;o, on|ly mock, and in&s;ult Heaven, while we profe&s;s to humble our&s;elves before the Lord, and a&s;k coun|&s;el of him. But, oh! beware my friends, what you do. This is exceedingly provoking to GOD, and dangerous to your&s;elves. However, I tru&s;t there is a goodly number, &s;cattered here and there, who truly fear the Lord, and tremble un|der his up-lifted hand; who, on the&s;e occa&s;ions e&s;pecially, and indeed from day to day, are mour|ning before the Lord, for the &s;ins of the Land, particularly their own, which have provoked him to &s;uffer matters to come to this &s;ad pa&s;s with us; and &s;en&s;ible of the great need of divine guidance and conduct in &s;uch an awful embarra&s;&s;ed, and threatning &s;tate of things as we are in, are earne&s;t|ly a&s;king coun&s;el and direction of Heaven; But as to a great many, I fear they are exceeding
<PB N="26" REF="015602_0024_0F998D98A82BC488">
faulty, in not taking proper care and pains, by &s;eri|ous, prayerful enquiry, to inform them&s;elves into the &s;tate of the controver&s;y in hand, and about the rea&s;on and right of our cau&s;e: And yet, perhaps they are zealou&s;ly engaged, &s;ome on one &s;ide, and &s;ome on the other, while they neither know, nor &s;e|riou&s;ly concern them&s;elves to know with any clear, di&s;tinct knowledge, what the cau&s;e is. How can you be &s;ure to walk &s;afe, when you do not know what ground you go upon? If the cau&s;e is good and ju&s;t, what is that to you that neglect to &s;earch it out as far as in you lies, and be at rea&s;onable and proper pains to &s;ee it to be &s;o? Will you act in matters of weightie&s;t importance, upon a meer pre&s;umption of right, without a rational &s;ight, and con&s;cientious &s;atisfaction thereof? It will never do to &s;ee merely with others eyes, and take things of weighty importance upon tru&s;t, where the way is open and fair, by proper enqui|ry to &s;ee for our&s;elves. The awful &s;cene now acting, mu&s;t certainly have a further hearing: And how without a &s;erious enquiry into the right of it, &s;hall they that act for the cau&s;e, be able to ju&s;tify their conduct at the great day? How &s;hall they know but they are bringing blood guiltine&s;s upon them&s;elves? And how, without a fair en|quiry, &s;hall they that oppo&s;e the public mea&s;ures of the day, or only &s;tand neuters, know but they are bringing the cur&s;e of Heaven (as well as Earth) upon them&s;elves? As it is written, "cur&s;e ye Meroz, cur&s;e ye bitterly, the inhabitants there|of; becau&s;e they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the Lord, again&s;t the
<PB N="27" REF="015602_0025_0F998D995C3413D8">
mighty." Verily, the cau&s;e depending, is too great and &s;olemn, to be treated with a carele&s;s indifferency: if it be an unju&s;t cau&s;e, wo be to them that put an hand to it, to &s;hed blood un|ju&s;tly; and that the blood of brethren: If it is ju&s;t, I am &s;ure it is great, and calls upon all to join heart and hand for its &s;upport; left even by a neutrality in &s;o important a cau&s;e, they greatly &s;in again&s;t them&s;elves, again&s;t the public, again&s;t po&s;terity and again&s;t Heaven too. Therefore, what I urge here is, that every one that is capa|ble of it, will &s;eriou&s;ly and prayerfully, without prejudice or undue influence from any quarter whatever; and with the be&s;t helps he can get to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, examine and &s;earch out the cau&s;e for him&s;elf; hone&s;tly endeavoring to &s;ee it in its &s;imple, undi&s;gui&s;ed truth; that he may know how to act with a &s;afe con&s;cience, and &s;o as to be able to an&s;wer it, another day. Say not, it is too late now, to make enquiry into the merits of the cau&s;e: It is true, it &s;hould have been done by every one capable of it, long ago; but if it has not been &s;eriou&s;ly attended to, thoroughly deli|berated, and brought to a rational i&s;&s;ue in any of your minds, it is high time to do it now, and better late than never&mdash;if it has, yet, in &s;o weigh|ty and &s;olemn a matter, there is the greate&s;t pro|priety in a further, and often-repeated enquiry; after the example of I&s;rael, in my text and con|text.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e depending is plainly, one that nearly concerns the honor of GOD, and our Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical,
<PB N="28" REF="015602_0026_0F998D9A24328A60">
religious intere&s;t, as well as civil and &s;ecular welfare: And therefore, if we have gone in a wrong path, it is time to &s;ee it, and &s;top, be the con&s;equence as it may: But if in a right one&mdash;if our cau&s;e is ju&s;t, it is high time we were all rationally &s;atisfied of it; and, with a cordi|al union, and &s;pirited re&s;olution, engaged for the &s;upport of it.</P>
<P><HI>Prop</HI> 3. IT is nothing &s;trange, or new, if in pro&s;ecuting a ju&s;t war, we meet with &s;evere and repeated rebukes of Heaven, for our &s;ins.</P>
<P>MANKIND are apt to judge of a cau&s;e by its good or bad &s;ucce&s;s, and that from &s;ome of the fir&s;t and earlie&s;t events that turn up; and before it comes any thing near the turning point, and final i&s;&s;ue. This has been the ca&s;e with &s;ome, in re&s;pect to the controver&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us and Britain.</P>
<P>BUT where did we learn that a good cau&s;e &s;hall certainly have a con&s;tant, uninterrupted &s;e|ries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es, from beginning to end; or that a bad cau&s;e is never attended with any fortunate events, that for the pre&s;ent, &s;eem to favor and &s;upport it?&mdash;Not from a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation of the cour&s;e of things in our world, under the ad|mini&s;tration of the great Sovereign&mdash;Not from the &s;acred &s;criptures, certainly: When I&s;|rael was come over Jordan, to root out the inha|bitants of Canaan, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their land, certainly their cau&s;e was ju&s;t, for they were
<PB N="29" REF="015602_0027_0F998D9AED2A06E8">
acting by expre&s;s orders from Heaven; yet they had not an uninterrupted cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;es. When they went up again&s;t Ai, they were repul|&s;ed with lo&s;s. There may be other Achans, be|&s;ides a bad cau&s;e, which may occa&s;ion bad &s;ucce&s;s. So when I&s;rael went to war again&s;t their brother <HI>Benjamin,</HI> they were right in this, their cau&s;e was ju&s;t, GOD repeatedly approves of it, and bids them go on with it: And yet they met with ve|ry awful &s;cenes of divine rebuke, and ill &s;ucce&s;s, in the pro&s;ecution of it: Their two fir&s;t encoun|ters with <HI>Benjamin,</HI> co&s;t them no le&s;s than forty thou&s;and lives, with the lo&s;s of the battle, each time; &s;o that it is no new thing, for a people, pro&s;ecuting a ju&s;t cau&s;e, to meet with &s;ore frowns and rebukes of Heaven, by the way:</P>
<P>AND therefore, according to <HI>Prop.</HI> 4. Al|though this calls for mourning and deep humilia|tion before GOD, and a &s;erious concern to obtain pardon and reconciliation with him, yet it is no &s;ufficient ground of di&s;couragement, from a fur|ther pro&s;ecution of the cau&s;e, with hope in the mercy of GOD, to &s;upport and carry it through, in his own wi&s;e and holy, time and way.</P>
<P>THIS head, I con&s;ider as the improvement of my &s;ubject, and accordingly, &s;hall handle it with a more expre&s;s and particular application to our own ca&s;e. We &s;ee the conduct of I&s;rael in my text, it is a worthy example; I pray come, let us &s;et upon the imitation of it. Not only do they en|quire and &s;earch further into the cau&s;e, upon re|peated
<PB N="30" REF="015602_0028_0F998D9C08E3C5A8">
ill &s;ucce&s;s, to &s;ee if it be agreeable to the di|vine will, that they pro&s;ecute it &s;till (which I have already &s;poken to) but al&s;o, with great and &s;erious concern, they &s;et them&s;elves to enquire out the cau&s;e of the&s;e &s;ore misfortunes, which had befallen them, and to put it away: "<HI>They went up to the Hou&s;e of God, and wept, and &s;at there before the Lord, and fa&s;ted until even; and of|fered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings before the Lord.</HI>"</P>
<P>WE are following their example this day, in externals: O that we might al&s;o, in the &s;pirit and truth of the&s;e great duties, which we find them here engaged in. Many awful &s;cenes have turned up, &s;ince the commencement of this un|happy war, with our brethren of Britain; much American, as well as Briti&s;h blood has been &s;hed: The enemy has at one time and another, gotten con&s;iderable advantage again&s;t us: And could we rea&s;onably expect any other, even in the natural cour&s;e of things? Could a cau&s;e, &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced as ours, be carried on without &s;uch &s;cenes of calamity and di&s;tre&s;s attending it, un|le&s;s the Lord would work very miracles for us, to prevent it? (which we have no rea&s;on to ex|pect.) But as all events are in the hand of GOD, &s;o the mo&s;t natural occurrences are capable of a moral view, and &s;hould be ever con&s;idered by us in that light: And in a moral view, that is to &s;ay, in a view of the character of the great Go|vernor of the world, and our own character as a people, had we not rea&s;on to expect all this
<PB N="31" REF="015602_0029_0F998D9CAB6A3648">
that has already befallen us? Yea, and a great deal more &s;courging and correction from the Lord's righteous hand. Even though our cau&s;e was good, and he was determined to &s;up|port it, and give us the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, in the end. The &s;erious, &s;en&s;ible and thinking part of America were, even ready to tremble with awful concern, at our plunging into this unnatu|ral war with Britain, to think what a &s;ore &s;courge the righteous Governor of the world, would pro|bably make it to us, according to his wonted way with his people, under great degeneracy; even while they were fully per&s;uaded of the ju&s;|tice of the cau&s;e, and duty of pro&s;ecuting it; and entertained withal, a comfortable hope that it would plea&s;e him to crown our efforts with final &s;ucce&s;s. When I&s;rael met with repeated and heavy frowns and lo&s;&s;es in the war with their brother <HI>Benjamin, "they wept before the Lord,"</HI> not only, nor chiefly, for their ill &s;ucce&s;s, but al|&s;o and e&s;pecially, for their &s;ins, whereby they had procured the&s;e awful rebukes of Heaven&mdash;to be &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed, though on the right &s;ide of the que&s;tion, by the hand of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who were altogether in the wrong: Hereby they were con|vinced of &s;in, and brought to a concerned &s;en&s;e of their guilt, not in re&s;pect to the cau&s;e in hand, but in other things; in re&s;pect to their general character, as being now, a very degenerate, back|&s;lidden people, and of the divine anger again&s;t them herefor: Therefore they fall to offering &s;a|crifices of attonement to the offended Deity; which, if done in faith, looking forward, to the

great Propitiation to be offered in due time, to put away &s;in, with broken, penitent hearts, and a fixed re&s;olution (Divine Grace helping) to put away their &s;ins, and reform their lives, was ju&s;t the thing that Providence was &s;o loudly calling them to; the likelie&s;t, yea, a &s;ure way to better &s;ucce&s;s: And it is with manifold wi&s;dom, that the Lord takes this method with his people, e|ven when ju&s;tly called to arms, to cha&s;ten and correct them by the hand of the enemy, e&s;pecial|ly when they are grown very corrupt, before he &s;miles upon their enterpri&s;e, and works the de&s;i|red &s;alvation for them: Thus, he u&s;es to humble their pride, beat them off from &s;elf-de|pendance, and bring them to tru&s;t in him, &s;ee|ing all their hope and help to lie on him: Thus he prepares the way, for the glory of their deli|verance and &s;alvation to be given to him, to whom it of right belongs; which, otherwi&s;e, they would a&s;cribe to them&s;elves. This method is nece&s;&s;ary to be taken with them, to bring them to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, of GOD'S righte|ous anger thereat; and &s;o, of their awful dan|ger, and put them upon a concerned &s;eeking his reconciled face and favor; and thus prepare them for mercy, that it may be conferred upon them, in a way, honorary to GOD, and his go|vernment.</P>
