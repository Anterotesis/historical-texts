<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>REVELATIONS xxii. 21.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t be with you all. Amen.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is very remarkable that the old te&s;ta|ment ends with the word cur&s;e; whereby we are taught that the law made nothing perfect: but ble&s;&s;ed be God, the new te&s;tament ends otherwi&s;e, even a precious ble&s;|&s;ing, that glorious grace put into the heart, and dropt by the pen of the di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved.</P>
<P>My brethren, as the providence of God calls us now to bid each other a long farewel, can I part from you better than in enlarging a lit|tle upon this &s;hort but glorious prayer; can I wi&s;h you, or you me, better in time and eter|nity, than that the words of our text may be fulfilled in our hearts, <HI>the grace of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t be with you all, Amen.</HI> In opening which,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it will be proper to explain what we are to under&s;tand by the word grace.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="033217_0009_0FF68E7762552F40">
Secondly, what by the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and its being with us all; and then to ob&s;erve upon the word Amen: &s;hew|ing you why it is that every one of us may wi&s;h, that the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be with us all.</P>
<P>Perhaps, there is not a word in the book of God that has a greater variety of interpreta|tions put upon it than this little, this great word grace: I do not intend to &s;pin out, or wa&s;te the time by giving you all. It will be enough in general to ob&s;erve, that the word grace &s;ignifies favour, or may imply the general kindne&s;s that God bears to the world; but it &s;ignifies that here which I pray God we may all experience, I mean the grace, the &s;pecial grace of the ble&s;&s;ed God communicated to his people; not only his favour di&s;played to us outwardly, but the work of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit imparted and conveyed inwardly and mo&s;t powerfully to our &s;ouls, and this is what our church in the catechi&s;m calls &s;pecial grace; for though Je&s;us Chri&s;t in one re&s;pect is the Saviour of all, and we are to offer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preach.</NOTE> Je&s;us Chri&s;t univer&s;ally to all, yet he is &s;aid in a &s;pecial manner to be the &s;aviour of them that believe; &s;o that the word grace is a very com|plex word, and takes in all that the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God does for a poor &s;inner, from the moment he fir&s;t draws his breath, and brings him to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, till he is plea&s;ed to call him by death; and as it is begun in grace, it will be &s;wallowed up in an endle&s;s eternity of
<PB N="3" REF="033217_0010_0FF68E797214F028">
glory hereafter; this is called the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: why &s;o? becau&s;e it is pur|cha&s;ed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> for us by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: the law was given by Mo&s;es, but grace and truth, in the mo&s;t emphatical manner, came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of God. If it was not for the purcha&s;e of a Mediator's blood, if it was not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t had bought us with a price, even with the price of his own blood, you and I &s;hould never have had, you and I could never have had the grace of God manife&s;ted at all to our &s;ouls. The covenant of works being bro|ken, our fir&s;t parents &s;tood convicted before God: they were criminals, though they did not care to own it; condemn'd before God, and in them&s;elves, &s;o that like their children they made excu&s;es for their &s;in. Man by na|ture had but one neck, and if God had plea&s;|ed to have done it, he might ju&s;tly have cut it off at one blow; but no &s;ooner had man in|curred the cur&s;e of the law, but behold a Me|diator is provided under the character of the &s;eed of the woman, which &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head; implying what the Redeemer was fir&s;t to do without, and afterwards to do in the hearts of all his people: well therefore are we taught in our church collects to end all our prayers with the words, <HI>through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, brethren, this grace may be call|ed the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, becau&s;e it is not only purcha&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> by him, but it is conveyed into our hearts through Chri&s;t; the
<PB N="4" REF="033217_0011_0FF68E7BBA3ACCA0">
federal head of his glorious body, is a head of influence to tho&s;e for whom he &s;hed his blood: thus his di&s;ciple &s;aid, he was full of grace and truth, and out of his fulne&s;s we, all that are true believers, receive grace for grace; grace upon grace, &s;ays Mr. Blackwall, in his &s;acred cla&s;&s;icks: grace for grace, that is, &s;ays Luther, every grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, will be by his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit tran&s;cribed into every believ|er's heart, even as the warm wax receives the impre&s;s of the &s;eal upon it; as there is line up|on line upon the &s;eal left upon the wax, &s;o in a degree, though we come greatly &s;hort of what the law requires, the grace that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t is, in a mea&s;ure, implanted in our &s;ouls; but the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ble&s;&s;ed be God, has our &s;tock in his hands. God tru&s;ted man once, but never will more; he &s;et Adam up, gave him a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tock, placed him in a par|adi&s;e of love, and he &s;oon became a bankrupt, &s;ome think in twenty four hours, however, all agree it was in &s;ix or &s;even days, and that he never had but one &s;abbath; but now, ble&s;&s;ed be God, we are under a better di&s;pen&s;ation, our &s;tock is put into Chri&s;t's hands, he knows how to keep it, and us too; &s;o this grace may be &s;aid to be the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;ecured by his blood, and conveyed to our &s;ouls by his being the head of his church and people.</P>
<P>This grace has a variety of epithets put to it, and I que&s;tion whether there is any kind of grace but what the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t exerci|&s;es
<PB N="5" REF="033217_0012_0FF68E7DFAC322F8">
towards his people &s;ome way or other, eve|ry hour, every moment of the day.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, His re&s;training grace; why, if it was not for this, God's people would be ju&s;t as weak and wicked as other folks are: remem|ber what David &s;aid when Abigail came to him; he was going to kill a neighbour for affronting him, forgot that he was a P&s;almi&s;t, and was only acting as a creature: ble&s;&s;ed be God, &s;ays he, that has &s;ent thee to meet and keep me: My brethren, we may talk what we plea&s;e, and build upon our own &s;tock; we are ju&s;t like little children that will walk by them|&s;elves; well, &s;ays the father, walk alone then, they tumble down, get a broken brow, and then are glad to take hold of the father; thus Je&s;us Chri&s;t is always acting in a re&s;training way to his people; if it was not &s;o, by the blindne&s;s of their under&s;tandings, the corrup|tions of their hearts and affections, together with the perver&s;ene&s;s of their will, alas! alas! there is not a child of God that would not run away every day, if Chri&s;t did not re&s;train him!</P>
<P>Secondly, There is convicting grace, which from the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t acts every day and hour. Oh! it is a ble&s;&s;ed thing to be under the Redeemer's convicting grace! a man may &s;peak to the ear, but it is the Spirit of God alone can &s;peak to the heart: I am not &s;peak|ing of convicting grace that wounds before conver&s;ion, and gives us a &s;en&s;e of our &s;in and mi&s;ery; no, I mean convicting grace that fol|lows the believer from time to time. If a hea|then Socrates could &s;ay, that he had always a
<PB N="6" REF="033217_0013_0FF68E8012E426B0">
monitor with him to check him when he did ami&s;s, and direct him when he went right, &s;urely the chri&s;tian may &s;ay, and ble&s;&s;ed be God for it, that he has got a Je&s;us that kindly &s;hews him when he goes a&s;tray, and by his grace puts him into the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that his feet may not &s;lip; this is what the &s;hepherd does to his &s;heep when they have wandered; what does the &s;hepherd do, but &s;ends &s;ome little cur, his dog, after them, to bring them to the fold again? what does Je|&s;us Chri&s;t do in temptations, trials, and afflic|tions? he fetches his people home, and con|vinces them that they have done ami&s;s.</P>
<P>Then, thirdly, There is the converting grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Oh! what poor unhappy creatures are they, that think they can turn to God when they plea&s;e, to which abominable principle it is owing, that they leave it till they cannot turn in their beds: Sa|tan tells them then, it is too late, their con|&s;ciences are filled with horror, and they go off in a whirlwind; may this be the ca&s;e of none here! That is a mo&s;t excellent prayer in our Communion Office, <HI>Turn us, O good Lord, and we &s;hall be turned:</HI> we can no more turn our hearts than we can turn the world up&s;ide down; it is the Redeemer, by his Spirit, mu&s;t take away the heart of &s;tone, and by the in|fluence of the holy Spirit give us a heart of fle&s;h. I might as well attempt to reach the heavens with my hand; I might as well go to &s;ome church-yard and command the dead to ri&s;e; I might as &s;oon &s;hake my handkerchief
<PB N="7" REF="033217_0014_0FF68E824B057CC8">
and bid the &s;treams divide, and they give way, as to expect a &s;oul to turn to God without the grace of a Mediator. Come, my dear hearers, I am of a good man's opinion, that prayed he might be converted every day. In the divine life, not to go forwards is to go backwards; and it is one great part of the work of the &s;pirit of God, to convert the &s;oul from &s;omething that is wrong to &s;omething that is right, every dry, hour and moment of the believer's life, &s;o that in &s;hort his life is one continued act of converting grace: there is not a day but there is &s;omething wrong; there is &s;omething we want to have taken away; we want to get rid of the old man, and to get more of the new man, and &s;o the Spirit of God works every day: O! my brethren, God give us more of this converting grace!</P>
<P>Then there is e&s;tabli&s;hing grace. David prays, <HI>Create in me a new heart, and renew a right &s;pirit within me;</HI> in the margin, it is con|&s;tant &s;pirit; and you hear of &s;ome that are rooted and grounded in the love of God, and the apo&s;tle prays, that they may always abound in the work of the Lord: again, it is good to have the heart e&s;tabli&s;hed with grace: there is a good many people have &s;ome religion in them, but they are not e&s;tabli&s;hed; hence they are mere weather-cocks, turned about by every wind of doctrine; and you may as &s;oon mea|&s;ure the moon for a &s;uit of clothes, as &s;ome people that are always changing; this is for want of more grace, more of the Spirit of God; and as children grow that are got &s;tronger and
<PB N="8" REF="033217_0015_0FF68E8531E5A6B0">
riper, &s;o as people grow in grace, and in the knowledge of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they will be more &s;ettled, more confirmed: on fir&s;t &s;et|ting out they prattle, but they will be more manly, more firm, more &s;teady: young Chri&s;|tians are like little rivulets that make a large noi&s;e, and have &s;hallow water; old Chri&s;|tians are like deep water that makes little noi&s;e, carries a good load, and gives not way.</P>
<P>What think you, my brethren, of the Re|deemer's comforting grace? O! what can you do without it? <HI>In the multitude of my thoughts within me,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>thy comforts have refre&s;hed my &s;oul.</HI> I believe you will all find what lord Bolinbrooke, in &s;pite of all his fine learning, and dei&s;tical principles, found when under affliction; he &s;ent a letter which I &s;aw and heard read to me, at lea&s;t that part of it in which he &s;ays: <HI>Now I am under this afflic|tion, I find my philo&s;ophy fails me.</HI> With all our philo&s;ophy and &s;triving, it is too hard to work our&s;elves into a pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate: alas! it is commendable to &s;trive, but we &s;hall never be content, we &s;hall never be cheerful under &s;uf|ferings, but through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Re|deemer. Even now, in re&s;pect of parting from one another, what can comfort friends when &s;eparated, but the Spirit of God. Paul, when going away for Jeru&s;alem, &s;aid, <HI>What mean ye to weep and break my heart?</HI> he al&s;o &s;ays, <HI>I am ready not to be bound only, but al&s;o to die at Jeru&s;alem, for the name of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> which he could not have &s;aid, had he not felt the comforting grace of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,

Our Lord, when going away, &s;ays, <HI>I will &s;end the Comforter;</HI> I will not leave you comfortle&s;s and helple&s;s, I will come again: the Lord helps the believer from time to time. We can ea&s;ily, my brethren, talk when not under the rod our&s;elves; there is not a phy&s;ician or apothecary in London but can give good ad|vice, but when they are &s;ick them&s;elves, poor &s;ouls! they are ju&s;t like their patients, and many times are more impatient than tho&s;e they u&s;ed to preach patience to; &s;o it is with the greate&s;t Chri&s;tian, we are all men of like pa&s;&s;ions, there is not one of us when under the rod, if left to our&s;elves, but would cur&s;e God, and Ephraim like, <HI>be as a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke;</HI> and there are many here, I do not doubt, that have &s;aid to the Redeemer, <HI>What do&s;t thou?</HI> or, perhaps, with Jonah, <HI>We do well to be angry;</HI> if the Lord does but take away his goard from us, if he is plea&s;ed to baulk us in regard to the creatures, how un|comfortable are we? and there are &s;o many afflictions and trials, that if it was not for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's comfortings no fle&s;h could bear them.</P>
<P>In a word, what think you, my brethren, of the quickning grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Remember David &s;ays, <HI>Quicken me according to thy word, quicken me in thy way, quicken me in thy righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> God's people want quickening every day; this is trimming our lamps, girding up the loins of our minds, &s;tiring up the gift of God that is in us. It is ju&s;t with a &s;oul as it is with the plants and

trees; how would it be with them if the Lord did not command quickening life to them after the winter? the believer has his fro&s;ty and win|ter days, and wo be to them that think they have always a &s;ummer; the believer at times can &s;ay, <HI>The winter is pa&s;t, the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the &s;inging of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land, the fig-tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grapes give a good &s;mell,</HI> Cant. ii. 12. What is all this but God's quickening grace, re&s;toring the believer to his ble&s;&s;ed joy. Oh! my bre|thren, I have not time to &s;how you in how many ways the Redeemer's grace is di&s;played; but wherever this grace is, what rea&s;on have you that are partakers of it, and I, to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y that it may be with us all; <HI>the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ays John here, <HI>be with you all:</HI> it is not &s;aid all mini&s;ters, it is not &s;aid all of this or that particular people, but with all be|lievers. O! my friends remember what Mr. Henry &s;aid, he de&s;ired to be a Catholic, but not a Roman Catholic. I have often thought &s;ince I went to &s;ee the water-works, that it was an emblem of Chri&s;t; there is a great re&s;ervoir of water from which this great city is &s;upplied; but how is it &s;upplied from that re&s;ervoir? why by hundreds and hundreds of pipes: but where does this water go, does it go only to the di&s;&s;enters or to the church peo|ple, only to this or that people? no, the pipes convey the water to all; and I remember when I &s;aw it, it put me in mind of the great re&s;er|voir
<PB N="11" REF="033217_0018_0FF66AD0CA853108">
of grace, that living water that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and the pipes are the ordinances by which his grace is conveyed to all believing &s;ouls, God grant we may be of that happy number. O what a mercy it is that Chri&s;t has &s;aid, <HI>I will be with you always even to the end of the world, M</HI>att. xxviii. 20. and therefore we mu&s;t look upon this prayer to be efficacious now, as it was the moment the words dropt from the apo&s;tle's pen. I believe the mo&s;t minute philo&s;ophers, and tho&s;e that have the greate&s;t &s;kill in a&s;tronomy, cannot perceive there has been any abatement in the heat of the &s;un &s;ince God fir&s;t commanded it to rule the day, then &s;urely, if my God can make a &s;un that for &s;o many thou&s;ands of years &s;hall irradi|ate, enlighten, and warm the world, without lo&s;|ing any of its light and heat, &s;o does the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the Son of God, ari&s;e upon the children of God with healing under his wings; he rai&s;es, warms, nouri&s;hes, and com|forts his people, and we have the go&s;pel on the ends of the earth, as well as tho&s;e who had the honor of conver&s;ing with him in the days of his fle&s;h. I mention this in an&s;wer to all tho&s;e who have wrote again&s;t the Methodi&s;ts, and repre&s;ented them as fanatics; there is no other way of talking again&s;t the divine influ|ence, but by allowing it was &s;o formerly, but that it is not &s;o now; they &s;ay the primitive Chri&s;tians had it, but it is not to be &s;o with us now as it was formerly. O my brethren, what fools the&s;e great men are when they talk a|bout things they know nothing of; give them
<PB N="12" REF="033217_0019_0FF68E8EF104FEF8">
a polygot, give them a lexicon, give them a geographical text, or the chronological part of the &s;cripture, they have &s;omething to &s;ay; but when they come to talk of the Spirit of God, they &s;ee the word Spirit, and they read the word grace, but while they read it their hearts cry, becau&s;e their knowledge puffs them up, &s;urely if it was &s;o, we great men that have been in the univer&s;ity &s;hould have it, God would give it us; and becau&s;e they find it not in them&s;elves, their abominable pride will not own it may be in any. Pray what was Peter, James, and John, I don't mean to &s;peak di&s;|re&s;pectfully of them, they were as weak, as blind, as ob&s;tinate, and worldly-minded as oth|ers, till Je&s;us Chri&s;t changed their hearts; and that &s;ame grace that changed their hearts, changes now the hearts of God's people; and ble&s;&s;ed be God, that &s;ame grace is with all his people.</P>
<P>It is &s;o in his ordinances. Here is the differ|ence between a Formali&s;t and a Chri&s;tian; the Formali&s;t goes to ordinances, but then he does not feel the God of ordinances, and that is the rea&s;on mo&s;t formal people don't care to go to church very often: who cares to go to the hou&s;e of a per&s;on he does not love? they will only ju&s;t knock at the door, and a&s;k if &s;uch a per&s;on is at home, and are very glad to hear the &s;ervants &s;ay their ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s is not at home; the vi&s;it is paid; &s;o it is with many people that go to church and meeting; and I do not doubt but there are many Metho|di&s;ts, hundreds and hundreds, that have been
<PB N="13" REF="033217_0020_0FF68E934CCE3E78">
at the ordinances, who never felt the God of ordinances converting them to this day.</P>
<P>The grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is with his people in prayer. Who can pray without grace? they may laugh at it as will, but God give you and I a &s;pirit of prayer; let them laugh as they plea&s;e; what profit will it be to us to read this book without the grace of God. What a horrid blunder has the bi&s;hop of G&mdash;r been guilty of? What do you think his lord|&s;hip &s;ays, in order to expo&s;e the fanatici&s;m of the Methodi&s;ts? Why, &s;ays he, they &s;ay they cannot under&s;tand the &s;criptures without the Spirit of God. Can any man under&s;tand the &s;criptures without the Spirit of God helps him? Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t open our under&s;tanding to under&s;tand the &s;criptures, and the Spirit of God mu&s;t take of the things of Chri&s;t and &s;how them unto us; as we are taught to pray, <HI>O Lord, thou ha&s;t cau&s;ed thy holy &s;criptures to be written,</HI> &amp;c. as in the &s;econd Sunday in Ad|vent; and here the b&mdash;p pretends to tell us, there is no need of it; here our collect and b&mdash;p di&s;agree very much. So with re&s;pect to all ordinances it is the &s;ame: what &s;ignifies my preaching, and your hearing, if the Spir|it of God does not enlighten? Formal min|i&s;ters can &s;teal a &s;ermon, and add a little out of their own heads, but a mini&s;ter of the go&s;|pel cannot preach to purpo&s;e without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God, no more than a &s;hip can &s;ail without wind. As for a carnal man he may take his &s;ermon in his pocket, and you will find his &s;ermons always the &s;ame;
<PB N="14" REF="033217_0021_0FF68E950859B5E8">
but &s;piritual preachers are &s;eldom &s;o; &s;ome|times they are in darkne&s;s, &s;o as to &s;peak to tho&s;e that are in darkne&s;s; &s;ometimes they are tempted, &s;o as to &s;peak to tho&s;e that are tempted; &s;ometimes they have a full gale, and go before the wind, and this is all by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God, and without this a man may preach like an angel, and do no good at all. So in re&s;pect of hearing the word of God, I declare I would not preach again, if I did not think that God would accompany the word by his Spirit: what are we but <HI>&s;ound|ing bra&s;s and tinkling cymbols?</HI> If the word is preached in the &s;trength of the Spirit, it will be attended with convictions, and conver&s;ions, and the grace of God will be both with preach|er and hearer.</P>
<P><HI>The grace of God</HI> is with his people in <HI>his Providence.</HI> O! &s;ays bi&s;hop Hall, a little aid is not enough for me. My going on the wa|ter puts me in mind of what I have &s;een ma|ny times: if the &s;ailors perceive a &s;torm a coming, they do not chu&s;e to &s;peak to the pa&s;|&s;engers for fear of frightening them, they will go quietly on deck, and give orders for proper care to be taken; and if a &s;ailor can tell of &s;torms approaching by the clouds, why can't God's people tell why God does &s;o and &s;o with them? The people of God eye him in his Providence; the very hairs of their heads are all numbered, and the grace of God is with them in the common bu&s;ine&s;s of life. Some people think that the Methodi&s;ts preach &s;o and &s;o to make them neglect their bu&s;ine&s;s, and
<PB N="15" REF="033217_0022_0FF68E971A5C98A0">
we preach at un&s;ea&s;onable times: we would not preach at this time, but that we are going to part from one another; no, we preach that the grace of God may attend them in their counting-hou&s;es, and woe be to tho&s;e per&s;ons that do not take the grace of God with them into their counting-hou&s;es, and in their com|mon bu&s;ine&s;s.

<Q><HI>God is our refuge and &s;trength, a very pre&s;ent help in trouble; therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, and the mountains be carried into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea, though the waters thereof roar, and be troubled, though the mountains &s;hake with the &s;welling thereof, Selah.

This is true of the 46th P&s;alm in particular, part of which I have ju&s;t now read to you, and which I pray the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God to apply to every one of our hearts. It is uncertain at what time, or upon what occa&s;ion, David wrote it; proba|bly under &s;ome &s;harp affliction, which made him eloquent; or when the affliction was o|ver, when his heart was &s;wimming with grati|tude and love, and when out of the fulne&s;s of it his pen was made <HI>the pen of a ready writer.</HI> It was a favorite P&s;alm with Luther; for whenever Melancthon, who was of a melan|choly turn, or any other of his friends, told him &s;ome &s;ad news, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, come, come, let us &s;ing the 46th P&s;alm; and when he had &s;ung that, his heart was quiet.

Ob|&s;erve the climax, <HI>God is our refuge,</HI> is one de|gree; <HI>God is our &s;trength,</HI> another; <HI>God is our help,</HI> and not only &s;o, but is a <HI>pre&s;ent help,</HI> yea, <HI>is a very pre&s;ent help,</HI> and at a time when we want it mo&s;t, <HI>in the time of trouble.</HI> It is here &s;uppo&s;ed, that all God's people will have their troubles, <HI>man is born to trouble, as the &s;parks fly upward;</HI> and if we are born to trouble as men, we are much more &s;o as chri&s;tians. We for|get our&s;elves and the &s;tation in which God has placed us, when we &s;o much as begin to dream of having much re&s;pite from trouble while we are here below.

But the day is over; God help us to take warning: and oh! with what gratitude &s;hould we approach him to night, for bearing with, and for for-bearing us &s;o long; let each &s;ay to night, why am I out of hell? how came I not to be damned, when I have made every thing el&s;e my God, my refuge, for &s;o many years?

<P>But, my brethren, the mo&s;t heavy ta&s;k of this night yet lies unperformed; indeed, if my friend&s;hip for the decea&s;ed did not lead me to it, I &s;hould pray to be excu&s;ed; my body is &s;o weak, my nerves &s;o un&s;trung, and the heat

God was then your refuge, and God will con|tinue to be your refuge. You are now God's peculiar care, and as a proof that you will make God your refuge, you have cho&s;en to make your fir&s;t appearance in the hou&s;e of God, in the Tabernacle, where I hope God delights to dwell, and where you met with God, and which I hope you will never leave till God removes you hence. Whatever trials may yet await you, remember you are now become God's peculiar care. You had before a hu&s;band to plead for you; he is gone, but your pleader is not dead, he lives, and will plead your cau&s;e; may you find him better to you than ten thou&s;and hu&s;bands; may he make up the awful cha&s;m that death has made, and may the Lord God be your refuge in time, and your portion to all eternity; and then you will have a ble&s;&s;ed change.

The poor have indeed lo&s;t a friend; and I believe there has not been a man, a trade&s;man in London, for the&s;e many years, that has been more lamented than the dear man who now, I hope, is at re&s;t. You well know how mindful he has been of you, and that &s;oon after the decea&s;e of his di&s;con&s;o|late widow, his &s;ub&s;tance will be divided a|mong &s;ome of you. Give me leave to charge

Do not &s;ay, Mr. Beckman my uncle is dead, come pluck up, let us plague her now &s;he is living, we &s;hall have all when &s;he is dead. The plague of God will follow you if you do: if you valued your dear uncle, do all you can to make her life ea&s;y; pay her that re&s;pect which you would pay the decea&s;ed was he now living; this will &s;hew your love is genuine, and not counterfeit, and do not <HI>lay up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath.</HI> Follow the example of your dear decea&s;ed uncle; the gentleman was vi&s;ible in him as well as the chri&s;tian; he would be in his warehou&s;e early in the morn|ing, that he might come &s;oon to his country-hou&s;e, and there employ him&s;elf in his friend|ly life, and open the door to the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>3 Epi&s;tle JOHN ii.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Beloved, I wi&s;h above all things that thou may&s;t pro&s;per, and be in health, even as thy &s;oul pro&s;pereth.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT a horrid blunder has one of the famous, or rather infamous, dei&s;tical writers made, when he &s;ays, that the go&s;pel cannot be of God, becau&s;e there is no &s;uch thing as friend&s;hip mentioned in it. Surely if he ever read the go&s;pel, <HI>having eyes he &s;aw not, having ears he heard not:</HI> but I believe the chief rea&s;on is, his heart being waxen gro&s;s, he could not under&s;tand; for this is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that the world never yet &s;aw &s;uch a &s;pecimen of &s;teady and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, as was di&s;played in the life, exam|ple, and conduct of Je&s;us Chri&s;t of Nazareth.</P>
<P>John, the writer of this epi&s;tle, had the honor of leaning on his bo&s;om, and of being called, by way of empha&s;is, <HI>the di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved;</HI> and that very di&s;ciple, which is
<PB N="44" REF="033217_0051_0FF68EDDC7110178">
very remarkable concerning him, though he was one of tho&s;e whom the Lord him&s;elf named Sons of Thunder, <HI>Mark</HI> iv. 17. and was &s;o &s;uddenly, as bi&s;hop Hall ob&s;erves, turn|ed into a &s;on of lightning, that he would have called down fire from heaven to con&s;ume his ma&s;ter's enemies; con&s;equently, though he was of a natural fiery temper, yet the change in his heart was &s;o remarkable, that if a judg|ment may be formed by his writings, he &s;eems as full of love, if not fuller, than any of his fellow apo&s;tles. He learned pity and benevo|lence of the father of mercies; and to &s;how how chri&s;tian friend&s;hip is to be cultivated, he not only wrote letters to churches in general, even to tho&s;e he never &s;aw in the fle&s;h, but private letters to particular &s;aints, friends to whom he was attached, and wealthy rich friends, whom God had, by his Spirit, rai&s;ed up to be helpers of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Happy would it be for us, if we could all learn that &s;implicity of heart which is di&s;played in the&s;e particular words; happy if we could learn this one rule, never to write a letter without &s;ome|thing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in it; for, as Mr. Henry ob&s;erves, if we are to an&s;wer for idle words, much more for idle letters; and if God has given us our pens, e&s;pecially if he has given us <HI>the pen of a ready writer,</HI> it will be happy if we can improve our literary corre&s;pondence for his glory and one another's good. But what an unfa&s;hionable &s;tile, if compared to our modern ones, is that of the apo&s;tle to Gaius. The &s;uper&s;cription <HI>from the elder to
<PB N="45" REF="033217_0052_0FF68EE08D9F9068">
the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth;</HI> there is fine language for you! Many who call them&s;elves Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, would be a&s;hamed to write &s;o now. <HI>I &s;end this, and that, and the other; I &s;end my compliments.</HI> Ob&s;erve what he &s;tiles him&s;elf, not as the pope;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whether Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop, or Vicar of Chri&s;t, Supreme Head&punc; Lord or Governor of the World, or a more pla&s;phemous title, is un|certain; the writer not hearing di&s;tinctly the Latin words in which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> but he &s;tiles him&s;elf the elder. A ju|dicious expo&s;itor is of opinion, that all the other apo&s;tles were dead, and only poor John left behind. I remember a remark of his, "the taller we grow, the lower we &s;hall &s;toop." The apo&s;tle puts him&s;elf upon a level with the common elders of a church, that he might not &s;eem to take &s;tare upon him, not to rule as a lion, but with a rod of love: <HI>the elder to the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</HI> This Gaius &s;eems to be in our mo|dern language, what we call a gentleman, particularly remarkable for his ho&s;pitality, <HI>Gaius mine ho&s;t;</HI> and this Gaius was well-be|loved, not only beloved, but well-beloved; that is, one who I greatly e&s;teem and am fond of; but then he &s;hows likewi&s;e upon what this fondne&s;s is founded, <HI>whom I love in the truth.</HI> There are a great many people in writ|ing &s;ay, <HI>dear &s;ir,</HI> or <HI>good &s;ir,</HI> and &s;ub&s;cribe <HI>your humble &s;ervant, &s;ir;</HI> and not one word of truth either in the beginning or end; but John and Gaius's love was in truth, not only in words, <HI>but in deed and in truth;</HI> as if he had &s;aid, my heart goes along with my hand while I am
<PB N="46" REF="033217_0053_0FF68EE245CDB3D8">
writing, and it gives me plea&s;ure in &s;uch a cor|re&s;pondence as this, or <HI>whom I love for the truth's &s;ake,</HI> that is, whom I love for being par|ticularly attached to the truth; and then our friend&s;hip has a proper foundation, when the Love of God and the Spirit of the Lord Je&s;us, is the ba&s;is and bond of it. One would think this was enough now; the epi&s;tles originally were not divided into ver&s;es as now that peo|ple may the better find out particular places, though perhaps not altogether &s;o properly as they might. The apo&s;tle's &s;aying <HI>beloved</HI> is not needle&s;s tautology, but proves the &s;trength of his affection; <HI>I wi&s;h that thou may&s;t pro&s;per, and be in health, even as thy &s;oul pro&s;pereth.</HI> Gaius, it &s;eems, at this time felt a weak con|&s;titution, or a bad habit of body; this may &s;how, that the mo&s;t u&s;eful per&s;ons, the choice&s;t favourites of heaven, mu&s;t not expect to be without the common infirmities of the human frame; &s;o far from this, that it is often found that a thou&s;and u&s;eful Chri&s;tians have weakly con&s;titutions. That great and &s;weet &s;inger of I&s;rael, Dr. Watts, I remember about two and thirty years ago told me that he had got no &s;leep for three months, but what was procured by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite art of the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians; and, my dear hearers, none but tho&s;e that have &s;uch habits of body can &s;ym|pathize with tho&s;e that are under them. When we are in high &s;pirits we think people might do if they would, but when brought down our&s;elves we cannot; but notwith&s;tand|ing his body was in this condition, his &s;oul
<PB N="47" REF="033217_0054_0FF68EE49C063D78">
pro&s;pered &s;o eminently, &s;o very eminently, that the apo&s;tle could not think it a greater mercy, or the church a greater ble&s;&s;ing, than that this bodily health might be as vigorous as the health of his &s;oul. I remember the great co|lonel Gardiner, who had the honor of being killed in his country's cau&s;e, clo&s;es one of his la&s;t letters to me, with wi&s;hing I might enjoy a thriving &s;oul in a healthy body; but this is peculiar to the followers of Je&s;us, they find the &s;oul pro&s;pers mo&s;t when the body is wor&s;t; and ob&s;erve, he wi&s;hes him a pro&s;pering body above all things, that he might have joy and health with a pro&s;perous &s;oul; for if we have a good heart, and good health at the &s;ame time, and our hearts are alive to God, we go on with a fre&s;h gale. I ob&s;erve, that the &s;oul of man in general mu&s;t be made a partaker of a divine life before it can be &s;aid to pro&s;per at all. The words of our text are particularly applicable to a renewed heart, to one that is really alive to God. When a tree is dead we don't &s;o much as expect leaves from it, nor to &s;ee any beauty at all in a plant or flower that we know is ab&s;olutely dead; and therefore the foundation of the apo&s;tle's wi&s;h lies here, that the &s;oul of Gaius, and con&s;equently the &s;ouls of all true believers, have life communicated to them from the Spirit of the living God. Such a life may God of his infinite mercy im|part to each of us! and I think, if I am not mi&s;taken, and I believe I may venture to &s;ay that I am not, that where the divine life is implanted by the Spirit of the living God, that
<PB N="48" REF="033217_0055_0FF68EE66DCA7538">
life admits of decrea&s;e and increa&s;e, admits of dreadful decays, and al&s;o of &s;ome ble&s;&s;ed reviv|ings. The rays of the divine life being once implanted, it will grow up to eternal life; the new creation is ju&s;t like the old when God &s;aid <HI>let there be light, &amp; there was light,</HI> which never cea&s;ed &s;ince the univer&s;e was made, and the favourite creature man was born. Upon a &s;urvey of his own works, God pronounced <HI>every thing good, and entered into his re&s;t;</HI> &s;o it will be with all tho&s;e who are made partak|ers of the divine nature. <HI>The water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall be a well of water &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting life.</HI></P>
<P>My brethren, from our fir&s;t coming into the world, till our pa&s;&s;ing out of it to <HI>the &s;pir|its of ju&s;t men made perfect,</HI> all the Lord's Children have found, &s;ome more, and others le&s;s, that they have had dreadful as well as ble&s;&s;ed times, and all has been over-ruled to bring them nearer unto God: but I believe, I am &s;ure, I &s;peak to &s;ome this night, that if it was put to their choice, had rather know that their &s;ouls pro&s;pered, than to have ten thou|&s;and pounds left them: and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that we may not only know it our&s;elves, but that others may know it, <HI>that their profiting,</HI> as Paul &s;ays, <HI>may appear to all.</HI> Becau&s;e John &s;ays, <HI>I wi&s;h above all things, that thy body may be in health, as thy &s;oul pro&s;pers.</HI> O may all that conver&s;e with us &s;ee it in us!

and be contented that we were converted twenty or thirty years ago, &amp; learn, as &s;ome Antinomians, <HI>to live by faith.</HI> Thank God, &s;ay &s;ome, we met with God &s;o many months ago, but are not at all &s;olicitous whe|ther they meet with him any more; &amp; there is not a &s;ingle individual here that is &s;avingly acquainted with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but wi&s;hes his &s;oul pro&s;pered more than his body.</P>
<P>The great que&s;tion is, how &s;hall I know that my &s;oul pro&s;pers? I have been told that there is &s;uch a thing as knowing this, and that I can be con&s;cious of it my&s;elf, and others too. It may not be mi&s;pending an hour, to lay down &s;ome marks whereby we may know whether our &s;ouls pro&s;per or no. If there be any of you of an Antinomian turn of mind, (I don't know there are any of you) I don't know but you will be of the &s;ame mind of the man that came to me in Leadenhall twenty-five years a|go: Sir, &s;ays he, you preached upon the marks of the new birth. Marks, &s;ays I, yes, &s;ir: O thank God, &s;ays he, I am above marks, I don't mind marks at all: and you may be a&s;&s;ured per&s;ons are upon the brink of Anti|nomiani&s;m, that &s;ay away with your legal preaching. I wonder they don't &s;ay as they go along the &s;treets, away with your dials, a|way with your dials, we don't want marks, we know what it is o'clock without any. If the marks upon the &s;oul of a believer are like the &s;un-dial, there are marks to prove that we are upon the right foundation: if the &s;un does not &s;hine on the &s;un-dial, there is no knowing
<PB N="50" REF="033217_0057_0FF68EEB2A755AB0">
what o'clock it is: but let it &s;hine, and in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly you know the time of the day; this is not known when it is cloudy; and who dare to &s;ay but that a child of God, for want of the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hining upon his heart, may write bitter things again&s;t him&s;elf. A good man may have the vapours, as one Mr. Brown had, that wrote a book of good hymns, who was &s;o vapouri&s;h, that no body could make him believe he had a &s;oul at all.

I don't mean the Tabernacle comers, or the Foundery comers, or the church, or di&s;&s;enters, but I &s;peak to all of you, of whatever denomination you are; God of his infinite mercy give you his Spirit. You that are believers, come, let us have that common name among us all; if we have got it, we go off well.

five or &s;ix-and twenty editions; and yet I think if he was now alive, and to preach once or twice a day, they would cry, Away with his commentary, and preaching and all) &s;peaks to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. <HI>Come into the world &s;till-born!</HI> what language is that in a preacher's mouth? but it will do for tho&s;e that like to u&s;e marks and &s;igns. <HI>I will pour out a Spirit of grace and &s;upplication,</HI> &s;ays the Lord; and I will venture to &s;ay, if the Spirit of grace re|&s;ides in the heart, the Spirit of &s;upplication will not be wanting. Per&s;ons under their fir&s;t love dare not go without God; they go to God, not as the formali&s;t does, not for fear of going to hell, or being damned. It is a mercy any thing drives to prayer; and a per&s;on under the &s;pirit of bondage, that has been ju&s;t brought to the liberty of the &s;ons of God, goes freely to his heavenly father, under the di&s;coveries and con&s;traints of divine love. Come I will appeal to your&s;elves; did not you, like a dear fond mother, if the child, the beloved child, made but the lea&s;t noi&s;e in the world, O, &s;ays the mother, the dear child cries, I mu&s;t go and hu&s;h it: &s;o time was, when many hearkened to the call of God, and could no more keep from the pre&s;ence of God in &s;ecret, than a fond mother from the pre&s;ence of her dear child. Now if your &s;ouls do pro&s;per, this con|nection between you and God will be kept up; I do not &s;ay that you will always have the &s;ame fervour as when you fir&s;t &s;et out; I do not &s;ay you will always be carried up into the third heavens; the animal &s;pirits po&s;&s;ibly will

not admit of &s;uch &s;olace; but you &s;hould en|quire with your&s;elves, whether you would be ea&s;y to be out of God's company? Steal from behind your counter, and go and conver&s;e with God. Sir Thomas Abney, who was ob|&s;ervable for keeping up con&s;tant prayer in his family, being a&s;ked how he kept up prayer that night he was &s;worn in Lord Mayor? Very well, &s;ays he, I got the company into my room, and entertained them, and when the time came, I told them I mu&s;t leave them a little, while I went and prayed with my fam|ily, and returned again. God grant we may have many &s;uch Lord-Mayers. If our &s;ouls pro&s;per, the &s;ame principle will reign in us, and make us con&s;cientiou&s;ly attend on the means of grace. It is a mo&s;t dreadful mark of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic turn of mind, when per&s;ons think they are &s;o high in grace, that they thank God they have no need of ordinances. Our being the children of God, is &s;o far from being the cau&s;e of our wanting no ordinances, that, properly &s;peaking, the ordinances are intended for the nouri&s;hing of the children of God; not only for the awaking the &s;oul at fir&s;t, but for the feeding of the &s;oul afterwards. If the &s;ame nouri&s;hment the child receives before, feeds it after it is born; and as the manna never fail|ed, but the children of I&s;rael partook of it daily while in the wilderne&s;s, till they came to Ca|naan, &s;o we &s;hall want our daily bread, we &s;hall want the God of grace and mercy to convey his divine life into our hearts, till we get into the heavenly Canaan. There faith will be
<PB N="53" REF="033217_0060_0FF68EF29B48E8B8">
turned into vi&s;ion, and then we &s;hall not want ordinances; and let people &s;ay what they will, if our &s;ouls pro&s;per we &s;hall be glad of ordi|nances, we &s;hall love the place where God dwells; we &s;hall not &s;ay, <HI>&s;uch a one preaches and I will not go,</HI> but if we are among them we &s;hall be glad of a good plain country di&s;h, as well as a fine garni&s;hed de&s;ert; and if our &s;ouls pro&s;per, we &s;hall be fond of the me&s;&s;en|gers as well as the me&s;&s;age: we &s;hall admire as much to hear a good ram's-horn, &s;uch as blowed down the walls of Jericho, as a fine &s;ilver trumpet. So in all the ordinances of the Lord, that of the Lord's-&s;upper for ex|ample; if the &s;oul does not attend thereon, it is an evidence that it does not pro&s;per. It is a wonder if that &s;oul has not done &s;omething to make it afraid to meet God at his table. <HI>Adam, where art thou?</HI> &s;ays the eternal Lo|gos to his fallen creature; and every time we mi&s;s, whether we think of it or no, the Re|deemer puts it down; but if our &s;ouls pro&s;|per, how &s;hall we run to the table of the Lord, and be glad to come often to the com|memoration of his death.</P>
<P>I will venture to affirm farther, that if your &s;ouls pro&s;per, you will grow downwards. What is that? why you will grow in the knowledge of your&s;elves. I heard, when I was at Li&s;bon, that &s;ome people there began at the top of the hou&s;e fir&s;t. It is odd kind of preaching that will do for the Papi&s;ts, re&s;t|ing merely in externals.

let me know my&s;elf,</HI> was a prayer that one of the Fathers put up for &s;ixteen years together; and if you have high thoughts of your&s;elves, you may know you are light-headed, you forget what poor &s;illy creatures you are. As our &s;ouls pro&s;per we &s;hall be more and more &s;en&s;i|ble, not only of the out&s;ide, but of the in&s;ide; we fir&s;t battle with the outward man, but as we advance in the divine life, we have nearer views of the chambers of imagery that are in our hearts; and one day after another we &s;hall find more and more abomination there, and con&s;equently we &s;hall &s;ee more of the glo|ry of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the wonders of that Im|manuel, who daily delivers us from this body of &s;in and death; and I mention this, becau&s;e there is nothing more common, e&s;pecially with young Chri&s;tians. I u&s;ed formerly to have at lea&s;t a hundred or two hundred in a day, who would come and &s;ay, O dear, I am &s;o and &s;o, I met with God; ah! that is quite well: a week after they would come and &s;ay, O, &s;ir, it is all delu&s;ion, there was nothing in it; what is the matter? O never was &s;uch a wretch as I am, I never thought I had &s;uch a wicked heart. Oh! God cannot love me; now, &s;ir, all my fervour, and all that I felt is gone; and what then? does a tree never grow but when it grows upward? &s;ome trees I fancy grow downward; and the deeper you grow in the knowledge of your&s;elf, the deeper you grow in the knowledge of God and his grace, that di&s;covers the corruptions of your hearts. Do not you find that aged men look

back upon &s;ome former &s;tates. I know &s;ome people can't look back to &s;ee how many &s;ins they have been guilty of, but if grace helps us to a &s;ight of our inherent corruptions, it will make us weary of it, and lead us to the blood of Chri&s;t to clean&s;e us from it; con&s;e|quently, if your &s;ouls pro&s;per, the more you will fall in love with the glorious Redemer, and with his righteou&s;ne&s;s. I never knew a per&s;on in my life that diligently u&s;ed the word, and other means, but as they improved in grace, &s;aw more and more of the nece&s;&s;ity of depending upon a better righteou&s;ne&s;s than their own. Generally when we fir&s;t &s;et out, we have got better hearts than heads; but if we grow in the divine life, our heads will grow as well as our hearts, and the Spirit of God leads out of abominable &s;elf, and cau&s;es us to flee more and more to that glorious and com|plete righteou&s;ne&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t wrought out.</P>
<P>The more your &s;ouls pro&s;per, the more you will &s;ee of the freene&s;s and di&s;tingui&s;hing na|ture of God's grace, that all is of grace. We are all naturally free-willers, and generally young ones &s;ay, O we have found the Me&s;&s;iah, of whom Mo&s;es and the Prophets &s;poke; which is right, except that word <HI>we</HI> have found; for the believer a little after learns, that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> had found him. I mention this, becau&s;e we ought not to make per&s;ons offenders for a word; we &s;hould bear with young Chri&s;tians, and not knock a young

<P>Let it not be forgotten al&s;o, that the more your &s;ouls pro&s;per, the more you will get a|bove the world. You cannot think that I mean you &s;hould be negligent about the things of this life. Nothing tries my temper more, than to &s;ee any about me idle; an idle per&s;on tempts the devil to tempt him. In the &s;tate of paradi&s;e Adam and Eve were to dre&s;s the garden, and not to be idle there; after the fall they were to till the ground: but if any body &s;ays that the Methodi&s;ts think to be idle, they injure them. We tell people to ri&s;e and be at their work early and late, that they may redeem time to attend the word. If all that &s;peak again&s;t the Methodi&s;ts were as diligent, it would be better for their wives and families. What do you think a true Metho|di&s;t will be idle? no, he will be bu&s;y with his hands, he knows time is precious, and there|fore he will work hard that he may have to give to them that need, and at the &s;ame time he will live above the world; and you know the earth is under your feet, &s;o is the world. When he goes to &s;leep he will &s;ay, I care not whether I awake more. I can look back, and tell you of hundreds and hundreds that once &s;eemed alive to God, and have been drawn a|way with a little filthy, na&s;ty dirt. How ma|ny places are there empty here, that have been filled with per&s;ons that once were zealous in their attendance? As a per&s;on the other day, to who&s;e having a place it was objected, that

he was a Methodi&s;t; no, &s;ays he, I have not been a Methodi&s;t the&s;e two years. I do not, for my part, wi&s;h people joy when they get money; only take care it does not get into, and put your eyes out; if your money increa&s;|es, let your zeal for good works increa&s;e. Per|haps &s;ome &s;tranger will &s;ay, I thought you was again&s;t good works. I tell you the truth, I am again&s;t good works, don't run away before I have fini&s;hed my &s;entence; we are again&s;t good works being put in the room of Chri&s;t, as the ground of our, acceptance; but we look upon it, if we have a right faith, our faith will work by love. Ever &s;ince I was a boy, I remember to have heard a &s;tory of a poor indigent beggar, who a&s;ked a clergyman to give him his alms, which being refu&s;ed, he &s;aid, will you plea&s;e, &s;ir, to give me your ble&s;|&s;ing; &s;ays he, God ble&s;s you: O, replied the beggar, you would not give me that if it was worth any thing. There are many who will talk very friendly to you, but if they &s;uppo&s;e you are come for any thing, they will run a|way as from a pick-pocket; whereas, if our &s;ouls pro&s;pered, we &s;hould <HI>count it more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive.</HI> When we ri&s;e from our beds this would be our que&s;tion to our&s;elves, what can I do for God to-day? what can I do for the poor? have I two, or five, or ten talents? God help me to do for the poor as much as if I knew I was to live only this day.</P>
<P>In a word, if your &s;ouls pro&s;per, my dear hearers, you will grow in love. There are &s;ome good &s;ouls, but very narrow &s;ouls; they

are &s;o afraid of loving people that differ from them, that it makes me unea&s;y to &s;ee it. Par|ty &s;pirits creep in among Chri&s;tians, &amp; whereas it was formerly &s;aid, <HI>&s;ee how the&s;e Chri&s;tians love one another!</HI> now it may be &s;aid, <HI>&s;ee how the&s;e Chri&s;tians hate one another!</HI> I declare from the bottom of my heart, that I am more and more convinced that the principles I have preached are the word of God. Pray what do you do at Change; is there &s;uch a thing as a Pre&s;byterian, or Independent, or Church-walk there? is there any chambers there for the Pre&s;byterians, and Independents, and Church|men to deal in? People may boa&s;t of their wildfire-zeal for God, till they can't bear the &s;ight of a per&s;on that differs from them. The apo&s;tle commends Gaius for his catholic love, for his love to &s;trangers. That was a glorious &s;aying of a good woman in Scotland, <HI>Come in,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>ye ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord;</HI> I have a hou&s;e that will hold a hundred, and a heart that will hold ten thou&s;and. God give us &s;uch a heart; <HI>he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God.</HI> I could mention twenty marks, and &s;o go on wire-drawing till nine or ten o'clock; but it is be&s;t to deal with our &s;ouls as with our bo|dies, to eat but little at a time. It is &s;o with preaching; though I don't proceed any far|ther in my di&s;cour&s;e, God ble&s;s what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>But is there a child of God here that can go away without a drooping heart? I don't &s;peak that you may think me humble: I love &s;incerity, inward and outward, and hate guile.

When I think what God has done for me, how often he has pruned me, and dug and dung'd about me, and when I think how lit|tle I have done for God, it makes me weep if po&s;&s;ible tears of blood; it makes me cry <HI>O my leanne&s;s, my leanne&s;s,</HI> as I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with my friend to day.

The office of a prie&s;t is this: he is not to confine him&s;elf to his place, no; what then? why he is <HI>to go forth, and &s;eek after the chil|dren of God that are di&s;per&s;ed in this naughty world;</HI> the&s;e are the very words that the bi&s;h|op &s;peaks to us when we are ordained; but if we are confined to one particular place, and are to be &s;hut up in one corner, pray how do we &s;eek the children of God that are di&s;per&s;ed in this naughty world? Pari&s;hes and &s;ettled mini&s;ters there mu&s;t be, but we are not, I in|&s;i&s;t on it, to be hindered from preaching Chri&s;t any where, becau&s;e he bids us <HI>go into all the world;</HI> here is our licence.

world:</HI> there is the licence, and the Spirit of Chri&s;t helping us to preach by that licence, will make all the devil's children cowards be|fore us. We have tried them the&s;e thirty years, would to God we &s;et about it now; if I had &s;trength I would &s;et about it to-mor|row; I only grieve that my body will not hold out for field-preaching, el&s;e Kennington-Common &s;hould be my pulpit, for any place is con&s;ecrated where Chri&s;t is pre&s;ent. Well, what mu&s;t we go forth to do? <HI>Go ye into all the world, and preach;</HI> preach! what is that? why the original word for preach is to &s;peak out, as a crier does that cries goods that are lo&s;t; proclaim it. And I&s;aiah would be rec|koned a dreadful enthu&s;ia&s;t if now alive. How does he preach? he preaches in the King's chapels &s;uch language and eloquence as would carry all before it; and yet how does he preach? <HI>Ho, every one that thir&s;teth.</HI> O, <HI>he lifts up his voice like a trumpet.</HI> And the word preach &s;ignifies to proclaim; <HI>to cry aloud, and &s;pare not.</HI> How do you like one that cries your lo&s;t goods if he only whi&s;pers? would you chu&s;e to employ a man that you could not hear two yards? O, &s;ay, you, I &s;hall never find my goods: and if per&s;ons have what qualifi|cations they may, if they cannot be heard at all; they need not preach at all. I know a prebend in the cathedral of York, who &s;poke &s;o very low nobody heard him; &s;omebody &s;aid, they never heard &s;uch a <HI>moving</HI> &s;ermon in all their lives in that cathedral, for it made all the people <HI>move out,</HI> becau&s;e they could

not hear. The matter of the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel is of infinite importance: unle&s;s, my brethren, we could be heard, what do we preach for? It implies earne&s;tne&s;s in the preaching, and the preacher. You expect a per&s;on, like one that is crying your goods, to be in earne&s;t; and if we preach, and make the King's proclamation, we &s;hould be in earne&s;t. It is &s;aid, <HI>Chri&s;t opened his mouth and taught.</HI> Now a modern critic would laugh at&punc; that; o|pen his mouth, &s;ay they, how could he &s;peak without opening his mouth? Would it not be better to &s;ay, <HI>he taught them?</HI> No, no, there is no idle word in God's book. It is &s;aid, <HI>the Lord Je&s;us opened his mouth:</HI> what for? why, to get in breath that he might &s;peak loud to the people, when the heavens were his &s;ound|ing board; then did he open his mouth, and taught them in earne&s;t, powerfully; and there|fore the people make this ob&s;ervation when he had done &s;peaking, <HI>that he &s;poke as one having authority, and not as the Scribes.</HI> There is no di&s;pen&s;ation from preaching, but &s;ickne&s;s or want of abilities, to tho&s;e that are ordained to preach; and therefore it was a proverb in the primitive church, <HI>that it becomes a bi&s;hop to die preaching.</HI> Bi&s;hop Jewell, that ble&s;&s;ed mini&s;|ter of the church of England, gave that an|&s;wer to a per&s;on that met his lord&s;hip walking on foot in the dirt, going to preach to a few people. Why does your lord&s;hip, weak as you are, expo&s;e your&s;elf thus? &s;ays he, it be|comes a bi&s;hop to die preaching. Lord &s;end all the world that have bi&s;hops &s;uch jewels as

What are they to preach? why they are to preach not morality: not morali|ty! come, don't be frightened, any of you that are afraid of good works don't be fright|ened this morning: I &s;ay not morality; that is, morality is not to be the grand point of their preaching; they are not to preach as a heathen philo&s;opher would. A late bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who has not been dead a long while, &s;aid to his chaplain, You are not a mini&s;ter of Cicero, or any of the heathen philo&s;ophers; you are not to entertain your people with dry morality, but remember you are a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; you are, therefore, to preach the go&s;|pel; and if you will not preach the go&s;pel in the church, you mu&s;t not be angry for the poor people's going out into the fields where they hear the go&s;pel; that is to be your grand theme, <HI>Go into all the world and preach the go&s;|pel.</HI></P>
<P>Now the go&s;pel &s;ignifies good news, glad tidings: <HI>Behold I bring you,</HI> &s;aid the angel, <HI>glad tidings of great joy.</HI> Mean and contemp|tible as the office of a preacher may be thought now, the angels were glad of the commi&s;&s;ion to preach this go&s;pel: and Dr. Goodwin, that learned pious &s;oul, &s;ays in his familiar way, and that is the be&s;t way of writ|ing, God had but one Son, and he made a mini&s;ter of him; and I add, he made an itin|erant mini&s;ter of him too.

law; for you &s;hall find by and by, we are to preach &s;omething that the people mu&s;t be &s;aved by: it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell them how they are to be &s;aved, unle&s;s we tell them what they are to be &s;aved from. The way the Spirit of God takes, is like that we take in preparing the ground: do you think any farmer would have a crop of corn next year unle&s;s they plough now; and you may as well expect a crop of corn on unploughed ground, as a crop of grace, until the &s;oul is convinced of its being undone without a Saviour. That is the rea|&s;on we have &s;o many mu&s;hroom converts, &s;o many per&s;ons that are always happy! happy! happy! and never were mi&s;erable; why? becau&s;e their &s;tony ground is not ploughed up; they have not got a conviction of the law; they are &s;tony ground hearers: <HI>they hear the word with joy, and in a time of temptation,</HI> which will &s;oon come after a &s;eeming or real conver|&s;ion, <HI>they fall away.</HI> They &s;erve Chri&s;t as the young man &s;erved the Jews that laid hold of him, who, when he found he was like to be a pri&s;oner for following Chri&s;t, left his garments; and &s;o &s;ome people leave their profe&s;&s;ion. That makes me &s;o cautious now, which I was not thirty years ago, of dubbing people con|verts &s;o &s;oon. I love now to wait a little, and &s;ee if people bring forth fruit; for there are &s;o many blo&s;&s;oms which March winds you know blow away, that I cannot believe they are con|verts till I &s;ee fruit brought forth.

I don't think the pri&s;oners would be angry with us if we were to tell them, the king commi&s;&s;ions us to declare to them that they might come out of their pri&s;on, that their chains may be knocked off. If you was to go to one of them and &s;ay, Here you have your chains; and he was to &s;ay, I have no chains on at all, you would think that man's brains turned; and &s;o are every man's that does not &s;ee him&s;elf to be in the chains of &s;in and deceit.

<P>But, pray, if we are to preach, what are the creatures to do that &s;ee the need of this &s;al|vation? I will tell you; they are to believe. <HI>He that believeth, and is baptized,</HI> &amp;c.

Without faith we cannot be ju&s;|tified, either in our per&s;ons or performances; and therefore the Holy Gho&s;t has variou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed it, to let us &s;ee the importance of the point. It is expre&s;&s;ed by a coming, tru&s;t|ing, receiving, and relying, (all which amounts to the &s;ame thing) under a felt conviction that we are lo&s;t, undone, condemned without him: for, as a good old Puritan ob&s;erves, Chri&s;t is beholden to none of us for our hearts; we never &s;hould come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;inner's la&s;t &s;hift, till we feel we cannot do without him.

You don't like fawning people that come into your room, and by their very manner of coming prove they are not &s;incere; but a poor crea|ture that comes to pour out two or three words you &s;ee is hone&s;t, you will not &s;ay to &s;uch a one, Why do you come to me, &amp; not &s;peak blank ver&s;e? why do you come to me, and not &s;peak fine language?

<P>This is, my dear hearers, a pre&s;ent &s;alvation.

There are a great many good &s;ouls, that at times may doubt of the reality of this work upon their &s;ouls: a relaxed habit of bo|dy, a nervous di&s;order, you may &s;ay what you plea&s;e, will make a weak child of God doubt of what God has done in them, and that hurts the mind as it has &s;uch a clo&s;e connection with the body; but then a believer is low: God's people are low per&s;ons: as the greate&s;t geni|u&s;es are mo&s;t liable to lowne&s;s of &s;pirit, for the &s;cabbard is not &s;trong enough for the &s;word, and per&s;ons that talk much mu&s;t wear out in time; but this I &s;tand to, it is our priv|ilege to live above the fears of death. We do not live up to our dignity till every day we are waiting for the coming of our Lord from heaven; and I am per&s;uaded of this, though I believe there may be &s;ome exceptions, that the rea&s;on why we do not live more above the fear of death is, becau&s;e we keep in &s;o much with the&s;e na&s;ty earthly things&punc; You

And how can people have much of God or heaven, when they have &s;o much of the earth in their hearts? It is our privilege to live above the fear of death, though we are not to be &s;aved from dy|ing; and I am &s;ure a believer would not be &s;aved from dying for a million of worlds; it would be death to him not to die; but a &s;oul touched with the love of God, even in &s;ick|ne&s;s, in the mid&s;t of a burning fever, in the mid&s;t of a fire that will burn a thou&s;and bo|dies up, convul&s;ed with tortures and pains in every limb; a believer is enabled &s;ometimes to &s;ay, <HI>O my God, O my God, thou art love; I am ready to come to thee in the mid&s;t of all.</HI> Ble&s;|&s;ed be God, I need not go far for example; yonder, under the gallery, lies the remains, the carca&s;e of a dear &s;aint, who was for twenty-five days together, burned with a fever, enough to &s;corch any creature up; yet, one filled with love and power divine, ble&s;&s;ed the Lord Je|&s;us; though &s;he cried out, If I was not &s;up|ported, the agony of my body would make me impatient; yet never &s;aid a murmuring word, but in the mid&s;t of all cried out to tho&s;e about her, <HI>God is love! O my joys! O the com|fors that I feel!</HI> and in her very la&s;t moments cried out, <HI>I am a coming; dear Lord, I am a coming;</HI> and &s;o &s;weetly &s;lept in Je&s;us. If this

The&s;e are dying and yet living witne&s;&s;es that <HI>God is love!</HI> She was in raptures when Mr. Sheppard went to vi&s;it her: &s;he de&s;ired me to tell you, that <HI>God is love:</HI> de&s;ired me to tell you in the Chapel pul|pit, that &s;he was called about four years ago. I think Mr. Lee was the in&s;trument of her conver&s;ion. Now her body is to be put to bed at noon; but her &s;oul is crying, O the joys! the joys! the joys! of being &s;aved by a ble&s;&s;ed Emanuel! Now will any one dare to deny this evidence? Do you &s;ee worldly people work them&s;elves up into that frame when they die? Vi&s;it them when they are near death: ah dear! they are in the vapours; they are &s;o afraid of dying, that the doctor will not &s;uffer us to come near them; no, not common clergymen, for fear we &s;hould damp their &s;pirits: till they find they are ju&s;t gone, and then they give us leave to &s;ay the farewel prayer to them: but they that are born from above, that are made new creatures in Chri&s;t, feel &s;omething that &s;miles upon them in death. She told them, <HI>&s;he believed God would let her go over Jordan dry &s;hod;</HI> that was her ex|pre&s;&s;ion. If this is &s;alvation on earth, what mu&s;t it be in heaven? If in the mid&s;t of the tortures of a burning fever a raptured &s;oul can cry, O the joys! O the comforts! Lord, I am coming!

Well, thank God you have the promi&s;e; but with the promi&s;e, learn to walk by that <HI>faith which is the evidence of things not &s;een,</HI> which brings God down, brings heaven near, and gives the &s;oul a heart-felt experience, that <HI>God is love.</HI> Here is a &s;alvation worthy of a God! here is a &s;alvation worthy of the Mediator's blood! for this he groaned, for this he bled, for this he died, for this he aro&s;e, for this he a&s;cended, for this he &s;ent the Holy Gho&s;t, and for this purpo&s;e he now &s;ends him into the hearts of his people.

<P>WHAT a pity it is that modern preach|ers attend no more to the method tho&s;e took who were fir&s;t in&s;pired by the Ho|ly Gho&s;t, in preaching Je&s;us Chri&s;t! the &s;uc|ce&s;s they were honored with, gave a &s;anction to their manner of preaching, and the divine au|thority of their di&s;cour&s;es, and energy of their elocution, one would think, &s;hould have more weight with tho&s;e that are called to di&s;pen&s;e the go&s;pel, than all modern &s;chemes whatever. If this was the ca&s;e, mini&s;ters would then learn fir&s;t to &s;ow, and then to reap; they would en|deavour to plow up the fallow ground, and thereby prepare the people for God's raining down ble&s;&s;ings upon them. Thus Peter preached when under a divine influence, as I mentioned la&s;t Wedne&s;day night: he charged
<PB N="87" REF="033217_0094_0FF68F47E34192E0">
the audience home, though many of them were learned and high and great, with having been the murderers of the Son of God. No doubt but the charge entered deep into their con&s;ci|ence, and that faithful monitor beginning to give them a proper &s;en&s;e of them&s;elves, the a|po&s;tle lets them know that great as their &s;in was, it was not unpardonable; that though they had been concerned in the horrid crime of murdering the Lord of Life, notwith&s;tand|ing they had thereby incurred the penalty of eternal death, yet there was a mercy for them, the way to which he points out in the text; <HI>Repent ye therefore,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and be converted,</HI> and adds, <HI>that your &s;ins may be blotted out.</HI> Tho' they are but few words, they are weighty; a &s;hort &s;entence this, but &s;weet: may God make it a ble&s;&s;ed &s;weetne&s;s to every one of your hearts!</P>
<P>But mu&s;t we preach conver&s;ion to a pro|fe&s;&s;ing people? Some of you, perhaps are rea|dy to &s;ay, go to America; go among the &s;a|vages and preach repentance and conver&s;ion there; or, if you mu&s;t be a field-preacher, go to the highways and hedges; go to the colliers; go ramble up and down, as you u&s;ed to do, preach conver&s;ion to the drunkards: would to God my commi&s;&s;ion might be re|newed, that I might have &s;trength and &s;pirit to take the advice!</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly others will &s;ay, do not preach it to us; pray who are you? I an&s;wer, one &s;ent to call you to repentance; and although I might, yet I will not come &s;o clo&s;e to you at pre&s;ent,
<PB N="88" REF="033217_0095_0FF68F4BD20A83D8">
as to enquire in my turn, who are you; yet permit me to pray, that while I am preaching God's Spirit may find you out; and not only let you know who you are, but what you are; and then you will not be ea&s;y with your&s;elves, nor angry with a mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for preaching conver&s;ion to your &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Repentance and conver&s;ion are nearly the &s;ame. The expre&s;&s;ion in the text is complex, and &s;eems to include&punc; both what goes before and follows <HI>turning to God:</HI> and if the Lord is plea&s;ed to honor me &s;o far to night to be u&s;eful to &s;inners, as well as &s;aints, I will en|deavour to &s;hew you,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, what it is not to be converted: &s;e|condly, what it is to be truly converted: third|ly, offer &s;ome motives why you &s;hould repent and be converted: and fourthly, an&s;wer &s;ome objections that have been made again&s;t per&s;ons repenting and being converted, and yet at the &s;ame time, if you come and examine them, they know not &s;o much as &s;peculatively what real conver&s;ion is: the general notion many have of it is, a per&s;on's being a convert from the church of Rome to the church of England. There is a particular office in the large prayer book, to be u&s;ed when any one publicly re|nounces popery in the great congregation. When this is done, that prayer read, and the per&s;on &s;aid Amen to the collects upon the oc|ca&s;ion, every body wi&s;hes him joy, and thanks God he is converted; whereas, if this is all, he is as much unconverted to God as ever; he has in words renounced popery, but never
<PB N="89" REF="033217_0096_0FF68F4DE6D986B0">
took leave of the &s;ins of his heart. Well, af|ter this he looks into the church, and does not like that white thing called a &s;urplice; he looks, and thinks there are &s;ome rags of the whore of Babylon left &s;till: now, &s;ays he, I will be converted; how? I will turn Di&s;&s;ent|er: &s;o after he is converted from the church of Rome to the church of England, he goes to the di&s;&s;enting church: may be, curio&s;ity may bring him to the Methodi&s;ts, tho&s;e mon&s;trous trouble&s;ome creatures, and, perhaps, he may then be converted a third time, like their preaching, like their &s;inging; O dear, I mu&s;t have a Tabernacle-ticket, I mu&s;t have a P&s;alm|book, I will come as often as there is preach|ing, or at lea&s;t as often as I can; and there he &s;its down, and becomes an out&s;ide convert|ed Methodi&s;t, as demure as po&s;&s;ible: this is going a prodigious way, and yet all this is con|ver&s;ion from one party only to another. If the mini&s;ter gives a rub or two he will take miff perhaps, and be converted to &s;ome other per&s;ua&s;ion, and all the while Je&s;us Chri&s;t is left unthought of; but this is conver&s;ion only from party to party, not real, and that which will bring a &s;oul to heaven. Po&s;&s;ibly, a per|&s;on may go further, and be converted from one &s;et of principles to another; he may, for in|&s;tance, be born an Arminian, which all men naturally are; and one rea&s;on why I think Calvini&s;m, right is, becau&s;e proud nature will not &s;toop to be &s;aved by grace. You that are brought up in an orthodox belief, under an orthodox mini&s;try, cannot ea&s;ily make an al|lowance
<PB N="90" REF="033217_0097_0FF68F500037DCC8">
for thou&s;ands that have nothing ring|ing in their ears but Arminiani&s;m; you have &s;ucked in orthodoxy with your mother's milk, and that makes &s;o many &s;our and &s;evere pro|fe&s;&s;ors. I knew a rigid man that would beat Chri&s;tianity into his wife; and &s;o many beat people with their bibles, that they are likely, by their bitter proceeding, to hinder them from attending to the means God has de&s;ign|ed for conver&s;ion. What is this but being converted from one &s;et of principles to ano|ther; and I may be very zealous for them, without being transformed by them into the image of God. But &s;ome go further, they think they are converted becau&s;e they are re|formed: they &s;ay, <HI>a reformed rake makes a good hu&s;band,</HI> but I think a renewed rake will make a better. Reformation is not renovation: I may have the out&s;ide of the platter wa&s;hed; I may be turned from prophanene&s;s to a regard for morality; and becau&s;e I do not &s;wear, nor go to the play as I u&s;ed to do; have left off cards, and perhaps put on a plain dre&s;s; and &s;o believe, or rather fancy, that I am converted; yet the old man remains unmortified, and the heart is unrenewed &s;till. Comparing my&s;elf with what I once was, and looking on my com|panions with di&s;dain, I may there &s;tick fa&s;ter in &s;elf, and get into a wor&s;e and more danger|ous &s;tate than I was before. If any of you think me too &s;evere, remember you are the per&s;on I mean; for you think me &s;o only be|cau&s;e I touch your ca&s;e. The drunkards and &s;abbath-breakers, cur&s;ers and &s;wearers, &s;ay to
<PB N="91" REF="033217_0098_0FF68F521EC8FF28">
us, you can never preach but you preach again&s;t us: as a good man once replied to a per&s;on, who complained again&s;t us mini&s;ters for this preaching; I will put you in a way, &s;aid he, that we &s;hall never preach again&s;t you; how is that? why, leave off cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, &amp;c&punc; then your con&s;ciences will be clear, and the mini&s;ter will look over your heads: happy they that are convinced of it! You have not heard me, I hope, &s;peak a word again&s;t refor|mation; you have not heard me &s;peak a word again&s;t being converted from the church of Rome; again&s;t being converted to the church of England; or, again&s;t being good: no; all the&s;e are right in their place; but all the&s;e conver&s;ions you may have, and yet never be truly converted at all. What is conver&s;ion then? I will not keep you longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, my brethren: man mu&s;t be a new creature, and converted from his own righteou&s;ne&s;s to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; conviction will always preceed &s;piritual con|ver&s;ion: and therefore the prote&s;tant divines make this di&s;tinction, you may be convinced and not converted, but you cannot be con|verted without being convinced; and if we are truly converted, we &s;hall not only be turn|ed and converted from &s;inful &s;elf, but we &s;hall be converted from righteous &s;elf; that is the devil of devils: for righteous &s;elf can run and hide it&s;elf in its own doings, which is the rea&s;on &s;elf-righteous people are &s;o angry with go&s;pel preachers; there are no &s;uch enemies to the go&s;pel as the&s;e: <HI>there were Jews who tru&s;t|ed

in them&s;elves that they were righteous,</HI> that &s;et all in an uproar, and rai&s;ed the mob on the apo&s;tles.

I could almo&s;t &s;ay, this is the la&s;t &s;troke the Lord Je&s;us gave Paul, I mean in turning him to real Chri&s;tianity; for having given him a blow as a per&s;ecutor and injurious, he then brought him out of him&s;elf by revealing his per&s;on and office as a Saviour. <HI>I am Je&s;us,</HI>&mdash;Hence &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>I count all things but lo&s;s&mdash;that I may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him; not having my own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chri&s;t; the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith.</HI> You hear him not only &s;peak of him&s;elf as in|jurious, as a bla&s;phemer, but al&s;o as a Phari|&s;ee; and in vain we may talk of being con|verted till we are brought out of our&s;elves; to come as poor lo&s;t, undone &s;inners, to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to be wa&s;hed in his blood; to be clothed in his glorious imputed right|eou&s;ne&s;s: the con&s;equence of this imputation, or application of a Mediator's righteou&s;ne&s;s to the &s;oul, will be a conver&s;ion from &s;in to ho|line&s;s. I am almo&s;t tempted to &s;ay, it is per|ver&s;ene&s;s in people to preach again&s;t the doc|trine of imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e they love holine&s;s, and charge the Calvini&s;ts with being enemies to it: how can they be charg|ed with being enemies to Sanctification, who

&s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t on its being the genuine fruit, and unque&s;tionable proof of the imputa|tion of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and appli|cation of it by the Spirit of grace? They that are truly converted to Je&s;us, and are ju&s;tifi|ed by faith in the Son of God, will take care to evidence their conver&s;ion, not only by the having grace implanted in their hearts, but by that grace diffu&s;ing it&s;elf through every faculty of the &s;oul, and making an univer&s;al change in the whole man. I am preaching from a bible that &s;aith, <HI>He that is in Chri&s;t is a new creature, old things,</HI> not <HI>will</HI> be, but <HI>are pa&s;&s;ed away, all things,</HI> not only <HI>will,</HI> but <HI>are become new.</HI> As a child when born has all the &s;e|veral parts of a man, it will have no more limbs than it has now, if it lives to four&s;core years and ten; &s;o when a per&s;on is converted to God, there are all the features of the new creature and growth, till he becomes a young man and a father in Chri&s;t; till he becomes ripe in grace, and God tran&s;lates him to glo|ry. Any thing &s;hort of this is but the &s;had|ow in&s;tead of the &s;ub&s;tance; and however per|&s;ons may charge us with being enthu&s;ia&s;ts, yet we need not be moved either to anger or &s;or|row, &s;ince St. Paul &s;ays, <HI>I travel in birth till Chri&s;t be formed in your hearts.</HI></P>
<P>The author of this conver&s;ion is the Holy Gho&s;t: it is not their own free will; it is not moral &s;wa&s;ion; nothing &s;hort of the influence of the Spirit of the living God can effect this change in our hearts; therefore we are &s;aid to <HI>be born again, born of God, of the Spirit, not of water only, but of the Holy Gho&s;t; that which is
<PB N="94" REF="033217_0101_0FF68F88E9ACB768">
born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h, but that which is born of the Spirit is &s;pirit:</HI> and though there is and will be a conte&s;t between the&s;e two oppo&s;ites, fle&s;h and &s;pirit, yet if we are truly converted, the &s;pirit will get the a&s;cendency; and though for a while nature and grace may &s;truggle in the womb of a converted &s;oul, like Jacob and E&s;au, yet the elder &s;hall &s;erve the younger, Jacob &s;hall &s;upplant and turn out E&s;au, or at lea&s;t keep him under: God grant we may all thus prove that we are converted. This con|ver&s;ion, however it begins at home, will &s;oon walk abroad; as the Virgin Mary was &s;oon found out to be with child, &s;o it will be &s;oon found out whether Chri&s;t is formed in the heart. There will be new principles, new ways, new company, new works; there will be a thorough change in the heart and life; this is conver&s;ion: at fir&s;t it begins with ter|ror and legal &s;orrow, afterwards it leads to joy|fulne&s;s; fir&s;t we work for &s;piritual life, after|wards from it: fir&s;t we are in bondage, after|wards we receive the Spirit of adoption to long and thir&s;t for God, becau&s;e he has been plea&s;|ed to let us know that he will take us to hea|ven. Conver&s;ion means a being turned from hell to heaven, from the world to God. We have not &s;o much as a&s;ked a per&s;on to &s;ell his all, to leave his &s;hop, to lay any thing at our feet: when we talk of being converted from the world, we mean being converted from the love of it: the heart once touched with the magnet of divine love, ever after turns to the pole. I think it is &s;aid of a &s;un-flower, tho' I

que&s;tion whether it will always hold true, that it turns to the &s;un; I am &s;ure it is true of the Redeemer's flowers that grow in his garden, they not only look to the &s;un, but they find fre&s;h life, warmth, and transforming influence from him who is their all in all. Here Chri&s;t|ianity appears in its glory; here the work done is worthy the Son of God. To be con|verted only to a party, is that worth Chri&s;t's coming from heaven to earth for; that we might have a &s;et of principles without having them affect the heart? for to be baptized when young, or as &s;ome to come out of the water at age, and turn out as bad as ever, is a plain proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of being baptized by the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you to this change, my dear &s;ouls? is it not god-like, is it not divine, is it not hea|ven brought down to the &s;oul; have you felt it, have you experienced it? I begin to cat|echize you already, for I could &s;pend a whole &s;ermon in &s;peaking of conver&s;ion; but I am afraid tho&s;e that &s;it under the go&s;pel have more need of heat than light: would to God we had as much warmth in our hearts, as light in our under&s;tandings! But if there be any of you here that are not yet converted, upon what grounds do you hope for conver&s;ion? give me leave to &s;ay, that you ought to repent and be converted, for till then you never can, never will, never &s;hall find true re&s;t for your &s;ouls. What wrong notions have people got of conver&s;ion! they think it is a wretched thing, and dread being converted; not know|ing
<PB N="96" REF="033217_0103_0FF68F8E2EB06480">
what it is, they think it is a frightful thing. I knew one &s;ometime ago, that came to &s;ome Methodi&s;ts; dear, &s;ays the per&s;on, you are chearful, I could be glad if I was a Methodi&s;t too, if there was a majority of them in the land: but God help us to go to heaven with the minority, if the majority will not follow. But, my dear hearers, there is not a &s;ingle &s;oul of you all that are &s;atisfied in your &s;tations: is not the language of your hearts when ap|prentices, we think we &s;hall do very well when journeymen; when journeymen, that we &s;hould do very well when ma&s;ters: when &s;ingle, that we &s;hall do well when married; and to be &s;ure you think you &s;hall do well when you keep a carriage. I have heard of one who began low; he fir&s;t wanted a hou&s;e, then, &s;ays he, I want two, then four, then &s;ix; and when he had them, he &s;aid, I think I want nothing el&s;e; yes, &s;ays his friend, you will &s;oon want another thing, that is, a hear&s;e and &s;ix to carry you to your grave; and that made him tremble. O if you are Chri&s;tians, if the Lord loves you, he will put a thorn in your fle&s;h. I have often thought of what a good man &s;ays in his Diary, the Lord put a thorn in my fle&s;h. Among politicians, when they find a man ambitious, they &s;ay, kick him up, that he may fall and break his neck: &s;o it is in every condition; there is not one of you fifty years old, but have had many changes: have not you found thorns even on the ro&s;e that &s;melt &s;o &s;weet, and thorns perhaps that pricked you &s;o clo&s;ely, that you have forgot

the &s;cent of the ro&s;e by it? and what is all this for, but to teach you that happine&s;s is only to be found in the Lord. If a &s;oul is truly con|verted, there will be a battle, and an awful cha&s;m that will never be filled up but with the love of God; and therefore when we &s;ay, Re|pent and be converted, it is no more than &s;ay|ing, repent and be happy. Indeed we &s;hall never be completely happy till we get to hea|ven. O that every man could &s;ee the good of every thing of a &s;ublunary nature drop off like leaves in autumn: God grant this may be known by every one of you.</P>
<P>If it is a&s;ked, why you &s;hould repent and be converted? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e el&s;e you can ne|ver be happy hereafter. What do you think heaven is? why, &s;ays the covetous man, I think it is a place full of gold; &s;o you think to &s;teal &s;ome of the gold, do you? Others would like heaven very well if there was a good gaming-table in heaven; if there was card-playing in heaven. I have heard of a la|dy that was &s;o fond of gaming, that tho' &s;he had the pangs of death upon her, yet when in the mid&s;t of her fits, or ju&s;t coming out of one, in&s;tead of a&s;king after Je&s;us, where he was to be found, &s;he a&s;ked, what is trumps? So the gam&s;ter will a&s;k, where is the back|gammon table? where is the box? he will want to &s;hake his ungodly hand in heaven; he will &s;ay, let us have a gaming-table in hea|ven, where, as he will find, he has lo&s;t the game; that God has damned him without an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. <HI>Can two walk together un|le&s;s

they are agreed?</HI> If you die and do not love God here, if you cannot love praying to God here, and cannot watch one hour, &s;up|po&s;e you was to be &s;truck by death and be taken to heaven, there is no &s;uch language &amp; amu&s;ement there, what would you do? Why, &s;ay you, the&s;e Methodi&s;ts are pre&s;umptuous people, they can tell us whether we are to go to heaven or no. Good Mr. Rogers, a Wel&s;h Boanerges, preaching in the mountains, &s;aid, Chri&s;t is heaven, if I wor&s;hip God here, and do all to God, and for God, without any hopes of reward upon the earth. My dear brethren, the devils would never be troubled with &s;uch a wretch in hell, he would &s;et all hell in an up|roar; if a true Methodi&s;t was to go to hell, the devil would &s;ay, turn that Methodi&s;t out, he is come to torment us: therefore, you mu&s;t be converted if you will go to heaven. Dr. Scott &s;ays, if a natural man was to be put in|to heaven, it would be &s;uch a hell to him, that he would be glad to go to hell for &s;helter: angels they hate, God they hate; and as Ad|am was afraid to meet with God when he fir&s;t fell from him, &s;o his &s;ons hate God and flee away.</P>
<P>I mention one thing more, which is, that you mu&s;t be converted, or be damned, and that is plain Engli&s;h, but not plainer than my Ma&s;ter made u&s;e of, <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> I did not &s;peak that word &s;trong enough that &s;ays, <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned;</HI> that is the language of our Lord; and it is &s;aid of one of the primitive preach|ers,

that u&s;ed to &s;peak the word damned &s;o that it &s;truck all his auditory. We are afraid of &s;peaking the word damned for fear of of|fending &s;uch and &s;uch a one; at the &s;ame time they de&s;pi&s;e the mini&s;ter for not being hone&s;t to his ma&s;ter. Some have &s;aid, and &s;tand to it, that hell is only a temporary puni&s;hment: Who told them &s;o? A temporary puni&s;h|ment! nothing but a guilty con&s;cience. O go to Bedlam! Do a&s;k a child of God what he feels when his Lord is ab&s;ent? A&s;k the &s;pou&s;e what &s;he felt when &s;he cries, <HI>Saw ye him whom my &s;oul loveth?</HI> A&s;k a child of God when he is u&s;ing this plaintive language, <HI>Why &s;tande&s;t thou afar off, O Lord?</HI> and he will tell you, it is hell to my &s;oul to be but one mo|ment without the pre&s;ence of my beloved. And if his ab&s;ence for a quarter of an hour can &s;carce be borne by a child of God, what mu&s;t that &s;oul undergo that is commanded to depart from him forever? and yet the&s;e very words were &s;aid to tho&s;e that thought they bid fair for heaven; to the&s;e Je&s;us &s;ays, <HI>I know ye not.</HI> God grant you may never know the meaning of the&s;e words by awful experi|ence! Now, what &s;ay you? I could make a hundred heads more, but I chu&s;e to make as few as po&s;&s;ible, that you may remember them. I &s;ay, conver&s;ion makes you happy hereafter, and without it you are damned forever.</P>
<P><HI>Are the&s;e things &s;o?</HI> why then, my dear hearers, do you think there can be any ob|jection rai&s;ed again&s;t conver&s;ion, do you think there can be any argument rai&s;ed again&s;t turn|ing

Is not this act|ing like the cardinal, when told he was elected pope, and de&s;ired to come that night and have the honor of pope conferred on him; becau&s;e it was pretty late &s;aid, it is not a work of dark|ne&s;s, I will put it off till the morning; before which they cho&s;e another pope, and he lo&s;t his triple crown.

and yet there are a great many here, I dare &s;ay, twenty years old, and not converted. Some are of opinion, that mo&s;t people that are con|verted, are &s;o before thirty.

<P>OH! what a di&s;mal &s;ight is it, to &s;ee an old man with his hoary head grown grey in &s;in, and hardened in iniquity. On the other hand, I believe to all that con&s;ider right|ly, there is no grander &s;ight almo&s;t under the &s;un, than to &s;ee an old grey-headed man keep|ing up a con&s;i&s;tent character; and proving, by his conduct, that <HI>his path,</HI> like that of the ju&s;t, <HI>is as the &s;hining light, that &s;hineth more and more to the perfect day:</HI> e&s;pecially when per&s;ons have been called to act in a public character; when they have been eminent either for the highne&s;s of their &s;tation, or for the largene&s;s of their income. It is on this account that I admire old Jacob; how grand he looked when leaning on his &s;taff, with all the compo&s;ure in the world, under a divine influence, ble&s;&s;ing his
<PB N="107" REF="033217_0114_0FF68FAB74C097C8">
children &s;tanding round him. But, methinks, there is one who was called to act a more pub|lic part, namely, Mo&s;es, who was honored of God to be a great legi&s;lator, king in Je&s;hurun, a lawgiver between Judah's feet, as pupils u&s;ed to be at the feet of their teachers, to receive their in&s;truction; if you have a mind to &s;ee how bright he &s;hines, you mu&s;t read Deut. xxxii. indeed you mu&s;t read all Deuteronomy, which is nothing but a &s;ermon that Mo&s;es, at various times, preached to the children of I&s;|rael; and having done preaching, he &s;ang a hymn of his own compo&s;ing, and that too at a time when he knew, at the very fini&s;hing the &s;ong, he &s;hould immediately have his &s;oul ki&s;&s;ed away, and be called to &s;ing a better &s;ong in the kingdom of heaven. A per&s;on would need a good deal of compo&s;ure, a good deal of the Spirit's influences, a large mea&s;ure of it, cheerfully thus to &s;tand in view of death, ju&s;t on the very borders of the grave; you &s;ee this in chap. xxxii. &amp; here in chap. xxxiii. One would have thought he had &s;aid enough, yet he &s;eems as it were not to know how to leave off; he parted from the people ble&s;&s;ing them; they had u&s;ed him ill, they provoked him in the wilderne&s;s; he had bore with them many, many long years; &s;ure you would have thought he would have went away in a huff; no, that eminent &s;un by no means goes down in wrath; his eyes did not &s;o much as wax dim, nor his intellectual powers impair in all that time: he &s;weetly gives them all a ble&s;&s;ing before he goes.

various, yet &s;pecial, are the ble&s;&s;ings which, in a prophetic &s;train, he foretels &s;hould attend particular per&s;ons, or tribes. I have been reading them over, and though I admire them all, I was at a lo&s;s which to &s;peak from, till the ble&s;&s;ing of Benjamin fixed my attention, not only as &s;weet, but in&s;tructing. <HI>The beloved of the Lord &s;hall dwell in &s;afety, by him: and the Lord &s;hall cover him all the day long, he &s;hall dwell between his &s;houlders.</HI> This is a ble&s;&s;ing indeed, if we look only to the literal interpre|tation of the words, and a literal commentator can go no further; he mu&s;t confine them to Benjamin; and will tell us, that this &s;cripture was fulfilled at the building of the Temple. The Temple was built upon two hills, one in the tribe of Benjamin the other in the tribe of Judah; the Temple being built there, and Benjamin being placed near it, then Benjamin dwells in &s;afety by the Lord, by having his lot ca&s;t near the Temple. How often, alas! is it the ca&s;e, I am &s;ure it is very often the ca&s;e in London, the nearer the church the fur|ther from God; but &s;ome make good u&s;e of it, and are glad to get near the church that they may be nearer God. The temple being placed between two hills, &s;o Benjamin as it were dwells between God's &s;houlders; &s;o far a lit|eral commentator can go, here he &s;tops; a &s;piritual commentator, and a &s;piritual reader, go further; O, &s;ays he, this is true, but at the &s;ame time this is not the whole truth; and I am per&s;uaded, when a per&s;on is helped by the Spirit to read the &s;criptures, the declarations

that are made, and tho&s;e particular promi&s;es, the true believer applies with great propriety to him&s;elf; and therefore I think I may ven|ture to aver, that the ble&s;&s;ing which Mo&s;es here pronounces upon him in the name of the Lord, belongs to God's people in all ages whatever; God, in his infinite mercy, grant that this ble&s;&s;ing may de&s;cend upon us and ours, that it may de&s;cend to your late&s;t po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve how wonderfully the per&s;ons, to whom the ble&s;&s;ing is given, are characterized: of Benjamin it is &s;aid, <HI>the beloved of the Lord:</HI> the beloved of the Lord, pray who are they? why, the men that the Scriptures always &s;peak of, who&s;e con&s;tant uniform character is, they love God in all ages. It is not &s;aid, the Pre&s;|byterians &s;hall dwell in &s;afety; Mo&s;es never heard of a Pre&s;byterian in his life: he never heard of the name; nor is it &s;aid the Inde|pendents &s;hall dwell in &s;afety; he never heard of that word; nor is it &s;aid the Papi&s;ts &s;hall dwell in &s;afety; he never heard of Papi&s;ts, nor of the pope; nor is it &s;aid that the Church of England &s;hall dwell in &s;afety, no; neither is it &s;aid that the methodi&s;ts &s;hall dwell in &s;afe|ty, though I tru&s;t there are a great many good people among the&s;e mongrels of the church; but it is &s;poken of all the people of God; God help us all to apply it to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Here is a di&s;pute between the Arminians and the Calvini&s;ts: a&s;k an Arminian what is meant by <HI>the beloved of the Lord;</HI> O, &s;ay they that are for general redemption, the beloved

of the Lord &s;ignifies, all the men that were ever born into the world; that is a good broad bridge to take them in; but broad bridges are not always the &s;tronge&s;t bridges in the world. The Arminians will a&s;&s;ert it that Ju|das was as much beloved of God as Peter, or any other of the apo&s;tles; and tho&s;e that are not Arminians, but are what you call Quak|ers, and there are good many, I believe among them, that have better hearts than heads, they &s;ay, that we are all alike, that we all come into the world with a &s;eed of grace, and &s;hall be happy according to the improvement of that grace; hence they talk nothing of a Chri&s;t <HI>without</HI> but <HI>within:</HI> happy they that experi|ence a Chri&s;t within! God's mercy is &s;ure, and over all his works; and in one &s;en&s;e, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Saviour of all men, that is, of all &s;orts of men; even the wicked are be|holden to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom they de&s;pi&s;e, for every worldly comfort they enjoy; in this &s;en&s;e we &s;hould learn to love as our Lord, we are told, loved the young man when he &s;aw he had been a harmle&s;s and good liver: but we mu&s;t go more to what we call Calvini&s;m, what I call &s;piritual truth. The love which Je&s;us Chri&s;t bore for the young man, quite differed from that love with which he loved Martha, Mary, and their brother; there was a cargo for you! three in one family; God grant it may be your happy lot and mine! two &s;i&s;ters and one brother, three to entertain Je&s;us Chri&s;t, all in a peculiar manner beloved of the Lord. It is not &s;aid of Benjamin, they &s;hall,
<PB N="111" REF="033217_0118_0FF68FB54A628608">
that is, they that love the Lord, they &s;hall dwell in &s;afety, no; it would not be &s;o &s;trong to them, as to &s;ay, <HI>the beloved of the Lord:</HI> for God knows our love is not worth a &s;hil|ling; all the faith of God's people, &s;ays bi&s;hop Hall, is but meer infidelity; and all the love of the people of God is but meer hatred, com|pared with God's love, or that which his law ju&s;tly requires; therefore it is &s;aid, <HI>beloved of the Lord,</HI> and that becau&s;e if ever we love God, he fir&s;t loved us, which is what Mo&s;es's very expre&s;&s;ion means; as &s;treams flow from the fountain, &s;o they &s;hall return to it. Hence the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Knowing your election, breth|ren, beloved of God.</HI> I know very well the My&s;ticks talk of loving God with a love for him&s;elf only, without any re&s;pect to the crea|ture at all; that is, we mu&s;t love God with|out any regard at all for what God has done for us; nay, &s;ome go &s;o far as to &s;ay, that if we do not &s;o love God, we are not converted, though we have as much grace as we can have; that we do not love God properly till we love him for what he is, not what he has done for us: I verily believe, the angels do not love God in that manner; and we cannot love God till we are made partakers of a divine nature, and have eyes given us to &s;ee his glory.</P>
<P>The grand enquiry is then, how &s;hall I know that I am one of the beloved of the Lord? The natural man never minds the love of God; he flatters him&s;elf he loves God nat|urally, that the love of God is a plant that grows in nature's garden; but a &s;piritual per|&s;on does not &s;o. What does the king take
<PB N="112" REF="033217_0119_0FF68FB819D27558">
notice of me? does the king look plea&s;ant up|on me in a drawing-room? am I called to wait upon him? am I beloved of this, and that, and the other per&s;on? if I am, let God go, I care not; if I have but the love of this and that courtier, I care not whether God loves me or no; this will not do for an awak|ened &s;oul; and therefore the grand enquiry, and one proof of a per&s;on's being awakened is, how &s;hall I know whether God loves me or not? why try; I am per&s;uaded of it, that we may as well know that God loves us, and we love God, as we may know that the &s;un &s;hines at noon-day; how &s;hall I know it but by the effects of this love, by the fruits of it? That great man, Dr. Watts, who was called the &s;weet &s;inger of I&s;rael, &s;ays, "we &s;hould go fir&s;t to the grammar-&s;chool of faith and repentance, before we go to the univer&s;ity of prede&s;tina|tion:" whereas the devil would have them go fir&s;t to the univer&s;ity, to examine whether they were elected or rejected, or no: they &s;hould do as a good woman once did, when &s;atan tempted her, and wanted to di&s;tre&s;s her, that there were but few to be &s;aved; &s;he &s;aid, if there were but two to be &s;aved, &s;he would &s;trive to be one of them. Surely I am belov|ed of the Lord, if my natural enmity again&s;t the Lord is &s;lain. How do I know I love a per&s;on? how can you prove that you love me? why, &s;ay you, I hated you the other day: how many people met I with the other day, that could a few weeks ago have pulled me out of Tottenham-court, but God has over|come their hearts.

his former enmity, and when that enmity is removed, and you are reconciled to them, cannot you know that you love them? and if God has removed that enmity to Chri&s;t out of your hearts, &s;urely you are one of the beloved of the Lord.</P>
<P>We are the beloved of the Lord, if we are brought to abhor and renounce that which &s;tands between us and the Lord; I mean, our cur&s;ed &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s. Can I prove that I have renounced my own duties, that I am &s;ick of my duties as well as my &s;ins; none but the beloved of the Lord &s;ee this: an enemy to the Lord may have this in his head, but it is only a friend of the Lord that has this in his heart: a talkative profe&s;&s;or can &s;peak of it: you may teach, perhaps, a parrot to pray, but it is odds to talk like a parrot, and experience like a chri&s;tian. Now I have renounced my own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and been helped to tru&s;t to Chri&s;t's, to believe on the Son of God, let &s;a|tan &s;ay what he will, I am &s;ure I am the be|loved of the Lord, for none but tho&s;e that are beloved by him with an everla&s;ting love, are brought to believe on him.</P>
<P>I may know I am beloved of the Lord, from what? why, experiencing <HI>his love &s;hed abroad in my heart by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Jonathan loved David as his own &s;oul. Mo&s;t of you know what love is in a carnal &s;en&s;e; and if there be a union of &s;ouls between creature and creature, &s;urely there mu&s;t be a union of &s;ouls between the Creator and the creature beloved of God; it cannot be otherwi&s;e; this love will have its effects.</P>

If I am beloved of the Lord, if having his love in my heart, I &s;how it by loving tho&s;e he has loved. Some people may &s;ay, I love you, but I do not love tho&s;e about you, your friends; why you are not bound to love all alike, but it may teach you to be civil to that per&s;on's beloved. As &s;oon as ever we hear of a chri&s;|tian, as &s;oon as ever we hear of a believer, as &s;oon as ever we hear of a &s;inner turning to God, O it will rejoice us; and we &s;hall be like, the angels in heaven, who <HI>rejoice over one &s;in|ner's repentance, more than over ninety-nine ju&s;t per&s;ons that need no repentance.</HI> Some people may &s;ay, I love dearly to hear of a per&s;on's being converted by &s;uch a mini&s;ter; I love dearly to hear of per&s;ons converted by a di&s;|&s;enter; I love dearly to hear of per&s;ons con|verted by a churchman, but I do not like peo|ple &s;hould be converted by this and that per|&s;on; why I believe there are a great many people who&s;e hearts are thus narrow, but this mixture is not of God; and I pray God they may know it by experience; that they may know they are beloved of God, then they will rejoice when other people are brought to be|lieve on him, whoever is made the in&s;trument. <HI>Grace and mercy be with all them that love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;incerity.</HI> What would have become of poor Paul if he had only lov|ed his own followers: the Romans he never &s;aw till he was taken there a pri&s;oner, but he loved all the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, writ letters to all &s;orts, not to their particular parties or chur|ches, but to all tho&s;e <HI>that loved the Lord Je&s;us

in &s;incerity;</HI> and if we do love in this manner, we may be a&s;&s;ured we are beloved of the Lord, for none but the Lord could beget &s;uch love in us.</P>
<P>If we are beloved of the Lord, we &s;hall be hated by the world. <HI>If you were of the world, the world would love you, but becau&s;e you are not of the world, but I have cho&s;en you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</HI> Will you make me believe that any of you are beloved of the Lord, that never lo&s;t your good char|acter by it; why you may as well make me believe that you are emperors of the world: where is the ble&s;&s;ing the &s;ermon on the mount &s;peaks of; where is the ble&s;&s;ing of per&s;ecution; where is the ble&s;&s;ing of being hated of all men; where is the ble&s;&s;ing of being hated for the cro&s;s? you love the Lord, and not carry the cro&s;s after you; you love the Lord, and not be hated as your Lord was? I don't &s;ay all are hated alike; poor mini&s;ters are &s;et in the front of the battle; in proportion to our &s;ucce&s;&s;es we &s;hall be hated. There are numbers of mini&s;ters now &s;leep in whole &s;kins, that were formerly in a wor&s;e plight; the devil di&s;turbs them not becau&s;e they are quite civil, and do not trouble and contradict him; but if you oppo&s;e the world and the devil, the world will hate you; and no greater proof of being beloved of the Lord, than the world hating you, but it mu&s;t be for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. So Ahab &s;aid of the prophet, <HI>all his prophe&s;ying is again&s;t me;</HI> I hate him; the world hated him; <HI>the world hated me,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>before it hated

you:</HI> and the apo&s;tles, when they began to &s;peak for God too, they were hated like their Lord, and glory to God for it, for it is a ble&s;|&s;ed mark of their belonging to God, when they are honored to &s;uffer for him, and we are never right till we are bearing the cro&s;s: to &s;ee men or women &s;leeping under the cro&s;s, &s;kulk|ing and hiding from it, is this love? give me a profe&s;&s;or that will wear a cockade in his hat, and is never ea&s;ier than when he is combating the enemies of his King.</P>
<P>If I am the beloved of the Lord, I really &s;hall live above the world. You may &s;ay what you will, and you may bring the &s;criptures as low as you think proper, <HI>but the friend&s;hip of the world is hatred to God; and if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</HI> Now by not loving the world, I don't mean that you &s;hould &s;hut up your &s;hops, and run into a convent: how idle for per&s;ons to &s;ay they love God, and hide them&s;elves from the world; that is no religion at all. But the greate&s;t proof of a Chri&s;tian's loving God is, I am in the world, but not of it; I work with my hands all the day, but my heart is from it. I remember a dear friend once &s;ent me word, many years ago, how bu&s;y he was morning and night, up early and late; per|haps, &s;ays he, you will think by this account, I am worldly; he &s;aid, no, &s;ir, I thank God that my heart is above the world: God grant we may thus prove we love God?

leave all for Chri&s;t, it is a great mercy: God be prai&s;ed, we have &s;ome &s;uch; God add to their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>They that love the Lord, will &s;tudy to keep from offending God, not for fear of being damned, but becau&s;e &s;in murdered his dear Son; there are a great many people ab&s;tain from &s;in for fear of puni&s;hment; but hear what Jo&s;eph &s;aid, <HI>My ma&s;ter has done thus and thus by me, how can I therefore do this great wicked|ne&s;s and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI> my God that loves me; &s;o they would not &s;tab him, becau&s;e he has been wounded enough already.</P>
<P>If we are the beloved of the Lord, we &s;hall be willing to work for the Lord; faith with|out works is the religion of every carnal man; make an end of one good work and then be|gin another, and lay it down and wonder that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould accept any thing at your hands. I knew a lady &s;ome time ago, that wanted &s;till more to be employed for God; &s;ays &s;he, if Je&s;us Chri&s;t would but help me to do &s;uch and &s;uch a thing I have in view, O I would ki&s;s his feet, and dedicate my&s;elf more and more to his honour: a true chri&s;tian loves to be thus employed, but above all he is glad he has the blood of Chri&s;t to wa&s;h his duties in.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention but one thing more, though I might mention twenty; if we have the love of God in our hearts, though we cannot get over the fears of death at all times, yet I think the bent of the mind of &s;uch a per&s;on will be, when &s;hall I &s;ee the object of my love, <HI>him whom my &s;oul loves?</HI> they &s;it at ordinances, and

I could not help admiring while I was reading it, that when Chri&s;t a&s;cended to hea|ven, one angel, one particular angel, it mu&s;t have been a ble&s;&s;ed one, left tho&s;e that were attending Chri&s;t into glory, &s;topped in the way, for what? why, to preach to the apo&s;|tles: <HI>Why &s;tand ye thus gazing into heaven?</HI> I am a&s;hamed of you, &s;ays he; here is an an|gel, one of the convoy, waiting upon them: he does not &s;ay, let me go to heaven with thee, and let me come down again and preach, no; he &s;tays down thus to preach to a few poor fi&s;hermen.

<P>So that &s;ome may &s;ay, I think I can apply all the marks, though I don't depend upon marks.

<P>GRACIOUS words indeed! words wor|thy of a God! who has promi&s;ed that <HI>he will not always cha&s;ti&s;e, that he will not keep his anger for ever;</HI> but, on the contrary, will take care in the mid&s;t of judgment to remem|ber mercy; and if he &s;trikes with one hand, will uphold with the other.</P>
<P>I hope I need not tell you, my dear hearers, that the&s;e words were &s;poken to comfort the captives in Babylon, who, for their various &s;ins and great back&s;lidings, con&s;trained the God of love, the God of mercy, their covenant God, to &s;end them captives into a foreign &s;oil; upon this their enemies take occa&s;ion to in&s;ult them, <HI>where are now your &s;ongs?</HI> &s;ay they, give us one of your temple &s;ongs, with which you u&s;ed to pour out your allelujahs; let us &s;ee now whether you can prai&s;e him in a &s;trange land.

with them without, makes &s;ome that can &s;ing, even afraid <HI>that God hath forgotten to be graci|ous, that he hath &s;hut up his loving kindne&s;s in di&s;plea&s;ure,</HI> that the darkne&s;s in which they were now involved would not be a temporary, but a perpetual one; and notwith&s;tanding the prophets were &s;ent in mercy of God to com|fort them in their trouble, yet many of them were tempted to &s;ay, <HI>all men,</HI> yea the prophets, <HI>were liars:</HI> it is very well if they &s;topped there, and did not &s;ay, God is a liar too. The ene|my being thus &s;uffered to break in upon them like a flood, it was high time for the ble&s;&s;ed God to lift up a &s;tandard again&s;t him; and therefore the great Redeemer, the angel of the everla&s;ting covenant, lets them know that he would &s;ome time or other, nay very &s;peed|ily, appear to relieve his afflicted people: he a&s;&s;ures them, that however for a while he might &s;uffer them to be tried, he would cau&s;e a &s;peedy deliverance, that &s;hould make them look upon him as their God; and this not for any merit found in this people, not for any good fore&s;een, but he &s;ays, <HI>for my own name's &s;ake;</HI> that the heathen might not &s;ay God had utterly for&s;aken them, he will appear for their relief, and <HI>make them more than conquerors through him that loved them;</HI> that however dark the &s;ea&s;on of affliction might be, yet he would let his own people know that all that happen|ed, happened out of love; that it was &s;o far from being true, that they were really ca&s;t off from God, that, on the contrary, he intended to over-rule the&s;e troubles, both foreign and

dome&s;tic, to bring them nearer to, and at la&s;t to lodge them &s;afe in the world above; well therefore for their comfort might it be u&s;her|ed in thus, <HI>for my name's &s;ake will I defer my anger, and for my prai&s;e will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</HI> And to fix their atten|tion and gratitude, 'tis added, <HI>behold I have re|fined thee, but not with &s;ilver;</HI> for this is &s;o far from being contrary to the everla&s;ting decree, or purpo&s;e, hid in my bo&s;om, that, on the contrary, it is the fulfilling it; for, &s;aith God in the words of our text, <HI>I have cho&s;en thee in the furnace of affliction.</HI></P>
<P>Though the words are &s;poken in the &s;ingu|lar number, yet they are of a complex and large import; the great God not only &s;peaks to them as a people collectively con&s;idered, but particularizes them in this manner; not <HI>I have cho&s;en you, but I have cho&s;en thee;</HI> for the word of God it&s;elf will never, never, never do us good, if it is not applied by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God to you and I. The wi&s;dom and kindne&s;s of the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;erves our no|tice; had the prophet gone on and &s;aid, <HI>I have cho&s;en you,</HI> unbelief might have &s;aid, ah, this prophe&s;y belongs only to the people of I&s;rael, the words were addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e who were under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, what have I to do with them? or unbelief would per&s;uade us to &s;ay &s;o of &s;uch a general promi&s;e as this; but when it is &s;aid I have cho&s;en <HI>thee,</HI> and we know that no &s;cripture is of private interpreta|tion, but, like its ble&s;&s;ed author, is <HI>the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever,</HI> there is no loop|hole,

as it were, for unbelief to creep out at; but every believer may, in all ages, in the words of the text, &s;ay to him&s;elf, <HI>God has cho|&s;en me in the furnace of affliction.</HI> Perhaps, there is not a more comfortable pa&s;&s;age in the whole book of God; I do not know of one that has a greater tendency to &s;ilence a complaining child of God, or to make a poor &s;uffering be|liever happy, and to re&s;t under the promi&s;e, to ki&s;s the rod of God that &s;trikes the blow.</P>
<P>Where &s;hall I begin, where &s;hall I end? the very fir&s;t words open &s;uch a field, that eterni|ty it&s;elf will be but ju&s;t long enough for us to take a view of it; the time is come that even &s;ome good people that have the grace of God in their hearts, have &s;uch muddy heads as to kick at the doctrine of election, and look up|on it as having a tendency to make us bad in our heads, or Antinomians in our hearts: but if we have eyes to &s;ee, and ears to hear, and if our hearts are really informed by the Spirit; if we have been anointed with his eye-&s;alve, O then electing, &s;overeign, di&s;tingui&s;hing love flows in &s;uch a &s;cene, &s;uch a tran&s;porting &s;cene, as will make a believer's heart leap for joy. For my own part I know no other doctrine that can truly humble the man; for either God mu&s;t chu&s;e us, or we mu&s;t chu&s;e God; either God mu&s;t be the fir&s;t mover, or man mu&s;t be the fir&s;t mover; either God mu&s;t chu&s;e them on account of &s;ome goodne&s;s, on account of &s;ome purity, or acts of piety, or God mu&s;t chu&s;e them merely of his grace, for his own name's &s;ake, and to let us know that we have

not cho&s;en him, but he has cho&s;en us. I verily believe, that the grand rea&s;on why &s;uch doc|trine is &s;o &s;purned at, and hated by carnal peo|ple, is, that it &s;trikes at the very root of hu|man pride, cuts the &s;inews of free-will all to pieces, and brings the poor &s;inner to lie down at the foot of &s;overeign grace; and, let his at|tainments in the &s;chool of Chri&s;t be ever &s;o great, it con&s;trains him to cry out, Lord, why me! why me! Our Ma&s;ter, and I think we &s;hould not attempt to be wi&s;er than our Ma&s;ter was, &s;peaks particularly of and to his own &s;chool, his little college of apo&s;tles: <HI>Thine they were and thou gave&s;t them me; I have cho&s;en you, but ye have not cho&s;en me.&mdash;Becau&s;e I have cho&s;en you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</HI> Before they were fully enlightened, though they were afterwards brought more to the light, two of them at fir&s;t &s;aid, <HI>we have found the Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> yet when they were &s;unk deeper in the knowledge of them&s;elves, they changed their note, and &s;aid, the Me&s;&s;iah has found us. Ob&s;erve the man|ner of the Redeemer's addre&s;&s;ing our fir&s;t pa|rent, when their guilt had cau&s;ed them to hide them&s;elves, <HI>Adam where art thou?</HI> Pray who called fir&s;t, did Adam call after Chri&s;t, or did Chri&s;t call after him; or do you think there is any difference between us and Adam, or that we have got better hearts than Adam had; do you think we are wi&s;er and better now? Adam run away from God and &s;o &s;hould we to this very day, unle&s;s Je&s;us Chri&s;t had called us to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="033217_0137_0FF68FE372D14ED0">
Some per&s;ons, perhaps, may &s;ay, Well, I like your doctrine very well; God chu&s;es us, you &s;ay, when we have no regard to any good works at all, therefore I will go on &s;inning, becau&s;e the fitter I &s;hall be for God's grace; and the fitter thou may&s;t be for hell. Grace does not de&s;troy the u&s;e of the law: an hone&s;t heart will draw that inference from it, as a good woman once did when the devil told her, that either God had cho&s;en her and &s;he &s;hould be &s;aved, or if &s;he was rejected &s;he &s;hould be damned, &s;o, &s;aid he, you need not &s;trive; &s;he an&s;wered, if there were but two to be &s;aved, I would &s;trive to be one of them: God help us to draw that inference.</P>
<P>Now this word <HI>cho&s;en,</HI> refers us to God's eternal election; it comprehends, and is the &s;ource of all that God has done for believers, for every individual believer in particular when Je&s;us bowed his head and gave up the gho&s;t. Hence the apo&s;tle, in the eighth of the Ro|mans, mentioning this doctrine in the cleare&s;t manner, triumphs over the accu&s;er by a&s;king, <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?</HI> and in the &s;ame chapter declares, <HI>that it is God that glorifies:</HI> for though glorification is the la&s;t thing done to us, yet it is the fir&s;t thing God de&s;igns for us. What is the great thing for a natural man to hear? what is it? why, not only that God has cho&s;en us, but <HI>cho&s;en us in the furnace of affliction:</HI> O that the Spirit of God may vouch&s;afe to tran&s;cribe the&s;e words into our hearts! God help thee to take it to thy&s;elf, O man; to take it to
<PB N="131" REF="033217_0138_0FF66AD666571428">
thy&s;elf, O woman; to take it to thy&s;elf who|ever thou art that art either a chri&s;tian now, or de&s;ires or hopes to be a chri&s;tian before thou die&s;t, <HI>I have cho&s;en thee in the furnace of affliction.</HI></P>
<P>What can be the meaning of the words? why, 'tis very plain that the import of them mu&s;t be this; I have cho&s;en thee, and it is my determination from everla&s;ting to the end of time, and for ever. I have cho&s;en thee with this determination, that the way to heaven &s;hould be through the road of affliction: this is the believer's way, e&s;pecially the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. When Paul was converted, pray what preferment did God promi&s;e him? was it to be a great dignitary in the church? no, nothing about the church? was it any more ea&s;e, was it to wear a triple crown, were per|&s;ons to come and ki&s;s his toe, what preferment did God chu&s;e him to? what? &s;ays God, <HI>I will &s;how him what great things he mu&s;t &s;uffer for my name's &s;ake.</HI> I verily believe, that if we were to have no other preferment than this of Paul, there is not one in a thou&s;and of the mini&s;ters that would a&s;k for a living, if they knew they were to have &s;uch poor wages as Paul had. Mini&s;ters that hold the &s;tandard up, mu&s;t expect the enemy will fire on them from every quarter; and if they happen to be in&s;trumental in comforting others, <HI>with the &s;ame comforts where with they them&s;elves are com|forted of God,</HI> they mu&s;t expect to bear their part, not only for their own purification, but for the benefit of tho&s;e to whom they mini&s;ter; and I believe audiences find that mini&s;ters

mini&s;ter be&s;t, and the bread comes be&s;t, when it comes out of the furnace of a mini&s;ter's af|fliction.</P>
<P>The word affliction is of a very complex kind; it is like the word tribulation, which comes from the latin <HI>tribulus,</HI> &s;ignifying a pricking thorn, a &s;cratching briar, or wound|ing &s;pikes concealed in the way; and the word affliction ari&s;es from a word that &s;ignifies &s;ome|thing that beats down, pre&s;&s;es &s;ore, and is very grievous and tormenting; it is a word of &s;o general import, that it takes in all the trouble we meet with from men, all the wounds we receive from enemies, as well as in the hou&s;e of our friends; it takes in all our dome&s;tic trials, all our inward &s;truggles and dreadful temptations occa&s;ioned by the fiery darts of a watchful devil; and if I am not mi&s;taken, when the great God &s;aid, <HI>I have cho&s;en thee in the furnace of affliction,</HI> it implies, that this is really to continue with us even to the very end of our days: this is what young converts, in the time of their fir&s;t love, do not &s;ee; that is, do not wholly &s;ee it; for if young chri&s;tians were to know all they have to &s;uffer, it would dreadfully di&s;courage them. God &s;ays, his people &s;hall not do &s;o and &s;o, becau&s;e at their fir&s;t &s;etting out they would be di&s;heartned, and think of going back. It is our happine&s;s God lets us know our trials but very little be|fore-hand, very little notice of them have we before the time, and then, perhaps, gives us but little re&s;pite; but O when one trial is gone, God does with us as ma&s;ters do with

their &s;cholars, turns over a new leaf with us; and when one trial is over, teaches us another; hence our trials are not only new, but con|&s;tant; hence many a believer is apt to &s;ay, <HI>My trials ri&s;e out of the ground;</HI> and many be|lievers are &s;aying, who would have thought &s;uch a trial would have befallen me at &s;uch a time, from &s;uch a hand? this may, perhaps, open to us a gloomy &s;cene; it would be gloomy indeed, if we were not living in a &s;tate of pre|paration; it would be gloomy indeed, if God was to afflict without a cau&s;e; but there is &s;o much corruption, &s;uch remainders of indwell|ing &s;in, even in God's own children that are to &s;tand neare&s;t to him in glory, that are the deare&s;t to him, and who are to be ble&s;&s;ed with being in his bo&s;om, that if God was not to &s;end them afflictions, there is not a child of God but would over&s;et even with the comforts God vouch&s;afes to them. We find it &s;o with our bodies, that if we live without exerci&s;e we are liable to have a variety of di&s;ea&s;es, we therefore &s;ubmit to various ways and means that a phy&s;ician can pre&s;cribe; and if the di&s;|orders to which we are expo&s;ed in our bodies, make us willing to &s;ubmit to a regimen pre|&s;cribed by a &s;kilful phy&s;ician, does it not fol|low by a parity of rea&s;oning, that we for our &s;ouls want &s;ometimes lenitives, and corro&s;ives, and &s;omething like a cau&s;tic to eat off the proud fle&s;h that cleaves to us? and it vindicates God's ways to man, that there is an hereafter appointed for us, that there is another world, to which, perhaps, we &s;hall be called to go be|fore

Mr. Bohem, who was chaplain to the prince of Denmark, that was married to queen Anne, in one of his excellent &s;ermons upon affliction, has this ob&s;ervation, "Afflic|tions and temptations are like &s;un-beams fall|ing upon a dunghill; they do not bring va|pours into the dunghill, but they exhale the vapours." So afflictions do not bring the cor|ruptions into us; we blame &s;uch and &s;uch a one for &s;tirring up &s;uch and &s;uch corruptions in us, but the&s;e tend to draw out the vapours, and prepare us for the more la&s;ting &s;un&s;hine of a &s;miling God. God does not intend to de&s;troy thee, but to refine thee, and to hum|ble thee by it. The devil wants to &s;ift thee as wheat; he thinks to let the grain go through the &s;ieve, but Chri&s;t will only let the chaff fall through, and the &s;ooner that is gone the bet|ter: &s;o it is no ways derogatory to the honor of Chri&s;t, but agreeable to the &s;tate in which we are, agreeable to the &s;tate and the prepara|tions

to be made for eternity, agreeable to the militant di&s;po&s;ition that our graces mu&s;t retain. Hence our Lord was content to be called God's &s;ervant, <HI>Behold my &s;ervant whom I have cho&s;en, mine elect in whom my &s;oul delighteth.&mdash;Though he was a &s;on, he learned obedience by the things that he &s;uffered;</HI> he was made perfect by his &s;ufferings. We cannot avoid trouble as men, as chri&s;tians we &s;hould not attempt it: <HI>man is born to trouble as the &s;parks fly upwards:</HI> and chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially the man new-born. <HI>If the&s;e things were done to the green tree, what &s;hall be done to the dry?</HI> The cro&s;s is the high|road to heaven, and &s;o the king's highway: you know there is always a bar upon the king's road, the king has a particular road for him|&s;elf; but the King of kings will make all bars to be removed, and then his people go the &s;ame road he him&s;elf went: this was the road of all the children of God; there is not an heir of God in heaven, but is now thanking God for his &s;ufferings here below; there is not a child of God ever received into glory, but, I believe, as &s;oon as he comes there, is made to know why he met with &s;uch a trial, and from &s;uch a quarter; why he was under &s;uch a rod, why under it &s;o long; why it was &s;hift|ed, why it was changed, why the whip &s;ome|times was turned to a &s;corpion, and the furnace heated &s;even times hotter; then the believer &s;ees the need of it: in heaven, it makes him wonder he was not afflicted &s;even times more on earth.

Daniel is generally painted young, but he was four-&s;core years old when he was thrown in among the lions, there he &s;its as &s;weet and ea&s;y, and no lion dare to touch one of his grey hairs. Nothing proves the truth of grace, and &s;hows the love of God more, and you may be a&s;&s;ured of it as you are of being in this place alive, that &s;anctified afflictions are the greate&s;t evidence God can give you of his love; &s;o that if we are cho&s;en in the furnace of af|fliction, we are to expect it; and is it not a great &s;hame for us, that the heathens out-do us? when one came and told one of the heath|ens that his &s;on, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;on, was dead, he &s;aid, "I know that I begot him mortal."

<BIBL>ISAIAH lx. ver. 19, 20.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The &s;un &s;hall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightne&s;s &s;hall the moon give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> thee, but the Lord &s;hall be unto thee an ever|la&s;ting light, and thy God thy glory.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UPON reading the&s;e words, I cannot help thinking of what the royal P&s;almi&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Glorious things are &s;poken of thee, O city of God. Selah.</HI> I am afraid, my dear hearers, that even believers them&s;elves, who have ta&s;ted of the grace of God, reflect not and meditate as they ought, on the glorious and amazing felicity they are called by the Spirit of God to experience in this life. We content our|&s;elves too much with our hopes, and if we at|tain to <HI>a good hope through grace,</HI> we are ready to think we have got up to the la&s;t &s;tep of the
<PB N="145" REF="033217_0152_0FF68F66604F8BA0">
go&s;pel ladder, and have nothing more to do but to re&s;t in that hope, without ever attain|ing to an abiding, full a&s;&s;urance of faith. If we would examine the &s;criptures, and not chu&s;e to bring them down to us, but beg of God to rai&s;e our hearts up to them, we &s;hall find the believer is made partaker of the grace of life, as well as an heir of it; the one is on earth, the other in heaven, and one is only a prelibation of the other. This ble&s;&s;ed prophet I&s;aiah, &s;peaking of the privileges of the chil|dren of God, &s;aith, <HI>Eve hath not &s;een, nor ear heard&punc; neither hath it entered into the heart of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> conceive the things that God hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> (that even here below) <HI>for tho&s;e that love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&punc;</HI> God grant that we may be of that happy number! Hence, like an evangeli&s;t, the prophet draws a&s;ide the veil, and as one in&s;pir|ed by the &s;pirit of God, and filled with the rays of divine light, gives us a tran&s;porting view of the go&s;pel &s;tate, and the glory which the church militant enjoys below, before its triumphant &s;tate above.</P>
<P>The text, probably, refers to the great change that &s;hould be made in the affairs of the Jews after their captivity, how wonderfully God would appear for them, after their harps had been long hanging on the willows, and they could make no other an&s;wer to their in|&s;ulting foes than this mournful one, <HI>How can we &s;ing the Lord's &s;ong in a &s;trange land?</HI> The go&s;pel is, doubtle&s;s, glad tidings of great joy; and however the people of God might be en|couraged to hope that the time would come,
<PB N="146" REF="033217_0153_0FF68F69E829B148">
when they &s;hould tread on the necks of their enemies, the prophet teaches them to look further, and lets them know that their happi|ne&s;s was not to con&s;i&s;t in any external created good, but in a larger po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the graces and comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t. So that this chapter &s;peaks not only of a temporal de|liverance and re&s;t, which they &s;hould enjoy after their trouble, but a &s;piritual re&s;t, which, by faith, they &s;hould enter into here, as the earne&s;t and pledge of the re&s;t and enjoyment of the better world hereafter. As we know no more of heaven than is di&s;covered by the eye of faith, for even St. Paul acknow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">es, that the things he &s;aw were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> ob&s;ervable that heaven in &s;cripture is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to us more by what it is not, than by what it is. So in the words of the text, <HI>Thy &s;un &s;hall no more go down, neither &s;hall thy moon withdraw it&s;elf, for the Lord &s;hall be thine everla&s;ting light, and the days of thy mourning &s;hall be ended.</HI> Here are three negatives, and but one po&s;itive, namely, <HI>the Lord &s;hall be thy everla&s;ting light,</HI> which is a beautiful allu&s;ion to the &s;un, that &s;hould teach us to &s;piritualize natural things; and if we feared God, and lived near to him as we ought, there is no object of our bodily eyes but might improve our &s;piritual &s;ight. You cannot &s;uppo&s;e the prophet meant a time &s;hould come, when the &s;un &s;hould not literal|ly go down, that there &s;hould not be night and day as now; God indeed permitted a man once to &s;ay, <HI>&s;un, &s;tand thou &s;till,</HI> and it was done; but, perhaps, there never will be any &s;uch

doubting people will not take hold of that, and &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I am in a doubting &s;tate, and I am content.

<P>Sometimes, in&s;tead of the &s;un there is only moon-light, which &s;hews the difference a be|liever feels in his &s;oul, both in relation to grace and comfort. Both &s;un and moon give light, but O how far &s;uperior is the one to the other: the moon gives a very faint, uncertain light, waxes and wanes, and at be&s;t is almo&s;t nothing when compared with the light, and the ble&s;&s;ed reviving heat of the &s;un. Hence, my brethren, this world &s;ometimes is a world of mourners: it is &s;aid, <HI>that the days of our mourning &s;hall be ended;</HI> for if the text refers to the future &s;tate, as no doubt it does, it means that the days of believers here below are very often mournful, trying, and afflicting, though they end in joy, as our Lord intimates in his opening his go&s;pel-&s;ermon almo&s;t with the&s;e very words, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn, for they &s;hall be comforted.</HI> Some, perhaps, may think it is an odd kind of ble&s;&s;ing; and though worldly people are fond of the fifth of Matthew, and wonder that Methodi&s;ts and go&s;pel-mini&s;ters do not preach oftener on that chapter, I am apt to believe, when you come
<PB N="150" REF="033217_0157_0FF68F74775344E0">
to preach and open that word, they will not like that chapter any more than any other, becau&s;e they are for a joyful Chri&s;t, and not for any mourning at all. Do you know God in Chri&s;t? let me tell you, the more you are acquainted with him, the more your &s;ouls will be kept in a mourning &s;tate. A mournful &s;tate!&mdash;O, &s;ay you, people will mourn before they are converted.&mdash;Ah, that they will.&mdash;I don't love to hear of conver&s;ions without any &s;ecret mourning; I &s;eldom &s;ee &s;uch &s;ouls e&s;tabli&s;hed. I have heard of a per&s;on who was in company once with fourteen mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, &s;ome of whom were eminent &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, and yet not one of them could tell the time God fir&s;t manife&s;ted him|&s;elf to their &s;oul. Zaccheus's was a very quick conver&s;ion, perhaps not a quarter of an hour's conviction: this I mention, that we may not condemn one another. We do not love the pope, becau&s;e we love to be popes our&s;elves, and &s;et up our own experience as a &s;tandard to others. Tho&s;e that had &s;uch a conver&s;ion as the jaylor, or the Jews: O, &s;ay you, we do not like to hear you talk of &s;haking over hell, we love to hear of conver&s;ion by the love of God; while others that were &s;o &s;haken, as Mr. Bolton and other eminent men were, may &s;ay, you are not chri&s;tians becau&s;e you had not the like terrible experience. You may as well &s;ay to your neighbour, you have not had a child, for you were not in labour all night. The que&s;tion is, whether a real child is born, not how long was the preceding pain,
<PB N="151" REF="033217_0158_0FF68F766C2F95A0">
but whether it was productive of a new birth, and whether Chri&s;t has been formed in your hearts; it is the birth proves the reality of the thing.</P>
<P>Some allow that there is mourning before, but no mourning after conver&s;ion; pray who &s;ays &s;o? none but an Antinomian, a rank An|tinomian; and when you hear a per&s;on &s;ay, that after conver&s;ion you will have no mourn|ing, you may be a&s;&s;ured that per&s;on is at be&s;t walking by moon-light; he does not walk by the &s;un, he has got &s;ome doctrine in his head, but very little grace, I am afraid, in his heart. How! how! my brethren, not mourn after we are converted; why, till then there is no true mourning at all. The damned in hell are mourning now, they put on their mourn|ing as &s;oon as they get there. How am I tor|mented in this flame, &s;ays Dives; and Cain, my puni&s;hment is greater than I can bear. How many worldly people break their hearts for the lo&s;s of the world: they cannot keep their u&s;ual equipage, nor do as they would; and come not to wor&s;hip on Sunday, becau&s;e they cannot appear &s;o fine as formerly they did: this is a &s;orrow of the world that work|eth death; but there is a ble&s;&s;ed, a more evan|gelical mourning, which is the habitual, ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate and frame of a converted &s;oul. How &s;trong the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>They &s;hall look on him whom they have pierced, and &s;hall mourn:</HI> how &s;hall they mourn? <HI>as one mourneth for a fir&s;t|born, an only child.</HI> Have you ever been call|ed to bury a child? is there any tender moth|er
<PB N="152" REF="033217_0159_0FF68F78C3783EA0">
here? were you merry directly after the child was dead? no, perhaps till this very day, you continually call to remembrance your lit|tle one and &s;hed a tear; every thing relating to it, cau&s;es the repetition of your &s;orrow. When a poor believer is acquainted with Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, he mourns for having crucified the Son of God, and you will mourn for the &s;ame &s;in after conver&s;ion as before. Surely, &s;ays &s;ome, I mourn for my &s;ins I committed before my conver&s;ion. I do not know whether you do or no, but I know you &s;hould. O, &s;ays David, <HI>Remember not again&s;t me the &s;ins of my youth,</HI> in a P&s;alm which was wrote when he was an old man; and Paul &s;ays, <HI>I was a bla&s;|phemer and injurious, and therefore not worthy to be called an apo&s;tle, becau&s;e I per&s;ecuted the church of God;</HI> and this after he had been wrapped up to the third heaven. See Mary ru&s;hing into the hou&s;e, wa&s;hing her Lord's feet with her tears, and wiping them with her hair: I don't &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed as our ladies are now; they did not make &s;uch apes of them|&s;elves; but her hair was very fine in an hon|e&s;t way: though &s;he breaks the alliba&s;ter box of ointment given her, perhaps by &s;ome poor &s;illy creature that would die by her frowns, and live upon her &s;miles, &s;ee her at the feet of her Saviour, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t an&s;wers for her, &s;ome having thought &s;he was profu&s;e, that having had much forgiven, &s;he loved much. The more the love of God is manife&s;ted, the more it will melt the &s;oul down: I appeal to you chri&s;tians, whether the &s;weete&s;t times you
<PB N="153" REF="033217_0160_0FF68F7AF804C260">
ever enjoyed, were not tho&s;e when you were much melted at the &s;ight of a crucified Savi|our; when you could &s;ay, Lord, thou forgav|e&s;t me, I fell it, I know it, but I cannot for|give my&s;elf; this will always be the effect of an engenuous mind; and a per&s;on that is really converted will thus mourn, and if you do not know this, you may be a&s;&s;ured you know noth|ing &s;avingly of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. You may go and hear this and that warning, and you are right to gather honey from every flower, but you have not got within the inner court, but are yet without. God give you to &s;ee your folly herein.</P>
<P>A true believer will mourn over his corrup|tions: I wonder what they can think, who &s;uppo&s;e they have no corruptions. I remem|ber a poor creature of Rhode-I&s;land, who looked the mo&s;t like the old Puritans I ever &s;aw, when I was talking with him, and &s;aid, &s;ome people &s;ay there are &s;ome men that have no &s;in; he &s;aid, if you &s;end &s;uch a man to me, I will pay his charges even from England and back again. I have often learned &s;omething from the difference of gla&s;&s;es: you look into the common gla&s;&s;es, and &s;ee your&s;elves there &s;o fine, and admire your per&s;on, dre&s;s, &amp;c. but when you view your&s;elves through a mi|cro&s;cope, how many worms are di&s;covered in that fine &s;kin of yours, enough to make you a&s;hamed of the vermin and filth that is &s;eated there: &s;o it is in faith, that gla&s;s would &s;how you &s;o much corruption cleaving to every ac|tion of your lives, that would make you &s;in|&s;ick,
<PB N="154" REF="033217_0161_0FF68F7E8F327CD8">
and mourn that you have known God &s;o long, and are like him &s;o little. What &s;ays Paul? <HI>Who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> Notwith&s;tanding he knew that <HI>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> yet cries out, <HI>O wretched man that I am!</HI> I &s;hould have thought, O happy man that thou art! formerly a per&s;ecutor, and now a preacher; a man that has been honored &s;o much above every man in planting churches, which is the highe&s;t honor a man can have un|der heaven; here is a man that hath been wrapt up to the third heaven,&mdash;what of him? <HI>O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from this body of &s;in and death?</HI> Do you think that it was only a little qualm of con&s;cience? no, it was the habitual temper of his heart. Some people are much humbled by fits and &s;tarts, but Paul felt this daily: many things that we are not concerned about, Paul looked upon them as &s;uch that made his heart ach, becau&s;e he thought he could not live near enough to God. He not only watched to do good, but he watched how he did that good; and nature was &s;o mixed with it, that he &s;aid, I cannot do as I would do, I would have &s;erv|ed God like an angel, but I find my&s;elf to be a poor &s;inner after all; and if we are like|minded with Paul, we &s;hall mourn over our corruptions, we &s;hall mourn over our hidden &s;ins that none know but God and our&s;elves. It is a very dangerous thing to tru&s;t go&s;pel-go&s;&s;ips, who being &s;trangers to them&s;elves, hear with wonder and contempt, and often
<PB N="155" REF="033217_0162_0FF68F8133985FC0">
betray; however, a judicious friend, into who&s;e bo&s;om we can pour out our &s;ouls, and tell our corruptions as well as our comforts, is a very great privilege. When our corruptions do not drive us from Chri&s;t, but drive us to him, it is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing to commune with Chri&s;t on this &s;ide heaven: and, my brethren, if your hearts are right with God, you will &s;ee &s;uch things as nobody el&s;e could think of. A good woman who was charmed with Dr. Manton, &s;aid, O, &s;ir, you have made an excellent &s;ermon to-day, I wi&s;h I had your heart; do you &s;ay &s;o, &s;aid he, good woman, you had better not wi&s;h for it, for if you had it, you would wi&s;h for your own again. The be&s;t of men &s;ee them&s;elves in the wor&s;t light.</P>
<P>How many thou&s;and things are there that make you mourn here below! who can tell the tears that godly parents &s;hed for ungodly children! O you young folks, you don't know what plague your children may be to you! O they are pretty things while young, like rattle|&s;nakes and alligators, which I have &s;een when little, but put them in your bo&s;om and you will find they are dangerous. How many are there in the world that would wi&s;h, if it were lawful, that God had written them childle&s;s: there is many a poor creature that makes his father's heart ach. I once a&s;ked a godly wi|dow, madam, how is your &s;on; &s;he turned a&s;ide with tears, and &s;aid, &s;ir, he is no &s;on to me now. What in the world can come up to that! here, &s;ays one, I have bred up my chil|dren, I cannot charge my&s;elf with educating
<PB N="156" REF="033217_0163_0FF68FF3567DC060">
them wrong, though few parents can &s;ay that, for many parents lead them into the paths of death, and &s;o are murderers of their own chil|dren, and by their manner of education help to damn them for ever; but if you can &s;ay, I have done all I could, and yet, O my God, my children are wor&s;e than any other peoples; this is a dreadful &s;tate indeed; and the more you mourn, the more they laugh at you; O the&s;e are my godly parents. They increa&s;e their trouble, like Dr. Horneck's &s;on, who &s;aid, <HI>There is not a po&s;t in my father's hou&s;e but &s;tinks of piety.</HI> I once &s;aw a man that was awakened at the Orphan-hou&s;e, fall down and throw him&s;elf on one of their beds, crying out, O, &s;ir, what will become of my poor grey headed father, who knows nothing of this birth! It is a difficulty with &s;ome to know how to behave towards unconverted relations; if you don't go to them, they will &s;ay you are preci&s;e; if you do, and are faithful, they will &s;oon &s;how you they have enough of your com|pany: this &s;ends a godly per&s;on home mourn|ing; and then there comes a thought, &s;hall I &s;peak to them any more, or let them go to the devil. This is not like parting from your friends by death, but burying them alive: when dead we know we mu&s;t &s;ubmit, but to part from friends, tho&s;e we loved, and thought to have lived with till we came to heaven, is mournful indeed.</P>
<P>Moreover, the poor &s;tate of the church makes many a mini&s;ter and clo&s;e-walker with God to weep over the de&s;olations of the &s;anc|tuary,
<PB N="157" REF="033217_0164_0FF68FF5CCE05B30">
and to mourn for tho&s;e that will not mourn for them&s;elves: thus our Lord wept over Jeru&s;alem, <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, how often would I have gathered thy children, as a hen gathereth her chickens,</HI> but it is over with thee now; the decree is gone forth, and Je|ru&s;alem &s;hall &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Brethren, the time will fail and therefore I leave it to you to &s;upply more ca&s;es; for if I was to preach till to-morrow morning, I doubt not but a thou&s;and here would &s;ay, there are many things you have not mentioned yet. You know the &s;tate of your own hearts, and the many particular trials in your own ca&s;e; and you may al&s;o know, though your trial &s;eems over, it is only changed: but let it be ob&s;erved, the day of your mourning &s;hall be ended; mind, it is but days, though &s;ometimes made very &s;ad ones indeed, by the neglect and ingratitude of tho&s;e who have made the peo|ple of God &s;erve them with rigour, as though all the world was made for them, as well as their incapacity to help them&s;elves, by poverty, pain, &s;ore &s;ickne&s;&s;es, and of long continuance. This has been, and is the lot of many a child of God; ble&s;&s;ed be &s;overeign mercy 'tis but a few days. An end &s;hall arrive, and that end &s;hall be happy, when death, the believer's friend, &s;hall come with an angel's face, to di&s;|mi&s;s them from all their &s;in and &s;orrow. When I was la&s;t at Bri&s;tol, I could not help remem|bring good Mr. Middleton, who u&s;ed, you know to have the gout very much, and in that clo&s;et were kept his crutches: now,
<PB N="158" REF="033217_0165_0FF68FF8841A8980">
thought I, he needs them no more, the days of his mourning are ended, and &s;o &s;hall ours by and by too, when we &s;hall no longer want our &s;piritual crutches or armour, but &s;hall &s;ay to the helmet of hope, the &s;hield of faith, I have no more need of thee; and the all-pre|vailing weapon of prayer be changed into &s;ongs of endle&s;s prai&s;e; when God him&s;elf &s;hall be our everla&s;ting light, a &s;un that &s;hall never go down more, but &s;hall beam forth his infinite and eternal love in a beatific &s;tate for ever. The pro&s;pect of this made one of the fathers cry out, O glory! how great! how great! what art thou? a friend a&s;king him what he &s;aw? he an&s;wered, I &s;ee the glory of the only begotten Son of God. And if a &s;ight of Chri&s;t on earth is &s;o great, as could make good Mr. Wardrobe, an excellent Scotch mini&s;ter &s;ay, after he was given over, &s;tarting up in the arms of an excellent friend who told it me, in a rapture of joy, crowns! crowns! crowns of glory &s;hall adorn this head of mine e'er long! and &s;tretching up, added, palms! palms! palms &s;hall e'er long fill the&s;e hands of mine! and &s;o &s;weetly fell a&s;leep in Je&s;us: what a plea&s;ing, awful trial is that for an affectionate friend! So our dear &s;i&s;ter, who is to be buried to-morrow night at Totten|ham-court, talked with her friends for an hour or two, and took leave of her hu&s;band and children, and &s;aid, Now come, ye heavenly chariots! We &s;hall thank God then for all our lo&s;&s;es, cro&s;&s;es, and di&s;appointments; and I believe tho&s;e things which we mourn for

mo&s;t, and puts us mo&s;t to the trial, will give us mo&s;t comfort when we come to die: God &s;hall be our everla&s;ting light, as well as the days of our mourning &s;hall be ended.</P>
<P>Take care, don't be &s;ecure, pray don't think the day of your mourning to be ended yet: you may put off mourning for your friends, but may have fre&s;h cau&s;e of mourn|ing for your &s;ouls; whil&s;t you remember that holy mourning is con&s;i&s;tent with holy walking, following the Lord in all his ways. You have often heard me &s;peak of one of our mini&s;ters, who was not one of your fine velvet mouths, that &s;aid once in the pulpit, As &s;ure as you &s;ee the &s;un &s;hine on my brea&s;t, which at that time it did, &s;o &s;ure does the Spirit of God dwell in the &s;ouls of true believers. How oft|en has he told you, <HI>I am for having you have godly &s;orrow, I wi&s;h your hearts were full of it, becau&s;e it will end in everla&s;ting joy.</HI> Comfort, my brethren, one another with the&s;e things the day of your mourning &s;hall &s;oon be ended for ever.</P>
<P>But what am I to &s;ay? I apprehend I &s;hall grow forgetful to-night;&mdash;I have &s;poken &s;o much to &s;aints, I am afraid I &s;hall have but little time to &s;peak to &s;inners: I mean, I have taken &s;o much time up in &s;peaking to you that know God, that I have but little to &s;peak to you that know him not. How different you &s;tate, poor hearts! poor hearts! my &s;oul mourns for you; my blood, whil&s;t I am &s;peak|ing, is ready to curdle in my veins. The &s;e|raphic Mr. Hervey, when he did me that

honor to &s;o-journ under my roof, &s;aid, My dear friend, it is an awful thing when we &s;ee an unconverted man die, and his eyes clo&s;ed, to think, that that poor &s;oul will never &s;ee one gleam of comfort or life more; to have a &s;ight of God, of Chri&s;t, and the heavenly angels and &s;aints; but to &s;ee what the rich man &s;aw, a God they want; to &s;ee Lazarus, whom he would not permit to be &s;een at his door, now taken particular notice of in heaven; and to &s;ee him&s;elf now a beggar in hell. The Lord help you to think! O think how &s;oon your &s;un will go down, and even your bodies will feel damnation, not only in re&s;pect to pain, but lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop U&s;her's opinion was, and I heartily concur in it, that tho&s;e who value them&s;elves mo&s;t on their beauty and dre&s;s, and do not love God on earth, will be mo&s;t deformed in hell, and their bodies &s;uffer proportionally there. There is no dre&s;&s;ing in hell, nothing but fire and brim&s;tone there, and the wrath of God always awaiting on thee, O &s;inner, who|ever thou art, man or woman. It was a fine &s;aying of Maclane, who was executed &s;ome years ago, when the cap was pulling over his eyes, mu&s;t I never &s;ee the light of yon &s;un any more; Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thou &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s, ari&s;e with healing under thy wings on my departing &s;oul! May the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t do that for us all! When you are damned, the days of your mourning will be but at their beginning; there is no end of your mourning in hell. There is but one

Believers, pray for them: Lord help you, &s;inners, to pray for your vile &s;elves. Some may think, what do you cry for? why, I cry for you. Perhaps you will &s;ay as a wicked one did to a poor wo|man in Scotland, when thou&s;ands were awak|ened there; &s;eeing her weep, he &s;aid, what do you weep for? for this people, &s;ays &s;he; weep for your&s;elf, &s;ays he; &s;he replied, I do; but what is my &s;oul, to all the&s;e poor &s;ouls!

good natural, as well as acquired abilities, which being tempered by the Holy Gho&s;t, made him a kind of an angel of an orator, of a writer, and a prophet. When he penned this chapter, he probably fore&s;aw the dreadful calamities coming on the land; and &s;o &s;trong was his per&s;ua&s;ion, that he writes as though he &s;aw the things taking place. <HI>Behold,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Lord maketh the earth empty, maketh it wa&s;te, and turneth it up&s;ide down, and &s;cattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.</HI> How much is expre&s;&s;ed in a few words! <HI>As with the people &s;o with the prie&s;ts,</HI> who perhaps on account of their &s;ituation in the church, might think they &s;hould be exempted; but if the prie&s;ts &s;in with the people they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with the people. <HI>As with the &s;ervant, &s;o with his ma&s;ter; as with the maid, &s;o with her mi&s;|tre&s;s; as with the buyer, &s;o with the &s;eller; as with the lender, &s;o with the borrower; as with the taker of u&s;ury, &s;o with the giver of u&s;ury to him.</HI> So you &s;ee that the vi&s;itation would be univer&s;al; that it &s;hould fall on all forts of people.

So God will take care of his people, that they &s;hall be &s;afe: pray look to ver. 14, <HI>they &s;hall lift up their voice;</HI> what to cry? no, they have done with prayers, they have done with fa&s;t|ing; they have lifted up their voice, and oft|en exhorted their neighbours to <HI>flee from the wrath to come;</HI> but now they &s;hall &s;ing for the maje&s;ty of God; when all people are mourn|ing, they &s;hall rejoice.

<P>The words imply, in order to bring them home to our&s;elves, that all God's people mu&s;t be put into the fires.

fire after another, which makes me love to &s;ee a good man under afflictions, becau&s;e it teach|es &s;omething of the work of God in the heart. I remember &s;ome years ago, when I fir&s;t preached in the north of England, at Shields near Newca&s;tle, I went into a gla&s;s-hou&s;e, and &s;tanding very attentive, I &s;aw &s;everal ma&s;&s;es of burning gla&s;s of various forms: the workman took one piece of gla&s;s and put it into one fur|nace, then he put it into a &s;econd, and then into a third: when I a&s;ked him, why do you put this into &s;o many fires? he an&s;wered, O, &s;ir, the fir&s;t was not hot enough, nor the &s;econd, and there|fore we put it into the third, and that will make it tran&s;parent. Taking leave of him in a proper manner, it occurred to me, this would make a good &s;ermon: O, thought I, does this man put this gla&s;s into one furnace after a|nother, that we may &s;ee through it; O may God put me into one furnace after another, that my &s;oul may be tran&s;parent; that I may &s;ee God as he is. My brethren, we need to be purged; how apt are we to want to go to heaven upon a feather-bed; many go lying upon beds of pain and langui&s;hing, which is the King's highway thither. You know there are &s;ome ways in London called the King's road, and they are finely gravelled, but the King's road to heaven is &s;trowed with cro&s;&s;es and afflictions. We are all apt to think well of being chri&s;tians; it is very pretty talking of being chri&s;tians, till we are put into one furnace after another; <HI>think it not &s;trange,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>concerning the fiery trial which is to

try you.</HI> What mu&s;t I do? why, &s;ince I mu&s;t be in the fire, I mu&s;t thank my corruptions for it; God will not put you or me into the fire if there was not &s;omething to be purged away; the grand thing is to learn to glorify God in the fire. <HI>Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires.</HI></P>
<P>When do we glorify him? when we endea|vour to get &s;uch grace from the Lord, that we may not di&s;honor him when we are under the cro&s;s, and therefore we glorify God in the fire when we quietly endure it as a cha&s;ti&s;e|ment for our &s;ins: If you keep watch now, and live near to God, you will never find that you are put into a fire, but you fir&s;t brought your&s;elves into it; and I do verily believe from my heart, that our &s;in is always to be &s;een in our puni&s;hment. If any of you part from a child that he loves dearly, upon examination he will &s;ay, I find now the creature's gone, that the ivy twined too much about the oak; and then he turns off: ah! &s;ays he, God has met with me now. And you will find in all the Old and New Te&s;tament, that the afflictions of God's people were &s;uitable to their faults: Jacob was over per&s;uaded by his mother to get the ble&s;&s;ing by a lie; but he was a &s;imple-hearted poor creature. Some per&s;ons think nothing of a lie; if they can but get by it, they do not mind it; but an hone&s;t man will &s;hun it. Jacob argues with his mother again&s;t it; O, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>the cur&s;e be on me, my &s;on!</HI> O dreadful! for a good woman to &s;ay &s;o.
<PB N="172" REF="033217_0179_0FF690171B0F5E40">
Doubtle&s;s &s;he was per&s;uaded God would give Jacob the ble&s;&s;ing, but &s;he took a wrong way to obtain it; &s;he might have waited for the ble&s;&s;ing to come with a ble&s;&s;ing. How did God puni&s;h Jacob? why, in a night afterwards poor Jacob was impo&s;ed upon by a wrong wife, he got a Leah in&s;tead of a Rachel; the poor creature was impo&s;ed upon there, and &s;o all along almo&s;t to the end of his life; he had a furnace of affliction. Happy they who pray in the furnace, Lord, let me know why thou do&s;t contend with me. Therefore God &s;ends this me&s;&s;age to Ely by Samuel, <HI>the thing that thou knowe&s;t,</HI> &s;eems to me to refer to his too great lenity to his &s;ons: <HI>the thing that thou knowe&s;t;</HI> thou do&s;t not act like a magi&s;trate.

<P>We glorify God in the fire when we bear it patiently. It is a dreadful thing when we are &s;aying with Cain, <HI>My puni&s;hment is greater than I can bear;</HI> but the language of a &s;oul that glorifies God in the fire is this, &s;hall I, Lord, &s;hall I a &s;inful man, complain for the puni&s;hment of my &s;ins? It is a glorious thing when we can &s;ay with a good man, one of who&s;e particular friends told me more than once, that when he was racked with pain, and groaning all night with trouble, he would oft|en &s;ay, Lord, I groan; Lord, I groan; Lord, I groan; but, Lord Je&s;us, I appeal to thee,

thou knowe&s;t I do not grumble. Then we glorify God in the fire, when, though we feel pain and angui&s;h, we at the &s;ame time &s;ay, Lord, we de&s;erve this and ten thou&s;and times more.</P>
<P>We glorify God in the fire al&s;o, when we are really and fully per&s;uaded, God will not put us in the fire but for our good, and his own glory. I am afraid &s;ome people think God does, as &s;ome cheating apothecaries, that bring five things when they need not bring but one, e&s;pecially when they have &s;ome &s;illy patients that love to be taking phy&s;ic; they &s;end one after another, when, perhaps, the be&s;t thing would be to throw them all away; &s;o we think of God, but it is a mi&s;take; he nev|er &s;ends one but what is nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ome|thing to be purged away.</P>
<P>We glorify God in the fire when we &s;ay, Lord, don't let the fire go out till it has purg|ed away all my dro&s;s.

<P>You glorify God in the fire when you are not grumbling, but humbly &s;ubmitting to his will; a humble &s;pirit walks not in &s;ulkine&s;s and &s;tubbornne&s;s: there are &s;ome &s;pirits too &s;tout, they will not &s;peak. When that awful me&s;&s;age was brought to Ely, what does he &s;ay? <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what &s;eemeth him good;</HI> let my children be killed, whatever be done it is the Lord's doing; only, Lord, &s;ave my &s;oul at la&s;t.</P>
<P>We glorify God in the fire, when in the mid&s;t of the fire we can &s;ing God's high prai&s;es. Thus the children of I&s;rael glorified the Lord; the &s;ong of the three children in the fiery fur|nace is a &s;weet &s;ong; as are all that are made in the fire. <HI>O all the works of the Lord, prai&s;e and magnify him for ever!</HI> Then we glorify God in the fire when we rejoice in him, when we not only think but know it be&s;t, and can thank God for &s;triking us; can thank God for whipping us; can ble&s;s God for not letting us alone: thank God for not &s;aying, <HI>let him alone:</HI> this is to glorify God in the fire. <HI>Not only &s;o,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>but we glory in tribula|tion, knowing that tribulation worketh patience.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, we glorify the Lord in the fire when we have in exerci&s;e, patience, meekne&s;s, humility; learning more to di&s;tru&s;t our&s;elves,

having a deeper knowledge of our own weak|ne&s;s, and of God's omnipotence and grace. Happy when we can look back and &s;ay, thus have I been enabled to glorify God in the fire.

<P>My brethren, let us humble our&s;elves to|night, and let us be a&s;hamed and aba&s;hed be|fore God, and wonder he has not &s;truck us into hell when we have been complaining the fire was too hot, that God &s;ent us not to the devil.

the reformation: great pains have been taken to blacken the reformers, and to make it believed that a reformation could not be good that was begun by people of bad charac|ter, and a king of an immoral life. But &s;o far is this from eclip&s;ing, that it illu&s;trates the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of divine Providence, in obliging the wicked to do what they never de&s;igned, and over-ruling their coun&s;els for the fulfilling God's holy, wi&s;e, and &s;overeign decree. This ob&s;ervation naturally ari&s;es from the words of our text, which were &s;poken by, as far as I can judge, one of the vile&s;t men upon the earth, you doubtle&s;s know his name, Balaam, who, though florid in his expre&s;&s;ions, and high in profe&s;&s;ion of intercour&s;e with God, and puts on a fine face of religion, was but a rotten-hearted hypocrite, for he divined for money, made a trade of religion; and &s;o lov|ed the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, as to have wi&s;hed to cur&s;e even tho&s;e whom God had ble&s;&s;ed.

A|chilles, the Graecian hero, is &s;aid to be capable of being wounded only in the heel, but bad prie&s;ts, mini&s;ters, and people, have a great deal more dangerous part to be wounded in, that is, the palm of the hand; if you can keep that &s;ecure from being wounded with gold, never fear; the devil can't have his end. Balak promi&s;ed him great preferment, if he

would but come and cur&s;e the people of God. A prophet, or &s;ooth&s;ayer, is one that pretends to have intercour&s;e with God or the devil, and Balak did not care by which of them it was, &s;o that he could but get the I&s;raelites cur&s;ed; Balaam catches at the golden bait, pretends to a&s;k coun&s;el of God; and what &s;eems &s;trange, God bids him go, and yet &s;ends an angel to meet him in the way, who &s;tands ready to &s;lay him for going. Does it not &s;eem very &s;trange, that God &s;hould bid a man go, and then &s;lay him for going; but people that read this pa&s;&s;age, &s;hould carefully mind the particulars of it. God &s;aid, if the men come and call thee, go; but he did not wait for that, but &s;addles his a&s;s and goes: this is called by St. Peter, the madne&s;s of the proph|et: witne&s;s his ri&s;ing early in the morning, not waiting for the call of the princes, which &s;hewed how eager he was to be gone; and though this &s;olution &s;hould not be allowed, God was ju&s;tly angry for his going with an ill de&s;ign, that is, maliciou&s;ly to cur&s;e a people whom he knew God re&s;olved &s;hould be ble&s;|&s;ed, and that for the &s;ake of the wages of un|righteou&s;ne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is no unu&s;ual thing in holy writ, for heaven to re&s;ent and pun|i&s;h even tho&s;e actions that it has permitted.

without God's leave: however, no co&s;t is &s;pared to obtain the end; &s;o true is it, that the devil's children are ten thou&s;and times more expen&s;ive in per&s;ecuting the people of God, than God's people are in promoting his glory. This &s;ooth&s;aying prie&s;t pretends to go to God, which is permitted, but forced to &s;peak what God would have him; once and again his mouth is &s;topped, or rather his cur&s;es are &s;topped and turned into a ble&s;|&s;ing. Balak, enraged at his repeated di&s;|appointment, bids him neither to cur&s;e or ble&s;s them at all; and thinking, perhaps, that the &s;ight of the people affected him, carries him to a place where he would &s;ee but a &s;mall part of them; he goes, and there God made him confirm the ble&s;&s;ing in&s;tead of the cur&s;e, more abundantly than before.

<P>Now, my brethren, if God has wrought this in us, what &s;hall I &s;ay? why, I pray the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t that your life and mine may be a life of prai&s;e. I would have you not only dwell upon particular words of God &s;et home upon your hearts, but his various providences, the numerous trials he has brought you through: O think how often you have been kept, think how often you would have run away from God if he had not &s;topped you; what has God wrought, by delivering me from bla&s;phemous thoughts; what has God wrought, in &s;natching me out of the jaws of ruin; ev|en after conver&s;ion, when I was damning my own &s;oul, his grace arre&s;ted me. Have we brought our&s;elves into trials, how has he made the&s;e very trials work for good; made our &s;colding hu&s;bands and wives, per&s;ecuting fa|thers, friends and relations, that you have thought would devour you, made the bulls of Ba&s;han in&s;truments of bringing you nearer to God; and eternity will be too &s;hort to cry perpetually, <HI>what hath God wrought!</HI></P>
<P>And if God has not wrought this in any of you that are here, which perhaps, may be the ca&s;e though I cannot think what &s;hould bring any body here if they had not a de&s;ire of the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls; if God hath not wrought it in you yet, O that this may be

If we may a&s;k what God has wrought, let me a&s;k you what the devil hath wrought in you; O thou uncon|verted &s;oul, &s;in has made thee a bea&s;t, made thy body, which ought to be the temple of the living God, a cage of every unclean bird; what hath &s;atan wrought in thee? but made thee a ne&s;t of vile &s;tinking &s;wine; and what will he give thee? hell, hell, hell. The wa|ges the devil gives no man can live by; <HI>the wages of &s;in is death:</HI> and here I come to bring you good news, glad tidings of great joy; O that God may now counter-work the devil, and take thee into his own workman&s;hip, cre|ate thee anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, give thee to feel a little of his Spirit's work on thy heart, and make thee, of a child of the devil, a child of God! Say not, it cannot be; &s;ay not, it &s;hall not be; &s;ay not, it is too late; &s;ay not, it is for others but not for me; my brethren, God help you to cry, and to try to-night, if thou can&s;t turn the text into a prayer, Lord God, I have felt the devil work in me, now, good God, let me know what it is for thee to work in me; make me a new creature, create a new &s;pirit within me, that I may join with thy dear people in &s;inging, <HI>what hath God wrought!</HI> O remember, if this is not the ca&s;e with you, you mu&s;t have a dreadful different

<P>You that have this work begun in you, look &s;till for better things to come, even after death, when our bodies are made like Chri&s;t's glori|ous body, and our &s;ouls filled with the fulne&s;s of God, we &s;hall then cry, Churchmen and Di&s;&s;enters, Methodi&s;ts and Foundery-men, and the Lock too, we &s;hall all then join with|out any bickerings, &s;aying, <HI>what has God wrought!</HI></P>
<P>I could enlarge, but I am afraid I have been too long already; yet as I think the providence of God calls me, and I &s;hall give a particular account of my call to-morrow even|ing, at the other end of the town, I think if I &s;hould keep you a few minutes longer, it might be excu&s;ed.

<P>The chapter in which is our text, is an in|&s;tance of this. What a glorious day of the &s;on of man was that when Jo&s;eph &s;ent for his father to Egypt; and the good old patriarch, after he had thought his &s;on had been dead many years, agreeably &s;urprized by a me&s;&s;age from him to come to him, with all his family, and are by him comfortably &s;ettled in Go&s;hen; where the good old patriarch, after many a &s;tormy day, died in peace, and was highly honored at his funeral by Pharaoh and his &s;er|vants, and attended to the &s;epulchre of his fathers in Canaan by all his &s;ons. After which, Jo&s;eph continued to live in &s;plendor, lord of all the land of Egypt; and his brethren, doubtle&s;s, in the height of pro&s;perity: but how &s;adly did the &s;cene change at Pharaoh's death, &s;oon after which, <HI>another king aro&s;e that knew not Jo&s;eph,</HI> verifying the ob&s;ervation, New lords, new laws, by whom the de&s;cend|ants of Jacob, in&s;tead of reigning in Go&s;hen, were made bond-&s;laves; many, many long years, employed in making bricks, and in all probability, had what we call their bibles tak|en from them, by being forced to conform to the idolatry of Egypt, and &s;o were in a wor&s;e &s;tate than the unhappy Negroes in America are at this day. No doubt, numbers of them
<PB N="201" REF="033217_0208_0FF6905A52ED17C0">
either wondered that ever they had been pro&s;|pered at all, or that God had forgot them now; but what a mercy it is that <HI>a thou&s;and years in God's &s;ight are but as one day,</HI> and therefore when God's time is come, the &s;et time that he has appointed, he will maugre all the oppo&s;i|tion of men and devils, he will come down and deliver his people, and in &s;uch a manner, that the enemy &s;hall know, as well as friends, it is the Lord's doing. A deliverer is born and bred in Pharaoh's court, a Mo&s;es is brought up in all the learning of the Egyptians, for Pharaoh intended him for a high and exalted po&s;t: but when offers of the highe&s;t prefer|ment are made to him, he did not catch at them as &s;ome folks now do, who are very good and humble till &s;omething occurs to take them from God. Young as he was, he re|fu&s;ed the highe&s;t dignity, and &s;purned at it with an holy contempt; and chu&s;es rather to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy all the grandeur and plea&s;ures of, per|haps, one of the greate&s;t courts on earth. Forty years continued he in this &s;tate of ob|&s;curity, in which time he acquired &s;uch a com|petent degree, and variety of knowledge, as qualified him for every thing God intended him for: the occa&s;ion of this, was his kind attempt to compo&s;e a difference between two of his brethren, one of whom accu&s;ed him of murder, on which he that was to be king in Je&s;hurun, is forced to fly into a &s;trange land; there he &s;ubmits to the humble office of a
<PB N="202" REF="033217_0209_0FF6905C163C69D0">
&s;ervant, marries, and lives in a &s;tate of &s;ub|jection for forty years, as was &s;aid before. At length, when he was eighty years old, dream|ing of no &s;uch thing, behold God calls, and commands him to go and deliver his people; as he him&s;elf informs us, who is the author of this book, ver. 1. <HI>Now Mo&s;es kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, prie&s;t of Midian:</HI> he might have &s;aid, what &s;uch a &s;cholar as I keep a parcel of &s;heep! &s;uch a learned man as I am employed in &s;uch a menial &s;ervice! &s;ome proud hearts would break fir&s;t, but you never knew a truly great man but would &s;toop; &s;ome that are called great men, &s;well till they bur&s;t; like &s;turdy oaks, they think they can &s;tand every wind, till &s;ome dreadful &s;torm comes and blows them up by the roots, while the humble reed bends and ri&s;es again. Mo&s;es was one of the latter, he keeps the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, and leads them to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. This &s;hows how per&s;ons ought to methodize their time; but however the name of a Methodi&s;t is de&s;pi&s;ed, they will never be bad &s;ervants and ma&s;ters; you would be only weathercocks, unle&s;s you took care to order things in proper &s;ea&s;ons: the devotion and bu&s;ine&s;s of a Meth|odi&s;t go hand in hand; I will a&s;&s;ure you, Mo&s;es was a Methodi&s;t, a very fine one, a very &s;trong one too; he kept his flock, but that did not hinder his going to Horeb, he took them to the de&s;ert, and being thus em|ployed in his lawful bu&s;ine&s;s, God met him.
<PB N="203" REF="033217_0210_0FF6905E3744E530">
Some &s;ay, we encourage people in idlene&s;s; I deny it; we &s;ay, people ought to be indu&s;tri|ous; and I defy any one to &s;ay, a per&s;on is called by God that is negligent in his calling. <HI>The angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the bu&s;h:</HI> &s;ome think this angel was Gabriel, but mo&s;t agree, and I believe with the greate&s;t probability, that it was Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>the angel of the everla&s;ting covenant;</HI> and an expo&s;itor tells you, that the eternal <HI>Logos,</HI> longing to become man, often vi&s;ited this earth in that form, as an evidence of his com|ing by and by, and dying a cur&s;ed death for man. The manner of this angel's appearing is taken particular notice of, it was to Mo&s;es when nobody was with him; I do not hear he had &s;o much as a boy, or one companion; and I mention this, becau&s;e I believe we have often found that we are never le&s;s alone than when with God; we often want this and that companion, but happy they that can &s;ay, Lord, thy company is enough. Mo&s;es was &s;tartled at the &s;ight, and I don't know that he is to be di&s;commended for it, it was not to gratify a bare curio&s;ity, but &s;eeing a bu&s;h burning it engaged his attention, and made him think that &s;omething was uncommon; <HI>the bu&s;h burned with fire and yet was not con&s;umed:</HI> this &s;tartled him, as it was intended to do; for where God de&s;igns to &s;peak, he will fir&s;t gain attention from the per&s;on &s;poken to; Mo&s;es therefore &s;ays, <HI>I will now turn a&s;ide and &s;ee this great &s;ight, why the bu&s;h is not burned:</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="033217_0211_0FF69060FB3D0230">
he did not know but the bu&s;h might take fire by &s;ome accident; he &s;aw no fire come from above, he &s;aw no fire round the bu&s;h, yet that did not &s;o much &s;tartle him, as to &s;ee, though it did burn, it was not con&s;umed, or in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed; it was a &s;trange &s;ight, but it was, my brethren, a glorious one; a &s;ight which, I pray God, you and I may behold with faith and comfort this evening; for, my dear hearers, this bu&s;h, and the account of it, was given for our learning; and I will venture to &s;ay, could Mo&s;es ari&s;e from the dead, he would not be angry with me for telling you, this is of no private interpretation, but is in|tended as a &s;tanding le&s;&s;on, as a &s;ignificant em|blem of the church, and every individual child of God, till time it&s;elf &s;hall be no more. I would therefore ob&s;erve to you, that this bu&s;h,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, is typical of the church of God in all ages; the bu&s;h was burning, why might it not be a tall cedar, why might it not be &s;ome large or &s;ome glorious tree, why &s;hould the great God chu&s;e a bu&s;h, a lit|tle bu&s;h of briars and thorns, above any other thing? but becau&s;e the church of Chri&s;t gen|erally con&s;i&s;ts of poor, mean, de&s;picable crea|tures: though it is all glorious within, yet it is all de&s;picable without. It is ob&s;ervable, that when the church came to pro&s;per when Con&s;tantine &s;miled on it, it was &s;oon hugged to death; and that great poet, Milton ob|&s;erves, that when that emperor gave mini&s;ters rich ve&s;tments, high honors, great livings,
<PB N="205" REF="033217_0212_0FF690662CB47928">
and golden pulpits, there was a voice heard from heaven, &s;aying, this day there is poi&s;on come into the church; and I have &s;ometimes &s;aid in di&s;cour&s;e, I don't doubt but if any one made an experiment, and left 100,000<HI>l.</HI> or 200,000<HI>l.</HI> only among the Methodi&s;ts, there would be hundreds and thou&s;ands that would not be reckoned Methodi&s;ts now, that would turn Methodi&s;ts pre&s;ently, that would buy an hymn-book, becau&s;e a part of the legacy would pay for the hymn-book and would wi&s;h to have a living into the bargain: but though <HI>not many mighty men, not many noble are called,</HI> yet &s;ome are; if any of you are rich here, and are Chri&s;tians, thank God for it, you ought to be doubly thankful for it; God's people are but like a little bramble bu&s;h. I remember an eminent mini&s;ter &s;aid once, when I heard him preach upon Chri&s;tmas-day, <HI>Chri&s;t per&s;onal is very rich, but Chri&s;t my&s;tical is very poor;</HI> and Je&s;us Chri&s;t does this on purpo&s;e to confound the world. When he comes to judgment, millions that have their thou&s;ands now, will be damned and burnt to all eternity, and Chri&s;t's church will be rich to all eternity, that is now like a bramble all on fire.</P>
<P><HI>The bu&s;h burned,</HI> what is that for? it &s;hew|ed that Chri&s;t's church while in this world, will be a bu&s;h burning with fiery trials and afflictions of various kinds; this was a lively emblem of the &s;tate of religion, and liberty of I&s;rael at that time: they were bu&s;y making of brick, and there con&s;equently were burning continually; as though the Lord had &s;aid,
<PB N="206" REF="033217_0213_0FF690684449C358">
this bu&s;h is burning with fire, &s;o my people are burning with &s;lavery. Ah but, &s;ay you, that was only the ca&s;e of the I&s;raelites when they were under Pharaoh; pray is not that the ca&s;e of the church in all ages? yes, it has been; read your bibles, and you may in&s;tant|ly &s;ee that it is little el&s;e than an hi&s;torical ac|count of a burning bu&s;h; and though there might be &s;ome periods wherein the church had re&s;t, yet the&s;e periods have been of a &s;hort date; and if God's people have <HI>walked in the comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> it is only like a calm that precedes an earthquake. If you remember, before the la&s;t earthquake, it was a fine morning, and who when they aro&s;e in the morning, would have thought the earth &s;hould &s;hake under them before night; and &s;o with the church when they are in a calm, and all &s;eems &s;afe there, then comes a &s;torm: God prepare us for it.</P>
<P>But this is not only the ca&s;e with the church of Chri&s;t collected, but al&s;o it is &s;o with indi|vidual believers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that God in|tends to make great u&s;e of as prophets in his church. I know very well that 'tis &s;aid, that now the ca&s;e is altered: modern commenta|tors therefore, and our great Dr. Young, calls them downy Doctors; they tell us, now we have got a Chri&s;tian king and governor, and are under the toleration act, we &s;hall have no per&s;ecution; and, ble&s;&s;ed be God, we have had none &s;ince this family has been on the throne: May God continue it till time &s;hall

be no more. Yet, my dear hears, we &s;hall find, if God's word is true, whether we are born under a de&s;potic power, or a free gov|ernment, that they that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution. You have heard of that &s;aying, <HI>Wonder not at the fiery trial wherewith you are to be tried;</HI> and God &s;aith, <HI>I have cho&s;en thee,</HI> which is applica|ble to every believer, <HI>in the furnace of afflic|tion.</HI> Now the furnace is a hot place, and they that are tried in the furnace mu&s;t be burnt &s;urely. Now what mu&s;t the Chri&s;tian burn with? with tribulation and per&s;ecution. I heard a per&s;on not long ago &s;ay, I have no enemies.

Why, &s;ure, &s;ay &s;ome, you make God a tyrant; no, but hav|ing made our&s;elves devil's incarnate, we are now in a &s;tate of preparation, and the&s;e vari|ous trials are intended by the great God to train us up for heaven; and therefore, that you may not think I am drawing a picture without any life, give me leave to ob&s;erve, that it is particularly remarkable, that though <HI>the bu&s;h burned, it was not con&s;umed:</HI> it was this &s;truck Mo&s;es, he looked to &s;ee why the bu&s;h was not con&s;umed.

Who is that, that &s;ays he has got into &s;uch an e&s;tate that nothing di&s;turbs him? vain man! he di&s;covers an ignorance of Chri&s;t; are you greater then than the apo&s;|tle Paul? &s;ome people think that the apo&s;tles had no trials; &s;o they think, perhaps, of &s;ome mini&s;ters, that they are always on the mount, while, perhaps, they have been in the burning to get that &s;ermon for them. We that are to &s;peak for others, mu&s;t expect to be tempt|ed in all things like to our brethren, or we &s;hould be only poor whip-&s;yllabub preachers, and not rich men's hearts. But whether min|i&s;ters or people burn, the great God, the an|gel of the everla&s;ting covenant, &s;poke to Mo|&s;es out of the bu&s;h; he did not &s;tand at a di&s;|tance from the bu&s;h, he did not &s;peak to him &s;o much as one yard or foot from the bu&s;h, but he &s;poke to him out of the bu&s;h; he &s;aid, Mo&s;es, Mo&s;es, my people &s;hall burn in this bu&s;h to the end of time, but be not afraid, I will &s;uccour them; when they burn, I will burn too. There is a &s;cripture va&s;tly &s;trong to this purpo&s;e, in which it is not &s;aid, <HI>the good will of him that</HI> was <HI>in the bu&s;h,</HI> but <HI>the

good will of him that</HI> dwelt <HI>in the bu&s;h.</HI> Amaz|ing! I thought God dwelt in heaven; but as a poor woman who was once in darkne&s;s fourteen years, before &s;he was brought out of it, &s;aid, God has two homes, one in heaven, the other in the lowe&s;t heart. He dwells in the bu&s;h, and I am &s;ure if he did not, the devil and their own cur&s;ed hearts would burn the bu&s;h to a&s;hes. How is it that it is not con|&s;umed? why, it is becau&s;e God has declared it &s;hall not be con&s;umed; he has made an everla&s;ting covenant, and I pity tho&s;e that are not acquainted with an intere&s;t in God's cov|enant; and it would be better that people would pity them, than di&s;pute with them: I really believe a di&s;puting devil is one of the wor&s;t devils that can be brought into God's church, for he comes with his gown and book in his hand, and I &s;hould always &s;u&s;pect the devil when he comes in his gown and band, and this is the cau&s;e they agree and di&s;agree. Some, who it's to be hoped are God's chil|dren, if you tell them that God has loved them with an everla&s;ting love, they are afraid to &s;uck it in, and e&s;pecially if you pop out the word election, or that hard word prede&s;tina|tion, they will be quite frightned; but talk to them in another way, their dear hearts will rejoice. God has &s;aid, <HI>As the waters of Noah &s;hall cea&s;e forever, &s;o he will not forget the cov|enant of his peace: nothing &s;hall pluck them out of his hand.</HI> Ah! &s;ay &s;ome, the apo&s;tle has &s;aid, <HI>that neither things pre&s;ent, nor things to

come, &s;hall &s;eparate us from the love of Chri&s;t:</HI> but he has not &s;aid an evil heart &s;hall not; I fancy that is one of the <HI>pre&s;ent things.</HI> The bu&s;h is not con&s;umed, becau&s;e if the devil is in the bu&s;h, God is in the bu&s;h too; if the devil acts one way, the Lord, the Spirit, acts another to balance it, and the Spirit of God is engaged to train up the &s;ouls of his people; and God has determined the bu&s;h &s;hall not be con&s;umed; his Spirit &s;tands near believers to &s;upport and guide, and make them more than conquerors: all that are given to Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall come, he will not lo&s;e one of them; this is food for the children of God; a bad mind will turn every thing to poi&s;on; and if it was not for this, that God had promi&s;ed to keep them, my &s;oul within the&s;e thirty years would have &s;unk a thou&s;and times over. Come then, O &s;uffering &s;aints, to you the word of this &s;al|vation is &s;ent. I don't know who of you are the followers of the Lamb; may the Spirit of the living God point them out, may every one be enabled to &s;ay, I am the man. O, &s;ays one, I have been watching and very attentive to-night, but you have not mentioned my burnings; what do you think of my burning lu&s;ts? what do you think of my burning cor|ruptions? what do you think of my burning pride? O, perhaps &s;ome of you will &s;ay, thank God, I have no pride at all; like the bi&s;hop of Cambray, as mentioned by Dr. Watts, who &s;aid, he had received many &s;ins from his fath|er Adam, but, thank God, he had no pride.

Alas! alas! we are all as proud as the devil. Pray what do you think of Pa&s;&s;ion, that burns not only them&s;elves but all around them? what do you think of enmity? what do you think of jealou&s;y, is not this &s;omething that burns the bu&s;h? and there are &s;ome people that pride them&s;elves, they have not got &s;o much of the bea&s;t about them, they never got drunk, &s;corn to commit murder, and at the &s;ame time are as full of enmity, of envy, mal|ice, and pride, as the devil: the Lord God help &s;uch to &s;ee their condition. Happy is it Chri&s;t can dwell in the bu&s;h when we can|not dwell our&s;elves there: there are few chri&s;|tians can live together, very few relations can live together under one roof; we can take that from other people that we can't bear from our own fle&s;h and blood; and if God did not bear with us more than we bear with one a|nother, we &s;hould all have been de&s;troyed ev|ery day. Does the devil make you &s;ay, that you will give all up; I will go to the Taber|nacle no more; I will lay on my couch and take my ea&s;e; Oh! if this is the ca&s;e of any to-night, thus tempted by &s;atan, may God re&s;cue their &s;ouls.

I remember when I was preach|ing at Exeter, a &s;tone came and made my forehead bleed, I found at that very time the word came with double power to a labourer that was gazing at me, who was wounded at the &s;ame time by another &s;tone, I felt for the lad more than for my&s;elf, went to a friend, and the lad came to me, Sir, &s;ays he, the man gave me a wound, but Je&s;us healed me; I never had my bonds broke till I had my head broke. I appeal to you, whether you were not better when it was colder than now, becau&s;e your nerves were braced up; you have a day like a dog-day, now you are weak, and are obliged to fan your&s;elves: thus it is pro&s;perity lulls the &s;oul, and I fear Chri&s;tians are &s;poiled by it.</P>
<P>Whatever your trials are, let this be your prayer, Lord, though the bu&s;h is burning, let it not be con&s;umed. I think that is too low, let it be thus; Lord, when the bu&s;h is burn|ing, let me not burn lower as the fire does, but let me burn higher and higher: I thank thee, my God, for trouble; I thank thee, my God, for putting me into the&s;e afflictions one after another; I thought I could &s;ing a re|quiem to my&s;elf, that I &s;hould have a little re&s;t, but trouble came from that very quarter where I might rea&s;onably expect the greate&s;t comfort: I thank thee for nocking my hands off from the creature; Lord, I believe, help my unbelief; and thus you will go on ble&s;&s;ing

<P>I HAVE often told you, in my plain way of &s;peaking, that grace is very frequently grafted on a crab-&s;tock; that the Lord Je&s;us picks out per&s;ons of the mo&s;t peevi&s;h, churli&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, and imparts to them the large&s;t mea&s;ure of grace, but for want of a better natural temper, a great deal of grace does not &s;hine &s;o bright in them, as a &s;mall degree in tho&s;e that are con&s;titutionally good-natured: per&s;ons of this di&s;po&s;ition are generally com|plaining, and are not only tormentors of them|&s;elves, but are great plagues to tho&s;e that are about them: you will hear them always com|plaining &s;omething or other is the matter.

thing, to leave off chiding others to chide our own &s;elves, till we can find nothing in our&s;elves to chide for; this we &s;hall find will be a good way to grow in the divine life, when, by con|&s;tant application to the Lamb of God, we get a ma&s;tery over tho&s;e things which hitherto have had the ma&s;tery over us; but are the&s;e the only people that complain? are people of a melancholy di&s;po&s;ition only &s;ubject to a di&s;|quietude of heart? I will venture to affirm, that the greate&s;t, the deare&s;t children of God, have got their complaining, and their dreary hours. Tho&s;e who have been favoured with large mea&s;ures of grace, even tho&s;e that have been wrapped up as it were to the third hea|vens, ba&s;king on the mount in the &s;un&s;hine of redeeming grace, and in raptures of love cry|ing out, <HI>It is good for us to be here,</HI> even the&s;e mu&s;t go down to Geth&s;emane; and if they would not be &s;corched with a &s;trong burning fever from the &s;un of pro&s;perity, &s;hall find clouds from time to time over&s;hadowing them, not to burn, but to keep them low. It is on this account, that you &s;ee good men in differ|ent frames at different times: our Lord him|&s;elf was &s;o, he rejoiced &s;ometimes in &s;pirit, but at other times you find him, e&s;pecially near the la&s;t, crying out, <HI>My &s;oul is exceeding &s;or|rowful even unto death, tarry you here and watch.</HI> And I am going to tell you of one to-night, who had the honor of being called, <HI>the man after God's own heart;</HI> and who, though an Old Te&s;tament &s;aint, was greatly ble&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="219" REF="033217_0226_0FF6908746577578">
a New Te&s;tament &s;pirit, and had the honor of compo&s;ing P&s;alms, which in all pa&s;t ages of the church have been, and in future ones will be a rich magazine, and &s;tore-hou&s;e of &s;piritual experience, from which the children of God may draw &s;piritual armour for fight|ing the good fight of faith, until God &s;hall call them to life eternal: may this be your happy lot. What frame was this good man in when he compo&s;ed this forty-&s;econd P&s;alm? the P&s;alm it&s;elf can be&s;t tell. It &s;eems compo&s;ed when he was either per&s;ecuted by Saul, or driven from his own court by his fondling, beloved &s;on, Ab&s;alom; then David appeared truly great; I honor him when I &s;ee him yon|der, attending a few &s;heep; but I admire the young &s;tripling, when I &s;ee him come out with his &s;ling and &s;tone, and aiming it at the head of Goliah, the enemy of God; or, when exalted and filling the &s;eat of ju&s;tice; but to me he never appears greater, than when he is bowed down in low circum&s;tances, be&s;et on every &s;ide, &s;truggling between &s;en&s;e and faith; and as the &s;un, after an eclip&s;e, breaking forth with greater lu&s;tre to all the &s;pec|tators. In this view we mu&s;t con&s;ider this great, this good man, David, when he cries out, <HI>Why art thou ca&s;t down, O my &s;oul, why art thou di&s;quieted within me? hope thou in God.</HI></P>

I will not &s;ay, my thoughts always run in a religious channel, but I will &s;ay I wi&s;h they did. The words in our text, as connected with what precedes and follows, contain the unchangeable truths of God; nor am I any ways &s;taggered by oppo&s;ition to the vindication of what the good old Puritants, and the Di&s;&s;enters of the pre&s;ent age, call evangelical doctrine. I do not know a man that has wrought in a legal &s;train, or that reads, or talks in common conver&s;ation in a legal &s;train, but di&s;covers his ignorance of, if not his enmity to the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith alone, by charging it with very bad con&s;equences, and endeavouring to explode it as a dangerous doctrine, de&s;tructive of holi|ne&s;s, which they would &s;eem to patronize; though if one were always to judge of them by their calumniating practice, one would imagine they had never read with proper at|tention, either the preceeding or following chapters, nor that wherein is our text, which proves it to be a doctrine according to godli|ne&s;s, and therefore properly begins <HI>What &s;hall we &s;ay then, &s;hall we continue in &s;in that grace may abound?</HI> You will &s;ay, I have been in&s;i&s;t|ing upon the univer&s;al depravity of nature, I have been bringing all down upon an equal level; that I have not only mentioned the dreadful &s;tate of Heathens, but the equally dreadful &s;tate of the haughty Jews, &amp; ignorant

Suppo&s;ing a child when young grows up to a man, is &s;prinkled, or dipped as the children I &s;aw at Li&s;bon, or in our front, as they are made large enough to dip in, though now they &s;prinkle; &s;uppo&s;e one of the&s;e grows up a child of the devil, and &s;ays, I don't look upon what was done in my infancy to be bapti&s;m, I will be baptized re|ally; and yet &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, that per&s;on takes up only the outward &s;ign, and both of them die and go to the devil, would it give either of them &s;atisfaction to &s;ay, I am in hell, but I was baptized when an infant, or adult? both of them would have to lament they were tor|mented

in the flame. Would it not be better for us to take care not to offend our brethren, not to rai&s;e one anothers &s;pirits and corrup|tions, but rather, when we come together, talk of the heart, and enquire whether, when we received the outward &s;ign by &s;prinkling or dipping, we really received the thing &s;ignified in our hearts, and exemplify that thing &s;igni|fied, in our lives.</P>
<P>Now pray what is the thing &s;ignified? we need not go farther for an an&s;wer than our text, <HI>As many of them as were baptized into Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, were baptized into his death:</HI> and it is worthy remarking, that our Lord told his di&s;ciples, that they were <HI>to baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Now I believe all per&s;ons that have but a little &s;kill in &s;cripture interpre|tation, mu&s;t allow that the word name &s;igni|fies Chri&s;t; my name is in him, &s;peaking in the Old Te&s;tament of Chri&s;t's name; and when we &s;ay, <HI>in or by the name,</HI> it has a pecu|liar reference to every thing that belongs to God: and I verily believe that when the Re|deemer &s;aid, <HI>baptize them in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> he not only intended to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine of three per&s;ons in one God, but al&s;o to point out the nature of true bapti&s;m, namely, to be baptized into the na|ture of the Father, into the nature of the Son, and into the nature of the Holy Gho&s;t, and this &s;eems to be the meaning of our text, <HI>Know ye not that &s;o many as were baptized:</HI>

if we have been baptized aright, have been baptized not only in the name of Chri&s;t, but have been baptized into Chri&s;t? that is, we have not only put on Chri&s;t in an outward profe&s;&s;ion, but have been &s;o baptized by the Holy Gho&s;t, as to be made members of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical body, united to him by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; &s;o that in a degree, though not in ev|ery &s;en&s;e, we are one with Chri&s;t, and the Fath|er, through him. This is religion common to all, whether we are Bapti&s;t or Poedo-bapti&s;t; for we may call one another by this and that name, it is no matter what we are called, the grand matter is, what God looks upon us to be; whether we are become by bapti&s;m, and with the powerful operations of the Spirit of God accompanying that ordinance, branches of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the true vine. It has been always an argument with me, and I may plead for the &s;ame liberty that I give, that I think infant-bapti&s;m is an ordinance of Chri&s;t, be|cau&s;e if our children are not to be baptized, they are left inferior in their privileges to the Jews, their children were circumci&s;ed to God, and why &s;hould not our children be as &s;oon initiated into Chri&s;t as they? The apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>He is not a Jew that is one outwardly, neither is that circumci&s;ion which is outwardly in the fle&s;h,</HI> but circumci&s;ion is <HI>that of the heart and of the &s;pirit, who&s;e prai&s;e is not of men but of God:</HI> &s;o it may be &s;aid of outward bapti&s;m, he is not a Chri&s;tian who is baptized only out|wardly, but he that is baptized inwardly of

the Spirit, <HI>who&s;e prai&s;e is not of men but of God.</HI> When we get a pro&s;elite, we are &s;o fond of them that we hug them to death: I have got the prai&s;e of men e&s;pecially when religion walks in &s;ilver &s;lippers; when a per&s;on &s;ays, I may get bu&s;ine&s;s if I get into &s;uch a church, into &s;uch a &s;ociety; a man may become reli|gious as he may go to 'Change for trade, but he is a Chri&s;tian who is one inwardly, who has no worldly views, no de&s;igns but what are &s;ubordinate to the glory of God. The pri|mitive Chri&s;tians gave great proof of their &s;incerity, they were baptized over the dead; <HI>what &s;hall they do who are baptized for,</HI> or over, <HI>the dead?</HI> notwith&s;tanding they &s;aw their fel|low creatures murdered, they dared to go o|penly to be baptized; though they know very well &s;oon after that for their bapti&s;m with water, they &s;hould be baptized with fire, and yet they dared openly to avow their profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t. This is being baptized into Chri&s;t; well, what then? why, then we are baptized into his death. Can you tell me what that is? I cannot fully, I don't know that my&s;elf; and we &s;hould preach according to our experience, (a man of little true grace, he will give a lit|tle, little, little practical application; very little, becau&s;e he has but little him&s;elf; a man that has a good deal of it in his heart, he will not neglect his principles, but he will give the people a good &s;ound meal of practical re|ligion) though I am but a babe in Chri&s;t, though I have been in Chri&s;t four or five and

thirty years, and know but little of Chri&s;t, yet I think I can tell you a little what it is to be baptized into Chri&s;t, to be baptized into his death. Am I immediately to die in the body? that does not always follow, but we are to die daily, we are to be conformed to Chri&s;t's death, which we never can till we have been enabled by his power to die. When we talk of dying the death of Chri&s;t, we mean being crucified to the world with him. <HI>I live,</HI> &s;ays Paul, <HI>yet not I, but Chri&s;t lives in me: and the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.</HI> Now we all come into the world alive to the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil. Some people &s;ay, a child mu&s;t cry in order to prove it&s;elf an heir; what do you think it cries for? I believe &s;ome people think 'tis becau&s;e it is in pain, but I am afraid the child cries becau&s;e he is hurt; I believe he finds the air too cool for him; and the fir&s;t thing he does, is giving a proof of original &s;in to his parents, and all the attendants about him: this is called in &s;cripture, the old man; and however &s;ome may find fault with the Church of England, and its forms (perhaps they may be mended, but I que&s;tion whether we have men capable of mending them now-a-days, either for zeal or &s;piritual knowledge) yet I am &s;ure there is &s;omething in it very good, particularly there is that prayer to be put up by a child, de&s;erves to be written in letters of gold, <HI>Grant, O Lord, that all things belonging to the old man may die in me;</HI> and then follows (what I &s;hall &s;peak of

by and by) <HI>and all belonging to the new man may live and grow in me.</HI> There is the whole &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of religion, the Alpha and Ome|ga, the beginning, the middle and the end, as Mr. Ambro&s;e's works are intitled. We want nothing but all things belonging to the old man to die in us, and all things belonging to the new to live, to make us fit for the king|dom of Chri&s;t: and if we can find this in us, God grant we may not quarrel one with a|nother, though I verily believe young men think the old man is very trouble&s;ome. There is one does not live very far from hence, who is a very worthy man, I remember a few years ago he came in, in his fir&s;t love, &s;aying, "he had got on the mount; the fire burnt up|wards, though there was a good deal of &s;moak. Pray, &s;ays I, is the old man dead yet? no, &s;aid he, he is not quite dead, but &s;poke as if he thought he was expiring; &s;ays I, I will &s;peak to you three or four years hence. Some time after that, meeting him, I a&s;ked him con|cerning the old man, he &s;aid he thought he was alive and wor&s;e than ever, and that he was a fly creature, would lie down as if he was a&s;leep, that he may attack you when off your guard the better." I heard of a good man in the country, who &s;aid, he found his corrup|tions were a mon&s;ter of a thou&s;and heads; now this is called a crucifixion, which is a painful and a gradual death, but a certain death: God forbid any of you now &s;hould turn the food into poi&s;on, &s;aying, this is a very
<PB N="245" REF="033217_0252_0FF690C32C4A16C8">
good doctrine, I like it; the mini&s;ter &s;ays the old man dies slow, &s;o I will not crucify him; they tell me he will die by and by, but not yet, &s;o I will not trouble my|&s;elf much about him; why then, my dear hearer, whoever thou art, thou talke&s;t like a &s;tinking hypocrite, or a rank, vile Antinomi|an; how, how, is the old man &s;uch a plea&s;ant companion, that you love to have him dwell|ing under your roof? would you chu&s;e to have a parcel of whores and rogues to live in your hou&s;es? would you like, if you lived by let|ting of lodgings, two or three rooms &s;uppo&s;e, to have a parcel of thieves and robbers, and pickpockets, come and tell you their profe&s;|&s;ion, would it not be fooli&s;h for you to let &s;uch people in, would it not? and ju&s;t &s;uch fools you are to let pickpockets, &s;treet-robbers, God-robbers, vile pro&s;titutes in your wicked hearts, the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;ts of the eye, and the pride of life, &s;tay not only till quarter-day, but long after: before you turn them out, you may be dead; no, no, it is not an in&s;tantaneous, but a gradual, progre&s;&s;ive work.</P>
<P>Then we are baptized into Chri&s;t, when we &s;tudy to glorify Chri&s;t; that is the rea&s;on that God Almighty &s;ends you &s;o many trials, that you may be baptized into his death; and generally you will find, when you have had mo&s;t communications from God, that &s;ome cro&s;s trials &s;oon follow. Ha&s;t thou been pray|ing for re&s;ignation? perhaps God takes away a beloved child; you have been praying for

great patience, perhaps a cro&s;s wife, a Nabal of a hu&s;band, bad &s;ervants, undutiful children, or &s;omething or other, and the devil at the head of them, making you unea&s;y, &s;o that you find you have not &s;o much patience as you thought you had; you never was upon the mount in your lives, but when you came down, you were tempted to break the tables: was it not &s;o with Mo&s;es after forty days com|munion with God? down he came, and &s;ee|ing the people dancing round the calf, down he throws the tables, and breaks them all to pieces; and if God was not to keep us, after all our communion with him, we &s;hould break the tables to pieces and be damned. After all that per&s;on then is dying every day, who looks upon him&s;elf every morning as one that is to be crucified afre&s;h, that looks for cro&s;&s;es, and at the &s;ame time walks &s;o inoffen&s;ively as to bring no cro&s;s upon him&s;elf.

<P>Then we mu&s;t be rai&s;ed to newne&s;s of life, as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead by the glory of the Father; this points out to us in what &s;en&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the re&s;urrection and the life, and &s;hews us that every thing Je&s;us Chri&s;t did and &s;uffered, mu&s;t be &s;piritually experi|enced in our hearts.

life imparts new principles, a new under&s;tand|ing, a new will and new affections, a renewed con&s;cience, a renewed memory, nay, a renew|ed body, by making it the temple of the living God, an habitation of God through the Spirit, and walking in newne&s;s of life; if I am not mi&s;taken, it implies a progre&s;&s;ive motion, going from &s;trength to &s;trength, from one degree of grace to another, pa&s;&s;ing from glory to glory, for grace is only glory in the bud, till grace is &s;wallowed up in endle&s;s glory. A per&s;on that walks, though he may not walk equally fa&s;t as others, yet may get ground: hence, <HI>not to go forward is to go backward.</HI> Enoch walked with God; it be&s;poke the habitual tendency of his heart, the actual exerci&s;e of grace, that he was kept in a lively frame, walked with God among a very wicked generation, dared to be good when all were wicked around him, and he was &s;o favoured, as to be tran&s;lated to heaven; this was the ca&s;e with Elijah. <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> &s;ays the Lord, <HI>go up to the mount and die:</HI> God made him undre&s;s him&s;elf, and put on his own grave clothes, gives him a &s;ight of Canaan, but to let him know that he even to the very la&s;t would cha&s;ti&s;e his people, when he is even taking them to heaven; tells him, thou &s;halt not go into the earthly Canaan, but I will take thee to the heavenly one, which is far better.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, after he had &s;et before the Hebrews the great cloud of witne&s;&s;es of Old Te&s;tament be|lievers, exhorts them to look higher, even to Je&s;us the common Saviour, and that not tran|&s;iently, but earne&s;tly and con&s;tantly, in his mediatorial character of humiliation, as en|during unheard of, unparallelled contradiction of &s;inners again&s;t him&s;elf; <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ye be weary, and faint in your minds.</HI> If we had not &s;uch an example &s;et before us, and brought to us by the Holy Gho&s;t in a &s;uffering hour, we &s;hould never hold out to the end: this was not the contradiction of the openly profane and &s;candalous, tho&s;e that were without, &s;o much as from tho&s;e that were within the pale of the church, even tho&s;e to whom were com|mitted the lively oracles of God, who had not

only the very bible in their own hands, but were &s;et apart to explain it to others. That the words of our text were &s;poken to them, appears from the preceding ver&s;e, in which he bids them <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures;</HI> as a per&s;on digs for a mine, or &s;earches for &s;ome hidden trea&s;ure. The word bible, or book which I have in my hand, is well applied to the holy &s;criptures, becau&s;e it is the book of God, writ|ten by him, that is, by his order, and by tho&s;e who were in&s;pired by him for that end; and yet, of all writings in the world, the&s;e are mo&s;t neglected! God has conde&s;cended to become an author, and yet people will not read his writings. There are very few that ever gave this book of God, the grand charter of &s;alva|tion, one fair reading through: though we profe&s;s to have a&s;&s;ented to the truth of &s;crip|ture, as our Lord &s;aid, <HI>in them we think we have eternal life,</HI> yet mo&s;t read them as they would a proclamation, a romance, a play, or novels, that help only to bring them to the devil, but chu&s;e not to read God's book, which is to be our guide to glory; <HI>they are they,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>which te&s;tify of me:</HI> Lord God convert and change our hearts.</P>
<P>However, this was &s;poken in reference to the Old Te&s;tament, and certainly &s;hows us, that Chri&s;t is the trea&s;ure hid in that field, yet as there are equal proofs of the divinity of the New Te&s;tament, the word Holy Scrip|tures include both, e&s;pecially as Chri&s;t is the antitype of all the types, the Alpha and Ome|ga,
<PB N="257" REF="033217_0264_0FF690E0533D1068">
the beginning and the end of all divine revelation: would to God he was your Alpha and Omega too! Now, &s;aith Chri&s;t, you pre|tend to reverence the &s;criptures; you that are &s;et apart as per&s;ons learned in the &s;criptures, ye Scribes, ye lawyers, &s;uch as were mention|ed in the go&s;pel to-day. I fancy &s;ome people think, that when we read of lawyers in the &s;criptures, that we mean &s;uch lawyers as ours, who deal only in the civil and common law, but they were tho&s;e that opened and explain|ed the law to the people; the&s;e were the per|&s;ons who thought and profe&s;&s;ed, that in them they had eternal life, that they te&s;tify of Chri&s;t the great Prophet that was promi&s;ed in the &s;criptures to come into the world; yet &s;aith our divine ma&s;ter, to the&s;e very profe&s;&s;ors the&s;e ma&s;ters in I&s;rael, <HI>ye will not come to me that ye may have life:</HI> though I am now pre&s;ent with you, though I am now come to explain the &s;criptures, and fulfil them, am now come to proclaim to you that life, that eternal life, which the &s;criptures declare were to be pub|li&s;hed and proclaimed by me, yet <HI>ye will not come unto me that ye may have life.</HI></P>
<P>By eternal life we are to under&s;tand, all the ble&s;&s;ings of a converted &s;tate, particularly the pardon of &s;ins, not only before conver&s;ion but after. It is impo&s;&s;ible but there &s;hould be &s;in every day and every hour in every profe&s;|&s;ing per&s;on. My dear hearers, as I &s;hall not have an opportunity for &s;ometime to &s;peak to you, I don't chu&s;e, e&s;pecially when I am about

to take my leave of you, to &s;peak any thing that is &s;evere, but I a&s;&s;ure you without at|tempting to offend, with a broken heart I a&s;&s;ure you, that this was the treatment Je&s;us Chri&s;t met with of old, and God knows, this is the treatment Je&s;us Chri&s;t meets with now: <HI>ye will not come to me that ye may have eternal life.</HI></P>
<P>If I am not mi&s;taken, and I think I am not, the words &s;uppo&s;e, that they and we are all dead in &s;in, for if we are not, I do not know why we need come to have life; and I men|tion this, becau&s;e for want of believing and knowing this, &s;ome that pretend to know Chri&s;t and to preach him, forget to lay the proper foundation, original &s;in; and that there is no ability or inclination in the heart of a natural man, &s;o much as to do any thing &s;piritual; he is &s;tupid and dead. But if we have eyes to &s;ee, if we have ears to hear, and if our hearts are not waxed hard, doubtle&s;s it would appear as clear to us as the &s;un &s;hin|ing in its meridian brightne&s;s, that man was dead till God breathed into him the breath of life, and then he became a living &s;oul. I know &s;ome people believe that the words mean this, that God breathed into man, and he became a natural living &s;oul, like other animals, but then they don't con&s;ider what a life God did breath into the &s;oul, he breathed into it the life of God, a &s;piritual life was breathed into the &s;oul; it is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t, but at the &s;ame time in the mo&s;t conci&s;e terms

that is po&s;&s;ible, none but God, none but a man in&s;pired by God, could &s;ay &s;o much in &s;o few words; it &s;hows great &s;kill in men to &s;ay &s;o much in a little; what unin&s;pired man ever wrote &s;o as Mo&s;es did? Now Mo&s;es when he penned the &s;criptures &s;aid, <HI>God made man after his own image,</HI> and you know ten thou&s;and volumes could not have &s;aid more than that. How long do you think it was that man continued in his original purity? I don't know that I ever yet heard, that any one thought he continued in his ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate &s;o long as from Saturday to Saturday. Mr. Bo&s;ton, who, perhaps, is one of the be&s;t writ|ers that ever Scotland produced, &s;ays, that there is an allu&s;ion in one of the P&s;alms to man's &s;udden fall, <HI>Man being</HI> born <HI>in honor, continued not;</HI> i. e. but a night before he fell. O much good may do tho&s;e that boa&s;t of their free-will, that think they can &s;tand by a power of their own, when father Adam, who had no corruption, did not &s;tand a week, perhaps not two days; and how can we pretend to &s;tand, let us have what grace we will, when that grace has &s;o much corruption to oppo&s;e it? if Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not take care to &s;ecure our &s;tanding, we &s;hould fall to our ruin. Adam fell, and being our federal head, we fell in him. Why, &s;ays a Dei&s;t, and too many profe&s;&s;ors al&s;o, pray what bu&s;ine&s;s had God Almighty to make our fall or our &s;tanding depend on anoth|er? you will not object to this you church of England men, will you? then why have you

god-fathers and god-mothers to promi&s;e for you? why have we members of parliament to be the heads of the people, and what the par|liament does, the people do, you have con&s;ti|tuted them your heads and repre&s;entatives, you mu&s;t &s;tand and fall by them; &s;o if you are bound for a per&s;on, you mu&s;t &s;tand and fall with him, mu&s;t not you? I remember one of the mini&s;ters that preached the morning exerci&s;es, when mo&s;t, if not all the churches in this city, were filled with go&s;pel-preachers, till on Bartholomew-day near 2,500 of them in the whole were turned out, and the other mini&s;ters that did not preach the go&s;pel con|tinued till the plague came, and then they ran away, and left the pulpits to tho&s;e that were turned out, who were willing to go into them, though they expected the plague would &s;eize them in preaching Chri&s;t there; one of tho&s;e mini&s;ters &s;ays, &s;uppo&s;e God had cho&s;e all that were to be created, and to proceed from the loins of Adam, had been pre&s;ent, and that he &s;hould have &s;aid to them, I have been &s;even days employed in preparing the whole crea|tion; I have made a garden, and will have one cho&s;e by you to dwell in it, as my vice|gerent and your repre&s;entative here below; here is Adam, the father of you all, whom I have ble&s;&s;ed with a partner, that is bone of his bone, and fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, a creature like him&s;elf; all that I de&s;ire of your head and repre&s;entative is, that he ab&s;tains from yonder tree, of every other tree in the garden he may

O there is not a &s;in|gle man but would have cho&s;en Adam to be their repre&s;entative, they would rather &s;tand and fall by him than by any body el&s;e; now pray why &s;hould we quarrel with him for act|ing in the manner we our&s;elves &s;hould have done, had we been in his &s;ituation? <HI>God,</HI> faith the apo&s;tle, <HI>included all under &s;in.</HI> What is &s;in but a breach, that is, a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law; <HI>the wages of &s;in is death;</HI> every tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of the law incurs damnation. Have we eaten of the forbidden fruit? We mu&s;t die, we are legally dead; and there is not a little child in the world that is not. It is e|nough to make the parents pray night and day for their children; there is not a child born but, to u&s;e the words of our own church, brings in with it corruption, which renders it liable to the wrath of God forever. Then, &s;ay &s;ome, it is true what I have heard &s;ay of you, that there are little children in hell a &s;pan long; I never had &s;uch a thought in my life; I never believed that any infants, black or white, were damned in hell. I think a poor child though it is born in a &s;tate of original &s;in, and I have often thought <HI>that</HI> is the rea&s;on why little children are &s;eized with &s;uch terrible di&s;orders as often carry them out of the world, with ten times more agony than

parents feel: a great proof of man's offence. We &s;ee a poor little infant &s;oon after it is born, in two or three months taken with fits, lie &s;creaming and &s;truggling, while the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed parents are breaking their hearts, and wi&s;hing, though they love it dearly, that God would take it out of its pain. Is not this a &s;trong proof that man is fallen from God? el&s;e who can tell what God de&s;igns hereby: however, I verily believe that by his grace be fits them for heaven. We have broken God's law, and are liable to eternal condemnation, we are therefore legally dead, every one of us without di&s;tinction; we are all upon a level, from the greate&s;t king in the world, who has it in his power to write death or life upon the poor condemned malefactors; bring him to the bar of God's holy law, and it will tell him there, thou art the malefactor in the &s;ight of God, thou thy&s;elf, and thus God is glorified. It is not greatne&s;s of &s;tation, nor external dif|ferences, that make a difference in the inter|nal &s;tate of the &s;oul. A nobleman may come with his &s;tar and garter to the king's bar, and be tried by his peers at We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and may be attended from the Tower by &s;ome of the king's officer's, but whether a nobleman be tried at We&s;tmin&s;ter hall, or a criminal in rags at the Old-Bailey, the law mu&s;t be exe|cuted upon both: this is our &s;tate towards God, we have lived in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, are legally dead now; is that all? Dr. Taylor, of Norwich, &s;ays, that all the lo&s;s we have had
<PB N="263" REF="033217_0270_0FF690EEB6A5A790">
by the fall is, that our mi&s;ery is temporary. Alas! alas! when Arminians talk of the fall, you will find very few of them have courage enough to &s;tab them&s;elves. Con&s;cience makes them cowards; they have lo&s;t all by Adam's fall. What death have we &s;uffered, not only legally but &s;piritually dead; what do I mean by that? why, that we are deprived of that life of God in which we originally &s;tood. Have you ever &s;een any body die? I have. Have you ever &s;een one of your friends die? have you ever &s;tole into the room, and looked but once at the dear object of your love, the part|ner of your life, but wait till the next day, and e&s;pecially in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ee how changed! the la&s;t object I &s;aw, put me in mind of the fall I &s;aw nature in. O what a change! the glory is departed!</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this legal death, there is a &s;pir|itual death, and the con&s;equence of that is e|ternal death; if I die in that &s;tate I mu&s;t die forever; that is, I mu&s;t be a creature living eternally bani&s;hed from God: if I be annihil|ated when I die, then, indeed, temporal death is all; but it is not &s;o, I am to live in anoth|er world; the wi&s;e&s;t man upon earth tells us, that there is a future &s;tate; and therefore by legal and &s;piritual death, I am liable to death eternal. I have the longer in&s;i&s;ted on this, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to know, or to value that life that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to impart to us and procure for us, without con&s;idering the nature of the death he delivers us from.</P>

Now let us attend to what our Lord &s;ays, <HI>Ye will not come to me that ye may have live:</HI> in the tenth chapter he &s;ays, <HI>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly:</HI> now what life is that? to be &s;ure, the life which a malefactor wants, who is tried by a jury; why, he wants to have the chain taken off; what do you and I want? for we may want to eternity if we plead our innocence; there is not one of us but mu&s;t plead guilty before God; well, what mu&s;t I do? why, if ever I have life, I mu&s;t be ac|quitted, &s;omething mu&s;t pronounce me not guilty; my con&s;cience &s;ays, guilty; why, then Je&s;us Chri&s;t came that we might have a legal life, that we might be acquitted from all that condemnation which we are under by our breaking his law; &s;o far the remedy an&s;wers to the di&s;ea&s;e; but the remedy would not be exten&s;ive enough if that was all; therefore, it was an excellent an&s;wer a poor woman made at the Old-Bailey, I heard of it twenty years ago: &s;he was brought &s;ick to the bar to re|ceive a pardon; the judge &s;aid, Woman, his maje&s;ty has given you a pardon: My lord, &s;ays &s;he, I thank his maje&s;ty for a pardon, and you for pronouncing it, but that is not all I want; what my poor &s;oul wants is, a pardon from Je&s;us Chri&s;t; what &s;ignifies a pardon from a judge, if I have a di&s;ea&s;e in me that will kill me? whether I am pardoned or not, I mu&s;t have my di&s;ea&s;e cured, that the pardon may do me good.

Spiritual life in the heart, is that which comes from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and this is the life of God in the &s;oul of man; it is not a metaphorical but a real thing, a re&s;urrection to life by the power of Chri&s;t, <HI>who is the re&s;urrection and the life,</HI> &s;o there is a connection between a legal and a &s;piritual life; the type and antitype an&s;wers as face an&s;wers to face in water: thus as all in Adam have died, &s;o all in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;econd Adam, are made alive.

Our Lord always &s;poke to the people in their own language; that is, thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart; he began with morality at the right place, we begin at the fifth commandment.

Thus we deceive our own &s;ouls, till Je&s;us Chri&s;t opens our eyes.

I live, yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me.</HI> In order to this I mu&s;t come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and believe on him for life eternal, the earne&s;t of which eternal life I mu&s;t have in my heart before I can be a&s;&s;ured I do believe on him. O, my dear hearers, do we think of this, this is no new doctrine; I &s;et out, ble&s;&s;ed be God, with this doctrine. The &s;econd &s;ermon I ever made, the &s;econd &s;ermon I ever preached, was on the&s;e words, <HI>He that is in Chri&s;t is a new creature:</HI> I was then about twenty years and a half old. The next &s;ermon I preached was upon, <HI>Ye are ju&s;|tified;</HI> the next &s;ermon, <HI>Ye are glorified;</HI> which &s;hows, that though I am near fifty-five years old, yet, I thank my God, I am &s;o far from changing my principles, which I am &s;ure I was taught by God's word and Spirit, that I am more and more confirmed, that if I was to die this moment, I hope I &s;hould have &s;trength and courage given me to &s;ay, I am more convinced of the efficacy and the power of tho&s;e truths which I preached when I was twenty years old, when I fir&s;t preached them.</P>
<P>Now, my dear hearers, what could enter

into the heart of any per&s;on in the world, to reject &s;uch a &s;alvation as this? can you think that when a king &s;aith to a pri&s;oner, let him go, he would refu&s;e it? there are &s;ome per|&s;ons that refu&s;e Chri&s;t. I remember when, by the bounty of the people here, we begged for the poor, one man went to the turnpike and &s;aid, this is Dr. Whitefield's bread and be damned. Human nature, what is it without Chri&s;t, the bread of life! We will not come to him that we may have life, though we may have it for a&s;king; no, not for life eter|nal, as a free gift: we will not come to Chri&s;t and accept it at his hand; we <HI>will</HI> not: it is not &s;aid, we <HI>&s;hall</HI> not, but we <HI>will</HI> not. Pray why will not people come to Chri&s;t to have life? becau&s;e they do not think that they are dead, and do not want it; remember when you &s;ay, <HI>you are rich and increa&s;ed in goods,</HI> that you know not, &s;aith Chri&s;t, that <HI>ye are poor and mi&s;erable, and blind and naked.</HI> We do not &s;ee our&s;elves fallen creatures, we do not know that; God give thee to know and feel, that <HI>there is no name given under heaven whereby we can be &s;aved, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> What &s;aith one, mu&s;t I have inward feeling? what would the polite world do without feeling? do you think they would go to the play-hou&s;e and places of public diver&s;ion without feeling? if I can feel other things that do not concern religion, how can I come to God till I feel a need o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> him.

as a free gift; we don't like to come to him as poor and needy. I remember I heard an excellent mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t in Scotland, one Mr. Wallis, of Dundee, preaching upon the&s;e words, <HI>Behold I &s;tand at the door and knock,</HI> &s;ays he. Chri&s;t comes knocking at the door to come into your hou&s;es, but you will not come down to accept of his mercy. When the prodigal &s;aid, <HI>I will ari&s;e and go to my Father, and will &s;ay unto him, I have &s;inned again&s;t hea|ven and in thy &s;ight, and am no more worthy to be called thy &s;on, make me as one of thy hired &s;ervants:</HI> now you think that it was very humble in him, he who was a &s;on of the head of the hou&s;e, to be willing to be a &s;ervant. 'Tis true he &s;ays, I will go to my father's hou&s;e, but at the &s;ame time he &s;ays, I will work for my living, he &s;hall not maintain me for nothing; but when he comes to his father, he is quite brought down, he &s;ays, <HI>I have &s;in|ned again&s;t heaven and in thy &s;ight;</HI> the joyful father cla&s;ps him in his withered arms, and takes the poor ragged wanderer home. The lawyers and other Jews thought they were righteous, and therefore they would not come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Our Lord &s;poke of the Pha|ri&s;ees, who tru&s;ted in them&s;elves that they were righteous, and would not come to him that they might have life; and if we tru&s;t in our&s;elves, neither &s;hall we. Our Lord &s;ays, <HI>I receive not honor from men. How can you come to him, that receive honor one of another? Honor to whom honor is due.</HI> To &s;uch as are

in power, whether in church or &s;tate, re&s;pect is due to their outward &s;ituation. I am for no levelling principles at all; but, my brethren, at the &s;ame time there is a fault, that we love to be applauded. There is no going to hea|ven, &s;aith Mr. Gurnal, without wearing a fool's cap and a fool's coat, and there is no going to heaven without being accounted fools: you &s;ee many profe&s;&s;ors follow the world, they have not courage enough to live in holy non-con|formity to the world; and many people are frightned from Chri&s;t, becau&s;e they would not be counted Methodi&s;ts; the fear of men has damned thou&s;ands. You will not come to him, becau&s;e you cannot tru&s;t God, and then we love the world more than Chri&s;t. <HI>If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him.</HI> If I had the management of people, their &s;hops would be open three or four hours before they are now; I do not want to hinder men's bu&s;ine&s;s; tho&s;e that have mo&s;t money and mo&s;t power, if they acted as they ought to do, would be the greate&s;t &s;laves to their fel|low-creatures. When I talk of loving the world, I mean an inordinate love: I may live in the world and not live upon it; my heart may be towards God: the love of the world is to be renounced, and therefore they will not come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t they think, till they are going out of the world. If you are one of tho&s;e who hate Chri&s;t, why you are the man that will not come to him: why, &s;ay you, does any body hate Chri&s;t? pray hold your

But, my dear &s;oul learn from this time forward, that every one of us by nature hates Je&s;us Chri&s;t: we &s;ent this me&s;&s;age to him; we will not have this man to reign over us, we hate him becau&s;e he is de&s;pi&s;ed, we hate him becau&s;e of the appearance of the people that are his followers, we hate him becau&s;e of the narrowne&s;s of the way we are to pa&s;s in to him, becau&s;e we mu&s;t part with our lu&s;ts; we hate him becau&s;e we mu&s;t be non-conformi&s;ts: I hate that rag of the whore of Babylon, O that form of prayer, O all that &s;tuff, I thank God I was born a Di&s;&s;enter, I love to be a Puritan, I don't love rites and ceremonies, no not in the church, and yet, perhaps, are more conformed to the world than num|bers of the church, and have nothing but rites and ceremonies about their hou&s;es and families. What do we more than others? a churchman &s;hould prove him&s;elf a church|man, by having his articles, and keeping up the practice of religion; and a Di&s;&s;enter &s;hould prove him&s;elf one, not by di&s;&s;enting from the church, but from the <HI>lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;ts of the eye, and the pride of life,</HI> and then we &s;hall agree very well together, though one went to a place called a church, and another to a place called a meeting: would to God every &s;oul now pre&s;ent would put this que&s;tion to him&s;elf, Am I come to Chri&s;t, or am I not?

<P>I REMEMBER an ingenious writer, who had been very copious in his publications, ob&s;erved, that the be&s;t and mo&s;t profitable were written after he was fifty years of age: It is &s;uppo&s;ed, then the judgment is ripened, and the genius is as it were advanced to ma|turity and knowledge; and experiences ga|thered when young, will be more u&s;eful in the decline of life, when grey hairs are &s;een here and there upon them. It is &s;aid indeed, that old men are twice children; but there are &s;ome who&s;e geniu&s;&s;es are &s;o very low that they cannot be twice children, becau&s;e they are no better than children from their cradle to their grave; but this is not the ca&s;e with God's children, for upon a reflection of the wrong &s;teps they have taken, if it proceeds from the &s;anctified &s;en&s;e of afflictions, they &s;erve to

make them more in&s;tructive in their latter day. This was the ca&s;e of Solomon, though highly favoured when young, for the Lord appeared unto him twice, yet he fell mo&s;t aw|fully, and had we not read of his recovery a|gain, the doctrine of the final per&s;everance of the &s;aints, mu&s;t &s;eem to fall to the ground, but we have rea&s;on to think that he was re&s;to|red, and gave evidence of his recovery by writing in &s;uch a manner, that none could but one that knew much of God and him&s;elf; witne&s;s the book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, which in all ages of the church has been received with a peculiar re&s;pect. Eccle&s;ia&s;tes &s;ignifies a preacher, &s;uch Solomon was from his own experience, and exceeded by none but him <HI>who &s;pake as no man ever did.</HI></P>
<P>The chapter in which is the text, de&s;cribes the vanity and mi&s;ery of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, if un&s;anctified. <HI>There is an evil,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that I have &s;een under the &s;un, and it is common a|mong men:</HI> though he is going about to de&s;|cribe a mon&s;ter, yet it is a mon&s;ter that walks and &s;talks abroad, a man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honor, &s;o that he wanteth nothing for his &s;oul of all that he de&s;ireth, though God gives him not power to eat, this is vanity and a great di&s;ea&s;e.

all the inhabitants under heaven, once to die; and therefore the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Death hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, even upon tho&s;e who have not &s;inned after the &s;imilitude of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of Adam,</HI> that is, who have not been guilty of actual &s;in. Can there be a &s;tronger proof of the imputation of Adam's guilt, of original &s;in, or a more cutting trial that a tender father and nur&s;ing mother can undergo, than to &s;ee a dear little child ju&s;t born, or but lent to the loving parents for a few months, taken away often in the greate&s;t agonies that we can con|ceive? and if God, my dear hearers, has ever &s;uffered your dear children &s;uddenly to be &s;ei|zed with convul&s;ions, and continue in angui&s;h and agonizing pains for many days together, you have had &s;ufficient proof of it. A friend of mine in London, about thirty-two years ago, that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of every child he had, to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> from Georgia, be|ginning with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e words, Is your Idol dead yet? for I thought it was &s;uch an idol that would &s;oon go. The account he gave me the fir&s;t time I &s;aw him was, that the day before my letter was received, the child died in &s;uch agony and torture, that its excrements came out of its mouth, which made the fond and too indulgent parent wi&s;h to have rather died a thou&s;and deaths him&s;elf, than that his child &s;hould die in &s;uch a way; and added, I was obliged to go to God, and de&s;ire him to take my darling away. What an awful proof are their &s;ufferings, that children come into the

world with a corruption that renders them lia|ble to God's wrath and damnation, but the blood, the precious blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it is to be hoped clean&s;es them from the guilt and filth of &s;in. So any of you that have got children dead in infancy, O may you improve what I &s;hall &s;ay by and by from the text, and pray endeavour to go to that place, where I hope you will &s;ee your children making a ble&s;&s;|ed con&s;tellation in the firmament of heaven: in this re&s;pect all go to the &s;ame place, &s;ome at the beginning of life, &s;ome at the middle, and &s;ome at the decline; and happy, happy they who go to bed &s;oone&s;t, if their &s;ouls are &s;aved!</P>
<P>But, my dear hearers, in another ca&s;e we may venture to contradict even Solomon; for if we con&s;ider the words of our text in anoth|er view, all do not go to one place; it is true, all are buried in the grave either of earth or water, but then after death comes judgment; death gives the deci&s;ive, the &s;eparating blow. Suppo&s;e then in our enlarging on the text we &s;hould confine the word to all the unregener|ate, and to tho&s;e who are not born of God, the&s;e indeed, die when they will, all go to one place. If you &s;hould a&s;k me, for I love dear|ly to have an inqui&s;itive auditory, who I mean by unregenerate? who I mean by tho&s;e that are not born of God? I an&s;wer, I do not mean all that only bear the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I mention this, becau&s;e a great many people think that all that are baptized, either when
<PB N="283" REF="033217_0290_0FF691202DC8C3A0">
they are adult or when they are young, wheth|er &s;prinkled or put under water, I believe a great many people think that all the&s;e go to heaven. I remember when I began to &s;peak again&s;t bapti&s;mal regeneration in my fir&s;t &s;er|mon, printed when I was about twenty-two years old, or a little more; the fir&s;t quarrel many had with me was, becau&s;e I did not &s;ay that all people who were baptized, were born again; I would as &s;oon believe the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. Can I believe that a per&s;on who gives no evidence of being a &s;aint, from the time of his bapti&s;m to the time per|haps of his death, that never fights again&s;t the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil, and never minds one word of what his god-fathers and god-mo|thers promi&s;ed for him, can I believe that per|&s;on is a real Chri&s;tian! no, I can as &s;oon be|lieve, that a little wafer in the prie&s;ts hand, a|bout a quarter of an inch long, is the very blood and bones of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was hung upon the cro&s;s without the gates of Je|ru&s;alem. I do believe bapti&s;m to be an or|dinance of Chri&s;t, but at the &s;ame time, no candid per&s;on can be angry for my a&s;&s;erting, that there are numbers that have been baptiz|ed when grown up, or when very young, that are not regenerated by God's Spirit, who will all go to one place, and that place is where there will be no water to quench that dread|ful fire that will parch them with thir&s;t. I am &s;peaking out of a book which contains the lively oracles of God, and in the name of one

O that curio&s;ity may be over|ruled for good to &s;ome of you to-night: but I forgot my&s;elf, and can you blame me if I &s;hould detain you a little, though I am really afraid of unfitting my&s;elf for my voyage, if I tire my&s;elf before I go: to-morrow I am to go to &s;ee where I am to &s;leep. I intend, God willing, to have a &s;acrament here to-morrow, and another next Sabbath day morning. I

intend, God willing, to give you a parting word on Sunday evening, and give you notice of taking my la&s;t farewel in the week, for I mu&s;t get a day or two to di&s;patch my private bu&s;ine&s;s, and be ready to go where my God calleth me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, I think, be called to do &s;omething which I would, if po&s;&s;ible, have avoided, and that is, as this place has been repaired, you &s;ee 'tis fre&s;h done, which is expen&s;ive, and I am willing to leave every thing clear before I go, a collection mu&s;t be made for defraying the charge. The world thinks I am very rich; a man, the other day, was &s;o per&s;uaded of my riches, that he &s;ent me word, if I did not lay thirty pounds in &s;uch a place, I &s;hould be killed as &s;ure as I am alive; but, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I am alive yet; I do not fear dying &s;uddenly, or being di&s;patched by a poignard, or a pi&s;tol to make a pa&s;&s;age for my &s;oul to flee to God. You may think, perhaps, I get a great deal by preaching here; and now I am going away, what do you think my &s;tated allowance is for preaching at the Tabernacle? I have no more from this place than one hun|dred pounds a year; and I a&s;ked but la&s;t night how it &s;tood, and in&s;tead of having a &s;ingle &s;ix-pence, I was told there were fifty pounds arrears; well, &s;aid I, ungrateful as it is to me, I will make a collection to-night that all may be left free; and if others are left to make an advantage of it, may God make it a ble&s;&s;ing. There are not &s;ix people in this

<P>I LATELY had occa&s;ion to &s;peak on the ver&s;e immediately following that of our text; but when I am reading God's word, I often find it is like being in a tempting gar|den, when we pluck a little fruit and find it good, we are apt to look after and pluck a little more, only with this difference, the fruit we gather below often hurts the body at the &s;ame time that it plea&s;es the appetite, but when we walk in God's garden, when we gather fruit of the Redeemer's plants, the more we eat the more we are delighted, and the freer we are the more welcome; if any chapter in the bible de&s;erves this character and de&s;cription of an evangelical Eden, this does.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, and I have often told you of it, that all the apo&s;tles preach fir&s;t the law, and then the go&s;pel, which finds man in

a &s;tate of death, points out to him how he is to get life, and then &s;weetly conducts him to it. Great and glorious things are &s;poken of the church of God in this chapter; and it &s;truck me very much this evening ever &s;ince I came into the pulpit, that the great God &s;peaks of the church in the &s;ingular number: how can that be, when the church is compo&s;|ed of &s;o many millions gathered out of all na|tions, languages, and tongues? how is it, that God &s;ays thy maker and not your maker, that he &s;peaks of the church as though it con&s;i&s;ted only of one individual per&s;on? the rea&s;on of it is this, and is very obvious, that though the church is compo&s;ed of many members, they have but one Head, and they are united by the bond of one Spirit, by whom they have the &s;ame vital union of the &s;oul with God; and therefore it teaches Chri&s;tians not to &s;ay to one another, <HI>I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, or Cepha,</HI> but to behave &amp; live &s;o, that the world may know that we all belong to one common Chri&s;t: God revive, continue, and increa&s;e this true Chri&s;tian love among us! Of this church, thus collectively con&s;idered, united under one head, the ble&s;&s;ed evangelical proph|et thus &s;peaks, <HI>Violence &s;hall no more be heard in thy land, wa&s;ting nor de&s;truction within thy borders, but thou &s;halt call thy walls &s;alvation, and thy gates,</HI> where the magi&s;trates a&s;&s;emble, and the people go in and out, <HI>prai&s;e.</HI> From this text, a great many good and great men have gathered what they call the Millenium,
<PB N="303" REF="033217_0310_0FF6914877D24498">
that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is to come and reign a thou|&s;and years on earth, but I mu&s;t acknowledge that I have always rejected a great many good mens po&s;itive opinion about the &s;ea&s;on when this &s;tate commences, and I would warn you all again&s;t fixing any time; for what &s;ignifies whether Chri&s;t comes to reign a thou&s;and years, or when he comes, &s;ince you and I are to die very &s;oon; and therefore in&s;tead of puzzling our heads about it, God grant we may live &s;o that we may reign with him for ever; and it &s;eems to me, that what&s;oever is &s;aid of this &s;tate on earth, that the millenium is to be under&s;tood in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, as an emblem of a glorious, eternal, beatific &s;tate in the kingdom of heaven. <HI>The &s;un &s;hall no more be thy light by day, nor for brightne&s;s &s;hall the moon give light unto thee, but the Lord &s;hall be unto thee an everla&s;ting light;</HI> and in order to prepare us for that light, and &s;how us the na|ture of it, while we &s;peak of it may it come with light and power to our &s;ouls.

to all eternity. He that hath an ear to hear let him hear what the evangelic prophet &s;aith, <HI>thy God thy glory.</HI></P>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t &s;eems, as it were, partic|ularly fond of this expre&s;&s;ion; when God publi&s;hed the ten commandments upon mount Sinai, he prefaced it thus, <HI>I am the Lord,</HI> and not content with that, he adds, <HI>thy God:</HI> and the frequency of it, I &s;uppo&s;e, made Luther &s;ay, that <HI>the go&s;pel deals much in pronouns, in which con&s;i&s;ts a believer's comfort;</HI> but if there were no other argument than this, it would cut up that de&s;tructive principle by the very root that pretends to tell us that there is no &s;uch thing as appropriation in the Bible; that our faith is only to be a rational a&s;&s;ent to the word of God, without a particular application of that word made to our &s;ouls: this is as contrary to the go&s;pel, and to experience of every real &s;aint, as light is contrary to dark|ne&s;s and heaven to hell. My brethren, I ap|peal to any of you, what good would it do you, if you had ten thou&s;and notes wrote in large characters by the fine&s;t hand that can write in London; &s;uppo&s;e you have got them, as ma|ny men have, and it is a very convenient way, that they were put into your little pockets made on the in&s;ide of your coat; &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould &s;ay, my coat is buttoned, I have all the&s;e here next my heart: when I come to look at them, I find there is not one note pay|able to me, they are either all forged, or pay|able to &s;ome body el&s;e, and therefore are good

for nothing to me. All the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, all that is &s;aid of God and Chri&s;t is ours. The great que&s;tion therefore is, wheth|er the God we profe&s;s to believe in, is our God? not only, whether he is &s;o in general, that the devils may &s;ay; but whether he is our God in particular. The devils can &s;ay, O God; but the devils cannot &s;ay, my God: that is a privilege peculiar to God's cho&s;en people, who really believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and therefore, my brethren, a dei&s;t cannot &s;ay, my God, my Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he does not believe on that medium by which God becomes our God. That was a noble &s;aying of Luther, "I will have nothing to do with an ab&s;olute God;" that is, I will have nothing to do with a God out of Chri&s;t. Now this is a dei&s;t's glory: Lord B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lingbroke val|ues him&s;elf upon it, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at that man's infidelity and cowardice.

another replies, where do you think but to hell. God grant that may not be the portion of any here!</P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is, how God is our God; <HI>thy God.</HI> My brethren, our all depends upon it; what &s;ignifies &s;aying, this is mine, and that is mine, if you cannot &s;ay, God is mine. The be&s;t thing that God has left in the New Te&s;ta|ment, is him&s;elf: <HI>I will be their God,</HI> that is one of the legacies; and <HI>a new heart al&s;o will I give them,</HI> that is another; <HI>I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts,</HI> that is another: but all that is good for noth|ing, comparatively &s;peaking, unle&s;s God has &s;aid at the &s;ame time, for they are all in&s;epa|rable, <HI>I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people.</HI> Now how &s;hall I know that God is my God? I am afraid, &s;ome people think there is no knowing; well then, if you think &s;o, you &s;et up a wor&s;hip, and go and erect an altar, and in&s;tead of receiving God in the &s;acra|ment as yours, go and wor&s;hip an unknown God. I am &s;o far from believing, that we cannot know that God is ours, that I am ful|ly per&s;uaded of it, and would &s;peak it with humility, and I would not chu&s;e to leave you with a lie in my mouth, that I have known it for about thirty-five years as clear as the &s;un is in the meridian, that God is my God. And how &s;hall I know it, my brethren? I would a&s;k you this que&s;tion, did&s;t thou ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> feel the want of God to be thy God?

him to be his God in Chri&s;t: out of Chri&s;t, God is a con&s;uming fire. I know there are a great variety of ways in peoples conver&s;ions, but &s;till, my brethren, we mu&s;t all feel our mi&s;ery, we mu&s;t all feel our di&s;tance from God, all feel that we are e&s;tranged from God, that we bring into the world with us a nature that is not agreeable to the law of God, nor po&s;&s;ibly can be; we cannot be &s;aid to believe that God is our God, till we are brought to be reconciled to him through his Son. Can I &s;ay, a per&s;on is my friend, till I am reconciled to him? and therefore the go&s;pel only is the mini&s;tration of reconciliation. Paul &s;aith, <HI>We be&s;eech you as amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, that you would be reconciled unto God:</HI> this is to be the grand topic of our preaching; we are to be|&s;eech them, and God him&s;elf turns beggar to his own creatures to be reconciled to him: now this reconciliation is brought about by a poor &s;inner's being brought to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and when once he &s;ees his enmity and hatred to God, feeling the mi&s;ery of departing from him, and being con&s;cious that he is obnoxious to eternal wrath, flies to Je&s;us as to a place of refuge, and expects only a reconciliation thro' the blood of the Lamb; without this, neither you nor I can &s;ay, God is my God: <HI>there is no peace, &s;aith my God, to the wicked.</HI> The mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t mu&s;t take care they don't preach an unknown God, and we mu&s;t take care we don't pretend to live upon an un|known God, a God that is not appropriated

and brought home to our &s;ouls by the efficacy of the Spirit. But, my brethren, we cannot &s;ay, God is our God, unle&s;s we are in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Can you &s;ay, &s;uch a one is your fath|er, unle&s;s you can give proof of it? You may be ba&s;tards, there are many ba&s;tards laid at Chri&s;t's door. Now, God cannot be my God, at lea&s;t I cannot know him to be &s;o, unle&s;s he is plea&s;ed to &s;end into my heart the &s;pirit of adoption, and to admit me to enjoy familiari|ty with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>My brethren, I told you the other night that the grand controver&s;y God has with En|gland is for the &s;light put on the Holy Gho&s;t. As &s;oon as a per&s;on begins to talk of the work of the Holy Gho&s;t, they cry, you are a meth|odi&s;t: as &s;oon as you &s;peak about the divine influences of the Holy Gho&s;t, O! &s;ay they, you are an enthu&s;ia&s;t. May the Lord keep the&s;e methodi&s;tical enthu&s;ia&s;ts among&s;t us to the late&s;t po&s;terity. Ignatius, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been one of the children that Je&s;us took up in his arms, in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle (pray read it) wrote &s;oon after St. John's death, and we value nothing &s;o authentic as what was wrote in the three fir&s;t centuries, bears a noble te&s;|timony to this truth. When I was perform|ing my fir&s;t exerci&s;es at Oxford, I u&s;ed to take delight to walk and read it, and could not help noting and putting down from time to time &s;everal remarkable pa&s;&s;ages. In the &s;u|per&s;cription of all his Epi&s;tles, I remember, he &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>Theophoros,</HI> i. e. Bearer of God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erens, <HI>in&s;pired, divine, holy.</HI></NOTE>,

and believed that tho&s;e he wrote to, were &s;o too. Some body went and told Trajan, that one Ignatius was an enthu&s;ia&s;t, that he carried God about him: being brought before the emperor, who, though in other re&s;pects a good prince, was a cruel enemy to the Chri&s;tians: but many a good prince does bad things by the influence of wicked coun&s;ellors, like our king Henry the Vth, who was brought in to per&s;ecute the poor Lollards, for a&s;&s;embling in St. Giles's fields to hear the pure go&s;pel, by fal&s;e accu&s;ation of being rebels again&s;t him. Before &s;uch a prince was Ignatius brought; &s;ays Trajan who is this that calls him&s;elf a <HI>bearer of God?</HI> &s;ays Ignatius, I am he, for which he quotes this pa&s;&s;age, <HI>I will dwell in them, and will walk in them, and they &s;hall be my &s;ons and daughters, &s;ays the Lord Almighty.</HI> The emperor was &s;o enraged that, in order to cure him of his enthu&s;ia&s;m, he ordered him to be devoured by lions; at which Ignatius laughed for joy: O! &s;ays he, am I going to be devoured? and when his friends came a|bout him, he almo&s;t danced for gladne&s;s; when they carried him to execution, he &s;miled, and turning about, &s;aid, now I begin to be a martyr of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! I have heard that the lions have leaped from the martyrs, but when they come to me, I will encourage them to fall on me with all their violence. God give you &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;m in a trying hour! This is to have God for our God: <HI>he that believeth hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf,</HI> as it is written in

this ble&s;&s;ed word of God, and I hope it will be the la&s;t book that I &s;hall read. Farewel father, farewel mother, farewel &s;un, moon, and &s;tars! was the language of one of the Scotch martyrs in king Charles's time, and it is amazing to me that even Mr. Hume (I be|lieve) a profe&s;&s;ed dei&s;t, in his Hi&s;tory of En|gland mentions this as a grand exit, and al&s;o that &s;eraphic &s;oul Mr. Hervey, now with God, that the la&s;t words of the martyr were, Fare|wel thou precious Bible, thou ble&s;&s;ed book of God. This is my rock, this is my founda|tion, it is now about thirty-five years &s;ince I have begun to read the bible upon my pillow. I love to read this book, but the book is nothing but an account of the promi&s;es which it contains, and almo&s;t every word from the beginning to the end of it &s;peaks of a &s;piritu|al di&s;pen&s;ation, and the Holy Gho&s;t, that u|nites our &s;ouls to God, and helps a believer to &s;ay, my Lord and my God! If you content your&s;elves with that, the devil will let you talk of doctrines enough: O you &s;hall turn from Arminiani&s;m to Calvini&s;m; O you &s;hall be orthodox enough, if you will be content to live without Chri&s;t's living in you. Now when you have got the Spirit, then you may &s;ay, God is mine. O this is very fine, &s;ay &s;ome, every body pretends to the Spirit: and then you may go on as a bi&s;hop once told a nobleman, My Lord, the&s;e methodi&s;ts, &s;ay they, do all by the Spirit, &s;o if the devil bids them murder any body, they will &s;ay, the Spir|it

it bid them do it; and that very bi&s;hop died, how? why horrid! the la&s;t words he &s;poke were the&s;e, <HI>The battle is fought, the battle is fought, the battle is fought, but the victory is lo&s;t for ever.</HI> God grant, you and I may not die with &s;uch words as the&s;e. I hope you and I &s;hall die and &s;ay, <HI>The battle is fought, the bat|tle is fought, the battle is fought, I have fought the good fight, and the victory is gained for ever.</HI> Thus died Mr. Ralph Er&s;kine, his la&s;t words were, Victory, victory, victory! and they that can call God their God, &s;hall by and by cry, Victory, victory! and that for ever. God grant, we may all be of that happy number.</P>
<P>If we can call God our God, we &s;hall endea|vour by the Holy Gho&s;t to be like God, we &s;hall have his divine image &s;tamped upon our &s;ouls, and endeavour to be followers of that God who is our Father: and this brings in the other part of the text, <HI>thy God, thy Glory.</HI> What is that? The greate&s;t honor that a poor believ|er thinks he can have on earth, is to boa&s;t that God is his God. When it was propo&s;d to David, that if he killed an hundred Phili&s;tines, he &s;hould have the king's daughter for his wife, and a very &s;orry wife &s;he was, no great gain turned out to him: &s;ays he, <HI>do you think it is a &s;mall thing to be the &s;on-in-law to a king?</HI> a poor &s;trippling as I am here come with my &s;hepherd's crook, what! to be married to a king's daughter, do you think that is a &s;mall thing? and if David thought it no &s;mall thing to be allied to a king by his daughter, what
<PB N="312" REF="033217_0319_0FF6916342892F68">
a great thing mu&s;t it be to be allied to the Lord by one &s;pirit? I am afraid there are &s;ome people that were once poor that are now rich, that think it a great thing, that wi&s;h, O that my family had a coat of arms; &s;ome people would give a thou&s;and pounds, I believe, for one. Coats of arms are very proper to make di&s;tinction in life, a great many people wear coats of arms that their ance&s;tors got honor|ably, but they are a di&s;grace to them as they wear them on their coaches. But this is our glory, whether we walk or ride, whatever our pedigree may be in life, this is our honor that our God may be our glory. <HI>O what manner of love is this,</HI> &s;aith one, <HI>that the Lord doth be|&s;tow on us, that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God!</HI> born not of the will of man, born not of fle&s;h, but born from above. O God grant that this may be your glory and mine!</P>
<P>My brethren, if God is our God and our glory, I'll tell you what we &s;hall prove it by: whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we &s;hould do all to the glory of God. Reli|gion, as I have often told you, turns our whole life into one continued &s;acrifice of love to God. As a needle when once touched by a load&s;tone, turns to a particular pole, &s;o the heart that is touched by the love of God, turns to his God again. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to take notice of it by and by, when I am a|board a &s;hip: for as &s;oon as I get on board I generally place my&s;elf in one particular place under the compa&s;s that hangs over my head, I
<PB N="313" REF="033217_0320_0FF691650BB6B7E0">
often look at it by night and by day; when I ri&s;e the needle turns to one point, when I go to bed I find it turns to the &s;ame point: and often, while I have been looking at it, my heart has been turned to God, &s;aying, Lord Je&s;us, as that needle touched by the load&s;tone, turns to one point, O may my heart touched by the magnet of God's love, turn to him! A great many people think, they never wor&s;hip God but when at church; and a great many are very demure on Lord's days, though many begin to leave that off. I know of no place upon the face of the earth where the Sabbath is kept as it is in Bo&s;ton: if a &s;ingle per&s;on was to walk in Bo&s;ton &s;treets in time of wor&s;hip, he would be taken up; it is not tru&s;ted to poor in&s;ignificant men, but the ju&s;tices go out in time of wor&s;hip, they walk with a white wand, and if they catch any per&s;on walking in the &s;treets, they put them under a black rod. O! the great mi&s;|chiefs the poor pious people have &s;uffered late|ly through the town's being di&s;turbed by the &s;oldiers! When the drums were beating be|fore the hou&s;e of Dr. Sawell, one of the holi|e&s;t men that ever was, when he was &s;ick and dying, on the &s;abbath day, by his meeting, where the noi&s;e of a &s;ingle per&s;on was never heard before, and he begged that for Chri&s;t's &s;ake they would not beat the drum; they damned and &s;aid, that they would beat to make him wor&s;e; this is not acting for the glory of God; but when a &s;oul is turned to

God, every day is a &s;abbath, every meal is a &s;piritual refre&s;hment, and every &s;entence he &s;peaks, &s;hould be a &s;ermon; and whether he &s;tays abroad or at home, whether he is on the exchange, or locked up in a clo&s;et, he can &s;ay, O God, thou art my God!</P>
<P>Now, my dear friends, can you, dare you &s;ay, that your God is your glory, and do you aim at glorifying the Lord your God: if your God is your glory, then &s;ay, <HI>O God forbid that I &s;hould glory &s;ave in the cro&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I am crucified to the world.</HI> What &s;ay you to that now? don't talk of God's being your glory, if you don't love his cro&s;s. If God is our glory, we &s;hall glory not only in doing, but in &s;uffering for him; we &s;hall glory in tribulation, and count our&s;elves mo&s;t highly honored when we are called to &s;uffer mo&s;t for his great name &s;ake. I might enlarge, but you may ea&s;ily judge by my poor feeble voice this la&s;t week, that neither my &s;trength of voice, or body, will permit me to be long to-night, and yet I will venture to give you your la&s;t parting &s;alutation; and though I have been di&s;&s;uaded from getting up to preach this night, yet I thought as my God was my glory, I &s;hould glory in preaching till I died. O that God may be all our glory! All our own glory fades away, there is nothing will be valuable at the great day but this, Thou art my God, and thou art my glory. It was a glorious turn that good Mr. Shepherd of Brad|ford

mentions in one of his &s;ermons, where he repre&s;ents Je&s;us Chri&s;t as coming to judgment &s;eated upon his throne, in a &s;ermon preached before &s;ome mini&s;ters. Chri&s;t calls one min|i&s;ter to him, Pray what brought you into the church? O, &s;ays he, Lord, there was a living in the family, and I was pre&s;ented to it becau&s;e it was a family living: &s;tand thou by, &s;ays Chri&s;t. A &s;econd comes, What did&s;t thou enter into the church for? O Lord, &s;ays he, I had a fine elocution, I had pretty parts, and I went into the church to &s;hew my oratory and my parts: &s;tand thou by, thou ha&s;t thy reward. A third was called, And what brought you into the church? Lord, &s;ays he, thou knowe&s;t all things, thou knowe&s;t that I am a poor creature, vile and mi&s;erable, and unwor|thy, and helple&s;s, but I appeal to thee my glory, thou &s;itte&s;t upon the throne, that thy glory and the good of &s;ouls brought me there: Chri&s;t immediately &s;ays, Make room, men, make room, angels, and bring up that &s;oul to &s;it near me on my throne. Thus &s;hall it be done to all that make God their glory here below. Glorify God on earth, and he will glorify you in heaven. <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</HI> &s;hall be your portion: and if &s;o, Lord God almighty make us content to be vilified whil&s;t here, make us content to be de&s;pi&s;ed while below, make us content to have evil things &s;poken of us, all for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, yet a little while, and Chri&s;t

O that &s;oul tran&s;porting thought! it is enough to make us leap into a fiery furnace; in this &s;pirit, in this temper, may God put every one of us.</P>
<P>If there be any of you that have not yet called God your God, may God help you to do &s;o to-night. When I was rea&s;oning with|in my&s;elf, whether I &s;hould come up, or whe|ther it was my duty or not? I could not help thinking, who knows but God will ble&s;s a poor feeble worm to night. I remember, a dear friend &s;ent me word after I was gone to Georgia, <Q>Your la&s;t &s;ermon at the Tabernacle was ble&s;&s;ed to a particular per&s;on;</Q> I heard from that per&s;on to-day, and who knows but &s;ome may come to day, and &s;ay, I will go and hear what the babler has to &s;ay; who knows but curio&s;ity may be over-ruled for good? who knows but tho&s;e that have &s;erved the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h and the pride of life for their god, may now take the Lord to be their God? O! if I could but &s;ee this, I think I could drop down dead for you.</P>
<P>My dear Chri&s;tians, will you not help me to-night, you that can go and call God your God? go and beg of God for me, pray to heaven for me, do pray for tho&s;e that are in the gall of bitterne&s;s, that have no God, no Chri&s;t to go to, and if they were to die to|night, would be damned forever.

Tho' the &s;un is going down, tho' the &s;hadow of the evening is coming on, God is willing, O man, God is willing, O woman, to be a &s;inner's God, he has found out a way whereby he can be reconciled to you.

being often the effects of a peculiar di&s;order of body, or owing to &s;ome di&s;turbance of the mind. They who&s;e nervous &s;y&s;tem has been long relaxed, who have had &s;evere dome&s;tic trials, or have been greatly affected by extra|ordinary occurrences, know this to be true by their own experience; but however this may be, there have been, and po&s;&s;ibly may be &s;till, dreams that have no manner of dependance on the indi&s;po&s;ition of the body, or other nat|ural cau&s;e, but &s;eem to bring a divine &s;anc|tion with them, and make peculiar impre&s;&s;ions on the party, though this was more frequent before the canon of &s;cripture was clo&s;ed, than now. God &s;poke to his people in a dream, in a vi&s;ion of the night; witne&s;s, the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent meditation, a dream of the pa|triarch Jacob's, when going forth as a poor pilgrim with a &s;taff in his hand, from his fath|er's hou&s;e, deprived of his mother's company and in&s;truction, per&s;ecuted by an elder broth|er, without attendants or nece&s;&s;aries, only leaning on an invi&s;ible power. I need not in|form you in how extraordinary a way he got the ble&s;&s;ing, which provoked his brother to &s;uch a degree, as determined him to be the death of Jacob, as &s;oon as ever his aged father dropp'd: to what a height did this wicked man's envy ri&s;e when he &s;aid, <HI>the days of mourn|ing for my father will &s;oon come,</HI> and what then? why, though I have &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for the old man, and therefore will not lay violent hands upon my brother while my father is a|live,
<PB N="323" REF="033217_0330_0FF6917C5F1DDDB8">
yet I am re&s;olved to kill him before my father is cold in his grave. This is the very &s;pirit of Cain, who talked to his brother, and then &s;lew him: this coming to the ears of his mother, &s;he tells the good old patriarch her hu&s;band, who loving peace and quietne&s;s, takes the good advice of the weaker ve&s;&s;el, and orders Jacob to go to his mother's broth|er, Laban, and &s;tay a little while out of E&s;au's &s;ight, (perhaps out of &s;ight out of mind) and by and by probably, &s;aid he, thou may&s;t come to thy father and mother again in peace and &s;afety. Jacob, though &s;ure of the ble&s;&s;ing in the end, by his father's confirmation of it, yet prudently makes u&s;e of proper means; there|fore he obeyed his parents: and wo, wo be to tho&s;e who think a parent's ble&s;&s;ing not worth their a&s;king for! Having had his mother's ble&s;&s;ing, as well as his father's, without &s;aying, I will try it out with my brother, I will let him know that I am not afraid of him, he views it as the call of God, and like an hone&s;t, &s;imple pilgrim, went out from Beer&s;heba to|wards Haran. Was it not a little unkind in his parents not to furni&s;h him with &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences? When the &s;er|vant was &s;ent to fetch a wife for I&s;aac, he had a great deal of attendance, why &s;hould not Jacob have it now; his father might have &s;ent him away with great parade: but I am apt to believe this did not &s;uit Jacob's real, pilgrim &s;pirit; he was a plain man, and dwelt in tents, when, perhaps, he might have dwelt
<PB N="324" REF="033217_0331_0FF6917EB5C0CDA0">
under cedar roofs; he cho&s;e a pilgrim's life, and prudence directed him to go thus in a private manner, to prevent increa&s;ing E&s;au's envy, and giving the fatal blow.</P>
<P>Methinks, I &s;ee the young pilgrim weeping when he took his leave of his father and moth|er; he went on foot, and they that are ac|quainted with the geography of the place, &s;ay that the fir&s;t day of his journey he walked not le&s;s than forty Engli&s;h miles; what exer|ci&s;e mu&s;t he have had all that way; no won|der, therefore, that by the time the &s;un was going down, poor Jacob felt him&s;elf very wea|ry, for we are told, ver. 11, <HI>that he lighted on a certain place, and tarried there all night, be|cau&s;e the &s;un was &s;et.</HI> There is a particular empha&s;is to be put upon this term, <HI>a certain place;</HI> he &s;aw the &s;un going down, he was a &s;tranger in a &s;trange land. (You that are born in England can have very little idea of it, but per&s;ons that travel in the American woods can form a more proper idea, for you may there travel a hundred and a thou&s;and miles, and go through one continued tract of tall green trees, like the tall cedars of Leba|non; and the gentlemen of America, from one end to the other, are of &s;uch an ho&s;pita|ble temper, as I have not only been told, but have found among them upwards of thirty years, that they would not let public hou&s;es be licen&s;ed, that they may have an op|portunity of entertaining Engli&s;h friends: may God, of his infinite mercy, grant this union may never be di&s;&s;olved.)</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="033217_0332_0FF69180D63F3C78">
Well, Jacob got to a certain place, and perhaps he &s;aw a good tree that would &s;erve him for a canopy; however, this we are told, he tarried there all night becau&s;e the &s;un was &s;et, and he took of the &s;tones of that place and put them for his pillow, and laid down in that place to &s;leep; hard lodgings for him who was u&s;ed to lie otherwi&s;e at home: I don't hear him &s;ay, I wi&s;h I was got back to my mother again, I wi&s;h I had not &s;et out; but upon the hard ground and hard pillow he lies down; I believe never poor man &s;lept &s;weeter in his life, for it is certainly &s;weet &s;leep when God is near us; he did not know but his brother might follow and kill him while he was a&s;leep, or that the wild bea&s;ts might devour him; (in America, when they &s;leep in the woods, and I expect to have &s;ome &s;uch &s;leeping-times in them before a twelve|month is over, we are obliged to make a fire to keep the bea&s;ts from us: I have often &s;aid then, and I hope I &s;hall never forget it, when I ri&s;e in the morning, this fire in the woods that keeps the wild bea&s;ts from hurting us, is like the fire of God's love that keeps the devil from hurting us:) thus weary and &s;olitary he falls a&s;leep, and &s;weetly dreams, <HI>and behold;</HI> I don't remember many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture where the word <HI>behold</HI> is repeated &s;o many times in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace as in the pa&s;&s;age be|fore us, doubtle&s;s, the Lord would have us particularly take notice of it, even us upon whom the ends of the world are come: Be|hold,
<PB N="326" REF="033217_0333_0FF6918345836850">
hold, <HI>a ladder &s;et upon the earth, and the top reached to heaven; and</HI> behold, <HI>the angels of God a&s;cending and de&s;cending upon it; and</HI> be|hold, <HI>the Lord &s;tood above it;</HI> &s;o here are three <HI>beholds</HI> in a very few lines. Was there any thing very extraordinary in that? per|haps the Dei&s;ts would &s;ay, your patriarch was tired, and dreamed among other things of a ladder; yes, he did, but this dream was of God, and how kind was he to meet him at the end of the fir&s;t day's journey, to &s;trength|en and animate him to go forward in this lone&s;ome pilgrimage!</P>
<P>This ladder is reckoned by &s;ome to denote the providence of God: it was let down as it were from heaven, particularly at this time to poor Jacob, that he might know that howev|er he was become a pilgrim, and left his all, all for God's glory, that God would take care for his comfort, and give his angels charge over him to keep him in all his ways, which was denoted by the angels a&s;cending and de|&s;cending upon the ladder. Some think that particular &s;aints and countries have particular guardian angels, and therefore that the angels that a&s;cended were tho&s;e that had the particu|lar charge of that place, &s;o far as Jacob had come; that the angels that de&s;cended were another &s;et of angels, &s;ent down from heaven to guard him in his future journey; perhaps, this is more a fancy than the word of God. However, I very much like the ob&s;ervation of good Mr. Burket, <Q>Why &s;hould we di&s;|pute
<PB N="327" REF="033217_0334_0FF6918669E99570">
whether every individual believer has got a particular angel, when there is not one believer but has got guards of angels to attend him,</Q> which are a great deal better than a great many &s;ervants, that prove our plagues, and in&s;tead of waiting upon us make us wait upon them.</P>
<P>But, my dear hearers, I don't know one &s;piritual commentator, but agrees that this ladder was a type of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that as Jacob was now bani&s;hed from his father's hou&s;e, and while &s;leeping upon a hard, cold &s;tone, God was plea&s;ed not only to give him an a&s;&s;urance that he would be with him in the way, but gave him a ble&s;&s;ed &s;ight of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom Jacob believed.</P>
<P>A ladder you know is &s;omething by which we climb from one place to another; hence, in conde&s;cen&s;ion to our weak capacities, God ordered a ladder to be let down, to &s;hew us that Chri&s;t is the way to heaven: <HI>I am the way, the truth, and the life: I am the door,</HI> &s;ays he; neither is there &s;alvation in any oth|er, for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved. The De|i&s;ts, who own a God but deny his Son, dare go to a God out of Chri&s;t; but Jacob is here taught better: how &s;oon does God reveal the go&s;pel unto him; here is a ladder, by which God preaches to us; if you have a mind to climb from earth to heaven, you mu&s;t get up by the Son of God; no one ever pointed out a proper way to heaven for us but him&s;elf.
<PB N="328" REF="033217_0335_0FF69189A3758F78">
When Adam and Eve fell from God, a flam|ing &s;word turned every way to keep them from the tree of life; but Je&s;us alone is a new and living way, not only to the Holy of Holies below, but into the immediate pre&s;ence of God; and that we might know that he was a proper Saviour, the top of it reached to hea|ven; if it had &s;topped &s;hort Jacob might have &s;aid, ah! the ladder is within a little way of heaven, but does not quite reach it; if I climb up to the top I &s;hall not get there after all; but the top reached to heaven, to point out the divinity and exaltation of the Son of God; &s;uch a Saviour became us who was God, God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for evermore: and therefore the Arian &s;cheme is mo&s;t uncom|fortable and de&s;tructive; to talk of Chri&s;t as a Saviour that is not God, is no Chri&s;t at all. I would turn Dei&s;t to-morrow if I did not know that Chri&s;t was God; <HI>but cur&s;ed is the man that build, his faith upon an arm of fle&s;h.</HI> If Chri&s;t is God, the Arians and Socinians, by their own principles, are undone for ever; but Je&s;us Chri&s;t is very God, and very man, begotten (and not made) of the Father: God, of his infinite mercy, write his divinity deep in our hearts!</P>
<P>The bottom of the ladder reached to the earth; this points out to us the humiliation of the ble&s;&s;ed Lord: for us men he came down from heaven; we pray to and for a de&s;cending God. All the &s;ufferings which our Lord vol|untarily expo&s;ed him&s;elf to, were that he
<PB N="329" REF="033217_0336_0FF6918BC5C64198">
might become a ladder for you and I to climb up to heaven by. Come down from the cro&s;s, &s;ay they, and we will believe thee; if he had, what would have become of us? did they believe on him when he was dead, buried, and ri&s;en again? no. Some people &s;ay, if Chri&s;t was here, O dear we &s;hould love him; ju&s;t as much as they did when he came down before. If he had come down from the cro&s;s, they would have hung him up again: O that you and I might make his cro&s;s a &s;tep to glory!</P>
<P>As the top of the ladder pointed out his ex|altation, the bottom his humiliation, the two &s;ides of the ladder being joined together, point out the union of the Deity and manhood in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t; and that as this ladder had &s;teps to it, &s;o ble&s;&s;ed be God, Je&s;us Chri&s;t has found out a way whereby we may go, &s;tep after &s;tep, to glory. The fir&s;t &s;tep is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, the active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience of the Redeemer; no &s;etting one foot upon this ladder without coming out of our&s;elves, and relying wholly upon a better righteou&s;ne&s;s than our own. Again, all the other &s;teps are the graces of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; therefore, you need not be afraid of our de|&s;troying inward holine&s;s, by preaching the doctrine of the imputation of Chri&s;t's righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, that one is the foundation, the other the &s;uper&s;tructure; to talk of my having the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to my &s;oul, without my having the holine&s;s of Chri&s;t im|parted to it, and bringing forth the fruits of
<PB N="330" REF="033217_0337_0FF6918DDAC180A8">
the Spirit as an evidence of it, is only deceiving our&s;elves. I would never preach upon im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s, without &s;peaking of in|ward holine&s;s, for if you don't take a great deal of care, you will unawares, under a pretence of exalting Chri&s;t, run into Antinomiani&s;m, depths that Calvin never went into; probably, you will imbitter others Spirits that don't agree with you, and at the &s;ame time hurt the fruits of the Spirit: may God give you clear heads, and at the &s;ame time warm hearts.</P>
<P>On the ladder Jacob &s;aw the angels of God a&s;cending and de&s;cending; what is that for? to &s;how that they are mini&s;tring &s;pirits, &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter to them that &s;hall be heirs of &s;alvation; therefore we find them attending upon Chri&s;t. We do not hear much of them after the canon of &s;cripture was clo&s;ed, but as &s;oon as ever Chri&s;t was born, the angels &s;ang, till then we never hear of their &s;inging below, as far as I can judge, &s;ince the creation; then the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy; but when Eve reached out her hand to pluck the fatal apple, and gave to Adam, earth groaned, and the angels hung, as it were, their harps upon the willows; but when Chri&s;t, the &s;econd Adam, was born, the angels &s;ang at midnight, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t.</HI> I pray to God we may all die &s;inging that anthem, and &s;ing it to all eternity. After his temptations, they came and mini&s;tred to him, as &s;ome think, food for his body, and wi&s;hed him joy and comfort in his &s;oul; and in his agonies in the

garden, an angel &s;trengthned him. After his re&s;urrection two appeared again, one at the head and another at the foot of his &s;epulchre, to let tho&s;e that looked into the &s;epulchre know, that they would not only wait upon the head but the foot; and the angels are glad to wait upon the meane&s;t of the children of God. When our Lord departed, a cloud received him out of their &s;ight, which probably was a cloud of angels: having led his di&s;ciples out of the city, he ble&s;&s;ed them, and then away he went to heaven: may that ble&s;&s;ing re&s;t upon you and your children! This intimates that God makes u&s;e of angels to attend his people, e&s;pecially when they are departing in|to eternity: perhaps, part of our entertain|ment in heaven will be, to hear the angels declare how many millions of times they have a&s;&s;i&s;ted and helped us. Our Lord &s;ays, an|gels do there behold the face of the Father of his little ones; and therefore I love to talk to the lambs of the flock, and why &s;hould I not talk to them whom angels think it their honor to guard; and if it was not for this, how would any children e&s;cape the dangers they are expo&s;ed to in their tender age? it is owing to the particular providence of God, that any one child is brought to manhood; therefore I can't help admiring that part of the Litany, in which we pray, that God would take care not only of the grown people, but of children al&s;o: God take care of yours both in body and &s;oul.</P>

But what gave the greate&s;t comfort to Ja|cob was, that the Lord was on the top of the ladder, which I do not know whether it would have been &s;o, if Jacob had not &s;een God there. It comforts me, I a&s;&s;ure you, to think, that whenever God &s;hall call for me, I &s;hall be carried by angels into Abraham's bo&s;om; and I have often thought that whenever that time comes, that ble&s;&s;ed, long longed-for mo|ment comes, as &s;oon as ever they have called upon me, my fir&s;t que&s;tion will be to them, where is my dear ma&s;ter? where is Je&s;us? where is that dear Emanuel, who has loved me with an everla&s;ting love, and has called me by his grace, and have &s;ent you to fetch me home to &s;ee his face? but I believe you and I &s;hall have no occa&s;ion to a&s;k where he is, for he will come to meet us, he will &s;tand at the top of his ladder to take his pilgrims in; &s;o God was at the top of the ladder, pray mind that. He appears not &s;itting, as he is often repre&s;ented in heaven, but &s;tanding; as much as to &s;ay, here, here, Jacob, thy brother wants to kill thee; here thou art come out without a &s;ervant, art lying upon a hard bed, but here I am ready in order to pre&s;erve thee; I &s;tand above, and I &s;ee thy wearine&s;s, I &s;ee the fatigue and hard&s;hips thou ha&s;t yet to un|dergo, though thou do&s;t not &s;ee it thy&s;elf; thou ha&s;t thrown thy&s;elf upon my providence and protection, and I will give thee the word of a God that I will &s;tand by thee; <HI>the Lord &s;tood above:</HI> if he had &s;aid nothing, that would

Lay in a good &s;tock for your children, get a good many prayers in for them, they may be an&s;wered when you are dead and gone. <HI>I am the God of Abraham thy father,</HI> not thy grand|father; to put him in mind what an honor God would put upon him, to make him as it were the father of the church.

Now, &s;ays God, poor Ja|cob, thou do&s;t little think that this very &s;pot of ground that thou lie&s;t on to-night, cold and &s;tiff, I intend to give to thee, and thy po&s;teri|ty, for an inheritance. O my brethren, live all to God, and God will give all to you: who would have thought of this, probably Ja|cob did not: it is as if God took a plea&s;ure in &s;eeing his dear children lie on &s;uch hard ground; if he had been on a feather-bed, he might not have had &s;uch a vi&s;it: thou &s;halt have now a God to lean upon, <HI>to thee will I give it, and to thy &s;eed, which &s;hall be as the du&s;t of the earth, and thou &s;halt &s;pread abroad to the we&s;t, and to the ea&s;t, and to the north, and to the &s;outh: and in thee, and in thy &s;eed, &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Thus did heaven balance the lo&s;s of the comforts of his father's hou&s;e, by the di&s;covery of his and his offspring's pro&s;perity, by an intere&s;t in the promi&s;ed &s;eed.</P>

O remem|ber that my la&s;t words were, come, come to Chri&s;t; the Lord help you to come to Chri&s;t; come to Chri&s;t, come to Jacob's God; God give you faith like Jacob's faith.</P>
<P>You that have been kind to me, that have helped me when I was &s;ick, &s;ome of whom are here that have been very kind to me; may God reward you, my friends, and God forgive my enemies; God, of his infinite mercy, ble&s;s you all; you will be amply pro|vided for, I believe, here: may God &s;pread the go&s;pel every where; and may God never leave you, nor for&s;ake you. Even &s;o, Lord Je&s;us. Amen and Amen.</P>

<Q><HI>My &s;heep hear my voice, and I know them; and they follow me. And I give unto them eter|nal life, and they &s;hall never peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand.</HI></Q>

<P>IT is a common, and, I believe, generally &s;peaking, my dear hearers, a true &s;aying, that bad manners beget good laws. Whether this will hold good in every particular, in re|&s;pect to the affairs of this world, I am per&s;uad|ed the ob&s;ervation is very pertinent in re&s;pect to the things of another; I mean bad man|ners, bad treatment, bad words, have been over-ruled by the &s;overeign grace of God, to produce and to be the cau&s;e of the be&s;t &s;er|mons that were ever delivered from the mouth of the God-man, Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>

One would have imagined, that as he came cloathed with divine efficience, as he came with divine credentials, as he &s;pake as never man &s;pake, that no one &s;hould have been able to have re&s;i&s;ted the wi&s;dom with which he &s;pake; one would imagine they &s;hould have been &s;o &s;truck with the demon&s;tration of the Spirit, that with one con&s;ent they &s;hould all own, that he was <HI>that prophet that was to be rai&s;ed up like unto Mo&s;es.</HI> But you &s;eldom find our Lord preaching a &s;ermon, but &s;omething or other that he &s;aid was cavilled at; nay, their enmity frequently broke through all good manners; they often, therefore, interrupted him whil&s;t he was preaching, which &s;hows the enmity of their hearts long before God per|mitted it to be in their power to &s;hed his in|nocent blood. If we look no farther than this chapter, where he repre&s;ents him&s;elf as a good &s;hepherd, one that laid down his life for his &s;heep; we &s;ee the be&s;t return he had, was to be looked upon as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or di&s;tracted; for we are told that there was a divi&s;ion there|fore again among the Jews for the&s;e &s;ayings, and many of them &s;aid, <HI>he hath a devil and is mad, why hear ye him?</HI> If the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was &s;erved &s;o, pray what are the &s;er|vants to expect? Others, a little more &s;ober-minded, &s;aid, <HI>the&s;e are not the words of him that hath a devil;</HI> the devil never u&s;ed to preach or act in this way. <HI>Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</HI> So he had &s;ome friends among the&s;e rabble.

Lord, he goes on in his work; and we &s;hall never, never go on with the work of God, till, like our ma&s;ter, we are willing to go through good and through evil report: and let the devil &s;ee we are not &s;o complai&s;ant as to &s;top one moment for his barking at us as we go along.</P>
<P>We are told, that our Lord was at Jeru&s;a|lem at the fea&s;t of the dedication, and it was winter; the fea&s;t of dedication held, I think, &s;even or eight days for the commemoration of the re&s;toration of the Temple and Altar after its profanation by Antiochus: now this was certainly a mere human in&s;titution, and had no divine image, had no divine &s;uper&s;cription upon it; and yet I don't find that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter preached again&s;t it; I don't find that he &s;pent his time about this; his heart was too big with &s;uperior things; and I believe when we, like him, are filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, we &s;hall not entertain our audiences with di&s;putes about rites and cere|monies, but &s;hall treat upon the e&s;&s;entials of the go&s;pel, and then rites and ceremonies will appear with more indifference. Our Lord does not &s;ay, that he would not go up to the fea&s;t, for, on the contrary, he did go there, not &s;o much to keep the fea&s;t, as to have an op|portunity to &s;pread the go&s;pel-net, and that &s;hould be our method not to follow di&s;puting; and it is the glory of the Methodi&s;ts, that we have been now forty years, and, I thank God, there has not been one &s;ingle pamphlet wrote
<PB N="348" REF="033217_0355_0FF691B9DC107E78">
by any of our preachers about the non-e&s;&s;en|tials of religion.</P>
<P>Our Lord always made the be&s;t of every opportunity; and we are told, <HI>he walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</HI> One would have thought the Scribes and Phari&s;ees would have put him in one of their &s;talls, and have complimented him with de&s;iring him to preach, no, they let him walk in Solomon's porch; &s;ome think he walked by him&s;elf, nobody choo&s;ing to keep company with him. Me|thinks, I &s;ee him walking and looking at the temple, and fore&s;eeing within him&s;elf how &s;oon it would be de&s;troyed; he walked pen|&s;ive, to &s;ee the dreadful calamities that would come upon the land, for not knowing the day of its vi&s;itation; and it was to let the world &s;ee he was not afraid to appear in public: he walked, as much as to &s;ay, have any of you any thing to &s;ay to me? and he put him&s;elf in their way, that if they had any thing to a&s;k him, he was ready to re&s;olve them; and to &s;hew them, that though they had treated him &s;o ill, yet he was ready to preach &s;alva|tion to them.</P>
<P>In the twenty-fourth ver&s;e we are told, <HI>Then came the Jews round about him, and &s;aid unto him, how long do&s;t thou make us to doubt?</HI> They came round about him when they &s;aw him walking in Solomon's porch; now, &s;ay they, we will have him, now we will attack him. And now was fulfilled that pa&s;&s;age in the P&s;alms, <HI>they compa&s;&s;ed me about like bees</HI> to

&s;ting me, or rather like wa&s;ps. Now, &s;ay they, we will get him in the middle of us, and &s;ee what &s;ort of a man he is; we will &s;ee whether we can't conquer him; they came to him and they &s;ay, <HI>how long do&s;t thou make us to doubt?</HI> Now this &s;eems a plau&s;ible que&s;|tion, <HI>how long do&s;t thou make us to doubt?</HI> Pray how long, &s;ir, do you intend to keep us in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e? Some think the words will bear this interpretation; pray, &s;ir, how long do you intend thus to &s;teal away our hearts? they would repre&s;ent him to be a de&s;igning man, like Ab&s;alom, to get the people on his &s;ide, and then &s;et up him&s;elf for the Me&s;&s;iah; thus carnal minds always interpret good mens ac|tions. But the meaning &s;eems to be this, they were doubting concerning Chri&s;t; doubt|ing Chri&s;tians may think it is God's fault that they doubt, but God knows it is all their own. <HI>How long do&s;t thou make us to doubt?</HI> I wi&s;h you would &s;peak a little plainer, &s;ir, and not let us have any more of your parables; pray let us know who you are, let us have it from your own mouth; <HI>if thou be the Chri&s;t tell us plainly;</HI> and I don't doubt but they put on a very &s;anctified face and looked very de|mure; <HI>if thou be the Chri&s;t tell us plainly,</HI> in|tending to catch him: if he does not &s;ay he is the Chri&s;t, we will &s;ay be is a&s;hamed of his own cau&s;e; if he does tell us plainly that he is the Chri&s;t, then we will impeach him to the governor, we will go and tell the govern|or that this man &s;ays he is the Me&s;&s;iah; now

we know of no Me&s;&s;iah but what is to jo&s;tle Cae&s;ar out of his throne. The devil always wants to make it believed that God's people, who are the mo&s;t loyal people in the world, are rebels to the government under which they live; <HI>if thou be the Chri&s;t tell us plainly.</HI> Our Lord does not let them wait long for an an&s;wer; hone&s;ty can &s;oon &s;peak: <HI>I told you and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they hear witne&s;s of me.</HI> Had our Lord &s;aid, I am the Me&s;&s;iah, they would have taken him up; he knew that, and there|fore he joined <HI>the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent</HI> with <HI>the innocence of the dove:</HI> &s;ays he, I appeal to my works and doctrine, and if you will not infer from them that I am the Me&s;&s;iah, I have no further argument. <HI>But,</HI> he adds, <HI>ye believe not, becau&s;e ye are not of my &s;heep.</HI> He complains twice; for their unbelief was the greate&s;t grief of heart to Chri&s;t: then he goes on in the words of our text, <HI>My &s;heep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give unto them eternal life, and they &s;hall never peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand.</HI> My &s;heep hear my voice; you think to puzzle me, you think to chagrin me with this kind of conduct, but you are mi&s;|taken; you don't believe on me, becau&s;e you are not of my &s;heep. The great Mr. Stodart, of New-England, (and no place under heaven produces greater divines than New England) preached once from the&s;e words, <HI>but ye believe not, becau&s;e ye are not of my &s;heep;</HI> a very
<PB N="351" REF="033217_0358_0FF691C0808ADAE0">
&s;trange text to preach upon to convince a con|gregation, yet God &s;o ble&s;&s;ed it, that two or three hundred &s;ouls were awakened by that &s;ermon: God grant &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s to attend the labours of all his faithful mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>My &s;heep hear my voice and they follow me.</HI> It is very remarkable, there are but two &s;orts of people mentioned in &s;cripture; it does not &s;ay the Bapti&s;ts and Independents, nor the Methodi&s;ts and Pre&s;byterians; no, Je&s;us Chri&s;t divides the whole world into but two cla&s;&s;es, &s;heep and goats: the Lord give us to &s;ee this morning to which of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es we belong.</P>
<P>But it is ob&s;ervable, believers are always compared to &s;omething that is good and pro|fitable, and unbelievers are always de&s;cribed by &s;omething that is bad, and good for little or nothing.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k me why Chri&s;t's people are cal|led &s;heep? as God &s;hall enable me I will give you a &s;hort, and I hope it will be to you an an&s;wer of peace. Sheep, you know, generally love to be together; we &s;ay a flock of &s;heep, we don't &s;ay a herd of &s;heep; &s;heep are little creatures, and Chri&s;t's people may be called &s;heep, becau&s;e they are little in the eyes of the world, and they are yet le&s;s in their own eyes. O &s;ome people think if the great men were on our &s;ide, if we had king, lords, and commons on our &s;ide, I mean if they were all true believers, O if we had all the kings upon the earth on our &s;ide, &s;uppo&s;e you had; alas! alas! do you think the church would go on

the better? why, if it was fa&s;hionable to be a Methodi&s;t at court, if it was fa&s;hionable to be a methodi&s;t abroad, they would go with a bible or a hymn-book in&s;tead of a novel; but religion never thrives under too much &s;un|&s;hine. <HI>Not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath cho&s;en the fooli&s;h things of the world to confound the wi&s;e, and God hath cho&s;en the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.</HI> Dr. Watts &s;ays, here and there I &s;ee a king, and here and there a great man in heaven, but their number is but &s;mall.</P>
<P>Sheep are looked upon to be the mo&s;t harm|le&s;s, quiet creatures that God hath made: O may God, of his infinite mercy, give us to know that we are his &s;heep, by our having this ble&s;&s;ed temper infu&s;ed into our hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t. <HI>Learn of me,</HI> &s;aith our ble&s;&s;ed Lord; what to do, to work miracles? no; <HI>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</HI> A very good man, now living, &s;aid once, if there is any one particular temper I de&s;ire more than another, it is the grace of <HI>meekne&s;s,</HI> quietly to bear bad treatment, to forget and to forgive; and at the &s;ame time that I am &s;en|&s;ible I am injured, not to be overcome of evil, but to have grace given me to overcome evil with good. To the honour of Mo&s;es it is declared, that he was the meeke&s;t man upon earth. Meekne&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary for people in power; a man that is pa&s;&s;ionate is dangerous; every governor &s;hould have a warm temper, but a man of an unrelenting, unforgiving

temper, is no more fit for government than Phaeton to drive the chariot of the &s;un, he only &s;ets the world on fire.</P>
<P>You all know, that &s;heep of all creatures in the world are the mo&s;t apt to &s;tray and be lo&s;t; Chri&s;t's people may ju&s;tly, in that re|&s;pect, be compared to &s;heep; therefore, in the introduction to our morning &s;ervice, we &s;ay, <HI>We have erred and &s;trayed from thy ways like lo&s;t &s;heep.</HI> Turn out a hor&s;e, or a dog, and they will find their way home, but a &s;heep wanders about, he bleats here and there, as much as to &s;ay, dear &s;tranger, &s;hew me my home again: thus Chri&s;t's &s;heep are too apt to wander from the fold; having their eye off the great &s;hepherd, they go into this field, and that field, over this hedge and that, and often return home with the lo&s;s of their wool.</P>
<P>But at the &s;ame time &s;heep are the mo&s;t u&s;eful creatures in the world; they manure the land, and thereby prepare it for the &s;eed; they clothe our bodies with wool, and there is not the lea&s;t part of a &s;heep but is u&s;eful to man: O my brethren, God grant that you and I may, in this re&s;pect, an&s;wer the charac|ter of &s;heep.

It was a maxim in the fir&s;t reformers time, that though the <HI>Arminians</HI> preached up good works, you mu&s;t go to the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> for them. Chri&s;t's &s;heep &s;tudy to

It was a hard bargain, but Chri&s;t was willing to &s;trike the bargain, that you and I might not be damned for ever.</P>

<P>The con&s;equence of hearing his voice, and the proof that we do hear his voice, will be to follow him.

We accu&s;e one another, we turn devils to one another are accu&s;ers of the brethren, and what will &s;upport two of God's people when judged by one another but this, Lord, thou knowe&s;t my integrity, thou knowe&s;t how matters are with me?</P>
<P>But, my brethren, here is &s;omething bet|ter, here is good news for you; what is that? fly you; why, <HI>I give unto them eternal life, and they &s;hall never peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand.</HI> O that the words may come to your hearts with as much warmth and power as they did to mine thirty-five years ago. I never prayed again&s;t any corruption I had in my life, &s;o much as I did again&s;t going into holy orders, &s;o &s;oon as my friends were for having me go; and bi&s;hop Ben&s;on was plea&s;ed to honor me with peculiar friend&s;hip, &s;o as to offer me preferment, or do any thing for me: my friends wanted me to mount the church betimes, they wanted me to knock my head again&s;t the pulpit too young; but how &s;ome young men &s;tand up here and there and preach, I don't know how it may be to them; but God knows how deep a concern entering into the mini&s;try and preaching was
<PB N="360" REF="033217_0367_0FF691D5DC728C08">
to me: I have prayed a thou&s;and times till the &s;weat has dropped from my face like rain, that God of his infinite mercy, would not let me enter the church before he called me to, and thru&s;t me forth in his work. I remember once in Glouce&s;ter, I know the room, I look up at the window when I am there and walk along the &s;treet; I know the window, the bed&s;ide, and the floor upon which I have laid pro&s;trate: I &s;aid, Lord, I cannot go, I &s;hall be puffed up with pride, and fall into the condemnation of the devil; Lord, don't let me go yet; I pleaded to be at Oxford two or three years more; I intended to make an hun|dred and fifty &s;ermons, and thought I would &s;et up with a good &s;tock in trade however; but I remember praying, wre&s;tling, and &s;triv|ing with God; I &s;aid, I am undone, I am unfit to preach in thy great name, &s;end me not, pray, Lord, &s;end me not yet. I wrote to all my friends in town and country, to pray again&s;t the bi&s;hop's &s;olicitation, but they in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould go into orders before I was twenty-two. After all their &s;olicitation the&s;e words came into my mind, <HI>nothing &s;hall pluck you out of my hand.</HI> O may the words be ble&s;|&s;ed to you, my dear friends, that I am parting with, as they were to me when they came warm upon my heart; then, and not till then, I &s;aid, Lord, I will go, &s;end me when thou wilt. I remember when I was in a place called Dover-I&s;land, near Georgia, we put in with bad winds; I had an hundred and fifty
<PB N="361" REF="033217_0368_0FF691D8292543A0">
in family to maintain, and not a &s;ingle farth|ing to do it with, in the deare&s;t part of the king's dominions; I remember, I told a min|i&s;ter of Chri&s;t now in heaven I had the&s;e words once, &s;ir, <HI>Nothing &s;hall pluck you out of my hand.</HI> O, &s;ays he, take comfort from them, you may be &s;ure God will be as good as his word, if he never tells you &s;o again. And our Lord knew his poor &s;heep would be always doubt|ing they &s;hould never reach heaven, therefore, &s;ays he, <HI>I give to them eternal life, and they &s;hall never peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Here are in our text three ble&s;&s;ed declara|tions, or promi&s;es:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. <HI>I know them.</HI></P>
<P>Second. <HI>They &s;hall never peri&s;h:</HI> though they often think they &s;hall peri&s;h by the hand of their lu&s;ts and corruptions; they think they &s;hall peri&s;h by the deceitfulne&s;s of their hearts; but Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>they &s;hall never peri&s;h.</HI> I have brought them out of the world to my|&s;elf, and do you think I will let them go to hell after that. <HI>I give to them eternal life;</HI> pray mind that; not I will, but I do. Some talk of being ju&s;tified at the day of judgment, that is non&s;en&s;e; if we are not ju&s;tified here, we &s;hall not be ju&s;tified there. He gives them eternal life, that is, the earne&s;t, the pledge, and a&s;&s;urance of it; the indwelling of the Spirit of God here, is the earne&s;t of glory hereafter.</P>
<P>Third. <HI>Neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand.</HI> He holds them in his hand, that is, he holds them by his power, none &s;hall pluck
<PB N="362" REF="033217_0369_0FF691D9E452A908">
them thence; there is always &s;omething pluck|ing at Chri&s;t's &s;heep, the devil, the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;ts of the eye, and the pride of life, all try to pluck them out of Chri&s;t's hand. O my brethren, they need not pluck us, for we help all three to pluck our&s;elves out of the hand of Je&s;us; but <HI>none &s;hall pluck them out of my hand,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t. <HI>I give to them eternal life. I am going to heaven to pre|pare a place for them, and there they &s;hall be.</HI> O my brethren, if it was not for keeping you too long, and too much exhau&s;ting my own &s;pirits, I could call upon you to leap for joy; there is not a more ble&s;&s;ed text to &s;upport the final per&s;everance of the &s;aints; and I am a&s;toni&s;hed any poor &s;oul, and good people I hope too, can fight again&s;t the doctrine of the per&s;everance of the &s;aints; what if a per&s;on &s;ay they &s;hould per&s;evere in wickedne&s;s? ah! that is an abu&s;e of the doctrine; what, be|cau&s;e &s;ome people &s;poil good food, are we nev|er to eat it? But, my brethren, upon this text I can leave my cares, all my friends, and all Chri&s;t's &s;heep to the protection of Chri&s;t Je&s;us's never-failing love.</P>
<P>I thought this morning, when I came here riding from the other end of the town, it was to me like coming to be executed publicly; and when the carriage turned ju&s;t at the end of the walk, and I &s;aw you running here, O thinks I it is like a per&s;on now coming ju&s;t to the place where he is to be executed: when I went up to put on my gown, I thought it
<PB N="363" REF="033217_0370_0FF691DC3483EC88">
was ju&s;t like dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to be made a pub|lic &s;pectable to &s;hed my blood for Chri&s;t; and I take all heaven and earth to witne&s;s, and God and the holy angels to witne&s;s, that though I had preferment enough offered me, that though the bi&s;hop took me in his arms, and offered me two pari&s;hes when I was but twenty-two years old, and always took me to his table; though I had preferment enough offered me when I was ordained, thou, O God, knowe&s;t, that when the bi&s;hop put his hand upon my head, I looked for no other preferment than publicly to &s;uffer for the Lamb of God: in this &s;pirit I came out, in this &s;pirit I came up to this metropolis. I was thinking when I read of Jacob's going over the brook with a &s;taff, that I would not &s;ay &s;o much, but I came up without a friend, I went to Oxford without a friend, I had not a &s;ervant, I had not any one to introduce me; but God, by his Holy Spirit, was plea&s;ed to rai&s;e me up to preach for his great name's &s;ake: through his Divine Spirit I continue to this day, and fell my affections are as &s;trong as ever towards the work, and the people of the living God. The congregations at both ends of the town are dear to me: God has honored me to build this and the other place; and, ble&s;&s;ed be his name, as he called me to Georgia at fir&s;t, and I left all London affairs to God's care, when I had mo&s;t of the church|es in London open for me, and had twelve or
<PB N="364" REF="033217_0371_0FF691DEC0481CF0">
fourteen con&s;tables to keep the doors, that people might not croud too much; I had of|fers of hundreds then to &s;ettle in London, yet I gave it up for God, to go into a foreign clime; and I hope with that &s;ame &s;ingle in|tention I am going now.</P>
<P>When I came from America la&s;t, I thought I had no other river to pa&s;s over but the river Jordan, I remember I told you &s;o; and as the orphan-hou&s;e was then to be given, I thought, out of my hands, I then intended to retire into &s;ome little corner, and pray when I could not preach, my &s;pitits were &s;o low, and my nerves and animal frame &s;o weak, but God, of his infinite mercy, has renewed my &s;trength, and is plea&s;ed to rai&s;e my &s;pirits, &s;o that I find my heart is willing to go here or there, wher|ever God &s;hall call.</P>
<P>The orphan-hou&s;e being turned into a col|lege is a matter of great con&s;equence; you that have not been in America can't tell, but I heartily wi&s;h, I am neither a prophet, nor the &s;on of a prophet, and I hope none of us will ever be driven to America for an a&s;ylum, where God's people were driven from this land and hundred years ago: clouds are grow|ing thick, and if a &s;pirit of moderation does not prevail among governors and governed, what but confu&s;ion mu&s;t happen to per&s;ons who &s;trive one with another, and are making &s;port for the devil by de&s;troying one another? may the great and gracious God avert every
<PB N="365" REF="033217_0372_0FF691E0E8AF4498">
impending &s;torm; and by diffu&s;ing a &s;pirit of moderation and of a &s;ound mind, and by keeping his people clo&s;e to him&s;elf, avert tho&s;e &s;torms, tho&s;e terrible, judgments, that we have rea&s;on to expect from our repeated provocations. I am going now to &s;ettle the orphan hou&s;e upon a proper ba&s;is; I go now in the fall, that I may be in Georgia in the winter, which is fine weather there. The twenty-fifth of March is the anniver&s;ary of the day on which I laid the fir&s;t brick of the or|phan-hou&s;e; by that time, I hope, all the buildings will be fini&s;hed, and the plantation &s;ettled; and then I hope to go and preach along the continent to New-England, and from thence I intend, if God permit me, to return to my dear London and Engli&s;h friends again.</P>
<P>I have ble&s;&s;ed news from the orphan-hou&s;e; one writes to me word, Would to God you could &s;end a thou&s;and &s;uch as you have &s;ent, Mr. Dixon, and his wife, that have been old &s;ervants there; Mr. Wright, Mr. Crayne, and Mr. Wright's brother, and tho&s;e that have been employed with them to carry on the work of the Lord; and I cannot think but God intends to lay a foundation for a ble&s;&s;ed &s;eminary for Chri&s;t: Lord Je&s;us, hear our prayers upon that account.</P>
<P>Now I mu&s;t come to the harde&s;t part I have to act: I was afraid when I came out from home, that I could not bear the &s;hock,
<PB N="366" REF="033217_0373_0FF691E3042D9480">
but I hope the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will help me to bear it, and help you to give me up to the ble&s;&s;ed God, let him do with me what he will. This is the thirteenth time of my cro&s;&s;ing the mighty waters; it is a little difficult at this time of life; and though my &s;pirits are im|proved in &s;ome degree, yet weakne&s;s is the be&s;t of my &s;trength: but I delight in the cau&s;e, and God fills me with a peace that is unutterable, which nobody knows, and a &s;tranger intermeddles not with: into his hands I commend my &s;pirit; and I beg that this may be the language of your hearts, Lord, keep him, let nothing pluck him out of thy hands. I expect many a trial while I am on board, &s;atan always meets me there; but that God which has kept me, I believe will keep me. I thank God, I have the honor of leav|ing every thing quite well and ea&s;y at both ends of the town; and, my dear hearers, my prayers to God &s;hall be, that nothing may pluck you out of Chri&s;t's hands. Witne&s;s again&s;t me, if I ever &s;et up a party for my&s;elf; did ever any mini&s;ter, or could any mini&s;ter in the world &s;ay, that I ever &s;poke again&s;t any one going to any dear mini&s;ter? I thank God, that he has enabled me to be always &s;trengthning the hands of all, though &s;ome have afterwards been a&s;hamed to own me. I declare to you, that I believe that God will be with me, and will &s;trengthen me; and I believe it is in an&s;wer to your prayers, that
<PB N="367" REF="033217_0374_0FF691E61B358F98">
God is plea&s;ed to revive my &s;pirits: may the Lord help you to pray on. If I am drown|ed in the waves I will &s;ay, Lord, take care of my London, take care of my Engli&s;h friends, let nothing pluck them out of thy hands.</P>
<P>And as Chri&s;t has given us eternal life, O my brethren, &s;ome of you, I doubt not, will be gone to him before my return; but, my dear brethren, my dear hearers, never mind that; we &s;hall part, but it will be to meet again forever. I dare not meet you now, I can't bear your coming to me to part from me, it cuts me to the heart and quite over|comes me, but by and by all parting will be over, and all tears &s;hall be wiped away from our eyes. God grant that none that weep now at my parting, may weep at our meeting at the day of judgment; and if you never were among Chri&s;t's &s;heep before, may Chri&s;t Je&s;us bring you now. O come, come, &s;ee what it is to have eternal life; don't refu&s;e it; ha&s;te, &s;inner, ha&s;te away: may the great, the good &s;hepherd, draw your &s;ouls. Oh! if you nev|er heard his voice before, God grant you may hear it now; that I may have this comfort when I am gone that I had la&s;t, that &s;ome &s;ouls are awakened at the parting &s;ermon. O that it may be a farewel &s;ermon to you; that it may be a means of your taking a fare|wel of the world, the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;ts of the eye, and the pride of life. O come, come, come, to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to him I leave you.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="033217_0375_0FF691E831629FB8">
And you, dear &s;heep, that are already in his hands, O may God keep you from wand|ering; God keep you near Chri&s;t's feet; I don't care what &s;hepherds keep you, &s;o as you are kept near the great &s;hepherd and bi&s;hop of &s;ouls. The Lord God keep you, lift up the light of his countenance upon you, and give you peace. Amen.</P>
