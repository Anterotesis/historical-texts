<P>APPLICATION having been made to me, by the young men of this Society who are engaged in the pre&s;ent War, for the term of three years, that I &s;hould on this morning addre&s;s them in publick (they expecting to &s;et off in the afternoon for camp) In compliance with their re|que&s;t, I &s;hall attempt to &s;ugge&s;t a few things to their con&s;ideration and improvement, which however im|perfectly treated, will be well aimed, even for their profiting.</P>
<P>The words cho&s;en, when ju&s;tly attended to, and con&s;idered, may be judged, as containing things &s;uita|ble not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for gentlemen of a military character,

but forevery denomination of men, con&s;idered as chri&s;|tians. Their primary u&s;e and immediate direction, it &s;eems, were to the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, particu|larly to Timothy. St. Paul directs, or rather gives in charge to him thus, "Thou therefore my &s;on, be &s;trong in the grace which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and the things that thou ha&s;t heard of me, among many witne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame commit thou to faithful men, who &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o." And then &s;olemnly charges him&punc; thus, as in the ver&s;e imme|diately preceeding the text, "Thou therefore endure hardne&s;s, as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." And this he illu&s;trates by introducing and pointing out the duty of a faithful &s;oldier, who, having harna&s;&s;ed him&s;elf goeth &s;orth to war: No &s;uch man entangleth him&s;elf with the affairs of this life, that he may plea&s;e him who hath cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier, that is, no man, who undertaketh and is faithful in the cau&s;e of his country, entangleth him&s;elf with the affairs of this life; &s;uch a &s;oldier leaves the affairs and bu&s;ine&s;s that he was formerly occupied in, and gives up, and devotes him&s;elf to the duties that belong to his character as a &s;oldier, that he may plea&s;e his com|mander, and an&s;wer the ju&s;t expectation of his em|ployers for the country's defence: And thus St. Paul would have Timothy be faithful, as a good chri&s;|tian &s;oldier to his divine Commander, even Je&s;us the captain of our &s;alvation, would, from the weightie&s;t rea&s;ons, have him exert him&s;elf in the be&s;t manner, to promote the good de&s;igned by the go&s;pel mini|&s;try, and therefore would not have him entangle him&s;elf with the affairs of this life, would not have him plunge him&s;elf into the bu&s;y and perplexing

concernments of this life and world, lea&s;t the duties of his office as a mini&s;ter, and character as a chri&s;tian, &s;hould not be di&s;charged.</P>
<P>His ma&s;ter Chri&s;t, who had cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier, to oppo&s;e his enemies and the enemies of his kingdom, and into who&s;e &s;ervice he had engaged, expected he would approve him&s;elf faithful, and in this way plea&s;e him; that he would be &s;tudious and ready at all times to plea&s;e him by his fidelity, as the good &s;oldier in the field is to plea&s;e his com|mander whom he loves and fears.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the primary u&s;e and direc|tion of the&s;e words were to Timothy and other mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, they may be applied to com|mon chri&s;tians; they may in &s;ome &s;ort be applied to us all, whether mini&s;ters, common chri&s;tians or &s;ol|diers, and teach us the duties we owe to Chri&s;t our divine Commander.</P>
<P>For let our &s;tation and occupation in life, be what it may, we ought to think our&s;elves as indi&s;|pen&s;ibly bound to war a good warfare, to quit our|&s;elves like men, and with the go&s;pel armour oppo&s;e our &s;piritual, which are our mo&s;t dangerous foes. The direction of the Apo&s;tle is this, 1. Tim. i. 18, 19. &mdash;War a good warfare, holding faith and a good con&s;cience.</P>
<P>When men go forth to war again&s;t their common enemy, they are not to think they have no other duty to perform, but that of approving them&s;elves as obedient and faithful &s;oldiers to their re&s;pective

officers; but as chri&s;tians, to remember the duties they owe to their divine Commander, and to them|&s;elves; and &s;ee to it, they do not live in the neglect hereof. For this notion and opinion which hath been in&s;tilled into &s;ome of the military character, that if a man dies in battle, having there acquitted him&s;elf with honor in oppo&s;ing the enemy, he &s;hall be &s;aved, becau&s;e he dies in a good cau&s;e, let his character be as it may in other re&s;pects: I &s;ay, this opinion is to be exploded as not founded in truth.</P>
<P>A man may be a good &s;oldier in his country's cau&s;e, do his tour of duty and fight valiantly, when called to it, and yet not be a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; not war the chri&s;tian warfare, not oppo&s;e his &s;piritual enemies, but tamely &s;ubmit to the bon|dage of &s;in and &s;atan: And &s;urely if this mo&s;t im|portant warfare be not warred, how can men in the exerci&s;e of calm rea&s;on, expect to be &s;aved, altho' they may have been good &s;oldiers in other re&s;pects!</P>
<P>However, I mean not to &s;ay any thing to le&s;&s;en a &s;en&s;e of duty in re&s;pect to fidelity, acting as &s;oldiers in the defence of our country's liberties, but to urge it; and at the &s;ame time hold up to view the im|portance of acting as chri&s;tians, or, in other words, to endure hardne&s;s as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to oppo&s;e the enemies of his kingdom and our &s;pi|ritual foes, with all that care, precaution and vigilance which come into the account of &s;elf-defence and fidelity to Chri&s;t.&mdash;My principal aim in the &s;equel will be, to point out to the young men whom I am to addre&s;s in this di&s;cour&s;e, the duties they owe to
<PB N="9" REF="017438_0008_0FA11D61F1FD9B80">
Chri&s;t their divine commander, who may be &s;aid to have cho&s;en them to be &s;oldiers; but &s;hall fir&s;t touch upon their duty, con&s;idered as &s;oldiers in their country's cau&s;e. In this view, &s;hall point out the rea&s;on why they are not to entangle them&s;elves with the affairs of this life: For, no doubt, the Apo&s;tle&punc; in this illu&s;tration of the duty of Timothy in his calling, means to compare it to the duty which a &s;oldier in the field owes to his commander and to his country, and therefore of &s;uch an one &s;ays&punc; No man that warreth, that is, no man who &s;trives lawfully and faithfully, entangleth him&s;elf with the affairs of this life, that he may plea&s;e him who hath cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier.&mdash;If he entangleth him&s;elf with the&s;e things, he cannot acquit him&s;elf with honor and advantage.</P>
<P>A &s;oldier, who undertakes with a true de&s;ign to be faithful, entangleth, or embarra&s;&s;eth not him&s;elf with &s;uch things as are foreign from the department into which he hath voluntarily inli&s;ted him&s;elf. Such a &s;oldier leaves the affairs of this life; leaves his farm, his trade, and his merchandi&s;e, or what|ever kind of bu&s;ine&s;s he had before employed him|&s;elf in: he leaves his dear friends and connections, all his circle of agreeable acquaintance (except tho&s;e that accompany him in the &s;ame undertaking) yea, he leaves all his dome&s;tic concernments and parti|cular endearments, and &s;en&s;ible of his duty and the pre&s;&s;ing call of Providence, goes forth to do tho&s;e &s;ervices of the camp, and in the field, where|unto he is called, that he may plea&s;e him who hath cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="017438_0009_0FA11D6434573738">And here it may not be out of place, to con&s;ider who hath cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier. And will not this naturally occur, that his employers cho&s;e him, the people for whom he undertook? The&s;e con|fiding in him, as one who would be true and faith|ful, intrepid and valiant, ready to endure hardne&s;s and encounter danger for the good of the country, and for the protection, defence and &s;afety of his friends, his own and their property, which he leaves behind; the people, his employers, thus confiding in him, choo&s;e him to be a &s;oldier. Moreover, a &s;oldier of &s;uch tru&s;t and confidence, may be con|&s;idered as cho&s;en by the commander in chief and his re&s;pective officers. For, if they are of the &s;ame approved character, true and faithful&punc; intrepid and valiant, ready to endure hardne&s;s and encounter danger for the common good, they doubtle&s;s choo&s;e and welcome &s;uch a &s;oldier, and will manife&s;t their approbation of and attachment to him, not only by common tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect, but will aim to promote and honor him according to merit. The&s;e things being con&s;idered, the &s;oldier has &s;et before him no &s;mall motive to exert him&s;elf to plea&s;e him or them who have cho&s;en and welcomed him to be a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>But to return and &s;peak a little more to this, viz. He entangleth not him&s;elf with the affairs of this life, i. e. he engages not in, nor &s;pends his time about &s;uch things as enervate and di&s;qualify from performing the duties of his &s;tation. The good &s;oldier therefore mu&s;t be temperate, pure, cha&s;te, and not &s;pend his time in gaming, intemperance, lewdne&s;s and debauchery; le&s;t through the want of
<PB N="11" REF="017438_0010_0FA11D66078EEFC0">
virtue and fidelity, the great end of being cho&s;en a &s;oldier &s;hould be fru&s;trated, and the enemy get advantage, which has often been the ca&s;e, where &s;oldiers, unmindful of the duties of their character, have entangled them&s;elves with &s;uch kind of things. The evils and vices above mentioned may be rec|koned among the affairs of this life, which the good &s;oldier will be careful not to be encumbered with: And every man that &s;triveth for the ma&s;tery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible, 1. Cor. ix. 25. It is the plain duty of the &s;oldier, as he would approve him&s;elf faithful to him&s;elf and his country, to be temperate, brave and virtuous, being ready for every tour of duty and enterprize to which he is called by his commanding officer.</P>
<P>As a &s;oldier, his daily care mu&s;t be to acquit him|&s;elf for and to do the bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;tation from early to late, as it was indu&s;triou&s;ly to go through his labor and dome&s;tic concernments, before he a&s;&s;umed the character of a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>In the camp, it may be, that the occa&s;ions and circum&s;tances of an army do not call for that exer|tion, labour, fatigue and enterprize at &s;ome times which they may at others, yet in the mo&s;t lei&s;ure and uninterrupted &s;paces, the faithful &s;oldier is not to entangle him&s;elf with tho&s;e things that are pre|judical to his health, honor and &s;afety; but is ever &s;o to govern him&s;elf and pa&s;&s;ions as to be in a ready, ea&s;y and alert po&s;ture of defence and action, though &s;uddenly and in the u&s;ual hours of repo&s;e, called to it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="017438_0011_0FA11D6796BB2338">Moreover if the occa&s;ions and circum&s;tances of an army &s;hould at &s;ome particular periods, call for long and ince&s;&s;ant fatigue and hard&s;hip, the faithful &s;ol|dier is not to &s;hrink back or de&s;ert his colours. He is not to harbour a wi&s;h to return back to the affairs of this life, though his own ea&s;e, plea&s;ure and tem|poral emolument may prompt him.</P>
<P>The compleat character of a faithful &s;oldier, can|not be con&s;tituted &s;hort of his being willing to en|dure hardne&s;s, when the exigence of affairs make it nece&s;&s;ary. A cau&s;e &s;o great and important, as that of &s;ecuring the liberties and maintaining the lives and properties of a great and good country, as this is, is not to be de&s;erted becau&s;e &s;ome very hard, fatiguing and dangerous things are to be encountered. For con&s;ider, if &s;o great and good a cau&s;e be de|&s;erted, on whatever pretence, the con&s;equence, in all probability, would be va&s;tly more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and terrible, than to continue, bearing the greate&s;t ima|ginable fatigues and hard&s;hips, that &s;oldiers, engaged in &s;uch a glorious cau&s;e, are ever called to. It is not ea&s;y to figure to our&s;elves the deplorable &s;itua|tion in which this country would be involved, &s;hould the noble ardour in the cau&s;e of liberty, which hath pervaded every part, and catched in every generous brea&s;t, be now extingui&s;hed. The con&s;equence of relaxing and abating that zeal and prowe&s;s with which our fellow citizens and brave &s;oldiers have &s;o long oppo&s;ed our enemies and defended America. The con&s;equence (I &s;ay) of a relexation <HI>now,</HI> will be to let in our oppre&s;&s;ors like a flood upon us, and tamely &s;ubmit to conque&s;t. It is ea&s;y to conceive whether this is not a condition infinitely wor&s;e than to bear tho&s;e burdens and endure tho&s;e fatigues to which
<PB N="13" REF="017438_0012_0FA11D680A619BA8">
we are called during the conte&s;t. Alarmed with the&s;e con&s;equences, the good &s;oldier will carefully cheri&s;h that noble ardour, that love of liberty, love of his country, which has &s;upported us from the beginning of the conte&s;t to the pre&s;ent day, and with which every patriotic mind con&s;ents to endure hardne&s;s 'till it ends in our favour and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of our independence.</P>
<P>In a word, faithfulne&s;s and a &s;en&s;e of honor, together with this country's &s;afety and well being&punc; will prevail upon every good &s;oldier, to bear patiently tho&s;e intervals of hard&s;hip and to encounter tho&s;e particular in&s;tances of danger, to which his lot as a &s;oldier will at any time expo&s;e him; and if he en|tangleth not him&s;elf with tho&s;e things that are foreign from his department, he then is the man of honor and virtue, who plea&s;es him who hath cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier; he an&s;wers the ju&s;t expectation of his employers, who confided in him, and plea&s;es his good commander whom he obeys.</P>
<P>Thus have I con&s;idered the duty of a man in the character of a &s;oldier in his country's cau&s;e. I proceed now to con&s;ider what is &s;till more impor|tant, viz. What duties the &s;oldier owes to his divine commander, who may be &s;aid to have cho&s;en men to be &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>It may with good rea&s;on be judged that Chri&s;t has cho&s;en men to be &s;oldiers in defence of their coun|try, when invaded by an unrighteous and cruel foe; or in other words he may approve, yea, make it the duty of men to go to war in certain ca&s;es and circum&s;tances. If not, the undertaking of our young men, to compo&s;e the army, is wrong, and ought not to have been; but it is pre&s;umed
<PB N="14" REF="017438_0013_0FA11D68B477ABD0">
none of the undertakers once doubt the lawfulne&s;s of the war on our part. If the enemy have wick|edly begun and pro&s;ecuted the war again&s;t America without ju&s;t provocation, this &s;uppo&s;es our right and duty to oppo&s;e them by arms, with &s;uch weapons as God has provided for us, that we may defend our lives, liberties and properties.</P>
<P>To defend our&s;elves again&s;t the unrea&s;onable en|croachments and inva&s;ion of others is the plain dic|tate of rea&s;on; and revelation will vindicate the &s;entiment. If a defen&s;ive war is lawful, and if this war in which we have &s;o unanimou&s;ly taken a part to a&s;&s;ert our rights and privileges again&s;t the claims of the enemy; if it is a nece&s;&s;ary defen&s;ive war on our part, the enemy having fir&s;t drawn the &s;word unprovoked; then the war is lawful which we are carrying on, and if lawful, then approved of by God, for he ever approves of what is lawful: And Chri&s;t came not to de&s;troy but to fulfil the law&punc; Chri&s;t ever approves of that which is lawful and right, yea, has made it our duty to vindicate our natural rights and privileges, and therefore has cho&s;en men or called them to &s;erve in their country's cau&s;e, and for it's &s;afety and defence, as al&s;o has cho&s;en us all to &s;erve under him, he has invited us all to inli&s;t un|der his banner; and would he invite us to be his &s;ol|diers unle&s;s it was his choice that we &s;hould be &s;o? If he has invited all, then the &s;oldier engaged in his country's defence is al&s;o cho&s;en to be a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and he is bound to perform the duties which he owes to him.</P>
<P>The religion of our Saviour is as worthy and nece&s;&s;ary to be regarded by gentlemen of the military line, as any cla&s;s of men whatever, their &s;ouls being
<PB N="15" REF="017438_0014_0FA11D6974F290C0">
equally precious and their &s;alvation equally impor|tant. We find particular notice taken of the reli|gion and &s;uppliant po&s;ture of a &s;oldier who came to Je&s;us for a particular favour, which I would intro|duce in this place for the improvement of all who bear the name of &s;oldiers in this age. See Mat. viii. 5.&mdash;"And when Je&s;us was entered into Caper|naum, there came unto him a Centurion, be&s;eeching him, and &s;aying, Lord, my &s;ervant lieth at home &s;ick of the pal&s;y, grievou&s;ly tormented; and Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, I will come and heal him: The Centu|rion an&s;wered and &s;aid, Lord, I am not worthy that thou &s;hould&s;t come under my roof, but &s;peak the word only, and my &s;ervant &s;hall be healed; for I am a man under authority, having &s;oldiers under me, and I &s;ay to this man go, and he goeth, and to another come, and he cometh, and to my &s;ervant do this, and he doth it&punc;" Notwith&s;tanding the Cen|turion ranked as an officer, one in command, &s;ee! how he humbles him&s;elf in the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, exalts him whil&s;t he deba&s;es him&s;elf, and &s;ee! what notice Je&s;us took of this eminent man who was a &s;oldier. &mdash;"When Je&s;us heard it, he marvelled and &s;aid to them that followed, Verily I &s;ay unto you, I have not found &s;o great &s;aith, no not in I&s;rael." This Centurion paid more honor and re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, than to his commander in the field, as may be judged from Chri&s;t's approbation of him, and thus every &s;oldier is bound to do; for who&s;e commands &s;hould mo&s;t impre&s;s our minds, whether tho&s;e of a human or divine commander? Whil&s;t the &s;oldier &s;hould be ready to obey all the lawful commands of his re|&s;pective officers, he is not to be unmindful of but &s;trictly regard the authority of Je&s;us his divine
<PB N="16" REF="017438_0015_0FA11D6A372320A8">
Captain. This will lead the &s;oldier to con&s;ider what enemies he has to oppo&s;e, as he would be a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;piritual, which are the mo&s;t dangerous. As the &s;oldier is to be vigilant to e&s;py out his na|tural enemies &s;o as to be the better prepared to re+ceive their attack, and to repel their force, &s;o the chri&s;tian &s;oldier under Je&s;us Chri&s;t is to be vigilant to e&s;py and ready to re&s;i&s;t his &s;piritual foe; the direction given by the Apo&s;tle, is to be heeded in making this re&s;i&s;tance, 1 Peter v. 8, 9. "Be &s;ober be vigilant, becau&s;e your adver&s;ary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about &s;eeking whom he may devour," and whom think ye he will devour, except it be tho&s;e who are not &s;ober and vigilant? If ye are rude, vain and wicked, not on your guard again&s;t the attack of Satan, ye are in danger of falling an ea&s;y prey to his malevolent de&s;igns. You need therefore be more &s;trictly on your guard again&s;t this your &s;piritual foe, than your natural and bodily enemies, whom re&s;i&s;t &s;tedfa&s;t in the faith. Faith is the powerful weapon, or in&s;trument with which the de&s;igns of this evil and dangerous foe can be be&s;t warded off. If the Centurion had great faith re|corded to his honor, being a &s;oldier, it is equally important that all others &s;hould have faith in order to get true honor and the be&s;t victory. "This is the victory that overcometh, even our faith," John v. 4. But that the well di&s;po&s;ed &s;oldier may be apprehen|&s;ive of the enemies of his &s;oul and know what armour he mu&s;t put on and be clad with, in order to make head again&s;t them, he will do well to hearken to and comply with that &s;kilful and excellent advice of the Apo&s;tle, Ephe&s;. 6 chap.

be &s;trong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to &s;tand again&s;t the wiles of the devil. For we wre&s;tle not with fle&s;h and blood, but again&s;t principalities, again&s;t powers, again&s;t the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world, again&s;t &s;piritual wicked|ne&s;s in high places." Here the enemies of our &s;ouls are reckoned up as being numerous, potent and dangerous. The&s;e, we are to wre&s;tle with and oppo&s;e with &s;uch kind of armour as will be&s;t &s;ucceed. The armour is next mentioned. "Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to with&s;tand in an evil day, and having done all to &s;tand; &s;tand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the brea&s;t-plate of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and your feet &s;hod with the preparation of the go&s;pel of peace; above all taking the &s;hield of faith, wherewith ye &s;hall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of &s;alvation and the &s;word of the &s;pirit, which is the word of God." The whole chri&s;tian armour is here delineated, with which the chri&s;tian &s;oldier being clad, he is completely furni&s;hed to receive the attacks of his &s;piritual enemies, and to make a &s;ucce&s;sful war again&s;t them, in which he &s;hall finally come off victor.</P>
<P>The helmet of &s;alvation and the &s;word of the &s;pirit, which is the word of God, is an e&s;&s;ential part of that armour which the chri&s;tian &s;oldier is to take. The &s;word of the &s;pirit is &s;aid to be the word of God; and it may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the great in&s;tru|ment, in the u&s;e of which the Spirit of God operates for the &s;aving good of men, and agreeable to this is that an&s;wer given to the que&s;tion propounded in
<PB N="18" REF="017438_0017_0FA11D6C23311820">
the 119th P&s;alm, 9. "Wherewith &s;hall a young man clean&s;e his way?" The an&s;wer is direct, viz. "By taking heed thereto according to thy word." This is the way for the young man, the good &s;oldier, to clean&s;e him&s;elf and to be &s;aved from the evils, &s;nares and temptations to which his &s;oul is expo&s;ed. By taking heed, in the u&s;e and improvement of the word of God&mdash;praying always with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit, and watching thereunto with all per&s;everance, the good &s;oldier is well pre|pared, fortified and guarded again&s;t his wor&s;t enemies. This then is the &s;alutary advice to be given to the young man who would get the victory over them, and plea&s;e him who hath cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier; the urgent advice is, that he would take the word of God with him and make a prayerful and diligent u&s;e of it. By no means think the Bible and religion as things unworthy and what do not concern him in his military profe&s;&s;ion and character.</P>
<P>Religion and the fear of God is truly the be&s;t ornament and greate&s;t &s;afeguard to the young as well as aged, and except the &s;oldier be acquainted with and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, he cannot be &s;aid to be a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; without it, he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to plea&s;e Chri&s;t who has cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier &mdash;Under whom has the &s;oldier to &s;erve? and who is he bound to plea&s;e? Let it be attended to, that it is not merely under an human, but a divine commander. The orders and commands of the latter are &s;trictly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly to be ob&s;erved: But how will the orders and expre&s;s will of this &s;upreme Leader be known, without frequent recour&s;e to the word of God? As having recour&s;e to general
<PB N="19" REF="017438_0018_0FA11D6E1E103A60">
orders in the army is nece&s;&s;ary to know preci&s;ely what they are, &s;o is it no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary frequently to turn to the word of God to know what the will and commands of Chri&s;t are. It may then be judged an affair of no &s;mall concernment to know, make &s;erious u&s;e of, and improve the word of God. In this way the good &s;oldier will be clad with the riche&s;t and &s;afe&s;t armour, an armour in which he need not fear the attacks of his &s;piritual foes, and if the&s;e be vanqui&s;hed, great and important, rich and glorious will be the victory when obtained.</P>
<P>What remains will be an addre&s;s to the &s;oldiers at who&s;e reque&s;t I have &s;poken in &s;uch a &s;ort.</P>
<P>My young friends and youth of my flock. The cau&s;e in which you have engaged is &s;o good, &s;o im|portant and laudable, that it reflects honor upon any name to have it enrolled in the li&s;t of American troops, who&s;e commander is the great, the virtuous and intrepid WASHINGTON. Him and all who are actuated by his patriotic &s;pirit are you &s;tudiou&s;ly to plea&s;e, which you will do, whil&s;t you readily and faithfully di&s;charge the duties of your honourable &s;tation as &s;oldiers; you will remember the character of the tru&s;ty &s;oldier who goeth forth to war is not to entangle him&s;elf with the affairs of this life, that he may plea&s;e him who hath cho&s;en him to be a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>You have already heard it hinted who have cho&s;en and welcomed you to be &s;oldiers, viz. your employers, your fellow-citizens, your country, and further, your re&s;pective officers choo&s;e and welcome you; yea, more, the Lord God of ho&s;ts, the God of armies, choo&s;es and invites you into this important and nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="20" REF="017438_0019_0FA11D6EB66FAB40">
work of defending your much injured and greatly threatned country. It being a fixed principle and the voice of millions that our cau&s;e is good, that the &s;weets of liberty ought to be contended for at the ri&s;k of life and expence of much trea&s;ure; hence we agree, it is a duty for &s;ome to turn out to &s;erve in the war; a duty made plain by the voice of God's providence, that &s;uch a number, as is proportioned for the common &s;afety and defence, &s;hould harne&s;s them&s;elves, and with an eager de&s;ire gra&s;p the &s;word and manfully wield it till the enemy hearken to terms, and America be rid of her invaders: The &s;word in the hands of our brave &s;ons, determined to be free, or to fall as precious victims to the &s;hrine of liberty; the &s;word in &s;uch cho&s;en hands may oppo&s;e, yea vanqui&s;h our enemy and recover and e&s;tabli&s;h our indi&s;putable rights, but to &s;heathe the &s;word before the work and bu&s;ine&s;s be done for which it was fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed, will be to de&s;erve the fate of cowardly apo&s;tates who&s;e end is wor&s;e than their beginning. <HI>Now</HI> in &s;pecial, are we called to <HI>arms,</HI> to &s;upply tho&s;e vacancies, which the enemy have flattered them|&s;elves we &s;hould not be able to do &mdash; To convince them we can bring an army into the field by actually effecting it, and that &s;ea&s;onably, will probably di&s;con|cert and di&s;appoint them, and afford an happy pro&s;pect of terminating the war in our favour, and agreeable to our mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h. You, my young friends, and re&s;pectable auditors, have attended to the call of your country, and to the call of providence. Sea&s;onably have you offered your&s;elves to this important &s;ervice, are this day to take your leave of us, and proceed to join the continental army: May the duty of a faithful &s;oldier
<PB N="21" REF="017438_0020_0FA11D7085E4BA60">
from this day impre&s;s your minds, and each of you uniformly and per&s;everingly act the part of &s;uch a character: You will remember, that in the de&s;cription of a good &s;oldier, he is not to entangle him&s;elf with the affairs of this life, not to embarra&s;s him&s;elf with &s;uch things as are foreign from his department. The&s;e, in part, you have formally given up by your engage|ment. Suffer me to repeat it; you leave your farms, your trade, and &s;uch kind of bu&s;ine&s;s of life as you before had employed your&s;elves in; you leave your dear friends and connections, all your circle of agreeable acquaintance, and all your dome&s;tic con|cernments; and the&s;e would be but entanglements to you, con&s;idered as &s;oldiers: The&s;e, though you may leave with &s;ome reluctance, yet, con&s;idering the im|portance of our cau&s;e and the nece&s;&s;ary defence of this great and flouri&s;hing country, you will forego your own ea&s;e and dome&s;tic convenience, and with manly courage, with fortitude to face every danger, you will proceed, take and bear the common lot of good &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Further, you will remember that as you would not entangle your&s;elves with the affairs of this life, you are not to &s;pend your time in &s;uch things, &s;uch hurtful evils as tend to enervate and di&s;qualify from performing the duties that belong to a &s;oldier. Be you then advi&s;ed not to &s;pend that time (which &s;hould be better employed) in the &s;ins of intem|perance, gaming, profanene&s;s, debauchery, and the like, le&s;t, through the want of virtue and fidelity, the end of your undertaking &s;hould not be an&s;wered, and le&s;t the enemy get advantage of an unguarded hour. But of you, re&s;pectable &s;oldiers, I would
<PB N="22" REF="017438_0021_0FA11D73B14E48B0">
hope better things, though I thus warn you. More|over, you will take this into thought, that though there be lei&s;ure and but little fatigue and hard&s;hip at &s;ome times, yet that the occa&s;ions and cicum&s;tances of an army at others, may require long and laborious ta&s;ks. But neverthele&s;s, you will not in &s;uch times of exigency and painful trial &s;hrink back and de&s;ert the cau&s;e; you are to expect nothing le&s;s than to endure hardne&s;s, if you would be reckoned into the cla&s;s of good &s;oldiers who would pre&s;erve their credit and honor, and get the ma&s;tery.</P>
<P>Wherefore, and in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of the term &s;ol|dier, &s;ee that you con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;charge the duties of &s;uch under Chri&s;t your divine commander: It is important and nece&s;&s;ary that each of us who tarry at home be good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as we would plea&s;e him and be accepted of him, and it is no le&s;s impor|tant that you, who go forth into the perilous and high places of the field, be good, obedient and faithful &s;oldiers under Je&s;us your greate&s;t captain and leader. &mdash;Think for a moment the &s;afety of your condition in ca&s;e you enli&s;t under the banner of Chri&s;t, and be his true, tho' young di&s;clples. Then, although it might be your lot to fall in battle, you die not only honourably, but mo&s;t happily, for Je&s;us the glorious captain of your &s;alvation &s;hall give you a crown of glory that &s;hall never fade away; but if you pay no regard to your divine commander, if you choo&s;e not this man to reign over you and will not be &s;ubject to his authority and mo&s;t rea&s;onable com|mands, your condition is very un&s;afe and alarming. Be you then now advi&s;ed and fully per&s;uaded to put on the chri&s;tian armour as already directed&mdash;
<PB N="23" REF="017438_0022_0FA11D75436FA768">
Take the helmet of &s;alvation and that mo&s;t defen|&s;ive and u&s;eful <HI>&s;word,</HI> the <HI>&s;word</HI> of the &s;pirit, which is the word of God.&mdash;And be much in prayer, that ye may vanqui&s;h your &s;piritual which are your mo&s;t de&s;tructive foes. Go to your divine captain the prince of peace, in the humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive lan|guage of the renowned Centurion, that eminently good &s;oldier, who frankly owned him&s;elf unworthy that Chri&s;t &s;hould come under his roof. In a word, be religious in early life, be &s;ober-minded, vigilant and temperate, fear God and fear an oath, let no profanene&s;s proceed from your lips, your honor is better pre&s;erved in a pure than in an unhallowed u&s;e of language; as good &s;oldiers, who are &s;tudious to plea&s;e your divine leader Je&s;us (rather than to be governed by the wicked cu&s;tom of profane &s;wearing) Swear not at all, &s;eeing he has expre&s;sly forbid it. Then may you go and pro&s;per, and in God's time return in &s;afety, that you and your dear friends, who now part for a time, may meet again and mutually rejoice in a land delivered and &s;aved of the Lord.&mdash; We wi&s;h you the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord God of ho&s;ts, the God of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">mies, in the &s;hadow of who&s;e wings may you and each one of us ever tru&s;t and make our refuge.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e, May the happy time &s;oon come, when the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war &s;hall be fully and righ|teou&s;ly terminated&mdash;when you and all our friends may return to dome&s;tic life, peace and endearment, and &s;it under our vines and fig-trees, in a long uninterrupted peace, there being none to make us afraid. AMEN.</P>
