<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Author has been often induced to exhibit his Productions to the publick view, he con&s;idered the infirmities of the Seventy-&s;eventh year of his age, a &s;ufficient bar to any attempt of that kind in future; but after the People of this Town, in a manner very unu&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;e, appeared quite unanimous in taking down the old meeting hou&s;e, fixing the &s;pot for the new one, and fini&s;hing it in an elegant manner: The Undertakers, Committees, and Artificers, de&s;ired him to deliver a Di&s;cour&s;e at the Dedication of it. And then were urgent for a Copy of the Sermon for Publi|cation. And con&s;idering the &s;everal &s;ingularities of di|vine Providence in the whole affair, &s;uch as the una|nimity of the Town, in an affair, u&s;ually attended with divi&s;ion: the notable patronage of divine Providence through the perilous operations, in pre&s;erving every Per&s;on from harm; and the urgency of the gentlemen abovementioned, he &s;ubmitted, relying on publick candor, and the all&s;ufficient favour and ble&s;&s;ing of God, to &s;erve &s;ome divine purpo&s;e, by the&s;e feeble efforts.&mdash;<HI>AMEN.</HI></P>

<P>Put off thy &s;hoes from thy feet, for the place where thou &s;tande&s;t is holy ground.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE divine nature is the original, and only perfect &s;ample of all holine&s;s. Every thing therefore named holy, under God, gets that &s;tile, from &s;ome likene&s;s or relation to God. It may now be a&s;ked; but what likene&s;s or relation, can be between a piece of ground, or any other material &s;ub&s;tance, and a <HI>Spirit; immortal Being; the eternal mind?</HI> I an&s;wer, ju&s;t the &s;ame, as gave rea&s;on to the well known expre&s;&s;ions, in the old &s;tate of the church; viz: <HI>Holy Garments, holy oil, holy mountain,</HI> and as in our text, <HI>holy ground.</HI> Now there can be no degree of likene&s;s in nature, be|tween any of the&s;e material &s;ub&s;tances, and the holy God. But a relative connection with him, there certainly was, for he ordered them to be made, appointed their u&s;e, and they were accord|ing actually u&s;ed, and in the greate&s;t affair that ever took place in any world, viz: Serving eternal councels in the &s;alvation of men. Con&s;equently, in mere relative holine&s;s, no virtue or property is communicated, to give rea&s;on for the predicate, holy, to be fixed to any material &s;ub&s;tance. There can be no holine&s;s in it. What therefore God has &s;tiled holy, is to be held &s;uch for that rea&s;on,
<PB N="8" REF="024034_0005_0FC2EC50766C6B38">
without thinking of any thing in its <HI>nature</HI> an&s;wer|ing to that predicate.</P>
<P>There are two means by which this relative holine&s;s takes place. 1&s;t. When God expre&s;sly pre&s;cribes it, as Exod. xxix. 33. "<HI>A &s;tranger &s;hall not eat things con&s;ecrated becau&s;e they are holy.</HI>" So 37th ver&s;e, "<HI>The Altar is mo&s;t holy, and what&s;oever toucheth it &s;hall be holy.</HI>" Al&s;o the anointing oil; and all the uten&s;ils of the Temple, wor&s;hip, and &s;acrifices, were made holy by the &s;ame mean.</P>
<P>2nd. Another mean of this relative holine&s;s, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and u&s;e by God him&s;elf, or his &s;pecial order, &s;o the cen&s;ers which the two hundred and fifty men in Korah's rebellion, had u&s;ed by &s;pecial order, were put into golden plates to cover the altar, and never more to be u&s;ed as cen&s;ers, becau&s;e they were holy, Num. xvi. 38. So Exod. 111 5. When God po&s;&s;e&s;t and u&s;ed the burning bu&s;h, and Mo&s;es was approaching to &s;ee the &s;ight, God for|bid him, becau&s;e the place was holy; i. e. was already po&s;&s;e&s;t and u&s;ed by God him&s;elf. So when Je&s;us Chri&s;t appeared to Jo&s;hua before Je|rico; he had Jo&s;hua put off his &s;hoe, for the place was holy, being already po&s;&s;e&s;t and occupied by divine maje&s;ty. Jo&s;h. v. 15. But that cau&s;e being removed, that effect mu&s;t cea&s;e.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, how was putting off the &s;hoe an acknowledgement of holy ground? This mu&s;t be an&s;wered both litterally and mi&s;tically.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Litterally. Being barefooted was badge of a &s;ervant; a token of being always ready to run and &s;erve. Therefore the evidence of Abi|gail's con&s;ent to be David's wife was, 1. Sam. xxv. 41. That &s;he would be devoted to wa&s;h the feet of David's &s;ervants: which being bare as &s;ervants, were expo&s;ed to need wa&s;hing. And to be with|out &s;hoes, was a type of readine&s;s to &s;erve God; which was e&s;pcially nece&s;&s;ary, when the divine maje&s;ty was vi&s;ibly pre&s;ent. But when this vi|&s;ible
<PB N="9" REF="024034_0006_0FC2EC525DF63638">
pre&s;ence was withdrawn, there was no more rea&s;on for this practical re&s;pect, than in all times and places.</P>
<P>And &s;o putting off the &s;hoe in the vi&s;ible pre|&s;ence of God, was in practical reverence of his holy maje&s;ty. A &s;ign of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him; and of readine&s;s to do all his plea&s;ure. It was al&s;o a token of humiliation and mourning for &s;in. For this rea&s;on David went up mount Olivet bare|footed, in flying from his &s;on Ab&s;olom. 2. Sam. xv. 30. And to &s;hew that the temper of mind pic|tured hereby, becomes us, in the divine pre&s;ence, as well as in all humbling circum&s;tances, this &s;peaking &s;ignal was enjoined.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we may under&s;tand the mi&s;tick de&s;ign of this type, we mu&s;t know</P>
<P N="1">1. That the feet are a type of affections: For as the body moves by the feet, &s;o does the mind by the affections. This therefore gives light in Eccle&s;. v. 1. "<HI>Keep thy foot when thou goe&s;t to the hou&s;e of God.</HI>" For if not you offer there, the &s;a|crifice of Fools; i. e. a &s;acrifice, which has not your affection, love and delight in it, becau&s;e the&s;e were placed on other objects, when you came there.</P>
<P N="2">2. As our feet are placed on that which &s;up|ports our bodies, &s;o our hearts re&s;t and &s;tand, on that which is the object of the affections. And as the &s;hoe is between the foot and its foundation, &s;o it ob&s;tructs and hinders the foot from coming to that foundation. Ju&s;t &s;o every wrong object of affection interpo&s;es and hinders the mind from coming to God, tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t, and his word, as it ought; and as it mu&s;t, in order to &s;tand firm by faith. Therefore all &s;uch wrong objects of af|fection, or mental attachment, whether among outward things, or inward di&s;po&s;itions, as intercept and hinder the concurrence and compliance of the heart with holy matters, are called &s;hoes, and are
<PB N="10" REF="024034_0007_0FC2EC5D0ED3B720">
forbidden. God commands us to put them off. And unle&s;s we do &s;o, the heart can never approach to God, or comfortably enjoy him. So that in|&s;tead of this command's being a &s;en&s;ele&s;s and un|meaning thing, 'tis the &s;ummary of all practical holy religion; and quite e&s;&s;ential to the life of ho|line&s;s, and all true chri&s;tian experience.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, as ancient types looked to Chri&s;t and his kingdom which is come and e&s;tab|li&s;hed, and &s;o tipical holine&s;s antiquated; why do we retain the &s;tile of <HI>holy</HI> hill, in &s;everal in&s;tances. As in ca&s;e of the Sabbath, Bible, Ordinances, &amp;c. The fir&s;t of the&s;e only, &s;hall be attended to.</P>
<P>The holine&s;s, or morality of the Sabbath, and our bonds to its religious ob&s;ervance may be &s;up|ported in the following manner, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the only being of perfect rea&s;on, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, had perfect rea&s;on for following his own judgment in every point; and has made us know that he did &s;o, in in&s;tituting the Sabbath; then there was perfect rea&s;on for the in&s;titution; &amp; then we are under ju&s;t &s;uch bonds to ob&s;erve it. Nothing but Athei&s;m can evade this argument. For we are told Exod. xx. 9. "Six days &s;halt thou labour," &amp;c. Giving us divine liberty for our own employments, on all the&s;e days, that he might with more perfect rea&s;on, re&s;erve the following monument for him&s;elf, viz. "<HI>But the &s;eventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</HI>" He did not &s;ay it <HI>&s;hall be</HI> the Sabbath hereafter; but <HI>it is now,</HI> already the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. But if this declaration was quite right, then the Sabbath had its foundation in the nature and rea&s;on of things; for by this declaration it had perfect ex|i&s;tence, before God &s;poke a word about it. And &s;o it follows. 11th vr. "wherefore" or for which rea&s;on, "God ble&s;&s;ed," the <HI>&s;abati&s;m,</HI> for &s;o it is is in the original, i. e. confirmed it, and connect|ed ble&s;&s;ings with it, for all its faithful ob&s;ervers.
<PB N="11" REF="024034_0008_0FC2EC610D2B9118">
Tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings were not connected with the &s;e|venth day, (tho' God re&s;ted or &s;abbatized on that day) but with the &s;abbati&s;m it&s;elf. For God never de&s;igned that day of the week &s;hould always be the time for &s;abbatizing; For he knew that Je&s;us Chri&s;t would come, and would be Lord of the &s;abbati&s;m, and would di&s;po&s;e of it as he plea&s;|ed, and he did &s;o.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the only perfect being is our &s;afe pattern, and perfect example, &s;o we are bound to obey that divine commandment, Eph. v. 1. "<HI>Be fol|lowers of God, as dear children.</HI>" The in&s;pired word is <HI>Mimetai,</HI> which &s;ignifies to imitate, or mimick; but we cant do &s;o in this ca&s;e, without keeping holy the Sabbath day, for he did &s;o. He re&s;ted on the Sabbath, ble&s;&s;ed and hollowed it. And 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport the character, or enjoy the peace, of dear children of God, without imitating him, in this important ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. I would now give you a third rea&s;on for &s;anctifying the Sabbath, which avails much more for the chri&s;tian Sabbath, than for that of the Jews. But a few &s;entiments are nece&s;&s;ary to introduce it. As</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sabbath</HI> was always de&s;igned to memorialize and commemorate, the greate&s;t work which God had been know to accompli&s;h, as Exod. xx. 10.11. Where God's <HI>making the world,</HI> is the rea&s;on for &s;abbatizing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the creator of the world. Jon. i. 1. In the beginning was the word, and the word was God, all things were created by him. And Heb. i. 2. "<HI>He made the worlds</HI>;" Yea "<HI>all things vi&s;ible and invi&s;&s;ible.</HI>" Col. i. 16.</P>
<P N="3">3. As creation was then the greate&s;t work, God had been known to do, &s;o the fir&s;t, or Jewi&s;h Sab|bath was in memory of that, as the greate&s;t work of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. But redemption, wrought by the &s;ame di|vine
<PB N="12" REF="024034_0009_0FC2EC68A913C328">
agent, was infinitely greater work than creation, creation was the &s;tage on which redemption was to be wrought; it was made for that very purpo&s;e. No oppo&s;ition was made to creation; but redemp|tion was oppo&s;ed by earth and hell, and yet was accompli&s;hed. No death was nece&s;&s;ary in crea|tion; but the mo&s;t terrible death that ever was, was nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h redemption. Creation was made for bodies, and natural life; but re|demption for &s;ouls, and eternal life. So it ap|pears that redemption was an infinitely greater, &amp; more important work than creation. Therefore,</P>
<P N="5">5. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the divine agent of both, knowing when redemption was fini&s;hed in his re&s;urrection, the rea&s;on of the fir&s;t Sabbath cea&s;ed; becau&s;e now an infinitely greater divine work was to be memorialized by &s;abbatizing, con|tinued his redeeming work, through the &s;eventh day, Sabbath, and re&s;ted from his work, and &s;o &s;abbatized on the fir&s;t day of the week, Mat. xxviii 1.6. 1. Cor. xv. 4. Heb. iv. 9.10.</P>
<P>And &s;o the doctrine is e&s;tabli&s;hed, that there is infinitely greater rea&s;on for the chri&s;tian Sab|bath, than ever was for that of the Jews. And this is &s;o far from fixing changeablene&s;s on the in&s;titutor; that it gives evidence of his unchange|ablene&s;s. He always de&s;igned the Sabbath to be a memorial of the greate&s;t work of God; and now as a greater work of God has taken place, than that of creation, he fixed the memorial of it ac|cordingly. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. He cea&s;ed, or re&s;ted from his work, i. e. &s;abbatized on the fir&s;t day of the week, him&s;elf: thereby &s;etting the &s;ame example for his followers, as he did in the beginning on the &s;eventh day.</P>
<P N="2">2. He practically taught his di&s;ciples to tread in his &s;teps. Jon. xx. 19. For when the di&s;ci|ples were a&s;&s;embled, on the fir&s;t day of the week; he joined them, and in&s;tead of reproving them,
<PB N="13" REF="024034_0010_0FC2EC6A82F21EB0">
encouraged them, in the highe&s;t manner, by pro|nouncing a Sabbath's ble&s;&s;ing on them, in the&s;e mo&s;t encouraging and comfortable words; "<HI>Peace be unto you.</HI>" Implying all ble&s;&s;ings, and e&s;pecial|ly &s;piritual ones, (for peace is &s;uch) are for you, on this day, as Sabbath; and in this practice of &s;anctifying it. And becau&s;e it was a point of great importance, Luke al&s;o atte&s;ts it. Luke xxiv. 33.36. And again the next Sabbath, or fir&s;t day of the week, Je&s;us to confirm them in this practice, met with them again and ble&s;&s;ed them. See Jon. xx. 26, And the in&s;pired apo&s;tle confirms it, by directing the Corinthean Church to be pre|pared for publick contributions on the fir&s;t day of the week, as the &s;tated time of their publick a&s;&s;em|blies. 1. Cor. xvi. 2. And to encourage them in it, tells them, he had ordered the Churches of Galatia to do the &s;ame on that day. And for this rea&s;on the fir&s;t day of the week was &s;tiled em|phatically the day when di&s;ciples come together to break bread. Act. xx. 7. And there is not one word in the Bible about chri&s;tians ob&s;erving any but the fir&s;t day of the week, as Sabbath, ever &s;ince. And doubtle&s;s this was meant when Chri&s;t is called <HI>Lord</HI> of the Sabbath day. Mark, ii. 28. And &s;o it appears that the Sabbath is connected with the fir&s;t day of the week, by &s;pecial in&s;titu|tion, con&s;i&s;ting in the expre&s;s word, &amp; actual ex|ample of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is Lord of all.</P>
<P>Therefore though the &s;abbati&s;m was movea|ble from one day to another, it is in it&s;elf unchange|able, and of cour&s;e, the &s;tile <HI>holy,</HI> belongs to it ju&s;t as it did originally. Exod. xvi. 23. Neh. ix. 14.</P>
<P>As to other &s;ubjects of the predicate <HI>holy,</HI> &s;uch Bible, Ordinances, and wor&s;hip, &s;ince I am be|reaved of the u&s;e of my hand in writing, and con|&s;idering the great mercy of God to us in general, in giving us light and under&s;tanding enough to acknowledge their <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> I &s;hall only add; that
<PB REF="024034_0011_0FC2EC6CD38D0140">
no portion of meer matter can have holine&s;s in its nature. The <HI>Bible, Elements,</HI> in the Lord's Sup|per, &amp;c. are holy by &s;pecial divine order, and by their divine import. God had al&s;o once a hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, &s;tiled <HI>holy,</HI> &amp; Je&s;us Chri&s;t gives us the rea&s;on, becau&s;e it was a type and picture of his body, Jon. ii. 19.21. It was al&s;o a type and pic|ture of his Church, the collective body of his <HI>holy ones.</HI> For of them he &s;ays, 11. Cor. vi. 16. "<HI>Ye are the temple of the living God.</HI>" And 1. Tim. iii. 15. he &s;ays, "<HI>The church of God, is the hou&s;e of the liv|ing God.</HI>"</P>
<P>That hou&s;e therefore was holy by &s;pecial di|vine order, and by its tipical import. But there has been no hou&s;e in the world, entitled to the &s;tile of <HI>holy,</HI> &s;ince Je&s;us Chri&s;t a&s;cended to Heaven. And of cour&s;e, 'tis owing to ignorance, bigotry, &amp; &s;uper&s;tition, that a hou&s;e for chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, is ever &s;tiled <HI>holy, hou&s;e of God, holy place</HI>; and &s;uch like. A hou&s;e for chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, and all re|ligious wor&s;hip in any place, is to be attended in a a very holy manner. The object, and the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, are <HI>holy.</HI> The heart of the &s;ubject ought to be holy; an&s;werable to the employment.</P>
<P>I now proceed to make &s;ome remarks on the premi&s;es. And</P>
<P N="1">1. We have &s;een that there can be no holine&s;s in mere matter. Objection, Our bodies are mere matter; and yet the apo&s;tle implies, that <HI>our bodies mu&s;t be made holy.</HI> 1. The&s;&s;. v. 23.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Our bodies are holy, when they are devoted to divine &s;ervice, and in practice are con|formed to the laws of holine&s;s in the Bible, and to a principle of holine&s;s in the heart. But this implies no holy property in the matter of our bo|dies. If mere matter can't love God, which is the principle of holine&s;s; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould have holine&s;s in its nature.</P>
<P>We have &s;een al&s;o that the Sabbath is fixed to
<PB N="15" REF="024034_0012_0FC2EC6FB5AD9B90">
the fir&s;t day of the weak, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Lord: and we all know, that a primary object in building, and furni&s;hing this hou&s;e, is to &s;erve the appointed u&s;es of that holy Sabbath. And that for tho&s;e purpo&s;es &s;pecially, it is &s;olemnly de|dicated this day. If we believe the&s;e things, and have any religious, or only rational notions of them; we &s;hall never enter this hou&s;e, for any of tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;acred purpo&s;es, with malignity in|dulged in our hearts; or with the air, or &s;pirit of levity. This is not a vulgar hou&s;e; nor made &amp; furni&s;hed for vulgar u&s;es. The de&s;ign of it is to be a convenient place for the &s;ervice of God. Let every per&s;on who enters it profe&s;&s;edly for that purpo&s;e, remember God is pre&s;ent in the con|gration of his people; and that his eye is on their heart; and he will make them eat the fruit of their own ways; and fill them with their own de|vices. He will be &s;anctified in them that come near him. Lev. x. 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then our fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s in all approaches to God, is to put off every my&s;tick &s;hoe. 'Tis mo&s;t dangerous to ru&s;h into the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God, with heart and affections muffled, di&s;tem|pered, and embarra&s;&s;ed, with my&s;tick &s;hoes. Remember this is the fir&s;t thing he &s;ees about us when we approach his pre&s;ence; for he looks at the heart. Jer. xx. 12. And is much di&s;plea&s;ed with the heart that inwardly departs from the living God. 'Tis mockery to draw near to God, with a fal&s;e treacherous heart. We &s;hould al|ways remember when we enter this hou&s;e, for the &s;ervice of God, it mu&s;t be with hearts and affections quite barefooted. Otherwi&s;e we are in danger of his wrath every moment. The &s;ight of this place of wor&s;hip, &s;hould bring the thoughts to view.</P>
<P N="3">3. Divers circum&s;tances require &s;uch &s;olemn regard, in all our improvements of this hou&s;e. As</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="16" REF="024034_0013_0FC2EC74F1788530">1. There have been &s;pecial Tokens of divine patronage towards this town, re&s;pecting their place of public wor&s;hip, for &s;everal years pa&s;t. Men are apt to be jealous for &s;uppo&s;ed rights, and contentious, if they are invaded. Yet a majority of this town, who were not accommodated in the place of wor&s;hip, it being a mile from a proper centre; endured that exce&s;s of travel for ten years, in peaceable compliance with the minority. And if but one hundred per&s;ons did &s;o; then in go|ing and returning, they endured two hundred miles travail every Sabbath day. And as there are fifty two Sabbaths in a year this exce&s;s of travail on Sabbaths only, is ten thou&s;and and four hundred miles. And if other occa&s;ions of meeting there, were as many more as the Sabbaths, the travail would be more than twenty thou&s;and miles, which is nearly equal to the diameter of the terraque|ous Globe. Yet all this was endured with more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion than is common in like ca&s;es. Which is to the honor of tho&s;e who endured it. And &s;ince we are bound in all things to acknowledge divine Providence, Prov. iii. 6. And &s;ince if per|&s;ons enduring all this, had been as querulous as common in &s;uch ca&s;es, the town had been con|vul&s;ed; and our happy enjoyment of this hou&s;e had never exi&s;ted. The&s;e con&s;iderations bind us al|ways to enter this hou&s;e with grateful veneration for its bounteous author.</P>

The goodne&s;s of God was &s;o con&s;picuous, in pre&s;erving every one of the multitude em|ployed in taking down the old Hou&s;e, and erect|ing it here from any di&s;a&s;ter, that it demands a dutiful acknowledgment from every per&s;on ac|quainted with the&s;e facts, whenever they enter this hou&s;e, e&s;pecially to wor&s;hip the pre&s;erver of men.</P>
<P N="3">3. As convenient accommodation for the wor|&s;hip of God, is the honor and happine&s;s of any people; &s;o the unu&s;ual elegance of this hou&s;e, for
<PB N="17" REF="024034_0014_0FC2EC77790E9CF8">
the purpo&s;e of its pre&s;ent dedication, calls aloud on its proprietors, to honor its great object, when|ever they approach his pre&s;ence, to wor&s;hip in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third remark on the premi&s;es is, that we &s;hould pay &s;uch regard to the word of God &amp; his wor&s;hip, as never to admit any thing un&s;crip|tural, or antichri&s;tian. The Bible &s;tiled a hou&s;e for wor&s;hip and &s;acrifice, among the Jews, <HI>The hou&s;e of God, Sanctuary.</HI> &amp;c. Rea&s;ons for which have been given. But it allows no hou&s;e for chri&s;tian wor&s;hip to be &s;o &s;tiled. And &s;ince the antitype of all tho&s;e types is come, to uphold the types, is practically to &s;ay, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not come, and that he who bore that &s;tile was an impo&s;tor. And &s;o to deny chri&s;tianity, &s;peak fal&s;ehood, and &s;upport the Jews. 'Tis un&s;criptural. The Pa|pi&s;ts have holy Ground, Hou&s;es, and Places: but God bids us "<HI>come out from among them, and not touch the unclean thing.</HI>" 2. Cor. vi. 17. and doubt|le&s;s all who mean to purify them&s;elves as he is pure, will purify from the&s;e corruptions; becau&s;e they are antichri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="4">4. We have &s;een the ab&s;urdity of types, after their de&s;ign is an&s;wered. The name of Chri&s;t was <HI>to be above every name.</HI> Phil. ii. 9. <HI>His name alone to be exalted in all the earth.</HI> Pa&s;. lxvii. 10. We have &s;een al&s;o, there is more rea&s;on; infinitely more rea&s;on for the chri&s;tian Sabbath, than ever was for that of the Jews. And we have had rea|&s;on for a mo&s;t &s;acred improvement of that day; &amp; &s;ome of them are encrea&s;ed by the privilege of this hou&s;e. To which others &s;hall now be added.</P>
<P N="1">1. This hou&s;e is not made for vanity; but for the &s;ervice of God. And is this a triffling mat|ter? Is there a per&s;on among us, who don't know this demands attention, &s;olemn attention! What &s;hall be thought then of the per&s;on, old or young, who &s;hall attend wor&s;hip in this hou&s;e in a light, airy manner; comes gazing, &s;miling, gabling, in|to
<PB N="18" REF="024034_0015_0FC2EC7BCAFF5690">
a place dedicated to the &s;ervice of God? &s;uch in|decency is infinitely more aggravated, than to ru&s;h into the pre&s;ence of worldly maje&s;ty with a whi&s;|tle, which would en&s;ure the cen&s;ure of gro&s;s ill|breeding, idioti&s;m or in&s;anity.</P>
<P N="2">2. The dedication of this hou&s;e to holy u&s;es, binds us to u&s;e it in a holy manner. No guile, envy, hypocricy, or other evil habits, &s;hould be admitted here. The&s;e are &s;hoes forbidden to be worn. Indeed, tis impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;oul to draw near to God, with the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments. When we en|ter this hou&s;e therefore, remember the command, "<HI>put off thy &s;hoes,</HI> and "<HI>be &s;hod with the preparation of the Go&s;pel of Peace.</HI>"</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;hould take argument, compul&s;ive ar|gument, from divine Bounty, in the comfort, con|venience, and privilege of this hou&s;e, for holy &s;ervices and enjoyments, to become a people to the honor of a bountiful benefactor; and make it ap|pear that this grace is not ill be&s;towed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with &s;ome gratitudinary notes.</P>
<P N="1">1. We are in debt to divine Maje&s;ty, for this elegant accommodation for his wor&s;hip. God &s;aid of the fir&s;t hou&s;e for holy &s;ervices, "<HI>the &s;il|ver is mine, the gold al&s;o is mine.</HI>" Hag. ii. 8. He has indulged us the materials of this hou&s;e; &s;hall we pervert them? Shall we &s;uffer the prophana|tion of &s;uch favour? Far be it! But let us at every &s;ight of this bounty; "<HI>give unto the Lord, the glory due to his great name.</HI>" And dedicate, heart|ily dedicate, this monument of his goodne&s;s to his &s;ervice. And allow it to &s;tand a witne&s;s of our duty; and &s;olemn te&s;t of our allegiance.</P>
<P N="2">2. The People at large are to be acknowledged, for their concurrence in the important work; as al&s;o for their &s;teady approbation, and promotion of it from the fir&s;t. May divine ble&s;&s;ings here renumerate to them, all their care, and all their co&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. The undertakers, in&s;pectors, and all &s;ub|&s;ervient
<PB N="19" REF="024034_0016_0FC2EC7C7A0B0240">
committees, are to be thankfully ac|knowledged; the undertakers e&s;pecially; that when divine providence had opened a pro&s;pect of &s;omething of the kind; they indulged &s;o liberal a projection, as this which has taken place. And both they, and the In&s;pectors, are intitled to pub|lick thanks, for that good judgment, patrioti&s;m, firmne&s;s, and per&s;everance, with which the whole has been pro&s;ecuted, to the pre&s;ent perfection.</P>
<P N="4">4. But our gratitude, is eminently due, under God, the patron of all ingenious artificers; to that curious arti&s;t, who with his a&s;&s;ociates, undertook that arduous work, and who&s;e diligence, con&s;tant attention, and high mechani&s;m, have accompli&s;h|ed this brilliant accommodation for divine &s;ervice. We ought to de&s;ire that their &s;ouls might be beautified with the Grace of God, and that they might be edified to his Palace above the &s;kies.</P>
<P>And now after honouring the pre&s;ence of nu|merous friends on this agreeable occa&s;ion; we a|gain call on our &s;ouls, and all that is within us to ble&s;s and prai&s;e the name of the Lord, for all his benefits; and for this di&s;play of his favour, to his unworthy people. And dedicate this hou&s;e, as a memorial, and monument thereof; and as a te&s;t of our allegiance to his holy Maje&s;ty.&mdash;AMEN.</P>
