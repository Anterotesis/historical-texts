<P>IN the great &s;cale of beings, mankind hold a digni|fied &s;tation. The human mind, capable of improvement, under advantageous cultivation, progre&s;&s;es in knowledge and refinements, honourary in their nature, and ornamen|tal in their con&s;equences. Individuals, with privileges of this kind, &s;hine as lights in the world. Societies, compo&s;|ed of characters improved in &s;cience and virtue, have eve|ry advantage in their &s;ocial connection.</P>
<P>BY long experience, the jarring pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts of men, &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of Government. Various have been the forms, by which mankind have enjoyed di&s;tin|gui&s;hed privileges. A particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all the prin|ciples of Government, will not be expected upon this oc|ca&s;ion, as many of this re&s;pectable audience are better ac|quainted with them, than the &s;peaker. An attempt of this, would be a departure from duty.</P>
<P>THAT Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;citution, exhibited in the &s;a|cred Scriptures, is the foundation upon which the Mini&s;|ters of Religion are placed. It contains tho&s;e rules and
<PB N="6" REF="032640_0005_0FF3E24E86707BB8" MS="y">
regulations which we are called to vindicate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> we are furni&s;hed with a code of laws and precepts, admirably &s;uited to governors, and governed&mdash;rules de&s;igned to pro|mote general happine&s;s here, and to prepare for a far more exalted &s;tate in the regions of immortality. The&s;e are pe|culiar excellencies in the Oracles of Truth.</P>
<P>IN the early ages of time, Government was confined to private families; but when men multiplied, it was con&s;i&s;t|ent with infinite wi&s;dom to point out methods by which there &s;hould be a Government upon a more exten&s;ive &s;cale. This took place with the people of I&s;rael, while in the land of Egypt. The Egyptians, under a pretence that I&s;rael would increa&s;e in numbers and power, treated them in a manner incompatible with humanity. Whereupon the Lord was plea&s;ed to provide for them a deliverer&mdash;to rai&s;e up Mo&s;es, remarkably to pre&s;erve him in his infancy, to appear unto him in a burning bu&s;h, to appoint him a ruler, and to accompany him with &s;uch proofs of his divine mi&s;|&s;ion, as were convincing to a mind not clouded with ig|norance, or blinded with prejudice.</P>
<P>THE good man, with reluctance, mode&s;tly accepted the appointment, with Aaron his brother, his a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the arduous ta&s;k. Mutually &s;upporting each other, the Lord was with them. Happy for them, and thrice happy for the people, they were united by the mo&s;t endearing ties, when placed, the one a political, the other an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical leader. Aiming at the &s;ame great object, under the particular direction of Heaven, they went on, hand in hand, through a &s;eries of unexampled trials, conducting and protecting their charge, as faithful &s;hepherds guide their flocks. Connected with an ingrateful people, tho&s;e worthies met with &s;ingular difficulties in their way, were cen&s;ured when performing the will of God, and exerting every power to advance the be&s;t intere&s;t of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="032640_0006_0FF3E2511FBC0DD0">JETHRO, the prie&s;t of Midian, father-in-law to Mo&s;es, anxious for his &s;on's welfare, and &s;en&s;ible that his ta&s;k was in&s;upportable, propo&s;ed &s;ome alterations, that a part of the burden might be removed from him, and placed upon others. The&s;e we have in the theme under con&s;ide|ration&mdash;the manner of executing their &s;everal tru&s;ts &s;peci|fied&mdash;the extent of their power defined&mdash;and, in ca&s;es of intricacy, an appeal open to the chief magi&s;trate, their la&s;t re&s;ort. Here the privileges of the people were in a great mea&s;ure to be &s;ecured by the amiable characters of their rulers, and e&s;pecially by his who was their &s;upreme judge, and under the immediate influence of the King of kings.</P>
<P>THIS was the form of Government then e&s;tabli&s;hed. It was a theocracy; and its permanency &s;hews it was &s;uited to the genius of the people in that period of the world, as it continued in the days of Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, and till Samu|el's time, &s;anctioned with the approbation of Heaven.&mdash; They were governed by wi&s;e judges, given them by a God who was their guardian and friend, till his favour was for|feited by a revolt from him, ca&s;ting off his authority, and determining to have a king of their own, in imitation of the heathen nations. This conduct proceeding from a fac|tious di&s;po&s;ition, was di&s;plea&s;ing to God. Yet he granted their reque&s;t, gave them a king&mdash;but a king in judgment.</P>
<P>THE Oracles of Truth are not deci&s;ive, re&s;pecting any particular, permanent form of civil polity. We are left at liberty to adopt rules and laws agreeable to our inclina|tions. In a &s;tate of ignorance and barbari&s;m, a de&s;potic power may be nece&s;&s;ary; but where knowledge is diffu&s;ed, and rea&s;on enlightened, the ba&s;tile bars are &s;een&mdash;the &s;hackles eluded.</P>
<P>A REPUBLICAN Government, as defined by an emi|nent writer, "in which all men, rich and poor, magi&s;|trates
<PB N="8" REF="032640_0007_0FF3E1392AD583E0">
and &s;ubjects, officers and people, ma&s;ters and &s;er|vants, the fir&s;t citizen and the la&s;t, are equally &s;ubject to the laws," is doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t unexceptionable. This is the general principle which &s;upports the Government of United America, happily removed from that monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, or democracy, which have injured mankind. This form has the public good for its principal object. It re&s;ts primarily in the hands of the people; and when de|legated, is exerci&s;ed a limited period, and returns to its origin. A people with a good con&s;titution, judicious laws, in the hands of an executive authority influenced by the maxims of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, attentive to their true intere&s;t, will acquire &s;trength and &s;tability, as they im|prove in knowledge and virtue.</P>
<P>THE directions given in my text, are adapted to any people, under whatever form of Government, when wi&s;|dom and probity are their guide. And in this view, we tru&s;t they are peculiarly applicable to the people of Ameri|ca, and demand attention in all our elections to fill the offices of State, &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate. Though under di&s;&s;imilar forms, electors may be different, yet the charac|ters of the elected &s;hould be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject before us exhibits the duty of a people in the choice of their rulers, and delineates the leading traits e&s;&s;ential to tho&s;e in public office.</P>
<P>I SHALL attempt to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the &s;everal particulars here &s;pecified, to form good rulers&mdash; &s;peak of the duties of their &s;tation&mdash;then draw &s;ome infer|ences&mdash;and conclude with addre&s;&s;es &s;uited to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t particular in the choice of rulers, &s;hould be natural abilities. Able men, are &s;uch as have been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="9" REF="032640_0008_0FF3E25633740328" MS="y">
by the God of nature. As in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical de|partment, a novice is excluded; &s;o in the civil, men of &s;en&s;e and judgment are to be preferred. Men of fortitude, of re&s;olution, who fear not the faces of the unprincipled; but when occa&s;ion requires, can oppo&s;e them with firm|ne&s;s. Men of clear heads, and determined hearts. But it is not enough that men &s;hould have natural endowments; more is nece&s;&s;ary. The gifts of nature &s;hould be improved by &s;tudy and clo&s;e application, and truth inve&s;tigated in the paths of &s;cience. There &s;hould be a general knowledge of the principles of natural and political law. And without this, men are expo&s;ed; they are ea&s;ily deceived, and led into errors, di&s;graceful to them&s;elves, and injurious to their con&s;tituents. De&s;igning individuals have every advantage of the illiterate, to influence their conduct to the accom|pli&s;hment of &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es.&mdash;A good natural under|&s;tanding, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> decent and liberal acquirements, are nece&s;&s;ary ingredients in the able &s;tate&s;man.</P>
<P>ANOTHER qualification in an accompli&s;hed ruler here recommended, is the fear of GOD. This being granted, an athei&s;t can have no part or lot in this matter. A being who is believed not to exi&s;t, cannot be feared.&mdash;But be|&s;ides the&s;e, there are tho&s;e in an enlightened age of the world, who acknowledge the being of GOD, and yet are not afraid to offend him by trampling on his authority. Such are poorly qualified for eminent &s;tations in Govern|ment. An important trait in the character of a good ruler, is wanting.</P>
<P>THE fear of God is the be&s;t guard again&s;t temptations to a deviation from the rules of right. By this, human pa&s;|&s;ions are regulated, and men are influenced to "run the ways of God's commandments, rendering to all their dues &mdash;tribute to whom tribute is due, cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom,
<PB N="10" REF="032640_0009_0FF3E25A4D9956A8" MS="y">
fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour." A con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of his omnipre&s;ence to whom we are all account|able, fixes a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart, fans every &s;park of moral rectitude, and calls forth patriotic exertions. The belief of an entire dependance on him, is an impene|trable mound again&s;t an inundation of immoralities. It is the be&s;t con&s;tructed fortre&s;s again&s;t the &s;avage artillery of the prince of darkne&s;s.&mdash;Shielded with a helmet from the God of armies, the intrepid ruler marches at the head of his battalions, with prudence, fortitude, and per&s;ever|ance, which in&s;ure protection, and lead on to victory.&mdash; Examples of wi&s;dom and virtue, originating from the fear of God, have a commanding influence upon the human mind; and in all our elections, &s;uch qualifications &s;hould invariably direct our choice.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;s on to a third particular e&s;&s;ential in Jethro's rulers.&mdash;They were to be men of truth.</P>
<P>POSSESSED of a principle oppo&s;ed to fal&s;ehood and de|ceit, they were to be eminent for their integrity. This was a qualification nece&s;&s;ary in the law-givers of I&s;rael. To a man of this de&s;cription, "his yea, and nay, are Amen." His tongue is a faithful index of his mind. He &s;trictly ob&s;erves the words of in&s;piration, "Wherefore, putting away lying, &s;peak every man truth with his neigh|bour." Sen&s;ible that he is always in the pre&s;ence of the God of truth, he never allowedly deviates from its laws. Such a character, the more it is examined, the more illu&s;|trious it will appear. It will be "like the path of the ju&s;t," po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtrayed by the wi&s;e king Solomon, "which as the ri&s;|ing light, &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day."</P>
<P>ONE thing more, nece&s;&s;ary for accompli&s;hed rulers.&mdash; They &s;hould hate covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>HOWEVER contemptible a covetous di&s;po&s;ition may be, in the &s;ight of God and man, we are con&s;trained to ac|knowledge
<PB N="11" REF="032640_0010_0FF3E25DD2D50798">
it is too prevalent to give full liberty for any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne cla&s;s of men to ca&s;t a &s;tone at others. Rigid par&s;imo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;hould not be indulged in a ruler; and it certainly is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> who fears God, and has a &s;acred regard to truth. A principle of virtue is di&s;covered, in a generous di&s;regard to per&s;onal wealth, when it comes in competition with the intere&s;t of the public. When a good ruler is engaged in his office, his duty to the &s;tation arre&s;ts his fir&s;t attention; &s;elf, has only a &s;econdary place in his mind. When called to act in public, he leaves his private concerns behind him; they drop, till he has faithfully performed his higher engagements.&mdash;Pre&s;uming that the electors in this State for the pre&s;ent year, &s;o far as they have proceeded, have been actuated by the foregoing principles; that they have provided able men, fearers of God, men of truth, haters of covetou&s;ne&s;s, to compo&s;e the pre&s;ent Legi&s;la|tive A&s;&s;embly&mdash;let us proceed to offer a few thoughts upon the duties annexed to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>IT was the advice of Jethro to Mo&s;es, that the propo&s;|ed characters &s;hould be placed over the people, to be rulers of thou&s;ands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rul|ers of tens. With great propriety this may be applied to the &s;everal officers of a Republic, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, from the fir&s;t magi&s;trate.&mdash;The Federal and State Governments in America, have furni&s;hed us with con&s;titutions and laws, by which the duties peculiar to each office are a&s;certained. Our laws, however, are not like tho&s;e of the Medes and Per&s;ians, which cannot be altered. The people have al|ways a right to the exerci&s;e of their power, as the public intere&s;t may require. And may we not affirm, that in theory there is no Government &s;o rational as where elec|tions are frequent, the elected under the public eye, and to continue during the people's plea&s;ure? This is a privi|lege we enjoy. Our annual elections give us an opportu|nity
<PB N="12" REF="032640_0011_0FF3E2605EA1D3D0">
to &s;elect our be&s;t citizens to tran&s;act our public and mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s, to enact new laws, and make ap|pointments according to the exigencies of the State.</P>
<P>A GENERAL A&s;&s;embly to a Republic, in many re&s;pects &s;tands in the place of a Mo&s;es to I&s;rael; the refulgence of who&s;e virtues &s;hould re&s;emble the face of Mo&s;es, after he had received the law of the Lord on Mount Sinai. The Authority of a State is to provide men duly qualified to act in the nece&s;&s;ary departments. The reins of Govern|ment are to be given into their hands for tho&s;e purpo&s;es. Their tru&s;t is important, and when they are under the &s;o|lemnity of an oath, they are bound by the &s;tronge&s;t ties: By them, the duties of every office &s;hould be contemplated previous to a choice. And any &s;tation had better remain vacant, than be improperly filled.&mdash;Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of in&s;piration will always remain true, "When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn." "He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God."</P>
<P>A CONSCIENTIOUS regard to the principles of recti|tude in general, and a &s;trict adherence to the duties an|nexed to each office, either in the legi&s;lative or executive, whether relative to the civil, military, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical de|partments, in&s;tamp upon it a dignity, by which the vicious are re&s;trained, and the virtuous encouraged. In &s;hort, the duties incumbent upon mankind, relative to their God and each other, obligatory upon all, and tho&s;e peculiarly adapt|ed to the various offices in a well regulated Government, will be regarded with undiverted attention by every man de&s;erving public confidence.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to enumerate &s;ome of the objects which na|turally pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the mind of the wi&s;e guar|dians of a country.&mdash;The mo&s;t perfect body of human
<PB N="13" REF="032640_0012_0FF3E26368ECDE20" MS="y">
laws ever framed, have their defects; and the&s;e are made obvious by practice. In their operations, they in all re|&s;pects do not an&s;wer the de&s;igns propo&s;ed. Wi&s;e legi&s;la|tors, upon a di&s;covery of imperfections, by which the citi|zens are embarra&s;&s;ed or wronged, by which any cla&s;s of men are injured, will exert them&s;elves for a reformation, and not give over the pur&s;uit till it be accompli&s;hed. As they are the guardians of the people, fidelity to their tru&s;t demands their attention. Laws &s;hould be founded upon the principles of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice&mdash;&s;hould be few in num|ber, per&s;picuous, and punctually executed. Tho&s;e which have been made, and are now in force, ought they not to be made plain and intelligible? Might not perplexities, expences, and great inju&s;tice, be prevented, and &s;ociety highly favoured?&mdash;Explicit laws, binding mankind to the rules of ju&s;tice, are an admirable &s;ecurity to all branches of &s;ociety. Under them, contracts are valid, peaceable members of the community are protected in the enjoyment of their intere&s;ts, the profligate re&s;trained and puni&s;hed, and in a &s;en&s;e the "wrath of man is made to prai&s;e God."</P>
<P>A FREQUANT revi&s;ion of the laws and con&s;titutions of a country, with &s;uch alterations as good policy may &s;ugge&s;t, promotes that general utility which cements the various parts of &s;ociety, and forms a complete harmonious whole.</P>
<P>AGAIN.&mdash;An important object in the minds of good rulers, is, the increa&s;e of u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
<P>A FOUNDATION placed in the minds of youth, is like "good &s;eed &s;own in good ground," in its proper &s;ea&s;on; and gives the faire&s;t pro&s;pects of a happy increa&s;e to the well being of &s;ociety. The principles of virtue and know|ledge early implanted, naturally take root, and produce a luxuriant harve&s;t. Tho&s;e who are thus favoured, are "trained up in the way they &s;hould go," the be&s;t promp|ter
<PB N="14" REF="032640_0013_0FF3E2681DBE0768" MS="y">
on life's devious journey.&mdash;Hence the propriety of hav|ing able in&s;tructors, who&s;e morals and language are wor|thy of imitation. And hence the nece&s;&s;ity of giving ample encouragement, in a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o important and laborious. Though honourable donations have been made for the promotion of literature, yet the fo&s;tering hand of our civil fathers may be required for bringing to maturity. May it not then be expected, that every aid and encouragement will be given to education? The views of &s;uch as are young, are hereby extended; they are rai&s;ed above the grovelling vulgari&s;ms too common to that age, which will have a happy influence upon &s;ociety, in preparing the ri&s;|ing generation to fill with honour the mo&s;t dignified &s;ta|tions, when they may be called to act upon the theatre of life.</P>
<P>Is there not a third and an important object in the mind of rulers, viz. the increa&s;e of virtue and religion?</P>
<P>THE ideas which have by &s;ome been adopted, that the civil authority &s;hould never interpo&s;e in matters of religion, are erroneous. It is granted by the mo&s;t learned politi|cians, that the religious forms which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;upported, have had a powerful tendency to promote civility, to re&s;train vicious men, to protect the innocent, to countenance worthy pur&s;uits, and to di&s;countenance the immoralities which have contaminated mankind! Senti|ments of this nature have flowed from knowledge and ex|perience. And if they be well founded, is it not a truth, that e&s;tabli&s;hments of this kind invite the attention that civil policy which is the &s;upport of Government? If therefore, virtue and religion form the principal pillar which upholds the civil &s;abrick, it is evidently a duty for wi&s;e rulers to contribute &s;omething for its &s;upport. Upon this principle, many profe&s;&s;ed dei&s;ts contribute with cheer|fulne&s;s and liberality to public teachers of morality; they
<PB N="15" REF="032640_0014_0FF3E26BAAE644F0">
are patrons to the wor&s;hip of God in go&s;pel order. They have con&s;idered it as a mea&s;ure wi&s;ely adapted to uphold Government&mdash;and in this they de&s;erve an encomium.</P>
<P>SUCH as fully believe the Chri&s;tian religion, and re|ceive the Scriptures as the Word of God, have additional motives for their utmo&s;t exertions that &s;obriety and good|ne&s;s may be promoted. It is indi&s;putable, that the more a &s;ociety live in the practice of virtue, the greater pro&s;pe|rity they enjoy: The more they are under the influence of vicious principles, the more unhappine&s;s they will expe|rience. The &s;acred Oracles give us the be&s;t directions. In them, no unrea&s;onable re&s;traints are impo&s;ed, no ra|tional enjoyments are forbidden. Exce&s;s alone is tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. So far as the Scriptures are &s;trictly regarded, &s;o far every member of the community conducts with pro|priety. The various propen&s;ities and pa&s;&s;ions peculiar to human nature, are directed to right objects. And there, <HI>CHRIST,</HI> a mo&s;t faithful and compa&s;&s;ionate legi&s;lator, &s;tands, giving law to his &s;ubjects. In tho&s;e records, his character is exhibited, his maxims are regi&s;tered, his ex|ample left for our imitation; and the whole perfectly re|concileable to virtue, religion, and the be&s;t policy. Thence may be extracted wi&s;dom and in&s;truction to guide us into the paths of rectitude; to &s;ave us from de&s;tructive cour&s;es of error and delu&s;ion. Here is a con&s;titution worthy the particular notice of every man who holds an office in Go|vernment; that under the influence of its rules, he may be in&s;trumental in diffu&s;ing virtuous and benevolent prin|ciples. Directed by this, he will give his public te&s;timony in favour of tho&s;e who are engaged profe&s;&s;ionally to pre|pare mankind for ble&s;&s;ings in this life, and a glorious fu|ture reward.</P>
<P>ONE farther e&s;&s;ential in good rulers, is, that they are them&s;elves exemplary.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="032640_0015_0FF3E26D2F7E7668">THERE can be no greater burle&s;que upon the character of rulers, than when, under binding obligations to God, and their con&s;tituents, they are making laws which they are the fir&s;t in violating!&mdash;But how agreeable are the pro&s;|pects, when judicious laws are made, are e&s;teemed &s;acred, and are punctually ob&s;erved by the enactors? A &s;anction is hereby placed upon them, which impre&s;&s;es every mind. And &s;ocieties having their eye upon their rulers, ob&s;erving their con&s;i&s;tency, are led to follow their example, which naturally tends to rectify the vices and to reform the man|ners of the community. When precept and example are harmonious in rulers, every ob&s;erver is charmed with the character; when they are at variance, they cannot fail to produce contempt. Of great importance then it mu&s;t ap|pear, for tho&s;e who are clothed with authority, to have the qualifications de&s;cribed in my text, to be them&s;elves exem|plary, and let their light &s;hine before men, who, aiming at one great object, the be&s;t intere&s;t of the public, are fill|ed with pre&s;ent animation; and their views, not confined to this life, are extended, and terminate in immortality.</P>
<P>THE di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall be clo&s;ed with an improvement&mdash; and with addre&s;&s;es &s;uited to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ugge&s;tions which have been given, exhibit the nece&s;&s;ity of a Government e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the principles of rea&s;on, and guarded by the maxims of ju&s;tice and virtue. The pa&s;&s;ions natural to men, indicate that we were form|ed for &s;ociety&mdash;and they powerfully excite us to enter into &s;ocial connections. From a &s;tate of natural equality, com|munities are formed. The infirmities of men require pro|tection&mdash;their vices, re&s;traints and puni&s;hment. A free Government, therefore, under which the virtuous are en|couraged, and the vicious puni&s;hed, is the palladium of the rational mind. How important, then, that it &s;hould be &s;upported; that every aid &s;hould be given to tho&s;e who
<PB N="17" REF="032640_0016_0FF3E2714C3FA2A8" MS="y">
are entru&s;ted with authority, &s;o long as they perform their duty. Vigilance re&s;pecting rulers, a check to prevent an undue exerci&s;e of power, are requi&s;ite, to pre&s;erve inviol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te the liberties and privileges of a people.&mdash;An unre&s;trained authority is dangerous; witne&s;s Hazael, Haman, and the unfortunate Charles. Extremes are always attended with con&s;equences mo&s;t unfavourable. Tyranny and anarchy, equally pernicious! An oppo&s;ition to good Government is inexcu&s;able, as it "re&s;i&s;ts an ordinance of God." A tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an unju&s;t authority, di&s;covers a pu&s;illa|nimity derogatory to the human mind.&mdash;Wherever a ju&s;t Government is wanting, as an "hidden trea&s;ure" it &s;hould be &s;ought and e&s;tabli&s;hed. Where it hath been enjoyed, and is become deficient, it &s;hould be carefully amended, as was before hinted. Too great efforts cannot be made to uphold and perpetuate a well-founded Government&mdash; and continued exertions will facilitate its ri&s;ing in re&s;pect|ability.</P>
<P>FROM the ideas which have been brought into view, may not the people of America felicitate them&s;elves under our pre&s;ent forms of Government, and in the general cha|racters of our rulers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in exalted &s;tations? Though we may not be favoured with &s;upreme magi&s;|trates who have an immediate intercour&s;e with Heaven, as had Mo&s;es the law-giver of I&s;rael; yet we may pre&s;ume that they have been, and are, favoured with the approving pre&s;ence of God.</P>
<P>OUR con&s;titutions of Government, though they may be imperfect, &s;tand high in the e&s;timation of the enlight|ened and impartial among the nations of the earth: And under them, we have rea&s;on to rejoice in a general pro&s;|perity. If virtue and attention are not with us dormant, little can be wanting to complete the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032640_0017_0FF3E2776874F6D0" MS="y">WHEN we take a retro&s;pect of the &s;cenes through which we have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince the commencement of our late conte&s;t, our minds upon the recollection are impre&s;&s;ed with a trembling, grateful plea&s;ure. In con&s;equence of injuries and in&s;ults, with but little more than a &s;ling and &s;tone we encountered the Giant, and foiled Britain!</P>
<P>A PROPITIOUS Providence, like the "pillar of a cloud and of fire to I&s;rael," led the American armies.&mdash; And not le&s;s apparent hath been the hand of God, in our civil operations. The organization of our Governments, hath been attended with &s;alutary effects in the increa&s;e of property and re&s;pectability.&mdash;After our thankful acknow|ledgments to God, the great Superintendent, we &s;hould not neglect to expre&s;s gratitude to a <HI>WASHINGTON,</HI> a <HI>Franklin,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">,</HI> a <HI>Jay,</HI> and to other heroes who have been in&s;trumental in accompli&s;hing tho&s;e great purpo&s;es, &s;o much for the honour and intere&s;t of the American States, and for the happine&s;s of future generations.</P>
<P>SHALL we not &s;pend a moment in contra&s;ting our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances in a &s;tate of peace, with what we experienced when involved in the horrors of war?&mdash;in contra&s;ting our &s;ituation, with many of the European na|tions who&s;e garments are now &s;tained with human blood? &mdash;Let us read the hi&s;tory of the French revolution, and we &s;hall have additional rea&s;on to rejoice in God for his favours, and in the language of in&s;piration mu&s;t &s;ay, "hitherto hath the Lord helped US."</P>
<P>AGAIN.&mdash;From the reflections we have been making, we learn the advantages of a virtuous Government.&mdash;If we look into the &s;acred hi&s;tory, we find the pro&s;perity of I&s;rael ebbing and flowing with the morality of their &s;ove|reigns. When they had good kings, heavy judgments were averted; but when their rulers were vicious, they
<PB N="19" REF="032640_0018_0FF3E278EC09DD60">
for&s;ook the Lord, ran into idolatry, expo&s;ed them&s;elves, and judgments came upon them like a flood! They be|came &s;o abandoned, that God &s;aid of them by his prophet, "Though Mo&s;es and Samuel &s;tood before me, my heart could not be towards this people; ca&s;t them out of my &s;ight, and let them go forth."</P>
<P>AND hath it not been generally true, that ignorance, a neglect of God and his wor&s;hip, idlene&s;s, luxury, di&s;&s;olute manners, and factions, have been certain preludes to the de&s;truction of States and Empires? Is not this abundant|ly proved by the hi&s;tories of ancient times? Was not this verified in the de&s;truction of Sparta, Athens, Rome?&mdash; And if we may rea&s;on from pa&s;t events, we may &s;afely pre&s;ume, that like cau&s;es will produce &s;imilar effects, however WE may be involved in the i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>THOUGH it plea&s;es God not to reward or puni&s;h indi|viduals in this life, according to their merit or demerit, as appears by the hi&s;tories of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, by the parable of Dives and Lazarus, by the pro&s;perity of Nero, and the misfortunes of LOUIS; yet Heaven hath balanced national virtue by affluence, and vice by a coun|terpoi&s;e of adver&s;ity. Nothing, then, can be a greater &s;timulus to a virtuous Government, to adopt the mo&s;t en|ergetic mea&s;ures, that religion and every &s;pecies of virtue may be encouraged. On the other hand, that vice, with its baneful retinue, and whatever may be derogatory to the citizen, the &s;tate&s;man, or the chri&s;tian, may be di&s;|countenanced, and meet with an exemplary puni&s;hment! &mdash;The officers of Government have a price put into their hands, to promote the intere&s;t of their brethren, and the common cau&s;e of virtue. And when they are repeatedly, by the &s;uffrages of their country, called into office, it is an evidence in their favour, and a public declaration, that their pa&s;t conduct hath been approved.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="032640_0019_0FF3E15842BCFD20">MANY of our civil Fathers, upon the pre&s;ent anniver|&s;ary, have frequently been &s;elected to act as guardians to the people of this State.

<HI>My Brethren and Friends,</HI></P>
<P>EVERY effort of ours, to promote virtue, and to op|po&s;e the prevalence of vice, contributes &s;omething to &s;trengthen the hands of our civil rulers: Their exertions for the accompli&s;hment of the &s;ame purpo&s;es, encourage our hearts.

<P>SOMETHING by way of addre&s;s to this re&s;pectable audience, &s;hall fini&s;h the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>My Friends and Fellow Citizens,</HI></P>
<P>AFTER a &s;eries of &s;ignal interpo&s;itions, the inhabitants of this land are placed upon the &s;hores of Freedom, with the olive branch flouri&s;hing in their hands. Heroes in the field, wi&s;e men at the head of the civil polity, with a pre|vailing intercour&s;e with Heaven, have brought on the pre&s;ent Aera. For years pa&s;t, no nation ever experienced greater pro&s;perity. "The voice of joy and health have been heard in our habitations;" the earth hath teemed with a profu&s;ion of rich trea&s;ures; "the little hills have rejoiced on every &s;ide."</P>
<P>ARTS and Sciences have flouri&s;hed; and a &s;pirit of enterprize, before unknown in the annals of our country,
<PB N="22" REF="032640_0021_0FF3E15AA961C3E8">
hath been di&s;played, not in opening deep waters, that tra|vellers may go through dry &s;hod, but in providing &s;afe pa&s;&s;ages over them; and al&s;o to divert the watery element into different channels, to facilitate the labours of men.&mdash; Perhaps no period was ever &s;o favourable for the general increa&s;e of property, as what we are now experiencing.</P>
<P>THIS life is a changing &s;cene. Pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity await mankind, under the &s;uperintendency of unetring wi&s;dom. Though we have been a highly privileged people, this may not continue. Pro&s;perity too often produces luxury, which leads to a decay of virtue, to irreligion, and ruin.&mdash;May Heaven divert our feet from paths &s;o danger|ous, and lead us on in the way of truth and &s;afety. This is the cour&s;e to preferments&mdash;it is the high way to honour and happine&s;s, and a prologue to immortal joys.</P>
<P>LET us then cultivate virtue in our&s;elves&mdash;carefully avoid &s;hading the light of rea&s;on, counteracting remon|&s;trances of con&s;cience, and what is recorded in God's word. In the &s;teady practice of every duty to God, to &s;o|ciety, and our&s;elves&mdash;under the influence of caution, can|dour, and genero&s;ity&mdash;we may expect the divine approba|tion.&mdash;When we act as electors, our eyes &s;hould ever be upon the "faithful of the land." We &s;hall, no doubt, have frequent calls for elections to the mo&s;t important of|fices. This is verified by late experience&mdash;by the retirement of our worthy Chief Magi&s;trate, at a critical period; and the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who&s;e pa&s;t eminent &s;ervices have given him the be&s;t title to public confidence. Calls of this nature &s;hould be improved to awaken our vigilance, that we may obtain a true knowledge of the mo&s;t de&s;erving, and of tho&s;e of a contrary de&s;cription; that our future proceed|ings may be con&s;onant to the principles of rea&s;on and &s;ound policy.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="032640_0022_0FF3E28518B4CC70">MAY the Great Superintendent give wi&s;dom to our Supreme Government at their pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, in tran&s;ac|tions of the highe&s;t moment to the States of America&mdash; that prudence, fortitude, and unanimity, may mark eve|ry movement, and in&s;tamp a dignity upon our national character. With a rational confidence in that authority, under God, we re&s;t our political &s;afety.&mdash;We rely upon their wi&s;dom and integrity.</P>
<P>PRESUMING that we &s;hall not be deceived, we &s;hall ever be ready to &s;upport Government, to reward all who are faithfully di&s;charging the duties of their &s;tations, from tho&s;e who are rulers of thou&s;ands, to &s;uch as are only rulers of tens.</P>
<P>UPON a reflection, that we have all a part to act in the drama of life, our minds cannot but be impre&s;&s;ed; that our &s;everal &s;tations require various exerci&s;es! "That though on earth the powers that be are ordained of God," and cannot be di&s;regarded but by incurring the divine di&s;plea&s;ure; yet we are accountable to Higher Powers, and ere long mu&s;t a&s;&s;emble at the Bar of the Great Judge of all the earth!</P>
<P>KEEPING that &s;olemn period ever in view, let us per|form our parts in life with a cheerful &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, as in the pre&s;ence of an Omni&s;cient God. With lives regulated by the maxims of truth, by the illuminations of the divine &s;pirit, let us "run the ways of God's commandments," di&s;&s;eminating light and knowledge, till we are prepared to enter into a world of glory, where virtue alone will digni|fy and exalt every immortal &s;pirit, in the immediate pre|&s;ence of God, of the Redeemer, in the &s;ociety of Angelic Ho&s;ts and innumerable glorified Saints&mdash;where one chorus of prai&s;e &s;hall commence, progre&s;s in cea&s;ele&s;s ages, and &s;ubordinate power be ab&s;orbed in Heaven's Sovereign.</P>
