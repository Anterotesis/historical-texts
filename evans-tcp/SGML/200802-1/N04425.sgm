<P>&mdash;And thy Father is a Man of War&mdash;.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THESE Words are a Branch of <HI>David</HI>'s Character, one of the mo&s;t politic Princes and greate&s;t Captains of his Day; to who&s;e military Prowe&s;s, under GOD, was owing the growing Great|ne&s;s of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Nation, now near the Summit of it's Perfection. The Fame of him had gone far and wide, beyond the Limits of <HI>Judea</HI>; his very Name opened to him the Way to Victory, <HI>and the Lord bro't the Fear of him upon all Nations.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. xiv.17.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005470_0008_101838593472F8B0">This is not the only Place in which the &s;ame Character is given him. It was part of the Recommendation which in|troduced him at fir&s;t into the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Saul,</HI> and opened the Way to his Marriage with a Daughter of that King, and after|wards to the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>That this was his e&s;tabli&s;hed Character appears, not only from the Hi&s;tory of his Life, but al&s;o from the Argument of <HI>Hu&s;hai,</HI> the King's Friend, in the Text and Context; and the Succe&s;s of it. For to what el&s;e is it to be a&s;cribed, but the Terror of his Name, that the Coun&s;el which <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> gave, &s;o manife&s;tly de&s;igned to further the E&s;cape of the King, &s;hould prevail in Oppo&s;ition to that of <HI>Ahitophel,</HI> the Oracle of the Age? Which, had it been pur&s;ued, mu&s;t undoubtedly have i&s;&s;ued in the utter Ruin of <HI>David,</HI> and the E&s;tabli&s;hment of his rebellious Son in his u&s;urped Dominion? It was <HI>Ahitophel</HI>'s Opinion that the King was now to be followed with a &s;elect Body of Troops, while weary and weak handed: And that he knew well, this was the Moment of Succe&s;s and Victory, and Cri&s;is of <HI>Ab&s;olom</HI>'s Affairs, appears from the De&s;pair into which he fell upon his Coun&s;el's being rejected.</P>
<P>From this probable De&s;ign, <HI>Ab&s;olom</HI> and his Courtiers were diverted by the Argument of <HI>Hu&s;hai,</HI> in which he &s;trenuou&s;ly applies to their Fears; and repre&s;ents the Danger of the Enter|prize from the heroick Qualities of <HI>David</HI> and his Men. <HI>Thou knowe&s;t thy Father and his Men,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that they be mighty Men; and they be chaffed in their Minds, as a Bear robbed of her Whelps in the Field:</HI> AND THY FATHER IS A MAN OF WAR, <HI>and will not lodge with the People.</HI> Here let me ob&s;erve, This is not the fir&s;t Time that a well laid wicked De&s;ign hath been conducted to the true Moment of Execution, and then failed thro' Cowardi&s;e, and, perhaps, the magnified Dangers repre&s;ented by a guilty Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The Phra&s;e of the Text is capable of the greate&s;t Latitude&punc; Yet I &s;uppo&s;e, by what follows, <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> had his Eye upon the <HI>political</HI> Part of it. <HI>Ahitophel</HI>'s Scheme propo&s;ed to &s;mite the King only, and bring back all the People. And to this it is that <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> an&s;wers, <HI>Thy Father is a Man of War and will not lodge with the People&punc; Behold he is now hid in &s;ome Pit, or &s;ome other Place.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005470_0009_1018385E0EB11008">From the Words taken in the large&s;t Sen&s;e, I might enter into the <HI>military Character</HI> of an accompli&s;hed Soldier, de&s;cribe the Art of War, and point out and recommend the be&s;t Manner of making it. But this I hope would be without my Province, becau&s;e I am &s;ure it is beyond my Capacity. But the <HI>gracious Character,</HI> and moral Accompli&s;hments of a <HI>military</HI> Man, may well fall under the Con&s;ideration of a Mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST, and a Teacher of that Go&s;pel, in which is bro't down from Heaven, the Wi&s;dom which is nece&s;&s;ary for Men in every Station and Condition in Life. Con&s;idering therefore the words of my Text as &s;poken of a <HI>religious</HI> Hero, I &s;hall hence take Occa&s;ion to &s;peak to <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> Soldiers of that gracious Turn of Mind, and tho&s;e vertuous Accompli&s;hments, which will crown their military Atchievements, and be their Security and Glory. This will be to con&s;ider RELIGION in a peculiar Light, and as it hath a &s;pecial Relation to a particular Order of Men; a Light in which, I confe&s;s, I have not been much u&s;ed to con|&s;ider it; a Light in which I little expected ever to be called to con&s;ider it, and lea&s;t of all upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon the&s;e Words, what I propo&s;e to do is,</P>
<P N="1">I. To con&s;ider more generally, <HI>true Religion,</HI> as a very u&s;e|ful and nece&s;&s;ary Qualification in the Character of a <HI>Soldier.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I &s;hall &s;elect out of the Circle of CHRISTIAN GRACES, &s;ome Vertues as the peculiar <HI>Accompli&s;hment</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of a Soldier.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>True Religion</HI> is a very requi&s;ite Qualification, in the Character of a <HI>Soldier.</HI> By true Religion, as it appears in the Life, I mean the Man, that, from a ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of his Obligations to his Maker and him&s;elf, and an effectual Belief of the Doctrines and Motives revealed by CHRIST in the Go&s;pel, hath made a deliberate and mo&s;t &s;incere Re&s;ignation of him&s;elf to GOD; and who&s;e Heart, hereupon, is by divine Grace &s;tedfa&s;tly re&s;olved to pur&s;ue eternal Life, in the Pre|&s;ence of GOD and CHRIST, as his great End, and to make every other Con&s;ideration give Way to this. As there is nothing more rea&s;onable, than that all our Faculties &s;hould be devoted to the Service of GOD, who gave them and claims them, and
<PB N="12" REF="005470_0010_1018385F9A71B6E0">
who hath, of his free unmerited Grace in Chri&s;t, been plea&s;ed to promi&s;e to reward the due Exerci&s;e &amp; Improvement of them; &s;o it will be found, upon Examination, to add a true Lu&s;tre to all the Glories of this World, direct the Exerci&s;e of every Power to its proper End, and give it fre&s;h Vigour in all its Opera|tions. Every Order of Men, and the <HI>military</HI> Order in par|ticular, may, if they con&s;ider the Matter, ea&s;ily di&s;cern the great Advantage of Religion in their proper Calling. I will endeavour to illu&s;trate this Point, as briefly as I can, in a few Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. One Advantage of Religion to the Soldier is: it <HI>rectifieth his Aims</HI> and directeth them to true and noble Ends. It enlargeth his Views beyond the Limits of this &s;hort Life, and elevates his De&s;igns to the un&s;peakable and eternal Glories of the heavenly World; which otherwi&s;e would be confined to the Glories of this, and a deathle&s;s Fame, as he imagines, after him&s;elf is dead. In&s;tead of this imaginary Immortality, he pur&s;ues a real one; and con&s;iders him&s;elf as happy in this, that GOD hath placed him in &s;uch a Condition of Life and Calling, as gives him an Opportunity to exerci&s;e the &s;ublime&s;t Grace, whereby he may come at la&s;t to &s;hine in di&s;tingui&s;hing Glory.</P>
<P>There is indeed a <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> in this World, which is then vertuous when it is pur&s;ued in the Paths of Reli|gion, and in Subordination to the Glory of GOD. All De&s;ire of Glory is not a faulty Ambition, any more than all Love of the World is the Sin of Covetou&s;ne&s;s; and God him&s;elf hath been plea&s;ed to gratify this De&s;ire, as a Reward of a religious Care to glorify him. <HI>Them that honour me,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>I will honour; and they that de&s;pi&s;e me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 2.30.</NOTE> This De&s;ire of Honour here, under a religious Regulation, as it is in generous Minds a mighty Principle of Action, is &s;uted to the noble&s;t Purpo&s;es, gives the World the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Examples of great and gracious Actions, and is of mo&s;t efficacious In|fluence in the Hand of Providence, in bringing about its great De&s;igns. And the Soldier, of all Men, is &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t to know it's Power and Influence upon the Minds and Actions of Men.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005470_0011_1018386126FB2428">But it is the Character of the <HI>chri&s;tian Soldier,</HI> to make every Pro&s;pect of worldly Glory give Place to his Hopes of that which is above. And if at any Time he finds him&s;elf inclined to pur&s;ue worldly Honour, by any Means incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e Hopes, he con&s;iders it as a Stratagem of his Grand Adver&s;ary the Prince of Darkne&s;s to de&s;troy him. And with a ju&s;t Indignation replies to it, as the Captain of his Salvation did before him, <HI>get thee behind me Satan.</HI></P>
<P>Now, this is one great Advantage of Religion to a Soldier; ina&s;much as, by directing his Aims to the Glory of God, it alters the Nature of his Actions, is a Re&s;traint from Wickedne&s;s and Motive to Vertue, and puts him in the Way of obtaining true Happine&s;s and everla&s;ting Honour. For he may be a&s;&s;ured, that as CHRIST <HI>made him&s;elf of no Reputation, and became obedient to Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s,</HI> and was therefore by GOD <HI>highly exalted,</HI> and had a <HI>Name given him above every Name, that at the Name of</HI> JESUS <HI>every Knee &s;hould bow</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. 2.7, 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> he al&s;o &s;hall be glorified with him, if he imitates his great Example.</P>
<P N="2">2. True Religion makes the Soldier a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing to the World.</HI> For hence, every Enterpri&s;e being undertaken and conducted with a Regard to the Will of GOD, and con&s;equently to the Laws of Equity and the good of Mankind, he will not come within Reach of the P&s;almi&s;t's Imprecation, <HI>Scatter thou the People that delight in War</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 68.30.</NOTE>. The charitable Spirit of the Go&s;pel, governing in his &s;anctified Mind, makes him value le&s;s the Glory of Conque&s;t than the Happine&s;s of his Fellow-Crea|tures. He will abhor the Tho'ts of murdering them by Thou|&s;ands and ten Thou&s;ands to eterni&s;e his own Name; and would not invade a peaceable Neighbour, contented within his own ju&s;t Limits, tho' to open the Way to univer&s;al Empire, and be renowned as <HI>Alexander,</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>No; if he Delights in War, it is to &s;uppre&s;s the injurious Spirit, and, if po&s;&s;ible, de&s;troy it out of the World. For &s;uch an End he <HI>willingly offers him&s;elf unto the Lord,</HI> devoting the Strength of his Body, the Fortitude of his Mind, his E&s;tate and
<PB N="14" REF="005470_0012_101838636357D230">
Life, and all that is dear to him. Such a Soldier is a Ble&s;&s;ing to the World, the Defence of the weak, the Security of his Country, and the Scourge of cruel and ambitious Tyrants, the great Di&s;turbers of the Repo&s;e and Happine&s;s of Mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3. True Religion engageth the <HI>Providence of</HI> GOD <HI>on our Side,</HI> and this is of the greate&s;t Importance to the Soldier. For, whatever athei&s;tical Men have imagined, there is a GOD in Heaven, who is no unconcerned Spectator of what is done on Earth; but holds the Reins of Government in his Hands, and who&s;e Coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand again&s;t all the Devices of the Sons of Policy and War. <HI>He putteth down one and &s;etteth up another. He maketh the Wrath of Man to prai&s;e him, and the Remainders of Wrath he re&s;trains. It is he who giveth Victory to Kings. Thine O Lord, is the greatne&s;s, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory and the Maje&s;ty; and all that is in the Heavens and the Earth is thine; and there is no Re&s;traint to the Lord to &s;ave by many, or by few.</HI></P>
<P>This is not a Doctrine peculiar to Revelation; but hath been a&s;&s;ented to and practiced upon by the Heathen World. And even tho&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lacedemonians. <HI>Plut.</HI></NOTE> Nations, that, from Ignorance of the &s;upreme Being, and confined Views of the Nature and Perfections of the Deity, accounted it no better than Profanene&s;s and Irreverence to their Gods, to invoke them upon Occa&s;ions of le&s;&s;er Moment, could not mi&s;s this glaring Truth. There is a divine Providence governing the World, which by &s;olemn Prayer is to be engaged on our Side in the great Concerns of War.</P>
<P>What &s;ignifies then the mo&s;t refined Policy, or the greate&s;t Expertne&s;s in military Affairs, if GOD be with our Adver&s;aries? <HI>If the Lord be not on our Side, when Men ri&s;e up again&s;t us, they will &s;wallow us up quick, when their Wrath is kinled again&s;t us.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 124, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the truely religious Soldier hath the greate&s;t Encourage|ment to hope in that Providence which extends it &s;elf to the minute&s;t Circum&s;tances, as well as to the mo&s;t important Ac|tions. And our Saviour hath taught him to conclude that he,
<PB N="15" REF="005470_0013_10183867301D4A90">
who cloaths the Lillies of the Field, who feeds the Ravens, and who&s;e Providence is concerned in the Fall of a Sparrow, will much more concern him&s;elf for his own Children.</P>
<P N="4">4. By Religion tho&s;e particular <HI>Graces</HI> or <HI>chri&s;tian Vertuos</HI> are formed into the Soul, and maintained and cheri&s;hed there, which are the Soldiers peculiar Glory, and of the greate&s;t U&s;efulne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity in his Calling. It is my De&s;ign, as I propo&s;ed, to &s;peak to &s;ome of the&s;e more particularly pre&s;ently. But here I would &s;ay more generally and briefly.</P>
<P>By Religion the Soldier learns to de&s;pi&s;e the Terrors of Death. A pro&s;pect of U&s;efulne&s;s in this World makes him wi&s;h to live, that he may attain to the greater Glory hereafter, in the future World: But his Apprehen&s;ion of that Glory makes him wi&s;h <HI>to depart and be with Chri&s;t.</HI> By Religion then he is formed to live u&s;efully, or to die nobly: He is fitted for his Calling in all Conditions, being equally prepared for Victory or Death; and having re&s;igned him&s;elf to the Will of GOD, and learned in every State to be content, nothing can come ami&s;s. If Dan|gers ari&s;e, if the Clouds gather, and the Heavens grow black, and all the Pre&s;ages of a de&s;olating Tempe&s;t appear, his religious Mind quiets it &s;elf in GOD. He is exerci&s;ed in the U&s;e of Weapons peculiarly fitted for the <HI>evil Day</HI>; and hath Advant|ages above others to with&s;tand; and, <HI>having overcome all, to &s;tand.</HI> The <HI>Brea&s;t-Plate of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Shield of Faith,</HI> and <HI>the Hope of Salvation</HI> are his Defence; and <HI>the Sword of the Spirit,</HI> the dread of his &s;piritual Adver&s;aries, may well be &s;o of his earthly ones. By his Prayers, the threatned Dangers are diverted, or he is carried thro' them, and &s;ometimes mar|vellou&s;ly crowned with Succe&s;s and Victory. But the wor&s;t that can happen is temporal; and this he little regards.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if he &s;ucceeds according to his Wi&s;hes or beyond them, he &s;till maintains an equal Temper of Mind. As Adver&s;ity cannot depre&s;s him, neither can Succe&s;s elate him into any indecent Mi&s;behaviour. And this too Religion doth for him, by begetting and keeping up in his Mind a continual Sen&s;e and Expectation of everla&s;ting Joys in the Pre&s;ence of GOD; Joys too big to leave Room for the meaner ones of
<PB N="16" REF="005470_0014_1018386BE8D7FE60">
this &s;hort Life; and too entertaining to give way to them.</P>
<P>I proceed now,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider &s;ome <HI>chri&s;tian Graces</HI> as the peculiar <HI>Ac|compli&s;hments</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of a Soldier.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Front of the&s;e &s;tands <HI>Fortitude.</HI> Chri&s;tian Forti|tude is a Vertue built upon a &s;tedfa&s;t and influential Belief of this practical Principle, that the Path of Duty is always to be pur&s;ued thro' the wor&s;t that can happen, and all Events to be left with GOD. It is the <HI>Firmne&s;s</HI> of a Mind not to be diver|ted from its Purpo&s;e by Dangers or Sufferings; but which will ri&s;k every thing that is dear in proportion to the Value of a propo&s;ed End. It is therefore as di&s;tant from that <HI>Temerity,</HI> which is &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for it, when Men hazard their Lives from fal&s;e Notions of Honour, or a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;tick Bravery, as Rea&s;on is from Madne&s;s. The &s;ame Rea&s;on which directs a Man to plunge into the mid&s;t of Dangers when called by his Duty, teacheth him too not to expo&s;e needle&s;sly a Life which is of the greate&s;t Concern to every one.</P>
<P>This Vertue is the Soldiers peculiar Glory; and the want of it utterly de&s;troys his Reputation. The World, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, &s;eems agreed to pay it the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Regards: The Recital of brave Facts fires our Minds with a Spirit &s;omething like that by which the Hero performed them; and that Hi&s;tory plea&s;eth mo&s;t which is fulle&s;t of them; while the Heart &s;ickens within at the Mention of a cowardly Action.</P>
<P>This Firmne&s;s and Intrepidity of Spirit owes much to macha|nical Principles; and in this Light is to be con&s;idered as a &s;pe|cial Gift of the GOD of Nature, re&s;ulting from a peculiar Di&s;|po&s;ition of the humane Frame, and &s;upported by outward Ac|cidents in the Cour&s;e of Providence, as Food and Exerci&s;e pro|per to that End.</P>
<P>In this Light, tho' it cannot be con&s;idered as a <HI>chri&s;tian Grace,</HI> it ought to be as a <HI>Gift of Nature</HI>; and is indeed a valuable Talent betru&s;ted with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and as &s;uch to be improved
<PB N="17" REF="005470_0015_101838725D0F3580">
to gracious Purpo&s;es, and to be accounted for in the great Day of Retribution.</P>
<P>It is a Qualification very u&s;eful to a Soldier; and, as I ap|prehend, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that, without a good Degree of it, no Man ought to chu&s;e, and devote him&s;elf to, a military Life. And for it GOD is to be prai&s;ed, as well as for the Strength and Activity of our Bodies, or the rational Endowments of our Minds; and the Soldier is to maintain it by a vertuous Life, <HI>temperate in all Things</HI>; and he that, by intemperate Practices and a &s;oft effeminate Cour&s;e of Living, de&s;troys it, is no le&s;s culpable than he that weakens his Rea&s;on with Wine.</P>
<P>But as it it a <HI>chri&s;tian Grace,</HI> it is the Re&s;ult of the Rea&s;onings of our own Minds upon the Word of Truth, the great In&s;tru|ment of Sanctification, under the Influences of the holy Spirit. It &s;prings from a Sen&s;e of our Obligations to GOD, from a Love to his Commands, from a Fear of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, from the Hopes of his Rewards, and from the Ba&s;ene&s;s of being affrighted by any Con&s;ideration what&s;oever from the Duty which we owe him.</P>
<P>It is this which di&s;tingui&s;hed the Fortitude of <HI>David</HI> from that of the Lion and the Bear. And being built upon religious Principles, like them is uniform and invariable. It is not merely a Flu&s;h of Spirits, appearing only in the Heat of Action; but is indeed mo&s;t illu&s;trious when tho&s;e Fluids are at the lowe&s;t Ebb. A Pro&s;pect of Glory may give a Spring to the Spirits, to which the Honour of a great Day may be chiefly to be a&s;cribed. But when in Adver&s;ity all Things con&s;pire to depre&s;s Nature and &s;ink the Heart, then in our Patience to po&s;&s;e&s;s our Souls, to put our Tru&s;t in GOD and hope again&s;t Hope, and betray no Meanne&s;s of Thought by any Action unworthy our Character, exhibits the Glory of Courage in the &s;tronge&s;t Light. And I add, it is remarkable that &s;ome of the greate&s;t Heroes which the World hath produced, have been formed to act with Succe&s;s and Applau&s;e, in the mo&s;t exalted Stations, by proceeding Suf|ferings. This was the Ca&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>Man of War</HI> in our Text. And thus an Hero of our own, WILLIAM the third of glorious Memory, to which we owe much of the Succe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="18" REF="005470_0016_1018387475949938">
of the Crown in the illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> by a Series of Calamities was prepared to be the Deliverer of <HI>Europe</HI> from the gra&s;ping De&s;igns of a neighbouring ambitious <HI>Monarch</HI>; and by his Pre&s;ence of Mind, the Wi&s;dom of his Conduct, and his per&s;evering Con&s;tancy in a Cour&s;e of ill Succe&s;s, had a ju&s;ter Claim to the Title of THE GREAT, than he that had it.</P>
<P>But if it be true that a State of Suffering exhibits the Grace of Fortitude in the faire&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Light, we may behold it in the highe&s;t Perfection if we look into our BIBLES, upon the Life and Death of JESUS, <HI>the Captain of our Salvation</HI>; who was <HI>a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Griefs</HI>; who&s;e Con|&s;tancy was not to be &s;haken by a Pro&s;pect of Sufferings which Language cannot de&s;cribe; but <HI>who, for the Joy that was &s;et before him, endured the Cro&s;s and de&s;pi&s;ed the Shame, and is &s;et down at the right Hand of the Throne of GOD.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.2.</NOTE> And, it is particularly to be noted, He is &s;aid to be qualified by Sufferings for the great Undertaking of leading the Sons of GOD to Glory; in Con&s;equence of which, he was him&s;elf crowned with Glory and Honour. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.10.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Clemency</HI> is to be con&s;idered as another <HI>chri&s;tian Grace,</HI> and a very u&s;eful Qualification, and great Ornament to a Soldier. It is an humane benevolent Di&s;po&s;ition towards all Men, in|clining to Kindne&s;s and Favour, where there is Room to be&s;tow them. It is the offspring of tho&s;e Commands in the Go&s;pel, <HI>Love one another, Love your Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ome Re&s;pects it hath the Advantage of Strength or For|titude. By the&s;e indeed Armies are beaten, Ca&s;tles taken, and the Bodies of Men fettered in Chains of Subjection: But Cle|mency &s;eizeth the Soul, wins over the Affections to your Side, and &s;ubjects the conquered to your Service upon Principles never to be di&s;&s;olved. It is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Spirit of the Go&s;|pel, and like it's divine Author conquers it's Oppo&s;ers by Mira|cles of Love; while Fortitude like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> effects it's De&s;igns by the Methods of De&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005470_0017_1018387615DD7D08">Great Conque&s;ts have been made by this Vertue: And in &s;earching into the Hi&s;tories of former Times to acquaint our &s;elves with the Polices of War, you will find In&s;tances of tho&s;e that, even after repeated Victories, could never compleat their Conque&s;ts but by Clemency. An Hero then &s;eems at the Top of his Wi&s;hes, when, having &s;urmounted the greate&s;t Difficul|ties, he &s;ubdues his Enemy and pardons him at his Feet. He triumphs for a double Victory gotten at the &s;ame Time, over his Enemy, and over him&s;elf. And to deny him&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of Revenge, where the Affronts received have been very great, is often the harder Ta&s;k.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> is another Grace very ornamental and beneficial to a Soldier: Criticks, as I remember, have given us this as an In&s;tance of the Sublime, <HI>I fear my GOD, I fear none but him.</HI> Sublimity in Sentiment, by being interwoven in the Habits of the Mind, and produced into Practice, forms the Hero. And it is as nece&s;&s;ary that he fear GOD as that he fear none but him. And you may ob&s;erve, they that have been &s;o de&s;ti|tute of this Principle as even to dare to a&s;pire at being deifted them&s;elves, have anon di&s;covered le&s;s of the <HI>Man,</HI> and more of the <HI>Brute</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> than the vile&s;t Part of their Fellow-Creatures; while&s;t others under the Influence of it, and parti|cularly our religious Warriour in the Text, have not only had the Applau&s;e of their own Time, which Flattery often gives, but the Prai&s;es of unprejudiced Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>This Principle, <HI>David</HI> tells us, was taught him by GOD him&s;elf. <HI>The GOD of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;aid, the Rock of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;pake to me; he that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t ruling in the Fear of GOD; And he &s;hall be as the Light of the Morning when the Sun ri&s;eth, even a Morning without Clouds; as the tender Gra&s;s &s;pring|ing out of the Earth by clear Shining after the Rain.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 23.3.4.</NOTE> And under the Influences of it you find him in all Circum&s;tances. If he enterpri&s;eth a great Action, it is in the Fear of GOD; if he comes off with Victory and Honour, &s;till it is in the Fear of GOD and his Goodne&s;s; or if he fall into Adver&s;ity, the Fear of GOD occa&s;ions Self Examination, Humiliation and Repen|tance,

and opens a Door of Hope in the GOD of his Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Loyalty</HI> is a very nece&s;&s;ary Vertue in a Soldier. Subjec|tion to the higher Powers is an <HI>apo&s;tolick</HI> Precept, and binds the Soldier's Con&s;cience. The &s;ame Text that bids us <HI>Fear GOD</HI> adds <HI>honour the King.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.17.</NOTE> He then that rebels again&s;t his Sovereign, that un&s;heathes the Sword which he put into his Hands, and turns the Point again&s;t him, tho' upon the loude&s;t Calls of PRIVATE Intere&s;t or Revenge, breaks the &s;tronge&s;t Ties of Con&s;cience and Chri&s;tianity. And if the Degrees of moral Vertue are to be e&s;timated by the good or Mi&s;chief they do in the World, Di&s;loyalty in a Soldier mu&s;t be accounted a Sin of the fir&s;t Magnitude. This is the Root of that ju&s;tly dreaded Evil, a civil War. And if the Connection between them were &s;hewn, and the con&s;equent Tragedies and continual Horrors de&s;cribed without any Exaggrevation, no Man of any Con&s;ideration but would tremble to remember he had ever entertained a di&s;loyal Tho't in his Heart.</P>
<P>Often there is in Di&s;loyalty &s;uch Ingratitude as is utterly in|con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>true Honour.</HI> The rebellious Soldier is one that hath lived upon his Sovereign's Bread and worn his Honours; and therefore, barely from the Ingratitude of his Actions, if he had lived at <HI>Athens,</HI> he would, by the Law of the Land, have been reduced to the ignominious State of a Slave; or among&s;t the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> puni&s;hed with Death.</P>
<P>Nor let it be imagined, there is any Thing criminal in the Life and Character of <HI>David</HI> upon this Head. It is true, the injurious Treatment of his Prince, and his De&s;ign upon his Life drove him into the Wilderne&s;s for his Security. But notwith|&s;tanding all the Wrongs he had to complain of in the deare&s;t concerns, and the continual Danger of Death in which he lived, he never enterprized any Thing again&s;t his Crown or Life; but generou&s;ly diverted the Purpo&s;e of another again&s;t the latter, choo&s;ing rather to leave the Redre&s;s of his Wrongs to that GOD, at who&s;e Tribunal all the Kings of the Earth mu&s;t appear like common Men, than to make him&s;elf a Judge and Revenger in

<P N="5">5. The <HI>Love of One's Country</HI> is another Vertue well becom|ing a <HI>Soldier.</HI> Every Member of the Body politick hath a proper Office a&s;&s;igned it; and the meaner ones are not without their U&s;efulne&s;s. <HI>The Eye cannot &s;ay to the Head, I have no need of thee</HI>; nor again, <HI>the Hand to the Foot, I have no need of you.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 12.21.</NOTE> While the Merchant and the Hu&s;bandman &s;upply the Soldier with foreign or dome&s;tic Provi&s;ions, for the Support and Com|fort of his Life, he, in his Turn, &s;ecures them in their Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, by his military Skill and Courage. <HI>The whole Body fitly joined together, is compacted by that which every Joint &s;upplieth</HI>; and every Part, exerting its proper Influence, <HI>makes an Increa&s;e of the Body,</HI> building it &s;elf up in the mutual Love and Care of all the Members. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4.16.</NOTE> Love is the Union of the whole Body, directing its various Powers to the &s;ame End. All the Endea|vours of the Community to promote its own Welfare, take their Ri&s;e from the Love of one's Country, as Self-Love in every Man is the Principle of Self-Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>It is therefore no le&s;s ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous, for a Man to entertain a Spirit of Enmity again&s;t his Country, than to be a Self-Hater. And for a Soldier to employ his military Powers to oppre&s;s and ruin his Country, is for one Hand to cut off the other, and then de&s;troy the whole Body.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="005470_0020_10183881834B52A0">The &s;acred Scriptures give us many noble In&s;tances of this Pa&s;&s;ion.

<P>It was a Love to their Country, a mighty Affection to the happy Privileges which GOD had given them, that &s;pirited ma|ny of the Captivity to leave the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which they had gained in foreign Lands, and return thro' very great Di&s;cou|ragements, to the Land of their Fore-fathers Nativity; whil&s;t many others of le&s;s Courage, or more Love to their worldly Acqui&s;itions, contented them&s;elves to enjoy their religious Privileges in the be&s;t Manner they could among&s;t the Heathen. But in none doth this Grace appear with greater Advantage, than in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> tho' born and educated in a &s;trange Land. The great Honour he had in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Court might have prevail'd with another to have neglected the ruinous State of his Country, and the Wall of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;till broken down in many Places, and con&s;equently expo&s;ed continually to the In|roads and In&s;ults of their Enemies. But the U&s;e he made of it was to &s;ecure the Favour of the Monarch for his People, and to be &s;ent into <HI>Judea,</HI> with a Commi&s;&s;ion to rebuild the Walls and Gates of that City. A great Example this, and what de|&s;erves often to be tho't upon by a religious Soldier, that he pre&s;erve in him&s;elf a Love to his Country, and an Affection to its Privileges, civil and religious. For no Men are more likely to be a Ble&s;&s;ing to their People, by pre&s;erving and de|fending them, or a Bla&s;t, by de&s;erting and de&s;troying them: In their Hand is the Sword to pre&s;erve or de&s;troy.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Obedience to Superiours,</HI> is another Vertue very nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>Soldiers.</HI> This is a Duty of great Importance to the Com|munity;
<PB N="23" REF="005470_0021_101810A4089697D8">
and the Neglect of it is the Inlet to Anarchy and Confu&s;ion. No State, no Church can &s;ub&s;i&s;t long without it; and the Succe&s;s of our Arms is nece&s;&s;arily connected with it.</P>
<P>If every private Soldier was fir&s;t to be &s;atisfied of the Wi&s;dom of his Officer's Command before he moved, he would often be rea&s;oning when he &s;hould be fighting; and in the mean Time Opportunities would be lo&s;t, which could no more be recalled than the Moment in which they pre&s;ented them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Neither are the greate&s;t Dangers to be regarded, in Oppo|&s;ition to a Superiour's Command. When the religious Soldier fir&s;t entred upon his Calling, he devoted his Life to the Service of his GOD, his King and Country. To ri&s;k it then, when commanded, is the very Thing he came out for: <HI>Duty</HI> is to be con&s;idered and not <HI>Danger.</HI> If he returns, he comes back with Honour and Satisfaction, and &s;tands fair for Preferment: If he falls, he dies greatly, and in a Manner not unde&s;ireable; and <HI>his Memory &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> He dies in the Bed of true Honour, which is better than that of a Fever.</P>
<P>And as a mo&s;t ready and &s;trenuous Obedience is of the great|e&s;t Importance in the Time of Action, it is al&s;o of great Ne|ce&s;&s;ity in the Time of In&s;truction. I am &s;orry there is any rea&s;on to complain, the little Re&s;pect, which is paid to Officers in &s;ome Country Towns in the Di&s;charge of their Duty, is to be a&s;&s;igned as one Rea&s;on of the little Proficiency made by military Exerci&s;es. Whether this Fault be &s;o general as to have been ob&s;erved by tho&s;e that have gone before me, I know not. But that it is common enough to ju&s;tify this Remark, I make no Doubt. And I am per&s;uaded the great Liberty of Speech which Soldiers take in the Field before their Officers, and even in the Time of Exerci&s;e, &s;ometimes in an unmannerly good Humour, at other Times in angry Re&s;entment, is an Evil that needs greatly to be reformed. And it becomes them to be &s;ubject, if <HI>not for Wrath,</HI> yet, <HI>for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> And this minds me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="7">7. La&s;tly, A <HI>teachable Spirit</HI> is a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification in a Soldier. It is &s;o in acquiring Knowledge and Skill in any Art; and no Man can expect to excell in military Skill without it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005470_0022_1018388A23CFB1B0">In&s;tead therefore of bringing to military exerci&s;es an idle, carele&s;s, or ludicrous Spirit, they &s;hould be attended with a De&s;ire and De&s;ign to learn the Duty of a Soldier, and become expert in the Handling of Arms. He that is convinced that this Kind of Skill is nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h him for the Defence of his Country, ought to account the Time of military Exerci&s;es too precious to be trifled away. And I am per&s;uaded, if Sol|diers came to them with an Appetite to the Skill that is to be acquired by them, and a con&s;cientious Di&s;po&s;ition to make the be&s;t Improvement of them for that End, few as they are, they would be greatly &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>But as few if any Arts are arrived at &s;uch Perfection as to be uncapable of receiving Improvement from the ingenious and indu&s;trious, a Genius will not content it &s;elf to learn only what hath been taught before; but will be ambitious of adorning his Art with new Additions of Knowledge, or a better manner of performing it. Soldiers, I pre&s;ume, are not &s;ubject to a Spirit of Bigotry; and if any new Methods &s;hould be found out more beautiful and expeditious than what had been in u&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e a Fondne&s;s for old Practices would hardly prevent their being laid a&s;ide for new that are better. <HI>Uzziah</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> a Prince of a warlike Genius, is mentioned with Honour in the &s;acred Scriptures for the great Improvements he made in the <HI>Art of War.</HI> You read, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 26.14, 15.</NOTE> <HI>He prepared for them thro' out all the Ho&s;t Shields, and Spears, and Helmets, and Habergeons, and Bows, and Slings to ca&s;t Stones.

<P>Let me now inforce what I have been &s;aying to Men of the MILITARY ORDER, and then I &s;hall conclude.</P>
<P>There are two Things which it hath been my De&s;ign to re|commend in this Di&s;cour&s;e. One is, a religious Dedication of
<PB N="26" REF="005470_0024_1018388EED8605B0">
our &s;elves to GOD, made with the utmo&s;t Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Sin|cerity, ari&s;ing from a real and influential Conviction of the Truths of the Go&s;pel, made in our Minds by the Word and Spirit of GOD. And the other is, the Con&s;ideration and Im|provement of tho&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tian Graces,</HI> which will be the peculiar Ornament of a <HI>Chri&s;tian Soldier.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t is certainly of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to the Man, who&s;e Calling it is to hazard his Life for his King and Country. If to die well be of infinitely the greate&s;t Concern to every Man, it e&s;pecially becomes tho&s;e to be prepared for Death, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s in Life lies upon the very Margin of the Grave. The Uncertainty of Death, how little &s;oever it is heeded, is an un|an&s;werable Argument with every one to a &s;peedy Repentance; but it &s;trengthens with every Man in Proportion to the peculiar Hazard his Life is incident to.</P>
<P>It is not, my Brethren, a <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity</HI> by Bap|ti&s;m, or any other Ordinance; it is not a mere <HI>Form of Godli|ne&s;s,</HI> and a <HI>Name to live,</HI> while in Heart and Life we are dead to the Belief and Practice of the Go&s;pel, which I am now re|commending: But an Apprehen&s;ion of the Importance of &s;pi|ritual and everla&s;ting Things, and an Heart formed to all the vertuous Purpo&s;es of the <HI>chri&s;tian Life,</HI> with a ju&s;t Abhor|rence of all Sin, and an an&s;werably vertuous and heavenly Life and Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>This only can make Death &s;afe, and ju&s;tify any Man in devoting him&s;elf to a Life of Dangers. By this, that <HI>Fortitude of Spirit,</HI> which is a <HI>chri&s;tian Vertue,</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> of him, that, tho'tle&s;s of the future, ru&s;heth like the Hor&s;e into the Battle. And without this, <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> the ge|nuine Parent of true Courage, would only &s;erve to beget in Men, Terrors that would utterly unfit them for Action. For, I make no Doubt, the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, believ'd, but not obey'd, would di&s;hearten the Soldier in the Day of Battle, (if he had any ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of his guilty Condition) and give the heathen Stranger to the Doctrines of everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery in the future World, a great Advantage over him. And finally, by this the Favour of GOD is &s;ecured, who <HI>covereth the Head in

<P>Such Con&s;iderations as the&s;e, were they duly entertained, would have a peculiar Influence upon every Man that &s;u&s;tains a military Character.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, you have heard, it is incumbent upon the religious Soldier, to maintain and cheri&s;h in him&s;elf, the par|ticular Graces of the chri&s;tian Life, as the peculiar Accom|pli&s;hment and Ornament of a military Man. Every Soldier, examining him&s;elf, &s;hould make an E&s;timate, in part, of his Qualifications for a military Life, by the Strength of &s;uch gra|cious Habits within him, and the Con&s;tancy and Uniformity of their Operations in his Life. And in accompli&s;hing him&s;elf for his Calling, while, with much Pains and Diligence in <HI>mili|tary Exerci&s;es,</HI> he perfects him&s;elf in the <HI>Art of War,</HI> let him by no Means forget to improve him&s;elf by <HI>moral ones,</HI> &s;o very nece&s;&s;ary to fini&s;h his Character as a Soldier. This Kind of military Vertue is gained, maintained, and improved by <HI>Exer|ci&s;e</HI> as well as the other.</P>
<P>By frequent Meditation therefore upon the Nature and Tendency of the &s;everal Graces of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> let him acquaint him&s;elf with the Excellency of that, the <HI>Merchandi&s;e of which is better than the Merchandi&s;e of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold; which is more precious than Rubies, and not to be equalled by all the Things that thou can'&s;t de&s;ire.</HI> By Prayer let him engage the &s;anctifying Influences of the holy Spirit, pro|mi&s;ed to them that a&s;k him of GOD their heavenly Father; and by continual Practice and Watchfulne&s;s, let every Call of Corruption be con&s;tantly denied, and every gracious Di&s;po&s;i|tion exerted, in common Life, as there &s;hall be Occa&s;ion. Let him remember, <HI>He that is &s;low to Anger is better than the Mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</HI> Thus, by the daily Repetition of gracious Actions, let him &s;trengthen the Habits of them within him&s;elf, and improve in the holy Art of living to GOD; that his Heart being e&s;tabli&s;hed in Grace, he may know the U&s;efulne&s;s of it in his military Calling.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005470_0026_10183895D16260E0">But it is now Time to come to a Conclu&s;ion, and I &s;hall do it with an Addre&s;s to the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that have called me to the Service this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>I con&s;ider the ancient and honourable Artillery-Company, as a School of military In&s;truction, diffu&s;ing its Influences into the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts of the Province. By your Exerci&s;es it is, that &s;ome of our mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Soldiers have acquired their excelling Skill in the&s;e Matters, whereby they have been able to in&s;truct others. The U&s;efulne&s;s of your Exerci&s;es, and military Accompli&s;hments, is not confined within your&s;elves, but is very exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration, therefore, ought to fix your Aims, and quicken your Endeavours after the highe&s;t Degrees of Perfection in military Vertue. The Pro&s;pect of U&s;eful|ne&s;s is your Argument, and the more Good you have it in your Power to do, the &s;tronger it is. This is your End, whether you read in the Study, or practice in the Field; whether you &s;earch into the Rea&s;ons of ancient Cu&s;toms, or the Practice of the pre&s;ent Day; whether you record, from the Hi&s;tories of former Times for future U&s;e, the Stratagems of War, the Policy of which plea&s;eth you be&s;t; or the heroic Sentiments of &s;ome great Captain that &s;trike you mo&s;t, or any divine Reflections of &s;ingular Influence upon your military Life. Your End in all the&s;e Things is the Glory of GOD, and the Service of your King and Country. What Care and Pains then become you to ex|cell in every illu&s;trious Accompli&s;hment of the Soldier, that by the Force of your In&s;tructions and reputable Exam|ample, others may learn of you the &s;ublimer as well as the more common ones?</P>
<P>If there be any Time, which, more than other, re|quires the Accompli&s;hment of a Soldier, in Perfection, it is now. GOD, who hath been lifting up an En&s;ign to the Nations, and as a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment to an ungodly World, &s;uffered the Lu&s;ts of Men to break forth into Wars and
<PB N="29" REF="005470_0027_10183897B2A04808">
Fightings, hath, the other Day, cau&s;ed the Alarm of War to be &s;ounded in our Ears al&s;o. On one Side, we are in Fears from the Inva&s;ions of exa&s;perated Powers from afar; and on the other, from the Sword of the Wilderne&s;s in the Hands of bloody Men, <HI>who&s;e tender Mercies are Cruelties.</HI> We have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us, what bloody Tragedies have been acted upon the Stage of <HI>New-England</HI> in their Day; &s;uch as, in the Relation, might &s;eem rather the Work of Fancy than of a faithful Hi&s;torian. And to render our Pro&s;pects the more di&s;mal, what Grounds have we to fear our Wickedne&s;s hath made us ripe for the Judgments of an incen&s;ed GOD, and to have the &s;ame things acted over again?</P>
<P>It is now no Time for Soldiers to content them&s;elves with &s;howy Exerci&s;es and &s;plendid Appearances, which like the Lilly, bloom and wither in a Day. The Defence of your Country calls you into the Field, not of Exerci&s;e, but of Battle. You are to handle your Arms in good earne&s;t, and <HI>not as one that beats the Air</HI>: You are not now to fence for Exerci&s;e or O&s;ten|tation, but to defend your &s;elves; and what is more your Coun|try, and drive away the Enemy from the Gates.</P>
<P>It is high Time therefore that, being the Subjects of Grace and Sanctification, you live in the daily Exerci&s;e of every <HI>Chri&s;t|ian Vertue</HI>; and by &s;uch a Life, accompanied with a careful Self Examination, you had made your <HI>Calling and Election &s;ure</HI>; and were able to think with Calmne&s;s and Indifference upon that which is &s;o much the dread of all Men, and <HI>thro' Fear</HI> of which &s;o many are <HI>all their Life Time &s;ubject to Bondage.</HI> Sin unrepented of, and unfor&s;aken, is a Thing mo&s;t de&s;tructive to true Valour, and will be the wor&s;t Enemy in the Day of Battle. And he that is under the Influence of it may well dread Death; and is prepared to run away to his everla&s;tidg Infamy, which would be wor&s;e than Death, were it not for what is to follow. <HI>The Wicked flee when no Man pur&s;ueth, but the Righteous are bold as a Lion.</HI></P>
<P>But on the other Hand, having &s;ecured the Salvation of your Souls, thro' the Merits of the REDEEMER, you may not only
<PB N="30" REF="005470_0028_1018389A02A56DE0">
be fearle&s;s and undaunted at all the hideous Forms that Death can wear, but even wi&s;h to die in the Defence of your Country, the greate&s;t Honour any Man can a&s;pire to next to, that of dying for the Honour of CHRIST, who fir&s;t died for him; and, what is infinitely more, may be calm as your own Con&s;ciences in that univer&s;al Ruin, when <HI>the Heavens &s;hall be on Fire, and the Ele|ments &s;hall melt with fervent Heat, and the World and the Works of it &s;hall be burnt up.</HI> I will conclude all, addre&s;&s;ing the follow|ing Words of the &s;ame <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> to this whole A&s;&s;embly. 2 Pet. 3.11. <HI>Seeing then that all the&s;e Things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, what manner of Per&s;ons ought ye to be in all holy Conver&s;ation and God|line&s;s?</HI></P>
