<HEAD>On the Reality, Beauty Importance, and Nece&s;&s;ity of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>A Few days after the archbi&s;hop of Paris and his vicars had &s;et the example of renouncing their clerical character, a rector, from a village on the banks of the Rhone, followed by &s;ome of his pari&s;hioners, with an of|fering of gold and &s;ilver &s;aints, chali|ces, rich ve&s;tments, &amp;c. pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the bar of the convention.</P>
<P>The rector, a thin venerable man, with grey hairs, was ordered to &s;peak.</P>
<P>I come, &s;aid he, from the village of ******, where the only good build|ing &s;tanding is a very fine church.&mdash;My pari&s;hioners beg you will take it, to make an ho&s;pital for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ick and

wounded of both parties, they being both equally our countrymen. The gold and &s;ilver part of which we have brought to you, they intreat you will devote to the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, and that you will ca&s;t the bells into cannon to drive its foreign invaders. For my&s;elf, I am come, with great plea&s;-u&s;e to re&s;ign my letters of ordination, of induction, and every deed and ti|tle by which I have been con&s;tituted a member of your eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity. Here are the papers; you may burn them if you plea&s;e, in the &s;ame fire with the genealogical trees and patents of nobility. I de&s;ire, likewi&s;e, that you will di&s;continue my &s;alary. I am &s;till able to &s;upport my&s;elf by the labour of my hands; and I beg you to believe that I never felt &s;incerer joy than I now do in making this renuncia|tion. I have longed to &s;ee this day; I &s;ee it, and am glad.</P>
<P>When the old man had done &s;peak|ing, the applau&s;es were immoderate. The rector did not &s;eem greatly elated with tho&s;e tokens of approbation; he retired back a few &s;teps, and thus re|&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

Before you applaud my &s;entiments, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> you &s;hould under&s;tand them; perhaps they may not entirely coin|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> with your own. I rejoice in this day not becau&s;e I wi&s;h to &s;ee religion degraded, but, becau&s;e I wi&s;h to &s;ee it exalted and purified.</P>
<P>By di&s;&s;olving its alliance with the &s;tate, you have given it dignity and inde|pendence. You have done it a piece of &s;ervice&mdash;a service which its well|wi&s;hers would perhaps never have had courage to render it, but which is the only thing it wanted to make it appear in its genuine beauty and lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Nobody will now &s;ay of me, when I am performing the offices of my religion, it is a trade; he is paid for telling the people &s;uch and &s;uch things; he is hired to keep up a u&s;eful piece of mum|mery. They cannot now &s;ay this,? and therefore I feel my&s;elf rai&s;ed in my own e&s;teem, and &s;hall &s;peak to them with a confidence and frankne&s;s, which, before this, I never dur&s;t ven|ture to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>We re&s;ign without reluctance our gold and &s;ilver images and embroider|ed ve&s;tments, because we have never

found that looking upon gold and &s;il|ver made the heart more pure, or the affections more heavenly; we can al&s;o &s;pare our churches, for the heart that wi&s;hes to li&s;t it&s;elf up to God will never be at a lo&s;s for a place to do it in; but we cannot &s;pare religion, be|cau&s;e, to tell you the truth, we never had to much occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand that you accu&s;e us prie&s;ts of having told the people a great many fal&s;ehoods. I &s;u&s;pect this may have been the care, but till this day we have never been allowed to en|quire whether the things which we taught them were true or not. I cannot but hope, however, that the errors we have fallen into have not been very material, &s;ince the village has in general been &s;ober and good; the pea&s;ants are hone&s;t, docile, and laborious; the hu&s;bands love their wives, and the wives their hu&s;bands; they are fortunately not too rich to be compa&s;&s;ionate, and they have con|&s;tantly relieved the &s;ick and fugitives of all parties whenever it has been in their way. I think, therefore, what I have taught them cannot be &s;o very ami&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030546_0007_0FE7BA98F89BE5C8">
You want to extirpate prie&s;ts, but will you hinder the ignorant from ap|plying for in&s;truction, the unhappy for comfort and hope, the unlearned from looking up to the learned? If you do not, you will have prie&s;ts, by whatever name you may order them to be called; but it is certainly not ne|ce&s;&s;ary they &s;hould wear a particular dre&s;s, or be appointed by &s;tate letters of ordination. My letters of ordina|tion are my zeal, my charity, my ar|dent love for my dear children of the village: If I were more learned I would add my knowledge, but alas! we all know very little; to a man ev|ery error is pardonable but want of hu|mility. We have a public walk, with a &s;preading elm-tree at one end of it, and a circle of green round it, with a convenient bench. Here I &s;hall draw together the children as they are playing around me. I &s;hall point to the vines laden with fruit, to the orchards, to the herds of cattle lowing around us, to the di&s;tant hills &s;tretch|ing one behind another, and they will a&s;k me, how came all the&s;e things? I &s;hall tell them all I know, or all that
<PB N="14" REF="030546_0008_0FE7BA9C176C8560">
I have heard from the wi&s;e men who have lived before me; they will be penetrated with love and veneration; they will kneel and I &s;hall kneel with them; they will not be at my feet, but all of us at the feet of that Good Be|ing whom we &s;hall wor&s;hip together, and thus they will receive into their render minds a religion.</P>
<P>The old men will &s;ometimes come, from having depo&s;ited under the green &s;od one of their companions, and place them&s;elves by my &s;ide. They will look wi&s;hfully at the turf, and anxiou&s;ly enquire is he gone forever? &s;hall we &s;oon be like him? will no morning break over the tomb? when the wicked cea&s;e from troubling will the good cea&s;e from doing good? We will talk of the&s;e things, I will com|fort them.&mdash;I will tell them of the goodne&s;s of God, I will &s;peak to them of a life to come; I will bid them hope for a &s;tate of retribution.</P>
<P>You have changed our holydays;&mdash;you have an undoubted right, as our civil governors &s;o to do; it is very im|material whether they are kept once in &s;even days or once in ten: &s;ome,
<PB N="15" REF="030546_0009_0FE7BA9D21B929D8">
however, you leave us, and when they occur, I &s;hall tell tho&s;e who chu&s;e to hear me, of the beauty and utility of virtue, of the dignity of right conduct.</P>
<P>There is a book out of which I have &s;ometimes taught my people; It &s;ays, we are to love tho&s;e who do us hurt, and to pour oil and wine into the wounds of the &s;tranger. In this book we read of a per&s;on called Je&s;us;&mdash;&s;ome wor&s;hip him as God: others, as I am told, &s;ay it is wrong &s;o to do:&mdash;&s;ome teach that he exi&s;ted before the beginning of ages, others, that he was born of Jo&s;eph and Mary.</P>
<P>I cannot tell whether the&s;e contro|ver&s;ies will be ever decided; but in the mean time, I think we cannot do otherwi&s;e than well in imitating him, for I learn that he loved the poor, and went about doing good.</P>

<HEAD>THE NEGRO</HEAD>
<P>"Alas I am &s;aint and feeble," &s;aid a voice which mi&s;ery &s;eemed to have rendered almo&s;t inarticulate. They were the words of a poor negro, who, oppre&s;&s;ed by the heat of the &s;un, (for
<PB N="16" REF="030546_0010_0FE7BAA039D73488">
the day was hot and &s;ultry) in a lan|guid po&s;ture, was enjoying a &s;hort re&s;|pite from his labors. "Cur&s;e on Eu|ropean avarice that deals in cargoes of wretchedne&s;s, and thrives by the traffic of de&s;pair," I exclaimed the very mo|ment my imagination caught the picture. "Perhaps," &s;aid I, "this child of &s;orrow has been torn from a father&mdash;a mother." Nature mu&s;t have pleaded very loudly again&s;t his captivity; for I thought I could perceive the tears of affection &s;tanding in his eyes, "Or, perhaps, he has looked forward, with eager expectation, to the days he &s;eemed de&s;tined to pa&s;s with the com|panion of his youth; and now"&mdash;I thought on thee, Eliza, the partner of my life, and I endeavored to di|vert my thought from the gloomy read they were pur&s;uing; but in vain. My captive &s;poke &s;till louder.</P>
<P>"I once was happy," &s;aid he, "When I lived beyond the&s;e great waters, I heard not the yells of de&s;|pair; the gale rung not with the &s;hrieks of the wretched. Our but was in a cool valley, beneath the &s;hade of the lo&s;ty palm trees. My labours

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Oriental TALE.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Ortogrul of Ba&s;ia was one day wandering along the &s;treets of Bag|dat, mu&s;ing on the varieties of merchan|dize which the &s;hops offered to his view, and ob&s;erving the different occupations which bu&s;ied the multitudes on every &s;ide, he was awakened from the tranquility of meditation by a crowd that ob&s;tructed his pa&s;&s;age. He rai&s;ed his eyes and &s;aw the chief vizier who had returned from the di|van, and was entering his palace. Orto|grul mingled with the attendants, and being &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s for the vi&s;ier was permited to enter. He &s;urveyed the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the apartments, admired the walls hung with golden tape&s;try, and the floors covered with &s;ilken carpets, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;imple neatne&s;s of his own little habitation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Surely &s;aid he to him&s;elf this palace is the &s;eat of happine&s;s, where plea&s;ure &s;uc|ceeds to plea&s;ure, and di&s;content and &s;orrow can have no admi&s;&s;ion. Whatever nature has provided for the delight of &s;en&s;e is here &s;pread forth to be enjoyed,
<PB N="20" REF="030546_0014_0FE7BAA88FE6A208">
what can mortal wi&s;h or imagine which the ma&s;ter of this palace has not obtained? The di&s;hes of luxury cover his table, the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers: he breathes the fragrance of the groves of java, and &s;leeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges. He &s;peaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he wi&s;hes and his wi&s;h is gratified; all whom he &s;ees obey him, all whom he hears flatters him. How different, Ortogrul is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torment of un&s;atisfied de&s;ire, and who ha&s;t no amu&s;e|ment in thy power that can withhold thee from thy own conviction. They tell thee that thou art wi&s;e, but what does wi&s;dom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor, and the wi&s;e have very little power of flattering them&s;elves. That man is &s;urely the mo&s;t wretched of the &s;ons of wretchedne&s;s who lives with his own faults and follies always before him, and who has none to reconcile him to him&s;elf by prai&s;e and veneration. I have long &s;ought content and have not found it; I will from this moment endeavour to be rich.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Full of his new re&s;olution, he &s;hut him&s;elf in his chamber for &s;ix months, to deliberate how he &s;hould grow rich: he &s;ometimes propo&s;ed to offer him&s;elf as

coun&s;ellor to one of the kings of India, and &s;ometimes re&s;olved to dig for diamonds in the mines of Golconda. One day after &s;ome hours pa&s;&s;ed in violent fluctuation of opinion, &s;leep in&s;en&s;ibly &s;eized him in his chair: he dreamed that he was ranging a de&s;art country in &s;earch of &s;ome one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he &s;tood on a hill &s;haded with cypre&s;s, in doubt whither to direct his &s;teps, his father appeared on a &s;udden, &s;tanding before him. Ortogrul, &s;aid the old man, I know thy perplexity, li&s;ten to thy father. Ca&s;t thine eye on the oppo&s;ite mountain. Orto|grul looked and &s;aw a torrent tumbling down the rocks roaring with the noi&s;e of thunder, and &s;cattering its foam on the impending woods. Now, &s;aid his father, look upon the valley that lies between the hills. Ortogrul looked, and e&s;pied a well out of which i&s;&s;ued a &s;mall rivulet. Tell me now, &s;aid his father, do&s;t thou wi&s;h for &s;udden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent, or for a &s;low and gradual increa&s;e, re&s;embling the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill gliding from the well.

dry and du&s;ty, but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake which the &s;upply, &s;low and con&s;tant, kept always full. He waked and determined to grow rich by &s;ilent pro&s;us and indu&s;try.</HI></P>

<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> M. FLORIAN.</BYLINE>
<P>IF, as the Per&s;ians a&s;&s;ert, we might believe that the univer&s;e is in &s;ubjec|tion to two principles, of which one does the little good which is con&s;pi|cious, and the other the evil every where &s;o abundant, we would be inclined to believe that Africa is the place where the evil principle, in a particular man|ner, exerci&s;es his power. No portion of the globe produces &s;uch variety of poi&s;ons, &s;o many wild bea&s;ts and veno|mous reptiles. The little which we know of the hi&s;tory of Morocco, of the Negroes of Adra, of Jaggas, the native inhabitants of the coa&s;ts, as far as the country of the Hottentots, bears a remarkable re&s;emblance to the natural hi&s;tory of lions, panthers, and &s;erpents, which are &s;o worthy of partaking this parching region with the&s;e cannibal Princes which &s;ell and eat the fle&s;h of their pri&s;oners. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;gu&s;ting and horrible &s;cenes, where
<PB N="24" REF="030546_0018_0FE7BAB189CCB290">
&s;ome &s;ell their children, and others eat their captives, we &s;ometimes, may di&s;|cover traces of natural ju&s;tice, of gen|uine virtue, of con&s;tancy in &s;uffering, and a generous, contempt of death. The&s;e examples, rare as they may be are &s;ufficient to intere&s;t us in this de|graded part of the human &s;pecies, to make us remember that they &s;till are men: ju&s;t as in a barren de&s;art, a few &s;olitary blades of verdure, which the traveller is from time to time delighted to di&s;cover, &s;uffice to convince him that he &s;till treads upon the earth.</P>
<P>IN the kingdom of Juida, &s;ituated on the coa&s;t of Guinea, beyond the Cape of three points, and not far from Sabi, its capital, there lived, in the year 1727, a poor widow, named Darina; &s;he was the mother of three &s;ons, whom &s;he had brought up with a tenderne&s;s fortunately common in human nature, but very uncommon in the climates where children are con&s;idered as an ar|ticle of trade, and &s;old for &s;laves by their unfeeling parents. The olde&s;t of the&s;e were called Guberi; the &s;econd Teloa; and the younge&s;t Selico. All of the&s;e were amiable and &s;en&s;ible; they adored their good mother, who, now
<PB N="25" REF="030546_0019_0FE7BAB3142EB7B0">
grown old and infirm, lived only by their indu&s;try. The wealth of this fam|ily con&s;i&s;ted only of a hut, in which they lived together, with a little field contiguous, the maize of which was their &s;upport. Every morning, taking it by turns, one of the three brothers went to the chace, another worked in the field, the third remained at home with their mother: in the evening they met, the hunt&s;man produced his par|triges, parrot, or perhaps a little ho|ney; the hu&s;bandman brought fuel, whil&s;t he who &s;tayed at home provided their common meat. They &s;upped af|fectionately together, contending who &s;hould be mo&s;t attentive to their mother: they received her ble&s;&s;ing, and reclin|ing upon &s;traw, by the &s;ide of each other, they went to &s;leep expecting the morrow.</P>
<P>SELICO, the younge&s;t of the breth|ren, went often to the town to carry the fir&s;t fruits of the harve&s;t, the offering of this poor family, to the temple of the great divinity of their country. This god, it is well known, is a huge &s;erpent of that &s;pecies which are not venomous and do no injury; on the contrary, they de&s;troy tho&s;e &s;erpents
<PB N="26" REF="030546_0020_0FE7BAB6DA463A10">
which are venomous; and they are &s;o venerated at Juida, that it is con&s;idered as a horrible crime to put one to death. Thus the number of the&s;e &s;acred &s;er|pents has multiplied without end, in the mid&s;t of their towns and villages, and, even within hou&s;es, one meets, at eve|ry &s;tep, the&s;e deities, who come fa|miliarly to feel at the tables of their wor&s;hippers, &s;leeping near their fires, and producing their young upon their beds; which la&s;t is con&s;idered by them at the happie&s;t of omens.</P>
<P>OF all the Negroes of Juida, Selico was the blacke&s;t, the be&s;t made, and the mo&s;t amiable. In the temple of their great deity he had &s;een the young Be|ri&s;&s;a, daughter to the Chief Prie&s;t, who, by her figure, her beauty, and her grace, was far &s;uperior to all her companions. Selico conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for her, and was beloved in return. Every Friday, the day &s;acred among&s;t the Negroes to repo&s;e and religion, the young lover ap|peared at the temple, pa&s;&s;ed the day in the &s;ociety of his dear Beri&s;&s;a, told her of his mother, his tender pa&s;&s;ion, and of the happine&s;s they &s;hould enjoy when united in marriage. Beri&s;&s;a did not appear to conceal that &s;he equally
<PB N="27" REF="030546_0021_0FE7BAB80D1C9528">
de&s;ired this moment to arrive; and the venerable Farulho, her father, who approved of the connection, promi&s;ed, with embraces, &s;oon to reward their tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>AT length this period, &s;o anxiou&s;ly expected, drew nigh.&mdash;The day was fixed; the mother of Selico and the two brothers had made ready the hut for the young couple, when the famous Truro Audati, King of Dahomai, who&s;e rapid victories have been celebrated even in Europe, invading the kingdom of Ar|dra, exterminating the inhabitants, and advancing at the head of his formidable army, was checked only by the great river which bounded the realms of the &s;overeign of Juida. This la&s;t a week and timid Prince, governed by his wo|men and his mini&s;ters, did not think even of collecting a few troops to op|po&s;e the conqueror. He believed that the deities of the country knew well enough how to defend the entrance, and carried to the banks of the river all the &s;acred &s;erpents that could be got toge|ther. The Prince of Dahomai, &s;urpri&s;ed and indignant at having only reptiles to combat, threw him&s;elf into the &s;tream with his troops, and gained the oppo&s;ite

bank, and very &s;oon the&s;e gods, from whom miracles were expected, were cut to pieces, roa&s;ted on the fire, and de|voured by the conquerors. Then the King of Juida, thinking that nothing el&s;e could &s;ave him, abandoned his ca|pital, and ha&s;tened to conceal him&s;elf in a remote i&s;land. The warriors of Au|dati &s;pread them&s;elves every where, carrying with them fire and &s;word.&mdash;They burned the crops, towns, and vil|lages, and ma&s;&s;acred without mercy all that they could find.</P>
<P>TERROR di&s;per&s;ed the few inhabit|ants who e&s;caped the carnage. The three brothers, on the approach of the conquerors, had taken their mother on their &s;houlders and ha&s;tened to conceal them&s;elves in the woods. Selico would not leave Darina whil&s;t &s;he was expo&s;ed to the &s;malle&s;t danger; but the moment he &s;aw her in &s;afety, trembling for the fate of Beri&s;&s;a, he flew to Sabi, to &s;ave or peri&s;h with her. Sabi was ta|ken by the Dahomians. The &s;treets flowed with blood! the hou&s;es were plundered and de&s;troyed; the palace of the King and the temple of the &s;erpent were nothing but &s;moaking ruins, cov|ered with dead bodies, who&s;e heads, ac|cording

<P>AFTER dedicating five days to this terrible &s;earch, doubting not but that Beri&s;&s;a and her father had become the victims of the ferocious Dahomians, Selico determined to return to his mo|ther. He found her in the wood where he had left her with his brothers. The fixed &s;orrow of Selico, his manner, and his wild looks, terrified this unhappy fa|mily! Darina lamented his misfortune, and tried various con&s;olations; to all of which her &s;on was in&s;en&s;ible. He refu|&s;ed all nouri&s;hment, and &s;eemed deter|mined to expire by famine.

They demanded of him. <Q>whether at that &s;ight he had not the courage to live?</Q></P>
<P>SELICO promi&s;ed that he would, and forced him&s;elf to think of nothing but of dividing with his two brothers the tender attentions which they paid their parent. They plunged in to the woods, went &s;till farther from Sabi, built them&s;elves a hut in a remote val|ley, and thought of &s;upplying by the chace, the maize and the vegetables which they were without.</P>
<P>DEPRIVED of their bows and arrows, and of all their other nece&s;&s;aries, which they had no time to carry away, they &s;oon began to feel the extreme of mi&s;e|ry. Fruits were in the&s;e fore&s;ts rarely to be found, where the prodigious number of apes were always prepared to di&s;pute them with the three broth|ers. The earth produced nothing but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. They had no in&s;trument to turn, nor grain to plant it. The rainy &s;ea&s;on came on, and the horrors of famine attacked them. The poor mother al|ways in mi&s;ery, reclined upon a bed of dry leaves, was ready to expire, but without a complaint. Her &s;ons, ex|hibited by hunger, could no longer pen|etrate

the woods which were deluged every where: they laid traps for the little birds which came near their hut, and when they took one, which rarely happened, for they had no longer any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, they carried it to their parent, and pre&s;enting it to her, forced from her a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e; but &s;he would not eat it unle&s;s divided with her children. Three months pa&s;&s;ed without any promi&s;e of change to their mi&s;erable &s;ituation. Compelled at length to take &s;ome &s;tep, they held a con&s;ultation at the de&s;ire of Darina. Guberi propo&s;ed fir&s;t they &s;hould penetrate as far as the coa&s;t, and &s;ell one of their number to the fir&s;t European they might meet; and to pur|cha&s;e with the money, bread, maize, and in&s;truments of agriculture, with which they might &s;upport their mother. The brothers replied to this, but with a melancholy &s;ilence&mdash;<Q>To &s;eperate from each other for ever! to become the &s;laves of white men!</Q> the Idea drove them near to di&s;traction. 'Which &s;hall be &s;old?' cried Teloa, in a tone of grief. 'Lots mu&s;t decide it,' repli|ed Guberi. <Q>Let us place three &s;tones of different &s;izes in this clay ve&s;&s;el, &s;hake them together, and he who

I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all; you forget that I have lo&s;t Beri&s;&s;a, and that you alone prevented me from dying, by &s;aying I might be u&s;eful to my mother.

<P>GUBERI and Teloa attempted in vain to oppo&s;e the generous pur|po&s;e of their brother; Selico re&s;i&s;ted their expo&s;tulations, refu&s;ed to draw his lot, and threatened to go by him|&s;elf if they would not accompany him; at length the two elde&s;t gave way. It was agreed that Guberi &s;hould continue with his mother, and that Teloa &s;hould conduct Selico to the Dutch fort, where he &s;hould receive the price of his broth|er's liberty, and that he &s;hould immedi|ately return with the provi&s;ions which they wanted. When this was deter|mined, Selico alone forbore to weep, but he found it difficult indeed to re|&s;train them when he was to leave his mother, bid her an eternal adieu, em|brace her for the la&s;t time, and what is more, deceive her by promi&s;ing &s;oon to return with Teloa, &s;aying that they were

only about to vi&s;it their former habita|tion, and to &s;ee if they could again take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The good old woman believed them, yet &s;he could hardly tear her&s;elf from her &s;ons arms; &s;he trembled at the danger they were about to encounter: and, by an involuntary motion, ran after Selico the moment &s;he lo&s;t &s;ight of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE two brothers, of whom it could not be &s;aid which was mo&s;t unhappy, in a &s;hort time arrived at Sabi. Mur|der had then cea&s;ed, peace began again to &s;mile, the king of Dahomai undi&s;|turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the States of Juida, wi&s;hed to encourage a commerce with Europeans, whom he invited to his city. Many Engli&s;h and French merchants were received at the Monarch's court, who &s;old them his numerous pri&s;oners, and divided among&s;t his troops the lands of the vanqui&s;hed. Teola &s;oon found a merchant who offered him an hundred crowns for his young brother. As he he&s;itated, trembled in all his limbs, and di&s;puted about this horrible bargain, a trumpet was heard, and a public cryer announced with a loud voice, that the king of Dahomai promi&s;ed: our hundred ounces of gold to whoever would bring

him alive a young Negro, who the night before bad dared to profane the &s;craglio of the Monarch, and had e&s;caped to|wards the ca&s;t, from the pur&s;uit of the guards. Selico heard the proclamation, made a &s;ign to Teloa not to conclude his bargain with the merchant; and taking his brother a&s;ide, &s;poke to him thus, in a firm tone: <Q>You are come to &s;ell me, and I wi&s;hed that you &s;hould, in order to &s;upport my mother, but the &s;mall &s;um which this white of|fers you cannot prove of material importance; four hundred ounces of gold will &s;ecure certain wealth for ever to you and Daria. You mu&s;t get this my brother; bind me this moment, and carry me to the King as the guilty per&s;on whom he wants,&mdash;Be not alarmed, I know as well as you do what puni&s;hment I have to expect, I have calculated how long it will endure, it will not exceed an hour, and when my mother brought me forth &s;he &s;uffered more.</Q></P>
<P>TELOA trembling could make no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> with tenderne&s;s and af|fection, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at the feet of Selico, embraced his knees, conjured him in the name of his mother, of Beri&s;&s;a, by
<PB N="35" REF="030546_0029_0FE7BACB9DE30040">
all he held dear, to renounce his terrible purpo&s;e. 'Of whom do you &s;peak,' &s;aid Selico, with a &s;evere &s;mile. <Q>I have lo&s;t Beri&s;&s;a, and I wi&s;h to meet her again. I &s;ave my mother's life by my death, I make my brothers rich for ever, and I e&s;cape a &s;lavery which might be protracted for forty years. My choice is made, pre&s;s me no far|ther, or I go and &s;urrender my&s;elf; you will then lo&s;e all advantage by my death, and you will occa&s;ion mi&s;ery to her to whom we owe our lives.</Q></P>
<P>AWED by the manner and the ac|cent in which Selico pronounced the&s;e la&s;t words, Teloa ventured not to re|ply; he obeyed his brother, went and got cords, bound his hands behind him, bathing the knots with his tears, and, making him walk before him proceeded to the King's palace.</P>
<P>STOPPED by the guards, he demand|ed an audience of the King: he was an|nounced and introduced. The King of Dahomai, covered with gold and pre|cious &s;tones, was reclining on a fear let &s;ofa, his head re&s;ting on the bo&s;om of his favori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es, who were dre&s;&s;ed in rich brocaded &s;ilks, but were naked from the wai&s;t upwards. His mini&s;ters and of|ficers
<PB N="36" REF="030546_0030_0FE7BAD0AF887CD0">
&s;uperbly dre&s;&s;ed, were pro&s;trate twenty feet from him. The mo&s;t va|liant were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a collar of human teeth, each of which te&s;tified a victory. Many females with mu&s;kets on their &s;houlders guarded the door of the apartment. Large golden va&s;es containing palm wine, brandy, and &s;trong liquors, were placed at &s;ome di&s;tance from the King, and the hall was paved with the &s;culls of his enemies. 'Sovereign of the world!' cried Te|loa, pro&s;trating him&s;elf on the ground, <Q>I come in compliance with your &s;acred orders to deliver into your hands&mdash;.</Q> He could not fini&s;h, and his voice died away upon his lips. The King interrogated him, but he could make no reply. At length Selico be|gan:</P>
<P>'KING of Dahomai,' &s;aid he, <Q>you &s;ee before you the guilty wretch who, induced by a guilty pa&s;&s;ion la&s;t night, penetrated the rece&s;&s;es of your &s;e|raglio. He who brings me here in chains was a long time my friend and I did not fear to tru&s;t him with my &s;ecret. Zeal for your &s;ervice has pre|vailed with him to violate his friend|&s;hip. He &s;urpri&s;ed me in my &s;leep,

has loaded me with chains, and comes to demand the reward; give it him for the mi&s;erable man has de&s;erved it.</Q></P>
<P>THE King, without vouch&s;afing any an&s;wer, made a &s;ign to one of his of|ficers, who, viewing the pri&s;oner, gave him into the cu&s;tody of the female guards, and paid Teloa the four hun|dred ounces of gold. This la&s;t, taking the gold, the touch of which agonized his &s;oul, went and purcha&s;ed provi&s;ions; and, precipitately leaving the town, made hade to his mother.</P>
<P>ALREADY, by order of the Prince, they were making ready the horrible puni&s;hment to which they are doomed who commit adultery with the wives of the &s;overeign. Two large trenches are &s;unk at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other. In that which is intended for the guilty female, they fix the unfortunate culprit to a &s;take, and all the women of the &s;eraglio, clothed in their mo&s;t &s;umptu|ous dre&s;&s;es, carrying in their hands large ve&s;&s;els of boiling water, advance to the found of tabors and flutes, to pour this water upon her head till &s;he expires. The other trench contains a pile of wood, upon which they place a cro&s;s

bar of iron, which is &s;upported by two rai&s;ed &s;takes. To this bar the criminal is &s;ecured, fire is &s;et to the pile and the wretched creatures pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;h after pro|tracted torments, being only reached by the extremities of the flame.</P>
<P>THE place was filled with people; the troops under aims formed a &s;quare, beating their &s;pears and mu&s;kets; the prie&s;ts, in their dre&s;&s;es of ceremony, waited for the two victims to lay their hands upon them and devote them to death. They appeared from different corners, guarded by the armed females. Selico, calm and re&s;igned, advanced with his head rai&s;ed up. When he came towards the &s;take he could not a|void lifting his eyes towards the com|panion of his mi&s;ery. What was his a&s;toni&s;hment and grief on beholding Beri&s;&s;a! He uttered a loud cry, and would have darted to her, but was with|held by the executioners. Soon his fir&s;t emotion gave way to indignation&mdash;'Wretch! that I am,' he cried, <Q>whil&s;t I courted death, hoping again to meet her, &s;he was among&s;t the&s;e vile fe|males who contend for a tyrant's affections. Not content with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in love, the was al&s;o faithle&s;s

<P>At this in&s;tant the wretched Beri&s;&s;a recognizing Selico uttered a loud &s;cream; &s;he called the prie&s;ts, and declared to them aloud, that the young man they were about to kill, was not he who had penetrated the &s;eraglio. She &s;wore this by the heavens, by the mountains, the thunder and the mo&s;t augu&s;t of the &s;acred &s;erpents. The prie&s;ts intimidated, ordered the execution to be &s;u&s;pended, and ran to inform the king, who was him&s;elf pre&s;ent. Indignation and fury di&s;tur|bed the countenance of the monarch when he approached Beri&s;&s;a.&mdash;'Slave!' &s;aid he in a terrible voice&mdash;<Q>thou who contemne&s;t the love of thy ma&s;ter, thou whom I would&s;t have rai&s;ed to the rank of my fir&s;t &s;ultana, and who in &s;pite of your refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al, I have &s;uffered to live, what is your purpo&s;e in pretending to deny the guilt of your accomplice.

lover, name who he is&mdash;deliver the guilty to my ju&s;tice, I will relea&s;e the innocent!</Q></P>
<P>'King of Dahomai,' replied Beri&s;|&s;a, who was already &s;ecured to the fatal &s;take, <Q>I cannot accept thy heart I po&s;&s;e&s;s not my own; I did not fear to tell you &s;o. Do you think that &s;he who would not live to &s;hare a crown, would &s;peak a fal&s;hood at the moment of death! No, I con|fe&s;s all, and repeat my refu&s;al. A man did la&s;t night enter my apart|ment, he did not leave it till the morning&mdash;but this was not the man! You a&s;k me to name him, I ought not, I will not; I am ready to die; I know that nothing can &s;ave me, and I only protract the fatal moment to prevent you from perpetrating a crime. I again &s;wear to you, king of Dahomai, that the blood of this innocent per&s;on will fall upon your head: deliver him, and puni&s;h me! I have no more to &s;ay.</Q></P>
<P>The king was &s;truck with Beri&s;&s;a's words, as well as with her manner of pronouncing them. He gave no or|ders, but reclining his head, was a&s;toni&s;hed
<PB N="41" REF="030546_0035_0FE7BADCF0EBBA38">
at the reluctance which he this moment felt to &s;hed blood. But re|membering that this negro had accu|&s;ed him&s;elf, and attributing to love, the intere&s;t which Beri&s;&s;a di&s;covered for him, all his rage was rekindled. He made a &s;ign to the executioners; the pile was lighted, the women ad|vanced with their ve&s;&s;els of boiling water, when an old man out of breath, covered with wounds and du&s;t, bur&s;t through the crowd, and &s;uddenly threw him&s;elf at the feet of the king.</P>
<P>'Stop!' &s;aid he, <Q>I implore you &s;top; I alone am the guilty per&s;on; it is I who have bur&s;t through the walls of your &s;eraglio, attempting the delivery of my daughter. I was once the high prie&s;t of the deity who was here adored. They tore my child from my arms, and conducted her to this palace. Since that time, I eagerly have &s;ought an opportunity to &s;ee her again. This la&s;t night I penetrated to her apartment&mdash;in vain did &s;he attempt to follow me, for your guards di&s;covered us.

I come to offer you your victim! I come to expire with her, for whom alone I de&s;ired to live!</Q></P>
<P>He had had hardly fini&s;hed when the king commanded the prie&s;ts to relea&s;e the unhappy pri&s;oners, and bring them before him.&mdash;He examined Selico, wi&s;hing to know what important mo|tive could induce him voluntarily to &s;eek &s;o dreadful a puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Selico, who&s;e heart panted with joy at finding Beri&s;&s;a again, and faithful, was not afraid to reveal every thing to the Monarch. He related to him his misfortunes, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his moth|er, and the re&s;olution he had taken to obtain for her the four hundred ounces of gold. Beri&s;&s;a and her father heard him with tears of delight and admira|tion: the chiefs the &s;oldiers, and the people melted with tenderne&s;s: the king him&s;elf perceived tears to fall, which never before had bedewed his cheeks.&mdash;Such is the charm of virtue, that barbarians them&s;elves adore it!</P>
<P>After hearing Selico, the king gave him his hand, and bade him ri&s;e, and, turning to the European merchants, whom this &s;pectacle had collected,

<P>Ju&s;t as he uttered the word de&s;pair, he was going to plunge into the lake be|neath him, at once to &s;atisfy his doubts, and put a period to his anxiety; when he perceived a mo&s;t maje&s;tic being walking on the &s;urface of the water, and approaching the bank on which he &s;tood.

<P>"Still, however," &s;aid A&s;em, "the inhabitants mu&s;t be happy; each is contented with his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, nor avariciou&s;ly endeavors to heap up more than his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; each has the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">efore lei&s;ure to pity tho&s;e that &s;tand in need of his compa&s;&s;ion."

They have, however, a|nother excellency yet behind; the love of their country is &s;till, I hope, one of their darling virtues." "Peace, A&s;em," replied the guardian, with a countenance not le&s;s &s;evere than beau|tiful, "nor forfeit all thy pretentions to wi&s;dom; the &s;ame &s;elfi&s;h motives by which we prefer our own intere&s;t to that of others, induce us to regard our country preferably to that of a|nother. Nothing le&s;s than univer&s;al benevolence is free from vice, and that you &s;ee is practi&s;ed here."

Take me, O my genius, back to that very world which I have de&s;|pi&s;ed; a world which has Alla for its contriver, is much more wi&s;ely form|ed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> that which has been projected by Manomet.

<P>He had &s;carce ended, when the genius, a&s;&s;uming an air of terrible complacency, called all his thunders around him, and vani&s;hed in a whirl|wind. A&s;em, a&s;toni&s;hed at the ter|ror of the &s;cene, looked for his imag|inary world; when, ca&s;ting his eyes

around, he perceived him&s;elf in the very &s;ituation, and in the very place where he fir&s;t began to repine and de&s;pair: his right foot had been ju&s;t advanced to take the fatal plunge, nor had it been yet withdrawn; &s;o in&s;tant|ly did Providence &s;trike the &s;eries of truths ju&s;t imprinted on his &s;oul. He now departed from the water &s;ide in tranquillity, and, leaving his horrid man&s;ion, travelled to Sege&s;tan, his na|tive city; where he dilligently applied him&s;elf to commerce, and put in prac|tice that wi&s;dom he had learned in &s;olitude. The frugality of a few years &s;oon produced opulence; the number of his dome&s;tics increa&s;ed; his friends came to him from every part of the city; nor did he recieve them with di&s;dain: and a youth of mi&s;ery was concluded with an old age of elegance, affluence, and ea&s;e.</P>

My father who&s;e name was William Seymour, lived in the town of Bri&s;tol, in England, and followed mer|chandi&s;e. In the early part of my life, he had been &s;ucce&s;sful in bu&s;ine&s;s, and had prudently depo&s;ited a compe|tency in the funds, in ca&s;e of acci|dents (to which trade is proverbially expo&s;ed.)

While my father was in the full career of &s;ucce&s;s, my &s;i&s;ter married a gentleman of fortune, family, ed|ucation and benevolence.

<P>But the tide was now to ebb, the &s;cene was to undergo a change,&mdash;a change which fir&s;t brought me to an acquaintance with &s;orrow and misfor|tune.

any thought or weakne&s;s of the heart from her friend. Among other te&s;timonies of mi&s;s Stanford's affection for me was the communication of the letters of a favorite brother. Their elegance were &s;uch as plea&s;ed my fan|cy&mdash;and their warmth of expre&s;&s;ion &s;uch as touched my heart.

After many weeks of tedious ex|pectation, the vacancy at length came, when the &s;tudents of the university were permitted to return to their re&s;|pective homes, to &s;ee their friends, and to procure whatever articles were nece&s;&s;ary for u&s;e or convenience at the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>After his return to the univer&s;ity, he wrote to his &s;i&s;ter more frequently than ever.

the en&s;uing night was I kept awake in revolving the &s;cene that had taken place. Sometimes I was &s;atisfied, and again out of temper with what had pa&s;&s;ed.

<P>On his next vi&s;it, he found me in the garden alone with my work and my book.

<P>This an&s;wer, though &s;evere and pain|ful, was le&s;s &s;o than it would otherwi&s;e have been, from our preparation for it.

<P>He had received a letter from his brother in law, in which mr.

his heart by giving vent to his &s;or|row for a few moments. After this, he found him&s;elf able to communicate the grounds of his di&s;tre&s;s. The weight of a father's di&s;plea&s;ure he had prepared him&s;elf to endure, but to find that di&s;|plea&s;ure pur&s;uing him &s;o far as to prevent him from receiving any aid from an uncle, was beyond what he had &s;u&s;pected.

Accordingly, the next day, mr. Stanford went in que&s;t of cheap and plea&s;|ant lodging, and of employment.

For this &s;ituation mr.

<P>My health was declining&mdash;my &s;pir|its were gone&mdash;and <HI>I</HI> was induced to believe, that a voyage acro&s;s the ocean would re&s;tore both.

On the&s;e grounds I concluded, that if urged a|gain by Julia, and by her future com|panion, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould con&s;ent to attend them. A few days after this, my

<HEAD>From a letter to Benjamin Vaughan, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> member of the Briti&s;h Parliament written in 1784</HEAD>
<P>IT is wonderful how prepo&s;terou&s;ly the affairs of this world are man|aged. Naturally one would imagine
<PB N="117" REF="030546_0111_0FE7C503A41CC040">
that the intere&s;t of a few individuals &s;hould give way to the general inter|e&s;t; but individuals manage their af|fairs with &s;o much more application, indu&s;try and addre&s;s, than the public do theirs, that general intere&s;t mo&s;t commonly gives way to particular.&mdash;We a&s;&s;emble parliaments and coun|cils, to have the benefit of their col|lected wi&s;dom; but we nece&s;&s;arily have at the &s;ame time, the inconvenience of their collected pa&s;&s;ions, prejudices, and private intere&s;ts. By the help of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, artful men overpower their wi&s;dom, and dupe its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and if we may judge by the acts, arrets, and edicts, all the world over, for regulating commerce, an a&s;&s;embly of great men is the greate&s;t fool upon earth.</P>
<P>I have not yet, indeed; thought of a remedy for luxury. I am not &s;ure that in a great &s;tate it is capable of a remedy: nor that the evil is in it&s;elf always &s;o great as it is repre&s;ented.&mdash;Suppo&s;e we include in the definition of luxury, all unn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ary expence, and then let us con&s;ider whether laws to prevent &s;uch expence are po&s;&s;ible to

be executed in a great country, and whether, if they could be executed, our people generally would be happi|er, or even richer. Is not the hope of being one day able to purcha&s;e and enjoy luxuries, a great &s;pur to labour and indu&s;try? May not luxury there|fore produce more than it con&s;umes, if without &s;uch a &s;pur, people would be, as they are naturally enough in|clined to be, lazy and indolent? to this purpo&s;e I remember a circum|&s;tance. The &s;kipper of a &s;hallop, employed between Cape-May and Philadelphia had done us &s;ome &s;mall &s;ervices, for which he refu&s;ed to be paid. My wife under&s;tanding that he had a daughter, &s;ent her a pre&s;ent of a new fa&s;hioned cap. Three years after, this &s;kipper being at my hou&s;e with an old farmer of Cape-May, his pa&s;&s;enger, he mentioned the cap, and how much his daughter had been plea&s;ed with it. "But (&s;aid he) it proved a dear cap to our congrega|tions,"&mdash;"How &s;o?"&mdash;"When my daughter appeared with it at meeting, it was &s;o much admired, that all the
<PB N="119" REF="030546_0113_0FE7C50B6ADD5BB0">
girls re&s;olved to get &s;uch caps from Philadelphia; and my wife and I computed that the whole could not have co&s;t le&s;s than a hundred pounds"&mdash;"True, (&s;aid the farmer) but you do not tell all the &s;tory.&mdash;I think the cap was neverthe|le&s;s an advantage to us; for it was the fir&s;t thing that put our girls upon knitting wor&s;ted mittens for &s;ale at Philadelphia, that they might have wherewithal to buy caps and ribbons there; and you know that indu&s;try has continued, and is likely to contin|ue and increa&s;e to a much greater val|ue, and an&s;wer much better purpo&s;es." Upon the whole, I was more reconcil|ed to this little piece of luxury, &s;ince not only the girls were made happier by having fine caps, but the Philadel|phians by the &s;upply of warm mit|tens.</P>
<P>In our commercial towns upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t, fortunes will occa&s;ionally be made. Some of tho&s;e who grow rich will be prudent, live within bounds, and pre&s;erve what they have gained for their po&s;terity: others fond of &s;hewing their wealth, will be extrav|agant

and ruin them&s;elves. Laws cannot prevent this; and perhaps it is not always an evil to the public. A &s;hilling &s;pent Idly by a fool may be picked up by a wi&s;er per&s;on, who knows better what to do with it. It it therefore not lo&s;t. A vain, &s;illy fel|low builds a fine hou&s;e, furni&s;hes it richly, lives in it expen&s;ively, and in a few years ruins him&s;elf: but the ma&s;ons, carpenters, &s;miths, and o|ther hone&s;t trade&s;men, have been by his employ a&s;&s;i&s;ted in maintaining and rai&s;ing their families: the farmer has been paid for his labour, and encour|aged, and the e&s;tate is now in better hands. In &s;ome ca&s;es indeed, certain modes of Luxury may be a public evil, in the manner as it is a private one.&mdash;If there be a nation, for in&s;tance, that exports its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">f and linen, to pay for the importation of claret and porter, while many of its people live upon po|tatoes, and wear no &s;hirts; wherein does it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ter from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who lets his family &s;tarve, and &s;ells his cloathes to buy drink?

<P>The va&s;t quantity of fore&s;t land we have yet to clear, and put in order for cultivation, will for a long time keep the body of our nation laborious and frugal. Forming an opinion of our people and their manners, by what is &s;een among the inhabitants of the &s;ea ports, is judging from an improper &s;ample. The people of the trading towns may be rich and luxurious, while the country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the vir|tues that tend to promote happine&s;s and public pro&s;perity. Tho&s;e towns are not much regarded by the coun|try; they are hardly con&s;idered as an e&s;&s;ential part of the &s;tates; and the experience of the la&s;t war has &s;hewn, that their being in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, did not nece&s;&s;arily draw on the &s;ubjection of the country, which bravely continued to maintain its freedom and independence notwith|&s;tanding.</P>

It has been computed by &s;ome po|litical arithmetician, that if every man and woman would work four hours each day on &s;omething u&s;eful, that labour would produce &s;ufficient to procure all the nece&s;&s;aries and com|forts in life; want and mi&s;ery would be bani&s;hed out of the world, and the re&s;t of the 24 hours might be lei&s;ure and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>What occa&s;ions then &s;o much want and mi&s;ery? It is the employment of numbers in works that produce neither the nece&s;&s;aries or conveniences of life, who with the&s;e who do nothing, con|&s;ume nece&s;&s;aries rai&s;ed by the labori|ous. To explain this:</P>
<P>The fir&s;t elements of wealth are obtained by labour, from the earth and waters. I have land, and rai&s;e corn. With this, if I feed a fam|ily that does nothing my corn will be con&s;umed, and at the end of the year I &s;hall be no richer than I was at the beginning. But if while I feed them, I employ them, &s;ome in &s;pinning, others in making bricks, &amp;c. for building, the value of my corn will be arre&s;ted and remain with me, and at the end of the year we may be
<PB N="123" REF="030546_0117_0FE7C519FADD4A48">
all better cloathed and better lodged. And if, in&s;tead of employing a man I feed in making bricks, I employ him in fiddling for me, the corn he eats is gone, and no part of his manufacture remains to augment the wealth and convenience of the family; I &s;hall therefore be the poorer for this fid|dling man, unle&s;s the re&s;t of my fam|ily work more or eat le&s;s, to make up the deficiency he occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Look round the world, and &s;ee the millions employed in doing nothing&punc; or in &s;omething that amounts to no|thing, when the nece&s;&s;aries and con+veniences of life are in que&s;tion.&mdash;What is the bulk of commerce, for which we fight and de&s;troy each other, but the toil of millions for &s;uperflui|ties, to the great hazard of many lives, by the con&s;tant dangers of the &s;ea? How much labour is &s;pent in building and fitting great &s;hips, to go to China and Arabia for tea and coffee, to the We&s;t Indies for &s;ugar, and to America for tobacco? The&s;e things cannot be called the nece&s;&s;aries of life, for our ance&s;tors lived very comfortably without them.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="030546_0118_0FE7C5200FD24718">
A que&s;tion may be a&s;ked; Could all the&s;e people now employed in rai|&s;ing, making, or carrying &s;uperflui|ties, be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by rai&s;ing nece&s;&s;a|ries&punc; I think they might. The world is large, and a great part of it &s;till uncultivated. Many hundred mil|lions of acres in A&s;ia, Africa, and America, are &s;till in a fore&s;t; and a great deal even in Europe. On a hundred acres of this fore&s;t, a man might become a &s;ub&s;tantial farmer; and a hundred thou&s;and men employ|ed in clearing each his hundred acres, would hardly brighten a &s;pot big e|nough to be vi&s;ible from the moon, unle&s;s with Her&s;chel's tele&s;cope; &s;o va&s;t are the regions &s;till in wood.</P>
<P>It is however &s;ome comfort to re|flect, that, upon the whole, the quan|tity of indu&s;try and prudence among mankind, exceeds the quantity of idle|ne&s;s and folly. Hence the increa&s;e of good buildings, farms cultivated, and populous cities filled with wealth, all over Europe, which a few years &s;ince were only to be found on the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean; and this notwith|&s;tanding the mad wars cotin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lly ra|ging,

<HEAD>PROSPERITY AND ADVERSITY</HEAD>
<HEAD>An agllegorical tale</HEAD>
<P>Two of the daughters of Provi|dence were &s;ent to the hou&s;e of a rich Phenician merchant, named
<PB N="126" REF="030546_0120_0FE7C5275B2E86D0">
Vela&s;co, who&s;e re&s;idence was at Tyre, the capital city of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Pro&s;perity, the elde&s;t, was beauti|ful as the morning, and chearful as the &s;pring; but Adver&s;ity was &s;or|rowful and ill-favored.</P>
<P>Vela&s;co had two &s;ons, Felix and Uriano. They were both bred to commerce, though liberally educated, and had lived together from their in|fancy in the &s;tricte&s;t harmony and friend&s;hip; but love, before whom all affections of the &s;oul are as the traces of a &s;hip upon the ocean, which remain only for a moment, threatened in an evil hour to &s;et them at variance; for both of them were become enam|oured with the beauties of Pro&s;perity. The nymph, like one of the daugh|ters of men, gave encouragement to each, by turns: but to avoid a particu|lar declaration, &s;he vowed a re&s;olution never to marry, unle&s;s her &s;i&s;ter, from whom &s;he &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to be long &s;eparated, was married at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Vela&s;co was no &s;tranger to the pa&s;|&s;ions of his &s;ons, and dreading every thing from their violence, to prevent
<PB N="127" REF="030546_0121_0FE7C528E50A2D80">
ill con&s;equences, he obliged them by his authority to decide their preten|&s;ions by lot, each previou&s;ly engaging in a &s;olemn oath to marry the nymph that &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ll to his &s;hare. The lots were accordingly drawn, and Pro&s;per|ity became the wife of Felix, and Ad|ver&s;ity of Uranio.</P>
<P>Soon after the celebration of the&s;e nuptials, Vela&s;co died, having be|queathed to his elde&s;t &s;on, Felix, the hou&s;e wherein he lived, and the great|e&s;t part of his large patrimony and ef|fects.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band of Pro&s;perity was &s;o tran&s;ported with the gay di&s;po&s;ition and enchanting beauties of his bride, that he clothed her in gold and &s;ilver, and adorned her with jewels of ine&s;ti|mable value. He built a palace for her in the woods; he made rivers in his gardens, and beautified their banks with temples and pavilions; he enter|tained at his table the nobles of the land, delighting their cars with mu|&s;ic, and their eyes with magnificence; but his kindred he beheld as &s;trangers, and the companions of his youth pa&s;&s;|ed by him unregarded. His brother

al&s;o became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in his &s;ight; and, in proce&s;s of time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> commanded the doors of his hou&s;e to, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t him.</P>

<P><PB N="129" REF="030546_0123_0FE7C5303A400490">
What become of him afterwards, tradition does not with certainty re|late. It is believed he fled into E|gypt, and lived precariou&s;ly on the &s;canty benevolence of at few friends who had not totally de&s;erted him; and that he died in a &s;hort time, poor, wretched, mi&s;erable, and an exile.</P>
<P>Let us now return to Uranio, who, we have already ob&s;erved, had been driven out of doors by his brother Felix. Adver&s;ity, though hateful to his heart, and a &s;pectre to his eyes, was the con&s;tant attendant on his &s;teps; and, to aggravate his &s;orrows, he received certain intelligence that his riche&s;t ve&s;&s;el was taken by a Sar|dinian pirate; that another was lo&s;t upon the Lybian &s;traits; and, to com|plete all, the banker, with whom the greater part of his ready money was entru&s;ted, had de&s;erted his creditors, and retired into Sicily. Collecting, therefore, the &s;mall remains of his fortune, he bid adieu to Tyre, and, led by Adver&s;ity, he pa&s;&s;ed through unfrequented roads, and fore&s;ts over|grown with bu&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="030546_0124_0FE7C5364206F390">
He came at la&s;t to a &s;mall village, at the foot of a mountain; here they took up their abode for &s;ome time; and Adver&s;ity, in return for all the anxiety he had &s;uffered, &s;oftening the &s;everity of her looks mini&s;tered to him the mo&s;t faithful coun&s;el, weaning his heart from the immoderate love of earthly things, and teaching him to revere the Almighty, and to place his whole tru&s;t and happine&s;s in his gov|ernment and protection. She human|ized his &s;oul, made him mode&s;t and humble, taught him to compa&s;&s;ionate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his fellow creatures, and in&s;tructed him to relieve them.</P>

<P>The lofty elm over&s;hadowed her dwelling, and the lowly evergreen crept around her door. Here the once gay Euphro&s;yne, that lately &s;hone in all the circles of the beau monde, was ob&s;cured as in the &s;hadowey vale; but in the vale &s;he was convinced that happine&s;s does not dwell on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> grandeur.</P>
