<Q><HI>And I will clothe him with thy Robe, and &s;trengthen him with thy Girdle; and I will commit thy Government into his Hand, and he &s;hall be a</HI> FATHER <HI>to the Inhabitants of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and to the Hou&s;e of</HI> Judah.</Q>

<P>_I Need not tell any here the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of <HI>this Anniver&s;ary Solemnity</HI>; It being too well known already to make this nece&s;&s;ary; but &s;hall chu&s;e rather, in the Words of <HI>another,</HI> &s;poken, not upon the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> yet on an high and great Occa&s;ion, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid <HI>Atterbury</HI>'s Ser. before the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Go|vernours</HI> of the <HI>Ho&s;pitals,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> to &s;ay, (partly in order to

obtain, if it may be, the <HI>Candour</HI> of this <HI>augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly</HI>; and partly, to <HI>apologize</HI> for the many Defects which my <HI>Hearers</HI> will doubtle&s;s di&s;cover in the <HI>pre&s;ent Performance</HI>) That <Q>So many eminent Pens have gone before in this Way, as have left it very difficult for tho&s;e who come after, either to &s;ay any Thing which they <HI>have not</HI> &s;aid, or not to &s;ay, that much wor&s;e which they <HI>have.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon being informed, that our <HI>Honourable Rulers</HI> (&s;ure I am, very unexpected to me) had <HI>Ordered</HI> I &s;hould Preach before Them on <HI>this</HI> &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, my Thoughts fixed upon the <HI>Words</HI> read; which, if God &s;hall plea&s;e to afford his gracious A&s;&s;i&s;tance, may be profitably handled, and appear to be <HI>a Word in Sea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>In order to the clearer Under&s;tanding of <HI>them,</HI> it will be requi&s;ite to look back to the 15th Ver&s;e of the Chapter, where, and in the Ver&s;es following, the Prophet is directed to go and deliver a &s;ad Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Shehna,</HI> to tell him, that though he made <HI>Prepa|ration</HI> for a pompous Sepulture in the Place where he then was, he &s;hould <HI>&s;urely</HI> be <HI>violently to&s;&s;ed like a Ball into a large Country,</HI> and <HI>there die,</HI> and be &s;uc|ceeded in his Office by one better than he, meaning <HI>Eliakim.</HI> As to <HI>Shehna</HI> and <HI>Eliakim</HI> <Q>Both of them had been Mini&s;ters of State under King <HI>Hezekiah, Shehna</HI> having been his Scribe or Secretary, and <HI>Eliakim</HI> the Ma&s;ter of his Hou&s;hold. And their Hi&s;tory (&s;ays a learned Man <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prideaux</HI>'s Connection, &amp;c. Vol. I. P.45.</NOTE>) as far as may be collected from the Words of the Prophet, ap|pears to be thus. <HI>Shehna</HI> being a very wicked Man was a fit Per&s;on to &s;erve the Lu&s;ts and
<PB N="7" REF="006175_0006_102803650C5A1430">
evil Inclinations of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> in the fir&s;t Part of his Reign, and therefore was made his fir&s;t Mi|ni&s;ter Of State; and <HI>Eliakim,</HI> who was of a quite contrary Character, was quite laid a&s;ide. But on the Revolution that happened on the coming of the Army of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians, Shehna</HI> was taken Pri|&s;oner with his Ma&s;ter, and carried to <HI>Babylon,</HI> and there detained in Captivity to his Death. And therefore <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> on his Repentance and return to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> having re&s;olved on other Mea&s;ures, called for <HI>Eliakim,</HI> and put the Management of all his Affairs into his Hands, who being a Per&s;on of great Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice and Piety &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hed them upon the &s;ame Foot as they had been in the Days of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and &s;o pre&s;erved them in Peace and Pro&s;perity all his Time, to the great Honour of the King, and the Good of all his People, and therefore he hath the Character given him of being a <HI>Father to the Inhabitants of</HI> Je|ru&s;alem, <HI>and to the Hou&s;e of</HI> Judah.</Q> Thus he.</P>
<P>The <HI>Robe</HI> and <HI>Girdle</HI> mentioned in the Text, are En&s;igns of <HI>Authority.</HI> The Former very peculiar to <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> hence it is &s;aid concerning the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>Jeho&s;ophat</HI> the King of <HI>Ju|dah,</HI> that they <HI>&s;at each on his Throne, having put on their Robes.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 22.10.</NOTE>&mdash;Purple</HI> was anciently the Colour of the Garment or Robe worn by the Chief Ruler among the <HI>Romans</HI>: So that to &s;end any one the <HI>Purple</HI> was in Effect to declare him <HI>Emperour</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Due</HI> Hi&s;t.

<PB N="8" REF="006175_0007_102800E6F4AF3690">
a Girdle, becau&s;e a Girdle cau&s;eth Strength. A good Ruler is the <HI>Strength,</HI> the <HI>Girdle</HI> of his Poeple. For by his wi&s;e and ju&s;t Admini&s;tration, an en&s;eebled State will be cheri&s;hed and invigorated, confirmed and united, as a <HI>Girdle</HI> or <HI>Belt</HI> doth bind and &s;trength|en the Loins of him that wears it.</P>
<P>It follows,</P>
<P><HI>And I will commit thy Government into his Hand.</HI> Civil Government is not an <HI>accidental</HI> Thing, which Men have hit upon by Chance, but is of Divine In&s;titution; <HI>By Me Kings reign</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8.15.</NOTE>. <HI>The Powers that be, are ordained of God,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13.1.</NOTE>. And this <HI>Ordination</HI> is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that Public Communities cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. <HI>Anarchy</HI> unavoidably tends to Confu&s;ion and Ruin. When <HI>there was no King in</HI> I&s;rael, 'tis &s;aid <HI>every Man did that which was right in his own Eyes.</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Judges 17.6.</NOTE> And when this comes to be the Ca&s;e, a wor&s;e State of Things can hardly be imagined.</P>
<P>Whereas, When the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate</HI> is to tho&s;e under his In&s;pection, what <HI>Eliakim</HI> is told here in the Text, he &s;hould be <HI>to the Inhabitants of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and to the Hou&s;e of</HI> Judah, <HI>viz.</HI> A FATHER, there will be more than a &s;eint Image of the happy Times that were in <HI>Solo|mon</HI>'s Reign, when it is &s;aid, <HI>Judah and I&s;rael dwell &s;afely, every Man under his Vine, and under his Fig-Tree.</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 4.25.</NOTE> The Appellation here fixed upon <HI>Eliakim</HI> is a fit Title for a good <HI>Governour.</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eng. Annot.</HI> in loc.</NOTE> And therefore you may be &s;ure, that in the Progre&s;s of this Di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall not forget it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006175_0008_10280366D27DF688">What has been &s;aid upon the Words under Con&s;i|deration, opens the Way for the&s;e Two Ob&s;ervations, which I &s;hall offer from them,</P>
<P>Ob&s;. I That <HI>there are</HI> outward <HI>Marks of Di&s;tinction and Honour, and En&s;igns of Authority, which e&s;pecially belong to the Civil Magi&s;trate.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;. II That <HI>Good Rulers are, and &s;hould be</HI> FATHERS to their People.</P>
<P>I &s;hall handle both the&s;e Points with as much Bre|vity as I can conveniently; &s;uppo&s;ing that the <HI>Elections</HI> to be made this Day of His MAJESTY'S COUNCIL, will not admit of a <HI>long Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> from the Pulpit. The</P>
<P>1^s^t Ob&s;. is this, That <HI>there are</HI> outward <HI>Marks of Di&s;tinction and Honour, and En&s;igns of Authority which e&s;pecially belong to the Civil Magi&s;trate.</HI></P>
<P>Notice is here taken of the <HI>Robe, Girdle,</HI> or <HI>Belt,</HI> and el&s;ewhere <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Job 29.14</NOTE> of the <HI>Diadem</HI>; all which, as al&s;o <HI>Crowns, Scepters, Gold Chains,</HI> &amp;c. are Emblems of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI>; and therefore <HI>Princes</HI> and Potentates, have by the unanimous Vote of Mankind, had the&s;e Marks of Re&s;pect conferred upon them. All Ages have been content, that tho&s;e who <HI>govern</HI> them &s;hould be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the <HI>Vulgar,</HI> and make a more &s;plendid Appearance upon all Occa&s;ions than a <HI>Pea&s;ant.</HI> And if they do not, they are apt to be look'd upon with Contempt. <Q>Hi&s;tory (&s;ays one <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Caryl.</HI></NOTE>) makes report of a very famous <HI>King,</HI> who coming to <HI>Egypt,</HI> a mighty Concour&s;e of people flocked from all Parts to &s;ee
<PB N="10" REF="006175_0009_102800E9C9576350">
him, but when they found him without any <HI>State,</HI> an old man in a mean Habit, they went away Laugh|ing, none regarding him.</Q></P>
<P>But not to inlarge here; I &s;hall proceed to offer a few <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> why tho&s;e who are advanced to Places of Power (as Civil Rulers are) &s;hould be <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> from others, by <HI>external</HI> marks of <HI>Grandeur.</HI> And they are the&s;e that follow,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To be a Motive to Rulers to excite them to Vi|gilance and Care for the Good and Welfare of tho&s;e, on who&s;e Account they have a ju&s;t Title to tho&s;e En&s;igns of Authority.</HI> A <HI>Ruler</HI> is not prefer'd to <HI>that</HI> Dignity only to give him Lie&s;ure to be &s;lothful and indolent, put in order to in&s;pire him with Re&s;olutions of acting in his exalted Station agreable to it: So that the Ho|nours done to him ought, and &s;hould be &s;o many <HI>Monitors</HI> to him, to lay out him&s;elf with &s;o much the greater Diligence and Fidelity in &s;erving the <HI>Publick.</HI></P>
<P>I believe the high Dignity <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was rai&s;ed to in <HI>Egypt,</HI> was a con&s;iderable <HI>Incentive</HI> to him to be very active in promoting the Welfare of that Kingdom. For after the Account that is given of the Marks of Re&s;pect <HI>Pharaoh</HI> put upon him, by placing him next to him|self in Authority, and giving him his <HI>Ring</HI> from off his Finger, clothing him with <HI>&s;ine Linnen,</HI> and putting a <HI>gold chain about his Neck</HI>; I &s;ay, after all this, it is &s;aid, that <HI>Jo&s;eph went out over all the Land of Egypt</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 41.41, 42, 43, 45.</NOTE>. He forthwith applied him&s;elf to the Duties belonging to his Station, and did not content him&s;elf at Home in the enjoyment of the Honours conferred upon him, but by
<PB N="11" REF="006175_0010_10280369A3EC1F08">
his Diligence and Activity in his Office, let the King who had thus advanced him &s;ee, that his Favours were not mi&s;plac'd.</P>
<P>Indeed, Civil Rulers have much better, &s;tronger and higher Motives to be public <HI>Benefactors</HI> than any <HI>Ex|ternal Honours,</HI> that are done them, can be; &s;uch as their being in a Capacity more <HI>exten&s;ively</HI> to <HI>&s;erve</HI> their <HI>Generation,</HI> than tho&s;e who move in a lower Sphere; and the high <HI>Reward</HI> that &s;hall be given them in Hea|ven, if they do it <HI>religiou&s;ly.</HI> But &s;till <HI>outward Marks</HI> of Re&s;pect and Honour have their u&s;e and influence to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The publick Honours paid to Civil Rulers are partly de&s;igned for the <HI>Safeguard</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> of their <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI> If Rulers behave in their Office &s;uitable to the Dignity of it, and di&s;charge with a laudable Fidelity the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, the <HI>State</HI> ought to be more than a little concerned to pre&s;erve and protect them. Men in high Stations are &s;ometimes expo&s;ed to the Rage of unthinking People, and malign'd by envenom'd Tongues, while at the &s;ame Time they are endeavour|ing faithfully to &s;erve the Public; <HI>Is it a &s;mall Thing that thou ha&s;t brought us up out of a Land that floweth with Milk and Honey, to kill us in this Wilderne&s;s, ex|cept thou make thy &s;elf altogether a Prince over us?&mdash;Wilt thou put out the Eyes of the&s;e Men? We will not come up,</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> 16.13, I4.</NOTE> is Language that the meeke&s;t Man on Earth, and one of the be&s;t Rulers, was treated with, by an obliged, tho' ungrateful People. And it were well, if nothing of this Spirit were now to be found in the World, The Civil Ruler being <Q>the <HI>Guardian</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="006175_0011_102800EB502F2488">
of the publick Quiet; appointed to re&s;train Violence,&mdash;and to pre&s;erve that Order and Peace which pre&s;erves the World: It is apparent, on the&s;e, and many other Accounts, what Hazards a good Ma|gi&s;trate runs; and therefore the Retinue of State which belongs to him, is &s;uch as may, at the &s;ame Time, be his Ornament and Defence.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> External Marks of Honour are like|wi&s;e appropriated to Rulers, in order to promote in tho&s;e under their Authority a proper E&s;teem and Re|gard for them. Not that it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed any are &s;o weak as to be influenced to behave dutifully towards Rulers, and treat them with Reverence merely on the Account of the outward Splendor, annexed to their Office, but that <HI>this</HI> may be &s;ome Inducement to People to &s;hew them that Re&s;pect and pay that Defference to them which is ju&s;tly due to their Character.</P>
<P>None then &s;hould envy the civil Ruler tho&s;e Marks of Honour which the Oracles of God entitle him to, and the Wi&s;dom of Nations hath thought it proper he &s;hould enjoy: Since &s;uch valuable Ends as we have heard may be &s;erved hereby.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">II. Ob&s;. That <HI>Good Rulers are, and &s;hould be</HI> FATHERS <HI>to their People.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas my Purpo&s;e chiefly to have in&s;i&s;ted upon <HI>this,</HI> but the Time, I perceive, will not admit of much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> here; and therefore &s;hall content my&s;elf as briefly as I can,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="006175_0012_1028036EE30BA630">1. To &s;hew, <HI>Wherein</HI> Civil Rulers &s;hould be FATHERS to their People. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. What <HI>Obligation</HI> they are under to be &s;o.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to &s;hew, <HI>Wherein</HI> Civil Rulers should be FATHERS to their People.</P>
<P>This is an Appellation given in the Scripture to Per&s;ons cloathed with Publick Authority. Hence KINGS are called <HI>nur&s;ing Fathers</HI>; and <HI>Naaman</HI>'s Servant addre&s;&s;ed him in the &s;ame Stile of Re&s;pect and Reverence, who <HI>was a great Man with his Ma&s;ter</HI> (the King of <HI>Syria</HI>) <HI>and Honourable,</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 5.1.13.</NOTE>
<HI>My Father, if the Prophet had had thee do &s;ome great Thing,</HI> &amp;c. And 'tis related of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> (who perhaps was one of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, before the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> was publickly countenanced in <HI>that State,</HI>) that when <Q>the People offer'd him the Title of <HI>Lord,</HI> he re|fu&s;ed it, and thought the Title of <HI>Pater Patria</HI> more honourable</Q> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ducter. Hi&s;t.</HI> Vol. II. <HI>P.</HI> 3.4.</NOTE>, as indeed it was.</P>
<P>Now there are &s;everal Ways wherein <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> (who are <HI>Political Fathers</HI>) may, and &s;hould mani|fe&s;t their <HI>paternal</HI> Regards to tho&s;e who are under their Authority,</P>
<P N="1">1. By their <HI>Love</HI> to them. The Love of <HI>natural Parents</HI> to their <HI>Children</HI> is exceeding great: <HI>Can a Woman forget her &s;ucking Child</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">I&s;al. 49.15.</NOTE>? Intimating that
<PB N="14" REF="006175_0013_102800EEDEEF6F00">
it is a very unlikely Thing, and next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility, <HI>David</HI> wi&s;h'd he might have died in&s;tead of his Son <HI>Ab|&s;olom; Would God,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I had died for thee</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 18.33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And &s;hall no Foot&s;teps of <HI>paternal</HI> Affection be found in tho&s;e who are <HI>political Fathers?</HI> Since <HI>both</HI> are &s;tiled <HI>Fathers,</HI> may it not be ju&s;tly expected, that there &s;hould be &s;omething <HI>&s;imilar</HI> in them? Certainly, <HI>civil Rulers</HI> may be look'd upon rather as <HI>Tyrants</HI> than FA|THERS, if they be not cordial <HI>Lovers</HI> of tho&s;e whom they rule over: <HI>God be gracious to thee my Son,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to his Brother <HI>Benjamin</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gen. 43.29.</NOTE>. Which, perhaps, was &s;po|ken rather as <HI>Superiours</HI> were wont to do to tho&s;e below them <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Patrick</HI> in Loc.</NOTE> than becau&s;e he was his near Relation; tho' it may include <HI>both.</HI> If the <HI>former</HI> be only meant, then it &s;hews great Regard, Love and Affection, <HI>civil Rulers</HI> ought to have for tho&s;e who are Subject to their Authority</P>
<P>The Truth is, if <HI>political Fathers</HI> have no <HI>real Affecti|on</HI> for their People, 'tis not probable that there will be any <HI>mutual Confidence</HI> between them. They will always be <HI>jealous</HI> one of the other; and the <HI>One</HI> will be apt to <HI>rule as Tyrants,</HI> and the <HI>Other</HI> to <HI>obey as Slaves</HI>; becau&s;e they cannot help it.</P>
<P>So that it is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to an&s;wer the Ends of civil Government, that <HI>Rulers</HI> &s;hould behave towards their <HI>People,</HI> with the Tenderne&s;s and Affection of FA|THERS. So did <HI>Nehemiah, David,</HI> and <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> and divers others in the <HI>fir&s;t Chair of Government,</HI> which are found on Scripture Record.</P>

<P>And while I am &s;peaking of the&s;e Things, I cannot pa&s;s over in Silence, the late excellent ACT made con|cerning <HI>profane Cur&s;ing and Swearing</HI>; for which, I doubt not, all good Men are very <HI>thankful,</HI> and <HI>ble&s;s</HI> God, that he was plea&s;ed to put it into the Hearts of our <HI>honourable Rulers</HI> to make &s;uch a noble and heroic STAND again&s;t &s;o <HI>prevailing</HI> an Iniquity.</P>

<P N="3">3. Civil Rulers, as <HI>Fathers</HI> of their People, &s;hould u&s;e much <HI>Prudence</HI> in exerci&s;ing their Authority.

<P>For Want of <HI>prudent Management, Rehoboam</HI> lo&s;t the <HI>greater</HI> Part of his Subjects. Had he given them good

Words, and followed the &s;age Advice offered him by his grave Coun&s;ellors, the unhappy Separation that en|&s;ued, might (humanely &s;peaking) have been prevented:</P>
<P>But his Conduct was &s;uch, even when his <HI>all,</HI> in a Manner (as to his Regal Authority) lay at Stake, that the wor&s;t of his Enemies could not wi&s;h him to act more fooli&s;hly than he did.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid by the old Men, who had been of his Father's Council, <HI>If thou wilt be a Servant unto this People this Day, and &s;peak good Words to them, then they will be thy Servants forever</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 12.7.</NOTE>. But he had not the Wi&s;dom to take their Advice, and thereupon great Confu&s;ion followed. See here, <HI>How requi&s;ite Prudence, and wi&s;e Conduct is in Civil Rulers.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. and La&s;tly, Civil Rulers &s;hould manife&s;t their <HI>Paternal</HI> Care of their People, by &s;etting before them a <HI>good Example.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not ea&s;y to imagine what a mighty Influence a pious Ruler's Example is apt to have upon tho&s;e who are under his Authority. Children, we &s;ee, have a &s;trong Propen&s;ity to approve and practice what is done by their Parents: And the Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame with Re&s;pect to <HI>Civil Fathers</HI>; THE EXAMPLE OF THE KING being a Maxim that mo&s;t &s;eem willing to conform unto.</P>
<P>Therefore it mu&s;t needs have a great Tendency to promote the be&s;t Inter&s;ts of a People when their <HI>politi|cal Fathers</HI> are Per&s;ons of eminent Piety, and bright Examples of <HI>pure and undefiled Religion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="006175_0018_102800D1C6998788">The Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> would have had no Regard to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ho&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and tho&s;e that were with them, had it not been for the Re&s;pect he bore to King <HI>Jeho&s;aphat</HI> on the account of his great <HI>Piety; And</HI> Eli&s;ha <HI>&s;aid unto the King of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>What have I to do with thee?&mdash;Surely were it not that I regard the Pre&s;ence of</HI> Jeho&s;aphat, <HI>the King of</HI> Judah, I WOULD NOT LOOK TOWARD THEE, NOR SEE THEE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 3.13, 14.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>II Place, as was propo&s;ed, to mention the <HI>Obligations</HI> they are under to <HI>be &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>And I &s;hall Name only Two at pre&s;ent,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>great Trust</HI> committed to Civil Rulers ought to be a &s;trong Inducement to them to exert their Autho|rity, in all proper Ways, for the Good of their People, and to carry as <HI>Fathers</HI> to them.</P>
<P><HI>Natural Fathers</HI> look upon their <HI>Off-&s;pring</HI> to be an important Charge (as indeed it is) and therefore are willing to run all Hazards to pre&s;erve them, and to promote their Welfare.</P>
<P>And the like Concern (in &s;ome Degree) ought Civil Fathers to have for their Poople.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="006175_0019_102800FBC0477CC8">Thus they &s;hould carefully con&s;ult their Intere&s;t in all Re&s;pects; advi&s;e them in the be&s;t Manner they can, and upon all difficult Emergencies appear in the Gap for their Relief. Hear how <HI>Job</HI> (who doubtle&s;s had been a Man in Authority) &s;peaks concerning him&s;elf, <HI>I delivered</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>the Poor that cried, the Fatherle&s;s, and him that had none to help him. The Ble&s;&s;ing of him that was ready to peri&s;h came upon me; and I cau&s;ed the Widows Heart to &s;ing for Joy. I was Eyes to the Blind, and Feet was I to the Lame: I was a Father to the Poor, and the Cau&s;e which I knew not, I &s;earched out: And I brake the Jaws of the Wicked, and plucked the
Spoil out of his Teeth</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Job. 29.12,&mdash;17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus to do is the &s;ure&s;t Cour&s;e Civil Rulers can take to &s;ecure to them&s;elves the amiable Character of true <HI>Patriots.</HI> And indeed for this very End and Purpo&s;e were they appointed, and not <HI>to lord it over their Infe|riours.</HI></P>
<P>And upon the Account of the <HI>great Trust</HI> repo&s;ed in <HI>Political Fathers,</HI> and the heavy Burden they &s;u&s;tain, tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to their Government, ought to look on them&s;elves as bound in Duty and Con&s;cience to pray earne&s;tly to God for them <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 2.1, 2.</NOTE> <Q>As for his Direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the Di&s;charge of their high Office, &s;o likewi&s;e for his powerful Grace to pre&s;erve them from Sin and Evil, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e manifold Temptations to which they are continually expo&s;ed, in Appearance much beyond other Men, from the Heigth of that Condition, and he Extent of their Power, &mdash; and from the officious Servility of <HI>Para&s;ites</HI> and <HI>Flatterers,,</HI> who &s;ooth them in their Faults, and

<P N="2">2. If Rulers do not behave as <HI>Fathers</HI> towards their <HI>People,</HI> there is <HI>Danger</HI> of their <HI>lo&s;ing the Honour, E&s;teem and Reverence,</HI> which otherwi&s;e they might ju&s;tly expect to receive from them. The <HI>Subject</HI>'s Love is the <HI>Prime</HI>'s &s;tronge&s;t Cittadel. If Rulers are tyrannical and cruel in their Government, they mu&s;t look for no <HI>chear|ful,</HI> but only a <HI>forc'd</HI> Submi&s;&s;ion to be paid them. If tho&s;e under Authority perceive their Rulers have no <HI>paternal</HI> Concern for them, they will be apt to have but little Affection for their <HI>Civil Fathers</HI>; which mu&s;t needs be productive of great Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order in the Body Politic: <HI>One</HI> will be jealous of the <HI>other</HI>; and when <HI>Power</HI> is vi&s;ibly abu&s;ed <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> will be found an hard Ta&s;k.</P>
<P>That Parent who governs his Children with a prudent Lenity or Gentlene&s;s, and appears to be deeply concern|ed for their Welfare on all Accounts, takes the &s;ure&s;t Cour&s;e to entitle him&s;elf to their &s;incere Re&s;pect, and to be truly honoured by them. Whereas he that is rigorous and always treats them in a churli&s;h imperious Manner, is only <HI>&s;lavi&s;hly feared,</HI> but not <HI>cordially loved.</HI></P>
<P>And the Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame as to <HI>Political Fathers</HI>: If by <HI>them</HI> the People <HI>enjoy great Quietne&s;s, and very worthy Deeds are done unto</HI> them, by their <HI>Providence,</HI> they probably will <HI>accept of it always, with all Thank|fulne&s;s.</HI> Sure I am, they would be liable to &s;evere Cen|&s;ures

<P>But there is one Thing that I mu&s;t by no Means omit the mentioning of, and that is, to recommend a PUBLICK SPIRIT, which is &s;o much wanting in <HI>this Land</HI>; and which is equally nece&s;&s;ary to be found not only in Rulers, but the People al&s;o, in order to our be|coming a pro&s;perous and flouri&s;hing State.

<HEAD>APPLICATION</HEAD>
<P>In which 'tis my Purpo&s;e to be very brief.</P>
<P>Use I. Hence how great a <HI>Mercy</HI> ought a People to account it, when God gives &s;uch to rule over them who are concerned to promote their be&s;t Intere&s;ts, and de&s;irous to &s;hew them all the Affection and Tender|ne&s;s of kind Fathers. And &s;uch a Mercy our Nation and Land enjoy in his pre&s;ent MAJESTY, our <HI>Rightful and most Gracious Sovereign King</HI> GEROGE II. who, we tru&s;t, e&s;teems it a greater Honour to be the Common Father of his Loyal Subjects, than to wear the Imperial Crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;uch, we hope, His <HI>Excellency</HI> our Commander in Chief, and all our <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> will be to <HI>this Province.</HI> And if they are indeed &s;o, and we do not accordingly E&s;teem and Honour and Support them, let every Body call us ungrateful, and they cannot call us wor&s;e, or &s;ay any Thing of us that is more to our Di&s;credit.</P>
<P>'Tis ju&s;tly to be look'd upon as an high Favour when Rulers are ambitious of arriving to the Character of being <HI>Fathers</HI> to their People. All Things in the <HI>State</HI> will then probably be carried on with much Ea&s;e and Unanimity; <HI>Rulers</HI> will not gra&s;p after <HI>more</HI> Power than properly belongs to them, nor the <HI>People</HI> be under a Temptation to wi&s;h it <HI>le&s;s</HI> than it is.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="006175_0023_102801019C405C60">And thus there will be an admirable Harmony be|tween Rulers and Ruled, which is the Beauty and Glory of all Communities both civil and &s;acred.</P>

<P>I now turn my &s;elf to the honourable His <HI>Ma|je&s;ty's</HI> COUNCIL, and the Gentlemen of the honoura|ble Hou&s;e of REPRESENTATIVES;</P>
<P>To the Former, (by who&s;e <HI>Appointment,</HI> in Con|junction with his <HI>Excellency</HI>'s, I &s;tand here <HI>to Day</HI>) I would humbly &s;ugge&s;t, that the very <HI>Title</HI> you wear, <HI>His Maje&s;ty's Council!</HI> &s;hould be a powerful Motive to engage you to con&s;ult, according to the be&s;t of your Skill and Judgment, the Affairs of the Pro|vince, and all the valuable Intere&s;ts of it; and to give the wi&s;e&s;t Advice you are able, under our pre|&s;ent difficult and perplexed Circum&s;tances. Let your <HI>Coun&s;el</HI> have no Mixture, no Alloy of <HI>&s;elfi&s;h Views,</HI> but mainly aim at the Good of the <HI>Publick.</HI> We have been almo&s;t <HI>undone</HI> by the Prevalency of a <HI>pri|vate, &s;elf-&s;eeking Spirit</HI>; may it no more be found a|mong us: E&s;pecially, may <HI>you,</HI> who are <HI>civil Fathers,</HI> excell in <HI>publick Spiritedne&s;s,</HI> and teach us all by your Example, to be ambitious of the &s;ame excellent Cha|racter.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="006175_0027_1028010621A8DA10">To the Gentlemen who repre&s;ent the Province, I would only &s;ay; do you need to be put in Mind, how great a Tru&s;t is repo&s;ed in you by your Con|&s;tituents; and what an Influence the Choice of Coun|&s;ellors to be made this Day (chiefly by your &s;elves) may have upon the Government?</P>
<P>Let not then the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day &s;eem as a light Matter or trifling Concern to any of you. Re|member that your Tru&s;t is great (as I intimated but now) and that both God and Man expect you di&s;|charge it faithfully.</P>
<P>There is one Thing, though it may &s;eem a little out of the Way to mention it here, yet in a&s; much as it is &s;o great a Frown of Providence upon us all, and &s;o much damps our publick Joy <HI>this Day,</HI> I can't but name it, and that is the De&s;truction of our <HI>State-Hou&s;e</HI> by Fire, which we may &s;till behold lying all in Ruins. May we be duly affected therewith, and <HI>bewail the burning which the</HI> LORD <HI>hath kindled.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed,</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who are in the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI>: 'Tis need|le&s;s now to take up the Time in an Addre&s;s to <HI>them,</HI> &s;ince that will be particularly done To-morrow by a much abler Hand.</P>
<P>To the <HI>People in general,</HI> I have only this com|prehen&s;ive Word to offer, <HI>Be dutiful and obedient to your Civil Fathers, and at Peace among your&s;elves.</HI> Forget not the Words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>Every Kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf is brought to De&s;ola|tion</HI>;
