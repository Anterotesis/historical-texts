<P>THE Life of man in this pre|&s;ent world is celebrated by many Ma&s;ters of Morality among the Heathen, under the notion of a <HI>Warfare:</HI> but <HI>the&s;e</HI> were never able by their mo&s;t exalted Theories to &s;tate the true nature, or pre|&s;cribe the ju&s;t rules for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ful di&s;|charge hereof: For after all their E&s;&s;ayes, the undi&s;ciplined Combatant will need dire|ction; and the &s;aint hearted, encouragement in the day of Battel. But now Chri&s;tianity

does &s;upply all the&s;e defects: This gives us a more exalted notion of this <HI>Warfare;</HI> and lays down the be&s;t rules for the conduct of the Chri&s;tian Souldier from his fir&s;t Entring the <HI>Line of Battel,</HI> till death &s;hall rai&s;e the <HI>Camp,</HI> and give him a <HI>di&s;charge.</HI> Here the Conduct and Prowe&s;s of the General, under who&s;e Banner he is to fight, is di&s;played; the power and policy of tho&s;e Enemies, which he is to agonize and conflict with, is laid open; the good cau&s;e, in which he is to Engage, di&s;covered; and the glorious prae|mium, or prize, which he is to contend for, is &s;et forth, and a&s;&s;ured to the Victor; a Prize &s;ufficient to in&s;pire every brea&s;t that has the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of true honour, with all the E&s;&s;entials of an heroical re&s;olution, and unbroken courage.</P>
<P>How a Soul &s;hall di&s;charge this Warfare, as becomes the honour of Chri&s;t his Leader, the goodne&s;s of the Cau&s;e, and the glory of the reward is a Quaery of no common im|portance: The re&s;olution of which in &s;hort is, that the faithful di&s;charge hereof con&s;i&s;ts in a punctual ob&s;ervation of his <HI>Commanders Orders.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Orders are plainly and fully con|tained in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Oracles of Truth, which if ob&s;erved, the Combat will be crown+ed with Victory, and the Victory end in an

everla&s;ting Triumph: Now the&s;e Orders are exceeding large; as exten&s;ive as the Law of God, which the Royal Prophet tells us, is exceeding broad: The latitude of which Or|ders con&s;i&s;ts in their being adapted to all the Children of men under their various circum|&s;tances, and Employments. There is no po&s;t, &s;tation or profe&s;&s;ion but what they ex|tend to, and afford conduct in: They reach the King on the Throne, and &s;toop to the Beggar on the Dunghill: They are directive, and obligatory to the Prie&s;t at the Altar, to the Judge on the Tribunal, and the Souldier in the Camp, and in all his preparations here for: So that by a faithful di&s;charge of the duties of their re&s;pective po&s;ts on Chri|&s;tian Principles they will make glorious ad|vances to the un&s;haken Kingdom of Eternal Light and Love.</P>
<P>Agreeable to all this, Chri&s;t, the Believers Commander, having withdrawn him&s;elf as to bodily pre&s;ence from his <HI>Militant Camp</HI> on Earth, and being advanced to the head of his <HI>Triumphant Armies</HI> in Heaven; has in ad|mirable wi&s;dom Sub&s;tituted an Order of men, to repre&s;ent his Per&s;on, act in his name as Under Officers; and the&s;e &s;tand obliged by the duties of their function to publi&s;h, explain and apply his Orders in their full extent and latitude.

of one <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> in this &s;acred Order, to bring out or his Storehou&s;e things new and old, and to give every one their portion in due &s;ea&s;on; and neither hopes nor fears are to move them from this duty of their charge. A Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter in the di&s;charge of his Office, is not only to de|clare the general duties of Chri&s;tianity, which re&s;pect all in common, that are Li&s;t|ed under Chri&s;t Je&s;us; but as opportunity calls, to make a more clo&s;e application of particular duties to men in their re&s;pective capacities; and to warn them again&s;t tho&s;e temptations which endanger their welfare in their &s;everal Stations. When Chri&s;t's Amba&s;&s;adors do thus, they are not to be trea|ted as de&s;erters of their proper charge; nor voted guilty of an u&s;urpation, or an Inva&s;ion made on anothers Province: But it is to be accounted a &s;pecimen of that wi&s;dom and fidelity, which become the character of <HI>Stew|ards in Chri&s;ts Hou&s;hold.</HI> A glorious in&s;tance of this prudence and faithfulne&s;s we have before us in <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> in his treatment of per&s;ons of divers Orders, agreeable to their &s;everal characters.</P>

<P>From the words there are two A&s;&s;ertions which &s;hall employ our pre&s;ent meditations.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="assertion">
<HEAD>A&s;&s;ertion I. That Military Men, or Souldiers, are an Order of men allowable and proper in a Chri&s;tian State.</HEAD>
<P>This is a truth that every one, who is not blinded by prejudice, mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to as in|conte&s;table: Who can di&s;pute the lawfulne&s;s of this Order, that do but take a view of tho&s;e principles, which the God of Nature has originally implanted in humanity; who do con&s;ider the Hi&s;tory and Doctrine both of the Veiled and Unveiled Go&s;pel; and withal ob&s;erve the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence in the world? Yet this has been confronted by the &s;tronge&s;t efforts of Wit, and Art: Thus it has been a&s;&s;aulted by <HI>So|cinus,</HI> and the main body of the <HI>Racovian</HI> Rout, together with many giddy Enthu&s;i|a&s;ts, who li&s;ted under their Banner to defy and fight again&s;t the Truths of the <HI>Living God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001016_0009_0FAEEDB31557C2A8">
It mu&s;t indeed be acknowledged that War to which Military men bear a relation, is an evil to be deprecated: The tragical Re|cords of all Ages do &s;peak in bloody chara|cters what fearful de&s;olation it makes: and this is given by &s;ome as a rea&s;on why in the Sacred Records the &s;ame word is &s;ometimes u&s;ed to &s;ignifie War, and Harve&s;t: becau&s;e in War men are reapt and mown down by the Sword; as Gra&s;s and Corn by the Scyth and Sickle. <HI>Every Battel,</HI> faith the Evange|lical Prophet, <HI>is with confu&s;ed noi&s;e, and gar|ments rolled in blood. I&s;a. 9.5.</HI> But yet this does not argue that War is Subver&s;ive of Chri&s;tianity; or that this Order of men, who are to tran&s;act in this affair is not to be allowed in Go&s;pel Dayes: for Souldiers are not only allowable, but proper and nece&s;&s;a|ry in a Chri&s;tian State. To &s;tate and illu&s;t|rate this A&s;&s;ertion, let us remark.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there would have been no occa&s;ion for men of Military Order, had man retained his primitive integrity.</HI> This was not from the beginning. The Original State or Nature is not a &s;tate of War. Had the Divine I|mage on man, which con&s;i&s;ted in the inde|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ective rectitude of all his powers, remained in its created brightne&s;s; had not the glory of humane nature been &s;ullyed by &s;in; there would have been no foundation for men of
<PB N="9" REF="001016_0010_0FAEEDB399426670">
a Military quality. There would have been no Armies to confront or guard again&s;t; no Pa&s;&s;es to be forced; no Seiges to be rai&s;ed; no Garri&s;ons to be Storm'd Unblemi&s;hed Innocency would have pre&s;erved mankind in perfect Amity. This Order therefore is con&s;equent upon the Apo&s;ta&s;y: Had not man de&s;erted that Pa&s;t God at fir&s;t placed him in, turned <HI>Revolter;</HI> and put him&s;elf under a <HI>forreign juri&s;diction;</HI> and jovn'd with the Rebel Ho&s;t of Apo&s;tate Spirits in the cur&s;ed con&s;piracy again&s;t God; there would have been no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, nor di&s;cord among men. Had not Sin drawn the <HI>flaming Sword</HI> of Divine Ju&s;tice, men would never have drawn the Sword again&s;t one another: The whole Earth would have been a <HI>Sanctuary of Peace,</HI> whereas Sin has now made it an <HI>Aceldama,</HI> a field of blood, a Stage on which the mo&s;t <HI>bloody Tragedies</HI> have been acted.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Were the principles of Chri&s;tianity fully en+tertained and acted upon in the world, there would be no need of Military men.</HI> Peace among men is one ble&s;&s;ing which the Go&s;pel of peace naturally tends to introduce. The ho|ly principles of our ble&s;&s;ed Religion are ad|mirably adapted to in&s;pire men with a Ca|tholick love and tenderne&s;s to each other: They tend to remove the cau&s;es of Wars and Contentions. The Go&s;pel when entertained
<PB N="10" REF="001016_0011_0FAEEDB460B87700">
gives check to mens malicious lu&s;ts, regulates and controuls their exorbitant pa&s;&s;ions: and <HI>the&s;e are they that draw the Sword,</HI> Jam. 4 1. <HI>From whence come wars, and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts, that war in your members?</HI> The ble&s;&s;ed rules of Chri&s;t ob&s;erved will mortify the inordinate Ambition of a&s;piring Monarchs, they will keep them from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the boundaries of <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> to enlarge their Territories, advance their Empire, and &s;atiate their helli&s;h Pride, to which whole Kingdoms many times fall devoted Victims.

<P N="3">3. This <HI>notwith&s;tanding the Publick weal re|quires &s;uch an order of men in a Chri&s;tian &s;tate; &amp; con&s;equently they are by the rules of Chri&s;tianity allowable and proper.</HI> The Go&s;pel has not obtained &s;uch full entertainment in the world,

It is high handed pre&s;umption for a Chri&s;tian people to depend on God, by the miraculous interpo&s;ition of his Providence, to &s;hield them from ruin, while they neglect the proper means for their own &s;ecurity: For though God can, and &s;ome|times do's &s;ave, without, nay contrary to means, yet his ordinary and &s;tated way is to appear by his ble&s;&s;ing on means for the Sal|vation of his I&s;rael. Hence according to the ordinary Series of Providence, it is many times impo&s;&s;ible for a People to maintain Peace at home, &s;ecure their Civil and Sacred Liberties from the inva&s;ion &amp; incroachments of unrea&s;onable men, unle&s;s the Sword be drawn. The publick tranquillity &s;ometimes makes a War eligible: It is indeed a devour|er, <HI>but out of that eater meat will come forth.</HI> <Q>At certain Times the Publick Calamities (as one &s;aye&s;) are of that nature, that <HI>pre|parations of Steel</HI> are found to be the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;ful Antidotes:</Q> and there is no po&s;&s;ibi|lity of curing the&s;e maladies but by the&s;e <HI>Chaly beates:</HI> Now Military men are nece&s;&s;ary to apply this remedy to a &s;ick &amp; langui&s;hing State: Hence by the Law of &s;elf pre&s;ervati|on,

<HEAD>A&s;&s;ertion II. That there are Duties incumbent on Souldiers, which Chri&s;tianity obliges and encourages them to the di&s;charge of.</HEAD>
<P>De&s;igned brevity will permit me only to give a re&s;olution to this Enquiry, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>What are tho&s;e duties which Chri&s;tianity does oblige &amp; encourage Souldiers to the di&s;charge of?</HI></P>
<P>And here, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on tho&s;e du|ties, which are not only incumbent on Soul|diers, but al&s;o on all in common, who are Entred into Chri&s;t's Mu&s;ter roll.</P>
<P>There is but one way that leads to the City of the Living God; and in that way both the Prince and Pea&s;ant, bond and free, both Gown, and Sword men, mu&s;t <HI>Storm the Kingdom of Heaven, and take it by violence.</HI></P>
<P>But that my di&s;cour&s;e may in &s;ome mea|&s;ure ly level to the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent day, I &s;hall only con&s;ider the duties that our Religion obliges Souldiers unto, as <HI>&s;uch;</HI> which have an immediate a&s;pect upon them in their Military Capacities. And that my thoughts here may be di&s;tinct, it &s;eems not improper to di&s;tingui&s;h between Souldiers only in preparation by their Military Exer|ci&s;es for real Service; and &s;uch as are actu|ally called to real Service, to jeopardi&s;e their lives in the high places of the field. It &s;eems
<PB N="14" REF="001016_0015_0FAEEDBBDE3907B0">
to be no great decorum in treating Souldi|ers at home, in peace, with the &s;ame addre&s;s as is &s;uited to tho&s;e that are ingaged in War, actually confronting an in&s;olent Adver&s;ary. Here then we may e&s;&s;ay a &s;hort account of the duties, which by the Laws of Chri&s;tiani|ty, are incumbent on each. And.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As to the duties which Chri&s;tianity obliges Souldiers to di&s;charge, who are only by their Mi|litary Exerci&s;es at home in preparation for War.</HI> And the duties of the&s;e may be ranckt under five general heads: As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Chri&s;tianity obliges Souldiers to engage in the&s;e preparative Military Exerci&s;es for a right end,</HI> &s;uch as God <HI>may approve of.</HI> It is the <HI>Prerogative</HI> of man, by which he is rai&s;ed a|bove the level of the inferiour Creation, to act upon deliberation, and free Election, <HI>as a cau&s;e by Coun&s;el</HI> of his own actions: hence he mu&s;t act for &s;ome End; which he is to have in his eye, and make the mea&s;ure of his actions; which End ought to be &s;ome|thing worthy and proportionable to tho&s;e intellective and elective powers, with which humane nature is Ennobled. And this is one principal hinge on which the moral good, or evil of his actions does turn. For though the <HI>Intention</HI> of a good End be not of it &s;elf &s;ufficient to legitimate, or con&s;ecrate an act|ion, <HI>as &s;ome have vainly a&s;&s;erted;</HI> yet the want
<PB N="15" REF="001016_0016_0FAEEDBC9A7FD040">
of it will de&s;ecrate and prophane the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Such therefore, as would engage in any af|fair, &s;o as to ob&s;erve therein the dictates of the Chri&s;tian Religion, mu&s;t look well to their end; that it be &s;uch, as may be approved of at the Tribunal of God, &amp; the bar of unpre|judiced rea&s;on; to both of which man &s;tands accountable. Here then, by the rules of Chri&s;tianity, the Souldier in the&s;e his prepara|tory Exerci&s;es &s;tands obliged to have a good end in his intention. And this ought to be the &s;ame end with that, for which the <HI>Art Military</HI> was fir&s;t contrived &amp; in&s;tituted. In this affair that maxim of the Schools is not to take place, <HI>Non Idem finis Artis et Artificis:</HI> the end of the Art and Arti&s;t is not here to be di&s;tingui&s;ht: Now this end is as ultimately the honour of God, in the good and &s;afety of the Common weal, &s;o nextly to be prepared for real Service, when the publick &s;afety calls for it. Military Exerci&s;e is not to be lookt on as a play fit for Children, but as a work &amp; bu&s;ine&s;s for men: Men are to engage in the&s;e Exerci&s;es not meerly for diver&s;ion, but with an actual de&s;ign to get them&s;elves ready to &s;tand <HI>in the high places of the field, to &s;peak with the Enemy in the gate,</HI> when Providence &s;hall call them forth. This end, it is be feared, is far from the thought of the mo&s;t, that put them&s;elves under di&s;cipline: The mo&s;t never

By the want of this end the Chri&s;tian Souldi|er violates his Chri&s;tian obligation: without this de&s;ign of real Service the&s;e Exerci&s;es, with what pomp &s;o ever managed, are but a vain &s;hew; which according to the rules of Reli|gion will deface the Character of a Martial Spirit.

And there are many things, which the Souldier is obliged by Chri&s;tianity to take heed again&s;t, as that which will &s;ubvert his end in the&s;e preparatory Exerci&s;es: we may hint at &s;ome of them.</P>
<P><HI>Tbus the Souldier is obliged to take heed again&s;t luxury and debauchery.</HI> For the&s;e will ema&s;cu|late and effeminate his Spirits, and &s;o unfit him to enter the li&s;t again&s;t an hardy foe. <HI>He that &s;triveth for ma&s;tery,</HI> faith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>is temperate in all things, 1 Cor. 9. 25.</HI> Intempe|rance enfeebles the body, and renders it unfit for heroick actions; it &s;oftens the mind, and &s;o indi&s;po&s;es the man for any noble &amp; great re&s;olves; but prepares him to be an ea&s;y prey to an in&s;ulting Enemy. This proved fatal to <HI>Benhadad</HI> &amp; his confederate Princes, <HI>I King.</HI> 20 16.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Sloth and Idlene&s;s the Souldier at home is obliged to watch again&s;t.</HI> A Military life is a life of action; and whatever unfits for action unfits for that Service. Now &s;loth by a Phy&s;ical efficiency abates the vigour, and damps the noble purpo&s;es of the Soul; it ru&s;ts

the Spirits, and cau&s;es the faculties of ope|ration to contract an unaccountable hebitude and dulne&s;s. Idlene&s;s is a &s;ort of Lethargy that benums the active powers of the Soul, &amp; lays them a&s;leep. It renders the Souldier a|ver&s;e to undertake and incapable to undergo the fatigues of a Martial Expedition. The &s;lothful is never like to blazon his own glo|ry, defend his Country, or advance its renown by his Exploits in the field of War. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> therefore is to be condemned as de&s;tructive of the true end of Souldiery, and as &s;uch, pro|hibited by the rules of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>What e|ver thine hands find to do, do with all thy might: Be not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are docu|ments of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>The Souldier mu&s;t avoid every thing that tends to nouri&s;h Security</HI> Security will keep him from due preparations; and expo&s;e to inevitable ruine, when danger approaches.

<P>Again, <HI>Chri&s;tianity obliges them to take heed that they do not over rate, and value the pre&s;ent life.</HI> An over value for life will unfit a Souldi|er for that Service, in which he mu&s;t carry his life in his hand: it will indi&s;po&s;e him to
<PB N="19" REF="001016_0020_0FAEEDBFF9A14008">

<P>Finally, <HI>Chri&s;tians obliges that they take heed of an ungovernable Spirit.</HI> Such a Spirit in Souldiers threatens all with confu&s;ion: it is the &s;pring from whence all mutinies, and in|&s;urrections proceed: when this &s;pirit troubles the Camp, nothing but de&s;olation is to be ex|pected: it is the wor&s;t of plagues, that can invade an Army; it is infectious, &amp; threatens the whole; it &s;pread, like a gangreen; and is ordinarily cured by no <HI>lennives,</HI> but only by the &s;harpe&s;t <HI>corro&s;ives</HI> of Martial di&s;cipline. Chri&s;tianity therefore requires Souldiers while at home in peace in the&s;e Exerci&s;es, to take heed again&s;t this ungovernable &s;pirit, as that which is ob&s;tructive to the true end of Soulde|ry: And the <HI>prevailing of this Spirit is judged by per&s;ons of thought &amp; ob&s;ervation to be not the lea&s;t ill Omen that attends the Military affairs of this Land.</HI> Now again&s;t all the&s;e things, which are impedimental to the end of Military or|der, our Religion enters a caution.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It obliges to diligence in the pur&s;uit of this
<PB N="20" REF="001016_0021_0FAEEDC4947F8730">
End by the mo&s;t proper and accommodable means.</HI> He that is obliged to will the End, is obli|ged to chu&s;e, and diligently to pur&s;ue the means that lead to that End. Hence Soul|diers being obliged in their pre&s;ent Exerci&s;es to make preparation for real Service, in or|der to the publick repo&s;e; they &s;tand obli|ged by the &s;ame rule, to u&s;e the mo&s;t proper means to get ready. To this end Chri&s;tia|nity requires, that the Souldier get furni&s;ht with <HI>proper Armour,</HI> or <HI>Martial Weapons:</HI> Without the&s;e he can't be prepared for Ser|vice; neither to defend him&s;elf, nor to of|fend his Adver&s;ary. And it is no &s;ea&s;on to &s;eek for Arms, when called into the Field. It is no wonder the uncircumci&s;ed <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> did obtain an ea&s;y Triumph over <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when there was <HI>not a Shield or a Spear found among fourty thou&s;and of I&s;rael, Judg</HI> 5. 8. As the Spiritual Souldier is not prepared to main|tain his po&s;t again&s;t the Militia of Hell, un|le&s;s arrayed with the whole Armour of God; &s;o the proper Souldier will not be pre|pared to prevent, or repel the violence of his adver&s;aries, unle&s;s provided with Arms. Religion and rea&s;on demand this provi&s;ion <HI>And &s;uch trifle with duty, who neglect it.</HI></P>
<P>Again, it obliges Souldiers to a due care that they may attain <HI>Military Science.</HI> Wea|pons are to no purpo&s;e without &s;kill to u&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="001016_0022_0FAEEDC57A634400">
them. He that in the&s;e preparatory Exer|ci&s;es does not attain expertne&s;s therein, when called to Engage, will find his Armour al|mo&s;t as unea&s;y and u&s;ele&s;s, as the Stripling <HI>David</HI> did <HI>Sauls;</HI> and for the &s;ame rea&s;on becau&s;e he <HI>had not proved it.</HI> Skill in the Art Military is a nece&s;&s;ary medium to that End which Chri&s;tianity propounds to the Souldier. And the mo&s;t polite Nations have mo&s;t endeavoured after proficiency here|in. It is the opinion of &s;ome ver&s;t in anti|quity, that the Jews had their School for the Souldier, as well as the Prophet; by which they maintained their Glory. Sure we may be it was the wi&s;dom of the Patriarch <HI>Abra|ham</HI> to di&s;cipline his Hou&s;hold. <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. 14. It was <HI>Davids</HI> prudence, after <HI>Sauls</HI> defeat at <HI>Mount Githoa,</HI> to order the in&s;truction of the <HI>men of Judah in the u&s;e of the bow, 2 Sam.</HI> 1. 18. Dexterity in this Art layes the foun|dation for Martial Glory. Without this &s;kill an Army for number mo&s;t formidable may be put to the rout by a few well di&s;ciplin'd Troops. We &s;hall find abundant witne&s;s of this, if we con&s;ult the records of Antiquity: This it was that Crown'd <HI>Alexander</HI> with victorious Lawrels, and loaded him with the Spoils of his undi&s;ciplined Enemies: This ad|vanced <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> to a Triumphal Chariot: By this <HI>Rome</HI> enlarged her Dominions, and her
<PB N="22" REF="001016_0023_0FAEEDC59D7BE9A0">
Inhabitants vanqui&s;hed in Battel double the number of Enemies, who po&s;&s;ibly might e|qual, if not &s;urpa&s;s them in natural &s;trength and courage. The Glory of mo&s;t King|doms has ebb'd and flow'd with this &s;kill. This therefore is a nece&s;&s;ary medium to real Service: It is not therefore to be lookt on as a matter of indifference, but of Chri&s;tian obligation, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world.</P>
<P>Another medium which tends to fit the Souldier for Service <HI>is Good Orders.</HI> Religion therefore obliges to due care for the pre&s;er|vation hereof. Order is the beauty of the Univer&s;e; the Strength and Glory of all Societies; without which they would di&s;|band and crumble into nothing: Without Order a <HI>Bethel</HI> will become a <HI>Babel,</HI> an <HI>Army</HI> a confu&s;ed <HI>Rout.</HI> Now this Order among Souldiers con&s;i&s;ts in every one's keeping to the duties of their re&s;pective places: When the Officers duly give out their Orders; and tho&s;e under Command do not conte&s;t them; but with quick obedience move in the line of duty: It is fatal to a Military Body to have this Order broken: The pre&s;ervation of it is one good &s;tep to make it unconque|rable. Agreeably we have this de&s;cription of an invincible Army. <HI>Joel 2 7. They march every one in his way; and none &s;hall break their ranks.</HI> The wi&s;dom of all Nations has judg|ed
<PB N="23" REF="001016_0024_0FAEEDC656DB6120">
the greate&s;t &s;everity of Martial Di&s;cipline ju&s;tifyable towards &s;uch, as break this Order. And the greate&s;t Generals by the Execution of this Di&s;cipline, have in all Ages &s;ignalized their &s;teady conduct. Memorable is the ac|count we have of <HI>Papirius</HI> the Dictator, who was with great difficulty per&s;waded to &s;pare the life of young <HI>Fabius,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of his Hor&s;e, for fighting, though &s;ucce&s;&s;fully, in his ab&s;ence, and again&s;t Order. Famous is the Story of <HI>Titus Manlius,</HI> who condemned his own brave Son to Death; for the like victo|rious attempt; being repugnant to Order. No Order, without indi&s;putable Obedience; this therefore, as one &s;ayes, is the Key &s;tone of the Arch, which binds and &s;u&s;tains the whole fabrick.</P>
<P>Now if Order be thus nece&s;&s;ary to an Ar|my when called abroad to fight, it follows that the maintainance of it at home is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparative to real Service. None can in the&s;e preparatory Exerci&s;es wink at a breach of this Order, but they betray that tru&s;t, which God and their Country have repo&s;ed in them. The milde&s;t Commander mu&s;t make con&s;cience while at home, to pre|&s;erve this Order by a due Execution of Di&s;|cipline on &s;uch as violate it: Otherwi&s;e they will train up Souldiers, who, when called forth to Service, will be prepared, not to obey,
<PB N="24" REF="001016_0025_0FAEEDC715C82FE8">
but mutiny; not to fight, but run, to the reproach of their Leaders, &s;corn of their E|nemies, and ruin of the Publick.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Chri&s;tianity requires that they get their minds arrayed with tho&s;e Chri&s;tian vertues which will qualifie them for the attainment of this End.</HI> The former were external media, the&s;e internal. Let the Souldiers indu&s;try be never &s;o great, his application never &s;o clo&s;e to the outward means, that tend to fit him for Service; yet there are Chri&s;tian ver|tues, without which he will remain unready when the Signal is given, to take the Alarm, and arm for Battel.</P>
<P>Thus the Souldier &s;hould labour after <HI>a Publick Spirit.</HI> That Souldier is unqualified for Service, that can't lay claim to this Orna|ment of the Soul. A private Spirit, under the government of narrow and &s;tingy prin|ciples, is not a Martial Spirit; it is a blemi&s;h to the <HI>Man of War.</HI> This will qua&s;h all ju&s;t hopes of Service from &s;uch: Such will prefer their own private intere&s;t before the com|mon tranquillity: A man of a private Spirit, though very &s;olicitous about the &s;afety of his own Cabbine; yet is little thoughtful for the Welfare of the bottom, in which his all is Embarked. Such a one is not prepared to ven|ture his Life in a generous &amp; hazardous En|terprize for the common Weal. The Souldi|er
<PB N="25" REF="001016_0026_0FAEEDC80A343A78">
therefore mu&s;t labour after a publick Spi|rit; a Spirit to re&s;ent all the calamities, and to be pa&s;&s;ionately concerned for the pro&s;pe|rity of his Country. With this Spirit we find tho&s;e Worthies indued, <HI>Gid on, Baruch, Samp&s;on, Jephthab,</HI> and <HI>David;</HI> and with this <HI>Armour</HI> they came prepared to fight the Lords Battels.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Magnanimity, or Greatne&s;s of Spirit,</HI> is another vertue, which qualifies for Service; &amp; this Chri&s;tianity commands; and the Souldi|er in his pre&s;ent preparations is to &s;eek after. By Magnanimity the Souldier will be quali|fied to engage in any noble and generous at|tempt; and will chu&s;e rather to &s;acrifice his own life, than the publick peace, or his own honour. The truly great &s;pirited Souldier is prepared to bear up again&s;t all the hard|&s;hips of the warme&s;t Service, with an unbro|ken and erect mind; when the Cau&s;e of God and his People &s;hall pre&s;s him into their Service. This Spirit re&s;ted upon good <HI>Nehemi|ah,</HI> when he cried out, as <HI>Neh.</HI> 6. 11. <HI>Shall &s;uch a man as I fly?</HI> This Spirit in&s;pired that noble General, who when de&s;erted by his Army in heat of battel, thus did reprimand them: <HI>Go, &s;ays he, tell the Living that I dy FIGHTING; while I go and report to the Dead, that you live FLYING.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, <HI>True Piety </HI> is a nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tion
<PB N="26" REF="001016_0027_0FAEEDC88F3D2750">
for a Souldier in his preparation for Ser|vice. The pious man, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> will be found mo&s;t ready to engage in the mo&s;t bloody Encounters for the publick defence. Piety will &s;ecure the Souldier the proper protection of Divine Providence; which as an impenetrable helmet will defend him; it inflames the mind with the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;o|lution. Hence we find it the character of the Righteous. <HI>Prov 28. 1. The righteous are as bold as a lyon.</HI> It was by Faith that tho&s;e Wor|thies waxed <HI>valiant in battel, &s;ubdued King|doms, and put to flight armies of Aliens,</HI> in <HI>Heb. 11. 34.</HI> A guilty and defiled Con&s;cience is a bad preparation for Service. Such while under a &s;tupefaction through incon&s;ideration may be fool hardy, but not truly brave and valiant: But once they come to have their eyes opened, and take a view of them&s;elves with re&s;pect to the <HI>future &s;tate;</HI> they will dread their Enemies Artillery as if charged with <HI>hell and damnation:</HI> God, as well as man will appear marching in the Camp to confront them; and no wonder then if their hearts &s;aint, and they turn the back in the day of battel. The&s;e vertues are preparative qualifications. If therefore the Souldier would get ready for Service, he mu&s;t endea|vour to get his mind arrayed with the&s;e, Chri|&s;tianity obliges hereto: And the Camp is
<PB N="27" REF="001016_0028_0FAEEDCC64971890">
not the mo&s;t proper School to learn them in.</P>
<P N="5">5. It requires <HI>a dependance on God for his Ble&s;&s;ing to make all means &s;ucce&s;&s;ful to the de&s;ign|ed end.</HI> The Chri&s;tian in all his wayes ows a deference to God as the fountain and au|thor of all ble&s;&s;ings. It was the Wi&s;e mans advice, <HI>Prov. 3. 6. In all thy ways acknowledge him;</HI> and this the Souldier is bound to in the&s;e his Military Exerci&s;es; and this is done by a dependance on him for a ble&s;&s;ing, that &s;o he may not in vain attend this bu&s;ine&s;s, but may be prepared to fight the battel of the Lord again&s;t the mighty. It is Gods <HI>prerogative</HI> thus to prepare the Souldier. Mi|litary &s;kill, courage, and all other martial ac|compli&s;hments, are his gift; hence <HI>David,</HI> that man of War, does a&s;cribe to God the Glory, <HI>P&s;al. 144. 1. He teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</HI> Without this Divine ble&s;&s;ing, all means will fall &s;hort, &amp; leave the Souldier unready. <HI>They may make bright their Armour, and gather the Shields toge|ther, yet if God rai&s;e not up the Spirits of men,</HI> all will be to no purpo&s;e: The Souldiery will be only fit to adorn and advance their Enemies triumphs. Thus we have con&s;ider|ed the duties of Souldiers at home, or in a time of peace, engaged in the&s;e preparatory Military Exerci&s;es; which duties not barely <HI>moral prudence,</HI> or <HI>&s;tate policy,</HI> but <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI>
