<HEAD>Money the Sinews of Trade.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;tre&s;s and perplexity attend|ing the Trade of the Province in general, but more e&s;pecially this Town, in which is carried on &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s, is now become the common talk of all People: and if &s;omething be not done to &s;upply the Place with a Medium to pa&s;s from man to man in the way of Com|merce, in a little time the Trade will be all a Bartar, or exchanging one Commodity for another, and it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee the va&s;t In|conveniencies and Mi&s;chiefs &s;uch a Trade will be attended with. Men will live by preying upon one another; like the Fi&s;h in the Sea, the greater will devour the le&s;s; the whole Trade will get into a few Hands in a &s;hort time, and the middling &s;ort of People who are the chief Support of any Place, will &s;oon come (many of 'em) to Poverty, and in&s;tead of Supporting Church and State, will become a burden to both. It will appear very plain to any who will but look back a few Years, that our Province Bills i&s;&s;ued out by the Government from time to time, have been very &s;ervicable to the Trade, &amp; have kept it alive, &amp; &s;aved many Families from Ruine; whil&s;t others by their Indu&s;try, &amp; by the help of that Medium (how contemptuou&s;ly &s;oever they may now talk of it) have arrived to very
<PB N="3" REF="003450_0003_0ff84486f0583498">
con&s;iderable E&s;tates, &s;uch as never were known in this Country before it was projected. But now His Excellency the GOVERNOUR is forbid to Emit any more Bills except for the bare Support of the Government from year to year, and that to be drawn in again in a very &s;hort time by a Tax, that it can be little or no Service to the Trade; and there being no pro&s;pect of our having a Silver Medium to pa&s;s among us, and it being impo&s;&s;ible for the People to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ome &s;ort of Money, if it were only to purcha&s;e the Ne|ce&s;&s;aries of Life from day to day; &s;urely it is high time for us to contrive &s;omething to an&s;wer the Ends of Money: Several ways have been propo&s;ed to bring in Silver, but all Attempts that way have proved fruitle&s;s, and thro' the diver&s;ity of Opinions in men, none of tho&s;e Schemes have yet been put in practice: All Men &s;eem to be agreed in the main Point; that &s;omething ought to be done &s;peedily, but the way how, is the grand Que&s;tion before us.</P>
<P>Well then, if this be the Ca&s;e, none &s;urely will blame any Man, who endeavours to &s;ave his Country from the Ruine which threatens it; for be his Performance never &s;o weak, Charity obliges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to ca&s;t a vail on the Im|perfections of others, and to put the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;tructions on their Actions. I am not in&s;en&s;ible that what I am about to propo&s;e, will meet with Oppo&s;ition from, and perhaps be Ridiculed by &s;ome, who
<PB N="4" REF="003450_0004_0ff84488783a5d08">
are out of Trade, and &s;o don't feel the want of Money &s;o much as others: But Mer|chants &amp; Traders who are daily complain|ing of the Difficulties they meet with to carry on their Affairs, are the Men, who I hope and expect will countenance &amp; en|courage this Projection, if they think the thing practicable; if not, I &s;hall never think the wor&s;e of any man for differing from me in opinion, provided he who di&s;approves hereof, do but project &s;omething el&s;e to an&s;|wer the End propo&s;ed. I confe&s;s, I think we do not act like rational Creatures, to lye down &amp; dye, when the means is in our own hands to &s;ave our &s;elves and our Po&s;terity from Ruine. And therefore I have adven|tured to make the following Propo&s;al, and leave it to the Con&s;ideration of my Friends and Neighbours, being firmly per&s;waded, that all E&s;&s;ays made to bring in Silver &s;uffi|cient to an&s;wer the Ends of a Medium of Exchange, will prove ineffectual; and that we &s;hall never have Silver pa&s;s again in Pay|ments, until by going more into Manufactures among our &s;elves, we come to live more In|dependant of others; and that mu&s;t be the Work of &s;ucceeding Generations. I would then propo&s;e as followeth, Viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That a Number of Merchants &amp; Tra|ders, enter into Copartner&s;hip for the I&s;&s;uing out Bills or Notes to circulate in lieu of Mo|ney as a Medium of Exchange, &amp; oblige them|&s;elves to give the &s;ame Credit to the &s;aid Bills
<PB N="5" REF="003450_0005_0ff8448a2d1d9750">
or Notes, as they now do to the Bills I&s;&s;ued out by the Government.</P>
<P N="2">2. In order to gain the &s;aid Notes Credit with others, what if the Partners concerned &s;hould oblige them&s;elves not to deal with or buy of any (no more than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary) who will not accept the &s;aid Bills or Notes in Payment on equal terms with the Province Bills? This will doubtle&s;s gain the Bills a Univer&s;al Credit, and make 'em as Current as the Province Bills in a very &s;hort time: For if but One Hundred Men of Trade, and any con&s;iderable Bu&s;ine&s;s in this Town, &s;hould engage in &s;uch a manner, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for any Man in the Place to carry on his Affairs without being concerned with &s;ome of tho&s;e Partners.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Medium &s;o i&s;&s;ued out be im|proved at Intere&s;t and no otherways. This hath been formerly objected again&s;t a pri|vate Bank, that the Bankers will monopolize particular Commodities, and &s;o hurt their Neighbours in their Trade; tho' I confe&s;s I never could &s;ee any weight in that Argument: but by this Article I think that Objection is an&s;wered.</P>
<P N="4">4. That no Money or Bills be let out by the Bank but on a &s;ufficient Security. Now nothing can be &s;afer than a Land Security: The Earth endures for ever: all other things are more uncertain, more liable to ca&s;ualties and accidents: And indeed had we Gold and Silver among us, which we have not,
<PB N="6" REF="003450_0006_0ff8448bb8cbcf68">
there would be more danger of their falling in value, than there is of our Lands falling in value: But had we Gold &amp; Silver, there would not be occa&s;ion for a Land Bank, or any other at pre&s;ent; but it is the want of &s;uch a Medium, obliges us to this Method; and no doubt whoever are the Directors and Managers, will take care the Lands which are put in for Securities are not over-valued.</P>
<P N="5">5. That for the ea&s;e &amp; &s;afety of Trade, and to prevent Counterfeits, People may keep their Ca&s;h at the Bank, &amp; may have Cre|dit in the Books, for what they leave there, and &s;o may draw Notes on the Bank for whatever is due to them, payable on demand, to whom&s;oever they are Indebted. And cer|tainly nothing can be &s;o &s;hort; ea&s;y, and &s;afe, as this way of Negotiating Payments by the Bank; &amp; this makes all the World fond of them: (for 1.) If a man hath Stock in the Bank, he may Sell and Transfer his Stock to his Creditor, and buy again of o|thers who want to Sell, whenever he is mind|ed to be concerned; for this will &s;oon be|come as common as to Buy and Sell any Merchandize. (2.) If a man receive a Note of hand from his Debtor, payable in two or three Months, if his pre&s;ent occa&s;ions call for the Money, it is but going to the Bank and Indor&s;ing his Note, and they will let him have the Money, allowing the Di&s;count, and when it becomes due, they will &s;end the Note to the Drawer and receive it; if he
<PB N="7" REF="003450_0007_0ff8448dd25a22a8">
refu&s;e to pay it, it is carried to the Indor&s;er, and he pays it; what a mighty advantage and conveniency is here. The Drawer hath paid his Debt to his Creditor, the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ions of him who received the Note is an&s;|wered; the Bank gains the Intere&s;t of the Mo|ney, &amp; is &s;afe, having both the Drawer and Indor&s;er of the Note for Security, it &s;hortens Credit, makes every body ea&s;y, and who that hath &s;uch a Note, would not allow the Intere&s;t of the Money to have the improve|ment thereof; and thus it will be with re&s;|pect to foreign Bills; as &s;oon as a man hath got his Bill accepted, if he wants the Money, he will go &amp; leave it Indor&s;t with the Bank, and take his Money, allowing the Di&s;count, and he may have his Money to an&s;wer his pre&s;ent occa&s;ions. (3.) It will be a means to &s;horten Credit, which is a burthen the Trade at pre&s;ent groans under, &amp; which will ever attend a Truck Trade: Men are kept out of their Money unrea&s;onably; the pre|tence in the mouths of every body being, there is no Money &s;tirring, and by this pre|tence they weary out their Creditors, and even oblige them to draw Notes on them to their great di&s;advantage; and this puts it in the power, and I wi&s;h their Debtors do not too often make u&s;e of &s;uch opportunities to opre&s;s their Neighbours in their payments; but this Method of a Bank will take away that pretence, and it will &s;oon appear who trade with their own, and who with the E|&s;tates
<PB N="8" REF="003450_0008_0ff84490927524b8">
of others. (4.) By a mans keeping his Ca&s;h at the Bank, he &s;aves the Ri&s;que of Fire and Thieves, and yet it is as ready to an&s;wer his occa&s;ions, as if it were in his own hou&s;e; this is a common Cu&s;tom in <HI>London,</HI> if a man be going a Journey into the Country but for a fortnight, he will carry his Ca&s;h to the Bank, and take a Receipt for it, accounting it &s;afer than in his own Hou&s;e, &amp; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eady to an&s;wer his occa&s;ions. (5.) If a man be bound a Voyage to Sea, and have Money he don't improve with him, he can't leave it no where &s;o &s;afe as in the Bank, he may at his Return receive it at a days warn|ing, or if he &s;end an Order for it from abroad, at will be always ready on demand; where|as if he leave it in the hands of private per|&s;ons, he may meet with many lets and hin|drances in his way to obtain it, either by the death of the per&s;on he left it with, or by their having met with Misfortunes, and being thereby rendred uncapable to pay.</P>
<P N="6">6. That what lo&s;&s;es may happen by ill people counterfeiting the Bills or Notes, &s;hall be made good to the &s;ufferers out of the Profits; this will make the Bank Bills preferr'd before the Province Bills, for all men &s;eek to improve their E&s;tates in &s;uch ways, which they apprehend lea&s;t Ri&s;que, &amp; the Ri&s;que men run of receiving Counterfeits I am of opinion, hath been a means of &s;ink|ing the value of our Province Bills: This is a common complaint among even Mer|chants,
<PB N="9" REF="003450_0009_0ff84492acbfb428">
who are mo&s;t conver&s;ant among&s;t them, that they know not but great part of them may be Counterfeits, &amp; therefore are de&s;irous to be rid of them again, as &s;oon as they can conveniently, lea&s;t there &s;hould happen a lo&s;s on them; but if there be any inconveniencies attending our Province Bills in this re&s;pect, how great is it with re&s;pect to the Bills of other Provinces; our own Bills are &s;igned by Gentlemen well known to us, and our Neighbours to whom we can in&s;tantly apply our &s;elves, on the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any Bill to know whether they &s;igned it or no; but if we receive Counterfeits of the Bills of the other Provinces, the Signers live &s;o Remote, that we can't come at them, &amp; this makes our own Bills preferr'd by us before theirs, and were there a &s;ufficiency of our own to carry on the Trade, I que&s;tion whether men would receive the others in payment; but the nece&s;&s;ity of the times is &s;uch, that men are glad to catch at any thing that hath but the name of Money, if it will but pa&s;s away again, and &s;o an&s;wer their pre&s;ent occa&s;ions in buying, or to pay their Debts; but here the Bank obliging them&s;elves to make good the Counterfeits, the Recei|vers of the Bills will be ea&s;y, becau&s;e &s;afe on that head, and this will certainly make the Bank Bills e&s;teemed and valued above the Province Bills. I believe all men will joyn with me in this, That if a Bank of
<PB N="10" REF="003450_0010_0ff8449491d5faa0">
<HI>One hunded Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> be made in this way, the Province is &s;o much the rich|er for it: whereas all Bills i&s;&s;ued out by the Government are a Debt due from 'em, and mu&s;t terminate &s;ooner or later: and therefore the Province is not one far|thing the richer for them; indeed the Profits ari&s;ing by &s;uch a Bank will come to the Founders of the Bank, and &s;uch others as in time may come to be concerned there|in; yet I &s;ay the Province is the Richer, becau&s;e there is &s;o much the more Money in it, and the Province not Indebted any thing for it, neither is any private man hurt who borrows of the Bank, any more than he is by borrowing Money of any private per&s;on, &s;ince the Bank Bills an&s;wer his oc|ca&s;ions in all re&s;pects as much as the other; and as to the Bankers, if any begrutch 'em the profit, it mu&s;t proceed from Envy, for no man is hurt by it, Trade is ea&s;ed, every man &s;erved, and the Province in general, as well as private men &s;erved, and gain by it.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but ob&s;erve how tho't|le&s;s and Indolent we are about our Trade, on the flouri&s;hing whereof our worldly happine&s;s &s;o much depends: How have our Neighbours at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> a &s;mall Government, a handful of people, if com|pared with us, eat us out of it. It is but a few years &s;ince they were &s;upplied from hence with almo&s;t every thing, but we by burthening Trade with heavy Duties, drove
<PB N="11" REF="003450_0011_0ff8449899bf6288">
it away to them &amp; other places; they wi&s;ely &s;aw it, and cheri&s;ht their Trade, by making every thing ea&s;y to the Importer, and continue &s;o to do, and now &s;upply us with many things they u&s;ed to buy of us; nay, to our &s;hame be it &s;poken, we are &s;up|ply'd by them with great, if not the great|e&s;t part of the Medium of Exchange now pa&s;&s;ing among us; and they now talk of Emitting a large Sum more, whil&s;t we &s;it idle and unconcern'd, every man's tho'ts being taken up, how he &s;hall advance his own private Intere&s;t, none &s;eeking the com|mon good of the Community; were we not both dependant Governments, Subjects to one and the &s;ame Prince, they would &s;oon become the Head, and we the Tail, &amp; as they find us Money, would give us Laws al&s;o. Surely no man can think but the Me|thod here propo&s;ed, will be much &s;afer &amp; better for us than their Bills, or the Bills of any of the other Governments: That the <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Bills &s;hould be accepted by us in payment &s;eems &s;trange, when we know that many of 'em are counterfeits, and that no Bills but our own will an&s;wer for Spe|cialties, or in any publick payments; but the nece&s;&s;ity of the Times is &s;uch, that for want of a &s;ufficient Medium of our own to buy with, theirs are become as currant as ours, &amp; will buy any thing on equal terms with our Province Bills; would any people but we, &s;uffer our &s;elves to be thus u&s;ed;
<PB N="12" REF="003450_0012_0ff8449a21eb0b60">
what can be more di&s;honourable to us, and how ea&s;y is it for us to put a &s;top to this E|vil; it is but for us to unite among our &s;elves, and refu&s;e to take their Bills, the bu&s;ine&s;s is done at once, &amp; the Bank here propo&s;ed may &s;upply its place. And now I am upon this head, let me mention another Evil we are fal|ling into, which will in the end prove more pernicious to us than any thing that hath ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> befallen us; tho&s;e People now let out their Money at Intere&s;t to our Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple of this Pro|ince, &amp; pay 'em in the Bills of their Province, &amp; take their Bonds to pay again in the Bills of our Province, &amp; an exorbitant Intere&s;t al&s;o, and avoid as much as may be the re|ceiving their own Bills in payment for the Goods they &s;ell us, chu&s;ing as any wi&s;e men wou'd, to lay up our Province Bills: Who can be &s;o blind as not to &s;ee their drift in this matter; they know that nothing but our Province Bills, will an&s;wer for the Bonds and Mortgages made to the Government, nor indeed for tho&s;e made to private per&s;ons, if the Mortgagee will in&s;i&s;t on it; &amp; I pre&s;ume no body thinks there are near enough of our Province Bills abroad to di&s;charge tho&s;e Bonds and Mortgages: Well then, our only Remedy is, we mu&s;t go to <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> &amp; give tho&s;e people what advance they are plea&s;ed to ask, for our Province Bills to an|&s;wer tho&s;e Occa&s;ions. But &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Rhode-I&s;landers</HI> &s;hould come into a private Bank, as they begin to talk they will, if their Go|verment
<PB N="13" REF="003450_0013_0ff8449bac03cab0">
do not &s;upply 'em in a publick way, &amp; &s;uppo&s;e that their Bills &s;hould gain a currency a|mong us, as they doubtle&s;s will in a very little time; for mens nece&s;&s;ities will bring 'em to take 'em; what then will be the con&s;equence, in a few years great part of this Government will be Mortgaged to them; which puts me in mind of what I have heard &s;ome of 'em &s;ay in a way of deri&s;ion, if you'l find us good Security, you &s;hall not want Money; may I not then very properly &s;ay, we are &s;elling our &s;elves to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and &s;hall &s;ee our Error, and repent when it is too late to remedy it; it's certain that we by gi|ving a currency to their Bills, have made them Rich in a few Years. But &s;ome will an&s;wer me, that if we refu&s;e their Bills, they will do the &s;ame by our's. To that I an&s;wer, Did we &s;tand in the &s;ame need of them that they do of us, there would be &s;ome weight in that Objection; but the Ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e: What would they do with all their Molo&s;&s;es, Sugar, Logwood, &amp; other Goods they purcha&s;e abroad, if it were not for our Market. How many Thou&s;ands of Pounds in Money do they carry from hence to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> every year for the&s;e Commodities; do they not order their Ships abroad, to come direct to this Port, for want of a Market for them in their own Government: and yet we tamely &s;uffer 'em to make Bills, &amp; &s;upply the Trading Men therewith, and they pay 'em into the Trea&s;ury, as I am in|formed, Ten per Cent. for Ten Years, that &s;a|tisfies both for Principal &amp; Intere&s;t. With this Money they fitted out at lea&s;t Thirty Sail of Ve&s;|&s;els for Martineco, Surranam, Jamaica, &amp; our Le|ward I&s;lands, bring their Molo&s;&s;es, Sugar, &amp; other Goods from tho&s;e Places direct hither. Here they fell them for ready Money, &amp; carry it away to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI>; this keeps their Trade going to
<PB N="14" REF="003450_0014_0ff8449d35a575a0">
the be&s;t advantage, while for want of that Mo|ney our Trade langui&s;hes, &amp; labours under the greate&s;t difficulties; whereas if we had not given their Bills a Currency, but had made a private Bank among our &s;elves, the advantages they have reapt by the Trade abovementioned, would have fallen mo&s;tly into our own Hands. Thus for want of a good harmony &amp; agreement among our &s;elves, we have given the Bread out of our own mouths and enrich'd them; who now di&s;pi&s;e us for &s;o do|ing. And indeed, all indefferent Men will con|demn us for our ill Conduct in &s;uffering our &s;elves to be thus bubbled by them. I am well inform|ed, that they are now de&s;igning to Emit <HI>One Hun|dred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> more, with which they de|&s;ign to go upon the Cod &amp; Whale Fi&s;hery, and upon Manufacturing their own Wool; &amp; tho&s;e who will improve it in the&s;e ways, it is propo&s;ed &s;hall have the Money, giving Security in Lands for what they receive, to pay it into their Trea&s;ury in Twenty Years, viz. Five per Cent. per Annum in Siver at 15 s. per Ounce, and that is to &s;atisfy for the Principal &amp; Intere&s;t; if this will not awaken us out of the Lethargy we &s;eem to be fallen in|to, &amp; make us be&s;tir our &s;elves, &s;urely nothing will.</P>
<P>But &s;ome men are of Opinion that we in this Province &s;hall refu&s;e accepting tho&s;e Bills, &amp; &s;o their Project will &s;ink, as indeed it certainly will if we refu&s;e to accept them in Payments: But I can't &s;ee any rea&s;on why we &s;hould refu&s;e tho&s;e Bills any more than what they have now out, they will be as good as what they have now pa&s;|&s;ing, and that day they make their new Emi&s;&s;ion, they will certainly be received by us, as freely as the others; the nece&s;&s;ities of the times will even force men to take 'em; and I can &s;ee no way to prevent it but by making a Bank among our&s;elves. But it is the opinion of many that this will be op|pos'd

by &s;ome among us who have Bonds &amp; Mort|gages, which mu&s;t be redeemed they will &s;ay with our Province Bills, or in Silver at Seventeen penny weight for <HI>&s;ix &s;hillings,</HI> and they &s;ee that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to get our Bills, to an&s;wer tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, &amp; con&s;equently that their Neigh|bours E&s;tates will fall into their hands for much le&s;s than the value of them. But will any man who calls him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian be &s;o cruel &amp; un|ju&s;t to take that advantage, &amp; allowing that there are &s;ome &s;uch People who would take &s;uch an advantage of their Neighbours, <HI>which I would charitably &s;uppo&s;e, very few would</HI>; can it be ima|gined that the Government will &s;uffer &s;uch an ill u&s;e to be made of what was de&s;igned by them for a common good, in making tho&s;e Bills, and letting 'em out to the people in order to &s;ave them from Ruine; No, &s;uch men, (if any &s;uch there be) will mo&s;t certainly be di&s;appointed in their Ex|pectations, &amp; the Government will contrive &s;ome way to prevent &s;uch a piece of Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly if &s;omething be not done, and that without delay, many People will be Ruined, for tho&s;e who have their E&s;tates Mortgaged are ga|thering up the Bills of this Province to Redeem them, and indeed the time is &s;o near expired in which they are to pay their Money into the Trea|&s;ury, that it highly concerns 'em to prepare for it. And as I hinted before the <HI>Rhode-I&s;landers</HI> are hoarding 'em up, in order to make a Prey of us. The&s;e things in a little time will leave us few or none of our own Province Bills abroad. Surely then the&s;e Con&s;iderations &s;hould unite us, &amp; make us joyn heart &amp; hand in bringing forward this, or contriving &s;omething el&s;e which may extricate us out of our Difficulties.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude without &s;aying this word, if &s;omething be not done, what will become of
<PB N="16" REF="003450_0016_0ff844a298f37b50">
the Ri&s;ing Generation? how is it po&s;&s;ible that they entring upon the Stage of Action, unexpe|rienced &s;hould carry on a truck Trade, unle&s;s they have very large Stocks to begin with, which very few have, (for what have the be&s;t men in the place to boa&s;t of that was left 'em by their Fathers: Their E&s;tates were &s;mall to what their Children have attained to, and every man of any con&s;iderable Intere&s;t among us, his E&s;tate hath been got by him&s;elf or Father &s;ince the Paper Medium was projected;) and again, every Young man hath not a head turned to manage a truck Trade; It requires a plodding head, application, diligence, and indu&s;try, &amp; great caution &amp; circum&s;pection, that they are not over-reacht by the Crafty; he that hath his Money or Bills to buy with, hath a far better chance by going &amp; trying the Market every where; whereas he that deals but in a few Com|modities, is obliged to buy of them, &amp; them only, who want the Commodities he deals in; and in &s;uch a ca&s;e the Seller always hath the advantage of the man who comes to buy of him, and it is very much in his power to &s;et the price of his Chap-mans Goods as well as his own; &s;urely this Con&s;ideration ought to have its weight with us, for we are but Stewards for our Children, &amp; mu&s;t in a little time go off the Stage, &amp; it is our duty as far as we are able, to leave things &s;o circum&s;tan|ced, that they may be able to improve what by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven we leave them.</P>
<P>If what I have offered may be of Service, or if others are led into more ju&s;t &amp; proper tho'ts, I &s;hall be very glad, for I would not be tho't fond of my own notions, but am very de&s;irous to &s;ee &s;omething put on foot, which may give us a pro&s;|pect of things coming to Rights again in the days of our Children, for I &s;ee little pro&s;pect of it in our days.</P>
