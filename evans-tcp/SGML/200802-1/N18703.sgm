<HEAD>A DISCOURSE UPON THE PUBLIC WORSHIP OF GOD.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is the profe&s;&s;ed bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the pre&s;ent &s;olem|nity, to DEDICATE THIS HOUSE to the honor and Service of the Everla&s;ting GOD&mdash;a cu&s;tom &s;anction|ed by the friends of piety, from the earlie&s;t ages of the Church&mdash;And to tho&s;e who engage in it, with &s;uitable views of the Object, and a proper

temper of mind, it will yield a mo&s;t rational and &s;ublime plea&s;ure&mdash;A croud of the mo&s;t augu&s;t and tran&s;porting ideas ru&s;h upon the &s;oul, at the very mention of a hou&s;e on earth, wherein the God of heaven will deign to hear the prayers, and give an&s;wers of peace to mortal men.</P>
<P>HENCE we find, when God made known his gracious intention of having an hou&s;e built, wherein he might record his name and manife&s;t his glory to his people, the king's, David and Solomon, were filled with plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;and, like the three di&s;ciples on the mount of transfiguration, they &s;carce knew in which regi|on they were, whether in heaven or on earth.</P>
<P>WHEN Solomon had completed the temple, and was about to invoke the Divine Pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing, the greatne&s;s of &s;uch an honor and favor, nearly overwhelmed his pious mind; he &s;taggered at the promi&s;e&mdash;In the entrance of his prayer, he he&s;itates&mdash;After he had &s;aid, O God of I&s;rael, let thy word, I pray thee, which thou &s;paked&s;t unto thy &s;ervant David, of dwelling in this hou&s;e, be verified! Here he checks him&s;elf&mdash;But will GOD, in very deed, dwell on earth!
<PB N="7" REF="024283_0005_0FC5E92A2A9CA160">
The Heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee! much le&s;s this hou&s;e!</P>
<P>THE manife&s;tation of the Divine perfections and pre&s;ence, is, to the pious, the dawn of hea|ven. This is the principal &s;ource of happine&s;s to angels in heaven, and men on earth.</P>
<P>To exhibit the glory of God to mankind, and render them happy in it, is one grand de|&s;ign of all the religious in&s;titutions of God in our world. The Jewish oeconomy, with all its expen&s;ive &s;acrifices&mdash;the incarnation of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;the promulgation and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his religion&mdash;all concur to carry into effect this gracious de&s;ign.</P>
<P>AND the temple, the hou&s;e of God, and the church, meaning, in general, but one thing, is the peculiar place, in which he has, hitherto, made the fulle&s;t di&s;play of this glory.</P>
<P>AND what, my hearers, was your profe&s;&s;ed object, in erecting this elegant hou&s;e, wherein you are now a&s;&s;embled? Was it not for the glo|ry of God, and to promote the pre&s;ent and fu|ture happine&s;s of your&s;elves and children? If &s;incere, it is an honorable intention. This is to be co-workers with Chri&s;t. This is well-doing.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024283_0006_0FC5E9315D3831B0">
BUT all is not yet done. This hou&s;e cannot &s;ave us. In vain did the people of I&s;rael cry, The temple of the Lord, while they pretended to wor&s;hip God in that temple, without &s;uitable views of him or them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WHAT pity, that they &s;hould lo&s;e their la|bour, lo&s;e the ble&s;&s;ing, and the temple, and lo&s;e their own &s;ouls, by not wor&s;hipping in a &s;uitable manner, in the hou&s;e built for that very purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>IF we would avoid their unhappy fate, we mu&s;t avoid that temper, expunge that leaven of hypocri&s;y that foamed in their wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>IF we have built this hou&s;e for the glory of God, and to prepare our&s;elves and children for heavenly happine&s;s, let us carefully pur&s;ue the&s;e important objects.</P>
<P>AND, ble&s;&s;ed be God, he has pointed out the way by which we may a&s;&s;uredly obtain them.</P>
<P>KING DAVID, who fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of building an hou&s;e to the Lord, has al&s;o given particular directions how to behave in it, &s;o as to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es above hinted at.</P>
<P>THAT method of wor&s;hip is recorded in the ninety-&s;ixth P&s;alm and ninth ver&s;e, and In&s;cri|bed in Letters of Gold, con&s;picuou&s;ly placed

<P>LET us conform to this, and the de&s;ign of erecting this hou&s;e will be accompli&s;hed, to our un&s;peakable gain; and will be a better dedica|tion of it, than the offering of thou&s;ands of oxen and rivers of oil.</P>

<P><PB N="10" REF="024283_0008_0FC5E934A9D56D48">
I am fir&s;t to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the act of public wor&s;hip: and this con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal parts: &amp; prai&s;e may be fir&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>I. PRAISE has reference to God as the &s;ource of being, perfection and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; the Au|thor and Be&s;tower of all favors, and as having already communicated his goodne&s;s. So fully are his eternal power and greatne&s;s exhibited in the works of nature and providence, that the very heathen, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the light of divine re|velation, are inexcu&s;ably guilty, if they neglect to &s;ee and glorify him. And if they are inex|cu&s;able in neglecting to pay this tribute of ho|mage, much more criminal mu&s;t tho&s;e be, to whom are committed the lively oracles of God, and yet neglect this duty of prai&s;e, when thus doubly enforced.</P>
<P>WE find the wi&s;e&s;t of men, when dedicating the temple, founding the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of its wor&s;hip upon this well-known principle. Be|hold the heaven and the heaven of heavens can|not contain thee: and, there is no God like unto thee, who keepe&s;t covenant and mercy for thy &s;er|vants&mdash;And the angels in heaven, that world
<PB N="11" REF="024283_0009_0FC5E93797F73930">
of vi&s;ion, perform their con&s;tant wor&s;hip upon the &s;ame principle. Hence we are informed, that all the heavenly ho&s;ts join, with one accord, "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou King of &s;aints." And a multitude of the hea|venly ho&s;ts prai&s;ed God, at the Saviour's birth. The mercy and good-will of God, made known thereby, gave occa&s;ion for new and nobler ac|cents to their angelic hallelujahs.</P>
<P>So, prai&s;ing God, in his hou&s;e, is the neare&s;t approach men on earth can make, to the temper' the employment, and the plea&s;ure that now cir|culates round the hearts of the happy millions in heaven, while tuning their harps to the &s;ong of Mo&s;es and the Lamb.</P>
<P>SINGING the prai&s;es of God has a powerful tendency to &s;often, &s;mooth and poli&s;h the rough|er feelings of our nature&mdash;it animates every part of wor&s;hip; it creates, and leaves on the mind a reli&s;h for the &s;acred employment, and gives a heavenly turn and elevation to the whole &s;oul.</P>
<P>LET the well-&s;killed mu&s;ical band glory in acting well their part, as &s;uch important and de|lightful
<PB N="12" REF="024283_0010_0FC5E93F013B4EC0">
effects attend the grace and power of their mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>ANOTHER part of publick wor&s;hip is, Se|condly, Prayer. The foundation of prayer, is' our entire dependence upon God, his infinite fulne&s;s and &s;ufficiency, and our poverty and want. It is the making known our de&s;ires to him in the name of Chri&s;t for things agreeable to his will. He has &s;tiled him&s;elf a prayer hearing God. And has graciou&s;ly proclaimed him&s;elf the Parent and Saviour of mankind. And that he has all po&s;&s;ible ble&s;&s;ings on hand&mdash;we need either for body or &s;oul, time or eterni|ty.</P>
<P>AND be it remembered,</P>
<P>HE has al&s;o proclaimed, that he will be &s;ought unto, by his creatures for the be&s;towment of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. What a privilege! That &s;uch indigent feeble creatures, who are &s;urrounded all the way through life with numberle&s;s dan|gers, and attacked with complicated afflictions, every moment expo&s;ed to the in&s;atiable ravages of death and the grave and the mi&s;eries of hell. What a privilege, that we may warrantably
<PB N="13" REF="024283_0011_0FC5E9424C9D7E00">
come to the hou&s;e of God, and pray with the greate&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, deliverance from &s;ome, &s;upport under others; and that all may ope|rate together to purge off the dregs of &s;in, and &s;o work out for us an exceeding and eternal weight of glory! None &s;hall &s;eek the Lord in vain.</P>
<P>AND Solomon's prayer, made at the dedicati|on of the temple greatly corroborates this &s;enti|ment. It may be con&s;idered as a prophe&s;y of what God would do for his &s;incere wor&s;hippers in all ages.</P>
<P>THE eyes of the Lord are open toward his hou&s;e, night and day, where his name is, that he may hear the prayers and &s;upplications made in it by all people; and he will hear and forgive&mdash;This, then, is the place more e&s;pecially pointed out to obtain relief under all common difficul|ties. When our land is invaded by enemies, and we are &s;mitten before them, to the hou&s;e of God may we repair, confe&s;&s;ing our &s;ins, and praying, When heaven is &s;hut up, and there is no rain, this is the place to obtain relief&mdash;if pin|ched, for want of bread&mdash;if pe&s;tilence, bla&s;ting
<PB N="14" REF="024283_0012_0FC5E943B6451100">
and mildew&mdash;in a word, if any plague or &s;ick|ne&s;s di&s;tre&s;s us, and cau&s;e mourning, the hou&s;e of God and prayer, are the appointed re&s;ort for relief.</P>
<P>AND, as under the darker di&s;pen&s;ation, pray|er might be made by all manner of people for all temporal ble&s;&s;ings, with the greate&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, if properly qualified: So under the more glorious di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, the greate&s;t &s;piritual and everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;ings may be prayed for with equal probability of &s;ucce&s;s. A&s;k, and ye &s;hall receive, knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you, &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find. Where two or three are met together in my name there am I in the mid&s;t of them!</P>
<P>AND with more readine&s;s than the fond parent will give a mor&s;el of bread to the hungry child that a&s;keth it, will I give the holy &s;pirit to them who &s;eek his aid. And in our pre&s;ent mode of exi&s;tence. We can neither a&s;k or receive a great|er ble&s;&s;ing. If we obtain and po&s;&s;e&s;s this, we virtually po&s;&s;e&s;s all things in life and death, gui|ded by the &s;pirit that came forth from the living God, we &s;hall infallibly be led finally to a uni|on
<PB N="15" REF="024283_0013_OFC5E9452AD40CEO">
with Deity. This is as great a ble&s;&s;ing as can be enjoyed, and greater than can be comprehended&mdash;was not bought with corruptible things, &s;uch as &s;ilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God. Kings and Emperors can grant no &s;uch favors; all they can give, all they po&s;&s;e&s;s, is tra&s;h, compared to this. It is not, however, to be expected, but by waiting upon the Author and Be&s;tower of every good and perfect gift in prayer.&mdash;<HI>Then</HI> the Lord o|pened the under&s;tandings of the di&s;ciples; even when they were met together. True indeed he is not confined to this mountain, nor Jeru&s;alem, nor any particular place. But as yet in his in|finite wi&s;dom, he hath not &s;een fit to <HI>fill</HI> any place on earth with his glory, except his temple, his hou&s;e. Here his &s;aving power hath been &s;een and felt.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e and wor&s;hip of God are the &s;chool and nur&s;ery, where we and our children may more e&s;pecially be taught the language, the temper and employment of heaven. We &s;hall not begin to love these devotional exerci&s;es, in that &s;tate of perfection. The beginning mu&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="024283_0014_0FC5E946F4841780">
be made in the lower &s;chool, in God's earthly court. Our prayers, indeed, will cea&s;e in heav|en, becau&s;e our dangers will be at an end, and our wants be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER exerci&s;e, is, preaching &amp; hearing the word of God. Hereby the duties men owe to their Creator, to each other, and them|&s;elves, are made known, and enforced. The na|ture and con&s;equences of &s;in, the danger, folly and mi&s;ery of it, evinced.&mdash;Life and immortali|ty &s;et before us, with the conditions and motives, by which we may all become partakers of the heavenly inheritance; and the work of grace, be perfected in the hearts of the penitent, unto the day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT then it mu&s;t be the word of God, quick, and powerful, &s;harper than any two edged &s;word, piercing to the dividing a&s;under the &s;oul and &s;pirit, and of the joints and marrow, a di&s;cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. For in vain, &s;aith the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, do men wor&s;hip me, teaching for doctrines, the com|mandments of men.</P>
<P N="4">4. Bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, are al&s;o parts of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="024283_0015_0FC5E94CA83DD1A0">
BY the one, we are initiated into the vi&s;ible kingdom of Chri&s;t&mdash;declared to be members of his family&mdash;Candidates for heaven. And our feeble helple&s;s offspring committed to the faith|ful Shepherd's care.</P>
<P>BY the other, we &s;hew forth the Lord's death; until he come the &s;econd time, and receive an earne&s;t of the paradi&s;e of God. The&s;e are the &s;everal parts which con&s;titute the general act of public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>BUT as the form profiteth but little, without the power&mdash;this wor&s;hip mu&s;t be performed in the beauty of holine&s;s. This is the direction of the text&mdash;and the qualification of its acceptibi|lity&mdash;and is now to be attended to under the &s;econd general head.</P>
<P>II. To wor&s;hip the Lord in the beauty of holine&s;s, undoubtedly has reference both to the <HI>object</HI>
and <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>I. As to the object, it is the Lord in the <HI>beauty</HI> of <HI>holine&s;s</HI>&mdash;Or God manife&s;t in and by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;The ble&s;&s;ed God po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all po&s;|&s;ible perfection: nor are there any new excellen|cies derived to him, from any of his works or creatures, through their infinite variety.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="024283_0016_0FC5E950A00A54E0">
But the&s;e uncreated excellencies and beau|ties, may not all be exhibited at one time, or in one work.</P>
<P>HENCE, it is &s;aid, his eternal power and God|head are clearly &s;een by the things that are made, plainly implying that other divine perfec|tions are more fully exhibited el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>His ju&s;tice&mdash;faithfulne&s;s&mdash;goodne&s;s&mdash;his love to the human race&mdash;and his aver&s;ion from &s;in, are manife&s;ted to us in the method of redemption.</P>
<P>The beauty of holine&s;s and the glory of the Load are &s;ynonimous terms. God has declared that his glory con&s;i&s;teth in his being the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful, &s;low to anger, and abundant in goodne&s;s Keeping mer|cy for thou&s;ands, and yet by no means clearing the guilty&mdash;waiting upon &s;inners in order to be gracious to them&mdash;taking delight in be|&s;towing happine&s;s upon tho&s;e whom ju&s;tice had &s;entenced to mi&s;ery&mdash;giving life to tho&s;e whom the law had condemned to death. God appears beautiful in holine&s;s, in being infinitely remov|ed from every &s;pecies of iniquity&mdash;in being in|capale of admitting an unclean thing into his
<PB N="19" REF="024283_0017_0FC5E952B0DCE940">
pre&s;ence: And yet, through the mediation of his Son, admitting the mo&s;t unworthy of penitent &s;inners, to a participation of his own holy na|ture: And this in a way, &s;o far from being derogatory to his ju&s;tice and truth, that the highe&s;t glory &s;hall accrue to God from this ve|ry act: for, while this heavenly peace and good-will are exerci&s;ed toward men, in this way, glo|ry is given to God in the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>Now, as the righteou&s;ne&s;s, truth and ju&s;|tice of God&mdash;his infinite abhorrence of &s;in, are awfully displayed, and fully vindicated by the mediation of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and as re|demption from mi&s;ery, pardon of &s;in, a commu|nication of the divine nature, and endle&s;s hap|pine&s;s, can be freely granted to men, through the &s;ame medium, and all this be confirmed, ra|tified and &s;ealed to believers by the oath of God and the blood of Chri&s;t, and God more ready to perform all this for us than we are to &s;eek, and receive it&mdash;<HI>This</HI> may be termed the <HI>beauty of holine&s;s.</HI> But this illu&s;trious and tran&s;|cendent di&s;play God makes of him&s;elf more e&s;pecially in his temple, in his earthly court.&mdash;
<PB N="20" REF="024283_0018_0FC5E9555F02C820">
So that if the awful &s;plendors of inflexible and eternal ju&s;tice, the maje&s;ty of invariable truth, united and my&s;teriou&s;ly blending and mingling with the mea&s;urele&s;s ocean of redeeming love and mercy, may be called the beauty of holi|ne&s;s, the glory of the Divine character&mdash;Then to have this view of God, in his hou&s;e, in the &s;everal parts of wor&s;hip, is to wor&s;hip him in the beauty of holine&s;s. This is one important qua|lification of wor&s;hipping God, as <HI>above</HI> direct|ed. It is this view of the Lord that fills the brea&s;ts of millions of &s;aints and angels with admiration and joy. It was this VIEW OF THE LORD made David cry out, "how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of ho&s;ts." This view of God it was, made the Sabbath and &s;anctuary &s;o welcome to his &s;oul. To Contemplate, to love to prai&s;e and pray to a being thus glorious in holine&s;s, made his pious &s;oul faint with longing to go up to the court of the Lord&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed are they that dwell in thy hou&s;e they will be &s;till prai&s;ing thee."</P>
<P>THIS &s;ame beauty of holine&s;s, was, of old, &s;hadowed forth in the &s;anctuary. The ark was
<PB N="21" REF="024283_0019_0FC5E9566C3F0AA8">
the token of the Divine Maje&s;ty, containing the law. The mercy-&s;eat entirely covered the ark. On this mercy-&s;eat, God promi&s;ed to meet Mo|&s;es, and commune with him, and be intreated by him. At each end of this mercy-&s;eat, a che|rubim &s;tood with out-&s;tretched wings, looking at each other, and looking upon the mercy-&s;eat, admiring and a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;<HI>Exod.</HI> xxv. 17, 22.&mdash;This mercy-&s;eat repre&s;ented, and the benevolent cherubims &s;aw, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who, by his atonement, covered our &s;ins, and bore the cur&s;e of the law, for our &s;akes, that God might look on the law through him, as fullfilled on our behalf: By whom God is reconcilling and uniting a lo&s;t world to him&s;elf; in whom he will meet us, and commune with us, "through whom we may come boldly to the throne of grace, a&s;k mercy, and find grace to help us in every need."</P>
<P>THIS is the glory! this the beauty of holi|ne&s;s, in which the Divine Being exhibiteth him&s;elf to us as the object of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>But to wor&s;hip God in the beauty of holine&s;s, has reference to the temper and views of the
<PB N="22" REF="024283_0020_0FC5E95B9D1B4B40">
<HI>&s;ubject,</HI> as well as to the excellencies of the ob|ject.</P>
<P>"God is a &s;pirit, and tho&s;e who wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t do it in &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tand|ing."</P>
<P>OUR temper and views, will, undoubtedly, be right in all parts of wor&s;hip, when in union with the divine character as above de&s;cribed.&mdash;And this will be wor&s;hipping in the beauty of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT this includes &s;everal particulars: As</P>
<P>I. Submi&s;&s;ion to the Divine Being.</P>
<P>THE public wor&s;hip of God, is a duty made known and enforced by divine Revelation; e&s;|pecially by the example of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. At Mount Sinai, it was appointed by a po&s;itive, moral and perpetual commandment of God. And in <HI>Heb.</HI> x. 25, it is recommended, "for&s;ake not the a&s;&s;embling of your&s;elves to|gether." In &s;hort, it is a part of the law of God, &s;o deeply engraven on the natural table of the human heart, that while almo&s;t every other divine impre&s;&s;ion is era&s;ed, by the general defec|tion, this remaineth legible. Hence may be
<PB N="23" REF="024283_0021_0FC5E95CDD624720">
&s;een, in every part of the world, among all na|tions, certain places and times &s;et apart for pub|lic wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>It is evidently the mind and command of God.</P>
<P>THEREFORE to wor&s;hip him in the beauty of holine&s;s, mu&s;t be from re&s;pect to his authority; becau&s;e it is his plea&s;ure, that we a&s;&s;emble our|&s;elves together for this purpose: Making his command the rule of our conduct in this parti|cular. That &s;ervant cannot be called obedi|ent one, who does the very thing the ma&s;ter commands, unle&s;s he performs it in obedience to the command: He may do the thing com|manded, for other rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>MANY people, formerly among the Jews, and doubtle&s;s among us, attend the place of public wor&s;hip, not from re&s;pect to God, or his com|mand, but for other rea&s;ons; and neglect the wor&s;hip of God al&s;o for the &s;ame rea&s;ons. Not becau&s;e God has forbidden it, I hope&mdash;not pure|ly as an intended affront to Deity: It is becau&s;e they chu&s;e &s;o to do. But when it happens to be the good plea&s;ure of &s;uch people to repair to
<PB N="24" REF="024283_0022_0FC5E95F94F7DBE78">
the hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, can they, in any &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to wor&s;hip God in the beauty of holine&s;s? If they are inattentive to his command, they certainly &s;ee no comeline&s;s in him, that they &s;hould de&s;ire and prai&s;e him; and &s;o are de&s;ti|tute of the fir&s;t qualification, as it relates to a right view of the object; and of the &s;econd, becau&s;e not in obedience to his requi&s;ition.</P>
<P>IF, then, we are de&s;irous of wor&s;hipping God in the beauty of holine&s;s, let his &s;acred com|mand have its proper influence upon us. Let us &s;hew re&s;pect to, and honour his command, by waiting upon him in his hou&s;e: And &s;ee to it, that we are right in the fir&s;t particular.</P>
<P>HE that honoreth me, I will honor.</P>
<P>THIS is binding upon all charcters. The fir&s;t &s;tep in duty. And the man who neglects to pay this tribute of public homage to the Dei|ty, &s;tands convicted of mo&s;t de&s;picable di&s;inge|nuity. He proclaims him&s;elf de&s;titute of the fear of God&mdash;of a &s;uitable re&s;pect for &s;ocity, and is unawed by his own con&s;cience, or is blinded by the God of this world.</P>
<P>ORDER is beautiful. God is a God of order. The order of his hou&s;e and wor&s;hip is beauti|ful
<PB N="25" REF="024283_0023_0FC5E961D8FBB4C8">
Here is a proper place; but I &s;hall &s;ay nothing about coming in &s;ea&s;on, at the appoint|ed hour of wor&s;hip, or re&s;pecting decency of be|haviour while in the hou&s;e. There is certainly no beauty in levity&mdash;in gazing or drow&s;ine&s;s; pa&s;&s;ing over the&s;e, I would ob&s;erve, that a</P>
<P>SECOND qualification of acceptable wor&s;hip is, that our hearts be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty of the Being with whom we have to do.</P>
<P>IN the &s;everal parts of wor&s;hip, we as really mini&s;ter before God, as the Angels who abide in his pre&s;ence. We &s;hould behave, at lea&s;t, with as much reverence and fear, as if we were in hea|ven, in the immediate pre&s;ence of God, in the mid&s;t of all the ble&s;&s;ed Angels, tho&s;e ten thou|&s;and times ten thou&s;and who &s;tand before him.</P>
<P>HERE God meets us, as he did Mo&s;es of old, on the mercy-&s;eat&mdash;he communes with us&mdash;he &s;ees and knows our hearts, as perfectly as he &s;ees the Angels in heaven. Hence he requires us to wor&s;hip him in the &s;pirit, and with the under|&s;tanding. God and Angels are witne&s;&s;es of our temper and conduct; it is an affair in which life
<PB N="26" REF="024283_0024_0FC5E966AC34A680">
or death is pending. No wonder good old Ja|cob &s;hould &s;ay, "How dreadful is this place! It is the hou&s;e of God, the gate of heaven."&mdash;And holy Job, "Shall not his dread, or the dread of him, fall upon us?"</P>
<P>GOD told the prophet, when thou &s;peak|e&s;t to the people, "thou &s;halt be as my mouth." And the apo&s;tle &s;aid, "we be&s;eech you in God's &s;tead." And even the heathen king of Moab, was impre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, when the pro|phet told him he had a me&s;&s;age from the Lord, "he ro&s;e up out of his &s;eat," to &s;hew his rever|ence for the Deity. In great kindne&s;s, there|fore, has our Saviour Commanded, "Take heed how ye hear." Our very life dependeth upon it. "Hear, and your &s;oul &s;hall live."</P>
<P N="3">3. We mu&s;t di&s;engage our&s;elves from the world. It's cares must be laid a&s;ide. "Two ma&s;ters cannot be &s;erved at the &s;ame time."&mdash;"Put thy &s;hoes off thy feet," was God's com|mand to Mo&s;es, "for the place whereon thou &s;tande&s;t, is holy ground." Our hearts may not bring their coveteou&s;ne&s;s, nor worldly embar|ra&s;&s;ments with them, into the wor&s;hip of God:
<PB N="27" REF="024283_0025_0FC5E96AC0F3C258">
The&s;e will ob&s;truct the entrance of his word in|to the heart, "by which we mu&s;t be begotten to a lively hope."</P>
<P>WHEN Abraham was about to offer &s;acrifice, before he arrived at the appointed &s;pot, he made a pau&s;e; and &s;aid to his &s;ervants, "tarry ye here, while I go yonder and wor&s;hip." So, when we come to wor&s;hip, all worldly anxieties mu&s;t be left behind; the be&s;t temporal things are but &s;ervants to men, as men &s;hould be to God.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT mu&s;t be performed in the exerci&s;e of &s;aith.&mdash;"He that cometh to God, to wor&s;hip, mu&s;t believe that he <HI>is,</HI> and that he is the reward|er of them who diligently &s;eek him." And our reward will be in proportion to the degree of our faith. The Roman captain, when he &s;ent to Chri&s;t, entreating help for his &s;ick &s;ervant' believed him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with <HI>divine</HI> power and willingne&s;s, to hear and relieve the mi&s;erable; and he al&s;o felt his own unworthine&s;s to receive a vi&s;it from him. Penetrated with the divine conde&s;cen&s;ion and readine&s;s our Saviour exhibited in promi&s;ing, even before he is reque&s;ted,

<P>With &s;uch a faith, in the power, willingne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Lord, to hear and re|lieve our&s;elves, and tho&s;e for whom we pray, &s;hould public wor&s;hip be performed. This is honoring the Lord.</P>
<P>'DOES the fond parent, who is evil, readily give a mor&s;el of bread to the beloved child&mdash;and will not the Lord, who is good, more readi|ly give &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, even eternal life, to tho&s;e who a&s;k? Suppo&s;e it is the reward of &s;eeking, it is not of debt, but of grace.</P>
<P>'THIS is the faith in which the parts of wor|&s;hip &s;hould be performed. This is according to truth, and is beautiful. But, de&s;titute of this faith, our wor&s;hip will be deformed&mdash;the Lord viewed as an "hard and au&s;tere ma&s;ter, reaping where he has not &s;trewed." This is not beau|tiful. Faith, then, in the prevalency of Chri&s;t's

interce&s;&s;ion, in his all-&s;ufficiency, and readine&s;s to help, as being the day's man, between hea|ven and earth, is an important qualification of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is al&s;o implied, that we have a &s;upreme love to the object, and to the &s;ervice itself, for the &s;ake of the object.</P>
<P>THOSE who&s;e thoughts are wandering from thing to thing, to the utmo&s;t boundaries of cre|ation, while in the hou&s;e of God, cannot be &s;aid to wor&s;hip him. But love will properly fix the mind. Love readily and naturally ponders and mu&s;es upon its object. It will engage us in every part of worship, and render the whole plea&s;ant &amp; delightful. Love is deaf, and blind to all but its own object. God is the great object of worship; while addre&s;&s;ing him; other objects &s;hould be forgotten. It is the delight of &s;uch per&s;ons, to meditate in the law of the Lord.&mdash;Its di&s;coveries allure their feet to the wor&s;hip of God, and &s;weetly detain them in the &s;anctuary. The p&s;almi&s;t was, no doubt, in a &s;uitable tem|per for wor&s;hipping God; and it was the very language of love, when he &s;aid; "I was glad
<PB N="30" REF="024283_0028_0FC5E97508ACFA50">
when they &s;aid unto me, come, let us go unto the hou&s;e of the Lord." It was love that tu|ned the harp of that &s;weet &s;inger of Israel. It was love induced him to &s;ay, that a day &s;pent in the hou&s;e of his God, was better than thou|&s;ands el&s;ewhere. It was love made him prefer the office of a door-keeper, to a dwelling in the tents of wickedne&s;s. This is the frame of &s;pi|rit requi&s;ite to wor&s;hip God in the beauty of holine&s;s. David loved the object&mdash;&s;o mu&s;t we; &s;o mu&s;t every one el&s;e, to wor&s;hip as he did.&mdash;To &s;uch &s;ouls, all the parts of wor&s;hip, as means of intercour&s;e with God, yield a mo&s;t delightful entertainment. The Throne of Grace is the very porch of heaven. Here we are allowed, without the imputation of pre&s;umption, to plead with God, for the good of our &s;ouls, and the be&s;t of favours. Here we may wait, and here re|ceive his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>No doubt, the heavenly inhabitants wor&s;hip in the beauty of holine&s;s; but what is the prin|cipal qualification? What the temper which animates the wor&s;hip of tho&s;e happy &s;pirits a|bove? It is love.&mdash;It is a &s;ervent unabating
<PB N="31" REF="024283_0029_0FC5E97A2E433F18">
love to the adorable object. And as the object of our wor&s;hip is the &s;ame in this hou&s;e as in heaven, the &s;ame mu&s;t be our love, at lea&s;t in kind.</P>
<P N="6">6. The la&s;t qualification I &s;hall mention, is, harmony and union among our&s;elves. It mu&s;t be performed in the exerci&s;e of brotherly kindne&s;s. All angry, tumultuous, and revenge|ful pa&s;&s;ions, must be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, hu&s;hed into &s;i|lence. This is enjoined by our Saviour, as a nece&s;&s;ary duty. If we have aught again&s;t a brother, acceptable &s;acrifice cannot be perform|ed, until the means HE has pre&s;cribed of re|conciliation, be fir&s;t u&s;ed. And the Apo&s;tle ex|horts, "Be kindly affectioned one to another. Put on kindne&s;s and charity." This is wor&s;hip|ping the Lord in the unity of the &s;pirit, and in the bond of peace&mdash;In the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, by whom we are united to God, and one another. It is abundantly evident, that one important qualification in &s;ocial wor&s;hip, is benevolence and harmony among our&s;elves.</P>

THUS have I endeavored to &s;hew, what views we mu&s;t have of God&mdash;and what mu&s;t be the temper of our minds, in order to wor&s;hip the Lord in the beauty of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE method of di&s;cour&s;e, renders it needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing to prove the divine character altogether excellent and beautiful; or that it is exhibited with a peculiar beauty of holine&s;s "in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." This is, no doubt, the view the P&s;almi&s;t had, of both, which exci|ted that devout emotion of &s;oul, emphatically expre&s;&s;ed by the interjection O!</P>

<P>OF the many arguments, which might, with advantage, be urged on this occa&s;ion, couched in this one letter, O! I &s;hall mention but a few,
<PB N="33" REF="024283_0031_0FC5E97CCA2B2A28">
to per&s;uade us to wor&s;hip the Lord as above de|&s;cribed. And,</P>
<P N="1">I. It is rea&s;onable, corre&s;ponding to our nature. We were made for this bu&s;ine&s;s. It is a peculiar honor, indeed, God has conferred on mankind, in making them capable of perform|ing &s;uch wor&s;hip. It is rea&s;onable that we have a right view of the divine character, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the right of command; that we view our&s;elves as his &s;ervants. If our exi&s;tence, and all our comforts are derived from, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the only right and power to di&s;po&s;e of us, and has commanded us to wor&s;hip him, it is rea&s;onable we perform that wor&s;hip, as a public te&s;timony, that we are the Lord's, and his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Our Saviour has informed us, that upon our compliance with even all his requi&s;itions, we are to view our&s;elves as unprofitable &s;ervants. In a word, whenever, or wherever, people build &s;uch a public hou&s;e, they practically declare their obligations to wor&s;hip God.&mdash;It is a &s;enti|ment deeply interwoven with our very frame. The conduct of all nations and ages, in agreeing

to &s;et apart &s;ome place or hou&s;e for this pur|po&s;e, fully evinces it.</P>
<P>IT requires but little rea&s;on to &s;ee even the dim light of nature teacheth the propriety of wor&s;hipping God in the manner above de&s;cri|bed. If he is infinitely great, and good, and merciful, and ju&s;t, and all our help is in and from him, it is rea&s;onable, that we &s;ee and ac|knowledge it&mdash;That we apply to him for help. And tho&s;e who neglect to wor&s;hip God, e&s;peci|ally after they have built an hou&s;e for that very purpo&s;e, are guilty of &s;elf-contradiction; they condemn their own conduct, at lea&s;t one part of it. They u&s;e all the means&mdash;&s;u&s;tain all the la|bour and expen&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to obtain a good end, and neglect it. That man would act un|rea&s;onably, who &s;hould be at the expen&s;e of buying, fencing, plowing, planting, hoeing and tending his field, with a view to a crop, if he &s;hould totally neglect to gather in the full ripe corn, and &s;uffer it to rot on the ground, while him&s;elf and family mu&s;t peri&s;h for want of bread.</P>
<P>To what end have you been at the expen&s;e and labour of building this hou&s;e? Was it not

<P>MOREOVER this is the rea&s;onable &s;ervice God has required of us; this is the part a&s;&s;igned to man's performance on the &s;tage of life. The heavens, and the earth, the &s;ea, and all creatures, are called upon, and they do wor&s;hip God, but not in the beauty of holine&s;s; they are unable to &s;ee the harmony of the divine perfections in the method of redemption; much le&s;s can they learn to exerci&s;e and imitate them. But, as we
<PB N="36" REF="024283_0034_0FC5E988AA130EA0">
alone, of all God's creatures on earth, can do both, let us play the man; act our part, while all nature around us is acting her's.</P>
<P>AND, as the whole creation was made to groan in bondage, by our folly, has &s;he not a claim upon us? Does &s;he not demand our a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in prayer to God, and in prai&s;e for po&s;&s;ible relief? Let us then, as the head and repre&s;enta|tive of the natural world, be the medium, and this hou&s;e the place, where the feebler homage of the inferior creation, may be offered to the Lord. As Christ is the head of the moral, and medium through which our &s;incere wor&s;hip com|eth up before God; and as by our di&s;obedience to the command of God, the cur&s;e was inflic|ted on the earth, let us make the effort to extri|cate the creature from that vanity and bondage to which our folly has &s;ubjected it; and now do as much for her liberty, as we have done to rob her of that jewel, and &s;ubject it to bondage.</P>

To tho&s;e who attend public wor&s;hip with|out the&s;e views of God's goodne&s;s and mercy and holine&s;s&mdash;without a view of the nece&s;&s;ity and &s;ufficiency of the Redeemer's atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;without love&mdash;without a de|&s;ire to re&s;emble him, and be with him in hea|ven, how heavily does the hour of wor&s;hip hang upon &s;uch people? how &s;mall an ob&s;tacle will prevent their attendance! how &s;eldom do they come! how late when they do! how drow&s;y while here! Nothing but the addre&s;s, novelty or variety of the &s;peaker, can gain their attention. Divine truth, the beauty of holine&s;s, is in&s;ipid to them; Chri&s;t has no charms&mdash;the &s;eals and pledges of his love&mdash;the very blood of the co|venant, they count as nothing&mdash;they long to have the worship over&mdash;and the Sabbath gone. Honey it&s;elf is not &s;weet to their ta&s;te&mdash;light it|&s;elf

Such people lo&s;e not only the fir&s;t fruits of heaven, but all the co&s;t and pains they are at in building a hou&s;e, and maintaining the wor&s;hip of God, is lo&s;t to them|&s;elves, though not to the cau&s;e, for the earth &s;hall &s;upport the woman. And they will al&s;o lo&s;e heaven it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But however dull and in&s;ipid the wor&s;hip of God may be to a carnal mind, this is for want of a right view of the object, and a &s;uitable temper towards it: For nothing can be more plea&s;ant, nothing more animating to a &s;oul &s;en|&s;ible of its own importance and danger, than the view of tho&s;e thou&s;ands of mercies and ble&s;&s;ings God is keeping for all tho&s;e who come to him through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Is there any thing on earth&mdash;can all the pro|fits, plea&s;ures, and honors of this world, and all the gay &s;cenes of nature, &s;uppo&s;ing them all to fall to the &s;hare of one man, can they all put &s;uch joy and gladne&s;s into the &s;oul, as the light of God's reconciling countenance, &s;hining upon it through the medium of his word and ordi|nances in his hou&s;e? Here is the place where God and Chri&s;t are wont to make them&s;elves

It was when the di&s;|ciples were met together, the Lord opened their under&s;tandings, to &s;ee the glory and beauty of the divine perfection &s;hining in the plan of mer|cy: And GOD him&s;elf conde&s;cending to be|&s;eech &s;inners to accept of pardon and eternal life; this is rea&s;on enough, not only to remove all di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing fear, but to awaken, nay, to fill the &s;oul with a joy that is un&s;peakable and full of glory. To &s;uch a &s;oul, prayer, hearing the word read and explained, and prai&s;e, the wor&s;hip of God is above all things, the mo&s;t entertaining. The&s;e views of the excellency of the God of Jacob, would make David forget that he was the hero, the king of I&s;rael, and the three di&s;ciples, that they belonged to this world. In an exta&s;y of delight, the one crieth out, "How amiable are thy taber|nacles, O Lord of Ho&s;ts, my &s;oul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my fle&s;h cry out for the living God. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that dwell in thy hou&s;e, they will be &s;till prai&s;ing thee. A day in thy courts, is better than a thou&s;and el&s;ewhere.

It is the only method to pre|pare us to a&s;&s;ociate with &s;aints and angels in hea|ven&mdash;to fit us for tho&s;e exalted employments&mdash;that re&s;t which remaineth for the people of God. Nothing on earth &s;o nearly re&s;embles heaven, as an a&s;&s;embly wor&s;hipping God, united in the &s;pi|rit of meekne&s;s, faith and charity. No wonder the di&s;ciples &s;hould &s;ay, it is good for us to be here. Tho&s;e who &s;incerely love the gates of Zion, the wor&s;hip and the order, are candidates for heaven, making con&s;tant advances toward that happy region.
