<P>IT is merely in compliance with cu&s;tom I &s;it down to write a Preface. Dr. <HI>Gold&s;mith'</HI>s writings need not an eulogium at this hour: they may be compared to the invaluable paintings of <HI>Raphael;</HI> the longer they are in the world, their e&s;timation becomes more exten&s;ive. Time has drawn the veil of ob|livion over the works of many writers, once renowned (if we may credit tradition) for every perfection that captivates. Nature was certainly wanting to enrich tho&s;e com|po&s;itions. What &s;he has had a hand in, Time reverences, and a final di&s;&s;olution can only de&s;troy. How happy, then, mu&s;t the hallowed &s;pirit of <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> be, who&s;e Beau|ties wear the &s;imple brilliancy of Nature,

<P>The Pictures I have given from his Poems, are the highe&s;t fini&s;hed in the group; and the whole &s;election will be found, it is hoped, meriting the attention and patronage of the refined lovers of ele|gant and e&s;timable literature.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M. B.</HEAD>
<P>FAME, the only inflexible friend of Genius, has been &s;ingularly kind to the Author who&s;e life I with much plea&s;ure &s;it down to give &s;ome ac|count of. She has &s;ounded the prai&s;es of her favourite to the extremities of ta&s;te and literary refinement. The Court and the Cottage &s;hare with equal felicity the invaluable fruits of his elegant &s;tudies! The &s;malle&s;t memorial is a beacon for the incautious heart of virtue and &s;implicity, or a balm for the wounded &s;oul of the comfortle&s;s! Hence the lovers of human excellence have been &s;edulous in e&s;tabli&s;hing our writer's reputation on the ba&s;is of immortality.</P>
<P><HI>Gold&s;mith'</HI>s biographers have been many; their opinions, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, different; but they all agree that he was a man of elevated genius, unbounded philanthropy, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the milk
<PB N="vi" REF="032200_0004_0FF183542F7CB148">
of human kindne&s;s in a &s;upereminent degree. I have their &s;everal accounts before me; and, upon an impartial &s;urvey, Dr. <HI>Glover'</HI>s &s;tands highe&s;t in my e&s;timation. He was <HI>Gold&s;mith'</HI>s intimate friend, a companion in many of his literary pur&s;uits, and his enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer! What &s;uch a writer &s;ays, as far as relates to facts, mu&s;t be li&s;tened to with more plea&s;ure than a mere work of fiction, however elaborate, or &s;plendidly &s;et off. It gives me plea&s;ure to acknowledge the obligations I lie under to this ingenious and excellent companion, for many particulars relative to Dr. <HI>Gold&s;mith.</HI> I &s;hall give his account entire, marked with double commas,</P>
<P>"<HI>OLIVER GOLDSMITH</HI> was born at <HI>Ro&s;common,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the year 1731. His father, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;mall e&s;tate in that coun|ty, had nine &s;ons, of which <HI>Oliver</HI> was the third. He was originally intended for the church; and with that view, after being well in&s;tructed in the cla&s;&s;ics, was, with his brother the Rev. <HI>Henry Gold&s;mith,</HI> placed in <HI>Trinity</HI> col|lege, <HI>Dublin,</HI> about the latter end of the year 1749. In this &s;eminary of learning he continu|ed a few years, when he took a Bachelor's degree; but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college, <HI>Oliver,</HI> by the advice of Dean <HI>Gold&s;mith,</HI> of <HI>Cork,</HI> turned his thoughts to the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic, and,
<PB N="vii" REF="032200_0004_0FF183542F7CB148">
after attending &s;ome cour&s;es of anatomy in <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> proceeded to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the year 1751, where he &s;tudied the &s;everal branches of medi|cine under the different Profe&s;&s;ors in that univer|&s;ity, which was de&s;ervedly ranked among the fir&s;t &s;chools of phy&s;ic in <HI>Europe.</HI> His benefi|cent di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon involved him in unexpected difficulties, and he was obliged precipitately to leave <HI>Scotland,</HI> in con&s;equence of engaging him|&s;elf to pay a con&s;iderable &s;um of money for a fellow-&s;tudent.</P>
<P>"A few days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at <HI>Sunderland,</HI> near <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> where he was arre&s;ted at the &s;uit of one <HI>Barclay,</HI> a taylor in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to whom he had given &s;ecurity for his friend. By the good graces of <HI>Laughlin Maclane,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> and Dr. <HI>Sleigh,</HI> who were then in the college, he was &s;oon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his pa&s;&s;age on board a <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hip to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> whence, after a &s;hort &s;tay, he proceed|ed to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> He then vi&s;ited great part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome time at <HI>Stra&s;|bourg</HI> and <HI>Lovain,</HI> where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in Phy&s;ic, he accompanied an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> gentleman to <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P>"It is undoubtedly fact, that this ingenious, unfortunate man, made mo&s;t part of his tour on foot! He had left <HI>England</HI> with very little mo|ney; and, being of a philo&s;ophical turn, and at
<PB N="viii" REF="032200_0005_0FF18357089F0030">
that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a body capable of &s;u&s;taining every fatigue, and a heart not ea&s;ily terrified at danger, he became an enthu&s;ia&s;t to the de&s;ign he had formed of &s;eeing the manners of different countries. He had &s;ome knowledge of the <HI>French</HI> language, and of mu&s;ic; he played tole|rably well on the <HI>German</HI> flute; which, from an amu&s;ement, became at &s;ome times the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. His learning produced him an ho&s;|pitable reception at mo&s;t of the religious hou&s;es, and his mu&s;ic made him welcome to the pea&s;ants of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> 'Whenever I ap|proached a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e towards night-fall,' he u&s;ed to &s;ay, 'I played one of my mo&s;t mer|ry tunes, and that generally procured me not only a lodging, but &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the next day: but in truth,' (his con&s;tant expre&s;&s;ion) 'I mu&s;t own, whenever I attempted to entertain per&s;ons of a higher rank, they always thought my per|formance odious, and never made me any re|turn for my endeavours to plea&s;e them.'</P>
<P>"On his arrival at <HI>Geneva,</HI> he was recom|mended as a proper per&s;on for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a con&s;iderable &s;um of money by his uncle, Mr. <HI>S</HI>&mdash;. This youth, who was articled to an attorney, on receipt of his fortune, deter|mined to &s;ee the world; and, on his engaging with his preceptor, made a provi&s;o, that he &s;hould be permitted to govern him&s;elf; and our
<PB N="ix" REF="032200_0005_0FF18357089F0030">
traveller &s;oon found his pupil under&s;tood the art of directing in money concerns extremely well, as avarice was his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion</P>
<P>"During <HI>Gold&s;mith'</HI>s continuance in <HI>Switzer|land,</HI> he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given &s;ome &s;triking proofs at the college of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> It was from hence he &s;ent the fir&s;t &s;ketch of his delightful epi&s;tle, called <HI>The Traveller,</HI> to his bother, the clergy|man, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who, giving up fame and for|tune, had retired, with an amiable wife, to happine&s;s and ob&s;curity, on an income of only 401. a year.</P>
<P>"From <HI>Geneva,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> and his pupil vi&s;ited the South of <HI>France,</HI> where the young man, upon &s;ome di&s;agreement with his preceptor, paid him the &s;mall part of his &s;alary which was due, and embarked at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> for <HI>England.</HI> Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large, and pa&s;&s;ed through a number of difficulties in traver&s;ing the greate&s;t part of <HI>France.</HI> At length, his curio&s;ity being grati|fied, he bent his cour&s;e towards <HI>England,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Dover,</HI> the beginning of the winter, in the year 1758.</P>
<P>"His finances were &s;o low on his return to <HI>England,</HI> that he with difficulty got to the me|tropolis, his whole &s;tock of ca&s;h amounting to no more than a few halfpence! An entire &s;tran|ger in <HI>London,</HI> his mind was filled with the
<PB N="x" REF="032200_0006_0FF18358A1106AA0">
mo&s;t gloomy reflections, in con&s;equence of his embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation! He applied to &s;everal apothecaries, in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman; but his broad <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> accent, and the uncouthne&s;s of his appearance, occa&s;ioned him to meet with in&s;ult from mo&s;t of the medicinal tribe. The next day, how|ever, a chymi&s;t near <HI>Fi&s;h-&s;treet,</HI> &s;truck with his forlorn condition, and the &s;implicity of his man|ner, took him into his laboratory, where he continued till he di&s;covered his old friend Dr. <HI>Sleigh</HI> was in <HI>London.</HI> This gentleman received him with the warme&s;t affection, and liberally invited him to &s;hare his pur&s;e till &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;h|ment could be procured for him. <HI>Gold&s;mith,</HI> unwilling to be a burthen to his friend, a &s;hort time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the late Rev. Dr. <HI>Milner,</HI> in in&s;tructing the young gentlemen at the academy at <HI>Peckham;</HI> and acquitted him&s;elf greatly to the Doctor's &s;atisfaction for a &s;hort time; but, having obtained &s;ome reputation by the critici&s;ms he had written in the <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> Mr. <HI>Griffiths,</HI> the principal proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, re&s;olving to pur|&s;ue the profe&s;&s;ion of writing, he returned to <HI>London,</HI> as the mart where abilities of every kind were &s;ure of meeting di&s;tinction and re|ward. Here he determined to adopt a plan of the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy, and took lodgings in
<PB N="xi" REF="032200_0006_0FF18358A1106AA0">
<HI>Green-Arbour Court,</HI> in the <HI>Old-Bailey,</HI> where he wrote &s;everal ingenious pieces. The late Mr. <HI>Newbery,</HI> who at that time gave great encour|agement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author, and intro|duced him as one of the writers in the <HI>Public Ledger,</HI> in which his <HI>Citizen of the World</HI> ori|ginally appeared, under the title of '<HI>Chine&s;e Letters.</HI>'</P>
<P>"<HI>Fortune</HI> now &s;eemed to take &s;ome notice of a man &s;he had long neglected. The &s;implicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the merit of his productions, made his company very acceptable to a number of re&s;pectable per|&s;ons; and he emerged from his &s;habby apart|ments near the <HI>Old-Bailey</HI> to the politer air of the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he took hand&s;ome chambers, and lived in a genteel &s;tyle. The publication of his <HI>Traveller,</HI> his <HI>Vicar of Wakefield,</HI> and his <HI>Letters on the Hi&s;tory of England,</HI> was fol|lowed by the performance of his comedy of <HI>The Good-natured Man,</HI> at <HI>Covent-garden</HI> theatre, and placed him in the fir&s;t rank of the poets of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>"Our Doctor, as he was now univer&s;ally call|ed, had a con&s;tant levee of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed coun|trymen; who&s;e wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved; and he has been often known to leave him&s;elf even without a guinea, in order to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of others!</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="032200_0007_0FF1835A8F8E3550">
"Another feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his <HI>De&s;erted Village,</HI> the book&s;eller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy; which the Doctor mentioned, a few hours after, to one of his friends, who ob|&s;erved it was a very great &s;um for &s;o &s;hort a performance. 'In truth,' replied <HI>Gold&s;mith,</HI> 'I think &s;o too; it is much more than the hone&s;t man can afford, or the piece is worth; I have not been ea&s;y &s;ince I received it; therefore I will go back and return him his note;' which he ab&s;olutely did, and left it entirely to the book|&s;eller to pay him according to the profits pro|duced by the &s;ale of the poem, which turned out very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>"During the la&s;t rehear&s;al of his comedy, intitled, <HI>She Stoops to Conquer,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Col|man</HI> had no opinion would &s;ucceed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of <HI>Tony Lampkin'</HI>s &s;peeches, being apprehen&s;ive it might injure the play, the manager with great keenne&s;s replied, 'P&s;ha, my dear Doctor, do not be fear|ful of <HI>&s;quibs,</HI> when we have been &s;itting almo&s;t the&s;e two hours upon a <HI>barrel of gunpowder!</HI>' The piece, however, contrary to Mr. <HI>Colman'</HI>s expectation, was received with uncommon ap|plau&s;e by the audience; and <HI>Gold&s;mith'</HI>s pride was &s;o hurt by the &s;everity of the above ob&s;er|vation,
<PB N="xiii" REF="032200_0007_0FF1835A8F8E3550">
that it entirely put an end to his friend|&s;hip for the gentleman who made it.</P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding the great &s;ucce&s;s of his pieces, by &s;ome of which, it is a&s;&s;erted, upon good authority, he cleared 1800l. in one year, his circum&s;tances were by no means in a pro&s;|perous &s;ituation! partly owing to the liberality of his di&s;po&s;ition, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had contracted of gaming, the arts of which he knew very little of, and con&s;equently became the prey of tho&s;e who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t before his death, he had formed a de|&s;ign for executing an <HI>Univer&s;al Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,</HI> the pro&s;pectus of which he actually printed, and di&s;tributed among his ac|quaintance. In this work, &s;everal of his literary friends (particularly Sir <HI>Jo&s;hua Reynolds,</HI> Dr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Beauclerc,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>) had engaged to furni&s;h him with articles upon differ|ent &s;ubjects. He had entertained the mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations from the &s;ucce&s;s of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the book&s;ellers which he had imagined it would undoubtedly receive; and he u&s;ed to lament this circum&s;tance almo&s;t to the la&s;t hour of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>"He had been for &s;ome years afflicted, at different times, with a violent &s;trangury, which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part
<PB N="xiv" REF="032200_0008_0FF1835DE60E1C78">
of his life; and which, united with the vexa|tions he &s;uffered upon other occa&s;ions, brought on a kind of habitual de&s;pondency. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being improperly treated, termi|nated in his di&s;&s;olution on the 4th day of <HI>April,</HI> 1774, in the forty-third year of his age. His friends, who were very numerous and re&s;pecta|ble, had determined to bury him in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> where a tablet was to have been erected to his memory. His pall was to have been &s;up|ported by Lord <HI>Shelburne,</HI> Lord <HI>Louth,</HI> Sir <HI>Jo&s;hua Reynolds,</HI> the Hon. Mr. <HI>Beauclerc,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garrick;</HI> but, from &s;ome unaccountable circum&s;tances, this de&s;ign was dropped, and his remains were privately depo&s;it|ed in the <HI>Temple</HI> burial-ground.</P>
<P>"As to his character, it is &s;trongly illu&s;trated by Mr. <HI>Pope'</HI>s line;
<Q><L>'In wit a man, &s;implicity a child.'</L></Q></P>
<P>"The learned lei&s;ure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by di&s;tre&s;&s;es which aro&s;e from the openne&s;s of his temper, and which &s;ometimes threw him into loud fits of pa&s;&s;ion; but this impetuo&s;ity was corrected upon a mo|ment's reflection; and his &s;ervants have been known, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, purpo&s;ely to throw them&s;elves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good
<PB N="xv" REF="032200_0008_0FF1835DE60E1C78">
fortune to be reproved, was certain of being re|warded for it. His di&s;appointments at other times made him peevi&s;h and &s;ullen, and he has often left a party of convivial friends abruptly in the evening, in order to go home and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ood over his misfortunes: a circum&s;tance which con|tributed not a little to the increa&s;e of his malady.</P>
<P>"The univer&s;al e&s;teem in which his poems are held, and the repeated plea&s;ure they give in the peru&s;al, is a &s;triking te&s;t of their merit. He was a &s;tudious and correct ob&s;erver of nature, hap|py in the &s;election of his images, in the choice of his &s;ubjects, and in the harmony of his ver&s;ifica|tion; and, though his embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation pre|vented him from putting the la&s;t hand to many of his productions, his <HI>Hermit,</HI> his <HI>Traveller,</HI> and his <HI>De&s;erted Village,</HI> bid fair to claim a place among the mo&s;t fini&s;hed pieces in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language.</P>
<P>"The writer of the&s;e anecdotes cannot con|clude without declaring, that, as different ac|counts have been given of this ingenious man, the&s;e are all founded upon facts, and collected by one who lived with him upon the mo&s;t friendly footing for a great number of years, and who nev|er felt any &s;orrow more &s;en&s;ibly than that which was occa&s;ioned by his death."</P>
<P>Let it be turned to what theme it will, the opinion of an elevated literary character will &s;ucceed be&s;t with the million. Let us hear what
<PB N="xvi" REF="032200_0009_0FF183621F3E98A0">
Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> &s;ays of our author, in his Life of <HI>Parnell.</HI></P>
<P>"THE Life of Dr. <HI>Parnell</HI> is a ta&s;k which I &s;hould very willingly decline, &s;ince it has been lately written by <HI>Gold&s;mith,</HI> a man of &s;uch variety of powers, and &s;uch felicity of performance, that he always &s;eemed to do be&s;t that which he was doing; a man who had the art of being minute without tediou&s;ne&s;s, and general without confu|&s;ion; who&s;e language was copious without exu|bernace, exact without con&s;traint, and ea&s;y with|out weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>"What &s;uch an author has told, who would tell again? I have made an ab&s;tract from his larger nar|rative; and &s;hall have this gratification from my attempt, that it gives me an opportunity of paying due tribute to the memory of a departed genius."</P>
<P>The mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of the account which Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> has given of our author, in his Life of <HI>Garrick,</HI> de&s;erves the reader's attention. The latter part of it exhibits to mankind, feelings of the fir&s;t quality in nature.</P>
<P>"EVERY thing of <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> &s;eems to bear the magical touch of an enchanter; no man took le&s;s pains, and yet produced &s;o powerful an effect; the great beauty of his compo&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts in a clear, copious, and expre&s;&s;ive &s;tyle.</P>
<P>"<HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> was &s;o &s;incere a man, that he could not conceal what was uppermo&s;t in his mind: &s;o far from de&s;iring to appear in the eye of the
<PB N="xvii" REF="032200_0009_0FF183621F3E98A0">
world to the be&s;t advantage, he took more pains to be e&s;teemed wor&s;e than he was, than others do to appear better than they are.</P>
<P>"His di&s;po&s;ition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mind was tender and com|pa&s;&s;ionate; no unhappy per&s;on ever &s;ued to him for relief, without obtaining it, if he had any thing to give; and, rather than not relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he would borrow. The poor woman, with whom he had lodged, during his ob&s;curi|ty, &s;everal years in <HI>Green-Arbour Court,</HI> by his death lo&s;t an excellent friend; for the Doctor often &s;upplied her with food from his table, and vi&s;ited her frequently with the &s;ole purpo&s;e to be kind to her. He had his di&s;like, as mo&s;t men have, to particular people, but unmixed with rancour. He, lea&s;t of all mankind, ap|proved <HI>Baretti'</HI>s conver&s;ation; he con&s;idered him as an in&s;olent, over-bearing foreigner; as <HI>Baretti,</HI> in his turn, thought him an unpoli&s;hed man, and an ab&s;urd companion: but, when this unhappy <HI>Italian</HI> was charged with murder, and afterwards &s;ent by Sir <HI>John Fielding</HI> to <HI>New|gate, Gold&s;mith</HI> opened his pur&s;e, and would have given him every &s;hilling it contained; he, at the &s;ame time, in&s;i&s;ted upon going in the coach with him to the place of his confinement."</P>
<P>A hand&s;ome Monument was erected to his Memory, &s;ome time &s;ince, in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> in the Poets' Corner, between <HI>Gay'</HI>s and the Duke of <HI>Argyle'</HI>s.</P>

<HEAD>STORY OF MISS SYLVIA S&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>MISS SYLVIA S&mdash;was de&s;cended from one of the be&s;t families in the kingdom, and was left a large fortune upon her &s;i&s;ter's decea&s;e. She had early in life been in|troduced into company, and contracted a pa&s;&s;ion for elegance and expence. It is u&s;ual to make the heroine of a &s;tory very witty, and very beau|tiful; and &s;uch circum&s;tances are &s;o &s;urely expected, that they are &s;carce attended to. But whatever the fine&s;t poet could conceive of wit, or the mo&s;t celebrated painter imagine of beauty, were excelled in the perfections of this young lady. Her &s;uperiority in both was allowed by all, who either heard, or had &s;een her. She was naturally gay, generous to a fault, good-na|tured to the highe&s;t degree, affable in conver&s;ation;
<PB N="2" REF="032200_0014_0FF1836FADE413D0">
and &s;ome of her letters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> other writings, as well in ver&s;e as pro&s;e, would have &s;hone among&s;t tho&s;e of the mo&s;t celebrated wits of this, or any other age, had they been publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>But the&s;e great qualifications were marked by another, which le&s;&s;ened the value of them all. She was imprudent! But let it not be imagined, that her reputation or honor &s;uffered by her im|prudence; I only mean, &s;he had no knowledge of the u&s;e of money; &s;he relieved di&s;tre&s;s, by putting her&s;elf into the circum&s;tances of the ob|ject who&s;e wants &s;he &s;upplied.</P>
<P>She was arrived at the age of nineteen, when the croud of her lovers, and the continual repeti|tion of new flattery, had taught her to think &s;he could never be for&s;aken, and never poor. Young ladies are apt to expect a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, from a number of lovers; and yet I have &s;eldom &s;een a girl courted by an hundred lovers, that found an hu&s;band in any. Before the choice is fixed, &s;he has either lo&s;t her reputation, or her good &s;en&s;e; and the lo&s;s of either is &s;ufficient to con&s;ign her to perpetual virginity.</P>
<P>Among the number of this young lady's lovers, was the celebrated <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, who, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time, went by the name of <HI>the good-natured man.</HI> This gen|tleman, with talents that might have done honor to humanity, &s;uffered him&s;elf to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll at length into the lowe&s;t &s;tate of deba&s;ement. He followed the dictates of every newe&s;t pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ion; his love, his
<PB N="3" REF="032200_0014_0FF1836FADE413D0">
pity, his genero&s;ity, and even his friend&s;hips, were all in exce&s;s: he was unable to make head again&s;t any of his &s;en&s;ations or de&s;ires; but they were in general worthy wi&s;hes and de&s;ires; for he was con&s;titutionally virtuous. This gentleman, who at la&s;t died in a gaol, was, at that time, this lady's envied favourite.</P>
<P>It is probable that he, thoughtle&s;s creature! had no other pro&s;pect from this amour, but that of pa&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent moments agreeably. He only courted di&s;&s;ipation; but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happine&s;s. At length, however, his debts amounting to a con&s;iderable &s;um, he was arre&s;ted, and thrown into pri&s;on. He en|deavoured at fir&s;t to conceal his &s;ituation from his beautiful mi&s;tre&s;s; but &s;he &s;oon came to a knowledge of his di&s;tre&s;s, and took a fatal re&s;o|lution of freeing him from confinement by di&s;|charging all the demands of his creditors.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Then Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies at Bath.</HI></NOTE> was at that time in <HI>London,</HI> and re|pre&s;ented to the thoughtle&s;s young lady, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure would effectually ruin both; that &s;o warm a concern for the intere&s;ts of Mr <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, would, in the fir&s;t place, quite impair her fortune in the eyes of our &s;ex, and, what was wor&s;e, le&s;&s;en her reputation in tho&s;e of her own. He added, that thus bringing Mr. <HI>S</HI>&mdash;from pri&s;on, would be only a temporary relief; that a mind &s;o
<PB N="4" REF="032200_0015_0FF18373D3D01CF0">
generous as his, would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude; and, in&s;tead of improving in friend&s;hip or affection, he would only &s;tudy to avoid a creditor he could never repay: that, though &s;mall favours produce good-will, great ones de&s;troy friend&s;hip. The&s;e admonitions, however, were di&s;regarded; and &s;he too late found the prudence and truth of her advi&s;er. In &s;hort, her fortune was by this means exhau&s;ted; and, with all her attractians, &s;he found her ac|quaintance began to di&s;e&s;teem her, in proportion as &s;he became poor.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation &s;he accepted Mr. <HI>Na&s;h'</HI>s invi|tation of returning to <HI>Bath.</HI> He promi&s;ed to introduce her to the be&s;t company there; and he was a&s;&s;ured that her merit would do the re&s;t. Upon her very fir&s;t appearance, ladies of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction courted her friend&s;hip and e&s;teem; but a &s;ettled melancholy had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, and no amu&s;ements that they could propo&s;e were &s;ufficient to divert it. Yet &s;till, as if from habit, &s;he followed the crowd in its levities, and frequented tho&s;e places where all per&s;ons endea|vour to forget them&s;elves in the bu&s;tle of cere|mony and &s;how.</P>
<P>Her beauty, her &s;implicity, and her unguarded &s;ituation, &s;oon drew the attention of a de&s;igning wretch, who at that time kept one of the Rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> and who thought that this lady's merit, properly managed, might turn to good account.
<PB N="5" REF="032200_0015_0FF18373D3D01CF0">
This woman's name was Dame <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> a creature, who, though vicious, was in appearance &s;anctified; and, though de&s;igning, had &s;ome wit and humour. She began, by the humble&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, to ingratiate her&s;elf with Mi&s;s <HI>S</HI>&mdash;; &s;hewed that &s;he could be amu&s;ing as a companion, and, by frequent offers of money, proved that &s;he could be u&s;eful as a friend. Thus, by degrees, &s;he gained an entire a&s;cendant over this poor, thoughtle&s;s, de&s;erted girl; and, in le&s;s than one year, namely, about 1727, Mi&s;s <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, without ever tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws of virtue, had entirely lo&s;t her reputation. Whenever a per&s;on was wanting to make up a party for play at Dame <HI>Lind&s;ey's, Sylvia,</HI> as &s;he was then familiarly called, was &s;ent for, and was obliged to &s;uffer all tho&s;e &s;lights, which the rich but too often let fall upon their in feriors in point of fortune.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t, even the greate&s;t minds, the heart at la&s;t becomes level with the meanne&s;s of its con|dition; but in this charming girl it &s;truggled hard with adver&s;ity, and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with &s;ullen reluctance.</P>
<P>But though in the cour&s;e of three years &s;he was in the very eye of public in&s;pection, yet Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the architect, avers, that he could never, by the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervations, perceive her to be tainted with any other vice, than that of &s;uffering her&s;elf to be decoyed to the gaming-table, and, at her own hazard, playing for the amu&s;ement and ad|vantage
<PB N="6" REF="032200_0016_0FF18376A82E7408">
of others. Her friend, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> there|fore, thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with Dame <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> and to rent part of Mr. <HI>Wood's</HI> hou&s;e, in <HI>Queen-&s;quare,</HI> where &s;he behaved with the utmo&s;t complai&s;ance, regularity, and virtue.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, her dete&s;tation of life &s;till continued; &s;he found, that time would infallibly deprive her of part of her attractions, and that continual &s;olicitude would impair the re&s;t. With the&s;e reflections &s;he would frequently entertain her&s;elf, and an old faithful maid, in the vales of <HI>Bath,</HI> whenever the weather would permit them to walk out. She would even &s;ometimes &s;tart que&s;tions in company, with &s;eeming unconcern, in order to know what act of &s;uicide was ea&s;ie&s;t, and which was attended with the &s;malle&s;t pain. When tired with exerci&s;e, &s;he generally retired to meditation; and &s;he became habituated to early hours of &s;leep and re&s;t. But when the weather prevented her u&s;ual exerci&s;e, and her &s;leep was thus more difficult, &s;he made it a rule to ri&s;e from her bed, and walk about her chamber, till &s;he began to find an inclination for repo&s;e.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom made it nece&s;&s;ary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room: and the maid u&s;ually, when &s;he withdrew, locked the chamber door; and, pu&s;hing the key under it beyond reach; her mi&s;tre&s;s, by that con&s;tant me|thod, lay undi&s;turbed until &s;even o'clock in the
<PB N="7" REF="032200_0016_0FF18376A82E7408">
morning; then &s;he aro&s;e, unlocked the door, and rang the bell, as a &s;ignal for the maid to return.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of &s;eeming piety, regularity, and prudence continued for &s;ome time, till the gay, celebrated, toa&s;ted Mi&s;s <HI>Sylvia</HI> was &s;unk into an hou&s;ekeeper to the gentleman at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he lived. She was unable to keep company, for want of the elegancies of dre&s;s, that are the u&s;ual pa&s;&s;|port among the polite; and &s;he was too haughty to &s;eem to want them. The fa&s;hionable, the amu&s;ing, and the polite, in &s;ociety, now &s;eldom vi&s;ited her; and, from being once the object of every eye, &s;he was now de&s;erted by all, and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own impru|dence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> and part of of his family, were gone to <HI>London.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Sylvia</HI> was left with the re&s;t, as a governe&s;s, at <HI>Bath.</HI> She &s;ometimes &s;aw Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> and acknowledged the friend&s;hip of his admonitions, though &s;he refu&s;ed to accept any other marks of his genero&s;ity than that of advice. Upon the clo&s;e of the day in which Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> was expected to return from <HI>London,</HI> &s;he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at the di&s;appointment of not &s;eeing him; took particular care to &s;ettle the affairs of his family; and then, as u&s;ual, &s;at down to meditation. She now ca&s;t a retro&s;pect over her pa&s;t mi&s;conduct, and her approaching mi&s;ery; &s;he &s;aw, that even affluence gave her no real happi|ne&s;s, and from indigence &s;he thought nothing could
<PB N="8" REF="032200_0017_0FF18378410A9230">
be hoped but lingering calamity. She at length conceived the fatal re&s;olution of leaving a life, in which &s;he could &s;ee no corner for comfort, and terminating a &s;cene of imprudence in &s;uicide.</P>
<P>Thus re&s;olved, &s;he &s;at down at her dining|room window, and with cool intrepidity wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window:
<Q><L>O Death! thou plea&s;ing end of human woe!</L>
<L>Thou cure for life! Thou greate&s;t good below!</L>
<L>Still may'&s;t thou fly the coward, and the &s;lave,</L>
<L>And thy &s;oft &s;lumbers only ble&s;s the brave.</L></Q></P>
<P>She then went into company with the mo&s;t cheerful &s;erenity; talked of indifferet &s;ubjects till &s;upper, which &s;he ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family. There &s;he &s;pent the remaining hours, preceding bed-time, in dandling two of Mr. <HI>Wood's</HI> children on her knees. In retiring from thence to her chamber, &s;he went into the nur&s;ery, to take her leave of another child, as it lay &s;leeping in the cradle. Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her meditated guilt, &s;he could not avoid bur&s;ting into tears, and hug|ging it in her arms; &s;he then bid her old &s;er|vant a good night, for the fir&s;t time &s;he had ever done &s;o, and went to bed as u&s;ual.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032200_0017_0FF18378410A9230">
It is probable &s;he &s;oon quitted her bed, and was &s;eized with an alternation of pa&s;&s;ions, be|fore &s;he yielded to the impul&s;e of de&s;pair. She dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in clean linen, and white garments of every kind, like a bride-maid. Her gown was pinned over her brea&s;t, ju&s;t as a nur&s;e pins the &s;waddling cloaths of an infant. A pink &s;ilk girdle was the in&s;trument with which &s;he re&s;olv|ed to terminate her mi&s;ery, and this was length|ened by another made of gold thread. The end of the former was tied with a noo&s;e, and the latter with three knots, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from one another.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, &s;he &s;at down again, and read; for &s;he left the book open at that place, in the &s;tory of <HI>Olympia,</HI> in the <HI>Orlando Furio&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of <HI>Ari|o&s;to,</HI> where, by the perfidy and ingratitude of her bo&s;om friend, &s;he was ruined, and left to the mercy of an unpitying world. This tragical event gave her fre&s;h &s;pirits to go through her fatal purpo&s;e; &s;o &s;tanding upon a &s;tool, and fling|ing the girdle, which was tied round her neck, over a clo&s;et-door that opened into her chamber, &s;he remained &s;u&s;pended. Her weight however broke the girdle, and the poor de&s;pairer fell upon the floor with &s;uch violence, that her fall awak|ened a workman that lay in the hou&s;e, about half an hour after two o'clock.</P>
<P>Recovering her&s;elf, &s;he began to walk about the room, as her u&s;ual cu&s;tom was when &s;he
<PB N="10" REF="032200_0018_0FF1837C5CE527E0">
wanted &s;leep; and the workman imagining it to be only &s;ome ordinary accident, again went to &s;leep. She once more, therefore, had recour&s;e to a &s;tronger girdle made of &s;ilver thread; and this kept her &s;u&s;pended till &s;he died.</P>
<P>Her old maid continued in the morning to wait as u&s;ual for the ringing of the bell, and pro|tracted her patience hour after hour, till two o'clock in the afternoon; when the workmen at length entering the room through the window, found their unfortunate mi&s;tre&s;s &s;till hanging, and quite cold. The coroner's j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry being im|panelled, brought in their verdict, Lunacy; and her corp&s;e was next night decently buried in her father's grave, at the charge of a female compani|on, with whom &s;he had for many years an in&s;epar|able intimacy.</P>
<P>Thus ended a female wit, a toa&s;t, and a game|&s;ter; loved, admired, and for&s;aken; formed for the delight of &s;ociety, fallen by imprudence into an object of pity. Hundreds in high life lamented her fate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d wi&s;hed, when too late, to redre&s;s her injuries. They who once had helped to im|pair her fortune, now regretted that they a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;o mean a pur&s;uit. The little effects &s;he had left behind were bought up with the greate&s;t avidity, by tho&s;e who de&s;ired to pre&s;erve &s;ome token of a companion that once had given them &s;uch delight. The remembrance of every virtue &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of was now improv|ed

by pity. Her former follies were few, but the la&s;t &s;welled them to a large amount. As &s;he remains the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance to po&s;terity, that want of prudence alone, almo&s;t cancels e|very other virtue.</P>

<P><HI>Catharina</HI> was fifteen when her mother died: &s;he now, therefore, left her cottage, and went to live with the <HI>Lutheran</HI> mini&s;ter, by whom &s;he had been in&s;tructed from her childhood. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his hou&s;e &s;he re&s;ided, in quality of governe&s;s to his children; at once reconciling in her cha|racter unerring prudence with &s;urpri&s;ing vivacity.</P>

<P>This was an happy interview for <HI>Catharina.</HI> The little &s;tock of money &s;he had brought from home was by this time quite exhau&s;ted; her cloaths were gone, piece by piece, in order to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who had entertained her in their hou&s;es: her gene|rous countryman, therefore, parted with what he could &s;pare, to buy her clothes, furni&s;hed her with an hor&s;e, and gave her letters of recommendation to Mr. <HI>Gluck,</HI> a faithful friend of his father's, and &s;uperintendant of <HI>Marienburgh.</HI></P>

Our beautiful &s;tranger had only to appear, to be well received: &s;he was immediately admitted into the &s;uperintendant's family, as governe&s;s to his two daughters; and though yet but &s;eventeen, &s;hewed her&s;elf capable of in&s;tructing her &s;ex, not only in virtue, but politene&s;s.

<P>In order, therefore, to prevent further &s;olici|tations from others, as &s;oon as the officer came to town upon duty, &s;he offered him her per&s;on, which he accepted with tran&s;port; and their nup|tials were &s;olemnized as u&s;ual.

<P>In the mean time, the &s;iege went on with fury, aggravated on one &s;ide by ob&s;tinacy, on the other by revenge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous; the in|nocent pea&s;ant and the harmle&s;s virgin often &s;hared

<P>She had been hitherto poor, but &s;till was free; &s;he was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what it was to be a &s;lave: in this &s;ituation, however, &s;he behaved with piety and humility; and, though misfortunes had abated her vivacity, yet &s;he was chearful.

<HEAD>THE MAN OF THE WORLD. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IF you are fond of hearing <HI>hair-breadth' &s;apes,</HI> my hi&s;tory mu&s;t certainly plea&s;e; for I have been for twenty years upon the very verge of &s;tarving, without ever being &s;tarved.</P>
<P>My father, the younger &s;on of a good family, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall living in the church. His education was above his fortune, and his gene|ro&s;ity greater than his education. Poor as he was, he had his flatterers &s;till poorer than him&s;elf; for every dinner he gave them, they returned him an equivalent in prai&s;e; and this was all he wanted. The &s;ame ambition that actuates a mo|narch at the head of an army, influenced my fa|ther at the head of his table: he told the &s;tory of the ivy-tree, and that was laughed at; he re|peated the je&s;t of the two &s;cholars and one pair of breeches, and the company laughed at that; but the &s;tory of Taffy in the &s;edan chair were &s;ure to &s;et the table in a roar. Thus his plea&s;ure increa&s;ed, in proportion to the plea&s;ure he gave; he loved all the world, and he fancied all the world loved him.</P>
<P>As his fortune was but &s;mall, he lived up to the very extent of it; he had no intentions of
<PB N="66" REF="032200_0046_0FF183CD0946FC18">
leaving his children money, for that was dro&s;s he was re&s;olved they &s;hould have learning, for learning, he u&s;ed to ob&s;erve, was better than &s;ilver or gold. For this purpo&s;e he undertook to in&s;truct us him&s;elf; and took as much pains to form our morals, as to improve our under&s;tand|ing. We were told that univer&s;al benevolence was what fir&s;t cemented &s;ociety: we were taught to con&s;ider all the wants of mankind as our own; to regard the <HI>human face divine</HI> with affection and e&s;teem: he wound us up to be mere machines of pity, and rendered us incapable of with&s;tanding the lighte&s;t impul&s;e made either by real or ficti|tious di&s;tre&s;s; in a word, we were perfectly in|&s;tructed in the art of <HI>giving away</HI> thou&s;ands, be|fore we were taught the more nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tions of <HI>getting</HI> a farthing.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid imagining, that, thus refined by his le&s;&s;ons out of all my &s;u&s;picion, and di|ve&s;ted of even all the little cunning which na|ture had given me, I re&s;embled, upon my fir&s;t entrance into the bu&s;y and in&s;idious world, one of tho&s;e gladiators who were expo&s;ed without armour in the amphitheatre at Rome. My fa|ther, however, who had only &s;een the world on one &s;ide, &s;eemed to triumph in my &s;uperior di&s;|cernment; though my whole &s;tock of wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ted in being able to talk like him&s;elf upon &s;ubjects that once were u&s;eful, becau&s;e they were then topics of the bu&s;y world, but that now were

utterly u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e connected with the bu&s;y world no longer.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t opportunity he had of finding his ex|pectations di&s;appointed, was at the very middling figure I made in the Univer&s;ity: he had flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee me ri&s;ing into the foremo&s;t rank in literary reputation, but was mor|tified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown. His di&s;appointment might have been partly a&s;|cribed to his having over-rated my talents, and partly to my di&s;like of mathematical rea&s;onings at a time when my imagination and memory, yet un&s;atisfied, were more eager after new objects, than de&s;irous of rea&s;oning upon tho&s;e I knew This did not, however, plea&s;e my tutors, who ob&s;erved, indeed, that I was a little dull; but at the &s;ame time allowed, that I &s;eemed to be <HI>very good-natured,</HI> and had no harm in me.</P>
<P>After I had re&s;ided at college &s;even years, my father died, and left me&mdash;his ble&s;&s;ing. Thus &s;hoved from &s;hore without ill-nature to protect, or cunning to guide, or proper &s;tores to &s;ub&s;i&s;t me in &s;o dangerous a voyage, I was obliged to embark in the wide world at twenty-two. But, in order to &s;ettle in life, my friends <HI>advi&s;ed</HI> (for they always advi&s;e when they begin to de&s;pi&s;e us) they advi&s;ed me, I &s;ay, to go into orders.</P>
<P>To be obliged to wear a long wig, when I liked a &s;hort one, or a black coat, when I generally dre&s;&s;ed in brown, I thought was &s;uch a re&s;traint
<PB N="68" REF="032200_0047_0FF183CFE2284B10">
upon my liberty, that I ab&s;olutely rejected the propo&s;al. A prie&s;t in England is not the &s;ame mortified creature with a bonze in China; with us, not he that fa&s;ts be&s;t, but eats be&s;t, is reckon|ed the be&s;t liver: yet I rejected a life of luxury, indolence, and ea&s;e, from no other con&s;ideration but that boyi&s;h one of dre&s;s; &s;o that my friends were now perfectly &s;atisfied I was undone; and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the lea&s;t harm in him, and was &s;o very good-natured.</P>
<P>Poverty naturally begets dependance, and I was admitted as flatterer to a great man. At fir&s;t I was &s;urpri&s;ed, that the &s;ituation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought di&s;agree|able: there was no great trouble in li&s;tening at|tentively when his lord&s;hip &s;poke, and laughing when he looked round for applau&s;e. This even good-manners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too &s;oon, that his lord&s;hip was a greater dunce than my&s;elf; and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end. I now rather aimed at &s;etting him right, than at receiving his ab&s;urdities with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. To flat|ter tho&s;e we do not know, is an ea&s;y ta&s;k; but to flatter our intimate acquaintances, all who&s;e foi|bles are &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">gly in our eye, is drudgery in&s;up|portable. Every time I now opened my lips in prai&s;e, my fal&s;hood went to my con&s;cience: his lord&s;hip &s;oon perceived me to be unfit for &s;ervice; I was therefore di&s;charged; my patron at the &s;ame time being graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve,
<PB N="69" REF="032200_0047_0FF183CFE2284B10">
that he believed I was tolerably good-natured, and had not the lea&s;t harm in me.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in ambition, I had recour&s;e to love. A young lady, who lived with her aunt, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a pretty fortune in her own di&s;po&s;al, had given me, as I fancied, &s;ome rea&s;ons to expect &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;ymptoms by which I was guided were &s;triking: &s;he had always laugh|ed with me at her aukward acquaintance, and at her aunt among the number; &s;he always ob|&s;erved, that a man of &s;en&s;e would make a better hu&s;band than a fool, and I as con&s;tantly applied the ob&s;ervation in my own favour. She conti|nually talked in my company of friend&s;hip, and the beauties of the mind, and &s;poke of Mr. Shrimp my rival's high-heel'd &s;hoes with dete&s;ta|tion. The&s;e were circum&s;tances which I thought &s;trongly in my favour; &s;o, after re&s;olving, and re-re&s;olving I had courage enough to tell her my mind. Mi&s;s heard my propo&s;al with &s;erenity, &s;eeming at the &s;ame time to &s;tudy the figures of her fan. Out at la&s;t it came. There was but one &s;mall objection to complete our happine&s;s, which was no more than&mdash;that &s;he was married three months before to Mr. Shrimp with high-heel'd &s;hoes! By way of con&s;olation, however, &s;he ob&s;erved, that, though I was di&s;appointed in her, my addre&s;&s;es to her aunt would pro|bably kindle her into &s;en&s;ibility; as the old lady always allowed me to be very good na|tured,
<PB N="70" REF="032200_0048_0FF183D2F63B9350">
and not to have the lea&s;t &s;hare of harm in me.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till I had friends, numerous friends; and to them I was re&s;olved to apply. O Friend|&s;hip! thou fond &s;oother of the human brea&s;t, to thee we fly in every calamity; to thee the wretched &s;eek for &s;uccour; on thee the care-tired &s;on of mi&s;ery fondly relies; from thy kind a&s;&s;i&s;|tance the unfortunate always hopes relief, and may be ever &s;ure of&mdash;di&s;appointment! My fir&s;t application was to a city &s;crivener, who had fre|quently offered to lend me money, when he knew I did not want it. I informed him, that now was the time to put his friend&s;hip to the te&s;t; that I wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occa&s;ion, and was re&s;olved to take it up from him. And pray, Sir, cried my friend, do you want all this money? Indeed, I never wanted it more, returned I. I am &s;orry fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that, cries the &s;crivener, with all my heart; for they who want money when they come to borrow, will al|ways want money when they &s;hould come to pay.</P>
<P>From him I flew with indignation to one of the be&s;t friends I had in the world, and made the &s;ame reque&s;t. Indeed, Mr. Dry-bone, cries my friend, I always thought it would come to this. You know, Sir, I would not advi&s;e you but for your own good; but your conduct has hitherto been ridiculous in the highe&s;t degree, and &s;ome of your acquaintance always thought you a very &s;illy fel|low.
<PB N="71" REF="032200_0048_0FF183D2F63B9350">
Let me &s;ee&mdash;you want two hundred pounds; do you want only two hundred, Sir, exactly? To confe&s;s a truth, returned I, I &s;hall want three hundred; but then I have another friend, from whom I can borrow the re&s;t. Why then, repli|ed my friend, if you would take my advice&mdash;and you know I &s;hould not pre&s;ume to advi&s;e you but for your own good&mdash;I would recommend it to you to borrow the whole &s;um from that other friend; and then one note will &s;erve for all, you know.</P>
<P>Poverty now began to come fa&s;t upon me; yet in&s;tead of growing more provident or cautious as I grew poor, I became every day more indolent and &s;imple. A friend was arre&s;ted for fifty pounds; I was unable to extricate him, except by becoming his bail. When at liberty, he fled from his creditors, and left me to take his place. In pri&s;on I expected greater &s;atisfaction than I had enjoyed at large. I hoped to conver&s;e with men in this new world, &s;imple and believing like my&s;elf; but I found them as cunning and as cautious as tho&s;e in the world I had left behind. They &s;punged up my money whil&s;t it la&s;ted; borrowed my coal, and never paid them; and che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> me when I played at cribbage. All this was done becau&s;e they believed me to be very good-natured, and knew that I had no harm in me.</P>
<P>Upon my fir&s;t entrance into this man&s;ion which is to &s;ome the abode of di&s;pair; I felt no

&s;en&s;ations different from tho&s;e I experienced a|broad. I was now on one &s;ide the door, and tho&s;e who were unconfined were on the other; this was all the difference between us. At fir&s;t, indeed, I felt &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, in con&s;idering how I &s;hould be able to provide this week for the wants of the week en&s;uing; but after &s;ome time, if I found my&s;elf &s;ure of eating one day, I never troubled my head how I was to be &s;up|plied another. I &s;eized every precarious meal with the utmo&s;t good-humour, indulged no rants of &s;pleen at my &s;ituation, never called down heaven and all the &s;tars to behold me dining upon an half-penny-worth of radi&s;hes; my very com|panions were taught to believe, that I liked &s;al|lad better than mutton. I contented my&s;elf with thinking, that all my life I &s;hould either eat white bread or brown; con&s;idered that all that happen|ed was be&s;t, laughed when I was not in pain, took the world as it went, and read Tacitus of|ten, for want of more books and company.</P>
<P>How long I might have continued in this tor|pid &s;tate of &s;implicity, I cannot tell, had I not been rou&s;ed by &s;eeing an old acquaintance, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> knew to be a prudent blockhead, prefered to a place in the government. I now found that I had pur&s;ued a wrong track, and that the true way of being able to relieve others, was to aim at independence my&s;elf. My immediate care, therefore, was to leave my pre&s;ent habitation,
<PB N="73" REF="032200_0049_0FF183D70D771CF0">
and make an entire reformation in my conduct and behaviour. For a free, open, unde&s;igning deportment, I put on that of clo&s;ene&s;s, prudence and oeconomy. One of the mo&s;t heroic actions I ever performed, and for which I &s;hall prai&s;e my&s;elf as long as I live, was the refu&s;ing half a crown to an old acquaintance, at the time when he wanted it, and I had it to &s;pare; for this a|lone I de&s;erve to be decreed an ovation.</P>
<P>I now, therefore, pur&s;ued a cour&s;e of uninter|rupted frugality, &s;eldom wanted a dinner, and was con&s;equently invited to twenty. I &s;oon be|gan to get the character of a &s;aving hunks that had money; and in&s;en&s;ibly grew into e&s;teem. Neighbours have a&s;ked my advice in the di&s;po&s;al of their daughters, and I have always taken care not to give any. I have contracted a friend&s;hip with an alderman, only by ob&s;erving, that if we take a farthing from a thou&s;and pound, it will be a thou&s;and pound no longer. I have been invited to a pawnbroker's table, by pretending to hate gravy; and am now actually upon treaty of mar|riage with a rich widow, for only having ob&s;erv|ed that bread was ri&s;ing.

<HEAD>EDUCATING CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE ever found it a vain ta&s;k to try to make a child's learning its amu&s;ement; nor do I &s;ee what good end it would an&s;wer, were it actually attained. The child ought to have its
<PB N="81" REF="032200_0053_0FF183E2ADE72110">
&s;hare of play, and it will be benefited thereby; and for every rea&s;on, al&s;o, it ought to have its &s;hare of labour. The mind, by early labour, will be thus accu&s;tomed to fatigue and &s;ubordina|tion; and whatever be the per&s;on's future employ|ment in life, he will be better fitted to endure it, he will be thus enabled to &s;upport the drudgeries of office with content, or to fill up the vacancies of life with variety. The child, therefore, &s;hould by times be put to its duty; and we taught to know, that the ta&s;k is to be done, or the puni&s;h|ment to be endured. I do not object again&s;t al|luring it to duty by reward; but we well know, that the mind will be more &s;trongly &s;timulated by pain; and both may, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, take their turn to operate. In this manner a child, by playing with its equals abroad, and la|bouring with them at &s;chool, will acquire more health and knowledge than by being bred up un|der the wing of any &s;peculative &s;y&s;tem-maker; and will be thus qualified for a life of activity and obedience. It is true, indeed, that, when educated in this manner, the boy may not be &s;o &s;eemingly &s;en&s;ible and forward as one bred up under &s;olitary in&s;truction and, perhaps, this early forwardne&s;s is more engaging than u&s;eful.

her ha&s;te to be maried; but, concealing the cau&s;e of his mirth, civilly invited her home; adding, that he had a wife who might be capable of giv|ing her &s;ome con&s;olation. As &s;oon as he and his gue&s;t were returned, he imparted to <HI>Han&s;i</HI> in private what he had &s;een, and could not avoid expre&s;&s;ing his unea&s;ine&s;s, that &s;uch might be his own ca&s;e, if his deare&s;t wife &s;hould one day happen to &s;urvive him.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe <HI>Han&s;i'</HI>s re&s;entment at &s;o unkind a &s;u&s;picion. As her pa&s;&s;ion for him was not only great, but extremely delicate, &s;he employed tears, anger, frowns, and exclamati|ons, to chide his &s;u&s;picions: the widow her&s;elf was inveighed again&s;t; and <HI>Han&s;i</HI> declared &s;he was re&s;olved never to &s;leep under the &s;ame roof with a wretch, who, like, her, could be guilty of &s;uch barefaced incon&s;tancy. The night was cold and &s;tormy; however, the &s;tranger was oblig|ed to &s;eek another lodging, for <HI>Choang</HI> was not di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t, and <HI>Han&s;i</HI> would have her way.</P>
<P>The widow had &s;carce been gone an hour, when an old di&s;ciple of <HI>Choang'</HI>s whom he had not &s;een for many years, come to pay him a vi&s;it. He was received with the utmo&s;t ceremony, plac|ed in the mo&s;t honourable feat at &s;upper, and the wine began to circulate with great freedom. <HI>Cho|ang</HI> and <HI>Han&s;i</HI> exhibited open marks of mutual tenderne&s;s and unfeigned reconciliation: nothing could equal their apparant happine&s;s; &s;o found

an hu&s;band, &s;o obedient a wife, few could behold without regreting their own infelicity; when lo! their happine&s;s was at once di&s;turbed by a mo&s;t fatal accident. <HI>Choang</HI> fell lifele&s;s in an apoplec|tic fit upon the floor. Every method was u&s;ed, but in vain, for his recovery. <HI>Han&s;i</HI> was at fir&s;t incon&s;olable for his death: after &s;ome hours, however, &s;he found &s;pirits to read his la&s;t will. The en&s;uing day &s;he began to moralize and talk wi&s;dom; the next day &s;he was able to comfort the young di&s;ciple; and, on the third, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, they both agreed to be married.</P>
<P>There was no longer mourning in the apart|ments; the body of <HI>Choang</HI> was now thru&s;t into on old coffin, and placed in one of the meane&s;t rooms, there to lie unattended until the time pre|&s;cribed by law for his interment. In the mean time, <HI>Han&s;i,</HI> and the young di&s;ciple, were array|ed in the mo&s;t magnificent habits; the bride wore in her no&s;e a jewel of immen&s;e price, and her lover was dre&s;&s;ed in all the finery of his for|mer ma&s;ter, together with a pair of artificial whi&s;kers that reached down to his toes. The hour of their nuptials was arrived; the whole fa|mily &s;ympathi&s;ed with their approaching happi|ne&s;s; the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffu&s;ed the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite perfume, and a lu&s;tre more bright than noon-day. The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apart|ment, with impatience; when his &s;ervant ap|proaching
<PB N="90" REF="032200_0058_0FF183F1523E1310">
with terror in his countenance, inform|ed her, that his ma&s;ter was fallen into a fit, which would certainly be mortal, unle&s;s the heart of a man lately dead, could be obtained, and applied to his brea&s;t. She &s;carce waited to hear the end of his &s;tory, when, tucking up her clothes, &s;he run with a mattock in her hand to the coffin, where <HI>Choang</HI> lay, re&s;olving to apply the heart of her dead hu&s;band as a cure for the living. She therefore &s;truck the lid with the utmo&s;t violence. In a few blows the coffin flew open, when the body, which to all appearance had been dead, began to move, Terrified at the &s;ight, <HI>Han&s;i</HI> dropped the mattock, and <HI>Choang</HI> walked out, a&s;toni&s;hed at his own &s;ituation, his wife's un|u&s;ual magnificence, and here more amazing &s;ur|pri&s;e. He went among the apartments, unable to conceive the cau&s;e of &s;o much &s;plendour. He was not long in &s;u&s;pence, before his dome&s;tics informed him of every tran&s;action &s;ince he fir&s;t became in&s;en&s;ible. He could &s;carce believe what they told him, and went in pur&s;uit of <HI>Han&s;i</HI> her|&s;elf, in order to receive more certain information, or to reproach her infidelity. But &s;he prevented his reproaches: he found her weltering in blood for &s;he had &s;tabbed her&s;elf to the heart, being unable to &s;urvibe her &s;hame and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P><HI>Choang,</HI> being a philo&s;opher, was too wi&s;e to make any loud lamentations; he thought it be&s;t to bear his lo&s;s with &s;erenity; &s;o mending up the

<P>As they both were appri&s;ed of the foibles of each other before-hand, they knew how to ex|cu&s;e them after marriage. They lived together for many years in great tranquility, and not expecting rapture, made a &s;hift to find contentment.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few &s;ubjects which have been more written upon, and le&s;s under&s;tood, than that of Friend&s;hip. To follow the dictates of &s;ome, this virtue, in&s;tead of being the a&s;&s;uager of pain, becomes the &s;ource of every inconvenience. Such &s;peculati&s;ts, by expecting too much from friend|&s;hip, di&s;&s;olve the connection, and, by drawing the bands too clo&s;ely at length break them. Al|mo&s;t all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind; they per&s;uade us to friend&s;hips, which we find impo&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain to the la&s;t; &s;o that this &s;weetner of life, under proper regulations, is by their means, rendered inacce&s;&s;ible or unea&s;y. It is certain, the be&s;t method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it in &s;ome mea&s;ure, make it&s;elf; a &s;imilitude of minds or &s;tudies, and even &s;ome|times a diver&s;ity of pur&s;uits, will produce all the plea&s;ures that ari&s;e from it. The current of ten|derne&s;s widens, as it proceeds: and two men
<PB N="97" REF="032200_0061_0FF183F764CBA998">
imperceptibly find their hearts warm with good|nature for each other, when they were at fir&s;t only in pur&s;uit of mirth or relaxation.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip is like a debt of honour; the mo|ment it is talked of, it lo&s;es its real name, and a&s;&s;umes the more ungreatful form of obligation. From hence we find, that tho&s;e who regularly undertake to cultivate friend&s;hip, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That circle of being, which dependence gathers round us, is al|mo&s;t ever unfriendly; they &s;ecretly wi&s;h the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of their connexions more nearly equal; and, where they even have the mo&s;t virtue, are pre|pared to re&s;erve all their affections for their pa|tron, only in the hour of his decline. Increa&s;ing the obligations which are laid upon &s;uch minds, only increa&s;es their burthen; they feel them&s;elves unable to repay the immen&s;ity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent re&s;ent|ment at the hand that it &s;tretched out with offers of &s;ervice and relief.</P>
<P><HI>Plautinus</HI> was a man who thought that every good was brought from riches; and as he was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of great wealth, and had a mind naturaly formed for virtue, he re&s;olved to gather a circle of the be&s;t men round him. Among the number of his dependants was <HI>Mu&s;idorus,</HI> with a mind ju&s;t as fond of virtue, yet not le&s;s proud than his pa|tron. His circum&s;tances, however, were &s;uch as forced him to &s;toop to the good offices of his &s;u|perior,
<PB N="98" REF="032200_0062_0FF183FA3A053DB0">
and he &s;aw him&s;elf daily among a num|ber of others loaded with benefits and prote&s;tati|ons of friend&s;hip. The&s;e, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of the world, he thought it prudent to accept; but, while he gave his e&s;teem, he could not give his heart. A want of affection breaks out in the mo&s;t trifling in&s;tances, and <HI>Plautinus</HI> had &s;kill enough to ob&s;erve the minute&s;t actions of the man he wi&s;hed to make his friend. In the&s;e he ever found his aim di&s;appointed; for <HI>Mu&s;idorus</HI> claim|ed an exchange of hearts which <HI>Plautinus,</HI> &s;oli|cited by a variety of claims, could never think of be&s;towing.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, that the re&s;erve of our poor proud man, was &s;oon con&s;trued into ingratitude: and &s;uch, indeed, in the common acceptation of the world it was. Wherever <HI>Mu&s;idorus</HI> appeared, he was remarked as the ungrateful man; he had accepted favours, it was &s;aid, and had &s;till the in&s;olence to pretend to in|dependance. The event, however, ju&s;tified his conduct. <HI>Plautinus,</HI> by mi&s;placed liberality, at length became poor; and it was then that <HI>Mu|&s;idorus</HI> fir&s;t thought of making a friend of him. He flew to the man of fallen fortune, with an offer of all he had; wrought under his direction with a&s;&s;iduity; and by uniting their talents, both were at length placed in that &s;tate of life from which one of them had formerly fallen.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="032200_0062_0FF183FA3A053DB0">
To this &s;tory, taken from modern life, I &s;hall add one more, taken from a Greek writer of an|tiquity:&mdash;'Two Jewi&s;h &s;oldiers, in the time of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> had made many campaigns together; and a participation of dangers, at length, bred an union of hearts. They were remarked through|out the whole army, as the two friendly brothers; they felt and fought for each other. Their friend|&s;hip might have continued, without interruption, till death, had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other, which was in his promotion to be a Centurion under the fa|mous John, who headed a particular party of the Jewi&s;h male-contents.</P>
<P>From this moment their former love was con|verted into the mo&s;t inveterate enmity. They at|tached them&s;elves to oppo&s;ite factions, and &s;ought each other's lives in the conflict of adver&s;e party. In this manner they continued for more than two years, vowing mutual revenge, and animated with an unconquerable &s;pirit of aver&s;ion. At length, however, that party of the <HI>Jews,</HI> to which the mean &s;oldier belonged, joining with the <HI>Romans,</HI> it became victorious, and drove <HI>John,</HI> with all his adherents, into the Temple. Hi&s;tory has given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that &s;uperb edifice. The <HI>Roman</HI> &s;oldiers were gathered round it; the whole <HI>Temple</HI> was in flames, and thou&s;ands were &s;een amid&s;t them within its &s;acred circuit. It
<PB N="100" REF="032200_0063_0FF183FFD3111A80">
was in this &s;ituation of things, that the now-&s;uc|ce&s;sful &s;oldier &s;aw his former friend upon the bat|tlements of the highe&s;t tower, looking round with horror, and ju&s;t ready to be con&s;umed with flames.

The Centurion from above heard and obeyed, and, ca&s;ting him&s;elf from the top of the tower, into his fellow-&s;oldiers's arms, both fell a &s;acrifice on the &s;pot; one being cru&s;h|ed to death by the weight of his companion, and the other da&s;hed to pieces by the greatne&s;s of his fall.'</P>

<P>He was, indeed, &s;uperior to her in fortune; but that defect on her &s;ide was &s;o amply &s;upplied by her merit, that none was thought more wor|thy of his regards than &s;he.

<P>She continually laboured to di&s;turb an union &s;o firmly, &s;o affectionately founded, and planned every &s;cheme which &s;he thought mo&s;t likely to di&s;turb it.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;eemed willing to promote her unju&s;t intentions; the circum&s;tances of <HI>Sabinus</HI> had been long embarra&s;&s;ed by a tedious law-&s;uit, and the court determining the cau&s;e unexpectedly in favour of his opponent, it &s;unk his fortune to the lowe&s;t pitch of penury from the highe&s;t afflu|ence.</P>

<PB N="104" REF="032200_0065_0FF184034CAEB828">
&s;o high a price: <HI>Ariana</HI> was no le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed to find her offers rejected, and give a loo&s;e to all that warmth which &s;he had long endavoured to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>Reproach generally produces recrimination; the quarrel ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that <HI>Sabinus</HI> was marked for de&s;truction; and the very next day, upon the &s;trength of an old family debt, he was &s;ent to jail, with none but <HI>Olinda</HI> to comfort him in his mi&s;eries. In this man&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s they lived together with re&s;ignation, and even with comfort. She provided the frugal meal, and he read for her while employed in the little offices of dome&s;tic concern. Their fellow-pri&s;oners admired their contentment, and whenever they had a de&s;ire of relaxing into mirth, and enjoying tho&s;e little comforts that a pri&s;on affords, <HI>Sabinus</HI> and <HI>Olinda</HI> were &s;ure to be of the party. In&s;tead of reproaching each for their mutual wretchedne&s;s, they both lightened it, by bearing each a &s;hare of the load impo&s;ed by providence. Whenever <HI>Sabinus</HI> &s;hewed the lea&s;t concern on his dear partner's account, &s;he con|jured him by the love he bore her; by tho&s;e tender ties which now united them for ever, not to di&s;compo&s;e him&s;elf: that &s;o long as his affection la&s;ted, &s;he defied all the ills of fortune, and every lo&s;s of fame or friend&s;hip: that no|thing could make her mi&s;erable, but his &s;eem|ing

<P>A propo&s;al of &s;o ba&s;e a nature filled our un|happy couple with horror; they ordered the me&s;|&s;enger immediately out of the room, and falling upon each other's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> indulged an agony of &s;orrow: for now even all hopes of relief were bani&s;hed.

<P>This lady, though warped by wrong pa&s;&s;ions, was naturally kind, judicious and friendly. She found that all her attempts to &s;hake the con&s;tancy or the integrity of <HI>Sabinus</HI> were ineffectual. She had, therefore, begun to reflect, and to wonder

how &s;he could, &s;o long and &s;o unprovoked, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|jure &s;uch uncommon fortitude and affection.</P>
<P>She had, from the next room, her&s;elf heard the reception given to the me&s;&s;enger, and could not avoid feeling all the force of &s;uperior vir|tue; &s;he therefore rea&s;&s;umed her former goodne&s;s of heart; &s;he came into the room with tears in her eyes, and acknowledged the &s;everity of her former treatment.

Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occa|&s;ion, there appeared a maje&s;tic old man, who, falling at the emperor's feet, addre&s;&s;ed him as follows: "Great father of <HI>China,</HI> behold a wretch, now eighty-five years old, who was &s;hut up in a dungeon at the age of twenty-two. I was impri&s;oned, though a &s;tranger to crime, or without being even confronted by my accu|&s;ers.

Permit me then, O <HI>Chinvang,</HI> to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former pri&s;on: the walls of my dungeon are to me more plea&s;ing than the mo&s;t &s;plendid palace; I have not long to live, and &s;hall be unhappy except I &s;pend the re&s;t of my days where my youth was pa&s;&s;ed; in that pri&s;on from whence you were plea&s;ed to relea&s;e me."</P>

<HEAD>DR. PRIMROSE's ADDRESS TO HIS FELLOW-PRISONERS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE EQUAL DEALINGS OF PROVIDENCE DE|MONSTRATED WITH REGARD TO THE HAP|PY AND THE MISERABLE HERE BELOW. THAT FROM THE NATURE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN, THE WRETCHED MUST BE REPAID THE BALANCE OF THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LIFE HEREAFTER.</HEAD>
<P>MY friends, my children, and fellow-&s;uffer|ers, when I reflect on the di&s;tribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to enjoy, yet &s;till more to &s;uffer. Though we &s;hould examine the whole world, we &s;hall not find one man &s;o happy as to have nothing left to wi&s;h for; but we daily &s;ee thou|&s;ands, who, by &s;uicide, &s;hew us they have no|thing left to hope. In this life, then, it ap|pears that we cannot be entirely ble&s;t; but yet we may be completely mi&s;erable!</P>
<P>Why man &s;hould thus feel pain; why our wretchedne&s;s &s;hould be requi&s;ite in the formation of univer&s;al felicity; why, when all other &s;y&s;tems are made perfect only by the perfection of their &s;ubordinate parts, the great &s;y&s;tem &s;hould require for its perfection, parts that are not only &s;ubordi|nate to others, but imperfect in them&s;elves!&mdash;
<PB N="120" REF="032200_0073_0FF1841C9DF05268">
The&s;e are que&s;tions that never can be explain|ed, and might be u&s;ele&s;s if known. On this &s;ubject, Providence has thought fit to elude our curio&s;ity, &s;atisfied with granting us motives to con&s;olation.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, man has called in the friend|ly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Philo&s;ophy; and Heaven, &s;ee|ing the incapacity of that to con&s;ole him, has given him the aid of Religion. The con&s;olati|on of Philo&s;ophy are very amu&s;ing, but often fal|lacious. It tells us, that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them; and, on on the other hand, that though we unavoidable have mi&s;eries here, life is &s;hort, and they will &s;oon be over. Thus do the&s;e con&s;olations de|&s;troy each other; for if life is a place of com|fort, its &s;hortne&s;s mu&s;t be mi&s;ery; and, if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philo&s;o|phy is weak; but religion comforts in an higher &s;train. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and prepairing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body, and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making him&s;elf a heaven of happine&s;s here; while the wretch that has been maimed and con|taminated by his vices, &s;hrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengence of Heaven. To Religion, then, we mu&s;t hold, in every circum&s;tance of life, for our true&s;t comfort; for, if already we are happy,
<PB N="121" REF="032200_0073_0FF1841C9DF05268">
it is a plea&s;ure to think that we can make that happine&s;s unending; and, if we are mi&s;erable, it it very con&s;oling to think that there is a place of re&s;t. Thus, to the fortunate, Religion holds out a continuance of bli&s;s: to the wretched, a change from pain.</P>
<P>But, though Religion is very kind to all men, it has promi&s;ed peculiar rewards to the unhap|py; the &s;ick, the naked, the hou&s;ele&s;s, the heavy-laden, and the pri&s;oner, have ever mo&s;t frequent promi&s;es in our &s;acred law. The Author of our Religion every where profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the wretch's friend; and, unlike the fal&s;e ones of this world, be&s;tows all his care&s;&s;es upon the for|lorn. The unthinking have cen&s;ured this as a partiality, as a preference without merit to de|&s;erve it; but they never reflect, that it is not in the power even of Heaven it&s;elf to make the offer of uncea&s;ing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the mi&s;erable. To the fir&s;t, eterni|ty is but a &s;ingle ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ince, at mo&s;t, it but increa&s;es what they already po&s;&s;e&s;s. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it dimini&s;hes their pain here, and rewards them with heaven|ly bli&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>But Providence is in another re&s;pect kinder to the poor than the rich; for, as it thus makes the life after death more de&s;irable, &s;o it &s;mooths the pa&s;&s;age there. The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man
<PB N="122" REF="032200_0074_0FF18422511FF110">
of &s;orrow lays him&s;elf quietly down; he has no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to regret, and but few ties to &s;top his departure; he feels only Nature's pang in the final &s;eparation, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for, after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the con&s;titution, nature kind|ly covers with in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Thus Providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dying, and, in Heaven, all the &s;upe|riority of plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from contra&s;ted enjoyment. And this &s;uperiority, my friends, is no &s;mall advantage, and &s;eems to be one of the plea&s;ures of the poor man in the parable; for, though he was already in Heaven, and felt all the raptures it could give, yet it was men|tioned as an addition to his happine&s;s, that he had once been wretched, and now was com|forted; that he had known what it was to be mi&s;erable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, my friends, you &s;ee Religion does what Philo&s;ophy could never do: it &s;hews the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the un|happy, and levels all human enjoyments to near|ly the &s;ame &s;tandard. It gives to both rich and poor the &s;ame happine&s;s hereafter, and equal hopes to a&s;pire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying plea&s;ure here, the poor have the endle&s;s &s;atisfaction of know|ing
<PB N="123" REF="032200_0074_0FF18422511FF110">
what it was once to be mi&s;erable, when crowned with endle&s;s felicity hereafter; and even though this &s;hould be called a &s;mall advan|tage, yet, being an eternal one, it mu&s;t make up, by duration, what the temporal happine&s;s of the great may have exceeded by inten&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e are, therefore, the con&s;olations which the wretched have peculiar to them&s;elves, and in which they are above the re&s;t of mankind; in other re&s;pects they are below them. They who would know the mi&s;eries of the poor, mu&s;t &s;ee life and endure it. To declaim on the tem|poral advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believed or practi&s;e. The men who have the nece&s;&s;aries of living are not poor, and they who want them mu&s;t be mi&s;era|ble. Yes, my friends, we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can &s;oothe the wants of nature, can give ela&s;tic &s;weet|ne&s;s to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ea&s;e to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the Philo&s;opher from his couch of &s;oftne&s;s tell us that we can re&s;i&s;t all the&s;e. Alas! the effort by which we re&s;i&s;t them is &s;till the greate&s;t pain! Death is &s;light, and any man may &s;ub&s;tain it; but torments are dreadful, and the&s;e no man can endure.</P>
<P>To us, then, my friends, the promi&s;es of happine&s;s in Heaven &s;hould be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are
<PB N="124" REF="032200_0075_0FF1842402005058">
then, indeed, of all men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. When I look round the&s;e gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us; this light that only &s;erves to &s;hew the horrors of the place, tho&s;e &s;hackles that tyranny has impo&s;ed, or crimes made nece&s;&s;ary; when I &s;urvey the&s;e emaciated looks, and hear tho&s;e groans, O my friends, what a glorious exchange would Heaven be for the&s;e! To fly through regions unconfin|ed as air; to ba&s;k in the &s;un&s;hine of eternal bli&s;s; to carol over endle&s;s hymns of prai&s;e; to have no ma&s;ter to threaten or in&s;ult us, but the form of Goodne&s;s him&s;elf for ever in our eyes; when I think of the&s;e things, Death becomes the me&s;&s;enger of very glad tidings; when I think of the&s;e things, his &s;harpe&s;t arrow becomes the &s;taff of my &s;upport; when I think of the&s;e things, what is there in life worth having? when I think of the&s;e things, what is there that &s;hould not be &s;purned away? Kings in their palaces &s;hould groan for &s;uch advantages; but we, humbled as we are, &s;hould yearn for them.</P>
<P>And &s;hall the&s;e things be ours? Ours they will certainly be, if we but try for them; and, what is a comfort, we are &s;hut up from many temptations that would retard our pur&s;uit. Only let us try for them, and they will certainly be ours, and, what is &s;till a comfort, &s;hortly too; for, if we look back on pa&s;t life, it appears but a very &s;hort &s;pan; and, whatever we may think
<PB N="125" REF="032200_0075_0FF1842402005058">
of the re&s;t of life, it will yet be found of le&s;s duration: as we grow older, the days &s;eem to grow &s;horter, and our intimacy with time ever le&s;&s;ens the perception of his &s;tay. Then let us take comfort now, for we &s;hall &s;oon be at our journey's end; we &s;hall &s;oon lay down the heavy burthen laid by Heaven upon us; and though Death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and, like his horizon, &s;till flies before him; yet the time will certainly and &s;hortly come, when be &s;hall cea&s;e from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world &s;hall no more tread us to the earth; when we &s;hall think with plea&s;ure on our &s;ufferings below; when we &s;hall be &s;urrounded with all our friends, or &s;uch as de&s;erved our friend&s;hip; when our bli&s;s &s;hall be unutterable, and &s;till, to crown all, unending.</P>

<HEAD>STORY OF COLONEL. M&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>AT the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of peace at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> Col. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;was one of the thoughtle&s;s, agreeable, gay creatures, that drew the atten|tion of the company at <HI>Bath.</HI> He danced and talked with great vivacity; and when he gamed among the ladies, he &s;howed, that his attention was employed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes. His own fortune, however was a trifle, when compared to the elegance of his expence; and his imprudence at la&s;t was &s;o great that it oblidged him to &s;ell an

annuity, ari&s;ing from his commi&s;&s;ion, to keep up his &s;plendor a little longer.</P>
<P>However thoughtle&s;s he might be, he had the happine&s;s of gaining the affections of Mi&s;s <HI>L</HI>&mdash;, who&s;e father de&s;igned her a very large fortune. This lady was courted by a nobleman of di&s;tinc+tion; but &s;he refu&s;ed his addre&s;&s;es, re&s;olved up|on gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice. The intrigue went on &s;ucce&s;sfully be|tween her and the Colonel, and they both would certainly have been married, and been undone, had not Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> appri&s;ed her father of their intentions. The old gentleman recalled his daughter from <HI>Bath,</HI> and offered Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> a very con&s;iderable pre&s;ent, for the care he had ta|ken, which he refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mean time Col. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;had an inti|mation how his intrigue came to be di&s;covered; and by taxing Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> found that his &s;u&s;pici|ons were not without foundation. A challenge was the immediate con&s;equence; which the King of <HI>Bath,</HI> con&s;cious of having only done his duty, thought proper to decline. As none are permitted to wear &s;words at <HI>Bath,</HI> the Co|lonel found no opportunity of gratifying his re|&s;entment, and waited with impatience to find Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> in town, to require proper &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>During this interval, however, he found his creditors became too importunate for him to re|main longer at <HI>Bath;</HI> and his finances and cre|dit

She thought her&s;elf now di&s;engaged from her former pa&s;&s;ion. An ab&s;ence of two years had in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated her love for the Colonel; and the a&s;&s;iduity, the merit, and real regard, of the gentleman who &s;till continu|ed to &s;olicit her, were almo&s;t too powerful for her con&s;tancy, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> in the mean time, took every opportunity of enquiring after Col, <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, and found that he had for &s;ome time been returned to <HI>England,</HI> but changed his name, in order to avoid the fury of his credi|tors; and that he was entered into a company of &s;trolling players, who were at that time ex|hibiting at <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>
<P>He now therefore thought he owed the Colo|nel, in ju&s;tice, an opportunity of promoting his fortune, as he had once deprived him of an occa&s;ion of &s;atsfying his love. Our Beau, there|fore

The propo&s;al being ac|cepted, the lady, the nobleman, and Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> arrived in town ju&s;t as the players were going to begin.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, who u&s;ed every means of re|maining <HI>incognito,</HI> and who was too proud to make his di&s;tre&s;&s;es known to any of his former acquaintances, was now degraded into the cha|racter of <HI>Tom</HI> in the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>L</HI>&mdash;was placed in the foremo&s;t row of the &s;pectators, her lord on one &s;ide, and the impa|tient <HI>Na&s;h</HI> on the other, when the unhappy youth appeared in that de&s;picable &s;ituation upon the &s;tage.

Thus, after a full in|dulgence of any one &s;en&s;e, the man of plea&s;ure finds a langour in all, is placed in a cha&s;m be|tween pa&s;t and expected enjoyment, preceives an interval which mu&s;t be filled up. The pre&s;ent
<PB N="144" REF="032200_0085_0FF18441CAD94860">
can give no &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e he has already robbed it of every charm. A mind thus left without immediate employment, naturally recurs to the pa&s;t or the future: the reflector finds that he was happy, and knows that he cannot be &s;o now; he &s;ees that he may yet be happy, and wi&s;hes the hour was come: thus every period of his continuance is mi&s;erable, except that very &s;hort one of immediate gratification. In&s;tead of a life of di&s;&s;ipation, none has more frequent con|ver&s;ations with di&s;agreeable <HI>&s;elf</HI> than he: his enthu&s;ia&s;ms are but few and tran&s;ient; his appe|tites, like angry creditors, continually making fruitle&s;s demands for what he is unable to pay; and the greater his former plea&s;ure, the more &s;trong his regret, the more impatient his expec|tations. A life of plea&s;ure is, therefore, the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing life in the world.</P>
<P>Habit has rendered the man of bu&s;ine&s;s more cool in his de&s;ires; he finds le&s;s regret for pa&s;t plea&s;ures, and le&s;s &s;olicitude for the&s;e to come. The life he now leads, though tainted in &s;ome mea&s;ure with hope, is yet not afflicted &s;o &s;trongly with regret, and is le&s;s divided between &s;hort-lived rapture and la&s;ting angui&s;h. The plea&s;ures he has enjoyed are not &s;o vivid, and tho&s;e he has to expect cannot con&s;equently create &s;o much anxiety.</P>

what has already affected, or may hereafter affect him&s;elf; the concerns of others make his whole &s;tudy, and that &s;tudy is his plea&s;ure; and this plea&s;ure is continuing in its nature, becau&s;e it can be changed at will, leaving but few of the&s;e anxi|ous intervals which are employed in remem|brance or anticipation. The philo&s;opher, by this means, leads a life of almo&s;t continued di&s;&s;ipa|tion; and reflection, which makes the unea&s;ine&s;s and mi&s;ery of others, &s;erves as a companion and in&s;tructor to him.</P>
<P>In a word, po&s;itive happine&s;s is con&s;titution|al, and incapable of increa&s;e; mi&s;ery is arti|ficial, and generally proceeds from our folly. Philo&s;ophy can add to our happine&s;s in no other manner, but by dimini&s;hing our mi&s;ery: it &s;hould not pretend to increa&s;e our pre&s;ent &s;tock, but make us oeconomi&s;ts of what we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The great &s;ource of calamity lies in regret or anticipation: he, therefore, is mo&s;t wi&s;e, who thinks of the pre&s;ent alone, regardle&s;s of the pa&s;t or the future. This is impo&s;&s;ible to the man of plea&s;ure; it is difficult to the man of bu&s;ine&s;s; and is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, attainable by the philo&s;opher.

<P>IT is u&s;ually &s;aid by grammarians, that the u&s;e of language is to expre&s;s our wants and de|&s;ires; but men who know the world, hold, and I think with &s;ome &s;hew of rea&s;on, that he who be&s;t knows how to keep his nece&s;&s;ities private, is the mo&s;t likely per&s;on to have them redre&s;&s;ed; and that the true u&s;e of &s;peech is not &s;o much to expre&s;s our wants as to conceal them.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favours, there ap|pears &s;omething &s;o attractive in riches, that the
<PB N="150" REF="032200_0088_0FF1844947BA5138">
large heap generally collects from the &s;maller: and the poor find as much plea&s;ure in increa&s;ing the enormous ma&s;s of the rich, as the mi&s;er, who owns it, &s;ees happine&s;s in its increa&s;e. Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of morality. <HI>Seneca</HI> him&s;elf allows, that in confering benefits, the pre&s;ent &s;hould always be &s;uited to the dignity of the receiver. Thus the rich receive large pre&s;ents, and are thank|ed for accepting them. Men of middling &s;ta|tions are obliged to be content with pre&s;ents &s;omething le&s;s; while the beggar, who may be truly &s;aid to want indeed, is well paid if a farthing rewards his warme&s;t &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>Every man who has &s;een the world, and has had his ups and downs in life, as the expre&s;&s;ion is, mu&s;t have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine; and mu&s;t know, that to have much, or to &s;eem to have it, is the only way to have more. <HI>Ovid</HI> finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column; the lower it &s;inks, the greater is that weight it is obliged to &s;u&s;tain. Thus, when a man's circum&s;tances are &s;uch that he has no occa&s;ion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him; but, &s;hould his wants be &s;uch that he &s;ues for a trifle, it is two to one whether he may be tru&s;ted with the &s;malle&s;t &s;um. A certain young fellow, whom I knew, whenever he had occa&s;ion to a&s;k his friend for a guinea, u&s;ed to prelude his reque&s;t as if he
<PB N="151" REF="032200_0088_0FF1844947BA5138">
wanted two hundred; and talked &s;o familiarly of large &s;ums, that none could ever think he wanted a &s;mall one. The &s;ame gentleman, when|ever he wanted credit for a &s;uit of clothes, al|ways made the propo&s;al in a laced coat; for he found by experience, that, if he appeared &s;habby on the&s;e occa&s;ions, his tailor had taken an oath again&s;t tru&s;ting; or, what was every whit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and &s;hould not be at home for &s;ome time</P>
<P>There can be no inducements to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and, by this means, relief; but before a poor man opens his mind in &s;uch circum&s;tances, he &s;hould fir&s;t con&s;ider whe|ther he is contented to lo&s;e the e&s;teem of the per&s;on he &s;olicits, and whether he is willing to give up friend&s;hip to excite compa&s;&s;ion. Pity and Friend&s;hip are pa&s;&s;ions incompatible with each other; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that both can re&s;ide in any brea&s;t for the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, with|out impairing each other. Friend&s;hip is made up of e&s;teem and plea&s;ure; Pity is compo&s;ed of &s;orrow and contempt; the mind may, for &s;ome time, fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both at once.</P>
<P>In fact, Pity, though it may often relieve, is but, at be&s;t, a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eldom affords di&s;tre&s;s more than a tran&s;itory a&s;&s;i&s;tance: with &s;ome it &s;carce la&s;ts from the fir&s;t impul&s;e till the hand can be put into the pocket; with
<PB N="152" REF="032200_0089_0FF1844C2A788F00">
others, it may continue for twice that &s;pace; and on &s;ome, of extraordinary &s;en&s;ibility, I have &s;een it operate for half an hour together: but &s;till, la&s;t as it may, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this motive, we give five farthings, from others, we give pounds. Whatever be our feelings from the fir&s;t impul&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, when the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s &s;olicits a &s;econd, we then feel with dimini&s;hed &s;en&s;ibility; and, like the repetition of an echo, every &s;troke becomes weaker; 'till, at la&s;t, our &s;en&s;ations lo&s;e all mixture of &s;orrow, and degen|erate into downright contempt.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peculations bring to my mind the fate of a very good-natured fellow, who is now no more. He was bred in a compting-hou&s;e, and his father dying ju&s;t as he was out of his time, left him an hand&s;ome fortune, and many friends to advi&s;e with. The re&s;traint in which my friend had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which &s;ome regarded as pru|dence; and, from &s;uch con&s;iderations, he had every day repeated offers of friend&s;hip. Such as had money, were ready to offer him their a&s;&s;i&s;tance that way; and they who had daugh|ters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, ad|vi&s;ed him to marry. My friend, however, was in good circum&s;tances; he wanted neither mo|ney, friends, nor a wife; and, therefore, mode&s;t|ly declined their propo&s;als.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="032200_0089_0FF1844C2A788F00">
Some errors, however, in the management of his affairs, and &s;everal lo&s;&s;es in trade, &s;oon brought him to a different way of thinking; and he at la&s;t con&s;idered, that it was his be&s;t way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable. His fir&s;t addre&s;s was to a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A few lines her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> are borrowed, with a &s;light alteration, from the Man of the World, p.</HI> 65. <HI>of this Volume.</HI></NOTE> &s;crivener, who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friend&s;hip, at a time when, perhaps, he knew tho&s;e offers would have been refu&s;ed. As a man, therefore, confident of not being refu&s;ed, he reque&s;ted the u&s;e of a hundred guineas for a few days, as he ju&s;t then had occa|&s;ion for money. <Q>And pray, Sir, replied the &s;crivener, do you want all this money?</Q> <Q>Want it, Sir? &s;ays the other, If I did not want it, I &s;hould not have a&s;ked it.</Q> <Q>I am &s;orry for that, &s;ays the friend; for tho&s;e who want money when they borrow, will always want money when they &s;hould come to pay. To &s;ay the truth, Sir, money is money now; and, I believe, it is all &s;unk in the bottom of the &s;ea, for my part; he that has got a little, is a fool if he does not keep what he has got.</Q></P>
<P>Not quite di&s;concerted by this refu&s;al, our adventurer was re&s;olved to apply to another,
<PB N="154" REF="032200_0090_0FF1845042176298">
who he knew was the very be&s;t friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addre&s;&s;ed, received his propo&s;al with all the affa|bility that could be expected from generous friend&s;hip. <Q>Let me &s;ee&mdash;you want an hundred guineas&mdash;and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty an&s;wer?</Q> <Q>If you have but fifty to &s;pare, Sir, I mu&s;t be contented.</Q> <Q>Fifty to &s;pare! I do not &s;ay that; for, I believe, I have but twenty about me.</Q> <Q>Then I mu&s;t borrow the other thirty from &s;ome other friend.</Q> <Q>And pray, replied the friend, would it not be the be&s;t way to borrow the whole mo|ney from that other friend, and then one note will &s;erve for all, you know?&mdash;You know, my dear Sir, that you need make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend; and, when you chu&s;e a bit of dinner, or &s;o&mdash;You, Tom! &s;ee the gentleman down. You won't forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble &s;ervant.</Q></P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but not di&s;couraged, at this treat|ment, he was at la&s;t re&s;olved to find that a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from love, which he could not have from friend&s;hip. A young lady, a di&s;tant relation by the mother's &s;ide, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as &s;he had already made all the ad|vances that her &s;ex's mode&s;ty would permit, he made his propo&s;al with confidence. He &s;oon, however, preceived, That no bankrupt ever

found the fair-one kind. She had lately fallen deeply in love with another, who had more money, and the whole neighbourhood thought it would be a match.</P>
<P>Every day now began to &s;trip my poor friend of his former finery; his cloaths flew, piece by piece, to the pawnbroker's, and he &s;eemed, at length, equipped in the genuine livery of mis|fortune. But &s;till he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from actual nece&s;&s;ity; the numberle&s;s invitations he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad received to dine, even after his lo&s;&s;es, were yet unan&s;wered: he was therefore now re&s;olved to accept of a dinner, becau&s;e he want|ed one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week, without being openly affronted. The la&s;t place I &s;aw him in, was at a reverend divine's. He had, as he fancied, ju&s;t nicked the time of dinner; for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being de&s;ired, and talked for &s;ome time without being attended to. He a&s;&s;ured the company, that nothing procured &s;o good an appetite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that morning. He went on, and prai&s;ed the figure of the dama&s;k table-cloth; talked of a fea&s;t where he had been the day before, but that the veni&s;on was over-done: but all this procured him no invitation. Finding, therefore, the gentleman of the hou&s;e in&s;en&s;ible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at la&s;t, to retire,
<PB N="156" REF="032200_0091_0FF1849161086008">
and mend his appetite by a &s;econd walk in the Park.</P>
<P>You, then, O ye beggars of my acquaintance, whether in rags or lace; whether in <HI>Kent-&s;treet</HI> or the <HI>Mall;</HI> whether at the <HI>Smyrna</HI> or St. <HI>Giles'</HI>s; might I be permitted to advi&s;e as a friend, never &s;eem to want the favour which you &s;olicit. Apply to every pa&s;&s;ion but human pity for redre&s;s: you may find permanent relief from vanity, from &s;elf-intere&s;t, or from avarice; but from compa&s;&s;ion never. The very eloquence of a poor man is di&s;gu&s;ting; and that mouth which is opened even by wi&s;dom, is &s;eldom expected to clo&s;e without the horrors of a petition.</P>
<P>To ward off the gripe of poverty, you mu&s;t pretend to be a &s;tranger to her, and &s;he will at lea&s;t u&s;e you with ceremony.

If, again, you are obliged to wear flim&s;y &s;tuff in the mid&s;t of winter, be the fir&s;t to remark, that &s;tuffs are very much worn at <HI>Paris;</HI> or, if there be found &s;ome irreparable defects in any part of your equi|page, which cannot be concealed by all the arts of &s;itting cro&s;slegged, coaxing, or darning, &s;ay, that neither you nor <HI>Samp&s;on Gideon</HI> were ever

In &s;hort, however caught, never give out; but a&s;cribe to the frugality of your di&s;po&s;ition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowne&s;s of your circum&s;tances. To be poor, and to &s;eem poor, is a certain method never to ri&s;e: pride in the great is hateful; in the wi&s;e, it is ridiculous; but beggarly pride is a rational vanity, which I have been taught to ap|plaud and excu&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE DISABLED SOLDIER.</HEAD>
<P>NO ob&s;ervation is more common, and at the &s;ame time more true, than that one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives. The misfortunes of the great are held up to en|gage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of declamation; and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble &s;ufferers: the great, under the pre&s;&s;ure of calamity, are con&s;cious of &s;everal others &s;ympathizing with their di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="032200_0092_0FF18453290C6858">
There is nothing magnanimous in bearing misfortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: man in &s;uch circum&s;tances will act bravely, even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of ob&s;curity, can brave adver&s;ity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes, can behave with tran|quillity and indifference, is truly great: whether pea&s;ant or courtier, he de&s;erves admiration, and &s;hould be held up for our imitation and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>While the &s;lighte&s;t inconveniences of the great are magnified into calamities, while Tragedy mouths out their &s;ufferings in all the &s;trains of eloquence, the mi&s;eries of the poor are entirly di&s;regarded; and yet &s;ome of the lower ranks of people undergo more real hard&s;hips in one day, than tho&s;e of a more exalted &s;tation &s;uffer in their whole lives. It is inconceivable what dif|ficulties the meane&s;t of our common &s;ailors and &s;oldiers endure, without murmuring or regret; without pa&s;&s;ionately declaiming again&s;t provi|dence, or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.

earth, to which they had fooli&s;hly attached an idea of happine&s;s! Their di&s;tre&s;&s;es were plea&s;ures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring. They ate, drink, and &s;leep; they have &s;laves to attend them, and were &s;ure of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for life: while many of their fellow-creatures are obliged to wander without a friend to comfort or a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and even without &s;helter from the &s;eve|rity of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have been led into the&s;e reflections, from ac|cidentally meeting, &s;ome days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's jacket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been hone&s;t and indu&s;trous when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I de&s;ired to know the hi&s;tory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. The di&s;abled &s;oldier, for &s;uch he was, though dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's habit, &s;cratching his head, and leaning on his cruch, put him&s;elf into an attitude to comply with my reque&s;t, and gave me his hi&s;tory, as follows.</P>
<P>"AS for my misfortune, ma&s;ter, I can't pre|tend to have gone through any more than other folks; for, except the lo&s;s of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,

thank Heaven, that I have to complain; there is <HI>Bill Tibbs,</HI> of our regiment, he has lo&s;t both his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank Heav|en, it is not &s;o bad with me yet.</P>
<P>"I was born in <HI>Shrop&s;hire;</HI> my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old; &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wandering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;hioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belonged, or where I was born; &s;o they &s;ent me to another pa|ri&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept &s;ending me about &s;o long, that they would not let me be born in any pari&s;h at all; but, at la&s;t, however, they fixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and was re&s;olved, at lea&s;t, to know my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the work hou&s;e put me to bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an ea&s;y kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e, for fear, as they &s;aid, I &s;hould run away. But what of that? I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died, when I was obliged
<PB N="161" REF="032200_0093_0FF18454CF95CEA0">
to provide for my&s;elf; &s;o I was re&s;olved to go &s;eek my fortune.</P>
<P>"In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and &s;tarv|ed when I could get none; when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a ju&s;tice of peace, I &s;pied a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it. Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bring|ing it away, when the ju&s;tice him&s;elf met me: he called me a poacher and a villain; and, col|laring me de&s;ired I would give an account of my&s;elf. I fell upon my knees, begged his wor|&s;hip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, &s;eed, and ge|neration; but, though I gave a very true ac|count, the ju&s;tice &s;aid I could give no account; &s;o I was indicted at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent up to <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> in order to be tran&s;ported as a vagabond.</P>
<P>"People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found <HI>Newgate</HI> as a|greeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever; &s;o I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board a &s;hip, and &s;ent, off, with two hundred more, to the plantations. We had but an indifferent pa&s;&s;age; for, being
<PB N="162" REF="032200_0094_0FF18457F01F4278">
all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of &s;weet air; and tho&s;e that remained were &s;ickly enough, God knows. When we came a-&s;hore, we were &s;old to the planters, and I was bound for &s;even years more. As I was no &s;cholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the ne|groes; and I &s;erved out my time, as in duty bound to do.</P>
<P>"When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;&s;age home; and glad I was to &s;ee <HI>Old England</HI> again, becau&s;e I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vaga|bond once more, &s;o did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs, when I could get them.</P>
<P>"I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then de&s;ired me to &s;tand. They belonged to the pre&s;s-gang. I was carried before the ju&s;tice, and, as I could give no account of my&s;elf, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;oldier. I cho&s;e the latter; and, in this po&s;t of gentleman, I &s;erved two campaigns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was at the battles of <HI>Val</HI> and <HI>Fontenoy,</HI> and received but one wound, through the brea&s;t here; but the doctor of our regiment &s;oon made me well again.</P>

"When the peace came on, I was di&s;charg|ed; and, as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;omtimes trouble&s;ome, I li&s;ted for a land&s;man in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> company's &s;ervice. I have fought the <HI>French</HI> in &s;ix pitched battles; and I verily believe, that if I could read or write, our Captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and &s;o got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocked. This was at the beginning of the pre|&s;ent war, and I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending my money; but the government wanted men, and &s;o I was pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;ailor before ever I could &s;et foot on &s;hore.</P>

<P>"Our crew was carried into <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in jail; but for my part, it was nothing to

me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned. One night, as I was a&s;leep on my bed of boards, with a warm blan|ket about me, (for I always loved to lie well) I was awakened by the boat&s;wain, who had a dark lantern in his hand. <Q><HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays he to me, will you knock out the <HI>French</HI> centry's brains?</Q> "I don't care," &s;ays I, &s;triving to keep my&s;elf awake "if I lend a hand." <Q>Then follow me, &s;ays he, and I hope we &s;hall do bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q> So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the clothes I had, about my middle, and went with him to &s;ight the <HI>Frenchman.</HI> I hate the <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e they are all &s;laves, and wear wooden &s;hoes.</P>
<P>"Though we had no arms, one <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> is able to beat five <HI>French</HI> at any time; &s;o we went down to the door, where both the centries were po&s;ted, and, ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down.

<P>"I was once more in the power of the <HI>French,</HI> and, I believe, it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to <HI>Bre&s;t;</HI> but, by good fortune, we were retaken by the Viper.

If I had had the good fortune to have lo&s;t my leg and u&s;e of my hand on board a king's &s;hip, and not a board a privateer, I &s;hould have been entitled to clothing and maintenance during the re&s;t of my life, but that was not my chance: one man is born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle.

In <HI>China,</HI> if two porters &s;hould meet in a narrow &s;treet, they would lay down their burthens, make a thou&s;and excu&s;es to each other for the accidental interruption, and beg pardon on their knees.

<P>IT were highly to be wi&s;hed, that legi&s;lative power would direct the law rather to reforma|tion than &s;everity; that it would appear convin|ced, that the work of eradicating crimes, is not by making puni&s;hments familiar, but formidable. In&s;tead of our pre&s;ent pri&s;ons, which find or make men guilty, which inclo&s;e wretches for the com|mi&s;&s;ion of one crime, and return them, if return|ed alive, fitted for the perpetration of thou&s;ands, it were to be wi&s;hed we had, as in other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> places of penitence and &s;olitude, where the accu&s;ed might be attended by &s;uch as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives of virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increa&s;|ing puni&s;hments, is the way to mend a &s;tate: nor can I avoid even que&s;tioning the validity of that right, which &s;ocial combinations have a&s;&s;um|ed,
<PB N="179" REF="032200_0102_0FF18470EBAEF3F0">
of capitally puni&s;hing offences of a &s;light nature. In ca&s;es of murder, their right is ob|vious; as it is the duty of us all, from the law of &s;elf-defence, to cut off that man who has &s;hewn a di&s;regard for the life of another. A|gain&s;t &s;uch, all nature ri&s;es in arms; but it is not &s;o again&s;t him who &s;teals my property. Na|tural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the hor&s;e he &s;teals is as much his pro|perty as mine. If then, I have any right, it mu&s;t be from a compact made between us, that he who deprives the other of his hor&s;e &s;hall die.

When by indi&s;criminate penal laws a nation beholds the &s;ame puni&s;hment affix|ed to di&s;&s;imilar degrees of guilt, from perceiv|ing no di&s;tinction in the penalty, the people are led to lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of di&s;tinction in the crime, and this di&s;tinction is the bulwark of all morali|ty: thus the multitude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call for fre&s;h re&s;traints.</P>

of drawing hard the cords of &s;ociety till a con|vultion come to bur&s;t them, in&s;tead of cutting away wretches as u&s;ele&s;s, before we have tried their utility, in&s;tead of converting correction in|to vengence, it were to be wi&s;hed, that we tried the re&s;trictive arts of government, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant of the peo|ple.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>DEATH is not that terrible thing which we &s;uppo&s;e it to be; it is a &s;pectre which frights us at; di&s;tance, but which di&s;appears when we come to approach it more clo&s;ely. Our ideas of its terrors are conceived in prejudice, and dre&s;&s;ed up by fancy; we regard it not only as the great|e&s;t misfortune, but al&s;o as an evil accompanied
<PB N="182" REF="032200_0104_0FF1847564C1BAA0">
with the mo&s;t excruciating tortures: we have even increa&s;ed our apprehen&s;ions, by rea&s;oning on the extent of our &s;ufferings. It mu&s;t be dreadful, &s;ay &s;ome, &s;ince it is &s;ufficient to &s;e|parate the &s;oul from the body; it mu&s;t be long, &s;ince our &s;ufferings are proportioned to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of our ideas; and the&s;e being painful, mu&s;t &s;ucceed each other with extreme rapidi|ty. In this manner has fal&s;e philo&s;ophy labour|ed to augment the mi&s;eries of our nature, and to aggravate that period which nature has kindly covered with in&s;en&s;ibility. Neither the mind, nor the body, can &s;uffer the&s;e calamities; the mind is, at that time, mo&s;tly without ideas; and the body too much enfeebled to be capable of perceiving its pain. A very acute pain produces either death, or fainting, which is a &s;tate &s;imilar to death: the body can luffer but to a certain degree; if the torture becomes exce&s;&s;ive, it de|&s;troys it&s;elf; and the mind cea&s;es to perceive, when the body can no longer endure.</P>
<P>In this manner exce&s;&s;ive pain admits of no reflection; and, wherever there are are any &s;igns of it, we may &s;ure that the &s;ufferings of the pa|tient are no greater than what we our&s;elves may have remembered to endure.</P>
<P>But, in the article of death, we have many in|&s;tances in which the dying per&s;on has &s;hewn that very reflection which pre-&s;uppo&s;es an ab&s;ence of the greate&s;t pain; and, con&s;equently, that
<PB N="183" REF="032200_0104_0FF1847564C1BAA0">
pang which ends life cannot even be &s;o great as tho&s;e which have preceded. Thus, when <HI>Charles</HI> XII. was &s;hot at the &s;iege of <HI>Frederick &s;hall,</HI> he was &s;een to clap his hand on the hilt of his &s;word; and although the blow was great enough to terminate one of the bolde&s;t and brave&s;t lives in the world, yet it was not painful enough to de&s;troy reflection. He perceived him&s;elf attack|ed; he reflected that he ought to defend him&s;elf, and his body obeyed the impul&s;e of his mind, even in the la&s;t extremity. Thus it is the pre|judice of per&s;ons in health, and not the body in pain, that makes us &s;uffer from the approach of death: we have, all our lives, contracted an habit of making our exce&s;&s;ive plea&s;ures and pains; and nothing but repeated experience &s;hews us how &s;eldom the one can be &s;uffered, or the other enjoyed, to the utmo&s;t. If there be any thing nece&s;&s;ary to confirm what we have &s;aid concern|ing the gradual ce&s;&s;ation of life, or the in&s;en&s;ible approaches of our end, nothing can more effc|tually prove it than the uncertainty of the &s;igns of death. If we con&s;ult what <HI>Win&s;low</HI> or <HI>Bru|hier</HI> have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, we &s;hall be con|vinced, that between life and death, the &s;hade is &s;o very undi&s;tingui&s;hable, that even all the pow|ers of art can &s;carcely determine where the one ends, and the other begins. The colour of the vi&s;age, the warmth of the body, the &s;upplene&s;s of the joints, are but uncertain &s;igns of life &s;till
<PB N="184" REF="032200_0105_0FF18479C492DA48">
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting; while, on the contrary, the palene&s;s of the complexion, the coldne&s;s of the body, the &s;tiffne&s;s of the extremities, the ce&s;&s;ation of all motion, and the total in&s;en&s;ibility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death begun. In the &s;ame manner, al&s;o, with regard to the pul&s;e, and the breathing, the&s;e motions are often &s;o kept under, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to perceive them. By approaching a lookinggla&s;s to the mouth of the per&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead, peo|ple often expect to find whether he breathes or not; but this is a very uncertain experiment: the gla&s;s is frequently &s;ullied by the vapour of the dead man's body; and often the per&s;on is &s;till alive, although the gla&s;s is no way tarni&s;h|ed. In the &s;ame manner, neither burning, nor &s;carifying; neither noi&s;es in the ears, nor pun|gent &s;pirits applied to the no&s;trils, give certain &s;igns of the di&s;continuance of life; and there are many in&s;tances of per&s;ons who have endured them all, and afterwards recovered, without any external a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;pectators. How careful, therefore, &s;hould we be, before we commit tho&s;e who are deare&s;t to us to the grave, to be well a&s;&s;ured of their de|parture!&mdash;Experience, ju&s;tice, humanity, all per|&s;uade us not to ha&s;ten the funerals of our friends, but to keep their bodies unburied, until we have certain &s;igns of their real decea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE STROLING PLAYER.</HEAD>
<P>I AM fond of amu&s;ement, in whatever com|pany it is to be found; and wit, though dre&s;&s;ed in rags, is ever plea&s;ing to me. I went &s;ome days ago to take a walk in <HI>St. James' Park,</HI> about the hour in which company leave it to go to dinner. There were but few in the walks, and tho&s;e who &s;taid, &s;eemed, by their looks, rather more willing to forget that they had an appetite than gain one. I &s;at down on one of the benches, at the other end of which was &s;eat|ed a man in very &s;habby cloaths.</P>
<P>We continued to groan, to hem, and to cough, as u&s;ual upon &s;uch occa&s;ions; and, at la&s;t, ven|tured upon conver&s;ation. "I beg pardon, Sir," cried I, "but I think I have &s;een you before; your face is familiar to me." "Yes, Sir," re|plied he, "I have a good familiar face, as my friends tell me. I am as well known in every town in <HI>England</HI> as the dromedary, or live cro|codile.
<PB N="187" REF="032200_0106_0FF1847CC0CF7178">
You mu&s;t under&s;tand, Sir, that I have been the&s;e &s;ixteen years <HI>Merry Andrew</HI> to a pup|pet&s;how; la&s;t <HI>Bartholomew</HI> fair my ma&s;ter and I quarrelled, beat each other, and parted; he to fell his puppets to the pincu&s;hion-makers in <HI>Ro&s;emary-lane,</HI> and I to &s;tarve in <HI>St. James' Park.</HI>"</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry, Sir, that a per&s;on of your ap|pearance &s;hould labour under any difficulties." "O, Sir," returned he, "my appearance is very much at your &s;ervice; but though I cannot boa&s;t of eating much, yet there are few that are merrier: if I had twenty thou&s;and a year, I &s;hould be very merry; and, thank the Fates, though not worth a groat, I am very merry &s;till. If I have three pence in my pocked, I never refu&s;e to be my three halfpence; and, if I have no money, I never &s;corn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay for my reckoning. What think you, Sir, of a &s;teak and a tankard? You &s;hall treat me now, and I will treat you again when I find you in the <HI>Park</HI> in love with eating, and without money to pay for a dinner."</P>
<P>As I never refu&s;ed a &s;mall expence for the &s;ake of a merry companion, we in&s;tantly adjourn|ed to a neighbouring alehou&s;e; and, in a few moments, had a frothing tankard, and a &s;moak|ing &s;teak, &s;pread on the table before us. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s how much the &s;ight of &s;uch good cheer improved my companion's vivacity.
<PB N="188" REF="032200_0107_0FF1847F9914AF50">
"I like this dinner, Sir," &s;ays he, "for three rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, becau&s;e I am naturally fond of beef; &s;econdly, becau&s;e I am hungry; and, third|ly and la&s;tly, becau&s;e I get it for nothing: no meat eats &s;o &s;weet as that for which we do not pay."</P>
<P>He therefore now fell to, and his appetite &s;eemed to corre&s;pond with his inclination. Af|ter dinner was over, he ob&s;erved that the &s;teak was tough; "and yet, Sir," returns he, "bad as it was, it &s;eemed a rump-&s;teak to me. O the delights of poverty and a good appetite! We beggars are the very fondlings of Nature: the rich &s;he treats like an errant &s;tep-mother; they are plea&s;ed with nothing: cut a &s;teak from what part you will and it is in&s;upportably tough; dre&s;s it up with pickles,&mdash;even pickles cannot procure them an appetite. But the whole crea|tion is filled with good things for the beggar; <HI>Calvert'</HI>s butt out-ta&s;tes champaigne, and <HI>Sedge|ley'</HI>s home-brewed excels tokay. Joy, joy, my blood! though our e&s;tates lie no where, we have fortunes wherever we go. If an inunda|tion &s;weeps away half the grounds of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> I am content; I have no lands there: if the &s;tocks &s;ink, that gives me no unea&s;ine&s;s; I am no <HI>Jew.</HI>"</P>
<P>The fellow's vivacity, joined to his poverty, I own, rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity to know &s;omething of his life and circum&s;tances; and I intreated,
<PB N="189" REF="032200_0107_0FF1847F9914AF50">
that he would indulge my de&s;ire.&mdash;"That I will, Sir," &s;aid he, "and welcome; only let us drink to prevent our &s;leeping; let us have another tankard while we are awake; let us have another tankard; for, ah! how charming a tank|ard looks when full!</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know, then, that I am very well de&s;cended: my ance&s;tors have made &s;ome noi&s;e in the world; for my mother cried oy&s;ters, and my father beat a drum: I am told we have even had &s;ome trumpeters in our family. Many a nobleman cannot &s;hew &s;o re&s;pectful a genealogy: but that is neither here nor there. As I was their only child, my father de&s;igned to breed me up to his own employment, which was that of drummer to a puppet-&s;hew. Thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to <HI>Punch</HI> and King <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his glory. But, though my father was very fond of in&s;tructing me in beating all the marches and points of war, I made no very great progre&s;s, becau&s;e I naturally had no ear for mu&s;ic; &s;o, at the age of fifteen, I went and li&s;ted for a &s;oldier. As I had ever hated beating a drum, &s;o I &s;oon found that I di&s;liked carrying a mu&s;ket al&s;o; neither the one trade nor the other were to my ta&s;te, for I was by nature fond of being a gentle|man: be&s;ides, I was obliged to obey my captain; he has his will, I have mine, and you have yours: now I very rea&s;onably concluded, that
<PB N="190" REF="032200_0108_0FF184814A0EF768">
it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's.</P>
<P>"The life of a &s;oldier &s;oon therefore gave me the &s;pleen: I a&s;ked leave to quit the &s;ervice; but, as I was tall and &s;trong, my captain thank|ed me for my kind intention, and &s;aid, becau&s;e he had a regard for me, we &s;hould not part. I wrote to my father a very di&s;mal penitent letter, and de&s;ired that he would rai&s;e money to pay for my di&s;charge; but the good man was as fond of drinking as I was (Sir, my &s;ervice to you), and tho&s;e who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's di&s;charges: in &s;hort, he never an&s;wered my letter. What could be done? If I have not money, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, to pay for my di&s;charge, I mu&s;t find an equivalent &s;ome other way; and that mu&s;t be by running away. I de&s;erted, and that an&s;wered my purpo&s;e every bit as well as if I had bought my di&s;charge.</P>
<P>"Well, I was now fairly rid of my military employment: I &s;old my &s;oldier's clothes, bought wor&s;e, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the mo&s;t unfrequented roads po&s;&s;ible. One even|ing, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I afterwards found to be the curate of the pari&s;h, thrown from his hor&s;e in a miry road, and almo&s;t &s;mothered in the mud. He de&s;ired my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I gave it, and drew him out with &s;ome difficulty. He thanked me for my trouble, and was going off, but I followed
<PB N="191" REF="032200_0108_0FF184814A0EF768">
him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door. The curate a&s;ked an hundred que&s;tions; as, who&s;e &s;on I was; from whence I came; and whether I would be faithful? I an&s;wered him greatly to his &s;atisfac|tion; and gave my&s;elf one of the be&s;t characters in the world for &s;obriety (Sir, I have the honour of drinking your health), di&s;cretion, and fide|lity. To make a long &s;tory &s;hort, he wanted a &s;ervant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months; we did not much like each other: I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat; I loved a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-&s;ervant, was ill-natured and ugly. As they endeavoured to &s;tarve me between them, I made a pious re&s;olution to prevent their commit|ting murder: I &s;tole the eggs as &s;oon as they were laid; I emptied every unfini&s;hed bottle that I could lay my hands on; whatever eatable came in my way was &s;ure to di&s;appear: in &s;hort, they found I would not do; &s;o I was di&s;charged one morning, and paid three &s;hillings and &s;ix|pence for two months wages.</P>
<P>"While my money was getting ready, I em|ployed my&s;elf in making preparations for my departure: two hens were hatching in an out|hou&s;e; I went and habitually took the eggs, and, not to &s;eparate the parents from the children, I lodged hens and all in my knap&s;ack. After this piece of frugality, I returned to receive my mo|ney;
<PB N="192" REF="032200_0109_0FF184844ECB2BA0">
and, with my knap&s;ack on my back, and a &s;taff in my hand, I bid adieu, with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the hou&s;e, when I heard behind me the cry of Stop thief! but this only increa&s;ed my di&s;patch; it would have been fooli&s;h to &s;top, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me. But hold&mdash;I think I pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e two months at the curate's without drinking. Come, the times are dry; and may this be my poi&s;on, if ever I &s;pent two more pious, &s;tupid months in all my life!</P>
<P>"Well, after travelling &s;ome days, whom &s;hould I light upon but a company of &s;trolling players? The moment I &s;aw them at a di&s;tance, my heart warmed to them; I had a &s;ort of na|tural love for every thing of the vagabond order; they were employed in &s;ettling their baggage, which had been overturned in a narrow way. I offered my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they excepted; and we &s;oon became &s;o well acquainted, that they took me as a &s;ervant. This was a para|di&s;e to me; they &s;ung, danced, drank, eat, and travelled, all at the &s;ame time. By the blood of the <HI>Mirabels,</HI> I thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laugh|ed at every word that was &s;poken. They liked me as much as I liked them; I was a very good figure as you &s;ee; and, though I was poor, I was not mode&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="032200_0109_0FF184844ECB2BA0">
"I love a &s;traggling life above all things in the world; &s;ometimes good, &s;ometimes bad; to be warm to-day, and cold to-morrow; to eat when one can get it, and drink when (the tank|ard is out) it &s;tands before me. We arrived that evening at <HI>Tenderten,</HI> and took a large room at the <HI>Greyhound;</HI> where we re&s;olved to exhibit <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> with the funeral proce&s;&s;ion, the grave and the garden &s;cene. <HI>Romeo</HI> was to be performed by a gentleman from the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane; Juliet</HI> by a lady who never appeared on any &s;tage before; and I was to &s;nuff the candles: all excellent in our way. We had figures enough, but the difficulty was to dre&s;s them. The &s;ame coat that &s;erved <HI>Romeo</HI> turned with the blue lining outwards, &s;erved for his friend <HI>Mercutio:</HI> a large piece of crape &s;ufficed at once for <HI>Juliet'</HI>s petticoat and pall: a pe&s;tle and morter, from a neighbouring apothecary's an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es of a bell; and our land|lord's own family, wrapped in white &s;heets &s;erv|ed to &s;ill up the proce&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, there were but three figures among us that might be &s;aid to be dre&s;&s;ed with any propriety: I mean the nur&s;e, the &s;traved apothecary, and my&s;elf. Our perfor|mance gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction: the whole au|dience were enchanted with our powers; and <HI>Tenterden</HI> is a town of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>There is one rule by which a &s;trolling-player may be ever &s;ecure of &s;ucce&s;s; that is, in our the|atrical
<PB N="194" REF="032200_0110_0FF1848872282A08">
way of expre&s;&s;ing it, to make a great deal of the character. To &s;peak and act as in com|mon life, is not playing; nor is it what people come to &s;ee: natural &s;peaking, like &s;weet wine, runs glibly over the palate, and &s;carce leaves any ta&s;te behind it: but being high in a part re|&s;embles vinegar, which grates upon the ta&s;te, and one feels it while he is drinking. To plea&s;e the town or country, the way is, to cry, wring, cringe into attitudes, mark the empha&s;is, &s;lap the pockets, and labour like one in the falling &s;ickne&s;s; that is the way to work for applau&s;e, that is the way to gain it.</P>
<P>"As we received much reputation for our &s;kill on this fir&s;t exhibition, it was but natural for me to a&s;cribe part of the &s;ucce&s;s to my&s;elf. I &s;nuffed the candles, and, let me tell you, that, without a candle-&s;nuffer, the piece would lo&s;e half its embelli&s;hments. In this manner we con|tinued a fortnight, and drew tolerable hou&s;es; but the evening before our intended departure, we gave out our very be&s;t piece, in which all our &s;trength was to be exerted. We had great ex|pectations from this, and even doubled our pri|ces; when, behold, one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever. This was a &s;troke like thunder to our little company: they were re&s;olv|ed to go, in a body, to &s;cold the man for fall|ing &s;ick at &s;o inconvenient a time, and that, too, of a di&s;order that threatened to be expen&s;ive: I

&s;eized the moment, and offered to act the part my&s;elf in his &s;tead.

<P>"I found my memory exce&s;&s;ively helped by drinking; I learned my part with a&s;toni&s;hing ra|pidity, and bid adieu to &s;nuffing candles ever after. I found that nature had de&s;igned me for more noble employments, and I was re&s;olved to take her when in the humour. We got together in order to rehear&s;e, and I informed my compa|nions, ma&s;ters now no longer, of the &s;urpri&s;ing change I felt within me. Let the &s;ick man, &s;aid I, be under no unea&s;ine&s;s to get well again; I'll fill his place to univer&s;al &s;atisfaction; he may even die if he thinks proper; I'll engage that he &s;hall never be mi&s;&s;ed.

my name in the bills, with the utmo&s;t good-na|ture; and, as affairs &s;tand, cannot act without me; &s;o, gentlemen, to &s;hew you my gratitude, I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you, otherwi&s;e I declare off; I'll brandi&s;h my &s;nuffers, and clip candles as u&s;ual. This was a very di&s;agreeable proppo&s;al; but they found that it was impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e it; it was irre&s;i&s;tible, it was adamant: they con&s;ented, and I went on in king <HI>Bajazet.</HI> My frowning brows, bound with a &s;tocking &s;tuffed into a turban, while on my captiv'd arms I brandi&s;hed a jack-chain. Nature &s;eemed to have fitted me for the part; I was tall, and had a loud voice; my ve|ry entrance excited univer&s;al applau&s;e; I looked round on the audience with a &s;mile, and made a mo&s;t low and graceful bow, for that is the rule among us. As it was a very pa&s;&s;ionate part, I invigorated my &s;pirits with three full gla&s;&s;es (the tankard is almo&s;t out) of brandy. By <HI>Alla!</HI> it is almo&s;t inconceivable how I went through it; <HI>Tamerlane</HI> was but a fool to me; though he was &s;ometimes loud enough too, yet I was &s;till louder than he: but then, be&s;ides, I had attitudes in abundance: in general I kept my arms folded up thus, upon the pit of my &s;tomach; it is the way at <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> and has always a fine effect. The tankard would &s;ink to the bottom before I could get through the whole of my merits: in &s;hort, I came off like

a prodigy; and &s;uch was my &s;ucce&s;s, that I could ravi&s;h the laurels even from a &s;urloin of beef. The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me after the play was over, to compliment me upon my &s;ucce&s;s; one prai&s;|ed my voice, another my per&s;on: Upon my word, &s;ays the '&s;quire's lady, he will make one of the fine&s;t actors in <HI>Europe;</HI> I &s;ay it, and I think I am &s;omething of a judge.&mdash;Prai&s;e in the beginning is agreeable enough, and we re|ceive it as a favour; but, when it comes in great quantities, we regard it only as a debt, which nothing but our merit could extort: in|&s;tead of thanking them, I internally applauded my&s;elf. We were de&s;ired to give our piece a &s;econd time; we obeyed, and I was applauded even more than before.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t we left the town, in order to be at a hor&s;e-race at &s;ome di&s;tance from thence. I &s;hall never think of <HI>Tenterden</HI> without tears of gratitude and re&s;pect. The ladies and gentlemen there, take my word for it, are very good judges of plays and actors. Come, let us drink their healths, if you plea&s;e, Sir.

<P>"The races were ended before we arrived at the next town, which was no &s;mall di&s;appoint|ment to our company; however, we were re|&s;olved to take all we could get.

I &s;incerely believe I &s;hould have been the fir&s;t actor of <HI>Europe,</HI> had my growing merit been properly cultivated; but there came an unkindly fro&s;t which nipped me in the bud, and levelled me once more down to the common &s;tandard of humanity I played Sir <HI>Harry Wildair;</HI> all the country ladies were charmed: if I but drew out my &s;nuff-box, the whole hou&s;e was in a roar of rapture; when I exerci&s;ed my cudgel, I thought they would have fallen into convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>There was here a lady who had received an education of nine months in <HI>London;</HI> and this gave her preten&s;ions to ta&s;te, which rendered her the indi&s;putable mi&s;tre&s;s of the ceremonies wherever &s;he came.

<HEAD>ASEM, THE MAN-HATER.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE <HI>Tauris</HI> lifts its head above the &s;torm and pre&s;ents nothing to the &s;ight of the di&s;tant traveller, but a pro&s;pect of nodding rocks, falling torrents, and all the variety of tremendous na|ture; on the bleak bo&s;om of this frightful moun|tain, &s;ecluded from &s;ociety, and dete&s;ting the ways of men, lived <HI>A&s;em</HI> the Man-hater.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;em</HI> had &s;pent his youth with men, had &s;har|ed in their amu&s;ements, and had been taught to love his fellow-creatures with the mo&s;t ardent affection: but, from the tenderne&s;s of his di&s;po|&s;ition, he exau&s;ted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The petitioner never &s;ued in vain; the weary traveller never pa&s;&s;|ed his door: he only de&s;i&s;ted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving.</P>
<P>From a fortune thus &s;pent in benevolence, he expected a grateful return from tho&s;e he had for|merely
<PB N="203" REF="032200_0114_0FF1849464CC9FB0">
relieved; and made his application with confidence of redre&s;s. The ungrateful world &s;oon grew weary of his importunity; for pity is but a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion. He &s;oon, therefore, began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them: he perceived a thou&s;and vices he had never be|fore &s;u&s;pected to exi&s;t: wherever he turned, ingratitude, di&s;&s;imulation, and treachery, contri|buted to increa&s;e his dete&s;tation of them. Re|&s;olved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated, and which repaid his dete&s;ta|tion with contempt, he retired to this region of &s;terility, in order to brood over his re&s;entment in &s;olitude, and conver&s;e with the only hone&s;t heart he knew; namely, his own.</P>
<P>A cave was his only &s;helter from the incle|mency of the weather; fruits gathered with difficulty from the mountain's &s;ide, his only food; and his drink was fetched with danger and toil from the headlong torrent. In this manner he lived, &s;eque&s;tered from &s;ociety, pa&s;&s;|ing the hours in meditation, and &s;ometimes ex|ulting that he was able to live independently of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>At the foot of the mountain, an exten&s;ive lake di&s;played its gla&s;&s;y bo&s;om; reflecting, on its broad &s;urface, the impending horrors of the mountain. To this capacious mirror he would &s;ometimes de&s;cend, and, reclining on its &s;teep

bank, ca&s;t an eager look on the &s;mooth expan&s;e that lay before him. "How beautiful," he often cried, "is nature! how lovely, even in her wild|e&s;t &s;cenes! How finely contra&s;ted is the level plain that lies beneath me, with yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> awful pile that hides its tremendous head in clouds! But the beauty of the&s;e &s;cenes is no way comparable with their utility; from hence an hundred rivers are &s;upplied, which di&s;tribute health and verdure to the various countries through which they flow. Every part of the univer&s;e is beautiful, ju&s;t, and wi&s;e, but man: vile man is a &s;oleci&s;m in nature; the only mon&s;ter in the creation. Tempe&s;ts and whirlwinds have their u&s;e; but vicious, ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of univer&s;al beauty. Why was I born of that dete&s;ted &s;pecies, who&s;e vices are almo&s;t a reproach to the wi&s;dom of the divine Creator! Were men intirely free from vice, all would be uniformity, harmony, and order. A world of moral rectitude &s;hould be the re&s;ult of a prefectly moral agent. Why, why then, O <HI>Alla!</HI> mu&s;t I be thus confined in darkne&s;s, doubt and de&s;pair?"</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he uttered the word De&s;pair, he was going to plunge into a lake beneath him, at once to &s;atisfy his doubts, and put a period to his anxiety; when he perceived a mo&s;t maje&s;tic being walking on the &s;urface of the water, and approaching the bank on which he &s;tood. So

<HEAD>THE STORY OF ALCANDER AND SEPTIMIUS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TAKEN FROM A BYZANTINE HISTORIAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ATHENS,</HI> long after the decline of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> empire, &s;till continued the &s;eat of learning, politene&s;s, and wi&s;dom. <HI>Theodoric,</HI> the <HI>O&s;trogoth.</HI> repaired the &s;chools which barbarity was &s;uffer|ing to fall into decay, and continued tho&s;e pen&s;ions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized.</P>
<P>In this city, and about this period, <HI>Alcander</HI> and <HI>Septimius</HI> were fellow &s;tudents together; the one, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle rea&s;oner of all the <HI>Lyceum;</HI> the other, the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration &s;oon begot a friend&s;hip. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they were natives of the two mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world; for <HI>Alcander</HI> was of <HI>Athens, Septimius</HI> came from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>In this &s;tate of harmony they lived for &s;ome time together, when <HI>Alcander,</HI> after pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t part of his youth in the indolence of philo|&s;ophy, thought at length of entering into the bu&s;y world; and, as a &s;tep previous to this, placed his affections on <HI>Hypatia,</HI> a lady of exqui|&s;ite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were per|formed;
<PB N="219" REF="032200_0122_0FF184AACCCF6758">
and nothing now remained, but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander'</HI>s exultation in his own happine&s;s, or being unable to enjoy any &s;atisfaction without making his friend <HI>Septimius</HI> a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce <HI>Hypatia</HI> to his fellow-&s;tu|dent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found him&s;elf equally happy in friend|&s;hip and love. But this was an interview fatal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the future peace of both; for <HI>Septimius</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but he was &s;mitten with an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion; and, though he u&s;ed every effort to &s;uppre&s;s de&s;ires at once &s;o imprudent and unju&s;t, the emotions of his mind in a &s;hort time became &s;o &s;trong, that they brought on a fever, which the phy&s;icians judged incu|rable.</P>
<P>During this illne&s;s, <HI>Alcander</HI> watched him with all the anxiety of fondne&s;s, and brought his mi&s;tre&s;s to join in tho&s;e amiable offices of friend&s;hip. The &s;agacity of the phy&s;icians, by the&s;e means, &s;oon di&s;covered that the cau&s;e of their patient's di&s;order was love; and <HI>Alcander,</HI> being appri&s;ed of their di&s;covery, at length ex|torted a confe&s;&s;ion from the reluctant dying lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to de&s;cribe the conflict between love and friend&s;hip in the brea&s;t of <HI>Alcander</HI> on this occo&s;ion; it is enough

to &s;ay, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> were at that time ar|rived at &s;uch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exce&s;s. In &s;hort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms to the young <HI>Roman.</HI> They were married privately by his connivance, and this unlooked-for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the con&s;titution of the now happy <HI>Septimius.</HI> In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and &s;et out with his fair partner for <HI>Rome.</HI> Here, by an exertion of tho&s;e talents which he was &s;o eminently po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, <HI>Septimius,</HI> in a few years, arrived at the highe&s;t dignities of the &s;tate, and was con|&s;tituted the city judge, or praetor.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Alcander</HI> not only felt the pain of being &s;eparated from his friend and his mi&s;tre&s;s, but a per&s;ecution was al&s;o commenced again&s;t him, by the relations of <HI>Hypatia,</HI> for hav|ing ba&s;ely given up his bride, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to with&s;tand the in|fluence of a powerful party. He was ca&s;t, and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to rai&s;e &s;o large a &s;um at the time appointed, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were confi&s;cated, he him&s;elf was &s;tripped of the habit of freedom, expo&s;ed as a &s;lave in the market-place, and &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>

A merehant of <HI>Thrace</HI> becoming his purcha|&s;er, <HI>Alcander,</HI> with &s;ome other companions of di&s;tre&s;s, was carried into that region of de&s;olation and &s;terility. His &s;tated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious ma&s;ter, and his &s;ucce&s;s in hunting was all that was allowed him to &s;upply his precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of &s;ea&s;on &s;erved but to aggravate his un&s;heltered di&s;tre&s;s. After &s;ome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of e&s;caping offered; he embraced it with ardour; &s;o that, travelling by night, and lodging in ca|verns by day, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, he at la&s;t arrived in <HI>Rome.</HI> The &s;ame day on which <HI>Alcander</HI> arrived, <HI>Septimius</HI> &s;at admini&s;tering ju&s;|tice in the forum, whether our wanderer came, expecting to be in&s;tantly known, and publicly acknowledged, by his former friend.

The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night coming on, he now found him&s;elf un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a place to lie in, and
<PB N="222" REF="032200_0124_0FF184B078F709D0">
yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated and in rags, as he was, none of the citizens would harbour &s;o much wretchedne&s;s; and &s;leep|ing in the &s;treets might be attended with inter|ruption or danger: in &s;hort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the u&s;ual retreat of guilt, poverty, and de&s;pair. In this man&s;ion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his mi&s;e|ries for a while in &s;leep; and found, on his flinty couch, more ea&s;e than beds of down can &s;upply to the guilty.</P>
<P>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but, happening to di&s;agree about the divi&s;ion of their plunder, one of them &s;tabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was found next morning, dead, at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enquiry, an alarm was &s;pread; the cave was examined; and <HI>Alcander</HI> being found, was immediately ap|prehended, and accu&s;ed of robbery and mur|der. The circum&s;tances again&s;t him were &s;trong, and the wretchedne&s;s of his appearance con|firmed &s;u&s;picion. Misfortune and he were now &s;o long acquainted, that he at la&s;t became re|gardle&s;s of life. He dete&s;ted a world where he had found only ingratitude, fal&s;ehood, and cru|elty; he was determined to make no defence;
<PB N="223" REF="032200_0124_0FF184B078F709D0">
and thus, lowering with re&s;olution, he was dragg|ed, bound with cords, before the tribunal of <HI>Sep|timius.</HI> As the proofs were po&s;itive again&s;t him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a mo&s;t cruel and ignomonious death, when the attention of the multitude was &s;oon divided by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended &s;elling his plun|der, and &s;truck with a panic, had confe&s;&s;ed his crime. He was brought bound to the &s;ame tribunal, and acquitted every other per&s;on of any partner&s;hip in his guilt. <HI>Alcander'</HI>s innocence therefore appeared, but the &s;ullen ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct remained a wonder to the &s;urround|ing multitude; but their a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;till further increa&s;ed, when they &s;aw their judge &s;tart from his tribunal to embrace the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal. <HI>Septimius</HI> recollected his friend and former benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy.

<HEAD>PLEASURES OF RURAL RETIRE|MENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious retire|ment in which I pa&s;&s;ed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling &s;ome pain in thinking that tho&s;e happy days are never to return. In that retreat, all nature &s;eemed capable of affording plea&s;ure: I then made no refinements on happine&s;s, but could be plea&s;ed with the mo&s;t aukward efforts of ru&s;tic mirth; thought cro&s;s-purpo&s;es the highe&s;t &s;tretch of hu|man wit, and que&s;tions and commands the mo&s;t rational way of &s;pending the evening. Happy could &s;o charming an illu&s;ion &s;till continue! I find that age and knowledge only contribute to &s;our our di&s;po&s;itions. My pre&s;ent enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely le&s;s plea&s;ing. The plea&s;ure the be&s;t actors gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a country wag who imitated a Quaker's &s;ermon. The mu&s;ic of the fine&s;t &s;inger is di&s;&s;onance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid &s;ung me into tears with <HI>Johnny Arm&s;trong'</HI>s La&s;t Good Night, or the cruelty of <HI>Barbara Allen.</HI></P>
<P>Writers of every age have endeavoured to &s;hew that plea&s;ure is in us, and not in the ob|jects offered for our amu&s;ement. If the &s;oul be happily di&s;po&s;ed, every thing becomes capable
<PB N="226" REF="032200_0126_0FF184B679D651F8">
of affording entertainment; and di&s;tre&s;s will almo&s;t want a name. Every occurrence pa&s;&s;es in review like the figures of a proce&s;&s;ion; &s;ome may be aukward, others ill-dre&s;&s;ed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the ma&s;ter of the ceremony.</P>
<P>I remember to have once &s;een a &s;lave in a fortification in <HI>Flanders,</HI> who appeared no way touched with his &s;ituation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night-fall; and con|demned to this for life: yet, with all the&s;e circum&s;tances of apparent wretchedne&s;s, he &s;ang, would have danced but that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merrie&s;t, happie&s;t man of all the garri&s;on. What a practical philo&s;opher was here! An happy con&s;titution &s;upplied philo&s;o|phy; and, though &s;eemingly de&s;titute of wi&s;dom, he was really wi&s;e. No reading or &s;tudy had contributed to di&s;enchant the fairy-land around him: every thing furni&s;hed him with an oppor|tunity of mirth; and, though &s;ome thought him, from his in&s;en&s;ibility, a fool, he was &s;uch an ideot as philo&s;ophers &s;hould wi&s;h to imitate; for all philo&s;ophy is only forcing the trade of happine&s;s, when nature &s;eems to have denied the means.</P>
<P>They who, like our &s;lave, can place them|&s;elves on that &s;ide of the world in which every thing appears in a plea&s;ing light, will find &s;ome|thing
<PB N="227" REF="032200_0126_0FF184B679D651F8">
in every occurrence to excite their good|humour. The mo&s;t calamitous events, either to them&s;elves or others, can bring no new afflic|tion; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the bu&s;tle of heroi&s;m, or the rants of ambition, &s;erve only to heighten the ab&s;urdity of the &s;cene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in &s;hort, as little angui&s;h at their own di&s;tre&s;s, or the complaints of others, as the undertaker though dre&s;&s;ed in black, feels &s;orrow at a fu|neral.</P>
<P>Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Cardinal <HI>de Retz</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this happine&s;s of tem|per in the highe&s;t degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and de&s;pi&s;ed all that wore the pe|dantic appearance of philo&s;ophy, wherever plea|&s;ure was to be &s;old, he was generally foremo&s;t to rai&s;e the auction. Being an univer&s;al admirer of the fair &s;ex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more favourable reception: if &s;he, too, rejected his addre&s;&s;es, he never thought of retiring into de&s;erts, or pining in hope|le&s;s di&s;tre&s;s: he per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that, in&s;tead of loving the lady, he only fancied that he had loved her; and &s;o all was well again. When fortune wore her angrie&s;t look, and he at la&s;t fell into the power of his mo&s;t deadly enemy, Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> (being confined a clo&s;e pri|&s;oner
<PB N="228" REF="032200_0127_0FF184B95676F618">
in the ca&s;tle of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI>) he never attempted to &s;upport his di&s;tre&s;s by wi&s;dom or philo&s;ophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at him&s;elf and his per&s;ecutor, and &s;eemed infinitely plea&s;ed at his new &s;ituation. In this man&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s, though &s;ecluded from his friends, though denied all the amu&s;ements and even the conveniences, of life, he &s;till retain|ed his good-humour; laughed at all the little &s;pite of his enemies; and carried the je&s;t &s;o far, as to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.</P>
<P>All that the wi&s;dom of the proud can teach, is to be &s;tubborn or &s;ullen under misfortunes. The Cardinal's example will in&s;truct us to be merry in circum&s;tances of the highe&s;t affliction. It matters not whether our good-humour be con&s;trued by others into in&s;en&s;ibility, or even ideoti&s;m; it is happine&s;s to our&s;elves, and none but a fool would mea&s;ure his &s;atisfaction by what the world thinks of it. For my own part, I never pa&s;s by one of our pri&s;ons for debt, that I no not envy that felicity which is &s;till going for|ward among tho&s;e people, who forget the cares of the world by being &s;hut out from its ambition.</P>
<P>The happie&s;t &s;illy fellow I ever knew, was of the number of tho&s;e good-natured creatures that are &s;aid to do no harm to any but them&s;elves. Whenever he fell into any mi&s;ery, he u&s;ually called it, Seeing Life. If his head was broke

by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a &s;harper, he comforted him&s;elf by imitating the <HI>Hibernian</HI> di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lect of the one, or the more fa&s;hionable cant of the other. Nothing came ami&s;s to him. His inattention to money matters had incen&s;ed his father to &s;uch a degree, that all the interce&s;&s;ion of friends in his favour was fruitle&s;s. The old gentleman was on his death-bed. The whole family, and <HI>Dick</HI> among the number, gathered around him. "I leave my &s;econd &s;on, <HI>Andrew,</HI>" &s;aid the expiring mi&s;er, "my whole e&s;tate, and de&s;ire him to be frugal." <HI>Andrew,</HI> in a &s;orrow|ful tone, as is u&s;ual on the&s;e occa&s;ions, prayed Heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it him&s;elf. "I recommend <HI>Simon,</HI> my third &s;on, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him, be&s;ide, four thou&s;and pounds." "Ah! father," cried <HI>Simon</HI> (in great affliction, to be &s;ure), "May Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your&s;elf." At la&s;t, turning to poor <HI>Dick,</HI> "As for you, you have always been a &s;ad dog; you'll never come to good; you'll never be rich; I'll leave you a &s;hilling to buy a halter." "Ah! father," cries <HI>Dick,</HI> without any emotion, "may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your|&s;elf!" This was all the trouble the lo&s;s of for|tune gave this thoughtle&s;s imprudent creature. However, the tenderne&s;s of an uncle recompen&s;|ed the neglect of a father; and my friend is
<PB N="230" REF="032200_0128_0FF184BC2FF2F6A0">

<P>Yes, let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public, which pronounces him a dunce; at a general who &s;miles at the reproach of the vul|gar, or the lady who keeps her good-humour in &s;pite of &s;candal; but &s;uch is the wi&s;e&s;t behaviour that any of us can po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume; it is certain|ly a better way to oppo&s;e calamity by di&s;&s;ipation, than to take up the arms of rea&s;on or re&s;olution to oppo&s;e it: by the fir&s;t method, we forget our mi&s;eries; by the la&s;t, we only conceal them from others: by &s;truggling with misfortunes, we are &s;ure to receive &s;ome wounds in the conflict; but a &s;ure method to come off victorious, is by running away.</P>

<HEAD>PICTURE OF A CRITIC.</HEAD>
<P>A CRITIC is often guided by the &s;ame mo|tives that direct his author. The author endea|vours to per&s;uade us, that he has written a good book: the critic is equally &s;olicitous to &s;hew that he could write a better, had he thought proper. A critic is a being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the vanity, but not the genius, of a &s;cholar; inca|pable, from his native weakne&s;s, of lifting him|&s;elf from the ground, he applies to contiguous merit for &s;upport, makes the &s;portive &s;allies of another's imagination his &s;erious employment, pretends to take our feelings under his care, teaches where to condemn, where to lay the empha&s;is of prai&s;e, and may with as much ju&s;|tice be called a man of ta&s;te, as the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> who mea&s;ures his wi&s;dom by the length of his nails.</P>
<P>If, then, a book, &s;pirited or humorous, hap|pens to appear in the republic of letters, &s;everal critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a &s;ingle line of it, for them&s;elves had read it; and they know what is mo&s;t proper to excite laughter.

Yet, from the vernal &s;oftne&s;s of the air, the verdure of the fields, the tran&s;parency of the &s;treams, and the beauty of the women, I know few countries more proper to invite to court&s;hip. Here Love might &s;port among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel amid&s;t gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it &s;eems he has for&s;aken the i&s;land; and when a couple are now to be married, mutual love, or an union of minds, is the la&s;t and mo&s;t trifling con&s;ideration. If their goods and chattels can be brought to unite, their &s;ympathetic &s;ouls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty. The gentleman's mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the lady's marriageable grove; the match is &s;truck up; and both parties are piou&s;ly in love&mdash;according to act of parliament.</P>
<P>Thus, they who have fortune, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at lea&s;t of &s;omething that is lovely; but I actually pity tho&s;e who have none. I am told there was a time, when ladies, with no other merit but youth, virtue, and beauty, had a chance for hu&s;|bands, at lea&s;t among our clergymen and officers. The blu&s;h and innocence of &s;ixteen was &s;aid to have a powerful influence over the&s;e two profe&s;|&s;ions. But of late, all the little traffic of blu&s;hing, ogling, dimpling, and &s;miling, has been forbid|den by an act in that ca&s;e wi&s;ely made and provi|ded. A lady's whole cargo of &s;miles, &s;ighs, and whi&s;pers, is declared utterly contraband, till &s;he
<PB N="239" REF="032200_0132_0FF184C96A3BE7A8">
arrives in the warm latitude twenty-two, where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then permitted to dimple and &s;mile, when the dimples begin to for&s;ake her; and, when perhaps grown ugly, is charitably intru&s;ted with an unlimited u&s;e of her charms. Her lov|ers, however, by this time, have for&s;aken her; the captain has changed for another mi&s;tre&s;s; the prie&s;t him&s;elf leaves her in &s;olitude, to bewail her virginity, and &s;he dies even without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>Thus you find the <HI>Europeans</HI> di&s;couraging love with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as the rude&s;t &s;avage of <HI>Sofala.</HI> The Genius is &s;urely now no more.

He is no where to be found; and all that the ladies of each country can produce, are but a few trifling reliques, as in&s;tances of his former re&s;idence and favour.</P>

<P>"And, fir&s;t, the beauties of <HI>China</HI> appeared.

They indulged no airs that might expre&s;s loo&s;e de&s;ires, and they &s;eemed to &s;tudy only the graces of inanimate beauty.

view; which, after &s;ome time, &s;eemed rather to &s;atiate than inflame de&s;ire.

&s;erved to &s;hew, that beauty could be perfect, even with the &s;eeming di&s;advantage of a brown complexion. But their &s;avage education ren|dered them utterly unqualified to make the proper u&s;e of their power, and they were reject|ed as being incapable of uniting mental with &s;en&s;ual &s;atisfaction.

<P>"The beauties of <HI>Europe</HI> at la&s;t appeared; grace in their &s;teps, and &s;en&s;ibility &s;miling in every eye. It was the univer&s;al opinion, while they were approaching, that they would prevail; and the Genius &s;eemed to lend them his mo&s;t favourite attention. They opened their preten|&s;ions with the utmo&s;t mode&s;ty; but unfortu|nately, as their orator proceeded, &s;he happened to let fall the words, 'Hou&s;e in Town, Settle|ment, and Pin-money.'

<HEAD>COUNTENANCE TO THE VULGAR.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER may become of the higher orders of mankind, who are generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of collateral motives to virtue, the vulgar &s;hould be particularly regarded, who&s;e behaviour in civil life is totally hinged upon their hopes and fears.

Tho&s;e who con&s;titute the ba&s;is of the great fabric of &s;ociety, &s;hould be particularly regarded; for, in policy as in architecture, ruin is mo&s;t fatal when it begins from the bottom.</P>

<HEAD>OPINION OF THE GENIUS OF VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<P>BETWEEN <HI>Voltaire</HI> and the di&s;ciples of <HI>Confucius</HI> there are many differences; however, being of a different opinion does not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;h my e&s;teem. I am not di&s;plea&s;ed with my brother, becau&s;e he happens to a&s;k our father for favours in a different manner from me. Let his errors re&s;t in peace; his excellencies de&s;erve admiration: let me, with the wi&s;e, admire his wi&s;dom; let the envious and the ignorant ridicule his foibles; the folly of others is ever mo&s;t ridicu|lous to tho&s;e who are them&s;elves mo&s;t fooli&s;h.</P>
