And with the divine leave and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e to you on tho&s;e words of holy writ, which you may find in the XLV Chapter of EZEKIEL, part of the 8th, together with the 9th ver&s;e.</P>
<Q><P>&mdash;<HI>And my princes &s;hall no more oppre&s;s my people. And the re&s;t of the land &s;hall they give to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, accord|ing to their tribes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, let it &s;uffice you O princes of I&s;rael: remove violence and &s;poil, and execute judgment and ju&s;tice; take away your exactions from my people, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI></P></Q>
<P>'TIS happy, that we have in the holy &s;criptures divine directions to regulate the conduct of <HI>all ranks:</HI> nothing le&s;s than the <HI>au|thority of God</HI> can do this, to any purpo&s;e.</P>

But, when God &s;peaks, before whom <HI>prince</HI> and <HI>pea&s;ant</HI> &s;tand upon a parr, me|thinks, all, from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t, mu&s;t li&s;ten with a &s;acred veneration!</P>
<P>Indeed, as God does not now direct his voice <HI>immediately to us,</HI> we mu&s;t not coun|terfeit it, and &s;ay&mdash;<HI>the Lord &s;aith</HI>&mdash;when the Lord hath not &s;poken. But yet, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, we may, by analogy, take the ancient voice of God, as directed to us. This is the u&s;e we are to make of a great part of the old te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Let us keep this in mind and, I tru&s;t, we &s;hall find that we are not unconcerned in the words now read to you.</P>
<P>They were &s;poken at a time when there was a general corruption of manners; <HI>princes</HI> and <HI>people</HI> con&s;piring to provoke God to anger, and to bring down his judgments.</P>
<P>And, if we look over the prophets, we &s;hall find that the <HI>rulers</HI> were peculiarly guilty: the <HI>princes</HI> were become <HI>mighty oppre&s;&s;ors:</HI> and, when foreign enemies attacked them, <HI>unnaturally</HI> joined, and con|&s;pired

their ruin! This was a crime of the highe&s;t nature! For, nothing can be more aggravated than for the <HI>&s;hepherds</HI> to <HI>mi&s;|lead</HI> and <HI>butcher</HI> the flock they were &s;et to <HI>defend</HI> and <HI>feed!</HI> And the <HI>guardians</HI> of the public <HI>intere&s;ts,</HI> to turn <HI>traitors</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins</HI> to them that rai&s;ed them to their high pla|ces.!</P>
<P>To the <HI>princes</HI> and <HI>rulers,</HI> therefore, who were too big to hear any other, the <HI>God of Heaven</HI> &s;peaks in my <HI>text,</HI> and &s;ome preceeding and following ver&s;es.</P>
<P>Ordering, that the rulers &s;hould have a rea&s;onable portion laid out round their cities, by the &s;ide of the portion of the <HI>prie&s;ts,</HI> which was laid out <HI>by mea&s;ure.</HI> And then that the re&s;t of the land, as in the text, &s;hould be divided among the peo|ple as their inheritance.</P>
<P>And then, &s;ays God&mdash;<HI>my princes &s;hall no more oppre&s;s.</HI> That is&mdash;Thus <HI>prince</HI> and <HI>people</HI> &s;hall know their own, and enjoy their own: And the princes &s;hall make no more encroachments upon the <HI>people'</HI>s <HI>rights</HI> or <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions;</HI> which are as &s;acred as theirs.</P>

<HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, Let it &s;uffice you O princes of I&s;rael: remove violence and &s;poil, and execute judgment and ju&s;tice, take away your exactions from my people, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI></P>
<P>As if he had &s;aid&mdash;Who is he that will not hear, when the Lord of heaven &s;peaks? It concerns all the <HI>princes</HI> and <HI>ru|lers</HI> of the world to li&s;ten, for <HI>God, God,</HI> I &s;ay, &s;peaks! It is <HI>enough</HI> O <HI>princes</HI> and <HI>ru|lers</HI> and more than enough, that ye have done already, in <HI>oppre&s;&s;ing</HI> and <HI>abu&s;ing</HI> tho&s;e whom you were bound by every tie to <HI>pro|tect</HI> and <HI>make happy! Cea&s;e</HI> your <HI>violence</HI> then, make no more <HI>&s;poil</HI> upon my people! But let <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> be impartially executed, that all may have the benefit of it: and put an end to your extravagant <HI>ex|actions:</HI> and henceforth, let taxes and tri|bute be requir'd only in proportion to the nece&s;&s;ity of the public affairs, and not to <HI>&s;upport your own luxury</HI> or <HI>defend your un|righteous claims!</HI></P>
<P>Now, from this, <HI>rulers</HI> may learn &s;ome|thing what is the <HI>will of God</HI> concerning them; and the <HI>people</HI> &s;omewhat of their <HI>duty</HI> to them. And all may be led to

<HI>mourn</HI> over the <HI>mighty oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> of the earth, and to pray and hope for deliverance in God's time.</P>
<P>Let me therefore beg the attention of this honourable audience, while, in the fear of God, and with a due re&s;pect to my nu|merous &s;uperiours, I di&s;cour&s;e in the fol|lowing manner.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t. Con&s;ider, very briefly the duty of princes and rulers to the people.</HI></P>
<P>2dly. <HI>The duty of people to their rulers.</HI></P>
<P>3dly. <HI>Take a brief view of the oppre&s;&s;ions of the rulers of the world.</HI></P>
<P>4thly. <HI>Enquire, how it comes to pa&s;s that &s;uch multitudes of mankind &s;uffer them&s;elves to be thus grievou&s;ly oppre&s;s'd, by a few of their fellow men.</HI></P>
<P>5thly. <HI>Con&s;ider, how contrary this is to the will of God.</HI></P>
<P>6thly. <HI>Ju&s;t hint to the people at &s;ome things, which &s;eem to me mo&s;t likely to guard again&s;t tyranny in their rulers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="015703_0010_0F99E06D743F4A38">
<HI>And finally, con&s;ider, a moment, the hap|pine&s;s of mankind when oppre&s;&s;ors &s;hall cea&s;e, and they who rule over men &s;hall be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Then, <HI>I &s;hall very briefly con&s;ider the duty of princes and rulers to the people.</HI></P>
<P>Now as to old-fa&s;hion'd rulers hack|ney'd to the ways of the world, the voice from heaven cries to them to <HI>oppre&s;s no more.</HI> It cries mo&s;t &s;olemnly in my text. But as &s;uch rulers hear neither <HI>God</HI> nor <HI>man,</HI> we have no immediate bu&s;ine&s;s with them! And God grant we never may.</P>
<P>'Tis other kind of magi&s;trates with whom we have to do; <HI>cho&s;en by the people</HI> (as all lawful magi&s;trates are) to defend them a|gain&s;t tho&s;e ravening wolves, which have been devouring them.</P>
<P>And, their duty is to exert them&s;elves in <HI>watching</HI> over and <HI>defending</HI> them, with unwearied diligence; le&s;t they give the peo|ple room to &s;ay, that <HI>power</HI> is to be tru&s;ted with no body, and &s;o are put out of con|ceit of all government, and run into anar|chy and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="015703_0011_0F99E06EA6A20F78">
In the fir&s;t place, (where the con&s;titution is di&s;&s;olv'd) their duty is (with the a&s;&s;ent of the people) to frame the mo&s;t <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>equi|table con&s;titution;</HI> calculated, in the be&s;t manner which human wi&s;dom can devi&s;e, to an&s;wer the great and only de&s;ign of go|vernment, <HI>the &s;ecurity</HI> of the <HI>lives, liberty</HI> and <HI>property</HI> of the people.</P>
<P>For, though, where the <HI>magi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>people</HI> are generally <HI>virtuous,</HI> the people may be tolerably happy under almo&s;t any con&s;titution, or indeed without any. Yet, as the world is, a <HI>good con&s;titution</HI> is by no means to be di&s;regarded; but is the fir&s;t foundation to be laid for the happine&s;s of the people; and of great importance.</P>
<P N="2">2. The making and e&s;tabli&s;hing of <HI>good laws,</HI> is another important duty of theirs.</P>
<P>And it is a rare happine&s;s indeed when they have it in their power to begin all a|new, and <HI>revi&s;e</HI> and <HI>correct</HI> the whole <HI>code,</HI> and fix every thing on the &s;table ba&s;is of perfect equity.</P>
<P>And, here&mdash;Let no man make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which in the exerci&s;e of virtue, he would not willingly &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="13" REF="015703_0012_0F99E06F56F54DD8">
3. <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> men mu&s;t in the next place be appointed to every impor|tant office, that the laws may be faithfully and impartially <HI>executed.</HI></P>
<P>Without this, all the laws in the world will an&s;wer no good end: but <HI>government</HI> will be de&s;pis'd, and <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>di&s;order</HI> reign and rage. Under the be&s;t con&s;titution, <HI>the wicked will walk on every &s;ide, when the vile&s;t men are exalted.</HI> Let me therefore conjure by all that is &s;acred tho&s;e who have the&s;e <HI>appointments</HI> in their hands, never, never&punc; to let this be &s;een in our land! The&s;e hints mu&s;t &s;uffice at pre&s;ent. And I proceed,</P>
<P>II. <HI>As briefly, To con&s;ider the duty of peo|ple to their rulers.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eem'd meet to mention the <HI>duty of rulers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>duty</HI> of the <HI>people</HI> re&s;ults from their hone&s;t di&s;charge of it. And, if the rulers gro&s;sly neglect their du|ty, &s;o as to &s;ail of an&s;wering the end of their in&s;titution, e&s;pecially if they play the <HI>tyrant</HI> and <HI>de&s;troy</HI> what they were appoint|ed to pre&s;erve, common &s;en&s;e teaches, and we all agree, that they forfeit all <HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>re&s;pect.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="015703_0013_0F99E06FB6058F30">
The renown'd and excellent emperor <HI>Trajan</HI> order'd that the very <HI>prayers</HI> for him, &s;hould be <HI>conditional&mdash;if he ob&s;erves the laws&mdash;if he govern as he ought&mdash;if he make the people happy.</HI> The light of na|ture taught him this.</P>
<P>And yet, we ought to con&s;ider magi&s;|trates as <HI>men,</HI> and make allowance for <HI>hu|man frailties</HI> and <HI>mi&s;takes.</HI> And therefore, if they <HI>mean hone&s;tly</HI> and in any tolerable mea&s;ure an&s;wer the end of their advance|ment, e&s;pecially if they di&s;charge their du|ty, <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> and <HI>faithfully,</HI> the people's duty to them cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with, any more than other duties, on pain of eternal <HI>damnation.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;uch ca&s;es they are bound not only by fear of wrath, but for <HI>con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> For &s;uch an <HI>ordinance of man</HI> is <HI>God'</HI>s <HI>ordi|nance</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>But, depend upon it, <HI>no government is God's ordinance,</HI> but that which is for <HI>the good of mankind:</HI> it would be the gro&s;&s;e&s;t reflection on the <HI>divine goodne&s;s</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e it! Nay, I think, but little &s;hort of <HI>bla&s;|phemy!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="015703_0014_0F99E070D5ED8298">
But, to <HI>good rulers</HI> the people owe&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Honor</HI> and <HI>re&s;pect.</HI> 'Tis ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e the people &s;hould choo&s;e tho&s;e to <HI>lead</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> them, who are not thought worthy of the&s;e by the electors! How ab|&s;urd then to deny it!</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Obedience.</HI> For the people to choo&s;e men to be <HI>rulers</HI> and call them &s;o; and not readily obey them, when acting in charac|ter, is to make them&s;elves contemptible.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Tribute,</HI> is due, in order to their ho|norable &s;upport, and to carry on the great affairs of government.</P>
<P>As <HI>no man goeth a warfare at his own charges,</HI> &s;o 'tis ab&s;urd to expect <HI>magi&s;trates</HI> to devote them&s;elves to the public, with|out an adequate reward for their important &s;ervice.</P>
<P>And, at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, when all lies at &s;take, it is impo&s;&s;ible but <HI>taxes</HI> and <HI>tribute</HI> mu&s;t run high. And, when <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> they &s;hould be readily paid, unle&s;s they out-run all the benefit, which can hardly be, where <HI>property, liberty</HI> and <HI>life,</HI> are all at &s;take to|gether! To talk of <HI>expence</HI> in &s;uch a ca&s;e,
<PB N="16" REF="015703_0015_0F99E071306C0AB8">
is to <HI>dream.</HI> For 'till it be determined whether we have any thing or not, what is <HI>expence to us?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Another duty of the people is to <HI>de|fend their magi&s;trates,</HI> in time of danger, again&s;t all attempts of bloody men.</P>
<P>In times of danger, like the pre&s;ent, whether we con&s;ider it or not, <HI>they,</HI> and all <HI>others,</HI> who go <HI>foremo&s;t,</HI> are peculiar marks of the enemies vengeance: and therefore every man in who&s;e cau&s;e they act, is bound in <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>con&s;cience</HI> to <HI>&s;tand by and defend</HI> them.</P>
<P>And, how &s;hocking a crime, how di&s;|graceful to humanity, would it be to de|&s;ert them, (the mo&s;t <HI>honorable Pre&s;ident</HI> of our <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> and our incomparable Gene|ral, for example) and leave them to fall a &s;acrifice to the fury of the enemy! Should we be capable of &s;uch meanne&s;s, we &s;hould never de&s;erve to have another friend? But I proceed</P>
<P>III. <HI>To take a brief view of the oppre&s;&s;ions of the rulers of the world.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="015703_0016_0F99E071F9C790A0">
To pretend to give a particular hi&s;tory of this, would be almo&s;t the &s;ame thing as to give the <HI>hi&s;tory of the world,</HI> from <HI>Cain</HI> to <HI>Nimrod,</HI> and from him to <HI>Nebuchadnez|zar,</HI> and from him to <HI>Alexander,</HI> and from him to <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and from <HI>Julius</HI> to <HI>George!</HI></P>
<P>Nor could any, who have the common feelings of humanity, bear the tragical &s;tory, without growing almo&s;t &s;tiff with horror! For, it is almo&s;t one continued &s;cene of <HI>cruelty, blood</HI> and <HI>&s;laughter!</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have never felt the weight of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions, nor enter'd much into the hi&s;tory of them, can form no idea of them!</P>
<P>Men are, to their &s;hame, in general, too much tyrants to one another. I wi&s;h the pre&s;ent day were not, to the grief of all good men, too much a witne&s;s of this, while we are all &s;uffering together unpar|rallel'd oppre&s;&s;ions from the common Enemy!</P>

<P>And &s;o, in a multitude of in&s;tances, the <HI>remedy</HI> has prov'd un&s;peakably wor&s;e than the <HI>di&s;ea&s;e!</HI></P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of all in power is to <HI>de|fend</HI> the <HI>lives, liberties</HI> and <HI>property</HI> of the <HI>people:</HI> And they have no other bu&s;ine&s;s: And yet every one of the&s;e have the great tyrants of the world invaded! they have not only <HI>robb'd</HI> and <HI>&s;poil'd,</HI> them of their <HI>property</HI> by their <HI>violent exactions</HI> and by engaging them in <HI>needle&s;s wars,</HI> to gratify their own <HI>lu&s;t, ambition</HI> and <HI>avarice!</HI> but at length ro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch of arrogance, as to claim the <HI>people</HI> and all they had as their <HI>property,</HI> to be di&s;pos'd of at their plea&s;ure, as if all the <HI>people</HI> were made for them and not they for the people!</P>
<P>One would think this was <HI>tyranny</HI> and <HI>&s;laverly compleat!</HI>&mdash;And yet they

<P><HI>Power,</HI> e&s;pecially over-grown power, whets the ambition and &s;ets all the witts to work to enlarge it.

<P>Be not therefore di&s;mayed; but do your utmo&s;t, we entreat you, to <HI>defend</HI> the land, and re&s;tore it's <HI>tranquility:</HI> And, in a word, to make the people <HI>wi&s;e, virtuous</HI> and <HI>hap|py:</HI> And, a&s;&s;uredly, all generations will then ri&s;e up and <HI>call you ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>And as to the affairs of this day, &s;uffer me to entreat every one concerned, to con&s;ider the <HI>great</HI> importance of a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good choice</HI> at this cri&s;is of our affairs; and therefore do nothing by partiality, but in the <HI>fear of God,</HI> and with a &s;ingle eye to his glory and the be&s;t &s;ervice of this

<P>Search, I pray you, and &s;ee wherefore it was that the Lord hath dealt thus with you.</P>
<P>I know indeed, that your forwardne&s;s in the public cau&s;e was what provoked the enemy: But &s;ee, I be&s;eech you what it was that provoked God to &s;uffer it. And <HI>amend</HI> what is ami&s;s.</P>

And be very <HI>thankful</HI> to God for &s;o wonderful a deliverance, and render unto him according to the mighty benefits re|ceived.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, adopt I pray you the language of <HI>Ezra,</HI> (<HI>Ezra</HI> ix. 13, 14) <HI>And after all that is come upon us&mdash;&s;eeing that thou our God ha&s;t puni&s;hed us le&s;s than our iniquities de&s;erve, and ha&s;t given us &s;uch deliverance as this, &s;hould we again break thy commandments,&mdash;woulde&s;t thou not be angry with us till thou had&s;t con&s;umed us, &s;o that there &s;hould be no remnant nor e&s;caping.</HI></P>

<P>O my brethren, God's <HI>judgments</HI> are now <HI>abroad</HI> in all the land, and he ju&s;tly expects that we <HI>learn righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> How melan|cholly is it that we &s;ee no more of it!

Nothing <HI>is,</HI> nothing <HI>can be,</HI> more un|&s;eemly than to <HI>oppre&s;s one another,</HI> while we are all groaning under <HI>public oppre&s;|&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>enemy,</HI> and crying to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>man</HI> for help! <HI>Bani&s;h it, bani&s;h</HI> it, from the land, I pray you.

<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, there is a &s;ufficiency in the land, of the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and if &s;omebody is not wanting, all the poor may be &s;upplied. And as to many, if not mo&s;t, foreign articles of great importance, there is undoubtedly a con&s;iderable &s;up|ply.

A little <HI>conde&s;cention</HI> and <HI>good-nature,</HI> on both &s;ides, would ea&s;ily &s;et all to rights. And they who go foremo&s;t in rectifying this matter, will be the mo&s;t <HI>honorable,</HI> let who would begin it.</P>
<P>And, as all depends upon the <HI>divine pre&s;ence</HI> and <HI>ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> let us do our utmo&s;t to engage them by earne&s;t <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>&s;up|plication;</HI> yea and by <HI>turning every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands</HI> (as the king of Nine|veh well expre&s;&s;ed it) <HI>who knows but the Lord will think upon us for good, that we peri&s;h not?</HI> Yea more, I <HI>doubt not,</HI> that upon this the Lord will be with us and <HI>maintain our righteous cau&s;e,</HI> again&s;t an <HI>ungodly nation.</HI></P>
