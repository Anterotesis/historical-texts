<Q><HI>Happy art thou O I&s;rael: who is like unto thee, O people &s;aved by the Lord, the &s;hield of thy help, and who is the &s;word of thy excellency!&mdash;</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE great God who is the &s;ove|reign of the univer&s;e, is the foun|tain and &s;ource of happine&s;s: As he hath given exi&s;tence to &s;ocieties and public bodies of men, as well as to individuals, &s;o all the happine&s;s which they have &s;hared in, and enjoyed, has come from him, the divine benefactor.</P>
<P>This every thoughtful per&s;on mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of: e&s;pecially they who have been elevated above the common level of man|kind,
<PB N="6" REF="010569_0005_0F80BC49E33C14A0">
and have been capable of taking notice of the wonderful operations, in the cour&s;e of divine providence, which have tended to the good of &s;ocieties, who&s;e hi&s;tory they have been acquainted with&mdash;and &s;uch as they have lived in, and to whom in &s;ome &s;phere they have mini&s;tred&mdash;and more e&s;pecially yet, if they have been, or are, per&s;ons of religion and piety.</P>
<P>Through the great and di&s;tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s of the mo&s;t high God the people of I&s;rael, who de&s;cended from the good patriarch Jacob and in Egypt grew, to be a great people, were at length delivered from thence by a mighty hand, and were formed into a civil &s;ociety, or body politic.</P>
<P>This &s;ociety was &s;pecially and peculiarly happy and ble&s;&s;ed: And the words of our text are a high encomium on the happine&s;s and felicity of that people, uttered by Mo&s;es, who had a perfect knowledge of their &s;tate and condition, who had been the in&s;trument of their deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ions of a proud, de&s;potic, cruel, prince, and who
<PB N="7" REF="010569_0006_0F80BC4A9D1C4158">
under God was the founder of their &s;tate, their chief magi&s;trate, king and ruler.</P>
<P>At a convention of the heads of the peo|ple, and of the tribes of I&s;rael, he pronounc|ed a ble&s;&s;ing upon each tribe, and by the &s;pirit of prophecy, he foretold the peculiar ble&s;&s;ings, which in &s;ome future periods &s;hould come upon them. Having done thus, he pronounces the whole Hebrew nation, or the whole I&s;rael of God, ble&s;&s;ed: and more than intimates the &s;pecial and peculiar favor of God, which they &s;hould experience in the promi&s;ed land, the land of Canaan, which they were then upon the borders of, and which they &s;hould &s;peedily pa&s;s over to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>But, as if all this &s;hould be con&s;idered in a prophetic light and view only, or as relat|ing to the &s;pecial tokens of the divine favor to them, in time to come; he &s;peaks in our text of their then happy &s;tate and condition.</P>
<P>He had been with them as a faithful guardian, as a good &s;ervant of God; as a kind father, as a great benefactor&mdash;He had been witne&s;s to all that the Lord had done
<PB N="8" REF="010569_0007_0F80BC4B2FAB7DC0">
for them&mdash;how that the Lord had delivered and defended them from their enemies, and in every re&s;pect had provided for, and &s;upported them&mdash;and therefore he declared them happy and ble&s;&s;ed; eminently and di&s;|tingui&s;hedly &s;o, in the favor of the Lord Jehovah: <HI>Happy art thou O I&s;rael: who is like unto thee, O people &s;aved by the Lord, the &s;hield of thy help, and who is the &s;word of thy excellency!</HI> The &s;hield and the &s;word are here u&s;ed figuratively, and denote the divine care, the goodne&s;s and beneficence of the God of I&s;rael, in protecting and de|fending his people from the de&s;igns and at|tacks of their enemies, in giving them victory over them, and e&s;tabli&s;hing them as a &s;ociety, over which God him&s;elf was their immediate ruler and governor. So that all their deli|verances, all their greatne&s;s, all their power and authority, all their &s;afety, in a word all their excellency of every &s;ort, is here attri|buted to God, by this his faithful &s;ervant. A pattern this, worthy the imitation of the greate&s;t potentates and legi&s;lators on earth!</P>
<P>But it is worthy our notice, with what a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, and real &s;atisfaction, Mo&s;es
<PB N="9" REF="010569_0008_0F80BC4B78EF64C8">
the chief magi&s;trate of the Hebrew common|wealth &s;peaks of the happine&s;s of his people. <HI>Happy art thou, O I&s;rael, who is like unto thee, O people &s;aved by the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. What people in the whole world have been &s;o di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the God of Heaven as thou art? what favors have been be&s;towed on thee? how art thou &s;aved from out of the hands of thine enemies? and how art thou rai&s;ed to a peculiar pitch of honor and great|ne&s;s, beyond all the nations and people in the world? Surely thou art highly favoured by the mo&s;t high God, who is eminently the God of thy &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved yet further, that Mo&s;es was about to leave them, and to leave the world too, and to give up his account to God, the judge of all the earth. He had met, indeed, with many great and &s;ore trials and conflicts in the cour&s;e of his admini&s;tra|tion of government among them. For though they were di&s;tingui&s;hed greatly by the favors of Heaven, yet they had not been the mo&s;t tractable; yea they had been a re|bellious people, and had provoked him, &s;o <HI>that he had &s;poken unadvi&s;edly with his lips.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="010569_0009_0F80BC4FD7600628">
And, being provoked by them, he offended God, and was debarred an entrance into the land of Canaan, and was called to re&s;ign up his commi&s;&s;ion, his civil power and dig|nity, into the hands of another, who was appointed by God to be his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and to partake of mortality, the common lot of all the children of men. Yet for all this, he di&s;covers a peculiar &s;atisfaction, a heart-felt joy and gladne&s;s, in &s;eeing and beholding their pre&s;ent, as well as their future happine&s;s&mdash;neither the contra|dictions of <HI>a &s;tiff-necked people,</HI> nor the views and pro&s;pects of a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution, could abate, much le&s;s annihilate, the love he bare to them, or the delight and &s;atisfaction he enjoyed on account of that &s;ingular pitch of glory and grandeur, which they had ar|rived unto.</P>
<P>Surely then, this great and good ruler, mu&s;t have had &s;ome noble and excellent principles operating in him, exceedingly dif|fering from tho&s;e which have operated in many, &s;ince him, who have a&s;&s;umed to them|&s;elves the character of patriots, and be|nefactors of mankind; which, however for

a time, di&s;gui&s;ed under a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">air &s;hew, or &s;ome plau&s;ible colourings, have frequently di&s;covered them&s;elves in the end, to be but low and mercenary and &s;elfi&s;h. I &s;ay the&s;e principles which operated in the Hebrew law-giver, mu&s;t have been truly religious ones, and therefore noble and generous and di&s;|intere&s;ted; &s;uch, as were worthy of God, by his grace, to in&s;pire him with, and &s;uch as were productive of the mo&s;t excellent and beneficent actions.</P>
<P>In fine, he con&s;idered his people as beings of the &s;ame &s;pecies with him&s;elf, as entitled to many great and &s;pecial rights and privi|leges, yea as the people of God&mdash;him&s;elf as the &s;ervant of God, his mini&s;ter, rai&s;ed up by him, and cloathed with his authori|ty, not meerly that he might be elevated above the multitude of his brethren, or that he might avail him&s;elf of the honours and emoluments of his high office, but that he might act for God, and as far as &s;hould be in his power, promote their good and happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010569_0011_0F80BC5231CFDC90">
A ruler po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and actuated by, &s;uch noble principles as the&s;e, mu&s;t needs have had an eye, as to the will of his ma&s;ter in his conduct, in the cour&s;e of his admini|&s;tration, &s;o to the reward of his &s;ervices in a future &s;tate, or in a better world, and thus Mo&s;es is &s;aid by the Apo&s;tle, to have had <HI>a re&s;pect to the recompence of reward.</HI> This, as it was con&s;i&s;tent with truly generous prin|ciples, was the effect of faith in God, and his word and promi&s;e. If this excellent ruler had not had a firm faith in God and a &s;olid hope as to futurity, and of his being graciou&s;ly accepted of God and rewarded in the heavenly world, he could not have &s;o willingly and heroically re&s;igned up his authority, and &s;o readily have embraced death, as he did, or at lea&s;t, not with &s;o calm a mind, notwith&s;tanding he had as great a love to his people, and delight and &s;atisfaction in their happine&s;s, as he po&s;&s;ibly could have had, upon the principles of rea&s;on only.</P>
<P>But if I di&s;cour&s;e further, let it be upon the&s;e topics, which I think fairly pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us, from what we have al|ready &s;aid, by way of explanation of, or re|mark upon our text,&mdash;viz.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="010569_0012_0F80BC524395E860">
The happine&s;s of a people&mdash;the governing principles of a good ruler&mdash;and the &s;atisfacti|on which &s;uch a ruler feels in his own brea&s;t, in &s;eeing the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of his people, in the cour&s;e of his admini&s;tration, and in clo&s;ing the &s;cene of his action.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t place</HI> then, I would &s;ay &s;ome|thing further concerning the happine&s;s of a people.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of a people, we would be under&s;tood as meaning a &s;ociety of men, in a civil relation to each other. The great God, who gave to man his being, hath made him capable of &s;ocial duties, and &s;ocial com|forts; yea, according to his nature and con|&s;titution, he is formed for many important &s;ervices, which he owes to beings of the &s;ame rank and &s;pecies with him&s;elf, and which he ought to yield, in &s;ome particular &s;phere, according to his ability&mdash;and unle&s;s he partakes of, and &s;hares in, a variety of &s;ervices and benefits of his fellow creatures, he in no wi&s;e partakes of that happine&s;s which he is capable of in the pre&s;ent world.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010569_0013_0F80BC530BB5C1C8">
Solitude is a &s;tate incompatible with the benevolent de&s;igns of Heaven toward man|kind, and repugnant to their natural notions and de&s;ires. Hence it is, that although there is a natural equality and independency among men, yet they have voluntarily combined to|gether, and by compact and mutual agree|ment, have entered into a &s;ocial &s;tate, and bound them&s;elves to the performance of a multitude of affairs, tending to the good; and to the avoiding of a multitude of inju|ries tending to the hurt and damage of the whole. And hence ari&s;es order and govern|ment, and a ju&s;t regulation of all tho&s;e mat|ters which relate to the &s;afety of the per&s;ons, lives, liberties, and property of individuals.</P>
<P>Thus, the happine&s;s of men is better promoted and &s;ecured, than it would be, if every one was to indulge him&s;elf in an ab|&s;olute independency and made his own will the rule of his actions. And hence al&s;o it may be &s;aid, that government originates in the will of God, and the nece&s;&s;ities of man|kind.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010569_0014_0F80BC53DF7EA710">
If we let our thoughts run a little further upon civil government, we &s;hall &s;ee, that it is a merciful in&s;titution or ordinance of Heaven, to the lap&s;ed world of mankind&mdash;<HI>The pow|ers that be are ordained of God.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;upream ruler and governor of the univer&s;e hath &s;o adju&s;ted things in the moral world, as that order and government are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the advancing his own glory, and the promoting the good of his rational, in|telligent creatures&mdash;and it is very obvious that anarchy and confu&s;ion, mu&s;t terminate in the de&s;truction of mens lives, as well as of their liberty and property.</P>
<P>The form of civil government is not of divine appointment; this is left by God very much to the will and determination of men, and depends upon a people's temper, genius, &s;ituation and advantages or di&s;advantages of various kinds. But yet that form of govern|ment which is adopted and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;ent and agreement of the body of the people, and which is found by experience to be conducive to the common good and intere&s;t of the &s;ociety, is that which &s;eems to
<PB N="16" REF="010569_0015_0F80BC54797C08B0">
be agreeable to the divine will&mdash;Though per|haps &s;ome particular forms of government may look as if they were repugnant to the will of Heaven, inasmuch as they tend to the en&s;laving and abu&s;ing of the &s;ubject, Yet (at lea&s;t) the&s;e are permitted by him, <HI>who doth his will in the army of Heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed this difference or variety re|lative to the forms of civil government, which have been, and which do now exi&s;t in the world, affords a very good rea&s;on why one nation and people, is &s;aid to be more happy as to the con&s;titution of civil government, than another. From hence it follows, that no people have been perfectly and compleatly happy in this re&s;pect; becau&s;e no people have as yet had &s;uch a perfect form of govern|ment, as hath admitted of, and been attended with no inconveniencies, (unle&s;s you will ex|cept the theocracy of the Hebrews) and, it is probable, an ab&s;olutely perfect form of civil government is incon&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, and with the &s;tate and condi|tion of man, the admini&s;trator of it, in this world of &s;in and imperfection.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010569_0016_0F80BC554E8FA558">
In a word here, <HI>a good con&s;titution of go|vernment,</HI> &s;uch an one as &s;ecures the mutual dependence of the &s;overeign or ruling pow|ers, and the people on each other, and which &s;ecures the rights of each, and the good of the whole &s;ociety, is a great ble&s;&s;ing to a people.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this of government, I would go on, and &s;ay, that the happine&s;s of a peo|ple depends very much upon their having <HI>good laws.</HI></P>
<P>Now laws may be &s;aid to be good, when they are &s;uch as tend to the promoting of the good of the &s;ociety, and of individuals in it&mdash;or, they are good, when they tend to the &s;ecuring and e&s;tabli&s;hing the liberties and privileges of men; which are derived to them in the nature and rea&s;on of things; which they are entitled unto, by the con&s;ti|tution of the government they have volunta|rily engaged to &s;ubmit to; and which are confirmed to them by the revealed will of God.</P>
<P>And I will add here, that only &s;uch laws as the&s;e, are fit for the government of rational, intelligent, moral agents, all equal
<PB N="18" REF="010569_0017_0F80BC561E2A88C0">
and upon a par, antecedent to any political combinations among men; and after all, entitled to certain immunities and benefits, as members of the body politic; &s;o that they are not only good, but the be&s;t which an|&s;wer the&s;e great ends in the be&s;t manner. Ac|cordingly, a people are happy when the end of the&s;e laws, is in a good or great mea&s;ure an&s;wered: that is, when government is exer|ci&s;ed upon a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and proper ba&s;is, and is not abu&s;ed by &s;erving the pur|po&s;es of ambition, u&s;urpation and tyranny.&mdash;when the true honor of government is &s;up|ported, and the people are &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, quiet, free from unea&s;ine&s;s and tumult, peaceable and pro&s;perous.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not enlarge.</P>
<P>In the next place I would &s;ay, that <HI>good rulers</HI> are conducive to the happine&s;s of a people, or civil &s;ociety&mdash;As the laws mu&s;t be good, &s;o mu&s;t they who are more e&s;peci|ally entru&s;ted with the laws, be good.</P>
<P>Now as &s;ome laws, or rules of right con|duct, are nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t, prior or antecedent to the exi&s;tence of particular &s;oci|eties; which laws have their foundation, in the
<PB N="19" REF="010569_0018_0F80BC56CE214F40">
rea&s;on of things, the nature of man, and a|bove all the will of God, the &s;upreme law|giver; &s;o the&s;e laws are above, or &s;uperior unto the greate&s;t Sovereigns or rulers in the world, as well as their &s;ubjects.&mdash;This I pre&s;ume will ju&s;tify me, in &s;aying &s;ome|thing of tho&s;e laws before I &s;pake of them, who are &s;pecially concerned with the laws.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;overeigns, and &s;ome &s;ubordinate rulers, have a &s;hare in the power of legi&s;la|tion; that is, as the circum&s;tances and exi|gences of the &s;tate require, and as experi|ence elucidates their nece&s;&s;ity and utility, they may make, and they mu&s;t make new laws&mdash;but then they mu&s;t be &s;uch, as are couched in, and entirely con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e laws, which had an exi&s;tence prior to the exi&s;tence of the &s;tate, and tho&s;e upon which the &s;tate was founded, if rightly foun|ded, or el&s;e the con&s;titution will be receed|ed from, and altered&mdash;and this cannot be done ju&s;tly or righteou&s;ly, without the voice and con&s;ent of the people.</P>
<P>The good ruler then is one, who hath a knowledge and under&s;tanding of the na|ture

true of the con&s;titution of the government of the civil body he belongs to, and is a member of&mdash;It is to be pre&s;umed that he prefers this form of government before ano|ther form, yea, before all others, that he will be concerned to maintain and &s;upport the con&s;titution by pre&s;erving, as much as in him lieth, the rights and prerogatives of the &s;overeign or ruling power, and the li|berties and privileges of the people. That he will &s;hew a tender regard to the laws which already are&mdash;and <HI>if he hath a &s;hare in the legi&s;lative power,</HI> he will be concer|ned to frame and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch laws, as are con&s;i&s;tent with the principles and intere&s;t of the whole &s;ociety&mdash;He will never aim at e&s;|tabli&s;hing tyranny, or at promoting de&s;potic and arbitrary mea&s;ures, &s;ubver&s;ive of the rights and liberties of the people, though it were to the aggrandizing Maje&s;ty or &s;ove|reignty it&s;elf&mdash;nor on the other hand at the degrading of government by unrea&s;onable oppo&s;itions thereto, or by unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions or reflections, upon &s;overeigns or &s;ubordi|nate magi&s;trates, or by promoting the things which terminate in licentiou&s;ne&s;s, though thereby he could render him&s;elf popular.
<PB N="21" REF="010569_0020_0F80BC5841F47148">
<HI>If he hath a &s;hare in the executive power,</HI> he will &s;et him&s;elf to enforce the laws, and to cau&s;e them to operate to the good ends for which they were de&s;igned, that is, the re&s;training and reforming all irregularities and di&s;orders, by puni&s;hing (in a due pro|portion) the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient; by pro|moting the peace and pro&s;perity and happi|ne&s;s of the whole and of individuals&mdash;by protecting and &s;upporting the innocent, and them who are good &s;ubjects, as al&s;o by con|ferring honors and be&s;towing rewards (in a due proportion al&s;o) upon them who di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by &s;ome important &s;ervices, to their king and country.</P>
<P>In the&s;e re&s;pects a people may be &s;aid to be happy, to what they are, who live in and under governments entirely monarchical, or under princes or &s;overeigns, who are de&s;potic and tyrannical; and who make their own corrupt wills the rule of their conduct to|ward their &s;ubjects, or rather their &s;laves and va&s;&s;als&mdash;The &s;tate and condition of &s;uch people is abject and &s;ervile, they in no wi&s;e enjoy that freedom which all men, as <HI>the offspring of God</HI> have a natural right unto&mdash;

Their rulers are &s;courges, not benefactors to them; and they, that is the people, are made to feel innumerable troubles and infelicities which their brethren under a more happy con&s;titution of civil government know nothing of&mdash;But perhaps I may &s;ug|ge&s;t &s;omething further concerning the good ruler, when I come to &s;peak of the govern|ing principles of &s;uch an one.</P>

But the be&s;t men &s;ee and acknowledge that it re&s;ults from the relation between God the creator and governor of the world and men, his rea&s;onable creatures, his right of governing them, and their duty to &s;ubmit to, and obey him&mdash;And the&s;e &s;en|timents are founded not only upon the rea|&s;on of things, but al&s;o upon the &s;olemn de|clarations of God him&s;elf, in his own injunc|tions upon men, in his holy word.</P>

<P>And to be &s;ure this will give an opportu|nity to the wicked, (I would here intend the politically wicked) to rai&s;e a clamour a|gain&s;t &s;uch faithful &s;ervants of the public;

<P>And this mu&s;t be great, real and &s;olid.

<P>But mo&s;t certainly the heart of the good and pious ruler mu&s;t dilate with joy, when he &s;ees that the &s;cene of his action is drawing to a clo&s;e, when he &s;ees him&s;elf about to re&s;ign up his high office and his peculiar betru&s;tments to others, who &s;hall come after him, and under God conduct the great affairs of government, and the things which belong to the peace and happine&s;s of his people.</P>
