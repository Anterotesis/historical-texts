<Q><HI>For I de&s;ire mercy and not &s;acrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The preacher is &s;en&s;ible that many will &s;uppo&s;e the text improper for the occa&s;ion. It was cho&s;en by the pri&s;oner, and he could not be &s;o well plea&s;ed with another. It appeared that what he &s;uppo&s;ed Divine light, and an a&s;toni&s;hing view of God's character, broke in upon his mind, in reading this pa&s;&s;age.</NOTE></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE cho&s;en the&s;e words for the &s;ubject of my di&s;cour&s;e, by the particular de&s;ire of the unhappy man, who is to be executed this day.&mdash;He con&s;iders him&s;elf held up before mankind, as a warning of the bitter con&s;equences of &s;in; and the danger of living immorally and thoughtle&s;s of God. He has de&s;ired me to employ the pre&s;ent &s;hort opportunity, which we have for religious wor|&s;hip, both in advi&s;ing him for his &s;olemn appear|ance before the tribunal of his Judge, and in re|minding tho&s;e who are &s;pectators, that unle&s;s we
<PB N="4" REF="032888_0003_0FF5C6D2AC27AE30">
repent we &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h; and that tho&s;e who forget God, and di&s;obey his commandments, though they may e&s;cape an ignominious end in this world, mu&s;t in eternity expect to meet evils more dreadful than the pain or &s;hame of an execution by the hands of men.</P>
<P>THE occa&s;ion is very &s;olemn and affecting. I hope we may improve the hour in receiving in|&s;truction from this &s;pectacle, and in earne&s;t prayer that the man who is &s;oon to die, may find mercy and &s;alvation in God before whom he is &s;oon to come.</P>
<P>THE &s;cripture of which my text is a part, de&s;|cribes the &s;in of men; the rea&s;on of God's di&s;|plea&s;ure with them; and the nece&s;&s;ity and wi&s;dom of his judgments.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, Fir&s;t, paraphra&s;e the text in connexion with the context.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, make &s;uch an improvement as na|turally ari&s;es from the pa&s;&s;age and from the oc|ca&s;ion of our meeting.</P>
<P>IN the ver&s;es before the text God &s;ays, <HI>O E|phraim what &s;hall I do unto thee? O Judah what &s;hall I do unto thee? for your goodne&s;s is as a morn|ing cloud, and as the early dew it pa&s;&s;eth away.&mdash;Therefore have I hewed them by my prophets; I have &s;lain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judg|ments are as the light that goeth forth. They like men have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the covenant, there have they
<PB N="5" REF="032888_0004_0FF5C6D447B47D08">
dealt treacherou&s;ly again&s;t me.</HI> This is a de&s;cription of their conduct, as it was &s;een by the eye of Om|ni&s;cience. Our text al&s;o de&s;cribes the temper and practice to which forgivene&s;s is encouraged. <HI>For I de&s;ire mercy more than &s;acrifice; and the know|ledge of God more than burnt offerings.</HI> Mercy and a knowledge of God, in this pa&s;&s;age, mean true holine&s;s and a conformity of heart to the moral character of God, and &s;piritual obedience to his commandments. The men whom our text re|proved, had the means of religion and a doctrinal acquaintance with their duty. They had knowl|edge, in&s;truction, and warning, as we have at the pre&s;ent day. They &s;ometimes re&s;olved and prom|i&s;ed a religious life, and from the&s;e tran&s;ient re&s;o|lutions of an awakened hour, they hoped God would be merciful; but God &s;ays, their goodne&s;s or con&s;ideration was as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that pa&s;&s;eth away. They re&s;olved to &s;erve God, only when they feared his judg|ments, and were forced to con&s;ideration, by &s;ome melancholy &s;pectacle of the danger of &s;in, as we are at the pre&s;ent moment. God hewed them by his prophets&mdash;He warned them by the mini&s;ters of religion, of the end to which they mu&s;t come without repentance;&mdash;He flew them by the words of his mouth,&mdash;by his law and threatnings, de|nounced the certain con&s;equences of forgetting him and his commandments. Becau&s;e judgment again&s;t their evil works was not in&s;tantly executed, they determined God to be like them&s;elves, and hoped there was no evil to come. To teach them there was an evil to come, his judgments were as a light that &s;hineth. The judgments of God in
<PB N="6" REF="032888_0005_0FF5C6D5E66E5D18">
this world are mo&s;t wonderfully appointed. The &s;tate of probation in which men are placed, forbids the full execution of ju&s;tice upon them.&mdash;This would be incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch u&s;e of means as are appointed unto repentance; &s;till if there were no judgments they would wholly forget God. He therefore appoints his judgments in wonderful wi&s;|dom, &s;o as not to prevent a &s;tate of trial, and at the &s;ame time remind us that the wages of &s;in are death. There are &s;o many of God's judgments on &s;in, that if our hearts are &s;et to do evil becau&s;e the full puni&s;hment is not &s;peedily executed, the conduct is mo&s;t unrea&s;onable. His judgments are as a light that goeth forth, confirming the &s;en|tence of his law, that the wages of &s;in are death. They have been &s;o from the beginning, and are before our eyes on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN further de&s;cribing tho&s;e whom God reproved, he &s;ays, they like men tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the covenant, and dealt treacherou&s;ly again&s;t him.&mdash;A &s;inful life, in the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who indulge them|&s;elves, may fitly be called treachery. In &s;ome ge|neral &s;en&s;e, they profe&s;s to believe he is God, and promi&s;e to obey him; but where the heart is di&s;|obedient, and his character and law are not rev|erenced and loved, the whole is a treacherous pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and if tho&s;e who make it, are ever brought to &s;ee God and them&s;elves truly, they will be &s;en|&s;ible it is the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE character drawn in the context applies to a great variety of per&s;ons. To tho&s;e who again&s;t knowledge live in the vicious indulgence of their
<PB N="7" REF="032888_0006_0FF5C6DF19B1CA10">
pa&s;&s;ions and appetites:&mdash;Who having &s;ufficient ev|idence there is a God, go thro' days and years in forgetfulne&s;s of him, in impiety, profanene&s;s, think|ing only of time, the world and pre&s;ent amu&s;e|ments:&mdash;To tho&s;e who do not realize their obli|gation to live for the glory of their maker:&mdash;To tho&s;e, who&s;e minds are &s;o much taken up with pre&s;ent things, as to forget they are &s;oon to die and come into judgment:&mdash;To tho&s;e who live with|out prayer and in neglect of the in&s;titution of re|ligion; and to all who have not a &s;upreme love of God, his law and government.&mdash;The great defect of all &s;uch per&s;ons, is, they have not that holine&s;s, mercy and knowledge of God in their hearts and practice, in which true obedience con&s;i&s;ts. Being de&s;titute of a true love of God, and carnal and &s;elfi&s;h in their whole di&s;po&s;ition, and unfeeling of moral obligation, it is &s;trange they do not commit more of tho&s;e crimes that mu&s;t be puni&s;hed by the hand of civil ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>A want of love and obedience to God implies a heart capable of any other crime. He who fails in love, and is unju&s;t and treacherous to his God is certainly, by the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, capable of en|mity and treachery to his fellow-creatures. And when we &s;ee very many, who give no evidence of a delight in God; it mu&s;t be imputed to &s;pecial divine re&s;pect and care, that we are not much oft|ener called to &s;uch &s;olemn &s;cenes as are before us this day.&mdash;When we look on an unhappy man whom God hath left to expo&s;e him&s;elf to this death, we may fitly realize a di&s;tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s of God, that we are not in his place.&mdash;Though not
<PB N="8" REF="032888_0007_0FF5C6E0BA763B78">
under the &s;entence of human laws, we are condem|ned by the divine law. The goodne&s;s of the be&s;t hath been too much like a morning cloud. It is God's providence and not our own natural di&s;po|&s;itions, which hath pre&s;erved us from puni&s;hable crimes. There is no &s;afety in that evil heart, which deals treacherou&s;ly towards God, by not loving him; and which is de&s;titute of an experimental knowledge of his &s;anctifying grace. If we are &s;anctified by his holy &s;pirit, &s;overeign grace hath done the work; and if not &s;anctified, the only cau&s;e which pre&s;erves, is that Almighty power, which means to uphold a certain degree of order in the world. The be&s;t pre&s;ervative is mercy and a knowledge of God. The&s;e in our text, &s;tand oppo&s;ed to &s;acrifice and burnt offering. The fir&s;t means a holy conformity to the divine goodne&s;s, and a &s;anctifying knowledge of God and his com|mandments. This is a divine temper of the &s;oul, which re&s;i&s;ts temptation&mdash;makes &s;in appear hateful&mdash;and delights in glorifying God, and doing good to men. The la&s;t, &s;acrifice and burnt offering, as they &s;tand oppo&s;ed in the text to mercy and a know|ledge of the Lord, mean that general or formal or unaffecting belief of God, his law and our own du|ty; and that incon&s;tant attention to the in&s;titu|tions of religion, which are con&s;i&s;tent with a great|er love of the world and its intere&s;ts, of our&s;elves and our own lu&s;ts, than we have of God him&s;elf. In this, there is little efficacy for pre&s;ervation.&mdash;And all of this character, ought to feel that it is God's care of the world and not their own princi|ples, which keep them from &s;udden ruin in time and eternity. In tho&s;e principles of &s;in which de|ny
<PB N="9" REF="032888_0008_0FF5C6E25897E218">
God his right, men can find no &s;afety to them|&s;elves; nor can there be any &s;afety to the world. Public &s;afety in the mid&s;t of &s;uch principles, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the controling power of the Al|mighty; and when the time comes, either in this or the next world, that the &s;hining of his judg|ments is nece&s;&s;ary for general good, he will leave the &s;inner to &s;how him&s;elf and meet de&s;erved pun|i&s;hment.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, I am to make &s;uch an improvement of the &s;ubject, as naturally ari&s;es from the pa&s;&s;age that hath been paraphra&s;ed, and from the occa&s;ion of our meeting. And I &s;hall do this, Fir&s;t, with reference to the congregation at large. Secondly, in &s;pecial application to the unhappy man, who is to go from hence to the place of his execution.</P>
<P N="1">1. BOTH the &s;ubject and the occa&s;ion teach how much God is di&s;plea&s;ed with us, if we are not ho|ly and &s;anctified in our temper and practice. If we have not that true knowledge of God, which implies pure affections of the heart, our &s;tate is full of danger, both for time and eternity. The com|mon mercies and bounties of providence, are no evidence God is plea&s;ed with us, for the&s;e he be|&s;tows both on the good and the evil, the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t. How many ungrateful men he feeds and cloaths. To how many vicious men doth he grant the common pre&s;ervation of life, even pre|&s;erving them for a &s;ea&s;on, from the de&s;truction that naturally follows their criminal appetites and pa&s;&s;ions. God doth not this to encourage &s;in; but by an exhibition of his forbearance, to draw
<PB N="10" REF="032888_0009_0FF5C6E3F9CEEB70">
them to repentance, and to pre&s;erve the world in &s;uch a &s;tate of peace, as is the be&s;t probation for eternity. All who have not a true knowledge of God, are under his di&s;plea&s;ure. He doth not pre|&s;erve becau&s;e he is plea&s;ed with them. Their doc|trinal knowledge will not avert the final judgment. Their general profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity will not &s;ave them. Unle&s;s their hearts be changed the time will &s;oon come, either in this or another world, when the judgment of God will go forth again&s;t them, to &s;how his own holine&s;s, and to make his own kingdom very glorious.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. WE ought to con&s;ider the danger to our|&s;elves, that is inbred with the principles of &s;in and a departure from God. Sin cannot be made a &s;afe thing. The ingredients of a hell, both pre&s;ent and future, are in its very nature. Why are not the &s;inners of this world perfectly mi&s;erable beings at this moment? Not becau&s;e their principles do not lead to it; but God to an&s;wer his infinitely wi&s;e purpo&s;es, holds them from it. Sin admits no hap|pine&s;s in the enjoyment of God, nor in a view of his law and government. It de&s;troys peace of con|&s;cience and that inward harmony, which makes exi&s;tence ble&s;&s;ed. It counteracts all &s;ocial felicity, turning men's hands and hearts again&s;t one ano|ther. While a &s;inful creature dreads God as his Judge, he ought to dread him&s;elf as the immediate in&s;trument of his own wretchedne&s;s. He carries in his own bo&s;om the cau&s;e and means of his un|happine&s;s, and there can be no &s;afety to him in his own principles. In&s;tead of thinking hard of God, for tho&s;e evils which his &s;ins bring upon him,
<PB N="11" REF="032888_0010_0FF5C6EC78D77BB0">
he ought to adore that pre&s;erving goodne&s;s, which hath hitherto kept him from utter ruin.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. THIS occa&s;ion is a &s;olemn in&s;truction, not only in the dangerous nature of &s;inful principles in general, but of &s;everal particular kinds of &s;in, which are very prevalent among mankind. In|temperance is a &s;inful habit, which ruins a great number of mankind, and leads them to &s;uch high crimes as are capitally puni&s;hed by the laws of men. I am charged by my own con&s;cience, and de&s;ired by the unhappy man who &s;uffers this day, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to &s;peak freely of the dan|ger of this &s;in. Though this man hath hitherto denied any prepen&s;e, malicious intention of mur|der, he &s;peaks in mo&s;t feeling terms of the danger of &s;in, of forgetting God, and of an uncha&s;te, in|temperate life. He traces back mo&s;t of his unhap|pine&s;s in life, and e&s;pecially this awful &s;cene, to impure connexions and to intemperance. The &s;in of drunkenne&s;s hath been a principal means of bringing him to this ca&s;e. And he is only one of many thou&s;ands of mankind, who have come to the &s;ame end by the &s;ame means. A mind intox|icated with liquor, is prepared to mingle with the mo&s;t impure and abandoned companions, and to commit any violence. Almo&s;t every violence that takes place in civili&s;ed &s;ociety, and family unhappi|ne&s;s may be traced to intemperance as their cau&s;e. How many rational creatures it turns into bea&s;ts of prey! how many families it cloaths with rags and deprives of bread! how often it di&s;turbs the otherwi&s;e peaceful neighbourhood! how many it brings to death by the hand of public ju&s;tice! how
<PB N="12" REF="032888_0011_0FF5C6EE14767AC8">
many &s;ouls it ruins for both worlds!&mdash;Tho&s;e, who give them&s;elves up to this &s;in, ra&s;hly defy all po&s;|&s;ible mi&s;ery. This prevailing vice, is greatly pro|moted by tipling hou&s;es and dram &s;hops, where the incautious gradually acquire a habit which proves their ruin. Every &s;uch place is a deep e|vil in &s;ociety, and a nur&s;ery for murder and eter|nal ruin. I do not know any way in which the civil authority can make them&s;elves more worthy of re&s;pect, or do greater good to the public, who are placed under their care, than by a faithful ex|ecution of our good laws, again&s;t &s;uch places and again&s;t tho&s;e per&s;ons who give them&s;elves up to intemperance. If any think I &s;peak too freely on this &s;ubject, as my vindication, I beg them to look to that &s;pectacle now in our eyes.&mdash;Look to yon|der place of execution, around which we &s;hall &s;oon be gathered, to behold the mo&s;t awful of all &s;ights. And let us remember that this event is as a light which &s;hineth, teaching us the pre&s;ent nature of &s;in, and the more awful judgments of God on &s;uch as live and die unreformed.</P>
<P>I am in the la&s;t place to apply my&s;elf to the man who is &s;oon to die.</P>
<P><HI>My unhappy Fellow-Creature,</HI></P>
<P>I call you unhappy in the &s;ight of men, as one whom the holy providence of God appoints to an ignominious death. There is, neverthele&s;s, room for you to be eternally happy in the world to which you are &s;oon going. It is the glory of the go&s;pel, that it proclaims &s;alvation to the chief of repenting &s;in|ners, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If you have repented of
<PB N="13" REF="032888_0012_0FF5C6F03063E8B0">
all your &s;ins, you may go by this death to which you are appointed, to a heaven of glorious and e|ternal happine&s;s. If you have truly repented, the riches of divine grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the &s;ove|reignty of divine love will be glorified in plucking you as a brand out of the burning, from that vici|ous, incon&s;iderate and prayerle&s;s life, in which you acknowledge you have generally lived. If you have truly repented, you will thank God forever, even for the&s;e &s;evere means of &s;aving you from your &s;in. But remember that it is a hard que&s;|tion for men to determine, whether they have re|pented, and you have only an hour or two more to examine. I am &s;en&s;ible that you pro&s;e&s;s to be|lieve mo&s;t of tho&s;e doctrines, which Chri&s;tians ge|nerally receive; and al&s;o to hope that you have been forgiven by God, thro' a true repentance and faith. But as your eternal happine&s;s is depending, you cannot review this matter too clo&s;ely in the few moments you have left. Pray, pray earne&s;tly to God, that he would enlighten, while I make &s;ome remarks for your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The infinite goodne&s;s of God is an acknowledged truth; but this is no certain evidence you are going to happine&s;s, for his goodne&s;s may require him to puni&s;h you in another world as he doth in this.&mdash;Your doctrinal knowledge will not &s;ave; for the heart is often ve|ry bad, where the under&s;tanding is well indoctrin|ated.&mdash;Your own righteou&s;ne&s;s will not &s;ave you; for certainly, you have nothing of your own, but a life of &s;in to pre&s;ent before your Judge,&mdash;vi&s;ible &s;ins, and a heart full of &s;in and forgetfulne&s;s of your maker. It mu&s;t be pure go&s;pel&mdash;pure &s;ove|reign grace&mdash;pure &s;anctifying grace, that &s;aves you
<PB N="14" REF="032888_0013_0FF5C6F1C53530E0">
if you be &s;aved. If you feel as though there ever has been, or now is, any thing in you de&s;erving of God's favor; if you think your cries and prayers form any kind of challenge on God; this would prove you de&s;titute of true Chri&s;tian humility and &s;till unforgiven. Chri&s;t's promi&s;es in the go&s;pel are many and glorious; but you have no right to place any dependence on the&s;e, of being ever hap|py; unle&s;s your heart hath complied with the con|ditions on which they are made. They are made only to a holy repentance, and other gracious af|fections of the &s;ame moral nature. Every man will in &s;ome &s;en&s;e repent, when he meets the bitter fruits of &s;inning; but this is more properly called, mourning for the puni&s;hment than for the &s;in.&mdash;Hating mi&s;ery is no evidence of hating &s;in.&mdash;Fly|ing from puni&s;hment, is no evidence of flying from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IF your repentance be holy and &s;incere, you will mourn for your &s;ins, more on account of the di&s;|honor done to God, and his kingdom, than for the &s;hame and condemnation it brings on your&s;elf.&mdash;You will hate it as unrea&s;onable&mdash;as contrary to the mo&s;t &s;olemn moral obligation&mdash;and ba&s;e in its very nature.</P>
<P>A holy love, doth not ari&s;e from an apprehen|&s;ion, that God will be&s;tow great benefits on you per&s;onally.&mdash;To love God, only becau&s;e we think he loves us, is what every unforgiven, unholy &s;in|ner may do. The infinite perfection of God's na|ture, law and government, is the rea&s;on for which a true penitent loves him; and if he &s;uppo&s;ed that
<PB N="15" REF="032888_0014_0FF5C6F91C7412A8">
he &s;hould never be forgiven him&s;elf, he would &s;till &s;ay the Lord's character is lovely.</P>
<P>A &s;aving faith is a receiving of Chri&s;t, as glorious in his nature, whole character and offices.&mdash;To re|ly on him as a deliverer from puni&s;hment and not from &s;in, is not a gracious exerci&s;e.&mdash;To the true believer, Chri&s;t's power to &s;anctify appears like a mo&s;t excellent part of his mediatorial character.&mdash;If you are a go&s;pel penitent, you will feel a &s;en&s;i|ble love of God's law, and choo&s;e it as the rule of your affections, tho' you know it condemns you. You will &s;ay his providence is right&mdash;you will re|joice that he reigns, and have no de&s;ire to take the government from his hands.</P>
<P>I have plainly expre&s;&s;ed to you &s;ome principal Chri&s;tian exerci&s;es, by which you are in this &s;olemn moment to try your&s;elf. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that you po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e exerci&s;es, is the only certain evidence of God's mercy to you, and that you are prepared to die. If you have become a penitent man; tho' con&s;cious of your own total unworthine&s;s, it will be a plea&s;ure to you to pray to God, and to hum|ble your&s;elf before him in the deepe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of &s;elf aba&s;ement.&mdash;Prayer to God is the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful manner in which you can &s;pend the &s;hort re|mainder of your life.&mdash;Prayer will bring God in|to your view; and the more truly you &s;ee God, the more truly al&s;o you will &s;ee your&s;elf, and feel your guilt. Look to him to forgive a &s;inner, who de&s;erves nothing but to be eternally ca&s;t off. A&s;k mercy and the forgivene&s;s of your &s;ins, for the &s;ole &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF RICHARD DOANE, AS GIVEN BY HIMSELF; ALSO OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND DURING THE TIME OF HIS CONFINEMENT, AND AT HIS DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>THE man who was lately executed by the name of RICHARD DOANE, was &s;entenced to death, by the Superior Court in September, 1796, to be executed December 14th.&mdash;The General A&s;&s;embly, on his application at their October Se&s;&s;ion, repriev|ed him until June 10th, 1797, at which time he was executed for the murder of DANIEL M'IVER.</P>
<P>HE gave the following account of him&s;elf:&mdash;That he was born in a large city of Great-Britain, in the year 1755, of reputable parents.&mdash;That his father was a man of activity and bu&s;ine&s;s; his mo|ther, apparently, a woman of piety and much de|voted to the duties of religion. He was in&s;tructed
<PB N="18" REF="032888_0017_0FF5C6FEC59751F8">
in the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, in his youth, under one of the mo&s;t eminent divines of the day. He &s;aid that his connexion in marriage with a virtuous woman, to whom he was attached in affection from his early youth, contrary to the wi&s;hes of friends, was the cau&s;e of bringing him to America. That he refu&s;ed more lucrative em|ployments offered him by his friends, for the &s;ake of living with the object of his affections. His bu&s;ine&s;s was a &s;tone-cutter. He came into the &s;outhern part of the United States, where he liv|ed regularly and indu&s;triou&s;ly, until the death of his wife and their only child. He repre&s;ented her as a per&s;on of much virtue and di&s;cretion, and con&s;idered her death as the beginning of his real mi&s;fortunes. Her death threw him into a &s;tate of great dejection, for a con&s;iderable time, and di&s;|qualified him for bu&s;ine&s;s, when he began an in|temperate life as a remedy for &s;orrow. After &s;e|veral years he emerged from the gloom, and would labor indu&s;triou&s;ly for a number of weeks, and then in a fit of intoxication &s;pend his earnings and give him&s;elf up to profanene&s;s and impiety.</P>
<P>IT doth not appear that he was a malicious man, when free from the influence of &s;piritous liquor; but in his periods of intoxication was often abu|&s;ive, and was under this influence when he put an end to the life of M'Iver. A number of his la&s;t years were &s;pent in various towns of Connecticut and the vicinity of the &s;tate. In his la&s;t confine|ment he &s;poke with great abhorrence of his pa&s;t life. Drunkenne&s;s, profanene&s;s, and a connexion with evil women were the actual crimes of which
<PB N="19" REF="032888_0018_0FF5C70830ECDF30">
he appeared mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible. He &s;poke in mo&s;t feel|ing terms of the dreadful &s;tate of tho&s;e who indulge in the&s;e vices.&mdash;That they not only de&s;troy reputa|tion and health, and di&s;qualify for the confidence of mankind; but lead to every other &s;in, and pro|voke a Holy God to give up the &s;inner to the mo&s;t awful puni&s;hments, in this and another world.</P>
<P>MANY reports have circulated concerning &s;up|po&s;ed crimes committed by this man, which are doubtle&s;s without foundation. It was common for him in his &s;ea&s;ons of intoxication, to be abu&s;ive both in words and actions, as is u&s;ual in drunken people; but there is no evidence that when free from liquor he was malicious or dangerous.</P>
<P>THE man whom he murdered was one of his friends and companions, and the fatal affray aro&s;e wholly from intoxication.</P>
<P>PERHAPS none will que&s;tion that accidental in|toxication, le&s;&s;ens the criminality of the violence done in an irrational hour. The ca&s;e is far differ|ent with wilful and habitual drunkards. The&s;e per&s;ons, even if they lo&s;e memory, mu&s;t have been often informed of their own abu&s;e and violence. They ought to con&s;ider, that taking the bottle is taking the dagger; and though they have not any malice again&s;t particular individuals, the very act of drinking may be con&s;idered as malice again&s;t human nature. In this view Doane in his hours of repentance acknowledged his &s;entence to be a ju&s;t one, though he had no enmity again&s;t the man who&s;e life was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="032888_0019_0FF5C709CA9D6458">
SUCH in&s;tances as the&s;e, warn us, that it is the duty of tho&s;e who have authority, due both to the public, and to habitual drunkards them&s;elves, to place them in a &s;tate of confinement. Had this man, in due time, received the correction of the work-hou&s;e, it might have &s;aved him from the halter.</P>
<P>THOUGH it be not common for tho&s;e who have long lived a vicious life to find repentance, God &s;ometimes grants it to magnify the &s;overeignty and greatne&s;s of his mercy, and teach us to &s;eek his favor to the la&s;t hour.</P>
<P>IT is hoped, that this man was one of tho&s;e un|common in&s;tances of true repentance and grace.&mdash;Much pains were taken by neighbouring Chri&s;t|ians, from the beginning of his confinement, to conver&s;e and pray with him. It appeared that he had been early indoctrinated in the principles of Chri&s;tianity, though many of its truths were much effaced by a long cour&s;e of vice.</P>
<P>SOON after his condemnation, he appeared deep|ly convinced of guilt in the &s;ight of God, and the terrors of future mi&s;ery hung upon him. He was led to &s;ee a heart, as well as life, full of &s;in and rebellion again&s;t God; and that he might in per|fect ju&s;tice be forever ca&s;t off.&mdash;After this his mind was &s;trongly affected with a &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s of God, in giving a Saviour for the &s;alvation of penitents; and to him&s;elf in particular, for &s;paring him &s;o long while he had lived without prayer and in the practice of &s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="032888_0020_0FF5C70B5C035B30">
HIS hope of his own &s;alvation was very gradu|ally formed, and in the la&s;t part of his life appear|ed to be very &s;trong.</P>
<P>HE uniformly &s;poke of him&s;elf, as a creature guilty and ju&s;tly condemned, and that nothing but infinite mercy through the blood of Chri&s;t, could &s;ave him; and appeared &s;trong in a belief that he did rely on this mercy, and approve the character and law of God.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction, which men often make between little and great &s;ins, appeared to him improper; and he often &s;aid, that among all his &s;ins of heart and life, he never had committed one that was &s;mall, when con&s;idered as again&s;t an infinite God. His conduct was very decent and proper thro' the day of execution. In going to the place of death, he &s;aid that he felt him&s;elf &s;trangely &s;trengthened both in body and mind, and a&s;cribed all to the goodne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>AFTER having on the &s;caffold confe&s;&s;ed his irre|ligious life, warned the &s;pectators again&s;t tho&s;e vi|ces which ruined him, and declared him&s;elf free from any murderous intentions again&s;t M'Iver, the &s;entence was executed.</P>
<P>HE committed the names of his connexions in Great-Britain, to the Rev. NATHAN STRONG and Rev. ABEL FLINT, Mini&s;ters of the Pre&s;byterian Churches in Hartford, to whom any who are in|tere&s;ted in making an inquiry concerning him may apply.</P>
