<Q><BIBL><HI>2 CHRON. XX.11, 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Behold I &s;ay how they reward us, to come to ca&s;t us out of thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which thou ha&s;t given us to inherit. O our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might again&s;t this great Company that cometh again&s;t us; neither know we what to do; but our eyes are upon Thee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN we are called to enter upon any thing that is very arduous or difficult, it is commonly of no &s;mall advantage to con&s;ult the lives of the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> and carefully ob&s;erve how <HI>they</HI> conducted on &s;imilar occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>A variety of beautiful examples as well as ad|mirable rules for the regulation of our conduct in life, &s;o as to be ornaments to &s;ociety, and ble&s;&s;ings to our fellow creatures, are &s;cattered in the divine oracles.</P>
<P>Among the numerous <HI>examples</HI> of this kind, &s;carce any are either more lovely in them&s;elves, or more worthy of our ob&s;ervation, e&s;pecially at the pre&s;ent day, than tho&s;e wherein the &s;aint and the &s;oldier were united.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="014450_0004_0F925F7505CD7940" MS="y">A character like this &s;hines with a peculiarly charming lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>What can give us a more exalted idea of hu|man nature, than to &s;ee Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, David, and others of a like noblene&s;s of &s;oul going forth un|dauntedly again&s;t their enemies, with <HI>the word of God in their mouths,</HI> as well as <HI>a two-edged &s;word in their hands?</HI></P>
<P>One but little inferior&punc; to them, either as to holi|ne&s;s or heroi&s;m, is pre&s;ented us in our text, which is part of a conci&s;e or &s;hort prayer to heaven.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking to the words, I &s;hall by divine leave con&s;ider particularly, though very briefly, the character of the per&s;on who makes this pray|er;&mdash;the occa&s;ion upon which he prays;&mdash;and al&s;o the prayer it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The per&s;on, who thus &s;olemnly addre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf to heaven, is the excellent and renowned king Jeho&s;haphat.&mdash;A prince very rich, prudent and powerful, of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition and unble|mi&s;hed character.</P>
<P>The &s;acred Hi&s;torian ob&s;erves, that&punc; in the beginning of his reign, <HI>he &s;trengthened him&s;elf a|gain&s;t I&s;rael, and placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and &s;et garri&s;ons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim, which A&s;a his father had taken.</HI></P>
<P>This was acting a very prudent and commenda|ble part; but &s;en&s;ible however of this eternal truth, that <HI>there was no wi&s;dom or coun&s;el again&s;t the Lord;</HI> it is added, that <HI>he &s;ought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments: Therefore the Lord e&s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Joho&s;haphat pre|&s;ents, and he had riches in abundance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014450_0005_0F925F7542C83820">He now &s;ets upon the very pinacle of honour, in a &s;ituation extremely critical. For in honor of preferment, there is &s;omething intoxicating, which is commonly too much for weak heads.</P>
<P>But how is it with Jeho&s;haphat? How does he behave him&s;elf in this exalted &s;tation, and un|der the riche&s;t &s;miles of pro&s;perity?</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid, that hereupon <HI>his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Little contracted &s;ouls would have been lifted up with pride; but the noble Prince was of too generous and exalted a make to be guilty of &s;u|percilious haughtine&s;s. <HI>His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.</HI> A &s;ublime elation of &s;pirit this!</P>
<P>Jeho&s;haphat's <HI>plea&s;antne&s;s</HI> and <HI>affability</HI> to his &s;oldiers, is al&s;o worthy of remark.</P>
<P>When <HI>they ro&s;e up early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderne&s;s of Tek<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">a to battle; as they went forth, he &s;tood and &s;aid, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, believe in the Lord your God, &s;o &s;hall ye &s;tand; believe his prophets, &s;o &s;hall ye pro&s;per.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when he had con&s;ulted with the people, he appointed &s;ingers unto the Lord, that &s;hould prai&s;e the beauty of holine&s;s&punc; as they went out before the Army, and to &s;ay, Prai&s;e the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever.</HI></P>
<P>Such an apparent tenderne&s;s toward his men, accompanied with profe&s;&s;ed confidence in the divine protection&punc; was doubtle&s;s of very happy con&s;e|quence, filling them with great love and re&s;pect to their generous commander, and rai&s;ing their &s;pirits to a &s;ublime pitch.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="014450_0006_0F925F7600334CD0">How beautiful to &s;ee intrepidity, without ra&s;h|ne&s;s or pride? Courage guided by coun&s;el and wi&s;dom, and an air of dignity &s;oftened by gentlene&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of behaviour! But I can recollect &s;carce any thing recorded of this good king that does him more honor than the <HI>prayer</HI> in our <HI>text;</HI> the occa&s;ion whereof was this&mdash;A very nu|merous ho&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of the inhabitants of Am|mon, Moab and Mount Seir, had come up again&s;t him, and invaded his dominions.</P>
<P>Upon receiving intelligence of which, <HI>Jeho&s;ha|phat &s;et him&s;elf to &s;eek the Lord, and proclaimed a Fa&s;t throughout all Judah: And Judah gathered them&s;elves together to a&s;k help of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Jeho&s;haphat &s;tood in the congregation of Judah and Jeru&s;alem, in the hou&s;e of the Lord, be|fore the new Court.</HI></P>
<P>When I figure to my&s;elf the pious and amiable Monarch, &s;tanding on the <HI>brazen Scaffold</HI> which Solomon had erected for <HI>that purpo&s;e,</HI> and in the mid&s;t of a very numerous a&s;&s;embly, &s;preading forth his hands, and &s;olemnly addre&s;&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate, in behalf of him&s;elf and his be|loved people, I confe&s;s I am <HI>&s;truck with admira|tion.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, on <HI>one</HI> &s;ide, the young, the delicate and fair, &s;inking under di&s;tre&s;s and fear at the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> alarm; on <HI>another</HI> &s;tand the venerable Judges and Elders of I&s;rael, who&s;e heads were whitened with age.</P>
<P>On <HI>one</HI> &s;ide are fathers anxious for the &s;afety of their dear families and country; on <HI>another,</HI> tender afflicted mothers, with their little children.</P>
<P><HI>Here,</HI> with countenances <HI>&s;edate,</HI> &s;tand rows of &s;tate&s;men and politicians; <HI>there,</HI> a numerous
<PB N="9" REF="014450_0007_0F925F7A641FAA58">
throng of brave and gallant &s;oldiers: <HI>All</HI> in <HI>deep|e&s;t &s;ilence,</HI> and with their eyes <HI>fixed</HI> on their greatly beloved and much re&s;pected <HI>Prince,</HI> li&s;ten|ing to hear him begin his &s;olemn addre&s;s to heaven.</P>
<P>Whereupon, with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity, he at length breaks forth in the&s;e pertinent and moving expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in Heaven? And rule&s;t not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? And in thine hand is there not power and might, &s;o that none is able to with&s;tand thee?</HI></P>
<P>How lovely to &s;ee a <HI>Prince</HI> earne&s;tly <HI>interceed|ing</HI> at the throne of grace for his <HI>people,</HI> and the people all joining in the interce&s;&s;ion, no le&s;s anxi|ous for the pre&s;ervation of their prince!</P>
<P>The mo&s;t noble king Jeho&s;haphat, upon &s;ome <HI>&s;pecial</HI> occa&s;ions, did not di&s;dain or refu&s;e to offi|ciate as <HI>Chaplain.</HI></P>
<P>Far from thinking this beneath his dignity (as too many others have done who were unworthy to loo&s;e the latchet of his &s;hoes) he rather accounts it a great honour and privilege, that he who feels him&s;elf to be but du&s;t, is permited to &s;peak to the &s;upreme, infinite Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>But I now proceed to a particular con&s;ideration of Jeho&s;haphat's <HI>prayer,</HI> more e&s;pecially that part of it which our <HI>text</HI> contains; wherein the&s;e <HI>four</HI> things are very ob&s;ervable:</P>
<P>He pleads the goodne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s of his <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> appeals to God to judge between him and his enemies, acknowledges his utter <HI>inability</HI> without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either to conquer or with|&s;tand them, and profe&s;&s;es to repo&s;e an entire tru&s;t and confidence in God.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014450_0008_0F925F7A98A6F578">Fir&s;t, He pleads the goodne&s;s and righteou&s;|ne&s;s of his <HI>cau&s;e. Behold, I &s;ay, how they reward us, to come to ca&s;t us out of thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which thou ha&s;t given us to inherit.</HI> In the preceeding ver&s;e, he intimates that his people had always behaved <HI>inoffen&s;ive</HI> toward the&s;e invaders; never giving them any occa&s;ion thus to commence ho&s;tilities. And now behold, &s;ays he, <HI>the children of Ammon, and Moab, and Mount Seir, whom thou woulde&s;t not let I&s;rael invade, when they came out of the land of Epypt; but they turned from them and de|&s;troyed them</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es in the &s;econd chapter of Deuteronomy relates that God had forbidden I&s;rael to de&s;troy or di&s;tre&s;s the&s;e nations, commanding them to live peaceably by them as neighbours and brethren.</P>
<P>This prohibition or command, they had care|fully and religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved; in&s;omuch that when the haughty Kings of the&s;e nations refu&s;ed to grant them leave to march through their terri|tories into the land of Canaan, in&s;tead of making them feel the bitter effects of their re&s;entment, they turned from them and went to their promi&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion another way.</P>
<P>And now what vile returns are made by the children of Ammon, Moab, and Edom, for this indulgence? Living nigh, they knew full well what wonders God had wrought for I&s;rael; how he had de&s;troyed the heathen before them, and gi|ven them the land of Canaan for their inheritance.</P>
<P>They could not fail of knowing likewi&s;e, that unle&s;s propitious Heaven had forbid, <HI>they them|&s;elves,</HI> no le&s;s than the nations round about them, would have been de&s;troyed by I&s;rael's conquering &s;word.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="014450_0009_0F925F7C4192D500">Their very <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> was, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to <HI>this,</HI> that the hearts of this victorious people were &s;oftened and drawn out in benevo|lence toward them, &s;o as to let them live quietly by their very borders, while they cru&s;hed and ut|terly extirpated others.</P>
<P>Why therefore this <HI>inva&s;ion?</HI> What an <HI>unpro|voked</HI> injury are the invaders guilty of?</P>
<P>Who gave them the licence to &s;eize the land of I&s;rael, or endeavour to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s this highly &s;a|voured people of the inheritance which their God had bequeathed them? Or who <HI>provoked</HI> them thus to over-leap their own boundaries?</P>
<P>Jeho&s;haphat and his people &s;tood in a <HI>good</HI> cau&s;e; in the ju&s;t defence of every thing that was dear and &s;acred, while their <HI>enemies</HI> acted the part of bloody villains and robbers.</P>
<P>And by the way, 'tis of the la&s;t importance that when engaged in matters of great con&s;equence, we be thoroughly convinced that our cau&s;e is <HI>ju&s;t</HI>; &s;o fully convinced of this that we may with humble boldne&s;s bring it to the <HI>throne of grace,</HI> and plead and vindicate it there.</P>
<P>This nece&s;&s;arily gives <HI>life</HI> and <HI>animation,</HI> amid&s;t difficulties and dangers; for though we &s;hould chance to die in defence of &s;uch a cau&s;e, allowing it to be &s;ufficiently <HI>important</HI> and <HI>prudently</HI> mana|ged, our lives would not be fooli&s;hly thrown away, but honorably laid down in obedience to a divine call.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, The good King Jeho&s;haphat ap|peals to God to judge between him and his ene|mies.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>O! our God, wilt thou not judge them?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="014450_0010_0F925F7CB92A23D8">As if he had &s;aid, is it con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>honour</HI> of thy wi&s;e and righteous government to &s;uffer &s;uch high handed inju&s;tice and wickedne&s;s to go off <HI>triumphant?</HI> while the&s;e avaricious and gra&s;p|ing nations, not content with their own plea&s;ant allotments, have without the lea&s;t provocation, confederated together in order to deprive us of this goodly land, of our privileges and every thing that is dear, can thy thunders <HI>&s;leep</HI>? can vengeance be <HI>inactive</HI>? With re&s;pect to the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of our <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> Lord, we humbly ap|peal to thee. Thou knowe&s;t that we are injured and unju&s;tly invaded. Self-pre&s;ervation is a law of thine, ingraven on our hearts, and written in thy word; a <HI>violation</HI> of which would be highly &s;in|ful. Therefore not only <HI>intere&s;t</HI> but our own <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> forbid us to <HI>relinqui&s;h</HI> this cau&s;e: And wilt Thou not plead and vindicate it, by putting our enemies to &s;hame and confu&s;ion?</P>
<P><HI>The judge of all the earth</HI> ever did and ever will <HI>do right;</HI> and whenever he &s;uffers a <HI>righteous</HI> cau&s;e to be <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> it is through the <HI>mi&s;management</HI> and <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> of tho&s;e who are <HI>concerned</HI> in it, and becau&s;e they will not &s;uitably implore his coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or walk agreeable to his rules and directions.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> thing noted as worthy of ob&s;ervation in this excellent <HI>prayer</HI> of Jeho&s;haphat, <HI>is,</HI> that he acknowledges his utter <HI>inability,</HI> without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either to conquer or with&s;tand his inva|ding foes.</P>
<P><HI>We have no might again&s;t this great company that cometh again&s;t us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014450_0011_0F925F7D782EB0C0">He does not &s;ay our own &s;trength is <HI>&s;mall</HI> and <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI>; but we have <HI>no</HI> might&mdash;Of <HI>our&s;elves</HI> we are <HI>nothing</HI> and can <HI>do nothing.</HI></P>
<P>And to the want of <HI>power</HI> be &s;ubjoins al&s;o his confe&s;&s;ion of their want of <HI>wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Neither know we what to do,</HI> &s;ays he.</P>
<P>Power and wi&s;dom are two mo&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> things, which they who <HI>lack</HI> are indeed very <HI>poorly</HI> equipt for <HI>war.</HI></P>
<P>But could Jeho&s;haphat with a <HI>good</HI> grace con|fe&s;s and plead <HI>his</HI> want of the&s;e?</P>
<P>The &s;acred, infallible hi&s;tory wherein his wor|thy deeds are recorded, mentions his having eleven hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and mighty men of valour (if I <HI>rightly</HI> enumerated them) <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of tho&s;e whom the king <HI>put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o there ob&s;erved that <HI>he wared great exceedingly, building ca&s;tles and cities of &s;tore in Judah; that the Phili&s;tines were tributary to him, and the Arabians brought him pre&s;ents.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis univer&s;ally confe&s;s'd that he was a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> prince, and had, no doubt, a number of choice and prudent <HI>councellors.</HI> How then could he &s;ay, <HI>we have no might and know not what to do?</HI></P>
<P>This indeed is no <HI>paradox.</HI></P>
<P>He very well knew, and piou&s;ly and wi&s;ely con&s;idered that though his walls were never &s;o lofty and impregnable, or his armies never &s;o nu|merous and brave, he mu&s;t quickly &s;ink and fall, unle&s;s favoured by <HI>divine</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all his <HI>&s;eeming</HI> might and prowe&s;s, he <HI>felt</HI> him&s;elf to be a weak and feeble creature, entirely <HI>dependant</HI> upon God for protec|tion and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="014450_0012_0F925F7E359D1130">Very <HI>far</HI> from any of us be the impious thought that we can po&s;&s;ibly be under &s;uch advantageous circum&s;tances in our warlike engagements as <HI>not</HI> to need the aids of Heaven.</P>

<P>But la&s;tly, the pious king Jeho&s;haphat, in his prayer, profe&s;&s;es to repo&s;e an entire tru&s;t and con|fidence in <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our eyes,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>are upon thee.</HI></P>
