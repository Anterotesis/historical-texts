<Q><BIBL><HI>2 CHRON. XV. 1, 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the &s;pirit of God came upon Azariah, the &s;on of Oded. And he went out to meet A&s;a, and &s;aid unto him, Hear ye me, A&s;a, and all Judah and Ben|jamin, The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye &s;eek him, he will be found of you; but if ye for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you.</P></Q>

<P>_THE Occa&s;ion of this divine Me&s;&s;age to King <HI>A&s;a,</HI> and his Army, was the compleat victory, which, thro' help of God, and in an&s;wer to humble, believing prayer, they had very lately obtained over the huge and formidable Army of <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> who had invaded their Territories.&mdash;<HI>A&s;a,</HI> as a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>martial</HI> Prince, led forth his Army to put a &s;top to their progre&s;s, and &s;et the battle in array: and, as a <HI>godly</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> prince, &s;ought to God for help and &s;ucce&s;s. He led them
<PB N="2" REF="008586_0005_102F89DA1BDFD188">
into the field of battle to <HI>fight</HI>; before the bat|tle, he led them to the throne of Grace to <HI>pray,</HI> to obtain mercy, and find grace to help them, in this time of need and danger. He lift up a <HI>cry</HI> to God, e're he gave the <HI>&s;hout</HI> for the battle:&mdash; That battle, that work is begun well, and like to &s;ucceed well, which is pre|faced with holy, humble prayer. &mdash; <HI>A&s;a cried unto the Lord his God:</HI> It was a cry of Faith, rather than of Fear. His prayer was &s;hort, but fervent; a Prayer of Faith, effectual and pre|valent: it entred into the ears of the Lord of <HI>Sabaoth,</HI> found a gracious acceptance, and ob|tained divine help. God fought for them; and by them; gave their Enemies a total Overthrow. &mdash; Thro' faith and prayer, out of weakne&s;s, they were made &s;trong, waxed vali|ant in fight, and put to flight this va&s;t Army of Aliens.</P>
<P>Something &s;imilar have been the exerci&s;e, the practice, and the experience of the people of God in the&s;e <HI>Briti&s;h American Provinces and Colonies.</HI> &mdash; Envious and ambitious enemies made encroachments upon our King's territo|ries, and erected &s;everal &s;trong Forts in them, to enable them to keep what they had got, and to win more. To oppo&s;e their further pro|gre&s;s, and to drive them off from their unju&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, we mu&s;tered, and &s;ent forth our Forces; and our gracious Sovereign, pitying us, &s;ent brave Troops to a&s;&s;i&s;t us; but we, not

tru&s;ting to an arm of fle&s;h, not to our numbers nor &s;trength, not to our Sword nor Bow, like godly <HI>A&s;a,</HI> cried to the Lord our God; we fa&s;ted and wept, and made &s;upplication to him; and, ble&s;&s;ed be God, he turned not away our prayer nor his mercy from us; but has main|tained our right, and given us a &s;eries of &s;ignal Succe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>King <HI>A&s;a,</HI> and his victorious army were now returning in triumph, from the field of battle, to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> laden and enrich'd with the &s;poils of their enemies: doubtle&s;s greatly affected with the goodne&s;s of God, for the victory they had won: their tho'ts might be much employed as to the advantages, they &s;hould make of it, to the kingdom. Perhaps they might al&s;o be too much di&s;po&s;ed to ap|plaud them&s;elves and one another, for their &s;kill, and bravery, and &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;o take to them&s;elves that glory, which was due to God: however the&s;e things were, God &s;ent a pro|phet to meet them, and to deliver them a me&s;&s;age from him.</P>
<P>The <HI>manner</HI> of the prophet's addre&s;s was plain, and earne&s;t, and authoritative: he u&s;ed no pompous titles of honour, no ful&s;ome com|pliments, no ceremonious congratulations, not flattering applau&s;es. He came upon a more important errand, and with a holy zeal and vehemency delivered it: nor did he in a mean
<PB N="4" REF="008586_0007_102F89E0CD7D8978">
&s;ervile manner, beg leave to &s;peak, or favour to be heard: but, coming in the name of God, and with a Me&s;&s;age from him, he demanded their reverent attention: <HI>Hear ye me, A&s;a, and all Judah and Benjamin.</HI>&mdash; When God &s;peaks by the Mouth of a prophet, it becomes the greate&s;t men, the highe&s;t in Dignity and Power, to attend with the deepe&s;t humility and reve|rence, to hear what God the Lord has to &s;ay unto them: con&s;idering that, how high &s;o|ever they are above other men, they are infi|nitely more beneath the mo&s;t high God: nor &s;hould they take it in di&s;dain, if God's prophet, at &s;uch a time, give them not tho&s;e honorary titles, which other men do.</P>
<P>The <HI>me&s;&s;age</HI> was partly <HI>monitory</HI> to them of their duty and intere&s;t: <HI>The Lord is with you, while ye are with him, and if ye &s;eek him, he will be found of you:</HI> and partly <HI>minatory; but if ye for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you:</HI> and partly <HI>me|morative,</HI> to call afre&s;h to their minds, that, be|fore the battle, they were with God, in hum|ble fervent prayer, and in the battle God was with them by his providence and power: be|fore the battle they &s;ought God, in the battle God was a pre&s;ent help: they prayed, God heard; they believed, and were e&s;tabli&s;hed, were pro&s;pered: the victory they had gained, was owing more to God's pre&s;ence and ble&s;|&s;ing, than to their prowe&s;s and &s;words.&mdash;From the experience they had had of God's being
<PB N="5" REF="008586_0008_102F89E467EAE710">
with them, in the way of mercy and help, while they were with him, in the way of duty and tru&s;t, he &s;hewed them what their duty and intere&s;t &s;till were, even &s;till to be with God, and he will &s;till be with them.&mdash; Their enemies were wor&s;ted, either fled or de&s;troy|ed: <HI>there was no more war in the land:</HI> yet &s;till they needed the divine pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing, to direct their <HI>national affairs,</HI> and to pro&s;per their public Concerns: he let them know, that the Continuance of God's <HI>gracious pre&s;ence</HI> with them, depended upon their <HI>dutiful pre|&s;ence</HI> with him: and a&s;&s;ured them from God, that &s;o long as they &s;hould be with God, God would be with them; but withal a&s;&s;ured them, that if they for&s;ook God, God would in like manner, for&s;ake them. As they behaved to|wards God, in re&s;pect of duty and obedience, God&punc; would deal with them, in re&s;pect of the ways of providence.</P>
<P>This divine Me&s;&s;age, I humbly conceive, is &s;ea&s;onable, and in&s;tructive to us, in our cir|cum&s;tances, as it was to them, in their's.</P>
<P>The experience, which we, the Lord's peo|ple, in this land, have had, of the happine&s;s of engaging and enjoying the pre&s;ence of God with our Armies, &s;hould make us careful not to forfeit it by any &s;inful departure from God; and con&s;cientious in our abiding with God, that he may &s;till abide with us. Still we have
<PB N="6" REF="008586_0009_102F89E60A3CE920">
need of the divine pre&s;ence and help: we have not yet put off the harne&s;s, nor has our land re&s;t from war. Again our Troops are gone forth, and we may expect to hear of garments roll'd in blood. The pre&s;ence of God is as nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ucce&s;s of our Arms <HI>this</HI> Year, as it was the <HI>la&s;t:</HI> and if God go forth with our Armies, they will be pro&s;|pered.</P>
<P>As to the expert, the indefatigable, the mag|nanimous <HI>General,</HI> who led on his valiant Army to battle la&s;t year; and that under the greate&s;t di&s;advantages, and with the utmo&s;t difficulty and hazzard, but with an invincible re&s;olution and courage, and a &s;uperior conduct, again&s;t the va&s;tly greater Number of his enemies; and who quickly &s;cattered de&s;truction among them, put them to the rout, and cha&s;ed them before him: this &s;uper-eminent General, the glorious <HI>WOLFE,</HI> can be with us no more; he greatly fell in the la&s;t and conquering battle, and died in the bed of honour, fighting like an <HI>Hero,</HI> in the &s;ervice of his King, and in the defence of his &s;ubjects.&mdash;But tho' <HI>WOLFE,</HI> the dear, the brave, the bold, leader of his Troops, can no more &s;tand in the front of the battle, nor give his orders, nor by his words and example, fire their &s;pirits, and make them undaunted, amid&s;t the terrors and tumults of the fight; yet God lives, and &s;till we may have his favourable pre&s;ence; <HI>this</HI> is infinitely more, infinitely bet|ter:
<PB N="7" REF="008586_0010_102F89E8942C3710">
<HI>this</HI> made our &s;lain General, &s;uch an every way accompli&s;hed one: <HI>this</HI> can rai&s;e up, and give us other Generals, of equal &s;kill and con|duct, of equal zeal and fidelity, of equal forti|tude and &s;ucce&s;s. And if God be with our Troops, we may hope he will:&mdash; yea, ble&s;&s;ed be God, he has: tho' one is taken, another is left: a <HI>General</HI> who enjoyed the pre&s;ence of God with him, in the Reduction of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> the pride and tru&s;t of our enemies, a <HI>General,</HI> who&s;e very name &s;truck &s;uch terror into them, the la&s;t year, that they quickly abandoned their &s;trong Forts, at his approach, and betook them&s;elves to inglorious flight&mdash;<HI>AMHERST,</HI> the wary, the valiant, the victorious, is &s;till left unto us.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of God is equally nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial, for the Governour, as the Gene|ral; for the Court, as the Camp; for the field of hu&s;bandry, as the field of battle; in peace, as in war; and for the wi&s;e and &s;ucce&s;sful ma|nagement of affairs at home, as abroad: and our enjoyment of it turns upon our being with God.</P>
<P>There are two heads of di&s;cour&s;e before me; viz. 1. <HI>That the pre&s;ence of God with his people, is their only &s;afety and happine&s;s.</HI> 2. <HI>That their en|joying the pre&s;ence of God with them, depends upon their being with God.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="008586_0011_102F89EB5D6D18A8">I. <HI>The pre&s;ence of God with his People, is their only &s;afety and happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of God may be con&s;idered, as his <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> pre&s;ence: this is gene|ral and univer&s;al, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for up|holding in being, all creatures, in all worlds. In re&s;pect of this, God is the God of all the earth, and has the ab&s;olute ordering and di&s;po|&s;ing of all things, in the kingdoms of men, ac|cording to his own will, with &s;overeign domi|nion, and irre&s;i&s;tible power.&mdash;Or, as his <HI>glori|ous,</HI> and <HI>maje&s;tick</HI> pre&s;ence, which is peculiar to the heavenly world: there God dwells in the habitation of his holine&s;s, and &s;its upon the throne of his glory: Angels &s;tanding in his pre&s;ence, &amp; doing homage:&mdash;or, as his <HI>judicial, vindictive</HI> pre&s;ence, by which the damned in hell are puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction, from the glory of his power &mdash; or, as his <HI>&s;piritual, gracious</HI> pre&s;ence: which is peculiar to his church and &s;aints in this world: this accom|pli&s;hes for them, the everla&s;ting purpo&s;es of his grace and mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and ble&s;&s;es them with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, in heavenly things in him&mdash; or, as his <HI>&s;pecial providential</HI> pre&s;ence, which al&s;o is peculiar to his profe&s;&s;ing people: in re&s;pect of this, he is with them, &s;ometimes in <HI>judicial di&s;pen&s;ations,</HI> correcting them for, and recovering them from their de|generacies from him, and the ways of holine&s;s: and &s;ometimes in <HI>merciful di&s;pen&s;ations,</HI> pro&s;|pering
<PB N="9" REF="008586_0012_102F89ED2A103FE0">
them in their public concerns, and giv|ing them all outward ble&s;&s;ings richly to enjoy: health in their habitations, plenty in their &s;ub|&s;tance, peace in ther borders; and in ca&s;e of war, &s;ucce&s;s to their Arms.</P>
<P>This <HI>favourable providential pre&s;ence</HI> of God with his people, con&s;idered as a people, is <HI>that</HI> pre&s;ence of God, which the text more e&s;pe|cially, if not only, relates to. &mdash; This God vouch&s;afes to them, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, the great Mediator, thro' whom he comes nigh to them, and they are made nigh to him.</P>
<P>The &s;afety and peace, the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of God's people, depends wholly upon this pre&s;ence of God with them. This performs many great and di&s;tingui&s;hing acts of kindne&s;s and mercy for them: for where God is thus <HI>with</HI> his people, he is <HI>for</HI> them, e&s;pou&s;es their cau&s;e, con&s;ults their welfare, and promotes their happine&s;s. His right hand, and his arm, and the light of his countenance, do great things for them, becau&s;e he has a favour to them.</P>
<P><HI>This pre&s;ence</HI> of God with his people <HI>pre|&s;erves</HI> them in their greate&s;t &s;ufferings &amp; dan|gers: when like a <HI>bu&s;h on fire,</HI> flames threaten them with immediate de&s;truction, they are not con&s;umed: but according to the greatne&s;s of God's power and pity, he pre&s;erves them, when
<PB N="10" REF="008586_0013_102F89F122199188">
to them&s;elves they &s;eem appointed to peri&s;h. By this, the <HI>three Jewi&s;h Worthies</HI> were pre|&s;erved, in the mid&s;t of the burning fiery fur|nace; and <HI>Daniel</HI> in the lions den; in the mount the Lord is &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>This delivers</HI> them, in their lowe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;perate circum&s;tances. When they are &s;urrounded with difficulties and dangers, and reduced to the greate&s;t &s;treights: when they have neither wi&s;dom to contrive, nor power to effect, any way of e&s;cape, but, as to any vi&s;ible means, all hope of being &s;aved is gone; Now is God's times to work: <HI>Now will I ari&s;e,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>and &s;et them in &s;afety.</HI> Pro|vidence wonderfully &s;teps in, and opens a door of hope and help to them. So it did for <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in delivering them from <HI>Egyptian</HI> bon|dage: then God went forth for the &s;alvation of his people: yea, he rode upon his hor&s;es and chariots of &s;alvation, made &s;peed to help and &s;ave them.&mdash;Miraculous appearances and operations of providence, for the deliverance of God's oppre&s;&s;ed, endangered people, may not <HI>now</HI> be expected; yet God has very &s;trange and unthought of ways, to accompli&s;h delive|rance for them: as we &s;ee, in the deliverance of God's people, from their <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> captivity, and al&s;o in the days of <HI>E&s;ther.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This lays re&s;traint</HI> upon their envious and malicious enemies:&mdash;&s;ometimes <HI>upon their &s;pi|rits</HI>;
<PB N="11" REF="008586_0014_102F89F2B2E747D0">
tho' they envy them their enjoyments, and would fain deprive them of them, they cannot find an heart to do it. Thus tho' the enemies of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> coveted the good land, God had given them, yet when all the males went up to the fea&s;t of the Lord, to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and left their borders expo&s;ed to their incur&s;ions and depredations, God put &s;uch a re&s;traint up|on their &s;pirits, that no man then de&s;ired their land. <HI>When a man's,</HI> when a people's, <HI>ways plea&s;e the Lord, he maketh even their enemies to be at peace with them.</HI>&mdash; Sometimes <HI>upon their Tongues</HI>; that not &s;o much as a <HI>Dog</HI> &s;hall move his tongue again&s;t them: as <HI>Balaam,</HI> who loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, tho' hired with great rewards, could not cur&s;e <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &mdash; And &s;ometimes <HI>upon their Hands</HI>; tho' they &s;eem|ingly have them in their power, and are pro|voked enough to de&s;troy them, and have re|&s;olved to do it, yet their hands are, as it were, bound; they cannot execute their bloody purpo&s;es. So, when the &s;ons of <HI>Jacob,</HI> treache|rou&s;ly and cruelly murdered the <HI>Shechemites,</HI> the terror of God was upon the cities round about, that they &s;hould not pur&s;ue after them, nor avenge them&s;elves upon them.</P>
<P><HI>This defeats</HI> the mi&s;chievous plots and devi|ces of their enemies again&s;t them. When their enemies con&s;pire their ruin, and dig deep to hide their coun&s;els; and when they imagine, they have brought their matters to bear, and
<PB N="12" REF="008586_0015_102F89F46964AE00">
are confident of their &s;ucce&s;s, providence lays rubs in their way, and fru&s;trates their machi|nations: their deep-lay'd plots, and long la|boured Schemes prove abortive: and God's people e&s;cape, as a bird out of the &s;nare of the fowler. Thus <HI>Haman's</HI> plot for the de&s;truction of God's people, ended in di&s;appointment: and &s;o did the horrible, the helli&s;h <HI>Powder-Plot</HI> in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation, intended to blow up at once, and in a moment, the King and Parlia|ment: when it was ripened, and ju&s;t upon the point of execution, it was &s;trangely di&s;covered, and timou&s;ly prevented. &mdash; Yea, Providence often brings that mi&s;chief, upon the enemies of God's people, which they devi&s;ed and intended again&s;t them: they are &s;nared in the work of their own hands, and their de&s;igned mi&s;chief returns upon their own heads. &mdash; So <HI>Haman</HI> hand&s;ell'd the Gallows, he had prepared for <HI>Mordecai.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This &s;upplies</HI> them, with the comforts of life, &s;o that they want no good thing. This gives them <HI>Rain</HI> in due &s;ea&s;on and mea&s;ure: makes their fields, &s;uch as the Lord has ble&s;&s;ed, to yield their fruits in plenty; &s;o that their barns are filled with &s;ub&s;tance, their pre&s;&s;es bur&s;t out with new wine, and their garners are full, affording all manner of &s;tore; they have plen|ty, variety, dainties.&mdash;If at any time they &s;eem to be cut &s;hort, and fear want of bread, and cleanne&s;s of teeth, the good providence of God
<PB N="13" REF="008586_0016_102F89F76CD664C0">
finds out ways for their &s;upply, and prevents them with the ble&s;&s;ings of goodne&s;s. It was a wonderful work of God, for <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the wilderne&s;s, a land not &s;own, that for <HI>forty years</HI> together, they had &s;upplies brought them, from day to day.</P>
<P><HI>This directs</HI> them in all their darkne&s;s, and points out to them, the path of duty, the way of &s;afety. When in &s;ome critical conjunctures, they are wholly at a lo&s;s, and, like <HI>Jeho&s;haphat, know not what to do</HI>; when they are perplexed in their minds, and hem'd in on every &s;ide with difficulties and perils, and can &s;ee no way to &s;urmount, or e&s;cape them, providence, by &s;ome unexpected turns, opens a new &s;cene, and &s;hews them plainly the way, wherein they &s;hould go. God often gives his people di|rection, as to their pre&s;ent duty and &s;afety, by an uncommon coincidence of things in provi|dence; &s;o that who&s;o is wi&s;e, and ob&s;erves them, may under&s;tand the loving-kindne&s;s of the Lord. So God guided his people in the wilderne&s;s, and led them in a right way, in all their removes.</P>

breaks them with breach upon breach, till he brings them very low. But he means not to make a full end of them, but to renew them to repentance, and to recover them from their declen&s;ions. When therefore they repent, and turn to him that &s;mites them, he becomes to them a repairer of the breaches, and a re&s;torer of paths to dwell in: and builds them up, as he had pluckt them down. &mdash; Thus did he to his ancient people: he <HI>rai&s;ed up the tabernacle of David, that was fallen, and clo&s;ed up the breaches thereof, and rai&s;ed up the ruins thereof, and built them as in the days of old.</HI>&mdash;So did he by the great City, <HI>London,</HI> when, an <HI>hundred</HI> years ago, great part of it was laid in rubbi&s;h by devouring flames&mdash; So did he by this great Town, <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> when, near <HI>forty nine</HI> years &s;ince, this part of it, and the <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e,</HI> which &s;tood in this place, and the <HI>Town-Hou&s;e,</HI> and many other buildings along this &s;treet, on both &s;ides of it, were laid in a&s;hes.

<P>This brings me to the &s;econd Head of di&s;|cour&s;e, viz.

<P>All men, even they, who know not God, and are without God in the world, are yet with God, i. e. in his pre&s;ence, under his in|&s;pection, and the goverment of his providence. They are encompa&s;&s;ed with the divine im|men&s;ity, and <HI>in God they live, and move, and have their being.</HI> &mdash; But as God's pre&s;ence with his people &s;ignifies &s;omething more, than his e&s;&s;en|tial pre&s;ence, and univer&s;al providence, even his <HI>voluntary, cho&s;en,</HI> and <HI>gracious</HI> pre&s;ence, &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="008586_0022_102F8A0933212068">
their pre&s;ence with God, &s;ignifies &s;omething el&s;e, and &s;omething more, than this natural and nece&s;&s;ary pre&s;ence with him, even their <HI>volun|tary, cho&s;en,</HI> and <HI>dutiful</HI> pre&s;ence. Their pre|&s;ence with God mu&s;t corre&s;pond to his pre|&s;ence with them, be as a kind of counterpart to it; and an&s;wer to it, as the wax to the &s;eal.</P>
<P>As God's being with his people is his being for them, taking care of them, and di&s;pen&s;ing favours to them; &s;o their being with God, is their being <HI>for</HI> God, owning his cau&s;e, pur&s;uing his intere&s;t, doing his will, and advancing his glory. God's gracious providential pre&s;ence with them performs great acts of favour for them, and their obediential pre&s;ence with God, lies in performing religious duties to him.&mdash;It implies in it, <HI>their keeping covenant with God.</HI>&mdash; Their covenant relation to God con&s;titutes them his peculiar people: and brings them into a &s;tate of nearne&s;s to him; for they, that are &s;trangers from the covenant, are afar off from God: and their keeping covenant with God, being &s;tedfa&s;t in it, ab&s;taining from all &s;ins forbidden, and doing all required duties, be|lieving all revealed truths, and walking in all the commandments &amp; ordinances of the Lord; and in all de&s;igning his glory, is their being with God.&mdash;So al&s;o is <HI>their eying God in all pro|vidential di&s;pen&s;ations.</HI>&mdash; When they look thro' &s;econd cau&s;es, and above vi&s;ible in&s;truments, and &s;ee the &s;overeign providence of God in all

<P>God's people being thus with him, God will be with them. &mdash; Not as if their being with God <HI>merited</HI> his being with them. By no means: for after all, they are unprofitable &s;er|vants: and there are &s;o many &s;inful imper|fections attending them, in their abiding with God, &s;uch as, di&s;tru&s;t and impatience, carnal confidence and undue dependance upon them|&s;elves or others, or means, neglect of humble believing prayer, or of holy thankful prai&s;es, that God might ju&s;tly withdraw from them,

and deny them his gracious pre&s;ence. But, the&s;e infirmities notwith&s;tanding, his people may humbly hope for his pre&s;ence &amp; ble&s;&s;ing; for God is not &s;trict to mark iniquity, where he &s;ees &s;incerity.</P>
<P>This hope they may build upon the <HI>gracious promi&s;e of God:</HI> the text carries the empha&s;is of a promi&s;e in it: and God expre&s;ly promi&s;ed his people, that if <HI>they would walk in his &s;tatutes, and keep his commandments, and do them,</HI> i. e. if they would be with him, <HI>he would walk among them, and be their God:</HI> i. e. would be graci|ou&s;ly with them. This promi&s;e God has ever made good to his people: they ever found that, when they were with God in the way of duty, God was with them in the way of pro|vidential mercy: and God will not <HI>now</HI> &s;uffer his faithfulne&s;s to fail.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, <HI>the great concernment of God's glory &s;ecures his favourable pre&s;ence with them, while they are with him.</HI> Should God for&s;ake his peo|ple, while they keep near to him; &s;hould he deny them the ble&s;&s;ings, and load them with the judgments, of providence, while they are faithful in his covenant, and &s;tedfa&s;t, and un|moveable, and always abounding in works of obedience to him; the wicked world would take occa&s;ion to bla&s;pheme his name, as well as in&s;ult his people.

love to them, or care of them, or power to help them. Therefore, for the glory of his great name, he will not for&s;ake them, while they abide with him. God's glory is his &s;u|preme end; and the advancement of this is the great De&s;ign, he is carrying on in the world.</P>
