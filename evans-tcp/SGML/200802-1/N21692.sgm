<HEAD>How to pa&s;s the Balls through the Cups.</HEAD>
<P>You mu&s;t place your&s;elf at the farther end of the table, and then you mu&s;t provide your|&s;elf three cups, made of tin, and then you mu&s;t have your black &s;ticks of magic to &s;hew your wonders withal; then you mu&s;t pro|vide four &s;mall cork balls to play with; but do not let more than three of them be &s;een upon the table.</P>
<P>Note. Always conceal one ball in the right hand, between your middle finger and ring finger: and be &s;ure make your&s;elf per|fect to hold it there, for, by this means, all the tricks of the cups are done.</P>
<P>Then &s;ay as followeth.</P>
<Q><L>Gentlemen, three cups&mdash;'tis true</L>
<L>They are but tin, the rea&s;on why,</L>
<L>Silver is &s;omething dear,</L>
<L>I'll turn them in gold, if I live, &amp;c.</L>
<L>No equivocation at all:</L>
<L>But if your eyes are not as quick as my hands</L>
<L>I &s;hall deceive you all.</L>
<L>View them within,</L>
<L>View them all round about,</L>
<L>Where there is nothing in,</L>
<L>There's nothing can come out.</L></Q>
<P>Then take your four balls privately be|tween your fingers, and &s;o fling one of them upon the table, and &s;ay thus,
<Q><L>The fir&s;t trick that e'er I learn'd to do,</L>
<L>Was, out of one ball to make it into two</L>

<L>One of the&s;e two, I'll divide them into three,</L>
<L>Which is call'd the fir&s;t trick of dexterity.</L></Q></P>
<P>So then you have three balls on the table to play with, and one left between the fingers of your right hand.</P>

<P>And if you can perform the&s;e actions with the cups, you may change the balls into ap|ples, pears, or plumbs, or to living birds, to what your fancy leads you to. I would have given you more examples, but I think the&s;e are &s;ufficient for the ingenious, &s;o that, by the&s;e means, you may perform all manner of actions with the cups.</P>
<P>Note. The artificial cups cannot well be de&s;cribed by words, but you may have them of me, for they are accounted the greate&s;t &s;ecrets in this art: therefore, I advi&s;e you to keep them as &s;uch, for this was never known to the world before.</P>

<HEAD>How to &s;hew the wonderful <HI>Magic Lanthorn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This is the magic lanthorn that has made &s;o much wonder in the world, and that which Friar Bacon u&s;ed to &s;hew all his ma|gical wonders withal.</P>
<P>This lanthorn is called magic, with re|&s;pect to the formidable apparitions that by virtue of light it &s;hews upon the white wall of a dark room. The body of it is general|ly

made of tin, and of a &s;hape of the lamp; towards the back part, is a concave looking gla&s;s of metal, which may either be &s;phe|rical or parabolical, and which, by a grove made in the bottom of the lanthorn, may either be advanced nearer or put farther back from the lamp, in which is oil or &s;pi|rit of wine, and the match ought to be a little thick, that when it is lighted, it may ca&s;t a good light that may ea&s;ily reflect from the gla&s;s to the fore part of the lanthorn, where there is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e with the per&s;pective in it, compo&s;ed of two gla&s;&s;es that make the rays converge and magnify the object.</P>
<P>When you mean to make u&s;e of this ad|mirable machine, light the lamp, the light of which will be much augmented by the look|ing gla&s;s at a rea&s;onable di&s;tance. Between the fore part of the lanthorn, and the per|&s;pective gla&s;s, you have a trough, made on purpo&s;e, in which you are to run a long, flat thin frame with different figures, painted with tran&s;parent colours upon gla&s;s; then all the&s;e little figures pa&s;&s;ing &s;ucce&s;&s;ively before the per&s;pective gla&s;s, thro' which pa&s;&s;es the light of the lamp, will be painted, and repre|&s;ented with the &s;ame colours upon the wall of a darkroom, in a gigantic and mon&s;trous manner.</P>
<P>By this Lanthorn you may &s;hew what man, or woman, or birds, or bea&s;ts, and all &s;orts of fi&s;h that are in the &s;ea: &s;o if any gentleman

<P>This feat mu&s;t be performed by a look|ing-gla&s;s made on purpo&s;e, the figure where|of I have fully de&s;cribed, with the manner of making it, which is this; fir&s;t make a hoop, or phillet of wood, horn, or &s;uch like, about the width of a half crown piece in the circumference; the thickne&s;s of this hoop, or phillet, let it be about a quarter of an inch; in the middle of this hoop fa&s;ten a bottom of wood or bra&s;s, and bore in a de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt

<P>Take three parts of &s;alt-petre, two parts of &s;alt of tarter, and one part of &s;ulpher, pounded and mixed together, heat in a &s;poon &s;ixty grains of this compo&s;ition, and it will fly away with a fearful noi&s;e, like thunder, as loud as a cannon, breaking through the &s;poon and every thing underneath it, for it exerts it&s;elf downwards, contrary to the na|ture of gun-powder.</P>
