<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following &s;heets were principally com|piled by an anonymous per&s;on, &s;aid to be a lady, in IRELAND; from a &s;en&s;e of the great want of &s;omething of the kind in that country.</P>
<P>AS the work is in general executed with much &s;implicity and good &s;en&s;e, as well as piety, it may be no le&s;s u&s;eful on this &s;ide of the water: where, though we abound in &s;mall tracts for young per|&s;ons, we have none that come up to the idea here propo&s;ed, of making the Bible ea&s;y and intelligible to children; and &s;o as to guard them at the &s;ame time again&s;t the wrong conceptions and prejudices which they might otherwi&s;e imbibe from reading the hi&s;tories at length, of the Old Te&s;tament e&s;pe|cially, in a book of &s;uch a &s;ingular ca&s;t and &s;tile, and treating of matters &s;o much above their pre|&s;ent comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<Q><P>With regard to the method of teaching this book, &s;ays the author in a &s;hort preface to the work, that which I have experienced to be mo&s;t for the ea&s;e of the Ma&s;ter and Pupil, is the fol|lowing:</P>
<P>While the children are employed at any work, let the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s read to them one of the&s;e &s;tories by way of amu&s;ement, beginning with the fir&s;t; and it will naturally entertain and intere&s;t them. When each has repeated it again to the ma&s;ter, not in the words of the book, but in their own (retaining, however, all the &s;en&s;e) then read them the next &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="028888_0003_0FDE5754685C7560">
The que&s;tions and an&s;wers at the end of the chapters, are of too much importance to be pa&s;&s;ed over lightly; but they &s;hould not be taught by rote. If the children do not &s;pontaneou&s;ly a&s;k tho&s;e que&s;|tions them&s;elves, let the ma&s;ter fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;t, and then an&s;wer them. Let him occa&s;ionally repeat tho&s;e doubts to them, and he will judge by their an&s;wers, whether they have really imbibed their meaning or not; and if it appears they have not, he mu&s;t again read to them the an&s;wers as in the book, till they are perfectly fixed in their minds.</P>
<P>All this may be done in an ea&s;y good hu|moured way, as an indulgence, and not as a ta&s;k. A little every day will bring them on as fa&s;t as can be de&s;ired.</P></Q>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e it unnece&s;&s;ary to caution &s;uch ma&s;|ters, as are di&s;po&s;ed to ob&s;erve the foregoing di|rections, that they mu&s;t take care before they teach a new le&s;&s;on, to know whether the children remember the &s;ub&s;tance of all the preceding ones. This is very ea&s;ily done in the way of conver|&s;ation; and by trying whether they retain the titles of each chapter in their regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Although this compilation from the &s;criptures is mentioned as being chiefly de&s;igned for chil|dren, yet whoever knows the &s;tate of religious knowledge in this country, will ea&s;ily &s;ee, that tho&s;e of a riper age may find it a good a&s;&s;i&s;tant to lead them into ju&s;t and proper views of the re|vealed hi&s;tory of the dealings of Almighty God with mankind in the different ages of the world.</P>
<P>The alterations and improvements made in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is pre&s;umed, will &s;till better promote the original intent of the work.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GENESIS i. THE CREATION.</HEAD>
<P>WE find by the fir&s;t chapter of the book of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> which is the be|ginning of the Holy Bible, that God Al|mighty made the world in &s;ix days. He made the day and the night, the heaven above, the dry land and the &s;ea, the trees, and plants that grow upon the earth, the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, fi&s;h and fowl, and four footed bea&s;ts, and he al&s;o made the fir&s;t man. He formed him out of du&s;t, and called him <HI>Adam,</HI> and gave him power over every thing upon earth.</P>
<P>He commanded the &s;eventh day to be kept holy for ever, which is one of the rea|&s;ons why we go to church every <HI>Sunday,</HI> and make it a holy day.</P>

<HI>Que&s;.</HI> Who has the greate&s;t power?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> God. For he made every thing, he can do what he plea&s;es, and there is none can re&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who has the greate&s;t goodne&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God. For he gave us life, and all we have. He keeps us from all harm, and loves us as long as we endeavour to be like him in goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do we learn from the hi&s;tory of the creation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We &s;hould learn to prai&s;e God for having made birds, and bea&s;ts, and fi&s;h u&s;eful to us; and we &s;hould not u&s;e any of them cruelly, or give them unnece&s;&s;ary pain.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GENESIS ii. iii. THE FALL OF ADAM.</HEAD>
<P>GOD Almighty put <HI>Adam</HI> into a plea|&s;ant garden, called <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> or the garden of <HI>Eden;</HI> and God &s;aid, man &s;hould not be alone, he would make a companion for him&mdash;he did &s;o; and gave
<PB N="3" REF="028888_0006_0FDE57E349606FB8">
her to <HI>Adam</HI> to be his wife. <HI>Adam</HI> loved her exceedingly, and called her <HI>Eve.</HI></P>
<P>Our kind Creator, who is all goodne&s;s, and de&s;irous to make us happy, gave <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> every thing, except one tree which &s;tood in the middle of the garden. He forbade them to eat the fruit of that tree, and told them if they did eat of it, they &s;hould die.</P>
<P>They lived very happily in that garden for &s;ome time, and had nothing to trouble them while they were good and innocent. But evil thoughts and de&s;ires crept into the mind of Eve, and tempted her to eat what was forbidden; when &s;he had eaten of that forbidden fruit, &s;he de&s;ired her hu&s;|band to do the &s;ame, and he was per&s;uaded, though he knew that it was wrong, to eat &s;ome too. But when they had done eating they were a&s;hamed, and grew very unea&s;y, and went to hide them&s;elves behind the trees in the garden.&mdash;All people who have done wrong are troubled in mind, it is only good people that are happy within their own brea&s;ts, and plea&s;ed with the re&s;t of the world; becau&s;e they know they have done well, and that God loves them, and that every body &s;hould &s;peak well of them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028888_0007_0FDE575F565C49F8">
<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> thought in their fright to hide them&s;elves from God; but he knows every thing, and &s;ees every where, even into our thoughts. He called to them and a&s;ked them, why they had eaten the fruit which he had commanded them not to eat? <HI>Eve</HI> an&s;wered, that the Ser|pent, meaning her own evil inclination, had per&s;uaded her, and <HI>Adam</HI> &s;aid his wife had per&s;uaded him.&mdash;God is not to be put off with excu&s;es, what he commands, mu&s;t be minded. So he directly turned them out of that happy place, and &s;ent them to wander about in a wild country, overgrown with weeds and briars, where they could get nothing to eat but what they dug and ploughed, and laboured hard for. There they grew old, and &s;ickly, and died.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What &s;hould we do when we have done wrong.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Whenever we have done wrong, we &s;hould never make excu&s;es, or endeavour to hide our faults, for that is a kind of fal&s;ehood; but we &s;hould at once confe&s;s that we are to blame, be &s;orry for our fault, and endeavour to do &s;o no more, that we may be forgiven.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How far can God &s;ee?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="028888_0008_0FDE57EBE86483E0">
<HI>A.</HI> He can &s;ee every where, for he is not like us. He &s;ees and hears from one part of the world to the other, and for that rea|&s;on all wi&s;e people fear God more than man. It is impo&s;&s;ible to hide any thing from him; and as he loves us, he will al|ways puni&s;h us one way or other when we do ill, in order to make us grow better.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What el&s;e do we learn from this hi&s;|tory?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That we ought to be very careful not to do any thing that can be the lea&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ing to God, however trifling it may appear to us, as we cannot tell what evil may befal us in con&s;equence.

<P><HI>ADAM</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had two &s;ons, <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel; Cain</HI> was a hu&s;bandman, and <HI>Abel</HI> a &s;hepherd; <HI>Cain</HI> was ill-natured and ob|&s;tinate, but <HI>Abel</HI> was very mild, and obe|dient
<PB N="6" REF="028888_0009_0FDE57684A13AA88">
to God and his parents. God there|fore loved him better than <HI>Cain,</HI> and this made <HI>Cain</HI> jealous of his brother <HI>Abel,</HI> and made him hate that good young man&mdash;He had much better have &s;triven to have been like him, and then God would have loved him as well as he loved <HI>Abel.</HI> One day when the two brothers were abroad toge|ther in a field, <HI>Cain</HI> ro&s;e up again&s;t poor <HI>Abel</HI> and killed him. He thought they were alone, and that nobody would ever know it, but God is always pre&s;ent with us. He therefore was with <HI>Abel</HI> when he was &s;o cruelly murdered, and called out to <HI>Cain</HI> and told him that he knew it. <HI>Cain</HI> was then ready to &s;ink into the earth with fear, as well he might after &s;uch an action. God drove him away that moment, and put a frightful mark upon him, &s;o that every bo|dy who &s;aw him ran away. He was very unhappy all the re&s;t of his life, and at la&s;t he died.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Where is God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God is in Heaven. It is there he has promi&s;ed that good people &s;hall be af|ter death, where they will be happy for ever: but he is likewi&s;e every where at once. He is here now, and knows all we

<P><HI>Q.</HI> How was God made, and at what time?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He was never made, for he was be|fore all time. He made all things, both in heaven and earth, and was always as he is now. When we go to him after death, we &s;hall know him much better than we can do at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do we learn from the hi&s;tory of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may learn from the hi&s;tory of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> how wrong it is not to love one another, and whenever we are going to do any thing that is ill-natured, or to quarrel with one another, we &s;hould do well to remember, that by indulging the&s;e habits, <HI>Cain</HI> was tempted at la&s;t to murder his brother, and was driven away from his parents, into a &s;trange country.</P>

<P><HI>ADAM</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had another &s;on, be|&s;ides <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> called <HI>Seth,</HI> and al&s;o &s;everal other children.</P>
<P><HI>Cain</HI> too had a great many children, and tho&s;e children, when they grew up to be men and women had &s;everal children of their own, &s;o that the world became full of people. After the death of their fathers, the&s;e children grew very wicked, they were ill-natured and quarrel&s;ome, gave way to their pa&s;&s;ions, neglected to think of God, or to &s;ay their prayers; and God was &s;o offended with them, that he re&s;olved to de|&s;troy the whole world.</P>
<P>There was however among them one good man called <HI>Noah,</HI> and God took care he &s;hould not &s;uffer with the re&s;t. He therefore taught him how to make a kind of covered boat, of prodigious bigne&s;s, called an Ark, and bade him to go into it with all his family, and take with him all &s;orts of bea&s;ts and birds, and then to &s;hut him&s;elf up in it.</P>
<P>When he had done &s;o, God &s;ent &s;o much rain for forty days and nights, that the wa|ters

ro&s;e up to the tops of the hou&s;es and of the trees on the highe&s;t mountains, &s;o that the men, women, and children, were every one of them drowned. All this while <HI>Noah'</HI>s Ark floated &s;afely upon the waters, and no mi&s;chief befel him, for God was plea&s;ed with him. At la&s;t the Ark re&s;ted upon a high mountain, which is called <HI>Mount Ararat;</HI> and at the end of &s;even months the rain being gone, God &s;ent a &s;trong wind to dry the ground. <HI>Noah</HI> then opened a window and let out a raven; this is a bird that feeds upon dead bodies, and he found &s;o much to eat that he went back no more. After &s;even days <HI>Noah</HI> let out a dove, which is a bird like a pigeon, but it flew back to him very &s;oon, becau&s;e it could find no dry place to perch upon. In &s;even days more <HI>Noah</HI> let out the dove a|gain, and it came back with an olive branch in its bill. <HI>Noah</HI> knew by this that the waters were almo&s;t dried from off the earth, and when he let out the bird again, it came back to him no more. He &s;oon after ven|tured to open the door and go out with all his family. The fir&s;t thing they did was to kneel down and prai&s;e God, for having &s;aved them; good people always prai&s;e God for every thing, becau&s;e they know that all comes from him. God was &s;o plea&s;ed with &s;eeing <HI>Noah</HI> thankful, that he ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="10" REF="028888_0013_0FDE5771EDCBE850">
him, and bade him look up and &s;ee a rain|bow, which he told him was for a token, that the world never would be drowned again. <HI>Noah</HI> lived a great while after this with his wife, his three &s;ons, and their wives and children. When he grew very old and weak, he died in peace.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do we learn from the hi&s;tory of <HI>Noah</HI> and the flood?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We &s;hould learn to be good and to tru&s;t entirely in God.</P>
<P>Whenever you &s;ee a rainbow, remember it was the &s;ign which God gave of his for|giving mankind, and you &s;hould never look at it without thanking him in your mind for his goodne&s;s and his mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is dying?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is for the body to become &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;o as not to &s;tand, or to move, or &s;ee, or hear, or &s;peak, or feel&mdash;in &s;hort, dying is like going to &s;leep.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is there an end of men when they die?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; men are to live after death: they that have been good in this world, are to be rai&s;ed again, and to be taken into Heaven, and to be with God, where no|body can hurt them: where they will feel no pain, nor &s;orrow, nor &s;ickne&s;s, where they will be always good, and always glad and never die again.

might be delivered from the ignorance and wickedne&s;s, and doubts and fears, into which the greater part of them would fall; and would tell them how to live well and die comfortably, and to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a better life, and a better happine&s;s than they can have in this world, neither of which will ever have an end: and that thus, in <HI>Abraham</HI> and his family, all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After <HI>Abraham</HI> had been told this by God Almighty, he and his wife <HI>Sarah</HI> lived many years, till they were both grown old, and &s;till &s;he had no child: <HI>Abraham</HI> was very ea&s;y about this, for he knew that what God promi&s;es he always performs in his own good time; but <HI>Sarah</HI> being a &s;illy woman, fretted and &s;hewed great impa|tience. At la&s;t three angels came to him, and told him God remembered his promi&s;e, and <HI>Sarah</HI> &s;hould &s;oon bring him a &s;on. She was behind the door and heard them, but &s;he did not believe God's word, but laughed at what they &s;aid, though &s;he might have remembered that God Almighty can do what he plea&s;es. And he, from whom nothing is hid, cau&s;ed her to be a&s;ked why &s;he laughed? upon which &s;he began to be frightened, and &s;aid &s;he did not laugh. So &s;he was guilty of two great faults, the one
<PB N="17" REF="028888_0020_0FDE580CF6603638">
was telling a fal&s;ehood, the other was not believing God's power.</P>
<P>Soon after &s;he had a &s;on, and he was called <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> When he was grown a great boy, and his father was very fond of him, and very thankful to God for his goodne&s;s in having be&s;towed him, God Almighty had a mind to &s;hew the world that <HI>Abra|ham</HI> tru&s;ted him as much as he ought, and believed in the promi&s;es of God (that his de&s;cendants &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the land of <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> and that of his family by <HI>I&s;aac, Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould be born) God therefore bade him take his &s;on up to a high mountain, and there &s;acrifice him; that is, kill him in a certain manner, and burn his dead body. <HI>Abraham</HI> knew that what Almighty God has promi&s;ed he always performs, and that he never requires any thing which it is not right and be&s;t for us to do: they who love God as much as his goodne&s;s to us de&s;erves, &s;hould be willing to give up their life, or any thing el&s;e to him when he calls for it; and although <HI>Abraham</HI> loved his &s;on much, he loved God better, and was always ready to do whatever would plea&s;e him. So with out &s;aying one word, tho' grieved to the heart, he directly took his &s;on with him to the mountain, and was ju&s;t going to &s;acri|fice him, when God called out to him not to do it, for that he only meant to try him
<PB N="18" REF="028888_0021_0FDE5785A03DE418">
for an example to others. He then came down from the mountain again very joy|fully with his &s;on, and God told <HI>Abraham,</HI> that &s;ince he had been &s;o ready to obey him, he &s;hould &s;ee his &s;on married, and have children; and that he would ble&s;s him in many ways. As for <HI>Sarah,</HI> God Almighty did not think fit that &s;he &s;hould live to &s;ee her &s;on married; but after her death, <HI>Abraham</HI> began to think of a wife for <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> He did not like any of the women of that country, becau&s;e they were not well behaved; &s;o he &s;ent an old faithful &s;ervant into his own country among his cou&s;ins, to get a wife for his &s;on. When the &s;ervant came near the city of <HI>Nachor</HI> in <HI>Me&s;opota|mia,</HI> he &s;topped at a well, and kneeled down to pray for God's ble&s;&s;ing, for he knew no|thing could be done without that. And he prayed to God Almighty, to &s;end to the well the woman he cho&s;e for his ma&s;ter's &s;on <HI>I&s;aac;</HI> and that when he a&s;ked her to draw water for him, &s;he might an&s;wer, I will give you water and to your camels too; by which he &s;hould know, that was the wo|man God had &s;ent. God Almighty, though he does not always grant us the particular favours that we a&s;k, becau&s;e in our igno|rance we often a&s;k for what would hurt our&s;elves or others, yet thought proper to hear this prayer of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s &s;ervant, for

&s;oon after <HI>Rebekah,</HI> the cou&s;in of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> came. He a&s;ked her for water, and &s;he &s;aid, I will give you water, and to your ca|mels too. Then he thanked God that he had found the woman he wanted, and he went with her home to her father's, and a&s;ked his con&s;ent to the marriage. The father con&s;ented, and &s;o did &s;he; after a few days he brought her to the land of <HI>Ca|naan;</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aw her married to <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and &s;he made him a very good wife.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham</HI> lived after that &s;ome time, and continued with all his hou&s;ehold to &s;et an excellent example of wor&s;hipping and &s;erv|ing the only true God; for which he is honoured with being called the friend of God, and will be rewarded by him in an|other world.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What &s;hould we learn from the hi&s;|tory of <HI>Abraham?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Always to obey the will of God, how|ever di&s;agreeable it may &s;eem to us; and always to bear afflictions and di&s;appoint|ments with patience.

<P>When <HI>Rebekah</HI> heard that, &s;he advi&s;ed <HI>Jacob</HI> to go away, for fear <HI>E&s;au</HI> &s;hould be tempted to do like <HI>Cain,</HI> that murdered his brother. <HI>I&s;aac</HI> gave <HI>Jacob</HI> leave to go, and de&s;ired he would take a wife among his own relations, as he him&s;elf had done.

<P><HI>Jacob</HI> travelled on till it was dark, then he lay down in a field, and &s;et his head upon a &s;tone for a pillow, and fell a&s;leep. He dreamed that he &s;aw a great ladder, the top of it reaching to the heavens, and the angels of God a&s;cending and de&s;cend|ing, that is, going up and down. He dreamed al&s;o that God Almighty called to him from the top of it, and told him he was the God of <HI>Abraham</HI> and of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and that he would ble&s;s him too, and he &s;hould have &s;o many children, that they and their children &s;hould be like the &s;tars in the heavens, or like grains of &s;and for num|ber,

and that the promi&s;es made to <HI>Abra|ham</HI> &s;hould be fulfilled in his family.</P>
<P>The next morning after <HI>Jacob</HI> had pray|ed to God, as every body ought to do night and morning, he went on his jour|ney till he came to the well, where <HI>Abra|ham'</HI>s &s;ervant met his mother <HI>Rebekah.</HI> Soon after he had &s;topped there, he &s;aw a girl called <HI>Rachel, Rebekah'</HI>s brother <HI>La|ban'</HI>s daughter, coming with a pitcher to draw water: <HI>Jacob,</HI> who was a very civil young man, ran and drew the water for her: then he told her he was her cou&s;in, and went home with her to <HI>Laban</HI> his un|cle. <HI>Laban</HI> was very glad to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Rebekah'</HI>s &s;on, and de&s;ired <HI>Jacob</HI> to &s;tay and live with him.

<HI>Rachel</HI> too. As for <HI>Jacob,</HI> he was &s;o de|&s;irous to marry <HI>Rachel,</HI> that he con&s;ented to any terms; and he got her for &s;even years' &s;ervice more. <HI>Jacob</HI> lived a long while with his father-in-law <HI>Laban,</HI> and was &s;o careful, that God pro&s;pered every thing he undertook.

<P>When they had gone a part of the way, &s;ome of his &s;ervants who went on before, came running back to him, and told him

There were in the &s;ame pri&s;on two other pri&s;oners; the chief baker of king <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and his chief butler, whom they called his cup-bearer. The chief baker dreamed he had three ba&s;kets upon his head, full of baked meats for the king's table, and that the birds of the air came and devoured them. As for the butler, he dreamed that he held three branches of a vine-tree in his hand, that they were full of grapes, and that he &s;queezed them into a cup, for wine to &s;erve up at the king's table. They were both very unea&s;y to know what the&s;e dreams could mean&punc; and <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;aw by their countenances that they were troubled; he a&s;ked them what ailed them, and they told him what &s;trange

dreams they had dreamed, and that they wi&s;hed to know the meaning of them.</P>
<P>Dreams very &s;eldom have any meaning at all, and it is fooli&s;h to be concerned about them; for when people &s;leep badly, their heads are di&s;turbed, and rambling thoughts pa&s;s through their minds. But as for the&s;e two dreams, God Almighty directed them on purpo&s;e, for wi&s;e rea&s;ons of his own, as we &s;hall &s;ee by and by. He al&s;o put it into <HI>Jo&s;eph'</HI>s head to explain tho&s;e dreams to them. So he told the baker, that his dream &s;ignified that in three days <HI>Pharaoh</HI> would order him to be hanged; but as to the cup-bearer, he told him, he would, in three days, fill out wine to the king; and then he begged he would &s;peak for him, that he might be let out of pri&s;on. The cup-bearer promi&s;ed him fair; but when he got out on the third day, his joy made him &s;o ungrateful that he forgot poor <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who remained in pri&s;on two years longer.</P>
<P>At the end of that time God &s;ent a &s;trange dream to king <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> who want|ed to have it interpreted or explained, and none of the wife people of that country could under&s;tand it, becau&s;e God had not revealed, that is, had not made it known to them; for we know nothing but what God di&s;covers to us.</P>

So then the chief butler thought of <HI>Jo|&s;eph,</HI> and told the king of him; and the king &s;ent for him out of pri&s;on, and &s;aid to him, I hear that you can explain dreams. I have had a &s;trange one that I wi&s;h to know the meaning of. I thought I &s;aw &s;even fat oxen come out of a river, and &s;even lean ones come after them, who eat up the fat ones. Then <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> told him, that it was only by the power of God that dreams could be explained, and that the &s;even fat oxen meant &s;even years of great plenty, and after them would come &s;even years of famine, that is, the weather would be &s;o bad that the corn would be all &s;poil|ed, and there would be none to make bread of for &s;even years; and this was the meaning of the &s;even lean oxen that de|voured the fat ones. Then <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> advi&s;ed him, when the &s;even years of great plenty came, to build granaries or &s;tore-hou&s;es, and lay up a great deal of corn in them, &s;o that, in the time of famine, the king might &s;ell the corn to the people for mo|ney, and they would have bread enough. When the king found that God had made <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;o wi&s;e, he &s;et him over every body, and commanded all the people to obey him. <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who was then become a great man, took care in the &s;even years of plenty, to build granaries, and provide corn

&s;ufficient to feed the people when the fa|mine came; and the king had &s;uch de|pendence on him, that when any per&s;ons came to him, he &s;ent them all to <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> The famine was all over <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> where old <HI>Jacob</HI> lived. He was told there was bread in <HI>Egypt,</HI> but little thought his &s;on <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> had the di&s;po&s;ing of it. However, he &s;ent all his other &s;ons, except <HI>Benjamin,</HI> into <HI>Egypt,</HI> with money to buy corn for bread. When they were brought before <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> they bowed them|&s;elves down before him, with their faces to the earth; they did not know him, but he knew them, and he a&s;ked them if their fa|ther was alive, and if they had any more brothers. They told him they never had but two more; one called <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who had been devoured by wild bea&s;ts, and the other, called <HI>Benjamin,</HI> was at home with their father. Then <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> ordered their &s;acks to be filled with corn, and bade his &s;ervants put in the money too, which they had brought to pay for it. When they in|tended going away, he put them into con|finement for three days; and when he re|lea&s;ed them, he told them, that when they wanted more they mu&s;t bring <HI>Benjamin</HI> with them, or they &s;hould have none; and he kept <HI>Simeon,</HI> one of their brothers, to make &s;ure of their coming back. They were all
<PB N="35" REF="028888_0038_0FDE583C29F1FDC8">
much affrighted at this, and they &s;aid one to another, We are verily guilty concern|ing our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, when he be&s;ought us, and we would not hear; therefore behold al&s;o his blood is required. Thus we &s;ee&punc; when bad men meet with any misfortune, their con&s;ciences always accu&s;e them, and their &s;ufferings are much harder to bear, when they con&s;ider that they have de&s;erved them by their wickedne&s;s. When they went home, and found the money with the corn in their &s;acks, they were both &s;urprized and afraid. <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aid, that might be a mi&s;take of the &s;ervants, but bade them remember to carry it back, when they went again; for an hone&s;t man would not cheat another, though he was &s;ure of being never found out; becau&s;e God &s;ees all we do, and never fails to puni&s;h us one time or other. At la&s;t, when all the corn was eaten up, <HI>Jacob</HI> de&s;ired his &s;ons to go and buy more. This made them very unea&s;y, for they dur&s;t not go without <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and they knew it would grieve <HI>Jacob</HI> to part with him. At la&s;t they ventured to put him in mind, that the great man who &s;old them the corn, &s;aid they &s;hould have no more unle&s;s <HI>Benjamin</HI> came with them. When poor <HI>Jacob</HI> heard this, he cried, and &s;aid, he was already deprived of two of his &s;ons, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and

<HI>Simeon,</HI> and if he lo&s;t <HI>Benjamin</HI> too, it would break his heart. Then <HI>Judah,</HI> the elde&s;t &s;on, begged he would not be unea&s;y, and promi&s;ed to take all the care he could of the boy, and all the other &s;aid the &s;ame. So <HI>Jacob</HI> gave them money to buy more wheat, and did not forget to &s;end back the other money that was the price of the corn they had bought before. He then &s;uffered <HI>Benjamin</HI> to go with them, and prayed earne&s;tly to God to ble&s;s them all.</P>
<P>When they came to <HI>Egypt,</HI> they were brought directly to <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who, when he &s;aw his brother <HI>Benjamin,</HI> his mother <HI>Ra|chel'</HI>s child, he was &s;o moved he could not help crying with joy, and turned away, that they &s;hould not &s;ee him. He then invited them to dinner, and put five times more meat upon <HI>Benjamin'</HI>s plate than upon the others, which they all wondered at. When they took leave, he privately or|dered his &s;ervants, after they had filled their &s;acks with corn, to put his &s;ilver cup into the mouth of <HI>Benjamin'</HI>s &s;ack. He al&s;o de&s;ired them to follow his brothers, and a&s;k them how they could be &s;o un|grateful to their ma&s;ter, who had been &s;o civil to them, and why they &s;tole his &s;ilver cup, and were carrying it away.

it was found among them, they were willing to go to pri&s;on. So all the &s;acks were opened, and it was found in <HI>Benjamin'</HI>s &s;ack. Poor <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who knew nothing of the matter, was very much a&s;hamed, and grieved when he &s;aw it; and the &s;ervants &s;aid, he mu&s;t go directly to pri&s;on. Then all his brothers went back with him to beg him off; for they were not wicked now, as they had been when they &s;old <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> but were grown very good, and had rather have gone to pri&s;on them&s;elves, than leave <HI>Benjamin</HI> behind; becau&s;e it would grieve their father to lo&s;e him. So they went back lamenting, and when they came to <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> they kneeled down before him; and <HI>Judah</HI> begged he would put him in pri&s;on in&s;tead of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and let the boy go back to his old father; but <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> ap|peared to be very angry, and &s;aid he would not let him go. This gave all the bro|thers the greate&s;t concern. Then <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was &s;o moved at finding they were peni|tent, that is, &s;orry for their pa&s;t fault, that he could hold out no longer, but threw his arms about their necks, and &s;aid, I am your brother <HI>Jo&s;eph:</HI> Doth my father yet live? Be ye not grieved, or angry with your|&s;elves, that ye &s;old me hither; for God, who orders every thing for the be&s;t, &s;ent me here before you to pre&s;erve life. Then

he de&s;ired them to go back to <HI>Canaan,</HI> and tell their father that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was alive, and in favor with God and man; and that he mu&s;t come down to <HI>Egypt,</HI> with his whole family, where they &s;hould all be taken care of.</P>

<P><PB N="40" REF="028888_0043_0FDE57CD25C5D0A8">
<HI>A.</HI> It is doing any thing that we believe to be wrong, and that God does not like, and he does not like any thing that can hurt our&s;elves or other people, or that &s;hews di&s;re&s;pect to him. He has com|manded us never to tell as lie, or do any &s;ort of mi&s;chief, to be very mode&s;t and civil, and to do every thing we are bid by tho&s;e who are &s;et over us, if it is not con|trary to the commands of God.

As God Almighty can never be at a lo&s;s how to puni&s;h perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate people, he &s;ent &s;uch a number of lice, that the very du&s;t &s;eemed to be all turned into lice, which crawled about them, and gave them no re&s;t.

Afterwards God &s;ent &s;uch &s;warms of flies, they looked at a di&s;tance like black clouds, and buzzed about them &s;o intolerably, they were not able to bear it. Upon which the king again de&s;ired <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to pray for him; <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> did, and immediately the flies were re|moved. But &s;till <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s heart was hardened, and he would not let the chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> go. So then God &s;ent a &s;ickne&s;s among the cattle, that they almo&s;t all died: and when that would not do, he &s;ent &s;uch &s;ickne&s;s among the people, that they were all covered with &s;ores and biles, and ulcers. After that he &s;ent &s;torms of hail which killed all tho&s;e it fell upon, beat down the roofs of the hou&s;es, and de&s;troyed all the buildings; yet &s;till <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s heart was hardened, and he would not let the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> go.

So then God &s;ent a &s;trong wind, that brought with it a number of locu&s;ts, which eat up all the fruits of the earth, and every thing that grows for the u&s;e of man and bea&s;t. But &s;till <HI>Pharaoh</HI> was only frighted for the time. God then &s;ent darkne&s;s all over that part of the land where the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were, but the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> had light at the &s;ame time; yet as &s;oon as the plague was gone, <HI>Pharaoh</HI> forgot the goodne&s;s of God in giving him relief; and al&s;o forgot the power of God to &s;end a wor&s;e plague, if he provoked him. Wick|ed people are always fooli&s;h. If he had had any &s;en&s;e at all, he would have con|&s;idered, that what God had done once he could do again, or a great deal wor&s;e, if he plea&s;ed, and that there is no e&s;caping him. At la&s;t, however, God Almighty obliged <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to &s;ubmit to him. He &s;ent an angel through the land, command|ing him to kill the fir&s;t-born, that is, the elde&s;t child in every family; except among the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> where none of the fir&s;t-born died. And God commanded <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to in&s;titute (that is, to appoint) a fa&s;t, which was to be ob&s;erved by the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> every year, in remem|brance of this event, and which was to be called the pa&s;&s;over; becau&s;e when the an|gel &s;lew the fir&s;t-born of the children of

the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were pa&s;&s;ed over, <HI>i. e.</HI> were pre&s;erved alive When <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had lo&s;t his own fir&s;t-born, he found God was not to be re&s;i&s;ted, and &s;o at la&s;t he let the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> go. And the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were &s;o glad of it, be|cau&s;e of the plagues God had &s;ent upon their account, that they let them have a great deal of gold and &s;ilver, and &s;everal ear-rings and bracelets to carry away. So they went away very rich; and as they travelled along, God went before them by day in a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire. At la&s;t they came to the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> but before they got there, <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s ob|&s;tinacy had got the better of his fears, and he repented that he had let them go. So he called together his army, and followed them. Then the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;aw nothing but the <HI>Red Sea</HI> before them, and the wicked king and his army behind them. They were &s;o terrified, they were ready to die with fear, for they forgot that the Al|mighty was their friend. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> prayed to God, and he immediately bade him &s;trike the &s;ea with his wand. When he had done &s;o, the waters divided on both &s;ides, and there was a path between for them to walk through.

<P>When the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;aw this they prai&s;ed God, and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> made a p&s;alm of thank&s;|giving, which they all &s;ung, and they danced and were very joyful.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here it will be proper to teach them that &s;ong, explaining all the words in it.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What may we learn from the &s;ad end of <HI>Pharaoh?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may learn that it is a very dread|ful thing to be of an ob&s;tinate proud tem|per; and that after the&s;e bad di&s;po&s;itions have been long indulged, they gain &s;uch power over the mind, as to lead per&s;ons forward, even to their de&s;truction.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it any proof of a per&s;on's being in favor with God, that he is great, and rich, and powerful?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> But may there not be other ends of God's providence an&s;wered, by rai&s;ing a wicked per&s;on to a high &s;tation?</P>

<P>GOD conducted, that is, led the chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in their journey through the wilderne&s;s. A pillar of a cloud went before them by day, and a pillar of fire by night. They were fed miraculou&s;ly; for God cau&s;ed manna (of which they made a kind of bread) and quails, to fall about their camp. When they could find no &s;prings of water, he cau&s;ed water to come out of a rock; and their clothes did not wear out all the time they were in the wil|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the great things which God did for them, they often &s;inned again&s;t him, and were often puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>As they travelled along they met with a king called <HI>Amalek,</HI> and he came out again&s;t them with a great army; but God gave the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> power over their ene|mies,
<PB N="52" REF="028888_0055_0FDE591EA65395A0">
and they got the better of them, and vanqui&s;hed them; that is, beat them in battle.</P>
<P>One day Almighty God called <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> up to a high mountain, called <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> and covered him with a cloud from the &s;ight of the people. Then God was plea&s;|ed to reveal his will to him, and gave him Ten Commandments written upon two tables of &s;tone, that he might teach them to the people. The&s;e are the Ten Com|mandments which are frequently read in places of public wor&s;hip, and which we mu&s;t all learn and ob&s;erve, becau&s;e they were given by God him&s;elf, and they teach us our duty to him and to all the world.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the fir&s;t commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Thou &s;halt have no other gods before me.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the &s;econd?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Thou &s;halt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likene&s;s of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the wa|ter under the earth; thou &s;halt not bow down thy&s;elf to them, or &s;erve them, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, vi|&s;iting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
<PB N="53" REF="028888_0056_0FDE587689FB0DC0">
children, unto the third and fourth gene|ration of them that hate me, and &s;hewing mercy unto thou&s;ands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do we learn from the&s;e com|mandments?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> From the fir&s;t and &s;econd command|ments we learn that there is but one God, that he only is to be wor&s;hipped, and that idolatry, which is adoring any other being, or wor&s;hipping any image, or the likene&s;s of any thing; is a very great &s;in.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Were there ever any people guilty of idolatry, or wor&s;hipping images?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> them&s;elves fre|quently bowed down to idols, for which they were &s;everely puni&s;hed; and &s;o did mo&s;t of the nations near them; for which, and for other wicked things that they did, many of them were de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why are we to wor&s;hip God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e he has all power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s; and becau&s;e he has be|&s;towed upon us all that we po&s;&s;e&s;s that makes us happy in our pre&s;ent life; he made the &s;un, which gives us light and heat; he &s;ends rain upon the earth, that it may bring forth corn and plants to feed us, and gra&s;s for cattle: he has likewi&s;e ble&s;&s;ed us with an under&s;tanding, that we
<PB N="54" REF="028888_0057_0FDE592420293B08">
may learn the proper u&s;e of every thing which he has given us.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> If God be &s;o good, how can he pu|ni&s;h us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The wicked certainly de&s;erve puni&s;h|ment. But he generally puni&s;hes them in or|der that they may repent and become good, or that their example may prevent others from being wicked. The Jews, notwith|&s;tanding God had been &s;o good to them, grew forgetful of him, and wor&s;hipped idols, and committed &s;ins, for which rea|&s;ons they were carried away by their ene|mies, and are now &s;cattered abroad in every part of the world, and generally de|&s;pi&s;ed and ill-treated.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What further do we learn from the fir&s;t and &s;econd commandments?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We &s;hould learn to love God above all things, and always to obey his com|mandments. For if we prefer our own inclinations, or any thing in the world, to our duty to God, we &s;hall be &s;erving and plea&s;ing our&s;elves, in&s;tead of &s;erving and plea&s;ing him; and this is a kind of ido|latry.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> By what means &s;hall we learn to &s;erve God only?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We mu&s;t never neglect &s;aying our prayers, attending his wor&s;hip, or any re|ligious duty, for the &s;ake of our friends,
<PB N="55" REF="028888_0058_0FDE587C7B0A6140">
our bu&s;ine&s;s, or our plea&s;ure; and at all times give up every advantage, and con|quer any wi&s;h, that is contrary to his will, and to what we believe to be right.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the third commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Thou &s;halt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s that taketh his name in vain.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the meaning of taking the name of the Lord in vain?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To mention the name of God with|out reverence (that is, great re&s;pect) or upon any other than a &s;erious occa&s;ion, is certainly taking his name in vain; but to call upon it to witne&s;s a fal&s;ehood, or in profane cur&s;ing or &s;wearing, is &s;till more wicked.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it then unlawful to &s;wear?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Profane &s;wearing is certainly forbid|den by this commandment; and be&s;ides, we are told by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and by the apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> not to &s;wear at all, but al|ways carefully to &s;peak truth.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How &s;hall we learn to avoid this &s;in, which &s;o many people are committing every day?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By never keeping company with tho&s;e who are in the wicked practice of break|ing this commandment&mdash;We &s;hould al&s;o avoid reading plays, or ballads, or ro|mances,
<PB N="56" REF="028888_0059_0FDE59289EAD93A0">
or any other books, where the name of God is frequently mentioned without proper re&s;pect; for it is not enough that we guard again&s;t &s;peaking lightly of God, we mu&s;t learn too never to <HI>think</HI> of him, but with awe and rever|ence.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is there any other rule for us to ob|&s;erve, in order that we may keep this com|mandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that we al|ways perform our religious duties with &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s and attention; never thinking of our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, or our amu&s;ements, when we hear or read good books, or whil&s;t we are offering up our prayers: for if we read of God with indifference, or &s;peak to him in prayer, without earne&s;tly wi&s;hing that he &s;hould hear, and attend to our pe|titions; then we &s;hall prove di&s;obedient to him, by breaking this commandment; and let us remember, that God will not hold him guiltle&s;s that taketh his name in vain.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the fourth commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Remember the &s;abbath-day to keep it holy. Six days &s;halt thou labor and do all thy work, but the &s;eventh day is the &s;abbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou &s;halt not do any work, thou, nor thy &s;on, nor thy daughter, thy man &s;ervant, nor thy maid &s;ervant, nor thy cattle, nor the
<PB N="57" REF="028888_0060_0FDE58839C214370">
&s;tranger that is within thy gates. For the Lord ble&s;&s;ed the &s;abbath day, and hal|lowed it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What mu&s;t we do in order to keep the &s;abbath-day holy?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;pend it in the mo&s;t u&s;eful and &s;erious manner; thinking upon good things, reading the holy &s;criptures and good books, and praying to God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Ought we not to be good every other day in the week, as well as on a Sunday?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We &s;hould always remember God, and keep his commandments. Every morning we &s;hould pray to him, and re|&s;olve to be as good as we can during the day; and every night repent of any thing that we may have done that is wrong, and determine with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God to do &s;o no more.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How then are we to keep the &s;ab|bath more holy than other days?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> On other days the cares of life, and our proper bu&s;ine&s;s, take up much of our time, and therefore we have le&s;s time for reading and thinking. For this rea&s;on we &s;hould not con&s;ider the &s;abbath as a day of amu&s;ement and re&s;t, but as a day appoint|ed for going to wor&s;hip, to read good books, to think of God, and of another world after death.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="028888_0061_0FDE592EA0ECF868">
<HI>Q.</HI> But we &s;ee that many per&s;ons do not regularly go to wor&s;hip, but amu&s;e them|&s;elves on a Sunday. Do the&s;e all do wrong?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is certainly a great crime not to keep the &s;abbath holy, and we may &s;uppo&s;e that tho&s;e who do not remember their duty to God, to whom they owe their life, and every comfort, we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch in time &s;hould be guilty of many &s;ins. Indeed we find that mo&s;t of the unhappy men who are condemned to death for their wickedne&s;s, have generally begun by breaking the &s;abbath, and keeping bad company.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is wor&s;hipping God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To wor&s;hip God, is to reverence him as our Sovereign and Creator, to love him as our con&s;tant and kinde&s;t friend, and to thank him in the mo&s;t grateful manner, for the favors which he is continually be|&s;towing, and earne&s;tly to de&s;ire that he would teach us how to de&s;erve them, to lament our &s;ins, to re&s;olve with his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to &s;in no more, and to be re&s;igned to his holy will. The&s;e di&s;po&s;itions &s;incerely felt, and humbly offered up to heaven, is that wor&s;hip which is acceptable to God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But may we not &s;erve God in this manner at home?</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="028888_0062_0FDE588D235C75B0">
<HI>A.</HI> It is very po&s;&s;ible we may, and it is to be hoped that we frequently do; but we &s;hould remember, that at home a thou|&s;and things may break in upon us, and in|terrupt the di&s;charge of this duty; it is therefore very right, that a day &s;hould be &s;et apart for it, and by attending a place of public wor&s;hip on that day, we are &s;et|ting a good example to others.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But are we &s;ure that our example will be followed;</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We know that men in general are much led by example, but if our example &s;hould not be followed, at lea&s;t we are doing our duty; let us therefore always attend our different places of wor&s;hip, &s;ince it will afford us the be&s;t opportunity of thanking God, and learning how to obey him, and in order that we may fulfil this commandment of keeping the &s;abbath-day holy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the fifth commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Honor thy father and mother.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How mu&s;t we behave to our parents, in order to honor them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We mu&s;t treat them upon every oc|ca&s;ion with the greate&s;t re&s;pect and affec|tion, attend to their advice, receive with patience their reproofs, and obey them in every thing, which is not wrong, becau&s;e God has placed them over us, that we may

<P><HI>Q.</HI> How mu&s;t tho&s;e behave, who&s;e pa|rents are cruel and unkind?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They mu&s;t &s;till endeavour to &s;erve, and to obey them, and return their ill u&s;age with gentlene&s;s and good humour.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> If our parents &s;hould be wicked, and &s;et us a bad example?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That indeed would be a great mi&s;|fortune; yet perhaps by &s;eeing the vex|ation and mi&s;ery, which they &s;uffer from their idlene&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, or their di&s;|hone&s;ty; we may learn the nece&s;&s;ity of becoming indu&s;trious, &s;ober, and ju&s;t; we &s;hould be &s;till more watchful over our own conduct, &s;teadily refu&s;ing to obey, even our parents, whenever they would per|&s;uade us to do wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Will not this offend God, who has commanded us to honor our parents?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When God commanded us to ho|nor our parents, he likewi&s;e required that our parents &s;hould teach us how to be good, and to obey him. To &s;ubmit then to the advice of a good parent, is to obey God; but to refu&s;e to follow the example of bad parents, or their advice, when they advi&s;e any thing wrong, that is to honor God, who is the father of us all.</P>

Be&s;ides, by doing right in &s;uch ca&s;es, we &s;et a good example to our parents, we re&s;pect their happine&s;s, which is honoring them in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of the command|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the &s;ixth commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Thou &s;halt not kill.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Will God puni&s;h tho&s;e who de&s;troy the life of another?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Undoubtedly he will. It is one of the greate&s;t crimes we can commit, in the &s;ight both of God and of men. In this world it is puni&s;hed with death, for it is one of tho&s;e injuries we never can repair, and what God (as we &s;ee in the example of <HI>Cain</HI>) puni&s;hed even in this life, in a very exemplary manner.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> May we not kill our&s;elves when we become tired of living?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. That is almo&s;t, perhaps quite as great a &s;in. God, who gave us life, ought only to put an end to it. He gave it us for wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es, that we might conquer every wrong di&s;po&s;ition, and acquire every di&s;po&s;ition and principle that is good, &s;o as to make our&s;elves wor|thy to enjoy eternal happine&s;s in the life to come. Therefore by putting an end to our lives whil&s;t we are in an unprepared &s;tate, we may deprive our&s;elves for ever

<P><HI>Q.</HI> By killing another, may we not en|danger his future happine&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By taking away the life of another, we do not know what injury we may have done him in this re&s;pect. It is certain that we unju&s;tly deprive his relations and friends of the comforts he might have pro|cured them, and by &s;uch a crime we for|feit our own lives, at a time when, in&s;tead of being prepared, we have de&s;erved the &s;evere&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of God.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Thou &s;halt not commit adultery.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> It is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much upon this &s;ubject at pre&s;ent. It may be &s;uffi|cient to ob&s;erve, that it is a &s;in in which perhaps the happine&s;s of an innocent fa|mily, and the character of one who ought to be an example of virtue, is wantonly de&s;troyed. It is a &s;in, the con&s;equences of which are highly di&s;graceful and infa|mous among men, and it will be right to impre&s;s our minds with a per&s;ua&s;ion, that it is &s;o wicked in the &s;ight of God, that tho&s;e who are in the practice of it, cannot be admitted into the kingdom of heaven, as we are a&s;&s;ured in the holy &s;criptures.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Men are often led to &s;teal from ne|ce&s;&s;ity, or want; and as idlene&s;s and &s;quan|dering are the common cau&s;es of want, we &s;hould endeavour, whil&s;t we are young, to get habits both of indu&s;try and of &s;aving. For it is not always tho&s;e who can get the mo&s;t, unle&s;s they are careful to &s;ave, and prudent in making a proper u&s;e of what they get, that are the mo&s;t comfortable. When parents who can get money &s;pend it in alehou&s;es, and are drunken, and &s;ome|times in con&s;equence idle, we &s;ee their children, and them&s;elves dirty and ragged, and frequently guilty of thieving.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="028888_0067_0FDE593D5AE54100">
<HI>Q.</HI> Is there any thing el&s;e that we can ob&s;erve the better to keep us from this &s;in?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If you are &s;ober, indu&s;trious, and &s;aving, you will have no temptation to &s;teal: if you are &s;erious and mindful of your duty to God, and con&s;ider that your happine&s;s in a future life depends very much on your keeping his commandments here, you will be &s;hocked at the idea of every thing that is di&s;hone&s;t; and you will not take any thing, however trifling, le&s;t you get a habit of &s;tealing. For the wor&s;t and wickede&s;t of thieves mo&s;t likely began with &s;tealing things of little value.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the ninth commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t thy neighbour.</P>
<P>All kind of fal&s;ehood whatever is highly di&s;plea&s;ing to God, who is the God of truth:&mdash;and a liar is a character which all mankind abhor. Indeed it is ea&s;y to con|ceive, that if the practice of lying was com|mon among&s;t men, they could put no tru&s;t in one another, and con&s;equently could not live together. The good would not know what poor to relieve, if they could not be|lieve their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do we know that lying is &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God has &s;trictly forbidden it, and as &s;oon as you can read the new Te&s;tament,
<PB N="65" REF="028888_0068_0FDE589F39E47AF8">
you may find there a very remarkable ac|count of a man and his wife, called <HI>Ana|nias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI> who were both &s;truck dead for telling a fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Pray what is the meaning of bearing fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t our neighbour?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is the wor&s;t kind of lying, be|cau&s;e it not only is a &s;in again&s;t God and truth, but it is a &s;in again&s;t our neighbour, whom we ought to love. If we bear fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t our neighbour in any courts of law, this is called perjury, and is pu|ni&s;hed by cutting off the ears, and expo&s;ing the guilty per&s;on in a pillory. But if we rai&s;e a fal&s;e or &s;candalous report, or tell &s;tories of a neighbour, this is called a ca|lumny, and is a very mean and wicked action, and will make us hated and de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the tenth commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Thou &s;halt not covet thy neighbour's hou&s;e, thou &s;halt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his man &s;ervant, nor his maid &s;ervant, nor his ox, nor his a&s;s, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the meaning of coveting?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To covet is to wi&s;h for that which we have not, and which we have no right to; to covet our neighbour's hou&s;e is di&s;hone&s;t, and this covetous di&s;po&s;ition, if given way to, will lead us in time to cheat, and to tell lies, and to &s;teal. To covet our neigh|bour's
<PB N="66" REF="028888_0069_0FDE5941E9132AD0">
wife is a kind of adultery; and to indulge a covetous temper is to lay the foundation of almo&s;t every &s;in.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How &s;hall we prevent our&s;elves from breaking this commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By never giving way to bad thoughts, but to check them in the very beginning, becau&s;e bad thoughts give ri&s;e to bad wi&s;hes and inclinations and to covetou&s;|ne&s;s; and bad inclinations, and covetou&s;|ne&s;s, give ri&s;e to bad conduct, and to &s;teal|ing, adultery, telling lies, and to bearing fal&s;e witne&s;s. So if we would be good, we mu&s;t &s;hun the very fir&s;t appearance of evil. For God, as we may read in the New Te&s;tament, is di&s;plea&s;ed both with bad thoughts, as well as with bad actions.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> If we never give way to bad thoughts, &s;hall we never be guilty of bad actions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the &s;ure&s;t way of guarding again&s;t them, and the ea&s;ie&s;t way to be good; be|cau&s;e bad thoughts always go before bad wi&s;hes and bad actions; and bad thoughts are more ea&s;ily avoided, than bad habits are conquered.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ten commandments, which are frequently read in places of public wor|&s;hip, and which we mu&s;t all learn, and ob|&s;erve, becau&s;e they were given by God him&s;elf, and they teach us our duty to him and to mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="028888_0070_0FDE58A51B4BEA40">
By the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, and fourth, we learn, that there is no God but one, and that we &s;hould fear to offend, and love him above all things, and wor&s;hip him, becau&s;e he made us, and can de&s;troy us in a moment. We learn by the fifth to be dutiful to our parents, and tho&s;e that are &s;et over us in their &s;tead: and by the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, we are taught neither to murder, &s;teal, or do any manner of wrong; nor to &s;peak ill of any body, or ever to covet; that is, to wi&s;h for any thing that belongs to another. Becau&s;e as God knows our thoughts, he will puni&s;h wicked thoughts, as well as wicked doings.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was forty days and forty nights at the top of <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> learning all the&s;e, and many more good things from God. But, in the mean time, the ungrateful <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> grew tired of waiting for him.</P>
<P>In their impatience they &s;uppo&s;ed that he never would come back, and &s;o re|quired <HI>Aaron,</HI> the brother of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to make an idol for them, that they might wor&s;hip, that is, that they might pray to.</P>
<P><HI>Aaron</HI> was grieved to hear them talk &s;o wickedly, and &s;imply, but was &s;o weak as to fear that they would kill him, if he refu&s;ed them. Therefore he took the gold and &s;ilver which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> had given
<PB N="68" REF="028888_0071_0FDE59479FF98430">
them; he melted it over the fire, and made an image of it in the &s;hape of a calf; and a great many of them wor&s;hipped it, like their neighbours the heathens, and like the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> While they were &s;o doing, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> came down from the moun|tain; and when he &s;aw what they were about, he was &s;o provoked, that the tables fell out of his hand, and were broken to pieces. And God was &s;o offended at their wickedne&s;s, as to command that the mo&s;t notorious of tho&s;e who were guilty of ido|latry, that is, of wor&s;hipping the idol or image, &s;hould be &s;lain. There were twelve thou&s;and killed that day, and he made tho&s;e who were left wander about forty years in that place, which was called the De&s;ert or Wilderne&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here it will not be ami&s;s to teach them the 95^t^h p&s;alm.</NOTE> before they were permitted to go into the promi&s;ed land, as a puni&s;hment for their &s;tubbornne&s;s. Almighty God al&s;o thought fit to puni&s;h &s;everal other bad things, that &s;ome of them were guilty of.</P>
<P>Before this time, he had been plea&s;ed to command a &s;ort of table to be built with &s;tones &s;et over one another. This table was called an altar, and upon that altar he bid them lay a lamb, or a dove,
<PB N="69" REF="028888_0072_0FDE58AAEB25C2D8">
or &s;ome other thing; and whatever was laid upon the altar with wood under it, was called the Sacrifice, becau&s;e it was &s;acrificed; that is, offered to God, as an acknowledgment that all we have comes from him, and that our be&s;t &s;ervices are due to him. And when God was plea&s;ed with tho&s;e who offered it, he &s;ent down fire from heaven to burn or con&s;ume the &s;acrifice, as a token that he accepted of it, and he forbade that any common fire &s;hould ever be put to it. But one day two very bold young men, <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu,</HI> had the a&s;&s;urance to di&s;obey, and to put common fire upon the altar to burn the &s;acrifice; but God &s;oon puni&s;hed their pre&s;umption by &s;ending fire from heaven, which burnt them up, and nobody could &s;ave them.</P>
<P>Another time there was a man who was &s;o wicked and pre&s;umptuous as to &s;peak again&s;t God, his Maker; and this great &s;in is called bla&s;phemy. And God Al|mighty commanded, that every one &s;hould throw &s;tones upon the bla&s;phemer till he was cru&s;hed to death, and it was done ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>Even <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who was &s;o good a man, forgot him&s;elf one day: he was &s;o pro|voked by the people's ob&s;tinacy, as to be in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and offended his

ago, have been wonderfully fulfilled. The <HI>Jews,</HI> though they were &s;o highly favored of God, proved di&s;obedient and idola|trous, and they have been driven out of the promi&s;ed land by their enemies. Their di&s;tre&s;s, when they have been be&s;ieged, has been &s;o great, that parents have eaten their children. Their temple was utterly de&s;troyed. Their land is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and they are &s;cattered and de&s;pi&s;ed over the face of the earth.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Were the <HI>Egyptians</HI> idolaters?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The <HI>Egyptians</HI> were great idolaters, and therefore the miracles and wonders
<PB N="76" REF="028888_0079_0FDE595D5D11AE50">
which God enabled <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to perform, might be in mercy de&s;igned not only to deliver the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but al&s;o to cure the <HI>Egyptians</HI> of their idolatry. The pride and ob&s;tinacy of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> gave oc|ca&s;ion for the&s;e miracles, and on that ac|count he was judged a proper per&s;on to be their king by Almighty God, who &s;ays, "for this purpo&s;e have I rai&s;ed him up."</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is meant, when it is &s;aid, that God hardened the heart of <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> Did God make him wicked?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: for Almighty God has no plea|&s;ure in the death of a &s;inner, but would rather that he &s;hould repent and live. It was therefore <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s own pride and ob&s;tinacy that was the cau&s;e of his de|&s;truction. In other places, <HI>Pharaoh</HI> is &s;aid to have hardened his own heart: it was not therefore by any extraordinary influ|ence of God upon his mind that his heart was hardened, nor could Almighty God be &s;aid to have done it, in any other man|ner, than as he may be &s;aid to be the doer of every thing which he does not prevent.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the greate&s;t happine&s;s any one can attain?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The greate&s;t happine&s;s any one can attain, is to know the one living and true God; that is, to have true apprehen&s;ions of his infinite holine&s;s, mercy, and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s;

from which we may learn what we mu&s;t do, and what &s;ort of per&s;ons we mu&s;t become in order to obtain his favor. The <HI>Egyptians,</HI> in common with other hea|thens, were great idolaters; they were mi&s;erably ignorant of the great God, and wor&s;hipped various different animals: to bring them therefore to the knowledge of him&s;elf, by whatever means, was really the greate&s;t favor that could be be&s;towed upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Pray how do we know all the&s;e things?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God Almighty in his great goodne&s;s was plea&s;ed, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;hould write them all down, and leave it for us who came after, that we might know his will and his greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>So <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> wrote the hi&s;tory of the crea|tion, the fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> the death of <HI>Abel,</HI> the flood, the confu&s;ion of <HI>Babel,</HI> the de|&s;truction of <HI>Sodom,</HI> the hi&s;tory of <HI>Abraham,</HI> of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and the &s;tory of <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> All the&s;e he wrote in one book, called the book of <HI>Gene&s;is. Mo&s;es</HI> after|wards wrote the account of his own birth, of the plagues of <HI>Egypt,</HI> of the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> of their wan|dering in the wilderne&s;s forty years, of all that befel them there, and all that God directed them to do. The&s;e matters are
<PB N="78" REF="028888_0081_0FDE59629AF40E10">
in four other books, called <HI>Exodus, Levi|ticus, Numbers,</HI> and <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> which with <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> are &s;ometimes called the <HI>Pen|tateuch, i. e.</HI> five books.</P>
<P>God directed tho&s;e that came in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s place, after his death, to write what had happened in their time. So we have all the hi&s;tory of the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> almo&s;t till the coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. We have al&s;o an account of Chri&s;t's life and death. All this is together in one great book, called the Holy Bible, becau&s;e it contains the word of God. And the word of God is called revelation, becau&s;e God has revealed, that is, told it to us. Some part of the Bible is always read in public wor&s;hip. It is the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t book in the whole world. Other books are written out of men's own heads, or out of what they pick up from others, but the Bible was written by good men, to whom God revealed his will; and it teaches all that is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know, and be, and do, in order to our pa&s;&s;ing comfortably through this world, and being happy for ever in the next.</P>
<P>When you can read it, and are old enough to under&s;tand it, you will be al|lowed to read it all your&s;elf.</P>

He was to in&s;truct them in every thing that was fit for them to do, and tell them what they ought not to do. He that governed the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in tho&s;e days was called their judge.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="028888_0083_0FDE596A289BD7F0">
When therefore <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> became judge of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> he drew near the fir&s;t city in the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> called <HI>Jericho,</HI> and &s;ent privately into the city to get an account of the place and of the people in it. They who are employed in this manner are call|ed &s;pies; and when a &s;py belonging to the enemy is found in any place, he is always put to death. The&s;e &s;pies were very near being caught in <HI>Jericho;</HI> but a woman called <HI>Rahab,</HI> who lived near the gate of the city, took compa&s;&s;ion on them. She hid them in her hou&s;e till it was night, and then let them out of a window by fa&s;|tening cords to it. Before they went away, &s;he made them promi&s;e, that in return, for having &s;aved their lives, &s;he and her family &s;hould be &s;pared when the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city.</P>
<P>After this God commanded <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to march with all the people to the river of <HI>Jordan,</HI> which ran between them and <HI>Je|richo.</HI> He then ordered, that the &s;ons of <HI>Levi,</HI> called <HI>Levites,</HI> &s;hould carry the ark, and walk before the re&s;t into the river, and &s;tand in the middle of it, with the ark. When they drew near, behold! to the great amazement of all the people, the waters divided as at the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and they pa&s;&s;ed over without &s;o much as wetting their feet. Afterwards the people pa&s;&s;ed over al&s;o,
<PB N="81" REF="028888_0084_0FDE58E1DDE15E48">
and then the waters immediately returned to their old place.</P>
<P>The next wonder that God performed for the &s;ake of his people, was at the town of <HI>Jericho.</HI> He commanded <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to lead them round the town &s;even days together, blowing a trumpet every time, and on the &s;eventh day the walls of the city tumbled down. By this means the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> march|ed in without any difficulty, and were ma&s;|ters of the place. The people to whom it belonged having oppo&s;ed the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and being &s;uch wicked idolaters, God com|manded the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to kill them all, except <HI>Rahab</HI> and her family, accord|ing to the promi&s;e the &s;pies had made her. So they took great care of her, and all that belonged to her, for what good man ever forgets tho&s;e that have been good to him? All the kings of that neighbourhood, jea|lous of their &s;ucce&s;s, came out at different times and fought again&s;t them. Whenever the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> acted wickedly, God &s;uffered their enemies to beat them; and from the &s;tory of one of them called <HI>Acham,</HI> which is mentioned in the &s;criptures, one may learn that nothing is hid from the all-&s;eeing eye of God. But whenever they repented and behaved well, his anger was appea&s;ed, and then they again became &s;tronger than their enemies, and the victory was on their &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="028888_0085_0FDE5971F686D4F0">
<HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> having thus conquered almo&s;t all the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> divided it into twelve parts, according to the twelve tribes of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> He made eleven of the tribes draw lots for their &s;hares, that there might be no di&s;putes among them. As for the tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> they did not draw, becau&s;e God had provided for them in another way; for he thought proper they &s;hould be his mini&s;ters, and always attend on his immediate &s;ervice; that is, employ them|&s;elves entirely in explaining the &s;criptures, praying and doing &s;acrifice at the altar. And as <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> the beloved &s;on of <HI>Jacob,</HI> had two &s;ons, <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> of the&s;e were formed two tribes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Were the inhabitants of <HI>Canaan</HI> to be blamed for oppo&s;ing the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who came to take their country from them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They were certainly not to be blamed for endeavouring to repel invaders, if they did not know that what the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> did in this re&s;pect was by the expre&s;s command of Almighty God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Although they did oppo&s;e them, and were &s;uch wicked idolaters, why did God order the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to de&s;troy them?</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="028888_0086_0FDE58E8913E4A98">
<HI>A.</HI> We do not always know the rea&s;ons of God's di&s;pen&s;ations, but we may be &s;ure that they are ever founded in mercy as well as ju&s;tice. You remember that the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> had been promi&s;ed to <HI>Abraham</HI> above four hundred years before, and that this promi&s;e was very often afterwards re|peated; but it was not to be fulfilled till <Q>the iniquity of the old inhabitants was full;</Q> that is, till they were become &s;o wicked that they were not fit to live; and Almighty God had &s;urely a right to de|&s;troy them in whatever way he &s;aw be&s;t; by the hand of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> as well as by an earthquake or famine. Moreover, this &s;ignal de&s;truction of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> of which the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> them&s;elves were made the in&s;truments, would be an awful warn|ing to them, to avoid tho&s;e &s;ins which had brought the divine judgments on that people.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What was the ark which the <HI>Levites</HI> carried before the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> over the river <HI>Jordan?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was &s;omething like a che&s;t, in which God commanded the two tables of the law to be carefully kept; and this ark he committed to the care of the <HI>Levites,</HI> and did not &s;uffer it to be produced, but upon extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE BOOK OF JUDGES.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER all the&s;e things, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> died in a good old age; and he had been &s;o worthy a man, that all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> mourned for him many days. They remained &s;ome time without any judge, and being like a flock of &s;heep without a &s;hepherd, very often went a&s;tray. In&s;tead of obeying the laws of God, which they had been &s;o often taught, and which were &s;ufficient to guide them, they cho&s;e to follow the inclinations of their own hearts, which were di&s;po&s;ed to evil. Bad people cannot live long in peace and quiet with one another, for they always want more than they have a right to, and do not &s;cruple injuring others. Unju&s;t actions mu&s;t always produce quar|rels, for nobody will let another oppre&s;s him, if he can help it.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>Gibeah,</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> did a mo&s;t barbarous wicked thing by one of the <HI>Levites,</HI> for which all the other tribes re&s;olved to puni&s;h them. The re&s;t of the <HI>Benjamites,</HI> in&s;tead of cor|recting their wicked relations, took their part. This brought on a civil war, in
<PB N="85" REF="028888_0088_0FDE58F0F7BA8A60">
which the tribe of <HI>Benjamin</HI> was almo&s;t all de&s;troyed.&mdash;A civil war is, when people of the &s;ame nation go to war with each other.&mdash;This was a very bloody one, and when it was over, the other tribes repented hav|ing dealt &s;o hardly with their brethren the <HI>Benjamites,</HI> and they all became good friends again.</P>
<P>They were, however, much oppre&s;&s;ed by their neighbours the Syrians. They called to God for help, and he appointed <HI>Othniel</HI> to be their judge, who led them on to fight their battles, and &s;aved them from their enemies. After his death they fell into idolatry, and then God delivered them into the hands of the <HI>Moabites;</HI> but when they repented, <HI>Ehud</HI> was made judge of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and overcame their adver&s;aries; that is, their enemies. The next judge was <HI>Shamgar;</HI> he conquered the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> who had fallen upon them; but when he died, they returned again. Then a wi&s;e woman, named <HI>Deborah</HI> the Prophete&s;s, and <HI>Barak,</HI> a valiant, that is, a brave man, both governed <HI>I&s;rael</HI> together, and gained a victory over the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> When the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> found them&s;elves delivered from their enemies, they were very joyful; and <HI>Deborah</HI> the Prophete&s;s made a fine &s;ong, called a hymn or p&s;alm of thank&s;giving,
<PB N="86" REF="028888_0089_0FDE59822BD19B08">
&s;uch as are &s;ung in places of public wor|&s;hip, to prai&s;e God for his goodne&s;s to us.</P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Deborah,</HI> the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> fell again into idolatry, and God permitted the <HI>Midianites</HI> to rule and oppre&s;s them for &s;even years; but when they repented, and called to him for help, he &s;ent his angel to call <HI>Gideon,</HI> who was thre&s;hing wheat in a barn, and <HI>Gideon,</HI> with God's help, &s;oon freed them from their enemies.</P>
<P>When <HI>Gideon</HI> died, one of his &s;ons, called <HI>Abimelech,</HI> murdered almo&s;t all his brothers, intending to be king of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> This occa&s;ioned great di&s;turbances among them, but they were quieted by his un|timely death; for God permitted his life to be taken away by a woman throwing a &s;tone at him</P>
<P><HI>Tola</HI> was judge after him, and then <HI>Jair;</HI> in both their times the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> provoked God by their &s;ins, and he delivered them up to the <HI>Ammonites.</HI> After this the peo|ple became penitent, that is, they repented, and then he gave them <HI>Jephtha</HI> as their judge. He was a great warrior, but one ra&s;h action that he committed, made the remainder of his life unhappy. When he was going out to fight the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> he vowed, if God gave him the victory, he would &s;acrifice the fir&s;t thing he met when he returned home. He did conquer the
<PB N="87" REF="028888_0090_0FDE58F6F5228230">
<HI>Ammonites,</HI> but his only daughter not hav|ing heard of his vow, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o impatient to &s;ee her father again, that &s;he met him fir&s;t of all; &s;o to his great grief he was obliged to fulfil his vow, in con&s;ecrating her to the Lord to remain unmarried all her days, that being the only way in which he could make good his vow in re&s;pect of her. When <HI>Jephtha</HI> died, <HI>Ibzan</HI> was judge in his place; after <HI>Ibzan</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>Elon,</HI> and after <HI>Elon, Abdon</HI> was judge. When <HI>Abdon</HI> died, the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>I&s;rael</HI> very much, till <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> was &s;ent by the Al|mighty to deliver them. It plea&s;ed God to make <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t man in the world. He killed a lion without any help, and de&s;troyed many of the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> At length he fell into their hands, but not till he had killed a thou&s;and of them with only the jaw bone of an a&s;s; and then he carried away upon his back the gates of the city where he was confined, and made his e&s;cape. But it was not long before they took him again, by the treachery of a wicked woman called <HI>Da|lilah.</HI> The <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> offered her money, if &s;he would find &s;ome means to deliver him up to them, which &s;he did.</P>
<P>One day the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> made a great fea&s;t to their idol god <HI>Dagon,</HI> in his tem|ple, and when they were in the mid&s;t of
<PB N="88" REF="028888_0091_0FDE598CCD28F908">
their mirth and jollity, they &s;ent for <HI>Samp|&s;on,</HI> to laugh at him and tea&s;e him. But the time was come, when it plea&s;ed God to deliver his people from &s;uch cruel ene|mies; for <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> finding him&s;elf in their temple with tho&s;e bad people, called upon God to help him; then taking hold of the pillars that &s;upported the building, and loo&s;ening them, the roof fell down and cru&s;hed them all to death. After this the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were quiet for &s;everal years, and <HI>Eli,</HI> the high-prie&s;t, became judge of <HI>I&s;|rael.</HI> There was a young man named <HI>Samuel,</HI> who had been bred up under <HI>Eli</HI> from a child; and <HI>Samuel</HI> was &s;o pious and virtuous a youth, that God was fre|quently plea&s;ed to &s;peak with him, and to reveal to him his will, &s;o that he became a great prophet; <HI>Eli</HI> the high-prie&s;t was good him&s;elf, but he &s;uffered his children to be wicked, and that is a great &s;in. His two &s;ons, <HI>Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phineas,</HI> behaved very ill; and though he knew it was his duty to puni&s;h them while they were young, in order to make them better, he gave him&s;elf no trouble about it; and as they were not contradicted, they grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e. They at la&s;t brought on their own ruin, as well as their father's, for they were killed in battle by the <HI>Phi|li&s;tines,</HI> who over-ran all the country; the
<PB N="89" REF="028888_0092_0FDE58FE0C896578">
ark al&s;o was taken; and when old <HI>Eli</HI> heard the news, he fell down with grief, and broke his neck and died. Then was <HI>Samuel</HI> made a judge in his place, who kept the people in very good order, and followed the will of God in all things. However, the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> at la&s;t grew tired of having only judges over them, and had a mind to be governed by a king, as other nations were. God Almighty, who knows all things, knew they would never be &s;o happy under a king as under a great pro|phet, like <HI>Samuel,</HI> who con&s;ulted his will in every thing; but he told them, &s;ince they had &s;o great a de&s;ire for a king, they &s;hould have one. Accordingly he com|manded <HI>Samuel</HI> to anoint a young man, called <HI>Saul,</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Benjamin.</HI> It is an ancient cu&s;tom to anoint a king with oil before he is crowned; therefore God commanded it, as a token that <HI>Saul</HI> was the king he had cho&s;en for them. <HI>Samuel,</HI> however, &s;till governed <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for a great while longer, becau&s;e the people knew he was a good man and a great prophet.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is a prophet?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A prophet is one to whom God com|municates the knowledge of &s;uch things,
<PB N="90" REF="028888_0093_0FDE5996E8A5F9B0">
whether pre&s;ent, pa&s;t, or to come, as cannot be learned without his particular a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and to &s;peak or to write &s;uch things is called prophe&s;ying. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a prophet, for he wrote the hi&s;tory of the creation; and he forewarned the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> before his death, what would be the con|&s;equence of their di&s;obeying the com|mands of God; he al&s;o foretold to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in the xviiith chapter of <HI>Deute|ronomy,</HI> that in future times the Lord God would rai&s;e up a prophet from among their brethren like unto him, who &s;hould &s;peak unto them all that God &s;hould com|mand him.</P>
<P>Some &s;illy people fancy, that witches and conjurers have the &s;ame power of foretelling things; or, as they call it, for|tune-telling; but witches and conjurers are all cheats and impo&s;tors, who pretend to know what they do not know, with a de&s;ign to get one's money, and to cheat one; and it is a great &s;in, as well as folly, to a&s;k them que&s;tions, or li&s;ten to them.</P>
<P>A true prophet is very unlike the&s;e cheats; he does not attempt to get our money, but endeavours to make us good; and may be known by the wonderful works which God enables him to do, as he did <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and many others. The&s;e wonderful works are called miracles, of
<PB N="91" REF="028888_0094_0FDE59031740CA10">
which our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles work|ed a great many, as you will read in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is a vow?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A vow is a &s;olemn and religious pro|mi&s;e made to God; and as all promi&s;es mu&s;t be faithfully ob&s;erved, that is, kept, &s;o mu&s;t tho&s;e which we make to God in a particular manner. All that God does for us is of his own free goodne&s;s, for we can give him nothing, becau&s;e every thing is his own, and he can take it when he plea&s;es; and he de&s;ires nothing of us but that we wor&s;hip him devoutly, and obey his laws, as he has told us in many parts of the &s;cripture. It is better, therefore, to avoid the&s;e vows, which are frequently made in di&s;tre&s;s, and to be re&s;igned to God without doing any thing like making a bargain with him.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be very cautious, even about making a promi&s;e, or taking an oath to one another; for when once the words are gone out of our lips, if they are not unlaw|ful, that is, contrary to God's law, we mu&s;t perform them. For nothing is &s;o ba&s;e as not keeping one's promi&s;e; and nobody will be regarded after having broken it. But it is &s;till wor&s;e than that, to take a fal&s;e oath; that is, to &s;wear a thing to be true which we know to be
<PB N="92" REF="028888_0095_0FDE59A0EF8E8B98">
otherwi&s;e; or to &s;wear a thing to be fal&s;e, which we know to be true. Either of the&s;e kinds of fal&s;e oaths is called perjury, which is a mo&s;t horrible &s;in.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is a high-prie&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The high-prie&s;t of the <HI>Jews</HI> was the chief of the prie&s;ts, who&s;e office or place it was, like them, to offer &s;acrifices and to burn incen&s;e, and to do other &s;ervices in the temple. It was his peculiar duty to go into the innermo&s;t part of the temple once every year, on the day of atonement, as it was called, to perform there the e&s;pe|cial, that is, the particular &s;ervices of that day. He was appointed al&s;o to over-look all the temple wor&s;hip, and to judge among the prie&s;ts and the people in many matters, both civil and religious.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Where do we find the hi&s;tory of the Judges of <HI>I&s;rael?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> You will find it all in that part of the &s;cripture called the Book of <HI>Judges.</HI> There were fifteen of them after the death of <HI>Jo&s;hua; Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Debo|rah, Barak, Gideon, Abimelech, Tola, Jair, Jephtha, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon, Samp&s;on, Eli,</HI> and <HI>Samuel.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">2 SAMUEL ii. &amp;c. THE REIGN OF KING DAVID</HEAD>
<P><HI>DAVID</HI> was great grand&s;on to <HI>Ruth,</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> who was a very good woman, and had been remarkable for her dutiful behaviour to her mother-in-law. Her &s;tory is in the Holy Bible, and is called, <HI>The Book of</HI> RUTH. Her &s;on <HI>Obed</HI> was the father of <HI>Je&s;&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI> was the father of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>David</HI> had been anointed king by the command of God, he continued with his family, waiting till God thought pro|per that he &s;hould reign over the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in the place of <HI>Saul.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after, <HI>Saul</HI> being di&s;turbed in mind, and very mi&s;erable, becau&s;e he knew he had offended God, de&s;ired his &s;ervants to &s;end &s;omebody who could play well upon the harp, to amu&s;e his grief. <HI>David</HI> could play very well, &s;o he was &s;ent for. His mu&s;ic was &s;o fine, that the king was much plea&s;ed: he li&s;tened to him with delight, and yet the moment <HI>David</HI> cea&s;ed (that is, left off) playing, the di&s;|temper of <HI>Saul</HI>'s mind returned.&mdash;There
<PB N="95" REF="028888_0098_0FDE590EE04F8BA0">
is no cure for a guilty con&s;cience, but re|conciling one's &s;elf to God by hearty re|pentance and amendment of life.&mdash;So <HI>Da|vid</HI> went back to his father.</P>
<P>Soon after the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> made war upon the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and &s;ent <HI>Goliath,</HI> a giant, to challenge any one of them. A giant is a man much taller and &s;tronger than other men: and <HI>Goliath</HI> was &s;o great a giant, that not one of <HI>Saul</HI>'s &s;oldiers dur&s;t en|counter, that is, fight with him, though <HI>Saul</HI> promi&s;ed his daughter in marriage to the man that &s;hould kill him. He came out for &s;everal days together, during them to battle; but they were all terrified at the &s;ight of him. At la&s;t young <HI>David</HI> hap|pened to be &s;ent to the camp, to bring &s;ome provi&s;ions to his brothers, who were &s;oldiers. When he &s;aw the giant, and heard his in&s;olent language, God in&s;pired him with courage, and he re&s;olved to go out and meet him. All the army of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> wondered and trembled for him: and when <HI>Goliath</HI> &s;aw what a &s;tripling he was, he &s;uppo&s;ed he had been &s;ent to mock him, and was very angry. The giant then came forward to de&s;troy <HI>David,</HI> but the young man took a &s;tone, which he threw from a &s;ling at him. It &s;truck his forehead, and he fell down: then <HI>David</HI> ran to him before he could recover him|&s;elf,
<PB N="96" REF="028888_0099_0FDE79743762AA48">
drew out <HI>Goliath</HI>'s &s;word as he lay upon the ground, and with it cut off his head.&mdash;<HI>David</HI> did many other great things, becau&s;e God a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, which made all the people admire him; and good <HI>Jona|than,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Saul,</HI> loved him as his own &s;oul. But as bad people are always jealous of tho&s;e who are better liked than them|&s;elves, &s;o <HI>Saul</HI> hated <HI>David,</HI> and would have been glad to have done him any mi&s;chief he could, though he was become his &s;on-in-law, being married to his daughter.</P>
<P>He tried &s;o often to put <HI>David</HI> to death, that <HI>David</HI> was obliged to go away and hide him&s;elf, &s;ometimes with the prophet <HI>Samuel,</HI> and &s;ometimes with the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> But the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> grew &s;u&s;picious, and took him for a &s;py, &s;o he dur&s;t not &s;tay long with them. He wandered about in the de&s;erts, and lodged in caves, while <HI>Saul</HI> was almo&s;t mad with fury that he could not find him. In the mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me <HI>David</HI> gained many friends, who went with him, and &s;hared his di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and there were &s;everal of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> that a&s;&s;i&s;ted him. There was, however, one man called <HI>Na|bal,</HI> who was brutal and churli&s;h, and be|haved with roughne&s;s and ill-nature to him. But his wife <HI>Abigail,</HI> a prudent, &s;en&s;ible woman, was much concerned when &s;he heard of it; and to &s;ave her hu&s;band from

the re&s;entment, that is, the anger he had rea&s;on to expect, &s;he went to <HI>David</HI> to make all the excu&s;es &s;he could, and to a&s;k his pardon.</P>
<P>Still <HI>Saul</HI> pur&s;ued <HI>David</HI> wherever he went. One day <HI>Saul</HI> happened to go into a cave where <HI>David</HI> was hid with two or three of his friends in a corner, out of &s;ight. Then <HI>Saul</HI> was in <HI>David</HI>'s power, and he could have ended all his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, by putting his unju&s;t enemy to death. But a good man would &s;uffer any thing rather than take revenge, or do a ba&s;e act, and would always return good for evil. So <HI>David</HI> let <HI>Saul</HI> e&s;cape, and yet that &s;tub|born king continued &s;till to be <HI>David</HI>'s enemy.</P>
<P>Another time <HI>Saul</HI>'s life was again in <HI>David</HI>'s power, but no provocation could tempt him to do him any hurt, &s;o they parted again: and then <HI>David,</HI> to be en|tirely out of his way, went and lived in the country of the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after, a fre&s;h war broke out between that nation and the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in which <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan</HI> his &s;on were killed in battle. When <HI>David</HI> heard the news, he was much concerned for <HI>Saul,</HI> becau&s;e he was his father-in-law and his king; and he grieved mo&s;t exceedingly for <HI>Jonathan,</HI> who had always behaved to him as a bro|ther

<P>After the time of mourning was pa&s;t, fir&s;t two of the tribes, and then the other ten ac|knowledged <HI>David</HI> king of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>He ruled for a great while with ju&s;tice and mercy, and was a wi&s;e and a great king. He never forgot the friend&s;hip of <HI>Jonathan</HI> towards him, but treated a poor lame &s;on that he left behind, called <HI>Mephi|bo&s;heth;</HI> with great affection. His &s;ubjects were happy under his government. He was very devout, and made a number of holy &s;ongs or p&s;alms. We have in the Bible an hundred and fifty, mo&s;tly written by him, which are called the P&s;alms of <HI>David.</HI> Some of the&s;e are penitential, that is, written when he was &s;orry for his &s;ins, and imploring or a&s;king earne&s;tly.

Some de|&s;cribe the goodne&s;s and greatne&s;s, and all the wonders of Almighty God; and others are prophetical, that is, filled with prophe|cies of what &s;hould afterwards happen.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> al&s;o collected all the riches he could get, either in gold or &s;ilver, ivory, precious &s;tones, or fine timber, and laid them by, as materials for erecting, that is, making a great temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> a temple is a magnificent building in honour

of God, &s;et apart for his &s;ervice; where the prie&s;ts &s;hould be continually attending on his wor&s;hip, and whither the people &s;hould re&s;ort to pray and offer &s;acrifices. This was what he had chiefly at heart; but it was not the divine will that the temple &s;hould be begun during <HI>David</HI>'s life-time. God was, however, graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to acquaint him, by one of his prophets, that he approved of his inten|tion, and that it &s;hould be executed, that is, done in the reign of <HI>Solomon</HI> his &s;on. In &s;hort, <HI>David</HI> reigned &s;o well, that his neighbours loved him, and God called him the man after his own heart. <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> was his chief city, and where all the men were every year to a&s;&s;emble three times, to ob&s;erve the pa&s;&s;over, and two other fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>Who would have thought that &s;uch a wi&s;e prince could ever do wrong? But the fooli&s;h plea&s;ures of the world, the riches he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the re&s;pect every body paid him, tempted him to forget his duty to God his maker, and to think too much about plea&s;ing him&s;elf: and whoever does that will &s;oon be led a&s;tray. It was ju&s;t &s;o with <HI>David;</HI> whenever he neglected &s;tudying to plea&s;e God, and began to think of plea&s;ing him&s;elf only, he fell into the greate&s;t &s;ins; but God Almighty was &s;o

good as to &s;end him great afflictions, which made him think of his &s;ins and repent. After a great deal of &s;orrow and re&s;olving to amend his life, the Almighty forgave him and ble&s;&s;ed him again. The &s;ins of <HI>David</HI> were very great indeed, but his &s;or|row for them was great too, and his pu|ni&s;hment very &s;evere, which at &s;ome time, and in &s;ome manner, is what all &s;inners mu&s;t expect. <HI>David</HI> &s;uffered great &s;ick|ne&s;s for his crimes, and met with terrible afflictions in his family. They quarrelled among them&s;elves, and <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> one of his &s;ons, rebelled again&s;t him. He al&s;o lo&s;t the love of part of his people, who cea&s;ed to re&s;pect him, when he became di&s;obe|dient to God. The greate&s;t part of them joined with <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> and made him king, and drove <HI>David</HI> out of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> his ca|pital city; but when God had &s;ufficiently humbled him, he &s;uffered <HI>Ab&s;alom'</HI>s army to be de&s;troyed, and the young man him|&s;elf lo&s;t his life. The people then returned to <HI>David</HI> their old king. He grieved a long while for his &s;on <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> and took care never to offend God any more. He lived to a great age, and governed the people well, and God to reward him, per|mitted his &s;on <HI>Solomon,</HI> though but a youth, to &s;ucceed him to the crown of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>

<HI>Q.</HI> Are the P&s;alms of <HI>David</HI> the &s;ame which we now have in the Bible?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; and many parts of them are very proper for public or private chri&s;tian wor&s;hip: but we are to remember, that it is of no u&s;e to repeat the words of a prayer or p&s;alm, unle&s;s we think, at the &s;ame time, of what we are &s;aying.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it a &s;in to divert our&s;elves, and to be cheerful?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Very far from it: God Almighty, who is goodne&s;s it&s;elf, and loves us, per|mits us to be as cheerful, and to divert our|&s;elves as well as we can, provided our diver|&s;ion or mirth is not &s;inful; that is, that it does not hurt our&s;elves or others. When it can do no harm, it is called innocent mirth; and good people always feel mirth and plea&s;ure, becau&s;e they know that God Almighty loves them, and protects them. It is, however, certainly a &s;in to employ our whole time in diver&s;ion only, becau&s;e that prevents nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s from being done.

Therefore, when he prayed for God's ble&s;|&s;ing, he a&s;ked for nothing but wi&s;dom; and the Almighty was &s;o plea&s;ed with his moderation, that he granted him the wi&s;|dom he a&s;ked for, and riches and honours be&s;ides. By means of this he was the greate&s;t king ever heard of; and to this day, when we would prai&s;e any body's

One of them is called the Proverbs of <HI>Solomon.</HI> It is full of wi&s;e &s;ayings and beautiful thoughts, very improving and entertaining. He built the temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which was a mo&s;t beautiful building. We find the de|&s;cription of it in the Holy Scriptures. <HI>Solomon</HI> al&s;o made a great palace for him|&s;elf, and &s;everal other fine buildings. And his wi&s;dom was &s;o much talked of abroad, that the queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> came from a di&s;|tant country to &s;ee him, and to admire the wonders of his country.</P>
<P>Yet, even this great and wi&s;e man went a&s;tray; with all his wi&s;dom, <HI>Solomon</HI> fell.

<P>When king <HI>Darius,</HI> who reigned after <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> had placed <HI>Daniel</HI> at the head of all his affairs, the great men of the kingdom, envying his power, and &s;eeking his ruin, craftily obtained an order from the king, which could not be changed, to forbid any prayers to be made for the &s;pace of thirty days, to any God or man what|ever, except to the king, thinking thereby to en&s;nare <HI>Daniel.</HI> But he fearing nothing, continued to pray in his u&s;ual manner,
<PB N="113" REF="028888_0116_0FDE7A4DCE04F570">
with his windows open, three times a day. This being ea&s;ily known, the&s;e wicked men took advantage of it, and accu&s;ed him to the king, who was very &s;orry to find his faithful &s;ervant in danger from his order, and laboured all he could to &s;ave him, but in vain, and was forced to command him to be ca&s;t into the den of lions.</P>
<P>The king pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;adne&s;s and &s;olitude, neither were any in&s;truments of mu&s;ic brought before him, and his &s;leep went from him. And he aro&s;e very early in the morning, and went in ha&s;te unto the den of lions. And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto <HI>Daniel,</HI> and the king &s;poke and &s;aid unto him; O <HI>Daniel,</HI> &s;ervant of the living God, is thy God whom thou &s;erve&s;t continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? Then &s;aid <HI>Daniel</HI> unto the king; O king live for ever (this was an u&s;ual manner of &s;peaking to kings in tho&s;e days.) My God hath &s;ent his angel, and hath &s;hut the lions' mouths: fora&s;much as before him innocency was found in me; and al&s;o before thee, O king, I have done no hurt. Then the king was exceeding glad, and commanded <HI>Daniel</HI> to be taken out of the den, and the men that accu&s;ed him to be brought and ca&s;t into it; over whom the lions had the ma&s;tery, and broke all
<PB N="114" REF="028888_0117_0FDE7A546EF0C8E0">
their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why would not <HI>Shadrach, Me&s;hach,</HI> and <HI>Abednego</HI> wor&s;hip <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s image?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e it was forbidden them by the fir&s;t and &s;econd commandments.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Ought not we to be ready to &s;uffer any thing, rather than go again&s;t our con|&s;ciences, and wor&s;hip any other than God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: becau&s;e God can deliver us out of the greate&s;t dangers, as he did the&s;e men. If not, he can make us happy in another world.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But might not <HI>Daniel</HI> have forborne to wor&s;hip God for thirty days in the pub|lic manner he was known to do, and have contented him&s;elf with praying to him in &s;ecret, rather than di&s;obey the laws, and expo&s;e him&s;elf to be devoured by wild bea&s;ts?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By no means: for that would have been to act deceitfully, and would have appeared to be a forbearing to wor&s;hip God at the command of a king. Whereas on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and at all proper times, we are to make open profe&s;&s;ion of our re|ligion, without fear of man.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF THE BOOK OF JOB.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now given an account of mo&s;t of that part of the Bible which is called the Old Te&s;tament, except the Book of <HI>Job.</HI> It contains the life of that good man, and is one of the fine&s;t hi&s;tories in the Holy Scripture. It is not known what time he lived; but he is mentioned as a pattern of goodne&s;s, patience, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God. No man ever underwent harder trials; for he was deprived of all his fortune, his friends,
<PB N="118" REF="028888_0121_0FDE7A6F3B029CF8">
and his children, and endured the mo&s;t painful &s;ickne&s;s; but all this &s;erved to &s;hew his great dependence upon God, and his humility, and that no extremity of &s;ufferings could tempt him to do evil. When <HI>Job</HI>'s piety had been &s;ufficiently manife&s;ted, God Almighty re&s;tored to him all he had lo&s;t, fortune, friends, children, and health; and added a great deal more, &s;o that the latter end of his life was &s;till more pro&s;perous than the beginning had been.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE LIFE OF OUR SAVIOUR.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was born in the country of the <HI>Jews,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>Au|gu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI> was emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI> and in the time of a general peace. The parti|cular
<PB N="119" REF="028888_0122_0FDE7A7411A43088">
circum&s;tances that attended his birth are related in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Soon after he was born, &s;ome wi&s;e men from the ea&s;tern country, where the ex|pectation of the Me&s;&s;iah was general, hav|ing been informed by the appearance of an extraordinary &s;tar, of that happy event, came into <HI>Judea,</HI> to pay homage to him. <HI>Herod,</HI> whom the <HI>Romans</HI> had &s;et over the land of <HI>Judah,</HI> was much alarmed at the news; for mi&s;taking in common with the re&s;t of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people, the true cha|racter of the Me&s;&s;iah, he feared that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> would be rai&s;ed to the throne in his place.</P>
<P>This bad man, therefore, tried to find out the child, with an intention to de&s;troy him; but <HI>Mary,</HI> the mother of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> her hu&s;band, were &s;o poor and &s;o little known, that he could not di&s;cover him. Then cruel <HI>Herod,</HI> in order to make &s;ure of him, commanded all the infants to be put to death, who were in or about <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> where it was foretold that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould be born. But God di&s;covered his wicked intention to <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in a dream, de&s;iring him to make ha&s;te, and take the child and his mother into <HI>Egypt.</HI> They went and &s;taid there, till God again in|formed him by another dream, that <HI>Herod</HI> was dead, and commanded him to return
<PB N="120" REF="028888_0123_0FDE7A7A3306BE80">
home, but to go to <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and not to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> for fear of <HI>Herod</HI>'s &s;on, who then reigned, and who was as cruel as his father.</P>
<P>When <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was but twelve years old, he a&s;toni&s;hed all who &s;aw or heard him, by the extraordinary wi&s;dom he di&s;played. But before he made any appearance as a prophet, <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t was &s;ent out by God Almighty, to prepare people's minds for the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, and he en|couraged and endeavoured to per&s;uade every body to repent, and al&s;o to be bap|tized; a ceremony by which they pub|licly expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire of becoming the di&s;ciples of the Me&s;&s;iah, acknowledg|ing that repentance was nece&s;&s;ary in order to their becoming &s;uch, and their belief that <HI>John</HI> was divinely commi&s;&s;ioned to prepare men for his reception.</P>
<P>When our Lord was about thirty years old, he began to act him&s;elf &s;uitably to the intentions of his coming. Fir&s;t of all, he was baptized by <HI>John,</HI> at which time the Holy Spirit of God, in a particular manner, came down upon him. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was after this put under a very &s;ingular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to exerci&s;e him before-hand, and to fit him for his great office of Teacher and Sa|viour of a &s;inful world; and he fa&s;ted forty days, all which time was &s;pent in
<PB N="121" REF="028888_0124_0FDE7A80814C5A08">
holy meditation and prayer, and receiving divine in&s;truction and direction. When this was ended, he began to call upon the people to repent and amend their lives. He went up into a mountain, and deli|vered &s;ome of the mo&s;t excellent di&s;cour&s;es, or &s;ermons, that ever were heard. In the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es he taught that which we call the Lord's Prayer, as a pattern for all ad|dre&s;&s;es or prayers to Almighty God. He teaches us al&s;o that we mu&s;t be humble, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, patient, and good-natured; in &s;hort, that we mu&s;t neither do nor &s;ay, nor even think any thing that is wrong, and that we mu&s;t &s;tudy to do kindne&s;s, even to our greate&s;t enemies. For by &s;o doing we imitate God him&s;elf, who is kind to the di&s;obedient, as well as the pious and obedient; who &s;ends no afflic|tions but to make us better, or to keep us good; and who permits the enlivening &s;un&s;hine, and refre&s;hing &s;howers, to vi&s;it the good and bad alike.</P>
<P>When our Saviour came down from the mount, he practi&s;ed all he had been preaching; for he went about doing good, and u&s;ing the great power which he had received from God for the benefit of men. He cured di&s;tempers of all kinds by a word, or a &s;ingle touch. He made the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, the blind
<PB N="122" REF="028888_0125_0FDE7A8686CA0980">
to &s;ee, the dumb to &s;peak, and rai&s;ed the dead to life. In one in&s;tance there was &s;uch virtue accompanying him, that a di&s;tempered per&s;on who touched his clothes, in hopes of being cured, was im|mediately well; and though he had no lands or money, he twice &s;atisfied the hunger of &s;everal thou&s;ands with a few loaves and fi&s;hes. The hi&s;tory of his rai&s;ing <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the dead, and the whole account of that family, gives us a mo&s;t plea&s;ing picture of tenderne&s;s, hu|manity, and friend&s;hip. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, not content with doing what good he could per&s;onally, or by him&s;elf, cho&s;e twelve from among his di&s;ciples to be con&s;tantly with him; he particularly in|&s;tructed them, and after they had been enabled by Almighty God to work mira|cles, he commanded them to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves about to in&s;truct, that is, to teach the ignorant, as he did, and to re|lieve every kind of di&s;tre&s;s. He told them they would frequently meet with very bad u&s;age, but that they ought to &s;ubmit pa|tiently for his &s;ake; that what they &s;uf|fered was in the &s;ervice of God, for the good of mankind, and for their endea|vours to teach truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s: and that if we live in this world in ever
<PB N="123" REF="028888_0126_0FDE7A8BE75D83C0">
&s;o inoffen&s;ive, or even u&s;eful a manner, we may &s;till have &s;ome enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Were not all men delighted with &s;o great, and good, and amiable a character, and did they not do every thing in their power to &s;hew their love and re&s;pect for him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, indeed they did not, a very few per&s;ons excepted.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How could this happen; one would think that every body would be almo&s;t ready to lay down his life for &s;uch a per|&s;on?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> One would think &s;o; and this would have been the ca&s;e, had not the people of the <HI>Jews</HI> been at that time very wicked, having their minds poi&s;oned by many bad pa&s;&s;ions; in particular they were proud, conceited, and ambitious; that is, wi&s;hed to make them&s;elves great and powerful, at the expen&s;e of the happine&s;s of other people; when, therefore, they found that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> would not gratify them by taking to him&s;elf any worldly grandeur, they were &s;o di&s;appointed and offended, that they were ea&s;ily prevailed upon by their rulers, and particularly by the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> to &s;eek his de&s;truction.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us,</HI> however, &s;till went on teaching his di&s;ciples and the people every thing that was u&s;eful for them to know. He
<PB N="124" REF="028888_0127_0FDE7A93101F5990">
told them al&s;o a great deal be&s;ides, that would come to pa&s;s afterwards; &s;uch as the nature of his death and &s;ufferings, of the time and manner of his &s;econd coming, of the life of men after death, and of their reward or puni&s;hment, according as they had been good or bad. Some things in his teaching he delivered in &s;hort hints and &s;triking &s;tories, called parables, which, if they were not quite &s;o ea&s;y to be under|&s;tood, were le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to &s;ome who heard him, and likely to be remembered by them, till they became better di&s;po&s;ed to receive the in&s;truction that was con|tained in them. What he &s;aid at &s;ome times darkly, at other times he delivered more clearly, and he explained all things to tho&s;e di&s;ciples who were very much with him. And in one way or other, he has abundantly furni&s;hed us with all things nece&s;&s;ary to lead us to the knowledge of our duty, and to excite us to the practice of our duty; to help us to avoid and to overcome temptation, and to &s;upport and comfort us in difficulties and afflictions.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> know that he &s;hould &s;uffer a very painful and cruel death, and did his di&s;ciples know it?</P>
<P><HI>A. Je&s;us</HI> knew it from the fir&s;t, but it did not at all abate, that is, le&s;&s;en his zeal in the great work in which he was en|gaged;
<PB N="125" REF="028888_0128_0FDE7A9A7B42CE90">
and he often foretold, even the circum&s;tances of his death to his di&s;ciples; but although they were hone&s;t well-mean|ing men, they were led away by the gene|ral mi&s;take, that the Me&s;&s;iah was to be a great temporal prince.</P>
<P>Our Saviour's words and di&s;cour&s;es a&s;to|ni&s;hed every body. Numbers of the peo|ple admired and followed him; but the prie&s;ts, the &s;cribes, the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> and <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees,</HI> were again&s;t him from envy and jea|lou&s;y. The&s;e la&s;t were hypocrites, who pretended to be wi&s;er and better than other men, but were full of pride and deceit. Such men always hate tho&s;e who are truly good, e&s;pecially when they find they are better liked than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>They therefore per&s;ecuted our Lord, and tried to puzzle him with artful que&s;tions, and to draw him in to &s;ay or do &s;omething contrary to law, in order to have a pretence for putting him to death. But he &s;hewed him&s;elf as much above them in wi&s;dom as in virtue, and often &s;ent them away con|founded at the wi&s;dom and prudence of his an&s;wers.</P>
<P>Their malice grew to a great height, and they per&s;uaded many to unite with them; our Saviour knew they would &s;oon obtain their wi&s;h; and he knew that he was &s;ent into the world, not only to do good
<PB N="126" REF="028888_0129_0FDE7A9F1E22A920">
by his miracles and di&s;cour&s;es, but al&s;o to do good by the violent and public death which he was to undergo. By this death the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions (that is, his truth in re&s;pect of what he had told them) his obedience to God's will, his confidence in his heavenly Father, and his own belief in a future life and recompen&s;e to the good were to be proved: by this death al&s;o, his di&s;ciples were to be encouraged and pre|pared to endure all things in the mini&s;try to which they were appointed: by this death al&s;o, a clear proof was to be given of his love to all per&s;ons; and la&s;tly, his death was to be followed by his re&s;urrection from the grave. That re&s;urrection would be a proof that his followers will not peri&s;h when they die. For this violent and public death, therefore, a very awful, though very u&s;eful event, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> carefully prepared both him&s;elf and his di&s;ciples.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who were the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Sadducees?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Lawyers</HI> were per|&s;ons, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be learned in expounding or explaining the law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Sadducees</HI> were two &s;ects of men among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> who held very different opinions indeed; yet as they had all of them private ambitious ends of their own to an&s;wer, and were worldly-minded
<PB N="127" REF="028888_0130_0FDE7AA54B185CD0">
and covetous, they agreed in per|&s;ecuting and condemning <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e ex|cellent doctrine and holy life, were equally a reproach to them both. The <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> were men of learning, and pretended to un|common holine&s;s; but their religion con|&s;i&s;ted chiefly in the ob&s;ervance of rites or certain forms, and ceremonies, for which they &s;ought to be admired of men, whil&s;t they neglected the weightier matters of the law, which are judgment, mercy, and faith. The <HI>Sadducees</HI> di&s;believed a future life after death.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What were the di&s;po&s;itions of mind that made the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> pretend to be what they were not, or be &s;uch hypocrites?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Vanity (that is, the love of admira|tion) covetou&s;ne&s;s (by which is meant the love of money) and ambition (by which is meant the love of power) and when any of the&s;e vices get root in the mind, they op|po&s;e them&s;elves to every thing really excel|lent, they mi&s;lead the judgment, make the heart bad, and are very hateful in the &s;ight of God. To per&s;ons of &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, the deep humility, the perfect kindne&s;s, and the univer&s;al goodne&s;s of our Lord, could not but be very di&s;plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>On the night that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was to fall into the hands of his enemies, he &s;at down to &s;upper with his di&s;ciples, and acquainted
<PB N="128" REF="028888_0131_0FDE7AAB1DDC41B0">
them that one of that company would be|tray him; and hinted that <HI>Judas I&s;cariot</HI> was the man. After &s;upper he brake bread and ble&s;&s;ed God for it, and gave &s;ome to each of them, &s;aying, <HI>Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for many. Eat this in re|membrance of me.</HI> He al&s;o took the cup of wine, and gave it to them, &s;aying, <HI>This is my blood which is &s;hed for many. Drink this in remembrance of me.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after &s;upper, tho&s;e to whom <HI>Judas</HI> had betrayed his Ma&s;ter, came and &s;eized upon him and carried him away.</P>
<P>As to the manner of his examination before <HI>Pilate,</HI> his crucifixion, his re&s;urrec|tion, his appearance to his di&s;ciples after his burial, and his a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven: it is &s;o finely related by the &s;acred writers of that part of the Holy Bible, called the New Te&s;tament, that we cannot do better in this re&s;pect than to read it over frequently, and with attention.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> To be poor in &s;pirit &s;ignifies to be humble-minded, to be of a quiet teachable di&s;po&s;ition, not to think highly of our&s;elves, or to indulge a violent or &s;tubborn temper, but to be contented with our &s;ituation what|ever it may be. The&s;e are the poor in &s;pirit, and to the&s;e the kingdom of heaven is promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next ble&s;&s;ing is to them that mourn, promi&s;ing that they &s;hall be comforted.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does this mean?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It means, perhaps, that tho&s;e &s;hall be comforted who mourn, or are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, from a &s;en&s;e that they have done wrong, and who are &s;incerely de&s;irous of doing right in future, or who are &s;orry for the weakne&s;&s;es and faults of others: this is a very proper and affectionate temper, and will always be attended with great comfort, and &s;atisfaction in the mind.</P>
<P>The third ble&s;&s;ing is to the meek, with this promi&s;e, that they &s;hall inherit the earth.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does this mean?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The meek are tho&s;e of a quiet and gentle di&s;po&s;ition, who are not di&s;po&s;ed to be quarrel&s;ome and angry, but to forgive.
<PB N="130" REF="028888_0133_0FDE7AB54D9A50A8">
The&s;e are the people who pa&s;s through life mo&s;t comfortably, by not re&s;enting little offences, they avoid making any enemies; by a gentle and kind behaviour, they make many friends; and &s;o they may be &s;aid to inherit the earth.&mdash;Whil&s;t tho&s;e who are of a quarrel&s;ome temper, make every body about them unhappy, and are unhappy them&s;elves: if they are rich they have no comfort in their riches, becau&s;e they are mi&s;erable in their own minds: and if they are poor, nobody &s;carcely will help them, becau&s;e they have made them&s;elves di&s;liked.</P>
<P>The fourth ble&s;&s;ing is to tho&s;e who hun|ger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it is promi&s;ed to them that they &s;hall be filled.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Pray what are we to under&s;tand by this?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;|ne&s;s, means an earne&s;t and con&s;tant de&s;ire to be righteous, that is, to be good: and God has graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed that tho&s;e who hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, they &s;hall be filled (that is, they &s;hall be|come good) let us therefore always, and with all our might, &s;trive to leave undone tho&s;e things which we ought not to do, and to do tho&s;e things that we ought to do; firmly believing that God will help us when we endeavour; and that in time, we
<PB N="131" REF="028888_0134_0FDE7ABA7A5F0DE0">
&s;hall become as perfect as we have endea|voured to become.</P>
<P>The fifth is, <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful, for they &s;hall obtain mercy.</Q></P>
<P>By this ble&s;&s;ing we are encouraged to &s;hew a kind, affectionate, and forgiving temper. It is the &s;ure&s;t method of gaining us the love and good will of men; he who is cruel and unkind, who &s;peaks ill, and behaves har&s;hly to others, &s;eldom meets with compa&s;&s;ion when he falls into di&s;tre&s;s: and the recollection of his own cruelty, mu&s;t make him very unhappy.&mdash;But every body pities, and many endeavour to re|lieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a kind and merciful man, &s;o that he often obtains mercy even in this world, and he is &s;ure (which is much better) to obtain it in the world to come.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth promi&s;es to the pure in heart, that they &s;hall &s;ee God.</P>
<P>From this ble&s;&s;ing, we &s;ee it not only nece&s;&s;ary to avoid doing wrong, or &s;aying any thing wrong, but that we mu&s;t endea|vour to keep the heart pure from every bad wi&s;h, for all evil begins either in our thoughts, or our de&s;ires; and we-find that in order to &s;ee God, and to be happy in the next world, we mu&s;t keep our hearts pure in this.&mdash;Let us then &s;hun every ap|pearance

of evil, and conquer every bad wi&s;h or thought in the beginning.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh ble&s;&s;ing declares, that the peace-makers &s;hall be called the children of God.</P>
<P>From this we &s;hould learn not only to avoid a quarrel&s;ome temper our&s;elves, but endeavour as much as po&s;&s;ible to hinder, and to reconcile any quarrels among&s;t our friends and neighbours. Tho&s;e then who go about telling tales, and making mi&s;chief among&s;t their neighbours, we may be &s;ure are di&s;plea&s;ing to God, &s;ince it is the peace-makers who &s;hall be called the children of God.</P>
<P>In the eighth, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <Q>ble&s;&s;ed are they who are per&s;ecuted for right|eou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, for their's is the kingdom of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>In former times many people were per|&s;ecuted, that is, they were puni&s;hed, and of|ten put to death, for &s;peaking and doing what they believed to be right, to them <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has promi&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ing of the king|dom of heaven.</P>
<P>And in the next ble&s;&s;ing, which is very much like it, he &s;ays, <Q>ble&s;&s;ed are ye when men &s;hall revile you, and per&s;ecute you, and &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you <HI>fal&s;ely,</HI> for my &s;ake; rejoice, and be ex|ceedingly
<PB N="133" REF="028888_0136_0FDE7AC522C01670">
glad, for great will be your reward in heaven.</Q></P>
<P>Now, though in this country, no people are put to death for their religion, yet there are many thoughtle&s;s and wicked people, who are apt to make a je&s;t of every thing &s;erious, who not being good them&s;elves, laugh at others for &s;aying their prayers, going regularly to wor&s;hip, and being &s;o|ber, and mild, and peaceable, and reli|gious. But do not let &s;uch treatment di&s;|courage you, but, on the contrary, let it en|courage you&mdash;for remember&mdash;that great will be your reward in heaven.</P>
<P>In another part of his &s;ermon, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> re|commends them, to be patterns of good|ne&s;s and piety, that others &s;eeing their good works, may glorify their father who is in heaven.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have opportunities of read|ing this excellent &s;ermon, and of learning their duty to God, and to mankind, &s;hould attend to this, and endeavour to be &s;uch patterns of goodne&s;s, that others may fol|low their example.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> farther tells them, that by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> law, murder and adultery are forbidden; and that tho&s;e who are guilty of the&s;e crimes, are liable to judgment, and to be puni&s;hed: and at the &s;ame time, propo&s;es a much higher virtue or goodne&s;s,
<PB N="134" REF="028888_0137_0FDE7ACADFCA9878">
for he tells us, that we mu&s;t guard again&s;t every thought, or wi&s;h, or temper, that would lead us to do wrong; and that, <Q>who&s;oever is angry with his brother without a cau&s;e,</Q> does wrong in the &s;ight of God, and is in danger of puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<Q>Therefore, if thou bring thy gift be|fore the altar, and there remembere&s;t that thy brother hath ought again&s;t thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, fir&s;t go and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</Q>
<P>From hence we may learn, that God re|quires of us before we attempt to wor&s;hip him, to be reconciled to all men (for we &s;hould in this &s;en&s;e con&s;ider all men as our brothers.) If, therefore, we would wi&s;h that God &s;hould li&s;ten to us, forgive us our faults, and love us, we mu&s;t be kind and forgiving to others, and make them amends for any harm we have done them, before God will hear us. And if we &s;hould find that any plea&s;ure, or any temper, or habit, that is ever &s;o natural and agreeable, and &s;eemingly almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to us, &s;hould prove hurtful in making us le&s;s good; however dear it may be, we mu&s;t get rid of it, if we would be happy in heaven, though it &s;hould be as dear to us as a right hand, or a right eye.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="028888_0138_0FDE7AD0ABA9D370">
Again <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <Q>ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid, thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy&s;elf, but &s;hall perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I &s;ay unto you, &s;wear not at all, &amp;c. but let your communica|tion be yea yea, and nay nay, for what|&s;oever is more than that cometh of evil.</Q></P>
<P>By this we are to under&s;tand, that upon every occa&s;ion we &s;hould mo&s;t carefully tell the truth, and not take the name of God in vain, or &s;peak lightly of &s;erious things: for when we are &s;trictly good, and &s;trictly ju&s;t, we &s;hall upon every oc|ca&s;ion be as much &s;hocked at telling a fal&s;ehood, as a bad man can be at &s;wear|ing fal&s;ely, for which the laws have pro|vided a puni&s;hment here, and God will puni&s;h hereafter. Let us therefore never &s;wear, but be &s;imple and &s;incere in our di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, in this &s;ermon, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> adds, <Q>I &s;ay unto you, re&s;i&s;t not evil; but who|&s;oever &s;hall &s;mite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o.

<P>Here <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> recommends that we &s;hould not re&s;ent, or be angry at injuries or af|fronts,
<PB N="136" REF="028888_0139_0FDE7AD5F4433620">
but that we &s;hould forgive them: this meekne&s;s is &s;o far from being a proof of a mean and low di&s;po&s;ition, that it is a &s;trong proof of a great, a good, and chri&s;|tian temper. Be&s;ides this, it is really the mo&s;t wi&s;e, for it is the way to make our enemies our friends; it will make us happy in our own minds, and procure us the favor of God; and it is better to put up with many little injuries, rather than to go to law, which not only makes men unhappy in them&s;elves, but often brings them to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <Q>Give to him that a&s;keth thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away.</Q></P>
<P>If you have it not in your power to give money, you may give advice, and lend your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. You are taught by this to do every good and kind action in your power.</P>
<Q><P>Again, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> adds, I &s;ay unto you, love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who de&s;pitefully u&s;e you, and per&s;ecute you: that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, for he makes the &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good, and &s;end|eth rain on the ju&s;t and on the unju&s;t.</P>

<P>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be &s;een of them, other|wi&s;e ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. But when thou doe&s;t thine alms, let thine alms be in &s;ecret, and thine heavenly Father who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, him&s;elf &s;hall reward thee openly.</P></Q>
<P>The meaning of this is, that when we do charitable actions, we &s;hould do them from a kind and merciful di&s;po&s;ition, and becau&s;e all mankind are our brethren; (and to relieve and a&s;&s;i&s;t our brethren, is plea&s;ing to God) now if we do good for the&s;e rea&s;ons, we &s;hall not want the prai&s;e of men, and God, who &s;ees in &s;ecret&punc; will reward us openly in the other world.</P>

<P>And as we are directed to pray that we may not be led into temptation, it will be wi&s;e in us not to expo&s;e our&s;elves to it, but to avoid every thing that is likely to lead us to do wrong, e&s;pecially tho&s;e tempta|tions to which we are mo&s;t likely to give way.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF THE APOSTLES.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the books of the four evan|geli&s;ts, <HI>Matthew, Mark, Luke</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> we find a book called, <HI>The Acts of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> in which there is &s;ome account of what became of them after their Lord had left them. As for poor wicked <HI>Judas,</HI> his guilty con&s;cience drove him to &s;uch de&s;pair, that he hanged him&s;elf.&mdash;It is thus that one &s;in generally leads to an|other. But &s;elf-murder could only add to the crime he had before committed. We have no right to take away the life that God has given, whether other peo|ple's, or our own. We may repent of other &s;ins, after having been guilty of them. There are, however, very few people, if any, who are not out of their minds, that attempt to commit &s;uch a crime. The other apo&s;tles, or di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> did in obedience to God's com|mands, go about preaching the go&s;pel, and doing good works. We read, that they very &s;oon, according to the promi&s;e of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> were enabled by the power of God to &s;peak many languages which they
<PB N="143" REF="028888_0146_0FDE7AFADE03CEB0">
had never learnt, to work miracles like tho&s;e of their Ma&s;ter, and to conduct them|&s;elves on very difficult occa&s;ions, with extraodinary fortitude and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>They almo&s;t all died martyrs to the faith; that is, were put to cruel deaths, by barbarous men, becau&s;e they would per&s;i&s;t in &s;peaking the truth, which they had re|ceived from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and witne&s;&s;ing what they had &s;een and known relating to him.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the author of many epi&s;tles, or letters, which compo&s;e a part of the New Te&s;tament, had not been originally a di&s;|ciple of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but had been a <HI>Jew,</HI> and per&s;ecuted the church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> that is, the a&s;&s;embly of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> there. God however, was plea&s;ed to convert him at la&s;t from his errors, and he became a good Chri&s;tian, and a zealous Apo&s;tle. St. <HI>Pe|ter,</HI> and the other apo&s;tles, &s;eemed to con|fine them&s;elves chiefly to the conver&s;ion of the <HI>Jews:</HI> but St. <HI>Paul</HI> worked upon a larger plan, for he adre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the heathens al&s;o, and converted an infinite number of them. He went twice to <HI>Rome,</HI> and preached the go&s;pel there. St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> were great friends and fellow-labourers in the work to which they were appointed. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> before he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> wrote a long letter to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and by the knowledge of the go&s;pel re|vealed
<PB N="144" REF="028888_0147_0FDE7B00503765D0">
to him, he tells them what they were to believe and to do.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Peter</HI> wrote two epi&s;tles, which are directed to all the &s;trangers, new Chri&s;|tians, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> &s;cattered about <HI>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Bithynia;</HI> who by rea&s;on of their af|flicted and per&s;ecuted &s;tate, might be called &s;trangers upon earth.</P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI> al&s;o wrote three epi&s;tles, one to the univer&s;al Church; that is, the general &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians all over the world, and the other two to particular &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>We have, be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;ome other Epi&s;tles, written by different Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>The la&s;t book in the New Te&s;tament, is the Revelation of St. <HI>John,</HI> which is written in &s;o &s;ublime and figurative a &s;tyle, and altogether prophetic, or fore|telling things to come, that the learned only are capable of &s;earching into its meaning; and common readers need not perplex them&s;elves at all about it. Let us therefore content our&s;elves like St. <HI>Paul,</HI> with the knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> crucified; and let us aim at nothing el&s;e &s;o much, as imitating his virtuous and amiable life.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the&s;e Epi&s;tles is to fix upon the mind a &s;erious belief in the truths of chri&s;tianity, and to per&s;uade men to the practice of every virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="028888_0148_0FDD22CD72D8EFF0">
<HI>Q.</HI> What is the meaning of the word Te&s;tament?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Te&s;tament means the &s;ame as cove|nant or agreement, which always &s;uppo&s;es two parties. Thus Almighty God was plea&s;ed in ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;eperate <HI>Abra|ham</HI> from his own family and kindred, and to promi&s;e him, that as a reward of his faith and obedience, his de&s;cendants &s;hould obtain the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> who were to continue to po&s;&s;e&s;s it in pro&s;perity and peace &s;o long as they obeyed the law that &s;hould be given to them by <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>This, therefore, on the part of God, was conditional, and only to be performed in con&s;equence of obedience to his laws on the part of <HI>Abraham</HI> and his po&s;terity: hence the former part of the &s;acred hi&s;|tory, although it contains a great variety of other matters, is called by the name of the Old Te&s;tament, or Covenant.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do we know any thing of what might be the further de&s;ign of God in thus di&s;|tingui&s;hing one particular family?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This di&s;pen&s;ation re&s;pecting <HI>Abraham</HI> was a principal means of&punc; pre&s;erving the knowledge of the one living and true God in the world, and of preparing the way, and providing evidence for the go&s;pel; and thus <HI>Abraham</HI> became the happy in|&s;trument

of the greate&s;t benefit and ble&s;|&s;ing to many others.</P>
<P>The latter part of the &s;acred hi&s;tory re|fers to the promi&s;es of God made by our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> of a future happy and never-ending life after death, if we on our part are careful to ob&s;erve and to do whatever he has commanded us, and this is called the New Te&s;tament, or Cove|nant.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Will our being called Chri&s;tians, and having been baptized, or the holding any particular opinions, entitle us to be heirs of his promi&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No indeed, not any of the&s;e things if we do not lead holy and exemplary lives. <Q>Ye are my friends, when you do what|&s;oever I command you.&mdash;If any man have not the &s;pirit of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he is none of his.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What were the principal things which our Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> came into the world to teach men?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He was &s;ent to teach us, that if we do indeed purify our&s;elves from all &s;in and iniquity, and faithfully and &s;teadily endea|vour as our fir&s;t pur&s;uit to obtain the favour of God by obeying his laws, that then our heavenly Father, of his own free mercy and goodne&s;s, will forgive our pa&s;t offences, receive us into his favour, and admit us to

the glorious privilege of being called his children: and that although we mu&s;t, in this world of trial, expect &s;ome di&s;&s;appoint|ments, yet if we per&s;evere to the end, in the exerci&s;e of all chri&s;tian di&s;po&s;itions, and the practice of all chri&s;tian duties, we may be certain that God will never for&s;ake us; and that after death, he will rai&s;e us up again to a life of glory and happine&s;s, which will never end.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the true character of a chri&s;tian? Is every body a chri&s;tian who reads the hi&s;tory of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and who believes all that is written in the New Te&s;tament concerning him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To be a chri&s;tian, it is nece&s;&s;ary not only to read, and believe the hi&s;tory of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> we mu&s;t endeavour al&s;o to be|come like him in di&s;po&s;ition and conduct; always avoiding pride, and being careful never de&s;pi&s;e another, for <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was of a meek and humble &s;pirit; and as he was the friend and teacher of mankind, his true follower will endeavour like him, always to a&s;&s;i&s;t and be kind to others; the chri&s;tian who is not ble&s;t with riches, to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, will yet pity their &s;ufferings&mdash;help them in their labours&mdash;reform the wicked, and &s;et forth by his conver&s;ation and example, the com|forts and advantages of a devout and holy

life; thankful for all worldly ble&s;&s;ings, that providence hath &s;et within the reach of virtuous indu&s;try, he takes them that he may u&s;e them for others, as well as for him&s;elf; remembering that of all his powers, and of all his talents, he is to render an account. His heart, however, is not &s;et on external ble&s;&s;ings; he &s;eeks a better portion both for him&s;elf&punc; and for all who are within his influence. True Goodne&s;s always meets with whatever &s;upport and encouragement he can give it, and while he abhors the vices of the wicked, he pities them, that would reclaim them. The love of goodne&s;s di&s;po&s;es him to a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e who are good.</P>
<P>The word of God is his delight, and his coun&s;ellor; his day is always welcome to him, and he loves the habitation of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The true chri&s;tian although he weep with tho&s;e who weep, will yet be enabled to &s;upport his own &s;orrows without murmur|ing; always &s;aying in his heart, "thy will oh Lord! not mine be done;" and ever bearing in mind the calmne&s;s and mode|ration of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> towards his enemies, he al&s;o will endeavour to &s;uffer even in&s;ults, reviling, and ill u&s;age with patience, and a compo&s;ed mind; and as the true chri&s;tian will make choice of every means to advance

The true chri&s;tian will frequently examine his own character, and endeavour to correct every thought, and word, and action, that may appear contrary to the&s;e doctrines; and in&s;tead of encouraging anger, hatred, re|venge, di&s;hone&s;ty, intemperance, deceit|fulne&s;s, &s;wearing, or fal&s;ehood, he will en|deavour, on the contrary, to plea&s;e God, by following the in&s;tructions of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which teach us to live peaceably with all men, to forgive our enemies, and to aviod every evil di&s;po&s;ition, or wicked practice, which might lead us to forget God, to in|jure another, or to love this world better than that which is to come. The true chri&s;tian, therefore, loving God with all his heart, and always doing to others that which he would wi&s;h that others &s;hould do to him, according to the example and go&s;|pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> will lead a life of peace, al|ways remembering in poverty, and &s;ick|ne&s;s, and every di&s;tre&s;s, that the&s;e afflic|tions can la&s;t but for a &s;ea&s;on, and that every day he approaches nearer towards that time, when God &s;hall admit him into

With the&s;e joyful expectations; the true chri&s;tian will find comfort under all his &s;ufferings, and when at length through temptation, trials, and tribulation, he &s;hall be &s;ufficiently prepared for another, and a better life, he will then be enabled to meet death with a compo&s;ed mind, and to &s;ay with <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> in his la&s;t hour, <Q>I have glorified thee on earth, and now, Oh Father! glorify thou me.</Q></P>
<P>This it is to be a true chri&s;tian.</P>
