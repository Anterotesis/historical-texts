<HEAD>The Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not &s;ingularity or O&s;tentation that I appear in Print, but my Chri&s;tian Duty, in Honour to God, and the Salvation and well being of the &s;ouls of men, in the De|tection of the Anti-chri&s;tian Practice in <HI>making Slaves</HI> of them who bear the Image of God, <HI>viz.</HI> their fellow, Creature, Man; A Practice &s;o <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>inhumane,</HI> that the more it is thought upon by judicious men, the more they do abhor it; It being &s;o vile a contradiction to the Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>And if our Negro-Ma&s;ters were put to it, to bring an In&s;tance that a man denyed the Chri&s;tian Faith, I think they could not bring a &s;tronger In&s;tance, then that he was found in the Practice of making Slaves of men. And furthermore, I doubt not, but this may be to &s;ome a very unwelcome Theam, and they would wonder to find their beloved <HI>Deti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ah,</HI> the making Slaves of Negros, and others rejected, although the more moderate Chri&s;tians do full well know, that. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

the Truth on my &s;ide. And if the&s;e Lines &s;hould come to the <HI>I&s;land of Great Britain</HI> (my native I and) I hope the &s;incere Chri|&s;tians there of all Sects will commend my Chri&s;tian care, in detecting &s;o gro&s;s a cor|ruption as this, crept in by rea&s;on of the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e and Gains it brings to our <HI>American Chri|&s;tians;</HI> And I hope the <HI>learned Chri&s;tians</HI> there will admoni&s;h their <HI>American Brethren,</HI> for putting &s;uch an Affront upon the ever ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and his glorious Go&s;pel as this their Practice doth, in making Slaves of Men.</P>
<P>This Practice cannot but be very offen&s;ive to &s;incere and hone&s;t hearted Chri&s;tians, that this Practie &s;hould be heard among the Heathen, to harden them in &s;uch <HI>heatheni&s;h Practices.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Reader,</HI> I am going to &s;hew thee a Wonder, and that is, this thirty years that <HI>I</HI> have been in <HI>America,</HI> this Pra|ctice has been carried on almo&s;t in profound &s;ilence, which it is like the Negro-Ma&s;ters will take it the harder to be oppo&s;ed now. It is true, <HI>John Tillot&s;on</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> hath two Sermons in print concerning <HI>Re&s;titution,</HI> and he tells them there, that <HI>they cannot have Admittance into Heaven without making Restitution of the wrong done to there fellow

Creatures.</HI> And if this be applyed to the wrong done to Negroes, I have Bi&s;hop <HI>Til|lot&s;on</HI> on my &s;ide. This and many other excellent things have dropt from the Pen of that (in many things, no doubt, an) excel|lent man.</P>
<P>And <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> calls the In&s;laving of Negroes, <HI>A crying Sin in the Land.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And George Fox</HI> printed again&s;t this Pra|ctice, and &s;ent it to the <HI>Barbadoes-Quakers.</HI> Such was the early care of this excellent man above forty years ago; But his Chri|&s;tian Admonition was rejected. It is true, there are &s;ome excellent &s;ouls among them &s;till, who came out of <HI>Old England,</HI> that have kept their Integrity, namely <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Thomas Chalkley,</HI> and others, who when they &s;ee this Abomination acted by their <HI>American Brethren,</HI> they openly bear Te&s;timony in their publick A&s;&s;emblies, and declare again&s;t it (as I am credibly informed) There was another Paper Printed by (I think) <HI>G.

<P>THe more a Man becomes confor|mable to the Attributes of God, the more ju&s;t and holy he is, and the more beloved of God, and con&s;equent|ly a more perfect Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> then, God hath given to man a Free|Will, &s;o that he is Ma&s;ter of his own Choice (whether it be good or evil) and will in no way force and compel the Will of man; yea, not unto that part which is good, far le&s;s unto evil, notwith&s;tanding his Attribute of Omnipotence. And &s;eeing then, it is thus with God and his Creatures, we ought al&s;o to do &s;o by our fellow mortals, and therefore we ought not to force and compel our fellow creatures, the Negroes, Nay, not although we judge it for them a bet|ter way of living; For when we force their will, this is a manife&s;t Robbery of that noble Gift their bountiful Creator hath given them, and is a right down Contradiction to the afore|&s;aid Attributes of God, and con&s;equently an Anti-Chri&s;tian Practice And &s;o, tho&s;e that op|po&s;e God and his Attributes, they may expect
<PB N="2" REF="001678_0009_0FB97FC10B222C88">
to incur his Di&s;plea&s;ure; So they may find a pregnant In&s;tance in <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his Egyptian Task-Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> This Practice contradicts Chri&s;ts com|mand, who commanded us, <HI>To do to all men as we would they &s;hould do to us,</HI> or as we would be done by. Now the buying and &s;elling of the <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Souls</HI> of Men, was and is the Merchandize of the Babyloni&s;h Merchants &s;poken of in the <HI>Revelations.</HI> Now the Tyranizing over and making Slaves of our Fellow Creatures, the Negroes, every one knows, or may know, this is not the way they would be done unto.</P>
<P>Now, I have &s;hown you, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> That this Practice oppo&s;es God and his Attributes, and 2<HI>dly,</HI> That it oppo&s;es Chri&s;t and his Command; And what is this in Effect but to bid Defyance, and to live in Oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t and his Go|&s;pel? and if &s;o, it is a high Degree of an An|tichri&s;tian Life and Practice.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>my beloved Friends,</HI> who are con|cerned in this Practice, as you love the Welfare of your immortal Souls, I intreat you (for it is for your &s;akes I labour) not lightly to look over the&s;e con&s;iderations, if ye think to receive a <HI>Reward for the Deeds done in the Body;</HI> For how will ye an&s;wer when ye are brought before <HI>Gods Tribunal,</HI> and there appear naked and bear before the Son of Man, if ye have lived and dyed in Oppo&s;ition to his everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, for the confirmation of which, for our Sakes, co&s;t him his precious Life, and now for a little worldly Intere&s;t, got in Oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Go&s;pel, by the Bondage and In&s;laving of Negroes; the very Reading of which is enough to make

all Hearts concerned to tremble. The very thoughts of this makes me declare, for all the Riches and Honours of this world, I would not be found in this Antichri&s;tian Life and Practice.</P>
<P>3<HI>ly,</HI> I have &s;hewed before, That GOD, who is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, hath given to all men a Freedom of their Wills, to pitch upon their own choice, for both Soul and Body, which are the only parts, next unto the Life, the free donation of our heavenly Father, in this ter|re&s;trial world; But it would &s;eem by the Negro-Ma&s;ters Practice and Arguments, that God did mi&s;s the matter, by his Wi&s;dom, when he gave the Negros (his Creatures) the Freedom of their Wills; but our Negro-Ma&s;ters have found out, by their Inginuity, how to mend this (&s;eeming) Defect, in two re&s;pects, to wit, that is to rob them of their Freedom, and make them bond-Slaves and their Po&s;terity forever. And in the next place, they can highly inrich them|&s;elves by the Bargain; by the unparallelled and never enough lamented Bondage and Slavery of tho&s;e poor Creatures and handy work of God, And can afford to keep them&s;elves with white hands, except at &s;ome Times they chance to be be &s;parkled with the Blood of tho&s;e poor Slaves, when they fall to beating them with their <HI>twi&s;ted Hides</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;e-whips,</HI> and other <HI>In|&s;truments of Cruelty,</HI> too barbarous here to relate, all done in the name of their de&s;ervings and correction. And furthermore, they can afford (by their beloved <HI>Diana,</HI> their Slaves) to go with <HI>fine powdered Perriwigs,</HI> and great <HI>bunched

<P>And when their Ma&s;ters &s;ee fit they will <HI>hang them up by their Thumbs,</HI> and then command another Negro to beat him &s;o long, as his Ma&s;ter &s;ees fit; this he mu&s;t not refu&s;e to do, if it were his <HI>own Father,</HI> nay, further, they will force them to be very <HI>Hang-men;</HI> And notwith&s;tanding of all this, &s;ome of them mu&s;t go with a <HI>hungry Belly,</HI> and that which they do get to eat (ye need not

<P>Now all that fear God cannot but know that tho&s;e men who u&s;e &s;uch Cruelty are not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> but are even de&s;titute of <HI>humane Civility,</HI> and <HI>Pity</HI> and <HI>Mercy;</HI> There|fore their Example can be no more a Rule for keeping Slaves than it is for u&s;ing &s;uch inhumane Cruelty, which all &s;ober Men abhor; For it cannot be expected that men of &s;uch Cruelty have much regard to the lawfulne&s;s of what they do, and it is great Pity that men who are na|turally more moderate and merciful &s;hould be led to the Practice of an unlawful thing by the Example of the <HI>vile&s;t of men.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Servants of &s;uch cruel Ma&s;ters; By this De&s;cription all may &s;ee, that they are put under an unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inning to maintain <HI>&s;elf-Pre&s;ervation,</HI> an In&s;tinct of Nature belonging to all the Creatures of God; So &s;elf-pre&s;ervation puts them to <HI>&s;teal, rob,</HI> and <HI>lye,</HI> and many other &s;infull Actions; nay, &s;ome of them when they &s;ee them&s;elves &s;urrounded and trappaned with all the Mi&s;cries afore&s;aid, and many more, then they go into Di&s;pair, and mi&s;erably <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them&s;elves,</HI> and &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their <HI>Ma&s;ters,</HI> to get rid of their Tortures and mi|&s;erable Slavi&s;h Life There was one of them (<HI>I</HI> think) within le&s;s then two years ago, &s;hot him&s;elf whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h a Gun, near his Ma&s;ters Hou&s;e, within a few miles off the place where I write this lamentable &s;tory.</P>

<P>And now, <HI>Reader,</HI> I have given thee a &s;mall View of the U&s;age and Treatment of the&s;e poor mi&s;erable Slaves; for if I would enlarge upon their U&s;age, I need write nothing el&s;e to &s;well up a Book to I know not what bigne&s;s; The <HI>parting of Man</HI> and <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> being &s;uch a heinous &s;in committed by the Negro-Ma&s;ters, I cannot pa&s;s by; The parting the Husband from the Wife, and the Wife from the Husband, and their Children from them both, to make up their Ma&s;ters Gains, they force them thus to break the &s;eventh Command, and commit Adultery with other &s;trangers, or other mens Wives or Husbands. The&s;e and the like U&s;ages, is enough to make them believe, there is no God at all, and harden them in Idolatrous Wor&s;hip, and make them bla&s;pheme again&s;t the holy God, that he takes not immediate Vengeance on &s;uch notorious Offenders. And here are the <HI>fir&s;t three</HI> Commands broken, occa&s;ioned by their Ma&s;ters. And the breaking the <HI>fourth</HI> is evident to all; for &s;ome, for want of Food and other nece&s;&s;a|ries, for all their hard weeks Labour to inrich their Ma&s;ter, for to maintain Self-pre&s;ervation, puts them to work on the Fir&s;t Day of the Week, to &s;upply their pure Nece&s;&s;ities, and &s;o break that which their Ma&s;ters call the Chri&s;tian

And their Children being &s;old from their Parents, they unavoidably cannot honour them; and here is the breach of the <HI>fifth.</HI> And to get rid of their mi&s;erable Tortures, many kill them&s;elves and others; and here is the breach of the <HI>Sixth.</HI> The parting of Man and Wife makes them commit <HI>Adultery</HI> with others; and here is the breach of the <HI>Seventh.</HI> To maintain Self-pre&s;ervation, they unavoidably mu&s;t <HI>&s;teal;</HI> and here is the breach of the <HI>Eight.</HI> Then they run away to avoid their Tortures, and when they are catcht their Ma&s;ter will ask them, <HI>Do you not de&s;erve to be hung up and Beat?</HI> and here they mu&s;t bear Fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t them&s;elves (which is wor&s;e than again&s;t their Neighbours) and &s;ay, <HI>yes, I do, we &s;erve to be hung up and Beat;</HI> and here is the breach of the <HI>ninth.</HI> And when they are in great nece&s;&s;ity of Food and Rayment, and have it not of their own, they unavoidably mu&s;t covet it of their Neigh|bours, and here is the breach of the <HI>Tenth.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Reader,</HI> here are all the Ten Commands of God (occa&s;ioned by their Ma&s;ters) broken by them. This is &s;uch a Charge, that I doubt it will be too hot or too heavy for the Negro-Ma&s;ters to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>And now that tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who in their <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> did engage to keep <HI>all gods holy commands,</HI> &s;hould not keep them, but break them them|&s;elves and for their own Gains, do lay all man|ner of unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ities upon their Slavs

<P>Now, it is not unpo&s;&s;ible but that an <HI>American Negro Ma&s;ter</HI> and a <HI>Turk</HI> &s;hould meet and di&s;|cour&s;e this Point betwixt them, And the <HI>Turk</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, <Q>I am well plea&s;ed, Brother that you and we agree &s;o well in this Point, <HI>viz.</HI> in ma|king Slaves of them we can have the Ma&s;tery over; And I doubt not but many of us have been at a &s;tand whether it may not be a &s;in to u&s;e our fellow Creatures &s;o cruelly: but now I think it is Time to give over &s;uch <HI>D</HI>oubts, when we &s;ee it &s;o mightily practi&s;ed by the <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> I mean the <HI>American Chri&s;tians;</HI> I make this Di&s;tinction, becau&s;e it is not practi&s;ed in <HI>Europe.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>And now, Brother, I would argue a little plainer with you, How comes it to pa&s;s, that you find Fault with us for making Slaves of Men, when you your &s;elves do the &s;ame? How can that be an evil and a &s;in in us, which is a Chri&s;tian Practice among your &s;elves? And I hear, that when any of your Slaves turns Chri&s;tian, and is baptized and receives the Chri&s;tian Faith, you keep them in perpetual Slavery for all, and &s;o they have no encourag|ment to turn Chri&s;tian upon that &s;core, which &s;hews to me, that you have but a &s;mall E&s;teem for your Religion, or at lea&s;t are very lukewarm for <HI>Pro&s;elytes.</HI></P>

<P>And how comes it that you differ among your &s;elves in this Practice? for there are &s;ome zealous men among you, that both di&s;pute and write again&s;t you, and they declare it to be an Antichri&s;tian Practice; And the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Europe</HI> do not practice it.

<P><HI>Negro Ma&s;ter.</HI> It is true, we have as good Grounds for the one as for the other, and I will freely acknowledge that if the many Wives and Concubines would bring in &s;uch Advantage to us as our Negro-Slaves do, I doubt not but we &s;hould plead as &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fly for the <HI>one</HI> as for the <HI>other;</HI> But the many Wives and Concubines not being ad|vantagous, we in Di&s;cretion drop that part of our Argument, and keep clo&s;e to that which brings us Gains? So I need not enlarge to trouble my &s;elf to cite every chapter and Ver&s;e, for I take it for a Maxim, That all the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> where it treats upon that &s;ubject, is upon our &s;ide; and I have heard &s;ome of us alledge out of the New Te&s;tament, that <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> was a Slave, but &s;ince <HI>I</HI> have read <HI>Pools Annotations</HI> on the Place, I will not be &s;o unmanly as to a&s;&s;ert it as a Proof; I think I have Proof enough, that have the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> although I meddle not with the <HI>New.</HI></P>
<P>And now I think I have proved by Scripture, that keeping of Slaves was practi&s;ed of Old; And now I intend to &s;hew that it is according to the <HI>Chri&s;tianity of our Times, Fir&s;t</HI> by the con|&s;ent

and agrement of all the &s;everal Sects of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I begin then with the famous <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of <HI>Eng|land</HI> (who are not ignorant of our Negro-<HI>P</HI>ractice) who by their Chri&s;tian care do &s;end their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> hither to <HI>America,</HI> to teach the Inhabitants here the Principles and Practices of Chri&s;tianity; And it is evident tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;io|naries do make their Gains by Negro Slaves, and have their Hou&s;es crawling <HI>black</HI> with them, by which they &s;et an Example to others to follow their &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eps; And not a word of Sin in all this.

<P>And <HI>Secondly,</HI> I can &s;hew by that famous and zealous Sect of <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> who have been di|ligent followers of the Principles and Practices of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> witne&s;s the Rejecting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Ma&s;s-Book, and many other Roman Super&s;titions, &s;o kind kindly entertai|ned (as they think) by &s;ome of their Prote|&s;tant Brethren; and a People very zealous in their Lives and Church Di&s;cipline; and yet both Preachers and People do joyntly agree with the Church in making Slaves of Negroes.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I can &s;hew by that pious Sect of <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> Witne&s;s &s;ome of them their Mo|de&s;ty in Apparel, and their Dexterity in the Point of Water-Bapti&s;m, in telling the re&s;t of Chri&s;tians in Print, that they do cheat the World in the Point of Infant Bapti&s;m; but they very
<PB N="13" REF="001678_0020_0FB97FD81F9DD770">
Lovingly embrace this Practice in making Slaves of Negroes.</P>
<P>Now if the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> did but agree &s;o lovingly in other Points as they do in making Slaves of Negroes, I think they might be &s;tiled <HI>One Community.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if tho&s;e &s;everal Sects of Chri&s;tians and their unanimous Agreement in this Practice of making <HI>Slaves of Negroes,</HI> as I have already &s;hewed, does not amount to a Proof, I know not what will,</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;tians An&s;wer,</HI> I do confe&s;s this is a Proof, that &s;ome of all tho&s;e &s;everal Sects do Practi&s;e this Point of Impiety, which I would readily have confe&s;&s;ed without a word of Proof, except what mine Eyes have &s;een; For all the&s;e Sects of People both by Principle and Practice do <HI>Fight,</HI> and <HI>Kill,</HI> and take away the Lives of many Thou&s;ands in Battles, for their inriching of them&s;elves, and for their own Advantages, and therefore it is no Wonder that all tho&s;e Sects agree &s;o well in making Slaves of Negros, or others whom they can get the Ma&s;tery over (for their own Advantage.)</P>
<P>But as this is very forreign from <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and out of the Peaceable Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah (for <HI>worrying, Tearing</HI> and <HI>Killing</HI> are the marks of <HI>Dogs, Wolves</HI> and <HI>Bears,</HI> which is the Practice of tho&s;e afore&s;aid Sects of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as they call them&s;elves: but the Innocence of Lambs and Doves was and is the Characteri&s;tick of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) &s;o I think this is &s;ufficient to over|&s;et what was alledged for a Proof by the Pra|ctice

of all tho&s;e &s;everol Sects of Chri&s;tians for en&s;laving of their fellow Creatures the Negros For I thought the Go&s;pel had not been <HI>Cruelty</HI> but had been <HI>Innocence, Love, Meekne&s;s, Patience, Long-Suffering,</HI> and plenteous in <HI>Forgivene&s;s,</HI> and other <HI>Emblems</HI> of the Attributes of God, and that Chri&s;tians were to <HI>give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Backs to the Smiter</HI> and <HI>their C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ecks to them that pluck off the Hair.</HI></P>
<P>But I have a further An&s;wer for you, and that is, I utterly deny that either <HI>Church-men</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;|byterians</HI> have generally agreed in making Slaves of Negros; For &s;ome of both have preached and &s;ome have printed again&s;t it here in <HI>North America;</HI> And &s;ome that have had Negroes their Con&s;cience would not allow them to keep them for Slaves, but after &s;ome Time of Service they &s;et them free.</P>
<P>Hence I infer, That making Slaves of men is an evil &s;o abominable in the nature of it that men who&s;e Principles are &s;o large as to allow of <HI>Killing men,</HI> cannot allow of making Men <HI>Slaves,</HI> accounting it wor&s;e to <HI>Rob</HI> men o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Labour,</HI> who have done them no harm, then it is to kill them that ri&s;e up again&s;t them.</P>
<P>And hence I infer, that none would believe it lawfull, if they were not either blinded with the love of Gain, or with the plau&s;ible Pretences o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch as are.</P>
<P><HI>Negro Ma&s;ter.</HI> Hold! I think I have another Proof, which, according to your own Argu|ment I think will bind you. There is another numerous and famous &s;ect of Chri&s;tians, called

<P>And yet I cannot &s;ee how they can be a Proof in this, above all other Chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially when it is thought by &s;ome of the <HI>hone&s;t hearted</HI> among them, that about the <HI>eleventh</HI> Year of the eighteenth Century the mo&s;t of them Sa|crificed their primitive <HI>I</HI>nnocence, when they &s;o lovingly agreed and joyned with the other Sects to pay the Souldiers their proportion of Wages to go in the Expedition again&s;t their Neighbours of <HI>Canada;</HI> And when they loo&s;e their <HI>lnnocence,</HI> I know not what they keep that is <HI>lovely</HI> among them.</P>

here among the <HI>Quakers?</HI> and yet they are both Merchants and Ma&s;ters of Negroes.

All the Time preceeding that fore-mention|ed Year, particularly <HI>One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred nine|ty two,</HI> when <HI>Andrew Hamilton</HI> was Governour of the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> Did not all the <HI>Quakers</HI> refu&s;e to pay the Souldiers to fight again&s;t the French at <HI>Albany?</HI> for the which Refual, great Havock was made of their Goods by Con&s;tables.

far in <HI>Argument?</HI> and if it do, <HI>I</HI> have the le&s;s to do but make a &s;hort Review how <HI>I</HI> have Prove by the Practice and Example of all that diver|&s;ity of Sects of our <HI>American Chri&s;tians,</HI> and la&s;tly and mainly by our <HI>American Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if what I have &s;aid do not amount to perfect Proof that we may make Slaves of Ne|gros, or any other that we can get the Ma&s;tery over, <HI>I</HI> think the <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> forever may be &s;ilent to bring in the Example and Agree|ment of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Orthodox, to be a Proof in that Point of the <HI>Real Pre&s;ence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;tians An&s;wer.</HI> There is a good Body o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> People without the Bounds of your In&s;tance and that is the <HI>German-Quakers,</HI> who live in <HI>Ger|man-Town</HI> near <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> Who to their re|nowned Prai&s;e be it &s;poken) have above all other Sects in <HI>America,</HI> kept their Hands clean from that <HI>vile Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>inriching Sin</HI> of making Slaves of their fellow Creatures, the Negros, as I was credibly informed by one of them&s;elves, and &s;o have particular Men of all Sects kept them&s;elves free from this inriching &s;in.</P>
<P>But now I come to your In&s;tance of <HI>Ninety Two,</HI> that the <HI>Quakers</HI> were all <HI>I</HI>nnocent then, excepting one Man. This amounts to no more then this, that they were an excellent People in that day, far exceeding other Sects of <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> and yet were mo&s;t &s;hamefully overtaken with this inriching Sin, in breaking Chri&s;ts Command in making Slaves of Negros, which they would be loath to be done by.

Head (which I think will utterly overturn all that you have &s;aid upon it) The <HI>Quakers</HI> had before that Time, embraced <HI>Magi&s;tracy,</HI> which cannot be upheld without the <HI>Carnal Sword,</HI> whereby they being apo&s;tatized from their primitive Innocency and Purity, and become, in that like the re&s;t of the World, it is no Won|der to &s;ee them in a Practice &s;o ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eable to it, in making Slaves of their fellow Creatures for their Gain and Advantage.</P>
<P>For it was the making Slaves of Negroes, to inrich them&s;elves, and the embracing of Magi|&s;tracy, <HI>which could not be excecuted without the car|nal Sword,</HI> which were the two pincipla Baits that Catched many of that once mo&s;t Worthy People.</P>
<P>Thus far the <HI>Negro-Ma&s;ter</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian in in after Ages.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Chri&s;t an Reader,</HI> If thou ha&s;t any tender Love to that harmle&s;s Lamb, the inno|cent Me&s;&s;iah, and his harmle&s;s and innocent Go&s;pel, thou can&s;t not but &s;ee that the ma|king Slaves of Negros is an abominable Anti-Chri&s;tian Practice.

<P>There is one thing more, and then I think to take my leave at pre&s;ent, of our Negro-Ma&s;ters, and that is, I earne&s;tly invite them to
<PB N="20" REF="001678_0027_0FB97FE4E2CF1A30">
<HI>Repentance;</HI> But how to attain to their Repen|tance, is the Que&s;tion, for &s;uch a heinous &s;in; for they will find it to be a &s;in of the <HI>Second Table,</HI> that is, in plainer words a &s;in <HI>again&s;t God</HI> and <HI>Man both;</HI> And <HI>I</HI> am of Opinion, that &s;uch Sins cannot be repented of without <HI>Re&s;titution</HI> made to them that they have wronged; for until the <HI>Cau&s;e he removed,</HI> I know not how the <HI>Effect &s;hould</HI> cea&s;e.

But if it &s;hould happen that a Reader &s;hould con&s;true, that if the Negro-Ma&s;ters do not make Re&s;titution to the Negroes for the wrong that they have done them, the Forgivene&s;s of God cannot well be obtained, and then leave it to the Negro-Ma&s;ters to judge of the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The next thing that comes into Con&s;idera|tion, What and if our Negro-Ma&s;ters &s;hould live and dye without making any Re&s;titution at all, to their mi&s;erable Slaves whom they have &s;o unju&s;tly wronged?

<P>But for the further under&s;tanding of this An&s;wer, I &s;uppo&s;e then that God hath allotted unto all Mankind an <HI>I</HI>nheritance of Eternal Life, and has written their Names in the Book of Life, and this appears by the frequent men|tioning
<PB N="21" REF="001678_0028_0FB97FE6513355E8">
of it in Scripture, of the blotting their Names out of the Book of Life, which could not be, except their Names were fir&s;t written therein; and &s;o all Men may expect to enjoy their Fathers Gift, the Inheritance of Eternal Life, except they forfeit the &s;ame in &s;inning again&s;t God, or &s;inning again&s;t God and Man, and then their Names are blotted out, as God &s;aid unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Him that &s;inneth again&s;t me, him will I blot out.</P>
<P>And now I come to the Re&s;titution again, and &s;ay, It cannot &s;tand with the Ju&s;tice of God that the Negroes or the wronged &s;hall have no Re&s;titution at all; and &s;eeing then that they mu&s;t be re&s;tored of the Wrongs that they have &s;uffered, it mu&s;t be re&s;tored out of the Property of him that hath wronged them; and this Pro|perty is his <HI>I</HI>ntere&s;t of Eternal Life; and &s;uch a proportion of this as will be equivolent to the Wrongs done unto the Negroes or any others, mu&s;t go to make up this Re&s;titution; for they will have it.</P>
<P>For they will have it made up out of your <HI>Portion in Glory,</HI> if you have any left for your &s;elves; and if you have not, you may expect &s;o much the more <HI>Torment;</HI> and if the Negros or Wronged have no Portion left in Glory to be <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> by it, they may expect to have &s;o much the <HI>le&s;s</HI> Torment;</P>

<P>TO &s;ay that Chri&s;t dyed for none but the Elect only, and that his Death was Effectual for none but only the Elect, is a vain and ridiculous &s;tory, &s;o long as you affirm, That from all Eternity they were elected and decreed to Salvation; &s;uch then as were made &s;o &s;ure of their Salvation, &s;tood in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> need of a Saviour to die for them, as I hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall make appear.

elect, for the&s;e who were Decreed to Salvation could never be lo&s;t, as I have already &s;aid. So then the true con&s;equence of your doctrine of Prede&s;tination, is, that Chri&s;t dyed in vain, yea that he dyed not at, all for the elect; for the elect were &s;ecure enough without his dying for them; for &s;o long as God is God, the De|cree is &s;ure and their &s;alvation certain without the death of Chri&s;t. So then if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> made &s;uch a Decree as you &s;ay he did, in vain was the Law and the Prophets, in vain was all that Chri&s;t did, and all the labours of his Apo&s;tles and all good men were to no purpo&s;e.

Now then, accor|ding to your doctrine of Prede&s;tination the ca&s;e &s;tands thus with every individual man and Woman, If one be decreed for perdition, let him live Never &s;o holy and righteous a life hell and damnation is their portion, for the Decree cannot be broken.</P>
<P>Again, if one prede&s;tinate to life, &s;hould live, Never &s;o wickedly, heaven and happine&s;s is their portion, for the Decree cannot be altered. Is not this ric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y to reward the door of evil with good, and the doer of good with an evil re|ward. Is not this to call light darkne&s;s, and darkne&s;s light, which is ridiculous. All which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;es naturally from your doctrine of prede&s;ti|nation, as you hold it.</P>

and their incon&s;i&s;tence with God &s;cripture and rea&s;on are not &s;een into and redre&s;&s;ed. Again is it not a great di&s;honour to God to have the &s;tability of his decrees que&s;tioned, as though he could not decree the elects &s;alvation without the death of his Son? Is not this to que&s;tion his omnipotency, and run him to that pinch, either to break his Decree, or then to deliver up his well beloved Son to &s;uch an ignonunious death as he under-went.</P>
<P>What! my <HI>dear Friends,</HI> mu&s;t God &s;end forth his only Son, in whom he is well plea&s;ed, to ran&s;om from Hell, Death and De&s;truction, tho&s;e whom he had elected from all Eternity, for that &s;ingle Slip in <HI>Adam,</HI> which they knew no|thing of? otherwi&s;e his decrees were vain, falli|ble and in&s;ignificant, notwith&s;tanding they were made by an Omnipotent Power from all eter|nity. Oh! is it not a wonder that men are not a&s;hamed of &s;uch ab&s;urd Doctrine.</P>
<P>Again, is it not a great di&s;honour done to JESUS Chri&s;t to &s;ay, that be died for&punc; tho&s;e that &s;tood in no need of him to die for them, who were &s;o &s;ure of Salvation as the Prede&s;ti|nation, Election and Decree of an omnipotent Power could make them, &s;uch wanted no Saviour to die for them, for &s;uch never were, are, nor can be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>my Friends,</HI> if you think that you are that elect, or a part of that elect, it is by what is here made mo&s;t plain and &s;ufficiently evident, that you can lay no claim to Chri&s;t, nor reap any benefit by his meritorious Death

and Sufferings, nor expect Salvation from him; for you are &s;ure enough without him; for as &s;ure as there is a God in Heaven, as &s;ure are they of Salvation whom he elects and decrees to Life from all Eternity, without the death of his Son. And therefore it is in vain for you to expect Salvation from Chri&s;t, in &s;o doing you do but deceive your &s;elves. You may look after God and his eternal Decree for that, and not from Chri&s;t; for if it be true, that you are in the number of that early Elect, you are &s;ufficiently &s;ecure, blow the Storm which way it will; you need not be beholden to Chri&s;t, you do but thereby provoke God to &s;ay to you, as Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>O ye of little faith, why do ye doubt?</HI> And therefore you may make up your account with your early Decrees, and not with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>For Chri&s;t was not concerned with you, for ye were never Lo&s;t. For the Work that Chri&s;t had to do, was to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t, and not that which was not, nor could not be lo&s;t.

<P>We &s;ee here that a part of Chri&s;ts Work was to preach the acceptable Year of the Lord; and to whom he was to preach it, his own Words are very plain; and by the acceptable Year I under&s;tand, that God without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons was willing to receive into his love and favour every one that was willing to cea&s;e to do evil, and learn to do well, and believe in Chri&s;t the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;iah and Saviour of the World, who came to &s;eek and &s;ave &s;uch as were gone a&s;tray and play'd the prodigal, with all &s;uch as he mentions. So that you &s;ee that it was none of tho&s;e that were elected from all eternity; for they were &s;afe in all weathers. But you have neither Day, Month nor Year that is ac|ceptable to preach to any but your &s;elves, it may be that you may under&s;tand a few more then your&s;elves to make up the elect, but that you know be&s;t. But this I know, that you have damned, reprobated, and made Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath of all mankind, if your <HI>&s;ay &s;o,</HI> could do it, except as I have ju&s;t now excepted.</P>
<P>Endle&s;s are the Ab&s;urdities that may be rai&s;|ed from your Principles and Doctrine. You &s;ay, the Scripture is your Rule, and the only Rule, but in effect you Rule the Scriptures, and not the &s;criptures you; for your Doctrine and Principles are quite another thing from the Scripture. But more e&s;pecially in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> Principle and Doctrine of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> as is
<PB N="51" REF="001678_0060_0FB9802BEE57D0B8">
&s;ufficiently evident from the&s;e few Words in an&s;wer to this one particular, <HI>viz. That Chri&s;t died for none but whom you call the Elect, and that none were nor are redeemed by him but only them.</HI> Oh! here is but little Love and Charity either to God or Man.</P>
<P>Furthermore, for you to think or &s;ay, That Chri&s;t died for tho&s;e elect of whom you &s;peak, is a grand errour, and a great mi&s;take in you; I doubt ye have only dreamed &s;o, and are not yet wakened out of &s;leep. The &s;ign or &s;ignal is given, you may take the Alarum as you &s;ee cau&s;e, but if you be in the number of that early Elect, of which you talk, then are you &s;ufficiently &s;afe and &s;ecure, nothing can alarm you; but if you are not, then are you warned, &s;o that God is clear of your blood, and &s;o am I, as will yet further appear from what follows.</P>
<P>Neither have you any real foundation for this your a&s;&s;ertion in holy Scripture, and I do not believe that you &s;hall find &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion from the beginning of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the end of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> as that, to wit, <HI>That Chri&s;t died for none but the Elect.</HI> It may be you may per|haps find it in &s;ome old corrupt Catechi&s;m or Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, but not in the Bible, for the whole currant of Scripture is again&s;t you therein.</P>
<P>For any that God did from Eternity elect to Life, wanted not Chri&s;t to die for them, they were &s;uch as could never wander nor go a&s;tray, being the fir&s;t born of Eternity, that never

play'd the prodigal, nor could they &s;tray, being &s;o well fenced in with a triple Wall, <HI>viz.</HI> as <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> The Wall of Prede&s;tination, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> The Wall of Election, and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> The unpa&s;&s;able Wall of a Decree, made by an Omnipotent Power. So that neither your Elect nor you, (if you reckon your &s;elves of that number) could never wan|der nor go a&s;tray, &s;o long as God is GOD, as I have already &s;ufficiently proved. And &s;o, for &s;hame, never more hereafter doubt nor que&s;tion God or his Decrees, left ye be turned one among&s;t the Unbelievers to &s;eek &s;anctuary el&s;e-where, for your ingratitude and Mis-belief.</P>
<P>So that ye may plainly &s;ee and under&s;tand, that it was another Elect then you, one of a lat|ter date then from all Eternity, That Chri&s;t was concerned with, to &s;eek and to &s;ave, to gather, build and in&s;truct in all things nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation in order to eternal Life.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>my Freinds,</HI> how do yow Reli&s;h this di&s;cour&s;e? do you not think it &s;trange to &s;ee your &s;elves at once turned away from both Chri&s;t and Chri&s;tianity, to &s;eek Salvation and Religion &s;uitable to your nece&s;&s;ity; for in Chri&s;t and Chri&s;tianity you can expect neither, &s;o long as you are in that belief, <HI>viz.</HI> That God did chu&s;e a certain Number of Mankind to Salva|tion, and all the re&s;t he Reprobated and Dam|ned, making them Ve&s;&s;els of Di&s;honour, and objects of his Wrath forever, they having do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> neither good nor evil, and that this was do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> before they were in being, how long a time it was before, no Angel nor Man can tell.

all your other Ab&s;urdities which ye hold, too tedious here to mention.</P>
<P>Again, they &s;ay, <HI>As God appointed the Elect to glory, &s;o hath he fore ordained all the means thereunto,</HI> that is to &s;ay, he fore-ordained a Cup of Life and Salvation for the Elect, but a Cup of Death and wrath for all the re&s;t of mankind. O Un|charitable and Wicked A&s;&s;ertion! mo&s;t di&s;ho|nourable to God, and mo&s;t pernicious to Man|kind; I deny it, as mo&s;t ab&s;urd, and &s;o will God and all good Men.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that God fore-ordained any other means for the Salvation of the Elect, then what he fore-ordained for all Mankind in general, I al&s;o deny it, as a fal&s;e and vain &s;tory; for God hath freely given and granted to all Mankind (none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cepted) the benefit of Chri&s;t, who ta&s;ted Death for every man, and he is the common &s;alvation or Propitiation.

Where then is the Reprobation of all mankind, except that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that you call the Elect? Here is a very great pinch for you.</P>
<P>If God be &s;incere in his words, then is your &s;tory of Reprobation fal&s;e, and you are found to be fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es again&s;t God; but God mu&s;t be true in his words, and all that &s;ay other-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ays are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">yars; for who will not rather be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ve Gods general Declaration, then your private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ertion? but this is a little degre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>And Chri&s;t him&s;elf hath promi&s;ed, That who&s;o|ever comes to him, he will in no wayes ca&s;t out and his call by his &s;pirit is univer&s;al; deny it if you dare.</P>
<P>Neither is it &s;aid in holy &s;cripture, That God &s;o loved the Elect, but it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>God &s;o love the World</HI> &amp;c. That is, all the People in the World, without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, for with God there is no re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Again, for you to &s;ay, that the&s;e whom God did from all eternity (very early indeed) pre|de&s;tinate, elect, and Decree to Life and Salva|tion, that they &s;tood in need of any means to Salvation, is a &s;tory as vain and ridiculous, as that other a&s;&s;ertion (where you affirm, <HI>that Chri&s;t died for none, nor none are redeemed by him, but to Elect, only!</HI> Is not this to que&s;tion Gods Varacity and Decrees? Tho&s;e Elect wanted no Means no more then they wanted a Saviour to die for them, as I have made appear.</P>
<P>But what Means mu&s;t you have? The death of his well beloved Son? for &s;hame, is that the Means you want, be&s;ide that what you already have? If that be it, you are not like to have it although that be your Chiefe&s;t Means; for I tell you again, that I have already &s;ub&s;tantially

<HEAD>Salvation without Outward Bap|ti&s;m, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN the holy Scriptures, the Doctrine of the Prophets, Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, there is many promi&s;es of Salvation without the lea&s;t mentioning of one word of water Bapti&s;m, as <HI>Deut.</HI> 28 to v. 16. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. and 33. not one word of Water-Bapti&s;m. <HI>I&s;a</HI> 55. 7. <HI>Mich.</HI> 6. 8. compared with <HI>Deut.</HI> 10 12. with hundreds of places to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the Old Te&s;tament. Neither are &s;uch promi&s;es wanting in the New-Te&s;tament, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11. 28, 29, 30. compared with <HI>chap.</HI> 5. v 3. to 12. and chap. 10 v. 37, 38, 39. <HI>Mark</HI> 8. 34. <HI>Luke</HI> 9 23, 24. in all the&s;e not &s;o much as one word of Water Bap|ti&s;m; whereby we may plainly &s;ee that it is not the many and divers Wa&s;hings or Bapti&s;ms that will do our bu&s;ine&s;s, in order to attain eternal Sal|vation We mu&s;t deny our &s;elves and put on Chri&s;ts Yoke, and follow him in the Regeneration, to which is annexed the Promi&s;e of Life and Sal|vation, without one word of Water Bapti&s;m; that is, we mu&s;t deny Pride, and all the Super|fluities and vain Cu&s;toms of this world, and enter the Regeneration, bearing our daily Cro&s;s, and they that are faithful until death &s;hall then receive a Crown of Life, though they have never been baptized with Water.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 4. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In all this Con|ference there is not one word of Water-Bapti&s;m,

and yet he directs the Woman how &s;he might attain Salvation; he neither bids her go to the Prie&s;ts, nor yet to his Di&s;ciples, nor yet to <HI>John</HI> to be baptized with water, but in plain words tells her how &s;he may be &s;aved. The Woman taken in Adultery, whom Chri&s;t did ab&s;olve, he gave her no command to be baptized with Water, but like a harmle&s;s Lamb, in a few words, &s;hows her the only true way to Salvation, <HI>Go and &s;in no more.</HI> And it is very ob&s;ervable, that of the Mul|titude whom he cured, he never directed one of them to be baptized with Water, as well knowing how in&s;ignificant that &s;ign or ceremony was to Sal|vation, and therefore him&s;elf baptized none with water, nor yet &s;o much as once makes mention of it in all his long and unwearied Preachings. Again, the man that was blind from his Birth, <HI>John</HI> 9. whom Chri&s;t cured, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e neither commanded, coun|&s;elled nor advi&s;ed him to water-bapti&s;m, who for his noble and valiant te&s;timony to Chri&s;t was by the proud Prie&s;ts and learned Rabbies of the <HI>Jews</HI> ca&s;t out of their Society. In this di&s;tre&s;s Chri&s;t finds him out, and takes him into his, upon his acknowledgment of his Belief, <HI>vers</HI> 38. By which it plainly appears, that Salvation is annexed to be|lieving, to all that are under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen|&s;ation. And it will be yet more clear and plain if the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture be duly con&s;idered, <HI>Mark</HI> 1. 15. The fir&s;t thing that Chri&s;t preached was, <HI>Repent and believe the Go&s;pel.</HI> And <HI>John</HI> 5. 24. and 6 29. <HI>This is the work of God, that ye do believe.</HI> Mark 9. 23. <HI>All things are po&s;&s;ible to him that believes.</HI> Then is Salvation po&s;&s;ible without outward Bap|ti&s;m. And <HI>John</HI> 16. 16. <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be

<P>Now, every one of the&s;e Citations (with many more be&s;ides) have a faithful Promi&s;e of Salvation annexed to every one of them, by him that could not lye, without the lea&s;t regard had to Water-Bapti&s;m; nor have they relation to Water-Bap|ti&s;m, neither have the&s;e Promi&s;es any dependance upon it; which evidently appears from <HI>Peter'</HI>s own confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>Acts</HI> 10. 34,44. The&s;e having re|ceived the true Bapti&s;m, there was no more need of any &s;ign or ceremony of Water, &s;ince they had received the &s;ub&s;tance; for as the Day breaks the Shadows fly away; neither had <HI>Peter</HI> any command in all his Commi&s;&s;ion &s;o to do, nor to u&s;e any <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rites or Ceremonies among the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> the truth of this will yet further appear from the In&s;tructi|ons of the whole Church of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> who was the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>gentiles,</HI> declares in plain words, That he had no Commi&s;|&s;ion to baptize with Water.</P>
<P>But now look back to <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. and <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. from whence, they &s;ay, they have their Commi&s;&s;ion for Water-Bapti&s;m; but I deny there is any Command in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. for water Bapti&s;m, nor yet in <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. nor any men|tion made there of Water-Bapti&s;m; for their Salvation and Damnation is annexed to Believing or Dis-believing the Go&s;pel, without any depen|dance on Bapti&s;m, unle&s;s it be the true one that purges away all &s;in, but Water-Bapti&s;m cannot purge away one &s;in, &s;o in&s;ignificant is it to Salva|tion; and therefore down falls to nothing that new

A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz. No promi&s;e of Salvation without Wa|ter-Bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19 16. there came one to Chri&s;t, and &s;aid, <HI>Good Ma&s;ter, what good thing &s;hall I do, that I may have eternal Life?</HI> Chri&s;t &s;aid unto him, <HI>If thou would&s;t enter into Life, keep the Commands, and &s;ell that thou ha&s;t, and give to the Poor, and thou &s;halt have Trea&s;ure in heaven, and come and follow Me.</HI> Here is a mo&s;t &s;ure and certain Promi&s;e of Salvation without Water-Bapti&s;m, back't with two Wit|ne&s;&s;es more, to wit, both <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>Luke, Mark</HI> 10. 21. be&s;ides his former In&s;tructions, Chri&s;t bids him take up his Cro&s;s and follow him. The &s;ame In&s;tructions are recorded in <HI>Luke</HI> 18. 18. And this three-fold Cord is not ea&s;ily broke, and a four-fold Cord is yet more &s;tronger; for there is both Chri&s;t and the three Evangeli&s;ts that are one entire Te|&s;timony, That by keeping Gods Commands, by di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our hearts and affections of the world by true belief, and taking up the Cro&s;s (for No Cro&s;s, No Crown) and following the Example of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, to all which is annexed mo&s;t &s;ure and certain Promi&s;es of Salvation, without Water-Bapti&s;m; for if it had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o needful to Salvation as this new coyned Argument would have us to under&s;tand, Chri&s;t would never have omitted the propagation of it, all the while he taught on earth. I &s;ay, this new coyned Argument or A&s;&s;ertion (or rather a dream of &s;ome dark Imagination to maintain &s;elf-Intere&s;t) is &s;o &s;mooth and cunningly devi&s;ed, that in the ears of ignorant People it pa&s;&s;es for good Coyn unque&s;tioned, and makes the &s;imple believe they
<PB N="81" REF="001678_0089_0FB98062CAA6B710">
have gotten that which indeed they have not got, which is very detrimental to the advancement of Chri&s;ts Kingdom here upon earth.</P>
<P>And therefore <HI>my dear Friends and Brethren,</HI> If intere&s;t were &s;et a&s;ide, and the true Bapti&s;m preached and propagated through the world, I mean the bapti&s;m of the holy Gho&s;t, that puri|fies and cleanes the heart, and burns all &s;in, and makes the old Fabrick a new Creation, a fit Temple for God to dwell in, this is the Sub&s;tan|tial Bapti&s;m, which hath the certain Promi&s;e of Salvation to all that receive it, and abides in the operation of it, without the Sign or Cere|mony of Water Bapti&s;m. And how beneficial would this be to both the learned and unlearned. O! how it would advance the Intere&s;t and king|dom of Chri&s;t upon earth. And &s;o all the Lovers of God and &s;eekers of his Glory, the good of their Neighbour, and the eternal well-being of their Immortal Souls, would become Preachers of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, either in words or actions, and &s;ome in both, till the earth were full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Seas, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 11. 9. The Air would become temperate, the blu&s;tering Winds moderate, the mighty Raging and Roar|ing of the Seas calmed, and the extreams of Heat and Cold abated, and the Earth be like Pa|radi&s;e, and all Creatures would rejoyce in the goodne&s;s of the Lord; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55. and chap, 65. 16. to the end; and &s;o no more great Sums of Money paid for preaching, for all would be taught of God. And great will be the Peace of that day.
<PB N="82" REF="001678_0090_0FB980650F1FBFF8">
To further on this ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate is to help the Lord again&s;t the mighty, not with carnal but &s;piritual weapons, for the wrath of man works not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God. But to turn to a conclu&s;ion from this digre&s;&s;ion, I &s;ay, to conclude this Brief con&s;ideration, I think, I may &s;afely &s;ay of Water bapti&s;m, as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid of cir|cumci&s;ion, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 19. &s;aith he, neither circum|ci&s;ion nor uncircumci&s;ion avails any thing, but keeping Gods commands; &s;o it is neither the ha|ving, nor the wanting of Water bapti&s;m that makes a true Chri&s;tian, but a new creature, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 19. compare with <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 7. and 5. 6. for without the regeneration of all that is degene|rate, there is no Salvation, nor entrance into Gods Kingdom.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;ince Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were the true Pre&s;idents and Patterns of Chri&s;tianity, it mu&s;t Inevitably follow from thence&punc; that all the Articles of the Chri&s;tian faith were comman|ded and practi&s;ed by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles: But bapti&s;m with water, in the Name of the Father, Son and holy Gho&s;t, was neither comman|ded nor practi&s;ed by Chri&s;t nor his Apo&s;tles, and therefore is no article of the Chri&s;tian faith among us Gentiles And as tho&s;e other Arguments from Scripture, &s;o this la&s;t from Rea&s;on, is mo&s;t infallibly true and certain.</P>

Tho&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> which crucified Chri&s;t, was it not in their power to know that they did evil in &s;o doing? or was it in their power to know? If the fir&s;t, how could they be condemned for their utter inability? If the la&s;t, how comes it to pa&s;s that Chri&s;t prayed for Pardon of tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ins which the&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> either knew, or might have known them to be &s;in?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It cannot be the &s;ins of Knowledge that Chri&s;t prayed be to forgiven; &s;ee what is &s;aid again&s;t &s;uch Wickedne&s;s, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3. <HI>The &s;ins of the Hou&s;e of</HI> Eli <HI>&s;hall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e purged with Sacrifice, &amp;c.</HI> Neither could it be Willful &s;ins that Chri&s;t pray'd might be Remitted; For Willful &s;ins there re|mains no Sacrifice, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 26. Neither could it be Pre&s;umptuous &s;ins that Chri&s;t prayed might be Forgiven; for that &s;eems to be a greater &s;in than either of the two former, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 23 <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19. 13. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 10. Neither could it be the &s;in of that &s;ort of Ignorance which is not in the power of Man to help, which Chri&s;t prayed for the Re|mi&s;&s;ion of, for that could produce no &s;in, as I have already hinted; for our God is &s;o righteous, &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o merciful and loving a Father to all his Creatures, that he will not charge them with <HI>I</HI>m|po&s;&s;ibilities,
<PB N="86" REF="001678_0094_0FB98071E24CA7A8">
no more than he will o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> can cea&s;e to be God. Nor do <HI>I</HI> think that Chri&s;t levelled his Petition again&s;t any of the&s;e four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ins, but only again&s;t our carele&s;s, &s;loathful and negligent im|provement of the&s;e divine Gifts and Graces which we have received of God to work out our Salva|tion by.</P>
<P><LABEL>Que&s;t. 3.</LABEL>
But if Chri&s;t did him&s;elf remit, and al&s;o prayed to God that he al&s;o would remit tho&s;e Sns of Igno|rance, which the&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> did commit in cruci|fying of Chri&s;t; and if we are bound by the Ru|les of Chri&s;tianity to follow Chri&s;ts Example, will not this Doctrine open a door to a carele&s;s and ignorant way of living; and he that is mo&s;t Ignorant may Lay claim to the greate&s;t Privi|ledge in Remi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o plead Chri&s;ts Exam|ple therein? Here is a pinch indeed.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> What &s;ins we are to remit, and what &s;ins we are not to remit, I refer to the fore-part of the <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the fir&s;t Que&s;tion; as al&s;o, if all Offences and Injuries were to be remitted, both by God and Man, then would there not be lo&s;t one of all the Off-&s;pring of <HI>Adam;</HI> and con&s;e|quently, neither Hell nor Reprobation; This I al&s;o refer to the An&s;wer of the fir&s;t Query. And now, to &s;hut up clo&s;e that open door to a Libertine kind of life, let all People know (if there be any &s;uch as do not know) that God is a free Agent, and may, if he plea&s;e, remit all &s;ins and Offences what&s;oever done again&s;t him, but without true and unfeigned Repentance, and for&s;aking the evil, and cleaving to that which is
<PB N="87" REF="001678_0095_0FB98073807E6B48">
good, there is neither Precept, Pre&s;ident nor Example for any &s;uch thing in all the holy Scriptures, that I know of; but on the contrary it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>That GOD by no means will clear the guilty, but will render a Reward to every one according to their deeds,</HI> Exod. 23. 7. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 34. 7. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 8. 2. <HI>Cor..</HI> 5. 10.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Man,</HI> he being made in the likene&s;s of God, he al&s;o is a free Agent, and may, if he plea&s;e, remit all Offences and injuries done again&s;t him, but he is not bound to do &s;o, by any Law or Command, as I have already &s;aid. The&s;e two joyned together, do make &s;uch a &s;trong Bolt to bar that Door, that there can be no entrance there to any Libertine kind of life. Therefore let none pre&s;ume to offend or di&s;honour God, or di&s;gu&s;t and injure their Neighbour, and &s;o pre|tend their Ignorance was the cau&s;e; but let &s;uch remember, that it is &s;aid, there is no Dark|ne&s;s nor &s;hadow of Death where the workers of Iniquity can hide them&s;elves, <HI>Job.</HI> 34. 21, 22. <HI>Chap.</HI> 31. 4.

<P>'Tis true, there was a time of Ignorance, in which it is &s;aid <HI>God wincked at, but now he commands all to repent and turn to their Maker,</HI> he having given a more fuller and clearer di&s;pen&s;ation then what he had formerly done.</P>
<P>And therefore none need to pretend Ignorance, for every one hath Light and Grace &s;ufficient, it they will make u&s;e of it, to rule and regulate their Life and Conver&s;ation by.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="001678_0096_0FB98075A1658B98">
Now may it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e times of Ignorance at which God winked, (here &s;poken of by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 17. 30.) commenced from <HI>Adams</HI> Fall, to the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, or rather among the <HI>Gentiles</HI> from the begin|ning of Idolatry, till that time that <HI>Peter</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Cornelius</HI> the Centurion, who was a <HI>Gentile,</HI> and having received his Commi&s;&s;ion, after he had &s;een the vi&s;ion of the Sheet that was let down from Heaven by the four Corners thereof, which things done, <HI>Peter</HI> neither makes Objection nor Delay to proclaim and preach the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t to and among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> which was glad Tidings to all <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and put an end to tho&s;e times of Ignorance at which God wincked, <HI>Acts.</HI> 17. 30.</P>
<P>Now the Certainty and Circum&s;tances of this Commi&s;&s;ion makes that in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. the more doubtful; for if that be certain, as &s;ome &s;up|po&s;e, then what need was there either of <HI>Peters Vi&s;ion</HI> or Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Acts</HI> 10 11. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rs</HI> And thus the Partition Wall that was betwixt <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> is totally broken down, according to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e|ters</HI> own words, <HI>Act,</HI> 10. 34. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>So having &s;aid what I think needful, in an|&s;wer to that Que&s;tion, ea&s;ing of that Pinch, and barring of that pretended Door, I &s;hall &s;hut

<P>AS I would not be &s;ound in Flattery, &s;o I would not be Remi&s;s in my Duty in giving this Author his true value, who, when thou ha&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead his Treati&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee&s;t what a high e&s;teem and tender Regard he had of the glory of GOD, and the Everla&s;ting well|being of the Souls of all Men, thou can&s;t not but e&s;teem him to have been a worthy Author; for in the place where he was known, his pious innocent Life and Practice did be&s;peak his worth far above all the Commendations that a Po&s;t-&s;cript can give of him. But unto &s;trangers that knew him not, I hone&s;tly declare unto them, for harmle&s;sne&s;s and Innocency, within the bounds of my knowledge, I know not his fellow upon Earth, excepting one other Man; and he hath left this Mite of his as a Token of his Love he had to the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Adam,</HI> and for the benefit and well-being of their Immortal Souls. And he was a diligent Searcher into the innocent and harmle&s;s Prin|ciples of Chri&s;tianity, and al&s;o of the many Ab&s;urdities, Fal&s;hoods and Errors that were crept into the Name of the Chri&s;tian Faith,

<P>And if any <HI>Prede&s;tinarian</HI> &s;hould pretend to an&s;wer the Labours of this worthy Author, I de&s;ire them to tell the world whether Man be not a free Agent, that is to &s;ay, man hath a free Will to pitch upon his own Choice in things relating to his Salvation or Condemnation, either by his Creator or by any other &s;econdary Cau&s;es produced by Omnipotency, to fru&s;trate him of his free choice?

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that a Carpenter with great pains and labour did make a Cart-wheel, and when he had made it, gave it a command to get up and run towards the Sun ri&s;ing; it having no Power given it, it naturally lies &s;till, and di&s;o|beys its Makers command; and then the Car|penter under the pretence of its Di&s;obedience, to &s;how his power over his Creature, &s;hould violently fall upon his Wheel and da&s;h it to pieces.
