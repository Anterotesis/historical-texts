<Q><BIBL><HI>DEUTERONOMY viii. 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And thou &s;halt remember all the way which the Lord thy GOD led thee the&s;e forty years in the wilderne&s;s, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou woulde&s;t keep his command|ments or no.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the children of I&s;rael in Egypt, their &s;ufferings and oppre&s;&s;ion under the ty|rant Pharaoh, their remarkable deliverance by the hand of Mo&s;es out of that &s;tate of bondage and op|pre&s;&s;ion, and their trials and murmurings in the wilderne&s;s, is well known by tho&s;e who have been conver&s;ant with their bibles, and have attended to tho&s;e important le&s;&s;ons contained in the five books of Mo&s;es. But why God thus dealt with that people, perhaps has not been duly attended to by tho&s;e that have made con&s;cience of reading the &s;acred &s;tory. But the text tells us, that it was to humble them, and to prove them, that they might know what was in their hearts, and whether they would keep his com|mandments, or no. All the events which befel them in the way; the miraculous protections, deliverances, provi&s;ions and in&s;tructions which God gave them, and withal, the frequent and &s;evere puni&s;hments which were inflicted for their di&s;obedience, was to di&s;cover to them&s;elves and others, all that infidelity, incon|&s;tancy, hypocri&s;y, apo&s;tacy, rebellion and perver&s;e|ne&s;s which lay hid in their hearts; the di&s;covery of
<PB N="4" REF="015604_0003_0F99D4E0EC89AC20">
which was of &s;ingular u&s;e both to them, and to the church of God in all &s;ucceeding ages. For as Watts has it,
<Q><L>There, as in a gla&s;s our hearts may &s;ee,</L>
<L>How fickle and how fal&s;e they be.</L></Q></P>
<P>God, by them, de&s;igned to let after generations know what was in their hearts; but it is not gene|rally known and believed till it comes to the trial; and then it is found that we are prone to act over the &s;ame &s;tupid vile part that the children of I&s;rael did in the wilderne&s;s, under the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and &s;peaking providences that ever obtained in the world,&mdash;So that the notes from the words may be the&s;e following, namely,</P>
<P N="1">I. That the hearts of the children of men are na|turally the &s;ame from one generation to another.</P>
<P N="2">II. That God frequently brings his own people into a &s;tate of peculiar trials to di&s;cover to them and others what there is in their hearts.</P>
<P N="3">III. That people when they are proved and tried, generally &s;hew what they are.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The di&s;covering to a people their errors and wickedne&s;s, is de&s;igned to humble and reform them.</P>
<P>And then conclude with &s;ome improvement.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;hew that the hearts of the children of men are naturally the &s;ame from generation to ge|neration.&mdash;This is &s;o plain a point that I need not &s;tand long for the proof of it, tho' it may be profita|ble to illu&s;trate it by &s;ome examples; for of one blood God made all nations of men that dwell up|on the face of the earth, Acts 17, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> And this blood is under one common <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by guilt; for by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, Rom. 5, 19. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> apo&s;tle &s;peak|ing
<PB N="5" REF="015604_0003_0F99D4E0EC89AC20">
of the natural &s;tate of the heart &s;ays, that it is enmity again&s;t God, not &s;ubject to his law, neither indeed can be, Rom. 8.7. And our Saviour te&s;tifieth, That out of the heart of man proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornication, thefts, covetou&s;ne&s;s, wickedne&s;s, deceit, laciviou&s;ne&s;s, an evil eye, bla&s;|phemy, pride, fooli&s;hne&s;s, all the&s;e things come from within and defile the man. Mark 7 21, 22, 23. And we find this radical evil of the heart early breaking forth and exemplifying it&s;elf in the lives of all the generations of men that have been upon the earth, from Adam our primogenitor to the pre&s;ent race of men that inhabit the earth. Adam was ready to excu&s;e his &s;in by laying it upon Eve, and Eve upon the &s;erpent. Gen. 3.12. And we find &s;in &s;o deep|ly rooted in the nature of man by the apo&s;tacy, that tho&s;e horrid &s;ins of envy and murder early broke out in the family of Adam; for Cain perceiving that God had not re&s;pect to his offering as he had to his brother Abel's, was wroth, and his countenance fell, and &s;o ro&s;e up again&s;t his brother and &s;lew him. Gen. 4.5. And we don't read far before we find this &s;ad account, that all fle&s;h had corrupted their way upon the earth, and that the earth was filled with violence. Gen. 6.11. And we find the mo&s;t &s;ordid lu&s;ts and wickedne&s;s breaking forth in the people of Sodom. Gen. 19. And the &s;ins of bribery and oppre&s;&s;ion early taking place between Jacob and E&s;au, the latter being induced by the former to &s;ell his birth-right for a me&s;s of pottage. Gen. 25.32. And the &s;ins of envy and hatred prevailing in the hearts of the bre|thren of Jo&s;eph, &s;o that they could not &s;peak peace|ably to him, but con&s;pired again&s;t him to &s;lay him. Gen. 27.24. And we find the &s;ins of pride, tyranny
<PB N="6" REF="015604_0004_0F99D4E1AB5FAB10">
and oppre&s;&s;ion, together with the &s;pirit of &s;elf-&s;uffi|ciency and contempt of God and his authority in the haughty tyrant Pharaoh. Exod. 5.2. Who is the Lord, &s;ays he, that I &s;hould obey his voice to let I&s;|rael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let I&s;rael go. And after all the wonders Mo&s;es wrought, and the judgments again&s;t Egypt, his heart was &s;till hardened again&s;t God and would not yield. Exod. 7.8. Shewing that hardne&s;s of heart was an early &s;in; and that people would per&s;i&s;t in &s;in under &s;ore corrections and the evident rebukes of Heaven; this was exemplified not only in Pharaoh, but in king Ahaz, who in the time of his di&s;tre&s;s did tre&s;pa&s;s yet more and more again&s;t the Lord. This is that king Ahaz who is &s;o noted for his wickedne&s;s. 2 Chron. 28.19. And we find this temper not only in wick|ed kings, but in the people of I&s;rael under &s;ore cha&s;|ti&s;ements. Jer. 5.3. Thou ha&s;t &s;tricken them, but they have not grieved; thou ha&s;t con&s;umed them, but they have refu&s;ed to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refu&s;ed to return. And Jer. 8.6. No man repented him of his wickedne&s;s, &s;aying, What have I done? every one turned to his cour&s;e as the hor&s;e ru&s;heth into the battle. They were &s;o greedily &s;et upon their iniquities, that the prophet compares them to a war hor&s;e that with unbridled force ru&s;heth into the bat|tle. Thus greedily did this people ru&s;h into the ways of &s;in. And le&s;t we &s;hould conceive this to be the peculiar wickedne&s;s of this particular people, he adds in Jer. 17.9. The heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked, and who can know it? Tho' we have all the wickedne&s;s of the world to teach us what there is in our hearts, and our daily experience
<PB N="7" REF="015604_0004_0F99D4E1AB5FAB10">
to in&s;truct us, yet we do not learn the depths of wickedne&s;s that lodge in that cavern, till a &s;uitable temptation draws it forth into exerci&s;e. The chil|dren of I&s;rael were not aware ('tis like) of the hun|dredth part of the wickedne&s;s that lay lurking in their hearts, while they were in Egypt in that cruel &s;tate of bondage to Pharaoh. They were doubtle&s;s ready then to think, that if they could once get free from that &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, that they would &s;erve the Lord with chearfulne&s;s, and that none of his com|mandments &s;hould be grievous. But when they came to the trial, they found unbelief, di&s;tru&s;t of God and of his tender care of them, &s;pringing up in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t extraordinary manife&s;tations of God's power and goodne&s;s on their behalf, that ever were made to a people. And tho' they had been lately delivered from the &s;evere&s;t bondage and oppre&s;&s;ion, yet they were as impatient under trials, and as ready to murmur at any difficulties in their way, as tho' they had newly come out of the mo&s;t pro&s;perous &s;tate. Now if any one had told them while in their cruel &s;tate of bondage, that &s;uch were their hearts, they would not have believed them, 'tis like: Therefore God led them tho&s;e forty years in the wilderne&s;s to humble and prove them, that they might know what was in their hearts, as 'tis &s;aid in the text. And tho' when we read their hi&s;tory, we are ready to be moved with indignation towards them; yet we are acting over at this day the &s;ame &s;tupid part with them in the wilderne&s;s. We in this land are, as it were, led out of Egypt by the hand of Mo&s;es; and now we are in the wilderne&s;s, i. e. in a &s;tate of trouble and difficulty; Egyptians pur&s;uing us, to overtake us and reduce us; there is the Red Sea before us, I &s;peak metapho|rically,
<PB N="8" REF="015604_0005_0F99D4E29F3ED338">
a &s;ea of blood in your pro&s;pect before you, perhaps; and when you apprehend this in your ima|ginations, are you not ready to murmur again&s;t Mo&s;es and Aaron that led you out of Egypt, and to &s;ay with the people of I&s;rael, It had been better for us to &s;erve the Egyptians, than that we &s;hould die in the wilderne&s;s. Exod. 14.12. And tho' God has been plea&s;ed to work marvellou&s;ly for us at times as he did for them; yet if any new difficulty ari&s;es, and if things don't go on &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly as at other times, how &s;oon does our faith fail us, and we begin to murmur again&s;t Mo&s;es and Aaron, and wi&s;h our&s;elves back again in Egypt, where we had &s;ome comforts of life, which we are now deprived of? not con&s;idering that we cho&s;e our leaders, and that in obtaining any deli|verance there are great troubles and difficulties gene|rally attending it; neither con&s;idering that our ill &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es are owing to the &s;ins of the people, as was the ca&s;e of the people of I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s: We find them ten times as ready to find fault with their leaders, and to a&s;cribe their misfortunes to them, as to recoil in upon them&s;elves, and to &s;ay, What have we done? Tho' it was owing entirely to them that they were not delivered. And thus we in this land are murmuring and complaining of our difficulties and ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es at times, thinking our leaders to blame, and the like, not con&s;idering at the &s;ame time that we are practi&s;ing tho&s;e vices that have a natural tendency to de&s;troy us, be&s;ides the ju&s;t judgments of Heaven which they tend to draw down upon us as a people: See I&s;a. 30.12, 13, which I think a&s;&s;igns the moral cau&s;e of our di&s;a&s;terous events. And when we are favoured with a little &s;ucce&s;s, we are apt to be elated in our minds like the children of I&s;rael after the over|throw
<PB N="9" REF="015604_0005_0F99D4E29F3ED338">
of the Egyptians in the red &s;ea, and then with them to rejoice, and to encourage our&s;elves in the cau&s;e in which we are engaged; then we can tru&s;t, as we imagine, in God, and hope for his &s;alvation and deliverance: But let the &s;cale turn a little again&s;t us, our confidence begins to fail, and we grow di&s;tru&s;tful of God and his providence, and begin to murmur and repine.</P>
<Q><L>Thus the faithle&s;s Jews forgot</L>
<L>The dreadful wonders God had wrought,</L>
<L>Then they provoke him to his face,</L>
<L>Nor fear his power, nor tru&s;t his grace.</L> <BIBL>Watts.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Thus we are acting over the like &s;ins with the chil|dren of I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s, under the conduct of Mo&s;es and Aaron, who was leading them out of a &s;tate of bondage into a land of liberty and plenty in Canaan. Again, we are ready to marvel at the un|rea&s;onable vilene&s;s and cruelty of the Briti&s;h tyrant and his mini&s;try, in endeavouring to oppre&s;s, en&s;lave and de&s;troy the&s;e American States, who have been &s;ome of his mo&s;t peaceable and profitable &s;ubjects; and yet we find the &s;ame wicked temper and di&s;po&s;i|tion operating in Pharaoh king of Egypt above 3000 years ago. See Exod. 1.7 to 17 ver&s;e. When I&s;|rael began to increa&s;e in Egypt, the king &s;aid, Come on, let us deal wi&s;ely with them le&s;t they multiply; and it come to pa&s;s when there falleth out any war, they join unto our enemies and fight again&s;t us, and &s;o get them out of the land; therefore they did &s;et over them ta&s;k-ma&s;ters to afflict them with their bur|dens; they made them to &s;erve with rigour, and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, &amp;c. And afterwards they laid the burthen heavier, allowing
<PB N="10" REF="015604_0006_0F99D4EAC0CF0800">
them no &s;traw, and yet requiring the full tale of brick. Exod. 5.6&mdash;11. And when they endeavoured to make their e&s;cape from this cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive ty|rant, Pharaoh pur&s;ued after I&s;rael with a great army unto the Red Sea. Exod. 14.7&mdash;10. So that the Briti&s;h tyrant is only acting over the &s;ame wicked and cruel part, that Pharaoh king of Egypt acted towards the children of I&s;rael above 3000 years ago. But &s;ome may be ready to wonder, that &s;ince we are gone off from Great-Britain, and have declared our|&s;elves independent States, and in&s;i&s;t upon &s;tanding by our&s;elves, that they don't let us alone, e&s;pecially as they have pretended that we are but of little con&s;equence to Great-Britain. But we find the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition in the adver&s;aries of Judah and Benjamin, who troubled them in building, and hired coun&s;ellors a|gain&s;t them to fru&s;trate their purpo&s;es. Afterwards Rehum the chancellor wrote to the king, The Jews are building the rebellious and bad city; if this city be builded, and the walls &s;et up again, &s;ay they, then they will not pay toll, tribute, &amp;c. and &s;o thou &s;halt endamage the revenue of the kings: Now becau&s;e we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to &s;ee the king's di&s;honour, &amp;c. this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings; and that they have moved &s;edition within the &s;ame of old: if this city be built, by this means thou &s;halt have no portion on this &s;ide the river, and &s;o they ha&s;ted to Jeru&s;alem to &s;tay the work by force. Ezr. 4, from the beginning to the 24th ver&s;e. Now this was a right Tory letter and conduct; and Sanballat's be|haviour towards tho&s;e that encouraged the work of building the city, was ju&s;t like that of the tories to|wards tho&s;e that would build up the&s;e American
<PB N="11" REF="015604_0006_0F99D4EAC0CF0800">
States. See Nehem. 2.19. But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the &s;ervant, the Ammonite, heard it, they laughed us to &s;corn, and de&s;pi&s;ed us, and &s;aid, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel again&s;t the king? Thus there were &s;ome men then as well as in the&s;e days, that &s;eemed to look upon it as a greater crime to oppo&s;e the king in his mo&s;t arbitrary mea&s;ures, than to violate the law of the realm and of their God. And when Sanballat and others heard that the walls of Jeru&s;alem were made up, they were very wroth, and con&s;pired all of them together to come and fight again&s;t Jeru&s;alem, and to hinder it. Neh. 4.7, 8. And Great-Britain is now acting over ju&s;t the &s;ame part towards us in the&s;e A|merican States; endeavouring to prevent our build|ing our&s;elves up into Free, Independent States; &s;o that the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the world has been much the &s;ame throughout all generations.&mdash; Great men are generally proud, ambitious and a&s;pir|ing, di&s;dainful of inferiors, and apt to re&s;ent the lea&s;t indignities: We &s;ee this in Haman, an a&s;piring cour|tier, who when he &s;aw that Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence, was full of wrath; wherefore Ha|man &s;ought to de&s;troy all the Jews that were thro'out the whole kingdom of Aha&s;uerus; and Haman &s;aid unto the king, There is a certain people &s;cattered a|broad, and di&s;per&s;ed among the people in all the pro|vinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are diver&s;e from all people, neither keep they the king's laws; therefore it is not for the king's profit to &s;uffer them; let it plea&s;e the king that it may be written that they may be de&s;troyed; and I will pay ten thou&s;and talents of &s;ilver to the hands of tho&s;e that have the charge of the bu&s;ine&s;s, to bring it into the king's trea&s;uries;
<PB N="12" REF="015604_0007_0F99D4EC8A8E3D70">
and the king grants his de&s;ire. E&s;th. 3.5 &mdash;11. And the Briti&s;h mini&s;try have been acting over the &s;ame wicked, mi&s;chievous plot again&s;t the American States, as Haman did again&s;t the Jews, and we have rea&s;on to hope that they will meet with the like fate. But what I mention the&s;e in&s;tances for, is to let you &s;ee that the wickedne&s;s of man has been much the &s;ame throughout all ages: We &s;ee this in David's com|plaints. P&s;al. 10.8. The wicked in his pride doth per&s;ecute the poor, &amp;c. And Pla&s;. 35.20, 25. They devi&s;e deceitful matters again&s;t them that are quiet in the land, &amp;c. And P&s;al. 94.3, 4, 5. How long &s;hall the wicked triumph? Shall they utter and &s;peak hard things: They break in pieces thy people, Oh Lord, and afflict thine heritage, which frame mi&s;chief by a law, &amp;c. From all which pa&s;&s;ages we &s;ee that our complaints and trials at this day are nothing new: People have been oppre&s;&s;ed under the colour of law, as we are by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try; and have been mo&s;t cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed and in&s;ulted by tho&s;e that have been in power; and have been derided and laughed at by their enemies in their mo&s;t afflicted &s;tate.</P>
<P>I proceed to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">II. That God frequently brings his own people into a &s;tate of peculiar trials, to di&s;cover to them and others what there is in their hearts. Thus God tempted Abraham, when he put him upon offering up his &s;on I&s;aac, Gen. 22.2, 3. (i. e.) tried him with that peculiar trial, that he might di&s;cover to him&s;elf and others, what there was in his heart; whether he would keep God's commandments or no, however try|ing or &s;elf-denying they might be: and the i&s;&s;ue di&s;|covered to him&s;elf and to others the firmne&s;s and fix|edne&s;s of his principles to the glory of God and his
<PB N="13" REF="015604_0007_0F99D4EC8A8E3D70">
own comfort and &s;atisfaction; for the trial proved his &s;incerity in the cau&s;e of God, and that he would keep his commandments under the mo&s;t trying circum|&s;tances of obedience, that nothing &s;hould deter him from the &s;ervice of his God, tho' his be&s;t beloved &s;on, as a &s;acrifice, &s;hould be the te&s;t of his obedience. Thus nobly did the faith and obedience of this Father of the faithful di&s;play it&s;elf under the exerci&s;e of pe|culiar trials. And as Abraham, &s;o Job, was brought into a &s;tate of very peculiar trials as a te&s;t of his vir|tuous di&s;po&s;ition. God challenges &s;atan, the grand tempter, as to the integrity of this man. See Job 2.3. And the Lord &s;aid unto &s;atan, Ha&s;t thou con&s;idered my &s;ervant Job? &amp;c. &s;till he holdeth fa&s;t his integri|ty, altho' thou moved&s;t me again&s;t him without a cau&s;e. And tho' &s;atan was not willing to give up the point, but was permitted to pro&s;ecute him to the extremity with all his helli&s;h trials, yet Job re&s;olved not to let his integrity go as long as he lived; and thereby di&s;|covered to the honour of God, and to &s;atan's confu&s;i|on, the excellency of that principle of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: and as God is thus plea&s;ed to bring his own people into a &s;tate of peculiar trials for the di&s;co|very of their virtues, &s;o likewi&s;e for the di&s;covery of their vices, that they and others may &s;ee what corruption there &s;till remains in their hearts unmortified and un|&s;ubdued: Thus good Hezekiah was tried with a pro&s;|perous &s;cene to di&s;cover what was in his heart; God gave him a remarkable victory over the A&s;&s;yrians and granted him miraculous re&s;toration from a dangerous &s;ickne&s;s, and not only &s;o, but God gave him peculiar honour by an emba&s;&s;y from the great and potent king of Babylon; all which probably rai&s;ed in him too high an opinion of him&s;elf, as if the&s;e things were
<PB N="14" REF="015604_0008_0F99D4ECE9C16C30">
done, if not by his power, yet at lea&s;t for his piety and virtues; &s;o that in&s;tead of walking humbly with God, and giving the glory of all intirely to him, he took the honour to him&s;elf, and vain gloriou&s;ly &s;hew|ed his riches and precious trea&s;ures to the Babyloni&s;h amba&s;&s;adors. 2 Kings 20.12. To this purpo&s;e it is &s;aid, 2 Chron. 32.31. Howbeit in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the amba&s;&s;adors of the princes of Babylon, God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart; (i.e.) God withdrew from him tho&s;e &s;upplies and a&s;&s;i&s;tances of his &s;pirit, which would have effectu|ally kept him from that &s;in, and &s;uffered &s;atan to tempt him, and him to fall into that &s;in of pride and often|tation, that Hezekiah might know his own impotency and corruption, his infirmities as well as his virtues, that he might know that the great mercies which he had received, were not the effects of his own merits, as he might be prone to imagine, but of God's free grace. 'Tis likely this king Hezekiah, when he fir&s;t came to the throne, and was &s;o zealous for de&s;troying all the idolatry of the land, and &s;etting up the pure wor&s;hip of God in his kingdom, was not then aware that there was &s;uch wickedne&s;s in his heart, as after|wards he found when he came to be tried with a pro&s;|perous &s;cene; but when the warm &s;un&s;hire of pro&s;pe|rity came over him, the putrid matter that lay in his heart, began to operate and &s;tench forth: And &s;o a &s;uitable temptation will frequently draw forth &s;uch corruptions into exerci&s;e, as per&s;ons before were not aware of being in their hearts. This we &s;ee in a &s;triking light in Hazael, whom the prophet informed how wicked and cruel he would be when he came to be king, viz. that he would burn their &s;trong holds, and &s;tay their young men with the &s;word, da&s;h their
<PB N="15" REF="015604_0008_0F99D4ECE9C16C30">
children, and rip up their women with child, &amp;c. Ha|zael when he came to hear the di&s;cription, was &s;hock|ed at it, and re&s;ented the thought, as you &s;ee from his reply. 2 Kings 8.13. And Hazael &s;aid, But what is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this great thing? And yet we find, as a worthy author ob&s;erves upon this pa&s;&s;age, that the dog did it. He could not con|ceive that there was &s;uch cruelty and barbarity in his heart as to practi&s;e &s;uch inhumanity as the prophet pointed out: But when he came to the trial, and was made king, and felt the plea&s;ing power of having the world under him, as it were, then pride, in&s;olence, and a tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition &s;prung up in his heart, like noxious and baleful weeds in an overfattened &s;oil, to the de&s;truction of the de&s;ign of regal dignity, whereby he became a cur&s;e and de&s;troyer of his people, rather than a mini&s;ter of God for good unto them. But he was not aware, it &s;eems, when the prophet told him that he &s;hould be king of Syria, that he &s;hould ever be left to practi&s;e &s;uch inhumanity and barbarity as afterwards he was guilty of: Neither is it probable that George the third, when he fir&s;t came to the throne of Great-Britain, and &s;wore to govern according to the good and whole&s;ome laws of the realm, and i&s;&s;ued that &s;erious proclamation for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of im|moralities, would in a few years by a royal edict, butcher a great number of his be&s;t &s;ubjects for not &s;ubmitting to his arbitrary mandates. Doubtle&s;s when he fir&s;t came to the throne, if it had been &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him, that he would have practi&s;ed all that tyranny, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion which he has not long &s;ince gone into, with regard to the American States, he would have been ready to have replied in indignation with Hazael, Is thy &s;ervant a dog that he

&s;hould do this great thing? But we find he has done it to our grievous wounding, and to his di&s;honour and bloody guilt! He that &s;hould have been our fa|ther and protector, has become the bloody murderer of thou&s;ands of his be&s;t &s;ubjects! And tho' this &s;eems har&s;h to a&s;&s;ert with regard to one whom we have heretofore addre&s;&s;ed with the kind and honorary epi|thet of a gracious &s;overeign, yet I now boldly a&s;&s;ert him to be a cruel tyrant, who &s;eeks to govern us with|out law, without rea&s;on, or the &s;acred dictates of reve|lation; impiou&s;ly declaring that he has a right to give us laws binding in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. If &s;uch a prince is not a tyrant, I know not who de&s;erves the name! But he is only with that dog Hazael, acting out the cruelty of his heart and that of his bloody court. The &s;even abominations that have lain hid there, have now come forth like the locu&s;ts from the bottomle&s;s pit upon this land to di&s;tre&s;s and annoy it; burning and laying wa&s;te populous towns that were erected without any of his expence or patronage; car|rying fire and &s;word among tho&s;e who have been his mo&s;t peaceable and faithful &s;ubjects; ravi&s;hing the women where the armies have marched; exerci&s;ing the greate&s;t inhumanity and barbarity towards their pri&s;oners; freezing and &s;tarving them to death, &amp;c. and all this done by Briti&s;h troops, who u&s;ed to be famed for their humanity and genero&s;ity to pri&s;oners! Who would have thought that &s;uch &s;avage cruelty had been in their hearts? But the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> has brought it out to the di&s;grace of the Briti&s;h tyrant and his bloody troops. Some are di&s;po&s;ed, 'tis true, to talk much of the mercy and mildne&s;s of Briti&s;h government, to encourage people to &s;ubmit to their lawle&s;s claims; but I am never di&s;po&s;ed to look to that power for

mercy, that is devoid of ju&s;tice, but forever reject the cruel wretch, who for the &s;ake of a lawle&s;s domination, would &s;acrifice almo&s;t one quarter of the globe to his re&s;entment. I think the trial has di&s;covered what is in the heart of Briti&s;h admini&s;tration, and I never de|&s;ire to be again connected with that government, which in&s;tead of &s;peaking peace to us, and to our &s;eed, threatens death and de&s;truction to us and our po&s;teri|ty, &amp;c. But as the trial has di&s;covered what is in the heart of Briti&s;h admini&s;tration, &s;o likewi&s;e the peculiar &s;ituation that the American States have been in, have tried what is in our hearts; as the American Cri&s;is ob&s;erves, The&s;e are times that try men's &s;ouls; and many things are di&s;covered in the trial, which other|wi&s;e might have lain concealed in the heart; tho' as our Saviour ob&s;erves, Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh; yet &s;ome will conceal what is within, till a proper temptation draw it forth. The conte&s;t has been, whether we &s;hould &s;ubmit to the ar|bitrary, oppre&s;&s;ive claims of Briti&s;h admini&s;tration, or maintain our own rights, and repel force by force: va&s;tly the greate&s;t majority has been for the latter; and the general will is always &s;aid to be of the nature of a law; a &s;mall part of the States have oppo&s;ed the general will, and have openly taken part with Briti&s;h admini&s;tration: others have been more re&s;erved, and have waited to &s;ee which is the &s;afe&s;t &s;ide, in order to determine their conduct. The&s;e are men of no prin|ciple, only to &s;ave them&s;elves, which is the mo&s;t &s;or|did of all; for they will be on this &s;ide or the other, ju&s;t as the &s;cale is like to turn, for or again&s;t the coun|try. Now the&s;e are trying times to &s;ift men out, that they and others may know what is in their hearts; whether they will &s;ell their country and their God for

a little worldly pelf; or whether they will make a noble &s;acrifice of all their worldly goods, and even bleed and die for their dear country, and dear bought privileges: many have done it already, and many more &s;eem ready to do it, who&s;e names ought to be honoured and held dear in the annals of the American States, &s;o long as there are any to remember their deeds. But this will not be the fame of all that had their birth and education in this noble land! No, it will be &s;aid to the eternal di&s;grace of &s;ome, that in|&s;tead of &s;tanding for the precious land of their nativi|ty and its dear bought privileges, that they vilely betrayed it; and with E&s;au they &s;old their birth-right for a me&s;s of pottage; that they turned their &s;word, which &s;hould have been drawn in the defence of their country, again&s;t the father that begat them, and a|gain&s;t the tender bowels of the mother that bare them, and the loving brothers and &s;i&s;ters that &s;olaced them, and all the dear friends and neighbours that u&s;ed to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t them! Oh, this is an image too horrid and &s;hocking to look to! I turn from it as a picture too mon&s;trous to behold! and turn to one of a more diminutive &s;ize, tho' not much le&s;s de&s;picable than the former; and that is &s;uch as aim not to u&s;e the &s;word upon either &s;ide, but aim to take a part upon that &s;ide that will be&s;t &s;ecure their darling intere&s;t; their &s;ouls are &s;o immer&s;ed in &s;ilver and gold, that they would fall into that &s;cale which would weigh down with the mo&s;t penny weight! The&s;e are they that make gold their hope, and the fine gold their confidence, and deny the God that is above, as Job elegantly expre&s;&s;es it; Job 31.24. (i. e.) His provi|dence, that can ea&s;ily di&s;appoint them in their hope and confidence: Such per&s;ons tru&s;t that their money

and intere&s;t will &s;ecure them from di&s;tre&s;&s;es and trou|bles, and therefore greedily procure it, and then are ready to join with that party which they think are like to conquer; not con&s;idering that the events of war are altogether uncertain, and that that &s;ide which ap|pears the mo&s;t promi&s;ing at pre&s;ent, may be in a few days the mo&s;t gloomy and threatening &mdash;'tis not worth while under the mo&s;t promi&s;ing pro&s;pects, to &s;ay with David, My mountain &s;tands &s;o &s;trong that I &s;hall not be moved; for God may hide his face as he did from him, and then with him we &s;hall &s;oon be troubled&punc; But then we &s;hould always act upon principle, and be uniform in our conduct, committing our cau&s;e to God, who &s;its in the throne judging righteou&s;ly, and can &s;ave and deliver with few or with many. But &s;ome people have no notion about tru&s;ting in God; they ri&s;e and fall ju&s;t like a &s;hip at anchor with the ebbing and flowing tide. And the&s;e trying times are de&s;ign|ed to &s;hew us what is in our hearts; whether we will tru&s;t in him at all times, and adhere to the cau&s;e which we profe&s;s to believe to be right in dark and gloomy days, as well as in tho&s;e that are more fair and pro&s;|perous. It is no great matter for men to tru&s;t in God, when every thing looks fair and pro&s;perous; they then deceive them&s;elves, thinking they tru&s;t in God, whereas they tru&s;t in the fair pro&s;pect that is be|fore them. But this is the trial of our &s;incerity, when every thing looks dark and gloomy, according to hu|man pro&s;pects, then to commit our cau&s;e to God, and tru&s;t in him for a favourable i&s;&s;ue: This is truly tru&s;t|ing in God. And the&s;e &s;hifting &s;cenes of adver&s;e and pro&s;perous appearances, are de&s;igned to humble us and prove us, that we may know what is in our hearts. There is a variety of temptations ari&s;ing from our
<PB N="20" REF="015604_0011_0F99D4F2DFFF3150">
particular &s;tate and circum&s;tances, to draw out what there is in our hearts: There are many things to try us, whether we are of a public &s;pirit; whether we regard our country, our liberties and privileges more than our own private pelf; and &s;ome we &s;hall find &s;hrinking back from the public cau&s;e, avoiding all occa&s;ions in which the public calls for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while others le&s;s able mu&s;t bear the weight of the public weal or let it &s;ink. Others are tried as to their huma|nity and benevolence, whether they will a&s;&s;i&s;t others with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upports of life, when they can do it, at a rea&s;onable lay: And here, alas! we find the trial betraying what is in the hearts of many, even a wicked, oppre&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition, refu&s;ing to part with their provi&s;ion at that high price allowed and &s;tated by the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate; waiting, it &s;eems, to take the advantage of people's nece&s;&s;ities, to get a more exorbitant price. This is a wickedne&s;s prevail|ing in the country which we &s;hould not have imagined to have been in their hearts, had not the trial brought it forth. And God is trying us and proving us by all the variety of his di&s;pen&s;ations, that we may know what is in our hearts, and whether we will keep his commandments or no; whether the &s;abbath-profaner will become a &s;abbath &s;anctifier; whether the pro|fane &s;wearer will bridle his tongue, and leave off his profanene&s;s; whether the wanton and intemperate will become cha&s;te and &s;ober; and whether people will reform their ways, mortify their corruptions, and become new creatures. The land have &s;adly corrupt|ed their way; religion has been lo&s;ing ground for many years; and all manner of vice and profane|ne&s;s has become rampant in the land; and God is vi&s;iting us for the&s;e things with general judgments;
<PB N="21" REF="015604_0011_0F99D4F2DFFF3150">
and 'tis likely God will keep us in this wilderne&s;s of trouble to humble us and prove us, that we may &s;ee our errors, and know that God has a righteous contro|ver&s;y with us at this day. We are apt to think that our cau&s;e is &s;o righteous with regard to Great-Britain, that I fear we are ready to forget our unrighteou&s;ne&s;s towards God; and while we are endeavouring to get rid of the unrea&s;onable commands of an earthly &s;o|vereign, I fear we forget to obey the mo&s;t rea&s;onable commands of the rightful Sovereign of the Univer&s;e. Let us look upon the ground on which we &s;tand; con&s;ider our guilt and danger, and be humble for our &s;ins, and under all the tokens of God's di&s;plea&s;ure a|gain&s;t us on the account of our &s;ins, repent and re|form what&s;oever is ami&s;s in the mid&s;t of us, that we may be prepared for a deliverance out of our troubles; that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we may &s;erve God without fear in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s all the days of our lives.</P>

That people when they are proved and tried, generally &s;hew what they are: A &s;uitable trial gene|rally &s;hews what people are, whether virtuous or vici|ous; if they are of a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, a &s;uitable trial will generally bring out their virtues to public view; and if vicious, their vices. We have been ready to look upon our&s;elves as a virtuous people in this land, to be &s;ure in compari&s;on with Great-Britain, and &s;o to encourage our&s;elves that we &s;hould not be vanqui&s;hed on account of our virtues: But the trial di&s;covers that there is not &s;o much virtue in the land as we were ready to imagine; there is a va&s;t deal of wickedne&s;s brought out to public view in this day of trial; many we find will betray their dear bought

country for a little worldly pelf, preferring their pre|&s;ent intere&s;t, ea&s;e and advantage, to all the liberties and privileges of their future po&s;terity: And many who aim not to betray their country, are &s;o mercenary that they would imbark on that &s;ide that they think would be&s;t &s;ave their intere&s;t, without any regard to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the cau&s;e. And others who pro|fe&s;s to be zealous in the cau&s;e of their country, are &s;o fond of making a fortune, as we &s;ay, or of advancing their intere&s;t, that they become blind to the bleeding wounds of their country, and deaf to the cries of the poor and needy, and will not reach forth the helping hand to their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, unle&s;s with the iron hand of oppre&s;&s;ion to extort an exorbitant &s;um for their relief: Indeed the trial &s;hews that there is but little of a public &s;pirit prevailing among&s;t people in general at this day; the bigger part &s;eem exceedingly &s;elfi&s;h, &s;triving for the highe&s;t price for every article that they have to part with; and if they think there is a pro&s;pect of its arriving to a more extravagant price thro' the exigen|cies of the country, they will withhold it from the needy, tho' the &s;tone &s;hould cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber &s;hould an&s;wer it. Hab. 2.11. So that the &s;in of oppre&s;&s;ion &s;eems to be as ram|pant in the land as it was in Jeru&s;alem, which was &s;tiled wholly oppre&s;&s;ion. I am &s;orry to have occa&s;i|on to ob&s;erve, that our trials have brought forth this wickedne&s;s to open view in the mid&s;t of us, e&s;pecially as this is the crime that we are complaining of and &s;truggling again&s;t in Briti&s;h admini&s;tration&punc; but doubtle&s;s this is to humble us and prove us, that we may know what there is in our hearts. If this di&s;po|&s;ition had not appeared upon the trial, we &s;hould have been &s;elf-righteous and tru&s;ted in our&s;elves; and
<PB N="23" REF="015604_0012_0F99D4F47811C280">
have been ready to have thought if we had any &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, this was owing to our being more righteous than Great-Britain, and &s;o arrogated the glory to our|&s;elves. But God has been plea&s;ed to bring the people of this land into this trying &s;ituation, wherein they could take the advantage of getting an extravagant price for the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and upon trial they found it in their hearts to take the advantage and to oppre&s;s; &s;o that if we have any mercy &s;hewn us, we may know that it is not for our &s;akes: Agreeable to that, Ezek. 36.32. Not for your &s;akes do I this, &s;aith the Lord God, be it known unto you; be a&s;hamed and con|founded for your own ways, Oh hou&s;e of I&s;rael! But then oppre&s;&s;ion is not the only &s;in that our trials have brought forth to view, but the &s;ins of treachery, fal&s;|hood and deceit have crept out in one place and ano|ther thro' the land, in divers per&s;ons who would betray its &s;acred cau&s;e into the hands of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion: And others under the notion of being high &s;ons of liberty, will act without law and above law, and &s;o encourage and promote univer&s;al tyranny under the notion of a plenitude of liberty; for to govern without law is tyranny: for law is the guar|dian of liberty; &s;ecuring a people in their rights and liberties; and who&s;oever endeavours to &s;et law a&s;ide or to &s;uper&s;ede it, &s;o far endeavours to de&s;troy the li|berties of his country, and &s;o far to promote a tyranni|cal government. And yet the trying &s;ituation of the country has di&s;covered &s;ome to be of this complexi|on; and however high they may think them&s;elves for liberty, they are throwing down the very bulwark that &s;ecures it. But the trial di&s;covers another &s;ort of peo|ple, who tho' they are not for going again&s;t law, yet they are not for putting the laws in execution, which
<PB N="24" REF="015604_0013_0F99D4F6522BA068">
enervates government, and renders the law of no force; and &s;uch, however well meaning they may have been, have inadvertently fallen into an opinion that has proved very hurtful to the country; for the relaxati|on of the laws has encouraged &s;ome to act out them|&s;elves to the di&s;advantage of the country; the civil &s;word has not been a terror to evil doers as heretofore, and a prai&s;e and protection to &s;uch as do well; and the debtor has &s;hewn the di&s;hone&s;ty of his heart in re|fu&s;ing to pay his hone&s;t dues, becau&s;e courts of judi|cature have not been kept up in times back, to oblige him to do this ju&s;tice; and men have hereby been defrauded of their hone&s;t dues. And this is not the greate&s;t evil; for this has laid the foundation for the mo&s;t of that oppre&s;&s;ion that there is in the mid&s;t of us; for the country finding them&s;elves not obliged to part with their monies, feel not the nece&s;&s;ity of parting with their provi&s;ion, and &s;o withhold it from the con&s;umer till an extortionate price draws it out of their hands. This is a di&s;po&s;ition which we &s;hould not have thought to have been &s;o prevalent in the land, if the unhappy trial had not brought it forth: but we &s;ee and feel it to our di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion; &s;o that it appears that we have much le&s;s public virtue in the country than we were aware of; many being di&s;po&s;ed to take the advantage of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their country, not caring who &s;inks if they can but &s;wim; &s;ome &s;elling their country under the notion of advancing their in|tere&s;t, and others oppre&s;&s;ing their country in order to make an e&s;tate; and this di&s;ea&s;e has took place not only among the trading part, but has &s;eized as vio|lently upon the farmer and the trade&s;man as upon the former, and threatens the death and ruin of the coun|try, more than all the formidable force of Great-Bri|tain,
<PB N="25" REF="015604_0013_0F99D4F6522BA068">
and the whole tory faction in the land: and yet the&s;e would be thought to be friends to their country and con&s;cientious people. Thus the god of this world blinds the eyes of men; if they were not deluded by the devil and the deceitfulne&s;s of their own wicked hearts, they could no more think them&s;elves con&s;cien|tious and friends to their country, than the thief and the high-way man; for oppre&s;&s;ion is as much &s;poken again&s;t in &s;cripture, as the forementioned vices, and has as direct a tendency to ruin the country; for the&s;e things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of di&s;obedience. And when there is the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, and the &s;ighing of the needy in the mid&s;t of us, we can't expect any other, but God will ari&s;e to judgment, and make his plagues dreadful upon this land. We have been ready to wonder that Briti&s;h troops &s;hould be &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel to our peo|ple; but it has been ob&s;erved by &s;ome worthy di|vines, that God is wont to puni&s;h people frequently with &s;uch a kind of puni&s;hment as be&s;peaks the nature of their crimes: And our Saviour tells us, that &s;uch mea&s;ure as you mete, &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again. Mat. 7.2. And we have rea&s;on to believe that God thus permits us to be oppre&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h troops, as a righteous correction for the oppre&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition that prevails in this land. We were not aware that there was &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition prevailing till the trial brought it out. Trade u&s;ed to regulate it&s;elf; and in our peaceable &s;tate, when courts of judicature were kept up, and the laws of the State put into execution, things went on regularly, one thing an&s;wered another, and there was a con&s;iderable equality in our dealings one with another; &s;o that the poor were not oppre&s;&s;|ed, and the con&s;umer in general, could purcha&s;e the
<PB N="26" REF="015604_0014_0F99D4F6AE4D9F58">
nece&s;&s;aries and even the &s;uperfluities of life at a rea&s;on|able lay: But trade &s;topping, it naturally made the &s;uperfluities and &s;ome of the nece&s;&s;aries of life &s;carce and dear; and the war naturally made the circulating medium plenty, &s;o that we might have grappled with the dearne&s;s of tho&s;e articles, they being few, and many of them non-nece&s;&s;aries, if it had not fell upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life. It is true the farmer and trade&s;|man re&s;ented the high price upon tho&s;e foreign im|ports, and called it oppre&s;&s;ion, and were for making an in&s;urrection, to &s;eize their &s;tores at what they called a rea&s;onable price; and doubtle&s;s there was oppre&s;&s;i|on in the trading part of the country with regard to their foreign imports; but no ways equal to what there is now among the farmers and trade&s;men: It is like the farmer and trade&s;men then were not aware that they had the &s;ame oppre&s;&s;ive temper and di&s;po&s;iti|on with the merchant; but the trial has brought it out to our humiliation and wounding; Providence has put them under &s;uch circum&s;tances that they can take the advantage of the times, and they find an heart to improve it to as much rapacity and oppre&s;&s;ion, as ever the merchant improved it: refu&s;ing to part with their grain at almo&s;t any price, tho' Heaven has been &s;o bountiful in granting them &s;o plentiful a harve&s;t: they have the cries of the poor and needy again&s;t them, and they have rea&s;on to fear the cur&s;e that is denounc|ed again&s;t him that withholdeth corn from the people. Prov. 11.26. And in di&s;cour&s;e with them upon the affair, they will &s;ay, Oh, I &s;hould be willing to con|form to the ancient price if I could have &s;alt, or &s;ome particular articles that have got very high, at the an|cient price; making the extravagant article the rule for the common productions of the land; and &s;o they

oppre&s;s an hundred becau&s;e they are oppre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome one particular article; But they will reply and &s;ay, Paper money is not &s;o good as it u&s;ed to be: But I query why? If you have owed one hundred pound to a man, will not an hundred pound in paper currency pay it, as well as ten years ago? Yes, you will &s;ay, perhaps, but I can't buy &s;o much with it, as I could &s;ome years back, e&s;pecially of &s;ome articles, and there|fore it is not &s;o good. To which I reply, according to this, money will always &s;ink, when &s;ome particular article gets to be higher than u&s;ual; according to this, &s;ilver and gold may &s;ink as well as our paper currency. You can't buy &s;o much provi&s;ion and fo|rage in the city of New-York now, by one third, with &s;ilver and gold, as you could a year or two back, ac|cording to the be&s;t accounts; yet we don't &s;ay that &s;ilver and gold is &s;unk becau&s;e of that; but that pro|vi&s;ion is &s;carce there and of more e&s;timation there in compari&s;on with &s;ilver and gold, than u&s;ual: But that is no rea&s;on why every mechanic there &s;hould ri&s;e up|on the price of his labour. Sometimes one thing is &s;carce and &s;ometimes another, &s;o that we &s;hould mu|tually bear the&s;e inconveniences; But becau&s;e one thing is dear, to make every thing &s;o, is the way to kill and oppre&s;s the poor, and the many that have to buy every thing: So that the way that the country has precipitately run into, is not only va&s;tly impolitic, but very wicked and oppre&s;&s;ive, and forebodes darker things to this land than any thing be&s;ides, according to my apprehen&s;ion: And this avaricious and op|pre&s;&s;ive humour breaks out in &s;o many ways and in|&s;tances, that it is enough to confound and a&s;toni&s;h any con&s;iderate per&s;on that attends to it, and makes him fear the wor&s;t. But be&s;ides, the trial has brought out many other vices, which we &s;hould have hoped
<PB N="28" REF="015604_0015_0F99D4F77AD802B8">
were not &s;o predominant in the land, if the trial had not di&s;covered them. To in&s;tance in a few; the little regard that is &s;hewn to the &s;abbath by the &s;oldiery and others, who look upon them&s;elves a little at liberty from the re&s;traints of human laws; and that profane|ne&s;s that there is in our armies, rai&s;ed from the mid&s;t of us for the defence of our dear land, as well as a|gain&s;t people at home, at a time in which the land is involved in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es that ever it knew; and when there has been the mo&s;t expre&s;s prohibitions again&s;t profane &s;wearing, i&s;&s;ued from the highe&s;t au|thority in America. This profanene&s;s, I &s;ay, is very &s;urprizing under the&s;e extraordinary circum&s;tances, and which we &s;hould not have thought to have been in our hearts if the trial had not brought it forth. We u&s;ed to think &s;trange of Briti&s;h troops, that they would be &s;o profane in times of imminent danger; but we have rea&s;on now to turn the a&s;toni&s;hment upon our|&s;elves, and to be &s;en&s;ible that we have hearts as bad as they, and without the re&s;traints of divine grace we &s;hall act as &s;tupid and vile a part as the vile&s;t of them: And not only this wickedne&s;s has di&s;covered it&s;elf up|on trial, but a &s;trange &s;pirit of fal&s;hood has gone forth into the land, &s;o that it is very difficult to a&s;certain facts of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature as to our military operations; be&s;peaking the want of a &s;pirit of in|tegrity and uprightne&s;s in the land; all which forebode ill concerning us as a people; for if public virtue fails, and people grow vicious and profane, &s;elfi&s;h and oppre&s;&s;ive under the &s;ore&s;t judgments and calamities, we have rea&s;on to fear the wor&s;t; that God will mul|tiply our di&s;tre&s;&s;es and increa&s;e his judgments, till we are brought to a repentance and reformation. We &s;ee that God kept the children of I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s for many years after he had delivered them from the
<PB N="29" REF="015604_0015_0F99D4F77AD802B8">
hand of Pharaoh, on the account of their wickedne&s;s; and he led them &s;o long in the wilderne&s;s to humble and prove them that they might know what there was in their hearts; and one trial after another brought it out. And &s;o our trials in this wilderne&s;s &s;tate are bring|ing out our corruptions one after another, that we and others may know what there is in our hearts; what pride, what &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, what covetou&s;ne&s;s, what ingra|titude, rebellion, impatience and di&s;tru&s;t of God and his providence, all the&s;e come flowing forth from the mid&s;t of us under our trials, in as con&s;picuous a manner as they did from the children of I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s; which if it had not been for our trials, that have di&s;|covered them, we &s;hould not have imagined to have been in &s;uch a privileged, go&s;pelized land as this.</P>
<P>Which brings me to &s;how,</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the di&s;covering to a people their errors and wickedne&s;s is de&s;igned to humble and reform them. This is &s;poken of as being the expre&s;s end and de&s;ign of bringing the children of I&s;rael into the wilderne&s;s, and leading them there forty years, it was to humble them and prove them, that they might know what there was in their hearts, and whether they would keep his commandments or no. God did it not merely to bring out &s;uch a deformed character to view, as they exhibit under their trials; but that being brought forth, they might &s;ee their own wickedne&s;s and defor|mity, and be humbled and repent of this their great wickedne&s;s and reform their lives, by keeping his commandments for the future. And this is the end and de&s;ign of God in bringing us into this wilderne&s;s of trouble and confu&s;ion, that we may know what there is in our hearts, that being brought out to pub|lic view, we and others may &s;ee what a wicked people we are, and that we may be deeply humbled and a|ba&s;ed
<PB N="30" REF="015604_0016_0F99D4F828BDCB58">
before God on the &s;ame account, repent and reform. 'Tis not becau&s;e God delights in bringing &s;uch a deformed character to view; no, for it is more odious and irk&s;ome to him, for he hateth all the work|ers of iniquity, and he is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity. Hab. 1.13. A vicious character is like a noi&s;om &s;tench in his no&s;trils; and therefore when God brings &s;uch a character into view, it is that we may &s;ee the deformity and vilene&s;s of it, and that we may be humbled under it, repent and reform. Therefore let us be &s;ollicitous to get a clear view of our manifold guilt, and to be deeply humbled on the account of our own &s;ins, and the ma|nifold high handed abominations that are daily com|mitted in this di&s;tingui&s;hed land of light and liberty: That there is &s;o much of a di&s;po&s;ition in the mid&s;t of us to oppre&s;s one another, while the land is wading in blood to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t this wickedne&s;s in Briti&s;h admini&s;tration. Oh, let us &s;ee the deformity of this vice thro' the bloody &s;pectacles of tho&s;e parliamentary acts, that declare that they have a right to tax the American States, and to give laws to us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; and in con&s;equence of &s;uch a claim have &s;ent their bloody troops to butcher us, till we are re|duced to &s;uch a cruel yoke of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion: Methinks this &s;hocking &s;cene of oppre&s;&s;ion is enough to give you to &s;ee the deformity of this vice, and to make you flee from it as a mon&s;ter that devours with|out pity! And if you do not &s;ee it in this horrid pic|ture, look into hell&mdash;and there &s;ee Dives roaring in the fire of hell for a drop of water to cool his torment|ed tongue, for denying the crumbs that he had to &s;pare from his own table, to a poor, peri&s;hing Laza|rus! Methinks if people would look a little upon this oppre&s;&s;ive wretch in hell, weltering and ga&s;ping for a
<PB N="31" REF="015604_0016_0F99D4F828BDCB58">
drop of water, who the other day, could &s;wim in wine and all the delicacies of life, and was for pulling down his barns and building greater to &s;tow his grain in: I &s;ay, if they would look a little at him, methinks it would cure them of their oppre&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition, and open their &s;tores and their hearts to the poor and needy, le&s;t as they have refu&s;ed to &s;hew mercy, &s;o mercy &s;hould be denied to them another day. In &s;hort, any vice viewed in its deformity and de&s;tructive nature and tendency, is enough to &s;hock the hardie&s;t wretch on earth, and make him fly from it with as great precipitancy as Amnon's brethren did from the fea&s;t of wine, when they &s;aw their brother &s;lain there. 2 Sam. 13.29. Every &s;in is of a de&s;tructive, deadly nature; and if &s;in was thus &s;een and viewed, it would not be &s;o difficult to di&s;&s;uade people from it; but they view it thro' the devil's &s;pectacles, which makes it to ap|pear more delighting and contenting than ever it is found to be; and he blinds their minds as to the de|formity and de&s;tructive nature of it, &s;o that he may lead them blindfold down to eternal perdition: There|fore we had need take much pains to bring &s;inners to a ju&s;t view of their &s;ins; for till then they will not be humbled for them, nor repent and reform. And hence it is that God brings people into &s;ome trying &s;ituation to bring their wickedne&s;s out to view, that they may know what there is in their hearts and be humbled for it; and the trials that we have been under in this land, have brought out a va&s;t deal of wicked|ne&s;s which we &s;hould not have been aware of, if the trial had not betrayed it. And what is the end of this di&s;covery? Why to humble us, and to bring us to re|pentance and a general reformation. Let us then be &s;en&s;ible of the ends of Divine Providence in permitting &s;uch wickedne&s;s to break out in the mid&s;t of us; it
<PB N="32" REF="015604_0017_0F99D4F9189E3F00">
is to humble us and to give us to &s;ee that we have no cau&s;e to tru&s;t in our&s;elves,&mdash;in our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which we are very prone to, that di&s;claiming all con|fidence in our&s;elves, we may tru&s;t in him who rai&s;eth the dead,&mdash;and who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy.</P>
<P>Several u&s;eful inferences might be made from this &s;ubject, but I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one, with which I &s;hall conclude the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Seeing it is as we have heard, that the wickedne&s;s of man has been much the &s;ame thro' all generations, hence we may infer, that every generation may rati|onally expect the like puni&s;hments and calamities that have been inflicted upon generations back. The hi&s;|tory of the world is nothing &s;carcely but a hi&s;tory of the wickedne&s;s and mi&s;eries of it. Take the &s;acred hi&s;tory from the fall of man till Chri&s;t's appearance on earth, till his crucifixion, re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion to glory, and even from the mi&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t, till the completion of the &s;acred canon, and what do we find but the wickedne&s;s of man acted forth in a variety of &s;hapes, together with the ju&s;t judgments of God pur&s;uing it with a variety of calamities thro' life, till death &s;wallows them up in one undi&s;tingui&s;h|ed ruin! This is the general, melancholy account of the human race as fallen! Then have we rea&s;on to look upon it as &s;trange that we &s;ee and feel the like di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities with the world that has gone before us? Surely no. When we read in &s;acred or profane hi&s;tory of the unnatural wars that have ari&s;en among tho&s;e of the &s;ame nation, people and language, we are ready to be &s;hock'd at the horrid &s;cene, and to marvel at the outrage, cruelty and deva&s;tation that they will make of one another in &s;uch a conte&s;t! But if God did not re&s;train the wrath and wickedne&s;s of
<PB N="33" REF="015604_0017_0F99D4F9189E3F00">
mankind, they would always be acting over the horrid &s;cene, biting and devouring one another! And the wickedne&s;s of the Briti&s;h nation, I mean of the go|verning part of them, has arrived to that pitch, that they are di&s;po&s;ed to act over all that wickedne&s;s, cru|elty and oppre&s;&s;ion that Pharaoh and the other cruel tyrants of the earth have been di&s;po&s;ed to practi&s;e to|wards tho&s;e in their power: Witne&s;s the cruel and unnatural war that they have levied again&s;t us; burn|ing and laying wa&s;te many noble towns with a &s;avage barbarity and wantonne&s;s of rage; abu&s;ing the pri|&s;oners that have fallen into their hands, with wor&s;e than &s;avage barbarity! freezing and &s;tarving them to death with a relentle&s;s cruelty! &s;o that the cries of tho&s;e poor oppre&s;&s;ed pri&s;oners have entered I tru&s;t, into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, and that he has ari&s;en to avenge their blood upon tho&s;e inhumane butchers, who have come above 3000 miles to de&s;troy their neighbours that are more righteous than they! This is the nation that heretofore has been famed for their humanity and genero&s;ity to their enemies, e&s;pecially when pri&s;oners, that have now &s;unk into &s;uch a degree of cruelty and barbari&s;m, that they can abu&s;e them after they have &s;urrendered, cane them, &s;trip them of their clothing, and then drive them like a flock of &s;heep into pri&s;on, and there freeze and &s;tarve them to death! Oh how is the nation fallen and deba&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;ordid wickedne&s;s and inhumanity! and from once being famed for chri&s;tianity, their conduct would di&s;grace the mo&s;t barbarous nation on earth! Thus the wickedne&s;s of the human heart, without the re&s;traints of divine grace will act out a part not much inferior in vilene&s;s to that of infernals! But then tho' I thus inveigh again&s;t the cruelty and wickedne&s;s of Briti&s;h admini&s;tration and their &s;ordid troops; yet I would by no means inti|mate
<PB N="34" REF="015604_0018_0F99D5002B9EBF80">
that we are innocent, and free from wickedne&s;s; no, God has a righteous controver&s;y with us in this land; and our iniquities have arrived to that aggrava|ted height, that they have called for the&s;e &s;ore calamities that we feel! and the Briti&s;h nation are the rod of God's anger to &s;courge and cha&s;ti&s;e us for our &s;ins, as the A&s;|&s;yrian monarch was to God's people of old. See I&s;a. 10.5, 6, 7. Oh A&s;&s;yrian the rod of mine anger, and the &s;taff in their hand is mine indignation! I will &s;end him again&s;t an hypocritical nation, and again&s;t the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the &s;poil, and to take the prey and to tread them down as the mire of the &s;treets; howbeit, he meaneth not &s;o, nei|ther doth his heart think &s;o, but it is in his heart to de&s;troy and cut off nations not a few, &amp;c. Tho' this haughty tyrant had no de&s;ign of executing God's will and the glory of his ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing an hypocriti|cal people, but only to enlarge his own empire and &s;atisfy his own lu&s;ts, by &s;acrificing multitudes of people to his own ambition and covetou&s;ne&s;s; yet God meant to u&s;e him as a rod, and the in&s;trument of his anger to cha&s;ti&s;e and correct his &s;inful, degenerate, back&s;liding people; and we have rea&s;on to think, (let the de&s;igns of the Briti&s;h tyrant be what they will) that God de|&s;igns him as the rod of his anger to correct us for the foul &s;ins and abominations of this highly privileged land! Therefore let us be humble, ki&s;s the rod and accept the puni&s;hment of our &s;ins,&mdash;repent and turn to God by an univer&s;al reformation,&mdash;that God may be intreated for the land, &s;pare his heritage, and not give it up to a reproach,&mdash;but re&s;tore to us our liber|ties as at the fir&s;t, and our privileges as at the begin|ning. AMEN.</P>
