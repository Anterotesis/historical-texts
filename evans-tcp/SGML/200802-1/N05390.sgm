<Q>&mdash;Cornelius, <HI>a Centurion of the Band called the Italian Band&mdash;A devout Man, and one that feared GOD with all his Hou&s;e,</HI>&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALtho' the Per&s;on here &s;poken of, is not mentioned by Name in any other Parts of the holy Scripture, yet in this Chap|ter the Holy Gho&s;t does him abundant Honour, in recording his Name, and Character, and Conver&s;ion to the Chri&s;|tian Faith, to the Glory of divine Grace, and for the &s;ufficient Encouragement of the Gentile Nations in all Ages of the World.</P>
<P>It would be needle&s;s at this Time and foreign to my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, if I &s;hould take any further particular Notice of him, than what I am led to, by the Words read as our Text, yet I may in the Proce&s;s of my Di&s;cour&s;e have &s;ome Eye to &s;ome other Pa&s;&s;ages in the Context, which relate to him.</P>
<P>And if I am not mi&s;taken, the&s;e will afford us proper Matter for our Meditation and In&s;truction, at &s;uch a Time, and upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion a this.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006825_0004_102A3804F73FC0C8">
Here then, he is exhibited to our View, 1. <HI>As a Man of a Military Character, an Officer upon the Roman E&s;tab|li&s;hment.</HI> Cornelius, <HI>a Centurion of the Band, called the Italian Band.</HI> i.e. The Captain of a Hundred, or a Com|pany of cho&s;en Men, who were engaged and employed in the Military Life &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s, who were furni&s;hing them|&s;elves with Martial Skill, and fitting them&s;elves for, or rather had fitted them&s;elves for (for they were now upon Duty) the Service of their Prince, in that Employment.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;area</HI> is the Place in which this Company of Soldi|ers, under the Command of <HI>Cornelius</HI> was po&s;ted&mdash;A Place rebuilt by <HI>Herod</HI> with great Co&s;t and Charge, and beau|tified with rich and &s;tately Buildings, Ports and Temples, and many the mo&s;t agreable Accommodations,&mdash;He changed the ancient Name of it, which was <HI>Straton'</HI>s <HI>Tower,</HI> for that of <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> in Honour to the Roman Emperor&mdash;And it became the u&s;ual Re&s;idence of the Roman Go|vernour.</P>
<P>It was &s;ituate upon the Sea-Shore, and of great Im|portance to the Romans, to be well Garri&s;on'd, that &s;o there might be a Communication between <HI>Rome</HI> and the Places in tho&s;e Parts already conquered by them.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Cornelius</HI> and his Company were quartered here, and we may ju&s;tly argue, That he was a Man honourable and faithful in his Profe&s;&s;ion and Bu&s;ine&s;s, or el&s;e he had not had &s;uch an important Po&s;t a&s;&s;igned him.</P>
<P>His Company were all cho&s;en Men, Italians or Ro|mans by Birth&mdash;<HI>Watching and Warding&mdash;All holding Swords, being expert in War, every Man having his Sword upon his Thigh, becau&s;e of Fear in the Night.</HI> Cant. 3. 8.</P>
<P N="2">2. He is <HI>exhibited to our View, as a devout Man and one that feared God.</HI> Indeed the Chapter before us, gives us an Account of his miraculous Conver&s;ion to the Chri&s;tian Faith, by the Mini&s;try of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI>&mdash;But we are to con&s;ider him before this remarkable Event took Place.</P>
<P>And before this, he is &s;aid to have been <HI>a devout Man, and one that feared God.</HI> i. e. he was a religious Man&mdash;One that had come to the Knowledge of the true God; One that had ju&s;t Conceptions of the &s;upreme Lord and Governour of the Univer&s;e&mdash;
<PB N="3" REF="006825_0005_102A5A0D94A6ED20">
And one that yielded a reverential Regard to him, both, as to Wor&s;hip and Practice, according to the Light he had received from the Writings of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; the Prophets&mdash;It matters not how he &s;tood in the E&s;teem of the bigotted <HI>Jews</HI>&mdash;nor how he came to this Knowledge and Fear of God, whether by his former Education, when Young, which is not in the lea&s;t probable; or by his quartering among the <HI>Jews,</HI> which is more than probable&mdash;&s;o it is&mdash;He is termed, and he was, a pious religious Man&mdash;And herein he was accepted of God&mdash;And upon his Account is it primarily, that the Apo&s;tle of the Circumci&s;ion ut|ters him&s;elf as in the Context, v. 34, 35. <HI>Of a Truth I perceive that God is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons: But in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s is accepted with him.</HI> But,</P>
<P N="3">3. He <HI>appears to have been a pious Head of a Family, a devout Man, and one that feared God with all his Hou&s;e,</HI> &s;ays the Text&mdash;Tho', in an elevated Station of Life, and u&s;ed to manly Exerci&s;es Abroad, yet having his Heart po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Fear of God, he is de&s;irous that his Hou&s;e or Family &s;hould be well in&s;tructed and religiou&s;ly edu|cated&mdash;He was careful to exhibit a good Example to his Hou&s;hold, and to in&s;truct them, and train them up in the Knowledge and Service of the true God. He di&s;|dain'd the &s;ordid Practices of Vice, and walked him&s;elf, and aim'd at the bringing his Family to walk in the Paths of Virtue and Religion.</P>
<P>What an illu&s;trious Example is here! worthy the Imi|tation of Men in the mo&s;t exalted Stations, whether of the Civil or Military Order&mdash;Truly &s;uch Examples have a commanding Influence upon Per&s;ons in lower Ranks and Orders, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are more immediately in the View of them.</P>
<P>No doubt &s;ome of his Company were by his Example and Influence won over to the Practice of Vertue and Piety&mdash;To be &s;ure we find One at lea&s;t, to be devout as well as he&mdash;Thus we read in the Context, v 7. <HI>A devout Soldier of them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> And in Re|gard of his private Family, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Expre&s;&s;ion in our Text, <HI>One that feared God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> his Hou&s;e,</HI> puts

the Matter beyond Doubt, that the Fear of God was rooted in the Hearts of the &s;everal Branches of it, and was di&s;coverable in the Tenor of their Lives and Conver&s;ations.</P>
<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> all the&s;e Things together, with &s;e|veral other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in the &s;ucceeding Parts of the Chapter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> behold him in the <HI>Fourth</HI> Place, <HI>As a truly valuable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Per&s;on, and a Man of distingui&s;hed Ho|nour.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was honourable in his Office and Station&mdash;It is not likely that a Per&s;on of a mean Extract, of &s;mall Power and Capacities, or of a &s;lender E&s;tate, would have filled &s;uch a Place as this.&mdash;</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was valued by his Superiors, re&s;pected by &s;uch as knew him, and lov'd by &s;uch as were under his Com|mand&mdash;We may ju&s;tly think that he was prized for tho&s;e Things which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in common with other good Officers; but more for his manly, his pious, religious Conduct towards God and Men.</P>
<P>Such a Man could not but behave with an agreeable Air and Mein&mdash;He was full of true Magnanimity, and therefore void of Pride and Haughtine&s;s&mdash;He was Affa|ble and Courteous, Ju&s;t and Charitable&mdash;He was ho|noured by Men in general, chearfully obeyed by his Soldiers, reverenced by his Family and Neighbours, and much re&s;pected even by the <HI>Jews</HI> them&s;elves. It is &s;aid in the Context, v. 22. <HI>He was of good Report, among all the Nation of the</HI> Jews. But above all, he was highly honoured of God; having a Te&s;timony of his Integrity, his Sincerity, his Acceptance with God, given him by an Angel, a Me&s;&s;enger from God.</P>
<P>Honoured of God, in being made the fir&s;t Fruit of the Gentiles Conver&s;ion to the Faith of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>He lived up to the Light which he had before, and God vouch&s;afed to cau&s;e the Light of the glorious Go&s;|pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God to &s;hine into his Soul, and brought him to believe in the Lord Je&s;us with all his Heart&mdash;Thus, the Man &s;o piou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, &s;o faithful in his Place and Station, hath a more abundant Honour put upon him, and his Name &s;tands enroll'd in the &s;acred Pages, among the Worthies of Faith, and wherever the Go&s;pel comes his Memory will be revered and honoured.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006825_0007_102A5A0FDF959240">
Not that he by his per&s;onal Merit, &s;wayed and influ|enced the divine Conduct, in thus choo&s;ing him to the fir&s;t Rank in the Gentile Conver&s;ion, or to the Faith of Je&s;us.&mdash;</P>
<P>But for great and important Ends, the &s;overeign God was plea&s;ed thus to call him by his Grace; and being thus called, and cho&s;en, and dignified, his Character is worthy our Notice and Imitation.</P>
<P>Wherefore in farther di&s;cour&s;ing, I &s;hall attempt the&s;e Things following.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To &s;how, That the Military Life and Employment con&s;i&s;ts with Chri&s;tianity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That Piety and Religion con&s;picuous in the Lives and Deportment of Men, of the Military Order, render their Character the more bright &amp; illu&s;trious.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That altho' the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Soldier leads him Abroad in the World, and in the Field, yet it is not beneath him, but a bounden Duty to manage and di&s;cipline his own Hou&s;e or Family.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. That a good Soldier is much to be valued and honoured, e&s;pecially if he not only excels in Military Accompli&s;hments, but demon&s;trates a reverential Regard to God, and the practical Duties of Religion.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I &s;hall be as brief in &s;peaking to each of the&s;e Particu|lars as I po&s;&s;ibly can, and then proceed to &s;ome &s;uitable Application.</P>
<P>I. <HI>That the Military Life and Employment con&s;i&s;ts with Chri&s;tianity.</HI> However the Ca&s;e was with <HI>Cornelius</HI> be|fore he attain'd to the Knowledge of the true God, and whatever his Notions and Principles were then, with Re&s;|pect to his Employment in Life, is not material in the Point before us.</P>
<P>It is plain, that he hath this Te&s;timony, and is deno|minated a good Man, tho' a Soldier.</P>
<P>None can or will pretend to plead or argue, that Fightings and Warrings were not tolerated in and under the Old Te&s;tament Di&s;pen&s;ation, for abundant are the In&s;tances to be produced not only of Wars &amp; Fightings, of the People of the Jews, or God's People, both on the
<PB N="6" REF="006825_0008_102A381EF7F90A60">
offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive Part, under the particular Direc|tion of God.</P>
<P>But &s;uch In&s;tances are &s;o well known, that I need not mention them&mdash;Now <HI>Cornelius</HI> living among the Jews, and attaining to the Knowledge of the true God, and re|ally wor&s;hipping him to the divine Acceptance&mdash;and yet not laying down his Arms, or quiting his carnal Wea|pons, is an Evidence that his Bu&s;ine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted with his Religion; which was the true Religion, and the &s;ame with the true Religion now, only his Advantages and the Advantages of the Jews them&s;elves, were va&s;tly le&s;s than were afterward and are now enjoyed under the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash;And here lies the Stre&s;s of the Argument, whether Wars and Fightings, whether a mili|tary Life and Employment, are countenanced and en|couraged in and under the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation? And it mu&s;t be affirmed, that altho' the pure Precepts of Chri&s;|tianity enjoin Peace with all Men; and where they have a true and genuine Influence in and upon the Hearts of Men, &s;uch Men are di&s;po&s;ed to Peace; yet the De&s;ign of tho&s;e Precepts is not to eradicate the Principles of Self|Pre&s;ervation, but to regulate the Temper and Conduct of the World, and to make Men keep within the ju&s;te&s;t Bounds and Limits, in all their Conduct and Behaviour towards one another.</P>
<P>A voracious, Blood thir&s;ty, quarrel&s;om Di&s;po&s;ition, is utterly condemned by the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>To take up Arms, or to wield the Sword out of an avaritious and in&s;atiable De&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s that which a|nother Per&s;on or People are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and have a good Right to, is unju&s;tifiable&mdash;But then, if Life is dear and valuable, if the Lives of our Families are precious in our E&s;teem, and if civil, and religious Priviledges are &s;acred, and much to be prized by a People, then are Men called now as much as ever they were, to &s;ecure and defend them&s;elves, and their valuable Enjoyments of one Sort and another.</P>
<P>And in Order to this, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent Situati|on of Affairs in the World, in all Parts of it; con&s;idering the Cu&s;toms and U&s;ages in War thro' the World&mdash;It
<PB N="7" REF="006825_0009_102A5A1164802D60">
appears nece&s;&s;ary, that Men who profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity &s;hould addict them&s;elves to the military Bu&s;ine&s;s and Em|ployment, that &s;o they may be in a Readine&s;s to go forth to War; and that they really &s;hould go forth, when called in the Providence of God &s;o to do&mdash;And being &s;uitably furni&s;hed with Martial Skill &amp; Weapons, relying <HI>upon the God of the Armies of I&s;rael.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 17. 45</NOTE> They &s;hould be <HI>of good Courage and play the Men, for their People and the Cities of their God, the Lord doing that which &s;eemeth him good.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 10. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let me add&mdash;When the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> was &s;ent for by, and came to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and was <HI>to teach him all Things commanded him of God;</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Context ver. 33.</NOTE> Did he at all inform him that his military Profe&s;&s;ion was incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity? He certainly preached Chri&s;t unto him, and was in&s;tru|mental of bringing him to the Faith of Je&s;us&mdash;But not a Word did he &s;ay to condemn his Calling as a Soldier, which he would have done, exhorting and enjoining him, to throw down his Arms and quit his Po&s;t, if it were in|con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity&mdash;Moreover, when another Centurion addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to our Lord Je&s;us, and ob|tain'd that Te&s;timony of his Faith from Chri&s;t&mdash;<HI>I have not found &s;o great Faith, no not in</HI> I&s;rael.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt 8. 10</NOTE>&mdash;Chri&s;t him&s;elf does not condemn him for, or on Account of his Em|ployment.</P>
<P>And one would think that He would not have avoided it, if he had di&s;approved of it, &s;ince the Centurion ac|quaints him with his Situation and Employment in Life&mdash;<HI>I am a Man under Authority</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>having Soldiers under me,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 8. 9.</NOTE> From which Silence of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in this Matter, we may conclude, that he has le&s;t Men to &s;ome prudent Methods of defending them&s;elves &amp; their invaluable Liberties and Priviledges, by the U&s;e of the Sword; tho' the Precepts of his Religion are of Force enough, if rightly regarded, to reach them when, and how to do the &s;ame in a ju&s;t and lawful Manner&mdash;Finally here&mdash;When the Soldiers came o <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t with that Que&s;tion&mdash;<HI>And what &s;hall we do?</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Lult. 3. 14.</NOTE> It is mo&s;t likely he would have taught them &s;aying, Repent of your

<P>Therefore,</P>
<P>II. <HI>I am to &s;hew, that Piety and Religion con&s;picuous in the Lives and Deportment of Men of the military Order, ren|der their Characters the more bright and illu&s;trious.</HI></P>

<P>He &s;hould have a ju&s;t Regard to the per&s;onal Merit and Bravery of his Soldiers, and fill up his Commi&s;&s;ions with the Names of &s;uch as di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves mo&s;t by their Loyalty, Bravery, and good moral Deportment.</P>

And now,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If the Soldier does thus demonstrate his Piety and Re|ligion, his Character is hereby &s;erved, and his Honour rai&s;ed much in the World.</HI></P>
<P>Truly &s;uch a Character appears in quite agreable and beautiful Colours in the Eye of every Man, who thinks and judges right of Men and Things&mdash;Multitudes of Men in the World, and I may &s;ay not a few of the Gen|tlemen of the Sword, being too much wanting in the &s;uitable Expre&s;&s;ions of a true Regard to their Maker, yet can't but reverence and re&s;pect an Officer or Fellow-Sol|dier, who&s;e martial Accompli&s;hments are accompanied with the Marks and Evidences of true and undi&s;&s;embled Piety and Vertue.</P>

appear to be under the Influence of its Doctrines &amp; Pre|cepts; &s;o they look upon &s;uch a Man's Character to be peculiarly bright and illu&s;trious, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e of its being &s;o rare.</P>
<P>If a Man in his military Po&s;t, enterprizes &s;ome bold and daring Action, and performs &s;ome noble Exploit, and is crowned with Succe&s;s, he generally attains to the Cha|racter of a good Soldier.&mdash;But if it appear that his Cou|rage is rational, the Effect of Faith and Tru&s;t in God, and his Deportment is agreable to the Precepts of Reli|gion; his Character &s;hines with a peculiar Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The Courage of a bold and daring Soldier, who is as irreligious, as he is bold, is no better, and de&s;erves no higher Encomium than the Courage of the <HI>Hor&s;e which ru&s;heth into the Battle.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 8. 6.</NOTE> But to be valiant, and to do Ex|ploits, and to demon&s;trate a Regard to God, who <HI>is the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> and to &s;hew forth a Subjection to the Laws of God and Chri&s;t; this is truly noble and Magnani|mous.&mdash;Such a Soldier can't fail of obtaining a bright and excellent Character, &s;o long as there are Men in the World capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;uch a Merit from a meer vain and empty Shew of Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>But I may &s;ay &s;omething further to this Point under the la&s;t Head.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the <HI>third</HI> Thing propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>III. <HI>Altho' the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Soldier leads him Abroad in the World, and in the Field of Action, yet it is not beneath him, but his bounden Duty, piou&s;ly to di&s;cipline his own Hou&s;e or Family.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cornelius</HI> was one engaged in a military Life, and yet the holy Gho&s;t takes a &s;pecial Notice of his Piety &amp; the Extent of it&mdash;His Religion operated toward and di&s;co|vered it &s;elf in the Family&mdash;He was upon military Du|ty, and had the Care and Command of his Company, but yet was con&s;ciencious as to other Duties.</P>
<P>All with whom he had to do, &s;hared in the Advanta|ges to be derived from &s;o good an Officer, and &s;o good a Man&mdash;No Doubt it is de&s;igned for Imitation, or el&s;e there had not been &s;uch a Notice taken of this Part of

his Character as there is&mdash;Yea and if the Soldier is now inqui&s;itive, and &s;aying, <HI>What &s;hall I do?</HI> The An&s;wer founded upon this Warrant &s;hall be, Go and do likewi&s;e; Con&s;ider the Duty you owe to God and the King, in your publick Capacity&mdash;And don't neglect, but di&s;charge the Duties al&s;o which are incumbent on you, in your more private Life and Station&mdash;And to be &s;ure, let your Fa|milies lie near your Hearts, and &s;hare in your be&s;t En|deavours of Happine&s;s and Welfare to Mankind&mdash;There are Times indeed, in which the Soldier is called off from his own Family, and tho' ever &s;o near and dear to him, he mu&s;t march to his Po&s;t and Station, <HI>and jeopard his own Life unto the Death in the high Places of the Field;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judg. 5. 18.</NOTE> nor all the tendere&s;t Embraces, nor all the mo&s;t pitiful Accents of tho&s;e as dear to him as Life it&s;elf, mu&s;t &s;top him in his Pur&s;uits after the common Safety, and the De&s;truction or Conque&s;t of the common Enemy&mdash;In this Ca&s;e the be&s;t he can do, will be to leave them in the Hands, and to commit them and him&s;elf, to the Care of a faithful Creator.</P>
<P>But how unprepared for this, and in how poor a Man|ner can he commit either him&s;elf or the deare&s;t Objects of his Love, to the keeping of a faithful God, if he has been living in Carele&s;ne&s;s and Irreligion at Home?</P>
<P>If his Hou&s;e or Family which &s;hould be as a well di&s;|ciplined Company, is nothing more than a Cage of un|clean Birds, and his Con&s;cience flies in his Face and up|braids him for the Neglect of his own Soul, and the Souls of them, whom he ought naturally to have cared for; it is not likely that his Courage will &s;tand the Shock of a furious Battle; or that he will re&s;olutely fight for his Country, when he has already been unfaithful in his own more immediate and mo&s;t important Betru&s;tments.</P>
<P>But there are Times al&s;o in which the Soldier returns from the Field or the Camp, &amp; lives quietly at Home; and tho' he &s;hould not even in tho&s;e Times, &s;uffer him&s;elf to grow Effeminate, or &s;uffer his Sword to ru&s;t in its Scab|bard, and he him&s;elf carele&s;s as to military Exerci&s;es; yet in &s;uch Sea&s;ons he hath an Opportunity of minding

and regarding his own Soul, and of training up his Hou|&s;hold in the Way in which they &s;hould go, i.e. in the Paths of Vertue and Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>This is not beneath the Soldier, it is his bounden Du|ty&mdash;That Man's Notions of Honour mu&s;t be very fal&s;e, which cau&s;e him to think lightly of any Duty of the Chri&s;tian Life.</P>
<P>That the Care of one's Family, and the religious In|&s;truction and Education of the &s;everal Branches of it, is a Duty incumbent on all Heads of Families, whether in higher or lower Spheres of Action in the World, is as plain as that there are any Duties of Religion at all in|cumbent on us&mdash;Yea the mo&s;t high God puts Honour upon religious Heads of Families, let them be in what Stations they will&mdash;<HI>For I know him</HI> (&s;aith God of Abra|ham) <HI>that he will command his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the Way of the Lord,</HI> to <HI>do Justice and Judgment,</HI> that <HI>the Lord may bring upon Abra|ham</HI> that <HI>which he hath &s;poken of him</HI>*</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> the valiant Leader of God's People, did not think it beneath him; but it is mentioned to his Honour, that he re&s;olved to be religious him&s;elf, and that his Hou|&s;hold &s;hould be &s;o too; <HI>But as for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI>&dagger; And as I have diver&s;e Times &s;aid, <HI>Cornelius</HI> the Centurion, as he hath an honourable men|tion made of him in the Chapter before us, &s;o in parti|cular, this is &s;poken to his Honour in our Text, <HI>That he feared God with all his Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the fourth and la&s;t Thing propo&s;ed, which is,</P>
<P>IV. <HI>That a good Soldier is highly to be valued and ho|noured, e&s;pecially if he not only excells in military Accom|pli&s;hments, but demon&s;trates a reverential Regard to God, and the practical Duties of Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It may be remembred that I &s;aid, but ju&s;t now, that the religious Soldier could not fail of obtaining a bright and excellent Character, &s;o long as there were tho&s;e in the World, who could di&s;tingui&s;h between real Merit, and a meer Shew of Greatne&s;s&mdash;And &s;o it is&mdash;But it mu&s;t

<P>Good Patriots and Warriours, de&s;erve the highe&s;t Ho|nours that a People can be&s;tow upon them.</P>
<P>They de&s;erve more than empty Words of Prai&s;e, they de&s;erve &s;uitable Rewards, Rewards proportionable to their Services&mdash;And it is an Argument, of In&s;en&s;ibility in a People, or of ill timed Par&s;imony not to recom|pence Men according to their Merit and publick Ability, let them be in what Stations they will&mdash;To be &s;ure the Men who go forth to War, and do valiantly, and return with Succe&s;s, de&s;erve, from the highe&s;t Officer to the lowe&s;t Centinel to be honourably and &s;uitably rewarded, more e&s;pecially if they have voluntarily, kept their Hands from, or in Obedience to lawful Commands in the Camp, have not divided the Spoil and enrich'd them&s;elves with their Enemies Goods and E&s;tates; the common U&s;age and Cu&s;tom in War.</P>
<P>Indeed it may prove poor Policy in the End, when &s;uch Men and &s;uch Services are not &s;uitably rewarded&mdash;Men may grow di&s;couraged, and a Remembrance of for|mer ill U&s;age, may prove of bad Con&s;equence in any new de&s;igned Enterprize.</P>
<P>But it is al&s;o Ingratitude in a People not to honour and reward &s;uch as have done worthily, and been in&s;tru|mental of acquiring new Glory, and great Intere&s;ts, to a Nation or Country&mdash;And Ingratitude is a Crime as black and odious in a People, as it is in a particular Per&s;on.</P>

Heart and Mind &s;hould value the Man that hath acted his Part well, or gives &s;ufficient Grounds in and by his martial Accompli&s;hments, to hope that he would do &s;o if called to Action; and is withal a Man of Piety and Religion.</P>
<P>As War is &s;ometimes unavoidable, &s;o Soldiers are ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;And if there are tho&s;e that give their Minds to the Study of the Art of War, and are pious to|ward God, ju&s;t and righteous toward Men, cha&s;te, tem|perate and vertuous toward them&s;elves&mdash;And ruling well their own Hou&s;es, and not only yielding a good Example, but giving good In&s;truction, and maintaining Family Religion, Order and Government&mdash;Doing their Duty to &s;uch as are immediately under their Care&mdash;This as it encourages our Hopes as to their future Valour and Serviceablene&s;s, &s;o it calls for our pre&s;ent E&s;teem and Re&s;pect, and all &s;uitable Acknowledgments&mdash;Such Men will be valued by the judicious and unprejudiced Part of the World&mdash;They will live in Credit and Reputation; they will die regreted and lamented, and their Memory will be honoured by all &s;ober good Men.</P>

<P>Then may you expect to be re&s;pected while you live. Then may you quit the pre&s;ent Field of Action, when

<P>Let us ever guard again&s;t Envy, Prejudice and De|traction&mdash;Let the Soldier be re&s;pected by us in his Sta|tion&mdash;Let us commend his Bravery&mdash;Honour him for his Piety, and as far as our Power and Influence reach, reward his Services.</P>

<P>But Finally,</P>
<P><HI>Let it be remembred by all of us here pre&s;ent, in whatever Stations we be, that there is a War to be engaged in and pro&s;ecuted by every one of us, which is not only con&s;i&s;tent with Christianity, but which the Go&s;pel even obliges and animates unto.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 6 12.</NOTE> <HI>For we wre&s;tle not again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood

<P>By Rea&s;on of Sin, all Men are in Danger of being led Captive by Satan at his Will and Plea&s;ure, and of being ruin'd and undone forever.</P>
<P>The Devil is our con&s;tant and inveterate Enemy&mdash;By his Temptation and Solicitation we at fir&s;t revolted from God, our rightful Lord and Sovereign; and &s;o long as Lu&s;t and Corruptions remain unmortified in us, we are in the Service of this accur&s;ed Foe&mdash;If then we would return Home to God, &amp; &s;ecure and &s;ave our &s;elves from eternal Ruin, we mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t the Devil, and gain a Victory over our Hearts Lu&s;ts.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t difficult Warfare; but yet not &s;o dif|ficult, but that we may, and &s;hall (thro' the Help of di|vine Grace) manage it with Succe&s;s, and come off in the End more than Conquerers.</P>
<P>The Go&s;pel obliges all Men to this. The Go&s;pel gives us all &s;uitable Directions and Motives, and exhibits the be&s;t Example to animate us to, and to encourage us in the Combat.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t hath undertaken for us, hath waded thro' a Sea of Blood, hath fought for us and overcome.&mdash;<HI>Who is this that cometh from</HI> Edom, <HI>with died Garments from</HI> Bozrah? <HI>This that is glorious in his Apparel,</HI> and <HI>travelling in the Greatne&s;s of his Strength?

<P>And we tru&s;t, that tho&s;e who have not as yet &s;hared in the &s;ame Troubles, either Per&s;onally or in their Fami|lies, have had you in their Hearts, in their Prayers to God, begging that your Faith and Patience might not fail.</P>

<P>Will you each one labour in the Way of the Go&s;pel, to <HI>deny Ungodline&s;s and every worldly Lu&s;t, and to live &s;oberly righteou&s;ly and godly in the World, adorning the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all Things.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. 2. 10, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>Have any experienced the Mercy of God in their Per|&s;ons or Families? Let this draw and lead them to Re|pentance, and new Obedience.</P>

<P>Let all labour more than ever, to exhibit a &s;hining Example of Piety and Religion in their Lives and Con|ver&s;ations&mdash;

<P>It is much de&s;ired by them that wi&s;h well to the Intere&s;t of Religion, That Family Religion, In&s;truction, Order and Government, may be revived and flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>And indeed it is vain to talk of a Revival of Religion, or of a general Reformation, while Men in general con|tinue immoral in their Lives, and irreligious in their Hou&s;es.</P>
