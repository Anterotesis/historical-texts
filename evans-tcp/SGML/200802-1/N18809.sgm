<P>You know <HI>Voltaire,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all his ta|lents, was thought to be one of the mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent men in the world.

Did not &s;uch a writer as this, who had learnt our language, and &s;tole as much fire as he po&s;&s;ibly could from an author he depreciated, de&s;erve the &s;e|verity of critici&s;m? Yes, I pre&s;ume you will &s;ay; and an Engli&s;h lady, who had inve&s;tigated <HI>Voltaire's</HI> plays with amazing penetration, and cool|ne&s;s of judgment, gave the de&s;ervell laurels to our beloved <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> on due compari&s;on of their re&s;pective me|rit.

Providence has generally wi&s;e ends to an&s;wer in all its di&s;pen&s;ations; and it mu&s;t be ackowledged, that from the rich fountain of female learning, ma|ny u&s;eful and noble &s;treams have &s;lowed to po&s;terity; for no out but a cynic, or rough &s;atyri&s;t will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but that a liberal knowledge of letters may be of great advantage to women as well as men.

in women, as an endowment which will only help the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to be very quick-&s;ighted to the weakne&s;s of their opponents; and, therefore, like the Turks, they think that Empire &s;afe&s;t, which is founded on ignorance. It is noble in you, CANDIDUS, to declare, that you don't wi&s;h <HI>the tree of know|ledge</HI> to be monopolized <HI>by your &s;ex only;</HI> nor do I wi&s;h it to be by ours. A republic of women in &s;cience, would be to me as extraordinary and uncha|racteri&s;tic in private life, as in the &s;tate: All I wi&s;h is, that the daughters of the land (on whom much depends) might enjoy &s;imilar privileges with the &s;ons; for though it is not given them to ri&s;e &s;o high in the &s;cale of be|ings as the lords of the creation, that tran&s;mit their names to po&s;terity, yet as virtuous acts will confer more real honor than a <HI>name,</HI> why &s;hould they be denied it? Candour mu&s;t allow,
<PB N="10" REF="024450_0013_0FC74DEB0F9A5AB0">
that God nor nature has not excluded women from being ornaments to their families, however &s;ome have chu&s;ed to treat us <HI>even</HI> below rationality. Lord <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI> for one, has been very illiberal to us in &s;everal of his letters, wherein he treats us, "as tri|fling children, capable of nothing but wrangling and quarrelling&punc; weak crea|tures, that are bloated up with &s;elf-conceit, and fo&s;tered up by vanity:" For he further adds, "women have an intolerable &s;hare of it; no flattery, no adulation is too <HI>gro&s;s</HI> for them." We are not obliged to this great ma&s;|ter of politene&s;s, for his &s;arca&s;tical ob|&s;ervations, on the weak endowments and very narrow faculties of female minds. Had his lord&s;hip humanely con&s;idered, that it was to a woman he owed his birth, filial reverence might have induced him to have drawn a veil over female imbecillity, e&s;pecially
<PB N="11" REF="024450_0014_0FC74DEDC3D32428">
as it is allowed, by very competent judges, that a tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect for the fair-&s;ex is a criterion of nati|onal politene&s;s, and refinement of man|ners: But I hope the virtues of women, in all ages, have, in general, been <HI>&s;uch,</HI> that the bare mention of them will &s;uf|ciently refute &s;o cruel an a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>With due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Lord <HI>Che&s;|terfield's</HI> humiliating ob&s;ervations, per|mit me to &s;ay, that no man but one, who was governed by a contracted &s;pirit, and more &s;tudious to di&s;play <HI>wit</HI> than <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> could have been thus &s;evere upon our whole &s;ex. It mu&s;t indeed be allowed, that the pre&s;ent mode of education lies too much in ex|ternal qualifications, which, like an er|ror in the fir&s;t concoction, &s;preads its pernicious influence over our whole lives. The faculties of the mind are not properly exerci&s;ed; and whil&s;t genius is employed in childi&s;h amu&s;e|ments,

it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how much the &s;oul is curbed in her mo&s;t noble productions, and u&s;eful actions, in which the female powers are not taught to expand. I am certain, numbers of us are more obliged to nature and ap|plication for in&s;truction, in many parts of laudable improvement, than to all we learn at &s;chool. I &s;peak from ex|perience: We are forced to &s;truggle for the little knowledge we attain, as a &s;wathed infant does for liberty, that is pinioned down, body and limbs, by an injudicious <HI>nur&s;e.</HI> This being my ca&s;e among many others, I mu&s;t ab&s;o|lutely di&s;claim the courage you attri|bute to me, i. e. "that I have taken learning by force." 'Tis true, I have capitulated a little for it; but the <HI>fort</HI> is &s;o &s;trongly defended by your able <HI>corps,</HI> that, 'tis evident to demon&s;trati|on, it will not, in any re&s;pect, yield to my weak, pre&s;umptuous attack.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR la&s;t epi&s;tle to me is a full demon&s;tration, that &s;pleen have never &s;pread her &s;able wings over you, in re&s;pect to your opinion of female literature. You do me ju&s;tice in a&s;|&s;erting, that you don't think my am|bition leads me to leap over tho&s;e boundaries, that God and nature have &s;eemed to draw between the &s;exes, merely to be deemed a <HI>learned woman.</HI> Far, very far from it, I a&s;&s;ure you, my friend; that abu&s;ed <HI>epithet,</HI> I am very certain, is not the criterion of female merit. Prudence, Oeconomy, and an obliging deportment in the dome&s;tic &s;phere, I well know, render us far more plea&s;ing and u&s;eful in the private walks of life, than mere learning can do, without the former attainments.
<PB N="15" REF="024450_0018_0FC74DFF44248C00">
There mu&s;t be, as you ob&s;erve, a kind of <HI>&s;ex</HI> in the mind, that dictates its proper employment. I know your &s;entiments are, on this &s;ubject, corre&s;|pondent with our admired author's, that &s;ays, "that a <HI>Boadicea</HI> in armor, and an <HI>Achilles</HI> in petticoats, are ap|pearances equally ridiculous and extra|vagant." It may be &s;o; but that ob|&s;ervation does not depreciate the utili|ty and merits of learned women: Not that I am an advocate for the charac|ter of tho&s;e <HI>only</HI> that have been, e|&s;teemed <HI>learned,</HI> but for all others that have been, and are, exemplary in the virtues of cha&s;tity, probity, fideli|ty, charity, fortitude, and piety; and to approve the&s;e virtues are not whol|ly of the ma&s;culine gender, &s;uch num|bers under each cla&s;s might be addu|ced, as would compel an infidel to own <HI>that</HI> merit in our &s;ex, many of your's deny.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="024450_0019_0FC74E0284BF8BB0">
I will not pretend to enumerate tho&s;e particular endowments or ac|compli&s;hments, that have immortaliz|ed the names of &s;ome <HI>women,</HI> becau&s;e it may be thought holding out the gauntlet of challenge to &s;ome <HI>men;</HI> be&s;ides, the glorious li&s;t would &s;well my letter to a book: Therefore, I &s;hall only beg leave to introduce a few cha|racters to your notice, in &s;upport of female attainments.</P>

<HEAD>ON MARRIAGE; ADDRESSED TO A SISTER.</HEAD>
<P>To be a wife, Maria, &s;uch as I could wi&s;h you, requires more care, more temper, more conduct and &s;olidity, than young women u&s;ually pretend to; therefore, to become a wife, it were nece&s;&s;ary to become a new woman, in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of her conduct. The very great dif|ference between the ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of a lover, and the authority of a hu&s;band, will &s;et this in a proper light. To the mo|ment of your marriage it is your reign; your lover is proud to oblige you, watches your &s;miles, is obedient to your commands, anxious to plea&s;e you, and careful to avoid every thing you di&s;ap|prove; but you have no &s;ooner pro|nounced that har&s;h word <HI>obey,</HI> than
<PB N="83" REF="024450_0086_0FC74A74FAA84410">
you give up the reins, and it is his turn to rule &s;o long as you live. Then it is that he, very ju&s;tly expects an ad|equate return. He has &s;erved you with fidelity; and the laws of nature, the bonds of &s;ociety, and the injuncti|ons of religion, now claim your grate|ful obedience&mdash;not to the mandates of a tyrant, but your chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and plea&s;ing compliance to the &s;oft dictates of a friend, a guardian, and protector. Yet this is &s;o oppo&s;ite to the vain plea&s;ure of a rule, and &s;o dif|ficult to be reli&s;hed at the fir&s;t, that many young girls, &s;oon after their mar|riage, think them&s;elves ill treated if they are ever &s;o gently contradicted, and &s;eem, by their perver&s;e manner, to think eternal adoration their parti|cular due, and that their hu&s;bands ought to kneel like their lovers, and fawn like their lap dogs, to their lives end. This, however, &s;o far from &s;et|ting
<PB N="84" REF="024450_0087_0FC74A775538E068">
them in an advantageous point of view, or making them objects of envy or imitation, would only render the hu&s;band contemptible, the wife de&s;pi|cable. A quite contrary mode of be|haviour is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in every woman, who is ambitious of honor, or barely de&s;irous of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The moment a woman enters into the nuptial &s;tate, &s;he &s;hould look up|on her&s;elf as a new being, or rather as being in a new kind of exi&s;tence. She ought to look upon the trifles which before delighted her, with the &s;ame eyes as a man views the baubles of his infancy. The plea&s;ing levities, and agreeable fooleries of a girl, are particularly di&s;gu&s;ting in a wife, and very often receive a con&s;truction not at all redounding to her under&s;tand|ing or her mode&s;ty. The honor of a woman, and that of a &s;oldier, is ju&s;tly &s;aid to be equally delicate, it mu&s;t not
<PB N="85" REF="024450_0088_0FC74A78B9286E58">
be trifled with; but the reputation of a wife exceeds both; it mu&s;t not be injured, even in thought. Hence you may perceive, of what importance it is for a married woman, to attend to &s;eeming trifles, both on account of the unfavorable impre&s;&s;ions her hu&s;band may receive on her neglect, and what con&s;tructions a bu&s;y world may put on it. It is nece&s;&s;ary for her to relin|qui&s;h, in a great mea&s;ure, her young female acquaintance; at lea&s;t, to be careful of going abroad with parties of them, except in the company of her hu&s;band; for you &s;eldom know a knot of young females without their attendant beaux, who&s;e politene&s;s can|not refu&s;e compliments to a lady mere|ly becau&s;e &s;he may be married; and the&s;e compliments may &s;ometimes be impertinent, often mi&s;con&s;trued, and are generally improper for the ear of
<PB N="86" REF="024450_0089_0FC74A8493A39298">
a married woman. But the relin|qui&s;hing of all male acquaintance is an indi&s;pen&s;ible point, where reputation is regarded, and intended to be pre|&s;erved. Innocent freedoms between the youthful of both &s;exes may be in|dulged, before matrimony, without the cen&s;ure even of the mo&s;t rigid cy|nic; but after that, they become cri|minal in the eye of the world, and can|not be &s;uffered without a manife&s;t inju|ry to the character of a virtuous wo|man.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE TENDERNESS AND FORTITUDE OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH delicacy and ten|derne&s;s be the mo&s;t amiable ornaments of the female character, and are tho&s;e properties which more immediately in&s;ure our veneration, and command our love; yet is not fortitude in the hour of trial, nor fore&s;ight in that of danger, to be ex|empted from their other virtues.</P>
<P>The devotion of women towards the objects of their duty and affection, has been carried, in many ca&s;es, to &s;uch extremes of &s;en&s;ibility, that the weakne&s;s of their natures has been forgotten in the day of trouble, and when the body would have &s;unk had it not been &s;upported by the vigor of the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="024450_0091_0FC74A87C2E6D410">
How often have the&s;e amiable exam|amples of parential affection and con|nubial love hung over the bed of &s;ick|ne&s;s, for weary days and &s;leeple&s;s nights, without the &s;igh of impatience, or the murmer of complaint! The victims of &s;entiment, and ab&s;orbed by duty, how frequently do they te&s;tify their attach|ment, although, perhaps, to an unfeel|ing and ungrateful object, when their reward, alas! happens to be in&s;ulting language, and a breaking heart! How di&s;tre&s;&s;ing is it to &s;ee them &s;teal a&s;ide to wipe away, in private, tho&s;e tears, which, if publicly encouraged to flow, would &s;trike with contrition and &s;hame the unworthy partaker of their cares! Tender to exce&s;s, when tenderne&s;s is a duty, and undaunted to the extreme, when courage becomes a virtue; we &s;ee them collected in danger, patient of cold, of hunger, and fatigue; con|tent to &s;hare the &s;tony pillow or the
<PB N="89" REF="024450_0092_0FC74A8E86920990">
noi&s;ome draught&mdash;to de&s;pi&s;e the how|ling wind, the beating rain, or the lathing &s;urge&mdash;provided only they can &s;often mi&s;ery, and prove their love.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e trying and eventful mo|ments of life, when the balanced mind requires a coun&s;ellor to fix its re&s;olu|tion, and a friend to point out, and to &s;hew by example, the nece&s;&s;ity of for|titude; how often have women exhi|bited, upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions, in&s;tances of courage the mo&s;t heroical, of re&s;ig|nation the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical, and of a contempt of death, to be admired, at lea&s;t, if not imitated! and of this po&s;ition we have many vouchers in the annals of ancient hi&s;tory, as well as in the occurrences of our own.</P>
<P>The life and death of Portia, one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious, as well as one of the mo&s;t virtuous and accompli&s;hed of the Roman matrons, affords a ve|ry prominent, and, if I may be allow|ed
<PB N="90" REF="024450_0093_0FC74A900BB00120">
the expre&s;&s;ion, a very &s;triking ex|ample of the intrepid de&s;pondency of a female kind, which &s;hares in, and is determined to partake of the misfor|tunes of di&s;appointed and heroic love. The daughter of Cato, the mo&s;t re|nowned of the &s;enators of Rome, for au&s;terities of manners and integrity of heart; &s;he &s;eemed to have derived from the paternal &s;ource the dignity of a more than female deportment in life, and of a more than manly forti|tude in death: and the means that &s;he employed to rid her&s;elf of a painful exi&s;tence were unprecedented for their application and effect. So &s;oon as &s;he heard of the overthrow and fate of her beloved Brutus, &s;he &s;wallowed the burning coal; as if the exce&s;s of her virtue could only be mea&s;ured by the extremity of her &s;uffering.</P>
<P>There are but few characters in hi|&s;tory that excite the feelings of the
<PB N="91" REF="024450_0094_0FC74A95F073B790">
reader &s;o much as the unhappy fortune of Agrippina, the illu&s;trious widow of the great Germanicus. A peculiar tenderne&s;s of &s;entiment is always found to accompany her name; and the eye &s;eems to droop with compa&s;&s;i|on, and the &s;oul to melt with pity, whenever this virtuous and amiable mourner is brought to remembrance, and bears with a feeble &s;tep and a de|jected look, the urn that contains the a&s;hes of her lamented hu&s;band: a &s;ub|ject that has always been a particular favourite with the lovers of painting, and which will ever &s;trike and intere&s;t the mind of &s;en&s;ibility, &s;o long as the pen can immortalize, or the pencil charm.</P>
<P>The fortitude of Arria has been re|corded on marble, and adds, not in|deed an amiable example, but a &s;tub|born proof, of the undaunted vigor of the female mind.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="024450_0095_0FC74A9C513749A0">
Paetus, the hu&s;band of Arria, was a favorite of Nero, and to whom he confided a &s;ecret of importance, with a &s;trict injunction that he &s;hould not communicate to any per&s;on whatever, the nature of its contents; but &s;o &s;in|gular an affection did he bear to his wife, that he could not help committing to her brea&s;t the particulars with which he was in&s;tructed; but he &s;oon had occa&s;ion to repent of his indi&s;cre|tion, and her life, as well as his own, became the victim of her imprudence and breach of tru&s;t.</P>
<P>While the one was lamenting in pri&s;on the abu&s;e of confidence, and the weakne&s;s of love, and in moment|ary expectation of an ignominious and a painful death, the other found an opportunity to introduce her&s;elf into his pre&s;ence, and with a dagger, which &s;he had hitherto concealed, &s;he inflict|ed in her brea&s;t a deadly wound, and
<PB N="93" REF="024450_0096_0FC74AA132D5CF28">
then drawing out the fatal in&s;trument, &s;he pre&s;ented the point to her hu&s;|band, and accompanied it with the&s;e memorable words: "The point to me is &s;oft, but the wound that it will occa&s;ion thee is truly painful"</P>
<P>This kind of fortitude, re&s;ulting from de&s;pair, is unamiable, if not di&s;|gu&s;ting in it&s;elf, and partakes more of ferocity, than of that patient firmne&s;s, and affecting re&s;olution, of which ma|ny bright examples may be given in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>When Prince Edward was wounded by a poi&s;on'd arrow from the hand of a Saracen, in the time of the cru&s;ades, his wife, the beauteous Eleanor, with &s;ignal love and pious hazard, applied her balmy lips to attract the venom it had left; an in&s;tance of affection and fortitude without a rival, and which danger could be only ju&s;tified by the
<PB N="94" REF="024450_0097_0FC74AA2028ED8A0">
tran&s;cendant merit of the object for whom it was incurred.</P>
<P>The conduct of Margaret of Anjou, after the defeat of the Sixth Henry at the battle of Hexham, pre&s;ents a no|ble in&s;tance of female heroi&s;m; as the field of combat was at too great a di&s;|tance from the Scotti&s;h territories to permit the Lanca&s;trians to retreat with &s;afety, and as the country abounded with mountains and woods, they were not only annoyed, but frequently cap|tured by the enemy. The Queen, in her flight with the prince, betrayed by the &s;plendor of dre&s;s, was &s;urrounded and taken by a party of banditti; but while they were di&s;puting about the &s;poil, &s;he made an e&s;cape, and had not proceeded far before &s;he was again met by a &s;ingle robber; when, collecting all her fortitude, &s;he advanced towards him, &s;aying, "Here, friend, protect thy prince." The man, &s;truck with
<PB N="95" REF="024450_0098_0FC74AA4DBE4EA38">
awe, in&s;tantly obeyed the mandate, and conducted his royal charge to a village adjoinining to the &s;ea, from which they pa&s;&s;ed into the dominions of the Duke of Burgundy in Holland.</P>
<P>Many other in&s;tances of tenderne&s;s and fortitude, produced by in&s;tinctive or acquired love, might be adduced to the honor of the female character, in the exalted &s;ituations of life: and even in the more humble and neglected ha|bits of &s;ociety, the affection and at|tachment of women, although &s;ur|rounded by di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, have not been without the excitements of applau&s;e and imatation; for virtue is often concealed by rags, and greatne&s;s of &s;oul confined by want of action.</P>
<P>Do we not frequently ob&s;erve the&s;e amiable ornaments of human nature, the&s;e refiners of our plea&s;ures and a|menders of our hearts, who&s;e tender|ne&s;s &s;oftens the rigor, and who&s;e for|titude

in&s;tructs us to bear the rebuffs of life;&mdash;do we not frequently &s;ee the&s;e angelic con&s;olers watch over, with care and per&s;everence, the bodily &s;uffering; and endeavor, by the elo|quence of tears, and the energy of words, to divert the merited afflic|tions of a worthle&s;s hu&s;band, a cruel parent, or a profligated and ungrateful &s;on!</P>
<P>However painful the knowledge of infidelity and the abu&s;e of tenderne&s;s may be, yet is there an un&s;peakable comfort to be derived from the wil|ling performance of moral duties, be the objects of them ever &s;o unde&s;erving of regard: and he who can affix a ge|neral cen&s;ure of inhumanity, or want of &s;entiment, upon that &s;ex, from whom our principal comforts in life are derived, ought to live forever ex|empted from tho&s;e delights, which a rational intercour&s;e of thought, and a

<HEAD>ON CONVERSATION: FROM MISS MORE'S ESSAYS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been advi&s;ed, and by very re|&s;pectable authorities too, that in conver&s;ation, women &s;hould carefully conceal any knowledge or learning they may happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s. I own with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that I do not &s;ee ei|ther the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of this advice. For if a young lady has that di&s;cretion and mode&s;ty, without which all knowledge is little worth, &s;he will never make an ostentatious parade of it, becau&s;e &s;he will rather be intent on acquiring more, than on di&s;playing what &s;he has.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s to know why a young female is in&s;tructed to exhibit, in the mo&s;t advantageous point of view, her
<PB N="99" REF="024450_0102_0FC74AB57B023F38">
&s;kill in mu&s;ic, her &s;inging, dancing, ta&s;te in dre&s;s, and her acquaintance with the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable games and amu&s;ements, while her piety is to be anxiou&s;ly concealed, and her know|ledge affectedly di&s;avowed, le&s;t the for|mer &s;hould draw on her the appella|tion of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, or the latter that of a pedant.</P>
<P>In regard to knowledge, why &s;hould &s;he for ever affect to be on her guard, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be found guilty of a &s;mall portion of it? She need be the le&s;s &s;olicitous about it, as it &s;eldom proves to be &s;o very con&s;iderable as to excite a&s;toni&s;hment or admiration: for, after all the acqui&s;itions which her talents and her &s;tudies have ena|bled her to make, &s;he will, generally &s;peaking, be found to have le&s;s of what is called <HI>learning,</HI> than a common &s;chool boy.</P>
<P>It would be to the la&s;t degree pre|&s;umptuous
<PB N="100" REF="024450_0103_0FC74AB70F23ABE0">
and ab&s;urd, for a young woman to pretend to give the <HI>ton</HI> to the company&mdash;to interrupt the plea|&s;ure of others, and her own opportu|nity of improvement, by talking when &s;he ought to li&s;ten&mdash;or to introduce &s;ubjects out of the common road, in order to &s;how her own wit, or to expo&s;e the want of it in others: but were the &s;ex to be totally &s;ilent when any topic of literature happens to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in their pre&s;ence, conver&s;ati|on would lo&s;e much of its vivacity, and &s;ociety would be robbed of one of its mo&s;t intere&s;ting charms.</P>
<P>How ea&s;ily and effectually may a well-bred woman promote the mo&s;t u&s;eful and elegant conver&s;ation, almo&s;t without &s;peaking a word! for the modes of &s;peech are &s;carcely more va|riable than the modes of &s;ilence.

perhaps as &s;eparately marked, and as di&s;tinctly expre&s;&s;ed, as the &s;ame feel|ings could have been by the mo&s;t un|equivocal language. A woman, in a company where &s;he has the lea&s;t in|fluence, may promote any &s;ubject by a profound and invariable attention, which &s;hows that &s;he is plea&s;ed with it, and by an illuminated countenance, which proves &s;he under&s;tands it.

inattention, or whi&s;pering of &s;illy girls, who&s;e wearine&s;s betrays their igno|rance, and who&s;e impatience expo&s;es their ill-breeding. A polite man, however deeply intere&s;ted in the &s;ub|ject on which he is conver&s;ing, catches at the &s;lighte&s;t hint to have done: a look is a &s;ufficient intimation, and if a pretty &s;impleton, who &s;its near him, &s;eems <HI>di&s;traite,</HI> he puts an end to his remarks, to the great regret of the rea|&s;onable part of the company, who per|haps might have gained more improve|ment by the continuance of &s;uch a con|ver&s;ation, than a week's reading would have yielded them: for it is &s;uch com|pany as this, that give an edge to each other's wit, "as iron &s;harpeneth iron."</P>

<P>There is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than

knowledge, this is wit, the mo&s;t capti|vating, but the mo&s;t dreaded of all ta|lents: the mo&s;t dangerous to tho&s;e who have it, and the mo&s;t feared by tho&s;e who have it not. Though it is again&s;t all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abu&s;e this charming quality. He who is grown rich with|out it, in &s;afe and &s;ober dulne&s;s, &s;huns it as a di&s;ea&s;e, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomitant. The morali&s;t di&s;claims again&s;t it, as the &s;ource of irregularity; and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankrupt|cy it&s;elf; for he con&s;iders it as the pa|rent of extravagance and beggary. The cynic will a&s;k of what u&s;e it is! Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower garden, and yet it is allowed as an object of innocent amu&s;ement and delightful recreation, A woman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this quality, has received a mo&s;t dangerous pre&s;ent, perhaps not

<P>This talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as wit is the immediate property of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and learning is only an ac|quaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more dan|ger, that we &s;hould be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</P>
<P>But wit, like learning, is not near &s;o common a thing as is imagined. Let not, therefore, a young lady be alarmed at the acutene&s;s of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge.

<P>Le&s;t the flattery of her acquaintance, or an overweening opinion of her own qualifications, &s;hould lead &s;ome vain and petulant girl into a fal&s;e notion that &s;he has a great deal of wit, when &s;he has only a redundancy of animal &s;pirits, &s;he may not find it u&s;ele&s;s to attend to the definition of this quality, by one who had as large a portion of it, as mo&s;t individuals could ever boa&s;t:

But tho&s;e who actually po&s;&s;e&s;s this rare talent, cannot be too ab&s;tinent in the u&s;e of it.

Not to offend is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards plea&s;ing.

<P>But nothing, in general, can end le&s;s delightfully than the&s;e &s;ublime at|tachments, even where no acts of &s;e|duction are ever practi&s;ed, but they are &s;uffered, like mere &s;ublunary con|nexions, to terminate in the vulgar ca|ta&s;trophe of marriage. That wealth, which lately &s;eemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover, now appears to be the principal attrac|tion in the eyes of the hu&s;band: and he, who but a few &s;hort weeks before, in a tran&s;port of &s;entimental genero&s;i|ty, wi&s;hed her to have been a village maid, with no portion but her crook

A violent intimacy en&s;ues, or, to &s;peak the language of &s;entiment, an intimate union of &s;ouls immediately takes place, which is wrought to the highe&s;t pitch, by a &s;ecret and volumi|nous corre&s;pondence, though they live in the &s;ame &s;treet, or perhaps in the &s;ame hou&s;e.

which is very delightful. For a pro|hibited corre&s;pondence is one of the great incidents of a &s;entimental life&mdash;and a letter clande&s;tinely received, the &s;upreme felicity of a &s;entimental lady.</P>
<P>Nothing can equal the a&s;toni&s;hment of the&s;e &s;oaring &s;pirits, when their plain friends or prudent relations pre&s;ume to remon&s;trate with them on any impropriety in their conduct. But if the&s;e worthy people happen to be &s;omewhat advanced in life, their contempt is then a little &s;oftened by pity, at the reflection that &s;uch very antiquated, poor creatures &s;hould pre|tend to judge what is fit or unfit, for ladies of their great refinement, &s;en&s;e, and reading. They con&s;ider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the &s;ub|lime plea&s;ures of a dilicate and exalt|ed pa&s;&s;ion; as tyrants who&s;e authority is to be contemned, and as &s;pies who&s;e vigilance is to be eluded. The pru|dence
<PB N="135" REF="024450_0138_0FC74B3A275D8B90">
of the&s;e worthy friends they term &s;u&s;picion, and their experience dotage. For they are per&s;uaded, that the face of things has &s;o totally chang|ed, &s;ince their parents were young, that though they might then judge tolera|bly for them&s;elves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of know|ledge and ob&s;ervation; by no means qualified to direct their more enlight|ened daughters; who, if they have made a great progre&s;s in the &s;entimen|tal walk, will be no more influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pin|ner, or her brocade &s;uit.</P>
<P>But young people never &s;how their folly and ignorance more con&s;picuou&s;|ly, than by this over confidence in their own judgment, and this haughty di&s;dain of the opinion of tho&s;e who have known more days. Youth has a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, which it
<PB N="136" REF="024450_0139_0FC74B3B1283CAB8">
is apt to mi&s;take for an acutene&s;s of pe|netration. But youth, like cunning, though very conceited, is very &s;hort|&s;ighted, and never more &s;o than when it di&s;regards the in&s;tructions of the wi&s;e, and the admonitions of the aged. The &s;ame vices and follies influenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and nearly in the &s;ame manner. One, who well knew the world and its various vanities, has &s;aid: <Q>The thing which hath been, it is that which &s;hall be, and that which is done is that which &s;hall be done, and there is no new thing un|der the &s;un.</Q></P>
<P>It is al&s;o a part of the &s;entimental character, to imagine that none but the young, and the beautiful have any right to the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, or e|ven to the common benefits and ble&s;|&s;ings of life. Ladies of this turn al&s;o affect the mo&s;t lofty di&s;regard for u&s;e|ful
<PB N="137" REF="024450_0140_0FC74B3CB4879608">
qualities and dome&s;tic virtues, and this is a natural con&s;equence; for as this &s;ort of &s;entiment, is only a word for idlene&s;s, &s;he who is con&s;tantly and u&s;efully employed, has neither lei&s;ure nor propen&s;ity to cultivate it.</P>
<P>A &s;entimental lady principally va|lues her&s;elf on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of think|ing. This &s;uperiority of &s;oul chiefly manife&s;ts it&s;elf in the contempt of the&s;e minute delicacies, and little decorums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to re&s;train the levity of the young|er part of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>Perhaps the error here complained of, originates in mi&s;taking <HI>&s;entiment</HI> and <HI>principle</HI> for each other. Now I conceive them to be extremely differ|ent. Sentiment is the virtue of <HI>ideas,</HI> and principle the virtue of <HI>action.</HI> Sentiment has its &s;eat in the head, prin|ciple

in the heart.

Sentiment refines away the &s;implicity of truth and the plainne&s;s of piety; and, as a celebrated wit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voltaire's Prophecy concerning Rou&s;|&s;eau.</NOTE> has remarked of his no le&s;s celebrated co|temporary, gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds.

(not the &s;ort I have been de&s;cribing) may be &s;o connected with principle, as to be&s;tow on it its brighte&s;t lu&s;tre, and its mo&s;t captivating graces. And enthu&s;ia&s;m is &s;o far from being di&s;a|greeable, that a portion of it is per|haps indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary in an en|gaging woman. But it mu&s;t be the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the heart, not of the &s;en&s;es. It mu&s;t be the enthu&s;ia&s;m which grows up with a feeling mind, and is cheri&s;hed by a virtuous educa|tion&mdash;not that which is compounded of irregular pa&s;&s;ions, and artificially refined by books of unnatural fiction and improbable adventure. I will e|ven go &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatne&s;s of &s;oul, or true elevation of principle, if &s;he has not a tincture of what the vulgar call Romance, but which per|&s;ons of a certain way of thinking will di&s;cern to proceed from tho&s;e fine

feelings, and that charming &s;en&s;ibility, without which, though a woman may be worthy, yet &s;he can never be ami|able.</P>
<P>But this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it into incon|veniences, from which le&s;s intere&s;ting characters are happily exempt. Young women of &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility may be car|ried by the very amiablene&s;s of this temper, into the mo&s;t alarming ex|tremes. Their ta&s;tes are pa&s;&s;ions. They love and hate with all their hearts, and &s;carcely &s;uffer them&s;elves to feel a rea&s;onable preference, before it &s;trengthens into a violent attachment.</P>
<P>When an innocent girl, of this open, tru&s;ting, tender heart, happens to meet with one of her own &s;ex and age, who&s;e addre&s;s and manners are enga|ging, &s;he is in&s;tantly &s;eized with an ar|dent de&s;ire to commence a friend&s;hip

She is per&s;uaded, that her new friend unites them all in her&s;elf, becau&s;e &s;he carries in her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing countenance the promi&s;e of them all. How cruel and how cen&s;orious would this inexperienced girl think her mo|ther was, who &s;hould venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had de|fects in her temper, or exceptions in her character! She would mi&s;take the&s;e hints of di&s;cretion for the in&s;inu|ations of an uncharitable di&s;po&s;ition.
<PB N="146" REF="024450_0149_0FC74B5D860E56B8">
At fir&s;t &s;he would perhaps li&s;ten to them with a generous impatience, and afterwards with a cold and &s;ilent di&s;|dain. She would de&s;pi&s;e them as the effect of prejudice, mi&s;repre&s;entation, or ignorance. The more aggravated the cen&s;ure, the more vehemently would &s;he prote&s;t in &s;ecret, that her friend&s;hip for this dear injured crea|ture (who is rai&s;ed much higher in her e&s;teem by &s;uch injurious &s;u&s;picions) &s;hall know no bounds, as &s;he is a&s;&s;u|red it can know no end.</P>
<P>Yet this tru&s;ting confidence, this hone&s;t indi&s;cretion, is, at this early period of life, as amiable as it is natu|ral; and will, if wi&s;ely cultivated, produce, at its proper &s;ea&s;on, fruits in|finitely more valuable, than all the guarded circum&s;pection of premature, and therefore artificial prudence. Men, I believe, are &s;eldom &s;truck with the&s;e &s;udden prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favor of each

They engage more warily, and pa&s;s through the &s;everal &s;tages of acquaintance, intimacy, and confidence, by &s;lower gradations; but women, if they are &s;ometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, enjoy even then an higher degree of &s;atisfaction, than if they never tru&s;ted.
