<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>brave Soldier.&mdash;I have fought a good Fight.</HI>&mdash;All the World knows a Chri&s;tian's Life is a Warfare. From the Moment we name the Name of CHRIST, become His Di&s;ciples, we engage with the Fle&s;h, the World, and the Devil, in a Combat, which is to endure, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, as long as Life

endures.&mdash;Well, Con&s;ider our Apo&s;tle in every Station, in every Period of Life; and who ever fought more valiantly than he, when once enli&s;ted under the great Captain of our Salvation?</P>
<P><HI>In Adver&s;ity</HI> he behaved well, brave as an Hero. What the trying Temptations of Poverty are, <HI>Agur</HI> was well &s;en&s;ible of, when he addre&s;s'd the great JEHOVAH, &s;aying, <HI>Give me not Poverty, le&s;t I &s;teal, and take the Name of my GOD in vain. Prov.</HI> 30. 8, 9. But to &s;uch Poverty was our Apo&s;tle once reduced, notwith&s;tanding his Power of working Miracles for the Relief of others, that he was obliged to follow the Tent-maker's Trade; and thereupon &s;ays to the Elders of <HI>Ephe&s;us, Acts</HI> 20. 34. <HI>The&s;e Hands have mini&s;tred unto my Nece&s;&s;ities, and to them that were with me.</HI>&mdash;But of all Conditions turn to his own Catalogue, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 23,&mdash;27.&mdash;<HI>In Labours more abundant: in Stripes above Mea&s;ure; in Pri&s;ons more frequent; in Deaths oft. Of the Jews five Times received I forty Stripes, &s;ave one: Thrice was I beaten with Rods: Once was I &s;toned: Thrice I &s;uffered Shipwreck: A Night and a Day I have been in the Deep. In Journeyings often, in Perils of Waters, in Perils of Robbers, in Perils by mine own Country-men, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the City, in Perils in the Wil|derne&s;s, in Perils in the Sea, in Perils among fal&s;e Bre|thren: In Wearine&s;s and Painfulne&s;s, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thir&s;t, in Fa&s;tings often, in Cold and Nakedne&s;s.</HI> Amazing! What a Life! And yet do you find the lea&s;t whi&s;per of Murmuring? No, but like a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, he endured Hardne&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd his Soul in Patience. Once, when his Friends, full of Concern, would with Tears have di&s;&s;uaded him going up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where Bonds and Impri&s;onments awaited him, he breaks forth in that Divine Language, <HI>What mean ye to weep, and to break mine Heart?

<P><PB N="9" REF="005877_0006_102736DFD3C2B358">
Again,</P>
<P><HI>In Pro&s;perity</HI> he behaved well, brave as an Hero. 'Tis hard, hard vanqui&s;hing the Temptations of a pro&s;|perous State. Let a Man carefully examine the Religion of CHRIST JESUS, he will &s;oon find, that worldly Pro&s;|perity and true Piety are almo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent, almo&s;t in|compatible: Every outward Ble&s;&s;ing carries a mortal Poi&s;on with it, which u&s;ually infects the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Ex|perience has taught us, that Plea&s;ures ruin Chri&s;tian Moderation, that Riches in&s;pire Men with Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and that Pride is begotten by Grandure and Authority. The Temptations which Pro&s;perity plunges a Man into, are infinitely harder to vanqui&s;h than tho&s;e to which Ad|ver&s;ity expo&s;es us. Many a one that has triumphed over Tyrants and Per&s;ecutors, has &s;unk beneath Pride, Am|bition and Intemperance, when Objects proper to inflame tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions have been &s;et before his Eyes. When a kind GOD fills up our Days with Delights, ah me! how little Pains do we take about &s;ecuring a better Life here|after! 'Tis natural to love the Habitation where we find Sati&s;faction and Charms. When the Dove flies forth from the Ark, and finds the Winds boi&s;terous, the Waves foaming, and the whole Earth buried beneath the Waters, gladly &s;he returns to the Ark, the Place of her Refuge: But when &s;he finds the Heavens &s;erene, the Waters a&s;&s;wag|ed, and the Campaigns flouri&s;hing, there &s;he alights, there &s;he re&s;ts.&mdash;Oh my Soul, here's thy Picture, here's the Image of what thou thy&s;elf art! When the World pro|mi&s;es thee Wealth, Pro&s;perity, Grandure, thou harkne&s;t to the Voice of the Enchantre&s;s, and &s;uffere&s;t thy&s;elf to be &s;urprized by her Charms: But, when thou finde&s;t in the World, Poverty, Di&s;tre&s;s and Mi&s;ery, thou turne&s;t thine Eyes towards Heaven, there to &s;eek for Happine&s;s in its Center.&mdash;Our Apo&s;tle had the Trials of a pro&s;pe|rous Condition, and how divinely well he pa&s;t through it, let his own Words te&s;tify, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 11, 12, 13. <HI>I have learned in what&s;oever State I am, therewith to be content.

<P>Once more,</P>
<P><HI>In Death</HI> he behaved well, brave as an Hero. To know what it is to die, and not be afraid to die, is cer|tainly the mo&s;t exalted Degree of Perfection, which the human Soul is capable of attaining to in this Life: 'Tis the highe&s;t Pitch of Felicity that can be enjoyed in this Vale of Tears.&mdash;To defy Death, to &s;corn it, to brave it out in a dying Hour, without knowing what it is to die, is the very Height of Madne&s;s, 'tis the highe&s;t Pitch of Mi&s;ery.&mdash;The Pagan World afforded <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> who were under no Dread of Death; but then they did not know what it was to die: They viewed Death in a fal&s;e Light: They imagin'd that at Death Men were either reduced to nothing, or appeared before a chimeri|cal Tribunal, or enter'd upon an imaginary Happine&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Commanders of Armies</HI> in the Days of Heatheni&s;m, have been &s;een to brave Death, and defy all its Terrors: But they knew not what it was to die: They look'd upon Death crowned with Laurels, illu&s;trious in Trophies, and renowned in future Hi&s;tory.&mdash;Even <HI>Libertines and De|bauchees</HI> have been &s;een to make light of Death: But they knew not what it was to die: Their Tranquility in the la&s;t Moments of Life aro&s;e from Ignorance; and their Stoutne&s;s was the Effect of Stupidity.&mdash;But the Man who views Death in its true Form, and is under no Dread of Death, but meets it with a calm Soul, that Man has mo&s;t &s;urely arrived to the utmo&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing that Mortals are capable of enjoying upon this Earth: And this Ble&s;&s;ing our Apo&s;tle had arriv'd to. If the Words of
<PB N="11" REF="005877_0008_102736E597982558">
our Text are not a &s;ufficient Proof of this, only turn to the Eighth Chapter of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and 34, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where he makes u&s;e of that inimitable Language, <HI>Who &s;hall &s;eperate us from the Love of</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Shall Tribulation, or Di&s;tre&s;s, or Per&s;ecution, or Famine, or Nakedne&s;s, or Sword? Nay, in all the&s;e Things we are more than Conquerors, through Him that loved us. For I am per&s;uaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things pre&s;ent, nor Things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Creature &s;hall be able to &s;eperate us from the Love of GOD, which is in</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>our Lord.</HI> Ah! how difficult a Thing is it to &s;tand out again&s;t violent Pains! Amid&s;t grinding Tortures the Soul lo&s;es Sight of it&s;elf: Entirely filled with the Violence of its Agonies, it cannot ordinarily bear Reflection: And in the near Approaches of Death, how often do thick Clouds intercept the Beams of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s! But, all the&s;e does the Apo&s;tle brave: United to the SON OF GOD in indi&s;pen&s;able Bands of Love, he defies them. Thus the Chri&s;tian Religion, all manly and &s;ublime, forms its Votaries to true Heroi&s;m. The wi&s;e Man, and the brave Hero, whom <HI>Socrates, Plato,</HI> and <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;aw only in Idea, the Chri&s;tian Religion &s;ees in Practice and Reality: That brings to pa&s;s what neither Philo&s;ophers, by their fal&s;e Maxims, nor the Bravadoes of the Age, by their affected Courage, nor the Libertine, by his Ignorance and Ob&s;tinacy, could ever bring to pa&s;s: That brings to pa&s;s what the whole Univer&s;e could not; and while it in&s;tructs the Chri&s;tian what it is to die, it rai&s;es him above the Fears of Death, and cau&s;es him to &s;ing amid&s;t the Horrors of Di&s;&s;olution, <HI>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? Thanks be unto GOD, who gives us the Victory through our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;Who then would not &s;tudy this Divine Religion? Who would not de|lightfully meditate therein Day and Night? Who would not a&s;&s;ent to its heavenly Truths? And, who would not practice its noble Precepts, when the I&s;&s;ue of all is, an

undaunted Encounter with the King of Terrors, and a final Conque&s;t of the la&s;t Enemy of Mankind? May each one of us be found in the happy Number.</P>
<P>We go on and &s;ay,</P>
<P>II. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was <HI>a fine Racer.&mdash;I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Often do we meet with Allu&s;ions to ancient Heathen Cu&s;toms, in the Writings of our Apo&s;tle, who was certainly an excellent Scholar, as well as a great Divine. We are taught even from early Youth, in our Schools, that Running was one of tho&s;e Exerci&s;es which were much in Vogue at the <HI>Olympic Games</HI> among the <HI>Grecians:</HI> The&s;e Games pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Grece</HI> over into <HI>Italy,</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> People were &s;o fond of them, that one of their Hi&s;torians &s;ays, <HI>Two Things will &s;atisfy the</HI> Romans, <HI>namely, Bread and Public Shows.</HI>&mdash;Among the&s;e various Plays, that of <HI>Running</HI> was very remarkable: The Place where they u&s;ed to run was laid out with the utmo&s;t Accuracy: There were Lines &s;tretched along, and if a Racer &s;tept over them he was judged to have run uncer|tainly, and in vain: Nay, it was even dangerous to &s;tep a&s;ide; for at <HI>Rome</HI> the <HI>Tiber</HI> was the Line upon one Side, and a deep Ditch with pointed Swords upon the other, &s;o that if a Per&s;on &s;tept a&s;ide, he was in Danger, either to be drowned, or pierced to Death.&mdash;This is the Emblem the Apo&s;tle refers to in the Text. Chri&s;tianity is a Race, a lengthy Race. Oh the va&s;t Di&s;tance there is between Virtue, &s;uch as it is in its fir&s;t Beginnings, and that &s;ame Virtue con&s;idered in all the Perfection, to which it might be rai&s;ed upon Earth! Had we arrived at as high a Degree of Holine&s;s, as any meer Man on Earth ever did, yet how far &s;hould we have &s;till to run, e'er we had arri|ved at the highe&s;t Perfection po&s;&s;ible!&mdash;In this lengthy Road it was that our Apo&s;tle ran, that &s;o he might obtain an incorruptible Crown. The Time once was when the Apo&s;tle looked upon him&s;elf as having a great Way to run in the Chri&s;tian Race; &s;ays he, in <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 12. <HI>&amp;c.
<PB N="13" REF="005877_0010_102736ED5C3D7248">
Not as though I had already attained,</HI> reached the Mark, the Goal; <HI>either were already Perfect:</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI> Word here u&s;ed was peculiarly con&s;ecrated to tho&s;e Racers, who came off Victorious at the <HI>Olympic Games.</HI> The Apo&s;tle then would let us know, that he looked upon him&s;elf at a great Di&s;tance as yet from that happy State, when like a con&s;ummate Racer in the Art of Running, he &s;hould &s;ee him&s;elf crowned with the Prize de&s;tin'd to the Con|queror; but adds he, <HI>I follow after,</HI> I pur&s;ue with Ardour and Earne&s;tne&s;s, <HI>if &s;o be I may apprehend,</HI> I may &s;eize upon the Crown e'er long; for which Rea&s;on al&s;o <HI>I have been apprehended,</HI> &s;uddenly &s;eized upon, <HI>by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in a quick miraculous Conver&s;ion to him.&mdash;He goes on, <HI>Brethren, I count not my&s;elf to have apprehended,</HI> I am per&s;uaded I have not as yet reached the Mark: So an humble Soul, ever pondering upon its own Faults, Im|perfections and Failures, does not di&s;cover tho&s;e Virtues in it&s;elf, which &s;hine with a &s;uperiour Lu&s;tre in the View of others!&mdash;<HI>But,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>This one Thing I do, forgetting tho&s;e Things which are behind me, and reaching forth to tho&s;e Things which are before me, I pre&s;s towards the Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling,</HI> the heavenly Calling, <HI>of GOD in</HI> CHRIST JESUS. No Difficulties in the Road, neither the Length of the Race he had to run, could di&s;courage him: On the contrary he ha&s;tned away the fa&s;ter, and would not lo&s;e a Moment's Time: Like a true Racer, he left Places and Things far behind him, and got forward &s;o &s;wiftly that he in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t Sight of them. He made &s;uch Progre&s;s towards Heaven, that he every Day left behind him the Follies and Vanities of the World, and more and more lo&s;t the View of them: He fixed his Eye upon the Reward before him, and was en|couraged in the Way of Virtue from the Pro&s;pect of that Happine&s;s which GOD, through CHRIST, will be&s;tow upon all his per&s;evering Saints. The Reward of being crowned as a Conqueror, not with an <HI>Olive-Leaf,</HI> which at <HI>Olympia</HI> was valued above Gold or Rubies, as it pro|cured the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect all his Days; but
<PB N="14" REF="005877_0011_102736F036078718">
crowned with the Love and Applau&s;e of his Creator, and the immortal Honours of the Heavenly Kingdom, thro'|out Eternity.&mdash;And now in the la&s;t Moments of Life, he breaks forth with Ex&s;ta&s;y of Soul and &s;ays, <HI>I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e,</HI> my Race is run, I have reached the Goal. The Maxim I ever went upon was, to account nothing done, while there remained any thing to be done; nothing accompli&s;hed, 'till all was accompli&s;hed.&mdash;Happy, Happy we, my Brethren, if animated by his Example, and like him, relying upon JESUS our Fore|runner for Strength, we &s;o run as to obtain; make &s;uch Progre&s;s in the Ways of Religion, as that like him we may be able to &s;ay at Death, <HI>I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e.</HI>&mdash;We have begun well: Let us not be affrighted in this Matter of Progre&s;s in Virtue. The Degree of Holine&s;s we have arrived to has co&s;t us much Struggle, Difficulty and Pain; but be not di&s;couraged, the more tedious Part is over; 'tis the ea&s;ier remains: The Way to Heaven is narrow, but it becomes large and &s;pacious to him that continues running therein; e&s;pecially when we eye the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of CHRIST, as our &s;upreme Recompence at the End of our Race: This Thought, that every Step we take, brings us nearer to the Enjoyment of CHRIST, the infinite and the eternal Good, may well animate us to make &s;wift Progre&s;s in our Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e.</P>

A flighty Temptation over&s;ets us; but nothing ever &s;hook him: From the Moment he bowed the Knee to the SON OF GOD, whom with his bodily Eyes he beheld &s;eated at the right Hand of the Maje&s;ty in the Heavens, clothed with Glory in&s;uf|ferable to mortal View, from that Moment he abode &s;tedfa&s;t in his Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion; nor could all the Wiles of Earth or Hell turn him a&s;ide: No wonder, for GOD loved him, and he him&s;elf was careful to depart from all

Nothing more fickle than the Friend&s;hip of Mortals; it is like a Fire of Chaff, ea&s;ily kindled, but which goes out u&s;ually of it&s;elf: 'Tis like a Flood, which at fir&s;t runs with va&s;t Impetuo&s;ity and Noi&s;e, but which anon dries away, &s;o that the Places which it mo&s;t overflowed &s;how no Marks of it: 'Tis like the Lightning &s;hut up in the Bo&s;om of a Cloud, but &s;oon lo&s;t in the open Air. The Love of GOD is of a quite contrary Nature; never does that alter, never does that dimini&s;h, never does that grow cold: Nothing can cau&s;e a Change of his Love:&mdash;Not his Intere&s;ts, for he does not love us for his own Advantage, but for our's: Our Goodne&s;s a&s;cends not to Him, but his Goodne&s;s de&s;|cends abundantly upon us.&mdash;Not for any Defect in our Per&s;ons, or any Change of good Qualities, for He loves us with a Love of Fore-knowledge, which preceeded all Fore&s;ight of Good in us. As the Fore&s;ight of our Imperfections and our Vices did not hinder his Love in Eternity, &s;o the Sight of our Failures in Time does not interrupt it. It is a Love which is founded upon GOD alone. He loves us becau&s;e He has willed to love us: The Rea&s;on hereof is only in Him&s;elf, and the Motive in his own Will: And, &s;ince GOD is ever the &s;ame, and

his Will ab&s;olutely unchangeable, it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that his Love mu&s;t be unchangeable. Well then may true Believers be compared to the Mountains, which remain firm upon their ancient Foundation, while the mo&s;t &s;tately Buildings, and the mo&s;t magnificent Palaces of Emperors fall to ruin.&mdash;But further,&mdash;</P>
<P>A &s;econd Seal upon the true Believer, is, <HI>He departs from Iniquity:</HI> No marvel then that he is &s;tedfa&s;t in his Faith and Profe&s;&s;ion; for, certainly the Rea&s;on why the De&s;erters of the Go&s;pel do not per&s;evere in the Communion of CHRIST, but abandon his Doctrine, is really this, that they are Workers of Iniquity, vicious Per&s;ons, who&s;e Heart is good for nothing. Read Volumes of Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Hi&s;tory, con&s;ult all the Annals of Chri&s;tianity, and you will ever &s;ee, that Apo&s;tates unto Infidelity, were Per&s;ons who led a vicious Life. As the fir&s;t De&s;ertion from Chri&s;tianity began with a <HI>Judas,</HI> who was a notable Thief, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Devil of Covetou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o the follow|ing Ages &s;aw Chri&s;tianity for&s;aken by Men of the &s;ame Stamp; &s;uch as breathed after Vanity and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s. Will that Man, think you, be careful to obtain Salvation in the Way of a true Faith, that does not fear Damnation in the Way of Sin? 'Tis an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age from a de|bauched Heart to a debauched Mind; and Corruption of Manners is the high Road to Corruption of Faith.&mdash;But how &s;tood the Ca&s;e with our Apo&s;tle? His Appeal to <HI>Felix,</HI> before a large Clan of mo&s;t virulent Per&s;ecutors, te&s;tifies for him&s;elf, <HI>Herein,</HI> &s;ays he to that Governor of his Nation, <HI>Herein do I exerci&s;e my&s;elf, to have always a Con&s;cience void of Offence towards GOD and Men.</HI> And as he lived at a Di&s;tance from Sin, whether &s;ecret or open, nothing a&s;toni&s;hed him, nothing overturned him, nothing could root Religion out of his Heart, or &s;tifle it in his Mouth:&mdash;Neither Threats nor Dangers could terrify him, becau&s;e he feared GOD more than Men, and dread|ed the Torments of Eternity more than the Sufferings of Time:&mdash;Neither Promi&s;es nor Advantages could dazzle him, becau&s;e he e&s;teemed the Reproach of CHRIST,

greater Riches than all the Trea&s;ures of the Earth, and the Glory of Heaven rejoyced him more than all worldly Pro&s;perity. In a Word, neither Pa&s;&s;ions nor Vices could corrupt him, becau&s;e he kept under his Body, and bro't it into Subjection, and was daily crucifyng the Fle&s;h, with its Affections and Lu&s;ts.&mdash;Verily, my Hearers, would you be firm and &s;olid Stones in the Building of the Church; would you never fall away from your Faith and Profe&s;&s;ion, after having ta&s;ted the good Word of GOD; would you per&s;evere invariably in the Communion of JESUS CHRIST, here's the infallible Secret, here's the &s;ure Way to &s;ucceed, <HI>Depart from all Iniquity;</HI> Here's all the Pre&s;ervations of the World in one, here's all the Coun&s;els, here's all the In&s;tructions; yea, here's all the Books that can be de&s;ired on &s;o important a Point: Here they are all in one Word, <HI>Depart from Iniquity.</HI> For, If once you are really reformed in your Manners, if once you bani&s;h the Sentiments and Habits of Sin, &s;urely you &s;hall abide firm in the Communion of your Saviour, the Love of CHRIST &s;hall render you ab&s;olutely in&s;eparable from it: The ineffable Trea&s;ure of Piety in your Heart, &s;hall cau&s;e you to de&s;pi&s;e every Thing in Compari&s;on of your Dear Redeemer; the &s;ure Hope of Heaven &s;hall make you intrepid; the Peace you &s;hall feel in your Con&s;cience, you &s;hall prefer above all the Plea&s;ures of the Univer&s;e, and upon the immoveable Ba&s;is of a good Life, nothing &s;hall overturn you; but in the near Pro&s;pect of Death you &s;hall be able to &s;ay, with our Apo&s;tle, <HI>I have kept the Faith.</HI></P>
