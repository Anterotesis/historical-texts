<P>MADAM WILLIS's <HI>LETTERS,</HI> and her <HI>CHARACTER.</HI> WITH SOME STRICTURES OF Madam ANN STOCKBRIDGE'S: AND THE CHARACTER OF Madam <HI>Sarah Page.</HI></P>
<L>THREE ladies in two di&s;tant counties born,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two of them were born in the county of Plymouth; the other in the county of E&s;&s;ex&mdash;(the maiden name of this lady was Carlton). This is noticed that they may have the honour of giving birth to the&s;e ladies, who were an honour to their &s;ex; and that the ladies of the pre&s;ent age <HI>there,</HI> may labour to &s;hine with equal lu&s;tre. May the ladies in other counties, by the&s;e examples be fired with a laudable ambition to excel. The males of any ta&s;te wi&s;h to &s;ee it: then would they lead them to their bowers with as much plea&s;ure as Adam did their mother Eve&mdash;and would think that A&s;trae with all her train, were returned to this earth. Then would the mountains and the little hills rejoice, while the flowers over&s;pread the lawns; and the little rivulets, as they ran from the Manadnocks, and every high hill, into the valleys, would murmur their prai&s;e: for their minds would be adorned with all the flowers which grow upon the banks of the Parna&s;&s;ian &s;treams. How would they &s;hine!&mdash;Will not the ladies of the pre&s;ent ages that are rich in this worlds be rich in good works? Yes, they will: they will improve their own minds&mdash; and will &s;catter books among the poor of their &s;ex, that they may do the &s;ame, if they have minds capable of giving entertainment to a noble ambition; an ambition to de&s;ire that their names may &s;urvive the wa&s;tes of time, and that they may &s;et an example to the generations that &s;hall come after thems to go and do likewi&s;e, that the &s;tory of the nymphs may be no longer fabulous.</NOTE></L>
<L>Who&s;e lives, their age and country did adorn:</L>

<HEAD><HI>Rachel</HI>'s Sepulchre; OR, A MEMORIAL OF Mrs. <HI>Lydia Willis,</HI> Taken, chiefly, from her Letters to Friends, on various occa&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>A DESIRE to pre&s;erve the memory of worthy and beloved Friends, e&s;pecially of &s;uch as have, thro' the cour&s;e of their lives approved them&s;elves the friends of God, is not only founded in nature, but &s;eems evidently warranted in the holy Scriptures. God has told us that <HI>the righteous &s;hall be in everla&s;ting remem|brance</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alms 112 6.</NOTE>; and that <HI>the memory of the ju&s;t is ble&s;&s;ed</HI> <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Prov. 10 7.</NOTE>&mdash; Which implies the care of Providence, not by <HI>miracle,</HI> but by the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of <HI>proper means,</HI> in pre&s;erving the memory of &s;uch <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>righteous</HI> per&s;ons: While tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite character, thro' neglect, are forgotten. Their very name is blotted out; as it follows, <HI>but the name of the wicked &s;hall rot.</HI></P>
<P>From this principle, no doubt, and with this view even to perpetuate the memory of his beloved <HI>Rachel</HI> the <HI>Patriarch Jacob</HI> rai&s;ed a monument over her grave Gen. 35, 19, 20, <HI>Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath; and Jacob &s;et a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day:</HI> which was known, in after ages, to be <HI>Rachel's</HI> &s;epulchre, and re|ferred to, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10, 2.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021608_0004_0FB4113384A8E2E8">But there are other monuments equally durable and more in&s;tructive, due to the merits of some departed friends, which may be ju&s;tly expected, as they are earne&s;tly de&s;ired by the living; for this worthy end, that God may be glorified and prai&s;ed, for his gifts and graces, be&s;towed on the children of men, whereby he alone makes <HI>one</HI> to differ from <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>monuments</HI> here intended, are the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of per&s;ons who&s;e excellent &s;pirit, chri&s;tian conver&s;ation, profitable writings and good works, do furni&s;h materials both to entertain and edify &s;ucceeding generations, who, without &s;uch memorials, would entirely mi&s;s the benefit.</P>
<P>Tis with this view, and not without &s;ome hopes of attaining this end that I have, at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of <HI>one</HI> (whom I could not deny) been per&s;uaded to gather up &s;ome pious remains of <HI>Mrs. Lydia Willis,</HI> who&s;e memory is precious, &s;o far as I have known, to all her acquaintance&mdash;peculiarly &s;o to her beloved &s;urviving hu&s;band, near relations and intimate friends, for who&s;e u&s;e, more e&s;pecially the&s;e pages are de&s;igned.</P>
<P><HI>Characters,</HI> I know, are oftentimes offen&s;ive; and many unkind reflections, are occa&s;ioned thereby, both on the living and the dead.&mdash;But why &s;hould any be offended at a <HI>character truly drawn</HI>? Why take offence, at a &s;imple narrative of <HI>facts,</HI> or a true and faithful account of tho&s;e virtues and good things, which evi|dently took place and appeared, in the per&s;on's life! And this I take to be the main point, in giving a <HI>character,</HI> even to pay a &s;acred regard to <HI>truth</HI> in relat|ing <HI>facts,</HI> or things that were really found, in the <HI>per&s;on</HI> de&s;cribed. And when all is &s;aid <HI>in truth,</HI> we mean not, thereby, to exalt and prai&s;e the <HI>man him&s;elf,</HI> but <HI>to glorify God in him.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, to excite the living to prai&s;e the giver of
<PB N="6" REF="021608_0005_0FB411350592F0E0">
every good and perfect gift, as well as to comfort and edify her &s;urviving friends, I &s;hall in &s;implicity of heart, give a &s;ketch of <HI>Mrs. Willis</HI>'s Life and Character; more e&s;pecially as it appears in her <HI>familiar letters,</HI> wherein the genuine breathings of her &s;oul are the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly di&s;covered, perhaps, of any way in which her ideas were communicated.</P>
<P>Of <HI>the&s;e</HI> I have therefore &s;elected a number, and giving the mo&s;t of them at large, exactly as they were written with her own hand; except a grammatical defect hath, now and then, been &s;upplyed. That her letters might appear in their native &s;implicity, I have not &s;o much as corrected &s;ome <HI>inaccuracies,</HI> which a learned pen might have avoided.&mdash;The principal liberty that I have taken, is &s;ometimes to <HI>exchange</HI> a <HI>word</HI> for <HI>&s;ome other,</HI> which is more expre&s;&s;ive of what was evi|dently her meaning! and the <HI>word</HI> that is <HI>&s;ub&s;tituted,</HI> may be known by inverted comma's before and after it, thus "&mdash;"</P>
<P>But &s;ome of her letters are wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and in tho&s;e that appear, &s;ome &s;tricking pa&s;&s;ages are omitted, on account of the &s;ingular <HI>amity</HI> and <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between <HI>her</HI> and the <HI>living relative,</HI> to whom they were written; in who&s;e hands &s;he knew her&s;elf to be &s;afe, tho' &s;he wrote with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved freedom.</P>
<P>MRS. <HI>Lydia Willis,</HI> late virtuous Con&s;ort of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eliakim Willis,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the &s;econd Church of <HI>Malden,</HI> after ten days &s;ickne&s;s, died there, much lamented, on the 25th of <HI>January,</HI> 1767, in the 59th year of her age.</P>
<P>She was born at <HI>Duxborough,</HI> April 1709, the only Daughter of Mr. <HI>Thomas Fi&s;h</HI> of that Town, decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>A De&s;cription of her per&s;on, (with &s;ome principal branches of her character) is aptly and truly drawn, by another hand, as entered at the clo&s;e of this account.</P>
<P>And yet, to compleat the view of her per&s;on, there is
<PB N="7" REF="021608_0006_0FB4113685C3A988">
room to add, that &s;he was of an eligible <HI>&s;tature</HI> and <HI>proportion.</HI> Her <HI>vi&s;age</HI> comely e&s;pecially in youth, nor wholly defac'd in age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It might have been &s;aid, &s;he was &s;o in age to an uncommon degree.</NOTE>&mdash;On her <HI>countenance</HI> dwelt a peculiar <HI>&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ancy,</HI> &s;o agreeably compo&s;|ed, as to demand re&s;pect, while it &s;en&s;ibly invited to nearne&s;s and freedom of conver&s;e.</P>
<P>As a grateful acknowledgement to the father of lights, it may be &s;aid, that under the influence of a careful and religious education, her youth was pre&s;erv|ed from <HI>blemi&s;h.</HI> So that &s;he entered the &s;ocial life, in good repute among her companions.</P>
<P>An early ta&s;te for <HI>reading</HI> led her to acquaint her|&s;elf, as opportunity favoured, with <HI>authors,</HI> polite as well as religious; the <HI>latter</HI> more e&s;pecially, &s;uited her attention.&mdash;This rendered her conver&s;ation edifying, while it agreeably entertained her di&s;cerning acquaint|ance. So that &s;he was favoured with the be&s;t &s;ociety that her rural &s;ituation and the times afforded.</P>
<P>A good talent at <HI>writing</HI> gave her the advantage of a profitable corre&s;pondence; which many &s;pecial provi|dences occa&s;ioned her frequently to improve.&mdash;Her con&s;titution (being of the mo&s;t delicate &amp; tender make) &s;ubjected her to habitual weakne&s;s, and frequent di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing &s;ickne&s;&s;es; which, together with numerous other adver&s;e providences, made her indeed a woman of &s;orrow and acquainted with grief.&mdash;She was a per&s;on of uncommon trials and afflictions, from her early days. Which, however, did not &s;ink her &s;pirits, but rather tended, for the mo&s;t part, to wake up and invigorate every faculty, and manife&s;t to others, rather than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She abounded in love and tender affections, not only to her near relations, but to all mankind&mdash;A mind, &s;u&s;ceptable of the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, di&s;po&s;s'd her to joy and &s;orrow, in their turns, proportionable to every intere&s;ting event.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="021608_0007_0FB411380525EEA0">On &s;uch occa&s;ions, her letters are mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of what &s;he felt.&mdash;But as cro&s;&s;es and afflictions were fami|liar to her, even from her youth. The&s;e were, mo&s;t frequently, the moving &s;ubjects, on which &s;he wrote.&mdash; In a very low &s;tate of health, and under &s;ome peculiar trials, &s;he writes, to her brother at Stonington, upon his <HI>marriage,</HI> and &s;ettlement there.</P>

<P>Her &s;natched from our &s;ight, we fondly would recall.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT three o'clock this morning, departed this life, af|ter a &s;hort illne&s;s of the bilious kind, Madam <HI>Sa|rah Page,</HI> in the <HI>62</HI>d year of her age&mdash;the amiable relict of the late worthy Capt. <HI>Caleb Page,</HI> of this place.</P>
<P>This lady had weighed about three hundred weight.&mdash; Her &s;tature was eligible&mdash;her vi&s;age comely. There was a beautiful &s;ymmetry in the features of her face; and her &s;hape was neatly proportioned. Such was the maje&s;ty and natural elegance of her appearance, that the eye that &s;aw her gave witne&s;s to her. <HI>Her eyes beamed &s;uch a lu&s;tre,</HI> as be&s;pake the greatne&s;s of her mind: her outward form was lovely, her inward not le&s;s exact. The God of na|ture had ble&s;&s;ed her with a capacious mind, which &s;he greatly improved by reading (or having read to her by her friends, while &s;he laid her hand to the &s;pindle, and her hand held the di&s;taff) &s;ome of the be&s;t writers in po|lemical and practical divinity; for which &s;he had a ta&s;te, as well as for the belles-letters, and would make the mo&s;t judicious remarks upon the beauties of the author. She was religious without the lea&s;t tincture of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> or <HI>&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> and never thought religion con&s;i&s;ted in <HI>grim|mace.</HI> Her invention was &s;prightly, her wit ready, and of the keene&s;t and mo&s;t brilliant kind&mdash;her temper firm and agreeable&mdash;her judgment &s;ound beyond what was common to her &s;ex. She had a mind formed for friend&s;hip, and was capable of giving coun&s;el and advice. She de&s;pi&s;ed all low cunning, <HI>in which &s;ome little creatures pride them&s;elves.</HI> She never &s;aid one thing, when &s;he meant another, which rendered her a mo&s;t endearing friend; <HI>and would never for&s;ake her friend in the day of adver|&s;ity;</HI>

and nothing but the ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude could wean her affections, where &s;he had once placed them, though &s;ome bea&s;ts in human &s;hape may be &s;o ba&s;e &s;ometimes as to give occa&s;ion for it, e&s;pecially if they are of the crocodile kind. Such creatures are aptly de&s;cribed in the follow|ing lines:
<Q><L>Such brutes &s;hall with di&s;grace be cloath'd,</L>
<L>In &s;pite of all their pride:</L>
<L>Their own confu&s;ion like a cloak,</L>
<L>The guilty wretches hide.</L></Q></P>
<P>Her liberality if not boundle&s;s, was mo&s;t exten&s;ive. The poor and needy were her care, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of every kind. Of this, &s;he has left a witne&s;s in the brea&s;ts of hundreds if not thou&s;ands. She was peculiarly fitted for the &s;ocial life. <HI>Her hu&s;band was known in the gates, when he &s;at among the elders of the land; and his heart ever tru&s;ted &s;afely in her.</HI> And though her children could not ri&s;e up and call her ble&s;&s;ed (as &s;he never had any); yet, num|bers whom &s;he trained up, if they have any minds, will do it (and if any <HI>one</HI> was without a mind, &s;he was not to blame for that); for &s;he opened her mouth with wi&s;dom, and in her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> was the law of kindne&s;s. She look|ed well to the ways of her hou&s;hold, and eat not the bread of idlene&s;s.&mdash;How entertaining! how in&s;tructive! was her conver&s;ation! How plea&s;ing! how &s;triking was her &s;mile! She was formed for the &s;weets of life: Her mind was fini&s;hed for delight! Many daughters have done virtuou&s;ly; but her price was far above rubies.</P>
<P>But though &s;he has left her friends in tears, and &s;ome to &s;igh the inward pain in &s;ilence, I tru&s;t &s;he is gone to a more exalted hemi&s;phere, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> even the world that knew her to lament their lo&s;t, as every one that has true di&s;cernment will, and will labour to follow her to that glorious world, of which at pre&s;ent we are not capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> adequate ideas; for eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> enter into the heart of mortals to

conceive of tho&s;e glories which are laid up for &s;uch angelic forms. If they &s;hone here, what will they do hereafter.
<Q><L>Ah! where's that lovely form, who&s;e brighte&s;t eyes</L>
<L>Look'd like the morn, and &s;hone like as the &s;kies;</L>
<L>Fair as the moon, reflecting &s;ilver light,</L>
<L>Strong as the golden &s;un, and beamy bright.</L>
<L>Wrapt in the image of a plea&s;ing &s;leep,</L>
<L>No more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> hear her &s;igh, nor &s;ee her weep.</L>
<L>She &s;hone like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;traea, while here below;</L>
<L>And now, in realms above, &s;he's like her too.</L>
<L>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;weets which feed the thyme bee,</L>
<L>Madam, thou lovely Page, were found in thee.</L>
<L>The beauties of thy &s;ex were found in one:</L>
<L>Thou wa&s;t a magazine of charms alone.</L>
<L>That lovely form is mouldering in the grave,</L>
<L>Where lies alike, the Prince&s;s and the &s;lave.</L>
<L>Dead, no&mdash;&s;he's gone her virtues to di&s;play,</L>
<L>In the bright regions of eternal day.</L>
<L>There "&s;prings of endle&s;s joy are breaking forth!</L>
<L>There buds the promi&s;e of cele&s;tial worth,</L>
<L>Worth which mu&s;t ripen in an happier clime,</L>
<L>And brighter &s;un beyond the bounds of time."</L></Q>
When I &s;ee &s;ome little flirts, how great the contra&s;t! Yet I adore (it is not meant with divine wor&s;hip) a female mind that is great, though it be contained within a little ca&s;ket.</P>
<P>How uncommon &s;oever the above character may appear in any age, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent one, it is not exagge|rated, verbum &s;acerdotis.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> upon the word of a prie&s;t. In drawing this imper+fect character, care was taken to prevent adulation, which ever le&s;&s;ens the credence of real worth. For the truth of the charac|ter, an appeal is made to the &s;en&s;ible part of her acquaintance.&mdash; When this character was once read to a clergyman's lady, &s;he replied with an air, which di&s;covered &s;he thought it exceeded due bounds. The reverend divine, her hu&s;band, told her he knew the woman while &s;he lived, and it was a ju&s;t character: And if &s;o, it mu&s;t have been drawn from the life.
<L>I &s;corn to paint female furies' pa&s;&s;ions,</L>
<L>Which ri&s;e to heav'n, and put out all the &s;tars.</L>
<L>Let me the &s;ofter, more angelick forms</L>
<L>De&s;cribe, in the &s;mooth Watts's &s;ofte&s;t &s;trains.</L>
<L>I wi&s;h the females not void of pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Nor void of &s;en&s;e&mdash;may rea&s;on ever rule.</L></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="021608_0045_0FB41171C4EDEAC8">When I con&s;ider a per&s;on of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed merit ta|ken off the &s;tage before &s;he had arrived at the age allotted for human life, and &s;ee others &s;pared, from who&s;e minds an idea did never &s;hoot, and perhaps never will; I am ready to exclaim, in the language of Portius,
<Q><L>The ways of Heaven are dark and intricate.</L>
<L>Puzzled in mazes, and perplex'd with errors,</L>
<L>Our under&s;tanding traces them in vain,</L>
<L>Lo&s;t and bewilder'd in the fruitle&s;s &s;earch;</L>
<L>Nor &s;ees with how much art the windings run,</L>
<L>Nor where the regular confu&s;ion ends.</L></Q></P>
<P>N. B. Shall not the character of &s;o amiable a per&s;on be &s;pread as far as pen and types can do it, through the American States? Ye brethren of the type, waft her name down to po&s;terity; and by doing of it, you will im|mortalize your own, as &s;ome of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> poets have done by celebrating their godde&s;&s;es. The name of an <HI>Abigail,</HI> a <HI>Judith,</HI> and a <HI>Dorcas,</HI> or a <HI>Tabitha,</HI> with many others, mu&s;t go to make up her character.&mdash;But I &s;hall add no more, le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected, though I fall &s;hort, that I grow wanton in her prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The female reader is de&s;ired, before &s;he gives the pamph|let a &s;econd reading, to impre&s;s her mind with the follow|ing lines, that &s;he may make the characters her own; and then it will be &s;een &s;he did not read in vain:
<Q><L>Let all be hu&s;h'd, each &s;ofte&s;t motion cea&s;e;</L>
<L>Be ev'ry loud tumultuous thought at peace;</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="021608_0046_0FB4117406506CB0">And ev'ry ruder ga&s;p of breath</L>
<L>Be calm, as in the arms of death:</L>
<L>And thou mo&s;t fickle, mo&s;t unea&s;y part,</L>
<L>Thou re&s;tle&s;s wanderer, my heart,</L>
<L>Be &s;till; gently, ah! gently leave,</L>
<L>Thou bu&s;y, idle thing, to leave.</L>
<L>Stir not a pul&s;e; and let my blood,</L>
<L>That turbulent, unruly flood,</L>
<L>Be &s;oftly &s;taid;</L>
<L>Let me be all, but my attention dead.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Editor wi&s;hes his pains may not be lo&s;t; but that the young ladies' minds of the pre&s;ent age, may be &s;o warm|ed by &s;uch bright examples, that they may &s;hine through life like the morning and the evening &s;tar in her cour&s;es. How glorious then will they appear, when the beauties of their minds may be viewed without a tele&s;cope. Then, &s;hould they &s;et in our hemi&s;phere in early life, they will ri&s;e in a brighter, and &s;hine like the famed Narci&s;&s;a who expired in Newhamp&s;hire the la&s;t &s;pring, and left her Philemon and the world to lament their lo&s;s.</P>
