<P>Honourable Brethren!</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> In general my Advice is to you, That in good order &amp; with all Gracefulne&s;s which becomes Wi&s;e Men, you will with Zeal, Courage and faith|fullne&s;s, Stand in the Defence of and Maintain your <HI>Church Libertys</HI>; God certainly obliges you to do it, with all the di&s;cretion and bravery of Spirit, which becomes free-men, in with&s;tanding Va&s;&s;alage or a Servile State, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5 1.13. <HI>Stand fa&s;t there|fore in the</HI> Liberties, <HI>wherewith Chri&s;t was made us free, and be not Intangled again with the Yok of Bondage:</HI> The Plea is as forcible again&s;t a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> as a <HI>Jew|i&s;h Thraldom.</HI> For <HI>Brethren,</HI> ye have been called unto <HI>Liberty.</HI> I mu&s;t acknowledge I have no par|ticular Prejudice again&s;t any of the Governments of Chri&s;tian Prote&s;tant Churches in the World, &s;o as to defraud or di&s;po&s;se&s;s any of them of Heaven; or Monopolize &s;o great a Royalty to our own;
<PB N="12" REF="001660_0011_0FB4D7B9451CF5C0">
But yet I am of this opinion, con&s;idering the ju&s;t Title of the Crown, the Churches, the People, the Capacity of Soil and Climate together, That the Con&s;titution and Way of <HI>New-England</HI> Chur|ches cannot be mended by Exchange.</P>
<P>Briefly to In&s;tance in the Civil part, or Intere&s;t of the Crown, <HI>I</HI> think it is very ea&s;ie to evince, by the Precepts both of Religion and Policy, That the Parliament (that wi&s;e and Augu&s;t Coun|cil of the Nation) could not have invented an E&s;tabli&s;hment in Church Order, more for the &s;ervice of the Imperial Crown of the Briti&s;h Empire than our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, e&s;pe|cially in &s;uch a Country and Climate as this is.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now any ways enter upon the Que&s;tion, but only give ju&s;t a &s;hort hint as to the Revenue. Our Pre&s;ent Con&s;titution does indeed, &s;ome-what more then Sip; It takes an hone&s;t Healthful Draught at Natures Fountains, but leaves the flowing &s;treams for Empire to &s;it at till filled with &s;aciety.</P>
<P>The Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks in &s;ome Kingdoms in <HI>Europe</HI> are ready not only to chide with <HI>Crowned heads,</HI> but to take them by the throat, and wring out of hands, if not almo&s;t a Moity, yet a va&s;t &s;hare of the golden Fleeces that &s;hould &s;upply the Publick Trea&s;uries, and cloath the Nakedne&s;s of the Kingdoms, and the People have no more wit but to Ju&s;tifie and defend them in their Claims and Oppre&s;&s;ions, and that till they them&s;elves (in great Numbers) are as thin and raged as Penury it &s;elf; for by their Rules of adju&s;tment, when the Church hath gotten an Uncon&s;cionable &s;hare, Then the
<PB N="13" REF="001660_0012_0FB4D7BACC370788">
Crown or Subject mu&s;t be almo&s;t &s;tarved; for there is not left a &s;ufficient and plentiful &s;upply for both.</P>
<P>But now our <HI>New-England</HI> Con&s;titution is very fair-mannered; for when it &s;its down to the Staled Ox (made ready) it carves Temperately and (wit-hout much Defacing) Leaves the whole to Empire to make its Armies and Navies, with the re&s;t of its needful and unwearied Ser|vants wellcome. That in Loyalty to your Prince, and for the &s;upport of the Royal Revenue, you may Ju&s;tly pre&s;erve your Freedoms.</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o Con&s;ider the be&s;t Good of a whole People.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, true Grace is the one thing needful, and the main concern for the Improve|ment of the Powers both of Prince, Noble and Pea&s;ant, and tho' Grace be of that nature that it will grow (after a fa&s;hion and in &s;ome &s;ort of &s;oil) almo&s;t under any Government, Yet it is mo&s;t agreeable with Laws of Piety and Wi&s;dom (for the good of all in general (to chu&s;e and &s;ecure that Con&s;titution and form of Government that is mo&s;t a greeable, and which mo&s;t naturally breeds it, and in greate&s;t Plenty.</P>
<P>By the &s;uffrage of our Nation, that Government which &s;en&s;ibly Clogs Tyranny, and Pre&s;erves the Subject free from &s;lavery, under the ambition of men of great Fortune and Tru&s;t, is the only Goverment in the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> to advance mens tempo|ral Happine&s;s; and we in the Country Honour the Re&s;olve in Civil Affairs, and al&s;o affirm (upon great Experience) that &s;uch a Con&s;titution
<PB N="14" REF="001660_0013_0FB4D7BC4918B858">
in Church Government is (al&s;o) the only way to advance Grace and mans Eternal Happine&s;s; and we are the more Ratifyed in our Opinion, for that the experiment has on the other hand been tryed, with a Witne&s;s, in almo&s;t all Kingdoms of the Chri&s;tian World, and the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> by Di&s;&s;ei&s;ing the Fraternity of all Intere&s;t in Church Goverment, only they have had the liberty to be Governed with a Hook in their No&s;e (like wild Cattle in a &s;tring) by the mercy and plea&s;ure of their Drivers; but as for any &s;hare in the Exerci&s;e of Goverment, they have had no more, than the Hor&s;es in the Royal Stables, for that their Spiritual Owners having Sei&s;ed all the Keys of Church Power, they profe&s;s no <HI>Dividend</HI> &s;hall be made, and al&s;o they them&s;elves being Uncontroulable by any, and unaccountable to any, unle&s;s it be to Chri&s;t him|&s;elf, as they pretend; Tho' I believe, thou&s;ands of them never Expect to meet with him, nor think that he ever will audit any Accompts of theirs.</P>
<P>But however, for the comfort and glory of the Pre&s;ent Life, the whole Government of the Spirit|ual Kingdom, in all its Branches, and with its Immen&s;e Profits, has E&s;tabli&s;hed theirs. But this &s;ort of Di&s;cipline, hath &s;unk great part of the Chri&s;tian World, as many times over, as Ages have pa&s;t, &s;ince it hath been Intailed <HI>&V;niver&s;al Rector,</HI> and where it hath kept ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t the Waves and pre&s;ent Currants fit and wa&s;te the&s;e Churches towards tho&s;e Rocks and &s;hip-wracks, whil&s;t we have &s;uch good hands and Pilots on board? God forbid!</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001660_0014_0FB4D7BDC5356B78">Therefore let the&s;e Churches and the noble Fraternity of them, Stand their Ground, Keep fa&s;t hold of what you got, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.11. <HI>hold that fa&s;t which thou ha&s;t, that no man take thy Crown.</HI></P>

<P>WOuld you know what you are, and who you are, in the more ample and Heroick Sence of your &s;tate?</P>
<P>It is certainly very agreeable with Grace, for the upright, &s;ometimes to &s;hift Ideas, and change &s;uch as are mournful; for tho&s;e which bear a bright a&s;pect in their condition, otherways they may rob God of the <HI>Glory</HI> of the be&s;t part of his <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Bounty,</HI> and di&s;-inable their own &s;trength, for &s;ome of the mo&s;t important Service they are called to in the World; therefore <HI>Nehemiah</HI> plucks up his Courage and &s;ays, <HI>Shuld &s;uch a Man as I flee</HI>? as tho' he &s;hould &s;ay, he knew him&s;elf owner of

Cu&s;tom is Ju&s;tly allowed a great Conqueror in the World, it &s;ubdues whole King|doms to its Empire, and all men &s;ubmit and adhere to its Demands and Dictates, as to an Oracle?

<P><HI>I</HI> &s;hall therefore at pre&s;ent only ju&s;t Index the Principal Titles or Heads for An&s;wer, by Pointing briefly at the Duties of Officers, and the preroga|tives of the Churches in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<PB N="26" REF="001660_0025_0FB4D7D084E7F370">
It is now plainly too late for any Officer to pretend Con&s;cince again&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hed Rules: This Object|ion &s;hould have been made before they had taken Office. But now it is out of Sea&s;on, for they were Elected and Ordained to Govern the Church not by their own thoughts, as the Rule, but by the <HI>Churches</HI> Cannon, and that by their own con|&s;ent, when they took Office. And moreover, this is mo&s;t evident, that if &s;uch Powers which belong to the in&s;ide of mens being, <HI>viz.</HI> their Hearts, Phan&s;ies, Notions, Judgments, Imagina|tions or Con&s;ciences, call them by what names you plea&s;e, or let the Owners freely fix the Titles (the odds is not great) Now if the&s;e are to be the Rule of Churches, then Pa&s;tors and Ruling Offi|cers have (in their degree) as ab&s;olute a Dominion over the Churches, as the great <HI>Turke</HI> has over his Ba&s;haws, and other Va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>But I hope, none here will claim this Dominion. And if not, then let Pa&s;tors and Teachers do their Duty in point of Conduct (if the Churches are not Remi&s;s in theirs) and this great vacancy may be &s;oon &s;upplyed, and there is al&s;o a Relief for Officers, if their ju&s;t prerogatives are any ways toucht by the the Traver&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> To Confine the di&s;cour&s;e to this pre&s;ent Example, and to &s;horten terms, for brevities &s;ake, it mu&s;t be granted, that any perticular Officer &s;en&s;ible of his duty, that &s;hall undertake to grati|fie and lead the Church, in the Election and choice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This makes the ca&s;e very ea&s;y in point of Conduct&punc; Yea, tho' other Officers in the &s;ame
<PB N="27" REF="001660_0026_0FB4D7D2EDFC6A48">
Church &s;hould either oppo&s;e or not act. For that any one Officer in a Church, where there may be many of the &s;ame nature, he him&s;elf is vertually the whole Colledge of Officers in any Office-Act that he performs without them. As in civil Affairs, a particular Executor &s;o far &s;u&s;tains the whole Executor&s;hip, as that he can make a vallid Act in that Mini&s;try, though many others are joyned with him in the &s;ame Te&s;tament, &amp; yet don't nor won't Act with him, in this or that affair, tho' confirmed in their Tru&s;t; which Principle is foun|ded in the nature of a joynt Tenancy in general, and in a joynt Tru&s;t in particular, held by many Equals.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> The ca&s;e is very difficult when the &s;tanding Officers joyn as one man, and will not guide the Church in the&s;e Elections referred to, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I fear here has been the great bar to this Office.</P>
<P>We may from Intere&s;t, as well as Duty, Ration|ally &s;uppo&s;e the Inclinations of the Churches, and the de&s;ires of many of them have been made known by repeated &amp; honorable Solicitations, there|in, &s;aying to <HI>Arcipus, Fulfill thy Mini&s;try Co.</HI> 4.17. &amp; we may al&s;o affirm, the Principle is plain, the Office is acknowledged, at home and abroad to be of Divine <HI>Original.</HI> but however this is certain, it is a formal e&s;tabli&s;hment by the&s;e Churches, and not now to be Di&s;puted. Yet the Officers pretend, they &s;ee no Rea&s;on to give way to the Churches De&s;ire or Demands, neither will the conduct in this Ca&s;e, though their Duty does oblige, that &s;o
<PB N="28" REF="001660_0027_0FB4D7D444F68200">
the Church may be compleated in its Officers; No! they are plea&s;ed by Acts of a Superintending Pow|er, to lock the Church Door, and turn this Key again&s;t the Office, and no Pleas or Per&s;wa&s;ions can alter their re&s;olutions. But hereby the Offi|cers do plainly abdicate their Office, by changing the Acts of a limited tru&s;t, bounded by precept into what is meerly Abitrary; &s;o in a Decree, they break up the Relation between them&s;elves and the Church, And by &s;uch an E&s;&s;ential Error &s;o con|trary to the Churches Charter and their own Com|mi&s;&s;ion they forfeit all at once, though Lenity and Mercy may favour them with a long life; Yet in the Eye of Ju&s;tice they are Dead men, if not in nature yet in Law, And upon their <HI>OBSTINACY</HI> may ju&s;tly be <HI>DEGRADED.</HI> Therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e, when it comes to that Extremity, the Churches may and ought to call in Council and <HI>Proceed in their work and Duty for their own Well being,</HI> after the manner of an Inorganick <HI>Church Platform, Chap.</HI> 10 and this I need not &s;tand to di&s;cribe, our Plat-form, The Laws of the Province and the Practice of the Churches in other Ca&s;es, and vacancies will do it.</P>
<P>Then whether the&s;e Congregational Churches thro' the&s;e Provinces may not ju&s;tly reflect Blame upon them&s;elves, for too Supine and negligent a frame of Spirit, towards &s;o Great an Intere&s;t, and &s;o noble an Office, &s;eeing they have &s;uch a &s;hare in Government, and can fairly Re&s;cue them&s;elves and their own Rights, by the Power and Prin|ciples of their own E&s;&s;ence, when their other Officers neglect Duty?</P>

and to be ob&s;erved, that GOD, that &s;ecret Title of the Almighty, with which the Holy Scripture does &s;o abound, is not once named (as I can find) in the whole Treati&s;e; as tho' the mo&s;t &s;acred Titles, as well as Sections of that heavenly Book, would move Fears and irritate Jealou&s;ies, rather then pouer down Solace and Comfort upon this Undertaking.

to their Natures. So that if we bring the&s;e Pro|po&s;als under Examination by the Laws of Rea&s;on, we mu&s;t enquire whether they are agreeable with the nature and Con&s;titution of the Churches, if they fully harmonize with their Principles of E&s;|&s;ence, then they may be enroled for Canons; but if they Jar and are plainly Repugnant, we may then Lawfully cen&s;ure them, and pronounce them Irrational. Whether the&s;e Churches are con&s;ti|tuted by Scripture or Rea&s;on, yea or no, that is not our Que&s;tion, but being of &s;uch a Frame or Con&s;titution, as they now are, and always have been, all who pretend to Support and pre&s;erve them, and yet take &s;uch mea&s;ures, as will utterly overthrow and di&s;&s;olve them, &s;uch Repairers have apparently de&s;erted the Dictates and Government of Right Rea&s;on.</P>

<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>Legi&s;lation</HI>; Our New-England Convocation admits, and the Government does profe&s;s the fraternity as nece&s;&s;ary to the being of all Synodical A&s;&s;emblies, that as far as Legi&s;|lation, &s;piritual, is left to men, and as they have a great Trea&s;ure, <HI>viz.</HI> Their <HI>Salvation</HI> Imbarqued, &s;o they have a great Intere&s;t in the Management of it; and herein they agree with the Engli&s;h Caution and Wi&s;dom, in the Modes of Civil Government of the Empire; for the Commons are one great &s;tate in the Civil Legislation; and as they have a great Power in the mannagement of that Great Tru&s;t.</P>

<P>According to my Apprehen&s;ion, this Propo&s;al In&s;ults very Daringly over the Churches in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. By Ingro&s;ing the Right of Juri&s;diction, not only over the vi&s;ible Freedom and Liberties, but Conjugal and Secret Powers of Chri&s;ts Virgin and Widdow Churches. That it &s;eems to me very Advi&s;eable (if this Propo&s;al may &s;tand for a &s;ound Precept) that forth-with another Office be erected, and put into the hands and under the Government of a few men, exactly skilled in <HI>Phi&s;i|ognomy,</HI> and deeply &s;tudied in the Sympathies and Antipathies of Humane Nature, with an ab&s;olute &s;uperintending Power to Controul and direct all Wooers in their Choice for the Mar|riage Bed; for that there is many a fond Lover who has betrayed the glory of Wedlock, by making an unwi&s;e and unfortunate Choice; And why may not perticular Beds be over-Ruled,
<PB N="90" REF="001660_0089_0FB4DB3C0741A2B0">
as well as perticular Churches? both being for the good and &s;ervice of Mankind, and for that both parties, Husband and Wife, Pa&s;tor and Church, by our &s;ort of Government, are bound for Term of Life, or &s;o long as both &s;hall live. Indeed, were our Con&s;titution in Church-Order under the Superintendency of a Patron, or a Lord Bi&s;hop, who can &s;end (<HI>pro Tempore</HI>) a Curate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then Recall him, and place another in his &s;tead, the Project might be very Advi&s;eable; but &s;eeing the&s;e Churches are &s;ettled Congregational, and by their Princi|ples, the Ordination is, as it were, the Nuptials, or Marriage Day of two Lovers, that nothing but Death, or a Bill of Divorce (for betraying the Glory of their Union) can Part: It is then good and rea&s;onable, that they be left to choo&s;e as they be&s;t affect, and not forcibly be tyed up to a kind of Hob&s;ons Choice, <HI>One of the&s;e, or None.</HI> This apparently puts too hard upon the Churches Liberties, and overthrows the Govern|ment; for that our Platform in <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. treating of the Nature of the Churches, a&s;&s;erts, <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. <HI>That the State of the Vi&s;ible Church &s;ince the Coming of Chri&s;t, is Only Congregational</HI>; Therefore neither National, Provincial nor Cla&s;&s;ical; Then what does this Propo&s;al do here?</P>
<P>Al&s;o, our Plat-form a&s;&s;erts the free electing Power of the Churches, <HI>Chap.</HI> 5. in the&s;e words, Ordinary Church Power is that of Priviledge, &s;uch as belongs to the Brother-hood whereby they de&s;ign per&s;ons unto Office. So al&s;o in <HI>Chap.</HI> 10.
<PB N="91" REF="001660_0090_0FB4DB45479E8FC0">
in the&s;e words, The Power granted by Chri&s;t unto the Body of the Church and Brother-hood is a Prerogative or Priviledge which the Church doth exerci&s;e in the Admi&s;&s;ion of her own Mem|bers, and in chu&s;ing their own, Officers. Now if Chri&s;t has given the&s;e high Powers and Autho|rities to his Churches, he has certainly furni&s;hed them with Skill and Wi&s;dom to Manage them.</P>
<P>So we come to the Second Part of the Affront in this Propo&s;al, and that is,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> By its making a plain Pre&s;umption of Incapacity in the Churches of Doing their own proper work without their Graces help. It is as much as to &s;ay, Alas! Alas! it is well known that the Churches are generally a &s;ort of plain men, little Skilled in deep Matters; That there is apparent Danger, if left in their Elections to their own Conduct of Introducing very Illiterate Per&s;ons and doleful Creatures, to preach in the Temple of God, as Officers there. Now this is much agreeing with the old Arguments, again&s;t the Laity, who were de|&s;cribed by the Learned to be without the Know|ledge of the Original Languages, and other parts of Polite Learning, and &s;o no ways fit to Interpret Scripture, therefore it is very Rationally En|acted, That the BIBLE be taken from them, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;tudy Here&s;ie and not Holine&s;s out of that Divine Book. But to pa&s;s by all &s;uch Pleas, I &s;hall come to the main point in plain Terms, and that is this, Our <HI>Plat-Form</HI> is our Settlement, and it has Secured to the
<PB N="92" REF="001660_0091_0FB4DB48551EB918">
Churches the&s;e Prerogatives, and they are part of their Intailed Inheritance; &amp; it is a vain thing to pretend or plead the Incapacity of Right Owners and Rich Proprietors, e&s;pecially whil&s;t there is a Competent Set of Sences left them. Indeed, when any Gentlemen can &s;hew any Pre|cept, and produce a Commi&s;&s;ion for the taking into their hands the E&s;tate of Ideot-Churches, they may then Cite their Intellectuals to a pro|per Bar, and Verdict going again&s;t any parti|cular Example, they than, <HI>Ip&s;o facto,</HI> become Gaurdians, and may enter into their Wor&s;hip.

<P>But yet before I clo&s;e this Argument, I &s;hall a little further humour the Pre&s;umption of In&s;ufficiency here laid down; and therefore I &s;hall de&s;ire, that a Survey be made of the &s;tate of the Churches, and if their free Election be found for this thirty Years la&s;t pa&s;t (and we will go no higher) have by the Major part of Voices introduced In&s;ufficient Officers, Then let the <HI>Plat-Form</HI> be null'd, and the Propo&s;al &s;tand as a more vallid Cannon.

<P>It is certain, con&s;idering the Nature of the Creature here formed, there had need be &s;ome <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour A&s;&s;igned.

<P>Now, if this be all that is here Propo&s;ed (in my Opinion) the Creators are very Defective in their Propo&s;itions; For tho' the Work Mention|ed is in it &s;elf good Work, <HI>But it's all Done al|ready to their hands, There is nothing of this Na|ture Neglected in</HI> N.

Therefore, care &s;hould be had, that it ben't Squandered away wa&s;te|fully. Our natural Lives, Health and Honour, Families and E&s;tates are all very &s;ignificant and Co&s;tly things, and their Dependence is much on the well husbanding of Time, in&s;omuch that in hard and penurios Climates, the Inhabitants had need be very &s;aving of Time for the &s;up|port of all the&s;e great Intere&s;ts, and &s;eeing there is &s;o much time already &s;et for Religion.
