<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Hi&s;tory would mo&s;t willingly have been excu&s;ed from the &s;ervice, had any other per&s;on appeared to have undertaken it. A work of this kind was wanted: The author, however unequal to the ta&s;k, had advantages herefor above &s;ome others, being born in the we&s;tern part, and having the bounds of his habitation fixed in the ea&s;tern part, of the county. Had the writer of the&s;e &s;heets known before he began, what a labour it would have been, he would not have attempted it, but having begun, he was unwilling to de&s;i&s;t, and has been urged on by the partiality of his friends. However difficult the collection of materials has been, yet he has derived a &s;atisfaction by no means &s;mall, in ran&s;acking records, &s;earching into the antiqui|ties of this part of the country, and in endeavouring to gratify his readers with a hi&s;tory thereof.</P>
<P>The locality of the work may be thought, by &s;ome, an objection to it. But to have compleated a hi&s;tory of the Commonwealth, upon this plan, would be a labour too great, and too lengthy for any one, unle&s;s he was a per&s;on of fortune, and &s;hould devote a long life wholly thereunto. If various gentlemen, in different parts of the State, would undertake to write a hi&s;tory of their particular counties or di&s;tricts, upon this, or a better plan, we might then hope to &s;ee a complete hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts collected, which would be not merely entertaining, but profitable and in&s;tructive from age to age; care being taken to make &s;uch alterations in, and additions to the work, as
<PB N="vi" REF="026481_0005_0FD04FDB8AE903B8">
time would occa&s;ion: The&s;e would re&s;pect the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate of the counties, their population, and their improvements in arts and manufactures.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t care and pains have been taken to a&s;|certain exact dates, where it was po&s;&s;ible. Hence towns and churches may know their re&s;pective ages, if at any time their records &s;hould be unhappily de&s;troyed. The dates, however, are all in&s;erted according to the origin|als; and, therefore, the reader, in order to know when a century or more has elap&s;ed from the date of any event recorded in this hi&s;tory, will always remember to add eleven days thereto, until he comes down to the <HI>2</HI>d of September <HI>1752,</HI> when New Style, &s;o called, took place. For in&s;tance, if a town was incorporated Augu&s;t <HI>1, 1728,</HI> it will not have completed a full century until Augu&s;t <HI>12, 1828.</HI></P>
<P>The author of this work has endeavoured to be im|partial, and to do ju&s;tice to every town in its de&s;cription and hi&s;tory, and if he has failed hereof, it mu&s;t be im|puted to other cau&s;es than any particular local preju|dices. He has not omitted any thing worth pre&s;erving, which has come to his knowledge.</P>
<P>Many and too great defects will, mo&s;t likely, be found by di&s;cerning readers of this hi&s;tory; but none, how|ever, but &s;uch as their candor and ingenuity will readily excu&s;e in this fir&s;t attempt of the kind; and none but what may be remedied in time, if ever a future edition &s;hould be called for. And per&s;ons, who find defects or mi&s;takes, or &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of additions or alterations, are reque&s;ted candidly to point them out to</P>

Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it: For there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of gifts."

<P>It is large in extent; being bounded on the &s;outh, almo&s;t equally, by the States of Connecti|cut and Rhodei&s;land; and on the north by the &s;tate of Newhamp&s;hire.

<P>Worce&s;ter is <HI>part</HI> of a tract of land called by the aboriginals, <HI>Quinfigamond</HI>; which territory was by them e&s;teemed to bound ea&s;terly, partly on Quin&s;igamond pond, and partly on Ha&s;&s;anami&s;co, now Grafton; &s;outherly, on the Nipnet, or Nip|mug country, where Oxford and &s;ome adjacent towns now are; we&s;terly, on Quaboag, now Brook|field, and lands in that vicinity; and northerly, on Na&s;hawogg, now Lanca&s;ter, Sterling, &amp;c. &amp;c. On October 24th, 1668, a town&s;hip of land of rather more than eight miles &s;quare, to be bound|ed, ea&s;terly on Quin&s;igamond pond, was granted by the General Court, to Daniel Gookin, Daniel Henchman, Thomas Prentice, and their a&s;&s;ociates. But war, at that time, and for &s;everal &s;ucceeding years, prevailing with the Indians, the &s;ettlement of the place was prevented until the year 1685: At which time, the natives appearing peaceably di&s;po&s;ed, and behaving in a friendly manner to the Engli&s;h, the above named per&s;ons, together with John Wing, George Dan&s;on, Peter Goulding, Dickery Sargeant, I&s;aac Bull and Jacob Leonard, ventured to begin the plantation.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="026481_0025_0FD056250A9E0480">The town was incorporated the preceding year October 15, 1684, and the name of Worce&s;ter given to it. But the fir&s;t town meeting ever held in the place, was on the la&s;t Wedne&s;day of September, 1722. A &s;pecial order of the General Court pa&s;&s;ed directing Judge Fulham of We&s;ton, to call &s;aid meeting.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, by the way, that the method of the Government was very different in former times, from what it has been &s;ince.&mdash;In tho&s;e earlier days, plantations were named, and &s;aid to be incorporated, when there were few, or no inhabitants in them; and when a &s;ufficient number of people had &s;ettled in them, a &s;pecial re&s;olve of Court pa&s;&s;ed to empower them too meet, and choo&s;e their town Officers: But for 60 years pa&s;t, they have been <HI>incorporated, named,</HI> and empowered to hold town meetings, by the &s;ame act.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year following &s;everal other men, with their families, moved into the place. And the &s;ettlement thereof went on pro&s;perou&s;ly until the year 1701, when the Indians began again to attack the frontier towns in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. In the year 1702, the In|dians killed the wife of Dickery Sargeant, and two of his children, and carried three of his children into captivity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e children, two &s;ons and a daughter, cho&s;e to dwell among the In|dians. However, in 1726, they accompanied Mi&s;s Williams, taken from Deerfield, on a vi&s;it to then friends in Newengland.</NOTE> In this town al&s;o, Mr. Eli&s;ha Ward was &s;uppo&s;ed to be killed, for he was known to be &s;hot at, and never after &s;een, or heard of. The war raged with &s;uch fury at this time, that Worce&s;|ter was entirely depopulated. But peace being concluded with the Indians, in the beginning of the year 1713. Some of the proprietors of the town&s;hip applied to the General Court for encour|agement and direction towards its re&s;ettlement.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="026481_0026_0FD056268A87EC40">In con&s;equence of this application the Court ap|pointed a committee to a&s;certain the claims of the grantees; and conduct the re&s;ettlement of the place. On the 21&s;t of October, 1713, Jonas Rice, with his family, moved into the place and remain|ed there, without any other inhabitants, until the &s;pring of the Year 1715, when a con&s;iderable num|ber of per&s;ons joined him. The number of &s;et|tlers was augmented by Emigrants from Ireland in 1718: Since which time it has flouri&s;hed and in|crea&s;ed exceedingly, and become large, populous and wealthy. In the year 1740, Holden was &s;et off from Worce&s;ter, and became a di&s;tinct town; and in 1778, 2200 acres, with the inhabitants thereon, were taken from this town to aid in forming the town of Ward;&mdash;Yet &s;till Worce&s;ter is large in its dimen&s;ions, being about &s;ix miles &s;quare: And bounded, northerly, on Holden; ea&s;terly on Shrew&s;bury, Boyl&s;ton and Long Pond; &s;outherly, on Ward and Sutton, and we&s;terly, on Leice&s;ter, and Holden. It is become very populous, con|taining two thou&s;and one hundred inhabitants, according to the cen&s;us taken in the year 1791: And it will no doubt, &s;till greatly increa&s;e for many years. It is al&s;o wealthy and opulent, being the third town in the county, in the proportion which it pays in a &s;tate tax; and would be the fir&s;t, mo&s;t certainly, in the li&s;t, did not the other two, Brook|field, and Sutton, greatly exceed it in extent and dimen&s;ions; and al&s;o in the number of &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, in the outer parts of this town, &s;ub&s;i&s;t by hu&s;bandry. But in the centre, in the
<PB N="28" REF="026481_0027_0FD05628090B75D0">
compa&s;s of one mile, and mo&s;tly on one &s;treet, are collected the county officers, a number of merch|ants and &s;hop keepers, profe&s;&s;ional men, and me|chanicks of various &s;orts. A very great trade is here carried on, in European and We&s;tindia goods; and the adjacent country is &s;upplied from this town: Here are large apothecary &s;tores, and &s;tores of all kinds of hardware.</P>
<P>A printing pre&s;s was here &s;et up in 1775, by Mr. I&s;aiah Thomas, who is thought to do far more bu&s;ine&s;s than any other in the &s;tate, or in the Unit|ed States of America.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the time of the political controver&s;y between Great Britain, and the&s;e States, previous to the war, near the clo&s;e of the year 1774, &s;everal gentlemen applied in Bo&s;ton, to I&s;aiah Thomas, printer of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts Spy, (a New&s;paper famed for its oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h govern|ment, and which was no &s;mall &s;poke in the wheel of the American Revo|lution) to &s;et up a printing pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in Worce&s;ter: He con&s;ented, and i&s;&s;ued propo&s;als for that purpo&s;e and for printing a new&s;paper weekly, in the town of Worce&s;ter: But, &s;oon after, the politicks of that time wearing a more &s;erious a&s;pect, and Mr. Thomas being one of a li&s;t of per&s;ons, who it was thought, would fir&s;t feel the weight of Briti&s;h vengence, &s;ecretly with|drew him&s;elf, and his printing materials, from Bo&s;ton. His printing ap|paratus he &s;ent off for Worce&s;ter, about three days before the battle of Lex|ington, and he him&s;elf followed the day after that battle. On the 3d of May, 1775, he, at Worce&s;ter, recommenced the publication of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Spy, which was the fir&s;t printing performed in the county. This new&s;paper is &s;till printed at Worce&s;ter, and is the olde&s;t in the State, the Bo&s;ton Gazette excepted.</P>
<P>When the war cea&s;ed, Mr. Thomas extended his bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the year 1788, ree&s;tabli&s;hed a printing office i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bo&s;ton, he him&s;elf re&s;iding in Worce&s;ter, where he &s;till carries on the printing bu&s;ine&s;s on a very larger &s;cale, as he does al&s;o in Bo&s;ton. Among other large works which have i&s;&s;ued from his pre&s;&s;es in Worce&s;ter, are three editions of the Bible, viz. a large Folio, with 50 copper plates; a large Royal Quarto, with Con|cordance, &amp;c. and one in Octavo;&mdash;they are all the fir&s;t of the kind ever printed in America:&mdash;And, upon examination, his editions are found the mo&s;t correct of any now extant. He is now preparing to print two other editions of the Bible; viz. a &s;mall Quarto; and one in Duodecimo, or the common &s;chool Bible: For this la&s;t, all the types will be kept &s;tanding for the whole work, as is the method in the King's printing hou&s;es in England and Scotland. Mr. Thomas has al&s;o carried on the Bookbinding bu&s;ine&s;s very exten&s;ively; and is now engaged in building, in Worce&s;ter, as large a Paper Mill as is in this &s;tate. His Book&s;tore in Worce&s;ter is kept well filled with a large a&s;&s;ortment of Books in all branches of Literature, which is a great accommodation to purcha&s;ers, in the town and county. His manu|factures employ and &s;upport a large number of people; and it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of no one per&s;on, has added more to the con&s;e|quence and advantage of the town and county of Worce&s;ter, than his.</P></NOTE> The hou&s;es in the &s;treet, are very compact, many of them large and elegant, as al&s;o the &s;tores and &s;hops. And here they have a number of large inns, not only for the accommo|dation of the people of the county, at the times

for holding the courts, but for travellers, and it is a place of great re&s;ort. On the &s;treet has lately been erected a large and hand&s;ome &s;choolhou&s;e, of about 60, by 30 feet, and two &s;tories high. On the lower floor are two apartments, one de&s;igned for a grammar &s;chool, and the other for a writing &s;chool. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pper &s;tory there is one large a|partment, with a fire place at each end: This is u&s;ed by the &s;cholars on their exhibition days. On the top there is a cupola with a bell. The &s;treet is wide, &s;traight, and very plea&s;ant, and adorned on either &s;ide with trees. And upon the whole, this town is one of the mo&s;t populous, lively, flouri&s;h|ing, agreeable inland places in the &s;tate. There are two congregational religious &s;ocieties in this town, called the fir&s;t and &s;econd pari&s;hes. The&s;e have no parochial boundaries, but are called poll pari&s;hes; each inhabitant having a right by law, to pay and to connect him&s;elf to which pari&s;h he plea&s;es, only &s;ignifying his choice, by leaving his

<P>In the year 1719, the fir&s;t meetinghou&s;e was e|rected, and here a church was gathered, and the Rev. Andrew Gardner, the fir&s;t mini&s;ter was or|dained in the autumn of that &s;ame year 1719, but the month and day cannot be a&s;certained. He was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Worce&s;ter on the la&s;t Wedne&s;day of October 1722, and was afterwards &s;ettled at Lunenburgh. Mr. Gardner was &s;ucceeded in the &s;acred office by the Rev. I&s;aac Burr, who was or|dained their &s;econd pa&s;tor, on the 25th of Octo|ber 1725. He, likewi&s;e, after a few years, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his work, viz. on November, 1744.</P>
<P>After his removal the Rev. Thaddeus Maccarty, for a &s;hort &s;pace Mini&s;ter of King&s;ton, in the coun|ty of Plymouth, where he was ordained November 3d, 1742, was in&s;talled pa&s;tor, the third in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, of the church and people of Worce&s;ter, on the 10th of June 1747. He continued in office until his death, which was on July 20, 1784.</P>
<P>After the Rev. Mr. Maccarty's death, a &s;econd church was formed here on December 1&s;t, 1785, and the Rev. Aaron Bancroft was ordained to the pa&s;toral care thereof, February 1, 1786. This &s;econd religious &s;ociety was incorporated, as a di&s;|tinct Pari&s;h November 13, 1787.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="026481_0030_0FD0562C886425C8">To the Rev. Mr. Maccarty &s;ucceeded, as pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t church and &s;ociety in Worce&s;ter, the Rev.

This gentleman had been for a &s;hort &s;pace, mini&s;ter of the fourth con|gregational &s;ociety in Newhaven, in Connecticut.</P>
<P>In Worce&s;ter, a Social Library company has late|ly been e&s;tabli&s;hed; their &s;tock already amounts to 90l. and as the in&s;titution is founded on a large and liberal plan, it will doubtle&s;s be greatly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this town, a number of gentlemen, reque&s;ting the &s;ame, received a charter in April, 1793, from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Grand Lodge for holding a LODGE of FREE MASONS, by the name of the MORNING STAR LODGE, and I&s;aiah Thomas, was unanimou&s;ly elected Ma&s;ter. And on the 11th of June, the Grand Lodge, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, meet|ing at Worce&s;ter for the purpo&s;e, he was in&s;talled by the mo&s;t wor&s;hipful Grand Ma&s;ter, John Cut|ler, and the Lodge con&s;ecrated. The &s;tated meet|ings of the Morning Star Lodge are on the third Tue&s;day of every month.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now pre&s;ent our readers with a geo|graphical de&s;cription of the town of Worce&s;ter.</P>
<P>The town is full of round gradual ri&s;ing hills, and of dales&punc; There are few craggy precipices, and few exten&s;ive plains. The middle, or mo&s;t thick &s;ettled part, is in a valley, &s;urrounded by plea&s;ant hills, and from the hill as we enter the town from the ea&s;t, it makes an agreeable appearance. Tat|nuck and Boggachoag hills are remarkable for hav|ing formerly had Indian towns on them. They
<PB N="32" REF="026481_0031_0FD0562E082163F0">
are neither of them very high. Mill&s;tone hill, a|bout a mile from the courthou&s;e, to the ea&s;t, is the common property of the inhabitants, who procure from thence &s;tones, &s;ome of which they &s;plit out, and hew for underpinning to their hou&s;es, for door &s;tones and &s;teps. The &s;tones are hard grained, and peculiarly fit for Mill&s;tones&punc; It mu&s;t be a &s;ingu|lar advantage to &s;uch a town as Worce&s;ter, to have &s;uch an inexhau&s;tible quarry of building &s;tone, which can be worked into any &s;hape, where there are, and will be &s;o many gentlemen who wi&s;h to build with elegance, as well as for convenience.</P>
<P>The natural growth of wood is oak, walnut and che&s;nut, on the higher lands, &s;ome pine on the &s;mall plains and valleys, and in the &s;wamps and low lands, a&s;h, birch and maple. The town is well &s;upplied with wood. And as every farmer has his own plat of woodland upon his home&s;tead, &s;o the face of the town appears more woody from the hills, than it is in fact. The inter&s;per&s;ion of hills and dales, fields and woods, affords an agreea|ble and variegated pro&s;pect, extending about &s;ix or &s;even miles from the ob&s;erver's eye. And a more enlarged view is not to be had from the great|e&s;t eminence in the town.&mdash;The &s;oil is pretty good, warm, more inclined to &s;and than clay, however it cannot be called &s;andy; is is friendly to the growth of Indian corn. Some of the farmers have lately turned their attention to rai&s;ing wheat and flax, and with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. Rye is rai&s;ed here in great quantities. The ri&s;ing grounds are very good for pa&s;tures and orchards; and the lower not indif|ferent
<PB N="33" REF="026481_0032_0FD0562F88CD5B60">
for hay. Indeed, there is &s;oil of almo&s;t eve|ry kind in Worce&s;ter, and almo&s;t on every farm. It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe its general properties for it is productive, in a degree, of almo&s;t all kinds of country produce, and not noticeable for any par|ticular one.</P>
<P>How far this town affords mines and minerals, has never yet been fully a&s;certained. About the year 1754, a broad flat vein, about a foot thick, of lead and &s;ilver ore, in the proportion of 2&frac12; penny|weights of &s;ilver to one pound of lead, was di&s;cov|ered, running &s;launtwi&s;e down into a rock. Some per&s;ons purcha&s;ed it, and procured a miner, who followed it a little way into a rock, on a hill; and then advi&s;ed to meet it by digging away before it. In this undertaking con&s;iderable money was ex|pended, but they never met the vein. After a while, they left off di&s;couraged. However, in digging to meet this vein, they found &s;everal pieces of ore, a|bout the &s;ize of a peck, or half bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>Worce&s;ter has really but one pond within its limits, this is called <HI>North Pond,</HI> and is of an oval form; covering about 30 acres of ground, and is &s;urrounded partly by woods and partly by a &s;wamp and meadow. Though not an agreeable pond, yet it is well &s;upplied with the u&s;ual &s;orts of common pond fi&s;h, as pickerel, perch, &s;hiners, breams, eels, and pouts. The&s;e fi&s;h, however, are not of the be&s;t quality, as the water is rather &s;lagnant, and the bottom muddy. As to Quin&s;igamond, or Long Pond, or what is &s;ometimes called Worce&s;ter Pond, the facts are the&s;e, that all the water of that pond
<PB N="34" REF="026481_0033_0FD056310B2E9068">
which lies within the line of the town of Worce&s;ter, does not cover more than one acre of land, being two or three &s;mall coves: The re&s;t of the pond lies within the bounds of Shrew&s;bury, and will be particular|ly de&s;cribed when we come to &s;peak of that town.</P>
<P>Worce&s;ter is very well watered by rivers, brooks and rivulets. Bimilick, or Mill brook has its &s;ource in North Pond; and running &s;outherly, it cro&s;&s;es the great road a little north of the Courthou&s;e, and empties into Black&s;tone river. It is not more than ten feet wide and one foot deep; but a fine &s;tream. Turkeybrook, which is about the &s;ame &s;ize, origin|ates in Holden. Tatnuck, or Halfway River, in the &s;outhwe&s;terly part of the town, runs al&s;o from Holden, empties perhaps ten times as much wa|ter, and is about two rods wide. This pa&s;&s;es on through Sutton, to the &s;outhward. Boggachoag river, which runs northwardly, through a corner of Ward, is nearly as large as Halfway River. The&s;e three &s;treams unite in French River, &s;o called.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e &s;treams there are, within the town of Worce&s;ter, a very large paper mill, four grift mills, four &s;aw mills, two fulling mills, and two trip hammers. The fulling mills are the property of Me&s;&s;rs. Stowell, father and &s;ons, by whom the clothier's bu&s;ine&s;s, in all its branches, is carried on to as great perfection as any where in the &s;tate. They dye fine &s;carlet, and deep blue colours, in the be&s;t manner.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above mentioned there are two or three works for the making of Pota&s;h, in which Pearla&s;h is al&s;o made: Al&s;o a di&s;tillery for gin.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="026481_0034_0FD05632896FC198">There is a Po&s;t office in this town; the Po&s;tma&s;|ter is I&s;aiah Thomas.</P>
<P>The great po&s;t road, from Bo&s;ton to Springfield is very good in that part of it which goes through Worce&s;ter. As this is the &s;hire town, roads from all parts of the county, and in every direction, cen|tre here. There is now a Po&s;t road e&s;tabli&s;hed, from Worce&s;ter to Providence, which pa&s;&s;es through Mendon.</P>
<P>Worce&s;ter is &s;ituated 47 miles from Bo&s;ton, a little to the &s;outh of we&s;t.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid what may be thought &s;ufficient, in de&s;cribing the town of Worce&s;ter, we cannot take our leave of it, without mentioning with re&s;pect, the name of Chandler. The town of Worce&s;ter, in particular, and the county of Worce&s;ter at large, were originally greatly indebted to the Hon. John Chandler, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Wood&s;tock, the fir&s;t Judge in the county, and his &s;on, the fir&s;t Col. John Chand|ler of Worce&s;ter, who, in proce&s;s of time &s;ucceed|ed his father in all his offices, titles and honours, for their addre&s;s, activity and enterpri&s;e. And their names ought to be held in grateful remembrance.</P>

<HEAD>LANCASTER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is, by &s;everal years, the elde&s;t town in the county of Worce&s;ter, and, originally, one of the large&s;t, as will appear in the &s;equel of this hi&s;tory, when we come to mention the &s;everal large towns which have been &s;et off from it. So early as in the year 1645, <HI>Sholan,</HI> alias <HI>Shaumauw,</HI> proprietor of <HI>Na&s;hawogg,</HI> and Sachem of the <HI>Na&s;ha|ways,</HI> who lived at <HI>Wau&s;hacum,</HI> (which is in Ster|ling) informed Mr. Thomas King of Watertown, with whom he traded, and for whom he had a re|&s;pect, of this tract of land as well accommodated for a plantation, de&s;iring the Engli&s;h would come and &s;et down by him. Accordingly, Mr. King, Mr. John Pre&s;cot, Harmon Garret, Thomas Skid|more, Mr. Day, Mr. Symonds, with others, pro|cured of &s;aid <HI>Sholan,</HI> a deed of Na&s;hawogg, ten miles in lengh, and eight in breadth, under the&s;e re&s;trictions, that the Engli&s;h &s;hould not mole&s;t the Indians in their hunting, fi&s;hing, or u&s;ual planting places.&mdash;And the General Court confirmed the deed. And here we ought to ob&s;erve, the fidelity of <HI>Sholan</HI> who conveyed this tract of land to the Engli&s;h, that he always behaved in a peaceable, friendly manner towards them. As did al&s;o <HI>Mat|thew,</HI> his nephew, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or as Sachem; but <HI>Sag|amore Sam,</HI> nephew to Matthew, and &s;ucceeded him, was of a different temper and character; and, join|ing with Philip in his rebellion, was taken by the Engli&s;h, and executed as a rebel. They of the

tribe who &s;urvived this war of Philip's divided; one part moving to Albany, and the other to Pen|nicook, with which tribe they incorporated.</P>
<P>Let us return from this digre&s;&s;ion. Mr. King &s;old all his intere&s;t in this grant to his a&s;&s;ociates, who having given lots of land to Richard Linton, Lawrence Waters, and John Ball, &s;ent them up to perform divers things at the common expen&s;e of the proprietors: And the&s;e were the fir&s;t inhabi|tants. For the &s;pace of &s;even years little was done to forward the &s;ettlement of the plantation; nev|erthele&s;s, there being nine families in the place, they petitioned the General Court to be incorpora|ted as a town, which was granted on the 18th of May, 1653, and the name of Lanca&s;ter was given to it.</P>
<P>The town was in peace and pro&s;perity for the &s;pace of twenty two years, from its incorporation&mdash; and the Indians were very &s;erviceable to the inhab|itants, by &s;upplying them, on rea&s;onable terms, with &s;uch corn and wild meat as they needed.</P>
<P>But on the 24th of June, 1675, Philip, Sachem of Pocanoket, commonly called <HI>King Philip,</HI> re|belled again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and commenced a mo&s;t bloody and de&s;tructive war.&mdash;And on the 22d of Augu&s;t following, eight per&s;ons, viz. George Ben|net, William Fagg, Jacob Farrar, Jo&s;eph Wheeler, Mordecai MacLoad, with his wife and two of their children, were killed in different parts of the town. The Narragan&s;et Indians, joining Philip in his rebellion, marched into the country, and per&s;uad|ed the Nipnets and Na&s;haways to take up arms al|&s;o again&s;t the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="026481_0037_0FD056370899A130">Philip at the head of about 1500 Indians, marched for Lanca&s;ter, in which there were then above fifty families.

Jonas Fairbank, Jo&s;hua Fairbank, Richard Wheeler, Ephraim Sawyer, Henry Farrar, and Mr. Ball and wife. However, they de&s;troyed no garri&s;on, but that round the Rev.

In this &s;tate of de&s;olation, the town continued about four years; during which time the Rev. Mr. Rowland&s;on preached at Wethersfield in Connecti|cut, and there he died, before the re&s;ettlement of the town. From 1680 to the year 1692, they were not mole&s;ted in the re&s;ettlement of the town. But the French king e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of James the &s;econd in 1688, who had abdicated the Briti&s;h throne, involved the nation in a war with France, and Newengland in a war with the Canadians, both French and Indians: In the calamities of which this town had a large &s;hare. For, on the 18th of July 1692, the Indians a&s;&s;aulted the hou&s;e of Peter Jo&s;lin, who was at his labour in the field; and knew nothing thereof, until, entering the hou&s;e, he found his wife and three children, with a widow Whitcomb, who lived in his family, barbarou&s;ly butchered with their hatchets, and weltering in their blood.

<P>In 1704, a large army of French and Indians came from Canada, with a de&s;ign to de&s;troy North|ampton, but, finding they were prepared to receive them, they turned their cour&s;e towards Lanca&s;ter; and on the 31&s;t of July, early in the morning, they fell furiou&s;ly upon the town; and in their fir&s;t on&s;et killed Lieut. Nathaniel Wilder, near the

<P>The enemy were uncommonly brave, and there|fore, though Capt. Tyng, who commanded the &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on, and Capt. How, with a company from Marlborough, who marched imme|diately to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, together with the in|habitants of the town, maintained a warm conflict with them, for &s;ome time, yet being much inferior in number were obliged to retreat into the garri|&s;on. Upon this the enemy burned the meeting|hou&s;e, and &s;ix other buildings, and de&s;troyed much of the live &s;tock of the town. Before night there came &s;uch numbers to the relief of the town, that the enemy retreated; and though pur&s;ued, were not overtaken.</P>

<P>The Indians treated Mr. Sawyer with much cruelty, but at length they arrived at Montreal.

The Governor readily clo&s;ed with the propo&s;al, as, at that time, there was no &s;awmill in all Canada, nor artificer capable of building one. He accordingly applied to the Indians, and obtained the ran&s;om of young Sawyer and Biglow, without the lea&s;t difficulty; but no &s;um would purcha&s;e Mr. Sawyer's redemp|tion: Him, (being di&s;tingui&s;hed for his bravery, which had proved fatal to a number of their breth|ren)

Mr. Harrington, in a century &s;ermon he preached there on the 28th of May, 1753.</P>
<P>I will now proceed to give &s;ome particular ac|count of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate of this town, from its beginning.&mdash;It was incorporated, as we have &s;aid, in 1653. The following year, Mr. Jo&s;eph Rowland&s;on preached among the people, and con|tinued &s;o doing, until April 14th, 1658, when they invited him to &s;ettle with them in the work of the mini&s;try; their invitation he accepted, and proba|bly was ordained the &s;ame year, at which time, no doubt the Church of Chri&s;t was gathered here: Al|though of the&s;e things we cannot &s;peak with cer|tainty, &s;ince the records of the Church, in Mr. Rowland&s;on's time, were, in all probability, con|&s;umed in his garri&s;on. As the town was wholly broken up and de&s;troyed, as above related, in 1676, &s;o the Rev. Mr. Rowland&s;on continued with the people from the fir&s;t but about 22 years, and died before the re&s;ettlement of the town.&mdash;The place lay in ruins about four years. In 1680, they began to re&s;ettle: And divers gentlemen preached with them. In February, 1688, Mr. John Whit|ing was invited to preach with them on probation; and continued preaching until November, 1690, when he was invited to take the over&s;ight of them
<PB N="47" REF="026481_0046_0FD0564489B225B0">
in the Lord; and he, accepting their invitation was, probably, &s;oon after ordained.</P>
<P>But we cannot be certain of the preci&s;e day, as no records of the time of his mini&s;try have ever been found.&mdash;He continued but a &s;hort &s;pace, in the &s;acred office, being cut off, by the enemy, as before mentioned, on the 11th of September, 1697.</P>
<P>In May, 1701, Mr. Andrew Gardner, began to preach at Lanca&s;ter, and in September following the people gave him a call to &s;ettle with them in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. This invitation he accepted, and his ordination was appointed; but before the day came a &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing death arre&s;ted him: Being unfortunately, but mor|tally wounded in the hou&s;e of his friends, in his own garri&s;on, in the night following the 26th of October, 1704; the particulars of which have been related above.</P>
<P>In May, 1705, Mr. John Prentice came to preach among this people, and &s;upplied the de&s;k until February, 1707, when he received an invitation to &s;ettle among them, which he accepted; and he was accordingly, &s;olemnly &s;eparated unto this &s;a|cred employment on the 29th of March, 1708. In his day there was peace, and the town grew and flouri&s;hed exceedingly: For during his mini&s;try, from his dioce&s;e were formed the towns of Harv|ard, Bolton, Leomin&s;ter, and the &s;econd precinct, which is now called Sterling. He was a good and faithful &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, continuing in his office almo&s;t forty years, living much beloved; and died greatly lamented, on the 6th of January. 1748.

The breach made upon the Church and town was happily repaired the en&s;uing fall, in the in&s;tallment of the Rev. Timothy Harrington, to the pa&s;toral of|fice among them, November 16th, 1748; who &s;till continues, in an advanced age.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Harrington, through age and bod|ily infirmities, being taken off from his publick la|bours, the people of Lanca&s;ter have invited Mr. Nathaniel Thayer, to &s;ettle with them in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, as colleague with the vener|able Mr. Harrington, who, having accepted their invitation, is, by the leave of Providence, to be &s;ol|emnly &s;eparated unto the &s;ame October 9th, 1793.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that although this place was greatly frowned upon, in their early days, in the &s;hort lives, and premature deaths of their fir&s;t mini&s;ters, yet &s;ince that time, the people have been as &s;ignally &s;miled upon, and bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the long and u&s;eful lives of two eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ters in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, who&s;e cour&s;es together ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p the long &s;pace of 84 years.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Harrington, was fir&s;t &s;ettled in the mini&s;try at a place then called, <HI>Lower A&s;huelot, now Swanzey,</HI> in the &s;tate of Newhamp&s;hire: Here he was ordained November 16th, 1741. This place was totally de&s;troyed by the Indians on the 2d of April, 1747, from whence he was driven with his family and flock. The people of Lanca&s;|ter having invited Mr. Harrington to &s;ettle with them, and there being no pro&s;pect of the return of his former Church and flock to A&s;huelot, he fir&s;t obtained a regular di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from them, and there|upon

<P>Let us return; the town of Lanca&s;ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all the appearances of age. A number of gentlemen have built very elegant &s;eats here: And there are a con&s;iderable number of &s;tores and &s;hops in the town.

<P>In this town there is e&s;tabli&s;hed a Lodge of Free Ma&s;ons, the hi&s;tory whereof is as follows. Upon the petition of a number of gentlemen to the ancient Grand Lodge of free and accepted Ma|&s;ons, a charter was granted January 31, 1778, to the petitioners, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for holding a Lodge in Lanca&s;ter, by the name of <HI>Trinity Lodge.</HI> This is held on the fir&s;t Tue&s;day evenings in each month.

<P>We proceed to a Geographical, and Topo|graphical de&s;cription of Lanca&s;ter. It is about nine miles in length from north to &s;outh, and four in width from ea&s;t to we&s;t: Bounded by Lunenburgh and Leomin&s;ter on the north and north we&s;t; by Shirley in the county of Middle&s;ex, on the north|ea&s;t; by Harvard, Bolton and Berlin, on the ea&s;t; by Boyl&s;ton on the &s;outh, and by Sterling on the we&s;t. The body of the town is &s;ituated on low and level lands near the intervals; and &s;o as to afford an agreeable pro&s;pect of a con&s;iderable part of it. There are two main branches of the River Na&s;haway. The north branch originates from a Pond in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and, running through Fitch|burgh and Leomin&s;ter, enters Lanca&s;ter in the North we&s;t part of the town; and pur&s;ues a &s;outhea&s;t cour&s;e into the middle of it, within a few rods of the meetinghou&s;e. The &s;outh branch &s;prings up from the foot of Watchu&s;ett, in Princeton, and running through Sterling and Boyl&s;ton, enters at the &s;outh|we&s;t angle of the town; then running northea&s;ter|ly, meets the north branch about half a mile below the meetinghou&s;e; and then, keeping a northea&s;|tern cour&s;e, enters Shirley. On both branches and
<PB N="51" REF="026481_0050_0FD0564B4A5994F8">
within the town of Lanca&s;ter they have corn and &s;aw mills. There are nine large bridges within the town: Two on the north branch, three on the &s;outh, and four after their junction. None are le&s;s than five rods in length; and the fir&s;t af|ter the confluence of the&s;e waters is planked ten rods. On the two branches, and after they unite, there is a va&s;t body of exceeding rich <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">terval land, of a great depth of &s;oil, and which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t excel|lent for gra&s;s, and produces in abundance the be&s;t of hay. This interval is al&s;o good for rai&s;ing flax and hemp: It is al&s;o good for Indian corn; and a &s;team of fog from the waters pre&s;erves the corn in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he intervals, when at the di&s;tance of ten or fifteen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ods, the corn will be de&s;troyed by fro&s;ts. The river Na&s;haway overflows the whole interval, of nearly 3000 acres, twice in a year, in the &s;pring, and in autumn and in &s;ome places two miles in width. Sometimes it has overflowed the interval lands in &s;ummer; and then it has generally done va&s;t damage, by carrying off fences, great quanti|ties of hay and flax, &amp;c. and de&s;troyed large fields of Indian corn. In 1787, by a fre&s;het, a &s;aw mill, on the north branch, about two miles from the meetinghou&s;e, was &s;wept off, and about three acres of good rich interval land wa&s;hed away to the depth of 12 feet, leaving only a bed of cobble &s;tones, en|tirely u&s;ele&s;s.

<P>In this town when the general cen&s;us was taken, in the year 1791, there were 214 hou&s;es, and 1460 inhabitants. The town is ju&s;t about 40 miles from Bo&s;ton, very little to the north of we&s;t, and 14 miles from the Courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter a lit|tle to the northea&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>MENDON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a very ancient town indeed, the &s;econd in age in the county. It was an orig|inal grant to certain per&s;ons, of eight miles &s;quare, made by the General Court, at an early period, we cannot &s;ay exactly when; it was called Quan&s;hi|pauge by the natives. It was incorporated by an Act of the Legi&s;lature, on the 15th of May, 1667, and the name of Mendon given to it. It was lo|cated, a plan drawn, and return made to the General Court, by a Mr. Jo&s;hua Fi&s;her. After the Province line was &s;ettled, it was again &s;ur|veyed, and a plan of it drawn by a Mr. William
<PB N="55" REF="026481_0054_0FD05651484FEE00">
Rider, in the year 1725; according to which plan its boundaries and extent were as follow, begin|ning at &s;outhwe&s;t corner it ran ea&s;t &s;even and an half miles on the line between Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Rhodei&s;land; then north four miles and 40 rods; then ea&s;t, one mile by a river; then north again, three miles and 280 rods; then we&s;t, eight and an half miles; then &s;outh eight miles, to the fir&s;t bounds. But this mea&s;ure mu&s;t be very large, &s;ince all Uxbridge, almo&s;t the whole of North|bridge, and a large part of Upton were taken from Mendon, together with Milford; and &s;till there re|main two pari&s;hes in the town. Its pre&s;ent bounda|ries by actual &s;urvey, are &s;outh, by Rhodei&s;land State, &s;ix miles and a quarter; on the we&s;t, by Uxbridge and Northbridge, &s;even miles and 140 rods to Up|ton line; northwe&s;t, by Upton, two miles; northea&s;t, by Milford, four miles and a quarter; ea&s;t, by Bel|lingham in the county of Suffolk, four miles and three quarters. When they held their fir&s;t town meeting, or fir&s;t acted as a corporate body, does not appear, nor when the Church was gathered and the fir&s;t mini&s;ter was &s;ettled. Here, as in &s;ome other in&s;tances we may meet with, we have to lament the entire want of ancient records. If ever any records were kept in tho&s;e early days, of the&s;e matters, they were lo&s;t when the town was broken up in the time of the Indian wars, or in &s;ome other way. We have al&s;o to regret the ob|&s;curity and defects attending &s;uch records as are to be found.</P>
<P>In little more than eight years from the incor|poration of Mendon, commenced the Narragan&s;et,
<PB N="56" REF="026481_0055_0FD05652C92D2EA0">
or King Philip's war. And all that I can find in "Hubbard's hi&s;tory of the Indian wars," or in "Governor Hutchin&s;on's hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts," or by any other way, is this, viz. "On the 14th of July, 1675, the Nipnet or Nipmuck Indians, killed four or five people at Mendon." And this was the fir&s;t mi&s;chief ever done by the Indians with|in the ancient limits of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. For it mu&s;t be remembered, that the colony of Plymouth was not annexed to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts until the charter from William and Mary in 1691. I cannot find that ever any other mi&s;chief was done by the In|dians in Mendon, except the abovementioned. However the people then here were in &s;uch fear and danger, as that the town was entirely broken up for &s;ome time, and mo&s;t or all of them moved off. How long the place remained de&s;olate, we are un|able to &s;ay with certainty. It could not be long, as will appear by the following account of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate of Mendon.</P>
<P>All we can find on record is &s;imply this&mdash;"The Rev. Jo&s;eph Emer&s;on was the fir&s;t Pa&s;tor of the Church in Mendon. He lived here before the war, known by the &s;tile of King Philip's Indian war." I add, in this war the town and church were broken up, and Mr. Emer&s;on never returned to officiate with them in the pa&s;toral office. Tra|dition &s;ays, he was mini&s;ter here about eight years, this will carry back the date of his ordination, and the gathering of the Church, to the year 1667, that is, to about the time when the town was incorporat|ed.&mdash;The records go on to &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="026481_0056_0FD056544C8F1A68">"The Rev. Grindall Raw&s;on was the &s;econd Pa&s;tor of the Church in this town. He was or|dained in the 20th year of his age. He died Feb|ruary the 6th, 1715, in the 57th year of his age, and 37th of his mini&s;try." But here we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, his tomb&s;tone &s;ays, "he died in the 35th year of his mini&s;try:" And this is the more proba|ble for &s;everal rea&s;ons. According to the town record, he mu&s;t have been &s;ettled in the year 1678, which is carrying it back too near the time when the town was broken up: And con&s;idering the then &s;tate of the country, in con&s;tant fear, and great danger from the Indians, it is not at all likely they &s;hould re&s;ettle &s;o &s;oon; but in the year 1680 they probably might.</P>
<P>The records further &s;ay, "The Rev. Jo&s;eph Dorr was the third Pa&s;tor of this Church. He died March 9th, 1768, in the 79th year of his age, and the 52d year of his mini&s;try." This will carry back the time of the Rev. Mr. Dorr's ordination to the year, 1716. The Rev. Jo&s;eph Willard &s;ucceeded Mr. Dorr in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try in Mendon, whereunto he was &s;olemnly con&s;ecrated on the 19th of April, 1769. He was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;toral relation to this Church and people, on the 4th of December, 1782, in the 13th year of his mini&s;try. This di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Willard was occa&s;ioned by the coldne&s;s and inattention of the people. The Rev. Mr. Willard was in&s;talled Pa&s;tor of the Church and flock of God in Boxborough, in the county of Middle&s;ex, on the 2d of November, 1785, where he lives in
<PB N="58" REF="026481_0057_0FD05655C8E0ACB0">
peace and harmony with his people. The Rev. Caleb Alexander &s;ucceeded Mr. Willard as Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Church and congregation in Mendon, (the fifth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion) where he was in&s;talled the 12th of April, 1786, in the 31&s;t year of his age, and where he continues in his &s;acred employment. This gentleman had been previou&s;ly &s;ettled at New|marlborough in the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nty of Berk&s;hire for a &s;hort &s;pace.</P>
<P>There is a &s;econd pari&s;h in this town, which was incorporated as a di&s;tinct precinct for mini&s;terial purpo&s;es, by the appellation of "The &s;outh pari&s;h in Mendon," in the year 1766. In this &s;ame year the congr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gational inhabitants of this pari&s;h began to build them a meetinghou&s;e for the publick wor&s;hip of God, and accompli&s;hed the work in a &s;hort time. And in the year 1768, the Church of Chri&s;t, in this &s;outh pari&s;h was imbodi|ed, and the Rev. Benjamin Balch was ordained their Pa&s;tor. And on Saturday morning March 27th, 1772, before daylight, Mr. Balch left the pari&s;h, without knowledge or con&s;ent of the people of his charge. Mr. Balch was, a few years &s;ince, in&s;talled at Barrington in Newhamp&s;hire. About one half of the people of this &s;outh pari&s;h have been Anabapti&s;ts and Quakers, ever &s;ince that part of the town was fir&s;t &s;ettled, which was about 90 years ago. And from the time when Mr. Balch left this pari&s;h, the congregational intere&s;t therein has been in a declining &s;tate. They &s;eldom have any preaching; nor is there any pre&s;ent pro&s;pect of
<PB N="59" REF="026481_0058_0FD05657492A34E8">
their ever having another mini&s;ter &s;ettled among them.</P>
<P>As to the religious &s;tate of both pari&s;hes in Men|don, let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, there are, in general, three denominations, Congregationali&s;ts, Anabapti&s;ts, and Friends. There is another cla&s;s without a name. A &s;mall &s;ociety of Friends are very punc|tual in attending their form of wor&s;hip; and they have a very decent meetinghou&s;e for the purpo&s;e. Some who are, politically, Friends, do not intere&s;t them&s;elves much in any form. There is not in the town any incorporated &s;ociety of Anabapti&s;ts. They who are of this per&s;ua&s;ion, go &s;ometimes on the &s;abbath to other towns, to attend publick wor|&s;hip, in their way.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid what will be thought &s;ufficient, re|&s;pecting the religious &s;tate and eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity of Mendon, &s;ome Geographical De&s;cription of the town &s;hall now be pre&s;ented to the reader.</P>
<P>The land, in general, is good, though there is &s;ome which is rough and hard: The &s;oil is rich and very productive. It is mo&s;tly high, hilly land, yet not very uneven: And there is a &s;ufficiency of &s;tones to fence their farms. The old pari&s;h abounds principally in mowing and pa&s;ture land. The &s;outh pari&s;h is better adapted to grain. The town is excellent for orcharding, and all kinds of fruit trees. There are three high hills in this place, from either of which the four Newengland States, may be &s;een, in a fair day. They are known by the following names, <HI>Caleb</HI>'s <HI>Hill,</HI> this is near the centre of the town; <HI>Wigwam Hill,</HI> is &s;ituated a lit|tle
<PB N="60" REF="026481_0059_0FD05658C94C10E0">
to the &s;outh we&s;t, from Caleb's Hill; and <HI>Mi&s;|kee</HI> or Mi&s;queo Hill, this lies in the northwe&s;t corner of the town, and part of it falls within the limits of Upton.</P>
<P>The groves of wood here are, in general, very thrifty and tall, con&s;i&s;ting for the mo&s;t part of walnut and oak. There are fine fore&s;ts of mo&s;t excellent che&s;nut, &s;uitable for buildings or for fences.</P>
<P>The town of Mendon, like almo&s;t all other high, hilly, rocky places, is moi&s;t, rich, &s;trong land, well watered with numerous &s;prings and rivulets: But there are no &s;treams of note, except two: The fir&s;t is Charles River, which touches on the ea&s;tern part of this town. This River takes its ri&s;e from a mar&s;hy place in the &s;outhwe&s;t part of Hopkin|ton, in the county of Middle&s;ex, and runs &s;outh, through Milford in this county, and the ea&s;terly part of Mendon, and then pa&s;&s;es on to Belling|ham, in the county of Suffolk. The &s;econd is Mill River, which al&s;o originates in the &s;outhwe&s;t|ern part of Hopkinton, and, running through the we&s;tern part of Milford, pa&s;&s;es through the ea&s;ter|ly &s;ide of Mendon, and cro&s;&s;ing the road to Provi|dence, joins Black&s;tone River, near Win&s;ooket Falls, in the town of Cumberland, in the State of Rhodei&s;land. There is but one Pond in this town, &s;ituated in the we&s;tern part of it, and called <HI>Taft</HI>'s <HI>Pond</HI>; it is large, and affords great plenty of the u&s;ual &s;orts of hook fi&s;h. There is no vi&s;ible &s;tream which runs into this pond; but a &s;tream i&s;&s;ues from it &s;ufficient to carry a gri&s;t mill. On
<PB N="61" REF="026481_0060_0FD0565A4A573398">
the&s;e rivers and &s;treams, within the town, there are five gri&s;t mills, two &s;aw mills, two clothiers' works, and one forge. There is &s;ome good inter|val lands upon the&s;e &s;treams, and &s;ome bodies of excellent meadows, and indu&s;try might make more.</P>
<P>The people &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by farming; they have indeed the common mechanicks, and one or two dealers in European, Ea&s;t and We&s;tindia goods: And here they have both pot and pearl a&s;h works.</P>
<P>The place derives great benefit from the pub|lick roads which pa&s;s through it in various direc|tions. The road from the northerly part of Con|necticut, pa&s;&s;es through Mendon to Bo&s;ton. The po&s;t road from Worce&s;ter to Providence al&s;o goes through this town; as al&s;o a road, of much travel, from Vermont and Newhamp&s;hire, and the north part of the county of Worce&s;ter into the State of Rhodei&s;land. Mendon is &s;ituated quite at the &s;outhea&s;t angle of the county; and is 37 miles from Bo&s;ton, to the &s;outhwe&s;t, and 18 miles from the Courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter. When the late enu|meration was made there were 222 dwelling hou&s;es, and 1555 inhabitants, in the place. It has &s;tood as the twelfth among the towns, in the proportion it pays to a &s;tate tax.</P>

<HEAD>BROOKFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the third town in age, and the fir&s;t as to its wealth and number, in the coun|ty, containing, when the cen&s;us was taken, 438 dwelling hou&s;es, and 3100 inhabitants. A num|ber of inhabitants of Ip&s;wich, in the county of E&s;|&s;ex, petitioned the General Court for a tract of land, and obtained their reque&s;t, in the words following, "At a great and general Court of election held at Bo&s;ton the 20th of May, 1660. In an&s;wer to a petition of &s;everal inhabitants of Ip&s;wich, this court judgeth it meet to grant the petitioners &s;ix miles &s;quare, or &s;o much land as &s;hall be contained in &s;uch a compa&s;s, in a place near Quaboag pond." The grantees, that they might have a ju&s;t and equitable, as well as a legal, right to the land, pur|cha&s;ed it of the natives, who claimed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and it was conveyed to them by deed. Not|with&s;tanding the great di&s;advantages under which they then laboured, in the infancy of our country, in the mid&s;t of the Indian enemy, and no Engli&s;h &s;ettlements nearer than Marlborough on the ea&s;t, and Springfield on the we&s;t, the inhabitants &s;o in|crea&s;ed and flouri&s;hed, as that upon application to the General Court, they were incorporated into a town&s;hip, by the name of Brookfield, by an act which bears date, October 15th, 1673. But the court appointed and continued a committee of three gentlemen, belonging to other places, to di|rect,
<PB N="63" REF="026481_0062_0FD0565D4A9EAC78">
regulate and ratify all affairs relative to &s;ettling and building up the town. A committee, appoint|ed as afore&s;aid, petitioned the General Court to be relea&s;ed from &s;uch &s;ervices, and prayed that the in|habitants might be left to conduct and manage their own affairs, which was granted November 12th&punc; 1718. The inhabitants, not &s;atisfied with their fir&s;t grant, petitioned the Court for more land, when an act pa&s;&s;ed December 3, 1719, making the town eight miles &s;quare.</P>
<P>In the year 1675, not two years after its incor|poration, Brookfield was utterly de&s;troyed by the Indians, when the inhabitants con&s;i&s;ted of about twenty families; they had then a hou&s;e for pub|lick wor&s;hip, and preaching, but no &s;ettled mini&s;|ter. The circum&s;tances of its de&s;olation are of im|portance to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, and I &s;hall relate them, as I have collected and laid them to|gether from the late Governor Hutchin&s;on's hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, the Rev. Mr. Hubbard's hi&s;tory of the Indian war, and Capt. Thomas Wheeler's narrative thereof. "The Nipnet or Nipmuck <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The&s;e were &s;eated upon le&s;s rivers and lakes, or large ponds, where Oxford now is, and towns near it."

Edward Hutchin&s;on, of Bo&s;ton, to Quaboag, Brookfield, near which place there was to be a great rendezvous of tho&s;e Indians, to treat with &s;everal Sachems, in order to the publick peace: and ordered Capt. Thomas Wheeler, of Concord, with a part of his troop, about 20 men, to accom|pany
<PB N="64" REF="026481_0063_0FD0565EC9CC3D60">
him for &s;ecurity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They ar|rived on the Lord's day, Augu&s;t the 1&s;t, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Indians, de&s;iring to treat with them. Three of the chief Sachems promi&s;ed to meet them next morning about eight o'clock, Augu&s;t 2d, upon a plain at the head of Wickaboug Pond, two or three miles we&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e. Captains Hutch|in&s;on and Wheeler, with their company, and three of the principal inhabitants of Brookfield, Capt. John Ayres, John Coye, and Jo&s;eph Pritchard, re|&s;orted thither at the appointed time, but found not the Indians there. They then rode forward about four or five miles towards the Nipnet's chief town. When they came to a place called Mominimi&s;&s;et, a narrow pa&s;&s;age, between a &s;teep hill and a thick &s;wamp, they were ambu&s;hed by two or three hundred Indians, who &s;hot down eight of the company, viz. Zechariah Phillips of Bo&s;ton, Timothy Farley of Billerica, Edward Colburn of Chelmsford, Samuel Smedley of Concord, Syd|rach Hapgood of Sudbury, and Capt. Ayres, John Coye and Jo&s;eph Pritchard of Brookfield, named above, and mortally wounded Capt. Hutchin&s;on. The re&s;t e&s;caped, through a bye path, to Brook|field. The Indians flocked into the town; but the inhabitants, being alarmed, had all got together in the principal hou&s;e, on an eminence, a little to the &s;outhea&s;t of where the we&s;t pari&s;h meetinghou&s;e now &s;tands. They had the mortification to &s;ee all their dwelling hou&s;es, about 20, with all their barns and outhou&s;es burnt. The hou&s;e where they had a&s;&s;embled, was then &s;urrounded, and a variety of
<PB N="65" REF="026481_0064_0FD05660481922A8">
attempts were made for two days and nights to &s;et fire to it, but did not &s;ucceed. At length, Au|gu&s;t 4th, at evening, the Indians filled a cart with hemp, and other combu&s;tible matter, which they kindled, and endeavoured to thru&s;t to the hou&s;e in order to fire it; but this attempt was defeated, partly by a &s;hower of rain which fell and wet the materials, as Capt. Wheeler &s;ays in his narrative, who was on the &s;pot, and partly by aid arriving: For Major Willard, who had been &s;ent after &s;ome other Indians we&s;tward of Lanca&s;ter and Groton, hearing of the di&s;tre&s;s of Brookfield, when he was about four or five miles from Lanca&s;ter, altered his cour&s;e, and the &s;ame night reached Brookfield, with Capt. Parker, and 46 men about an hour after it was dark, after a tedious march of 30 miles. And though the Indian &s;couts di&s;cov|ered him and fired their alarm guns, yet the main body, from their high joy, always accompanied with a horrid noi&s;e, heard them not. Willard joined the be&s;ieged, and the Indians immediately poured in all the &s;hot they could, but without ex|ecution, and then burning all the buildings, ex|cept this garri&s;on, and de&s;troying all the hor&s;es and cattle they could find, withdrew to their dens. They were not pur&s;ued being much &s;uperiour in number.</P>
<P>It is fitting to add to the above, the very partic|ular account, which the Rev. Dr. Fi&s;ke of Brook|field, has given in a marginal note, annexed to an hi&s;torical di&s;cour&s;e concerning the &s;ettlement of this town, and its di&s;tre&s;&s;es during the Indian wars,
<PB N="66" REF="026481_0065_0FD05661CEACAB08">
preached December 31&s;t, 1775, and immediately publi&s;hed. The account is as follows, viz. "That three of the men killed in the ambu&s;hment, belong|ed to Brookfield, as above named: That when the Indians pur&s;ued the party into the town, they &s;et fire to all the buildings except a few in the neigh|bourhood of the hou&s;e in which the inhabitants had taken &s;helter: That they endeavoured to inter|cept five or &s;ix men who had gone to a neighbour|ing hou&s;e to &s;ecure &s;ome things there: But they all got &s;afe to the place of refuge, except a young man, Samuel Pritchard, who was &s;topped &s;hort by a fatal bullet: That the hou&s;e in which they were be&s;ieged was unfortified, except by a few logs ha&s;ti|ly tumbled up on the out&s;ide, after the alarm, and by a few feather beds hung up on the in&s;ide. And though the &s;iege continued from Monday in the afternoon, until early on Thur&s;day morning, Au|gu&s;t 5th, in which time innumerable balls entered the hou&s;e, only one man, Henry Young, who was in the chamber, was killed. The Indians &s;hot ma|ny fire arrows to burn the hou&s;e, but without ef|fect.&mdash;When the troop which relieved Brookfield, got into the town, which was late at night, they were joined by great numbers of cattle, which had collected together in their fright at the conflagra|tion of the buildings, and the firing and war whoops of the Indians: and for protection the&s;e poor ani|mals followed the troop till they arrived at the be|&s;ieged hou&s;e. The Indians deceived hereby, and thinking there was a much larger number of hor&s;e|men than there really was, immediately &s;et fire to

the barn belonging to the be&s;ieged hou&s;e, and to Jo&s;eph Pritchard's hou&s;e and barn, and the meet|inghou&s;e, which were the only buildings left un|burnt, and went off. A garri&s;on was maintained at this hou&s;e till winter, when the court ordered the people away, &s;oon after which the Indians came and burnt this hou&s;e al&s;o."</P>
<P>Having mentioned Major Willard, Capt. Hutch|in&s;on and Capt. Wheeler, it will be proper to &s;ay &s;omething further re&s;pecting each of them.&mdash;Cap|tains Hutchin&s;on and Wheeler, tarried at Brook|field until Augu&s;t 13th, and then, with mo&s;t of their men, &s;et off for their homes; they arrived at Marlborough the next day, where Capt. Hutch|in&s;on, fatigued with his journey and his wound growing wor&s;e, died Augu&s;t 19th, and was there buried the next day, Augu&s;t 20th, 1675.</P>
<P>Captain Wheeler, who accompanied Capt. Hutchin&s;on, and &s;aw him buried, the next day, Augu&s;t 21&s;t, arrived &s;afe at Concord, where he and they who returned with him, kept October 21&s;t, 1675, as a day of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to God for their remarkable deliverance and &s;afe return, when the Rev. Mr. Bulkley of Concord preached a &s;ermon to them from tho&s;e words in P&s;alm cxvi.12, &iquest; "What &s;hall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?" which was printed.</P>
<P>Major Willard tarried at Brookfield, and at Hadley and the adjacent towns, for &s;everal weeks, and then returned to Groton, where the &s;afety of that and &s;ome neighbouring towns required his pre&s;ence. He was &s;oon after di&s;placed for going
<PB N="68" REF="026481_0067_0FD05664C9EB3AF8">
to Brookfield without orders, or while under orders to march another way. The Rev. Dr. Fi&s;ke's ob|&s;ervations hereupon in a note, are well worthy in|&s;ertion in this place. "Major Willard's conduct in altering his cour&s;e and coming to the relief of Brookfield, being dictated by humanity and exe|cuted with bravery and &s;ucce&s;s, has gained him the applau&s;e of people in general. But as it was be&s;ide his orders, he was cen&s;ured by the court and ca&s;hier|ed, which di&s;gu&s;ted his friends, and broke his heart. And though the puni&s;hment may &s;eem too rigor|ous, yet it is to be remembered, that if commanders of parties, &s;ent upon particular expeditions, may take liberty to vary from their expre&s;s orders, nothing ef|fectual could be accompli&s;hed, and only confu&s;ion, di&s;appointment, lo&s;s, and in many ca&s;es ruin, would be likely to en&s;ue."</P>
<P>To return to Brookfield. The town, totally de|&s;troyed by the Indians in Augu&s;t 1675, lay in ru|ins &s;everal years, and the inhabitants were di&s;per&s;|ed. "But, &s;ays the Rev. Dr. Fi&s;ke, in the &s;ermon above referred to, peace being &s;ettled with the Indians, &s;ome of the di&s;per&s;ed, after a while, re|turned to the place of their former habitation, and in conjunction with others, gradually re|&s;ettled the town, &s;o that in the year 1692, they had a committee appointed by the court, as formerly, to direct and regulate the &s;ettlement of &s;aid plantation and the affairs thereof. But it be|ing &s;till in the mid&s;t of a wilderne&s;s, and always expo&s;ed to the blood thir&s;ty &s;avages, whenever they

&s;hould take it into their heads to mole&s;t the En|gli&s;h, its increa&s;e and improvements were &s;low."</P>
<P>In the war which is commonly denominated Queen Anne's war, which broke out not long after the re&s;ettlement of the town, and continued &s;everal years, Brookfield, as well as many other towns, was greatly hara&s;&s;ed and annoyed; the Indians frequently making &s;udden inroads, killing and &s;calping, or captivating one and another of the in|habitants. During this war, a number of men, women and children were killed, &s;everal taken pri&s;oners, and &s;ome were wounded. The particu|lars are as follow, as related by the Rev. Dr. Fi&s;ke, in the &s;ermon above referred to. "The fir&s;t mi&s;|chief was in the latter end of July or beginning of Augu&s;t 1692. A party of Indians came into the town and broke up two or three families. Jo&s;eph Woolcot being at work at a little di&s;tance from his hou&s;e, his wife, being fearful, took her children and went out to him. When they returned to the hou&s;e at noon, they found the Indians had been there, for his gun and &s;everal other things were mi&s;&s;ing. And looking out at a window he &s;aw an Indian, at &s;ome di&s;tance, coming towards the hou&s;e. He immediately &s;ent out his wife and his two little daughters to hide them&s;elves in the bu&s;h|es; and he taking his little &s;on under his arm and his broad ax in his hand, went out with his dog in &s;ight of the Indian. The dog being large and fierce, attacked the Indian &s;o furiou&s;ly, that he was obliged to di&s;charge his gun at the dog to rid him|&s;elf of him; immediately upon which Woolcot
<PB N="70" REF="026481_0069_0FD05667C9DE17B0">
&s;at down the child and pur&s;ued the Indian till he heard the bullet roll down his gun, the Indian charging as he ran; he then turned back, &s;natched up his child and made his e&s;cape, through the &s;wamps, to a fort. His wife being greatly terrified, di&s;covered by her &s;hrieks where &s;he was; and the Indian &s;oon found and di&s;patched both her and her children. Others of the party about the &s;ame time, came into the hou&s;e of one Ma&s;on while the family were at dinner. They killed Ma&s;on and one or two children, and took his wife and an infant which they had wounded, and carried them off. They al&s;o took two brothers, Thomas and Daniel Law|rence; they &s;oon di&s;patched Thomas, pretending he had mi&s;informed them about the number of men which were in the town. John Lawrence, their brother, rode with all ha&s;te to Springfield for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. A company, under Capt. Colton, came with the greate&s;t &s;peed and pur&s;ued the Indians. They found Mrs. Ma&s;on's child, which the &s;avages had knocked on the head and thrown away in the bu&s;hes; and continuing their pur&s;uit, they came upon the Indians' encampment, which was a &s;ort of bru&s;h hedge, which they deridingly called "En|gli&s;hmen's fort." The party waited till break of day, and then came &s;o near as to put their guns through this bru&s;h and fire upon the Indians, four|teen or fifteen of whom were killed, the re&s;t fled with &s;uch precipitation as to leave &s;everal of their arms, blankets, powderhorns, &amp;c. and their pri&s;on|ers, Daniel Lawrence and Mrs. Ma&s;on, whom our men conducted back. This &s;ame John Lawrence,
<PB N="71" REF="026481_0070_0FD05669491539D0">
who rode expre&s;s and procured the company which re&s;cued the abovementioned pri&s;oners, was after|wards going in company with one Samuel Owen, in &s;earch of a man who was mi&s;&s;ing; the Indians came upon them, killed Lawrence, but Owen e&s;|caped. Mary MacInto&s;h was fired upon and kill|ed as &s;he was milking her cows. Robert Grain|ger and John Clary were pa&s;&s;ing along the road, on a certain day, and being fired upon by the &s;av|ages, Grainger was killed on the &s;pot; Clary at|tempted to e&s;cape, but had not fled far before he al&s;o was &s;hot down. At another time, Thomas Battis of Brookfield, riding expre&s;s to Hadley, was killed in the wilderne&s;s, in a place now called Belchertown. Early one morning John Woolcot, a lad about twelve or fourteen years old, was rid|ing in &s;earch of the cows, when the Indians fired at him, killed his hor&s;e from under him and took him pri&s;oner. The people at Jennings's garri&s;on hearing the firing, and concluding the people at another garri&s;on were be&s;et, &s;ix men &s;et out for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but were waylayed by the Indians. The Engli&s;h &s;aw not their danger, till they &s;aw there was no e&s;caping it. And therefore, knowing that an Indian could not look an Engli&s;hman in the face, and take a right aim, they &s;tood their ground, pre&s;enting their pieces wherever they &s;aw an Indian, without di&s;charging them, excepting Abijah Bartlet, who turned to flee and was &s;hot dead. The Indians kept firing at the re&s;t and wounded three of them, Jo&s;eph Jennings in two places; one ball grazed the top of his head, by
<PB N="72" REF="026481_0071_0FD0566B4EFDF788">
which he was &s;truck blind for a moment; another ball pa&s;&s;ed through his &s;houlder, wounding his collar bone, yet by neither did he fall, nor was he mortally wounded. Benjamin Jennings was wounded in the leg, and John Green in the wri&s;t. They were pre&s;erved at la&s;t by the following &s;trat|agem. A large dog, hearing the firing, came to our men; one of whom, to encourage his breth|ren and intimidate the Indians, called out, "Capt. Williams is come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for here is his dog." The Indians, &s;eeing the dog, and knowing Williams to be a famous warrior, immediately fled, and our men e&s;caped. John Woolcot the lad a|bovementioned, was carried to Canada, where he remained &s;ix or &s;even years, during which time, by conver&s;ing wholly with Indians, he not only lo&s;t his native language, but became &s;o naturalized to the &s;avages, as to be unwilling, for a while, to re|turn to his native country. Some years afterwards, viz. in March, 1728, in a time of peace, he and an|other man having been hunting, and coming down Connecticut River with a freight of &s;kins and fur, they were hailed by &s;ome Indians; but not being willing to go to them, they &s;teered for another &s;hore. The Indians landed at a little di&s;tance from them; &s;everal &s;hots were exchanged, at length Woolcot was killed.</P>
<P>The la&s;t mi&s;chief which was done by the &s;avages, in Brookfield, was about the 20th of July, 1710. Six men, viz. Ebenezer Hayward, John White, Stephen and Benjamin Jennings, John Gro&s;venor and Jo&s;eph Kellog, were making hay in the mea|dows,
<PB N="73" REF="026481_0072_0FD0566C4892E2A0">
when the Indians, who had been watching an opportunity to &s;urpri&s;e them, &s;prung &s;uddenly upon them, di&s;patched five of them, and took the other, John White, pri&s;oner. White &s;pying a &s;mall company of our people at &s;ome di&s;tance, jumped from the Indian who held him, and ran to join his friends; but the Indian fired after him, and wounded him in the thigh, by which he fell; but &s;oon recovering and running again, he was a|gain fired at and received his death wound."</P>
<P>Great indeed were the difficulties, di&s;courage|ments and hard&s;hips, under which this then infant plantation laboured, &s;o that it was more than forty years from the breaking up of the town, and burn|ing the fir&s;t meetinghou&s;e, before they erected an|other. A church was gathered, and the Rev. Thomas Cheney was ordained their fir&s;t Pa&s;tor, the third Wedne&s;day of October, 1717.

Here a church was gathered May 28th, 1752, and the Rev. Eli Forbes was ordained their fir&s;t mini&s;ter on the third of June the &s;ame year. Mr. Harding continued the mini&s;ter of the fir&s;t precinct until the people fell into a mo&s;t unhappy controver&s;y about erecting a
<PB N="74" REF="026481_0073_0FD0566DCA760E08">
new meetinghou&s;e. The contention was &s;o &s;harp, and the oppo&s;ite parties &s;o uncomplying that they parted, and formed two di&s;tinct religious &s;ocieties. The act for dividing the fir&s;t pari&s;h, and incorporat|ing the third precinct pa&s;&s;ed November 8th, 1754. In con&s;equence hereof, Mr. Harding reque&s;ted a di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, which was granted by the church and con|firmed by a mutual eccle&s;ia&s;tical council, May 8th, 1755. After his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion the Rev. Jo&s;eph Par&s;ons was ordained Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t church and pre|cinct, on the 23d of November, 1757. A church was gathered in the third pari&s;h, or ea&s;t precinct, April 15th, 1756, and on the 24th of May, 1758, the Rev. Nathan Fi&s;ke, D. D. was ordained their &s;piritual over&s;eer, and &s;till continues. Mr. Par&s;ons continued Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t church upwards of thirteen years, being relea&s;ed from the &s;ickne&s;s and pains of this mortal &s;tate January 17th, 1771, in the fourteenth year of his mini&s;try, and 38th of his age. In about nine months after his decea&s;e, viz. on October 23d, 1771, the Rev. Ephraim Ward was &s;eparated to the pa&s;toral office, the fourth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the fir&s;t church and precinct.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Forbes continued in the faithful di&s;charge of the mini&s;terial work among the peo|ple of the &s;econd precinct almo&s;t 23 years; and on the 1&s;t of March, 1775, the pa&s;toral relation was di&s;&s;olved by mutual con&s;ent, under the conduct of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council, each party in charity with, and heartily recommending the other. To him &s;ucceeded, as &s;econd Pa&s;tor of the &s;econd precinct, the Rev. Jo&s;eph Appleton, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho was &s;ol|emnly

&s;eparated to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, October 30th, 1776.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Forbes was, June 5th, 1776, in&s;tall|ed Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t church in Glouce&s;ter, Cape Anne, where he continues, faithfully &s;erving God in the go&s;pel of his Son. It is fitting farther to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Forbes, while mini&s;ter in Brook|field, went repeatedly Chaplain to provincial regi|ments, in the la&s;t French war, to the we&s;tward, which qualified him the better to endure the hard|&s;hips and fatigues of a mi&s;&s;ion to the we&s;tern tribes of Indians, which he was reque&s;ted by the board of Commi&s;&s;ioners at Bo&s;ton to undertake. His people were at fir&s;t aver&s;e to his going; but were at length prevailed upon by a committee of that board to con&s;ent, May 30th, 1762, that he might go for a few months. He accordingly &s;et out the fir&s;t of June, with Mr. Rice, now mini&s;ter of We&s;tmin&s;ter and Mr. Eli&s;ha Gunn of Montague, for an interpreter: They followed Mohawk River about 70 miles, then turned &s;outhward to lake O&s;ti|ego near <HI>Cherry Valley,</HI> (this lake makes the head of one of the main branches of Su&s;quehannah Riv|er) cro&s;&s;ed the lake, went down that river 120 miles to a town called <HI>Onoquagie,</HI> plea&s;antly &s;ituat|ed on the ea&s;tern bank of the Su&s;quehannah, then containing 30 hou&s;es, 40 families, and 300 in|habitants, be&s;ides upwards of 20 warriors. Here they arrived June 21&s;t, 1762. Near this place were two &s;mall towns of Tu&s;caroras. Here he preached; opened two &s;chools, one for adults, and another for children; gathered a church; ad|mini&s;tered

&s;pecial ordinances to them; and left them September 1&s;t, 1762, under the care of Mr. Rice. During his &s;tay there, he baptized great numbers; &s;ome brought their children 60 and 70 miles to receive Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m: They were mo&s;tly infants, who&s;e parents had been baptized by former mi&s;&s;ionaries, or in the Dutch or Engli&s;h churches in the vicinity of Albany.</P>
<P>Having gone through with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;|tory of Brookfield, a Geographical De&s;cription thereof &s;hall now be pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Brookfield is di&s;tant from the Statehou&s;e in Bo&s;|ton between &s;ixty and &s;eventy miles. The great po&s;t road from Bo&s;ton to Newyork, runs through it; and the &s;ixty one mile &s;tone &s;tands near the ea&s;tern boundary, and the &s;eventy mile&s;tone near the we&s;tern line. This town is bounded on the ea&s;t by Spencer; on the &s;outh by Sturbridge and We&s;tern; on the we&s;t, by We&s;tern and Ware; and on the north, by Newbraintree and Oakham. It is a town&s;hip of mo&s;t excellent land in general. The face of the town is pretty uneven and &s;tony, though there are three or four plains of con&s;idera|ble extent within it, one e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t par|i&s;h, exten&s;ive, excellent for rai&s;ing grain, and beau|tiful for building &s;pots, and large tracts of mead|ow and interval upon Quaboag River, which runs in a we&s;terly direction through the town. The main branch of this river comes from Rut|land, another branch i&s;&s;ues from North Pond, &s;o called, in Leice&s;ter, and, running through Spencer, falls into Quaboag River in the ea&s;terly part of Brookfield.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="026481_0076_0FD04FD40D13ABE8">The land is generally fertile, and richly repays the cultivator for his labour and pains; and there is &s;uch a variety of &s;oils, as to be &s;uited to tillage, grazing, mowing and fruit. All kinds of grain are rai&s;ed here to advantage; and farmers here, as well as el&s;ewhere are making great improvements in hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>There is &s;o little de&s;cent in Quaboag river for five miles, that the current is very &s;luggi&s;h, the waters almo&s;t &s;tagnant, and the exten&s;ive meadows on each &s;ide are of &s;mall value in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, being &s;o liable to be overflowed. This evil has been growing for many years, through increa&s;|ing ob&s;tructions in &s;o torpi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;tream; &s;o that the gra&s;s, from being large and of good quality, is now &s;o poor, and the making it into hay &s;o uncertain, as to be very generally rejected. By much labour and expen&s;e in clearing the channel of ob&s;tructions, this evil may be cured. A trial was made la&s;t year by the proprietors of the meadows, whereof they reaped, &s;en&s;ibly, good effects; and hence are encouraged to a determined per&s;everance. Be&s;ides this flat meadow, there are large tracts of &s;waley or &s;wampy land, which yield con&s;iderable quantities of fowlmeadow and other valuable gra&s;&s;es, to the amount of two tons on an acre when made into hay.</P>
<P>There is one large pond in the &s;outh precinct of the extent of a mile &s;quare, called by the In|dians Quaboag Pond; but now more generally denominated Podunk Pond, from a tract of mead|ow adjoining, which the Indians called Podunk.
<PB N="78" REF="026481_0077_0FD05673241D8390">
Quaboag river advances directly to the very bank of this pond; then turns, almo&s;t at right angles, and runs parallel with the edge about twenty rods, leaving a narrow beach or ridge; then diverges &s;o as to form a &s;mall i&s;land, upon which &s;hrubs, alders and bu&s;hes are growing; then bends its cour&s;e and opens a channel into the pond, at the northea&s;t, running nearly through the middle of it, and pa&s;&s;es off in an outlet at the we&s;terly edge. Clo&s;e to the &s;ide of the pond where the river en|ters, is a large bridge, there being a county road along the beach of this pond, for more than half a mile; and travellers pa&s;s about twenty rods on a narrow ridge, between the river and pond, which, though very moderately &s;loping on the &s;ide next the pond, is perpendicular on the &s;ide of the river, and is generally overflowed in the &s;pring and fall, to the hazard and &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of travel|ling. This beach had formerly a row of large pines and &s;wamp white oaks growing upon it. But the floods, agitated by the winds, have &s;o wa&s;hed away the &s;oil, that the mo&s;t of them are dead and blown down, and the beach is gradually wearing away.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh of this pond, and about a quarter of a mile di&s;tant, is another pond, of not more than half the amplitude of the former, known by the name of the South Pond. This communi|cates with, and empties its redundant waters into the larger pond, by a creek or brook, except in the time of a fre&s;het, when the waters flow &s;o much
<PB N="79" REF="026481_0078_0FD056748B467D68">
fa&s;ter into the great pond as to rever&s;e the current of the brook, and repleni&s;h the le&s;&s;er.</P>
<P>There is another con&s;iderable pond in the we&s;t precinct, called Wickoboag Pond, from whence quantities of iron ore are annually collected. This pond is &s;upplied by &s;everal rivulets, and has one large outlet into the river, about twenty or thirty rods in length, called La&s;haway. The&s;e ponds and rivers, and the other &s;maller &s;treams, by which the land is inter&s;ected, are plentifully furni&s;hed with pickerel, perch, and divers other kinds of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the rivers and &s;treams in the town, there are &s;even gri&s;t mills, &s;ix &s;aw mills, and three fulling mills. Mr. Jenks, be&s;ides his mills, pro&s;ecutes the black&s;miths' bu&s;ine&s;s largely, and has two trip ham|mers, and a grind&s;tone carried by water.</P>
<P>One of the clothiers' works above referred to, is in the fir&s;t pari&s;h; a very convenient &s;ituation indeed for carrying on the clothiers' bu&s;ine&s;s in all its branches. Ellis and company are the pro|prietors hereof. About 5000 yards of cloth are annually dre&s;&s;ed at the&s;e works. The&s;e men have obtained the art of coloring &s;carlet, which com|petent judges pronounce equal to any which is imported; an art which few in this Commonwealth have attained unto.</P>
<P>In a con&s;iderable part of the low lands, the clay lies near the &s;urface. There is much clay adjoin|ing the &s;outh pond, and clay forms the bed of the river. No mines have, as yet, been di&s;covered, although &s;earch therefor has been made at no

&s;mall expen&s;e. There is &s;ome iron ore, a bed of yellow ocre nearly exhau&s;ted, and large quantities, both of mud and &s;tone, which yield copperas, and contain a &s;trong vitriolic quality. Many of the wells, both on high and low grounds, have what is called hard water. There are al&s;o &s;tones which contain &s;ulphur; but how to extract it has not yet been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>There are two large hills, principally in the fir&s;t pari&s;h. One is called Coye's Hill, and &s;uppo&s;ed to take its name from one Coye, a proprietor of, and an early inhabitant in Brookfield. This hill extends into We&s;tern. The other is called <HI>Ragged Hill,</HI> probably from its extreme rough and rocky appearance. Both the&s;e hills are excellent for mowing, for pa&s;turing, and for orcharding; and there are &s;everal very good farms upon them. Partly between the&s;e two hills there is a large ledge of rocks, which in all probability was rent a&s;under ages ago, by an earthquake: The rock on one &s;ide is &s;helving over, and the opening made is &s;ufficient to contain an hundred men; and the appearance indicates that it was formerly a place of rendez|vous for Indians. This place is called by the peo|ple of Brookfield, <HI>The Stone Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The rivers, ponds and meadows, in this town, occa&s;ion heavy fogs, which, in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, have produced putrid fevers, &amp;c. But ob&s;ervation clearly teaches that the inhabitants here are as healthy as in other places; and they who live in the low lands, as they who live on the high. This place has been famed for the longevity, and

fruitfulne&s;s of &s;ome of its inhabitants. In 1782, a Mr. Green, then above ninety, followed his fifth child, a woman in her &s;ixty &s;econd year, to the grave, above four miles, riding erect and &s;teady, on a lively hor&s;e. He died not long &s;ince, in the vicinity of Hanover in Newhamp&s;hire, aged up|wards of an 100 years. Al&s;o in 1782, died the widow Elizabeth Olds in her 92d year. Her po&s;|terity were as follow; ten children, &s;eventy three grand children, two hundred and one great grand children, and two of the fifth generation; two of her grand daughters being grandmothers. Total, two hundred and eighty &s;ix. Of the&s;e, two hundred and thirty two were living at her decea&s;e. In 1788, died Mr. Cyprian Rice, in the ninety eighth year of his age; and in a few months after died Mr. Eli&s;ha Rice, his brother, in the ninety ninth year of his age. They were born at Marlborough. They left not a numerous i&s;&s;ue. There is now living in Brookfield a Mr. Thomas Ain&s;worth, who &s;uppo&s;es he is the la&s;t &s;urviving &s;oldier who was in the famous Lovell's fight.</P>
<P>It is &s;o long &s;ince the aboriginals quitted the&s;e grounds, that their monuments are almo&s;t effaced.

<P>The inhabitants of Brookfield are chiefly farmers, though there is a proportion of mechanics, traders, and profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen.

<P>THIS was a grant made by the gov|ernment in the year 1682, to Jo&s;eph Dudley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor, to William Stoughton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Lieutenant-governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, to Major Robert Thomp|&s;on, Me&s;&s;rs. Cox and Blackwell, and their a&s;&s;oci|ates. It was &s;tiled, A tract of land lying in the Nipnet or Nipmug country. The grant expre&s;&s;ed eight miles &s;quare; but as &s;urveyed and located, it mu&s;t be near twelve miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about nine in width, from north to &s;outh, comprehending all Charlton, a part of Dudley, and a part of Ward. It was originally bounded we&s;t, on Newmedfield, (now Sturbridge) north, on a tract of land called the Country Gore,
<PB N="83" REF="026481_0082_0FD0567A8B92B138">
and Leice&s;ter; ea&s;t, on Sutton; and &s;outh, by a gore of land and Dudley. It was &s;urveyed by Mr. Gore of Roxbury, and a return thereof be|ing made to the court, they accepted the &s;ame, and on the 16th of May, 1683, they granted the plantation, and gave it the name of Oxford.</P>
<P>The original proprietors of Oxford, in the year 1686, let on about thirty families of French prot|e&s;tants, who were driven out of France, in con&s;e|quence of the repeal of the edict of Nantz, by Lew|is XIV, in the year 1684. The&s;e unhappy French people, being &s;eated at the ea&s;terly part, or end of Oxford, were grievou&s;ly annoyed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the Indians, and were &s;oon de&s;troyed, or driven away and di&s;per&s;ed by them. Tradition &s;ays, one John&s;on (whether a Frenchman or Engli&s;hman is uncertain) was here killed, and one or two of his children, while his wif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;caped unperceived out of the hou&s;e, at e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ening, with a child in her arms, and walked to Wood&s;tock, about fifteen miles, that night, to a garri&s;on there. At what time this was we cannot preci&s;ely &s;ay. But in the year 1693, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> particular act pa&s;&s;ed, empowering Oxford to &s;end a repre&s;entative to the General Court; as ap|pears by the records in the Secretary's office of this Commonwealth.</P>
<P>As Oxford was then in the county of Suffolk, its fir&s;t and earlier records were kept in Bo&s;ton, and are &s;aid to have been burnt in the Statehou&s;e there.</P>
<P>A deed was given by the original proprietors, or their heirs and executors, to &s;uch as were there, or
<PB N="84" REF="026481_0083_0FD0567C09A99A30">
others, of a part of the original grant, dated July 8th, 1713, that they might &s;ettle and build up the town. The fir&s;t town meeting held in Oxford for the choice of town officers was on the 22d of July, 1713. The people inhabiting this territory were in continual fears from the natives; in con&s;e|quence of which, the &s;ettlement of the town went on but &s;lowly for many years. Except what has been related above, I cannot find that any per&s;ons were killed by the Indians in Oxford. But Gov|ernor Hutchin&s;on gives a piece of hi&s;tory, which mu&s;t not be omitted in this work. It is in the&s;e words. "On the &s;ixth of Augu&s;t, 1724, four In|dians came upon a &s;mall hou&s;e in Oxford, which was built under a hill. They made a breach in the roof, and as one of them was attempting to en|ter, he received a &s;hot in his belly from a coura|geous woman, the only per&s;on in the hou&s;e, who had two mu&s;kets and two pi&s;tols charged, and was prepared for all four, but they thought fit to retreat, carrying off the dead, or wounded man." It is pity the name of this heroine has not been pre&s;erved, that it might be handed down to late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ettlers in Oxford, con&s;idering the then &s;tate of the country, took early care for the enjoy|ment and &s;upport of a preached go&s;pel, and the in|&s;titutions of Chri&s;tianity among them: According|ly the fir&s;t church of Chri&s;t in this place was gath|ered January 18th, 1721, and the Rev. John Campbell was ordained the fir&s;t mini&s;ter, that &s;ame year, viz. March 11th, 1721. This gentle|man
<PB N="85" REF="026481_0084_0FD0567DCCC9F0E8">
came from the north of Scotland; was edu|cated at Edinburgh, and received the honours of that Univer&s;ity. He came into America in the year 1717. He continued the worthy and faithful pa&s;tor of the church and flock here, until May 25th, 1761, when he died in the 71&s;t year of his age, and in the 42d of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Campbell was &s;ucceeded in the &s;acred office by the Rev. Jo&s;eph Bowman, who was in&s;talled here November 14th, 1764. (This Mr. Bowman was fir&s;t ordained at Bo&s;ton, Augu&s;t 31&s;t, 1762, to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, more e&s;|pecially, among the Mohawk Indians on the we&s;t|ern borders of Newengland. He went to Onoho|quague, an Indian town on the Su&s;quehannah, in October following. He returned the la&s;t of May, 1763; but ho&s;tilities commencing between the Indians tribes in June, he did not go back to them; and the war continuing, he was, by the board of commi&s;&s;ioners, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his mi&s;&s;ion in June, 1764.)&mdash;Mr. Bowman lived in great harmony with the people of Oxford until 1775, when the then &s;tate of the country, as to the controver&s;y and war with Greatbritain, occa&s;ioned differences among the people; the&s;e led a number to profe&s;s them&s;elves Quakers, and then they declared them&s;elves to be of the &s;ect, called Univer&s;ali&s;ts, which finally ended in Mr. Bowman's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, at his de&s;ire, with advice of council, Augu&s;t 28th, 1782. After his removal from Oxford, the Rev. Mr. Bowman was in&s;talled at Bernard, in the State of Vermont, September 22, 1784, where he &s;till continues, en|joying

the affection of the people, in a growing, flouri&s;hing town, and ble&s;&s;ed with peace and pro&s;|perity in his latter days.</P>
<P>The Rev. Elias Dudley was ordained &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Mr. Bowman at Oxford, April 13th, 1791.</P>
<P>In the town of Oxford there is a &s;ociety of them who are denominated Univer&s;ali&s;ts, (about a fifth of the inhabitants:) The&s;e, with &s;ome families from &s;everal neighbouring towns, make a re&s;pecta|ble &s;ociety: And they have erected a large elegant meetinghou&s;e, towards the &s;outh end of Oxford plain, where the road from Connecticut inter&s;ects the road from Worce&s;ter to Dudley. This hou&s;e is con&s;tructed upon the mo&s;t modern plan, with a tower and bell. This &s;ociety have not, as yet, any &s;ettled mini&s;ter. There is al&s;o a number in Oxford of the Anabapti&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion; they are de&s;titute of any &s;tated teacher.</P>
<P>We will now give &s;ome Geographical De&s;crip|tion of this town. Oxford, though very exten&s;ive at fir&s;t, has been much curtailed, neverthele&s;s, it is &s;till a large and re&s;pectable town, being about &s;even miles in length from north to &s;outh, and about five miles in width from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The pre&s;ent boundaries of Oxford are as follow; north, it is bounded on Leice&s;ter, Ward, and a country gore of land: Ea&s;t, by Sutton; &s;outh, by a gore of land, and Dudley; and we&s;t, by Charlton. When the late cen&s;us was taken there were 150 hou&s;es, and 1000 inhabitants in the town. The town of Oxford is not very hilly and uneven: In the centre thereof there is a large and fine plain of
<PB N="87" REF="026481_0086_0FD05680886EFF20">
a mile and a half in length, and about a mile in width: This plain is almo&s;t wholly under culti|vation, and is pretty level. On this plain, the road from Worce&s;ter to the ea&s;terly part of Connecticut, and to Rhodei&s;land, runs from the north to the &s;outh: Near the north end of it &s;tands the congregational meetinghou&s;e; and about a mile &s;outh of this is the meetinghou&s;e of the &s;ociety of Univer&s;ali&s;ts: The&s;e hou&s;es are both large and elegant: On ei|ther &s;ide of the &s;treet there are many good build|ings; and almo&s;t the whole plain is under the eye of the traveller at once. From the plain the lands ri&s;e on all &s;ides, e&s;pecially on the ea&s;t and on the we&s;t; but not very high. The &s;oil on the plain is good for grain of all kinds; but not &s;o for pa&s;tur|age or mowing. But the higher lands are very good for mowing, pa&s;turing and orcharding, the &s;oil is &s;trong and fertile. Dudley hills, &s;o called, on the &s;outh, which are pretty high, fall partly with|in the limits of Oxford. About three quarters of a mile we&s;t of the great road on the plain, runs French River from the north to the &s;outh, which falls into the river Quinebaug in the town of Thomp&s;on in the State of Connecticut. This river derived its name from the French prote&s;tants who fir&s;t &s;ettled in Oxford. On this river are &s;ome very good meadows of &s;everal hundreds of acres. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the plain there is a fine &s;tream, which heads in Great Meadow, &s;o called, in the norther|ly part of the town, containing 100 acres, or more. By the &s;ides of this &s;tream there are &s;ome pretty good meadows. This brook empties into French

There are al&s;o, in the town, pora&s;h works. There are two very pretty ponds in the town: One in the we&s;ter|ly part, called Augoot&s;back: The other a little north of the fir&s;t meetinghou&s;e on the Worce&s;ter road, known by the name of <HI>Oxford Pond.</HI> There are &s;ome &s;mall cedar &s;wamps, in this town, which yield cedar for &s;hingles, and other valuable u&s;es. The town is in general well wooded: On the higher lands are oaks of all kinds, walnut and che&s;|nut: On the lower, grow a&s;h, birch, maple, &amp;c. There is &s;ome pitch pine in the town: But not much white pine, at this day, that being chiefly taken off. On the plain, there are two or three &s;tores of European and India goods: And in the town there are all the common artificers, trade&s;|men and mechanics; but the body of the people are farmers. The roads of travel through Ox|ford are an advantage to the town&mdash;the large&s;t road is that which comes from Connecticut through Charlton, Oxford, to Sutton, and &s;o on to Bo&s;ton, falling into the po&s;t road in We&s;ton: The next, is the road from Worce&s;ter, through Oxford, to Dudley, &amp;c. &amp;c. Oxford is &s;ituated to the &s;outh|we&s;t from Bo&s;ton, at the di&s;tance of 54 miles; and from Worce&s;ter courthou&s;e it is 10 miles, nearly &s;outh.</P>

<HEAD>SUTTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS tract of land was originally purcha&s;ed by a number of gentlemen, of Sachem John Wampus, and his company, Indians who claimed it. Wampus fir&s;t re&s;erved four miles &s;quare, for his countrymen the Indians, which they called <HI>Ha&s;&s;anami&s;co</HI>; this is now Grafton. It was to begin at a certain bound, which he fixed upon; and then the purcha&s;ers above referred to, were to have as much land, as eight miles &s;quare would amount to, &s;ituated in the Nipmug country, be|tween the towns of Mendon, Marlborough, Wor|ce&s;ter, Oxford, and New Sherburne (now Doug|la&s;s) and this was confirmed to the purcha&s;ers, May 15th, 1704, and formed into a town&s;hip and called Sutton, by an act of the General Court, dat|ed June 21&s;t, 1715. That part of the original purcha&s;e, which fell to the ea&s;tward of Ha&s;&s;ana|mi&s;co, or Grafton, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> part of it, many years ago annexed to the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f We&s;tborough, and the other part, with &s;ome from M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndon and Hopkinton, taken to form the town of Upton. So that what now is properly Sutton does not lie in a bad form. A few families were annexed to Northbridge, &s;ome years ago: And a few al&s;o, at the northwe&s;t angle of the town, were annexed to Ward. The general boundaries of Sutton, are at pre&s;ent, as follow: North, by Worce&s;ter; ea&s;t and north, by Grafton;

<P>The &s;ettling and peopling of the town was retard|ed for &s;ome time, by re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on of wars with the In|dians. However, in the year 1716, three families had got &s;eated in the place, and wintered there in the winter of 1716 and 1717, when the great &s;now fell, as our fathers have told us. This &s;now fell on &s;ome of the la&s;t days of February, old &s;tile, and came &s;o deep, that it wholly covered over the hut in which one of the families lived. The man being from home, the family might have peri&s;hed had not an Indian, who knew the circum|&s;tances, come to their relief.

This woman is now living, has had four hu&s;bands, and is, at this time, a widow; her name is Cha&s;e.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Sutton fir&s;t acted as a body corporate, or held their fir&s;t town meeting on the 3d day of December, 1718, at the dwelling hou&s;e of Mr. John Stockwell. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was to or|ganize them&s;elves, and to choo&s;e a committee to join the proprietors' committee in order to procure preaching.

<PB N="91" REF="026481_0090_0FD27D9E1408B538">
and ve&s;ted with full town powers and privi|leges: And this was previous to the incorporation of Leice&s;ter or Rutland.</P>
<P>The exact day when the fir&s;t congregational church in Sutton was imbodied cannot be a&s;cer|tained. The record &s;ays, "In the fall of the year 1720." The fir&s;t mini&s;ter, the Rev. John MacKin&s;|try, was ordained November 9th, 1720. He was a gentleman of good abilities and had his education in Scotland. Ob&s;erve, by the way, the early care and pains this people took to have the go&s;pel preached, and a mini&s;ter &s;ettled among them. In about four years from their beginning the &s;ettle|ment of the place, they had a mini&s;ter ordained.</P>
<P>Mr. MacKin&s;try differed &s;o much from the peo|ple in his notions of church government, that they parted: And he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;to|ral relation to them, September 2d, 1728. This gentleman was afterwards re&s;ettled in Connecticut.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mini&s;ter of the town, the Rev. David Hall, was ordained October 15th, 1729. He re|ceived the honourary degree of <HI>Doctor of Divinity,</HI> at Dartmouth college, in the year 1777. After a life of piety and u&s;efulne&s;s, he died May 8th, 1789, in the 85th year of his age, and the 60th year of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Dr. Hall was &s;ucceeded in the &s;acred office by the Rev. Edmund Mills, who was &s;eparated there|unto June 23d, 1790.

<P>The &s;econd pari&s;h in Sutton was incorporated by an act of Court, October 28th, 1743. This is about three miles wide, and &s;ix and one half miles in length; &s;o that the old pari&s;h is much larger. The fir&s;t meeting of the &s;econd pari&s;h was held December 26th, 1743. The &s;econd congregation|al church in the town, was formed by a covenant, dated September 10th, 1747. The Rev. James Welman was con&s;ecrated Pa&s;tor of the &s;econd church October 7th, 1747, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from office July 22d, 1760. The Rev. Mr. Welman was, in 1768, re&s;ettled at Corni&s;h, in the county of Che&s;hire, in the State of Newhamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>Mr. Welman was &s;ucceeded in the pa&s;toral office, in the &s;econd church in Sutton, by the Rev. Eben|ezer Chaplain, who was ordained November 14th, 1764.</P>
<P>There is no record to be found when the fir&s;t Anabapti&s;t &s;ociety was collected in Sutton, nor when Mr. Benjamin Mar&s;h, their fir&s;t elder, was ordained. Tradition &s;ays, it was about the year 1735. They built a &s;mall meetinghou&s;e about a mile we&s;terly from the fir&s;t pari&s;h meetinghou&s;e. After &s;ome years part of Elder Mar&s;h's congrega|tion left him, and joining with new ones, in the year 1767 introduced Mr. Jeremiah Bar&s;tow, as their Elder, and built another Anabapti&s;t meet|inghou&s;e about a mile further we&s;terly, on the road
<PB N="93" REF="026481_0092_0FD27D594414DC60">
towards Oxford. In 1772, the major part of Elder Bar&s;tow's &s;ociety became di&s;&s;atisfied with him; he then, with his adherents, a&s;ked a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the re&s;t, and adjoined to Elder Mar&s;h and the re|mainder of his &s;ociety. In January 1775, Elder Mar&s;h died in the 89th year of his age. Mr. Bar&s;tow kept up a &s;ociety in town, until 1782, when he moved away. In 1783, they introduced Mr. Ebenezer Lam&s;on as their teacher, and who, continuing with them until the fir&s;t of April, 1788, was then ordained their elder. In the &s;outhea&s;t part of the town the people have for &s;everal years heard one Mr. William Batcheldor, who lived among them, and in October, 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he was ordain|ed their elder.</P>
<P>About ten years pa&s;t, the Shakers made con&s;ider|able appearance in the &s;econd pari&s;h, in this town, but have &s;ome time &s;ince, wholly &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>There have al&s;o, for ten or twelve years pa&s;t, been a number of the &s;ect called Univer&s;ali&s;ts, in Sutton; the mo&s;t of them congregate at Oxford; a few at Grafton.

way remarkable. There is a con&s;iderable body of poor land in the &s;outh part of the town; and there is a &s;mall quantity of poor, broken land in the northea&s;t corner of the &s;econd pari&s;h. There is &s;ome good, both high and low interval land, on Black&s;tone River, &s;o called. As this river has its &s;ource in Sutton, and is &s;ingular in its formation and cour&s;e, we &s;hall attempt a particular de&s;crip|tion of it. The reputed head of this river is a pond of about 70 acres, called Ram&s;horn Pond, becau&s;e of the crookedne&s;s of the &s;tream which i&s;&s;ues from it. The pond is &s;ituated about two miles &s;outh|we&s;t from the &s;econd pari&s;h meetinghou&s;e. It has a &s;mall inlet at the &s;outhwe&s;t part; the outlet is at the northea&s;t; and the &s;tream runs northea&s;t until it comes within about half a mile we&s;t of &s;aid meet|inghou&s;e; then bears away northwe&s;t, and runs through Ward, within about half a mile of Ward meetinghou&s;e; takes in &s;everal &s;treams in that town, which have mills on them, particularly one coming from Leice&s;ter, called Kettle Brook; pa&s;&s;es on to Worce&s;ter; and about a mile &s;outherly from the &s;outh meetinghou&s;e, receives Bimilick or Mill Brook, which comes from the North Pond in Wor|ce&s;ter, then turns back, running &s;outhea&s;terly, and comes within half a mile ea&s;t of Sutton &s;econd par|i&s;h meetinghou&s;e; pa&s;&s;es on and takes in the Mill Brook, &s;o called, the outlet of a large pond, called Crooked Pond, lying a little we&s;t of the line be|tween the two meetinghou&s;es in Sutton; and which is about a mile ea&s;t of the little or Ram&s;horn Pond fir&s;t mentioned. The inlet of this pond is on the
<PB N="95" REF="026481_0094_0FD27D5D76F1B838">
&s;outhwe&s;t, the outlet is northea&s;t, has a gri&s;t mill (in the north pari&s;h near the pond) with two run|ners, which, according to the original grant, has the &s;ole command of the water. This pond is &s;uppo&s;ed to be fed chiefly by &s;prings, and is little affected by droughts: Many people from the neighbouring towns bring their grain to this mill, in dry &s;ea&s;ons. On this &s;ame brook, about half a mile below, is Me&s;&s;rs. Burbanks' paper mill. A few rods below, is an oil mill. A few rods below the oil mill, is a fulling mill. A few rods below the fulling mill, in the late war, powder mills were erected, but are &s;ince di&s;continued. A little furth|er down, in the year 1776, a gun manufactory was erected, but is &s;ince converted into a man|ufactory for &s;cythes, axes and mill irons; and here they have trip hammers, bellows, and grind&s;tones, carried by water. Having de&s;cribed this brook, i&s;&s;uing from the pond, and the water works upon it, we return to the river. The river, after it has received this brook, bears away, and runs northea&s;t, and ea&s;t; and takes in a brook from a pond in the northea&s;t part of the &s;econd pari&s;h in Sutton, call|ed <HI>Dorrett</HI>'s <HI>Pond</HI>; having an inlet on the north|we&s;t; the outlet is at the &s;outhea&s;t. Said river then runs ea&s;terly into Grafton, and there receives the &s;tream which i&s;&s;ues from Quin&s;igamond, or Shrew&s;bury Long Pond. The river then bears away, and runs &s;outherly through Northbridge and Uxbridge; and, about a mile &s;outhea&s;t from Uxbridge meetinghou&s;e, takes in a &s;tream which i&s;&s;ues from a pond chiefly in Sutton, near the
<PB N="96" REF="026481_0095_0FD27D63993556B0">
&s;outhwe&s;t corner of the town, called Manchaug Pond. This pond has an inlet on the northwe&s;t; the outlet is to the &s;outhea&s;t, and both in Sutton. This outlet runs along near the &s;outh line of Sut|ton, until it comes to Uxbridge.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the river, and the &s;treams, we would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, this town is famed for its manufactures, its mills, and water works. Here are, one paper mill, one oil mill, ten gri&s;t mills, &s;ix &s;aw mills, three fulling mills, &s;even trip ham|mers, five &s;cythe and ax makers, one hoe maker; &s;everal who work at nail making; and &s;ix works for making of pota&s;h. But here are no mines, no forge, furnace, pearl&s;hery, nor fi&s;h of any con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>There are two or three natural curio&s;ities worthy of particular notice.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, In the we&s;t part of Sutton, within &s;ixty rods of the ri&s;e of the inlet of Ram&s;horn Pond, which is the head of Black&s;tone River running to Providence and falling into the &s;ea at Bri&s;tol, is a brook &s;o large as to carry a &s;aw mill in Sutton, then bears away into Oxford, joins French River, which unites with the river Quinebaug, and enters the &s;ea at Newlondon.</P>
<P>Secondly, A few rods we&s;t of the &s;econd pari&s;h meetinghou&s;e, there is a &s;wamp, having two out|lets; one at the &s;outhwe&s;t; the other at the north|ea&s;t: Both the&s;e outlets enter Black&s;tone River, above de&s;cribed, at about one mile's di&s;tance from each other: But the river is e&s;timated to run ten or twelve miles, after the entrance of that on the
<PB N="97" REF="026481_0096_0FD27D6DCC2204A0">
we&s;terly &s;ide, before it returns and takes in that on the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Thirdly, In the &s;outhea&s;terly part of the town is a cavern in the earth or rocks, commonly called <HI>Purgatory.</HI> The rocks on each &s;ide of the cha&s;m evidently appear to have been rent a&s;under. People may enter &s;ome rods under the ground or rocks, and there are cracks down which they drop pebbles, and after the&s;e &s;trike the &s;ides alternately &s;everal times, they are heard to fall into the water; and a brook i&s;&s;ues out at the bottom of the hill.</P>
<P>It may be acceptable to give a more particular de&s;cription of this place, called Purgatory.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ide of a hill, which con&s;i&s;ts of va&s;t ledg|es of rocks: Where the natural de&s;cent begins, a cha&s;m has been formed of perhaps thirty, and in &s;ome places, forty feet in width, in the&s;e ledges, by &s;ome violent concu&s;&s;ion, which left this body of &s;tones of all &s;hapes and &s;izes, to fall in: A|bove, it is all open to the heavens; and the ledg|es, on either &s;ide, are from five to ten, and &s;o on to twenty, and even forty feet in height. This cha&s;m is, perhaps, near eighty rods in length; and the de&s;cent is gradual, and not very diffi|cult. Where the greate&s;t depth is, water i&s;&s;ues from crevices in the rocks, and hangs in icicles, and even in &s;olid bodies of ice, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only in May, as I have &s;een, but in June, although the de&s;cent is to the &s;outh. Some &s;mall caverns were formed by the falling of the&s;e rocks, through which per&s;ons have de&s;cended, and come out &s;eve|ral rods below. This is a mo&s;t &s;tupendous place,
<PB N="98" REF="026481_0097_0FD27D6F43C09240">
and fills the mind of the beholder with mo&s;t exalt|ed ideas of the infinite power of the great Creator of all things, "who removeth the mountains, and they know not; who &s;haketh the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble." After all, no de&s;cription given of this place, by another, will en|able per&s;ons to form ju&s;t and adequate conceptions of it.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in Sutton, is oak of all &s;orts, and what they call the oak che&s;nut, the bark whereof is like the common gray oak, but the leaves re&s;emble, almo&s;t exactly, tho&s;e of the che&s;nut tree; walnut of all kinds; great plenty of che&s;nut; con|&s;iderable of butternut; but little of buttonwood. In the low lands the wood is a&s;h, beech, birch, elm of all &s;orts, maple, white and pitch pine. They have al&s;o &s;a&s;&s;afras, &s;ar&s;aparilla, and alders. Here are to be found gin&s;eng, and the cohu&s;h root, of &s;pecial medicinal qualities.</P>
<P>There is much travelling through this town. The principal roads are&mdash;one coming from Connecticut, through Oxford, and pa&s;&s;ing from we&s;t to ea&s;t, through the town. About three miles we&s;t of the fir&s;t pari&s;h meetinghou&s;e this road parts; the left hand road pa&s;&s;es by the meetinghou&s;e, and &s;o on through Grafton, We&s;tborough, and Southbor|ough, and leads to Bo&s;ton, falling into the po&s;t road in We&s;ton. The right hand road, at &s;aid parting, pa&s;&s;es on about two miles &s;outh of &s;aid meetinghou&s;e, and enters what is called the middle road in Uxbridge, and &s;o goes on, through Men|don, to Bo&s;ton. Another principal road, is a coun|ty
<PB N="99" REF="026481_0098_0FD27D705836DA40">
road from Worce&s;ter, pa&s;&s;ing from north to &s;outh through the town, by both meetinghou&s;es: At the &s;outh meetinghou&s;e it parts, and, by various part|ings, leads to Dougla&s;s and the we&s;t part of Ux|bridge.</P>
<P>There is another county road, which leads from Uxbridge to Worce&s;ter, through the ea&s;t part of Sutton. This was lately in contemplation to be made the po&s;t road from Worce&s;ter to Providence.</P>
<P>The town of Sutton is di&s;tant from the State|hou&s;e in Bo&s;ton 46 miles to the &s;outhwe&s;t. And from Worce&s;ter courthou&s;e, it is &s;ix miles to the north pari&s;h meetinghou&s;e; and to the &s;outh pari&s;h meetinghou&s;e, to the &s;outh nine miles.</P>
<P>This is a large and flouri&s;hing town, the &s;econd in wealth in the county; and when the cen&s;us was taken in 1791, there were 2642 inhabitants there|in.</P>

<P>THE town&s;hip of Leice&s;ter was grant|ed by the General Court, on the tenth of Februa|ry, 1713, to Col. Jo&s;hua Lamb, of Roxbury, and others, his a&s;&s;ociates; and on the fifteenth day of the &s;ame month and year, the Court, by a particu|lar re&s;olve or act, gave this tract of land the name of Leice&s;ter.

and by the Engli&s;h it was u&s;ually called <HI>Strawber|ry Hill.</HI> The place was not incorporated, and ve&s;ted with town powers and privileges, until the clo&s;e of the year 1720, or the beginning of the year 1721: For the fir&s;t town meeting held in Leice&s;ter was on the &s;ixth of March, 172<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. A &s;ur|vey of this grant being ordered, and a return there|of made, the General Court e&s;tabli&s;hed the lines and boundaries of it by a &s;pecial act, on the 19th of January, 1714. The tract was to be eight miles &s;quare; and was granted on the&s;e conditions, that the proprietors &s;hould re&s;erve a &s;ufficient quantity of land for the u&s;e of the mini&s;try and &s;chools, and &s;ee that fifty families were &s;ettled thereon in &s;even years. The proprietors accordingly, at a meeting in Bo&s;ton, on the 23d of February, 1713, voted to give one half of the town&s;hip to fifty families who &s;hould &s;ettle thereon, in that &s;pace of time. That number of families hav|ing removed to, and &s;ettled at Leice&s;ter, the propri|etors, at a meeting held at Bo&s;ton, on the 23d of July, 1722, cho&s;e a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of Wil|liam Dudley and Jo&s;hua Lamb, E&s;qrs; Mr. Nathan|iel Kenny, Mr. Samuel Tyler, and Mr. Samuel Green, to make and execute a deed of the ea&s;terly half of Leice&s;ter, lying we&s;t of and adjoining to Worce&s;ter; ea&s;t of Brookfield, &s;outh of Rutland, and north of a gore of land lying between Oxford and Leice&s;ter, to Mr. John Stebbins, and others; which deed bears date January 8th, 1724; and was recorded November 26th, 1729, Libro 29th, page 329 of the records of the county of Middle|&s;ex.

This grant was intended to be eight miles &s;quare: But the mea&s;ure was large, and included the whole of what is now Spencer: And at the north end, two miles in width and four in length were taken off to help form the town of Paxtor in 1765: And at the &s;outhea&s;t part of the town, about 2500 acres were taken off to aid in making up the town of Ward, in 1778. Leice&s;ter is &s;till a very con&s;iderable town, and contained when the enume|ration was made, nearly 1100 inhabitants.&mdash;It is bounded on the north by Paxton; on the ea&s;t by Worce&s;ter and Ward; on the &s;outh by Oxford; and on the we&s;t by Spencer.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ettlers of Leice&s;ter, like the people in general, of that day, paid early attention to relig|ion, to the &s;upport of the go&s;pel, and the in&s;titu|tions of Chri&s;t among them. When the congre|gational church in this place was gathered, cannot now be exactly a&s;certained, as there were no church records kept or pre&s;erved, till within about 40 years. But the probability is this, that the church was formed at the time of the fir&s;t mini&s;ter's being &s;ettled with them, who was the Rev. David Par|&s;ons. This Mr. Par&s;ons was ordained at Malden, near Bo&s;ton, but &s;oon removed with a con&s;iderable part of his people, to Leice&s;ter, where he was in|&s;talled, by the be&s;t account to be now had, Septem|ber 15th, 1721. He did not continue long in the mini&s;try at Leice&s;ter, but was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;toral relation to that flock, and died in about two years after. He was &s;ucceeded in the &s;acred office, at Leice&s;ter, by the Rev. David Goddard,

who was &s;olemnly con&s;ecrated thereto June 30th, 1736. He was not &s;uffered to continue long with this people, by rea&s;on of death; for being on a journey, at Framingham, he was there &s;eized with a fever which put a period to his days January 19th, 1754, in the 48th year of his age, and the 13th of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Rev. Jo&s;eph Roberts &s;ucceeded Mr. God|dard in the mini&s;try at Leice&s;ter, whereunto he was ordained October 23d, 1754, and he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed therefrom December 15th, 1762. To him &s;uc|ceeded in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, the Rev. Benjamin Conklin, who was &s;eparated thereunto on the 23d of November, 1763, and &s;till continues in office.</P>
<P>There is a con&s;iderable &s;ociety of Anabapti&s;ts in Leice&s;ter, and which has been of long &s;tanding. Their fir&s;t teacher was Mr. Thomas Green, a phy|&s;ician. After his death, the Rev. Benjamin Fo&s;ter, A. M. was ordained among them; but for want of &s;upport he removed, and has been re&s;ettled in the city of Newyork; where he is a worthy mini&s;|ter, and has lately received the degree of Doctor of Divinity. The Anabapti&s;t &s;ociety in Leice&s;ter, have for their pre&s;ent teacher Mr. Nathan Dana. Their hou&s;e of wor&s;hip is in the &s;outh part of the town.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, there is in Leice&s;ter, a number of the peo|ple called Friends, or Quakers, who have a very good hou&s;e for their way of wor&s;hip, erected in the north part of the town in the year 1791.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides the above funds for the &s;upport of In|&s;tructors for this academy, the General Court grant|ed in 1792, a town&s;hip of land, in the di&s;trict of of Maine, of &s;ix miles &s;quare to the u&s;e of this academy.

<P>Some Topographical De&s;cription of this town &s;hall now be attempted.</P>
<P>Leice&s;ter is &s;ituated upon the height of land between the Atlantick Ocean, ea&s;t and &s;outh, and Connecticut River on the we&s;t. The town is very hilly and uneven; it is indeed famed for its
<PB N="106" REF="026481_0105_0FD27D855CA1C1F8">
hills, but the&s;e are moi&s;t, &s;pringy and rocky yet not exceedingly &s;o. The &s;oil is pretty good, deep and &s;trong, but rather cold clayey and wet, not &s;o well adapted to grain as to gra&s;s and pa&s;tur|age: It is pretty good for orcharding and fruit trees of all kinds.</P>
<P>There are divers hills of note and fame in the town; the fir&s;t we &s;hall mention, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, is Strawberry Hill, &s;o called by the Engli&s;h when they fir&s;t came there, in con&s;equence of the exuberant growth of tho&s;e berries. On this hill &s;tands their elegant new meetinghou&s;e, on the northwe&s;t &s;ide of the common which is level, fac|ing to the &s;outhea&s;t, erected in 1784. At the northea&s;t angle of the &s;quare &s;tands the academy buildings; the other &s;ides of the &s;quare are lined with large hand&s;ome dwelling hou&s;es. This hill is high and rather &s;teep, but not large and exten|&s;ive. A &s;econd hill is called <HI>Indian Hill,</HI> or <HI>Bald Hill,</HI> on account of its being cleared and planted with corn by the Indians, a long time before the white people went up &s;o far to live. A third is called <HI>Moo&s;e Hill,</HI> becau&s;e of the great number of tho&s;e quadrupeds which were wont to harbour there. Another is called <HI>Cary's Hill,</HI> from one of that name who went thither and digged a cave in the &s;ide of this hill, and lived there as an hermit many years, while that part of the country was in its wilderne&s;s &s;tate. A fifth is known by the name of <HI>Gra&s;s Hill.</HI></P>
<P>Although there is no river running through the town, yet it is well watered by &s;prings and rivulets,

<P>From the foregoing &s;tatement, it appears that the whole grant of 12 miles &s;quare was named Rut|land, in 1713; but that only the &s;ix miles &s;quare granted by the proprietors to the &s;ettlers, was call|ed Rutland, and incorporated as a town; and that this was not done until the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the General Court which was begun May 30, 1722. And in con&s;equence of the above recited act, an order of the General Court pa&s;&s;ed July 6th, 1722, author|izing and empowering Capt. Samuel Wright to call a meeting of the freeholders and other inhabi|tants of the town of Rutland, on the la&s;t Monday of July current, then to choo&s;e town officers to &s;erve until the general meeting in March next. The town was notified and met accordingly; and this was the fir&s;t legal town meeting ever held in Rutland.</P>
<P>After the &s;ettlers had performed their conditions, and the &s;ix miles &s;quare was incorporated, we find the proprietors of the town&s;hip of Rutland, in all
<PB N="115" REF="026481_0114_0FD27D52531C78A8">
future meetings, had nothing to do with &s;aid &s;ix miles &s;quare, which is now the town of Rutland; but concerned them&s;elves only with the other parts of their original grant, we &s;hall therefore leave them, and confine our&s;elves to the account of Rut|land.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid, the &s;ettlers of the &s;ix miles &s;quare, on the 12th of July 1721, invited the Rev. Jo&s;eph Willard to &s;ettle with them in the work of the min|i&s;try, which invitation he accepted. This Mr. Willard had been ordained a mini&s;ter of Sunder|land in the county of Hamp&s;hire, but continued a very little time with them before he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. After he had accepted the invitation to &s;ettle with the people of Rutland, he met with many and great di&s;couragements, and particularly by rea&s;on of the fears and dangers ari&s;ing from the Indians; &s;o that an appointment of his in&s;tallation was deferred. However, at length a day was fixed upon for his &s;olemn &s;eparation to the work of the mini&s;try in that place, in the fall of the year 1723; but he lived not to &s;ee the day, being cut off by the ene|my, as &s;hall be now related. As Deacon Jo&s;eph Stevens and four of his &s;ons were making hay in a meadow, at Rutland, a little north of the place where the meetinghou&s;e now &s;tands, Augu&s;t 14th, 1723, they were &s;urpri&s;ed by five Indians. The father e&s;caped in the bu&s;hes; two of his &s;ons were then and there &s;lain; the other two, (Phinehas the elde&s;t, and I&s;aac the younge&s;t) were made pri&s;on|ers. Two of the five Indians waylaid a Mr. Davis and &s;on, who that afternoon were making hay in
<PB N="116" REF="026481_0115_0FD27DA0053D6288">
a meadow not far off, but weary of waiting they were returning to the others, and met Mr. Willard in their way, who was armed: One of the Indians' guns mi&s;&s;ed fire, the others did no execution. Mr. Willard returned the fire, and wounded one of them, it is &s;aid mortally, the other clo&s;ed in with Mr. Willard; but he would have been more than a match for him, had not the other three come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: And it was &s;ome con&s;iderable time before they killed Mr. Willard. This account Phinehas Stevens gave upon his return from cap|tivity, who was a &s;pectator of &s;ome part of the tragedy. The Indians having killed and &s;calped Mr. Willard, and taken &s;ome of his clothes, went off to Canada with the two captives above named. They were redeemed in about a year. Phinehas Stevens was a famous warrior, a captain, and a principal man in building up and defending the then young plantation No. 4, now Charle&s;town, in Newhamp&s;hire &s;tate. I&s;aac Stevens lived at Rutland. They have both been dead many years. On the 3d of Augu&s;t 1724, the Indians came again upon Rutland, killed three per&s;ons, wound|ed one, and made another pri&s;oner. This is as I find it related in Governor Hutchin&s;on's hi&s;tory. Others &s;peak of but two killed: But the names of the killed, wounded, or pri&s;oner, cannot now be a&s;certained. This was the la&s;t mi&s;chief done at Rutland by the Indians, &s;o far as we can learn.</P>
<P>The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of Rutland is brief and as here follows. The church of Chri&s;t in the town was gathered November 1&s;t, 1727, and on
<PB N="117" REF="026481_0116_0FD27DA5F59748B8">
the &s;ame day the Rev. Thomas Frink was ordain|ed their fir&s;t Pa&s;tor. Mr. Frink continued but a little time as their mini&s;ter, being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office September 8th, 1740. (Mr. Frink was in&s;talled Pa&s;tor of the third church in Plymouth, November 7th, 1743, where he continued mini&s;ter but a &s;hort &s;pace; being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from thence, he was in&s;talled at Barre on the la&s;t Wedne&s;day in October 1753; from whence al&s;o he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed July 17th, 1766.) The Rev. Jo&s;eph Buckmin&s;ter &s;ucceeded Mr. Frink, as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, at Rutland, whereunto he was ordained September 15th, 1742. Mr. Buckmin&s;ter continu|ed the able faithful and worthy mini&s;ter of Rut|land until November 3d, 1792, when he died in the 73d year of his age, and the 51&s;t of his mini&s;|try. He was &s;ucceeded in about eight months, by the Rev. Hezekiah Goodrich, who was &s;eparated to the pa&s;toral office in Rutland, on the 19th of June 1793.</P>
<P>In this town upwards of forty per&s;ons have late|ly united, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ocial Library, of the value of nearly 30<HI>l.</HI> and containing about 70 vol|umes at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Some Geographical De&s;cription of Rutland &s;hall now be attempted.</P>
<P>The town is &s;ituated on the height of land be|tween the &s;ea and Connecticut River: It is hilly and very uneven: The hill on which the meeting|hou&s;e &s;tands is high: And the meetinghou&s;e may be &s;een in many of the adjacent towns, and even at a great di&s;tance to the we&s;t and northwe&s;t; but
<PB N="118" REF="026481_0117_0FD27DA9E0F652F0">
as the town abounds with hills it affords no exten|&s;ive and commanding pro&s;pect of it&s;elf. Ea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e is a hill called Mu&s;chapauge hill or Rice's hill, containing two or three hundred acres, this is very good land, and has &s;ome fine farms upon it. Part of Turkey Hill, &s;o called, on the &s;outh falls within Rutland, the re&s;t is in Paxton. This is high, but mo&s;t excellent land.</P>
<P>Other hills there are many, but none particular|ly noticeable. The land in general is very good, and the &s;oil is rich and &s;trong: It is not extraordi|nary for rai&s;ing of grain, though a &s;ufficiency is produced for the inhabitants; it is very well adapted to gra&s;s and grazing, and mo&s;t excellent for orcharding: Here are large and fine orchards, and much cyder is made in the town.</P>
<P>Rutland, being the height of land, has no large rivers running through it. Pi&s;s River, &s;o called, which originates on the we&s;t &s;ide of Watchu&s;ett Hill, runs through Hubbard&s;ton, and pa&s;&s;es acro&s;s the northwe&s;t angle of this town, and &s;o falls into Ware river. On this river are one corn mill, two &s;aw mills, one fulling mill, and one trip hammer, within the limits of Rutland; and the meadows on this river are con&s;iderable. There is a large &s;tream, called Long Meadow Brook, running through the town, in the we&s;terly part thereof, on which are large meadows, and two corn mills and two &s;aw mills within the bounds of this town. About half a mile ea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e is a famous &s;pring, the waters whereof &s;oon divide; part runs to Merimack and part to Connecticut

River: And it is to be ob&s;erved that all the waters of Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">land run to the&s;e two great rivers. There are divers pond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the town; Mu&s;copauge Pond, mentioned in the Indian deed; this is large, cover|ing about 100 acres. In this pond two per&s;ons have been drowned. Evans's Pond, &s;o called, of about 60 or 70 acres, in the &s;outhwe&s;terly part of the town. Al&s;o, Gregory's or Long Pond, which is long and narrow, in the &s;outhwe&s;terly quarter. The&s;e are all well &s;tored with fi&s;h. Browning's Pond is large, this is &s;ituated in the &s;outherly part, and is partly in Rutland, partly in Spencer; but the large&s;t part is in Oakham. The growth of wood in Rutland is, oak of all &s;orts, che&s;nut, wal|nut, pine of all &s;orts, a&s;h, maple, birch, beach, poplar, elm, &s;a&s;&s;afras, hemlock, hackmatack, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the we&s;terly and northwe&s;terly part of the town is an exten&s;ive plain, a great part of which is &s;till covered with pitch pine. This is rather light land. The people of Rutland are principally farmers, except a few traders in European, Ea&s;t and We&s;tindia goods, the u&s;ual mechanicks, and tho&s;e employed in the card making bu&s;ine&s;s, which is newly &s;et up here: And they are a peaceable, happy, flouri&s;hing people. In this town, pot and pearl a&s;h making is carried on very largely. When the cen&s;us was taken about two years ago there were 1072 &s;ouls in the town.</P>
<P>Rutland is bounded, on the north by Hubbard&s;|ton; on the northea&s;t, by Princeton; on the ea&s;t, by Holden; on the &s;outh, by Paxton; on the we&s;t, by Oakham; and on the northwe&s;t, by Bar|re.

<P>THIS town was taken from Marl|borough, and lying the whole length of that town on the we&s;t &s;ide, thence was called We&s;tborough when incorporated by act of the General Court on the 18th of November 1717.

on the we&s;t, about 40 miles di&s;tant, did not &s;ettle &s;o fa&s;t: Neverthele&s;s, towards the clo&s;e of the &s;eventeenth century &s;everal families had here &s;eated them&s;elves; and among others, Me&s;&s;rs. Thomas and Edmund Rice had families, and were fixed down but a little we&s;t of where the pre&s;ent meetinghou&s;e in We&s;tborough &s;tands. On Augu&s;t 8th, 1704, as &s;everal per&s;ons were bu&s;y in &s;pread|ing flax, on a plain about eighty rods from the hou&s;e of Mr. Thomas Rice (the fir&s;t &s;ettler in We&s;tbor|ough, and &s;everal years repre&s;entative of the town of Marlborough, in the General Court) and a num|ber of boys with them, &s;even, &s;ome &s;ay ten, Indians &s;uddenly ru&s;hed down a woody hill near by, and, knocking the lea&s;t of the boys on the head (Nahor, about five years old, &s;on of Mr. Edmund Rice, and the fir&s;t Engli&s;h per&s;on ever buried in We&s;t|borough) they &s;eized two, A&s;her and Adonijah, &s;ons of Mr. Thomas Rice, the olde&s;t about ten, and the other about eight years of age, and two others, Silas and Timothy, &s;ons of Mr. Edmund Rice abovenamed, of about nine and &s;even years of age, and carried them away to Canada. The per&s;ons who were &s;preading flax, e&s;caped &s;afely to the hou&s;e. A&s;her, in about four years, returned, being redeemed by his father. This was effected by the kind mediation of the Rev. Mr. Lydius, then mini&s;ter of Albany. And here, by the way, it &s;hould be noted, that when the old Indian Sa|chem <HI>Ounta&s;&s;ogo,</HI> the chief of the Cagnawagas, at the conference with Governor Belcher at Deerfield, made a vi&s;it to Bo&s;ton, he &s;topped awhile in We&s;t|borough;

the beforementioned A&s;her Rice &s;aw and knew him to be one of the Indians who ru&s;hed down the hill, as above related, when he was taken by them. This Mr. A&s;her Rice married, had a family, and was living but a few years pa&s;t in Spencer. His brother Adonijah, grew up in Canada, and married there, fir&s;t a French, after|wards a Dutch woman, and followed the bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry on &s;ome land a little way off from <HI>Montreal,</HI> on the north &s;ide of the great river St. Lawrence, and had a good farm there, as we have been certified.

<P>As to the other two, Silas and Timothy, they mixed with the Indians; lo&s;t their mother tongue, had Indian wives, and children by them; and liv|ed at <HI>Cagnawaga.</HI> The name by which Silas was di&s;tingui&s;hed among the Indians was <HI>Tookanowras.</HI></P>
<P>Timothy, the younge&s;t, however, was much the mo&s;t noticeable per&s;on. The accounts received from thence, have uniformly repre&s;ented him as the third of the &s;ix chiefs of the <HI>Cagnawagas.</HI> This advancement was in con&s;equence of the death of his fo&s;ter father, or ma&s;ter, who had adopted him for a &s;on, in&s;tead of a &s;on which he, the former chief, had lo&s;t. "However,) &s;aid the Rev.

<P>The venerable Mr. Parkman, in a manu&s;cript account of the&s;e per&s;ons found among his papers &s;ince his death, adds, with re&s;pect to this Timothy, in the&s;e words: "He him&s;elf, in proce&s;s of time, came to &s;ee us. By the interpo&s;ition of Col.

This propo&s;al was readily complied with, and it &s;uc|ceeded.</P>
<P>The chief above&s;aid came, and the &s;aid Mr. Tarbell with him as interpreter and companion. They arrived here September 15th. They viewed the hou&s;e where Mr. Rice dwelt, and the place from whence the children were captivated; of both which he retained a clear remembrance; as he did likewi&s;e of &s;everal elderly per&s;ons who were then living; though he had forgot our language. His Excellency Governor Belcher &s;ent for them, who, accordingly, waited on him at Bo&s;ton.

<P>To the above account I would add, there are at this pre&s;ent time, 1/93, a brother and &s;i&s;ter of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bovenamed Silas and Timothy, living in North|borough, in a very advanced age, though not born when their brethren were captivated, who have heard that the&s;e men were living in Canada, in the &s;ummer of 1790.</P>
<P>Let us proceed to &s;ome Geographical De&s;crip|tion of We&s;tborough. The town is pretty large, and very generally &s;ettled, containing, when the cen&s;us was taken in 1791, hou&s;es 118, and inhab|itants 934. It is about 34 miles from Bo&s;ton, a little to the &s;outh of we&s;t, and 13 miles ea&s;t from Worce&s;ter. The middle of the town is level, but the lands ri&s;e, at about a mile's di&s;tance from the meetinghou&s;e into higher, e&s;pecially to the ea&s;t, &s;outh and we&s;t. The &s;oil is in general good, the farms are large, and the inhabitants indu&s;trious and wealthy, as any one mu&s;t naturally &s;uppo&s;e from the appearance of their places and buildings. The growth of wood here is &s;imilar to that in the neighbouring towns: The higher lands bear plen|ty of oak and che&s;nut, &s;ome walnut; in the &s;wamps and low lands grow a&s;h, birch and maple: Here al&s;o they have large and excellent cedar &s;wamps, which afford the people much cedar for &s;hingles and oth|er important and nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es: There is, at this day, but little white pine, but con&s;iderable pitch
<PB N="125" REF="026481_0124_0FD27DB9A4E23AF0">
pine. There is very little broken poor land in the town; neither is it very rocky; but bears all kinds of grain in plenty; it is good for orchard|ing, gra&s;s and pa&s;turing: It is very well watered by &s;mall &s;treams and rivulets, on which they have mills; and on the&s;e they have con&s;iderable bodies of good meadow land. The river A&s;&s;abet, run|ning through the northwe&s;t angle of the town, has upon its banks a very large body of very excellent meadow or interval.</P>
<P>Ponds there are &s;everal in the town, as Great Chauncy in the northea&s;terly part, into which a rivulet enters at the &s;outh end from &s;wamps and low lands; this is a fine pond, and here is a plen|ty of fi&s;h. A &s;mall &s;tream i&s;&s;ues from the north end of this pond and empties into Little Chauncy, which is in Northborough.</P>
<P>About a mile &s;outh of Great Chauncy, there is a &s;mall pond, near the road from We&s;tborough to Bo&s;ton, whence i&s;&s;ues a &s;mall &s;tream to the &s;outh, entering a large cedar &s;wamp, and running through that, empties into a large pond called Cedar Swamp Pond, which is environed on the ea&s;t, north and we&s;t, with &s;aid &s;wamp; from this pond, on the &s;outh, there is an outlet which runs into Hopkin|ton, and aids in forming Sudbury, or Concord South River. It is worthy of notice, that the wa|ters in this town, though they take different routs, finally unite in Concord, by the confluence of the north and &s;outh river in that town. In the north|we&s;terly part of We&s;tborough is &s;ituated Hobomo|cho Pond, not large, encircled with a meadow,
<PB N="126" REF="026481_0125_0FD27EAFE77593E8">
bearing the &s;ame name, and from this there is an outlet into the River A&s;&s;abet, abovementioned.</P>
<P>We&s;tborough is bounded on the ea&s;t, by South|borough and Hopkinton; on the &s;outh, by Upton; on the we&s;t, by Grafton and Shrew&s;bury; and on the north, by Northborough.</P>

<HEAD>UXBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Uxbridge was taken from the ancient town of Mendon, and was incor|porated by an act of the Legi&s;lature, on the 27th of June 1727, and then received its pre&s;ent name. It was the we&s;terly part of that town. It was large at fir&s;t, extending ten or twelve miles from north to &s;outh; but has &s;ince been curtailed, having the north part &s;et off in 1772, and made a di&s;tinct town, by the name of Northbridge.</P>
<P>Uxbridge &s;till remains a very con&s;iderable town in extent, and for the number of its inhabitants. When the cen&s;us was taken in 1791, there were 180 dwelling hou&s;es, and 1310 inhabitants in the place.</P>
<P>The people took early care for the &s;upport of the go&s;pel, and the in&s;titutions of Chri&s;tianity a|mong them; accordingly, &s;oon after the incorpo|ration of the town, viz. on the &s;ixth of January 1731, a church of Chri&s;t was here gathered under
<PB N="127" REF="026481_0126_0FD27EB1EC5DE900">
the direction of the Rev. Jo&s;eph Dorr of Mendon: and on February third, 1731, the Rev. Nathan Webb, was inve&s;ted with the pa&s;toral office in the place. Mr. Webb continued the faithful mini&s;ter of the town upwards of 41 years; being removed by death on the 14th of March 1772. The Rev. Hezekiah Chapman &s;ucceeded Mr. Webb in the work of the mini&s;try in Uxbridge; whereunto he was &s;olemnly &s;eparated January 27th, 1774; and from which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed April 5th, 1781. The Rev. Jo&s;iah Spalding, &s;ucceeded Mr. Chap|man as mini&s;ter of Uxbridge, being ordained on the 11th of September 1783: He continued with this people but about four years, being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;toral relation to them, October 23d, 1787. The&s;e two gentlemen were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed more on account of the peculiarity of their religious &s;enti|ments, than any thing be&s;ide. Mr. Spalding has &s;ince been in&s;talled at Worthington in the county of Hamp&s;hire. On the 17th of October 1792, the Rev. Samuel Jud&s;on was ordained Pa&s;tor, the fourth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of the congregational &s;ociety in Uxbridge.</P>
<P>In the town of Uxbridge there are a few fam|ilies of the Anabapti&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion. And here al&s;o is a very con&s;iderable &s;ociety, nearly one quarter of the inhabitants of the town, of the &s;ect called Friends, who have a meetinghou&s;e for the wor&s;hip of God in their way, built with brick.</P>
<P>We will now give &s;ome Geographical De&s;crip|tion of the town of Uxbridge.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="026481_0127_0FD27EB2EE399670">This town is &s;ituated at the &s;outhern extremity of the county, and is bounded on the &s;outh, by the line between this Commonwealth, and the &s;tate of Rhodei&s;land; on the we&s;t, by Dougla&s;s; on the north, by Northbridge; and on the ea&s;t, by Men|don.</P>
<P>Uxbridge is 42 miles from Bo&s;ton, &s;omewhat to the &s;outhwe&s;t, and is 18 miles from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, to the &s;outhea&s;t.</P>
<P>The land in the town is pretty level, for the &s;pace of about one mile round the meetinghou&s;e, being a plain, and rather &s;andy and light; how|ever, good for rai&s;ing of grain of all &s;orts; then it ri&s;es to hills on all &s;ides, but not very high, nor very rocky; the&s;e are moi&s;t and good for orchard|ing, and for grazing, and for Engli&s;h gra&s;s: There is a good proportion of interval and meadow lands upon the rivers, which are in general very good. There are three rivers in this town, all of them unite in the &s;outh part; Black&s;tone, Mumford, and We&s;t River. Black&s;tone River has its &s;ource in Sutton; and was particularly de&s;cribed in the ac|count of that town. This river comes from Sutton through Grafton and Northbridge, and enters Ux|bridge at the north end of the town, and running through the town, near the middle, pa&s;&s;es into Rhodei&s;land State: This is a large and fine river. Mumford River has its ri&s;e in Rocky Woods, &s;o called, in Dougla&s;s, being increa&s;ed by &s;treams from Badluck Pond, and from Manchaug Pond, in Dougla&s;s, and by &s;prings and rivulets, and runs an ea&s;terly cour&s;e into Uxbridge, then turns and
<PB N="129" REF="026481_0128_0FD27EBA6E2FBEE8">
runs &s;outhea&s;terly within a few rods of Uxbridge meetinghou&s;e, where there are &s;everal &s;orts of mills and water works, in excellent order, and where much bu&s;ine&s;s is well performed. This river con|tinues its cour&s;e, and joins Black&s;tone River about one mile &s;outhea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e.</P>
<P>We&s;t River is not large, its main &s;ource is a pond in the northerly part of Upton, and running through a part of Northbridge, it pa&s;&s;es through the ea&s;terly &s;ide of Uxbridge, and falls into Black|&s;tone River about two miles &s;outhea&s;t from the meetinghou&s;e. Be&s;ides the&s;e rivers, there are divers brooks and rivulets, by which this town is finely watered. There are al&s;o three &s;mall ponds in the town, covering ten or twelve acres of land each, and are called, Pout Pond, Mud Pond, and Shoelog Pond. Pout Pond is in the ea&s;t part of the town, about one mile from the meetinghou&s;e. Mud Pond is &s;ituated in the &s;outhea&s;t part of the town, not far from Black&s;tone River, with which it holds a com|munication when the water is high. Shoelog Pond is &s;ituated in the &s;outhwe&s;t part of the town, from whence i&s;&s;ues a &s;mall &s;tream, which runs into Glouce&s;ter, in the State of Rhodei&s;land. Not far from this pond an iron mine has been di&s;covered, and wherein per&s;ons have wrought to very con&s;id|erable advantage. Upon the farm of Dr. Samuel Willard, in Uxbridge, there is a fine quarry of &s;tone, of a greyi&s;h colour, ea&s;ily &s;plit, and wrought into any &s;hape for underpinning, door &s;tones, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="026481_0129_0FD27EBBE879DCB8">The growth of wood and timber in this town is pretty much like that of other towns in general: Oak of various &s;orts, &s;ome che&s;nut, walnut, poplar and pine.</P>
<P>The people of Uxbridge &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by the cultivation of the &s;oil: They have, however, all the common &s;orts of mechanicks, and a few dealers in European, Ea&s;t and We&s;t India goods.</P>
<P>There is one road of con&s;iderable travel, from Connecticut, directly through this town to Men|don, and &s;o on to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>This may be con&s;idered as a large, wealthy, flouri&s;hing place, and &s;tands forward in the li&s;t of towns, according to the proportion which it pays to a State tax.</P>

<HEAD>SOUTHBOROUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Southborough, was taken from the ancient town of Marlborough, and derived its name from the circum&s;tance of its lying about &s;outh from that town. It was incorporated, by act of Court, July 6th, 1727. A few years pa&s;t, a &s;trip of land, belonging to Framingham, of about three hundred acres, and running up between Southborough and Hopkinton, was annexed to Southborough.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="026481_0130_0FD27EBD66F534A0">The church of Chri&s;t in this town, was embodied on the 24th of October 1730, and on the &s;ame day the Rev. Nathan Stone was ordained their fir&s;t Pa&s;tor: He was a judicious, prudent, and faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and was continued &s;erving God in the go&s;pel of his Son, to the great &s;atisfaction of his people, until May 31&s;t, 1781, when he depart|ed this life, in the 74th year of his age and 51&s;t of his mini&s;try. The people were de&s;titute of a &s;ettled mini&s;ter for the long &s;pace of ten years, even until June 1&s;t, 1791, when the Rev. Samuel Sumner was &s;olemnly &s;eparated unto the pa&s;toral office over the church and flock of God in Southborough.</P>
<P>We &s;hall proceed to give &s;ome Geographical De&s;cription of this town. It is &s;ituated on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the county, and is bounded by Marl|borough on the north, Framingham on the ea&s;t, Hopkinton on the &s;outh, and We&s;tborough and Northborough on the we&s;t: It is 29 miles from Bo&s;ton, a little to the &s;outh of we&s;t; and 17 miles from Worce&s;ter courthou&s;e, about ea&s;t. It is not large in extent, but pretty well filled with people, who are generally good and wealthy farmers. They have about 120 dwelling hou&s;es, 150 families, and 840 inhabitants. The town is not level, nor yet very uneven; there are no exten&s;ive plains, and no very high hills; the &s;oil is &s;trong, good and rich, and productive, amply repaying for its cultivation. It is not very rocky, however, there is a &s;ufficiency of &s;tone, perhaps on every farm, whereby it is, or may be walled in. In the South part of the town there is a hill, which, from the &s;teepne&s;s of its a&s;|cent,
<PB N="132" REF="026481_0131_0FD27EBEDD20AA40">
is called Breakneck Hill, over the &s;teepe&s;t part runs a town road; it is rocky and rough, but cov|ered with a large growth of young wood, and de|&s;cends to the north. In the northea&s;t part is &s;itu|ated what is called Pine Hill, which was covered with pines and timber until the year 1787, when, by a hurricane, the wood was chiefly de&s;troyed. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the town there is a &s;teep hill over which the county road lies, but not di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by any particular name.</P>
<P>The town is well watered by &s;treams and rivu|lets. Stony Brook ri&s;es in the ea&s;terly part of We&s;tborough, runs through Southborough in a cour&s;e which in general is ea&s;terly; but not with|out &s;everal great angles; for what is worthy of re|mark, the road through the town to Bo&s;ton cro&s;&s;es this &s;tream three times within the &s;pace of four miles. This &s;tream enters Framingham and there falls into Sudbury River. On this &s;tream are two &s;aw mills, in fine order, of profit to their owners, and benefit to the town. Upon the &s;ame brook are four corn mills. One in the we&s;terly part of the town, neare&s;t its &s;ource, and on the great road, can grind but about half the year, as rai&s;ing a pond in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on would damage a large body of meadow land. But below this, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles, as the &s;tream runs, &s;tands another mill in good repair, and where much bu&s;i|ne&s;s is done, not only for the benefit of this, but the neighbouring towns. About two miles further down this &s;tream, are two well con&s;tructed corn mills, the property of Col. Thomas Nixon, which
<PB N="133" REF="026481_0132_0FD27EC35691E4A0">
grind all the year, except in a very dry &s;ea&s;on, as the waters of Angle Brook, and Broad Meadow Brook fall into this &s;tream above the&s;e mills. On this Stony Brook, clothiers' works have lately been erected in the ea&s;terly part of the town where much bu&s;ine&s;s is well performed.</P>
<P>A &s;econd &s;tream is called Angle Brook, from its winding cour&s;e. One branch of this &s;tream ri&s;es near the meetinghou&s;e in Marlborough, and anoth|er branch a little further &s;outh, and &s;oon uniting enters Southborough, and there joining with Broad Meadow Brook, in about the di&s;tance of a mile, falls into Stony Brook, as abovementioned. There are many other &s;treams le&s;s noticeable. But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve what is called Sudbury River, i&s;&s;ues from Cedar Swamp Pond, in the &s;outhea&s;terly part of We&s;tborough, and when it leaves that town, is the boundary between Southborough and Hopkin|ton, on the &s;outh. The meadows on this river, in Southborough, are narrow, but produce large quan|tities of good &s;tock hay, being a mixture of meadow, and Engli&s;h gra&s;s. Tho&s;e upon Stony and An|gle Brooks are good, and yield mo&s;t excellent bank hay. There is but one pond in this town, in the we&s;tern part, &s;mall, covering perhaps &s;ix acres of ground. To this there is a &s;mall inlet, and an out|let to the &s;outh; and all the waters in this town run &s;outherly and ea&s;terly, and empty into Sudbu|ry, or Concord River. Here are no pot or pearl-a&s;h works.</P>
<P>The growth of wood is &s;ufficient for the town, if prudently u&s;ed, and con&s;i&s;ts of white, red and
<PB N="134" REF="026481_0133_0FD27EC6DBFCB410">
black oak, &s;ome walnut, and more che&s;nut: The low lands are all under cultivation. Upon the whole, this, though not large, its contents being but about 8350 acres, is a good town; and the people are indu&s;trious and wealthy, in general; and ho&s;pitable and peaceable.</P>

<HEAD>SHREWSBURY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1717, November 2d, a grant was made to certain per&s;ons, chiefly of Marlborough, who petitioned therefor, of all the lands lying between the original grant of Lanca&s;|ter on the north; Marlborough, on the ea&s;t; Sut|ton on the &s;outh; and Worce&s;ter on the we&s;t. Mo&s;t of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers were from Marlborough. The tract of land was very long (about fifteen miles north and &s;outh) but not very wide (from three and an half to four and five miles.) The whole was called, by the proprietors, Shrew&s;bury from the beginning.</P>
<P>In about ten years from the date of the grant, it was &s;o &s;tocked with inhabitants, as that the Gene|ral Court incorporated it as a town, by an act which bears date December 19th, 1727, and gave it the name whereby it had all along been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="026481_0134_0FD27EC80A534B98">The town &s;o flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed, as that in a little more than twenty years a &s;econd pari&s;h, in the northerly part, was formed, viz. on the 17th December 1742, which has &s;ince been made a di&s;|tinct town.</P>
<P>The &s;outh part of this original grant which is now Shrew&s;bury, is about &s;even miles in length from north to &s;outh, and about three and an half or four miles in width; and it is bounded by Worce&s;ter on the we&s;t; by Boyl&s;ton on the north; by We&s;tborough and Northborough on the ea&s;t; and by Grafton on the &s;outh.

<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory of this place is but brief, and is as here follows:</P>
<P>On the fourth day of December 1723, the church of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was gathered here, and on the &s;ame day the Rev. Job Cu&s;hing was ordained their fir&s;t Pa&s;tor. He continued in peace and love with his people, and faithfully &s;erving the Lord in the work of the mini&s;try almo&s;t 37 years; and

was &s;uddenly cut off, by a fit of the apoplexy, Augu&s;t 6th, 1760, in the 67th year of his age. And on the 25th of June 1762, the Rev. Jo&s;eph Summer was &s;olemnly inve&s;ted with the pa&s;toral office in this place; and who &s;till continues to mini&s;ter to them in holy things. There are a few Bapti&s;ts in the &s;outh part of the town, but no church of that denomination.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to a Geographical De&s;crip|tion of this town, I have thought that &s;o remarka|ble and &s;orrowful an occurrence as took place in Shrew&s;bury, in its infancy, ought to be recorded in this hi&s;tory. I &s;hall give it in the words of the account publi&s;hed in the only New&s;paper (I have been told) then printed in Newengland, if not on this &s;ide Philadelphia. It was a &s;mall half &s;heet printed by B. Green.</P>

<P>"An exact account of the awful burning of Capt. John Keyes's hou&s;e, with five per&s;ons in it, at Shrew&s;bury, in the night between the 7th and 8th of this in&s;t. taken from a letter of the Rev.

<P>"Capt. Keyes was building an hou&s;e about nine or ten feet off his old one. It was almo&s;t fini&s;hed. And Mr. Bragg afore&s;aid, the carpenter, with his brother Abiel, of 17 years of age, and William Oaks of 18, his apprentices, were work|ing

about it. Capt. Keyes, with his wife and four daughters, lodged in the old one; and the three carpenters, with three &s;ons of the Captain's, viz. Solomon of twenty, John of thirteen, and Steven of &s;ix years of age, lay in the new. On the Wedne&s;day night, going to bed, they took a more than ordina|ry care of the fire, being excited thereto by the &s;aying of one, <HI>He would not have the hou&s;e burnt for an hundred pounds</HI>; and the reply of another, <HI>He would not for two hundred.</HI> Upon which, they care|fully raked away the chips lying near it, and &s;tayed till the re&s;t were almo&s;t burnt out; and then they went all &s;ix together into three beds in one of the chambers; and were very cheerly and merry at their going to bed, which was about ten of the clock.</P>
<P>"But about midnight Mr. Bragg was awaked with a notion of the hou&s;e being on fire, and a multitude calling to quench it; with which he got up, &s;aw nothing, heard no voice, but could hardly fetch any breath, through the &s;tifling &s;moke; concluded the hou&s;e was on fire, perceiv|ed &s;ome body &s;tirring, again&s;t whom he hit two or three times in the dark: And not being able to &s;peak, or to breathe any longer, and &s;triking his forehead again&s;t the chimney, he thought of the window and happily found it: When he gained it, he tarried a minute, holding it fa&s;t with one hand, and reaching out the other, in hopes of meet|ing with &s;ome or other to &s;ave them, till the &s;moke and fire came &s;o thick and &s;corching upon him, he could endure no longer; and hearing no noi&s;e in the chamber, only, as he thought, a faint groan or

The town is not very uneven con&s;idered altogether, but is pretty rocky. There is a very large and exten&s;ive pro&s;pect from the middle of the town, and all round the meeting|hou&s;e, ea&s;t and we&s;t, north and &s;outh, and from &s;ome parts of the town &s;even meetinghou&s;es can be di&s;|cerned. The land, in general, is rather rough and hard, but the &s;oil is &s;trong, rich, and very produc|tive when &s;ubdued. The higher lands are very good for orcharding, and fruit trees of all kinds, and for pa&s;turage, and even for mowing; for the land is not dry, and it bears a dry &s;ea&s;on exceed|ing well. It is not &s;o well proportioned with til|lage land; however, what they till is very produc|tive, and richly repays the labour be&s;towed upon it.

<P>The town is pretty well &s;upplied with w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, by various &s;prings and rivulets, although there is not one large &s;tream which runs through the town. The large&s;t &s;tream in the town is that which i&s;&s;ues from Sewall's Pond, which is within the limits of Boyl&s;ton, and running &s;outherly a mile and a quarter, falls into Long Pond, on the road to Worce&s;ter, over which is the bridge at the head of &s;aid pond. This pond, called by the natives, Quin&s;igamond, but commonly <HI>Long Pond,</HI> is a beautiful piece of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ater, in the form of a cre&s;cent, nearly four miles in length, as it runs (though on a &s;traight line but three miles and twenty four rods) and it is from 100 rods to nearly a mile in width, although in one place, it be not more than forty rods. This pond lies almo&s;t wholly within the bounds of Shrew&s;bury, not more than one acre falling within the limits of Worce&s;ter. It is, per|haps, the large&s;t and fine&s;t pond in the county. Indeed, it may very fitly be denominated a lake. Upon the top of the hill, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Shrew&s;|bury, it appears to travellers as a large river, or|namented with woods on each &s;ide. It affords great plenty of fi&s;h, as pickerel, large perch, eels, &s;hiners, breams, &amp;c. and the brooks which run into it, contain &s;ome trout. The water of this pond is in general deep; in &s;ome places it has been found ninety &s;ix feet deep.

The fir&s;t, or uppermo&s;t, at the north end, is call|ed Little Pine I&s;land, has upon it a thicket of vines, and contains about a quarter of an acre. The &s;econd is Gra&s;s I&s;land, covered with gra&s;s and willows, and which has been mowed in a dry &s;ea|&s;on. The third is called Sherman's I&s;land, and contains about one acre and an half, and has a growth of &s;mall timber and wood upon it, of dif|ferent kinds. The fourth is called Bowman's I&s;l|and, of about three acres, and is clothed with pine and other timber. The fifth is denominated Bar|berry I&s;land, from the con&s;iderable quantity of tho&s;e berries which grow thereon; this contains about three acres. The &s;ixth is another Gra&s;s I&s;land, having upon it willows and waterbu&s;hes. The &s;eventh is known by the name of Grape I&s;land, of about the fourth of an acre, bears large quan|tities of grapes. The eighth, commonly call|ed Sharp Pine I&s;land, of three quarters of an acre, is covered with divers &s;orts of wood.

From them runs a river, at the &s;outhea&s;t, which pa&s;&s;es into Grafton, whereon are a number of mills, and other water works. There is a &s;mall outlet from Long Pond, &s;outherly, into Flint's Pond; and from Flint's Pond ea&s;twardly, there is an out|let into the river ju&s;t mentioned. And what is truly noticeable is this, while the water, more gen|erally, runs out of Long Pond into Flint's Pond, yet in the drier &s;ea&s;ons of the year, the water runs out of Flint's Pond into Long Pond; for Flint's Pond is fed by &s;prings and rivulets, which keep it always full.

<P>ON the 4th of November, 1719, the General Court, at the reque&s;t of a number of gen|tlemen, made a grant to them of this territory for a valuable con&s;ideration, re&s;erving, however, col|lege, &s;chool, and mini&s;terial rights of land; as al&s;o a right to the fir&s;t ordained mini&s;ter.</P>

compliment to George II, who, the preceding year, came to the Briti&s;h throne; and was &s;tyled Duke of Lunenburg, as having in his German do|minions a town of that name.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ettler in this place, was a Mr. Samuel Page, who was dubbed governor Page, and is mentioned by that title to this day: He lived to a great age, and died in September, 1747. Many of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers were emigrants from Ireland and Scotland; who&s;e de&s;cendants, by intermarriages, are now blended and incorporated with the other inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of the place is as fol|lows. Like people in general, at that day, who came to America for the &s;ake of enjoying the &s;ac|red rights of con&s;cience, they were fond of &s;up|porting the publick in&s;titutions of religion, and took early care to &s;ettle a mini&s;ter: Accordingly, here a church was gathered, and the Rev. Andrew Gardner, (who had been the fir&s;t mini&s;ter at Wor|ce&s;ter) was in&s;talled their fir&s;t mini&s;ter on the 15th of May, 1728, a little before the incorporation of the town. Mr. Gardner continued not four years in the mini&s;try here; being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the 22d of February, 1732. After his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, he moved up nigh to Connecticut River, in Newhamp&s;hire State, where he died, but a few years &s;ince, in a very advanced age.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mini&s;ter of Lunenburg, was the Rev. David Stearns, who was ordained April 18th, 1733; and died of a peripneumony, March 9th, 1761, in the 52d year of his age, and 28th of his
<PB N="145" REF="026481_0144_0FD056EE08B2E208">
mini&s;try. As he lived greatly beloved, he died no le&s;s lamented.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded, for a few days, by the Rev. Samuel Pay&s;on, who was &s;eparated unto the &s;acred work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try September 8th, 1762; and died February 14th, 1763, of an atrophy.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by the Rev. Zabdiel Adams, who was &s;olemnly con&s;ecrated unto the &s;ervice of God, in the go&s;pel of his Son, on the 5th of Sep|tember, 1764, and who is &s;till living.</P>
<P>During the admini&s;tration of the&s;e mini&s;ters there have been baptized, of infants and adults, down to the pre&s;ent time, no le&s;s than 2400 per|&s;ons: And the church here is comparatively large, containing very little &s;hort of two hundred communicants.</P>
<P>The growth and increa&s;e of Lunenburg was rapid and great; for in the year 1764, the whole town of Fitchburg was taken from it. It is now bounded by Town&s;end, in the county of Middle|&s;ex, on the north; by Shirley, in the &s;ame county, on the ea&s;t; by Leomin&s;ter, on the &s;outh; and by Fitchburg, on the we&s;t. It is about 44 miles di&s;|tant from Bo&s;ton, over Charles River bridge, to the northwe&s;t; and 25 miles north by ea&s;t, from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of this town is &s;weet, and as productive as is u&s;ually found in &s;o northern a &s;ituation. For though the land be in general high, yet by rea&s;on of its cohe&s;ive texture, and having a clayey &s;tratum within a few feet of its &s;urface, it retains moi&s;ture &s;ufficient for vegetation through the whole
<PB N="146" REF="026481_0145_0FD056C888AD0220">
&s;ummer, unle&s;s in &s;ea&s;ons of &s;evere drought. The &s;oil is friendly to the growing of wheat, rye, In|dian corn, oats, &amp;c. The wheat rai&s;ed on the hills is of the fir&s;t quality. Many parts of it bear hemp and flax luxuriantly. The mowing and pa&s;ture lands are equal to what are generally found in the county. It is a place famed for cyder; as their high lands are excellent for orcharding: But the canker worms beginning to infe&s;t the trees, threat|en them with a &s;carcity of this kind of fruit.</P>
<P>The natural growth of wood and timber in the town is oak, white, red, black and gray. Of wal|nut there is con&s;iderable plenty; and of che&s;nut a large proportion. In the low lands there is a&s;h, al&s;o rock and white maple, black, white and yel|low birch, &s;ome beach and other hard wood. Neverthele&s;s, as there is very little wa&s;te land, and the people are numerous, fuel will in a few years be &s;carce and dear. White and yellow pines were plenty in the infancy of the plantation; but from the great and long con&s;umption of both, a &s;carcity is &s;en&s;ibly felt. Although the &s;urface of the town is uneven, and may be denominated hilly; yet it is not rocky; there being, take the town in gener|al, not more than &s;tones &s;ufficient to wall in the &s;everal inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>From the elevated &s;ituation of the land, and its proximity to tho&s;e lofty mountains, the Grand Monadinock in Newhamp&s;hire, and the Watchu|&s;ett in this county, being about twelve miles from the latter, and twenty five from the former, the air is keen and piercing in winter, plea&s;ant in &s;ummer,
<PB N="147" REF="026481_0146_0FD056EF8BCC3BB0">
and through the whole year very &s;alubrious. Here are little or no &s;tagnant waters; but few meadows; and but few brooks and &s;treams. In con&s;equence of which they are in a great degree exempted from fogs, from deleterious vapours and exhala|tions; and having the air ventilated by high winds, the inhabitants are remarkably healthy, and free from tho&s;e di&s;orders of the put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;cent kind which &s;weep off many in other places; and they double their numbers in le&s;s than 25 years. This occa|&s;ions large emigrations, and as the farms are &s;mall in general, being on an average not more than 75 or 80 acres; this, together with the fecundity of the people, produces a large number of pau|pers, with which the town is burdened more &s;o, per|haps, than any other town in the county; creating an expen&s;e beyond that of &s;upporting the go&s;pel. However, the greater part of the people live com|fortably, and a few may be &s;aid to be opulent. The people are indu&s;trious and economical, gen|erous, ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers, and much given to convivial entertainments.</P>
<P>The town labours under other di&s;advantages be|&s;ides tho&s;e already mentioned. For though the directe&s;t route from the northerly part of Connecti|cut River, and from the State of Vermont, to Bo&s;|ton, be through Lunenburg, yet from difficulty in the road for a &s;hort &s;pace of way, and the influ|ence of certain men, the travel pa&s;&s;es to the north or &s;outh of it; whereby the people are left de&s;ti|tute of all the benefit ari&s;ing from travellers de|po&s;iting their money among them.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="026481_0147_0FD056CA82220540">Be&s;ides this, they labour under the want of &s;uf|ficient water to carry their corn and &s;aw mills. Though there are &s;everal &s;mall &s;treams on which there are mills, yet they are generally inoperative a con&s;iderable part of the year. Mulpus, &s;o call|ed, is but a &s;mall brook, which, originating in the we&s;t part of the town, runs ea&s;t about twelve miles, and then empties it&s;elf into the River Na&s;haway, in the north part of Shirley. This deficiency of water obliges &s;ome of the inhabitants to carry their grain to other towns to be ground, a certain part of the year. But while we &s;peak of this &s;ingular deficiency of water, we are con&s;trained to mention a Mr. Wetherbee, who, having built both corn and &s;aw mills, in the &s;outhwe&s;t part of the town, on what is called part of the north branch of Na&s;ha|way River, and finding, by &s;everal years experi|ence, that the water was not &s;ufficient to carry his mills, except in the &s;pring of the year, or in rainy &s;ea&s;ons, was at great expen&s;e to dig a canal, in length about a mile, to convey water from a larger branch of the &s;ame river, (which comes from We&s;tmin&s;ter) into his mill pond; which enables him in a wet &s;ea&s;on, to grind for all; and, in a dry one, for mo&s;t of his numerous cu&s;tomers. An in&s;tance of &s;o &s;pirited and laudable enterprize is worthy to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity. This man, it is thought, makes the be&s;t wheat flour within the compa&s;s of Newengland; and has grain brought to his mill from remote places.</P>
<P>In the &s;outhwe&s;t, &s;outh, and &s;outhea&s;t parts of the town, are three ponds, which, retaining their
<PB N="149" REF="026481_0148_0FD056F118FA5D08">

<P>In giving an account of Lunenburg, we ought not to omit the mention of Edward Hartwell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who early came into the place, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing ad|vantages above people in general, was promoted in the town and county; he was a deacon of the church; and, pa&s;&s;ing different grades of office, was Major of a regiment of militia; a ju&s;tice of the peace; a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas; and a repre&s;entative of the town, with few interruptions, for a great number of years; in which &s;tation he continued until a very advanced period of his life; and, finally, he died in the 97th year of his age, as full of piety as of days. This gentleman was much engaged in the Indian wars, and was very helpful to the neighbouring towns in &s;couring the woods, and driving off the &s;avages. In Lunenburg, indeed, he had little work of this kind to perform. For, though the Indians afore|time inhabited this territory, as is evident by ve&s;|tiges

thereof remaining to this day, yet they never much annoyed the Engli&s;h; they did, indeed, &s;o put them in fear, that between the years 1740 and 1750, the inhabitants frequently went armed to the hou&s;e of God on the &s;abbath. There were al&s;o a few troops &s;tationed in this town at garri&s;oned hou&s;es, to which the people retired at night for &s;afety. In the &s;ummer of the year 1749, the In|dians came into the northwe&s;t limits of the town, and killed two &s;oldiers, Jennings and Blodget, who were &s;tationed there, and carried Mr. John Fitch and his family into captivity, who all re|turned in &s;afety, after enduring incredible hard|&s;hips and fatigues, except Mrs. Fitch who &s;icken|ed and died in Canada.</P>
<P>Lunenburg is almo&s;t wholly &s;ettled: The town contains but 14000 acres of land; and on this &s;pace, when the late cen&s;us was taken, there were 192 hou&s;es, and nearly 1300 &s;ouls.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e the account of Lunenburg in the words of the Rev. Mr. Adams, in a letter to the author. "The town is much more remarka|ble for the health than the wealth of its inhabitants. Almo&s;t de&s;titute of travel through it, the people live an independent, but &s;olitary life. In their ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical affairs they have been remarkably peace|able. They di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Mr. Gardner; but becau&s;e he was unworthy. Two of their mini&s;ters died in rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. None of them were &s;o long in the mini&s;try, nor &s;o old, as my&s;elf. Almo&s;t thirty years have I lived among them in profound peace."</P>

<HEAD>DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE grant of this town&s;hip was orig|inally made to the Hon. Me&s;&s;rs. Paul and Wil|liam Dudley, of Roxbury, while yet in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the aborigines, the tribe known at this day, by the name of the Pegan Tribe. It was to com|pri&s;e all the lands between Wood&s;tock, or the col|ony line, &s;outh; Oxford, north; the grant to Medfield, now Sturbridge, we&s;t; and New&s;her|burne, now Dougla&s;s, ea&s;t. This tract of land was incorporated by act of the Legi&s;lature, on the 2d of February, 1731, and the name of <HI>Dudley</HI> was given to it, as a token of re&s;pect to that family, who were principal proprietors of the &s;oil, and great benefactors to the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in their in|fancy. Since the incorporation of Dudley, an ad|dition was made to it by a &s;trip of land taken from Oxford, and annexed thereto. The pre&s;ent extent of this town is nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t about nine miles; north and &s;outh about four miles. It is now bounded, north, by Oxford, and Charlton; ea&s;t, by Dougla&s;s; &s;outh, by the &s;tate line, or Wood&s;tock; and we&s;t, by Sturbridge.</P>
<P>Dudley has but one religious &s;ociety, viz. con|gregational, although there may be about thirty families of various other per&s;ua&s;ions, in the place. The church of Chri&s;t here was founded in the year 1732, and the Rev. Perley Howe was &s;olemnly in|ve&s;ted

The Rev. Mr. Howe was afterwards in|&s;talled at Killing&s;ley in Connecticut. He was &s;ucceeded in the pa&s;toral office at Dudley by the Rev. Charles Glea&s;on, who was ordained October 31&s;t, 1744. He continued the worthy, faithful and beloved mini&s;ter of the town until his death, which took place May 7th, 1790. The Rev. Jo&s;hua John&s;on, who had been for a &s;hort time mini&s;ter of the north pari&s;h in Wood&s;tock, was in&s;talled Pa&s;tor of the church and congregation in Dudley, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Mr. Glea&s;on, December 1&s;t, 1790.</P>
<P>The congregational meetinghou&s;e, which is the only one in this town, was erected in the year 1734. It &s;tands on an hill, which commands a &s;outh pro&s;pect of exten&s;ive farms even to the di&s;|tance of twelve miles. Four acres of land on the &s;ummit of this hill were given to the town for pub|lick u&s;es, by the Pegan tribe of Indians, on condi|tion that all of their tribe, who &s;hould ever inhabit the town, &s;hould have the right to convenient &s;eats in the meetinghou&s;e on days of public wor&s;hip. This tribe &s;till exi&s;ts, to the number of ten or twelve, and hold about 200 acres of excellent land near the middle of the town; but their whole intere&s;t is con&s;tantly taken care of by a com|mittee of the General Court.</P>
<P>The general face of this town is hilly, but not mountainous. It is richly and beautifully inter|&s;per&s;ed with hills, valleys, and &s;treams of water.
<PB N="153" REF="026481_0152_0FD056F40A12A0E8">

The &s;oil in general is good and fertile, pro|ducing all &s;orts of grain and fruit, and gra&s;s in plen|ty; and the land affords a &s;ufficiency of &s;tones for fencing in the farms. There is one hill in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot very high, famous for yielding great quantities of mo&s;t beautiful building &s;tones.

<P>The fore&s;ts, are principally of oak, che&s;nut, and walnut, yellow pine, and &s;ome white pine.</P>
<P>This town abounds with ponds, &s;treams, rivers and &s;prings. There are four large ponds, well &s;tored with all the u&s;ual &s;orts of fi&s;h: But there is one e&s;pecially in the ea&s;t part of the town, called by the Indians Chaubunagungamaug: This is five miles in length, and one in breadth. Through the we&s;t part of the town, from northwe&s;t to the &s;outh|ea&s;t, runs the rapid river Quinebaug, of about twen|ty yards in width, coming from Sturbridge, and pa&s;&s;ing down on the ea&s;t of Wood&s;tock, Pomfret, &amp;c. to Norwich.

<P>This is a large and flouri&s;hing town, the people &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by farming, except the u&s;ual me|chanicks, and a few traders; and when the enumer|ation of the Commonwealth was made, there were 160 hou&s;es and 1114 inhabitants in the place.

<HEAD>HARVARD.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Harvard is &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the county, thirty five miles from Bo&s;ton, a little to the north of we&s;t, and is twenty three miles from the courthou&s;e in Wor|ce&s;ter, to the northea&s;t. It is bounded by Groton on the north; by Lyttleton on the northea&s;t; by Boxborough on the ea&s;t; by Stow on the &s;outh|ea&s;t; by Bolton on the &s;outh; and on the we&s;t by the river Na&s;haway, which &s;eparates it from Lan|ca&s;ter, and Shirley. Harvard was not an original grant, but taken from Lanca&s;ter, Stow and Groton, principally from the two former. From the cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="155" REF="026481_0154_0FD056F5880DCC50">
of its being made up of the corners of other towns, it was rather irregular in its &s;hape; but before the incorporation of Boxborough, which took off the ea&s;terly angle of this town, it was nearly equal to &s;even miles &s;quare: It is now more than &s;ix. The bill for the incorporation of this tract of land pa&s;&s;ed the Legi&s;lature, June 29th, 1732, when it was called Harvard, to bear up the name of that excellent and worthy mini&s;ter of Charle&s;town the Rev. John Harvard, who died in 1638, who laid the foundation of Harvard Univer|&s;ity in Cambridge, bequeathing thereto 779<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> when by a &s;pecial order of court, it took the name of Harvard College. At the time of the in|corporation of the town of Harvard, it con&s;i&s;ted of about 50 families.</P>
<P>The town of Harvard is very hilly and uneven; the land is rough and hard to &s;ubdue, but the &s;oil is warm and &s;trong, rich and fertile. It produces good crops of grain of all kinds. Such broken land, however, is better adapted to the rai&s;ing of wheat and rye, than Indian corn. As the town|&s;hip is rocky, the farmers are induced to appropri|ate a large proportion of their land to gra&s;s and pa&s;turage. The principal articles carried hence to market, are beef, pork, butter, and chee&s;e. The high lands are particularly fertile in che&s;nut trees, who&s;e fruit yields the owners no incon&s;iderable profit. And as the lands are excellent for orch|arding, many farmers pay particular attention to rai&s;ing all kinds of fruit, which they have in plen|ty, and of the be&s;t quality.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="026481_0155_0FD056D0097CF868">There are about 1000 acres of what is called interval land in this town; though perhaps half of it may more properly be &s;tyled meadow.</P>
<P>Although there are &s;everal hills in this place, yet there are but three which have names, or mer|it particular notice. The fir&s;t we &s;hall mention is called <HI>Pin Hill,</HI> from its remarkable form which is pyramidical. The perpendicular height of this hill, from the brook which runs at the foot of it, is judged to be two hundred feet. In the bowels of this hill are contained va&s;t quantities of blue or &s;late &s;tone. It lea&s;es to the &s;tone cutters in this and a neighbouring town for 6<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> per annum. The &s;tones taken hence, are not &s;o ea&s;ily wrought, as &s;ome of a &s;imilar kind: But on this account, however, they are more valuable for jambs and hearths, as they in the &s;ame proportion, do the more re&s;i&s;t the heat of fire. The&s;e &s;tones are chiefly u&s;ed, for grave and tomb &s;tones; and are carried to a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e called Bear Hill, and Oak Hill, are not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, di&s;tinct hills, but links only in a chain of hills, which begins in the we&s;t part of Lyttleton, and extends &s;outhwe&s;terly through Harvard, as far as the centre of Bolton. Oak Hill, however, which ri&s;es in the ea&s;terly part of the town, is the &s;ummit of this range, and affords a pro&s;pect &s;ingularly diver&s;ified and exten&s;ive. The land upon the&s;e hills is mo&s;tly exceeding good.</P>
<P>The general growth of wood in Harvard, is the &s;ame as in other towns of &s;imilar &s;oils. Che&s;nut, oak of all kinds, and walnut, con&s;titute the princi|pal
<PB N="157" REF="026481_0156_0FD056F74C6F2E88">
part on the high lands. They have &s;ome white pine, and in the northerly part, con&s;iderable pitch pine. In the low lands they have much elm, &s;ome butternut and button wood, birch, a&s;h, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Harvard is like other hilly, rocky places, not dry, but moi&s;t land, and well watered indeed by numerous &s;prings and rivulets, running about a|mong the hills, and which cau&s;e them to rejoice on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>Na&s;haway, or Lanca&s;ter River, flows along the confines of Harvard upwards of &s;ix miles. The depth of the water, when the bed of the river is full, is about twelve feet; and about &s;ix feet at low water. This river, an humble imitator of the Nile, overflows its banks at certain &s;ea&s;ons, and greatly fertilizes the bordering lands.</P>
<P><HI>Still River</HI> originates in &s;ome mar&s;hes and quag|mires in the we&s;terly part of Bolton, and is joined by a brook running from the interval lands in Lanca&s;ter, near the river. The&s;e two &s;treams unite in Harvard, and compo&s;e what is called <HI>Still River,</HI> or long pond, or lake, which pa&s;&s;es in a &s;ilent and almo&s;t imperceptible manner, for three miles, (one mile or more of which is in Harvard,) and then by a &s;mall outlet, empties it&s;elf into the river Na&s;haway.</P>
<P>There are two or three ponds of &s;ome notoriety in this town. The large&s;t of the&s;e begins but a little &s;outhwe&s;terly of the meetinghou&s;e, and very nigh the &s;eat of Col. Bromfield, and extends away &s;outherly. It is called <HI>Bear Hill Pond,</HI> as it lies upon the we&s;terly &s;ide of that hill. Its figure is
<PB N="158" REF="026481_0157_0FD056D18A087758">
oblong: Its circumference more than three miles. In this pond are two &s;mall i&s;lands of about three acres each. The greate&s;t depth of this pond is not more than twenty feet.</P>
<P>At the north we&s;t angle of the town, is &s;ituated what is commonly called <HI>Hell Pond,</HI> from its amazing depth, being ninety five feet in one place, by mea&s;ure; and between eighty and ninety feet in general, all over the pond, and immediately as you launch from &s;hore. This pond is nearly cir|cular. Its diameter is about three hundred yards. Fi&s;h were never caught here until within a few years, when pike and perch were put therein, which have &s;ince multiplied exceedingly. Near this is a &s;mall pond, with which the former is &s;uppo&s;ed to maintain a &s;ubterraneous communication. There is al&s;o another, in the north part of the town, call|ed <HI>Robbins</HI>'s <HI>Pond;</HI> but this is not remarkable for &s;ize or depth. About an hundred rods from Hell Pond, is a &s;pring, known by the name of <HI>Cold Spring.</HI> The waters hereof are always pure and cold, and never freeze. The head of this &s;pring is two or three yards broad. Bear Hill Pond emits a &s;tream from its north &s;ide, which almo&s;t winds around Pin Hill; and which, within the limits of Harvard, &s;upplies with water, four gri&s;t mills, one &s;aw mill, one clothiers' works, one forge, and one trip hammer. The&s;e are all in the north part of the town. In the &s;outh part, there are two gri&s;t mills, and one &s;aw mill, furni&s;hed with water from two &s;treams which i&s;&s;ue from the ea&s;t &s;ide of the chain of hills above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="026481_0158_0FD056F88B72E0B0">It is worthy of particular mention, that the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the above hills is uniformly &s;teep, while the oppo&s;ite &s;ide has a gentle and gradual declivity.</P>
<P>At the foot of Oak Hill, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, there is a mine which may be ju&s;tly deemed a cu|rio&s;ity. Early in the year 1783, when a rage for the trea&s;ures, thought to be hid in the bowels of the earth, was prevalent in the country, it was thought by &s;ome per&s;ons, from the colour of the earth in this place, and from the working of the mineral rods, that &s;ilver ore might be obtained not far beneath the &s;urface of the ground. According|ly &s;ome gentlemen in this town and its vicinity, (twenty five in number) formed them&s;elves into a mine company for the purpo&s;e of de&s;crying tho&s;e hidden trea&s;ures, and enriching them&s;elves there|with. Under the conduct of certain men, Me&s;&s;rs. Ives and Peck, they began their operations in July following. The&s;e were continued, though with frequent interruptions, until &s;ometime in the year 1789. During this time, they had, with &s;ome dif|ficulty, digged through a con&s;iderable quantity of conden&s;ed gravel, until they came to a &s;olid rock: Into this they penetrated more than forty feet. But, either from the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the mineral|i&s;ts, or for want of per&s;everance in their employ|ers, the &s;hining ore has not yet been di&s;covered. The company, after expending one thou&s;and one hundred dollars in the proce&s;s, is amically di&s;&s;olved. The &s;ides of this cavity are almo&s;t rectilinear. It is about &s;ix feet high, and half as wide. The ex|cavation
<PB N="160" REF="026481_0159_0FD056D352AB5F88">
was made, partly by heating the rock to a great degree, and then cooling it &s;uddenly with water; but the greater portion of it was effected with powder. Pieces of the earth, which they dug before they entered the rock, had the appearance of yellow lead, and were con&s;iderably &s;ulphure|ous. This cavern now re&s;ts a de&s;erted monument of &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s toils. Its mouth opens to the ea&s;t; and the ri&s;ing &s;un, to a per&s;on in the other ex|tremity, renders the pro&s;pect highly delightful.</P>
<P>The town of Harvard is large and numerous, here are 200 dwelling hou&s;es, which, like tho&s;e of mo&s;t country towns in this State, are &s;cattered over the place without much order; and con&s;i&s;t of &s;ome good and more ordinary buildings. The inhabit|ants are 1400; the&s;e are chiefly farmers, who are frugal and indu&s;trious, and &s;ome are become wealthy. They have two or three traders in foreign goods, and all the u&s;ual &s;orts of mechanicks.</P>
<P>This town di&s;covers great &s;olicitude for the good education of its children. The inhabitants divide them&s;elves into eight di&s;tricts: In each there is a neat and commodious &s;choolhou&s;e; and &s;ix of them, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, are furni&s;hed with latin grammar in&s;tructors; the other two with Engli&s;h grammar ma&s;ters. In the &s;ummer, the very young children are taught by approved females; while they who are more advanced, are handling the plough and the di&s;taff. Here a library company has lately been formed. They have at pre&s;ent, a|bout one hundred volumes in their library. No doubt it will &s;oon be con&s;iderably augmented.
<PB N="161" REF="026481_0160_0FD056FA0A708410">
There is al&s;o here a &s;ocial club e&s;tabli&s;hed, con|&s;i&s;ting of twelve of the principal inhabitants, who have monthly meetings. In them they endeavour to acquire information on the common, as well as on the mo&s;t important affairs agitated in the world.</P>
<P>The principles and modes of religion in Har|vard, are uncommonly numerous. Within the limits of the town dwell congregationali&s;ts, ana|bapti&s;ts, pre&s;byterians, epi&s;copalians, univer&s;al|i&s;ts and &s;hakers. Until after the commencement of the late war, they were all of the denomination fir&s;t-mentioned; and this &s;till compri&s;es five &s;evenths of the &s;ouls in the town.</P>
<P>The congregational church in Harvard was im|bodied by an eccle&s;ia&s;tical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouncil, October 10th, 1738, and the Rev.

Mr. Seccombe was afterwards employed many years in the work of the mini&s;try in the province of Nova|&s;cotia, where he died in 1792, aged eighty four years. Mr. Seccombe was &s;ucceeded in the work of the mini&s;try at Harvard, by the Rev. Jo&s;eph Wheeler, who was con&s;ecrated thereunto Decem|ber 12th, 1759. In a few years Mr. Wheeler was afflicted with bodily infirmities, which peculiarly affected his voice, in con&s;equence whereof he &s;o|licited a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from that &s;acred employment, which accordingly took place by advice and un|der the direction of a mutual council, July 28th,

1768. Mr. Wheeler was &s;oon after, and for &s;everal years employed by the town as their rep|re&s;entative in the General Court.

<P>Sometime in the year 1780, the leaders of that &s;ect of religioni&s;ts, called &s;hakers, came into this town; and as there are few of them indeed in any other part of the county, it is highly fitting and proper to give a full account of them in this place.</P>
<P>They fixed them&s;elves down in a corner of Har|vard, where &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m had con|&s;iderably flouri&s;hed under the au&s;pices of one Mr. Ireland. A part of this man's followers kindled at this new torch of fanatici&s;m, while the majority of the&s;e old fa&s;hioned enthu&s;ia&s;ts at the &s;ight of the &s;hakers' di&s;traction became more rational and &s;o|ber. Since their beginning in Harvard, they have been continually making reforms in their &s;enti|ments, modes of wor&s;hip and manners. In a re|ligious and political view they have greatly me|liorated. From gro&s;s indecencies in their rites and behaviour, they are become moderate and civil. Formerly they were indolent and trouble|&s;ome in &s;ociety; now they are the mo&s;t indu&s;tri|ous and peaceful members of the community. The number of &s;hakers in Harvard is about one hundred and fifty. The&s;e are divided into three orders; or as they call them, <HI>gifts.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e orders con&s;i&s;ts principally of the younge&s;t and faire&s;t of them who are gathered. The&s;e are under the mo&s;t rigid rules po&s;&s;ible. They are

never to &s;ee any of the world's people, nor con|ver&s;e with them of the lower orders. All their ac|tions, words and &s;teps, are narrowly in&s;pected by their &s;piritual teacher, who almo&s;t per&s;uades them to believe that he is conver&s;ant with their thoughts. They of the fir&s;t order are privileged with his o|ral addre&s;&s;es; to the others he u&s;ually communi|cates his monitions by a me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>The &s;econd order is compo&s;ed of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m who are gathered, but who are more advanced in years, and otherwi&s;e le&s;s vigorous and alert in labour and in devotion.</P>
<P>The lowe&s;t order are they who live about in families.</P>
<P>Extreme &s;implicity in dre&s;s and manners charac|terizes this &s;ingular religious &s;ect. They are neat in their apparel and furniture. The hou&s;es which they have erected in this town, are large and com|modious, and approach to &s;omething like elegance. Their floors and &s;tairs are all covered to prevent making a noi&s;e. They imitate the Moravians apparently more than any other denomination; particularly in their modes of government and &s;ub|ordination. They affect to be wholly under the dominion of the Spirit; and to crucify even the innocent de&s;ires of the fle&s;h, in&s;omuch that they neither marry nor are given in marriage. So &s;trict are they in their laws of ab&s;tinence from women, that the two &s;exes are not permitted to live in the &s;ame hou&s;e, nor even to enter the &s;ame door. In&s;tances of incha&s;tity, e&s;pecially among the governed, &s;eldom or ever occur. The orders
<PB N="165" REF="026481_0164_0FD056FD07B22760">
are under the mo&s;t complete &s;ubjection to their leaders. The utmo&s;t preci&s;ion and regularity are ob&s;erved in their eating, &s;leeping and working. Hence they are making quite rapid proficiency in the lower kinds of the mechanick arts; and &s;uch is their agricultural &s;kill and per&s;everance, that they have reduced the mo&s;t rugged and indoma|ble part of Harvard to a &s;tate re&s;embling that of a garden.</P>
<P>We conclude this account with only remarking, that it is not a little &s;trange, that the leaders of this deluded &s;ect, who certainly can claim no pre|eminence above ordinary men in point of capacity and improvement, &s;hould thus keep bound in &s;er|vitude &s;o great a number of their brethren in the very heart of Newengland. But it will be &s;trang|er &s;till, if in &s;uch an era as this, the majority of the &s;hakers, who now pant for liberty, &s;hould long continue in &s;hackles of bondage to their el|ders.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid what may be thought quite &s;uffi|cient upon the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and religious &s;tate of Harvard, we &s;hall clo&s;e our account of this place, with &s;aying it is a large, pro&s;perous and wealthy town; and notwith&s;tanding the diver&s;ity of &s;ects, the people are peaceable and happy.</P>

<P>THIS is that tract of land of four miles &s;quare, which was re&s;erved for the Indians when the town of Sutton was granted to the Eng|li&s;h. It was called by the Indians Ha&s;&s;anami&s;co, and known by that name only until April 18th, 1735, when it was incorporated by an act of the Legi&s;lature, and called Grafton. Since its in|corporation one half a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> land was taken from Shrew&s;bury and added to Grafton, on the north, and about half a mile of Sutton, on the &s;outh, was annexed to it; &s;o that Grafton is now five miles in length, from north to &s;outh, and four in width from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This town is bound|ed, on the north, by Shrew&s;bury; on the ea&s;t, by We&s;tborough and Upton; on the &s;outh, by Upton and Sutton; and on the we&s;t, by Sutton.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t there were divers Indian families here: As they dimini&s;hed, the white people became proprietors of the &s;oil, by purcha&s;e; and a grant from the General Court, upon the&s;e conditions, however, that they &s;hould always provide preach|ing and &s;chooling, and &s;eats in the meetinghou&s;e, for the remaining Indians. And as the people hold the lands of the original four miles &s;quare, on &s;uch conditions, they mu&s;t all of whatever per|&s;ua&s;ion, be equally bound to contribute to the &s;up|port of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter in the place. The Gene|ral

Court has from the beginning, appointed a committee of three, called the tru&s;tees of the In|dians' intere&s;t; their bu&s;ine&s;s is to take care of their property, both real and per&s;onal, and di&s;po&s;e of the &s;ame to the be&s;t advantage, for the &s;upport and maintenance of the Indians. This committee, at pre&s;ent, have little to do in the execution of their tru&s;t, as the lands have by length of time, and various concurring circum&s;tances, chiefly pa&s;&s;|ed into the hands of the white people. There are indeed &s;everal farms in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heirs of the Indians, married to negroes; but it is &s;aid there is not one male in the town at this day, who is all of Indian extract or blood.</P>
<P>The Indians very &s;oon decrea&s;ed in this place, and the whites became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and occupiers of the &s;oil; and &s;o early as the 28th of December 1731, a Chri&s;tian congregational church was im|bodied here, and on the next day, the Rev. Solo|mon Prentice was ordained their fir&s;t Pa&s;tor. He became what was called in that day, a zealous newlight, or more properly, a raving enthu&s;ia&s;t. He was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;toral relation to Grafton, July 8th. 1747, and became an itinerant preacher. He was &s;ucceeded in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try at Grafton by the Rev.

By rea&s;on of great bodily infirmities of long continuance, he reque&s;ted a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from his particular relation to the Church and people of Grafton, to which they acceded with great reluctance, and which took place January 1&s;t, 1788. No mini&s;ter is &s;ince &s;ettled in the place. Mr. Gro&s;venor's health, being in a good mea&s;ure re&s;tored, he is mo&s;t con&s;tantly employed in preaching in neighbouring vacant pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>Some years ago there was an anabapti&s;t &s;ocie|ty and church e&s;tabli&s;hed in Grafton, and they had a regular mini&s;ter of publick education &s;ettled with them; but now there is neither mini&s;ter nor church of that denomination in the town, and very few anabapti&s;t families.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to &s;ome Geographical De|&s;cription of Grafton. It is a mo&s;t excellent town|&s;hip of land. The face of the town is hilly and uneven, and in general rocky; but the &s;oil is moi&s;t and &s;trong, rich and very productive: It is good for Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, barley, and flax: The lands are naturally warm and not &s;ub|ject to fro&s;ts; and as they are high and rocky, they are well adapted to orcharding and all kinds of fruit trees. There are three noticeable hills in the town The fir&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e mentioned, is called Che&s;nut Hill, as abounding in that &s;ort of wood.
<PB N="169" REF="026481_0168_0FD057000BF7A8E0">
This is &s;ituated but a little ea&s;t of the meeting|hou&s;e, and is the highe&s;t land in the town, hiding Grafton from We&s;tborough: This is not large; the land is moi&s;t and good. On the ea&s;terly &s;ide of the town lies George Hill, two miles and an half in length. It took its name from one George Mi&s;co, an Indian who dwelt upon it. This is a hill of mo&s;t excellent land; and there are a num|ber of very fine farms upon it. A third is de|nominated Brigham Hill, from a number of that name who have lived upon it: This lies in the we&s;terly part of the town, is high, about two miles in length; has upon it &s;everal excellent and large farms, though &s;ome parts of it are rough, broken lands.</P>
<P>The general growth of wood is walnut, oak of all kinds, che&s;nut, &s;ome pitch pine, butternut, but|ton wood, black and white a&s;h, and birch. There is &s;ome pine plain land in the town near the rivers.</P>
<P>Black&s;tone River, from the north pari&s;h in Sut|ton, enters Grafton in the &s;outhwe&s;terly part of the town; this is then become a large and beauti|ful river, and runs about three miles in the &s;outh|erly part of Grafton, and then pa&s;&s;es into Upton. Little River, or more properly Quin&s;igamond, be|ing the outlet from the pond of that name, runs along on the we&s;t &s;ide of the town, within about half a mile of the meetinghou&s;e, and between that and Brigham Hill; and about one mile and an half &s;outh from the meetinghou&s;e joins Black&s;tone Riv|er. On the&s;e rivers, before and after the junction, there are con&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble bodies of good meadow,

and rich interval lands. The River A&s;&s;abet, which runs northea&s;t, and empties into Merrimack, has its &s;ource in Grafton, about one mile and an half northea&s;t from the meetinghou&s;e: This pa&s;&s;es through the northwe&s;t angle of We&s;tborough, into Northborough, &amp;c. Be&s;ides the&s;e, on the we&s;t &s;ide of George Hill, runs George Brook, which ri&s;es in the northerly part of Grafton; this pa&s;&s;es to the &s;outh. On this &s;tream there are large and good meadows. There is no pond in the town. Upon the &s;everal rivers and &s;treams abovementioned, there are four gri&s;t mills, &s;everal &s;aw mills, three trip hammers, and one fulling mill. The town abounds with rivulets and &s;prings of water.</P>
<P>The people &s;ub&s;i&s;t mainly by the cultivation of the &s;oil, and they are amply recompen&s;ed for all their labour. They have one or two traders in foreign goods, and the u&s;ual trade&s;men and me|chanicks; and here pot a&s;h making is carried on. Grafton, though not a large tract of land, yet be|ing a rich and good &s;oil, is pretty well filled with people, and they are become wealthy. There were nearly 900 inhabitants when the cen&s;us was taken about two years ago. This town reaps con|&s;iderable advantage from the travel through it. A road much u&s;ed, leading from Connecticut to Bo&s;|ton, pa&s;&s;es through this town; as al&s;o the po&s;t road from Worce&s;ter to Providence. Grafton is forty miles from Bo&s;ton, to the &s;outhwe&s;t: It is thirty four miles from Providence, to the northwe&s;t, and eight from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, a little to the &s;outh of ea&s;t.</P>

<P><PB N="175" REF="026481_0174_0FD0570524DF50D8">After the location of this grant a number of &s;et|tlers immediately entered upon the lands, and oth|ers followed &s;o rapidly, as that they &s;oon had the go&s;|pel preached among them, and as early as November 17th, 1736, a little more than four years from the date of the grant, the church of Chri&s;t was gather|ed, and the &s;ame day the Rev.

The land is generally rocky and moi&s;t; and it is finely watered in every part by &s;prings, &s;treams and rivulets, which run about in the val|leys among the hills; but there are no &s;treams of note or di&s;tinction in the town, although they fur|ni&s;h water for all &s;orts of water works; and there are within the town, five corn mills, four &s;aw mills, and two clothiers' works, where much bu&s;ine&s;s is performed to the great advantage of the people.</P>
<P>Ware River, which is large, runs on the ea&s;t and &s;outh of the town, and is the boundary between this town and Newbraintree, and al&s;o between Hardwick and the town of Ware. The inter|val on this river, in the ea&s;tern part of the town, may contain perhaps as much as two hundred a|cres of very excellent mowing land.

The tract of land was large at fir&s;t: In the year 1784, the di&s;|trict of Berlin, to the &s;outh, was &s;et off from it: Still it is large enough to make a very re&s;pectable figure among the towns in the county. It contain|ed,

when the continental cen&s;us was taken, 125 hou&s;es, and 861 inhabitants. It is bounded by Lanca&s;ter on the we&s;t; by Harvard, on the north; by Stow, in the county of Middle&s;ex, on the ea&s;t; by Marlborough on the &s;outhea&s;t; and by Berlin, on the &s;outh. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s di&s;tant from Bo&s;ton about thirty four miles nearly we&s;t; and from the court|hou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, it is about eighteen miles, ly|ing to the northea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of Bolton is as fol|lows. The church of Chri&s;t here was gathered on the 4th of November, 1741; on which day the Rev. Thomas Go&s;s was ordained their fir&s;t pa&s;tor, who continued until January 17th, 1780, when he died in the &s;ixty third year of his age, and thirty ninth of his mini&s;try. He was &s;ucceeded, a &s;hort &s;pace of time, by the Rev. John Walley, who had been before for &s;everal years mini&s;ter of a pari&s;h in Ip&s;wich. Mr. Walley was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Bol|ton, not long before his death. He was &s;ucceeded in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try in this place, by the Rev. Phineas Wright, who was &s;olemnly &s;epa|rated hereunto October 26th, 1785, and who &s;till lives. The people are peaceable and happy, pro&s;|perous and flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>In Bolton, and the di&s;trict of Berlin, there is a &s;ociety of friends, or quakers, con&s;i&s;ting of a large number of mo&s;tly wealthy families; their hou&s;e of wor&s;hip &s;tands within the limits of Bolton, near to Berlin line.</P>
<P>We &s;hall proceed to give &s;ome Geographical De&s;cription of Bolton. The town in general is
<PB N="179" REF="026481_0178_0FD0570789DB48F0">
good land, not level, nor yet has it any very high hills. The highe&s;t lands in the town are rich and moi&s;t; excellent for orcharding and pa&s;ture land. It is not very rocky, however, there are &s;tones &s;uf|ficient to wall in all their farms. The people rai&s;e rye, wheat, Indian corn, barley, oats, flax, &amp;c. &amp;c. upon their lands, in &s;uch plenty as richly to repay their labour in the cultivation thereof. A|bout half a mile from the centre of the town, to the we&s;t, begins the great hill, known by the name of Wattoquottock Hill, which extends &s;outhwe&s;terly into Berlin. This long, large hill, is not very high; it is in general very good land, and there are div|ers fine farms upon it. The great road from Lanca&s;ter to Bo&s;ton pa&s;&s;es over the north end of this hill, upon its declivity, where it is very moi&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of clay and loam, &s;en&s;ibly felt by trav|ellers in the wet &s;ea&s;ons of the year. On the we&s;|terly &s;ide of this hill, about halfway from its foot to the &s;ummit, is a cavity opening to the &s;outh|we&s;t, parallel with the main cour&s;e of the hill, near the upper end of which is a pool, or &s;mall pond of water, known by the name of Welch Pond. This pond is of a circular form about twenty feet in depth, and occupies the &s;pace of a|bout one acre on its &s;urface. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have dimini&s;hed about one half, both in depth and cir|cumference within forty years pa&s;t. People now mow con&s;iderable gra&s;s, where they went with boats and canoes half a century ago. On the &s;outhea&s;terly &s;ide of this hill, and nearly oppo&s;ite to W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Pond, i&s;&s;ue a number of rivulets, which
<PB N="180" REF="026481_0179_0FD056E2CA1FA4F0">
&s;oon unite in the low lands, and form a con&s;idera|ble brook, taking a &s;outhea&s;terly cour&s;e, till it falls into A&s;&s;abet River, in the northerly part of Marlborough. This brook has water &s;ufficient to carry two mills, in the wet &s;ea&s;ons of the year, at the di&s;tance of le&s;s than one mile from the hill. There is a glade of mo&s;t excellent meadow on each &s;ide of this &s;tream, its whole length, with but few &s;mall interruptions, by hard land. The higher parts of the&s;e meadows, next the hill, are known by the name of Wattoquottock Meadows. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the northea&s;terly foot of Wattoquottock, begins another large hill, with a gradual a&s;cent, which extends northea&s;terly through Harvard into the boundaries of Lyttleton, in the county of Middle&s;ex. By &s;ome, this is call|ed Bear Hill, by others Oak-Hill. This hill has been thought to contain mines and minerals, and has, con&s;equently, for a number of years engaged the attention of a re&s;pectable &s;ociety of mine&s;eek|ers; but their expectations have far exceeded their gains: For though its bowels have been explored with much painful labour, and &s;anguine hope, yet the mountain has not even to this day brought forth a mou&s;e. At the inter&s;ection, between this la&s;t mentioned hill and Wattoquottock, is a nar|row bar of hard land, about fifteen rods in width; and on each &s;ide of this bar, is a &s;mall piece of low, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nken, boggy ground, in which ari&s;e &s;everal &s;prings, &s;oon forming a rivulet each way.

waters, and empties into <HI>Still River,</HI> &s;o called, within the boundaries of Lanca&s;ter. The rivulet on the &s;outhea&s;terly &s;ide runs an ea&s;terly cour&s;e; the waters of which being augmented by &s;mall ad|ditions, become &s;ufficient to carry mills, where much bu&s;ine&s;s is done, at the di&s;tance of two miles from their &s;ource, except in the &s;ummer months, and they are emptied into the river A&s;&s;abet, about two miles &s;outhea&s;t from Stow meetinghou&s;e; previous to which, however, the road to Bo&s;ton cro&s;&s;es this &s;tream three times. On this brook are &s;everal bodies of meadow, but not equal in good|ne&s;s to tho&s;e beforementioned. In the northea&s;ter|ly part of Bolton, about two miles and an half from the centre of the town, is &s;ituated the large and ex|ten&s;ive hill, called Rattle Snake Hill, belonging to the heirs of the late Gen. John Whetcomb. In the &s;outh &s;ide of this hill is a body of lime&s;tone; and here are annually made about one hundred and fifty hog&s;heads of the very be&s;t of lime. In the ea&s;terly part of the town is a large hill, known by the name of Long Hill. It lies clo&s;e on the &s;outh &s;ide of, and runs parallel with the great road, about one mile and an half, to Stow line, with a gradual a&s;cent to the &s;outh of about half a mile to its &s;ummit. There are two &s;mall ponds, of a circular form, at the di&s;tance of about eighty rods from each other, in the ea&s;terly part of the town, &s;uppo&s;ed to cover, one about forty, and the other about thirty acres of ground. The large&s;t of the&s;e lies near the we&s;t end of Long Hill, in &s;ight of the great road and known by the name of
<PB N="182" REF="026481_0181_0FD056E449D695D0">
We&s;t's Pond, from a per&s;on of that name formerly living on its &s;hore. In the northwe&s;t angle of Bol|ton, mainly, is &s;ituated a large body of almo&s;t &s;tag|nant water, and therefore called Still River, but might be more properly denominated a lake, or very long pond. It is various in its width and depth. It begins within the boundaries of Lan|ca&s;ter, in the great intervals (about twenty rods ea&s;t of the great bridge over the Na&s;haway, after the junction of its two branches) and proceeds in a circular cour&s;e, upwards of three miles, acro&s;s the northwe&s;t corner of Bolton, into Harvard, from the north end of which there is a very &s;mall outlet in|to the river Na&s;haway. On the &s;outh &s;ide of this lake, and between this and the river Na&s;haway, is a very large body of mo&s;t excellent interval land, part of which is within the limits of Bolton, u&s;ed for tillage, mowing and pa&s;turing: And which is often laid &s;everal feet under water by &s;pring and fall floods, pre&s;enting the appearance of a &s;mall &s;ea.</P>
<P>Various are the conjectures of people re&s;pecting Still River, Lake, or Long Pond, above mentioned. Some &s;uppo&s;e the bed of the &s;outh branch of Na&s;h|away once was here, and that by &s;ome great fre&s;het it was cut off above, formed a new channel, and joined the north branch the &s;ooner, where the junction now is. Be this as it may, it is certain the&s;e branches have &s;hifted their beds, in various places, and of con&s;iderable lengths, in the revolu|tion of ages. There are &s;everal rivulets fall into this lake on its ea&s;terly &s;ide; but there is no in|let at its upper end, exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

directly out of the ground; and the great proba|bility is, that a &s;tream, which begins in Bolton, feeds this Lake by a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age; for while this &s;tream is con&s;tant, bri&s;k and lively, for half a mile, coming to a &s;pot of pine, &s;andy land, it di&s;appears, and no water is di&s;cernible for near two miles. There is a &s;mall inlet into this lake on the ea&s;tern part of Lanca&s;ter intervals, in wet &s;ea|&s;ons, but in the &s;ummer no water runs in this, and yet the lake appears no way to be affected thereby.</P>
<P>Let us leave this lake, and fini&s;h our De&s;crip|tion of Bolton.</P>
<P>There are two pot a&s;h works in this place, and one of pearl a&s;h. Here are two famous brickyards where above two hundred thou&s;ands of bricks are annual|ly made. The town is very well wooded. On the high lands there is plenty of walnut, che&s;nut, and oak of all &s;orts: And here va&s;t numbers of barrels and hog&s;heads are manufactured yearly; and great quantities of hoops are carried to market. In the low lands there is much maple, but little a&s;h, &s;ome birch. There are &s;ome plains covered with pitch pine, very little white pine.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this is a town of rich, &s;trong and good land, and the people are increa&s;ing in number wealth and reputation. They are now building a large elegant meetinghou&s;e, upon the modern con&s;truction, with a &s;teeple to it, to which Me&s;&s;rs. Jo&s;hua and James Richard&s;on, formerly of Bo&s;ton, have generou&s;ly contributed 100<HI>l.</HI> and bought their pews, as others, at ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">due, but upon

<HEAD>STURBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is &s;tyled in the act for erecting the county of Worce&s;ter, "The land lately grant|ed to &s;everal petitioners of Medfield," and many of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers here were from the town of Med|field, and hence the place was called Newmedfield, until its incorporation, which was, by an act of Court, on the 24th of June, 1738, when it received the name Sturbridge.</P>
<P>This town is large in its dimen&s;ions, containing by actual &s;urvey, about 28929 acres. It is &s;ituat|ed in the &s;outhwe&s;t corner of the county, and is divided from Wood&s;tock and Union, on the &s;outh, in the &s;tate of Connecticut, by the &s;tate line; and bounded we&s;t, on Holland and Brimfield, in the county of Hamp&s;hire; on the north, by Brook|field; and on the ea&s;t, by Charlton and Dudley. The grant of this tract was made in the year 1729, in the month of Augu&s;t, but it was thought &s;carce|ly
<PB N="185" REF="026481_0184_0FD0570CB65FF3D0">
habitable by rea&s;on of its broken rough &s;tate; and the &s;oil, for the mo&s;t part, requiring hard and great labour to render it productive; but the fir&s;t &s;ettlers being a robu&s;t, re&s;olute, &s;ober and indu&s;|trious &s;et of men, were determined to get an hon|e&s;t living, by "the &s;weat of their faces," and, through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, they &s;oon converted this wilderne&s;s into a fruitful field. The original proprietors built a hou&s;e for the wor&s;hip of God, which was rai&s;ed on the 20th and 21&s;t days of June, 1733, and on the 3d of September following it was con&s;ecrated by the Rev. Jo&s;eph Baxter of Medfield, who preached from I&s;aiah lxiii, and 5th. From that time the place increa&s;ed fa&s;t in the number of good and indu&s;trious people, who very quickly obtained to live comfortably; and like others of that age, early &s;ought for a teacher of piety and morality. On the 29th of September, 1736, the Rev. Caleb Rice was ordained to the pa&s;toral office over the church and flock of God in the place. He was a pa&s;tor after God's heart; &s;ound in faith; a good preacher, endued with ex|cellent mini&s;terial gifts, and very exemplary in life, as well as &s;ocial and benevolent in his deport|ment. He lived in great harmony with his peo|ple, in the fore part of his mini&s;try: But about the year 1747, a number of the brethren and in|habitants, conceiving they had received <HI>new light,</HI> different from what was common among their neighbours, &s;eparated from him, which rendered his work more arduous, and his life uncomforta|ble. From &s;eparati&s;ts they became anabapti&s;ts:
<PB N="186" REF="026481_0185_0FD056E74BDDF6C0">
But it plea&s;ed the Great Head of the church to re|move Mr. Rice from his labours, by death, on the &s;econd of September, 1759, who&s;e prai&s;e was then through all the churches, and his memory is &s;till dear to many. He was &s;ucceeded in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, in the congregational church and &s;ociety in Sturbridge, by the Rev. Jo&s;hua Paine, who was &s;eparated hereunto on the 17th of June, 1761, and &s;till continues the faithful and beloved pa&s;tor thereof. The people here have &s;urpri&s;ingly flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed; for there are now about 1800 &s;ouls in the place. The con|gregational church is large, con&s;i&s;ting of about 150 members of both &s;exes. On the 29th and 30th days of June, 1785, they rai&s;ed a large new meetinghou&s;e, which is elegant and well fini&s;hed; in which the fir&s;t &s;ermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Paine on January 7th, 1786, from fir&s;t of Kings, viii. 27.</P>
<P>There is in the town a very re&s;pectable &s;ociety of anabapti&s;ts, compri&s;ing about one fifth part of the inhabitants. The&s;e al&s;o have built them late|ly a hand&s;ome meetinghou&s;e. As great peace and harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two &s;ocieties, as can well be expected under &s;uch circum&s;tances: Differ|ence of &s;entiments, as to modes and rites of religion, &s;carcely injures good neighbourhood; nor does it prevent their mixing in families, or friendly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial circles.</P>
<P>The inhabitants at pre&s;ent are indu&s;trious and frugal, charitable, and given to ho&s;pitality. The great precepts of the Chri&s;tian religion, moral vir|tue,

and the in&s;truction of their youth, they make their &s;tudy and care. They live in peace and love.</P>
<P>However hilly, rough and uneven the town was at fir&s;t, yet, by indu&s;try and frugality, the people are become wealthy, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting chiefly by the cul|tivation of the earth. By hard labour the &s;oil is become fruitful. It is good for orcharding and grazing. Much butter and chee&s;e are made here, e&s;pecially the former, which has obtained high credit in the markets. The land is pretty good for grain. The growth of wood is &s;imilar to that of the towns in the vicinity, oak of all &s;orts, walnut, che&s;nut, pine in con&s;iderable plenty, e&s;pecially in its earlier days; a&s;h, beech, birch, maple, elm, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The town is in general well watered by &s;prings, brooks, rivers and ponds. The River Quinebaug, which has its &s;ource in Brimfield, runs through this town near the centre, from we&s;t to ea&s;t. On this there are large bodies of good interval, and valuable meadow lands. There are valuable ponds in the town, well &s;tored with the u&s;ual &s;orts of fre&s;h water fi&s;h.</P>

<P>THE town of Holden was taken whol|ly from the town of Worce&s;ter, being included in their original grants; and was the northwe&s;terly part thereof.</P>
<P>It was incorporated on the 9th of January, 1740, when the name of Holden was given to it to perpet|uate the name and deeds of the Hon.

This town was &s;aid to be laid out &s;ix miles &s;quare, but it con&s;ider|ably exceeds that: From ea&s;t to we&s;t it is about &s;even miles acro&s;s: From the &s;outh point at Lei|ce&s;ter

<P>We go on to a Geographical De&s;cription of the town of Holden. The &s;oil of this town is &s;ome|what various, yet in general of a loamy kind: The land in the out&s;kirts of the town is the mo&s;t &s;pringy and natural to gra&s;s. The general pro|duce is rye, Indian corn, &s;pring wheat and oats. Some farms produce good barley. Flax is rai&s;ed with various &s;ucce&s;s; when there is a failure of a crop, it is generally owing to other cau&s;es than the nature of the &s;oil. Though the town is rather hilly and uneven, yet not very much &s;o. Such

land is generally good for fruit; and, according|ly, here are very large and valuable orchards in|deed, but they are chiefly at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance from the centre of the town; the middle not being &s;o fruitful, and more expo&s;ed to de&s;tructive fro&s;ts. There is a brickyard two miles and an half northea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e, where are made annually about &s;ixty thou&s;ands of bricks. The clay is very &s;trong and good. There are two pot|a&s;h works about three miles ea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e, one of them lately erected. The growth of wood in Holden is mainly che&s;nut and oak of all kinds. In former years there was a great quantity of ex|cellent white pine timber, but the mo&s;t of it has been cut off. There &s;till remains, chiefly in the northerly part of the town, con&s;iderable yellow pine. There are other kinds of wood in various parts of the town. Some walnut, hemlock, horn|beam, white maple, a&s;h, and &s;ome valuable rock|maple.</P>
<P>At the northwe&s;t part of the town there is a Pond called Quinepoxet, the greater part of which is in Princeton: A narrow fordable &s;trait of wa|ter i&s;&s;ues from this into a le&s;&s;er pond, perhaps fif|ty rods in length; from this there is an outlet in|to a &s;econd pond; from this &s;econd an outlet into a third; and from the third, into a fourth pond. The&s;e le&s;&s;er ponds are in Holden; and from them proceeds a river called Quinepoxet, which holds an ea&s;terly cour&s;e, and pa&s;&s;es out of Holden into Boyl&s;ton, where, quite on the we&s;t &s;ide of that town, it joins Still River which comes from the foot

<P>THIS town was taken from Lanca&s;ter, and was part of what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as called Lanca&s;ter new grant. It was incorporated on the 23d of June, 1740.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="026481_0192_0FD0572B891A7990">The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of Leomin&s;ter is as follows. The church here was imbodied on the 14th of September, 1743: And on the &s;ame day the Rev. John Rogers was ordained their pa&s;tor. He was a &s;en&s;ible, worthy man, and u&s;ed his nat|ural right to examine, think and believe, for him|&s;elf. And what he thought to be the truth as it is in Je&s;us, that he preached to his people; always appearing to act uprightly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly. However, a number of the church and people, ap|prehending Mr. Rogers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> doctrines con|trary to the go&s;pel, called in a larg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> council for advice in July 1757, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen churches. The council judged the brethren had rea&s;ons for di&s;&s;atisfaction, but advi&s;ed them to attend on Mr. Rogers's mini&s;try for three months, and if he did not retract his errors, as they called them, in that time, then they advi&s;ed the church to di&s;mi&s;s him; which they accordingly did, and &s;hut him out of the meetinghou&s;e. Upon this Mr. Rogers preach|ed to &s;uch as were di&s;po&s;ed to attend on his mini&s;|try, in his own hou&s;e. At length Mr. Rogers &s;ued the town for his &s;alary: And after a long conte&s;t in the law, the di&s;pute was compromi&s;ed in this manner, viz. Mr. Rogers relinqui&s;hed all claims upon the town as their mini&s;ter; the town to pay to Mr. Rogers whatever &s;ums of money his adher|ents had been obliged to pay towards &s;upplying the pulpit after he had been &s;hut out of it; and, finally, that all who wi&s;hed to have Mr. Rogers for their mini&s;ter, &s;hould be made a poll pari&s;h; about a fifth part of the town were accordingly
<PB N="194" REF="026481_0193_0FD04FF38AAE5448">
made a di&s;tinct, but poll pari&s;h, by an act of the Legi&s;lature; after this &s;ettlement of their unhappy controver&s;y, the church and town proceeded to the choice of a mini&s;ter, and on the 22d of December, 1762, the Rev. Francis Gardner was ordained their &s;econd pa&s;tor; in who&s;e mini&s;terial labours the people have been very happy for more than thirty years already; and during this period they have been peaceable and pro&s;perous. And when the town, a few years &s;ince, erected a large and elegant new meetinghou&s;e, Mr. Rogers's adherents con|tributed their full proportion to the building of it. The Rev. Mr. Rogers, having obtained help of God, continued to preach and admini&s;ter &s;pecial ordinances to the people of his pari&s;h until the year 1788, when, finding his age and bodily in|firmities &s;o great, he wi&s;hed to be excu&s;ed from the &s;acred labours, to which his people con&s;ented, and generou&s;ly paid him three years &s;alary in advance: Whereupon, by an act of the Legi&s;lature, this poll pari&s;h was di&s;&s;olved, and the whole town now form but one church and congregation under the mini&s;try of the Rev. Mr. Gardner.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Rogers lived but a little while after he cea&s;ed from his publick labours. He de|parted this life October, 1789, in the 47th year of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Let it now be ob&s;erved, there was no way to avoid giving this particular detail, and yet mention the two religious &s;ocieties which for a time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in Leomin&s;ter. Our plan, truth, and impartial ju&s;tice, required the mention of them. And
<PB N="195" REF="026481_0194_0FD0572D094F4D00">
nothing derogatory of any one has been &s;aid. Nay, the de&s;ign has been to pay tribute due to worthy characters, to Mr. Rogers and Mr. Gardner, and to the people, who once were two parties and &s;o|cieties. The majority of the church and town di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed Mr. Rogers, that the truth and purity of the go&s;pel, as they thought, might continue with them. The friends of Mr. Rogers &s;uppo&s;ed him to be a good and faithful mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and therefore adhered to him to the la&s;t; and treated him with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect, kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity, until the Great Head of the church was plea&s;ed to remove him from this world. And now he is gone to be here no more, we find the two &s;ocieties cordially receiving and embracing each other, and cheerfully attending upon and &s;up|porting one and the &s;ame mini&s;ter, the Rev. Mr. Gardner. The moral character of Mr. Rogers was never impeached. Had he lived in the pre&s;ent day, perhaps &s;uch a controver&s;y would never have been heard of. We have &s;een in Mr. Rogers a uniform character, and an hone&s;t upright man, who&s;e integrity, and firm attachment to what he thought were important truths, were &s;uperior to the trials he met with, and by which per&s;ons of more ea&s;y virtue might have been overcome.</P>
<P>Some Geographical De&s;cription of the town of Leomin&s;ter &s;hall here be pre&s;ented to the reader.

it is a little to the northwe&s;t at the di&s;tance of fifty miles. It is bounded on the north and north|ea&s;t, by Fitchburg and Lunenburg; on the ea&s;t, &s;outhea&s;t and &s;outh, by Lanca&s;ter; and on the &s;outhwe&s;t and we&s;t, by Sterling, and a gore of land. This town is pretty plain and level in the middle of it, and for a mile and a half or two miles round the meetinghou&s;e, and indeed all the way &s;outh of the meetinghou&s;e towards Lanca&s;ter; to the north, towards Fitchburg, it is not quite &s;o level; yet the land is pretty good, and the &s;oil is clayey: Upon the ea&s;t, and e&s;pecially on the we&s;t, the land becomes hilly and more uneven, and the land is proportionably better. The farms in the middle of the town, are by no means poor; but tho&s;e in the &s;kirts of the town are very excellent in|deed; and the land is equal to that in any town. The land is well adapted to all kinds of grain, and the hilly parts to gra&s;s and pa&s;turage; and the town abounds with famous orchards, and all kinds of fruit, and much cyder is made in the place. The land is not very &s;tony and rocky in general, ex|cept it be &s;ome particular part of &s;ome of the hills. Of the&s;e none are famous or worthy of particular notice, except one in the we&s;terly part of the town, called Wauhnoo&s;nook Hill; this is about two miles in length, and a mile or more from the meetinghou&s;e in the neare&s;t place: It is pretty high and &s;teep: And although there is &s;ome brok|en and unimproveable land upon it, yet there are many very fine farms thereon. This hill is famous for affording va&s;t quantities of mo&s;t excellent

&s;tone, of a grayi&s;h colour, pretty free, and ea&s;ily &s;plit and wrought, and &s;ome have natural faces, &s;ixteen, eighteen and twenty feet in length. This &s;tore is perhaps inexhau&s;tible. In the &s;outh part of the town there is a very large body of plain land covered with pitch pine; and there is con|&s;iderable white pine within the town. But the main growth of wood con&s;i&s;ts of oak of all kinds, che&s;nut in plenty, much walnut, elm, butternut, &s;hagbark, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The town is very well watered in every part, by numerous &s;prings and rivulets. There are two &s;treams which claim a particular mention: One is Wauhnoo&s;nook Brook, &s;o called from the hill of that name, as it originates at the foot of this hill, at the north end, and runs all along on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the hill, and on the we&s;terly &s;ide of the town, and finally falls into the river Na&s;haway. The other is the north branch of the river Na&s;ha|way, which coming in from Fitchburg, at the northwe&s;t angle of the town, runs about a mile ea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e, and at the &s;outhea&s;t angle of this town pa&s;&s;es into Lanca&s;ter. There is &s;ome good interval land on this river, but in many places the banks of it are high and very &s;teep. There is but very little meadow land in the town. On this river and the &s;treams there are two gri&s;t mills, five &s;aw mills, one oil mill, and clothiers' works very excellent. There are only a part of two ponds fall within the limits of this town, and the&s;e were mentioned in giving an account of Lunenburg.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="026481_0197_0FD04FF733E1BD00">It has been mentioned before that the &s;oil of this town is clayey. There are indeed va&s;t bodies of the be&s;t of clay in the town: And upwards of two hundred thou&s;ands of bricks are made here in a year. The&s;e bricks are &s;aid to endure the fire longer than any made in the county. The people of Leomin&s;ter live mo&s;tly by the cultivation of the earth; and their farms and buildings proclaim their indu&s;try, and indicate a good degree of wealth. They have all the mechanicks and trade&s;|men in common with other places. And be&s;ides, the manufacturing of combs is here e&s;tabli&s;hed, in two or three places, and the work is carried on to great perfection and profit. About twenty per|&s;ons work, more or le&s;s at this trade; about ten are con&s;tantly employed therein, and they manu|facture about &s;ix thou&s;and dozen in a year. Mr. Jotham John&s;on, a trader here, employs five men in this work, who make twenty five hundred doz|en per annum. Among the&s;e, is one who makes ivory combs, equally good perhaps, as any im|ported from any country. Here are &s;everal &s;tores and &s;hops filled with European, Ea&s;t, and We&s;t|india goods. There is much travel through this town, from the north part of the county of Hamp|&s;hire and of Worce&s;ter, by the way of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and from Vermont State, and the we&s;tern part of Newhamp&s;hire, by the way of Fitchburg; the&s;e roads unite in the northwe&s;terly part of Leomin|&s;ter, and come to the meetinghou&s;e, where they part again; one turns nearly ea&s;t, leading on through Harvard to Bo&s;ton; the other runs &s;outh,

bearing a little to the ea&s;t into Lanca&s;ter, and &s;o on to Bo&s;ton. The county road from Leomin&s;ter to Worce&s;ter runs &s;outhwe&s;terly through Sterling.</P>
<P>Leomin&s;ter is a growing, flouri&s;hing town; it &s;tands about the middle of the towns of the coun|ty in the proportion it pays to a &s;tate tax; and when the late cen&s;us was taken there were 166 dwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hou&s;es, and 1190 inhabitants in the place.</P>

<P>THIS town was taken from Brook|field Brimfield and Palmer, and was incorporated on the 16th of January 1741. In this place a congregational church was formed in the year 1743, and on the la&s;t of January, 1744, the Rev. I&s;aac Jones was ordained their fir&s;t pa&s;tor. He died July, 1784, in the 67th year of his age, and 41&s;t of his mini&s;try. Mr. Jones was &s;ucceeded in the &s;acred office by the Rev.

The left hand, or po&s;t road, bears a &s;outhwe&s;tern cour&s;e to Springfield. The town does not lie in a &s;quare and regular form.

The &s;oil is propitious to the cul|tivation of fruit trees of all kinds; and the height and uneven &s;urface of the lands; are a great &s;ecu|rity to the grain and fruit from fro&s;ts. We&s;tern has its proportion of unimproveable lands; &s;ome of which are dry and rocky; &s;ome almo&s;t en|tirely inacce&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of va&s;t ledges of rocks; yet almo&s;t all the unimproved and unim|proveable lands are covered with wood and timber. On the high lands grow che&s;nut, oak and walnut; and in the lower lands grow a&s;h, birch, maple, elm, pine, hemlock, &amp;c. &amp;c. We&s;tern is &s;ufficiently watered by &s;prings, brooks and rivulets, which run about in the valleys among the hills.</P>
<P>The river Quaboag, from Brookfield, enters this town on the northea&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ing through it about a mile we&s;t of the centre, goes out at the &s;outhwe&s;t angle, and falls into Chicabee. A great number of brooks and rivulets are emptied into Quaboag River in its cour&s;e through We&s;tern. Salmon were formerly taken from this river within the town; but now their cour&s;e is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tructed by &s;ever|al dams which extend acro&s;s it, for the accommo|dation of mills and other water works: However, the river and other &s;treams afford all the various kinds of fi&s;h which are common to fre&s;h water. About a mile from the centre of the town, are fix|ed on this river, two gri&s;t mills, one &s;aw mill, one &s;cythe mill, one fulling mill, and one forge; and

the town affords &s;ome ore for the &s;upply of the forge. Be&s;ides the manufactory of iron, there is no other which claims a particular mention, ex|cept it be that of &s;ilk. Several gentlemen are turn|ing their attention to the cultivation of mulberry trees. Col. Jo&s;eph Jones, from about thirty trees, has for three &s;ea&s;ons pa&s;t, fed upon an average a|bout 30,000 worms; their produce has been be|tween three and four pounds of raw &s;ilk annually. And when manufactured, after making all deduc|tions for labour and trouble, has yielded a clear profit yearly, of &s;ixty dollars, which is an annuity of two dollars per tree. A &s;ample of the &s;ewing &s;ilk, manufactured by Col. Jones, and pre&s;ented to the writer, is equal to any imported.</P>
<P>There have been &s;ome ve&s;tiges of the aboriginals di&s;covered on an exten&s;ive hill in the ea&s;terly part of this town, which was taken from Brookfield.

<P>This town is very flouri&s;hing, and is growing in number, and increa&s;ing in wealth. When the cen|&s;us was taken two years ago, there were 124 dwell|ing hou&s;es, and 900 inhabitants in the place.</P>

<P>THE General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts having granted &s;ix thou&s;and acres of land to cer|tain per&s;ons of the ancient town of Braintree, in the county of Suffolk, for &s;ervices by them done to the publick, it was called and known by the &s;tyle of Braintree Farms. This tract of land, together with a part of Brookfield, and a part of Hardwick, was incorporated January 31&s;t, 1751, and the name
<PB N="208" REF="026481_0207_0FD0571218EBF970">
Newbraintree was given to it. The people who fir&s;t &s;ettled this territory took early care for the &s;up|port of the go&s;pel, and the enjoyment of all the in&s;tituted means of religion; they accordingly erected a hou&s;e for the publick wor&s;hip of God, and on the 18th of April, 1754, the church of Chri&s;t in this place was imbodied, and the Rev. Benjamin Ruggles, their fir&s;t mini&s;ter, was in&s;tall|ed the &s;ame day. Mr. Ruggles had been, for a number of years before, mini&s;ter of the &s;econd pari&s;h in the town of Middleborough, in the county of Ply|mouth. The Rev.

The Rev. Mr. Ruggles died &s;uddenly, of an epilep&s;y, or apoplexy, Lord's day morning, May 12th, 1782, in the 82d year of his age, and the 62d of his pub|lick mini&s;try. There is but one religious &s;ociety in the town, nor any &s;ectaries excepting only two families of anabapti&s;ts. The fir&s;t meetinghou&s;e ever built here is now &s;tanding, and on a beauti|ful eminence in the centre of the town, from whence there is a very exten&s;ive pro&s;pect.

<P>We &s;hall now pre&s;ent a Geographical De&s;crip|tion of Newbraintree.</P>
<P>This town contains about 13000 acres of land, and is bounded &s;outh, on Brookfield; we&s;t, by Ware River, which &s;eparates it from Hardwick; north, on the town of Barre; and ea&s;t, on the towns of Oakham and Spencer: It lays much in a triangular form.</P>
<P>The town is neither remarkably hilly nor level; but agreeably inter&s;per&s;ed with moderate hills and valleys. There are two hills of name and note; one on the we&s;terly &s;ide of the town, and is &s;teep, with large ledges of rocks on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, called <HI>Rattle Snakes' Rocks,</HI> from the great number of tho&s;e venomous &s;erpents, which, in the infancy of the town, inhabited them; but their race is now almo&s;t extinct. The other is &s;ituated in the &s;outhea&s;terly part of the town, and is called <HI>Mo|hawk Hill.</HI> On the we&s;terly &s;ide of the town, is what is commonly called a plain, though not very level; its natural growth of wood is pitch pine; and it is excellent for grain, and good roads. The &s;oil of the town is in general rocky, moi&s;t, loamy and warm, and genial to wheat, rye, barley, oats, Indian corn, peas, flax, hemp, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is mo&s;t excellent for orcharding; and, for its bigne&s;s, rather exceeds, perhaps, any other town in the county in fine grazing lands, as is evinced by the
<PB N="210" REF="026481_0209_0FD057138D9D8CC8">
annual produce of the dairy and of beef. Before the &s;ettlement of this place, the fires made in the woods, had de&s;troyed almo&s;t the whole growth of timber; and it was feared there would be a &s;carcity; but by the care and prudence of the inhabitants there have, within a few years, &s;prung up fine groves of wood, and now there is a plen|ty. The common timber upon the upland, or hilly parts, is oak, walnut and che&s;nut; in the low lands, &s;wamps and mar&s;hes, there is maple, a&s;h, birch, hornbeam and &s;ome &s;pruce and hac|ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ack.</P>
<P>Newbraintree is very finely watered by rivers, brooks, rivulets and &s;prings. Ware River runs along on the we&s;t &s;ide of the town, and is the boundary between Hardwick and this place. On the we&s;terly &s;ide of the town there is al&s;o a large brook, called Meminimi&s;&s;et Brook, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orm|ed entirely by &s;prings from the adjacent hills, and running north empties it&s;elf into Ware Riv|er. On this brook there is an exten&s;ive and lux|uriant meadow of &s;everal hundreds of acres, call|ed Meminimi&s;&s;et, the name given to it by the In|dians when a hideous &s;wamp: This was the head quarters, and the chief place of rendezvous of the &s;avages, at the time when Brookfield was de|&s;troyed; and near which place eight brave men were killed, and three mortally wounded by the Indians, Augu&s;t 2d, 1675, as has been more par|ticularly related in the account of Brookfield: And hither Mrs. Rowland&s;on was carried captive, who was taken by the enemy at Lanca&s;ter, Febru|ary

<P>This meadow beforementioned produces exceed|ing great crops of mo&s;t excellent hay. At the ea&s;t|erly part of the town lie two very con&s;iderable tracts of meadow land, through which run two brooks which ari&s;e from &s;prings; the&s;e brooks, one of which carries a corn mill, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;aid meadows, and running near the &s;outh line of the town, unite, and then carry a &s;aw mill: This &s;tream then runs into the north part of Brookfield, and after &s;everal windings and meanderings, and carrying two more mills, it again vi&s;its the &s;outh part of this town, and runs through another large tract of excellent meadow, called Ditch Meadow, and carrying another corn mill in Newbraintree, it leaves the town, and falls into a large pond in the we&s;t pari&s;h in Brookfield, called Wickoboaug Pond. The air of this town is accounted good and &s;alubrious, and the people pro&s;per, flouri&s;h and increa&s;e. Excepting a few of the u&s;ual me|chanicks, and one or two traders in foreign goods, the people are farmers, and have the reputation of being good hu&s;bandmen, frugal and indu&s;trious, and they live much independent. According to the late enumeration the number of &s;ouls amount|ed to 940; and their hou&s;es are in general neat and commodious. This town is &s;ixty &s;ix miles from Bo&s;ton, a little to the &s;outh of we&s;t; and it is nineteen miles from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, a very little to the north of we&s;t.

<P>THE whole of this town was included in the original grant of Leice&s;ter. It was made a pari&s;h or precinct early in the year 1744, and was called the we&s;terly pari&s;h of Leice&s;ter, until its in|corporation on the 3d of April, 1753, when the name of Spencer was given to it. In this place a church was gathered May 17th, 1744; and over the flock of God in this place the Rev. Jo&s;hua Ea|ton was ordained November 7th, 1744, who con|tinued in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try until April 2d, 1772, when he died in the 28th year of his pa&s;torate. Mr. Eaton fir&s;t turned his atten|tion to the law, and was, for &s;everal years, an able and &s;kilful attorney in the county of Worce&s;ter, but cho&s;e at length to for&s;ake that gainful em|ployment, for the more high and honourable one of &s;erving God in the go&s;pel of his Son.

<P>Spencer is &s;aid to be eight miles in length, and four miles in breadth, on a &s;traight line. The town is con&s;iderably uneven, abounding in hills and val|leys, although there are no hills very high or large, or called by any particular names. It is an exceeding fertile town&s;hip, and the inhabitants are indu&s;trious, pro&s;perous and wealthy. It is be|come more numerous and opulent than the town from whence it was taken, as it is larger in lands, becau&s;e &s;everal years after the incorporation of Spencer, the northwe&s;terly part of Leice&s;ter was with the &s;outherly part of Rutland, &s;et off to form the town of Paxton.</P>
<P>This town is watered by many excellent peren|nial &s;treams which run through the &s;everal parts of it, &s;ome of which are &s;ufficient to carry mills, but none of them are large. There are three in the north|erly part; one proceeds from a large and fine pond, which lays partly in Spencer and partly in Rut|land, called Browning's Pond: Its cour&s;e, for &s;ever|al miles, is &s;outherly. Another to the ea&s;tward of it, has its &s;ource in Rutland, and runs for &s;ome miles in the &s;ame direction with the former. A third i&s;|&s;ues from a pond in the north part of Leice&s;ter; and running a we&s;terly cour&s;e for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, then unites with the &s;econd; after this junction, turning &s;outhwe&s;t, they fall in with the fir&s;t men|tioned &s;tream.

&s;till being &s;outhwe&s;terly, they are emptied into Podunk Pond, &s;o called, in Brookfield; whence i&s;|&s;ues a river which runs into Chicabee River, which falls into Connecticut river, in the north part of Springfield. There are al&s;o in the &s;outh part of this town, two &s;treams, one of which uniting with the &s;treams mentioned above, falls into Connecti|cut river; the other running &s;outherly, falls in with French River, which is emptied into the &s;ea at Newlondon, in the &s;outhea&s;t angle of the State of Connecticut. All the&s;e &s;treams have one or more mills &s;tanding on them. There are likewi&s;e in Spencer, two clothiers' works, where much bu&s;i|ne&s;s is performed to great publick advantage; al|&s;o, there are two pota&s;h and pearla&s;h works.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in the town is of the u&s;ual various &s;orts. On the high lands, oak, walnut and che&s;nut are the chief. The &s;wamps are cov|ered generally with maple, birch and elm. In the infancy of the town, there was a large quantity of excellent pine timber, but this is mainly worked up.</P>
<P>The number of the people in Spencer, accord|ing to the late cen&s;us, was computed at 1322, and the number of hou&s;es was 192.</P>

<HEAD>PETERSHAM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was an original grant made by the General Court, in the clo&s;e of the year 1732, or beginning of 1733, to John Bennett, Jeremiah Perley, and others, as a compen&s;ation for &s;ervices performed by them in the Indian wars, under a Capt. John White of Lanca&s;ter. The fir&s;t meet|ing of the grantees was held on the 10th of May, 1733. Some time after the grant was made, to quiet the Indians who claimed the &s;oil, the pro|prietors made them a &s;atisfactory con&s;ideration therefor. It is rather more than &s;ix miles &s;quare. It had been a &s;eat for Indians, and was called ma|ny years by its Indian name, which was <HI>Nichewaug;</HI> and in the &s;outh part of the town lies <HI>Nichewaug Hill,</HI> &s;o called by the natives, whereon, as in &s;ome other parts of the town, they had formerly plant|ed fields of Indian corn, of which there remained evident traces when the fir&s;t Engli&s;h &s;ettlers began there.</P>

meetinghou&s;e, and &s;o early as the year 1738, they contracted with and &s;ettled a mini&s;ter for the in|habitants, and who was &s;upported by them until its incorporation. Although the pro&s;pects from the &s;oil were very promi&s;ing, and &s;ettlers moved in fa&s;t, yet they laboured under many and exceeding great di&s;advantages, being then &s;o remote from any white people, from whom they could procure the nece&s;&s;aries of life, or derive any aid and &s;up|port. While in its infancy, and &s;truggling for life, &s;o early as 1744, a French war broke out, and the Indians, being always in the intere&s;t of the French, they became ho&s;tile, and began to commit depredations in various parts of the land, which occa&s;ioned the few inhabitants great fear, terror and danger, obliging them to build forts in different parts of the town, round certain hou&s;es, into each of which a number of families moved for &s;afety and defence, and &s;oldiers were &s;tationed there as a guard to the inhabitants, and to recon|noitre the country. The people u&s;ed to labour on their lands, in &s;mall parties, changing works with one another, having their guns by them, and the&s;e al&s;o they were, for a long time, obliged to carry with them whenever they went to the hou&s;e of God for religious wor&s;hip, and al&s;o to place centinels at the doors. But although they were often alarmed, yet no white per&s;on was ever known to be killed in the place, When peace was &s;ettled between England and France, and dan|ger and fear from the Indians cea&s;ed, the &s;ettlement of the plantation went on very rapidly, and the peo|ple

were become &s;o numerous and able, as that the place was incorporated with all town privileges April 20th, 1754, and received the name of Pe|ter&s;ham. The church of Chri&s;t in this place was gathered, and their fir&s;t mini&s;ter, the Rev.

Here they have lately erected a large and elegant meetinghou&s;e, &s;tanding on a mo&s;t con&s;picuous &s;ituation, &s;o as to be &s;een from divers of the contiguous towns; &s;oon after it was built, Mr. Eleazar Brad&s;haw, now of Brook|field, made them a pre&s;ent of a large bell, the weight whereof is 913<ABBR>lb</ABBR>, and the co&s;t thereof was 96<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> So noble and publick &s;pirited a deed, ought to be perpetuated for the honour of the do|nor, and to &s;timulate others to like generous acts.</P>
<P>This town is thought by &s;ome to be the plea&s;|ante&s;t, for an inland town, of any in the State, af|fording to the eye, a general, exten&s;ive, and agree|ably variegated pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The land in this place is exceedingly favourable to the growth of all kinds of fruit trees, being high and warm; and here are large and excellent or|chards, and much cyder is made here, beyond what the inhabitants con&s;ume; but they find a ready market for the &s;urplus in the newer &s;ettle|ments. Having mentioned their fine orchards, I would duly notice one very remarkable natural curio&s;ity relative to this &s;ubject. There is now growing in an orchard, lately belonging to my honoured father, the Rev. Aaron Whitney, decea&s;|ed, an appletree, very &s;ingular with re&s;pect to its fruit. The apples are fair and when fully ripe

of a yellow colour, but evidently of different ta&s;tes, &s;our and &s;weet. The part which is &s;our is not very tart, nor the other very &s;weet. Two apples, grow|ing &s;ide by &s;ide, on the &s;ame limb, will be of the&s;e different ta&s;tes, the one all &s;our, and the other all &s;weet: And which is more remarkable, the &s;ame apple will be &s;our on one &s;ide, end, or part, and the other &s;weet; and that not in any order or uni|formity; nor is there any difference in the ap|pearance of the one part from the other. And as to the quantity, &s;ome have more of the acid, and le&s;s of the &s;weet, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Neither are the apples &s;o different in their ta&s;tes, peculiar to any particular branches, but are found promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly on any and every branch of the tree. The tree &s;tands almo&s;t in the mid&s;t of a large orchard in a rich and &s;trong &s;oil, and was tran&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anted there about fifty years ago. There is no appear|ance of the trunk, or any of the branches having been ingrafted or inoculated. It was a number of years after it had borne fruit, before the&s;e different ta&s;tes were noticed; but &s;ince they were fir&s;t di&s;covered, which is upwards of thirty years, there has been con&s;tantly the &s;ame variety ob&s;erved in the ta&s;te of the fruit of this tree. For the truth of the above account, an appeal may be made to many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and of nice ta&s;tes, who have trav|elled a great di&s;tance to view the tree and ta&s;te the fruit; but to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of an effect &s;o much out of the common cour&s;e of nature, mu&s;t, I think, be attended with difficulty. The only &s;o|lution I can conceive is, that the corcula, or hearts

<P>The &s;oil is rich and fertile, and the lands bear all kinds of grain, but mo&s;t natural to gra&s;s and pa&s;turage, and from the appearance and face of the town, we mu&s;t judge the inhabitants to be in|du&s;trious and wealthy, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t mainly by the cultivation of the earth. Though the town lies very high, yet the land is not dry, but &s;tony and moi&s;t, abounding with &s;prings and brooks of wa|ter; there are, however, but two noticeable &s;treams: Swift River, which ri&s;es from &s;prings in Gerry, runs to the &s;outhwe&s;t, through the ea&s;t|erly and &s;outherly part of Peter&s;ham, into the northwe&s;t part of Hardwick.</P>
<P>We&s;t Brook, a con&s;iderable &s;tream, ri&s;es in the northwe&s;terly part of the town, and runs through all the we&s;t &s;ide of it, and then enters Greenwich, in the county of Hamp&s;hire. On each of the&s;e there are both corn and &s;aw mills, and clothiers' works; and by the &s;ides of both there are con&s;id|erable bodies of good meadow land. Here are works for making pot and pearl a&s;h, where much bu&s;ine&s;s is profitably carried on, and many per&s;ons employed. On the high lands the growth of wood is oak, more che&s;nut, and a great deal of walnut of later years. In the &s;wamps and low
<PB N="221" REF="026481_0220_0FD05740C4105820">

<P>This town is &s;ituated &s;ixty &s;ix miles from Bo&s;|ton, nearly we&s;t, and about twenty eight miles from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter to the northwe&s;t, and is bounded on the north, by Athol; on the ea&s;t, by Gerry and Barre; on the &s;outh, by Barre and Hardwick; and on the we&s;t, by Greenwich and New&s;alem, in the county of Hamp&s;hire.</P>

<P>THIS town was taken wholly from Oxford, and was the we&s;terly part thereof: It was incorporated November 2d, 1754, and then receiv|ed its pre&s;ent name.</P>
<P>As much of the land in Charlton lies in the hands of the original proprietors, its &s;ettlement was greatly retarded for many years. However, in April, 1761, the congregational church here was imbodied, and the Rev. Caleb Curtis was &s;olemn|ly ordained to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try in this place, on the 15th of October, 1761. He con|tinued their pa&s;tor fifteen years, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office by a mutual council, October 29th, 1776. The people remained de&s;titute of a &s;ett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d mini&s;ter upwards of &s;ix years, until January 8th, 1783, when the Rev. Archibald Campbell was

in&s;talled their pa&s;tor. This Mr. Campbell was ordained pa&s;tor of the church and congregation in Ea&s;ton, in the county of Bri&s;tol, on the 17th of Augu&s;t, 1763, where he continued nineteen years, being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;toral relation to that people, Augu&s;t 11th, 1782. Mr. Campbell con|tinued in the pa&s;toral office in Charlton, until A|pril 9th, 1793, when he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by council, at his &s;pecial reque&s;t.</P>
<P>There is a large anabapti&s;t church and &s;ociety in this town, but at pre&s;ent they are de&s;titute of a &s;ettled mini&s;ter, as well as the congregational church and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>We proceed to a Topographical De&s;cription of Charlton.</P>
<P>This town was not in high repute at fir&s;t, and was thought by &s;ome to be hardly worth &s;ettling upon: As it was very rough in its natural &s;tate, and hard to &s;ubdue. But &s;uch land is almo&s;t al|ways found to be &s;trong and to wear well. This being the ca&s;e with Charlton, from &s;mall begin|nings and an incon&s;iderable figure, it has ri&s;en up, in the &s;pace of thirty or forty years, to renown a|mong the towns of the county. It is computed to be nearly &s;even miles &s;quare, being much larger in extent than Oxford from whence it was taken, and in general a better tract of land. The peo|ple are become very numerous, there being 1965 &s;ouls in the place when the cen&s;us was taken in the year 1791, which is more by &s;everal hundreds than any town in the county, except Brookfield, Sutton and Worce&s;ter, and it is become exceedingly

wealthy, as in the la&s;t State tax there were but &s;ix towns which paid more. There are 300 dwelling hou&s;es in the town. The people &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by the cultivation of the earth; and they have great encouragement to labour, for the &s;oil is &s;trong and rich, and the lands are fertile and very productive: Here they rai&s;e grain of all kinds in plenty; beef and pork are fatted; butter and chee&s;e are made in quantities equal to, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ing any other town in the county. The lands are well and nat|urally adapted to orcharding and fruit of all kinds. The hills are moi&s;t and &s;pringy; the hills and val|leys are well proportioned and agreeably inter|&s;per&s;ed. The town is well watered by &s;prings, brooks and rivulets, none of which claim particu|lar mention: But there is one large river in the we&s;tern part of the town, near to Sturbridge, which runs from the north to the &s;outh, and is called Quinebaug. This river is almo&s;t an inconceivable advantage, not to Charlton only, but to many ad|jacent towns, by &s;upplying great plenty of water for all the mills and water works in the drie&s;t &s;ea|&s;ons. On this river, within the limits of Charlton, there are &s;ome rich interval, and good meadow lands.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal hills in this town worthy of particular mention; one by the name of Ponnakin. Another called <HI>Ma&s;hymuggett</HI>; this is high, for on its &s;ummit buildings in about twelve adjacent towns may be di&s;cerned. This hill is &s;ituated a|bout three quarters of a mile from the congrega|tional meetinghou&s;e. There is a third, known by
<PB N="224" REF="026481_0223_0FD0571E0AD7C990">
the name of <HI>Blood's Hill.</HI> The fourth and la&s;t we &s;hall mention, is called Craige's Hill.</P>
<P>There are no ponds in the town worthy of no|tice, nor mines or minerals as yet di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The wood and timber which grow in Charlton is white, black, and red oak, and walnut and che&s;|nut in great plenty; &s;ome white pine, and &s;ome pitch pine: In the low lands there is a&s;h, birch, maple, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Charlton there are a few dealers in Europe|an and India goods, as is u&s;ual in country towns; and they have al&s;o all the common trade&s;men and mechanicks. But there are two tanners in the town to be noticed, who carry on their bu&s;ine&s;s to a very con&s;iderable degree, and in the mo&s;t advan|tageous manner, viz. Capt. I&s;rael Waters, and Mr. A&s;a Corben; and e&s;pecially the former, in the northerly part, who carries on his work to great perfection. He has an excellent bark mill, car|ried by water, and upon a new con&s;truction, whereby he grinds all his bark. On the &s;ame &s;tream, a little below, there is a gin &s;till, a brew|ery, malt hou&s;e and corn mill, under the &s;ame roof, the property of Mr. Eli Wheelock, who erected &s;aid works in the year 1792, and where he carries on each branch of bu&s;ine&s;s very largely to his own and the publick intere&s;t. On the &s;ame &s;tream there are &s;everal gri&s;t and &s;aw mills, and other water works, and mo&s;t of the mechanicks live in this north part of the town. There are al&s;o a number of pot and pearl a&s;h works in different parts of the town, where large quantities of pot and

In the year 1728, application was made to the General Court for a reward for &s;ervices done in the Narragan&s;et war, and the Court immed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly granted two town&s;hips of &s;ix miles &s;quare.

Being &s;o numerous, two town&s;hips were judged inadequate; and upon further application, the Court granted five town&s;hips more in 1732, a&s;&s;igning one hundred and twenty proprietors to each, on condition, that &s;ixty families be &s;ettled in each place, with a mini&s;ter, in the &s;pace of &s;even years from the date of the grant, re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n each, one right for the fir&s;t mini&s;ter, one for the mini&s;try, and one for the &s;chool; the government to be at the expen&s;e of laying ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the town&s;hips.</P>
<P>The whole &s;ociety of petitioners, or claiman's, met at Bo&s;ton on the com|mon, June, 1732, and, dividing them&s;elves into &s;even cla&s;&s;es, agreed to draw lots for the town&s;hips. A committee of the General Court laid out the town&s;hips, and numbered them. No. 1. was located back of Saco and Scarborough.

<P><PB N="226" REF="026481_0225_0FD0571F8E8B09A8">The fir&s;t meeting of the proprietors of this grant (who con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the inhabitants of Cambridge, Charle&s;town, Watertown, We&s;ton, Sud|bury, Newton, Medford, Malden and Reading) was held December 3d, 1733, when all officers were cho&s;en nece&s;&s;ary to manage the affairs of the proprietors. The fir&s;t committee of the proprie|tors of Narragan&s;et No. 2, were John Cutting, James Lowden, and Jo&s;eph Bowman. From this time, to the year 1737, little was done to forward the &s;ettlement of the place. In March this year, Capt. Fairbanks Moor moved his family into it. He was the fir&s;t planter. In June, Deacon Jo&s;eph Holden moved his family into the place. The&s;e two families contained fifteen &s;ouls. It being an expo&s;ed plantation, &s;ettlers moved in but &s;lowly. In the year 1739, the proprietors erected a decent meetinghou&s;e, which was dedicated at a proprie|tors' meeting, June 6, 1739. The few &s;ettlers were de&s;irous of, and forward for &s;ettling a min|i&s;ter; accordingly, on the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1742, they made choice of Mr. Eli&s;ha Mar&s;h, in which
<PB N="227" REF="026481_0226_0FD0574507674380">
the proprietors concurred. The church of Chri&s;t in this place was formed, and the Rev. Eli&s;ha Mar&s;h was ordained their fir&s;t mini&s;ter October 20th, 1742. Mr. Mar&s;h continued with them but a few years. An unhappy controver&s;y ari&s;ing be|tween him and the people, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;toral office, 1757. Mr. Mar&s;h was afterwards Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, in the coun|ty of Che&s;hire, in the State of Newhamp&s;hire; and died but a few years &s;ince, at Lanca&s;ter, being on a journey.</P>
<P>The town remained in a broken &s;tate until Oc|tober 16th, 1765, when the Rev. A&s;aph Rice was con&s;ecrated pa&s;tor, the &s;econd in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of the church and congregation here, and &s;till continues in that office; and in peace and love with his people.</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to his &s;ettlement in We&s;tmin&s;ter, Mr. Rice had been a mi&s;&s;ionary among the Indians.</P>
<P>At the time of Mr. Mar&s;h's ordination, the place was in its infancy, few in number, &s;truggling for life, and expo&s;ed to Indian depredations, and its population went on &s;lowly. About the year 1743, the General Court granted 400<HI>l.</HI> to fortify the place, with which ten forts were erected, and &s;oldiers &s;tationed there for the defence of the inhab|itants. In 1746, &s;ome of the people of the place were put under pay, as a town &s;cout. From 1744, to the clo&s;e of the year 1748, the &s;ettlers met with great di&s;couragements, and endured &s;evere trials, although no per&s;on in the place was ever cut off by the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="026481_0227_0FD05721078B6198">After that period, the people increa&s;ed, and the place flouri&s;hed exceedingly, &s;o that in the &s;pace of half a century, notwith&s;tanding their dangers, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and difficulties, and the &s;mallne&s;s of their fir&s;t number, only fifteeen &s;ouls, they have &s;pread and extended their branches, and covered the town, and are become a great people, as at this day; having, when the cen&s;us was taken in 1791, 177 dwelling hou&s;es, and 1176 inhabitants. The original grant was &s;ix miles &s;quare; however, the mea&s;ure was rather large, for by actual &s;urvey, in|cluding ponds, rivers, &amp;c. it contained 27000 acres; but of late, 7000 acres of land, with the inhabitants thereof, were &s;et off to aid in forming the town of Gardner, to the northwe&s;t. This town is &s;till large, and is bounded on the we&s;t and the northwe&s;t by Gardner, on the north by A&s;hburnham; on the northea&s;t by Fitchburg; on the ea&s;t, by &s;ome farms not belonging to any town; on the &s;outh by Princeton; and on the &s;outhwe&s;t, by Hubbard&s;ton.</P>
<P>We&s;tmin&s;ter is &s;ituated on the height of land be|tween the rivers Merrimack and Connecticut, having &s;treams ari&s;ing in the town, and running into both. The town is inter&s;per&s;ed with hills and valleys; and with &s;prings, brooks and rivu|lets, very convenient for watering the land, and for carrying of mills. The northwe&s;terly part of Watchu&s;ett hill falls within the limits of this town. And what is called the middle of the place, or centre of the town, is a large and high hill, the top of which is nearly level; this is a &s;quare of

&s;ix acres, left by the proprietors, as a convenient place for a training field, and for the meeting|hou&s;e. A little north of the centre of this &s;quare &s;tands their new, large and elegant meetinghou&s;e, directly in front of which pa&s;&s;es the great road from Connecticut River to Bo&s;ton. At the &s;outh|ea&s;t angle of this &s;quare &s;tands an elegant hou&s;e belonging to the Hon. Judge Gill; on the we&s;ter|ly &s;ide of the &s;quare &s;tands the mini&s;ter's hou&s;e. On the &s;ides of this &s;quare are &s;hops well &s;tored with Engli&s;h and We&s;tindia goods. In the town they have all the u&s;ual trade&s;men and me|chanicks. Here al&s;o are three gri&s;t mills, three &s;aw mills, one oil mill, one fulling mill, one clothiers' works, and one trip hammer; al&s;o works for cutting nails, and works for the manufacture of iron are now erecting. The &s;oil of this town is &s;trong, rich and fertile; the high lands are well &s;tored with &s;tones, &s;uitable and &s;ufficient for wall|ing in the farms, and are good for orcharding, and almo&s;t all kinds of fruit. Here are lands for the various purpo&s;es of mowing, ploughing and pa&s;tur|ing. And the town has been, and &s;till is well fur|ni&s;hed with wood. The high lands have all &s;orts of oak, &s;ome che&s;nut, &s;ome walnut, which is in|crea&s;ing; they have had great plenty of white p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, which is chiefly cut off; &s;ome yellow and pitch pine: The low lands are &s;tored with a&s;h, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ech birch, maple, and hemlock.</P>
<P>There are four ponds within the town, one called Watchu&s;ett Pond, lies at the foot of that hill, on the northerly &s;ide. The line of the town cro&s;&s;es

this pond, leaving part thereof in Princeton; this is of con&s;iderable bigne&s;s, and well repleni&s;hed with fre&s;h water fi&s;h. A &s;tream i&s;&s;ues from the northwe&s;terly end of this pond, and runs norther|ly through the ea&s;terly part of We&s;tmin&s;ter, re|ceiving &s;everal &s;treams in its cour&s;e; and leaving the town it runs in a northea&s;terly direction into Fitchburgh, forming a con&s;iderable branch of the Na&s;haway, or Lanca&s;ter River.

There is a &s;tream ari&s;ing in another body of meadow land, which falls into this pond, on its &s;outhwe&s;terly &s;ide.

Pond. The fourth pond is in the northern border of the town: No &s;tream of any con&s;equence runs into it; a &s;mall one i&s;&s;ues from it, and running &s;outh, falls into a large &s;tream, which ri&s;es in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and running ea&s;terly, is known by the name of North River; and continuing an ea&s;t|ern direction, unites with the &s;tream which comes from Watchu&s;ett Pond. There is another &s;tream, called the Mo&s;t Northerly River, which ri&s;es in A&s;hburnham, and running through the northerly part of We&s;tmin&s;ter, receives various brooks and rivulets in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and helps to form the northerly branch of the river Na&s;haway. The la&s;t &s;tream which de&s;erves our notice, is called Otter River, which i&s;&s;uing from a &s;wamp or low land in Hubbard&s;ton, runs northerly, through the we&s;ter|ly part of We&s;tmin&s;ter, into Gardner, receiving &s;everal &s;treams in its way, then turning, runs we&s;t|erly through the north part of Templeton, Athol, Warwick, and the &s;outherly part of Northfield, and falls into Connecticut River. This &s;tream unites with Miller's River in Winchendon, as may be &s;een more particularly in the de&s;cription of Templeton.</P>
<P>We&s;tmin&s;ter is large, and become populous, and is continually increa&s;ing in number and wealth. It is &s;ituated about fifty five miles from Bo&s;ton, a little to the north of we&s;t, and about twenty two miles from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;|ter, nearly north.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCETON.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 20th of October, 1759, the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts pa&s;&s;ed an act for incorporating the ea&s;t wing, &s;o called, of Rutland, together with &s;undry farms, and &s;ome publick lands, contiguous thereto; and gave the place the name of Princeton, to perpetuate the name and memory of the late Rev. Thomas Prince, colleague pa&s;tor of the old &s;outh church in Bo&s;ton, and a large proprietor of this tract of land, who&s;e daugh|ter and only &s;urviving child the Hon. Judge Gill married for his fir&s;t wife.</P>
<P>The town contained about 19000 acres: And at the time of its incorporation there were about twenty families in the place. It was in the month of May, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the year 1751, when Mr. Robert Keyes, now living, removed with his family from Shrew&s;bury, and fixed down near the foot of Wat|chu&s;ett hill, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, being the fourth fami|ly which &s;ettled in the place. Upon the 14th of April, 1755, a child of his, named Lucy, aged four years and eight months, attempting, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, to follow her &s;i&s;ters, who had gone to Watchu&s;ett Pond, about a mile di&s;tant, and having nothing but marked trees to guide her, wandered out of her way in the woods, and was never heard of afterwards. The people for nearly thirty miles round collected immediately, and in companies traver&s;|ed

the woods, day after day and week after week, &s;earching for her, but never made the lea&s;t di&s;cov|ery. Many journeys were taken by the father, in con&s;equence of reports, but all in vain. Various were, and have been the conjectures of people re|&s;pecting the fate of this child. Divers concurring circum&s;tances render the following mo&s;t probable, that &s;he was taken by the Indians, and carried into their country, and &s;oon forgat her relations, lo&s;t her native language, and became as one of the aborigines.</P>
<P>Let us return to Princeton. The people who had &s;ettled in this town laboured at fir&s;t under very great difficulties, by rea&s;on of the mountain|ous, rocky, and naturally moi&s;t &s;tate of their lands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom want of pa&s;&s;able roads, and by rea&s;on of the prodigious quantities of heavy timber with which the ground was covered, (&s;ure indications of a rich and fertile &s;oil,) however, they attended to their roads, and increa&s;ed in number, and on the 30th of June, 1762, rai&s;ed the frame of their pre&s;ent meeting|hou&s;e, hired preaching, and were attentive to their religious intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>On the 12th of Augu&s;t, 1764, the church of Chri&s;t was imbodied in this town, and after vari|ous fruitle&s;s attempts to &s;ettle a mini&s;ter, the Rev. Timothy Fuller was ordained their fir&s;t pa&s;tor on the 9th of September, 1767. In about eight years a general di&s;affection to Mr. Fuller took place, which ended in a di&s;&s;olution of the pa&s;toral rela|tion between him and the people of Princeton on the 19th of April, 1776. Various attempts for a re&s;ettlement of the go&s;pel mini&s;try were un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful,
<PB N="234" REF="026481_0233_0FD05725879DB8E8">
until the 28th of June, 1786, when the Rev. Thomas Crafts was ordained pa&s;tor of the church and flock of God in this place. In the &s;pace of a|bout three years, Mr. Crafts's health failed, and for nearly two years he was unable to preach, when all hope of his being recovered, &s;o as to carry on the work of the &s;acred mini&s;try being cut off, the pa&s;|toral relation between him and his people was am|icably di&s;&s;olved at his &s;pecial reque&s;t, on the 14th of March, 1791. The people remain without a &s;ettled mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>In Princeton they have a very hand&s;ome &s;ocial library e&s;tabli&s;hed, of the value of upwards of 70<HI>l.</HI> ten pounds whereof were given by the Hon. Judge Gill.</P>
<P>In a little more than thirty years from its incor|poration, Princeton is become very con&s;iderable among the towns of the county. It has &s;urpri&s;|ingly increa&s;ed in number and wealth. When the cen&s;us was taken in 1791, there were 144 dwelling hou&s;es, and 1016 inhabitants in the place. The &s;oil being excellent, people had ev|ery encouragement from that con&s;ideration, to &s;et|tle and cultivate the lands; and their farms are mo&s;t|ly large and good. The land is naturally moi&s;t and &s;pringy, hilly and rocky, exceedingly well adapted to pa&s;turage, and the growth of Engli&s;h gra&s;s: Hence the fine&s;t of beef is fatted here, and va&s;t quantities of butter and chee&s;e are produced in the town: Some parts of the place afford grain in plenty; and from the appearance of their build|ings and farms, we mu&s;t judge the people are very

indu&s;trious. Many of their hou&s;es are large and elegant.</P>
<P>This leads to a particular mention, that in this town is the country &s;eat of the Hon. Mo&s;es Gill, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who has been from the year 1775 one of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Worce&s;ter, and for &s;everal years a Coun|&s;ellor of this Commonwealth. His noble and ele|gant &s;eat is about one mile and a quarter from the meetinghou&s;e, to the &s;outh. The farm contains upwards of 3000 acres. The county road from Princeton to Worce&s;ter pa&s;&s;es through it, in front of the hou&s;e, which faces to the we&s;t. The build|ings &s;tand upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e highe&s;t land of the whole farm; but it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> level round about them for many rods, and then there is a very gradual de|&s;cent. The lands on which the&s;e buildings &s;tand, are elevated between 1200 and 1300 feet above the level of the &s;ea, as the Hon. James Winthrop, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> informs me. The man&s;ion hou&s;e is large, being fifty by fifty feet, with four &s;tacks of chim|nies: The farm hou&s;e is forty feet by thirty &s;ix: In a line with this &s;tand the coach and chai&s;e hou&s;e fifty feet by thirty &s;ix: This is joined to the barn by a &s;hed &s;eventy feet in length&mdash;the barn is two hundred feet by thirty two. Very elegant fences are erected around the man&s;ion hou&s;e, the outhou&s;es, and the garden.</P>

<P>The hills of Princeton merit a particular de|&s;cription; they are three. Fir&s;t, <HI>Pine Hill,</HI> &s;itu|ated about two miles from the centre of the town, contains perhaps about thirty acres, and is mo&s;t|ly unimproveable; but its bowels afford a very great quantity of mo&s;t excellent &s;tones for build|ings, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, is Little Watchu&s;ett Hill, this is &s;it|uated near the centre of the town, perhaps half a mile di&s;tant, to the northward. This contains 237 acres, chiefly pa&s;turing; though &s;ome parts of it, being ledgy and mountainous, are unim|proveable.</P>
<P>The third, is the Great Watchu&s;ett Hill, or Mountain. This is &s;ituated about two miles from Princeton meetinghou&s;e, to the north; the north|we&s;terly part hereof falls within the limits of We&s;tmin&s;ter. This is an exceedingly high moun|tain, and is &s;ome of the fir&s;t land di&s;covered by people on board ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, when making for any of the &s;ea ports in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; and it is to be &s;een from the higher lands, in a greater part of the towns in the Commonwealth, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e between the &s;ea and Connecticut river. It contains &s;even or eight hundred acres; about four hundred acres of which being the &s;ummit, and be|ing province land, were given to the Rev. Mr.

The highe&s;t part of the mountain is a flat rock, or a ledge of rocks, for &s;ome rods round, and there is a &s;mall pond of water generally upon the top of it, of two or three rods &s;quare; and where there is any earth, it is covered with blueberry bu&s;hes for acres round; and as you de&s;cend the hill, there are very low and &s;mall trees, with flat tops, like tho&s;e on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ea &s;hore, occa&s;ioned no doubt, in part, by the &s;tate of the air; for it is &s;everal degrees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">older, at any time, on the top than at the bottom of the mountain; the further you de&s;cend, the taller are the trees, until they become of the common &s;ize.

<P>This town is exceedingly well watered by &s;prings and rivulets, as is generally the ca&s;e with hilly, rocky land; but there are no &s;treams of any great bigne&s;s, although &s;everal large and fine rivers have their &s;ources here. One branch of the Na&s;haway begins at the foot of Watchu&s;ett Hill, and runs through Sterling and Boyl&s;ton to Lan|ca&s;ter. Pi&s;s River, &s;o called, &s;prings up at the foot of this mountain, on the we&s;terly &s;ide, and runs through Hubbard&s;ton, and joins Ware River. There are &s;everal places in the town where &s;prings i&s;&s;ue and the waters divide, running &s;ome into Mer|rimack, &s;ome into Connecticut river. There is but little meadow land in Princeton, when com|pared with towns in general, but there are con&s;id|erable tracts of interval which afford good hay; however, the greate&s;t part of their hay is produced from upland mowing. There are two ponds on|ly in this town, or rather a part of two: Watchu|&s;ett Pond, about three miles north from the meet|inghou&s;e, at the north end of that mountain; it covers about one hundred acres, only about twen|ty of which are in Princeton, the greater part in We&s;tmin&s;ter. It is fed by &s;prings from the hill; its outlet is in We&s;tmin&s;ter. Quinepoxet Pond is &s;ituated in the &s;outhwe&s;t part of the town, &s;ome of which falls within the limits of Holden. It contains perhaps &s;eventy or eighty acres. Its in|lets are &s;everal &s;mall &s;treams; its outlet is the

<P>The town remained de&s;titute of a &s;ettled pa&s;tor until November 21&s;t, 1787, when the Rev. Jo&s;eph E&s;tabrook, was &s;olemnly &s;eparated unto the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Rev. Mr. Humphrey.</P>
<P>There are about ten families of anabapti&s;ts in this town, but there is no church, nor any &s;tated teacher of this denomination in the place: There are al&s;o three families of univer&s;ali&s;ts, and one of epi&s;copalians here.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now go on to &s;ome Geographical De|&s;cription of Athol. This town&s;hip was originally granted to &s;ixty proprietors, with a re&s;erve of a right of land for the fir&s;t &s;ettled mini&s;ter, a right for the u&s;e of the mini&s;try, and one for a &s;chool: It was to contain as much as &s;ix miles &s;quare. A part of the town was &s;et off, at the &s;outhea&s;t angle, to aid in forming the town of Gerry, and a part at the northwe&s;t corner, to help form the di&s;trict of Orange; but &s;till the town of Athol is more than five miles &s;quare, and contains 16000 acres of land.
<PB N="246" REF="026481_0245_0FD057540978D1E8">
It is very uneven, rocky, and hilly, though there are no famous or remarkable hills in the place; nor any with names, except one in the ea&s;t part of the town, called <HI>Walnut Hill,</HI> from the con&s;iderable quantity of walnut wood and timber growing thereon. The &s;oil of this town is not &s;o good as &s;ome: It is rather cold, con&s;equently not extraor|dinary for grain of any kind, for orcharding, or for mowing: It is &s;aid to be very good for grazing; and much beef is annually fatted in the place. There is &s;ome pitch pine plain in the north part of the town; there is al&s;o con&s;iderable white pine remaining in the we&s;terly part of the place; but oak, che&s;nut, a&s;h, beech, birch, hemlock, and ma|ple, con&s;titute the principal growth of wood. The town has its full &s;hare of water.

Mill Brook, &s;o call|ed from its having upon it many convenient &s;eats for mills, ri&s;es from various &s;prings in the &s;outh|ea&s;terly part of the town, and runs northwe&s;terly, and falls into Miller's River in the we&s;t part of Athol. In the &s;outhea&s;terly part of the town ri&s;es a brook &s;ufficient to carry mills, which runs to a pond of thirty acres or more, which the line be|tween New&s;alem and Athol cro&s;&s;es in the &s;outh|we&s;t part, and from this pond there is an outlet which runs north, and empties into Miller's River. There is al&s;o another pond in the north part of the town, from whence there is an outlet into Tully Brook: This is &s;mall, covering perhaps twenty or thirty acres.</P>
<P>Upon the rivers and &s;treams abovementioned, there are in the town, four gri&s;t mills, &s;ix &s;aw mills, one fulling mill, and one trip hammer. We mu&s;t not omit to mention, there is a very fine &s;pring in this town, which i&s;&s;ues out of a high bank upon the &s;ide of Miller's River, (perhaps twenty feet above the &s;urface of the river) the wa|ter whereof is medicinal. Many per&s;ons who have drank freely thereof, have found it operate as a gentle cathartick; and &s;ome who have been poi&s;on|ed, have been &s;peedily cured by wa&s;hing the parts affected therewith. Several who have been afflict|ed with rheumatick complaints, bathed in the wa|ters of this &s;pring, in a ci&s;tern, &s;ome few years ago provided to receive them, and found great relief.

<P>The general growth of wood on the high lands, is red oak, beech, rock maple, and black birch, in|ter&s;per&s;ed with white pine and hemlock. On the low lands, white pine, hemlock, hacmatack, a&s;h of all kinds, and yellow birch, inter&s;per&s;ed with red oak and beech. On &s;ome of the lowe&s;t lands, there is little or nothing but pine, hemlock, and hacmatack. In &s;ome parts of the town there is che&s;nut, and in other parts pitch pine, but nei|ther of them in plenty.</P>
<P>Mines or minerals, none as yet have been di&s;|covered in the town: There are two or three &s;prings, however, of the mineral kind; one e&s;pec|ially in the northerly part of the town, which is thought by phy&s;icians and others acquainted with &s;uch things, to be equal to many in great repute for their healing virtue. It is certainly of the me|dicinal kind, and rather &s;eems of a chalybeate quality. There is but one pond which is wholly within the limits of this town, called <HI>Deni&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Pond,</HI> it covers perhaps as much as one hundred and fifty acres. It has an inlet from the north, and an outlet towards the &s;outh into a river which runs
<PB N="259" REF="026481_0258_0FD05781CB5D4570">
within an hundred rods of &s;aid pond. It abounds in fi&s;h of various kinds. There is one river, known by the name of Miller's River, the princi|pal &s;ource whereof is a large pond, lying chiefly in the northea&s;terly part of Rindge, a &s;mall part only falling within the bounds of Winchendon, where the outlet is. This pond is known by the name of <HI>Monomenock Pond.</HI> The outlet from this pond, together with &s;ome &s;mall &s;treams from ponds in the northwe&s;terly part of A&s;hburnham, uniting in the northea&s;terly part of Winchendon, form Miller's River, which runs we&s;terly, &s;outh|we&s;terly and &s;outherly, half round the town; in no place nearer than one mile of the meeting|hou&s;e, and in &s;ome places three miles and more from it. It leaves this town in the &s;outhwe&s;terly part thereof, not far from the pond above de&s;crib|ed, the outlet of which, as we have &s;aid, falls into this river. Otter River, &s;o called, which runs through the northerly part of Templeton, ju&s;t touches on Winchendon, in the &s;outhwe&s;terly part thereof, and runs nigh the bounds of the town about a mile and a half, and unites with Miller's River, but ju&s;t before it leaves Winchen|don. There are two large &s;treams in the we&s;terly part of this town, taking their ri&s;e in Fitzwilliam. One of them joins Miller's River in Winchendon, near to Royal&s;ton: This is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any particular name. The other, &s;till larger, runs into Royal&s;ton, and &s;ome con&s;iderable way in the ea&s;terly part thereof; then turns and enters Win|chendon, and after running &s;everal miles, joins

Miller's River ju&s;t above Deni&s;on's Pond. This &s;tream might have been denominated a river from its largene&s;s, had it not early received the appel|lation of Prie&s;t's Brook. This name was given to it from the circum&s;tance of its running through a tract of land, now lying in Royal&s;ton, formerly granted by the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts to a Jo&s;eph Prie&s;t, to induce him to &s;et up an hou&s;e of entertainment for the benefit of travellers from this &s;tate to the A&s;huelots (Keene and Swan&s;ey) and to No. 4 (Charle&s;town) in the &s;tate of New|hamp&s;hire. The hou&s;e of this Prie&s;t, was called <HI>The Half Way Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two &s;treams, e&s;pecially the latter, abound with &s;almon trouts. This &s;ort of fi&s;h is al&s;o found in many parts of Miller's River, as al&s;o pickerel and perch.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the abovementioned, there are many other &s;treams and rivulets running in every part of this town, whereby it is exceedingly well watered.</P>
<P>There is but little meadow land, perhaps not more than one hundred and fifty acres in the town of Winchendon.</P>
<P>Interval land on Miller's River there is con&s;id|erable, and what is improved is of a very good quality. But of this there is not &s;o much as might have been expected; for the high lands in mo&s;t places &s;hut down quite clo&s;e upon the riv|er. Upon the rivers and &s;treams in the town there are two gri&s;t mills, &s;ix &s;aw mills, and one clothier's works. There are al&s;o in the town, two pota&s;h works.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="026481_0260_0FD0578348F89D98">Roads in various directions centre at, or near the meetinghou&s;e.

<P>THIS is, as to the original grant and &s;ettlement, doubtle&s;s by many years, the young|e&s;t town in the county. It was in the year 1752, or very &s;oon after, granted to the Hon. Me&s;&s;rs. Hubbard, Erving, Royal, Otis, and others, and was to include all the unappropriated lands be|tween Newhamp&s;hire line, on the north; Warwick,

on the we&s;t; Athol and Templeton, on the &s;outh; Winchendon, on the ea&s;t and &s;outh; and A&s;hburn|ham, on the ea&s;t. This grant was known by the name of Royal&s;hire, until its incorporation, which was on February 16th, 1765, when it was called <HI>Royal&s;ton,</HI> in compliment to the late Col. <HI>I&s;aac Roy|al,</HI> one of the original proprietors. Before the la&s;t French war, &s;ome who intended to &s;ettle here, began to work upon their lands, but the breaking out of that war put an entire &s;top there|to. Towards the clo&s;e of that war &s;ome people began to work here again; and in the year 1762 &s;everal families moved into the place; the fir&s;t of which came in, in the month of June. Its in|crea&s;e was truly &s;urpri&s;ing, for in le&s;s than three years, it was incorporated with di&s;tinct town priv|ileges; and in the clo&s;e of the year 1767, there were about forty families in the town. The number of families at this time is 195, and the number of &s;ouls about 1130; be&s;ides that, there were a number of families with their e&s;tates &s;et off to aid in forming the di&s;trict of Orange, in the county of Hamp&s;hire. As early as the year 1766, on the 13th day of October, a congregational church was imbodied here, under the counte|nance, and in the pre&s;ence of the churches in the vicinity; and on the 19th of October, 1768, the fir&s;t and pre&s;ent pa&s;tor, the Rev. Jo&s;eph Lee, was ordained to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try among them.</P>
<P>There were nine or ten families of the bapti&s;t denomination among the fir&s;t &s;ettlers. At what
<PB N="263" REF="026481_0262_0FD04FED8D3AA478">
time they imbodied into a church &s;tate is not known to us. A Mr. Eli&s;ha Rich was their teach|er, but he was never ordained among them. He was &s;ucceeded by Mr. Whitman Jacobs, who was in&s;talled December 13th, 1770. He lived in A|thol, to which town part of his &s;ociety belonged, and there he now re&s;ides. Mr. Mo&s;es Kinney is now the ordained teacher of the bapti&s;ts in Roy|al&s;ton.</P>
<P>The lands in this town con&s;i&s;t generally of hills and valleys; and the &s;oil is very excellent, being &s;uitable for tillage, pa&s;turage, mowing and orchard|ing. The natural growth of wood is of various kinds, as oak, che&s;nut, beech, a&s;h, white, black and yellow birch, maple, or &s;ugar tree, ba&s;s, alder, and the ever greens, as pine, hemlock, hacmatack and &s;pruce, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This town is exceedingly well watered by riv|ers, rivulets and &s;prings. Miller's River runs through this town from the ea&s;t. And there are a number of con&s;iderable brooks or &s;treams, which uniting, form what is called Tully River in Athol. In the &s;outherly part of the town one of the &s;treams which helps to form Tully River, has very ob&s;ervable falls. In the cour&s;e of forty or fifty rods, the whole fall of water is more than a hundred feet. In one place it is twenty feet, or more. On the&s;e &s;everal &s;treams before mention|ed are large quantities of rich interval, or excel|lent meadow lands.</P>
<P>There are two ponds in the town; one &s;mall, a little we&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e; the other about

a mile further we&s;tward, called <HI>Long Pond.</HI> A &s;mall &s;tream runs out of the le&s;&s;er into the greater.</P>
<P>Although the di&s;tance between the&s;e ponds is but little more than half a mile in a direct line, yet the little pond is at lea&s;t an hundred and fifty feet higher than the other. There are in both ponds, various &s;orts of fi&s;h, and in great plenty; tho&s;e in the larger are mo&s;t excellent.

<P>ON the 10th of June, 1735, a grant was made by the General Court, to Thomas Tile|&s;tone and others, for and in con&s;ideration of &s;er|vices done by officers and &s;oldiers of the ancient town of Dorche&s;ter, in the expedition to Canada in 1690, under Capt.

incorporation, which was on the 22d of February, 1765, when it received its pre&s;ent name. To the original grant were afterwards added Lexington farm of a thou&s;and acres, Cambridge farm of a thou&s;and more, Rolfe's farm of &s;ix hundred, and another of about a thou&s;and acres.</P>
<P>The church of Chri&s;t in A&s;hburnham was gath|ered April 23d, 1760, and the &s;ame day the Rev. Jonathan Winche&s;ter was ordained their fir&s;t pa&s;|tor. This gentleman was &s;omewhat advanced in life when he was &s;ettled in the work of the mini&s;|try; and he continued but a &s;hort &s;pace therein, leaving the world November 25th, 1767. To him &s;ucceeded in the &s;acred office and work, the Rev. John Cu&s;hing, who was &s;olemnly con&s;ecrat|ed hereunto November 2d, 1768. In the town there are about twenty families of bapti&s;ts, who manife&s;t far greater catholici&s;m than formerly. The whole number of families is about 150, and of inhabitants about 970, be&s;ides a number who were &s;et off to A&s;hby, in the county of Middle&s;ex, with about 3000 acres of land, and a number to the town of Gardner, with about 2000 acres more.</P>
<P>In this town are &s;ituated two large hills, or mountains, <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Little Wetatick.</HI> Great Wet|atick lies in the northea&s;t part of the town, and Little Wetatick to the &s;outhwe&s;t from it.</P>
<P>There are &s;even ponds within the limits of A&s;h|burnham, which divide it nearly into two equal parts, north and &s;outh. Two of them are large, viz. Great and Little Naukheag. The others are not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any particular names. Here
<PB N="266" REF="026481_0265_0FD057618809F3F0">
are no rivers; but the&s;e ponds are &s;ources of &s;ev|eral &s;treams, which take different routes, and con|tribute to the formation of &s;everal large rivers. From Little Naukheag, which is near the centre of the town, a rivulet empties into Great Naukheag, whence a &s;tream i&s;&s;ues to the we&s;t, which makes part of Miller's River. About three quarters of a mile ea&s;t of Little Naukheag begins another &s;tream, which runs &s;outhea&s;t, and joining in Fitchburg with another &s;tream from We&s;tmin&s;ter, and other &s;mall &s;treams, helps to form the north branch of Na&s;haway River. Northea&s;t from this la&s;t men|tioned &s;tream, ari&s;e two more, which, joining &s;oon, run through A&s;hby into Newip&s;wich, in the State of Newhamp&s;hire, and become a large branch of Souheagan River, which empties into the great river Merrimack. Hence it appears that this town is upon the height of land between Connecticut river on the we&s;t, and Merrimack on the ea&s;t. And what is worthy of particular notice is this, that &s;carce any water runs into this town: It be|ing conjectured that all which comes in, from all quarters, would pa&s;s through a man's boot. On &s;treams i&s;&s;uing from three of the ponds in A&s;h|burnham, there are mills, and a fine &s;eat for more on the &s;tream which runs out of Great Naukheag, not yet improved. On the banks of Little Nauk|heag is a white &s;and, equal in &s;inene&s;s and white|ne&s;s to that on the banks of Capeanne, and which it is judged would make gla&s;s.</P>
<P>There is much broken land in this town. Some parts abound in hemlock, &s;pruce, white and pitch
<PB N="267" REF="026481_0266_0FD0578947D1CCF0">
pine; this is the ca&s;e more e&s;pecially in the we&s;|tern part; however, there is much good land for gra&s;s. Where the growth of wood is oak, hard and &s;oft maple beach, birch and che&s;nut, the land is moi&s;t and good for grazing. It has been a not|ed place for lumber: The be&s;t pine timber is mo&s;t|ly worked up: There yet remain great quantities of white and pitch pine, &s;uitable for boards. There are five &s;aw mills, and four corn mills in the town. Here are pota&s;h works, and have been from its infancy; and the fir&s;t complete ton of this article carried into market was from A&s;hburnham. Here are no remarkable &s;prings, or other natural curio&s;i|ties. They have an elegant new meetinghou&s;e. The former hou&s;e of publick wor&s;hip was, about twenty years ago, wrecked by an hurricane, and moved three or four feet to the north and ea&s;t; a barn, about &s;ixty rods to the &s;outh, was torn down, while the owner within it e&s;caped unhurt. This hurricane pa&s;&s;ed from the we&s;t to the ea&s;t, extend|ing about half a mile in width, and upon the hills &s;wept all before it. The town enjoys a fine air, and is remarkably healthy.</P>
<P>Its di&s;tance from Worce&s;ter, is thirty miles to the north; and from Bo&s;ton, by the neare&s;t route, is fifty five miles, but through Lanca&s;ter and Stow, it is &s;ixty miles, and lies to the northwe&s;t.</P>
<P>A&s;hburnham is bounded on the north, by the State line; on the northea&s;t, by A&s;hby; on the ea&s;t, by Fitchburg; on the &s;outh, by We&s;tmin&s;ter and Gardner; and on the we&s;t, by Winchendon.</P>

<HEAD>PAXTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was taken from the towns of Leice&s;ter and Rutland, in nearly equal parts; and was incorporated on the 12th of February, 1765, when it received its name.</P>
<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate of this town has been &s;omewhat &s;ingular, from the gathering of the church of Chri&s;t in the place, to the pre&s;ent time, as will appear by the following account.</P>
<P>The church in Paxton, was imbodied September 3d, 1767. The Rev. Silas Biglow was ordained their fir&s;t mini&s;ter the &s;ame year, viz. October 21&s;t, 1767. He was much beloved and re&s;pected by the people of his charge, but the Great Head of the church &s;uffered him to continue but a little more than two years in office, being removed by death, November 16th, 1769.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded in the work of the go&s;pel min|i&s;try by the Rev. Alexander Thayer, who was &s;olemnly &s;eparated hereunto on the 28th of No|vember, 1770. Mr. Thayer continued not quite twelve years with the people, being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from office Augu&s;t 14th, 1782.</P>
<P>They were de&s;titute, after this, of a &s;ettled min|i&s;ter for more than three years, until September 8th, 1785, when the Rev. John Fo&s;ter was ordain|ed their third pa&s;tor; at which time the town was in a mo&s;t unhappy divided &s;tate, there being but a bare majority for Mr. Fo&s;ter; the other party

di&s;&s;enting, and prote&s;ting, utterly refu&s;ed to hear him, and were by law exempted from contributing to his &s;upport. In this &s;ituation the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ople re|mained for three years and a half, until April, 1789, when Mr. Fo&s;ter was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;toral relation to the people.</P>
<P>Mr. Fo&s;ter was, in about three years after, in|&s;talled at Taunton, in the county of Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>After Mr. Fo&s;ter's removal from Paxton the parties amicably reunited, and are in a way for the happy re&s;ettlement of the go&s;pel mini&s;try among them.</P>
<P>If the people do but continue united, they are able to &s;upport the go&s;pel in a very honourable, generous manner: For the town, though not large, is well &s;ettled, being an excellent tract of land, and the inhabitants in general are indu&s;trious, good, and wealthy farmers. It is plea&s;ant, although uneven, having many hills and valleys; but the &s;oil is rich and productive: It is good for all kinds of grain, and well repays the labour be&s;towed upon i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: It is peculiarly good for gra&s;s and pa&s;turing, and like|wi&s;e for orcharding. The high lands are moi&s;t and &s;pringy, not too rocky; and the lower lands are &s;wamps or meadows, but ea&s;ily drained. The wood which grows on the higher lands, is oak, much walnut, &s;ome che&s;nut; and in the lower lands, are found birch, beech, maple and a&s;h. It is truly noticeable that the wood in this town, when cut down, never &s;prouts again, in con&s;e|quence of which they are threatened with a &s;car|city of fuel.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="026481_0269_0FD057648A7BD680">The town is exceedingly well watered by &s;prings from the hills; and by &s;mall &s;treams, on which they have both corn and &s;aw mills. From the &s;ame &s;pring, about half a mile north of the meet|inghou&s;e, waters i&s;&s;ue, which &s;oon divide and take quite different and contrary directions; part runs northea&s;terly into the river Na&s;haway; part runs &s;outhwe&s;terly into Connecticut river. There are two hills in the town of great height, and worthy of particular mention: One is called Turkey Hill, near Rutland line, this is large, and affords good farms; and e&s;pecially fine pa&s;ture land: At the foot of this hill, on the we&s;t &s;ide, lies Turkey Hill Pond, large, and well &s;tored with fi&s;h; and from this pond runs a &s;tream which empties into Chica|bee River, and from thence into Connecticut river. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town, and in that part which was formerly Leice&s;ter, is &s;ituated what is called A&s;nebum&s;kit Hill, the foot of which, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, falls within the bounds of Holden. This is a large and high hill, containing &s;everal hundred acres, the land is rich and good; e&s;pecially adapt|ed for pa&s;turage. It lies about twelve miles &s;outh of Watchu&s;ett great hill, and except that, overtops all other hills within forty or fifty miles of it. Around this hill the vapours gather &s;o plentifully, or become &s;o den&s;e the evening preceding a rain, that it appears at a di&s;tance as if it rained upon its &s;ummit. To this hill many of the farmers, in the vicinity, look at evening, or a little before the &s;etting of the &s;un, in the time of making hay, that they may be able to determine with a good degree

of certainty, what the weather will be the next day. Near the foot of this hill, is &s;ituated A&s;nebum&s;kit Pond; which is a fine large pond, and well &s;uppli|ed with fi&s;h: From this pond there i&s;&s;ues a &s;tream, which runs to the northea&s;t through Holden, and joining the &s;tream from the foot of Watchu&s;ett Hill, helps to form the &s;outh branch of Na&s;haway River. From &s;prings, on the northwe&s;terly part of A&s;nebum&s;kit Hill, a &s;tream is formed, which run|ning &s;outherly, pa&s;&s;es through Leice&s;ter, and &s;o to French River. The above ob&s;ervations &s;hew us that Paxton is &s;ituated on the height of the lands between the &s;ea, on the ea&s;t and &s;outh, and Con|necticut river on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>In Paxton, works for making pota&s;h have lately been &s;et up: And here a &s;mall number of cotton and wool cards are annually made.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in this town was found in 1791, to be 558.</P>

re&s;igned his office, and retired to Northborough, and &s;pent the re&s;idue of his days in the family of the late Rev. John Martyn. Mrs. Monis and Mrs. Martyn were &s;i&s;ters. He left &s;omething very hon|ourable and generous to the church in Northbor|ough. He bequeathed forty &s;ix pounds thirteen &s;hillings and four pence, to be equally divided a|mong &s;even of the mini&s;ters then living in the vicin|ity: Al&s;o, he left about an hundred and twenty &s;ix pounds as a fund, the intere&s;t whereof was to be di&s;|tributed among widows of mini&s;ters who were in indigent circum&s;tances; and the remainder of his e&s;tate, which was con&s;iderable, he gave to the Mar|tyn family.</P>

<P>This &s;econd precinct in We&s;tborough was in|corporated February 24th, 1766, and from its local &s;ituation and bearing, was called Northbor|ough.</P>
<P>There were &s;ettlers in this part of Marlborough before there were any in what is now We&s;tbor|ough. As early as 1700, or rather before, a few families had fixed down here. And there was a garri&s;on kept at a hou&s;e on the lower &s;ide of the town towards Marlborough, near the brook where Me&s;&s;rs. Bartlets now live. On Augu&s;t 18th, 1707, as two women belonging to the garri&s;on were out a little way from the fort, gathering herbs, the In|dians di&s;covered and pur&s;ued them. One Mrs. Mary Fay, got &s;afe into the &s;ort; the other, Mary Goodenow, a young and unmarried woman, was taken and carried over the brook into the edge of Marlborough, and there, a little &s;outh of the great road, and nigh to Sandy Hill, &s;o called, &s;he was killed and &s;calped. The enemy were pur&s;ued by &s;ome &s;oldiers and people of Marlborough; and were overtaken the next day, in that part of Lan|ca&s;ter, now called Sterling,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ccount of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">attle in the hi&s;tory of Lanca&s;ter and Sterli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> when a mo&s;t bloody battle was fought, in which two of our people, John Farrar and Richard Singletary, were killed.

<P>The town of Northborough lies in a kind of valley between the high lands of Marlborough on the ea&s;t, and tho&s;e of Shrew&s;bury and Boyl&s;ton on the we&s;t. On its ea&s;terly &s;ide it is about four miles long, and on its we&s;terly about five: It is on an average about three miles and an half wide from ea&s;t to we&s;t, containing about 90 dwelling hou&s;es, upwards of an 100 families, and accord|ing to the late cen&s;us 620 inhabitants. It would doubtle&s;s admit of 150 or more families, were the large farms (&s;ome of which contain four hundred or five hundred acres) properly divided. This is beginning to take place, and in a few years proba|bly will be accompli&s;hed. The inhabitants are chiefly farmers, and wealthy: They have al&s;o traders in European and We&s;tindia goods; and various trade&s;men and mechanicks, e&s;pecially an excellent maker of edge tools of various kinds; and con&s;idering its dimen&s;ions and number, it is doubtle&s;s one of the able&s;t pari&s;hes in the county. The poore&s;t land in general appears as we travel the great road. The farms which lie off are good, and much of the land very fertile. The we&s;terly &s;ide
<PB N="276" REF="026481_0275_0FD0576909EE6778">
of the town ri&s;es into high land, and the north|we&s;t angle is very high; but the land is not rocky, and the farms are excellent, and from thence the pro&s;pect is exten&s;ive. There is one beautiful hill, called <HI>Liguor Hill,</HI> containing towards an hundred acres of land, very good, oppo&s;ite the meeting|hou&s;e, and not more than &s;ixty or eighty rods from it, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the po&s;t road. This is high, and &s;een from all the neighbouring towns; but it is not inacce&s;&s;ible even to teams. Its &s;um|mit is covered with a fine growth of good wood at pre&s;ent. About one mile northea&s;t from the meet|inghou&s;e is another hill, very &s;imilar, called Ed|mund Hill. Upon the river A&s;&s;abet, which runs through the ea&s;terly part of the town, are va&s;t bodies of rich interval and good meadow lands. And upon the other &s;treams and rivulets there are large and good meadows, e&s;pecially on that called <HI>Cold Harbour,</HI> which ri&s;es in the north part of Shrew&s;bury, and cro&s;&s;ing the &s;outhea&s;t angle of Boyl&s;ton, turns and runs &s;outherly, then turns and runs ea&s;terly, and pa&s;&s;ing between the po&s;t road and meetinghou&s;e, &s;oon empties it&s;elf into the riv|er A&s;&s;abet. On the above named &s;tream, in the we&s;terly part of the town, are a corn and &s;aw mill, one a few rods below the other, and as there is a &s;mall outlet from Rocky Pond, in the ea&s;terly part of Boyl&s;ton, which empties into this Cold Harbour &s;tream, &s;o the owner of tho&s;e mills, by means of a &s;mall dam at the lower end of &s;aid pond, furni&s;hes them with a rich &s;upply of water, although di&s;tant a mile or more. In the north
<PB N="277" REF="026481_0276_0FD05790C92F8060">
part of the town are a corn and &s;aw mill together, on North Brook, which coming from a pond in Lanca&s;ter, and running through Berlin and the northea&s;t angle of Northborough, falls into the river A&s;&s;abet. A little north of the meetinghou&s;e runs a &s;mall but la&s;ting &s;tream from the hills in the we&s;terly part of the town, on which is a &s;aw mill which performs con&s;iderable work in the &s;pring and autumn. In the town there are two ponds; one called <HI>Solomon's Pond,</HI> from the cir|cum&s;tance of an Indian of that name being drown|ed therein, by falling through a raft on which he was fi&s;hing. This is in the northea&s;terly part of the town. It is not large; about ninety rods long, and &s;eventy five rods wide; has plenty of fi&s;h: To this pond there is no vi&s;ible inlet nor outlet.</P>
<P>The other is in the &s;outhea&s;terly part of the town, called <HI>Little Chauncy</HI>; this al&s;o is well fur|ni&s;hed with fi&s;h. From <HI>Great Chauncy</HI> Pond, in the northea&s;terly part of We&s;tborough, there is a &s;mall outlet which runs into <HI>Little Chauncy</HI>; and from <HI>Little Chauncy</HI> a brook runs northerly, and cro&s;&s;ing the po&s;t road on the line between Marl|borough and Northborough, and the boundary be|tween the two counties of Middle&s;ex and Worce&s;|ter, empties its waters into A&s;&s;abet River, On this &s;tream are a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and a &s;aw mill together; and although it be &s;mall, yet by clearing it of ob&s;truc|tions, and a little digging in a few places, they are &s;upplied with a large quantity of water from both

The&s;e works are the property of two brothers, Captains Samuel and Abraham Wood; but the bu&s;ine&s;s is performed at pre&s;ent by the latter only. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the road and river are works for the manufacture of iron, and where many tons have been made. There is in the vicinity a great plenty of ore, e&s;pecially of the bog kind. Near the forge are works for the making of pota&s;h, where large quantities are man|ufactured yearly. About a mile below, on this &s;ame river, is a gri&s;t mill which fails not to grind through the year. Thus there are four corn, and four &s;aw mills within the town.</P>
<P>There are, in this town, curious works for the conveyance of water to a great di&s;tance, the prop|erty, contrivance, and execution of Major Hollo|way Taylor. I know not that there are any &s;imi|lar works in the county, and would therefore de|&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>From &s;prings i&s;&s;uing out of ledges of rocks on ri&s;ing lands, this gentleman has rai&s;ed a &s;mall pond, and from thence brings fine water (about &s;eventy rods, through bored logs, under ground, not only in low lands, but in &s;ome places higher

As the water pa&s;&s;es under ground nigh the barn yard by a tube from a log, entering the bot|tom of a large trough, he has a rich &s;upply of wa|ter for a great &s;tock of cattle; and &s;uch is the qual|ity of the water that it has &s;eldom ever been known to freeze in trough or vat.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As this account may be read by &s;ome not much acquainted with natu|ral philo&s;ophy, and who therefore may think it incredible that water can be made to pa&s;s over ri&s;ing grounds, and through low lands, alternately, as in this ca&s;e, and then ri&s;e to &s;uch a height in the hou&s;e; (for the&s;e logs are carried along under ploughed fields and mowing lands;) for the &s;ake of &s;uch it ought to be ob&s;erved, that water may be conveyed any where, to ri&s;e exactly to the height of the fountain or pond from whence it proceeds; al|though it cannot be carried to a greater height in its way to the place in|tended.</P>
<P>Should any per&s;ons wi&s;h to convey water in this manner, they may be in|formed, that yellow or pitch pine logs are much be&s;t for the purpo&s;e; they are harder and more durable; tho&s;e of che&s;nut are too &s;pungy and porous.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The general growth of wood in the town is che&s;nut, walnut, the &s;everal &s;orts of oak, &s;ome white pine, and large quantities of pitch pine, which of late years, is in great demand, as an ex|cellent wood for fuel.</P>
<P>Northborough lies about thirty &s;ix miles from the Statehou&s;e in Bo&s;ton, and is eight or nine degrees to the &s;outh of we&s;t; and is ten miles from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, a few degrees to the north of ea&s;t. This town is greatly benefited by
<PB N="280" REF="026481_0279_0FD0576C46483338">
the publick roads, which in different directions pa&s;s through it. Be&s;ides the po&s;t road from Bo&s;|ton to Worce&s;ter, (and &s;o to the &s;eat of govern|ment,) which runs through it but a few rods &s;outh of the meetinghou&s;e; there is another from New|hamp&s;hire State, and the northern part of the county of Worce&s;ter, and coming through Lan|ca&s;ter or Harvard, and Bolton and Berlin, pa&s;&s;es directly through this town, ju&s;t by the meeting|hou&s;e, and cro&s;&s;ing the po&s;t road, leads on to Mendon and Providence. The road al&s;o from Worce&s;ter and Shrew&s;bury, through Framingham to Bo&s;ton, pa&s;&s;es through the &s;outh part of the town into We&s;tborough. There is al&s;o a road of much travel from Hubbard&s;ton, Princeton, Hol|den, Sterling, and e&s;pecially Boyl&s;ton, which coming in upon the northwe&s;terly part of the town, pa&s;&s;es directly in front of the meetinghou&s;e, and then in the &s;pace of about fifty rods, falls in|to the po&s;t road.</P>
<P>Another great benefit the town reaps, is from the great re&s;ort of people from all the neighbouring towns to the corn and &s;aw mills, to the fulling mill and forge, and to the black&s;miths', for their works of various kinds, as well as to the &s;hops and &s;tores.</P>
<P>Northborough is bounded on the north, by Ber|lin; on the ea&s;t, by Marlborough and Southbor|ough; on the &s;outh, by We&s;tborough; and on the we&s;t, by Shrew&s;bury and Boyl&s;ton.</P>

<HEAD>HUBBARDSTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was called "the northea&s;t quarter of Rutland," being wholly included in the original grant of that town, and was incorpo|rated on the 13th day of June, 1767, and called Hubbard&s;ton, to perpetuate the name and memo|ry of the late Hon. Thomas Hubbard, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Bo&s;ton, who had been &s;ometime &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; after that, &s;everal years a coun&s;ellor of the then province, and for many years trea&s;urer, and of cour&s;e a member, of the cor|poration of Harvard Univer&s;ity in Cambridge. He was a large proprietor of lands in this place.</P>
<P>The congregational church in Hubbard&s;ton was imbodied on the 13th of June, 1770, and on the &s;ame day the Rev. Nehemiah Parker was ordain|ed to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try in the place, and who &s;till continues in peace and love with the people, and mini&s;tering to them in holy things.</P>
<P>We proceed to a de&s;cription of this place. It is about &s;ix miles &s;quare; and is bounded we&s;t, by Barre; &s;outh, by Rutland; ea&s;t, by Princeton: northea&s;t, by We&s;tmin&s;ter; and north, by Gard|ner, Templeton and Gerry. The town is agreea|bly inter&s;per&s;ed with hills and valleys. Perhaps about a twelfth part of it is meadow and interval. The uplands are generally, excellent for grazing and &s;ome con&s;iderable part very good for the
<PB N="282" REF="026481_0281_0FD0576D87FAA5F8">
growth of Engli&s;h gra&s;s. The land in general, is not the be&s;t for grain; though in common years a &s;ufficiency is rai&s;ed for the inhabitants. It is rather too cold for orcharding, although there are a number of flouri&s;hing orchards in the town, and &s;ome years a con&s;iderable quantity of cider is made. Hills there are &s;everal in the town, how|ever, but two which we &s;hall notice: The large&s;t, in the northwe&s;terly part of the town, extends quite through it, from Templeton to Barre; this is call|ed Burn&s;hirt Hill, and is mo&s;t excellent land. The other is called Read's Hill, &s;ituated about one mile and an half ea&s;t from the centre of the town; this is al&s;o very good land.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed this town is rich in iron ore, at lea&s;t; there is a hill in the north part of it, extend|ing into Templeton,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this al&s;o noticed in the account of Templeton.</NOTE> where a number of gentle|men from Bo&s;ton and other places, wrought near fifty years ago. They dug &s;everal rods into the hill, in que&s;t of a &s;ilver mine; but whether it an|&s;wered their expectations or not, was not divulged. A war commencing put a &s;top to their pur&s;uit, and it has never &s;ince been rea&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>The town is finely watered by &s;prings, &s;treams and rivers; There are five rivers and &s;treams no|ticeable, which pa&s;s through the town from north to &s;outh. The mo&s;t ea&s;terly of the&s;e is called Pi&s;s River, part whereof comes from We&s;tmin&s;ter, and part from the we&s;t &s;ide of Watchu&s;ett Hill in Princeton. The next is called Ware River, which heads in Hubbard&s;ton. The next is a &s;maller &s;tream, called Meadow Brook, which takes its ri&s;e
<PB N="283" REF="026481_0282_0FD05796381E2E30">
in the north part of the town. Further we&s;t is an|other &s;tream called Conney&s;tow Brook, which has its &s;ource in Templeton. The mo&s;t we&s;terly &s;tream is known by the name of <HI>Burn&s;hirt River,</HI> the principal branch of which comes from Gerry. All the&s;e &s;treams running a &s;outherly direction, unite in the ea&s;t part of Barre, where their names, as well as waters, are &s;wallowed up in Ware Riv|er. <HI>Otter River,</HI> &s;o called, which ri&s;es in Temple|ton, runs in the north part of this town, and then turning, falls back into Templeton, and at length, unites with Miller's River.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this more particularly de&s;cribed in the account of Templeton.</NOTE> On the&s;e rivers and &s;treams, within the town of Hubbard&s;ton, there are eleven &s;aw mills, five gri&s;t mills, and one clothiers' works. There are al&s;o works for making pota&s;h in the town.</P>
<P>There are three ponds in Hubbard&s;ton. The large&s;t of the&s;e, known by the name of the Great A&s;naconcomick Pond, is about two miles from the centre of the town, to the ea&s;t: It is a mile and a half in length, from north to &s;outh; the breadth is various, from half a mile to five rods, &s;uppo&s;ed to cover about three hundred acres. About half a mile further to the northea&s;t, is &s;ituated Little A&s;naconcomick Pond, of a circular form; and what merits particular notice is this, that for a con&s;iderable part of the way round this pond, there is every appearance that once a &s;tone wall was built, or building. In &s;ome places it is two feet and an half in height, as if laid up by the hands of men; and where there is not one
<PB N="284" REF="026481_0283_0FD0576F081296E0">
&s;tone upon another, the appearance is as of a large &s;tone wall thrown down. If this was the work of art, when and by whom it was performed, or wherefore, perhaps can never be a&s;certained. Both the Ponds before de&s;cribed are fed by &s;mall &s;prings. There is a &s;mall outlet from each. An|other &s;mall pond is &s;ituated about a mile north|we&s;t from the centre of the town; it is called <HI>Natty Pond,</HI> which has both an inlet and an outlet. The growth of wood in this place is chiefly white pine and pitch pine in great plenty, hemlock, beech, maple and oak; there is but little of any other &s;ort.</P>
<P>The town is &s;ettled in general, with indu&s;trious farmers; and they are become numerous, and are increa&s;ing in wealth. There are about 150 fami|lies, and near 1000 &s;ouls in the place.</P>
<P>Hubbard&s;ton is &s;ituated &s;ixty miles, nearly we&s;t, from Bo&s;ton; and twenty from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, to the northwe&s;t. A road much u&s;ed, leads through the town from the &s;outh to the north, in which people pa&s;s from Rhodei&s;land, &amp;c. &amp;c. to the we&s;tern part of Newhamp&s;hire, and to the State of Vermont. It is al&s;o in contemplation to open a road from the towns on Connecticut river, in the county of Hamp&s;hire, through Peter&s;ham, to Hubbard&s;ton, and &s;o on through Princeton and Lanca&s;ter, to Bo&s;ton. This undoubtedly, would be the neare&s;t route, from Hadley and towns adja|cent, to the metropolis of the Commonwealth.</P>

<HEAD>NORTHBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Northbridge takes its name from its &s;ituation and bearing with re&s;pect to Uxbridge, from which it was chiefly taken; five or &s;ix families only being &s;et off to it from Sutton &s;outh or fir&s;t pari&s;h. It is about five miles in length, and about four in width; and is bounded, by Uxbridge, on the &s;outh; by Sutton, on the we&s;t; by Grafton, on the north; and by Mendon and Upton, on the ea&s;t and northea&s;t. It was in|corporated on the 14th of July, 1772. It is not large, having, at the time of the late enumeration 83 hou&s;es, and 570 inhabitants. The congrega|tional church here was imbodied, June the 6th, 1782, and on the 25th of June, 1783, the Rev. John Crane was ordained their pa&s;tor. Here al&s;o there is a &s;ociety of Bapti&s;ts of about ten families; at pre&s;ent de&s;titute of any &s;ettled teacher. There are al&s;o within the town twelve families of Quak|ers, and two or three of the Univer&s;ali&s;ts.</P>
<P>We &s;hall proceed to &s;ome Topographical De|&s;cription of this place.</P>
<P>It is uneven and &s;omewhat rocky and rough; but the land and &s;oil, in general, rich, &s;trong and good. As it has alternately, high and low lands, it is well calculated for orcharding, for pa&s;ture and gra&s;s land, and bears rye, Indian corn, oats, flax, &amp;c. Hills there are none high, or, on any account remarkable. The meetinghou&s;e ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d,

&s;tands on an eminence, and commands a good pro&s;pect for four or five miles round. As the lands in general are high, the air is &s;alubrious, and the inhabitants have been ble&s;&s;ed with great health from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the place.</P>
<P>There are no &s;tagnant waters or ponds in the town: But it is finely watered by &s;prings, &s;treams and rivers. Two of the&s;e are noticeable: Black|&s;tone River, which originates in Sutton, and pa&s;&s;|ing through the we&s;terly part of Grafton, enters this town, and runs from north to &s;outh the whole length of the town, on the we&s;terly &s;ide thereof. This is a large and fine river; and upon this there are great bodies of very excellent interval lands: Some of the&s;e are high, and bear corn and flax; the lower are good for gra&s;s.</P>
<P>There is another river, not &s;o large, which en|ters this town in the &s;outhwe&s;t part from Dougla&s;s, and joins Black&s;tone River. On this river there is a quantity of valuable meadow: But the land ad|joining the meadow is not the mo&s;t fertile.</P>

<HEAD>BARRE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was the northwe&s;t part of Rut|land Original Grant; it was made a di&s;trict by act of the Legi&s;lature in the year 1749, and called Rutland Di&s;trict, until June 14th, 1774, when it was made a town, and the name of <HI>Barre</HI> was given to it, as a token of re&s;pect to a great and worthy friend of America, at that time a member of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons. Barre is bound|ed on the north, by Peter&s;ham: on the ea&s;t, by Hubbard&s;ton; on the &s;outhea&s;t, by Rutland; on the &s;outh, by Oakham; on the &s;outhwe&s;t, by Newbraintree; and on the we&s;t, by Hardwick.</P>
<P>The church of Chri&s;t in this place, was gathered July 30th, 1753, and the Rev. Thomas Frink was

in&s;talled their pa&s;tor, on the la&s;t Wedne&s;day in October following. Mr. Frink was the fir&s;t mini&s;|ter of Rutland, and being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from thence, he was in&s;talled a pa&s;tor of the third chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch in Ply|mouth November 7th, 1743, where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ontinued but a little time before his remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al. He continu|ed in the mini&s;try at Barre, but about thirteen years, being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his &s;acred office, by advice of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council July 17th, 1766. He was &s;ucceeded in the pa&s;toral office at Barre, by the Rev. Jo&s;iah Dana, who was con&s;ecrated hereunto October 7th, 1767. Mr. Dana con|tinues in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try in this place, and in peace and e&s;teem with the people of his charge.</P>
<P>The following &s;orrowful occurrence took place in this town. In March, 1780, the hou&s;e of Mr. Peter Bent was con&s;umed by fire in the night, with almo&s;t every thing contained therein, and two of his children, a &s;on and daughter, of adult age, peri&s;hed in the flames.</P>
<P>The town of Barre is large in extent, being rather more than &s;ix miles &s;quare: And it is one of the be&s;t town&s;hips of land in the county; the &s;oil is exceedingly rich and &s;trong. The land in general, is very hilly and uneven. The hills, in|deed, are not &s;o very high, but &s;ome are &s;teep, and being &s;omewhat rocky, the roads are not &s;o good: But this is commonly the ca&s;e in mo&s;t towns where the &s;oil is excellent, and moi&s;t: The town is well watered by numerous &s;prings and rivulets, and the people enjoy great advantages for turning
<PB N="289" REF="026481_0288_0FD057AF8B50CA20">
and conveying the water over their gra&s;s land. The &s;oil is peculiarly adapted to mowing and pa&s;turage; and here they fat great multitudes of cattle, and make the be&s;t of beef. Here al&s;o they have many and large dairies; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that more butter and chee&s;e is carried from hence into the market, annually, than from any other town of the &s;ame extent. The &s;oil bears Indian corn well; but it is not &s;o well adapted to Engli&s;h grain as &s;ome other places. However, they rai&s;e a &s;ufficiency of all kinds for them&s;elves, and con|&s;iderable for exportation. As the town is uneven and hilly, it affords no large and commanding view of it&s;elf, but from the hills there is an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect into other towns. The plea&s;antne&s;s of Barre con&s;i&s;ts in the richne&s;s and fertility of the land, and the large, hand&s;ome, well fini&s;hed build|ings of all kinds; but from no one place can many of them be &s;een at once. The farms are large, and very productive: The people are indu&s;|trious, and they have great encouragement to la|bour: Their modes of hu&s;bandry are good, and there are &s;ure indications of wealth and opulence all over the town. And indeed it is one of the fore|mo&s;t towns in the county, there being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut three which pay more to a State tax.

<P>The general growth of wood in the town, is large and plenty, con&s;i&s;ting of oak of all kinds, e&s;pecial|ly

an unu&s;ual proportion of white oak; con&s;ider|able che&s;nut, &s;ome walnut; birch, beech, a&s;h, white pine, pitch pine, &s;ome hemlock, &amp;c. There is one large river, called Ware River, which com|ing from Templeton, through the we&s;terly part of Hubbard&s;ton, pa&s;&s;es through the ea&s;terly and &s;outherly parts of Barre, and then runs into Hard|wick. There is al&s;o a &s;tream originating in Gerry which runs through the town on the ea&s;terly &s;ide, within a mile of the meetinghou&s;e, called Plea&s;ant Branch: This falls into Ware River, in the &s;outh part of the town. In the north part of the town, on the we&s;terly &s;ide, ri&s;es another &s;tream from &s;prings, which is called Moo&s;e Brook, which runs into Hardwick, and there empties it&s;elf into Ware-River. On the&s;e &s;treams there are &s;ome meadows, and very good interval lands on Ware River in the &s;outherly part of the town. On this river, and on the&s;e &s;treams there are four gri&s;t mills, &s;ev|eral &s;aw mills, and clothiers' works.</P>
<P>The people in Barre &s;ub&s;i&s;t, mainly, by farm|ing; here are, however, all the u&s;ual trade&s;men and mechanicks, and two or three dealers in Eu|ropean, Ea&s;t and We&s;t India goods; here al&s;o the pot and pearl a&s;h works are carried on.</P>
<P>Barre is &s;ituated &s;ixty &s;ix miles from Bo&s;ton about we&s;t; and it is about twenty four miles from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, about northwe&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>WARD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS place was not an original grant, but was taken from &s;everal other towns, as Wor|ce&s;ter, Oxford, Sutton and Leice&s;ter, together with a gore of land lying between Oxford and Leice&s;|ter, not previou&s;ly belonging to any town. On the 23d of June, 1773, this place was erected into a poll pari&s;h, and commonly called the &s;outh pari&s;h of Worce&s;ter. The pari&s;h was limit|ed and bounded in the following manner: It was to extend three miles into Worce&s;ter, as the roads were then trod; three into Oxford, and three in|to Leice&s;ter by their roads, and one mile and an half into Sutton, from the meetinghou&s;e place. This place as above de&s;cribed, was incorporated and made a di&s;tinct town, and ve&s;ted with all the privileges which other towns enjoy, by an act of the Legi&s;lature, April 10th, 1778, when it received the name of Ward, as a compliment to the Hon. Major General Artemas Ward, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Shrew&s;bury, and now Repre&s;entative of this county in the Con|gre&s;s of the United States of America. The town is bounded northerly on Worce&s;ter; ea&s;terly, by Grafton; &s;outhea&s;t, by Sutton; &s;outh, by Ox|ford; and we&s;terly, by Leice&s;ter.</P>
<P>The church of Chri&s;t in Ward was imbodied on the 25th of January, 1776; and on the 3d of No|vember,

1784, the Rev. I&s;aac Bailey was ordained to the pa&s;toral care thereof, and &s;till continues in the &s;acred office.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now pre&s;ent the reader with a Geo|graphical De&s;cription of the town of Ward.</P>
<P>It is con&s;idered, by good judges, as a mo&s;t excel|lent tract of land: The &s;oil in general is fertile, rich and &s;trong, &s;uitable for orcharding and all kinds of fruit; well adapted to pa&s;turage and mowing, and produces large crops of rye, oats, wheat, barley, Indian corn, and flax. It is not very rocky; but affords &s;tone &s;ufficient for fenc|ing in the farms: It is not level, but rather une|ven, abounding in hills and valleys. The hills, however are not high; but the lands on them are good. Part of the hill, called Pro&s;pect Hill, to the &s;outh, lies within this town; al&s;o part of the hill, called <HI>Boggachoag,</HI> to the north; and part of the hill, called <HI>Gra&s;&s;y Hill,</HI> to the &s;outhea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e. On and near the&s;e hills, there are very fine farms. The general growth of wood is oak of the various &s;orts, che&s;nut, walnut, on the high lands; and in the lower lands, pine, maple, cedar, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The town is as well watered, by &s;prings and pe|rennial rivulets, as perhaps any other town in the county. The cour&s;e of the &s;treams is circuitous, and &s;o meandering as greatly to benefit the town. The principal &s;tream is that which is called French River. There is another called Kettle Brook, which pa&s;&s;es through the town. On the&s;e &s;treams there are four &s;aw mills and two gri&s;t mills, within

the town, al&s;o one clothiers' works; be&s;ides which there is a wind mill erected on <HI>Pro&s;pect Hill,</HI> which does con&s;iderable work.</P>
<P>There are three or four &s;mall ponds in the town, the large&s;t of which covers perhaps, about thirty acres, &s;ituated about a mile &s;outh of the meetinghou&s;e. There is an outlet from this pond, to the north, u&s;ually called Dark Brook; and there is an inlet from the &s;outh, while the pond is in its natural &s;tate, but by an artificial rai&s;ing of this pond about four feet, the current in the inlet is rever&s;ed and the di&s;charge of water is to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>The town is not large, but it is wealthy; there are about 80 hou&s;es; about 90 families, and when they were numbered there were 473 &s;ouls: It is &s;ituated fifty five miles from Bo&s;ton, a little to the &s;outhwe&s;t; and five miles from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, almo&s;t &s;outh.</P>

of April, 1780. Soon after it was made a pari&s;h, a congregational church was here gathered, viz. on the 15th of April, 1741, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty &s;ix male members; and on the 21&s;t of De|cember, 1743, the Rev. Amariah Fro&s;t, was &s;ol|emnly inve&s;ted with the pa&s;toral office in the place. Some time after the &s;ettlement of Mr. Fro&s;t, a &s;eparation took place here; a Mr. Hovey preached to the di&s;affected, and was ordained a|mong them. He tarried but a few years; &s;ince his time preaching by itinerants and lay|men, and meetings held occa&s;ionally on the &s;abbath, have been continued among them. A number, not large, believing in the &s;alvation of all men, have kept up publick meetings, and &s;ome|times had preaching. There are a few anabapti&s;ts in this place, and but one family of friends or quakers. The Rev. Mr. Fro&s;t continued the wor|thy and faithful pa&s;tor of the congregational church in Milford, until March 14th, 1792, when he died in the &s;eventy &s;econd year of his age, and the forty ninth of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>An addition to, and a general repair of their meetinghou&s;e was made in 1792, and it is now a very decent and convenient building.</P>
<P>There has been greater candour and moderation of late between tho&s;e of different &s;entiments in this town, than formerly was di&s;covered; and it is hoped greater unanimity will take place in the re|&s;ettlement of the go&s;pel mini&s;try among them.</P>
<P>We proceed to a Geographical De&s;cription of the town of Milford.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="026481_0294_0FD057B4378CFA50">Milford is &s;ituated on the ea&s;terly &s;ide of the county; and is bounded on the north, by Hop|kinton; on the ea&s;t, by Holli&s;ton, in the county of Middle&s;ex; on the &s;outhea&s;t, by Bellingham in the county of Suffolk; on the we&s;t, and &s;outhwe&s;t, by Mendon; and on the northwe&s;t, by Upton. It is &s;ituated &s;outhwe&s;t from Bo&s;ton, at the di&s;tance of thirty four miles; and from Worce&s;ter courthou&s;e, it is &s;outhea&s;t, di&s;tant twenty miles; and it is twenty five miles from Providence.</P>
<P>The town of Milford is not a level, champaign tract of land, neither yet is it very hilly and uneven; there is indeed, one large hill, a little from the centre of the town, to the &s;outhea&s;t, called Bear Hill. This is mo&s;tly very good land. The whole of the north part of the town is high and good land; it ri&s;es by a gradual a&s;cent; and from the highe&s;t places there is a large and varie|gated pro&s;pect; from the&s;e heights may be &s;een the Watchu&s;etts and Monadnock mountains, as al|&s;o the hills &s;outh of Bo&s;ton. This northern part was a purcha&s;e from the Indians, by the proprietors of the ancient town&s;hip of Mendon; and was com|monly called the North Purcha&s;e. This part is the mo&s;t di&s;tant from the meetinghou&s;e in Milford; and in this quarter, the &s;ectaries in the town have u&s;ually held their religious meetings. The northern and we&s;tern parts of the town, e&s;pecially, are rough and rocky; but the &s;oil is generally &s;trong and good; and well adapted to orcharding, gra&s;s and pa&s;tur|age, and &s;uffers but little by a dry &s;ea&s;on. They rai&s;e grain here of all kinds in &s;ufficient quantities

mo&s;t commonly for them&s;elves; but their articles of produce for market, are chiefly butter, chee&s;e, pork, beef, &amp;c. perhaps equal in quality to any in the county. There are but few mechanicks in the place, and &s;eldom more than two traders in Eu|ropean and India goods. The people &s;ub&s;i&s;t main|ly by the bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry, and are indu&s;tri|ous and good livers. The town is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain about as much as five miles &s;quare. There are 135 dwelling hou&s;es, and 840 inhabitants in the town, according to the late cen&s;us.</P>
<P>There are two rivers running through this town, from north to &s;outh, nearly parallel with each other, about one mile and an half di&s;tant, in &s;ome places not &s;o much; one on the we&s;t, the other on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town: The&s;e have their &s;ources in the high lands beforementioned, in the borders of Hopkinton. That on the we&s;t is called Mill River, the name by which this place was de|&s;ignated until its incorporation, this is large, run|ning through the ea&s;terly part of Mendon, it pa&s;&s;es to Providence. That on the ea&s;t is a principal branch of Charles's River, which &s;oon turns and runs ea&s;terly, and falls into the &s;ea in Bo&s;ton har|bour. Mill River is the outlet of a large pond, &s;aid to be a mile in length, partly in Milford, but principally in Hopkinton and Upton, called North Pond. There is another pond, a little more than a mile from the centre of the town, called Cedar Swamp Pond; this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all, though there be plenty of fi&s;h therein, as in the other; the branch of Charles's River &s;poken of above, runs directly through
<PB N="297" REF="026481_0296_0FD057B58BBCC2C0">
this pond. There are very good meadows, and in|terval lands upon the borders of both the rivers de&s;cribed before, as well as &s;mall pieces in other parts of the town, which are a &s;ingular advantage to the farmers. The town abounds in &s;prings, rivulets and brooks in all parts&punc; And on the riv|ers and &s;treams they have four gri&s;t mills, three &s;aw mills, one clothiers' works, and one trip hammer within the limits of Milford.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in this town is oak of all &s;orts, che&s;nut, walnut, &amp;c. there is very little pine or cedar at this day.</P>
<P>The roads in this town are not good, e&s;pecially for carriages; but they may be made in time, much better than at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We &s;hall clo&s;e our account of Milford, with mentioning, that in this place was born Alexander Scammell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who graduated at Harvard Univer|&s;ity, A.

<P>THIS was for many years, the &s;econd pari&s;h in Lanca&s;ter, and was commonly called <HI>Chock&s;et.</HI> It was made a &s;eparate pari&s;h in the year 1743, and remained united with Lanca&s;ter until April 25th, 1781, when it was incorporated by act of the Legi&s;lature, and received its pre&s;ent name, in compliment to Lord Sterling, of Newjer&s;ey, who &s;erved as a General in the American army, in the late war between Greatbritain and the&s;e United States. This is a large, populous, and wealthy town; is about &s;even miles in length, from north to &s;outh, and &s;ix in width from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It is &s;ituated about five miles from Lanca&s;ter, a little to the &s;outh of we&s;t, on the road to Princeton. It is bounded by Holden and Princeton on the we&s;t; eight miles from Holden, and &s;even from Prince|ton, &s;ix miles from Boyl&s;ton, which lies to the &s;outh of it; and from Leomin&s;ter, on the north, it is &s;even miles.</P>
<P>This town is rather hilly and uneven, though there is very little broken, or wa&s;te land in it. It is not very rocky, but a mo&s;t excellent, fertile &s;oil, producing in rich abundance, to repay the hu&s;|bandman for its cultivation. The high lands are excellent for all kinds of fruits, e&s;pecially apples; and here are large orchards; al&s;o, for gra&s;s and
<PB N="299" REF="026481_0298_0FD057B707D8CA00">
grazing; for the land is naturally moi&s;t, and by the help of the rivulets, the water may be turn|ed over the &s;ides of mo&s;t of the hills. As the town is very uneven, there is no extended pro&s;pect. Neverthele&s;s, the fertility of the &s;oil, the high de|gree of cultivation, and the inter&s;per&s;ion of hills and valleys, afford peculiar gratification to the eyes of ob&s;erving travellers. The meetinghou&s;e is in a valley; and on the road, in this valley, there is a large collection of trade&s;men and mechanicks and they are lively, active and indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>But the bulk of the people are large farmers, and, as the bounteous Author of Nature has ble&s;&s;ed them with a fruitful &s;oil, they have great encouragement to labour.

<P>There is but one river in the town, called <HI>Still River,</HI> from the &s;low motion of its waters; for after it enters this town, it runs in a vale for &s;ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral miles, with but a &s;mall de&s;cent. The waters which form this river, are furni&s;hed from three di&s;tinct &s;ources. The we&s;tern branch i&s;&s;ues from the foot of Mount Watchu&s;ett, in Princeton, and after various meanders, and receiving acce&s;&s;ions by &s;ev|eral rivulets, which originate in the ea&s;tern &s;ide of

The middle branch originates in <HI>Gardner</HI>'s <HI>Meadows,</HI> which are in the northea&s;tern part of Princeton; This is the large&s;t of the three branches; and carries &s;everal mills. The ea&s;tern branch which is called <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI>'s <HI>River,</HI> has its &s;ource in the &s;outhwe&s;terly part of Leomin&s;ter; and taking its cour&s;e, through ju&s;tice's Meadows, which lie on the we&s;t &s;ide of Ju&s;tice's Hill, and receiving &s;everal brooks, emp|ties it&s;elf into the main &s;tream, or <HI>Still River.</HI> Af|ter the confluence of the&s;e branches the river takes a &s;outhern direction along the we&s;tern &s;ide of Ster|ling, for &s;everal miles, until it enters Boyl&s;ton, thence taking a circuitous route through the we&s;ter|ly and northerly parts of Boyl&s;ton, lo&s;es its name in Na&s;haway, or Lanca&s;ter River. On the banks of this river in Sterling there is &s;ome pitch pine plain, &s;ome meadow and interval land.</P>
<P>There is one con&s;iderable &s;tream in the northerly part of the town, which running an ea&s;terly cour&s;e, empties it&s;elf into the north branch of Na&s;haway.</P>
<P>There are two con&s;iderable ponds in Sterling; one lies by the county road to Worce&s;ter; the other, a little to the &s;outhea&s;t of this: The&s;e are divided by a neck of land of about forty rods, in width, at the narrowe&s;t place; through this neck a &s;mall &s;tream runs, affording a pa&s;&s;age for the fi&s;h from one pond to the other. From the we&s;tern pond i&s;&s;ues a con&s;iderable &s;tream, &s;ufficient to car|ry
<PB N="301" REF="026481_0300_0FD057B88C562848">
a mill, which goes from November to May, but no longer, as the mill pond would flow a large body of meadow. The&s;e are called <HI>Wau&s;hacum Ponds:</HI> They are very deep in &s;ome places. Each pond, upon the mo&s;t exact computation, is about one mile, and a quarter in diameter. The ea&s;tern is the large&s;t; but the we&s;tern the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, on &s;everal accounts; as it is not &s;urrounded with hills like the ea&s;tern; and as it has in it an i&s;land, containing about half an acre of land, where fi&s;h|ing parties often repair to regale them&s;elves with fi&s;h, which the&s;e ponds afford in plenty.</P>
<P>There are two or three things, not to be forgot|ten in giving the hi&s;tory of Sterling: One is, that near the neck of land which divides Wau&s;hacum Ponds, on the &s;outh &s;ide, was formerly an Indian fort; and near this, there was a place where they buried their dead. The ruins of the fort, and the graves were very di&s;cernible, until within a few years pa&s;t, when by ploughing the ground tho&s;e ve&s;tiges of antiquity and barbari&s;m have di&s;appear|ed. On this very &s;pot was the palace, and Royal &s;eat of Sholan, Sachem of the Na&s;haways, and proprietor of Na&s;hawogg.</P>
<P>Another thing to be mentioned is this; that about three miles northwe&s;t from the meetinghou&s;e, on the road leading to We&s;tmin&s;ter, is a place called <HI>The Indian Fight,</HI> in con&s;equence of a mo&s;t bloody battle fought there between the Engli&s;h and Indians, on Augu&s;t 19th, 1707; the particulars of which we gave in the account of Lanca&s;ter, to which the reader is referred.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="026481_0301_0FD05059905DF8D0">A third thing not to be omitted, and a mo&s;t &s;or|rowful Providence indeed, is the burning of the hou&s;e of Mr. Jo&s;iah Wilder of this town in Janu|ary 1740; in which conflagration his wife, (preg|nant, and near the time for her delivery) with four &s;mall children be&s;ides, peri&s;hed; another child, a &s;on, the father plucked as a brand out of the burn|ing, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing a hole through the &s;ide of the hou&s;e, ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here the bed was, in which this child lay, and pulled him out thereat, while the room was full of fire and &s;moke. This child was almo&s;t &s;uffocated; but was &s;oon recovered and lived many years.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in Sterling is mo&s;t excel|lent, and of the following &s;orts, oak of the &s;everal kinds, walnut, che&s;nut, on the high lands; and the u&s;ual &s;orts in the low lands and &s;wamps, as birch, maple, a&s;h, &amp;c. The white pine timber is chiefly cut off, and there is not much pitch pine remaining, and at this day, but little of the yellow pine.</P>
<P>We proceed to give &s;ome account of the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical &s;tate of this town.</P>
<P>The church of Chri&s;t here, was imbodied on December 19th, 1744, and on the &s;ame day their fir&s;t mini&s;ter, the Rev. John Mellen, was ordained, who continued with them until December 14th, 1778, when his pa&s;toral relation to them, was di&s;|&s;olved, by mutual agreement. Soon after, the Rev. Mr. Mellen was in&s;talled pa&s;tor of the church and people at Hanover, in the county of Plymouth, where he continues to great acceptance. To Mr.

Mellen, &s;ucceeded in the &s;acred work of the min|i&s;try, the Rev. Reuben Holcomb, whereunto he was &s;olemnly &s;eparated on the 2d of June, 1779, and who &s;till continues their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>In Sterling died Mr. Seba&s;tian Smith, a native of old Spain, on the 24th of March, 1765, in an advanced age. He came young into this country and living a &s;ingle life, he devoted his con&s;idera|ble e&s;tate to pious and charitable u&s;es. Several years before his death he gave to the &s;ociety, a fo|lio Bible, that a portion of the holy &s;criptures might be read, on Lord's days, to the congregation. He gave much to the poor in his life time; and by will al&s;o: And likewi&s;e furni&s;hed the com|munion table, with two &s;ilver tankards; and gave one hundred pounds &s;terling as a fund for &s;chool|ing the more indigent children and youth. As &s;uch deeds come up as a memorial before God, &s;o they ought to be kept in remembrance among men.</P>
<P>Sterling is di&s;tant from Bo&s;ton, about forty &s;ix miles, nearly we&s;t; and from the courthou&s;e in Worce&s;ter, it is twelve miles a little to the north|ea&s;t. At the time of taking the cen&s;us in 1791, there were in the town 209 dwelling hou&s;es, and 1428 inhabitants.</P>

<P>ON the 13th of April, 1778, an act pa&s;&s;ed the General Court, incorporating a &s;econd pari&s;h in the &s;outh part of Bolton. And on the
<PB N="304" REF="026481_0303_0FD05799CB320EF0">
16th of March, 1784, this precinct was erected in|to a di&s;trict by the name of <HI>Berlin,</HI> at which time &s;everal families, with about five hundred acres of land, were added, from the northwe&s;t corner of Marlborough, and annexed to the county of Wor|ce&s;ter. Since that time, a few families have been added to this di&s;trict from the &s;outhea&s;t part of Lanca&s;ter. This di&s;trict is inve&s;ted with all the immunities and privileges of a town, excepting on|ly that of &s;ending a repre&s;entative to the General Court; but it has the liberty of joining with Bol|ton in the annual choice of repre&s;entatives. Here a church was imbodied, under the direction of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council, by a covenant bearing date April 7th, 1779; and on September 26th, 1781, the Rev. Reuben Puffer was ordained to the pa&s;|toral care thereof.</P>
<P>There is one pond in the ea&s;t part of the di&s;trict, called <HI>Gate</HI>'s <HI>Pond,</HI> nearly a mile in length, and from a quarter to half of a mile in width; it abounds in the u&s;ual pond fi&s;h; and a good &s;and is taken up near its &s;hores: No brook empties into it, but at the &s;outh end there is a &s;mall outlet, which falls into the river <HI>A&s;&s;abet.</HI> There is al&s;o a large &s;wamp, containing many hundred acres, ly|ing mo&s;tly within this di&s;trict: It is a low, &s;unken tract of land, but bears, however, &s;pruce of a great height, and in &s;ome parts of it, white pine timber. The mo&s;t valuable uplands are &s;eated on &s;everal hills, which afford excellent pa&s;turage and orch|arding. Wheat has been rai&s;ed on &s;ome of them to great advantage. One lies near the above
<PB N="305" REF="026481_0304_0FD057BD4D6EFED0">
named pond, and contains a number of very fine farms. The others are a broken range of hills, which, beginning about a mile &s;outh of the meet|inghou&s;e, run we&s;terly until they meet with North|borough hills, then &s;tretching in a northern direc|tion, cover, with a few inter&s;ections, all the we&s;t and north parts of the di&s;trict, and thus they con|tinue through Bolton and Harvard, to Littleton in the county of Middle&s;ex. A few of the bluff points of the&s;e high lands have been di&s;tingui&s;hed with arbitrary names, but no name applies to the whole range. The culture of hops has lately been introduced here, and by the experiments already made, bids fair to prove a profitable branch of hu&s;bandry. On the farm of the Hon. Samuel Baker, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in the northerly part of the di&s;trict, is found a quarry of mo&s;t valuable &s;tone, of a light gray colour, out of which that gentleman has built a hand&s;ome, large man&s;ion hou&s;e. The&s;e &s;tones are remarkable for an excellent quality which re|&s;i&s;teth the effects of fire.</P>
<P>The principal &s;tream, and the only one worthy of particular mention, is called <HI>Northbrook</HI>; it is formed of two &s;mall &s;treams, from the &s;outhwe&s;t, and northwe&s;t which uniting about a mile and an half we&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e, afford a convenient &s;eat for &s;aw and gri&s;t mills, where con&s;iderable bu&s;ine&s;s is performed. Taking thence a &s;outhea&s;terly direction, it runs upwards of two miles, through a large and rich interval, and after pa&s;&s;ing through the north|ea&s;t corner of Northborough, where there are al&s;o mills, it &s;oon falls into the river A&s;&s;abet at the

&s;outhea&s;t angle of the di&s;trict. Northbrook is from two to three rods in width, and of con&s;idera|ble depth; and formerly it yielded great quantities of the various &s;orts of fre&s;h water fi&s;h, but they are of late exceedingly dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ts of ninety two families, of which fourteen are of the &s;ect called quakers. The latter are mo&s;tly indu&s;trious, and &s;ome of them wealthy farmers.

<HEAD>GARDNER.</HEAD>
<P>GARDNER is a town which was taken from the towns of We&s;tmin&s;ter, Templeton, Winchendon and A&s;hburnham, and is accordingly bounded by them, in the following manner; by We&s;tmin&s;ter, on the &s;outh and &s;outhea&s;t; by Tem|pleton, on the &s;outhwe&s;t and we&s;t; by Winchen|don, on the north and northwe&s;t; and by A&s;hburn|ham on the northea&s;t.</P>
<P>It was incorporated, and made a di&s;tinct town on the 27th of June, 1785. It is not large in ex|tent,
<PB N="307" REF="026481_0306_0FD057BEDCA121D0">
its contents being about 14000 acres, but yet capable of making a good and wealthy town; hav|ing already 85 dwelling hou&s;es, and 530 inhabi|tants, according to the late cen&s;us.</P>
<P>The church in Gardner was gathered on the 1&s;t of February, 1786, and the Rev. Jonathan O&s;good was ordained as pa&s;tor thereof, October 19th, 1791.</P>
<P>This town was called Gardner to perpetuate the name and memory of the late famous Col. Thom|as Gardner of Cambridge, near Bo&s;ton, who was killed in the memorable battle upon Bunker's Hill, in Charle&s;town, on the 17th of June 1775, gallantly fighting in defence of the liberty and rights of his country.</P>
<P>The general face of this town is uneven, abound|ing in &s;mall hills and valleys; and though the land be &s;omewhat rocky, yet not in general, too much &s;o; the &s;oil is good, rich, &s;trong and fertile. It produces wheat, rye, Indian corn, barley, oats, flax, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is peculiarly adapted to gra&s;s and pa&s;turage, being naturally moi&s;t and abound|ing in &s;prings, rivulets, &s;treams, brooks and rivers, whereby they can water the lands at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>There is one river, called <HI>Otter River,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this river more particularly de&s;cribed in the account of Templeton.</NOTE> running from the &s;outh to the north; coming from Hub|bard&s;ton, through a part of Templeton to Gardner, it is &s;ome way a boundary between Gardner and Templeton, and, in Winchendon, falls into Miller's River. There are &s;everal brooks and &s;treams, with|out names, except two; the&s;e are called Pen Brook, and Spectacle Brook; all the waters run north|erly
<PB N="308" REF="026481_0307_0FD0579DACE86238">
and northwe&s;terly, and are finally emptied in|to Connecticut river. Upon the&s;e &s;everal &s;treams, and the river beforenamed, there are con&s;iderable bodies of good meadow land; and a number of &s;aw and gri&s;t mills; but no other water works at pre&s;ent. There are two large and fine ponds in the town, but without names; the&s;e have, each of them, &s;mall &s;treams running from them. They have here the u&s;ual artificers and traders; and here al&s;o are pota&s;h works.

There are two county roads leading through the town; the principal one, is that which leads from Connecticut river, through Peter&s;ham, Ger|ry and Templeton, on to Bo&s;ton.

<P>We &s;hall now attempt &s;ome de&s;cription of the town of Boyl&s;ton.</P>
<P>It lies in general, high, de&s;cending to the north, and northea&s;t; but the land is not &s;o high in the middle, and round about the meetinghou&s;e, as it is on the ea&s;t, &s;outh and we&s;t. It is rather hilly, rough and uneven; although there are &s;ome con|&s;iderable plains, covered with pitch pine. The hills on the ea&s;t &s;ide, adjoining to Northborough, are large and high, and pretty &s;teep where the road pa&s;&s;es; and although there is con&s;iderable broken land in the town, yet none but what is good for, and well covered with wood, of which there is a plenty. The wood which grows on the high and hard land, is of all the &s;orts of oak, &s;ome walnut, plenty of che&s;nut, &s;ome &s;a&s;&s;afras; in the &s;wamps and &s;wales, grow &s;ome a&s;h, birch, maple, &s;pruce, juniper, &s;ome white pine and &s;ome hemlock. The prickly a&s;h al&s;o, is a native of this place; it is a bu&s;h or &s;hrub, &s;eldom growing more than &s;ix or &s;even feet in height; though it grows in moi&s;t, yet not in cold land; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome &s;ingular qual|ities and virtues, and its bark and &s;eeds are highly e&s;teemed, and much u&s;ed, by Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="026481_0310_0FD057C189A8DAC8">The &s;oil in this town is generally good, rich and fertile. There are good arable lands; but it is very excellent for orcharding, for pa&s;turage and gra&s;s; and here are &s;ome of as large and good farmers, as perhaps any where in the county, who keep great &s;tocks of cattle. The people rai&s;e all kinds of country produce, e&s;pecially beef, pork, grain, butter and chee&s;e, va&s;tly more than they con&s;ume, and carry more into the market, than perhaps, any other town of its bigne&s;s and number. The town enjoys a fine healthy air, and the place has been famed for the longevity of its inhabitants. There are really no &s;tagnant waters. There are two ponds, but the waters are kept in motion by a current, in con&s;equence of inlets and outlets. Rocky Pond, &s;o denominated from its general &s;tony bottom, and more &s;tony &s;hore, is &s;ituated in the ea&s;terly part of the town from whence there is an outlet at the &s;outh end, into Cold Harbour Brook, and &s;o into the river A&s;&s;abet, in Northbor|ough. This is a fine pond for all kinds of &s;mall fi&s;h, e&s;pecially pickerel. It covers about thirty &s;ix acres of ground as appears from actual &s;urvey; and by the dam at the &s;outh end, the pond is rai&s;|ed &s;o as to cover thirty acres of meadow. Sewall's Pond, &s;o denominated from a family of that name, who owned the lands round it, lies in the &s;outh|we&s;t part of Boyl&s;ton, towards Worce&s;ter. This is large, covering a hundred acres of land perhaps, or more. It is well &s;upplied with all kinds of pond fi&s;h; there are two rivulets, from &s;prings which run into it, from the north and northea&s;t;
<PB N="312" REF="026481_0311_0FD057A08917F508">
and at the &s;outh is the large outlet, which cro&s;&s;ing the roads to Rutland and Worce&s;ter, in Shrew&s;bu|ry, falls into Quin&s;igamond, or Long Pond. There are three &s;mall brooks in the town, which originat|ing from &s;prings in Boyl&s;ton, run northerly into the &s;outh branch of the river Na&s;haway. Gates's Brook empties into the river in the we&s;t part of the town, near to Major Beaman's. Muddy Brook empties in about a mile we&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e. On this brook there is a &s;aw mill, and a body of meadow. Mill Brook, on which there is al&s;o a &s;aw mill, ri&s;es and falls into the river in the ea&s;terly part. The great &s;outh branch of the river Na&s;haway runs through Boyl&s;ton from the northwe&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ing &s;outhea&s;t|erly, till it comes within about a mile of the meet|inghou&s;e, then turns and runs northea&s;terly, into Lanca&s;ter. This river is formed by the junction of two large &s;treams or rivers. One comes from the ea&s;t &s;ide of Watchu&s;ett mountain, and pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;outherly part of Sterling, and called Still Water River, is, on the road at the bridge, the boundary between Sterling and Boyl&s;ton, and run|ning &s;outhea&s;terly about a mile in Boyl&s;ton, is joined by Quinepoxet Stream, &s;o called: This runs from a pond, called Quinepoxet on the &s;outh &s;ide of Princeton, partly in Holden, and running &s;outhea&s;t in Holden about two miles, turns and runs northea&s;t, until it joins Still Water, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Boyl&s;ton. After the confluence of the&s;e &s;treams, there are four large bridges, on the river within Boyl&s;ton; two of them are good, hand&s;ome &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng and well con&s;tructed. On the
<PB N="313" REF="026481_0312_0FD04FFD39888FB8">
we&s;t &s;ide of the town, after the two &s;treams unite, there is a &s;aw mill; al&s;o a corn mill with two pair of &s;tones; likewi&s;e a fulling mill, and clothiers' works, where a va&s;t deal of bu&s;ine&s;s is performed. In the northea&s;t part of the town, on this river, are two corn mills, a &s;aw mill, an oil mill, and fulling mill, together with a trip hammer, all clo&s;e togeth|er. The&s;e are famous for their con&s;truction, and for the work they do.</P>
<P>On this river, within the town of Boyl&s;ton, are large bodies of mo&s;t excellent and rich interval lands, to the number of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00 acres; about 1000 in one body. On the&s;e lands the people rai&s;e va&s;t quantities of Indian corn, flax, and &s;ome hemp, be&s;ides the immen&s;e quantities of hay and feed they yield. The wood yet remaining on the&s;e lands is butternut, buttonwood, &s;hagbark, &s;ome a&s;h and maple.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall eminence a little &s;outhwe&s;t from the meetinghou&s;e, which overlooks all the high lands in the town, called Diamond Hill, from the great number of &s;tones upon it which look like diamonds, and with which they have actually cut gla&s;s; and which might be of u&s;e and importance if properly attended to. There are, in &s;everal parts of the town, large quarries of &s;tone which are ea&s;i|ly dug up, and many of them &s;plit, of all &s;hapes, &s;izes, and lengths; they have excellent faces, for underpinning to hou&s;es, and for door &s;tones, and &s;teps, but they are too hard to admit of being much wrought upon. Many of them are of a great length, and far &s;uperior to any hewed &s;tones. It was

both plea&s;ing and a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee the collection of the&s;e &s;tones, in their natural &s;hapes, which they collected for the underpinning of the new meeting|hou&s;e they have lately erected.</P>
<P>Manufactories they have none, except of pota&s;h. Roads they have two or three called county roads of con&s;iderable travel, leading to Worce&s;ter, to Providence, and al&s;o to the Bo&s;ton market. The people &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by farming; and many of them are become very wealthy indeed. It may be &s;tyled a rich town, for they are not only clear of debt, but have &s;everal hundreds of pounds in their trea&s;ury, which, with proper management, would, in a few years, produce an adequate fund for the &s;upport of a publick teacher of piety, religion and morality. And if they continue united and peaceable, they will &s;oon vie with the town from whence they were taken; nay, they would &s;oon equal almo&s;t any of the towns in the county. There are 150 families in the place; and when the cen&s;us was taken, there were 840 inhabitants, A &s;ocial library has lately been e&s;tabli&s;hed here. It is in its infancy; but bids fair to be &s;omething con&s;iderable in a little time. Upon the whole, if this be not &s;o plea&s;ant a place as &s;ome others, the people are indu&s;trious and pro&s;perous, and there are &s;ure indications of wealth and independence among them; and they may be happy if it be not their own fault.</P>

<HEAD>GERRY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was taken chiefly from Tem|pleton, and as we &s;aid in our de&s;cription of that town, was &s;et off as a &s;eparate, or di&s;tinct pari&s;h, on the 16th of February, 1774. It lies on the we&s;t|erly &s;ide of Templeton, and between that and Pe|ter&s;ham. This pari&s;h, together with the &s;outhea&s;t|erly part of Athol, was incorporated with di&s;tinct town privileges October 20th, 1786, and had the name <HI>Gerry</HI> given it, out of re&s;pect to the Hon.

The &s;ettlement of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, with all the ordinances and in&s;titutions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in this place, was greatly retarded by the unhappy contro|ver&s;y between Greatbritain and the then Ameri|can colonies, and the war which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in 1775 and la&s;ted nearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight years.

<P>HAVING completed our account of the &s;everal towns in the County of Worce&s;ter, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the attentive reader ob&s;erved the town of Wood&s;tock was particularly named in the act for the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecting of this county, yet it has not been de&s;crib|ed

in this hi&s;tory. In order to give full &s;atisfaction upon this &s;ubject, the following account mu&s;t be &s;ubjoined. The &s;ettlement of the line of juri&s;dic|tion between Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut, though divers times attempted, was never fully ad|ju&s;ted until the year 1713. As early as the year 1636, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers upon Connecticut river re|moved from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country upon, and near the river on both &s;ides, from Springfield as low as Wethersfield, inclu&s;ive of both, and managed their affairs by virtue of au|thority from the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. However, the&s;e lands were claimed by the patentees of Connecticut. But, in 1638, the inhabitants of Springfield (which included what was afterwards called Suffield, below on one &s;ide the river, and En|field on the other &s;ide) having no doubt they were within the limits of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts patent, petition|ed the General Court that they might be &s;eparated from the other towns below, and be received and continued as part of the colony, which was granted, and juri&s;diction exerci&s;ed accordingly. In the year 1642, by order of the General Court, two per|&s;ons, Woodward and Saffery run the then prov|ince line. This line &s;eems to have been, for &s;ev|eral years, acquie&s;ced in. And in 1662, Mr. Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+throp obtained from king Charles II, a charter for the colonies of Connecticut and Newhaven unit|ed; the north line whereof is intended to be the &s;ame with the &s;outh line of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. From this time, until after the incorporation of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts by a new charter in 1691, we hear nothing
<PB N="319" REF="026481_0318_0FD057C6CA6D9610">
about bounds. In the year 1686, many of the in|habitants of Roxbury pitched upon a tract of land to &s;ettle upon, which was bounded on the &s;outh by Woodward and Saffery's line, and it was grant|ed to them by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government, and took the name of Wood&s;tock. After the new char|ter, Connecticut made a more &s;erious affair of what was called the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts encroachments. Af|ter various un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to compromi&s;e this matter, commi&s;&s;ions pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eals of each government with ample powers to &s;ettle the con|trover&s;y. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts were intent upon &s;e|curing the property to &s;uch per&s;ons to whom they had granted lands and the juri&s;diction of tho&s;e towns which had been &s;ettled by them. Suffield, Enfield and Wood&s;tock were the only towns which could be affected. Connecticut was al&s;o appre|hen&s;ive that part of the town of Sim&s;bury, which had been &s;ettled by that government, might fall within the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. It was therefore &s;ettled as a preliminary, that the towns &s;hould remain to the governments by which they had been &s;ettled, and the property of as many acres, as &s;hould ap|pear upon a balance to have been gained by one government from the other, &s;hould be conveyed out of other unimproved lands as a &s;atisfaction or e|quivalent; only, as there were about two miles which Wind&s;or claimed upon the town of Suffield, there having been a long conte&s;t between the&s;e two towns concerning the validity of the re&s;pective grants, it was agreed tho&s;e two miles &s;hould be|long to Connecticut if they fell within their line.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="026481_0319_0FD057A74A698AE8">"Nothing could be more equitable; nor tend more to the future peace and content of the inhab|itants of the conte&s;ted borders.</P>
<P>"It appeared, by the report of the commi&s;&s;ioners, that 107,793 acres of land were due from the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, who accordingly made a grant thereof to Connecticut. They accepted, and made &s;ale of the &s;ame; and applied the produce to the &s;upport of Yale College, and other publick u&s;es: And the controverted towns, for many years after, contin|ued without mole&s;tation under the juri&s;diction by which they were fir&s;t &s;ettled."</P>
<P>The foregoing account is given upon the author|ity and, chiefly, in the words of Governor Hutchin|&s;on, in his Hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>The lands granted to Connecticut were what are now called Pelham, Belchertown, &amp;c. in the coun|ty of Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>Though the lands were granted to Connecticut, the juri&s;diction thereof was to remain to Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts.</P>
<P>After this equitable and amicable &s;ettlement in 1713, Suffield and Enfield, in the county of Hamp|&s;hire, and Wood&s;tock, in the county of Worce&s;ter, were con&s;idered as belonging to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, were taxed by, and paid their taxes to this Common|wealth, and &s;ent repre&s;entatives to our legi&s;lature until the year 1748, when they revolted, and their repre&s;entatives were, by a bare majority, admitted to &s;eats in the General A&s;&s;embly of Connecticut. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, however, continued to tax them, (though they paid nothing) until the late revolu|tion,
<PB N="321" REF="026481_0320_0FD057C848A0C938">
when this Commonwealth cea&s;ed to claim them.</P>
<P>The lands of the&s;e three towns, undoubtedly, fell within Connecticut patent; and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts had no right to grant them away: Yet, after &s;o fair and equitable an agreement as was made between the two then colonies, and actual &s;atisfaction made by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts to Connecticut, it may be que&s;tioned, whether the inhabitants of tho&s;e towns acted gen|erou&s;ly and fairly in revolting, or the colony act|ed honourably in receiving them. Be the&s;e que&s;|tions an&s;wered as they may, by their revolt the line between the two States is now a &s;traight line, running due we&s;t, from the northwe&s;t corner of Rhodei&s;land, until it meets Newyork State line.&mdash; Thus ends the hi&s;tory of Wood&s;tock.</P>

<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given an account of each town, I will &s;ubjoin a particular de&s;cription of the &s;everal rivers, beginning at their &s;ources, and fol|lowing them to the Atlantick ocean.</P>
<P>Beginning at the north part of the county, the fir&s;t is Miller's River, or Payquage River.&mdash;This has, properly, two &s;ources; the principal &s;ource of it is a large pond, called Monomenock Pond, lying mo&s;tly in Rindge, in the &s;tate of Newhamp&s;hire, partly in Winchendon. The other &s;ource is a pond in A&s;hburnham, called Naukheag. The&s;e two branches, with various &s;treams and rivulets from the adjacent country, which fall into them, unite in the northea&s;terly part of Winchendon, and form Miller's River, which runs an almo&s;t we&s;ter|ly cour&s;e through the &s;outhea&s;terly part of Royal|&s;ton, Athol, and between Wendell and Erving's land, and falls into Connecticut River between the towns of Northfield and Montague. Part of the waters of A&s;hburnham, Templeton and Gerry, and all of Gardner, Winchendon, Royal&s;ton and Athol, pa&s;s into this river. It is a large and beautiful &s;tream, though in &s;ome places very rapid. This Mrs. Rowland&s;on cro&s;&s;ed while a captive with the In|dians. In her narrative &s;he calls it <HI>Bayquage River.</HI> By a late act of cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a number of gentlemen are made a body corporate, for the purpo&s;e of build|ing a bridge over this river near its mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="026481_0322_0FD057C9C7CD73A8">In the next place, a large branch of Souheagan River originates in A&s;hburnham; this runs north|ea&s;terly through A&s;hby, at the northwe&s;t angle of the county of Middle&s;ex; then into Newip&s;wich in the State of Newhamp&s;hire, through Ma&s;on, Am|her&s;t, and between the towns of Merrimack and Litchfield is emptied into Merrimack River. This is a large &s;tream, having its waters continually augmenting, by various &s;treams, before it falls in|to the river Merrimack.</P>
<P>The third in our cour&s;e is the river <HI>Na&s;haway.</HI> This is formed by the junction of two main branches. The north branch comes, partly, by a &s;tream from &s;prings in A&s;hburnham, and runs &s;outhea&s;terly into Fitchburg; and, partly, from Watchu&s;ett Pond on the north &s;ide of that moun|tain, which &s;tream runs northerly, through the ea&s;terly part of We&s;tmin&s;ter, into Fitchburg, and there unites with the &s;tream from A&s;hburnham; then turns and runs &s;outhea&s;terly through Leom|in&s;ter into the middle of the town of Lanca&s;ter within a few rods of the meetinghou&s;e. The &s;outh branch of the Na&s;haway is al&s;o compo&s;ed of two &s;treams: One from the ea&s;t &s;ide of Watchu&s;ett Mountain runs &s;outhea&s;terly, through the &s;outh|we&s;terly part of Sterling, into the edge of Boyl|&s;ton; this is called Still River. The other comes from Quinepoxet Pond, partly in Holden, and runs northea&s;terly into Boyl&s;ton, and uniting with Still River, on the we&s;terly &s;ide of Boyl&s;ton, con|&s;titutes the &s;outh branch of Na&s;haway. This con|tinues an ea&s;terly cour&s;e until it comes within a
<PB N="324" REF="026481_0323_0FD057AA4BC7BF40">
mile and a half of Boyl&s;ton meetinghou&s;e; then it takes a northea&s;terly direction, through the &s;outh|erly part of Lanca&s;ter, and there, in about half a mile ea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e, forms a junction with the north branch. After the confluence of the&s;e two main branches, the river Na&s;haway runs northea&s;terly, between Lanca&s;ter and Harvard, and between Harvard and Shirley, into Groton and Pepperell in the county of Middle&s;ex, then into Hollis, in the State of Newhamp&s;hire, and through Dun&s;table, and there falls into the river Merrimack. Na&s;haway is the large&s;t and fine&s;t river which originates in the county of Worce&s;ter, and has the mo&s;t rich and valuable interval and meadow lands upon its borders.</P>
<P>The next river we &s;hall de&s;cribe is <HI>Ware River</HI>; this originates in Gerry from a pond, and run|ning ea&s;terly into Templeton, joins another &s;tream, and runs &s;outh into Hubbard&s;ton, from thence in|to Barre; and then it becomes a boundary between Hardwick and Newbraintree, and receiving Swift River from Peter&s;ham, it pa&s;&s;es through the towns of Ware and Belchertown, and King&s;ton, and re|ceiving Quaboag River, which comes from Brook|field, it thence takes the name of Chicabee, and falls into Connecticut River in the north part of the town of Springfield. The waters of Gerry, part of the waters of Templeton and Princeton, all the waters of Hubbard&s;ton and Peter&s;ham; of Barre and Newbraintree; part of the waters of Rutland, Paxton, Leice&s;ter and Spencer; and all
<PB N="325" REF="026481_0324_0FD057CB4736D128">
of Brookfield, are emptied into Connecticut River, in the town of Springfield.</P>
<P>The river Quinebaug ri&s;es in the town of Brim|field, in the county of Hamp&s;hire, and runs ea&s;t into the county of Worce&s;ter, through Sturbridge and Charlton, and then, &s;outhea&s;t, through the we&s;terly part of Dudley, and &s;o on into the State of Connecticut, where it joins French River.</P>
<P>French River has its principal &s;ource in Holden, and runs &s;outherly through Worce&s;ter and Ox|ford, and the ea&s;terly part of Dudley, then pa&s;&s;es into the State of Connecticut, through Killing&s;ley, Pomfret, Canterbury to Norwich, where joining other rivers, it takes the name of Thames River, and falls into the &s;ea, or Longi&s;land Sound, at Newlondon. Hence, the waters of Sturbridge, Charlton, Dudley, Oxford, and part of the waters of Holden, Worce&s;ter, Leice&s;ter, and Spencer, are emptied into the &s;ea at Newlondon.</P>
<P>Black&s;tone River ri&s;es in the town of Sutton, and fir&s;t runs northwe&s;t through Ward into Wor|ce&s;ter, and takes in various &s;treams and rivulets in its cour&s;e, then it turns and runs &s;outhea&s;t, and receiving the river which comes from Shrew&s;bury Long Pond, it pa&s;&s;es through Grafton, North|bridge and Uxbridge, into Rhodei&s;land State, where with its various acce&s;&s;ions of Swift River, We&s;t River, and Mumford's River, it takes the name of Pawtucket, or Narragan&s;ett River, and pa&s;&s;es to Providence. All the waters of Sutton, Ward, Doug|la&s;s, Northbridge, Uxbridge, Upton, and part of the waters of Worce&s;ter, Shrew&s;bury, Milford

Mendon and Grafton, pa&s;s to Providence, and &s;o on to the &s;ea below Rhodei&s;land.</P>
<P>The river A&s;&s;abet has its &s;ource in Grafton, and running acro&s;s the northwe&s;t angle of We&s;tbor|ough, enters Northborough in the &s;outhwe&s;t part of the town, and running about half of a mile ea&s;t of the meetinghou&s;e, pa&s;&s;es off through the northwe&s;t angle of Marlborough, and running through the &s;outhea&s;terly part of Stow, and the &s;outh part of Action it enters the we&s;terly part of Concord, re|ceiving various &s;treams and rivulets in its progre&s;s, and there is called the north branch of Concord River. All the waters of Northborough, and part of tho&s;e of Grafton and We&s;tborough, and of Shrew&s;bury, Boyl&s;ton and Berlin, pa&s;s in this riv|er A&s;&s;abet. The &s;outh branch, or Sudbury River, ri&s;es from a pond, and a large Cedar Swamp, in the &s;outhea&s;t part of We&s;tborough, runs into Hopkin|ton, is the boundary between Southborough and Hopkinton, then pa&s;&s;es through the middle of the town of Framingham into Sudbury, and &s;o to Con|cord, running a northea&s;terly cour&s;e, and about one mile northwe&s;t from Concord meetinghou&s;e, joins the north branch, then taking the name of Concord River, it pa&s;&s;es through the northwe&s;t part of Bedford, and through the town of Billeri|ca, about half of a mile we&s;t from the meeting|hou&s;e, and between Chelmsford and Tewk&s;bury, falls into the river Merrimack. On the north &s;ide of Merrimack, are part of Tyng&s;borough, the towns of Dracut, Methuen, Haverhill, Alm&s;bury, and Sali&s;bury: On the &s;outh &s;ide, are the other part
<PB N="327" REF="026481_0326_0FD057CE1E1F6D00">
of Tyng&s;borough, and the towns of Chelmsford, Tewk&s;bury, Andover, Bradford, Newbury and Newburyport, where this river falls into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Charles's River has its proper &s;ource in Hopkin|ton, and runs &s;outh into Milford and Mendon, then turning, runs &s;outhea&s;t, through a part of Bellingham, then takes a northea&s;terly cour&s;e through the other part of Bellingha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and Med|way, and is the boundary between Franklin and Medway, as al&s;o between Medfield and Sherburne, and then pa&s;&s;es through Natick and Needham, and between We&s;ton and Waltham, on the north, and Newtown on the &s;outh; it al&s;o runs through Watertown, about half of a mile &s;outh of the meetinghou&s;e, then into Cambridge, about half of a mile &s;outh of the College, and &s;eparating Rox|bury from Cambridge, and Bo&s;ton from Charle&s;|town, it falls into the &s;ea in Bo&s;ton harbor. Thus all the waters of the county fall into the rivers Merrimack, Connecticut, Newlondon, Providence and Charles's River. The height of land is in the towns of A&s;hburnham, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Princeton, Holden, Paxton, Leice&s;ter, Spencer and Stur|bridge; on the we&s;t of the&s;e towns, all the water runs into Connecticut River only. In A&s;hburn|ham the water runs three ways, we&s;t, northea&s;t, and &s;outhea&s;t: In We&s;tmin&s;ter and Princeton the water runs ea&s;t and we&s;t; from Shrew&s;bury and Grafton, the water runs to Providence and Merrimack Rivers; very little pa&s;&s;es out of this county into Charles's River.</P>
