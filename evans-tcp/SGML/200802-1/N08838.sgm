<HEAD>The Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>T<HI>HE writers upon the new &s;cheme of ortho|doxy, do generally mix, in the compo&s;ition of their di&s;cour&s;es, a large proportion of fal&s;e metaphy&s;ics, by which, common readers are be|wildered and lo&s;t, as in a fog; and twi&s;t in, truth and fal&s;ehood together, in &s;uch a manner, that many of their readers don't know how to &s;eparate them; and though &s;omething &s;eems to them to be wrong, yet they can hardly tell what it is, and &s;o are in danger of being drawn, and many are actually drawn in, to embrace the errors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e errors, in their con&s;equences, have a mo&s;t pernicious, practical influence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sundry gentlemen of good judgment, and mo|ral ta&s;te, conver&s;ing on this &s;ubject, have ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to have &s;uch a kind of di&s;cour&s;e publi&s;hed as the following, which in their opi|nion, would tend to convince men, endowed with common &s;en&s;e, more effectually than laboured,
<PB N="iv" REF="011286_0003_0F869D3905AF0848">
metaphy&s;ical rea&s;onings, in imitation of the man|ner of the advocates for the errors of the day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author of the following di&s;cour&s;e has no other view in it than to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who need &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;ee, in an ea&s;y and &s;triking light, the fal&s;ehood and evil tendency of the new &s;y&s;tem, that they may be guarded again&s;t the fa|tal &s;nare.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He has no de&s;ign or wi&s;h to bring any di&s;ho|nour upon the Gentlemen who have appeared in defence of the&s;e doctrines, but is benevolent to them; and would gladly have foreborn the mention of any Gentleman's name, if he could con&s;i&s;tently. But he is &s;en&s;ible that benevo|lence to individuals is of right, &s;ubordinate to public benevolence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e good Gentlemen are certainly men of good abilities. 'Tis a benevolent wi&s;h that they may be directed to employ them in the cau&s;e of truth only, and in particular, in detecting and confuting the unhappy mi&s;takes they have been intangled in.</HI></P>

<P>I would particularly ob&s;erve here, That <HI>light</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> or the <HI>word of God</HI> is not, in <HI>any degree,</HI> the <HI>means by which</HI> this change is effected.

<PB N="16" REF="011286_0015_0F869D44AE63BF68">
the &s;inners impotence, as his ca&s;e is de&s;cribed, by the&s;e writers, is not moral, but natural or phy&s;ical, that this gentleman has admitted very wrong ideas of moral impotence; and that by correcting them, and rightly &s;tating the notion of moral impotence, as di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from natural, his building will appear to be founded upon loo&s;e &s;and. But it is not my pre&s;ent de&s;ign to enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I need not add any more quotations upon this &s;cheme. Tho&s;e already given are &s;uffi|cient to give a clear idea of it. I now proceed to the propo&s;ed application of the doctrines, in an addre&s;s and exhortation to the unrege|nerate, &s;uch as the doctrines will warrant and &s;upport; and will be careful not to &s;ay any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with them, however con|&s;i&s;tent it might be with the go&s;pel of God: For I am not now to apply the doctrines of divine revelation to the con&s;ciences and hearts of men, but apocriphal doctrines to their un|der&s;tanding, by which means they may ea&s;ily perceive them to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Poor, unhappy men; I &s;peak now to the unregenerate, if you have admitted the doc|trines above narrated as divine truths, I pity you; you are mi&s;erably entangled: But you mu&s;t admit their con&s;equences: for the ge|nuine con&s;equences of doctrines are as true as the doctrines them&s;elves. Truth is always &s;elf-con&s;i&s;tent throughout.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011286_0016_0F869D4505990778">
If the doctrines above mentioned are true, you are indeed in a mo&s;t dreadful condition, and may well be filled with horror and amaze|ment.&mdash;It is indeed true, upon this &s;cheme, that if you truly repent, and believe and love the go&s;pel of God, you &s;hall be received to &s;avor. Shall I then exhort you hereto? I could con&s;i&s;tently do it, upon the go&s;pel plan, but upon this &s;cheme I cannot, unle&s;s you are fir&s;t regenerated; for, antecedent thereto, 'tis ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould &s;ee the moral beauty and glory of the law and go&s;|pel, &s;o as to be drawn to faith and repentance by means thereof; nay you can't but hate them and reject them with perfect abhorrence, Such is the character of your nature, as you receive it by natural generation. And it is wholly out of your power to alter it for the better. This can be effected only by the im|mediate, miraculous, power of the &s;pirit of God without means. Your inability to be|lieve and repent, unle&s;s you are fir&s;t regene|rated, is therefore truly natural, and ab&s;olute, and unconquerable by any power, even by that of the &s;pirit of God. To command and exhort you to believe and repent before you are regenerated and have a new heart given you, is therefore ju&s;t the &s;ame as to require and exhort a man born deaf to reli&s;h the har|mony of good mu&s;ic before his ears are open|ed, or a man born blind to &s;ee and admire
<PB N="18" REF="011286_0017_0F869D45C130B000">
the beauty and glory of the vi&s;ible creation, before his eyes are opened, or he has given him a faculty of &s;eeing this beauty. Such a command and exhortation to the naturally and incurably deaf and blind, under a &s;hew of compa&s;&s;ionate good will, and accompanied with threatenings of the mo&s;t terrible puni&s;h|ment if they obey not, would ju&s;tly be e&s;teem|ed by all men, a mo&s;t in&s;olent and cruel in&s;ult upon their mi&s;ery, accompanied with the ba&s;e&s;t hypocri&s;y.&mdash;So you &s;ee I am re&s;trained, by this &s;cheme of doctrines, that I can't con|&s;i&s;tently, and without great ab&s;urdity, expect or exhort you to believe and repent, unle&s;s you are fir&s;t regenerated.</P>
<P>Shall I then exhort you to become new born, and get a new heart and a good ta&s;te, that you may become able to &s;ee and reli&s;h the moral beauty and excellence of the law and go&s;pel of God, and &s;o believe and repent? Alas! you are under a natural, and unconquer|able inability to this. The &s;pirit of God mu&s;t fir&s;t implant in your hearts a new &s;piritual ta&s;te, by an immediate, creating act of almigh|ty power. To exhort you in this manner, antecedent to the exertion of this creating act of divine power, would be equally ab&s;urd as to exhort a child unbegotten, not yet con|ceived in the womb, to come forth, and be born, and behold the glorious light of this world; or to have exhorted blind Bartimeus

<P>Poor, unhappy &s;ouls, what advice &s;hall I give you then? Shall I exhort you to attend diligently and earne&s;tly the in&s;tituted means of grace and regeneration, in hope that God will, in this way of your &s;eeking him, cau&s;e his &s;pirit to breath new life into your &s;ouls? Shall I exhort you to &s;ubmit to his influence, and &s;truggle, and &s;trive under it, for the new birth? I could readily give you &s;uch an ex|hortation, upon the go&s;pel &s;cheme; but upon this, how am I entangled, and perplexed, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for you! <Q>Man is &s;o far from vo|luntarily falling in with, or &s;ubmitting to the divine operation, or co-operating with the &s;pirit of God, in this work, that the whole &s;trength of his heart oppo&s;es, until it is effected and actually takes place.&mdash;This change is not effected by light, or by any medium or means whatever. So far from this, that the more any one is enlightened and convinced, and &s;trives, antecedent to this change, the more does he hate and ab|hor the &s;aving truth.</Q> In &s;o fal&s;e a light does it nece&s;&s;arily appear to the unrenewed mind. How then can your wicked endea|vours and &s;trivings for, or rather again&s;t the new birth help you? Or how can they be a means to this end, unle&s;s the &s;pirit of God loves to be re&s;i&s;ted, and is <HI>plea&s;ed in being

<P>But Mr. Hopkins &s;ays, though you do grow much wor&s;e in the u&s;e of means, yet there is <HI>great</HI> and <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> incouragement to continue in the earne&s;t u&s;e of them. For without this you can't obtain that mea&s;ure of doctrinal knowledge, without which God does not or|dinarily regenerate men. He gives this rea|&s;on of it, viz. That if God &s;hould regenerate &s;inners before they have attained a good de|gree of &s;peculative knowledge, the new crea|ture would have no food to feed upon, but mu&s;t lie dormant in the heart and wholly unactive. See his di&s;cour&s;e on the promi&s;es, p. 129&mdash;133, and &s;ermon on John 1. 13. p. 54&mdash;59.

But take his own words, and judge for your&s;elves. <Q>When God gives a new heart in regeneration a <HI>foundation is laid in the mind for di&s;covering</HI> the truths of the go&s;pel in their real beauty and excellence, to which the unregenerate heart is <HI>wholly blind.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cour&s;e on the promi&s;es, p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> <HI>By this</HI> the way is <HI>prepared</HI> for the light to have <HI>acce&s;s</HI> to the mind &s;o as to become <HI>the means of any ef|fect.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>&mdash;The work of the Spirit of God, by which per&s;ons are regenerated&mdash;lays the <HI>only foundation</HI> for holy exerci&s;es of heart.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>&mdash;It is (in) the exerci&s;e of a right or good ta&s;te only, (given in regeneration) that the things of the Spirit of God are &s;een, which are the objects of faith, and in the di&s;cern|ing of which faith con&s;i&s;ts.

But every thing of this kind is given in to the mind after the new creature is formed.&mdash;You will tell me, this is but poor encouragement, and does not at all relieve your minds from the di&s;courage|ment you was thrown into before; and that you can't under&s;tand it, that you &s;hould be re|quired to go through a painful cour&s;e of means, which make you more wicked, in providing food for the new creature, when you don't know that he will ever be born,

and do know that he will never reli&s;h your provi&s;ions, but will have better food provided for him when he is born.&mdash;I an&s;wer, it is &s;uch incouragement as the doctrine before you can give: and Mr. Hopkins &s;ays it is <HI>enough,</HI> tho' there is no kind of connection between the means and the end.</P>
