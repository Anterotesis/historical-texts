<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HEAD>
<P>MISS Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, the &s;ubject of this Hi&s;tory, was the younge&s;t daughter of James Harlowe, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> and was adorned with great per&s;onal charms, and &s;uch perfections, as rendered her the &s;ubject of general admiration. Her father was a gentleman of a rigorous, inflexible temper, and extremely tenacious of his authority as a hu&s;band and a parent. Her mother was a lady of a mild and gentle di&s;po&s;ition; but too much over-ruled by her lordly hu&s;band and imperious &s;on, who left her little power

of exerting the fine qualities &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. This &s;on was of a proud untractable, un|forgiving temper&punc; his &s;i&s;ter Arabella great|ly re&s;embled him in her di&s;po&s;ition, and as &s;he was not di&s;tingui&s;hed either by her beau|ty or accompli&s;hments, it is no wonder that her &s;i&s;ter Clari&s;&s;a, who was univer&s;ally belov|ed, &s;hould be the object of her &s;ecret jeal|ou&s;y and di&s;like: but &s;he had another rea|&s;on for her aver&s;ion&punc; her grandfather had left Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a a hand&s;ome e&s;tate, with a very elegant building <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Dairy-hou&s;e, and enjoined his &s;ons not to di&s;pute it with her. This e&s;tate, however, rai&s;ed ill blood in the family; though the mild and chari|table, humble and unambitious Clari&s;&s;a, re|&s;igned it to her father's management, which for a time prevented tho&s;e heart-burnings from breaking out, which her brother and after were unable to &s;tifle.</P>
<P>While Mr. James Harlowe, Clari&s;&s;a's broth|ers was gone to Scotland, Lord M&mdash;inform|ed their uncle, Mr. Anthony Harlowe, that Mr. Lovelace, his nephew, was de&s;irous of entering into an alliance with the family, and that gentleman, who was a gay young rake, was admitted to pay his re&s;pects to Mi&s;s Arabella, while Clari&s;&s;a was from home at the Dairy-hou&s;e. The next day Mi&s;s Ara|bella paid her a vi&s;it, and let her know that
<PB N="7" REF="029413_0005_0FE0F024668BBCA0">
&s;he was highly plea&s;ed with this event; though &s;he lamented that he was wild, and fond of intrigues; but took notice that he was young, and a man of &s;en&s;e. At the next vi&s;it &s;he liked him &s;till better; but though he afterwards made her &s;everal oth|ers, he avoided all particular declarations; a conduct which Mi&s;s Bella attributed to ba&s;h|fulne&s;s, and grew extremely fond of a mod|e&s;t man: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, on his &s;till continuing &s;ilent on a &s;ubjec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> that lay near her heart, &s;he at length grew offended. Mr. Lovelace, who in every thing behaved with the utmo&s;t art, took the opportunity of his &s;eeing her angry to urge his &s;uit; when &s;he told him that &s;he had no inclination to change her con|dition, and was quite happy as &s;he was. This Mr. Lovelace re&s;olved to take for a final an&s;wer, and expre&s;&s;ing great concern at her re&s;olution, took his leave, and never more renewed his &s;uit. Mean while Mi&s;s Bella, who was greatly di&s;appointed, made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and pretended to be extremely glad that &s;he had rejected him.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, &s;ometime after returning into the country, paid a vi&s;it to the family, profe&s;&s;ing that he was very de&s;irous of cul|tivating a friend&s;hip with it, though he had been &s;o unhappy as to be deprived of the hope of the wi&s;hed-for alliance; and the
<PB N="8" REF="029413_0006_0FE0F02A277735E0">
lovely and accompli&s;hed Clari&s;&s;a being now pre&s;ent, his attention was ob&s;erved to be entirely fixed on her; and the next day Lord M&mdash;making a formal propo&s;al in be|half of his nephew, Mr. Lovelace was per|mitted to continue his vi&s;its; though Cla|ri&s;&s;a's father had received a letter from his &s;on, wherein he charged Mr. Lovelace with gro&s;s immoralities, which induced him to &s;u&s;pend the declaration of his own mind till his &s;on's return; on which account Clari&s;&s;a would give him no opportunity of conver|&s;ing with her in private.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace now became very intimate in the family, though Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a never appeared to think his vi&s;its paid more to her than to the re&s;t. Mean while a young gentle|man under the care of Mrs. Harlowe's broth|er-in-law, being &s;oon to make the tour of Europe, and Mr. Lovelace, who had already made is, being able to give a good account of what was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for a young trav|eller to ob&s;erve, he was a&s;ked to oblige them with a de&s;cription of each country and court he had vi&s;ited; to which he con&s;ented, on condition Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a would direct his &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation was Mr. Lovelace with the family, when Mr. James Harlowe return|ed from Scotland, and being told of his
<PB N="9" REF="029413_0007_0FE0F02F920236D8">
vi&s;its, loudly expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbation. He had an inveterate hatred of Mr. Love|lace, that had ari&s;en from their frequent quarrels at college, where that gentleman had &s;ometimes ridiculed the haughty airs he a&s;&s;umed; and as Mr. James Harlowe never forgave what he thought an injury, he read|ily &s;eized this opportunity of &s;hewing his re|&s;entment. Mi&s;s Bella joined her brother from very different motives: &s;he boa&s;ted her having di&s;carded Lovelace, for which &s;he re|ceived the prai&s;es of her brother; and when they could not avoid &s;eeing him, their beha|vior was cold and di&s;obliging, and &s;oon de|generated into rudene&s;s. One day, on Mr. Lovelace's coming, young Mr. Harlowe ab|ruptly a&s;ked, what bu&s;ine&s;s he had with his &s;i&s;ter; on which the other &s;aid haughtily, he would an&s;wer a gentleman any way; but wi&s;hed he would not a&s;&s;ume &s;uch high airs, as he was not at college. Both their hands were on their &s;words; but a gentleman in|terpo&s;ing, the affair pa&s;&s;ed off for that time: but as Mr. Harlowe &s;eized every opportunity to in&s;ult Mr. Lovelace, they fought, and the former was wounded, and afterwards attack|ed by a &s;light fever; on which the whole family <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lamed out, laying all the blame on the innocent Clari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, who had generou&s;ly given
<PB N="10" REF="029413_0008_0FE0F03518855FD0">
the young gentleman his life, &s;ent three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to inquire after his health, and on the fourth came to pay him a vi&s;it, which was con&s;idered as an in&s;ult upon the whole family; and the father, though lame with the gout, could hardly be re&s;trained from meeting him &s;word in hand; while the en|gaging Clari&s;&s;a, terrified at this confu&s;ion, fell into a &s;woon, and, on her recovery, was cruelly in&s;ulted by her in&s;olent &s;i&s;ter. At length, Lovelace hearing of Clari&s;&s;a's illne&s;s, retired, vowing revenge.</P>
<P>As Lord M&mdash;was le&s;s inclined to blame his nephew than to take his part, the whole family were afraid of him, and though they believed that Clari&s;&s;a corre&s;ponded with him, their regard for their own &s;afety pre|vented their forbidding her. Mr. James Harlowe &s;oon recovered, when both he and his &s;i&s;ter, the one from deep-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ooted hatred, and the other from &s;lighted love, dete&s;ted the name of Lovelace; and re&s;olved to pre|vent all po&s;&s;ibility of his entering into an al|liance with the family, by having their &s;i&s;ter &s;peedily married. He propo&s;ed &s;everal gen|tlemen, but &s;he rejected them all; and yet had &s;uch influence over her father and uncles, who had hitherto &s;hewn great affection for her, as to be permitted to have &s;ome will of her own: but being now teazed and treated
<PB N="11" REF="029413_0009_0FE0F03A416FE3B0">
ill at home, &s;he intreated to be allowed to &s;pend &s;ome time with Mi&s;s Howe, her mo&s;t dear and intimate friend, which, notwith|&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of her brother, was granted.</P>
<P>She had been ab&s;ent near a month on this mo&s;t agreeable vi&s;it, when, without the lea&s;t notice, the chariot was &s;ent to fetch her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> home; &s;he was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, but immediately obeyed. On her return, her con&s;ternation was encrea&s;ed, at &s;eeing, in&s;tead of the plea&s;ure with which &s;he u&s;ed to be received, a &s;tiff formality <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it on all their countenances; and at her being ac|cu&s;ed of being in Lovelace's company, &s;he pleaded, that &s;he had never conver&s;ed with him alone, and that it did not become her to pre&s;cribe who &s;hould vi&s;it Mrs. Howe. To this her father an&s;wered, that &s;he had been too much indulged, and had refu&s;ed &s;everal gentlemen; but that it was now his turn, and he would be obeyed, and therefore in&s;i&s;ted on her con&s;enting to marry Mr. Roger Solmes.</P>
<P>This gentleman was deeply in love with her; but was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no one good qual|ity; yet was immen&s;ely rich. Clari&s;&s;a's generous heart ro&s;e again&s;t him, and &s;he loathed the wretch who was famed for his avarice and meanne&s;s. Her oppo&s;ition to
<PB N="12" REF="029413_0010_0FE0F040282B8DD8">
this di&s;agreeable propo&s;al expo&s;ed her to the mo&s;t mortifying in&s;ults from her brother and &s;i&s;ter, and the har&s;he&s;t treatment from her parents and uncles. She was neither permitted to go to church, nor to pay any vi&s;it, nor to appear before her father and mother. Her maid, who loved her, was turned away&punc; and Betty Barnes, a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rt &s;er|vant of her &s;i&s;ter's, &s;et over her. In &s;hort, &s;he had no other con&s;olation, but her corre&s;|pondence with Mi&s;s Howe; for being per|mitted to feed &s;ome Bantam poultry in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n old wood-hou&s;e, at the &s;ide of the garden, &s;he depo&s;ited her letters under a brick in a hole in the wall, that opened into a narrow lane; whither her friend's &s;ervant came for letters, and depo&s;ited his young lady's an|&s;wers in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s &s;he wrote &s;everal moving letters to her brother and &s;i&s;ter; but in re|turn received the mo&s;t bitter taunts and in|&s;ults, with &s;evere reflections on her &s;uppo&s;ed fondne&s;s for Lovelace. She al&s;o wrote to her father and uncles; but they all remained inflexible. In vain &s;he urged her aver&s;ion to Solmes, who, though he had a &s;i&s;ter in di&s;|tre&s;s, propo&s;ed to make over his whole e&s;tate to them, in ca&s;e he died without i&s;&s;ue by Clari&s;&s;a. Hence they alleged that her aver|&s;ion ought to yield to the aggrandizement
<PB N="13" REF="029413_0011_0FE0F042AD758708">
of the family, and the commands of a father, who having made no doubt of her compli|ance, had gone too far to recede; and there|fore &s;he mu&s;t and &s;hould be Solmes's wife.</P>
<P>While Clari&s;&s;a was involved in this di&s;|tre&s;s, &s;he was dreadfully frighted by the &s;ud|den appearance of Mr. Lovelace, who had entered the wood-hou&s;e in di&s;gui&s;e. How|ever, his re&s;pectful behaviour in this lonely place &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated her fears: but &s;he was in terror left he &s;hould be &s;een; &s;he therefore reproached him for the danger to which he expo&s;ed her, and was ha&s;tening from him, when, throwing him&s;elf at her feet, he in|treated her &s;tay for a few moments, de|claring that he had committed this ra&s;hne&s;s only to avoid a greater; he being no longer able to bear the in&s;ults he received from her family, while his forbearance would be at|tended with no other effect, than his lo&s;ing her for ever, by her being obliged to marry the object of her aver&s;ion. She an&s;wered, that no con&s;ideration &s;hould induce her to marry Solmes, &s;ince &s;he could, with great &s;incerity, declare for a &s;ingle life. Here, in|terrupting her, he expre&s;&s;ed his concern that after &s;o many in&s;tances of his tender and ob|&s;equious devotion&mdash;Clari&s;&s;a &s;topped him by a&s;king, Why he did not in plain words men|tion her obligation to him for his unwi&s;hed.
<PB N="14" REF="029413_0012_0FE0F0493189C340">
for per&s;everance, that &s;et all her friends a|gain&s;t her? She mu&s;t forgive him, he &s;aid, for pre&s;uming to hope for a greater &s;hare in her favour, when &s;o vile a reptile as Solmes was &s;et up as his competitor; and that, if &s;he was driven to extremities, his family would be proud of giving her their protection. In &s;hort, his behaviour increa&s;ed her confidence in him; and &s;he was &s;urprized to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that he &s;eemed as well acquainted with the cruel treatment &s;he met with as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Soon after this &s;he received a very affec|tionate letter from her mamma, in which were inclo&s;ed patterns of rich &s;ilks from London, for the choice of &s;everal &s;uits &s;he was to have on her marriage with Mr. Solmes, with orders to come and &s;hew her tho&s;e &s;he liked be&s;t&punc; but commanding her not to come into her father's or her pre&s;ence, if &s;he was &s;till re&s;olved to continue undutiful. Her aver&s;ion to Solmes made her look on the patterns with horror, and &s;he remained in her chamber, though reminded by Betty, (Mi&s;s Bella's pert maid,) that her papa and mam|ma waited for in her father's &s;tudy. In this perplexity &s;he &s;ent her intreaties to &s;peak to her mamma alone; but in return, received an angry letter from her father, that he would never &s;ee her more till &s;he was Mr. Solmes's wife.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="029413_0013_0FE0F04E6BFB3F30">
At this time her dear friend Mi&s;s Howe warmly advi&s;ed the re&s;umption of her e&s;tate; but Clari&s;&s;a, from a principle of duty, was aver&s;ed to any litigation with her father, even though by his barbarous treatment &s;he &s;hould be reduced to want. Mr. Lovelace paid that young lady a vi&s;it, in order to engage her intere&s;t with her friend: he complained of the repeated in&s;ults he received from the Harlowes, and, with an air of fiercene&s;s, told Mi&s;s Howe, that if Clari&s;&s;a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> forced to give her hand to Solmes, he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the world, and the world's cen&s;ures, &s;ince the menaces of the family and their triumph over him would warrant the utmo&s;t effects of his vengeance.</P>
<P>Clari&s;&s;a had ju&s;t received an account from Mi&s;s Howe of this vi&s;it, when her relations re&s;olved to force her to a compliance, by &s;ending her to a moated hou&s;e belonging to her uncle Anthony, where &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de|barred from writing to any one, and have no other vi&s;itors but Solmes and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arbarous brother and &s;i&s;ter. On this re&s;olution &s;he wrote warm remon&s;trances to her brother, and had the &s;pirit to add, that &s;he &s;hould think it hard to be compelled to go to any one's hou&s;e, when &s;he had one of her own, to which &s;he might retire. Soon after this let|ter was &s;ent, Mi&s;s Bella came up in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">:
<PB N="16" REF="029413_0014_0FE0F053F8126A78">
O &s;pirit, cried &s;he, is it come to this at la&s;t? You want to be independent, do you? My papa has lived too long for you!&mdash;Clari&s;&s;a was going to &s;peak, when rudely putting her handkerchief to her mouth, You have done enough with your pen, &s;he continued&punc; but your independent &s;cheme will not be granted: prepare this moment, for to-mor|row you go, depend upon it: 'tis determin|ed, child, you mu&s;t go to-morrow. Thus &s;he ran on, till Clari&s;&s;a, quite out of patience, cried, No more of your violence; talk in this manner to your &s;ervant; and let me tell you, I won't go to-morrow, except I am dragged away by violence. What, girl, re|&s;umed Bella, not if your papa and mamma command you? That command &s;hall come from their own mouths, returned Clari&s;&s;a, and not from yours; and &s;ay another word, let the con&s;equence be what it will, I will force my&s;elf into their pre&s;ence, and demand of them, what I have done to be thus treated&punc; Come along, child&mdash;come along, meek one, cried Bella; you'll find both your de&s;|pi&s;ed parents&mdash;I don't want to be led, re|turned Clari&s;&s;a; and &s;ince I can plead your invitation, I will go. She was ha&s;tening to the &s;tairs, but Bella locked the door; on which &s;he returned and went into her clo&s;et.</P>
<P>In the evening a letter was brought her
<PB N="17" REF="029413_0015_0FE0F05707019440">
from her &s;i&s;ter, in which &s;he was told, that her mamma had begged her off till the next week, but &s;he had done her bu&s;ine&s;s with the family; for, thanks to her &s;tubbornne&s;s, none would receive her but her uncle Anthony. Clari&s;&s;a &s;ent the copy of this epi&s;tle to her mother, with a &s;hort one of her own, de&s;i|ring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> know if &s;he was thus u&s;ed by hers or her father's order? &s;ince, if &s;he was, &s;he would &s;ubmit.

In &s;hort, it was re&s;olved, that within three days &s;he &s;hould go to her uncle Anthony's, which &s;he learned from an in&s;olent note written by her brother.</P>
<P>Clari&s;&s;a was in this perplexed &s;ituation, when &s;he received a letter from Lovelace, in which he ob&s;erved, that he had &s;omething of the utmo&s;t importance to communicate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her, and begged her to meet him in the gar|den, owning that he had procured a key, but was afraid of di&s;obliging her by coming without her leave; telling her al&s;o he was very ill of a cold he had caught by waiting in the coppice behind the garden in the mid&s;t of the rain.

She had no &s;ooner depo&s;ited her letter, than her heart mi&s;giving her, &s;he went to take it away; but Lovelace had been &s;o watchful, that it was already in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;This was Tue&s;day, and on Thur&s;day &s;he was to be carried to the moated-hou&s;e, from which there appeared no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape.

<P>Clari&s;&s;a, having obtained &s;o much time, revoked her appointment with Lovelace, de|&s;iring him to write what he had to communi|cate. In his an&s;wer, he complained, in very high terms, of her breaking her promi&s;e, and now appeared rather the haughty than the humble lover. Clari&s;&s;a, in her reply, ex|pre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e at the freedom of his re|proaches, and told him, that &s;he was &s;o much alarmed at this treatment, that &s;he de|&s;ired the la&s;t letter he had written might be

Mr. Lovelace took leave of his lady, as he called Clari&s;&s;a, the next morning, but fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ed her to accept of a bank note, which &s;he re&s;olutely refu&s;ed; but he left it on the table.

He, however, &s;till lodged in the hou&s;e with Clari&s;&s;a, who was too much in his power to hinder him.

communicated to her friend, who endeavour|ed to find her a convenient and &s;ecure re|treat, and at length informed her that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had found one; but Lovelace's behaviour now gave her hopes, though the&s;e were of &s;hort continuance.</P>
<P>The artful Lovelace, at length, prevailed on her to allow him to attend her to a play; and during their ab&s;ence, &s;everal of the wo|men were directed to &s;earch for Mi&s;s Howe's letters.

<P>Stung to the quick at the many reflections ca&s;t upon him in the&s;e letters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Lovelace now formed projects of revenge, and re&s;olved to u&s;e every art to bring the lovely Clari&s;&s;a to live with him on his own terms. Hence his tenderne&s;s became mingled with a &s;avage fiercene&s;s, which affrighted and alarmed her, Provoked by this ungenerous treatment, &s;he tore almo&s;t in two an an&s;wer &s;he had written
<PB N="42" REF="029413_0040_0FE0F0DBD0482EB0">
to &s;ome propo&s;als he had given her in rela|tion to the marriage articles; an an&s;wer that in the &s;tronge&s;t manner equally &s;hewed the noblene&s;s and delicacy of her mind, her vir|tue and prudence, and her duty and affec|tion to her relations. Finding that &s;he was deeply offended, Lovelace, in order to impo&s;e on her credulity, formed new &s;tratagems, in which he was &s;upported and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by wretches taught to act the part he directed. The hou&s;e he pretended to have taken had hitherto an&s;wered his purpo&s;e, as it had made Clari&s;&s;a contented to &s;tay with Mrs. Sinclair, whom &s;he di&s;liked; and he now put an end to tho&s;e expectations, by preten|ding that the imaginary widow Fretchville was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox. In order to gain upon the tender heart of Clari&s;&s;a, who ardently longed to be reconciled to her pa|rents, it was pretended that a reconciliation was &s;et on foot by an old villain, who called him&s;elf Captain Tomlin&s;on. This fellow was directed to form a plau&s;ible &s;tory of his having lately purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate in her un|cle's neighbourhood, with a view to &s;pend the la&s;t years of his life in the enjoyment of peace and retirement, where having contract|ed an intimate friend&s;hip with her uncle Mr. John Harlowe, he was informed of the whole unhappy affair, and told that overtures had
<PB N="43" REF="029413_0041_0FE0F0DE3A9EBE90">
been made for a reconciliation, and that her uncle, having calmly con&s;idered every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, had re&s;olved, in ca&s;e Clari&s;&s;a and Mr. Lovelace were actually married, to endeavour to procure a reconciliation be|tween them and her relations.</P>
<P>Lovelace u&s;ed the utmo&s;t art to prevail on her to own before this man that they were married; but in vain. She ob&s;erved, that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of her folly, in permitting the people of the family to remain in an er|ror and as her appearing in that character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his friends; and therefore the &s;ucce&s;s even of her deare&s;t hopes &s;hould not again engage her to countenance his fal&s;ehoods. Upon this he altered his plan. The &s;uppo&s;|ed captain appeared; and, by Lovelace's de&s;ire, &s;he overheard the di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;|&s;ed between them. In fine, &s;he was invited to breakfa&s;t with them; when, after a long conver&s;ation, in which he acted his part with &s;uch art, as to impo&s;e on Clari&s;&s;a, and en|gage her e&s;teem, he took his leave; and on Mr. Lovelace's return from attending him to the outward door, &s;he met him with a vi&s;i|ble complacency in her looks.

hold of the mo&s;t favourable moments, to make way, by little freedoms, for the ac|compli&s;hment of the greate&s;t: and when in the&s;e encroaching &s;teps, he boldly took &s;uch liberties as &s;hocked the delicacy of her vir|tue, a vi&s;it or a letter from Captain Tomlin|&s;on, to inform her of the mea&s;ures he and her uncle had taken to accompli&s;h this re|conciliation, was contrived to remove her re|&s;entment, and re&s;tore him to favour.

<P>Lovelace had no &s;ooner entered his apart|ment, than recollecting the opportunity he had lo&s;t, and repenting that he had let it &s;lip, he ha&s;ted back with the hopes, that through the di&s;tre&s;s of her mind, &s;he had not yet fa&s;tened the door, and was now fully re|&s;olved to execute all his purpo&s;es, let the con|&s;equences be what they would.

<P>Lovelace had no &s;ooner left the hou&s;e than Dorcas came to Clari&s;&s;a, and urged her to take &s;ome refre&s;hment. That lady was in tears, and her eyes &s;welled with weeping; &s;he &s;ighed as if her heart would break, and refu&s;ed either to eat or drink; but &s;oon af|ter ordered her to bring her three of four French rolls, a little butter, and a decanter of water; telling her, &s;he &s;hould not want her attendance. Dorcas con&s;ulted Mrs. Sin+clair about obeying her, who readily con|&s;ented that &s;he &s;hould, but that a bottle of Sherry &s;hould be added.

<P>The unhappy Clari&s;&s;a no &s;ooner recovered her &s;en&s;es, than &s;he bur&s;t into the bittere&s;t complaints, that &s;he was ruined and undone, and earne&s;tly intreated them to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to e&s;cape the dreadful evils in which &s;he &s;hould otherwi&s;e be involved. They preached pa|tience to her, and per&s;uaded her to lie down; but &s;he refu&s;ed and trembling &s;o as to be unable to &s;tand, &s;eek into am ea&s;y chair. Lovelace now hoped that &s;he was &s;o well recovered as to bear his pre&s;ence; but, on &s;eeing him, &s;he redoubled her exclama|tions, and be&s;ought him to leave her.

<P>Lovelace, on being joined by the&s;e wo|men, endeavoured to engage them in his in|tere&s;t, by giving them the hi&s;tory of his own

He &s;aid, they had been privately married, though &s;he had made him &s;wear to keep &s;eparate beds, and that &s;he obliged him to comply, in order to pre|vail on him to become reconciled to her re|lations. As Mi&s;s Howe had detected the bawd, to who&s;e hou&s;e he had carried Clari&s;&s;a, and might &s;till find &s;ome way to acquaint that lady with her di&s;coveries, he thought proper to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s them in favor of Mrs. Sinclair, and her two pretended nieces, by repre&s;enting them as very good people, and to paint Mi&s;s Howe as a perfect virago, who had no equal in contriving and exe|cuting mi&s;chief.

<P>In fine, Lovelace gained both Mi&s;s Raw|lins and the widow Moore over to his inte|re&s;t, and was even &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to prevail on the latter to accept him for her boarder and lodger; but Clari&s;&s;a &s;teadily refu&s;ing to lie in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him, he hired an apartment in the neighbourhood, and ob|tained leave for his &s;ervant to lie there, who had private orders to prevent Clari&s;&s;a's re|ceiving a letter from Mi&s;s Howe, or making her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moore and Mi&s;s Rawlins, on their return to Clari&s;&s;a, pleaded with that lady in

behalf of Mr. Lovelace; while &s;he, in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful terms, be&s;ought them to fa|vour her e&s;cape. Lovelace, who overheard what was &s;aid, and feared &s;he would remove the fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ions he had made on the minds of the&s;e &s;ober and mode&s;t women, in|terrupted their conver&s;ation; on which Cla|ri&s;&s;a complained of his intru&s;ion, and a&s;k|ed him&punc; if he would &s;ay before that lady and Mrs. Moore, that they were really married; adding, Lay your hand on your heart, and an&s;wer me, Am I your wedded wife?

Tomlin&s;on, of her uncle's having com|plied with both their wi&s;hes. In vain were all her endeavours to e&s;cape from him: &s;he grew perfectly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, was ready to faint, and forced to lean again&s;t the wain&s;cot, as he kneeled at her feet. At la&s;t a &s;tream of tears gu&s;hing from her eyes, Good Heaven, &s;aid &s;he, what will be my fate? Deliver me from this dangerous man!&mdash;I know not what I do, nor what I ought to do! Then turning from him, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair. He ro&s;e, and approached her with reverence, crying, My deare&s;t life!&mdash;when, with a face glowing with con&s;cious dignity, &s;he interrupted him by crying, Ungenerous, ungrateful Lovelace! you know not the value of the heart you have in&s;ulted! Nor can you imagine how much my &s;oul de&s;pi&s;es your meanne&s;s: but meanne&s;s mu&s;t ever be the portion of the vicious.</P>
<P>The women, thinking they were now likely to be on better terms, retired, though &s;he warmly oppo&s;ed their going. Lovelace then, bending his knee, begged her forgive|ne&s;s, promi&s;ing to behave for the future with the mo&s;t exact circum&s;pection; but &s;he could not tru&s;t his promi&s;es, and refu&s;ed either to dine with him, or to ta&s;te any refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>There dined with Mr. Lovelace and Mrs. Moore, a young widow, named Bevis, who
<PB N="68" REF="029413_0068_0FE0F16BAFBCC788">
was very forward, extremely lively, and &s;oon &s;hewed her&s;elf a great admirer of Mr. Love|lace. As &s;he was to &s;tay a month with Mrs. Moore, who was her aunt, he took great pains to prevail on her to &s;ide with him again&s;t Clari&s;&s;a, and repre&s;ented her affec|tionate friend Mi&s;s Howe as the cau&s;e of all their mi&s;under&s;tandings. In the mean time, the pretended Captain Tomlin&s;on com|ing in, a conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between them, which was &s;o managed, as to make every one pre&s;ent believe that he was really married to Clari&s;&s;a, and that Mi&s;s Howe, from her rage and jealou&s;y at his having &s;lighted her, took every opportunity to widen the difference between them. Lovelace now ob&s;erved, that he thought it high time to acquaint his &s;pou&s;e that Captain Tomlin&s;on was arrived; on which Mrs. Moore went up, and de&s;ired in his name that &s;he would permit him to &s;ee her; but &s;he begged to be excu&s;ed, on account of her being very ill; when the pretended captain, profe&s;&s;ing that he had much bu&s;ine&s;s on his hands, appeared great|ly vexed, and took his leave.</P>
<P>The captain was but ju&s;t gone, when Lovelace's &s;ervant brought him a letter from Mi&s;s Howe, in an&s;wer to one &s;he had re|ceived from Clari&s;&s;a, in which &s;he mentioned the agreeable news of her e&s;cape to Mrs.
<PB N="69" REF="029413_0069_0FE0F16F9D302330">
Moore's, with an account of the low plot of firing the hou&s;e to force her into Lovelace's arms, when &s;he had &s;ufficient proof of its being an infamous hou&s;e, &s;ince, though &s;he heard the women in the next room, they took no notice of her cries. Lovelace's &s;er|vant, being ordered to intercept Mi&s;s Howe's an&s;wer, had &s;topt the me&s;&s;enger, made him drunk, picked the letter out of his pocket, and carried it to his ma&s;ter, who finding means to read it without breaking the &s;eal, the &s;ervant took it back, and put it again into the fellow's pocket, who &s;oon after left the alehou&s;e, and mounting his hor&s;e, gave it into Clari&s;&s;a's own hand. Mi&s;s Howe, in this letter, congratulated her dear friend on her e&s;cape, and informed her of her be|ing under a great deal of concern about a letter of the utmo&s;t importance, which &s;he had before &s;ent, and would not have had fall into the hands of that abandoned rake, Love|lace, for the whole world. Clari&s;&s;a in&s;tantly applying to Mrs. Moore, told her that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he did not value the price, could a man and hor&s;e be engaged to go for a letter left for her at one Mr. Wil&s;on's in Pall-Mall. On which a poor neighbour was &s;ent, who re|turned the &s;ame evening with the letter; but it was not the &s;ame &s;ent by Mi&s;s Howe.
<PB N="70" REF="029413_0070_0FE0F175AD801DF8">
The important letter was that in which &s;he had laid open the plots of the treacherous Lovelace, and which he had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He had copied tho&s;e parts of it that were mo&s;t in his favour, omitting every circum|&s;tance that might induce her to think Sin|clair a bawd, and Tomlin&s;on an impo&s;tor; and, at the &s;ame time, had &s;o artfully imitat|ed Mi&s;s Howe's hand, that it was not ea&s;y to know the difference. The next day Cla|ri&s;&s;a wrote an an&s;wer, to let Mi&s;s Howe know that &s;he had received her letter, but deferred giving a farther account of her affairs till &s;he had a more compo&s;ed mind and le&s;s trembling fingers. This &s;he delivered to Mrs. Moore's maid, who being courted by Lovelace's &s;ervant, &s;he delivered it to him, to put into the po&s;t-office, and he carried it to his ma&s;ter, who immediately forged anoth|er, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was what &s;he would have written, had &s;he really received the in|telligence &s;ent her by her deare&s;t friend.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Lovelace behaved to her with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, pretending to be deeply concerned at his having offend|ed her. That &s;pecious villain Tomlin&s;on was introduced, and &s;everal intere&s;ting con|ver&s;ations pa&s;&s;ed between him, Lovelace, and Clari&s;&s;a, wherein no arguments were &s;pared to engage her confidence, and bani&s;h every

apprehen&s;ion of the de&s;igns he &s;ecretly form|ed again&s;t her. In the mean time, the dic|tates of his heart and of his con&s;cience fre|quently prompted him to endeavour to merit her favour, by laying a&s;ide all his wicked plots; but his libertine principles prevailed, and his pride and revenge getting the a&s;cen|dant, he re&s;olved to humble her virtue, and, before he married her, to bring her down nearer to his own level. By his in&s;idious arts he again prevailed upon her to allow him her company, and to &s;hew him &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for his well-di&s;&s;embled di&s;tre&s;s; but he could not engage her to come to any determination till &s;he had received another letter from her dear and only friend; and this he was determined to prevent, if po&s;&s;i|ble, and which indeed he effected with|out any great difficulty. One day, after his having a very tender and affecting con|ver&s;ation with her alone, a me&s;&s;enger arrived from Mi&s;s Howe with a letter, which he in|&s;i&s;ted on delivering into Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a's own hand; but &s;he being gone to church with Mrs. Moore, Lovelace prevailed on Mrs. Be|vis to per&s;onate her, and reclining on a couch, with her face muffled up, &s;he received the letter, and delivered it to Lovelace, who now found fre&s;h cau&s;e to rejoice that he had prevented her receiving it, for Mi&s;s Howe
<PB N="72" REF="029413_0072_0FE0F1802734BE40">
here confirmed her of what &s;he had before written of the infamous hou&s;e, and her rea|&s;ons for di&s;tru&s;ting the &s;pecious Tomlin&s;on; and, in &s;hort, had laid a plan for her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Lovelace, now finding him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of ha&s;tening his de&s;igns, procured two genteel women of the town to per&s;onate Lady Betty and his cou&s;in Montague, and having in&s;tructed them in their parts, had them brought to Mrs. Moore's in a hired coach and four, it being pretended that La|dy Betty's was new lining and repairing. Both of them were richly dre&s;&s;ed, and adorn|ed with jewels, hired for this purpo&s;e; and being attended by &s;ervants nearly in the &s;ame livery as Lady Betty's, it was impo&s;&s;ible for Clari&s;&s;a, who had never &s;een either of them, to &s;u&s;pect their being other than what they appeared. The more the&s;e pretended ladies conver&s;ed with her, the more fond they ap|peared to grow; they loaded her with ca|re&s;&s;es, cen&s;ured Lovelace, and congratulated them&s;elves on the happine&s;s they &s;hould re|ceive from his being allied to her, could they prevail on her to forgive him. Clari&s;&s;a was far from having the vanity to believe all the flattering &s;peeches they made her; yet hav|ing no &s;u&s;picion, &s;he was not di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;o favourable a beginning of an acquaintance, with ladies of whom &s;he had always heard honourable mention.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="029413_0073_0FE0F18411C41C68">
Mr. Lovelace treated his pretended aunt with great re&s;pect, and allowed her to have the advantage over him in the many lively repartees that pa&s;&s;ed between them; though Clari&s;&s;a ea&s;ily perceived he purpo&s;ely fore|bore that &s;martne&s;s which he never &s;pared &s;hewing to Mi&s;s Montague. The la&s;t-men|tioned lady behaved with &s;till more reverence to her aunt; while &s;he kept up the dignity of the character &s;he a&s;&s;umed, rallying both, of them with the air of a per&s;on con&s;cious of the &s;uperiority which her years and for|tune gave over tho&s;e who might be obliged to her either while living or at her death. The conver&s;ation, for &s;ome time, turned on their own family and the happine&s;s they &s;hould receive on Clari&s;&s;a's admi&s;&s;ion into it. They di&s;cour&s;ed on Lady M&mdash;'s and La|dy Sarah's earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee her; the ma|ny friends and admirers &s;he would have among them, and the happine&s;s of Lovelace. They launched out in prai&s;e of Mi&s;s Howe, and talked of a reconciliation and intimacy with all Clari&s;&s;a's friends, particularly with her mother; giving that lady all tho&s;e prai&s;|es that were univer&s;ally allowed to be her due; while Clari&s;&s;a, delighted with hearing &s;o many agreeable things, almo&s;t forgot her re&s;entment again&s;t Lovelace.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="029413_0074_0FE0F18AA10A9670">
As there were accommodations in the hou&s;e for Lady Betty and Mi&s;s Montague, it was agreed that they &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e there that night; but the Lady Betty recollecting that &s;he mu&s;t go to town, ordered her coach to the door, telling Clari&s;&s;a that they would all go together, and that &s;he would leave her woman to &s;et her apartment in order. All her objections were over ruled: &s;he was led to the coach, and Lady Betty ordered Mrs. Moore to get &s;upper ready again&s;t their re|turn. All the way nothing pa&s;&s;ed but the height of affectionate complai&s;ance. But what dreadful terrors &s;eized Clari&s;&s;a's mind, when &s;he came within &s;ight of the odious hou&s;e from which &s;he had made her e&s;cape! The coach &s;topped at the door, and Clari&s;&s;a cried out;&mdash;but Lovelace, begging &s;he would be under no apprehen&s;ions, a&s;ked if there were any letters for him. Dreadfully did Clari&s;&s;a's heart mi&s;give her; &s;he was ready to faint. O my life, &s;aid Lovelace, why this terror? You &s;hall not &s;tir out of the coach.

walked out of the hou&s;e without being ob|&s;erved. No &s;ooner was &s;he gone than the whole hou&s;e was in confu&s;ion; but all en|deavours to find her were in vain. She had taken lodgings at Mr. Smith's, a glover, in King-&s;treet, Covent-garden, where &s;he had two rooms on the fir&s;t floor; and, while &s;he was prai&s;ing God for her happy e&s;cape, Lovelace was raving, cur&s;ing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ending orders to &s;earch for her in all the villages round London.</P>
<P>Clari&s;&s;a in&s;tantly wrote to inform Mi&s;s Howe of the lo&s;s of her honour, and her e&s;cape; and al&s;o to Lady Betty Lawrence and Mi&s;s Montague, to know whether they were at Hamp&s;tead, and had brought her in a coach and four to town.

The letter &s;he had &s;ent to Mi&s;s Howe fell into the hands of that young lady's mother, who returned a very &s;evere an&s;wer, which the &s;till unhappy Clari&s;&s;a received, while her mind was &s;inking under the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing tho'ts of the cruelty of relations, whom &s;he had nev|er cea&s;ed to love, and the dreadful idea of her father's cur&s;e; but this giving a turn to her thoughts, helped to remove her de&s;pond|ency. At la&s;t &s;he received a letter from Mi&s;s Howe; but it was only &s;uch a one as aggravated her di&s;tre&s;s, and made her think &s;he had lo&s;t her only friend. That lady re|flected on her for voluntarily returning to the wicked Sinclair's, after her informing her in two letters of the infamous character of the hou&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that Captain Tomlin&s;on was an impo&s;tor: mentioned her receiving the la&s;t in a disordered manner, lying on a couch, with her face red and bloated; and told her that &s;he had &s;ent a per&s;on, who went to Mrs. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with a &s;trong guard to take her in|to her protection.</P>
<P>Grieved and &s;urpri&s;ed at the contents of this letter, Clari&s;&s;a, in her reply, vindicated her own conduct from the charge of impru|dence, &s;ending back the long letter forged by Lovelace&punc; and then writing to Hamp|&s;tead, was informed that Mrs. Bevis, by Lovelace's de&s;ire, had per&s;onated her, in

Her re&s;entment was now levelled again&s;t Lovelace alone; and both her mother and &s;he joined in per|&s;uading Clari&s;&s;a to pro&s;ecute that abandon|ed villain; but all their arguments had no effect.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lady Betty Law|rence, and Mi&s;s Montague went to Lord M&mdash;'s, and in that nobleman's pre&s;ence read to Lovelace the letters they had receiv|ed from the injured Clari&s;&s;a, and in very &s;e|vere terms reproached him for his villainy.

Accordingly Mi&s;s Mon|tague and Lady Sad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ir, her &s;i&s;ter, went in Lord M&mdash;'s coach and &s;ix, to pay Mi&s;s Howe a vi&s;it, to entreat her to engage her

<P>Mi&s;s Howe, influenced by their rea&s;ons, pre&s;&s;ed her dear friend to marry him, as the only means of procuring her own happine&s;s. This letter &s;he &s;ent by the po&s;t, de&s;iring an immediate an&s;wer; but receiving none, &s;he wrote again to chide her for keeping her in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and &s;ent the letter by a me&s;&s;enger, who travelled all night, and carried it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Mr. Smith's; where he was told that &s;he had been mi&s;&s;ing &s;everal days; for, going about &s;ix in the morning to prayers at Cov|ent-Garden church, very poorly in health, they had not heard of her &s;ince.

<P>This gentleman, who had often been an advocate for Clari&s;&s;a, and had frequently en|deavoured to per&s;uade him to do her ju&s;tice, in&s;tantly ha&s;ted to the vile Sinclair's, and not finding the lady there, po&s;ted to the officers, but, as it was Sunday, could not obtain the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of her, &s;he being re&s;olv|ed to have the remainder of the day to her|&s;elf. However, the next morning, he was introduced into the room by the officer's wife, when he was immediately &s;hocked at the dreadful place in which he found her, and its wretched furniture. She was kneel|ing in a corner, near a di&s;mal broken win|dow, &s;ecured with iron bars, her arms cro&s;&s;ed upon a crazy table, and the fore finger of

her right hand in a Bible. Her dre&s;s was a neat white dama&s;k; her head-cloaths were a little di&s;compo&s;ed; her fine hair hanging in natural ringlets, but a little tangled, &s;had|ed one &s;ide of her neck, as her rumpled handkerchief did the other; and her face, yet lovely, amid&s;t all her &s;ufferings, re&s;ted on her arms.</P>
<P>While Mr. Belford took a view of the room, and the kneeling lady in her white flowing dre&s;s, he thought his concern would have choaked him; and &s;tammering out a cur&s;e at the officer and his wife, a&s;ked if that was an apartment for &s;uch a lady? They replied, in excu&s;e, that they had offered her their own bed-chamber, but &s;he refu&s;ed it. The charming &s;ufferer then rai&s;ing her love|ly face, over&s;pread with the mo&s;t &s;ignificant woe, waved her hand towards the door, as if de&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing him to withdraw: he begged &s;he would do him the favour to hear him for one moment, but this &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed.

Then turning to the officer, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he was better reconciled to his hou&s;e than at fir&s;t, and if he could but engage that none but his wife &s;hould come near her, &s;he &s;hould die with him, and they &s;hould be well &s;atisfied for their trouble; and then turning to Mr. Belford, again en|treated him to leave her, repeating, &s;he would owe no obligation to the friend of her de&s;troyer; but offering to ri&s;e, &s;he, through weakne&s;s, &s;unk down and fainted away.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford and the officer retiring, left her to the care of the woman of the hou&s;e and her maid; and after her recovery, be|ing informed &s;he was &s;o weak and low that &s;he could hardly &s;peak, Mr. Belford took

<P>On his return, an apothecary who had been &s;ent for, had ju&s;t gone up &s;tairs; and the officer's wife being above with him, Mr. Belford made no &s;cruple of following them.

That Mr. Smith and his wife had been ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of apprehen&s;ions for her &s;afety, and that he had brought two letters, which had been left there for her.

He again en|treated her to think of quitting that wretched place, a&s;&s;uring her, in the &s;olemne&s;t manner,
<PB N="103" REF="029413_0105_0FE0F288E2610298">
that nobody &s;hould di&s;turb her at Mr. Smith's; and that he would particularly en|gage his honour, that he who had mo&s;t of|fended her, &s;hould not come near her with|out her own con&s;ent. Your honour, Sir! &s;aid &s;he, are you not that man's friend? I am not a friend, Madam, returned he, to his vile actions to the mo&s;t excellent of women. Do you flatter me, Sir? &s;aid &s;he. O Sir, your friend, your barbarous friend, what has he to an&s;wer for! Her heart was too full to proceed; and putting her hand over her eyes, he &s;aw the tears trickle through her fingers.

<P>Mr. Belford then left the room, and took that opportunity to make a &s;mall pre&s;ent to the officer and his maid; and &s;ending for the apothecary, he paid him beyond his expecta|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ions.

would even yet be a welcome &s;urpri&s;e. But if he comes, what &s;hall I do about that &s;creen? He will probably chide me, and I can't bear chiding now.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford now favoured Mr. Morden's retreat, and the &s;creen was placed as near the window as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent his &s;eeing what was behind it; while he, hearing all &s;he &s;aid, re&s;olved to take no notice of it. He &s;oon after &s;ent in his name, and being in&s;tantly admitted, folded the lady in his arms as &s;he &s;at, dropping down on one knee; for placing her hands on the elbows of the chair, &s;he attempted to ri&s;e, but could not. Excu&s;e me, my dear cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, excu&s;e my not &s;tanding up. I did not ex|pect &s;uch a favour now; but I am glad of this opportunity of thanking you for all your kind and generous goodne&s;s. I never, my be&s;t beloved and deare&s;t cou&s;in, &s;aid he, the tears gu&s;hing from his eyes, &s;hall forgive my&s;elf that I did not attend you &s;ooner.

If they did&mdash;If they did, repeated &s;he, interrupting him, I &s;hould have more compa&s;&s;ion for them&mdash;I am &s;ure I &s;hould. But pray, Sir, how did you leave them? Are you recon|ciled to them? If you are not, I beg, if you love your poor Clari&s;&s;a, that you will; for

every widened difference &s;erves to augment my fault, &s;ince that is the foundation of all. He then told her, that he had brought her the accounts of her grandfather's e&s;tate, with bills and draughts upon their banker&punc; le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be in want of money; and that this was &s;uch an earne&s;t of an approaching reconciliation, that he dared to an&s;wer for every thing el&s;e.

I never had any pride in being independent: all my actions, when I might have made my&s;elf more &s;o, &s;hew this. She then apologized for having troubled Mr. Bel|ford with the office of being her executor, from her not having &s;een him &s;ooner, and not knowing that he &s;till honoured her with his regard; and entreated him not to re|venge her on Lovelace. After this, com|plaining of her being very faint and low, and expre&s;&s;ing her &s;orrow that &s;he could not bet|ter de&s;erve the honour of that vi&s;it, &s;he &s;unk back into her chair, and was &s;ilent; on which the colonel and Mr. Belford in&s;tantly withdrew.</P>

but her &s;oul ardently a&s;piring after im|mortality, &s;he imagined the time moved &s;lowly; and with great pre&s;ence of mind, &s;he gave orders in relation to her body, di|recting her nur&s;e and the maid of the hou&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he was cold, to put her into her coffin. The colonel, after paying her an|other vi&s;it, wrote to her uncle Mr. John Harlowe, that they might &s;ave them&s;elves the trouble of having any farther debates about reconciliation; for before they could re&s;olve, his dear cou&s;in would probably be no more.</P>
<P>A day or two after, Mr. Belford was &s;ent for, and immediately came: at his entrance he &s;aw the colonel kneeling by her bed-&s;ide with the lady's right hand in both his, which his face covered, bathing it with his tears, though &s;he had ju&s;t been endeavouring to comfort him, in noble and elevated &s;trains. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the bed was &s;eated Mrs. Lovick, who leaning again&s;t the bed's head in a mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate manner, turned to him, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw him, crying, O Mr. Belford, the dear lady!&mdash;a heavy &s;igh not permitting her to &s;ay more. Mrs. Smith was kneeling at the bed's feet, with cla&s;ped fingers and uplifted eyes, with the tears trickling in large drops down her cheeks, as if imploring help from the Source of life and every comfort.</P>

The excellent lady had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent a few minutes, and was thought &s;peechle&s;s, &s;he moving her lips without uttering a word; but when Mrs. Lovick, on Mr. Belford's approach, pronounced his name, O Mr. Bel|ford! cried &s;he, in a faint inward voice, Now!&mdash;now!&mdash;I ble&s;s God, all will &s;oon be over&mdash;a few&mdash;a very few moments will end this &s;trife&mdash;and I &s;hall be happy!&mdash;Comfort, Sir,&mdash;comfort, my cou&s;in&mdash;See!&mdash;the blameable kindne&s;s!&mdash;He does not wi&s;h me to be happy &s;o &s;oon!&mdash;Then pau&s;ing for two or three minutes, during which her looks were earne&s;tly fixed on the colonel, My deare&s;t cou&s;in, &s;he re&s;umed, be comforted!&mdash;What is dying but the com|mon lot?&mdash;The mortal frame may &s;eem to labour&mdash;but that is all: it is not &s;o hard to die as I thought&mdash;The prepara|tion is the difficulty, and I ble&s;s God I have had time for that!&mdash;the re&s;t is wor&s;e to beholders than to me!&mdash;I am all ble&s;&s;ed hope&mdash;hope it&s;elf!

<P>She was again &s;ilent for a few moments, lifting up her eyes, and the hand her cou&s;in did not hold between his, and then cried, "O death! where is thy &s;ting?"&mdash;"It is good for me that I was afflicted." Then turning to the colonel and Mr. Belford, who were lo&s;t in &s;peechle&s;s &s;orrow, O dear, dear gentlemen, &s;aid &s;he, you don't know what foreta&s;tes&mdash;what a&s;&s;urances&mdash;Here &s;he again &s;topped, and looked upward, &s;weetly &s;miling, as if in a thankful rapture.</P>
<P>She then turned her head towards Mr. Belford, and &s;aid, Do you, Sir, tell your friend, that I forgive him! And I pray God forgive him! again pau&s;ing, and lifting up her eyes, as if praying for his forgivene&s;s. Let him know, added &s;he, how happily I die, and that I wi&s;h his la&s;t hour may be like mine.</P>
<P>Again &s;he was &s;ilent for a few moments, and then re&s;uming&mdash;My &s;ight fails me!&mdash;your voices only&mdash;but the voice of grief is alike in all.

<P>After again continuing for a &s;hort time &s;ilent, &s;he re&s;umed, in a more faint and broken accent, And you, Mr. Belford, pre&s;|&s;ing his hand, may God pre&s;erve you, and make you &s;en&s;ible of all your errors!&mdash;may you be&mdash;She then &s;unk her head upon her pillow, and fainting away, drew from them her hands.

<P>Mr. Belford and the colonel pre&s;&s;ed her &s;till warm though lifele&s;s hand with their lips, and then retired into the next room, where they looked at each other as if going to &s;peak; but, as if one motion governed, as one cau&s;e affected both, they turned away &s;ilent. Mr. Morden &s;ighed as if his heart would bur&s;t; and at la&s;t, lifting up his hands and face, Good Heaven! &s;aid he, &s;upport me!

<P>The very day after Clari&s;&s;a's death, a &s;er|vant in livery brought for her a letter from her brother, and another from her &s;i&s;ter, to comfort and a&s;&s;ure her of her father's and mother's ble&s;&s;ing, which &s;he had &s;o ardently longed for, and which, had they come in time, &s;he would have received with great joy.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford, on looking over her papers, found &s;he had written letters to be &s;ent after her decea&s;e, to every one of her family; al&s;o to Mi&s;s Howe and Lovelace; and one to him&s;elf. The&s;e were all written in a tender, pious, and generous &s;train, in order to give comfort, rather than di&s;tre&s;s; her duty, af|fection, and piety, appeared in every line; and all of them expre&s;&s;ed the ec&s;tatic a&s;&s;u|rance, that when tho&s;e letters came to their hands, &s;he &s;hould be enjoying eternal felicity.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford, now in the character of her executor, &s;ent one of his &s;ervants with the po&s;thumous letters to the family, and to Mi&s;s Howe, and al&s;o a letter from Colonel.

found the whole family a&s;&s;embled, on occa&s;ion of the letter the Colonel had before &s;ent, and flattering them&s;elves with the hopes, that to ha&s;ten their re&s;olutions, their cou&s;in had repre&s;ented her wor&s;e than &s;he really was; but the &s;ervant had no &s;ooner deliver|ed the letter that contained the fatal news, than the whole hou&s;e was in the utmo&s;t con|fu&s;ion, the &s;ervants running different ways, lamenting and wringing their hands; Mrs. Harlowe was in fits, and all in &s;uch di&s;order, that he could get no commands, nor obtain any notice of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He therefore proceeded to Mrs. Howe's, where he had the precaution to de&s;ire to &s;peak with Mi&s;s's maid, to whom he com|municated the fatal news, that &s;he might break it to her mi&s;tre&s;s. The maid her&s;elf was &s;o affected, that the old lady came to &s;ee what ailed her, and was her&s;elf &s;o &s;truck with the communication, that &s;he was oblig|ed to &s;it down. O the &s;weet creature! &s;aid &s;he, And is it come to this?&mdash;O my poor Nancy&mdash;How &s;hall I be able to break the matter to my Nancy! When Mrs. Howe was a little recovered, &s;he went up, in order to let her daughter know the dreadful tid|ings, taking the letter and &s;alts in her hand. In&s;tantly the hou&s;e-keeper, with her face over&s;pread with tears, came hurrying down
<PB N="129" REF="029413_0131_0FE0F2CF6DEE2DC0">
into the kitchen, crying, her young mi&s;tre&s;s had fainted away; nor did &s;he wonder at it&mdash;There never lived a lady more wor|thy of general admiration than Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe! and never was their a &s;tronger friend&s;hip di&s;&s;olved by death, than between her young lady and her. She then hurried away with a lighted wax candle, and feathers to burn under the no&s;e of her young mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Morden re&s;olved to accompany the hear&s;e to Harlowe-Place. The coffin was filled with flowers and aromatic herbs; and proper care taken to prevent the corp&s;e from being moved by the jolting of the hear&s;e. He arrived at Harlowe-Place, &s;ome time before the body. At his entrance into the court, all were in motion, every &s;ervant he &s;aw had &s;welled eyes, and &s;eemed deeply concerned. But a perfect concert of grief broke out the moment they &s;aw him enter the parlour. Mr. Harlowe, the father, no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes upon him, than he cried, O cou&s;in, cou&s;in, you are the only per&s;on of all our family, who have nothing to reproach your&s;elf with! The poor mother, bowing her head to him, in &s;peechle&s;s grief, &s;at with her handkerchief held to her eyes with one hand, while her &s;i&s;ter Harvey held the other between both hers, weeping upon it. Mr.

Anthony Harlowe, who conducted Colonel Morden into the room, went towards Mrs. Harlowe, crying, Don't&mdash;don't&mdash;dear &s;i&s;ter! then towards the afflicted father, Don't&mdash;don't, dear brother, don't thus give way&mdash;and without being able to &s;ay an|other word, went to a corner of the room, and, wanting him&s;elf the comfort he &s;trove to give, &s;unk into a chair, and &s;obbed aloud.</P>
<P>The colonel then approaching the incon|&s;olable mother, &s;aid, Let us not, Madam, give way to a grief, which however ju&s;t, can be of no avail. We hurt our&s;elves, and can|not recal the dear creature for whom we mourn. Nor indeed would you wi&s;h it, did you but know with what a&s;&s;urances of eter|nal happine&s;s &s;he left the world. She is happy, Madam!&mdash;depend upon it, &s;he is happy! and let this be your comfort. O cou&s;in, cou&s;in! cried the unhappy mother, withdrawing her hand from her &s;i&s;ter Har|vey's and pre&s;&s;ing the colonel's with it. You know not what a child I have lo&s;t!&mdash;and how lo&s;t! That it is that makes my lo&s;s in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>They now all joined in the melancholy chorus, each accu&s;ing him and her&s;elf, and &s;ome one another. But the eyes of all were in turn fixed upon James Harlowe, as the per&s;on who had kept up the general re&s;ent|ment,
<PB N="131" REF="029413_0133_0FE0F2D501806640">
while he &s;eemed hardly able to bear his own remor&s;e, nor Mi&s;s Harlowe hers, &s;he breaking out, How tauntingly did I write to her! How barbarou&s;ly did I in&s;ult her! Yet how patiently did &s;he bear it! O brother, brother!&mdash;but for you!&mdash;but for you!&mdash;Double not upon me, cried he, in|terrupting her, my own woes! I only tho't to reclaim a dear creature that had erred! I did not intend to break her heart! but it was the villainous Lovelace who did that&mdash;not any of us! We mu&s;t forever lament, cried the unhappy mother, our unkindne&s;s to &s;o &s;weet a child!&mdash;Indeed, indeed, added &s;he &s;oftly to her &s;i&s;ter Harvey, I have been too pa&s;&s;ive, much too pa&s;&s;ive. The tempo|rary quiet I have, all my life, been &s;o &s;tudi|ous to pre&s;erve, will co&s;t me everla&s;ting di&s;|quiet!&mdash;Dear &s;i&s;ter! was all the an&s;wer Mrs. Harvey could make.&mdash;I have done but half my duty to the deare&s;t and mo&s;t de|&s;erving of my children, re&s;umed the afflicted mother;&mdash;nay, not half&mdash;How have we hardened our hearts again&s;t her! Again her tears choaked up the pa&s;&s;age of her words, and, Deare&s;t, deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter! was all the reply Mrs. Harvey could make. Would to heaven, proceeded the mother, I had but once &s;een her! Then lifting up her eyes to her &s;on and daughter, &s;he added, O James!

O Arabella! were we to receive as little mercy!</P>
<P>The hear&s;e at length came to the gate, and a &s;ervant entered to let them know what its lumbering heavy noi&s;e up the paved inner|court-yard had before apprized them of; unable to &s;peak, he looked, bowed, and withdrew. Clari&s;&s;a, having been univer&s;ally beloved, on account of her being the com|mon patrone&s;s of all the hone&s;t poor in the neighbourhood, about fifty men, women, and children, had, at the &s;olemn tolling of the bell of the pari&s;h church, a&s;&s;embled; this was a re&s;pect paid to the memory of the de|cea&s;ed, out of officious love, as the hear&s;e pa&s;&s;ed near the church. Several of the&s;e people made a good appearance, but not one of them had a dry eye, each lamenting the death of the admirable lady, who never &s;tir|red out but &s;omebody was the better for it. When the coffin was taken out of the hear&s;e, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e crowding about it, for a few moments, hindered its being carried in, the young people &s;triving who &s;hould bear it. At length, &s;ix maidens were permitted to carry it by the &s;ix handles, into a parlour adjoin|ing to the hall, which Clari&s;&s;a u&s;ed to call her parlour, and placed it on a table in the middle of the room; but when the father and mother, her aunt Harvey, the two uncles,

and her &s;i&s;ter came in, joining her brother and Mr. Morden, the &s;cene became &s;till more affecting. Their &s;orrow was, doubt|le&s;s, heightened by the idea of their cruelty; and now &s;eeing before them the receptacle that contained the glory of their family, who was &s;o lately driven thence by their indi&s;creet and cruel violence, no wonder their grief was more than they knew how to bear. They would have with-held the mother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> entering the parlour; but when they could not, though undetermined before, led by an irre&s;i&s;table impul&s;e, they all bore her company. The poor lady did but ju&s;t ca&s;t her eye upon the coffin, and then &s;natching it away, re|tired with pa&s;&s;ionate grief towards the win|dow, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to her beloved daugh|ter, O my child! my child! cried &s;he, thou pride of my hope! why, oh why was not I permitted to &s;peak pardon and peace to thee? O forgive thy cruel mother! The father's grief was too deep for utterance, till he &s;aw his &s;on coming in, when giving a groan, Never, &s;aid he, was &s;orrow like mine! O &s;on, &s;on! added he in a reproaching ac|cent. Her uncles and her &s;i&s;ter frequently looked and turned away on the emblems, in &s;ilent &s;orrow. Mrs. Harvey would have read to them the in&s;cription: the&s;e words &s;he did read: "Here the wicked cea&s;e

<P>The&s;e mourners were no &s;ooner retired, than Mr. Morden ordered the lid of the cof|fin to be un&s;crewed, and cau&s;ed &s;ome fre&s;h aromatics and flowers to be put into it.
