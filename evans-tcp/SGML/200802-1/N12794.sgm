<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS this little peice may be read by &s;ome, who know not the Author, nor his &s;ituation at Lebanon, it may be needful to &s;ay a few things re&s;pecting both.</P>
<P>I had been regularly called to preach in this Society as a Candidate for &s;ettlement, in the place of my late venerable Grand-Father. After &s;ome time the Society by a majority of a little more than two thirds, invited me to &s;ettle with them as their Pa&s;tor, in which the Church almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly concurred. On con&s;ideration whereof, together with the earne&s;t De&s;ire of my kind Friends, and my affection for them and the people, and by the advice of other wi&s;e and judicious Per&s;ons, I tho't it my duty to except the call of &s;o great a Majority. Some further time being elap&s;ed, and the good people who were a|gain&s;t my Settlement, continuing to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to it, (which in the opinion of many was not to have been expected; the a&s;pect of publick affairs being difficult, and having a mind di&s;po&s;ed for perfect peace and harmony;) I wi&s;hed to be relea&s;|ed from my obligations, hoping the Society would be better united in &s;ome better man, and accordingly reque&s;ted it of them. But &s;uch was the unmerited attachment of my worthy and dear Friends, that they could not be per&s;uaded to con&s;ent. Af|terwards a Council of Rev. Mini&s;ters was at my reque&s;t agreed upon and called to advi&s;e all the concerned; who were kind enough to attend and con&s;ider the matter, and agreed upon the re&s;ult which is &s;ubjoined.</P>
<P>Being about to leave the Society in con&s;equence of their ad|vice, the following Sermon was delivered. It was compo&s;ed under more than u&s;ual di&s;advantages, while I was not ma&s;ter of my own (&s;hort) time, and without the lea&s;t thought of its ever being printed. But unexpectedly, repeated applications have been made to me for a Copy; I have con&s;ented; not with the lea&s;t wi&s;h of commencing Author, or being known to the
<PB N="4" REF="016172_0003_0F9BC9B4D153F190" MS="y">
learned world, but to gratify my worthy Friends, who it &s;eems wi&s;hed for &s;ome vi&s;ible token of their kind remembrance, and to convince me that to the la&s;t their affection continued with unabated &s;trength. And &s;hould it contribute to the &s;o|lid comfort or final Salvation of one Soul, how great would be my reward? The critick may if he plea&s;e make many ob|&s;ervations on the inaccuracy of the compo&s;ition, the har&s;hne&s;s or flatne&s;s of the Periods &amp;c. But let it be remembered that in|&s;truction is a much greater object, than mere entertainment; and that the beauties of Style have no peculiar reli&s;h, nor do they form any e&s;&s;ential, or even needful part in the Chri&s;tian Character. It is not the elegance and purity of religious compo&s;ition, which in&s;tructs and refre&s;hes good people, but the plainne&s;s and importance of the truths that are held up to view. The truths of the Bible are the &s;weete&s;t Food of religious contemplative minds. If we would be u&s;eful we &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in as &s;imple and familiar a manner as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;Religious a&s;|&s;emblies meet to pray and prai&s;e, to under&s;tand the Bible and the ble&s;&s;ed Truths of the Go&s;pel, and not Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">omes, Rol|lin's, Belles Letters or L<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">wth's Grammer. Had I affected it, tis po&s;&s;ible I might have dre&s;&s;ed the di&s;cour&s;e in a politer Garb, but an eligant Style or hand&s;ome peice of compo&s;ition will carry no body to Heaven, nor qualify for it. Let none collect hence that I wi&s;h to di&s;courage the &s;tudy of language and compo&s;ition, far from it. But would only in&s;inuate that a love for accuracy with &s;ome, almo&s;t &s;wallows up objects of un&s;peakably greater moment. It is al&s;o, one thing to gaze at a Preacher, admire and be carried away with the &s;ound and &s;weetne&s;s of his Voice, the ingenuity of his remarks, and &s;moothne&s;s of his periods, and a very different one, by a &s;eri|ous attention, with a mixture of Faith, to endeavour to get profit by the word preached, and to be led into the knowledge and practice of Soul intere&s;ting Truths. To know Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified, the &s;overeign Phy&s;ician of &s;in &s;ick

<P>The <HI>26</HI>th was ob&s;erved as a day of &s;olemn humiliation and prayer, in order to &s;eek divine direction, and publickly attend|ed by the Council, the Church and Society. The next day the Council proceeded to a full hearing of all matters relative to the difficulties afore&s;aid; as laid before them by the Church and Society Committee and the aggreived Brethren; and found the oppo&s;ition to the &s;ettlement of Mr. Williams &s;o great, and attended with &s;o many unfavourable pro&s;pects of u&s;efulne&s;s and comfort, as to render it, in our opinion inexpe|dient. Therefore on mature deliberation, the Council unani|mou&s;ly advi&s;e the Church and Society to acquie&s;ce in the re|que&s;t of Mr. Williams, to be relea&s;ed from his obligations to them by an acceptance of their call, &s;ignified in his memorial laid before them in Society Meeting September <HI>22</HI>d, <HI>1777.</HI> We rejoice that Mr. Williams's moral and religious Charac|ter

<P>I think it is an ob&s;ervation that will hold throughout, that Chri&s;t ever u&s;ed the ea&s;ie&s;t and happie&s;t methods to in&s;truct his hearers. He &s;carcely failed of opening and illu&s;trating the mo&s;t important truths by things drawn from common life, and within every ones reach and ac|quaintance. He did not need to be let into our &s;lowne&s;s of under&s;tanding, into our mi&s;apprehen&s;ions and prejudi|ces, into our &s;piritual blindne&s;s and darkne&s;s, He, there|fore, knew the need of the plaine&s;t preaching. He knew that what was not under&s;tood, could not be rationally loved nor practi&s;ed.&mdash;He came to in&s;truct the ignorant, to enlighten the blind, to guide the doubting, and &s;trengthen the weak. With this great de&s;ign ever full in his view, he accommodated him&s;elf, in his private conver&s;ation and public preaching, to the circum&s;tances and capacities of all&mdash;He adapted him&s;elf to the weake&s;t and meane&s;t mind. He &s;poke for God to man. He &s;poke to dying and immortal creatures. He &s;poke from the mo&s;t benevolent heart&mdash;Chri&s;t was a poor weak man's preacher&mdash;He that was to teach mankind mu&s;t u&s;e a plain familiar method; or he would never &s;ucceed. A &s;chool ma&s;ter, for &s;uch was Chri&s;t, and &s;uch were his Apo&s;tles, begins with the ea&s;ie&s;t le&s;&s;ons, and talk in &s;uch a &s;train, as that the tender pupil takes it in by little and little, and gradually goes forward, when under proper

care, adding one improvement to another: Beginning, (in the metaphorical language of the bible,) with milk, and ending in &s;trong meat &s;uited to a robu&s;t con&s;titution: &s;uited, (to drop the Metaphor,) to an enlarged well grown capacity. A public teacher, as Chri&s;t was, &s;hould al|ways endeavour to get, while he avoids vulgari&s;m's, the plaine&s;t &s;tyle, the mo&s;t obvious and &s;triking thoughts, and the &s;imple&s;t connection between his ideas. He &s;hould open it with &s;uch ea&s;e, that all may &s;ee it; and apply it in &s;uch a manner, if po&s;&s;ible, that all may feel it and pro|fit by it&mdash;It &s;hould run in as clear, as con&s;tant and copi|ous a &s;tream as may be&mdash;His own heart &s;hould ever burn with a love for it: his life &s;hould exemplify it; and warm from his heart, it &s;hould run thro' all his &s;ermons.&mdash;</P>
<P>Not only did Chri&s;t u&s;e a familiar intelligible method in opening truth, but he dwelt upon the greate&s;t truths.&mdash;</P>
<P>The fundamental articles of our faith and practice were the burden, the &s;ub&s;tance, the ground work of his preaching. Unprofitable nicities, trifling que&s;tions, learned pompous harangue made no part of his public teaching&mdash;In this, he is an excellent pattern&mdash;Nor is this all&mdash;His method was clo&s;e and pungent&mdash;Truth was in|finitely dear to him&mdash;He was the truth&mdash;Truth it&s;elf o|riginal, e&s;&s;ential eternal truth&mdash;His &s;ermons are filled with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting truths&mdash;He told all, as he judg|ed be&s;t, when opportunity offered, their true character and &s;ituation&mdash;He was not a courtier nor a fawning flat|terer&mdash;He did not &s;eek applau&s;e and honor from crea|tures&mdash;He could never be prevailed upon to feed our va|nity, gratify a carnal heart, and build our hopes upon a fal&s;e foundation&mdash;We are ever directed to the Rock of ages for comfort and &s;upport&mdash;Every carnal confidence and creature tru&s;t is a bed &s;horter than that a man can &s;tretch him&s;elf on it, and a covering too narrow to wrap him&s;elf in it&mdash;Chri&s;t is a &s;ure foundation&mdash;I&s;a&mdash;28&mdash;He

That preaching, the leading ob|ject and &s;ole tendency of which, is evidently, to get a name, to gratify curio&s;ity, to lull people a &s;leep when dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, and feed their native pride, will do ten thou&s;and times the mi&s;chief, that it doth good.

The 9<HI>th ver.</HI> informs us of the call and conver&s;ion of <HI>Matthew</HI>; who was a <HI>publican,</HI> or a collector of taxes. This bu&s;ine&s;s opened a door for cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice&mdash;And the temptation, likely, proved too &s;trong for the mo&s;t. We find that this &s;ort of officers was ge|nerally hated and di&s;pi&s;ed. This <HI>Matthew</HI> was however, where he &s;hould be; <HI>&s;itting at the receit of cu&s;tom.</HI> It is always be&s;t to be where Providence calls us&mdash;where our proper bu&s;ine&s;s lies. Idlene&s;s expo&s;es to almo&s;t every &s;in. But tho' this was his bu&s;ine&s;s, yet that was no in&s;upera|ble bar in the way of his &s;alvation. Chri&s;t calls him, and he comes&mdash;Almighty power accompanied the call. As in creation, &s;o here. <HI>He &s;peaks, and it is done.</HI> When grace took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart, he bid farewell to his po&s;t with all its profits. The charmes were gone. Oh how &s;mall an object will grace make this world appear! How trifling its offer&mdash;How empty its plea&s;ures&mdash;How vain its honors&mdash;How &s;hort lived its riches&mdash;when com|pared with the &s;atisfying, &s;olid and permanent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eternity!&mdash;</P>

Per&s;ons cloathed with &s;uch authority and dignity, did not often attend him but to blacken his character, di&s;credit his preaching, and ruin his influence as a public teacher. <HI>Rulers and phylo&s;ophers</HI> were di&s;gu&s;ted with the plaine&s;s, the &s;implicity and holine&s;s of his religion&mdash;<HI>Publicans and &s;inners</HI> were round him&mdash;His name was <HI>Je&s;us&mdash;He came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t</HI>&mdash;Offence is at once given to the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> the mo&s;t notable <HI>Jewi&s;h &s;ect&mdash;And when the Phari&s;ees &s;aw it, they &s;aid unto his di&s;ciples, Why eat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t your ma&s;ter with publicans and &s;inners?</HI> They would not follow him, becau&s;e he paid not the lea&s;t regard to their great abilities, their fancied importanc, their pomp|ous profe&s;&s;ions, and vi&s;ible &s;trictne&s;s and devotion&mdash;He was continually holding them up to public view as de|&s;igning hypocritical per&s;ons. He expo&s;ed the badne&s;s of their real characters, the emptine&s;s of their profe&s;&s;ions, the carnality of their views, and the &s;ecret wickedne&s;s of their life.

Who can bear to have their in&s;ide character, their retired &s;entiments and hidden ba&s;ene&s;s ex|po&s;ed to the view and dete&s;tation of every one?

There is, in the que&s;tion, a &s;eeming tenderne&s;s for Chri&s;t's charac|ter&mdash;But it covered the wickedne&s;s of their hearts&mdash; Chri&s;t heared it, and prevents an an&s;wer from his di&s;ciples: who might be unable to make a &s;uitable reply and wipe off the reproach that was thrown upon their Ma&s;ter.

<P>As tho' he had &s;aid.
<Q>Why do you quarrel with me on this account. You &s;ee what I am ever upon. I am always doing good either to the &s;ouls or bodies of men, or to both. My works on every &s;ide &s;peak forth the goodne&s;s of my heart&mdash;But be&s;ides, you do not love my company. You will not hearken to my in&s;tructions. You re&s;i&s;t the evidence of my miracles. You have op|po&s;ed me from the beginning. You &s;till retain the &s;ame temper. You do not rejoice at my coming into the world upon the mo&s;t benevolent de&s;ign, nor do you welcome me into your hou&s;es. And the rea&s;on is plain. You are they that ju&s;tify your&s;elves. You &s;ee no need of a Saviour. You think that you are good enough. You have no guilt to be removed. No na|ture to be wa&s;hed in my blood. Your apprehen&s;ions of religious &s;ubjects are &s;piritual. Your will is pliable. Your affections are under the happy government of rea&s;on and religion. All within is as it ought to be. This is your opinion of your&s;elves. No wonder then, that you do not look el&s;ewhere, to me, and to heaven for help. Pray why &s;hould you, when your own &s;trength, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s an&s;wers all nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es? The man that enjoys good health, and la|bors under no real nor imaginary indi&s;po&s;ition will not apply to a doctor, phy&s;ic him&s;elf, and keep his bed. And if he knows that he feels very well, finds him&s;elf

&s;trong, able to travel, labor or do what he plea&s;es, it will be a difficult matter to per&s;uade or rea&s;on him in|to a fit of &s;ickne&s;s: To bring him to believe that the <HI>drop&s;y,</HI> or <HI>pluricy,</HI> or the <HI>gout</HI> is fixed on him. To &s;pi|rituali&s;e the &s;imilitude, it is &s;o with you.</Q>
In what a familiar, &s;triking, and, one would think, unexceptionable manner, is an important truth opened and illu&s;trated? It was a full an&s;wer to their objections and cavils.

We ob&s;erve in the 1&s;t place. That &s;uch &s;inners condemn them&s;elves for all their &s;ins. They &s;ee that the divine character, which they have hated, is incomparably glori|ous.

They &s;ee that months, and years, in one word, their pa&s;t life, is little el&s;e or more than a blank in their exi&s;tence: that they have abu&s;ed their mercies, mi&s;improved their privileges, trifled with concerns of e|ternal moment, and lo&s;t many precious coun&s;els, warnings and reproofs. They &s;ee that ingratitude, di&s;affection, rebellion, &s;tupidity, and madne&s;s, are written and en|&s;tamped upon their heart and life. Let them look where they will, it is bad.

It is all condemned. Heart and life are &s;entenced and condemned. The more there is that opens to view: the more &s;uch a &s;inner knows of him&s;elf, the more particular will this condem|nation be. The &s;ooner a thing is traced to the &s;ource, the &s;ooner will it be adjudged and condemned. For if the fountain be corrupt, &s;o will the &s;treams be. If the heart be bad, the life can't be good. The one is but the expre&s;&s;ion, the opening, the letting out of the other. The action wholly &s;eparate from the heart is nothing. No more virtuous nor vicious than the motion of a clock, the blowing of the wind, or the rollings of the &s;ea. The &s;in &s;ick &s;inner condemns vain thoughts, carnal de|&s;ires, retired lu&s;ts, as well as an immoral life. He con|demns all that he did, without any love for God, and holy delight in duty. He views all that he has done as trifling, as empty &s;hew, but the form of godline&s;s with|out any of the power, the &s;pirit and beauty of it. He was all the time, when he had worked him&s;elf to the highe&s;t pitch of goodne&s;s, dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, a child of di&s;obedience, and an heir of wrath. He con|demns

No other &s;ee any need of Chri&s;t. Why then &s;hould they go to Chri&s;t? who came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repent|ance. Why &s;hould, healthy &s;ound people apply to a phy&s;ician for help, for phy&s;ic and a cure? They need no help, no medicines, no cure. One might enlarge. Tho' words can &s;carcely make it plainer.</P>
<P N="3">III. We pa&s;s in the 3d place&mdash;Briefly to de&s;cribe Chri&s;t under the character of <HI>the phy&s;ician</HI> of &s;in &s;ick &s;inners&mdash; the <HI>phy&s;ician</HI> of &s;ouls&mdash;</P>
<P>He is called by the prophet&mdash;<HI>The balm of Gilead.</HI> Jer. 8&mdash;<HI>His name is Je&s;us, becau&s;e he &s;aves his people from their &s;ins. Mat</HI>&mdash;1&mdash;The mo&s;t that might be &s;aid here, mu&s;t be waved&mdash;We may name a few things; for we can do lit|tle more&mdash;Chri&s;t heals in a &s;overeign way&mdash;He is under no obligation, beyond his own good plea&s;ure, and eternal purpo&s;e to heal any one. He heals whom he will, and
<PB N="24" REF="016172_0023_0F9BC9D991D6ECD0">
pa&s;&s;es by whom he will&mdash;This we are taught in the &s;acred pages. Chri&s;t is a faithful phy&s;ician&mdash;He never left the patient that he undertook and engaged to cure. None can tax him with the lea&s;t inju&s;tice. He is faithful to do all that he has promi&s;ed to do. The weary and heavy laden, the &s;ick &s;inners upon their clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, will find all to be true which he has told them. Chri&s;t is a mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate phy&s;ician.&mdash;He takes all proper care of all the lambs and &s;heep of his fold. He knows their burdens, not one for whom he died, will be overlooked and lo&s;t&mdash;The name of each is written upon his heart&mdash; He is infinitely kind, and compa&s;&s;ionate&mdash;It was peculiar to him&mdash;<HI>To bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound: To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for a&s;hes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s&mdash;I&s;a.</HI> 61&mdash;<HI>Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t. My yoke is ea&s;y, and my burden is light. Mat.</HI> 11. He proportions their trials to their &s;trength&mdash;Chri&s;t is a powerful phy&s;ician&mdash;There is no di&s;ea&s;e of body nor of mind beyond his power. He came to heal the chief of &s;inners&mdash;Hence there is encouragement to all who have not &s;inned the unpardonable &s;in&mdash;Let our &s;ins be ever &s;o many, and greatly aggravated, yet they &s;hall never re|proach the power, and &s;kill of this phy&s;ician. The con|ver&s;ion of a per&s;ecuting <HI>Paul,</HI> and a murderous <HI>Mana&s;ah,</HI> may remove our fears on this head&mdash;I may not add more here. We &s;hall touch at the improvement&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. We remark in the 1&s;t place, That &s;in &s;ick &s;ouls are ble&s;&s;ed &s;ouls&mdash;Their mourning will be turned into joy. Precious &s;eed is &s;own in &s;uch tears. Sick &s;ouls will wel|come the phy&s;ician. And he has promi&s;ed re&s;t, eternal
<PB N="25" REF="016172_0024_0F9BC9E19B7772C8" MS="y">
re&s;t, and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to &s;uch as come to him. If he gives re&s;t, all is well. No in&s;uperable difficulties can &s;pring from any quarter. Let the &s;oul, if there is &s;uch an one in this crowded a&s;&s;embly, that is borne down with the in|&s;upportable load of &s;in, that feels its infinite vilene&s;s, and internal malignancy, and loaths and hates it&s;elf, and finds it to be impo&s;&s;ible to help it&s;elf, go to Chri&s;t, and throw it&s;elf at his feet; for it has &s;weet encouragement &s;o to do. The conde&s;cen&s;ion and grace of the Redeemer are very wonderful in undertaking &s;uch an arduous work&mdash;his en|treaties are many and pathetic: His arms are ever extend|ed to receive the returning &s;inner. God even commands us to believe. Surely if we come in a &s;uitable manner, he will not &s;end us away&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. Carnal &s;tupid &s;inners have no ground to hope for mercy while they are at ea&s;e&mdash;There is no|thing but terror, and thunder for them. They are going to hell, tho' they think and care nothing a|bout it; as fa&s;t as rolling time can carry them.&mdash; And God only knows how many of us will drop, without making a perceivable blank in creation, into endle&s;s burnings, in a little while: it may be in a few weeks, or months. Then farewel Chri&s;t&punc; and all the rich ble&s;&s;ings of his purcha&s;e: farewel mi|ni&s;ters and &s;inners: farewel friendly in&s;truction, loud warnings, painful labors for our &s;alvation. We &s;hall then be fixed in unchangable hatred of the glorious God, of all holy beings, and holy duties&mdash;We &s;hall, beyond di&s;pute, have di&s;pi&s;ed mercies, coun&s;els, calls, and in&s;tructions, turned into u&s;ele&s;s things.&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. The rea&s;on why &s;inners peri&s;h, is, becau&s;e they will not go to Chri&s;t the phy&s;ician of &s;ouls. The bible attributes it to this. I think therefore, I am warranted to &s;ay the &s;ame&mdash;<HI>Ye will not come unto
<PB N="26" REF="016172_0025_0F9BC9E44F4FCCC0">
me, that ye might have life. John</HI> 5.40. And it is true now of &s;inners as it was 1700 years ago. There is nothing forbids but an unwilling mind. The diffi|culty originates from the oppo&s;ition of our hearts to Chri&s;t&mdash;Were we cordially willing to embrace Chri&s;t upon his own offer, we &s;hould certainly do it. Were we cordially willing, there is nothing in the divine decree <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the coun&s;els of eternity would prevent. True it is, that our hatred of God is &s;o great, &s;o deep rooted, &s;o implacable, we &s;hall never of our own true choice, will an approbation, and hearty ac|ceptance of Chri&s;t. But let it ever be kept in view, and written in indelible characters upon our hearts, that the want of this will is our own fault, it is our &s;in; and likewi&s;e, that God has no where bound him&s;elf to give us one.&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. Suffer me, in the la&s;t place, for I have wearied your patience, to &s;ugge&s;t a few needful cautions, that may tend to prevent our being &s;hip-wrecked upon the &s;ands and rocks that &s;urround us&mdash;Let us be cautioned again&s;t deferring an application to this phy&s;ician&mdash; Delays harden us. We can not boa&s;t of an hour. The next minute is not yet ours. If it comes, it may be the la&s;t. The di&s;temper grows wor&s;e. God is now di&s;honored by delay; Chri&s;t is more affront|ed: the &s;pirit is more &s;lighted; the offers of &s;alva|tion are more undervalued. Our danger encrea&s;es. Delays are dangerous. How many multitudes have lo&s;t their &s;ouls by putting off, and putting off! Now, this hour, this minute, while I am &s;peaking, it is time to go to Chri&s;t&mdash;<HI>Thou fool,</HI> may be &s;aid of any delayers here pre&s;ent, <HI>this night thy &s;oul &s;hall be required of thee.</HI> And what then? "Procra&s;tination is the thief of time"&mdash;Let no one &s;ay it is too late;
<PB N="27" REF="016172_0026_0F9BC9E566AF07C8">
my time is pa&s;t. We do not know. It is certain, that pre&s;ent delay doth not better our circum&s;tances. If we come to Chri&s;t, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t us out. It is al&s;o certain, that if we do not go, we peri&s;h forever. There is no other alternative: Either go, or re&s;olve to peri&s;h.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2ndly. Apply no where el&s;e but to Chri&s;t&mdash; There is no other phy&s;ician, no other &s;avior, no o|ther advocate but Chri&s;t. There is &s;alvation in no other, neither is there any other name given under heaven among men by which we can be &s;aved. Saints and angels can't heal us: men and means can't of them&s;elves do it&mdash;We &s;hall never heal our&s;elves&mdash; There is balm in Gilead, and a phy&s;ician there,&mdash; and no where el&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Let us renounce our&s;elves wholly in point of ju&s;tification before God&mdash;It is a fatal opinion, to &s;uppo&s;e that we can do &s;omething, while &s;inners, to recommend our&s;elves to God, to pacify the Deity, and &s;horten the di&s;tance between heaven and earth&mdash; We can do nothing of this kind. The utmo&s;t that we do in a natural &s;tate is infinitely beneath the di|vine acceptance. We mu&s;t go with all our &s;ins a|bout us to Chri&s;t to be pardoned and healed to purpo&s;e. If we wait till we recommend our&s;elve&s;s, we &s;hall wait forever, and dye in our &s;ins.&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4thly&mdash;If we are healed, let us not attribute it in any mea&s;ure to our&s;elves, and rob Chri&s;t of the whole honor of a total cure&mdash;Let him have all the honor. It is his due. He fitted every in&s;trument for its work and owned it. The &s;ong of &s;aints in heaven is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|to him that loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prie&s;ts un|to God, and his Father; to him be glory and dominion.

Rev</HI>&mdash;1&mdash;And our &s;ong mu&s;t be the &s;ame. We mu&s;t feel the temper of heaven, or we &s;hall never live in heaven.&mdash;</P>
<P>But it is more than time that I draw to a clo&s;e&mdash; However, I think I have a precedent for what I have done. <HI>Paul,</HI> when at <HI>Troas,</HI> expecting to depart on the morrow, preached uncommonly long; de&s;ir|ing to do what good he could, another opportunity might never offer.&mdash;This ea&s;ily introduces the mo&s;t affecting part of my di&s;cour&s;e, my final farewell.&mdash; But what did I &s;ay? My final farewell? Yes, my hearers, I did. This day puts a period to future la|bors among you. This day almo&s;t compleats two years &s;ince my fir&s;t coming. And pray who thought then, we &s;hould this hour have been bidding a long, a long farewell? But in what re&s;pect doth this day differ from former ones? Permit me to tell you&mdash; It puts an end to future regular interviews, &s;tated meet|ings together, and a multitude of kind offices. It puts an end to future opportunity for private in|&s;truction&mdash;We &s;hall &s;ee one another but a few times more: rejoice and weep together no more&mdash;There is a period put to my public labors. I &s;hall preach to you no more; wor&s;hip with you no more; pray with you no more&mdash;this is all over. I &s;hall no more endeavor to open to you the wonders of redemption: the endle&s;s, ever growing wonders of that love, which <HI>Gabriel</HI> plays on every chord&mdash;I &s;hall no more tell you the va&s;t importance, and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of conver&s;ion; nor the freene&s;s, the riches, the &s;overeign|ty of grace di&s;played in the &s;alvation of a &s;inner&mdash; I &s;hall no more, in your hearing, dwell with plea|&s;ure upon the conque&s;ts and triumphs of the cro&s;s&mdash; I &s;hall no more, in this hou&s;e a fre&s;h explain, and

enforce the duties of faith and repentance&mdash;I &s;hall no more with you, for my hearers, a&s;cend to heaven, and unfold the &s;tate of the ble&s;&s;ed, nor unveil the bottomle&s;s pit&mdash;I &s;hall no more, with this congre|gation around me, expo&s;e in its native ba&s;ene&s;s, and deformity, in all its deplorable circum&s;tances, human nature&mdash;Upon the&s;e great and important &s;ubjects, my pen and voice, as to you, will be &s;ilent as the grave. Me thinks pa&s;t time comes fre&s;h to mind, when I well remember, this hou&s;e &s;eemed to hang upon a feeble tongue. And will not you your&s;elves bear me witne&s;s, that I labored to the utmo&s;t, if, at &s;uch a time, &s;ome word might make an indelible impre&s;&s;ion upon a former thoughtle&s;s mind. And &s;hall I never, never have any more &s;uch opportunities in this place, where I have &s;o long been laboring? No, never. They are gone as a dream or vi&s;ion of the night. It is often hard parting from a &s;hort acquaintance: But how much more difficult to leave near and va|luable friends, when the band is &s;trengthened by time, ripened into firmne&s;s by age, and endeared by a thou|&s;and things? Experience this day convinces my friends and me&mdash;It is rending work&mdash;An unexpected Pro|vidence has kept me here laboring till this time. And the &s;ame Providence that &s;eemed at fir&s;t to invite me here, now points it to be my duty to go away. And &s;ince it is the will of heaven I heartily acqui|e&s;ce in it, not with &s;tanding all that can be thrown into the other &s;cale&mdash;But whom do I leave? My near re|lations, that view me as a &s;on and brother. I leave him, who to univer&s;al acceptance and admiration fills the fir&s;t place of honor and importance in the <HI>State.</HI> I leave a large majority of this re&s;pectable congre|gation that have long manife&s;ted an inviolable at|tachment

All the&s;e I leave.&mdash;I thank you, my dear friends, who will, probably, never &s;ee me &s;tand in this de&s;k again, I mo&s;t &s;incerely thank you for your many and frequent kind offices: for the place that I have long had in your affections; for all the prayers that you have put up for me, in &s;ecret, private and public.

I thank you for that readine&s;s and chearfulne&s;s with which you have at|tended my &s;ervices among you: for all your endea|vors to render me comfortable and u&s;eful. I thank the young and old of both &s;exes, that have mani|fe&s;ted a friendly heart, and treated me with unaffect|ed kindne&s;s. And I would thank God in his hou&s;e, if I have done you any good: if I have in&s;tructed, refre&s;hed, and comforted any by the &s;incere milk of the word.&mdash;And if I have been &s;everely handled, and illy dealt with by any that have acted uniform|ly again&s;t my continuance and &s;ettlement, I pray God to forgive them, and open their eyes&mdash;to ble&s;s them in life, at death and thro' eternity&mdash;and I pray, that my dear friends may never remember it to the fu|ture di&s;advantage of this church and &s;ociety; to the continuance of pre&s;ent difficulties&punc; the preventing of the &s;ettling a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, and the de&s;truction of peace.
