<BIBL>GENESIS XIIth CHAPTER, 2d. VERSE.</BIBL>
<Q>AND I WILL MAKE OF THEE A GREAT NATION.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age now read contains a part of that promi&s;e, which God made to Abraham, when he commanded him to depart from his country and from his kindred and from his father's hou&s;e, and to &s;ojourn in a &s;trange land. To induce him to comply with this command of heaven, he is a&s;&s;ured that he &s;hall become a great nation, and &s;hall be rai&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;hed heights of honor, happi|ne&s;s and renown. I will make of thee a great na|tion, &s;ays Jehovah, and I will ble&s;s thee, and make thy name great; and thou &s;halt be a ble&s;&s;ing. And I will ble&s;s them that ble&s;s thee, and cur&s;e him that cur&s;eth thee. This promi&s;e we find fulfilled in the nation of the Jews. From &s;mall beginning they ro&s;e to national greatne&s;s and happine&s;s. They were for a long period, a great, happy and flour|i&s;hing people. Under the protection of divine pro|vidence, they were &s;ecure again&s;t the inva&s;ion of
<PB N="6" REF="033813_0004_0FF9568642B7A5F0">
enemies. God &s;uffered no man to do them harm. He frequently appeared for their protection and deliverance, in times of danger and calamity. He gave them a land flowing with milk and honey and indulged them with all tho&s;e temporal delights, which are nece&s;&s;ary to comfort, plea&s;ure and &s;at|isfaction. God cho&s;e them for his peculiar people and di&s;tingui&s;hed them from all the nations of the earth, in regard to religious privileges. He made them acquainted with his perfections and in&s;truct|ed them in their duty. Unto them pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the &s;ervice of God, and the promi&s;es.</P>
<P>THUS was the promi&s;e fulfilled. God made of Abraham a great nation.</P>
<P>IN the &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall endeavor, as the words before us will naturally lead me, to &s;hew what is nece&s;&s;ary to render a nation great, ac|cording to the &s;en&s;e of our text.</P>
<P>THE requi&s;ites of national greatne&s;s are many and various. In one di&s;cour&s;e it will not be expect|ed that I &s;hould notice them all. To make &s;ome general ob&s;ervations upon the &s;ubject is all that can rea&s;onably be required.</P>
<P>THAT a nation may become great, pro&s;perous and happy it is nece&s;&s;ary that they form into &s;ociety and e&s;tabli&s;h a con&s;titution of civil government, that &s;hall be be&s;t adapted to the general good. What form of government is the be&s;t and mo&s;t eligible has been di&s;puted in all civilized nations, by men of know|ledge and penetration. "Some have been plea|&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="033813_0005_0FF956C561C147F8">
with a monarchical form, others have cho&s;en an ari&s;tocratical; while others, have given the pre|ference to a more popular mode of government."</P>
<P>THE intere&s;ts, manners, cu&s;toms and prejudices of mankind are &s;o variable, that it is very difficult to determine what frame of government will be mo&s;t promotive of the good of any people. But I think we may &s;afely affirm that to be the be&s;t con&s;titution, which abridges the liberties of a peo|ple no further, than is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;afety, pro&s;perity and political happine&s;s. Under &s;uch a con&s;titution, per&s;ons are &s;afe in their intere&s;t, hon|or and property. Authority, when exerci&s;ed con|trary to the general and important end of govern|ment, may be remanded and return into the hands of the people. But the greatne&s;s and happine&s;s of a nation depend as much, if not more, on a wi&s;e and faithful admini&s;tration, than on any particular form of government.</P>
<P>THAT a people may experience the happy ef|fects of a wi&s;e and good admini&s;tration of govern|ment, it is nece&s;&s;ary that their rulers be men of knowledge, integrity and religion. It is very evi|dent, that men, who are inve&s;ted with the legi&s;la|tive authority, ought to have &s;ome acquaintance with mankind, with hi&s;tory and with the various modes of admini&s;tration in different nations. But, e&s;pecially, it is incumbent on civil rulers to be well acquainted with the con&s;titution of the &s;tate in which they live. Without this knowledge they mu&s;t be liable to many errors; and while they in|tend
<PB N="8" REF="033813_0006_0FF9570321505DB8">
to do e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the community, they may be pur&s;uing mea&s;ures, which tend directly to de&s;troy its happine&s;s. We pretend not that it is nece&s;&s;ary civil rulers &s;hould be per&s;ons of collegi|ate education. But they ought, at lea&s;t, to be men of good under&s;tanding, that have a competent knowledge of the rights of mankind, and the nature of government. Ignorant men, men de&s;titute of the&s;e qualifications, will, if rai&s;ed to places of pow|er and tru&s;t, be a cur&s;e, in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing to the community. They will be little more than mean in&s;truments in the hands of men of crafty intrigue. A few individuals, in this ca&s;e, will govern the &s;tate and a great part of the public lo&s;e the benefit of an equal repre&s;entation. That per&s;ons, who are elected officers of government, ought to be men of knowledge and good under&s;tanding, we are taught not only by experience, but by revelation. The Jews were commanded "to take wi&s;e men, and un|der&s;tanding, and known among their tribes, and to make them rulers over them." On the other hand, it was con&s;idered as a great and heavy judgment, when weak and ignorant men were rai&s;ed to &s;ta|tions of power and authority. "Woe unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child."</P>
<P>SOLOMON, when called to &s;it upon the throne of his father David, prayed that God would give him a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart, that he might be able to judge &s;o great a people.</P>
<P>IF the greate&s;t degrees of political knowledge are not an e&s;&s;ential qualification in a ruler, yet he is unfit to be placed at the head of public affairs, who is of inferior abilities, who is unacquainted
<PB N="9" REF="033813_0007_0FF95732D1CB9A60">
with the con&s;titution of the State in which he lives, and who knows not what it is to act right; for he is very liable to abu&s;e his power, and to encroach upon the rights and privileges of the people.</P>
<P>"IN free governments, one ob&s;erves, men are apt to feel, much quicker, than in tho&s;e of a differ|ent form. To touch their liberties, is to touch the apple of their eye, every attempt alarms them, and makes them jealous of further de&s;igns, and &s;ome|times throws them into the hands of factious dema|gogues, who are enemies to all government, and are ever watching opportunities to embarra&s;s public mea&s;ures and to introduce anarchy and confu&s;ion. Where &s;o much, therefore, depends, and where the danger of acting wrong is likely to produce &s;uch mi&s;chievous effects in the community, rulers ought to know very well what it is to act right; where power ends and liberty begins. The more difficult it is to &s;ettle this point, &s;o much the more wi&s;dom, knowledge and prudence do rulers need, and &s;o much the more cautious &s;hould they be in their political conduct.</P>
<P>ANOTHER indi&s;pen&s;able qualification in rulers is integrity. The pro&s;perity of &s;ociety is in their hands, and the greater their wi&s;dom and knowledge are, the more capable they are of de&s;troying the intere&s;t of the community.</P>
<P>IF we have any knowledge of the hi&s;tory of na|tions, we cannot be ignorant of the unhappy and ruinous effects of rai&s;ing to &s;tations of power and tru&s;t men of no integrity, of ba&s;e and corrupt minds, of low art and intrigue. The mo&s;t fatal e|vils
<PB N="10" REF="033813_0008_0FF9576ADDDBEBC0">
in &s;ociety have originated from this cau&s;e.&mdash;How many nations, which once enjoyed the ble&s;|&s;ings of freedom and equal liberty, have either &s;uf|fered national annihilation, or been reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery by men of this de&s;cription? In|deed, where has the nation exi&s;ted, that has been, for a long period, free and happy, while di&s;hone&s;t and unfaithful men were at the head of its public affairs? It cannot be named. But hi&s;tory furni&s;h|es us with an account of many &s;tates and empires, which have been involved in the greate&s;t mi&s;eries, and finally were de&s;troyed by means of corrupt and wicked rulers.</P>
<P>THE republic of Sparta, which flouri&s;hed for almo&s;t &s;even hundred years, and bid defiance to the world, was at la&s;t thrown from the height of polit|ical glory and happine&s;s into the aby&s;s of mi&s;ery and &s;lavery by unprincipled and intriguing men.</P>
<P>THE ruin of the famous republic of Rome origi|nated from the &s;ame cau&s;e. While the reins of government were in the hands of upright and faith|ful men, &s;he flouri&s;hed and was mi&s;tre&s;s of the world; but when per&s;ons of the oppo&s;ite charac|ter were placed at the helm of &s;tate, &s;he lo&s;t her happine&s;s, &s;unk into di&s;grace, and became a &s;lave.</P>
<P>PERFECTLY agreeable to the dictates of rea&s;on, is that ob&s;ervation, "that nothing will &s;o &s;urely, &s;o rapidly bring on the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety and the lo&s;s of the liberties of the people, as want of integrity in rulers."</P>
<P>THE divine oracles, which give us the be&s;t in|&s;tructions
<PB N="11" REF="033813_0009_0FF957A75A37DE48">
how to &s;ecure our pre&s;ent, as well as fu|ture happine&s;s, inform us that "rulers mu&s;t be ju&s;t men, fearers of God, haters of covetou&s;ne&s;s. That, they &s;hake their hands from holding bribes, becau&s;e a gift blindeth the eyes of the wi&s;e, and perverteth the words of the righteous."</P>
<P>REASON and revelation, then concur in &s;upport of this truth, that integrity in civil rulers is an e&s;|&s;ential qualification, and that they only will be mini&s;ters of God for good to the people, who are men of integrity, uprightne&s;s and hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>WE proceed to ob&s;erve, that religion is an im|portant qualification in civil rulers. This fini&s;hes their character. This renders them acceptable to God, and makes them ble&s;&s;ings to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>RELIGION is nece&s;&s;ary to the honor, u&s;efulne&s;s and happine&s;s of all moral agents; but religion is peculiarly requi&s;ite for civil rulers. It adds a dig|nity to their character, commands the e&s;teem and veneration of the community, and makes them, what they ought to be, ble&s;&s;ings to &s;ociety. Of &s;uch importance is religion in civil rulers, that with|out it the be&s;t genius and the greate&s;t knowledge would endanger the welfare of the State, rather than promote the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the pub|lic. Men of enlightened minds and corrupt hearts, men of knowledge, but void of piety and the fear of God, are very un&s;uitable per&s;ons to be entru&s;t|ed with the affairs and concerns of a republic. Per|&s;ons, who fear not God and obey not the go&s;pe of his &s;on will not regard man, nor con&s;ult the in|tere&s;t and well being of civil &s;ociety any further,
<PB N="12" REF="033813_0010_0FF957E77AC98B98">
than what is nece&s;&s;ary to their own aggrandize|ment and the accompli&s;hment of their own private views.</P>
<P>BUT that a nation may become great, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary, that they have wi&s;e upright and pi|ous rulers, but the people al&s;o mu&s;t &s;ubmit to law|ful authority and equitable laws. The doctrine of non re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, we reject with abhorrence. A people cannot, in ju&s;tice be obligated to &s;ubmit to oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical laws. When laws are unju&s;t, not well adapted to the circum&s;tances of the community, and when a compliance with them would be attended with ef|fects injurious to the public, the people have a right fir&s;t to remon&s;trate and then refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But this right belongs only to the majority, the ruling body of the State, and not to any minority. If this principle be not e&s;tabli&s;hed, all civil order is in danger of being brought to an end. When per&s;ons enter into &s;ociety and combine in civil government, they oblige them&s;elves to &s;ubmit to the laws of the State, and it is trifling with &s;ociety and government to refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. It is rela&s;ping into a &s;tate of nature and &s;ubverting the very con&s;titution and ba&s;is of &s;ociety. Obedience to civil authori|ty is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the very being of a com|munity, and every one is an enemy to his country, who refu&s;es &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to its laws.</P>
<P>BUT it is of equal importance to national great|ne&s;s, that laws wi&s;ely enacted and well adapted, be faithfully executed. Laws are not only nece&s;&s;ary to the good order and pro&s;perity of a community,
<PB N="13" REF="033813_0011_0FF9581B9551AC10">
but they mu&s;t al&s;o be executed. Without this, they are perfectly u&s;ele&s;s. Per&s;ons, who di&s;obey the laws of the community, ought to be noticed and brought to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IN every State officers are elected and authoriz|ed to detect and bring to puni&s;hment offenders, and every officer is highly criminal, who neglects this his political duty, who connives at and pa&s;&s;es by breaches of law; for by this neglect he violates his promi&s;e and injures the community. He is an enemy to the State, and ought to be deprived of his authority and commi&s;&s;ion. Unle&s;s the laws of a community are put in force and the executive authority is exerci&s;ed, the legi&s;lature will become contemptible and the State lo&s;e the advantages of civil &s;ociety. Laws will never be obeyed without &s;anctions, and per&s;ons will never be deterred from violating them, unle&s;s criminals be puni&s;hed. Therefore, no act of di&s;obedience ought to be countenanced, when the intere&s;t of the communi|ty is threatened. Conniving at one act of di&s;obe|dience will open the way for another, and finally, all violations of law may pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed, confu|&s;ion and every evil work may enter &s;ociety, and property, and even life it&s;elf become very in&s;ecure.</P>
<P>BENEVOLENCE or public &s;pirit, an attachment to the body politic and the general good, in oppo|&s;ition to partial views, is requi&s;ite to national great|ne&s;s. The grand political object, the good of the whole, ought to be kept in view and animate and direct the conduct of every individual. Per&s;ons, however, in promoting the intere&s;t of &s;ociety are
<PB N="14" REF="033813_0012_0FF95842DE9C1328">
not bound to &s;acrifice all private views, and to act wholly from public motives. Self-pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t law of nature, and to have regard to our own individual happine&s;s is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with a true love to our country. Every member of civil &s;ociety may always &s;eek to promote his own intere&s;t, when it is not attended with injury to the community. But when by any act of this kind the intere&s;t of the community &s;uffers, &s;uch act becomes unlawful and the author of it is governed by unju&s;|tifiable motives. A &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit in civil &s;ociety is de&s;tructive both of private and public intere&s;t, and were this &s;pirit univer&s;ally to prevail, &s;ociety would be &s;ubverted from its ba&s;is, private intere&s;t would be the pur&s;uit of all and the public good engage the attention of none.</P>
<P>ANOTHER e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite of national great|ne&s;s is dome&s;tic peace and concord. The happi|ne&s;s of civil &s;ociety very much depends upon its u|nity. A people may be numerous and wealthy, they may be favoured with a good form of govern|ment and with wi&s;e, upright and religious rulers; yet if dome&s;tic contentions and quarrels prevail a|mong them, their pro&s;pects of national glory and happine&s;s mu&s;t be very gloomy. Their national &s;trength will be continually decrea&s;ing, their wealth con&s;uming, and they, in time, mu&s;t fall a prey to their enemies. Hi&s;tory and experience abundant|ly confirm the truth of our &s;aviour's a&s;&s;ertion "a king|dom divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand." A peo|ple when united may probably &s;tand again&s;t the at|tacks of their enemies, but when they are divided
<PB N="15" REF="033813_0013_0FF95860061AC650">
among them&s;elves, when &s;trife and contentions are prevalent, they mu&s;t fall. One great cau&s;e of the &s;ubvertion of the Jewi&s;h &s;tate and government was divi&s;ion. They were, it is true, obliged to con|tend with a powerful enemy. But they might have with&s;tood the attack of the Romans and be|come victorious, if in heart and mea&s;ures they had been united. The Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory furni&s;hes us with an account of that mo&s;t horrible de&s;truction, which the Roman army made of this unhappily divided people. Every one's &s;word was turned again&s;t his fellow; and they made but a feeble and &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance. They were &s;oon brought to de&s;olation. Their cities were ravaged and con&s;umed by fire, and their government was wholly &s;ubverted. The like divi&s;ions are generally productive of &s;imilar effects. Contentions in &s;ociety are much to be dreaded and &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided. They, when kin|dled, are like fire, they increa&s;e their own flame; where they will terminate and what will be their effects, none can determine. They mu&s;t injure, and they may i&s;&s;ue in the di&s;&s;olution of Society.</P>
<P>BUT let me ob&s;erve further, that a &s;pirit of in|du&s;try among the members of a community is re|qui&s;ite to national greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>EVERY excellent and mental accompli&s;hment is the re&s;ult of enquiry and application. By diligence only can arts and &s;ciences be carried to perfection; and indu&s;try is the means, by which the nece&s;&s;aries, conveniences, and accommodations of life are ob|tained. Rea&s;on and experience teach us that in|du&s;try is conducive to national glory and pro&s;per|ity.
<PB N="16" REF="033813_0014_0FF95870A1E14B48">
It is this that leads to honor, to wealth, to wi&s;dom, and to that bravery and magnanimity, which are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to political happine&s;s; and defence again&s;t the inva&s;ion of enemies. But idle|ne&s;s is the parent of poverty, cowardice, weakne&s;s, ignorance, and every evil that infe&s;ts human &s;o|ciety. It is indu&s;try, that &s;upports rulers and &s;ub|jects, that &s;upplies the wants of the needy and fills the garners of the wealthy, that keeps in motion the wheels of government and &s;upports &s;ociety. "There cannot be a flouri&s;hing people without in|du&s;try, whatever other advantages they may en|joy; for without this the benefits of nature mu&s;t be, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t and the ble&s;&s;ings of pro|vidence thrown away. There are flouri&s;hing na|tions in the world, that wholly owe their power and pro&s;perity, next to the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, to their being remarkably indu&s;trious, which has rai&s;ed and advanced them in &s;pite of many great ob&s;tacles and di&s;couraging difficulties, that &s;tood in their way; and there are other nations which, notwith&s;tanding many and great national advantages, have never di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for want of taking the pains nece&s;&s;ary thereto: Their &s;loth has kept them down and buried them in ob&s;curity, they have fallen a &s;acrifice to their inactivity." "The hand of the diligent &s;hall bear rule, but the &s;lothful &s;hall be under tribute."</P>
<P>But we proceed to ob&s;erve, that a proper atten|tion to the means of education and knowledge is nece&s;&s;ary to national greatne&s;s. Knowledge is re|qui&s;ite to the practice of every private and public
<PB N="17" REF="033813_0015_0FF95882F68A14F8">
virtue. A di&s;po&s;ition to do well, without knowing how to perform, can be but of little u&s;e. In the early ages of the world the civil &s;tate of mankind was much more imperfect, than it is at this more enlightened period. Mankind were imper|fectly acquainted with the rights of human nature. The arts and &s;ciences were little cultivated. The principles of benevolence and &s;ociability lay dor|mant, for want of exerci&s;e and improvement. The minds of men were barbarous and their manners un&s;ocial. In this &s;tate of ignorance they were ca|pable of forming at be&s;t, only &s;mall combinations, and a few families con&s;tituted a nation.</P>
<P>They were de&s;titute of that knowledge, which is nece&s;&s;ary to forming exten&s;ive empires, and &s;up|porting them in oppo&s;ition to the influence of fac|tion. This mode of living was not much prefer|able to that, which is practiced in a &s;tate of nature. Their uncultivated minds would not admit of their becoming wealthy and powerful; and their genius was exerted mo&s;tly to de&s;troy tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed them. But by attending to the means of knowl|edge mankind have made the mo&s;t valuable im|provements. They have enlarged their ideas of living and becoming great and honorable. The rights of human nature are better under&s;tood, and the ad|vantages ari&s;ing from cultivating the arts and &s;ciences have been &s;en&s;ibly felt. If we may judge of the improvements po&s;&s;ible to be made by nations, from the improvements in pa&s;t ages, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that knowledge may &s;o hereafter increa&s;e, as to put an end to mo&s;t of the evils that grow out

<P>WE may further ob&s;erve, that a free and exten|&s;ive commerce is nece&s;&s;ary to national greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is a rare thing that one country or kingdom will afford its inhabitants all the nece&s;&s;aries, con|veniences and ornaments of life. Different &s;oils are compo&s;ed of different properties, and are cal|culated for different production. One country, therefore, mu&s;t be dependent on others for its produc|tions by way of commerce; and this may be done without injury to any, but, on the contrary, with great advantage to all.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there are few countries, perhaps none that produces every thing nece&s;&s;ary to ag|grandize a nation, yet it may produce many things, that are, in a degree &s;uperfluous and may be ex|changed for other commodities more nece&s;&s;ary, u&s;eful and ornamental. In this way the wants of one country may be &s;upplied by the &s;uperfluities of another. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tions of the earth, in the pre&s;ent age of the world, have much greater advantages in point of commerce, than the nations, that exi&s;ted a few centuries before them.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="033813_0017_0FF9589C2BF9A120">
THEY had then made but &s;mall improvements in the art of navigation&punc; which is nece&s;&s;ary to a large, commodious and profitable commerce with di&s;tant countries. But the nations of the earth have now made &s;uch improvement in the art of na|vigation as enables them to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of commerce with ea&s;e, dispatch and general &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT we may ob&s;erve, that martial power is re|qui&s;ite to national greatne&s;s. In the pre&s;ent im|perfect &s;tate of things, no nation is to expect to be always exempt from the unju&s;t attacks of foreign enemies. Small occa&s;ions are often productive of di&s;cord and warlike contentions. A nation ought, therefore, ever to be in a capacity to act with vigour in its own defence.</P>
<P>THEY ought to be well acquainted with the arts of war; and to put their country in a proper po&s;ture of defence by &s;ea and land. They ought to main|tain finances, amply an&s;wering to the pecuniary exigences of the State; to an&s;wer with fidelity and di&s;patch the ju&s;t demands of tho&s;e, who ri&s;que their lives in the defence of their country. This is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to national honor and &s;afety.</P>
<P>WE ob&s;erve further, that if a people would be great and happy, they mu&s;t be careful of their civ|il rights and privileges. The &s;ubjects of a repub|lican government mu&s;t to &s;ecure their liberties and perpetuate their happine&s;s be attentive to their po|litical rights, and with prudence and caution di&s;|charge their duty at free and popular elections. It is not difficult, many times, for men of crafty in|trigue
<PB N="20" REF="033813_0018_0FF958AED79717D0">
to obtain offices of importance, and to prevent the operation of the be&s;t civil con&s;titution and laws. Bribery and an undue influence in e|lections may have this effect. A free and unbia&s;&s;ed election is the grand bulwark of natural and civil liberty. And when a people give their &s;uffrages in favor of crafty, ignorant and unprincipled men, they are de&s;titute of that love to their country, which is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the continuance of its liberties and independence. They do not con|&s;ider, that when the wicked, un&s;kilful and in|triguing bear rule, the liberties of the &s;ubjects are in danger and the people have rea&s;on to mourn; and that when the righteous, men of knowledge, integrity and religion are in authority, the&s;e lib|erties are &s;ecure and the people may rejoice. It cannot be denied, that &s;ome per&s;ons, who have lived under a free and popular government, have di&s;covered great depravity of &s;oul by trifling with their civil privileges and &s;elling their birthright for a me&s;s of pottage, or a more contemptible com|pen&s;ation. But all, who are true friends to their country, will reject with abhorrence the idea of bribery in elections or giving their votes in favor of any men for public offices, but per&s;ons of wi&s;|dom, integrity and religion. They will weep, that there &s;hould be the lea&s;t rea&s;on to fear that their fellow citizens will ever become regardle&s;s of their right of elections, or indifferent to the qualifica|tions of the per&s;ons, whom they elect for their civ|il rulers; that offices of tru&s;t, honor and profit &s;hould become venal, and that the ignorant, &s;hame|le&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="033813_0019_0FF958BE223E4028">
and irreligious &s;hould be as fair &amp; eligible candi|dates as the wi&s;e, mode&s;t and virtuous. They will dete&s;t the man who attempts to buy their vote, or &s;eeks to obtain the honors of his country by a|ny other means, than that of merit.</P>
<P>WE ob&s;erve once more, that religion is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to national greatne&s;s and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>RELIGION is the ba&s;is of public, as well as pri|vate happine&s;s. A body politic cannot have a pro&s;|perous &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, without the practice of virtue. "Godline&s;s is profitable to all things." It is this that exalteth a nation; "but &s;in is the reproach of any people." According as virtue or vice prevail, &s;o will a people pro&s;per or decay. Vice and iniquity are the grand in&s;truments of de&s;truction in every po|litical con&s;titution. They generally have the ope|ration and effect of natural cau&s;es. But righteou&s;|ne&s;s is productive of oppo&s;ite effects. It in&s;ures the protection and ble&s;&s;ing of the great Governor of the univer&s;e. It is the only durable ba&s;is of good government, of good laws, of mutual confidence, and pro&s;perity. Where this prevails a people will not fail to ri&s;e to the highe&s;t degrees of national glory and felicity. The pillars of their con&s;titu|tion will be as durable as the hills and their happi|ne&s;s as la&s;ting as time.</P>
<P>No man, therefore, can better evidence his love for his country, than by endeavouring, in his pro|per &s;phere, to prevent the contagious &s;pread of vice, or to promote the influence of morality and reli|gion. "Contemptible is that man's pretended love to his country who with an o&s;tentatious zeal for her
<PB N="22" REF="033813_0020_0FF8D3D4E8739F10">
credit, her finances, or civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, entire|ly di&s;regards that which is the ba&s;is of the whole.</P>
<P>HE is like the man who is careful to repair and adorn &s;ome le&s;s e&s;&s;ential parts of a building, whil&s;t he &s;uffers the foundation to be undermined, which failing the whole tumbles into ruins."</P>
<P>THE truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations is confirmed by the univer&s;al hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>THE Jews, we are a&s;&s;ured by hi&s;tory, were a happy and flouri&s;hing people, while they were gov|erned by principles of piety and virtue. While they were willing and obedient they ate the good of the land. I&s;rael then dwelt in &s;afety; the foun|tain of Jacob was upon a land of corn and wine; his heavens dropped down dew; the Lord was the &s;hield of his help, and the &s;word of his excellency. But, when the Jews became abandoned to vice, when irreligion prevailed among them, the Lord for&s;ook them; and their glory and happine&s;s de|parted. They became an ea&s;y prey to their ene|mies. They were carried into captivity, and final de&s;truction was the fate of their policy, church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame cau&s;e the corruption, of morals and principles, may be traced the complete ruin of the republics of Athens and Rome.</P>
<P>As long as temperance, frugality, cha&s;tity, and other virtues were national, and &s;pread among them, they flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed; but when im|piety and profanene&s;s, luxury and debauchery formed their public character and manners their empire immediately began to decline and decay.
<PB N="23" REF="033813_0021_0FF958DB161D7BD8">
Their national glory continued to decrea&s;e 'till it was entirely lo&s;t, their con&s;titution was wholly &s;ub|verted, and tho&s;e, who &s;urvived the de&s;truction of their government were left to groan under the rod of cruel and barbarous tyrants. A corruption of manners and numerous crimes, &s;ays a writer, made greater havoc in the city of Rome, than the mightie&s;t armies could have done, and in that man|ner avenged the conquered globe.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the evil effects of irreligion and immorality, with re&s;pect to the well being of civil &s;ociety. May Americans take warning and avoid the rocks, upon which &s;o many thou&s;ands have been da&s;hed in pieces.</P>
<P>FROM the preceeding ob&s;ervations, may not the people of America felicitate them&s;elves, and en|tertain the mo&s;t plea&s;ing hopes of their future na|tional greatne&s;s? We po&s;&s;e&s;s at pre&s;ent many of the advantages which prepare the way for national importance. The climate of the United States is favourable to health and population. Our &s;itua|tion is neither within the torrid or frigid zone, but the temperate. Whil&s;t we are warned by winds &s;tretching over a large extent of country from the equator, the heat is tempered by cooling breezes from the &s;ea and more northern climes. We are al&s;o favoured with a country fertile in its &s;oil. There are but few countries &s;uited to every pro|duction; nor can we &s;uppo&s;e this is the ca&s;e with America. But its productions are &s;ufficient to &s;upply the wants and many of the luxuries of hu|man life; and to furni&s;h ample materials for com|merce.
<PB N="24" REF="033813_0022_0FF958E4F847C6A0">
Diligence and oeconomy in the common cla&s;s of people is one portrait in our national char|acter. Improvements in the arts and &s;ciences are increa&s;ing, and knowledge is progre&s;&s;ing. The &s;everal States have not only civil con&s;titutions founded on equal rights, but they are combined in one general federation under a national con&s;titution of government, which &s;erves to unite the wi&s;dom, the wealth and the power of the whole, for the im|provement, the defence and aggrandizement of the nation. We have the power of appointing our governors, &s;enators, legi&s;lators, and magi&s;trates, our laws are made and executed by per&s;ons elect|ed by, and from among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>WE are al&s;o favoured with the mo&s;t exalted reli|gious privileges and liberties. We have a revela|tion from heaven, containing the mo&s;t excellent &s;y&s;tem of doctrines and precepts, and the mo&s;t weighty motives to piety and virtue. We enjoy without mole&s;tation the rights of con&s;cience, every one may judge for him&s;elf in matters of faith, and may choo&s;e &s;uch mode of wor&s;hip as his rea&s;|on and con&s;cience may dictate.</P>
<P>THESE are national advantages and ble&s;&s;ings, which we have received of God and which we hold under the protection of his good providence. But our long enjoying them ultimately depends on a rea&s;onable and religious improvement of them.</P>
<P>A republican government e&s;&s;entially depends on public virtue. Where there is a general want of virtue in the people and admini&s;trators of govern|ment, it becomes feeble and contemptible; &amp; mu&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="033813_0023_0FF955C66D69A7F8">
&s;oon be di&s;&s;olved. Whether there be &s;ufficient virtue in the people and admini&s;trators of the gov|ernment in the&s;e United States long to maintain it, in its pre&s;ent form, time and experience only can a&s;certain.</P>
<P>WE as a people have enjoyed a great degree of political happine&s;s for many years. But our future pro&s;pects of national happine&s;s are not &s;o flattering as what they have been in time pa&s;t. The republic of France has been, and &s;till is attempting to in|terrupt our pro&s;perity. Proud, imperious and en|vious Britain has attempted the &s;ame; but &s;he has promi&s;ed us reparation, and has cea&s;ed to in&s;ult us. France continues her abu&s;es and greatly annoys our happine&s;s, and in&s;tead of di&s;covering the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to make us &s;atisfaction, in&s;ultingly de|mands money, money from us to reward her for the infamous treatment, which &s;he has offered to Ame|rica. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to remind you of the de|predations which have, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, been made upon our commerce by European nations. I pre&s;ume they are fre&s;h in your memories. But, I would call your attention to that which is both our duty and happine&s;s, to love and defend our coun|try. We are not Europeans, but Americans. Let us prove our&s;elves to be worthy of the name by di&s;|covering a &s;trong and firm attachment to the honor and happine&s;s of our nation.</P>
<P>IT ought to be our prayer that tho&s;e, who are at the head of our government, may have wi&s;dom from above to direct; and it is a matter of the greate&s;t importance that we be united among our|&s;elves,
<PB N="26" REF="033813_0024_0FF958F2970A8770">
and be reconciled to the admini&s;trations of our national government; and cheerfully unite our &s;trength to &s;upport our independence, our rights and liberties again&s;t the inva&s;ion of a foreign en|emy.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, that France befriended us in our con|te&s;t with Britain, and that we are indebted to her for our &s;alvation. It is not my de&s;ign to enter into the political di&s;putes of the pre&s;ent day; but I will venture to a&s;&s;ert we cannot be under obligations to re&s;ign our liberties to any nation, whether &s;he may have been a friend or a foe. It is our duty to defend our liberties and &s;upport our indepen|dence again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of all enemies. We ought to lay a&s;ide all prejudices and contentions, and in heart and mea&s;ures be united. On this depends our national &s;trength, &s;ecurity and honor. "Unit|ed we &s;tand, but divided we fall." Let us then guard again&s;t that party &s;pirit, which has &s;o much prevailed in our land, as to tarni&s;h our glory and injure our happine&s;s. It is &s;aid, that this &s;pirit of late has con&s;iderably abated. If this be a truth, we ought heartily to rejoice, and to exert our&s;elves in expelling it wholly from among us. We ought to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours to prevent conten|tions and promote concord. To &s;timulate us to the mo&s;t laudable exertions of this kind, let us keep in mind, that nothing can have a greater ten|dency to bring on the di&s;&s;olution of our republic and make us the &s;port of foreign nations, than di|vi&s;ion among our&s;elves. Divi&s;ion is the bane of &s;ociety.</P>

THOSE jarring aims and interfering intere&s;ts, which are produced by it, mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;tops a|mong the wheels of government, embarra&s;s public mea&s;ures, and greatly annoy the happine&s;s of a people. "Where &s;trife is there is confu&s;ion and every evil work."</P>
<P>IF ever our republic is de&s;troyed and we lo&s;e our liberties and independence, it mu&s;t be by be|ing divided again&s;t our&s;elves. Such is our di&s;tance from the powerful nations of the world, and &s;o great is our national &s;trength, and wealth, that we can be brought to ruin only by that inte&s;tine &s;trife, which preys upon our vitals and cuts the &s;inews of our gov|ernment. If then we have any regard to our own hap|pine&s;s or true love to our country, let us manife&s;t it, by putting an end to our unhappy divi&s;ions and following after the things, which make for peace.</P>
<P>LET us cea&s;e to exa&s;perate each other with vi|rulent words, or the reproachful term of Jacobin or Tory. Let us cultivate brotherly love and &s;trive to be good citizens and true Americans. Let us di&s;cover our patrioti&s;m by being well affected to|wards our con&s;titution, and by encouraging and a&s;|&s;i&s;ting the admini&s;trators of our government.

<P>THE honorable Council, the honorable Senate, and Repre&s;entatives will accept of that re&s;pect which is due to their character and important &s;ta|tion.</P>
<P>FROM the pa&s;t experience, which we have had a wi&s;e and faithful admini&s;tration of govern|ment in this State, we now tru&s;t with our civil Fa|thers, every thing dear in civil and &s;ocial life. We flatter our&s;elves, they will be mini&s;ters of God for good to this people, and in heart and mea&s;ures u|nite to promote the be&s;t intere&s;t of their con&s;titu|ents. It is a day of anxious expectation, of trouble and perplexity, but wi&s;dom is profitable to direct. May this re&s;pectable body "acknowledge God in all their ways, and may he direct their &s;teps."&mdash;</P>
<P>LET us all acknowledge the being and provi|dence of God, and be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the govern|ment of the great di&s;po&s;er of events and the gov|ernor of the univer&s;e. How far the divine Being by his influence interpo&s;es in the affairs of &s;tates &amp; empires is not ea&s;y to determine. Rea&s;on and re|velation, however, lead us to &s;uppo&s;e, that the ri&s;e, continuance, and fall of empires is under his wi&s;e and &s;upreme direction. The nations of the world, therefore, in their political conduct ought to de|pend on him for direction. They ought to culti|vate
<PB N="29" REF="033813_0027_0FF959209BA4EB68">
the principles of piety and virtue that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> may &s;ecure his favor and obtain his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY, the principles of public virtue ought to be exerci&s;ed and improved. National ex|i&s;tence e&s;&s;entially depends on this. This has ever been the ca&s;e, in the ri&s;e and advancement, and in the decline and &s;ubver&s;ion of &s;tates and empires. On this a good con&s;titution depends. It is this that leads the way to frugality, diligence and oeconomy, obedience to whole&s;ome laws and regulations, to union, benevolence and peace.</P>
<P>BUT above all let us attend to the things, that relate to our happine&s;s beyond the confines of time. Let us cultivate the habits of piety and virtue, that we may become &s;ubjects of that kingdom of righte|ousne&s;s and peace, which will &s;urvive every change, and continue after all the kingdoms of this world ex|pire in the di&s;&s;olution of nature.</P>
