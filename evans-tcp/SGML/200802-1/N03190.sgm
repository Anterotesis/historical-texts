<Q><HI>The LORD is a Man of War: The LORD is His Name.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are part of the <HI>Tri|umphant Song,</HI> which Mo&s;es the <HI>Captain General of the Ho&s;ts of I&s;rael,</HI> indited by Divine In&s;piration, to expre&s;s their Gratitude to GOD, and to celebrate His Name &amp; Prai&s;e, for their <HI>miraculous Deliverance</HI> from the Hands of their enraged Enemies, at the Sea, even at the <HI>Red</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>This Marvellous work or wonder is often men|tion'd to the Honour of GOD's excellent Maje&s;ty both in the Old Te&s;tament and in the New; and it is a wonderful work to be always remembred by his Church and People to the end of the World; e&s;|pecially
<PB N="2" REF="003860_0004_100265830B458368">
&s;ince it was Typical of our Eternal Re|demption and Spiritual Deliverance by CHRIST the Captain of our Salvation.</P>
<P>The time would fail me, to give an Hi&s;torical Narration of the whole matter. It &s;hall &s;uffice therefore to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>That after the Children of I&s;rael had obtain'd leave from Pharaoh their cruel Oppre&s;&s;or, to depart out of Egypt, and they had <HI>March'd</HI> to the Borders of His Kingdom; it repented this ambitious Mo|narch, and vexed his Soul, that he had con&s;ented thereunto; though he had &s;tood it out even to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>He re&s;olves therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring them back &amp; rein&s;lave them, or however to be thorough|ly reveng'd on them, for tho&s;e Plagues he had been vi&s;ited with upon their account. Accordingly he <HI>Levies</HI> a numerous Army, and mu&s;ter'd all his forces of Chariots and Hor&s;emen; for it is thought, he took none of the Foot with him, becau&s;e the King's Bu&s;ine&s;s required ha&s;te.</P>
<P>Then does he declare his purpo&s;es at the Head of his CAVALRY, a&s;&s;ures them of the Victory before the Engagement, and that his brandi&s;h'd Sword &s;hould reduce the Fugitives, or be Drunk with the Blood of the Slain. Context ver. 9. <HI>The enemy &s;aid, I will pur&s;ue, I will overtake, I will divide the &s;poil: my lu&s;t &s;hall be &s;ati&s;fied upon them, I will draw my &s;word, my hand &s;hall de&s;troy them.</HI> 'Tis delivered in an elegant figure, and beauteous form of Speech, but the matter of it is Proud and In&s;olent without a parallel! Surely he had forgot his pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;le&s;s attempts to keep them in Slavery, or that GOD had by his powerful Arm broken their Yoke; and vi&s;ited
<PB N="3" REF="003860_0005_1002060CC929B400">
the Egyptians with a &s;eries of Judgments, till 'twas thought they them&s;elves, &s;hould be next &s;truck dead by the blow of his Hand. "Or, did he think that GOD's Arm was now &s;hortned, that his Weapons were blunted, and that the Magazene of his Plagues was waited, or that his Strength was too weak to pre&s;erve tho&s;e whom he had Redeemed with an High Hand?" However, his Heart being hard|ned, and tru&s;ting to his Sword and Militia, he ru&s;h'd &s;wiftly on to his own De&s;truction, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>It's true, he had now to deal with an unarmed People, unprovided for Defence, and who&s;e late Slavery had rendred them unfit for Military Enter|prizes; and although they went out in good order, in <HI>Rank</HI> and <HI>File;</HI> having five in a Rank, as &s;ome; or in five <HI>Squadrons</HI> as others; yet they were a very unequal Match for a well furni&s;h'd and di&s;ciplin'd Army. Neverthele&s;s Pharaoh had but little rea&s;on to promi&s;e him&s;elf the Victory, and to glory in his &s;ucce&s;s beforehand, becau&s;e I&s;rael had the &s;ame Almighty Power to protect them in their March, that had bro't them out of their Bondage.</P>
<P>Thus did Si&s;era's Mother once vainly Triumph in a victorious hope before the Battle of her Son: But though &s;he Sung <HI>Te Deum</HI> before the Conque&s;t, yet after the Engagement &s;he chang'd it for the Mournful Notes of <HI>Domine Mi&s;erere Mei!</HI> And it was much like this, but wor&s;e, in the ca&s;e before us!&mdash;</P>
<P>The Egyptian Ho&s;ts pur&s;u'd till they came near to the I&s;raeliti&s;h Armies: who had <HI>encamp'd</HI> by Di|vine Order before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the Sea, over again&s;t Baal-zephon: And when they beheld the Chariots behind them, they were thrown into the greate&s;t fear and amazement; for
<PB N="4" REF="003860_0006_100265848D1336B8">
they were &s;o encompa&s;s'd on every &s;ide, that De|&s;truction &s;eem'd unavoidable.</P>
<P>They beheld a Deep Sea before them, as &s;ome &s;ay, three Leagues over; a numerous and potent Army behind them fir'd with Indignation &amp; Rage; on the one hand was a range of deep and craggy Rocks, and Mountains that were impa&s;&s;ible; and on the other, as &s;ome think, Forts and Garri&s;ons upon the Frontiers of Egypt. And in the mid&s;t of them&s;elves, what a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e and Murmurs e&s;pecially among their Women &amp; Children? every Heart panted for fear, and palene&s;s &s;eiz'd every Face; that, Unarm'd and Defen&s;ele&s;s as they were, they &s;hould lye at the Mercy of a <HI>Bloody-Tyrant,</HI> and a <HI>Savage Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>Now in <HI>this Mount the Lord was &s;een:</HI> and the People &s;tood &s;till to behold the Salvation of the Lord! The GOD of their Fathers commanded Mo&s;es to &s;tretch forth his hand over that arm of the Sea; and by a &s;trong Ea&s;t-wind he cau&s;ed it to go back; He made it as the dry Land, and the Waters were divided. "The Sea &s;uffers violence to pre&s;erve GOD's People, and that Liquid Element is tran&s;|form'd as it were into a Wall of Bra&s;s."</P>
<P>GOD Him&s;elf march'd before them in the Pillar of Fire as their <HI>Leader;</HI> and was in the Pillar of Cloud behind them as their <HI>Rere-ward;</HI> and the Waters were a Wall to them, that the Egyptians might not charge them in the <HI>Flank</HI> either on the <HI>Right or Left:</HI> and they pa&s;s'd &s;afely to the op|po&s;ite &s;hore.</P>
<P>The Egyptians being Infatuated, in the heat of their pur&s;uit, went in after them, into the mid&s;t of the Sea; and here they march'd for &s;ome time as
<PB N="5" REF="003860_0007_1002658703D552C0">
&s;afely and triumphantly as I&s;rael did; till the Lord <HI>looked</HI> upon their Ho&s;t and troubled them. Some think that they heard or &s;aw &s;uch voices or &s;ight from the Pillar of Cloud, which put them into the greate&s;t Con&s;ternation, and &s;truck them with a <HI>panic</HI> Fear. They drove on heavily, plung'd almo&s;t every &s;tep, and would fain have Retreated, but 'twas all in vain.</P>
<P>JEHOVAH is now re&s;olv'd to be <HI>Eas'd</HI> of his <HI>Ene|mies,</HI> and to be <HI>Aveng'd</HI> on His <HI>Adver&s;aries:</HI> where|fore when the Ho&s;ts &amp; People of I&s;rael, and their Sub&s;tance were &s;afely arriv'd on the other &s;ide; Then did God Command Mo&s;es His Servant again to &s;tretch forth his hand; he did &s;o, and the <HI>Wa|ters</HI> returned to their place, and overwhelm'd the <HI>whole Egyptian Ho&s;t,</HI> &s;o that not &s;o much as one e&s;caped. God blew with His Wind, which made the meeting of the Floods more &s;wift and boi&s;terous; and they were &s;uddenly and irrecoverably lo&s;t. Context ver. 10. <HI>Thou did&s;t blow with thy wind, the &s;ea covered them: they &s;ank as lead in the mighty waters.</HI></P>
<P>Come &s;ee what fearful De&s;olations the Lord has made! The former Plagues were but &s;maller wounds in the Aegyptian &s;tate, but now the glory, power and &s;trength of Egypt, are buried in the Sea to their utter ruin.</P>
<P>The I&s;raelites &s;aw their Bodies afterwards &s;cat|ter'd upon the Sea &s;hore numerous as the &s;ands: This Tragical Spectacle greatly affected the Peo|ple; as well as the wondrous Mercy they had re|ceiv'd at God's Hand: They were now a&s;hamed of their pa&s;t Murmurs &amp; Unbelief, &amp; were re&s;olv'd to tru&s;t in the Name of the Lord, and to <HI>Magnify</HI> their God for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003860_0008_1002061263848780">
To a&s;&s;i&s;t them in this Duty, Mo&s;es the Man of GOD, pens This Divine Song, which is a PANIGYRIC to the prai&s;e of GOD's Power in their Salvation, and of his Victory over their Enemies. Mo&s;es led in the &s;acred Anthem; the whole A&s;&s;embly joins him in it; and how harmonious the Sound, how &s;incere and exalted the Prai&s;e?</P>
<P>And as it was de&s;ign'd to give that glory to GOD which was due to his Name; &s;o to Him he directs it, under a Name and Title &s;uited to the great oc|ca&s;ion; as in the words read, <HI>The LORD is a Man of War;</HI> the Lord is his Name Which intimates that the LORD JEHOVAH is mo&s;t &s;kilful powerful and &s;ucce&s;&s;ful in all his Engagements again&s;t His and his People's Enemies.&mdash;The phra&s;e a <HI>Man of War</HI> is de&s;criptive of an <HI>eminent and compleat War|rior; mo&s;t expert and valiant in Wars and Battles.</HI> It is a form of Speech u&s;ual in the Scripture, as Inter|preters &s;hew us. Thus a Man of Eloquence, of a &s;oft and fluent Tongue, is call'd a Man of Words, Exod. 10. 4. <HI>And Mo&s;es &s;aid unto the Lord, O my Lord; I am not Eloquent; or a Man of Words,</HI> as the Margin has it according to the Original. So a Strong and Mighty Man, is called a Man of Arm, Job 22. 8 <HI>But as for the Mighty Man &amp;c.</HI> the Margin pre&s;erves the Hebrai&s;m and reads it, the <HI>Man of Arm;</HI> as if he was all Arm, Strength and Power. And thus a <HI>Man of War,</HI> denotes an ex|perienc'd, expert, couragious &amp; victorious Warrior, 1 Sam. 17. 33. <HI>Thou art but a Youth, and He a Man of War from his Youth.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e that the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>a Man of War,</HI> being applied to the Lord Jehovah, does intimate that JESUS CHRIST who is Man as well as GOD, is intended in the Words. However that be, &s;o it is indeed, that He is the Captain of our
<PB N="7" REF="003860_0009_10026589803A9800">
Salvation, the Captain of the LORD's Ho&s;ts, and victorious over his Enemies. Jo&s;hua beheld him at Jericho, in the <HI>form of a Man</HI> with a Sword drawn in his Hand; and when He enquired who he was &amp;c. He an&s;wered that He was Prince or <HI>Captain of the Ho&s;ts of the LORD:</HI> and as &s;uch, He fell on his face and wor&s;hipped Him John the beloved Di&s;ciple in his vi&s;ions of Him, &s;aw a Two-edged Sword proceeding out of His Mouth, and on his Ve&s;ture and on his Thigh a Name writ|ten, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and the <HI>Armies following after Him.</HI> I&s;aiah beheld Him with his Prophetical Eye, in His Triumphant re|turn from his Conque&s;ts, and Victory over his E|nemies, I&s;ai. 63 init. <HI>Who is This that cometh from Edom, with d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatne&s;s of his Strength? I that &s;peak in righteou&s;ne&s;s, Mighty to &s;ave Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine fat? I have trodden the wine pre&s;s alone &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctrinal Ob&s;ervation from the Words may be this,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That the LORD GOD of I&s;rael, is e|minently a Man of War.</HI></P>
<P>Now in the management of this point, I &s;hall attempt,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To &s;ay what is contained in This De&s;crip|tion of the Almighty; or in&s;tance in &s;everal things, wherein it evidently appears, that GOD the LORD is by way of eminence, a Man of War.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall briefly apply the truth in &s;ome u&s;eful Inferences and Reflections; and more par|ticularly
<PB N="8" REF="003860_0010_1002658B03FCEF60">
with a view to the occa&s;ional Solemnities and Military Actions of the Day.</P>
<P>I. <HI>I am to &s;ay what is contain'd in this de&s;cription of the Almighty, that He is a Man of War; and in|&s;tance in &s;everal Things, wherein it evidently appears and manife&s;ts it &s;elf.</HI> And this may be done in the &s;everal following particulars, which may &s;uffice to illu&s;trate the truth.</P>
<P>I. <HI>The LORD is eminently a Man of War, as He is the Chief and ab&s;olute Monarch &amp;</HI> Commander of all the Creatures <HI>which He has made.</HI></P>
<P>The LORD He is GOD; He hath made all Things, and for His Plea&s;ure and Glory they are and were Created. He uttered forth the Word of his Al|mighty <HI>Flat</HI> and all things &s;tarted into Being. He hath made the Heavens, yea the Heaven of Hea|vens with all their Ho&s;ts, the Earth and all that is thereon, and the great and wide Sea, with the in|numerable things that are therein.</P>
<P>And as it is His Divine Prerogative upon this account, &s;o GOD is the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> and <HI>only Potentate,</HI> His Kingdom is an Everla&s;ting Kingdom; and His Dominion ruleth over ALL.&mdash;</P>
<P>The <HI>Glorious Armies of Heaven</HI> above; the Wi&s;e and Mighty Angels of His pre&s;ence, which are pe|culiarly His Ho&s;ts; and the <HI>innumerable Inhabitants of the Earth;</HI> and the <HI>forlorn Regions of the Prince of Darkne&s;s,</HI> his principalities and powers, are all under His Commands or Re&s;traints, and at His ab|&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al. "Of the former of the&s;e, God has <HI>&s;tanding</HI> Armies that were never di&s;banded: regu|lar and well Di&s;ciplin'd Troops, that are always ready, never at a lo&s;s, never Mutiny; they are <HI>ve|terane</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="003860_0011_1002658D8BEE3AD0">
Soldiers, that have been long in His Service; and &s;o victorious that they never fail'd of Succe&s;s, and never will, while they Obey the voice of their King and God."</P>
<P>And not only rational and moral Agents, but the <HI>Animate and Inanimate World</HI> are governed and employed by Him.</P>
<P>The Bea&s;ts and Birds, all In&s;ects, and Reptiles, and the numerous Things that creep in the Sea; and even the fiercer <HI>Crocodile,</HI> and the invulnerable <HI>Leviathan</HI> belong to his Ho&s;ts and Armies.</P>
<P>So the Light and Darkne&s;s, Fire &amp; Hail, Snow and Vapour, Thunder and Lightning, Stormy Wind and Tempe&s;ts, are all of his Divine Artillery, and he makes them In&s;truments in his Hand, to the Vexation &amp; De&s;truction of his Enemies when|ever he &s;ees meet.</P>
<P>He &s;ent forth a <HI>Detachment</HI> from mo&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Regiments,</HI> again&s;t the People and Kingdom of E|gypt, and they were con&s;umed and devoured by them. And the Scriptures furni&s;h us with many other in&s;tances of this kind, which I &s;tay not now to mention.</P>
<P>Upon this account then, the LORD may be call'd by way of eminence a Man of War; as all the Ar|mies of the Creatures above and below, from the <HI>Highe&s;t Angel</HI> to the mo&s;t contemptible <HI>Worm,</HI> yea to the mo&s;t neglected <HI>Plant</HI> and <HI>Vapour,</HI> are at His Di&s;po&s;e. No wonder then that Bildad demanded as he did, Job 25. 3. <HI>Is there any number of his armies?</HI></P>
<P>GOD is the ab&s;olute Monarch of the Univer&s;e, the Leader and Commander of the Creatures; they all
<PB N="10" REF="003860_0012_10020617330A1210">
obey the Voice of his Word, and ob&s;erve and ful|fil the Commands and Orders which he gives forth from his exalted Throne.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lord is eminently a Man of War, as</HI> He di&s;po&s;es Men's Hearts to engage in Wars &amp; <HI>Battles.</HI></P>
<P>The Hearts of all Men are in the Hands of GOD; He turns them which way &s;o ever He plea&s;es, and over rules them, to &s;erve His great Ends and Purpo&s;es, his Glory &amp; De&s;igns in the World, whe|ther they be the Hearts of His Friends, or of His Enemies. But GOD's Hand is more e&s;pecially &s;een, or his Permi&s;&s;ion granted, in the Provocations to Wars and Battles among Men. When their Minds are taken off from Peace and Amity, and they are di&s;pos'd to Contend in a Field of Blood, and have their Cabinet Councels, to contrive, pre|pare and execute the Stratagems of War.</P>
<P>Thus it was from the LORD JEHOVAH, that <HI>Pha|raoh's Heart was &s;o hardned again&s;t</HI> GOD and His People, as to go forth to Battle again&s;t them; but it was becau&s;e GOD had purpos'd to de&s;troy him and his <HI>gallant</HI> Armies.&mdash;And it was of GOD that Rehoboam was &s;o invariably &s;et to hearken to the Councel of his young and giddy Cavaliers, and to turn a deaf ear to the Sage Advice of his venera|ble and experienc'd Councellors; that GOD might rend ten Tribes from him, that would ri&s;e up in Arms again&s;t Him.&mdash;It was al&s;o of GOD, that Ahab, was &s;o immoveably fixed, to go to War a|gain&s;t Ramoth-Gilead, that he might be wounded and fall in the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>GOD as the Governour of the World, has great and &s;ecret De&s;igns to carry on in the Earth; and He is pleas'd often to do it, in the Bloody &s;cenes
<PB N="11" REF="003860_0013_1002658F0FD665C8">
of War. When a People have &s;in'd again&s;t Him and provoked Him by their Inventions; He rai&s;es up another Nation as a Rod of His Anger to puni&s;h them; and in their turn He takes the Rod &amp; burns it in the &s;ame flames. Agreeably we read of GOD's influence in matters of War in His Word, I Chron. 5 22 <HI>And there fell down many &s;lain, becau&s;e the war was of GOD.</HI> And again, Jer. 25. 39 <HI>Ye &s;hall not be unpuni&s;hed: for I will call for a &s;word, &s;aith the LORD of ho&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>So that upon this account al&s;o, and from the in|fluence which Almighty GOD has in di&s;po&s;ing Men; Nations or particular Per&s;ons to Wars and Battles, He may eminently be called a Man of War; <HI>as well as the GOD of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Lord is eminently a Man of War, as</HI> He mu&s;ters the Forces together, and leads them as their General into the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>GOD not only di&s;po&s;es Mens Minds to Wars and Contentions, but <HI>mu&s;ters</HI> them together for the Field of Battle: He rai&s;es their Forces and collects their numerous Armies <HI>principal</HI> and <HI>auxi|liary.</HI> I&s;ai. 13. 4. <HI>The Lord of ho&s;ts mu&s;tereth the Ho&s;t of the Battle.</HI></P>
<P>Men indeed act freely and according to their Minds and Coun&s;els in the&s;e Affairs; nor is there any nece&s;&s;ity laid upon them by the divine Will and Purpo&s;es; yet, the Finger of GOD mu&s;t be ac|knowleged in &s;o great an Event as this. No Army could be rais'd, no Regiments or Battalions drawn up in the Seat of Action, if He that was not the LORD General of the Ho&s;ts of the Univer&s;e did not call for them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003860_0014_10026592805C2DA8">
If we look into the <HI>Book of the Wars of the Lord,</HI> and con&s;ider the Story of the Engagements of his ancient People, we may ea&s;ily &s;ee a &s;pecial Hand of Divine Providence therein, and that in the very beginnings of the War; as rai&s;ing Forces, mu&s;tering Armies, giving Orders &amp;c. I&s;ai. 5. 26. <HI>And he will lift up an En&s;ign to the Nations from far, and will hi&s;s unto them from the end of the Earth; and behold they &s;hall come with &s;peed &s;wiftly.</HI> If Almighty GOD did but give an <HI>Hi&s;s</HI> or a <HI>Nod,</HI> or the lea&s;t intimation of His Sovereign Mind in this ca&s;e, the Cry would immediately be, <HI>to Arms, to Arms.</HI> If GOD does but lift up His <HI>En&s;ign</HI> and <HI>Standard,</HI> va&s;t and numerous Armies, a fierce and formidable Ho&s;t &s;hall draw near to his Banner, ready to hear the words of Command, and to ex|ecute His Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>That was ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd a proud and arrogant Speech in <HI>Pompey,</HI> when one of his Officers told him they wanted Men: Let me, &s;ays he, but &s;tamp my foot on the Ground of Italy, then I &s;hall have Men eno', Hor&s;emen and Foot-men from every Corner; and when he attempted it, he was &s;hame|fully di&s;appointed. But not &s;o with the LORD of Ho&s;ts and the GOD of Armies; let Him but li&s;p the Word, or &s;ignify His Sovereign Plea&s;ure; and to Him will the <HI>gathering</HI> of the People be, they will March with &s;peed, &s;wiftly to fight the LORD's Battles.&mdash;</P>
<P>But then GOD Almighty comes Him&s;elf as the GENERALISSIMO into the Field with his People. He not only mu&s;ters the Ho&s;t, but leads them forth, and &s;ets them in <HI>Battle Array.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes indeed He leads the Enemies of His People again&s;t them, to puni&s;h them for their
<PB N="13" REF="003860_0015_1002061C058D3BF0">
apo&s;tacies and rebellions again&s;t Him; but u&s;ually He is with His People as their Chief Commander, to lead them on to, and to direct and encourage them in, their Martial Actions and Enterprizes. This was the encouragement which the Prie&s;ts were directed to give GOD's People of old, when they were engaging in Battle, Deut. 20. 3, 4. <HI>Hear O I&s;rael, you approach this day to battle again&s;t your ene|mies: let not your hearts faint, fear not and do not tremble, neither he ye terrified becau&s;e of them:</HI> The rea&s;on follows, <HI>For the LORD your GOD is he that goeth with you, to fight for you again&s;t your enemies, to &s;ave you. i. e.</HI> He will be your GENERAL at the Head of your Armies to lead you on again&s;t your Ene|mies, and to make you victorious over them.</P>
<P>And how Gloriou&s;ly did He march before His People I&s;rael when he brought them out of the Hou&s;e of their Bondage? Was it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever have obtained &s;o many Victories as they did over &s;uch Pui&s;&s;ant Enemies, with their Chariots of Iron, if the LORD of Ho&s;ts had not been in their Front, and fought their Battles for them? And it is His Pre&s;ence and Influence that makes their Arms pro&s;perous. Zech. 10. 5. <HI>And they &s;hall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies as the mire of the &s;treets in the battel, and they &s;hall fight becau&s;e the LORD is with them, and the riders on hor&s;es &s;hall be confounded.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, according to the Military &s;tile, the LORD is al&s;o their LIEUTENANT-GENERAL; He is not only in the Front but in the Rear to &s;ecure and defend them. I&s;a. 52. 12. <HI>For the LORD will go before you: and the GOD of I&s;rael will be your Rere|ward.</HI> And thus He was in the Pillar of Cloud betwixt the Egyptians and I&s;raelites, when Pha|raoh and his ho&s;t, were about to attack them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003860_0016_10020604A18855D8">
Surely that Army that has Almighty GOD both in the Front and Rear, mu&s;t be call'd <HI>Invincible;</HI> they mu&s;t needs be &s;afe, pro&s;per and prevail.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The LORD is eminently a Man of War, as</HI> He In&s;tructs the People in the Art and My&s;tery of War, and endows them with Martial Skill and Valour.</P>
<P>The LORD <HI>in&s;tructs</HI> the People in the <HI>Art of War.</HI> He led them fir&s;t into the di&s;covery of the Rules and Methods of it; He enables them to apply them and to improve upon them: and when any are excellently well skill'd therein, in all their Military Exerci&s;es, Po&s;tures, Encampments, Engagements, &amp;c. they are Taught &amp; In&s;tructed by the LORD. P&s;al. 144. I. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD my &s;trength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</HI></P>
<P>And then GOD directs in every De&s;ign, and &s;ug|ge&s;ts &s;uch <HI>politic Coun&s;els,</HI> that the mo&s;t expert Warriors could not invent or guard again&s;t. Other Generals have their Coun&s;els of War upon Emer|gencies, to advi&s;e, encourage and &s;trengthen one another: But the LORD of Ho&s;ts the Wonderful Coun&s;ellor, has all Wi&s;dom and Coun&s;el in Him|&s;elf, and Communicates of them to all that are un|der Him.&mdash;The LORD accounts it his Glory, that He teaches the Plowman, to open and break the clods of the Earth, and to Sow his Seed, &amp;c. But how much greater is his Glory to give Wi&s;dom and Skill to Order and lead forth Armies, for their Safety, Defence and Victory? This cometh from the GOD of Armies, who is <HI>wonderful in Coun&s;el, and excellent in Working.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, it is the LORD al&s;o that takes away Coun&s;el, and defeats the De&s;igns again&s;t his

People; &s;o he turned the Coun&s;el of crafty Achito|phel into folli&s;hne&s;s. GOD be&s;otts them in their Con&s;ultations, mingles a perver&s;e deceitful Spirit a|mong Men, and &s;catters darkne&s;s in their paths, &s;o that their Coun&s;els are turned up&s;ide down, and they are &s;nared in the work of their own hands. I&s;a. 19. 11. <HI>Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the coun&s;el of the wi&s;e coun&s;ellors of Pharoah is become bruiti&s;h. The princes of Noph are deceived, they have al&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Egypt:</HI> And we &s;ee the fatal i&s;&s;ue of it in the ca&s;e that has been mentioned.</P>
<P>But then as the LORD gives Wi&s;dom and Coun|&s;el, &s;o He gives <HI>Courage and Prowe&s;s</HI> in War. Then are Some mighty Men of Valour; they face the greate&s;t Dangers, and out-brave the King of Ter|rors him&s;elf, marching in his mo&s;t frightful Forms again&s;t them. When the Spirit of the LORD came upon Samp&s;on, Gideon and others, what valiant Soldiers were they, and how great their exploits? They &s;ubdued Kingdoms, &s;topped the Mouths of Lions, out of Weakne&s;s were made Strong, waxed valiant in Fight, and turn'd to flight the Armies of the Aliens. Were there ever more brave and un|daunted Spirits, more re&s;olute, heroic and magna|nimous Warriours? Verily there is no Valour like That of GOD's infu&s;ing.</P>
<P>But then as the LORD gives a Spirit of Courage and Pui&s;&s;ance, &s;o <HI>He takes it away:</HI> Then the &s;toute&s;t Champions become the greate&s;t Cowards, and their Hearts melt and &s;ink within them, &s;o that they flee even before a Leaf &s;haken with the Wind, and are affrighted at their own &s;hadows. I&s;ai. 19. 16. <HI>In that day &s;hall Egypt be like unto Women; and it &s;hall be afraid and fear, becau&s;e of the &s;haking of the hand of the Lord of ho&s;ts which he &s;haketh over it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003860_0018_1002659A569F7548">
So that upon this account al&s;o the LORD may be called <HI>a Man of War,</HI> as He in&s;tructs the People in the Art and My&s;tery of it, directs their Coun&s;els, and endows them with Martial Skill and Valour; &s;o that they are expert in War, and mighty in Battle.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The LORD is eminently a Man of War, as</HI> He hath the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;als of all the Weapons in the Day of Battle.</P>
<P>Altho' He endows Men with Wi&s;dom &amp; Cun|ning, to make the In&s;truments of War, and Skill and Courage to u&s;e the Martial Weapons; yet He re&s;erves to Him&s;elf the Prerogative to di&s;po&s;e of them as to the Event. All the <HI>Weapons</HI> u&s;ed by the Sons of War, and the mo&s;t formidable preparations of the &s;tronge&s;t Armado, &s;hall be of u&s;e only &s;o far as the Lord plea&s;eth. Agreable to this is that pro|mi&s;e which God made to his ancient People, I&s;ai. 54. 17. <HI>No weapon that is formed again&s;t thee &s;hall pro&s;per.</HI> i. e. If any be pointed at thee, tho' never &s;o &s;kilfully managed, it &s;hall not harm thee: It &s;hall mi&s;s the Mark, fall out of the Hand of your Ene|mies, or recoil upon them to their own Wounding and Hurt.</P>

<P>Thus we have &s;ometimes heard, that an Army has been mi&s;erably defeated, that was admirably

well equip'd, and prepar'd with Martial Engines and Weapons of War; and tho' they &s;til'd them|&s;elves Invincible; Their Arms and Artillery, their Gallies and Fire Ships, their floating Ca&s;tles and Batteries, did not an&s;wer their name. GOD di&s;|appointed them; they were a&s;hamed and con|founded, defeated &amp; &s;cattered. This is the LORD's doings and &s;hould be marvellous in our eyes! Who is like unto the LORD among the Gods, who is like unto Him? Fearful in Prai&s;es, working Wonders. He Governs the&s;e Events without controul. <HI>He breaks the bow in pieces, cuts the &s;pears in &s;under, burns the chariots in the fire; and will have all the Armies know that He is GOD:</HI> That the Lives of all are in His Hand; and that the Wea|pons form'd again&s;t them &s;hall pro&s;per or be de|feated, according to His Sovereign Purpo&s;es and Will.</P>
<P>The Bow drawn at a venture, and the Gun di&s;|charg'd without &s;ight, are directed by the Provi|dence of GOD. So that in Life and Death none may &s;ay, a Chance has happen'd to them.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The LORD is eminently a Man of War, as</HI> He cau&s;es it to Continue or Cea&s;e whenever He plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus Sovereign is Almighty GOD in the manage|ment of the grand Affairs of War.</P>
<P><HI>The Sword &s;hall not be drawn till He gives the the Word of Command;</HI> and when it is un&s;heath'd it &s;hall not be return'd into it's Scab-board till He requires it.

<P>We are apt to look at Men altogether in the continuance of a War; now though it be true that Their haughty &s;pirit, and mutual Provocations, are the Secondary cau&s;es both of the beginning and continuance of War, yet there is an over-ruling Providence, di&s;po&s;ing and ordering the&s;e things, for wi&s;e and good, though it may be, &s;ecret ends and purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>As the War begins in the day that GOD has fixed, &s;o it concludes at the time that He has ap|pointed; and till that happy Period arrives, all <HI>Negotiations for Peace,</HI> and the Accommodation of differences among the Nations will be fruitle&s;s and ineffectual. But when GOD &s;ays, it is enough; then the Sword &s;hall be &s;heath'd again, and the de|&s;troying Angel return to render an account of the &s;lain, unto the LORD of Life and Glory.</P>
<P>Here then we may al&s;o further ob&s;erve, that God <HI>puts a period to War,</HI> or &s;ometimes <HI>marvellou&s;ly prevents it,</HI> as He at other Times calls into the Field

<P>We have a &s;urprizing In&s;tance of GOD's Power and Influence in preventing of War and Blood-&s;hed in the ca&s;e of Rehoboam, recorded I <HI>King.</HI> 12. 21. We have not the like in all the Book of God; nei|ther is there any thing to be compar'd unto it be|fore or &s;ince in the Earth.</P>
<P>King Rehoboam was greatly incen&s;ed again&s;t the Tribes that fell off from him: He was in as great a Rage and Ferment as we may &s;uppo&s;e a Furio&s;o to be rais'd into; and the Flame was blown up to the Heighth by the heady &amp; unexperienc'd Courtiers a|bout him.

<P>GOD by His Omnipotent Arm da&s;hes the mo&s;t daring De&s;igns in pieces. He quelleth the proud Spirits of the mo&s;t furious Nimrods, and reduces the foaming Billows of Wars and Tumults, into the mo&s;t perfect and delightful Calm and Tran|quility. Once more,</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The LORD is eminently a Man of War,</HI> as He over-rules the great Events of it, and gives Succe&s;s and Victory to whom&s;oever He plea&s;es.</P>
<P>A Hor&s;e is a vain thing for &s;afety; and &s;o is a Coat of Mail, or the keene&s;t Armour: Tho' Men be never &s;o well equip'd and prepar'd for the Bat|tle, <HI>Salvation is of the Lord.</HI> How frequently are Men deceiv'd and mi&s;taken in their Hopes &amp; Con|jectures, as to the Succe&s;s of this and the other Battle and Engagement, whil&s;t they don't con&s;ider the over-ruling Hand of GOD, and His Sovereignty

<P>That's a Maxim of Wi&s;dom and Truth. Eccl. 9. 11. <HI>The race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong.</HI> And if the LORD be on their &s;ide, one &s;hall cha&s;e a thou&s;and, and two put ten thou&s;and to flight.

<P>GOD determines that &s;uch &s;hall go up, and be &s;lain in &s;uch an high place of the Field; or fall in &s;uch a skirmi&s;h and attack: and of others He de|&s;igns to cover their Heads in the day of Battle, that not an Hair of them &s;hall fall to the ground; He gives them their Life for a Prey.</P>
<P>And &s;o as to Victory in re&s;pect of the Action of the main Body, <HI>That</HI> al&s;o is ordered of the LORD.

<P>Thus HE that formed all Things, and ruleth over all; He that Thunders in the Clouds, that holds the Winds in his Fi&s;t, and the Ocean in the Hol|low of his Hand, that mea&s;ures the Earth with a

<P>As He is the Almighty Maker of Heaven and Earth; and the Sovereign Ruler and Di&s;po&s;er of all things in His Holy Providence; particularly as He has the Government of Wars and Fightings a|mong the Nations; in the management of which He di&s;covers His Infinite Wi&s;dom, irre&s;i&s;tible Power, Un&s;potted Holine&s;s, Boundle&s;s Goodne&s;s, Perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the other Glorious Perfections of the Divine Nature.</P>

<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, and for &s;ome rea&s;ons, it is both Lawful and a Duty, to take up Arms and go forth to War; and it is nece&s;&s;ary for Men to &s;tudy the Military Act and to acquire a Martial Genius and Spirit, that they may either turn the Battle to the Gate, and rai&s;e the Siege; or Invade a Foreign E|nemy, and Couragiou&s;ly encamp again&s;t them. It

is Lawful to take up Arms in the Defence of our Lives and E&s;tates, to guard our Religious and Civil Liberties, and to take ju&s;t Revenges on tho&s;e that have cruelly Slain our Neighbours and carried into Captivity our Friends.

As the E&s;tate of Marriage is much honour'd, in that CHRIST is pleas'd to expre&s;s that great My|&s;tery of the Go&s;pel, the ble&s;&s;ed Union betwixt Him|&s;elf &amp; His Church by it: So the Calling of a Sol|dier or Warrior is much honoured by this, that GOD Him&s;elf is &s;tiled a Man of War, and &s;o often takes upon Him the Title of the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>God of Armies.</HI></P>
<P>We have but now &s;aid, that the LORD of Ho&s;ts is the King of Glory; and &s;urely &s;ome of His <HI>Glory will &s;hine and re&s;t upon tho&s;e Soldiers,</HI> that &s;erve un|der Him, and are like unto Him. The Roman's honour'd a Soldier much, and the Latin calls a Sol|dier and a Knight by the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>It was an Ob&s;ervation of the Learned Dr. COTTON MATHER, that it was made an Act among the Warlike Spartans, that no Man &s;hould have an Epitaph, or &s;o much as his Name written upon his Grave, if he had not been a Soldier; that &s;ome of the chief Dignitary Titles now in the World had a Military Ri&s;e; and that the Soldiers in King David and King Solomon's Times, were reckoned the <HI>Worthies</HI> of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>And indeed, many Monuments in Scripture are rais'd to their Honour that were remarkable for their Martial Skill, Valour and Exploits; their Names are mentioned with Characters of Prai&s;e, they are con&s;ecrated to Po&s;terity, and the &s;mell thereof is fragrant as the precious Ointment; and when they Dye in the Bed of Honour, their Names are had in Everla&s;ting Remembrance.</P>

In our Context after GOD is Magnify'd as triumphing gloriou&s;ly over His and His People's Enemies; He is, <HI>ver.</HI> II. &s;aid to be, <HI>Glorious in Ho|line&s;s.</HI> It is very remarkable that GOD's Holine&s;s in the Sacred Oracles is frequently joyned with His Title of the LORD of Ho&s;ts. I&s;a. 47. 4. <HI>As for our Redeemer, the LORD of Ho&s;ts is his Name, the holy One of I&s;rael.</HI> So when the Cherubims and Sera|phims, are Magnifying His Glory, in their exalted and uncea&s;ing Re&s;pon&s;es, they cry out, as I&s;a. 6. 3. <HI>Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Ho&s;ts.</HI> And becau&s;e the <HI>Great General is Holy, &s;o &s;hould all His Ho&s;ts, His</HI> Officers and Soldiers <HI>be.</HI></P>
<P>It has been the cu&s;tom of Soldiers to endeavour to imitate their General in any thing; yea in their very Imperfections. ALEXANDER's Soldiers counted it a graceful Mein to hold their Heads on one &s;ide, becau&s;e Alexander their General did &s;o. But with an <HI>how much more,</HI> &s;hould Chri&s;tian Soldiers, en|deavour to be like the LORD of Ho&s;ts, in that which is his greate&s;t Excellency and Glory; and which will ca&s;t a peculiar Lu&s;tre &amp; Glory on them. Such will find, that Holine&s;s and Valour are not only con&s;i&s;tent with one another, but &s;ub&s;ervient to each other, even in Men of Arms. It is a dete&s;ta|ble Maxim of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> that Religion makes Men Cowards. The mo&s;t Valiant Soldiers in the Earth, have been mo&s;t eminent for their Religion &amp; Ver|tue. It is true to a Proverb, Prov. 28. I. <HI>The Wicked fleeth when no Man pur&s;ueth; but the Righ|teous are hold as a Lion.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ays the ingenuous SYMMES, that the Sun never &s;hone on three braver Warriors, than Abraham, Jo&s;hua, and David; and yet who more renowned for the Power of Godline&s;s than the&s;e Worthies? Cornelius a Roman Captain was
<PB N="27" REF="003860_0029_100206356E858BC0">
a devout Man, and one that feared GOD with all his Hou&s;e; and he had a devout Soldier which waited on him continually, <HI>Act.</HI> 10. 2, 7.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH tells us of a Theban Band of Soldiers, which they call'd the holy Band, in which there was more Confidence put than in any, becau&s;e they pro&s;pered above others. The holy GOD who walks in the mid&s;t of the Ho&s;ts and Armies, re|quires Holine&s;s in them, Deut. 23. 9, 14. <HI>When the Ho&s;t goeth forth again&s;t thine Enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing: For the Lord thy God walk|eth in the mid&s;t of the Camp; therefore &s;hall thy Camp be holy; that he &s;ee no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.</HI> This is that <HI>Divine Wi&s;dom,</HI> of which Eccle&s;ia&s;tes &s;peaks, <HI>that is better than Wea|pons of War.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>We &s;ee hence where</HI> Soldiers mu&s;t repair for, and to whom they mu&s;t give the Glory of their Military Skill, Valour &amp; Succe&s;s in Wars. <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>To the GOD of Armies,</HI> who is eminently a Man of War.</P>
<P>We have &s;een &s;omething intended in this Cha|racter, and find that a Martial Skill and Genius, Spirit and Courage, Conduct and Stratagems in War, do all come down from the Father of Lights, who is the giver of every good and perfect Gift.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e then that profe&s;s them&s;elves Soldiers, &s;hould give <HI>Thanks</HI> to Him, for the di&s;covery of the Military Science, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to fur|ni&s;h Men with the methods of Safety and Defence again&s;t an Invading Enemy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And they &s;hould carefully <HI>Study,</HI> and exerci&s;e them&s;elves in all the parts of it; that they may gain as thorough and compleat a knowledge there|in

as po&s;&s;ibly they can, and that hereby they may make full proof of their Armour.&mdash;</P>
<P>And in the <HI>U&s;e of Means,</HI> they &s;hould have their Eye and <HI>Prayer</HI> lifted up to the LORD of Ho&s;ts, that He would &s;ucceed their Studies &amp; Exerci&s;es; that He would teach their Hands to War, and their Fin|gers to Fight, and make them Men of valour and Men of renown in their day, becau&s;e of their pro|flciency, expertne&s;s and prowe&s;s therein.&mdash;</P>
<P>And if any do excel in this Martial Skill, and are very dexterous &amp; active in their Military Exerci&s;es; or are fired with a magnanimous Spirit and Pui&s;|&s;ance; and have been Succe&s;sful and Victorious in a day of Battle: they &s;hould <HI>Religiou&s;ly Sacri|fice the Prai&s;e of all to GOD,</HI> for to Him does it ap|pertain. He that teaches the lowe&s;t Husband man his Art, teaches the greate&s;t General his Skill; and it is by His Ble&s;&s;ing they are both &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>To rob GOD of this Glory, is very provoking to Him; the King of A&s;&s;yria is threatned with De|&s;truction for it. I&s;a. 10. 12, 13. <HI>I will puni&s;h the fruit of the &s;tout heart of the king of A&s;&s;yria, and the glory of his high looks. For he &s;aith, By the &s;trength of my hand I have done it, and by my wi&s;dom; and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, Let not the <HI>&s;trong Man glory in his &s;trength,</HI> nor the <HI>skilful glory in his wi&s;dom,</HI> nor the <HI>&s;tout-hearted glory in their fortitude:</HI> But let Him that glorieth, <HI>Glory in the LORD alone.</HI> But,</P>

greate&s;t and mo&s;t terrible Judgments wherewith He has been won't to puni&s;h a rebellious People.</P>
<P>So amazing was it in the apprehen&s;ion of David, tho' a man of War, and mo&s;t expert and valiant in it, that he cho&s;e rather the Pe&s;tilence &s;hould break in upon his People, than their bloody Ene|mies; tho' they were to be de&s;troyed by them but for three Months, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24. 13, 14. When GOD reckons up his four Cardinal Judgments, we find War or a devouring Sword marching in the Front, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14. 21. And it is a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Calamity, when GOD furbi&s;hes a Sword and gives it a Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;aying, <HI>Sword, go thro' the Land, cut off, and &s;pare not.</HI></P>
<P>Should I enter upon a Detail of the Mi&s;eries of it, <HI>where</HI> &s;hould I begin, and <HI>when</HI> &s;hould I end. I would turn you to the Book of the <HI>Lamentations</HI> of Jeremiah; there you have the <HI>Bloody Scene</HI> opened, and &s;ome of the Horrors of it de&s;crib'd, by one who both &s;aw and felt no &s;mall part of it: And who can read the tragical Story, without joining with the weeping Prophet in his Moans, and &s;ay, <HI>Mine Eye! mine Eye! runneth down &amp;c.</HI> And if the bare de&s;cription of the direful Cala|mities of War, are &s;o affecting and grievous, what are the Evils them&s;elves?&mdash;</P>
<P>This by the way &s;hould excite our Pity &amp; Com|pa&s;&s;ion, and engage our Prayers, for the People that are at this Day, more e&s;pecially in EUROPE, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the Calamities of War, Depredati|ons and Blood&s;hed.
