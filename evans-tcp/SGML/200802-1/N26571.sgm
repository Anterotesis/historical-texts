<HEAD>THE INDIANS. A TALE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>In pity come, and ea&s;e my grief,</L>
<L>Bring my di&s;temper'd &s;oul relief.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MARANO, amiable in her &s;orrow, &s;at alone by a &s;helving rock. She &s;ought in &s;oli|tude to indulge the angui&s;h of her &s;oul. She leaned pen&s;ive on her arm. Her tre&s;&s;es flowed carele&s;s to the gale. The blooming beauty of her complexion was flu&s;hed with weeping. Her eyes were full of tender anxiety. And her bo&s;om heaved with repeated &s;ighs.</P>
<P>'When will he return?' &s;he &s;aid,
<Q>my beloved Oneyo! the hu&s;band of my affections! How I long to behold him! ye waves of Ontario convey him to his native &s;hore; re&s;tore him to his friends; re&s;tore him to my tender embrace. O when &s;hall I behold him? when will the &s;wift canoe come bounding over the lake, and waft the hero to his glad&s;ome i&s;le! Yes, thou happy i&s;le! thy rocks, thy re&s;ounding glades, and thy fore&s;ts &s;hall then rejoice. Gladne&s;s &s;hall then be in the village. The Elders &s;hall come forth to receive him. The fe&s;tival &s;hall be prepared.
<PB N="10" REF="035333_0009_10022EA1D5C46EF8">
Ah me! peradventure he hath peri&s;hed! Or now expires in &s;ome bloody field! impetuous in his valour, and eager in the ardour of youth, perchance he ru&s;hes on the foe and falls!</Q>
While Marano thus indulged her inquietude, the venera|ble Ononthio was drawing nigh to con&s;ole her. He had perceived the unea&s;ine&s;s of her &s;oul, and had followed her from the village. He was the father of Oneyo, one of the Elders of the nation, revered for his wi&s;dom, and beloved for his hu|manity. He loved Marano with the affection of a father. 'Be comforted,' he &s;aid,
<Q>give not thy &s;oul to de&s;pair. The great &s;pirit, who rides in the whirlwind, and &s;peaks from the pa&s;&s;ing thunder, will protect thee. But to merit his favour, be re&s;igned to his will. It is impious to anticipate mi&s;ery, and render our&s;elves unhappy before we are actually afflicted. Be comforted. Oneyo may &s;oon return loaded with the &s;poils of the Briton, and extolled by the gallant warriors of France.</Q></P>
<P>'To &s;ee my hu&s;band return in &s;afety,' &s;he re|plied,
<Q>is the &s;um of my de&s;ires. To &s;ee him loaded with the &s;poils of the Briton will be no ad|dition to my joy.</Q>
The Indian &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed. 'Have you forgotten,' &s;he continued,
<Q>that I my|&s;elf am a Briton that I was carried violently from my father's hou&s;e, when the Outagami rav|aged our land, and carried terror to the gates of Albany? My parents peri&s;hed. I was yet a child; but I remember the bloody carnage. My brother of riper years, was re&s;cued; but I
<PB N="11" REF="035333_0010_10022EA42348DA28">
became the prey of their fury. Since that time, many years are elap&s;ed; yet at the name of Briton my bo&s;om glows with peculiar tran&s;port.</Q></P>
<P>'I fondly imagined,' an&s;wered the Indian,
<Q>that you loved us. We named you after the manner of our tribe. But your affections are e&s;tranged, and you langui&s;h for the land of your fathers. I called you my daughter&mdash;but, Marano you would leave me.</Q>
Uttering the&s;e words, he looked tenderly upon her.
<Q>You would leave me,</Q>
he repeated, and a tear ro&s;e in his eye. Marano was affected. She cla&s;ped his hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her ro&s;y lips.
<Q>No, I will never leave thee. My heart is thine, and my beloved Oneyo's. I revere thee. Can I forget thy compa&s;&s;ion? Can I forget the dreadful day when the Outagami, in an a&s;&s;embly of their nation, decreed me a &s;a|crifice to their god Are&s;koui. You was pre&s;ent on an emba&s;&s;y from your people. Oneyo in the bloom of years accompanied his father. He was be&s;ide you. He &s;ighed, when he beheld me weeping. Alas! I was feeble, friendle&s;s, and be&s;et with &s;oes. Oneyo intreated you to relieve me. Your own heart was affected; you inter|po&s;ed in my behalf; you redeemed me, and cal|led me your's. Oneyo ha&s;ted to my deliverance; he loo&s;ened my &s;etters, and cla&s;ped me to his brea&s;t. Our affection grew with our years. You beheld it with kind indulgence, and ratified our wi&s;hes with your con&s;ent. I have heard of European refinements, of co&s;tly raiment, and lofty palaces; yet to me the &s;implicity of the&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="035333_0011_10022EA6703AB5D0">
rocks and fore&s;ts &s;eem far more delightful. But if Oneyo returns not, I am undone. Many moons have ari&s;en &s;ince. With the flower of our tribe, he departed. The matrons are alrea|dy wailing for their &s;ons.&mdash;Oneyo, alas! is im|petuous, and if he has fallen, grief will &s;ubdue thee; I know the tenderne&s;s of thine affection; it will pull thee down to the grave. Who then will be my friend? Among a &s;trange people, I have no father to protect me, no brother to coun&s;el or give me aid.</Q></P>
<P>Ononthio was about to reply, when an Indian from the village acco&s;ted them. He told them, with a &s;orrowful a&s;pect, that the hopes of their tribe were bla&s;ted, for that &s;ome Indians of a neigh|bouring nation, having returned from Canada, brought certain intelligence of the total overthrow of their friends; that they had, with difficulty, e&s;caped; that Oneyo was &s;een fierce and intrepid in the heat of the battle; that he was &s;urrounded by the foe, and mu&s;t have fallen a victim to their fury.</P>
<P>Marano was overwhelmed. Ononthio heaved a &s;igh: but the haple&s;s condition of his daughter, and the de&s;ire of yielding her con&s;olation, &s;u&s;pend|ed and relieved his &s;orrow.
<Q>If my &s;on has fal|len,</Q>
he &s;aid,
<Q>he has fallen as became a warrior. His prai&s;e &s;hall be pre&s;erved by his kindred and de&s;cend to po&s;terity in the war &s;ong. His name &s;hall terrify the European, when the chieftains of future times, ru&s;hing fierce from their fore&s;ts, &s;hall &s;urround his habitation at midnight, and
<PB N="13" REF="035333_0012_10022EA80268FD38">
rai&s;e the yell of death in his ear. Oneyo &s;hall not die unrevenged.</Q>
'He &s;hall not,' interrupted the Indian.
<Q>The me&s;&s;ingers of our misfortune hovered around the walls of Quebec. They &s;ur|pri&s;ed a party of the foe, they have brought them captives to our I&s;land; the Elders of our nation are now a&s;&s;embled; they have doomed them a &s;acrifice to the memory of the dead; and defer their execution, only till your arrival.</Q>
'Alas!' &s;aid Marano,
<Q>the &s;acrafice of a captive will afford me &s;mall con&s;olation. Will the death of a foe re&s;tore life to my hu&s;band? or heal his gha&s;tly wounds? or reanimate his breathle&s;s bo&s;om? Leave me to my woe. Leave me to wail on the&s;e lonely mountains. Here I will not long be a &s;ojourner. I will away to my love. I will meet him beyond the de&s;erts, in &s;ome bli&s;sful valley, where no bloody foe &s;hall invade us. Leave me to my &s;orrow; for I will not live.</Q>
She intreated in vain. The Indian was urgent, and Ononthio &s;econded his &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>That nation of Indians, of which Oneyo was a leader, inhabited an I&s;land in the Lake Ontario. They were, therefore, no &s;ooner informed of the death of Oneyo, and of their brethren, than they abandoned them&s;elves to loud lamentations. The matrons with rent garments and dis&s;hevelled tre&s;|&s;es, ran forth into the fields, and filled the air with their wailing. They then crowded around the captives, whom, in the bitterne&s;s of their woe, they loaded with keen invectives. The Elders were a&s;&s;embled; the boiling caldron into which
<PB N="14" REF="035333_0013_10022EA99015BCA0">
the victims, after &s;uffering every &s;pecies of tor|ment, were to be precipitated, was &s;u&s;pended over a raging fire; the knives, tomahawks, and other implements of cruelty, were exhibited in dreadful array; and the pri&s;oners, loaded with heavy fet|ters, were conducted to the place of &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Though Marano was deeply afflicted, the &s;creams of the Indians, and the horrid prepara|tions of torture, drew her attention to the pri&s;on|ers. She regarded them with an eye of pity. Their leader, in the prime of youth, was comely, vigorous, and graceful. The &s;ullenne&s;s of un|daunted and indignant valour was portrayed by nature in his fearle&s;s a&s;pect. His eye, full of ar|dour and invincible firmne&s;s, &s;urveyed the prep|arations of death with indifference, and &s;hot defi|ance to the foe. His followers, though valiant, &s;eemed incapable of the &s;ame ob&s;tinate re&s;olution; their features betrayed &s;ymptoms of di&s;may; but turning to their leader, they were &s;truck with his un&s;haken boldne&s;s, they re&s;umed their native courage, and armed their minds with becoming fortitude. Marano &s;ighed. The &s;en&s;e of her own misfortune was for a moment &s;u&s;pended.
<Q>Per|adventure,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he in her &s;oul,
<Q>this valiant youth, like Oneyo, may be lamented. Some tender maiden, to whom his faith has been plight|ed, may now langui&s;h for his return. Some aged parent, who&s;e infirmities he relieved and &s;upported, may be &s;ighing, anxious for his &s;afety. Or &s;ome orphan &s;i&s;ter, helple&s;s and for&s;aken, like me, may, by his death, be made de&s;olate.</Q>
She
<PB N="15" REF="035333_0014_10022EACCFE949B8">
then reflected on her own condition, and on the variety of her misfortunes. Carried into captivity in her early years, &s;he was a &s;tranger to her peo|ple, and to her kindred. Her hu&s;band no longer exi&s;ted; and he, who had been to her as a father, overcome by age and calamity, was now declining into the grave. Yet alive to compa&s;&s;ion, &s;he was moved for the unhappy victims. She admired the magnanimity of their leader, and in regarding him, &s;he felt unu&s;ual emotions, and a pang that &s;he could not expre&s;s. He was of her nation! Could &s;he behold him peri&s;h, and not endeavour to &s;ave him? Could &s;he behold him tortured, and not &s;hed a tear for his &s;ufferings! Meantime one of the Elders of the nation made a &s;ignal to the multitude. Immediate &s;ilence en&s;ued. Then with a look of &s;tern &s;everity, he thus expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to the captive.
<Q>The caldron boils, the ax is &s;harpened. Be prepared for torture and painful death. The &s;pirit of the decea&s;ed is yet among us. He lingers on the mountains, or hovers amid the winds. He expects a &s;acrifice, and &s;hall not chide our delay. Have you a parent or friend? They &s;hall never behold you. Prepare for torture and painful death.</Q>
<Q>Inflict your tortures,</Q>
he replied,
<Q>my &s;oul contemns them. I have no parents to lament for Sydney. In Albany they were ma&s;&s;acred, ma&s;&s;acred by in|human Indians. I had a &s;i&s;ter&mdash;I lo&s;t her. She was carried into captivity, and became the vic|tim of your &s;avage &s;ury. Inflict your tortures; my &s;oul contemns them, but remember, the day of vengeance &s;hall overtake you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035333_0015_10022EAF191BDF28">Marano was a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;
<Q>Of Albany! reft of his parents by the &s;word, and of a &s;i&s;ter!</Q>
&mdash;Suf|fice it to &s;ay, he was her brother. Mutual was their amazement, their affection mutual. She fell on his throbbing brea&s;t. He received her into his arms. His &s;oul was &s;oftened. Marano for a time was &s;peechle&s;s. At length weeping and in broken accents&mdash;
<Q>And have I found thee! a brother to &s;olace and &s;upport me. Who will guide me through the weary wilderne&s;s of my &s;orrow! Who will be to me as a parent! I was de&s;olate and forlorn, my &s;oul langui&s;hed and was afflicted; but now I will endure with pa|tience.</Q>
Then turning to the a&s;toni&s;hed multi|tude,
<Q>He is my brother! Born of the &s;ame parents! If I have ever merited your favour, O &s;ave him from de&s;truction.</Q>
They were deep|ly afflicted. 'Be not di&s;mayed,' &s;aid Ononthio, he &s;pake with the con&s;ent of the Elders:
<Q>Be not di&s;mayed. The brother of Marano &s;hall be to us as Oneyo.</Q>
Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, with an air of dignity to the &s;tranger.
<Q>Young man, I have lo&s;t a &s;on, Marano a hu&s;band, and our na|tion, a gallant warrior. He was &s;lain by the people of your land, and we are de&s;irous of grat|ifying his &s;pirit, before it pa&s;&s;es the mountains, by offering a &s;acrifice to his memory. But you are the brother of Marano; by her interce&s;&s;ion we have changed our de&s;ign, and adopt you into our tribe. Be a brother to our people, and to me a &s;on. Supply the place of the dead; and as you po&s;&s;e&s;s his valour, and &s;teady boldne&s;s, may you
<PB N="17" REF="035333_0016_10022EB0A5AE5108">
inherit his renown.</Q>
So &s;aying, he pre&s;ented to him the calumet of peace, and a girdle of wampum.</P>
<P>Meantime the arrival of &s;ome canoes, filled with armed warriors, attracted the notice of the a&s;&s;em|bly. They were tran&s;ported with ec&s;tacy and &s;ur|pri&s;e, when they de&s;cried the en&s;ign of their nation, and recognized &s;ome of their brethren, whom they imagined &s;lain. The hopes of Marano were re|vived. She enquired eagerly for Oneyo.
<Q>He peri&s;hed,</Q>
an&s;wered an Indian. She grew pale, her voice faltered, faint and &s;peechle&s;s, &s;he fell back on the throbbing brea&s;t of Ononthio.
<Q>He peri&s;hed,</Q>
continued the Indian,
<Q>and with him the prime of our warriors. The armies of France and Britain were mar&s;halled beneath the walls of Quebec. Direful was the havoc of the battle. The earth trembled with the &s;hock of the on&s;et. The air was tortured with repeated peals. The commanders of both armies were &s;lain. The fall was glorious, for their &s;ouls were undaunted. Re&s;entment inflamed the combatants. Keen and ob&s;tinate was the encounter. Albion at length prevailed. Her &s;ons, like a rapid torrent, over|threw the ranks of their adver&s;aries. We coun|&s;elled Oneyo to retire. Raging again&s;t the foe, and performing feats of amazing valour, we &s;aw him environed beyond all hope of retreat. We &s;aw the impetuo&s;ity of a youthful warrior, who brandi&s;hed a bloody &s;word, ru&s;hing on to de&s;troy him. We ha&s;tened from the field of death. We tarried &s;ome time in the adjacent fore&s;ts, and ob|&s;erved the progre&s;s of the foe. The walls of our
<PB N="18" REF="035333_0017_10022EB32D8B2630">
allies were overthrown. The &s;word of Albion will pur&s;ue us; and our &s;hield, our gallant war|rior, our Oneyo is no more.</Q></P>
<P>This melancholy recital filled the audience with lamentation. But their &s;orrow was interrupted by the &s;udden a&s;toni&s;hment of the narrator. Ca&s;ting his eye accidentally on the Briton,
<Q>Seize him, tear him,</Q>
he exclaimed;
<Q>His was the lifted &s;word I beheld! It was he cleft the brea&s;t of our chieftain! It was he that de&s;troyed him.</Q></P>
<P>The re&s;entment of the a&s;&s;embly was again in|flamed. 'I am innocent of his blood,' &s;aid the captive. But his declaration, and the entreaties of Ononthio in his behalf, were lo&s;t in furious &s;creams and invectives. They dragged him again to the place of &s;acrifice. Marano, di&s;tracted with con|tending woes, 'Spare him, &s;pare him!' exclaimed, 'He is my brother!' Fixing her eyes on him with a look of exqui&s;ite angui&s;h,
<Q>who&s;e hands are red with the blood of my hu&s;band! And was there none but thee to de&s;troy him?</Q>
'Tear him,' ex|claimed the multitude. Marano cla&s;ped him to her bo&s;om, and turning to the outrageous and me|nacing, with a wild and frantic demeanour,
<Q>Bloody, bloody, though he be, I will defend him, or per|i&s;h! Let the &s;ame javelin transfix us both! Smite and our kindred gore &s;hall be mingled.</Q>
The tran&s;cendent greatne&s;s of her calamity, who had lo&s;t a hu&s;band by the hand of a brother, and the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s energy of her features, expre&s;&s;ive of woe, tenderne&s;s and de&s;pair, awed the violence of the A&s;&s;embly, and di&s;po&s;ed them to pity. Onor|thio
<PB N="19" REF="035333_0018_10022EB577CBD810">
took advantage of the change. He waved his hand with parental love and authority. His hoary locks gave dignity to his ge&s;tures. The u&s;ual benignity of his countenance was &s;oftened with &s;orrow. He &s;poke the language of his &s;oul, and was eloquent; &s;poke the language of feeling, and was per&s;ua&s;ive. They li&s;tened to him with profound veneration, were moved, and deferred the &s;acrifice. He then comforted Marano, and con|veyed the captives to a place of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>When they were apart from the multitude, 'Tell me,' &s;aid he to the Briton,
<Q>are you guilt|le&s;s of the death of my &s;on!</Q>
'I know not,' he replied; for he had re&s;umed the pride of indig|nant courage,
<Q>I know not whom I have &s;lain. I drew my &s;word again&s;t the foes of my country, and I am not an&s;werable for the blood I have &s;pilt.</Q>
'Young man;' &s;aid Ononthio, full of &s;olici|tude and parental tenderne&s;s,
<Q>O reflect on a fa|ther's feelings. I had an only &s;on. He was val|iant. He was the prop and &s;olace of my old age; if he has gone down to darkne&s;s and the grave, I have no longer any joy in exi&s;tence. But, if he lives, and lives by thy clemency, the prayers of an old man &s;hall implore ble&s;&s;ings up|on thee, and the great &s;pirit &s;hall reward thee?</Q>
While he was yet &s;peaking, a tear ro&s;e in his eye, his voice faltered, he &s;ighed&mdash;
<Q>O tell me if my &s;on &s;urvives.</Q></P>
<P>'I &s;lew him not,' he replied.
<Q>In the heat of the encounter, a gallant Indian a&s;&s;ailed me. He was tired and exhau&s;ted&punc; I di&s;armed him; and my
<PB N="20" REF="035333_0019_10022EB7C7E4DFC0">
&s;word was lifted again&s;t his life.</Q>
'Briton,' &s;aid he with a re&s;olute tone,
<Q>think not that death di&s;|mays me. I have braved perils and the &s;word. I am not a &s;uppliant for my&s;elf. I have an aged parent, who&s;e life depends upon mine; the wife of my bo&s;om is a &s;tranger among my people, and I alone can protect her.</Q>
'Generous youth,' I replied,
<Q>go, comfort and protect thy friends. I &s;ent him forthwith from the field. I never en|quired into his condition; for in pre&s;erving him I obeyed the dictates of my heart.</Q>
Marano and Ononthio were overjoyed. But reflecting that ma|ny days had elap&s;ed &s;ince the di&s;comfiture of their allies, and that hitherto they had received no in|telligence of Oneyo, their joy &s;uffered abatement.</P>
<P>Meantime Ononthio coun&s;elled his daughter to conduct the &s;trangers to a di&s;tant retreat, and pre|&s;erve him there, till, by his influence and authority, he had appea&s;ed the violence of his brethren.</P>
<P>It was already night. The Indians were di&s;|per&s;ed to their hamlets, the &s;ky was calm and un|clouded. The full-orbed moon, in &s;erene and &s;ol|emn maje&s;ty, aro&s;e in the ea&s;t. Her beams were reflected in a blaze of &s;ilver radiance from the &s;mooth and untroubled bo&s;om of the lake. The grey hills and awful fore&s;ts were &s;olitary and &s;i|lent. No noi&s;e was heard, &s;ave the wailing of mat|rons, who lamented the untimely death of their &s;ons. Marano, with the captives, i&s;&s;uing unper|ceived from the village, pur&s;ued their way along the &s;ilent &s;hore, till they arrived at a narrow un|frequented rece&s;s. It was open to the lake, bound|ed
<PB N="21" REF="035333_0020_10022EB956C96F60">
on either &s;ide by &s;helving precipices, arrayed with living verdure, and parted by a winding riv|ulet. A venerable oak over&s;hadowed the foun|tain, and rendered the &s;cene more &s;olemn. The other captives were overcome with fatigue, and finding &s;ome withered leaves in an adjoining cav|ern, they indulged them&s;elves in repo&s;e. Marano conver&s;ed long with her brother; &s;he poured out her &s;oul in her &s;ympathi&s;ing bo&s;om; &s;he was com|forted and relieved. While &s;he leaned on his brea&s;t, while his arm was folded gently around her, a balmy &s;lumber &s;urpri&s;ed them. Their fea|tures, even in &s;leep, pre&s;erved the character of their &s;ouls. A &s;mile played innocent on the lips of Marano, her countenance was ineffably tender, and her tre&s;&s;es lay carele&s;s on her &s;nowy bo&s;om. The features of Sydney, of a bolder and more manly expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eemed full of benignity and complai&s;ance. Calm and unruffled was their re|po&s;e. They enjoyed the happy vi&s;ions of inno|cence, and dreamed not of impending danger.</P>
<P>The moon in unrivalled glory, had now attain|ed her meridian, when the intermitting noi&s;e of rowers came &s;lowly along the lake. A canoe was advancing, and the dripping oars ari&s;ing at inter|vals from the water, &s;hone gleaming along the deep. The boatman, &s;ilent and unob&s;erved, moored their ve&s;&s;el on the &s;andy beach; and a young man of a keen and animated a&s;pect, arrayed in the &s;haggy &s;kin of a bear, armed with a bow and a javelin, having left his companions, was ha&s;tening along the &s;hore. It was Oneyo. Having received
<PB N="22" REF="035333_0021_10022EBBE2FEB1C8">
wounds in the battle; he had been unable to pro|&s;ecute his return, and had tarried with &s;ome In|dians in the neighbourhood of Montreal. By the &s;kilful application of herbs and bal&s;ams his cure was at length effectuated, and he returned impatient to his nation.</P>
<P>'I will return &s;ecretly,' he &s;aid.
<Q>I will enjoy the &s;orrow and regret of Marano, and of my brethren, who, doubtle&s;s, believe me dead. I will enjoy the ec&s;tacy of their affection, and their &s;urpri&s;e on my unexpected arrival. My lovely Marano now laments uncon&s;oled. I will ha&s;ten to relieve her, and pre&s;s her, weeping with joy, to my faithful tran&s;ported bo&s;om.</Q></P>
<P>Such were the &s;entiments of anticipated rapture that occupied the &s;oul of Oneyo, when he di&s;cover|ed Marano in the arms of a &s;tranger. He recoiled. He &s;tood motionle&s;s in an agony of grief, anger, and a&s;toni&s;hment. Pale and trembling he uttered &s;ome words incoherently. He again advanced, again recogni&s;ed her, then turning abruptly, in bitter angui&s;h, &s;miting his brea&s;t.
<Q>Faithle&s;s and incon&s;tant,</Q>
he cried,
<Q>and is this my expected meeting! In the arms of a &s;tranger! Arrogant invader of my felicity! He &s;hall peri&s;h! His blood &s;hall expiate his offence.</Q>
Fury fla&s;hed in his eye, he gra&s;ped his javelin, he aimed the blow, and recogni&s;ed his deliverer. Surpri&s;e and horror &s;eized him.
<Q>Injured by my deliverer! By him, whom my &s;oul revered! And &s;hall I dip my hands in his blood! My life he pre&s;erved. Would to Heaven, he had &s;lain me! Thus in|jured
<PB N="23" REF="035333_0022_10022EBE38FC97B0">
and betrayed, Oneyo will not live.&mdash;Thou great univer&s;al Spirit, who&s;e path is in the clouds! Who&s;e voice is in the thunder! And who&s;e eye pierces the heart! O conduct me to the bli&s;sful valley, for Oneyo will not live.</Q>
He &s;ighed,
<Q>One look, one parting look of my love. I be|lieved her faithful; for her I lived, and for her I die.</Q>
He advanced towards her, gazing on her with angui&s;h and regret.
<Q>She will not weep for me! faithle&s;s and incon&s;tant! She will exult! Exult to behold me bleeding! And &s;hall it be? Have I cheri&s;hed her for this? and lavi&s;hed my &s;oul on her? to be betrayed! to give her love to a &s;tranger!</Q>
He pau&s;ed, trembled, his counte|nance grew fierce, his eye wild, he gra&s;ped his jav|elin.&mdash;Marano named him: Her voice was &s;oft and plaintive, her vi&s;ions were of Oneyo.
<Q>O come,</Q>
&s;he &s;aid,
<Q>ha&s;ten to thy love! Tarry not, my Oneyo! How I long to behold thee!</Q>
<Q>For this, &s;aid he, I'll embrace thee.</Q>
He embraced her; &s;he awakened, di&s;covered her hu&s;band, and flew eagerly into his arms. He flung from her in fierce indignation. 'Away,' he cried,
<Q>go, cher|i&s;h thy &s;tranger. Away, perfidious.</Q>
She fol|lowed him trembling and agha&s;t.
<Q>He is my brother,</Q>
&s;he cried.
'Thy brother'&mdash;
<Q>Stran|ger,</Q>
&s;aid he to the Briton, who now approached him,
<Q>you pre&s;erved my life. You are generous and valiant. Tell me then, am I to &s;alute thee as a friend, and give full vent to my gratitude! or, mu&s;t I view thee as a guileful &s;educer, and lift my javelin again&s;t thy life?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="035333_0023_10022EBFCC73D5F0">The Briton perceiving his error, an&s;wered him with brevity and compo&s;ure: He related to him the circum&s;tances of his captivity, and, in confir|mation, appealed to the te&s;timony of his father. Oneyo was &s;atisfied. He embraced them. They returned by morning to the village. Ononthio received them with becoming gladne&s;s, and the day was crowned with rejoicing.</P>

<P>CHOANG was the fonde&s;t hu&s;band, and Han&s;i the mo&s;t endearing wife, in all the king|dom of Corea. They were the pattern of conju|gal bli&s;s; the inhabitants of the country around &s;aw, and envied their felicity. Wherever Choang came, Han&s;i was &s;ure to follow; and in all the plea&s;ures of Han&s;i, Choang was admitted a part|ner. They walked hand in hand wherever they appeared, &s;hewing every mark of mutual &s;atisfac|tion, embracing, ki&s;&s;ing; their mouths were for|ever joined.</P>
<P>Their love was &s;o great, that it was thought no|thing could interrupt their mutual peace; when an accident happened, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di|mini&s;hed the hu&s;band's a&s;&s;urance of his wife's fi|delity; for love, &s;o refined as his, was &s;ubject to a thou&s;and little di&s;quietudes.</P>
<P>Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from his hou&s;e, he there perceived a lady dre&s;&s;ed in the deepe&s;t mourning, fanning the wet clay, that was rai&s;ed over one of the graves, with a large &s;an, which &s;he held in her hand. Choang, who had early been
<PB N="28" REF="035333_0027_10022ED840109DE8">
taught wi&s;dom in the &s;chool of Lao, was unable to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for her pre&s;ent employment; and coming up, civilly demanded the rea&s;on. 'Alas!' replied the lady, her eyes bathed in tears,
<Q>how is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;urvive the lo&s;s of my hu&s;band, who lies buried in this grave? He was the be&s;t of men, the tendere&s;t of hu&s;bands; with his dying breath he bid me never marry again, till the earth over his grave &s;hould be dry; and here you &s;ee me &s;teadily re&s;olving to obey his will, and en|deavouring to dry it with my fan. I have em|ployed two whole days in fulfilling his commands, and am determined not to marry, till they are punctually obeyed, even though his grave &s;hould take up four days in drying.</Q></P>
<P>Choang, who was &s;truck with the widow's beauty, could not, however, avoid &s;miling at her ha&s;te to be married; but, concealing the cau&s;e of his mirth, civilly invited her home; adding, that he had a wife, who might be capable of giving her &s;ome con&s;olation. As &s;oon as he and his gue&s;t were returned, he imparted to Han&s;i in private what he had &s;een, and could not avoid expre&s;&s;ing his unea&s;ine&s;s, that &s;uch might be his own ca&s;e, if his deare&s;t wife &s;hould one day happen to &s;urvive him.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe Han&s;i's re&s;entment at &s;o unkind a &s;u&s;picion. As her pa&s;&s;ion for him was not only great, but extremely delicate, &s;he em|ployed tears, anger, frowns, and exclamations, to chide his &s;u&s;picions; the widow her&s;elf was in|veighed again&s;t; and Han&s;i declared, &s;he was re|&s;olved
<PB N="29" REF="035333_0028_10022EDA8C7C6D28">
never to &s;leep under the &s;ame roof with a wretch, who, like her, could be guilty of &s;uch barefaced incon&s;tancy. The night was cold and &s;tormy; however, the &s;tranger was obliged to &s;eek another lodging, for Choang was not di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t, and Han&s;i would have her way.</P>
<P>The widow had &s;carce been gone an hour, when an old di&s;ciple of Choang's, whom he had not &s;een for many years, came to pay him a vi&s;it. He was received with the utmo&s;t ceremony, placed in the mo&s;t honourble &s;eat at &s;upper, and the wine began to circulate with great freedom. Choang and Han&s;i exhibited open marks of mutual ten|derne&s;s and unfeigned reconciliation; nothing could equal their apparent happine&s;s; &s;o fond a hu&s;band, &s;o obedient a wife, few could behold without regretting their own infelicity; when lo! their happine&s;s was at once di&s;turbed by a mo&s;t fatal accident. Choang fell lifele&s;s in an apoplec|tic fit upon the floor. Every method was u&s;ed, but in vain, for his recovery. Han&s;i was at fir&s;t incon&s;olable for her hu&s;band's death: After &s;ome hours, however, &s;he found &s;pirits to read his la&s;t will. The en&s;uing day &s;he began to moralize and talk wi&s;dom; the next day &s;he was able to comfort the young di&s;ciple; and, on the third, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, they both agreed to be married.</P>
<P>There was now no longer mourning in the apartments, the body of Choang was thru&s;t into an old coffin, and placed in one of the meane&s;t rooms, there to lie unattended until the time pre|&s;cribed by law for his interment. In the mean
<PB N="30" REF="035333_0029_10022EDC1B45A4C8">
time, Han&s;i and the young di&s;ciple were arrayed in the mo&s;t magnificent habits; the bride wore in her no&s;e a jewel, of immen&s;e price, and her lover was dre&s;&s;ed in all the finery of his former ma&s;ter, together with a pair of artificial whi&s;kers that reached to his middle. The hour of his nuptials was arrived; the whole family &s;ympathi&s;ed with their approaching happine&s;s; the apartments were brightened up with a light that diffu&s;ed the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite perfumes, and a lu&s;tre more bright than noonday. The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apartment, with impatience; when his &s;ervant, approaching with terror in his countenance, informed her that his ma&s;ter was fallen into a fit, which would certainly be mortal, unle&s;s the heart of a man lately dead, could be obtained, and ap|plied to his brea&s;t. She &s;carce waited to the end of his &s;tory, when, tucking up her clothes, &s;he ran with a mattock in her hand to the coffin, where Choang lay, re&s;olving to apply the heart of her dead hu&s;band, as a cure for the living. She there|fore &s;truck the lid with the utmo&s;t violence; in a few blows the coffin flew open, when the body, which to all appearance had been dead, began to move. Terrified at the &s;ight, Han&s;i dropped the mattock, and Choang walked out, a&s;toni&s;hed at his own &s;ituation, his wife's unu&s;ual magnificence, and her more amazing &s;urpri&s;e. He went among the apartments, unable to conceive the cau&s;e of &s;o much &s;plendor. He was not long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, be|fore his dome&s;tics informed him of every tran&s;ac|tion &s;ince he fir&s;t became in&s;en&s;ible. He could
<PB N="31" REF="035333_0030_10022EDE66CE0948">
&s;carce believe what they told him, and went in pur&s;uit of Han&s;i her&s;elf, in order to receive more certain information, or to reproach her infidelity. But &s;he prevented his reproaches: he &s;ound her weltering in blood; for &s;he had &s;tabbed her&s;elf to the heart, being unable to &s;urvive her &s;hame and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Choang, being a philo&s;opher, was too wi&s;e to make any loud lamentations; he thought it be&s;t to bear his lo&s;s with &s;erenity; &s;o mending up the old coffin, where he had lain him&s;elf, he placed his faithle&s;s &s;pou&s;e in his room; and, unwilling that &s;o many nuptial preparations &s;hould be expended in vain, he the &s;ame night married the widow with the large fan.</P>
<P>As they both were appri&s;ed of the foibles of each other beforehand, they knew how to excu&s;e them after marriage. They lived together for many years in great tranquillity, and not expecting to find rapture, made a &s;hift to find contentment.</P>

<P>NO ob&s;ervation is more common, and at the &s;ame time more true, than that one half of the world are ignorant how the other half live. The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of de|clamation;
<PB N="34" REF="035333_0033_10022EE493F36FE8">
and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble &s;ufferers: the great, under the pre&s;|&s;ure of calamity, are con&s;cious of others &s;ympathi&s;ing with their di&s;tre&s;s; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>There is nothing magnanimous in bearing mi&s;|fortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: men in &s;uch circum&s;tances will act bravely, even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of ob&s;curity, can brave adver&s;ity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintance to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes, can behave with tranquillity and indifference, is truly great: whether pea&s;ant or courtier, he de|&s;erves admiration, and &s;hould be held up for our imitation and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I have been led into the&s;e reflections, from ac|cidentally meeting, &s;ome days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's jacket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been hone&s;t and indu&s;trious, when in the country, and curious to learn what had reduced him to his pre|&s;ent &s;ituation; wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I de&s;ired to know the hi&s;tory of his life and misfortunes. The di&s;abled &s;oldier, for &s;uch he was, though dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's habit, &s;cratching his head, and leaning on his crutch, put him&s;elf into an attitude to comply with my re|que&s;t, and gave me his hi&s;tory, as follows:</P>
<P>'As for my misfortunes, ma&s;ter, I can't pre|tend to have gone through any more than other
<PB N="35" REF="035333_0034_10022EF15C6610B8">
folks; for except the lo&s;s of my limb, and my be|ing obliged to beg, I don't know any rea&s;on, thank heaven, that I have to complain; there is <HI>BILL TIBBS,</HI> of our regiment, he has lo&s;t both his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank heaven, it is not &s;o bad with me yet. I was born in <HI>Shrop&s;hire;</HI> my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old; &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wandering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;h|ioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belong|ed, or where I was born; &s;o they &s;ent me to ano|ther pari&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept &s;ending me about &s;o long, that they would not let me be in born any pari&s;h at all; but, at la&s;t, however, they fixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and was re|&s;olved at lea&s;t to know my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the workhou&s;e put me to bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an ea&s;y kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not &s;uffer|ed to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e, for fear, as they &s;aid, I &s;hould run away. But what of that? I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my bu&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died, when I was ob|liged to provide for my&s;elf; &s;o I was re&s;olved to go and &s;eek my fortune.</P>
<P>'In this manner I went from town to town,
<PB N="36" REF="035333_0035_10022EF49CBF3508">
worked where I could get employment, and &s;tarved when I could get none; when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a ju&s;tice of peace, I &s;pied a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it. Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away, when the ju&s;tice him&s;elf met me: he called me a poacher, and, collaring me, de&s;ired I would give an account of my&s;elf. I fell upon my knees, beg|ged his wor&s;hip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, &s;eed, and generation; but, though I gave a very true ac|count, the ju&s;tice &s;aid I could give no account, &s;o I was indicted at the Se&s;&s;ions, found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent up to London, to Newgate, in order to be tran&s;ported as a vagabond.</P>
<P>'People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my bellyfull to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to la&s;t forever; &s;o I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board a &s;hip, and &s;ent off with two hundred more, to the plantations. We had but an indifferent pa&s;&s;age; for being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of &s;weet air; and tho&s;e that remained were &s;ickly enough, God knows. When we came a&s;hore, we were &s;old to the planters, and I was bound for &s;even years more. As I was no &s;cholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes;
<PB N="37" REF="035333_0036_10022EF62A1B4430">
and I &s;erved out my time as in duty bound to do.</P>
<P>'When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;&s;age home; and glad I was to &s;ee Old England again, becau&s;e I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vagabond once more, &s;o did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs, when I could get them.</P>
<P>'I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then de&s;ired me to &s;tand. They belonged to a pre&s;s gang. I was carried before the ju&s;tice, and, as I could give no account of my&s;elf, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;oldier. I cho&s;e the latter, and, in this po&s;t of a gentleman, I &s;erved two campaigns in Flanders, was at the battle of Val and Vontenoy, and received but one wound, through the brea&s;t here; but the doctor of our regiment &s;oon made me well again.</P>
<P>'When the peace came on, I was di&s;charged: and, as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, I li&s;ted for a land&s;man in the Ea&s;t India company's &s;ervice. I have fought the French in &s;ix pitched battles; and I verily believe, that if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and &s;o got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, and I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pend|ing
<PB N="38" REF="035333_0037_10022EF8B54106B0">
my money; but the government wanted men, and &s;o I was pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;ailor, before ever I could &s;et foot on &s;hore.</P>
<P>'The boat&s;wain &s;ound me, as he &s;aid, an ob&s;ti|nate fellow; he &s;wore he knew that I under&s;tood my bu&s;ine&s;s well, but that I &s;hammed Abraham, to be idle; but God knows, I knew nothing of &s;ea-bu&s;ine&s;s, and he beat me without con&s;ider|ing what he was about. I had &s;till, however, my forty pounds, and that was &s;ome comfort to me, under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our &s;hip was taken by the French, and &s;o I lo&s;t it all.</P>
<P>'Our crew was carried into Bre&s;t, and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in jail; but for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned. One night, as I was a&s;leep on my bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, (for I always loved to lie well) I was awakened by the boat&s;wain, who had a dark lanthorn in his hand. 'Jack,' &s;ays he to me,
<Q>will you knock out the French centry's brains?</Q>
'I don't care,' &s;ays I, &s;triving to keep my&s;elf awake,
<Q>if I lend a hand.</Q>
'Then follow me,' &s;ays he, 'and I hope we &s;hall do the bu&s;ine&s;s.' So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the clothes I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the French|men. I hate the French, becau&s;e they are all &s;laves, and wear wooden &s;hoes.</P>
<P>'Though we had no arms, one Engli&s;hman is able to beat five French at any time; &s;o we went down to the door, where both the centries
<PB N="39" REF="035333_0038_10022EFB06781120">
were po&s;ted, and, ru&s;hing upon them, &s;eized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the quay, and &s;eizing the fir&s;t boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to &s;ea. We had not been here three days, before we were taken up by the Dor&s;et privateer, who were glad of &s;o many good hands; and we con&s;ented to run our chance. However, we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty three; &s;o to it we went, yard-arm and yard-arm. The fight la&s;ted for three hours, and I verily believe, we &s;hould have taken the Frenchman, had we but had &s;ome more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we lo&s;t all our men, ju&s;t as we were going to get the victory.</P>
<P>'I was once more in the power of the French, and, I believe, it would have gone hard with me, had I been brought back to Bre&s;t; but by good fortune we were retaken by the Viper. I had al|mo&s;t forgot to tell you, that in that engagement, I was wounded in two places; I lo&s;t four fingers off the left hand, and my leg was &s;hot off. If I had had the good fortune to have lo&s;t my leg and the u&s;e of my hand, on board a king's &s;hip, and not on board a privateer, I &s;hould have been intitled to clothing and maintenance during the re&s;t of my life; but that was not my chance: one man is born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, ble&s;&s;ed be God! I enjoy good health, and will forever love liberty
<PB N="40" REF="035333_0039_10022EFC9327D6D0">
and Old England. Liberty, property, and Old England, forever, huzza!'</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he limped off, leaving me in ad|miration at his intrepidity and content; nor could I avoid acknowledging, that an habitual acquaint|ance with mi&s;ery &s;erves better than philo&s;ophy to teach us to de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>

<HEAD>THE RUINS OF THE HOUSE OF ALBERT. A ROMANCE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Then welcome death, &s;ince death alone can prove,</L>
<L>The mournful &s;olace to a con&s;tant love.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ADELA was the only daughter of a powerful baron of Aquitaine. Her father, &s;prung from an illu&s;trious family, added to hereditary honours, the glory of heroic achievements. In his youth, he accompanied the flower of the Europe|an chivalry, who fought under the banner of God|frey, and recovered the holy &s;epulchre from the hands of the infidel. He returned to his country, crowned with victory and fair renown; and in|herited the rich domains of his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Adela was in the prime of beauty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;u&s;ceptible heart. In her air and a&s;pect, digni|ty was mingled with &s;weetne&s;s: For in the di&s;po|&s;ition of her mind, con&s;cious elevation of &s;enti|ment was &s;oftened by amiable and mild affections.</P>
<P>Edwin, a gallant youth, animated with the generous love of arms, &s;mit with the renown of Albert's prowe&s;s, and ambitious of profiting by the narrative of his exploits, repaired with other warriors to his ho&s;pitable ca&s;tle. His eye, keen and piercing, indicated a fiery, vigorous and ac|tive
<PB N="45" REF="035333_0044_10022F0753C5D038">
&s;pirit: His form was well fitted to kindle de|&s;ire in the bo&s;om of tender maids: And the heart of Adela was not in&s;en&s;ible to his merit. Their pa&s;&s;ion was mutual. He gazed on her unaffected charms with a&s;toni&s;hment; for till then, he had never felt the tender anxiety, the re&s;tle&s;s longing, and langui&s;hment of love. Ambition had been the governing pa&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul; but the fierce|ne&s;s of ambition now yielded to a &s;ofter, though no le&s;s ardent de&s;ire. He no longer di&s;cour&s;ed, in keen rapture, of mar&s;halled ho&s;ts, of li&s;ted fields, and feats of venturous daring; but langui&s;hed on the ineffable attractions of a ro&s;eate complexion, and a tender melting eye. The vehement impatience of the warrior was lo&s;t in the complacency and pen&s;ivene&s;s of the lover.</P>
<P>Albert, perceiving this change in his deport|ment, demanded the cau&s;e. Edwin replied in candid and re&s;pectful gui&s;e: He told him, without re&s;erve, of the impre&s;&s;ion made on his &s;oul, by the peerle&s;s beauty of Adela. And, with the temerity of youthful pa&s;&s;ion, be&s;ought him to ratify his &s;in|cere attachment by wedlock.
<Q>And who art thou,</Q>
&s;aid the houghty baron,
<Q>who pretende&s;t to the love of Adela? What feats of heroic prowe&s;s ha&s;t thou achieved? Or is thy ance&s;try di&s;tingui&s;hed among the chieftains of the &s;outh? Thy &s;hield is in&s;cribed with no valorous achieve|ment; nor are thy deeds, nor the deeds of thy fathers, rehear&s;ed by recording min&s;trels. Gain thee a name in arms, and then a&s;pire to the envied alliance of the Hou&s;e of Albert.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="035333_0045_10022F09C438BFE0">The&s;e words, like an arrow, penetrated the heart of Edwin. Love and ambition, hitherto at variance, were now united; they concurred in the &s;ame pur&s;uit; and their vehemence was irre&s;i&s;ti|ble. Accordingly, the youthful warrior prepared for his departure, and took a tender farewell of Adela. 'Farewell,' &s;he replied, the tears gu&s;hing from her radiant eyes,
<Q>Heaven knows no gallant youth, but thee, ever &s;hared my affections. May the holy angels, who regard true and virtuous love with e&s;teem, grant thee protection. Speedy be thy return! and O! remember me. Gay and courtly dames, &s;killed in &s;educements and cunning device, may &s;trive to allure thee; but their love will not equal mine.</Q>
They plighted vows of mutual fidelity, and exchanged tokens of un&s;haken attachment. Then Edwin, clad in com|plete armour, a gay undaunted warrior, mounted a &s;teed proudly capari&s;oned, and bent his cour&s;e to the plains of Catalonia, where the Saracen waded in the blood of Spain.</P>
<P>Soon after his departure, Edgar, a proud and wealthy chieftain, with a numerous retinue of knights and retainers, came to the ca&s;tle of Albert. He was received with pomp and ho&s;pitable wel|come. He ca&s;t amorous glances on the re&s;erved, unrivalled charms of Adela. He preferred his court&s;hip with &s;tudied &s;miles and &s;peeches devi&s;ed with cunning. She heard him at fir&s;t with indif|ference; he per&s;i&s;ted; and &s;he requited him with contempt. He then addre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit to the bar|on: He boa&s;ted of the high renown of his ance&s;|tors,
<PB N="47" REF="035333_0046_10022F0B95AA43C0">
and the wide extent of his domain: He ex|patiated on the number of his va&s;&s;als; and in&s;i&s;t|ed, in magnificent terms, on the mutual honour and &s;ecurity that would accrue from &s;o &s;eemly an alliance. Albert li&s;tened to him with partial and plea&s;ed attention: He repented of the hopes he had encouraged in the &s;oul of Edwin; and he en|deavored to per&s;uade his daughter to forget her attachment to that valiant youth. In vain the a&s;|toni&s;hed Adela lamented, wept, intreated; in vain &s;he threw her&s;elf at her father's feet, and tore her di&s;hevelled tre&s;&s;es, and in angui&s;h &s;mote her brea&s;t. Her oppo&s;ition, in&s;tead of mitigating his rigour, irritated his re&s;entment, and confirmed him in his ungenerous purpo&s;e. He mingled menaces and unkindly reproach with his per&s;ua&s;ions:
<Q>By the holy rood,</Q>
&s;aid he, with a fa&s;tidious and wrathful a&s;pect,
<Q>the honor of my hou&s;e &s;hall not be &s;tained by the preten&s;ions of a low-born boy. Degenerated as thou art, the meanne&s;s of thy &s;entiments &s;hall not fully the &s;plendour of thine ance&s;try, nor load my re&s;pected age with di&s;honour. Receive the addre&s;&s;es of Edgar with &s;uitable regard, and the deference due to my commands. Meantime preparations &s;hall be made for the bridal &s;olemnity in a manner be|coming the dignity of this alliance.</Q></P>
<P>Adela, after remon&s;trating in vain again&s;t the &s;everity of his commands, intreated, with an hum|ble and dejected air, that the marriage-ceremony might be delayed. 'Can Edgar,' &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>prize the cold and con&s;trained embraces of a heart
<PB N="48" REF="035333_0047_10022F0E9F24D6E0">
that throbs for another? Will the &s;ighing and an|gui&s;h of a broken &s;pirit accord with the fond ca|re&s;&s;es of a bridegroom? To Edwin my faith was plighted, and on him my imagination hath dwelt. Give me time, therefore, to divert the current of an affection too violent to be &s;uddenly oppo&s;ed; to di&s;courage the reveries of fancy, animated by a legal and habituated pa&s;&s;ion; and to be reconciled to the addre&s;&s;es of Edgar.</Q>
As her rea&s;oning was plau&s;ible, the nuptial &s;olemnity was deferred. But, as &s;oon as &s;he retired from her father's pre&s;ence, &s;he &s;ummoned a page in whom &s;he confided, and &s;poke to him in the fol|lowing manner:
<Q>Prepare thee for a long journey: Saddle the fleete&s;t of my father's &s;teeds; and during the ob&s;curity of the night, depart. Hie thee to the banks of the Ebro; find Edwin; tell him of the perils that be&s;et me; tell him that a wealthy and powerful rival, with co&s;tly parade, and glittering &s;hew of blazonry, hath impo&s;ed on my father, and in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his e&s;teem.</Q>
The menial bowed with humble obei&s;ance, and, with profe&s;&s;ions of diligence and fidelity, departed.</P>
<P>Meantime Edgar pre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit with courteous phra&s;e and dalliance. Daily tournaments were exhibited at the ca&s;tle of Albert. The knights and barons of the neighbouring domains attended: But Edgar &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in the &s;plendour of his armour, and the pomp of his retinue. The hall re&s;ounded with revelry and rejoicing; and min|&s;trels clad in gaudy apparel celebrated the prai&s;es of warlike chiefs, or &s;ung the power and the plea&s;|ures
<PB N="49" REF="035333_0048_10022F102CCA52E8">
of love. Adela arrayed her countenance with &s;miles and courte&s;y; but her bo&s;om was di&s;tracted with angui&s;h, and her couch was bedewed with weeping. 'O when,' &s;he cried,
<Q>&s;hall I be deliv|ered from the importunity of a dete&s;ted &s;uitor; and the bondage of a feigned complacency? When will Edwin return, adorned with conque&s;t, and confident with &s;ucce&s;s? His merit &s;hall &s;hine unrivalled, and Edgar be covered with &s;hame.</Q></P>
<P>At length the page returned; and repairing to the apartment of his mournful dame,
<Q>Now heav|en fore&s;end,</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q>mo&s;t gracious lady, that the tidings I bring &s;hould injure thy tender frame more than thou art able to endure. May the &s;aints and mini&s;tering angels uphold thee!</Q>
&mdash; 'Hath he peri&s;hed?' cried Adela, with a look of terror and amazement.
<Q>In what bloody field hath he fallen? Where lies the lifele&s;s body? What barbarous adver&s;ary hath mangled and in&s;ulted his graceful form?</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>He hath not peri&s;hed,</Q>
replied the menial.
<Q>But O gentle lady! foul arts have been practi&s;ed; &s;hameful per|fidy hath been committed. Edwin lives, but not for thee; he hath given his hand to another!</Q>
&mdash;
'Peace, peace!' interrupted Adela, with a faulter|ing utterance, and looks of a&s;toni&s;hment, mixed with anger;
<Q>re&s;train thy bla&s;phemous &s;peech: nor with ba&s;e calumny a&s;per&s;e the fame of a true and gallant warrior.</Q>
&mdash;'When,' an&s;wered the me|nial,
<Q>have I been guilty of deceit or infidelity towards my gentle mi&s;tre&s;s? Full &s;ore it grieveth me to be the me&s;&s;enger of evil tidings.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>Re|hear&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="035333_0049_10022F11BA0C88E0">
them unre&s;ervedly,</Q>
cried Adela, with a tone of anxious impatience.</P>
<P>'I pur&s;ued my journey,' &s;aid he,
<Q>many days without any adventure, till I came within &s;ight of a &s;tately ca&s;tle. It &s;tood on the brow of a woody hill; was garni&s;hed with towers and bat|tlements; and commanded a wide pro&s;pect of cultivaled fields and fore&s;ts. As I advanced, mine ear was &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed with the din of hounds and horns, mingled with the cries of the hunt&s;men. I &s;oon de&s;cried a gallant &s;hew of knights and gorgeous dames, mounted on milk-white cour&s;ers, and pur&s;uing the rapid deer. When the chace was ended, they &s;topped by the &s;ide of a chry&s;tal brook; and a comely youth, arrayed in &s;hining apparel, alighted from his foamy &s;teed, with courtly obei&s;ance, pre&s;ented the prey to a fair and &s;miling lady. I mingled in their company, and in the lineaments of the cour|teous youth recogni&s;ed the incon&s;tant Edwin. O gentle lady, may Heaven &s;o help me in my ut|mo&s;t need, as I now &s;peak the words of truth; and may the faints and holy angels &s;o &s;uccour thee as thy mi&s;hap requires. The faithle&s;s youth hath committed trea&s;on again&s;t thy love: Seduc|ed by the blandi&s;hment of an artful dame, he hath become forgetful of thy peerle&s;s beauty.</Q></P>
<P>The heart of Adela throbbed with angui&s;h dur|ing the recital. 'Valorous, heroic warrior!' &s;he exclaimed,
<Q>are the&s;e thy deeds of hardy prowe&s;s, to betray the innocent credulity of an ea&s;y maid! Stain to manhood, and the honored profe&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="51" REF="035333_0050_10022F176C53BF70">
arms, be henceforth bani&s;hed from my remem|brance.</Q></P>
<P>Meantime Edgar advanced his &s;uit with re|doubled ardour. Albert, unable to brook any longer delay, in&s;i&s;ted on having the bridal ceremo|ny &s;olemnized; and Adela, incited by &s;ecret pride and re&s;entment, &s;ubmitted to the will of her father. The report of this noble alliance was publi&s;hed through the land; and the kindred of Albert and Edgar, with the neighbouring barons, were a&s;&s;em|bled to grace the &s;olemnity. Already were the parties betrothed; the holy benediction was al|ready pronounced; and forever was Adela to be the wedded &s;pou&s;e of Edgar. Now, with pom|pous &s;hew and attendance the banquet was &s;erved up to dames and knights, the flower of courte&s;y and valour. The ca&s;tle re&s;ounded with min&s;trel&s;y and the dance, when a &s;tranger, in the &s;imple garb of a pilgrim, entered the hall. He ca&s;t his eyes around on the goodly company, and, with an air of &s;anctity and re&s;pect, implored a ble&s;&s;ing on their friend&s;hip. He was received with ho&s;pitable welcome, and the reverence due to his holy &s;em|blance. He &s;pake in meek and mode&s;t gui&s;e; his eyes were often fixed on Adela: they were &s;ome|times dimmed with a gli&s;tening tear, and ever and anon his bo&s;om heaved with involuntary &s;ighs. He took up the harp of a min&s;trel; he touched the &s;trings with ma&s;terly cunning, and accompa|nied the notes with a melodious voice. Tuneful, but melancholy was the &s;train; for he &s;ung the &s;orrows of tho&s;e that are for&s;aken; the angui&s;h of
<PB N="52" REF="035333_0051_10022F18F8D84EA0">
a de&s;ponding &s;pirit; and the wounds inflicted on a faithful heart by incon&s;tancy and proud di&s;dain. He de&s;i&s;ted with marks of grief and inward con|tention. 'Holy pilgrim,' &s;aid Albert,
<Q>the &s;en&s;e of calamity devours thy &s;pirit. Inform us of thy mi&s;hhap, that, if po&s;&s;ible, we may admini&s;ter com|fort. Nor think it incompatible with bridal fe&s;|tivity to indulge compa&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;uage the torment of heart-felt care.</Q></P>
<P>'I am the &s;on of a freeman,' replied the &s;tran|ger;
<Q>and though my birth was not ennobled by &s;plendid titles, nor my ance&s;try di&s;tingui&s;hed by the parade of blazonry, my bo&s;om burned with the love of arms, and my heart was upright. In an unlucky hour I became enamoured of a gentle dame, the only daughter of a noble baron. My &s;incere, though pre&s;umptuous &s;uit, &s;eemed not di&s;plea&s;ing to that peerle&s;s beauty; and with the ra&s;h, intemperate boldne&s;s of a lover, I a&s;ked her in marriage of her &s;ire. Go, &s;aid he, gain thee a name in arms, and then a&s;pire to the en|vied alliance of my hou&s;e. I departed, not with|out tender interchange of vows and tokens of af|fection with the beloved idol of my heart. I ha&s;|tened to the plains of Catalonia, where the Sara|cen was waging fierce battle again&s;t the banner of the holy cro&s;s. I proffered my &s;ervice to the chief of the Chri&s;tians; and that my &s;word was not idle, and that I was not backward in the &s;trife of arms, my honourable wounds can te&s;tify. Neither were my &s;ervices, nor my thir&s;t after mar|tial fame unrewarded. Fair recompence have I
<PB N="53" REF="035333_0052_10022F1CECCFCD40">
received, and the fun of glory hath gilded the ob&s;curity of my birth. Rejoicing in my &s;ucce&s;s, I ha&s;tened my return. But what power of ut|terance can expre&s;s the agony of my &s;oul, when I learned that the faithle&s;s and incon&s;tant dame had yielded to the vows of another? I who was &s;o true and loyal to my love and plighted troth, to be &s;o &s;oon forgot, &s;o &s;oon for&s;aken.</Q></P>
<P>'Enough! enough!' cried Adela,
<Q>O ill-requit|ed lover! pierce not my &s;oul with deeper wounds. O Edwin! Edwin! never was I incon&s;tant. Bear witne&s;s, ye holy angels! But traitorous guile has been practi&s;ed: Thy integrity hath been im|peached, and my vexed heart betrayed into er|rour.</Q></P>
<P>The eyes of all were now turned on the &s;tran|ger: He threw off his di&s;gui&s;e, and, in&s;tead of a pilgrim's &s;taff, he gra&s;ped a keen and trenchant weapon. Re&s;entment glowed on his cheek, and fla&s;hed from his fiery eye. 'And who,' &s;aid he,
<Q>hath impeached mine integrity? Stand forth, thou proud, but da&s;tard baron, who&s;e glozing tales have betrayed the unwary heart of a tender maiden: It is Edwin demands reparation.</Q>
Con|&s;cious fear was manife&s;t in the di&s;ordered features, the pale cheek, and di&s;concerted air of Edgar. He neverthele&s;s accepted the challenge; and the two warriors, arraying them&s;elves in complete ar|mour, de&s;cended into the court of the ca&s;tle. In the fir&s;t on&s;et, the well tempered &s;teel of Edwin cleft the cre&s;ted helm of his adver&s;ary; he threw him to the ground, and di&s;armed him.
<Q>Confe&s;s
<PB N="54" REF="035333_0053_10022F1FF49067D8">
thy guilt,</Q>
&s;aid the conqueror,
<Q>and by what in|famous arts thou ha&s;t accompli&s;hed thy de&s;ign.</Q>
&mdash; 'By gifts and glittering gold,' he replied,
<Q>I cor|rupted the page of Adela, who, with counterfeited &s;emblance of fidelity and regret, accu&s;ed thee of incon&s;tancy, and impo&s;ed fal&s;hood on the ea&s;y ear of his mi&s;tre&s;s. I embraced the &s;ea&s;on of her excited re&s;entment, and forwarded my &s;uit with &s;ucce&s;s. She is mine by the indi&s;&s;oluble ties of wedlock: And know, proud boy, that if thy hands be &s;tained with my blood, it is the blood of Adela's hu&s;band; and if &s;he receives thee to her bo&s;om, &s;he receives the &s;layer of her &s;pou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Edwin &s;tarted with apparent horror. He pau&s;|ed; but recollecting him&s;elf, 'Ari&s;e,' he cried,
<Q>and by another trial, prove thy&s;elf worthy of that envied title.</Q>
So &s;aying, he rai&s;ed him from the ground; and both warriors addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves a &s;econd time to the fight. Edgar, burning with exa&s;perated rancour, aimed his &s;pear at his rival's brea&s;t. Edwin neither averted nor avoided the deadly blow. The keen weapon cleft his brea&s;t, and was tinged in the purple &s;prings of his heart. He fell to the ground. 'Farewell,' he cried,
<Q>A|dela! lady peerle&s;s! and dearly beloved. I have proved my&s;elf worthy of thy e&s;teem: I die a &s;a|crifice to thy repo&s;e. With my hands red with thy hu&s;band's blood, could I ever a&s;pire to thy love? Could I &s;urvive and behold thee the wed|ded bride of another!</Q>
He heaved a &s;igh and died. 'Inhuman deed!' cried Adela, tearing her lovely tre&s;&s;es, and beating her &s;now-white brea&s;t. She
<PB N="55" REF="035333_0054_10022F2186C5E6E8">
ran, &s;he threw her&s;elf on the bloody body, 'O &s;tay!' &s;he exclaimed,
<Q>O leave me not in my woe. Re|turn, fleeting &s;pirit! Reanimate the&s;e pallid features. He heeds me not.&mdash;I heard a voice! a dreary voice! It was Edwin! He &s;ummons me away!&mdash;I come! I come! Let the nuptial bed be prepared! the clay-cold bed!</Q>
&mdash; So &s;ay|ing, &s;he cla&s;ped the corp&s;e, and expired.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly the menial, who had been corrupted by Edgar, &s;eizing a dagger, ru&s;hed behind that treacherous baron, and pierced him to the heart. 'Peri&s;h!' he cried,
<Q>author of my ruin, and of the ruin of the Hou&s;e of Albert.</Q>
He grew imme|diately frantic: He ran forth furious and &s;cream|ing: The memory of his crimes pur&s;ued him; and his rea&s;on was never re&s;tored.</P>
<P>The ob&s;equies of the decea&s;ed were celebrated with due &s;olemnity; Holy requiems were chanted over their remains; and pious prie&s;ts preferred ori&s;ons for their eternal repo&s;e. Albert, unable to &s;u&s;tain the weight of his misfortune, for&s;ook the habitation of his ance&s;tors; and expo&s;ing his old age to fatigue, undertook a pilgrimage to the Ho|ly Land, where he ended his days in a mona&s;tery.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EDWARD the Third, after the battle of Cre&s;&s;y, laid &s;iege to Calais. He had fortified his camp in &s;o impregnable a manner, that all the efforts of France proved ineffectual to rai&s;e the &s;iege, or throw &s;uccours into the city. The citi|zens, however, under the conduct of Count Vienne, their gallant governour, made an admirable de|fence. Day after day the Engli&s;h effected many a breach, which they repeatedly expected to &s;torm by morning; but, when morning appeared, they wondered to behold new ramparts rai&s;ed, nightly erected out of the ruins which the day had made.</P>
<P>France had now put the &s;ickle into her &s;econd harve&s;t &s;ince Edward with his victorious army &s;at down before the town. The eyes of all Europe were intent on the i&s;&s;ue. The Engli&s;h made their approaches and attacks without remi&s;&s;ion; but the citizens were as ob&s;tinate in repelling all their ef|forts.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="035333_0058_10022F2A42B498B0">At length, famine did more for Edward than arms. After the citizens had devoured the lean carca&s;es of their &s;tarved cattle, they tore up old foundations and rubbi&s;h in &s;earch of vermin. They fed on boiled leather and the weeds of exhau&s;ted gardens, and a mor&s;el of damaged corn was ac|counted a matter of luxury.</P>
<P>In this extremity they re&s;olved to attempt the enemy's camp. They boldly &s;allied forth; the Engli&s;h joined battle; and, after a long and de&s;pe|rate engagement, Count Vienne was taken pri&s;on|er; and the citizens, who &s;urvived the &s;laughter, retired within their gates.</P>
<P>On the captivity of the governour, the command devolved upon Eu&s;tace Saint Pierre, the mayor of the town, a man of mean birth, but of exalted virtue.</P>
<P>Eu&s;tace now found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of capitulating, and offered to deliver to Edward the city, with all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and wealth of the inhabitants, provided he permitted them to depart with life and liberty.</P>
<P>As Edward had long &s;ince expected to a&s;cend the throne of France, he was exa&s;perated, to the la&s;t degree, again&s;t the&s;e people, who&s;e &s;ole valour had defeated his warme&s;t hopes; he therefore de|termined to take an exemplary revenge, though he wi&s;hed to avoid the imputation of cruelty. He an&s;wered, by Sir Walter Manny, that they all de|&s;erved capital puni&s;hment, as ob&s;tinate traitors to him, their true and natural &s;overeign. That, how|ever, in his wonted clemency, he con&s;ented to par|don
<PB N="60" REF="035333_0059_10022F2C909BA9C8">
the bulk of the plebeians, provided they would deliver up to him &s;ix of their principal citizens, with halters about their necks, as victims of due atonement for that &s;pirit of rebellion with which they had enflamed the vulgar herd.</P>
<P>All the remains of this de&s;olate city were con|vened in the great &s;quare, and, like men arraign|ed at a tribunal from whence there was no appeal, expected with beating hearts the &s;entence of their conqueror.</P>
<P>When Sir Walter had declared his me&s;&s;age, con|&s;ternation and pale di&s;may was impre&s;&s;ed on every face. Each looked upon death as his own inevita|ble lot; for how &s;hould they de&s;ire to be &s;aved at the price propo&s;ed? whom had they to deliver &s;ave parents, brothers, kindred, or valiant neighbours, who had &s;o often expo&s;ed their lives in their de|fence? To a long and dead &s;ilence, deep &s;ighs and groans &s;ucceeded; till Eu&s;tace St. Pierre, getting up to a little eminence, thus addre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;em|bly.</P>
<P><Q>My friends, we are brought to great &s;traits this day. We mu&s;t either &s;ubmit to the terms of our cruel and en&s;naring conqueror; or yield up our tender infants, our wives, and cha&s;te daughters, to the bloody and brutal lu&s;ts of the violating &s;oldiery.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Look about you, my friends, and fix your eyes on the per&s;ons, whom you wi&s;h to deliver up as the victims of your own &s;afety. Which of the&s;e would ye appoint to the rack, the axe, or the hal|ter? Is there any here who has not fought for
<PB N="61" REF="035333_0060_10022F2E459EF700">
you, who has not bled for you? who through the length of this inveterate &s;iege, has not &s;uffered fatigues and mi&s;eries, a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death, that you and your's might &s;urvive to days of peace and pro&s;perity? Is it your pre&s;erv|ers, then, whom you would de&s;tine to de&s;truction? you will not, you cannot do it. Ju&s;tice, honour, humanity, make &s;uch a trea&s;on impo&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Where then is our re&s;ource? Is there any ex|pedient left, whereby we may avoid guilt and in|famy on the one hand, or the de&s;olation and hor|rors of a &s;acked city on the other? There is, my friends, there is one expedient left; a gracious, an excellent, a god-like expedient! Is there any here to whom virtue is dearer than life; let him offer him&s;elf an oblation for the &s;afety of his people! He &s;hall not fail of a ble&s;&s;ed approba|tion from that Power, who offered up his only Son for the &s;alvation of mankind.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;poke &mdash; but an univer&s;al &s;ilence en&s;ued. Each man looked around for the example of that virtue and magnanimity, in others, which all wi&s;h|ed to approve in them&s;elves, though they wanted the re&s;olution.</P>
<P>At length St. Pierre re&s;umed&mdash;
<Q>It had been ba&s;e in me, my fellow citizens, to propo&s;e any matter of damage to others, which I my&s;elf had not been willing to undergo in my own per&s;on. But I held it ungenerous to deprive any man of that preference and e&s;timation, which might at|tend a fir&s;t offer, on &s;o &s;ignal an occa&s;ion. For I doubt not but there are many here as ready,
<PB N="62" REF="035333_0061_10022F3099E35D78">
nay, more zealous of this martyrdom than I can be, however mode&s;ty and the fear of imputed o&s;|tentation may withhold them from being foremo&s;t in exhibiting their merits.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed, the &s;tation, to which the captivity of Lord Vienne has unhappily rai&s;ed me, imparts a right to be the fir&s;t in giving my life for your &s;akes, I give it freely, I give it cheerfully; who comes next?</Q></P>
<P>'Your &s;on.' exclaimed a youth, not yet come to maturity.&mdash;'Ah, my child!' cried St. Pierre,
<Q>I am, then, twice &s;acrificed.&mdash;But no&mdash;I have rather begotten thee a &s;econd time.&mdash;Thy years are few but full, my &s;on! the victim of virtue has reached the utmo&s;t purpo&s;e and goal of mortality. Who next, my friends?&mdash;This is the hour of heroes.</Q>
&mdash;'Your kin&s;man,' cried John de Aire. 'Your kin&s;man,' cried James Wi&s;&s;ant.
<Q>Your kin&s;man,</Q>
cried Peter Wi&s;&s;ant. &mdash;'Ah!' ex|claimed Sir Walter Mauny, bur&s;ting into tears, 'why was I not a citizen of Calais?'</P>
<P>The &s;ixth victim was &s;till wanting, but was quickly &s;upplied by lot, from numbers, who were now emulous of &s;o ennobling an example.</P>
<P>The keys of the city were then delivered to Sir Walter. He took the &s;ix pri&s;oners into his cu&s;to|dy. He ordered the gates to be opened, and gave charge to his attendants to conduct the remaining citizens, with their families, through the camp of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Before they departed, however, they de&s;ired per|mi&s;&s;ion to take their la&s;t adieu of their deliverers.
<PB N="63" REF="035333_0062_10022F32E51E3A50">
&mdash;What a parting, what a &s;cene! they crouded with their wives and children about St. Pierre and his fellow pri&s;oners. They embraced, they clung around, they wept aloud; and the joint clamour of their mourning pa&s;&s;ed the gates of the city, and was heard throughout the camp.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, by this time, were appri&s;ed of what pa&s;&s;ed within Calais. They heard the voice of lamentation, and their &s;ouls were touched with compa&s;&s;ion: each of the &s;oldiers prepared a por|tion of their own victuals to welcome and enter|tain the half fami&s;hed inhabitants; and they load|ed them with as much as their pre&s;ent weakne&s;s was able to bear, in order to &s;upply them with &s;u&s;|tenance by the way.</P>
<P>At length, St. Pierre and his fellow victims ap|peared, under the conduct of Sir Walter and a guard. All the tents of the Engli&s;h were in&s;tant|ly emptied. The &s;oldiers poured from all parts, and arranged them&s;elves on each &s;ide, to behold, to contemplate, to admire this little band of patri|ots as they pa&s;&s;ed. They murmured their ap|plau&s;e of that virtue, which they could not but re|vere, even in enemies. And they regarded tho&s;e ropes, which they had voluntarily a&s;&s;umed about their necks, as en&s;igns of greater dignity than that of the Briti&s;h garter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had reached the pre&s;ence of the king&mdash;'Mauny!' &s;ays the monarch, 'are the&s;e the principal inhabitants of Calais?'&mdash;'They are,' &s;ays Mauny,
<Q>they are not only the principal men of Calais, they are the principal men of France, my lord, if virtue has any &s;hare in the act of en|nobling.</Q>
<PB N="64" REF="035333_0063_10022F3531CF53D8">
&mdash;'Were they delivered peaceably,' &s;ays Edward;
<Q>was there no re&s;i&s;tance, no commotion among the people?</Q>
<Q>Not in the lea&s;t, my lord; the people would all have peri&s;hed, rather than have delivered the lea&s;t of the&s;e to your Maje&s;ty. They are &s;elf-delivered, &s;elf-devoted, and come to offer up their ine&s;timable heads as an ample equiv|alent for the ran&s;om of thou&s;ands.</Q></P>
<P>Edward was &s;ecretly piqued at this reply of Sir Walter, but he knew the privilege of a Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment. 'Experience,' &s;ays he,
<Q>hath ever &s;hewn, that lenity only &s;erves to invite people to new crimes. Severity, at times, is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to deter &s;ubjects into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by puni&s;hment and example. Go,</Q>
he cried to an officer,
<Q>lead the&s;e men to execution&mdash;Your rebellion,</Q>
continued he, addre&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf to St. Pierre,
<Q>your rebellion again&s;t me, the natural heir of your crown, is highly ag|gravated by your pre&s;ent pre&s;umption and af|front of my power.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>We have nothing to a&s;k of your Maje&s;ty,</Q>
&s;aid Eu&s;tace,
<Q>&s;ave what you cannot refu&s;e us.</Q>
&mdash;'What is that?'
<Q>Your e&s;teem, my lord,</Q>
&s;aid Eu&s;tace, and went out with his companions.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant, a &s;ound of triumph was heard throughout the camp. The queen had ju&s;t arriv|ed, with a powerful reinforcement of tho&s;e gallant &s;oldiers, at the head of whom &s;he had conquered Scotland, and taken their king captive.</P>
<P>Sir Walter Mauny flew to receive her Maje&s;ty, and briefly informed her of the particulars re&s;pect|ing the &s;ix victims.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="035333_0064_10022F36DC8719C0">As &s;oon as &s;he had been welcomed by Edward and his court, &s;he de&s;ired a private audience.
<Q>My lord,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he,
<Q>the que&s;tion I am to enter upon is not touching the lives of a few mechanics; it re&s;pects a matter more e&s;timable than the lives of all the natives of France; it re&s;pects the honour of the Engli&s;h nation, it re&s;pects the glory of my Edward, my hu&s;band, my king.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You think you have &s;entenced fix of your ene|mies to death. No, my lord, they have &s;en|tenced them&s;elves, and their execution would be the execution of their own orders, not the orders of Edward.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They have behaved them&s;elves worthily, they have behaved them&s;elves greatly; I cannot but re&s;pect, while I envy, while I hate them, for leav|ing us no &s;hare in the honour of this action, &s;ave that of granting a poor, an indi&s;pen&s;ible pardon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I admit they have de&s;erved every thing that is evil at your hands. They have proved the mo&s;t inveterate and efficacious of your enemies. They alone have with&s;tood the rapid cour&s;e of your conque&s;ts, and have withheld from you the crown to which you were born. Is it therefore that you would reward them? that you would gratify their de&s;ires, that you would indulge their ambi|tion, and enwreath them with everla&s;ting glory and applau&s;e?</Q></P>
<P><Q>But, if &s;uch a death would exalt mechanics over the fame of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious heroes, how would the name of my Edward, with all his tri|umphs and honours, be tarni&s;hed thereby! Would
<PB N="66" REF="035333_0065_10022F3945693930">
it not be &s;aid, that magnanimity and virtue are grown odious in the eyes of the monarch of Bri|tain? and the objects whom he de&s;tines to the puni&s;hment of felons, are the very men who de|&s;erve the prai&s;e and e&s;teem of mankind? The &s;tage on which they &s;hould &s;uffer would be to them a &s;tage of honour, but a &s;tage of &s;hame to Edward, a reproach to his conque&s;ts, a dark and indelible di&s;grace to his name.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, my lord. Let us rather di&s;appoint the &s;aucy ambition of the&s;e burghers, who wi&s;h to in|ve&s;t them&s;elves with glory at our expence. We cannot, indeed, wholly deprive them of the me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> of a &s;acrifice &s;o nobly intended, but we may cut them &s;hort of their de&s;ires: in the place of that death by which their glory would be con&s;um|mate, let us bury them under gifts, let us put them to &s;hame with prai&s;es; we &s;hall thereby de|feat them of that popular opinion, which never fails to attend tho&s;e who &s;uffer in the cau&s;e of virtue.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am convinced; you have prevailed; be it &s;o,</Q>
cried Edward,
<Q>prevent the execution; have them in&s;tantly before us!</Q></P>
<P>They came, when the queen, with an a&s;pect and accents diffu&s;ing &s;weetne&s;s, thus be&s;poke them:</P>
<P><Q>Natives of France, and the inhabitants of Ca|lais, ye have put us to va&s;t expence of blood and trea&s;ure in the recovery of our ju&s;t and natural inheritance; but you acted up to the be&s;t of an erroneous judgment, and we admire and honour in you that valour and virtue, by which we are &s;o long kept out of our rightful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="035333_0066_10022F3B927E6000">
<Q>You noble burghers, you excellent citizens! though you were tenfold the enemies of our per|&s;on and our throne, we can feel nothing on our part, &s;ave re&s;pect and affection for you. You have been &s;ufficiently te&s;ted, we loo&s;e your chains, we &s;natch you from the &s;caffold, and we thank you for that le&s;&s;on of humiliation, which you teach us, when you &s;hew that excellence is not of blood, of title, or &s;tation; that virtue gives a dig|nity &s;uperior to that of kings; and that tho&s;e, whom the Almighty informs with &s;entiments like your's, are ju&s;tly and eminently rai&s;ed above all human di&s;tinctions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are now free to depart to your kinsfolk, your countrymen, to all tho&s;e who&s;e lives and lib|erties you have &s;o nobly redeemed, provided you refu&s;e not to carry with you the due tokens of our e&s;teem.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yet, we would rather bind you to our&s;elves, by every endearing obligation; and for this pur|po&s;e, we offer to you your choice of the gifts and honours that Edward has to be&s;tow. Rivals for fame, but always friends to virtue, we wi&s;h that England were entitled to call you her &s;ons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, my country, (exclaimed Saint Pierre,) it is now that I tremble for you! Edward could only win your cities, but Philippa conquers hearts.</Q></P>
<P>'Brave Saint Pierre, (&s;aid the queen,) where|fore 'look you &s;o dejected?
<Q>Ah, madam! (re|plied St. Pierre,) when I meet with &s;uch another opportunity of dying, I &s;hall not regret that I &s;urvived this day.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CROMA. AN ANCIENT POEM FROM OSSIAN.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>If there be ought of pre&s;age in the mind,</L>
<L>This day will be remarkable in my life</L>
<L>By &s;ome great act, or of my days the la&s;t.</L></Q>

<P>IT was the voice of my love! &s;eldom art thou in the dreams of Malvina! Open your airy halls, fathers of To&s;car of &s;hields! Unfold the gates of your clouds: The &s;teps of Malvina are near. I have heard a voice in my dream. I feel the fluttering of my &s;oul. Why did&s;t thou come, O bla&s;t! from the dark rolling face of the lake? Thy ru&s;tling wing was in the tree; the dream of Malvina fled. But &s;he beheld her love, when his robe of mi&s;t flew on the wind. A &s;unbeam was on his &s;kirts; they glittered like the gold of the &s;tran|ger. It was the voice of my love; &s;eldom comes he to my dreams!</P>
<P>But thou dwelle&s;t in the &s;oul of Malvina, &s;on of mighty O&s;&s;ian! my &s;ighs ari&s;e with the beams of the Ea&s;t; my tears de&s;cend with the drops of night. I was a lovely tree, in thy pre&s;ence, O&s;car! with all my branches round me; but thy death came like a bla&s;t from the de&s;ert, and laid my green head
<PB N="75" REF="035333_0074_10022F55622D9688">
low. The Spring returned with its &s;howers; no leaf of mine aro&s;e! The virgins &s;aw me &s;ilent in the hall: they touched the harp of joy. The tear was on the cheek of Malvina; the virgins be|held me in my grief. Why art thou &s;ad, they &s;aid, thou fir&s;t of the maids of Lutha? Was he lovely as the beam of the morning, and &s;tately in thy &s;ight?</P>
<P>Plea&s;ant is thy &s;ong in O&s;&s;ian's ear, daughter of &s;treamy Lutha! Thou ha&s;t heard the mu&s;ic of de|parted bards, in the dream of thy re&s;t, when &s;leep fell on thine eyes, at the murmur of Moruth.&mdash; When thou did&s;t return from the chace, in the day of the Sun, thou ha&s;t heard the mu&s;ic of bards, and thy &s;ong is lovely. It is lovely, O Malvina! but it melts the &s;oul. There is a joy in grief, when peace dwells in the brea&s;t of the &s;ad. But &s;orrow wa&s;tes the mournful, O daughter of To&s;car; and their days are few! They fall away, like the flow|er on which the &s;un hath looked in his &s;trength, after the mildew has pa&s;&s;ed over it, when its head is heavy with the drops of the night. Attend to the tale of O&s;&s;ian, O maid! He remembers the days of his youth!</P>
<P>The King commanded; I rai&s;ed my &s;ails; and ru&s;hed into the bay of Croma; into Croma's &s;ounding bay, in lovely Inisfail. High on the coa&s;t aro&s;e the towers of Crothar, King of Spears; Crothar renowned in the battles of his youth; but age dwelt then around the chief. Rothmar had rai&s;ed the &s;word again&s;t the hero; and the wrath of Fingal burned. He &s;ent O&s;&s;ian to meet Roth|mar
<PB N="76" REF="035333_0075_10022F57AE358B48">
in war; for the Chief of Croma was the friend of his youth. I &s;ent the bard before me with &s;ongs. I came into the hall of Crothar. There &s;at the Chief amid&s;t the arms of his fathers; but his eyes had failed. His grey locks waved around a &s;taff, on which the warrior leaned. He hummed the &s;ongs of other times, when the &s;ound of our arms reached his ears. Crothar ro&s;e, &s;tretched his aged hand, and ble&s;&s;ed the &s;on of Fingal.</P>
<P>O&s;&s;ian! &s;aid the hero, the &s;trength of Crothar's arms has failed. O could I lift the &s;word as in the day that Fingal fought at Strutha! He was the fir&s;t of men! but Crothar had al&s;o his fame. The King of Morven prai&s;ed me; he placed on my arm the bo&s;&s;y &s;hield of Calthar, whom the King had &s;lain in his wars. Do&s;t thou not behold it on the wall, for Crothar's eyes have failed! Is thy &s;trength like thy father's, O&s;&s;ian? Let the aged feel thine arm!</P>
<P>I gave my arm to the King; he felt it with his aged hands; the &s;igh ro&s;e in his brea&s;t, and his tears came down. Thou art &s;trong, my &s;on, he &s;aid; but not like the King of Morven! but who is like the hero among the mighty in war! Let the fea&s;t of my hall be &s;pread; and let my bards exalt the &s;ong. Great is he that is within my walls, ye &s;ons of echoing Croma! The fea&s;t is &s;pread; the harp is heard; and joy is in the hall. But it was joy covering a &s;igh, that darkly dwelt in every brea&s;t. It was like the faint beam of the moon &s;pread on a cloud in heaven. At length the mu|&s;ic cea&s;ed; and the aged King of Croma &s;poke:
<PB N="77" REF="035333_0076_10022F5A018EBE20">
He &s;poke without a tear, but &s;orrow &s;welled in the mid&s;t of his voice.</P>
<P>Son of Fingal; beholde&s;t thou not the darkne&s;s of Crothar's joy? My &s;oul was not &s;ad at the fea&s;t, when my people lived before me. I rejoiced in the pre&s;ence of &s;trangers, when my &s;on &s;hone in the hall. But O&s;&s;ian, he is a beam that is departed. He left no &s;treak of light behind. He is fallen, &s;on of Fingal! in the wars of his father. Roth|mar, the chief of gra&s;&s;y Tromlo, heard that the&s;e eyes had failed; he heard that my arms were fixed in the hall, and the pride of his &s;oul aro&s;e! He came towards Croma; my people fell before him. I took my arms in my wrath; but what could &s;ightle&s;s Crothar do? My &s;teps were unequal; my grief was great. I wi&s;hed for days that were pa&s;t. Days! wherein I fought and won in the field of blood. My &s;on returned from the cha&s;e; the fair-haired Fovar-gormo. He had not lifted his &s;word in battle, for his arm was young. But the &s;oul of the youth was great; the fire of valour burned in his eyes. He &s;aw the di&s;ordered &s;teps of his fa|ther; and his &s;igh aro&s;e. King of Croma, he &s;aid; is it becau&s;e thou ha&s;t no &s;on? is it for the weakne&s;s of Favor-gormo's arm, that thy &s;ighs a|ri&s;e? I begin, my father, to feel my &s;trength. I have drawn the &s;word of my youth; and I have bent the bow. Let me meet this Rothmar, with the &s;ons of Croma: Let me meet him, O my fa|ther! I feel my burning &s;oul. And thou &s;halt meet him, I &s;aid, &s;on of the &s;ightle&s;s Crothar! But let others advance before thee, that I may hear
<PB N="78" REF="035333_0077_10022F5B92F7D5C0">
the tread of thy feet at thy return; for my eyes behold thee not, fair-haired Fovar-gormo!</P>
<P>He went; he met the foe; he fell. Rothmar advances to Croma. He, who flew my &s;on is near, with all his pointed &s;pears.</P>
<P>This is no time to fill the &s;hell, I replied; and took my &s;pear! My people &s;aw the fire of my eyes; they all ro&s;e around. Through night we &s;trode along the heath. Grey morning ro&s;e in the Ea&s;t. A green narrow vale appeared before us; nor wanting was it in green winding &s;treams. The dark ho&s;t of Rothmar are on its banks, with all their glittering arms. We fought along the vale. They fled. Rothmar &s;unk beneath my &s;word! Day had not de&s;cended in the We&s;t, when I brought his arms to Crothar. The aged hero felt them with his hands; and joy brightened over all his thoughts.</P>
<P>The people gather to the hall. The &s;hells of the fea&s;t are heard. Ten harps are &s;trung; five bards advance, and &s;ing by turns the prai&s;e of O&s;|&s;ian. They poured forth their burning &s;ouls; and the &s;tring an&s;wered to their voice. The joy of Croma was great; for peace returned to the land. The night came on with &s;ilence; the morn|ing returned with joy. No foe came in darkne&s;s, with his glittering &s;pear. The joy of Croma was great; for the gloomy Rothmar had fallen!</P>
<P>I rai&s;ed my voice for Fovar-gormo, when they laid the chief in earth. The aged Crothar was there, but his &s;igh was not heard. He &s;earched for the wound of his &s;on, and found it in his brea&s;t.
<PB N="79" REF="035333_0078_10022F5DDE71DA90">
Joy ro&s;e in the face of the aged. He came and &s;poke to O&s;&s;ian. King of Spears! he &s;aid; my &s;on has not fallen without his fame. The young warrior did not fly; but met death, as he went for|ward in his &s;trength. Happy are they, who die in youth, when their renown is heard! The feeble will not behold them in the hall, nor &s;mile at their trembling hands. Their memory &s;hall be honour|ed in &s;ong; the young tear of the virgin will fall: But the aged wither away by degrees; the fame of their youth, while yet they live, is all forgotten. They fall in &s;ecret. The &s;igh of their &s;on is not heard. Joy is around their tomb; the &s;tone of their fame is placed without a tear. Happy are they who die in youth, when their renown is a|round them.</P>

of gold and &s;ilver that glittered on the &s;ide-boards, the numerous di&s;hes, that covered the ta|bles, the number and gay liveries of the attend|ants, with the chivalric and &s;plendid attire of the gue&s;ts, united to form a &s;cene of magnificence, &s;uch as we may not hope to &s;ee in the&s;e degenerate days.</P>
<P>Of the Baron, the following adventure is relat|ed. One night having retired late from the ban|quet to his chamber, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his attendants, he was &s;urpri&s;ed by the appearance of a &s;tranger of a noble air, but of a &s;orrowful and dejected coun|tenance. Believing, that this per&s;on had been &s;e|creted in the apartment, &s;ince it appeared impo&s;|&s;ible he could have lately pa&s;&s;ed the anti-room, unob&s;erved by the pages in waiting, who would have prevented this intru&s;ion on their lord, the Baron, calling loudly for his people, drew his &s;word, which he had not yet taken from his &s;ide, and &s;tood upon his defence. The &s;tranger &s;lowly advancing, told him that there was nothing to fear; that he came with no ho&s;tile de&s;ign, but to communicate to him a terrible &s;ecret, which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to know.</P>
<P>The Baron, appea&s;ed by the courteous manners of the &s;tanger, after &s;urveying him for &s;ome time in &s;ilence, returned his &s;word into the &s;cabbard, and de&s;ired him to explain the means, by which he had obtained acce&s;s to the chamber, and the purpo&s;e of this extraordinary vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Without an&s;wering either of the&s;e enquiries, the &s;tranger &s;aid, that he could not then explain him|&s;elf,
<PB N="87" REF="035333_0086_10022F6F92436A40">
but that, if the Baron would follow him to the edge of the fore&s;t, at a &s;hort di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle walls, he would there convince him, that he had &s;omething of importance to di&s;clo&s;e.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al again alarmed the Baron, who could &s;carcely believe, that the &s;tranger meant to draw him to &s;o &s;olitary a &s;pot, at this hour of the night, without harbouring a de&s;ign again&s;t his life, and he refu&s;ed to go, ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that, if the &s;tranger's purpo&s;e was an hon|ourable one, he would not per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing to re|veal the occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it, in the apartment where they were.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke this, he viewed the &s;tranger &s;till more attentively than before, but ob&s;erved no change in his countenance, or any &s;ympton, that might intimate a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of evil de&s;ign. He was habited like a knight, was of a tall and maje&s;|tic &s;tature, and of dignified and courteous man|ners. Still, however, he refu&s;ed to communicate the &s;ubject of his errand in any place, but that he had mentioned, and, at the &s;ame time, gave hints concerning the &s;ecret he would di&s;clo&s;e, that awak|ened a degree of &s;olemn curio&s;ity in the Baron, which at length induced him to con&s;ent to follow the &s;tranger, on certain conditions.</P>
<P>'Sir Knight,' &s;aid he,
<Q>I will attend you to the fore&s;t, and will take with me only four of my people, who &s;hall witne&s;s our conference.</Q></P>
<P>To this, however, the Knight objected.</P>
<P>'What I would di&s;clo&s;e,' &s;aid he with &s;olemni|ty,
<Q>is to you alone. There are only three living
<PB N="88" REF="035333_0087_10022E8E2220C160">
per&s;ons, to whom the circum&s;tance is known; it is of more con&s;equence to you and your hou&s;e, than I &s;hall now explain. In future years you will look back to this night with &s;atisfaction or repentance, accordingly as you now determine. As you would hereafter pro&s;per&mdash;follow me; I pledge you the honour of a knight, that no evil &s;hall befal you;&mdash;if you are contented to dare futurity, remain in your chamber, and I will de|part as I came.</Q></P>
<P>'Sir Knight,' replied the Baron,
<Q>how is it po&s;|&s;ible, that my future peace can depend upon my pre&s;ent determination?</Q></P>
<P>'That is not now to be told,' &s;aid the &s;tranger,
<Q>I have explained my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t. It is late; if you follow me, it mu&s;t be quickly;&mdash;you will do well to con&s;ider the alternative.</Q></P>
<P>The Baron mu&s;ed, and, as he looked upon the knight, he perceived his countenance a&s;&s;ume a &s;in|gular &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>The Baron paced his apartment, for &s;ome time, impre&s;&s;ed by the la&s;t words of the &s;tranger, who&s;e extraordinary reque&s;t he feared to grant, and fear|ed al&s;o to refu&s;e. At length he &s;aid,
<Q>Sir Knight, you are utterly unknown to me; tell me your|&s;elf, is it rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould tru&s;t my&s;elf alone with a &s;tranger, at this hour, in a &s;olitary fore&s;t? Tell me, at lea&s;t, who you are, and who a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ecrete you in this chamber.</Q></P>
<P>The knight frowned at the&s;e latter words, and was a moment &s;ilent; then, with a countenance &s;omewhat &s;tern, he &s;aid,</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="035333_0088_10022F74291E0810">
<Q>I am an Engli&s;h knight; I am called Sir Be|vys of Lanca&s;ter&mdash;and my deeds are not un|known at the Holy City, whence I was returning to my native land, when I was benighted in the neighbouring fore&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>'Your name is not unknown to fame,' &s;aid the Baron, 'I have heard of it.' (The knight looked haughtily.)
<Q>But why, &s;ince my ca&s;tle is known to entertain all true knights, did not your herald announce you? Why did you not appear at the banquet, where your pre&s;ence would have been welcomed, in&s;tead of hiding your&s;elf in my ca&s;tle and &s;tealing to my chamber, at midnight!</Q></P>
<P>The Stranger frowned, and turned away in &s;i|lence; But the Baron repeated the que&s;tions.</P>
<P>'I come not,' &s;aid the knight,
<Q>to an&s;wer enqui|ries, but to reveal facts. If you would know more, follow me, and again I pledge the hon|our of a Knight, that you &s;hall return in &s;afety, Be quick in your determination&mdash;I mu&s;t be gone.</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome further he&s;itation, the Baron deter|mined to follow the &s;tranger, and to &s;ee the re&s;ult of his extraordinary reque&s;t; he therefore again drew forth his &s;word, and, taking up a lamp, bade the knight lead on. The latter obeyed, and open|ing the door of the chamber they pa&s;&s;ed into the anti-room, where the Baron, &s;urpri&s;ed to find all his pages a&s;leep, &s;topped, and, with ha&s;ty violence, was going to reprimand them for their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, when the knight waved his hand, and looked &s;o expre&s;&s;ively upon the Baron, that the latter re|&s;trained his re&s;entment and pa&s;&s;ed on.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="035333_0089_10022F7673DE03E0">The knight, having de&s;cended a &s;tairca&s;e, open|ed a &s;ecret door, which the Baron had believed was known only to him&s;elf, and, proceeding through &s;everal narrow and winding pa&s;&s;ages, came, at length, to a &s;mall gate, that opened beyond the walls of the ca&s;tle. Meanwhile the Baron followed in &s;ilence and amazement, on perceiving that the&s;e &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ages were &s;o well known to a &s;tranger, and felt inclined to return from an adventure, that appeared to partake of treachery, as well as dan|ger. Then con&s;idering that he was armed, and ob&s;erving the courteous and noble air of his con|ductor, his courage returned, he blu&s;hed, that it had failed him for a moment, and he re&s;olved to trace the my&s;tery to its &s;ource. He now found him&s;elf on the heathy platform, before his ca&s;tle, where, looking up, he perceived lights glimmering in the different ca&s;ements of the gue&s;ts, who were retiring to &s;leep; and while he &s;hivered in the bla&s;t, and looked on the dark and de&s;olate &s;cene around him, he thought of the comforts of his warm chamber, rendered cheerful by the blaze of wood, and felt, for a moment, the full contra&s;t of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The wind was &s;trong, and the Baron watched his lamp with anxiety, expecting every moment to &s;ee it extingui&s;hed; but, though the flame waver|ed, it did not expire, and he &s;till followed the &s;tran|ger, who often &s;ighed as he went, but did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>When they reached the borders of the fore&s;t, the knight turned and rai&s;ed his head, as if he
<PB N="91" REF="035333_0090_10022F78070DC558">
meant to addre&s;s the Baron, but then, clo&s;ing his lips in &s;ilence, he walked on.</P>
<P>As they entered beneath the dark and &s;preading bows, the Baron, affected by the &s;olemnity of the &s;cene, he&s;itated whether to proceed, and demand|ed how much further they were to go. The knight replied only by a ge&s;ture, and the Baron, with he&s;|itating &s;teps and a &s;u&s;picious eye, followed through an ob&s;cure and intricate path, till, having pro|ceeded a con&s;iderable way, he again demanded whither they were going, and refu&s;ed to proceed unle&s;s he was informed.</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he looked at his own &s;word, and at the knight alternately, who &s;hook his head, and who&s;e dejected countenance di&s;armed the Baron, for a moment, of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P><Q>A little further is the place, whither I would lead you,</Q>
&s;aid the &s;tranger;
<Q>no evil &s;hall befall you&mdash;I have &s;worn it on the honour of a knight.</Q></P>
<P>The Baron, rea&s;&s;ured, again followed in &s;ilence, and they &s;oon arrived at a deep rece&s;s of the fore&s;t, where the dark and lofty che&s;tnuts entirely exclud|ed the &s;ky, and which was &s;o overgrown with un|derwood, that they proceeded with difficulty.&mdash; The knight &s;ighed deeply as he pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ome|times pau&s;ed; and having at length reached a &s;pot, where the trees crowded into a knot, he turn|ed, and with a terrific look, pointing to the ground, the Baron &s;aw there the body of a man, &s;tretched at its length, and weltering in blood; a gha&s;tly wound was on the forehead, and death appeared already to have contracted the features.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="035333_0091_10022F7BE8D4F8F0">The Baron, on perceiving the &s;pectacle, &s;tarted in horrour, looked at the knight for explanation, and was then going to rai&s;e the body, and examine if there were yet any remains of life; but the &s;tran|ger, waving his hand, fixed upon him a look &s;o earne&s;t and mournful, as not only much &s;urpri&s;ed him, but made him de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But what were the Baron's emotions, when, on holding the lamp near the features of the corp&s;e, he di&s;covered the exact re&s;emblance of the &s;tranger his conductor, to whom he now looked up in a&s;ton|i&s;hment and enquiry? As he gazed, he perceived the countenance of the knight change and begin to fade, till his whole form gradually vani&s;hed from his a&s;toni&s;hed &s;en&s;e! While the Baron &s;tood fixed to the &s;pot, a voice was heard to utter the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>The body of Sir Bevys of Lanca&s;ter, a noble Knight of England, lies before you. He was, this night, waylaid and murdered, as he journeyed from the Holy City towards his native land. Re&s;pect the honour of knighthood and the law of human|ity; inter the body in Chri&s;tian ground, and cau&s;e his murderers to be puni&s;hed. As you ob&s;erve, or neglect this, &s;hall peace and happine&s;s, or war and mi&s;ery, light upon you and your hou&s;e forever!</Q></P>
<P>The Baron, when he recovered from the awe and a&s;toni&s;hment, into which this adventure had thrown him, returned to his ca&s;tle, whither he cau&s;ed the body of Sir Bevys to be removed; and, on the following day, it was interred, with the honours of knighthood, in the chapel of the ca&s;tle, attended by all the noble knights and ladies, who graced the court of the Baron St. Brunne.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TOWARDS the latter end of the reign of Henry VIII. Sir Gawen, a man of &s;ome fortune and con&s;iderable curio&s;ity, fond of enter|pri&s;e, and in&s;atiate of knowledge, travelled through the northern counties of England. The follow|ing &s;ingle adventure is &s;till extant among the fam|ily writings, and is &s;till recorded by his po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="035333_0101_10022F7993572430">It was towards &s;un-&s;et, (&s;aith the manu&s;cript) when Sir Gawen, after having traver&s;ed a very lone and unfrequented path, arrived at the edge of a thick and dark fore&s;t; the &s;ky was &s;uddenly over|ca&s;t, and it began to rain, the thunder rolled at a di&s;tance, and &s;heets of livid lightning fla&s;hed acro&s;s the heath. Overcome with fatigue and hunger, he rode impatiently along the borders of the fore&s;t, in hopes of di&s;covering an entrance, but none was to be found. At length, ju&s;t as he was about to di&s;mount, with an intention of breaking the fence, he di&s;cerned as he thought, &s;omething moving up|on the heath, and, upon advancing towards it, it proved to be an old woman gathering peat, and who, overtaken by the &s;torm, was hurrying home as fa&s;t as her infirm limbs would carry her.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of a human creature filled the heart of Sir Gawen with joy, and ha&s;tily riding up, he enquired how far he had deviated from the right road, and where he could procure a night's lodg|ing. The old woman now &s;lowly lifted up her pal&s;ied head, and di&s;covered a &s;et of features, which could &s;carcely be called human; her eyes were red, piercing, and di&s;torted, and, rolling horribly, glancing upon every object but the perform by whom &s;he was addre&s;&s;ed, and, at intervals, they omitted a fiery di&s;agreeable light; her hair, of a dirty grey, hung matted with filth in large ma&s;&s;es upon her &s;houlders, and a few thin portions ru&s;hed abrupt and horizontally from the upper part of her fore|head, which was much wrinkled, and of a parch|ment hue; her cheeks were hollow, withered, and
<PB N="103" REF="035333_0102_10022F628C683560">
red with a quantity of acrid rheum; her no&s;e was large, prominent and &s;harp, her lips thin, &s;kinny and livid, her few teeth black, and her chin long and peaked, with a number of bu&s;hy hairs depend|ing from its extremity; her nails al&s;o were acute, crooked and bent over her fingers, and her gar|ments ragged and fluttering in the wind, di&s;played every po&s;&s;ible variety of colour. The knight was a little daunted, but the old woman having men|tioned a dwelling at &s;ome di&s;tance, and offering to lead the way, the plea&s;ure received from this piece of news effaced the former impre&s;&s;ion, and getting from his hor&s;e, he laid hold of the bridle, and they &s;lowly moved over the heath.</P>
<P>The &s;torm had now cea&s;ed, and the moon ri&s;ing gave pre&s;age of a fine night, ju&s;t as the old woman, taking a &s;udden turn, plunged into the wood by a path narrow and almo&s;t choaked up with a quan|tity of briar and thorn. The trees were thick, and &s;ave a few glimp&s;es of the moon, which now and then poured light on the uncouth features of his companion, all was dark and di&s;mal; the heart of Sir Gawen mi&s;gave him; neither &s;poke, and the knight pur&s;ued his guide merely by the noi&s;e &s;he made in hurrying through the bu&s;hes, which was done with a celerity totally incon&s;i&s;tent with her former decrepitude. At length the path grew wider, and a faint blue light, which came from a building at &s;ome di&s;tance, glimmered before them; they now left the wood, and i&s;&s;ued upon a rocky and uneven piece of ground; the moon &s;truggling through a cloud, ca&s;t a doubtful and uncertain
<PB N="104" REF="035333_0103_10022F4B29AEA398">
light, and the old woman, with a leer, which made the very hair of Sir Gawen &s;tand an end, told him that the dwelling was at hand. It was &s;o; for a Gothic ca&s;tle, placed on a con&s;iderable elevation, now came in view; it was a large ma&s;&s;y &s;tructure, much decayed, and &s;ome parts of it in a totally ruinous condition; a portion, however, of the keep, or great tower, was &s;till entire, as was al&s;o the entrance to the court or inclo&s;ure, pre&s;erved probably by the ivy, who&s;e fibres crept round with &s;olicitous care. Large fragments of the ruin were &s;cattered about, covered with mo&s;s, and half &s;unk in the ground, and a number of old elm trees, through who&s;e foliage the wind &s;ighed with a &s;ul|len and melancholy &s;ound, dropped a deep and &s;ettled gloom, that &s;carce permitted the moon to &s;tream by fits upon the building.</P>
<P>Sir Gawen drew near; ardent curio&s;ity, min|gled with awe, dilated his bo&s;om, and he inwardly congratulated him&s;elf upon &s;o &s;ingular an adven|ture, when turning round to que&s;tion his compan|ion, a glimp&s;e of the moon poured full upon his eye &s;o horrid a contexture of feature, &s;o wild and preternatural a combination, that, &s;mote with ter|rour and unable to move, a cold &s;weat trickled from every pore, and immediately this infernal being, &s;eizing him by the arm, and hurrying him over the draw-bridge to the great entrance of the keep, the portcullis fell with a tremendous &s;ound, and the knight, &s;tarting as it were from a trance, drew his &s;word in act to de&s;troy his treacherous guide, when in&s;tantly a horrible and infernal laugh
<PB N="105" REF="035333_0104_10022F42B3281D78">
bur&s;t from her, and in a moment the whole ca&s;tle was in an uproar, peal after peal i&s;&s;uing from eve|ry quarter, till at length growing faint, they died away, and a dead &s;ilence en&s;ued.</P>
<P>Sir Gawen, who, during this &s;trange tumult, had collected all his &s;cattered powers, now looked round him with determined re&s;olution; his terri|ble companion had di&s;appeared, and the moon &s;hining full upon the portcullis, convinced him that any e&s;cape that way was impracticable; the wind &s;ighed through the elms; the &s;cared owl, ut|tering his di&s;cordant note, broke from the ru&s;tling bough, and a dim twinkling light beamed from a loop-hole near the &s;ummit of the great tower. Sir Gawen entered the keep, having previou&s;ly rea&s;oned him&s;elf into a &s;tate of cool fortitude, and bent up every power to the appalling enterpri&s;e. He extended his &s;word before him, for it was dark, and proceeded carefully to &s;earch around, in hopes either of di&s;covering &s;ome aperture, which might lead to the ve&s;tibule or &s;tairca&s;e, or of wreaking his vengeance on the wretch, who had thus decoy|ed him. All was &s;till as death: but as he &s;trode over the floor, a dull, hollow &s;ound i&s;&s;ued from beneath, and rendered him apprehen&s;ive of falling through into &s;ome di&s;mal vault, from which he might never be able to extricate him&s;elf. In this &s;ituation, dreading the effect of each light foot&s;tep, a &s;ound, as of many people whi&s;pering, &s;truck his ear; he bent forward li&s;tening with eager attention, and as it &s;eemed to proceed from a little di&s;tance before him, he determined to follow it: he did &s;o,
<PB N="106" REF="035333_0105_100230EFCF0CE3D8">
and in&s;tantly fell through the mouldering pave|ment, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time peals of horrid laughter again bur&s;t with reiterated clamour from every chamber of the ca&s;tle. Sir Gawen ro&s;e with con&s;iderable difficulty, and much &s;tunned with the fall, although fortunately the &s;pot he had dropped upon was covered with a quantity of damp and &s;oft earth, which gave way to his weight. He now found him&s;elf in a large vault, arched in the Gothic manner, and &s;upported by eight ma&s;&s;y pillars, down who&s;e &s;ides the damp moi&s;ture ran in cold and heavy drops, the moon &s;hining with great lu&s;tre through three iron-grated windows, which, al|though ru&s;ty with age, were &s;trong enough to re|&s;i&s;t the efforts of Sir Gawen, who, after having in vain tried to force them, looked around for his &s;word, which during the fall had &s;tarted from his gra&s;p, and in &s;earching the ground with his fingers, he laid hold of, and drew forth the fre&s;h bones of an enormous &s;keleton, yet grea&s;y and moi&s;t from the decaying fibres: he trembled with horror&mdash; a cold wind bru&s;hed violently along the &s;urface of the vault, and a ponderous iron door, &s;lowly grating on its hinges, opened at one corner, and di&s;clo&s;ed to the wandering eye of Sir Gawen a broken &s;tair|ca&s;e, down who&s;e &s;teps a blue and faint light fla&s;h|ed by fits, like the lightning of a &s;ummer's eve. Appalled by the&s;e dreadful prodigies, Sir Gawen felt, in &s;pite of all his re&s;olution, a cold and death|like chill pervade his frame, and kneeling down, he prayed fervently to that power, without who&s;e mandate no being is let loo&s;e upon another, and
<PB N="107" REF="035333_0106_1001FE55ED41B568">
feeling him&s;elf more calm and re&s;olved, he again began to &s;earch for his &s;word, when a moonbeam falling on the blade, at once re&s;tored it to its own|er.</P>
<P>Sir Gawen having thus re&s;umed his wonted for|titude and re&s;olution, held a parley with him&s;elf, and perceiving no other way by which he could e&s;cape, boldly re&s;olved to brave all the terrors of the &s;tairca&s;e, and, once more recommending him|&s;elf to his Maker, began to a&s;cend. The light &s;till fla&s;hed, enabling him to climb tho&s;e parts which were not broken or decayed. He had proceeded in this manner a con&s;iderable way, mounting, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, to the &s;ummit of the keep, when &s;ud|denly a &s;hrill and agonizing &s;hriek i&s;&s;ued from the upper part of it, and &s;omething rudely bru&s;hing down, gra&s;ped him with tremendous &s;trength; in a moment he became motionle&s;s, cold as ice, and felt him&s;elf hurried back by &s;ome irre&s;i&s;tible being; but ju&s;t as he had reached the vault, a &s;pectre of &s;o dreadful a &s;hape &s;talked by within it, that &s;training every mu&s;cle, he &s;prang from the deadly gra&s;p: the iron door ru&s;hed in thunder upon its hinges, and a deep hollow groan re&s;ounded from beneath. No &s;ooner had the door clo&s;ed, than yelling &s;creams and &s;ounds, which almo&s;t &s;u&s;pended the very pul&s;e of life, i&s;&s;ued from the vault, as if a troop of helli&s;h furies, with their chains united, were da&s;hing them in writhing frenzy, and howling to the uproar. Sir Gawen &s;tood petrified with horror, a &s;tony fear ran to his very heart, and di&s;mayed every &s;en&s;e about him; he &s;tared wide with his long locks up|&s;tanding
<PB N="108" REF="035333_0107_100230E02FC7C7F0">
&s;tiffly, and the throbbing of his heart op|pre&s;&s;ed him. The tumult at length &s;ub&s;iding, Sir Gawen recovered &s;ome portion of &s;trength, which he immediately made u&s;e of to convey him&s;elf as far as po&s;&s;ible from the iron door, and pre&s;ently reaching his former elevation on the &s;tairca&s;e, which, after a&s;cending a few more &s;teps, termin|ated in a winding gallery. The light, which had hitherto fla&s;hed ince&s;&s;antly, now di&s;appeared, and he was left in almo&s;t total darkne&s;s, except that now and then the moon threw a few cool rays through &s;ome broken loop-holes, heightening the horrour of the &s;cene. He dreaded going forward, and fearfully looked back, le&s;t &s;ome yelling fiend &s;hould again plunge him into the vault. He &s;tood &s;u&s;pended with apprehen&s;ion; a mournful wind howled through the apartments of the ca&s;tle, and li&s;tening, he thought he heard the iron door grate upon its hinges; he &s;tarted with terrour, the &s;weat &s;tood in big drops upon his forehead, his knees &s;mote each other, and he ru&s;hed forward with de&s;perate de&s;|pair, till having &s;uddenly turned a corner of the gallery, a taper, burning with a faint light, gleam|ed through a narrow dark pa&s;&s;age: Sir Gawen approached the light; it came from an exten&s;ive room, the folding doors of which were wide open: he entered; a &s;mall taper in a ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver candle|&s;tick &s;tood upon a table in the middle of the room, but gave &s;o incon&s;iderable an illumination, that the one end was wrapped in palpable dark|ne&s;s, and the other &s;carcely broken in upon by a dim light, that &s;treamed through a large ramified
<PB N="109" REF="035333_0108_100230DC3128D6C0">
window, covered with thick ivy. An arm-chair, &s;hattered and damp with age, was placed near the table, and the remains of a recent fire were &s;till vi&s;ible in the grate. The wain&s;cot, of black oak, had formerly been hung with tape&s;try, and &s;everal portions &s;till clung to tho&s;e parts, which were near the fire; they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome vivacity of teint, and with much gilding, yet apparent on the chimney-piece, and &s;everal mouldering reliques of co&s;tly frames and paintings, gave indi&s;putable evidence of the ancient grandeur of the place.</P>
<P>Sir Gawen clo&s;ed the folding doors, and, taking the taper, was about to &s;urvey the room, when a deep hollow groan from the dark end of it &s;mote cold upon his heart; at the &s;ame time the &s;ound, as of &s;omething falling with a dead weight, echo|ed through the room. Sir Gawen replaced the taper, the flame of which was agitated, now quiv|ering, &s;unk, now &s;treaming, flamed aloft, and as the la&s;t pale portion died away, the &s;carce di&s;tin|gui&s;hed form of &s;ome terrific being floated &s;lowly by, and again another dreadful groan ran deepen|ing through the gloom. Sir Gawen &s;tood for &s;ome time incapable of motion, at length &s;um|moning all his fortitude, he advanced with his &s;word extended to the darke&s;t part of the room: in&s;tantly bur&s;t forth in fierce irradiations a blue &s;ulphureous &s;plendour, and the mangled body of a man di&s;torted with the agony of death, his very fibres racked with convul&s;ion, his beard and hair &s;tiff and matted with blood, his mouth open, and his eyes protruding from their marble &s;ockets,
<PB N="110" REF="035333_0109_100230CFAF58D598">
ru&s;hed on the fixed and maddening &s;en&s;es of Sir Gawen, who&s;e heart had beat no more, had not a hi&s;s, as of ten thou&s;and fiends, loud, horrible, rou&s;ed him from the dreadful &s;cene; he &s;tarted, uttering a wild &s;hriek, his brain turned round, and running he knew not whither, bur&s;t through the folding doors.</P>
<P>Darkne&s;s again &s;pread her &s;able pall over the unfortunate Sir Gawen, and he hurried along the narrow pa&s;&s;age with a feeble and faultering &s;tep. His intellect &s;hook, and, overwhelmed with the late appalling objects, had not yet recovered any degree of recollection, and as he wandered in a dream, a confu&s;ed train of horrible ideas pa&s;&s;ing unconnected through his mind: at length, howe|ver, memory re&s;umed her function, re&s;umed it but to daunt him with harrowing &s;ugge&s;tions; the direful horrors of the room behind, and of the vault below, were &s;till pre&s;ent to his eyes, and as a man whom helli&s;h fiends had frightened, he &s;tood trem|bling, pale, and &s;taring wild.</P>
<P>All was now &s;ilent and dark, and he determin|ed to wait in this &s;pot the dawn of day; but a few minutes had &s;carce elap&s;ed, when the iron door, &s;creaming on its hinges, bellowed through the murmuring ruin. Sir Gawen nearly fainted at the &s;ound, which pau&s;ing for &s;ome time, again &s;welled upon the wind, and at la&s;t died away in &s;hrill mel|ancholy &s;hrieks; again all was &s;ilent, and again the &s;ame fearful noi&s;e &s;truck terrour to his &s;oul. Whil&s;t he was thus agitated with horrour and ap|prehen&s;ion, a dim light &s;treaming from behind, ac|companied
<PB N="111" REF="035333_0110_1001FE511140D6F0">
with a &s;oft, quick, and hollow tread, convinced Sir Gawen that &s;omething was pur&s;uing him, and &s;truck with wildering fear, he ru&s;hed un|con&s;cious down the &s;teps; the vault received him, and its portal &s;winging to their clo&s;e, &s;ounded as the &s;entence of death. A dun, faetid &s;moke filled the place, in the centre of which aro&s;e a faint and bickering flame. Sir Gawen approached and be|held a cor&s;e &s;u&s;pended over it by the neck, its fat dropped, and a flame fla&s;hing through the vault, gleamed on a throng of hideous and gha&s;tly fea|tures, that now came forward through the &s;moke. Sir Gawen, with the de&s;perate valour of a man, who &s;ees de&s;truction before him, ran furious for|ward; an univer&s;al &s;hriek bur&s;t forth; the cor&s;e dropped into the fire, which ri&s;ing with tenfold brilliance, placed full in view the dreadful form of his infernal guide, dilated into horrour it&s;elf; her face was as pale as death, her eyes were wide o|pen, dead and fixed, a horrible grin &s;at upon her features; her lips black, and half putrid, were drawn back, di&s;clo&s;ing a &s;et of large blue teeth, and her hair, &s;tanding &s;tiffly erect, was of a with|ered red. Sir Gawen felt his blood freeze within him, his limbs forgot to move, the face, enlarging as it came, drew near, and, &s;wooning, he fell for|ward on the ground.</P>
<P>Slow pa&s;&s;ed the vital fluid through the bo&s;om of Sir Gawen, &s;carce did the heart vibrate to its impul&s;e; on his pallid forehead &s;at a chilly &s;weat and frequent &s;pa&s;ms &s;hook his limbs; but at length returning warmth gave &s;ome vigour to his
<PB N="112" REF="035333_0111_100230B6BAB76710">
frame, the energy of life became more &s;uffu&s;ed, a &s;oothing languor &s;tole upon him, and on opening his eyes, ru&s;hed neither the images of death or the rites of witchcraft, but the &s;oft, the &s;weet and tranquil &s;cenery of a &s;ummer's moon-light night. Enraptured with this &s;udden and unexpected change, Sir Gawen ro&s;e gently from off the ground, over his head towered a large and maje&s;tic oak, at who&s;e foot, by &s;ome kind and compa&s;&s;ionate being he concluded he had been laid. Delight and gratitude dilated his heart, and advancing from beneath the tree, who&s;e gigantic branches &s;pread a large extent of &s;hade, a vale, beautiful and romantic, through which ran a clear and deep &s;tream, came full in view; he walked to the edge of the water, the moon &s;hone with mellow lu&s;tre on its &s;urface, and its banks fringed with &s;hrubs, breathed a perfume more delicate than the odours of the Ea&s;t. On one &s;ide, the ground, covered with a vivid, &s;oft, and downy verdure &s;tretched for a con&s;iderable extent to the borders of a large for|e&s;t, which &s;weeping round, finally clo&s;ed up the valley, on the other, it was broken into abrupt and rocky ma&s;&s;es &s;warded with mo&s;s, and from who&s;e clefts grew thick and &s;preading trees, the roots of which, wa&s;hed by many a fall of water, hung bare and matted from their craggy beds.</P>
<P>Sir Gawen forgot in this delicious vale, all his former &s;ufferings, and giving up his mind to the plea&s;ing influence of curio&s;ity and wonder, he de|termined to explore the place by tracing the wind|ings of the &s;tream. Scarce had he entered upon
<PB N="113" REF="035333_0112_100230B2DBCF1848">
this plan, when mu&s;ic of the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing &s;weet|ne&s;s filled the air, &s;ometimes it &s;eemed to float a|long the valley, &s;ometimes it &s;tole along the &s;ur|face of the water, now it died away among the woods, and now with deep and mellow &s;ymphony it &s;welled upon the gale. Fixed in a&s;toni&s;hment, Sir Gawen &s;carce ventured to breathe; every &s;en&s;e, &s;ave that of hearing, &s;eemed quite ab&s;orbed, and when the la&s;t faint warblings melted on his ear, he &s;tarted from the &s;pot, &s;olicitous to know from what being tho&s;e more than human &s;trains had parted; but nothing appeared in view; the moon full and unclouded, &s;hone with unu&s;ual lu&s;|tre, the white rocks glittered in her beam, and, fil|led with hope, he again pur&s;ued the windings of the water, which conducting to the narrowe&s;t part of the valley, continued their cour&s;e through the wood. Sir Gawen entered by a path, &s;mooth, but narrow and perplexed, where, although its branch|es were &s;o numerous that no preference could be given, or any direct route long per&s;i&s;ted in, yet every turn pre&s;ented &s;omething to amu&s;e&punc; &s;ome|thing to &s;harpen the edge of re&s;earch. The beau|ty of the trees, through who&s;e inter&s;tices the moon gleamed in the mo&s;t picture&s;que manner: the glimp&s;es of the water, and the notes of the night|ingale, who now began to fill the valley with her &s;ong, were more than &s;ufficient to take off the &s;en&s;e of fatigue, and he wandered on &s;till eager to explore, &s;till panting for further di&s;covery. The wood now became more thick and ob&s;cure, and at length almo&s;t dark, when the path taking &s;udden|ly
<PB N="114" REF="035333_0113_1001FE49008F3428">
an oblique direction, Sir Gawen found him&s;elf on the edge of a circular lawn, who&s;e teint and &s;oftne&s;s were beyond compare, and which &s;eemed to have been lightly bru&s;hed by fairy feet. A number of fine old trees, around who&s;e boles crept the ivy and the woodbine, ro&s;e at irregular di&s;|tances, here they mingled into groves, and there &s;eparate, and emulous of each other, they &s;hook their airy &s;ummits in di&s;dain. The water, which had been for &s;ome time concealed, now murmur|ed through a thou&s;and beds and vi&s;iting each lit|tle flower, added vigour to its vegetation, and poignancy to its fragrance. Along the edges of the wood and beneath the &s;hadows of the trees, an innumerable ho&s;t of glow-worms lighted their in|ocuous fires, lu&s;trous as the gems of Golconda, and Sir Gawen, de&s;irous yet longer to enjoy the &s;cene, went forward with light foot&s;teps on the lawn; all was calm, and, except the breeze of night, that &s;ighed &s;oft and &s;weetly through a world of leaves, a perfect &s;ilence prevailed. Not many minutes, however, had elap&s;ed, before the &s;ame enchanting mu&s;ic, to which he had li&s;tened with &s;o much rap|ture in the vale, again arre&s;ted his ear, and pre&s;ent|ly he di&s;covered on the border of the lawn, ju&s;t ri&s;ing above the wood, and floating on the bo&s;om of the air, a being of the mo&s;t delicate form; from his &s;houlders &s;treamed a tunic of the tendere&s;t blue, his wings and feet were clothed in downy &s;ilver, and in his gra&s;p he had a wand, white as the mountain &s;now. He ro&s;e &s;wiftly in the air, his brilliance became exce&s;&s;ive from the lunar rays, his

&s;ong echoed through the vault of night, but having quickly dimini&s;hed to the &s;ize and appearance of the evening &s;tar, it died away, and the next mo|ment he was lo&s;t in aether. Sir Gawen &s;till fixed his eye on that part of the heavens, where the vi&s;|ion had di&s;appeared, and &s;hortly had the plea&s;ure of again &s;eeing the &s;tar-like radiance, which in an in&s;tant unfolded it&s;elf into the full and fine dimen|&s;ions of the beauteous being, who having collected dew from the cold vales of Saturn, now de&s;cended rapidly towards the earth, and waving his wand, as he pa&s;&s;ed athwart the woods, a number of like form and garb, flew round him, and all alighting on the lawn, &s;eparated at equal di&s;tances on its cir|cumference, and then &s;haking their wings, which &s;pread a perfume through the air, bur&s;t into one general &s;ong. Sir Gawen, who apprehen&s;ive of being di&s;covered, had retreated within the &s;hadow of &s;ome mo&s;&s;y oaks, now waited with eager expec|tation the event of &s;o &s;ingular a &s;cene. In a few moments a bevy of elegant nymphs, dancing two by two, i&s;&s;ued from the wood on the right, and an equal number of warlike knights, accompanied by a band of min&s;trels, from that of the left. The knights were clothed in green; on their bo&s;oms &s;hone a plate of burni&s;hed &s;teel, and in their hands they gra&s;ped a golden targe and lance of beamy lu&s;tre. The nymphs, who&s;e form and &s;ymmetry were beyond whatever poets dream, were dre&s;&s;ed in robes of white, their zones were azure, dropt with diamonds, and their light brown hair decked with ro&s;es hung in ample ringlets. So quick, &s;o
<PB N="116" REF="035333_0115_100230A334AF7128">
light and airy was their motion, that the turf, the flowers &s;hrunk not to the gentle pre&s;&s;ure, and each &s;miling on her favourite knight, he &s;lung his bril|liant arms a&s;ide, and mingled in the dance.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t thus they flew in rapid mea&s;ures over the lawn. Sir Gawen, forgetting his &s;ituation, and im|patient to &s;alute the a&s;&s;embly, involuntarily &s;tepped forward, and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly a &s;hrill and hollow gu&s;t of wind murmured through the woods, the moon dipt into a cloud, and the knights, the dames and aerial &s;pirits vani&s;hed from his view, leaving the amazed Sir Gawen to repent at lei&s;ure of his precipitate intru&s;ion; &s;carce, however, had he time to determine what he &s;hould pur&s;ue, when a gleam of light fla&s;hed &s;uddenly along the horizon, and the beauteous being, whom he fir&s;t beheld in the air, &s;tood before him; he waved his &s;nowy wand, and pointing to the wood, which now appeared &s;parkling with a thou&s;and fires, moved gently on. Sir Gawen felt an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e which com|pelled him to follow, and having penetrated the wood, he perceived many bright rays of light, which, darting like the beams of the &s;un, through every part of it, mo&s;t beautifully illuminated the &s;hafts of the trees. As they advanced forwards the radiance became more inten&s;e and converged towards the centre; and the fairy being turning quickly round, commanded Sir Gawen to kneel down and having &s;queezed the juice of an herb into his eyes, bade him now proceed, but that no mortal eye, unle&s;s its powers of vi&s;ion were increa&s;|ed, could endure the glory that would &s;hortly bur&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="035333_0116_100230A0E6DAC700">
upon them. Scarce had he uttered the&s;e words, when they entered an amphitheatre; In its centre was a throne of ivory inlaid with &s;apphires, on which &s;at a female form of exqui&s;ite beauty, a plain coro|net of gold obliquely cro&s;&s;ed her flowing hair, and her robe of white &s;attin hung negligent in ample folds. Around her &s;tood five and twenty nymphs clothed in white and gold, and holding lighted ta|pers; beyond the&s;e were fifty of the aerial beings, their wings of downy &s;ilver &s;tretched for flight, and each a burning taper in his hand; and la&s;tly, on the circumference of the amphitheatre &s;hone one hundred knights in mail of tempered &s;teel, in one hand they &s;hook aloft a large targe of ma&s;&s;y dia|mond, and in the other fla&s;hed a taper. So exce&s;|&s;ive was the reflection, that the targes had the lu&s;tre of a hundred &s;uns, and when &s;haken, &s;ent forth &s;creams of vivid lightning; from the gold, the &s;il|ver, and the &s;apphires ru&s;hed a flood of tinted light, that mingling, threw upon the eye a &s;eries of re|volving hues.</P>
<P>Sir Gawen impre&s;&s;ed with awe, with wonder and delight, fell pro&s;trate on the ground, whil&s;t the fairy &s;pirit advancing, knelt and pre&s;ented to the queen a chry&s;tal va&s;e. She ro&s;e, &s;he waved her hand, and &s;miling, bade Sir Gawen to ap|proach. 'Gentle &s;tranger,' &s;he exclaimed,
<Q>let not fear appal thine heart for to him, whom cour|age, truth and piety have di&s;tingui&s;hed, our friend&s;hip and our love is given. Spirits of the ble&s;t we are, our &s;weet employment is to befriend the wretched and the weary, to lull the torture of
<PB N="118" REF="035333_0117_1002309B6FB37CA0">
angui&s;h, and the horrour of de&s;pair. Ah! never &s;hall the tear of innocence or the plaint of &s;orrow, the pang of injured merit, or the &s;igh of hopele&s;s love, implore our aid in vain. Upon the moon|beam do we float, and light as air, pervade the habitations of men, and hearken, O favoured mor|tal! I tell thee, &s;pirits pure from vice are pre&s;ent to thy inmo&s;t thoughts; when terrour and when madne&s;s, when &s;pectres and when death &s;urround|ed thee, our influence put to flight the mini&s;ters of darkne&s;s; we placed thee in the moon-light vale, and now upon thy head I pour the planetary dew, from Hecate's dread agents, it will free thee from wildering fear and gloomy &s;uper&s;tition.</Q></P>
<P>She ended, and Sir Gawen, impatient to ex|pre&s;s his gratitude, was about to &s;peak, when &s;ud|denly the light turned pale, and died away, the &s;pirits fled, and mu&s;ick &s;oft and &s;weet was heard remotely in the air. Sir Gawen &s;tarted, and in place of the refulgent &s;cene of magic, he beheld a public road, his hor&s;e cropping the gra&s;s, which grew upon its edge, and a village at a little di&s;|tance, on who&s;e &s;pire the ri&s;ing &s;un had &s;hed his earlie&s;t beams.</P>

<HEAD>THE CAVE OF MODRED. A BRITISH STORY.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the all conquering &s;word of the Romans had penetrated into the Southern part of Wales, and en&s;anguined the ho&s;tile plain with the blood of her mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed heroes, Mo|dred, the &s;age, &s;ought a retreat from the de&s;olating rage of war; he was a Druid, renowned for his piety and wi&s;dom; yet he had lived to &s;ee the ho|ly altar be&s;prinkled with the blood of its prie&s;ts, and the &s;acred groves polluted by the crimes of a licentious &s;oldiery!</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="035333_0126_10023070386489E8">The a&s;ylum he cho&s;e was a &s;pacious cave, divid|ed by the hand of nature into a variety of apart|ments: an ob&s;cure path led to it by a gentle de&s;|cent, and by a variety of intricate windings &s;eemed to pronounce it inacce&s;&s;ible, but to tho&s;e whom the friendly hand of the Druid guided: thus &s;eque&s;|tered, it formed a retreat for innocence and virtue.</P>
<P>Here the tender virgin fled to e&s;cape violation, and the mode&s;t matron in&s;ult; and here the wid|ow and the fatherle&s;s &s;ought protection and con&s;o|lation, here too the hardy veteran, covered with wounds, oftimes repaired from the battle, and healed by the &s;age's pious care, returned with re|newed &s;trength and vigour to the fight. Every morn and eve, Modred was &s;een pro&s;trate beneath a venerable grove of oak, which graced the &s;ide of a hill, that ro&s;e at a &s;mall di&s;tance from his habita|tion; there he erected the &s;acred altar, and agree|ably to the cu&s;tom of his revered ance&s;tors, laid on it the &s;acred oblation of meal. Thus pa&s;&s;ed his days in prayer, contemplation, and acts of benevo|lence. His drink was from a clear &s;treamlet, that di&s;tilled from the rock, out of which his rude dwel|ling was formed, and his food &s;alubrious herbs, which grew within the precincts of his habitation.&mdash; Such was Modred, the Druid; in whom the &s;im|plicity of childhood, and the wi&s;dom of old age, were ob&s;erved to unite.</P>
<P>One day having wandered beyond the bounds he u&s;ually pre&s;cribed him&s;elf, in pur&s;uit of me|dicinal herbs, he ob&s;erved the ground to be di&s;tain|ed with &s;everal drops of blood, and perceiving, a
<PB N="128" REF="035333_0127_10023069365C5DD8">
few paces further, that it widened into a tract of con&s;iderable dimen&s;ions, his humanity prompted him to follow it. It led him to a &s;pot of ground, on which a per&s;on in armour lay extended; he ap|peared to be in a &s;woon, and his beaver being up, Modred could di&s;cern that he was in the flower of his age.</P>
<P>The Druid perceived by his armour, that he be|longed to the Roman army; but compa&s;&s;ion for the helple&s;s &s;tate in which he beheld him, cau&s;ed him, at that in&s;tant, to forget all animo&s;ity; he rai&s;ed him in his arms, and applied a &s;overeign cordial, that he always carried about him, to his lips, a few drops of which greatly revived him, but he was neverthele&s;s &s;o extremely exhau&s;ted from lo&s;s of blood, that he in vain attempted to ri&s;e up|on his feet. Modred, finding the &s;tranger incapa|ble of ri&s;ing, without other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than he was able to give, ha&s;tened back to the cavern, and re|turned with all &s;peed, accompanied by O&s;car:&mdash; O&s;car was the mo&s;t valiant of all the Briti&s;h youths, who fearle&s;s lifted the &s;word in defence of liberty. His courage had been manife&s;t in many battles, which he had &s;ought with the common enemy, and it was united with clemency and genero&s;ity. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this youth, the &s;tranger was &s;up|ported to Modred's cavern; but as he was a Ro|man, they fir&s;t took the precaution to blind-fold him, le&s;t, being an enemy, he &s;hould make ob&s;erva|tions relative to the &s;ituation of the place, which might hereafter prove to their di&s;advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="035333_0128_100230630DE76AF0">Having conducted him into the cavern, they took the bandage from his eyes, unbraced his armour, and laid him on a couch of the &s;ofte&s;t mo&s;s; the Druid then examined his wounds, which he found by care might &s;peedily be healed, and applying to them &s;ome herbs, which he knew to be of the mo&s;t &s;overeign efficacy, left him awhile to his repo&s;e. An hour being elap&s;ed, he renewed his vi&s;it, and found the &s;tranger &s;o much recovered by the reme|dies applied to his wounds, together with a gentle &s;leep, from which, on Modred's entrance he awoke, that he was able, in a faint voice, to enquire into who&s;e hands he had fallen; but pre&s;ently recollect|ing they were Britons, he te&s;tified by his counte|nance, that he expected little mercy at their hands.</P>
<P>The Druid, gue&s;&s;ing at what pa&s;&s;ed in his mind, endeavoured to di&s;pel his apprehen&s;ions: 'Youth,' &s;aid he,
<Q>you are in the hands of tho&s;e, whom your nation calls barbarians, but though &s;trangers to the &s;pecious arts u&s;ed by civilized nations to glo&s;s over the ba&s;e&s;t de&s;igns, the Britons are not unacquainted with the virtues of ho&s;pitality and humanity. They love victory, but they delight not in blood; di&s;pel your fears, therefore, and re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that while you remain in the cave of Modred, the Druid, you &s;hall be &s;ecure from dan|ger or in&s;ult.</Q></P>
<P>In the morning, the Druid found his gue&s;t wonderfully recovered; who informed him, that he was an officer in the Roman army; that he had left the camp, which was &s;tationed within a day's march of that place, in company with five
<PB N="130" REF="035333_0129_1002305E7253D5B8">
other of the troop; their de&s;ign being, he confe&s;|&s;ed, to make di&s;coveries concerning the &s;tate of the enemy; but his men being, as he imagined, &s;ub|orned by a brother officer, between whom and him&s;elf, there had been &s;ome trifling difference, they had ba&s;ely turned their arms again&s;t him, and left him for dead on the &s;pot, where the Druid fir&s;t di&s;covered him. He expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t acknowledgements for the kind treatment he had received, and, at Modred's reque&s;t, followed him to the outward part of the cave, where a number of per&s;ons, of different &s;ex and age, were a&s;&s;em|bled, being that morning returned from &s;acri|fice.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, the &s;uperiour beauty of the fair El&s;imena, arre&s;ted the attention of the young Ro|man. Her &s;tature aro&s;e con&s;iderably above her companions, and, like her features, was formed with the mo&s;t exact &s;ymmetry; a thou&s;and beau|ties played round her mouth; her cheek di&s;clo&s;ed a tincture pure as the opening ro&s;e; and her hair floated over her &s;houlders, in all the wild negli|gence of nature. From the playful hours of in|fancy, El&s;imena had known no other parent, than Modred; to his care, a mother's dying breath had bequeathed her, and the pious &s;age religiou&s;ly di&s;|charged the &s;acred tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. He watched over her with the attention and care of a fond parent, and received from El&s;imena the grate|ful return of filial tenderne&s;s and obedience. O&s;car had long re&s;igned his heart at the &s;hrine of El&s;ime|na's beauty, nor was the fair maid in&s;en&s;ible of his
<PB N="131" REF="035333_0130_10023058056009A0">
merit; on the contrary, O&s;car beheld her affections captive; &s;he burned with an equal flame, and a &s;hort period was to &s;ee them united.</P>
<P>O&s;car, not without unea&s;ine&s;s, beheld his mi&s;tre&s;s expo&s;ed to the rapturous gaze of the young Roman; he ob&s;erved that her charms touched his &s;oul; and feared his noble mien and gallant deportment might cau&s;e El&s;imena to draw between them a compari&s;on not to his own advantage; but the&s;e mode&s;t apprehen&s;ions were di&s;&s;ipated, when he ob|&s;erved the coolne&s;s and re&s;erve with which &s;he repli|ed to his civilities; and how &s;olicitous &s;he was to di&s;engage her&s;elf from his conver&s;ation. Claudius, for that was the name of the Roman, became eve|ry moment more enamoured of El&s;imena; in the &s;imple attire of a Briti&s;h maid, his heart confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he eclip&s;ed the faire&s;t Roman; but he had the mortification to find that &s;he was in&s;en&s;ible to every thing he could urge in behalf of his pa&s;&s;ion, and that her heart was &s;olely devoted to O&s;car.</P>
<P>Three days in&s;en&s;ibly glided away, which the enamoured Claudius, happy in the pre&s;ence of El|&s;imena, thought no more than as many hours; but the Druid finding him re&s;tored to his former vigour, reminded him that it was time to depart: 'We have now,' &s;aid Modred,
<Q>di&s;charged the debt, which humanity exacted from us, in your behalf; we have received you beneath our roof, and the &s;acred laws of ho&s;pitality, which we re|vere, forbid us to exert to your di&s;advantage, that power which we derive not from the &s;trength of our arms, or the chance of war, but by the pri|vate
<PB N="132" REF="035333_0131_100230511396F038">
calamity of our enemy; but now that you no longer claim our &s;ufference, it is time that you depart, &s;ince we can no longer entertain you but as the enemy of our country, the ba&s;e en|&s;laver of our rights and liberties: as &s;uch, a Brit|on cannot, without reproach, hold amicable con|ver&s;e with you.</Q></P>
<P>The young Roman expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the Druid's genero&s;ity, and lamented that he was con&s;trained to bear arms again&s;t a country to which he was indebted for his life, and, what was &s;till dearer, his liberty.</P>
<P>While Claudius thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, the Dru|id tied a bandage over his eyes, in the &s;ame man|ner, as when he fir&s;t brought him to the cave, and then, with a genero&s;ity &s;carcely to be paralleled, con&s;igned him to the care of O&s;car, who waited to conduct him in &s;afety to the place where they found him.</P>
<P>During the time that Claudius was entertained in the cave of Modred, the Britons having received intelligence that the Romans were on their march to attack them, were making great preparations for a vigorous defence: on the third day, the ar|mies encamped within &s;ight of each other, and on the morning of the fourth, were drawn up in order for battle.</P>
<P>El&s;imena having, with an aching heart, receiv|ed the farewell of her beloved O&s;car, retired to the pious Druid, who, beneath the covert of a con&s;e|crated grove, (which, as it &s;tood on a ri&s;ing ground, commanded a di&s;tant view of the plain, where the
<PB N="133" REF="035333_0132_1001FE3DE9626BE0">
two armies were to engage) offered &s;acrifice to the gods for the &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms.</P>
<P>The two armies engaged with equal fury, and for a long time it was doubtful on which &s;ide vic|tory would terminate: El&s;imena, from the con|fines of the grove, beheld her lover ru&s;h into the mid&s;t of the battle, with a courage and re&s;olution truly heroic; but when he leaped from the chariot to engage the enemy &s;word in hand, &s;he &s;tretched her aching eyes in vain, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the croud of gallant heroes, who united again&s;t the common foe.</P>
<P>The fight was long and de&s;perate, but the &s;upe|riour number of the Romans at length prevailed; the flower of the warlike Silures were &s;lain, or tak|en pri&s;oners, and the re&s;t obliged to &s;ave them|&s;elves by flight.</P>
<P>El&s;imena anxiou&s;ly enquired of the Britons, who fled toward the hills for &s;helter from the victorious enemy, concerning her lover, and with angui&s;h heard the gallant youth had fallen among the &s;lain; frantic with grief, &s;he &s;natched a &s;word from one of them: 'How! my brave countrymen,' &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>will you &s;uffer the gallant heroes, who fought with you this day, in defence of our liberties, to fall unrevenged? For my part, I am re&s;olved to fell my life dearly, and not till I have my&s;elf had the con&s;olation of a dying &s;word in the blood of our enemies.</Q>
Saying thus, like an arrow from a bow, &s;he de&s;cended the hill, and urged on by de&s;pair, ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the enemy, who had now gained the foot of it, in pur&s;uit of the fly|ing
<PB N="134" REF="035333_0133_1002304ADE351010">
Britons, re&s;olving, if &s;he could not revenge the death of her lover, at lea&s;t to peri&s;h in the attempt.</P>
<P>The Britons, animated by the conduct of El&s;i|mena, once more faced the enemy; a&s;hamed of being &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in courage by a woman, they at|tacked them with redoubled fury, and though the &s;uperiour numbers of the latter rendered all hope of victory abortive, to the great lo&s;s of the Ro|mans, they fought till either they were &s;lain, or made pri&s;oners. The Druid was, in the mean while, not an inactive &s;pectator of this &s;cene; ani|mated with a glorious enthu&s;ia&s;m, he &s;eized the reins of a chariot, and vaulting into the &s;eat, drove, with a de&s;perate fury, into the mid&s;t of the fight, cutting down all before him, and repeatedly di&s;charging darts upon the enemy, till, overpower|ed by numbers, he was con&s;trained to yield him|&s;elf their pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>But to return again to our fair heroine; urged on by de&s;pair, &s;he attempted to rid her&s;elf of a life, which, &s;ince O&s;car was &s;lain, could no longer af|ford her plea&s;ure; But Claudius, the young Ro|man, who had been entertained by the Druid, for|tunately ob&s;erved her, and made a &s;ign to his men, to &s;urround and convey her pri&s;oner to his tent; which was accordingly done, notwith&s;tanding her efforts to prevent it, by endeavouring to put an end to her exi&s;tence: but what was the exce&s;s of her joy, when in the tent, to which &s;he was con|ducted by the Roman troops, &s;he beheld her belov|ed O&s;car! He was reclined on a &s;uperb &s;opha, and from the wounds, which he had received in battle,
<PB N="135" REF="035333_0134_1002304700CE92D0">
was extremely weak and faint; &s;o that the un|expected &s;ight of his mi&s;tre&s;s a pri&s;oner, and in the tent of his rival, rai&s;ed in his brea&s;t &s;uch violent emotions, that they were nearly fatal to him. Nor was El&s;imena le&s;s agitated to behold her lover, contrary to her expectations, alive; yet a pri&s;oner and apparently on the brink of the grave. She &s;unk at his feet in a &s;woon, out of which it was &s;ome time before &s;he was recovered by the attend|ants, who, by the orders of their ma&s;ter, treated her with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect and attention; but what afterwards contributed greatly to her recov|ery was, to find from the &s;urgeon, who had exa|mined the wounds of her lover, that they were not mortal.</P>
<P>El&s;imena having, at the reque&s;t of O&s;car, in|formed him by what means &s;he fell into the hands of the enemy, was in return acquainted by him, that &s;he was in the tent of the &s;tranger, who had &s;ojourned with them in the Druid's cave; who, he had learned, was &s;on to the Roman General; he al&s;o informed her, that it was entirely owing to the humanity of Claudius, he owed his life.
<Q>O|verpowered,</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q>by the enemy, I &s;unk down covered with wounds, and faint with lo&s;s of blood, when the generous Roman ha&s;tily ad|vanced to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; his own &s;oldiers bore me to this tent, where I have been treated with a re&s;|pect, rather due to the victor than the vanqui&s;h|ed. Thus has he rendered me his debtor for a life, which mu&s;t, in future, prove a burthen to me.</Q></P>

<P>Little more pa&s;&s;ed at that time, Claudius being &s;ummoned to the tent of his father; who, having in the action been &s;lightly wounded by a javelin, had ordered enquiry to be made among the pri&s;on|ers for the Briton, who threw it; and further to aid the di&s;covery, had offered life and freedom to the owner. The next day the javelin was expo&s;ed, in the tent of the Roman General, but as the Brit|ons fought, for the mo&s;t part, with darts and &s;words, few appeared to review it, much le&s;s to own it.</P>
<P>News, however, was at length brought to the General, that one of the pri&s;oners confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be the man, who threw it. The Roman com|mander ordered him to be brought into his pre&s;|ence, and having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his attendants, a&s;ked him many que&s;tions concerning the manner in which he came by it. 'Sir,' &s;aid Modred, (for it was in truth that venerable &s;age)
<Q>it once belong|ed to a fair unfortunate, who has long &s;ince de&s;|cended to the du&s;t.</Q>
The General, who&s;e curi|o&s;ity was excited by this reply, reque&s;ted, with emotion, to know further particulars; which the Druid thus proceeded to relate.
<Q>When Aulus Di|dius,</Q>

<PB N="138" REF="035333_0137_1002303E4F77EA48">
of the Roman forces; Ethelda, the daugh|ter of a gallant warrior, who has &s;ince fallen in defence of our liberties, was made captive by a young commander, who led a numerous legion again&s;t our nation. The conqueror, &s;truck with her beauty, and re&s;pecting her misfortunes, &s;trove to lighten her captivity by the mo&s;t generous treatment; but, alas! in &s;o doing, he impo&s;ed on her more la&s;ting chains. She no longer view|ed him but with the eyes of love, and a pa&s;&s;ion, too &s;trong to be era&s;ed by time, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart. The young conqueror, as I before ob|&s;erved, was not in&s;en&s;ible of her charms; but E|thelda knew too well what was due to her birth and &s;ex to yield on di&s;honourable terms; &s;he re|pelled the &s;olicitation of her lover with a firmne&s;s that at once awed and increa&s;ed his flame. Con|vinced of her merit, he at length offered her his hand, which the fair captive had not power to refu&s;e. That very hour, &s;he became his wife; but a final &s;eparation, in a &s;hort time after, took place. On their march to join the Roman Gen|eral, they were &s;urpri&s;ed by a body of our troops; led on by the father of Ethelda, they routed the enemy and re&s;cued the pri&s;oners, which were tak|en in the former &s;kirmi&s;h. Ethelda, from a ri&s;ing ground, beheld the conte&s;t with inconceivable horrour; not knowing for the &s;ucce&s;s of which to direct her prayers to Heaven; the liberties, and perhaps the lives, of her father and country|men, depending on the one &s;ide, and, on the oth|er, tho&s;e of the man, for whom &s;he had en&s;trang|ed her&s;elf from both.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="035333_0138_1002303A717CB380">
<Q>The engagement was ob&s;tinate and bloody, but victory was on the point of terminating in favour of our arms, when the Romans were re|lieved by a troop of hor&s;e; but not before the unfortunate Ethelda had &s;een both her father and her hu&s;band fall.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This reinforcement of the Romans threw the Britons into confu&s;ion; they fled with precipita|tion, and e&s;caped the &s;word of the enemy under covert of the night. Ethelda fled, not knowing whither, till her &s;trength failing, &s;he &s;unk down at the door of a poor widow, who received her into the humble dwelling, and &s;et before her &s;ome refre&s;hment; but it was two days before &s;he could be prevailed upon either to eat or &s;peak; after this, &s;he became more calm, and related to the good woman the calamities, that had befal|len her and cau&s;ed her grief; &s;he al&s;o declared it as her determination, never more to unite with &s;ociety, and joyfully accepted the poor widow's offer of abiding in her cottage, and partaking the &s;mall comforts her humble lot afforded. Ethel|da died two years after, having fir&s;t given birth to a female infant.</Q></P>
<P>'I had often,' continued Modred,
<Q>ob&s;erved her at our Holy Sacrifices, where &s;he con&s;tantly ap|peared covered with a veil, which totally con|concealed her per&s;on from the eyes of men; cu|rio&s;ity prompted me to enquire into her &s;tory, which I learned fir&s;t from the woman, at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he &s;ojourned, and afterwards from Ethel|da her&s;elf; for it is nece&s;&s;ary, Sir, to inform you,
<PB N="140" REF="035333_0139_100230374E30CC18">
that although animated by the glorious cau&s;e of liberty, I for once ventured to rai&s;e the ho&s;tile &s;word in defence of my country, my office is to &s;peak comfort to the afflicted, to utter divine my&s;teries, and to recommend univer&s;al peace and concord to mankind; being, to be plain, of the &s;acred order of Druids.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My office gave me free acce&s;s to Ethelda, who readily made me the confident of her misfortunes, and with her la&s;t breath, recommended her infant daughter to my protection. On her death, I took the little li&s;per home to my abode; and when the fury of war forced me to &s;eek &s;helter in the&s;e mountains, &s;he was the companion of my flight, and for eighteen years has been the &s;olace of my declining age; but, alas! my El&s;imena is either numbered among the dead, or mu&s;t wa&s;te her blooming years in an irk&s;ome captivity.</Q></P>
<P>The Roman commander a&s;ked, with an emotion that cau&s;ed Modred to &s;u&s;pect he was prompted by other motives, than mere curio&s;ity, in his enquiries, what were his rea&s;ons for &s;uppo&s;ing, that the daugh|ter of Ethelda was either numbered among the dead, or a captive. The &s;age then informed him of all that he knew concerning El&s;imena; how, on being told her lover had fallen in the battle, &s;he ru&s;hed, &s;word in hand, into the mid&s;t of the enemy; how, by the intrepidity of her conduct, the flying troops were in&s;pired with courage once more to face the enemy, and to revenge the death of their brave companions; and la&s;tly, that it had been rumoured &s;he was a pri&s;oner in the tent of Claudi|us,

the General's &s;on. Then reverting to the for|mer part of his di&s;cour&s;e, 'That javelin, my lord,' &s;aid he,
<Q>with which it was my fortune to wound you, the wretched mother of El&s;imena, previous to the fatal engagement, which bereft her of all &s;he held dear, concealed in her garments, for the purpo&s;e of putting an end to her exi&s;tence, &s;hould &s;he live to &s;ee either her parent or hu&s;band &s;lain. But that Almighty Power, who permitted her affliction, endued her with fortitude to bear it. The weapon once belonged to her hu&s;band, and in her exile &s;he pre&s;erved it as a precious relic &s;a|cred to his remembrance. On her death, it fell into my hand; &s;ince which, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, I have kept it as belonging to one, in who&s;e mi&s;|fortunes I was deeply intere&s;ted.</Q></P>
<P>'Ye&s;terday,' continued Modred,
<Q>in&s;tigated by an impul&s;e, for which I cannot account, I armed my&s;elf with it; and, when in&s;pired by the exam|ple of my brave countrymen, I a&s;cended the war|like chariot, re&s;olving to yield up my life in de|fence of our liberties, having expended my darts, as a la&s;t effort, I threw the javelin.</Q></P>
<P>'Wonderful and my&s;terious,' &s;aid the Roman,

<Q>can it really be &s;o?</Q></P>
<P>'I fell, indeed,' &s;aid the General,

the field of battle, and a &s;hort time re&s;tored me to my former vigour; but my blooming bride was forever lo&s;t. I cau&s;ed &s;trict &s;earch to be made after her, but all was in vain; &s;ince, till this day, I could never obtain the lea&s;t tidings of her. The javelin, with which I was ye&s;terday wounded, I remembered once to have been mine, it having, for &s;everal ages, been handed down in our family from father to &s;on, as a relic of anti|quity. I recollected the period when I lo&s;t it, and thought it might have been thrown by a Briton, who had fought in that engagement, which for|ever &s;eparated me from Ethelda; methought it might lead to a di&s;covery of her, or at lea&s;t in|form me concerning the manner of her death. This, venerable Modred, was the cau&s;e of my enquiry, and Heaven doubtle&s;s in&s;pired me with the thought, that it might re&s;tore to me the pledge of my Ethelda's love.</Q></P>
<P>While this di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;&s;ed between the Roman commander and the venerable Druid, a &s;cene near|ly as intere&s;ting was acting in the tent of Claudius.

<P>'Generous O&s;car,' &s;aid Claudius, 'it is time to convince you, that ingratitude does not form a part of the Roman character; abide with us, gal|lant youth, enrol your&s;elf among the friends of

<P>'Claudius,' &s;aid the youth,
<Q>a Briton's heart mu&s;t &s;peak in his countenance; for the lives and liberties of his friends, O&s;car offers you the return of a grateful heart; but, for his own, Claudius, can he offer thanks for life and freedom, when robbed of all that can render either de&s;irable?</Q></P>
<P>'O&s;car,' &s;aid the young Roman,
<Q>I under&s;tand you; this fair maid is the object, to which we both a&s;pire; we both love El&s;imena, and the happine&s;s of one (&s;o &s;ay our pa&s;&s;ions) <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be founded on the de&s;pair of the other.

You po&s;&s;e&s;s the heart of El&s;imena; fortune has given me a right over her per&s;on, but it is a right which I &s;corn to avail my&s;elf of. Take her, gallant youth, receive the fair El&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">mena, even

from the hand of thy rival, and henceforth re|member that the Romans fight, not to tyrannize over and en&s;lave, but to civilize mankind.</Q>
Say|ing this, he took the hand of El&s;imena, and united it with that of her beloved O&s;car.</P>
<P>The joy of both was, for &s;ome minutes, ab&s;orb|ed in admiration; that Claudius, in the ardour of youth, when the affections are unu&s;ed to yield to the curb of rea&s;on, in the height of pro&s;perity, which is &s;o &s;eldom tempered by moderation, &s;hould thus nobly &s;quare his conduct by the mo&s;t rigid rules of virtue; thus nobly yield up the object of his love into the arms of another, &s;truck them with an awe, which, for &s;ome moments, deprived them of utterance. They threw them&s;elves at the feet of Claudius, who having once made the pain|ful &s;acrifice, experienced from it a &s;atisfaction, in|finitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that which any &s;en&s;ual gratifica|tion could have be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Affairs were in this po&s;ture, when a me&s;&s;age ar|rived from the General, reque&s;ting the attendance of his &s;on, and the two pri&s;oners, who were en|tertained in his tent. For, upon enquiry, he had learned that they were really El&s;imena and O&s;car.</P>
<P>Claudius, who &s;uppo&s;ed his father's &s;ummons to proceed merely from a curio&s;ity to &s;ee and honour tho&s;e, to whom he was indebted for the life and liberty of his &s;on, immediately proceeded with them to his tent. When they entered, they were inexpre&s;&s;ibly delighted to find the venerable Dru|id; who, in his turn, received no le&s;s joy at be|holding the young pair. He pre&s;ented El&s;imena
<PB N="145" REF="035333_0144_100230292A5A3D48">
to the Roman commander, who embraced her with a warmth truly parental, and with delight &s;carcely to be equalled, viewed the beauties of her form, promi&s;ing a mind equally noble and perfect.</P>
<P>Claudius and the young Britons, as the reader will conclude, were at a lo&s;s to comprehend the cau&s;e of this &s;eemingly my&s;terious behaviour, till they were informed of it by Modred; who, at the reque&s;t of the General, related to them the partic|ulars of Ethelda's &s;tory. El&s;imena then threw her&s;elf at the feet of her &s;ire, to te&s;tify her entire obedience to his will. The pa&s;&s;ion, which Claudi|us lately entertained for her per&s;on, was now chan|ged into brotherly love; he embraced her with the tendere&s;t and pure&s;t affection, and rejoiced &s;in|cerely in having gained &s;o charming a &s;i&s;ter. Joy was diffu&s;ed over every countenance, excepting that of O&s;car, who greatly feared El&s;imena was once more on the point of being &s;natched from his arms; but his fears vani&s;hed, when, at the reque&s;t of his &s;on, the Roman commander joined his hand with that of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Such was the joy, which pervaded the brea&s;t of the noble Roman, on receiving to his arms &s;o lovely an image of his lo&s;t Ethelda, and &s;uch was his gratitude to the venerable Druid, who had for &s;o many years cheri&s;hed and protected her, and, to whom he was be&s;ide indebted for the life of his &s;on, that he promi&s;ed to grant him whatever he &s;hould a&s;k in favour of his countrymen. Modred availed him&s;elf of this generous offer, by reque&s;ting the lives and liberties of all, who had, the day before,
<PB N="146" REF="035333_0145_100230246C6C7B78">
been made pri&s;oners; which was accordingly granted.</P>
<P>Through the influence of the Druid, El&s;imena and Claudius, an honourable and advantageous peace was &s;oon concluded between the Romans and the warlike Britons, who inhabited that part of the country.</P>
<P>The eyes of the venerable Druid were, in a good old age, clo&s;ed by his beloved El&s;imena; who, with O&s;car, lived a &s;eries of years in uninterrupted peace and happine&s;s.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SIR Reginald de Cuthbert, a noble knight who had long fought valiantly under the banners of the Holy Cro&s;s, when the armies were going to retire to their re&s;pective quarters for the winter, applied to the general for leave to return home. Crowned with glory, and arrayed with honour, Sir Reginald &s;ought retirement in the land of his fathers; intending to dedicate the remainder of his days to the &s;ervice of his God, in defence of who&s;e name he had &s;o often engaged in the hor|ror of battle.</P>
<P>The many perilous adventures the knight en|countered on his way from the Holy Land, we find not recorded in hi&s;tory, until his arrival at the borders of a dreary fore&s;t on the confines of Ger|many. The twilight was &s;preading over the hem|i&s;phere, when Sir Reginald entered what at fir&s;t
<PB N="168" REF="035333_0167_10022FE198C06148">
appeared to him a &s;mall wood, which he now found extended it&s;elf by degrees into an immen&s;e and almo&s;t impenetrable fore&s;t. The knight prick|ed forward with great impatience, till the &s;hades of night, which fell heavily over the fore&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure arre&s;ted his progre&s;s; the narrow winding path grew more and more intricate; the clouds, which &s;eemed charged with thunder, pa&s;&s;ed &s;low|ly along the heavens; the wind now aro&s;e and whi&s;tled hollow through the branches, the rain began to rattle amid&s;t the trees, and a tremendous &s;torm &s;eemed to be fa&s;t approaching, while the darkne&s;s of night &s;urrounded him with all its hor|rors.</P>
<P>At length, overcome with fatigue and impeded by the bu&s;hes and underwood, the knight alighted from his hor&s;e, and threw him&s;elf upon the ground; but &s;oon aro&s;e, and &s;ecuring his tru&s;ty &s;teed, walked &s;lowly onward in hopes of finding &s;ome &s;olitary cottage, which might afford him &s;helter from the 'pelting of the pitile&s;s &s;torm.' Ere the knight had mea&s;ured many paces, he perceived a light, which, from its lofty &s;ituation, at fir&s;t appeared to his deluded eye a brilliant &s;tar; he was, however, &s;oon undeceived, and joy reani|mated his drooping &s;pirits, in a few moments he found him&s;elf at the gate of a ca&s;tle. The knight knocked violently at the ca&s;tle gate.
<Q>Who is there?</Q>
&s;ome body; whom he could not &s;ee, &s;narl|led with a rough voice from above.
<Q>In the name of all the ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints,</Q>
exclaimed Sir Reginald,
<Q>I conjure you to open quickly the gate to a trav|eller,
<PB N="169" REF="035333_0168_10022FDDB0906750">
who ha&s;t lo&s;t his way in the fore&s;t, and is piteou&s;ly beaten by the tempe&s;t.</Q>
No an&s;wer was returned, but the gate was opened by an un&s;een hand. The entrance was &s;till and gloomy as the grave. The knight groped his way through the dark. 'Come!' roared the &s;ame rough voice he had heard before; at the &s;ame time, a hand, cold as ice, pulled him along. Sir Reginald &s;huddered violently, and was going to retire, when the gate was &s;hut after him with a thundering noi&s;e.</P>
<P>Perceiving that all retreat was cut off, he bade defiance to his fate, and re&s;olved to meet the wor&s;t as a man. After advancing a few paces, the icy hand was drawn back. The knight &s;topped to wait till it &s;hould again lay hold of him, and lead him farther; but waited in vain; he groped a|round, expecting to find his guide, whom he fancied to be near, but he was gone. Not a foot&s;tep or the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;ound was heard through the whole building. Not a &s;ingle ray of light broke through the di&s;mal darkne&s;s, which &s;urrounded him, yet he proceeded with extended arms and ad|vanced about thirty &s;teps, when &s;omething im|peded his pa&s;&s;age, he endeavoured to examine it with his hand, but it &s;eemed &s;uddenly to &s;tart back; he once more &s;tretched out his hand, and felt a heap of &s;kulls and bones. Horror and a chilly tremor &s;hook his whole frame. The awful &s;till|ne&s;s, which &s;urrounded him, was &s;till uninter|rupted.</P>
<P>The knight was fixed to the ground, wildly &s;tar|ing through the impenetrable darkne&s;s. At length
<PB N="170" REF="035333_0169_10022FD6CEC9FAF0">
a hollow broken &s;ound was heard, which &s;eemed at a great di&s;tance. After a long pau&s;e, it vibrated in his ear a &s;econd time. The idea that he had nothing more to lo&s;e, and that every means of ef|fecting an e&s;cape from that re&s;idence of horror was cut off, entirely &s;ubdued his fear, and prompted him to follow that &s;ound. A few paces brought him to a &s;tone &s;tairca&s;e. Having de&s;cended five &s;teps, a doleful groan &s;eemed to proceed from a room not far di&s;tant. The knight advanced &s;low|ly, and with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection, mu&s;ing on his perilous &s;ituation, when at once he felt the pa&s;|&s;age ob&s;tructed by a door, which opened without difficulty. The room to which it led was al&s;o a re&s;idence of darkne&s;s and di&s;mal &s;ilence. The knight was re&s;olved to enter it boldly. Fortu|nately he examined the entrance with his foot, before he proceeded, and found with un&s;peakable horror, that it was bottomle&s;s. The hollow di&s;mal &s;ound again &s;truck his ear from a &s;mall di&s;tance. He &s;huddered violently, and &s;taggered onward. Every thing was now lonely and &s;ilent all around; at length he came to a &s;econd &s;tairca&s;e, a&s;cended &s;even &s;teps, and then de&s;cended as many, when his eyes &s;uddenly beheld a faint glimmer of light, which &s;eemed to emerge from below, at a great di&s;tance. Coming nearer, the knight ob&s;erved that he was &s;tanding on the brink of a deep aby&s;s, from which the glimmer broke forth. An old half rotten &s;tairca&s;e led down; he however re&s;olv|ed to ri&s;k every thing, and pulling off his &s;hoes to avoid making a noi&s;e, began to de&s;cend. When
<PB N="171" REF="035333_0170_1001FE1F34259048">
he came to the eighth &s;tep, the hollow &s;ound was again repeated: the knight &s;topped a moment, and then went on with returning courage. When he had reached the middle, the light &s;uddenly di&s;|appeared, and impenetrable darkne&s;s &s;urrounded him once more. He &s;topped to con&s;ider what could be done, when a &s;tone got loo&s;e beneath his feet, and rolled down with a thundering noi&s;e a|gain&s;t the door of the vault.
<Q>Who di&s;turbs my re&s;t?</Q>
the hollow, well known voice exclaimed. Sir Reginald was rivetted to the ground in dread expectation; terror &s;ealed his lips. The door of the vault opened &s;lowly, and a pale white figure appeared, with a candle in one hand. It advanc|ed two &s;teps, lifted up one hand in a menacing manner, and di&s;appeared. The &s;ight of this dreadful apparition almo&s;t petrified him on the &s;pot, his &s;en&s;es &s;eemed to for&s;ake him, and the blood congealed within his veins.</P>
<P>The knight having recovered a little the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es, with difficulty regained the top of the &s;teps, and from thence perceived a pa&s;&s;age quite different from the other, and following it he arriv|ed at the foot of a &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e. He a&s;cended many &s;teps, at length a partition impeded him, he pu&s;hed forcibly again&s;t it with his right hand, and &s;hivered a gla&s;s pane into a thou&s;and pieces. 'Who is there?' a rough voice exclaimed. At the &s;ame time a door opened, and a mo&s;t alarming di&s;cour&s;e filled the knight with di&s;mal apprehen|&s;ions. 'Have you &s;harpened the knife?' one of the talkers a&s;ked. 'Yes, it is bright and &s;harp,'
<PB N="172" REF="035333_0171_10022FD091A8C468">
replied another voice,
<Q>his blood &s;hall flow abund|antly.</Q>
With the&s;e words the door bur&s;t open. Horror and de&s;pair now winged Sir Reginald's &s;teps. He flew down the &s;tairca&s;e, and had &s;carce|ly reached the bottom, when he was &s;uddenly &s;eized by the ice-cold hand, which he had felt on his entrance in that abode of terror. Here the knight's &s;en&s;es fled, and he dropped down in a &s;woon.</P>
<P>When Sir Reginald opened his eyes, he found him&s;elf in a &s;plendid room, lying at his ea&s;e on a &s;uperb bed, and a girl with two &s;ervants &s;itting by the bed-&s;ide, chaffing his temples. 'Where am I?' were the fir&s;t &s;ounds he uttered. They a&s;&s;ured him, he was in good hands; on enquiring to whom the ca&s;tle belonged, he was informed it was the property of the Lady Counte&s;s of Darbis, who would &s;ee him in the morning. An excellent &s;up|per was &s;oon after placed on the table, and the &s;ervants retired after he had fini&s;hed his meal.</P>
<P>When left to him&s;elf, the knight began to mu&s;e on the adventures of that eventful and alarming evening. A thou&s;and ideas crouded upon his ima|gination, and no clue could be found to extricate him&s;elf from the mazes of wonder and a&s;toni&s;h|ment in which he was lo&s;t, the fearful apprehen|&s;ion of who&s;e power he was in, and what would become of him, lay heavy on his heart; impatient to have the my&s;tery of his &s;ituation unfolded, and yet dreaded that period. Hope and fear crouded alternately upon his &s;oul, until at length he fell a&s;leep, overcome by fatigue of body and mind.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="035333_0172_10022FCC772BE2D8">Sir Reginald awoke at ten o'clock in the morn|ing, and after breakfa&s;t, was conducted by a page through three magnificent apartments; in the fourth, the lady of the ca&s;tle, dre&s;&s;ed in black, with a veil of the &s;ame colour, was &s;eated on a &s;ofa. She ro&s;e on his entering the room, and court|&s;ied very civilly, then retook her &s;eat. After a long pau&s;e, the knight &s;aid &s;omething in a faulter|ing accent, which was meant as an excu&s;e for his intruding vi&s;it. The lady kindly bade him wel|come to her ca&s;tle, and moreover de&s;ired him to be &s;eated. This kindne&s;s di&s;pelled all perplexity, and gave him new courage; he related his adven|tures of the preceding evening, at which the lady of the ca&s;tle &s;miled often, and promi&s;ed the knight, that the whole my&s;terious adventure &s;hould be elucidated. After dinner, the &s;ervants were cal|led into the room, and Sir Reginald found every &s;trange event, that had filled him with &s;uch ter|ror, &s;o natural, that he even blu&s;hed at his childi&s;h fears. The ice-cold hand&mdash;the &s;kulls and bones &mdash;the &s;pectre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were found to be the nece&s;&s;ary appendages to every ca&s;tle. The cold hand be|longed to the phlegmatic porter. He drew his hand &s;uddenly back, becau&s;e the knight trembled violently and &s;truggled to di&s;engage him&s;elf, and was obliged to return and light the torch, which the wind had extingui&s;hed. Sir Reginald, with &s;taggering &s;teps, had reached a remote part of the ca&s;tle, where the Counte&s;s had erected a kind of Mau&s;oleum to her decea&s;ed hu&s;band; and his hand had touched the &s;kulls and bones it was dec|orated
<PB N="174" REF="035333_0173_10022FCA250F3A78">
with. The groans and &s;ighs, which he heard, came from an old dome&s;tic, who had a vi|olent tooth-ache. When the &s;tone rolled down, &s;he went out of the cellar, where &s;he was &s;uffered to lie, to &s;ee who was there; &s;he threatened him with her hand, and went back, becau&s;e &s;he mi&s;took him for one of the &s;ervants, and fancied the &s;tone had been thrown down on purpo&s;e to frighten her. The door, which led to the bottomle&s;s room, belong|ed to an old cellar, where the &s;teps had been de&s;troy|ed by the ravages of time, and which the &s;ervants had left open by carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. The room on the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e, where the knight had broken the gla&s;s pane, was inhabited by the cook and butler. Their di&s;cour&s;e, part of which he overheard, con|cerned a hog, which was to be killed the next day. When he was hurrying down the &s;tairca&s;e, the porter received him in his arms, to prevent his falling, and carried him, during his &s;woon, to the apartment, where he recovered the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir Reginald was a&s;hamed that this accidental concurrence of circum&s;tances could have rendered him &s;o ridiculou&s;ly fearful and cowardly.
<Q>This adventure,</Q>
&s;aid the knight to him&s;elf,
<Q>&s;hall teach me to bridle my impetuous imagination, to ex|amine every thing uncommon by the torch of rea|&s;on, and thus to guard my under&s;tanding again&s;t the dangerous delu&s;ions of a lively impetuous fancy.</Q></P>

<L>For ne'er &s;hall the &s;ons of Columbia be &s;aves,</L>
<L>While the earth bears a plant or the &s;ea rolls in waves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our mountains are crown'd with imperial Oak,</L>
<L>Who&s;e roots, like our liberties, ages have nour|i&s;h'd,</L>
<L>But long ere our nation &s;ubmits to the yoke,</L>
<L>Not a tree &s;hall be left on the field where it flouri&s;h'd.</L>
<L>Should inva&s;ion impend,</L>
<L>Every grove would de&s;cend,</L>
<L>From the hill tops they &s;haded, our &s;hores to de|fend.</L>
<L>For ne'er &s;hall the &s;ons of Columbia be &s;laves,</L>
<L>While the earth bears a plant, or the &s;ea rolls in waves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let our Patriots de&s;troy anarch's pe&s;tilent worm,</L>
<L>Le&s;t our liberty's growth &s;hould be check'd by corro&s;ion;</L>
<L>Then let clouds thicken round us, we heed not the &s;torm;</L>
<L>Our realms fear no &s;hock, but the earth's own explo&s;ion.</L>
<L>Foes affail us in vain</L>
<L>Though their fleets bridge the main,</L>
<L><PB N="278" REF="035333_0277_1001FE76EAF6A458">For our altars and laws with our lives we'll main|tain,</L>
<L>And ne'er &s;hall the &s;ons of Columbia be &s;laves,</L>
<L>While the earth bears a plant, or the &s;ea rolls in waves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should the tempe&s;t of war over&s;hadow our land,</L>
<L>Its bolts could ne'er rend freedom's temple a&s;under,</L>
<L>For, unmov'd at its portal, would Wa&s;hington &s;tand,</L>
<L>And repul&s;e, with his brea&s;t, the a&s;&s;aults of the thunder.</L>
<L>His &s;word from the &s;leep</L>
<L>Of its &s;cabbard would leap,</L>
<L>And conduct with its point every fla&s;h to the deep.</L>
<L>For ne'er &s;hall the &s;ons of Columbia be &s;laves,</L>
<L>While the earth bears a plant or the &s;ea rolls in waves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Fame to the world &s;ound America's voice;</L>
<L>No intrigue can her &s;ons from their Govern|ment fever;</L>
<L>Her pride is her Adams&mdash;his laws are her choice,</L>
<L>And &s;hall flouri&s;h till liberty &s;lumber forever.</L>
<L>Then unite, heart and hand</L>
<L>Like Leonidas' band,</L>
<L>And &s;wear to the God of the ocean and land,</L>
<L>That ne'er &s;hall the &s;ons of Columbia be &s;laves,</L>
<L>While the earth bears a plant, or the &s;ea rolls in waves.</L>
