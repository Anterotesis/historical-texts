<P>IN a &s;tate of Exi&s;tence like the pre&s;ent, where there are Beings made for Im|mortality, and put upon Trial a few Years, or rather a few Days, in Order to be train'd up, and fitted for a nobler, hap|pier &s;tate of Things: and where thro' native Sluggi&s;hne&s;s, and Inattention or a contracted Stupor, tho&s;e Beings too &s;eldom think upon their Errand, the great Bu&s;ine&s;s, which im|mediately, and e&s;pecially refers to this better State, 'tis convenient, 'tis frequently needful, that they have a &s;olemn <HI>Memento,</HI> pointing of them forward to the Period of their Trial. The Rea&s;on of it is plain, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> the immediate, &amp; powerful Tendency which it has, to awaken in the Minds of Men, a &s;en&s;e of the Worth of Time, and to beget in them the mo&s;t vigorous Efforts, to do &s;ea&s;onably the Bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;ign'd them in the World. And this Rea&s;on always holds exactly proportionate both to the Em|barra&s;sments

The frequent In&s;tances of Mortality before our Eyes, and the con&s;tant Decays of our own mortal Frame, give us frequent Prae|monitions, of our approaching Di&s;&s;olution.

But that God who had noble Service for him to do in the World, remarkably interpos'd by his Pro|vidence, &amp; pre&s;erv'd his Life, and &s;o provided for his Education, that he &s;hould be well fitted for the public Part, which he was to act in the World. And immediately upon the dawning of the Day of I&s;rael's Deliverance, God him|&s;elf called him to Action. Mo&s;es had by this Time bani&s;h'd him&s;elf from Pharaoh's Court, and di&s;own'd his adoptive Son&s;hip to Pha|raoh's Daughter, and was become Son in Law to the Prie&s;t of Midian, by taking his Daugh|ter to Wife; by which means he becomes the Keeper of Jethro's, his Fathers Flock.</P>
<P>And whil'&s;t Mo&s;es was leading his Flock to the back&s;ide of the De&s;art, he came to Mount Horeb, the Mountain of God, where the Angel of the Lord, or rather the Lord Him&s;elf appear'd to him in a Flame of Fire, and commun'd with him, fir&s;t reminding him of the affliction of his People I&s;rael; and then expre&s;&s;ing his De&s;ign of delivering them from their Egyptian Thraldom: And Commi&s;&s;ions Mo&s;es to go upon the public, and important&punc; Bu&s;ine&s;s, and gives him &s;uch Credentials, that who&s;oever di&s;puted his Commi&s;&s;ion might

<P N="1">(1) I &s;hall <HI>con&s;ider Mo&s;es approving him&s;elf the Servant of the Lord, in leading forth the Host of I&s;rael.</HI> God might without improv|ing Mo&s;es have led forth the Armies of I&s;rael, which in a way of Eminence were the Ho&s;t of the Lord. Indeed their Deliverance out of Egypt was &s;o much the Lord's immediate Work, that He is &s;aid to have brought them out of Egypt, with an high Hand, and an out|&s;tretched Arm, and with great Terriblene&s;s, and with Signs, and with Wonders.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 26. 8.</NOTE> But He might, without u&s;ing his Servant Mo&s;es, tho|roughly have &s;ubdued that haughty Monarch,

Pharaoh King of Egypt. He might ea&s;ily have broken his hard Heart, or Rais'd &s;o much Compa&s;&s;ion in it, as to have eas'd the galling Yoke, and releas'd I&s;rael from his Bondage. He might by his immediate Agency, or under the Conduct of Angels, have led his Cho&s;en &s;afe through the Deep, and through the De&s;ert. And even when their March was interrupted by Nations mightier than them&s;elves, he might by the Breath of his No&s;trils have devour'd them immediately, or mar&s;hal'd his Stars to have fought from Heaven in their Cour&s;es a|gain&s;t them, &amp; &s;o have left Mo&s;es in the mean Time, in his former Ob&s;curity to have fed his Fathers Flock. But GOD makes u&s;e of Men, for the Accompli&s;hment of his De&s;igns among Men. And as Mo&s;es was the Servant of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o this was one Way, in which he was to &s;erve Him. I&s;rael mu&s;t be led by the Hand of Mo&s;es.

Mo&s;es do's not threaten him that he would rai&s;e an Army, and force a Pa&s;&s;age for I&s;rael; but he urges the Honour, and Au|thority

of his King, and gives Pharaoh to un|der&s;tand, that it was at his Peril to refu&s;e. And &s;uch were the &s;peaking awful Arguments which he u&s;ed, as pretty thoroughly convinc'd Pharaoh, that it was in vain for him to mea|&s;ure Arms with the Almighty. So the Lord led them forth <HI>by the right Hand of Mo&s;es, with his glorious Arm, dividing the Water be|fore them; to make him&s;elf an everla&s;ting Name.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 63, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>And truly the Lord of Ho&s;ts was a great King, and his Name was dreadful among the Heathen. It is mention'd as an In&s;tance of <HI>Roman</HI> Greatne&s;s, while Rome was in the very Zenith of her Glory, That &s;he &s;aved Egypt when under her Protection, and cau&s;ed An|tiochus who with a va&s;t Army had laid Siege to Egypt&punc; to di&s;band, only at the bid|ding of two or three Senators, who had no other Armour or Retinue, than a Staff, and a waiting Man. Tis a memorable In&s;tance of the Power, and Greatne&s;s of the Roman com|mon Wealth. But what is this compar'd with the Power of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, and what was this Terrour compar'd with that which Seis'd the Egyptian King; when he <HI>who&s;e Excellency is over I&s;rael, &amp; who&s;e Strength is in the Clouds,</HI> dealt with him, by the Hand only of his Ser|vants Mo&s;es, and Aaron. Never was a proud

hardned Man more Mortify'd: for after &s;e|veral fruitle&s;s Shifts, he relea&s;ed near two Mil|lions; not meerly of his Subjects, but even of his Va&s;&s;als, and all at the in&s;tance and bidding of Mo&s;es, and Aaron only, who Demanded in the Name of their God&punc; and King. The Lord made to him&s;elf an everla&s;ting Name, <HI>by the marvellous Things he did in the Land of Egypt, in the Field of Zoan&mdash;When he brought up I&s;rael out of the Sea, with the Shepherd of his Flock.</HI> Mo&s;es was the Shepherd, the Leader of his Flock, the Captain of his Ho&s;t. He had the Ho&s;t of I&s;rael at his Command: but was him&s;elf <HI>the Servant of the Lord in commanding of them.</HI> He was the leader of I&s;rael, but was led him&s;elf by I&s;rael's God.

And tho' he led I&s;|rael &s;everal times to Battle, yet he led them no where, except where the Cloud which was a Symbol of the divine Pre&s;ence led him. He had in Battle the A&s;&s;urance of the Divine Pre|&s;ence, and with it, the A&s;&s;urance of Succe&s;s. Thus faith the Lord to his Servant <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> with re&s;pect to Og the King of Ba&s;han, who went out with all his People again&s;t I&s;rael, to the Battle at Edrei. <HI>Fear him not, for I have de|liver'd him into thy Hand, and all his People, and this Land,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> 21, 34.</NOTE> Mo&s;es the Servant of the

Lord &s;erv'd him faithfully, in leading forth his Armies, both from Egypt, and through the Wilderne&s;s: &s;ometimes as the Mini&s;ter of God's Vengeance; but oftner as a nur&s;ing Fa|ther, and good Captain, leading and feeding I&s;rael. So that there was never a man whom I&s;rael had more Rea&s;on to love; or their E|nemies more Rea&s;on to fear.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Mo&s;es approv'd him&s;elf the Servant of the Lord by giving Law to I&s;rael.</HI> The Jewi&s;h Polity, Civil as well as Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, was pure|ly Theocratical. God was King in Je&s;hurun, &amp; gave Law to I&s;rael. So that Mo&s;es was no other way a Lawgiver, than only a Promulger of the Law. He did not make the Law, but declar'd what was Law; and in this Character he &s;erv'd God eminently. God might in this Ca&s;e, as well as in the foregoing, have made u&s;e of the Mini&s;try of Angels, or have &s;poken immediately from the Excellent Glory, with an audible voice to the People; but the People were afraid of &s;eeing or hearing immediately from God, le&s;t the Glory of his Vi&s;ion, or the Terrour of his Voice, &s;hould be too mighty for them. Hence &s;aid they unto Mo&s;es, <HI>&s;peak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God &s;peak with us, le&s;t we die.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> 20, 19.</NOTE> But this Service God re&s;erv'd for Mo&s;es to do. And accordingly de&s;cends him|&s;elf upon the Top of Sinai, &amp; call'd for Mo&s;es
<PB N="10" REF="006989_0013_102AB24A21D69900">
to appear in the Place of Thunder, even upon the Top of the &s;moaking Mountain, to receive the Law at his Mouth. There he gave him that excellent Compendium of Morality, con|tain'd in the Decalogue, or a Summary of the moral Duties, which men owe to their Maker, and to one another; ca&s;t into ten di&s;tinct Pre|cepts. God at &s;undry Times &s;pake to his Ser|vant Mo&s;es, &amp; by him gave Laws, which were be&s;t adapted to the Circum&s;tances of the Peo|ple. Some of them merely of a ritual tem|poray Nature, which if we ben't able to &s;ee the immediate Rea&s;on of, yet may re&s;t &s;atisfied, &amp; content in this, that they were &s;uch as he, who knew infinitely well their Circum&s;tances, the Temper of their Minds, their Lu&s;ts, their pronene&s;s to Idolatry, and their need of a con|&s;tant heavy Yoke; in his Wi&s;dom &s;aw meet to enjoin upon them. Some of them were mere|ly typical, referring to the Coming, and King|dom of the Me&s;&s;iah; which of Cour&s;e were to cea&s;e, when the great Antitype Appear'd: the&s;e like the Twilight of the Morning, were done away by the opening of the perfect Day. Others of them again, were la&s;ting in <HI>their Na|ture, and of perpetual Obligation;</HI> &s;uch were the Laws refering to commutative Ju&s;tice, and &s;uch were many of the Laws referring to capi|tal Crimes. Many of the&s;e have been tran&s;|crib'd into, and now adorn the Engli&s;h Laws,
<PB N="11" REF="006989_0014_102AB27EEDB14018">
and won't cea&s;e to be excellent, and u&s;eful in their Nature &s;o long as Time la&s;ts. The&s;e were the Laws, which Mo&s;es the Servant of the Lord received from God him&s;elf, and pub|li&s;h'd to I&s;rael: and which he adapted, and made in a &s;en&s;e his own Laws. And in &s;o doing he did eminent Service, for his King. For in &s;uch a world as this we live in, where Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion, Corruption, and Lu&s;t, have univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed them&s;elves among Man|kind, there would be no tolerable Living, unle&s;s Men were laid under the direction &amp; re&s;traint of Law. And that Legi&s;lator, that enacts or (being made) adapts, good, wi&s;e, and whole|&s;ome Laws; contributes in a good Proportion to the Health, &amp; Pro&s;perity of the Common|wealth, and de&s;erves well of it. This did Mo&s;es: he &s;erv'd his Generation faithfully this Way according to the Will of God. By this Service to his Generation, he &s;erv'd his Ma|ker, who is abundantly honour'd and pleas'd with a good moral Government of the World. None of the Princes of I&s;rael, ever di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves like Mo&s;es in giving Laws to the People.&mdash;Tho' he was the Servant of the Lord, he was a dignify'd one; he was admit|ted to &s;peak Face to Face, with his Maker, to receive the Law from his Mouth, and he de|liver'd it, with &s;ome Beams of divine Glory on his Countenance. And truly, <HI>there aro&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="006989_0015_102AB24CC892E2A0">
not a Prophet &s;ince in I&s;rael like unto Mo&s;es, whom the Lord knew Face to Face,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 34. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>Mo&s;es approv'd him&s;elf eminently the Servant of the Lord, by taking Care that the Laws were well executed.</HI> Laws however good in them&s;elves, can do no Good, with|out a &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of them, and the Execution of condign Puni&s;hment upon the Breakers of them. Mo&s;es &s;en&s;ible of this, di&s;cover'd a tender Regard for the Law, and a &s;uitable Concern for the due Execution of it. Indeed &s;uch was the Burthen of public Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, lying upon this great Man, that he was not able to give his Attendance in executive Courts, except it was in &s;ome high, &amp; important Ca&s;es. But he was neverthele&s;s concern'd that Ju&s;tice &s;hould be done, and the Honour of the Law maintain'd. Agreeably we find this noble Law-giver and Judge, upon the Revi&s;al of his Law declaring to I&s;rael, in a general A&s;|&s;embly of their Tribes, as in Deut. 1. 13, &amp; <HI>on, Take ye wi&s;e Men, and under&s;tanding,</HI> &amp; <HI>known among your Tribes, and I will make them Ru|lers over you.&mdash;So I took the Chief of your Tribes, Wi&s;e Men and known, and made them Heads over you, Captains over Thou&s;ands,&mdash;and Officers among your Tribes. And I charg'd your Judges at that Time, &s;aying, hear the Cau&s;e between your Brethren, and judge righteou&s;ly

between every Man and his Brother and the Stranger that is with him.

He doth execute the Judg|ment of the Fatherle&s;s, and Widow, and loveth the Stranger.</HI> Here's a Conduct, and here are Coun&s;els and Commands, worthy of an in|&s;pired Lawgiver and Judge: how equal, how di&s;intere&s;ted; how free from party Spirit, and &s;ervile Compliance, and how every Way be|coming God's Deputy, and Viceroy here on Earth.</P>

a Friend to good Men, and very e&s;pecially to <HI>Aaron,</HI> who &s;tood not meerly in the Relation of a Child to God, but in the Relation of a Prie&s;t of the mo&s;t High, and was to tran&s;act between God, and the People, in Things of the mo&s;t &s;olemn Nature, and of infinite Impor|tance. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;en&s;ible how much the good of I&s;rael, their &s;piritual, and everla&s;ting good de|pended upon <HI>Aaron's</HI> Influence, endeavour'd in all proper Ways to a&s;&s;i&s;t, &amp; &s;trengthen him.

Yea, God him&s;elf taught <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> thus to do, by putting peculiar Marks of Honour &amp; Re&s;pect upon <HI>Aaron;</HI> not as a Man, or as a good Man, but as one who &s;u&s;tain'd a high Office, as one from whom, God expected much Serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e, and as one who needed a good Degree of Influence, in order to maintain the Honour of his Lord, &s;upport his &s;acerdotal Character, and be exten|&s;ively U&s;eful to I&s;rael.

bearing up under heavy Burthens, with Even|ne&s;s, and Meekne&s;s of Temper, and leading I&s;rael with Skilfulne&s;s of Hand. We may read in him the divine Lawgiver, &amp; the di&s;intere&s;ted Judge; a hearty Friend to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Wor&s;hip of God, a nur&s;ing Father to the Church, and an Encouragement, &amp; Support to a faithful Mini&s;try. As the&s;e are things which meet in a great Ruler, &s;o in the&s;e &s;everal Ca|pacities of Life, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> conducted with that Integrity &amp; Uprightne&s;s, as to &s;hew him&s;elf heartily attach'd, to his God, and to his Peo|ple; and that his Mind was very much attem|per'd to the Divine Mind. And in the whole he has left an Example, very well worthy the Imitation of all tho&s;e, who act in the &s;ame public Capacities that he did.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was the Servant of the Lord, and a very obedient one too, thr&ocirc; the Cour&s;e of his Life, &s;o he was obedient even in Death. <HI>For according to the Word of the Lord;</HI> or at God's bidding, <HI>he went up from the Plains of Moab, unto Mount Nebo, and died there in the Land of Moab.</HI>&mdash;And is he dead?

the Scourge, and Terrour of their Enemies, the Friend of GOD, and a powerful Interce&s;&s;or with Heaven. But the Scene now &s;hifts, the Curtains draw, Gloomine&s;s, and the Shadow of Death cover him. One would as &s;oon have pitch'd upon Mo&s;es as any Man, to have out|brav'd the Jaws of Death, and gone tri|umphing Body &amp; Soul up to Heaven. But he drags the Load of Fle&s;h no higher, than to the Top of Nebo, where his Soul drops its Burthen, and wings her Way to the upper Re|gions. If Piety, and the Love of GOD, could have exempted him from Death, if true For|titude, &amp; Greatne&s;s could have driven back the King of Terrours, if the greate&s;t U&s;eful|ne&s;s to his People, join'd with their Prayers, and Tears, could have repriev'd him from the Grave, he had not died.

But he mu&s;t encounter his la&s;t E|nemy, and there could be no Di&s;charge in that War: I&s;rael mu&s;t fight their own Enemies, and leave their Leader, and their Prince, to be vanqui&s;h'd by his, without being able to re&s;cue or a&s;&s;i&s;t him.

Mo&s;es like other Men was but Du&s;t in his Original, and mu&s;t return to it by Putrefaction. As there was a Time for him to be born, &s;o he mu&s;t find Time to die; yea, th&ocirc; he was a God he mu&s;t die like a Man, and fall like one of the Princes: Th&ograve; he was a God, <HI>i. e.</HI> bore &s;ome Re&s;emblance of Him, in Honour, Power, Influence, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> yet he was not like GOD Immortal; but like other Men a dying Creature: Th&ocirc; at the age of one hun|dred and twenty his Eye was not dim, nor his natural Force abated, yet he had the Princi|ples of Mortality within him, and, like other Men, was liable to Wearine&s;s, Pain, &amp; Di&s;ea&s;e,

of the Commonwealth, to protect it again&s;t their Enemies.</HI> Ever &s;ince Mankind have apo&s;ta|tiz'd from GOD, and corrupted their Way upon Earth&punc; this Earth which would otherwi&s;e have been, the Habitation of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o the dwelling Place of Peace, has been &s;o fill'd with Broils &amp; Di&s;cord, with Faction, and War, and Blood; as to render it not unlike a Den of Dragons. In this corrupt State of Things, alth&ocirc; Mankind have been favour'd with &s;uch natural Notices of Truth, &amp; Ju&s;tice, and Equity, as to be able to di&s;cern between Right, and Wrong. And the &s;everal Divi|&s;ions of Mankind, into di&s;tinct Kingdoms, &amp; Commonwealths, have for them&s;elves enacted Laws, for the &s;ettling, and &s;ecuring Property, and maintaining their natural Rights: Yet the&s;e have been too weak, to prevent civil Di&s;cord, in the &s;ame Community, and much too weak, to prevent different Kingdoms from unju&s;t Inva&s;ions of one anothers Pro|perties, &amp; Rights. And when either of the&s;e happens, either civil Di&s;cord in the &s;ame Community, or an Inva&s;ion from a forein Power; it highly becomes the Magi&s;trate, I mean tho&s;e that are at the Head of Govern|ment, vigorou&s;ly to exert them&s;elves, for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of one, and the Repul&s;ion of the other. Their Lives, their Liberties, their Properties, their Families, their Country de|mands

it of them, that they appear, when Ne|ce&s;&s;ity calls for it; either Per&s;onally, or by brave, and well cho&s;en Generals, in the high Places of the Field, to &s;ubdue the Rebel, and drive back the invading Foe. Yea, the Ca&s;e may be &s;uch, as to make it their Duty to carry War, into neighbouring Kingdoms, for the Defence of their Countries Property, &amp; Right: As where Neighbouring Kingdoms, or States commit Robbery, and incroach upon them, and refu&s;e Recompence. Such inte&s;tine mu|tunous Jars, &s;uch Inva&s;ions, &amp; Incroachments, threaten the very Being of the Government where they are, and unle&s;s prevented, mu&s;t I&s;&s;ue in the Di&s;&s;olution of it. The Being of the Commonwealth requires; that &s;uch Power be lodg'd in the Civil Magi&s;trates Hand, and the well-being of it requires, that on &s;uch &s;pecial Occa&s;ions this Power be exerci&s;ed. It behoves tho&s;e then who &s;et at Helm, to face the Danger, and call forth tho&s;e, that are at their Command, to make a Stand again&s;t it, and &s;ave their Country.</P>
<P>And in doing this, they fulfil one good Part of their Character, even that of Shields of the Earth: Which is a Title given to Rulers by the Royal P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 47. 9. <HI>The Princes of the People are gathered together, even the People of the God of Abraham; for the Shields of the Earth belong unto God.</HI>&mdash;The Shield

was a Piece of Armour, formerly u&s;ed for a Defence in Battle, and as here u&s;ed, 'tis a happy Figure repre&s;enting the Protection, Defence, and Safeguard, which good Rulers are to their Land, again&s;t the Power, &amp; Craft of their Enemies. When civil Di&s;cord, and Rebellion, broke out in I&s;rael, in the In&s;tance of <HI>Korah,</HI> &amp; his Company, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> immediately interpo&s;es for the Subduing of it.</P>
<P>And &s;o when his People were call'd to en|counter mighty Nations, he very readily fac'd the Danger, &amp; eminently fulfil'd the Character, of the Shield of I&s;rael: &s;o did the other good Rulers of I&s;rael that &s;ucceeded him. What an Ornament, and Glory, as well as Safeguard to a Land, is the good Ruler, who in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e Storms, foreign and dome&s;tick which beat upon a State, &s;tands like a Rock in the Sea, it breaks the Waves, but remains firm and un&s;haken it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But alas the want of &s;uch Shields! After the Death of Mo&s;es, and Jo&s;hua, when there was no King in I&s;rael, and every man did what was right in his own Eyes, tho' it was wrong in the Eyes of every Body el&s;e: Behold what Confu&s;ion! Civil War pre&s;ently aro&s;e between the Tribes, and more than twenty thou&s;and of them fell in one Day. And this, or &s;ome|thing like this, is too ea&s;ily and too often the Ca&s;e when a Community have not men at

Helm, that have both Skill, and Ability, to check &s;uch Di&s;cord at the fir&s;t Beginning of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It becomes the civil Ruler to make, or a|dapt good Laws,</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;ee them well executed.</HI> In a &s;tate of Innocence and Perfection, where Light and Love direct the Way, and govern every Action; there would doubtle&s;s be no need of any other Laws, than tho&s;e which are eternal, &amp; nece&s;&s;ary in their own Nature, which are written upon the Mind of every intelligent Creature, in Characters &s;o deep, as never to be effac'd. But in a &s;tate of Things like this, in a world where every Thing is out of Order, &amp; nothing more &s;o, than the minds of men, e&s;pe|cially their wills &amp; affections, the leading Fa|culties of the Soul there is the utmo&s;t need of good Laws guarded by well cho&s;en Sanctions. The Safety, Peace, &amp; Pro&s;perity of tho&s;e Nati|ons, that have been under the happy Directi|on, and Re&s;traint of &s;uch Laws, &s;peaks this Truth aloud; but the Rapine, Wars, &amp; Blood, of &s;ome barbarous, Ignorant, and lawle&s;s Na|tions, &s;peak it louder. The highland Clans, and the Crooms of Guinea, are &s;ad In&s;tances of this. The latter e&s;pecially proves that the want of good Laws well executed or in other words, the want of a well concerted Govern|ment, makes one of the riche&s;t Parts of the Globe, a Field of Robbery &amp; Blood; where,
<PB N="26" REF="006989_0029_102AB261A0508D70">
neither Property, Liberty, nor Life, is in any tolerable Mea&s;ure &s;ecure. But civil Rulers, which are Mini&s;ters of GOD, for good to the People, are to attend upon this very Thing, among others, and take Care that they have a good Sy&s;tem of Laws, grounded upon the Fit|ne&s;s of Things, the everla&s;ting Rules of Truth and Ju&s;tice; and well adapted to the Circum|&s;tances, and State of their People. <Q>Upon this depends the very Foundations of all civil Government, and of all mutual Society a|mong men; for by them the Magi&s;trate is directed how to govern, &amp; the People how far to obey; the Magi&s;trate by them is &s;et|led in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Authority over the People, and the People too by them are &s;ecured from the arbitrary Power, and un|rea&s;onable Demands of the Magi&s;trate, as well as from the Fraud, Violence, &amp; Op|pre&s;&s;ion of each other.</Q><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Potters's</HI> Antiquity, <HI>Vol.</HI> 1. <HI>P.</HI> 130.</NOTE> And hence 'tis doubtle&s;s the Duty of the Magi&s;trate to con&s;ult the Laws of Nature, and of Nations, to &s;tudy Men, &amp; Things, &amp; get well acquainted with the Genius, and Intere&s;t of that People, to whom they are to give Law. The Divine Law will furni&s;h the Magi&s;trate with a good Model, and the general Direction of Scripture will a|bundantly help him, in drawing the Plan for a noble Body of Laws. But as the State of the
<PB N="27" REF="006989_0030_102AB2929F787138">
<HI>Jews</HI> differ'd from that of every other Na|tion, &s;o their Laws taken collectively won't &s;uit the Con&s;titution of any Nation under Heaven. And indeed &s;uch are the different Circum&s;tances, and Con&s;titutions of different Kingdoms, and Governments, that no one Bo|dy of Laws would &s;uit any two di&s;tinct Go|vernments. And yet perhaps there is no en|lightned well inform'd common wealth, but what has &s;ome Laws peculiar to it &s;elf, that might well be adapted by another Govern|ment. 'Tis therefore doubtle&s;s a Duty, which the civil Magi&s;trate owes to his People, to look over the Archives of the be&s;t model'd, &amp; mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Kingdoms. And having collected a good Body of Laws, it remains a Duty for the Magi&s;trate to &s;ee that they are well exe|cuted. It will be to very little Purpo&s;e to have good Laws, without a good Execution of them. Tho&s;e that need Laws mo&s;t, will be lea&s;t influenc'd by them, if there is nothing more in them than the Rea&s;on of Things, and the Magi&s;trates word. The Law is made for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient; but 'tis the Sancti|on, or Penalty of the Law, rather than the Fit|ne&s;s, and Rea&s;on of it, that re&s;trains, and go|verns them. Hence it becomes the chief Ru|lers of the Common wealth, to take &s;pecial Care, that the executive Courts are provided with men of &s;trict Ju&s;tice, good Improvement,
<PB N="28" REF="006989_0031_102AB2632C0FF3F8">
and Penetration. The civil Government of <HI>Athens</HI> was ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd one of the be&s;t in the World. Among Heathen Governments there was none in the Age, wherein <HI>Athens</HI> flouri&s;h'd, that could claim Pree&s;idence, if E|quality with it. And never did their Glory ri&s;e higher than under the admini&s;tration of <HI>Solon,</HI> that great, and wi&s;e Lawgiver, and two or three more, who after &s;ome Interruption in the Government, &s;ucceeded him, re&s;tor'd his Laws, and improv'd upon them. But <HI>Solon</HI> was as careful to have his Laws well executed, as he was to give good Laws, and endeavour'd that his People &s;hould be govern'd by them after his Death at lea&s;t an hundred Years; and bound every one of the Senate by a &s;olemn Oath, and the Forfeiture of a Golden Statue, as big as him&s;elf, not to Violate one Statute.</P>
<P>There can certainly be no Safety in a Com|munity where there are not both good Laws, and a faithful Execution of them. Nor with|out the&s;e can the civil Magi&s;trate by any means fulfil the Character of a faithful Servant of the Lord, or Father of his Country.&mdash;Indeed while he acts the Part of a true Patriot, in cal|culating, and executing Laws for the Suppre&s;&s;i|on of Vice, and the Promotion of his Coun|try; 'tis next to certain, that Men of perver&s;e Minds, that hate to be reclaim'd, Men of party Spirits that are ever impatient under

Turn, not only without, but even in Oppo&s;i|tion to the civil Magi&s;trate.

<P>But this was at a Time when the civil Ma|gi&s;trate was <HI>Heathen,</HI> and when the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oeconomy, and Church State were to be &s;et a&s;ide, and di&s;&s;olv'd; and a new, and di&s;tinct Oeconomy and Di&s;pen&s;ation to take Place in the World. A Change this, &s;o great, and &s;o over-bearing, to <HI>Jewi&s;h-Bigotry,</HI> and <HI>Gentile Idolatry,</HI> that nothing le&s;s than Miracles could prove &s;uch Change to be the Will of God. And doubtle&s;s the rapid Progre&s;s of the Go&s;|pel, and it's &s;urprizing Spread, when Earth, &amp; Hell were combin'd for its Suppre&s;&s;ion, was de&s;ign'd as a miraculous Proof, that <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> was now ended, and <HI>Chri&s;tanity</HI> to take the Place of it. And this being the De&s;ign of its great Author, no Wonder it flouri&s;h'd in De|fiance of all the Powers that were ingag'd a|gain&s;t it. 'Tis perhaps from this that &s;ome very weak People &s;eem to think that the Go&s;|pel would flouri&s;h mo&s;t, when it was mo&s;t oppos'd, and accordingly have invited Per&s;e|cution, and had rather break over the Rules of Decency, &amp; Chri&s;tianity than not be oppo&s;ed.
<PB N="32" REF="006989_0035_102AB269B65E7CD0">
But notwith&s;tanding Chri&s;tianity has flouri&s;h'd without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the civil Power, and even in oppo&s;ition to it, whil&s;t the Magi&s;trate was <HI>Heathen,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> needed Miracles for its Support, and Proof; can we thence conclude, that <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> would be likely to flouri&s;h more eminently in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Magi&s;trate, in a Country where it is generally profe&s;s'd; or that the Magi&s;trates Countenance, Example, and Influence, would not &s;erve the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity. Certain|ly we are to admit no &s;uch Thing.</P>
<P>That God that hath in&s;tituted the Chri&s;tian Religion, hath al&s;o appointed civil Govern|ment: So that 'tis to make the In&s;titutions of Heaven cla&s;h with one another, to &s;uppo&s;e that the Chri&s;tian Religion would flouri&s;h mo&s;t, when the civil Magi&s;trate mo&s;t oppos'd it. In a common &s;tate of Things, where Chri&s;tiani|ty generally obtains, and the Proofs of it's Di|vinity are admitted; the foregoing Suppo&s;iti|on carries in it nothing le&s;s ab&s;urd, than this, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> that the Appointments of Heaven are &s;o jarring &amp; incon&s;i&s;tent, that the Being and Life of one depends upon the De&s;truction of ano|ther.

mourn'd, &amp; fled into the Wilderne&s;s, &amp; &s;eem'd as tho' &s;he wound be intirely extinct.</P>
<P>Tis evident that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> thought they never walk'd &s;tronger than when they walk'd Hand in Hand, and that the civil and religious Intere&s;ts of the People, on one Hand, and civil and religious Di&s;cord on the other, would ri&s;e &amp; fall together. Hence they endea|vour'd not to oppo&s;e, but to Strengthen each other; <HI>Aaron</HI> for a Mouth to <HI>Mo&s;es&punc;</HI> &amp; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in&s;tead of GOD, <HI>i. e.</HI> for a Head &amp; Ruler un|to <HI>Aaron.</HI> Undoubtedly the civil Magi&s;trate may like a nur&s;ing Father, protect, encourage, and &s;trengthen the Church of God, and the Wor&s;hip of God; by Influence, by a good Example, and even by well concerted Laws re&s;pecting the Temporalities of the Church. And this Way he is to approve him&s;elf the Friend of GOD, a nur&s;ing Father to the Church, and an Encourager of Divine Wor&s;hip. In Things of a temporal civil Nature, the civil Magi&s;trate has undoubted Right to interpo&s;e his Authority for the Church: but not to ex|erci&s;e Dominion over the Con&s;ciences of Men, by impo&s;ing Articles of Faith, and enforcing Sub&s;criptions with Penalties; for <HI>though the Pur&s;e is Cae&s;ars, the Con&s;cience is God's:</HI> And Authority of this Kind exercis'd by Men, is a bold U&s;urpation of CHRIST's Kingly Go|vernment; and th&ocirc; it might be moderate, and
<PB N="34" REF="006989_0037_102AB29D93A724A8">
mode&s;t at fir&s;t, it would probably enough end, in all the Fooleries, and Butcheries of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Such Authority may make Fools, it may make Knaves, but it will never make Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Indeed the Plea of Con&s;cience I am &s;ensible is a Subterfuge, where &s;ometimes hone&s;t weak Men, and oftner wicked de&s;igning ones take Sanctuary to defend them&s;elves from Law &amp; Ju&s;tice, and to do infinite Mi&s;chief in the World: But 'tis Con&s;cience, &amp; not mere Pre|ten&s;ions to it, that is &s;o &s;acred &amp; inviolable.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the civil Magi&s;trate leaves this to a higher Tribunal; there are many things tend|ing to the Health, Peace, and flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Zion which God requires, and his Church expects from the Magi&s;trate, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that he ap|pears bold and very Couragious for the Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of Vice of every Denomination, and the Encouragement of Vertue. Agreeably St. Paul in his De&s;cription of the civil Ruler &s;ays, <HI>Rulers are not a Terrour to good Works, but to the evil.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 3.</NOTE> Yea God and his People ex|pect of civil Magi&s;trates that they contribute their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;upport and well being of the Church, by the encouragement of Learn|ing, &s;upporting Schools the le&s;s with the great|er, but e&s;pecially the Schools of the Prophets, &amp; endowing them with tho&s;e Privileges which
<PB N="35" REF="006989_0038_102B2090B8CFFDB8">
are very needful to form men for Temple Ser|vice, that Zion may have of her <HI>Sons for Pro|phets, and of her young men for Nazarites.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Amos</HI> 2. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover the civil Magi&s;trate fulfilling the Character of a nur&s;ing Father to the Church, is to add to the&s;e, the Force, and Influence of his own Example, going before the People in the Paths of Vertue, and Shining in all the Graces of the Chri&s;tian Life.</P>
<P>And indeed the&s;e are things nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of the Government. Without Vice &s;uppre&s;t, Vertue encouraged, and Learning promoted, a civil Government can't &s;ub&s;i&s;t long, the Foundations will &s;ap, and the whole Frame of Government mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It becomes civil Rulers to remember, that they are Servants of the Lord; but Servants dignify'd above the re&s;t of their fellow-Servants.</HI> Mo&s;es that Divine Man, alth&ocirc; he was the Head of I&s;rael, their Ruler and their Judge; yet was him&s;elf rul'd of GOD, and was but his Ser|vant. Indeed all are but Servants unto GOD; he makes even his Angels mini&s;tring Spi|rits: and from the Seraph down to the low|e&s;t In&s;ect 'tis true of all, that they are Servants unto him.</P>
<P>The civil Magi&s;trate is &s;o. Th&ocirc; they may be high honour'd, and rever'd as God's, yet they are Servants of the Lord, and as depen|dent
<PB N="36" REF="006989_0039_102AB2D3F0A2B6D0">
upon their Maker and Ma&s;ter, as the mo&s;t abject Slave.</P>
<P>Th&ocirc; they may have thou&s;ands at their Com|mand and &s;ay unto one go, and he goes, and to another come and he comes, yet they are them&s;elves Servants of the Lord, &amp; mu&s;t come &amp; go at his bidding, they mu&s;t &s;erve the Lord, with Fear, &amp; be intirely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his Will. Th&ocirc; they may have the Power of Life and Death, &s;o that whom they will they kill, and whom they will they &s;ave alive, yet after all they are but Servants unto God, and there's not a Soul of them that can ran&s;om his own Life from the Grave.</P>
<P>As this is the ca&s;e with civil Magi&s;trates even the mo&s;t independant of them; &s;o it be|comes them to remember it, &amp; improve it as an Argument to Fidelity; for 'tis required of Stewards, of Servants, that they be faithful. They have a high Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and many Talents committed to them, to occupy in their Ma&s;ters Ab&s;ence; their Work is great, their Privileges great, and their Reward, if faithful will al&s;o be great when their LORD &s;hall return having received a Kingdom.&mdash;<HI>Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye Kings: be in&s;truct|ed ye Judges of the Earth.

But whil&s;t the civil Magi&s;trate remembers that he is a Servant, he mu&s;t con&s;ider of what Cla&s;s he is, that he is dignify'd above the re&s;t of his Fellow-Servants, he mu&s;t &s;teadily bear it in mind, le&s;t he &s;hould act beneath his Charac|ter, and forfeit the Honour which his Ma&s;ter has put upon him.</P>
<P>Th&ocirc; Mankind are all of one Blood, yet all don't &s;tand upon a level; there are Superiors and Inferiors, as well as Equals among them. Civil Rulers are of the highe&s;t Order among&s;t Men; they are cloathed with the Robes of royalty and maje&s;ty, and in their Office bear &s;ome re&s;emblance of the great Governour of the World; like him they are to con&s;ult the good of Men, like him to protect their People from Injuries, to puni&s;h Vice and reward Ver|tue, and &s;hed their Kindly influence upon Man|kind. The Lord Almighty has given them the Title of Gods, has put on them &s;ome of his Honour, and made them &s;hine with &s;ome faint Beams of his Glory, giving us in them a &s;mall Specimen of his Greatne&s;s, Authority and di&s;|tributive Ju&s;tice. A powerful Argument mu&s;t this be with the good Ruler to act up to the dignity of his Office, and never to &s;ully tho&s;e divine Features which he bears: This &s;hould be a powerful inducement to him, to re&s;emble Him, who&s;e Title and Honour he &s;u&s;tains, to be univer&s;ally benevolent to mankind, and be|nificent

to tho&s;e with whom he is concern'd, to guard their Privileges, vindicate their Rights, di&s;tribute Ju&s;tice with an equal Hand, &s;hew Mercy to all Men, and thus keep up the ho|nourable Di&s;tinction which God has put upon him in the World.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration that we are Men and rea|&s;onable Creatures, and capable of an honourable and happy Alliance with the upper World, might well keep Men from Symbolizing with the Bea&s;t from groveling in the Du&s;t, &amp; mix|ing with Sen&s;uality &amp; Lu&s;t. E&s;pecially then the Con&s;ideration of a &s;tate of Eminence, and Superiority in Life, ought powerfully to guard the Magi&s;trate again&s;t what&s;oever is low and mean, &s;ervile and &s;en&s;ual, again&s;t what&s;o|ever mi&s;becomes a Man, that is the off-&s;pring of GOD.&mdash;The Remembrance, and Con&s;ide|ration of a &s;tate of Dignity, and Eminence in the World, may, and it ought to &s;erve the&s;e noble Purpo&s;es. But 'tis &s;adly otherwi&s;e, when Men take Occa&s;ion from their advanc'd Station, to nur&s;e fal&s;e Conceptions of them|&s;elves, to feed their Vanity, and think them|&s;elves more than mortal Gods; when they grow giddy, and look down from their Eleva|tion with Contempt upon the re&s;t of Mankind, as Creatures made only for their Service, and to bear Burthens. This Temper generally i&s;&s;ues in a Neglect of public Intere&s;t, in Op|pre&s;&s;ion,

<P>Had the Character been drawn to the Life it would have been a perfect Mirrour of good Government.

<P>But &s;o different are the private Intere&s;t of Men, &s;o various and head&s;trong their Pa&s;&s;ions and Lu&s;ts, that good Laws and a &s;trict Exe|cution of them, will probably bring upon you the Odium of many.

'Tis the Evidence of a Mind truly great, and a nece&s;&s;ary Ingredient in the Character of a wi&s;e Ruler, to be able to di&s;|cern at a Di&s;tance his Country's Intere&s;t and Safety, and beholding it, to follow his own Light, with a &s;teady Pace, thro' all the Con|&s;equences which it points out to him, amid&s;t unde&s;erv'd Reproaches, and hard Treatment.

<P>But for Zions &s;ake I will not hold my Peace.

So that were it only upon political Views, you mu&s;t be greatly wanting to the People under your Government, if you &s;hould not to the utmo&s;t, endeavour the Promotion of real Religion.</P>

But this is not all, 'tis but the lea&s;t Part, our all is embark'd, not only the comfort of this tran&s;itory World, but our everla&s;ting well-being depends upon in|ward Holine&s;s, the Religion of our Minds, which can never flouri&s;h without a good moral Behaviour; and the externals of Chri&s;tianity. Here then with that deference due to my honour'd Fathers, and Superiours, but&punc; with an earne&s;tne&s;s becoming the importance of the Subject, I a&s;k your Influence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to encourage Religion, &s;upport the Go&s;pel, and maintain Peace, Purity, and good Order in the Church. <HI>Zion</HI> always had her Enemies, the Children of <HI>Edom</HI> were not the fir&s;t, nor the la&s;t that &s;aid, ra&s;e it, ra&s;e it to the Foun|dation.

the &s;pecious: pretence of Con&s;cience. Con|&s;cience is a &s;acred Thing, and to be treated with the utmo&s;t Tenderne&s;s, but the Preten|&s;ions to it, are often made u&s;e or to cover the ba&s;e&s;t De&s;igns.</P>
<P>If under &s;uch Preten&s;ions any Number of People &s;hould apply to this Venerable A&s;&s;em|bly, to have all Laws repeal'd, that refer to eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and religious Affairs, or only to have tho&s;e repeal'd, which refer to the Temporalities of the Church,&mdash;&s;uch as re&s;pect the &s;upporting it's Officers, and the building, and repairing a Hou&s;e for GOD, if any &s;uch Reque&s;t &s;hould be prefer'd, I humble a&s;k of the Honourable A&s;&s;embly, in favour to the Government as a civil Community, to reject it with that Abhorrence which it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>Our pious Ance&s;tors, who made Provi&s;ion by Law, for the Support of a Religion, and Wor&s;hip, according to their own Con&s;ciences, in Hope of tran&s;mitting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame uncorrupt to Po&s;terity, earned their Privileges too dear, to be given up at the reque&s;t of de&s;igning Men.</P>
