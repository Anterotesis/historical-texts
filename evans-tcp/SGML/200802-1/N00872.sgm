<P>IT hath been &s;aid of Old, That Time is the Mother of Truth, and Truth is the Daughter of Time. It is the Prerogative of the God of Truth, to know all the truth in all things at once and together: <HI>It is al&s;o his Glory to con|ceal a matter, Prov. 25.2.</HI> And to bring the truth to light in that manner and mea&s;ure, and the times appointed, as it plea&s;eth him; it is our duty in all humility, and with fear and trembling to &s;earch after truth, <HI>knowing that &s;ecret things belong to God, and only things revealed belong to us,</HI> and &s;o far as they are revealed; for in many things it may be &s;aid, what God is doing we know not now; but we, or others that &s;ucceed us, &s;hall know hereafter. Omitting other Examples, I &s;hall In&s;tance only in the matter of <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> which on the Humane &s;ide, is one of the mo&s;t hidden Works of Darkne&s;s, managed by the Rulers of the darkne&s;s of this World, to the doing of great &s;poil among&s;t the Children of men: And on the Divine &s;ide, it is one of the mo&s;t awful and tremendous

Judgments of God which can be inflicted on the Societies of men, e&s;pecially when the Lord &s;hall plea&s;e for his own Holy Ends to Enlarge Satans Commi&s;&s;ion in more than an ordinary way.</P>
<P>It is known to all men, that it plea&s;ed God &s;ome few years ago, to &s;uffer Satan to rai&s;e much trouble among&s;t us in that re&s;pect, the beginning of which was very &s;mall, and looked on at fir&s;t as an ordi|nary ca&s;e which had fallen out before at &s;everal times in other places, &amp; would be quickly over. Only one or two per&s;ons belonging to <HI>Salem Village</HI> about five miles from the Town being &s;u&s;pected, were Examined, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But in the progre&s;s of the matter, a multitude of other per&s;ons both in that and other Neighbour Towns, were Accu&s;ed, Exa|mined, Impri&s;oned, and came to their Trials, at <HI>Salem,</HI> the County Town, where about Twenty of them Suffered as <HI>Witches;</HI> and many others in danger of the &s;ame Tragical End: and &s;till the number of the Accu&s;ed increa&s;ed unto many Scores; among&s;t whom were many Per&s;ons of unque&s;tionable Credit, never under any grounds of &s;u&s;picion of that or any other Scandalous Evil. This brought a gene|ral Con&s;ternation upon all &s;orts of People, doubting what would be the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch a dreadful Judg|ment of God upon the Country; but the Lord was plea&s;ed &s;uddenly to put a &s;top to tho&s;e proceedings, that there was no further trouble, as hath been re|lated by others. But it left in the minds of men a &s;ad remembrance of that &s;orrowful time; and a Doubt whether &s;ome Innocent Per&s;ons might not

There is no doubt but the Judges and Juries proceeded in their Integrity, with a zeal of God again&s;t Sin, according to their be&s;t light, and according to Law and Evidence; but there is a Que&s;tion yet un|re&s;olved, Whether &s;ome of the Laws, Cu&s;toms and Principles u&s;ed by the Judges and Juries in the Trials of <HI>Witches</HI> in <HI>England</HI> (which were fol|lowed as Patterns here) were not in&s;ufficient and un&s;afe.</P>
<P>As for my Self, being under the Infirmities of a decrepit Old Age, I &s;tirred little abroad, and was much di&s;enabled (both in body and mind) from knowing and judging of Occurrents and Tran&s;acti|ons of that time: But my Reverend Brother Mr. <HI>Hale,</HI> having for above Thirty Years, been Pa&s;tor of the Church at <HI>Beverly</HI> (but Two Miles from <HI>Salem,</HI> where the Tryals were) was frequently pre|&s;ent, and was a diligent Ob&s;erver of all that pa&s;&s;ed, and being one of a Singular Prudence and Sagacity, in &s;earching into the narrows of things: He hath (after much deliberation) in this Treati&s;e, related the Sub&s;tance of the Ca&s;e as it was, and given Rea|&s;ons from Scripture again&s;t &s;ome of the Principles &amp; Practi&s;es then u&s;ed in the Tryals of <HI>Witchcraft;</HI> and &s;aid &s;omething al&s;o in a Po&s;itive way, and &s;hewing the right Application that is to be made of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he whole, and all this in &s;uch a pious and mode&s;t manner, as cannot be offen&s;ive to any, but may be generally acceptable to all the lovers of Truth and Peace.</P>

<HEAD>The Preface TO THE Chri&s;tian READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Holy Scriptures inform us that the Doctrine of Godline&s;s is a great My&s;tery, containing the My&s;teries of the Kingdom of Heaven: My&s;te|ries which require great &s;earch for the finding out: And as the Lord hath his My&s;teries to bring us to Eternal Glory; &s;o Satan hath his My&s;teries to bring us to Eternal Ruine: My&s;|teries not ea&s;ily under&s;tood, whereby the depths of Satan are managed in hidden wayes. So the Whore of <HI>Babylon</HI> makes the <HI>Inhabitants of the Earth drunk with the Wine of her Fornication,</HI> by the My&s;tery of her abominations, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.2. And the man of Sin hath his My&s;tery of ini|quity whereby he deceiveth men through the working of Satan in &s;ignes and lying wonders, 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2 3, 7, 9.</P>
<P>And among Satans My&s;teries of iniquity, this of <HI>Witchcraft</HI> is one of the mo&s;t difficult to be &s;earched out by the Sons of men; as appeareth
<PB N="9" REF="001050_0009_0FAEF440CB8C63F0">
by the great endeavours of Learned and Holy men to &s;earch it out, and the great differences that are found among them, in the rules laid down for the bringing to light the&s;e hidden works of darkne&s;s. So that it may &s;eem pre|&s;umption in me to undertake &s;o difficult a <HI>Theam,</HI> &amp; to lay down &s;uch rules as are different from the Sentiments of many Eminent writers, and from the Pre&s;idents and practices of able Lawyers; yea and from the Common Law it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>But my Apology for this undertaking is</HI>;</P>
<P N="1">1. That there hath been &s;uch a dark di&s;pen|&s;ation by the Lord, letting loo&s;e upon us the Devil, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1691. &amp; 1692. as we never ex|perienced before: And thereupon apprehend|ing and condemning per&s;ons for <HI>Witchcraft</HI>; and nextly acquitting others no le&s;s liable to &s;uch a charge; which evidently &s;hew we were in the dark, and knew not what to do; but have gone too far on the one or other &s;ide, if not on both. Hereupon I e&s;teemed it nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome per&s;on to Collect a Summa|ry of that affair, with &s;ome animadver&s;ions up|on it, which might at lea&s;t give &s;ome light to them which come after, to &s;hun tho&s;e Rocks by which we were brui&s;ed, and narrowly e&s;|caped Shipwrack upon. And I have waited five years for &s;ome other per&s;on to undertake it, who might doe it better than I can, but find none; and judge it better to do what I can,
<PB N="10" REF="001050_0010_0FAEF441E9774F88">
than that &s;uch a work &s;hould be left undone. Better &s;incerely though weakly done, then not at all, or with &s;uch a byas of prejudice as will put fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es upon that which was managed with uprightne&s;s of heart, though there was not &s;o great a &s;pirit of di&s;cerning, as were to be wi&s;hed in &s;o weighty a Concernment.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have been pre&s;ent at &s;everal Examinati|ons and Tryals, and knew &s;undry of tho&s;e that Suffered upon that account in former years, and in this la&s;t affair, and &s;o have more advantages than a &s;tranger, to give account of the&s;e Proceedings.</P>
<P N="3">3. I have been from my Youth trained up in the knowledge and belief of mo&s;t of tho&s;e principles I here que&s;tion as un&s;afe to be u&s;ed. The fir&s;t per&s;on that &s;uffered on this account in <HI>New-England,</HI> about Fifty years &s;ince, was my Neighbour, and I heard much of what was charged upon her, and others in tho&s;e times; and the reverence I bore to aged, learned and judicious per&s;ons, cau&s;ed me to drink in their principles in the&s;e things, with a kind of Implicit Faith. <HI>Quo &s;emel e&s;t imbuta recens &s;ervabit odorem, Te&s;ta diu A Child will not ea&s;ily for&s;ake the principles he hath been trained up in from his Cradle.</HI></P>
<P>But ob&s;erving the Events of that &s;ad Ca|ta&s;trophe, <HI>Anno</HI> 1692. I was brought to a more &s;trict &s;canning of the principles I had imbibed, and by &s;canning, to que&s;tion, and by que&s;tio|ning
<PB N="11" REF="001050_0011_0FAEF4451590A140">
at length to reject many of them, upon the rea&s;ons &s;hewed in the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e. It is an approved &s;aying <HI>Nihil certius, quam quod ex dubio fit certum</HI>: No truth more certain to a man, than that which he hath formerly doubt|ed or denied, and is recovered from his error, by the convincing evidence of Scripture &amp; rea|&s;on. Yet I know and am &s;en&s;ible, that while we know but in part, man is apt in flying from a di&s;covered error, to run into the con|trary extream.</P>
<P><HI>Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybaim.</HI></P>
<P>The middle way is commonly the way of truth. And if any can &s;hew me a better mid|dle way than I have here laid down, I &s;hall be ready to embrace it: But the conviction mu&s;t not be by vinegar or drollery, but by &s;trength of argument.</P>
<P N="4">4. I have had a deep &s;ence of the &s;ad con|&s;equence of mi&s;takes in matters Capital; and their impo&s;&s;ibility of recovering when com|pleated. And what grief of heart it brings to a tender con&s;cience, to have been unwittingly encouraging of the Sufferings of the innocent. And I hope a zeal to prevent for the future &s;uch &s;ufferings is pardonable, although there &s;hould be much weakne&s;s, and &s;ome errors in the pur&s;uit thereof.</P>
<P N="5">5. I ob&s;erve the failings that have been on the one hand, have driven &s;ome into that which is indeed an extream on the other hand,
<PB N="12" REF="001050_0012_0FAEF446737D4E10">
and of dangerous con&s;equence, <HI>viz.</HI> To deny any &s;uch per&s;ons to be under the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> who by the Devils aid di&s;cover Secrets, or do work wonders. Therefore in the latter part of this di&s;cour&s;e, I have taken pains to prove the Affirmative, yet with brevity, becau&s;e it hath been done already by <HI>Perkins</HI> of <HI>Witchcraft.

Yet I would not be un|der&s;tood to ju&s;tify all his notions in tho&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es, but acknowledge he hath &s;trongly proved the being of <HI>Witches.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. I have &s;pecial rea&s;ons moving me to bear my te&s;timony about the&s;e matters, <HI>before I go hence &amp; be no more</HI>; the which I have here done, and I hope with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit to whom I commit my &s;elf &amp; this my labour, e|ven that God <HI>who&s;e I am &amp; whom I &s;erve</HI>: De|&s;iring his Mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t to Pardon all the Er|rors of his People in the day of darkne&s;s; and to en|able us to fight with Satan by Spiritural Weapons, putting on the whole Armour of God.</P>

But it is not my purpo&s;e to give a full relation of all that have &s;uffered for that Sin, or of all the particulars charged upon them, which probably is now impo&s;&s;ible, many wit|ne&s;&s;ing <HI>Viva voce,</HI> tho&s;e particulars which were not fully recorded. But that I chiefly intend is to &s;hew the principles formerly acted upon in Convicting of that Crime; which were &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t great principle laid down by a per&s;on Eminent for Wi&s;dom, Piety and Learn|ing was; That the Devil could not a&s;&s;ume the &s;hape of an innocent per&s;on in doing mi&s;chiefs unto mankind: for if the Lord &s;hould &s;uffer him in this he would &s;ubvert the cour&s;e of hu|mane Ju&s;tice, by bringing men to &s;uffer for what he did in their Shapes.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Witchcraft</HI> being an habitual Crime, one &s;ingle witne&s;s to one Act of Witchcraft, and a|nother
<PB N="21" REF="001050_0021_0FAEF44CCBBFC830">
&s;ingle witne&s;s to another &s;uch fact, made two witne&s;&s;es again&s;t the Crime and the party &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P N="3">3. There was &s;earching of the bodies of the &s;u&s;pected for &s;uch like tears, or &s;pots (which writers &s;peak of) called the Devils marks; and if found, the&s;e were accounted a pre&s;umption at lea&s;t of guilt in tho&s;e that had them.</P>
<P N="4">4. I ob&s;erved that people laid great weight upon this; when things &s;uppo&s;ed to be bewitch|ed were burnt, and the &s;u&s;pected per&s;on came to the fire in the time of it. Although that E|minent per&s;on above &s;aid condemned this way of tryal, as going to the Devil to find the Devil.</P>
<P N="5">5. If after anger between Neighbours mi&s;|chief followed, this oft bred &s;u&s;picion of Witch|craft in the matter. In fine, the pre&s;umptions and convictions u&s;ed in former times were for &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame which we may read of in <HI>Keeble</HI> of the Common Law, and in <HI>Bernard,</HI> &amp; other Authors of that &s;ubject.</P>

Yet the Governour <HI>Simon Brad&s;treet</HI> E&s;q and &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates repreived her, being un&s;atisfy|ed in the Verdict upon the&s;e grounds.</P>
<P N="1">1. They were not &s;atisfyed that a Specter doing mi&s;chief in her likene&s;s, &s;hould be impu|ted to her per&s;on, as a ground of guilt.</P>

She being reprived, was carried to her own home, and her Husband, (who was e&s;teemed a Sincere and under&s;tand|ing Chri&s;tian by tho&s;e that knew him) de&s;ired &s;ome Neighbour Mini&s;ters, of whom I was one, to meet together and di&s;cour&s;e his Wife; the which we did: and her di&s;cour&s;e was very Chri&s;tian among us, and &s;till pleaded her inno|cence as to that which was laid to her charge.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. IN the latter end of the year 1691. Mr. <HI>Samuel Paris,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the Church in <HI>Salem-Village,</HI> had a Daughter of Nine, and a Neice of about Eleven years of Age, &s;adly Af|flicted of they knew not what Di&s;tempers; and he made his application to Phy&s;itians, yet &s;till they grew wor&s;e: And at length one Phy&s;iti|an gave his opinion, that they were under an Evil Hand. This the Neighbours quickly took up, and concluded they were bewitched. He had al&s;o an Indian Man &s;ervant, and his Wife who afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, that without the knowledge of their Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s, they had taken &s;ome of the Afflicted per&s;ons Urine, and mixing it with meal had made a Cake, &amp; baked it, to find out the Witch, as they &s;aid.
<PB N="24" REF="001050_0024_0FAEF451DC42B208">
After this, the Afflicted per&s;ons cryed out of the Indian Woman, named <HI>Tituba,</HI> that &s;he did pinch, prick, and grievou&s;ly torment them, and that they &s;aw her here and there, where no body el&s;e could. Yea they could tell where &s;he was, and what &s;he did, when out of their humane &s;ight. The&s;e Children were biuen and pinched by invi&s;ible agents; their arms, necks, and backs turned this way and that way, and returned back again, &s;o as it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to do of them&s;elves, and beyond the power of any Epileptick Fits, or natural Di&s;ea&s;e to effect. Sometimes they were taken dumb, their mouths &s;topped, their throats choaked, their limbs wracked and, tormented &s;o as might move an heart of &s;tone, to &s;ympa|thize with them, with bowels of compa&s;&s;ion for them. I will not enlarge in the de&s;cripti|on of their cruel Sufferings, becau&s;e they were in all things afflicted as bad as <HI>John Good|wins</HI> Children at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in the year 1689. So that he that will read Mr. <HI>Mathers</HI> Book of <HI>Memorable Providences, page</HI> 3. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may Read part of what the&s;e Children, and afterwards &s;undry grown per&s;ons &s;uffered by the hand of Satan, at <HI>Salem</HI> Village, and parts adjacent, <HI>Anno</HI> 1691, 2. Yet there was more in the&s;e Sufferings, than in tho&s;e at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> by pins in|vi&s;ibly &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck into their fle&s;h, pricking with I|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons.

<PB N="25" REF="001050_0025_0FAEF45396728178">
Mr. <HI>Paris</HI> &s;eeing the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition of his Family, de&s;ired the pre&s;ence of &s;ome Wor|thy Gentlemen of <HI>Salem,</HI> and &s;ome Neighbour Mini&s;ters to con&s;ult together at his Hou&s;e; who when they came, and had enquired dili|gently into the Sufferings of the Afflicted, con|cluded they were preternatural, and feared the hand of Satan was in them.</P>
<P N="2">II. The advice given to Mr. <HI>Paris</HI> by them was, that he &s;hould &s;it &s;till and wait upon the Providence of God to &s;ee what time might di&s;cover; and to be much in prayer for the di&s;covery of what was yet &s;ecret. They al&s;o Examined <HI>Tituba,</HI> who confe&s;&s;ed the making a Cake, as is above mentioned, and &s;aid her Mi&s;tre&s;s in her own Country was a Witch, and had taught her &s;ome means to be u&s;ed for the di&s;covery of a Witch and for the pre|vention of being bewitched, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But &s;aid that &s;he her &s;elf was not a Witch.</P>
<P N="3">III. Soon after this, there were two or three private Fa&s;ts at the Mini&s;ters Hou&s;e, one of which was kept by &s;undry Neighbour Mini|&s;ters, and after this, another in Publick at the <HI>Village,</HI> and &s;everal days afterwards of publick Humiliation, during the&s;e mole&s;tations, not only there, but in other Congregations for them. And one General Fa&s;t by Order of the General Court, ob&s;erved throughout the

Colony to &s;eek the Lord that he would rebuke Satan, and be a light unto his people in this day of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>But I return to the Hi&s;tory of the&s;e trou|bles. In a &s;hort time after other per&s;ons who were of age to be witne&s;&s;es, were mole&s;ted by Satan, and in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">its cryed out upon <HI>Tituba</HI> and Goody O. &amp; S. G. that they or Specters in their Shapes did grievou&s;ly torment them; hereupon &s;ome of their Village Neighbours complained to the Magi&s;trates at <HI>Salem,</HI> de&s;iring they would come and examine the afflicted &amp; accu&s;ed together; the which they did: the effect of which examination was, that <HI>Tituba</HI> confe&s;&s;ed &s;he was a Witch, and that &s;he with the two others accu&s;ed did torment &amp; bewitch the complainers, and that the&s;e with two others who&s;e names &s;he knew not, had their Witch|meeting together; relating the times when &amp; places where they met, with many other cir|cum&s;tances to be &s;een at large. Upon this the &s;aid <HI>Tituba</HI> and O. &amp; <HI>S. G.</HI> were committed to Pri&s;on upon &s;u&s;picion of acting Witchcraft. After this the &s;aid <HI>Tituba</HI> was again examined in Pri&s;on, and owned her fir&s;t confe&s;&s;ion in all points, and then was her &s;elf afflicted and com|plained of her fellow Witches tormenting of her, for her confe&s;&s;ion, and accu&s;ing them, and being &s;earched by a Woman, &s;he was found to have upon her body the marks of the Devils wounding of her.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="27" REF="001050_0027_0FAEF455150CE698">IV. Here were the&s;e things rendred her confe&s;&s;ion credible. (1.) That at this exami|nation &s;he an&s;wered every que&s;tion ju&s;t as &s;he did at the fir&s;t. And it was thought that if &s;he had feigned her confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he could not have remembred her an&s;wers &s;o exactly. A lyar we &s;ay, had need of a good memory, but truth being always con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf is the &s;ame to day as it was ye&s;terday. (2.) She &s;eemed very penitent for her Sin in covenanting with the Devil. (3.) She became a &s;ufferer her &s;elf, &amp; as &s;he &s;aid for her confe&s;&s;ion. (4.) Her confe&s;&s;ion agreed exactly (which was after|wards verified in the other confe&s;&s;ors) with the accu&s;ations of the afflicted. Soon after the&s;e afflicted per&s;ons complained of other per|&s;ons afflicting of them in their fits, and the number of the afflicted and accu&s;ed began to increa&s;e. And the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Tituba</HI>'s confe&s;&s;i|on encouraged tho&s;e in Authority to examine others that were &s;u&s;pected, and the event was, that more confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves guilty of the Crimes they were &s;u&s;pected for. And thus was this matter driven on.</P>
<P N="5">V. I ob&s;erved in the pro&s;ecution of the&s;e affairs, that there was in the Ju&s;tices, Judges &amp; others concerned, a con&s;cientious endeavour to do the thing that was right. And to that end they con&s;ulted the Pre&s;idents of former times &amp; precepts laid down by Learned Writers about

<P N="6">VI. But that which chiefly carried on this matter to &s;uch an height, was the increa&s;ing of confe&s;&s;ors till they amounted to near about Fifty: and four or &s;ix of them upon their try|als owned their guilt of this crime, and were condemned for the &s;ame, but not Executed. And many of the confe&s;&s;ors confirmed their confe&s;&s;ions with very &s;trong circum&s;tances: As their exact agreement with the accu&s;ations of the afflicted; their punctual agreement with their fellow confe&s;&s;ors; their relating the times when they covenanted with Satan, and the rea|&s;ons that moved them thereunto; their Witch meetings, and that they had their mock Sacra|ments of Bapti&s;m and the Supper, in &s;ome of them; their &s;igning the Devils book: and &s;ome &s;hewed the Scars of the wounds which they &s;aid were made to fetch blood with, to &s;ign the Devils book; and &s;ome &s;aid they had

<P N="7">VII. I &s;hall give the Reader a ta&s;t of the&s;e things in a few In&s;tances. The Afflicted complained that the Spectres which vexed them, urged them to &s;et their Hands to a Book repre&s;ented to them (as to them it &s;ee|med) with threatnings of great torments, if they &s;igned not, and promi&s;es of ea&s;e if they obeyed.</P>

and others. Yet experience &s;hewed, that the more there were apprehended, the more were &s;till Afflicted by Satan, and the number of Confe&s;&s;ors increa&s;ing, did but in|crea&s;e the number of the Accu&s;ed, and the Executing &s;ome, made way for the apprehen|ding of others; for &s;till the Afflicted com|plained of being tormented by new objects&punc; as the former were removed.

<P>HEre was generally acknowledged to be an error (at lea&s;t on the one hand) but the Querie is, Wherein?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. I have heard it &s;aid, That the Pre&s;i|dents in <HI>England</HI> were not &s;o exactly followed, becau&s;e in tho&s;e there had been previous quar|rels and threatnings of the Afflicted by tho&s;e that were Condemned for Witchcraft; but here, &s;ay they, not &s;o. To which I an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="1">1. In many of the&s;e ca&s;es there had been antecedent per&s;onal quarrels, and &s;o occa&s;ions of revenge; for &s;ome of tho&s;e Condemned, had been &s;u&s;pected by their Neighbours &s;eve|ral years, becau&s;e after quarrelling with their Neighbours, evils had befallen tho&s;e Neigh|bours. As may be &s;een in the Printed Tryals of <HI>S. M.</HI> and <HI>B. B.</HI> and others: See <HI>Wonders of the Invi&s;ible World, Page</HI> 105. to 137. And
<PB N="38" REF="001050_0038_0FAEF45F8F2FD140">
there were other like Ca&s;es not Printed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Several confe&s;&s;ors acknowledged they en|gaged in the quarrels of other their confede|rates to afflict per&s;ons. As one <HI>Timothy Swan</HI> &s;uffered great thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by Witchcrafts, as he &s;up|po&s;ed and te&s;tifye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; And &s;everal of the con|fe&s;&s;ors &s;aid they did &s;o torment him for the &s;ake of one of their partners who had &s;ome offence offer'd her by the &s;aid <HI>Swan</HI>&punc; And others owned they did the like in the behalf of &s;ome of their confederates.</P>
<P N="3">3 There were others that confe&s;&s;ed their fellow&s;hip in the&s;e works of darkne&s;s, was to de&s;troy the Church of God (as is above in part rehear&s;ed) which is a greater piece of revenge, then to be avenged upon one particular per&s;on.</P>
<P N="2">2. It may be queried then, <HI>How doth it ap|pear that there was a going too far in this affair</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 1. By the numbers of the per&s;ons accu&s;ed which at length increa&s;ed to about an <HI>hundred,</HI> and it cannot be imagined that in a place of &s;o much knowledge, &s;o many in &s;o &s;mall a com|pa&s;s of Land &s;hould &s;o abominably leap into the Devils lap at once.</P>
<P N="2">2. The quality of &s;everal of the accu&s;ed was &s;uch as did be&s;peak better things, <HI>and things that accompany Salvation.</HI> Per&s;ons who&s;e blamele&s;s and holy lives before did te&s;tify for them. Per&s;ons that had taken great pains to bring up their <HI>Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord</HI>: Such as we had Charity for, as for our
<PB N="39" REF="001050_0039_0FAEF460B398E0A8">
own Souls: and Charity is a Chri&s;tian duty commended to us. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. <HI>Chapt. Col.</HI> 3.14. and in many other Scriptures.</P>
<P N="3">3. The number of the afflicted by Satan dayly increa&s;ed, till about Fifty per&s;ons were thus vexed by the Devil. This gave ju&s;t ground to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome mi&s;take, which gave advantage to the accu&s;er of the Brethren to make a breach upon us.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was con&s;iderable that Nineteen were Executed, and all denyed the Crime to the Death, and &s;ome of them were knowing per|&s;ons, &amp; had before this been accounted blame|le&s;s livers. And it is not to be imagined, but that if all had been guilty, &s;ome would have had &s;o much tenderne&s;s as to &s;eek Mercy for their Souls in the way of Confe&s;&s;ion &amp; &s;orrow for &s;uch a Sin. And as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the condemned con|fe&s;&s;ors at the Bar, (they being reprieved) we had no experience whether they would &s;tand to their Self-condemning confe&s;&s;ions, when they came to dye.</P>
<P N="5">5. When this pro&s;ecution cea&s;ed, the Lord &s;o chained up Satan, that the afflicted grew pre|&s;ently well. The accu&s;ed are generally quiet, and for five years &s;ince, we have no &s;uch mo|le&s;tations by them.</P>
<P N="6">6. It &s;ways much with me that I have &s;ince heard and read, of the like mi&s;takes in o|ther places. As in <HI>Suffolk</HI> in <HI>England</HI> about the year 1645, was &s;uch a pro&s;ecution, until they

&s;aw that unle&s;s they put a &s;top it would bring all into blood and confu&s;ion. The like hath been in <HI>France,</HI> till 900 were put to Death. And in &s;ome other places the like; So that <HI>N. England</HI> is not the only place circumvented by the wiles of the wicked and wi&s;ely Serpent in this kind.</P>

<P>If there were an Error in the proceedings in other places, and in <HI>N.

<P N="3">3 Satan per&s;onating the innocent in doing mi&s;chief is no prejudice to Civil Ju&s;tice, if it can be found out that the mi&s;chief &s;o done is the act of Satan, and not the act of the per&s;on repre&s;ented.

A Spectre can come in by a pin-hole: but Satan cannot bring in the body of a man or woman in at &s;uch a place: for if &s;o then Sa|tan could work a miracle property &s;o called, which he cannot do.

full proportion and then changed into the form of another Creature, as a Cat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is a Spectre not the per&s;on. The turning <HI>Lots</HI> Wife into a pillar of Salt was a proper Mira|cle beyond the power of Devil or Angel of them&s;elves to perform. But a Spectre can change its &s;hape like the Wind under Ice run|ning upon the water. This well weighed will confute many fond Stories that have pa&s;&s;ed, that &s;uch a Woman is a Witch, for &s;he was &s;een in her full proportion, and then turned into a Cat, and back at la&s;t into a Woman; for all this was either a phanta&s;ie in the brains, or a Phanta&s;ma before the Eyes.</P>
<P N="5">5 If a per&s;on (or &s;o e&s;teemed) pa&s;s by us on the &s;oft Snow, or dirt, and leave no foot|&s;teps behind them, this is to be e&s;teemed a Spectre, and not the real per&s;on, unle&s;s the per|&s;on were carried by Satan in the Air. This was brought for an Evidence again&s;t a Wo|man, that &s;he was &s;een nigh <HI>Malden</HI> in a Moon&s;hiny night pa&s;&s;ing on the Snow, and left no foot&s;teps behind her; when &s;he might be in her Hou&s;e at <HI>Newbury,</HI> and either the Phanta&s;ie of the Witne&s;s was abu&s;ed, or a Spectre pa&s;&s;ed by him in her Image. Yet if it had been her per&s;on &s;o carried by Satan, this would not prove her a Witch, unle&s;s her con&s;ent were given to it. <HI>Goodwins</HI> Children were carried in the Air by Satan, as &s;aith <HI>Me|morable Providences.

If the prints of biting of teeth, pinching with fingers, pricking with pins or irons be made on the Bodies of the Afflicted, and no hand, mouth or Body can be &s;een or felt to do it, this is to be imputed to Satan, and not to a real per&s;on doing of it.</P>
<P>By the&s;e or &s;uch like means, due circum|&s;pection being u&s;ed, when Satan per&s;onates the innocent, his fallacy and malice may be di&s;covered, at lea&s;t ordinarily. Yet if the Lord &s;hould &s;uffer Satan &s;o to act, and not be di&s;covered after all means u&s;ed to find the fal|lacy (which I never yet read or heard he did) this mu&s;t be reckoned among the un&s;earcha|ble acts of Divine Soveraignty, which men may humbly admire; but not make rules up|on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;al for humane judicature to proceed upon. The&s;e premi&s;es con&s;idered, we may inter, That if Satan may per&s;onate an innocent party to one tormented by him; then, if the Lord permit it, to two, yea to ten.

<P>ANother Principle much in&s;i&s;ted on, is; That the Devil when he doth harm to per&s;ons in their Body or E&s;tate, it is (at lea&s;t mo&s;t commonly, generally and frequent|ly) by the help of our Neighbour: That is, &s;ome Witch or Conjurer, or &s;uch like in Cove|nant with the Devil. Sir <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> in his Printed Ob&s;ervations upon the Tryal of tho&s;e Witches he Condemned, (Printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1682) draws this inference from hence, That
<PB N="52" REF="001050_0052_0FAEF4701008A510">
the Devil when he hurts the Body or Goods of men, is in &s;ome &s;ort &s;ubject to Humane Ju&s;tice, though not in him&s;elf, yet in his Co|venant Servants, by whom he is &s;et a work to do &s;uch mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>The un&s;oundne&s;s of this principle appeareth by the Scripture in&s;tances of Satans &s;o afflict|ing man when we read of no Witch to &s;et him on work. As,</P>

<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. We have many In&s;tances of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the unclean Spirits that were tormented and vexed by Satan, to quicken men to prayer, <HI>Mat.</HI> 17.21. and to &s;hew Chri&s;ts power.</P>
<P N="5">5. Some by their own pre&s;umptuous deal|ing with Satan, have given him power, or at lea&s;t opportunity to &s;trip and wound them; as the <HI>Exorci&s;ts, Acts</HI> 19.13. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Seeing then we have &s;o many in&s;tances of Satans afflicting, without Witches help, and no clear Scripture in&s;tance of his afflicting

mankind in Body, or E&s;tate by Witchcraft; It's un&s;afe to conclude generally that tho&s;e that are under Diabolical mole&s;tations are be|witched. For when per&s;ons are per&s;waded their Relations are bewitched, they pre&s;ently enquire, who is the Witch? and who &s;hould they fa&s;ten their &s;u&s;picions upon, but on the&s;e that the Afflicted cry out again&s;t in their fits?</P>

<P>And we find the two men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, <HI>Matth.</HI> 8. 23 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had like fits, for both kept among the Tombs, both were exceeding fierce, &s;o as to hinder per&s;ons pa&s;&s;ing that way, both together made the &s;ame outcry to Je&s;us, that he &s;hould not torment them. The&s;e things &s;hew a unity among the Devils afflicting them: but no unity of Witches joyning with them.</P>
<P>Fourth &s;ign is, When the afflicted out of their fits know nothing what they did, or &s;aid in them. But this (if our ob&s;e&s;&s;ed or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed per&s;ons &s;aid truly) often fell out in the tormen|ted at <HI>Salem.</HI></P>
<P>Fifth &s;ign, Supernatural &s;trength in their fits. Now this is a &s;ign of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, <HI>Mark</HI> 5.4. Who in their fits brake chaines and fetters.</P>
<P>Sixth &s;ign is, When the afflicted vomit pins, nailes, irons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To this I &s;ay, whether the&s;e pins, nailes, <HI>&amp;c</HI> are by the Devil brought invi|&s;ibly to the mouths of the per&s;ons &s;o vomiting and &s;o ca&s;t out from their mouths, but not out of their &s;tomacks or throats; or whether they are in&s;en&s;ibly conveyed by the working of Satan into the &s;tomacks or throats of the per&s;ons vo|miting, and &s;o vomited forth, neither the one
<PB N="57" REF="001050_0057_0FAEF4754E09A4A8">
nor the other, can certainly prove the vomiter bewitched, unle&s;s it be made manife&s;t that Sa|tan doth thus vex the party by confederacy with a Witch. But where Satan hath a per|mi&s;&s;ion to vex and po&s;&s;e&s;s a per&s;on he may do the&s;e things, as well as other things he did unto the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mentioned in the Go&s;pels.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh &s;ign is, The afflicted per&s;on having the &s;ight of the apparition of the &s;u&s;|pected party, and when the mi&s;chief of a fit or the like following &s;hortly after. Now it hav|ing been already proved, that Satan can repre|&s;ent, to tho&s;e that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, innocent per|&s;ons: it is not to be wondered that Satan &s;hould repre&s;ent to the eyes or imagination of a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufferer, a Spectre repre&s;enting a &s;u&s;pected innocent per&s;on ju&s;t before he ca&s;teth them into a fit, e&s;pecially &s;eeing hereby he gaines upon the credulity of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and their friends, for the accu&s;ing an innocent, and it may be a godly per&s;on; for this helps for|ward his de&s;ign as the accu&s;er of the brethren. <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.10.</P>
<P>I would then from the&s;e con&s;iderations infer, That if a party handled as in the &s;even par|ticulars above expre&s;&s;ed, cannot thereby be &s;aid to be bewitched, Then there is no need, unle&s;s &s;omewhat el&s;e appear, to trouble our &s;elves to enquire who is the Witch that troubleth &s;uch a party.</P>

<P N="3">3. ANother principle improved in the&s;e Enquiries is, When the party &s;u&s;pe|cted looks upon the parties &s;uppo&s;ed to be be|witched, and they are thereupon &s;truck down into a fit, as if &s;truck with a Cudgel. This bewitching by the eye is an opinion Seventeen Hundred years old,
<Q><P>Ne&s;cio quis-teneros oculis mihi fa&s;cinat agnos.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Virgil.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gaul</HI> in his Book, Printed 1648. page 128. Saith, <HI>Some Witches by in&s;pecting, or looking on, but to a glance, or &s;quint, or peep at with an envious eye, is &s;ufficient to effa&s;cinate.</HI> And we may find much u&s;e made of this experiment in Tryals in <HI>England</HI> mentioned by <HI>Baxter, Glanvil</HI> and <HI>Burton.</HI> And however this &s;eem|ed a pre&s;umption at <HI>Salem Village,</HI> yet at length it was apparent to be a delu&s;ion of Satan. For this experiment was found at the Tryals of per&s;ons when the Accu&s;ed &s;ought to clear them&s;elves, and it cannot be conceived that then they would act Witchcraft to ha&s;ten their own Condemnation: And no per&s;on can be &s;aid to act Witchcraft again&s;t their own will and con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Again, we read, <HI>Mark</HI> 9.20. That when the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was brought unto Chri&s;t, and &s;aw Chri&s;t, then the Spirit tare him, and he fell to the ground and wallowed foaming. So
<PB N="59" REF="001050_0059_0FAEF476CB2F9DF0">
that the Devil cho&s;e this time and place to ca&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed into a fit even in the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t. Let us then con&s;ider the&s;e Afflict|ed to be Demoniacks, and we mu&s;t own, it's in Satans power to ca&s;t them into a fit in the pre&s;ence, and upon the &s;ight of the Accu&s;ed. And if this may increa&s;e the &s;u&s;picion again&s;t the Accu&s;ed, it's for his intere&s;t to chu&s;e &s;uch a time.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another pre&s;umption made u&s;e of hath been to cau&s;e the &s;u&s;pected to touch the party &s;uppo&s;ed to be bewitched, and if that touch bring the party out of their fit, this hath been e&s;teemed by many a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion at lea&s;t, as may be read in &s;ome of the fore cited Au|thors.</P>
<P>And Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lanvil</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth a Philo&s;ophical rea&s;on for it, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Witch by the ca&s;t of her eye &s;ends forth a Malefick Venome into the Bewitched to ca&s;t him into a fit, and therefore the touch of the hand doth by a &s;ympathy cau&s;e that venome to return into the Body of the Witch again. As when a per&s;on is &s;tung by a Snake, the application of the Body or fle&s;h of the &s;ame Snake to the wound will draw back the poy&s;on into its former fountain. But the truth is both the&s;e effects depend upon the Devils free agency: And he frames his things much according to the opinion of the Spectators, with intent to deceive. I never could &s;ee rea&s;on to ju&s;ti|fy
<PB N="60" REF="001050_0060_0FAEF477DA4C0670">
&s;uch a kind of Tryal (though allowed by <HI>Bernard</HI> as lawful to be u&s;ed;) but &s;ince I have more con&s;idered it, I look upon it very unwarrantable to be u&s;ed, being as it were the putting a &s;taff into the hand of Satan, to try what he will do with it. For the recovery of the party out of the Fit hereby mu&s;t be from a natural or divine cau&s;e, or from the Devil&punc; We cannot prove either of the two former and if the third, its but the Devils te&s;timony, and therefore not to be u&s;ed by us.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another practice hath been when the party &s;u&s;pected is in Pri&s;on, and the Afflicted cry out they are mi&s;erably tormented by them; If then the &s;u&s;pected party be bound, and the afflicted per&s;on thereupon, have ea&s;e or relea&s;e of their fits, then this is a pre&s;umption that the &s;u&s;pected party is guilty. This was u&s;ed at <HI>I&s;anbal, Anno</HI> 1661. (&s;ee <HI>Glanvil, page</HI> 168.) and the &s;ucce&s;s an&s;wered the expectati|on.</P>
<P>But this is no ground &s;o much as of &s;u&s;pici|on, becau&s;e it depends either upon &s;ome phy&s;i|cal efficacy in binding to give the party ea&s;e, or upon the precontract of the &s;u&s;pected made with Satan, or from the voluntary act of the Devil cea&s;ing to afflict at &s;uch a time; neither of the two former can be proved: not any phy&s;ical vertue in the binding the party; for how can cords bind a Spirit, and as for the
<PB N="61" REF="001050_0061_0FAEF47BB2D9FD78">
Contract with Satan, that remains yet to be proved, and if &s;uch there be, yet the terms of it are to us unknown; and the Devil being a Lyar from the beginning, will keep or break his own promi&s;es, &s;o as &s;uites the intere&s;t of his Kingdom. So that in &s;uch ca&s;es we can a&s;cribe the relea&s;e of the afflicted only to Sa|tans agency and policy by &s;uch a vile abu&s;ing the mi&s;chief of tho&s;e which make the tryal.</P>
<P N="6">6. The like is to be &s;aid when a Demoni|ack finds ea&s;e of their fits upon the apprehend|ing, or condemning, or Execution of the per|&s;on complained again&s;t. For that ea&s;e may come by Satans policy, de&s;i&s;ting his rage to confirm our error: or from Divine Favour in an&s;wer of prayer, or pity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER. VIII.</HEAD>
<P N="7">7. A Seventh principle is, If the party &s;u&s;|pected appear in Spectre to the af|flicted, and the afflicted give a blow with a knife, &s;word, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unto the Spectre (or &s;ome other in their behalf) and the Spectre &s;eems wound|ed, or bleeding, or to have their garment torn, or &s;lit by the blow received. And that the party Spectrally repre&s;ented be pre&s;ently &s;earch|ed, and there is found upon their body a wound, or blood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on the &s;ame part of their body, or a rent, or cut upon the &s;ame part of
<PB N="62" REF="001050_0062_0FAEF47D131106F8">
the garment, which appeared upon the Spectre unto the afflicted. This hath been counted a &s;trong evidence to prove the party &s;u&s;pected to be a confederate with Satan in afflicting t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> complainer. As by Judge <HI>Archer</HI> in <HI>Coxes</HI> ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Executed at <HI>Taunton, Anno</HI> 1663. (See <HI>Glanv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> part</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 196) But let us &s;earch this to the bottom; and there is no ground of &s;u&s;picion in &s;uch a kind of probation. For the ground of the &s;u&s;picion ari&s;eth hence <HI>viz.</HI> That what wound or mark is given to the Spectre (that is to the Devils aerial a&s;&s;umed body) is tran&s;la|ted thence unto the per&s;on &s;etting this Spectre on work to afflict; or to their garments, if the mark be on that. But we have no &s;ufficient ground to know this.</P>
<P N="1">1. For if it mu&s;t be &s;o, it mu&s;t be either (1.) From &s;ome &s;ympathy in nature between the Spectre and the party repre&s;ented by it. But this we have no ground in rea&s;on to conclude; for whence or how &s;hould &s;uch a &s;ympathy be between an humane body, and the Devil in the Image or likene&s;s of it? Or if it were, how can there come &s;uch a &s;ympathy between the garment of a per&s;on and the Devil appearing in the likene&s;s of that garment? Surely the garment was not in any league with Satan? (2) Or this comes to pa&s;s by vertue of the Co|venant between Satan and this confederate: if &s;o we &s;ay, I ask how come we to know there is &s;uch an article in the bargain with the De|vil?
<PB N="63" REF="001050_0063_0FAEF47D8A511530">
or if we know there were &s;uch an article in their agreement, how can we tell, that the Devil will &s;tand to his own Covenant? Or, (3.) This comes to pa&s;s by the Immediate hand of God making &s;uch a tran&s;lation of a wound <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unto a Witch that they may thereby be di&s;covered; which if &s;o, it is preternatural if not &s;upernatural. And we have no ground from Scripture to expect &s;uch a &s;ign from God; and therefore to expect it is to be guilty of the &s;in of that Wicked Generation, that &s;ought after a &s;ign. <HI>Math.</HI> 16.4. <HI>Which &s;hould not be given to them.</HI> Or (4) This tran&s;lation cometh (if there be any &s;uch) from the Devil as a free &amp; powerful Spirit, afflicting the body or affecting the garment &s;o marked: And if it be from hence, its the Devils te&s;timony which ought to be no credit with mankind.</P>
<P N="2">2. The true &s;tate of this ca&s;e &s;eems to be this; That the per&s;on or garment &s;o repre&s;en|ted to the Afflicted by a Spectre was wound|ed, or bleeding, or cut or rent before. And the Devil knowing this, repre&s;ents to the afflicted (or &s;triker at the Spectre) that part of the Spectre which an&s;wers the Body wounded, or garment rent or torn, the Searchers finding &s;uch wounds upon, or rents about the per&s;on &s;u&s;pected are ready to conclude it was done by the &s;troke at the Spectre which was done before. I &s;hall confirm this by in&s;tances.</P>
<P>There was at <HI>Ghelmsford,</HI> an Afflicted per|&s;on,
<PB N="64" REF="001050_0064_0FAEF47E4C52E840">
that in her fits cryed out again&s;t a Wo|man, a Neighbour, which Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> the Mi|ni&s;ter of the Go&s;pel there could not believe guilty of &s;uch a Crime. And it hapned while that woman was milking her Cow, the Cow &s;truck her with one horn upon her Forehead and fetched blood, and while &s;he was bleeding, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Spectre in her likene&s;s appeared to the party Afflicted, who pointing at the Spectre, one &s;truck at the place, and the Afflicted &s;aid, you have made her forehead bleed. Hereupon &s;ome went to the woman, and found her fore|head bloody, and acquainted Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> with it; who forthwith went to the woman, and asked how her forehead became bloody, and &s;he an&s;wered by a blow of the Cows horn, as above &s;aid, whereby he was &s;atisfied that it was a de&s;ign of Satan to render an innocent per&s;on &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance was at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> about fourty years &s;ince: There was a man much troubled in the night with Cats, or the Devil in their likene&s;s haunting of him, whereupon he kept a light burning, and a Sword by him as he lay in bed; for he &s;u&s;pected a Widow woman to &s;end the&s;e Cats or Imps by Witch|craft to bewitch him. And one night as he lay in bed, a Cat or Imp came within his reach, and he &s;truck her on the back; and upon enquiry heard this Widow had a &s;ore back: this confirmed his &s;u&s;picion of the Wi|dow,
<PB N="65" REF="001050_0065_0FAEF47F09EEC920">
he &s;uppo&s;ing that it came from the wound he gave the Cat. But Mr. <HI>Day</HI> the Widows Chyrurgeon cleared the matter; &s;ay|ing, this Widow came to him and complained of a &s;ore in her back, and becau&s;e &s;he could not &s;ee it, de&s;ired his help; and he found it to be a Boyl, and ripened and healed it as he u&s;ed to do other Boyls But while this was in cure, the &s;uppo&s;ed Cat was wounded as al|ready rehear&s;ed.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay when &s;uch wounds or rents come, it's not the Spectre that's &s;truck but the real per&s;on or garment is there pre&s;ent, but by vertue of the Charm, or Witchcraft, a mi&s;t is ca&s;t between the Witch and Spectators in the room, whereby the per&s;on becomes in|vi&s;ible to all of them except the bewitched Sufferer. As &s;ome juglers have &s;eemed to creep through a Tree or Log, when indeed its only upon the Tree or Log; but by inchantment a &s;hadow of the Log or Cloud is ca&s;t over the Log between the Jugler and Spectators, where|by they are deceived.</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, If it were &s;o, then tho&s;e that &s;trike with Sword, or other In&s;trument, and wound the party might feel &s;ome body, or garment &s;topping the force of their blow; for a Body can be felt if it cannot be &s;een, as a|bove &s;hewed. But when the &s;tricken in&s;tru|ment feels no harder &s;ub&s;tance than Air to &s;top its force, and there &s;eems to be a per&s;on in the

way to the Afflicted's eye: We may conclude its but a Spectre, or deluded imagination.</P>

<P N="8">8. IF after Cur&s;ing there follows Death, or at lea&s;t &s;ome mi&s;chief: This &s;aith <HI>Per|kins</HI> (in his Di&s;cour&s;e of Witchcraft, <HI>Chap.</HI> 7. <HI>Sect.</HI> 2.) This is a pre&s;umption. For Witches are wont to practi&s;e their mi&s;chievous facts by cur&s;ing and banning. This al&s;o is a &s;ufficient matter of Examination.</P>
<P>I acknowledge when per&s;ons cur&s;e or threa|ten others to kill them, or do other mi&s;chief to their Bodies or E&s;tates, and the mi&s;chief threat|ned is performed as threatned; here is ground &s;o far to &s;u&s;pect the theatner, as to que&s;tion them about it, unle&s;s it appeareth to be per|formed by &s;ome other per&s;on or cau&s;e.

unruly tongues, that their mouth is dayly full of cur&s;ing and bitterne&s;s, <HI>Rom</HI> 3.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. There be few Hou&s;e-keepers, where are many in Family and a Stock about them; but that by the hand of God, Death at &s;ome times enters upon &s;ome per&s;on in the Family, and Cattel &s;ometimes dye by Di&s;ea&s;es and Ca&s;ual|ties: Who is there that hath an E&s;tate, but at &s;ome times they meet with lo&s;&s;es?</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it falls out that the&s;e calamities, &s;ome of them happen at or nigh &s;ome one time of their angry neighbours cur&s;ing, who had cur&s;ed them ten times before, or threatned them, and yet no &s;uch calamity en&s;ued. And this their la&s;t threatning had no more influence upon the evil befalling the Family, than the ten cau&s;ele&s;s Cur&s;es that went before, as <HI>Prov.</HI> 26.2. What then doth all this prove? A tongue &s;et on fire, and it may be from hell; but not a Covenant with Hell to procure the calamities that befal their Neighbours.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ome are of &s;uch a &s;u&s;picious tem|per, that they are apt to impute all &s;ad acci|dents that do befal them, to proceed from Witchcraft, and thereby in &s;uffering times are apt to be jealous of their Neighbours that come frequently to their Hou&s;es in their day of ad|ver&s;ity, as cau&s;ers of the&s;e afflictions by &s;ome charming or inchantment.</P>
<P>Again, It may be Queried, Whether Satan may not &s;ometimes take advantage upon the
<PB N="68" REF="001050_0068_0FAEF4837273A640">
times when neighbours contend with, and threaten tho&s;e that live by them, to do &s;ome hurt to the Bodies or Goods of tho&s;e threat|ned, that thereby he may ca&s;t upon the party threatned, the imputation of Sorcery. Doubt|le&s;s as he is <HI>the Accu&s;er of the Brethren, Rev.</HI> 12 He would &s;o do if the Lord will permit him to indanger the life of the threatner. And who can tell but that the Lord may permit him at &s;ometimes &s;o to do, for a ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment to &s;uch unbridled tongues? I remem|ber, that above fourty years ago, when there was a great di&s;cour&s;e about Witches; <HI>A very holy man heard his Wife &s;ay, &s;he de&s;ired a &s;ucking Pig; and be going to a Neighbours hou&s;e, &s;aw a Sow with a litter of Pigs, and took a phanta&s;ie to one of them in particular for his Wife, and asked the Owner for that Pig; the Owner denied him: Hereupon he went away in a great pa&s;&s;ion, very un&s;uitable to &s;uch a per&s;on. And that very Pig left its dam and Company, and followed this man to his home.</HI> This was ob&s;erved in the day of it, it was &s;uppo&s;ed Satan might have &s;ome hand in it, taking advantage upon the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;o good a man, to render him &s;u&s;pected by &s;uch an accident if he could.</P>

If the party &s;u&s;pected be found to have the Devils mark: for it is com|monly thought, when the Devil maketh his Covenant with them, he always leaveth his mark behind him. <HI>Bernard</HI> makes it a ground of Conviction.

<P N="3">3 If we enquire how the&s;e are known to be the marks of one in league with Satan? It mu&s;t come from the Confe&s;&s;ion of Witches, that have owned &s;uch things.</P>
<P>Now among the many Confe&s;&s;ors at <HI>Salem,</HI> there were &s;undry declared they had &s;uch marks on them: one in her head which &s;he &s;aid the Devil in likene&s;s of a bird came daily, and pecked, or &s;ucked.

Another &s;aid, &s;he had the Devils mark upon her leg, which was a blew &s;pot as broad as a Shilling: her Husband te&s;tifyed, that he &s;aw the &s;pot, but little &s;u&s;pected it to be the De|vils

mark. Others had &s;ores on other parts of their bodies, which they &s;aid the Devil &s;ucked; but by all that, I could learn by tho&s;e that &s;aw them, there was nothing to demon&s;trate that they came in a preternatural way by Satan; but only the parties own affirmation: which whether true or fal&s;e I leave to God and time farther to di&s;cover. And I &s;uppo&s;e we had as many confe&s;&s;ions and demon&s;trations to render what they &s;aid credible, as hath been known at any one time in &s;ome Ages. But be it &s;o, that by the confe&s;&s;ions of known Witches there have been upon &s;ome of the ba&s;er &s;ort (as <HI>Ber|nard</HI> &s;aith) of them, &s;uch teats, or marks. The&s;e may come by natural cau&s;es, or violent ca&s;ualties, and by Satan be perverted to &s;uch an u&s;e. But if they come from Satan immediate|ly as the confe&s;&s;ors acknowledge. This can only tend to the conviction of tho&s;e that &s;o confe&s;s, and where tho&s;e marks are found: but make nothing to the proof, or &s;u&s;picion of other per&s;ons to be guilty of that crime, who having &s;uch marks deny the crime, and a&s;cribe the&s;e bodily marks to other cau&s;es. So that its far more &s;afe wholly to lay a&s;ide the practice of &s;earching after &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons teats or Witch marks, unle&s;s in tho&s;e who confe&s;s them|&s;elves to have them, and that for tryal to &s;ee whether they &s;ay true or not; then by u&s;ing it to lay &s;tre&s;s upon a fallible &s;ign.</P>

Satan by his wiles in this kind hath gained too much credit, in hours of Temptation.

<P>But before we give credence to &s;uch a di&s;co|very, we mu&s;t be very circum&s;pect lea&s;t we be deceived by humane knavery; as happened in a ca&s;e nigh <HI>Richmond</HI> I&s;land, <HI>circiter Anno</HI> 1659.</P>
<P><HI>One Mr.</HI> Thorpe <HI>a drunken Preacher, was got|ten in to Preach at</HI> Black point <HI>under the appear|ance and profe&s;&s;ion of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and boarded at the hou&s;e of Goodman</HI> Bayly, <HI>and</HI> Bay|lyes <HI>Wife ob&s;erved his Conver&s;ation to be contrary to his calling, gravely told him his way was contrary to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and de&s;ired him to reform his Life or leave her hou&s;e. So he departed from the hou&s;e, and turned her Enemy, and found an op|portunity to do her an injury: and it &s;o fell out that Mr.</HI> Jordan <HI>of</HI> Spurwink <HI>had a Cow dyed, and a|bout that time Goody</HI> Bayly <HI>had &s;aid, &s;he intended &s;uch a day to travel to</HI> Ca&s;co-Bay. <HI>Mr.</HI> Thorpe <HI>goes to Mr</HI> Jordans <HI>man or men and &s;aith, the Cow was bewitched to death, and if they would lay the carca&s;s in a place he &s;hould appoint, he would burn it, and bring the Witch: and accordingly the Cow is laid by the path that led from</HI> Black point <HI>to</HI> Ca&s;|co, <HI>and &s;et on fire that day Goody</HI> Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly <HI>was to travel that way, and &s;o &s;he came by while the Car|ca&s;s was in burning, and</HI> Thorpe <HI>had her que&s;tioned

for a Witch: But Mr.</HI> Jordan <HI>interpo&s;ed in her behalf: and &s;aid his Cow dyed by his Servants negligence, and to cover their own fault they were willing to have it imputed to Witchcraft; and Mr.</HI> Thorpe <HI>knew of</HI> Goody Baylyes <HI>intended Journey, and orders my Servants (&s;aid he) with|out my approbation, to burn my Cow in the way where</HI> Bayly <HI>is to come; and &s;o unriddled the kna|very, and delivered the innocent.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e where there is no &s;uch deceit, and the &s;u&s;pected party comes to it, when &s;uch a thing is burned, or &s;eems extraor|dinarily hurt or concerned at &s;uch a time, how will this prove the party guilty of the crime, he or &s;he is &s;u&s;pected of? If any way, it mu&s;t (1.) Proceed from &s;ome natural cau&s;e, or &s;ym|pathy in nature, between the thing burned, and the Witches Body; but no rea&s;on can be given of this; for a charm is wrought by the Devils power, and not by any natural power of the Sorcerer, conveying any natural venome from their own body, which by the operation of the fire &s;hould revert back into it again, as to its center or fountain. (2) Or from the immediate hand of God, cau&s;ing this effect for di&s;covery of the Guilty; which we have no warrant from the Word of God to expect (as was &s;aid in another ca&s;e, <HI>Chapt.</HI> 8.) (3) Or by means of the per&s;on burning the thing, &amp; u&s;ing it as a charm to find out the per&s;on that laid the inchantment upon the thing burnt;
<PB N="80" REF="001050_0080_0FAEF48F8EFCC2F0">
which if it be affirmed truly, would rather prove the burner the Sorcerer; and &s;o tend to clear the &s;u&s;pected. (4.) Or it proceeds from the Compact made between the Devil and the Sorcerer; which if any affirm, I ask how know you there is any &s;uch Covenant made? that is fir&s;t to be proved, and then that this is one article in that Covenant, and that the Devil will attend to, and keep his part of the Covenant inviolable. Neither of which can be demon&s;trated. (5.) Or this &s;uffering is a meer phanta&s;ie, or the free agency of the Devil, who is a lyar from the beginning, and therefore not to be he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded.

<P>Among the Confe&s;&s;ors, <HI>Anno</HI> 1692. was a Negro Woman, who charged two women to make her a Witch, de&s;cribing how &s;he &s;ee her mark in the Devils Book. And &s;aid, if &s;he might be permitted, &s;he would fetch the things whereby &s;he tormented the afflicted complain|ers. And accordingly brought an Handker|chief, wherein &s;everal knots were tyed, raggs of Cloth, a piece of Chee&s;e and a piece of gra&s;s. And as I was credibly informed, &s;ome compel|led her to &s;wall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w the gra&s;s, &amp; that night &s;he was burned in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er fle&s;h; and one took a piece of her ragg and burnt it in the fire, and one of

the Afflicted that had complained of her, was pre&s;ently burned on the hand. Another piece of her rags was put under water, and then o|thers complainants were choaked, and &s;trived for breath as if under water: And another ran to the River as if &s;he would drown her &s;elf. Here note, that the raggs on which, as the Confe&s;&s;or &s;aid, the Witchcraft was laid, did when put into fire and water, affect the per|&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be thereby bewitched more than the Charmer her &s;elf. And probably the cau&s;e may be, that Satan, the Lord permitting him, may inflict his mi&s;chief on the per&s;on, the Spectators or Actors herein &s;uppo&s;e to be con|cerned, &s;uiting hereby his de&s;ign to mans faith about it. And if &s;o, the rea&s;on why any &s;u&s;|pected per&s;on is hereby concerned is not be|cau&s;e they are guilty, but becau&s;e they are &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P N="15">15. If the above named Signs &s;ingly taken, are not &s;ufficient to prove a per&s;on guilty of this Crime; then when many, or mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions above named center upon the &s;ame per&s;on, they cannot prove them guilty.

<P>But probably it may be &s;aid, that the methods which I except again&s;t have been u&s;ed with good &s;ucce&s;s, for by &s;uch things Witchcrafts &amp; Witches have been di&s;covered, &amp; &s;ome brought to confe&s;&s;ion and repentance, and given unde|niable demon&s;trations of the reality of their guilt, and recovery after it out of that &s;nare of the Devil and therefore &s;uch ways of di&s;covery are &s;till to be u&s;ed.</P>

<P N="2">2. If the di&s;covery above&s;aid hath followed upon the u&s;e and dependance upon the means above&s;aid, it may be &s;aid to come from Satan (over-ruled by the Lord to &s;ub&s;erve his glorious purpo&s;es) as the in&s;trument of di&s;covery, who expo&s;eth at &s;ome times his own Va&s;&s;als to hu|mane ju&s;tice, that he may cut them off from the earth: and therefore a&s;&s;umes their &s;hapes or otherwi&s;e renders them &s;u&s;pected to their Neighbours upon &s;uch kind of pre&s;umptions, as may wrap in the guilty and innocent toge|ther, and thereby working upon the erroneous principles of men, doth (as we u&s;e to &s;ay, kill two birds with one &s;tone,) deliver up his own Servant to ruine, and give occa&s;ion for the condemnation thereby of an innocent per&s;on.

<P N="16">16. <HI>BErnard</HI> &s;aith, Witches may be convicted by their <HI>Exta&s;ies</HI>: with the delight whereof, Witches are &s;o taken, that they will hardly conceal the &s;ame: or however at &s;ome time or other they may be found in them. But the in&s;ufficiency of this kind of proof will appear by con&s;idering the various &s;orts of <HI>Exta|&s;ies,</HI> and the diver&s;e &s;ubjects of them. <HI>Exta&s;ies</HI> are either natural, divine or diabolical.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Natural,</HI> which proceeds from the con&s;ti|tution of the body, and &s;ome violent di&s;ea&s;e, as <HI>Feaver, &amp;c.</HI> whereby the imagination is &s;trang|ly tran&s;ported, and the party conceiveth him|&s;elf to be in &s;ome glorious place &amp; company <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which proves but a meer dream of a man eating and drinking, but when he awaketh his &s;oul is empty. <HI>I&s;a</HI> 29 8.</P>

Tells us of a Woman con|fe&s;&s;ing her &s;elf a Witch, who pretended &s;he had been turned into a Wolf &amp; killed a Sheep &amp; Cow in that &s;hape, and the Cow &amp; Sheep were killed at that time. And of a man Wolf that was &s;u&s;|pected

in that &s;hape, to devour Cattle, and his face had &s;everal &s;cratches and hurts, which they &s;aid were given him by the Dogs that took him for a Wolf, and he confe&s;t him&s;elf, that twice a year he was changed from a man to a Wolf. But this change could not be real, but an abu&s;e of Phanta&s;ie, either from a di&s;tracting Melan|choly called <HI>Lycanthropia,</HI> whereby he imagined he was transformed into a Wolf. Or el&s;e, if he were indeed a Wizzard, the Devil ca&s;t him into a profound trance, whereby he imagined he was killing Cattle as a Wolf; while the mi&s;|chief done was other wi&s;e, and probably by a real Wolf.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e that have been ob&s;e&s;&s;ed have had &s;trange <HI>Exta&s;ies</HI>; as &s;ome of our afflicted per|&s;ons have had their trance fits; in which they lay long time in a Swound, and when they came out of them declared they had been car|ried to delectable places, and had &s;een glorious &s;ights of Men and Angels; as is in part declared above, <HI>Chapt.</HI> 5. So that its ea&s;ier to find a per|&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or di&s;tracted by &s;uch <HI>Exta&s;ies,</HI> than to prove a per&s;on hereby in voluntary league with the Devil.</P>
<P N="17">17. I come next to con&s;ider the te&s;timony of &s;uch as confe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be Witches, do witne&s;s again&s;t others as partners with them in the &s;ame crime. This hath been accounted &s;ufficient proof by the <HI>Common Law.</HI> See <HI>Keeble.

Ibidem.</HI> And <HI>Glanvil. Ibidem, p.</HI> 141. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The ground of it is from the received <HI>Maxim,</HI> That <HI>Socii criminis,</HI> partners in a crime confe&s;&s;ing their own guilt, and di&s;covering their compani|ons, are fit and &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e their companions. As is frequently proved in ca&s;es of Murder, Trea&s;on, Robbery, Theft <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and why not as well in Witchcraft? <HI>Perkins</HI> makes this only a pre&s;umption. But <HI>Bernard</HI> makes it a convictive evidence, when one or more fellow-Witches, confe&s;&s;ing their own Witchcraft, and bearing witne&s;s again&s;t others; if they can make good the truth of their wit|ne&s;s, and give &s;ufficient proof of it: As that they have &s;een them with their Spirits; &mdash; or that they have been together in their meetings, and &s;uch like. Now in the Examinations and tryals at <HI>Salem,</HI> there was great plenty of this kind of Te&s;timony; for about Fifty confe&s;&s;ing, they mo&s;t of them if not all accu&s;ed others as partners with them at their Witch meetings; as at a great Pond nigh <HI>Andover,</HI> &s;ome of them &s;aid, they met together, and &s;ome at <HI>Newbury|falls,</HI> and were Baptized there by <HI>Satan.</HI> And &s;ome at <HI>Salem</HI> Village as above &s;hewed, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. &amp; 3.

There were many &s;uch in&s;tances which &s;eemed exceeding demon&s;trative in that day. Yet upon an after review of the whole the&s;e confe&s;&s;ors te&s;timony appeareth to be very doubtful, if not utterly fal&s;e. Yet I would not deny all evidence of confe&s;&s;ors to be rejected: for the ca&s;e may be &s;o that per&s;ons may give &s;uch infallible &s;igns of their own guilt of this, (as well as other crimes) and &s;uch tokens of real repentance for the &s;ame, as may render their te&s;timony notwith&s;tanding their former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion as credible, as the te&s;timony of any other confe&s;&s;ing Malefactor.

<P>Here we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>Penitent Confe&s;&s;ors,</HI> and <HI>Impenitent Magicians.</HI></P>
<P>If a <HI>Magician</HI> or white Witch (as they are
<PB N="88" REF="001050_0088_0FAEF497A44C4C20">
called) come in to di&s;cover and te&s;tify again&s;t another to be a Witch; <HI>This</HI> (<HI>as</HI> Perkins <HI>&s;aith,</HI> Chap. 7. <HI>p.</HI> 209.) <HI>is no more then the Devils te&s;ti|mony, becau&s;e by the Devils help he revealeth the Witch.</HI> And indeed &s;uch are but the Devils tools to do his work at his beck, and &s;o will as readily accu&s;e the innocent as the guilty. But the rea&s;ons that &s;way with me to que&s;tion the truth of the confe&s;&s;ors, <HI>Anno</HI> 1692. notwith|&s;tanding their &s;eeming repentance for &s;uch crimes, are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. The&s;e confe&s;&s;ors by their plau&s;ible con|fe&s;&s;ions and accu&s;ations of others begetting cre|dit, have been a great if not the greate&s;t Engine of Satan to carry on the accu&s;ing and appre|hending of others, until this matter came to &s;uch an height, that if it had not been &s;topped might have brought the be&s;t Chri&s;tians in the Coun|try, under the imputation of that abomination, and have involved all in confu&s;ion or blood. The kingdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Satan being &s;o evident in the winding up of that whole contrivance, leads us to &s;ee his finger in this principal means, for the managment of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some of the&s;e confe&s;&s;ors were fir&s;t under diabolical vexations, (as the other afflicted or ob&s;e&s;&s;ed per&s;ons were) and under tho&s;e tor|ments did, as they &s;ay, &s;ign to a Book pre&s;ent|ed to them, real or imaginary, by which they obtained ea&s;e of their pains: And then Satan in their &s;hapes afflicted others who accu&s;ed them
<PB N="89" REF="001050_0089_0FAEF4998324A060">
until they confe&s;&s;ed. And after &s;uch confe&s;&s;i|ons again&s;t them&s;elves, they al&s;o accu&s;ed others, as being with them, and they were afflicted them&s;elves, as they had been at the fir&s;t and complained again&s;t their Neighbours as others did. So that the&s;e per&s;ons may ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed <HI>Daimonizomenoi,</HI> under &s;ome kind of ob&s;e&s;&s;ion and delu&s;ion of Satan all this time, and &s;o their Phanta&s;ies and Sences abu&s;ed by him all the while; Satan &s;ometimes tearing of them as a devouring Lyon, and at other times beguiling of them, as a Subtil Serpent.</P>
<P N="3">3. Others that were not &s;o afflicted before their Confe&s;&s;ing, were &s;o pre&s;ently after it, and &s;o may be reckoned in the &s;ame predica|ment with the others.</P>
<P N="4">4. I am jealous, and I hope with a godly jealou&s;ie, that &s;ome by the&s;e their accu&s;ations of others, hoped to gain time, and get favour from the Rulers. And that &s;ome of the inferiour &s;ort of people did ill Offices, by promi&s;ing them favour thereby more than they had ground to engage. And that &s;ome under the&s;e temptations regarded not as they &s;hould what became of others, &s;o that they could thereby &s;erve their own turns. And I have been credibly informed, that &s;ome have &s;ince acknowledged &s;o much.</P>
<P N="5">5. The&s;e Confe&s;&s;ors &s;ince deny their Confe&s;|&s;ions, and accu&s;ing of others, or &s;ay they re|member nothing of what they &s;aid or did in

<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e that being grievou&s;ly vexed with the Devil did, and &s;aid they well under&s;tood not what them&s;elves. As above &s;aid.</P>

<P N="1">1. The verb <HI>Gna&s;hah,</HI> &s;ignifies to get, obtain, or &s;et up (as the <HI>Dutch</HI> tran&s;late it) &s;o that here is nothing in this place to make for their turn; for though he could not make a famili|ar &s;pirit, yet he could obtain, or &s;et up a fa|miliar &s;pirit.</P>

<P N="3">3. As the gifts and attainments of the Lords Prophets were differing, and &s;o their operati|ons, as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.4, 5, 6.

Becau&s;e this was one abominable way whereby the Sorcerers Sacri|ficed, to their Devil gods, to implore their help. And as the Lord did more freely &amp; familiarly reveal him&s;elf and his coun&s;el to &s;ome more than others: As to <HI>Mo&s;es, Exod</HI> 33.11. <HI>To whom the Lord &s;pake face to face, as a man &s;peaketh to his friend.</HI> So Satan had &s;ome of the&s;e his de|voted Servants, to whom he was more open &amp; familiar in conver&s;e. And &s;uch were tho&s;e that had a familiar Spirit to appear at their call: as the woman at <HI>Endor,</HI> by her familiar Spirit divining, brings up the counterfeit <HI>Samuel.</HI> And as the people did &s;eek unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &amp; &s;uch Prophets of the Lord as had more e&s;pecial ac|quaintance with the Lord.

with a cloth, and &s;aid over the wound tho&s;e words, and without other means the wound was cured in a few days. I de&s;ired to hear the words, and he related them to me; and I found him almo&s;t as ignorant in Scriptures, as an Heathen, and found he could not read. Whereupon I informed him that part of his words were Scripture, and part not; and that tho&s;e words upon which the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s was laid in order to the cure, were a perver&s;e addition to the Scriptures: a meer fiction of mans invention; and declared to him, that if any &s;uch healing followed upon &s;uch a form of words, it could not come from the efficacy of the words them&s;elves, or from a divine concurrence working a wonder, becau&s;e of tho&s;e words, which were indeed a lye in the additions made; therefore if any vertue were in them, it came by the Devil, and &s;o tho&s;e words a kind of Sorcery. The man hereby &s;eemed convinced of his error, and promi&s;ed reformation. I do not believe this man was a Wizard (though in danger of it) becau&s;e he did it ignorantly in misbelief.</P>
<P>I fear &s;ome young per&s;ons through a vain curio&s;ity to know their future condition, have tampered with the Devils tools, &s;o far that hereby one door was opened to Satan to play tho&s;e pranks; <HI>Anno</HI> 1692. I knew one of the Afflicted per&s;ons, who (as I was credibly in|formed) did try with an egg and a gla&s;s to

find her future Husbands Calling; till there came up a Coffin, that is, a Spectre in likene&s;s of a Coffin. And &s;he was afterward followed with diabolical mole&s;tation to her death; and &s;o dyed a &s;ingle per&s;on. A ju&s;t warning to o|thers, to take heed of handling the Devils wea|pons, le&s;t they get a wound thereby.</P>
<P>Another, I was called to pray with, being un|der &s;ore fits and vexations of Satan. And upon examination I found &s;he had tryed the &s;ame charm: and after her confe&s;&s;ion of it and ma|nife&s;tation of repentance for it, and our prayers to God for her, &s;he was &s;peedily relea&s;ed from tho&s;e bonds of Satan.

Becau&s;e &s;uch per&s;ons act ignorantly, not con&s;idering they hereby go to the Devil; yet borders very much upon it: and is too like <HI>Sauls</HI> going to the Witch at <HI>Endor,</HI> and <HI>Ahaziah</HI> &s;ending to the God of <HI>Ekron</HI> to enquire.</P>

<P>I proceed now to &s;peak of &s;ome kinds of the&s;e Devili&s;h arti&s;ts, not by an exact di&s;tri|bution of them into their &s;everal &s;pecies. For though they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;everal names and practices, yet they all agree in the general crime of Witchcraft, and being thereby as it were the Devils Prie&s;ts and Prophets, depend|ing upon his aid and oracles; &s;o that he that is

of one kind may be al&s;o of another, or all the re&s;t, according to their &s;everal ends for which, and ways by which they make their applicati|ons to the Prince of darkne&s;s: and as he is plea&s;ed to communicate of his skill or power to the an&s;wering of their expectations for a re|ward of their dependance upon him. And as of old, they had &s;everal names, as Magicians, Di|viners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So of late times, they have their &s;e|veral names, and in part &s;everal kinds of skill, or power, as Conjurers, A&s;trologers, Cunning men, Mathematicians, Witches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But all of them if they have their knowledge, or skill, or work|ing by the Devil, are in Satans black li&s;t of Witches. Some &s;uch there have been who di|vine by repre&s;enting a per&s;on, or coffin, or thing &s;ought after in a looking gla&s;s, to di&s;cover to the per&s;on enquiring &s;omewhat &s;ecret, or future. I have heard &s;everal credible Stories of &s;uch Conjurers; and &s;hall relate one here that I &s;uppo&s;e was never in Print. An ancient Woman related to me, <HI>That when &s;he was a Maid, &s;he had a curio&s;ity to know who &s;hould be her Husband, and was informed of a Doctor that would &s;hew Maids their future Husbands in a gla&s;s: To him therefore &s;he went with her Money in her hand, to know who &s;hould be her Husband; and be carry|ed her to a great looking gla&s;s, where &s;he &s;aw a man in his full proportion whom &s;he never &s;aw before. And a while after met this man (repre&s;ented in the gla&s;s) in the street, and having on the &s;ame
<PB N="135" REF="001050_0135_0FAEF3D78572DA08">
Cloaths he was repre&s;ented with from head to foot; and &s;oon after he came a Suitor to her, and &s;he was Married to him, and was her Husband when &s;he made this Relation.</HI> In this relation ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. It was no doubt a truth, for &s;he told me this in way of craving my advice, whether &s;he had done well or evil in going to the Dr. and I told her, &s;he did evil in going thereby to the Devil. 2. It was no delu&s;ion of her phanta&s;ie, or affection working toward any per&s;on; for it was one &s;he never &s;aw before, that was now &s;hewed unto her. 3. The Dr. could not bring into the gla&s;s the &s;hadow of a man ab&s;ent and unknown, by any natural cau&s;e, or means by him u&s;ed. Therefore it was from the Devil, who rai&s;ed this Spectre in likene&s;s of a man then un|known. 4. And the Dr. doing this frequently for his Money, mu&s;t know he did it by a fami|liar Spirit, and therefore was a Conjurer in &s;ome league explicite, or implicite with Satan. And I have heard and read of other Stories of this kind very credible, which &s;atisfy me, that this was not the only Conjurer in <HI>England.</HI> But it may be queried,</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How could Satan foretel this woman who &s;hould be her Husband, it being then a future con|tingent thing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In this ca&s;e, it might be ea&s;y for Satan to give a very probable conjecture; for the man was a <HI>Newfoundlander</HI> that came to <HI>England</HI> for a Wife, as directed by his friends unto this

And by this repre&s;entation in the gla&s;s impo&s;eth upon her Super&s;titious, igno|rance, a kind of belief of a nece&s;&s;ity to accept him when he came.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Here then we may enquire, <HI>How can the Devil know things to come? Is not this Gods pre|rogative? I&s;a</HI> 41.22, 23.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Its true that the Lord alone knows things to come, &s;o that neither man or Angel can know future events, unle&s;s the Lord make them known, or afford means whereby the creature may attain to know them: <HI>Shew us things to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods.

the mo&s;t part it proves according to mans fore|&s;ight. <HI>A wi&s;e man fore-&s;eeth the evil, Prov.</HI> 22.3 <HI>&amp;</HI> 27.12.</P>
<P N="1">1. By vi&s;ions and revelations and &s;uch like, &s;o God revealed to <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> the conditions of their Po&s;terity for a great while to come, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.19.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Prophecyes, promi&s;es &amp; threatnings in Scripture are a &s;tanding revelation of futu|rities, in matters religious, civil, political &amp; na|tural, as the changes of &s;ea&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c. Gen</HI> 8.22.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many things are fore-known by their cau|&s;es. As that wood thrown into the fire will be burnt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus many Phy&s;itians fore|&s;ee the death of a per&s;on &s;ick of an incurable di&s;ea&s;e, when neither they nor their relations are &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P N="4">4 Many things are fore known by the u&s;ual &s;ignes that go before them, which though they are not proper cau&s;es of the effects following, yet are concurrent with them. <HI>As when the Fig trees branch is tender Summer is nigh, Math.</HI> 24.32.

<P N="5">5. Some things men fore&s;ee very probable to come to pa&s;s, becau&s;e them&s;elves or others have intended and contrived how to bring them to pa&s;s. As <HI>Saul</HI> fore tells to <HI>Jabe&s;h-Gilead; They &s;hall have help to morrow by that time the Sun be

<P N="1">1. In all the above mentioned ways, except the fir&s;t, Satan hath the &s;ame advantage to know future events as man hath; and many advantages above man. (1.) As he is more knowing, wi&s;e, and of a larger under&s;tanding than man. (2.) In that as a Spirit, he pierces more into the in&s;ides and &s;ecrets of per&s;ons, actions and things. He cannot know the heart of man immediately, that is Gods pre|rogative, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.10. Yet &s;o far as the heart di&s;covers it &s;elf by its operations, upon the &s;en|&s;es, external and internal, and other members of the body, Satan will find it out. (3.) By the &s;wiftne&s;s and multitude of tho&s;e Legions of unclean Spirits; they are pre&s;ent in all Companies, Coun&s;ils, Cabals, and affairs of the Children of men, even with the Sons of God when they wor&s;hip God; and with the

Sons of men in all the compa&s;s of the earth. <HI>Job</HI> 1.6, 7. (4) They have their experien|ces of five thou&s;and years &s;tanding. (5.) When they intend and contrive any de&s;ign upon the children of men, they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not in danger of be|ing prevented by death (as men often are) for Spirits cannot dye; and &s;o more probably foretel the events of their own coun&s;els. And by all the means and advantages above-&s;aid, Satan can fore-&s;ee future contingent events much farther off than man can, and &s;o foretell (the Lord &s;uffering) a &s;ign or wonder which &s;hall after come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Satan hath al&s;o the advantage of fore|knowing, and fore &s;hewing future things by &s;ome way of divine revelation at &s;ome times, for the puni&s;hment of men. So God by &s;ome means (the way whereby to us unknown) lets the Devil know the death of <HI>Saul</HI> and his Sons, and reveal it to <HI>Saul</HI> for his puni&s;hment in going to &s;eek to Satan; and &s;o Satan knows the way to de&s;troy <HI>Ahab,</HI> and that from God; and contrives a way to bring it about, <HI>viz.</HI> by being <HI>a lying Spirit in the mouth of</HI> Ahabs <HI>Pro|phets.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Yea, the Lord &s;ucceeds the diabolical divinations of the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> to prophe|cy &s;ucce&s;s unto him again&s;t <HI>Judah,</HI> for the pu|ni&s;hment of <HI>Judahs</HI> fins. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 21.18. <HI>to</HI> 25.

<HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> knew not which to go fir&s;t unto. (2.) Therefore he u&s;eth divination by arrows, by con&s;ulting an Image or <HI>Teraphim,</HI> and by looking into the liver of &s;ome bea&s;ts (always u&s;ed by the heathen) &s;o that if the divination favour the right hand, he will go fir&s;t to <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI>: If the left, to <HI>Rabbah.</HI> (3.) Tho&s;e divinations had no natural power in them to direct them, but they were means whereby they enquire of their Gods, that is the Devil. (4) The Lord &s;o over rules the divination, that is the Devils Oracle by the Image, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that the an&s;wer &s;hall be, <HI>Go to Jeru&s;alem and pro&s;per</HI>; and accordingly he goes and pro&s;pers. (5.) The Lord grants &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s (not ap|pointing the &s;in) unto the&s;e devilli&s;h divinati|ons for the puni&s;hment of his apo&s;tate people. But when ever the Lord plea&s;eth, he di&s;ap|points all the Devils. Ordinances.

<P N="4">4. If all the ways above &s;aid &s;o fail the De|vil, that he cannot foretel what &s;hall be hereaf|ter, he hath an art by the ambiguity of his an|&s;wers, to &s;alve his credit, be the event which way it will. So 1 <HI>King.</HI> 22.6. He tells <HI>Ahab;

<P N="2">2. Another &s;ort of Diviners are they that reveal &s;ecrets, as where Stollen Goods are hid, or how Per&s;ons and Ve&s;&s;els do at Sea, or in other Countries, which they pretend to know by the Stars, and Po&s;itions of the Heavens; but indeed by a familiar &s;pirit.

Before the Hea|then <HI>Romans</HI> Be&s;ieged any City, their Prie&s;ts, called out the God, under who&s;e tutelage the City was, that he would for&s;ake the people, Temples and holy things, and be Provo&s;t unto them, and accept of their City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> vowing to him, if he would &s;o do, to honour him with Temples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then offered Sacrifices to the Dictator or Emperour, devoted, or cur&s;ed the Enemies Cities and Armies, that they might be filled with fear, terror, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>Here it may be enquired, <HI>Whether per&s;ons ob|&s;e&s;&s;ed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or under bodily torments or vexati|ons by Satan, are fit witne&s;&s;es</HI>?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer in the en&s;uing Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 1. Tho&s;e who&s;e Bodies are &s;orely af|flicted by the Devil, and yet their under&s;tand|ings clear and free, are fit to be Witne&s;&s;es as well as others. As was <HI>Job</HI>&punc; who when Satan had &s;mitten him with &s;ore boyls from head to foot, yet was a fit witne&s;s for God. <HI>Job</HI> 42.7. <HI>Speaking of God the thing that was right.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 2.

So the Damo&s;el, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.16, 17. Though &s;he gave a true te&s;timony concerning <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> yet &s;he was no fit witne&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he &s;pake by the in&s;tigation of Satan, &amp; not of her own knowledge. So it may be proportio|nably in per&s;ons under the influence of in|chantment, or ob&s;e&s;&s;ion by Satan, although in a le&s;&s;er degree.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 3. Hence it may follow, that a per&s;on under the&s;e a&s;&s;aults of hell, may be fit for a witne&s;s at one time, when free from the&s;e fits, which darken his under&s;tanding: But not ano|ther

time, <HI>viz.</HI> when the &s;ences are beclouded by the violence of their fits. Again, they may be fit to te&s;tifie to &s;ome things; namely to what they feel and &s;uffer upon their own Bodies.

<P>Obj <HI>But is it not then according to the principles laid down above, impo&s;&s;ible to prove any per&s;on to be a Witch; &s;eeing the workings between Satan and them are &s;o &s;ecret? How can they be di&s;covered?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Other Malefactors work &s;ecretly &amp; in the dark, hoping never to be di&s;covered. <HI>Job</HI> 24 14, 15, 16, 17. The Murderer, Thief, Adulterer, &s;ay, no eye &s;hall &s;ee me, &amp; di&s;gui&s;e their faces, dig in the dark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Lord &s;earcheth out &s;uch Malefactors, when &s;ettled on their lees, with his candle of judgment, though they dig deep to hide them&s;elves from men; yea, &amp; if it were po&s;&s;ible, from God him&s;elf. They &s;ay, <HI>Who &s;eeth us? who knoweth us, Zeph.</HI> 1.12. <HI>I&s;a</HI> 29.15, 16. Yet the Lord brings all to light before men when he plea&s;eth.

<P>I Shall conclude this Di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome Application of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may hence &s;ee ground to fear, that there hath been a great deal of innocent blood &s;hed in the Chri&s;tian World, by proceeding up|on un&s;afe principles, in condemning per&s;ons for Male&s;ick Witchcraft.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there have been great &s;inful neglects in &s;paring others, who by their divinings about things future, or di&s;covering things &s;ecret, as &s;tollen Goods, <HI>&amp;c</HI> or by their informing of per&s;ons and things ab&s;ent at a great di&s;tance, have implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a familiar &s;pirit, yet coloured over with &s;pecious pretences, and have drawn people to enquire of them: A &s;in frequently forbidden in Scripture, as <HI>Lev.</HI> 19 31 <HI>&amp;</HI> 20.6. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 8.19, 20. and yet let alone, and in many parts of the World, have been counte|nanced in their diabolical skill and profe&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e they &s;erve the intere&s;t of tho&s;e that have a vain curio&s;ity, to pry into things God hath forbidden, and concealed from di&s;covery by lawful means.

and the like; to beget admiration, and plea&s;e Spectators, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When as the&s;e divinations and operations are the Witchcraft more condemn|ed in Scripture than the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. But to come nigher home, we have cau&s;e to be humbled for the mi&s;takes &amp; errors which have been in the&s;e Colonies, in their Proceed|ings again&s;t per&s;ons for this crime, above four|ty years ago and downwards, upon in&s;ufficient pre&s;umptions and pre&s;idents of our Nation, whence they came.

<P N="4"><PB N="167" REF="001050_0167_0FAEF3F808E7B960">4. But I would come yet nearer to our own times, and bewail the errors and mi&s;takes that have been in the year 1692. In the apprehen|ding too many we may believe were innocent, and executing of &s;ome, I fear, not to have been condemned; by following &s;uch traditions of our fathers, maxime of the Common Law, &amp;, Pre&s;idents and Principles, which now we may &s;ee weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary, are found too light.

But &s;uch was the darkne&s;s of that day, the tortures and lamentations of the afflicted, and the power of former pre&s;idents, that we walked in the clouds, and could not &s;ee our way.

that hand, which cannot be retrieved.

When the <HI>Egyptians</HI> refu&s;ed to let <HI>I&s;rael</HI> go to &s;acrifice and keep a fea&s;t to the Lord in the Wilderne&s;s: <HI>The Lord ca&s;t upon the fiercene&s;s of his wrath, by &s;ending Evil Angels among them, P&s;al.</HI> 78.49.

<PB N="171" REF="001050_0171_0FAEF3FB905DA6C8">
to ob&s;erve them. Both the&s;e &s;ins have too much increa&s;ed in our Land. (1.) Coveteou&s;ne&s;s, an inordinate love of the World gave Satan advan|tage upon us. (2.) Contempt of Gods Wor|&s;hip and In&s;tituted Ordinances. The Errand of our Fathers into this Wilderne&s;s, was to Sa|crifice to the Lord; that is, to wor&s;hip God in purity of heart and life, and to wait upon the Lord, walking in the faith and order of the Go&s;pel in Church fellow&s;hip; that they might enjoy Chri&s;t in all his Ordinances. But the&s;e things have been greatly neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed by many born, or bred up in the Land. We have much forgotten what our Fa|thers came into the Wilderne&s;s to &s;ee. The &s;ealing Ordinances of the Covenant of Grace in Church-Communion have been much &s;light|ed and neglected; and the fury of this Storm rai&s;ed by Satan hath fallen very heavily upon many that lived under the&s;e neglects. The Lord &s;ends Evil Angels to awaken and puni&s;h our negligence: And to my knowledge &s;ome have been hereby excited to enter into the Chamber of Gods Ordinances, to hide them|&s;elves, until the indignation be over pa&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>David</HI> when he removed the Ark from <HI>Kirjathjearim,</HI> had the Ark put into a new Cart, which &s;hould have been carried by the <HI>Koha|thites. Numb.</HI> 3 31.

to the will of God; and confe&s;&s;eth that the Lord made a breach upon them, becau&s;e they &s;ought him not after the due order, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 13.5, 7, 9, 10. <HI>&amp;</HI> 15.11, 12, 13. Had not the Lord made that breach upon them, they had per&s;i&s;t|ed &s;ecurely in their error. So I may &s;ay in this ca&s;e. In the pro&s;ecution of Witchcraft, we &s;ought not the Lord after the due order; but have proceeded after the methods u&s;ed in for|mer times and other places, until the Lord in this tremendous way made a breach upon us. And hereby we are made &s;en&s;ible that the me|thods formerly u&s;ed are not &s;ufficient to prove the guilt of &s;uch a crime. And this I conceive was one end of the Lords letting Satan loo&s;e to torment and accu&s;e &s;o many; that hereby we may &s;earch out the truth more exactly. For had it not been for this dreadful di&s;pen&s;ation, many would have lived and dyed in that er|ror, which they are now convinced of.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Lord delivered into the hand of Sa|tan, the E&s;tate, Children, and Body of <HI>Job,</HI> for the tryal of <HI>Jobs</HI> faith and patience, and proof of his perfection and uprightne&s;s. So the Lord hath delivered into Satans hand mens Children and Bodies, yea names and e&s;tates into Satans hand for the tryal of their faith and patience, and farther manife&s;tation of the &s;incerity of their profe&s;&s;ions.</P>

I would infer, that Satan may be &s;uffered &s;o to darken the minds of &s;ome pious Souls, as to cau&s;e them to de&s;troy them|&s;elves by drowning, hanging, or the like. And when he hath &s;o far prevailed upon &s;ome, that formerly lived a Chri&s;tian life, but were under the prevalency of a di&s;tracting Melancholy at their latter end: We may have Charity that their Souls are Saved, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ad conclu&s;ion of their lives. I &s;peak not to excu&s;e any that having the free u&s;e of their rea&s;on willingly de&s;troy them&s;elves, out of pride, di&s;|content, impatience, <HI>&amp;c. Achitophel</HI> who out of heigth of Spirit becau&s;e his Coun&s;el was not followed, and to prevent <HI>Davids</HI> executing of him, for his rebellion and trea&s;on, de&s;troyed him&s;elf, hath left his name to &s;tink unto all ge|nerations.

But tho&s;e that being out of their right minds, and hurried by an evil Spirit, as per&s;ons under a force to be their own executioners, are not al|ways to be ranked with the&s;e.</P>
