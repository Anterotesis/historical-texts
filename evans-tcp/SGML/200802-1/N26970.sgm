<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various &s;elections of Le&s;|&s;ons in Reading and Speaking, which have fallen in|to the hands of the Compiler of the following &s;heets, &s;he does not recollect any one adapted to the u&s;e of &s;chools for Young Ladies. Feeling too &s;en&s;ibly the many inconveniencies re&s;ulting from the partial atten|tion that has heretofore been paid to their education, warmly intere&s;ted in the happine&s;s of the female part of the ri&s;ing generation, and wi&s;hing for their im|provement in virtuous principles and habits, no le&s;s than in tho&s;e per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, that are &s;uit|able to their &s;ex, &s;he has been induced to contribute &s;omething towards the promotion of &s;o de&s;ireable an end, by making the &s;election, for which &s;he now &s;o|licits the patronage of their In&s;tructors and of the public in general. Though it is principally de&s;igned for the u&s;e of &s;chools, &s;he flatters her&s;elf that it will be found not unworthy the peru&s;al of &s;uch as have already fini&s;hed their education. To render the book more de&s;erving of their attention, &s;he has generally preferred whole pieces to extracts; and has taken much pains to collect a plea&s;ing variety of matter. As it is the opinion of the mo&s;t judicious of both &s;ex|es, that public exhibitions, in &s;peaking, are not only unnece&s;&s;ary but highly improper for Mi&s;&s;es, the num|ber of Dialogues in&s;erted is &s;mall, and the&s;e are de|&s;igned only to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in learning to read this kind of compo&s;itions with propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="035911_0003_1007BED9F3785888">The Compiler having been careful, in every part of the work, to reject whatever is too common; and, finding that the faire&s;t flowers in the field of poetry have been culled out by tho&s;e who have preceded her in &s;uch collections, is apprehen&s;ive that this depart|ment will appear rather barren: &s;he hopes, however, that the pieces &s;he has &s;elected will not be thought de&s;titute of merit, or ill-adapted to her general de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Her aim throughout, has been to blend in&s;truction with rational amu&s;ement. Convinced that books, which convey only the latter, are already too much multiplied, &s;he has admitted but few pieces, which do not tend either to inform the mind, to improve the heart, to correct the manners, or to regulate the conduct.</P>
<P>If the work, in addition to the entertainment it may afford the younger part of her &s;ex, &s;hall be found to produce any of the&s;e valuable effects, the Compi|ler will reflect on the hours, which &s;he has &s;pent in collecting and arranging the materials that compo&s;e it, with great &s;atisfaction; and
<Q>"Glory in the work &s;he did not write."</Q></P>

<HEAD>READING.</HEAD>
<P>TO be able to read with propriety, is cer|tainly a genteel accompli&s;hment, and not &s;o ea&s;y to be acquired as mo&s;t people imagine; and perhaps you will not find one woman in five hundred, that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it. There are &s;o many faulty ways of reading, which young people are apt to run into, that it is difficult to avoid them all; and when once a bad habit is contracted, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to correct it.</P>
<P>There is your aunt Filmer, who reads with &s;uch a canting tone as grates the ears of the whole company. She has frequently almo&s;t &s;ung me to &s;leep, though read|ing one of the mo&s;t diverting books in the world. Your cou&s;in Pultency, you know, reads with &s;uch hurry and rapidity, and &s;uch neglect of the proper &s;tops and pau&s;es, that the mo&s;t attentive hearer cannot under&s;tand one &s;en|tence
<PB N="10" REF="035911_0006_1007BEDF981150E0">
&s;he pronounces; whil&s;t Mrs. Da&s;hwood reads in &s;uch a &s;low and &s;lovenly manner, and draws out the words to &s;uch an immoderate length, that nobody has patience to follow her. Mrs. Nugent reads with &s;uch a loud and &s;hrill voice as &s;tuns the ears of the whole audience. It might do very well in a public a&s;&s;embly, but is altogether unfit for a tea-table: whereas Mi&s;s Littleton's accent is &s;o faint and feeble, that you mu&s;t apply your ear almo&s;t to her mouth, before you can under&s;tand the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I would therefore have you form your&s;elf upon the ex|ample of your governe&s;s, who, indeed, is one of the be&s;t readers I ever heard. She reads with the &s;ame ea&s;y nat|ural voice as &s;he u&s;es in conver&s;ation. She ob&s;erves the &s;tops and pau&s;es with great exactne&s;s. She reads &s;o &s;low as to be ea&s;ily under&s;tood by any per&s;on, who will give a proper attention, and is not ab&s;olutely dull; and yet &s;o fa&s;t, as not to di&s;gu&s;t tho&s;e of the quicke&s;t apprehen&s;ion. Her voice &s;he carefully adapts to the number and extent of her audience. When &s;he reads to a large company, her voice is high without being &s;hrill; when to a &s;mall one, it is low, but withal di&s;tinct. In a word, &s;he is a complete mi&s;tre&s;s of the art of reading; and you cannot fail to become &s;o too, if you imitate her manner, and fol|low her directions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>WRITING AND SPELLING.</HEAD>
<P>WRITING, my dear, is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful arts that ever was invented. Were it not for this art, the knowledge of every per&s;on would be contracted within the narrow circle of his own experience and ob&s;er|vation; but by means of this, we can enjoy the knowl|edge and di&s;coveries of all tho&s;e, who have lived before us; and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure make them our own. By means of this art, you may conver&s;e with your friend, though removed to the mo&s;t di&s;tant corner of the world, almo&s;t as well as if per&s;onally pre&s;ent. By means of this art, you can pre&s;erve on paper whatever you read, hear,
<PB N="11" REF="035911_0006_1007BEDF981150E0">
or &s;ee, that is worth remembering; and which it would otherwi&s;e be impo&s;&s;ible to trea&s;ure up in your memory.</P>
<P>But it is not only an u&s;eful, it is likewi&s;e a polite qualifi|cation; nor &s;hould any one pretend to the character of an accompli&s;hed woman, who cannot write a di&s;tinct and legible hand. Let me therefore advi&s;e you to be remark|ably careful and diligent in learning the art of writing. Follow the directions of your ma&s;ter, who, I pre&s;ume, will lay before you the mo&s;t perfect copies and examples. Of all the various hands, a round hand is, in my opinion, the mo&s;t proper; for when you are a mi&s;tre&s;s of that, you may, with great ea&s;e, learn either a neat running or Italian hand; but if you begin with the latter, you never can arrive at any degree of perfection in the former. When you write, never be in a hurry, but proceed with the greate&s;t care and deliberation: always write as well as you can, and then your hand will be &s;till improving; for if you do not, in&s;tead of improving, it will, every day, become wor&s;e. But before you put pen to paper, you mu&s;t re&s;olve not to indulge your&s;elf in the wrong &s;pelling of a &s;ingle word; and if you faithfully ob&s;erve this rule for a &s;hort time, you will &s;oon be able to &s;pell any word without the help of a dictionary. Nothing, indeed, is more unworthy the character of a gentlewoman, than fal&s;e &s;pelling: and yet, in this re&s;pect, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, mo&s;t of our &s;ex are &s;hamefully deficient; and &s;ome of them too, whom I know to be per&s;ons of excellent good &s;en&s;e and di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities: but this mu&s;t have been owing to bad habits contracted in their youth, of which they were never afterwards able to get the better. It is therefore your part to prevent, what it is &s;o extremely difficult to correct.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CYPHERING.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the various qualifications of an ac|compli&s;hed woman, there is not any one more u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary than cyphering. Without this, you mu&s;t de|pend
<PB N="12" REF="035911_0007_1007BEE18DAB4480">
upon your memory for every farthing of money that pa&s;&s;es through your hands. Without this, you can neither keep an account of the money you receive, nor of what you expend. Without this, you will be in danger of being cheated by every per&s;on you deal with. With|out this, you will not be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the man|agement of our family, which, however, I expect you &s;hould be in a few years; and &s;till le&s;s will you be able to &s;uperintend the economy of your own, when, in the cour&s;e of providence, you come to be mi&s;tre&s;s of one. In a word, without this, you will be altogether unqualified for &s;everal of the mo&s;t important duties in life.</P>
<P>Let me therefore per&s;uade you, my dear, to give par|ticular attention to your cyphering, and to acquire &s;uch a competent knowledge in this u&s;eful art, as is proper for a woman. I &s;ay, a woman; for it is not nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould under&s;tand it &s;o perfectly as a man: as her &s;phere of action is more confined, &s;o her knowledge, in this re&s;pect, &s;hould be more confined likewi&s;e. You ought, however, I think, to be a complete mi&s;tre&s;s of the four &s;imple rules of arithmetic, the rule of proportion, and a plain method of book-keeping. And I would ad|vi&s;e you to begin to keep a di&s;tinct account of all the money you receive or lay out, and, indeed, of every thing belonging to you, that can be numbered; as &s;oon, I mean, as you have acquired a knowledge of cyphering &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. By this means, you will, at once, im|pre&s;s the rules of arithmetic more deeply in your mem|ory, and in&s;en&s;ibly acquire &s;uch a habit of accuracy and regularity, as will be of great &s;ervice to you in your fu|ture conduct.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>GRAMMAR.</HEAD>
<P>I AM glad to hear that you have, at length, entered on the &s;tudy of grammar. I hope you will go on, with &s;pirit and per&s;everance, and not be di&s;couraged by its apparent difficulty; for, however great this may
<PB N="13" REF="035911_0007_1007BEE18DAB4480">
be, the&s;e will enable you to overcome it; and in propor|tion to your trouble in the acquirement of grammatical knowledge, will be your &s;atisfaction in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Of all &s;tudies, you will probably find grammar the lea&s;t entertaining: it is, however, one of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore ought not to be neglected. Without a competent knowledge of this &s;cience you cannot expre&s;s your&s;elf with propriety, either in conver&s;ation or in writ|ing; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or want of it is one great occa|&s;ion of the difference ob&s;ervable in the language of the polite and the vulgar, the learned a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he ignorant. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this difference o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in two of your female acquaintance, Caroline M. and Sophia S. The former, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of excellent &s;en&s;e, but without any knowl|edge of grammar, expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in &s;o awkward and in|correct a manner, that, with all her under&s;tanding, &s;he is often di&s;gu&s;ting; while the latter, with not half her abil|ities, or general knowledge, by being mi&s;tre&s;s of the rules of grammar, expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf, both in writing and con|ver&s;ation, in &s;o ea&s;y, correct and graceful a manner, as charms all who hear her conver&s;e, or enjoy her corre&s;|pondence. You will, I hope, make her your model, and not think you have attained &s;ufficient knowledge in that branch of your education, till you can &s;peak and write as correctly and with as much propriety as &s;he does.</P>

<P>I HAD lately the plea&s;ure of hearing, from your governe&s;s, that you are daily improving in all the different branches of your education, and particularly in geography, which, &s;he &s;ays, you have been learning for &s;ome months pa&s;t. This is an accompli&s;hment equally u&s;eful and genteel; but in which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, mo&s;t of our &s;ex are &s;hamefully deficient; as I could prove by a variety of examples. Your aunt Delaval has frequently a&s;ked me whether Con&s;tantinople lay in A&s;ia or Africa, and a thou&s;and other que&s;tions no le&s;s ridicu|lous.

Mi&s;s Fenton, who&s;e wit is greater than her knowl|edge, and her vanity greater than both, is perpetually committing blunders of this kind. Mr. Grenville hap|pened, the other day, to be reading the news papers to a large company, and, among other articles, one from War&s;aw, giving an account of a certain nobleman, who, for &s;ome &s;light cau&s;e, had divorced his lady. He had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, than Mi&s;s, with her u&s;ual forwardne&s;s, ob&s;erved that the&s;e Spaniards were the wor&s;t hu&s;bands in the world. Some of the company blu&s;hed, others &s;miled, and the re&s;t remained demurely grave. Mi&s;s, perceiving her error, was confounded and aba&s;hed: but the gentle|man, out of his great humanity, endeavoured to apolo|gize for her, as well as he could, by adding, that the young lady's remark was very ju&s;t; that, though the place mentioned in the news-paper was the chief city in Poland, he believed there was a town &s;omewhere in Spain of the &s;ame name, and it was a very ea&s;y matter to mi&s;|take the one for the other. Into &s;uch &s;hameful blunders do young ladies frequently fall, from their ignorance of geography; and to &s;uch pitiful &s;hifts mu&s;t their friends have recour&s;e, to &s;ave them the blu&s;h of confe&s;&s;ing their ignorance. But the knowledge of geography will effec|tually prevent your committing any blunders of this kind, as it will teach you the names of all the principal towns in the world. Nor is this all; it will further acquaint you with the climate, the &s;oil and produce of all the dif|ferent parts of the earth; and with the cu&s;toms, manners, government and religion of the &s;everal inhabitants: by which means you will be able to talk pertinently on mo&s;t &s;ubjects that occur in conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>YOUR governe&s;s writes me, that you are become a great proficient both in vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic. This, though not the mo&s;t u&s;eful, is certainly one of the mo&s;t genteel qualifications which a young
<PB N="15" REF="035911_0008_1007BEE39C418540">
lady can po&s;&s;e&s;s. It is, of all others, the mo&s;t agreeable amu&s;ement, the mo&s;t plea&s;ant recreation; and &s;he that under&s;tands mu&s;ic, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed never complain that her time lies heavy on her hand. It is at once the be&s;t preventa|tive, and the mo&s;t effectual cure for melancholy and low &s;pirits, as it can bani&s;h every gloomy and de&s;ponding thought, and in&s;pire us with cheerfulne&s;s and good humour.</P>
<P>The power of mu&s;ic over the human mind is very &s;urpri&s;ing, and almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible. When we are depre&s;&s;|ed with &s;orrow and grief, it can cheer and enliven our drooping &s;pirits. When we are elated with exce&s;&s;ive and immoderate joy, (for joy may be immoderate and even dangerous) it can allay the violence of the pa&s;&s;ion, bring us down from the giddy height, and reduce us to a &s;tate of plea&s;ing tranquillity. If inflamed with anger, or boiling with rage, it can &s;often and melt us into pity and compa&s;&s;ion. In a word, hatred, malice, envy, and every other vicious pa&s;&s;ion, may, by the power of mu&s;ic, be pre&s;ently bani&s;hed, or at lea&s;t charmed and allayed for a while, and if the charm be frequently repeated, they may at la&s;t be overcome.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the many advantages which may be derived from mu&s;ic. But all this is only meant with regard to tho&s;e who have a ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, or, as it is commonly called, a good ear; for there are &s;ome people &s;o utterly devoid of this ta&s;te, that they can make no other di&s;tinction of &s;ounds, than that of more or le&s;s loud. To them, the noi&s;e of a black&s;mith's hammer, and the fine&s;t airs of a violin, are the &s;ame; whil&s;t a per&s;on of a good ear, improved by practice, receives from &s;uch an entertainment the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and refined plea&s;ure; perhaps the mo&s;t refined that can be enjoyed in this world, except that of doing a good action.</P>

<HEAD>DRAWING.</HEAD>
<P>WERE drawing only to be con&s;idered as an innocent amu&s;ement, even in this light would it merit your attention; for innocent amu&s;ements are of more
<PB N="16" REF="035911_0009_1007BEE829E8B2E0">
importance to our happine&s;s, and perhaps to our virtue too, than many people imagine. The mo&s;t active and bu&s;y &s;tations of life have &s;till &s;ome intervals of re&s;t, &s;ome hours of lei&s;ure. The body, as well as the mind, requires it. And, if the&s;e are not employed in innocent amu&s;e|ments, they will either lie heavy on our hands, and, in|&s;tead of rai&s;ing, depre&s;s our &s;pirits; or, what is wor&s;e, tempt us to kill the time, as it is called, by &s;uch amu&s;e|ments as are far from being innocent.</P>
<P>But drawing is not only an innocent amu&s;ement: it is more; it is an u&s;eful qualification. It will exerci&s;e, de|light, and improve your imagination, by filling it with the images of every thing that is beautiful or curious in the works of nature or art. It will &s;trengthen and cor|rect your judgment, by obliging you to examine the ob|jects you copy with greater care and accuracy than you would otherwi&s;e have done; and it may &s;ometimes be an a&s;&s;i&s;tance to your memory, as it will enable you to take down on paper a greater variety of objects, or cir|cum&s;tances of the &s;ame object, than it would be ea&s;y, or perhaps po&s;&s;ible, to remember. It will likewi&s;e be of great u&s;e in furni&s;hing you with beautiful patterns and de&s;igns for &s;ewing, which tho&s;e who are ignorant of this art mu&s;t borrow from others, without being able to judge whether they are good or bad.</P>
<P>But I have neither time nor inclination to enumerate all the advantages which a young lady may derive from the art of drawing. What I have &s;aid, however, will, I hope, be &s;ufficient to kindle in you a de&s;ire of acquiring an accompli&s;hment, at once &s;o u&s;eful and genteel. Allow me to give you one general advice, which is this; let the objects from which you copy, be chiefly the works of nature; and carefully avoid every thing that is unnatural, whim&s;ical, or romantic, as mo&s;t Chine&s;e drawings are. To imitate the former, has a natural tendency to improve the ta&s;te; to copy the latter, has a natural tendency to corrupt and pervert it.</P>

<HEAD>NEEDLE-WORK.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there are many other female ac|compli&s;hments more &s;howy and &s;pecious, yet there is not any one more u&s;eful than needle-work; nay, I may ven|ture to &s;ay, there is none equally &s;o. What an infinite number of the female &s;ex, and, perhaps, the mo&s;t virtu|ous part of it too, live by the needle? How greatly does it contribute to render our per&s;ons more decent, more agreeable, and more beautiful? What a &s;urprizing dif|ference is there between the appearance of Lady Morton, whom you have often &s;een at church, and Doll Common, the cinder-wench? and yet this difference is chiefly ow|ing to dre&s;s; and dre&s;s depends chiefly on the needle.</P>
<P>After all, I do not de&s;ire you to apply to your needle &s;o as to hurt your eyes, or weaken your con&s;titution: far from it. On the contrary, I would have this, and all your other &s;tudies, carried on in a perfect con&s;i&s;tency with your health, which is never to be &s;acrificed to any con&s;ideration whatever. All I mean is, that you &s;hould not neglect this qualification as u&s;ele&s;s, nor de&s;pi&s;e it as mean, or beneath a gentlewoman. U&s;ele&s;s it cannot be, for there is no &s;tation of life in which a woman can be pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, where it is not highly &s;erviceable, and for the mo&s;t part ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. And it is &s;o far from be|ing mean and unworthy the character of a lady, that I will venture to &s;ay, there never was an accompli&s;hed wo|man without a competent &s;kill in this u&s;eful art.</P>

<HEAD>CLEANLINESS.</HEAD>
<P>CLEANLINESS is a habit, I had almo&s;t &s;aid a virtue, which you cannot learn too &s;oon, nor re|tain too long, both from a regard to your&s;elf, and the world around you. It will, at once, contribute to the ea&s;e and health of your body, and be the means of intro|ducing
<PB N="18" REF="035911_0010_1007BEE9C45E02F0">
you into polite and genteel company; at lea&s;t the oppo&s;ite extreme of dirtine&s;s will certainly deprive you of that advantage; it will either make your compa|ny to be &s;hunned; or, if that cannot be done, it will al|ways render your pre&s;ence di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>But beware that you do not confound cleanline&s;s with finery; nor mi&s;take the one for the other. They are as di&s;tinct in their nature as any two things can well be; and, though not incon&s;i&s;tent, are frequently found to be &s;eparated. A woman may be very neat and clean in a plain and &s;imple dre&s;s; and &s;he may be very dirty and tawdry in a fine and co&s;tly one. There is Mi&s;s Mole&s;|worth, &s;he never wears any thing above a plain &s;ilk gown; but that, and all the other parts of her dre&s;s, which are equally &s;imple, &s;he puts on and adju&s;ts with &s;uch elegance and propriety, as plea&s;es the eye of every one that beholds her: whil&s;t Lady Dormer, on the con|trary, though dre&s;t in the riche&s;t &s;attin brocade, and loaded with a profu&s;ion of jewels and pearls, is, after all, &s;o &s;lovenly and tawdry, that &s;he may be &s;aid rather to carry her clothes like a porter, than to wear them like a well dre&s;t lady.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay, it con&s;umes a great deal of time: I am per&s;uaded you always find as much as you ought to be|&s;tow, in order to be neat, between the time that is u&s;ual for leaving off &s;chool, and that of going to dinner. Be|&s;ides, it will every day require le&s;s, for the more you practi&s;e it, the ea&s;ier it will become; and a twelvemonth hence, I dare &s;ay, you will be able to dre&s;s your&s;elf as well in half an hour, as you can do at pre&s;ent in a whole one.</P>

<HEAD>CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST of all, take care never to interrupt any per&s;on when &s;he is &s;peaking. This is the height of ill manners. If &s;he talks longer than &s;he ought, and even de&s;erves to be interrupted, yet be not you the fir&s;t to do it. That will come with a better grace from one
<PB N="19" REF="035911_0010_1007BEE9C45E02F0">
of greater age and experience. If &s;he be guilty of one fault, that is no rea&s;on why you &s;hould be guilty of another. If you have a reflection to make upon any thing &s;he has &s;aid, you mu&s;t re&s;erve it till the end of the &s;tory; though perhaps you may imagine it would have come in with greater propriety in the middle of it. If the remark would have been very pertinent then, it will not be impertinent now; but if it appears to be trifling here, you may be a&s;&s;ured it would not have been very &s;en&s;ible even there. By this means you will at once di&s;cover your prudence and di&s;cretion, and in&s;en&s;ibly ac|quire a habit of retaining and examining your thoughts before you throw them out in conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I am the more anxious to caution you again&s;t this prac|tice of interrupting people in the middle of their di&s;|cour&s;e, becau&s;e it is an error which young per&s;ons, from the natural heat of their temper, and the vivacity of their &s;pirits, are mo&s;t apt to commit. Your friend is telling a &s;tory: in con&s;equence of &s;omething &s;he &s;ays, a good thought &s;trikes your fancy; out it comes; for you can contain your&s;elf no longer: your friend is &s;topt: the re&s;t of the company &s;mile; and yet perhaps your re|mark was very &s;mart and witty. But was it really, do you think, or could it po&s;&s;ibly be, &s;o very &s;mart and wit|ty, as to apologize for your ill manners in interrupting your friend? Every &s;en&s;ible per&s;on will tell you that it could not.</P>
<P>Another rule which you ought carefully to ob&s;erve, is, never to take up too much of the conver&s;ation your|&s;elf, and far le&s;s to engro&s;s the whole of it. This, even in per&s;ons of the greate&s;t age, knowledge, and experience, mu&s;t appear ridiculous; but, in one &s;o young, &s;o igno|rant, and &s;o inexperienced as you are, it would be con|demned as the height of arrogance and pre&s;umption. Indeed, every one &s;eems to be entitled to a greater or le&s;s &s;hare of the conver&s;ation, in proportion to her years and knowledge: but no per&s;on, let her years and knowl|edge be what they will, has a right to the whole of it; nor &s;hould any one, however young and ignorant, be en|tirely excluded. This would de&s;troy the very end of conver&s;ation, which is mutually to impart and receive
<PB N="20" REF="035911_0011_1007BEEB617AADC0">
knowledge, plea&s;ure, and improvement. For, what knowledge or improvement can &s;he po&s;&s;ibly receive, who is always talking her&s;elf, and never allows the re&s;t of the company to open their mouths? Or, what plea&s;ure can they enjoy, who are condemned to profound &s;ilence, and have their ears perpetually &s;tunned with the noi&s;e of the &s;ame tongue? If, indeed, they could enjoy any plea&s;|ure in &s;uch circum&s;tances, they mu&s;t be endued with great patience and humility; greater, I am afraid, than fall to the &s;hare of any individual of the human kind.</P>
<P>In company, never &s;peak ill of any ab&s;ent per&s;on, whether friend, &s;tranger, or enemy. The fir&s;t would be ba&s;e, the &s;econd unju&s;t, and the la&s;t low and mean-&s;pirit|ed. By &s;peaking ill of your ab&s;ent friends, you de&s;erve to lo&s;e, and certainly would lo&s;e, both them and tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent; for who, in their &s;en&s;es, would culti|vate a friend&s;hip with one guilty of &s;o much perfidy and ba&s;ene&s;s? By &s;peaking ill of &s;trangers, you would make all the world your foes; for &s;he, who, without the lea&s;t provocation, can a&s;per&s;e the character of tho&s;e with whom &s;he has little acquaintance and no connexion, de|&s;erves to be the object of univer&s;al dete&s;tation. By in|veighing again&s;t your ab&s;ent enemies, you would di&s;cover the mo&s;t contemptible meanne&s;s of &s;pirit and littlene&s;s of mind; and if it &s;hould come to their ears, might flatter their pride and vanity too much, by making them ima|gine, that they had ruffled your temper more perhaps than they had really done, or, at lea&s;t, than you &s;hould give them an opportunity of knowing.</P>
<P>Another rule which you ought to ob&s;erve in conver&s;a|tion, is, never to &s;ay any thing that may give pain or unea&s;ine&s;s to any one of the company. By this I do not mean any of the errors which I have de&s;cribed and con|demned above. All the&s;e, to be &s;ure, give pain and un|ea&s;ine&s;s to the per&s;ons that &s;uffer by them; but then they do &s;o in plain and open terms, and, of con&s;equence, may be the more ea&s;ily corrected or refuted. What I mean at pre&s;ent is, that you ought never to &s;ay any thing that &s;eems to reflect, even in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, upon the faults or foibles of any of the company, or of their ab|&s;ent friends. If this proceed from malice, it betrays a bad
<PB N="21" REF="035911_0011_1007BEEB617AADC0">
heart; if from want of thought, it di&s;covers a weak head: and the ill-natured and fooli&s;h are equally unqualified for the delicate intercour&s;e of polite conver&s;ation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>DIVERSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to diver&s;ions in general, I would have you to remember, that they are to be con|&s;idered merely as diver&s;ions, and not as &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s. They are intended not to di&s;&s;ipate and un&s;ettle the mind, but only to relax and unbend it; that it may return to the performance of the important duties of life with great|er alacrity and vigour; and therefore you ought never to allow them to take up too much of your time, and far le&s;s to engro&s;s the whole of it, as is the practice, I am afraid, of too many young ladies. What with &s;hopping in the forenoon, vi&s;iting in the afternoon, and plays, balls and concerts in the evening, I doubt they find but little time for more u&s;eful employments. This might do ex|tremely well, had we been &s;ent into the world only to di|vert our&s;elves for a while with baubles and gew-gaws, like children; but that would be a &s;uppo&s;ition equally unworthy our great Creator, and the dignity of our own nature: on the contrary, we were placed here to con|tribute to the happine&s;s and welfare of our fellow-crea|tures, and to improve our minds in knowledge, virtue and piety, in order to qualify us for a better and happier &s;tate hereafter.</P>
<P>Let me therefore advi&s;e you, never to have recour&s;e to diver&s;ions, till once you are fatigued and wearied with bu&s;ine&s;s. By this means you will enjoy them with double plea&s;ure; whereas, &s;hould you make them your employment, in&s;tead of your amu&s;ement, they will lo&s;e all their reli&s;h. For it is with diver&s;ions as it is with all other &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures; the more frequently they are enjoyed, the le&s;s agreeable do they become; they pall upon the &s;en&s;e, grow ta&s;tele&s;s and in&s;ipid, and at la&s;t perfectly nau&s;eous and irk&s;ome: &s;o that, as well from a
<PB N="22" REF="035911_0012_1007BEEE84D5E270">
regard to your own happine&s;s, as from a &s;en&s;e of duty, you &s;hould take care never to throw away too much of your time upon them. And that you may not be tempt|ed to do &s;o, learn to employ your&s;elf in &s;ome more &s;eri|ous and u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s: for I believe in my con&s;cience, that it is not &s;o much from an immoderate love of plea&s;|ure, as for want of &s;omething el&s;e to do, that &s;o many young ladies &s;quander away the whole of their time in a perpetual round of diver&s;ions.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I AM glad to &s;ee by your la&s;t, that you are fully convinced of the truth of what I &s;aid concerning dre&s;s and diver&s;ions, and are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the ine&s;tima|ble worth and value of your time, which indeed is the mo&s;t precious trea&s;ure you can po&s;&s;e&s;s, as it is the foun|dation and ground-work of every other ble&s;&s;ing you enjoy.</P>
<P>But precious as our time is, yet there is not any one thing of which we are &s;o carele&s;s, or rather prodigal and profu&s;e. We either &s;quander it away upon mere trifles, or allow it to pa&s;s in a &s;tate of li&s;tle&s;s indolence, or lazy inactivity. The pre&s;ent moment we &s;eldom enjoy, or improve to any good purpo&s;e. We are perpetually bu|&s;ied in forming &s;chemes for &s;ome future and di&s;tant pe|riod; but when that period is come, we neglect it, as we have done tho&s;e that are already pa&s;t; and then lay new &s;chemes for &s;ome other period more di&s;tant &s;till: and &s;o on without end; till, at la&s;t arrived on the verge of old age, we begin to take a review of our pa&s;t con|duct, and find that we have con&s;umed the greate&s;t part of our time in forming &s;chemes and re&s;olutions; but have hardly ever had the wi&s;dom and courage to put &s;o much as one of them in execution.</P>
<P>Such is the picture of a lazy, indolent, and idle per|&s;on: for, I believe, even the lazie&s;t of that lazy tribe have &s;till &s;ome thoughts of doing better to-morrow; but
<PB N="23" REF="035911_0012_1007BEEE84D5E270">
to-morrow comes and pa&s;&s;es like to-day, and another morrow after that; and thus they doze away their whole lives in a kind of waking dream or reverie. Such a conduct us this would be extremely fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd, even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that they were certain of ar|riving at old age, though indeed it were to be wi&s;hed, for the honour of their character, that they never reach|ed that period, &s;ince the longer they live, they only be|come the more ridiculous: but when it is con&s;idered that no one can promi&s;e her&s;elf another year, and hard|ly even another day or hour, then folly is too gentle a name for &s;uch a behaviour; it is madne&s;s, it is phrenzy in the highe&s;t degree: and yet with this phrenzy and madne&s;s every per&s;on may be &s;aid to be &s;eized, who con&s;umes her whole life in idlene&s;s and indolence.</P>
<P>But do not mi&s;take me. I do not mean to in&s;inuate, by any thing I have now &s;aid, that the mind &s;hould always be kept on the &s;tretch; but this, I think, I may &s;afely affirm, that it ought always to be engaged one way or other, either in &s;ome u&s;eful and profitable em|ployment, or in &s;ome innocent and cheerful diver&s;ion, that it may return to the duties of life with greater vig|our and alacrity; but never &s;hould, by any means, be &s;uffered to ru&s;t in &s;loth and inactivity.</P>
<P>Idlene&s;s is a mo&s;t pernicious and fatal vice, whether we con&s;ider its influence on the mind or body. It weak|ens the &s;trength and impairs the beauty of the latter; for an indolent per&s;on will hardly be at the pains to take &s;o much exerci&s;e as is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the body in health and vigour. It &s;tupifies and benumbs the under|&s;tanding; for &s;he will not take the trouble to improve it either by reading or conver&s;ation. Nay, it will even corrupt and deba&s;e the heart; for it is incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of ea&s;e and indolence to have the &s;trong but fine affections of love, pity, compa&s;&s;ion, &s;orrow, &s;ympathy, and the like, frequently awakened and excited in the brea&s;t: and yet if the&s;e tender pa&s;&s;ions are not frequent|ly excited either by real or imaginary objects, the heart will gradually become hard and unfeeling, and at la&s;t perfectly callous and in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="035911_0013_1007BEF0EF8EC630">This di&s;ea&s;e of idlene&s;s has different effects upon dif|ferent tempers.

<P>On the other hand, a beautiful young lady, if &s;he is virtuous at the &s;ame time, becomes by that means, at once more virtuous and beautiful: more virtuous, be|cau&s;e her temptations to vice are more frequent and &s;trong; and every time &s;he re&s;i&s;ts the&s;e temptations, &s;he gives the mo&s;t convincing proof of her untainted cha&s;tity and un&s;potted honour: more beautiful; for what is beauty? it is not a &s;et of features formed with the nice&s;t &s;ymmetry and proportion; it is not a complexion com|po&s;ed of the pure&s;t white and red; no: but it is both the&s;e informed, in&s;pired, lighted up, and animated by the ema|nations of a virtuous mind: it is cha&s;tity, mode&s;ty,
<PB N="25" REF="035911_0013_1007BEF0EF8EC630">
good-nature, compa&s;&s;ion, benevolence, and all the other virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and tender affections &s;treaming forth from the eyes, tho&s;e windows of the &s;oul, and playing in every lineament of the face. Unle&s;s the&s;e virtues pre|vail in the &s;oul, and are &s;trongly marked and expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance, the fine&s;t features and complexion are little better than the face of a painted baby, or life|le&s;s &s;tatue: all is dull, dead, and inanimated; or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, groomy, four and &s;ullen.</P>
<P>Hence the graceful blu&s;h of mode&s;ty, and the plea&s;ing &s;mile of good-nature, &s;o frequently and &s;o awkwardly af|fected by tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of neither of the&s;e vir|tues, but perhaps are remarkable for their oppo&s;ite vices: no matter; they are paying a compliment to virtue; they confe&s;s, by their hypocri&s;y and di&s;&s;imulation, that the appearance of it is amiable and lovely; and if the appearance of it be lovely, how much more &s;o mu&s;t the reality be? The truth is, virtue is the only thing that is good and amiable: &s;en&s;e, wit, knowledge, and learning, are, in their own nature, indifferent; they are either good or bad, ju&s;t as they are well or ill employed. In the hands of a virtuous per&s;on they may be the means of much good; in the hands of a vicious per&s;on, they may be the means of much ill: but virtue, in its own nature and con&s;equences, is certainly and infallibly productive of happine&s;s, as well to the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it in par|ticular, as to the world in general.</P>

<HEAD>MODESTY.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY is the outward expre&s;&s;ion of a pure and cha&s;te mind; and, therefore, every word you &s;peak, every action you perform, every ge&s;ture of your body, every look of your eyes; in fine, every thing, by which the inward di&s;po&s;itions of the mind can be expre&s;&s;|ed and di&s;covered, comes under the regulation of this virtue.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty, as it relates to dre&s;s, has already been con&s;id|ered under that article: as it relates to conver&s;ation, it
<PB N="26" REF="035911_0014_1007BEF484016018">
has been, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, explained. After the advice I then gave you to &s;hun the lewd and immode&s;t conver|&s;ation of others, it would certainly be unnece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e any other arguments to di&s;&s;uade you from running into the &s;ame error your&s;elf. There is &s;omething in this prac|tice &s;o ba&s;e and vulgar, that I will not even &s;uppo&s;e you capable of a thing at once &s;o unpolite and immoral.</P>
<P>Nothing is more incon&s;i&s;tent with mode&s;ty, than to talk with a loud, &s;hrill and har&s;h tone of voice. This is very unbecoming, even in a man, but much more in a woman, and mo&s;t of all in a young woman, who&s;e accent &s;hould be low, &s;mooth and gentle, an emblem of the in|ward &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy of her mind. It is no le&s;s in|con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of mode&s;ty, to talk in a po&s;itive and peremptory &s;train. This is &s;carce tolerable, even when you are talking of things that cannot be contra|dicted; but it is ab&s;olutely intolerable, when you are &s;peaking of matters that are of a doubtful nature, as, in|deed, mo&s;t &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation are. It is the duty of a young lady to talk with an air of diffidence, as if &s;he propo&s;ed what &s;he &s;aid, rather with a view to receive in|formation her&s;elf, than to inform and in&s;truct the com|pany.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty, as it regards the countenance, and e&s;pecially the expre&s;&s;ion of the eyes, is no le&s;s worthy of your atten|tion, becau&s;e, perhaps, it appears more in this than in any one thing whatever. Young as you are, you cannot be ignorant, that all the different pa&s;&s;ions of the mind may be painted and expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance. An|ger and meekne&s;s, joy and &s;orrow, love and hatred, pride and humility, impudence and mode&s;ty, have each a par|ticular air of the face, naturally adapted to expre&s;s them; and whatever pa&s;&s;ion happens to be uppermo&s;t in the mind, the countenance will take its tincture and expre&s;|&s;ion from thence. Though I know the face is &s;ometimes a fal&s;e gla&s;s, &s;till I am per&s;uaded it is often a true one; and that the countenance is often a faithful picture of the mind.</P>
<P>In a word, the only way to have a mode&s;t look, a mode&s;t gait, or a mode&s;t behaviour, in general, is to have a mode&s;t mind. Without this, all the formality, gravity,
<PB N="27" REF="035911_0014_1007BEF484016018">
and grimace, in the world, will &s;ignify nothing; for, though by this means, you may be able to impo&s;e upon the thoughtle&s;s and ignorant, yet the &s;en&s;ible and judi|cious ob&s;erver will always &s;ee through the ma&s;k, and perhaps but de&s;pi&s;e you the more for your hypocritical &s;olemnity. But do not mi&s;take me; while I advi&s;e you to be mode&s;t, I do not advi&s;e you to be &s;heepi&s;h and ba&s;h|ful; far from it. Mode&s;ty and &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s, however alike they may be in appearance, are as different in their nature as any two things can well be. A mode&s;t per&s;on will not talk too much or two high in company, becau&s;e &s;he knows it is improper: a &s;heepi&s;h per&s;on will hardly talk at all, or at lea&s;t not &s;o as to be under&s;tood, becau&s;e &s;he is afraid. A mode&s;t per&s;on looks with a decent a&s;&s;urance; a &s;heepi&s;h one is aba&s;hed, and blu&s;hes at &s;he don't know what. A mode&s;t per&s;on will never contradict the general ta&s;te of the company, unle&s;s it be incon&s;i&s;tent with decency and good manners; a &s;hepi&s;h per&s;on will hardly contradict it, even when it is. The one acts from principle, the other from mere in&s;tinct; the one is guided by the rules of right rea&s;on, and therefore is con&s;i&s;tent in her conduct; the other is guided by no rules at all, and con&s;equently has no uniformity of character.</P>
<P>Let me advi&s;e you carefully to guard again&s;t fal&s;e mode&s;ty, which is one of the greate&s;t enemies of virtue, and perhaps has betrayed young people into as many vices as the mo&s;t abandoned impudence. Never be &s;o extremely mode&s;t as to comply with any thing that is bad, how much &s;oever it may be in vogue; nor ever be a&s;hamed to follow what is good, however &s;ingular or uncommon.</P>
<P>True mode&s;ty is meant to be the pre&s;erver, not the betrayer of your virtue; it will be a kind of guard and protection to your cha&s;tity; it will &s;ecure you from the rudene&s;s and impertinence of the impudent and aban|doned part of the other &s;ex. There is &s;uch a dignity and maje&s;ty in a mode&s;t behaviour, as never fails to command re&s;pect: it confounds and aba&s;hes even the mo&s;t prodigate, and makes them either a&s;hamed or

<HEAD>GOOD-NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE virtue directly oppo&s;ed to anger and peevi&s;hne&s;s, and which I would recommend to your &s;tudy and practice, is humanity and good-nature; a certain meekne&s;s of temper and gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, that makes us happy in our&s;elves, and prompts us to communicate happine&s;s to all around us. This temper of mind, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is rather the gift of nature than the attainment of art. Some people are born with &s;uch a happy con&s;titution, that hardly any thing can di&s;turb or di&s;compo&s;e them. The former may be &s;aid to be more happy than the latter, but not more virtuous, for nothing de&s;erves the name of virtue that is not of our own acqui&s;ition: and, however difficult the ta&s;k may appear, yet this virtue of good-nature, may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure be acquired by every one who will apply her&s;elf to the &s;tudy of it with care and diligence.</P>
<P>In order to excite you to the &s;tudy and practice of good-nature, let me entreat you to con&s;ider the many happy effects that flow from it. It is an inexhau&s;tible fund of inward peace and tranquillity. What the wi&s;e man &s;ays of a good con&s;cience (without which, perhaps, good-nature cannot exi&s;t, at lea&s;t not in its highe&s;t per|fection) may properly enough be applied to this virtue, to wit, that it is "a continual fea&s;t." A per&s;on ble&s;&s;ed with this happy temper of mind, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es within her&s;elf a never-failing &s;ource of joy and plea&s;ure: &s;he derives happine&s;s from almo&s;t every incident and occurrence of life, even from tho&s;e, which to the peevi&s;h and ill-natur|ed, are the cau&s;e of pain and unea&s;ine&s;s.

<HEAD>ENVY.</HEAD>
<P>TO take a &s;incere plea&s;ure in the ble&s;&s;ings and excellencies of others, is a much &s;urer mark of benevolence than to pity their calamities; and you mu&s;t always acknowledge your&s;elf ungenerous and &s;elfi&s;h, whenever you are le&s;s ready to "rejoice with them that do rejoice," than to "weep with them that weep."</P>
<P>If ever your commendations of others are forced from you by the fear of betraying your envy, or if ever you feel a &s;ecret de&s;ire to mention &s;omething that may abate the admiration given them, do not try to conceal the ba&s;e di&s;po&s;ition from your&s;elf, &s;ince that is not the way to cure it.</P>
<P>Human nature is ever liable to corruption, and has in it the &s;eeds of every vice, as well as of every virtue; and the fir&s;t will be continually &s;hooting forth and growing up, if not carefully watched and rooted out as fa&s;t as they appear. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion to purify and exalt us from a &s;tate of imperfection and infirmity, to that which is nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s. Envy would make us mi&s;erable in heaven it&s;elf, could it be ad|mitted there; for we mu&s;t there &s;ee beings far more ex|cellent, and con&s;equently more happy than our&s;elves; and, till we can rejoice in &s;eeing virtue rewarded in proportion to its degree, we can never hope to be among the number of the ble&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>FRIENDSHIP, in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, can only &s;ub&s;i&s;t between per&s;ons of &s;trict integrity, and true genero&s;ity. Before you fancy your&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="30" REF="035911_0016_1007BEF7EF1E8BB8">
of &s;uch a trea&s;ure, you &s;hould examine the value of your own heart, and &s;ee how well it is qualified for &s;o &s;acred a connexion: and then a harder ta&s;k remains, to find out whether the object of your affection is al&s;o endued with the &s;ame virtuous di&s;po&s;ition. Youth and inexpe|rience are ill able to penetrate into characters; the lea&s;t appearance of good attracts their admiration, and they immediately &s;uppo&s;e they have found the object they pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy con&s;ideration, that the judgment can only be formed by experience, which generally comes too late for one's own u&s;e, and is &s;eldom accepted for that of others. I fear it is in vain for me to tell you what dangerous mi&s;takes I made in the early choice of friends; how incapable I then was of finding out &s;uch as were fit for me, and how little I was acquainted with the true nature of friend&s;hip, when I thought my&s;elf mo&s;t fervently engaged in it! I am &s;en&s;ible all this will hardly per&s;uade you to choo&s;e by the eyes of others, or even to &s;u&s;pect that your own may be deceived.</P>
<P>A due regard to reputation is an indi&s;pen&s;able qualifi|cation in the choice of a friend.

The young per&s;on who is carele&s;s of blame, and indiffer|ent to the e&s;teem of the wi&s;e and prudent part of the world, is not only a mo&s;t dangerous companion, but gives a certain proof of the want of rectitude in her own mind. Di&s;cretion is the guardian of all virtues, and when &s;he for&s;akes them, they cannot long re&s;i&s;t the attacks of an enemy. There is a profligacy of &s;pirit in defying the rules of decorum, and de&s;pi&s;ing cen&s;ure, which &s;eldom ends otherwi&s;e than in extreme corruption, and utter ruin. Mode&s;ty and prudence are qualities that early di&s;play them&s;elves, and are ea&s;ily di&s;cerned; where the&s;e do not appear, you &s;hould avoid, not only friend|&s;hip, but every &s;tep towards intimacy, le&s;t your own character &s;hould &s;uffer along with that of your com|panion; but where they &s;hine forth in any eminent de|gree, you may &s;afely cultivate an acquaintance, in the rea&s;onable hope of finding the &s;olid fruits of virtue be|neath

<P>Fancy, I know, will have her &s;hare in friend&s;hip, as well as in love. You mu&s;t plea&s;e, as well as &s;erve me, before I can love you as a friend of my heart. But the talents that plea&s;e for an evening, may not plea&s;e for life. The humorous man &s;oon runs through his &s;tock of odd &s;tories, mimicry, and je&s;ts; and the wit, by con|&s;tantly repeated fla&s;hes, confounds and tires one's intel|lect, in&s;tead of enlivening it with agreeable &s;urprize; but good &s;en&s;e can neither tire nor wear out; it improves by exerci&s;e, and increa&s;es in value the more it is known: the plea&s;ure it gives in conver&s;ation is la&s;ting and &s;atis|factory, becau&s;e it is accompanied with improvement: Its worth is proportioned to the occa&s;ion that calls for it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es higher on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting topics; the heart, as well as the under&s;tanding, finds its account in it; and our noble&s;t intere&s;ts are promoted by the entertainment we receive from &s;uch a companion.</P>

The more magnificently a hou&s;e is furni&s;hed, the more one is di&s;|gu&s;ted with that air of confu&s;ion, which often prevails where attention is wanting in the owner. But, on the other hand, there is a kind of neatne&s;s, which gives a lady the air of a hou&s;e-maid, and makes her exce&s;&s;ively trouble&s;ome to every body, and particularly to her hu&s;|band: in this, as in all branches of economy, I wi&s;h you to avoid all parade and bu&s;tle. Tho&s;e ladies, who pique them&s;elves on the particular excellence of neatne&s;s, are very apt to forget that the decent order of a hou&s;e &s;hould be de&s;igned to promote the convenience and plea&s;ure of tho&s;e who are to be in it; and that, if it is converted into a cau&s;e of trouble and con&s;traint, their hu&s;bands and gue&s;ts would be happier without it.

The be&s;t &s;ign of a hou&s;e being well governed is that nobody's attention is called to any of the little affairs of it, but all goes on &s;o well of cour&s;e that one is not led to make remarks upon any thing, nor to ob&s;erve any extraordinary effort that produces the general re&s;ult of ea&s;e and elegance, which prevails without.</P>

<P>THE utmo&s;t happine&s;s we can hope for in this world is contentment; and, if we aim at any thing higher, we &s;hall meet with nothing but grief and di&s;ap|pointments.</P>
<P>A &s;ure method to &s;ecure content, will be to ob&s;erve the following rules; fir&s;t, never to &s;ee &s;uperiors with en|vy; &s;econdly, to reflect on the various calamities and misfortunes that human nature is &s;ubject to; and, third|ly, to form a regular impartial compari&s;on, between our&s;elves and tho&s;e who are placed below us in the enjoyments of life. Tho&s;e con&s;iderations will fortify and &s;trengthen the mind again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;or|row; will reconcile it to the natural di&s;tre&s;&s;es that befal it, and will prepare it for the enjoyment of peace and tranquillity. Great inconveniences attend running into any extreme. Much of our happine&s;s depends upon an evenne&s;s of temper; in not &s;uffering the &s;cale of our rea&s;on to mount us too high, in the &s;ea&s;on of pro&s;perity, nor to &s;ink us too low with the weight of adver&s;e fortune. Wherefore, my advice is, that you never may exult im|moderately, upon a new acce&s;&s;ion of good, nor be abject|ly ca&s;t down, at the &s;udden approach of evil. The true regard of your own private &s;atisfaction, &s;hould incline you to &s;tability and re&s;ignation, upon any change, and to keep your &s;pirits always calm and even; becau&s;e your life would be a labyrinth of perplexities without it. Had you all the de&s;irable properties in the world, you could be no more than plea&s;ed and contented with them; and, if by a right way of thinking, you can reconcile your&s;elf to your own condition, you will fall very little &s;hort of the mo&s;t complete happine&s;s that mortals can enjoy.</P>

<HEAD>CHASTITY.</HEAD>
<P>CHASTITY is the next virtue that is to fall under your con&s;ideration: no charm can &s;upply its place: without it, beauty is unlovely; wit is mean and wanton; quality contemptible, and good breeding worthle&s;s. Cha&s;tity is &s;o e&s;&s;ential and natural to your &s;ex, that every declination from it is a proportionable receding from womanhood. An immode&s;t woman is a kind of mon&s;ter, di&s;torted from its proper form. She who forfeits her cha&s;tity, withers by degrees into &s;corn and contrition; but &s;he who lives up to its rules, ever flouri&s;hes, like a ro&s;e in June, with all her virgin graces about her&mdash;&s;weet to the &s;en&s;e, and lovely to the eye. Cha&s;|tity heightens all the virtues, which it accompanies; and &s;ets off every great talent that human nature can be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. It is not only an ornament, but al&s;o a guard to virtue. This is the great point of female hon|our, and the lea&s;t &s;lip in a woman's honour is never to be recovered.</P>
<P>This, more than any other virtue, places your &s;ex in the e&s;teem of ours; and invites even tho&s;e to admire it, who have the ba&s;ene&s;s to profane it. I therefore recom|mend it to your approbation, in the minute&s;t circum|&s;tances. Cha&s;tity is a kind of quick and delicate feeling in the &s;oul, which makes her &s;hrink, and withdraw her|&s;elf
<PB N="37" REF="035911_0019_1007BF0075546F70">
from every thing that is wanton, or has danger in it. This makes it &s;o great a check to loo&s;e thoughts, that I pre&s;cribe to you the practice of it in your greate&s;t &s;olitudes, as if the be&s;t judges were to &s;ee and cen&s;ure all you do.</P>
<P>It is reported of one Lucretia, a Roman lady, that hav|ing been ravi&s;hed by Sextus, elde&s;t &s;on to Tarquin, the king of the country, &s;he took a dagger in her hand; and, after having publickly exhorted her relations to revenge her injury on the barbarous ravi&s;her, &s;he plunged it in her bo&s;om, at once putting an end to her life and her di&s;grace. And &s;uch was the opinion which the Romans entertained of this crime, as well as of the fatal con&s;e|quences which followed the commi&s;&s;ion of it, that the whole nation ro&s;e in arms, and not only dethroned the king, and bani&s;hed the royal family, but even, if I may &s;o &s;peak, bani&s;hed kings, in general, making a decree, that, for the future, no king &s;hould ever &s;way the &s;ceptre over the Roman people, but that their government, in&s;tead of a monarchy, &s;hould thenceforth become a republic.</P>

<HEAD>OBEDIENCE TO PARENTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible that young people &s;hould &s;teer their cour&s;e aright in the world, before they are ac|quainted with the &s;ituation of the many dangers that lie in their way; wherefore it is nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould be under the government and direction of tho&s;e, who are appointed, by the laws of nature, to take the charge of their education. If children had but &s;edatene&s;s enough, how readily would they embrace the coun&s;el of their pa|rents; how attentively li&s;ten to their precepts; and how &s;trenuou&s;ly pur&s;ue their advice! They have already walk|ed in the difficult wilderne&s;s of life, and ob&s;erved the va|rious dangers that lurk in the paths of it, to annoy the foot&s;teps of tho&s;e who never trod the way.

not take it ill, if the commands of their parents &s;ometimes &s;eem difficult and di&s;agreeable. Perhaps, upon experi|ment, they may prove as plea&s;ing as if they had followed their own choice. However, this they may be certain of, that all &s;uch cautions are intended out of true love, by tho&s;e who are more experienced than them&s;elves, and therefore better judges what their conduct &s;hould be.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who honour their parents, it is promi&s;ed by the word of eternal truth, that their days &s;hould be long in the land of their inheritance. From this we may learn how amiable the performance of this duty is in the &s;ight of Heaven. Let your obedience to your mother be there|fore your delight and exerci&s;e. God has given her pow|er over you, to bring you up in his fear and &s;ervice. She was the guardian of your childhood, and is the guide of your yet inexperienced youth; this mu&s;t naturally enliv|en your love for her, and melt you into the gentle&s;t obe|dience to her. Therefore let filial affection be your gov|erning principle; and behave your&s;elf towards her with all humility and ob&s;ervance. Let no pretence of your being in the right, ever provoke you to an&s;wer her with indifference or contempt. You mu&s;t love her, and be grieved at every thing that di&s;quiets her. You are to plea&s;e her in all circum&s;tances; to comfort her on all occa&s;ions; to obey her commands with plea&s;ure; to con|&s;ult her in all affairs, and to reverence all her precepts. Con&s;ider, that all this is but a moderate return of grati|tude, for the toils and hard&s;hips, expen&s;e and inquietudes, &s;he has &s;uffered for you; for the care &s;he has taken to educate and in&s;truct you; for the good examples &s;he has &s;hewn you, and for the hone&s;t principles, and improve|ments of the mind, &s;he has conveyed unto you.</P>

<HEAD>THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.</HEAD>
<P>MANY are the arguments that e&s;tabli&s;h this great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Fir&s;t, it is rea&s;onable to believe, that an immaterial being, enriched with &s;o many beautiful facul|ties,
<PB N="39" REF="035911_0020_1007BF03124BCAC8">
as the human &s;oul is, can naturally have no internal principle of corruption, or be &s;ubject to annihilation; and hence ari&s;es a certainty of its being a particle of an im|mortal and eternal e&s;&s;ence. Again, its love of exi&s;tence; its hopes of undying happine&s;s; its &s;atisfaction in the practice of virtue; its remor&s;e on the commi&s;&s;ion of vice; and the delight it takes, in the contemplation of its divine original, are irre&s;i&s;tible proofs of its immortal nature. He mu&s;t be lo&s;t in &s;tupidity, who can either imagine, or believe, that a thinking being, which is in a perpetual progre&s;s of improvement, that is always capable of new accompli&s;hments and further enlargements, and is &s;till travelling on, from perfection to perfection, &s;hould, in the beginning of her inquiries, and after a few di&s;cov|eries of her own excellencies and acquirements, fall away into nothing, and peri&s;h with corruption. Be&s;ides, the ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and veracity of God, are all concerned in the proof of her eternity. In this world, man, let his talents be ever &s;o great, and his labour ever &s;o con&s;tant, can never take in his full mea&s;ure of knowl|edge; can never e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;oul in virtue, or come up to the perfection of his nature. Would it then agree with the infinite ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom of God, to create &s;uch noble beings, for &s;o mean a purpo&s;e, as to peri&s;h with the bea&s;ts of the field? That would be, to give us rea&s;on to be abortive, talents not to be exerted, and ca|pacities not to be gratified; which would de&s;troy that in|finite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Deity, that &s;hines through all his works.</P>
<P>We are to look upon this world as a nur&s;ery for the next, and are only to receive our fir&s;t rudiments of exi&s;t|ence here, and afterwards to be tran&s;planted into eternal dominions; where our immortal &s;ouls will &s;till be add|ing knowledge to knowledge, and virtue to virtue; and will &s;hine forever with new acce&s;&s;ions of glory to all eter|nity. This is the triumphant plea&s;ure of our &s;ouls: this is the highe&s;t perfection of our nature; and it mu&s;t be a pro&s;pect plea&s;ing even to God him&s;elf, to &s;ee his crea|tion drawing nearer to him by greater degrees of re&s;em|blance.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO you have "thought as a child, and under&s;tood as a child; but it is time to put away childi&s;h things."&mdash;If you de&s;ire to live in peace and honour, in favour with God and man, and to die in the glorious hope of ri&s;ing from the grave to a life of endle&s;s happine&s;s; if the&s;e things appear worthy your ambition, you mu&s;t &s;et out in earne&s;t in the pur&s;uit of them. Vir|tue and happine&s;s are not attained by chance, nor by a cold and languid approbation; they mu&s;t be &s;ought with ardour, attended to with diligence, and every a&s;&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t be eagerly embraced, that may enable you to obtain them. Con&s;ider that good and evil are now before you; that, if you do not heartily choo&s;e and love the one, you mu&s;t undoubtedly be the wretched victim of the other.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep mu&s;t be to awaken your mind to a &s;en&s;e of the importance of the ta&s;k before you; which is no le&s;s than to bring your frail nature to that degree of Chri&s;tian perfection, which is to qualify it for immortality, and, without which it is nece&s;&s;arily incapable of happine&s;s; for, it is a truth never to be forgotten, that God has an|nexed happine&s;s to virtue, and mi&s;ery to vice, by the un|changeable nature of things; and that a wicked being (while he continues &s;uch) is in a natural incapacity of en|joying happine&s;s, even with the concurrence of all tho&s;e outward circum&s;tances, which in a virtuous mind would produce it.</P>
<P>As there are degrees of virtue and vice, &s;o there are of reward and puni&s;hment, both here and hereafter: but do not aim only at e&s;caping the dreadful doom of the wicked; let your de&s;ires take a nobler flight, and a&s;pire after tho&s;e tran&s;cendant honours, and that brighter crown of glory, which await tho&s;e who have excelled in virtue; and let the animating thought, that every &s;ecret effort to gain his favour is noted by your all-&s;eeing Judge, and that he will, with infinite mercy, proportion his good|ne&s;s to your labour, excite every faculty of your &s;oul to

plea&s;e and &s;erve him. To this end, you mu&s;t inform your under&s;tanding what you ought to believe and to do. You mu&s;t correct and purify your heart; cheri&s;h and im|prove all its good affections; and continually mortify tho&s;e that are evil. You mu&s;t form and govern your temper and manners, according to the laws of benevo|lence and ju&s;tice, and qualify your&s;elf, by all means in your power, for an u&s;eful and agreeable member of &s;o|ciety. All this, you &s;ee, is no light bu&s;ine&s;s, nor can it be performed without a &s;incere and earne&s;t application of the mind, as to its great and con&s;tant object.</P>
<P>True devotion is not a melancholy &s;entiment that de|pre&s;&s;es the &s;pirits, and excludes the ideas of plea&s;ure which youth is &s;o fond of: on the contrary, there is nothing &s;o friendly to enjoyment, &s;o productive of true plea&s;ure, &s;o peculiarly &s;uited to the warmth and inno|cency of a youthful heart. Do not therefore think it too &s;oon to turn your mind to God; but offer him the fir&s;t fruits of your under&s;tanding and affections: and be a&s;&s;ured, that the more you increa&s;e in love to him, and delight in his laws, the more you will increa&s;e in hap|pine&s;s, in excellence and honour;&mdash;that, in proportion as you improve in true piety, you will become dear and amiable to your fellow creatures, contented and peace|ful in your&s;elf, and qualified to enjoy the be&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of this life, as well as to inherit the glorious promi&s;e of immortality.</P>
<P>What an example is &s;et before us in our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;|ter! How is his whole life, from his earlie&s;t youth, ded|icated to the pur&s;uit of true wi&s;dom, and to the practice of the mo&s;t exalted virtue! When you &s;ee him, at twelve years of age, in the temple, among&s;t the doctors, hear|ing them, and a&s;king them que&s;tions, on the &s;ubject of religion, and a&s;toni&s;hing them with his under&s;tanding and an&s;wers,&mdash;you will &s;ay perhaps, "Well might the Son of God, even at tho&s;e years, be far wi&s;er than the aged; but can a mortal child emulate &s;uch heavenly wi&s;dom? Can &s;uch a pattern be propo&s;ed to my imita|tion?" Yes, my dear, remember that he hath bequeath|ed to you his heavenly wi&s;dom, as far as concerns your good. He has left you &s;uch declarations of his will,

and of the con&s;equences of your actions, as you are, even now, fully able to under&s;tand, if you will but at|tend to them. If then you will imitate his zeal for knowledge, if you will delight in gaining information and improvement, you may even now become "wi&s;e unto &s;alvation." Unmoved by the prai&s;e he acquired among&s;t the&s;e learned men, you &s;ee him meekly return to the &s;ubjection of a child under tho&s;e who appeared to be his parents, though he was in reality their Lord: you &s;ee him return to live with them, to work for them, and to be the joy and &s;olace of their lives; till the time came, when he was to enter on that &s;cene of public ac|tion, for which his heavenly Father had &s;ent him, from his own right hand, to take upon him the form of a poor carpenter's &s;on. What a le&s;&s;on of humility is this, and of obedience to parents! When having received the glorious te&s;timony from heaven, of his being the beloved Son of the Mo&s;t High, he enters on his public mini&s;try, &mdash;what an example does he give us, of the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive and con&s;tant benevolence! How are all his hours &s;pent in doing good to the &s;ouls and bodies of men!

In&s;tead of u&s;ing the almighty power, which accompanied him, to the purpo&s;e of exalt|ing him&s;elf, and treading down his enemies, he makes no other u&s;e of it, than to heal and to &s;ave.</P>

Politene&s;s of behaviour, and the attaining &s;uch branches of knowl|edge, and &s;uch arts and accompli&s;hments as are proper to your &s;ex, capacity, and &s;tation, will prove &s;o valuable to your&s;elf through life, and will make you &s;o de&s;irable a companion, that the neglect of them may rea&s;onably be deemed a neglect of duty, &s;ince it is undoubtedly our duty to cultivate the powers entru&s;ted to us, and to ren|der our&s;elves as perfect as we can.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have often ob&s;erved that nothing is &s;o &s;trong a recommendation on a &s;light acquaintance as polite|ne&s;s; nor does it lo&s;e its value by time or intimacy, when pre&s;erved, as it ought to be, in the neare&s;t con|nexions, and &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hips.

<P>Whatever tends to embelli&s;h your fancy, to enlighten your under&s;tanding, and furni&s;h you with ideas to reflect upon when alone, or to conver&s;e upon in company, is certainly well worth your acqui&s;ition. The wretched expedient, to which ignorance &s;o often drives our &s;ex,
<PB N="45" REF="035911_0023_1007BF0ADC3A9BB8">

Endle&s;s plea&s;ures, to tho&s;e who have a ta&s;te for them, might be derived from the endle&s;s variety to be &s;ound in the compo&s;ition of this globe and its inhabitants.

<HEAD>THE FOLLY OF PRIDE.</HEAD>
<P>MARY now went up to Leonora, a rich Baronet's daughter, and taking her good-naturedly by the arm, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;Come, Leonora, let us take a walk round the garden; the race does not &s;uit well with our fine holiday dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But Leonora was very proud, and drew her arm ha&s;ti|ly back, &s;aying&mdash;Pray, Mi&s;s Jones, take care, or you will rumple the lace on my &s;leeves. She then drew up her head, bridled her chin, and turned up her no&s;e; as

much as to &s;ay, a trade&s;man's daughter like you ought not to be &s;o familiar with me. The lace on my dre&s;s is very rich, and the flowers the fine&s;t that have lately come from France, continued &s;he; my mother purcha&s;|ed them, that I might have &s;omething to di&s;tingui&s;h me, when I was forced to mix with nobody know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who; for I am a young lady of a good family, and it is in|&s;upportable to &s;ee citizens daughters imitate, in every thing, people of condition, &s;aid the lady who &s;o often vi&s;its my mother, Lady Up&s;tart. I had the&s;e pa&s;te book|les lately &s;ent home; they were bought of the Prince of Wales' jeweller: what pedlar &s;et yours? I never &s;aw any thing &s;o vulgar. I put mine on for the fir&s;t time when I &s;ung at a private concert before the Prince. For you mu&s;t know, that I am allowed to &s;ing charmingly; Lord Smoothtongue, who dined at our hou&s;e the other day, &s;aid that I had a fine angelic Italian voice. He &s;poke in French to me too for half an hour, and declared, that I prattled like a native of France. I &s;hall &s;oon begin to learn Italian; it is not very difficult; but nothing in|deed is difficult to me; I &s;hall be able to &s;peak it in &s;ix months.</P>
<P>Thus did &s;he run on, till poor Mary was quite weary of her fooli&s;h pride and chat, and longed to leave her, to enjoy her vain thoughts alone. She looked anxiou&s;ly round for an opportunity, and &s;aw a young lady coming whom &s;he had been in company with before. She in|&s;tantly left Leonora, and joined Charlotte, &s;aying&mdash;Will you take a walk with me, for this is a &s;weet garden? With all my heart, an&s;wered &s;he; and they turned down another walk, and left Leonora, with her fine lace and pa&s;te buckles, to count her &s;teps, and look in vain at the trees for admiration.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the company gathered round the&s;e two girls, and all agreed that Leonora was haughty and fooli&s;h. Let her go, &s;aid Charles; a Mi&s;s who knows &s;o much is not fit company for us; we might rumple the lace on her fine dre&s;s. Who will play at que&s;tions and commands?

<P><PB N="48" REF="035911_0025_1007BF109312EB58">The haughty, vain Leonora, who &s;aw her&s;elf excluded from this amu&s;ement, was ready to bite her nails with vexation. She walked up and down the path with a grave &s;tep, looking at them as if &s;he expected to be in|vited by &s;ome one, to play with them; but no one took notice of her. She pa&s;&s;ed by with a pretty pocket-book in her hand, hoping that they would a&s;k to &s;ee it, and admire its &s;ilver cla&s;p and enamelled figures. But, in|&s;tead of that, the little folks began to whi&s;per, and then bur&s;t into a loud laugh.</P>
<P>Leonora perceiving that they were laughing at her, turned away blu&s;hing with anger, and at la&s;t began to weep, becau&s;e &s;he could not vent her pa&s;&s;ion on them.</P>
<P>Then &s;he happened to meet her father, who was a &s;en&s;ible man, and &s;aw with pain that his wife &s;poiled her daughter. What is the matter with you? Why do you weep? Has any accident befallen you? How &s;hould I laugh, an&s;wered &s;he; tho&s;e children have no manners. They &s;it there together, and laugh and play without in|viting me. They appear what they are, poor vulgar creatures; I ought not to have expected better from them. Would you believe it, when I pa&s;&s;ed by, they laughed me out of countenance. Is not that very rude and ill-bred?</P>
<P>True, &s;aid her father, it was indeed very rude; but, perhaps, you offended them fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I, an&s;wered &s;he; I have done nothing to them; I would not demean my&s;elf to quarrel with &s;uch&mdash;. She &s;topped &s;hort, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw a frown on her father's brow. She then related to him, that &s;he had only informed them how her &s;inging was admired, and that &s;he &s;poke French remarkably well. I told them indeed, added &s;he, that I was &s;oon to learn Italian, and kept them at a di&s;tance, that they might not tear my lace, they were &s;o rude. Leonora! Leonora! &s;aid he, you have acted very &s;imply. If you wi&s;h to be re&s;pected and loved, and that people &s;hould like to be in your company, you mu&s;t not always &s;peak of your&s;elf and your talents, for you will then cer|tainly di&s;gu&s;t them.

<PB N="49" REF="035911_0025_1007BF109312EB58">
I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that they laughed at you. If a man were to be in my company, who only talked of him&s;elf, and took care to let me &s;ee that he thought me an in|ferior, becau&s;e he had a larger fortune than my&s;elf, I &s;hould laugh in his face. For a proud man is always ri|diculous.</P>
<P>He took her out of the garden and &s;ent her home, tell|ing her as he led her to the carriage, that he would take away her fine clothes, and &s;end her to a little farm-hou&s;e in the country, if &s;he did not &s;oon appear to have more &s;en&s;e; for pride is folly.

<HEAD>THE STEP-MOTHER. DETRACTION.</HEAD>
<P>MARY chatted during this time with little Emilia, Mr. Goodman's daughter, who gave her a de|&s;cription of every thing remarkable in her village and hou&s;e. Among&s;t other things, &s;he &s;aid, that her pre&s;ent mother was not her own mother, but a &s;tep-mother: her own mother, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had never known, becau&s;e &s;he died when &s;he was an infant. A &s;tep-mother, do you &s;ay? replied Mary, quite &s;urpri&s;ed; a &s;tep-mother! Poor child! I have always heard that &s;tep-mothers were very cruel; that they beat poor children, and do not give them enough to eat. Do not believe &s;uch &s;tories, dear Mary, an&s;wered Emilia! I remember I heard the &s;ame thing, but I found it very different. It is po&s;&s;ible there may have been many cruel &s;tep-mothers; and for that rea&s;on I wi&s;h that all good children may keep their own parents; but my &s;tep-mother is certainly the be&s;t woman in the world. She has her own children, and my moth|er's, but &s;he loves us all as well as her own. The cake and fruit &s;he di&s;tributes among&s;t us are always in equal &s;hares: when they are naughty, they are always puni&s;h|ed as &s;everely as I am, when I am carele&s;s or neglect my work.

and per&s;i&s;ting in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> though &s;he took me gently by the hand, and told me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat a dreadful thing a lie was. And this is her u&s;ual method; &s;he melts me by her kindne&s;s, and I promi&s;e to try to become better; for I know that I acquired &s;ome bad habits before my father married again. What then would have become of me if I had not had a &s;tep-mother? My own mother was gone to heaven; I never knew her: but my &s;tep-mother had pity on me, and has taught me to read and work; nay, to tell truth, and be orderly: my father loves me twice as well as he did; and I love my father, though people &s;ay I am pa&s;&s;ionate and have a bad temper. I wi&s;h to be good. And then, when I was &s;ick, yes, very &s;ick, &s;he &s;at up with me all night, and was &s;o kind&mdash;who knows where I &s;hould have been now, but for her?</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones did not meet with &s;uch an agreeable com|panion. She walked with the &s;i&s;ter of an amiable young lady, lately married to a very worthy man. She found her conver&s;ation very tire&s;ome; nay, it gave her great pain. She had been brought up by a relation; and, in her childhood, been with thoughtle&s;s, idle people; and had learned from them the dreadful cu&s;tom of &s;landering, or &s;peaking ill of every body. Mrs. Jones did not yet know her evil propen&s;ity: &s;he took her arm in a friendly manner, and &s;aid, your &s;i&s;ter's marriage with &s;uch a wor|thy man gave me great plea&s;ure. I congratulate you, and &s;incerely wi&s;h that they may all their lives enjoy the happine&s;s they merit. Hannah (for that was the name of this malicious girl) thanked her coldly for the part &s;he took in the happine&s;s of her family. But, con|tinued &s;he, with a &s;neering laugh, I know not whether the doctor's happine&s;s, or, if you plea&s;e, the profe&s;&s;or's, will be &s;o very great. Now it is only the honey-moon. But when he has his wife at home a month or two, he will &s;oon &s;ee what a fine choice he has made. I really do not know what he will do with her. She knows nothing of the management of a family; and &s;he has &s;uch a bad temper, God help tho&s;e who are to live always with her! for my part, I am very glad that &s;he is now out of our hou&s;e. The worthy profe&s;&s;or will have trouble enough with her; but then, (&s;he laughed again)
<PB N="51" REF="035911_0026_1007BF1275FA09F8">
the worthy profe&s;&s;or has no right to find fault with her. I know him, and know all his tricks. I mu&s;t not mention them: but, Mrs. Jones, if you knew what I know, you would form quite a different opinion of him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones now te&s;tified her &s;urpri&s;e, and a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he never had heard any thing but good of him and her &s;i&s;ter. Be&s;ides, Mr. Goodman had prai&s;ed them, and he was certainly a worthy, &s;en&s;ible man.</P>
<P>He may be a learned man, an&s;wered Hannah, but he is nothing more. He leaves all things at &s;ixes and &s;ev|ens; and if any one will give him a gla&s;s of wine, he will &s;ay all that is kind and good of them for it. I do not love to &s;peak ill of others; but I know very well what they &s;ay of his wife; ha! ha! ha! &s;he can &s;kin a flint in the management of her hou&s;e; you will &s;ee more &s;un&s;hine than bread there, I fear.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones earne&s;tly endeavoured to defend her friends; for &s;he knew them, and would not &s;uffer &s;uch artful cal|umny to &s;hake her good opinion. But the more &s;he de|fended their characters, the more ill this malicious girl &s;aid of them. She then turned the conver&s;ation to other per&s;ons; and &s;he had &s;omething bad to tell of every one. Mrs. Jones li&s;tened above half an hour to the&s;e malicious &s;landers, for &s;he could not &s;top her: unable to bear it any longer with patience, &s;he looked at her with contempt, and abruptly interrupted her. Madam, &s;aid &s;he to her, you have recollected &s;omething ill of every per&s;on you have mentioned; I &s;hould be glad to hear you, ju&s;t to turn the torrent, &s;ay &s;omething good of them.</P>
<P>How can I help it, &s;aid &s;he, if people are not better? How can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t I &s;peak well of them, when they have nothing good in them?</P>
<P>What, continued Mrs. Jones, are you not a&s;hamed of your&s;elf? Have you heard nothing good of any of tho&s;e per&s;ons you have been calumniating? I love and e&s;teem them all, becau&s;e I know them to be good; but if I only believed half what you have &s;aid of them, they would &s;ink &s;o low in my opinion, that they would forfeit the place they have in my e&s;teem: I &s;hould be forced to de&s;pi&s;e them, as being de&s;titute of virtue and honour.
<PB N="52" REF="035911_0027_1007BF1606D96330">
Is not this dete&s;table? Hannah! Hannah! if you robbed me of my watch or pur&s;e, it would be very wrong; but it would not be &s;o blameable an action as &s;landering, if you deprived me of my reputation, and thus robbed me of my honour! However precious my watch may be, I can purcha&s;e another if it be &s;tolen; but gold cannot rub out the &s;tains you might fix on my good name. But only think how much you have injured your&s;elf. How can I re&s;pect a per&s;on who has &s;poken in &s;uch a &s;tyle of her own &s;i&s;ter and brother! If I were to repeat to them, to Mr. Goodman, or any of the other per&s;ons you have mentioned, only half what you have &s;aid of them, what do you &s;uppo&s;e would be the con&s;equence?</P>
<P>What do you &s;ay, dear Madam? (interrupted the frightened Hannah) &s;urely you will not repeat what I have &s;poken to you, becau&s;e I con&s;idered you as my friend. I did not mean any harm.</P>
<P>If I (an&s;wered Mrs. Jones) &s;pare you, you will &s;oon betray your&s;elf: you will &s;oon lo&s;e every friend you have. All your acquaintance will fly from you; they will de&s;pi&s;e and loathe you. We loathe a &s;landerer as we do a viper. I, at lea&s;t, &s;hall take care in future not to come near you, le&s;t you &s;hould again fa&s;ten on my ear, as you have done to-day, to in&s;til poi&s;on into my heart; for whoever &s;peaks ill to me of all the world, will certainly not &s;peak well of me when my back is turned.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he ha&s;tily left the malicious girl &s;tanding alone, not knowing what to do with her&s;elf, &s;he was &s;o vexed. She walked angrily up and down the garden; and, meeting her &s;i&s;ter, would have begun to &s;peak ill of Mrs. Jones; but &s;he would not hear her, and turned from her, &s;aying, I know you &s;i&s;ter, and I know Mrs. Jones. I have not time to li&s;ten to you.</P>
<P>This made her very angry. When the whole company were cheerful, and walked about chatting and laughing, Hannah flew to a dark corner, and &s;eated her&s;elf there, the prey of her own malice.</P>

<HEAD>CHILDREN TAUGHT THE USEFULNESS OF SERVANTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE frequent amu&s;ements in which Mr. Jones's family had been engaged for &s;ome time pa&s;t, inter|rupted too much their regular employments. Charles had not done what his ma&s;ter every day required; Ma|ry's work was left unfini&s;hed; Mrs. Jones had &s;everal things to do in the family, and Mr Jones many accounts to &s;ettle, which made him &s;ay to his wife and children, we have lately enjoyed much plea&s;ure, perhaps more than we ought, becau&s;e we have neglected our nece&s;&s;ary employments. But now it is proper for us to return to our re&s;pective occupations with fre&s;h vigour; el&s;e we &s;hall lo&s;e by degrees all de&s;ire for employment, and our whole family would then fall into &s;uch di&s;order, that we &s;hould no longer find any comfort in it.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired Charles, after he had given this caution, to prepare his exerci&s;e, and went him&s;elf to his compting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the children did not much reli&s;h work, and even Mr. Jones him&s;elf found it more trouble&s;ome than u&s;ual; but imperceptibly every thing returned into its former order. Every one fulfilled his appointed ta&s;k; and finding them&s;elves very well, they were happily con|vinced that regular employment affords more real &s;atis|faction than continual amu&s;ements and fea&s;ts.</P>
<P>This order was not interrupted till the middle of October, when the two maids begged Mrs. Jones to let them go to a fair in a neighbouring village. Scarcely were they gone out of the hou&s;e, when the man &s;ervant entered, and, bur&s;ting into a violent fit of crying, he could only bring out&mdash;What &s;hall I do? what &s;hall I do? Mrs. Jones was alarmed, and a&s;ked him what ailed him; but he could only an&s;wer&mdash;They &s;ay my father is dying. Mr. Jones pitied the poor man, and a&s;ked if he wi&s;hed to go and nur&s;e him during his illne&s;s? O yes! O yes! &s;aid the man; let me but &s;ee him before he dies, or I

&s;hall never know a happy day again! Mr. Jones then in&s;tantly gave him leave to go, &s;aying, I would rather do all your work my&s;elf, than keep you from your &s;ick father. Go, and attend him; and a&s;k my wife for &s;omething to take with you, to revive his &s;pirits. Then Harry &s;oon ha&s;tened away, with his pockets full of nour|i&s;hing things for the poor &s;ick man.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones determined to avail her&s;elf of this opportu|nity, to impre&s;s a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on on the minds of her chil|dren; and would not &s;end for any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, though all the &s;ervants were ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>They having left every thing in order, much incon|venience was not felt during the remainder of the day; but the next morning, Mary, going to wa&s;h her&s;elf, found no water, and was obliged to go to the pump for it her|&s;elf, trembling from head to foot. The children now felt the ab&s;ence of the &s;ervants, and how much they went indebted to them for waiting on them. When breakfa&s;t time came, the milk was brought; but there were no clean ba&s;ons to put it in, and the children mu&s;t drink out of tho&s;e in which &s;ome milk remained &s;ince the day before, or wa&s;h them them&s;elves. When they entered the parlour, every thing was in di&s;order and out of its place; all &s;tood as they had left them the night before; the floor was covered with crumbs, bits of paper, and du&s;t; in &s;hort, it looked like a dwelling in which idle people lived.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones &s;aid, that to-day &s;he mu&s;t du&s;t and &s;weep the room her&s;elf, &s;ince no one thought of doing it for her.</P>
<P>The children, who dearly loved their mother, would not &s;uffer her to do it, but began to work them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Mary took the broom and &s;wept it clean, with &s;ome labour; and Charles put the things in order.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the wind ro&s;e, and made the panes rattle; and the pattering of the rain and hail rendered it &s;till more dreary. The poor children's teeth chattered, their fingers were &s;tiff with cold, and they a&s;ked their mother if they were not to have a fire to-day?</P>
<P>I &s;hould be very glad of a fire, &s;he replied, but I have nobody to light it. If then you do not choo&s;e to &s;tand trembling, you mu&s;t contrive to make a fire your&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="035911_0028_1007BF18DC1C03B0">Charles lighted &s;ome matches, and put them into the grate, but they went out: he tried again, and &s;ometimes the wood caught fire; but they had not placed the cin|ders properly to admit air to draw up the blaze, &s;o it went out again; the wood did not burn. Mary a&s;&s;i&s;ted as well as &s;he could; but as &s;he had never lighted a fire before, &s;he did not know how to make it, &s;o her help was of no avail. They &s;tood trembling and crying till Charles's ma&s;ter luckily came in, and told them how they ought to place the wood, and pile the cinders light|ly over it, &s;o as to admit the air; and not heave a quan|tity of fre&s;h coals on, which were damp, and would not readily burn, till the flame had &s;ome &s;trength to curl around them.</P>
<P>They were now comfortable and warm; the children rubbed their hands, rejoicing, and &s;aying, now we have lighted it, we will not &s;oon &s;tir out of the warm room. But &s;carcely was Charles &s;eated by the &s;ide of his ma&s;ter, when Mr. Jones entered with &s;ome letters in his hand, which mu&s;t in&s;tantly be taken to the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Here, Charles, &s;aid he, run immediately; the&s;e letters mu&s;t be carried to the po&s;t-office. Oh, dear father, cried he, I would gladly go; but &s;ee what dreadful weather it is! it rains violently; and how it blows! may I wait till the &s;hower is over? Fie, fie, the letters mu&s;t go: the po&s;t never waits for good weather. Come, &s;tart up quickly, le&s;t he &s;hould be gone. Then Charles ran away, and came back quite wet: he would have changed his clothes, but had not time; for his father &s;ent him out again with &s;ome other me&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>Mary could not &s;tay much longer by the fire, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;everal things to do in the kitchen. When it &s;truck one, they came again into the parlour, and clap|ped their hands when they heard they were to have mutton-chops and apple-dumplings for dinner, of which they were very fond. But, when they were ready, the cloth was not laid, nor the &s;alt-&s;ellars brought in, nor the gla&s;&s;es wa&s;hed. Mrs. Jones had taken care to &s;end her hu&s;band his dinner warm into his little compting-hou&s;e, where he had a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to do. But &s;he left the children to prepare the table for them&s;elves;

and, before every thing was ready, full half an hour had &s;lipped away. They now &s;eated them&s;elves at table, but the mutton was cold, and the dumplings overdone, &s;o that their dinner did not ta&s;te half as good as they had expected.</P>
<P>After dinner they had &s;till many things to do, and were &s;o dreadfully fatigued in the evening that they thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them&s;elves on a &s;ofa, &s;carcely able to move a limb. I could not have believed, &s;aid Mary to Charles, that the &s;ervants had &s;o much to do: now I feel it; and I will never give them unnece&s;&s;ary trouble again. Poor peo|ple! they are obliged to wait on us the whole day. When we are &s;leeping comfortably, in our warm beds, they are forced to get up to light our fires and &s;weep our rooms, that we may find every thing in order when we ri&s;e. When it rains and blows hard, we &s;it in a warm comfortable room; but they mu&s;t go out, and not wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t till the &s;hower is over.</P>
<P>In the winter, when it freezes &s;o hard that their fin|gers are quite benumbed with cold, they mu&s;t go to the well for water. How often they are obliged to eat their dinners cold; and &s;ometimes through our fault, I fear. I have frequently been ill-natured to them; I am now very &s;orry for it. I am, indeed, very &s;orry!</P>
<P>And &s;o am I, interrupted Charles, very &s;orry; for I have often forgotten my&s;elf, and &s;poken very improperly to the &s;ervants. I mu&s;t tell you what vexes me: I late|ly called Henry a blockhead, becau&s;e he forgot to clean my &s;hoes, though the poor fellow had been running about the whole day for my father: but, believe me, I will never do it again; I will always be civil to Henry, Jen|ny and Catharine, when I want them to do any thing for me. I will take care never to &s;peak ha&s;tily to them; and, above all, not to call them names. Poor Henry, how he cried about his father! I wi&s;h I had not called him a blockhead! I &s;hall not be ea&s;y till I a&s;k him to forgive me. Mary made the &s;ame re&s;olution; and they both longed for the return of the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The next morning the two maids returned; but Cath|arine was &s;ent with &s;ome medicines to Henry's father; and, for three days, the children were obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t

Jenny to do the work of the hou&s;e; and at night they were &s;o tired, that they did nothing but wi&s;h for the next day, hoping that Catharine, at lea&s;t, would come back. The fourth day, Mary was &s;tanding at the window, think|ing how much work &s;he &s;hould have to do the next day, and almo&s;t afraid to think of it, when &s;he heard &s;ome one ring the bell; &s;he threw up the window&mdash;it was Catharine; and at the &s;ame time Henry ran up the &s;teps. What joy! She forgot to pull down the &s;a&s;h. Charles! Charles! cried &s;he, Catharine is come! Henry is come!

Their plea&s;ure was &s;till greater, when Henry informed them that his father would &s;oon be well.</P>
<P>The next day every thing was again in order, and the&s;e children never afterwards behaved rudely to the &s;ervants; on the contrary, they were always civil and good-natured to them, and not only pitied them, when they had more work than u&s;ual to do, but endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; and re&s;olved never more to give unnece&s;|&s;ary trouble to tho&s;e who had at all times &s;o many hard|&s;hips to bear.</P>

<HEAD>AGAINST CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. Jones and his family were, one day walking through a field ju&s;t &s;own with wheat, James, all at once, &s;prang forward, bent down on the ground, then &s;tarted up again, threw his hat before him, as if to catch &s;omething, and then darted forward again. Mary, who was curious to know what he had in his eye, ran after him. At la&s;t he caught what he pur&s;ued, as Mary came up with him, and both rejoiced at having taken a little pri&s;|oner. Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Jones were in conver|&s;ation, and did not ob&s;erve them. However, they were &s;oon obliged to &s;top, for they heard Mary &s;cream out, in a terrified tone&mdash;Dear James, ah! do not do it; pray,

Mr. Jones could not imagine what the children were di&s;put|ing about, but waved his hand for them to come near him. Dear father, &s;aid Mary, you do not know what a wicked boy James is! he has ju&s;t caught a field-mou&s;e, and for all I can &s;ay, will cut its ears and tail off. The poor mou&s;e! it never did him any harm! he has already op|ened his knife! only look at him. James came up &s;mil|ing, holding the mou&s;e in one hand, and the knife in the other.

<P>By no means: I would not give it for a thou|&s;and mice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jones.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, there appears in the &s;truc|ture of this little mou&s;e's body a thou&s;and times more contrivance than in your watch. Look at this little ear, through which it hears all that pa&s;&s;es round it: through this organ it was warned when you pur&s;ued it; and the&s;e pretty eyes, in which the forms of all the objects before it are painted; and the&s;e &s;harp teeth, with which it can gnaw the harde&s;t grain; and the&s;e neatly turned paws; this &s;kin as &s;oft as velvet.

Put your hand on its brea&s;t, and feel how its heart beats, to pu&s;h the blood through its little veins. Your watch may

be very ingeniou&s;ly made; but do you think it would ever produce any little watches? To this degree of per|fection they can never be carried. The mo&s;t beautiful things made by man are dead, and without &s;en&s;e: God alone can give life and rea&s;on.</P>

<P>But &s;till mice do harm; they devour the poor pea&s;ant's wheat and rye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jones.</SPEAKER>
<P>The injury they do is very trifling. They commonly only gather up the grains which the farmer lets fall; and the mo&s;t part of it would probably peri&s;h, if tho&s;e little notable mice did not carry it to their ne&s;ts.

<P>Then, indeed, it is time to de&s;troy them; but without tormenting them; and they &s;hould be put to death as quickly as po&s;&s;ible. If the torments they en|dured would bring back the wheat, or teach them hon|e&s;ty, there would be &s;ome excu&s;e for it; but this mou&s;e will not be le&s;s a thief after you have cut off its ears and tail.</P>

<SPEAKER>James.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I will kill the little thief before he does any more harm.</P>

<P>Ah! my dear James! cried Mary, do not kill it; give me the little mou&s;e; I pray you give it me! Can you deny me?</P>
<P>He gave it her, and, as &s;oon as &s;he got it, &s;he let it run away, calling after it&mdash;Run, run, poor animal, till you find again your little children.</P>
<P>Both Mr. and Mrs. Jones were plea&s;ed with her. Mrs. Jones ki&s;&s;ed Mary, and &s;aid, good girl! you have perhaps &s;aved the lives of four or five little mice, who mu&s;t have peri&s;hed with hunger if their mother had been killed.</P>
<P>Mr. Jones &s;till continued the &s;ubject. He &s;aid, that the &s;malle&s;t animals were of &s;ome u&s;e; and that a good man ought not to kill the lea&s;t worm, unle&s;s it injured him, or that its death would be u&s;eful to him; but even in that ca&s;e it would be unju&s;t and cruel to torment them.</P>

<HEAD>OF FLOWERS.</HEAD>
<P>FLOWERS are formed to plea&s;e us, and it is for our &s;akes that they have received their lovely ap|pearances: no eye but ours can enjoy their beauties: the animals never &s;eem to be affected with plea&s;ure, when they behold them; nor do they ever &s;top to con&s;ider them with attention: they confound them with the com|mon herbage of the field; they trample on the mo&s;t beau|tiful of the tribe, and are perfectly in&s;en&s;ible of this or|nament of the earth. Whereas, man, amid&s;t a crowd of objects and riches that &s;urround him, di&s;tingui&s;hes and pur&s;ues the flowers with a peculiar complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e an agreeable corre&s;pondence with our eyes, and a &s;et of powerful attractions, that invite us to approach them. Whenever we gather them, they pre&s;ent us with new perfections in proportion to our re|garding them with nearer attention. The greate&s;t part of them not only regale our view with the beauty and arrangement of their colours, but gently delight our &s;mell with an excellent perfume; and, when they have gratified our &s;en&s;es with an innocent &s;atisfaction, the mind &s;till di&s;clo&s;es wonders in them, which ravi&s;h its faculties.</P>
<P>When we have carefully &s;urveyed the &s;tructure of a flower, we always find one or more inclo&s;ures appointed for the reception of the &s;eed: around that inclo&s;ure is a &s;et of chives &s;u&s;taining &s;everal packets of powder, which they &s;catter on all parts. The whole is encompa&s;&s;ed with an empalement, or &s;oft robe, that unfolds and enclo&s;es, with a kind of precaution, according to the di&s;po&s;ition of the air. All the&s;e things convince us, that the&s;e parts, which are di&s;po&s;ed with &s;o much art and regularity, and wither round the enclo&s;ure, when the &s;eed is formed, are in&s;trumental in the generation of the &s;eed. We are like|wi&s;e convinced of the original de&s;ign of flowers: the Al|mighty, by di&s;pen&s;ing the verdure of the earth to man|kind, has perpetuated his gifts through all ages, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="61" REF="035911_0031_1007BF1FCD69BB28">
of the commi&s;&s;ion he has given to flowers to renew each plant from year to year, by infu&s;ing fertility into the &s;eed.</P>
<P>This important and fir&s;t de&s;ign to procure immortality to plants, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;econd, which is to de|light the view of man. When God created the flower, he thought fit to blend utility with plea&s;ure. If he had on|ly appointed them to furni&s;h each plant with a reproduc|tive &s;eed, he would not have graced the generality of them with &s;uch lovely forms and engaging colours; but they would have re&s;embled roots, which, being only cal|culated to impart nouri&s;hment to the plant in a &s;ituation of ob&s;curity, were not provided with any embelli&s;hment: whereas that great Being, who formed the flowers, &s;eems to have taken plea&s;ure to &s;hape and paint the greate&s;t part of them in &s;uch a manner, as qualifies them to re|gale the view of man, and adorn his habitation. It is difficult to conceive how far the de&s;ign to delight man with the beauty and profu&s;ion of flowers has been extended. They rear their heads on the lofty tops of trees, and are diffu&s;ed through the herbage that creeps along the earth; they embelli&s;h the vallies and the mountains, and the meadows are enamelled with their colours; they are gathered from the &s;kirts of woods, and make their appearance even in de&s;erts: the earth is a garden entirely covered with their bloom.</P>
<P>The beauty of flowers never fails to in&s;pire us with joy; &s;culpture imitates them in its &s;ofte&s;t ornaments; architec|ture be&s;tows the embelli&s;hment of leaves and fe&s;toons, on tho&s;e columns and fronts, which would otherwi&s;e be too naked. The riche&s;t embroideries are little more than foliage and flowers; the mo&s;t magnificent &s;ilks are al|mo&s;t covered with the&s;e charming forms, and are thought beautiful, in proportion as they re&s;emble the lively tinge of natural flowers.</P>
<P>The fe&s;tivals in the country are never celebrated with|out garlands, and the entertainments of the polite are u&s;h|ered in with flowers: a young bride, in all the magnifi|cence of her nuptial array, would imagine &s;he wanted a nece&s;&s;ary part of her ornaments, if &s;he did not improve them by a &s;prig of flowers: a queen, amid&s;t the greate&s;t

<P>We may, indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, con&s;ider it as a mi&s;|fortune, that we &s;hould ever be deprived of the view of beautiful flowers. But, alas! what more is the beau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of our fair readers, than the emblem of a &s;hort-lived flower.</P>
<LG>
<L>The faire&s;t forms that nature &s;hows</L>
<L>Su&s;tain the &s;horte&s;t doom:</L>
<L>Beauty is like the morning ro&s;e,</L>
<L>That withers in its bloom.</L>
</LG>
<P>If the Divine Wi&s;dom &s;eems to have had complacency in the di&s;tribution of tho&s;e colours that array the flowers, what a new charm has it imparted to them in their partic|ular airs and forms! We ob&s;erve &s;ome ri&s;ing with a mei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of dignity and grandeur, while others, without the lea&s;t pomp or o&s;tentation, attract the eye by the regularity of their lineaments. What an a&s;pect of maje&s;ty is vi&s;ible in the growth of tulips! how elegant is the &s;ymmetry of tho&s;e pyramids, in which the lilies appear!</P>
<P>Flowers are not only intended to beautify the earth with their brilliant colours; but the greate&s;t part of them, in order to render the entertainment more exqui&s;ite, dif|fu&s;e a fragrance, that perfumes all the air around us; and it &s;hould &s;eem as if they were &s;olicitous to re&s;erve their odours for the evening and morn, when walking is mo&s;t agreeable; but their &s;weets are very faint during the heat of the day, when we vi&s;it them lea&s;t.</P>
<P>To conclude&mdash;even flowers furni&s;h us with in&s;truction, and conduct us, by gentle &s;teps, to the knowledge of the Fir&s;t Being, who has thus conde&s;cended to &s;hape and paint them with &s;o much delicacy, and to grace them with &s;uch a variety of beauties. How amiable mu&s;t he then be, who is the &s;ource of &s;o many charms in &s;uch an infin|ity of objects, to whom he con&s;tantly imparts the &s;ame lu&s;tre they di&s;clo&s;ed, when they fir&s;t appeared on the earth! and, if he has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow &s;o magnificent an array on creatures of &s;uch a tran&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent duration, and who

<HEAD>THE FEMALE CHOICE.&mdash;A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG girl, having fatigued her&s;elf one hot day, with running about the garden, &s;at her&s;elf down in a plea&s;ant arbour, where &s;he pre&s;ently fell a&s;leep. Dur|ing her &s;lumber, two female figures pre&s;ented them&s;elves before her. One was loo&s;ely habited in a thin robe of pink, with light green trimmings. Her &s;a&s;h of &s;ilver gauze flowed to the ground. Her fair hair fell in ringlets down her neck; and her head-dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of artificial flowers interwoven with feathers. She held in one hand a ball-ticket, and in the other a fancy-dre&s;s all covered with &s;pangles and knots of gay ribbon. She advanced &s;miling to the girl, and, with a familiar air, thus addre&s;&s;|ed her:&mdash;</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Meli&s;&s;a, I am a kind genius, who have watched you from your birth, and have joyfully beheld all your beauties expand, till at length they have render|ed you a companion worthy of me. See what I have brought you. This dre&s;s and this ticket will give you free acce&s;s to all the ravi&s;hing delights of my palace. With me you will pa&s;s your days in a perpetual round of ever varying amu&s;ements. Like the gay butterfly, you will have no other bu&s;ine&s;s than to flutter from flower to flow|er, and &s;pread your charms before admiring &s;pectators. No re&s;traints, no toils, no dull ta&s;ks, are to be found with|in my happy domains. All is plea&s;ure, life and good humour. Come then, my dear! Let me put on you this dre&s;s, which will make you quite enchanting; and away, away, with me!</P>
<P>Meli&s;&s;a felt a &s;trong inclination to comply with the call of this inviting nymph; but fir&s;t &s;he thought it would be prudent at lea&s;t to a&s;k her name. My name, &s;aid &s;he, is Di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>The other female then advanced. She was clothed in a clo&s;e habit of brown &s;tuff, &s;imply relieved with white. She wore her &s;mooth hair under a plain cap. Her whole per&s;on was perfectly neat and clean. Her look was &s;e|rious, but &s;atisfied; and her air was &s;taid and compo&s;ed.
<PB N="65" REF="035911_0033_1007BF25C6388F50">
She held in one hand a di&s;taff; on the oppo&s;ite arm hung a work-ba&s;ket; and the girdle round her wai&s;t was gar|ni&s;hed with &s;ci&s;&s;ars, knitting-needles, reels, and other im|plements of female labour. A bunch of keys hung at her &s;ide. She thus acco&s;ted the &s;leeping girl:&mdash;</P>
<P>Meli&s;&s;a, I am the genius who have ever been the friend and companion of your mother; and I now offer my protection to you. I have no allurements to tempt you with like tho&s;e of my gay rival. In&s;tead of &s;pending all your time in amu&s;ements, if you enter your&s;elf of my train, you mu&s;t ri&s;e early, and pa&s;s the long day in a va|riety of employments, &s;ome of them difficult, &s;ome la|borious, and all requiring &s;ome exertion of body or mind. You mu&s;t dre&s;s plainly, live mo&s;tly at home, and aim at being u&s;eful rather than &s;hining. But, in return, I will in&s;ure you content, even &s;pirits, &s;elf-approbation, and the e&s;teem of all who thoroughly know you. If the&s;e offers appear to your young mind le&s;s inviting than tho&s;e of my rival, be a&s;&s;ured, however, that they are more real. She has promi&s;ed much more than &s;he can ever make good. Perpetual plea&s;ures are no more in the power of Di&s;&s;ipation, than of Vice or Folly, to be&s;tow. Her delights quickly pall, and are inevitably &s;ucceeded by languor and di&s;gu&s;t. She appears to you under a di&s;gui&s;e, and what you &s;ee is not her real face. For my&s;elf, I &s;hall never &s;eem to you le&s;s amiable than I now do; but, on the contrary, you will like me better and better. If I look grave to you now, you will hear me &s;ing at my work; and when work is over, I can dance too. But I have &s;aid enough: it is time for you to choo&s;e whom you will follow; and upon that choice all your happine&s;s depends. If you would know my name, it is Hou&s;e|wifery.</P>
<P>Meli&s;&s;a heard her with more attention than delight; and though overawed by her manner, &s;he could not help turning again to take another look at the fir&s;t &s;peaker. She beheld her &s;till offering her pre&s;ents with &s;o bewitch|ing an air, that &s;he felt it &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t; when, by a lucky accident, the ma&s;k with which Di&s;&s;ipation's face was &s;o artfully covered, fell off.

There, a &s;maller number, almo&s;t equally gay in dre&s;s, were entering an elegant meeting-hou&s;e. Up one alley, a Roman Catholic con|gregation was turning into their retired chapel, every one cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with a finger dipt in holy water as he went in. The oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet was covered with a train of Quakers, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their plain and neat attire, and &s;edate a&s;pect, who walked without cere|mony into a room as plain as them&s;elves, and took their &s;eats, the men on one &s;ide, and the women on the other, in &s;ilence. A &s;pacious building was filled with an over-flowing crowd of Methodi&s;ts, mo&s;t of them meanly hab|ited, but decent and &s;erious in demeanour; while a &s;mall &s;ociety of Bapti&s;ts in the neighbourhood, quietly occu|pied their humble place of a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently the different &s;ervices began. The churches re&s;ounded with the &s;olemn organ, and with the indi&s;tinct murmurs of a large body of people following the mini&s;|ter in re&s;pon&s;ive prayers. From the meetings were heard the &s;low p&s;alm, and the &s;ingle voice of the leader of their devotions. The Roman Catholic chapel was enlivened by &s;trains of mu&s;ic, the tinkling of a &s;mall bell, and a per|petual change of &s;ervice and ceremonial. A profound &s;ilence and unvarying look and po&s;ture announced the &s;elf-recollection and mental devotion of the Quakers.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="035911_0034_1007BF27AE0CA688">Mr. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> led his &s;on <HI>Edwin</HI> round all the&s;e different a&s;&s;emblies as a &s;pectator. Edwin viewed every thing with great attention, and was often impatient to inquire of his father the meaning of what he &s;aw: but Mr. Ambro&s;e would not &s;uffer him to di&s;turb any of the congregations, even by a whi&s;per. When they had gone through the whole, Edwin found a great number of que&s;tions to put to his father, who explained every thing to him in the be&s;t manner he could. At length, &s;ays Edwin&mdash;But why cannot all the&s;e people agree to go to the &s;ame place, and wor&s;hip God the &s;ame way?</P>
<P>And why &s;hould they agree? (replied his father.) Do you not &s;ee that people differ in a hundred other things? Do they all dre&s;s alike, and eat and drink alike, and keep the &s;ame hours, and u&s;e the &s;ame diver&s;ions?</P>
<P>Ay! but tho&s;e are things in which they have a right to do as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>And they have a right, too, to wor&s;hip God as they plea&s;e. It is their own bu&s;ine&s;s, and concerns none but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But has not God ordered particular ways of wor&s;hip|ing him?</P>
<P>He has directed the mind and &s;pirit with which he is to be wor&s;hipped, but not the particular form and man|ner. That is left for every one to choo&s;e, according as &s;uits his temper and opinions. All the&s;e people like their own way be&s;t, and why &s;hould they leave it for the choice of another? Religion is one of the things in which <HI>man|kind were made to differ.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everal congregations now began to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the &s;treet was again over&s;pread with per&s;ons of all the different &s;ects, going promi&s;cuou&s;ly to their re&s;pective homes. It chanced that a poor man fell down in the &s;treet in a fit of apoplexy, and lay for dead. His wife and children &s;tood round him crying and lamenting in the bittere&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. The beholders immediately flock|ed round, and, with looks and expre&s;&s;ions of the warm|e&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, gave their help. A Churchman rai&s;ed the man from the ground, by lifting him under the arms, while a Di&s;&s;enter held his head, and wiped his face with his handkerchief. A Roman Catholic lady took out her

<HEAD>THE FOUR SISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>I AM one of four Si&s;ters; and having &s;ome rea&s;on to think my&s;elf not well u&s;ed either by them or by the world, I beg leave to lay before you a &s;ketch of our hi&s;tory and characters. You will not wonder there &s;hould be frequent bickerings among&s;t us, when I tell you that in our infancy we were continually fighting; and &s;o great was the noi&s;e, and din, and confu&s;ion, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our continual &s;truggles to get uppermo&s;t, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for any body to live among&s;t us, in &s;uch a &s;cene of tumult and di&s;order. The&s;e brawls, however, by a powerful interpo&s;ition, were put an end to; our proper place was a&s;&s;igned to each of us, and we had &s;trict orders not to encroach on the limits of each other's property, but to join our common offices for the good of the whole family.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t &s;i&s;ter (I call her the fir&s;t, becau&s;e we have generally allowed her the precedence in rank,) is, I mu&s;t acknowledge, of a very active &s;prightly di&s;po&s;ition; quick and lively, and has more brilliancy than any of us: but &s;he is hot: every thing &s;erves for fuel to her fury, when it is once rai&s;ed to a certain degree; and &s;he is &s;o mi&s;|chievous whenever &s;he gets the upper hand, that, not|with&s;tanding her a&s;piring di&s;po&s;ition, if I may freely &s;peak my mind, &s;he is calculated to make a good &s;ervant, but a very bad mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to mention, that notwith&s;tanding her &s;eeming delicacy, &s;he has a mo&s;t voracious appetite, and devours every thing that comes in her way; though,
<PB N="69" REF="035911_0035_1007BF2A5C3B66D8">
like other eager thin people, &s;he does no credit to her keeping. Many a time has &s;he con&s;umed the product of my barns and &s;tore-hou&s;es, but it is all lo&s;t upon her. She has even been known to get into an oil-&s;hop or tallow-chandler's, when every body was a&s;leep, and lick up, with the utmo&s;t greedine&s;s, whatever &s;he found there. Indeed, all prudent people are aware of her tricks, and though &s;he is admitted into the be&s;t families, they take care to watch her very narrowly. I &s;hould not forget to mention, that my &s;i&s;ter was once in a country where &s;he was treated with uncommon re&s;pect; &s;he was lodged in a &s;umptuous building, and had a number of young wo|men of the be&s;t families to attend on her, and feed her, and watch over her health; in &s;hort, &s;he was looked up|on as &s;omething more than a common mortal. But &s;he always behaved with great &s;everity to her maids, and if any of them were negligent of their duty, or made a &s;lip in their own conduct, nothing would &s;erve her but bury|ing the poor girls alive. I have, my&s;elf, had &s;ome dark hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and intimations, from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authori|ty, that &s;he will &s;ome time or other make an end of me. You need not wonder, therefore, if I am jealous of her motions.</P>
<P>The next &s;i&s;ter I &s;hall mention to you, has &s;o far the appearance of mode&s;ty and humility, that &s;he generally &s;eeks the lowe&s;t place. She is indeed of a very yielding ea&s;y temper, generally cool, and often wears a &s;weet placid &s;mile upon her countenance; but &s;he is ea&s;ily ruf|fled, and when worked up, as &s;he often is, &s;he becomes a perfect fury. Indeed &s;he is &s;o apt to &s;well with &s;udden gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he is &s;u&s;pected at times to be a lit|tle lunatic. Between her and my fir&s;t mentioned &s;i&s;ter, there is a more &s;ettled antipathy than between the The|ban pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and they never meet without making efforts to de&s;troy one another. With me &s;he is always ready to form the mo&s;t intimate union, but it is not always to my advantage. There goes a &s;tory in our family, that when we were all young, &s;he once attempted to drown me. She actually kept me under a con&s;iderable time, and though at length I got my head above water, my con&s;ti|tution is generally thought to have been e&s;&s;entially in|jured
<PB N="70" REF="035911_0036_1007BF2D1DE0B650">
by it ever &s;ince. From that time &s;he has made no &s;uch atrocious attempt, but &s;he is continually making encroachments upon my property; and even when &s;he appears mo&s;t gentle, &s;he is very in&s;idious, and has &s;uch an undermining way with her, that her in&s;inuating ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> are as much to be dreaded as open violence. I might indeed remon&s;trate; but it is a known part of her charac|ter, that nothing makes any la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion upon her.</P>
<P>As to my third &s;i&s;ter, I have already mentioned the in offices &s;he does me with my la&s;t mentioned one, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> entirely under her influence. She is be&s;ides of a very uncertain variable temper, &s;ometimes hot, and &s;ometimes cold, nobody knows where to have her. Her lightne&s;s is even proverbial, and &s;he has nothing to give tho&s;e who live with her more &s;ub&s;tantial than the &s;miles of courtier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I mu&s;t add, that &s;he keeps in her &s;ervice three or four rough blu&s;tering bullies with puffed cheeks, who, when they are let loo&s;e, think they have nothing to do but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> drive the world before them. She &s;ometimes joins with my &s;i&s;ter, and their violence occa&s;ionally throws me into &s;uch a trembling, that though naturally of a firm con&s;ti|tution, I &s;hake as if I was in an ague fit.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I am of a &s;teady &s;olid temper; not &s;hin|ing indeed, but kind and liberal, quite as lady Bountiful Every one ta&s;tes of my beneficence; and I am of &s;o grate|ful a di&s;po&s;ition, that I have been known to return <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hundred fold for any pre&s;ent that has been made me. I feed and clothe all my children, and afford a welcome home to the wretch who has no other home. I bear with unrepining patience all manner of ill u&s;age; I am trampled upon, I am torn and wounded by the mo&s;t cutting &s;trokes; I am pillaged of the trea&s;ures hidden in my mo&s;t &s;ecret chambers; notwith&s;tanding which, I am always ready to return good for evil, and am contin|ually &s;ub&s;ervient to the plea&s;ure or advantage of others; yet, &s;o ungrateful is the world, that becau&s;e I do not po&s;|&s;e&s;s all the airine&s;s and activity of my &s;i&s;ters, I am &s;tig|matized as dull and heavy. Every &s;ordid mi&s;erly fellow is called by way of deri&s;ion one of my children; and if a per&s;on, on entering a room, does but turn his eyes upon me, he is thought &s;tupid and mean, and not fit for good

company. I have the &s;atisfaction, however, of finding that people always incline towards me as they grow older; and that tho&s;e, who &s;eemed proudly to di&s;dain any affin|ity with me, are content to &s;ink at la&s;t into my bo&s;om. You will probably wi&s;h to have &s;ome account of my per|&s;on. I am not a regular beauty; &s;ome of my features are rather har&s;h and prominent, when viewed &s;eparately; but my countenance has &s;o much variety of expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o many different attitudes of elegance, that tho&s;e who &s;tudy my face with attention, find out continually new charms; and it may be truly &s;aid of me, what Titus &s;ays of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and for a much longer &s;pace:

liking to the little orphan, the Doctor took her home to his hou&s;e, notwith&s;tanding he had a numerous family of his own. Here her company and opportunities for im|provement were better, and her deportment &s;uch, that &s;he became equally e&s;teemed by the Doctor, his wife and children: her &s;teady, diligent, and careful attention to all their dome&s;tic concerns ingratiated her &s;o much with the Doctor and his wife, that they made no di&s;tinction be|tween her and their own children. She ever after &s;how|ed her acknowledgment with the utmo&s;t gratitude, in richly providing for all tho&s;e, who could lay claim to any alliance with the Doctor's family; nor did &s;he forget her fir&s;t benefactor, the clerk of Runghen. In this happy &s;ituation &s;he grew up to woman, when a Livonian &s;er|jeant, in the Swedi&s;h &s;ervice, fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her; &s;he likewi&s;e liking him, agreed to marry him, provided it could be done with the Doctor's con&s;ent; who, upon inquiry into the man's character, finding it unexceptionable, readily gave it. The marriage day was appointed, and indeed, came; when a &s;udden order came to the &s;erjeant that very morning, to march direct|ly with a detachment for Riga. Soon after this, General Baur, at the head of an army, came before the town and took it, in the year 1742, when all the inhabitants were made pri&s;oners, and among&s;t the re&s;t this lovely bride.

<HEAD>STORY OF A VIRTUOUS YOUNG LADY.</HEAD>
<P>DURING my re&s;idence in Mo&s;cow, I was told the following particulars of the Czar. He was born in the year 1672, and was married in 1690, at the age of eighteen, to Ottoke&s;&s;a Lupochin, a beggar's daughter, by whom he had Prince Alexis. Some time after, he turned her away, and &s;hut her up in a mona&s;tery, on &s;u&s;picion of di&s;loyalty to his bed. After the divorce, one Mi&s;s Mons, a very beautiful young lady, born at Mo&s;|cow of foreign parents, was much in favour with the Czar; but when he was abroad, Mr. Key&s;erling, then re&s;ident at. Mo&s;cow, as Envoy from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, paid his addre&s;&s;es to, and married her.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="035911_0038_1007BF32378F4FF8">The Czar was &s;ometime after &s;mitten with the charms of another beautiful young lady, the daughter of a for|eign merchant in this city: he fir&s;t &s;aw her at her fa|ther's hou&s;e, where he dined one day. He was &s;o much taken with her appearance, that he offered her any terms &s;he plea&s;ed, if &s;he would live with him, which this virtuous young woman mode&s;tly refu&s;ed; but, dreading the effects of his authority, &s;he put on a re&s;olution, and left Mo&s;cow in the night, without communicating her de&s;ign even to her parents. Having provided a little money for her &s;upport, &s;he travelled on foot &s;everal miles into the coun|try, till &s;he arrived at a &s;mall village, where her nur&s;e lived with her hu&s;band and their daughter, the young lady's fo&s;ter &s;i&s;ter, to whom &s;he di&s;covered her intention of concealing her&s;elf in a wood near that village: and to prevent any di&s;covery, &s;he &s;et out the &s;ame night, accom|panied by the hu&s;band and daughter. The hu&s;band be|ing a timber man by trade, and well acquainted with the wood, conducted her to a little dry &s;pot in the middle of a mora&s;s, and there he built a hut for her habitation. She had depo&s;ited her money with her nur&s;e to procure little nece&s;&s;aries for her &s;upport, which were faithfully conveyed to her at night, by the nur&s;e or her daughter, by one of whom &s;he was con&s;tantly attended in the night time.</P>
<P>The next day after her flight, the Czar called at her father's to &s;ee her; and, finding the parents in anxious concern for their daughter, and him&s;elf di&s;appointed, fancied it a plan of their own concerting. He became angry, and began to threaten them with the effects of his di&s;plea&s;ure, if &s;he was not produced: nothing was left to the parents but the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations, with tears of real &s;orrow running down their cheeks, to con|vince him of their innocence, and ignorance what was be|come of her; a&s;&s;uring him of their fears that &s;ome fatal di&s;a&s;ter had befallen her, as nothing belonging to her was mi&s;&s;ing, except what &s;he had on at the time. The Czar, &s;atisfied of their &s;incerity, ordered great &s;earch to be made for her, with the offer of a con&s;iderable reward to the per&s;on who &s;hould di&s;cover what was become of her; but to no purpo&s;e. The parents and relations, ap|prehending
<PB N="75" REF="035911_0038_1007BF32378F4FF8">
&s;he was no more, went into mourning for her.</P>
<P>Above a year after this, &s;he was di&s;covered by accident. A Colonel, who had come from the army to &s;ee his friends, going a hunting into that wood, and following his game, through the mora&s;s, he came to the hut, and looking into it, &s;aw a pretty young woman in a mean dre&s;s. After inquiring of her who &s;he was, and how &s;he came to live in &s;o &s;olitary a place, he found out at la&s;t that &s;he was the lady who&s;e di&s;appearance had made &s;o great a noi&s;e. In the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and with the mo&s;t fervent entreaties, &s;he prayed him, on her knees, that he would not betray her. To which he replied, that he thought her danger was now pa&s;t, as the Czar was then otherways engaged; and that &s;he might with &s;afety di&s;cover her&s;elf, at lea&s;t to her parents, with whom he would con&s;uit how matters &s;hould be managed. The lady agreed to his propo&s;al; and he &s;at out immediately, and overjoyed her parents with the happy di&s;covery. The i&s;&s;ue of their delibera|tions was to con&s;ult Madam Catharine (as &s;he was then called) in what manner the affair &s;hould be opened to the Czar. The Colonel went al&s;o upon this bu&s;ine&s;s, and was advi&s;ed by Madam to come next morning, and &s;he would introduce him to his Maje&s;ty, when he might make the di&s;covery, and claim the promi&s;ed reward. He went according to appointment; and, being introduced, told the accident by which he had di&s;covered the lady, and repre&s;ented the mi&s;erable &s;ituation in which he found her, and what &s;he mu&s;t have &s;uffered by being &s;o long &s;hut up in &s;uch a di&s;mal place, from the delicacy of her &s;ex. The Czar &s;hewed a great deal of concern that he &s;hould have been the cau&s;e of all her &s;ufferings, declaring that he would endeavour to make her amends. Here Madam Catharine &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;he thought the be&s;t amends his Maje&s;ty could make, was to give her a hand|&s;ome fortune, and the Colonel for a hu&s;band, who had the be&s;t right, having caught her in pur&s;uit of his game. The Czar, agreeing perfectly with Madam Catharine's &s;entiments, ordered one of his favourites to go with the Colonel, and bring the young lady home; where &s;he ar|rived, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of her family and relations,

<P>SOME years ago, while profe&s;&s;or Krahe was &s;uperintendant of the gal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of paintings, he received a vi&s;it from a young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er of the town; who, after a &s;hort introduction, took a book out of his pocket, which he pre&s;ented to Mr. Krahe, expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire that he would purcha&s;e it. The &s;uperintendant found, upon examina|tion, that it was a prayer-book, ornamented in the an|cient &s;tyle of religious foppery, with a number of colour|ed figures and engravings. It was the one which the Elector Clement Augu&s;tus, of Cologne, had ordered to be publi&s;hed, and was become very &s;carce and valuable. The profe&s;&s;or inquired whence he had it? and the young man an&s;wered with a mode&s;t blu&s;h, that it was a copy from one he had borrowed. "By whom?" "By my&s;elf," rejoins the youth. Upon a clo&s;e examination, Mr. Krahe could &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;h the copy from the original. He could not conceal his &s;urpri&s;e, and a&s;ked why he did not practi&s;e engraving, rather than continue a baker? The youth an&s;wered, that it was the wi&s;h of his &s;oul; but his father having a numerous family, could not afford the expen&s;e of &s;uitable in&s;tructions. "I de&s;ign to travel," adds he; "but as my father cannot furni&s;h the means, and as I knew that you was fond of drawings, I was emboldened to make this application to you, in hopes that you would purcha&s;e the copy, to furni&s;h im|mediate

help, and I mu&s;t tru&s;t to my indu&s;try and good fortune for future advancement."</P>
<P>"Call here to-morrow, without fail," &s;ays Mr. Krahe, with an empha&s;is that manife&s;ted plea&s;ure and a&s;toni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, the profe&s;&s;or called upon an intimate friend at Key&s;er&s;worth, a few miles from Du&s;&s;el|dorff, of which place the young man was a native.</P>
<P>This friend, with the power, had the di&s;po&s;ition to do good. Krahe told him the &s;tory, &s;hewed him the work|man&s;hip, and begged him to lend the young arti&s;t two hundred crowns. "He will, doubtle&s;s," adds he, "be|come, in a few years, a di&s;tingui&s;hed engraver, and be able to reimbur&s;e you. I will be &s;ecurity for the pay|ment."</P>
<P>"I take no &s;ecurity," an&s;wered his friend; and he ad|vanced three hundred crowns.</P>
<P>Krahe returned to the a&s;toni&s;hed and tran&s;ported ba|ker with the money. He quitted the oven, learned ge|ometry and per&s;pective, applied to drawing according to the rules of the art, and acquired a competent knowledge of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>After a&s;&s;iduous application, for the &s;pace of two years, the young man had made &s;uch rapid progre&s;s, that Mr. Krahe advi&s;ed him to quit Du&s;&s;eldorff, where no further improvement was to be expected, and vi&s;it Paris, promi&s;|ing him a letter of introduction to Mr. Willes, a celebrat|ed engraver in that metropolis.</P>
<P>Smith (for this was the young man's name) put his advice into execution; and, in order to economize his little &s;tore, he travelled on foot from Du&s;&s;eldorff to Paris. But unfortunately, he fell ill immediately upon his arriv|al; and, although he applied to a mona&s;tery, where he was ho&s;pitably received, and carefully attended, yet inci|dental expen&s;es, during an illne&s;s of &s;ome continuance, had entirely exhau&s;ted his little &s;tore. Upon his recov|ery, that delicate kind of pride, which &s;o frequently ac|companies true genius, forbade his making application to Mr. Willes, while he mu&s;t appear an indigent beggar.</P>
<P>One day, as he was walking, pen&s;ively in the &s;treets, his mind occupied with his unfortunate &s;ituation, he was
<PB N="78" REF="035911_0040_1007BF378EFFD030">
met by two &s;oldiers of the Swi&s;s guards; one of whom acco&s;ted him with the inquiry, "Young man, are you not a German?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"From whence?"&mdash;"From Key&s;er&s;worth, near Du&s;&s;eldorff."&mdash;"You are my country|man.&mdash;What do you do here?" Smith related to him the particulars of his hi&s;tory; adding, that a long illne&s;s had exhau&s;ted a large portion of his time, and all his money; and that he could not &s;upport the idea of being trouble&s;ome to any one. The &s;oldiers advi&s;ed him to enli&s;t, a&s;&s;uring him that the &s;ervice was not &s;evere, and that he would have lei&s;ure to follow the bent of his ge|nius. Smith accepted the propo&s;ition, was introduced to the captain of the regiment, was enli&s;ted for four years, and &s;hortly after was introduced to Mr. Willes, by the captain him&s;elf. As much time was indulged to him, as the nature of the &s;ervice could po&s;&s;ibly admit, to pur|&s;ue his favourite object, under Mr. Willes. He continu|ed in this &s;ituation the four years, when he received his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Finding that he was in the line of improvement, he continued at Paris two years longer, applying him&s;elf, with the utmo&s;t diligence, to the art of engraving: at the expiration of which term, he returned home, with the be&s;t atte&s;tations concerning his talents, indu&s;try, and moral conduct.</P>
<P>Profe&s;&s;or Krahe received him with open arms, was charmed with the progre&s;s he had made, and engaged him to work in the cabinet. He continued to work un|der the in&s;pection of the profe&s;&s;or, about two years, con|ducting him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, as to gain upon the af|fections of his patron.</P>
<P>It was about this period, that the profe&s;&s;or invited our arti&s;t to an entertainment, where &s;everal of his friends were to be pre&s;ent. He met his friends, and was enter|ing into the joys of convivial conver&s;ation, when he was informed that the entertainment was in honour of a &s;tran|ger. But alas! this &s;tranger was the de&s;tined hu&s;band of the profe&s;&s;or's elde&s;t daughter;&mdash;beautiful, in his eyes as an angel; and wi&s;e, in his judgment, as the godde&s;s of wi&s;dom. He made as precipitate a retreat as decency
<PB N="79" REF="035911_0040_1007BF378EFFD030">
would permit, and left the bri&s;k gla&s;s and jovial &s;ong to circulate among the happy.</P>
<P>The next morning he returned to the cabinet with the utmo&s;t dejection of mind and countenance. This &s;ud|den change was noticed by his benefactor, who inquired into the cau&s;e. Smith, in confu&s;ed expre&s;&s;ions, and with faultering voice, confe&s;&s;ed that he had fallen deeply in love with that very daughter who was &s;hortly to be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another.</P>
<P>"Have you intimated to my daughter the &s;trength of your affections?"</P>
<P>"Never," an&s;wered the noble youth; "not in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner. Could I, without title, fortune, or pre|ten&s;ions of any kind, be &s;o ba&s;e as to &s;peak of love to the daughter of my friend, my patron, my benefactor? I was contented to &s;ee her, and was careful to conduct my&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that no &s;u&s;picions might ari&s;e, to debar me of that happine&s;s; and now I learn, that I am &s;hortly to be deprived of the only &s;atisfaction to which I dared to a&s;pire."</P>
<P>The benevolent profe&s;&s;or tried his utmo&s;t to &s;oothe and comfort him; a&s;&s;ured him of the &s;trength of his affection; that he loved him as his own child: but warned him to &s;ubdue his love for Henrietra; expatiating upon the crim|inality, circum&s;tanced as they were, of indulging the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The poor young man admitted the force of the argu|ment, and promi&s;ed to obey. But the &s;truggle was too much for his con&s;titution. He fell ill, and continued in a dangerous &s;tate upwards of four months. Mr. Krahe paid him every attention, and gave him every con&s;olation in his power. But, in all their interviews, the name of Henrietta was never mentioned. His lamentable &s;itua|tion, however, could not be concealed from her. She &s;ympathized with, and mo&s;t &s;incerely pitied him; but, though "pity is &s;o near a-kin to love," duty and honour interpo&s;ed a barrier between them.</P>
<P>The intended hu&s;band returned to his parents; and it was not difficult to perceive, from the tenor of his let|ters, that certain objections were &s;tarted by them to the union. Although he dared not to expre&s;s his own &s;enti|ments
<PB N="80" REF="035911_0041_1007BF39F3CD8150">
fully upon this occa&s;ion, yet Henrietta divined the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and gave him full power to follow the genuine bent of his own inclinations, renouncing every claim upon his prom|i&s;e. The an&s;wer was corre&s;pondent to her expectations; and, allowing a &s;hort interval for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chagrin, which the injured pride of every young lady mu&s;t &s;uffer in &s;uch delicate &s;ituations, &s;he permitted the &s;ufferings of Smith to engage more of her thoughts, gen|erou&s;ly indulged her compa&s;&s;ion, until &s;he found it blend|ed with affection; and, finally, addre&s;&s;ed her father thus: "Sir, I know it has been your wi&s;h to have Smith for your &s;on-in-law&mdash;every ob&s;tacle is removed. Tell him that Henrietta will be his, if &s;he can promote his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+licity."</P>
<P>The joyful father informed him of this declaration in his favour: But the good news was as like to have proved fatal as his de&s;pair. Recovering from his emotion, and leaning on the arm of his benefactor, he was conducted to the generous object of his pa&s;&s;ion; and, by pa&s;&s;ing the evening in her company, he was cheered, comforted, and re&s;tored.</P>
<P>But how great was the &s;urpri&s;e of every one, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they learned, the next morning, that the lover had l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the town, in a carriage with four hor&s;es, and had carried his plates and drawings with him!&mdash;What a&s;toni&s;hment to Krahe!&mdash;What a thunder&s;troke to poor Henrietta&punc;</P>
<P>This was &s;o apparently the act of a di&s;ordered brain, that his return was dreaded as much as his flight was lamented. Nor did they receive a &s;ingle line in the in|terval, to remove their doubts. On the ninth day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e returned from Munich, with an order for a pen&s;ion of &s;ix hundred florins per annum, to be paid to Smith by the trea&s;urer of the palatinate.</P>
<P>He had been to throw him&s;elf at the feet of the Elector Palatine. He di&s;covered to him his love, his &s;ituation; &s;hewed him the certificates of his conduct, and the &s;peci|mens of his workman&s;hip. The heart of the Elector was moved, and he gave him the pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Now, Sir," &s;aid the generous hearted Smith, "I am more worthy of my Henrietta."</P>

With great capacity for bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he was un&s;ucce&s;sful in affairs. Infinitely amiable in her private deportment, &s;he enjoyed not tranquillity and happine&s;s. She was candid and open, engaging and generous. Her manners were gen|tle, her temper cheerful, her conver&s;ation ea&s;y and flow|ing,
<PB N="83" REF="035911_0042_1007BF3BC5A7FB98">
her wit polite, her information various, her ta&s;te elegant. But her hu&s;bands, like her courtiers, were ea|ger to interrupt her pro&s;perity and enjoyments; and while her admini&s;tration was deformed with di&s;a&s;ters and faction, her dome&s;tic life was embittered with di&s;quietudes and &s;orrow. With every claim to felicity, &s;he was expo&s;ed to all the cro&s;&s;es of fortune; and her form, which gave a &s;plendour to her rank, her abilities, her virtues, and her accompli&s;hments, &s;erved to ennoble her afflictions. The incomparable beauty and expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, the exqui&s;ite propriety of her &s;tature, and the exact &s;ym|metry of her &s;hape, attracted and fixed the admiration of every beholder. In her air, her walk; her ge&s;ture, &s;he mingled maje&s;ty and grace. Her eyes, which were of a dark grey, &s;poke the &s;ituations and &s;en&s;ibility of her mind; the &s;ound of her voice was melodious and affect|ing; and her hair, which was black, improved the bright|ne&s;s of her complexion. To give the greate&s;t lu&s;tre to her per&s;on, &s;he took a full advantage of the adventitious aids of dre&s;s. She di&s;covered an inexhau&s;tible fancy in the richne&s;s and variety of her garments. She delight|ed in jewels and precious &s;tones; and &s;he was anxiou&s;ly curious in the finene&s;s and fa&s;hion of her linen. But while her mind and her per&s;on were &s;o perfect and &s;o al|luring, &s;he was not exempted from frailties. Though capable of di&s;&s;imulation, and acquainted with the arts of management and addre&s;s, &s;he did not &s;ufficiently accom|modate her&s;elf to the manners of her people. Her re|&s;pect for her religion was too fond and doating, to con&s;i&s;t with the policy and the dignity of a great &s;overeign. In her coun&s;ellors &s;he uniformly repo&s;ed too unbounded a confidence; and from the &s;oftne&s;s of her nature, &s;he could be &s;educed to give them her tru&s;t even after their demea|nour was equivocal and &s;u&s;picious. Her clemency was not guided by prudence, and was generally repaid with ingratitude and in&s;ult. To the prote&s;tant clergy, who&s;e in&s;olence was inordinate and &s;editious, &s;he conducted her|&s;elf, &s;ometimes with a pa&s;&s;ion that was unbecoming, and &s;ometimes with a remi&s;&s;ne&s;s that detracted from her con|&s;equence. A determined contempt or a vigorous &s;everity would have &s;uited better with her royal condition. She
<PB N="84" REF="035911_0043_1007BF3D52990450">
received her impre&s;&s;ions with too much vivacity; and from the delicacy of her organization, &s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to that &s;pirit of caprice which is in &s;ome mea&s;ure character|i&s;tic of her &s;ex; but which, though often plea&s;ant and de|lightful in the &s;till and endearing intercour&s;e of private life, betrays in public concerns the &s;u&s;picion of incon&s;tancy and indi&s;cretion. Her faults, however, were the re&s;ult of amiable weakne&s;&s;es; and they excite regret rather than indignation. The mo&s;t unpardonable error of her life, was the romantic imprudence with which &s;he ventured into England, and entru&s;ted her&s;elf to the power of Elizabeth. By courage and per&s;everance &s;he might have defeated the turbulence and ambition of her nobles; and experi|ence and time would have opened to her all the arts of government. But by this fatal &s;tep &s;he involved her&s;elf in difficulties which &s;he was never able to &s;urmount. Eliz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|abeth, to whom her abilities and beauty were a &s;ource of the mo&s;t unrelenting jealou&s;y and anger, embraced with a ferocious ardour the opportunity of humbling her com|pletely as a Queen and as a woman. She was expo&s;ed to all the practices of a cunning and a wicked vengeance. The vile&s;t calumnies, the mo&s;t in&s;ulting mortifications, the mo&s;t &s;tudied barbarities, were practi&s;ed again&s;t her. She was made to exchange a kingdom for a pri&s;on! An inclement and &s;u&s;picious adver&s;ary, who dreaded to encounter her when at liberty, tarni&s;hed the glory of an illu&s;trious reign by trampling upon her &s;ceptre, while &s;he was a captive. The rival&s;hip of beauty, &s;till more per|haps than of talents, &s;oftered the re&s;entments of Elizabeth; and while &s;he made Mary to &s;uffer under her power, &s;he found the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delight in overturning the do|minion of her charms. It plea&s;ed her, to the greate&s;t degree, that the beauty of the Scotti&s;h Prince&s;s &s;hould wa&s;te it&s;elf in &s;olitude; that &s;he &s;hould be kept at a di&s;|tance from admiration and homage; and that &s;he &s;hould never experience, in any fortunate alliance, the melting tenderne&s;s, and the delicate &s;en&s;ibilities of connubial love. During the long period, which pa&s;&s;ed from the flight of Mary into England till her death, her mi&s;eries were in|ten&s;e, piercing and uninterrupted. The bitter cup of her fortune, which often overflowed, never cea&s;ed to be

full. But though agonizing with con&s;tant afflictions, and though crowned with thorns, &s;he &s;till remembered that &s;he was a Queen, and maintained the elevation and the dignity, which became her. To overwhelm her with di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h, Elizabeth &s;crupled not to in&s;ult and to violate the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of law and ju&s;tice, the honour of ho&s;pitality, the reverence of her &s;ex, the holine&s;s of religion, the &s;olemnity of engage|ments, the ties of relation, the feelings of humanity, the &s;anctity of innocence, and the maje&s;ty of Kings. But no in&s;olence of tyranny, no refinement of anger, and no pang of woe could conquer or de&s;troy her greatne&s;s and her fortitude. Her mind, which grew in its powers un|der &s;truggles and calamity, &s;eemed even to take a &s;train of vigour from the atrocious pa&s;&s;ions of her rival; and during her lamentable captivity, and in her dying &s;cene, &s;he di&s;played a magnanimity and a heroi&s;m, that per|haps may have been equalled, but which has never been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in any age, or in any nation.</P>

Nevil, the daughter of a brave and accompli&s;hed officer, who, clo&s;ing a laborious and painful life in very indi|gent circum&s;tances, had left his unfortunate child to the care of his maiden &s;i&s;ter. The aunt of Amelia was &s;uch an old maid as might alone &s;uffice to re&s;cue the &s;i&s;ter|hood from ridicule and contempt. She had been at|tached, in her early days, to a gallant youth, who un|happily lo&s;t his own life in pre&s;erving that of his dear friend, her brother: &s;he devoted her&s;elf to his memory with the mo&s;t tender, unaffected, and invariable attach|ment; refu&s;ing &s;everal advantageous offers of marriage, though her income was &s;o narrow, that nece&s;&s;ity obliged her to convert her whole fortune into an annuity, ju&s;t before the calamitous event happened, which made her the only guardian of the poor Amelia. This lovely but unfortunate girl was turned of fourteen on the death of her father. She found, in the hou&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter, the mo&s;t friendly a&s;ylum, and a relation, who&s;e heart and mind made her mo&s;t able and willing to form the char|acter of this engaging orphan, who appeared to be as highly favoured by nature as &s;he was per&s;ecuted by for|tune. The beauty of Amelia was &s;o &s;triking, and the charms of her lively under&s;tanding began to di&s;play them&s;elves in &s;o enchanting a manner, that her affection|ate aunt could not bear the idea of placing her in any lower order of life: &s;he gave her the education of a gen|tlewoman, in the flattering and generous hope that her various attractions mu&s;t &s;upply the ab&s;olute want of for|tune, and that &s;he &s;hould enjoy the delight of &s;eeing her dear Amelia &s;ettled happily in marriage, before her death expo&s;ed her lovely ward to that poverty, which was her only inheritance. Heaven di&s;po&s;ed it otherwi&s;e. This amiable woman, after having acted the part of a mo&s;t affectionate parent to her indigent niece, died be|fore Amelia attained the age of twenty. The poor girl was now apparently de&s;titute of every re&s;ource, and ex|po&s;ed to penury, with a heart bleeding for the lo&s;s of a mo&s;t indulgent protector. A widow lady of her ac|quaintance very kindly afforded her a refuge in the fir&s;t moments of her di&s;tre&s;s, and propo&s;ed to two of her op|ulent friends, that Amelia &s;hould re&s;ide with them by
<PB N="87" REF="035911_0044_1007BF40DFA65B20">
turns, dividing her year between them, and pa&s;&s;ing four months with each. As &s;oon as Mrs. Wormwood was informed of this event, as &s;he delighted in tho&s;e o&s;tenta|tious acts of apparent beneficence, which are fal&s;ely call|ed charity, &s;he de&s;ired to be admitted among the volun|tary guardians of the poor Amelia. To this propo&s;al all the parties a&s;&s;ented; and it was &s;ettled that Amelia &s;hould pa&s;s the la&s;t quarter of every year, as long as &s;he remained &s;ingle, under the roof of Mrs. Wormwood. This lovely orphan had a &s;en&s;ibility of heart, which ren|dered her extremely grateful for the protection &s;he re|ceived, but which made her &s;everely feel all the mi&s;eries of her dependence. Her beauty attracted a multitude of admirers, many of whom, pre&s;uming on her poverty, treated her with a licentious levity, which always wound|ed her ingenuous pride. Her per&s;on, her mind, her man|ners, were univer&s;ally commended by the men; but no one thought of making her his wife. "Amelia," they cried, "is an enchanting creature; but who in the&s;e times, can afford to marry a pretty, proud girl, &s;upported by charity?" Though this prudential que&s;tion was never uttered in the pre&s;ence of Amelia, &s;he began to perceive its influence, and &s;uffered the painful dread of proving a perpetual burden to tho&s;e friends, by who&s;e genero&s;ity &s;he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted: &s;he wi&s;hed a thou&s;and times that her af|fectionate aunt, in&s;tead of cultivating her mind with &s;uch dangerous refinement, had placed her in any &s;tation of life, where &s;he might have maintained her&s;elf by her own manual labour: &s;he &s;ometimes entertained a project of making &s;ome attempt for this purpo&s;e; and &s;he once thought of changing her name, and of trying to &s;upport her&s;elf as an actre&s;s on one of the public theatres; but this idea, which her hone&s;t pride had &s;ugge&s;ted, was ef|fectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by her mode&s;ty; and &s;he continued to wa&s;te the mo&s;t precious time of her youth, under the mortification of perpetually wi&s;hing to change her mode of life, and of not knowing how to effect it. Almo&s;t two years had now elap&s;ed &s;ince the death of her aunt; and, without any pro&s;pect of marriage, &s;he was in her &s;econd period of re&s;idence with Mrs. Wormwood. Amelia's under&s;tanding was by no means inferior to her other en|dowments.
<PB N="88" REF="035911_0045_1007BF435766B900">
She began to penetrate all the artful di&s;gui&s;e, and to gain a perfect and very painful in&s;ight into the re|al character of her pre&s;ent ho&s;te&s;s. This lady had re|marked, that when Mi&s;s Nevil re&s;ided with her, her hou&s;e was much more frequented by gentlemen than at any other &s;ea&s;on. This, indeed, was true; and it unluckily happened that the&s;e vi&s;itors often forgot to applaud the &s;mart &s;ayings of Mrs. Wormwood, in contemplating the &s;weet countenance of Amelia; a circum&s;tance fully &s;uf|ficient to awaken, in the neglected wit, the mo&s;t bitter en|vy, hatred and malice. In truth, Mrs. Wormwood de|te&s;ted her lovely gue&s;t, with the mo&s;t implacable viru|lence; but &s;he had the &s;ingular art of di&s;gui&s;ing her de|te&s;tation in the language of flattery: &s;he under&s;tood the truth of Pope's maxim,
<Q>"He hurts me mo&s;t who lavi&s;hly commends;"</Q>
and &s;he therefore made u&s;e of lavi&s;h commendation as an in&s;trument of malevolence towards Amelia; &s;he in&s;ulted the ta&s;te, and ridiculed the choice, of every new-married man, and declared her&s;elf convinced, that he was a fool, becau&s;e he had not cho&s;en that mo&s;t lovely young wo|man. To more than one gentleman &s;he &s;aid, you mu&s;t marry Amelia; and, as few men choo&s;e to be driven into wedlock, &s;ome offers were po&s;&s;ibly prevented by the treach|erous vehemence of her prai&s;e. Her malice, however, was not &s;ufficiently gratified by ob&s;erving that Amelia had no pro&s;pect of marriage. To indulge her malignity, &s;he re&s;olved to amu&s;e this unhappy girl with the hopes of &s;uch an event, and then to turn, on a &s;udden, all the&s;e &s;plendid hopes into mockery and delu&s;ion. Accident led her to pitch on Mr. Nel&s;on, as a per&s;on who&s;e name &s;he might, with the greate&s;t &s;afety, employ as the in&s;trument of her in&s;idious de&s;ign, and with the greater chance of &s;ucce&s;s, as &s;he ob&s;erved that Amelia had conceived for him a particular regard.</P>
<P>Mr. Nel&s;on was a gentleman, who, having met with very &s;ingular events, had contracted a great but very a|miable &s;ingularity of character. He was placed, early in life, in a very lucrative commercial &s;ituation, and was on the point of &s;ettling happily in marriage with a very beautiful young lady, when the hou&s;e in which &s;he re&s;id|ed
<PB N="89" REF="035911_0045_1007BF435766B900">
was con&s;umed by fire. Great part of her family, and among them the de&s;tined bride, was buried in the ruins. Mr. Nel&s;on, in lo&s;ing the object of his ardent affection, by &s;o &s;udden a calamity, lo&s;t for &s;ome time the u&s;e of his rea&s;on; and when his health and &s;en&s;es returned, he &s;till continued under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the profounde&s;t melancholy, till his fond devotion to the memory of her, whom he had lo&s;t in &s;o &s;evere a manner, &s;ugge&s;ted to his fancy a &s;ingular plan of benevolence, in the pro&s;ecution of which he recovered a great portion of his former &s;pi|rits. This plan con&s;i&s;ted in &s;earching for female objects of charity, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es had been occa&s;ioned by fire. As his fortune was very ample, and his own private ex|pen&s;es very moderate, he was able to relieve many unfor|tunate per&s;ons in this condition; and his affectionate imagination delighted it&s;elf with the idea, that in the&s;e uncommon acts of beneficence, he was guided by the influence of that lovely angel who&s;e mortal beauty had peri&s;hed in the flames!</P>
<P>Mr. Nel&s;on frequently vi&s;ited a married &s;i&s;ter who was &s;ettled in the town where Mrs. Wormwood re&s;ided. There was al&s;o, in the &s;ame town, an amiable elderly widow, for whom he had a particular e&s;teem. This lady, who&s;e name was Melford, had been left in very &s;canty circum&s;tances on the death of her hu&s;band, and, re&s;iding at that time in London, &s;he had been involved in additional di&s;tre&s;s by that calamity to which the atten|tive charity of Mr. Nel&s;on was forever directed: he more than repaired the lo&s;s which &s;he &s;u&s;tained by fire, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in &s;ettling her in the neighbourhood of his &s;i&s;ter. Mrs. Melford had been intimate with the aunt of Amelia, and was &s;till the mo&s;t valuable friend of that lovely or|phan, who paid her frequent vi&s;its, though &s;he never re|&s;ided under her roof. Mr. Nel&s;on had often &s;een Ame|lia at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Melford, which led him to treat her with particular politene&s;s, whenever he vi&s;ited Mrs. Wormwood; a circum&s;tance on which the latter founded her ungenerous project. She perfectly knew all the &s;in|gular private hi&s;tory of Mr. Nel&s;on, and firmly believed, like all the re&s;t of his acquaintance, that no attractions could ever tempt him to marry; but &s;he thought it po&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="90" REF="035911_0046_100792ED808F8630">
to make Amelia conceive the hope that her beauty had melted his re&s;olution; and nothing &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, could more effectually mortify her gue&s;t, than to find her&s;elf de|rided for &s;o vain an expectation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wormwood began, therefore, to in&s;inuate, in the mo&s;t artful manner, that Mr. Nel&s;on was very particu|lar in his civilities to Amelia; magnified all his amiable qualities, and expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in the pro&s;|pect of &s;o delightful a match. The&s;e petty artifices, how|ever, had no effect on the natural mode&s;ty and diffidence of Amelia: &s;he &s;aw nothing that authori&s;ed &s;uch an idea in the u&s;ual politene&s;s of a well-bred man of thirty-&s;even; &s;he pitied the misfortune, &s;he admired the elegant and engaging, though &s;erious manners, and &s;he revered the virtues of Mr. Nel&s;on; but, &s;uppo&s;ing his mind to be en|tirely engro&s;&s;ed, as it really was, by his &s;ingular charita|ble pur&s;uits, &s;he entertained not a thought of engaging his affection. Mrs. Wormwood was determined to play off her favourite engine of malignity, a counterfeited letter. She had acquired in her youth, the very dangerous talent of forging any hand that &s;he plea&s;ed; and her pa&s;&s;ion for mi&s;chief had afforded her much practice in this treacherous art. Having previou&s;ly and &s;ecretly engaged Mr. Nel&s;on to drink tea with her, &s;he wrote a billet to Amelia, in the name of that gentleman, and with the mo&s;t perfect imi|tation of his hand. The billet &s;aid, that he de&s;igned him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing that afternoon at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wormwood, and reque&s;ted the favour of a pri|vate conference with Mi&s;s Nevil, in the cour&s;e of the ev|ening; intimating, in the mo&s;t delicate and doubtful terms, an ardent de&s;ire of becoming her hu&s;band. Mrs. Wormwood contrived that Amelia &s;hould not &s;ee the bil|let till ju&s;t before dinner-time, that &s;he might not &s;hew it to her friend and confidant, Mrs. Melford, and by her means detect its fallacy before the hour of humiliation arrived.</P>
<P>Amelia blu&s;hed in reading the note, and, in the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e of un&s;u&s;pecting innocence, gave it to the vigilant Mrs. Wormwood, who bur&s;t into vehement expre&s;&s;ions of delight, congratulated her blu&s;hing gue&s;t on the full &s;uc|ce&s;s of her charms, and triumphed in her own prophetic
<PB N="91" REF="035911_0046_100792ED808F8630">
di&s;cernment. They &s;at down to dinner, but poor Ame|lia could hardly &s;wallow a mor&s;el; her mind was in a tumultuous agitation of plea&s;ure and amazement. The malicious impo&s;tor, enjoying her confu&s;ion, allowed her no time to compo&s;e her hurried &s;pirits in the &s;olitude of her chamber. Some female vi&s;itors arrived to tea; and at length Mr. Nel&s;on entered the room. Amelia trem|bled and blu&s;hed as he approached her: but &s;he was a little relieved from her embara&s;&s;ment by the bu&s;ine&s;s of the tea-table, over which &s;he pre&s;ided. Amelia was nat|urally graceful in every thing &s;he did; but the pre&s;ent agitation of her mind gave a temporary awkwardne&s;s to all her motions: &s;he committed many little blunders in the management of the tea-table; a cup fell from her trembling hand, and was broken; but the politene&s;s of Mr. Nel&s;on led him to &s;ay &s;o many kind and graceful things to her on the&s;e petty incidents, that, in&s;tead of in|crea&s;ing her di&s;tre&s;s, they produced an oppo&s;ite effect, and the tumult of her bo&s;om gradually &s;ub&s;ided into a calm and compo&s;ed delight. She ventured to meet the eyes of Mr. Nel&s;on, and thought them expre&s;&s;ive of that ten|derne&s;s, which promi&s;ed a happy end to all her misfor|tunes. At the idea of exchanging mi&s;ery and dependence for comfort and honour, as the wife of &s;o amiable a man, her heart expanded with the mo&s;t innocent and grateful joy. This appeared in her countenance, and gave &s;uch an exqui&s;ite radiance to all her features, that &s;he looked a thou&s;and times more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Worm|wood &s;aw this improvement of her charms, and, &s;icken|ing at the &s;ight, determined to reduce the &s;plendor of &s;uch in&s;ufferable beauty, and ha&s;tily terminate the tri|umph of her deluded gue&s;t. She began with a few ma|licious and &s;arca&s;tic remarks on the vanity of beautiful young women, and the hopes which they frequently en|tertain of an imaginary lover; but, finding the&s;e remarks produced not the effect &s;he intended, &s;he took an oppor|tunity of whi&s;pering in the ear of Amelia, and begged her not to harbour any vain expectations; for the billet &s;he had received was a counterfeit, and a mere piece of plea&s;antry. Amelia &s;huddered and turned pale: &s;ur|pri&s;e, di&s;appointment, and indignation, con&s;pired to over|whelm
<PB N="92" REF="035911_0047_1007BF47DC426000">
her. She exerted her utmo&s;t power to conceal her emotions; but the conflict in her bo&s;om was too violent to be di&s;gui&s;ed. The tears, which &s;he vainly endeavour|ed to &s;uppre&s;s, bur&s;t forth, and &s;he was obliged to quit the room in very vi&s;ible di&s;order. Mr. Nel&s;on expre&s;&s;ed his concern; but he was checked in his benevolent in|quiries by the caution of Mrs. Wormwood, who &s;aid, on the occa&s;ion, that Mi&s;s Nevil was a very amiable girl, but &s;he had &s;ome peculiarities of temper, and was apt to put a wrong con&s;truction on the innocent plea&s;antry of her friends. Mr. Nel&s;on ob&s;erving that Amelia did not return, and hoping that his departure might re&s;tore the interrupted harmony of the hou&s;e, took an early leave of Mrs. Wormwood, who immediately flew to the chamber of Amelia, to exult like a fiend over that lovely victim of her &s;ucce&s;sful malignity. She found not the per&s;on whom &s;he was &s;o eager to in&s;ult. Amelia had indeed retired to her chamber, and pa&s;&s;ed there a very mi&s;erable half hour, much hurt by the treacherous cruelty of Mrs. Wormwood, and &s;till more wounded by reflections on her own credulity, which &s;he condemned with that exce&s;s of &s;everity &s;o natural to a delicate mind in arraigning it&s;elf. She would have flown for immediate con&s;olation to her friend, Mrs. Melford; but &s;he had rea&s;on to believe that lady engaged on a vi&s;it; and &s;he therefore re&s;olved to take a &s;olitary walk for the purpo&s;e of compo&s;ing her &s;pirits: but neither &s;olitude nor exerci&s;e could re&s;tore her tranquillity; and, as it grew towards evening, &s;he ha&s;ten|ed to Mrs. Melford's, in hopes of now finding her re|turned.</P>
<P>Her worthy old confidant was indeed in her little par|lour alone, when Amelia entered the room. The eyes of this lovely girl immediately betrayed her di&s;tre&s;s; and the old lady with her u&s;ual tenderne&s;s exclaimed, "Good Heaven! my dear child, for what have you been crying?" "Becau&s;e," replied Amelia in a broken voice, and bur&s;t|ing into a fre&s;h &s;hower of tears, "becau&s;e I am a fool." Mrs. Melford began to be mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed; and, expre&s;&s;ing her maternal &s;olicitude in the kinde&s;t manner, Amelia produced the fatal paper. "There," &s;ays &s;he, "is a letter in the name of your excellent friend, Mr. Nel&s;on;
<PB N="93" REF="035911_0047_1007BF47DC426000">
it is a forgery of Mrs. Wormwood's, and I have been &s;uch an idiot as to believe it real." The affectionate Mrs. Melford, who, in her fir&s;t alarm, had apprehended a much heavier calamity, was her&s;elf greatly comforted in di&s;covering the truth, and &s;aid many kind things to con&s;ole her young friend. "Do not fancy," replied Ame|lia, "that I am fooli&s;hly in love with Mr. Nel&s;on, though I think him the mo&s;t plea&s;ing as well as the mo&s;t excel|lent of men; and though I confe&s;s to you, that I &s;hould certainly think it a ble&s;&s;ed lot to find a refuge from the mi&s;ery of my pre&s;ent dependance, in the arms of &s;o gen|erous and &s;o benevolent a protector." "Tho&s;e arms are now open to receive you," &s;aid a voice that was heard be|fore the &s;peaker appeared. Amelia &s;tarted at the &s;ound, and her &s;urpri&s;e was not a little increa&s;ed in &s;eeing Mr. Nel&s;on him&s;elf, who, entering the room from an adjoin|ing apartment, embraced the lovely orphan in a tran&s;|port of tenderne&s;s and delight. Amelia, alive to all the feelings of genuine mode&s;ty, was for &s;ome minutes more painfully di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this &s;urpri&s;e, than &s;he had been by her pa&s;t mortification: &s;he was ready to &s;ink into the earth, at the idea of having betrayed her &s;ecret to a man, from whom &s;he would have laboured mo&s;t to conceal it. In the fir&s;t tumult of this delicate confu&s;ion, &s;he &s;inks into a chair, hides her face in her hankerchief. Nel&s;on, with a mixture of re&s;pect and love, being afraid of increa&s;ing her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;eizes one of her hands, and continues to ki&s;s it without uttering a word. The good Mrs. Melford, al|mo&s;t as much a&s;toni&s;hed, but le&s;s painfully confu&s;ed than Amelia, beholds this unexpected &s;cene, with that kind of joy, which is much more di&s;po&s;ed to weep than to &s;peak: and, while this little party is thus ab&s;orbed in &s;ilence, let me ha&s;ten to relate the incidents which produced their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Mr. Nel&s;on had ob&s;erved the &s;arca&s;tic manner of Mrs. Wormwood towards Amelia; and, as &s;oon as he had end|ed his uncomfortable vi&s;it, he ha&s;tened to the worthy Mrs. Melford, to give her &s;ome little account of what had pa&s;&s;|ed, and to concert with her &s;ome happier plan for the &s;up|port of this amiable, in&s;ulted orphan. "I am acquaint|ed, &s;aid he, with &s;ome brave and wealthy officers, who
<PB N="94" REF="035911_0048_1007BF4A59CD9740">
have &s;erved with the father of Mi&s;s Nevil, and often &s;peak of him with re&s;pect; I am &s;ure I can rai&s;e among them a &s;ub&s;cription for the maintenance of this tender, unfortu|nate girl: we will procure for her an annuity, that &s;hall enable her to e&s;cape from &s;uch malignant patronage, to have a little home of her own, and to &s;upport a &s;ervant." Mrs. Melford was tran&s;ported at this idea; and, recol|lecting all her own obligations to this benevolent man, wept, and extolled his genero&s;ity; and, &s;uddenly &s;eeing Amelia at &s;ome di&s;tance, through a bow window, which commanded the &s;treet in which &s;he lived, "Thank Heav|en, &s;he cried, here comes my poor child, to hear and ble&s;s you for the extent of your goodne&s;s." Nel&s;on, who de|lighted mo&s;t in doing good by &s;tealth, immediately ex|torted from the good old lady a promi&s;e of &s;ecre&s;y: it was the be&s;t part of his plan, that Amelia &s;hould never know the per&s;ons, to whom &s;he was to owe her independ|ence. "I am &s;till afraid of you, my worthy old friend, &s;aid Nel&s;on; your countenance or manner will, I know betray me, if Mi&s;s Nevil &s;ees me here to-night."&mdash;"Well, &s;aid the delighted old lady, I will humour your delicacy; Amelia will probably not &s;tay with me ten minutes; you may amu&s;e your&s;elf, for that time, in my &s;pacious gar|den: I will not &s;ay you are here; and, as &s;oon as the good girl returns home, I will come and impart to you the particulars of her recent vexation."&mdash;"Admirably &s;ettled," cried Nel&s;on; and he immediately retreated in|to a little back room, which led through a gla&s;s door in|to a long &s;lip of ground, embelli&s;hed with the &s;weete&s;t and lea&s;t expen&s;ive flowers, which afforded a favourite occupation and amu&s;ement to Mrs. Melford. Nel&s;on, after taken a few turns in this diminutive garden, find|ing him&s;elf rather chilled by the air of the evening, re|treated again into the little room he had pa&s;&s;ed, intend|ing to wait there till Amelia departed; but the partition between the parlours being extremely &s;light, he overheard the tender confe&s;&s;ion of Amelia, and was hurried towards her by an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, in the manner already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melford was the fir&s;t who recovered from the kind of trance into which our little party had been thrown by
<PB N="95" REF="035911_0048_1007BF4A59CD9740">
their general &s;urpri&s;e; and &s;he enabled the tender pair, in the pro&s;pect of who&s;e union her warm heart exulted, to regain that ea&s;y and joyous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their faculties, which they lo&s;t for &s;ome little time in their mutual em|barra&s;&s;ment. The applau&s;e of her friend, and the ado|ration of her lover, &s;oon taught the diffident Amelia to think le&s;s &s;everely of her&s;elf. The warm-hearted Mrs. Melford declared that the&s;e occurrences were the work of Heaven. "That (replied the affectionate Nel&s;on) I am mo&s;t willing to allow; but you mu&s;t grant that Heaven has produced our pre&s;ent happine&s;s, by the blind agency of a fiend; and, as our dear Amelia has too gentle a &s;pirit to rejoice in beholding the malignity of a devil converted into the torment of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, I mu&s;t beg that &s;he may not return, even for a &s;ingle night, to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wormwood." Amelia pleaded her &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t obligations, and wi&s;hed to take a peaceful leave of her patrone&s;s; but &s;he &s;ubmitted to the ardent entreaties of Nel&s;on, and remained for a few weeks under the roof of Mrs. Melford, when &s;he was united at the altar to the man of her heart. Nel&s;on had the double delight of rewarding the affection of an angel, and of puni&s;hing the malevolence of a fiend: he announced in per&s;on to Mrs. Wormwood his intended marriage with Amelia, on the very night when that treacherous old maid had amu&s;ed her&s;elf with the hope of deriding her gue&s;t; who&s;e return &s;he was eagerly expecting, in the moment Nel&s;on arrived to &s;ay, that Amelia would re|turn no more.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e and mortification of Mrs. Wormwood aro&s;e almo&s;t to frenzy: &s;he racked her malicious and in|ventive brain for expedients to defeat the match, and cir|culated a report for that purpo&s;e, which decency will not allow me to explain. Her artifice was detected and de&s;pi&s;ed. Amelia was not only married, but the mo&s;t admired, the mo&s;t beloved, and the happie&s;t of human beings; an event which preyed &s;o ince&s;&s;antly on the &s;pirit of Mrs. Wormwood, that &s;he fell into a rapid decline, and ended, in a few months, her mi&s;chievous and unhap|py life; a memorable example, that the mo&s;t artful ma|lignity may &s;ometimes procure for the object of its envy, that very happine&s;s which it labours to prevent!</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF MELETINA.</HEAD>
<P>MELETINA is the accompli&s;hed daughter of opulent parents. Her mother died when &s;he was very young. Her father, a man of feeling and liberal mind, devoted him&s;elf entirely to the education of his two love|ly children, Meletina and her brother, who, being nearly of an age, and equal in all the be&s;t gifts of nature, grew up together in the tendere&s;t affection. It happened that Meletina, now turned of twenty, was on a di&s;tant vi&s;it, at the hou&s;e of a female relation, when &s;he heard that her father, whom &s;he loved mo&s;t tenderly, was attacked by a very dangerous di&s;order. The poor girl ha&s;tened home in the mo&s;t painful anxiety, which was converted into the bit|tere&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, by her finding, on her return, that her father was dead, and her brother confined by the malignant di&s;|temper, which he had caught in his ince&s;&s;ant attendance on the parent they had lo&s;t. The utmo&s;t efforts were u&s;ed to keep Meletina from the chamber of her brother; but no entreaties could prevail on her to de&s;ert the only &s;urviving object of her ardent affection; and, de&s;pi&s;ing the idea of her own danger, &s;he attended the unhappy youth, who was now delirious, with &s;uch tender a&s;&s;iduity, that &s;he would not permit him to receive either nouri&s;h|ment or medicine from any hand but her own. The pu|rity of her con&s;titution, or the immediate care of Provi|dence, pre&s;erved the generous Meletina from infection, and Heaven granted to her earne&s;t prayers the endanger|ed life of her brother; but his recovery &s;eemed rather de&s;igned as a trial of her fortitude than as a reward of her tenderne&s;s: his bodily health was re&s;tored to him, but his mental faculties were de&s;troyed. The unhappy Meletina, in the place of a lively young friend and a gen|erous protector, found only a poor babbling idiot, who&s;e &s;ituation appeared to her the more deplorable, becau&s;e, though he had utterly lo&s;t a &s;olid and a brilliant under|&s;tanding, he &s;eemed to retain all his benevolent affec|tions. By one peculiarity which attended him, &s;he was
<PB N="97" REF="035911_0049_1007BF4C46CB0F38">
&s;ingularly affected; and perhaps it made her re&s;olve on the extraordinary &s;acrifice which &s;he has offered to his calamity. The peculiarity I &s;peak of was this; he not only di&s;covered grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;atisfaction in the &s;ight of his &s;i&s;ter, though utterly unable to maintain a rational conver&s;ation with her, but if &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eft him for any con&s;iderable time, he began to expre&s;s, by many wild ge&s;tures, extreme agi|tation and anxiety, and could never be prevailed on to touch any food, except in the pre&s;ence of Meletina. Many experiments were tried to quiet his apprehen&s;ions on this point, and to relieve his &s;i&s;ter from &s;o inconve|nient and &s;o painful an attendance. The&s;e experiments did not &s;ucceed; but two medical friends of Meletina, who took a generous intere&s;t in her health and happine&s;s, engaged to correct this peculiarity in her poor &s;en&s;ele&s;s brother, and convinced her that for his &s;ake, as well as for her own, &s;he ought to acquie&s;ce in &s;ome painful expe|dients for this purpo&s;e. Her under&s;tanding was indeed convinced by their humane and judicious arguments, but her heart &s;oon revolted again&s;t them; and, after two or three &s;evere but un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to correct the ob&s;tinate habit of the affectionate idiot, &s;he determined to irritate him no further, but to make an entire &s;acrifice of her own convenience and plea&s;ure to the tranquillity of this unfortunate being. She felt a tender and melancholy delight in promoting his peace and comfort; but the time now arrived in which the force and purity of her &s;i&s;terly attachment was expo&s;ed to a trial perhaps as &s;evere as ever woman &s;u&s;tained. A year and &s;ome months had now elap&s;ed &s;ince the decea&s;e of her father, when a young &s;oldier, of family and fortune, who had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on her youthful heart, returned to England from a di&s;tant campaign. He was ju&s;t re|covered from a wound, which had detained him abroad, and returned home in the ardent hope of being com|pletely rewarded for all his toils and &s;ufferings, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his lovely Meletina. She received him with all the frankne&s;s and warmth of a &s;incere and vir|tuous affection: but, after they had given to each other a long and circum&s;tantial account of their pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;he an&s;wered his eager propo&s;al of immediate marriage
<PB N="98" REF="035911_0050_1007BF502F517AC8">
by declaring, that &s;he thought it her duty to renou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her fair pro&s;pect of connubial happine&s;s, and to devote her&s;elf entirely to that unfortunate brother, who exi&s;ted only by her ince&s;&s;ant attention: She enumerated the many rea&s;ons that inclined her to &s;uch a painful &s;acrifice, with all the &s;imple and pathetic eloquence of angelic vir|tue. Her lover, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that melting tenderne&s;s of heart which often accompanies heroic courage, li&s;ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to all her arguments with a &s;ilent though pa&s;&s;ionate admiration; and, in&s;tead of attempting to detach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thoughts from the deplorable condition of her brother, he offered to relinqui&s;h his own active pur&s;uits, to engage with her in any plan of &s;eque&s;tered life, and to take an equal part in the &s;uperintendance of that haple&s;s being who had &s;o ju&s;t a title to their compa&s;&s;ion and their ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. This generous offer overwhelmed the tender Meletina&punc; For &s;ome time &s;he could an&s;wer it only by weeping; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they were tears of mingled agony and delight. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> la&s;t &s;he replied, "My excellent friend, I &s;hall now, and at all times, have the frankne&s;s to avow, that you are extremely dear to me, and that I feel, as I ought to do the uncommon proof which you are now giving me of the pure&s;t affection; but I mu&s;t not &s;uffer the kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity of your heart to injure your happine&s;s and glory. I mu&s;t not be your wife. The peculiarity of my &s;ituation calls for &s;o painful a &s;acrifice; but great &s;acrifices have great rewards. I feel that I &s;hall be &s;up|ported by the noble pride, not only of di&s;charging my duty, but of pre&s;erving your tender e&s;teem, which I &s;hould certainly de&s;erve to forfeit, as well as my own, if I did not re&s;olutely decline your too generous propo&s;al." The affectionate young &s;oldier endeavoured to &s;hake her re&s;o|lution, by every argument that the truth and ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t. Meletina was inflexi|ble; and the utmo&s;t that her lover could obtain, was a promi&s;e, that if, by attention, and time, &s;he &s;ucceeded in her hope of re&s;toring the intellects of her brother, &s;he would complete the &s;cene of general happine&s;s, which that joyful event would occa&s;ion, by the immediate acceptance of that hand which &s;he now rejected only from the ju&s;t &s;cruples of genuine affection. Having thus &s;ettled their
<PB N="99" REF="035911_0050_1007BF502F517AC8">
very delicate conte&s;t, they parted. The &s;oldier rejoined his regiment; but, in &s;pite of military di&s;&s;ipation, continued for a long time to write very tender letters to the gener|ous Meletina. At la&s;t, however, whether his pa&s;&s;ion was dimini&s;hed by its de&s;pair of being gratified, or whether the purity of a cha&s;te attachment is incompatible with a martial life, while he was engaged in dangerous and di&s;|tant &s;ervice, he was deeply involved in a very perplexing illicit intrigue, which would probably have given him many years of di&s;quietude, had not the chance of war put an early period to his life. A mu&s;ket-ball pa&s;&s;ed through his body; but he lived long enough to write an affectionate parting letter to Meletina, in which he con|fe&s;&s;ed his frailties, extolled her angelic purity of heart, and entreated her to do what he &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured her he did him&s;elf&mdash;con&s;ider both the time and the manner of his death, not as a misfortune, but a ble&s;&s;ing. Meletina lamented him when dead, as &s;he had loved him living, with the mo&s;t faithful tenderne&s;s: &s;he mourned for him as for a hu&s;band; and though many years have elap&s;ed &s;ince his decea&s;e, a grey &s;ilk is to this day her con&s;tant apparel. Nor is there any o&s;tentation in this peculiarity of her dre&s;s; for her attendance on her brother is &s;till &s;o uniform, that &s;he never appears in public, and indeed is never ab&s;ent from her own hou&s;e more than two or three hours at a time. From habit, and the affectionate ca&s;t of her temper, &s;he takes a plea&s;ure in the petty childi&s;h plays by which her haple&s;s companion is amu&s;ed; and &s;o far from &s;inking her&s;elf into a &s;tate of indolence or apathy, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great delicacy of manners, and all the &s;trength and lu&s;tre of a refined under&s;tanding. She is now turned of fifty; and though her countenance when &s;he is &s;ilent, has an air of mild and touching mel|ancholy, her conver&s;ation is animated and cheerful. As her brother plea&s;es him&s;elf by the habit of ri&s;ing and go|ing to re&s;t with the lark, &s;he has the long winter evenings entirely to her&s;elf; and at this &s;ea&s;on &s;he has a great &s;hare of &s;ocial enjoyment, by receiving the vi&s;its of her &s;elected friends. To the&s;e &s;he is remarkably open and unre&s;erved, and has a peculiar plea&s;ure in talking over the extraordinary occurrences of her early life. This cir|cle
<PB N="100" REF="035911_0051_1007BFBDCDDE9D08">
indeed is &s;mall, though it is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed an hon|our to &s;hare the friend&s;hip of Meletina, and tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it have the happine&s;s of knowing perhaps the mo&s;t &s;ingular and mo&s;t intere&s;ting of ancient virgins.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF CASOS AND ITS INHABIT|ANTS.</HEAD>
<P>CASOS is one of the cyclades. It received its name from Ca&s;o, father of Cleomachus. This little i&s;land &s;ent a colony to Mount Ca&s;ius, dependent on Syri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; It is eighty &s;tadia [three leagues] in circumference; on it is a town of the &s;ame name, and round it &s;everal &s;maller i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The i&s;le of Ca&s;os has &s;uffered the common fate of the Archipelago. It is now &s;ubject to the Turks, but they dare not inhabit it, becau&s;e it has no fort. They would be afraid of being made pri&s;oners by the privateers of Malta, as has happened to them more than once at An|tiparos, and other places de&s;titute of fortre&s;&s;es. This fear is a mo&s;t fortunate circum&s;tance for the inhabitants, who owe to that alone, the tranquillity, happine&s;s, and liberty they enjoy.</P>
<P>The day after we ca&s;t anchor, I was impatient to go on &s;hore. The boat accordingly was launched, and we row<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> towards the rocks which &s;urrounded the i&s;land, but were at a lo&s;s where to land. Every part of the &s;hore was defended by dangerous &s;hoals, over which the foaming billows broke with great noi&s;e and violence. On whichever &s;ide we ca&s;t our eyes, Ca&s;os appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed inacce&s;&s;ible. At length one of the inhabitants, perceiv|ing our embarra&s;&s;ment, came down from the village, and pointed out to us, by waving his handkerchief, the place to which we &s;hould direct our cour&s;e. We reached the place, after coa&s;ting about a league along the i&s;land. The ground here becomes lower, and forms a valley, at the extremity of which a &s;mall ba&s;on has been dug for the reception of boats. The entrance is only twelve
<PB N="101" REF="035911_0051_1007BFBDCDDE9D08">
feet wide, and very difficult of acce&s;s, as it mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;|ed through exactly in the middle. If the boat &s;hould touch the &s;ides, which are &s;harp rocks, it would be in great danger of being da&s;hed to pieces. Add to this that, when we arrived before the entrance, a violent &s;well was ebbing out of it. The Ca&s;iot called one of his coun|trymen, and placing them&s;elves on each &s;ide, they made a &s;ign to us to pull &s;trong. As &s;oon as our boat had en|tered the dangerous pa&s;s, they guided it with long poles, to prevent it from &s;triking again&s;t the rocks, and thus conducted it into port. Through this pa&s;&s;age alone is it po&s;&s;ible to get on &s;hore in the i&s;land. The inhabitants might widen it if they cho&s;e; but they prefer leaving it thus dangerous, &s;ince, while it remains &s;o, they are un|der little apprehen&s;ion from their enemies.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;iot who had &s;hewn us the harbour politely in|vited us to go up to the village, and we followed him with plea&s;ure. I was dre&s;&s;ed in the French &s;tyle, with a &s;word, hat, and every other appurtenance of the dre&s;s of my nation. The news of the arrival of &s;trangers &s;oon &s;pread, and the women and children came out of their hou&s;es, and waited for us at the top of the hill. They &s;hew|ed a great deal of curio&s;ity, and examined us attentively. When we pa&s;&s;ed them, they all mode&s;tly ca&s;t down their eyes. Among the crowd there were &s;ome very hand|&s;ome. Several of them &s;aluted us, wi&s;hing us a good day, &s;aying, "You are welcome!" and we an&s;wered them with the u&s;ual ea&s;tern expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;"May the day be happy for you and for your gue&s;ts!"</P>
<P>The guide who conducted us was one of the principal inhabitants of the i&s;land. He pre&s;&s;ed me to &s;tep into his hou&s;e, and introduced me into a hall, which, though not magnificently furni&s;hed, was &s;ufficiently provided with every thing conducive to cleanline&s;s and convenience. Around it was a &s;ofa. He &s;eated me on a rai&s;ed bench, and placed him&s;elf below, while breakfa&s;t was preparing. Soon after, his wife and daughter appeared, with new-laid eggs, figs, and grapes. The girl blu&s;hed at &s;ight of a &s;tranger, who&s;e dre&s;s mu&s;t, no doubt, appear to her very extraordinary. Whil&s;t we were breakfa&s;ting with a good appetite, and my ho&s;t was pouring me out &s;ome
<PB N="102" REF="035911_0052_1007BF5505BC6A10">
excellent wine in a large gla&s;s, mo&s;t of the women of the village came to pay him a vi&s;it. They &s;aluted us, and &s;eated them&s;elves without ceremony around the apart|ment. They had been brought by curio&s;ity, and &s;oon began to whi&s;per one another, and make their remarks on the French dre&s;s. Europeans rarely land in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+itary i&s;land; and the inhabitants, accu&s;tomed to &s;ee noth+ing but bald heads, wrapped round with &s;hawls, long robes fa&s;tened with &s;a&s;hes, and venerable beards, could not but view with a&s;toni&s;hment a foreigner with lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> plaited hair, without mu&s;tachios, and wearing a cocked hat, and &s;hort coat that came no lower than his knee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. They appeared greatly &s;truck with the contra&s;t; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> half &s;mile, which was &s;ometimes vi&s;ible on their count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|nances, was not improbably a &s;ign they were employ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in making &s;atirical ob&s;ervations on the peculiarities of my habit, while I, on my &s;ide, was no le&s;s amu&s;ed with them. My attention was e&s;pecially engaged by two young fe|males, who would have been acknowledged to be hand+&s;ome, even in Paris.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t of the two had eyes full of fire, and fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> black eyebrows, equally arched. Her complexion was rather brown, but her features extremely animated. Her cheeks, delicately rounded, were every in&s;tant adorned with fre&s;h ro&s;es. Her delicate little mouth &s;eemed form|ed to &s;ay charming things. When &s;he &s;miled, teeth white as &s;now agreeably contra&s;ted the vermillion of her lips; and a mo&s;t enchanting vivacity animated her whole countenance, which &s;eemed to &s;parkle with wit and rep|artee. Her ebon locks, fa&s;tened (according to the man|ner of the country) to the crown of her head, fell negli|gently on a neck which &s;eemed of poli&s;hed ivory. A bodice without &s;leeves, opening a little towards the top&punc; afforded a glimp&s;e of the exact proportion of her beauti|ful &s;hape. A robe of the white&s;t and fine&s;t cotton, edg|ed with a purple border four fingers wide, and elegantly embroidered, de&s;cended to her feet, and her wai&s;t was loo&s;ely girded by a &s;a&s;h which floated around her.</P>
<P>The &s;econd di&s;puted with her the palm of beauty. Her &s;hape was more elegant, and her carriage more no|ble. Her eyes &s;hone with a &s;oft languor, and &s;eemed
<PB N="103" REF="035911_0052_1007BF5505BC6A10">
formed to in&s;pire love and delight, while her long eye|la&s;hes mode&s;tly lowered, concealed their &s;plendor, as if &s;he were afraid of betraying the &s;ecrets of her &s;oul. Her complexion was fairer; and her cheeks, le&s;s coloured, di&s;played the lily &s;lightly tinctured with the ro&s;e. Her features, though &s;carcely &s;o expre&s;&s;ive as tho&s;e of her companion, had more regularity, and were models of &s;ymmetry and ju&s;t proportion. At the fir&s;t glance &s;he but ju&s;t appeared what may be called hand&s;ome; but on more mature con&s;ideration, the perfection of the whole of her beauties enforced the highe&s;t admiration. The charms of the former in&s;pired a &s;udden joy, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to look on her without plea&s;ure: tho&s;e of the latter made le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion at the fir&s;t view; but, on ex|amination, an irre&s;i&s;tible attraction forced every heart of &s;en&s;ibility to pay her the &s;incere&s;t homage.</P>
<P>All the women, who honoured us with their pre&s;ence, were dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. They all wore the jacket, the &s;a&s;h, and the long robe of cotton. The only difference con&s;i&s;ted in the embroidery, which varied ac|cording to their different ta&s;tes, and in the manner of wearing their hair, which &s;ome of them &s;uffered to flow upon their &s;houlders in one or more tre&s;&s;es, while others fa&s;tened it to the crown of the head, letting it fall down again upon the neck. The two I have ju&s;t mentioned, were not the only ones who were hand&s;ome, but their beauty appeared to me the mo&s;t attractive.</P>
<P>You may po&s;&s;ibly imagine, madam, that, after the &s;ad &s;cenes to which I had been for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed, my imagination was inflamed at the &s;ight of the&s;e lovely fe|males, and that I have taken a plea&s;ure in embelli&s;hing them. That may indeed be the ca&s;e; but if it be, the illu&s;ion was of &s;ome duration. I pa&s;&s;ed eight days in the i&s;land, and would not wi&s;h to alter a &s;ingle feature in the portraits I have drawn. I have de&s;cribed what I &s;aw, and what I felt. I own to you, however, that my &s;urpri&s;e was equal to my plea&s;ure. I expected to find, on this rock, only mi&s;erable &s;laves, groaning under the oppre&s;&s;ions of the Turks; in&s;tead of which, I met with a cheerful and happy people, who were fortunate enough to be able to pre&s;erve their liberty amid the de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny with which they are &s;urrounded.</P>

The men dined together, &s;eated in a circle on the carpet, and the women in a &s;eparate apartment.

to it. Towards the end of the meal, the cup was circulated from hand to hand. The company drank to me, wi&s;hing me a pro&s;perous voyage, and I returned the compliment, by drinking health and happine&s;s to the people of Ca&s;os.

The uniform dre&s;s of the&s;e nymphs, the mode&s;ty which heightened their charms, their becoming ba&s;hfulne&s;s, their joyous but de|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t merriment, all contributed to make me almo&s;t imag|ine my&s;elf &s;uddenly tran&s;ported to the i&s;land of Calyp&s;o. They bgan to range them&s;elves in a ring, and invited me to dance. I did not wait for many entreaties. The circle we formed is &s;ingular, from the manner in which it is in|terwoven: the dancer does not give his hand to the two per&s;ons next him, but to tho&s;e next them, &s;o that you have your hands cro&s;&s;ed before your neighbours, who are thus locked, as it were, in the links of a double chain. This interweaving is not without plea&s;ure. In the middle of the circle &s;tood the mu&s;ician, who played and &s;ang at the &s;ame time, while all the dancers kept exact time in advanc|ing, retreating or turning round him. For my&s;elf, I fol|lowed where my partners led me, my mind being le&s;s occupied with the dance, than with the charming females who compo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The next day I took a view of the village: it con&s;i&s;ts of about a hundred hou&s;es, each of them inhabited by a &s;ingle family: they are all of &s;tone, built very &s;trong; and contain, in general, two or three lower parlours, with a couple of rooms above. Each hou&s;e has its oven and ci&s;tern, cut out of the rock. The latter are filled during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, and the water is pre&s;erved in them pure and limpid. Be&s;ides this, a hundred paces

<P>The afternoon of this memorable day was dedicated to plea&s;ure. The Ca&s;iot Captain gave a little ball, and I accepted of his invitation.

<P>Amelia had drawn the outlines of an intere&s;ting por|trait, and the &s;ight of the original proved it a ju&s;t one: for it pre&s;ented the figure of a little elderly woman, with an eye full of vivacity, and &s;uch a calmne&s;s in all her features, as be&s;poke the tranquillity of the mind within.

<P>The mother of Mo&s;es, choo&s;ing to obey nature and God rather than man, hid her &s;on three months.

It came un|der the &s;entence of her father's edict again&s;t the male children of the I&s;raelites. To attempt its re&s;cue might therefore be con&s;trued into an act of di&s;obedience to him, and rebellion again&s;t the government, and might expo&s;e her to private re&s;entment and public cen&s;ure. Any of the&s;e circum&s;tances may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en in her mind, upon the di&s;covery of the child; and to a prejudiced and bigotted under&s;tanding, a cowardly and timorous &s;pirit, or a &s;elfi&s;h and unfeeling heart, might have furni&s;hed an apology for leaving the helple&s;s infant to peri&s;h. But, either &s;he was &s;o wholly lo&s;t in the emotions of pity, which the incident excited as to be inat|tentive to every other con&s;ideration, or (which is more probable) the principles of genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion had &s;uch a commanding power within her, as to overbal|ance every inferior motive.

<P>His &s;i&s;ter, who &s;tood near, ob&s;erving the favourable notice which the prince&s;s took of her infant brother, ven|tured to &s;peak a word in his behalf, and offered to go and call one of the Hebrew women to nur&s;e the child for her.

<P>When Sir James found they were really married, he thought it was in vain to fly in a pa&s;&s;ion; he received them cordially, and gave them an univer&s;al invitation to his hou&s;e, but in his heart he never forgave them. The livings were di&s;po&s;ed of to other people, and at his death he left the whole of his e&s;tate to his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell had only a curacy of about eighty pounds a year, and as regular as the year came round, his wife pre&s;ented him with a child. Poverty took up her habitation among them, and he bitterly regretted having, by an act of di&s;obedience, not only brought on him&s;elf his father's di&s;plea&s;ure, but involved an amiable woman, whom he loved, in a &s;cene of penury and di&s;|tre&s;s. The&s;e reflections &s;oured his di&s;po&s;ition; he be|came peevi&s;h and moro&s;e; nay &s;ometimes went &s;o far, as to reproach his wife as the cau&s;e of his abject &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Campbell took great care to in&s;til into the minds of her children, the re&s;pect and affection due from them to their father. "My dear children," &s;he would often &s;ay, "be a&s;&s;ured a breach of filial duty is ever attended with regret, and in general with misfortune."</P>
<P>Loui&s;a was the elde&s;t of five children; &s;he was mild, meek, and affectionate. She attentively li&s;tened to the precepts of her mother, and laid them up in her heart, as an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure. Mr. Campbell's temper grew &s;o extremely bad, that not only his wife, but his children came in for a &s;hare of his ill humour. Loui&s;a, in par|ticular, was &s;ure to be wrong, in whatever &s;he &s;aid or did, and it was &s;eldom &s;he was favoured with a kind or affec|tionate word; yet her manners were &s;o amiable and her form &s;o lovely, that though &s;he laboured under the di&s;|advantages of a narrow education and extreme poverty, her company was courted by &s;ome of the genteele&s;t fam|ilies in the village; but in compliance with her father's ill humour, &s;he was &s;eldom allowed to &s;tir from home.</P>

it I would have executed them to the utmo&s;t rigour of the law of retaliation, had you not in one moment di&s;|armed me of my malice by a fair confe&s;&s;ion of your love. Believe me, Leander, I never was a coquette but in &s;elf-defence; &s;incerity is my natural character; but how &s;hould a woman of any attractions be &s;afe in &s;uch a char|acter, when the whole circle of fa&s;hion abounds with ar|tificial coxcombs, pretenders to &s;entiment, and profe&s;&s;ors of &s;eduction? Between you and me, Leander, this has been more a conte&s;t of cunning than an affair of honour, and if you will call your own conduct into fair review, tru&s;t me, you will find little rea&s;on to complain of mine. Naturally di&s;po&s;ed to favour your attentions more than any other man's, it particularly behoved me to guard my&s;elf again&s;t propen&s;ities at once &s;o plea&s;ing and &s;o &s;u&s;|picious. Let this &s;uffice in ju&s;tification of what is pa&s;t; it now remains that I &s;hould explain to you the &s;y&s;tem I have laid down for the time to come: if ever I a&s;&s;ume the character of a wife, I devote my&s;elf to all its duties; I bid farewel at once to all the vanities, the petulancies, the coquetries of what is fal&s;ely called a life of plea&s;ure; the whole &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t undergo a revolution, and be ad|mini&s;tered upon other principles and to other purpo&s;es: I know the world too well to commit my&s;elf to it, when I have more than my own con&s;cience to account to, when I have not only truths to &s;tudy; &s;u&s;picions, jealou&s;ies, appearances to provide again&s;t; when I am no longer &s;ingly re&s;pon&s;ible on the &s;core of error, but of example al&s;o: it is not therefore in the public di&s;play of an af|fluent fortune, in dre&s;s, equipage, entertainments, nor even in the fame of &s;plendid charities my plea&s;ures will be found; they will centre in dome&s;tic occupations; in cultivating nature and the &s;ons of nature, in benefiting the tenants and labourers of the &s;oil that &s;upplies us with the means of being u&s;eful; in living happily with my neighbours, in availing my&s;elf of tho&s;e numberle&s;s op|portunities, which a re&s;idence in the country affords of relieving the untold di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e, who &s;uffer in &s;ecret, and are too humble, or perhaps too proud to a&s;k."&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the enraptured Leander could no longer keep &s;ilence; but, breaking forth into tran&s;ports of love and

<HEAD>THE DANGER OF DISSIMULATION.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLOTTE and Maria were educated together at an eminent boarding-&s;chool near London; there was little difference in their age, and their per&s;onal accompli&s;hments were equal: but though their families were of the &s;ame rank, yet, as Charlotte was an only child, &s;he was con&s;iderably &s;uperior in fortune.</P>
<P>Soon after they were taken home, Charlotte was ad|dre&s;&s;ed by Captain Freeman, who, be&s;ides his commi&s;&s;ion in the guards, had a &s;mall paternal e&s;tate: but as her friends hoped for a more advantageous match, the Cap|tain was de&s;ired to forbear his vi&s;its, and the lady to think of him no more. After &s;ome fruitle&s;s &s;truggles, they ac|quie&s;ced; but the di&s;content of both was &s;o apparent, that it was thought expedient to remove Mi&s;s into the country. She was &s;ent to her aunt, the Lady Meadows, who, with her daughter, lived retired at the family &s;eat, more than one hundred miles di&s;tant from the metropo|lis. After &s;he had repined in this dreary &s;olitude from April to Augu&s;t, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed with a vi&s;it from her father, who brought with him Sir James Forre&s;t, a young gentleman who had ju&s;t &s;ucceeded to a baronet's title, and a very large e&s;tate in the &s;ame county. Sir James had good nature and good &s;en&s;e, an agreeable per&s;on and an ea&s;y addre&s;s. Mi&s;s was in&s;en&s;ibly plea&s;ed with his company; her vanity, if not her love, had a new object; a de&s;ire to be delivered from a &s;tate of dependence and ob&s;curity, had almo&s;t ab&s;orbed all the re&s;t; and it is no wonder that this de&s;ire was gratified, when &s;carce any other was felt; or that in compliance with the united &s;olicitations of her friends, and her lover, &s;he &s;uffered her|&s;elf
<PB N="133" REF="035911_0067_1007BF787675ECD0">
within a few weeks to become a lady and a wife. They continued in the country till the beginning of Oc|tober, and then came up to London, having prevailed upon her aunt to accompany them, that Mi&s;s Meadows, with whom the bride had contracted an intimate friend|&s;hip, might be gratified with the diver&s;ions of the town during the winter.</P>
<P>Captain Freeman, when he heard that Mi&s;s Charlotte was married, immediately made propo&s;als of marriage to Maria, with whom he became acquainted during his vi&s;its to her friend, and &s;oon after married her.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip of the two young ladies &s;eemed to be rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed by their marriage; they were always of the &s;ame party, both in the private and public diver&s;ions of the &s;ea&s;on, and vi&s;ited each other without the formalities of me&s;&s;ages and dre&s;s.</P>
<P>But neither Sir James nor Mrs. Freeman could reflect without unea&s;ine&s;s upon the frequent interviews which this familiarity and confidence produced between a lover and his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom force only had divided; and though of the&s;e interviews they were them&s;elves witne&s;&s;es, yet Sir James in&s;en&s;ibly became jealous of his lady, and Mrs. Freeman of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>It happened, in the May following, that Sir James went about ten miles out of town, to be pre&s;ent at the election of a member of parliament for the county, and was not expected to return till the next day. In the evening, his lady took a chair and vi&s;ited Mrs. Freeman: the re&s;t of the company went away early; the Captain was upon guard; Sir James was out of town, and the two la|dies after &s;upper &s;at down to piquet, and continued the game without once reflecting upon the hour till three in the morning. Lady Forre&s;t would then have gone home; but Mrs. Freeman, perhaps chiefly to conceal a contrary de&s;ire, importuned her to &s;tay till the Captain came in, and at length with &s;ome reluctance &s;he con&s;ented.</P>
<P>About five, the Captain came home, and Lady Forre&s;t immediately &s;ent out for a chair: a chair, as it happen|ed, could not be procured; but a hackney-coach being brought in its &s;tead, the Captain in&s;i&s;ted upon waiting on her lady&s;hip home. This &s;he refu&s;ed with &s;ome emotion;
<PB N="134" REF="035911_0068_1007BF7A52BCEFA0">
it is probable that &s;he &s;till regarded the Captain with le&s;s indifference than &s;he wi&s;hed, and was therefore more &s;en|&s;ible of the impropriety of his offer: but her rea&s;ons for rejecting it, however forcible, being &s;uch as &s;he could not allege, he per&s;i&s;ted, and her re&s;olution was overborne. By this importunate complai&s;ance he had not only thrown Lady Forre&s;t into confu&s;ion, but di&s;plea&s;ed his wife: &s;he could not, however, without unpolitene&s;s, oppo&s;e it; and, le&s;t her unea&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be di&s;covered, &s;he affected a neg|ligence which in &s;ome degree revenged it: &s;he de&s;ired that when he came back he would not di&s;turb her, for that &s;he &s;hould go directly to bed; and added, with a kind of drow&s;y in&s;en&s;ibility, "I am more than half a&s;leep already."</P>
<P>Lady Forre&s;t and the Captain were to go from the Haymarket to Gro&s;venor Square. It was about half an hour after five when they got into the coach; the morn|ing was remarkably fine, the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e conte&s;t had &s;haken off all di&s;po&s;ition to &s;leep, and Lady Forre&s;t could not help &s;aying, that &s;he had much rather take a walk in the Park than go home to bed. The Captain zealou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame &s;entiment, and propo&s;ed that the coach &s;hould &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t them down at St. James's Gate. The lady, however, had nearly the &s;ame objections again&s;t being &s;een in the Mall without any other company than the Captain, that &s;he had again&s;t its being known that they were alone togeth|er in a hackney-coach: &s;he, therefore, to extricate her|&s;elf from this &s;econd difficulty, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould call at her father's in Bond&s;treet, and take her cou&s;in Meadows, whom &s;he knew to be an early rifer, with them. This project was immediately put in execution; but La|dy Forre&s;t found her cou&s;in indi&s;po&s;ed with a cold. When &s;he had communicated the de&s;ign of this early vi&s;it, Mi&s;s Meadows entreated her to give up her walk in the Park, to &s;tay till the family ro&s;e, and go home after breakfa&s;t. "No," replied Lady Forre&s;t, "I am determined upon a walk; but as I mu&s;t fir&s;t get rid of Captain Freeman, I will &s;end down word that I will take your advice." A &s;ervant was accordingly di&s;patched to acquaint the Cap|tain, who was waiting below, that Mi&s;s Meadows was in|di&s;po&s;ed, and had engaged Lady Forre&s;t to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="035911_0068_1007BF7A52BCEFA0">The Captain di&s;charged the coach; but being piqued a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the behaviour of his wife, and feeling that flow of &s;pir|its which u&s;ually returns with the morning, even to tho&s;e who have not &s;lept in the night, he had no de&s;ire to go home, and therefore re&s;olved to enjoy the fine morning in the Park alone.</P>
<P>Lady Forre&s;t, not doubting but that the Captain would immediately return home, congratulated her&s;elf upon her deliverance; but, at the &s;ame time, to indulge her de&s;ire of a walk, followed him into the Park.</P>
<P>The Captain had reached the top of the Mall, and turning back met her, before &s;he had advanced two hun|dred paces beyond the Palace. The moment &s;he per|ceived him, the remembrance of her me&s;&s;age, the motives that produced it, the detection of its fal&s;ehood, and di&s;cov|ery of its de&s;ign, her di&s;appointment and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of that very &s;ituation which &s;he had &s;o much rea&s;on to avoid, all concurred to cover her with confu&s;ion, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to hide: pride and good-breeding were, however, &s;till predominant over truth and prudence; &s;he was &s;till zealous to remove from the Captain's mind any &s;u&s;picion of a de&s;ign to &s;hun him, and therefore with an effort perhaps equal to that of a hero, who &s;miles upon the rack, &s;he affected an air of gaiety, &s;aid &s;he was glad to &s;ee him, and as an excu&s;e for her me&s;&s;age and her con|duct, prattled &s;omething about the &s;icklene&s;s of woman's mind, and concluded with ob&s;erving, that &s;he changed her's too often ever to be mad. By this conduct a retreat was rendered impo&s;&s;ible, and they walked together till between eight and nine: but the clouds having in&s;en&s;i|bly gathered, and a &s;udden &s;hower falling ju&s;t as they had reached Spring-Gardens, they went out in&s;tead of going back; and the Captain having put the lady into a chair, took his leave.</P>
<P>It happened that Sir James, contrary to his fir&s;t pur|po&s;e, had returned from his journey at night. He learnt from the &s;ervants, that his lady was gone to Captain Free|man's, and was &s;ecretly di&s;plea&s;ed that &s;he had made this vi&s;it when he was ab&s;ent; an incident, which, however trifling in it&s;elf, was, by the magic of jealou&s;y, &s;welled into importance: yet, upon recollection he reproved
<PB N="136" REF="035911_0069_1007BF7CD25FB088">
him&s;elf for this di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;ince the pre&s;ence of the Cap|tain's lady would &s;ufficiently &s;ecure the honour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e own. While he was &s;truggling with the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, they increa&s;ed both in number and &s;trength in propor|tion as the night wore away. At one, he went to bed; but he pa&s;&s;ed the night in agonies of terror and re&s;ent|ment, doubting whether the ab&s;ence of his lady was the effect of accident or de&s;ign, li&s;tening to every noi&s;e, and bewildering him&s;elf in a multitude of extravagant &s;uppo|&s;itions. He ro&s;e again at break of day; and after &s;ever|al hours of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and irre&s;olution, whether to wait the i&s;&s;ue, or go out for intelligence, the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of curio&s;i|ty prevailed, and about eight he &s;et out for Captain Free|man's; but left word with his &s;ervants, that he was gone to a neighbouring coffee-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Freeman, who&s;e affected indifference and di&s;&s;im|ulation of a de&s;ign to go immediately to bed, contribut|ed to prevent the Captain's return, had during his ab|&s;ence &s;uffered inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;quiet: &s;he had, indeed, nei|ther intention to go to bed, nor inclination to &s;leep; &s;he walked backward and forward in her chamber, di&s;tracted with jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, till &s;he was informed that Sir James was below, and de&s;ired to &s;ee her. When &s;he came down, he di&s;covered that &s;he had been in tears: his fear was now more alarmed than his jealou&s;y, and he concluded that &s;ome fatal accident had befallen his wife; but he &s;oon learnt that &s;he and the Captain had gone from thence at five in the morning, and that he was not yet returned, Mrs. Freeman, by Sir James's inquiry, knew that his lady had not been at home: her &s;u&s;picions were, therefore, confirmed; and in her jealou&s;y, which to prevent a duel &s;he laboured to conceal, Sir James found new cau&s;e for his own. He determined, however, to wait with as much decency as po&s;&s;ible, till the Captain came in; and perhaps two per&s;ons were never more embarra&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of each other. While break|fa&s;t was getting ready, Dr. Tattle came to pay Mrs. Freeman a morning vi&s;it; and, to the un&s;peakable grief both of the lady and her gue&s;t, was immediately admit|ted. Dr. Tattle is one of tho&s;e male go&s;&s;ips who, in the common opinion, are the mo&s;t diverting company in the
<PB N="137" REF="035911_0069_1007BF7CD25FB088">
world. The Doctor &s;aw that Mrs. Freeman was low &s;pir|ited, and made &s;everal efforts to divert her, but without &s;ucce&s;s: at length he declared, with an air of ironical im|portance, that he could tell her &s;uch news as would make her look grave for &s;omething: "The Captain," &s;ays he, "has ju&s;t huddled a lady into a chair, at the door of a bagnio, near Spring-Gardens." He &s;oon perceived that this &s;peech was received with emotions very different from tho&s;e he intended to produce; and therefore added, "that &s;he need not however be jealous; for notwith|&s;tanding the manner in which he had related the incident, the lady was certainly a woman of character, as he in|&s;tantly di&s;covered by her mein and appearance." This particular confirmed the &s;u&s;picion it was intended to re|move; and the Doctor, finding that he was not as good company as u&s;ual, took his leave, but was met at the door by the Captain, who brought him back. His pre&s;ence, however in&s;ignificant, impo&s;ed &s;ome re&s;traint upon the re&s;t of the company; and Sir James, with as good an appear|ance of jocularity as he could a&s;&s;ume, a&s;ked the Captain "What he had done with his wife." The Captain, with &s;ome irre&s;olution, replied, that "he had left her early in the morning at her father's; and that having made a point of waiting on her home, &s;he &s;ent down word that her cou&s;in Meadows was indi&s;po&s;ed, and had engaged her to breakfa&s;t." The Captain who knew nothing of the anecdote, that had been communicated by the Doctor, judged by appearances that it was prudent thus indirect|ly to lie, by concealing the truth both from Sir James and his wife: he &s;uppo&s;ed, indeed, that Sir James would im|mediately inquire after his wife at her father's, and learn that &s;he did not &s;tay there to breakfa&s;t; but as it would not follow that they had been together, he left her to ac|count for her ab&s;ence as &s;he thought fit, taking for grant|ed that what he had concealed &s;he would al&s;o conceal, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons; or, if &s;he did not, as he had affirm|ed nothing contrary to truth, he might pretend to have concealed it in je&s;t. Sir James, as &s;oon as he had receiv|ed this intelligence, took his leave with &s;ome appearance of &s;atisfaction, and was followed by the Doctor.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="035911_0070_1007BF7E65203238">As &s;oon as Mrs. Freeman and the Captain were alone, &s;he que&s;tioned him, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|dy, whom he had been &s;een to put into a chair. When he heard that this incident had been related in the pre&s;+ence of Sir James, he was greatly alarmed le&s;t Lady For|re&s;t &s;hould increa&s;e his &s;u&s;picions, by attempting to con|ceal that, which, by a &s;eries of inquiry to which he was now &s;timulated, he would probably di&s;cover: he con|demned this conduct in him&s;elf, and, as the mo&s;t effect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> means at once to quiet the mind of his wife and obtain her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he told her all that had happened, and his apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equences: he al&s;o urged her to go directly to Mi&s;s Meadows, by whom his account would be confirmed, of whom &s;he might learn farther in|telligence of Sir James; and to find &s;ome way to ac|quaint Lady Forre&s;t with her danger, and admoni&s;h her to conceal nothing.</P>
<P>Mrs. Freeman was convinced of the Captain's &s;inceri|ty, not only by the advice he urged her to give Lady Forre&s;t, but by the con&s;i&s;tency of the &s;tory and the man|ner in which he was affected. Her jealou&s;y was chang|ed into pity for her friend, and apprehen&s;ion for her hu&s;|band. She ha&s;ted to Mi&s;s Meadows, and learnt that Sir James had inquired of the &s;ervant for his lady, and was told that &s;he had been there early with Captain Freeman, but went away &s;oon after him: &s;he related to Mi&s;s Mead|ows all that had happened, and thinking it at lea&s;t po&s;&s;i|ble that Sir James might not go directly home, &s;he wrote the following letter to his lady.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter was given to a chairman, and he was or|dered to &s;ay he brought it from the milliner's; becau&s;e, if it &s;hould he known to come from Mrs. Freeman, and &s;hould fall by accident into Sir James's hands, his curi|o&s;ity might prompt him to read it, and his jealou&s;y to que&s;tion the lady, without communicating the contents.</P>
<P>Sir James being convinced that his lady and the Cap|tain had pa&s;&s;ed the morning at a bagnio, by the an&s;wer which he received at her father's, went directly home. His lady was ju&s;t arrived before him, and had not recov|ered from the confu&s;ion and dread, which &s;eized her, when &s;he heard that Sir James came to town the night before, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant anticipated the con&s;equen|ces of her own indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>She was told he was then at the coffee-hou&s;e, and in a few minutes was thrown into an univer&s;al tremor, upon hearing him knock at the door. He perceived her di&s;|tre&s;s, not with compa&s;&s;ion but rage, becau&s;e he believed it to proceed from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt. He turn|ed pale, and his lips quivered; but he &s;o far re&s;trained his pa&s;&s;ion, as to a&s;k her, without invective, "Where and how &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the night." She replied, "at Captain Freeman's; that the Captain was upon guard; that &s;he &s;at up with his lady till he came in, and that he then in|&s;i&s;ting to &s;ee her home, &s;he would &s;uffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he coach to go no further than her father's, where he left her early in the morning." She had not fortitude to relate the &s;e|quel, but &s;topped with &s;ome appearance of irre&s;olution and terror. Sir James then a&s;ked, "If &s;he came directly from her father's home?" This que&s;tion, and the man|ner in which it was a&s;ked, increa&s;ed her confu&s;ion. To
<PB N="140" REF="035911_0071_1007BF821CCC9EA0">
appear to have &s;topped &s;hort in her narrative, &s;he thought would be an implication of guilt, as it would betray a de&s;ire of concealment: but the pa&s;t could not be recall|ed, and &s;he was impelled by equivocation to fal&s;ehood, from which, however, &s;he would have been kept back by fear, if Sir James had not deceived her into a belief that he had been no further than the neighbourhood. After the&s;e tumultuous reflections, which pa&s;&s;ed in a moment, &s;he ventured to affirm, that "&s;he &s;taid with Mi&s;s Mead|ows till eight, and then came home:" but &s;he uttered this fal&s;ehood with &s;uch marks of guilt and &s;hame, which &s;he had, indeed, no otherwi&s;e than by this fal&s;ehood incur|red or de&s;erved, that Sir James no more doubted her in|fidelity than her exi&s;tence. As her &s;tory was the &s;ame with that of the Captain's, and as one had concealed the truth and the other denied it, he concluded that there was a confederacy between them; and, determining fir&s;t to bring the Captain to account, he turned from her ab|ruptly, and immediately left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the door he met the chairman, who had been di&s;|patched by Mrs. Freeman to his lady; and fiercely in|terrogating him what was his bu&s;ine&s;s, the man produc|ed the letter, and &s;aying, as he had been ordered, that he brought it from Mrs. Fa&s;hion. Sir James &s;natched it from him, and, muttering &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of contempt and re&s;entment, thru&s;t it into his pocket.</P>
<P>It happened that Sir James did not find the Captain at home; he therefore left a billet, in which he reque&s;t|ed to &s;ee him at a neighbouring tavern, and added, that he had put on his &s;word.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his lady, dreading a di&s;covery of the fal&s;ehood which &s;he had a&s;&s;erted, di&s;patched a billet to Captain Freeman; in which &s;he conjured him as a man of honour, for particular rea&s;ons not to own to Sir James, or any other per&s;on, that he had &s;een her after he had left her at her father's: &s;he al&s;o wrote to her cou&s;in Meadows, entreating, that if &s;he was que&s;tioned by Sir James, he might be told that &s;he &s;taid with her till eight o'clock, an hour at which only her&s;elf and the &s;ervants were up.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="035911_0071_1007BF821CCC9EA0">The billet to Mi&s;s Meadows came &s;oon after the chair|man had returned with an account of what had happen|ed to the letter; and Mrs. Freeman was ju&s;t gone in great ha&s;te to relate the accident to the Captain, as it was of importance that he &s;hould know it before his next interview with Sir James: but the Captain had been at home before her, and received both Sir James's billet and that of his lady. He went immediately to the tav|ern, and inquiring for Sir James Forre&s;t, was &s;hewn into a back room, one pair of &s;tairs. Sir James received his &s;alutation without reply, and in&s;tantly bolted the door. His jealou&s;y was complicated with that indignation and contempt, which a &s;en&s;e of injury from a per&s;on of infe|rior rank never fails to produce: he, therefore, demand|ed of the Captain, in a haughty tone, "whether he had not that morning been in company with his wife, after he had left her at her father's?" The Captain, who was incen&s;ed at Sir James's manner, and deemed him&s;elf en|gaged in honour to keep the lady's &s;ecret, an&s;wered, that "after what he had &s;aid in the morning, no man had a right to &s;uppo&s;e he had &s;een the lady afterwards; that to in&s;inuate the contrary was obliquely to charge him with a fal&s;ehood; that he was bound to an&s;wer no &s;uch que&s;tions, till they were properly explained; and that as a gentle|man he was prepared to vindicate his honour." Sir James ju&s;tly deemed this reply an equivocation and an in&s;ult; and being no longer able to re&s;train his rage, he cur&s;ed the Captain as a liar and a &s;coundrel, and at the &s;ame time &s;triking him a violent blow with his fi&s;t, drew his &s;word and put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence. What|ever de&s;ign the Captain might have had to bring his friend to temper, and reconcile him to his wife, when he fir&s;t entered the room, he was now equally enraged, and, indeed, had &s;uffered equal indignity; he, therefore, drew at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and, after a few de&s;perate pa&s;&s;es on both &s;ides, he received a wound in his brea&s;t, and, reel|ing backward a few paces, fell down.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e had brought many people to the door of the room, and it was forced open ju&s;t as the Captain had re|ceived his wound: Sir James was &s;ecured, and a me&s;&s;en|ger was di&s;patched for a &s;urgeon. In the mean time, the

Captain perceived him&s;elf to be dying: and wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ver might before have been his opinion of right and wrong&punc; and honour and &s;hame, he now thought all di&s;&s;imulat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> criminal, and that his murderer had a right to that tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which he thought it meritorious to deny him when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was his friend: he, therefore, earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;peak a few words to him in private.

He then briefly relat|ed all the events as they had happened; and at la&s;t, gra&s;p|ing his hand, urged him to e&s;cape from the window that he might be a friend to his widow and to his child, if its birth &s;hould not be prevented by the death of its father. Sir James yielded to the force of this motive&punc; and e&s;caped as the Captain had directed. In his way to Dover, he read the letter which he had taken from the chairman, and by the next po&s;t inclo&s;ed it in the following to his lady:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"MY DEAR CHARLOTTE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I AM the mo&s;t wretched of all men! But I do not up|braid you as the cau&s;e. Would to God that I were not more guilty than you! We are the martyrs of di&s;&s;imula|tion. By di&s;&s;imulation dear Captain Freeman was in|duced to wa&s;te tho&s;e hours with you, which he would otherwi&s;e have enjoyed with the poor unhappy di&s;&s;em|bler, his wife. Tru&s;ting in the &s;ucce&s;s of di&s;&s;imulation, you was tempted to venture into the Park, where you met him whom you wi&s;hed to &s;hun. By detecting di&s;|&s;imulation in the Captain, my &s;u&s;picions were increa&s;ed; and by di&s;&s;imulation and fal&s;ehood you confirmed them. But your di&s;&s;imulation and fal&s;ehood were the effects of mine; your's were ineffectual, mine &s;ucceeded: for I left word that I was gone no further than the coffee-hou&s;e, that you might not &s;u&s;pect I had learned too much to be deceived. By the &s;ucce&s;s of a lie put into the mouth of a chairman, I was prevented from reading
<PB N="143" REF="035911_0072_1007BF840D1672D8">
a letter, which at la&s;t would have undeceived me; and by per&s;i&s;ting in di&s;&s;imulation, the Captain has made his friend a fugitive and his wife a widow. Thus does in|&s;incerity terminate in mi&s;ery and confu&s;ion, whether, in its immediate purpo&s;e, it &s;ucceeds or is di&s;appointed. O my dear Charlotte! if ever we meet again,&mdash;to meet again in peace is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;but if ever we meet again, let us re&s;olve to be &s;incere: to be &s;incere is to be wi&s;e, innocent, and &s;afe. We venture to commit faults, which &s;hame or fear would prevent, if we did not hope to conceal them by a lie. But in the labyrinth of fal&s;e|hood, men meet tho&s;e evils, which they &s;eek to avoid; and as in the &s;traight path of truth alone they can &s;ee be|fore them, in the &s;traight path of truth alone they can pur|&s;ue felicity with &s;ucce&s;s. Adieu! I am&mdash;dreadful!&mdash; I can &s;ub&s;cribe nothing, that does not reproach and tor|ment me!&mdash;Adieu!"</P>

<HEAD>URGANDA AND FATIMA. AN EASTERN TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of the mo&s;t beautiful vallies that lie upon the borders of the Ea&s;t, lived Zegdad, an inoffen|&s;ive &s;hepherd. He had but one child, and having been early deprived of his wife, he lavi&s;hed his whole &s;tock of tenderne&s;s on Fatima.</P>
<P>Though fortune had not been lavi&s;h of her gifts to the father of Fatima, yet he wanted not the nece&s;&s;aries or the comforts of life; his cottage was clean, and furni&s;h|ed with every thing u&s;eful; his fields &s;upplied him with food, his flock with raiment.</P>
<P>Fatima was coar&s;e in her per&s;on, but &s;he was cheer|ful and good-natured; &s;he ro&s;e each morn with the feathered &s;ong&s;ters, and cheerfully performed the duties of her &s;tation; her whole &s;tudy was to plea&s;e her father,
<PB N="144" REF="035911_0073_1007BF877B500948">
and a &s;mile from Zegdad was, at any time, ample <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ompen&s;e for the &s;evere&s;t fatigue, and like a cordial &s;erv|ed to revive her drooping &s;pirits. She would a&s;&s;i&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;ked, in the mo&s;t laborious employments, and when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> labour of the day was pa&s;t, &s;he would lightly trip over the green turf, with her young companions, while her father played on the flagelet. The mind of Fati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was calm as the delights of paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>One day her father &s;ent her to the Grand Vizier's&punc; with fruit for his favourite; &s;he was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Semira was repo&s;ing on a bed of ro&s;es, clad in all the pomp of ea&s;t|ern magnificence, while two &s;laves were fanning her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;t.</P>
<P>Fatima had never before &s;een aught but &s;implicity: &s;he was filled with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ur|prizing beauty and grandeur of Semira; and as &s;he ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed, envy and di&s;content crept into her hitherto guilele&s;s heart.</P>
<P>She returned home with a mind totally altered from what it was. Her rural pa&s;times no more delighted her; labour was now a trouble; &s;he had been a witne&s;s to the ea&s;e and indolence of Semira. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at any time &s;he caught a glimp&s;e of her per&s;on in the &s;tream, &s;he turned from it with di&s;gu&s;t. Her days were joyle&s;s, and her nights &s;pent in bewailing her unhappy lot.</P>
<P>One evening, deaf to the &s;olicitations of her young companions, &s;he retired to a thick grove, and inattentive to the &s;ound of the flagelet, thus gave vent to her &s;orrow:</P>
<P>"Oh, wretched Fatima! unhappy maid! Why was I born to &s;o hard a fate? to eat the bread of labour, to &s;leep upon a ru&s;hy couch, while Semira is &s;urrounded with &s;plendor, is &s;erved by kneeling &s;laves, and &s;leep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on a bed of down! Why has nature denied me tho&s;e ravi&s;hing beauties, it has &s;o bountifully lavi&s;hed on her? her eyes are bright as the &s;tars, her lips like half-blown ro&s;es, her hand and arm like poli&s;hed ivory. Oh! why was not I lovely as Semira, and favourite to the Grand Vizier? In this low abject &s;tate my being is intolerable; I will no longer endure it, but in yon limpid &s;tream lo&s;e the remembrance of my&s;elf and Semira."</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="035911_0073_1007BF877B500948">At this moment the Fairy Urganda &s;tood before her.</P>
<P>"Thy complaints are ju&s;t, oh, Fatima! (&s;aid &s;he) and if thou wilt relinqui&s;h thy home, and for&s;ake thy father, thou &s;halt enjoy the utmo&s;t extent of thy wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>Fatima eagerly complied with the offered terms, and the Fairy immediately &s;prinkled her with water, at the &s;ame time pronouncing &s;ome my&s;tic words, when &s;he was transformed into a virgin of tran&s;cendant beauty, and found her&s;elf in the garden of a palace belonging to the Grand Vizier.</P>
<P>The lovely Semira had the day before offended her lord, and was no longer a favourite. Fatima attracted the notice of the Vizier; he ordered her to be led into &s;plendid apartments, clothed with co&s;tly robes, adorned with jewels, and appointed &s;laves to wait on her and comply with all her wi&s;hes; and Fatima &s;upplied the place of the degraded Semira.</P>
<P>She now thought her&s;elf the happie&s;t among the hap|py; but the Vizier was pa&s;&s;ionate, capricious, jealous, and extremely cruel; and it was not long before the di&s;|appointed Fatima di&s;covered that to be favourite to the Grand Vizier was to live only in &s;plendid &s;lavery.</P>
<P>"But (&s;aid &s;he often to her&s;elf) though the Grand Vizier's favourite is mi&s;erable, how &s;uperlatively happy mu&s;t be the favourite Sultana of my lord the Emperor! Oh! could I but attain that envied &s;tation, how &s;oon &s;hould the imperious Vizier &s;uffer for his barbarity to me."</P>
<P>Again did the bo&s;om of Fatima &s;uffer all the mi&s;eries of di&s;content; the vaulted roofs, &s;pacious gardens, and rich pre&s;ents of the Vizier, no longer charmed her; &s;he &s;ighed for the en&s;igns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed with her tears.</P>
<P>One evening &s;he retired to an arbour, at the extremity of the garden, and throwing her&s;elf on the banks where &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een Semira, thus poured forth her com|plaints:</P>
<P>"How wretched is the fate of Fatima! condemned to drag a hated being with a man, who &s;tudies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the &s;lave of his caprice and pa&s;&s;ion. Oh! could I but get from this de|te&s;ted
<PB N="146" REF="035911_0074_1007BF89068EFC50">
place, I would fly to my lord the Emperor, and bow my&s;elf low in the du&s;t before him. My charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might reign Em|pre&s;s of the Ea&s;t."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke the&s;e words, a &s;udden light entered the arbour, and the Fairy Urganda again &s;tood before her.</P>
<P>"Beautiful Fatima, (&s;aid &s;he) forbear your com|plaints, the prophet permits you to enjoy your wi&s;h; then ri&s;e and follow me."</P>
<P>The Fairy led her to the Emperor's palace, and plac|ed her among a number of beautiful &s;laves, from among which the Emperor was next morning to choo&s;e a fa|vourite. In the morning the Emperor pa&s;&s;ed through the apartment, and his choice fell on Fatima. She was clothed in the en&s;igns of royalty, led in &s;tate to the mo&s;que, and in a few hours heard her&s;elf proclaimed Empre&s;s of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>But Fatima had to the idea of royalty annexed the ideas of youth and beauty; how &s;urpri&s;ed was &s;he then to find the Emperor old, ugly, and deformed in his per|&s;on, moro&s;e in his di&s;po&s;ition, and jealous in the ex|treme. She &s;hrunk from his embraces with horror, and contracted &s;o &s;ettled an aver&s;ion to him, that not all the &s;plendor which awaited her could in the &s;malle&s;t degree compen&s;ate for the many tedious hours &s;he was obliged to devote to him.</P>
<P>Among the &s;laves that attended on Fatima, was the artful Zynina, who had long, with envious eyes, beheld the love of the Emperor be&s;towed on others, and only watched an opportunity to ingratiate her&s;elf in his favour, by rendering him &s;ome piece of &s;ervice. To this end &s;he cultivated the friend&s;hip of the new Queen, and by de|grees drew from her the rea&s;on of her tears and dejection.</P>
<P>This intelligence was in&s;tantly conveyed to the Em|peror, with the addition of Fatima's heart being dedi|cated to another. O&s;min, willing to be convinced of the truth of Zynina's declaration, de&s;ired to be concealed in an apartment adjoining the Queen's, where he might ea&s;ily overhear any thing that pa&s;&s;ed between her and the deceitful &s;lave, who immediately returned to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and artfully renewed the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="035911_0074_1007BF89068EFC50">Fatima, glad to unburthen her almo&s;t bur&s;ting heart, confe&s;&s;ed her &s;ettled aver&s;ion to her lord, and that death it&s;elf would be preferable to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation. "Then death be thy portion!" cried the enraged Em|peror, furiou&s;ly ru&s;hing into the apartment, and lifting his glittering &s;cimetar.</P>
<P>Fatima fell upon her knees, and, in an agony of terror exclaimed, "Oh that I was an humble cottager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatne&s;s."</P>
<P>At that moment &s;he found her&s;elf clad in her former homely apparel, &s;tanding at the door of her father's cottage, when the Fairy appeared and thus addre&s;&s;ed her:</P>
<P>"Fatima, I have &s;hewn you the vanity of human wi&s;hes; learn from hence to be content with the allot|ments of Providence. Whatever be your &s;ituation in life, &s;ubmit to it without repining; and know that our holy prophet, who ordereth all things in this terre&s;trial world, knoweth what is be&s;t for mortals. Fulfil, there|fore, the re&s;pective duties of thy &s;tation, to the utmo&s;t of thy power: envy not the &s;uperior lot of another, but humbly take the ble&s;&s;ings within thy reach, enjoy them, and be happy."</P>

<HEAD>FILIAL AFEFCTION AND DUTY EXEMPLI|FIED.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Hargrave is one of my earlie&s;t friends. Being many years younger than he, I have ever been accu&s;tomed to regard him both as my guar|dian and my friend: and the reverence, with which I looked on him in one character, never took from the ten|der and affectionate warmth I felt for him in the other. After having been, for &s;ome time, a good deal in the world, he retired to the country, where he lived with elegance and ea&s;e. His wife, a very amiable woman, died &s;oon after her marriage, leaving one only child, a girl, to the care of who&s;e education Mr. Hargrave, af|ter her mother's death, devoted his whole attention. Na|ture had done much for her; and the in&s;truction &s;he re|ceived from an accompli&s;hed father, gave her every grace, which can adorn the female character.</P>
<P>Emily Hargrave was now in her twentieth year. Her father was advanced in life, and he began to feel the weakne&s;&s;es of age coming fa&s;t upon him. Independent of the gratification which he u&s;ed to receive from the ob&s;ervation of his daughter's virtues and accompli&s;h|ments, he had come to feel a plea&s;ure &s;omewhat more &s;elfi&s;h from the advantage, which tho&s;e virtues were of
<PB N="149" REF="035911_0075_1007BF8BCA75BC00">
to him&s;elf. Her care and dutiful attention were become almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to him; and the principal plea&s;ure he received was from her company and conver&s;ation. Em|ily was &s;en&s;ible of this; and, though &s;he was at pains to conceal her &s;olicitude, it was plain that her whole care centered in him.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible that a girl &s;o amiable as Emily Har|grave could fail to attract attention. Several young men of character and fortune became her profe&s;&s;ed ad|mirers. But, though &s;he had a &s;weetne&s;s, which gave her a benevolent affability to all, &s;he was of a mind too delicate to be ea&s;ily &s;atisfied in the choice of a hu&s;band. In her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, &s;he had another objection to every change of &s;ituation. She felt too much anxie|ty about her father, to think of any thing which could call off her attention from him, and make it proper to place any of it el&s;ewhere. With the greate&s;t delicacy, therefore, and with that propriety with which her con|duct was always attended, &s;he checked every advance that was made her; while, at the &s;ame time, &s;he was at the utmo&s;t pains to conceal from her father the volunta|ry &s;acrifice, which &s;he was re&s;olved to make on his ac|count.</P>
<P>About a month ago, I paid a vi&s;it to Mr. Hargrave's family. The imbecilities of age, which were beginning to approach the la&s;t time I had &s;een him, had now made great advances. Formerly Mr. Hargrave u&s;ed to be the delight of every company, and he never &s;poke without being in&s;tructing or entertaining. Now he &s;poke little; when he did, it was with feeblene&s;s both of voice and manner. Feeling his memory declining, &s;en&s;ible that he was not &s;o acute as he once was, and unable to keep up his attention to a continued di&s;cour&s;e, though his under|&s;tanding was &s;till perfectly good, he was afraid to venture his opinion, or to take any decided mea&s;ure. He was too con&s;cious of his own infirmities; and that con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s led him to think that his failure was greater than it really was. In this &s;ituation, his whole dependance was upon Emily, and &s;he was his only &s;upport. Never, indeed, did I &s;ee any thing more lovely, more en|gaging.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="035911_0076_1007BF8D974B8428">To all her other charms, the anxious &s;olicitude &s;he felt for her father had &s;tamped upon her countenance
<Q><L>"That expre&s;&s;ion &s;weet of melancholy</L>
<L>Which captivates the &s;oul."</L></Q></P>
<P>There is &s;omething in the female character, which re|quires &s;upport. That gentlene&s;s, that delicate &s;oftne&s;s approaching to timidity, which forms its mo&s;t amiable feature, makes it &s;tand in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. That &s;up|port and a&s;&s;i&s;tance Emily had received in the complete&s;t manner from her father. What an alteration now! In&s;tead of receiving &s;upport her&s;elf, &s;he was obliged to give it; &s;he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, of coun|&s;elling, and of &s;trengthening the timid re&s;olutions of him, who had been, in her earlier years, her in&s;tructor and her guide, and to whom, next to Heaven, &s;he had ever look|ed up. Emily felt all this; but feeling took not from her the power of acting.</P>
<P>Mr. Hargrave is abundantly &s;en&s;ible of his daughter's goodne&s;s. Her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this, and of how much importance her attentions are to her father, gives her the be&s;t con&s;olation.</P>
<P>While I was at his hou&s;e, he hardly ever &s;poke of him&s;elf. Once, indeed, I remember he &s;aid to me, "I am become a &s;trange being; even the goodne&s;s of that girl di&s;tre&s;&s;es me; it is too much for me to bear: it is," added he, in a very faint and broken voice, "like to overwhelm me."</P>
<P>I have often ob&s;erved, that there is a per&s;everance in virtue, and a real magnanimity in the other &s;ex, which is &s;carcely to be equalled in our's. In the virtue of men, there are generally &s;ome con&s;iderations not altogether pure, attending it, which though they may not detract from, mu&s;t certainly dimini&s;h our wonder at their con|duct.

<HEAD>AN AFFECTING SCENE.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of death has been al|ways made u&s;e of, by the morali&s;t and the divine, as a powerful incentive to virtue and to piety. From the uncertainty of life, they have endeavoured to &s;ink the e&s;timation of its plea&s;ures, and, if they could not &s;trip the &s;eductions of vice of their pre&s;ent enjoyments, at lea&s;t to load them with the fear of their end.</P>
<P>But, though neither the &s;ituation of the world, nor the formation of our minds, allow the thoughts of futurity or death a con&s;tant or prevailing effect upon our lives, they may &s;urely &s;ometimes, not un&s;ea&s;onably, pre&s;s upon our imagination: even exclu&s;ive of their moral or reli|gious u&s;e, there is a &s;ympathetic enjoyment, which often makes it not only better, but more delightful to go to the hou&s;e of mourning, than to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting.</P>
<P>Perhaps I felt it &s;o, when, but a few days &s;ince, I at|tended the funeral of a young lady, who was torn, in the bloom of youth and beauty, from the arms of a fath|er, who doated on her, of a family by whom &s;he was a|dored: I think I would not have exchanged my feelings, at that time, for all the mirth which gaiety could in&s;pire, or all the plea&s;ure which luxury could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Maria was in her twentieth year. To the beauty of her form, and excellence of her natural di&s;po&s;ition, a
<PB N="152" REF="035911_0077_1007BF8FABC834C8">
parent equally indulgent and attentive had done the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|e&s;t ju&s;tice. To accompli&s;h her per&s;on, and to cultivate her mind, every endeavour had been u&s;ed; and they had been attended with that &s;ucce&s;s, which they com|monly meet with, when not prevented by mi&s;taken fond|ne&s;s or untimely vanity. Few young ladies have at|tracted more admiration; none ever felt it le&s;s. With all the charms of beauty, and the poli&s;h of education, the plaine&s;t were not le&s;s affected, nor the mo&s;t ignorant le&s;s a&s;&s;uming. She died when every tongue was eloquent of her virtues, and every hope was ripening to reward them.</P>
<P>It is by &s;uch private dome&s;tic di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that the &s;ofter emotions of the heart are mo&s;t &s;trongly excited. The fall of more important per&s;onages is commonly di&s;tant from our ob&s;ervation; but even where it happens under our immediate notice, there is a mixture of other feel|ings, by which our compa&s;&s;ion is weakened. The emi|nently great, or exten&s;ively u&s;eful, leave behind them a train of interrupted views, and di&s;appointed expectations, by which the di&s;tre&s;s is complicated, beyond the &s;impli|city of pity. But the death of one who, like Maria, was to &s;hed the influence of her virtues over the age of her father and the childhood of her &s;i&s;ters, pre&s;ents to us a little view of family affliction, which every eye can per|ceive, and every heart can feel. On &s;cenes of public &s;orrow and national regret, we gaze as upon tho&s;e galle|ry pictures, which &s;trike us with wonder and admiration; dome&s;tic calamity is like the miniature of a friend, which we wear in our bo&s;oms, and keep for &s;ecret looks and &s;olitary enjoyment.</P>
<P>The la&s;t time I &s;aw Maria was in the mid&s;t of a crowded a&s;&s;embly of the fa&s;hionable and the gay, where &s;he fixed all eyes by the gracefulne&s;s of her motions, and the native dignity of her mien; yet &s;o tempered was that &s;uperiority, which they conferred, with gentlene&s;s and mode&s;ty, that not a murmur was heard, either from the rival&s;hip of beauty, or the envy of homeline&s;s. From that &s;cene the tran&s;ition was &s;o violent to the hear&s;e and the pall, the grave and the &s;od, that once or twice my imagination turned rebel to my &s;en&s;es: I beheld the ob|jects
<PB N="153" REF="035911_0077_1007BF8FABC834C8">

<P>I was &s;oon, however, recalled to the &s;ad reality. The figure of her father bending over the grave of his darling child; the &s;ilent &s;uffering compo&s;ure, in which his coun|tenance was fixed; the tears of his attendants, who&s;e grief was light and capable of tears; the&s;e gave me back the truth, and reminded me that I &s;hould &s;ee her no more. There was a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow of &s;orrow with which I &s;uffer|ed my&s;elf to be borne along, with a melancholy &s;ort of in|dulgence; but when her father dropped the cord, with which he had helped to lay his Maria in the earth, its found on the coffin chilled my heart, and horror for a moment took place of pity!</P>
<P>It was but for a moment. He looked eagerly into the grave; made one involuntary motion to &s;top the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants, who were throwing the earth into it; then &s;udden|ly recollecting him&s;elf, cla&s;ped his hands together, threw up his eyes to Heaven; and then fir&s;t I &s;aw a few tears drop from them. I gave language to all this. It &s;poke a le&s;&s;on of faith, and piety, and re&s;ignation. I went away &s;orrowful, but my &s;orrow was neither ungentle nor unmanly. I ca&s;t on this world a glance rather of pity than of enmity; on the next, a look of humblene&s;s and hope!</P>

<P>When the famine raged with much &s;everity in her na|tive land, Naomi and her hu&s;band Elimelech, and their two &s;ons, went to &s;ojourn in the country of Moab; but Elimelech died, and Naomi, the widow, was left with her children.

It pre&s;ently occurred to the poor woman, as &s;he was journeying on her way, that if &s;he was unhappy, it was no te&s;timony of her affec|tion to involve her &s;ons' wives in equal calamities; and judging the reception &s;he would be likely to meet in the land of Judah, entering it de&s;olate, unfriended, and una|dorned, &s;he pau&s;ed a moment, and thus pathetically ad|dre&s;&s;ed the young widows: "Go, my children, each of you return to your mother's hou&s;e; the Lord deal kind|ly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me. The Lord grant that ye may find re&s;t, each of you, in the hou&s;e of your dear decea&s;ed hu&s;band."

Power, who to every wound hath provided &s;omething <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erewith to heal it, gave the comfort of tears, &s;o that the fullne&s;s of the &s;ad heart is, in part, di&s;charged by that kindly effu&s;ion which Providence has intended as a foun|tain to relieve the exce&s;&s;es of nature; either in the &s;urplus of mi&s;ery or tran&s;port. "They lifted up their voice and wept."&mdash;A folio could not &s;o well di&s;play their condition. After &s;ome time pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;ignificant &s;ilence, they &s;aid unto her, "Surely we will return with thee unto thy people." Here, again, genuine grief di&s;covers it&s;elf: one tender &s;entence, and one only, expre&s;&s;es their de&s;igns and wi&s;hes to attend her. In &s;uch ca&s;es, conci&s;ene&s;s is nature, and circumlocution mere art and affectation. Perceiving the de&s;ign of the daughters, the widow-wom|an Naomi again began to di&s;&s;uade them, and to pre&s;s their &s;peedy return. She painted the various di&s;a&s;ters they would be liable to, in her company; told them &s;he had no more &s;ons to give them for hu&s;bands; nor even a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, however uncheary and forlorn, to accommodate them with in her own country: and, furthermore, that &s;he had not wherewithal to repo&s;e her own head upon, if, af|ter the fatigues of travel, &s;he &s;hould haply arrive &s;afe. And now &s;he once more pre&s;&s;ed the women in a farewel embrace, whil&s;t &s;he clo&s;ed her argument with another ble&s;&s;ing, more melting even than the fir&s;t.&mdash;"Nay, my daughters, weep not, I entreat you. It grieveth me more for your &s;akes than my own, that the hand of the Lord hath gone out again&s;t me." This was the touch|&s;tone: &s;he had now fairly di&s;covered all the horrors of her &s;ituation, and &s;hewed her&s;elf a woman without accom|modation; a traveller, without hope of re&s;t at the end of her journey; and a widow, without one to take her by the hand, and &s;ay unto her, Welcome unfortunate! wel|come again to thine own country. The picture was too deeply &s;haded for Orpah. The dread of poverty, and all its &s;able catalogue of terrors, &s;truck her at once: &s;he &s;hed the tribute of a few more tears, &s;acrificed a few more &s;ighs, and went her way. Not &s;o the affectionate Ruth. How excellently marked, and that, by a &s;ingle word, is the conduct of each. "Orpah <HI>ki&s;&s;ed</HI> her moth|er-in-law; but Ruth <HI>clave</HI> unto her." The &s;entence,

"Orpah ki&s;&s;ed her mother-in-law," i. e. &s;he gave her a farewel embrace, wept a woman's &s;orrow, and left her mother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wander over the world. "But Ruth clave unto her." i. e. clung around her neck, ki&s;&s;ed her with ardour, as if &s;he de&s;igned to leave the &s;eal of her very &s;oul impre&s;&s;ed on her lips forever. In vain did the noble minded Nao|mi exhibit to her the various mi&s;eries which were at hand, and again&s;t which there was no comfortable provi&s;ion. In vain did &s;he point to the example, the politic, the pru|dent example of Orpah, her &s;i&s;ter. In &s;corn of &s;uch con|duct, and to clo&s;e at once all future di&s;&s;ua&s;ions, &s;he th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> declared, to the eternal honour of her &s;ex, the glowing re&s;olutions of her &s;oul.&mdash;"Entreat me not to leave thee, for whither thou goe&s;t I will go, and where thou lodge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I will lodge; thy people &s;hall be my people, and thy God, my God: where thou die&s;t will I die, and there will I be buried." The whole beauty and force of this pa&s;&s;age is not &s;een at once: it is a very fine climax, and there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> amazing elegance in the gradations.

In the next place, &s;he unfolds her fir&s;t de&s;ign to follow her fortunes in whatever part of the habitable globe &s;he thinks proper to pur&s;ue them: but not thinking this &s;uf|ficiently expre&s;&s;ive of her affection, &s;he re&s;olves to take up her abode in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her; to lodge under the &s;ame roof, however poor, and to &s;hare the &s;ame bed, however inelegant. After this, &s;he re&s;olves to know no other people, than &s;uch as are equally the common friends of both; to enter into no attachments, but tho&s;e which are united by the &s;ame tender ties to her dear Na|omi; and to form no connexions whatever, that can, in the lea&s;t, derogate from the love &s;he bore her. But &s;he is not contented with having delivered the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, for &s;he goes on, that her very religion &s;hall be the relig|ion of her friend; that one faith and one hope &s;hall an|imate

their devotion, and the God of one &s;hall be the God of the other. Even this does not &s;atisfy her: for &s;he next determines not only to go with her the pilgrim|age of life, but attend her beyond the gate of death; to die with her Naomi, &s;hould it be Naomi's lot to fall fir&s;t; and to be buried at la&s;t in the &s;ame grave: and this &s;he confirmed by an immediate oath of the utmo&s;t import|ance and &s;anctity among&s;t the daughters of Judah: "The Lord God do &s;o to me, and more al&s;o, if aught but death part thee and me."</P>
<P>"When Naomi &s;aw that &s;he was &s;tedfa&s;tly minded to go, &s;he left off per&s;uading her; &s;o they went until they came to Bethlehem; and when they arrived, it came to pa&s;s, that all the city were moved about them, and they &s;aid, Is this Naomi?" Here are fre&s;h morals and fre&s;h elegancies opened upon us: the di&s;con&s;olate Naomi had no &s;ooner &s;et her foot upon her own land, than all tho&s;e little pa&s;&s;ions, which lie lurking in the bo&s;oms of the il|liberal and the inho&s;pitable, were in&s;tantly awakened. Curio&s;ity &s;urveyed the tatters which &s;he had not the &s;oul to repair. Ill-nature was, we may be &s;ure, officious enough to throw in her bitter &s;arca&s;m. Pride was ready with her in&s;ulting offer of pity. Avarice lamented his incapacity to an&s;wer the good wi&s;hes of his heart; and in &s;hort, every arrogant, every paltry propen&s;ity was in arms again&s;t our defencele&s;s travellers. But as Naomi originally lived in &s;ome degree of comfort and credit in her own country, and was now reduced; <HI>&s;he,</HI> of cour&s;e, more particularly was the mark of their obloquy and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>She &s;oon found, that to rely upon the kindne&s;s of old friends, was but a preca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious mercy. Ill u&s;ed by the world therefore, &s;he began to lo&s;e the hope of &s;uch re|&s;ources. The benevolence of di&s;tant relations, in who&s;e memory &s;he might be able to revive the images of ten|derne&s;s, was likewi&s;e a fond idea, that was born and bu|ried almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant. Nothing of comfort &s;eemed to remain in re&s;erve, till the excellent Ruth, the faithful partner of her &s;ufferings, &s;ugge&s;ted an expedient. And &s;he &s;aid unto her friend&mdash;I perceive, oh my dear Naomi, that our conveniences mu&s;t depend upon our|&s;elves,

<P>"Now it was &s;o that Naomi had a kin&s;man of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hu&s;band's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz:" and it happened as Ruth was gleaning after the reapers, &s;he was &s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">+on a part of the field belonging to Boaz. This circum|&s;tance occa&s;ioned a turn of fortune perfectly dramatic. For, Boaz, coming to take a view of his reapers, per|ceiving the &s;tranger, &s;aid unto the &s;ervant, who was &s;et over the reapers, "Who&s;e dam&s;el is this?" The &s;ervant's an&s;wer is penned with the mo&s;t natural &s;implicity.&mdash;"It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Moabiti&s;h dam&s;el, that came back with Naomi, out of the country of Moab: and &s;he &s;aid, I pray you let me glean, and gather after the reapers, among the &s;heaves; &s;o &s;he came and hath continued among&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> even from the morning till now, that &s;he tarried a little in the hou&s;e." Something there was, either in this ac|count, or in the appearance of the object, which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> much upon the favour of the landlord: for it is &s;urely a &s;ofter voice even than the voice of ho&s;pitality, that &s;peaks in the &s;equel. "Heare&s;t thou not my daughter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> go not I charge you to glean in any other field, neither go from hence, but abide here fa&s;t by my maidens." I have given particular injunctions to "the young men, that they &s;hall not touch thee. And when thou art athir&s;t, go to the ve&s;&s;els and drink of that which the young men have drawn." Here began the fir&s;t fruits of her fidelity; and the partiality of Boaz made a very rapid progre&s;s, for in his &s;econd addre&s;s he was more be|nevolent than in the fir&s;t; he invited her to con&s;ider her&s;elf as one of his own people, to "eat of the bread, to dip her welcome mor&s;el in the vinegar" at meal-times, and to &s;it cheerfully be&s;ide the reapers. Nay, more,

with his own hand&mdash;(&s;urely the heart extended it)&mdash;"he reached her parched corn, and &s;he did eat, and was &s;uf|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, and left." Now it was that Boaz began to di&s;cov|er more evidently, that the &s;pring of this generous cur|rent lay very near the heart. When &s;he was ri&s;en up to glean, after her repa&s;t, he commanded the young men to &s;hew her all po&s;&s;ible marks of courte&s;y and di&s;tinction. His &s;trict orders were, not to &s;uffer her to gather the &s;canty pittance, ear by ear, after the cautious rake had gone over the ground, but to let her glean unque&s;tioned, even among&s;t the &s;heaves. Nay, more, they were to let &s;ome handfulls fall on purpo&s;e for her, and leave them for her particular gleaning: and indeed, &s;uch was the &s;ucce&s;sful con&s;equences of the&s;e indulgencies, that after &s;he had beat out what &s;he had been permitted to glean in one &s;ingle day, "it was about an ephah of barley." This the kind creature carried with all the expedition of affection to her friend: and when Naomi &s;aw it&mdash;when the &s;oul of the &s;orrowful widow &s;ang for joy; then Ruth related to her the whole hi&s;tory of her good fortune, and concluding that the name of the ho&s;pitable owner of the had was Boaz. This intelligence revived her &s;pirits like a cordial, and &s;he exclaims with the mo&s;t animated tran&s;port&mdash;"The man is near a kin to us," my beloved Ruth&mdash;"one of our next kin&s;men." Often, and with equal &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he went, after this, into the field, and con|tinued there to earn a very comfortable living for her|&s;elf and her friend, even to the clo&s;e of the harve&s;t. In the mean time, the pa&s;&s;ion of Boaz had made a very great progre&s;s, and the re&s;ult of it was, that he became the honourable lover of our fair gleaner, and renewed his acquaintance with his relation Naomi, to whom he made, we are told, various pre&s;ents. Boaz and Ruth were &s;oon united; and, as a convincing in&s;tance of the harmony in which the family lived together, we find, highly to the gratification of every benevolent heart, that when Ruth pre&s;ented to Boaz a child&mdash;her fir&s;t-born&mdash;Naomi, after all the peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of her pa&s;t life, re-enjoyed the &s;weets of priva|cy and peace: "for &s;he took the babe, and laid it in her bo&s;om, and became nur&s;e unto it."

<HEAD>THE DEAN OF BADAJOZ; OR, INGRATITUDE DETECTED AND PUNISHED.&mdash;A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dean of the cathedral of Badajoz was more learned than all the Doctors of Salamanca, Coim|bra, and Aleala, united. He under&s;tood all languages, living and dead, and was perfect ma&s;ter of every &s;cience, divine and human; except that, unfortunately, he had no knowledge of magic, and was incon&s;olable when he reflected on his ignorance in that divine art. He was told that a very able Magician re&s;ided in the &s;uburbs of Toledo, named Don Torribio. Immediately he &s;ad|dled his mule, departed for Toledo, and alighted at the door of no very &s;uperb dwelling, the habitation of that great man.</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t reverend Magician," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to the &s;age, "I am the Dean of Badajoz. The learn|ed men of Spain all allow me their &s;uperior; but I am come to reque&s;t from you a far greater honour, that of becoming your pupil. Deign to initiate me in the my&s;|teries of your art, and doubt not but you &s;hall receive a grateful acknowledgment, &s;uitable to the benefit con|ferred, and your own extraordinary merit."</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="035911_0085_1007BFA4F4242CD0">Don Torribio was not very polite, though he valued him&s;elf on being intimately acquainted with the be&s;t company in the infernal regions. He told the Dean he was welcome to &s;eek el&s;ewhere for a ma&s;ter in magic; for that, for his part, he was weary of an occupation, which produced nothing but compliments and promi&s;es; and that he would not di&s;honour the occult &s;ciences, by pro&s;tituting them to the ungrateful.</P>
<P>"To the ungrateful!" cried the Dean: "has then the great Don Torribio met with per&s;ons who have proved ungrateful! and can he &s;o far mi&s;take me as to rank me with &s;uch mon&s;ters?" He then repeated all the maxims and apophthegms, which he had read, on the &s;ubject of gratitude, and every refined &s;entiment his memory could furni&s;h.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he talked &s;o well that the Conjurer, after having con&s;idered a moment, confe&s;&s;ed he could refu&s;e nothing to a man of &s;uch abilities and &s;o ready at per|tinent quotations. "Jacintha," &s;aid he, calling to his old woman, "lay down two partridges to the fire; I hope my friend the Dean will do me the honour to &s;up with me to night." At the &s;ame time he takes him by the hand, and leads him into his cabinet; there he touches his forehead, muttering three my&s;terious words, which I mu&s;t reque&s;t the reader not to forget, <HI>Ortobolan, Pi&s;|tafrier, Onagriou&s;;</HI> then, without further preparation, he began to explain, with all po&s;&s;ible per&s;picuity, the in|troductory elements of his profound &s;cience.</P>
<P>His new di&s;ciple li&s;tened with an attention, which &s;carcely permitted him to breathe; when, on a &s;udden, Jacintha enters, followed by a little man, in mon&s;trous boots, and covered with mud up to the neck, who de&s;i|red to &s;peak with the Dean on very important bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This was the po&s;tillion of his uncle, the bi&s;hop of Ba|dajoz, who had been &s;ent expre&s;s after him, and had galloped quite to Toledo, before he could overtake him; he came to bring him information that, &s;ome hours af|ter his departure, his Grace had been attacked by &s;o vio|lent an apoplexy that the mo&s;t terrible con&s;equences were to be apprehended. The Dean heartily cur&s;ed (in|wardly that is, and &s;o as to occa&s;ion no &s;candal) at once

the di&s;order, the patient, and the courier, who had cer|tainly all three cho&s;en the mo&s;t impertinent time po&s;&s;i|ble.

<P>A few days after he again received news from Bada|joz, but &s;uch as was well worth hearing. The principal Chanter and two old Canons came to inform the Dean that his uncle, the right reverend Bi&s;hop, had been tak|en to heaven to receive the reward of his piety; and, that the Chapter, canonically a&s;&s;embled, had cho&s;en him to fill the vacant bi&s;hopric; and humbly reque&s;ted he would con&s;ole, by his pre&s;ence, the afflicted church of Badajoz, now become his &s;piritual bride.</P>
<P>Don Torribio, who was pre&s;ent at this harangue of the deputies, endeavoured to derive advantage from what he had learned; and, taking a&s;ide the new Bi&s;hop, after having paid him a well turned compliment on his pro|motion, proceeded to inform him that he had a &s;on, nam|ed Benjamin, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much ingenuity and good in|clination; but in whom he had never perceived either ta&s;te or talents for the occult &s;ciences; he had therefore, he &s;aid, advi&s;ed him to turn his thoughts towards the church, and had now, he thanked Heaven, the &s;atisfac|tion to hear him commended as one of the mo&s;t de&s;erv|ing divines among all the clergy of Toledo: he, there|fore, took the liberty, to reque&s;t his Grace to be&s;tow on Don Benjamin the deanery of Badajoz, which he could not retain together with his bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>I am very unfortunate, replied the Prelate, apparently &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed; you will, I hope, do me the ju&s;|tice to believe that nothing could give me &s;o great a plea&s;ure as to oblige you in every reque&s;t. But, the truth is, I have a cou&s;in, to whom I am heir, an old ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic, who is good for nothing but to be a Dean; and if I do not be&s;tow on him this preferment, I mu&s;t em|broil my&s;elf with my family, which would be far from agreeable. But, continued he, in an affectionate man|ner, will you not accompany me to Badajoz? Can you be &s;o cruel as to for&s;ake me ju&s;t at the moment when it
<PB N="171" REF="035911_0086_1007BFA7119FCF70">
is in my power to be of &s;ervice to you? Be per&s;uaded, my honoured ma&s;ter: we will go together; think of nothing but the improvement of your pupil, and leave me to provide for Don Benjamin, nor doubt, but &s;ooner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> later, I will do more for him than you expect. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ltry deanery, in the remote&s;t part of E&s;tramadura, is not a benefice &s;uitable to the &s;on of &s;uch a man as your&s;elf.</P>
<P>The canon law would, no doubt, have con&s;trued this offer of the Prelate's into &s;imony. The propo&s;al, how|ever, was accepted; nor was any &s;cruple made by either of the&s;e two very intelligent per&s;ons. Don Torribio fol|lowed his illu&s;trious pupil to Badajoz, where he had an elegant apartment a&s;&s;igned him in the epi&s;copal palace, and was treated with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, by all the dioce&s;e, as the favourite of his Grace, and a kind of Grand Vicar.</P>
<P>Under the tuition of &s;o able a ma&s;ter, the Bi&s;hop of Badajoz made a rapid progre&s;s in the occult &s;ciences. At fir&s;t he gave him&s;elf up to them, with an ardour which might appear exce&s;&s;ive; but this intemperance: grew by degrees more moderate, and he pur&s;ued them with &s;o much prudence that his magical &s;tudies never interfered with the duties of his dioce&s;e. He was well convinced of the truth of a maxim, very important to be remembered by eccle&s;ia&s;tics, whether addicted to &s;or|cery, or only philo&s;ophers, and admirers of literature, that it is not &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;i&s;t at learned nocturnal meet|ings, or adorn the mind with the embelli&s;hments of hu|man &s;cience; but that it is al&s;o the duty of divines to point out to others the way to heaven, and plant, in the minds of their hearers, whole&s;ome doctrine and Chri&s;tian morality.</P>
<P>Regulating his conduct by the&s;e commendable prin|ciples, the learned Prelate was celebrated throughout Chri&s;tendom for his merit and piety, and promoted, when he lea&s;t expected &s;uch an honour, to the arch|bi&s;hopric of Compo&s;tella.</P>
<P>The people and clergy of Badajoz lamented, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, an event by which they were deprived of &s;o worthy a Pa&s;tor; and the Canons of the cathedral, to te&s;|tify

their re&s;pect, unanimou&s;ly conferred on him the right of naming his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Don Torribio did not neglect &s;o alluring an opport<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ty to provide for his &s;on. He reque&s;ted the bi&s;hopric <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the new Archbi&s;hop, and was refu&s;ed with all imaginable politene&s;s. He had, he &s;aid, the greate&s;t veneration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his old ma&s;ter, and was both &s;orry and a&s;hamed it was not in his power to grant a thing, which appeared &s;o very a trifle; but, in fact, Don Ferdinand de Lara, Con|&s;table of Ca&s;tile, had a&s;ked this &s;ame bi&s;hopric for his natural &s;on; and, though he had never &s;een that noble|man, he had, he &s;aid, &s;ome &s;ecret, important, and what was more, very ancient obligations to him. It was, therefore, an indi&s;pen&s;able duty to prefer an old bene|factor to a new one: but that he ought not to be di&s;|couraged at this proof of his ju&s;tice, as he might learn, by that, what he had to expect when his turn arrived; which it certainly would the very fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>This anecdote, concerning the ancient obligations of the Archbi&s;hop, the Magician had the goodne&s;s to be|lieve; and rejoiced, as much as he was able, that his intere&s;ts were &s;acrificed to tho&s;e of Don Ferdinand.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, was thought of but preparations for their departure to Compo&s;tella, where they were now to re&s;ide. Though the&s;e were &s;carc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly worth the troub|le, con&s;idering the &s;hort time they were de&s;tined to re|main there; for, at the end of a few months, one of the Pope's Chamberlains arrived, who brought the Arch|bi&s;hop a Cardinal's cap, with an epi&s;tle, conceived in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, in which his Holine&s;s invited him to a&s;&s;i&s;t, by his coun&s;el, in the government of the Chri&s;|tian world; permitting him, at the &s;ame time, to di&s;po&s;e of his mitre in favour of whom he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Don Torribio was not at Compo&s;tella when the cou|rier of the holy father arrived. He had been to &s;ee his &s;on, who &s;till continued a Prie&s;t in a &s;mall pari&s;h at Toledo; but he pre&s;ently returned, and was not put to the trouble of a&s;king for the vacant archhi&s;hopric. The Prelate ran to meet him with open arms.</P>
<P>My dear ma&s;ter, &s;aid he, I have two pieces of good news to relate at once. Your di&s;ciple is created a Car|dinal,
<PB N="173" REF="035911_0087_1007BFA8A5BA5340">
and your &s;on &s;hall&mdash;&s;hortly be advanced to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dignity. I had intended, in the mean time, to have be&s;towed on him the archbi&s;hopric of Compo&s;tella; but, unfortunately for him, or rather for me, my mother, whom we left at Badajoz, has, during your ab&s;ence, written to me a cruel letter, by which all my mea&s;ures have been di&s;concerted. She will not be pacified, unle&s;s I appoint for my &s;ucce&s;&s;or the Archdeacon of my former church, Don Pablos de Salazar, her intimate friend and Confe&s;&s;or; &s;he tells me it will occa&s;ion her death, if &s;he &s;hould not be able to obtain preferment for her dear fa|ther in God; and I have no doubt but what &s;he &s;ays is true. Imagine your&s;elf in my place, my dear ma&s;ter: &s;hall I be the death of my mother?</P>
<P>Don Torribio was not a per&s;on who would incite or urge his friend to be guilty of parricide; nor did he in|dulge him&s;elf in the lea&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t the mother of the Prelate.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, however, this mother he talked of was a good kind of woman, nearly &s;uperannuated, who lived quietly with her cat and maid-&s;ervant, and &s;carcely knew the name of her Confe&s;&s;or. Was it likely, then, that &s;he had procured Don Pablos his archbi&s;hopric? Was it not far more probable that he was indebted for it to a Gallician lady, his cou&s;in, a young widow, at once devout and hand&s;ome, in who&s;e company his Grace the Archbi&s;hop had frequently been edified, during his re&s;i|dence at Compo&s;tella? Be it as it may, Don Torribio followed his Eminence to Rome. Scarcely had he ar|rived in that city before the Pope died. It is ea&s;y to im|agine the con&s;equence of this event. The Conclave met. All the voices of the &s;acred college were unanimous in favour of the Spani&s;h Cardinal. Behold him, there|fore, Pope!</P>
<P>Immediately after the ceremony of his exaltation, Don Torribio, admitted to a &s;ecret audience, wept with joy, while he ki&s;&s;ed the feet of his dear pupil, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m he &s;aw fill, with &s;o much dignity, the pontifical throne. He mode&s;tly repre&s;ented his long and faithful &s;ervices. He reminded his Holine&s;s of his promi&s;es: tho&s;e inviolable promi&s;es he had renewed before he entered the Conclave.

Such as an annuity for life, &s;ufficient for the few wants of an eccla|&s;ia&s;tic and a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>During this ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">angue, the &s;overeign Pontiff con&s;idered within him&s;elf how to di&s;po&s;e of his preceptor. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|flected that he was no longer very nece&s;&s;ary; that he al|ready knew more of magic than was &s;ufficient for a Pope; that it mu&s;t be highly improper for him to appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> at the nocturnal a&s;&s;emblies of &s;orcerers, and a&s;&s;i&s;t at their indecent ceremonies. After weighing every circum|&s;tance, his Holine&s;s concluded that Don Torribio was not only a u&s;ele&s;s but a trouble&s;ome dependant; and, this point decided, he was no longer in doubt what an|&s;wer to return: accordingly he replied in the following words; "We have learned, with concern, that, under the pretext of cultivating the occult &s;ciences, you main|tain a horrible intercour&s;e with the &s;pirit of darkne&s;s and deceit; wherefore we exhort you, as a father, to ex|piate your crime by a repentance proportionable to its enormity. Moreover, we enjoin you to depart from the territories of the church, within three days, under pain of being delivered over to the &s;ecular arm, and its mer|cile&s;s flames."</P>
<P>Don Torribio, without being di&s;concerted, immedi|ately repeated aloud the three my&s;terious words which the reader was de&s;ired to remember; and, going to the window, cried out, with all his force, "Jacintha, you need &s;pit but one partridge; for my friend, the Dean, will not &s;up here to-night."

<HEAD>CAUTIONARY HINTS TO LEARNED LADIES.</HEAD>
<P>TO be affected in any way, is, at all times, in all places, and in all degrees to be di&s;agreeable. But affectation of learning and author&s;hip, in a woman of very little merit, draws upon it&s;elf the contempt and hatred of both &s;exes. They who excel mo&s;t in either &s;ex, are found by experience to be mo&s;t candid and mode&s;t, to a&s;&s;ume lea&s;t, and to join in conver&s;ation with others without di&s;playing the &s;en&s;e of their &s;uperiority. Indeed it often happens, that there is an amiable humility in true genius and learning, which compels the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them to think diffidently of his own character, amid the united prai&s;es of all around. Let her, then, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the bright jewels of genius and learning, take care to &s;et them in a plain manner, and their lu&s;tre will di&s;|play additional brilliancy.</P>

Even the affectation of philanthropy will in time contrib|ute to realize it. The plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from an act of kindne&s;s naturally excites a wi&s;h to repeat it; and indeed the general e&s;teem which the character of benevolence procures, is &s;ufficient to induce tho&s;e to wi&s;h for it, who act only from the mean motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>SENSIBILITY.</HEAD>
<P>SENSIBILITY, with all its inconveniences, is to be cheri&s;hed by tho&s;e who under&s;tand and wi&s;h to maintain the dignity of their nature. To feel for oth|ers, di&s;po&s;es us to exerci&s;e the amiable virtue of charity, which our religion indi&s;pen&s;ably requires. It con&s;ti|tutes that enlarged benevolence, which philo&s;ophy inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|cates, and which is indeed comprehended in Chri&s;tian charity. It is the privilege and the ornament of man; and the pain which it cau&s;es is abundantly recompen&s;ed by that &s;weet &s;en&s;ation which ever accompanies the ex|erci&s;e of beneficence.</P>
<P>To feel our own mi&s;ery in a lively manner is not to be deprecated. Affliction &s;oftens and improves the heart. Tears, to &s;peak in the &s;tyle of figure, fertilize the &s;oil in which the virtues grow. And it is the remark of one who under&s;tood human nature, that the faculties of the mind, as well as the feelings of the heart, are meliorated by adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>But in order to promote the&s;e ends, our &s;ufferings mu&s;t not be permitted to overwhelm us.

<HEAD>THE WANT OF PERSONAL BEAUTY A FRE|QUENT CAUSE OF VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been ju&s;tly &s;aid, that no one ever de&s;|pi&s;ed beauty who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. It is indeed a noble privilege to be able to give plea&s;ure wherever one goes, merely by one's pre&s;ence, and without the trouble of ex|ertion. The re&s;pect which is paid to beauty, and the recommendation it gives to all our good qualities, are circum&s;tances &s;ufficiently advantageous to render the per&s;on, who has been ble&s;t with it, &s;incerely grateful.</P>
<P>But the majority of mankind, if they are not deform|ed, are yet not beautiful. And this is a wife and be|nevolent di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence; for, notwith&s;tand|ing the ju&s;t preten&s;ions of beauty, I am convinced that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he want of it is often attended with great benefit to &s;ociety. Man is naturally de&s;irous of rendering him&s;elf, in &s;ome re&s;pect, valuable and amiable; and, if he has nothing external to recommend him, will endeavour to compen&s;ate his defect by the acqui&s;ition of internal ex|cellence. But that the virtues of the heart, and the abilities of the under&s;tanding, contribute much more to public benefit than any per&s;onal grace or accompli&s;h|ment, is a truth which needs no confirmation.</P>
<P>It is indeed a well known fact, that many of the be&s;t poets, philo&s;ophers, writers, and arti&s;ts, have been of the number of tho&s;e who were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, prevented in their youth from indulging idlene&s;s and profligacy, either by &s;ome con&s;titutional infirmity, or by the want of tho&s;e per&s;onal graces, which are the greate&s;t allurements to a life of di&s;&s;ipation. Among a thou&s;and in&s;tances, in confirmation of this truth, I will &s;elect that of Pope; to the deformity and imbecility of who&s;e body we may at|tribute his early and con&s;tant application to poetry. Where there are powerful &s;olicitations to the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, very little attention will be paid to the pure de|lights of contemplation and benevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="035911_0092_1007BFB2C1829CA8">But it is more particularly my de&s;ign to point o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ome advantages attending the want of beauty in women&punc; a want which will always be con&s;idered by them as a misfortune. But all misfortunes admit of con&s;olation; and many of them, under a judicious conduct, may be metamorpho&s;ed into ble&s;&s;ings. While, however, I con|&s;ider the advantages attending the want of per&s;onal charms, I mu&s;t not be under&s;tood to undervalue beauty. If we admire the lifele&s;s works of art, much more &s;hould we be delighted with the a&s;&s;emblage of living features, in which are united &s;ymmetry and expre&s;&s;ion. It is Na|ture's command that we &s;hould be charmed with her productions, both animate and inanimate; and our hearts are mo&s;t willingly obedient, when &s;he bids us admire beauty in our own &s;pecies. Ta&s;te, fancy and affection, are then all at once mo&s;t powerfully a&s;&s;aulted, and it would be as unnatural, as it is vain, to re&s;i&s;t, by refu&s;ing our admiration.</P>
<P>But after our admiration is over, we &s;hall find, when we exerci&s;e our reflec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on and judgment, what experience has indeed proved, that plain women are often entitled to the mo&s;t e&s;teem. It may appear paradoxical, but I will a&s;&s;ert it to be true, that women who have no great pre|ten&s;ions to beauty, are u&s;ually found, as the companions of life, the mo&s;t agreeable. They are, indeed, for the mo&s;t part, I do not &s;ay always, the be&s;t daughters, the be&s;t wives, the be&s;t mothers; mo&s;t important relations, and mo&s;t honourable to tho&s;e who &s;upport them with propriety. They who aim not at &s;uch characters, but live only to di&s;play a pretty face, can &s;carcely rank high|er than a painted doll, or a blockhead, placed with a cap on it, in a millener's window.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething of an irritability in the con&s;titution of women, who&s;e minds are uncultivated, which, when increa&s;ed by oppo&s;ition, and confirmed by habit, u&s;ually produces a termagant, a &s;hrew, or a virago; characters which, from the torment they occa&s;ion, may be &s;aid greatly to participate of an infernal nature. Nothing but reading, reflection, and indeed what is called a liber|al education, can, in general, &s;mooth this natural a&s;perity. A woman, who, by attending to her face, is led to neglect

the mind, and who, be&s;ides, has been flattered in her youth by the admirers of her beauty, &s;eldom fails, in the more advanced periods of her life, to vent the virulence of her temper, now &s;oured and blackened by neglect, on all who have the misfortune to approach her. Her hu&s;|band (if &s;he has, peradventure, entangled &s;ome mi&s;erable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight) undergoes &s;uch torments as might ju&s;tly re&s;cue him from purgatory, by the plea of having &s;uffered it al|ready.</P>
<P>But folly and ignorance are almo&s;t as pregnant with dome&s;tic mi&s;ery as a bad temper. And how &s;hall &s;he avoid folly and ignorance, with all their train of whims, &s;icklene&s;s, fears, fal&s;e delicacies, vanity, pride, affectation, envy, peevi&s;hne&s;s, fretfulne&s;s, childi&s;hne&s;s, and <HI>weakne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es,</HI> who has &s;pent all the days when &s;he was young, and all the days &s;he thought her&s;elf young, at her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lette, and under the hands of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">izeur? She found her&s;elf admited wherever &s;he went, without &s;aying or do|ing any thing admirable. She has therefore &s;aved her&s;elf the trouble of forming a ta&s;te for reading, or a habit of thinking. But beauty is a ro&s;e, which &s;oon withers. She lo&s;es the power of plea&s;ing others; and, alas! po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es none to plea&s;e her&s;elf, which can &s;upply the place of flat|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery and pretended adoration.

If &s;he continued unmarried, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed few qualities to render her acquaintance &s;olicited, and none that could afford her a rational amu&s;ement in &s;olitude.</P>
<P>It may indeed happen, that a beautiful woman may be educated with uncommon vigilance, that &s;he may po&s;&s;e&s;s a remarkably good under&s;tanding, and as good a di&s;po&s;i|tion.

<HEAD>ON THE LITERARY EDUCATION OF WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many prejudices entertained again&s;t the character of a learned lady; and, perhaps, if all ladies were profoundly learned, &s;ome inconveniences might ari&s;e from it: but, I mu&s;t own, it does not appear to me, that a woman will be rendered le&s;s acceptable in the world, or wor&s;e qualified to perform any part of her duty in it, by having employed the time, from &s;ix to &s;ix|teen, in the cultivation of her mind. Time enough will remain, after a few hours every day &s;pent in reading, for the improvement of the per&s;on, and the acqui&s;ition of the u&s;ual accompli&s;hments. With re&s;pect to the&s;e accom|pli&s;hments, I will not pre&s;ume to direct the method of pur&s;uing them. I will not &s;o far intrude on a province, which by no means belongs to me. The ladies them|&s;elves, and their in&s;tructors, want no directions in matters of external ornament, the end of which is to plea&s;e on in|tuition. However arrogant the men have been in their clai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of &s;uperiority, they have u&s;ually allowed the la|dies the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a delicate ta&s;te in the improvement and perception of all kinds of beauty.</P>
<P>The literary education of women ought indi&s;putably to be varied according to their fortunes and their expec|tations. Much refinement, and a ta&s;te for books, will in|jure her, who&s;e time, from prudential motives, mu&s;t be entirely engro&s;&s;ed by economy. Few women are, indeed, exempted from all attention to dome&s;tic care; but, yet, the unmarried, and tho&s;e who enjoy opulence, find many

intervals which they often devote to &s;ome &s;pecies of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">+ing. And there is no doubt, but that the reading would be &s;elected with more judgment, and would afford mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e plea&s;ure and advantage, if the ta&s;te were formed by early culture.</P>
<P>It is well known, that internal beauty contributes much to perfect external grace.

But how agreeable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my &s;urpri&s;e, when fancy added to the company an old friend of my own &s;ex, and my amiable Ophelia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom this circum&s;tance I &s;u&s;pected what I &s;oon di&s;cover|ed to be fact, that this group of females, who&s;e mutual friend&s;hip I had been admiring, were al&s;o &s;i&s;ters. Shame, &s;hame on the world, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, that a family of &s;i&s;ters, living together in perfect harmony and love, &s;hould be a &s;ight &s;o rare as to excite &s;urpri&s;e. If before, I felt intere&s;ted in their happine&s;s, and perceived a kind|ly affection for them ari&s;ing in my brea&s;t, I now loved them mo&s;t cordially. Turn hither your eyes, ye &s;i&s;ters, whom envy, jealou&s;y, or any &s;uch ra&s;cally pa&s;&s;ion &s;o oft|en embroils, and learn the beauty, the excellency, and felicity of loving each other as friends.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the evening, Fancy introduced two of three young gentlemen of the vicinity, who increa&s;ed, while they enjoyed, the fe&s;tivity of the company. She al&s;o &s;ketched out the amu&s;ements that took place in the intervals of conver&s;ation. At one time, &s;he repre&s;ented you as li&s;tening with plea&s;ed attention, to a &s;prightly or &s;entimental &s;ong warbled out by one of the young ladies; and then in&s;tantly placed you all on the floor, tracing out
<PB N="190" REF="035911_0096_1007BFBC33FF9988">
the intricacies of the mazy dance. The &s;portive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> even went &s;o far as to paint the refre&s;hments that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> liberally offered you; among which &s;he did not forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the &s;erver of "wine, which maketh glad the heart of man," though &s;he hinted, as &s;he introduced it, that, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this ca&s;e, it was quite unnece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e; be|cau&s;e the cheerfulne&s;s of the company could receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> additions from it.</P>
<P>I could not help ob&s;erving that the painter took par|ticular care to keep an empty chair in the circle. It was a circum&s;tance I could not well account for. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> la&s;t conjectured that it was de&s;igned as an emblem of ho&s;pitality; and fancy confirmed me in it. How happy &s;hould I be, thought I, could I but occupy it for the eve|ning! To have been a witne&s;s to, and partaker of the plea&s;ures of a mixed company, where each one was more &s;olicitous to communicate than to receive happine&s;s, for one hour, would have been worth more than a common month. By this time, fancy had wrought up the col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">+ing of the piece to &s;uch a height, that I was afraid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e upon it any longer, le&s;t I &s;hould be involuntarily &s;eized with the hateful pa&s;&s;ion, which, according to Mil|ton, made the <HI>old fellow</HI> with the <HI>bad character,</HI> avert hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eyes from Adam and Eve in paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>It was not till the clo&s;e of the evening that fancy in|troduced into the company the re&s;pectable father of the family. He came not even then to &s;poil, but only to temper and enjoy their fe&s;tivity. Recollecting the days of his youth, when the genial blood flowed warm in his veins, he knew how to indulge the innocent gaiety of his children and their companions; and therefore, "his ea&s;y pre&s;ence check'd no decent joy." This was Fancy's la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> labour; for when &s;he had added this figure to the group, &s;he threw a&s;ide her pencil&mdash;&s;aid, it is completed! and politely di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me from her pre&s;ence.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.&mdash;THE RURAL TASTE OF A TRADESMAN'S WIFE EXPOSED.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NEVER was any poor devil of a hu&s;band plagued in the manner I am with the &s;ingularities of a wife. You mu&s;t know, Sir, though her father was a carca&s;s-butcher in White-Chapel, though &s;he was educat|ed at a boarding-&s;chool in Thames-&s;treet, and never travelled farther than Bethnal-Green, or Hoxton, or Hackney, or Newington-Butts; yet &s;he affects &s;uch a ta&s;te and pa&s;&s;ion for the country, as would have ruined the patience of all the heathen philo&s;ophers put together: every room in my hou&s;e, from the cellar to the gar|rets, bears te&s;timony to her rural ideas in &s;ome way or other: the leads of my hou&s;e, and the rails of my win|dows, are crowded with pots and pans, and vegetables and evergreens, like the &s;hop of a botani&s;t or &s;eed&s;man. When I go into the kitchen, I find the light, which is none of the livelie&s;t at the be&s;t, totally &s;hut out by a range of phy&s;ic phials, huddled together as clo&s;e as they can &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ick, and filled with mint, to give the windows a rural appearance. Then, Sir, the dining-room windows, in &s;ummer time, are &s;o cro&s;&s;ed and crowded with pack-threads, fa&s;tened like bars from the top to the bottom of them, that if it were not for the French beans, which clu&s;ter round the &s;trings, it would enliven my mind with the plea&s;ing imagination of being cooped up in a &s;pung|ing-hou&s;e. Every chimney corner is then &s;et out, as it is called, with bough-pots, and not a china jar in my hou&s;e e&s;capes an ornament from Covent-Garden market. I have been, you mu&s;t know, &s;everely lectured for this week pa&s;t, for &s;poiling a charming bed of par&s;ley, as my wife calls it, upon the leads, while I was giving a brick-layer orders to make &s;ome repairs to the chimney; and what is &s;till more provoking, upon inquiring for my be&s;t wig-box, a few days ago, I was told, by the maid, that
<PB N="192" REF="035911_0097_100792EFA661F168">
the box was put to a much better u&s;e; for that her mi&s;|tre&s;s had &s;own a &s;allad in it of mu&s;tard and cre&s;e, which would be fit to cut in a few days.

As I hope to be &s;aved, &s;he had &s;ome time &s;ince a geranium in full blo&s;&s;om, which, to &s;ave expen&s;e, was &s;tuck fa&s;t in a c&mdash;e f&mdash;l pan; a myrtle in a butter firkin; an orange-tree in a wa&s;hing-tub; a tulip in a &s;alt-box, and a young goo&s;eberry bu&s;h in a punch-bowl. Nay, to &s;uch a pitch of extravagance does this enthu&s;i+a&s;tic helpmate of mine carry this gardening ta&s;te of her's, that the hou&s;e was thrown into convul&s;ions three days ago, upon a report that the cat had kittened upon the gra&s;s-plot, which grew upon the top &s;helf of the pantry. Then, Sir, to add to my vexation, I have had the happi|ne&s;s to be threatened with an indictment for being a nui|&s;ance to my neighbours and the public, as hardly a week pa&s;&s;es without &s;ome pan or pot tumbling upon the heads of the pa&s;&s;engers, and doing &s;ome mi&s;chief or other. If I expo&s;tulate, I have no ta&s;te; if I threaten, I have no humanity; if I coax her, I have no influence; and if I give way to her, I can expect no comfort. My very bed-room, in &s;ummer, Sir, is &s;o filled with flowers, that I am in nightly dread of being perfumed to death be|fore morning. Then I never mu&s;t &s;tir out without a no&s;egay in my button-hole, becau&s;e it makes &s;o rural and &s;o countrified an appearance. In &s;hort, what with rural &s;ights, and rural &s;mells, and rural conver&s;ation, rural or|naments, and rural non&s;en&s;e, of one kind or another, my patience is quite exhau&s;ted: therefore I take this public method of giving my wife warning, that unle&s;s there is a thorough reformation in her manners, I am determin|ed to a&s;&s;ert &s;ome &s;pirit, to turn the gra&s;s-plot out of the hou&s;e at a minute's notice &s;end the par&s;ley bed into the du&s;t tub, pack up her &s;hrubbery in an hamper, and re|&s;tore my wig-box to its proper u&s;e.</P>

Nothing but the &s;un can convince them of its approach; and they keep them|&s;elves &s;o mewed up in their apartments, that they think very little of con&s;ulting him. As for us, we enjoy his kindly beams already. The country, which was &s;o dull for &s;ome months, has re-a&s;&s;umed all its charms. The trees, have &s;haken off winter's &s;qualid dre&s;s, to put on, once more, the livery of &s;pring.

A &s;ky clouded with &s;moke; dirty &s;treets; in &s;hort, the &s;ame objects that you have &s;een all winter. The hou&s;e-tops, it is true are no longer covered with &s;now and icicles, but your dun tiles, even with this advantage, afford no very brilliant pro&s;pect. Do you &s;ee, as I do, the &s;un's ri&s;ing beams deck the fre&s;h leaf with purple and gold? do you &s;ee the dew-drops &s;hine like pearls, before his warmth dries them up? do you &s;ee him, when he emerges from behind the hill, in|undate the va&s;t horizon with a torrent of light?

<HEAD>LETTER IV.&mdash;TO THE AUTHOR OF THE MIRROR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME time ago I troubled you with a letter, giving an account of a particular &s;ort of grievance felt by the families of men of &s;mall fortunes, from their ac|quaintance with tho&s;e of great ones. I am emboldened, by the favourable reception of my fir&s;t letter, to write you a &s;econd upon the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>You will remember, Sir, my account of a vi&s;it my daughters paid to a great lady in our neighbourhood, and of the effects which that vi&s;it had upon them. I was beginning to hope that time, and the &s;obriety of manners, which home exhibited, would re&s;tore them to their former &s;ituation, when, unfortunately, a circum|&s;tance happened, &s;till more fatal to me than their expe|dition to &mdash;. This, Sir, was the honour of a vi&s;it from the great lady in return.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t returned from the &s;uperintendance of my ploughs in a field I have lately inclo&s;ed, when I was met on the green, before my door, by a gentleman (for &s;uch I took him to be) mounted upon a very hand&s;ome geld|ing, who a&s;ked me by the appellation of hone&s;t friend, if this was not Mr. Home&s;pun's; and in the &s;ame breath, whether the ladies were at home? I told him, my name was Home&s;pun, the hou&s;e was mine, and my wife and daughters were, I believed, within. Upon this, the young man, pulling off his hat, and begging my pardon for calling me hone&s;t, &s;aid he was di&s;patched by Lady &mdash;, with her compliments to Mrs. and Mi&s;&s;es Home&s;pun, and that if convenient, &s;he intended her&s;elf the honour of dining with them, on her return from B&mdash; park (the &s;eat of another great and rich lady in our neighbour|hood.)</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, Mr. Mirror, I was &s;truck &s;omewhat of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eap with the me&s;&s;age; and it would not, in all proba|bility,
<PB N="196" REF="035911_0099_1007BFC536CD8E68">
have received an immediate an&s;wer, had it not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> overheard by my elde&s;t daughter, who had come to the window on the appearance of a &s;tranger. "Mr. Papillot," &s;aid &s;he immediately, "I rejoice to &s;ee you; I hope your Lady and all the family are well." "Very much at your &s;ervice Ma'am," replied he, with a low bow; "my Lady &s;ent me before, with the offer of her be&s;t compliments, and that, if convenient,"&mdash;and &s;o forth, repeating his words to me. "She does us infinite honour," &s;aid my young madam; "let her Lady&s;hip know how happy her vi&s;it will make us; but in the mean time, Mr. Papillot, give your hor&s;e to one of the &s;ervants, and come in and have a gla&s;s of &s;omething after your ride." "I am afraid," an&s;wered he, (pulling out his right-hand watch) for, would you believe it, Sir? the fellow had one in each fob, "I &s;hall hardly have time to meet my Lady at the place &s;he appointed me." On a &s;econd invitation, however, he di&s;mounted, and went into the hou&s;e, leaving his hor&s;e to the care of the &s;ervants; but the &s;ervants, as my daughter very well knew, were all in the fields at work; &s;o I, who have a liking for a good hor&s;e, and cannot bear to &s;ee him neglected, had the honour of putting Mr. Papillot's in the &s;table my&s;elf.</P>
<P>After about an hour's &s;tay, (for the gentleman &s;eemed to forget his hurry within doors) Mr. Papillot departed. My daughters, I mean the two polite ones, ob&s;erved how hand&s;ome he was; and added another ob&s;ervation, that it was only to particular friends my Lady &s;ent me&s;&s;ages by him, who was her own body &s;ervant, and not accu&s;|tomed to &s;uch offices. My wife &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with this la&s;t remark: I was about to be angry, but on &s;uch occa&s;ions it is not my way to &s;ay much; I general|ly &s;hrug up my &s;houlders in &s;ilence; yet, Mr. Mirror, I would not have you think me hen-peck'd.</P>
<P>By this time, every dome&s;tic about my hou&s;e, male and female, were called from their &s;everal employments to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the preparation for her Lady&s;hip's reception. It would tire you to enumerate the various &s;hifts that were made, by purcha&s;ing, borrowing, &amp;c. to furni&s;h out a dinner &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion. My little grey poney, which I keep for &s;ending to market, broke his wind in

the cau&s;e, and has never been good for any thing &s;ince. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r was there le&s;s ado in making our&s;elves and our at|tendants fit to appear before &s;uch company. The female p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of the family managed the matter pretty ea&s;ily: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, I ob&s;erve, have a natural talent that way. My wife took upon her&s;elf the charge of apparelling me for the occa&s;ion. A laced &s;uit, which I had worn at my marriage, was got up for the purpo&s;e; but the breeches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a &s;eam at the very fir&s;t attempt of putting them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and the &s;leeves of the coat were al&s;o impracticable; &s;o &s;he was forced to content her&s;elf with cloathing me in my Sunday's coat and breeches, with the laced wai&s;t-coat of the abovementioned &s;uit, &s;lit in the back, to &s;et them off a little. My gardener, who has been accu&s;tom|ed, indeed, to &s;erve in many capacities, had his head craped, curled, and powdered, for the part of butler; one of the be&s;t looking plough-boys had a yellow cape clapped to his Sunday's coat to make him pa&s;s for a &s;ervant in livery; and we borrowed my &s;on-in-law the par&s;on's man for a third hand.</P>
<P>All this was accompli&s;hed, though not without &s;ome tumult and di&s;order, before the arrival of the great La|dy. She gave us, indeed, more time for the purpo&s;e than we looked for, as it was near &s;ix o'clock before &s;he arrived. But this was productive of a misfortune on the other hand: the dinner my poor wife had bu&s;tled, &s;weated, and &s;colded for, was &s;o over-boiled, over-&s;tewed, and over-roa&s;ted, that it needed the appetite of &s;o late an hour to make it go well down, even with me, who am not very nice in the&s;e matters: luckily, her Lady&s;hip, as I am told, never eats much, for fear of &s;poiling her &s;hape, now that &s;mall wai&s;ts have come into fa&s;hion again.</P>
<P>The dinner, however, though &s;poiled in the cooking, was not thrown away, as her Lady&s;hip's train made &s;hift to eat the greate&s;t part of it. When I &s;ay her train, I do not mean her &s;ervants only, of which there were half a dozen in livery, be&s;ides the illu&s;trious Mr. Papillot, and her Lady&s;hip's maid, (gentlewoman, I &s;hould &s;ay) who had a table to them&s;elves. Her parlour attendants were equally numerous, con&s;i&s;ting of two
<PB N="198" REF="035911_0100_1007BFC70981B740">
ladies and &s;ix gentlemen, who had accompanied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lady&s;hip in this e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cur&s;ion, and did us the honour o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> coming to eat and drink with us, and bringing their &s;er|vants to do the &s;ame, though we had never &s;een or heard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them before.</P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of this entertainment, there were &s;everal little embarra&s;&s;ments, which might appear ridic|ulous in de&s;cription, but were matters of &s;erious di&s;tre&s;s to us; &s;oup was &s;pilled, di&s;hes overturned, and gla&s;&s;es broken, by the awkwardne&s;s of our attendants; and things were not a bit mended by my wife's &s;olicitude (who to do her ju&s;tice had all her eyes about her) to cor|rect them.</P>
<P>From the time of her Lady&s;hip's arrival, it was im|po&s;&s;ible that dinner could be over before it was dark; this, with the con&s;ideration of the bad road &s;he had to pa&s;s through in her way to the next hou&s;e &s;he meant to vi&s;it, produced an invitation, from my wife and daugh|ters, to pa&s;s the night with us; which, after a few word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of apology for the trouble &s;he gave us, and a few m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the honour we received, was agreed to. This gave ri&s;e to a new &s;cene of preparation, rather more difficult than that before dinner. My wife and I were di&s;lodged from our own apartment, to make room for our noble gue&s;t. Our four daughters were crammed in by us, and &s;lept on the floor, that their rooms might be left for the two ladies and four of the gentlemen, who were entitled to the degree of re&s;pect; for the remaining two, we found beds at my &s;on-in-law's. My two elde&s;t daugh|ters had, indeed, little time to &s;leep, being clo&s;etted the greate&s;t part of the night with their right honourable vi&s;|itor. My offices were turned top&s;y-turvey for the ac|commodation of the &s;ervants of my gue&s;ts, and my own hor&s;es turned into the fields, that their's might occupy my &s;table.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are hard&s;hips in their kind, Mr. Mirror, which the honour that accompanies them &s;eems to me not fully to compen&s;ate; but the&s;e are &s;light grievances, in com|pari&s;on with what I have to complain of as the effects of this vi&s;it. The malady of my two elde&s;t daughters is not only returned, with increa&s;ed violence, upon them,
<PB N="199" REF="035911_0100_1007BFC70981B740">
but has now communicated it&s;elf to every other branch of my family. My wife, formerly a decent, di&s;creet wo|man, who liked her own way indeed, but was a notable manager, now talks of this and that piece of expen&s;e as nece&s;&s;ary to the rank of a gentlewoman, and has lately dropped &s;ome broad hints, that a winter in town is nece&s;|&s;ary to the accompli&s;hment of one. My two younger daughters have got the <HI>heads</HI> that formerly belonged to their elder &s;i&s;ters, to each of whom, unfortunately, the great Lady pre&s;ented a &s;et of feathers, for which new <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds</HI> were e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of all of them has undergone a very &s;triking metamorpho&s;is, from this one night's in&s;truction of their vi&s;itor. There is, it &s;eems, a fa&s;hion in morality, as well as dre&s;s; and the pre&s;ent mode is not quite &s;o &s;trait-lac'd as the &s;tays are. My two fine ladies talked, a few morn|ings ago, of &s;uch a gentleman's <HI>connexion</HI> with Mi&s;s C&mdash;, and &s;uch another's <HI>arrangement</HI> with Lady G&mdash;, with all the ea&s;e in the world. I &s;ometimes remon&s;trate warm|ly e&s;pecially when I have my &s;on-in-law to bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me, a|gain&s;t the&s;e new-fangled freedoms: but another doctrine they have learned, is, that a father and a par&s;on may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ch as they plea&s;e, but are to be followed only accord|ing to the inclination of their audience.</P>
<P>This contempt of authority, and affectation of fa&s;hion, has gone a &s;tep lower in my hou&s;ehold. My gardener has tied his hair behind, and &s;tolen my flour to powder it, ever &s;ince he &s;aw Mr. Papillot; and ye&s;terday he gave me warning that he &s;hould leave me next term, if I did not take him into the hou&s;e, and provide another hand for the work in the garden. I found a great hoyden, who wa&s;hes my daughters' linens, &s;itting the other after|noon, dre&s;&s;ed in one of their ca&s;t fly-caps, entertaining this &s;ame oaf of a gardener, and the wives of two of my farm-&s;ervants, with tea, for&s;ooth; and when I quarrelled with her for it, &s;he replied, that Mrs. Dimmity, my La|dy's gentlewoman, told her all the maids at&mdash;had tea, and &s;aw company of an afternoon.</P>
<P>But I am re&s;olved on a reformation, Mr. Mirror; and &s;hall let my wife and daughters know, that I will be ma&s;|ter of my own hou&s;e and my own expen&s;es, and will nei|ther

be made a fool nor a beggar, though it were after the manner of the greate&s;t lord in chri&s;tendom. Yet I confe&s;s I am always for trying gentle methods fir&s;t. I beg, therefore, that you will in&s;ert this in your next pa|per, and add to it &s;ome exhortations of your own, to pre|vail on them, if po&s;&s;ible, to give over a behaviour, which I think, under favour, is rather improper even in great folks, but is certainly ruinous to little ones.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.&mdash;TO THE AUTHOR OF THE MIRROR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM one of the young women mentioned in a letter which you publi&s;hed in your 25th number, though I did not know, till very lately, that our family had been put into print in the Mirror. Since it is &s;o, I think I too may venture to write you a letter, which, if it be not quite &s;o well written as my father's, will at lea&s;t be as true.</P>
<P>Soon after my Lady &mdash;'s vi&s;it at our hou&s;e, of which my father's letter informed you, a &s;i&s;ter of his, who is married to a man of bu&s;ine&s;s here in Edinburgh, came with her hu&s;band to &s;ee us in the country; and, though my &s;i&s;ter Mary and I &s;oon di&s;covered many vulgar things about them, yet, as they were both very good-humoured &s;ort of people, and took great pains to make them&s;elves agreeable, we could not help looking with regret to the time of their departure. When that drew near, they &s;urpri&s;ed us, by an invitation to me, to come and &s;pend &s;ome months with my cou&s;ins in town, &s;aying, that my mother could not mi&s;s my company at home, while &s;he had &s;o good a companion and a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the family as her daughter Mary.</P>
<P>To me there were not &s;o many allurements in this journey as might have been imagined. I had lately
<PB N="201" REF="035911_0101_1007C03C2A39B140">
been taught to look on London as the only capital worth vi&s;iting; be&s;ides that, I did not expect the highe&s;t &s;ati&s;|faction from the &s;ociety I &s;hould meet with at my aunt's, which, I confe&s;s, I was apt to &s;uppo&s;e none of the mo&s;t genteel. I contrived to keep the matter in &s;u&s;pen&s;e (for it was left entirely to my own determination) till I &s;hould write for the opinion of my friend, Lady &mdash;, on the &s;ubject; for, ever &s;ince our fir&s;t acquaintance, we had kept up a con&s;tant and regular corre&s;pondence. In our letters, which were always written in a &s;tyle of the warm|e&s;t affection, we were in the way of talking with the greate&s;t freedom of every body of our acquaintance. It was delightful, as her Lady&s;hip expre&s;&s;ed it, "to un|fold one's feelings in the bo&s;om of friend&s;hip." To pre|vent di&s;covery, we corre&s;ponded under &s;ignatures of Horten&s;ia and Leonora; and &s;ome very particular in|telligence her Lady&s;hip taught me not to commit to ink, but to &s;et down in lemon juice. I wander from my &s;to|ry, Mr. Mirror; "but I cannot help fondly recalling (as Emily in the novel &s;ays) tho&s;e halcyon days of friend|&s;hip and felicity."</P>
<P>When her Lady&s;hip's an&s;wer arrived, I found her clearly of opinion that I ought to accept of my aunt's invitation. She was very jocular on the manners which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould find in that Lady's family; but &s;he &s;aid I might take the opportunity of making &s;ome acquirements, which, though London alone could per|fect, Edinburgh might, in &s;ome degree, communicate. She concluded her letter with reque&s;ting the continua|tion of my corre&s;pondence, and a narrative of every thing that was pa&s;&s;ing in town, e&s;pecially with regard to &s;ome ladies and gentlemen of her acquaintance, whom &s;he pointed out to my particular ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>To Edinburgh, therefore, I accompanied my aunt, and found a family very much di&s;po&s;ed to make me happy. In this they might, perhaps, have &s;ucceeded more completely, had I not acquired, from the in&s;truc|tion of Lady &mdash;, and the company I &s;aw at her hou&s;e, certain notions of polite life, with which I did not find any thing at Mr. &mdash;'s, corre&s;pond. It was often, in|deed, their good-humour which offended me as coar&s;e,
<PB N="202" REF="035911_0102_1007BFC8B463FCC0">
and their happine&s;s that &s;truck me as vulgar. There was not &s;uch a thing as hip or low &s;pirits among them, a &s;ort of finery which, at &mdash;, I found a per&s;on of fa&s;h|ion could not po&s;&s;ibly be without.</P>
<P>They were at great pains to &s;hew me any &s;ights that were to be &s;een, with &s;ome of which I was really little plea&s;ed, and with others I thought it would look like ig|norance to &s;eem plea&s;ed. They took me to the play-hou&s;e, where there there was little company, and very little attention. I was carried to the concert, where the ca&s;e was exactly the &s;ame. I found great fault with both; for though I had not much &s;kill, I had got words enough for finding fault from my friend Lady &mdash;: upon which they made an apology for our entertain|ment, by telling me, that the play-hou&s;e was, at that time, managed by a fiddler, and the concert was allowed to manage it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our parties at home were agreeable enough. I found Mr. &mdash;'s and my aunts vi&s;itors very different from what I had been made to expect, and not at all the cock|nies my Lady &mdash; and &s;ome of her humourous gue&s;ts u&s;ed to de&s;cribe. They were not, indeed, &s;o polite as the fa&s;hionable company I had met at her Lady&s;hip's; but they were much more civil. Among the re&s;t was my uncle-in-law's partner, a good looking young man, who, from the fir&s;t, was &s;o particularly attentive to me that my cou&s;ins, jokingly, called him my lover; and even my aunt &s;ometimes told me &s;he believed he had a &s;erious attachment to me; but I took care not to give him any encouragement, as I had always heard my Lady &mdash; talk of the wife of a burgeois as the mo&s;t contemptible creature in the world.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on at la&s;t arrived, in which, I was told, the town would appear in its gaiety, a great deal of good company being expected at the races. For the races I looked with anxiety, for another rea&s;on; my dear La|dy &mdash; was to be here at that period. Of this I was informed by a letter from my &s;i&s;ter. From her Lady|&s;hip I had not heard for a con&s;iderable time, as &s;he had been engaged in a round of vi&s;its to her acquaintance in the country.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="035911_0102_1007BFC8B463FCC0">The very morning after her arrival (for I was on the watch to get intelligence of her) I called at her lodg|ings. When the &s;ervant appeared, he &s;eemed doubtful about letting me in; at la&s;t he u&s;hered me into a little darki&s;h parlour, where, after waiting about half an hour, he brought me word, that his Lady could not try on the gown I had brought then, but de&s;ired me to fetch it next day at eleven. I now perceived there had been a mi&s;|take as to my per&s;on; and telling the fellow, &s;omewhat angrily, that I was no mantua-maker, de&s;ired him to carry to his Lady a &s;lip of paper, on which I wrote with a pencil the well known name of Leonora. On his go|ing up &s;tairs, I heard a loud peal of laughter above, and &s;oon after he returned with a me&s;&s;age, that Lady &mdash; was &s;orry &s;he was particularly engaged at pre&s;ent, and could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee me. Think, Sir, with what a&s;ton|i&s;hment I heard this me&s;&s;age from Horten&s;ia. I left the hou&s;e, I know not whether mo&s;t a&s;hamed or angry; but afterwards I began to per&s;uade my&s;elf, that there might be &s;ome particular rea&s;ons for Lady &mdash;'s not &s;eeing me at that time, which &s;he might explain at meet|ing; and I imputed the terms of the me&s;&s;age to the rude|ne&s;s or &s;implicity of the footman. All that day, and the next, I waited impatiently for the note of explanation or inquiry from her Lady&s;hip, but was a good deal di&s;ap|pointed when I found the &s;econd evening arrive, without having received any &s;uch token of her remembrance. I went, rather in low &s;pirits, to the play. I had not been long in the hou&s;e, when I &s;aw Lady &mdash; enter the next box. My heart fluttered at the &s;ight; and I watched her eyes, that I might take the fir&s;t opportunity of pre|&s;enting my&s;elf to her notice. I &s;aw them &s;oon after turn|ed towards me, and immediately curt&s;ied, with a &s;ignifi|cant &s;mile, to my noble friend, who being &s;hort-&s;ighted, it would &s;eem, which, however, I had never remarked before, &s;tared at me for &s;ome moments, without taking notice of my &s;alute, and at la&s;t was ju&s;t putting up a gla&s;s to her eye, to point it at me, when a lady pulled her by the &s;leeve, and made her take notice of &s;omebody on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the hou&s;e. She never afterwards happened to look to that quarter where I was &s;eated.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="035911_0103_1007BFCB49CCD1D0">Still, however, I was not quite di&s;couraged; and, on an accidental change of places in our box, contrived to place my&s;elf at the end of the bench next her Lady&s;hip's, &s;o that there was only a piece of thin board between us. At the end of the act, I ventured to a&s;k her how &s;he did, and to expre&s;s my happine&s;s at &s;eeing her in town, adding, that I had called the day before, but had found her par|ticularly engaged. "Why yes," &s;aid &s;he, "Mi&s;s Home|&s;pun, I am always extremely hurried in town, and have time to receive only a few vi&s;its; but I will be glad if you will come &s;ome morning and breakfa&s;t with me&mdash;but not to-morrow, for there is a morning concert; nor next day, for I have a mu&s;ical party at home. In &s;hort, you may come &s;ome morning next week, when the hurry will be over, and, if I am not gone out of town, I will be happy to &s;ee you." I don't know what an&s;wer I &s;hould have made; but &s;he did not give me an opportunity; for a gentleman in a green uniform coming into the box, &s;he immediately made room for him to &s;it between us. He, after a broad &s;tare full in my face, turned his back my way, and &s;at in that po&s;ture all the re&s;t of the even|ing.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o &s;illy, Mr. Mirror, but I can under&s;tand the meaning of all this. My Lady, it &s;eems, is contented to have &s;ome humble friends in the country, whom &s;he does not think worthy of her notice in town; but I am determined to &s;hew her, that I have a prouder &s;pirit than &s;he imagines, and &s;hall not go near her, either in town or country. What is more, my father &s;ha'nt vote for her friend at next election, if I can help it.</P>
<P>What vexes me beyond every thing el&s;e, is, that I had often been telling my aunt and her daughters of the in|timate footing. I was on with Lady &mdash;, and what a vi|olent friend&s;hip we had for each other; and &s;o, from en|vy, perhaps, they u&s;ed to nick-name me the counte&s;s, and Lady Leonora. Now that they had got this &s;tory of the mantua-maker and the play-hou&s;e, (for I was &s;o angry I could not conceal it) I am a&s;hamed to hear the name of a lady of quality mentioned, even if it be only in a book from the circulating library. Do write a paper,

<P>IT would be an in&s;ult to your humanity (or perhaps look like it) to apologize for the liberty I am taking. I am one of tho&s;e people, whom the vulgar and illiberal call negroes.

<P>THERE is a &s;trange coincidence, Sancho, in the little events, as well as in the great ones, of this world: for I had been writing a tender tale of the &s;or|rows of a friendle&s;s poor negro girl, and my eyes had &s;carce done &s;marting with it, when your letter of recom|mendation, in behalf of &s;o many of her brethren and &s;i&s;|ters, came to me. But why her brethren, or your's, San|cho, any more than mine? It is by the fine&s;t tints, and mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible gradations, that nature de&s;cends from the faire&s;t face about St. James's, to the &s;ootie&s;t complexion in Africa:&mdash;at which tint of the&s;e is it, that the ties of blood are to cea&s;e? and how many &s;hades mu&s;t we de|&s;cend lower &s;till in the &s;cale, ere mercy is to vani&s;h with them?

<HEAD>LETTER X.&mdash;TO THE AUTHOR OF THE LOUNGER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT di&s;tre&s;s finds &s;ome con&s;olation from revealing its misfortunes, is a trite ob&s;ervation, which perhaps is in no in&s;tance, more &s;trongly felt, than where we have our&s;elves to blame for our calamities. There is &s;omething in making a confe&s;&s;ion, though but on paper, (even if it &s;hould never be communicated to any one) which unloads the mind of a weight, that bears it down in &s;ecret; and though it cannot pluck the thorn from memory, has certainly the effect of blunting its poignan|cy. Suffer me then, Sir, to tell you, or to write as if I were telling you, how unhappy I am, and by what means I have become &s;o.</P>
<P>I was left by my father at the age of thirteen, the elde&s;t of two daughters, under the charge of one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of mothers. Our circum&s;tances were affluent; our &s;ociety re&s;pectable; and our education, from its very commencement, had been attended to with care, and provided for with the utmo&s;t liberality. No in&s;truction was neglected, no accompli&s;hment unattended to. In attaining the&s;e, my &s;i&s;ter was not quite &s;o fortu|nate as I. Born, as I have been often told, with un|common quickne&s;s of parts, I found no difficulty in ma&s;|tering the &s;tudies that were taught me, or of acquiring the embelli&s;hments it was wi&s;hed I &s;hould acquire. My &s;i&s;ter was often deficient in the one and awkward at the other. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, however, a &s;ound, plain under|&s;tanding, and an excellent temper. My &s;uperiority nev|er excited envy in her, and I think never vanity in me. We loved one another mo&s;t &s;incerely; and after &s;ome years had blunted the grief, which my mother felt for her hu&s;band's death, there were, I believe, few happier families than our's.</P>
<P>Though our affections were cordial, however, our di&s;|po&s;itions were very different. My &s;i&s;ter was contented to
<PB N="211" REF="035911_0106_1007BFD3E4D411F0">
think as other people thought, and to feel as other peo|ple felt; &s;he rarely ventured to &s;peculate in opinion, or to &s;oar in fancy. I was often tempted to reject, if not to de&s;pi&s;e the common opinions of mankind, and to cre|ate to my&s;elf a warm, and, I am afraid, a vi&s;ionary pic|ture of happine&s;s, ari&s;ing from a highly refined &s;en&s;ibil|ity. My mother was at pains to di&s;courage the&s;e enthu|&s;ia&s;tic ideas, and to repre&s;ent the danger of indulging in them. From a de&s;ire, perhaps, of overcoming that ten|dency towards them which &s;he perceived in me, her di&s;|cour&s;e, when we were alone, almo&s;t con&s;tantly turned on this &s;ubject. As &s;he always allowed us the liberty of ar|gument with her, I &s;tood up, in the&s;e conver&s;ations, the warm defender of my own maxims, in contradiction to tho&s;e prudent ones, which &s;he recommended. Her's, I am per&s;uaded, admitted of better rea&s;oning; but my cau&s;e gave greater room for eloquence. All my little talents were exerted in the conte&s;t; and I have often &s;ince thought that my mother had, from nature, a bent to my &s;ide of the que&s;tion, which all her wi&s;dom and expe|rience had not been able to overcome; that though &s;he con&s;tantly applauded the prudent &s;y&s;tem of my &s;i&s;ter, &s;he was, in truth, rather partial to mine, and vain of that ability with which I defended it: however that might be, I my&s;elf always aro&s;e from the di&s;pute more and more convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of my own opinions, and proud of that &s;uperiority which I thought they conferred on me.</P>
<P>We had not long attained a marriageable age, when we found our&s;elves &s;urrounded with tho&s;e whom the world terms admirers. Our mother's benevolence and &s;weetne&s;s of temper inclined her to &s;ociety, and we were too innocent for prudery; we had, therefore, a number of vi&s;itors of the other &s;ex, many of whom were &s;o par|ticular in their attentions, that women who wi&s;hed to boa&s;t of conque&s;ts, would have called them lovers. With us they did not always a&s;&s;ume that title; my &s;i&s;ter was too prudent, and I was too nice, ea&s;ily to believe a man a lover.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e, however, were two gentlemen, who&s;e attachment was declared to me in terms too &s;trong to be
<PB N="212" REF="035911_0107_1007BFD732404DB8">
mi&s;under&s;tood. Florio's per&s;on was univer&s;ally allowed to be hand&s;ome; many, of whom I was one, thought it elegant. With external accompli&s;hment his education had furni&s;hed him; his manner was ea&s;y and unembar|ra&s;&s;ed; &s;ome called it a&s;&s;uming, I thought it natural. His conver&s;ation was full of the language of &s;en&s;ibility; in my idea it &s;poke a mind replete with &s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf. Other people &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected him of &s;hallowne&s;s and affectation; I prai&s;ed him for avoiding the pedantry of knowledge, and the ru&s;ticity of men proud of its acquire|ments.</P>
<P>Alcander was the only &s;on of a particular friend of my mother, and therefore on a very intimate footing in our family. My mother, with whom he was a favourite, di&s;covered in him a great fund of good &s;en&s;e and u&s;eful knowledge. I was &s;truck with the inelegance of his appearance and addre&s;s, and the want of refinement in his &s;entiments and conver&s;ation. His goodne&s;s and candour were often the topics of my mother's commendation; I remarked his want of di&s;cernment, and the coldne&s;s of his attachments and aver&s;ions. My mother often repeat|ed her own eulogiums of Alcander, and the critici&s;ms of the world on Florio; I always heard her with a deter|mined oppo&s;ition of &s;entiment, and therefore aro&s;e from the conver&s;ation more aver&s;e to the fir&s;t, and more attach|ed to the latter. Alcander, after per&s;i&s;ting for &s;ome time under a very marked di&s;inclination to him, gave up the pur&s;uit; but as he &s;till continued his vi&s;its to the family, particularly during any occa&s;ional ab&s;ence of mine, he transferred by degrees his affections to my &s;i&s;ter. When he had cea&s;ed to be my lover, I was very willing to be ve|ry much his friend: my mother had always &s;hewn her partiality in his favour; my &s;i&s;ter was won by his vir|tues, and after &s;ome time became his wife.</P>
<P>Florio's &s;uit to me was oppo&s;ed by my mother, with rather more vehemence than was natural to her. She oft|en in&s;i&s;ted on the infatuation, as &s;he called it, of that de|ception which I was under, with regard to him; a de|ception which &s;he predicted I &s;hould one day be convinc|ed of. Her oppo&s;ition, however, though it over-ruled my conduct, never overcame my attachment: I would
<PB N="213" REF="035911_0107_1007BFD732404DB8">
not be his without the con&s;ent of my mother; but my affection it was not in her power to &s;hake. Her love for me overcame her re&s;olution; and at la&s;t &s;he gave, how|ever unwillingly, my hand to Florio.</P>
<P>I was now the happie&s;t of women. The &s;cenes I had often pictured of conjugal tenderne&s;s and dome&s;tic hap|pine&s;s, I thought now realized in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a man, who, I had taught my&s;elf to believe, was to love me for|ever, and was him&s;elf every thing I ought to love; and I often looked with a degree of pity on the &s;ituation of my &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e happine&s;s (for &s;he called it happine&s;s) with Alcander was of a kind &s;o inferior to mine.</P>
<P>How long this la&s;ted I cannot exactly &s;ay. I fear I began to be unhappy long before I would allow my&s;elf to believe it. I have often wept alone at the coldne&s;s and neglect of Florio, when on meeting him, a few words of &s;eeming tenderne&s;s and affection made me again re|proach my doubts of his love, and think my own &s;itua|tion the mo&s;t enviable of any. Alas! he at length drove me from this la&s;t &s;trong hold, in which my affec|tion for him had entrenched it&s;elf. It is now three years &s;ince he has treated me in &s;uch a manner as to leave no apology for his treatment. During the la&s;t, my mother's death has deprived me of one of the few com|forts I had left. From my mother I carefully concealed my di&s;tre&s;s; but I believe in vain: &s;he lived to gue&s;s at my mi&s;ery; and I fear her &s;en&s;e of it added to the pre&s;|&s;ure of that which brought her to the grave.</P>
<P>After the lo&s;s of my hu&s;band's love, it is little to talk of my di&s;appointment in his talents and accompli&s;hments. It was long, however, before I allowed my&s;elf to &s;ee defects, which le&s;s penetration than I have been flattered with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d long before di&s;covered. My mother had often, before our marriage, expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e that one of my abilities &s;hould be &s;o deceived, as not to &s;ee his inferiority. I believe it is by the&s;e abilities that the deception is aided: they are able to form a picture to which more ordinary minds are unequal; and in the weakne&s;s of their ra&s;h attachment, they find the likene&s;s where they wi&s;h to find it.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="035911_0108_1007BFD8C4A6BC20">I was interrupted by my &s;i&s;ter. Why are her looks &s;o &s;erene? and why does &s;he tell me how much mine are altered? I am too proud to allow a witne&s;s to my di&s;|tre&s;&s;es; and from her, of all womankind, I would con|ceal them. This di&s;&s;imulation is due to my pride, per|haps to my duty; yet if you knew, Sir, what it is to &s;mile in public, to &s;eem to be happy with &s;uch feelings as mine; to act contentment all day long, and retire at night to my lonely pillow, with the angui&s;h my heart has trea&s;ured up all the while!&mdash;but the &s;ubject over|powers me!&mdash;Farewel.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY fair companion &s;till improves in my e&s;|teem; the more I know her mind, her beauty becomes more poignant; &s;he appears charming even among the daughters of Circa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ia.</P>
<P>Yet were I to examine her beauty with the art of a &s;tatuary, I &s;hould find numbers here, that far &s;urpa&s;s her; nature has not granted her all the boa&s;ted Circa&s;&s;ian reg|ularity of feature, and yet &s;he greatly exceeds the faire&s;t of the country, in the art of &s;eizing the affections. Whence, I have often &s;aid to my&s;elf, this re&s;i&s;tle&s;s magic, that attends even moderate charms? Though I regard the beauties of the country with admiration, every inter|view weakens the impre&s;&s;ion; but the form of Zelis grows upon my imagination: I never behold her without an increa&s;e of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect. Whence this inju&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the mind in preferring imperfect beauty to that which nature &s;eems to have fini&s;hed with care? Whence the in|fatuation, that he, whom a comet could not amaze, &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed at a meteor? When rea&s;on was thus fatigued to find an an&s;wer, my imagination pur&s;ued the &s;ubject, and this was the re&s;ult&mdash;I fancied my&s;elf placed between two land&s;capes, this called the region of beauty, and that the valley of the graces; the one embelli&s;hed with all that
<PB N="215" REF="035911_0108_1007BFD8C4A6BC20">
luxuriant nature could be&s;tow; the fruits of various cli|mates adorned the trees; the grove re&s;ounded with mu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">; the gale breathed perfume; every charm that could ari&s;e from &s;ymmetry and exact di&s;tribution were here con&s;picuous; the whole offering a pro&s;pect of plea&s;ure without end. The valley of the graces, on the other hand, &s;eemed by no means &s;o inviting; the &s;treams and the groves appeared ju&s;t as they u&s;ually do in frequented countries: no magnificent parterres; no concert in the grove: the rivulet was edged with weeds; and the rook joined its voice to that of the nightingale. All was &s;im|plicity and nature.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;triking objects ever fir&s;t allure the traveller. I entered the region of beauty with increa&s;ed curio&s;ity, and promi&s;ed my&s;elf endle&s;s &s;atisfaction, in being intro|duced to the pre&s;iding godde&s;s. I perceived &s;everal &s;tran|gers, who entered with the &s;ame de&s;ign; and what &s;ur|pri&s;ed me not a little, was to &s;ee &s;everal others ha&s;tening to leave this abode of &s;eeming felicity.</P>
<P>After &s;ome fatigue, I had at la&s;t the honour of being introduced to the godde&s;s, who repre&s;ented beauty in per|&s;on. She was &s;eated on a throne, at the foot of which &s;tood &s;everal &s;trangers lately introduced like me, all gaz|ing on her form with exta&s;y. "Ah what eyes! what lips! how clear her complexion! how perfect her &s;hape!" At the&s;e exclamations, beauty with downca&s;t eyes, would endeavour to counterfeit mode&s;ty, but &s;oon again looking round as if to confirm every &s;pectator in his favourable &s;entiments, &s;ometimes &s;he would attempt to allure us by &s;miles; and at intervals would bridle back, in order to in&s;pire us with re&s;pect as well as tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>This ceremony la&s;ted for &s;ome time, and had &s;o much employed our eyes, that we forgot all this while that the godde&s;s was &s;ilent. We &s;oon, however, began to per|ceive the defect: "What," &s;aid we, among each other, "are we to have nothing but langui&s;hing airs, &s;oft looks, and inclinations of the head? will the godde&s;s only deign to &s;atisfy our eyes?" Upon this, one of the company &s;tepped up to pre&s;ent her with &s;ome fruits he had gather|ed by the way. She received the pre&s;ent, mo&s;t &s;weetly &s;miling, and with one of the white&s;t hands in the world; but &s;till not a word e&s;caped her lips.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="035911_0109_1007BFDAD0842E10">I now found that my companions grew weary of their homage; they went off one by one; and, re&s;olving not to be left behind, I offered to go in my turn; when ju&s;t at the door of the temple, I was called back by a female, who&s;e name was Pride, and who &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed with the behaviour of the company. "Where are you ha&s;t|ening?" &s;aid &s;he to me, with an angry air, "the godde&s;s of beauty is here." I have been to vi&s;it her, Madam, replied I, and I find her more beautiful even than report had made her. "And why then will you leave her?" added the female. I have &s;een her long enough, return|ed I; I have got all her features by heart. Her eyes are &s;till the &s;ame. Her no&s;e is a very fine one, but it is &s;till ju&s;t &s;uch a no&s;e now as it was half an hour ago: could &s;he throw a little more mind into her face, per|haps I &s;hould be for wi&s;hing to have more of her com|pany. "What &s;ignifies," replied my female, "whether &s;he has a mind or not; has &s;he any occa&s;ion for a mind, &s;o formed as &s;he is by nature? If &s;he had a common face, indeed, there might be &s;ome rea&s;on for thinking to improve it; but when features are already perfect, every alteration would but impair them. A fine face is already at the point of perfection, and a fine lady &s;hould endea|vour to keep it &s;o; the impre&s;&s;ion it would receive from thought, would but di&s;turb its whole economy."</P>
<P>To this &s;peech I gave no reply, but made the be&s;t of my way to the valley of the graces. Here I found all tho&s;e, who before had been my companions in the region of beauty, now upon the &s;ame errand.</P>
<P>As we entered the valley, the pro&s;pect in&s;en&s;ibly &s;eem|ed to improve; we found every thing &s;o natural, &s;o do|me&s;tic and plea&s;ing, that our minds, which before were congealed in admiration, now relaxed into gaiety and good humour. We had de&s;igned to pay our re&s;pects to the pre&s;iding godde&s;s, but &s;he was no where to be found. One of our companions a&s;&s;erted, that her temple lay to the right; another to the left; a third in&s;i&s;ted that it was &s;traight before us; and a fourth that we had left it behind. In &s;hort, we found every thing familiar and charming, but could not determine where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;eek for the grace in per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="035911_0109_1007BFDAD0842E10">In this agreeable incertitude we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal hours; and, though very de&s;irous of finding the godde&s;s, by no means impatient of the delay. Every part of the valley pre&s;ented &s;ome minute beauty, which, without offering it&s;elf, at once &s;tole upon the &s;oul, and captivated us with the charms of our retreat. Still, however, we continued to &s;earch, and might &s;till have continued, had we not been interrupted by a voice, which, though we could not &s;ee from whence it came, addre&s;&s;ed us in this manner:</P>
<P>"If you would find the godde&s;s of grace, &s;eek her not under one form, for &s;he a&s;&s;umes a thou&s;and. Ever chang|ing under the eye of in&s;pection, her variety, rather than her figure, is plea&s;ing. In contemplating her beauty, the eye glides over every perfection with giddy delight, and capable of fixing no where, is charmed with the whole. She is now contemplation with &s;olemn look, again com|pa&s;&s;ion with humid eye; &s;he now &s;parkles with joy, her countenance beaming with &s;en&s;ibility; &s;oon every feature &s;peaks di&s;tre&s;s; her looks at times invite our approach, at others repre&s;s our pre&s;umption; the godde&s;s cannot be properly called beautiful under any one of the&s;e forms, but, by combining them all, &s;he becomes irre&s;i&s;tibly plea&s;ing."

<HEAD>LETTER XII.&mdash;TO THE RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have very lately ob&s;erved that, in the numerous &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the world, every cla&s;s and or|der of mankind have joys and &s;orrows of their own; we all feel hourly pain and plea&s;ure from events which pa&s;s unheeded before other eyes, but can &s;carcely communi|cate our perceptions to minds pre-occupied by different objects, any more than the delight of well-di&s;po&s;ed col|ours or harmonious &s;ounds can be imparted to &s;uch as want the &s;en&s;es of hearing or of &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="035911_0110_1007BFDC9739C148">I am &s;o &s;trongly convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this re|mark, and have on &s;o many occa&s;ions di&s;covered with how little attention pride looks upon calamity of which &s;he thinks her&s;elf not in danger, and indolence li&s;tens to complaint when it is not echoed by her own remem|brance, that though I am about to lay the occurrences of my life before you, I que&s;tion whether you will con|de&s;cend to peru&s;e my narrative, or without the help of &s;ome female &s;peculati&s;t, be able to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>I was born a beauty. From the dawn of my rea&s;on I had my regard turned wholly upon my&s;elf; nor can I recollect any thing earlier than prai&s;e and admiration. My mother, who&s;e face had luckily advanced her to a condition above her birth, thought no evil &s;o great as de|formity. She had not the power of imagining any oth|er defect than a cloudy complexion, or di&s;proportionate features; and therefore contemplated me as an a&s;&s;em|blage of all that could rai&s;e envy or de&s;ire, and predict|ed, with triumphant fondne&s;s, the extent of my conque&s;ts, and the number of my &s;laves.</P>
<P>She never mentioned any of my young acquaintance before me, but to remark how much they fell below my perfection; how one would have had a fine face but that her eyes were without lu&s;tre; how another &s;truck the &s;ight at a di&s;tance, but wanted my hair and teeth at a nearer view; another di&s;graced an elegant &s;hape with a a brown &s;kin; &s;ome had &s;hort fingers, and others dim|ples in a wrong place.</P>
<P>As &s;he expected no happine&s;s nor advantage but from beauty, &s;he thought nothing but beauty worthy of her care; and her maternal kindne&s;s was chiefly exerci&s;ed in contrivances to protect me from any accident, that might deface me with a &s;car, or &s;tain me with a freckle: &s;he never thought me &s;ufficiently &s;haded from the &s;un, or &s;creened from the fire. She was &s;evere or indulgent with no other intention than the pre&s;ervation of my form: &s;he excu&s;ed me from work, le&s;t I &s;hould learn to hang down my head, or harden my finger with a needle: &s;he &s;natched away my book, becau&s;e a young lady in the neighbourhood had made her eyes red, with reading by a candle; but &s;he would &s;carce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;uffer me to eat, le&s;t I

&s;hould &s;poil my &s;hape; nor to walk, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;well my ancle with a &s;prain. At night I was accurately &s;urveyed from head to foot, le&s;t I &s;hould have &s;uffered any dimi|nution of my charms in the adventures of the day; and was never permitted to &s;leep, till I had pa&s;&s;ed through the co&s;metic di&s;cipline, part of which was a regular lu&s;tration performed with bean-flower water and may-dews; my hair was perfumed with variety of unguents, by &s;ome of which it was to be thickened, and by others to be curled. The &s;oftne&s;s of my hands was &s;ecured by medicated gloves, and my bo&s;om rubbed with a pomade prepared by my mother, of virtue to di&s;cu&s;s pimples, and clear di&s;colorations.</P>
<P>I was always called up early, becau&s;e the morning air gives a fre&s;hne&s;s to the cheeks; but I was placed behind a curtain in my mother's chamber, becau&s;e the neck is ea&s;ily tanned by the ri&s;ing &s;un. I was then dre&s;&s;ed with a thou&s;and precautions, and again heard my own prai&s;es, and triumphed in the compliments and progno&s;tications of all that approached me.</P>
<P>My mother was not &s;o much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opin|ion of my natural excellencies as not to think &s;ome cultiva|tion nece&s;&s;ary to their completion. She took care that I &s;hould want none of the accompli&s;hments included in fe|male education, or con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary in fa&s;hionable life. I was looked upon in my ninth year as the chief ornament of the dancing-ma&s;ter's ball; and Mr. Ariet u&s;ed to reproach his other &s;cholars with my performances on the harp&s;ichord. At twelve, I was remarkable for playing my cards with great elegance of manner, and accuracy of judgment.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the time arrived when my mother thought me perfect in my exerci&s;es, and qualified to di&s;play, in the open world, tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which had yet been only di&s;covered in &s;elect parties, or dome&s;tic a&s;&s;emblies. Preparations were therefore made for my appearance on a public night, which &s;he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t impor|tant and critical moment of my life. She cannot be charged with neglecting any means of recommendation, or leaving any thing to chance, which prudence could a&s;certain. Every ornament was tried in every po&s;ition
<PB N="220" REF="035911_0111_1007BFE016E7E058">
every friend was con&s;ulted about the colour of my dre&s;s; and the mantua-makers were hara&s;&s;ed with directions and alterations.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the night arrived, from which my future life was to be reckoned. I was dre&s;&s;ed and &s;ent out to con|quer, with a heart beating like that of an old knight-er|rant at his fir&s;t &s;ally. Scholars have told me of a Spar|tan matron, who, when &s;he armed her &s;on for battle, bade him bring back his &s;hield or be brought upon it. My venerable parent di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me to a field, in her opinion of equal glory, with a command to &s;hew that I was her daughter, and not to return without a lover.</P>
<P>I went, and was received like other plea&s;ing novel|ties, with a tumult of applau&s;e. Every man, who val|ued him&s;elf upon the graces of his per&s;on, or the ele|gance of his addre&s;s, crowded about me, and wit and &s;plendour contended for my notice. I was delightfully fatigued with ince&s;&s;ant civilities, which were made more plea&s;ing by the apparent envy of tho&s;e, whom my pre&s;|ence expo&s;ed to neglect, and returned with an attendant equal in rank and wealth to my utmo&s;t wi&s;hes, and from this time &s;tood in the fir&s;t rank of beauty, was followed by gazers in the Mall, celebrated in the papers of the day, imitated by all who endeavoured to ri&s;e into fa&s;hion, and cen&s;ured by tho&s;e whom age or di&s;appointment forced to retire.</P>
<P>My mother, who plea&s;ed her&s;elf with the hopes of &s;ee|ing my exaltation, dre&s;&s;ed me with all the exuberance of finery; and when I repre&s;ented to her that a fortune might be expected proportionate to my appearance, told me that &s;he &s;hould &s;corn the reptile, who could inquire after the fortune of a girl like me. She advi&s;ed me to pro&s;ecute my victories, and time would certainly bring me a cap|tive, who might de&s;erve the honour of being enchained forever.</P>
<P>My lovers were indeed &s;o numerous, that I had no other care than that of determining to whom I &s;hould &s;eem to give the preference. But having been &s;teadily and indu&s;triou&s;ly in&s;tructed to pre&s;erve my heart from any impre&s;&s;ions which might hinder me from con&s;ulting my intere&s;t, I acted with le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ment, becau&s;e my
<PB N="221" REF="035911_0111_1007BFE016E7E058">
choice was regulated by principles more clear and certain than the caprice of approbation. When I had &s;ingled out one from the re&s;t as more worthy of encouragement, I proceeded in my mea&s;ures by the rules of art; and yet, when the ardour of the fir&s;t vi&s;its was &s;pent, gene|rally found a &s;udden declen&s;ion of my influence: I felt in my&s;elf the want of &s;ome power to diver&s;ify amu&s;e|ment, and enliven conver&s;ation; and could not but &s;u&s;|pect that my mind failed in performing the promi&s;es of my face. This opinion was &s;oon confirmed by one of my lovers, who married Lavinia with le&s;s beauty and fortune than mine, becau&s;e he thought a wife ought to have qualities, which might make her amiable when her bloom was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I had now completed my nineteenth year: if my charms had lo&s;t any of their &s;oftne&s;s, it was more than compen&s;ated by additional dignity; and if the attrac|tions of innocence were impaired, their place was &s;up|plied by the arts of allurement. I was therefore pre|paring for a new attack, without any abatement of my confidence, when in the mid&s;t of my hopes and &s;chemes, I was &s;eized with that dreadful malady, which has &s;o oft|en put a &s;udden end to the tyranny of beauty. I re|covered my health after a long confinement; but when I looked again on that face, which had often been flu&s;h|ed with tran&s;port at its own reflection, and &s;aw all that I had learned to value, all that I had endeavoured to im|prove, all that had procured me honours or prai&s;es, irre|coverably de&s;troyed, I &s;unk at once into melancholy and de&s;pondence. My pain was not much con&s;oled or alleviated by my mother, who grieved that I had not lo&s;t my life together with my beauty.</P>
<P>Having thus continued my relation to the period from which my life took a new cour&s;e, I &s;hall conclude it in another letter, if by publi&s;hing this you &s;how any regard to the corre&s;pondence of,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.&mdash;TO THE RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have &s;hewn, by the publication of my letter, that you think the life of Victoria not wholly un|worthy of the notice of a philo&s;opher: I &s;hall therefore continue my narrative, without apology for unimpor|tance which you have dignified, or for inaccuracies which you are to correct.</P>
<P>When my life appeared to be no longer in danger, and as much of my &s;trength was recovered as enabled me to bear the agitation of a coach, I was placed at a lodging in a neighbouring village, to which my mother di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with a faint embrace, having repeated her command not to expo&s;e my face too &s;oon to the &s;un or wind, and told me, that with care I might perhaps be|come tolerable again. The pro&s;pect of becoming tol|erable had very little power to elevate the imagination of one, who had &s;o long been accu&s;tomed to prai&s;e and exta&s;y; but it was &s;ome &s;atisfaction to be &s;eparated from my mother, who was ince&s;&s;antly ringing the knell of de|parted beauty, and never entered my room without the whine of condolence, or the growl of anger. She often wandered over my face, as do travellers over the ruins of a celebrated city, to note every place which had once been remarkable for a happy feature. She conde&s;cend|ed to vi&s;it my retirement, but always left me more mel|ancholy; for after a thou&s;and trifling inquiries about my diet, and a minute examination of my looks, &s;he gener|ally concluded with a &s;igh, that I &s;hould never more be fit to be &s;een.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I was permitted to return home, but found no great improvement of my condition; for I was impri&s;|oned in my chamber as a criminal, who&s;e appearance would di&s;grace my friends, and condemned to be tor|tured into new beauty. Every experiment which the officiou&s;ne&s;s of folly could communicate, or the credu|lity of ignorance admit, was tried upon me. Sometimes
<PB N="223" REF="035911_0112_1007BFE3EDE592A0">
I was covered with emollients, by which it was expected that all the &s;cars would be filled, and my cheeks plump|ed up to their former &s;moothne&s;s; and &s;ometimes I was puni&s;hed with artificial excoriations, in hopes of gaining new graces with a new &s;kin. The co&s;metic &s;cience was, exhau&s;ted upon me; but who can repair the ruins of na|ture? My mother was forced to give me re&s;t at la&s;t, and abandon me to the fate of a fallen toa&s;t, who&s;e fortune &s;he con&s;idered as a hopele&s;s game, no longer worthy of &s;olicitude or attention.</P>
<P>I was &s;o little able to find entertainment for my&s;elf, that I was forced in a &s;hort time to venture abroad, as the &s;olitary &s;avage is driven by hunger from his den. I entered with all the humility of di&s;grace into a&s;&s;emblies, where I had lately &s;parkled with gaiety, and towered with triumph. I was not wholly without hope, that de|jection had mi&s;repre&s;ented me to my&s;elf, and that the re|mains of my former face might yet have &s;ome attraction and influence: but the fir&s;t circle of vi&s;its convinced me, that my reign was at an end; that life and death were no longer in my hands; that I was no more to practi&s;e the glance of command, or the frown of prohibition, to receive the tribute of &s;ighs and prai&s;es, or to be &s;oothed with the gentle murmurs of amorous timidity. My opin|ion was now unheard, and my propo&s;als were unregard|ed; the narrowne&s;s of my knowledge, and the meanne&s;s of my &s;entiments, were ea&s;ily di&s;covered, when the eyes were no longer engaged again&s;t the judgment; and it was ob&s;erved, by tho&s;e who had formerly been charmed with my vivacious loquacity, that my under&s;tanding was impaired as well as my face, and that I was no longer qualified to fill a place in any company but a party at cards.</P>
<P>Though the negligence of the men was not very plea&s;|ing, when compared with vows and adoration, yet it was far more &s;upportable than the in&s;olence of my own &s;ex. For the fir&s;t ten months after my return into the world, I never entered a &s;ingle hou&s;e, in which the memory of my downfall was not revived. At one place I was con|gratulated on my e&s;cape with life; at another I heard of the benefits of early inoculation; by &s;ome I have been
<PB N="224" REF="035911_0113_1007BFE587ECE670">
told in expre&s;s terms, that I am not yet without my charms; others have whi&s;pered, at my entrance&mdash;This is the celebrated beauty. One told me of a wa&s;h that would &s;mooth the &s;kin; and another offered me her chair that I might not front the light. Some &s;oothed me with the ob&s;ervation that none can tell how &s;oon her ca&s;e may be my own; and &s;ome thought it proper to re|ceive me with mournful tenderne&s;s, formal condolence, and con&s;olatory blandi&s;hments.</P>
<P>Thus was I every day hara&s;&s;ed with all the &s;tratagems of well-bred malignity; yet in&s;olence was more tolerable than &s;olitude, and I therefore per&s;i&s;ted to keep my time at the doors of my acquaintance, without gratifying them with any appearance of re&s;entment or depre&s;&s;ion. I ex|pected that their exultation would in time vapour away; that the joy of their &s;uperiority would end with its novel|ty; and that I &s;hould be &s;uffered to glide along in my pre&s;ent form among the namele&s;s multitude whom nature never intended to excite envy or admiration, nor enable to delight the eye or inflame the heart.</P>
<P>This was naturally to be expected, and this I began to experience. But when I was no longer agitated by the perpetual ardour of re&s;i&s;tance and effort of per&s;everance, I found more &s;en&s;ibly the want of tho&s;e entertainments, which had formerly delighted me: the day ro&s;e upon me without an engagement; and the evening clo&s;ed in its natural gloom, without &s;ummoning to a concert or a ball. None had any care to find amu&s;ements for me, and I had no power of amu&s;ing my&s;elf. Idlene&s;s expo&s;|ed me to melancholy, and life began to langui&s;h in mo|tionle&s;s indifference.</P>
<P>Mi&s;ery and &s;hame are nearly allied. It was not without many &s;truggles that I prevailed on my&s;elf to confe&s;s my unea&s;ine&s;s to Euphemia, the only friend who had never pained me with comfort or with pity. I at la&s;t laid my calamities before her, rather to ea&s;e my heart than to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><Q>We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h, (&s;aid &s;he) my Victoria, tho&s;e evils which are impo&s;ed by Providence, from tho&s;e to which we our&s;elves give the power of hurting us. Of your calamity, a &s;mall part is the infliction of Heaven,
<PB N="225" REF="035911_0113_1007BFE587ECE670">
the re&s;t is little more than the corro&s;ion of idle di&s;con|tent. You have lo&s;t that which may indeed &s;ometimes contribute to happine&s;s, but to which happine&s;s is by no means in&s;eparably annexed. You have lo&s;t what the greater part of the human race never have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; what tho&s;e on whom it is be&s;towed for the mo&s;t part po&s;&s;e&s;s in vain; and what you, while it was your's, knew not how to u&s;e: you have only lo&s;t early what the laws of nature forbid you to keep long, and have lo&s;t it while your mind is yet flexible, and while you have time to &s;ub&s;titute more valuable and more durable excellencies. Con&s;ider your&s;elf, my Victoria, as a being born to know, to rea&s;on, and to act: ri&s;e at once from your dream of melancholy to wi&s;dom and to piety; you will find that there are other charms than tho&s;e of beauty, and other joys than the prai&s;e of fools.</Q></P>

<P>LITTLE Sally Meanwell had one day been to pay an afternoon's vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Harriet, the daughter of Sir Thomas Pemberton. The evening proving rainy, &s;he was &s;ent home in Sir Thomas's coach; and on her return, the following conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between her and her mother.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Meanwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear, I hope you have had a plea&s;ant vi&s;it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, mamma, very plea&s;ant; you cannot think what a great many fine things I have &s;een. And then it is &s;o charming to ride in a coach!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Mi&s;s Harriet &s;hewed you all her play-things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, &s;uch fine large dolls, &s;o &s;martly dre&s;&s;ed, as I never &s;aw in my life before. Then &s;he has a baby-hou&s;e and all &s;orts of furniture in it; and a grotto all made of &s;hells, and &s;hining &s;tones. And then &s;he &s;hewed me all her fine clothes for the next ball: there's a white &s;lip all full of &s;pangles, and pink ribbons; you can't think how beautiful it looks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what did you admire mo&s;t of all the&s;e fine things?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know&mdash;I admired them all; and I think I liked riding in the coach better than all the re&s;t. Why don't we keep a coach, mamma? and why have not I &s;uch fine clothes and play-things as Mi&s;s Harriet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e we cannot afford it, my dear. Your papa is not &s;o rich, by a great deal as Sir Thomas; and if we were to lay out our money upon &s;uch things, we &s;hould not be able to procure food and raiment and other nece&s;&s;aries for you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why is not papa as rich as Sir Thomas?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Sir Thomas had a large e&s;tate left him by his father, but your papa has little but what he gains by his own indu&s;try.</P>

<P>Are there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to be &s;ure. Don't you know what a number of poor people there are all around us, who have very few of the comforts we enjoy? What do you think of Plowman the labourer? I believe you never &s;aw him idle in your life.</P>

<P>O, no! they are &s;o dirty and ragged.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I am afraid they often do not get as much victuals as they could eat. And then, in winter, they mu&s;t be half &s;tarved for want of fire and warm cloathing. How do you think you could bear all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I don't know. But I have &s;een Plow|man's wife carry great brown loaves into the hou&s;e; and I remember once eating &s;ome brown bread and milk, and I thought it very good.</P>

<P>I believe you would not much like it con|&s;tantly: be&s;ides, they can hardly get enough of that. But you &s;eem to know almo&s;t as little of the poor as the young French Prince&s;s did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that, mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there had been one year &s;o bad a harve&s;t in France, that numbers of the poor were fami&s;h|ed to death. This calamity was &s;o much talked of, that it reached the Court, and was mentioned before the young Prince&s;&s;es. Dear me! &s;aid one of them, how &s;il|ly that was! Why, rather than be fami&s;hed, I would eat bread and chee&s;e. Her governe&s;s was then obliged to acquaint her, that the greate&s;t part of her father's &s;ubject's &s;carcely ever eat any thing better than black bread all their lives; and that va&s;t numbers would now think them&s;elves very happy to get only their u&s;ual pit|tance of that. Such wretchedne&s;s as this was what the Prince&s;s had not the lea&s;t idea of; and the account &s;hocked her &s;o much, that &s;he was glad to &s;acrifice all her finery to afford &s;ome relief to the &s;ufferings of the poor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope there is nobody fami&s;hed in our country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not; for we have laws by which ev|ery per&s;on is entitled to relief from the pari&s;h, if he is unable to gain a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and were there no laws about it, I am &s;ure it would be our duty to part with every &s;uperfluity rather than let a fellow-creature peri&s;h for want of nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then do you think it was wrong for Mi&s;s Pem|berton to have all tho&s;e fine things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, if they are &s;uitable to her fortune, and do not con&s;ume the money which ought to be employed in more u&s;eful things for her&s;elf and others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why might &s;he not be contented with &s;uch things as I have; and give the money that the re&s;t co&s;t to the poor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e &s;he can afford to be both charitable to the poor, and al&s;o to indulge her&s;elf in the&s;e plea&s;ures. But do you recollect, that the children of Mr. White, the

<P>Are you not as much better dre&s;&s;ed, and as much more plentifully &s;upplied with play-things than they are, as Mi&s;s Pemberton is than you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, I believe I am; for I remember Polly White was very glad of one of my old dolls; and Nancy Shape cried for &s;uch a &s;a&s;h as mine, but her mother would not let her have one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you &s;ee, my dear, that there are ma|ny who have fewer things to be thankful for than you have; and you may al&s;o learn what ought to be the true mea&s;ure of the expectations of children, and the indulgen|cies of parents.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't quite under&s;tand you, mamma.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing ought to be &s;uited to the &s;tation in which we live, or are likely to live, and the wants and duties of it. Your papa and I do not grudge laying out part of our money to promote the innocent plea&s;ure of our children; but it would be very wrong in us to lay out &s;o much on this account as would oblige us to &s;pare in more nece&s;&s;ary articles, as in their education, and the common hou&s;ehold expen&s;es required in our way of liv|ing. Be&s;ides, it would be &s;o far from making y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> hap|pier, that it would be doing you the greate&s;t injury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could that be, mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you were now to be dre&s;&s;ed like Mi&s;s Pemberton, don't you think you &s;hould be greatly mor|tified at being wor&s;e dre&s;&s;ed, when you come to be a young woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I &s;hould, mamma; for then perhaps I might go to a&s;&s;emblies; and to be &s;ure I &s;hould like to be as &s;mart then as at any time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but it would be &s;till more improper for us to dre&s;s you then beyond our circum&s;tances, be|cau&s;e your nece&s;&s;ary clothes will then co&s;t more, you know. Then if we were to hire a coach or chair for you to go a vi&s;iting in, &s;hould you like to leave it off ever af|terwards?

<P>Eliza then, pale and trembling, &s;tood by her mother, and &s;aw the whole operation.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e in&s;tances are every day happening in which it is our duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t our fellow creatures in circum&s;tances of pain and di&s;tre&s;s; and, if we were to indulge a reluctance to come near to them on tho&s;e occa|&s;ions, we &s;hould never acquire either the knowledge or the pre&s;ence of mind nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I had been told how to help people in &s;uch ca&s;es, could not I do it without being u&s;ed to &s;ee them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; we have all naturally a horror at every thing which is the cau&s;e of pain and danger to our&s;elves and others; and nothing but habit can give mo&s;t of us the pre&s;ence of mind nece&s;&s;ary to enable us, in &s;uch oc|currences, to employ our knowledge to the be&s;t advan|tage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is <HI>pre&s;ence of mind,</HI> mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the &s;teady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our&s;elves in ca&s;es of alarm, that prevents us from being flurried and fright|ened. You have heard the expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>having all our wits about us.</HI> This is the effect of pre&s;ence of mind, and
<PB N="232" REF="035911_0117_1007BFEFF4CCFBA8">
a mo&s;t ine&s;timable quality it is; for without it, we are full as likely to run into danger as to avoid it. Do you not remember of hearing of your cou&s;in Mary's cap taking fire in the candle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, the maid, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw it, &s;et up a great &s;cream, and ran out of the room; and Mary might have been burnt to death for any a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he could give her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>How fooli&s;h that was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. The girl had not the lea&s;t pre&s;ence of mind, and the con&s;equence was, depriving her of all recollection, and making her entirely u&s;ele&s;s. But as &s;oon as your aunt came up, &s;he took the right method for preventing the mi&s;chief. The cap was too much on fire to be pulled off, &s;o &s;he whipped a quilt from the bed, and flung it round Mary's head, and thus &s;tifled the flame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mary was a good deal &s;corched, though.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but it was very well that it was no wor&s;e. If the maid, however, had acted with any &s;en&s;e at fir&s;t, no harm at all would have been done, except burning the cap. I remember a much more fatal example of the want of pre&s;ence of mind. The mi&s;tre&s;s of a family was awakened by flames bur&s;ting through the wain&s;cot into her chamber. She flew to the &s;tair-ca&s;e; and, in her confu&s;ion, in&s;tead of going up &s;tairs to call her children, who &s;lept together in the nur&s;ery over-head, and who might all have e&s;caped by the top of the hou&s;e, &s;he ran down, and, with much danger, made way through the fire into the &s;treet. When &s;he had got thither, the thought of her poor children ru&s;hed into her mind, but it was too late; the &s;tairs had caught fire, &s;o that nobody could get near them, and they were burned in their beds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a &s;ad thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sad, indeed! Now I will tell you of a dif|ferent conduct. A lady was awakened by the crackling of fire, and &s;aw it &s;hining under her chamber floor. Her hu&s;band would immediately have opened the door, but &s;he prevented him, &s;ince the &s;moke and flame would then have bur&s;t in upon them. The children, with a maid,
<PB N="233" REF="035911_0117_1007BFEFF4CCFBA8">
&s;lept in a room opening out of theirs. She went and awakened them; and, tying together the &s;heets and blankets, &s;he &s;ent down the maid from the window fir&s;t, and then let down the children, one by one, to her; la&s;t of all &s;he de&s;cended her&s;elf. A few minutes after the floor fell in, and all the hou&s;e was in flames.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a happy e&s;cape!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and with what cool recollection of mind was it managed! For mothers to love their chil|dren, and be willing to run any hazards for them, is common; but in weak minds that very love is apt to prevent exertions in time of danger. I have heard a remarkable &s;tory of the mother of that Mr. Day who wrote <HI>Sanford and Merton.</HI> She was di&s;tingui&s;hed, as he &s;o was, for courage and pre&s;ence of mind. When a young woman, &s;he was one day walking in the fields with a companion, when they perceived a bull coming to them, roaring and to&s;&s;ing about his horns in the mo&s;t tremendous manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, how I &s;hould have &s;creamed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare &s;ay you would; and &s;o did her com|panion. But &s;he bid her walk away behind her as gently as &s;he could, whil&s;t &s;he her&s;elf &s;topt &s;hort, and faced the bull, eyeing him with a determined countenance. The bull, when he had come near, &s;topt al&s;o, pawing the ground and roaring. Few animals will attack a man who &s;teadily waits for them. In a while, &s;he drew back &s;ome &s;teps, &s;till facing the bull. The bull followed. She &s;topt, and then he &s;topt. In this manner, &s;he made good her retreat to the &s;tile over which her companion had before got. She then turned and &s;prung over it, and got clear out of danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was bravely done indeed! but I think very few women could have done as much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such a degree of cool re&s;olution, to be &s;ure, is not very common. But I have read of a lady in the Ea&s;t-Indies who &s;hewed, at lea&s;t, as much. She was &s;itting out of doors with a party of plea&s;ure, when they were aware of a huge tyger that had crept through a hedge near them, and was ju&s;t ready to make his fatal &s;pring. They were &s;truck with the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation;
<PB N="234" REF="035911_0118_1007BFF2BB331B08">
but &s;he, with an umbrella in her hand, turned to the tyger, and &s;uddenly &s;pread it full in his face. This unu&s;ual a&s;&s;ault &s;o terrified the bea&s;t, that taking a pro|digious leap, he &s;prung over the fence, and plunged out of &s;ight into the neighbouring thicket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that was the bolde&s;t thing I ever heard of. But is it po&s;&s;ible, mamma, to make one's &s;elf coura|geous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Courage, my dear, is of two kinds; one the gift of nature, the other of rea&s;on and habit. Men have naturally more courage than women; that is, they are le&s;s affected by danger; it make a le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion upon them, and does not flutter their &s;pirits &s;o much. This is owing to the difference of their bodily con&s;titution; and, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, &s;ome men and &s;ome women are more courageous than others. But the other kind of courage, may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be acquired by every one. Rea&s;on teaches us to face &s;maller dangers, in order to avoid greater, and even to undergo the greate&s;t, when our duty requires it. The courage of women is chief|ly tried in dome&s;tic dangers. They are attendants on the &s;ick and dying; and they mu&s;t qualify them&s;elves to go through many &s;cenes of terror, in the&s;e &s;ituations, which would alarm the &s;toute&s;t hearted man, who was not accu&s;tomed to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard that women generally bear pain and illne&s;s better than men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>They do &s;o, becau&s;e they are more u&s;ed to them, both in them&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I &s;hould not be afraid again to &s;ee any body blooded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not. It was for that purpo&s;e I made you &s;tand by me. And I would have you always force your&s;elf to look on and give a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;es of this kind, however painful it may at fir&s;t be to you, that you may, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, gain that pre&s;ence of mind which ari&s;es from habit.</P>

<P>Do you give the name of ceremony to your duty? this &s;hews you as heedle&s;s as u&s;ual: but the young lady's behaviour has not that re&s;erve or di&s;cretion that I could wi&s;h in the per&s;on whom you de&s;ire to make your friend. I think &s;he &s;hould have waited for my invitation.</P>

Yes, my dear, we are now reunited forever. I perceived your &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing me treat Mi&s;s Bland with &s;o much freedom and &s;eeming incivility; but you know that all my happine&s;s is cen|tered in you; judge then of my feelings, when I &s;aw it &s;o near being embittered by her &s;educing arts. You have as yet no idea of the unhappy condition of a woman, who is early &s;poiled by flattery. Coming into the world with preten&s;ions that nothing can ju&s;tify, and an opinion of her own merit, in which nobody el&s;e joins her, what mortifications mu&s;t &s;he experience! As to the homage &s;he expected, the more her pride exacts it, the more &s;he finds it withheld, and the &s;neer of contempt &s;upply its place. If, blinded as &s;he is by &s;elf-opinion, a tran&s;ient ray of reflection &s;hould enlighten her for a moment, and &s;hew her the true &s;tate of her&s;elf, what &s;hame mu&s;t &s;he feel on finding her&s;elf de&s;titute of a claim to tho&s;e qual|ities, which &s;he imagined her&s;elf to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and what re|gret at having lo&s;t the opportunities of acquiring them! On what &s;hould &s;he, for the future, found her preten&s;ions to public e&s;teem, to the love of her hu&s;band, or the re|&s;pect of her family? To &s;tifle the reproaches of her mind as well as the trouble&s;ome con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own want of merit, &s;he can &s;uffer none about her, but de&s;picable flatterers of the &s;ame &s;tamp with tho&s;e, who fir&s;t corrupt|ed her under&s;tanding; and to crown her di&s;grace, while &s;he contemns them, &s;he feels her&s;elf worthy of their con|tempt. Irritated by all the&s;e mortifications, &s;he is &s;till farther tortured at the &s;ight of de&s;ert in another, even in her own children. If &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hes any by her regard, it is tho&s;e whom &s;he has tutored to a &s;ervile compliance with her folly; and thus &s;he is condemned to the crime of corrupting their veracity, in order to make them wor|thy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ects of her affection.</P>

<P>Well then, in order to re&s;t your imagination upon more agreeable objects, picture to your&s;elf a young woman adorned with that mode&s;ty, which is &s;o graceful, and with that diffidence in her powers of plea&s;ing, which gives them their highe&s;t charm. Even the flatterers re|&s;pect her, even the envious receive her with a &s;mile. By mode&s;tly yielding to her rivals all that they a&s;&s;ume, &s;he takes the &s;ure&s;t way to gain a &s;uperiority over them. She &s;eems to appear every day with a con&s;tant addition of good qualities, as the e&s;teem which &s;he in&s;pires puts peo|ple upon finding new graces in her character. A&s;&s;i&s;ted by the advice of her friends, which her diffidence induces her to accept, &s;he is beloved by them as the creature of their good wi&s;hes. The homage addre&s;&s;ed to her, from all quarters, enhances her value in the eyes of her hu&s;|band, who therefore &s;tudies to become more worthy of her affection by his con&s;tancy and attention. Her chil|dren nouri&s;hed by her virtues, look up to no other pattern; and indeed the experience of her own &s;ucce&s;s will make her the more proper to direct their education. She will be able to qualify them for the happine&s;s which &s;he her&s;elf enjoys.

But as to a beggar, it's quite another thing; he comes and a&s;ks me for money; but what has be to &s;how for it? what does he bring me in exchange? why a long &s;tory that he i'n't worth a penny! what's that to me? nothing at all.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION. A SHORT SYSTEM OF VIRTUE AND HAP|PINESS.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL &s;uppo&s;e a virtuous young lady form|ing in her mind the principles of her future conduct, and uttering the re&s;ult of her reflections in the following &s;olil|oquy.</P>
<P>"At the time when I am approaching to maturity of rea&s;on, I perceive my&s;elf placed in a world abounding with external objects, and I al&s;o perceive within me fac|ulties and pa&s;&s;ions formed to be powerfully excited by them. I am naturally tempted to interrogate my&s;elf, What am I? Whence came I? and, Whither am I going?</P>
<P>"With a view to &s;atisfy my own inquiries, I con&s;ider others who appear to be ju&s;t like my&s;elf; I li&s;ten to the in&s;truction of tho&s;e who are older and wi&s;er than I am; and I examine, with &s;erious attention, the volumes of di|vine in&s;piration.</P>
<P>"The re&s;ult of the whole inquiry is a &s;incere convic|tion, that I am placed here to perform many duties; that I originate from a &s;upreme Creator; and that I am going on in the journey of life, to accompli&s;h &s;ome of his gracious purpo&s;es at the clo&s;e of it, as well as in its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>"I divide my duty into three parts, according to the &s;ugge&s;tions of my own rea&s;on, and the in&s;truction of books. They con&s;i&s;t of the obligations which I owe to my&s;elf, to others, and to him, in who&s;e hands are both they and I, the great Lord of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>"With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, as I con&s;i&s;t of two parts, a body and a mind, my duty to my&s;elf divides it&s;elf into two parts al&s;o. My body is a machine curiou&s;ly organ|ized, and ea&s;ily deranged by exce&s;s and irregularity. When di&s;turbed in its economy, it &s;ubjects me to pain,
<PB N="320" REF="035911_0161_1007C0600796BFC0">
and di&s;ables me from all nece&s;&s;ary and plea&s;ant exertion. I owe it therefore to my&s;elf to live a regular, orderly, and indu&s;trious life; neither to turn night into day, by keeping late hours, nor to enter into gaming, which keeps the pa&s;&s;ions con&s;tantly irritated; not to indulge in eating or drinking to exce&s;s, nor to give my&s;elf up to &s;loth and indolence, which would unnerve every faculty of the mind, and prevent my making a progre&s;s in any virtuous or laudable pur&s;uits. I further learn from the religion of my country, that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit: con&s;equently it is my duty to live according to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of cha&s;tity and virtue; a violation of which is not only injuring my&s;elf, but al&s;o &s;inning again&s;t my great Creator.</P>
<P>"But I have a mind al&s;o capable of great improvement by culture, or of becoming vain, fooli&s;h, and &s;tupid, by neglect. I will not lo&s;e any of the advantages of my education. I will not wa&s;te my time in reading novels, which &s;erve either to corrupt the mind, or to convey fal&s;e ideas of life and manners. But I will devote my lei&s;ure hours to reading books of real in&s;truction, and to reflection; for whatever tends to improve the mind, tends al&s;o to &s;weeten the temper and refine the manners.</P>
<P>"My mind as well as my body is concerned in avoid|ing every kind of intemperance. Sen&s;ual indulgencies deba&s;e and corrupt the mind. Their delights are tran|&s;ient, their pains &s;evere, and of long duration.</P>
<P>"Inexperienced youth is &s;urrounded with temptations. I will fly from the conflict in which my own pa&s;&s;ions would fight again&s;t me, and perhaps betray me to the enemy. I will pray to be delivered from temptation; for alas! I am too much inclined to vice, from the im|perfection of my nature, and the violence of my pa&s;&s;ions. But I will not be a reclu&s;e. The world abounds in in|nocent enjoyments, and the kind God of nature intended I &s;hould ta&s;te them; but moderation is e&s;&s;ential to true plea&s;ure. My own experience, and the experience of mankind from their origin, has declared, that whenever plea&s;ure exceeds the bounds of moderation, it is not only highly injurious, but di&s;gu&s;tful. In order to enjoy plea&s;ure, I &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of devoting part of my time
<PB N="321" REF="035911_0161_1007C0600796BFC0">
to u&s;eful employments, becoming my &s;ex and &s;ituation. The vici&s;&s;itude is nece&s;&s;ary to excite an appetite and give a reli&s;h. Nay, the very performance of nece&s;&s;ary duties, is attended with a delightful &s;atisfaction, which few of the mo&s;t boa&s;ted amu&s;ements are able to confer.</P>
<P>"While I take care of my&s;elf, of my health, of my improvement in morals and under&s;tanding, I will not harbour pride, or look down with &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s or ill-nature on tho&s;e who live, as it were, at random, and who acknowledge no other guide of their conduct but the &s;udden impul&s;e of a temporary inclination. With all my improvements and endeavours, I &s;hall &s;till feel imperfections enough to humble me. Candour and humility are &s;ome of the lea&s;t fallible marks of &s;ound &s;en&s;e and &s;incere virtue. I &s;hall have &s;ufficient employ|ment in correcting my&s;elf; nor &s;hall I pre&s;ume to cen|&s;ure others, unle&s;s my duty renders it nece&s;&s;ary. My duty to my&s;elf is, indeed, intimately connected with my duty to others. By pre&s;erving the faculties of the mind and body, and by improving them to the utmo&s;t, I am enabled to exert them with effect in the &s;ervice of tho&s;e around me.</P>
<P>"I am connected with others by the ties of con&s;anguin|ity and friend&s;hip, and by the common bond of partak|ing in the &s;ame humanity. As a daughter, I &s;hall be tender and dutiful; as a &s;i&s;ter, uniformly affectionate; as a wife, faithful and friendly; as a mother, kind and attentive; as one of the human kind, benevolent to all per&s;ons in whatever circum&s;tances, and however &s;epa|rated from me by country or religion.</P>
<P>"But univer&s;al benevolence mu&s;t not be an inactive principle. If it proceed not to real beneficence, I fear it will have more in it of o&s;tentation than of &s;incerity. I will then prove its &s;incerity by doing good, and remov|ing evil of every kind, as far as my abilities allow me, and my influence extends.</P>
<P>"But before I pretend to genero&s;ity, I will be &s;trictly ju&s;t. Truth &s;hall regulate my words, and equity my actions. In all my intercour&s;e with &s;ociety, I will rec|ollect that heavenly precept, of doing to others as I wi&s;h they &s;hould do to me, and will endeavour to obey it.
<PB N="322" REF="035911_0162_1007C0619EDCCD78">
I may, I certainly &s;hall offend from the violence of my pa&s;&s;ions, the weakne&s;s of my judgment, the perver&s;ene&s;s of my will, and from mi&s;take and mi&s;apprehen&s;ion. But while I keep the evangelical rule in view, and &s;in|cerely labour to conform to it, I &s;hall &s;eldom commit &s;uch offences again&s;t others, as will be either perma|nently or deeply injurious.</P>
<P>"With re&s;pect to my duty to my Creator, I derive an argument in favour of religion, from the feelings of my own bo&s;om, &s;uperior to the mo&s;t elaborate &s;ubtilties of human ingenuity. In the hour of di&s;tre&s;s, my heart as naturally flies for &s;uccour to the Deity, as when hungry and thir&s;ty I &s;eek food and water; or when weary, repo&s;e. In religion I look for comfort, and in religion I always find it. Devotion &s;upplies me with a pure and exalted plea&s;ure. It elevates my &s;oul, and teaches me to look down with a proper contempt upon many objects which are eagerly &s;ought, but which end in mi&s;ery. In this re&s;pect, and in many others, it effects, in the be&s;t and mo&s;t compendious method, what has been in vain pretended to by proud philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>"And in &s;electing a mode or peculiar &s;y&s;tem of relig|ion, I &s;hall con&s;ider what that was in which my ance&s;tors lived and died. I find it to have been the religion of Chri&s;t. I examine it with reverence. I feel within me an internal evidence, which, uniting its force with the exter|nal, forbids me to di&s;believe. When involuntary doubts ari&s;e, I immediately &s;ilence their importunity by recol|lecting the weakne&s;s of my judgment, and the vain pre|&s;umption of ha&s;tily deciding on the mo&s;t important of all &s;ubjects, again&s;t &s;uch powerful evidence, and again&s;t the major part of the civilized world.</P>
<P>"I will learn humility of the humble Je&s;us, and grate|fully accept the beneficial doctrines, and glorious offers which his benign religion reaches out to all who &s;incerely &s;eek him by prayer and penitence.</P>
<P>"Human life abounds with evil. I will &s;eek bal&s;ams for the wounds of the heart, in the &s;weets of innocence and in the con&s;olations of religion. Virtue, I am con|vinced, is the noble&s;t ornament of humanity, and the &s;ource of the &s;ublime&s;t and the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ure; and
<PB N="323" REF="035911_0162_1007C0619EDCCD78">
piety leads to that peace, which the world, and all it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es cannot be&s;tow. When the gaudy glories of fa&s;hion and of vain philo&s;ophy &s;hall have withered like a &s;hort-lived flower, &s;incere piety and true virtue &s;hall flouri&s;h like the cedar of Lebanon. But I repre&s;s my triumphs. After all my improvements, and all my de&s;ires of per|fection, I &s;hall &s;till be greatly defective. Therefore, to whatever degree of excellence I advance, let me never forget to &s;hew to others that indulgence which my in|firmities, my errors, and my voluntary mi&s;conduct will require both from them, and from mine and their al|mighty and mo&s;t merciful Father."</P>
