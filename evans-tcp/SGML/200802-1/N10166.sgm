<P>WHEREAS I am now under &s;entence of death in the City-Hall of Albany, for having as it is &s;up|po&s;ed, counterfeited the currency of this province; and having &s;crutinized my con&s;cience, which beareth witne&s;s to the truth of what I &s;hall now deliver, of my own free will, which I hope will be publi&s;hed according to my de|&s;ire.</P>
<P>If I were to write the whole of my tran&s;actions they would fill a large volume; but in this my journal, I only mean to give a conci&s;e and tree narrative of my proceed|ings.</P>
<P>I was born in Connecticut, at a place called Groton, near New-London, in the Year 1720. My parents were reputable people, who, both by example and precept endeavoured to inculcate principles of virtue and honor in me. From my youth I have been an admirer of the operations of nature, and never de&s;i&s;ted from enquiring

info any thing that I thought an arcanum until I had ob|tained &s;ome idea of it, my thir&s;t after knowledge being in&s;atiable.</P>
<P>When I arrived at the twenty &s;econd year of my age, my inclination prompted me to vi&s;it the &s;outhern colo|nies, I traveled into Virginia, where I re&s;ided near &s;ixteen years&punc; The principal part of my bu&s;ine&s;s was curing cancers; of this art I may ju&s;tly call my&s;elf ma&s;ter, as I have cured every &s;pecies of them except the &s;anguine cancer, and even that &s;ome times when the blood was not too much infected. I under&s;tand the &s;eperation of metals, and was often called upon to examine minerals. In Virginia, Colonel Che&s;well, who had lead mines, em|ployed me to work upon lead and copper ore: He died, and Colonel James Bird, who became &s;ole owner of the mines, declined having them worked. From the&s;e works, which are &s;ituate at a place called New-River, near the line which divides North Carolina from Virginia, I went to Dan River, which I cro&s;&s;ed and came to a place called Sali&s;bury, in Roan county, North Carolina. After &s;pend|ing a few days there I &s;teered my cour&s;e to Meclinburgh, which lies upon the Calava River. This &s;eemed to be a good place for my bu&s;ine&s;s; and, as the county was young and the court hou&s;e then building. I re&s;olved to make that the place of my re&s;idence.</P>
<P>HAVING agreed for my board and lodging, and being informed that &s;everal per&s;ons in the nieghbourhood were afflicted with cancers, I publi&s;hed an adverti&s;ement, the purport of which was, that I would undertake to cure them, and if I did not &s;ucceed, no money &s;hould be de|manded. This had the de&s;ired effect, for in a few days I had &s;everal patients.</P>

her no&s;e; the next was one James Mac, he had been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a cancer for upwards of twenty two years, and was, indeed, a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle to look upon; three months elap&s;ed before I could cure him. I can|not forbear relating an incident that happened to this man while he was my patient: After I cau&s;ed the can|cer to fall out, and he place nearly healed, a cow broke into his corn-field which put him in a violent pa&s;&s;ion; he loaded a pi&s;tol almo&s;t full with powder and &s;alt, went into the field to frighten the cow, and &s;napped the pi&s;tol &s;everal times, but it mi&s;&s;ing fire, he held it carele&s;sly in his hand; however, &s;ome &s;parks having remained in the pan, it went off at a time when he did not expect it; the cock flew up, cut his under lip two thirds off, &s;truck through his no&s;e, and broke up the cancer: I was oblig|ed to &s;ew his lip and heal that wound, which required nearly as much time as the cancer had done. This hap|pened in Tryon County, near Broad River, that falls in|to Santee on the &s;outh border of North Carolina.</P>
<P>IN that country I became acquainted with &s;everal gen|tlemen, who de&s;ired me to make their hou&s;es my home, when I came near them; they declared it &s;hould not co&s;t me any money if I would tarry with them all that winter.&mdash;I accepted their kind invitation; and, as I under&s;tand watch work, I con&s;tantly employed my&s;elf at that bu&s;i|ne&s;s, unle&s;s when called abroad.</P>
<P>IN that &s;ituation I remained &s;everal years, but having a &s;trong de&s;ire to vi&s;it my brethren in New-England, I made application to my patients, and got in part of the money they owed to me; tho&s;e who could not pay I did not di&s;tre&s;s, nor would I accept of any reward from tho&s;e per&s;ons who required my help and were in low cir|cum&s;tances, being always apprehen&s;ive that if I accepted a fee it might di&s;enable them to provide nece&s;&s;aries for their children; nor did I turn away poor people who appli|ed to me for help but con&s;tantly exerted my abilities for their relief.</P>

WHILE I remained in North Carolina, at the hou&s;e of a gentleman who was a Ju&s;tice of the peace, there came a poor woman driving a cow before her; my landlord enquiring where &s;he was driving the cow, &s;he an&s;wered, to the doctor, that it was the la&s;t &s;he had, and that her children mu&s;t now be deprived of milk. I a&s;ked what was her di&s;order; &s;he replied a cancer in her no&s;e; I de&s;ired to &s;ee it, and to know how long &s;he had been in the doc|tor's hands; &s;he &s;aid (to the be&s;t of my remembrance) a year or a year and a half. My landlord informed me that &s;he was a poor widow who lived about four miles di&s;tant from his hou&s;e; that her name was Clark, and that &s;he had a great many poor naked children. My heart then felt a melting charity for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widow:&mdash;I told her, that with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, I would cure her, and de&s;ired her call upon me when &s;he returned from the doctor. She complied, and I applied my medicine, and told her, that by the time &s;he got home the cancer would drop out, which accordingly happened, and in le&s;s than three weeks &s;he was perfectly cured. The poor creature was willing to give me all &s;he had in the world, but I would accept of nothing; for God gave me the cure, not to oppre&s;s widows, or make fatherle&s;s children cry for bread, but to releive the afflicted; and this duty corre&s;ponds with my natural di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>IN the month of September, 1770, I began my jour|ney into from North-Carolina, to New-England. No remarkable event happened in my travels until I came to Wyoming, on Su&s;quehanna, where I found &s;everal of my relations, but we did not know each other till I told them my name; then they remembered that they had heard their fathers &s;peak of me. Upon the road to Wyoming, I had obtained intelligence that a company of Penn&s;yl|vanians were coming to drive off the &s;ettlers there; and, as I always was a lover of my countrymen, I warned them of the approaching danger.</P>
<P>AT Wyoming I continued with my relations four days,
<PB N="7" REF="012915_0005_0F8E6E0285A177A0">
and then proceeded on my journey to Delaware River; there I was informed that Captain Ogden and his com|pany had marched to Ea&s;t-Town, after having lain in wait for &s;ome time to intercept &s;uch New-England peo|ple as might pa&s;s between Su&s;quehanna and New-Eng|land. There was a man and a woman with me, the man's name was John Wicki&s;ine, we were well armed and re&s;olved not to be impo&s;ed upon whatever might be the event. We went on unmole&s;ted, came to Fi&s;h Kill Ferry, and cro&s;&s;ed Hud&s;on-River, we travelled on the po&s;t road until we arrived at De Bois's Tavern, there we continued two days, as my companion Wicki&s;ine wanted to hire a hou&s;e for him&s;elf and family, but the landlord and him could not agree upon the terms. At this Tavern I met with one Doctor Smith, he informed me that he lived near Groton River, and that he had been at New-York upon affairs of importance: He was a man of affability and a good orator; we entered into an argument, and I found him to be a man of &s;en&s;e and learned in the &s;ciences. I was &s;o charmed with his di&s;|cour&s;es upon philo&s;ophy, that I could have &s;pent the re|mainder of my days with him: He de&s;ired me to ride along with him, I complied, and the &s;ubject of our con|ver&s;ation was nature, the productions of nature, and the primary cau&s;es of &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing effects. The Doctor conducted me to his own hou&s;e, which was a tavern, and there I lodged that night: During the evening we talk|ed about various matters, but not a word was mentioned about counterfeiting money. Among other things our conver&s;ation turned upon the tran&s;mutation of metals; the Doctor told me that he was ma&s;ter of that art, but that his exten&s;ive practice of phy&s;ick would not permit him to pro&s;ecute his di&s;coveries in alchymy. I inform|ed him that I intended to begin a cour&s;e of experiments if I could get a convenient place to carry it on the pro|ce&s;s: He recommended me to Capt. Hard of New-Mill|ford, who, he &s;aid, had for &s;everal years been carrying on operations of that nature.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012915_0006_0F8E6E0317D793A0">
HAVING taken leave of Doctor Smith, I proceeded to New-Millford, enquired for Capt. Hard, and was very courteou&s;ly received by him; I found him to be a gen|tleman of &s;trict honor and integrity, and I had a very cor|dial e&s;teem for him.</P>
<P>I had not remained long there until I received a vi&s;it from Doctor Smith; he reque&s;ted that I would cut his coat of arms, which he told me he wanted to put into his books and gave me a precedent that was done in England. I cut the plate and &s;ent it to him by one David Thar, whom he &s;ent to receive it; &s;oon after the Doctor favour|ed me with another vi&s;it, and after a long prefatory di&s;|cour&s;e, informed me that he wanted more work done, and that if I would take it in hand to execute it I &s;hould be hand&s;omely rewarded. I enquired what he wanted en|graved, he &s;aid he would &s;how me a pattern, and &s;oon after brought me a ten &s;hilling bill and a&s;ked if I could imitate it; I an&s;wered him in the affirmative, but told him I did not choo&s;e to do &s;uch work, being then engaged in philo&s;ophic &s;tudies: I repre&s;ented to him the enormity of the crime, and endeavoured to di&s;uade him from per|&s;i&s;ting in it: his reply was, that the great men are guilty of greater frauds, and that for his part he did not mean to enrich him&s;elf by emitting a large number of bills, his principal motive being curio&s;ity to know how near he could imitate the true bill. I told him it was impo&s;&s;ible to do it &s;o exact as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hable from the genuine bill: He &s;aid that a little difference was not material, with &s;undry other words to that effect. Capt. Hard, under&s;tanding his errand, gave him a &s;harp re|primand, and told me that if I worked for the Doctor I &s;hould not &s;tay one hour longer in his hou&s;e: I promi&s;|ed that I would not, but one word brought on another, we differed, and I left him.&mdash;Oh! unhappy day!&mdash;for having no over&s;eer to watch for my good I met again with Mr. Smith; who, taking advantage of my week capacity, debauched my judgment with &s;ophi&s;tical rea|&s;oning and made me err.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="012915_0007_0F8E6E05C3627868">
ANXIOUS to improve my&s;elf by philo&s;ophic &s;tudies, naturally inclined to learning, remarkably inqui&s;itive a|bout the &s;ecrets of nature and &s;cience, I travelled to Sa|ratoga, with an intention to &s;et up my works; and ac|cordingly built a &s;hop for that purpo&s;e at the hou&s;e of John Davis. I agreed with Capt. Garri&s;on to bring me &s;tills, gla&s;&s;es, and other materials from New-York. When the&s;e things arrived I prepaired to begin my operations, but a mi&s;under&s;tanding happening between the woman of the hou&s;e and me, I re&s;olved to leave that place.</P>
<P>I went down to New-Britain, but it being the winter &s;ea&s;on and the cold very inten&s;e, I could not erect my works, but embraced that opportunity to tran&s;cribe my philo&s;ophy book, which I did at the hou&s;e of Samuel Wheeler.</P>
<P>As I under&s;tood that Doctor Whiting kept potters works, and having occa&s;ion for &s;ome earthen &s;tills, I went to his hou&s;e and gave him directions about them; it re|quired &s;ome time before they could be fini&s;hed, and in the interim I employed my&s;elf in preparing medicines at Samuel Wheeler's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I went again to Doctor Whiting's, expecting my &s;tills were done, but found they were not. This circum&s;tance retarded my bu&s;ine&s;s, and becau&s;e I applied clo&s;ely to my &s;tudies and &s;pent the greate&s;t part of my time in my &s;hop, a report was circulated about the country that I was counterfeiting bills and coining money. I declare, before God! that the &s;aid report, was <HI>fal&s;e!</HI> for I did not make nor offer to pa&s;s any bad money, nor never had any thoughts on that &s;ubject. Con&s;cious of my in|nocence, I gave my&s;elf no trouble about their &s;urmi&s;es, until I heard that they had applied for and obtained a warrant, either at Kinderhook or Clavarack, again&s;t me. This made me very unea&s;y and confirmed my determi|nation of abandoning a place where the people were &s;o cen&s;orious and malicious.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012915_0008_0F8E6E069418DDF0">
I then re&s;olved upon a reclu&s;e way of life, and erected a hou&s;e in a &s;olitary place, where intended to carry on my chymical proce&s;s; but having made an excur&s;ion from my habitation, I met with one Hulburt, who informed me that he had been long &s;earching for me, and that he was employed by Daniel Lewis of Sheffield.</P>
<P>WHEN he acquainted me with his bu&s;ine&s;s, I told him that nothing could induce me to be concerned in his Scheme; that being now an old man, and my eye-&s;ight much decayed, I had given over engraving nice work; and that being then engaged in other bu&s;ine&s;s, I had neither time nor inclination to comply with his requi|&s;ition; but he per&s;i&s;ted to per&s;uade and make me large offers.</P>
<P>I am now tried, convicted and condemned, on &s;u&s;pici|on of having counterfeited the currency of this province; but, if the word of a dying man can be taken, I am in|nocent of the crime imputed to me. I never did make, &s;ign or pa&s;s counterfeit Bills; nor had I any hand in the &s;cheme further than what I have related. In my manner of living I always &s;tudied not to give offence even to Children; and as I practiced no deceit, it never occured to me that others would u&s;e it. In the days of pro&s;perity Gold and Silver was not too precious for me; but no &s;ooner did adver&s;ity appear, than tho&s;e whom I former|ly imagined to be my be&s;t friends, having obtained their ends and glutted their mi&s;chevious appetites; they compa&s;&s;ed me about like a troubled &s;ea, and having the poi&s;on of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> under their tongues they have done their utmo&s;t to de&s;troy their fellow creatures in hopes to clear their own characters. Alas! the &s;tronge&s;t ca&s;tle may be taken when be&s;ieged by &s;uperior force; and if a man is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by large offers and in&s;inuation, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing if he &s;urrender, e&s;pecially if his poverty and good nature are taken the advantge of.

<PB N="11" REF="012915_0009_0F8E6E0757C2FA30">
their pardon, but it plainly appearth that I never coined, di&s;per&s;ed, nor pa&s;&s;ed one penny of bad money; but it &s;eems that I mu&s;t be an <HI>E&s;cape Goat</HI> to bear their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions into the other world.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN the cour&s;e of my peregrinations through Virginia, I came to a certain gentleman's hou&s;e which I made my home for upwards of four years. During that time I became acquainted with one of his daughters, and at la&s;t we bought proper, and indeed it was high time, to marry; ac|cordingly we entered into the connubial &s;tate. About half a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> after, my wife and me held a con&s;ultation upon the po&s;ture four affairs; and, after a good deal of confabulation, we included that living with her parents did not &s;uit our conveni|ent. I propo&s;ed to go and &s;eek a place that would be more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">able to us, and ob&s;erved to my wife, that as I had two <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hor&s;es, &s;he might, if &s;he plea&s;ed, take a ride along with
<PB N="13" REF="012915_0011_0F8E6E085CD005B8">
&s;he acquie&s;ed, and, having made &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary preparations for our journey, we &s;et off together.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We rode about eighty miles up into the country, and came to a quaker &s;ettlement called Opechen Creek, where we put up at a</HI> friend's <HI>hou&s;e; the gentleman was extremely civil, and we di&s;cour&s;ed very joco&s;ely together. He a&s;ked where we were journeying:&mdash;we an&s;wered, to &s;eek our fortune, and enquired if they wanted to hire a School ma&s;ter at that &s;ettlement? He &s;aid they did, and &s;hould be very fond of a good one. His reply plea&s;ed me exceeding well, and we determined to abide with them; the</HI> freinds <HI>being a very good people to live with, e&s;pecially if they find that tho&s;e whom they employ are hone&s;t and have merit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I engaged with them a year. They built a hou&s;e for me and my wife, and a &s;chool hou&s;e adjacent. When the build|ings were fini&s;hed, the</HI> brothers <HI>and</HI> &s;i&s;ters, <HI>as they call them, pre&s;ented us with every uten&s;il nece&s;&s;ary for hou&s;e keeping. We then made as re&s;pectable an appearance as any of our neighbours&punc; I opened my &s;chool, went on extraordinary well, and had the univer&s;al applau&s;e of my con&s;tituents.</HI></P>
<P>GENERAL BRADDOCK'S <HI>defeat happening about four months after our &s;ettlement at Opechen, threw a damp upon our hap|pine&s;s; I was in my &s;chool hou&s;e when the &s;ad news arrived; the whole &s;ettlement was alarmed, being apprehen&s;ive that the victors would follow their blow and ravage the country with fire and &s;word. I &s;till continued my &s;chool, but, in about two months after, the murder &s;hout was heard in our neighbour|hood; numbers of people were killed and &s;calped, and the mi&s;er|able fugitives who e&s;caped with life were at a lo&s;s where to fly for protection! At la&s;t I was obliged to abandon my happy &s;ettlement, and, with my wife, repair to a fort; there not re|mained near two months, but the place being much <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, by the multitude who came there for protection and we having our two hor&s;es with us, made it very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;tay there. My wife and me came to a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to leave the

fort, and not choo&s;ing to &s;ettle again in a country &s;o open to the incur&s;ions of a mercile&s;s enemy, we prepared for a journey into the province of Penn&s;ylvania; we arrived &s;afe there, rented a room, and I re&s;umed my practice of &s;urgery and curing can|cers. I had &s;urpri&s;ing good &s;ucce&s;s, and obtained the name of an experienced practitioner in phy&s;ic, but the tide of fortune a|gain turned and &s;et hard again&s;t me; I catched the infection of the &s;mall-pox; the eruption was copious and the &s;ymtoms very unfavourable. I entreated my wife to leave my room and keep at a di&s;tance from me, but her tenderne&s;s for me would not permit her to comply with my reque&s;t. I was under vio|lent apprehen&s;ions, that if &s;he got infected, in the condition &s;he was then in, that the con&s;equence would be fatal. Alas! my imaginary di&s;tre&s;s was very &s;oon realized; &s;he &s;ickened, the pu&s;tles appeared, and on the &s;ixteenth day of her illne&s;s, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible grief, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I had a boy three years of age, who was dangerou&s;ly ill of the &s;ame di&s;temper that had been fatal to his mother; at the &s;ame time, I was not &s;ufficiently recovered to quit my bed; my &s;ituation was truly pitiable, I was &s;ick, dejected, and forlorn, among &s;trangers; my expence for attendance, nur&s;ing, and in|deed I may &s;ay for every thing, amounted to a con&s;iderable &s;um, and I was then in a place where &s;omething could not be had for nothing.</HI></P>
<P>UPON <HI>my recovery I propo&s;ed to vi&s;it my old friends the Quakers, but hearing that times were altered, much for the wor&s;e, in their &s;ettlement, I declined it. Having agreed with an old welch widow for my boy's board and lodging, I continued my practice of &s;urgery and had tolerable &s;ucce&s;s. As &s;oon as my boy was able to go, I &s;ent him to &s;chool, and he became a very good &s;cholar&mdash;I fervently implore the A mighty to pre|&s;erve, govern and ble&s;s him.</HI></P>
