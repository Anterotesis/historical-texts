<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE NATURE OF WAR, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THE two general views in which the &s;ubject of this day's thank&s;giving can only be con&s;idered, are</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As an event that, in its cau&s;e and con&s;equences, is connected only with the pre&s;ent life; and being vi&s;ibly produced by the efforts of human wi&s;dom and human &s;trength, is the ground of human exultation and triumph. And,</P>
<P>Secondly, As the &s;ole and immediate work of "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH"&mdash; a part of the admini&s;tration of that Merciful Provi|dence, which, through all the revolutions of di&s;ordered nature and di&s;ordered life, pur&s;ues but one invariable purpo&s;e, the Redemption and Salvation of man.</P>
<P>It would be needle&s;s to propo&s;e the &s;ubject, in the fir&s;t view, to the con&s;ideration of true Chri&s;tians; who know, with the &s;ame certainty as they know their own exi&s;tence, that human nature, left to it&s;elf, has no power but that of producing mere evil; and that every thing with|in

it and without it that is either great or good, is the free gift of Grace, the unmerited bounty of Redeeming Love. But the true Chri&s;tian Spirit being almo&s;t departed from the earth, true Chri&s;tian knowledge, as its in&s;eparable compa|nion, is departed with it, and men &s;eem to be gone back again to their old animal life: and tho', in &s;peculation and idea, they profe&s;s an a&s;&s;ent to the truths of Revelation; yet, in heart and practice, they are to apt to con&s;ider the cour&s;e of all things as connected only with temporal good and evil, and them&s;elves as the center and circum|ference, the fir&s;t cau&s;e and the la&s;t end of all; a&s;cribing to human under&s;tanding de&s;igns which only Infinite Wi&s;dom can form, and to human power events which Omnipotence only can produce.</P>
<P>Le&s;t, therefore, this leaven of darkne&s;s, pride, and vanity, &s;hould have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and al|tered the frame and habit of our &s;pirits, it may not be improper to con&s;ider the &s;ucce&s;s of War in the fir&s;t general view, as the vi&s;ible effect of human power, in which even the profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;|tian is &s;o apt to glory as his own work.</P>
<P>If the Chri&s;tian, however, recollects him&s;elf, he will find War to be a &s;ad con&s;equence of the apo&s;ta&s;y and fall of man; when he was abandoned to the fury of his own lu&s;ts and pa&s;|&s;ions, as the natural and penal effect of breaking loo&s;e from the Divine Government, the funda|mental law of which is LOVE&mdash;<Q>Thou &s;halt love the <HI>LORD</HI> thy <HI>GOD</HI> with all thy heart,
<PB N="5" REF="010505_0004_0F80188370ACA1E0">
with all thy &s;oul, with all thy mind, and with all thy &s;trength; and thy <HI>FELLOW-CREATURE,</HI> as thy&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>St. James hath an&s;wered the que&s;tion with re|&s;pect to the cau&s;e of War, in &s;o preci&s;e and de|terminate a manner, as to preclude all difficulty and doubt about it: <Q><HI>From whence come wars and fightings among you,</HI> &s;ays he? <HI>Come they not hence, even of</HI> your lu&s;ts <HI>that war in your members. Ye kill, and de&s;ire to have, and can|not obtain: ye fight and war; yet ye have not, becau&s;e ye a&s;k not,</HI></Q>&mdash;becau&s;e ye have no re|&s;pect to the will of "THE LORD THAT REIGN|ETH;" but, for&s;aking the SUPREME GOOD, in whom alone your happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, ye follow an earthly and deceitful good, and think only of procuring it by your own power. <Q><HI>Ye a&s;k, and receive not; becau&s;e ye a&s;k ami&s;s</HI></Q> &mdash; from a pretended re&s;pect to "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH," but &s;olely for animal and &s;en&s;ual enjoyment, <HI>"that ye may</HI> con&s;ume it <HI>upon your</HI> lu&s;ts."</P>
<P>In this very explicit and true account, War, like all other evils, is de&s;cribed as centering in it&s;elf; and the end of it, is declared to be the gratification of tho&s;e very appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, from which it derives its birth. And thus it ever was, and ever will be &mdash; for in his unhappy circle, which is, indeed, the great circle of the hi&s;tory of man, the fatal mi&s;chief proceeds: War is the offspring of the in&s;eparable union between the &s;en&s;ual and malignant pa&s;&s;ions; War protracted

to a certain period, nece&s;&s;arily compels peace; peace revives and extends trade and commerce; trade and commerce give new life, vigour and &s;cope, to the &s;en&s;ual and malignant pa&s;&s;ions; and the&s;e naturally tend to generate another War.</P>
<P>But War, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is the premedi|tated and determined de&s;truction of human be|ings; of creatures originally <HI>"formed after the image of God,"</HI> and who&s;e pre&s;ervation, for that rea&s;on, is &s;ecured by Heaven it&s;elf within the fences of this righteous law, that <HI>"at the hand of every man's brother, the life of man &s;hall be required."</HI> And tho' this created image of the Holy Triune God mu&s;t be owned to have been &s;o wretchedly defaced, as to retain but a ve|ry faint re&s;emblance of its Divine original; yet, as the highe&s;t inforc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ent of that heavenly law, which was publi&s;hed for the &s;ecurity of life, it is mo&s;t graciou&s;ly renewed by the Incarnation of the Son of God, and the Indwelling of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Further: the con&s;equences of War, when im|partially examined, will be found big, not only with outward and temporal di&s;tre&s;s, but with an evil that extends where in the darkne&s;s and tumult of human pa&s;&s;ions it is neither expected nor conceive to reach. That property is con|founded, &s;cattered, and de&s;troyed; that laws are trampled under foot, government de&s;pi&s;ed, and the ties of all civil and dome&s;tic order broken into pieces; that fruitful countries are made de|&s;erts, and &s;tately cities a heap of ruins; that

matrons and virgins are violated; and neither the innocence of unoffending infancy, nor the impotence of decrepit age, a protection from the rage and thir&s;t for blood&mdash;is but the mortal pro|geny of this teeming womb of mi&s;chief. The wor&s;t is &s;till behind&mdash;and tho' remote from tho&s;e &s;en&s;es and pa&s;&s;ions that are exerci&s;ed only by pre&s;ent good and evil, and, therefore, not the object of common concern; mu&s;t yet, upon the lea&s;t recollection, impre&s;s with horrer every mind that believes there is a Righteous God, and a &s;tate of retribution that is to la&s;t for ever. But what mu&s;t the Chri&s;tian feel?&mdash;he, who knows that the fall of man is a fall from meekne&s;s, pu|rity, and love, into &s;en&s;uality, pride, and wrath; that the Son of God became incarnate, and &s;uf|fered, and died, to re&s;tore that fir&s;t life of meek|ne&s;s, purity, and love; and that for tho&s;e, in whom the re&s;toration of that life is not begun in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, the Son of God incarnate has, it is to be dreaded, &s;uffered and died in vain&mdash; what, I &s;ay, mu&s;t he feel for tho&s;e immortal &s;pi|rits, that, in the earlie&s;t dawn of their day of pu|rification, are by hundreds and thou&s;ands driven into eternity, in the bitterne&s;s of enmity and wrath &mdash; &s;ome inflamed with drunkenne&s;s; &s;ome fired with lu&s;t; and all &s;tained with blood? In tho&s;e direful conflicts, which are maintained with &s;o much rage, that when the Vanqui&s;hed at la&s;t retreats with the lo&s;s of TWENTY-THOUSAND HUMAN BEINGS, the Victor finds he has pur|cha&s;ed &s;ome little advantage at the expence of

MORE THAN HALF THAT NUMBER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SMOLLETT, in his Continuation of the Hi&s;tory of England, &s;peaking of the battle of Cunersdorf, where the Pru&s;&s;ians attacked the Mu&s;covites in the year 1759, &s;ays, <Q>The carnage was truly horrible; above twenty thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians lay dead on the field. The lo&s;s of the Ru&s;&s;ians amounted to ten thou&s;and. It mu&s;t be owned, that if the King was prodigal of his own per&s;on, he was likewi&s;e very free with the lives of his &s;ubjects.</Q> He adds: <Q>That at no time &s;ince the days of ignorance and barbarity, have the lives of men been &s;quandered away with &s;uch profu&s;ion as in the cour&s;e of this German war. They have not only been unnece&s;&s;arily &s;acrificed in various exploits of no con|&s;equence, but they have been lavi&s;hly expo&s;ed to all the rigour and di&s;temper of winter-campains,&mdash;in de&s;pite of nature, and in contempt of humanity.</Q></NOTE> &mdash; Heaven and earth! what a po&s;&s;ibility is here of a &s;acrifice made to <HI>the prince of darkne&s;s,</HI> the fir&s;t and chief apo&s;tate! who rejoices in beholding men, thro' the abu&s;e of tho&s;e benefits which un|de&s;erved Mercy has&punc; conferred upon them, trans|formed into enmity and hatred of God and their brethren; for&s;aken by God, and de&s;troying one another: and thus ha&s;tening once more into his horrid &s;ociety; that having been accomplices in his rebellion: they may become partakers of his mi&s;ery and torment.</P>
<P>Now, if the man of valour, whom con&s;enting nations have dignified with the title of HERO, and the man devoted to the world, are a&s;ked, from whence this immortal mi&s;chief, that may thus extend its influence into the regions of eternity, can proceed; what mu&s;t they an&s;wer?&mdash;indeed, what can they an&s;wer, but that it is engendered by the love of human glory&mdash;as vain a phantom

as&punc; ever play'd before a madman's eye! by the lu&s;t of dominion; the avarice of wealth; and the infamous ambition of being dreaded as the conquerors and tyrants of mankind? Heaven pre&s;erve Britain from the&s;e, <HI>"earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h"</HI> motives&mdash;&s;o repugnant to the gene|rous, compa&s;&s;ionate, and forgiving temper, with which Redeeming Mercy has ble&s;t it, in union with the purer beams of heavenly light; that light which is intended to remove all the darkne&s;s of human corruption, and transform &s;elfi&s;h, &s;en&s;ual, proud, and malignant &s;pirits, into Angels of patience, humility, meekne&s;s, purity, and love; the <HI>"children and heirs of God, the brethren and joint heirs of Chri&s;t!"</HI></P>
<P>But Britain, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e outward ad|vantages in which &s;he is &s;o apt to place her con|fidence, mu&s;t not forget, that there is no po&s;&s;ibi|lity of being pre&s;erved from &s;uch principles, dreadful and dete&s;table as they are, but by the mo&s;t humble, affectionate, and con&s;tant applica|tion to and dependance upon "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH," that Gracious Power which fir&s;t plucked them from her brea&s;t. It is, indeed, a &s;tanding ob&s;ervation among the prattlers of human philo&s;ophy, "that the mind mu&s;t be very weak, that cannot bear a pro&s;perous con|dition:" but where is the mind &s;trong enough to bear it, that is not ble&s;t from ABOVE with &s;omething better than pro&s;perity it&s;elf? That is not ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, which is &s;omething that can be &s;eparated from the mind; much le&s;s that, which
<PB N="10" REF="010505_0009_0F801888DBA8AC58">
may leave it mi&s;erable to all eternity; and lea&s;t of all that, which may tend to make it thus mi&s;e|rable, by degenerating into a cur&s;e. And this is the ca&s;e of all external things that are called ble&s;|&s;ings; which, in their own nature, are tem|porary and changeable, and in their u&s;e and ap|plication may be perverted to the mo&s;t danger|ous and la&s;ting evils: <Q>If ye will not lay it to heart, <HI>to give glory unto my name,</HI> &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts; I will even &s;ent a cur&s;e upon you, and I will <HI>CURSE YOUR BLSSINGS.</HI></Q> All external ble&s;&s;ings, whether national or per&s;onal, are cur&s;es, when they become the fuel of the &s;en|&s;ual and malignant fire in corrupt nature; when they not only alienate the mind from "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH," but madden it to impious rebellion and defiance again&s;t him.</P>
<P>From this view of war, begun from human pa&s;&s;ions, and carried on for human purpo&s;es, for honour, dominion, trade, or &s;ome other end that centers in the pre&s;ent life; it is evident, that the Chri&s;tian can have no intere&s;t in it: he cannot de|rive ble&s;&s;ing from its &s;ucce&s;s, nor triumph and exult when to the &s;hort-&s;ighted view of the hu|man mind the appearance of &s;ucce&s;s pre&s;ents it|&s;elf; he knows, that the means are infinitely di&s;proportionate to the end; and his Redeemer him&s;elf has declared, that <HI>"all they that take the &s;word,"</HI> inflamed by malignity, and &s;eeking &s;ome earthly and temporal good, <HI>"&s;hall peri&s;h with the &s;word."</HI> But, without any circum|&s;tances of limitation, the &s;ame Redeemer, in the
<PB N="11" REF="010505_0010_0F80188970D68870">
Revelation of his future judgments upon a fallen and ob&s;tinately evil world, has further declared, that <Q><HI>he that leadeth into captivity, &s;hall go into captivity; and he that killeth with the &s;word, mu&s;t be killed with the &s;word: Here is the</HI> trial of the <HI>faith and patience of the &s;aints,</HI></Q> who, being called to a &s;tate of &s;uffering, and treading in the foot&s;teps of their great Examplar, <Q><HI>when they are reviled, revile not again; when they &s;uffer, threaten not; but commit them&s;elves to</HI> THE LORD THAT REIGNETH, <HI>to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly.</HI></Q> And to this &s;olemn de|claration of righteous judgment, the penman of that awful book calls upon all mankind to attend, and &s;ays, <HI>"If any man have an ear,"</HI> an ear that is not totally deafened by the tumultuous pa&s;|&s;ions of nature, &s;eparated from God, and turned wholly to it&s;elf, <HI>"let him</HI> now <HI>hear;"</HI> let him now repent, and for&s;aking his own &s;en&s;ual and malignant will, &s;eek after the GOD of PEACE and LOVE, and live.</P>
<P>We will, therefore, turn our attention to the only light in which Succce&s;s in War can proper|ly be con&s;idered by us, namely, As the &s;ole work of "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH"&mdash; a part of the admini&s;tration of that Merciful Pro|vidence, which, thro' all the revolutions of di&s;|ordered nature and di&s;ordered life, pur&s;ues but one invariable purpo&s;e, the Redemption and Sal|vation of man.</P>
<P>The di&s;orders of nature and of life are wholly
<PB N="12" REF="010505_0011_0F80188A52690B10">
the effects of &s;in; of a voluntary aver&s;ion and alienation from the life, light, and love of God, in perfect union with which, perfect purity, peace, and happinene&s;s are only to be found. Hence that di&s;cordancy of the outward elements, which brings forth pe&s;tilence, famine, inundations, earthquakes, &s;torms, and tempe&s;ts: hence, in the corporal part of the human frame, pain, &s;ickne&s;s, and death; in the mental, &s;en&s;uality, pride, and malignity, including all the &s;elfi&s;h and wrathful pa&s;&s;ions, that, between individuals, engender en|vy, hatred, injury, re&s;entment and revenge, and between nations a peculiar kind of enmity and wrong that i&s;&s;ues in war. In the elements &s;trife and evil will &s;ub&s;i&s;t, 'till they are purified and united by the la&s;t renovating fire; in man, 'till all the de&s;igns of Grace are fully accompli&s;hed: but &s;urrounded with evil as men are, and full of evil them&s;elves, what would become of the whole wretched race at any given in&s;tant of time, at this very moment for example, if the effects of that evil were not continually &s;u&s;pended and di|rected by Infinite Power, &s;o as to become con|tinually &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of Infinite Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Love, in Univer&s;al Redemption.</P>
<P>The nature of that Redemption it would be needle&s;s to mention, if in this age of levity we were not &s;o apt to forget it. It is, in general, a full re&s;toration of the life of God in the &s;oul; that Life of Father Son and Holy Spirit, which was once the life and perfection of fallen angels
<PB N="13" REF="010505_0012_0F80188AEC436008">
and fallen man; which is and only can be the life and perfection of all holy angels; and which the Son of God has been re&s;toring to human na|ture from the time in which Adam fell.</P>
<P>When the Son of God became incarnate, what was implied in this Redemption as the effect of its influence upon man, was fully evident from His doctrine and His life; namely, the conque&s;t and renunciation of the world, and the death of the will and all the appetites and pa&s;&s;ions of fal|len animal nature, thro' faith in HIS NAME&mdash; not an hi&s;torical and &s;peculative faith, a meer ra|tional a&s;&s;ent to the truth of a well-atte&s;ted hi&s;tory of facts and doctrines; but a full, ardent, con|tinual <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of the LIFE OF CHRIST, as begot|ten and formed in the &s;oul by the continual ope|ration of the Holy Gho&s;t. Thus, what was at fir&s;t the Per&s;onal duties of &s;ingle Chri&s;tians, when they were &s;cattered over the face of the earth, and were only parts of different nations; became afterwards National duties, when whole nations became Chri&s;tians. <HI>If, therefore,</HI> <Q>to love an ene|my, to forgive him, do him good, <HI>and</HI> pray for him</Q>&mdash; <HI>if to</HI> "overcome the world", <HI>who&s;e power con&s;i&s;ts in</HI> <Q>the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life</Q> &mdash; <HI>are Chri&s;tian Per&s;onal duties; if, to</HI> <Q>love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our &s;oul, with all our mind, and with all our &s;trength, and our fellow-creatures as our&s;elves,</Q>&mdash;<HI>is the purity and per|fection of the Chri&s;tian Per&s;onal life; the &s;ame mu&s;t al&s;o be true of Chri&s;tian National life and
<PB N="14" REF="010505_0013_0F80188BB16B3EC0">
duty:</HI> for a Chri&s;tian nation differs no otherwi&s;e from a Chri&s;tian per&s;on, than as the whole differs from one of the parts of which it e&s;&s;entially con|&s;i&s;ts; and is only the aggregated body of tho&s;e &s;ingle per&s;ons, on whom univer&s;ally &s;uch duties are enjoined, from whom univer&s;ally &s;uch per|fection is required.</P>
<P>But, to this perfect and heavenly life and duty, War is repugnant, in its cau&s;e, in it&s;elf, and in its con&s;equences: it can be but comparatively irrepugnant, with re&s;pect to the degrees of its own evil; and the more or le&s;s it partakes of the malignity of animal pa&s;&s;ions, and the &s;en&s;uality of animal views, the more or le&s;s obnoxious mu&s;t it render a people to the &s;evere judgments of "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH."</P>

<P>This is the language of the whole New-Te&s;ta|ment. You are to be dead to the world, and to live a new life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord. But not|with&s;tanding the clearne&s;s and plainne&s;s of the&s;e doctrines by which believers in Chri&s;t are required thus to renounce the world, yet great part of the Chri&s;tians live and die &s;laves to the cu&s;toms and tempers of the world. <HI>Learn of me,</HI> &s;aith our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>for I am meek and lowly in heart,

Now this meek, this lowly &s;tate, that con&s;titutes the true re&s;t of the &s;oul, cnnnot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in any mind, but &s;o far as it is thus dead to the world, and has parted with all de&s;ires of enjoying all its riches, plea&s;ures and honours. So that in or|der to be truly humble, you mu&s;t unlearn all the&s;e notions, which you have been all your life learning, from this corrupt &s;pirit of the world. You can make no &s;tand again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of pride, the meek affections of humility can have no place in your &s;ouls, till you &s;top the power of the world over you, and re&s;olve again&s;t a blind obedience to its laws. And when you are once advanced thus far, as to be able to &s;tand &s;till in the torrent of worldly fa&s;hions, and opinions, and examine the worth and value of things, which are mo&s;t admired and valued in the world, you have gone a great way in the gaining of your freedom, and have laid a good foundation for the amendment of your heart. Think upon the rich, the great, and the learned per&s;ons, that have made great figures, and been high in the e&s;teem of the world; many of them died in your time, and yet they are &s;unk, and lo&s;t, and gone, and as much di&s;regarded by the world, as if they had been only &s;o many bubles of water. And is it worth your while to lo&s;e the &s;malle&s;t degree of virtue, for the &s;ake of plea&s;ing &s;o bad a ma&s;ter, and &s;o fal&s;e a friend, as the world is.

<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>gave him&s;elf for our &s;ins, that he might deliver us from this pre|&s;ent evil world.</HI> Gal. i. 4.

This is the de&s;cription of the followers of Chri&s;t; and it is proof enough, that no people are to be reckon'd Chri&s;tians in reality, who in their hearts and tempers belong to this world. <HI>We know,</HI> &s;aith the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, <HI>that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedne&s;s.</HI> Chap. v. 19. Chri&s;tians therefore can no farther know that they are of God, than &s;o far as they know they are not of the world, that is, that they don't live according to the ways and &s;pirit of the world. And he is only of God, or born of God, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who has overcome this world, that is, who has cho&s;en to live by faith, and go|vern his actions by the principles of a wi&s;dom revealed from God, by Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>They are not of this world, as I am not of this world,</HI> &s;ays

our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. This is the &s;tate of Chri&s;ti|anity with regard to this world, the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tians requiring them to live as citizens of the new Jeru&s;alem, and to have their conver&s;ation in heaven. If you are not thus out of, and contrary to the world, you want the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of Chri&s;tianity; you don't belong to Chri&s;t, but by being out of the world, as he was out of it. We may deceive our&s;elves; if we plea&s;e, with vain, and &s;oftning comments upon the&s;e words; but they are, and will be under&s;tood in their fir&s;t &s;implicity, and plainne&s;s, by every one that reads them in the &s;ame &s;pirit, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;poke them.

<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;uffered, and was a &s;a|crifice, to make our &s;uffering, and &s;acrifice of our&s;elves fit to be received by God.

The nece&s;&s;ity of this conformity to all that Chri&s;t did, and &s;uffered upon our account is very plain from the whole tenor of &s;cripture. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to his &s;uffer|ings, this is the only condition of our being &s;aved by them. <HI>If we &s;uffer with him, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him.</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 11. <HI>Secondly,</HI> As to his crucifixion, <HI>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him.</HI> Rom. vi. 6.

Chri&s;t is not crucified in our &s;tead; but unle&s;s our old man be really crucified with him, the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t will profit us nothing. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to the death of Chri&s;t, the condition is this: <HI>If we be dead with Chri&s;t, we believe that we &s;hall al&s;o live with him,</HI> vers 8. If therefore Chri&s;t be dead alone, if we are not dead with him, we are as &s;ure from this &s;cripture, that we &s;hall not live with him. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> As to the re&s;ur|rection of Chri&s;t, the &s;cripture &s;heweth us, how we are to partake of the benefit of it: <HI>If ye be ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, &s;eek tho&s;e things which are above, where Chri&s;t &s;itteth on the right hand of God.</HI> Col. iii. 1.

This is the &s;tate of &s;epara|tion from the world, to which all orders of Chri&s;|tians are called. They mu&s;t &s;o far renounce all wordly tempers, be &s;o far governed by the things of another life, as to &s;hew, that they are truly and really crucified, dead, and ri&s;en with Chri&s;t. <HI>If any man be in Chri&s;t he is a new creature, old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, behold all things are be|come new.</HI> 2 Cor. v. 17.</P>

world; they &s;aw with the eyes of heaven, that darkne&s;s was not more contrary to light, than the &s;pirit and wi&s;dom of this world was contrary to divine wi&s;dom: Therefore they allowed of no progre&s;s in virtue, but &s;o far as a man had over|come him&s;elf, and the &s;pirit of this world. This gave a divine &s;olidity to all their in&s;tructions, and proved them to be ma&s;ters of true wi&s;dom. But the doctrine of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the la&s;t, the highe&s;t, the mo&s;t fini&s;hing &s;troke given to the &s;pirit of this world, that &s;peaks more in one word, than all the philo&s;ophy of voluminous writers, is yet profe&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e, who are in more friend&s;hip with the world, than was allowed to the di&s;ciples of Pithagoras, Socrates, Plato or Epictetus. Nay, if tho&s;e ancient Sages were to &s;tart up among&s;t us with their divine wi&s;dom, they would bid fair to be treated by the &s;ons of the go&s;pel, if not by &s;ome Fathers of the church, as dreaming Enthu&s;ia&s;ts. But, this is a &s;tanding truth, the world can only love its own, and wi&s;|dom can only be ju&s;tified of her children. The heaven-born Epictetus told one of his &s;cholars, <HI>That then he might fir&s;t look upon him&s;elf as having made &s;ome true proficiency in virtue, when the world took him for a fool</HI>; an oracle&punc; like that, which &s;aid, the wi&s;dom of this world is fooli&s;h|ne&s;s with God.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k what is the apo&s;ta&s;y of the&s;e la&s;t times, or whence is all the degeneracy of the pre|&s;ent Chri&s;tian church, it mu&s;t be placed to a

worldly &s;pirit. If here you &s;ee open wickedne&s;s, there only form of godline&s;s, if here &s;uperficial holine&s;s, political piety, there haughty &s;anctity, partial zeal, if almo&s;t every where, you &s;ee a Jewi&s;h blindne&s;s, and hardne&s;s of heart, and the church trading with the go&s;pel, as vi&s;ibly, as the old Jews bought and &s;old bea&s;ts in their temple, all this is only &s;o many forms, and proper fruits of the worldly &s;pirit. This is the great net, with which the devil becomes a fi&s;her of men; and be a&s;&s;ured of this, that every &s;on of man is in this net, till through, and by the Spirit of Chri&s;t he breaks out of it. I &s;ay the Spirit of Chri&s;t, for nothing el&s;e can deliver him from it. If you tru&s;t to any kind or form of religious ob&s;ervances, to any kind of learning, or effort of human pru|dence, and then I will tell you what your ca&s;e will be, you will overcome one temper of the world, only and merely by cleaving to another: For nothing can overcome or renounce the world, but &s;ingly and &s;olely the Spirit of Chri&s;t. Hence it is, that many learned men with all the rich furniture of their brain live and die &s;laves to the &s;pirit of this world, the Spirit of Chri&s;t is not the only thing that is the de&s;ire of their hearts, and therefore their learning only works in and with the &s;pirit of this world, and becomes it&s;elf no &s;mall parts of the vanity of vanities.</P>
<P>Would you know the evil nature and effect of a &s;pirit given up to the world, and not &s;ubjected to the Spirit of Grace: you need only look at

the ble&s;&s;ed effect of a continual &s;tate of watching, a continual humble application to God in the true &s;pirit of prayer, for the one goes downwards with the &s;ame &s;trength, as the other goes up|ward, the one betroths, and weds to an earthly nature, with the &s;ame certainty, as the other e&s;pou&s;es, and unites to Chri&s;t. The &s;pirit of continual watchings and prayer, is a pre&s;&s;ing forth of the &s;oul out of this earthly life, it is a &s;tretch|ing with all its de&s;ire after the life of God, it is a leaving as far as it can, all its own &s;pirit, to re|ceive a &s;pirit from above, to be one life, one love, one &s;pirit with Chri&s;t in God. This prayer, which is an emptying it&s;elf of all its own lu&s;ts and natural tempers, and an opening it&s;elf for the light and love of God to enter into it, is the prayer in the Name of Chri&s;t, to which nothing is denied; for the love which God bears to the &s;oul, is an eternal never cea&s;ing de&s;ire to open the birth of his holy word and &s;pirit in it, and &s;tays no longer till the door of the heart open for Him; and nothing does or can keep God out of the &s;oul, or hinder his union with it, but the de&s;ire of the heart turned from it. What the &s;oul de&s;ireth, that is the fewel of its fire, and as its fewel is, &s;o is the flame of its life. As we &s;ow we &s;hall reap; if to the &s;pirit, we &s;hall reap life and peace; if to the fle&s;h, we &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption.

Since this is the ca&s;e, let us &s;top a while, let our hearing be turned into feeling. Let us con&s;ider, whether there is any thing in life, that de&s;erves a thought, but how to keep in a con|tinual &s;tate of watching and prayer, that we may attain to that purity of heart, which alone can &s;ee, find and po&s;&s;e&s;s God.</P>

<P>The way to any good degree of perfection in
<PB N="26" REF="010505_0025_0F801896ED845800">
the divine life, lies thro' great mortification and &s;elf-denial: Some think it enough to get doctrines into the head; but till the heart is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure purified by faith, nothing is rightly done: and in order to this, the children of Anak, (tho&s;e corrupt pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations that war again&s;t the &s;oul) mu&s;t be driven out, the perver&s;ene&s;s of the will broken, the under&s;tanding &s;implified, the pride of our hearts pluckt up by the roots, and all the cords that bind us to the world, and the things of it, untwi&s;ted; in a word, our idols mu&s;t be ca&s;t out, and every cur&s;ed thing re|moved that &s;eparates betwixt God and us; for the pure in heart, and they only, &s;hall &s;ee God. It was by this kind of holy violence practi&s;ed on them&s;elves, that the worthies both of the Old and New Te&s;tament, in all ages of the church, have laid hold on the kingdom of heaven, been favoured with &s;uch rich communications from God, and enabled to work &s;uch wonders as &s;urpa&s;s the be|lief of many in this degenerate incredulous age: And that a preparatory di&s;cipline of &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity is nece&s;&s;ary in order to qualify us for any extraordinary vouch&s;afements of illumi|nation and grace, we may learn from the &s;chools in&s;tituted among the Jews for the training up of per&s;ons for the prophetic office, where they were educated in great ab&s;traction from the world, in the government of their pa&s;&s;ions, and the mor|tification of their natural propen&s;ions, that being &s;o di&s;engaged from the common impediments of

But the Chri&s;tian knows no &s;uch &s;traitne&s;s; for his bowels are enlarged towards all that will come within the embraces of his charity, which is as wide as the ea&s;t is from the we&s;t.
