</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR CHARLES, the &s;ubject of this hi&s;tory, was the only &s;on of &s;ir Thomas Grandi&s;on, a per&s;on fond of magnificence and &s;plendor: who va|lued him&s;elf on his breed of race hor|&s;es and hunters, and on his kenne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in which he was prodigiou&s;ly extra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|gant. He inherited from his fathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> in England, which brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 6000l. a year, and another in Ireland, worth about 2000l. per annum, be|&s;ides
<PB N="4" REF="022852_0003_0FBA9D1E1424F798">
a very con&s;iderable fortune in money. His lady, who was of a no|ble family, al&s;o brought him a great fortune. She was a mo&s;t excellent wo|man, to whom he was a complai&s;ant, but carele&s;s hu&s;band. Soon after his marriage, giving way to his predomi|nant inclination for plea&s;ure, he en|tirely left the care of the family to her: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> applied her|&s;elf to the dome&s;tic duties: finding that &s;he could not prevail on &s;ir Tho|mas to reduce his expen&s;es, &s;he thought it prudent to u&s;e her utmo&s;t endea|vours to enable him to &s;upport them, without di&s;credit to him&s;elf, or any vi&s;ible injury to his family. Yet this lady, while &s;he u&s;ed the be&s;t oecono|my, was free from all narrow, mean, and &s;elfi&s;h views. She was beloved for her benevolence and genero&s;ity, and idolized by her poor neighbours. She had a plentiful table, and was ex|tremely ho&s;pitable, both from her na|tural goodne&s;s, and to give credit to her hu&s;band. By this excellent lady, &s;ir Thomas had a &s;on and two daugh|ters, who received from her the be&s;t part of their education, &s;he in&s;tilling

into their young minds the fir&s;t princi|ples of chri&s;tianity, and &s;trong ideas of moral rectitude.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas, con&s;idering his daugh|ters as an incumbrance, grew extreme|ly fond of his &s;on, and placing all his affections on him, was de&s;irous of his becoming ma&s;ter of every accompli&s;h|ment. He early filled his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with high notions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he had reached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> year, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|vided him a ma&s;ter to in&s;truct him in the &s;cience of defence: hence the amiable youth soon acquired &s;uch &s;kill in the weapons, as gave th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> greate&s;t &s;atisfaction both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his father and ma&s;|ter.

His excellent mother, however, tremble for the ef|fects of their prai&s;es, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dread|ed, might render him too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ble to take off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">, and to re&s;ent it with the &s;word, to the danger of his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">is future peace of mind; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on had the misfortune to lo&s;e this be&s;t of mothers while young: but it was&punc; by a circum&s;tance that deeply imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ed all her le&s;&s;ons on his heart. His father was brought home, as it was thought, mortally wounded in a duel, when this good la|dy's &s;urpri&s;e threw her into fits, from which &s;he was never after free, and the danger in which &s;ir Thomas con|tinued for a con&s;iderable time, with her extraordinary &s;olicitude and care in attending him night and day, broke her con&s;titution, and brought her into an ill &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of heal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h, which &s;oon pro|ved fatal. A few hours before this ex|cellent lady expired, after having, on general principles, warmly recom|mended to her children, duty to their father, and brotherly and &s;i&s;terly love, as nece&s;&s;ary to their happine&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he had a private di&s;cour&s;e with her &s;on,

on the &s;ame &s;ubject, in which, with great affection, &s;he recommended his &s;i&s;ters to him: they entering at this in&s;tant, found him in tears, when the am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">able youth, taking each of their hands, kneeled down, and put them into his mother's extended dy|ing hand: then bowing his face up|on all three, he cried, all, madam&mdash;all my deare&s;t, be&s;t of mothers that you have enjoined&mdash;He was un|able to proceed; but their arms were bedewed with his tears.

Then lifting up her head, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed him, and repeated her ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>Upon her dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h, the engaging youth became incon&s;olable. He loved his father, but had been more particular|ly fond of his mother.

<P>THE young gentleman being &s;eized with a deep melancholy on his &s;uffering &s;o irreparable a lo&s;s, his fa|ther, who was al&s;o greatly grieved, (and the more &s;o, as he could not help reproaching him&s;elf for having, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, been the occa&s;ion of that lo&s;s) yielded to the entreaties of

<P>Creutzer, though recommended by his uncle, &s;oon convinced mr. Gran|di&s;on, that he was a mo&s;t abandoned profligate. The young gentleman had, however, the happine&s;s, by his pru|dence, to e&s;cape &s;everal &s;nares, which this artful wretch laid for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s virtue, from the hopes, that if he could betray him into them, he &s;hould &s;ilence his remon&s;trances again&s;t his own had conduct, and prevent his complaining of him in his letters to &s;ir Thomas.</P>
<P>When they were at Turin, mr. Grandi&s;on commenced an acquaint|ance with dr. Bartlett, governor to mr. Lorimer, a young gentleman, with whom mr. Creutzer became ex|tremely intimate: and the two for|mer

<P>The worthy youth, who had often in vain threatened to complain of him to his father, then &s;ent to inform him of the profl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gacy and abandoned prin|ciples of the man who had been placed over him, in order to direct his con|du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and to intreat h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m to appoint him ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her governor, or permit h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m to return to England, till he had cho|&s;en one for him.

When he &s;aw him again, he &s;et before him the example of mr. Grandi&s;on, a much younger man; and endeavoured to in&s;pire him with emulation, by reading to him &s;ome of mr. Grandi|&s;on's letters. But all the effect the&s;e had upon him, was to increa&s;e his aver&s;ion both to his governor and to that gentleman.

<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on &s;tayed with him till he was fit to be removed from Cre|mona, where he was vi&s;ited by the whole family.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The count of Belvedere falls in love with Clementina, whom mr. Gran|di&s;on admires, yet is de&s;ired to talk to her in that nobleman's favour. That lady is &s;u&s;pected to be in love with mr.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Barone was no longer re|moved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Bologna, than the whole family appeared &s;tudious to get mr. Grandi&s;on among them. The general made him promi&s;e, when his relations, as he termed them, at Bo|logna, could part with him, to favour them with his company at Naples.</P>
<P>In &s;uch company mr. Grandi&s;on could not fail of pa&s;&s;ing his time very agreeably. He was particularly ho|noured with the confidence of the
<PB N="34" REF="022852_0033_0FBA9D571639BE38">
marchione&s;s, who opened her heart to him on every material occurrence that pre&s;ented it&s;elf. Her lord, who is di&s;tingui&s;hed by his politene&s;s, was never better plea&s;ed than when he found them together: and frequently, though they were not engaged in lec|tures, the lovely Clementina claimed a right to be pre&s;ent with her mother.</P>
<P>Things were in this &s;ituation, when the young count of Belvedere, who had received his education in Spain, returned to Parma; and paying a vi|&s;it to this noble family, &s;aw and loved Clementina. As the count was not only a man of &s;en&s;e, but had a hand&s;ome per&s;on, and a great fortune; they all thought that his alliance was very de&s;irable. The marquis highly approved of it, and the marchione&s;s had &s;everal conver&s;ations with mr. Grandi&s;on on this &s;ubject. She thought it nece&s;&s;ary to know his thoughts on the occa&s;ion, as the barone, unknown to him, had frequently declared, that he thought there was no other way of rewarding his merit, than by giving him a relation to the family. In the mean time, mr. Grandi&s;on, thus
<PB N="35" REF="022852_0034_0FBA9D588FFACE18">
di&s;tingui&s;hed by all the per&s;ons of this noble hou&s;e, and a daily witne&s;s of the innumerable excellencies of the lovely Clementina, found it impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;uffer his vanity to be &s;ome|times awakened, and to &s;tifle his wi&s;hes of obtaining &s;uch a prize. But he endeavoured to check the plea&s;ing idea, the moment he found it play a|bout his heart; for he would have thought any attempt to recommend him&s;elf to the young lady's favour, though only by his looks and a&s;&s;iduities, a breach of that generous tru&s;t and confidence which they all repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on now formed the re&s;olution of retiring from Italy, and vi&s;iting &s;ome of the German courts. This he communicated to the Mar|chione&s;s, who expre&s;&s;ed her concern at the thoughts of his leaving them, and prevailed on him to defer his de|parture for &s;ome time; but hinted her and her lord's apprehen&s;ions of his being in love with Clementina. He convinced her, that he had behaved with the utmo&s;t honour in this parti|cular: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;o fully &s;atisfied the

The young lady and mr. Grandi&s;on had a conference on this &s;ubject, while the marquis and marchione&s;s, unknown to either of them, had placed them|&s;elves to li&s;ten to their di&s;cour&s;e in a clo&s;et adjoining to the room, and which communicated to another room, as well as to that they were in. How|ever, they had not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with their conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The time of mr. Grandi&s;on's de|parture now drawing near, and the young lady repeatedly refu&s;ing the count of Belvedere, the barone, un|known to his friend, declared in his favour. His relations objected diffi|culties with re&s;pect to his religion and his country; on which he de&s;ired they would permit his talking to him on tho&s;e &s;ubjects, and di&s;cour&s;ing with his &s;i&s;ter on her motives for refu&s;ing the count of Belvedere; but this they would not allow. The Marchione&s;s her&s;elf undertook to talk to her daugh|ter, and to demand of her, her rea|&s;ons

for di&s;liking all the propo&s;als that had been made her; but on her clo&s;et|ting the lovely Clementina, nothing was to be had from her but tears. A &s;ilence, that had not the lea&s;t appear|ance of fullenne&s;s, had for &s;ome days, &s;hown, that a deep melancholy had begun to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind; and yet &s;he appeared extremely of|fended at their attributing it to love. However, her mother informed mr. Grandi&s;on, that &s;he could not help &s;u&s;pecting, that, unknown to her&s;elf, &s;he was under the dominion of that pa&s;&s;ion, from her never appearing chearful, but when taking le&s;&s;ons for learning a language that was never likely to be of the lea&s;t &s;ervice to her. Her melancholy &s;till encrea&s;ing, he was de&s;ired to talk with her. He did &s;o, and it was ob&s;erved, that &s;he ge|nerally a&s;&s;umed a chearful air, while he was pre&s;ent; and though &s;he &s;aid little, appeared plea&s;ed with every thing he &s;aid to her; but the moment he left her, &s;he &s;tudied to find opportu|nities of being alone. Her parents, who were in the deepe&s;t affliction, con&s;ult|ed phy&s;icians, who all declared, that

<P>On the evening before the day ap|pointed for mr. Grandi&s;on's depar|ture, this noble family made a &s;plendid entertainment in honour of a gue&s;t, who had laid them under &s;uch extra|ordinary obligations. For they had the more readily brought them&s;elves to approve of his leaving them, from their de&s;ire to know how it would af|fect Clementina. That lady appeared at table, and during the whole even|ing, &s;upported her part of the conver|&s;ation with extraordinary vivacity; and yet there appeared nothing in her looks or behaviour, that &s;eemed the lea&s;t affected. When they thanked him for the plea&s;ure he gave the whole fa|mily, &s;he joined her acknowledgments; and when they expre&s;&s;ed their wi&s;hes to &s;ee him again before he returned to England, &s;he did the &s;ame. Mr. Grandi&s;on's heart was dilated, and he was overjoyed at &s;eeing &s;uch a hap|py

The next morning mr.

<P>In the city of Florence is a family of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and honour, the ladies of which have a female friend who lives with them, named Beau|mont, who in the early part of life, was defrauded of her fortune by an uncle. She is an Engli&s;h prote&s;tant, and is greatly e&s;teemed for her genius, and the goodne&s;s of her heart. The&s;e ladies with this their companion, were one day vi&s;iting at marche&s;e della Porretta's, when the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother told them the mournful tale; and they thinking nothing that could be effect|ed by human prudence impo&s;&s;ible to mrs.

Her hopes that his ab&s;ence would re&s;tore her tranquillity, had made her behave with &s;uch &s;teadine&s;s at his departure; but &s;he was not able to maintain &s;o great a part; yet &s;he profe&s;&s;ed, that &s;he would never marry one who by his religion was an enemy to the faith, in which &s;he had never wavered; and which, &s;he ob&s;erved, &s;he would never change, were an earthly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be placed on the head of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">an &s;he loved, to be the reward.</P>

This news greatly affected mr. Grandi&s;on; for, from his knowledge of the lady and the whole family, he was afraid the articles of re&s;idence and religion would not be ea&s;ily compromi&s;ed; on which account he &s;ummoned up all his pru|dence to keep alive his fears and &s;u&s;|pend every flattering hope.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="022852_0044_0FBA9D6C52732500">
He in&s;tantly returned to Bologna, where, on his arrival, he was received with all the marks of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem by the marquis and the bi&s;hop. The barone, who &s;till kept his chamber, embracing him, &s;aid, now is the affair I have &s;o long had in view, determined. O chevalier, you'll be a happy man. Clementina will be yours, and you will be Clementina's. Now do I indeed embrace my brother&mdash;But I won't detain you; ha&s;te to the happy girl, who is with her mother; and both are ready to welcome you. Mr. Grandi&s;on was then conducted into the marchione&s;s's drawing room, where he found that lady richly dre&s;&s;|ed, with the lovely Clementina al&s;o elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;tanding by her chair; while her natural mode&s;ty, heightened by a glowing con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s that &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the oc|ca&s;ion, gave her advantages &s;uperior to her riche&s;t jewels. The marchio|ne&s;s behaved to him with great ten|derne&s;s and re&s;pect, apologized for her daughter's &s;ilence and confu&s;ion; and on her returning, congratulated him on the happine&s;s intended him, ob|&s;erving
<PB N="46" REF="022852_0045_0FBA9D6E1346E020">
that &s;he would leave particular &s;ubjects to be di&s;cour&s;ed of between the bi&s;hop and him, adding that as much &s;hould be done for Clementina, as if &s;he had married the man they wi&s;hed her to have, when they ima|gined her affections entirely di&s;en|gaged. Mr. Grandi&s;on applauded her goodne&s;s, and &s;he added, that &s;he did not doubt of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oving Clementina more than any other lady. He return|ed, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he had never &s;een one he could have loved with &s;uch tenderne&s;s, had he not put a re&s;traint upon him|&s;elf, from the high notions they enter|tained of their rank and quality, from the difference of religion; and from the confidence the family repo&s;ed in him. He therefore a&s;&s;ured the mar|chione&s;s, that not having pre&s;umed to encourage hopes of the happine&s;s that now &s;eemed to await him, he could hardly yet flatter him&s;elf that he &s;hould enjoy &s;uch felicity. She an&s;wered, that he de&s;erved it all. He knew the value they had for him. Clementina's regard was founded on virtue: and &s;he did not doubt, but all that depend|ed on him would, as well from gene|ro&s;ity

as gratitude, be complied with. The marquis, who entered &s;oon after, behaved with the &s;ame indulgence, letting him know, that his &s;on the bi&s;hop, would di&s;cour&s;e with him up|on terms. A great fortune, be&s;ides a noble e&s;tate bequeathed her by her two grand-fathers, was propo&s;ed, and his father was to be invited over to grace their nuptials.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop at la&s;t made the dreaded propo&s;als, with which, neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;cience, nor his love for his coun|try would &s;uffer him to comply. He was to make a formal renunciation of his religion, and to &s;ettle in Italy, and only be allowed once in two or three years to go to England, if he plea&s;ed, for two or three months; and, if their daughter &s;hould de&s;ire it, &s;he might, once in her life, be carried thither on a vi&s;it of curio&s;ity, and &s;tay there the time they &s;hould limit.

He even reproached him with ob|&s;tinacy, ingratitude, and cruelty. The

general, who was now at Bologna, raved, threatened, and treated him with contempt, while the marquis be|gan to con&s;ider him as unworthy of the honour de&s;igned him. In what di&s;tre&s;s was mr. Grandi&s;on involved, in being thus obliged to deny him&s;elf the dear|e&s;t wi&s;h of his heart, and to di&s;ap|point the warm expectations of tho&s;e who had a &s;incere value for him! But when his dear Jeronymo intreated his compliance&mdash;when the tender mother intreated him to have pity on her heart, and her poor child's head&mdash;and when the gentle, the lovely Clemen|tina urged him for his &s;oul's &s;ake, to embrace the doctrines of her holy mo|ther the church, how was his mind torn by the contending pa&s;&s;ions, which tortured his brea&s;t? But he was fully &s;atisfied with his own faith, and had in&s;uperable objections to that which they de&s;ired him to embrace; and, if he complied, his con&s;cience and his country were to be the &s;acrifice. Yet he &s;tudied for a compromi&s;e. Clemen|tina was very dear to him, and he then beheld graces in her, which he had hitherto &s;truggled to behold with in|difference.
<PB N="49" REF="022852_0048_0FBA9D7396DF2DC8">
He propo&s;ed to live one year in Italy, and one in England by turns, if their dear Clementina would con&s;ent to live with him there; if not, he propo&s;ed to pa&s;s only three months in every year in his native country. He offered to leave her entirely at her liberty in the article of religion; and, in ca&s;e of children by the marriage, the daughters to be educated by her, and the &s;ons by him; a condition, to which the pope him&s;elf, it was pre&s;u|med, would not refu&s;e his &s;anction. To this, the unhappy Clementina would have con&s;ented, and earne&s;tly endeavoured to procure the con&s;ent of her friends. But no arguments could prevail on them to allow their daugh|ter to marry a prote&s;tant. This deter|mination was followed by the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;cenes; the mother, indeed, &s;eemed in a manner neutral; and the barone remained &s;till firm in mr. Gran|di&s;on's intere&s;t; but the marquis, the general, the bi&s;hop, and the whole Urbino branch of the family, were im|movable. The general treated him even with an in&s;olent arrogance; and imagining that mr. Grandi&s;on had u&s;ed

The rigour of their behaviour was now extended even to the unhap|py Clementina: and mr. Grandi&s;on in vain recommended their treating her with indulgence. He was de&s;ired to depart from Bologna; and Clemen|tina was not permitted to &s;ee him, though &s;he begged on her knees to have a parting interview. At hearing of his being gone, her grief moved every one to pity, and this &s;ub&s;ided into fits, the deepe&s;t melancholy and &s;ilence.</P>

<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on &s;aves mr. Danby's life. The manner in which &s;ir Tho|mas Grandi&s;on lived while his &s;on was on his travels.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Grandi&s;on no &s;ooner left Italy than he proceeded to Paris, to wait there for orders from
<PB N="51" REF="022852_0050_0FBA9D76E8099A70">
his father, to return to his native coun|try. While he was in France, he paid a vi&s;it to mr. Danby, an eminent mer|chant of great integrity, to whom his father remitted money for his u&s;e. With this gentleman, he had been be|fore acquainted: and having now &s;pent two days with him in the city, he ac|companied him to a little lone hou&s;e in the Cambre&s;is, which that gentle|man u&s;ed to term his dormitory. Mr. Grandi&s;on had only one &s;ervant with him, who lay in a little room over the &s;table, with a man &s;ervant of mr. Danby's, there being conveniencies in the hou&s;e only for mr. Danby, a friend and two women &s;ervants. About mid+night, mr. Grandi&s;on was alarmed by hearing a noi&s;e at the window of mr. Danby's room, when, in&s;tantly &s;lip|ping on his cloaths, and drawing his &s;word, he ran thither, ju&s;t as a villain with a large knife in his hand, had &s;eized mr. Danby's throat, who till then was &s;ound a&s;leep. The &s;kin of his neck, and one of his hands, which he had lifted up to defend him&s;elf, were &s;lightly wounded, when Mr. Grandi|&s;on run the ruffian into the &s;houlder
<PB N="52" REF="022852_0051_0FBA9D782624ADD0">
with his &s;word; and at the &s;ame mo|ment threw him with violence from the bed again&s;t the door; on which he roared out, that he was a dead man. By that time, a &s;econd fellow, who had got up to the window, was half in, when, calling to a third below, to ha&s;te up after him, mr. Grandi&s;on ran to the &s;econd fellow, who then fired a pi&s;tol, but happily mi&s;&s;ed him; and feeling the point of the &s;word in his arm, threw him&s;elf, with a little of mr. Grandi&s;on's help, upon the third ruffian, who was mounting the ladder, and knocked him off; after which both made their e&s;cape. Mean while the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in within had fainted away, and the two maids let in mr. Grandi|&s;on's and mr. Danby's &s;ervants, who had been alarmed by the &s;creams of the women from their window, and the report of the pi&s;tol. The two foot|men, having, by Mr. Grandi&s;on's order, bound up the ruffian's &s;houlder, and carried him into the hall, he came to him&s;elf and offered to make a full confe&s;&s;ion; and being carried before a magi&s;trate, laid open the whole vil|lainy.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="022852_0052_0FBA9D79B52AFE10">
Mr. Danby had a brother of very abandoned principles, to whom he had frequently given large &s;ums, which he had &s;quandered away in his debauche|ries. He had al&s;o &s;ettled a thou&s;and guineas on each of the children of his brother, who had the folly and impu|dence to make a demand of the &s;ame &s;um, pleading that he had as much right to it as they; and enraged at his meeting with a refu&s;al, formed a de|&s;ign to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his whole fortune. For, mr. Danby being a bache|lor, and being known to have an aver|&s;ion to the thoughts of making his will, this wretch had hired the&s;e ruffians to murder him; and that the fact might have the appearance of being done by robbers, the hou&s;e was to have been plundered, as &s;oon as the horrid fact was perpetrated. The villains were each to receive a thou&s;and crowns on this unnatural mon&s;ter's getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of his brother's fortune; and they had fifty crowns a-piece <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them in hand.

<P><PB N="54" REF="022852_0053_0FBA9D7CECFBD6B0">
During the time that mr. Grandi&s;on was &s;acrificing the deare&s;t wi&s;hes of his heart to his religion, and his love of his country, and was expo&s;ed to dan|gers that called forth all his courage, his father was indulging his love of plea&s;ure. He placed over his daughters as governe&s;s, the widow of one of his companions, named Oldham, who&s;e fortune had not held out as &s;ir Tho|mas's had done. This lady had fine qualities, was well de&s;cended, hand|&s;ome, and an economi&s;t: But &s;he &s;oon became &s;o unhappily &s;en&s;ible of &s;ir Thomas's favours and pre&s;ents, that in a little more than a twelve-month, &s;he was obliged to come up to town, where &s;he lay in. The elde&s;t of the young ladies being at that time about nineteen, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> younge&s;t &s;ixteen years old, they had &s;uch &s;pirit as to oppo&s;e this lady's return to her office; and undertook to manage every thing them&s;elves at their capital feat in Hamp&s;hire. But &s;ir Thomas having another &s;eat in E&s;&s;ex, carried mrs. Oldham thither; and for &s;ome time every body apprehended that they were married. Sir Thomas was highly di&s;|plea&s;ed
<PB N="55" REF="022852_0054_0FBA9D7E1DE90F08">
at his daughters for oppo&s;ing the return of their governe&s;s. And he had another mi&s;tre&s;s in town, who had a ta&s;te for all its gaieties.</P>
<P>The young ladies were now treated with great &s;everity by &s;ir Thomas: and his &s;on had not been long abroad, when they were forbid to corre&s;pond with him, le&s;t his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">llies &s;hould be the &s;ubject of their corre&s;pondence: and he al&s;o ordered their brother not to write to them. This prohibition gave the&s;e ladies the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible concern, as they dreaded its laying a foundation for their being treated with indiffer|ence by their brother, on whom, as their mother had foretold, they were likely, if he &s;urvived their father, to have too great a dependence. But though &s;ir Thomas &s;hewed not the lea&s;t tenderne&s;s for his daughters, he, in all companies gloried in his &s;on, who he ob&s;erved, was all that was dutiful, brave, worthy and pious; alleging to his intimate friends, that the rea&s;on of his permitting his being &s;o long ab&s;ent, was, that his &s;on's morals and his own were &s;o different, that he &s;hould be a&s;hamed of his &s;uperiority; but, that
<PB N="56" REF="022852_0055_0FBA9D7FD4527038">
he intended to alter his cour&s;e of life, and then he would &s;end for him. In the mean while, mrs. Farnboro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gh, the woman he lived with, when in town, being &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox, died; on which &s;ir Thomas was &s;o much affected, that he left the town; and in pur&s;uance of his temporary good re&s;olutions, lived with his daugh|ters, and talked of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ending for his &s;on; and for &s;ome months behaved like a man of &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>About the time of mrs. Farnbo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ough's being taken ill, Lord L&mdash;returning from his travels, brought &s;ir Thomas &s;ome pre&s;ents from his &s;on, who took all opportunities to &s;end him curio&s;ities, &s;ome of which were of confiderable value, and &s;erved to &s;hew both his duty and economy. Sir Tho|mas appeared fond of lord L. and on his retiring to Grandi&s;on Hall, after mrs. Farnborough's death, gave him an invitation to vi&s;it him there. Hence that nobleman attended him at the hall, where he fell in love with the elde&s;t of the young ladies, to whom he revealed his pa&s;&s;ion. She referred her|&s;elf wholly to her father: but though
<PB N="57" REF="022852_0056_0FBA9D8112AD0950">
this match would have been highly to her advantage, &s;ir Thomas ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>At length, &s;ir Thomas re&s;olved to regulate his affairs, preparatory to the leave he intended to give his &s;on to re|turn home. But he knew not what to do with mrs. Oldham, and two chil|dren he had by her. He made no doubt of his &s;on's having heard of his guilty commerce with her: but he did not choo&s;e that he &s;hould find her living with him as a mi&s;tre&s;s, in one of the family &s;eats. He was al&s;o unwilling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o u&s;e her unhand&s;omely, and thought him&s;elf obliged to provide for the children he had by her.</P>
<P>While he was thus contriving how to make the be&s;t appearance before his &s;on, who&s;e character for virtue and prudence, made him half afraid of him, he received a propo&s;al of marriage for the young gentleman from one of the fir&s;t men in the king|dom, who&s;e daughter accompanying her brother and his lady in a tour to France and Italy, fell in love with mr. Grandi&s;on at Florence. Sir Thomas had &s;everal meetings on this &s;ubject,
<PB N="58" REF="022852_0057_0FBA9D82A5459870">
both with the brother and the earl, his father, and was &s;o fond of bring|ing it to bear, that he had thoughts of re&s;erving to him&s;elf an annuity, and, in favour of this match, making over the whole e&s;tate to his &s;on; and actually &s;ent him this propo&s;al. But mr. Grandi&s;on in his an&s;wer, ob&s;erv|ed, that if this aro&s;e from his genero|&s;ity, affection, and indulgence, he had &s;o often experienced, he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear it; but if it proceeded from pro|po&s;als made to him, God forbid; &s;aid he, that I &s;hould give your name to a woman, however illustrious in her de&s;cent, and however wealthy, who&s;e friends could offer &s;uch conditions to my father. On this an&s;wer, &s;ir Tho|mas re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend the treaty of marriage till his &s;on's arrival.</P>
<P>While &s;ir Thomas was planning fu|ture &s;chemes of life, and had actual|ly begun to treat with mrs.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sir Charles returns to England. His engaging behaviour to his &s;i&s;ters, and to mrs. Oldham.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE affairs of the family were in this &s;ituation when Sir Charles arrived. He returned no an&s;wer to his &s;i&s;ter's letters, but in&s;tantly &s;et out for Calais, embarked, and the &s;ame day in which he landed, arrived at his late father's hou&s;e in St. James's &s;quare. How awful to the &s;i&s;ters, after an ab&s;ence of eight or nine years, mu&s;t be the fir&s;t appearance of a bro|ther, on whom their fortunes entirely depended, and to whom they had been accu&s;ed by their father, now &s;o lately departed, of want of duty! He alighted from his po&s;t-chai&s;e at the door, and his two &s;i&s;ters met him in the hall. They remembered the grace|ful youth of &s;eventeen, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad left them, with his fine curling auburn locks waving on his &s;houlders, intel|ligence &s;parkling in his fine eyes, and his lively features &s;weetened by good humour; and, forgetting the woman|ly

beauties into which their own fea|tures were ripened, &s;eemed not to ex|pect that manly &s;tature and air, and that equal vivacity and intrepidity, with a noble countenance, that then appeared more than u&s;ually &s;olemn, from his having in his thoughts an unburied and beloved father. O my brother! &s;aid Caroline, meeting him with open arms, but &s;hrinking from his embrace, may I &s;ay my brother? and was ju&s;t fainting. He cla&s;ped her, and &s;upported her in his arms, Char|lotte, the younge&s;t, affected at his pre|fence, and &s;urprized at her &s;i&s;ter's emo|tion, ran back into the room they had left, and threw her&s;elf upon a &s;ettee. Her brother followed her, &s;oothing mi&s;s Caroline, with his arm round her wai&s;t, and with eyes of expecta|tion, cried, my Charlotte! holding out his inviting hand, and ha&s;ting to|wards the &s;ettee. She then found her feet, and throwing her arms about his neck, he folded both of his &s;i&s;ters to his bo&s;om, crying, receive, my dear|e&s;t &s;i&s;ters, receive your brother, your friend. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elves of my un|abated love. That a&s;&s;urance, they
<PB N="62" REF="022852_0061_0FBA9D8A153BCA80">
cried, was balm to their hearts; and when each was &s;eated, he &s;itting over again&s;t them, looked fir&s;t at one, then on the other; and taking each by the hand, charming women! &s;aid he, how I admire my &s;i&s;ters! I don't doubt, that you have minds an&s;werable to your per&s;ons. What plea&s;ure, what pride &s;hall I take in my &s;i&s;ters! My dear Charlotte! &s;aid mi&s;s Caro|line, taking her &s;i&s;ter's other hand, has not our brother all the brother in his face? His goodne&s;s only looks &s;tronger and more perfect. What was I afraid of? My heart al&s;o &s;unk; I knew not why, &s;aid Charlotte. But we feared&mdash;indeed, &s;ir, we both fear|ed&mdash;O my brother! tears trickling down the cheeks of each&mdash;We did not mean to be undutiful&mdash;Love your brother, my dear &s;i&s;ters, he re|turned, as he will endeavour to de|&s;erve your love: my mother's daugh|ters could not be undutiful&mdash;mi&s;take only!&mdash;unhappy mi&s;apprehen&s;ion! He then pre&s;&s;ed the hands of each with his lips, aro&s;e, went to the win|dow, and wiped his eyes&mdash;Then turning towards them, added, permit

me, my dear &s;i&s;ters, to retire for a moment, my father demands this tri|bute. They waited on him to his a|partment with &s;ilent re&s;pect. No cere|mony, I hope, my Caroline, my Char|lotte, he re&s;umed, we were true &s;i&s;ters and brother a few years ago: &s;ee your Charles as you &s;aw him then; and don't let ab&s;ence, which has increa&s;ed my love, le&s;&s;en yours. Each &s;i&s;ter then took a hand, and would have ki&s;&s;ed it. But he cla&s;ped his arms about them both, and &s;aluted them. He ca&s;t his eyes on his father's and mo|ther's pictures, with &s;ome emotion; then on them, and again &s;aluting each of them, they withdrew with tears of joy trickling down their cheeks.</P>
<P>Sir Charles in half an hour rejoin|ed them in another dre&s;s, and again &s;aluted them with an air of tenderne&s;s that bani&s;hed fear, and left room for nothing but love. Soon after their cou&s;in Grandi&s;on came in: and after the fir&s;t compliments, the ladies retir|ing, that gentleman touched upon the circum&s;tances of &s;ir Thomas's illne&s;s, and death; inveighing again&s;t mrs. Oldham, telling &s;ir Charles what they
<PB N="64" REF="022852_0063_0FBA9D8E52D15A30">
had done, and exclaiming again&s;t her for the &s;tate &s;he had lived in, and her unwillingne&s;s to re&s;ign the care of &s;ir Thomas, in his illne&s;s, to his daugh|ters. He then a&s;ked &s;ir Charles, if he was not plea&s;ed with what they had done as to that vile woman? But he only ob&s;erved, that he believed every thing was de&s;igned for the be&s;t. Mr. Grandi&s;on then ridiculed her grief and mortification at being obliged to leave the hou&s;e, where &s;he had &s;o long reigned lady paramount. Sir Charles a&s;ked, if they had found a will? And was an&s;wered, that they looked in every probable place&punc; but found none. I intend, &s;aid &s;ir Charles, to inter the venerable remains with tho&s;e of my mother, which I know was his de&s;ire. An elegant, but not &s;umptuous monu|ment &s;hall be erected to the memory of both, with a mode&s;t in&s;cription, that &s;hall be rather a matter of in&s;truc|tion to the living than a panegyric on the decea&s;ed. The funeral &s;hall be decent, but not o&s;tentatious: and the difference of the expence &s;hall be pri|vately applied to a&s;&s;i&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed hou&s;e|keepers, or &s;ome of my father's poor

tenants, who have large families, and have endeavoured, by their indu&s;try, to maintain them. And this was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">n after carried into execution.</P>
<P>The &s;olemnity was no &s;ooner over, than &s;ir Charles, leaving every thing as he found it, at Grandi&s;on-hall, came to town, and in the pre&s;ence of his &s;i&s;ters, broke the &s;eals they had affixed to the cabinets and e&s;crutores in the hou&s;e there; and having made memorandums of the contents of many papers, went with his &s;i&s;ters to the hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex, and when there, told them it was nece&s;&s;ary for Mrs. Old|ham, who had lodgings at a farm|hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, to be pre&s;ent at breaking the &s;eals, as &s;he had affixed her's; and accordingly &s;ent for her. She came with fear and trembling, when &s;ir Charles, not ex|pecting her &s;o &s;oon, was in his &s;table, with the groom and coachman, look|ing at his hor&s;es, which were &s;ome of the fine&s;t hunters and racers in Eng|land. She was &s;hown, by mi&s;take, into the room where the two ladies were; and at &s;eeing them was in great confu&s;ion, wept, curte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ied; and, on mi&s;s

<P>Two or three months after &s;ir Charles's arrival in England, lord L. came to town from Scotland, and paid him his fir&s;t vi&s;it; when, his lord&s;hip mentioning his love for mi&s;s Caroline, and &s;he acknowledging her regard for him, he introduced him to her, and joining their hands, held them be|tween both his; &s;aying, with plea&s;ure do I join hands, where &s;uch worthy hearts are united.

He then &s;aluted her, and withdrew before &s;he broke the &s;eal; and when &s;he did, &s;he found it con|tained bank notes for 10,000l.

<P>They &s;tayed till about two in the morning, when mr.

gentleman referred them to their bro|ther; on which they took the fir&s;t op|portunity to a&s;k him whether he had any thought of marriage, and if his heart was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any foreign lady. To this he only an&s;wered, that he was in a very difficult &s;ituation, and far from being happy. But a few days after, taking mi&s;s Byron in|to lord L&mdash;'s &s;tudy, he gave her the hi&s;tory of the noble Clementina and his friend Jeronymo, referring her, for farther particulars to his letters to dr. Bartlett. She was extremely mov|ed by the affecting &s;tory, admired and pitied the lovely Italian; and every hope of happine&s;s by an union with him, being now vani&s;hed, re&s;olved to u&s;e her utmo&s;t endeavours, to con|quer her pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, &s;ome days after, paid a vi&s;it to mi&s;s Byron at her uncle Reeve's, where being left alone with her, he, with a &s;olemn air, thus addre&s;&s;|ed her: The la&s;t time I had the ho|nour of being alone with my good mi&s;s Byron, I told her a very tender tale, which mu&s;t rai&s;e in &s;uch a heart as her's a generous compa&s;&s;ion for the

noble&s;t lady on the continent. The &s;tory did indeed, affect you; and I am &s;ure you mu&s;t have &s;uffered &s;till more from the &s;ame compa&s;&s;ionate goodne&s;s on the communications made you by dr. Bartlett. May I be al|lowed, madam, to add a few particu|lars on the &s;ame &s;ubject, for I am de&s;irous to acquaint you, rather than any woman in the world, with all I know my&s;elf of this melancholy af|fair. Mi&s;s Byron, with trembling he&s;itation, an&s;wered, that the &s;tory was, indeed, a mo&s;t affecting one, and that he would do her an honour in acquainting her with further particu|lars. Sir Charles then told her, that Clementina's brother the bi&s;hop, had written to entreat that he would once more vi&s;it Bologna, though the gene|ral was again&s;t his coming. He of|fered to meet him where he plea&s;ed, and to conduct him to Bologna, where his pre&s;ence would rejoice every heart. He likewi&s;e &s;hewed her a letter from mrs. Beaumont, which informed him of many affecting particulars. The noble yet unhappy Clementina had been hurried from place to place, with

the expectation of &s;eeing him, and had afterwards been put into the hands of the lady Sforza, and her daughter Laurana, who, from intere&s;ted mo|tives, and envy of her &s;uperior quali|ties, had treated her with the utmo&s;t cruelty. Mi&s;s Byron wept at read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the affecting particulars of tho&s;e in|humanities, which had broken the &s;pi|rit of the excellent lady, while &s;ir Charles cried ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, how in&s;upportable have been my reflex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, did my con|&s;cience tell me that I had been the wilful cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the noble Clementina's calamities! He al&s;o &s;hewed her a let|ter from &s;eignior Jeronymo, which informed me that his life was a bur|den to him, and that he did not think him&s;elf in &s;kilful hands, wi&s;hing that &s;ir Charles and him&s;elf had been of one country, &s;ince the greate&s;t felici|ty he could now enjoy, would be to re&s;ign up his life to the great author of it, in the arms of his deare&s;t friend.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant mr. Reeves entering the room, mi&s;s Byron walked to the window, and &s;trove to recollect her|&s;elf. The gentleman &s;oon after with|drew, when &s;ir Charles coming up to

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sir Charles re&s;cues &s;ir Hargrave Pol|lexfen from the farther re&s;entment of the per&s;ons whom he had injur|ed.

The di&s;tre&s;s|ful &s;cenes which followed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN his journey to Paris, he was &s;topped by one of &s;ir Hargrave Pol|lexfen's &s;ervants, who gave him a di&s;mal account that his ma&s;ter and another gentleman had been at|tacked by &s;everal men, who were at that time murdering them behind a hill at a &s;mall di&s;tance. Sir Charles leaping out of the po&s;tchai&s;e, de&s;ired mr. Lowther's &s;ervant to di&s;mount, and getting on his hor&s;e, galloped away with his three &s;ervants towards the place. His ears were &s;oon pierced with the poor wretches cries, and he beheld two men on hor&s;eback hold|ing
<PB N="110" REF="022852_0109_0FBA9B7F23FEEF70">
the hor&s;es of four others, who had two gentlemen under them &s;trug|gling, groaning, and crying for mercy. Sir Charles who was a good way a|head of his &s;ervants, called to them to &s;pare the gentlemen, and galloping towards the pro&s;trate &s;ufferers, two of the four quitted them, and mounting, joined the two other hor&s;emen, ad|vancing to meet him, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h a &s;hew of &s;upporting the two men on foot, who continued lying on the wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> un|mercifully with the bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t end of their whip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. The four men on hor&s;e-back demanded a conference, with their pi&s;tols in their hands, as &s;ir Charles al&s;o had his, advi&s;ing him not to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|voke his fate by his ra&s;hne&s;s, and de|claring that he was a dead man if he fired. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r Charles bid them forbear all further violence to the gentlemen, and then he would hear what they had to &s;ay. He then put his pi&s;tol into his hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er, and one of his &s;ervants coming up, and the two others being at hand, he called out to them not to fire till they had his orders; and giv|ing him hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hor&s;e's reins, leaped down, drew his &s;word, and advancing to|wards

the two men who were &s;o cruel|ly exerci&s;ing their whips: but on his approach, they drew their hang|ers, and retired to a little di&s;tance. The four men on hor&s;e-back joining the two on foot, ju&s;t as they were quitting the object of their fury, one of them &s;aid, forbear brother, for the pre&s;ent, any farther violence; the gentleman &s;hall be told the cau&s;e. Murder, &s;ir, &s;aid he, is not intended, nor are we robbers. Tho&s;e you are &s;olicitous to &s;ave are villains. At this in&s;tant, &s;ir Charles fir&s;t rai&s;ed one groaning man, and then the other. Their heads were covered with blood, and they were &s;o brui&s;ed, that they could not extend their arms to reach their wigs and hats which lay near them. By this time the men on foot had mounted their hor&s;es, and all &s;ix &s;tood on their defence; but one of them was &s;o furious, that two of the others could &s;carce re&s;train him, he cried that his vengeance &s;hould be &s;till more complete. At this in&s;tant came up mr. Lowther, and his &s;ervant in the chai&s;e, each with a pi&s;tol in his hand, and he having, at &s;ir Charles's
<PB N="112" REF="022852_0111_0FBA9B81EFC15B68">
de&s;ire, examined their wounds, de|clared that there was no apparent dan|ger of death. On which &s;ir Charles ob&s;erved, that as they had neither at|tempted to fly, nor been guilty of vio|lence to him&s;elf, his friend, or &s;er|vants, he was afraid they had rea&s;on to think them&s;elves ill u&s;ed by the gentlemen. You, &s;ir, cried one of them, &s;eem to be a man of honour and temper; we are men of honour as well as you. Our de&s;ign was not to kill the mi&s;creants, as we told you, but to give them rea&s;on to remember their villainy as long as they lived, and to put it out of their power ever to be guilty of the like. They have made a vile attempt on a lady's honour at Abbeville, and finding them&s;elves de|tected, have endeavoured, by round|about ways, to e&s;cape the vengeance of her friends. That gentleman has rea&s;on for being enraged, &s;ince he is the lady's hu&s;band; that and that are her brothers. The villains have not yet been puni&s;hed as they de&s;erve, but let them a&s;k on their knees this gen|tleman's pardon, pointing to the hu&s;|band, and promi&s;e never more to come

within two leagues of Abbeville, and we will leave them in your protection. Sir Charles then turning towards &s;ir Hargrave and his companion, &s;aid, gentlemen, if you have done wrong, you ought not &s;cruple a&s;king pardon; but if you know your&s;elves to be in|nocent, though I would be loth to ri&s;que the lives of my friend and &s;er|vants; my countrymen &s;hall not make &s;o undue a &s;ubmi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ion. The wretches in&s;tantly kneeled, and the others ci|villy &s;aluting &s;ir Charles and mr. Lowther, rode off to the great joy of the two delinquents, who again kneel|ed to their deliverers, pouring forth ble&s;&s;ings on the man who&s;e life one of them had &s;o lately &s;ought, and in who&s;e pre&s;ervation he had &s;uch rea|&s;on to rejoice. Sir Hargrave's po&s;t|chai&s;e now coming up, he and his companion were, with difficulty, lift|ed into it, while &s;ir Charles and Mr. Lowther went into theirs, and being only at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Paris, they proceeded to that city in company.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was met at Parma by the bi&s;hop and father Mare&s;cotti, where he found them at the palace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="114" REF="022852_0113_0FBA9B8731E3E190">
the count of Belvedere. They all expre&s;&s;ed great joy at &s;eeing him; but told him, on his enquiring after the barone Jeronymo, that he was alive, and that was all; however, the &s;ight of his friend would be a cor|dial to his heart. As to Clementina, her bodily health was greatly impair|ed, and they had little hopes of the recovery of her mind. They both re|gretted that &s;he had been denied the reque&s;ted interview at his departure, and were convinced, that if it had been granted, and &s;he had been left to mrs. Beaumont's friendly care, they might have expected a happy i&s;&s;ue. The next day they &s;et out for Bolog|na, and the count of Belvedere ac|companying them about half way, found an opportunity to mention to &s;ir Charles his unabated pa&s;&s;ion for Clementina, and that he had lately made offers to marry her, notwith|&s;tanding the di&s;order of her mind, &s;ince he flattered him&s;elf that her cure was not impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, on his arrival at Bo|logna, ha&s;ted to the barone, who, the moment he &s;aw him, cried, do I once

The bi&s;hop then led him to the marqui&s;s and marchio|ne&s;s, when his reception from the former was kind, but from that of his lady, it was that of a mother to a long ab&s;ent child. She told him, &s;he had had ever e&s;teemed him her fourth &s;on, and now he had brought over with him a &s;urgeon of experience, and advice in writing, of eminent phy&s;i|cians of his country, the obligations he had laid on their whole family, were too great ever to be returned.

<P>When &s;ir Charles had been a few days at Bologna, the lady Clemen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ina was brought thither by the ge|neral and his lady, to whom he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ately been married.

pre&s;ent. Being before told that he was arrived, &s;he entered, leaving only Camilla, her woman, with her &s;er|vant Laura attending. Her motion was &s;low and &s;olemn; her robes were black, and flowing; her dejected face was half covered by a veil of black gau&s;e, and her eyes ca&s;t on the ground. Sir Charles aro&s;e from his &s;eat, &s;at down, and ro&s;e again irre&s;olute, not knowing what he did, or what to do. She approached the table, round which the company &s;at, but with her eyes ca&s;t down, and more than half clo&s;|ed: &s;he then turned towards the window.

Her mother wept, as did al&s;o the general's lady; and her father &s;obbing, turned his head a&s;ide. Her mother then took her hand, &s;ay|ing, my love, look round about you; but &s;he took no notice.

and every body in tears. If you love us, &s;mile upon us; when lifting up her eyes to him, &s;he tried to &s;mile: but &s;uch a &s;olemnity had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her features, that her &s;mile ap|peared the &s;mile of woe. The mar|quis ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, with his handkerchief at his eyes, cried, &s;weet creature! never, never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et me &s;ee a|gain &s;uch &s;mile as that.

She ro&s;e, then threw her arms about Ca|milla, who &s;tood by her, crying, O Camilla! then gave way to a violent bur&s;t of tears.

good Camilla! now at la&s;t you have told me truth! It is, it is he, hiding her face in Camilla's bo&s;om. She then, &s;upported by the Marchio|ne&s;s and the general's lady, turned to|wards the door; but &s;ir Charles com|ing up to her, &s;he &s;topped, and &s;aying, Ah, chevalier, reclined her head on her mother's bo&s;om, &s;eemed ready to faint.

She moved on to the door, and then turned her head, &s;training to look at him till &s;he was out of the room, &s;ir Charles &s;tanding like a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>After this, many tender interviews pa&s;&s;ed between &s;ir Charles and Cle|mentina. The whole family repeat|edly u&s;ed the mo&s;t earne&s;t per&s;ua&s;ions to induce &s;ir Charles to change his religion; but the&s;e proving ineffec|tual, they con&s;ented to give him Cle|mentina on the conditions he him&s;elf had propo&s;ed; the daughters were, therefore, to be con&s;idered as Italians,
<PB N="120" REF="022852_0119_0FBA9B94C7A65FC0">
they were to be educated in Italy, and to enjoy the great e&s;tate given to Cle|mentina by her two grandfathers, on condition of her marrying; while the &s;ons, as being prote&s;&s;ants, were to be educated in England, and provided for by their father. Mean while, &s;ir Charles's joy was damped by the grief of the count of Belvedere, who, ar|riving at Bologna, pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d him &s;everal vi&s;its; and being weary of life, &s;trove, but in vain to prevail on &s;ir Charles to meet him without the city gates, prote&s;ting, that while he had life, Clementina &s;hould not be his.</P>
<P>The whole family having con&s;ented to &s;ir Charles's union with Clemen|tina, and the marriage articles being &s;ettled, it was imagined &s;he would have received his hand with tran&s;port: but now a &s;udden thoughtfulne&s;s took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, and &s;he &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in writing. On &s;ir Charles'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> being introduced to her, &s;he received him with tears, &s;ighs, and trembling he&s;itation; and having put a paper into his hand, cried, leave me, leave me; then retiring to her clo&s;et, &s;hut the door, and fell on her knees;

when &s;ir Charles, to avoid hearing &s;ighs which pierced his heart, walked into the next room, where he found her mother and Camilla, who in&s;tant|ly went to her.

<P>At reading this paper, &s;ir Charles was amazed, confounded, and filled with admiration at the angelic &s;oul of this lady.

The admirable lady met him half way, and throwing her&s;elf at his feet, &s;aid, forgive, forgive the creature that mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, if &s;he has offended you. He attempted to rai&s;e her, but &s;he cried, &s;he would not ri&s;e till he had forgiven her. He then kneeled to her as &s;he kneeled, and cla&s;ping her in his arms, cried, forgive you, ma|dam!

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron &s;truggles to conquer her pa&s;&s;ion; but &s;ir Charles no &s;ooner returns to England, than he pays his addre&s;&s;es to her. Their court|&s;hip and marriage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON &s;ir Charles's arrival in his na|tive country, he was received by his family and friends with the warm|e&s;t te&s;timonies of joy: but he was ex|tremely alarmed to hear that mi&s;s By|ron was ill; he therefore took a jour|ney into Northamp on&s;hire, where that lady lived with her relations, and paid a vi&s;it to Mrs. Shirley, her grand|mother, an elderly lady of a very amiable character; when, informing her of his &s;ituation with re&s;pect to Clementina, he a&s;ked if it was con|&s;i&s;tent with her notions of delicacy, to
<PB N="135" REF="022852_0134_0FBA9BAF523550E0">
give her intere&s;t in his favour; ad|ding, that if it was, and if mi&s;s Byron would accept of a heart that had been thus unaccountably divided, they would lay him under an obligation that he could only endeavour to re|turn by the utmo&s;t gratitude and af|fection; then de&s;iring an an&s;wer in writing, he left upon the table &s;everal letters he had received from Jerony|mo and Clementina, with his an&s;wers, that &s;he might &s;ee that the affair was entirely fini&s;hed between him and that lady, and then took his leave.</P>
<P>Immediately mrs. Shirley &s;ent for mi&s;s Byron, mr. and mrs. Selby, with &s;ome other relations, and having informed them of the welcome news, they read the letters, which gave them entire &s;atisfaction; on which the old lady wrote to &s;ir Charles, that they received as the highe&s;t honour, the offer he had made of an alliance, that would do credit to families of the fir&s;t rank; and that it had been their mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h, that the man, who had re&s;cued the dear creature, might be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> liberty to entitle him&s;elf to her grate|ful love.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="022852_0135_0FBA9BB124FB9720">
Sir Charles, on receiving this wel|come letter, paid his addre&s;&s;es to mi&s;s Byron. She at fir&s;t received him with vi&s;ible confu&s;ion, but was &s;oon en|couraged by his polite and tender be|haviour. He &s;howed her another let|ter from Jeronymo, in which his dear friend urged him to &s;et an example to Clementina, by entering into the mar|riage &s;tate, and informing him, that the noble lady wi&s;hed for nothing more than to hear of his being happily married. You &s;ee, madam, added he, I am fully free, with regard to Cle|mentina; free by her own choice. It was always Clementina's wi&s;h that I would marry, and only be careful that my choice &s;hould not di&s;grace her regard for me; but when &s;he has the plea&s;ure of knowing the dear lady be|fore me, if I am allowed that honour, &s;he will confe&s;s that my choice has done the highe&s;t credit to the favour &s;he honoured me with.

What does my dear mi&s;s Byron own? What confe&s;s? &s;aid he. A&s;|&s;ure your&s;elf, madam, of my honour, of my gratitude. Should you have doubts, &s;peak them.

Byron, returned he, in a rapture; and is this all your fear? Then mu&s;t the man before you be happy.

How was &s;ir Charles ble&s;&s;ed by the poor, and people of low circum|&s;tances, for his well di&s;po&s;ed bounty!</P>
<P>Sir Charles and his bride, having received and returned the vi&s;its of the neighbouring gentry, and giving the tenants their company at another en|tertainment provided for them, they &s;et out for Grandi&s;on-hall, &s;ir Charles's principal &s;eat; where, hav|ing again run the round of receiv|ing and paying vi&s;its, they &s;ettled into that plea&s;ing &s;erenity, that con&s;titutes the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of human hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable part of his time was now employed in improving his e&s;|tate, in order to enable him to exer|ci&s;e his generous &s;pirit. He became acquainted with every tenant, and even cottager, enquiring into their circum&s;tances, the number of their children, and their pro&s;pects. When they were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he would forgive arrears of rent; or &s;end them on ur|gent

At the tenants' de&s;ire, he tran&s;plant|ed one to a larger farm, and another to a le&s;s, according to their &s;tock, or the probability of &s;ucce&s;s.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Clementina, who had e&s;caped from her friend, comes to England to avoid marrying the count of Bel|vedere,
<PB N="146" REF="022852_0145_0FBA9BCBD2935F00">

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE &s;ir Charles was thus employed in the mo&s;t generous acts of humanity and friend&s;hip, a letter he received from the barone della Porretta, filled him with deep concern. By this letter he learned that the lady Clementina, being &s;trongly bent on taking the veil, had been pre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s and ince&s;&s;ant importunity to give her hand to the count of Belvedere, as had greatly di&s;ordered her brain; and that, to avoid that union, and put a &s;top to the&s;e importunate &s;olicitations, &s;he had fled from her friends; and with no other attendants than her page, an Engli&s;h youth, and her &s;ervant Lau|ra, had embarked in a ve&s;&s;el bound to London; and that both her father, mother, and him&s;elf, together with &s;everal other of her friends, being in|con&s;olable for her lo&s;s, were follow|ing her; be&s;eeching him to &s;earch for the fugitive Clementina, and to pro|vide
<PB N="147" REF="022852_0146_0FBA9BCDA379E4D8">
them lodgings again&s;t their arri|val. It is no wonder that this news gave both &s;ir Charles and his lady great concern. They were then at Grandi&s;on-hall: and that lady being firmly convinced of the &s;teadine&s;s of his v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rtue, immediately per&s;uaded him to give the unhappy Clementina his protection. Dear &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, con&s;ider me as a &s;trengthener&punc; not as a weakener of your hands in her &s;er|vice. My only concern is for her &s;afety and honour, and for your con|cern on the affecting occa&s;ion, and let me, by &s;ympathi&s;ing with you, le&s;|&s;en it. Soul of my &s;oul, cried he, cla&s;ping her in his bo&s;om, I have not the lea&s;t doubt of your generous goodne&s;s. It would be doing inju&s;tice to the unhappy lady, and to the know|ledge I have of my own heart, as well as to you, the ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of it, to think it nece&s;&s;ary to make profe&s;&s;ions of my inviolable love to you. I will acquaint you with every &s;tep I take on this occa&s;ion, and mu&s;t have your advice as I go along: for &s;uch delicate m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nds as yours and Cle|mentina's mu&s;t be nearly allied.</P>

Sir Charles immediately rode po&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o town, where he found a long let|ter from the fugitive lady, who in unconnected ramblings, lamented the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ep &s;he had taken; ob&s;erving, that &s;he was far from being happy; but wi&s;hed for his advice and protection, though &s;he did not dare to let him know where he might &s;ee her; yet at the &s;ame time informed him how he might direct a letter, &s;o as to come to her hands. He &s;trove, in his an&s;wer, to &s;ooth her mind; offering to put her under his lady's or his &s;i&s;ter's pro|tection; and be&s;eeching her to re|move his anxiety, by giving him an immediate opportunity of &s;eeing her. In another letter &s;he earne&s;tly endea|voured to engage him to u&s;e his inte|re&s;t with her friends to allow her the freedom of her choice, and prevent her being forced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o marry the count of Belvedere. All this he readily promi&s;ed in his reply. And &s;he al|lowed him to wait on her.</P>
<P>Sir Charles went, and was intro|duced by her &s;ervant Laura. On his entering the room, he immediately welcomed her to England. Do you,

<P>Sir Charles conducted the family, by ea&s;y journ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es, to London, where he brought them to the hou&s;e he had provided for their reception; and was agreeably &s;urprized, on their arrival, at finding that his lady had, unknown to him, prepared an elegant repa&s;t.

Clementina; in which he propo&s;ed, that &s;he &s;hould lay a&s;ide all thoughts of retiring to a convent, be allowed to choo&s;e her way of life, and her at|tendants: that her parents and bro|thers &s;hould promi&s;e never to per|&s;uade her, much le&s;s to compel her to marry any man; and that the count of Belvedere &s;hould di&s;continue his ad|dre&s;&s;es. After &s;ome debate, the whole family con&s;ented to the&s;e articles: but the lady Clementina found the greate&s;t difficulty in giving up her fa|vourite project of taking the veil; nor could the count of Belvedere, without the greate&s;t agony of mind, &s;ubmit to di&s;continue his preten&s;ions.

the a&s;&s;urance I de&s;ire. They embra|ced her; then tenderly rai&s;ing her, embraced her again.</P>
<P>This noble lady was not informed till the day before, that the count of Belvedere had accompanied her friends to England. Sir Charles made u&s;e of great precaution in telling her; and at the &s;ame time let her know, that the count was very de&s;irous of taking his leave of her. She con&s;ent|ed to &s;ee him, as one of the friends of her father and brothers, and in that light deferred his departure; &s;he had afterwards &s;everal conver&s;ations with him, and, before all her relations, behaved towards him with the re&s;pect due to his merit. She was &s;en&s;ible of the ardour with which her parents and brothers wi&s;hed to &s;ee her married to that accompli&s;hed nobleman. She could not help ob&s;erving the plea&s;ure that &s;parkled in his eyes, whenever &s;he was plea&s;ed to enter into di&s;cour&s;e with him; and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idering their motives, with the extraordinary merit of the count, together with the rea&s;ons that had induced her to re|&s;olve never to enter into the marriage

&s;tate, &s;he at length began to he&s;itate, and voluntarily promi&s;ed her relations that if, within a year's time, &s;he &s;hould find no rea&s;on to change her mind, &s;he would chearfully comply with their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this noble family &s;taid &s;e|veral months with &s;ir Charles. Every opportunity was taken to render their re&s;idence in England as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible, and on their taking their leave, &s;ir Charles and his lady attend|ed them to Dover.</P>
<P>The next year, &s;ir Charles and his lady went to Italy, where they were received by this noble family with tran&s;ports of joy. They found Cle|mentina perfectly free from her un|happy di&s;order of mind. After having &s;pent &s;everal months in Italy, &s;ir Charles and his lady, in company with his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, return|ed to England, where they had the plea&s;ure to re&s;ume their former plan of life. Their piety and virtue are the &s;ources of the noble&s;t plea&s;ures that can fill the human mind.</P>
