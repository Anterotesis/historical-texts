<P>WITH a heart deeply impre&s;&s;ed, with a &s;erious belief in the divine originality of the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation: Awed, as in the pre&s;ence of the dread Sovereign of the univer&s;e: to who&s;e penetrating eye the &s;ecrets of all hearts are di&s;clo&s;ed: And &s;en&s;ibly affected, by the &s;olemnity of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion: I &s;hall addre&s;s you, my chri&s;tian friends, in the un|daunted, though truly pathetic language of the great Apo&s;tle Paul to the Ephe&s;ians.</P>
<Q><P>But none of the&s;e things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God.</P>
<P>And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, &s;hall &s;ee my face no more.</P>
<P>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</P>
<P>For I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God.</P>
<P>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified.</P></Q>

IF any con&s;iderations were &s;ufficient to control the angry pa&s;&s;ions and blind prejudices of man|kind; to &s;ubdue the enmity of the human heart; to calm the raging tumults of the troubled brea&s;t; and cau&s;e the wrath of man to give place to the tender feelings, and kind affections of friend&s;hip and brotherly love: &s;urely they mu&s;t be tho&s;e, which are &s;ugge&s;ted by that pure and holy reli|gion, which originated in the infinite wi&s;dom, and boundle&s;s goodne&s;s of the Almighty.&mdash;Which was publi&s;hed to a fallen world, by Jehovah's fir&s;t-born; recommended to human ob&s;ervation in his own perfect example: Which is &s;till urged upon mankind by the life and conver&s;ation of every faithful di&s;clple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; And by the powerful, though &s;ilent pleadings of the holy Spirit; And which has for its only objects, the glory of the ever ble&s;&s;ed God, and the felicity of his intelligent offspring.</P>
<P>It is the de&s;ign of chri&s;tianity, to make men benevolent and good here; that they may be happy and glorious hereafter. To accompli&s;h this all-gracious de&s;ign, the Son of God, for a time, for&s;ook his Father's bo&s;om; and de&s;cended from his throne, in the highe&s;t heavens, to the humiliating &s;ituation of a man de&s;pi&s;ed upon earth. To every indignity, that the blind malice of an abandoned world could invent, he willingly &s;ub|mitted. Knowing that to teach and in&s;truct man|kind by his example and doctrines; and by his &s;ufferings and death to redeem and &s;ave them;

were the great and important purpo&s;es to be gained by his mi&s;&s;ion; he patiently received the full vials of divine wrath, which were prepared for him.</P>
<P>With an uniform &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Father's will, and with a &s;ingle aim to the glory of the Godhead, in the &s;alvation of &s;inners; he &s;teadily pur&s;ued the thorny path, which led through every &s;pecies of &s;uffering and abu&s;e, from his manger to his cro&s;s. "He was de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men, he was indeed, a man of &s;orrow and acquainted with grief." Yet mark his deport|ment! "He was oppre&s;&s;ed and he was afflicted; yet he opened not his mouth. He was brought as a lamb to the &s;laughter, and as a &s;heep before her &s;hearers is dumb, &s;o he opened not his mouth. When he was reviled, he reviled not again. When he &s;uffered he threatened not; but com|mitted him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly." And when nailed to the accur&s;ed tree; amid&s;t the in&s;ults of an unfeeling multitude; as he bowed his &s;acred head in death, his &s;potle&s;s &s;oul a&s;cended to the throne of grace, with this &s;ervent &s;uppli|cation, for tho&s;e who &s;pilt his blood. <Q>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</Q></P>
<P>Such, my friends, was the Ma&s;ter whom the Apo&s;tle was miraculou&s;ly called to &s;erve. And &s;uch were the examples in patience and re&s;igna|tion, which were propo&s;ed for his imitation. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> mini&s;try which he had received of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> was to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>

This certainly is a &s;acred, and a mo&s;t important tru&s;t. Sufficient to exerci&s;e the di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, and to ju&s;tify the zeal of this truly great man, and faithful di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Next to his divine Ma&s;ter, perhaps no indivi|dual has ever done more, to promote the dignity and happine&s;s of human nature, than the Apo&s;tle Paul. And excepting Chri&s;t, perhaps no one ever met with more ungrateful returns for all his &s;er|vices and his &s;ufferings than he did. His hi&s;tory, commencing with his conver&s;ion to chri&s;tianity, is filled with a &s;eries of &s;urpri&s;ing exertions in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; And with affecting repre|&s;entations of the cruel and barbarous treatment he &s;uffered from tho&s;e, who&s;e eternal intere&s;t he endeavoured to promote, at the expen&s;e of every worldly con&s;ideration. He does him&s;elf the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that he is in nothing a whit behind the chiefe&s;t Apo&s;tles. <Q>Are they mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t (&s;aid he) I am more: in labours more abundant, in &s;tripes above mea&s;ure, in pri&s;ons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty &s;tripes &s;ave one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I &s;toned, thrice I &s;uffered &s;hipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep: In journeying often, in perils of waters; in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderne&s;s, in perils in the &s;ea, in perils among&s;t fal&s;e brethren. In wearine&s;s and pain|fulne&s;s,
<PB N="9" REF="025565_0009_0FCDFDB8EAE4CA08">
in watchings often, in hunger and thir&s;t, in fa&s;tings often, in cold and nakedne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e were the rewards which an ungrateful world had to be&s;tow upon one of the brighte&s;t ornaments of human nature. Upon one of the mo&s;t faithful and de&s;erving of the &s;ons of men. The&s;e were the evidences which St. Paul pro|duced of his Apo&s;tle&s;hip. <Q>Therefore (&s;aid he) I take plea&s;ure infirmities, in reproaches, in di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in nece&s;&s;ities, in per&s;ecutions, in di|&s;tre&s;&s;es for Chri&s;t's &s;ake: for when I am weak, then am I &s;trong. And truly (added he) the &s;igns of an Apo&s;tle were wrought among you in all patience.</Q></P>
<P>Our context exhibits a truly intere&s;ting and an affecting &s;cene. Let us accompany, in our ima|ginations, this holy man, on his journey through various parts of A&s;ia, di&s;pen&s;ing the glad tidings of &s;alvation by a Redeemer; and &s;aluting the &s;everal churches, which he had been in&s;trumental in forming in the name and under the authority of his divine Ma&s;ter, until he arrived at Ephe&s;us. There behold him in the mid&s;t of his beloved church, whom by the in&s;trumentality of his preaching, the grace of God had converted to the chri&s;tian faith. To whom the felt him&s;elf attached by every tender and endearing &s;entiment. For whom he had been willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent, that he might bring them to Chri&s;t. And whom he had now a&s;&s;embled, for the purpo&s;e of bidding a final farewell. And of commending
<PB N="10" REF="025565_0010_0FCDFDBA85118028">
them to God and the word of his grace. See with what confidence he appeals to the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who be&s;t knew him, whether he had not di&s;charged with fidelity the duties of his Apo&s;tle|&s;hip. "Ye know (&s;aid he) from the fir&s;t day that I came into A&s;ia, after what manner I have been with you at all &s;ea&s;ons, &s;erving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befel me by the lying in wait of the Jews; and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have &s;hewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e: Te&s;tifying both to the Jews and al&s;o to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Though as a di&s;ciple of the crucified Je&s;us, no di&s;couragements, however great, were &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;uade the Apo&s;tle from his determined pur|po&s;e; or even to check his re&s;olution to &s;erve the cau&s;e in which his whole &s;ould was engaged. Yet as a man, he could not but feel the injuries he had &s;u&s;tained, and the ungrateful returns, which had been made by &s;ome of his barbarous and un|feeling countrymen, to his mo&s;t vigorous exer|tions to promote the real happine&s;s of his fellow mortals. And therefore, in this la&s;t public addre&s;s to his beloved brethren in Chri&s;t, he could not help adverting to them And by pa&s;t experience taught, he looks forward in expectation of farther trials and afflictions from the malice and hatred of tho&s;e, who are oppo&s;ed to the intere&s;t of the Redeemer's kingdom; and the di&s;cipline of that

holy religion, who&s;e mild and benevolent precepts di&s;countenance the angry pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart, and requires that hatred and revenge &s;hould give place to the grateful emotions of love, cha|rity, mutual forbearance, forgivene&s;s and compa&s;|&s;ion: Of that religion, which is not armed with vengeance, to de&s;tory the humble penitent; But is ever ready to drop the tear of condolence over the unhappy; and to guide the unwary &s;tep into the paths of peace and truth: Of that religion, which has for its objects, the glory of the Deity, and the honour, and the happine&s;s of all mankind; Which in&s;pires each individual of its &s;incere vota|ries, with &s;uch ardent and diffu&s;ive benevolence, as &s;hall draw forth his &s;oul to the great Father of all, in this devout addre&s;s.</P>

<P><Q>And now (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) behold, I go bound in &s;pirit unto Jeru&s;alem, not knowing the things that &s;hall befal me there. Save that the holy Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;eth in every city, &s;aying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.</Q> But while the Apo&s;tle anticipates the evils and dangers attend|ant on the di&s;charge of his mini&s;try, he nobly ri&s;es &s;uperior to all his apprehen&s;ions; And fired with an heroic ardor, he &s;ets danger, and even death, in open de&s;iance. <Q>But none of the&s;e things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="025565_0012_0FCDFDBF1BEF0040">
with joy, and the mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God.</Q></P>
<P>O happy Apo&s;tle! Who would not wi&s;h to emulate thy re&s;olution, who has a clear pro&s;pect of the rewards that will crown fidelity, in the immediate pre&s;ence, and under the almighty pro|tection of thy God? Above the reach of envy; and where the rage of per&s;ections can never harm thee! Thou ha&s;t fulfilled the mini&s;try, which thou did&s;t receive of thy ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter: Thou ha&s;t faithfully te&s;tified to a deluded, misjudging world the go&s;pel of the grace of God. And thou ha&s;t fini&s;hed thy cour&s;e with joy. For in the near pro&s;pect of death; while on the confines of the eternal world, thou wa&s;t able to look back with &s;atisfaction on thy pa&s;t life. And rejoicing in thy pro&s;pects of future glory, thou wa&s;t able to &s;ay, I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righ|teous judge &s;hall give me at that day.</P>
<P>But although the Apo&s;tle Paul has fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and is now at re&s;t in the abodes of bli&s;s; yet the cau&s;e, which he &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully plead, is not brought to a final i&s;&s;ue. Nor will it be, un|til all the wandering tribes of Adam's race are brought home to their father's hou&s;e. Until the children of men &s;hall be per&s;uaded to &s;eek one
<PB N="13" REF="025565_0013_0FCDFDC083B94AF8">
common intere&s;t; and be united in one happy family. Until the ferocity of the lion &s;hall give place to the Inoffen&s;ivene&s;s of the lamb; and <Q>the leopard &s;hall lie down with the kid. When the envy of Ephraim &s;hall depart, and the adver&s;aries of Judah &s;hall be cut off. When Ephraim &s;hall not envy Judah, and Judah &s;hall not vex Ephraim. When the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea; and when there &s;hall be nothing to hurt or de&s;troy in all his holy mountain.</Q> An con&s;ummation this, devoutly to be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King of Zion continues to &s;end his Amba&s;&s;adors to the children of men; and the religion of the Redeemer, has this day an advocate in every hone&s;t heart.</P>
<P>The faithful mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, are the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of St. Paul in the &s;erviee of the &s;ame Ma&s;ter. Like him they mu&s;t expect to encounter innumerable difficulties; and like him, they mu&s;t re&s;olve, relying on divine grace, to &s;urmount them all. And, in oppo&s;ition to the pa&s;&s;ions and the prejudices of ungodly men, they mu&s;t determine faithfully to di&s;charge the duties of their impor|tant, and very difficult &s;tation.</P>
<P>But alas! how few of tho&s;e who take upon them the &s;acred office of the mini&s;try, can affirm with the confidence of the Apo&s;tle, that they have not in any thing been deficient? Mini&s;ters are but men: &s;ubject to like pa&s;&s;ions with their fellow mortals: and expo&s;ed to all the frailties and in|firmities
<PB N="14" REF="025565_0014_0FCDFDC218046060">
of human nature. Perfection is not attainable by them; nor ought it to be expected from them. It is true, however, that the &s;acred office which they &s;u&s;tain, places them in an ele|vated point of view. They are therefore, under peculiar obligations to u&s;e the utmo&s;t circum|&s;pection in their conver&s;ation and deportment; and to cau&s;e their light &s;o to &s;hine before men, that others, &s;eeing their good works, may a glorify their heavenly Father. Tho&s;e who are con&s;tituted &s;acred guides to a benighted world, &s;hould be careful to have tho&s;e rays of divine wi&s;dom and knowledge, which have been communicated to them, from the father of lights, di&s;&s;u&s;e their benign influence, on all around them. The mini&s;try which they have received of the Lord, &s;hould always hold the fir&s;t place in their thoughts; and whatever di&s;couragements may avait them, in the execution of their important tru&s;t, they ought never to de&s;pair. But to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God in their lives and in their preach|ing, &s;hould always be their &s;ingle aim. Although enemies &s;hould per&s;ecute, and friends betray them. Though they &s;hould be made the &s;corn and deri|&s;ion of the mad multitude. Though poverty and ruin, de&s;truction and death &s;hould &s;tare them in the face; yet none of the&s;e things &s;hould move them, neither &s;hould their lives be dear unto them|&s;elves, when &s;et in competition with their faith&punc; But with a firm reliance on divine &s;upport; and with un&s;haken confidence in him, in who&s;e cau&s;e they are engaged: they &s;hould not &s;hun to declare
<PB N="15" REF="025565_0015_0FCDFDC39332CF68">
the whole coun&s;el of God, though all the powers of darkne&s;s &s;hould ari&s;e in oppo&s;ition to it. Ani|mated by the plea&s;ing con&s;ideration, that in thus doing, they may fini&s;h their cour&s;e with joy; they will ri&s;e above the fear of every di&s;a&s;terous event in this life; and look forward to the hour of death in grateful expectation.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the work of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, is difficult and arduous, as well as infinitely important. Our adorable Saviour, hav|ing redeemed our fallen race, from the ruins of apo&s;tacy, by his own &s;ufferings and death; not only exhibited in his own character, that temper and conduct, which his di&s;ciples &s;hould imitate: but e&s;tabli&s;hed his church under &s;pecial ordi|nances; and publi&s;hed that &s;y&s;tem of faith and morals, through which he would have the child|ren of men qualified for the heavenly world. And that mankind might be in&s;tructed in the knowledge of the divine will; and be per&s;uaded to embrace him, as the only mediator, through whom they may become reconciled to their of|fended Maker, receive the pardon of all their &s;ins, and obtain the final and everla&s;ting &s;alvation of their &s;ouls: he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to ordain and appoint a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of go&s;pel teachers; who &s;hould bear rule in his church; admini&s;ter the ordinances of his go&s;pel; impre&s;s the &s;eals of his covenant; &s;olemnly warn and exhort in his name; preach him, in his per&s;on, character and offices; and declare the whole coun&s;el of God, to the
<PB N="16" REF="025565_0016_0FCDFDC4EBA34F78">
conviction and conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and to the edification, comfort and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;aints. It is therefore the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter to watch, that he may be in&s;tru|mental in &s;aving &s;ouls. Great will be his reward, if he is faithful in the di&s;charge of his duty; and &s;olemn will be the account, which he mu&s;t give to his divine Ma&s;ter if he is not. While expo&s;ed to the wicked and malicious di&s;po&s;itions of man|kind, he has to conflict with many temptations to for&s;ake Chri&s;t, and to abandon his cau&s;e: but they are all confined to the pre&s;ent term of his exi&s;tence: while he has many great and precious promi&s;es, to encourage him to per&s;evere in his attachment to the truth, and the intere&s;ts of his Redeemer, which &s;hall have their full accompli&s;h|ment in the eternal world.</P>
<P>Although the word faithfully preached, will prove the &s;avor of life unto life, unto all them who hear and obey it; and a favor of death unto death, to tho&s;e who di&s;regard it: yet the doctrines of grace and &s;alvation by Chri&s;t; which it is the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter to preach; are &s;o extremely ungrateful to a great part of mankind; that the preacher is too often made the object of their unrighteous re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t examplary life, and unblemi&s;hed cha|racter, are not always &s;ecure from the &s;hafts of malice and detraction. With the bittere&s;t invete|racy the hardened Jews per&s;ecuted the holy Lamb of God; and abu&s;ed him with every term
<PB N="17" REF="025565_0017_0FCDFDC787DA6040">
of reproach, with which their ingenuity could furni&s;h them. And when (while they inhumanly &s;ought his life) our Lord &s;aid unto them, many good works have I &s;hewed you from my Father, for which of the&s;e works do ye &s;tone me? They made him this unfeeling reply. For a good work we &s;tone thee not, but for bla&s;phemy, and becau&s;e that thou being a man, make&s;t thy&s;elf God. Implying that he was an infamous impo&s;tor, endeavouring to practi&s;e upon the credulity of the multitude. And if the&s;e things were done in a green tree, what can we expect in a dry? If men have called the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e Beelzebub, how much more will they call tho&s;e of his hou&s;|hold? If he, who is the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on, could not pa&s;s through this cen&s;orious world, without meeting the bittere&s;t reproaches of tho&s;e whom he died to &s;ave, his frail and imperfect di&s;ciples cannot rea&s;onably expect any thing better.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t faithful &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t that ever exi&s;ted, falls infinitely &s;hort of his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter. Even the mo&s;t vigilant and circum&s;pect of tho&s;e who &s;u&s;tain the &s;acred office of the go&s;|pel mini&s;try have not only abundant occa&s;ion to humble them&s;elves before God, on account of their numberle&s;s imperfections; but they likewi&s;e frequently &s;tand in need of the candor and charity of their fellow men&mdash;Of tho&s;e to whom it is their duty to come, in the name of the Lord, de|claring his hatred of all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.

from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion? Could that divine and hea|venly principle which &s;uffereth long and is kind, which vaunteth not it&s;elf, and rejoiceth not in iniquity; could that cardinal virtue, which is the ba&s;is of all true religion, maintain the place it merits in the hearts of men, they would be mer|cile&s;s only to tho&s;e errors and imperfections which they find in them&s;elves. But unhappily for the peace, the harmony and &s;ecurity of tho&s;e who &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed for the exerci&s;e of all the chri&s;tain virtues, they are generally the mo&s;t quick&s;ighted in di&s;cerning, and the mo&s;t &s;evere in cen&s;uring the faults of others, who need the thicke&s;t veil to conceal their own.</P>
<P>But &s;o long as the mild and gentle &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity &s;hall warm the hearts of the wi&s;e and good; &s;o long, &s;hall the humble and &s;incere, though imperfect &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, find a place in their e&s;teem. Wherever he goes, their be&s;t wi&s;hes will attend him; and their devout and &s;ervent prayers will be, that God may pro|tect and ble&s;s him.</P>
<P>Virtuous friend&s;hip is an exalted pa&s;&s;ion. It is the key that opens to all the &s;ocial affections. It is the &s;ecret and delicate, though firm and in|&s;eparable ligament that unites congenial &s;ouls; and con&s;titutes the tendere&s;t attachments that nature knows. It &s;eeketh not its own aggran|dizement, but the happine&s;s of others. It &s;ets no bounds to its kind and beneficent offices. It begins in virtuous &s;ouls upon earth, and will be con&s;ummated in heaven.</P>

The full force of this divine pa&s;&s;ion the Apo&s;tle Paul felt for his beloved Church at Ephe&s;us; and in their brea&s;ts it met a generous return. It was this that cemented their mutual affections, and rendered the thoughts of their &s;eparation &s;o ex|tremely painful.</P>
<P>But perfect happine&s;s has not place below the &s;kies. Even the joys of virtuous friend&s;hip are embittered, by the &s;ad recollection, that the objects of our fonde&s;t affections mu&s;t &s;oon be parted from us.</P>
<P>Behold, the &s;hip is already launched; the breeze ari&s;es, and the canva&s;s &s;wells; the moment, the affecting moment, is arrived, when Paul mu&s;t take his la&s;t farewell of his Ephe&s;ian friends. His &s;oul, which had maintained its firmne&s;s through all his &s;ufferings, and nobly ro&s;e &s;uperior to all the dangers with which he was threatened, is now &s;ubdued by love. I &s;ee his virtuous conflict, with all the tender pa&s;&s;ions; while I hear him &s;ay, Now behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, &s;hall &s;ee my face no more.</P>
<P>And while I &s;peak of his attachment to his beloved Church, methinks I feel my heart glow, with the &s;ame exalted pa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e, of whom I &s;hall, this day, publicly take my leave. But, as on parting with his friends, Paul recommended them to God, and the word of his grace: So, after his example, and by your indulgence, I wi&s;h to take my leave of you, my friends, this afternoon.&mdash;</P>

<P>AS the offices and duties of an evangelical teacher are &s;olemn and &s;acred, &s;o the connexion that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between him and the church and people to whom he has &s;tatedly admini&s;tered the ordinances, and di&s;pen&s;ed the doctrines of the go&s;pel, is tender, intere&s;ting and important. They are equally intere&s;ted in all religious truths; they are accountable to the &s;ame Lord, for their fidelity to each other; for their fidelity to Chri&s;t, and to the intere&s;ts of his kingdom.</P>
<P>The day is not far di&s;tant, when every &s;ervant of the Lord Je&s;us mu&s;t give an account of his &s;teward&s;hip; and when all tho&s;e who have been favored with the means of grace mu&s;t appear be|fore the tribunal of Jehovah, and &s;hew how they have improved under them. Then if he, to whom has been intru&s;ted the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel of the grace of God, &s;hall be found to have been faithful to his &s;acred, tru&s;t, and to the all-important cau&s;e in which he has been employed: If it &s;hall then appear, that he has not &s;hunned to declare the whole coun&s;el of God; and that he is pure from the blood of all; he &s;hall then be owned; approved and honoured by his divine Ma&s;ter, who is his final judge. And an unfading crown of glory in the heavens &s;hall reward him for all
<PB N="21" REF="025565_0021_0FCDFDD184C50220">
his &s;ervices and his &s;ufferings upon earth. Not|with&s;tanding, while in this &s;tate of trial and di&s;ci|pline, he may be (as his ma&s;ter was before him) de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men, and regarded by &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals, as one who is &s;tricken, &s;mitten of God and afflicted; and per&s;ecuted by their relentle&s;s rage even unto &s;trange cities.</P>
<P>Happy is that mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, who&s;e life has uniformly corre&s;ponded with the go&s;pel he has preached. And happy is that people who have realized the worth of &s;uch a faithful &s;ervant of their a&s;cended Lord, and obeyed the precepts of the go&s;pel which he has inculcated. They may look on death without one di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ap|prehen&s;ion. And with un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction, they can anticipate that &s;olemn moment, when they &s;hall again unite at the impartial bar of their righteous Judges; receive his applaudit, and ac|company each other to tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed abodes where all virtuous friends &s;hall meet, and part no more through the unmea&s;urable ages of an endle&s;s eter|nity. Such a mini&s;ter was the apo&s;tle Paul, and &s;uch were tho&s;e who compo&s;ed his church at Ephe&s;us. And therefore, while he bids them a long farewell, expecting never more to &s;ee them upon earth; he can confidently affirm, that he is pure from the blood of all men. And that he has not &s;hunned to declare unto them all the coun&s;el of God. This great Apo&s;tle is an example to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in &s;ufferings and in patience; in word, in charity, in faith and in purity. But
<PB N="22" REF="025565_0022_0FCDFDD376397C28">
there are but few however of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who do not fall &s;hort of the example he has &s;et them. The height of their pretentions in general is, that they have endeavoured to walk worthy of their high and holy vocation; and that they have not willingly &s;hunned to declare all the coun&s;el of God.</P>
<P>This, my friends, is the mo&s;t that I pretend to. Many are the imperfections of my life, and great is my need of pardoning mercy, and renovating grace. With a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive temper of mind, I would notice the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine provi|dence towards me. And I would a&s;cribe righte|ou&s;ne&s;s to my Maker, under all his dealings with me. I would cultivate and cheri&s;h the temper of the meek and lowly Je&s;us, in which he &s;aid to the Roman governor, "Thou coulde&s;t have no power at all again&s;t me, expect it were given thee from above." And of holy David, when under his &s;evere&s;t trials and afflications, "Let Shimei cur&s;e, for the Lord hath bidden him." But my friends, I can with confidence appeal to the God who knows my heart, to witne&s;s the &s;incerity of my de&s;ires, to &s;erve him with fidelity, in the go&s;|pel of his Son. And that I have not, knowingly, kept back any thing that was profitable unto you, through the fear of man; or under the apprehen|&s;ion of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of tho&s;e, who do not conceive of &s;ome of the doctrines of the go&s;|pel in the &s;ame light with my&s;elf. It has been my uniform endeavour, to urge upon you all, the nece&s;&s;ity and the infinite importance of attending
<PB N="23" REF="025565_0023_0FCDFDD4E7C64428">
on the means of grace, and the in&s;titutions of our holy religion; to hold up to your view the moral &s;entiments and the practical duties of chri&s;tianity; and to te&s;tify to all, whatever their &s;peculative opinions might be, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And if I cannot &s;ay with the confidence of the Apo&s;tle in the text, that I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God; yet I can &s;ay, with as much &s;incerity as he felt, that I have not de|&s;ignedly neglected it. And if the mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes for your pre&s;ent peace and pro&s;perity, and for your future and eternal glory and happine&s;s, will ju&s;tify the a&s;&s;ertion, I can &s;ay, that I am pure from the blood of all men. I have wi&s;hed and prayed for your good, but I have never had in my heart to injure any individual of you. And though my &s;ervices and my &s;ufferings, my prayers and my tears, may not be felt or acknowledged by my fellow men; yet I have the heart-ani|mating &s;atisfaction of reflecting with holy Job, "that my witne&s;s is in heaven, and that my re|cord is on high." With him, "I know that my Redeemer lives."</P>
<P>Many, my friends, have been the evils with which I have been called to encounter, from my fir&s;t entering upon the work of the go&s;pel in this place. The envenomed tongue of the mo&s;t mali|cious &s;lander has been employed to wound my fame; my mo&s;t &s;tudious exertions to a&s;&s;ert and maintain, what I have received as the truths
<PB N="24" REF="025565_0024_0FCDFDD6229EB778">
of the go&s;pel, have been de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome as the warm effu&s;ions of an heretical brain. And my firm adherence to an incumbent duty has been con&s;tru|ed into ob&s;tinacy, and imputed to the want of an obliging di&s;po&s;tion. Sincere in my conce&s;&s;ions, and &s;anguine in my expectations, I have been betrayed in my confidence; and &s;een all my &s;aire&s;t pro&s;pects in a moment bla&s;ted. And now, &s;hall I &s;ay that none of the&s;e things move me? and that neither do I count my life dear unto my&s;elf? Yes, I will truly &s;ay it, if I may but fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God.</P>
<P>My brethren, I have not unfriendly pa&s;&s;ion to gratify. I have no di&s;po&s;ition to revenge upon the mo&s;t unfeeling of my enemies. I will not even &s;ay of them (as St. Paul &s;aid of Alexander the copper-&s;mith) they have done me much evil, the Lord reward them according to their works. No, but I will leave them with their God, and pray for the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls. I have no doubt, but that many who have taken a part in afflicting me, have been led to it through mi&s;|information, or the want of proper attention, or by the influence of bad advi&s;ers; which there|fore, I can freely overlook, and heartily forgive.</P>
<P>This world, my friends, is not our home, and when compared with the glories that are to be revealed, its intere&s;ts are not worth contending for. We are de&s;igned for another &s;tate of exi&s;|tence.
<PB N="25" REF="025565_0025_0FCDFDD925790098">
this life is but the dawn of that eternal day, to which we are as yet &s;carcely awakened. We enter upon this &s;tage of mortality in a pro|mi&s;cuous order; we here form various con|nexions which mu&s;t be all of &s;hort duration. Di&s;a&s;ter or death &s;oon di&s;unites us for a time; but we part, &s;oon to meet again.</P>
<P>You and I, my friends, have been connected under the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important of all relations; it is now di&s;&s;olved. Perhaps this is the la&s;t time we &s;hall ever behold each others faces upon earth. This is undoubtedly the la&s;t time you will ever hear my voice from this &s;acred de&s;k. But, my friends, we &s;oon &s;hall meet again; at the moment of our &s;eparation, we are all ha&s;tening, as fa&s;t as the wings of time can carry us, to unite with a whole a&s;&s;embled world, before the impartial bar of the dread Sovereign of the univer&s;e; who&s;e piercing eye now &s;earches the human heart, and tries the reins of the children of men. Yes, my friends, we mu&s;t &s;hortly, very &s;hortly, all appear before our Judge; where our late relation to each other will be brought into view. Where I mu&s;t give an account of the errors of my life, and for every neglect of my duty as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel of the grace of God; and where you, my friends, mu&s;t likewi&s;e give an account of the temper and di&s;po&s;ition with which you have attended on my mini&s;try, and the manner in which you have profited under it; and where you mu&s;t account not only for
<PB N="0026" REF="025565_0026_0FCDFDDAAEB6A610">
your conduct towards me as a chri&s;tian brother and a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter; but likewi&s;e for the motives which actuated you thereto. With plea&s;|ing hope and grateful expectation, I look forward to the events of that all-important period; and may God of his infinite compa&s;&s;ion and grace di&s;|po&s;e and enable each of us &s;o to rectify whatever has been ami&s;s, either in our temper or conduct, as that the approaching day of final retribution may be as happy as it mu&s;t be &s;olemn to us all.</P>
<P>But though this life is not the time to revenge injuries, but to forgive, and if po&s;&s;ible, to forget them; yet &s;urely it is a fit &s;eason for the grateful acknowledgement of benefits and kindne&s;&s;es. And therefore, it is with plea&s;ure, that I take this op|portunity publicly to acknowledge the many and repeated expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem which I have received from many of the people of this pari&s;h, from my fir&s;t coming among them to the pre&s;ent day. Be a&s;&s;ured, my friends, not the &s;malle&s;t token of your kindne&s;s has been pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. I have a lively remembrance of all your favors, it will accompany me wherever I go, and through whatever &s;cenes I may be called to pa&s;s. Although I may be lo&s;t to you, yet your friend&s;hip is not lo&s;t upon me, it has made &s;uch a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon my heart, as can never be cra&s;ed, until it is a&s;leep in the cold and &s;ilent grave. Accept my &s;incere thanks and mo&s;t devour good wi&s;hes; they are the only returns that are now in my power to make to all your benevo|lence: but they are a grateful offering, which a generous mind will not de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="0027" REF="025565_0027_0FCDFDDC6D4128C8">
It now remains, that I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified.</P>
<P>You have now a dangerous path to tread, with|out any &s;piritual guide to go before you in the exerci&s;es of public devotion. The Apo&s;tle, in our context, was extremely anxious for the peace and &s;ecurity of his beloved &s;tock at Ephe&s;us, when he could no longer be with them. For I know this, &s;aid he, that after my departing, &s;hall griev|ous wolves enter in among you, not &s;paring the flock. Al&s;o of your&s;elves &s;hall men ari&s;e, &s;peak|ing perver&s;e things, to draw away di&s;ciples after them. And, have I no longer any intere&s;t in you, my friends? God is my witne&s;s, who daily hears my prayers for his ble&s;&s;ings on you, that I have. Ye are now my brethren, who &s;o lately were the people of my charge. And as we are now about to take our leave of each other, to pur&s;ue (as I humbly hope) our journey to our heavenly Father's hou&s;e; I will offer you the parting cau|tion which Jo&s;eph gave to his brethren, when they left him, to go up from Egypt, to their father in Canaan.</P>
<P><Q>And he &s;aid upto them, &s;ee that ye fall not out by the way.</Q> Let me entreat you to forget all former prejudices, and endeavour to be recon|ciled to one other. Seek a &s;peedy re&s;ettlement of the go&s;pel among you, with &s;incere de&s;ires to profit
<PB N="0028" REF="025565_0028_0FCDFDE0C4D79FC0">
profit by the di&s;pen&s;ation of its doctrines and its precepts. If you can be united, you may yet be a happy and a re&s;pectable &s;ociety. But if malice and ill-will, if prejudice, hatred and re|venge, and every unfriendly and de&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ion are not &s;peedily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, your ruin is unavoid|able. Studiou&s;ly avoid therefore, all movements towards confu&s;ion and di&s;order. Study the things that make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. Seek to have the word of God di&s;pen&s;ed to you in its purity, and cheri&s;h the faith that was once delivered to the &s;aints. You have more pre&s;&s;ing motives to peace and union among your&s;elves, and more important con&s;iderations to prevent your falling out with each other, on your journey through the wilderne&s;s of this life, than the brethren of Joseph had, while they journeyed towards their native land.</P>
<P>You are all the offspring of God; the parent of the univer&s;e is the former of your bodies, and the father of your &s;pirits; he regards you as his children; he knows your infirmities, and is gra|ciou&s;ly attentive to your wants: Your exi&s;tence originated in his love, and you are all equally dependent on his bounty. He views no indivi|dual with a partial fondne&s;s, further than amia|blene&s;s of temper, and propriety of conduct, may ju&s;tly merit the di&s;tinction; but as a kind and indulgent parent, he delights in the peace and hap|pine&s;s of all his children.

And you are expre&s;sly exhorted to the cultivation of brotherly love by the great Redeemer of the world; who, that he might re|concile the children of men to one another, and &s;o prepare them for a reconciliation with offended Heaven, became an in&s;tructor and an example in this important duty; and has left it as the indi&s;putable evidence by which we are to prove that we are his di&s;ciples.&mdash;"For as I have loved you," &s;aid Chri&s;t, "&s;o ought ye al&s;o to love one ano|ther." And <Q>by this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to an|other.</Q> What a powerful motive &s;hould this be with you, to &s;uppre&s;s every unchri&s;tian and un|friendly thought, and on every occa&s;ion to mani|fe&s;t mutual love, kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In innumerable in&s;tances we have all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed against the righteous laws of God; and the need we all &s;tand in of his forgivene&s;s &s;hould teach us the rea&s;onablene&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of our being will|ing to forgive tho&s;e who may have offended us.

of the mind for, or again&s;t any particular object, previous to a proper enquiry into its nature; or, as the word it&s;elf imports, to judge before we examine; that is to judge by the pa&s;&s;ions rather than the under&s;tanding. Hence we &s;ee that per&s;ons of the warme&s;t pa&s;&s;ions are fre|quently the mo&s;t &s;ubjects to this foible. And opinions thus ra&s;hly taken up, without evidence, are called prejudices.

And then, through a weak mi&s;taken notion, that it is di&s;honorable to be convinced of an error, re&s;olve for the credit of their under&s;tand|ing, as they &s;uppo&s;e (but really at the expen&s;e of it) to retain and defend their error again&s;t all evidence of &s;en&s;e, fact and rea&s;on.
