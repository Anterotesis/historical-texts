<OPENER><SALUTE>MY BELOVED BRETHREN AND FRIENDS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of con&s;tant and indi&s;pen&s;able employment, in the line of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion in the Univer&s;ity, I have, twelve years, &s;erved you in the go&s;pel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. And, as I have had, during the whole of this time, the mo&s;t &s;ati&s;factory evidence of your candor and friend&s;hip, it affords me peculiar &s;ati&s;faction publicly to a&s;&s;ure you of my regard and be&s;t wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I rejoice in the pro&s;pect of your increa&s;ing re&s;pectability.</P>
<P>Since, probably, it cannot be practicable for me, much longer, to perform the agreeable &s;ervices, which my pre&s;ent relation, as your pa&s;tor and public teacher, requires, it gives relief to my anxiety for your happine&s;s, that you may &s;oon enjoy the labors of a mini&s;ter, who will be able to devote his time, without interruption, to in&s;truct and edify you.</P>
<P>That GOD may continue to ble&s;s you with pro&s;perity in this world; and finally grant you an inheritance among tho&s;e, who are &s;anctified, is the &s;incere de&s;ire of your affectionate friend.</P>

<BIBL>PSALM cxxxiv. 3.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The LORD, that made heaven and earth ble&s;s thee out of Zion</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHITHER &s;hall I go from thy &s;pirit? or whither &s;hall I flee from thy pre&s;ence?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxx<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">x 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>We know, that JEHOVAH is every where pre&s;ent, to hear the prayers of tho&s;e, who with &s;incerity and Godly fear invoke his name. He is however more e&s;pecially pre&s;ent, in the wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies of the faithful.</P>
<P>Why is the Lord &s;aid to give his ble&s;&s;ing out of Zion? becau&s;e there was his hou&s;e, where his name was recorded. Of &s;uch &s;olemn importance is a hou&s;e devoted to the pur|po&s;e of public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>When GOD would expre&s;s his love and kindne&s;s to his ancient profe&s;&s;ing people, he informed them, that he would &s;et his tabernacle in the mid&s;t of them. By this he intended, that he would be near them, to hear their petitions, and grant them his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>And, when his people apo&s;tatized, and provoked him to manife&s;t his great di&s;plea&s;ure, he deprived them of this privilege, which was, indeed, an awful puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>To wor&s;hip and adore the Creator is our rea&s;onable &s;ervice. To contemplate his perfections, prai&s;e his name, and celebrate the wonders of his love to the human kind, are employments grateful to the pious.</P>
<P>The public wor&s;hip of GOD is our indi&s;pen&s;able duty, both with regard to his glory, and our own intere&s;t. By this we profe&s;s that we are his &s;ervants, and that we ought to obey and glorify him.</P>
<P>As we depend upon GOD's ble&s;&s;ing for our lives, and all the happine&s;s we either enjoy in this world, or hope for in the future, it is his will, that we implore his favor in places where his name is recorded, and which are con|&s;ecrated to his honor.</P>
<P>Our Savior has promi&s;ed, that where two or three are
<PB N="7" REF="029528_0005_0FE1D98563D946D0">
gathered together in his name, he will grant them his presence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 20.</NOTE> Will he not then (to apply the words of the Psalmist) give a gracious ear to the prayers, which are made "in the great congregation?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxii. 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>We should come to GOD's house, to unite with sincere hearts in prayer and praise, and to hear the instructions of his word.</P>
<P>HERE, in the name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and with humble reliance on his grace and merits, we &s;hould pray our heavenly Father to pardon our &s;ins, which, if not forgiven, will plunge us in everla&s;ting ruin.</P>
<P>We &s;hould devoutly implore the quickening and &s;anc|tifying influences of his &s;pirit, without which we cannot plea&s;e GOD, nor be prepared for heaven. Here, we &s;hould render thanks to our adorable and merciful Crea|tor, for tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which we have no rea&s;on to expect will be continued, when we are &s;o ungrateful as not to ac|knowledge them.</P>
<P>"If there be dearth in the land, if there be pe&s;tilence, if there be bla&s;ting or mildew,&mdash;what&s;oever &s;ore, or what&s;oever &s;ickne&s;s there be: then what prayer, or what &s;upplication &s;oever &s;hall be made of any man, or of all thy people I&s;rael, when every one &s;hall know his own &s;ore, and his own grief, and &s;hall &s;pread forth his hands in this place: then hear thou from heaven, thy dwell|ing place." 2 Chron. vi. 28, 29, 30.</P>
<P>In the following chapter we are informed, "that GOD appeared to Solomon by night, and &s;aid unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have cho&s;en this place to my&s;elf. Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;es 12 and 15.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>This is the place, where his mini&s;ters are to in&s;truct the ignorant, alarm the carele&s;s, and con&s;ole the contrite in heart.</P>
<P>All, who de&s;ire and hope for the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, &s;hould, as they have opportunity, wait upon him in pub|lic wor&s;hip. And they &s;hould behave with decency and reverence, con&s;idering they are in the pre&s;ence of their Creator and final Judge.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="029528_0006_0FE1D98703887AE0">
Were we to appear before a chief Magi&s;trate, we &s;hould fear to in&s;ult him.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we &s;hould wi&s;h to behave re&s;pect|fully in his pre&s;ence, and obtain his approbation. Were we to implore his forgivene&s;s of an offence, we &s;hould act with humility. Did we reque&s;t a favor of him, we &s;hould addre&s;s him with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his good plea&s;ure. Were we to pre&s;ent him our thanks for a favor received, we &s;hould behave &s;o as to appear &s;en&s;ible of our obligation.</P>
<P>GOD requires an outward as well as inward wor&s;hip. He is di&s;plea&s;ed with all indecent behavior in &s;o &s;olemn an exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>"A &s;on,', &s;ays GOD, "honoreth his father, and a &s;er|vant his ma&s;ter; if then I be a Father, where is my hon|or? and if I be a ma&s;ter, where is my fear? And if ye offer the blind for &s;acrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and &s;ick, is it not evil? Offer it now to thy governor; will he be plea&s;ed with thee?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal i. 6. and 8.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>Thus, the Great GOD is very jealous of his honor, and di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch as do not behave with reverence in his wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>If we trifle, or behave indecently, he is di&s;plea&s;ed, as a father with the di&s;re&s;pect of a &s;on, or a ma&s;ter with the ill behavior of a &s;ervant.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that a decent and reverent beha|vior, in the public wor&s;hip of GOD, tends to &s;olemnize the mind, and impre&s;s an idea of our obligation to &s;erve and adore him. Thus the prie&s;ts were commanded to weep between the porch and the altar, that they might be im|pre&s;&s;ed in a manner &s;uitable to the offices they were to per|form.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 17.</NOTE> Our bodies as well as &s;ouls are GOD's; and we are commanded to wor&s;hip and glorify him with both.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, however, remember, that no outward acts are plea&s;ing to GOD, in his wor&s;hip, any further than they are expre&s;&s;ions of holy exerci&s;es of heart, or means to impre&s;s us with a &s;en&s;e of our dependance upon his grace and kind providence.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;e of GOD, we &s;hould attend, not only to the
<PB N="9" REF="029528_0007_0FE1D9889E9D8640">
precepts and in&s;tructions contained in his holy word, but al&s;o to his wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, di&s;played in the creation and government of the world.</P>
<P>"The heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firma|ment &s;heweth his handy work. There is no &s;peech nor language, where their voice is not heard.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xix. 1. and 3.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>The Great GOD is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting. To him pertains every po&s;&s;ible perfection. He walks in the circuit of heaven; his eyes run to and fro through|out the earth. Hell it&s;elf is open before him, and de&s;|truction has no covering. The clouds are his chariots, and the winds his me&s;&s;engers. All the elements fulfil his commands. Darkne&s;s is his pavilion. The earth is his foot&s;tool; and in the deep waters his wonders are &s;een.</P>
<P>All nature is his temple, and all &s;pace is his abode. Every creature is the workman&s;hip of his hands; and over all his gracious providence extends.</P>
<P>Creation is full of GOD. He has his way in the whirlwind; he &s;ends abroad his lightnings; he gives &s;now like wool, and &s;catters the hoarfro&s;t like a&s;hes. If we a&s;cend into heaven, he is there; if we go down into hell, he is al&s;o there. In the former reigns his infinite mer|cy, in the latter his everla&s;ting ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, behave with reverence and godly fear, when in &s;olemn wor&s;hip, we pre&s;ent our&s;elves before the omni&s;cient Creator.</P>
<P>Great and important advantages ari&s;e from the prac|tice of public wor&s;hip, when rightly performed. Were piety and devotion bani&s;hed from the earth, ju&s;tice and fidelity would not long remain. Wickedne&s;s, could it e&s;cape human ob&s;ervation, would prevail and triumph. Were men relea&s;ed from all apprehen&s;ions of a &s;upreme Being, to whom they are accountable, oaths would be in|&s;ignificant, and confidence among&s;t men entirely de&s;troy|ed. In that ca&s;e, a man could not &s;afely tru&s;t a friend; he would every where be in danger of injuries from his fellow creatures. Thus, if the fear of GOD were removed
<PB N="10" REF="029528_0008_0FE1D98A47696A48">
from men's minds, human life would be thrown into the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, and the bonds of &s;ociety unhappily di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>By what means can a &s;uitable &s;en&s;e of GOD and his divine providence be &s;o effectually diffu&s;ed, as by meet|ing together, and joining in the exerci&s;es of public wor|&s;hip? &s;ince &s;ociety could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without religion, and this could not be maintained without the public wor&s;hip of GOD, it is incumbent on every friend to man|kind to encourage it by his influence and example. Such then as habitually ab&s;ent them&s;elves from public wor|&s;hip, cannot an&s;wer, for the neglect, to GOD, nor their neighbor. And they injure them&s;elves; for &s;incere and rational wor&s;hip is both agreeable, and improving to the mind.</P>
<P>Do you wi&s;h to become wi&s;er and better? do you de|&s;ire to obtain the pardon of your &s;ins, through JESUS CHRIST? Would you increa&s;e in piety, which is the on|ly &s;ource of peace in life, hope in death, and happine&s;s eternal? "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD."</P>
<P>Although neither the hearing of GOD's word, nor any means, of them&s;elves, can effect our &s;alvation, yet, while we wilfully neglect them, we harden our hearts in &s;in, and go far from GOD. The Holy Gho&s;t is the efficient of the new creation; he operates, however, on the minds of men, in the u&s;e of means.</P>
<P>To adore our Creator, as the univer&s;al Parent, will re|mind us of our near relation to all mankind, and, thus, &s;trengthen in our brea&s;ts the noble&s;t &s;entiments of hu|manity. By reflecting on his adorable perfections, if we wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and truth, our minds will be im|pre&s;&s;ed with becoming reverence.</P>
<P>If, with true hearts, and in full a&s;&s;urance of faith, we ad|dre&s;s him in prayer, we &s;hall improve in that re&s;ig|nation to his providence, and tru&s;t in his power and goodne&s;s, which will &s;upport and animate us through the changing &s;cenes of life, and afford us con&s;olation, when fle&s;h and heart &s;hall fail.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="029528_0009_0FE1D993555FFC20">
Frequently to repeat the&s;e exerci&s;es will tend to in|&s;pire us with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence and in|&s;pection, as will, at all times, be a happy guard to our in|nocence and virtue. Indeed, every part of public wor|&s;hip is adapted to meliorate the heart, and, con&s;equently, to exalt human nature.</P>
<P>Although we have rea&s;on to lament the profanene&s;s and impiety of the pre&s;ent age, yet there are many men of learning and influence, who labor to promote the cau&s;e of piety and virtue. Religion has many friends of whom &s;he is not a&s;hamed. The&s;e are the wi&s;e, the humane, and the virtuous.</P>
<P>Who are her enemies? they are the enemies of man|kind; the idle and the vicious.</P>
<P>If you engage in the wor&s;hip of GOD with &s;incere hearts, in the exerci&s;e of faith and love, with your minds free from guilt and &s;uper&s;tition,&mdash;if you believe in GOD, as the merciful Father of all,&mdash;if, with humble dependance on the atonement and interce&s;&s;ion of CHRIST, you adore him with pious affections, experience will teach you, that devotion affords the mo&s;t exalted plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The human mind is never &s;o much plea&s;ed, as when employed in viewing and admiring great and &s;ublime objects. What object is &s;o great and &s;ublime as the eter|nal GOD? In contemplating him, we are pre&s;ented with a view of the mo&s;t perfect glory and excellence.</P>
<P>And do we not experience &s;ati&s;faction ari&s;ing from a grateful &s;en&s;e of our obligations to that Almighty and Merciful Being, on whom we ever depend?</P>
<P>Thus to adore our common Parent, the Parent of an|gels as well as men, the governor of the univer&s;e, who will graciou&s;ly reward his faithful &s;ervants, mu&s;t be a plea&s;ing employment, and afford the mo&s;t &s;ublime enter|tainment to pious and generous minds.</P>
<P>Thus exalted are the plea&s;ures of devotion.</P>
<P>Society heightens every rational delight. The melo|dy of &s;ounds, the fair pro&s;pects of nature, and our inter|cour&s;e with each other, become more agreeable, when
<PB N="12" REF="029528_0010_0FE1D99516F43C68">
the plea&s;ure they afford is communicated from brea&s;t to brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In like manner, the plea&s;ure of devotion, although highly &s;atisfactory to one, who adores GOD in private, may, however, be increa&s;ed and more elevated, in a wor|&s;hipping a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>It is the character of an un&s;ocial and &s;ullen &s;pirit to a|void the places of public wor&s;hip. A man of true be|nevolence enjoys peculiar plea&s;ure in &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, in beholding a number of his &s;pecies engaged in the adora|tion of their common Creator and Redeemer, and the im|provement of their minds.</P>
<P>A man of undi&s;&s;embled piety, wor&s;hipping with tho&s;e of the &s;ame character, gathers joy from every counte|nance.</P>
<P>To join, therefore, in public wor&s;hip with the pious conduces to kindle and enhance our own devotion. If here we experience not a divine &s;ati&s;faction, we have rea&s;on to fear, that our &s;ouls are devoid of piety.</P>
<P>I add, that devoutly to wor&s;hip GOD in the a&s;&s;emblies of his people has a happy tendency to fit us for the em|ployments and plea&s;ures of the world of glory. When the &s;oul &s;hall for&s;ake its pre&s;ent habitation, the plea&s;ures which depend upon the body will all vani&s;h. The hap|pine&s;s of the heavenly &s;tate depends on &s;piritual entertain|ments. It con&s;i&s;ts in the love and exerci&s;e of virtue, and in the love, prai&s;e, and adoration of the &s;ource of felicity. May we, therefore, purifying our&s;elves from &s;in, be pre|pared by devotion, and all the means, which infinite wi&s;dom has appointed, for the exalted &s;tate and employ|ments of the &s;aints in light.</P>
<P><HI>Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e ideas let us attend to our &s;ituation.</HI></P>
<P>Twenty five years ago the College was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and mea&s;ures were taken to form a &s;ettlement, in this part of the town of Hanover. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers were few, and &s;ubjected to many inconveniences and difficulties, as this part of the country was an uncultivated wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="029528_0011_0FE1D996B0568300">
The twenty third day of January next will complete the term of twenty five years, &s;ince this church was imbodied.</P>
<P>The public wor&s;hip of GOD has been, without inter|ruption, attended in this vicinity, from the time of its fir&s;t &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>During the late war, the progre&s;s of improvement was greatly retarded. From the conclu&s;ion of that war, to the pre&s;ent time, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD its increa&s;e has been con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Although we are not a large &s;ociety, yet the con&s;ider|ation of public occa&s;ions frequently occurring early led the minds of the &s;ettlers to view the expediency, that a hou&s;e for the accommodation of large numbers be &s;pa|cious and convenient.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration, together with that of the &s;mallne&s;s of the number of inhabitants, occa&s;ioned the delay of mea&s;ures for erecting a hou&s;e for the purpo&s;e of public wor&s;hip, and to be u&s;ed for tho&s;e other public purpo&s;es, until the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider how few have a&s;&s;ociated for the de|&s;ign of building this hou&s;e, which was begun but a little more than a year ago, and which is now, at their reque&s;t, and in their behalf, to be dedicated to the wor&s;hip and honor of GOD, we have rea&s;on to acknowledge his good|ne&s;s, in granting &s;ucce&s;s to the undertaking.</P>
<P>As public, &s;ocial wor&s;hip is due from mankind to their Creator, it is &s;uitable, that hou&s;es erected for this pur|po&s;e be con&s;ecrated to his &s;ervice. In them he has been plea&s;ed to record his name, and to honor them with the appellation of his dwelling places.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, my beloved brethren and friends, with united hearts, and one accord, be&s;eech the LORD GOD, who gives his ble&s;&s;ing out of Zion, to be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to accept this our offering, WHICH WE DE|DICATE TO HIS NAME.</P>
<P>Here, may a divine ble&s;&s;ing attend his word, and the admini&s;tration of his ordinances, to his glory, and the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls of multitudes, who may, in this hou&s;e, hear the joyful &s;ound of the go&s;pel, even glad tid|ings
<PB N="14" REF="029528_0012_0FE1D9984F87E038">
from heaven for &s;inful men, who will accept of mercy through the Mediator, and, "by patient continu|ance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, and honor, and im|mortality."</P>
<P>The LORD, that made heaven and earth, ble&s;s you out of Zion.</P>
