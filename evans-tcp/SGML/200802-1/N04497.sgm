<P>I Have lately had a Sight of a printed <HI>Letter</HI> from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> Rector of the College at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> to his Friend in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> concerning that he has declared that he heard me &s;ay, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> told me, of a De&s;ign he had, of turning out the Generality of the Mini&s;ters in the Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;wherein he cites <HI>two Letters</HI> that I &s;ent to him about that Affair. The Repre&s;entation he makes of what I &s;aid in tho&s;e Letters, make it nece&s;&s;ary, in my Opinion, that <HI>tho&s;e Letters</HI> &s;hould be <HI>publi&s;hed at large.</HI> I therefore here &s;end you a Copy of each of them; and would pray you to publi&s;h them as &s;oon as may be.</P>
<P>The LETTERS are as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Copy of the fir&s;t Letter cited by the Rev. Mr. Clap.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. <HI>Sir,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have often heard that you, when you was down at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> the Summer pa&s;t, did be|fore many Per&s;ons, declare that you heard me &s;ay, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> told me, that he had a De&s;ign of turning out of their Places, the greater Part of the Mini&s;ters in <HI>New-England,</HI> and of &s;upplying their Pulpits with Mini&s;ters from <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire|land.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="005581_0003_1018AF9E1AC52640">
Particularly Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Pomfret</HI> told me that he was there, and heard you &s;ay it: But only in|&s;tead of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;ays, that you &s;aid to him, <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> And &s;ays that he could &s;carcely believe it: and therefore was particular in enquiring of you; taking Care that he might not mi&s;under&s;tand you: and you a&s;&s;erted to him more than once. <HI>I was exceedingly a&s;toni&s;hed to hear it;</HI> not only <HI>becau&s;e that I knew that I never had &s;aid it to you, nor to any Mortal,</HI> as well as it is po&s;&s;ible for me to know a Negative, or to know that I had not &s;aid any Thing what&s;oever that could be mention'd; but al&s;o, becau&s;e <HI>when I fir&s;t heard this Report, the Thought of Mr.</HI> Whitefield'<HI>s &s;aying any &s;uch Thing, was perfectly new to me.</HI> Indeed I heard Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> &s;ay that he had Thoughts of bringing over a Number of young Men from <HI>England,</HI> into the <HI>Jer|&s;eys</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to be ordain'd by the <HI>Tennents;</HI> but &s;aid not one Word of any De&s;ign of their &s;upply|ing the Pulpits of other Mini&s;ters (made vacant by their being turn'd out) either <HI>there,</HI> or in <HI>New-Eng|land.</HI> I have al&s;o on &s;ome Occa&s;ions mention'd it <HI>as my Opinion,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> was <HI>formerly</HI> in the Opinion and Scheme of People's for&s;aking un|converted Mini&s;ters, which po&s;&s;ibly you might hear of from others; for I have no Remembrance of my ever having any Conver&s;ation with you about Things of this Nature; and think it on &s;ome Accounts very unlikely that I &s;hould; I have had but very little Opportunity of Conver&s;ation with you, as you know, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has been in the Country; and I have always known that your Thoughts of Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and the late Work, were generally &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="005581_0004_1018AFF9441136C8">
to be diver&s;e from mine, and le&s;s favourable: It is much more unlikely on that Account, that I &s;hould enter into Conver&s;ation with you, tending to confirm Prejudices again&s;t Mr. <HI>Whitefield.</HI> But how|ever, THIS I DECLARE, <HI>that I have no Manner of Remembrance that I ever heard Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>ex|pre&s;s, or hint any De&s;ign he had of turning out the grea|ter Part of the Mini&s;ters of</HI> New-England, <HI>or any Part of them, and introducing others into their Places, from</HI> Great Britain <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>or any other Place, or any Thing like it; nor have I any Imagination that I ever heard Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>&s;ay any Thing of this Na|ture, any more than that I heard him &s;ay he had a De|&s;ign of dethroning the</HI> great Turk, <HI>and introducing a</HI> new Sultan <HI>to &s;it upon his Throne:</HI> And I have equal Rea&s;on to be confident that I never repre&s;ented, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> &s;aid the former, as I have, that I ne|ver repre&s;ented that he &s;aid the latter. If I have ever reported any &s;uch Thing to you, who are at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from me, and with whom I have had &s;o little Conver&s;ation; it is exceeding likely that I have told others the &s;ame; But I challenge the whole World be&s;ides you, to &s;ay that they ever heard me &s;ay any &s;uch Thing. <HI>Therefore I de&s;ire you to do</HI> me <HI>and Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>the Ju&s;tice, as publickly to correct your Mi&s;take</HI> in this, which you have &s;o publickly de|clared; which I perceive has been very much taken Notice of, and has been much the Subject of Talk. <HI>I can't but think, that when you come to con&s;ider of the Matter, you will &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible that you have been greatly mi&s;taken; and have by &s;ome Means or other, &s;trangely confounded Things in your Mind; and that Ju&s;tice and Integrity will con&s;train you &s;peedily to de|clare

<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Copy of the &s;econd Letter cited by Mr. Clap.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. <HI>Sir,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Relation you give in your <HI>Letter</HI> of <HI>Octob.</HI> 12. of the Conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between us as we rode together through <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> the la&s;t <HI>May</HI> was <HI>Twelvemonth,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t amazing Things to me that ever I met with in my Life. I don't re|member our having any Conver&s;ation about Mr. <HI>Whitefield:</HI> But that might be, and I might forget it. But if I told &s;uch a Story about Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and what pa&s;s'd between him and me, with &s;o many Particulars and Circum&s;tances (which mu&s;t have been altogether of mine own Invention, <HI>without the lea&s;t Foundation in Truth</HI>) I don't believe I &s;hould have forgot it. I have &s;ometimes &s;aid to others, (as I informed you, in my late Letter to you) that <HI>I &s;uppo&s;ed</HI> that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> was <HI>formerly</HI> of the Opi|nion, that unconverted Mini&s;ters ought not to con|tinue in the Mini&s;try: And I do <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> he endea|voured to propagate this Opinion, and a Practice agreable to it. But all that ever I have &s;aid about it, has been only as expre&s;&s;ing <HI>my Opinion;</HI> and <HI>not any declared De&s;ign</HI> of Mr. <HI>Whitefield.</HI> You are expre&s;s in it, that I &s;aid that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> not only &s;pake to me of bringing over Mini&s;ters from <HI>England,</HI> but
<PB N="6" REF="005581_0006_1018AFA086495C18">
al&s;o from <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> which is peculiarly wonderful to me: For I not only, <HI>never heard Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>&s;ay any Thing of bringing Mini&s;ters into</HI> America <HI>from tho&s;e Countries la&s;t mentioned, and from neither of the Countries into</HI> NEW-ENGLAND: But I had never heard, at that Time when Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> was here, of his having any Followers in <HI>tho&s;e Countries;</HI> and I &s;uppo&s;e he had none: The won|derful Work that has been in <HI>Scotland</HI> has been all <HI>&s;ince,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s De&s;ign of going to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> was I &s;uppo&s;e form'd afterwards: Some Things that he told me of his De&s;igns, &s;eem'd incon&s;i&s;tent with his having formed the De&s;ign thon. But the mo&s;t amazing of all is, that <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;hould be men|tion'd as one of the Countries from whence Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> would &s;upply <HI>New-England</HI> with Mini|&s;ters. If I had ever heard any &s;uch Thing from Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> doubtle&s;s I &s;hould have remember'd it; for I &s;hould have looked upon it very &s;trange; hav|ing never heard of any Thing like a Revival of Re|ligion, of late in <HI>Ireland;</HI> or any Intere&s;t that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had there; or any Expectations he had from thence. <HI>I don't know that Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>ever &s;o much as mention'd the</HI> NAME <HI>of</HI> THAT LAND <HI>to me.</HI> You &s;ay that I told you, "That I took all Opportunities to talk with Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> alone about this Matter&punc; But when Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> &s;aw that I did not approve of his De&s;ign <HI>in that Matter,</HI> he did not &s;eem to chu&s;e to &s;ay any Thing about it; he would either turn off the Di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;ome|thing el&s;e, or go out of the Room." <HI>This Account is amazing to me: It is all of it perfectly new to me.</HI> Nor can I conceive what any Imagination, that ever
<PB N="7" REF="005581_0007_1018AFFD308E2530">
I &s;aid any &s;uch Things, &s;hould ari&s;e from. I indeed have told &s;everal Per&s;ons, that I once purpo&s;ely took an Opportunity to talk with Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> alone about <HI>Impul&s;es:</HI> and have mention'd many Particu|lars of our Conference together, on that Head: That I told him &s;ome Rea&s;ons I had to think he gave too great Heed to &s;uch Things: and have told what Manner of Replies he made; and what Rea&s;ons I offered again&s;t &s;uch Things. And I al&s;o &s;aid that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> did not &s;eem to be offended with me: but yet did not &s;eem to be inclined to have a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e about it: And that in the Time of it he did not appear to be convinced by any Thing&punc; I &s;aid. I have al&s;o &s;aid that I at that Time talked with Mr. <HI>Barber</HI> (who came to my Hou&s;e with Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>) about &s;ome of his <HI>Impul&s;es;</HI> dealing plainly with him; whereby he &s;eem'd to be di&s;|plea&s;ed, and replied with Earne&s;tne&s;s and Zeal. It is al&s;o true (tho' I don't know that ever I &s;pake of it before) that I thought Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> liked me not &s;o well, for my oppo&s;ing <HI>the&s;e Things.</HI> And tho' he treated me with great Kindne&s;s; yet he never made &s;o much of an Intimate of me, as of &s;ome others. It is al&s;o true, that I once talked with Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> (tho' not alone) about <HI>judging other Per&s;ons to be unconverted.</HI> But <HI>that I took all Opportunities to talk with him, about a De&s;ign of his, of turning out the Generality of the Mini&s;ters of</HI> New-England, <HI>or</HI> any Mini&s;ters; <HI>or that I took any one Opportunity to talk with him about it; or that I ever &s;aid a Word to him, or he to me, either alone, or with others, about</HI> any &s;uch De&s;ign; <HI>or that I took many Opportunities to talk with him about any of his Errors,</HI> (as your Expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems
<PB N="8" REF="005581_0008_1018AFA5FB3BA688">
to imply) <HI>or that he ever went out of the Room when I was talking with him about any of his Errors, &s;o put|ting an End to, or avoiding the Di&s;cour&s;e; or that be ever turned off &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e to any Thing el&s;e;</HI> I SAY THESE THINGS ARE NOT TRUE. And if I ever told you any &s;uch Things as the&s;e when we were riding through <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> or at any other Time, I was be&s;ide my &s;elf and knew nothing what I &s;aid; or el&s;e I am be&s;ide my &s;elf now, and have had &s;ome &s;trange &s;upernatural Change pa&s;&s;ed upon me, &s;o ob|literating my own Ideas, and all Memory of mo&s;t remarkable Things that formerly I knew, and re|member'd for a long Time, &s;o as to give a particu|lar Account of 'em to you; that they are to me as if they never had been. <HI>I do &s;olemnly declare in the Fear of</HI> GOD, <HI>that I han't the lea&s;t Trace or Foot&s;tep of any one of the&s;e Things in my Memory, either as true in Fact, or &s;poken by me.</HI> And dear <HI>Sir,</HI> if <HI>the&s;e re|markable Things</HI> are true, is it not &s;trange that I &s;hould keep the&s;e great Secrets &s;hut up in my own Brea&s;t, from all Mankind, to reveal 'em to <HI>you only;</HI> that when I knew <HI>&s;uch remarkable Things</HI> of one &s;o famous as Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and &s;o much the Subject of Con|ver&s;ation thro' <HI>New-England,</HI> I &s;hould make <HI>you, above all the World, my Confident,</HI> to declare them &s;o freely to you, after I had kept them &s;ecret for <HI>two or three Years.</HI> If I had mention'd <HI>&s;uch remarkable Things</HI> to any other, it could not but be much taken Notice of by them: and it would doubtle&s;s have been talked of by &s;ome-body el&s;e be&s;ides you. <HI>The&s;e Things are all new to my neare&s;t Friends; they never heard of any of them, 'till they heard of them as coming from you.</HI> And I am willing that all my Acquain|tance,

<P>The&s;e <HI>Sir,</HI> are the Letters that Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> mentions, and cites, in what he has lately publi&s;hed about this Affair. The&s;e are &s;ome of <HI>the Letters that have pa&s;&s;ed between us,</HI> (and tho&s;e of 'em which he cites as mo&s;t to his Purpo&s;e) <HI>con&s;idering which,</HI> he tells the World, that <HI>it was very unexpected to him, to hear that I &s;hould write a Letter to</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>to be printed, wherein there is a De|nial of &s;ome Things which he had reported:</HI> in&s;inuating to the World, that in the&s;e Letters, I had in Effect

own'd all. Whereas it appears that I have own'd no Part of his Report, but have mo&s;t &s;olemnly deny'd every Article of it. The&s;e are the individual Letters, of which he &s;ays expre&s;ly, that in <HI>the&s;e Letters; tho' I have not u&s;ed exactly the &s;ame Terms with him; yet I have u&s;ed a Variety of tho&s;e which are equally full and &s;trong: And if we &s;till differ, it is only about &s;ome particular Terms, and incon&s;iderable Circum&s;tantials, which are not worthy of any Di&s;pute.</HI> The&s;e are the Letters in which Mr. <HI>Clap&punc;</HI> plainly in&s;inuates, that I in a Manner had conceded to all that he had reported, <HI>by &s;undry fair and ingenuous Conce&s;&s;ions to him,</HI> as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf; &s;lightly adding the&s;e Words, <HI>Indeed Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>&s;eems not willing to allow that he mention'd</HI> Ireland; <HI>becau&s;e he never heard of any Intere&s;t Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>had there</HI> &amp;c.

And I am willing to leave it with you, and every one that plea&s;es, to judge how full his Paper is of Artifices, intirely to mi&s;lead the Minds of his Readers, as to their Conception of the whole Import and Drift of the&s;e Letters; not only in what has been mention'd, but in his Manner of introducing and intermingling broken Scraps of the&s;e Letters, and his Manner of joining together di&s;tant Sentences, and broken Pieces of Sentences, (that have no Connection in the Letters them&s;elves) as tho' they were a conti|nued Di&s;cour&s;e, and his Manner of di&s;canting on them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005581_0012_1018AFA7C46D2DC0">
I am willing that every Reader, who has read his Pa|per, &s;hould judge for him&s;elf, whether in reading it his own Mind was not lead to conceive of the&s;e Letters, as Things extremely diver&s;e from what he finds them to be. Doubtle&s;s Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> tru&s;ted to it, that I had kept no Copies of my Letters; otherwi&s;e he would never have &s;o exceedingly expo&s;ed him&s;elf: I am willing that you and others &s;hould judge for them&s;elves, how far, one who&s;e Con&s;cience will not re&s;train him from mak|ing &s;uch Repre&s;entations of Letters written, that he may de&s;troy others Characters, and render 'em odious to the World, is capable of unfair dealing in repre&s;enting pri|vate Conver&s;ation; where there are no Witne&s;&s;es, or written Words, that can be produced to confute him. And who can be &s;afe in human Society, if &s;uch Liber|ties are taken, in order to ruin their Fellow-Creatures and Brethren, by Gentlemen from whom &s;o different Things might be expected? If it had been true, that I had &s;aid ju&s;t as Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> has reported, yet how vehe|mently has that Practice been cried out of, by Gentle|men on that Side of the Controver&s;ies of the pre&s;ent Day, of publickly making U&s;e of private Conver&s;ation, and the Report of &s;ingle Per&s;ons, to de&s;troy the Characters of others? And e&s;pecially how ill does this become Rector <HI>Clap,</HI> after he knows that that &s;ingle Per&s;on that he &s;ays thus reported to him, does &s;o &s;trongly and &s;o|lemnly deny it, intreating of him therefore to forbear? What a Treatment is this of Chri&s;tian Brethren!&mdash;This dear <HI>Sir,</HI> is a Specimen of the Manner and Spirit, in which the Controver&s;ies of the pre&s;ent Day are carried on again&s;t Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> by many Per&s;ons (for I am far from thus charging all his Oppo&s;ers) the Per&s;ons frequently hiding them&s;elves, &amp; concealing their Names.

And tho' I think it but to little Purpo&s;e, to carry on a Controver&s;y with the&s;e Per&s;ons from the Pre&s;s, unle&s;s when forced to it by gro&s;s Slanders; yet I can't but &s;ay on this Occa&s;ion, that it &s;eems to me worthy greatly to be lamented, by all true Lovers of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which con&s;i&s;ts &s;o much in Love &amp; Forgivene&s;s, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> &s;hould be pur&s;ued with &s;o much Violence, and Appearance of inveterate Oppo&s;ition, and indefatigable Endeavours to blacken him to the ut|mo&s;t; and with &s;uch Artifices, as it would be mean to u&s;e, with Re&s;pect to the ba&s;e&s;t Mi&s;creant; and that for former Errors, which are not at all to be wondred at, con&s;idering his Youth, and the Circum&s;tances of his Education &amp;c&mdash;; when there &s;eems to be &s;o little Appearance of Ob&s;tinacy and Incorrigiblene&s;s in him, and &s;o much of the contrary; and when &s;o little can be found, by his mo&s;t watchful Enemies, now, to blame him for. I think this is a proper Occa&s;ion, for the meek Followers of the Lamb of God, to lie low before God, and lament the Corruption of human Nature, and the Sin and Shame of their dear Country, and cry humbly to Chri&s;t, that he would ride forth pro&s;perou&s;ly, becau&s;e of Truth, Meekne&s;s, and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>And with Re&s;pect to the Affair that is the Subject of the preceeding Letters, doubtle&s;s &s;o great a Contra|diction between Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> and me, in &s;uch a State of Things as the Country is now in, and relating to a Per|&s;on, concerning whom the Country is &s;o much divided in their Sentiments, with Spirits &s;o deeply, and con|trarily engaged, will cau&s;e a Variety of Reflections and

Cen&s;ures; and every one will &s;ay as he is di&s;po&s;ed. However, I think my &s;elf now called openly to make this DECLARATION: <HI>That ever Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>&s;aid any Thing to me, or I to him, of any De&s;ign of his of turning out the bigger Part of the Mini&s;ters of</HI> New-England, <HI>or any where el&s;e, or ever &s;o much as hinted, either he or any of his Company, any Thing of that Nature; or of his bringing over any Mini&s;ter, or Candidate for the Mini&s;try, from</HI> Scotland, <HI>or</HI> Ireland, <HI>into any Part of</HI> America, <HI>or from any one Country in</HI> Europe, <HI>into</HI> New-England; <HI>or that I ever reported any &s;uch Thing to Mr.</HI> Clap, <HI>or any other Per&s;on, or that ever any Thought of Mr.</HI> Whitefield's <HI>&s;aying, or hinting, any Thing like either of the&s;e Things, ever entred into my Heart, 'till I heard 'em as coming from Mr.</HI> Clap; <HI>or that Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>ever intimated to me, any De&s;ign of his going to</HI> Scotland, <HI>or making any Intere&s;t there; or that he ever mention'd the Name of</HI> Ireland <HI>in my bear|ing;</HI> I &s;ay that any of the&s;e Things ever were, I have no Remembrance: <HI>God is my Witne&s;s who &s;earches my Heart, and will bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkne&s;s, and make manife&s;t the Coun&s;els of the Heart.</HI> And whether it be probable that I &s;hould wholly forget all the&s;e Things, if they indeed had been; e&s;pecially tho&s;e remarkable, great Things, that Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> has reported that I &s;aid, after I had well remembred them for two Years and an half, &s;o as to give Him a di&s;tinct Account of them, I leave others to judge. And whether I have a Con&s;cience &s;ufficient to re&s;train me from Lying with this Solemnity or no; yet, I mu&s;t al&s;o leave it to others to judge, whether it be likely that when I had &s;o grand a Secret committed to me, of a Scheme to bring about

&s;o great a Revolution, as the turning out mo&s;t of the Mini&s;ters in the Country, and bringing over four or five Hundred from <HI>Europe,</HI> to &s;ettle in their Places, I &s;hould carefully keep it &s;ecret from every Mortal for two or three Years, and declare it freely to Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> and never to any other Per&s;on before or &s;ince. For I now publickly Challenge the whole World be&s;ides Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> to declare, if they ever heard me report any &s;uch Thing.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> &s;ays, he and I well agreed to condemn many Errors &amp;c.&mdash;: That might be; for all the Land knows that I ever condemned many Errors. But there was little in our Conver&s;ation, in the Journey Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> &s;peaks of, to draw me to &s;uch a Confidence in him, as to choo&s;e him above all the World, to reveal my great|e&s;t Secrets to: For he immediately fell upon me, as he knows, as &s;oon as ever we began to ride the Road to|gether, about &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in my Book, concerning the Revival of Religion, greatly blaming me, earne&s;tly di&s;puting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uppo&s;e, for Hours together.

<P>Thus dear <HI>Sir,</HI> I have endeavoured to &s;et forth this latter as it is&punc; Publick Controver&s;y from the Pre&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;pecially publick Contradiction, is not, for it's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> de&s;ireable, but much otherwi&s;e; and is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> a great Aver&s;ion to.
