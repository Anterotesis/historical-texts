<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE human body is certainly one of the mo&s;t &s;tupendous works of Omnipotence. Ana|tomy di&s;covers in it ten thou|&s;and marks of wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s, which I have no room to mention here; nor indeed is it po&s;&s;ible for any finite intelli|gence to de&s;cribe the geometri|cal accuracy with which the Author of nature has formed every part of the fabric. How|ever, as I &s;incerely wi&s;h that all who are honored with the&s;e cu|rious and wonderfully wrought bodies, may po&s;&s;e&s;s them in health and happine&s;s, and, as
<PB N="iv" REF="025349_0003_0FCD0165C6C65060">
long experience demon&s;trates, that this can not be attained without TEMPERANCE and EX|ERCISE, I &s;hall in this paper give the reader &s;uch a view of the &s;tructure and mechani&s;m of his own frame, as will convince him of the nece&s;&s;ity and import|ance of tho&s;e virtues.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the body as a &s;y&s;|tem of tubes and glands, or, (in a more ru&s;tic phra&s;e) a large bundle of pipes and &s;trainers; every part of the body, all the bowels, mu&s;cles, tendons and ligaments, are compo&s;ed by a conjunction of countle&s;s num|bers of the&s;e pipes and &s;train|ers, that is, of arteries, veins, nerves and glands. The&s;e in|numerable ve&s;&s;els, di&s;po&s;ed in proper order, and filled with
<PB N="vii" REF="025349_0004_0FCD01673A4A93B0">
&s;uitable fluids or juices, are, by divine appointment, to main|tain, while life la&s;ts, a continu|al action and motion.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach and bowels are continually labouring to dige&s;t, that is, to grind and reduce the food into a kind of milk, call|ed chyle; this, carried by mil|lions of little pipes into the blood-ve&s;&s;els, is there, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ncea&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tion of the heart and arteries, converted into blood, and circulated through|out all parts of the body, to re|pair the con&s;tantly wearing &s;o|lids, to recruit the ever wa&s;ting fluids, and to furni&s;h a &s;ea&s;on|able and friendly &s;upply to the cea&s;ele&s;s con&s;umption of nature.</P>
<P>From this &s;ketch of the body and its laws, it plainly appears,
<PB N="iv" REF="025349_0005_0FCD016921CC1598">
that two things are principally e&s;&s;ential to good health&mdash;Suf|ficient &s;trength of the ve&s;&s;els&mdash;and a free circulation of the fluids.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t have &s;trength &s;ufficient to convert the food into whole&s;ome blood and urge it on with vigour; and the blood mu&s;t have a proper con&s;i&s;tence to yield to the action of the ve&s;&s;els and circulate freely. To pre&s;erve the body in this natu|ral and healthy &s;tate, is an im|portant ta&s;k indeed, and which Infinite Wi&s;dom has con&s;igned chiefly to temperance and ex|erci&s;e. The one, allows us to take &s;uch food only as is whole|&s;ome and &s;uffici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;upply the demands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ure; the other gives &s;uch firmne&s;s to the
<PB N="vii" REF="025349_0006_0FCD016B56D99818">
fibres as to enable them to di|ge&s;t and change the food into fit nouri&s;hment, and convey it to the different parts. And though the component parts of our bodies are &s;o inconceivably numerous and complicated; though they are &s;o very minute and delicate, yet &s;o wonderful is the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD in the di&s;po&s;ition of them, that they would &s;eldom or never be di&s;ordered, were we but duly temperate and laborious. And without a proper regard to tho&s;e great duties, the mo&s;t &s;overeign medicines in nature will not have virtue &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve us long in health. There is an anecdote related by &s;ome of the oriental writers, which places the importance of exerci&s;e in a
<PB N="viii" REF="025349_0007_0FCD016C80ADA138">
proper point of view. A king who had long langui&s;hed under an ill habit of body, and had taken abundance of medicines to no purpo&s;e, was at length cured by the following method. His phy&s;ician took an hollow ball of wood and filled it with drugs, after which he clo&s;ed it up &s;o artfully that nothing ap|peared. He likewi&s;e took a mall, and having hollowed it, he inclo&s;ed in it &s;everal drugs after the &s;ame manner as in the ball it&s;elf. He then ordered the king to exerci&s;e him&s;elf eve|ry morning with the&s;e in&s;tru|ments, till he &s;hould get into a moderate per&s;piration; when as the &s;tory goes, the virtue of the medicaments per&s;piring thro' the wood, had &s;o good an influ|ence
<PB N="ix" REF="025349_0008_0FCD016E1D86C6E0">
on the king's con&s;titution, that they cured him of an indi&s;|po&s;ition which all the compo&s;i|tions he had taken inwardly had not been able to remove.</P>
<P>This allegory is finely con|trived to &s;hew us how benefi|cial bodily labour is to health, and that exerci&s;e is the be&s;t phy|&s;ic. But there is another grand pre&s;ervative of health, I mean temperance, which may be practi&s;ed by all ranks and con|ditions, at any &s;ea&s;on, or in any place, without interruption to bu&s;ine&s;s, expence of money, or lo&s;s of time. The&s;e two reme|dies, duly ob&s;erved, will for|tify the con&s;titution and render it, in &s;ome &s;ort, invulnerable. Exerci&s;e tends to throw off all &s;uperfluities, and temperance
<PB N="x" REF="025349_0009_0FCD01703B347E80">
to prevent them; exerci&s;e clears the ve&s;&s;els, temperance never over&s;trains them; exerci&s;e rolls on the vital current, temperance gives nature full play, and al|lows her to exert her&s;elf in all her force and vigour; exerci&s;e di&s;&s;ipates a growing di&s;temper, temperance &s;tarves it.</P>
<P>Phy&s;ic is hardly any thing el&s;e but the &s;ub&s;titute of tempe|rance or exerci&s;e. 'Tis indeed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome di&s;|tempers, but did men but live in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> habitual u&s;e of tho&s;e two great in&s;truments of health, there would be but little occa&s;i|on for it. Bli&s;tering, cupping and bleeding, emetics, diet-drinks and bitters, are &s;eldom of u&s;e but to the intemperate and idle, who u&s;e them in order
<PB N="xi" REF="025349_0010_0FCD0171BB6EC090">
to make their luxury con&s;i&s;tent with health. The apothecary and doctor are perpetually em|ployed in countermining the cook and di&s;tiller. It is &s;aid of Diogenes, that meeting a young man who was going to a fea&s;t, he took him up in the &s;treet, and carried him home to his friends, as one who was running into imminent danger, had not he prevented him. What would that philo&s;opher have &s;aid, had he been pre&s;ent at the gluttony of a modern meal? Would he not have thought the ma&s;ter of a family mad, had he &s;een him devour fowl, fi&s;h and fle&s;h; &s;wallow oil and vinegar, wines and &s;pices; throw down &s;allads of twenty different herbs, &s;auces of an hundred ingredients,
<PB N="xii" REF="025349_0011_0FCD017357935EB0">
confections and fruits of num|berle&s;s &s;weets and flavors? What unnatural motions and counterferments mu&s;t &s;uch a medley of intemperance produce in the body? For my part, when I behold a fa&s;hionable table &s;et out in all its magnifi|cence, I fancy that I &s;ee gouts and drop&s;ies, fevers and lethar|gies, with other innumerable di&s;tempers, lying in ambu&s;cade among the di&s;hes.</P>
<P>Were I permitted to pre|&s;cribe &s;uch a kind of temper|ance as would &s;uit all per&s;ons, I would copy the following rules of a very eminent phy|&s;ician.</P>
<P>Make your whole repa&s;t out of one di&s;h. If you indulge in a &s;econd, avoid drinking any
<PB N="xiii" REF="025349_0012_0FCD01758C5107C8">
thing &s;trong, till you have fi|ni&s;hed your meal; and ab&s;tain from all &s;auces, or at lea&s;t &s;uch as are not the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple. A man would &s;eldom be guilty of gluttony if he at|tended to the&s;e few and ea&s;y rules prudently contenting him|&s;elf with one good di&s;h, he would not be in danger of exce&s;s, like tho&s;e who indulge their craving appetites on every thing that is &s;et before them. And by ab|&s;taining from hot &s;auces, and &s;trong drinks, he would never feel tho&s;e fal&s;e appetites which often betray intemperate people to load their &s;tomachs greatly to their hurt. And &s;ince it is to be feared, that the mo&s;t tem|perate do &s;ometimes err a little on the &s;ide of exce&s;s, a man
<PB N="xiv" REF="025349_0013_0FCD0177A4FDF880">
would do well to mi&s;s a meal now and then; it would prove a great relief to nature, help her to clean&s;e and carry off her crudities, and give her time to recover the tones and &s;prings of her di&s;tended ve&s;&s;els. Be&s;ides, ab&s;tinence well timed, often kills a &s;ickne&s;s in the bud, and de&s;troys the fir&s;t &s;eeds of an in|di&s;po&s;ition. Several eminent writers of antiquity tell us, that Socrates lived in Athens all the time of that dreadful plague which &s;wept off &s;o many thou|&s;ands, and yet he never took the lea&s;t infection; which the&s;e writers unanimou&s;ly a&s;cribe to his temperate way of living.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but ob|&s;erve, that if we compare the lives of tho&s;e ancient &s;ages who
<PB N="xv" REF="025349_0014_0FCD017878A557C0">
were &s;o eminent for their tem|perance, with the lives of any &s;et of kings or great men of the &s;ame number, we &s;hould think they were of two different dates. For the generality of tho&s;e wi&s;e men were nearer an hundred than &s;ixty years of age at the time of their deaths. But the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance of the efficacy of temperance towards procuring long life, is what we meet with in a little book pub|li&s;hed by Lewis Cornaro the Ve|netian; which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he rather men|tion becau&s;e it is of undoubted credit, as the late Venetian am|ba&s;&s;ador, who was of the &s;ame family, atte&s;ted more than once in conver&s;ation when he re&s;id|ed in England. Cornaro, the author of the little treati&s;e I am
<PB N="xvi" REF="025349_0015_0FCD0179F4EC7640">
mentioning was of an infirm con&s;titution till about forty, when by ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in an exact cour&s;e of temper|ance, he recovered a perfect &s;tate of health, in&s;omuch that at four&s;core he publi&s;hed his book, which has been tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, under the title of <Q><HI>Sure and certain methods of at|taining a long and healthy life.</HI></Q> He lived to give a third or fourth edition of it; and af|ter having pa&s;&s;ed his hundredth year, died without pain or ago|ny, like one who falls a&s;leep. The treati&s;e I mention has been taken notice of by &s;everal emi|nent authors, and is written with &s;uch a &s;pirit of chearful|ne&s;s, religion, and good &s;en&s;e, as are the natural concomitants
<PB N="xvii" REF="025349_0016_0FCD017BE1F9D870">
of temperance and &s;obriety. The mixture of the old man in it, is rather a recommendation than a di&s;credit to it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved that cu&s;|tom has lately introduced into Italy, two very dangerous evils&mdash;FLATTERY and INTEMPE|RANCE.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e bani&s;hes from conver&s;ation, all frank|ne&s;s and plain dealing. And a|gain&s;t the latter I declare open

war, as being the mo&s;t fatal e|nemy of our health.</P>
<P>'Tis an unhappine&s;s into which the people of this age are fallen, that variety of di&s;hes is become fa&s;hionable and too generally preferred to frugality. And yet the one is the offspring of divine temperance; whil&s;t pride and gluttony are the odi|ous parents of the other. Not|with&s;tanding the difference of their origin, yet prodigality is now a-days tricked up in the pompous titles of magnificence, genero&s;ity and grandeur; whil&s;t ble&s;t frugality is too often brand|ed as the badge of an avaricious and &s;ordid &s;pirit.</P>
<P>This error has &s;o far &s;educed us, as to prevail on many to re|nounce a frugal way of living,
<PB N="21" REF="025349_0019_0FCD0183E0311AA8">
though taught by nature, from the earlie&s;t ages of the world; and has betrayed us into tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which &s;erve only to a|bridge the number of our days. We are grown old before we have been able to ta&s;te the plea|&s;ures of being young. And the time which ought to be the &s;ummer of our lives is often the beginning of their winter. We &s;oon perceive our &s;trength to fail, and weakne&s;s to come on, long before we have attain|ed to the perfection of our na|ture. On the contrary, tem|perance promotes and pre&s;erves to us the full perfection of our natures. Our youth is la&s;ting, and our manhood attended with a vigor that does not begin to decay till after a great many
<PB N="22" REF="025349_0020_0FCD0185AFD623B8">
years. This is &s;o true, that when men were not addicted to intemperance they had more &s;trength and vivacity at four|&s;core, than we have at forty.</P>
<P>Oh unhappy Italy! doe&s;t thou not &s;ee, that gluttony and ex|ce&s;s rob thee, every year, of more inhabitants than pe&s;tilence, war, and famine could have done? Thy true plagues, are thy numerous luxuries and im|moderate fea&s;tings, in which thy deluded citizens indulge them&s;elves to an exce&s;s unwor|thy of the rational character and utterly ruinous to their health; for how is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;upport nature under &s;uch loads of con|trary and unwhole&s;ome foods? Put a &s;top to this fatal abu&s;e, for God's &s;ake, for there is not,
<PB N="23" REF="025349_0021_0FCD01883835D4E0">
I am certain of it, a vice more abominable in the eyes of the divine Maje&s;ty, nor any more de&s;tructive. How many have I &s;een cut off, in the flower of their days by this unhappy cu&s;|tom of high feeding! How many excellent friends has glut|tony deprived me of, who, but for this accur&s;ed vice, might have been an ornament to the world, an honour to their coun|try, and have afforded me as much joy in their lives, as I now feel concern at their lo&s;s!</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to put a &s;top to &s;o great an evil, I have undertaken this little book, and I attempt it the more readily, as many young gentlemen have re|que&s;ted it of me, moved there|to by &s;eeing their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">hers drop
<PB N="24" REF="025349_0022_0FCD018B5E013A88">
off in the flower of their youth, and me &s;o &s;ound and hearty at the age of eighty-one. They begged me to let them know by what means I attained to &s;uch excellent health and &s;pirits at my time of life. I could not but think their curio&s;ity very laudable, and was willing to gratify them, and at the &s;ame time do &s;ome &s;ervice to my countrymen, by declaring, in the fir&s;t place, what led me to renounce intemperance and lead a temperate life; &s;econdly, by &s;hewing the rules I ob&s;erved; and thirdly, what un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction and advantage I de|rived from it; whence it may be very clearly &s;een how ea&s;y a thing it is for a wi&s;e man to e|&s;cape all the cur&s;es of intem|perance,
<PB N="25" REF="025349_0023_0FCD018E0A73FEB0">
and &s;ecure to him&s;elf the ine&s;timable felicities of vi|gorous health and chearful age.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that led me to embrace a temperate life, was, the many and &s;ore evils which I &s;uffered from the contrary cour&s;e of living; my con&s;titu|tion was, naturally, weakly and delicate, which ought in rea&s;on to have made me more regular and prudent, but being, like mo&s;t young men, too fond of what is u&s;ually called good eat|ing and drinking, I gave the rein to my appetites. In a little time I began to feel the ill ef|fects of &s;uch intemperance; for I had &s;carce attained to my thir|ty-fifth year, before I was at|tacked with a complication of di&s;orders, &s;uch as, head-achs, a
<PB N="26" REF="025349_0024_0FCD019008E48128">
&s;ick &s;tomach, cholicky unea&s;i|ne&s;&s;es, the gout, rheumatic pains, lingering fevers, and continual thir&s;t; and though I was then but in the middle of my days, my con&s;titution &s;eemed &s;o en|tirely ruined that I could hard|ly hope for any other termina|tion to my &s;ufferings but death.</P>
<P>The be&s;t phy&s;icians in Italy employed all their &s;kill in my behalf, but to no effect. At la&s;t they told me, very candid|ly, that there was but one thing that could afford me a &s;ingle ray of hope, but one medicine that could give a radical cure; viz. the immediate adoption of a temperate and regular life. They added moreover, that, now, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no time to lo&s;e, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> immediately, either
<PB N="27" REF="025349_0025_0FCD0191498996E0">
chu&s;e a regimen or death, and that if I deferred their advice much longer, it would be too late for ever to do it. This was a home thru&s;t. I could not bear the thoughts of dying &s;o &s;oon, and being convinced of their a|bilities and experience, I thought the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e I could take, would be to follow their advice, how di&s;agreeable &s;oever it might &s;eem.</P>
<P>I then reque&s;ted my phy&s;i|cians to tell me exactly after what manner I ought to govern my&s;elf? To this they replied, that I &s;hould always con&s;ider my&s;elf as an infirm per&s;on; eat nothing but what agreed with me, and that in &s;mall quantity. I then immediately entered on this new cour&s;e of life, and
<PB N="28" REF="025349_0026_0FCD0192C5581A60">
with &s;o determined a re&s;olution, that nothing has been &s;ince able to divert me from it. In a few days I perceived that this new way of living agreed very well with me; and in le&s;s than a twelve month I had the un|&s;peakable happine&s;s to find that all my late alarming &s;ymptoms were vani&s;hed, and that I was perfectly re&s;tored to health.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had I began to ta&s;te the &s;weets of this new re&s;urrec|tion, but I made many very plea&s;ing reflections on the great advantages of temperance, and thought within my&s;elf, <Q>if this virtue has had &s;o divine an efficacy, as to cure me of &s;uch grievous di&s;orders, &s;urely i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> will help my bad con&s;tituti|on and confirm my health.</Q>
<PB N="29" REF="025349_0027_0FCD0195222BC5B0">
I therefore applied my&s;elf dili|gently to di&s;cover what kinds of food were propere&s;t for me. I re&s;olved to try whether tho&s;e di&s;hes that plea&s;ed my ta&s;te, were friendly or hurtful to my health, and whether the pro|verb be true, which &s;ays, <HI>that what delights the palate mu&s;t be good for the &s;tomach.</HI> I found it to be fal&s;e; and that it ju&s;t &s;erves as an excu&s;e to gluttons who are for indulging them|&s;elves in whatever plea&s;es their appetites.</P>
<P>I therefore took no more no|tice of the proverb, but made choice of &s;uch meats and drinks as agreed with my con&s;titution, and made it an inviolable law with my&s;elf, <HI>always to ri&s;e with an appetite to eat more if I</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="025349_0028_0FCD0197A3054560">
<HI>plea&s;ed.</HI> In a word, I entirely renounced intemperance, and made a vow to continue the re|mainder of my life under the &s;ame regimen I had ob&s;erved: A happy re&s;olution this! the keeping of which entirely cured me of all my infirmities. I ne|ver before lived a year together, without falling once at lea&s;t, in|to &s;ome violent illne&s;s&punc; but this never happened to me after|wards; on the contrary. I have always been healthy ever &s;ince I was temperate.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget here to men|tion a circum&s;tance of con&s;ider|able con&s;equence. I have been telling of a great, and to me, a mo&s;t happy change in my way of living. Now all changes, though from the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> to the <HI>be&s;t</HI>

<P>About five years ago&punc; I was over-per&s;uaded to a thing, which had like to have co&s;t me dear. My relations, whom I love, and who have a real tenderne&s;s for me; my friends, with whom I was willing to comply in any thing that was rea&s;onable; la&s;t|ly, my phy&s;icians, who were looked upon as the oracles of health, did all agree, that I eat too little; that the nouri&s;hment I took was not &s;ufficient for one of my years; that I ought not only to &s;upport nature, but like|wi&s;e to increa&s;e the vigor of it, by eating a little more than I
<PB N="43" REF="025349_0041_0FCD01AE7980EE98">
did. It was in vain for me to repre&s;ent to them, that nature is content with a little; that with this little I had enjoyed excellent health &s;o many years; that to me the habit of it was become a &s;econd nature; and that it was more agreeable to rea&s;on, that as I advanced in years and lo&s;t my &s;trength, I &s;hould rather <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> than <HI>increa&s;e</HI> the quantity of my food, e&s;peci|ally as the powers of the &s;tomach mu&s;t grow weaker from year to year. To &s;trengthen my ar|guments, I urged tho&s;e two na|tural and true proverbs; one, that he who would eat a great deal mu&s;t eat but little; that is, eating little makes a man live long, and living long he mu&s;t eat a great deal. The other
<PB N="44" REF="025349_0042_0FCD01B0887D8DB0">
proverb was, that what we leave, after making a hearty meal, does us more good than what we have eaten. But neither my pro|verbs nor arguments could &s;i|lence their affectionate intrea|ties. Wherefore to plea&s;e per|&s;ons who were &s;o dear to me, I con&s;ented to increa&s;e the quan|tity of food, but with two oun|ces only. So that, as before I had always taken but twelve ounces of &s;olid food in the day, I now increa&s;ed it to fourteen, and as before I drank but four|teen ounces of wine in the day, I now increa&s;ed it to &s;ixteen. This increa&s;e had in eight days time &s;uch an effect on me, that from being remarkably chearful and bri&s;k, I began to be peevi&s;h and melancholy, and was con|&s;tantly

&s;o &s;trangely di&s;po&s;ed, that I neither knew what to &s;ay to others, nor what to do with my&s;elf.

However, GOD be prai&s;ed, I recovered, though in my &s;eventy eighth year, and in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on of a very cold winter, and reduced to a mere &s;keleton, and I am po&s;itive, that, next to GOD, I am mo&s;t indebt|ed to temperance, for my reco|very.

Hence it is, that when a di&s;intere&s;ted phy&s;ician vi&s;its a patient, the fir&s;t thing he pre&s;cribes, is to live regularly. And when he takes leave of his patient after recovery, he advi&s;es him, as he tenders his health, to lead a re|gular life. And were a patient,

<P>You will tell me that <HI>Plato,</HI> as &s;ober a man as he was, yet affirmed, that it is difficult for a man in public life to live &s;o temperately, being often in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, expo&s;ed to the badne&s;s of weather, to the
<PB N="54" REF="025349_0052_0FCD01C2ED6BCEC0">
fatigues of travelling, and to eat whatever he can meet with. This cannot be denied; but then I maintain, that the&s;e things will never ha&s;ten a man's death, provided he accu&s;toms him&s;elf to a frugal way of living. There is no man, in what condition &s;oever but may keep from over|eating; and thereby happily prevent tho&s;e di&s;tempers that are cau&s;ed by exce&s;s. They who have the charge of public affairs committed to their tru&s;t, are more obliged to it than any others: where there is no glory to be got for their country, they ought not to &s;acrifice them&s;elves: they &s;hould pre&s;erve them&s;elves to &s;erve it; and if they pur&s;ue my method, it is certain they would ward off the di&s;tempers

which heat and cold and fatigues might bring upon them; or &s;hould they be di&s;turbed with them it would be but very light|ly.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be objected, that if one who is well, is diet|ed like one that is &s;ick, he will be at a lo&s;s about the choice of his diet, when any di&s;temper comes upon him.

<P>OF all the people on the face of the earth&punc; the A|mericans are under the greate&s;t obligations to live temperately. Formed for commerce, our coun|try abounds with bays, rivers, and creeks, the exhalations from which, give the air a dampne&s;s unfriendly to the &s;prings of life.

This precaution, at all times nece&s;&s;ary, is peculiar|ly &s;o in autumn, for then the body is relaxed by the inten&s;e heat of the dog-days, the air is filled with noxious vapours from putrid vegetables; Nature her|&s;elf wears a &s;ickly drooping a&s;pect; the mo&s;t robu&s;t feel a di&s;agreeable wearine&s;s and &s;ore|ne&s;s of their fle&s;h, a heavine&s;s and &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s in motion, quick feveri&s;h flu&s;hings, and &s;udden chills darting along their nerves, (all plain proofs of a &s;ickly atmo&s;phere, and tottering health.) Now, if ever we need the aid of all-invigorating tem|perance, now keep the &s;to|mach light and vigorous by mo|derate feeding, the veins well &s;tored with healthy blood, and
