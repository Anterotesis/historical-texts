<BIBL><HI>AMOS,</HI> III. 2.</BIBL>
<Q>YOU ONLY HAVE I KNOWN OF ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH, THEREFORE I WILL PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR INIQUITIES.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE prophet was directed to &s;peak in the name of the Lord, to the children of I&s;rael, &mdash;
<Q>You only have I known, of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puni&s;h you for your iniquities.</Q></P>
<P>IN as much as
<Q>the things which were written aforetime were written for our learning,</Q>
it may be a proper and u&s;eful exerci&s;e for us, on the pre&s;ent &s;erious occa&s;ion, to con&s;ider &s;ome of the rea&s;ons, why tho&s;e &s;ubjects of moral government, who have received particular favours, and have
<PB N="4" REF="033984_0003_0FF9EEFCB0917CA8">abu&s;ed them, have been marked out, in divine providence, by particular puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>GREAT caution however is to be u&s;ed, in mak|ing up our judgment, with re&s;pect to individuals, or &s;ocieties of men, from the &s;ufferings of the pre&s;ent life.</P>
<P>THE friends of Job, we find had embraced an opinion, at that age of the world, that the greate&s;t &s;ufferers, are the greate&s;t &s;inners. This al&s;o was the opinion of the Jews, who &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e un|happy per&s;ons, who were de&s;troyed by a tower in Siloam, which fell upon them, were the greate&s;t &s;inners in Jeru&s;alem. But this opinion, however popular, was di&s;countenanced and rejected by the great teacher of mankind. He exhorted all who heard him to repent, as they hoped to e&s;cape de&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT while we u&s;e great caution, in making up our judgment with re&s;pect to individuals, or &s;ocie|ties of men, from their circum&s;tances in the pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, we have authority from the &s;criptures to &s;ay, that individuals, and nations of men, have been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> on account of their virtues, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of their vices. While the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> world, is to be con&s;idered, as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> government by the ope|ration
<PB N="5" REF="033984_0004_0FF9C71A0A014398">of laws which he hath e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;o that in a general way, neither love or hatred can be known by the circum&s;tances of the children of men, it mu&s;t be granted, that obedient &s;ubjects, have, in many in&s;tances, been encouraged by re|wards, while ob&s;tinate and rebellious &s;inners, have been puni&s;hed for their crimes.</P>
<P>HAVING made the foregoing ob&s;ervations, I will proceed to offer &s;ome rea&s;ons <HI>why</HI> tho&s;e &s;ub|jects of moral government, who have received particular favours and have abu&s;ed them, have been marked out in divine providence, by particu|lar puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>AND I&s;t. The honor of divine government may require, that &s;ingular puni&s;hments, under certain circum&s;tances, &s;hould be inflicted, even in the pre|&s;ent life.</P>
<P>ONE rea&s;on, and perhaps, the greate&s;t of all, why the children of I&s;rael were delivered from the bondage of Egypt, with a high hand, and con|ducted through the &s;ea, and through the wilder|ne&s;s with an out-&s;tretched arm, was to &s;how the heathen nations, in a &s;trong and convincing light, that Jehovah is infinitely &s;uperior to all who were called Gods, and that He alone is to be wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P>GOD knew I&s;rael as his peculiar people. He declared him&s;elf, the God of Abraham, the God
<PB N="6" REF="033984_0005_0FF9EF065B317CA0">of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob. Having made a &s;olemn covenant with tho&s;e patriarchs and their children, and granted them many important fa|vours; having revealed to them his will, and given them commandments and ordinances to ob&s;erve, his honour, as the Governor of the world, was con|nected with their conduct.</P>
<P>WHEN it was known among the heathen, that God &s;ent plagues on the Egyptians, becau&s;e their King refu&s;ed to relea&s;e the &s;eed of Jacob from un|rea&s;onable &s;ervitude;&mdash;that he de&s;troyed Pharaoh and his ho&s;t in the red &s;ea;&mdash;that he &s;ettled his redeemed people in a country which had been long promi&s;ed them, and protected them when expo&s;ed to the numerous and powerful enemies round about them, there were particular and very &s;trong rea&s;ons why they &s;hould be careful to obey all the commandments which the Lord their God had given them. When they di&s;covered their ingratitude by forgetting their deliverer, and by practi&s;ing tho&s;e things which had been &s;trictly forbidden, there were particular and &s;trong rea|&s;ons why they &s;hould be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE prophets and mini&s;ters of the mo&s;t High, were careful to proclaim abroad, that God had cho&s;en I&s;rael to be his inheritance,&mdash;a people to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e: and therefore when I&s;rael
<PB N="7" REF="033984_0006_0FF9EF07E1BF5FB0">cho&s;e to be the inheritance of others, and to &s;hew forth the prai&s;e of &s;trange Gods, the honour of Jehovah required, that I&s;rael &s;hould be puni&s;hed. The &s;in of for&s;aking the true God, and giving that wor&s;hip to idols which is due to Jehovah, was a public &s;in; it was therefore highly proper, that &s;ome puni&s;hments of a public nature &s;hould be inflicted.</P>
<P>THE propriety of inflicting particular puni&s;h|ments on the children of I&s;rael, after they had abu&s;ed the &s;ingular favours which had been con|ferred upon them, will farther appear, when we con&s;ider they were threatened with di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cala|mities, in order to guard them again&s;t apo&s;tacy and rebellion.</P>
<P>WITHOUT con&s;ulting any other parts of the &s;acred volume, the xxviiith chapter of the book of Deuteronomy will furni&s;h &s;ufficient evidence of the care which Jehovah exerci&s;ed over the morals of his ancient covenant people, both by promi&s;ing ble&s;&s;ings to the obedient, and threatening puni&s;h|ments, varying in degree, but dreadful in the end, on all &s;uch as re&s;olved to do wickedly.</P>
<P>WE go on to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">IIdly. ANOTHER rea&s;on why &s;ingular puni&s;h|ments are inflicted on &s;uch members of God's
<PB N="8" REF="033984_0007_0FF9EF0FACD98970">moral government, as have received particular favours and have abu&s;ed them, may be to pro|mote the reformation and real good of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN order to qualify imperfect creatures for ad|vancement in happine&s;s, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, that in &s;ome &s;tage of their exi&s;tence, they &s;hould be &s;ubjected to a cour&s;e of trial and di&s;cipline.&mdash; Nor are we to &s;uppo&s;e it hath been the peculiarly hard lot of mankind to be placed under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances. Beings &s;uperior to us have been tried. What were the particular circum&s;tances of trial to which the angels were &s;ubjected we know not. We know, from the &s;acred books, a number of them fell from their fir&s;t e&s;tate&mdash;
<Q>left their own habitation, and are re&s;erved in ever|la&s;ting chains, under darkne&s;s, unto the judg|ment of the great day.</Q></P>
<P>OUR parents, made in the image of God, and free from &s;in, were tried and fell. We all have our trials. We are all in a &s;tate of di&s;cipline. Some of the children of men have greater trials than others. It hath &s;o happened, that &s;ome who were under the mo&s;t favourable di&s;cipline, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t advantages for moral and religious im|provement, have been overcome in the day of trial,
<PB N="9" REF="033984_0008_0FF9EF15D008C450">and have wandered in the way of &s;in. In mercy to &s;uch per&s;ons God hath corrected them. By &s;ufferings he hath taught them the evil of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. To this point we have the te&s;timony of David, a man, in many re&s;pects, highly favoured, but extremely irregular in his conduct.
<Q>Before I was afflicted,
&s;ays, he,
I went a&s;tray: but now have I kept thy word.</Q>
Like good effects of affliction have been experienced by &s;erious peo|ple in all ages.</P>
<P>SUCH are the imperfections of human nature, and of the pre&s;ent life, that &s;mall has been the number of tho&s;e who have maintained purity of moral cha|racter, and a truly devotional &s;pirit, during a cour&s;e of uninterrupted pro&s;perity, and worldly enjoyment. When <HI>Agur</HI> prayed that he might po&s;&s;e&s;s medio|crity of circum&s;tances, he knew that uninterrupted pro&s;perity very often draws off the heart from God.
<Q>Give me neither poverty nor riches: feed me with food convenient for me, le&s;t I be full and deny thee, and &s;ay, who is the Lord?</Q></P>
<P>WHEN people are drawn away from a &s;en&s;e of dependance of God, and from the path of duty, by their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and by the abundance which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, afflictions and di&s;appointments, may do them good.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="033984_0009_0FF9C72E24052930">IN the cour&s;e of di&s;cipline in which we are pla|ced, we either improve in virtue and knowledge, or we degenerate: The means which are u&s;ed with us in providence, will either have a good effect, or leave us le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of good impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THERE are tho&s;e, who by the bounties of heaven, are filled with gratitude: who &s;tudy to know what returns they &s;hall make for divine favours: who endeavour to honour God, and to make their fel|low-creatures happy, in the u&s;e which they make of their &s;ub&s;tance. Such men are good &s;tewards: they feel the plea&s;ure of doing good, and their re|ward will be great in Heaven.</P>
<P>OTHERS there are, who are proud of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s. Pro&s;perity makes them vain and &s;elfi&s;h. When they ought to be more pious, they are more irreligious: When they have more power to do good, they have le&s;s of the di&s;po&s;ition. They re|ject the &s;olicitations of the poor and needy, that they may have the more to con&s;ume in the gratifi|cation of their appetites and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>WHEN men who were once &s;ober and virtuous, who in moderate circum&s;tances, attended to the duties of religion, and felt the &s;ufferings of the needy and afflicted, lo&s;e their good impre&s;&s;ions;
<PB N="11" REF="033984_0010_0FF9EF244298AC40">and in more elevated circum&s;tances, &s;how that they regard nothing but their own plea&s;ures, it may be a mercy to correct them. When they &s;how that they cannot bear &s;ucce&s;s, but the more they have, the more they increa&s;e in pride and folly, it may be a mercy to &s;trip them of their &s;ub&s;tance, and humble them by lo&s;&s;es and &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>THAT the purpo&s;es of God are kind and bene|volent, in the &s;ufferings which he brings on the children of men, we are clearly taught in the &s;a|cred writings. He does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. If need be we are in heavine&s;s. The fruit of affliction is to take away &s;in.</P>
<P>WE add once more,</P>
<P N="3">IIIdly. GOD may inflict particular puni&s;hments on &s;uch members of his moral government, as have received particular favours, and have abu&s;ed them, in order to afford &s;uitable warning to others.</P>
<P>ONE important end for which the judgments of Heaven fell upon the di&s;obedient children of I&s;rael, was the conviction which their &s;ufferings afforded, even to the heathen nations, that the ways of God are right; and that he will not &s;uffer the workers of iniquity to e&s;cape the effects of his di&s;plea&s;ure.
<PB N="12" REF="033984_0011_0FF9C743C17B6CD0">Thus we read, in the xxxixth of Ezekiel:
<Q>The heathen &s;hall know that the hou&s;e of I&s;rael went into captivity for <HI>their iniquities</HI>:&mdash;becau&s;e they tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies.</Q></P>
<P>MORE &s;olemn warnings cannot be given to the wicked children of men, than tho&s;e which were given to the children of I&s;rael, both by the words which were &s;poken to them, and by the puni&s;h|ments which in the cour&s;e of divine providence, were inflicted upon them.</P>
<P>THEY were the peculiar people of the mo&s;t High. God cho&s;e them from the nations of the earth, that by them his name might be known, and that they might &s;hew forth his prai&s;e. He delivered them from the bondage of Egypt: He protected them when expo&s;ed to their enemies: He fed them with bread from Heaven: He e&s;ta|bli&s;hed with them his covenant: He gave them particular in&s;tructions with re&s;pect to their con|duct: He promi&s;ed them the highe&s;t temporal felicity as the reward of obedience, and threatened them with extreme wretchedne&s;s, in ca&s;e they re|jected his law, and cho&s;e to rebel again&s;t him.</P>

<P>BETWEEN eight and nine hundred years after|ter the date of the &s;olemn charge given by Mo&s;es to the children of I&s;rael, in which you will find the &s;entences we have now repeated, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> threatenings were executed in the captivity, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> whole family, which God brought up from the land of Egypt.</P>
<P>ABOUT &s;even hundred and twenty years before Chri&s;t, the King of A&s;&s;yria, took the capital of the ten tribes, and carried the inhabitants into captivity.</P>
<P>FIVE hundred and ninety years before Chri&s;t, Je|ru&s;alem was taken by the king of Babylon, the Temple was burned, and the once highly favoured people of God were &s;ubjected to a humble and &s;uf|fering condition, which continued &s;eventy years.</P>
<P>THIS captivity was predicted by Jeremiah, and by &s;everal other prophets.
<Q>Surely thus &s;aith the Lord, &s;o will I give Zedekiah the King of

<P>THE judgments of Heaven, which were inflicted on the whole family of the children of I&s;rael, &s;tand as &s;olemn warnings to all who live in wickedne&s;s: If God &s;pared not the &s;eed of Abraham his friend, but accompli&s;hed the things which he threatened, when they rebelled again&s;t him, no other nation &s;urely can expect to be treated with more tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>TO an&s;wer valuable purpo&s;es in the moral go|vernment of the world, certain periods are marked with the record of awful judgments, which God hath &s;een fit to inflict on the children of men.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="033984_0015_0FF9EF4670997F70">THE deluge, in the time of Noah, was brought on the inhabitants of the earth, as the puni&s;hment of the wickedne&s;s which every where prevailed.</P>
<P><Q>SODOM and Gomorrha, and the cities about them, are &s;et forth for an example, &s;uffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</Q></P>
<P>BESIDES the judgments which were inflicted on Judah and I&s;rael, in con&s;equence of their ingrati|tude and rebellion, the hi&s;tory of later ages, informs us of &s;ea&s;ons, when the inhabitants of the world have been <HI>thinned</HI> and wa&s;ted away by de&s;olating calamities.</P>
<P>IN the year of our Lord 542, a pe&s;tilential di&s;|order appeared fir&s;t in Egypt, on the ea&s;tern chan|nel of the Nile,
<Q>from thence, tracing as it were a double path, it &s;pread to the Ea&s;t, over Syria, Per&s;ia, and the Indies; and penetrated to the We&s;t along the coa&s;t of Africa, and over the continent of Europe.</Q>
This Plague, the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t general on the annals of the world, continued fifty-two years:&mdash;Its progre&s;s was eve|ry where marked, with de&s;olation and ruin. Such were its dreadful ravages, that in &s;trong language it is &s;aid to have "depopulated the earth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, Vol. iv. Dublin. Murator. Tom. 1. pt. 1. p. 426.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="033984_0016_0FF9EF4F11524F98">SOME have &s;uppo&s;ed one third part of the inha|bitants of the world were de&s;troyed by the plague which we have now mentioned: but
<Q>no facts have been pre&s;erved to &s;u&s;tain an account, or even a conjecture, of the numbers that peri&s;hed in this extraordinary mortality.</Q>
<Q>Many cities of the Ea&s;t were left vacant: the decrea&s;e of the human &s;pecies, during that &s;ea&s;on of affliction, has never been repaired in &s;ome of the faire&s;t countries of the globe.</Q></P>
<P>FROM 1346 to 1350, the principal countries of the world were again vi&s;ited with an exten&s;ive Plague. It broke out in <HI>China</HI> in 1346, and pa&s;&s;ed into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies, Syria, Turkey, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>THE next year it raged on the other &s;ide of the Mediterranean.

<P>MANY pages of hi&s;tory are filled with accounts of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es which have thinned off the inhabitants of the world. At &s;ome periods the

<P>IN 1656 the Plague was brought from Sardinia to Naples. It raged with exce&s;&s;ive violence, and in le&s;s than &s;ix months carried off 400,000 of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>IN the latter end of 1664 &s;everal per&s;ons died of a pe&s;tilential di&s;order at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and in the &s;pring after, London was vi&s;ited with a dreadful Plague.

<P><Q>ABOUT the beginning of September the di&s;ea&s;e was at the height.</Q>
Eight, and ten thou&s;and, and even "twelve thou&s;and died in a week."</P>
<P>WITH &s;uch dreadful effect did the Plague con|tinue to rage, until it had

<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the manner in which the in|habitants of the Earth have been cha&s;ti&s;ed at one time and another, what rea&s;on can be offered why we, on this quarter of the globe, &s;hould hope to

<P>LET us now apply the &s;ubject, and endeavour to have our hearts impre&s;&s;ed with the thoughts which have been &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH we can claim no particular relation to the God of Heaven, in con&s;equence of a cove|nant made with our Fathers, like that which was made with the Hebrew Patriarchs, we may gain important in&s;truction from their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>WHILE it is not pretended that the fir&s;t Engli&s;h planters of this country were protected by mira|culous interpo&s;itions of providence, it will be ac|knowledged their enterpri&s;e was a&s;toni&s;hingly &s;uc|ceeded.

And further let me inquire, What is the &s;tate of Religion? We blu&s;h to &s;ay.&mdash;We are obliged to confe&s;s, that while iniqui|ty has abounded, the love of many has waxed cold. The friends of God and of Religion, may adopt the words of Jeremiah, with little variation and &s;ay,
<Q>The ways of Zion mourn, becau&s;e <HI>few</HI> come to the &s;olemn fea&s;ts.</Q>
Never was there a time, when &s;acred things were treated with more neglect. Multitudes &s;peak of Religion as a thing of no con&s;equence; while many treat its in&s;tituti|ons with contempt.</P>
<P>IF our fathers were too &s;trict in the ob&s;ervance of the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, and the rites of religion, the pre&s;ent generation has certainly gone very far to the other extreme.</P>

<P>THE prophet was ordered to &s;ay, unto the whole family of the children of I&s;rael,

This to be &s;ure, is not a comfortable thought: but if pa&s;t di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, excite &s;uch fears and apprehen&s;ions, we &s;hould be unwi&s;e to put them from us, however unplea&s;ant.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>With the hope of doing good, a few thoughts are offered on the cau&s;es of Contagion, and Pe&s;tilential Di&s;ea&s;es, and the means of guarding again&s;t them.</P>
<P><Q>CONTAGION is propagated by three cau&s;es, The air, di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, and goods tran&s;ported from infected places.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Richard Mead,</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is the fir&s;t cau&s;e, which at the pre&s;ent time, engages our particular attention. As we have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;eeds of the Epidemic, which has given us &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s, were imported, it is generally agreed, the cau&s;e is in the air.</P>
<P>WE are therefore naturally led to inquire, what is there in the air we breathe, which may be con|&s;idered as the cau&s;e of contagion and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="033984_0025_0FF9EFE70664C3B8">THE re&s;earches of the philo&s;ophers and chemi&s;ts of the pre&s;ent age, will help us, perhaps, to an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>NEARLY three quarters of
<Q>the ela&s;tic fluids which compo&s;e the inferior &s;tratum of air which we inhabit,</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Lavoi&s;ier Elements of Chemi&s;try.</P>
<P>Fourcroy Elements of Chemi&s;try.</P></NOTE> are noxious, &amp; incapable of &s;upport|ing life. It is by the pre&s;ence of the other quar|ter, that health and life are pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE vital, or life-&s;upporting part of the air, in the modern language of chemi&s;ts, is called <HI>oxygen</HI>: the other parts, <HI>azote.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>azote,</HI> or "mephitic part of atmo&s;pheric air," con&s;i&s;ts of vapours from mud, mar&s;hes, &s;tag|nant waters, fermenting and putrefying &s;ub&s;tances of all kinds; together with the air which has &s;uf|fered the de&s;truction of its <HI>vital</HI> part by pa&s;&s;ing the lungs of all the living creatures, and by &s;upporting all the fires which are burning in all parts of the world.</P>
<P>A <HI>redundancy</HI> of the non-re&s;pirable part of air now mentioned, may be a cau&s;e &s;ufficient to produce pe&s;tilential di&s;orders of the wor&s;t kind.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="033984_0026_0FF9C78DDF1B7C58">LONG continued <HI>heat</HI> without winds and &s;torms, will produce &s;uch a redundancy. Long continued heat will not only produce noxious vapours, but by rarefying the atmo&s;phere near the earth, it will &s;o le&s;&s;en the pre&s;&s;ure, as to &s;uffer tho&s;e vapours to ri&s;e high enough to be received into our lungs&mdash;&s;ome of tho&s;e vapours are &s;o much heavier than the common air, in a temperate &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, as to creep along ju&s;t above the &s;urface of the earth, and &s;ettle down in vallies and low grounds. In the <HI>Grotto del Cano,</HI> the noxious air will kill the dog, who carries his no&s;e near the ground, while a man, erect, receives no injury.</P>
<P>BUT if the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t fatal pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es is to be found in the air, how &s;hall we guard again&s;t them? We cannot prevent the heat. We have no command over the winds. The changes of the weather are, in no degree under our controul.&mdash;We can however remove many of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, which in hot weather, &s;end forth poi|&s;onous <HI>effluvia.</HI> We can keep our &s;treets clean. We can fill up or clean&s;e tho&s;e <HI>docks</HI> and <HI>&s;lips</HI> which <HI>receive,</HI> and which <HI>expo&s;e</HI> the mo&s;t filthy &s;ub|&s;tances, when the water retires. We can bury, or &s;ink in the &s;ea, tho&s;e things which would offend and injure us, if left above ground.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="033984_0027_0FF9EFF8DCC95E98">WE can, from exhau&s;tle&s;s &s;prings on our own penin&s;ula, or from fountains in the vicinity, we can, every day, through the &s;ummer, &s;end refre&s;hing &s;treams, from elevated &s;ituations to all the lower parts of the town.</P>
<P>WE can plant trees on every vacant &s;pot, which will repay us, not only by their beautiful appear|ance, but by drinking up the <HI>azotic gas,</HI> and breath|ing, from their leaves, the pure&s;t air.</P>
<P>WE can keep our&s;elves clean: We can keep our hou&s;es, and particularly our <HI>lodging-chambers</HI> clean: We can refrain from full meals of animal food, and from inebriating liquors: We can do many things to guard again&s;t contagious and pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;es: And when we have done all in our power, we may tru&s;t the providence of God, with an ea&s;y mind.</P>
