<P>THE author con&s;ents to the following publication, by the reque&s;t of many worthy citizens, which he cannot, with propriety, refu&s;e. He doth not expect any particular advantage or applau&s;e thereby, but will be fully &s;atisfied, if, by his endeavours, any new lights may be reflected upon the &s;ubjects contained therein. And indeed the novelty as well as importance of the trials, in which every individual was intere&s;ted, might of them&s;elves excu&s;e his pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>WHY &s;hould I mention <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI> when it is well known, that in this <HI>free</HI> country every one has a right to &s;cribble, if he plea&s;es, and no one can be injured, becau&s;e no one is obliged to read. Reading however is the pa&s;&s;ion of many, as writing is that of &s;ome: If there|fore the reader &s;hould find him&s;elf di&s;gu&s;ted, he may derive one ad|vantage, that of fixing in his mind the retention of more <HI>u&s;eful</HI> reading.</P>
<P>IT may be objected, that writing and publi&s;hing, without affording in&s;truction or plea&s;ure, are detrimental to the Republic, as much time may have been con&s;umed thereby, which ought to have been occupied for valuable purpo&s;es. Without denying the charge, let tho&s;e who have directly or indirectly contributed to the late political mea&s;ures reflect how <HI>their</HI> time has been employed, in fabricating a &s;y&s;tem of revenue and finance, &s;ubver&s;ive of private contracts, and public faith!&mdash; Perhaps a view of contra&s;ted blunder and ab&s;urdity may produce &s;ome good, when the force of argument would be exerted in vain.</P>
<P>BUT why &s;hould the author impo&s;e upon the reader a recital of his <HI>own</HI> tedious, indige&s;ted pleas?&mdash;Why did he not content him&s;elf with a &s;imple relation of facts, and an enumeration of the principal arguments and authorities?&mdash;Becau&s;e he is indolent, and found it le&s;s trouble&s;ome to him&s;elf to write from recollection, than to form a
<PB N="iv" REF="020825_0003_0FB0F8CB6EC7C4E0">
new arrangement and detail of the &s;ubject. Be&s;ides, the orators of Greece and Rome exhibited to the public, in the &s;ame way, their pleadings upon the mo&s;t weighty occa&s;ions. And although the author hath not the vanity to compare him&s;elf to any the lea&s;t of tho&s;e ora|tors, yet he feels a plea&s;ure in <HI>attempting</HI> to imitate them, and to revive that part of ancient learning.</P>
<P>LET it be &s;ubmitted to the candid, whether the frequent publica|tion of pleadings at the bar, upon cau&s;es of importance, would not have a &s;alutary tendency to reform the pre&s;ent manner, &s;o replete with inac|curacies, ab&s;urdities, and (to the &s;hame of &s;ome practitioners) &s;currility it&s;elf?&mdash;</P>
<P>IT is cu&s;tomary, in &s;ome countries, for the ladies to attend upon the trial of popular cau&s;es. What an excellent practice, and how admira|bly calculated to produce elegance of &s;entiment, delicacy of expre&s;&s;ion, and a polite addre&s;s!&mdash;It is true, the pre&s;ence of the fair &s;ex may excite diffidence in the young practitioner; but how amiable is diffidence, how charming is mode&s;ty, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e ridiculous airs, which give to impudence an appearance of knowledge, and to pertne&s;s of &s;peech the re&s;emblance of elocution!&mdash;</P>
<P>WHETHER the preceding ob&s;ervations bear any relation to the matters contained in the following &s;heets, is of very little con&s;equence. For cu&s;tom only renders any thing of the kind expedient.&mdash;To cu&s;tom we &s;ubmit, as a matter of cour&s;e; but to ri&s;e above this foible, perhaps cu&s;|tom &s;hould be treated in her own way.</P>

<P>UPON the la&s;t Monday of September, in the eleventh year of the Independence of the United States, in the city of Newport, and State of Rhode-I&s;land, &amp;c. was heard, before the Superior Court of Judicature, Court of A&s;&s;ize, and General Gaol-Delivery, a certain information, John Trevett again&s;t John Weeden, for refu&s;ing to receive the paper bills of this State, in payment for meat &s;old in market, equivalent to &s;ilver or gold: And upon the day following the Court delivered the unani|mous opinion of the Judges, that the information was not cog|nizable before them.</P>
<P>THAT this important deci&s;ion may be fully comprehended, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to recur to the acts of the General A&s;&s;embly, which &s;uperinduced the trial.&mdash;At the la&s;t May &s;e&s;&s;ion, an act was made for emitting the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, lawful money, in bills, upon land &s;ecurity, which &s;hould pa&s;s in all kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s, and payments of former contracts, upon par with &s;ilver and gold, e&s;timating an ounce of coined &s;ilver at &s;ix &s;hillings and eightpence. Another act was pa&s;&s;ed in the June following, &s;ubjecting every per&s;on who &s;hould refu&s;e the bills in payment for articles offered for &s;ale, or &s;hould make a di&s;tinction in value between them and &s;ilver and gold, or who &s;hould in any manner attempt to depreciate them, to a penal|ty of one hundred pounds, lawful money; one moiety to the State, and the other moiety to the informer; to be recovered before either of the Courts of General Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace, of the Superior Court of Judicature, &amp;c.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE &s;oon evinced the inadequacy of this mea&s;ure to the objects of the Admini&s;tration: And at a &s;e&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly, &s;pecially convened by his Excellency the Governor, upon the third Monday of the following Augu&s;t, ano|ther act was pa&s;&s;ed, in addition to and amendment of that la&s;t mentioned, wherein it is provided, that the fine of one hundred pounds be varied; and that for the future the fine &s;hould not be
<PB N="2" REF="020825_0005_0FB0F8D005D45710">
le&s;s than &s;ix, nor exceed thirty pounds, for the fir&s;t offence: The mode of pro&s;ecution and trial was al&s;o changed, agreeably to the following clau&s;es, "that the complainant &s;hall apply to either of the Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature, &amp;c. within this State, or to either of the Judges of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas within the county where &s;uch offence &s;hall be committed, and lodge his certain information, which &s;hall be i&s;&s;ued by the Judge in the following form," &amp;c. It is then provided, that the per&s;on complained of come before a Court to be &s;pecially convened by the Judge, in three days; "that the &s;aid Court, when &s;o convened, &s;hall proceed to the trial of &s;aid offender, and they are hereby authorized &s;o to do, without any jury, by a majority of the Judges pre&s;ent, according to the laws of the land, and to make adjudication and determination, and that three members be &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a Court, and that the judgment of the Court, if again&s;t the offender &s;o complained of, be forthwith complied with, or that he &s;tand committed to the county gaol, where the &s;aid Court may be &s;itting, till &s;entence be performed, and that the &s;aid judgment of &s;aid Court &s;hall be final and conclu&s;ive, and from which there &s;hall be no appeal; and in &s;aid proce&s;s no e&s;&s;oin, protection, privilege or injunction, &s;hall be in anywi&s;e prayed, granted or allowed."</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of a &s;uppo&s;ed violation of this act, John Tre|vett exhibited his complaint to the Hon. Paul Mumford, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Chief Ju&s;tice of the Superior Court, at his chamber, who cau&s;ed a Special Court to be convened: But as the information was given during the term of the Court, it was referred into the term for con&s;ideration and final determination.</P>
<P>JOHN WEEDEN, being demanded and pre&s;ent in Court, made the following an&s;wer: "That it appears by the act of the General A&s;&s;embly, whereon &s;aid information is founded, that the &s;aid act hath expired, and hath no force: Al&s;o, for that by the &s;aid act the matters of complaint are made triable before Special Courts, incontroulable by the Supreme Judiciary Court of the State: And al&s;o for that the Court is not, by &s;aid act, authorized and
<PB N="3" REF="020825_0006_0FB0F8D1740EA130">
empowered to impannel a jury to try the facts charged in the information; and &s;o the &s;ame is uncon&s;titutional and void."</P>
<P>THIS an&s;wer was enforced, by the author of the&s;e &s;trictures, nearly in the following words:</P>
<P>I DO not appear, may it plea&s;e the Honourable Court, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, &s;o much in the line of my profe&s;&s;ion, as in the character of a citizen, deeply intere&s;ted in the con&s;titutional laws of a free, &s;overeign, independent State. And, indeed, whenever the rights of all the citizens appear to be e&s;&s;entially connected with a controverted que&s;tion, con&s;cious of the dignity of man, we exerci&s;e our legal talents only as means conducive to the great end of political &s;ociety, general happine&s;s. In this arduous, though plea&s;ing pur&s;uit, &s;hould my efforts appear too feeble to &s;upport the attempt, I &s;hall derive a con&s;olation in reflecting, that the learned and honourable gentleman at my right is with me in the defence.</P>
<P>WELL may a profound &s;ilence mark the attention of this numerous and re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly! Well may anxiety be di&s;|played in every countenance! Well may the dignity of the Bench conde&s;cend to our &s;olicitude for a mo&s;t candid and &s;erious attention, &s;eeing that from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country un|til the pre&s;ent moment, a que&s;tion of &s;uch magnitude as that upon which the judgment of the Court is now prayed, hath not been judicially agitated!</P>
<P>HAPPY am I, may it plea&s;e your Honours, in making my warme&s;t acknowledgments to the Court, for permitting the in|formation and the plea to be con&s;idered by them in their &s;upreme judiciary capacity!&mdash;By this indulgent conce&s;&s;ion, we feel our|&s;elves at liberty to animadvert freely upon the illegality of the new-fangled juri&s;dictions erected by the General A&s;&s;embly in the act more immediately in contemplation. The embarra&s;&s;ments naturally accompanying a plea to the juri&s;diction, by removing the cau&s;e from the Special Court into this Court, are totally removed; and, with them, the painful nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;idering
<PB N="4" REF="020825_0007_0FB0F8D2F59D24B8">
your Honours as individually compo&s;ing &s;o dangerous a tribu|nal. The idea of that nece&s;&s;ity is truly alarming, and we cannot do ju&s;tice to our own feelings, without expre&s;&s;ing a fervent wi&s;h that it may hereafter be ever bani&s;hed from the human brea&s;t!</P>
<P>IN di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;everal points &s;tated in the plea, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily call in que&s;tion the validity of the legi&s;lative act upon which the information is grounded. We &s;hall attempt mo&s;t clearly to evince, that it is contrary to the fundamental laws of the State, and therefore, as the civilians expre&s;s it, a mere nulli|ty, and void, <HI>ab initio.</HI> We &s;hall treat, with decent firmne&s;s, upon the nature, limits and extent, of the legi&s;lative powers; and deduce, from a variety of ob&s;ervations and authorities, that the Legi&s;lature may err, do err; and that this act, if we confine our&s;elves to the &s;ubject matter of it, can only be con&s;idered as an act of u&s;urpation; but having been enacted by Legi&s;lators of who&s;e integrity and virtue we have the cleare&s;t conviction, and of who&s;e good intentions we have not a doubt, it will be viewed as an ha&s;ty re&s;olution, incon&s;iderately adopted, and &s;ubject to legal reprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE parties named in the proce&s;s are of no farther con&s;e|quence, than as the one repre&s;ents the almo&s;t forlorn hopes of an hitherto di&s;appointed circle; the other as a victim; the fir&s;t de&s;tined to the fury of their intemperate zeal and politi|cal phrenzy. Why &s;hould the abettors of this &s;alutary act, as many are plea&s;ed to call it, retire behind the curtain, in the day of trial, unle&s;s &s;omething within them declares that all is not right? Or, dare they not appear in the character of informers? Why &s;hould their artillery be levelled again&s;t an unfortunate man, who, not three weeks &s;ince, was an object of charity in the &s;treets of Newport; and now, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Young.</NOTE> poor pen&s;ioner upon the boun|ties of an hour," is called upon to an&s;wer, criminally, for re|fu&s;ing beef at fourpence the pound, when it co&s;t him &s;ixpence upon the hoof, although purcha&s;ed of &s;ome of the mo&s;t influential promoters of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures?&mdash;Were they dubious of the event, or did they feel a reluctance in attacking gentlemen
<PB N="5" REF="020825_0008_0FB0F8D487691840">
of bu&s;ine&s;s, character and fortune, who daily and openly tram|ple upon this favourite idol?&mdash;Were they not acquainted with a Gibbs, and are they not intimately connected with a Cooke?&mdash;</P>
<P>INCOMPARABLE was the &s;entiment of a fine writer, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quieu.</NOTE> that in a democratical government, the cu&s;toms and manners controul the laws:" And whenever an attempt is made to force upon the people a &s;y&s;tem repugnant to their principles, and at which every &s;entiment of integrity mu&s;t reluct, the authors them&s;elves, how|ever &s;anguine in their hopes, will ever betray an in&s;tability in the execution, that generally forebodes di&s;appointment and chagrin. To your Honours, however, it is &s;ubmitted to determine, how far the ob&s;ervation will apply to the cau&s;e on trial. The peace, the honour, the &s;afety of the State, depend upon, and the fate of un|born millions may be affected by it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t point to which we &s;olicit the attention of the Hon. Court is, that the act of the Legi&s;lature, upon which the informa|tion is founded, hath expired.</P>
<P>IN the preamble to this act it is &s;tated, "that the u&s;ual and &s;tated methods and times of holding Courts within this State are impracticable, inexpedient, and inapplicable to the true intent and meaning of the &s;aid act (the act inflicting the hundred pounds penalty) and altogether in&s;ufficient to carry into effect the good purpo&s;es of this Legi&s;lature, touching the &s;ame."</P>
<P>THEN follows: "Be it enacted, that the mode of procedure, and the method of law proce&s;s, again&s;t any per&s;on or per&s;ons who &s;hall be guilty of a breach of the <HI>afore&s;aid</HI> act, &amp;c. &s;hall be as followeth." Hence, it is evident, that the principal aim in this act, is &s;o to modify and vary the proce&s;s, as to enforce the &s;anctions of the former; le&s;&s;ening, however, the fine, to render pro&s;ecutions more familiar and practicable. Examine the act with the mo&s;t critical exactne&s;s; there is not a clau&s;e in it which creates a crime, or defines or qualifies an action, &s;o as to infer the idea of criminality. Ob&s;erve therefore a &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;e, which
<PB N="6" REF="020825_0009_0FB0F8D60C1619D8">
enacts, "that the legal mode of carrying the <HI>afore-recited</HI> act into execution &s;hall be in force fully and completely, for every purpo&s;e therein mentioned and contained, until all offences again&s;t which have been committed and complained of, and which may be committed and complained of, until the expiration of ten days after the ri&s;ing of this A&s;&s;embly, may be fully heard, tried and determined; any thing in this act to the contrary in anywi&s;e notwith&s;tanding." What then hath become of the <HI>legal mode,</HI> pointed out in the act, &s;ince the expiration of the <HI>ten days</HI> there|in mentioned? What other legal mode, than that in que&s;tion, is taken notice of? That is the only antecedent to the limiting clau&s;e; at lea&s;t, it is the la&s;t antecedent; and &s;o grammatically, as well as legally, is intended to continue in force the &s;aid &s;pace of <HI>ten days.</HI></P>
<P>"THE legal mode" "&s;hall be in force" "until the expiration of ten days;" con&s;equently, at the expiration of ten days there was an end of it.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Blac. Com. 88.</NOTE>FOR penal &s;tatutes are to be con&s;trued &s;trictly; not only with regard to the crime and the penalty, but al&s;o with re&s;pect to the proce&s;s; more e&s;pecially when the manner of trial is repug|nant to the common law.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that &s;tatutes, made <HI>pro publico bono</HI> (not <HI>malo,</HI> as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance) claim a liberal con&s;truction. Of that kind may be deemed, in legal contemplation, the emitting act, whereby it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the means of commerce and other bu&s;ine&s;s are enlarged: But this act and the former penal act becoming one, are altogether penal. They are not directed to the public good; nor are they &s;o formed, as to be entitled to liberal con&s;truction.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be objected, that this con&s;truction would manife&s;tly oppo&s;e and fru&s;trate the general intent of the Legi&s;lature; I an&s;wer, the Courts of law will endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h the actual meaning of the Legi&s;lature, if not oppo&s;ed by a plain, legal con|&s;truction:
<PB N="7" REF="020825_0010_0FB0F8D81EBEA6B8">
But as they are &s;worn to judge according to law, they cannot depart from this rule of deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT, may it plea&s;e your Honours, we do not place our prin|cipal reliance upon this objection, although in legal propriety we might &s;afely meet the con&s;equences. The whole frame of the act is &s;o replete with blunders, contradictions and ab&s;urdities, that not a trace of law-learning can be di&s;covered in it. And to the honour of tho&s;e of the profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen, who prefer the good of their country to the paltry gains of bu&s;ine&s;s, they had not any thing to do with it; nor any one el&s;e who under|&s;tood, or, if he under&s;tood, duly con&s;idered what he was about.</P>
<P>WE now proceed to the &s;econd point &s;tated in the plea, "that by the act of the Legi&s;lature &s;pecial trials are in&s;tituted, incontroulable by the Supreme Judiciary Court of the State."</P>
<P>THERE are, in all free governments, three di&s;tinct &s;ources of power, the legi&s;lative, the judiciary and executive. The judi|ciary power is more or le&s;s perfect, as the formation of the Courts of law tends to produce certainty and uniformity in legal deter|minations. And indeed without certainty and uniformity in the judicial tribunals, the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tem of laws will prove en|tirely inadequate to the &s;ecurity of the people. For law it&s;elf is but a rule of action; and con&s;equently its very exi&s;tence is de|&s;troyed, when contradictory deci&s;ions are admitted upon the &s;ame point. From hence may clearly be inferred the nece&s;&s;ity of a Supreme Judiciary Court, to who&s;e judgments, as the only con|clu&s;ive evidence in law que&s;tions, all &s;ubordinate juri&s;dictions mu&s;t conform. Such is the Court before which I now have the honour of appearing. Into the nature and extent of who&s;e juri&s;|diction permit me, with humble deference, to enquire.</P>
<P>IN the charter, granted by King Charles the Second, it is granted, to the Governor and Company, when convened in their legi&s;lative capacity, "to appoint, order and direct, erect and &s;et|tle, &s;uch places and Courts of Juri&s;diction, for the hearing and determining of all actions, matters and things, within the &s;aid
<PB N="8" REF="020825_0011_0FB0F8D93426D480">
Colony and Plantation, and which &s;hall be in di&s;pute, and depend|ing there, as they &s;hall think fit; and al&s;o to di&s;tingui&s;h and &s;et forth the &s;everal names and titles, duties, powers and limits, of each Court, office and officer, &s;uperior and inferior." In con|&s;equence whereof, the General A&s;&s;embly, in the year 1729, e&s;tabli&s;hed this Court in its pre&s;ent form "<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">State laws, 51.</NOTE> a Superior Court of Judicature, Court of A&s;&s;ize, and General Gaol-Delivery, over the whole Colony, for the regular hearing and trying all pleas, real, per&s;onal and mixed, and all pleas of the Crown." That they &s;hall have "the &s;ame power and authority, in all matters and things in this Colony, as the Court of Common Pleas, King's Bench, or Exchequer, have, or ought to have, in that part of Great-Britain heretofore called England, and be empowered to give judgment in all matters and things before them cognizable, and to award execution thereon."</P>
<P>THIS e&s;tabli&s;hment hath never been varied, nor the juri&s;dic|tion of the Court dimini&s;hed. The powers annexed to it were derived from the charter, from our original con&s;titution; and by an uninterrupted exerci&s;e have become matters of common right. In point of antiquity, we find them exi&s;ting, in full vigour, in the earlie&s;t periods of which we have any regular traces of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. It is unnece&s;&s;ary however to look any far|ther back than to the Norman reigns, when ju&s;tice was exerci&s;ed in one Court, called the "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Hawk. P. C. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>aula regis</HI>;" "out of this Court the Courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer &s;eem to have been derived, &s;ome time before the making the &s;tatute of Magna Char|ta; the former of which Courts properly determines pleas merely civil, and the latter tho&s;e relating to the revenue of the Crown. And after the erection of the&s;e Courts, the Supreme Court &s;eems by degrees to have obtained the name of the Court of King's Bench, and hath always retained a &s;upreme juri&s;diction in all criminal matters."</P>
<P>THE extent of the&s;e powers is well defined by the author la&s;t referred to, as well as by mo&s;t of the writers upon the &s;ubject. "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Hawk. P. C. 8.</NOTE> There is no doubt but that this Court, being the highe&s;t Court
<PB N="9" REF="020825_0012_0FB0F8DBC196FB80">
of common law, hath not only power to rever&s;e erroneous judg|ments, given by Inferior Courts, but al&s;o to puni&s;h all inferior Magi&s;trates, and all officers of ju&s;tice, for all wilful and corrupt abu&s;es of their authority."</P>
<P>IT commands, prohibits and re&s;trains, all inferior juri&s;dictions, whenever they attempt to exceed their authority, or refu&s;e to exerci&s;e it for the public good, or upon the application of in|dividuals. There are many in&s;tances, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in which no appeal is allowed from other Courts to this Court; and in &s;uch ca&s;es it will not interpo&s;e its &s;upreme controul, unle&s;s the other Courts exceed their authority, or otherwi&s;e, as before men|tioned.</P>
<P>LET us illu&s;trate the &s;ubject by reflecting, for a moment, upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our Courts of General Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace. They are five in number, corre&s;ponding to the five counties of the State. They have cognizance of all crimes not capital, ari&s;ing within their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and their juri&s;dictions are perfectly equal. Suppo&s;e them exerci&s;ing their legal judgments upon the &s;ame law; and that this law is of a complicated nature, admitting of different con&s;tructions, both in the definition of the crime, and the mode of puni&s;hment: May we not, mu&s;t we not, conclude, that the &s;ame law would have different operations in the dif|ferent counties?&mdash;Hence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upreme controul, of a common &s;tandard, to which the opinions of the&s;e five Judi|catories &s;hall be conformable. The citizens are entitled not only to liberty, ari&s;ing from the &s;ecurity which the laws afford, but they are equally entitled, and entitled to equal liberty. They mu&s;t, therefore, they will apply to one tribunal, as to a focal point, where the knowledge of the law is concentered, and from whence its voice will be heard with irre&s;i&s;tible conviction, con|firming the principles of univer&s;al equality.</P>
<P>HAD the cognizance of informations been confined to the Courts of Se&s;&s;ions only, the evil might have been remedied, with|out appeal, by writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, Mandamus and Procedendo; but by an unheard of arrangement in the &s;pecial
<PB N="10" REF="020825_0013_0FB0F8DD73DD8AC8">
juri&s;dictions, the Judges of this Court are preci&s;ely upon a level with tho&s;e of the Se&s;&s;ions. Their juri&s;diction is concurrent, cumulative and equal. Con&s;equently there would not be a pro|priety in applying to this Court, in their &s;upreme judicial capa|ciety, to correct the errors and re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es that might ari&s;e from oppre&s;&s;ive determinations. For in the &s;econd, they might counteract their fir&s;t deliberations, or refu&s;e to grant re|dre&s;s: But by their fir&s;t deci&s;ions, as a Special Court, a legal pre|judice would naturally be formed in the minds of the Judges individually, which might totally ob&s;truct the avenues to ju&s;tice. The pride of opinion is more or le&s;s prevalent in all men, how|ever exalted their &s;tations; and however conformably the inten|tion may be to the principles of rectitude, the judgment will be bia&s;&s;ed by pre-exi&s;ting opinions.</P>
<P>MAKING every po&s;&s;ible conce&s;&s;ion for the &s;ake of the argu|ment, the Supreme Judiciary Court could only correct the errors of its own Judges, determining in the Special Court; and there|fore the extravagancies that might accompany the proceedings of the other five Courts, could not, in any po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e, be re|prehended.</P>
<P><HI>May it plea&s;e your Honours,</HI></P>
<P>AS all the glory of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem is reflected from yonder refulgent luminary, &s;o the irradiations of the inferior juri&s;dic|tions are derived from the re&s;plendent controul of this <HI>primum mobile</HI> in the civil admini&s;tration. Under its genial influence, therefore, we beg liberty to con&s;ider the la&s;t point &s;ubmitted to the judgment of the Court, "that by the act of the Legi&s;lature the Court is not authorized or empowered to impannel a jury for trying the facts complained of in the information."</P>
<P>THE propo&s;ition cannot be controverted: The expre&s;&s;ions in the act, "that the majority of the Judges pre&s;ent &s;hall proceed to hear, &amp;c. without any jury," do not require a comment.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be objected that this clau&s;e of the act only empowers the Judges to try the fact, when the parties will agree to wave
<PB N="11" REF="020825_0014_0FB0F8DF24B30CD0">
the trial by jury, it will be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, that the General A&s;&s;embly intended directly the contrary. It is well known by all pre&s;ent, that on one day this clau&s;e was rejected, but on the day following (in con&s;equence of a nocturnal <HI>imperium in imperio,</HI> or convention of part of the members) a motion was made for receding, and they did recede accordingly. The general tenor of the act was &s;o repugnant to the hone&s;t feelings of the people, when excited by &s;ober reflection, that the junto out of doors, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome leading men within, were apprehen&s;ive that convictions would not take place in the u&s;ual mode of trial. They aimed therefore at a &s;ummary proce&s;s, flattering them|&s;elves that the Judges, being elected by the Legi&s;lators, would blindly &s;ubmit to their &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure. But, happy for the State, our Courts in general are not intimidated by the dread, nor influenced by the debauch of power!&mdash;</P>
<P>THIS part of the &s;ubject, and which is by far the mo&s;t im|portant, will require a more ample di&s;cu&s;&s;ion than the preceding. I mu&s;t therefore beg the attention of the Honourable Court to the following con&s;iderations: That the trial by jury is a fundament|al right, a part of our legal con&s;titution: That the Legi&s;lature cannot deprive the citizens of this right: And that your Honours can, and we tru&s;t will, &s;o determine.</P>

Then, after a long interval, by the Peti|tion of Right; which was a parliamentary declaration of the liber|ties of the people, a&s;&s;ented to by King Charles the Fir&s;t in the beginning of his reign. Which was clo&s;ely followed by the &s;till more ample conce&s;&s;ions made by that unhappy Prince to his Parliament, before the fatal rupture between them; and by the many &s;alutary laws, particularly the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act, pa&s;&s;ed under Charles the Second. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded the Bill of Rights, or declaration delivered by the Lords and Commons to the Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange, February 13, 1688; and afterwards enacted in Parliament, when they became King and Queen: Which declaration concludes in the&s;e remarkable words: "And they do claim, demand, and in&s;i&s;t, upon all and &s;ingular the premi&s;es, as their undoubted rights and liberties." And the act of Parliament it&s;elf recognizes "all and &s;ingular the rights and liberties, a&s;&s;erted and claimed in the &s;aid declaration, to be the true, ancient and indubitable rights of the people of this kingdom." La&s;tly, the&s;e liberties were again a&s;&s;erted, at the commencement of the pre&s;ent century, in the act of &s;ettle|ment, whereby the Crown was limited to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's illu&s;trious hou&s;e, and &s;ome new provi&s;ions were added at the &s;ame fortunate aera, for better &s;ecuring our religion, laws, and liberties; which the &s;tatute declares to be "the birthright of the people of England;" according to the ancient doctrine of the common law." The &s;ame elegant writer, who appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s the highe&s;t degree of information in legal hi&s;tory, ob&s;erves, when &s;peaking of this palladium of liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">3 Blac.

Some authors have endeavoured to trace the original of juries up as high as the Britons them&s;elves, the fir&s;t inhabitants of our i&s;land; but certain it is, that they were in u&s;e among the earlie&s;t Saxon Colonies, their in&s;titution being a&s;cribed by Bi&s;hop Nichol&s;on to Woden him&s;elf, their great Legi&s;lator and Captain. Hence it is, that we may find traces of juries in the laws of all tho&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="020825_0016_0FB0F8E30B686CE8">
nations which adopted the feodal &s;y&s;tem, as in Germany, France, and Italy; who had all of them a tribunal compo&s;ed of twelve good men and true, <HI>"boni homines,"</HI> u&s;ually the va&s;&s;als or tenants of the Lord, being equals or peers of the parties litigant: And, as the Lord's va&s;&s;als, judged each other in the Lord's Courts; &s;o the King's va&s;&s;als, or the Lords them&s;elves, judged each other in the King's Court. In England we find actual mention of them &s;o early as the laws of King Ethelred, and that not as a new invention. Stiernhook a&s;cribes the invention of the jury, which in the Teuto|nic language is denominated <HI>nembda,</HI> to Regner, King of Sweden and Denmark, who was cotemporary with our King Egbert: Ju&s;t as we are apt to impute the invention of this, and &s;ome other pieces of juridical polity, to the &s;uperior genius of Alfred the Great; to whom, on account of his having done much, it is u&s;ual to attribute every thing: And as the tradition of ancient Greece placed to the account of their own Hercules whatever atchievement was performed &s;uperior to the ordinary prowe&s;s of mankind. Whereas the truth &s;eems to be, that this tribunal was univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed among all the northern nations, and &s;o in|terwoven in their very con&s;titution, that the earlie&s;t accounts of the one give us al&s;o &s;ome traces of the other. Its e&s;tabli&s;hment however and u&s;e, in this i&s;land, of what date &s;oever it be, though for a time greatly impaired and &s;haken by the introduction of the Norman trial by battle, was always &s;o highly e&s;teemed and valued by the people, that no conque&s;t, no change of government, could ever prevail to aboli&s;h it. In Magna Charta it is more than once in&s;i&s;ted on as the principal bulwark of our liberties: But e&s;pe|cially, by cap. 29, that no freeman &s;hall be hurt, in either his per&s;on or property, <HI>"ni&s;i per legale judicium parium &s;uorum vel per legem terrae."</HI> A privilege which is couched in almo&s;t the &s;ame words with that of the Emperor Conrad, two hundred years before: <HI>"Nemo beneficium &s;uum perdat, ni&s;i &s;ecundum con&s;uetu|dinem antece&s;&s;orum no&s;trorum et per judicium parium &s;uorum."</HI> And it was ever e&s;teemed, in all countries, a privilege of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t beneficial nature."</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in Judge Black&s;tone's Commentaries, from the variety of authorities to which he refers, and from many
<PB N="14" REF="020825_0017_0FB0F8E441E7F210">
others of the greate&s;t reputation, it mo&s;t clearly appears, that the trial by jury was ever e&s;teemed a fir&s;t, a fundamental, and a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principle, in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. From England this &s;acred right was transferred to this country, and hath continued, through all the changes in our government, the firm ba&s;is of our liberty, the faire&s;t inheritance tran&s;mitted by our ance&s;tors!</P>
<P>THE &s;ettlers in this country, from whom we are de&s;cended, were Engli&s;hmen: They gloried in their rights as &s;uch: But being per&s;ecuted in matters of religion, over which no earthly tribunal can have the controul, they bravely determined to quit their native &s;oil, to bid a final adieu to the alluring charms of their &s;ituation, and commit their future exi&s;tence to that Al|mighty Power, who&s;e authority they dared not to infringe, but in who&s;e protection they could &s;afely confide. They tempted the foaming billows, they braved, they conquered the boi&s;terous Atlantic, and re&s;ted in an howling wilderne&s;s, amid&s;t the horrid caverns of the untamed bea&s;ts, and the more dangerous haunts of &s;avage men! They retained their virtue, their religion, and their inviolable attachment to the con&s;titutional rights of their former country. They did not withdraw or wi&s;h to withdraw them&s;elves from their allegiance to the Crown, but emigrated under a &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance of receiving protection, &s;o far as their &s;itu|ation might require, and other circum&s;tances render practicable.</P>
<P>THE laws of the realm, being the birthright of all the &s;ubjects, followed the&s;e pious adventurers to their new habitations, where, increa&s;ing in numbers, amid&s;t innumerable difficulties, they were formed into Colonies by royal Charters, in nature of &s;olemn com|pacts, confirming and enlarging their privileges.</P>
<P>IN the Charter granted to our forefathers, the following para|graph claims our particular attention: "That all and every the &s;ubjects of us, our heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, which are already plant|ed and &s;ettled within our &s;aid Colony of Providence Plantations, which &s;hall hereafter go to inhabit within the &s;aid Colony, and all and every of their children, which have been born there, or
<PB N="15" REF="020825_0018_0FB0F8E5B097A6C8">
on the &s;ea going thither, or returning from thence, &s;hall have and enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural &s;ubjects, within any of the dominions of us, our heirs or &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, to all intents, con&s;tructions and purpo&s;es what&s;oever, as if they, and every of them, were born within the realm of Eng|land."</P>
<P>THIS conce&s;&s;ion was declaratory of, and fully confirmed to the people the Magna Charta, and other fundamental laws of England. And accordingly, in the very fir&s;t meeting of the General A&s;&s;embly, after receiving the charter, in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-three, they made and pa&s;&s;ed an act, "declaring the rights and privileges of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects within this Colony," whereby it is enacted, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Laws, 226.</NOTE> that no freeman &s;hall be taken or impri&s;oned, or be deprived of his freehold or liberty, or free cu&s;toms, or be outlawed, or exiled, or otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed, nor &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed upon, judged or con|demned, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the laws of this Colony: And that no man, of what e&s;tate or condition &s;oever, &s;hall be put out of his lands and tenements, nor taken, nor impri&s;oned, nor di&s;inherited, nor bani&s;hed, nor any ways de&s;troyed, nor mole&s;ted, without for it being brought to an&s;wer by due cour&s;e of law. And that all rights and privileges, grant|ed to this Colony by his Maje&s;ty's Charter, be entirely kept and pre&s;erved to all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, re&s;iding in or belonging to the &s;ame."</P>
<P>THIS act, may it plea&s;e the Honourable Court, was not creative of a new law, but declaratory of the rights of all the people, as de|rived through the Charter from their progenitors, time out of mind. It exhibited the mo&s;t valuable part of their political con|&s;titution, and formed a &s;acred &s;tipulation that it &s;hould never be violated. It would be a plea&s;ing, and perhaps an u&s;eful employ|ment, to trace and point out the numerous in&s;tances wherein the General A&s;&s;embly have re-a&s;&s;erted the&s;e &s;olemn rights; but time will not admit of a minute detail. I cannot however be entirely &s;ilent upon this head.</P>

<P>THE attempts of the Briti&s;h Parliament to deprive us of this mode of trial were among the principal cau&s;es that united the Colonies in a defen&s;ive war, and finally effected the glorious revolution. This is evident from the Declaration of Rights made by the fir&s;t Congre&s;s, in October, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-four: The preamble &s;tates, "that the inhabitants of the Engli&s;h Colonies, in North-America, by
<PB N="17" REF="020825_0020_0FB0F8E9798F65B8">
the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution, and the &s;everal charters and compacts, have the fol|lowing rights," the fifth of which is,</P>
<P>"THAT the re&s;pective Colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more e&s;pecially to the great and ine&s;tima|ble privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, ac|cording to the cour&s;e of that law."</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time they enumerated the &s;everal acts of the Bri|ti&s;h Parliament to which they declared they could not &s;ubmit, particularly "12 Geo. 3, chap. 24, intituled, "an act for the better &s;ecuring his Maje&s;ty's dock-yards, magazines, &s;hips, am|munition and &s;tores," which declares a new offence in America, and deprives the American &s;ubject of a con&s;titutional trial by jury of the vicinage, by authorizing the trial of any per&s;on charged with the committing any offence de&s;cribed in the act out of the realm, to be indicted and tried for the &s;ame in any &s;hire or county within the realm."</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of the &s;ame principle, upon the ever memorable fourth of July, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;even|ty-&s;ix, when the rights of the United States were exhibited in a new blaze of glory!

<P>ASTONISHED am I, may it plea&s;e the Honourable Court, that a doubt &s;hould have ari&s;en in the mind of any, re&s;pecting the legal con&s;truction of our Magna Charta, our declaration of rights! Some of our warme&s;t politicians, who&s;e heads are undoubtedly wrong, and it is greatly to be feared their hearts are not right, have bold|ly a&s;&s;erted, that the clau&s;e which declares "that no freeman, &amp;c. &s;hall be tried, &amp;c. but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the laws of the Colony," &amp;c. clearly authorizes any other mode of trial than that by jury, &s;hould the Legi&s;lature frame a law for that purpo&s;e. That their act would become the law of the land, and &s;o the &s;pecial juri&s;dictions are perfectly conformable to the let|ter and &s;pirit of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e pretenders to the knowledge of law &s;hould be &s;erious, when they avow &s;o dangerous an opinion?&mdash;If they are, let them be informed that they contradict the wi&s;dom and the practice of ages. That whenever a &s;tatute makes mention of "the law of the land," it refers either to a particular pre-exi&s;ting law, to the &s;y&s;tem of laws in general, or to the mode of legal proce&s;s.</P>
<P>LORD Coke, in his readings upon the &s;tatute, hath fully de|mon&s;trated that the clau&s;e "or by the law of the land," regards the proce&s;s only. That the particle <HI>or</HI> is to be con&s;trued con|junctively. And &s;o the &s;entence will read, "by the lawful judg|ment of his peers, by, or according to, the law of the land," or, "and by the law of the land:" That is to &s;ay, by bill, plaint, information, or in any other legal manner.</P>

And upon this unju&s;t and injurious act (as commonly in like ca&s;es it falleth out) a new office was erected, and they made ma&s;ters of the King's forfeitures. But at the Parliament holden in the fi&s;t year of Henry VIII. this act of the eleventh of Henry VII. is recited and made void. For that by force of &s;aid act it was manife&s;tly known, that many &s;ini&s;ter and crafty, feigned and forged, informations had been pur&s;ued again&s;t divers of the King's &s;ubjects, to their great damage and wrongful vexation.

<P><PB N="21" REF="020825_0024_0FB0F8F03B518818">WHEN mankind entered into a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety, they &s;ur|rendered a part of their natural rights into the hands of the com|munity, that they might enjoy the remainder with greater &s;ecu|rity. The aggregate of this &s;urrender forms the power of govern|ment; the fir&s;t and greate&s;t exerci&s;e of which con&s;titutes legi&s;la|tion, or the power of making laws.

<P>IN the infant &s;tate of &s;ociety, when the community con&s;i&s;ted of but few members, when their wants and de&s;ires were circum|&s;cribed within narrow bounds, the power of making laws was exerci&s;ed by all the people a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e, or at lea&s;t by the heads of families, who derived from nature a temporary authority over their offspring. Whatever was nece&s;&s;ary for the good or &s;afety of the whole was agreed to, and each individual engaged to abide by the opinion of the majority. Such was the &s;ituation of our ance&s;tors, when they fir&s;t &s;ettled in this country.</P>
<P>AS &s;ociety increa&s;ed in numbers and wealth, as their &s;ettle|ments were extended, and their views enlarged, it became nece&s;|&s;ary to delegate the powers of legi&s;lation, and ve&s;t them in one per&s;on, in a few, or in many, as the community deemed mo&s;t conducive to their common advantage. Such was the &s;ituation of our ance&s;tors, when they petitioned to King Charles II. to be incorporated into a company, with the power of governing them|&s;elves. Fir&s;t by making of laws in a General A&s;&s;embly, to be convened twice in each year, compo&s;ed of magi&s;trates elected annually by the freemen at large, and of deputies cho&s;en &s;emi-annually from the re&s;pective towns as their repre&s;entatives.

<P>THE powers of legi&s;lation, in every po&s;&s;ible in&s;tance, are derived from the people at large, are altogether fiduciary, and &s;ubordinate to the a&s;&s;ociation by which they are formed.

<P>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vattel, P. 12.</NOTE>IN the act of a&s;&s;ociation, in virtue of which a multitude of men form together a &s;tate or nation, each individual has en|tered into engagements with all, to procure the common wel|fare; and all have entered into engagements with each individual to facilitate for him the means of &s;upplying his nece&s;&s;ities, and to protect and defend him. It is manife&s;t that the&s;e reciprocal engagements can no otherwi&s;e be fulfilled, than by maintaining the political a&s;&s;ociation. The entire nation is then obliged to maintain that a&s;&s;ociation; and as in its duration the pre&s;ervation of the nation con&s;i&s;ts, it follows from thence that every nation is obliged to perform the duty of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation."</P>

The nation ought then to watch very atten|tively, in order to render them equally re&s;pected by tho&s;e who govern, and by the people de&s;tined to obey. To attack the

The nation ought con&s;tantly to &s;up|pre&s;s the&s;e abu&s;es with its utmo&s;t vigour and vigilance, as the importance of the ca&s;e requires.

<P>BUT here, the attack is open and bold;&mdash;it comes with violence;&mdash;it moves with huge gigantic &s;trides, and threatens &s;lavery or death!&mdash;</P>
<P>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vattel, P. 18&punc;</NOTE>A VERY important que&s;tion here pre&s;ents it&s;elf. It e&s;&s;en|tially belongs to the &s;ociety to make laws, both in relation to the manner in which it de&s;ires to be governed, and to the conduct of the citizens. This is called the legi&s;lative power. The nation may entru&s;t the exerci&s;e of it to the Prince, or to an A&s;&s;embly; or to that A&s;&s;embly and the Prince jointly; who have then a right of making new, and abrogating old laws. It is here de|manded, whether, if their power extends &s;o far as to the funda|mental laws, they may change the con&s;titution of the State? The principles we have laid down lead us to decide this point with certainty, that the authority of the&s;e legi&s;lators does not extend &s;o far; and that they ought to con&s;ider the fundamental laws as &s;acred, if the nation has not, in very expre&s;s terms, given them the power to change them. For the con&s;titution of the State ought to be fixed; and &s;ince that was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by the nation, which afterwards tru&s;ted certain per&s;ons with the legi&s;la|tive power, the fundamental laws are excepted from their com|mi&s;&s;ion. It appears that the &s;ociety had only re&s;olved to make provi&s;ion for the State's being always furni&s;hed with laws &s;uited to particular conjunctures; and gave the Legi&s;lature, for that purpo&s;e, the power of abrogating the ancient, civil and political laws that were not fundamental, and of making new ones; but nothing leads us to think that it was willing to &s;ubmit the con|&s;titution

it&s;elf to their plea&s;ure. In &s;hort, the&s;e legi&s;lators derive their power from the con&s;titution; how then can they change it, without de&s;troying the foundation of their authority?"</P>
<P>HAVE the citizens of this State ever entru&s;ted their legi&s;lators with the power of altering their con&s;titution?&mdash;If they have, when and where was the &s;olemn meeting of all the people for that pur|po&s;e?&mdash;By what public in&s;trument have they declared it, or in what part of their conduct have they betrayed &s;uch extravagance and folly?&mdash;For what have they contended through a long, painful and bloody war, but to &s;ecure inviolate, and tran&s;mit un|&s;ullied to po&s;terity, the ine&s;timable privileges they received from their forefathers?&mdash;Will they &s;uffer the glorious price of all their toils to be wre&s;ted from them, and lo&s;t forever, by the men of their own creating?&mdash;They who have &s;natched their liberty from the jaws of the Briti&s;h lion, amid&s;t the thunders of contending nations, will they ba&s;ely &s;urrender it to the Admini&s;tration of a year?&mdash;As &s;oon may the great Michael kick the beam, and Lucifer riot in the &s;poils of angels!&mdash;</P>
<P>CONSTITUTION!&mdash;we have none:&mdash;Who dares to &s;ay that?&mdash;None but a Briti&s;h emi&s;&s;ary, or a traitor to his country. &mdash;Are there any &s;uch among&s;t us?&mdash;The language hath been heard, and God forbid that they &s;hould continue!</P>
<P>IF we have not a con&s;titution, by what authority doth our General A&s;&s;embly convene to make laws, and levy taxes? Their appointment by the freemen of the towns, excluding the idea of a pre-exi&s;ting &s;ocial compact, cannot &s;eparately give them power to make laws compul&s;ory upon the other towns. They could only meet, in that ca&s;e, to form a &s;ocial compact between the people of the towns. But they do meet by the appointment of their re&s;pective towns, at &s;uch times and places, and in &s;uch num|bers, as they have been accu&s;tomed to do from the beginning. When met, they make laws and levy taxes, and their con&s;tituents obey tho&s;e laws, and pay their taxes. Con&s;equently they meet, deliberate and enact, in virtue of a con&s;titution, which, if they attempt to de&s;troy, or in any manner infringe, they violate the
<PB N="26" REF="020825_0029_0FB0F8F872C037D0">
tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and &s;o their acts are not to be con&s;idered as laws, or binding upon the people.</P>
<P>BUT as the Legi&s;lative is the &s;upreme power in government, who is to judge whether they have violated the con&s;titutional rights of the people?&mdash;I an&s;wer, their &s;upremacy (con&s;i&s;ting in the power of making laws, agreeably to their appointment) is derived from the con&s;titution, is &s;ubordinate to it, and therefore, whenever they attempt to en&s;lave the people, and carry their attempts into execution, the people them&s;elves will judge, as the only re&s;ort in the la&s;t &s;tages of oppre&s;&s;ion. But when they pro|ceed no farther than merely to enact what they may call laws, and refer tho&s;e to the Judiciary Courts for determination, then, (in di&s;charge of the great tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and to prevent the horrors of a civil war, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e) the Judges can, and we tru&s;t your Honours will, decide upon them.&mdash;</P>
<P>IN de&s;potic countries, where the &s;overeign mandate i&s;&s;ues from the throne &s;urrounded by &s;ervile flatterers, &s;ycophants and knaves, the Judge hath nothing more to do than execute. His office is altogether mini&s;terial, being the pa&s;&s;ive tool of that lawle&s;s domi|nation by which he was appointed. Properly &s;peaking, the judi|ciary power cannot exi&s;t where political freedom is bani&s;hed from the admini&s;tration. For without a &s;y&s;tem of laws, defining and protecting the rights of the people, there can be no fixed principles or rules of deci&s;ion. Hence it is, that wherever the di&s;tinct pow|ers of government are united in one head, whether that head con|&s;i&s;ts of one, or of many, the &s;ubjects groan under perpetual &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>I SAY of one or of many: For it is very immaterial by whom &s;courges, chains and tortures, are inflicted, provided we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to them. The &s;tudied and unheard of cruelties of a Di|ony&s;ius, who violated every right of humanity in his tyranny over the Syracu&s;ians during the &s;pace of thirty-eight years, were not more horrid and execrable than the united barbarities of the Coun|cil of Thirty, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Athens, who cau&s;ed more citizens to be murdered in eight months of peace, than their enemies had de|&s;troyed in a thirty years war!</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="020825_0030_0FB0F8F9FA3AD858">NOR am I capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between an e&s;tabli&s;hed ty|ranny, and that government where the Legi&s;lative makes the law, and dictates to the Judges their adjudication. For in that ca&s;e, were they to enact tyrannical laws, they would be &s;ure to have them executed in a tyrannical manner. The &s;ervility of the Courts would render them totally &s;ub&s;ervient to the will of their ma&s;ters, and the people mu&s;t be in&s;laved, or fly to arms.</P>
<P>IN civil as well as moral agency there is a freedom of the will nece&s;&s;arily exerted in forming the judgment. Without the exer|ci&s;e of this, we cannot be &s;aid to determine at all, but our actions are wholly pa&s;&s;ive; and &s;o, in a moral &s;en&s;e, we could not be ac|countable, and in a civil point of view we &s;hould be deprived of all liberty.</P>
<P>EVERY being naturally endeavours its own pre&s;ervation; and the more conformably its actions are to its nature, the nearer it ap|proaches to perfection: But when its actions are impelled by ex|ternal force, it is deprived of the means both of pre&s;ervation and of perfection.</P>
<P>A NATION may be con&s;idered as a moral being, who&s;e health and &s;trength con&s;i&s;t in the due proportion, nice adju&s;tment and equal pre&s;ervation, of all its parts: And when one branch of the government &s;teps into the place of another, and u&s;urps its func|tions, the health and the &s;trength of the nation are impaired: And &s;hould the evil be continued, &s;o as that the one be de&s;troyed by the other, the nation it&s;elf would be in danger of di&s;&s;olution.</P>

But this became a State in order to &s;upport its fundamental, con&s;titu|tional laws, again&s;t the encroachments of Great-Britain. The trial by jury, as hath been fully &s;hewn, is a fundamental, a con&s;titu|tional law; and therefore is binding upon the Judges by a double tie, the oath of allegiance, and the oath of office.</P>
<P>IT is a rule in ethics, "that if two duties or obligations, both of which cannot be performed, urge us at the &s;ame time, we mu&s;t omit the le&s;&s;er, and embrace the greater."</P>
<P>LET the que&s;tion then fairly be &s;tated. The General A&s;&s;em|bly have made a law, and directed the Judges to execute it by a mode of trial repugnant to the con&s;titution. What are the Judges to re&s;olve?&mdash;Did the nature of their juri&s;diction admit of &s;uch a mode of trial at the times of their appointment and taking the oath of office?&mdash;Surely it did not.

In refu&s;ing, they incur no pe|nalty; nor can their &s;o doing work a forfeiture of their offices as Judges of the Supreme Judiciary Court. But when it is con&s;i|dered that the exerci&s;e of this office would be acting contrary to their oath of allegiance, and the oath of office, they are bound to reject it, unle&s;s the General A&s;&s;embly have power to ab&s;olve them from the&s;e oaths, and compel them to accept of any appoint|ment they may be plea&s;ed to make.</P>

<P>BUT the Judges, and all others, are bound by the laws of nature in preference to any human laws, becau&s;e they were ordained by God him&s;elf anterior to any civil or political in&s;titutions.

<P>WE again read in Bacon's Abridgment, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">4 vol. 643.</NOTE> "the power of con&s;truing a &s;tatute is in the Judges; for they have authority over all laws, more e&s;pecially over &s;tatutes, to mould them ac|cording to rea&s;on and convenience to the be&s;t and true&s;t u&s;e."</P>
<P>HERE the author refers to Hobart, Plowden, and Lord Coke, who fully ju&s;tify the doctrine he advances. They are upon the table, and will be produced, if your Honours require it; but we pre&s;ume it would be only tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon your patience, too much exhau&s;ted already, by a tedious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;atisfaction you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s upon this head, enables us to pur&s;ue the &s;ubject in another point of view. Per|haps there is not a civilized country on earth, where &s;o &s;mall a portion of natural liberty is given into the &s;tock of political &s;oci|ety, as by the people of this State. There is a certain period in every year when the powers of government &s;eem to expire; for the authority of the old officers cea&s;es with the appointment of the new, and the&s;e cannot act until they are commi&s;&s;ioned and &s;worn. The Legi&s;lative of one Hou&s;e being compo&s;ed of new members, or members newly elected twice in the year, feels and carries into effect the &s;entiments of the people, founded upon the ex|tremes of liberty. The electors in the re&s;pective towns have generally &s;ome point to obtain; or, which is more unfriendly to public liberty, they are divided by parties, and &s;o the members elected become the advocates of local, intere&s;ted mea&s;ures, with|out comparing them with the more exten&s;ive objects of the com|munity. The &s;e&s;&s;ions &s;eldom exceed the limits of a week: New laws are propo&s;ed, acted upon and adopted, according to the fir&s;t or the preconcerted impre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion, without time for deliberation or reflection. The Upper Hou&s;e, it is true, hath a negative upon the Hou&s;e of Deputies; but they never per&s;i&s;t in exerci&s;ing it without endangering their next election. The appointment of the Judges, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and
<PB N="34" REF="020825_0037_0FB0F906B45FF198">
other officers of government, being made by the members of both Hou&s;es in a Grand Committee, is very often the re&s;ult of political arrangements; and more attention is paid to the carry|ing of certain points, than to the qualification of the candidates; &s;o that the people feel no great re&s;traint from this quarter.</P>
<P>WHAT is there then, in the nature of our government, to prevent anarchy and confu&s;ion on the one hand, or tyran|ny and oppre&s;&s;ion on the other?&mdash;Before the revolution, the King, as Supreme Executive, formed the balance; but &s;ince, the Executive Power hath become blended with the Legi&s;lative, and we have not, like the other States in the union, adopted any &s;ub&s;titute for this defect.</P>
<P>THE moment therefore that this Court feels it&s;elf dependent upon the Legi&s;lature, in the exerci&s;e of its judiciary powers, there will be an end of political liberty: For there is not an in|dividual of mankind but wi&s;hes, if po&s;&s;ible, to be exempt from the compacts that bind others. And there may be conjunctures in which the love of natural liberty will bid defiance to the re|&s;traints of law, if the Legi&s;lature are blindly guided by the ge|neral impul&s;e. Or &s;hould the&s;e attachments be more &s;trongly fixed to the intere&s;ts of a few de&s;igning men than to the public wi&s;h, tyranny would &s;pring out of anarchy. In either ca&s;e, the interpo&s;ition of the Judiciary may &s;ave the con&s;titution, at lea&s;t for a time; and, by averting the immediate evil, will give &s;cope for reflection, and &s;o prevent a di&s;&s;olution of government.</P>
<P>IT is extremely to be regretted, that this Court is not as in|dependent in the tenure by which the Judges hold their com|mi&s;&s;ions, as they are in the exerci&s;e of their judicial proceedings. The frequent changes that ari&s;e from annual appointments may have an influence upon legal deci&s;ions, and &s;o de&s;troy that uni|formity which is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to the &s;ecurity of individu|als. But from the&s;e con&s;iderations we have nothing to fear upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion: For the knowledge, the integrity, the firmne&s;s of the Bench, will ri&s;e &s;uperior to every ob&s;tacle; and

<HEAD>The CASE of the JUDGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;equences of the foregoing determination were immediately felt. The &s;hops and &s;tores were generally opened, and bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;umed a chearful a&s;pect. Few were the exceptions to a general congratulation, and lavi&s;h indeed were the prai&s;es be&s;towed upon the Court. The dread and the idea of informations were bani&s;hed together, while a mo&s;t perfect confidence was placed in judicial &s;ecurity. The paper currency obtained a more exten&s;ive circulation, as every one found him|&s;elf at liberty to receive or refu&s;e it. The markets, which had been illy &s;upplied, were now amply furni&s;hed, and the &s;pirit of indu&s;try was generally diffu&s;ed. Every pro&s;pect teemed with re|turning happine&s;s, and nothing appeared wanting to re&s;tore union and harmony among the contending parties.</P>
<P>THE demon however of di&s;cord was not entirely &s;ubdued; for upon the next &s;ucceeding week a &s;ummons was i&s;&s;ued from both Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly, requiring an immediate attendance of the Judges, "to render their rea&s;ons for adjudging an act of the General A&s;&s;embly uncon&s;titutional, and &s;o void." Three of the Judges attended, the other two being unwell. This cir|cum&s;tance induced the A&s;&s;embly to di&s;mi&s;s them at that time, but they were directed to appear at the October &s;e&s;&s;ion next following.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY three of the Judges attended, and gave notice in writing to both Hou&s;es, "that they waited their plea&s;ure." They were informed that the A&s;&s;embly was ready to hear them, and would proceed immediately upon the bu&s;ine&s;s for which they were in attendance.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="020825_0041_0FB0F91082642308">CERTAIN ceremonies being adju&s;ted, and the records of the Court produced, the Honourable Mr. Howell, the younge&s;t Ju&s;tice, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the A&s;&s;embly in a very learned, &s;en&s;ible and elaborate di&s;cour&s;e, in which he was upwards of &s;ix hours upon the floor.</P>
<P>HE ob&s;erved, that the order by which the Judges were before the Hou&s;e might be con&s;idered as calling upon them to a&s;&s;i&s;t in matters of legi&s;lation, or to render the rea&s;ons of their judicial determination, as being accountable to the Legi&s;lature for their judgment.</P>
<P>THAT in the former point of view, the Court was ever ready, as con&s;tituting the legal coun&s;ellors of the State, to render every kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Legi&s;lative, in framing new, or repeal|ing former laws: But that for the rea&s;ons of their judgment up|on any que&s;tion judicially before them, they were accountable only to God, and their own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>UNDER the fir&s;t head, the honourable gentleman pointed out the objectionable parts of the act upon which the information was founded, and mo&s;t clearly demon&s;trated, by a variety of con|clu&s;ive arguments, that it was uncon&s;titutional, had not the force of a law, and could not be executed. His arguments were en|forced by many authorities of the fir&s;t eminence, in addition to tho&s;e produced upon the trial. But as this part of the &s;ubject hath in a great mea&s;ure been anticipated, we &s;hall not enter into a further detail, concluding that the legal defence of the Court, in &s;hewing "that they were not accountable to the Legi&s;lature for the rea&s;ons of their judgment," will be more intere&s;ting to the public.</P>
<P>HERE it was ob&s;erved, that the Legi&s;lature had a&s;&s;umed a fact, in their &s;ummons to the Judges, which was not ju&s;tified of war|ranted by the records. The plea of the defendant, in a matter of mere &s;urplu&s;&s;age, mentions the act of the General A&s;&s;embly as "uncon&s;titutional, and &s;o void;" but the judgment of the Court &s;imply is, "that the information is not cognizable before
<PB N="39" REF="020825_0042_0FB0F911F6D3CFF8">
them." Hence it appears that the plea hath been mi&s;taken for the judgment.</P>
<P>WHATEVER might have been the opinion of the Judges, they &s;poke by their records, which admitted of no addition or dimi|nution. They might have been influenced re&s;pectively by dif|ferent rea&s;ons, as the whole act was judicially before them, of which, it being general, they could judge by in&s;pection, without confining them&s;elves to the particular points &s;tated in the plea. It would be out of the power, therefore, of the General A&s;&s;embly to determine upon the propriety of the Court's judgment, with|out a particular explanation. If this could be required in one in&s;tance, it might in all; and &s;o the Legi&s;lative would become the Supreme Judiciary. A perver&s;ion of power totally &s;ubver|&s;ive of civil liberty!</P>
<P>IF it be conceded, that the equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice is as requi&s;ite to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of government as the enacting of &s;alutary laws, it is evident that the Judiciary Power &s;hould be as independent as the Legi&s;lative. And con&s;equently the Judges cannot be an&s;werable for their opinion, unle&s;s charged with cri|minality.</P>
<P>THE nature of their office obliges them to decide upon every que&s;tion that can ari&s;e in legal proce&s;s. If they are not directed by their own under&s;tanding, uninfluenced by the opinion of others, how can they be &s;aid to judge at all?&mdash;The very act of judging, &s;uppo&s;es an a&s;&s;ent of the mind to the truth or fal&s;hood of a pro|po&s;ition. And if a deci&s;ion is given contrary to this a&s;&s;ent, the Judge is guilty of perjury, and ought to be rendered infamous.</P>
<P>EVERY man is excu&s;able for errors of the head, provided &s;ufficient attention hath been paid to the means of information: But no man is excu&s;able for pravity or corruption of the heart.</P>
<P>THE Judges may err: For error is the lot of humanity. Per|fection cannot be required of imperfect beings. But the very idea of being accountable to the Legi&s;lature, in matters of opi|nion,
<PB N="40" REF="020825_0043_0FB0F91441FE3548">
&s;uppo&s;es the Legi&s;lature to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;tandard of perfec|tion. A thought highly derogatory to the attributes of Deity!</P>
<P>THE Judge referred to &s;everal authorities, among which are the following:</P>
<P>BARON Monte&s;quieu, in his Spirit of Laws, ob&s;erves, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 1, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> There is no liberty, if the Judiciary Power be not &s;eparated from the Legi&s;lative and Executive. Were it joined with the Legi&s;lative, the life and liberty of the &s;ubject would be expo&s;ed to arbitrary controul; for the Judge would then be the Legi&s;la|tor. Were it joined to the Executive Power, the Judge might behave with violence and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"THERE would be an end to every thing, were the &s;ame man, or the &s;ame body, whether of the nobles or of the people, to exerci&s;e tho&s;e three powers, that of enacting laws, that of exe|cuting the public re&s;olutions, and of trying the cau&s;es of indi|viduals."</P>
<P>JUDGE Black&s;tone in his Commentaries hath adopted the &s;ame ideas.&mdash;Serjeant Hawkins is preci&s;e and conclu&s;ive, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 H. P. C. c. 1, &s;ect. 17.</NOTE> "that no &s;uch Judge is in any way puni&s;hable for a mere error of judg|ment."</P>
<P><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 H. P. C. c. 72, &s;ect. 6.</NOTE>AND as the law has exempted jurors from the danger of in|curring any puni&s;hment in re&s;pect of their verdict in criminal cau&s;es, it hath al&s;o freed the Judges of all Courts of Record from all pro&s;e|cutions what&s;oever, except in the Parliament, for any thing done by them openly in &s;uch Courts as Judges: For the authority of a government cannot be maintained, unle&s;s the greate&s;t credit be given to tho&s;e who are &s;o highly intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tra|tion of public ju&s;tice: And it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to keep up in the people that veneration of their per&s;ons, and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to their judgments, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to execute the laws with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s, if they &s;hould be con|t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">lly expo&s;ed to the pro&s;ecutions of tho&s;e who&s;e partiality to
<PB N="41" REF="020825_0044_0FB0F915AFAA9B30">
their own cau&s;es would induce them to think them&s;elves in|jured. Yet if a Judge will &s;o far forget the dignity and honour of his po&s;t, as to turn &s;olicitor in a cau&s;e which he is to judge, and privately and extrajudicially tamper with witne&s;&s;es, or labour jurors, he hath no rea&s;on to complain, if he be dealt with ac|cording to the &s;ame capacity to which he &s;o ba&s;ely degrades him&s;elf."&mdash;</P>
<P>COMPARING the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages together, the intention of the au|thor is apparent, that, in the fir&s;t place, the Judges are not an|&s;werable at all for mere error of judgment; and in the &s;econd, they are triable only in Parliament for matters of a criminal nature.</P>

<P>SO tender and delicate is the law in this re&s;pect, that even Ju&s;|tices of the Peace are &s;acredly guarded from every kind of pro&s;ecu|tion upon account of their opinion.</P>

<P>THAT, as one member of the Court, he felt him&s;elf perfectly independent, while moving in the circle of his duty:&mdash;And however he might be affected for the honour of the State, he was wholly indifferent about any con&s;equences that might po&s;&s;ibly re&s;pect him&s;elf.</P>

<SPEAKER>Judge Hazard.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY brethren have &s;o fully declared my &s;entiments upon this occa&s;ion, that I have nothing to add by way of argument. It gives me pain that the conduct of the Court &s;eems to have met the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Admini&s;tration. But their obligations were of too &s;acred a nature for them to aim at plea&s;ing but in the line of their duty.&mdash;</P>
<P>IT is well known that my &s;entiments have fully accorded with the general &s;y&s;tem of the Legi&s;lature in emitting the paper curren|cy: But I never did, I never will, depart from the character of an hone&s;t, man, to &s;upport any mea&s;ures, however agreeable in them|&s;elves.&mdash;If there could have been a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my mind, it mu&s;t have been in favour of the act of the General A&s;&s;embly; but it was not po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the force of conviction. The opinion I gave upon the trial was dictated by the energy of truth: I thought it right&mdash;I &s;till think &s;o. Be it as it may, we derived our under&s;tanding from the Almighty, and to him only are we accountable for our judgment.</P>

<P><PB N="44" REF="020825_0047_0FB0F91EE2F1D4D0">TO the ob&s;ervations of the Judges, &s;ucceeded a very &s;erious and intere&s;ting debate among the members, wherein many argu|ments and ob&s;ervations were adduced on both &s;ides.

<P>THIS was coming to the point, for the obtaining of which the greate&s;t exertions had been made. Candidates were upon the &s;pot ready to fill the &s;eats thus to be made vacant, whom a con|fidence of &s;ucce&s;s had rendered very important.</P>
<P>UPON a que&s;tion of &s;o unprecedented and &s;o intere&s;ting a nature, many of the leading gentlemen of the Admini&s;tration &s;eemed al|mo&s;t ready to yield the ground upon which they had contended.&mdash; Some were for di&s;placing the Judges at all events; &s;ome were for &s;aving appearances by drawing out a conce&s;&s;ion on the part of the Court, and others were determined fully to ju&s;tify them, when the following memorial was pre&s;ented, which gave a new turn to the deliberations.&mdash;</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THIS memorial being received, the Judges informed the A&s;|&s;embly, that they had directed coun&s;el to enforce its contents, and reque&s;ted an hearing accordingly. Whereupon the author, having addre&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e in the u&s;ual manner, ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>THAT the nece&s;&s;ity of exhibiting the memorial upon the table, aro&s;e from the motion la&s;t made by one of their honourable mem|bers, for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the Judges from office, without any previous charge of criminality. A mea&s;ure &s;o novel as this motion tended to produce, could not have been fore&s;een or expected; and there|fore it would not be thought &s;trange if the coun&s;el was not fully prepared to meet and oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>WHAT do the Judges pray for?&mdash;That if they are to be pa&s;&s;ed upon for any thing re&s;pecting their duty, they may fir&s;t know for what offence they are to be judged: That the particular charge or charges may be &s;pecified: That they may have time for defence:
<PB N="47" REF="020825_0050_0FB0F92332F3EA30">
That they may be heard before a tribunal legally con&s;tituted; and that they be heard by coun&s;el.&mdash;</P>
<P>IS there a gentleman in this A&s;&s;embly &s;o inattentive to the rights of his con&s;tituents, as to refu&s;e, upon this occa&s;ion, what the lowe&s;t pea&s;ant, nay the vile&s;t criminal, is entitled to receive?&mdash;I pre&s;ume there is not. And notwith&s;tanding many of them may &s;uppo&s;e that the honour of the Legi&s;lature is wounded by the deci&s;ion of the Court, and &s;o would wi&s;h to re&s;tore it, even by &s;acrificing the Judges; yet I am confident they will not incur the imputation of real di&s;grace, by removing the barriers to per&s;onal &s;ecurity, and the pre&s;ervation of property. For if they would pre&s;erve in the minds of the citizens an attachment to their mea&s;ures, and a veneration for their laws, they certainly will not openly violate the laws them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BE plea&s;ed to recollect a paragraph in our Declaration of Rights, our Magna Charta, wherein it is provided, "that no man, of what e&s;tate and condition &s;oever, &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of his lands and tenements, nor taken, nor impri&s;oned, nor di&s;inherited, nor bani&s;hed, nor any ways de&s;troyed, nor mole&s;ted, without be|ing for it brought to an&s;wer <HI>by due cour&s;e of law."</HI></P>
<P>WAS it in the power of the General A&s;&s;embly to nullify this part of our con&s;titution (which we utterly deny) they have not done it. The right is &s;till guarded by all the &s;olemnities of law, and therefore the honourable remon&s;trants claim and demand its benefits. This they do, from your Honours, not as a Legi&s;lative, but as acting in a judicial capacity. For the pa&s;&s;ing of &s;entence is the exerci&s;ing a judiciary power, grounded upon a pre-exi&s;ting law. You are bound then by that oath, to which you all &s;ub|mitted as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification, previou&s;ly to your becoming members; and which is in the&s;e words: "And you do farther engage equal right and ju&s;tice to do to all per&s;ons that &s;hall appeal unto you for your judgment in their re&s;pective ca&s;es."</P>
<P>IT is perfectly immaterial upon the pre&s;ent argument, whether the judgment of the Court was right or wrong; whether it was
<PB N="48" REF="020825_0051_0FB0F928D64416A8">
agreeably to law, or again&s;t law. The only que&s;tion is, whether they can, in any re&s;pect, be brought to an&s;wer for it, <HI>but by due cour&s;e of law?</HI> And con&s;equently, whether they can be pa&s;&s;ed upon and condemned, until they be proved guilty of a crime?</P>
<P>THE tenure by which all commi&s;&s;ions are held in this State, is for the &s;pace of one year. Con&s;equently, during that term, every officer has an intere&s;t, a kind of e&s;tate, in&s;eparably annexed to his appointment. To be dive&s;ted of which, he mu&s;t either neglect, mi&s;u&s;e, or abu&s;e his tru&s;t, &s;o as to work a forfeiture. This neglect, mi&s;u&s;e, and abu&s;e, include que&s;tions of fact, which mu&s;t appear, either by the confe&s;&s;ion of the party, or by proof, before the forfeiture can be declared. But how can the facts appear to be true or fal&s;e, without an impartial and candid exa|mination? And how can &s;uch examination take place until the facts or charges are particularly &s;tated, and the party accu&s;ed have an opportunity of making defence, in &s;uch way as he &s;hall deem mo&s;t beneficial to him&s;elf?&mdash;Suppo&s;e he &s;hould deny the facts, he mu&s;t certainly be pre&s;umed innocent till the contrary appear. How &s;hall the contrary appear, but by producing evidence, oral or written?&mdash;If oral, hath he not a right to cro&s;s-examine the witne&s;&s;es, to di&s;qualify them, or produce others to di&s;prove their te&s;timony, either by de&s;troying their credibility, or proving &s;ome other proportion totally incon&s;i&s;tent with that a&s;&s;erted by them? &mdash;Or, if the evidence be written, hath he not a right to &s;ugge&s;t and e&s;tabli&s;h alteration, diminution, or even forgery it&s;elf?&mdash;In &s;hort, can there exi&s;t, in contemplation of law, the po&s;&s;ibility of an accu&s;ation, that cannot be controverted, and proved to be groundle&s;s?</P>
<P>DID the Judges hold their commi&s;&s;ions during the plea&s;ure of the General A&s;&s;embly, then indeed they might be removed without the formalities of a trial. But, even in that ca&s;e, the exerci&s;e of &s;o high a prerogative, without &s;ome kind of &s;ugge&s;tion and proof, would be deemed injurious and oppre&s;&s;ive. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, however, wherein the Judges cannot be mole&s;ted, but by being called to an&s;wer for &s;ome crime, <HI>by due cour&s;e of law,</HI> there is not even a &s;ugge&s;tion that they have intentionally
<PB N="49" REF="020825_0052_0FB0F92C5537E668">
departed from the line of their duty. Then are they &s;ecured in their po&s;ts, during the term of their appointment, in as &s;acred a manner as the property of any individual is guarded again&s;t the encroachments of a rapacious neighbour.</P>
<P>THEY &s;tand upon the firm ground of rectitude and indepen|dence. If any man hath any accu&s;ation to exhibit, let him come forth:&mdash;Let him produce the li&s;t of his charges;&mdash;they are willing to meet him. But they will meet him only upon <HI>due and legal proce&s;s,</HI> and before a Court lawfully qualified to try them. Should no &s;uch accu&s;ation be made, what remains but that the Judges be immediately di&s;charged from any farther attendance upon this A&s;&s;embly?</P>
<P>SHOULD they be impeached, I pledge my&s;elf to &s;hew, that they cannot be tried by this Honourable A&s;&s;embly. But if a con|trary &s;entiment &s;hould prevail, I mu&s;t reque&s;t time, till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, to be prepared with arguments and authorities, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a doctrine &s;o important in its con&s;equences. Permit me, however, for the pre&s;ent, to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>THAT in England the Judges are appointed by the King, as the Supreme Executive. Their commi&s;&s;ions are <HI>during good behaviour</HI>; and therefore they are not triable by the King, but by the Parliament only, and <HI>upon impeachment.</HI> Were they to be tried by the King, who appoints them, their judgments might be influenced by his authority; and &s;o the channels of ju&s;tice would be corrupted. Be&s;ides, the King is the party accu&s;ing, and con&s;equently cannot be the Judge. For the very act of complaining, pre&s;uppo&s;es an opinion that the party complained of is guilty. Hence it is that the Grand Jurors, who make pre|&s;entment, are di&s;qualified ultimately to decide upon the fact.</P>
<P>IN this State the Judges are appointed by both Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly, in a Grand Committee. In this re&s;pect, they re&s;em|ble the King; and therefore cannot try the Judges upon a cri|minal charge. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, both Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;em|bly are the party complaining; in this re&s;pect al&s;o, they re&s;em|ble
<PB N="50" REF="020825_0053_0FB0F92DC0CA8B90">
the King, and &s;o cannot be the triers. For, with deference to the Legi&s;lators pre&s;ent, there may be an A&s;&s;embly, who&s;e intere&s;ted views might induce them to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;y&s;tems totally &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution, and of political as well as civil liberty. To effect which, the Supreme Judiciary mu&s;t be the creatures of their power; and &s;uch creatures they would finally be, were the Judges to be appointed, accu&s;ed, and tried by them.</P>
<P>LET the human heart, and, as I have the honour of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to &s;ome who profe&s;s and even attempt to teach the doc|trines of Chri&s;tianity, the con&s;cience al&s;o, be con&s;ulted upon this que&s;tion!&mdash;Should not the parties litigant be equally indifferent to the Judge, who is to decide upon their controver&s;y?&mdash;Why is it that jurors may be challenged, and removed, for favour, but that the mind &s;hould be perfectly unbia&s;&s;ed, and open to the reception of truth?&mdash;Why, like Cae&s;ar's wife, &s;hould they be incapable of being &s;u&s;pected, unle&s;s that the parties them&s;elves might feel a perfect confidence in their Judges?&mdash;Can that con|fidence be placed upon this occa&s;ion?&mdash;Hath not the matter been taken up rather in a political than a juridical point of view?&mdash;I do not a&s;&s;ert; but hath it not been determined, in a convention of part of the members, to remove the Judges, and appoint others who will execute, at all events, the penal acts?&mdash; Hath not one town in particular proceeded &s;o far, as to in&s;truct its Deputies to u&s;e their utmo&s;t influence in bringing the Judges to puni&s;hment?&mdash;Can the&s;e members be con&s;idered as impartial triers?&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, but that the influence of their con&s;tituents will have &s;ome weight in forming their opinion?&mdash; Can they be objected to, as having prejudged the cau&s;e?&mdash;If they cannot, is there not a moral certainty of condemnation? If they can, will not the objection be &s;o far extended, as to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of a legal deci&s;ion?&mdash;</P>
<P>BE entreated therefore, O ye guardians and protectors of the people, &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect upon the magnitude of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, and the important events that may re&s;ult from your determination!&mdash;"The Great Judge of all the earth, can He do wrong?"&mdash;Of beings rational, <HI>He</HI> requires the <HI>"heart."</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="51" REF="020825_0054_0FB0F92F40137478">
And "as a man believeth in his <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> &s;o is he!"&mdash;Submit then to the heavenly &s;tandard! And, as the Judges have acquit|ted them&s;elves <HI>con&s;cientiou&s;ly,</HI> in the &s;ight of God and man, add to the general plaudit, which &s;hall waft their names upon the wings of immortal fame, to the late&s;t po&s;terity!</P>
<P>THE claim and demand of the Judges, as &s;tated in their me|morial, and enforced by their coun&s;el, were followed by a con|ci&s;e, but rational debate, in which the fury of pa&s;&s;ion, excepting in one or two in&s;tances, &s;urrendered to cool reflection, and pre|pared the way for vindicating the honour of the law, and the dignity of the State. In vain did any endeavour to recall the mind to a predetermined re&s;olution! Truth, "which is lodged in a &s;ecret corner of the heart," exerted her gentle influence, while prejudice and malice retired aba&s;hed!</P>
<P>A MOTION was made by an honourable member, &s;econded, and agreed to, that the opinion of the Attorney-General be taken, and the &s;entiments of the other profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen reque&s;ted, whether con&s;titutionally, and agreeably to law, the General A&s;|&s;embly can &s;u&s;pend, or remove from office, the Judges of the Supreme Judiciary Court, without a previous charge and &s;tate|ment of criminality, due proce&s;s, trial, and conviction thereon?</P>
<P>MR. Channing, the Attorney-General, ob&s;erved, that as it was at all times his duty, &s;o he derived a peculiar plea&s;ure in rendering to the Hon. the Legi&s;lature every legal a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power.&mdash;That he attended the trial upon the information, without any bias or partiality upon his mind; and was happy in the conviction, that the whole conduct of the Judges, upon that intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, demon&s;trated the greate&s;t candour and up|rightne&s;s; and, according to his private opinion, their determi|nation was conformable to the principles of con&s;titutional law.&mdash; But, be their judgment agreeably to law or not, confident he was, that there would be a fatal interruption, if not annihilation to government, if they could be &s;u&s;pended, or removed from office, for a mere matter of opinion, without a charge of crimi|nality.&mdash;How that charge &s;hould be preferred and conducted, he

did not pre&s;ume to decide, as it might po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ubject matter of an after que&s;tion, and was not contained in the pre&s;ent order.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE Honourable Mr. Bradford informed the Hou&s;e, that he was not pre&s;ent at the trial in Newport, nor had he attended to the proceedings of the Legi&s;lature re&s;pecting the Judges, excepting &s;o far as related to the citation, and the memorial upon the table: &mdash;That till then, he never doubted but the General A&s;&s;embly were ve&s;ted with con&s;titutional authority to try and remove any officer by them appointed, for any mal-practices in his office; but that from the ob&s;ervations that had been made, he very much doubted the propriety of his former opinion:&mdash;That one point, however, was clear and certain, that as the Judges were commi&s;|&s;ioned and &s;worn for the term of a year, they could not be deprived of their powers during that term, but by regular impeachment, in which the charges again&s;t them mu&s;t be particularly &s;tated; trial, in which they would have an undoubted right for time to prepare their defence, and to be heard by coun&s;el; and condem|nation, upon full proofs of the charges:&mdash;That in the proceed|ings now before the Hou&s;e, there was not a charge, or the appear|ance of one, again&s;t the Court, to which they could, in any man|ner, be held to an&s;wer:&mdash;That he was really a&s;toni&s;hed, that &s;o much time &s;hould be taken up in needle&s;s enquiries, and fruitle&s;s altercations!&mdash;That he had been honoured with a &s;eat, in one or other of the Hou&s;es of the A&s;&s;embly, for upwards of thirty years, and could not recollect a period, in which harmony and unanimi|ty were more e&s;&s;entially wanting than at the pre&s;ent time:&mdash;That the people of this State had been well governed; that they had been an happy people, and might &s;till be as happy as any on earth, if all party contentions could be laid a&s;ide, and every one &s;trive to &s;ooth the cares, and heal the wounds, of his neighbours!&mdash;He be&s;ought, he entre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">d the members to embrace the pre&s;ent mo|ment, in which th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;eemed to be a &s;pirit of conciliation, to put an end to all further contentions among them&s;elves, but what might ari&s;e for the &s;ake of information!&mdash;And, as they regarded the honour, the peace, and the &s;afety of the State, that they would di&s;charge the Judges from any farther attendance, and apply

them&s;elves in earne&s;t, and with one mind, to &s;uch mea&s;ures as would render them happy at home, and re&s;pectable abroad.&mdash;</P>
<P>MR. Helme remarked, that the &s;ubject was new, and he was not fully prepared to give an opinion.&mdash;But that, at pre&s;ent, he inclined to think, that there was no con&s;titutional law by which the que&s;tion could be &s;olved:&mdash;That therefore it mu&s;t be in the brea&s;t of the General A&s;&s;embly to point out the mode of trial by an act for that purpo&s;e, &s;hould a trial be thought nece&s;&s;ary:&mdash; That if they &s;hould proceed to try the Judges, either by them|&s;elves, or a Court to be &s;pecially appointed for that purpo&s;e, they mu&s;t cau&s;e them fir&s;t to be impeached, and &s;tate the facts parti|cularly upon which the impeachment is founded:&mdash;That the common law will direct in the manner of proce&s;s; and &s;hould they be found guilty, they cannot be removed from their office but by a bill, in nature of a bill of attainder, which mu&s;t pa&s;s both Hou&s;es, and be enacted into a law.</P>
<P>MR. Goodwin &s;poke with elegance, and fully acquie&s;ced in the opinions already given, that no &s;entence could be pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Judges, but by regular proce&s;s, in which a &s;pecification of the charges is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite.&mdash;He was diffu&s;ively elo|quent, enlarged upon the &s;ubject, and concluded by ob&s;erving, that he had given his &s;entiments without re&s;erve, and had thought with freedom before he gave them.</P>
<P>THE two profe&s;&s;ional Gentlemen in the Hou&s;e, the Ho|nourable Mr. Marchant, and Mr. Bourne, confirmed the &s;enti|ments of their brethren, in the leading points, by a ma&s;terly di&s;|play of legal talents.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE only que&s;tion remaining was, whether the Judges &s;hould be di&s;charged from any further attendance upon the General A&s;|&s;embly, as no accu&s;ation appeared again&s;t them?&mdash;The que&s;tion was put, and decided by a very great majority, "that as the Judges are not charged with any criminality in rendering the judg|ment, upon the information, Trevett again&s;t Weeden, they are therefore di&s;charged from any further attendance upon this A&s;|&s;embly, on that account."</P>
