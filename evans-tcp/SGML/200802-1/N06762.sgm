<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Inoculation is a very intere&s;ting Affair, and, if prudently ma|naged, may probably become univer&s;al in America, it having been much more u&s;ed of late than ever; what follows, it is hoped, will greatly contribute to pro|mote &s;o u&s;eful a Practice. It is chiefly collected from the late Pieces that have appeared on that Subject; the Authors of which, I am well a&s;&s;ured, are of Cha|racter &s;ufficient to give all due Weight to their Performances; and the other Directions are added by a Per&s;on pro|perly qualified, and are particularly adapted to the Ca&s;es and Circum&s;tances of &s;uch, who have no Practicioner near them, and are &s;ettled too far back in the Country to be able to get the propere&s;t Me|dicines when wanted; which Directions, if well followed, will prepare them &s;o as to have a much greater Chance of having it milder in the natural Way. Therefore I advi&s;e my Readers to keep this little Piece as a Production of great Value, that may even be the Means, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, of pre&s;erving their Childrens Children.</P>

<P>THE Small-Pox, being a Di&s;|ea&s;e &s;o univer&s;ally infectious, and &s;o often fatal to Mankind, has, in every Age, not only engaged the Attention of the able&s;t Phy&s;icians, but induced many of them to favour the World with Di&s;&s;ertations on it; wherein they have given tho&s;e Methods of Practice which they found mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful; and thereby have rendered the Treatment of that Di&s;|ea&s;e, when taken in the natural Way, perhaps, as certain as ever we may ex|pect it will be, allowing for Difference of Climate, and other Circum&s;tances, which require the Judgment of a Phy|&s;ician.</P>
<P>But of all the Improvements, none have been found equal to that of Ino|culation, whereby the Chance in that Di&s;ea&s;e has been found to be, at the lea&s;t, as One to Seventy, and, in &s;ome In&s;tances, as One to Two Hundred, and Two Hundred and Sixty-&s;even;
<PB N="6" REF="008581_0005_102F87E3B1D9C3B8">whereas, in the natural Way, One in Four to Seven have u&s;ually died; and when there has been but One in Ele|ven, it has been thought uncommon|ly favourable, as appears by a Pam|phlet publi&s;hed in England by Doctor <HI>Heberden</HI>; wherein is &s;tated the diffe|rent Calculations made in Bo&s;ton, and other Places in America, and in the Small-Pox and Foundling Ho&s;pitals in London.</P>
<P>Since the Small-Pox la&s;t appeared among us, within the&s;e two or three Years pa&s;t, more have been inoculated here, and in the neighbouring Provin|ces, than is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been from the fir&s;t Settlement of them, and with amazing Succe&s;s, con&s;idering the Malignity of it in the natural Way.</P>
<P>As it was not doubted but &s;ome Pre|parations of Mercury &amp; Antim. were the principal Medicines u&s;ed, which was confirmed by the Manner of Ope|ration of &s;uch as were given by tho&s;e who pretended to the grand Secret,
<PB N="7" REF="008581_0006_102F87E72E1A98D8">every one u&s;ed &s;uch Preparations and Combinations thereof, as his own Jud|ment directed; all concurring in one Thing, to prepare, not only before, but al&s;o between the Inoculation and Eruption; endeavouring thereby to counteract the variolous Venom in the Beginning of its Operation on the Blood, and thus &s;ea&s;onably prevent tho&s;e direful Effects it produces, which often terminate in Death.</P>
<P>What tho&s;e Medicines are, where|with Patients may be be&s;t prepared, and the Manner of admini&s;tring them, are extracted from two late Publica|tions.&mdash;The fir&s;t of which directs:</P>
<Q><P>The Night before you inoculate, give a few Grains of Calomel, well levigated with a like Quantity of diaphoretic Antimony, unwa&s;hed; proportioning the Quantity of Ca|lomel to the Con&s;titution of your Patient; from four Grains to ten for a grown Per&s;on, and from one to three for a Child, to be made up
<PB N="8" REF="008581_0007_102F87E94C32FC60">in a Bolus, or &s;mall Pill, with a little Con&s;erve of Ro&s;es, or any common Syrup. The next Morning give a Purge of the Pulvis Cornachini, made with equal Parts of diaphoretic Antimony, Scammony, and Cream of Tartar. Repeat the Bolus or Pill three Times, that is, once every other Night after Inoculation, and on the fifth Day give a Do&s;e of Boer|haave's Golden Sulphur of Antimo|ny; about four Grains of it for a grown Per&s;on, with two or three Grains of Calomel, made into a &s;mall Pill, will operate both as a Vomit and Purge at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>In the intermediate Days, give two or three Papers of the following Powders, viz. Diaphoretic Anti|mony, ten Grains; Sal Prunel, &s;ix Grains; and Calomel, one Grain, mixed together, for a grown Per|&s;on; and about one fourth Part of a Paper for a Child. The&s;e Pow|ders are to be continued until the Variolous, or Small-Pox Fever is over.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008581_0008_102F87EBB815B638">It appears, by the neare&s;t Calcula|tion, that, under this Treatment, there has not died more than one Per&s;on in 700, and in general, the Di&s;temper is very light, not above one in an Hund|red has it full; when, in the common Way of Infection, one dies out of five.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd of the&s;e Publications, the Method is thus:</P>
<Q><P>Take of Calomel, finely levigated, two Parts; Sulphur Aurat. Anti|monii, one Part; and with a &s;trong Solution of Gum Arabic, or Tra|gacanth, make into a Ma&s;s of Pills; which, for Di&s;tinction Sake, I will call the Mercurial or Antimonial Pill.</P>
<P>Take of Stib. Nitrat. or unwa&s;hed diaphoretic Antimony, Cremor Tar|tar, Sal Polychre&s;t, and Flor. Sul|phur, of each equal Parts; mix and make a refrigerant Powder, of which 30 or 40 Grains is a Do&s;e for an Adult.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008581_0009_102F87ED4E763988">
Take the Powder of Jalap; Scam|mony, Stib. Nitrat. and Cremor Tartar, of each equal Parts, mix and make a purging Powder.</P>
<P>The Day before Inoculation, give two Scruples of the purging Powder, with five Grains of Mer|curius Dulcis, to Adults, and to others in Proportion to their Age. The Night after Inoculation, give a Do&s;e of the Mercurial Pill (which is ten Grains, or twelve, if robu&s;t, to an Adult, dimini&s;hing according to the Age, &s;o as to give to one from nine to twelve Months two Grains) and repeat it three Nights &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively. The Morning after the third Pill, give a &s;econd Purge; after which repeat the Pills 2 or 3 Nights and then the Purge again. The Pill frequently purges and vomits the fir&s;t Time of taking it. Every Morning, including the Day of In|oculation, give a Do&s;e of the re|frigerant Powder (except the Day the Purges are admini&s;tred) conti|nuing them till the Eruption.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008581_0010_102F87F197CCAE90">But finding that the Pill was full &s;trong, even for tho&s;e of &s;ix Months, I gave the following Powder, viz. of te&s;taceous Powder, and Nitrum Stibiatum, each Half a Drachm; of Cinnabar of Antimony and Ca|lomel, each ten Grains, mix and rub them into a fine Powder, of which give eight Grains to a Child of &s;ix Months, and four or five Grains to one of &s;ix Weeks or two Months old: And to promote a little Puking, I add to their Purges, which &s;hould be Rhubarb and Ca|lomel, a &s;mall Quantity of Sulphur Aurat. Ant. e. g. Half a Grain for one of &s;ix Months old.</P>
<P>Sometimes a univer&s;al Ra&s;h ap|pears with the Fever, and alarms tho&s;e concerned very much; but it rather portends Good than Ill, and need not be regarded, unle&s;s attend|ed with other known bad Symp|toms, and then Vene&s;ection may be proper, even to Infants. I have generally u&s;ed the Powder for Child|ren
<PB N="12" REF="008581_0011_102F87F39F14D920">in the Form above&s;aid, but have occa&s;ionally varied the Proportions a little. I have to &s;ome u&s;ed only the Pills and Purges, with equal Suc|ce&s;s. I am al&s;o fully &s;atisfied, that it is a Matter of Indifference, whe|ther the Inci&s;ion in the Skin, and the infectious Lint placed therein, be large or &s;mall.</P></Q>
<P>The Authors of both the&s;e Methods agree in Bleeding, once or twice, tho&s;e that are of a full Habit of Body, with|in the fir&s;t eight Days, viz. on or about the Day of Inoculation, and the Day you expect them to be &s;eized with the Fever, which is generally the eighth or ninth; and al&s;o in ordering to ab&s;tain entirely from animal Food, and all Kinds of Oil or grea&s;y Sub|&s;tances, Salt, Spice, or Spirituous Li|quors, great Fatigue and violent Ex|erci&s;e, together with all inten&s;e Think|ing, and Application to perplexing Bu&s;ine&s;s. But Vegetables and Acids they may u&s;e plentifully. They &s;hould not be clo&s;ely confined, except when
<PB N="13" REF="008581_0012_102F87F5305D60D0">the Air is cold or moi&s;t; and when the variolous Fever comes on, they &s;hould be kept rather cool than hot. Let their Drinks be cooling, ace&s;cent and laxative, e&s;pecially Tartar Whey.</P>
<P>If their Mouths and Throats &s;hould be &s;ore, give them a Tea&s;poonful of Flour of Brim&s;tone, in&s;tead of the re|frigerant Powder, for two or three Times.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they begin to complain, they &s;hould bathe their Feet in warm Water, for ten or twelve Minutes, Morning and Evening (till the Erup|tion is compleat) and if the Head is much affected, bleed them in the Arm or Foot, and apply emollient Poult|ices of Bread and Milk, and a little Oil or Hog's Lard, to the Feet.</P>
<P>If they &s;hould be co&s;tive during the eruptive Fever, e&s;pecially if very delirious, or have Fits, give an open|ing Cly&s;ter once or twice a Day, till tho&s;e Symptoms are removed.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="008581_0013_102F87F88C862570">The following general Rules for Inoculation, nece&s;&s;ary to be known, are chiefly taken from Dr. Heberden.</P>
<P>All Sea&s;ons of the Year are equally proper. There is certainly this Ad|vantage attending warm Weather, that it allows us to keep the Doors or Windows of the Room open, whence ari&s;es &s;uch a con&s;tant Renovation and Purity of the Air, as abundantly makes Amends for all the Inconve|niencies ari&s;ing from Heat. On the other Hand, the Di&s;advantages at|tending Winter, may be &s;ufficiently remedied by Fires, and the&s;e too will help to make the Air of the Room con&s;tantly fre&s;h; but avoid keeping &s;o great Fires as to heat the Room very much.</P>
<P>Children are very &s;ucce&s;sfully ino|culated at a Month or &s;ix Weeks old; and there is a particular Advantage in their undergoing it while they are at the Brea&s;t, as they make no Difficulty of Sucking; and the Milk is the be&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="008581_0014_102F87FBDD469160">Food and Phy&s;ic which they can take. From the Time of their being weaned to the tenth Year, every Year &s;eems equally proper.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t ten Years, every Year is, perhaps, better than the fol|lowing one; though Inoculation may always be practi&s;ed with great Ad|vantages over the other Ways of re|ceiving the Small-Pox, at all Ages.</P>
<P>Breeding Women &s;hould, on no Con&s;ideration, be inoculated, unle&s;s we can &s;uppo&s;e an ab&s;olute Certainty of their catching it in the common Way. It is thought of no great Con|&s;equence, whether the Per&s;on from whom the Matter is taken, has few or many, a good or bad Sort; though Prudence would direct to take it from as good a Sort as po&s;&s;ible. The pro|per Time for taking the Matter is ju&s;t before it begins to dry; opening the Pu&s;tule with a Lancet or Needle, and drawing a Thread or Piece of Lint along one, or more, if nece&s;&s;ary, till it
<PB N="16" REF="008581_0015_102F87FDA6A03AB8">is well wetted with the Matter that ouzes out, and then put into a little Box to dry; it will be &s;tiff, if proper|ly &s;oaked in the Matter. About half an Inch of &s;uch Thread will be &s;ufficient for the Operation, which is performed by making a &s;light Inci&s;ion through the Skin, till Blood appears, on the Out&s;ide of the Arm, about the Middle between the Elbow and Shoulder, long enough to put the Thread in, and cover it with a Bit of any &s;tiking Plai&s;ter, over which a &s;mall Compre&s;s and Roller is proper to keep it on. After a Day or two the Thread may be removed, and the Plai&s;ter conti|nued or not, ju&s;t as you plea&s;e. But when it begins to inflame, which it does as the Fever comes on, then ap|ply a fre&s;h Plai&s;ter daily, of Diapal|ma, or &s;uch like; and if it &s;wells and grows very hard and red, wa&s;h it with warm Milk and Water, and apply a Poultice of Bread and Milk twice or thrice a Day, till the Pock is turned a few Days, and then u&s;e the Plai&s;ter again till it is well; if it keeps an
<PB N="17" REF="008581_0016_102F88002BA73B60">open Sore a Week or two, it is the better.</P>
<P>During the eruptive Fever they may lie in Bed (if they choo&s;e it) but &s;hould not be covered hot; or it may be be&s;t only to lie on the Bed, and lightly cloathed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">If a Vomiting, which is u&s;ual at this Time, &s;hould be exce&s;&s;ive, a few Grains of Ipecacuana given as a Puke, will check it the mo&s;t effec|tually.</NOTE>, drinking plentifully of Barley Water, Sage and Balm Tea, or Toa&s;t and Water, with Tamarinds; and, when filling, let them u&s;e Milk and Water, Panada, Sagoe, Chocolate, Gruel, Puddings, Greens and Roots. If they are a little co&s;tive while the Pock is filling, it is no great Matter, &amp; may generally be prevented by drink|ing warm Small Beer, eating a roa&s;ted Apple, or a few Tamarinds now and then; but if very co&s;tive, at the Turn of the Pock, an opening Cly&s;ter of Water-gruel or Milk, with a Spoonful or two of Mela&s;&s;es and Oil in it, will be proper every Day or two. As &s;oon
<PB N="18" REF="008581_0017_102F8802AEB76578">as the Pox are dry they &s;hould be purged three or four Times, at two or three Days Di&s;tance, with the &s;ame Purges as at fir&s;t: And if a Cough or &s;ore Eyes &s;ucceeds, bleeding will be proper.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, if the Chance were only as two to one in Favour of the Practice among Children, would it not be &s;ufficient to induce a tender Pa|rent to lay hold of the Advantage? But when it is &s;o much greater, as it appears to be by the&s;e Accounts (in &s;ome even as Thirty to One) &s;urely Parents will no longer refu&s;e to accept and thankfully u&s;e a Di&s;covery God in his Mercy has been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s Mankind with; whereby &s;ome Check may now be put to the Ravages that cruel Di&s;ea&s;e has been accu&s;tomed to make, and the human Species be again &s;uffered to increa&s;e as it did before the Small-Pox made its Appearance.</P>
<P>The above Account of Inoculation, Manner of performing the Operation,
<PB N="19" REF="008581_0018_102F88065E8A6BA0">&amp; Method of Treatment, while it tends greatly to encourage it, and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who are inclined, is mo&s;tly adapted to tho&s;e who are &s;omewhat ver&s;ant in Practice, or are near enough to &s;ome publick Places where they can be &s;up|plied with the nece&s;&s;ary Medicines, and timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in Ca&s;e of Dan|ger, &s;hould they have Re&s;olution &s;uf|ficient to perform it them&s;elves.&mdash; But there are many Parts of this Country where they neither have any Practicioner near them, nor can be &s;upplied with Medicines, but tho&s;e of the mo&s;t ordinary and common Sort; by which Means they are not likely to get their Families inoculated by others, or to do it them&s;elves; either for Want of Re&s;olution to perform it, or admi|ni&s;ter the Medicines, if to be got; or perhaps from Prejudice and real Scruples of Con&s;cience. To &s;uch, it is thought, &s;ome familiar Method propo&s;ed might be of more Service than a long Di&s;&s;ertation on Inocula|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="008581_0019_102F8808654DD1E8">Let it therefore be ob&s;erved fir&s;t, that tho&s;e who are likely &s;oon to be &s;eized with the Small Pox in the na|tural Way, from its being in the Neighbourhood, or in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, &s;hould follow, as near as they can, the Directions before given, as to their Diet, Drinks, Air, Cloathing and Ex|erci&s;e, both before, and at the coming on of the Fever, by which their Hu|mours will be kept in &s;o temperate a State, as greatly tends to prevent the bad Symptoms, and dangerous I&s;&s;ue of the Di&s;ea&s;e. And then, as to Me|dicines, it will be proper to u&s;e, before they are taken ill (if they have timely Notice to prepare for it) all, or as ma|ny of tho&s;e before mentioned for in|oculated Per&s;ons, as they can obtain, or have Re&s;olution to give, only with this Difference, that after every three Pills and a Purge, they may intermit three or four Days, and then begin again, and &s;o go on till they are &s;eized, or the Di&s;ea&s;e gone out of the Neigh|bourhood. But if they cannot get
<PB N="21" REF="008581_0020_102F880AD3AB2800">the&s;e Medicines, or dare not u&s;e them, then let them take an Ounce of AEthi|ops Mineral (which may be bought cheap at any Apothecary's) and divi|ding it into 8 Parts, give to a grown Per&s;on one eighth every Night, going to Bed, in Mela&s;&s;es, Honey, or Sugar and Water, and next Morning a Tea|&s;poonful of Flour of Brim&s;tone, or Cremor Tartar, or both mixed, if to be had. But if only one of tho&s;e three Things is to be got, then take the Quantity of that one afore&s;aid, Morn|ing and Evening; and every five or &s;ix Days take any Purge <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e that live by the Sea, perhaps a Pint of Sea Water would be as good a Purge as any.</NOTE>, if it works upwards and downwards the better. But if neither of the&s;e can be got, which probably may be the Ca&s;e, far back in the Country, then it is advi&s;ed (what is frequently kept in the Coun|try for the U&s;e of the Cattle) to take &s;ome common crude Antimony, in as fine Powder as po&s;&s;ible <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Unle&s;s extremely fine, will have no Effect.</NOTE>, and com|mon
<PB N="22" REF="008581_0021_102F880E96A4EBB8">Brim&s;tone in Rolls or Lumps, rubbed al&s;o into fine Powder, of each of the&s;e &s;eparate, or of both mixed, let a grown Per&s;on take a Tea&s;poonful every Morning and Evening, and a Purge once a Week. Thus much for Preparation before the Di&s;ea&s;e. But when taken ill, it is proper, as &s;oon as you can, to bleed all who are above the Age of Children, or have not been much weakened by &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e; and to give for Drink &s;uch Things as have been already mentioned, or as many of them as can be got, e&s;pecially Tartar Whey, which is made by putting two Tea|&s;poonfuls of Cremor Tartar, powder|ed, into a Pint of boiling Milk, and then adding as much boiling Water, and when &s;trained, drink frequently of it; or, if this cannot be had, then give, in&s;tead of it, Rennet Whey, with half Water, or, what is thought better &s;till, Whey made by turning Milk with Vinegar, and then diluting
<PB N="23" REF="008581_0022_102F8811227AFB08">it with Water, &s;ufficient to make it palatable to the &s;ick Per&s;on, keeping the Body open, in the fir&s;t Fever, with Cly&s;ters, and nouri&s;hing it while the Pock fills, with Milk, Panada, Gruel, and &s;uch like; not forgetting to purge when the Pock is dried, and bleed al&s;o, if a Cough or &s;ore Eyes remain.</P>
