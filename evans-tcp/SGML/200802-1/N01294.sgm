<P>THE Eternal GOD, for whom, and by whom all things in the World were made, and are pre|&s;erved and governed, having in his everla&s;ting Coun&s;el (not|with&s;tanding the Primitive Apo&s;tacy and Revolt from Him, fore-known to Him with all His Works from the beginning of the World) purpos'd from the Ruins of fallen

man, to take out of them a People for his Name, and to reduce them to Subjection and Obedience to Him, from whom they had re|volted; that they might &s;hew forth, &amp; might be to the Prai&s;e of the Glory of his Grace: was plea&s;ed accordingly to pitch upon his ble&s;&s;ed SON, to be the great undertaker in this Matter, and called therefore <HI>the Captain of their Salvation,</HI> Heb. 2.10. Appointed to bring the Children unto Glory. Chri&s;t Je&s;us being therefore deputed to this difficult task, the de&s;ert of Sin was &s;uch, and the Ju&s;tice of God &s;o immutable, that there was no way to bring the matter to an i&s;&s;ue, but by the Death &amp; Sufferings of the Lord Je&s;us; Sin being &s;uch a crime and offence again&s;t the Crown of Heaven, that without &s;uitable Satis|faction made to Divine Ju&s;tice, the honour of Gods Law and Government could not other|wi&s;e be upheld and maintained in the World: Chri&s;t Je&s;us having therefore con&s;ented here|unto, and willing to a&s;&s;ume that Nature which had Sinned, and to offer up Him&s;elf a Sacrifice to &s;atisfy Divine Ju&s;tice, it was very congruous to Divine Wi&s;dom, that for &s;o deep a Humiliation He &s;hould have as illu&s;trious an Advancement, and a peculiar Honour con|ferred

upon him, &s;o as to be made King and Lord of all, and have a <HI>Name given Him a|bove every Name,</HI> and &s;uffer fir&s;t, and &s;o enter into Glory; according to the Prediction of the Prophets, and by Chri&s;t applyed to Him|&s;elf, <HI>Luk</HI> 24.25. It being that which he Prayes for, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.5. That the Glory which he had, as to his Divine Nature, with God from Eternity, might be communicated &s;o to his Humane Nature, as that his whole Per&s;on might be glorious, and by that way have a joynt Rule with God over all the Works of his hands, which as in other Places of Scripture, &s;o particularly is plainly hinted in the Book of <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> and e&s;pecially in this <HI>P&s;alm</HI> where the Text lyes: the two great Truths re&s;pecting the Humiliation and Suffe|rings of Chri&s;t, and his Exaltation afterward being exactly Predicted by the Spirit of God, for the directing and &s;trengthning the Faith and Hope of the Church of God in all Ages of the World. This <HI>P&s;alm</HI> is a Prophetical P&s;alm, and &s;hould the que&s;tion be asked as was by the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> Act 8.34. <HI>Of whom &s;peaks the Prophet this, of him&s;elf, or &s;ome other man?</HI> It mu&s;t be under&s;tood of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> in whom many of the Pa&s;&s;ages were literally accom|pli&s;hed;

as appears by comparing it with <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.35, 46. &amp; <HI>Joh.</HI> 19.24. The former part of the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> holding forth his Humilia|tion, and the latter part hinting out his Exal|tation, and gracious Promi&s;es made to Him in this E&s;tate; and is a Prophe&s;y of the En|largement of his Kingdom by the acce&s;&s;ion of the Nations from one end of the World to the other, who &s;hould remember, and turn to him. The words may be con&s;idered as a Prophe&s;y, and a Promi&s;e made to Chri&s;t, for his incouragement in di&s;patching that ardu|ous affair he was intru&s;ted withal. And al&s;o it implies a &s;trong Obligation on the ends of the World, <HI>to Remember and turn to the Lord</HI>; and the more effectually to per&s;wade them &s;o to do, we have laid down in the latter part of the ver&s;es read, a mo&s;t undeniable argu|ment, <HI>For the Kingdom is the Lords, and he is the Governour among the Nations.</HI> Now this Kingdom of Chri&s;t admits of a two-fold con|&s;ideration; The fir&s;t is that Univer&s;al King|dom by which Chri&s;t, together with the Fa|ther and Holy Gho&s;t, reigns over all things; this being common to every Per&s;on in the God-head. And Chri&s;t on this account hath power over all fle&s;h, and <HI>He is King of Nations
<PB N="5" REF="001541_0007_0FB3AAB75DC0A360">
as well as Saints.</HI> And &s;econdly, there is a &s;pecial peculiar Kingdom which Chri&s;t exe|cutes over his Church, his Mediatory King|dom, by &s;pecial di&s;pen&s;ation committed by the Father to him over the Hearts and Con|&s;ciences of men to bring the Soul to a free, and voluntary Subjection to him, hinted in <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 110.3.</P>
<P>But its the fir&s;t of the&s;e two, which &s;hall e&s;pecially be taken notice of, not wholly ex|cluding the other; the univer&s;al Kingdom and Government, common to the whole God-head. There being but One GOD, though Three Per&s;ons, and all equal in Power and Glory: This Truth therefore as it hath re|lation to the calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and a par|ticular reward promi&s;ed to Chri&s;t. I &s;hall wholly wave any further con&s;ideration of, and the Rea&s;on given in the Twenty-eight Ver&s;e, is that I &s;hall principally confine my Di&s;cour&s;e to. In which Ver&s;e, we have a&s;|&s;erted the Univer&s;al Kingdom of the Lord, and his Government of all the Nations in the World: The de&s;ign of this Di&s;|cour&s;e being to per&s;wade, and if po&s;&s;ible to prevail with us in the&s;e ends of the World to a humble &s;ubjection and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the

Sovereign Government of GOD, who&s;e we are, and whom we ought to Serve, and in all things readily obey.</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
GOD the Lord (or Chri&s;t Je&s;us) is certainly the King and Supreme Governour among the Na|nations of the World, and ought to be Remem|bred, and acknowledged as &s;uch by all; and e&s;pecially by His Profe&s;&s;ing People, at what end of the World &s;o ever by His Providence they are ca&s;t, and placed to dwell in.</P>
<P>This Truth is that, which we find &s;o often a&s;&s;erted, and by irrefragable arguments de|mon&s;trated, &s;o univer&s;ally implanted in the light al&s;o, and law of Nature, that without offering violence to Rea&s;on, and blowing out this candle of the Lord the Spirit in man; all mu&s;t yield to the belief of it: If we own there is a GOD in the World, we mu&s;t cer|tainly own Him as the King and Governour of it; it is what we are taught in the <HI>Lords Prayer, Thine is the Kingdom the Power and the Glory,</HI> Mat. 6.13. And which every one, every day ought to &s;ay, <HI>Amen</HI> unto. That which
<PB N="7" REF="001541_0009_0FB3AABBC3A161E0">
<HI>David,</HI> that great King over I&s;rael, did mo&s;t readily in his Life, and at his Death humbly acknowledge, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.11, 12. And that he held his Crown from him; all his Victo|ries over the Nations were &s;uch as God gave him, who was exalted as head over all. How often in the P&s;alms do we find <HI>David</HI> owning and proclaiming this Truth? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 47.2, 7. <HI>&amp;</HI> 66.7. <HI>&amp;</HI> 103.19. It's one of the Royal Titles given to God, That He is the <HI>Mo&s;t High, P&s;al.</HI> 83. <HI>ult.</HI> God is the Supreme: Other Per&s;ons may be high in their Stations and Po&s;ts of Honour, which Providentially they are advanced to; but the Title really of the Mo&s;t High belongs peculiarly to God alone; &s;o he is called by <HI>Abram, Gen.</HI> 14.18. Power and Highne&s;s is originally and funda|mentally in God. He is a <HI>Great King,</HI> Mal. 1.4. <HI>The Only Potentate,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.15. But not to &s;pend time in averring a Truth &s;o plainly demon&s;trated, and which I hope none need to be taught, by the terrible works of God, as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was, by turning him <HI>a grazing among the bea&s;ts, till &s;even times pa&s;&s;ed over him, that he might know that the Mo&s;t High rules in the Kingdom of men,</HI> Dan. 4.32. I &s;hall therefore di&s;patch in a few
<PB N="8" REF="001541_0010_0FB3AABD358F8470">
Propo&s;itions this Truth, and illu&s;trate the &s;ame by a few Conclu&s;ions re&s;ulting from them, for the clearing up of the &s;ame, in or|der to the Application of the whole, and to conclude all with all convenient brevity.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>God the Lord is certainly con|cerned in, and about the affairs of all Nations, all the World over.</HI> And here we may con|&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Being and Con&s;titution of Nations is really from God.</HI> The wi&s;e God, though he had the re&s;idue of the Spirit, and could at once, if he had &s;o plea&s;ed, made the whole Stock and Race of Mankind, and repleni&s;h'd the Earth with a &s;ufficient Number of Inha|bitants, as God did do at the Creation of &s;ome parts of the World; yet notwith&s;tanding He cho&s;e rather to di&s;play his manifold Wi&s;dom and Power in this great affair, to frame, and make immediately but One Man, and One Woman, de&s;igning from that One Stock, all Mankind &s;hould be Propagated, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.26. Of one Blood, from one Family, all &s;hould have one Father, be all Adams Children, who was to be the repre&s;entative of all his Seed: Whereas among the Angels the Inhabitants
<PB N="9" REF="001541_0011_0FB3AABEB3E54740">
of the Highe&s;t Heaven, God made the whole number at fir&s;t; and in the Starry Heaven, God at once garni&s;hed them with tho&s;e Lights which continue to this day according to his Ordinance: but in this lower World it is otherwi&s;e. All came from du&s;t, in a lit|tle time God had a multitude of Nations in the fir&s;t Age of the World before the Flood; and afterward when they were brought to Eight Per&s;ons in the Ark, yet God in a few years repleni&s;hed the Earth, and from tho&s;e three Sons i&s;&s;ued a multitude of Nations; it was the ble&s;&s;ing Promi&s;ed to <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> 12.2. Though he was but one individu|al, <HI>Of thee, Gen.</HI> 15.5. He was the father of many Nations, they were as the Stars of Hea|ven; in Aegypt, in the &s;pace of Two hundred and fifteen years became a great Nation, &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Males, from twenty years old and upwards.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As God is the Maker of the Nations, &s;o all the Motions of the Nations, are all ordered by God, from one part of the World to another.</HI> We find at Babel, how God by the confu&s;ion of Languages, &s;cattered them up and down, when they were building to prevent their being &s;o &s;cattered, <HI>Gen.</HI> 10.5. And indeed its
<PB N="10" REF="001541_0012_0FB3AAC035AEB0E8">
the Lord who bounds every ones Habitation; In Him we <HI>Move,</HI> as well as <HI>Live, Act.</HI> 17.26. <HI>It is not in man to direct his &s;teps,</HI> as <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.23. Gods ways and thoughts are not as mens; God made for man a large hou&s;e to dwell in, a great body of Earth, though part of it be a Wilderne&s;s, and a barren Land, for the wild A&s;s to dwell in, as we read, in <HI>Job</HI> 39.6. Yet a very great part of it is very fertile, as Aegypt watered by the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Canaan</HI> counted the glory of all Lands, and by God allotted to be the Place of his Peoples abode, <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.8. Though at fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Po&s;terity of Canaan, and improved for many Ages, yet God for the Sins of that People rooted them out, and brings I&s;rael in their room: As God gave them the grant of that Land, &s;o in that grant he &s;ets down their bounds and limits: in <HI>Exod.</HI> 23.31. and <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 1.4. Though I&s;rael po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the whole till Davids time. God is indeed the Lord of the Soyl, and removes Nations as he &s;ees meet. As <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> did by the Egyptians from one end of the Land to another, never in|tending that all the Nations &s;hould be penned up in one Corner of the World, nor drove to|gether in heaps, when he hath room enough
<PB N="11" REF="001541_0013_0FB3AAC2785C96C0">
for all, without encroaching upon one ano|thers Proprieties: He brought up the Phi|li&s;tines from <HI>Caphtor,</HI> and the Syrians from <HI>Kir, Amos</HI> 9.7. Gave <HI>Mount Seir</HI> to <HI>Edom,</HI> would not let I&s;rael di&s;turb him in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. And by the Wi&s;e Orderer of all, it was that this little handful of People came to dwell in this Wilderne&s;s, God moving on the hearts of our Predece&s;&s;ors to leave a fruitful Land, and come to this <HI>Je&s;himon.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>All the Changes that happen among the Nations are all Over-ruled by this God, and Lord of all.</HI> It is the Great GOD who doth mo&s;t certainly order all events, and i&s;&s;ues of affairs which to men, and &s;econd cau&s;es may be unknown and unexpected, yet &s;o brought about, that no man can alwayes fore&s;ee or prevent: Gods Peculiar is that He Him&s;elf is JEHOVAH, and changes not, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.6. There is not the &s;hadow of turning, or any variablene&s;s: but the World is full of chan|ges. It is with Political Bodies as with Bo|dies Natural, at &s;uch times when Per&s;ons have the Fever &amp; Ague, one day &s;ick, ano|ther day tolerably well: and as <HI>Job</HI> &s;peaking of him&s;elf, in his 10. <HI>Chap</HI> &amp; 17. <HI>v. Changes &amp; War are again&s;t me</HI>; is very applicable to Na|tions.
<PB N="12" REF="001541_0014_0FB3AAC3EF97B358">
God &s;ometimes ble&s;&s;es a Nation with a great deal of Pro&s;perity, &s;ome con&s;iderable time: at another time, vexes them with all manner of adver&s;ity. In <HI>Solomon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ime, I&s;ra|el had very happy dayes: as we read 1 <HI>King.</HI> 4.25. I&s;rael dwelt &s;afely, every man under his vine; and it was durable all the dayes of <HI>Solomon</HI>; &s;o that there was no adver&s;ary, or evil occurrent, as Solomon acknowledges to <HI>Hiram,</HI> 1 <HI>King</HI> 5.4 But as &s;oon as <HI>Solo|mons</HI> head was laid in the du&s;t, what an ama|zing change and turn of affairs, Ten tribes re|bel again&s;t the hou&s;e of David, and <HI>Solomon</HI> with all his Wi&s;dom could not prevent it, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 12.15. God gave up <HI>Rehoboam</HI> to &s;o fooli&s;h and fatal a mi&s;take, as to alienate the very hearts of his Subjects from him; &amp; what abundance of changes in both the Kingdoms fell out, the Hi&s;tory of their Reigns in Sa|cred Writ do abundantly evince: And indeed Nations are very prone to tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t the Lord, and change their glory for that which doth not profit, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.11.

Ho&s;.</HI> 4.1, 2. We read, <HI>of a Sinful Nation, I&s;a.</HI> 1.4. <HI>&amp; Jer.</HI> 7.28. <HI>This is a nation that obeys not the voice of the Lord</HI>: and this will cau&s;e God to take other mea&s;ures, and vex &s;uch with all manner of adver&s;ity, as we find, in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.5, 6.

He can draw out his Sword out of the Sheath of his Patience, give it a large commi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s through a Land; and its God alone who can give quiet|ne&s;s. How much of Gods Sovereignty is &s;een in this matter in the times of the Judges? the Land &s;ometimes re&s;ted many years, but they had al&s;o long times of Servitude. And indeed in our times, what Multitudes of changes have pa&s;&s;ed over us? and what a long calami|tous War have we laboured under? As from the Heathen behind us, tho&s;e pricks &amp; thorns left to prove &amp; afflict us by; and al&s;o a Fo|reign Enemy: and it mu&s;t be God only that makes Wars to cea&s;e, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 46.9.

<P N="4"><PB N="14" REF="001541_0016_0FB3AAC70AD20500">4. <HI>The Government of the Nations is mo&s;t certainly Ordered by this God and Lord of all.</HI> As God hath made the Nations of one bloud, &s;o he hath and doth take care in his Provi|dence, that all may be under rule &amp; govern|ment; and as he hath given Laws, and gene|ral Rules to all, &s;o He is plea&s;ed to Set up Per&s;ons, who &s;hall be entru&s;ted in a great mea&s;ure, with the Execution of them; and to govern men by men, putting that honour on &s;ome to Rule, &s;o on others to obey, and be Ruled by them; Civil Government being cer|tainly Gods Ordinance, to be ob&s;erved in his Realm every where.

But our holy Chri&s;tian Re|ligion hath taught us a better way; let us be the more thankful to God for his holy Ora|cles, and &s;tudy to do our part, and duty of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every Ordinance of man for the Lords &s;ake, who is our King, and Lives for ever, though &s;uch as are &s;ent by him, may &amp; will die like men.</P>

But God doth it as an Act of favour, to put honour on the Creature, as in his Pre&s;erving Providence He often u&s;es In&s;truments, not out of nece&s;&s;ity, as when he imploys the poor Widow of <HI>Zarephath,</HI> to take in his Prophet to her Table, but puts a &s;ingular honour on her, and &s;ends Him&s;elf Provi&s;ion enough for both of them; &s;o it is al&s;o in his Governing Providence, God u&s;es In&s;truments, but it mu&s;t alwayes be remembred by &s;uch as Rule for Him, and &s;uch as are to be Ruled by them, That God is the Supreme, and his Laws and Rules mu&s;t be by both, carefully ob&s;erved and kept, and its God who concurs with the In|&s;truments; and without Him the builder builds in vain and the watch-mans care would be in&s;ignificant; God never therefore gives Commi&s;&s;ion to any, but he gives and limits their Commi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch particular In|&s;tructions as He &s;ees meet.

<P>Conclu. 1. <HI>God the ab&s;olute Supreme Law|giver,
<PB N="19" REF="001541_0021_0FB3AACE98244C40">
as He is the Governour of the Nations, &s;o He gives Laws to all of them, to Regulate all Per&s;ons in all their Actions.</HI> In all Govern|ment, there is a Legi&s;lative Power; and in <HI>Judahs</HI> ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.10. The <HI>Scepter,</HI> and <HI>Lawgiver</HI> are joyned together; and the Church very readily owns this Lord of all, to be her <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> as he was her <HI>King, I&s;a.</HI> 33.22. And its an argument u&s;ed by the Apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> to di&s;&s;wade Per&s;ons from rigid cen&s;u|ring and ra&s;h condemning of men for tho&s;e things which the Law doth not condemn in them, becau&s;e there is One Supreme univer&s;al Lawgiver, who can directly bind mens Con|&s;ciences, and make Laws for their Souls, and is able to Save, and to de&s;troy mens Souls, which no other Lawgiver can do, <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.12. This God hath his Throne prepared in the Heavens, and is &s;o repre&s;ented as Sitting on it, <HI>Rev.</HI> 4 21.

<P>Conclu. 2. <HI>God having therefore in his own hand drawn up a body of Laws, hath been plea|&s;ed to proclaim and declare to man, what is his great duty, God expects from him; and what God hath revealed, ought carefully to be &s;tudyed and practi&s;ed.</HI> Promulgation of Laws, being what is ordinarily practi&s;ed in all Govern|ments.

There are indeed <HI>Arcana imperii,</HI> My&s;teries of State, and many Secret events of Providence, which God in his own time will bring to pa&s;s; but the things revealed by God are the proper objects of mans inquiry, &s;tudy and practice. <HI>Micah</HI> 6.8. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee O man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of thee, &amp;c.</HI> At mans fir&s;t Creation, God making of him in His Image, He gave him the full know|ledge

of his Mind &amp; Duty, and by Oral Tra|dition in the fir&s;t Ages of the World, His Law was &s;afely handed down, and communicated by one to another, till God after mans Life was &s;o exceedingly &s;hortned, was plea&s;ed to commit his Laws of the Government to wri|ting, and at Mount Sinai gave the Ten Com|mandments, the Moral Law, to his People, and wrote them on Two Tables of Stone with his Own Finger; as we are certifyed by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> his Secretary of State, <HI>Exod.</HI> 31.18. It being a new Edition of what was fir&s;t given to <HI>Adam,</HI> and an univer&s;al Rule to oblige all Per&s;ons in all Ages to ob&s;erve and do; and in after Ages this God in&s;pired holy Men to write down, &amp; leave upon Record &s;uch Rules, as might be &s;ufficient to make men wi&s;e to Salvation, and compile that compleat Canon, by which men might be throughly furni&s;hed unto every good Work: the Scriptures be|ing tho&s;e Sacred dige&s;ts, where God di&s;covers his Imperial Power, as well as his Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice; and though indeed the Wi&s;e God hath been plea&s;ed to give &s;ome more oppor|tunity to know his Will, than others; yet all have the Light and Law of Nature, a <HI>Law written in their hearts,</HI> as its called, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.15.

<P>Conclu. 3. <HI>As God hath Publi&s;hed the Laws of his Government, &s;o he doth po&s;itively Enjoyn and Command Obedience to all his Laws.</HI> God doth not leave the Creature at liberty, to comply, or not; but layes a &s;trict charge on all, Speaks with authority; and although the Word is &s;ometimes called <HI>Gods Coun&s;el,</HI> and God (tho' the Sovereign Governour) conde|&s;cends to rea&s;on, and debate with poor Mor|tals, makes them Judges as it were in their own ca&s;e, <HI>Micah</HI> 6.3. <HI>&amp; Jer.</HI> 26. <HI>I&s;a</HI> 5.3. Yet it is to convict them of the equity and rea&s;o|nablene&s;s of all his demands &amp; expectations, and the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of their di&s;obedi|ence in any thing there-unto.

In the Le|vitical Law, God enjoyns them to do this and that, <HI>I am the Lord,</HI> Lev. 19.3, 12, 14, 30, 37.

<P>Conclu. 4. <HI>As this God gave us the Copy of his Laws, and enjoyns Obedience to them; &s;o He hath given the highe&s;t Sanction that is po&s;&s;i|ble.</HI> He Promi&s;es the greate&s;t Rewards, to

Satan made the highe&s;t offer to Chri&s;t when he pro|mi&s;ed him the Kingdoms of this World, and the Glory of them; but it was far more than ever he could have made good: The highe&s;t reward men give is &s;ome earthly preferment; but in Gods Government, He will give a Crown which fades not away.</P>
<P>Concl. 5. <HI>In this Sanction, God as he Promi&s;es a Reward of Eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, &s;o he threatens, for contempt of his Laws, he will inflict Everla&s;t|ing Puni&s;hment.</HI> Mat. 25.46. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go into Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment</HI>: God will puni&s;h both here and hereafter.

<P>The equity and rea&s;onablene&s;s of it will appear, if we con&s;ider the following Particu|lars.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on 1. <HI>God by the right of Creation hath a mo&s;t unque&s;tionable title to this Government, and may well challenge it as his due.</HI> The World and Nations in it had never been, if God by his Almighty Power had not given them their Exi&s;tence; It is an argument u&s;ed in all Ages; the Church looks on it as her duty to Serve Him, P&s;al. 100.2, 3 <HI>He made us, and not we our &s;elves</HI>: had the Nations been their own Maker, there might have been &s;ome Pretence not to have &s;erved him; but all mu&s;t acknowledge they have their Being from God; Fear and Wor&s;hip appertains to Him there|fore as his due, who made the Earth by his Power, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.7. <HI>&amp;</HI> 13 <HI>ver&s;es</HI>: He is the Cre|ator of the ends of the Earth, <HI>I&s;ai</HI> 40 28.

to Everla&s;ting,</HI> P&s;al. 90.2.

You have done well to give your Civil San|ction; and if any thing more can be done, it will be very plea&s;ing in the Lords &s;ight, for the Suppre&s;ing tho&s;e gro&s;s Vices which a|bound &s;o much among us. We have indeed good Laws again&s;t Vice and Immorality, but there is certainly a fault among us, that they are not better Executed. I know Coun&s;el|lours, Ju&s;tices of the Peace cannot be every where: God alone is Omnipre&s;ent. I know al&s;o that care is taken, that annually Under Officers, <HI>Grand-jury-men, Tything-men,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tables</HI> are Cho&s;en, and all put under the Oath of God, to inquire after, and not let Criminals go Unpre&s;ented for favour or af|fection;

Let us endeavour to an&s;wer the Character given of <HI>Tychi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, A beloved Bro|ther, and faithful Mini&s;ter of the Lord,</HI> Eph. 6.21. And <HI>Epaphras, Col</HI> 1.7. If God &s;ay to us its <HI>Well Done,</HI> though men &s;hould &s;ay it was <HI>ill done, unadvi&s;edly &s;poke.</HI> We Serve a good God, who will pa&s;s by, what a cap|tious, critical Ear will find fault withall.

We have a great many di&s;orders in Gods Hou&s;e; We want a great deal of Wi&s;dom to know how we ought to behave our Selves in it, our difficulties and di&s;couragements are many; We are expo&s;ed to cen&s;ures and hard Speeches; We live in a time of great Dege|neracy; but nothing mu&s;t daunt or di&s;may us; Let nothing put us, who are the Lords Commi&s;&s;ion Officers, to throw up our Com|mi&s;&s;ion, or lay down our work, till God give us an honourable di&s;mi&s;&s;ion out of the Field at la&s;t. Our Lords Joy will abundantly com|pen&s;ate all our Sorrows and Troubles. But I mu&s;t not enlarge on the&s;e things.</P>
<P>I have only One Word more to the Body of this People&punc; <HI>That they would all Remember and Turn to the Lord.</HI> Own Him as your Lord, Submit readily to His Government, Obey Him in all things, and hearken to His Voice. Let me pray that what ever hath been ami&s;s may be humbly Lamented over, and really and &s;incerely at la&s;t Reformed. I pre&s;ume we have no &s;uch Independents a|mong us, but will mo&s;t roadily Own their great Dependance is certainly on this God for all we need, for Time, and for Eternity.

Let all then &s;hew them&s;elves Loyal Subjects to this Great KING, and Walk &s;uitably as &s;uch: We are now on our good Behaviour, and its only <HI>Quam diu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erint,</HI> that God will own us and ble&s;s us. And here I might bring in all the rea&s;ons of the Doctrine, to be improved as &s;o many Motives to pre&s;s you to a chearful and willing Subjection to this Government; but I &s;hall be too tedious. I have only one more Motive to pro&s;s and compel you to come in; and this is to <HI>Re|member that our Protection and Safety in this day of Trouble, this time of Battel and War, depends mo&s;t certainly on our Obedience</HI>: Kings do protect their Subjects: but a Subject may &s;o tran&s;gre&s;s, as to be Out-lawed by Him: We have mo&s;t certainly done enough to pro|voke the Lord, to do &s;o by us, to Out-law us, and throw us out of His Protection: But God is a Patient, and a good God, but it is our Wi&s;dom not to Provoke Him too far: We are a naked People: What terrible work do the Heathen (a contemptible Enemy as we accounted them,) make among us every Year? How many ever and anon cut off, and de&s;troyed? and how ea&s;ily can God hi&s;s for the fly; to allude to what we find, <HI>I&s;ai</HI>

7.18. That is in the uttermo&s;t part of the Rivers of Aegypt, to come upon us; and the Bee of A&s;&s;yria to infe&s;t our Coa&s;ts? And what this Summer will Produce, we know not: God hath indeed made many gracious Pro|mi&s;es in His Word, but there are Conditions to be performed on our part; and if we re|fu&s;e and rebel again&s;t Him, He will deliver us into the Hands of Men, Proclaim a liberty to the Sword, as He threatned <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> Jer. 34.17. He can break down the Hedge, take away the Wall, let us be a prey to any who will devour us. Let all therefore Remember and Turn: Make God our friend, and He can &s;oon &s;ubdue our Enemies, and turn His Hand again&s;t our Adver&s;aries; He can cau&s;e us to dwell in &s;afety alone, and it then may be &s;aid of us, with which I clo&s;e, as <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.29. <HI>Happy art thou O I&s;rael: Who is like unto thee, O People! &s;aved by the Lord, the &s;hield of thy help, and who is the &s;word of thy excellency: and thine enemies &s;hall be found liars unto thee, and thou &s;halt tread upon their high places.</HI></P>
