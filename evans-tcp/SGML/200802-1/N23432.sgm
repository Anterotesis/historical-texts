<HEAD>A &s;hort account of the ravages of the Yellow Fever, at Newburyport in the year <HI>1796.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the execution done by this di&s;order in that town is, through the kindne&s;s of God, ex|tremely &s;mall compared to its baneful effects in &s;ome of our &s;outhern cities. it yet &s;eems by no means improper to publi&s;h a brief and impartial account of the matter&mdash; Every circum&s;tance relating to this di&s;ea&s;e ought to be recorded and remembered on account of its being very likely that all the experience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in it, will be want|ing to enable us to with&s;tand future attacks from this mortal foe.</P>
<P>Many of our country brethren, who have heard a|larming news of 30, 40 or 50 per&s;ons dying of the yellow fever in a night in Newburyport, will be &s;ur|prized, when they read here that le&s;s than 40 h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e died there with it in the whole; but they mu&s;t re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that 'tis a fact; and one I hope that will make them more cautions for the future about believing fal&s;hoods. They ought to remember that people in the neighbour|ing &s;eaports were intere&s;ted in deceiving them about this matter, and that &s;ome of them have actually much mi&s;repre&s;ented the affair. We mu&s;t however acknow|ledge that many others have done us the ju&s;tice to pro|pagate true accounts from time to time of the &s;ickne&s;s, and our thanks are due to mo&s;t or all the editors of new&s;papers in the States for publi&s;hing the authentic reports of our committee of health.</P>
<P>Whenever a malignant di&s;order has e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf in a populous place, the people will find it to their ad|vantage immediately to organize a committee of health, and to make it the duty of the committee to publi&s;h au|thentic accounts of the di&s;temper. By this mode of conduct, men of &s;en&s;e in the country, who read the public news learn the truth, deal in out to their neigh|bors, and are enabled to contradict the extravagant and exaggerated &s;tories of their more ignorant and &s;uper|&s;titious town&s;men&mdash;'Tis ten times as well to have the truth told in &s;uch ca&s;es, by Tom Wi&s;eman, E&s;q. or Doctor Knowall, as it is to have the alarming reports of Deacon Longface or Dick Kick&s;traw &s;pread abroad. The Papers in Newburyport were too long &s;ilent about the fever, and the town was too long without a Com|mittee of Health.</P>
<P>This Fever in Newburyport was attended by &s;ymp|toms nearly &s;imilar to tho&s;e which attended it in Phila|delphia: it was however more acute here than there in general. There the &s;ick commonly lived from 5 to 8 days, but here their career was often fini&s;hed &s;ooner.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e was new to all our Phy&s;icians, and at fir&s;t their endeavours were crowned with &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s; nor were they at any time very able to beat the enemy e&s;|pecially when not &s;ent for at the beginning of the battle.</P>
<P>Dr. Swett who fell a victim, was &s;eized with vomit|ing, and immediately pronounced his fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. "I (&s;aid he to his amiable con&s;ort) am &s;eized now with a di&s;order that I have been trying to check in others&mdash;I can do nothing for it: nobody in this place can, and I mu&s;t fall by it!" The Doctor's mind at this time mu&s;t have been awfully agitated! An hour before perhaps in per|fect health, with a &s;hining pro&s;pect of thirty happy, un|commonly happy years, and now as certain of dying in a few days, as if his neck had been under a French guilo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne! No language could expre&s;s his feelings! No pen is adequate to the ta&s;k of doing ju&s;tice to the af|fecting, the melancholy &s;ubject! Drop, courteous read|er, drop with me a tear to his memory, and let us en|deavour to be ready to travel after him, through the dark and awful valley, and to hail him triumphantly in the realms of light, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of him who is able to &s;ave. Oh! may his fir&s;t addre&s;s to us, when we quit this tran&s;itory world, be as follows, viz,
<Q><L>You're welcome to the bli&s;sful &s;hore,</L>
<L>Where racking death can kill no more!</L>
<L>Where not a &s;ingle ill can harm you,</L>
<L>And where ten thou&s;and raptures charm you.</L>
<L>You're welcome from the painful &s;trife,</L>
<L>And all the ills of mortal life.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is uncertain whether the fever was imported or took its origin in the town; but 'tis certain that it was &s;eldom or never caught any where only in a &s;mall part of a &s;treet that I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;peak of, and it &s;eems likely that it originated there.</P>
<P>By the be&s;t accounts I can get of the matter it ap|pears that one Mi&s;s Flood, a &s;ervant girl who lived with Mrs. Sally Woodhou&s;e, in Water &s;treet, was the fir&s;t victim among us to this di&s;order. She was &s;eized towards the la&s;t of June, and repairing to her father's hou&s;e in Newbury, died there &s;oon after.</P>
<P>On the 3d of July Mr. Davis Lambert, who lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e that Mi&s;s Flood was &s;eized in, died of the &s;ame di&s;order and on the 5th Mi&s;s Silley in the &s;ame hou&s;e al&s;o died. The di&s;order now began to be con&s;idered as a little alarming, and Mi&s;s Silley was prudently buried without the cu&s;tomary ceremonies, the &s;ame morning &s;he died.</P>
<P>The &s;courge thus got footing in a place rendered by &s;everal circum&s;tances very capable of &s;upporting it. That part of Water-&s;treet of which I am &s;peaking is &s;ituated low, by the Merrimack, while a very con&s;ider|able part of the town is built on higher ground, all a|long at the S. W. of it, which is the point from which the Summer breezes generally come. Thus &s;ituated, it mu&s;t be expected that the air in that part of the town will &s;ometimes in the hotte&s;t part of the year, &s;tagnate, and become extremely unwhole&s;ome; the effluvia from all the filth in the city, S. W. of this &s;pot is naturally wa&s;ted over and hovers there. But be&s;ides the&s;e na|tural di&s;advantages, the people in Water-&s;treet labour|ed under a very formidable one, hatched by an inhabi|tant who paid his life for his inattention. A very con|&s;iderable quantity of the heads and entrails of a kind of fi&s;h were &s;uffered to lie and putrify on a wharf. So in&s;upportable was the &s;tench ari&s;ing from this nui&s;ance that when an officer of Police was appointed, he was not able for love nor money to hire any man to remove it, and was actually obliged to cover it over with earth where ever he found it.</P>
<P>It was yet early in July; full four months longer the fever might naturally be expected to rage with encrea&s;|ing fury! Con&s;idering this that 30 or 40 per&s;ons have died with it is not the wonder; but that at lea&s;t four times as many have not died.</P>
<P>About a week after the death of Mi&s;s Silley, ma&s;ter Arnold died in the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 16th of July Mr. Jonathan Gage was &s;eized &mdash;he recovered; but his wife and a daughter died &s;oon after, and his parents from Bradford having vi&s;ited him during his illne&s;s were infected and died at home, one on the 28th and the other on the 29th of July. On the 19th Mr. Z. Atwood died.</P>
<P>The town now began to be a little more alarmed, and appointed an officer of Police. Many groundle&s;s fears were entertained by many, while others did not take the nece&s;&s;ary precautions.</P>
<P>A girl at Mrs. Atwoods and another at Mr. Gages were the next victims. It &s;eemed now to be time for the &s;urviving part of the&s;e bereaved families to fly from their infected abodes; but they had the hardine&s;s to &s;tay: and what is more &s;urprizing, the lovely Mi&s;s Long now or a little before, flew right to the jaws of death, by going to keep Mr. Gages hou&s;e. On the 15th of Augu&s;t Mrs. Hill died, and on the 16th Dr. Swett took his departure.</P>
<P>On the 20th of Augu&s;t four per&s;ons died of the fev|er, one of which was Mi&s;s Long and another Mr. P. Atwood, who had been only two or three days out of his decea&s;ed brother's hou&s;e. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the hardine&s;s of tho&s;e people who &s;till continued at the in|fected hou&s;es in Water &s;treet, and thought it high time to try to alarm them; fearing among the re&s;t that the lovely Mrs. Atwood would lo&s;e her life 40 or 50 years too &s;oon, and hoping that what I &s;aid to her might have &s;ome effect on others who were in danger, I immediate|ly hove the following note into her hou&s;e, viz.</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Mrs. PEGGY ATWOOD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This lady having took conderable pains to clean&s;e her hou&s;e, thought her&s;elf pretty &s;ecure; but about a week after another of her family, Mr. Stone, was &s;eiz|ed by the iron hands of the fever, and &s;he wi&s;ely fled from his fatal dart. Nothing however could give Mrs. Woodhou&s;e a proper idea of her danger, till it was too late for her to retreat.</P>
<P>Many before the death of Mrs. Woodhou&s;e and many afterwards fled, &s;ome from danger &amp; others from where there was none&mdash;'Tis good however to be careful.</P>
<P>The fever continued with unabating fury through the fir&s;t week of September, it then began to decrea&s;e. Five per&s;ons, of whom we had but little hopes, recov|ered. There were few new ca&s;es, and on the 5th of October not one per&s;on in the town remained &s;ick with it.</P>
<P>The narrow circle in which the adver&s;ary moved, and its very &s;ea&s;onable end are pretty evident marks of the friendly interpo&s;ition of him who lives forever. During nearly the whole &s;ea&s;on he &s;ent us very healthy favourable weather. In July he &s;ent us two &s;howers, in which the rain fell very plentifully, and twice as fa&s;t perhaps as the olde&s;t per&s;on living ever &s;aw it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orne before. The&s;e were probably the &s;ame rains which entirely &s;topped the cour&s;e of the Yellow-Fever in New-York. On the 25th of Aug. he &s;ent us a great &s;hower attended with a very uncommon quantity of lightning; and on the 29th it being &s;o amazing warm that the thermometer &s;tood at 96, he cau&s;ed &s;uch an al|teration in the weather that the thermometer &s;oon al|tered to 64. In the cour&s;e of four days it grew &s;o much colder that it actually froze, and no further north than Port&s;mouth, ice of a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s was &s;een.</P>
<P>From this we ought to take encouragement &s;till to &s;trive, by leading virtuous lives, to &s;ecure the kindly aid of indulgent heaven: or if we believe we cannot do this by any of our own works, let us take care not to draw the vindictive vengeance of an Almighty arm down on our guilty heads, by vicious practices.</P>
