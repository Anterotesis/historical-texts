<P>THAT this Province is in a deplorable Situati|on, none can ju&s;tly deny. How it came to be in &s;uch dreadful Circum&s;tances, is an im|portant Inquiry; and how to REMEDY the Evils we now &s;uffer, is Matter of the highe&s;t Concernment, of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence. Poverty and Di&s;content appear in every Face, (except the Counte|nances of the Rich,) and dwell upon every Tongue. Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, (as Birds leave an inclement Climate) are flying away.&mdash;Children leave their aged Parents and go off among Strangers, Provi&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;carce, few Inhabitants, Taxes high, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Clothing dear, Fuel dear, CREDITORS <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> is our Condition that the Hand cannot feed the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and what is &s;o Rebellious as the Belly!

<P>EVERY one mu&s;t know in a political Sen&s;e, what is here meant by the right Hand, and right Eye, and what they denote in a figurative Sen&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>As our Di&s;temper is not only Violent but Malignant, it therefore requires Means, and Application accordingly.</P>
<P>IF we examine clo&s;ely into the Nature of our Difficul|ties, from what Cau&s;e and Source they Spring, trace them up to the Beginning; We &s;hall find that they are not naturally brought upon our&s;elves, but ab&s;olutely <HI>forced</HI> upon us, by Cunning, and by Power; through Lu&s;t of Power, Lu&s;t of Fame, Lu&s;t of Money; through Envy, Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and <HI>violent</HI> Ambition.

<P>The mo&s;t critical Conjuncture, that ever happened in Favour of this Scheme was, the great Expedition again&s;t <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI>&mdash;the Covetous and Ambitious Sharpers had two Whip Rows in this Game! <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> they knew that a great Sum of Money mu&s;t be Emitted to Negotiate this important Affair; Money is the Sinews of War, the Blood in the Body of Trade, the Merchants Tools; in a Word, <HI>it an&s;wers all Things;</HI> Money mu&s;t be paid for all the Baggage, Cloathing, Tran&s;portation, and the like&mdash;The&s;e material Articles were all in the&s;e Mens Hands, and the&s;e Men knew the Committee of War mu&s;t purcha&s;e the&s;e Stores of them; and for fear the Expedition &s;hould <HI>not</HI> &s;ucceed, and the Parliament at home in &s;uch Ca&s;e Re|imbur&s;e the Government, and &s;o the&s;e Men put to &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> make their Remittance in any thing&mdash;&s;ave <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Country,</HI> which they &s;ometimes loo&s;e by; to prevent the&s;e Things, they demanded a mo&s;t exorbitant a&s;toni&s;hing Price for their Commodities; and as a Salvo, violently exclaimed again&s;t the <HI>Government's Money,</HI> as good for nothing, that it would &s;oon take a Cart Load of it, to buy a Cart Load of Hay!&mdash;But then <HI>Secondly,</HI> in Ca&s;e the Expedition &s;hould &s;ucceed, then it was certain, or more than probable, the Government would be Reimbur&s;ed the greate&s;t Part of the va&s;t

Such is the &s;hocking Language of People in <HI>Agony,</HI> and great Di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;&s;uch ala&s;s is our fatal Ca&s;e!&mdash;We know our Di&s;temper; We know the dreadful Cau&s;es of it; And we now immediately <HI>want</HI> &s;ome able Phy&s;icians, faithfully to pre&s;cribe and admini&s;ter the only proper and effectual MEDICINES, &s;o that we may be healed, and re|cover our u&s;ual State of Health again before we go hence.</P>
<P>This kind of <HI>Plague</HI> of a Di&s;temper, is Imported here, and &s;pread among&s;t us, the Cau&s;es, and In&s;truments that have brought it among&s;t us, are Political and Commercial, through Covetou&s;ne&s;s and in&s;atiable Ambition, from a love of Power, love of <HI>Prerogative,</HI> love of Money. And as the&s;e are the killing Cau&s;es of our CONSTITUTION, we never again can po&s;&s;ibly be made whole, until the&s;e In&s;truments and Cau&s;es are finally removed, and we ab|&s;olutely betake our&s;elves to a proper Regimen, by living regularly, temperately, frugally, u&s;e &s;uitable Exerci&s;e, avoid bad Company, and bad Examples.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing then to be done, is immediately to cut off, and remove <HI>every one,</HI> from any Share, from any Hand or A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Rule and Management of our p&mdash;k A&mdash;s, <HI>that are greedy of Gain;</HI> for we may ab&s;olutely, and forever depend upon it, as an unerring Rule, and Axiom in Politicks, that the Sons of Lucre will forever &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;e all Methods, Schemes and Laws of the G&mdash;ern&mdash;t, that in any manner of way tends to interfere and cla&s;h with their Views of INTEREST: and on the contrary, they will in the mo&s;t eager, cunning and inde|fatigable Manner endeavour to bring about and effect all &s;uch Schemes and Laws, as will in any Shape have a tendency to augment and aggrandize their own Fortunes, for they little regard who <HI>&s;inks,</HI> if they &s;wim. Every Stone they can turn, they certainly will turn, in order to gain their Point, and build them&s;elves up, &s;o as none can throw them down: and they are &s;uch Birds of prey, if they at la&s;t cannot find Carrion enough in one place,

<P>Intere&s;t will not <HI>Lie,</HI> and tho&s;e who are Sanguine, in the pur&s;uit of Gain, Riches, and Power, are dangerous Enemies in publick Councils, and Affairs of Government; GOD Almighty him&s;elf, who made the Heart of Man, and who alone knows it, &s;olemnly cautioned and warned <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to chu&s;e <HI>only &s;uch Men,</HI> into places of Government and publick Tru&s;t, who HATED COVETOUSNESS.</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible for him who &s;eeks, and takes all Methods direct and indirect, to plunder every Body he can; how can <HI>&s;uch an one,</HI> ever admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice? <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin?</HI></P>
