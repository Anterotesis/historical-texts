<HEAD>A SERMON DELIVERED AT THE EXECUTION OF Thomas Powers.</HEAD>
<P>WE are convened this day to be &s;pectators of a mo&s;t &s;olemn and affecting event, the launching of a moral ve&s;&s;el from the land of pro|bation into the boundle&s;s ocean of eternity, and endle&s;s retribution, <HI>never to return.</HI> And whether it will depart, freighted with the love of GOD, pen|itence, faith, and the joys of pardoning grace, as a ve&s;&s;el of mercy, prepared unto glory; or freighted with pride, impenitence, unbelief, and the guilt of unpardoned &s;in, as a ve&s;&s;el of wrath fitted to de&s;truc|tion, is, to us, a matter of dreadful uncertainty.</P>
<P>Such an event mu&s;t deeply intere&s;t the feelings of every benevolent &s;pectator, and produce the mo&s;t &s;ervent prayer, that what &s;hall be &s;aid on the occa&s;ion, may prove a favour of life unto life, and not of death unto death.</P>
<P>As a directory for our thoughts, and the ground of our di&s;cour&s;e, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the following pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture has been &s;elected.</P>
<P>LUKE xxiiid Chapter, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43d ver&s;es.&mdash;<HI>And one of the malefactors, which were banged, railed on him, &s;aying, If thou be Chri&s;t, &s;ave thy&s;elf and us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031657_0003_0FED90F6396BB118">
<HI>But the other an&s;wering, rebuked him, &s;aying&mdash;Do&s;t thou not fear GOD, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condem|nation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And we indeed ju&s;tly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing ami&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And be &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, verify I &s;ay unto thee, To day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred hi&s;tory pre&s;ents to our view, a pa&s;t &s;cene, in all re&s;pects as &s;olemn, and in &s;ome re&s;pects, va&s;tly more intere&s;ting than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The great Redeemer, who was rich, for our &s;ake became poor; that we through his poverty might be made rich. To accompli&s;h the important work of our redemption, he appeared on earth in the like|ne&s;s of man. And according to ancient prophecy, in the la&s;t years of his vi&s;ible re&s;idence among men, the &s;pirit of the Lord God was upon him, and he was anointed to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to tho&s;e that were bound; to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God.&mdash;But although he manife&s;ted the greate&s;t benevolence, both with regard to the &s;ouls and bodies of men, yet his faithfulne&s;s in reproving the wickedne&s;s and hy|pocrify of the Jews, excited their indignation to &s;uch a degree, that nothing would &s;ati&s;fy their malicious de&s;ires, &s;hort of embruing their hands in his blood. With the&s;e malignant feelings, they ince&s;&s;antly &s;ought to en&s;nare and to de&s;troy him.</P>
<P>But here we may ob&s;erve that it was a great part of his errand into the world to die an accur&s;ed death on the cro&s;s; to give his life a ran&s;om for many; for without the &s;nedding of blood, there could be no remi&s;&s;ion. So while the Jews with wicked hands crucified and &s;lew him, they did what God's hand and coun&s;el had before determined &s;hould he done.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031657_0004_0FED90FDCA9D848">
And when the time drew nigh which the Father had appointed, and to which the Son had previou&s;ly con&s;ented, that he &s;hould be made a &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of the world; he was betrayed by one of his own family into the hands of his enemies. And when by art and malice they had obtained again&s;t him an un|ju&s;t &s;entence of condemnation, he was led as a lamb to the &s;laughter, and as a malefactor to the place of execution.</P>
<P>And for the greater reproach and indignity, he was hung between two thieves, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. Their placing him thus, between the two malefactors, was probably, to repre|&s;ent him as the ringleader in mi&s;chief, and the great|e&s;t criminal of the three,&mdash;This will appear further probable, if we con&s;ider, that while the three hung on the cro&s;s together, Chri&s;t was the peculiar object of their in&s;ults. We have no account that one in&s;ulting word was &s;aid to either of the malefactors; but again&s;t the Son of God, the artillery of hell was di&s;charged in the mo&s;t barbarous in&s;ults and reproaches.</P>
<P>They that pa&s;&s;ed by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and &s;aying, Thou that de&s;troye&s;t the temple, and builde&s;t it in three days, &s;ave thy&s;elf. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cro&s;s.&mdash;Likewi&s;e, al&s;o the chief prie&s;ts mocking him, with the &s;cribes and elders, &s;aid, He &s;aved others, him|&s;elf he cannot &s;ave; if he be the king of I&s;rael, let him come down from the cro&s;s, and we will believe him. And when, from angui&s;h of &s;oul, he cried, Eloi, Eloi, Lama&s;abachthani; &s;ome &s;aid he calleth for Elias&mdash;One ran and took a &s;punge, and filled it with vinegar, and gave him to drink; and the re&s;t &s;aid let us be, let us &s;ee whether Elias will come to &s;ave him.</P>
<P>Had Chri&s;t been the greate&s;t criminal who ever &s;uffered an infamous death, their in&s;ulting him thus, in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s, would have been an indelible blot upon humanity. But con&s;idering him as perfect|ly &s;inle&s;s and holy, no wonder that the &s;un refu&s;ed to
<PB N="8" REF="031657_0005_0FED90FC615F1B28">
give them light; that the earth quaked with dire con|vul&s;ions, and the rocks bur&s;t a&s;under with indigna|tion, while &s;uch a horrid deed was perpetrated; &s;uch indignity &s;hewn to him, who was the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding we reprobate the conduct of men on that occa&s;ion, we mu&s;t adore the conduct of GOD. The event, in one view of it, was gloomy and infinitely dreadful; but in another, it was glo|riou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ive of the love of GOD to mankind. It was needful that the Captain of our Salvation &s;hould be made perfect through &s;uffering. It was needful that he &s;hould die that we might live.&mdash;And for this end he came into the world; &s;o it plea&s;ed the Father to brui&s;e him, and to lay upon him the iniquities of us all; that who&s;oever &s;hould believe in his name might have everla&s;ting life. Thus Chri&s;t &s;uffered for &s;ins; the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our attention to &s;ome particulars &s;ugge&s;ted in our text.</P>
<P>We may notice that awful degree of &s;tupidity which appeared in one of the malefactors, in the hour of crucifixion.&mdash;<HI>And one of the malefactors railed on him, &s;aying, If thou be Chri&s;t, &s;ave thy&s;elf and us.</HI></P>
<P>The railing and in&s;ults of the &s;pectators, on that occa&s;ion, was evidential of very great malignity and inhumanity. But the railing of this malefactor not only evidenced his inhumanity, but the mo&s;t &s;urpriz|ing &s;tupidity and hardne&s;s of heart. He him&s;elf was ju&s;t clo&s;ing his &s;tate of probation, and about to enter into the world of retribution. It would he natural to expect, that in &s;uch a &s;olemn and critical moment, his mind would have been otherwi&s;e employed than in inventing raillery again&s;t a fellow &s;ufferer. No words can &s;ufficiently expre&s;s the dete&s;table nature of &s;uch hardne&s;s and &s;tupidity. How much more be|coming a rational creature it would have been, to &s;pend tho&s;e few moments of life, in pouring out his
<PB N="9" REF="031657_0006_OFED9100D5659D88">
foul before GOD, in humble con&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;in, and &s;ervent &s;upplication for his forgiving grace.</P>
<P>It is not &s;uppo&s;able that he arrived at that pitch of &s;tupidity otherwi&s;e than by a long cour&s;e of prac|ti&s;ing iniquity. It is not improbable, that in his younger years, the very thought of &s;uch an infa|mous death would have filled him with fear and trembling, and had a prophet foretold him that in &s;ome future day he would di&s;cover &s;uch &s;hocking &s;tupidity, he would have utterly di&s;believed it; thought it im|po&s;&s;ible, and replied as Hazael did to Eli&s;ha&mdash;Is thy &s;ervant a dog that he &s;hould do this thing!</P>
<P>But by continuing in the practice of iniquity, vi|olating his con&s;cience, and de&s;pi&s;ing reproof, he grew more and more feared, and regardle&s;s of dan|ger, &s;till he would ru&s;h blindly and unfeelingly into the bo&s;om of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Nor is it improbable, that while he pur&s;ued his &s;inful cour&s;e, he found his con&s;cience and his fears of future mi&s;ery, an embarra&s;&s;ment; and to free him|&s;elf from inward angui&s;h, greedily &s;wallowed the doctrine of the sadduces, or &s;ome other &s;entiment calculated to plea&s;e his heart, and to footh his con|&s;cience, while he gave full latitude to his vicious inclinations. And that, becau&s;e he did not like to retain GOD in his knowledge, the Lord in righteou&s;|ne&s;s gave him over to a reprobate mind, and &s;ent him &s;trong delu&s;ions to believe a lie, that he might be &s;nared in the works of his own hands, and finally damned for having plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. And thus, by degrees, he was fitted for de&s;truction. So that when the &s;olemn hour of execution arrived, he could mock at death, laugh at the idea of a future retribution, and &s;pend his expiring moments in rail|ing on him, who alone could &s;ave him from endle&s;s death.</P>
<P>It is common for per&s;ons in the time of youth, and till they become hardened in the extreme, to fancy, that if they have any previous warning re&s;pecting
<PB N="10" REF="031657_0007_0FED9102738CB378">
the hour of death, they &s;hall, a&s;&s;uredly, attend to the concerns of their &s;ouls, repent of their &s;ins, and make their peace with GOD. But from this in&s;tance of the malefactors &s;tupidity, we may &s;ee that there is no certainty that &s;inners will not be as &s;tupid in the hour of death, as in any former period of their lives; and con&s;equently to pur&s;ue &s;inful cour&s;es in hopes of a di&s;po&s;ition to repent, at &s;uch a late period of life, mu&s;t be infinitely hazardous.</P>
<P>We may attend to the temper and conduct of the other malefactor at the &s;ame &s;olemn hour.</P>
<P>While he heard his former companion in wicked|ne&s;s, impiou&s;ly, railing on the Son of GOD, and ma|nife&s;ting his &s;tupidity; his &s;oul was filled with a&s;ton|i&s;hment and contrition. In the mo&s;t &s;olemn, feeling and affecting manner, he rebuked him, Do&s;t thou not fear GOD, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condem|nation?&mdash;And we indeed ju&s;tly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no|thing ami&s;s.</P>
<P>No language could have been more &s;uitable on the occa&s;ion, nor better calculated to have a good ef|fect upon the mind of that hardened wretch; had he not been pa&s;t feeling, he mu&s;t have &s;unk in contrition under the weight of &s;uch a &s;ea&s;onable, &s;olemn, and humble reproof.</P>
<P>The former part of this reproof, will pertinently, apply in many ca&s;es.&mdash;When one per&s;on judges, cen|&s;ures, or rails upon another for crimes, while he him|&s;elf is guilty of the &s;ame or greater crimes; it may be &s;aid to him, Do&s;t thou not fear GOD, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemnation? So when one per&s;on, in a carele&s;s and unfeeling manner, &s;ees another pun|i&s;hed for certain crimes, while he him&s;elf is guilty of the &s;ame, or greater, he might in this language ju&s;tly be rebuked.&mdash;Do&s;t thou not fear GOD, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemnation?</P>
<P>"And is it not to be feared that there are &s;ome per|&s;ons in this a&s;&s;embly to day, to whom the rebuke may be penitently applied;&mdash;Some who are guilty
<PB N="11" REF="031657_0008_0FED910416ACB7D0">
of the &s;ame or greater crimes, than that for which this pri&s;oner is to be executed, and yet are de&s;titute of any proper feelings towards the pri&s;oner, and any &s;uitable contrition for their own &s;ins. To &s;uch we may &s;ay, to &s;uch their own con&s;ciences may &s;ay, Do&s;t thou not fear GOD, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame con|demnation?&mdash;For although their crimes have not been brought into public view, and their per&s;ons con|demned by a Court of Ju&s;tice; yet, they and their crimes are open to the view of GOD, and by his law they are condemned. And they are now pri&s;oners to Divine Ju&s;tice, and on their way to trial and execu|tion; and nothing &s;hort of a cordial repentance, will prevent their receiving a more dreadful puni&s;hment than it is in the power of man to inflict.</P>
<P>In the latter part of this malefactors reproof to his companion, he evidenced the penitent feelings of his heart. He did not, like a &s;elf ju&s;tifying &s;inner, &s;ay, And <HI>you</HI> indeed ju&s;tly, for <HI>you</HI> receive the due reward of your deeds. But like one who was &s;en|&s;ible of his own guilt, and di&s;po&s;ed to condemn &s;in in him&s;elf as freely as in others, he &s;aid, And <HI>we</HI> in|deed ju&s;tly, for <HI>we</HI> receive the due reward of our deeds. It is natural enough for impenitent &s;inners to accu&s;e one another; but while they are di&s;po&s;ed to accu&s;e one another, they are generally di&s;po&s;ed to excu&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The truly humble and penitent are mo&s;t deeply af|fected with their own guilt and vilene&s;s, and di&s;po&s;ed to think others le&s;s vile than them&s;elves. The rea&s;on is this, they have not &s;o clear a di&s;covery of the hearts of others, and the aggravations of their conduct, as they have of their own.</P>
<P>The difference between the feelings of a &s;elf ju&s;|tifying and a &s;elf condemning &s;inner, is &s;trikingly illu&s;trated by Chri&s;t, in the parable of the Phari&s;ee and Publican, who went up into the temple to pray. The Phari&s;ee, unaffected with the wickedne&s;s of his own heart, could draw near and proudly thank GOD that he was not as other men. But the publi|can
<PB N="12" REF="031657_0009_0FED9108A062E4C0">
feeling mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly, his own vilene&s;s, could not &s;o much as lift up his eyes towards Heaven, but, &s;tanding at an humble di&s;tance, &s;mote on his aching brea&s;t, and &s;aid, GOD be merciful to me a &s;inner.</P>
<P>Similar to the feelings of the Publican were tho&s;e of the malefactor, when he &s;aid, and <HI>we</HI> indeed ju&s;tly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds. How &s;uitable were the&s;e feelings for one in his &s;ituation&mdash;and how great the contra&s;t of tempers in the two malefactors!</P>
<P>When the penitent had done his duty, in reproving his companion in &s;in and &s;uffering, and had confe&s;&s;ed his own guilt and ill de&s;erts, he humbly made his &s;upplication to the &s;uffering Redeemer. Lord, re|member me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom.&mdash;This is expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;en&s;e he had of his need of a Saviour; his faith in Chri&s;t as the Me&s;&s;iah; his love to the character of Chri&s;t as Mediator; his wil|lingne&s;s to &s;ubject him&s;elf to Chri&s;t as his Lord, and the plea&s;ure of his &s;oul in committing him&s;elf into the divine hand. While others mocked and derided he was not a&s;hamed to own the Lord, and to call upon his name. And to his humble reque&s;t he received the mo&s;t comforting reply.</P>
<P>Thus we are led,</P>
<P N="3">3d. To con&s;ider the import of the Lord's an&s;wer, to the penitent thief&mdash;<HI>To day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>By Paradi&s;e is doubtle&s;s intended, the heavenly &s;tate; a &s;tate of complete felicity and the highe&s;t enjoyment, exempt from all &s;in and &s;uffering; where the weary are at re&s;t, and the wicked cea&s;e from trou|bling. Every &s;oul being perfected in holine&s;s, is completely prepared to be plea&s;ed with divine govern|ment, and to enter into the joys of the Lord. As they are prepared to enter into the joys of the Lord, &s;o they are prepared to be comforted in each others comfort. And as GOD will never cea&s;e to di&s;play his glory, and as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that Angels and &s;aints will for ever be in a &s;tate of youthful vigor, &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="031657_0010_0FED910BAB9D5FF0">
it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that they will be perpetually growing in knowledge, in holine&s;s and felicity.&mdash;Every employment of the &s;aints in &s;erving the Lord and each other, will afford refined plea&s;ure. As nu|merous as the company of happy beings, &s;o numer|ous are the &s;treams of individual felicity; and the perfection and happine&s;s of GOD, with his innumer|able family, collectively con&s;idered, will be, to every &s;oul, an ocean of delight, without &s;urface, &s;hore or bottom.</P>
<P>Into &s;uch a paradi&s;e of joy un&s;peakable and full of glory, Chri&s;t promi&s;ed the penitent malefactor im|mediate entrance.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer of Chri&s;t naturally leads us to con|ceive, that men have &s;ouls capable of exi&s;tence in a &s;tate of &s;eparation from the body; that this &s;oul is the mo&s;t important part of the man, and that immedi|ately upon the death of the body, the &s;oul enters into a &s;tate of retribution.</P>
<P>There is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that Chri&s;t expected the body of the malefactor would, that day, be with him in Paradi&s;e. Yet, he &s;aid to him&mdash;To day &s;halt <HI>thou</HI> be with me in Paradi&s;e. Which evidently con|veys the idea, that the &s;oul is capable of &s;eparate ex|i&s;tence; likewi&s;e that the &s;oul is &s;o important a part of the man, that it may be con&s;idered as the per&s;on when &s;eparated from the body; and al&s;o, that as &s;oon as the &s;oul leaves the body, or as &s;oon as the body dies, the &s;oul enters into a &s;tate of retribution.</P>
<P>That upon the death of the body, the &s;oul enters immediately into a &s;tate of retribution, is denied by &s;ome who profe&s;s adherence to the &s;criptures as the word of God. But the words of Chri&s;t, under con|&s;ideration, mo&s;t naturally conveys this idea. And &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, are calculated to con|firm us in the belief, that this was really the meaning of Chri&s;t, one or two of which will here be brought into view.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul in his epi&s;tle to the Phlippians mentioned a conflict of de&s;ires in his own brea&s;t.
<PB N="14" REF="031657_0011_0FED910EB4155020">
He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus: <HI>"For me to live is Chri&s;t, and to die is gain.&mdash;Yet what I &s;hall choo&s;e I wot not. For I am in a &s;trait betwixt too, having a de&s;ire to depart and to be with Chri&s;t; which is far better. Neverthele&s;s to abide in the fle&s;h is more needful for you."</HI></P>
<P>Now how can this be reconciled to the idea of the &s;ouls remaining in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility from the death of the body, to the general re&s;urrection?</P>
<P>It, perhaps, will be pleaded that during the time of the &s;ouls in&s;en&s;ibility it has no perception of any thing; and therefore it can perceive no lo&s;s of time. Con&s;equently, it mu&s;t be all one, as to the perceptions of the &s;oul, whether it be one &s;econd, or thou&s;ands of years, from the death of the body, to the &s;ouls entering into Paradi&s;e. And as the Apo&s;tle was, in this world, &s;ubjected to grievous afflictions; and as he expected that, on his fir&s;t perception after death, he &s;hould find him&s;elf with the Lord; he might, with propriety &s;ay, <HI>to die is gain.</HI> To this we may an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. A man may be &s;en&s;ible, before he lies down to &s;leep, that if, in his &s;leeping moments, he &s;hall have no perception or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas, that he can, during that &s;tate, have no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ing of time: yet, while he contemplates the matter beforehand, he will, al&s;o, be &s;en&s;ible that time will pa&s;s, during his &s;leep, whether he &s;hall then be con&s;cious of it or not. And when a man awakes in the morning, he may be con&s;cious that time has pa&s;&s;ed while he was a&s;leep, although he cannot re|collect any perceptions which he had during his &s;lum|ber.&mdash;So if Paul expected that his &s;oul would re&s;t in a &s;tate of total in&s;en&s;ibility from the death of the body to the general re&s;urrection, and that during that &s;tate he &s;hould be uncon&s;cious of the pa&s;&s;ing of time, yet doubtle&s;s, he was &s;en&s;ible that there would be lo&s;s of time during that &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. There|fore, if he did not view &s;uch a &s;tate as nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the &s;oul for future &s;ervices and enjoyments,

as &s;leep is nece&s;&s;ary while the &s;oul and body are u|nited, he mu&s;t e&s;timate living in this world as prefer|able to &s;uch a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility: provided that the happine&s;s he might enjoy in this life, would be &s;uf|ficient in the lea&s;t degree, to overbalance the &s;uffer|ings he mu&s;t endure. For if happine&s;s be at all a de|&s;irable object to be continued in exi&s;tence, in the en|joyment of one degree of real-happine&s;s, is preferable to annihilation, or a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It will be readily granted that Paul's afflictions in the pre&s;ent &s;tate were exceedingly great; but it will not be granted that his afflictions were &s;o great as to overbalance his happine&s;s. For in the &s;ame epi&s;tle, he &s;ays, re&s;pecting him&s;elf, "I have learned in what|ever &s;tate I am, therewith to be content". And in another of his epi&s;tles he te&s;tifies that Godline&s;s with contentment is great gain. It is therefore, ea&s;y to con|ceive that he might enjoy in this world, &s;ufficient de|grees of happine&s;s greatly to overbalance all the ca|lamities to which he was &s;ubjected.</P>
<P>Paul was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that charity which &s;eeketh not her own. He was formed for activity, and to do good and communicate was plea&s;ure to his &s;oul.&mdash;This plea&s;ure he expected he could enjoy while he lived. And to &s;uch a mind the thought of pa&s;&s;ing into a &s;tate of total inactivity mu&s;t be highly di&s;agree|able.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it was Paul's opinion, that the afflictions of &s;aints in the pre&s;ent life, work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; which &s;entiment would be a great &s;upport to his &s;oul under his pre&s;ent trials. We may therefore on the whole, conclude, that had Paul expected, that, at death, his &s;oul would remain for thou&s;ands of years, in a &s;tate of inactivity and in&s;en&s;ibility, he would rather have &s;aid&mdash;<HI>To die is le&s;s, to live is gain.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, already, it ap|pears pretty evident, that the &s;ouls of the righteous, or penitent, immediately after the death of the body, enter into a &s;tate of retribution. And if it be &s;o with
<PB N="16" REF="031657_0013_0FED9114CF923C90">
the righteous, we may expect it will be &s;o with the wicked. If we may &s;uppo&s;e that the penitent go immediately into Paradi&s;e, we may &s;uppo&s;e that the wicked go immediately into hell: And both the&s;e ideas are clearly exhibited in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus.</P>
<P>The beggar died, and was carried by the Angels, not into a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, but into Abraham's bo&s;om. The rich man died al&s;o, and the next news we hear of him, is this. In hell he lift up his eyes, and &s;aw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bo&s;om, and &s;o far was he from being in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, that he cried, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and &s;end Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.</P>
<P>That the wicked are here repre&s;ented as being in hell, and the righteous in heaven, before the judg|ment day, appears evident from the la&s;t petition of the rich man. When he was denied &s;o much favor as one drop of water to cool his tongue, he further reque&s;ted that Lazarus might be &s;ent to his father's hou&s;e to warn his five brethren, left they al&s;o &s;hould come to that place of torment. But after the re&s;urrec|tion the wicked in hell will have no brethren left in this world to need either the dead or the living to warn them.</P>
<P>Our Saviour's an&s;wer to the malefactor, is al&s;o expre&s;&s;ive of the <HI>riches</HI> and <HI>freene&s;s</HI> of Divine Grace in pardoning the penitent.</P>
<P>This malefactor had been a great &s;inner. He had delayed repentance to the eleventh hour, and was ju&s;t about to enter into eternity. He then came to him&s;elf. The feelings of penitence took place in his brea&s;t; the love of God was &s;hed abroad on his &s;oul; he cried for mercy with a humble heart.&mdash;And lo! with what readine&s;s his petition was granted. Although he had been exceedingly guilty in delaying repentance &s;o long, yet no objection was made to his forgivene&s;s and &s;alvation. But &s;aid the all compa&s;|&s;ionate

<P>As there is this one in&s;tance of repentance and forgivene&s;s at the eleventh hour, recorded in &s;cripture, it may afford encouragement to all &s;uch as have delayed to that time. But as there is only this in&s;tance recorded, and as in the &s;ame connexion, there is another in&s;tance of the mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;tupidity at the la&s;t hour, it concerns every one who has now the oppor|tunity to improve an earlier &s;ea&s;on to make his peace with God.</P>
<P>We may now proceed to &s;ome particular ap|plication of the &s;ubject, and improvement of the &s;olemn occa&s;ion, upon which we have con|vened. And here the pri&s;oner claims our fir&s;t attention.</P>

You have been a lover of plea&s;ure more than a lover of God; by yielding to the temptations of Sa|tan, and indulging your own vicious inclinati|on, you have paved the way to an infamous death.

<P>you are &s;oon to appear before another tri|bunal, at which the fate of your &s;oul is to be decided for eternity.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MEN, BRETHREN <HI>and</HI> FATHERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE occa&s;ion on which we are convened has had no precedent in this county, and but very few in the State. And it is devoutly to be de&s;ired that this melancholly event, may have &s;uch a happy influence upon all cla&s;&s;es of people, that a &s;imilar occa&s;ion for convening, &s;hall never be needful.</P>
<P>Although capital puni&s;hments have &s;eldom taken place among us, yet criminal pro&s;ecutions and &s;uch crimes as lay a foundation for them, have of late, been very numerous; which evi|dences a corruption of morals, and growth in wickedne&s;s, and gives rea&s;on to fear that capi|tal puni&s;hments will be multiplied. It may, therefore, be &s;uitable in this &s;erious hour, to bring into view &s;ome things which have influ|ence to corrupt the morals of community; that for the future, we may all be on our guard, and act a faithful part according to our re&s;pective &s;tations and capacities, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice, and a reformation of morals. And con|&s;equently, for preventing a further encrea&s;e of criminal pro&s;ecutions, and capital puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>There are four cla&s;&s;es of citizens who have great influence in regulating, or corrupting the morals of &s;ociety, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;<HI>Rulers, Public Teachers, Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion,</HI> and <HI>Heads of Families.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Rulers.</HI>&mdash;They have va&s;t influence upon the morals of community. When they duly execute their re&s;pective offices, they are mini&s;|ters of GOD for good to the people. They are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.&mdash;So that, while good rulers are in authority, and faithfully di&s;charge their duty, vice hides its
<PB N="22" REF="031657_0019_0FED912723D318C8">
head, and the people rejoice. But when the wicked bear rule, iniquity abounds, and the people mourn. The wicked walk on every &s;ide, when the vile&s;t men are exalted. It is written, Thou &s;halt not &s;peak evil of the ruler of thy people. And we wi&s;h not do it.&mdash;But perhaps we may, for a good end, humbly point out faults, without ju&s;tly incurring cen|&s;ure for &s;peaking evil.</P>
<P>It may, however, be &s;uitable here to ob|&s;erve, that we have great cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s, that we have &s;o many good rules in our land&punc; and e&s;pecially, that we have &s;uch an unble|mi&s;hed and exemplary character as Pre&s;ident of the Nation.</P>
<P>But is there not &s;till &s;ome rea&s;on for mourn|ing on account of deficiencies in our Rulers?&mdash;Are not tho&s;e who may be e&s;teemed good Ru|lers, chargeable with &s;ome deficiency at the pre|&s;ent day?&mdash;Are they not, in &s;ome degree, too negligent of their duties, and too regardle&s;s of the morals of community?&mdash;Are there not &s;e|veral laws in this &s;tate, again&s;t immoralities, which are frequently violated, but &s;eldom if ever executed? <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;Such as re&s;pect <HI>Adultery, Drunkenne&s;s. Tavern Haunting, Idlene&s;s, Gam|ing</HI> and <HI>profane Swearing.</HI> Now, if the laws of the State are, in the&s;e in&s;tances trampled upon with impunity;&mdash;if executive officers are negligent in their duty re&s;pecting &s;uch violati|ons of law, does not this tend to encourage the vicious, and pave the way to capital crimes?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, are there not &s;ome who &s;it as legi|&s;lators, and &s;u&s;tain the office of magi&s;trates, who are notoriou&s;ly vicious in their characters, immoral in their lives, and profane in their
<PB N="23" REF="031657_0020_0FED912C21D9A258">
language!&mdash;Such characters in office, are a real cur&s;e to community. While they thus tram|ple on the laws them&s;elves, are they not guilty of the mo&s;t &s;olemn perjury? And in&s;tead of being a terror to evil doers, are they not ra|ther a terror to tho&s;e who do well?</P>
<P>While they thus encourage vice by their own example, their conduct tends directly to the &s;ubver&s;ion of Government, to the corruption of morals, to the de&s;truction of happine&s;s, to infamous deaths, and the ruin of &s;ouls And were not per&s;ons of this character mo&s;t fearfully hardened, they would blu&s;h whenever they take the &s;eat of judgment, to execute the laws upon others; and like Felix or Bel&s;hazzar, they would tremble at the pro&s;pect of a judgment to come.</P>
<P N="2">2d. PUBLIC TEACHERS are another very influential cla&s;s of citizens. If they preach the go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST, they inculcate the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of morals with which human &s;o|ciety has ever been ble&s;t&mdash;Morals which pro|ceed from the pure&s;t principles, which are en|forced by the highe&s;t motives, and which i&s;&s;ue in the greate&s;t good. And while Mini&s;ters preach as Chri&s;t preached, and walk as he walk|ed, their influence is va&s;tly beneficial to com|munity, as to the regulation of morals.</P>
<P>But if a Mini&s;ter preaches <HI>Benevolence</HI> in words, and <HI>Selfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> in deeds; if he preaches that men &s;hould be ju&s;t and merciful, while his practice encourages di&s;hone&s;ty and incompa&s;|&s;ion;&mdash;if he preaches that men &s;hould be &s;ober and temperate in all things, and yet devotes him&s;elf to di&s;&s;ipation and intemperance; the influence of his example &s;o far over balances the
<PB N="24" REF="031657_0021_0FED912F2F459FA0">
influence of his preaching, that he does much more hurt than good.</P>
<P>Or if a Public Teacher, under pretence of preaching the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, preaches the go&s;pel of Satan;&mdash;if in oppo&s;ition to the go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t, he makes no difference between the holy and profane, the &s;aint and the &s;inner, either with re&s;pect to their characters here, or their rewards hereafter; or if he does not preach that the grace of GOD, which bringeth &s;alva|tion, teaches us that, denying all ungodline&s;s and every worldly lu&s;t, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world;&mdash;but in&s;tead of this, in his preaching and prac|ti&s;e, he tolerates tho&s;e revellings, banquettings, and vain amu&s;ements, which have no re&s;pect to the glory of GOD, the good of the &s;oul, or the benefit of community; it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that while men are lovers of plea&s;ure more than lovers of GOD, &s;uch preaching is calculated to plea&s;e the hearts of the vicious, and to ruin their &s;ouls forever. And it is referred to the judgment of others, whether the corruption of morals is not, in &s;ome degree, to be attributed to the preaching and practice of &s;ome, who profe&s;s to be amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3d. PROFESSORS OF RELIGION, are al&s;o to be con&s;idered as influential in forming the morals of &s;ociety. They are for lights in the world, their conduct is particularly noticed, and has great influence upon the minds of &s;uch as are conver&s;ant with them. When they walk ac|cording to their profe&s;&s;ion, they hold forth the word of life in their morals; as they are con|&s;tant and devout in wor&s;hipping God, &s;o they love one another with a pure heart &s;ervently,
<PB N="25" REF="031657_0022_0FED9130D172EF28">
and walk in wi&s;dom towards tho&s;e who are without. Their morals proceed from that wi&s;|dom which is from above; which is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be intreat|ed full of mercy and good fruits, without par|tiality and without hypocri&s;y. Such morals, every one mu&s;t &s;ee, can do no injury to com|munity.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of religion who are neg|ligent re&s;pecting the word and wor&s;hip of God; who bite and devour one another; who are fordid and a varicious in their pur&s;uits; kna|vi&s;h in their dealings; implacable and unmer|ciful in their conduct; loo&s;e and profane in their language, do va&s;t mi&s;chief in &s;ociety; for, it is natural for carele&s;s &s;inners to re&s;pect profe&s;&s;ors as examples, and to think it lawful for them&s;elves to be le&s;s circum&s;pect than tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be followers of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And are there not, at the pre&s;ent day, many profe&s;&s;ors of religion who are &s;o loo&s;e and care|le&s;s in their morals, that they contribute rather to the increa&s;e of darkne&s;s than light. Are there not many who&s;e morals would be a re|proach ever to a heathen? Many who are &s;o worldly minded that they regard neither ju&s;|tice nor mercy in their pur&s;uits? who not only countenance iniquity in others, but even &s;et the mo&s;t impious examples them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Do not many profe&s;&s;ors of religion, almo&s;t for&s;ake the public wor&s;hip, and in&s;titutions of God. David could &s;ay, I was glad when they &s;aid unto me, let us go into the hou&s;e of the Lord. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord, My &s;oul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the
<PB N="26" REF="031657_0023_0FED9133D9122EB0">
courts of the Lord: For a day in thy courts is better than a thou&s;and. I had rather be a door keeper in the hou&s;e of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>But mu&s;t not many modern profe&s;&s;ors of re|ligion make a great change in this language to repeat it from the heart. Mu&s;t they not &s;ay I was glad when they &s;aid unto me let us go into the hou&s;e of <HI>merriment.</HI> How amiable are thy tabernacles <HI>O Prince of Darkne&s;s!</HI> My &s;oul longeth, yea even &s;ainteth for the <HI>Ball room,</HI> the <HI>licencious tavern,</HI> or the <HI>chambers of re|velling and wantonne&s;s;</HI> for a day in &s;uch <HI>&s;port's</HI> are better than a thou&s;and:&mdash;I had rather be a <HI>door-keeper in the&s;e tents of wickedne&s;s,</HI> than to dwell in the <HI>Hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>It is a common ob&s;ervation, that actions &s;peak louder than words; and it is &s;ubmitted to con&s;cience whether the practice of many profe&s;&s;ors does not clearly expre&s;s the ideas which have now been brought into view.</P>
<P N="4">4th. HEADS OF FAMILIES&mdash;The&s;e are, in a high degree, influential as to the morals of community. The morals of &s;ociety depend much on the education of children. For a ge|neral rule we may &s;ay as Solomon has &s;aid&mdash;Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.&mdash;But the education of children is under the im|mediate direction of parents. Their in&s;truc|tions and examples have va&s;t influence upon their offspring in forming their habits and mo|rals.</P>
<P>If parents were univer&s;ally faithful in the di&s;charge of their duty, in giving in&s;truction, governing and &s;etting good examples, children
<PB N="27" REF="031657_0024_0FED913579FDBFB8">
would, in general, &s;hun immoral cour&s;es, and grow up for u&s;efulne&s;s in the world.</P>
<P>But if parents are irreligious and immoral; if they neglect to give their children good in|&s;truction, and &s;et evil examples before them, and &s;urrender the right of government, or make it &s;ubordinate to the inclinations of children, young people will imbibe vicious habits, fol|low vicious cour&s;es, and grow up for mi&s;chief and de&s;truction. It will perhaps, be &s;aid that &s;ome of the mo&s;t pious and exemplary parents have &s;ome of the mo&s;t vicious children. This may be admitted, and &s;till it is no objection to what has been advanced; for we do not &s;up|po&s;e that the children of good people, are na|turally any better than others, and the good in|fluence of pious parents may be counteracted and &s;ubverted, by the evil influence of wicked parents. As children are naturally inclined to evil rather than to good, they will mo&s;t naturally be plea&s;ed with that mode of family govern|ment, which lays the lea&s;t re&s;traint upon their vicious inclinations. Hence, if a faithful pa|rent u&s;es his endeavours to bring up his chil|dren in the fear of the Lord, and to re&s;train them from vicious cour&s;es; yet if neighboring parents &s;et evil examples, and give unbounded liberty to their children, to gratify their fooli&s;h inclinations, the children of the faithful parent may, by degrees, be drawn away, and be led to think hard of him for laying greater re&s;traints than are laid upon other children; and when they have proceeded thus far, they are in dan|ger of proceeding farther, even to de&s;pi&s;e pa|rental authority, and to ru&s;h, with a feared con&s;cience, into vice and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="031657_0025_0FED913B7B4C7738">
And is it not evident that parents, in general, have become too negligent with regard to the morals of their children? And are there not many to be found, who in&s;tead of training up their children for virtue and u&s;efulne&s;s in the world, do, by the neglect of good in&s;truction, by &s;etting evil examples, and by pro&s;tituting parental affection and authority, train them up as &s;ervants for the Devil?&mdash;Oh! how will &s;uch parents endure the &s;ight of their children at the day of Judgment!</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved that vicious parents counteract the influence of good parents. And we may add, that they al&s;o counteract the in|fluence of good mini&s;ters and good magi&s;trates. They teach children to de&s;pi&s;e religion, and to de&s;pi&s;e government; and vicious mini&s;ters counteract the influence of good magi&s;trates, and wicked magi&s;trates counteract the influ|ence of good mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>How important is it then, that the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es which have been named, <HI>Rulers, Mi|ni&s;ters, Profe&s;&s;ors</HI> and <HI>Parents,</HI> &s;hould all unite their efforts and their influence for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice and the reformation of morals&punc;</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e of us who belong to either of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, duly examine our&s;elves, and be &s;uitably humbled before the Lord. Probably in a greater or lo&s;s degree, we mu&s;t all plead guilty before the bar of con&s;cience, as having had &s;ome &s;hare in corrupting the morals of community, and levelling the high way to the gallows: Let us all feel the importance of uniting our influence for the future, in a cau&s;e of &s;uch con&s;equence to the welfare of &s;ociety, to the lives, and to the &s;ouls of men.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="031657_0026_0FED913D1E73BB08">
Let us be deeply affected with the import|ance of good examples, and the danger of tho&s;e which are evil.</P>
<P>Bad example in community is like the plague in a city, if one is infected, thou&s;ands are en|dangered. The contagion may &s;pread from man to man, from family to family; from town to town; from &s;tate to &s;tate; and it may be &s;hipped and wa&s;ted from land to land.&mdash;It may al&s;o be tran&s;mitted from one generation to another; &s;o that in the cour&s;e of ages and events, the example of one vicious man, may have influence to hurry thou&s;ands up to the gallows, and millions down to Hell. May we all, therefore, in this &s;erious moment re&s;olve, that we will not be the imitators of Jeroboam, the &s;on of Nebat, who made I&s;rael to &s;in.</P>
<P>As the ri&s;ing generation are deeply intere&s;ted in the events of this day, I &s;hall clo&s;e with an addre&s;s to them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY YOUNG FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HERE you &s;ee one, in the bloom of youth, to be this day cut off from the land of the liv|ing, by the judgment of men, and the righte|ous judgment of GOD. The cour&s;e of wicked|ne&s;s which he has pur&s;ued, has led him into the &s;nares of death; &s;oon he mu&s;t bid adieu to all earthly objects, and what will become of his precious &s;oul is known only to GOD.</P>
<P>And think ye that this unhappy creature is a &s;inner above all the young people in the land, becau&s;e he &s;uffers &s;uch things?&mdash;I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e pe|ri&s;h. You may, perhaps, continue impenitent,
<PB N="30" REF="031657_0027_0FED913EC0AFFAC8">
and e&s;cape the county pri&s;on and the gallows&punc; but you cannot continue long in impenitency, and finally e&s;cape the pri&s;on of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>This event is a &s;olemn call to you, to flee youthful lu&s;ts, to &s;hun vicious cour&s;es, to re|pent and make your peace with GOD; and if you make a right improvement of the event, it will be a mean of everla&s;ting benefit to your &s;ouls. The death of this criminal <HI>will</HI> have &s;ome influence on your minds; it will either &s;erve to reform or to harden. This is the re|quirement of God to you this day, both by his word and his providence&mdash;Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth. And you can|not di&s;regard it without greatly endangering your &s;ouls.</P>
<P>It is natural for young people to neglect their &s;ouls, in hopes of a future opportunity to re|pent. If you were &s;atisfied that this day would be your la&s;t, probably, you would be filled with great anxiety&mdash;but you expect to &s;ee this pri&s;oner die, and &s;till live your&s;elves for many years to come. However, there may be le&s;s time between the hour of his departure, and yours, than you now imagine. God has many ways to call mankind into eternity; and it is po&s;&s;ible that the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s of you will be called before this criminal.</P>
<P>But however long you may live, it is not now too early to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and to begin the &s;ervice of the Lord. To delay repentance is very hazardous, even on &s;uppo|&s;ition that your lives &s;hould be long continued. For by delay your hearts harden and become more and more oppo&s;ed to repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="031657_0028_0FED91433A0CC760">
Think &s;eriou&s;ly of the fearful &s;tupidity of the thief on the cro&s;s; how far he was from re|pentance in his expiring moments; you may flatter your&s;elves that you &s;hall conduct more wi&s;ely. But what evidence can you have of it, if you are now &s;o fooli&s;h as to refu&s;e to repent? One delay prepares you for another; and the probability of your ever repenting, grows le&s;s and le&s;s every day; and the proba|bility of your final hardine&s;s and remedile&s;s ru|in grows greater and greater.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem hard to you to for&s;ake your va|nities, and to devote your&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God in &s;o early a period of your lives. But is it not better to do it <HI>now,</HI> than it &s;hould <HI>never</HI> be done. Such may be the determina|tion of GOD, re&s;pecting your repentance and &s;alvation, that it is with you, <HI>now</HI> or <HI>never.</HI></P>
<P>It is probable that you feel pretty confident that you &s;hall never arrive to &s;uch a pitch of wickedne&s;s, as to be expo&s;ed to an infamous death. But who can tru&s;t your hearts? If you have hearts to di&s;obey God now, you have hearts to li&s;ten to the advices of &s;atan, and how far you will fellow them, is not for man to tell. A&s;k the poor criminal whether two years ago, he had any more expectation of coming to the halter, than you have now. If not, your danger may be greater than ever you yet ap|prehended.</P>
<P>If you wi&s;h to be &s;ecured from &s;uch crimes as expo&s;e to &s;uch a death, &s;hun tho&s;e paths which lead to &s;uch crimes. Give up your hearts and your all to God. This is the way of &s;afety, and every other is a way of danger.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="031657_0029_0FED9147B2D13378">
It is much to be lamented that young peo|ple in general have become &s;o regardle&s;s of God, of duty and of danger, and &s;o devoted to carnal and &s;en&s;itive plea&s;ures. It affords but a di&s;mal pro&s;pect with regard to the con&s;e|quences of their living in this world, or their entering into another. For in the time of youth they generally form the characters they &s;u&s;tain through life, and with which they leave the world.</P>
<P>If you wi&s;h to be truly u&s;eful, truly re&s;pect|able, and truly happy in this, or a future world, it will be wi&s;dom in you to devote this early part of life, to forming habits of real excellence. If this cour&s;e &s;hould &s;till be neglected by you, the probability is, that you will be the in&s;tru|ments of much &s;in and mi&s;chief in this world, and the &s;ubjects of much wrath and woe in the world to come.</P>
<P>O think to what eminence &s;ome have arrived in u&s;efulne&s;s and honor in this world, by an early devotion of them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God. Think of Jo&s;eph, of Mo&s;es, David, Jo|&s;iah and Daniel. What a &s;weet &s;avor have they left behind them, and with what honor and re&s;pect will their names be &s;till handed down to unborn ages.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be the &s;tudy of every one to render him&s;elf &s;o u&s;eful in life, that when he dies, &s;ociety may feel that they have lo&s;t a valuable character. And thus their memory will be ble&s;|&s;ed, while the name of the wicked &s;hall rot, or be tran&s;mitted down to po&s;terity, loaded with infamy and contempt.</P>
<P>Your Fathers are dropping away, one after another, and if you live in the world, you mu&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="031657_0030_0FED9149553D39B0">
be their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the great affairs of church and &s;tate. And how intere&s;ting it is that, now in the time of youth, you &s;hould lay a founda|tion to &s;erve your generation by the will of God! In order to, this you &s;hould devote your time and advantages to the noble purpo&s;es of &s;toring your heads with knowledge, and your hearts with the habits of piety and virtue. In &s;o doing you will be prepared for an early death, or a u&s;eful life, and a ble&s;&s;ed eternity.</P>
<P>This &s;olemn &s;cene may well excite your at|tention to one, which is fa&s;t approaching, that is infinitely more &s;olemn, the <HI>Judgment of the Great Day.</HI> When the de&s;pi&s;ed Redeemer &s;hall de&s;cend from Heaven, and appears not as an infamous malefactor, but, arrayed in all the maje&s;ty and &s;plendor of God. When all the na|tions &s;hall be &s;ummoned before his bar, have all their works di&s;played to public view, and every individual receive a &s;entence which will fix his &s;oul in endle&s;s joy, or endle&s;s woe. To this &s;olemn &s;cene you are all ha&s;tening with every breath you draw.</P>
<P>Are you not then, now &s;olemnly called to &s;eri|ous reflections, to &s;erious re&s;olutions, and to a &s;erious deportment. Let me entreat you, in the mo&s;t affectionate manner, to forbear, on this occa&s;ion, every appearance of lightne&s;s and in|decency, and to behave as becomes tho&s;e who expect to &s;tand at the Judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t. If you &s;hould devote this day to &s;port and re|velling, you will greatly expo&s;e your&s;elves to the di&s;plea&s;ure of Heaven;&mdash;give &s;atan a great ad|vantage again&s;t you, and va&s;tly encrea&s;e tho probability that you will finally <HI>die</HI> in your &s;ins. To day then if you will hear the voice of God harden not your hearts; left he &s;wear in his wrath that you &s;hall never enter the man&s;ions of re&s;t.</P>
