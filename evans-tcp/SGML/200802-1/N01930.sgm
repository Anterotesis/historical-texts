<HEAD>Some Remedies propo&s;ed for the Re&s;toring the &s;unk Credit of this Province of <HI>Pen|&s;ylvannia;</HI> with &s;ome needful Remarks on its Trade.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a nece&s;&s;ary and primary Maxim in every Trading Country, <HI>That the Credit of the Country mu&s;t be pre&s;erved:</HI> In do|ing of which two Things are needful;</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Produce and Manufactory mu&s;t be good in their Kinds, and not wanting is Weight or Mea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Pay of the Country ought to be ready and punctual.</HI></P>
<P>So nece&s;&s;ary are the&s;e Maxims to be ob&s;erv|ed in all Trading Countries, that no Country can be found either rich or happy &s;o long as they are neglected. We need go no farther for an Example, than by comparing the <HI>for|mer</HI> with the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> State of this Province. When formerly, the Produce of this Province was preferred before that of <HI>New-York</HI> for its Goodne&s;s, and our Payments at Home ready and punctual, Did any People on this Continent encrea&s;e more in Riches? And who was there then in Trade that did not get E&s;tates? And, where a Country of better Credit? But &s;ince our Produce has de&s;ervedly
<PB N="4" REF="002287_0003_0FDB1A7329AE6900">
got an ill Character in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> by our unre&s;tricted Manner of Bolting; and our run|ning Stock of Money being &s;unk has intro|duced the mo&s;t &s;candalous Cu&s;tom at Home, of endle&s;s Tru&s;t and a beggarly Di&s;count; Where is there a Country more &s;candalous A|broad, and more beggarly at Home?</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every one knows, how &s;hort we fall in ballancing our Trade with <HI>England,</HI> and that if &s;ome Produce or Manufactory could be found to ballance that Trade, the Advan|tage we have in the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade would in &s;ome time procure us a Stock of Running Ca&s;h; but when good Fortune will be plea&s;ed to favour us in this la&s;t Particular, is not po&s;&s;ible for any one at this time to tell, tho' &s;everal Things may be very rea&s;onably of|fered to our Tryal, which we need not neg|lect: But in the mean time the D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Credit of a Country mu&s;t not lie unregarded. Di&s;|ea&s;es, who&s;e Remedies are unknown, are cured rather by Chance than Skill; and there|fore may prudently be left to the Re&s;ult of Time: But Di&s;ea&s;es, who&s;e Cures are known, are not to be neglected. <HI>For,</HI> as one of the Faculty wi&s;ely &s;aith, <HI>every Di&s;ea&s;e is not mor|tal, yet every Di&s;ea&s;e is hurtful; therefore it is highly imprudent not to cure a Di&s;ea&s;e as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>The only Remedies that at pre&s;ent can be propo&s;ed, to re&s;tore the &s;unk Credit of this Province are, what the recited Maxims of all Trading Countries directs us to; which are evidently two, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="002287_0004_0FDB1A74D59C2A60">1<HI>&s;t, That the Commodities we export for the future, be good in their Kinds</HI>; that is to &s;ay, Our manufactured Wheat mu&s;t be &s;o careful|ly in&s;pected, that no Mi&s;take or Trick of Bolters, &s;hall impo&s;e upon us <HI>Cour&s;e Midling</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Fine Flour,</HI> or patch us up an In|voice to couzen the Buyer Fifteen in the Hun|dred; Knaveries too commonly practi&s;ed, to the un&s;peakable Lo&s;s and Di&s;credit of this Province.</P>
<P>We are informed by late Advices from <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> That <HI>New-York</HI> Flour is &s;old for 40 <HI>s. per Barrel, Philadelphia</HI> Flour at 30 <HI>s.</HI> The Rea&s;on for this Difference in the Sales is un|doubtedly the Badne&s;s of our Flour. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Bolters pack up what they plea&s;e, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>New-York</HI> all their Flour is weighed and ex|amined, at an Office appointed for that Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The ill Character our Flour ju&s;tly meets with in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> occa&s;ions Lo&s;&s;es to this Country of many Kinds: As, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The <HI>New-York</HI> Flour being ju&s;tly preferred before ours, is certain to be &s;old fir&s;t; our Ve&s;&s;els do frequently wait till <HI>New-York</HI> Flour is &s;old, or go to another Port. Our Voyages by this Means are rendered long, and con&s;equently more expen&s;ive by &s;everal Pounds <HI>per Cent.</HI> than they need to be. We al&s;o export le&s;s Flour probably by <HI>One Third</HI> than we &s;hould do, were our Flower e&s;teemed equal with theirs of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>Innumerable are the Lo&s;&s;es that flow from hence: Could we &s;ell but a <HI>Fifth</HI> more Flour
<PB N="6" REF="002287_0005_0FDB1A786A555B48">
in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> than we now do, which is the lea&s;t we can &s;uppo&s;e if ours was equal to <HI>New-York,</HI> that <HI>One Fifth</HI> mu&s;t return to us Ca&s;h or <HI>European</HI> Goods: For, as ob&s;erved be|fore, we have the Ballance of that Trade; for which Rea&s;on the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> are obliged to fill up our Accounts with Ca&s;h, or the Produce of &s;ome other Country in Demand with us. Therefore never &s;o &s;mall an Addi|tion to this Trade, would be &s;o much Help towards ballancing our Trade with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s likewi&s;e to ob&s;erve by the by, <HI>That the le&s;s</HI> We&s;t India <HI>Produce <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, the more will the</HI> We&s;t-India <HI>Trade be in Debt to us for ballance:</HI> For which Rea&s;on, the more we di&s;courage the Importation of <HI>Rome,</HI> but more e&s;pecially <HI>Mela&s;&s;es,</HI> the more will the Ballance fall in our Favour. <HI>Me|la&s;&s;es</HI> ought in particular to be di&s;couraged, for it not only in many Ca&s;es di&s;courageth the Rai&s;ing of <HI>Barley,</HI> but the Di&s;tilling of other Spirits, not to be di&s;pi&s;ed; particularly, that from <HI>Apples</HI> and <HI>Peaches,</HI> Liquors capable of Improvements, not inferior to the be&s;t <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Brandy</HI> for whole&s;om and friendly Effects; in many Ca&s;es medicinal, particularly the <HI>Peach-Spirit,</HI> if rightly di&s;tilled.</P>
<P>The 2<HI>d</HI> Thing nece&s;&s;ary for the Re&s;toring the &s;unk Credit of this Province, is, <HI>The Pay of the Country mu&s;t be rendered more ready and punctual than it is at pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>It is melancholly to tell the mi&s;erable Con|dition of this Province, occa&s;ioned by a Neg|lect in this la&s;t Particular. How deplorable
<PB N="7" REF="002287_0006_0FDB1A78EEAA4DE8">
are the Lives of the common People! Their Trades and Callings di&s;couraged and valued at nought: What real E&s;tates they have had are mortgaged, eat out and con&s;umed; and the whole Province look'd upon by all Foreigners, as a Country beggarly and &s;candalous, not worth Trading with. But the melancholly Decay of Credit in this Province requires not much Time to demon&s;trate, for every <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is too &s;en&s;ibly convinced of it; nor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> any farther than into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to convince is that a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Money now wanting is the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">+cay: The common Nece&s;&s;aries for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> brought to the Market are not to be bought, becau&s;e Change (as <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Copper</HI> is com|monly called) is not to be had; all our Do|me&s;tick Trade is become nothing but Di&s;count, <HI>A mi&s;erable Make-&s;hift</HI> good for Nought, but to <HI>enrich</HI> Knaves and <HI>beggar</HI> Fools.</P>
<P>Now to recover a running Stock of Money &s;unk in any Country, the&s;e three Things are propo&s;ed to us.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t, To recover the Ballance of a Trade, which may be &s;aid to be lo&s;t; or, by forcing &s;ome New Trade, where the Ballance may be hoped will fall in Favour of the Country.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To rai&s;e the Price of Silver or Gold; for the&s;e, like other Commodities, will be carried to the be&s;t Markets.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To make Money by Publick Authority, which &s;hall pa&s;s by Virtue of a Stamp impre&s;s'd on &s;ome|thing there to be had, whether it be Pewter, Silver, Spelter, Bra&s;s or Paper, it matters not
<PB N="8" REF="002287_0007_0FDB1A79EE305740">
which, the ready Currency of the Thing is all that is to be look'd to.</HI></P>
<P>And the&s;e three are the only Ways made U&s;e of, to procure a running Stock &s;unk in any Country.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing propo&s;ed cannot be pro|cured in this Province by any Means yet tried. The Second will undoubtedly do &s;omething, though probably too &s;low: But the Third promi&s;es, not only a &s;peedy Recovery of our &s;unk Stock, but likewi&s;e Matters profitable, and highly needful for the Country in gene|ral; which, we hope, will appear by what follows.</P>
<P>But, before we propo&s;e any thing in this Matter, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer &s;ome Objections, that are &s;equently offered again&s;t rai&s;ing a Running Stock after this third Man|ner propo&s;ed; wherein al&s;o, by the by, we &s;hall ob&s;erve the Method and Succe&s;s of other Countries in this Particular.</P>
<P>It is a common Notion of Men unacquaint|ed in Trade, That <HI>Nothing can be made the Running Stock of any Country, but Silver or Gold, without &s;ome Lo&s;s to that Country.</HI> And this is a Mi&s;take &s;en&s;ibly ari&s;ing from a defective Knowledge of what Silver and Gold really is on the one Hand, and the Nature of a Running Stock on the other.</P>
<P>For Silver and Gold has no more Title to be a Running Stock of any Country, than. <HI>John of Nokes</HI> has to be Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI>; they are allowed to be &s;o by the general Con|&s;ent and Choice of a Country, and becau&s;e of
<PB N="9" REF="002287_0008_0FDB1A7EB5CE6A00">
the comparative Value they have above mo&s;t other Commodities: Be&s;ides, their convenient Carriage and ea&s;y Conveyance make mo&s;t Countries choo&s;e them as running Purcha&s;ers of all other Commodities; yet any other Commodity may be made a running Stock as well as the&s;e.</P>
<P>And again: The narrow Notions Men generally have of the Nature of a running Stock, make them &s;uppo&s;e, That nothing can be made the running Stock of any Country without &s;ome Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Was the running Stock of any Country de&s;igned for no other U&s;e than to be exported? Then nothing could be preferred before Silver or Gold, becau&s;e they are in Demand in mo&s;t Countries; and skilful Merchants could &s;ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> ever lo&s;e by them, as they too frequently do by other Commodities.</P>
<P>But as it is mo&s;t evident, That the run|ning Stock is a thing which every Country wi&s;ely covets to pre&s;erve; therefore what&s;o|ever is the Running Stock of any Country, mu&s;t be by <HI>&s;o much</HI> the more valuable, by <HI>how much</HI> it is capable of being confined to the Bu&s;ine&s;s it was de&s;igned for: And herein <HI>Sil|ver</HI> or <HI>Gold</HI> cannot be &s;o certainly confined, as &s;ome other Things in U&s;e may.</P>
<P>But what is the mo&s;t proper thing to rai&s;e a Running Stock of Money in this Province, the Legi&s;lators ought to be the be&s;t Judges: However, we hope to be pardoned, if we take a View of other Countries, what Me|thods they have taken, and what Succe&s;s they
<PB N="10" REF="002287_0009_0FDB1A80A887A410">
have met with in their farther Proceedings in this Affair.</P>
<P>We find it was ever the Opinion and gene|ral Cu&s;tom of mo&s;t Countries, where Gold and Silver was not &s;ufficient to carry on the Dome&s;tick Trade, nothing was equal to <HI>STAMP'D PAPER,</HI> who&s;e indebted Va|lue was &s;ecured to the Receiver by &s;ome cer|tain Fund.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> indeed, by Virtue of a Stamp, impre&s;s'd on a <HI>ba&s;e Metal,</HI> have rai&s;ed a Run|ning Stock of Money, which is frequently im|ported into other Countries; but the intrin|&s;ick Value of this Money is near <HI>One Fifth</HI> &s;hort of the Value it commonly pa&s;&s;eth for. Such a Kind of Money, and &s;ometimes much wor&s;e, have we frequently met with, which, by the Authority of &s;ome Prince or State, has been made current, to &s;upply &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ions. But this Kind of Money being &s;upported only by an ab&s;olute Power, and not by any vi&s;ible Fund, cannot be made but where &s;uch a Power doth pre&s;ide and giveth A&s;&s;ent to the Currency of &s;uch Money: But in little Colonies, at a great Di&s;tance from their Prince, &s;uch Money cannot be expected will be allowed by him to be made.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e, a Piece of <HI>Paper,</HI> &s;tamp'd and figured, not ea&s;ily to be counterfeited, ex|pre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Value</HI> it &s;hall pa&s;s for, (in the Manner and Form hereafter mentioned) and this <HI>Value</HI> &s;ecured to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by &s;ome vi&s;ible Fund, is really a Money not inferior to the be&s;t <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold</HI> for a Dome&s;tick
<PB N="11" REF="002287_0010_0FDB1A826CC95CD0">
Trade, and is evidently &s;uperior to the Money made of <HI>ba&s;e Metals,</HI> &s;upported only by the Authority of one or more Per&s;ons Will and Plea&s;ure, and not by any intrin&s;ick Value or vi&s;ible Fund. But it is as po&s;&s;ible to beat the plaine&s;t Truths into &s;ome Mens Heads as it is to make a Dromedary &s;peak: They readily tell us, That <HI>Paper-Money is nought; It is de|&s;tructive</HI> (&s;ay they); <HI>To all Places, where it comes, it carries away all the Silver</HI>: And thereupon call to evidence (as they weakly &s;uppo&s;e) the ill Fate of <HI>South-Carolina</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>:</P>
<P>But &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Paper-Money</HI> in any Ca&s;e injurious to <HI>South-Carolina</HI> or <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> it would be a gro&s;s Mi&s;take; though it is to be confe&s;&s;ed, that in <HI>South-Carolina</HI> they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">+duced to &s;uch Straits (by their <HI>Indian</HI> Wary <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> pay off Soldiers, and other War-Expences, that they were obliged to make more <HI>Paper-Money</HI> than, in Time of Peace, their Dome&s;tick Trade had occa&s;ion for. And in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> this is the Fault of their <HI>Paper-Money</HI> (if any) they have <HI>too much</HI>; yet can neither the Trade, nor the Silver or Gold of <HI>South-Carolina</HI> or <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> be &s;aid to be le&s;&s;ened one Jot by this.</P>
<P>It is only the Want of a Produce or Ma|nufactury in a Port, to ballance the Trade of &s;ome other Port it deals with, or the low Value is &s;et on Silver or Gold, do carry it out of any Port. As to Trade, a due proportion'd Quantity of <HI>Paper-Money</HI>; who&s;e Value is &s;e|cured, is as far from hurting it, as a Piece of Bread an empty Traveller.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002287_0011_0FDB1A83A9B03208">Since they made <HI>Paper-Money</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> are le&s;s Fi&s;h exported? Or, fewer Ve&s;&s;els built? Do any one refu&s;e to receive their Bills? By what Trade can they po&s;&s;ibly get a &s;ufficient Stock of Silver or Gold, to &s;upply the Coun|try with Running Ca&s;h? And if they can no where command it, as mo&s;t certainly their Trade at pre&s;ent cannot do it What <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they do without Paper-Money? Mu&s;t every Gentleman, Trade&s;man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> turn <HI>Fi&s;h Mer|chant?</HI> What an odd Kind of Running Stock of Money mu&s;t &s;tinking Fi&s;h make? In&s;tead of a Bag, or Pocket, they mu&s;t hire a Cart to carry Home <HI>Fifty Shillings</HI>; and after all, the intrin&s;ick Value of their Running Stock would be daily in Danger of rotting or wa&s;ting &s;ome way or other.</P>
<P>The very &s;ame may be &s;aid of <HI>South Caro|lina</HI>; Doth Paper-Money frighten Silver or Gold from coming among them? Or, are they not uncapable of ballancing the Trade of mo&s;t Money'd Parts? Do fewer Ve&s;&s;els go from thence to <HI>England</HI>? Do not Foreigners receive their <HI>Paper-Money</HI>? O, do any refu&s;e to take it again at the &s;ame Rates it was received? Do any Traders lo&s;e a Farthing by it? And, to conclude, If there was not <HI>Paper-Money</HI> in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> how could the Trade of that Country be &s;o readily di&s;patched as it is?</P>
<P>It is to be confe&s;&s;ed, That one of our Neighbouring Provinces hath met with ill Succe&s;s in their making <HI>Paper-Money</HI>; it &s;unk in its Value: And the Publick Authority ra|ther encouraging this Misfortune, than put|ting
<PB N="13" REF="002287_0012_0FDB1A88584DD128">
any Stop to it, its <HI>Value</HI> entirely vani&s;h|ed, and the whole Country was greatly in|jured by this Misfortune, particularly <HI>Barba|does.</HI> But this proceeded not from any Evil entailed on <HI>Paper-Money,</HI> but the bad Managing of it: For, in the fir&s;t Place, they allowed it not to be (as it ought) a lawful Tender in all Payments; which thing will ever render Paper, or any other Money, in|ferior to that which is unlimited in its Pay|ments. Be&s;ides, Governor <HI>Granvill</HI> imme|diately after being called Home, and having a large Quantity of Paper-Money by him, offered it at &s;ome Di&s;count for Silver-Money. Had none been over-look'd in this wrong Proceeding, none but His Excellency would have been a Lo&s;er, tho&s;e that bought of him would have got by it: But, like Men as ig|norant of their own Intere&s;t, as of the Na|ture of the Money they had made, every one &s;trove who could mo&s;t undervalue it, till at la&s;t, almo&s;t every one had a worthle&s;s Paper left in his Pocket, with the Title of Pounds, though not worth one Farthing.</P>
<P>And this is no other than will happen in Matters of higher Nature, if Laws are made not to be obeyed. Had the Magi&s;tracy timely puni&s;hed &s;uch Per&s;ons as offered to buy or &s;ell at a <HI>lower Value</HI> than what the Legi|&s;lators had authorized the Bills to pa&s;s for, all the ill Con&s;equences would have been pre|vented, and they might have done as much Good to the Country in general, as any Money
<PB N="14" REF="002287_0013_0FDB1A89A55816D0">
not a &s;ufficient Tender in all Payments could have done.</P>
<P>But to propo&s;e the be&s;t and mo&s;t certain Manner of making <HI>Paper</HI>-Money, not in|ferior to Silver or Gold, for the Running Stock of any Country, three Things are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be regarded, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Funds from whence it ri&s;eth; or, more properly, the lands that give it Credit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Manner of pre&s;erving its Value.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The Manner of Sinking it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. One Kind of Fund made U&s;e of to give Credit to a certain Quantity of Paper Money, is, A real Security given for a certain Quan|tity of Bills, at an Office appointed by Pub|lick Authority for that Purpo&s;e; which is no other than like the Manner of mortgaging the E&s;tate of one Neighbour to another; ex|cept that here the Money belonging to the Government, the Intere&s;t becomes the Pub|lick's Advantage. And this publick Way of lending Money has been looked upon of &s;uch Advantage to the Borrower, as well as un|doubtedly it is to the Lender, that private Offices of this Kind have been encouraged; particularly, one at <HI>We&s;tminster,</HI> authorized by Patent, to lend upon Security of Hou&s;e, Lands, Goods, Wares, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Thing of Advantage to the poorer Sort, as well Hou&s;ekeepers as Trade&s;men, who, by &s;ome Misfortune, had
<PB N="15" REF="002287_0014_0FDB1A8B49189D00">
fallen behind-hand in their Stocks, by which Means they were happily furni&s;hed with Mo|ney to carry forward their &s;inking Trades, or buy Food to feed their &s;tarving Families, till &s;uch time as by Indu&s;try they could mend their &s;unk Fortunes; which bad Fate often happens, both to the Good and Wi&s;e, by Ways unfore&s;een by any Mortal, as Fire, Sickne&s;s, becoming Surely, Per&s;ecution, Rob|bery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another Fund in U&s;e to give Credit to a certain Quantity of Paper-Money, is a Tax hid by Publick Authority; which, after a limited Quantity of Paper Money has been di&s;per&s;ed through a Country, for paying &s;ome publick Debts, whether Arrears, or Yearly-Salaries of publick Officers, or Buildings for the publick U&s;e of the Country. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;aid Tax laid upon &s;uch unperi&s;hable Produce or Manufacture of the Country, as will &s;ink yearly a certain Quantity of the &s;aid Bills, &s;ometimes <HI>One Twealfth, One Eighth,</HI> or <HI>One Fourth,</HI> as the Legi&s;lators think mo&s;t ea&s;y and advantageous to the Publick.</P>
<P>But to make this more plain, we &s;hall &s;up|po&s;e, That in this Province there is a very great Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ome publick Buildings, and to pay publick Debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is in|deed beyond Suppo&s;ition; and what is al&s;o as true, That we have not Money to go to the Market with, much le&s;s to pay large Taxes; and that <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Four Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> mu&s;t be rai&s;ed very quickly, to pay the&s;e our pub|lick Demands: And &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e our

Legi&s;lators world appoint Bills to be made to the Value of the above Sum, and the &s;aid Bills to be paid to an&s;wer the &s;aid Demands, then &s;uch a Tax mu&s;t be laid upon &s;ome of our Produce, or Manufactury, as will rai&s;e <HI>per Annum</HI> the <HI>One Eighth,</HI> &amp;c. of the &s;aid 4000 <HI>l.</HI> which Tax being yearly paid in Bills into the Trea&s;ury of this Province, and tho&s;e Bills de&s;troyed as &s;oon as they are re|ceived, will evidently in <HI>Eight</HI> Years &s;ink the whole Sum of <HI>Four Thou&s;and Pounds.</HI> Which Way of rai&s;ing of large Sums at once, and paying by Degrees, is certainly the ea&s;ie&s;t and be&s;t Way for the Rai&s;ing of publick Buildings, or paying publick Debts, that ever was un|dertook by any Country: Be&s;ides that, to omit the great Advantage a Country drained of its Ca&s;h mu&s;t enjoy, by the Running Stock of Money that mu&s;t naturally circulate from &s;uch an Undertaking.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Thing nece&s;&s;ary, in order to pre&s;erve the Value of Paper-Money (after once it is di&s;tributed through a Country, That it fall not lower than the &s;tated Value of Silver, brings to our Con&s;ideration the mo&s;t material Art of Managing of Paper-Money: From the ill managing of this Part have all the Misfortunes happened that ever befel Paper-Money: To avoid which three Things are nece&s;&s;ary to be regarded.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it exceed not in Quantity the Run|ning Stock of Money a Country demands in its Trade.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002287_0016_0FDB1A912D46BA90">For Paper Money being no exportable Commodity, what&s;oever Quantity there is above what the Trade demands, will lie dead, and con&s;equently &s;ink the Value of the whole Sum of Bills in Proportion to the dead Quantity.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Paper-Money mu&s;t be made a lawful Ten|der in all Payments.</HI></P>
<P>For what Money &s;oever is not &s;uch, can|not be called the Current Money of any Country but a lame Stock; like a founder'd Hor&s;e, will di&s;appoint the Owner at &s;ome time or other, and teach him, that to run well, it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be &s;ound in every Part. If any Kind of Money will not buy me Bread as well as Drink, my Wants are &s;carce Half &s;upplied, and I may &s;tarve for want of this one Thing nece&s;&s;ary, as well as if I had neither.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That Intere&s;t of Paper-Money mu&s;t not be inferior to Silver, or any other Currency of a Country.</HI></P>
<P>For what is it makes Money valued in a Country, but the general U&s;e of it in pay|ing all Debts, and procuring us all our bodily Wants; and withal, be every way as valu|able to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as the Money of a Country can be made to be?? And how can any Money do otherwi&s;e than deceive the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, if he cannot lend it upon the &s;ame Intere&s;t, as any other at the &s;ame Time in U&s;e? Which thing, if not regarded, will &s;ink the Value of Paper-Money, as well as any other thing whatever.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t we have been thus expatiating on the low State of this Province, propo&s;ing a rea|&s;onable Way for her Recovery, and had brought the&s;e Remarks to a Conclu&s;ion, there are two Things of ill Con&s;equence, that hap|pen to us from Abroad, which ju&s;t now oc|cur to our View, the Remedying of which cannot but be of Advantage.</P>

<P>The &s;econd Thing, is, <HI>Our Over-looking the Ve&s;&s;els of a Neighbouring Colony, who very much hinder the Freight of our own; and at the &s;ame time do le&s;&s;en the Ballance of our Trade in the</HI> We&s;t-Indies: They bring us nothing of a Produce or Manufacture of their own worth mentioning, and at their Return rob our Ve&s;&s;els of their Freight to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI>; and what is wor&s;e frequently import us <HI>Salt:</HI>
