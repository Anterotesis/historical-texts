<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PREVIOUS to entering upon the &s;ubject of the following pages, I would merely premi&s;e, that I was but a &s;hort time in the practice of phy&s;ic, until I ob&s;erved the influence of the New and Full Moon, in occa&s;ioning the fir&s;t attacks, and pro|ducing relap&s;es, in the di&s;ea&s;es of the city of Philadelphia. Upon fir&s;t putting my ob&s;ervations on paper, I intended to have pub|li&s;hed them, without taking notice of any of the authors upon the &s;ubjects; but, after &s;hewing my notes to one of my medical friends, a profe&s;&s;or, and taking his advice, I &s;u&s;pended the de&s;ign of printing, until I examined tho&s;e writers who had ta|ken notice of the Influence of the Moon on the di&s;ea&s;es of the human body in other climates.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations are now pre&s;ented to the Public, &s;upported by quotations from the learned: Some of the facts which I looked upon as my own, were, I find, known before; this, although a di&s;appointment, has &s;trengthened tho&s;e which I now give to the world; and which, I hope, will meet with a candid examination before they are rejected; for new truths are always at fir&s;t badly received, becau&s;e, the celebrated Helvetius ob&s;erves, "they &s;hock the vanity of &s;ome men, and contradict opinions generally received."</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN taking notice of the influence of the moon on the di&s;ea&s;es of the human body, I &s;hall make a few ob&s;ervations on her effects in the climate of the United States; &s;how her influence on per&s;ons in perfect health; and, in &s;peaking of di&s;ea&s;es, follow the &s;y&s;tematic order as laid down by Dr. Cullen.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Influence of the Moon. <HI>CLIMATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ABOUT forty-eight hours previous to, and &s;uc|ceeding the new and full moon, all nature appears to be affected; a warm &s;outh-we&s;t wind generally pre|vails; the barometer &s;inks to 29 and 28&frac12; and the thermometer ri&s;es from 15 to 25 degrees:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Ephemerides of the Palatine Meteorological Society of Mannheim for the year 1781, Mr. Hemmer ob&s;erves "of the ba|rometer, the greate&s;t elevation, in the cour&s;e of the year, coincided with the new moon, and the day after its apogee. All the great|e&s;t elevations of each month, except one, and all the lea&s;t, except four, coincided with a lunar point, or the day preceding, or the day following one. From the new moon to the full, the mercury has a tendency to a&s;cend; from the full, to the new moon, it has a tendency to de&s;cend; it is, al&s;o, higher towards the apogee, than towards the perigee of the moon. Of rain and evaporation, it is ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t rainy days coincided with the day prece|ding the eve of a lunar change, &s;eldom with the apogee or perigee of the moon."</P><P>Under the New-York head of October 9th, 1797 we have the following: "La&s;t Tue&s;day was a very warm day for the &s;ea&s;on, the thermometer ri&s;ing to 78&Prime; in the country, and &s;omething high|er in town; during the day, a &s;udden change took place in the weight of the atmo&s;phere; the mercury, in the barometer, fell half an inch in a &s;hort time: the effect on the &s;prings of the mu&s;i|cal clock, in Mr. Baker's Mu&s;eum, was &s;o great as to render its movements uncommonly rapid; and to reduce them to their u&s;ual celerity, it was nece&s;&s;ary to relieve the machinery of fifteen or twenty pounds of its u&s;ual weight. The fact is related by Mr. Baker him&s;elf, and de&s;erves to be recorded, as a curious and not unu&s;eful fact. The hot unela&s;tic or light air, was ob&s;erved about 36 hours before the full of the moon.</P></NOTE> a cold

We may, therefore, expect, that, excepting &s;light or temporary variations, the la&s;t quarter of the moon will afford a &s;pecimen of weather for the three &s;ucceeding weeks.&mdash; The &s;evere cold weather, and we&s;terly winds, this la&s;t autumn, be|gan in the la&s;t week in November, and in the la&s;t quarter of the moon. The &s;evere winter of 1779, 1780, began about the &s;ame time; very &s;oon after the 20th of November, with a fall of &s;now in the la&s;t quarter of the moon.</NOTE>. Within the periods, our tides in the Delaware generally ri&s;e from one to two feet higher than in the intervals.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ram&s;ay of S. C. &s;ays, "tides in A&s;hly and Cooper rivers, in common, ri&s;e and fall five feet; but at the new and full moon &s;even feet."</NOTE> This is &s;o wellknown, that &s;ome of our &s;hip-carpenters wait for the periods before they launch their ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>I believe the water, when the moon comes towards her meridian, is at its greate&s;t heighth; becau&s;e the atmo&s;phere, from the elevation of the column of air directly under her meridian, is dimini&s;hed in weight and pre&s;&s;ure; and not more depre&s;&s;ed, according to Dr. Franklin, who &s;ays, "the tide is a wave, and a wave, a tide in miniature; and that the wave follows her two hours, after &s;he pa&s;&s;es the meridian."</P>
<P>The United States are mo&s;t &s;ubject to inundations at the new and full moon; which is to be accounted for by the high winds, occa&s;ioning the &s;ea to flow in the rivers with a &s;trong current, which check the tides, and cau&s;e them to overflow the low lands.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">On the twenty-eighth of May 1794, we had a new moon, thirty-five minutes pa&s;t &s;even in the afternoon, the tide was higher in our river, by three inches, than it has been known to be by the olde&s;t inhabitants.</NOTE> The lakes on our continent are, likewi&s;e, it is well known, influenced by this luminary.</P>

<HEAD>Of the influence of the moon on people in health.</HEAD>
<P>The influence of this planet, on the animal eco|nomy, has been remarked by many authors, from the venerable Hippocratis to the ingenious Darwin, and particularly by the Arabian phy&s;icians; by Ga|len, Baglivi, Van Helmont, Ballonius, Ramazzini, Pitcairn, Mead, Sir Hans Sloan, Floyer, Grainger, Gregory, Balfour, Mu&s;grave, Lind, Wil&s;on, Mo&s;ely, Leake, Ty&s;on, Wade, Jack&s;on, Laing, and the late Dr. Smith of New-York.</P>
<P>Within the periods, the pul&s;e is generally more quick and ten&s;e than in the intervals; and re&s;piration is more free and ea&s;y: hence, an agreeable &s;en&s;ation of heat is perceived, and vigour is imparted to the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons in health appear to drink more at the full and change; a plethora is induced in the &s;y&s;tem; the appetite of thir&s;t is much increa&s;ed, and, perhaps, one-third le&s;s of the u&s;ual quantity of liquor is re|quired to make a man drunk at this time, than in common. This has been particularly ob&s;erved by the friends and acquaintances of Mr. J&mdash; R&mdash;n of this city.</P>
<P>The appetite for animal food is not increa&s;ed; the determination to the alimentary canal is dimini&s;hed, while that of the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration of the body is much increa&s;ed; the quantity of fluids in the va&s;|cular &s;y&s;tem is more con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ions, made on the &s;en&s;es, excite quicker &s;en&s;ations and reflections. The &s;ecretions are en|crea&s;ed; and hence, I have often ob&s;erved mothers and nur&s;es, in general, who are &s;ucking children, afford more milk at this time.</P>
<P>The young and old, from their accumulated ex|citability, are more &s;en&s;ibly affected than the

middle-aged. A Mr. Ro&s;s, rope-maker, of this city, has a daughter &s;even years old, who enjoys a good &s;hare of health, except at the periods, when &s;he falls in a &s;yncope, which la&s;ts ten or fifteen minutes: when &s;he recovers from this &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, &s;he enjoys her u&s;ual good health until the periods return, when, uncon&s;cious, &s;he is &s;eized as before.</P>
<P>In Hartford, &s;tate of Connecticut, Dr. T. was found dead in the &s;treet: he was going from his neighbour's to his own hou&s;e, January 31, 1794, and on the &s;ame day, hour, and minute the &s;un was in an eclip&s;e with a new moon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mallet, in his life of lord Bacon, page 147, &s;ays, "one &s;ingu|larity there was in his temperament not ea&s;ily to be accounted for. In every eclip&s;e of the moon, whether he ob&s;erved it or not, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a &s;udden fit of fainting; which left him without any remaining weakne&s;s, as &s;oon as the eclip&s;e en|ded."</P><P>Sully, in his Memoirs, Vol. 4. p, 285, &s;peaking of the total eclip&s;e of the &s;un, which happened in the year 1605. &s;ays, "this remarkable old man, Theodore Beza, was &s;eized with an illne&s;s in the eighty-&s;eventh year of his age, which, before the eclip&s;e of the &s;un, was very flight, but grew fatal from that moment; and a few days after, put a period to his exi&s;tence."</P><P>In a note to the above &s;entence, there are the&s;e ob&s;ervations: "many &s;trange maladies, of different kinds, raged at Paris at that time; and together with the eclip&s;e, eclip&s;ed many per&s;ons who have never been &s;een &s;ince. Dy&s;enteries, e&s;pecially, were very mortal and dangerous, and more in other places than at Paris, few who were atacked e&s;caping them"</P></NOTE></P>
<P>On the mind it produces the mo&s;t powerful ef|fects;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">We are informed by Dr. Gregory, that the full moon had a mo&s;t wonderful effect on the mind of the celebrated Chatterton, his poetic vein &s;towing impetuou&s;ly upon him at this time.</NOTE> as an equanimity of temper, a di&s;po&s;ition to cherefulne&s;s, and an aver&s;ion to anger in people of ira&s;cible di&s;po&s;itions; perhaps there may be di&s;co|vered in the atmo&s;phere, a mixture of airs at the pe|riods favourable to the intellectual faculties: in this &s;tate of the mind, phy&s;icians vi&s;it their patients and relations; their friends labouring under contagious di&s;ea&s;es, and are not &s;o liable to receive infection.</P>

<HEAD>Effects of the moon's influence on di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>The revolutions of the moon appear to affect fe|vers in a very con&s;iderable manner, which is of great con&s;equence in their prevention and cure.</P>
<P>The influence of this luminary in this cla&s;s of di&s;|ea&s;es, is more powerful on one of the two days, which immediately precede and follow the full and change, than tho&s;e on the intervening days, or intervals; &s;o, when I &s;hall &s;peak of the&s;e periods, I &s;hall conclude four complete days at each.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve the mo&s;t influence, the nearer we are to tho&s;e periods; with re&s;pect to the two, the full &s;eems to have mo&s;t power, which is agreeable to her &s;itua|tion and proximity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attacks of fevers, (particularly the bili|ous, remitting, and intermitting,) are mo&s;t frequent, their &s;ymptoms more violent, and more difficult to cure at the periods.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Benjamin Mo&s;ely, &s;peaking of the climate of the We&s;t In|dies, p. 112, &s;ays, "and though the moon has unque&s;tionably great influence on cri&s;is, and relap&s;es in continued and intermittent fe|vers, yet lunacy is almo&s;t unknown."</P><P>And in a note, at the bottom of the &s;ame page, he &s;ays, "In the &s;pring of the year 1777, I remarked that mo&s;t of the patients whom I attended in fevers, were much affected in the head at every new and full moon; I have ob&s;erved the &s;ame thing often, but never &s;o uniformly as in that year."</P><P>Dr. Robert Jack&s;on, in his treati&s;e on the fevers of Jamaica, p. 58, &s;ays, "the approach to new and full moon, appears to be connected with the inva&s;ion and relap&s;e of fevers, in a very remark|able manner."</P><P>In page 63 and 64, he &s;ays, continuing his ob&s;ervations in America; "at the beginning of Augu&s;t, 1778, the encampment was at King&s;bridge, where it occupied a very unhealthy &s;itua|tion; when the regiment moved from their ground in the be|ginning of November, of one hundred ca&s;es of intermitting fe|ver, which were marked in the almanac, eighty were found to have commenced in the u&s;ual period of inva&s;ion; that is, in the &s;econd and la&s;t quarter of the moon. This regiment embarked for Georgia in November, and remained there until the capitula|tion at York-town. The &s;entence is concluded by this ob&s;erva|tion, "of this, however, I am certain, that even at times of the greate&s;t epidemic &s;ickne&s;s, when the connection was evidently weake&s;t, the number of the &s;ick was generally doubled in the pe|riods approaching to new and full moon."</P></NOTE> Vomits are principally of &s;er|vice

at this time, in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, as there is mo&s;tly a di&s;po&s;ition to puke, from an immen&s;e quantity of acrid bile in the primae viae.</P>
<P>The effects of the moon's influence upon the human body, may, in &s;ome degree, be accounted for, by a change in the qualities of the air, and not by any &s;upernatural or incomprehen&s;ible manner.</P>
<P>The proportion of oxygene empyreal or vital air is encrea&s;ed, and hydrogene or inflammable air dimi|ni&s;hed&mdash;fir&s;t, by the winds that prevail at the periods, which unite, ab&s;orb and carry off, an over-abun|dance of noxious vapours, generated by the calm|ne&s;s, warmth, and clo&s;ene&s;s of the atmo&s;phere in the intervals, &s;o pernicious to animal and vegetable life: &s;econdly, the rains: thirdly, thunder and lightning: fourthly, by ri&s;ing of the lakes and rivers, which ex|po&s;e a larger &s;urface to ab&s;orb and attract impure air: fifthly, by the increa&s;ed per&s;piration of vegetables, ab|&s;orbing impure, and giving out pure air: &s;ixthly, the influence of the light of the moon at night, (con|trary to Dr. Prie&s;tley, who &s;ays, "vegetables don't give out pure air from the dark:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wil&s;on, from experiments, &s;ays, "the moon-&s;hine ri|pens fruits, and encrea&s;es the growth of plants."</NOTE>) and &s;eventhly, by the exhilarity ob&s;erved in people in health; as it is generally allowed, the more pure air, the more the &s;pirits are rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Of the bilious remitting, or yellow fever, of the year 1793, the fir&s;t attacks, relap&s;es, and deaths, were more frequent at the periods, than during the intervals. This was ob&s;erved of the plague of Nime|guen, by Dicerrerbraeck in the year 1636.</P>

Duffield, of Philadelphia, &s;ays, "the &s;everity of the fir&s;t attacks, often appeared to determine the event of this complaint; and this &s;everity has &s;eemed, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to depend on &s;ome unknown influence, in a curious man|ner. I have been a&s;toni&s;hed to find that a large proportion of the deaths of five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, were patients all taken &s;ick within twelve hours of each other, and that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who recover|ed, were &s;everely handled. This remark will be found particu|larly true in re&s;pect to tho&s;e who were taken &s;ick on the 12th and 13th in&s;tant (Sept. 1795.) After a&s;certaining the fact, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the new-moon took place in the morning of the 13th, that the thermometer had &s;tood much higher late in the morning of the &s;ame day, than at noon, and that for three days, the barometer had not varied in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible de|gree."</NOTE> Per|haps the encrea&s;ed circulation of the fluids, in the &s;y&s;tem at the change and full moon, renders the body more alkale&s;cent: may not this be the rea&s;on why phlogo&s;is, &s;ometimes in a few hours, puts on &s;ymp|toms of gangrene and &s;phacelus. This was particu|larly noticed in the ca&s;e of a butcher in Spring Gar|den, in the month of January, 1793, who had an inflammation between his thunb and fore finger, about the time the moon was full, when, in a few hours, a gangrene appeared, which put an end to his exi&s;tence.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Hans Sloan, in the introduction to his hi&s;tory of Jamaica, P. 106, mentions a &s;trange di&s;ea&s;e in a black woman, who&s;e fin|gers and toes were filled with bladders of water, which mortified. He al&s;o &s;ays, p. 107, "I have &s;een more di&s;ea&s;es than this come on exactly at the&s;e times, (periods of the moon) but they have generally been epilep&s;ies, or other di&s;ea&s;es of the head, and have not been &s;o vi&s;ible as the&s;e ve&s;icles of water above men|tioned."</NOTE></P>

<P>I &s;hall digre&s;s a moment, in order to corroborate this ob&s;ervation further, by a few facts taken from the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

Second, young bees, if they lodge in the decrea&s;e of the moon, appear to produce little or no honey, and a number die; but if in the encrea&s;e, they commonly produce as much, if not more, than the old. Third, oy&s;ters, crabs, lob&s;ters and mu&s;cles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This ob&s;ervation is confirmed in Hughes's Natural Hi&s;tory of Barbadoes.</NOTE> are more fat and plump at the full than new moon.

<P>Perhaps the rea&s;on why apoplexy &s;o frequently at|tends the periodical revolutions of this influential planet, is the calm that attends her, occa&s;ioning a &s;tagnation of the air and noxious exhalations from our earth; the winds that &s;ucceed purify this air: the &s;udden change of the &s;en&s;ible and in&s;en&s;ible quali|ties of this fluid, by producing indirect debility, which this di&s;ea&s;e is chiefly founded in, and which encrea&s;es the afflux of fluids in the arteries of the head, and produces di&s;tention, or more frequently effu&s;ion, de&s;|troys the mobility, or energy of the nervous power in the brain. Hence a &s;tagnation, and its con&s;equen|ces, rupture, effu&s;ion, and death. Of the many and numerous ca&s;es which came under my notice, in this city, I &s;hall mention in the&s;e ob&s;ervations but three. Friday, May 16, 1793, I vi&s;ited a young man, twenty-five years of age, who was &s;eized with an apoplexy, which proved fatal in five minutes. On the twenty-&s;econd of June, I &s;aw another ca&s;e, which al&s;o termi|nated in death; and on the thirty-fir&s;t of Dec. a wo|man, aged fifty-three, was in&s;tantly carried off in the &s;ame manner: the&s;e ca&s;es were within the periods of the moon.

<P>Periodical pal&s;ies often appear within the periods, (Pi&s;o and Tulpius, &s;peaks of her bringing on periodi|cal pal&s;ies,) which are cau&s;ed by an overflow of pu|trid bile in the &s;tomach at this time, and which a puke &s;ometimes has cured.</P>
<P>Women, and people of delicate con&s;titutions, are &s;ometimes &s;ubject to &s;yncope at the periodical revo|lutions of the moon, when the face has not that death-like appearance, but is florid, the eyes are troubled, and the mouth is &s;hut; the cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e are to be particularly avoided at this time; blood-letting is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at the periods, a recumbent po&s;ture and cold water thrown on the head and face &s;ucceeds here, Syncope often attends at the periods; in the recent &s;tate of acute di&s;ea&s;es, it is by no means a favourable &s;ymptom. By attend|ing to lunar influence, I am enabled to progno&s;ti|cate with more certainty the return, i&s;&s;ue, and cure of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Dy&s;pep&s;ia is both ideopathic and &s;ymptomatic, whenever it attacks weak and delicate habits, at the periods. It is produced by various cau&s;es, as the en|crea&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile, in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, which act immediately on the &s;tomach, or on it through the medium of the whole &s;y&s;tem: the &s;ick head-ach

in nine out of ten ca&s;es, accompanies this di&s;ea&s;e at the periods; and in &s;ome ca&s;es the circulation is &s;o languid that the blood &s;tagnates and the face becomes livid, &s;welled and has an unu&s;ual appearance. As there is always an unea&s;ine&s;s in this organ, an emetic is the cure, with an attention to the relation of aliments.</P>
<P>Convul&s;ions often attack and return at the new and full moon, in middle-aged robu&s;t men, rather than women or old people: it is no uncommon di&s;ea&s;e for children to have at the periods<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Pitcairne al&s;o &s;peaks of a "violent convul&s;ion of the arm returning periodically twice a year, viz. in March and Sep|tember, at full moon near the vernal and autumnal equinoxes."</NOTE>. Acrid matters, as bile in the alimentary canal, is the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of it in them. There is often a con&s;iderable action of the nervous &s;y&s;tem at the periods, which is to be ta|ken down by bleeding, vomits and cold air. In May 1793, I was called to &s;ee a child five years old, lay|ing in convul&s;ions, for the fir&s;t time, within the pe|riods. This child was bled three times before &s;he re|covered. Fits at the beginning and clo&s;e of fevers, and pregnant women, at the periods, are unfavour|able &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Strong people, men and children delicately educat|ed, are often &s;ubject to fir&s;t attacks and relap&s;es of epilep&s;y within the periods, the paroxy&s;ms are at|tended with highly inflammatory &s;ymptoms, which generally continue thro' life. The moon, &s;ays Galen, governs the periods of epileptic ca&s;es, which is al&s;o confirmed by Drs. Pitcairne, Ty&s;on, of Bethlehem ho&s;pital, and the celebrated Mead.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Leake on the di&s;ea&s;es of the vi&s;cera, page 400, &s;ays "many in&s;tances might here be brought to &s;how the remarkable effects of lunar influence in di&s;ea&s;es of the brain and nerves.

which is favourable to epilep&s;y; and the retention of acrid matter in the alimentary canal, occa&s;ioned by the encrea&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile, together with a co&s;tive habit. Among many, &s;hall notice but three ca&s;es. S&mdash; H&mdash;, &s;tone cutter, November 18th, 1793, the moon being full, was &s;eized with two paroxy&s;ms by ten o'clock in the morning.

Mi&s;s S&mdash; A&mdash;, aged nineteen, in the year 1785, was engaged to be married to a gentleman from Maryland, who di&s;ap|pointing her by marrying another lady, it occa&s;ioned an indi&s;po&s;ition in the former lady, in which epileptic fits appeared, and continued after her recovery, re|turned periodically within the periods of the moon until her death, in the beginning of 1795. Mrs. W&mdash;, who&s;e fits were brought on by the lo&s;s of an only brother, were continued near twelve years, and were governed by lunar influence. The&s;e ob&s;ervations were made from a long per&s;onal acquaintance with the above ladies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Darwin &s;ays, "the periods of hemicrania and of pain|ful epilep&s;y, are liable to obey lunar periods both in their diur|nal returns, and in their greater periods of weeks, but are al&s;o in|duced by other exciting cau&s;es."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;pa&s;modic &s;pecies of the a&s;thma, attended with an excels of action in the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, fre|quently occurs at the periods; which Van Helmont and Sir John Floyer, have ob&s;erved:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Leake, on di&s;ea&s;es of women, vol. i. page 384, &s;ays, the changes of air at the new and full moon, e&s;pecially a little before the vernal and autumnal equinoxes have con&s;iderable in|fluence on the health of all animals. At this time, &s;torms and tempe&s;ts generally prevail; the air is rendered too light, and being in&s;ufficient to blow up the lungs, the blood cannot pa&s;s too freely through them. Hence difficulty of breathing and pal|pitation of the heart, attended with &s;leepine&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> Bleeding is proper here; al&s;o fixed air breathed into the lungs, is &s;ome|times a remedy in this &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e within the periods.</P>

at the periods; now colic is generally produ|ced by co&s;tivene&s;s, and bile is &s;uppo&s;ed, by Dr. Quere, of Jamaica, to be a frequent cau&s;e of this complaint. Hence per&s;ons are mo&s;t liable to fir&s;t attacks and re|lap&s;es of colic, accompanied with exce&s;s of action in the mu&s;cular fibres of the alimentary canal. On Wedne&s;day, May 14th, 1794, being within the peri|ods of the moon, I &s;aw near &s;ix ca&s;es of the bilious colic; ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time a co&s;tive habit, and the encrea&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile, to be the effects of the moon's influence.

<P>Tho' children, from a peculiar weakne&s;s of con&s;ti|tution, are more &s;ubject to the cholera morbus than adults, yet it frequently affects the latter, attended with more inflammatory and bilious &s;ymptoms than in the intervals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Peter Wade &s;ays, page 58, &s;peaking of an officer, attacked with the gungle fever in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">hur di&s;trict&punc; "He is &s;till, however, &s;ubject to con&s;iderable irregularity in the &s;ecre|tions of the bowels, e&s;pecially at the periods of the moon."</NOTE> We &s;hould avoid &s;leeping with the windows open at the periods, as the weather is changeable, and our per&s;piration, being encrea&s;ed, is more liable to be ob&s;tructed, and produce this affec|tion.</P>
