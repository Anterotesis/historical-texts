<HEAD>The Pre&s;ent Melancholy Circum|&s;tances of the PROVINCE Con&s;ider'd, and Methods for Redre&s;s humbly propo&s;ed, in a Letter from one in the Country to one in Bo&s;ton.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE our la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e about the unea&s;ie threatning Circum&s;tances of this <HI>Pro|vince,</HI> as to <HI>Money</HI> or a <HI>Medium</HI> of <HI>Trade.</HI> I have employed my thoughts &s;omewhat in the matter, and I'll briefly hint &s;ome things that have occur'd to my mind.</P>
<P>OUR Fathers that fir&s;t &s;ettled the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> brought &s;ome <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> with them, after a while, &s;ome <HI>Money</HI> was Coined here, as <HI>Shillings, Six-Pences,</HI> &amp;c. But in proce&s;s of time, (even long before <HI>Silver</HI> Money was generally <HI>Exported,</HI> or carried out of the Province,) the greate&s;t part of the <HI>pa&s;&s;ing Money</HI> here, was <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> viz. <HI>Pieces of Eight, Half Pieces, Eight Pences,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>This Money</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e was chiefly the <HI>Returns</HI> made for our <HI>Fi&s;h, Lumber, Hor&s;es, Grain, Beaf, Pork,</HI> &amp;c. Exported or carried out of the Country. I think this demon&s;trates, that in tho&s;e times what we <HI>Exported</HI> of our <HI>own produce</HI> (or the fruits of
<PB N="2" REF="002067_0002_0FBB78FE535274F8">
our own labour,) was more than what was <HI>Im|ported</HI> from other Places, either for <HI>Food, Drink,</HI> or <HI>Cloathing;</HI> therefore to make the <HI>Ballance, Money</HI> came in, and continued Circulating a|mong us. In tho&s;e times the Wealth of this Country was on the <HI>growing band.</HI> But of late Years, I'll &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Twenty</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, our <HI>Silver Money</HI> has been generally <HI>Exported,</HI> &s;o that now there is not a <HI>Penny</HI> of it pa&s;&s;ing be|tween Man and Man. Tho' I don't know ex|actly (nor I believe any one el&s;e) how much <HI>Money</HI> has been <HI>Exported</HI> this la&s;t <HI>Twenty Years,</HI> yet I'll now &s;uppo&s;e it to be <HI>Three Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds;</HI> and I'll &s;uppo&s;e we have now about <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> out in <HI>Province Bills;</HI> what's out in <HI>Province Bills,</HI> and to be Collected by <HI>Tax,</HI> the Province <HI>owes</HI> for, and is &s;o much <HI>in Debt;</HI> what's out upon <HI>Loan,</HI> is owing for by <HI>particular Per&s;ons</HI> in the Province, &s;o that the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of this Province owe for the whole. Now if the gue&s;s I have made be exact, (which I don't pretend to) or pretty near it, then this <HI>Province</HI> in what is <HI>&s;pent</HI> and what is <HI>owed</HI> for, are about <HI>Five Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> &s;unk in their E&s;tates, in about <HI>Twenty Years.</HI> If my gue&s;s be right in the <HI>Silver Exported,</HI> and the <HI>Province Bills</HI> now out, then the Conclu&s;ion I've drawn mu&s;t needs be true.</P>
<P>BUT how comes it that we have &s;unk &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="002067_0003_0FBB78FF87043808">
much in our E&s;tates, in &s;o &s;hort a time? If any think it occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Wars</HI> we have had in the la&s;t <HI>Twenty Years;</HI> I'm humbly of a different Sentiment; for we did <HI>not hire Fo|reigners</HI> to manage our <HI>Wars.</HI> This Province did not &s;end away <HI>Silver Money,</HI> to hire a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance again&s;t <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>French.</HI> My opinion therefore is, that our <HI>decay in Wealth</HI> is chiefly owing to our <HI>Mi&s;managements,</HI> e&s;pecially our <HI>Extravagance.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is <HI>Imported</HI> into the Province, &amp; <HI>Spent</HI> here, is, or &s;hould be <HI>Paid for;</HI> el&s;e we are <HI>di&s;hone&s;t,</HI> which does not become <HI>Men,</HI> much le&s;s <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as we are: And if the Fruits and <HI>Produce of our own Labour in this Province,</HI> won't make a &s;ufficient <HI>Export</HI> to pay for what we receive <HI>from Abroad,</HI> and <HI>Spend</HI> here; then the <HI>Silver</HI> goes to make the <HI>Ballance,</HI> and pay the remainder.</P>
<P>AND this is the very Ca&s;e, the &s;hort and long of the Bu&s;ine&s;s. Our <HI>Silver</HI> is gone to pay the <HI>overplus</HI> of <HI>Imported Goods,</HI> above what our own <HI>Product Exported,</HI> could pay. Among the Commodities <HI>Imported,</HI> &s;ome are really <HI>u&s;eful</HI> for us, which we are not able to <HI>rai&s;e,</HI> or <HI>make</HI> our &s;elves, &s;ome not at all, &s;ome not as yet, or not enough of it, as <HI>Canvas, Riggin, Bra&s;s, Copper, Pewter, Tin-Ware, Gla&s;s</HI> for Windows, <HI>Sugar, Melo&s;&s;es, Cotton-Wool, Paper, Needles, Pins, Scythes, Sickles, Cutlary Ware,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="002067_0004_0FBB7900F91F8130">
our <HI>own Produce</HI> (if we joyned <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> together) which might be <HI>Ex|ported,</HI> would be enough to pay for all the <HI>Im|ported</HI> Commodities, which are really <HI>needful</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> for us.</P>
<P>BUT then many things have been <HI>Imported,</HI> which have <HI>not been nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> yet very co&s;tly; &s;uch as <HI>Silver and Gold Lace,</HI> worn on <HI>Cloaths</HI> and <HI>Shoes, Velvet, Rich Silk, Sattin, Silk Stockings, Fine Broad-Cloths, Camlets, Perriwiggs, Fine co&s;tly Shoes and Pattoons, Ribbons, Rich Lace, Silk-Han|kerchiefs, Fine Hatts, Gloves</HI> of great price and little worth, <HI>China Ware,</HI> very <HI>Co&s;tly-Looking|Gla&s;&s;es, Cane-Chairs, Co&s;tly Beds &amp; Furniture,</HI> &amp;c. We in the Country, think that <HI>&s;ome &s;cores of Thou&s;ands of Pounds</HI> in late Years, have been &s;pent by this Province in the&s;e things, and that the Province would have been much better without them. I don't now contend again&s;t the&s;e things as being <HI>Unlawful in them&s;elves;</HI> but for us to &s;end off our <HI>Silver Money</HI> to buy them, &amp; now not have a Penny to pa&s;s between Man &amp; Man for our nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, I think has not been our <HI>Prudence</HI> but our great <HI>Folly.</HI></P>
<P>POSSIBLY &s;ome will &s;ay, the fault is in the <HI>Middling</HI> or <HI>Poorer</HI> &s;ort of People, who buy the&s;e things, and go <HI>above their Ability,</HI> in doing it. The reply is, Po&s;&s;ibly it has been great <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Richer</HI> &s;ort to lead in the&s;e things, and <HI>greater folly</HI> in the <HI>Poorer</HI> to follow them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002067_0005_0FBB79098DED3750">
HOWEVER, its matter of Fact, that there's much <HI>needle&s;s Expence</HI> in &s;undry of the&s;e things, and tho' &s;ome <HI>Richer</HI> Per&s;ons or Families can bear the <HI>Co&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Expences, yet <HI>Poorer</HI> ones (who too much affect them) can't; but whether &s;uch things are &s;pent by <HI>Rich</HI> or <HI>Poor,</HI> its all one to the Province in general. For what's <HI>Imported</HI> and &s;pent in the Province mu&s;t be paid for by <HI>Export</HI> from it; and if the <HI>Pro|duce of our Labour</HI> won't do it, our <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold</HI> mu&s;t go (or rather is gone) to make it up.</P>
<P>AND as I'm humbly of Opinion, that this Pro|vince had much better have been without, many <HI>Scores of Thou&s;ands of Pounds</HI> of fine co&s;tly things <HI>Imported</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;pent</HI> here; &s;o I believe other things tho' <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in their <HI>time &amp; mea&s;ure,</HI> have been <HI>Im|ported</HI> and Spent in <HI>greater Quantities,</HI> than has been for our good, Such as <HI>Wine, Rum, Brandy,</HI> (not to mention <HI>Tea, Coffee, Chacolet,</HI> which People here formerly did very well without) that there has been much <HI>needle&s;s Expence</HI> in the&s;e things, I &s;uppo&s;e none will deny. So far and &s;o fre|quently as any have drunk to <HI>exce&s;s,</HI> the Sin of <HI>Drunk&egrave;nne&s;s</HI> has been chargeable on them, which they &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly and penitently con&s;ider of; but I'm now con&s;idering the mat|ter, as to <HI>Co&s;t</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Imported Liquors.</HI> If <HI>&s;everal Thou&s;and Pounds Yearly,</HI> are <HI>needle&s;ly</HI> &s;pent in the&s;e things, &s;o many <HI>Thou&s;ands a Year</HI> we are hurt even on this account, that our <HI>Export</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002067_0006_0FBB790AE79627C0">
does not (without &s;ending off <HI>Silver</HI>) equal our <HI>Import.</HI> If out of our <HI>own Produce,</HI> a Cargo of <HI>Staves, Hoops, Hor&s;es, &amp;c.</HI> has for its <HI>return,</HI> a Cargo of <HI>Wine</HI> or <HI>Rum,</HI> and <HI>one Third</HI> of it is <HI>needle&s;ly</HI> expended and wa&s;ted here; if in&s;tead of this <HI>Third</HI> needle&s;ly &s;pent, the return had been made in <HI>Silver,</HI> I think this might be call'd <HI>double gain.</HI> And &s;ince as to the <HI>Co&s;t part</HI> (be&s;ides the <HI>Sin</HI> of Intemperance) we are much hurt by the <HI>needle&s;s Expence</HI> of <HI>Imported Liquors;</HI> I conceive that the <HI>needle&s;s</HI> multiply|ing <HI>Taverns</HI> and <HI>Retailers,</HI> tends further to im|poveri&s;h us. For Per&s;ons thus <HI>employ'd</HI> think to get a <HI>Living</HI> by their <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and &s;o are for <HI>drawing</HI> and <HI>vending</HI> as much <HI>Liquor</HI> as they can, and its to be fear'd, criminally incourage others to buy, and the more is &s;pent for what's <HI>Imported,</HI> the more mu&s;t be <HI>Exported</HI> in one thing or other to <HI>Pay</HI> for it. And tho' &s;ome may think it a <HI>Publick advantage</HI> to <HI>multiply Licences</HI> for <HI>&s;elling of Drink,</HI> to draw more <HI>Exci&s;e Mo|ney</HI> into the <HI>Trea&s;ury;</HI> yet I conceive it to be a <HI>Publick hurt,</HI> becau&s;e our <HI>Import</HI> mu&s;t be an&s;|wered by our <HI>Export;</HI> and yet we have not e|nough of the latter to do it; therefore our <HI>Silver Money</HI> is gone.  A <HI>needle&s;s</HI> mul|tiplying of <HI>Retailers,</HI> whether of <HI>Drink</HI> or <HI>Shop Goods,</HI> is no advantage to the Publick. For if the &s;ame Goods are bought by <HI>Ten Per&s;ons</HI> one after another, with de&s;ign to Sell again,
<PB N="7" REF="002067_0007_0FBB790C4CB54FA8">
before the Per&s;on buys them that de&s;igns to <HI>wear</HI> or <HI>u&s;e</HI> them; each of tho&s;e <HI>Ten Per&s;ons</HI> aims at <HI>Gain</HI> in pa&s;&s;ing thro' his hands, and the <HI>la&s;t</HI> buyer and <HI>u&s;er</HI> pays it all; whereas if he had bought it of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>&s;econd Seller,</HI> he might have &s;av'd the <HI>gain</HI> which the other <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine</HI> Per&s;ons had, and tho&s;e Per&s;ons might have been im|ploy'd in other Bu&s;ine&s;s. For tho' in this ca&s;e &s;up|po&s;ed, the <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine needle&s;s Retailers,</HI> get &s;ome gain to them&s;elves, and the la&s;t <HI>buyer</HI> and <HI>u&s;er</HI> pays it all, yet the <HI>Province,</HI> or <HI>Publick</HI> is not enrich'd <HI>one Farthing</HI> by their labour. If they had been employ'd in <HI>Husbandry,</HI> or <HI>Handycraft-Bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> there would probably have been &s;ome produce of their labour for the Publick Good; either <HI>Grain, Cattle, Hemp, Flax rai&s;ed,</HI> or <HI>Cloath, Shoes,</HI> or <HI>Uten&s;ils</HI> made, which might be &s;er|viceable to them&s;elves or others; but their <HI>meer banding of Goods one to another,</HI> no more increa&s;es any Wealth in the Province, than Per&s;ons <HI>at a Fire</HI> increa&s;e the <HI>Water in a Pail,</HI> by pa&s;&s;ing it thro' <HI>Twenty</HI> or <HI>Forty hands.</HI> This matter might be con&s;idered, as to <HI>Petty Shops,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Huck|&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Fore&s;tallers of the Market.</HI> I would not be thought here to condemn <HI>Retailing</HI> in general, for doubtle&s;s Per&s;ons may get an <HI>hone&s;t Living</HI> by it, and tho&s;e who <HI>buy</HI> of them may be <HI>gainers</HI> too, by having the Commodities brought <HI>nearer,</HI> which prevents the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Expence</HI> of <HI>travelling</HI> farther for them. It's therefore only
<PB N="8" REF="002067_0008_0FBB790DFA3926C0">
a <HI>needle&s;s Retailing</HI> (whether of <HI>Drink</HI> or other <HI>Commodities</HI>) which I look on as hurtful to the Publick, becau&s;e the Per&s;ons &s;o employed, real|ly <HI>rai&s;e or produce no good to the Public<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> which they might do if labouring in &s;ome other and proper bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>Needle&s;s Retailers,</HI> with re&s;pect to any Publick benefit, are really <HI>Idlers;</HI> they help to &s;pend what is <HI>Rai&s;ed</HI> or <HI>Imported,</HI> but produce neither by their labour.</P>
<P>THUS I've hinted by what way and means I conceive our <HI>Silver</HI> has been <HI>Exported,</HI> and we are &s;unk &s;o <HI>deep in Debt,</HI> viz. by <HI>Importing</HI> and &s;pending many things which we had better been without; and by an <HI>exce&s;&s;ive &s;pending</HI> &s;ome things <HI>Imported,</HI> which in them&s;elves con&s;ider'd, and in their <HI>time</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> may be reckon'd <HI>u&s;eful.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Que&s;tion is, How to <HI>redre&s;s this grievance, &amp; extricate our &s;elves from the&s;e diffi|culties.</HI> I think this Que&s;tion is not improper to be thought upon, by any one that wi&s;hes well to this Province, as I'm &s;ure I heartily do. My Opinion is, that we can't &s;uddenly or at once get rid of the&s;e difficulties, which our own <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Extravagance</HI> have brought us into. Yet I Con|jecture, that in a few Years time, by an ordinary cour&s;e of Providence we might gradually free our &s;elves from them. When a <HI>Traveller</HI> knows he has mi&s;&s;ed his way, he often goes back in the &s;ame Path, 'till he's &s;ure that he is in the right

road again. I think we &s;hould take the &s;ame method. In the mean time, let us Cultivate <HI>Peace, Love, Unity,</HI> not be hard on one another for diffe|rent &s;entiments, about ways to mend our Cir|cum&s;tances; let us not foment <HI>Parties</HI> and <HI>Facti|ons,</HI> but &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid them, as we love GOD and our COUNTRY, <HI>Every City or Hou&s;e divided again&s;t it &s;elf, &s;hall not &s;tand.</HI> Thus watching again&s;t Di&s;cord, I'll &s;ay, Let not Merchants <HI>Import needle&s;s Commodities,</HI> or if they do, let us <HI>not buy or u&s;e</HI> them; nor u&s;e <HI>more than needs</HI> of what is <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>LET no <HI>Wool, Hides, Leather, Grain</HI> nor <HI>Candles</HI> be <HI>Exported,</HI> when at a dear price. Let us grow more <HI>Frugal</HI> in <HI>furni&s;hing &amp; adorning</HI> our Hou&s;es, in our <HI>Cloths, Food</HI> and <HI>Drink,</HI> this we might do (many at lea&s;t) without hurting our Bodies by <HI>Cold, Thir&s;t</HI> or <HI>Hunger.</HI> Let us be diligent and la|borious, to <HI>rai&s;e, produce, make</HI> as much as we can for our own &s;upport, as to <HI>Food, Raiment, Tools, Uten&s;ils.</HI> Let <HI>Husbandry,</HI> (tilling theground) be more diligently and generally followed, that <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> may be rais'd, and <HI>Barley</HI> to make <HI>Drink,</HI> that &s;o the le&s;s <HI>Imported Drink</HI> might be called for.

room of it; I &s;ay, hereby <HI>Merchants Imported Goods</HI> are come to an <HI>Extravagant Advance.</HI> When we buy <HI>European</HI> or <HI>West-India</HI> Goods, we give for &s;ome <HI>double,</HI> for others <HI>more than double</HI> the Price that was given <HI>Fifteen</HI> or <HI>Twen|ty</HI> Years ago. This nece&s;&s;itates us in the <HI>Coun|try,</HI> to <HI>rai&s;e in &s;ome proportion</HI> the Price of our <HI>Grain, Fle&s;h, Wood, Hay, Butter, Chee&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> We formerly Sold <HI>Butter, Six pence a Pound,</HI> that <HI>Six Pence</HI> would buy <HI>Two Pounds of Sugar,</HI> and if we now have <HI>Nine pence</HI> a Pound for <HI>Butter,</HI> that <HI>Nine pence</HI> will buy but <HI>One Pound of Su|gar,</HI> or thereabouts. So that when we receive &s;o great a Price as we do, yet we find it hard enough to rub along; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e <HI>Bo&s;ton di&s;temper</HI> is got into the <HI>Country,</HI> that is, <HI>We</HI> and our <HI>Families</HI> are fond of many <HI>needle&s;s Imported Commodities,</HI> and mu&s;t pay the <HI>Impor|ters</HI> or Merchants an Extravagant rate for them. If this <HI>rai&s;ing on one another</HI> in Trade, <HI>helps</HI> &s;ome, yet it <HI>hurts</HI> more.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing which very much de&s;erves our con&s;ideration is, That <HI>Salary Men, Mini|&s;ters, School-Ma&s;ters, Judges of the Circuit, Pre|&s;ident &amp; Tutors</HI> at <HI>Colledge, Widows</HI> and <HI>Orphans, &amp;c.</HI> are pincht and hurt more than any; for while they pay it may be double or more, both for <HI>Imported Goods,</HI> and the <HI>Produce of the Coun|try,</HI> yet their <HI>Salaries</HI> are not increas'd (if at all) <HI>in proportion,</HI> to what the <HI>Merchant</HI> and
<PB N="13" REF="002067_0013_0FBB791DB82BBAF0">
<HI>Husbandman</HI> rai&s;es upon one another, tho' they mu&s;t buy of <HI>both.</HI> If Ju&s;tice and Equity don't &s;ay, their <HI>Salaries</HI> ought to be increas'd, let any one judge.</P>
<P>BUT po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome will &s;ay, if we do our ut|mo&s;t to <HI>rai&s;e nece&s;&s;aries for our &s;elves,</HI> and buy no more than <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> requires of <HI>Imported Com|modities,</HI> this cour&s;e will &s;poil <HI>Merchandizing</HI> and <HI>Trading.</HI> I reply, the good of the whole &s;hould be preferred to that of a part. <HI>Mer|chandizing</HI> and <HI>Trading</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary and <HI>profita|ble</HI> for us, if well manag'd; but mi&s;manage|ment therein, may hurt a People. <HI>Trading</HI> has carried off our <HI>Money,</HI> we have not a <HI>Shilling</HI> in <HI>Silver</HI> Pa&s;&s;ing, and we are deep in Debt; has <HI>not this Trading</HI> almo&s;t ruin'd us? Is not this, to <HI>buy and &s;ell and live by the lo&s;s?</HI> It is not profi|table to the Publick, to have <HI>too many</HI> of any <HI>particular Trade or Calling,</HI> for they mu&s;t either be <HI>idle</HI> (when they might be imploy'd in proper bu&s;ine&s;s) or labour <HI>for little or nothing,</HI> which is unprofitable to them&s;elves, and to the Pub|lick therein. If there be Merchants enough to manage the <HI>Export</HI> we can <HI>rai&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Import we need,</HI> there's enough; <HI>Supernumera|ries</HI> are <HI>hurtful</HI> not <HI>&s;erviceable</HI> to the Publick; 'twould be better they were imploy'd in other bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY, &s;ome think, that the Emitting <HI>more Paper Money</HI> would bring us out of our
<PB N="14" REF="002067_0014_0FBB791FD379BF90">
difficulties, but I'm humbly of another Opinion. I think &s;ome engaged in Trade have ob&s;erv'd, that &s;ince the Emitting the <HI>la&s;t Hundred Thou|&s;and Pounds,</HI> the <HI>Price</HI> of Commodities <HI>Imported,</HI> and of our own <HI>Produce,</HI> has been con&s;iderably <HI>rais'd;</HI> which is not &s;o much from the <HI>&s;carcity</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Commodities,</HI> as from the <HI>mean opinion</HI> Per&s;ons have of the <HI>pa&s;&s;ing Money.</HI> The la&s;t I have heard is, that when <HI>Silver Money</HI> is Sold (now and then a little as &s;ome can get it) it fetches <HI>Eleven</HI> or <HI>Twelve Shillings</HI> an <HI>Ounce</HI> in <HI>Paper Money;</HI> whereas according to our <HI>Law (Seventeen Penny Weight at Six Shillings) Silver</HI> Money is but a very &s;mall matter more than <HI>Seven Shillings an Ounce.</HI> This plainly &s;hows the <HI>low value</HI> People have for <HI>Paper Money.</HI> It &s;eems as tho' the more 'tis <HI>increas'd</HI> the <HI>le&s;s 'tis valued.</HI> I'm prone to think, that if <HI>every Fa|mily</HI> in the Province, had a <HI>Thou&s;and Pounds in Paper Money; Twenty Shillings</HI> of it, would not then buy &s;o much, as <HI>Five Shillings</HI> will now. In this Province, People generally de&s;ire to be <HI>Freehold,</HI> they don't chu&s;e to be <HI>Tenants,</HI> and <HI>pay Rent.</HI> But if we <HI>take up Money</HI> whether of the <HI>Province</HI> or <HI>particular Per&s;ons,</HI> on our <HI>Lands;</HI> we &s;o far become <HI>Tenants</HI> to the <HI>Lenders,</HI> and <HI>pay Rent</HI> to them. And if we can't pay when what's borrowed is regularly call'd for, but a <HI>Cour&s;e of Law</HI> recovers <HI>Land</HI> from us; po&s;&s;ibly <HI>more Land</HI> will be taken, then we &s;hould have
<PB N="15" REF="002067_0015_0FBB79252D69BF68">
been willing to have Sold, for <HI>half &s;o much more</HI> as we have <HI>borrowed.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome who have <HI>taken up Money on their Lands,</HI> by being uncapable of paying will <HI>lo&s;e them; Frugality</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> would have been a greater kind|ne&s;s to &s;uch, than their <HI>hiring Money</HI> was.</P>
<P>THIS (out of true love to my dear Country, where I was born, and hitherto have liv'd, without ill will to any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons what&s;oever,) I've freely given you &s;ome hints of my Opinion, about our pre&s;ent uncomforta|ble Circum&s;tances; you may con&s;ider 'em, and communicate 'em to your Neighbours if they I do any good. If you &s;ee meet to return your own thoughts to me in Writing, I &s;hould be glad of your Opinion as to the following Queries, viz.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Richer and Abler Per&s;ons and Families,</HI> would abate con&s;iderably of their <HI>Rich needle&s;s fineries, and co&s;tly way of living;</HI> therein giving a <HI>leading Example</HI> to Inferiors?</P>
<P>IF needle&s;s Extravagant Expences at <HI>Wed|dings &amp; Funerals</HI> were retrench'd; and no <HI>Gloves</HI> but of our own make, given at either; nor <HI>Drink</HI> at Funerals but of our <HI>own produce;</HI> nor <HI>Scarves</HI> but for Per&s;ons of &s;ome <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h'd drunk?</HI></P>
<P>IF <HI>Coun&s;ellors, Mini&s;ters, Militay Commi&s;&s;ion Officers,</HI> would <HI>purpo&s;ely</HI> wear <HI>Garments, Shoes, Stockings, Gloves, Hatts,</HI> (as &s;oon as they can get 'em) of our <HI>own make?</HI></P>
<P>IF con&s;iderable encouragement were given
<PB N="16" REF="002067_0016_0FBB7926960E6C60">
by the <HI>Publick</HI> for the <HI>Rai&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Manufactur|ing</HI> of <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax,</HI> e&s;pecially that the <HI>Poor</HI> in <HI>Town and Country</HI> might be <HI>Employ'd;</HI> and for <HI>Manufacturing of Iron,</HI> (whereof there is plenty of <HI>Oar</HI> in the Land,) e&s;pecially in Ca&s;t|ing <HI>Potts, Kettles,</HI> making <HI>Nails</HI> of various &s;orts, &amp;c.?</P>
<P>IF <HI>Wa&s;te Lands</HI> within Town&s;hips were Tax'd, to make the Owners them&s;elves <HI>Improve</HI> 'em, or <HI>Sell</HI> 'em to tho&s;e that would, for the produ|cing <HI>more plenty</HI> of <HI>Grain, Fle&s;h, Butter, Chee&s;e, Wool,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHETHER the&s;e Methods would not be of Publick Service?</P>
<P>BUT as to my own Opinion, 'tis in &s;hort what I &s;aid before, to <HI>rai&s;e what we can </HI> by our own labour, to &s;upply our &s;elves, and to buy no more than <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> requires of <HI>Imported Goods,</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;ure way to relieve us.</P>
