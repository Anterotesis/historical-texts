<Q>OF ZEBULUN SUCH AS WENT FORTH TO BATTLE, EX|PERT IN WAR, WITH ALL INSTRUMENTS OF WAR, FIFTY THOUSAND, WHICH COULD KEEP RANK: THEY WERE NOT OF DOUBLE HEART.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with the virtues and exploits of <HI>David,</HI> that they gene|rally united, upon the death of <HI>Saul,</HI> and the defeat of his rivals, to rai&s;e him to the throne. They ac|cordingly &s;ent to him at <HI>Hebron</HI> a cho&s;en band out of each tribe, to te&s;tify their readine&s;s to &s;upport him again&s;t any attempt to hinder his exaltation. Their country had long &s;marted under foreign and civil wars, and they anxiou&s;ly expected more happy days under the admini&s;tration of a Monarch wi&s;e, pious, and brave.</P>
<P>THE zeal of the tribe of <HI>Zebulun</HI> was con&s;picuous on the occa&s;ion. <HI>Fifty thou&s;and</HI> of its citizens, with arms in their hands, marched to the capital. The&s;e appear to have been the flower of the militia. They were "<HI>&s;uch as went forth to battle, expert in war.</HI>" Either they had been actually tried in the &s;ea&s;on of danger, and
<PB N="4" REF="022576_0003_0FB984A66DBBAC10">
their courage and di&s;cipline had been proved in bat|tle; or they had paid &s;uch attention to the art mili|tary, that they were &s;ufficiently trained to contend with the foes of their country. They were accord|ingly prepared to fight, &s;hould events require it.</P>
<P>THEY were properly &s;killed in the duties of the &s;oldier, and were expert in tho&s;e evolutions, which were nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ful conduct of war. Though the civil wars appeared to cea&s;e by the con|&s;ent of all parties to acknowledge <HI>David</HI> King, and no public enemy appeared in the land, &s;ome foreign power, or dome&s;tic u&s;urper, might take advantage of a &s;tate of general &s;ecurity, and attempt to &s;trike a fatal blow. They went, therefore, prepared for the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>THEY were completely armed, and did not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be deficient in a &s;ingle article. They marched "<HI>with all in&s;truments of war.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE &s;hield, the helmet, the bow, the &s;ling, the &s;pear, and the &s;word, were the arms of their age and nation. The&s;e were naturally pre&s;erved in bright and excel|lent order by a people of &s;uch military ta&s;te. They would not allow ru&s;t to canker them, or du&s;t to tar|ni&s;h their beauty. Yet, while they took a due care of the appearance of their arms, they would be more attentive to have them fit for u&s;e, than for &s;hew. The vain &s;oldier, who preferred ornament to bravery and di&s;cipline, would have been an object of their ju&s;t and

</LG>
<BIBL><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"></BIBL></NOTE> When the Per&s;ians became e|nervated with plea&s;ure, and relaxed in di&s;cipline, they were &s;trangers to that martial &s;pirit, which in&s;pired the people of <HI>Zebulun.</HI> They de&s;pi&s;ed the plain but u&s;eful armour of their brave ance&s;tors, and adorned them&s;elves before battle with gold and jewels. The&s;e &s;erved only to convince the rough Grecians of their lo&s;s of their manly feelings, and to urge them more forcibly, to an irre&s;i&s;tible and gainful attack.</P>
<P>THE troops of <HI>Zebulun</HI> not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed "<HI>all in&s;tru|ments of war,</HI>" but they knew how to u&s;e them to the be&s;t advantage. They were &s;killed in the various branches of military di&s;cipline. They marched in regular array, and "<HI>could keep rank</HI>" in the field. They felt the importance of order and uniformity in their movements, and of attacking or maintaining the &s;hock of an enemy, with a &s;teady, unbroken front. Each &s;oldier carefully kept the &s;tation a&s;&s;igned him, and marched, or countermarched, charged, or retreat|ed, with a firm and regular &s;tep, according to the word of command.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred <HI>Chronicle</HI> clo&s;es the account with a con|ci&s;e and expre&s;&s;ive delineation of their character: "<HI>They were not of double heart.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="022576_0005_0FB984B057DD0628">
THEY were &s;incerely and con&s;cientiou&s;ly attached to the cau&s;e in which they were engaged. The He|brew phra&s;e, literally tran&s;lated, is, they had "<HI>not a heart and a heart.</HI>" They had not one heart, warm and loud in its loyal, patriotic expre&s;&s;ions, and ano|ther heart, more concealed, &s;elfi&s;h, incon&s;tant, and de|ceitful. They were attached, by a principle of ho|nour and love, to the late revolution in government, which placed the brave and pious <HI>David</HI> on the throne. They were not mercenary &s;oldiers, follow|ing the &s;tandard of ambitious leaders, for plunder or pay. They were the freemen, the citizens of the &s;tate, who viewed their religion, their wives, their children, their property, involved in the liberty, the &s;afety, and the regular government of their country.</P>
<P>THEY had not forgotten the example of their brave ance&s;tors, who, though a &s;mall band, ranged them&s;elves under the &s;tandard of the gallant <HI>Barak,</HI> wre&s;ted <HI>Ju|dea</HI> from the iron yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, and totally de|feated the numerous regular troops of their tyrant, the King of <HI>Canaan.</HI> They recollected the panegyric &s;trains of the Jewi&s;h Prophete&s;s and Heroine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the context.</NOTE> "<HI>Ze|bulun</HI> and <HI>Naphtali</HI> were a people, that jeoparded their lives unto the death, in the high places of the field." They wi&s;hed to emulate their patrioti&s;m and military virtues, and welcomed fatigue and danger, if they might but perpetuate the felicity of the nation. Their generous &s;ouls &s;purned the idea of duplicity,
<PB N="7" REF="022576_0006_0FB984B5803C2A58">
and they were willing to &s;eal their attachment to the cau&s;e, which they had e&s;pou&s;ed, with their blood.</P>
<P>How happy then mu&s;t the&s;e loyal and virtuous ci|tizens be, to find their brethren flocking into <HI>Hebron,</HI> from the other tribes, upon the &s;ame de&s;ign! How plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve di&s;cord withdraw her&s;elf from the &s;cene, and every eye &s;parkling with joy, at the clo&s;e of their civil wars, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a <HI>fir&s;t Magi&s;trate,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the happy talent of ruling in the hearts of the people!&mdash;</P>
<P>THE intire unanimity in this va&s;t military body, and the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Song of <HI>Deborah.</HI></NOTE> "<HI>onene&s;s of heart in all the re&s;t of I&s;rael,</HI>" without exception, "<HI>to make</HI> David <HI>King,</HI>" exhibited him as evidently de&s;ignated by Heaven to his high office.</P>
<P>THEY could not forbear mutual congratulations on their pre&s;ent pro&s;pects. Men, who were <HI>not of double heart,</HI> who &s;incerely &s;ought the public honour and pro&s;perity, could not but felicitate them&s;elves on the peaceable e&s;tabli&s;hment of their new Monarch. He became the common centre of their affections. Party|&s;pirit was con&s;equently bani&s;hed, and they viewed them&s;elves as brethren of one great family, who&s;e duty and glory it was, to imitate the virtues of their royal Sire.</P>
<P>IT was natural for them, therefore, to keep a joyful fe&s;tival on the occa&s;ion&mdash;"<HI>Bread and milk, cakes of
<PB N="8" REF="022576_0007_0FB984B6EF1F4F08">
figs, and bunches of rai&s;ins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and &s;heep,</HI>" were prepared "<HI>abundantly,</HI>" for the whole multitude: "<HI>For there was joy in I&s;rael.</HI> Neither need we be &s;urpri&s;ed, that <HI>"David," their late gene|ral,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the difficulties with which he had &s;truggled, and the dark clouds which &s;o oft ob|&s;cured his horizon, "<HI>waxed greater and greater; for the Lord of ho&s;ts was with him.</HI>"</P>
<P>OUR text holds up to view the duties and virtues, which claim the attention of the military character.</P>
<P>HAPPY would it be, my brethren, if rea&s;on or reli|gion laid &s;uch re&s;traints upon the pa&s;&s;ions of men, that it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to have any knowledge of the u&s;e of arms! But, as the pre&s;ent degenerate condition of human nature renders this knowledge ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, to protect a country again&s;t bands of public robbers and murderers, who con&s;i|der them&s;elves legally authorized by their employers, to deal de&s;truction around them, and to wre&s;t the property and immunities of the citizens from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it is not un&s;uitable, to devote an anni|ver&s;ary to the &s;erious con&s;ideration of the character, and duties of a patriot &s;oldier.</P>
<P>AND when a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel reflects, on &s;uch an anniver&s;ary, that he is not addre&s;&s;ing a band of mercenaries, who make war their trade, but a &s;elect body of independent citizens, who are chiefly con|ver&s;ant with the duties of civil life, and who are in|corporated to defend the land of their nativity again&s;t

lawle&s;s inva&s;ions, to &s;eek its <HI>true glory,</HI> and to ce|ment the ties of friend&s;hip among them&s;elves; he may con&s;ider the occa&s;ion, not wholly foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;tation.</P>
<P>IF the primitive chri&s;tians faithfully followed the &s;tandard of their <HI>Heathen Emperors,</HI> and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, that they might te&s;|tify their loyalty at the hazard of life; much more may we pay a temporary attention to military &s;cience to enable us to maintain the <HI>civil and religious rights</HI> of a <HI>free chri&s;tian republic.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>patriot, chri&s;tian &s;oldier</HI> will cordially comply with tho&s;e laws of the Commonwealth, which mark out the line of his profe&s;&s;ion. He will be careful, to provide him&s;elf with a complete military apparatus, and to be expert in the u&s;e of his arms, that he may "<HI>not be a&s;hamed to &s;peak with his enemies in the gate.</HI>" He will be diligent to make proficiency in di&s;cipline. He will <HI>keep rank,</HI> while peace allows him &s;ecurely to practice military evolutions, that he may maintain good order, and a better countenance, when the trump of war &s;ummons him to battle. True courage enables him to adhere to that di&s;cipline, in the day of trial, which he has learnt in a &s;ea&s;on of calmne&s;s and lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE &s;implicity and purity, that reign in his brea&s;t, teach him to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h arguments, which urge the &s;acrifice of the public good to per&s;onal &s;afety or intere&s;t. He &s;hudders at the idea of a double heart, influencing his de&s;igns or conduct. He &s;incerely
<PB N="10" REF="022576_0009_0FB984BF76A666F8">
and ardently loves the cau&s;e and country, to which he has devouted him&s;elf. He knows, that his &s;tation expo&s;es him to danger in the &s;ea&s;on of war. But he remembers, that life was given, to aid him in deeds of patrioti&s;m and virtue. If he has military talents, he believes, that it would be &s;inful <HI>to bury them in a napkin,</HI> and that he is accountable for the neglect of them, when the public honor and &s;afety require their improvement. He knows, that he mu&s;t quit this &s;tage, at the moment decreed by the &s;overeign Ar|biter of human life; and he is de&s;irous of acting his part well, till he is called to other climes and &s;cenes.&mdash;He is more anxious to merit the e&s;teem of the virtuous and the brave, and to make a &s;uitable appli|cation of his powers for the promotion of the general good, than to protract the period of his pre&s;ent exi&s;t|ence. "<HI>Save my country,</HI>" is his fir&s;t and la&s;t reque&s;t to Heaven.</P>
<P>THE <HI>chri&s;tian &s;oldier</HI> affects not to derive any plea|&s;ure from the &s;acking of towns, the de&s;olation of king|doms, or the &s;hrieks of wounded and dying men. His humane heart &s;ighs at the&s;e &s;cenes, and he would rejoice in an honorable opportunity for his &s;word to &s;leep for ever in its &s;cabbard.</P>
<P>WHEN he thinks of an agonizing parent deploring the lo&s;s of a gallant &s;on, who can never more &s;hare his affectionate &s;miles&mdash;of the pale virgin, &s;ighing in vain for the return of her faithful lover, whom the fatal ball or piercing &s;teel forbid to realize pa&s;t fond

dreams of conjugal felicity, under the roof of peace&mdash;of the helple&s;s widow bewailing her &s;lain hu&s;band, and her tender off&s;pring a&s;king, with weeping eyes, for a father who once gave them bread;&mdash;he can drop a tear, even over a <HI>fallen foe.</HI></P>
<P>HIS own private glory or emolument are not &s;uffi|cient, in his view, to induce him to harbour a &s;ingle wi&s;h for war. He is reluctant at the thought of draw|ing his &s;word, unle&s;s the liberty and &s;afety of his country urge.</P>
<P>BUT when the&s;e call him to the field, he cheerfully complies with the &s;ummons. He is willing to com|mand, or obey, as his duty and &s;tation prompt. Con|fident of the goodne&s;s of a cau&s;e, which he has ma|turely weighed, and committing it, and him&s;elf to the patronage of the GOD <HI>of armies,</HI> the <HI>Fautor</HI> of ju&s;|tice, he directs his unwearied efforts, to promote the great object. He is ready to encounter fatigue, wounds, and death, with a cool determined courage, to repel the bold invader, and to e&s;tabli&s;h, on a per|manent ba&s;is, the rights and privileges of the re|public.</P>
<P>SHOULD the <HI>chri&s;tian &s;oldier</HI> fall in his attempts to &s;erve his country, he believes, that he falls not, un|noticed, by the Father of &s;pirits. He has made him the object of his tru&s;t and love. He has often adopt|ed the language of the Jewi&s;h Hero.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alms XXVII. 1.</NOTE><Q><HI>The Lord is my

light and my &s;alvation; whom &s;hall I fear? The Lord is the &s;trength of my life; of whom &s;hall I be afraid?</HI></Q>&mdash;He is willing to be di&s;charged from his earthly labours, as the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of Heaven may determine. He remembers the animating promi&s;e of his divine Captain,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. II. 10.</NOTE> <Q><HI>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI></Q>&mdash;Cheerful, at his call, his &s;pirit wings its way to tho&s;e purer climes, where all the citizens live in perfect harmony, where, in&s;tead of the rude din of arms, <Q><HI>joy and gladne&s;s &s;hall be found, thank&s;giving and the voice of</HI> perpetual <HI>melody.</HI></Q></P>
<P>How nece&s;&s;ary then is the aid of revealed religion, to render the military character complete!&mdash;While it reprobates the <Q><HI>double minded man, as un&s;table in all his ways,</HI></Q> it teaches that purity, &s;incerity, and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of &s;oul, which are requi&s;ite to a faith|ful di&s;charge of duty in every &s;tation. While it leads us to a careful eradication of tho&s;e <Q><HI>lu&s;ts, from which</HI> unju&s;t <HI>wars and fightings ari&s;e,</HI></Q> it affords the be&s;t motives to courage and fidelity, in cru&s;hing the at|tempts of men, in whom the&s;e lu&s;ts predominate.</P>
<P>IT exhibits a bright catalogue of military worthies, who in different ages, <Q><HI>played the men for their God, and the cities of their God.</HI></Q> It animates with the example of an <HI>Abraham,</HI> a <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> a <HI>Caleh,</HI> a <HI>Jonathan,</HI> a <HI>David,</HI> a <HI>Jeho&s;aphat,</HI> a <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in whom piety and bravery &s;hone illu&s;trious.

XII. 15.</NOTE> <Q><HI>&s;pend and be &s;pent</HI></Q> for the general good, even though we meet with <HI>ungrateful returns.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;oldier, therefore, who acts under the eye of his divine Commander, and is influenced by the exam|ples of patrioti&s;m and fortitude, which the &s;acred &s;criptures contain, will not fail to di&s;charge the du|ties of his po&s;t. His exertions will be the re&s;ult of firm un&s;haken virtue, not of mechanical or mercena|ry principles. His country's good will be, in his e&s;|teem, the noble&s;t reward of the&s;e exertions.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject will be clo&s;ed with a few reflections, and an addre&s;s to the military gentlemen, at who&s;e reque&s;t we are convened.</P>
<P>How natural is it on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, to lament that depravity of human nature, which has rendered this globe a theatre of de&s;olation in every age, and nece&s;&s;itates the peaceful citizen to cultivate an ac|quaintance with the u&s;e of arms, left he fall a prey to tyranny, ambition or avarice! How oft does the be|nevolent
<PB N="14" REF="022576_0013_0FB984CD4D9708D0">
mind turn abhorrent from the hi&s;tory of na|tions, while its pages appear &s;tained with the blood of millions, and recount little more than a continued and awful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of wars and battles!</P>
<P><Q>IT is agreed, &s;ays Mr. Rollin, that wars, under|taken &s;olely from views of intere&s;t or ambition, are real robberies.</Q></P>
<P>BUT an impartial &s;pectator will generally perceive nations actuated by the&s;e views in their contentions. To enlarge the boundaries of an empire, already of &s;uf|ficient extent for the maintenance of a peaceable and regular government&mdash;to gain &s;ome favorite point of honor, which, when gained, is but an empty name, or to re&s;ent &s;ome affront, which is always more tolerable than the calamities of war, and which is often too in|&s;ignificant to engage the &s;erious attention of chil|dren; de&s;olation is commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;pread wide her ravages, and torrents of human blood mu&s;t be delibe|rately &s;hed.</P>
<P>How fallen, then, is man, &s;elfi&s;h, de&s;troying man, from his original perfection! "<HI>God made him upright,</HI>" and gave him the law of love for his guide. "<HI>But he hath &s;ought out many</HI>" wanton "<HI>inventions,</HI>" foreign to the purity and benevolence of religion.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel explicitly requires us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb.

<P>WHILE unbridled &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s pre&s;ides in human councils, and nations confine their regards <HI>&s;olely</HI> to them&s;elves, vain will be all human &s;chemes, however benevolent in their orign, to bani&s;h war from our globe. A divine influence, powerfully impre&s;&s;ed on the hearts of mankind, will alone effectually teach them genuine philanthropy, and induce them to live and love as brethren.</P>
<P>How &s;oothing then, how tran&s;porting the idea, to the humane, the chri&s;tian bo&s;om, that the period ra|pidly rolls on, when this influence, with concurring providential events, &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h the golden age of the world,&mdash;when "the nations &s;hall not learn war any more"&mdash;when "Ephraim &s;hall not envy Judah, nor Judah vex Ephraim"&mdash;when "<HI>the righteous,</HI>" ru|lers and their &s;ubjects, jointly under the influence of religion, "<HI>&s;hall flouri&s;h, and abundance of peace, &s;o long as the moon endureth.</HI>"</P>
<P>BUT I ha&s;ten to clo&s;e the &s;ubject by a particular ad|dre&s;s to the worthy gentlemen, who compo&s;e the mili|tary body before us.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>AT the reque&s;t of your ANCIENT AND HONORABLE SOCIETY, I have attempted to addre&s;s you on the du|ties, and objects of your profe&s;&s;ion. A century and a
<PB N="16" REF="022576_0015_0FB984D10D948060">
half of years have revolved &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of your company by our brave and venerable ance&s;|tors. The pure&s;t patrioti&s;m induced the mea&s;ure of incorporating a &s;ociety of re&s;pectable citizens, who &s;hould be viewed as the flower of the militia, and a &s;chool for the diffu&s;ion of military knowledge in New-England.</P>
<P>To defend their country again&s;t the ravages of her enemies; to protect the civil and religious rights of the people, was their leading motive.</P>
<P>THEY were too much under the influence of a ju&s;t and benevolent religion, to indulge a wi&s;h for an occa|&s;ion to di&s;play their &s;kill and courage in the rough bu|&s;ine&s;s of war. But they believed it their duty, to u&s;e the be&s;t means in their power, for the protection of a country, in the &s;ettlement of which the providence of the <HI>Almighty</HI> had &s;o vi&s;ibly interpo&s;ed, and where they enjoyed tho&s;e immunities, that were dearer than life.</P>
<P>UUINFLUENCED by ambition or inju&s;tice, and in&s;pir|ed with a zeal for the public good, they e&s;tabli&s;hed a military in&s;titution, the beneficial effects of which might be felt in &s;ub&s;equent years, and ages.</P>
<P>POSTERITY approved the plan, and the children have ri&s;en up &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the room of their fathers, to pro&s;ecute it.</P>
<P>THE faire&s;t names in New-England have graced your military rolls. Each &s;ucceeding generation has &s;een, in your number, men, in&s;pired with the pure&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="022576_0016_0FB984D4CD07E830">
principles of philanthropy, men, who derived their courage from a &s;incere confidence in the <HI>Lord of ho&s;ts,</HI> and who e&s;teemed it their highe&s;t honor to approve them&s;elves "<HI>good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>" Each ge|neration has had occa&s;ion to admire the pure republi|cani&s;m of your in&s;titution, while officers of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction have conde&s;cended to enter the ranks, and di&s;charge the duties of a private centinel, to &s;tamp a dignity on the &s;tation of a <HI>patriot &s;oldier.</HI></P>
<P>WITH plea&s;ure we ob&s;erve the pre&s;ent re&s;pectability of your company, and men of worth, in the various departments of life, uniting in the friendly di&s;charge of the military office.</P>
<P>YOUR appearance, on this anniver&s;ary of your elec|tion, exhibits an agreeable epitome, and illu&s;tration of our text. The &s;tate of your arms and di&s;cipline gives you an honorable re&s;emblance to the warlike and patriotic tribe, depicted by the &s;acred hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>LIKE the military citizens of Zebulun, you profe&s;s to de&s;pi&s;e <HI>a double heart,</HI> to be actuated by the pure&s;t love of your country.</P>
<P>WE rejoice to behold among you men, who "have jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field," who&s;e courage, coolne&s;s, and di&s;cipline have been con|&s;picuous on eminent occa&s;ions, and who have contribut|ed largely to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our national military character, and the independence of the <HI>United States of America.</HI> Your company has di&s;covered the mo&s;t un|equivocal
<PB N="18" REF="022576_0017_0FB984DA81885198">
attachment to tho&s;e tried worthies, who fought our battles, and by their valour and di&s;cipline, under God, have wrought out our political &s;alvation. If the&s;e have been forgotten, <HI>after the hour of danger,</HI> by &s;ome, who once eyed, and invocated them as the &s;a|viours of the land, you have evidenced that you are <HI>not of double heart,</HI> by the fulle&s;t tokens of your e&s;teem and gratitude. While it mu&s;t give you a generous plea|&s;ure, to te&s;tify your veneration, by adding &s;ome of their names to the bright catalogue of your leaders, they mu&s;t be in&s;pired with the warme&s;t affection for the &s;ociety: And your proficiency in di&s;cipline, un|der their eye, mu&s;t reflect mutual honor, and &s;ati&s;fac|tion.</P>
<P>IT is a plea&s;ing circum&s;tance, that it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary, to point you to the numerous worthies of an|tient Rome, or to bring to your view the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing talents and virtues of a CAMILLUS, a CINCINNA|TUS, a FABIUS, a REGULUS, the DECII, the SCIPIOS, and other eminent characters in your line. Your own hi&s;tory will furni&s;h you with heroes, who de&s;erve your imitation.</P>
<P>EMULATE then the civil and religious virtues of your honorable fathers, who have trodden in the &s;teps, in which you are called to follow them. Let <HI>your more noble, enlarged object</HI> &s;timulate you to pre&s;erve, to in|crea&s;e the re&s;pectability, the u&s;efulne&s;s of a company, which was fir&s;t in&s;tituted to defend a part of <HI>the de|pendent territories of Britain,</HI> but is now invited and engaged to extend its a&s;&s;i&s;ting arm in behalf of <HI>a ri&s;ing,

independent, and exten&s;ive empire.</HI> But, while you re|member, with admiration, your valiant ance&s;tors, and the heroes, who have trodden the &s;tage in the late war; while you cea&s;e not to revere your exalted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Excellency <HI>John Hancock.</HI> E&s;q.</NOTE> <HI>Commander in Chief,</HI> who&s;e illu&s;trious qualities, and engaging be|neficent virtues, as a <HI>Patriot,</HI> a <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> and a <HI>Citi|zen,</HI> are too well known, to need a di&s;tinct enumera|tion;&mdash;your bo&s;om &s;hould beat gratitude to that <HI>Pro|vidence,</HI> which has allowed you to contemplate the brighte&s;t military pattern, which, perhaps, was ever exhibited to human view. A WASHINGTON, like David of ancient days, has been placed by the unanimous voice of his country at the head of her <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>military</HI> go|vernment. Our General in war, is our Leader in peace.</P>
<P>EAGERLY catch that military &s;pirit, which &s;ired his early youth, and has not yet cea&s;ed to glow in his bo&s;om. Ponder tho&s;e <HI>chri&s;tian virtues,</HI> which reflect the bright|e&s;t &s;plendor on his character, and qualify him for that <HI>"crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s," which alone can pay, and more than pay,</HI> the debt due from his country. Think of his piety and patrioti&s;m, which have been invariably combined with his exalted talents to ble&s;s it, and to ex|hibit an in&s;tructive example for the imitation of heroes in every nation and age.</P>
<P>WHILE then, by your &s;edulous improvements in di&s;cipline, you, with your other worthy brethren of the militia, te&s;tify your attention to his important ob&s;er|vation: "The Militia of this country mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered

<P>WHEN this prayer is effectually heard by that gra|cious Being who "<HI>has all hearts in his hand,</HI>" AME|RICA will be adorned with a new glory, reflected from the in&s;piring example of her Chief; and the FATHER <HI>of the&s;e States</HI> &s;hall live, when dead, in the re&s;embling lineaments of his children.</P>
<P>LONG, long may he &s;urvive to ble&s;s us by his exam|ple, his prayers, and the continued efforts of his wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s!

May he live to &s;ee &s;till brighter days dawn on his country, to &s;ee LIBERTY and PEACE, accompanied by PURE RELIGION, go forth from the&s;e favored climes, to ble&s;s a WORLD!</P>
