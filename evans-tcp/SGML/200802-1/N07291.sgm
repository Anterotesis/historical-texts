<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALL our Actions are of like Nature with their Root; and the Mo&s;t High weigheth them more &s;kilfully than Men can weigh them one for another.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I believe that one Supreme Being made and &s;up|ports the World; nor can I wor&s;hip any other Deity without being an Idolater, and guilty of Wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Many Nations have believed in, and wor&s;hipped a Plurality of Deities; but I do not believe they were therefore all wicked.&mdash;Idolatry indeed is Wick|edne&s;s; but it is the Thing, not the Name, which is &s;o. Real Idolatry is to pay that Adoration to a Creature, which is known to be due only to the true</HI> GOD.</P>
<P><HI>He who profe&s;&s;eth to believe in one Almighty Cre|ator, and in his Son</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and is yet more intent on the Honours, Profits and Friend&s;hips of the World, than he is in Singlene&s;s of Heart to</HI> &s;tand faithful to the Chri&s;tian Religion, <HI>is in the Channel of Idolatry; while the</HI> Gentile, <HI>who, under &s;ome mi&s;taken Opinions, is notwith&s;tanding e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in the true Principle of Virtue, and humbly adores an Almighty Power, may be of that Number who fear</HI> GOD, <HI>and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="009314_0003_1030DEF0DCFF7A28">
<HI>I believe the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Rome <HI>a&s;&s;umes a Power, that does not belong to any Officer in the Church of</HI> CHRIST; <HI>and if I &s;hould knowingly do any Thing, tending to &s;trengthen him in that Capacity, it would be great Iniquity. There are many Thou&s;ands of People, who by their Profe&s;&s;ion acknowledge him to be the Repre&s;entative of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>on Earth; and to &s;ay that none of them are upright in Heart, would be contrary to my Sentiments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Men who &s;incerely apply their Minds to true Vir|tue, and find an inward Support from above, by which all vicious Inclinations are made &s;ubject; that they love</HI> GOD <HI>&s;incerely, and prefer the real Good of Mankind univer&s;ally to their own private Intere&s;t; though the&s;e, through the Strength of Education and Tradition, may remain under &s;ome &s;peculative and great Errors, it would be uncharitable to &s;ay, that therefore</HI> GOD <HI>rejects them.&mdash;He who creates, &s;upports and gives Under&s;tanding to all Men, his Knowledge and Goodne&s;s is &s;uperior to the various Ca&s;es and Circum&s;tances of his Creatures, which to as appear the mo&s;t difficult.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Apo&s;tles and primitive Chri&s;tians did not cen|&s;ure all the</HI> Gentiles <HI>as wicked Men,</HI> Rom. ii. 14. Col. iii. 2. <HI>but as they were favoured with a Gift to di&s;cern Things more clearly, re&s;pecting the Wor|&s;hip of the true</HI> GOD, <HI>they with much Firmne&s;s de|clared again&s;t the wor&s;hiping of Idols; and with true Patience endured many Sufferings, on that Account.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Great Numbers of faithful Prote&s;tants have con|tended for the Truth, in Oppo&s;ition to</HI> Papal <HI>Errors; and with true Fortitude laid down their Lives in
<PB N="5" REF="009314_0004_1030DEF279112180">
the Conflict, without &s;aying, That no Man was &s;aved who made Profe&s;&s;ion of that Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>While we have no Right to keep Men as Servants for Term of Life, but that of &s;uperior Power; to do th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, with De&s;ign by their Labour to profit our|&s;elves and our Families, I believe is wrong; but I do not believe that all who have kept Slaves, have therefore been chargeable with Guilt. If their Mo|tives thereto were free from Selfi&s;hne&s;s, and their Slaves content, they were a Sort of Freemen; which I believe hath &s;ometimes been the Ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whatever a Man does in the Spirit of Charity, to him it is not Sin: And while he lives and acts in this Spirit, he learns all Things e&s;&s;ential to his Hap|pine&s;s, as an Individual: And if he doth not &s;ee that any Injury or Inju&s;tice, to any other Per&s;on, is nece&s;&s;arily promoted by any Part of his Form of Go|vernment, I believe the merciful Judge will not lay Iniquity to his Charge. Yet others, who live in the &s;ame Spirit of Charity, from a clear Convincement, may &s;ee the Relation of one Thing to another, and the nece&s;&s;ary Tendency of each; and hence it may be ab&s;olutely binding on them to de&s;i&s;t from &s;ome Parts of Conduct, which &s;ome good Men have been in.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS ON KEEPING NEGROES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;ome in mo&s;t religious Societies a|mong&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are concerned in importing or purcha&s;ing the Inhabitants of <HI>Africa</HI> as Slaves; and as the Profe&s;|&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity of &s;everal other Nations do the like; the&s;e Circum&s;tances tend to make Peo|ple le&s;s apt to examine the Practice &s;o clo&s;ely as they would, if &s;uch a Thing had not been, but was now propo&s;ed to be entered upon. It is however our Duty, and what concerns us indi|vidually, as Creatures accountable to our Creator, to employ rightly the Under&s;tanding which he hath given us, in humbly endeavouring to be ac|quainted with his Will concerning us, and with the Nature and Tendency of tho&s;e Things which we practi&s;e: For as Ju&s;tice remains to be Ju&s;tice, &s;o many People, of Reputation in the World, joining with wrong Things, do not excu&s;e others in joining with them, nor make the Con&s;equence of their Proceedings le&s;s dreadful in the final I&s;|&s;ue, than it would be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009314_0006_103031DC8925A108">
WHERE Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is ju&s;tified from one Age to another, it is like dark Matter gathering into Clouds over us. We may know that this G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oom will remain till the Cau&s;e be removed by a Reformation, or Change of Times; and may feel a De&s;ire, from a Love of Equity, &s;o &s;peak on the Occa&s;ion; yet where Error is &s;o &s;trong, that it may not be &s;poken again&s;t without &s;ome Pro&s;pect of Inconvenience to the Speaker, this Difficulty is likely to operate on our Weakne&s;s, and quench the good De&s;ires in us; except we dwell &s;o &s;teadily under the Weight of it, as to be made willing to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s</HI> on that Account.</P>
<P>WHERE Men exert their Talents again&s;t Vi|ces generally accounted &s;uch, the ill Effects whereof are pre&s;ently perceived in a Government, all Men who regard their own temporal Good, are likely to approve the Work. But when that which is incon&s;i&s;tent with perfect Equity, hath the Law, or Countenance of the Great in its Fa|vour, though the Tendency thereof be quite contrary to the true Happine&s;s of Mankind in an equal, if not greater, Degree, than many Things accounted reproachful to Chri&s;tians; yet as the&s;e ill Effects are not generally perceived, they who labour to di&s;&s;uade from &s;uch Things, which People believe accord with their Intere&s;t, have many Difficulties to encounter.</P>
<P>THE repeated Charges, which GOD gave to his Prophets, imply the Danger they were in of erring on this Hand. <HI>Be not afraid of their Faces; for I am with thee, to deliver thee, faith the Lord,</HI> Jer. i. 8. <HI>Speak all the Words that I
<PB N="9" REF="009314_0007_103031DE52061708">
command thee to &s;peak to them; dimini&s;h not a Word,</HI> Jer. xxvi. 2. <HI>And thou Son of Man, be not afraid of them, nor di&s;mayed at their Looks. Speak my Words to them, whether they will hear or forbear,</HI> Ezek. ii. 6.</P>
<P>UNDER an Apprehen&s;ion of Duty, I offer &s;ome further Con&s;iderations on this Subject, having endeavoured &s;ome Years to con&s;ider it candidly. I have ob&s;erved People of our own Co|lour, who&s;e Abilities have been inferior to the Affairs which relate to their convenient Sub|&s;i&s;tence, who have been taken Care of by others, and the Profit of &s;uch Work as they could do, applied toward their Support.&mdash;I believe there are &s;uch among&s;t <HI>Negroes;</HI> and that &s;ome People, in who&s;e Hands they are, keep them with no View of outward Profit, do not con&s;ider them as black Men, who, as &s;uch, ought to &s;erve white Men; but account them Per&s;ons who have Need of Guardians, and as &s;uch take Care of them: Yet where equal Care is taken in all Parts of Education, I do not apprehend Ca&s;es of this Sort are likely to occur more frequently among&s;t one Sort of People than another.</P>
<P>IT looks to me that the Slave Trade was founded, and hath generally been carried on, in a wrong Spirit; that the Effects of it are detri|mental to the real Pro&s;perity of our Country; and will be more &s;o, except we cea&s;e from the common Motives of keeping them, and treat them in future agreeable to Truth and pure Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Negroes</HI> may be imported, who, for their Cruelty to their Countrymen, and the evil Di&s;|po&s;ition
<PB N="10" REF="009314_0008_103031E020F47660">
of their Minds, may be unfit to be at Liberty; and if we, as Lovers of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, undertake the Management of them, we &s;hould have a full and clear Knowledge of their Crimes, and of tho&s;e Circum&s;tances which might operate in their Favour; but the Difficulty of obtaining this is &s;o great, that we have great Rea&s;on to be cautious therein. But, &s;hould it plainly appear that ab&s;olute Subjection were a Condition the mo&s;t proper for the Per&s;on who is purcha&s;ed, yet the innocent Children ought not to be made Slaves, becau&s;e their Parents &s;inned.</P>
<P>WE have Account in Holy Scripture of &s;ome Families &s;uffering, where mention is only made of the Heads of the Family committing Wicked|ne&s;s; and it is likely that the degenerate <HI>Jews,</HI> mi&s;under&s;tanding &s;ome Occurrences of this Kind, took Occa&s;ion to charge GOD with being unequal; &s;o that a Saying became common, <HI>The Fathers have eaten four Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are &s;et on Edge. Jeremiah</HI> and <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> two of the in&s;pired Prophets, who lived near the &s;ame Time, were concerned to correct this Error. <HI>Ezekiel</HI> is large on the Subject. Fir&s;t, he re|proves them for their Error. <HI>What mean ye, that ye do &s;o,</HI> Chap. xviii. Ver&s;e 1. <HI>As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, ye &s;hall not have Occa&s;ion any more to u&s;e this Proverb in I&s;rael.</HI> The Words, <HI>any more,</HI> have Reference to Time pa&s;t; intimating, that though they had not rightly under&s;tood &s;ome Things they had heard or &s;een, and thence &s;up|po&s;ed the Proverb to be well grounded; yet henceforth they might know of a Certainty, that
<PB N="11" REF="009314_0009_103031F1504D7A28">
the Ways of GOD are all equal; that as &s;ure as the Mo&s;t High liveth, &s;o &s;ure Men are only an&s;werable for their own Sins.&mdash;He thus &s;ums up the Matter; <HI>The Soul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die. The Son &s;hall not bear the Iniquity of the Father; neither &s;hall the Father bear the Iniquity of the Son. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Righteous &s;hall be upon him; and the Wickedne&s;s of the Wicked &s;hall be upon him.</HI></P>
<P>WHERE Men are wicked, they commonly are a Means of corrupting the &s;ucceeding Age; and thereby ha&s;ten tho&s;e outward Calamities, which fall on Nations, when their Iniquities are full.</P>
<P>MEN may pur&s;ue Means which are not agree|able to perfect Purity, with a View to increa&s;e the Wealth and Happine&s;s of their Offspring, and thereby make the Way of Virtue more difficult to them. And though the ill Example of a Pa|rent, or a Multitude, does not excu&s;e a Man in doing Evil, yet the Mind being early impre&s;&s;ed with vicious Notions and Practices, and nurtured up in Ways of getting Trea&s;ure, which are not the Ways of Truth; this wrong Spirit getting fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and being thus &s;trengthened, fre|quently prevents due Attention to the true Spirit of Wi&s;dom, &s;o that they exceed in Wickedne&s;s tho&s;e before them. And in this Channel, though Parents labour, as they think, to forward the Happine&s;s of their Children, it proves a Means of forwarding their Calamity. This being the Ca&s;e in the Age next before the grievous Calamity in the Siege of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and carrying <HI>Judah</HI> Cap|tive to <HI>Babylon,</HI> they might &s;ay with Propriety, This came upon us, becau&s;e our Fathers for&s;ook
<PB N="12" REF="009314_0010_103031F30F7E08B0">
GOD, and becau&s;e we did wor&s;e than our Fa|thers.</P>
<P>As the Generation next before them inwardly turned away from GOD, who yet waited to be gracious; and as they in that Age continued in tho&s;e Things which nece&s;&s;arily &s;eparated from perfect Goodne&s;s, growing more &s;tubborn, till the Judgments of GOD were poured out upon them; they might properly &s;ay, <HI>Our Fathers have &s;inned, and we have borne their Iniquities:</HI> And yet, wick|ed as their Fathers were, had they not &s;ucceeded them in their Wickedne&s;s, they had not borne their Iniquities.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e it right, that an innocent Man &s;hall at this Day be excluded from the common Rules of Ju&s;tice; be deprived of that Liberty, which is the natural Right of human Creatures; and be a Slave to others during Life, on Account of a Sin committed by his immediate Parents; or a Sin committed by <HI>Ham,</HI> the Son of <HI>Noah;</HI> is a Suppo&s;ition too gro&s;s to be admitted into the Mind of any Per&s;on, who &s;incerely de&s;ires to be go|verned by &s;olid Principles.</P>
<P>IT is alledged, in Favour of the Practice, that <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> made Slaves of the <HI>Gibeonites.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT Men do by the Command of GOD, and what comes to pa&s;s as a Con&s;equence of their Neglect, are different; &s;uch as the latter Ca&s;e now mentioned was.</P>
<P>IT was the expre&s;s Command of the Almighty to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> concerning the Inhabitants of the pro|mi&s;ed Land, <HI>Thou &s;halt make no Covenant with them, nor with their Gods: They &s;hall not dwell in
<PB N="13" REF="009314_0011_103031F5E92A7B90">
thy Land.</HI> Exod. xxiii. 32. Tho&s;e <HI>Gibeonites</HI> came craftily, telling <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> that they were come from a far Country; that their Elders had &s;ent them to make a League with the People of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and as an Evidence of their being Foreigners, &s;hewed their old Cloaths, &amp;<HI>c. And the Men took of their Victuals, and a&s;ked not Coun&s;el at the Mouth of the Lord; and</HI> Jo&s;hua <HI>made Peace with them, and made a League with them, to let them live; and the Princes &s;ware to them.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Impo&s;ition was di&s;covered, the Con|gregation murmured again&s;t the Princes: <HI>But all the Princes &s;aid to all the Congregation, we have &s;worn to them by the Lord God of I&s;rael; now there|fore we may not touch them; we will even let them live, let Wrath be upon us; but let them be Hew|ers of Wood, and Drawers of Water unto the Con|gregation.</HI></P>
<P>OMITTING to a&s;k Coun&s;el, involved them in great Difficulty. The <HI>Gibeonites</HI> were of tho&s;e Cities, of which the LORD &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;ave alive nothing that breatheth;</HI> and of the Stock of the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ites,</HI> concerning whom he commanded by Name, <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;mite them, and utterly de|&s;troy them: Thou &s;halt make no Covenant with them, nor &s;hew Mercy unto them,</HI> Deut. vii. 1. Thus <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the Princes, not knowing them, had made a League with them, to let them live; and in this Strait they re&s;olve to make them Servants. <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the Princes &s;u&s;pected them to be De|ceivers: <HI>Peradventure you dwell among&s;t us; and how &s;hall we make a League with you?</HI> Which Words &s;hew, that they remembered the Com|mand
<PB N="14" REF="009314_0012_103032BAA0EF03D8">
before mentioned; and yet did not enquire at the Mouth of the LORD, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> directed <HI>Jo|&s;hua,</HI> when he gave him a Charge re&s;pecting his Duty as chief Man among that People, <HI>Numb.</HI> xxvii. 21. By this Omi&s;&s;ion Things became &s;o &s;ituated, that <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the Princes could not execute the Judgments of GOD on them, without violating the Oath which they had made.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did ami&s;s at the Waters of <HI>Meribah;</HI> and doubtle&s;s he &s;oon repented; for the LORD was with him. And it is likely that <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was deeply humbled, under a Sen&s;e of his Omi&s;&s;ion; for it appears that GOD continued him in his Of|fice, and &s;pared the Lives of tho&s;e People, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ake of the League and Oath made in his Name.</P>
<P>THE Wickedne&s;s of the&s;e People was great, and they worthy to die, or perfect Ju&s;tice had not pa&s;&s;ed Sentence of Death upon them; and as their Execution was prevented by this League and Oath, they appear content to be Servants: <HI>As it &s;eemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Criminals, in&s;tead of Death, had the Sentence of Servitude pronounced on them, in the&s;e Words, <HI>Now therefore ye are cur&s;ed; and there &s;hall none of you be freed from being Bond|men, and Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water for the Hou&s;e of my God.</HI></P>
<P>WE find, <HI>Deut.</HI> xx. 10. that there were Cities far di&s;tant from <HI>Canaan,</HI> again&s;t which <HI>I&s;rael</HI> went to Battle; unto whom they were to proclaim Peace, and if the Inhabitants made An&s;wer of Peace, and opened their Gates, they were not to de&s;troy them, but make them Tributaries.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="009314_0013_103032BCA5BBB6B8">
THE Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were then the LORD's Ho&s;t, and Executioners of his Judgments on Peo|ple hardened in Wickedne&s;s.&mdash;They were not to go to Battle, but by his Appointment. The Men who were chief in his Army, had their In&s;truc|tions from the Almighty; &s;ometimes immediate|ly, and &s;ometimes by the Mini&s;try of Angels&punc; Of the&s;e, among&s;t others, were <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Othniel,</HI> and <HI>Gideon;</HI> See <HI>Exod.</HI> iii. 2. and xviii. 19. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> v. 13. The&s;e People far off from <HI>Canaan,</HI> again&s;t whom <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was &s;ent to Battle, were &s;o corrupt, that the Creator of the Univer&s;e &s;aw it good to change their Situation; and in ca&s;e of their open|ing their Gates, and coming under Tribute, this their Subjection, though probably more mild than ab&s;olute Slavery, was to la&s;t little or no longer than while <HI>I&s;rael</HI> remained in the true Spirit of Government.</P>
<P>IT was pronounced by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the Prophet, as a Con&s;equence of their Wickedne&s;s, <HI>The Stranger that is within thee &s;hall get above thee very high&punc; and thou &s;halt come down very low: He &s;hall be the Head, and thou the Tail.</HI></P>
<P>THIS we find in &s;ome Mea&s;ure verified in their being made Tributaries to the <HI>Moabites, Midian|ites, Amorites</HI> and <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI></P>
<P>IT is alledged in Favour of the Practice of Slave-keeping, that the <HI>Jews</HI> by their Law made Slaves of the Heathen, <HI>Levit.</HI> xxv. 45. <HI>More|over, of the Children of the Stranger that do &s;ojourn among&s;t you, of them &s;hall ye buy, and of their Children, which are with you, which they beget in your Land; and they &s;hall be your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and
<PB N="16" REF="009314_0014_1030DEF413C8E548">
you &s;hall take them as an Inheritance for your Chil|dren after you, to inherit them as a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they &s;hall be your Bondmen for ever.</HI>&mdash;It is difficult for us to have any certain Knowledge of the Mind of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in Regard to keeping Slaves, any other Way than by looking upon him as a true Servant of GOD, who&s;e Mind and Conduct were regu|lated by an inward Principle of Ju&s;tice and Equi|ty. To admit a Suppo&s;ition that he in that Ca&s;e was drawn from perfect Equity by the Alliance of outward Kindred, would be to di&s;own his Au|thority.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham</HI> had Servants born in his Hou&s;e, and bought with his Money: <HI>And the Almighty &s;aid of Abraham, I know him, that he will order his Hou&s;e after him.</HI> Which implies, that he was as a Father, an In&s;tructor, and a good Governor over his People.&mdash;And <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> con&s;idered as a Man of GOD, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have had a Pro&s;|pect of &s;ome real Advantage in the Strangers and Heathens being Servants to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> for a Time.</P>
<P>As Mankind had received and e&s;tabli&s;hed ma|ny erroneous Opinions and hurtful Cu&s;toms, their living and conver&s;ing with the <HI>Jews,</HI> while the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;tood faithful to their Principles, might be helpful to remove tho&s;e Errors, and reform their Manners.&mdash;But for Men, with private Views, to a&s;&s;ume an ab&s;olute Power over the Per&s;ons and Properties of others; and continue it from Age to Age in the Line of natural Genera|tion, without Regard to the Virtues and Vices of their Succe&s;&s;ors, as it is manife&s;tly contrary to true

<P>HE directed them to buy Strangers and So|journers.&mdash;It appears that there were Strangers in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> who were free Men; and con&s;idering with what Tenderne&s;s and Humanity the <HI>Jews,</HI> by their Law, were obliged to u&s;e their Servants, and what Care was to be taken to in&s;truct them in the true Religion, it is not unlikely that &s;ome Strangers in Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s were willing to enter into Bonds to &s;erve the <HI>Jews</HI> as long as they lived; and in &s;uch Ca&s;e the <HI>Jews,</HI> by their Law, had a Right to their Service during Life.</P>
<P>WHEN the Awl was bored through the Ear of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Servant, the Text faith, <HI>He &s;hall &s;erve for ever;</HI> yet we do not &s;uppo&s;e that by the Word <HI>for ever,</HI> it was intended that none of his Po&s;teri|ty &s;hould afterwards be free; when it is &s;aid in Regard to the Strangers which they bought, <HI>They &s;hall be your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> it may be well under&s;tood to mean only the Per&s;ons &s;o purcha&s;ed; all pre|ceding relates to buying them; and what follows, to the Continuance of their Service. <HI>You &s;hall take them as an Inheritance to your Children after you; they &s;hall be your Bondmen for ever.</HI> It may be well under&s;tood to &s;tand limited to tho&s;e they purcha&s;ed.</P>

The <HI>Jews</HI> undoubtedly had Slaves, whom they kept as &s;uch from one Age to ano|ther; but that this was agreeable to the genuine De&s;ign of their in&s;pired Law-giver, is far from being a clear Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>MAKING Con&s;tructions of the Law contrary to the true Meaning of it, was common among&s;t that People.&mdash;<HI>Samuel'</HI>s Sons took Bribes, and perverted Judgment.&mdash;<HI>I&s;aiah</HI> complained that they ju&s;tified the Wicked for Reward.&mdash;<HI>Ze|phaniah,</HI> Cotemporary with <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> on Account of the Inju&s;tice of the civil Magi&s;trates, declared that tho&s;e Judges were Evening Wolves; and that the Prie&s;ts did Violence to the Law.</P>
<P><HI>Jeremiah</HI> acquaints us, that the Prie&s;ts cried Peace, Peace, when there was no Peace; by which Means the People grew bold in their Wickedne&s;s; and having committed Abomina|tions, were not a&s;hamed; but, through wrong Con&s;tructions of the Law, they ju&s;tified them|&s;elves, and boa&s;tingly &s;aid, <HI>We are wi&s;e; and the Law of the Lord is with us.</HI> The&s;e Corruptions continued till the Days of our Saviour, who told the <HI>Phari&s;ees, You have made the Commandment of God of none Effect through your Tradition.</HI></P>

THUS it appears that they corrupted the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> nor is it unlikely that among many others this was one; for oppre&s;&s;ing the Strangers was a heavy Charge again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> and very often &s;trongly repre&s;ented by the Lord's faithful Prophets.</P>
<P>THAT the Liberty of Man was, by the in|&s;pired Law-giver, e&s;teemed precious, appears in this; that &s;uch who unju&s;tly deprived Men of it, were to be puni&s;hed in like Manner as if they had murdered them. <HI>He that &s;tealeth a Man, and &s;elleth him; or if he be found in his Hand, &s;hall &s;urely be put to Death.</HI> This Part of the Law was &s;o con&s;iderable, that <HI>Paul,</HI> the learned <HI>Jew,</HI> giving a brief Account of the U&s;es of the Law, adds this, <HI>It was made for Men-&s;tealers,</HI> I Tim. i. 10.</P>
<P>THE great Men among&s;t that People were ex|ceeding oppre&s;&s;ive; and, it is likely, exerted their whole Strength and Influence to have the Law con&s;trued to &s;uit their Turns.&mdash;The ho|ne&s;t Servants of the Lord had heavy Work with them in regard to their Oppre&s;&s;ion; a few In|&s;tances follow. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of I&s;rael, amend your Ways, and your Doings; and I will cau&s;e you to dwell in this Place.

To lean on the Example of Men in doubtful Ca&s;es, is difficult: For only admit, that tho&s;e Men were not faithful and upright to the highe&s;t Degree, but that in &s;ome particular Ca&s;e they erred, and it may follow that this one Ca&s;e was the &s;ame, about which we are in Doubt; and to quiet our Minds by their Example, may be dan|gerous to our&s;elves; and continuing in it, prove a Stumbling-block to tender-minded People who &s;ucceed us, in like Manner as their Examples are to us.</P>

<P>SINCE Mankind &s;pread upon the Earth, many have been the Revolutions attending the &s;everal Families, and their Cu&s;toms and Ways of Life different from each other.

to do Violence to innocent Men; to bring them from their own to another Way of Life. The Mind, when moved by a Principle of true Love, may feel a Warmth of Gratitude to the univer&s;al Father, and a lively Sympathy with tho&s;e Nations, where Divine Light has been le&s;s manife&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS De&s;ire for their real Good may beget a Willingne&s;s to undergo Hard&s;hips for their Sakes, that the true Knowledge of GOD may be &s;pread among&s;t them: But to take them from their own Land, with Views of Profit to our&s;elves, by Means incon&s;i&s;tent with pure Ju&s;tice, is foreign to that Principle which &s;eeks the Happine&s;s of the whole Creation. Forced Subjection, on innocent Per&s;ons of full Age, is incon&s;i&s;tent with right Rea&s;on; on one Side, the human Mind is not naturally forti|fied with that Firmne&s;s in Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, nece&s;&s;ary to an independent Ruler; on the other Side, to be &s;ubject to the uncontroulable Will of a Man, liable to err, is mo&s;t painful and afflicting to a con&s;cientious Creature.</P>
<P>IT is our Happine&s;s faithfully to &s;erve the Di|vine Being, who made us: His Perfection makes our Service rea&s;onable; but &s;o long as Men are bluffed by narrow Self-love, &s;o long an ab&s;olute Power over other Men is unfit for them.</P>
<P>MEN, taking on them the Government of others, may intend to govern rea&s;onably, and make their Subjects more happy than they would be otherwi&s;e; but, as ab&s;olute Command belongs only to him who is perfect, where frail Men, in their own Wills, a&s;&s;ume &s;uch Command, it hath

a direct Tendency to vitiate their Minds, and make them more unfit for Government.</P>
<P>PLACING on Men the ignominious Title SLAVE, dre&s;&s;ing them in uncomely Garments, keeping them to &s;ervile Labour, in which they are often dirty, tends gradually to fix a Notion in the Mind, that they are a Sort of People below us in Nature, and leads us to con&s;ider them as &s;uch in all our Conclu&s;ions about them. And, moreover, a Per&s;on which in our E&s;teem is mean and con|temptible, if their Language or Behaviour to|ward us is un&s;eemly or di&s;re&s;pectful, it excites Wrath more powerfully than the like Conduct in one we accounted our Equal or Superior; and where this happens to be the Ca&s;e, it di&s;qualifies for candid Judgment; for it is unfit for a Per&s;on to &s;it as Judge in a Ca&s;e where his own per&s;onal Re&s;entments are &s;tirred up; and, as Members of Society in a well framed Government, we are mutually dependant. Pre&s;ent Intere&s;t incites to Duty, and makes each Man attentive to the Con|venience of others; but he who&s;e Will is a Law to others, and can enforce Obedience by Puni&s;h|ment; he who&s;e Wants are &s;upplied without feel|ing any Obligation to make equal Returns to his Benefactor, his irregular Appetites find an open Field for Motion, and he is in Danger of grow|ing hard, and inattentive to their Convenience who labour for his Support; and &s;o lo&s;es that Di&s;po&s;ition, in which alone Men are fit to govern.</P>

<P><HI>BOSMAN</HI> on <HI>Guiney,</HI> who was a Factor for the <HI>Dutch</HI> about &s;ixteen Years in that Coun|try (Page 339) thus remarks: <Q>But &s;ince I have &s;o often mentioned that Commerce, I &s;hall de|&s;cribe how it is managed by our Factors. The fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s of one of our Factors, when he comes to <HI>Fida,</HI> is to &s;atisfy the Cu&s;toms of the King, and the great Men, which amounts to about <HI>One Hundred Pounds,</HI> in <HI>Guiney</HI> Value, as the Goods mu&s;t &s;ell there. After which we have free Licence to trade, which is publi&s;hed throughout the whole Land by the Cryer. And yet before we can deal with any Per&s;on, we are obliged to buy the King's whole Stock of Slaves, at a &s;et Price; which is commonly one Third or Fourth higher than ordinary. After which, we have free Leave to deal with all his Subjects, of what Rank &s;oever. But if there happen to be no Stock of Slaves, the Factor mu&s;t re&s;olve to run the Ri&s;k of tru&s;ting the In|habitants with Goods, to the Value of One or Two Hundred Slaves; which Commodities they &s;end into the Inland Country, in order to buy with them Slaves at all Markets, and that &s;ometimes Two Hundred Miles deep in the Country: For you ought to be informed, that Markets of Men are here kept in the &s;ame Manner as they of Bea&s;ts are with us.</Q></P>

<P>MOST of the Slaves which are offered to us, are Pri&s;oners of War, which are &s;old by the Victors as their Booty.&mdash;When the&s;e Slaves come to <HI>Fida,</HI> they are put in Pri&s;ons all toge|ther; and when we treat concerning them, they are all brought out in a large Plain, where, by our Surgeons, who&s;e Province it is, they are thoroughly examined, even to the &s;malle&s;t Member, and that naked, both Men and Wo|men, without the lea&s;t Di&s;tinction or Mode&s;ty.

This is done, that we may di&s;tingui&s;h them from the Slaves of the <HI>Engli&s;h, French,</HI> or others.

<P>THE Author of this Treati&s;e, conver&s;ing with a Per&s;on of good Credit, was informed by him, that in his Youth, while in <HI>England,</HI> he was minded to come to <HI>America,</HI> and happening on a Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Guiney,</HI> and from thence into <HI>America,</HI> he, with a View to &s;ee <HI>Africa,</HI> went on board her, and continued with them in their Voyage, and &s;o came into this Country.

<Q><P>Another Slave was charged with having a De&s;ign to kill the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and the Captain &s;poke to him in Relation to the Charge brought again&s;t him, as he &s;tood on Deck; whereupon he immediately threw him&s;elf into the Sea, and was drowned.</P>
<P>SEVERAL <HI>Negroes,</HI> confined on board, were, he &s;aid, &s;o extremely unea&s;y with their Con|dition, that after many Endeavours u&s;ed, they could never make them eat nor drink after

<P><PB N="46" REF="009314_0044_1030DF63F1396120">
WHATEVER Nicety of Di&s;tinction there may be, betwixt going in Per&s;on on Expeditions to catch Slaves, and buying tho&s;e, with a View to Self-intere&s;t, which others have taken; it is clear and plain to an upright Mind, that &s;uch Di&s;tinc|tion is in Words, not in Sub&s;tance; for the Par|ties are concerned in the &s;ame Work, and have a nece&s;&s;ary Connection with, and Dependance on, each other; for were there none to purcha&s;e Slaves, they who live by &s;tealing and &s;elling them, would of Con&s;equence do le&s;s at it.</P>
<P>SOME would buy a <HI>Negroe</HI> brought from <HI>Gui|ney,</HI> with a View to Self-intere&s;t, and keep him a Slave, who yet would &s;eem to &s;cruple to take Arms, and join with Men employed in taking Slaves.</P>
<P>OTHERS have civil <HI>Negroes,</HI> who were born in our Country, capable and likely to manage well for them&s;elves; whom they keep as Slaves, without ever trying them with Freedom, and take the Profit of their Labour as a Part of their E&s;tates, and yet di&s;approve bringing them from their own Country.</P>
<P>IF tho&s;e <HI>Negroes</HI> had come here, as Merchants, with their Ivory and Gold Du&s;t, in order to trade with us, and &s;ome powerful Per&s;on had took their Effects to him&s;elf, and then put them to hard Labour, and ever after con&s;idered them as Slaves, the Action would be looked upon as unrighteous.</P>
<P>THOSE <HI>Negroe</HI> Merchants having Children after their being among us, who&s;e Endowments and Conduct were like other Peoples in common, who attaining to mature Age, and reque&s;ting to
<PB N="47" REF="009314_0045_1030DF6AF07E98B8">
have their Liberty, &s;hould be told they were born in Slavery, and were lawful Slaves, and there|fore their Reque&s;t denied; the Conduct of &s;uch Per&s;ons toward them, would be looked upon as unfair and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, relating to Home-born <HI>Negroes,</HI> who&s;e Under&s;tandings and Behaviour are as good as common among other People, if we have any Claim to them as Slaves, that Claim is grounded on their being the Children or Off|&s;pring of Slaves, who, in general, were made &s;uch through Means as unrighteous, and attended with more terrible Circum&s;tances than the Ca&s;e here &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;o that when we trace our Claim to the Bott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, the&s;e Home-born <HI>Negroes</HI> having paid for their Education, and given rea&s;onable Security to tho&s;e who owned them, in ca&s;e of their becoming chargeable, we have no more equitable Right to their Service, than we &s;hould if they were the Children of hone&s;t Merchants who came from <HI>Guiney</HI> in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el to trade with us.</P>
<P>IF we claim any Right to them as the Chil|dren of Slaves, we build on the Foundation laid by them, who made Slaves of their Ance&s;tors; &s;o that of Nece&s;&s;ity we mu&s;t either ju&s;tify the Trade, or relinqui&s;h our Right to them, as being the Children of Slaves.</P>
<P>WHY &s;hould it &s;eem right to hone&s;t Men to make Advantage by the&s;e People more than by others? Others enjoy Freedom, receive Wages, equal to their Work, at, or near, &s;uch Time as they have di&s;charged the&s;e equitable Obligations
<PB N="48" REF="009314_0046_1030DF6C89205590">
they are under to tho&s;e who educated them.&mdash;The&s;e have made no Contract to &s;erve; been no more expen&s;ive in rai&s;ing up than others, and many of them appear as likely to make a right U&s;e of Freedom as other People; which Way then can an hone&s;t Man withhold from them that Li|berty, which is the free Gift of the Mo&s;t High to his rational Creatures?</P>
<P>THE Upright in Heart cannot &s;ucceed the Wicked in their Wickedne&s;s; nor is it con&s;onant to the Life they live, to hold fa&s;t an Advantage unju&s;tly gained.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Negroes</HI> who live by Plunder, and the Slave-Trade, &s;teal poor innocent Children, invade their Neighbours Territories, and &s;pill much Blood to get the&s;e Slaves: And can it be po&s;&s;ible for an hone&s;t Man to think that, with View to Self-intere&s;t, we may continue Slavery to the Offspring of the&s;e unhappy Sufferers&punc; merely becau&s;e they are the Children of Slaves, and not have a Share of this Guilt.</P>
<P>IT is granted by many, that the Means u&s;ed in getting them are unrighteous, and that buying them, when brought here, is wrong; yet as &s;et|ting them free is attended with &s;ome Difficulty, they do not comply with it; but &s;eem to be of the Opinion, that to give them Food and Rai|ment, and keep them Servants, without any other Wages, is the be&s;t Way to manage them that they know of: And hoping that their Children after them will not be cruel to the <HI>Negroes,</HI> conclude to leave them as Slaves to their Children.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="009314_0047_1030DF733AE122A8">
WHILE pre&s;ent outward Intere&s;t is the chief Object of our Attention, we &s;hall feel many Ob|jections in our Minds again&s;t renouncing our Claim to them, as the Children of Slaves; for being pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with wrong Opinions, prevents our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing Things clearly, which, to indifferent Per&s;ons, are ea&s;y to be &s;een.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a Per&s;on Seventy Years pa&s;t, in low Circum&s;tances, bought a <HI>Negroe</HI> Man and Wo|man, and that the Children of &s;uch Per&s;on are now wealthy, and have the Children of &s;uch Slaves. Admit that the fir&s;t <HI>Negroe</HI> Man and his Wife did as much Bu&s;ine&s;s as their Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that the Children of the Slaves have done &s;ome more than their young Ma&s;ters: Sup|po&s;e, on the whole, that the Expence of Living has been le&s;s on the <HI>Negroes</HI> Side, than on the other (all which are no improbable Suppo&s;itions) it follows, that in Equity the&s;e <HI>Negroes</HI> have a Right to a Part of this Increa&s;e; that &s;hould &s;ome Difficulties ari&s;e on their being &s;et free, there is Rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> us patiently to labour through them.</P>
<P>As the Conduct of Men varies, relating to Ci|vil Society; &s;o different Treatment is ju&s;tly due to them. Indi&s;creet Men occa&s;ion Trouble in the World; and it remains to be the Care of &s;uch, who &s;eek the Good of Mankind, to admoni&s;h as they find Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Slothfulne&s;s of &s;ome of them, in providing for them&s;elves and Families, it is likely, would require the Notice of their Neighbours; nor is it unlikely that &s;ome would, with Ju&s;tice, be made Servants, and others puni&s;hed for their Crimes.
<PB N="50" REF="009314_0048_1030DF74D4C2D1C0">
Pure Ju&s;tice points out to each Individual their Due; but to deny a People the Privilege of hu|man Creatures, on a Suppo&s;ition that, being free, many of them would be trouble&s;ome to us, is to mix the Condition of good and bad Men together, and treat the whole as the wor&s;t of them de&s;erve.</P>
<P>IF we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, that Liberty is the Right of innocent Men; that the Mighty GOD is a Refuge for the Oppre&s;&s;ed; that in Reality we are indebted to them; that they being &s;et free, are &s;till liable to the Penalties of our Laws, and as likely to have Puni&s;hment for their Crimes as other People: This may an&s;wer all our Objec|tions. And to retain them in perpetual Servitude, without ju&s;t Cau&s;e for it, will produce Effects, in the Event, more grievous than &s;etting them free would do, when a real Love to Truth and Equi|ty was the Motive to it.</P>
<P>OUR Authority over them &s;tands originally in a Purcha&s;e made from tho&s;e who, as to the ge|neral, obtained theirs by Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. When|ever we have Recour&s;e to &s;uch Authority, it tends more or le&s;s to ob&s;truct the Channels, through which the perfect Plant in us receives Nouri&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>THERE is a Principle, which is pure, placed in the human Mind, which in different Places and Ages hath had different Names; it is, how|ever, pure, and proceeds from GOD.&mdash;It is deep, and inward, confined to no Forms of Religion, nor excluded from any, where the Heart &s;tands in perfect Sincerity. In whom&s;oever this takes Root, and grows, of what Nation &s;oever, they
<PB N="51" REF="009314_0049_1030DF767256C3B8">
become Brethren, in the be&s;t Sen&s;e of the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion. U&s;ing our&s;elves to take Ways which appear mo&s;t ea&s;y to us, when incon&s;i&s;tent with that Purity which is without Beginning, we there|by &s;et up a Government of our own, and deny Obedience to him, who&s;e Service is true Liberty.</P>
<P>HE that has a Servant, made &s;o wrongfully, and knows it to be &s;o, when he treats him other|wi&s;e than a free Man, when he reaps the Benefit of his Labour, without paying him &s;uch Wages as are rea&s;onably due to free Men for the like Ser|vice, Cloaths excepted; the&s;e Things, tho' done in Calmne&s;s, without any Shew of Di&s;order, do yet deprave the Mind in like Manner, and with as great Certainty, as prevailing Cold congeals Wa|ter. The&s;e Steps taken by Ma&s;ters, and their Con|duct &s;triking the Minds of their Children, whil&s;t young, leave le&s;s Room for that which is good to work upon them. The Cu&s;toms of their Parents, their Neighbours, and the People with whom they conver&s;e, working upon their Minds; and they, from thence, conceiving Ideas of Things, and Modes of Conduct, the Entrance into their Hearts becomes, in a great Mea&s;ure, &s;hut up again&s;t the gentle Movings of uncreated Purity.</P>
<P>FROM one Age to another, the Gloom grows thicker and darker, till Error gets e&s;tabli&s;hed by general Opinion; that whoever attends to perfect Goodne&s;s, and remains under the melting Influ|ence of it, finds a Path unknown to many, and &s;ees the Nece&s;&s;ity to lean upon the Arm of Divine Strength, and dwell alone, or with a few, in the right committing their Cau&s;e to him, who
<PB N="52" REF="009314_0050_1030DF78088D1640">
is a Refuge for his People, in all their Troubles.</P>
<P>WHERE, through the Agreement of a Multi|tude, &s;ome Channels of Ju&s;tice are &s;topped, and Men may &s;upport their Characters as ju&s;t Men, by being ju&s;t to a Party, there is great Danger of con|tracting an Alliance with that Spirit, which &s;tands in Oppo&s;ition to the GOD of Love, and &s;preads Di&s;cord, Trouble and Vexation among &s;uch who give up to the Influence of it.</P>
<P><HI>Negroes</HI> are our Fellow Creatures, and their pre&s;ent Condition among&s;t us requires our &s;erious Con&s;ideration. We know not the Time when tho&s;e Scales, in which Mountains are weighed, may turn. The Parent of Mankind is gracious: His Care is over his &s;malle&s;t Creatures; and a Multitude of Men e&s;cape not his Notice: And though many of them are trodden down, and de|&s;pi&s;ed, yet he remembers them: He &s;eeth their Affliction, and looketh upon the &s;preading increa|&s;ing Exaltation of the Oppre&s;&s;or. He turns the Channels of Power, humbles the mo&s;t haughty People, and gives Deliverance to the Oppre&s;&s;ed, at &s;uch Periods as are con&s;i&s;tent with his infinite Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s. And wherever Gain is pre|ferred to Equity, and wrong Things publickly encouraged to that Degree, that Wickedne&s;s takes Root, and &s;preads wide among&s;t the Inhabitants of a Country, there is real Cau&s;e for Sorrow to all &s;uch, who&s;e Love to Mankind &s;tands on a true Principle, and wi&s;ely con&s;ider the End and Event of Things.</P>
