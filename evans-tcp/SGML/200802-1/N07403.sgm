<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE are &s;ome men who write, and others who read controver&s;y, merely from a wrangling di&s;po&s;i|tion; without any regard to truth, right, or the importance of the matters conte&s;ted. That this is a turn of mind unbecoming a Chri&s;tian, and even a man, needs not be &s;aid. Others have an utter di&s;like to all di&s;putes relative to the &s;ub|ject of religion, becau&s;e they are Sceptics; thinking there is nothing of this kind worth di&s;puting about. Only thus far they are ful|ly per&s;uaded, that it is a pity the world &s;hould be di&s;turbed by &s;uch trifling debates, in the peaceable pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, or of &s;olid gain; very gravely condemning all di&s;putants as quarrel&s;ome people that would &s;et the world in a flame, and making no &s;mall merit of their own indifference to all religion in general. A third &s;ort are tho&s;e good men, who &s;incere|ly love and practi&s;e religion them&s;elves; but yet are &s;uch great lovers of peace, of &s;uch a timid make, and &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the bad
<PB N="6" REF="009441_0004_0F748D760FEC2818">effects of contention, that they think it be&s;t never to enter into debates on religion, or any thing relative to it, on any occa&s;ion; and con|demn tho&s;e who do &s;o, as at be&s;t imprudent, ill-advi&s;ed per&s;ons.</P>
<P>BUT &s;urely, there may be ju&s;t and &s;uffici|ent cau&s;e for di&s;puting, if religion it&s;elf is of any great importance. We are enjoined to contend earne&s;tly for the faith: Nor are even the means, modes and circum&s;tantials of reli|gion, wholly unworthy in all ca&s;es to be the &s;ubject of controver&s;y. The epi&s;tles of the apo&s;tle PAUL, who would not have the Gen|tiles troubled about circumci&s;ion, or other Jewi&s;h rites; and exhorted them to &s;tand fa&s;t in their LIBERTY, in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to any yoke of BONDAGE, &s;ufficiently evince this. And if the good, peaceable gentlemen who were mentioned above, are left to exer|ci&s;e their own liberty and di&s;cretion, either to read or not read di&s;putes; one would think, they &s;hould allow others the like liberty and di&s;cretion as to writing: No one will compel them to read, contrary to their inclination&mdash;</P>
<P>THE author of the following pages &s;uppo|&s;es the &s;ubject of them to be of real importance, not only to the general intere&s;t of religion in AMERICA, but particularly in NEW-ENG|LAND. In which re&s;pect he is very far from being &s;ingular in his opinion. Indeed, none be&s;ides tho&s;e who think that our Forefathers &s;eparated from the Church of ENGLAND
<PB N="7" REF="009441_0005_0F748D76DA2F6650">without ju&s;t grounds; and that the differen|ces &s;ub&s;i&s;ting betwixt the people of that com|munion and ours, are quite immaterial, can &s;uppo&s;e this a needle&s;s controver&s;y. The pro&s;perity, if not the very being of our NEW-ENGLAND Churches, is e&s;&s;entially concerned in it; as may appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>AN evident occa&s;ion was lately given for &s;ome per&s;on or other among&s;t us to write upon it, by a Gentleman on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, who has attempted, as he tho't proper to expre&s;s him&s;elf, "to determine it <HI>once for all,</HI> by authentic vouchers." The author of the en&s;uing pages pretends to no &s;uch great matters; and would have been &s;incerely glad, if &s;ome per&s;on of greater abi|lities and more lei&s;ure, would have &s;aved him this trouble. But &s;ome of his friends, perhaps partial in his favor, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that he would take &s;o fair an opportunity to commu|nicate &s;ome of his thoughts to the public, on the point in que&s;tion. In a word, his aver&s;ion to controver&s;y has, on this occa&s;ion, given way to his regard to truth and ju&s;tice, back'd in this manner.</P>
<P>THO' he really believes the con&s;titution, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline of the Church of ENG|LAND much le&s;s agreeable to the word of GOD than our own; yet he has an high ve|neration for many per&s;ons of that communion, as per&s;ons of great learning and wi&s;dom, can|dor and piety. He therefore reque&s;ts that
<PB N="8" REF="009441_0006_0F748D76F74598E0">nothing which here follows, may be con&s;ide|red as a general reflection upon the people of that per&s;ua&s;ion. He is al&s;o &s;en&s;ible that the SOCIETY, &amp;c. area very re&s;pectable BODY, and to be treated with all the regard that is con&s;i&s;tent with truth and ju&s;tice. But he can|not think, an implicit faith is to be placed in any BODY of unin&s;pired men, however great or good; or that there is any indecency in examining into &s;ome of the Conduct of the &s;aid SOCIETY, and comparing it with their CHARTER; that &s;o, if there is any real in|con&s;i&s;tency betwixt them, it may appear. This he takes to be the undoubted right of every BRITISH &s;ubject, as well as his own. But tho' he propo&s;es to lay &s;ome of his &s;enti|ments on this &s;ubject before the world, in &s;implicity and with freedom; yet he declares, it is by no means his intention to charge that venerable BODY with any <HI>wilful, known</HI> mi&s;|conduct, or improper application of monies: And therefore he reque&s;ts the candor of his readers, that no advantage may be taken of any incautious expre&s;&s;ion that may e&s;cape him in the pur&s;uit of his argument, even tho' it &s;hould at fir&s;t view have the appearance of &s;uch an accu&s;ation; for it is not de&s;igned as &s;uch.</P>
<P>IF his ob&s;ervations are futile in them&s;elves, or if there is any indecency in the manner of his propo&s;ing them, as he hopes there is not, the di&s;honor will be to him&s;elf: And he even
<PB N="9" REF="009441_0007_0F748D77B6973070">wi&s;hes others to judge with the fame freedom and impartiality that he intends to write.</P>
<P>THE reverend Mr. NOAH HOBART of <HI>Fair|field,</HI> in a book entitled <HI>A &s;econd addre&s;s to the members of the</HI> EPISCOPAL SEPARATION IN NEW-ENGLAND, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Publi&s;hed 1751.</NOTE> entered into this argument concerning the SOCIETY's conduct; which he handled in a manner becoming both a truly <HI>Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop</HI> and a <HI>Patriot</HI>; and de&s;erves the thanks of his country, as well as the high e&s;teem of his flock. His book has been of &s;er|vice to me; and wherever I make u&s;e of it in the following &s;heets, proper acknowledgments are made. In &s;hort, Mr. HOBART wrote &s;o &s;olidly and judiciou&s;ly upon this &s;ubject, that it would hardly have been needful to &s;ay any thing farther upon it at this time, except in conformity to that maxim, That every thing <HI>newly publi&s;hed</HI> on a controverted point, mu&s;t be <HI>an&s;wered</HI>;&mdash;unle&s;s it is either convincing and &s;atisfactory to the <HI>knowing,</HI> or &s;o mean and trifling, that even the <HI>ignorant</HI> are in no danger of being impo&s;ed upon thereby. Probably there are not many, who know any thing of the matter, that think the <HI>former</HI> the true cha|racter of Mr. APTHORP's <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> &amp;c. And if I &s;uppo&s;ed they de&s;erved the <HI>latter,</HI> I &s;hould think my time ill employed in endea|vouring to prevent their having <HI>that effect.</HI> They &s;eem to me to hold &s;uch a <HI>medium</HI> be|twixt evidence to the wi&s;e, and glaring ab&s;ur|dity
<PB N="10" REF="009441_0008_0F748D78779E4BE8">to the fooli&s;h, as to render &s;ome &s;trictures upon them very expedient.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman's di&s;cretion is, at lea&s;t in <HI>one</HI> re&s;pect, very con&s;picuous; perhaps in ma|ny. Having taken the defence of the SOCI|ETY upon him&s;elf in quality of an <HI>advocate,</HI> the validity of his plea is then humbly &s;ub|mitted to his venerable CLIENTS in quality of JUDGES. His <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI> are in&s;cribed to the SOCIETY, "in appeal to their JUDGMENT and DECISION." And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;o ingenious an <HI>advocate</HI> as Mr. APTHORP will lo&s;e a cau&s;e, wherein he is &s;o happy as to have the &s;ame honorable and venerable per&s;onages both for CLIENTS and JUDGES?&mdash;e&s;pecially if he has them for his WITNESSES too; as will appear in due time and place to be his pe|culiar felicity. I &s;hould, however, have fol|lowed him to the SAME TRIBUNAL to which he has appealed, had I not feared it might be thought a piece of rudene&s;s, or kind of in&s;ult, to in&s;cribe to &s;o venerable a BODY tho&s;e <HI>Ob|&s;ervations,</HI> the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of which is, to &s;hew that they have, in &s;ome re&s;pects, coun|ter-acted and defeated the truly noble ends of their INSTITUTION, however contrary to their intention.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.
The <HI>QUESTION</HI> &s;tated.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the following pages de|&s;ires to have what he di&s;putes about, relative to the <HI>charter,</HI> SOCIETY and their <HI>mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> clearly under&s;tood in the fir&s;t place. He apprehends there is no ground for controver&s;y as to religious liberty, or the na|tural and legal right which prote&s;tants of all denominations have, in any part of his Maje&s;|ty's dominions, to wor&s;hip God in their own way re&s;pectively, without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>NOR is the que&s;tion, whether any per&s;on or per&s;ons in Great-Britain have a right, con&s;i|dered in their private capacity, if they think it expedient, to encourage and propagate epi&s;|copacy in America, by tran&s;mitting money to build churches here, to &s;upport mi&s;&s;ions and &s;chools, or the like. Whatever our &s;entiments may be about the church of England, we are not &s;o vain as to a&s;&s;ume a right of dictating to them the manner in which they &s;hall, or &s;hall not be&s;tow their charity; or in any &s;ort to
<PB N="12" REF="009441_0010_0F748D79F8006918">controul them herein. This is &s;aid with re|ference to people in England, con&s;idered in their private capacity, as was intimated before.</P>
<P>AGAIN: The que&s;tion is not, whether that very re&s;pectable Body corporate, <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the go&s;pel in foreign parts,</HI> are to judge for them&s;elves in what particular pla|ces, and under what circum&s;tances their cha|rity is to be employed, conformable to the true de&s;ign of their charter. They mu&s;t, in the nature of the thing, judge for them&s;elves in this re&s;pect, if they act with integrity, accor|ding to the nature of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; which is not di&s;puted. Though as this is a matter of public concernment, in which the civil as well as religious intere&s;t of the King's &s;ubjects in America is nearly concerned; other people have a right to give their opinion about the manner in which that charitable fund is employed; whether agreeably to the intent of the charter or not; and even publicly to re|mon&s;trate again&s;t any mi&s;applications of it, whether through mi&s;-information, or any other &s;uppo&s;eable means, in order to a reformation of &s;uch abu&s;es, if real. Moreover;</P>
<P>THERE is no di&s;pute, but that the venerable Society have a right to plant churches, to &s;up|port mi&s;&s;ions and &s;chools, &amp;c. in many of the Briti&s;h American colonies; or whether this is in conformity to the intent of their charter. No one that has ever read it, can po&s;&s;ibly make a doubt of this; or imagine that the Society's
<PB N="13" REF="009441_0011_0F748D7B5F9816C8">care and charity ought to be confined to the heathen &s;laves in, or the &s;avages bordering on the plantations.</P>
<P>BUT then it is &s;uppo&s;ed by many per&s;ons, that there are &s;ome of the&s;e American colonies, who&s;e religious &s;tate is &s;uch, as renders them improper objects of this charity; and con&s;e|quently, that whatever has been done by the Society in &s;upporting epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ions in them, is a mi&s;application of that part of their fund, which has been employed in this way; to the neglect, prejudice and injury of other colonies, the Negroes and Indians, who were unque&s;tionably proper objects of their cha|rity.</P>
<P>THIS therefore, is the main que&s;tion now propo&s;ed for a free and candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; Whether the planting epi&s;copal churches, &s;up|porting mi&s;&s;ions and &s;chools, &amp;c. in certain parts of America, particularly in New-England, in the manner, and under the circum&s;tances in which this has been, and &s;till is done by the Society, is conformable to the true de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, according to their charter; or a deviation therefrom, and con&s;equently a mi&s;application of their fund?</P>
<P>THIS is a que&s;tion of no &s;mall importance: And it can be determined only by comparing the manner and circum&s;tances in which the Society have planted churches, &s;upported mi&s;|&s;ions, &amp;c. in the&s;e parts, with their charter it|&s;elf. And all who are capable of under&s;tan|ding
<PB N="14" REF="009441_0012_0F748D7BD5FBAB98">the charter, which is very plain, and who are apprized of the facts and circum&s;tances a|fore&s;aid, may be deemed competent judges of the merits of this cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT part of the charter which explains the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution, will be produced in the next &s;ection. In the mean time it may be ob&s;erved, that the ingenious Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> has propo&s;ed a certain que&s;tion for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, or rather to be "determined once for all," which was probably never thought of before; and is indeed hardly intelligible. It is this, <Q>Whether the Society&mdash;conform to the de|&s;ign of their incorporation, by maintaining epi&s;copal churches in the <HI>&s;ettled towns and villages</HI> of North-America: or whether they have not mi&s;applied a fund originally <HI>limi|mited to the conver&s;ion of the heathens.</HI></Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;iderations on the In&s;titution and Conduct of the Society,</HI> &amp;c. p. 1.</NOTE> This he &s;peaks of as a very intere&s;ting que&s;tion to "the Mi&s;&s;ionaries and their congregations." Po&s;&s;ibly it may be &s;o. But what does the gentleman mean by the <HI>&s;ettled towns and villa|ges of North-America</HI>? Is this de&s;igned in op|po&s;ition to <HI>un&s;ettled,</HI> or <HI>uninhabited</HI> towns and villages here? I know of none &s;uch: But if there were any, who ever &s;uppo&s;ed that it was expected the Society &s;hould <HI>maintain epi&s;copal churches</HI> in &s;uch, but not in the <HI>inhabited</HI> towns and villages? It were hard indeed, to confine the pious labors of the mi&s;&s;ionaries to places
<PB N="15" REF="009441_0013_0F748D7C5ECE3EE8">without inhabitants!&mdash;E&s;pecially while there are &s;o many <HI>&s;ettled</HI> towns and villages in North America, Indian as well as Engli&s;h, where they might be u&s;eful. But by the disjunction which he makes, it &s;eems as if by <HI>&s;ettled</HI> towns, &amp;c. he meant places inhabited by Engli&s;h &s;ubjects and profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians; for the Society's em|ploying their charitable fund in order to the <HI>conver&s;ion of the heathens,</HI> is the other part of the disjunction; and &s;o &s;tands in direct oppo|&s;ition to <HI>maintaining epi&s;copal churches in the &s;et|tled towns and villages here.</HI> But if this is what he means by <HI>&s;ettled</HI> towns, &amp;c. the que&s;tion &s;eems at be&s;t very vague and indeterminate: For &s;ome of the&s;e towns and villages have all along had mini&s;ters of other prote&s;tant com|munions in them; others have not. And it was proper, one would think, that the gen|tleman &s;hould have let us know which of the&s;e he intended. If he meant the latter only; and intended that the &s;ociety rightly applied their fund in maintaining epi&s;copal churches in <HI>them,</HI> as well as in the conver&s;ion of the heathen, it is allowed; there is no controver&s;y as to this. But if he meant the former al&s;o; and that the Society rightly apply their fund in maintain|ing epi&s;copal churches in places where other prote&s;tant churches were before &s;ettled, and the admini&s;tration of God's word and ordi|nances provided for, then indeed he oppo&s;es us. But, on any &s;uppo&s;ition, his disjunction is extremely lame and imperfect. And how
<PB N="16" REF="009441_0014_0F748D7CF6357100"><HI>intere&s;ting</HI> &s;oever his que&s;tion may be to the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries and their congregations</HI>; yet, as he has &s;tated it, the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> mini&s;ters and chur|ches of New-England will not probably think them&s;elves much concerned in it. For if the que&s;tion is determined only in the &s;ame loo&s;e, vague manner in which it is propo&s;ed, it can do little good nor hurt to any cau&s;e, even tho' it &s;hould be thus determined <HI>once for all.</HI></P>

<P>THE fir&s;t thing requi&s;ite in order to a right determination of the que&s;tion, Whe|ther the Society have deviated from the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution or not, is to &s;hew what that de&s;ign was.

<P N="2">2. IT appears that the Briti&s;h plantations, &amp;c. were really the primary, more immediate object of this in&s;titution: or the King's &s;ubjects. In which term, &s;ubjects, may be comprehend|ed the <HI>&s;laves</HI> in the plantations, who are the mo&s;t inferior &s;ubjects. But it al&s;o appears that the grand, ultimate de&s;ign of the in&s;titution was, the
<PB N="19" REF="009441_0017_0F748D80C3065E48"><HI>propagation of the</HI> GOSPEL <HI>in tho&s;e parts</HI>; which nece&s;&s;arily includes the de&s;ign of chri&s;tiani&s;ing the <HI>Indians</HI> bordering on the colonies, as a principal part of the general de&s;ign.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS charitable foundation was not in|tended for <HI>all</HI> the plantations, colonies and fac|tories indi&s;criminately; but for &s;uch of them only as really &s;tood in great need of relief and help in this way, and who&s;e religious &s;tate cor|re&s;ponded to the de&s;cription in the charter. This di&s;tinction betwixt the colonies, &amp;c. is clearly &s;uppo&s;ed in the charter it&s;elf, by the manner of expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed; particularly tho&s;e words, "Whereas&mdash;<HI>many</HI> of our plantations;" and&mdash; "<HI>many others</HI> of our &s;aid plantations." Had it been &s;aid, the <HI>re&s;t of them,</HI> or <HI>all others,</HI> it would have materially altered the ca&s;e. And it is at lea&s;t probable that &s;ome &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion would have been u&s;ed, had it not been taken for grant|ed, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the&s;e plantations were in a quite different &s;tate with reference to religion.</P>
<P>THIS charity mu&s;t needs have been inten|tionally <HI>limited</HI> to tho&s;e plantations, &amp;c. which were or &s;hould be, in the &s;tate repre&s;ented in the charter; in &s;uch &s;ort, that the Society had no warrant to extend it to any others, if others there were, who&s;e religious &s;tate was materially and e&s;&s;entially different.</P>
<P N="4">4. EVEN among&s;t tho&s;e plantations, &amp;c. which were truly the objects of this charity, there is &s;ome difference; for they are differently de|&s;cribed; and come under two di&s;tinct heads in the charter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="009441_0018_0F748D818C62F988"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THOSE in which the "provi&s;ion for mini&s;ters is <HI>very mean</HI>:" which are pa&s;&s;ed over with this cur&s;ory mention, as not being the plantations who&s;e relief was principally intend|ed. [And this, by the way, naturally implies that &s;ome of the plantations, &amp;c. were at that time &s;upplied with <HI>&s;uch</HI> mini&s;ters as are de&s;ign|ed in the charter, "learned and orthodox" ones: For there is no complaint again&s;t the&s;e mini&s;ters <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> but only again&s;t the mean|ne&s;s of their <HI>&s;upport.</HI>]</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> SUCH plantations as are "<HI>wholly</HI> de&s;titute, and unprovided," &amp;c. And the&s;e be|ing the places more e&s;pecially regarded in the charter, their deplorable and pitiable &s;tate is en|larged upon: They are repre&s;ented as <HI>wholly</HI> de&s;titute of the "<HI>public wor&s;hip</HI> of God;"&mdash; "wanting the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments;"&mdash;"&s;eeming to be abandoned to <HI>athei&s;m</HI> and <HI>infidelity</HI>"&mdash;and in danger of being perverted to "<HI>Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition</HI> and <HI>idolatry.</HI>" Sad &s;tate indeed! but one degree better than that of pagan barbarity. And who that reads this fir&s;t paragraph of the charter, can po&s;&s;ibly doubt, but that the relief of the&s;e places was principally de&s;igned, not only in di&s;tinction from tho&s;e plantations where a tolerable pro|vi&s;ion was already made for mini&s;ters, and the &s;upport of God's public wor&s;hip, but al&s;o in di&s;tinction from tho&s;e where the provi&s;ion was "very mean?"</P>
<P N="5">5. IT is evident that, by "mini&s;ters," or as they are afterwards called, "learned and orthodox
<PB N="21" REF="009441_0019_0F748D8251AEDB00">mini&s;ters," and "an orthodox clergy," were not intended mini&s;ters of any one denomination a|mong&s;t prote&s;tants, exclu&s;ively of others. For this it may &s;uffice at pre&s;ent to a&s;&s;ign only three rea&s;ons: There will be occa&s;ion to re&s;ume the con&s;ideration of this point hereafter, when many others will be given. <HI>Fir&s;t, Orthodox mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> in the charter, &s;tand in direct oppo&s;ition to <HI>Romi&s;h prie&s;ts and je&s;uits</HI>: For it is &s;aid, that for want of the <HI>former,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> were the more encouraged to <HI>pervert</HI> the King's &s;ubjects. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It is not &s;aid, that for want of &s;uch mini&s;ters to in&s;truct the people in the <HI>peculiar</HI> doctrines, di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip of the church of England, or any other particular prote&s;tant church, the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts were thus encourag|ed; but for want of &s;uch to in&s;truct them in the "principles of true religion" in general; or, as it is afterwards expre&s;&s;ed, in "the chri&s;tian religion." There is not the mo&s;t remote hint in the charter, at any controver&s;ies &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting among&s;t prote&s;tants; but only at tho&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted betwixt them and Roman-catholics. The evils propo&s;ed to be reme|died, or guarded again&s;t by this in&s;titution, are tho&s;e of <HI>athei&s;m, infidelity</HI> and <HI>popery</HI>; not the errors, whether real or &s;uppo&s;ed, of any pro|te&s;tants out of the communion of the church of England. It could not even be known from the charter, that there were any di&s;&s;entions a|mong&s;t prote&s;tants; &s;o general, generous and ca|tholic is the language of it; and &s;o far is it from countenancing any party-de&s;ign. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> King
<PB N="22" REF="009441_0020_0F748D8308897490">William him&s;elf was bred up in the Calvini&s;tic principles and di&s;cipline, quite oppo&s;ite in &s;ome re&s;pects to the epi&s;copal; and is generally &s;up|po&s;ed to have retained a regard for the princi|ples of his education all along; tho' as King of England, and Head of that church, there was a nece&s;&s;ity of his externally conforming to its rites and di&s;cipline. Can it be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed then, that in this charter, by <HI>orthodox</HI> mini&s;ters, he intended tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h church in di&s;|tinction from tho&s;e of all other churches in the world; and con&s;equently to brand all the re&s;t as <HI>heterodox</HI>! For this will nece&s;&s;arily be the con|&s;equence; <HI>orthodoxy</HI> being always and only op|po&s;ed to <HI>heterodoxy</HI> or <HI>here&s;y.</HI> To &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>that</HI> noble-&s;pirited Prince had any &s;uch inten|tion, is quite unnatural: And to &s;ay that the Grantees under&s;tood the term orthodox in this narrow, exclu&s;ive &s;en&s;e, is to reflect upon their under&s;tandings as well as their catholici&s;m.</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing ob&s;ervations it ap|pears, that, none of tho&s;e plantations, &amp;c. if any &s;uch there were, in which a tolerable provi&s;ion was made for mini&s;ters, tho' not of the church of England, to admini&s;ter "God's word and &s;a|craments," and to in&s;truct the people in the "principles of true religion," or "the chri&s;tian religion"&mdash;and &s;o, to guard them again&s;t "athe|i&s;m and infidelity" on one hand, and "Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry" on the other, were in any &s;ort the intended objects of this charity. And therefore,</P>
<P>THAT if the &s;ociety have applied any
<PB N="23" REF="009441_0021_0F748D83C079EAF0">part of their fund to &s;upport and encourage the peculiarities of epi&s;copacy in any &s;uch places, they have applied it in a manner not warranted by their charter. And</P>
<P>THIS abu&s;e is &s;o much the greater, if at the &s;ame time they have either neglected to &s;upport God's public wor&s;hip in tho&s;e, plan|tations, &amp;c. which were exactly in the poor and de&s;titute condition repre&s;ented in the charter; or to propagate the go&s;pel among&s;t the heathen bordering on the colonies. This, if real, is a double abu&s;e; with-holding their charity from tho&s;e for whom it was originally de&s;igned, and be&s;towing it upon tho&s;e whom the charter, by natural and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, excludes from it&mdash;The truth of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed facts will be con&s;idered hereafter: In the mean time it will not be ami&s;s to take &s;ome notice of Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s mi&s;takes as to the charter, and the de&s;ign of this in&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.
Of Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s manner of quoting and repre&s;enting the Charter.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman having intimated his intention to determine the que&s;tion "<HI>once for all,</HI> by authentic vouchers;" (<HI>Con&s;id.</HI> p. 7.) &s;ays (p. 8.) <Q>The propo&s;ed vindication is de&s;igned to convince the <HI>candid.</HI> To confute the <HI>ob&s;tinate,</HI> and &s;ilence the <HI>mali|cious,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="009441_0022_0F748D8475AD16C0">is not in the <HI>power of rea&s;on.</HI></Q> From a per&s;on who &s;ets out in this mode&s;t manner, we have doubtle&s;s a right to expect very direct, plain authorities, and great candor, as well as the utmo&s;t clearne&s;s and &s;trength of rea&s;on: For &s;hould he fail in the&s;e re&s;pects, even tho&s;e who are neither uncandid nor malicious, may po&s;&s;ibly remain unconvinced. But in the next page, ju&s;t after a very heroic threatning (in &s;ome lines from VIRGIL) what a &s;evere and de|&s;erved revenge he would take on &s;ome unknown per&s;on who, it &s;eems, had provoked him in a news-paper; we find him taking a method to accompli&s;h his grand de&s;ign of vindicating the Society, &s;o as to convince all but the uncandid and malicious, which does not &s;eem the be&s;t adapted to this end: And that is, <HI>mi&s;-quoting</HI> the charter. He there undertakes to give the words of the charter, which, he &s;ays, "thus <HI>expre&s;&s;es</HI> the de&s;ign of their" [the So|ciety's] "in&s;titution;" and then goes on with the u&s;ual &s;ign or mark of a quotation. Nor, indeed, do I accu&s;e the gentleman of in&s;erting, as from the charter, any words that are not in it. But whoever compares his quotation (p. 9.) with the charter it&s;elf, or only with the pream|ble as it is quoted <HI>verbatim</HI> in the preceeding &s;ection, will find the following particulars true: &mdash;That he has taken the liberty to tran&s;po&s;e &s;ome clau&s;es, and wholly to leave out others, without giving the lea&s;t notice of it to his rea|der in the u&s;ual way, by a blank or &mdash;; and al&s;o that he has thus omitted clau&s;es which are
<PB N="25" REF="009441_0023_0F748D853401B880">very material, in order to a&s;certain the true &s;en&s;e of the charter. For he has intirely dropped the following clau&s;e&mdash;"and &s;eem to be adandoned to <HI>athei&s;m</HI> and <HI>infidelity</HI>"&mdash;and the&s;e al&s;o&mdash;"divers Romi&s;h prie&s;ts and je&s;uits are the more encouraged to pervert and draw over our loving &s;ubjects to <HI>popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition</HI> and <HI>idolatry</HI>;" mi&s;placing the intermediate clau&s;e concerning "learned and orthodox mi|ni&s;ters." And yet the pointing all along in this 9th page, is as it ought to be, if the charter had been quoted <HI>verbatim,</HI> without any omi&s;&s;ions or tran&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>NOW, can even the mo&s;t candid think, this gentleman dealt ingenuou&s;ly by his readers, in thus mangling and ca&s;trating the charter? Or can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he thought the clau&s;es thus &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, were of no u&s;e in a&s;certaining the &s;en&s;e? The importance of them is quite obvious in this re&s;pect; they &s;hew the <HI>very &s;ad</HI> and <HI>deplorable</HI> condition of tho&s;e places, which were in an e&s;pecial manner the objects of this charitable in&s;titution; &mdash; that they were not merely de&s;titute of epi&s;copalian mini&s;ters, but mini&s;ters of any other denomination among prote&s;tants; &s;o as to be in a manner abandoned to <HI>athei&s;m</HI> and <HI>infidelity,</HI> or in great danger of being perverted to <HI>popery.</HI> Con&s;idered in their proper connexion, and in this view, any com|mon man may ea&s;ily &s;ee the importance of the clau&s;es. But it would have ruined his de&s;ign, if it had plainly appeared from his own quota|tion, as it does from the charter it&s;elf, that the
<PB N="26" REF="009441_0024_0F748D8675F58D88">in&s;titution was not intended for the &s;upport of an epi&s;copal clergy, where a competent provi&s;ion was already made for a clergy of the congrega|tional or pre&s;byterian per&s;ua&s;ion; but where there was no competent provi&s;ion made for any mini&s;ters of any denomination among&s;t pro|te&s;tants, capable of in&s;tructing the people in "the principles of true religion," and &s;o, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, guarding them again&s;t the fatal errors of athei&s;m, infidelity and popery. There was therefore evidently an end to be &s;erved, <HI>&s;uch as it was,</HI> by thus mangling and mutilating the charter; whether he had any &s;uch de&s;ign in it or not. For it would an&s;wer his purpo&s;e much be&s;t, to have the true, and very forlorn condition of tho&s;e plantations, &amp;c. kept out of &s;ight as much as po&s;&s;ible, which the royal Founder of the Society had in his mind, and which tho&s;e omitted clau&s;es &s;o clearly and &s;trongly expre&s;s; that &s;o people might be the ea&s;ier induced to believe, that any of the plan|tations where there was no epi&s;copal clergy, were actually the objects of this charity, even tho' they had ever &s;o many mini&s;ters of any other denomination, competently &s;upported. And, that this was his intention, there is hardly any room even for the candid to doubt, when his own words ju&s;t after this extraordinary quotation, are con&s;idered. For there he de|duces this as one of his "certain conclu&s;ions" from that view of the charter which he had given; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That the primary intention of the Society was,&mdash;to provide a maintenance
<PB N="27" REF="009441_0025_0F748D87040196C8">for an orthodox clergy; which (as the charter was obtained by the members of the Church of England) mu&s;t&mdash;mean a clergy of their own church.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;id.</HI> p. 10, 11.</NOTE> It might indeed be naturally expected that the Society, being at lea&s;t chiefly epi&s;copalians, whenever they &s;ent mi&s;|&s;ionaries abroad, would &s;end tho&s;e of their own communion. But it will not from hence fol|low, that they were to &s;end and &s;upport &s;uch, in any or all of the colonies indifferently, where a competent provi&s;ion was already, or &s;hould be made, for prote&s;tant mini&s;ters of an|other communion. This latter is what the defence of the &s;ociety requires; and it is a &s;ophi&s;m, perhaps unde&s;igned, which runs thro' the <HI>Con&s;iderations.</HI> But of this more hereafter. &mdash;If Mr. Apthorp did not perceive tho&s;e clau&s;es which he has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in &s;o &s;ingular a man|ner, to be of any importance, I blu&s;h for him as a reputed Scholar: But if knowing them to be &s;o, he omitted them in order to impo&s;e upon his unwary readers, and the better to di&s;gui&s;e the true de&s;ign of that excellent in&s;titution, I am quite in pain for him as a Chri&s;tian;&mdash; e&s;pecially as One who is by office, I would hope by example al&s;o, an in&s;tructor of others in chri&s;tian <HI>&s;implicity</HI> and godly <HI>&s;incerity.</HI></P>
<P>BUT whatever might be his de&s;ign therein, which is left to his own reflections, he has not left out enough of the charter to an&s;wer his pur|po&s;e. Tho&s;e remaining clau&s;es&mdash;"provi&s;ion for mini&s;ters is <HI>very mean</HI>"&mdash;"<HI>wholly</HI> de&s;titute and unprovided of a maintenance for mini&s;ters, and
<PB N="28" REF="009441_0026_0F748D8773743208">the <HI>publick wor&s;hip of God</HI>"&mdash;"mini&s;ters to in&s;truct our loving &s;ubjects in the <HI>principles of true religion</HI>;&mdash;"<HI>want</HI> the admini&s;tration of <HI>God's word</HI> and &s;acraments;"&mdash;which are all de&s;criptive of the pitiable &s;tate of the places who&s;e relief was de&s;igned by this charitable foundation, are &s;ufficient to invalidate his <HI>defence</HI> of the Society, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the clau&s;es &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner. For if it can be &s;hewn that the Society maintain many mi&s;&s;ions and &s;chools in tho&s;e plantations, &amp;c. to which no part of this de&s;cription is applicable, but quite the rever&s;e is true; the gentleman mu&s;t certainly <HI>con&s;ider</HI> at lea&s;t <HI>once again,</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on</HI> a little more clo&s;ely, before he will convince the candid and judicious, that the Society have not mi&s;applied their fund. The charter warrants them to maintain no mi&s;|&s;ions or &s;chools in the colonies, but in &s;uch places as an&s;wer to the de&s;criptions in the charter; in order to make converts to the church of England from chri&s;tians of other denominations. The charter knows of no di&s;tinction among&s;t chri&s;tians, except that of prote&s;tants and papi&s;ts: Its grand object, a truly glorious one, is, to promote chri&s;tianity, con|&s;idered in oppo&s;ition to athei&s;m, infidelity and popery; not epi&s;copacy and the liturgy of the church of England, in oppo&s;ition to pre&s;byte|riani&s;m, &amp;c. Tho' if the profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tia|nity is upheld, or if the go&s;pel is propagated at all, it is readily acknowledged that this mu&s;t be done in &s;ome particular way, mode or form. And
<PB N="29" REF="009441_0027_0F748D8A4EA16068">when epi&s;copalians do any thing to the&s;e ends, it is to be expected that they will do it in that way, mode or form, which them&s;elves mo&s;t approve. Neither is this the thing objected again&s;t in the pre&s;ent argument; but, the So|ciety's turning their arms, as it were, again&s;t other prote&s;tants; and expending a great pro|portion of their monies in &s;upporting a party.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV.
Of &s;ome other Things tending to explain and confirm the Sen&s;e of the Charter, and the de&s;ign of the In&s;titution afore&s;aid.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE name it&s;elf by which this re&s;pec|table corporation is di&s;tingui&s;hed and known, is agreeable to the &s;pirit of the charter as before explained: <HI>The Society for the propagation of the</HI> GOSPEL, &amp;c. From this name or title any one would naturally con|clude, that if heathens and barbarians were not the more immediate objects of the charitable in|&s;titution, but only the more remote; yet it had for its object people in very deplorable circum|&s;tances at be&s;t; &s;uch as were in a manner de&s;ti|tute of God's word and &s;acraments, or the means of grace. It would never enter into any one's heart to conceive, that any part of its de&s;ign was, the building up any one prote&s;tant church on
<PB N="30" REF="009441_0028_0F748D8B21A0F688">the ruins of others. Thus the name of the So|ciety, and the charter well agree. But accord|ing to &s;ome things which Mr. Apthorp and others have advanced, not to &s;ay at pre&s;ent, ac|cording to &s;ome proceedings of the Society, it ought rather to have been called, <HI>The Society for propagating the church of England, in tho&s;e parts where the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments is provided for, after the con|gregational and presbyterian modes.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE common &s;eal of the Society, which often &s;erves as a fronti&s;piece to the charter, is agreeable both to the charter and name of the Society. The device is, a &s;un in the upper part of a circle, &s;hining gloriou&s;ly on the world; a natural and noble emblem of the <HI>&s;un of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; of Him that &s;aid, "I am the light of the world." Within the circle to the right, is a &s;hip under full &s;ail; on the prow of which &s;tands a clergyman with a book in his hand, (I &s;uppo&s;e intended for the Bible) which he ex|tends to a company of naked &s;avages on the left, who are eagerly thronging to the &s;hore, to meet and receive the ble&s;&s;ing. Ju&s;t over them is a &s;croll with the&s;e words, <HI>Tran&s;iens adjuva nos</HI>; alluding to Acts xvi. 9. "Come over&mdash;and help us:" the words of the man of Macedonia, whom St. Paul &s;aw in a vi&s;ion; from whence he infer|red that the Lord called him "to preach the go&s;pel" to the heathen there. And in the out|ward circle or circumference of the &s;eal, is the afore&s;aid title or name of the Society. This is a fine device for the &s;eal of &s;uch a &s;ociety, ac|cording to its name and charter.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="31" REF="009441_0029_0F748D8B5B613F30">3. THE &s;ermons preached annually before the Society, in the general &s;train and tenor of them, corre&s;pond very exactly to the noble de|&s;ign of the in&s;titution, as before repre&s;ented. The grand topic in&s;i&s;ted on in them, is promot|ing THE GOSPEL; the undoubted doctrines and duties of the Chri&s;tian religion. The preachers on the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;eem evidently, however, to have had the heathen in their minds, rather than profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians who only needed a&s;&s;i&s;tance in order to the &s;upport of God's wor|&s;hip and ordinances: In which re&s;pect the &s;er|mons rather coincide with the ultimate than the more immediate de&s;ign of the in&s;titution; and &s;o harmonize rather more perhaps with the &s;eal and name of the &s;ociety, than with the charter. This is not &s;aid with the lea&s;t de&s;ign to reflect on the preachers of them, as if they had for|gotten the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution, which is indeed kept in view in tho&s;e &s;ermons; tho', as was intimated before, the ultimate de&s;ign of the in&s;titution is much more enlarged on, than the primary or more direct.

It will now be proper to come to &s;ome facts relative to the conduct of the Society in planting churches, and &s;upport|ing mi&s;&s;ions in America. And as the principal objection lies again&s;t their conduct as to New-England, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;et the objection in a fair and true light, in the fir&s;t place to make &s;ome remarks on the &s;tate of re|ligion here, before the Society &s;ent any mi&s;&s;i|onaries into the&s;e parts, and &s;ince. This is propo&s;ed in the pre&s;ent &s;ection. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is well known, that the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of New-England were &s;uch as came hither chiefly on account of their &s;ufferings for non-conformi|ty to the church of England. They fled hither as to an a&s;&s;ylum from epi&s;copal per&s;ecution, &s;e|conded by royal power; which often conde|&s;cended to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the views of domi|neering prelates, before the glorious revolution. That this was the occa&s;ion of their flight hither, appears even from the Society's own publica|tions. Thus in the <HI>Account of the foundation, proceedings and &s;ucce&s;s of the Society,</HI> publi&s;hed Anno 1706, it is &s;aid, (p. 10.) <Q><HI>It mu&s;t be ac|knowledged,</HI> that it was the unhappine&s;s of New England and the adjoining parts, to be fir&s;t planted and inhabited by per&s;ons who were generally di&s;affected to the church by law
<PB N="40" REF="009441_0038_0F748D92D3A9D040">e&s;tabli&s;ht in England; and had <HI>many of them</HI> taken <HI>refuge</HI> or <HI>retirement</HI> in tho&s;e parts, on account of their <HI>&s;uffering</HI> for non-conformity here at home.</Q>
This fact mu&s;t indeed be <HI>con|fe&s;&s;ed</HI>; and that it was their <HI>unhappine&s;s</HI> to &s;uffer thus, ought to be confe&s;&s;ed al&s;o. But, that it was the unhappine&s;s of New-England to be fir&s;t plant|ed and inhabited by the&s;e con&s;cientious non-con|formi&s;ts to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England, is not &s;o clear a point: Neither is it to be won|dered at, if they were <HI>di&s;affected</HI> to &s;uch a cruel, per&s;ecuting church as that was before the re|volution.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is no le&s;s certain that the&s;e <HI>refugees</HI> were very far from being per&s;ons of a loo&s;e, ir|religious character. Had they been void of con|&s;cience toward God, they would not have &s;uf|fered &s;o much for non-conformity, and fled their dear native country, for the &s;ake of &s;erv|ing him without fear in a wilderne&s;s. If they had been per&s;ons void of religious principle, they would in all probability have lived and died in the communion of that church, for di&s;&s;enting from which they &s;uffered &s;o much.&mdash;That they were a &s;ober, virtuous and religious &s;et of people in general, is certain: Tho', that they were per|fect, or free from all human errors and frailties, is not pretended.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is well known that they very early made provi&s;ion for the public wor&s;hip of God, and founded a &s;eminary of learning, which has been encrea&s;ing and flouri&s;hing to the pre&s;ent time. The zeal which they &s;hewed both for
<PB N="41" REF="009441_0039_0F748D93752170C0">learning and religion, from the fir&s;t, was in|deed very uncommon; and greatly to their honor. The public wor&s;hip of God, and the admini&s;tration of his word and &s;acraments, have all along been provided for in New-England: I mean, in the Province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay</HI> and in <HI>Connecticut</HI>; which two may contain perhaps about eight parts in ten of the inhabitants of New-England. In the other two &s;mall governments, <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land and Providence Plantations,</HI> there has, to be &s;ure, been much le&s;s care taken for the &s;upport of a public wor&s;hip. But in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> the public profe&s;|&s;ion of religion has all along been very regu|larly upheld, nearly after the &s;ame mode of profe&s;&s;ion. The doctrines almo&s;t univer&s;ally profe&s;&s;ed in both, are and ever have been, ve|ry agreeable to the doctrinal articles of the church of England. Their external polity, and form of wor&s;hip, are indeed known to be different; the churches of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> the principal New-England government, being generally of the <HI>congregational</HI> per&s;wa|&s;ion, which the epi&s;copalians affect to reproach under the name of <HI>independency</HI>; and tho&s;e in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> of the <HI>presbyterian</HI>; or at lea&s;t ap|proaching nearer to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of Scotland.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is farther to be ob&s;erved, that in the&s;e two principal governments of New-England there has been, not only provi&s;ion, but <HI>legal</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="009441_0040_0F748D95B2D6E868">provi&s;ion made for the &s;upport of a <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>orthodox</HI> mini&s;try, and of &s;chools; and that, before the Society for propagating the go&s;pel had a being.

<P N="6">6.

<PB N="45" REF="009441_0043_0F748D97407D7D00">been &s;een in New-England, till after remo|ving the French from Nova-Scotia, and di&s;|per&s;ing them in the colonies. The&s;e are a plain, &s;imple, ignorant people, who have now no Romi&s;h prie&s;ts or Je&s;uits among&s;t them; and by whom we are &s;urely in no danger of being perverted from the prote&s;tant faith. How much better then, in all the&s;e re&s;pects, is the &s;tate of religion among&s;t us, than it is even in England, under the immediate eye and do|cuments of the venerable bi&s;hops? Where, notwith&s;tanding all their pious endeavours, there are &s;o many Roman-catholics, Infidels and Sceptics, if not right down Athei&s;ts! It may be added, that the common people in New-England, by means of our &s;chools, and the in&s;tructions of our "able, learned, orthodox mini&s;ters", are, and have all along been, phi|lo&s;ophers and divines in compari&s;on of the common people in England, of the commu|nion of the church there e&s;tabli&s;hed. This is commonly &s;aid by tho&s;e who have had an op|portunity per&s;onally to inform them&s;elves: And a rationale might be given of the fact, e|ven without any reflexion on the church afore&s;aid.</P>
<P N="8">8. AS to practical religion, tho' we have no cau&s;e for boa&s;ting, yet, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, we have no cau&s;e for blu&s;hing on a compari&s;on of our morals with tho&s;e of the people in England, in the communion of that church: And many vices that are common there, are
<PB N="46" REF="009441_0044_0F748D97FA4490A0">almo&s;t, if not quite unknown here. So that if we appeal to fact and experience, there is much le&s;s danger of irreligion in principle or practice, and of Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition and ido|latry prevailing in New-England, among&s;t the Presbyterians and Congregationali&s;ts, for want of learned, orthodox and pious mini&s;ters "to in&s;truct them in the principles of <HI>true religion,</HI>" than there is of their prevailing in England: Tho' in the <HI>Ab&s;tracts</HI> annexed to the bi&s;hop of Clogher's &s;ermon before the So|ciety, 1714, (p. 53.) there is indeed an inti|mation that the <HI>Epi&s;copalians</HI> in America are in imminent danger of falling into tho&s;e errors, for want of bi&s;hops to re&s;ide among&s;t them. And &s;hould any be &s;ent hither, to prevent the&s;e evils among&s;t the people of that commu|nion, it is to be hoped they will have better &s;ucce&s;s in &s;o pious an undertaking, than the bi&s;hops have hitherto had in England&mdash;</P>
<P N="9">9. FROM the foregoing faithful, tho' brief repre&s;entation of religion in New-England, from the time that the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of it were per&s;ecuted out of England by the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, to the pre&s;ent, (I &s;peak particularly of the two principal governments of New-England) it appears that there neither is nor has been any occa&s;ion for the Society to &s;up|port mi&s;&s;ions and &s;chools here; and that they had not even a warrant for doing &s;o, by their charter. New-England (the two &s;mall go|vernments of New-Hamp&s;hire and Rhode-I&s;land
<PB N="47" REF="009441_0045_0F748D98F59F0530">excepted) does by no means an&s;wer to the de&s;cription of tho&s;e plantations, &amp;c. in the charter, for &s;upporting "God's public wor|&s;hip" in which, a charitable provi&s;ion is there|by made.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be &s;aid, (which is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible thing that can be &s;aid) that in &s;ome parts even of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connec&s;i|cut, the provi&s;ion made for the maintenance of mini&s;ters has been "very mean," and that therefore they come within the true de&s;ign of the charter; &s;everal things may be ob&s;erved in an&s;wer hereto. Fir&s;t, good mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST, who have the intere&s;t of religion at heart, do not a&s;pire after worldly <HI>riches, pomp</HI> and <HI>grandeur.</HI> Secondly, the provi&s;ion for mini&s;ters here, tho' not to be compared with the rich benefices in England, has not yet been &s;o "very mean," but that a competent number of learned and orthodox mini&s;ters have been found to &s;upply our churches. Thirdly, the government here, which took the &s;upport of mini&s;ters into con&s;ideration be|fore the Society was founded, mu&s;t in rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed more capable of judging, what a competent provi&s;ion for them is, in this coun|try, than the venerable Society. But, fourth|ly, if notwith&s;tanding this legal provi&s;ion, a number of them in &s;ome of our poor, &s;mall, or frontier towns, have been "very meanly" provided for; (which is not denied) and this is alledged as bringing &s;uch places within the true
<PB N="48" REF="009441_0046_0F748D9978DDC8F8">intent of the charter; I will allow the perti|nence and validity of the argument, upon ei|ther of the two following &s;uppo&s;itions. Fir&s;t, that the charitable Society have remitted &s;ome|thing from time to time to <HI>our</HI> poor, tho' learn|ed, orthodox and pious mini&s;ters, &s;ettled in <HI>&s;uch</HI> places, for their help and encouragement; which would have been quite agreeable to the &s;pirit of the charter, and the catholic princi|ples of the royal <HI>Grantor,</HI> however aliene it might po&s;&s;ibly have been from the principles and views of the epi&s;copal <HI>Grantees.</HI> Or &s;e|condly, if it appears that the Society have ac|tually e&s;tabli&s;hed their <HI>own</HI> mi&s;&s;ions in &s;uch poor, little or expo&s;ed places only, in&s;tead of doing it in our riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous towns, where the be&s;t provi&s;ion was before made for mini&s;ters. But if neither of the&s;e things can be made to appear, it will be in vain, and indeed a piece of hypocri&s;y, to allege the "very mean" &s;upport of mini&s;ters here, as an argument for the Society's applying a great part of their revenue for the maintenance of God's public wor&s;hip in New-England.</P>
<P>That there was very little, or rather no oc|ca&s;ion for Mi&s;&s;ionaries in New-England, Mr. HOBART has very pertinently produced the te&s;timony of the pious and judicious Dr. BRAY, who, before the Society's incorporation, was the bi&s;hop of London's commi&s;&s;ary in Mary|land. This worthy divine took great pains to inform him&s;elf of the &s;tate of religion in
<PB N="49" REF="009441_0047_0F748D9A39D98A30">the colonies, and their various exigencies; of which he publi&s;hed an Account, and delivered it as the re&s;ult of his inquiries, that <Q>from New-York northward, he found <HI>very little need</HI> of mi&s;&s;ionaries for the propagation of chri&s;tianity; and in the colonies of Connec|ticut and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts NONE AT ALL.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Second Addre&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. p. 126.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THIS te&s;timony of Dr. BRAY ought to have the more weight, not only becau&s;e he was &s;uch a leading man with reference to the charitable in|&s;titution afore&s;aid, as to have been honoured with name of "the Father of the Society"; but becau&s;e of the great re&s;pect with which I find the Society &s;peaking of him, of his conduct in, and his account of the Affairs of America, in the following words&mdash; <Q>The Lord bi&s;hop of London&mdash;did afterwards &s;end over the Rev. Dr. THOMAS BRAY, as his commi&s;&s;ary to Maryland; who being a&s;&s;i&s;ted&mdash;did &s;ettle and &s;upport &s;everal new mini&s;ters in that province, and did fix and furni&s;h &s;ome parochial libra|ries, and did other public &s;ervices, of which he has him&s;elf given a TRUE and mode&s;t account <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Account of the Society,</HI> p. 14.</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ubmitted to the judgment of the im|partial reader, whether the afore&s;aid te&s;timony of Dr. BRAY, &s;o inqui&s;itive, ob&s;erving and active a man, is not more than a balance to the te&s;ti|mony which Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> produces from the Dean, afterward bp. BERKLEY's &s;ermon before
<PB N="50" REF="009441_0048_0F748D9B05ED5968">the Society;&mdash;"that the likelie&s;t Step towards converting the heathen, would be to begin with the Engli&s;h.

The excellent Dr. BERKLEY lived a re|clu&s;e, &s;tudious life the greate&s;t part of the time he was in N.

England, or any part thereof, but of the colonies in general; thinking that the mi&s;&s;ionaries in them do good &s;ervice in bringing the Engli&s;h to a <HI>&s;erious &s;en&s;e of religion.</HI> Which is doubtle&s;s true as to &s;ome of the colonies: Tho' the peo|ple of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut had at lea&s;t as <HI>&s;erious a &s;en&s;e of religion,</HI> long before there was a &s;ingle mi&s;&s;ionary in them, as they have had &s;ince.

So that if they &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries into the&s;e colonies, it cannot be &s;o much to propagate <HI>chri&s;tianity,</HI> as to propagate <HI>&s;omething di&s;tinct from it, viz.</HI> the <HI>peculiarities</HI> of the church of England.</P>

<P>THAT the Society have <HI>chiefly</HI> &s;ent their mi&s;&s;ionaries into tho&s;e Briti&s;h plantations where they were much needed, according to the true de&s;ign of their in&s;titution; and that they have hereby &s;erved the intere&s;t of religion in them, is by no means denied: It were very criminal to deny them the prai&s;e that is ju&s;tly due to them in this re&s;pect. But, that they have deviated from their original plan according to the charter, in &s;ome other re&s;pects; and thereby left undone much of the good which they might probably have effected, with the ordinary ble&s;&s;ing of God, may perhaps be equally evident from this and the following &s;ections. Mo&s;t of the following facts are very notorious, even from the anniver&s;ary &s;ermons, <HI>ab&s;tracts,</HI> and other pub|lications of the Society; &s;o that they will not be denied.</P>
<P N="1">1. FOR &s;everal years, I think about eight or nine, after the Society was founded, they &s;ent no mi&s;&s;ionary into N. England. Which may naturally be looked on as one argument, that it was not originally con&s;idered among tho&s;e plantations
<PB N="52" REF="009441_0050_0F748D9C9B80F078">which were &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand in need of their charity <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There was no church of E. in N.

It was at this time that <Q>the Ld. bp. of London, upon an addre&s;s of &s;everal of the inhabitants of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> did prevail with his Maje&s;ty [afore&s;aid] that a church &s;hould be allowed in that town, for the exerci&s;e of religion according to the church of E.</Q> [<HI>Ac|count of the Society,</HI> p. 11.] If I mi&s;take not, there was no mi&s;|&s;ionary from the Society in N.

E. <HI>viz,</HI> one at Rhode-I&s;land, another at Marblehead, and a third at Newbury; according to the <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> for that year, p. 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY have from time to time, &s;ince they began to &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries into the&s;e parts, been adding to their number, &s;upporting epi&s;copal &s;chools, &amp;c.</P>

<P>IT does not appear from the <HI>ab&s;tracts,</HI> that the Society have any mi&s;&s;ionaries at all in the other W. India I&s;lands, where, as is commonly reported, there is hardly any &s;hew of public wor&s;hip kept up, of any kind; and where there are &s;o many thou&s;ands of Negro &s;laves in total ignorance of chri&s;tianity. The true cau&s;e of this neglect may be &s;een hereafter.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is notorious that the mi&s;&s;ionaries, in|&s;tead of being &s;ent to the frontier and other poor Towns in N. England, where the provi&s;ion and accommodations for mini&s;ters were the <HI>meane&s;t,</HI> have generally been &s;tation'd in the olde&s;t, mo&s;t populous and riche&s;t towns, where the <HI>be&s;t</HI> pro|vi&s;ion was before made for mini&s;ters; where
<PB N="54" REF="009441_0052_0F748D9EB32FBE98">the public wor&s;hip of God was con&s;tantly and regularly upheld, and his word and &s;acraments duly admini&s;tred according to the congregatio|nal and pre&s;byterian modes. This will be evi|dent to all that are in any mea&s;ure acquainted with this country, from the bare mention of &s;ome of the places where the Society &s;upport mi&s;&s;ions and &s;chools; <HI>viz.</HI> Bo&s;ton, Cambridge, Salem, Marblehead, Newbury, Port&s;mouth in New-Hamp&s;hire, Braintree, Scituate, Bri&s;tow, Port&s;mouth in Rhode-I&s;land, N. London, Strat|ford, Fairfield, Middletown, &amp;c. I have al&s;o under&s;tood that there is a church of England in N. Haven, the &s;eat of the College in Connec|ticut; tho' I do not find by the <HI>ab&s;tracts,</HI> that there is yet any mi&s;&s;ionary fixed there. It is not denied, however, that there arc a few mi&s;&s;ions e&s;tabli&s;hed in N. England, particularly in Rhode-I&s;land government, where they might be needed.</P>
<P N="4">4. It needs not to be proved, but only re|membered, that the&s;e mi&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. have not been &s;upported, but at a large annual expence of the Society. The amount of the &s;alaries here, exclu&s;ive of books to be di&s;tributed, &amp;c. for the year 1761, was about &pound;. 1270 &s;terling, according to the <HI>ab&s;tract.</HI> The other expences of the Society for N. England being added hereto, might probably make up the &s;um of &pound;.1500 &s;terl. <HI>communibus annis,</HI> for many years pa&s;t: Tho' I pretend not to be very exact in this calculation.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="55" REF="009441_0053_0F748DA12129B348">5. TO tho&s;e who are well acquainted with N. England, and the manner and circum&s;tances in which epi&s;copal churches have been gathered and founded here, it appears that the Society have manife&s;ted a <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> forwardne&s;s to encourage and increa&s;e <HI>&s;mall di&s;affected</HI> parties in our towns, upon an application to them;&mdash;in tho&s;e towns, I mean, where a regular, legal and due provi&s;ion was already made for the &s;upport of God's pub|lic wor&s;hip. Some of the&s;e little parties, or rather factions, it is well known here, have taken their ri&s;e from no fixed principle of a con&s;cien|tious di&s;&s;ent from our manner of wor&s;hip, but from mere levity, petulance or avarice;&mdash;from &s;ome trifling, groundle&s;s di&s;gu&s;t at the &s;tated mi|ni&s;ter; or a di&s;&s;atisfaction about pews and rates; or at their being under, or likely to come under cen&s;ure for their immoral practices. I do not affirm po&s;itively, that either of the&s;e has always been the ca&s;e, without exception: But, that it often has been, is as well known among&s;t us, as a thing of that nature can be known. The&s;e people being thus affronted and angry without cau&s;e, pre&s;ently declare for the <HI>church,</HI> without really knowing any thing of the &s;tate of the controver&s;y; and apply to &s;ome mi&s;&s;ionary or mi&s;&s;ionaries, to recommend them to the charity of the Society. And divers of the mi&s;&s;ionaries have been much injured, (which there is no rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e) if they have not been very bu&s;y in intrigues in order to foment the&s;e divi&s;ions and parties, <HI>for the good of the church</HI>; yea,
<PB N="56" REF="009441_0054_0F748DA1E91EF658">been at the bottom of them. In which they perhaps thought, they conformed to the true de&s;ign of that &s;tanding direction of the Society to their mi&s;&s;ionaries; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That they fre|quently vi&s;it&mdash;tho&s;e that <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> them, or <HI>di&s;|&s;ent</HI> from them, to convince and reclaim them&mdash;</Q> They add indeed, <Q>with a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s;</Q> which &s;eems not to have been &s;o much remembered in all ca&s;es, as the other branch of the direction.</P>
<P>BUT from whatever cau&s;e the&s;e little di&s;con|tented parties have generally taken their origin, in towns where there were learned and orthodox mini&s;ters duly &s;upported; thus much is certain, that they have not only been recommended to the Society from time to time, but been en|couraged thereby, and had mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent to them. The number of the&s;e humble &s;uppli|cants in a town, have &s;ometimes not exceeded eight, ten or twelve heads of families; and this in towns con&s;i&s;ting of two or three hundred families. It is commonly, and I believe truly &s;aid, that there are &s;carce &s;o many as ten fa|milies in the town of Cambridge, which u&s;ually attend the &s;ervice of the church lately &s;et up therein, but about half a quarter of a mile from the College, and from the meeting-hou&s;e there. What is this but &s;etting up altar again&s;t altar? And &s;ome there are, who think the principal end, and true &s;pirit of that mi&s;&s;ion was not ill ex|plained by an epi&s;copalian, who, as is reported, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus on the occa&s;ion&mdash; <Q>I
<PB N="57" REF="009441_0055_0F748DA2792A00B0">don't care for them; we have now got a church in the very <HI>munns</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A cant term well under&s;tood among us.</NOTE> of 'em.</Q> It is a known fact, that in &s;ome other churches, which, ac|cording to the <HI>ab&s;tracts,</HI> have been repre&s;ented as growing, flouri&s;hing, and increa&s;ing in reputation for near half a century, the number of &s;tated wor&s;hippers at this day very little, if any thing, exceeds ten or twelve families. The&s;e &s;mall parties thus encouraged and &s;upported by the Society in different parts of New-England at a great expence, have in &s;hort all the appearance of entering wedges; or rather of little lodg|ments made in carrying on the cru&s;ade, or &s;piri|tual &s;iege of our churches, with the hope that they will one day &s;ubmit to an epi&s;copal &s;overeign. And it will appear at lea&s;t probable in the &s;equel, that this has long been the formal de&s;ign of the Society; and that it is the true plan, and grand my&s;tery of their operations in New-England.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT is well known to us in New-England, that after &s;upporting and encouraging the&s;e lit|tle parties, till in &s;ome places they have, by one means or other, become con&s;iderable both for number and riches, and well able to &s;up|port their own mini&s;ters; the Society have &s;till continued to pay the&s;e out of their charitable fund. The only rea&s;on why I do not come to particulars here, is, left it &s;hould &s;eem too invi|dious. This conduct of the Society, for &s;ome years proved no incon&s;iderable means of in|crea&s;ing the church-party: I mean, till a law of this province was made, obliging the epi&s;co|palians,
<PB N="58" REF="009441_0056_0F748DA333BD50C8">to pay mini&s;terial rates in common with other people; the money levied on them, how|ever, to go to the &s;upport of <HI>their own clergy.</HI> This law &s;eemed to give &s;ome check to the progre&s;s of epi&s;copacy, and a zeal for the liturgy, in New-England. And if there had been no &s;uch act, or the epi&s;copalians had been exempted from all mini&s;terial taxes, as the Quakers are, almo&s;t all who loved their money better than <HI>any thing el&s;e,</HI> might in the cour&s;e of a few years have declared them&s;elves for, and adorned the communion of the church&mdash; But this is not de&s;igned as a general reflexion on the people of that communion here; &s;ome of whom are doubtle&s;s per&s;ons of principle, and &s;incere piety.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Bo&s;ton, <DATE>Nov. 1712</DATE>.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM altogether a <HI>&s;tranger</HI> to you, and mu&s;t needs be <HI>unknown</HI>; for my name is much too <HI>little</HI> to have been heard of by per&s;ons of your <HI>dignity</HI> in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. But meet|ing with your excellent <HI>&s;ermon</HI> preached be|fore the honourable and mo&s;t reverend <HI>Society</HI> &mdash;I cannot forbear a&s;king your leave to write you my thoughts upon an admirable pa&s;&s;age I find therein, p. 22.</P>
<P>NEITHER our <HI>own</HI> people in tho&s;e parts, nor their African <HI>&s;laves,</HI> nor their <HI>Indian</HI> neighbours have ought to accu&s;e us of. At lea&s;t we have given no ju&s;t <HI>offence</HI> to the <HI>Gen|tiles</HI> there, nor to the church of God. We tru&s;t we have not &s;inned again&s;t the <HI>brethren,</HI> and have walked hone&s;tly toward them that are without. We give our money, our at|tendance, our corre&s;pondence, our &s;everal &s;orts of care, pains and trouble: Forgive us this wrong: If we have done any other, God do &s;o to us, and more al&s;o.</P>
<P>SIR, there is &s;uch an air of <HI>&s;incerity</HI> in the&s;e words, that I cannot but have a perfect <HI>e&s;teem</HI> of the good, and truly noble &s;pirit breathed in them. I doubt not but you fully believe as
<PB N="60" REF="009441_0058_0F748DA4C06D15C8">you &s;peak, and are accepted by God in your pious de&s;ires of &s;erving the intere&s;ts of religion in the&s;e remote parts of the earth. I greatly honor the <HI>intentions</HI> of your mo&s;t honourable Society, their abundant labors and expence.</P>
<P>A MORE noble charity never was projected than your &s;ending the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> among the <HI>hea|then</HI> here, and into <HI>heatheni&s;h</HI> places, where the &s;ettlements have been made void of the form of religion. The <HI>harve&s;t</HI> of this nature is too plentious thro' <HI>Virginia, Maryland,</HI> the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> our <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> country al&s;o, and the <HI>Nar|ragan&s;ett,</HI> and &s;ome places about <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> which have been too long <HI>neglected,</HI> and &s;uf|fered to run wild into <HI>&s;ectaries,</HI> and prejudicies again&s;t any mini&s;try of the word at all.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>va&s;t</HI> and <HI>wa&s;te</HI> &s;pace, de&s;olate and pe|ri&s;hing, cries aloud to you for your charitable care: And verily the <HI>fund</HI> which the Society has contributed and gathered is but too little yet by far, for the&s;e nece&s;&s;itous places; while at the &s;ame time many of your mi&s;&s;ions into our parts, are unto places where the go&s;pel is received and preached, and churches gathered in very good order and manner.&mdash;I cannot but let you know my thoughts, that the reve|rend and honourable Society have been once and again mi&s;led, and even impo&s;ed on by mi&s;-informations, and private de&s;igns and in|tere&s;ts, of per&s;ons and parties here, to mi&s;|&s;pend (and &s;o nece&s;&s;arily pervert) great portions of their noble charity, to &s;uch <HI>ends</HI> and in &s;uch <HI>manner</HI> as do not at all an&s;wer the <HI>pro|pagation
<PB N="61" REF="009441_0059_0F748DA5743BA888">of the go&s;pel</HI> among us, but which do really break in upon and hinder the &s;preading and &s;ucce&s;s of it. To evince which, I will fairly put the ca&s;e, and offer an in&s;tance or two.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t give me leave, Sir, to &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>town</HI> and <HI>towns</HI> here, wherein <HI>religion</HI> is &s;ettled, <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> legally fixed, the word of God faithfully <HI>preached,</HI> and the <HI>&s;acraments</HI> of Chri&s;t admini&s;tred; and yet there happen a di&s;contented per&s;on or two in the place; or &s;ome difference about the placing a new <HI>hou&s;e</HI> for public wor&s;hip, or about paying their little <HI>rate</HI> to the mini&s;try, or the like: Immediately they are advi&s;ed, or in their own mind they propo&s;e to them&s;elves, <Q>Let us &s;end over to the <HI>Lord bi&s;hop of London,</HI> or to the honour|able Society for propagating the go&s;pel, for a mini&s;ter of the church of England! He will bring a &s;alary of &pound;. 50 &s;terling</Q>&mdash;Now &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, they actually &s;end and obtain, I demand, whether it be not a real injury and <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of the Society and their charity; their declared end, and the proper <HI>u&s;e</HI> of &s;o <HI>great a gift</HI> as fifty pound <HI>per annum</HI> is?&mdash;Yet are there &s;e|veral &s;uch notorious in&s;tances in our <HI>New-Engli&s;h provinces.</HI> One was lately in the town of <HI>Braintree,</HI> within ten miles of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which <HI>application</HI> to you the Rev. Mr. <HI>Miles</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> refu&s;ed to countenance; and was free to &s;ay, that were the circum&s;tances of the place known, my Lord of <HI>London</HI> and the Society would never approve of it: For it is a notorious matter of fact, that &s;etting a&s;ide
<PB N="62" REF="009441_0060_0F748DA633B66358"><HI>two families</HI> in that party at <HI>Braintree,</HI> the re&s;t neither <HI>know why</HI> they &s;ought the <HI>church wor|&s;hip</HI> there, nor could be any <HI>credit</HI> to it. Their number was &s;o very <HI>minute,</HI> and their cha|racter &s;o very <HI>mean,</HI> that when a mini&s;ter was &s;ent to them, he was <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> of his errand, and diverted to &s;ome other place of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t year a difference happened in the town of <HI>Newbury</HI> about placing their <HI>meeting-hou&s;e</HI>: The matter was brought before our <HI>general court,</HI> who determined it according to the free vote and act of the <HI>precinct,</HI> whereby they had obliged them&s;elves to each other. Whereupon a number of them declare them|&s;elves for the <HI>church of England</HI>; many of them, I will &s;uppo&s;e, per&s;ons of &s;obriety and virtue, only in a <HI>pet,</HI> and to &s;ave their <HI>rate</HI> to their aged and worthy mini&s;ter, Mr. Belcher; utterly <HI>ignorant</HI> of the church they declare for, nor <HI>offended</HI> in the lea&s;t with the form of wor|&s;hip or dicipline which they turn from;&mdash;be|ing till now among the mo&s;t <HI>narrow</HI> and <HI>rigid</HI> di&s;&s;enters.&mdash;</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, Sir, there is a <HI>&s;ordid motive</HI> which will find you <HI>beggars</HI> enough for your charity in our country-towns! if you will free them from <HI>rates</HI> to any mini&s;try, and <HI>maintain</HI> it for them&mdash;You will be&s;t judge, Sir, if there be no <HI>offence</HI> to the church of God, in the &s;teps taken by too many, <HI>here</HI> and <HI>there.</HI>&mdash;</P>

<P>NOW, the manner in which epi&s;copal churches have been founded in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut, has all along in general borne but too near a re&s;emblance to that repre&s;ented in Dr. COLMAN's letter afore&s;aid: And the wor|thy Dean was &s;o ju&s;t as to expre&s;s his intire be|lief of what the Dr. &s;aid <HI>relating to the places which he mentioned</HI>; &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e repre&s;en|tations to be &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>plain truths,</HI> which too often draw people into <HI>controver&s;y</HI> and <HI>envy.</HI> He al&s;o &s;peaks of it as the primary de&s;ign of the Society's in&s;titution, to plant epi&s;copal churches <Q>in tho&s;e parts of our Engli&s;h plantations, where there is <HI>no &s;ettled mini&s;try</HI>;</Q> tho' not exclu|&s;ively of tho&s;e, where there are <Q><HI>good num|bers</HI> who cannot <HI>in con&s;cience</HI> conform to the ways of wor&s;hip different from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church</Q> of England.

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.
That the afore&s;aid Conduct of the <HI>Society</HI> is not agreeable to the Letter or Spirit of their Charter.</HEAD>
<P>SUPPOSING the truth of the <HI>principal</HI> facts repre&s;ented in the foregoing &s;ections; particularly as to the &s;tate of religion in New-England, the number of mi&s;&s;ionaries, &amp;c. maintained here by the Society, and the places in which they are &s;upported; which I con&s;ider as the <HI>principal</HI> facts, even in di&s;tinction from the <HI>di&s;honourable manner</HI> in which epi&s;copal par|ties have often aro&s;e, been encouraged and in|crea&s;ed here; (which is con&s;idered only as an in|cidental circum&s;tance, not a principal fact, upon which the argument finally turns) Suppo&s;ing the truth of tho&s;e facts, I &s;ay, almo&s;t any unpreju|diced per&s;on may ea&s;ily &s;ee, that &s;uch a conduct in the Society is not conformable to their char|ter in any one material circum&s;tance, but e&s;&s;en|tially repugnant thereto. The contra&s;t, or the op|po&s;ition betwixt the charter and &s;uch a conduct, may be made to appear in a very few words.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is allowed on all hands, that one mate|rial end of this in&s;titution, according to the charter, was, <HI>propagating the go&s;pel</HI> among the <HI>heathen</HI> bordering on the Briti&s;h plantations. But no one will pretend to &s;ay, that the mi&s;&s;iona|ries in New-England are employed directly in <HI>that good work.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="66" REF="009441_0064_0F748DAA2BD0CC00">2. ANOTHER end was, the maintaining a public wor&s;hip in tho&s;e colonies, where the people, tho' called Chri&s;tians, were <Q><HI>wholly</HI> de&s;titute and unprovided,</Q>&mdash;where they <Q>wanted the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments, and &s;eemed to be abandoned to <HI>athei&s;m</HI> and infidelity,</Q> &amp;c. But, that this neither is, nor ever was, the true &s;tate of New-England, at lea&s;t not of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut, is &s;ufficiently apparent.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER end of the in&s;titution, which is indeed the fir&s;t mentioned in the charter, was, the benefit and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e plantations, in which, tho' there were &s;uch mini&s;ters as are de&s;igned in the charter, yet there was not a tolerable or competent provi&s;ion made for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; or, in the words of the charter, in which the provi&s;ion made for them was "very mean." Whereas it is a known fact, that in mo&s;t of tho&s;e places in New-England where the &s;o|ciety &s;upport mi&s;&s;ions, there was a legal and competent provi&s;ion before made for the &s;upport of an "able, learned, orthodox mini&s;try."</P>
<P N="4">4. THESE three are the <HI>only</HI> ends of the in&s;ti|tution expre&s;ly mentioned in, or that can fairly be inferred from the charter of the Society. And con&s;equently, if they have annually expended a large &s;um here in New-England, not conforma|bly to either of them, this mu&s;t needs be a mi&s;|application. Whatever they have expended, more or le&s;s, to accompli&s;h ends different from the&s;e, or &s;uch as are not directly &s;ub&s;ervient to them, has been laid out in a manner not warranted
<PB N="67" REF="009441_0065_0F748DAACC1BD698">by the charter; and therefore perverted and alienated from the true, important ends of their in&s;titution. Let the knowing and impartial judge, whether this conclu&s;ion is fairly drawn or not, &s;uppo&s;ing the truth of the facts afore&s;aid; which are indeed too notorious to admit of a denial.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX.
Of Objections again&s;t the Rea&s;oning in the preceeding Sections; and particularly as to a <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>orthodox</HI> Mini&s;try.</HEAD>
<P>IF the facts afore&s;aid are allowed, no <HI>&s;olid objection,</HI> it is conceived, can be brought again&s;t the general conclu&s;ion as to the perver&s;ion or mi&s;application of the Society's charity; tho' a per&s;on who &s;ets him&s;elf to invent <HI>eva&s;ions,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly think of a number of <HI>weak</HI> ones. And the ingenious Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> has been &s;o lucky as to hit upon &s;everal &s;uch in his <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> de&s;igned to vindicate the Society again&s;t that charge, which has often been brought again&s;t their conduct in re&s;pect of New-England. One of the&s;e eva&s;ions has al|ready been hinted at: But it may be proper to &s;peak of it a little more di&s;tinctly, tho' briefly, here&mdash;It is &s;aid, the mini&s;ters &s;poken of in the charter, are &s;poken of under the de&s;ignation of "learned and orthodox."</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="009441_0066_0F748DAB8C6D32B8">NOW, as to <HI>learning</HI>; tho' the mini&s;ters edu|cated in our young, but growing Colleges in New-England, may not vie with this gentleman, who brought with him the <HI>advantageous</HI> repu|tation of a con&s;iderable Scholar from one of the ancient and renowned Briti&s;h Univer&s;ities, in which, it is &s;aid, he reaped &s;ome laurels;&mdash;a re|putation which he doubtle&s;s merited; yet, as the truly knowing and learned, are generally <HI>candid</HI> al&s;o, it is hoped that he will not ab&s;o|lutely deny <HI>that qualification</HI> to our clergy, in the degree nece&s;&s;ary to render them u&s;eful and &s;ufficient mini&s;ters, provided they are not defec|tive in the other material point, <HI>orthodoxy.</HI> And, to do the gentleman ju&s;tice, he &s;eems wholly to wave the former, and to deny our clergy <HI>nothing but orthodoxy</HI>; in which, other people generally &s;uppo&s;e, they are not deficient. After mention|ing it as the primary de&s;ign of the in&s;titution a|fore&s;aid, to <Q>provide a maintenance for an or|thodox clergy;</Q> he &s;ubjoins, <Q>which (as the charter was obtained by the members of the church of England) mu&s;t, in all rea&s;onable con&s;truction, mean a clergy of their own church.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;id.</HI> p. 11.</NOTE> So that, there being no &s;uch mini&s;ters among&s;t <HI>Us,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of the charter, it was incumbent upon the Society to &s;upply Bo&s;ton, Cambridge, &amp;c. &amp;c. with <HI>orthodox</HI> mi&s;&s;ionaries: in doing which, they conform to the original and <HI>charitable</HI> de&s;ign of their in&s;titution. This is the obvious intent of what the gentleman &s;ays upon this head; tho', for certain prudential rea|&s;ons, he did not chu&s;e, in a more explicit man|ner,
<PB N="69" REF="009441_0067_0F748DAC48A06790">to monopolize <HI>all the orthodoxy</HI> in New-England to him&s;elf, the other mi&s;&s;ionaries, and the people of the church of England; &s;tigma|tizing all our mini&s;ters and churches as <HI>heretical</HI> or <HI>unorthodox.</HI> This is indeed the unavoidable con&s;equence of his appropriating and confining the terms <HI>orthodox mini&s;ters,</HI> to tho&s;e of the epi&s;copal communion. But, to have reproached us thus in plain words, might have been a <HI>bolder</HI> &s;troke than the <HI>times</HI> would well bear as yet; and &s;o, rather prejudiced than &s;erved the cau&s;e in which he engaged. This might perhaps have contributed to fru&s;trate the mode&s;t hopes which he expre&s;&s;ed of great acce&s;&s;ions to the epi&s;copal party at Cambridge, in his letter to the Society &s;oon after his mi&s;&s;ion there, dated Aug. 30. 1760. &s;ome time before the church was <Q>fit for di|vine &s;ervice.</Q> For it is &s;aid in the <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> printed in 1761, that Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> had written, that the <Q>building of the church was in &s;uch forwardne&s;s, that he hoped it would be fit for divine &s;ervice in <HI>November</HI>; and particular care had been taken to make the &s;tructure u&s;e|ful and durable, as well as decently elegant; and, in ca&s;e of <HI>future acce&s;&s;ions</HI> to the congre|gation, it might be <HI>ea&s;ily enlarged</HI>; and he had the &s;atisfaction to add, that it <HI>already pro|mi&s;ed</HI> to be one of the <HI>be&s;t &s;upported,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t flouri&s;hing churches in</HI> America.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ab&s;tract,</HI> 1761. p. 44, 45.</NOTE> It would doubtle&s;s be a great pity that the gentle|man's wi&s;hes and expectations &s;hould prove abortive, if there is no <HI>orthodox</HI> mini&s;ter in Cambridge be&s;ides him&s;elf, tho' there are three
<PB N="70" REF="009441_0068_0F748DACFB76FDF0">of our congregational churches, as well as the College, in that town.</P>
<P>BUT the following con&s;iderations, &s;ome of which were before hinted at, (p. 21) will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew that our mini&s;ters are not de&s;titute of <HI>orthodoxy,</HI> altho' they are not con|formi&s;ts to the church of England; and that the gentleman is a little too &s;elfi&s;h, in endeavouring to engro&s;s the whole of that precious <HI>commodity</HI> to him&s;elf and his party. Tho' if <HI>orthodoxy</HI> has the property which an eminent divine of the church of England <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bp. HARE, <HI>Difficulties</HI> and <HI>Di&s;couragements,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> &s;arca&s;tically a&s;cribes to it,&mdash;that of "covering a multitude of &s;ins," I will not deny, but yet do not affirm, that they have rather more <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> for it than tho&s;e whom they would &s;trip of it, leaving them nothing <HI>better</HI> than <HI>charity</HI> to &s;upply its place&mdash;</P>
<P>ORTHODOXY, in the commonly-received &s;en&s;e of the word among&s;t prote&s;tants at lea&s;t, notwith&s;tanding its general etemology, relates particularly to doctrinal points, or articles of faith, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from opinions about the be&s;t modes of eccle&s;ia&s;tic polity, external or|der, rites and ceremonies. To the&s;e latter it has no reference in its mo&s;t common u&s;e. And it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a gentleman &s;o well &s;killed in Chri&s;tian philology as Mr. <HI>Ap|thorp,</HI> will di&s;pute this point.</P>
<P>FROM whence it follows, that mini&s;ters or churches differing widely in opinion about an hierarchy, di&s;cipline, and modes of wor&s;hip, may yet be equally orthodox; agreeing nearly in the &s;ame common faith re&s;pecting GOD, JESUS CHRIST, his offices and redemption.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="009441_0069_0F748DADC40B4740">IT is al&s;o a known fact, that the mini&s;ters and churches in New-England, with a very few ex|ceptions, if any, agree in doctrinal points, and therefore in re&s;pect of orthodoxy, with the church of England, according to her articles re|lative to the&s;e points.</P>
<P>IT is moreover known, or at lea&s;t generally &s;uppo&s;ed among&s;t us, that our New-England mi|ni&s;ters, a very few excepted, adhere much more clo&s;ely in their preaching, both to the letter and &s;pirit of tho&s;e doctrinal articles, than mo&s;t of the epi&s;copal clergy them&s;elves, whether here or in England. And if this be fact, as I am fully per&s;uaded it is, the former are really <HI>more</HI> or|thodox than the latter, even according to the ar|ticles of their own church. Be&s;ides:</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame rule that this gentleman and &s;ome others deny our mini&s;ters the title of or|thodox, limiting it to the "clergy of their own church;" they mu&s;t deny it to the mini&s;ters of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of Scotland, and of all other churches, except perhaps that of Rome. For none of them fully agree with the church of England, except in doctrinal points, as we al&s;o do; which, it &s;eems, is not &s;ufficient to de|nominate them orthodox. According to which pretence, there will be no orthodox mini&s;ters in the world, except of the church of England: And is not this very mode&s;t and candid!</P>
<P>DIVERS of <HI>our</HI> laws relative to mini&s;ters, and in which they are de&s;igned as orthodox, having had the allowance of the King, the head of the Engli&s;h church, this &s;eems to be a royal ac|knowledgment
<PB N="72" REF="009441_0070_0F748DAE8F7A91F8">of their orthodoxy. And is it not &s;omewhat pre&s;umptuous for any of the members of that body to contradict their head!</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING tho&s;e mini&s;ters and churches in England, with which ours in New-England very nearly agree in doctrine, di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip, have often been accu&s;ed by the epi&s;copalians as <HI>&s;chi&s;matical,</HI> on account of their di&s;&s;ent from the church there e&s;tabli&s;hed; yet they have not often been reproached as hetero|dox, heretical or un-orthodox in that re&s;pect. So far from it, that I do not think there can be a &s;ingle epi&s;copal divine of reputation produced, or other approved writer on that &s;ide within a century pa&s;t, who has taxed them in a body as heretics, or denied them to be orthodox, on account of their non-conformity. Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;eems to have forgotten that the epi&s;copal di|vines in England, even in their highe&s;t flights, have generally di&s;tingui&s;hed betwixt heterodoxy and &s;chi&s;m; while he, it &s;eems, is for con|founding them together, and will not allow us to be orthodox even in New-England, unle&s;s we will become conformi&s;ts to a church that is not e&s;tabli&s;hed here.</P>
<P>IT has before been ob&s;erved, how unnatural it is to &s;uppo&s;e that King WILLIAM de&s;igned to limit the terms "orthodox mini&s;ters" in the charter, to tho&s;e of the church of England; and thereby to brand the mini&s;ters of all other prote&s;tant churches as heterodox; which were to &s;uppo&s;e that catholic-&s;pirited Prince as great a bigot as any of his royal predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="009441_0071_0F748DAF95E122A0">BESIDES: The whole air and complexion of the charter are catholic in the highe&s;t degree: There is no hint or allu&s;ion therein as to any differences among&s;t prote&s;tants. The grand end propo&s;ed therein, is propagating the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> the principles of <HI>true religion,</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian religion,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to <HI>athei&s;m, infidelity</HI> and <HI>popery</HI>: And orthodox mini&s;ters &s;tand there in direct oppo&s;ition to popi&s;h prie&s;ts and je&s;uits; as before ob&s;erved. It is therefore contrary to all the rules of good critici&s;m, as well as to catholic chri&s;tianity, to appropriate and confine the&s;e terms to the mini&s;ters of the church of England, and thereby to hereticate the mini&s;ters of all other prote&s;tant churches. Nothing can be le&s;s conformable to the language, and whole &s;pirit of the charter.</P>
<P>IF this argument of Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> were of any force, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ee why the Society might not &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries into Scotland to convert the kirk to epi&s;copacy, by virtue of their charter, as well as into New-England, to convert us; excepting only that Scotland is not a "plantation, colony or factory beyond &s;eas;" and, in that re&s;pect, certainly not within the de&s;ign of the charter.</P>
<P>THIS point may be now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with re|minding the reader of the reply of Mr. HOBART to &s;ome of his antagoni&s;ts, relative thereto. "If," &s;aid he, <Q>they think that none but the clergy of the church of England are in a legal &s;en&s;e <HI>orthodox</HI> mini&s;ters, Dr. MACSPARRAN can inform them how that matter was deter|mined

This great Prelate, a di&s;tingui&s;hed member of the Society, is one of the two witne&s;&s;es whom Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;ummons to bear "te&s;timony" in favor of the Society, after producing that of

The te&s;timony of the worthy Bi&s;hop BERKLEY has already been taken notice of. The other of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es is quoted by Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> as having given an an&s;wer &s;imilar to his own, to the objection afore&s;aid, in the fol|lowing words&mdash;<Q>An objection to the conduct of the Society, is that they have &s;ent mi&s;&s;iona|ries to &s;ome places in which there were alrea|dy Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;emblies e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;up|ported. But in the <HI>le&s;t</HI> exceptionable of <HI>the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> there are &s;everal things, which the <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of many (we apprehend, with great rea&s;on) cannot acquie&s;ce in; who were not therefore to be left de&s;titute of public wor&s;hip; e&s;pecially as our charter was granted in expre&s;s terms, <HI>for the maintenance of an</HI> orthodox <HI>clergy in tho&s;e parts.</HI></Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;id.</HI> p. 21</NOTE> So that, it &s;eems, one material point which his GRACE is called to bear te&s;timony to, is, that the <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of ma|ny people in the&s;e parts, cannot <HI>acquie&s;ce</HI> in &s;e|veral things found even in <HI>the lea&s;t exceptionable of our Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> &amp;c. Let me make a few remarks upon the foregoing pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> thus &s;upported by the <HI>te&s;timony</HI> of this great Prelate. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. MR. <HI>Apthorp</HI> plainly allows that the peo|ple in &s;ome of the colonies have the means of religion already, without the Society's charity,
<PB N="77" REF="009441_0075_0F748DB35F0E93A8"><HI>in other prote&s;tant communions</HI>; by &s;aying that <HI>this is not univer&s;ally true; or wherever it hap|pily is true,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF this is <HI>happily true</HI> in any of the Ame|rican colonies, I conclude he will allow it to be &s;o in this province and in Connecticut, which have much the faire&s;t preten&s;ions to &s;uch a preeminence; and to the proceedings of the Socie|ty in which, the objection principally relates. It is therefore conceived, that it may be natu|rally taken as a conce&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> that in the&s;e principal parts of New-England, where &s;o many epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ions have been &s;upported by the Society, the inhabitants had the means of religion already, <HI>in other prote&s;tant communions.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THEREFORE, according to the rea&s;oning in the preceeding &s;ections, which needs not to be here repeated, the&s;e are not <HI>&s;uch</HI> colonies as were the proper objects of that charity: For their &s;tate in re&s;pect of religion, is e&s;&s;entially dif|ferent from that of the places de&s;cribed in the charter; and for which a charitable provi&s;ion was made thereby. So that the money expended here by the Society as afore&s;aid, is not employ|ed in conformity to the true intent of the char|ter: For who can, with the lea&s;t appearance of rea&s;on, &s;ay, that the charter makes provi&s;ion for tho&s;e plantations, in which the people enjoyed the means of religion already, in ANY <HI>prote&s;tant communion</HI>?&mdash;tho&s;e in which a &s;ufficient num|ber of prote&s;tant mini&s;ters of ANY denomination were competently provided for, and God's pub|lic wor&s;hip was con&s;tantly upheld?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="78" REF="009441_0076_0F748DB3D3AA5128">4. As to the plea of <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> that there are &s;ome per&s;ons among&s;t us, who cannot u&s;e the means of religion, which they have in our <HI>pro|te&s;tant communions</HI>; and that to &s;uch per&s;ons the&s;e are NO MEANS, any more than Popery or Mahometani&s;m, &amp;c: If the&s;e very con&s;cientious people were as entirely prote&s;tant in their &s;enti|ments, as our communions are in their nature, it might perhaps in part remove the difficulty. What there is in the lea&s;t exceptionable of our truly Chri&s;tian and prote&s;tant a&s;&s;emblies, which &s;hould give offence to the con&s;ciences of &s;incere, good prote&s;tants, neither Mr. <HI>Ap|thorp</HI> nor his GRACE has particularly declared: Whether it be the preaching, &s;o &s;trictly agreea|ble in general to the doctrinal articles of the church of England; or the devout prayers, not read to GOD, but dictated by the heart, as in the truly primitive and apo&s;tolic churches; or the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments in the molt &s;imple and &s;criptural manner, without any of tho&s;e additions which the wi&s;dom or the clergy afterwards invented; or whether it be any thing el&s;e, we are left to conjecture; and &s;o cannot particularly an&s;wer this objection again&s;t our <HI>prote&s;tant communions,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;|tian a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> as his GRACE is plea&s;ed to call them. It &s;eems they both decline giving the&s;e the name of <HI>churches</HI>: But for what rea&s;on, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay. It is to be hoped, they can form &s;ome idea of a truly chri&s;tian and prote&s;tant church, without a King or Queen at its head; without numerous acts of parliament to model
<PB N="79" REF="009441_0077_0F748DB4767D2090">its con&s;titution, and e&s;tabli&s;h its ceremonials; without printed forms of devotion; and with|out an hierarchy re&s;embling that of the Romi&s;h church, in which <HI>one</HI> great Prelate <HI>pre&s;ides</HI> over the whole, with all the inferior religious orders, the lowe&s;t of which are as it were trodden in the dirt;&mdash;an hierarchy which, in a word, may be compared to JACOB's ladder,
<Q>"Its foot on earth, its top above the &s;kies."</Q></P>
<P>IF there are any per&s;ons among&s;t us, who have no conceptions of a truly Chri&s;tian church, but in connexion with &s;uch things as the&s;e, it is not indeed &s;trange that the means of public religion which they might have in our <HI>prote&s;tant communions,</HI> &s;hould be NO MEANS to them; or that their con&s;ciences &s;hould not fully <HI>acquie&s;ce</HI> in them; not even &s;o readily as they might in <HI>Popery.</HI> Indeed I have my&s;elf heard &s;ome epi&s;|copalians among&s;t us, who were reckoned very good church-men, &s;ay, that they &s;hould much prefer the <HI>communion</HI> of the church of Rome to ours; and would &s;ooner go to ma&s;s than come to our a&s;&s;embles, if there were here any Romi&s;h, and no Engli&s;h churches. This I declare, of my own certain knowledge, and could mention names; and I have divers times heard credible per&s;ons &s;peak of &s;ome <HI>con&s;cientious</HI> epi&s;copalians among&s;t us, as expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves after the &s;ame manner: Tho', to do them ju&s;tice, I do not &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e &s;entiments generally pre|vail among&s;t them. Some of them may <HI>po&s;&s;ibly,</HI> without going the&s;e lengths, have con&s;cientious &s;cruples about the means of religion in our <HI>pro|te&s;tant
<PB N="80" REF="009441_0078_0F748DB540803C20">communions</HI>: But to &s;ay, that becau&s;e there are &s;ome things or circum&s;tances attending them, which they cannot intirely <HI>acquie&s;ce</HI> in, or <HI>approve</HI> of, therefore they are ab&s;olutely NO MEANS at all to them, is at be&s;t a very ex|traordinary po&s;ition. However,</P>
<P N="5">5. IT is readily granted, that great allowan|ces ought to be made for <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>&s;crupulous, tender,</HI> and even <HI>erroneous</HI> con&s;ciences; and for the prejudices of education, in matters merely of a religious nature. And this plea of con&s;cience ought to be allowed valid thus far, <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e con&s;cientious people among us, &s;hould not be <HI>compelled</HI> to join in our <HI>prote&s;tant communion</HI>; but left intirely at liberty to wor&s;hip GOD ac|cording to the epi&s;copal mode, even tho' we may think it con&s;iderably le&s;s prote&s;tant and &s;criptural than our own. Indeed there are not a few of them, whom we &s;hould be far from <HI>de&s;iring</HI> to &s;ee coming to <HI>our communion,</HI> unle&s;s they were much more <HI>con&s;cientious</HI> in &s;ome other re&s;pects, than they appear to be&mdash; The government here neither pretends nor de&s;ires to deprive them of their religious liberty: Tho', by the way, had the government in England allowed our Fore-fathers the like liberty of con&s;cience, they would have had no occa&s;ion to take refuge in New-England, from their &s;ufferings for non-conformity. BUT,</P>
<P N="6">6. HOW good a plea &s;oever this of con|&s;cience may be for liberty, in oppo&s;ition to all <HI>re&s;traint</HI> or <HI>con&s;traint</HI> in matters purely religious; yet it &s;eems far from a &s;olid one as u&s;ed by his
<PB N="81" REF="009441_0079_0F748DB5F91D4EB0"><HI>Grace the Arch-bishop of Canterbury,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> in order to ju&s;tify the Society in the application of &s;o much of their money, or even any part of it, for the &s;upport and increa&s;e of the epi&s;copal party among us. The rea&s;on is obvious from what has been &s;aid before: Their whole fund and revenue are <HI>otherwi&s;e appropri|ated</HI> by their charter it&s;elf; <HI>viz.</HI> to the propa|gating the go&s;pel among the heathen, and to the maintenance of God's public wor&s;hip in tho&s;e plantations, in which no competent provi&s;ion was before made for mini&s;ters; and in which the people, for want of the means of religion in any prote&s;tant cammunion, &s;eem'd abandoned to athei&s;m and infidelity, or in imminent danger of being perverted to popery. To alienate their revenue from <HI>the&s;e</HI> important ends, under a pre|tence of gratifying &s;ome <HI>&s;crupulous con&s;ciences,</HI> in places where a legal and competent provi&s;ion was before made for the maintenance of mini|&s;ters, and a public, prote&s;tant religion; is a mani|fe&s;t abu&s;e and perver&s;ion of that charity, even upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the&s;e con&s;cientious people among us were much to be pitied, and really the objects of charity. If any per&s;ons in Eng|land, in their private capacity, &s;hould think it a deed of charity to advance money for &s;upport|ing epi&s;copal churches here, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e comparatively few <HI>con&s;cientious</HI> people, to whom the means of religion which are to be had in our prote&s;tant communions, are NO MEANS at all, any more than Popery or Mahometani&s;m;
<PB N="82" REF="009441_0080_0F748DB6B8F36C08">they have an undoubted right to do it. But the ca&s;e of the Society is e&s;&s;entially different in this re&s;pect, from that of private per&s;ons: They have not the &s;ame right to di&s;po&s;e of their mo|ney, that a private man has to di&s;po&s;e of his property; the former being particularly appro|priated to certain u&s;es and ends, from which it may not be alienated to any others, even tho' good in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THAT argument which Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> quotes from the great Prelate afore&s;aid;&mdash;that "the charter was granted in expre&s;s terms, for the maintenance of an <HI>orthodox</HI> clergy" in the colo|nies; cannot be thought one of his GRACE's "invincible rea&s;ons" which Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;peaks of, till it is proved that no clergymen be&s;ides tho&s;e of the church of England, can properly be called <HI>orthodox</HI> mini&s;ters, even tho' they ad|here to the doctrinal articles of that church more clo&s;ely than her own clergy. But enough of this before. And the intelligent reader is now left to judge, whether Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> had rea&s;on to u&s;her in his <HI>two witne&s;&s;es,</HI> as he does in the following words&mdash; <Q>To take leave of this po|pular objection with <HI>&s;o full a confutation,</HI> that it will be <HI>di&s;ingenuous</HI> ever to advance it again; the writer <HI>confidently re&s;ts his proof on the unexceptionable te&s;timony</HI></Q>, &amp;c. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> p. 18.</NOTE> That he does this <HI>confidently,</HI> no one will deny; but that the&s;e te&s;timonies are &s;o intirely <HI>unexceptionable</HI> in this cau&s;e, as to be a ju&s;t ground for &s;uch confidence,
<PB N="83" REF="009441_0081_0F748DB8C8EE58B0">is far le&s;s apparent;&mdash;e&s;pecially con&s;idered as te&s;timonies or the party <HI>accu&s;ed.</HI> But yet it is not ea&s;y to &s;ee, why he might not call in the Society as witne&s;&s;es in their own cau&s;e, with as much propriety at lea&s;t, as he had before &s;ubmit|ted his defence of them to their <HI>own judgment and deci&s;ion.</HI> One of the witne&s;&s;es, however, bi&s;hop BERKLEY, &s;ays nothing directly to the main point, as to the mi&s;&s;ions in tho&s;e colonies where|in prote&s;tant churches were <HI>before &s;ettled</HI>: The other, his GRACE of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> does; but yet perhaps not &s;o convincingly, as to render it quite <HI>di&s;ingenuous ever to advance this objection again.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2.

I might engage to bring twenty per&s;ons who think the religious &s;tate of the country wor&s;e than it was, and who attribute this in a great mea&s;ure to the <HI>&s;ame cau&s;e</HI> to which he a&s;cribes the reformation of it, for one that he can produce to &s;upport his double hypothe&s;is.

<P N="4">4.

To plead the good done in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, however undi&s;puted; tho' it may be con&s;idered as &s;ome apology for, yet it cannot be con&s;idered as a proper vindication of, tho&s;e who did it; e&s;pecially if it has occa&s;ioned the neglect of a much greater good to the heathens, or to tho&s;e colouies wherein no tolerable provi&s;ion was made for the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acraments. This plea is as invalid, as if, when a particular per&s;on is accu&s;ed of mi&s;apply|ing the money put into his hands expre&s;ly for the u&s;e of A, peri&s;hing with hunger and cold; it &s;hould be alleged in his vindication, that he had laid it out for the benefit of B; and fed and cloathed him <HI>more elegantly</HI> than he was cloathed and fed before.

Some farther reflections on the &s;ame Point, occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Con&s;iderations.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> de&s;cends to &s;ome parti|culars, in which he &s;uppo&s;es the &s;tate of re|ligion among us is greatly improved by the charitable care of the Society. "Every one," &s;ays he, <Q>who knows the hi&s;tory of this coun|try mu&s;t acknowledge, that the religious &s;tate of it is manife&s;tly improved: <HI>notwith&s;tanding the</HI> IMMORALITIES and defects which we lament, and wi&s;h to reform in the pre&s;ent MANNERS and principles. Religion no lon|ger wears among us that <HI>&s;avage</HI> and <HI>gloomy appearance,</HI> with which <HI>&s;uper&s;tition</HI> had terribly arrayed <HI>her: its</HI> &s;peculative doctrines are freed from tho&s;e <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s horrors</HI> with which <HI>fanati|ci&s;m</HI> had perverted them: <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> has worn off, in proportion as men have &s;een the <HI>beauty of holine&s;s</HI>: and above all, that exterminating mon&s;ter <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> is it&s;elf exterminated both from the temper and practice of the age. <HI>Much indeed remains to be done in</HI> MANNERS <HI>and</HI> PIETY,</Q> &amp;c <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> p. 17.</NOTE>. How greatly are we in|debted to the Society!</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="009441_0085_0F748DBCB44EBF40">BUT yet here &s;eems to be a conce&s;&s;ion, that the boa&s;ted reformation in the &s;tate of religion among us, very little, if at all con&s;i&s;ts in the improvement of our <HI>morals, manners,</HI> and <HI>piety.</HI> It is not pretended by Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> that there has been any con&s;iderable reformation in the&s;e re&s;pects, &s;ince the mi&s;&s;ions were fir&s;t appointed here, which is <HI>greatly the work of the Society.</HI></P>
<P>But</P>
<P>HE &s;ays, <HI>Religion no longer wears among us that &s;avage and gloomy appearance,</HI> &amp;c. And, not to di&s;pute with this ingenious gentleman about &s;mall matters, it &s;hall be allowed, (if that is what he means) that the <HI>faces</HI> of people in general are le&s;s <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>&s;olemn</HI> than they were a century ago, or even &s;ince the in&s;titution of the Society: And this <HI>improvement,</HI> it may al&s;o be conceded, is <HI>greatly the work of the Society,</HI> by the in&s;trumentality of tho&s;e good gentlemen the mi&s;&s;ionaries, who commonly appear with a pretty gray, debonair and jovial countenance. But it is not quite clear from hence, that <HI>the &s;tate of religion is now much &s;uperior to what it was before.</HI> If divers of our Forefathers had &s;omewhat <HI>too long</HI> faces, and a too &s;et, formal air; yet they might be very pious, virtuous and worthy men. And tho' I would by no means deny the venerable Society or their mi&s;&s;ionaries any prai&s;e which may ju&s;tly belong to them for contributing to the mirth, gaiety and chearfulne&s;s of our countenances; yet methinks the gentle|man went a little two far in u&s;ing the expre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="88" REF="009441_0086_0F748DBCC35028E8">SAVAGE <HI>and gloomy appearance</HI>; partly (unle&s;s I mi&s;take his meaning) to expre&s;s his di&s;like to the <HI>faces</HI> of our good Fathers, &s;ome of who&s;e pictures he may probably have &s;een. And it may per|haps be worthy of his con&s;ideration, whether this di&s;like might not in part be owing to the un&s;kil|fulne&s;s of the <HI>painters</HI> of tho&s;e days. But be that as it may, it might &s;till be worthy of his con&s;ideration, whether, &s;ince the mi&s;&s;ionaries came among us, many people are not run into an extreme quite oppo&s;ite to gloomine&s;s and preci&s;ene&s;s, and even to that gravity and &s;obriety which become the Chri&s;tian character; putting on a light, thoughtle&s;s air and behaviour. He will not deny but that people may riot, laugh and frolick, cur&s;e, &s;wear and game too much, as well as wear too grave and formal a countenance. Tho&s;e are much wor&s;e, and more dangerous ex|tremes than this. And many per&s;ons that were men before either of <HI>us</HI> was born, can atte&s;t that &s;uch exce&s;&s;es are, beyond all compari&s;on, more frequent &s;ince the church of England pre|vailed here, than they were before; and have in|crea&s;ed in &s;ome proportion to its flourishing. But, what the true cau&s;e hereof is, &s;uppo&s;ing the fact, is another point: And, for my own part, I will not affirm that this is <HI>greatly the work of the Society.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the gentleman intimates, that the &s;tate of religion is much improved among us, in re&s;pect of its &s;peculative doctrines, how little &s;oever it may be in re&s;pect of <HI>manners</HI> and <HI>piety&mdash; Its
<PB N="89" REF="009441_0087_0F748DBD90741110">&s;peculative doctrines,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are freed from tho&s;e &s;en&s;ele&s;s horrors with which fanatici&s;m had perverted them.</HI> Let it be here ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;eems not only too har&s;h, but a little impolitic in giving &s;uch an account of our Forefathers. He had ju&s;t be|fore &s;poken of religion among them, as having been <HI>terribly arrayed by &s;uper&s;tition.</HI> And here they are repre&s;ented as a parcel of wretched <HI>Fanatics,</HI> who had perverted the &s;peculative doctrines of religion with <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s horrors.</HI> Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> in his <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> (p. 23.) expre&s;&s;es great indignation at the author of a &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;ult on the memory of a decea&s;ed mi&s;|&s;ionary; which was yet, perhaps, no in&s;ult. But who&s;e memory does this &s;ame gentleman now in&s;ult in &s;o licentious a manner? In ef|fect, the memory of all the pious Fathers of New-England, &s;o ju&s;tly venerable and dear to their po&s;terity, who&s;e faith is in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame with their's to this day. So that he does, in a &s;ort, in&s;ult the living and the dead at the &s;ame time; and not a few particular per|&s;ons only, but the people of a country in ge|neral. This, to be &s;ure, does not &s;eem the likelie&s;t way to make pro&s;elytes to the church&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS outrage is the more to be wonde|red at, becau&s;e the gentleman does, by natu|ral implication, in&s;ult the Fathers and Foun|ders of his own church at the &s;ame time. For it is a known fact, that the <HI>&s;peculative doctrines</HI> almo&s;t univer&s;ally received and pro|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="90" REF="009441_0088_0F748DBE365E9058">in New-England from fir&s;t to la&s;t, are in effect the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the church of Eng|land according to her articles. I &s;uppo&s;e, with others, that the gentleman had here a more particular view to the Calvini&s;tic doctrines of original &s;in, ju&s;tification by faith alone, elec|tion and reprobation. In this &s;entiment I am confirmed by a pa&s;&s;age in a &s;ermon of Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> publi&s;hed a year or two &s;ince; where|in he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with &s;o much contempt and horror of tho&s;e, who <Q>draw portraits of the DEITY from the &s;anguinary pa&s;&s;ions of the wor&s;t men&mdash;repre&s;enting the all-mer|ciful Father as the tyrant of the univer&s;e, reprobating his creatures, pre-determining their crimes, and prede&s;tinating their eter|nal mi&s;ery:</Q> of per&s;ons who fal&s;ely charge on Chri&s;tianity opinions <Q>&s;ubver&s;ive of all moral obligation, leading weak minds into enthu&s;ia&s;m and licentiou&s;ne&s;s</Q>&mdash;of per&s;ons by whom <Q>a ju&s;t attention to the cau&s;e of virtue is reproached as derogating from the glories of HIM, <HI>who hath &s;anctified us with His blood</HI>; and the ju&s;tification of &s;inners&mdash; is propo&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, as to render virtue u&s;ele&s;s and even a crime:&mdash;the&s;e hor|rors,</Q> &amp;c. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Con&s;titution of a Chri&s;tian Church,</HI> &amp;c. p. 8. Preached at the Con&s;ecration of the new Church in Cambridge.</NOTE> I believe hardly any one who reads this pa&s;&s;age, will doubt but that the Cal|vini&s;tic doctrines afore&s;aid, are tho&s;e to which Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> refers in his <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> as the <HI>&s;peculative doctrines</HI> of our <HI>&s;uper&s;titious, fanatical</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="009441_0089_0F748DBEF80EA988">Forefathers; the effects of which are &s;uppo|&s;ed to have been, the making them <HI>&s;avage</HI> and <HI>gloomy,</HI> and filling them with <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s horrors.</HI> I would not be over confident; but yet take this to have been his true meaning. And, what the church of England profe&s;&s;es in her arti|cles re&s;pecting tho&s;e doctrines, the reader may be plea&s;ed to &s;ee in the margin, where the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;everal articles is quoted: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>ARTICLE IX. <HI>Of original or Birth-Sin.</HI> Original &s;in &s;tandeth not in the following of <HI>Adam</HI> (as the Pelagians do vainly talk) but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man&mdash;and therefore in every per&s;on that is born into this world, <HI>it de&s;erveth God's wrath and damnation</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>ARTICLE XI. <HI>Of the Ju&s;tification of Man.</HI> We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t by <HI>faith,</HI> and not for our <HI>works</HI> or <HI>de&s;ervings</HI>&mdash;</P>

<P>ARTICLE XVII. <HI>Of Prede&s;tination and Election.</HI> Prede&s;tination to life is the everla&s;ting purpo&s;e of God, whereby (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath con&s;tantly decreed by his coun&s;el, &s;ecret to us, to deliver from cur&s;e and damnation, <HI>tho&s;e whom he hath cho&s;en in Chri&s;t out of mankind,</HI> to bring them by Chri&s;t to everla&s;ting &s;alvation, as ve&s;&s;els made to honor.&mdash;As the godly con&s;ideration of prede&s;tination, and our elec|tion in Chri&s;t, is full of &s;weet, plea&s;ant, and un&s;peakable comfort to godly per&s;ons:&mdash;So for curious and carnal per|&s;ons, lacking the Spirit of Chri&s;t, <HI>to have continually be|fore their eyes the &s;entence of God's prede&s;tination,</HI> is a <HI>mo&s;t dangerous downfal,</HI> whereby the Devil doth thru&s;t them either into <HI>de&s;paration,</HI> or into wretchle&s;ne&s;s of mo&s;t <HI>un|clean living,</HI> no le&s;s perilous than <HI>de&s;paration.</HI></P></Q></NOTE>
<PB N="92" REF="009441_0090_0F748DBFC32D3B80">Whereby one may be the better able to judge of Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s &s;incerity and con&s;i&s;|tency in &s;ub&s;cribing tho&s;e articles as part of his faith; tho' it is indeed po&s;&s;ible that he has altered his opinion &s;ince, as a very hone&s;t man might do. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. TO &s;peak &s;incerely, I own it is my <HI>pri|vate</HI> opinion, that it has been too common a thing for people in New-England to expre&s;s them&s;elves in a manner ju&s;tly exceptionable upon the&s;e points, however agreeably both to the letter and &s;pirit of the articles afore&s;aid: But yet, I believe, not more exceptionably than many eminent divines of the Church of England did in the la&s;t century.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is probably true, that for half a cen|tury pa&s;t, many mini&s;ters and others in New-England have di&s;cour&s;ed more cautiou&s;ly upon tho&s;e points than the greater part did before; and &s;ome perhaps have run into an oppo&s;ite extreme: Which may be owing to the preva|lence of the church of England among&s;t us; many of who&s;e mini&s;ters, if not the mo&s;t, have long preached in a &s;train almo&s;t diametrically oppo&s;ite to the articles afore&s;aid. But upon &s;uppo&s;ition that we are really indebted to the Society or their mi&s;&s;ionaries in any degree, for freeing the &s;peculative doctrines of religion a|mong&s;t us, from what Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> calls <HI>&s;en&s;e|le&s;s horrors</HI>; (which will not be generally al|lowed) yet we may well think it ungenerous and incon&s;i&s;tent in this gentleman, to revile
<PB N="93" REF="009441_0091_0F748DC076E60038">our Forefathers as a company of &s;uper&s;titious, &s;en&s;ele&s;s Fanatics, for adhering &s;o clo&s;ely as they did to the doctrinal articles of the church of England.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Apthorp</HI> adds, as another particular of our reformation, which is greatly the work of the Society, that <HI>hypocri&s;y has worn off in pro|portion as men have &s;een the beauty of holine&s;s.</HI> As to which it may be ob&s;erved, that we have not more clearly &s;een the <HI>beauty of holine&s;s</HI> &s;ince the prevalence of the church of England a|mong&s;t us, than it was di&s;cerned before, ex|cept perhaps by way of <HI>contra&s;t.</HI> He does not pretend to &s;ay, that the &s;tate of religion has been improved here, &s;ince the mi&s;&s;ions, in re|&s;pect of <HI>morals, manners</HI> or <HI>piety.</HI> So that the <HI>holine&s;s</HI> which he &s;peaks of, &s;eems to be &s;ome|thing di&s;tinct from the&s;e; and what &s;ort of holine&s;s that is, I will not pretend to conjec|ture. But whereas he &s;uppo&s;es that <HI>hypocri&s;y has worn off</HI> in proportion to the glorious di&s;|covery of it in the church of England; I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the mo&s;t dete&s;table hypocri&s;y in the &s;ight of God and wi&s;e men, is that which is &s;hewn in a zeal for rites and ceremo|nies, for external modes and forms; e&s;pecially unin&s;tituted ones, the inventions of men, while the zealots are comparatively negligent of the weightier matters of the law and go&s;pel. Of which kind of hypocri&s;y there has unque&s;tion|ably been much more among&s;t us, &s;ince the Society was in&s;tituted than before. But, to
<PB N="94" REF="009441_0092_0F748DC2358D84B8">what this is to be a&s;cribed, is another que&s;tion: I will not &s;ay, it is <HI>greatly the work of the Society.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;ubjoins: <HI>And above all, that exterminating mon&s;ter</HI> per&s;ecution, <HI>is it&s;elf ex|terminated both from the temper and practice of the pre&s;ent age.</HI> This he mentions as another in&s;tance in which the &s;tate of religion is ma|nife&s;tly improved among us, by means of the Society and the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ions. And any one, ignorant of the country, would from hence naturally conclude, that there had been here <HI>acts of uniformity</HI> in wor&s;hip, rigorou&s;ly put in execution, till the e&s;tabli&s;hment of epi&s;|copal churches in the&s;e parts: For otherwi&s;e this is not &s;o pertinently &s;aid, as might be ex|pected from &s;o ingenious a gentleman. But this is a mi&s;take at be&s;t: No &s;uch acts ever took place here, &s;o far as I have learnt. But if there were, in the early days of the country, &s;ome in&s;tances of unju&s;tifiable &s;everity to|wards the Quakers, &amp;c. they were u&s;ed much le&s;s under the notion of the&s;e people being di&s;|&s;enters from our mode of wor&s;hip, than of their being di&s;turbers of the peace, and of our religious a&s;&s;emblies; in which re&s;pects they were indeed very di&s;orderly, abu&s;ive, and highly culpable. Some learned and good men in England, who had not a thorough under&s;tanding of the ca&s;e, have, for this rea|&s;on, pa&s;&s;ed much too har&s;h a judgment on the conduct of our Forefathers; tho' I will not undertake to vindicate all their conduct
<PB N="95" REF="009441_0093_0F748DC3110B2CA8">relative to this point. But &s;uppo&s;ing them to have been ju&s;tly chargeable with &s;ome in&s;tan|ces of per&s;ecution; from whom? &mdash; from what church did they learn this practice? E|pi&s;copalians, certainly, &s;hould lay their hands upon their mouths&mdash;</P>
<P>MOREOVER: How blameable &s;oever our Forefathers might have been in this re&s;pect; yet how does it appear that our reformation therein, is <HI>greatly the work of the Society</HI>? No|thing of that kind had been known among&s;t us for many years before the Society had any mi&s;&s;ionaries among us, or was it&s;elf in being. Nor is it a little odd that this gentleman &s;hould in&s;inuate, that the po&s;terity of tho&s;e who &s;o cruelly per&s;ecuted our Fathers out of England into America, &s;hould follow us hither to teach us charity and moderation, and to extermi|nate the <HI>exterminating mon&s;ter per&s;ecution</HI> from among us! Is he in je&s;t or in earne&s;t? &mdash; Wherever we learnt Chri&s;tian forbearance and charity towards tho&s;e that differ from us, he may be a&s;&s;ured we did not learn it of the church of England; from which our beloved and honoured brethren in England, even at this day, do not in all re&s;pects find the kinde&s;t u&s;age; being &s;ubjected to divers temporal in|conveniences on account of their non-confor|mity. And notwith&s;tanding the gentleman &s;ays, per&s;ecution is exterminated both from the temper and practice of the pre&s;ent age; I have my&s;elf heard &s;ome of the epi&s;copalians a+mong&s;t
<PB N="96" REF="009441_0094_0F748DC385A44278">us &s;peak with much regret, and even indignation, of the <HI>act of toleration,</HI> by which that of <HI>uniformity</HI> was in part repealed. Nay, it is credibly reported, that &s;ome of the warm epi&s;copalians here, have &s;aid, <HI>they hoped for the time when they might &s;hoot</HI> di&s;&s;enters <HI>as freely as they might &s;hoot pigeons.</HI> Not a few of them di&s;cover a like &s;pirit. Let the reader then judge, whether the exterminating mon|&s;ter is intirely exterminated; and if &s;o, how <HI>greatly this is the work of the Society</HI> and their mi&s;&s;ionaries.</P>
<P>IT does not appear, upon the whole, that we are at all indebted to the Society for the improvement of the &s;tate of religion among&s;t us, in any of the in&s;tances which this gentle|man mentions: It is probably in &s;ome re&s;pects, particularly as to our <HI>morals,</HI> wor&s;e than if there had never been an epi&s;copal church in the&s;e parts. But upon &s;uppo&s;ition that what Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;ays as to this matter, was true in fact; &s;till it mu&s;t be remembered, that this is no ju&s;tification of the Society in alienating their fund and revenues from their direct, pro|per ends expre&s;&s;ed in the charter.</P>

<P>DR. BEARCROFT, who has many years been Secretary to the Society, near the beginning of his &s;ermon before it, &s;pea|king of the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in a very rhetorical &s;tile about the great <Q>charity of bringing back their brethren in America to good manners and a chri&s;tian life.</Q> And had he &s;poken only of profe&s;&s;ed epi&s;copalians, or of people in &s;uch an hea|theni&s;h &s;tate as tho&s;e in &s;ome of the colonies, no one would have doubted the charitablene&s;s of &s;uch a de&s;ign. But to me it is evident that he comprehends us Congregationali&s;ts and Pre&s;byterians in New-England, in the terms <HI>brethren in America.</HI> Taking this for granted,
<PB N="98" REF="009441_0096_0F748DC5CF300020">it may be ob&s;erved, that how much &s;oever we may be obliged to him for his catholici&s;m in acknowledging us for his brethren, notwith|&s;tanding our apo&s;tacy from epi&s;copacy; yet we are not much obliged to him for the in&s;i|nuation, that we are &s;adly departed from good manners and a chri&s;tian life; &s;o that the de|&s;ign of the Society <HI>to bring us back</HI> thereto, is produced as an argument of their prodigious charity. And if by thus bringing us back, he really intended any thing more than conver|ting us to epi&s;copacy; the Society have hi|therto failed very much in their charitable de|&s;ign. For though their mi&s;&s;ionaries have, fir&s;t and la&s;t, made a con&s;iderable number of pro|&s;elytes from our churches, many of whom needed to be bettered in their morals; yet it may be que&s;tioned whether any of them have thereby been brought back to good manners and a chri&s;tian life: Po&s;&s;ibly there may have been &s;ome, though I never knew an example of it.

I lately met with a very remarkable account of the &s;agaci|ty of &s;ome of them in one of the <HI>ab&s;tracts,</HI> and the prodigious improvement which they had made in a &s;hort time under the documents of a mi&s;&s;ionary: It was to this purpo&s;e;&mdash;They had di&s;covered that there were in the liturgy <HI>no re|mains of popery</HI> and the <HI>ma&s;s-book,</HI> as they had formerly &s;uppo&s;ed!&mdash;Nor are there a few epi&s;copalians, who &s;eem to have much the &s;ame opinion of <HI>that compo&s;ition,</HI> that the old Ephe&s;ians had of their famous, adored image, which, they were &s;o confident, <HI>fell down im|mediately from Jupiter</HI>; and of their church, that tho&s;e zealots had of their godde&s;s, when they bauled by the &s;pace of two hours toge|ther, <HI>Great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians</HI>!</P>

<P>THE affair of Bi&s;hops has lately been, and pro|bably now is in agitation in England.

Tho' even in this ca&s;e, it might well be que&s;tioned whether their conduct would have been entirely ju&s;tifiable; becau&s;e their charter warrants neither their re|ceiving nor expending any money for &s;upport|ing any one party what&s;oever among&s;t prote&s;|tants, in oppo&s;ition to another; but only for the common cau&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to athei&s;m, infidelity and popery. But the Socie|ty have by no means thus abounded in money. They have been making great complaints for half a century pa&s;t, how &s;treightened they were for money; how much their annual expences exceeded their certain annual income. Dr. HUTTON, bi&s;hop of Bangor, in his &s;ermon be|fore the Society 1745, (p. 24.) &s;ays, they have borne <Q>an expence frequently more than <HI>five times</HI> equal to their certain annual income.</Q> The&s;e repre&s;entations have been very pathetical|ly made from time to time, in order to induce good people of <HI>all denominations</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;o pious a work, as that of &s;upporting the public wor&s;hip of God in tho&s;e colonies which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be de&s;titute of it, and propa|pating the go&s;pel among the poor <HI>Negroes</HI> and
<PB N="110" REF="009441_0108_0F748DDA4FF4CB08"><HI>Indians.</HI> This &s;hall at any time be proved at large by quotations from the &s;ermons, and other publications of the Society, if any per&s;on of re|putation denies it, as I am confident no one will pre&s;ume to do. And yet, while the&s;e loud, and almo&s;t tragical complaints have been mak|ing, the Society have been expending large &s;ums every year in New-England, quite beyond the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, to &s;upport and in|crea&s;e the epi&s;copal party as &s;uch; greatly to the neglect of the Southern colonies upon the con|tinent, the Indians bordering upon us, the We&s;t India i&s;lands, and the many thou&s;ands of Negro &s;laves in them; all of which and whom were the direct proper objects of their charity; and who&s;e <HI>names</HI> were made u&s;e of mo&s;t pathetical|ly to excite compa&s;&s;ion in, and draw money from well di&s;po&s;ed people of <HI>every</HI> denomina|tion! It needs no proof, that by how much more was done by the Society for the &s;upport of the epi&s;copal party here; by &s;o much le&s;s mu&s;t unavoidably have been done for the hea|then, or for the colonies in a &s;tate but little bet|ter than that of heatheni&s;m. And if the Socie|ty cannot, in this re&s;pect, be &s;aid to have "rob|bed other churches," to ea&s;e and gratify the epi&s;copalians here; yet they may be &s;aid to have <HI>robbed</HI> the heathen, the &s;laves, and heatheni&s;h colonies afore&s;aid; who had an exclu&s;ive right, according to the charter, to the benefit of that very money which has been &s;unk in the epi&s;co|pal gulph here, where the people actually "had the means of religion in other prote&s;tant com|munions."

So that, according to a mo|derate calculation, there may have been about &pound;.1200 &s;terling expended by the Society for N. England, one year with another, for 32 years pa&s;t; amounting to 38,400 And about &pound;.200 per <HI>Annum</HI> for 20 years preceeding 1730, amounting to 4,000 <HI>Total Er. excepted,</HI> 42,400 &s;terl.</P>
<P>BUT then a deduction is to be made on ac|count of that part of this &s;um which may have been expended conformably to the de&s;ign of the charter, in &s;upporting the public wor&s;hip in &s;ome places in N. England, particularly Rhode-I&s;land government, where the Society's charity was need|ed. If we deduct &pound;.7400, there has been about 35,000 &s;terl, mi&s;applied in N. England, according to the rea&s;oning in the proceeding &s;ections. I &s;hall take the liberty to go upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, tho' I do not pretend to be very exact as to the <HI>quan|tum</HI>; I believe it is not le&s;s than that. The benefit of this &s;um then, other per&s;ons, the Negro &s;laves, Indians and heatheni&s;h colonies, have been de|prived of; tho' the money was as it were col|lected in <HI>their name,</HI> or with a profe&s;&s;ion of employing it in <HI>their</HI> &s;ervice.</P>
<P>NOW let it be con&s;idered, how much good might probably have been done to the &s;ouls of the&s;e people, the direct, proper objects of this charity, had the afore&s;aid &s;um of 35,000 &s;terl.
<PB N="114" REF="009441_0112_0F748DDD13AC8790">been duly applied in maintaining and propagat|ing chri&s;tianity among them, in&s;tead of being laid out to &s;upport and increa&s;e the epi&s;copal party in tho&s;e towns of N. England, in which people <Q>had the means of religion already, in <HI>other prote&s;tant communions.</HI></Q> Forty or fifty mi&s;&s;ions might, with this &s;um, have been com|fortably maintained among the heathen, and in heatheni&s;h places, every year, for more than thirty years pa&s;t; and a con&s;iderable number for &s;everal years antecedent thereto. It is well known that in &s;ome of the Southern colonies, there are large di&s;tricts of 10, 20, 30, and 40 miles extent, and I think more, wherein there is no publick wor&s;hip of any kind regularly kept up, for want of mini&s;ters; in which colonies there are al&s;o many Roman-catholics and &s;laves. And their &s;tate, to this day, an&s;wers very exactly to the de&s;cription in the charter, of tho&s;e places which are therein marked out as the objects of this charitable in&s;titution. The &s;ame in general is applicable to &s;ome of our We&s;t-India i&s;lands, all which &s;o much abound with Negro &s;laves.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e then, that about one half the afore&s;aid &s;um had been employed in &s;upporting mi&s;&s;ions and &s;chools in tho&s;e colonies, and the other half among the <HI>Indians</HI> bordering upon us. How much good might probably have been done, by keeping up &s;ome form of religion, and giving a <HI>check</HI> at lea&s;t to infidelity, vice and bar|barity in the former; and by propagating the knowledge of true religion among&s;t the latter?
<PB N="115" REF="009441_0113_0F748DDDDBF09298">In what degree it might have plea&s;ed almighty God to &s;ucceed the&s;e mi&s;&s;ions, it is indeed im|po&s;&s;ible for man particularly to &s;ay. But &s;uch an application of the money would unque&s;tiona|bly have been right and proper, according to the charter: And the de&s;ign had at lea&s;t been cha|ritable, noble and laudable, whatever the &s;ucce&s;s had been. Nor is there any rea&s;on to doubt in general, but that &s;ome, yea, great good would have been done, if all the mi&s;applied money had been di&s;cretely expended in the&s;e ways. The general &s;tate of religion in tho&s;e colonies would, in all probability, have been much better at this day than it is. Many per&s;ons might have been re&s;trained from open vice and impiety; not a few brought to a &s;erious &s;en&s;e and practice of religion; a great number of the Negro &s;laves in, and the Indians near the colonies, brought to &s;ome hopeful knowledge of God and his truth had as many pious, and duly qualified mi&s;&s;iona|ries been &s;ent to one and the other, for thirty or forty years pa&s;t, as might have been tolerably &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the afore&s;aid &s;um, which has been very little, if any thing better than thrown away; yea, which many think really wor&s;e than thrown away, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered. Nor am I either a&s;hamed or afraid to own my&s;elf of this latter opinion; being per&s;uaded that there is le&s;s real religion now in tho&s;e parts of N. England where it has been expended, than there would have been, had it been &s;unk in the ocean in&s;tead of the epi&s;copal gulph here: Tho' it is
<PB N="116" REF="009441_0114_0F748DDE8F304670">not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that any epi&s;copalians can be of this opinion; neither is any &s;tre&s;s laid upon it in the pre&s;ent argument. But even allowing that &s;ome good has been done by converting a number of pre&s;byterians, &amp;c. to the church of England; yet what &s;ober and candid per&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly imagine, that the common cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity has been a tenth part &s;o much &s;erved hereby, as might have been rea&s;onably expected from a different application of this money, in ways directly and indi&s;putably agreeable to the intent of the charter? What the venerable So|ciety may think of the&s;e things, I cannot pre|tend to &s;ay: But I know, many wi&s;e and good men think they have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, that they are not them&s;elves to give an account to him for &s;uch managements; and that the blood of &s;o many as have probably peri&s;hed thereby, <HI>will not be required at</HI> THEIR <HI>hands.</HI></P>

<P>THO' I will not affirm it for truth, yet I have been very credibly informed, that the
<PB N="117" REF="009441_0115_0F748DDF73CF9C60">people in &s;ome of the Southern colonies, and par|ticularly in tho&s;e parts of N. Carolina which were intirely de&s;titute of mini&s;ters, have made earne&s;t and repeated applications to the Society for mi&s;&s;iona|ries to be &s;ent to them; &s;ometimes without any an&s;wer at all, for years together; and at la&s;t with|out &s;ucce&s;s. And &s;ome &s;olid, &s;en&s;ible and &s;erious per&s;ons from that country, with whom I conver|&s;ed in Bo&s;ton &s;everal years ago, I think gave me the &s;ame account: But whether they did or not, I know they made &s;uch a repre&s;entation of their &s;ad &s;tate for want of mini&s;ters, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;erious a de&s;ire of having the public wor&s;hip of God introduced among them, that at this very moment it is not in my power to refrain from tears in reflecting on it&mdash;What they told me, at lea&s;t confirms in &s;ome mea&s;ure the report afore|&s;aid, concerning the ineffectual &s;ollicitations from thence to the Society; who perhaps had it not in their power to comply therewith, by rea&s;on of the large expence which they were at in the noble de&s;ign of &s;upporting and increa&s;ing little epi&s;co|pal parties, or factions, here and there in N. En|gland. And according to the <HI>Ab&s;tract,</HI> 1761, the Society had only five mi&s;&s;ionaries in the whole country of N. Carolina, while they had about thirty in N. England; chiefly in the mo&s;t populous towns of it, where a due and legal pro|vi&s;ion was made for the &s;upport of mini&s;ters, and the public wor&s;hip of God!</P>
<P>AS to the Indians; no one can doubt but that there have been, and &s;till are, &s;ome great, di&s;cou|ragements
<PB N="118" REF="009441_0116_0F748DE002EDB9B0">in attempting to chri&s;tianize them. But, according to divers appearances, the Society have had this work le&s;s at heart than that of pro|pagating the peculiarities of epi&s;copacy and the liturgy in N. England, in oppo&s;ition to pre&s;byte|riani&s;m and congregationali&s;m. The neglect of the Natives in America, has long been complained of, and the accu&s;ation in &s;ome &s;ort allowed to be ju&s;t by them&s;elves, in times pa&s;t. This will appear in part from Bp. WILLIAMS's &s;ermon before the Society, 1705. <Q>But whil&s;t we find <HI>fault</HI> with others,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>we mu&s;t not forget <HI>our own.</HI> It has been the continual matter of <HI>reproach</HI> to us, that this application to the <HI>Natives</HI> has been <HI>neglected on our part.</HI> Where are the numbers you have converted to the Chri&s;tian faith? Where the fruits of your re|ligion? when you have under your care tho&s;e va&s;t dominions which are called the <HI>Engli&s;h empire</HI>; and from whence you draw &s;o much of your emoluments to enrich and plea&s;ure your&s;elves at home. This is an objection that <HI>has its weight,</HI> and perhaps is <HI>uncapable</HI> of a ju&s;t and &s;ufficient an&s;wer. Recriminations are but a kind of confe&s;&s;ion of guilt: And the be&s;t way to an&s;wer, is, <HI>to mend what is ami&s;s in our&s;elves</HI></Q>&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Edit. p. 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is unnece&s;&s;ary to confirm and ju&s;tify this complaint by an appeal to any of the later &s;er|mons before the Society; which would be no difficult matter. Some e&s;&s;ays they have indeed
<PB N="119" REF="009441_0117_0F748DE159D56F10">made from time to time, towards the conver&s;ion of the Savages: but they &s;eem to have been very faint and feeble; and with a &s;paring hand as to money, when compared with the goodne&s;s and importance of the work, or the difficulties to be expected in it; with the zeal of our French neighbours to chri&s;tianize, or rather <HI>popize</HI> the Indians, and even with their <HI>own zeal</HI> and expen|ces in order to <HI>epi&s;copize</HI> the Congregationali&s;ts and Pre&s;byterians of N. England. I am not ignorant however, that they and their mi&s;&s;iona|ries have frequently given the world &s;ufficiently pompous accounts of their efforts in order to the conver&s;ion of the Indians; not to &s;ay, &s;poken &s;omewhat hyperbolically of the real and great difficulties attending this work. Tho' I doubt not but that the Society kept to the accounts given them by their mi&s;&s;ionaries; who &s;eem to have been le&s;s indefatigable, and &s;ooner di&s;cou|raged in their labors among the Indians than a|mong Us. And tho' the following remark of Dr. DOUGLASS, a very attentive and capable ob|&s;erver of what pa&s;&s;ed in the colonies, is not lite|rally true of <HI>all</HI> the mi&s;&s;ionaries in America, yet it de&s;erves notice here: <Q>The mi&s;&s;ionaries from the Society,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>do not <HI>in the lea&s;t</HI> attempt the conver&s;ion of the Indians, <HI>becau&s;e it requires travel, labor and hard&s;hip.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Summary Hi&s;torical and Political,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>IT is certain from authentic records, even from &s;everal publications of the Society, that the <HI>Five,</HI> alias <HI>Six nations,</HI> a re&s;pectable and war-like
<PB N="120" REF="009441_0118_0F748DE1CBAE66F8">people on the Frontiers of N.

Their chiefs have even petitioned for them re|peatedly; of which the Society was duly adver|ti&s;ed by the Governor of N. York, as appears from the <HI>Ab&s;tracts,</HI> &amp;c. Nor have they been <HI>wholly</HI> neglected by the Society; than which, it is ap|prehended, little more can be &s;aid, notwith&s;tand|ing all that Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> has written concerning their "unwearied zeal in this attempt <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;id.,</HI> p 15, 16.</NOTE>". In &s;peaking of this matter, Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> has referred to Dr. BARCLAY, now a mi&s;&s;ionary in the city of N. York; who was for a time a mi&s;&s;ionary to the&s;e Indians.

<P>IN the year 1738 Mr. SERGEANT, the then very worthy mi&s;&s;ionary to a tribe of Indians on our we&s;tern frontiers, employed by the Bo&s;ton-commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Society for the propagation of

But I labor under <HI>great di&s;advantage for want of an interpreter</HI>; &s;o that I cannot tell what progre&s;s they may make in knowledge, nor can I proceed regularly in my in&s;tructions; and I mu&s;t de&s;pair of obtaining a perfect know|ledge of their language, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an interpreter, which could I but enjoy <HI>for the &s;pace of two or three years,</HI> I doubt not but that I &s;hould be ma&s;ter of it; and &s;hould take greater plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction in the di&s;|charge of my duty.

<P>MORE than two years after Mr. BARCLAY had taken <HI>Orders,</HI> he wrote thus in another let|ter dated at Albany <HI>Aug.</HI> 21, 1740. <Q>I am &s;a|tisfied I &s;hould have much greater &s;ucce&s;s, if I had a <HI>&s;chool-ma&s;ter</HI> and <HI>interpreter.</HI> I had the &s;atisfaction la&s;t Lord's day to preach to a num|ber of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> who came to this town to treat with the Governor, who al&s;o was pre&s;ent; and has taken a great deal of pains to countenance my de&s;ign.

<P>FROM the foregoing repre&s;entation it is evi|dent, that a wide door was opened for the go&s;pel to enter among tho&s;e heathen tribes; The fields were white unto the harve&s;t, had but labourers been &s;ent, and duly encouraged to the noble work. The&s;e tribes would probably have been in general profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians before this day, had the bu&s;ine&s;s been duly forwarded and encou|raged. Which might perhaps, by rea&s;on of the great fame of the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> have had a very ex|ten&s;ive and happy influence on many other na|tions. But, alas! the Society, tho' &s;o de&s;irous of chri&s;tianizing the natives, could not afford &s;alaries to a &s;chool-ma&s;ter and interpreter, of per|haps about &pound;.20 or &pound;.30 &s;terling each; nor to Mr. BARCLAY him&s;elf, who was &s;o zealous in this good cau&s;e, half a proper &s;upport! Why not? The rea&s;on was apparently this; that they &s;upported &s;o many mi&s;&s;ionaries here in N. Eng|land at a great expence, for the encouragement of the epi&s;copal party, and in order to convert us to the liturgy. If &s;o great a proportion of their revenue had not been thus unprofitably &s;unk in places where God's word and &s;acraments were duly admini&s;tred, how ea&s;y would it have been for them to &s;upport 5, 6, or more mi&s;&s;iona|ries, and as many interpreters and &s;chool-ma&s;ters among the <HI>Iroquois</HI>? Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;peaking of the "promi&s;ing appearance" there was among the

Of the important <HI>political ends</HI> that might have been an&s;wered, had the Society taken due care to &s;end proper Mi&s;&s;iona|ries to the <HI>Indians</HI>; and the pernicious Con&s;equences of their Neglect.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the&s;e ob&s;ervations is &s;en&s;ible that worldly politics, and temporal things were not the direct objects of this in&s;titution; but the promotion of true religion, and the eter|nal happine&s;s of men. However, the&s;e things often &s;tand in a clo&s;e connexion, and are in a mea&s;ure interwoven with each other. And the Society's pro&s;ecuting that important part of their plan, the conver&s;ion of the heathen bordering on our American colonies, would at the &s;ame time have an&s;wered very valuable ends of a po|litical nature. This, one would think, was an <HI>additional</HI> obligation lying upon them to do &s;o, in&s;tead of neglecting it for the &s;ake of convert|ing us to the liturgy, in the manner they have done. That &s;uch ends would, in all probability, have been an&s;wered thereby; and that this neg|lect has been attended with very fatal con&s;equen|ces in a civil con&s;ideration of things, may ap|pear from the following remarks.</P>
<P>IT is known that the Indian nations lie on the back of our &s;ettlements, from N. Scotia
<PB N="127" REF="009441_0125_0F748DE7905B87D0">Northward, round to the We&s;t and S. We&s;t as far as Georgia and Florida. And had early and due care been taken by the Society to &s;end as many mi&s;&s;ionaries among them, as could have been &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the money &s;o unprofitably &s;unk in N. England; it would have had a direct and manife&s;t tendency to attach them to the Bri|ti&s;h intere&s;t. Had this &pound;.35,000 &s;terl. or the greater part of it, been employed in maintaining a number of &s;en&s;ible, di&s;crete mini&s;ters among the Indians, and enabling them to make them &s;mall pre&s;ents from time to time, in order to gain their e&s;teem and good-will, it might probably have been the means, not only of giving them at lea&s;t &s;ome favourable impre&s;&s;ions of Chri&s;ti|anity in general, but of the prote&s;tant religion; and &s;o making the greater part of them our fa&s;t friends.</P>
<P>And there was the more occa&s;ion for taking this cour&s;e, in order to counter-act the de&s;igns of the French, till of late our dangerous ene|mies and rivals on this continent. They, if not from a principle of piety, yet of &s;ound policy, have all along made a point of &s;ending je&s;uits, prie&s;ts and other emi&s;&s;aries to all the Indian tribes that would admit them. It is evident that the Society were not ignorant of the&s;e circum&s;tances; which were well known the Briti&s;h court, even before the charter was granted; and in all pro|bability, were one rea&s;on of its being granted. It may be added, that the Society did, from the fir&s;t, <HI>profe&s;s</HI> to have a regard to them. The
<PB N="128" REF="009441_0126_0F748DE844E68058">following extracts from the <HI>Account of the Society,</HI> will &s;erve at once to throw light upon this affair, and to render their neglect the more <HI>unaccounta|ble.</HI> They &s;ay,
<Q>Nor hath the Society been unmindful of u&s;ing their <HI>utmo&s;t endeavours</HI> for propagating the go&s;pel among the heathen <HI>In|dians</HI> and &s;laves in and near our plantations. They received with great &s;atisfaction a letter from the <HI>Lords commi&s;&s;ioners of trade and plan|tations,</HI> directed to the Ld. arch. bp. of Canter|bury,</Q> &s;ignifying, <Q>That the earl of Bellamont had &s;everal times repre&s;ented to them the great want of &s;ome mini&s;ters of the church of England, to in&s;truct the Five Nations of In|dians on the frontiers of N. York, and <HI>pre|vent their being practis'd upon by French prie&s;ts and je&s;ui&s;ts.</HI></Q>&mdash; <Q>At the &s;ame time the Lords commi&s;&s;ioners imparted to his Grace, and to the Lord bp. of London, &s;ome farther advice upon the &s;ubject&mdash;in particular this remarkable extract of what was &s;aid by One in the name of the re&s;t of the <HI>Sachems</HI>&mdash;to the commi&s;&s;io|ners for the Indian affairs in Albany, June 28, 1700</Q>&mdash;Says he, <Q>We are now come to trade; and not to &s;peak of religion. Only thus much I mu&s;t &s;ay, all the while I was here, before I went to Canada, I never heard any thing talk'd of religion, or the lea&s;t mention made of converting us to the Chri&s;tian faith. And we &s;hall be <HI>glad</HI> to hear, if at la&s;t you are &s;o piou&s;ly inclined to take pains to in&s;truct your Indians in the Chri&s;tian religion. I will not
<PB N="129" REF="009441_0127_0F748DE8F69B85D0">&s;ay but that it may induce &s;ome to return to their native country. <HI>I wish it had been done &s;ooner,</HI> that you had had mini&s;ters to in&s;truct your Indians in the Chri&s;tian faith,</Q> &amp;c. `This repre&s;entation,' the Society add, <Q>was laid before the Queen in council; from whence his Grace the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury re|ported this order.</Q></P>
<P><HI>At the Court at St.</HI> James's, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>Upon reading this day at the Board a re|pre&s;entation&mdash;&s;etting forth, among other things, that as to the Five Nations bordering on New-York, le&s;t the intrigues of the French in Canada, and the influence of their prie&s;ts, who frequent and conver&s;e, and &s;ometimes in|habit with tho&s;e Indians, &s;hould debauch them from her Maje&s;ty's allegiance, their Lord&s;hips are humbly of opinion&mdash;that two prote&s;tant mini&s;ters be appointed,</Q> &amp;c. The Society add, <Q>Upon communicating this order to the Society, it was immediately agreed, that it &s;hould be referred to a committee,</Q> &amp;c. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Account,</HI> &amp;c. p. 38&mdash;41. printed 1706.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE chief de&s;ign of this quotation, is to &s;hew how early and fully the Society were appri&s;ed of the intrigues of the French with the Indians on this continent, and the importance of coun|ter-acting their de&s;igns, in a political as well as religious con&s;ideration of things. The&s;e things they have known all along, from the very foun|dation of the Society. And yet, that they have done hardly any thing towards the conver&s;ion of the Indians; and either could not or would
<PB N="130" REF="009441_0128_0F748DE9ED8AD040">not allow even an interpreter or School-ma&s;ter to Mr. BARCLAY, is equally certain: Their object, to all appearance, having been rather the extirpation of pre&s;byteriani&s;m and congregation|i&s;m from the colonies, than the planting of Chri&s;tanity among the Indians; whereby they might at once have been in&s;trumental of &s;aving many &s;ouls, and doing an important &s;ervice to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>HAD the Society applied the money which they have &s;unk in New-England, (in a way quite unauthorized by their charter) to the &s;up|port of mi&s;&s;ions among the Indians, it is quite probable, as was intimated before, that the great|er part of tho&s;e bordering on our colonies might long &s;ince have received very favourable im|pre&s;&s;ions of the Chri&s;tian, prote&s;tant religion, and been amicable to us. We &s;hould of cour&s;e have had a much larger &s;hare of the profita|ble trade with them, which has been almo&s;t engro&s;&s;ed by the French. And, as many of them might have been in a degree civilized at the &s;ame time, and brought into the Engli&s;h way of living; they would of cour&s;e have taken off a greater quantity of Briti&s;h manu|factures, and other commodities, to the national advantage. The lives of great numbers of Bri|ti&s;h &s;ubjects in the plantations, de&s;troyed by the Savages from time to time, would have been &s;aved. The colonies which have been kept in terror, and &s;tunted in their growth, their frontiers having often been quite cut off, or broken up, would have been in a much more
<PB N="131" REF="009441_0129_0F748DEAA1BCE2F8">flouri&s;hing condition than they are at pre&s;ent. And mo&s;t of the&s;e Indians, in&s;tead of being at the command of the French, to cut our throats and &s;calp us, whenever they thought proper; might have been ready to act for us again&s;t them, on any ju&s;t occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the important political ends that might probably have been an&s;wered, had the Society thought proper to &s;end mi&s;&s;ion|aries among the Indians, (who&s;e conver&s;ion they have all along declared to be a principal, tho' not a primary object with them) in&s;tead of &s;ink|ing &s;o much money in the epi&s;copal gulph in New-England. And when we al&s;o con&s;ider how duly they have been adverti&s;ed of the French intrigues from time to time, and of the importance of counter-acting them; it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, whether their piety or their patrioti&s;m is the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, with re|lation to this part of their conduct. And, whether their affection for, and &s;trong attach|ment to the peculiarities of a <HI>party,</HI> are not at lea&s;t as con&s;picuous as either of them, the rea|der who is not afraid to think, is left to judge from the whole &s;eries of facts and circum&s;tances.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIX.
Of the <HI>di&s;cretionary Power</HI> of the Society, and Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s Rea&s;oning thereon.</HEAD>
<P>THE ingenious Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> to whom I mu&s;t now again pay my devoirs, urges the large di&s;cretionary power of the So|ciety, in order to vindicate their conduct. The pa&s;&s;age to which I refer, &s;eems to have &s;ome|thing &s;o very <HI>curious</HI> in it, that I cannot but quote it at large for the <HI>entertainment</HI> of the reader.</P>
<P>"IT is ob&s;ervable," &s;ays he, <Q>that a <HI>large di&s;cretionary power</HI> is left to the Society, to regulate their in&s;titution, <HI>and even occa&s;ionally to make</HI> ALTERATIONS in it, in &s;uch a man|ner as to render it mo&s;t beneficial to religion, whether in our colonies, or among the bor|dering nations. For this purpo&s;e, they and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever are empowered to make any laws or con&s;titutions that &s;hall &s;eem rea&s;onable, profitable or requi&s;ite for the good e&s;tate and government of the Society, and the effectual promoting its <HI>charitable de&s;ign.</HI> Thus, <HI>with an evidence beyond exception,</HI> it appears that their conduct in placing churches AMONG US, <HI>is in all re&s;pects</HI> CONFORMABLE <HI>to their in&s;titution</HI></Q>&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;id.</HI> p. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="133" REF="009441_0131_0F748DEDB524D008">1. IT is to be ob&s;erved, that Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> here refers to that part of the charter which re|lates to by-laws; but in quoting which (p. 10.) he has tran&s;po&s;ed &s;ome clau&s;es and omitted o|thers, without giving notice of it to his readers in the u&s;ual way. However, &s;ince in his own way of quoting it, there does not &s;eem to be any very material alteration in the &s;en&s;e; it will not be worth while to compare the quotation and charter together, merely for the &s;ake of &s;hew|ing &s;ome of his harmle&s;s errors. But had a re|puted Scholar quoted any di&s;puted pa&s;&s;age in LIVY, TACITUS or CICERO, in the manner in which this gentleman quoted another part of the charter, before taken notice of; it would have been no ea&s;y matter for him ever to regain his reputation in the learned world. Whether mi&s;quoting the charter in this controver&s;y, is not an offence of a much higher nature, is &s;ub|mitted to the judgment of the impartial reader.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT &s;eems a pretty extraordinary po&s;ition, that any incorporated Society &s;hould have power by their charter, <HI>to make alterations in their in|&s;titution.</HI> If this Society has any &s;uch, Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> was doubtle&s;s right in &s;peaking of it as <HI>a large di&s;cretionary power</HI>! For is not a power to make <HI>alterations</HI> in their in&s;titution, equivalent to a power to <HI>alter their in&s;titution it&s;elf</HI>;&mdash;to depart in a great mea&s;ure from the original plan according to the charter, and to pur&s;ue ends different from tho&s;e which are ex|pre&s;&s;ed therein? And what corporation ever had &s;o large a di&s;cretionary power as this?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="134" REF="009441_0132_0F748DEE90DDEEA0">3. BY laying claim to &s;uch an extraordinary power for the Society, and making u&s;e of this as an argument to ju&s;tify their conduct, Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;eems to allow that they &s;tand in <HI>need</HI> or it for that purpo&s;e. The gentleman &s;urely would not have had recour&s;e to &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed wonderful power ve&s;ted in the Society, if their conduct could be reconciled with the mo&s;t plain, obvious &s;en&s;e of the charter.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS is, in effect, tho' not expre&s;ly, a con|ce&s;&s;ion that the Society have actually made <HI>al|terations</HI> in their in&s;titution: and have really been pur&s;uing de&s;igns not expre&s;ly authorized by the charter. That this is fact, I am far from denying. But the gentleman well knows, that the que&s;tions <HI>de facto</HI> and <HI>de jure,</HI> are very dif|ferent: And if he can clear up that <HI>of right,</HI> as plainly as I flatter my&s;elf I have and &s;hall do that <HI>of fact,</HI> our debate will be half fini&s;hed. But &s;till it mu&s;t be remembered, that tho' the Society had confe&s;&s;edly a power to make <HI>alterations</HI> in their in&s;titution, by neglecting &s;ome ends thereof particularly mentioned in the charter, and pur&s;uing others not mentioned; yet unle&s;s they are &s;uppo&s;ed infallible and impec|cable, <HI>the&s;e alterations</HI> may be for the <HI>wor&s;e.</HI> That the alterations which they have made, are for the <HI>better,</HI> will not follow, as he &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, from their having had a <HI>legal</HI> power to make them. Allowing the power, if by altering they mend their in&s;titution, they are doubtle&s;s to be prai&s;ed in that re&s;pect: But what|ever power they may have, if they pejorate their
<PB N="135" REF="009441_0133_0F748DEEF7A930F8">in&s;titution, and pur&s;ue comparatively mean and low ends, in&s;tead of the noble ones expre&s;&s;ed in the charter, Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> will not deny but that this is an error of judgment at be&s;t, and a real abu&s;e of their power. Whoever would fully vindicate the Society, mu&s;t prove, not only that they are actually inve&s;ted with &s;uch a power, but that they have u&s;ed it di&s;cretely and wi&s;ely; &s;o as mo&s;t effectually to an&s;wer the general and excellent end of their in&s;titution: To alledge <HI>power only</HI> in their vindication, is not giving rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction to tho&s;e who may except again&s;t their conduct: Becau&s;e even a legal power may be abu&s;ed, or a di&s;cretionary power mi&s;applied. But,</P>
<P N="5">5. THE charter contains no expre&s;&s;ion equi|valent or &s;imilar to this, of a power left to the Society <HI>to make alterations in their in&s;titution.</HI> The &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed therein, relative to the power given them, are the&s;e&mdash;<Q>The &s;aid Society &s;hall and may con&s;ult, determine, con|&s;titute, ordain and make <HI>any con&s;titutions, laws, ordinances and &s;tatutes</HI> what&s;oever; as al&s;o execute lea&s;es for years, as afore&s;aid, which to them, or the major part of them then pre&s;ent, &s;hall &s;eem rea&s;onable, profitable or requi&s;ite, for, touching or concerning the good e&s;tate, rule, order and government of the &s;aid cor|poration, <HI>and the more effectual promoting the &s;aid charitable de&s;igns.</HI></Q> Now is there any thing here, that is in the lea&s;t &s;imilar to a power of making <HI>alterations in their in&s;titution</HI>?&mdash;or a right to apply their fund in any manner what|ever, not expre&s;&s;ed in their charter? So far from it, that,</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="136" REF="009441_0134_0F748DEFC1CD6D00">6. THE Society are, by this very part of the charter which, it is pretended, gives them &s;uch an extraordinary power, limited and confined to tho&s;e ends or objects, which had before been expre&s;ly mentioned as the ends of the in&s;titution. For the power here granted them to make con|&s;titutions, laws, &amp;c. is, in expre&s;s terms, in or|der to "the more effectual promoting <HI>the &s;aid charitable de&s;igns.</HI>" And what, in the name of <HI>charity,</HI> are they? Is any one of them, the &s;up|porting and increa&s;ing little epi&s;copal parties and factions in tho&s;e colonies, where due and legal provi&s;ion was before made for the public wor|&s;hip of God; and where the people "had the means of religion already, in other <HI>prote&s;tant communions</HI>?"&mdash;and this to the manife&s;t preju|dice of tho&s;e colonies in which no &s;uch provi|&s;ion was made for the admini&s;tration of God's word and ordinances;&mdash;of the Negro &s;laves and Savages! I a&s;k again, whether this is one of <HI>the &s;aid charitable de&s;igns</HI>? If it is, then the Society have unque&s;tionably a right to make con&s;titu|tions, laws, &amp;c. in order to <HI>the more effectual promoting it</HI>: But if not, what can be le&s;s per|tinent and &s;atisfactory, than to alledge the large di&s;cretionary power given them, to ju&s;tify their conduct in this re&s;pect? And how did this <HI>in|ventive</HI> gentleman come to talk of a power <HI>to make alterations in their in&s;titution</HI>? What that in&s;titution is, and all the ends of it, have been &s;ufficiently explained before: And whatever they are, the Society are here confined, limited and tied down to them, as much as if they had
<PB N="137" REF="009441_0135_0F748DF08BA3BC80">again been enumerated in the very words of the preamble; to which the reader is referred. The Society mu&s;t indeed, in the nature of the thing, if they act with &s;implicity and integrity in this important affair', act as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t <HI>rea&s;onable, profitable,</HI> &amp;c. in order to ac|compli&s;h <HI>the &s;aid de&s;igns</HI>; as other per&s;ons in|tru&s;ted with a di&s;cretionary power in order to accompli&s;h <HI>certain ends,</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o act. But their <HI>in&s;titution it&s;elf is fixed,</HI> immutably <HI>fixed</HI> by the charter; &s;o that they have not the lea&s;t power to make <HI>alterations</HI> in it; but only to pro&s;ecute, in the mo&s;t effectual manner, the declared ends of it. And if any incorporated charitable So|ciety what&s;oever, under the pretext of a di&s;creti|onary power, neglect the declared ends of their in&s;titution; and pur&s;ue others, to which their charter is a &s;tranger, they cannot but be con&s;i|dered as acting contrary to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them: But whether wilfully, or thro' mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion, is another que&s;tion; re&s;pecting which people may have different opinions. But,</P>
<P N="7">7. HAS not the ingenious Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> a very &s;ingular way of rea&s;oning here? He certainly makes u&s;e of a kind of <HI>logic,</HI> which very few of the <HI>un-orthodox</HI> N. England mini&s;ters learnt at <HI>our</HI> little, young Colleges. For, having endea|voured to e&s;tabli&s;h this extraordinary di&s;cretio|nary power of the Society to make <HI>alterations</HI> in their in&s;titution, as if all depended upon it; the triumphant conclu&s;ion at length comes out in the following words: <Q>THUS, with an <HI>evidence
<PB N="138" REF="009441_0136_0F748DF14D3009A0">beyond exception,</HI> it appears, that their conduct in placing churches AMONG US, is <HI>in all re&s;|pects</HI> CONFORMABLE TO THEIR INSTITU|TION</Q>&mdash; i. e. becau&s;e he had made it &s;o evi|dent, that they had power to make ALTERA|TIONS in their in&s;titution; therefore they have made NONE, nor in the lea&s;t deviated from it; but their conduct is in <HI>all re&s;pects</HI> CONFORMA|BLE thereto! And this, it is &s;aid, appears from the premi&s;es, <HI>with an evidence beyond exception</HI>&mdash; But if their conduct is thus conformable to their in&s;titution, why did Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> attempt to ju&s;tify it, by a&s;&s;erting their power to <HI>alter</HI> their in&s;titution? As his argument now &s;tands, the premi&s;es and the conclu&s;ion unluckily frown on, and militate again&s;t each other. I have try'd &s;everal ways to reconcile them; but to no pur|po&s;e. I have endeavoured to &s;uppo&s;e, that this po&s;ition about the large di&s;cretionary power of the Society, was bro't in only as Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Indian conver&s;ions are undertaken by the Society,</HI> viz. <Q>incidentally, and as it were ex-<HI>abundanti</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> p. 15.</NOTE></Q>. But &s;till, either the conclu&s;ion knocks down the premi&s;es, or the premi&s;es the conclu&s;ion. I have al&s;o endeavoured to &s;uppo&s;e the ingenious gentleman's meaning was, that the Society's conduct, was conformable to their in&s;ti|tution, <HI>after they had made alterations in it,</HI> by virtue of their "large di&s;cretionary power"; not as it was <HI>originally</HI>: But neither, can I make this bear, in &s;everal re&s;pects. The war &s;till continues
<PB N="139" REF="009441_0137_0F748DF21B706DE8">between the former and latter branch of the ar|gument: So that they mu&s;t be left to fight it out betwixt them.</P>

Remarks on Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s curious Appli|cation of tho&s;e Words, <HI>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own</HI>? &amp;c. to the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y.</HEAD>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the pa&s;&s;age la&s;t quoted, Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> that he might oblige us with &s;ome of his <HI>rhetoric</HI> together with his <HI>invincible arguments,</HI> &s;ubjoins&mdash; <Q>And to any one who cries out on <HI>imaginary</HI> abu&s;es or mi&s;applicati|ons, the Society may reply, like the good <HI>Hou&s;holder</HI> who&s;e <HI>&s;tewards</HI> they are, <HI>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? is thine eye evil, becau&s;e I am good</HI>?</Q></P>
<P>LET it here be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT whatever the Society might ju&s;tly reply to tho&s;e who cry out on <HI>imaginary abu&s;es</HI> or <HI>mi&s;applications</HI>; the &s;ame reply would not be valid or pertinent to tho&s;e who cry out on <HI>real</HI> ones.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Society are hero very ju&s;tly &s;tiled <HI>&s;tew|ards.</HI> And they were intru&s;ted with the care of a charitable fund, not only by God, as he &s;eems to
<PB N="140" REF="009441_0138_0F748DF2BA325890">intend, but by men; by the King, who granted their charter, and by all who have contributed to the charitable de&s;igns expre&s;&s;ed therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. A LEARNED clergyman, like him, doubt|le&s;s knows, it is "required in <HI>&s;tewards</HI> that a man be found <HI>faithful.</HI>" Stewards are not al|lowed to u&s;e the goods or money with which they are intru&s;ted, but for tho&s;e ends and pur|po&s;es for which they are committed to them. If they knowingly apply them to any others, how|ever good in them&s;elves, they are unfaithful in their tru&s;t. For example, if a &s;teward is intru&s;ted with money by his lord, to give to particular poor per&s;ons by name, or to the poor of &s;uch a pari&s;h; and he neglects the&s;e, to relieve other per&s;ons, tho' equally nece&s;&s;itous he mi&s;applies the money, and abu&s;es his tru&s;t; Much more &s;o, if in&s;tead of be&s;towing it on <HI>any</HI> of the poor, he employs it in building and decorating an hou&s;e <HI>for him&s;elf,</HI> and in adorning his wife, mi&s;&s;es or children.</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT the Society have applied a great part of the money intru&s;ted with them, to other, and to &s;ay the lea&s;t, much le&s;s noble purpo&s;es than tho&s;e for which it was committed to them, has, if I mi&s;take not, been &s;ufficiently proved.</P>

<P>THIS is often mentioned in the <HI>Ab&s;tracts</HI>; and has not &s;eldom &s;erved as a theme for popular declamation in the anniver&s;ary &s;ermons. Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> has quoted, or at lea&s;t pretended to quote, &s;everal of tho&s;e &s;ermons to this pur|po&s;e. I have compared but one of the&s;e quo|tations with the text it&s;elf; that from the bp. of St. David's &s;ermon; (<HI>Con&s;id.</HI> p. 15.) In which &s;hort quotation of but eight lines, there are three or four deviations from the u&s;ual way of quot|ing. Some of his own words are in&s;erted as the words of the &s;ermon; clau&s;es are left out, and parts of &s;entences at the di&s;tance of 13 pages in quarto are tacked together, and pointed as they ought to have been, if they had been con|tiguous in the &s;ermon; tho' the pages from whence they are taken, are indeed referred to in the margin. How he has u&s;ed &s;ome other au|thors from whom he quotes; and even that great Prelate who "pre&s;ides over the church of Eng|land, <HI>and the Society it&s;elf,</HI>" I have not thought it worth while to examine. He has not indeed mi&s;repre&s;ented the &s;en&s;e of the bp. of St. David's &s;ermon; and perhaps not that of other bps, &amp;c.
<PB N="144" REF="009441_0142_0F748DF7EDA29E00">as to this point. For I know it is a u&s;ual thing for the preachers before the Society to talk in the &s;ame &s;train, about <Q>remedying in the fir&s;t place, <HI>the ill &s;tate of religion in our colonies them&s;elves</HI>:</Q> without which care, it is &s;aid, <Q>the conver&s;ion of the neighbouring Savages can hardly be effected;</Q> and the like.</P>
<P>LET it be here ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT all this kind of rea&s;oning &s;uppo&s;es, that one principal object of the Society, is, the conver&s;ion of the Savages; and &s;o does not well harmonize with what Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;ays el&s;e|where, however true in point of fact&mdash; <Q><HI>Indian</HI> conver&s;ions are undertaken by our Society <HI>incidentally,</HI> and as it were <HI>ex abundanti.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. THIS rea&s;oning &s;eems very ju&s;t, when ap|plied to <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the Briti&s;h colonies, and the mi&s;&s;ions in them; <HI>viz.</HI> all tho&s;e, the religious, or rather irreligious &s;tate of which, an&s;wers to the repre&s;entations in the charter;&mdash;tho&s;e colo|nies in which no tolerable provi&s;ion was before made for mini&s;ters;&mdash;in which the people &s;eem|ed abandoned to athei&s;m and infidelity, or in danger of being perverted to popery, for want of the admini&s;tration of God's word and &s;acra|ments. Sending mi&s;&s;ionaries to &s;uch places as the&s;e, is doubtle&s;s one proper means of propa|gating Chri&s;tianity among the heathen. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. NOTHING can well be le&s;s to the purpo&s;e than this kind of rea&s;oning, when applied to the far greater part of N. England, where the pub|lick wor&s;hip of God was &s;o regularly upheld,
<PB N="145" REF="009441_0143_0F748DF7FA3FE938">and the people <Q>had the means of religion al|ready, in other <HI>prote&s;tant communions.</HI></Q> Such expre&s;&s;ions as tho&s;e, of <HI>remedying the ill &s;tate of religion in the colonies,</HI> and the like; when ap|plied to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut, can naturally import nothing more than reducing us to an outward <HI>uniformity</HI> of profe&s;&s;ion, or converting us to epi&s;copacy and the liturgy. But &s;uppo&s;ing this to be done, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ee how it would contribute much to the con|ver&s;ion of the Indians. Nay, if we con&s;ider what has been done hitherto to this end, by episcopalians and pre&s;byterians, &amp;c. re&s;pec|tively; there is great rea&s;on to think that our conver&s;ion to the church of England would rather retard than promote the conver&s;ion of the Savages. And it is intimated even in &s;ome of the anniver&s;ary &s;ermons before the Society, that the people of New-England had <HI>provoked them to jealou&s;y</HI> in this re&s;pect; tho' hitherto, to very little purpo&s;e. Thus particularly bi&s;hop BURNET &s;ays, <Q>Let tho&s;e who have a true zeal for the honor of <HI>our church,</HI> contribute to rai&s;e her glory, which hitherto has been <HI>too little advanced this way,</HI> while tho&s;e who <HI>divide from us in</HI> NEW-ENGLAND, &s;eem to have provok'd us to <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> on this ac|count.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sermon before the Soc. p. 27.</NOTE> Similar conce&s;&s;ions to our honor, might be produced from other anniver&s;ary &s;ermons.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="146" REF="009441_0144_0F748DF8D3882AF8">4. As the conver&s;ion of the heathen was from the fir&s;t one profe&s;&s;ed aim of our Fore|fathers in &s;ettling in New-England; &s;o almo&s;t all the royal charters, grants, letters patent, and acts of government in England, relative to this country, have made mention of, and encouraged, yea, enjoined upon us the pro|&s;ecution of this pious de&s;ign; not con&s;idered as epi&s;copalians, but as known di&s;&s;enters from the Engli&s;h church. To which purpo&s;e is the following pa&s;&s;age in the charter of this province, granted in the 12th of WILLIAM and MARY; the year before the Society's carter &mdash; <Q>To di&s;po&s;e of matters and things whereby our &s;ubjects, inhabitants of our &s;aid province, may be religiou&s;ly, peacea|bly and civily governed, protected and de|fended; &s;o as their good life, and orderly conver&s;ation may win the <HI>Indians,</HI> natives of the country, to the knowledge and obe|dience of the only true God and Saviour of mankind, and the Chri&s;tian faith; which his royal Maje&s;ty our royal Grandfather K.

<P N="5">5. CAN it be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that King WILLIAM, in the Society's charter granted the year after this, had the lea&s;t thoughts of
<PB N="147" REF="009441_0145_0F748DF975A57D70">impowering them to employ a great part of their fund in converting Us to epi&s;copacy, and uniformity in wor&s;hip, either as one <HI>end</HI> of their in&s;titution, or as requi&s;ite <HI>means</HI> of con|verting the Indians;&mdash;a pious work all along recommended to, and enjoined upon the inha|bitants of New-England them&s;elves! The royal charters, letters patent, grants, &amp;c. &s;up|po&s;e the &s;ettlers and inhabitants of this coun|try, tho' not epi&s;copalians, to have been a re|ligious people, who were di&s;po&s;ed and quali|fied to &s;erve the intere&s;ts of religion, by chri&s;|tianizing the Indians. But it &s;eems Mr. <HI>Ap|thorp,</HI> not to &s;ay, the Society, think that, in|&s;tead of confining their pious care to the hea|theni&s;h colonies, or applying them&s;elves di|rectly to the Indians, they are to employ a great part of their fund in converting US to the liturgy, as a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary means</HI> of converting the Savages. Is this &s;uch a method of ju&s;tifying the New-England mi&s;&s;ions, as mu&s;t needs "convince the candid?"&mdash;<HI>confute</HI> all but the "ob&s;tinate," and <HI>&s;ilence</HI> all but the "malici|ous!"</P>

<PB N="148" REF="009441_0146_0F748DFA985AB9D8">religious &s;tate no ways an&s;wers to the de&s;crip|tions in the charter; to the neglect of other colonies, and the heathen them&s;elves, the di|rect, proper objects of their charity. Colonies who&s;e religious &s;tate is like that of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets and Connecticut, are implicitly exclu|ded from any &s;hare in this charity, by the re|pre&s;entations given in the charter, of tho&s;e for which it was de&s;igned, &s;o widely different therefrom. And to bring in the&s;e New-Eng|land mi&s;&s;ions and mi&s;&s;ionaries thus <HI>indirectly,</HI> or <HI>edge-ways,</HI> as a pretended <HI>means</HI> of converting the Savages, when they cannot be ju&s;tified <HI>di|rectly,</HI> by the expre&s;s, obvious de&s;ign of the charter; is no better than an eva&s;ion; and one that naturally brings to mind tho&s;e words of the CHIEF SHEPHERD, &s;o often mi&s;appli|ed by epi&s;copalians&mdash;<Q>He that entereth not <HI>by the door,</HI> into the &s;heepfold, but climbeth up <HI>&s;ome other way,</HI> the &s;ame is a thief and a robber.</Q>&mdash;Tho' I do not mean to call the Society's mi&s;&s;ionaries among us, by tho&s;e op|probrious names; or to give them any per&s;o|nal affront.

<P N="7">7. IF it &s;hould be &s;aid, that <HI>any means</HI> which have even a remote tendency to the conver|&s;ion of the Indians, may be u&s;ed by the So|ciety to that <HI>end,</HI> by virtue of their "large di&s;cretionary power;" and if it is upon this footing that the mi&s;&s;ions here are ju&s;tified, let us con&s;ider how far the &s;ame way of rea|&s;oning might carry them, and where it would
<PB N="149" REF="009441_0147_0F748DFB1FD3DB90">end. They think our conver&s;ion to epi&s;copa|cy a means of converting the Indians. They are therefore, in pur&s;uance of the maxim a|fore&s;aid, right in maintaining mi&s;&s;ions here at a great annual expence, with the hopes of thru&s;ting in the &s;ickle, and reaping a mighty Indian harve&s;t a century or two hence, when it is ripened by means of the benign influences of epi&s;copacy upon New-England. Neither I, indeed, nor probably the reader, can &s;ee how this &s;uppo&s;ed means tends to the propo|&s;ed end. It &s;eems a round-about, aukward way of going to work: But no matter; the Society judge it proper, and that is &s;ufficient. Let us then proceed one &s;tep farther. If the church of Scotland, for which WE have gene|rally a great veneration, was but fir&s;t <HI>epi&s;copized</HI>; this might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome remote tenden|cy to induce us to conform to the church of England; and therefore a tendency, accor|ding to the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, tho' more re|mote, to convert the Indians. NOW, if it &s;hould appear thus to the Society, they may, according to the maxim afore&s;aid, &s;end mi&s;|&s;ionaries to convert the kirk, in order to the conver&s;ion of New-England; and this in or|der to convert the Savages on our frontiers. With the &s;ame pious de&s;ign, they might al&s;o &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries into Holland, Geneva, the Swi&s;s Cantons, &amp;c. For though the charter &s;ays nothing of Scotland, Holland, Geneva, Switzerland, or even of New-England, but
<PB N="150" REF="009441_0148_0F748DFBB6F1BC20">implicitly excludes them all from the charita|ble care of the Society; yet the Society, it is &s;aid, have a <HI>large di&s;cretionary power,&mdash;even oc|ca&s;ionally to make alterations in their in&s;titution, in &s;uch a manner as to render it mo&s;t beneficial to re|ligion, whether in our colonies, or among the bor|dering nations.</HI>&mdash;Who then can doubt the right of the Society to maintain mi&s;&s;ions in all the prote&s;tant countries of Europe, to promote the peculiarities of the church of England, in or|der to the e&s;tabli&s;hing of epi&s;copacy and uni|formity among us; and to <HI>remedy the ill &s;tate of religion here,</HI> without which, <Q>the conver|&s;ion of the neighbouring Savages can hard|ly be effected!</Q> &mdash; NOW, where Mr. <HI>Ap|thorp</HI>'s method of rea&s;oning, joined with &s;uch an <HI>imagination,</HI> may end, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay; except perhaps in the Society's appointing proper per&s;ons to look out for &s;ome Gee&s;e of the breed of GONSALES, to carry mi&s;&s;ionaries to the moon, in order to convert the <HI>good man</HI> there to the church, in order to his com|ing as an apo&s;tle to convert us; and all this as a <HI>means</HI> of converting the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> &amp;c. And indeed, con&s;idering how &s;criptural our religi|on is at pre&s;ent; and how unlikely we are to better our&s;elves by &s;o great a change, either on temporal or &s;piritual accounts; it may be hoped that we &s;hall not be generally epi&s;copi|zed in a long time, unle&s;s that officious pla|net, at lea&s;t by &s;ome &s;ecret and powerful <HI>influ|ence,</HI> &s;hould have a con&s;iderable hand in the apo&s;tolical work of our conver&s;ion.</P>

Con&s;idering the force of prejudice, what in every one's judgment holds the <HI>&s;econd place,</HI> may be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;erve the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></Q> The ingenious gentleman adds, that <Q>for this ob|&s;ervation, <HI>as far as be can recollect,</HI> he is in|debted to a <HI>fine writer,</HI> Dr. JOHN BROWN</Q>&mdash; Be that as it may, I can give a gue&s;s from whence it came originally; <HI>viz.</HI> from another learned Divine of the church of England; I mean Dr. SWIFT.

That by the <HI>Ce&s;&s;ion of Canada,</HI> &amp;c. there is now a noble <HI>Pro&s;pect</HI> of much being done towards chri&s;tianizing the <HI>Indians,</HI> provided this <HI>good Work</HI> is heartily and di&s;cretely pro&s;ecuted.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is pa&s;t cannot be recalled, or undone: But abu&s;es may be refor|med, if the authors &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of them, and not <HI>above</HI> altering their mea&s;ures.

The&s;e circum&s;tances, of &s;uch great importance to the pro&s;perity of the Briti&s;h colonies, and to Great-Britain her&s;elf, may well be con&s;idered as a loud <HI>call of pro|vidence</HI> to her and them, to engage heartily in the bu&s;ine&s;s of chri&s;tianizing the Natives: And the religious obligation hereto, increa&s;es in proportion to the pro&s;pect, or probability of &s;ucce&s;s in the attempt; as was hinted before.</P>

Of the <HI>political</HI> Rea&s;ons <HI>&s;till remaining,</HI> for endeavouring to chri&s;tianize the <HI>Indians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOME people may perhaps imagine, that &s;ince the ce&s;&s;ion of Canada, &amp;c. there are no motives or rea&s;ons be&s;ides merely <HI>reli|gious</HI> ones, to attempt the civilizing and convert|ing the American Indians. That the <HI>politi|cal</HI> ones which before &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, are <HI>le&s;&s;ened</HI> in &s;ome degree, is not denied; but, that they are wholly <HI>cea&s;ed,</HI> no one who duly con&s;iders the matter, can &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay nothing of the benefits that might re|&s;ult herefrom to the agriculture, fi&s;hery and na|vigation of the colonies, and to the Briti&s;h com|merce, even upon &s;uppo&s;ition that there was not a je&s;uit, popi&s;h prie&s;t, emi&s;&s;ary, or one Frenchman upon this continent; it is to be remembred, that <HI>human affairs</HI> are &s;ubject to great changes and revolutions, as we have lately &s;een, particularly in America. We cannot be <HI>certain</HI> that others may not take place hereafter, almo&s;t as much to our prejudice, as tho&s;e are to our advantage. At lea&s;t, human prudence re|quires that every thing of that &s;ort &s;hould be guarded again&s;t, as far as human fore&s;ight and power can do it. And one means hereof doubt|le&s;s is, u&s;ing the pre&s;ent opportunity of &s;pread|ing, as far as may be, the Chri&s;tian, prote&s;tant religion among the Natives; and thereby engag|ing
<PB N="165" REF="009441_0163_0F748E07C71C1D38">them <HI>heartily</HI> in the Briti&s;h intere&s;t, in op|po&s;ition to the French.</P>
<P>THE French are a very powerful and politic, ambitious and enterpri&s;ing nation: They do not long &s;it down ea&s;y under <HI>great lo&s;&s;es</HI>; and they &s;oon recover them&s;elves by peace, after being exhau&s;ted by war. In all probability, they will continue to carry on intrigues with the Indians of Canada, and on the Ea&s;t of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, by means of their emi&s;&s;aries, to the prejudice of our colonies; not without hopes of finding their ends in it at le&s;t&mdash;The reverend and learned EDWARD WIGGLESWORTH, D. D. HOLLI|SIAN <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">N. B. This <HI>Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip</HI> was in great part endow'd by the worthy Mr. THOMAS HOLLIS of London, &s;ome time &s;ince decea&s;ed; a very generous benefactor to our College. The pre&s;ent worthy THOMAS HOLLIS of London, <HI>E&s;q</HI> F. R. S. &amp;c. has al&s;o, more than once, pre&s;ented &s;ome valua|ble books to the library of &s;aid College.</NOTE> Profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Harvard College in Cambridge, who has thought much and long on the affair of the mi&s;&s;ions and the Indians, has obliged me with two or three letters &s;ince I have been writing on this &s;ubject. In one of them (which I obtained his leave to make u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion) he &s;peaks particularly of what has la&s;t been hinted at. And, I conceive, the be&s;t u&s;e I can make of it, is to give the pub|lic the &s;ub&s;tance of it in the Doctor's <HI>own words,</HI> as follows.</P>
<P>&mdash;<Q>Probably it may now be generally thought, that &s;ince Canada is reduced, nothing more is to be apprehended from the Indians; but that we &s;hall live in perpetual peace and good neighbourhood with them. Tho' it may be thought a weakne&s;s, I mu&s;t own, that I entertain very different apprehen&s;ions. I
<PB N="166" REF="009441_0164_0F748E08798259E0">believe that the French, in &s;pite of all precau|tions that can be taken, will continue mi&s;&s;ion|aries among all tho&s;e tribes of Indians, who have been u&s;ed to have them; and will thru&s;t them into as many others as they po&s;&s;ibly can. One great bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e will be, to keep up a &s;trong di&s;affection to the Engli&s;h in the Savages, in hopes of making u&s;e of them, at &s;ome future favourable conjuncture, to di&s;|tre&s;s our provinces again, and recover their own lo&s;&s;es. To an&s;wer &s;uch an end, the French mi&s;&s;ionaries will make no difficulty to dre&s;s and paint like Savages, and pa&s;s for as very Indians as any of them, even in vi&s;its to our &s;orts and frontier towns. And I know of nothing that can prevent &s;uch mi&s;manage|ments, but our having mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Indians, who &s;hall be <HI>men of genius enough to gain their e&s;teem,</HI> and <HI>the &s;ame a&s;cendency over them,</HI> which the French mi&s;&s;ionaries get, wherever they come.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IF any &s;hould be &s;o &s;anguine as to flatter them&s;elves, that we &s;hall never again have <HI>a weak admini&s;tration at home,</HI> which may encourage the French to attempt to recover what they have lo&s;t in America; yet we have found by experience, when Mr. DUMMER commanded in chief, that by je&s;uitical influ|ence the Indians may be &s;pirited to make war upon us, even when the French <HI>dare not ap|pear</HI> to help or abet them. And if that war had not been conducted in a manner very different from the conduct of any other war we have ever had with our Ea&s;tern tribes of
<PB N="167" REF="009441_0165_0F748E09C7D89F08">Indians, before or &s;ince; they would have been no more humbled then, than they u&s;ed to be at other times; but might have con|tinued to hara&s;s our borders, till we had been much more weary of the war than they. And if any tribes of Indians now &s;hould be &s;et on, by &s;ecret French emi&s;&s;aries among them, to ravage our new &s;ettlements, and murder the inhabitants; I &s;u&s;pect they might <HI>live better by it than by hunting</HI>: And they might [perhaps] be better &s;upplied with all they want, except money for our &s;calps, <HI>by &s;uch Engli&s;h provinces as they were plea&s;ed not to mole&s;t,</HI> than they ever were by the French in Canada.</Q></P>
<P>THE preceeding extract is given, not only as very clearly and preci&s;ely expre&s;&s;ing my own apprehen&s;ions; but becau&s;e it is naturally con|cluded, that coming from an <HI>aged</HI> gentleman, of &s;o &s;uperior and re&s;pectable a character as Dr. WIGGLESWORTH, it will have a greater attention paid to it, than the &s;ame things coming only from my&s;elf could have claimed. Let me add; It is undoubted fact, that in &s;ome of our French and Indian wars, the Savages have been &s;upplied even with <HI>ammunition</HI> from one or more of the Briti&s;h colonies: And it has been reported, I believe truly, that the cloaths of &s;ome of our people, butchered by them, have been very <HI>amicably</HI> &s;old at Albany, <HI>with the blood upon them</HI>&mdash;In a word, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of having a con&s;iderable number of mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Indians, is &s;o apparent and urgent, in a political, as well as religious

And tho' it has not been thought needful to follow him &s;tep by &s;tep; yet, I flat|ter my&s;elf, enough has been &s;aid to convince the impartial, that tho&s;e <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI> were both written and publi&s;hed with far too little <HI>con&s;ideration.</HI> He began his triumph, however, or rather in&s;ult, in the title-page, by a long, &s;cornful, mo&s;t contemptuous <HI>motto</HI>; in which he intimates, how much beneath him he thought it to enter the li&s;ts with any per&s;on, who was &s;o hardy as to object again&s;t the Society; reproach|ing them all, in effect, as vain, impudent liars&mdash; "Vanos continu&ograve; ac mendaces e&s;&s;e"&mdash;This <HI>revi|ling</HI> motto, which &s;erves him as an <HI>exordium,</HI> is from the <HI>Evangelical Preparation</HI> of EUSEBIUS:
<PB N="169" REF="009441_0167_0F748E0AB4BCCF08">And on the other &s;ide of the &s;ame leaf are adver|tized, "SERMONS on PRAYER, with FORMS of "DEVOTION": which we may charitably &s;uppo&s;e de&s;igned for <HI>general</HI> u&s;e;&mdash;both for tho&s;e who had <HI>devotion</HI> before, without much <HI>formality</HI>; and tho&s;e who had <HI>formality</HI> enough before, without much <HI>devotion.</HI> Next appears his <HI>humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> of his defence, to the "judgment and deci&s;ion" of his venerable <HI>Clients,</HI> the Society, of which he is him&s;elf a <HI>member.</HI> In the fir&s;t page, (numbered 7) he propo&s;es a que&s;tion that is hardly intelligi|ble; &s;peaks of it as very "intere&s;ting", and <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> expre&s;&s;es his intention to determine it "<HI>once for all</HI>"&mdash;And this, without <Q>the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> intention of offence or <HI>controver&s;y</HI></Q>, (p. 8.) He al&s;o &s;ays there, <Q>The propo&s;ed vindication is de&s;igned to convince the <HI>candid.</HI> To confute the <HI>ob&s;tinate,</HI> and &s;ilence the <HI>malicious,</HI> is not in the <HI>power of rea&s;on.</HI></Q> But, by the way, I have always &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>ob&s;tinate</HI> were as capable of being <HI>confuted</HI> by the <HI>power of rea&s;on,</HI> as others; tho' much more hard to be <HI>convinced,</HI> or put to <HI>&s;ilence</HI>: And I hope that this gentle|man will never &s;erve as an example, to &s;hew the wide difference betwixt the&s;e things, which he now &s;eems to con&s;ider as the &s;ame. But be that as it may,
<Q>"Quid dignum tanto feret hic PROMISSOR hiatu!"</Q></P>
<P>IT appears that he was put upon this <HI>de&s;perate</HI> undertaking, by &s;omething which, it &s;eems, hid offended him in a news-paper, relative to the mi&s;&s;ions. And p. 9. he threatens the unknown author of a &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;ult on the <HI>dead,</HI> with
<PB N="170" REF="009441_0168_0F748E0CEB1E0E30">in&s;tant de&s;truction from his powerful quill; &s;ay|ing with the old Trojan Hero,
<Q><L><HI>Extinxi&s;&s;e</HI> nefas &mdash;, et &s;ump&s;i&s;&s;e merentis</L>
<L><HI>Laudabor</HI> poenas&mdash;</L></Q>
Con&s;idering the <HI>occa&s;ion,</HI> I wonder he did not adopt the next words al&s;o&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash; Animumg; exple&s;&s;e juvabit</L>
<L><HI>Ultricis</HI> flammae, et <HI>cineres</HI> &s;atia&s;&s;e meorum.</L></Q>
And the following line may perhaps be proper for a motto for him, if he &s;hould again write on the &s;ubject: <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>Talia <HI>jactabam,</HI> et <HI>furiat&acirc;</HI> mente ferebar.</Q>
But as he was to determine the matter <HI>once for all,</HI> this is not to be expected.</P>
<P>FROM the 9th to the 18th p. we find him chiefly employed, fir&s;t in <HI>mi&s;quoting,</HI> and then in <HI>mi&s;repre&s;enting</HI> the charter; in putting in an exclu&s;ive claim to <HI>orthodoxy</HI> for the clergy of the church of England; making the Society <HI>&s;tewards</HI> and &s;overeign <HI>proprietors,</HI> in the &s;ame breath; reproaching others with "great ignorance, or &s;omething <HI>wor&s;e</HI>"; reviling the religion of our Forefathers in the mo&s;t opprobrious terms; and &s;hewing how <HI>greatly</HI> our reformation in religi|on,&mdash;without the improvement of our <HI>morals</HI> or <HI>piety,</HI> is <HI>the work of the Society.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus prepared the way, he propo&s;es (p. 18.) <Q>to take leave of this popular objection [again&s;t the Society] with <HI>&s;o full a confutation,</HI> that it will be <HI>di&s;ingenuous</HI> ever to advance it again.</Q> How is that to be done?&mdash;Why, by <Q><HI>confidently</HI> re&s;ting his <HI>proof</HI> on the unexceptio|nable <HI>te&s;timony</HI> of two&mdash;<HI>Prelates</HI></Q>&mdash;; both of
<PB N="171" REF="009441_0169_0F748E0D5D66AC20">them members of the Society&mdash;Let us &s;ee how many <HI>metamorpho&s;es</HI> they have already pa&s;t thro'; 1&s;t. they were <HI>Clients,</HI> 2dly. <HI>Judges,</HI> 3dly. they are <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI>; and all in the &s;ame cau&s;e, <HI>their own.</HI> But then, they are mo&s;t <HI>unexceptionable</HI> Witne&s;&s;es&mdash;<Q>incapable either of <HI>mi&s;take</HI> or <HI>mi&s;re|pre&s;entation</HI> in a matter &s;o thoroughly known to them.</Q> And (p. 19) he &s;peaks of the "in|vincible rea&s;ons" of one of them. So that Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s fruitful imagination has produc|ed another <HI>metamorpho&s;is.</HI> It &s;eems they are now neither <HI>Clients, Judges,</HI> nor <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI>; but, 4ly. <HI>Rea&s;oners,</HI> pleading their own cau&s;e. What they &s;ay, whether called their <HI>te&s;timony</HI> or their <HI>rea&s;oning,</HI> has been taken notice of; and others may think for them&s;elves, whether it is <HI>unan|&s;werable</HI> and <HI>invincible,</HI> or not.</P>
<P>PAGE 23. Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> as well he might, makes an <Q>apology for his undertaking to vin|dicate a Society, which is <HI>above cen&s;ure,</HI> as it is <HI>incapable of wrong motives.</HI></Q>&mdash;An extraordinary Society indeed! And &s;urely &s;ome <HI>apology</HI> was needed for officiou&s;ly undertaking the defence of a Society &s;o <HI>incapable</HI> of erring. So that he has, in effect, infallible Clients, infallible Judges, infallible Witne&s;&s;es, and infallible Rea&s;oners; all on the &s;ame &s;ide with his own infallible <HI>Self,</HI> and all in the <HI>&s;ame per&s;ons</HI>! Did ever any man under|take a more <HI>needle&s;s</HI> work! He &s;eems indeed to repent; and <Q>promi&s;es, in amends, to employ his <HI>&s;tudies,</HI> for the future, <HI>to better purpo&s;es,</HI></Q> (p. 23.) Upon which <HI>condition,</HI> I think he ought to be <HI>forgiven</HI>; and, all things con&s;idered, I know
<PB N="172" REF="009441_0170_0F748E0E797A3008">of none &s;o <HI>unlikely</HI> to overlook his officious error, <HI>as the Society them&s;elves</HI>&mdash;But it would &s;eem hard, not to &s;hew &s;ome lenity to him; e&s;pecially if, as he there &s;ays, <Q>This bu&s;ine&s;s, in truth, was <HI>forced</HI> upon him</Q>&mdash;In &s;uch a ca&s;e, who&s;e <HI>&s;tars</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly <HI>prevent their writing</HI>; if they will but make the &s;ad ca&s;e their own! This <HI>force,</HI> it &s;eems, was chiefly put upon him by a Braintree gentle|man, who, as he &s;uppo&s;es, had in&s;ulted the memory of a decea&s;ed mi&s;&s;ionary; and <Q>by the honor <HI>done him</HI> of <HI>&s;haring</HI> in the in&s;ult</Q>; as he has accurately expre&s;&s;ed it. He is very &s;evere on the &s;aid Braintree gentleman: Whom, however, I &s;hould think almo&s;t as <HI>inhuman</HI> and <HI>barbarous</HI> as he has been repre&s;ented, if he de&s;ired any &s;everer revenge on Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> than that <HI>he &s;hould write more</HI> SUCH CONSIDERATIONS and DE|FENCES.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> then pa&s;&s;es &s;ome other <HI>compliments</HI> of a pretty <HI>extraordinary nature,</HI> however ju&s;t, on the Society, <Q>the honor of our age and nati|on,</Q> &amp;c. The&s;e might po&s;&s;ibly, however, have come from &s;ome <HI>other per&s;on</HI> with as good a grace, as from a <HI>member</HI> of the Society; accord|ing to that old maxim, <Q>Let another prai&s;e thee, and <HI>not thine own mouth.</HI></Q> He then gives it as his opinion, that the Society <Q>cannot better apply their munificence than in providing, <HI>throughout our colonies,</HI> for the <HI>decent</HI> celebra|tion of public religion</Q>. By which, accord|ing to his whole argument, he mu&s;t mean plant|ing <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> churches even in tho&s;e colonies, where the people <Q>have the means of religion
<PB N="173" REF="009441_0171_0F748E0F374EEB98">already, in <HI>other prote&s;tant communions</HI></Q>. And who can doubt, but that this is a better way of <HI>applying their munificence,</HI> than &s;ending mi&s;&s;iona|ries to the heathens, or only to the heatheni&s;h colonies, almo&s;t <Q>abandoned to athei&s;m and infidelity!</Q></P>
<P>IN the la&s;t page, however, he talks in a rap|turous &s;train about <Q>beholding this exten&s;ive country, ju&s;t won to the Briti&s;h empire, <HI>gra|dually acceding,</HI> AMONG <HI>its numerous inhabi|tants,</HI> to the empire of JESUS CHRIST, and of con&s;equence, flouri&s;hing in ARTS, in SCI|ENCE</Q>, &amp;c. The arts and &s;ciences are indeed very valuable in their places; tho' they do not &s;eem to be AMONG the primary or principal of tho&s;e important ble&s;&s;ings, which flow from the knowledge and obedience of JESUS CHRIST. However, they are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. And who can doubt, but that they will be as much improved by the mi&s;&s;ion of &s;o accompli&s;h'd a Scholar as Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> in the confines of our <HI>College,</HI> as the religious &s;tate of the country has been amended by the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ions in gene|ral? This was perhaps one de&s;ign of the cha|ritable Society therein; that &s;o the advancement of <HI>learning</HI> among us, may in time be as <HI>greatly their work,</HI> as the reformation of our religion is at pre&s;ent: I would hope, much more &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>AFTER quoting &s;omething on this noble oc|ca&s;ion from VIRGIL, Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> concludes with &s;ome fine lines from Mr. POPE's MESSI|AH: Tho' if he had either mentioned POPE's name, or mark'd them as a quotation, he might
<PB N="174" REF="009441_0172_0F748E10119F9CA8">perhaps at once have been thought le&s;s a <HI>poet</HI> by the common people, and given ill-natur'd critics le&s;s occa&s;ion to tax him as a <HI>plagiary.</HI> Not that I my&s;elf in the lea&s;t doubt his poetical talents. For even in this <HI>didactic</HI> performance, he has obliged us with many &s;pecimens of a &s;in|gular imagination, a florid, rhetorical diction, a bri&s;k, lively way of rea&s;oning, marvellous turns of argument, &s;urpri&s;ing hyperboles, and divers other <HI>licences</HI> even in grammar, truly poetical: Nay, he has altered, not to &s;ay <HI>corrected</HI> two of the&s;e lines from POPE!
<Q>[Dum mal&egrave; recitas, incipit e&s;&s;e <HI>tuum</HI> &mdash;]</Q></P>
<P>NOW, from a gentleman who&s;e pro&s;aic, ar|gumentative compo&s;itions are &s;o agreeably <HI>be|mu&s;ed,</HI> what might not be expected, if he were to write poetry <HI>in earne&s;t</HI>!&mdash;But it may be doubted whether he will be able to &s;pare time from his more important concerns, to oblige the world in this way; e&s;pecially if, as &s;ome of late &s;uppo&s;e,
<Q>&mdash;his reverend mind Begins to grow <HI>right-rev'rendly</HI> inclin'd</Q>&mdash;</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER Any may imagine, the author of the fore|going <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly declares, that he heartily wi&s;h|es Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> well; happy here and hereafter. And if the&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;hould contribute any thing towards <HI>&s;hewing him to him&s;elf,</HI> this will not tend to ob&s;truct, but to promote that benevolent end&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT the main end which he had in view, was much more exten&s;ive, general and important;&mdash;that of &s;erving the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, of pure and undefil|ed religion in America; in di&s;tinction from all private, party-opinions what&s;oever. He is very far from making
<PB N="175" REF="009441_0173_0F748E10E7D5EBF8">any preten&s;ions to an exemption from mi&s;takes. But as to his &s;incerity, and the uprightne&s;s of his intentions; if it were expedient to make prote&s;tations in &s;uch ca&s;es, he could very chearfully appeal to that tribunal, at which ALL are finally to appear.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING he is in principle and profe&s;&s;ion an anti-epi&s;copalian; yet he &s;incerely loves and honors all virtuous, candid and moderate men of all denominations among Chri&s;tians; by no means excepting tho&s;e of the epi&s;copal communion; with &s;everal of whom he has a per&s;onal and agreeable acquaintance, which he would be glad to keep up: Nor would he willingly and unnece&s;|&s;arily give offence to any per&s;ons of that per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>THO' he wi&s;hes the people of New-England to &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith CHRIST hath made them free; and not to return under that yoke of epi&s;copal bondage, which &s;o mi&s;erably galled the necks of our Forefathers, that they were not able to bear it, and there|fore took refuge in America; yet he is far from de&s;iring to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of any one &s;ect or party again&s;t another: So far from it, that he would &s;incerely rejoice to be in the lea&s;t degree in&s;trumental of uniting them in the bonds of Chri&s;tian charity, on the true plan of the go&s;pel. In order to which, he cannot think an ex|act uniformity either in <HI>&s;entiment,</HI> or in modes of <HI>wor|&s;hip</HI> and <HI>di&s;cipline,</HI> nece&s;&s;ary. The former is im|po&s;&s;ible in this imperfect &s;tate, on divers accounts; and the <HI>latter</HI> not to be expected, unle&s;s in countries where the invaluable ble&s;&s;ing of liberty is &s;acrificed to a far in|ferior object. Zealous attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h an exact uniformity in religion, have generally, if not always proved pernicious to the peace of &s;ociety, to chri&s;tian charity and morals, in a very high degree: All eccle&s;i|a&s;tic hi&s;tory is a proof of this. Such an uniformity and the advancement of the hierarchy, have too apparently been favourite objects with the SOCIETY all along parti|cularly as to New-England; while the heatheni&s;h colo|nies, the poor Negroes and Indians have been proporti|onably
<PB N="176" REF="009441_0174_0F748E117A6F2AE0">neglected. And to what one valuable purpo&s;e? &mdash;unle&s;s cau&s;ing alienation of affections, and animo&s;ities among us, can be accounted &s;uch!&mdash;And the&s;e are the principal fruits which, con&s;idering the religious &s;tate of this country, can in rea&s;on be expected from a continued pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign.</P>
<P>THE author concludes with his humble and earne&s;t prayers, that GOD would unite all the SOCIETIES for the propagation of TRUE RELIGION, whether in England, Scotland or America, in a &s;incere de&s;ire to promote <HI>that alone</HI>; and afford them re&s;pectively &s;uch lights and di|rections as may &s;erve to advance this one, &s;ingle, mo&s;t important end, to his own glory, and the good of man|kind; till in the revolutions of times and &s;ea&s;ons, which He keeps in his own power, <Q>the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM &s;hall be preached for a witne&s;s among ALL NATIONS</Q>; and that grand event &s;hall take place, in praying for which all &s;incere Chri&s;tians are already unit|ed;&mdash;even that HIS KINGDOM may come, and HIS WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN. AMEN!</P>
