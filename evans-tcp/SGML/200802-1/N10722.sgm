<P>MANY of the facts contained in the natural hi&s;tory of medicine among the Indians in the following oration, are taken from La Hontan's and Charlevoix's hi&s;tories of Canada: But the mo&s;t mate|rial of them are taken from per&s;ons who had lived, or travelled among the Indi|ans. The author acknowledges him&s;elf indebted in a particular manner to Mr. Edward Hand, &s;urgeon in the 18th regi|ment, who during &s;everal years re&s;idence at Fort Pitt, directed his enquiries into their cu&s;toms, di&s;ea&s;es, and remedies, with a &s;ucce&s;s that does equal honor to his ingenuity and diligence.</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RISE with peculiar diffidence to addre&s;s you upon this occa&s;ion, when I reflect upon the entertainment you propo&s;ed to your&s;elves from the eloquence of that learned member<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Charles Thomp&s;on.</NOTE>, whom your &s;uffrages appointed to this honor after the delivery of the la&s;t anniver&s;ary orati|on. Unhappy for the intere&s;ts of litera|ture, his want of health has not permit|ted him to comply with your appointment. I beg therefore that you would forget for a while, the abilities nece&s;&s;ary to execute this ta&s;k with propriety, and li&s;ten with candor to the efforts of a member, who&s;e attachment to the &s;ociety, was the only qualification that entitled him to the ho|nor of your choice.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013592_0005_0F914470CCEB1548">THE &s;ubject I have cho&s;en for this evening's entertainment, is <Q>An enquiry into the natural hi&s;tory of medicine among the Indians in North-America, and a comparative view of their di&s;ea&s;es and remedies with tho&s;e of civilized nations.</Q> You will readily anticipate the difficulty of doing ju&s;tice to this &s;ub|ject. How &s;hall we di&s;tingui&s;h between the original di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians and tho&s;e contracted from their intercour&s;e with the Europeans? By what arts &s;hall we per&s;uade them to di&s;cover their reme|dies? and la&s;tly, how &s;hall we come at the knowledge of facts in that cloud of errors, in which the credulity of the Eu|ropeans, and the &s;uper&s;tition of the In|dians have involved both their di&s;ea&s;es and remedies? The&s;e difficulties &s;erve to increa&s;e the importance of our &s;ubject. If I &s;hould not be able to &s;olve them, perhaps I may lead the way to more &s;uc|ce&s;sful endeavors for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHALL fir&s;t limit the tribes of Indians who are to be the objects of this enquiry, to tho&s;e who inhabit that part of North-America which extends from the 30th
<PB N="9" REF="013592_0006_0F91447186B4FAE0">to the 60th degree of latitude. When we exclude the E&s;quimaux, who inhabit the &s;hores of Hud&s;on's bay, we &s;hall find a general re&s;emblance in the color, man|ners, and &s;tate of &s;ociety, among all the tribes of Indians who inhabit that exten|&s;ive tract of country.</P>
<P>CIVILIANS have divided nations into &s;avage, barbarous, and civilized. The &s;avage, live by fi&s;hing and hunting. The barbarous, by pa&s;turage or cattle; and the civilized, by agriculture. Each of the&s;e are connected together in &s;uch a manner that the whole appear to form different parts of a circle. Even the man|ners of the mo&s;t civilized nations partake of tho&s;e of the &s;avage. It would &s;eem as if liberty and indolence were the highe&s;t pur&s;uits of man; and the&s;e are enjoyed in their greate&s;t perfection by &s;avages, or in the practice of cu&s;toms which re&s;emble tho&s;e of &s;avages.</P>
<P>THE Indians of North-America partake chiefly of the manners of &s;avages. In the earlie&s;t accounts we have of them, we find them cultivating a &s;pot of ground.
<PB N="10" REF="013592_0007_0F9144723B8361D0">The maize is an original grain among them. The different di&s;hes of it which are in u&s;e among the white people &s;till retain Indian names.</P>
<P>IT will be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;how that the Indians live in a &s;tate of &s;ociety adapted to all the exigencies of their mode of life. Tho&s;e who look for the &s;implicity and perfection of the &s;tate of nature, mu&s;t &s;eek it in &s;y&s;tems, as ab&s;urd in phi|lo&s;ophy, as they are delightful in poetry.</P>
<P>BEFORE we attempt to a&s;certain the number of hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire in|to tho&s;e cu&s;toms among them which we know influence di&s;ea&s;es. For this pur|po&s;e I &s;hall,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Mention a few facts which relate to the birth and treatment of their chil|dren.</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;hall &s;peak of their diet.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Of the cu&s;toms peculiar to each of the &s;exes. And,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013592_0008_0F9144734F4F5B78">Fourthly, Of tho&s;e cu&s;tom which are common to them both.</P>
<P N="1">I. Of the birth and treatment of their children.</P>
<P>MUCH of the future health of the body depends upon its original &s;tamina. A child born of healthy parents always brings into the world a &s;y&s;tem formed by nature to re&s;i&s;t the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es. The treatment of children among the Indians, tends to &s;ecure this hereditary firmne&s;s of con&s;titution. Their fir&s;t food is their mother's milk. To harden them again&s;t the action of heat and cold (the natural enemies of health and life among the Indians) they are plunged every day in cold water. In order to facilitate their being moved from place to place, and at the &s;ame time, to pre&s;erve their &s;hapes, they are tied to a board, where they lie on their backs for &s;ix, ten, or eighteen months. A child generally &s;ucks its mother till it is two years old, and &s;ome|times longer. It is ea&s;y to conceive how much vigor their bodies mu&s;t acquire from this &s;imple, but whole&s;ome nou|ri&s;hment.
<PB N="12" REF="013592_0009_0F914473C6FE2940">The appetite we &s;ometimes ob&s;erve in children for fle&s;h, is altoge|ther artificial. The peculiar irritability of the &s;y&s;tem in infancy, forbids &s;timu|lating aliment of all kinds. Nature never calls for animal food till &s;he has provided the child with tho&s;e teeth which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to divide it. I &s;hall not under|take to determine how far the whol&s;ome quality of the mother's milk is increa&s;ed by her refu&s;ing the embraces of her hu&s;|band, during the time of giving &s;uck.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE diet of the Indians is of a mixed nature, being partly animal and partly vegetable; their animals are wild and therefore ea&s;y of dige&s;tion. As the Indians are naturally more di&s;po&s;ed to the indolent employment of fi&s;hing than hunting in &s;ummer, &s;o we find them living more upon fi&s;h than land animals, in that &s;ea|&s;on of the year. Their vegetables con&s;i&s;t of roots and fruits, mild in them&s;elves, or capable of being made &s;o by the ac|tion of fire. Altho' the interior parts of our continent abound with &s;alt &s;prings, yet I cannot find that the Indians u&s;ed &s;alt in their diet, till they were in&s;truct|ed
<PB N="13" REF="013592_0010_0F914476D653A320">to do &s;o by the Europeans. The &s;mall quantity of fixed alkali contained in the a&s;hes on which they roa&s;ted their meat, could not add much to its &s;timulating quality. They pre&s;erve their meat from putrefaction, by cutting it into &s;mall pieces, and expo&s;ing it in &s;ummer to the &s;un, and in winter to the fro&s;t. In the one ca&s;e its moi&s;ture is di&s;&s;ipated, and in the other &s;o frozen, that it cannot undergo the putrefactive proce&s;s. In dre&s;&s;ing their meat, they are careful to pre&s;erve its juices. They generally pre|fer it in the form of &s;oops. Hence we find, that among them, the u&s;e of the &s;poon preceded that of the knife and fork. They take the &s;ame pains to pre|&s;erve the juice of their meat when they roa&s;t it, by turning it often. The effi|cacy of this animal juice in di&s;&s;olving meat in the &s;tomach, has not been equal|led by any of tho&s;e &s;auces or liquors, which modern luxury has mixed with it for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Indians have no &s;et time for eat|ing, but obey the gentle appetites of na|ture, as often as they call them. After
<PB N="14" REF="013592_0011_0F914477F7A08638">whole days &s;pent in the cha&s;e or in war, they often commit tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es in eat|ing, to which long ab&s;tinence can not fail of prompting them. It is common to &s;ee them &s;pend three or four hours in &s;atisfying their hunger. This is occa&s;ioned not more by the quantity they eat, than by the pains they take in ma&s;ticating it.</P>
<P N="3">III. WE come now to &s;peak of tho&s;e cu&s;toms which are peculiar to the &s;exes. And, fir&s;t, of tho&s;e which belong to the WOMEN. They are doomed by their hu&s;bands to &s;uch dome&s;tic labor as gives a firmne&s;s to their bodies, bordering up|on the ma&s;culine. Their men&s;es &s;eldom begin to flow before they are eighteen, or twenty years of age, and generally cea&s;e before they are forty. They have them in &s;mall quantities, but at regular inter|vals. They &s;eldom marry till they are above twenty. The con&s;titution has now acquired a vigor, which enables it the better to &s;upport the convul&s;ions of child-bearing. This cu&s;tom likewi&s;e guards again&s;t a premature old age. Doctor
<PB N="15" REF="013592_0012_0F9144784E68FED0">Bancroft a&s;cribes the haggard looks&mdash; the loo&s;e hanging brea&s;ts&mdash;and the pro|minent bellies of the Indian women at Guiana, entirely to their bearing children too early <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Natural hi&s;tory of Guiana.</NOTE>. Where marriages are un|fruitful (which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e) a &s;epa|ration is obtained by means of an ea&s;y di|vorce; &s;o that they are unacquainted with the di&s;quietudes which &s;ometimes ari&s;e from barrenne&s;s. During pregnancy, the women are exempted from the more la|borious parts of their duty&mdash;Hence mi&s;|carriages rarely happen among them. Nature is their only midwife. Their la|bors are &s;hort, and accompanied with lit|tle pain. Each woman is delivered in a private cabbin, without &s;o much as one of her own &s;ex to attend her. After wa&s;h|ing her&s;elf in cold water, &s;he returns in a few days to her u&s;ual employments; &s;o that &s;he knows nothing of tho&s;e accidents which ari&s;e from the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or ill management of midwives, or tho&s;e weak|ne&s;&s;es which ari&s;e from a month's confine|ment in a warm room. It is remarkable that there is hardly a period in the inter|val between the eruption and the cea&s;ing
<PB N="16" REF="013592_0013_0F91447904527DB8">of the men&s;es, in which they are not pregnant, or giving &s;uck. This is the mo&s;t natural &s;tate of the con&s;titution during that interval; and hence we often find it connected with the be&s;t &s;tate of health in the women of civilized nations.</P>
<P>THE cu&s;toms peculiar to the Indian MEN, con&s;i&s;t chiefly in tho&s;e employ|ments which are nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve animal life, and to defend their nation. The&s;e employments are hunting and war, each of which is conducted in a manner that tends to call forth every fibre into exerci&s;e, and to en&s;ure them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible health. In times of plenty and peace, we &s;ee them &s;ome|times ri&s;ing from their beloved indolence, and &s;haking off its influence by the &s;a|lutary exerci&s;es of dancing and &s;wim|ming. The Indian men &s;eldom marry before they are thirty years of age: They no doubt derive con&s;iderable vigor from this cu&s;tom; for while they are &s;ecured by it, from the enervating effects of the premature dalliance of love, they may en&s;ure more certain fruitfulne&s;s to their wives, and entail more certain health
<PB N="17" REF="013592_0014_0F914479C4374110">upon their children. Tacitus de&s;cribes the &s;ame cu&s;tom among the Germans, and attributes to it the &s;ame good effects. <Q>Sera juvenum venus, eoque inexau&s;ta pubertas; nec virgines fe&s;tinantur; ea|dem juventa, &s;imilis proceritas, pares validique mi&s;centur; ac robora paren|tum liberi referunt.</Q> (a)</P>
<P>AMONG the Indian men it is deemed a mark of heroi&s;m to bear the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite pain without complaining; upon this account they early inure them&s;elves to burning part of their bodies with fire, or cutting them with &s;harp in&s;truments. No young man can be admitted to the honors of manhood or war, who has not acquitted him&s;elf well in the&s;e trials of patience and fortitude. It is ea&s;y to con|ceive how much this contributes to give a ten&s;ion to the nervous &s;y&s;tem, which renders it le&s;s &s;ubject to the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">IV. WE come now to &s;peak of tho&s;e cu&s;toms which are common to both &s;ex|es: The&s;e are PAINTING, and the u&s;e of the COLD BATH. The practice of anoint|ing
<PB N="18" REF="013592_0015_0F91447A82E8ACB8">the body with oil is common to the &s;avages of all countries: In warm climates it is &s;aid to promote longevity, by check|ing exce&s;&s;ive per&s;piration. The Indians generally u&s;e bear's grea&s;e mixed with a clay; which bears the greate&s;t re&s;emblance to the color of their &s;kins. This pig|ment &s;erves to le&s;&s;en the &s;en&s;ibility of the extremeties of the nerves: It moreover fortifies them again&s;t the action of tho&s;e exhalations, which we &s;hall mention here|after, as a con&s;iderable &s;ource of their di&s;|ea&s;es. The COLD BATH likewi&s;e fortifies the body, and renders it le&s;s &s;ubject to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which ari&s;e from the extremes and vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold. We &s;hall &s;peak hereafter of the Indian man|ner of u&s;ing it.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of &s;ociety among the Indians excludes the influence of mo&s;t of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;order the body. The turbulent effects of anger are concealed in deep and la&s;ting re&s;entments. Envy and ambition are excluded by their equality of power and property: Nor is it nece&s;|&s;ary that the perfections of the whole &s;ex &s;hould be a&s;cribed to one, to induce them
<PB N="19" REF="013592_0016_0F91447B40D2C508">to marry. <Q>The weakne&s;s of love (&s;ays doctor Adam Smith) which is &s;o much indulged in ages of humanity and po|litene&s;s, is regarded among &s;avages as the mo&s;t unpardonable effeminacy. A young man would think him&s;elf di&s;|graced for ever, if he &s;howed the lea&s;t preference of one woman above another, or did not expre&s;s the mo&s;t compleat indifference, both about the time when, and the per&s;on to whom he was to be married <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Theory of moral &s;entiments.</NOTE>.</Q> Thus are they exempted from tho&s;e violent or la&s;ting di&s;ea&s;es, which accompany the &s;everal &s;tages of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions in both &s;exes among civi|lized nations.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable that there are no de|formed Indians: Some have &s;u&s;pected from this circum&s;tance, that they put their deformed children to death; but nature here acts the part of an unna|tural mother. The &s;everity of the Indi|an manners de&s;troys them. (b)</P>
<P>FROM a review of the cu&s;toms of the Indians, we need not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the
<PB N="20" REF="013592_0017_0F91447CF7DFDD10">&s;tateline&s;s, regularity of features, and dignity of a&s;pect by which they are cha|racterized. Where we ob&s;erve the&s;e among our&s;elves, there is always a pre|&s;umption of their being accompanied with health, and a &s;trong con&s;titution.</P>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed our enquiry into the phy&s;ical cu&s;toms of the Indians, we &s;hall proceed now to enquire into their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>A CELEBRATED profe&s;&s;or of anatomy has a&s;&s;erted, that we could not tell by rea&s;oning a priori, that the body was mortal, &s;o intimately woven with its tex|ture, are the principles of life. Lord Ba|con declares, that the only cau&s;e of death which is natural to man, is that from old age; and complains of the imperfection of phy&s;ic, in not being able to guard the principle of life, until the whole of the oil that feeds it, is con&s;umed. We can|not admit of this propo&s;ition of our noble philo&s;opher. In the inventory of the grave in every country, we find more of the &s;poils of youth and manhood, than of age. This mu&s;t be attributed to moral as well as phy&s;ical cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="013592_0018_0F91447D78B8EB78">WE need only recollect the cu&s;tom among the Indians, of &s;leeping in the open air in a variable climate&mdash;the alternate acti|on of heat and cold upon their bodies, to which the warmth of their cabbins expo&s;es them&mdash;their long marches&mdash;their exce&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e&mdash;their intemperance in eating, to which their long fa&s;ting, and their pub|lic fea&s;ts naturally prompt them: And, la&s;tly, the vicinity of their habitations to the banks of rivers, in order to di&s;cover the empire of di&s;ea&s;es among them in every &s;tage of their lives. They have in vain attempted to elude the general laws of mortality, while their mode of life &s;ubjects them to the&s;e remote, but cer|tain cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>FROM what we know of the action of the&s;e potentiae nocentes upon the human body, it will hardly be nece&s;&s;ary to appeal to facts to determine that FEVERS con&s;titute the only di&s;ea&s;es among the Indians. The&s;e fevers are occa&s;ioned by the &s;en&s;ible and in&s;en&s;ible qualities of the air. Tho&s;e which are produced by cold, are of the inflammatory kind, &s;uch as pleuri&s;ies, peripneumonies, and rheumati&s;ms. Tho&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="013592_0019_0F914480B30324A0">which are produced by the in&s;en&s;ible qualities of the air, or by putrid exhala|tions, &mdash;are intermitting, &mdash;putrid, &mdash;and inflammatory, according as the exhalati|ons are combined with more or le&s;s heat or cold. The DYSENTERY (which is an In|dian di&s;ea&s;e) comes under the cla&s;s of fevers. It is the febris introver&s;a of Dr. Sydenham.</P>
<P>THE Indians are &s;ubject to ANIMAL and VEGETABLE POISONS. The effects of the&s;e upon the body, are in &s;ome degree analogous to the exhalations we have mentioned. When they do not bring on &s;udden death, they produce according to their malignity, either an inflammatory or putrid fever.</P>
<P>THE SMALL POX and the VENEREAL DISEASE were communicated to the In|dians in North-America by the Europeans. Nor can I find that they were ever &s;ubject to the SCURVY. Whether this was obviated by their method of pre&s;erving their fle&s;h, or by their mixing it at all times with vegetables, I &s;hall not undertake to de|termine. Doctor Maclurg a&s;cribes to
<PB N="23" REF="013592_0020_0F914481E35ADB88">fre&s;h meat an anti&s;eptic quality <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Experiments on the bile, and reflexions on the biliary &s;ecretion.</NOTE>. The peculiar cu&s;toms and manners of life among the Indians, &s;eems to have exempt|ed them from the&s;e, as well as all other di&s;|ea&s;es of the fluids. The lepro&s;y&mdash;elephan|tia&s;is &mdash;&s;curvy&mdash;and venereal di&s;ea&s;e, ap|pear to be different modifications of the &s;ame primary di&s;order. The &s;ame cau&s;es produce them in every age and country. They are diver&s;ified like plants by climate and nouri&s;hment. They all &s;prung origi|nally from a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere, and un|whol&s;ome diet: hence we read of their prevailing &s;o much in the middle cen|turies, when the principal parts of Europe were overflowed with water, and the in|habitants lived entirely on fi&s;h, and a few unwhol&s;ome vegetables. The abolition of the feudal &s;y&s;tem in Europe by introduc|ing freedom, introduced at the &s;ame time agriculture; which by multiplying the fruits of the earth, le&s;&s;ened the con&s;ump|tion of animal food, and thus put a &s;top to the&s;e di&s;orders. The elephantia&s;is is al|mo&s;t unknown in Europe. The lepro&s;y is confined chiefly to the low countries of Africa. The plica polonica once &s;o com|mon
<PB N="24" REF="013592_0021_0F91448202813C40">in Poland is to be found only in books of medicine. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e will probably in a few years cea&s;e to be a tax upon unlawful embraces. The &s;mall pox is no longer a fatal di&s;order, when the body is prepared for its reception, by a vege|table regimen. Even the plague it&s;elf is lo&s;ing its &s;ting. It is hardly dreaded at this time in Turky; and its very exi&s;t|ence is pre&s;erved there by the doctrine of fatali&s;m, which prevails among the inhabitants of that country. It may &s;erve as a new and powerful motive again&s;t political &s;lavery to perceive, that it is connected with tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which mo&s;t deform and deba&s;e the human body. It may likewi&s;e &s;erve to enhance the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, to trace its effects, in eradicating &s;uch loath&s;ome and de&s;tructive di&s;orders. (c)</P>
<P>I HAVE heard of two or three ca&s;es of the GOUT among the Indians, but it was only among tho&s;e who had learned the u&s;e of rum, from the white people. A que&s;tion naturally occurs here, and that is; why does not the gout appear more frequently among that cla&s;s of people,
<PB N="25" REF="013592_0022_0F914482C9653278">who con&s;ume the greate&s;t quantity of rum among our&s;elves? To this I an&s;wer, that the effects of this liquor upon tho&s;e enfeebled people, are too &s;udden and violent, to admit of their being thrown upon the extremities; as we know them to be among the Indians. They appear only in vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructions, and a com|plicated train of chronic di&s;ea&s;es. Thus putrid mia&s;mata are &s;ometimes too &s;trong to bring on a fever, but produce in&s;tant debility, and death. The Gout is &s;eldom heard of in Ru&s;&s;ia, Denmark or Poland. Is this occa&s;ioned by the vigor of con&s;titu|tion peculiar to the inhabitants of tho&s;e northern countries? Or is it cau&s;ed by their exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, which produce the &s;ame chronic com|plaints among them, which we &s;aid were common among the lower cla&s;s of people in this country? The &s;imilarity of their di&s;ea&s;es, makes the la&s;t of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;iti|ons the mo&s;t probable. The effects of wine, like tyrranny in a well formed govern|ment, are felt fir&s;t in the extremities; while &s;pirits, like a bold invader, &s;eize at once upon the vitals of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="013592_0023_0F91448388DA1530">I CANNOT find any accounts of di&s;ea&s;es from WORMS among the Indians. Worms are common to mo&s;t animals; they pro|duce di&s;ea&s;es only in weak, or increa&s;e them in &s;trong con&s;titutions.&mdash;Hence they have no place in the no&s;ological &s;y&s;tems of phy&s;ic. Nor does DENTITION appear to be a di&s;order among the Indi|ans. The facility with which the heal|thy children of healthy parents cut their teeth, among civilized nations, gives us rea&s;on to conclude that the Indian chil|dren never &s;uffer from this quarter.</P>
<P>THE employments of the Indians &s;ub|ject them to many accidents; hence we &s;ometimes read of WOUNDS, FRACTURES, and LUXATIONS among them.</P>
<P>HAVING thus pointed out the na|tural di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians, and &s;hown what di&s;orders are foreign to them; we may venture to conclude, that FE|VERS, OLD AGE, CASUALTIES and WAR are the only natural outlets of hu|man life. War is nothing but a di&s;|temper; it is founded in the imperfecti|on of political bodies; ju&s;t as fevers are
<PB N="27" REF="013592_0024_0F9144844570EDD8">founded on the weakne&s;s of the animal body.&mdash;Providence in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es &s;eems to act like a mild legi&s;lature, which miti|gates the &s;everity of death, by inflicting it in a manner the lea&s;t painful upon the whole, to the patient and the &s;urvivors.</P>
<P>LET us now enquire into the REMEDIES of the Indians. The&s;e like their di&s;ea&s;es are &s;imple, and few in number. Among the fir&s;t of them we &s;hall mention the POWERS of NATURE. Fevers we &s;aid formerly, con&s;tituted the chief of the di&s;|ea&s;es among the Indians; they are like|wi&s;e, in the hands of nature, the principal in&s;truments to remove the evils which threaten her di&s;&s;olution; (d) but the event of the&s;e efforts of nature, no doubt, &s;oon convinced the Indians of the danger of tru&s;ting her in all ca&s;es; and hence in the earlie&s;t accounts we have of their manners, we read of per&s;ons who were intru&s;ted with the office of phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>IT will be difficult to find out the ex|act order, in which the Indian remedies were &s;ugge&s;ted by nature; or di&s;covered by art; nor will it be ea&s;y to arrange them in proper order. I &s;hall however attempt
<PB N="28" REF="013592_0025_0F91448557DE7D28">it, by reducing them to NATURAL, and ARTIFICIAL.</P>
<P>To the cla&s;s of NATURAL REMEDIES belongs the Indian practice, of ab&s;tracting from their patients all kinds of &s;timulat|ing aliment. The compliance of the In|dians with this dictate of nature, in the early &s;tage of a di&s;order, no doubt, pre|vents in many ca&s;es, their being obliged to u&s;e any other remedy. They follow nature &s;till clo&s;er, in allowing their pati|ents to drink plentifully of cold water; this being the only liquor a patient calls for in a fever.</P>
<P>SWEATING is likewi&s;e a natural reme|dy. It was probably &s;ugge&s;ted by ob&s;erv|ing fevers to be terminated by it. I &s;hall not enquire how far the&s;e &s;weats are e&s;|&s;ential to the cri&s;is of fevers. The Indian mode of procuring this evacuation is as follows; the patient is confined in a clo&s;e tent, or wigwam, over a hole in the earth, in which a red hot &s;tone is placed; a quantity of water is thrown upon this &s;tone, which in&s;tantly involves the patient in a cloud of vapour and &s;weat; in this
<PB N="29" REF="013592_0026_0F91448993C77DE8">&s;ituation he ru&s;hes out, and plunges him|&s;elf into a river; from whence he retires to his bed. If the remedy has been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, he ri&s;es from his bed in four and twenty hours, perfectly recovered from his indi&s;po&s;ition. This remedy is u&s;ed not only to cure fevers, but to re|move that unea&s;ine&s;s which ari&s;es from fatigue of body.</P>
<P>A THIRD natural remedy among the Indians, is PURGING. The fruits of the earth, the fle&s;h of birds, and other animals feeding upon particular vege|tables, and above all, the &s;pontaneous efforts of nature, early led the Indians to perceive the nece&s;&s;ity and advantages of this evacuation.</P>
<P>VOMITS con&s;titute their fourth natural remedy. They were probably like the for|mer, &s;ugge&s;ted by nature, and accident. The ipecacuana is one of the many roots they employ, for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE ARTIFICIAL REMEDIES made u&s;e of by the Indians, are BLEEDING, CAUS|TICS, and ASTRINGENT medicines. They confine bleeding entirely to the part af|fected.
<PB N="30" REF="013592_0027_0F91448B52366250">To know that opening a vein in the arm, or foot, would relieve a pain in the head, or &s;ide, &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome know|ledge of the animal oeconomy, and there|fore marks an advanced period in the hi&s;tory of medicine.</P>
<P>SHARP &s;tones and thorns, are the in|&s;truments they u&s;e, to procure a di&s;charge of blood.</P>
<P>WE have an account of the Indians u&s;ing &s;omething like a POTENTIAL CAUS|TIC, in ob&s;tinate pains. It con&s;i&s;ts of a piece of rotten wood, called <HI>punk,</HI> which they place upon the part affected, and afterwards &s;et it on fire; the fire gra|dually con&s;umes the wood, and its a&s;hes burn a hole in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>THE undue efforts of nature, in tho&s;e fevers which are connected with a diarr|hoea, or dy&s;entry, together with tho&s;e hemorrhages to which their mode of life expo&s;ed them, nece&s;&s;arily led them to an early di&s;covery of &s;ome ASTRINGENT VEGETABLES. I am uncertain whether the Indians rely upon a&s;tringent, or
<PB N="31" REF="013592_0028_0F91448D06532400">any other vegetables, for the cure of the intermitting fever. This di&s;ea&s;e among them probably requires no other reme|dies than the cold bath, or cold air. Its greater ob&s;tinacy, as well as frequency among our&s;elves, mu&s;t be &s;ought for in the greater feeblene&s;s of our con&s;tituti|ons; and in that change which our country has undergone, from meadows&mdash; mill-dams&mdash;and the cutting down of woods; whereby morbid exhalations have been multiplied, and their pa&s;&s;age rendered more free, through every part of the country. (e)</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;hort account of the remedies of the Indians. If they are &s;imple, they are like their eloquence, full of &s;trength; if they are few in number, they are ac|commodated, as their languages are to their ideas, to the whole of their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>WE &s;aid formerly that the Indians were &s;ubject to ACCIDENTS, &s;uch as wounds&mdash;fractures&mdash;and the like. In the&s;e ca&s;es, nature performs the office of a &s;urgeon. We may judge of her qualifi|cations for this office, by ob&s;erving the
<PB N="32" REF="013592_0029_0F914401BA006B50">marks of wounds, and fractures, which are &s;ometimes di&s;covered on wild ani|mals. But further, what is the practice of our modern &s;urgeons in the&s;e ca&s;es? Is it not to lay a&s;ide pla&s;ters and oint|ments, and tru&s;t the whole to nature? Tho&s;e ulcers which require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mercury, bark, and a particular regi|men, are unknown to the Indians.</P>
<P>THEIR practice of attempting to reco|ver DROWNED PEOPLE, is irrational and un&s;ucce&s;sful. It con&s;i&s;ts in &s;u&s;pending the patient by the heels, in order that the water may flow from his mouth. This practice is founded on a belief, that the patient dies from &s;wallowing an exce&s;&s;ive quantity of water. But modern ob&s;erva|tion teaches us, that, drowned people die of an apoplexy. This di&s;covery naturally &s;ugge&s;ts a method of cure, di|rectly oppo&s;ite to that in u&s;e among the Indians; and &s;hows us that the practice of &s;u&s;pending by the heels is hurtful.</P>
<P>WE have heard much of their &s;peci|fic antidotes to the VENEREAL DISEASE. In the accounts of the&s;e antivenereal me|dicines,
<PB N="33" REF="013592_0030_0F91440279FF6980">&s;ome abatement &s;hould be made for that love of the marvellous, and of novelty, which are apt to creep into the writings of travellers, and phy&s;icians. How many medicines which were once thought infallible in this di&s;order, are now rejected from the materia medica! I have found upon enquiry, that the Indians always a&s;&s;i&s;t their medicines in this di&s;|ea&s;e, by a regimen which promotes per|&s;piration. Should we allow that mercury acts as a &s;pecific in de&s;troying this di&s;|order, it does not follow that it is proof again&s;t the efficacy of medicines which act more mechanically upon the body. (f)</P>
<P>THERE cannot be a &s;tronger mark of the imperfect &s;tate of knowledge in medi|cine among the Indians, than their method of treating the SMALL-POX. We are told that they plunge them&s;elves in cold water, in the beginning of the di&s;order, and that it generally proves fatal to them.</P>
<P>TRAVELLERS &s;peak in high terms of the Indian ANTIDOTES to POISONS. We mu&s;t remember, that many things have been
<PB N="34" REF="013592_0031_0F914403742BCA08">thought poi&s;onous, which later experi|ence hath proved to po&s;&s;e&s;s no unwhole|&s;ome quality. Moreover the uncertainty and variety in the operation of poi&s;ons, render it extremely difficult to fix the certainty of their antidotes, to them. How many &s;pecifics have derived their credit for preventing the hydrophobia, from per&s;ons being wounded by animals, who were not in a &s;ituation to produce that di&s;order! IF we may judge of all the Indian antidotes to poi&s;ons, by tho&s;e which have fallen into our hands, we have little rea&s;on to a&s;cribe much to them in any ca&s;es whatever.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard of their performing &s;everal remarkable cures upon STIFF JOINTS, by an infu&s;ion of certain herbs in water.&mdash; The mixture of &s;everal herbs together in this infu&s;ion calls in que&s;tion the &s;pecific efficacy of each of them. I cannot help attributing the whole &s;ucce&s;s of this re|medy, to the great heat of the water, in which the herbs were boiled; and to its being applied a long time to the part af|fected. We find the &s;ame medicine to vary frequently in its &s;ucce&s;s, according
<PB N="35" REF="013592_0032_0F914406685E9070">to its &s;trength, or to the continuance of its application. De Haen attributes the good effects of electricity, entirely to its being u&s;ed for &s;everal months.</P>
<P>We are &s;ometimes amu&s;ed with accounts of Indian remedies for the DROPSY&mdash;EPI|LEPSY&mdash;COLIC&mdash;GRAVEL and GOUT. If with all the advantages which modern phy&s;icians derive from their knowledge in ANATOMY&mdash;CHEMISTRY&mdash;BOTANY and PHILOSOPHY, if with the benefit of di&s;co|veries communicated from abroad, as well as handed down from our ance&s;tors, by more certain methods than tradition, we are &s;till ignorant of certain remedies for the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es; what can we expect from the Indians, who are not only deprived of the&s;e advantages, but want our chief motive, the &s;en&s;e of the pain and dan|ger of tho&s;e di&s;orders, to prompt them to &s;eek for &s;uch remedies to relieve them? There cannot be a &s;tronger proof of their ignorance of proper remedies for new or difficult di&s;ea&s;es, than their having re|cour&s;e to enchantment. But to be more particular; I have taken pains to enquire
<PB N="36" REF="013592_0033_0F91440793186998">into the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome of the&s;e Indian &s;pecifics, and have never heard of one well atte&s;ted ca&s;e of their efficacy. I believe they derive all their credit from our be|ing ignorant of their compo&s;ition. The influence of &s;ecrecy is well known in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the credit of a medicine. The &s;al &s;eignet was an infallible medicine for the intermitting fever, while the manu|factory of it was confined to an apothe|cary at Rochelle; but it lo&s;t its virtues as &s;oon as it was found to be compo&s;ed of the &s;alt of tartar, and a fo&s;&s;il alkali. Doctor Ward's famous pill and drop, cea&s;ed to do wonders in &s;crophulous ca&s;es, as &s;oon as he bequeathed to the world his receipts for making them.</P>
<P>I FORESEE an objection to what has been &s;aid concerning the remedies of the In|dians, drawn from that knowledge which experience gives to a mind intent upon one &s;ubject. We have heard much of the perfection of their &s;en&s;es of &s;eeing and hearing. An Indian we are told, will di&s;|cover not only a particular tribe of In|dians by their foot&s;teps, but the di&s;tance of time in which they were made. In
<PB N="37" REF="013592_0034_0F914407D11784D0">tho&s;e branches of knowledge which re|late to hunting and war, the Indians have accquired a degree of perfection that has not been equalled by civilized nations. But we mu&s;t remember that medicine among them does not enjoy the like advantage, the arts of war and hunting, of being the chief object of their attention. The phy&s;ician and the warrior are united in one character; to render him as able in the former, as he is in the latter profe&s;&s;ion, would re|quire an entire ab&s;traction from every other employment, and a familiarity with external objects, which are incompatible with the wandering life of &s;avages.</P>
<P>THUS have we fini&s;hed our enquiry into the di&s;ea&s;es and remedies of the Indians in North-America.&mdash;We come now to enquire into the di&s;ea&s;es and remedies of civilized nations.</P>
<P>NATIONS differ in their, degrees of civilization. We &s;hall &s;elect one for the &s;ubject of our enquiries which is mo&s;t familiar to us; I mean the Briti&s;h Nation. Here we behold &s;ubordination and cla&s;&s;es
<PB N="38" REF="013592_0035_0F9144089921E238">of mankind e&s;tabli&s;hed by government&mdash;commerce&mdash;manufactures, and certain cu&s;toms common to mo&s;t of the civilized nations of Europe. We &s;hall trace the origin of their di&s;ea&s;es through their cu&s;|toms, in the &s;ame manner as we did tho&s;e of the Indians.</P>
<P N="1">I. IT will be &s;ufficient to name the degrees of heat &mdash; the improper aliment &mdash;the tight dre&s;&s;es, and the premature &s;tudies children are expo&s;ed to, in order to &s;how the ample &s;cope for di&s;ea&s;es, which is added to the original defect of &s;tamina, they derive from their ance&s;|tors.</P>
<P N="2">II. CIVILIZATION ri&s;es in its demands upon the health of women. Their fa&s;hi|ons, their dre&s;s and diet&mdash;their eager pur&s;uits and ardent enjoyment of plea|&s;ure&mdash;their indolence and undue eva|cuations in pregnancy&mdash;their cordials &mdash;hot regimen and neglect or u&s;e of art, in child-birth, are all &s;o many inlets to di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>HUMANITY would fain be &s;ilent, while philo&s;ophy calls upon us to mention the
<PB N="39" REF="013592_0036_0F9144094F506130">effects of intere&s;ted marriages&mdash;of di&s;ap|pointments in love, encrea&s;ed by that concealment which the tyranny of cu&s;tom has impo&s;ed upon the &s;ex; and la&s;tly, the effects of the long delay of the marriage bed. (g) All the&s;e exaggerate the natural, and encrea&s;e the number of artificial di&s;ea&s;es among women.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE di&s;ea&s;es introduced by civi|lization extend them&s;elves through every cla&s;s and profe&s;&s;ion among men. How fatal are the effects of idlene&s;s and intem|perance among the rich&mdash;and of hard labor and penury among the poor! What palid looks are contracted by the votaries of &s;cience from hanging over the "&s;ick|ly taper." How many di&s;ea&s;es are en|tailed upon manufacturers, by the mate|rials in which they work, and the po&s;|ture of their bodies! What monki&s;h di&s;ea&s;es do we ob&s;erve from monki&s;h continence, and monki&s;h vices! We pa&s;s over the increa&s;e of accidents from build|ing&mdash;&s;ailing&mdash; riding and the like. War as if too &s;low in de&s;troying the human &s;pecies, calls in a train of di&s;ea&s;es pecu|liar to civilized nations. What havoc
<PB N="40" REF="013592_0037_0F914409F9B894B0">have the corruption and monopoly of pro|vi&s;ions&mdash;a damp &s;oil, and an unwhole|&s;ome &s;ky, made in a few days in an ar|my! The atchievements of briti&s;h valor at the Havannah, in the la&s;t war, were obtained at the expence of 9,000 men, 7,000 of whom peri&s;hed with the We&s;t-India fever. (h) Even our modern di&s;|coveries in geography, by extending the empire of commerce, have likewi&s;e ex|tended the empire of di&s;ea&s;es. What de&s;olation have the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies made, of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects! It has been found upon a nice calculation, that only ten of an hundred Europeans, live above &s;even years after they arrive in the i&s;land of Jamaica. (i)</P>
<P N="4">IV. IT would take up too much of our time to point out all the cu&s;toms both <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> and <HI>moral,</HI> which influence di&s;|ea&s;es among both &s;exes. The former have engendred the &s;eeds of di&s;ea&s;es, in the human body it&s;elf; hence the origin of catarrhs&mdash;jail and miliary fevers; with a long train of contagious di&s;orders, which compo&s;e &s;o great a part of our books of medicine. The latter likewi&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="013592_0038_0F91440AC8C8A840">have a large &s;hare in producing di&s;ea&s;es. I am not one of tho&s;e modern philo&s;o|phers, who derive the vices of mankind from the influence of civilization: but I am &s;afe in a&s;&s;erting, that their number and malignity encrea&s;e with the refine|ments of poli&s;hed life. To prove this, we need only &s;urvey a &s;cene too fami|liar to affect us: it is a bedlam, which inju&s;tice &mdash; inhumanity &mdash; avarice&mdash; pride &mdash; vanity and ambition have filled with inhabitants.</P>
<P>THUS have we briefly pointed out the cu&s;toms which influence the di&s;ea&s;es of civilized nations. It remains now that we take notice of their di&s;ea&s;es. With|out naming the many new fevers, fluxes, haemorrhages, &s;wellings from water, wind, fle&s;h, fat, pus and blood; foulne&s;&s;es on the &s;kin from cancers, lepras, yaws, poxes, itch; and la&s;tly, the gout, the hy|&s;teria, and the hypochondria&s;is, in all their variety of known and unknown &s;hapes: I &s;hall &s;um all that is nece&s;&s;ary upon this &s;ubject by adding, that the number of di&s;ea&s;es which belong to civilized nations, according to Doctor Cullen's no&s;ology,
<PB N="42" REF="013592_0039_0F91440B8D813AC8">amounts to 1,387: the &s;ingle cla&s;s of nervous di&s;ea&s;es form 612 of this num|ber.</P>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to &s;peak of the remedies of civilized nations, we &s;hall examine into the abilities of NATURE in curing their di&s;ea&s;es. We found her active and &s;ucce&s;sful in curing the di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians. Is her &s;trength, wi&s;dom, or benignity, equal to the encrea&s;e of tho&s;e dangers which threaten her di&s;&s;o|lution among civilized nations? In or|der to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain the meaning of the term nature.</P>
<P>BY NATURE, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I un|der&s;tand nothing but phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity: this at once excludes every thing like in|telligence from her operations: the&s;e are all performed in obedience to the &s;ame laws, which govern vegetation in plants and the inte&s;tine motions of fo&s;&s;ils: they are as truly mechanical as the laws of gravitation, electricity, or magneti&s;m. A &s;hip when laid on her broad&s;ide by a wave, or a &s;udden bla&s;t of wind, ri&s;es
<PB N="43" REF="013592_0040_0F91440C44CF4ED8">by the &s;imple laws of her mechani&s;m: but &s;uppo&s;e this &s;hip to be attacked by fire, or a water-&s;pout, we are not to call in que&s;tion the &s;kill of the &s;hip-builder, if &s;he is con&s;umed by the one, or &s;unk by the other. In like manner the author of nature hath furni&s;hed the body with powers to pre&s;erve it&s;elf from its natural enemies; but when it is attacked by tho&s;e civil foes which are bred by the pe|culiar cu&s;toms of civilization, it re&s;em|bles a company of Indians, armed with bows and arrows, again&s;t the complicated and deadly machinery of fire-arms. To place this &s;ubject in a proper light, we &s;hall deliver a hi&s;tory of the operations of nature in a few of the di&s;ea&s;es of civi|lized nations.</P>
<P N="1">I. THERE are ca&s;es in which nature is &s;till &s;ucce&s;sful in curing di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IN fevers &s;he &s;till deprives us of our appetite for animal food, and imparts to us a de&s;ire for cool air and cold water.</P>
<P>IN haemorrhages &s;he produces a fainti|ne&s;s, which occa&s;ions a coagulum in the
<PB N="44" REF="013592_0041_0F91440D01D64A88">open ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that the further pa&s;&s;age of blood through them is ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>IN wounds of the fle&s;h and bones, &s;he di&s;charges foreign matter by exciting an inflammation, and &s;upplies the wa&s;te of both with new fle&s;h and bone.</P>
<P N="2">II. THERE are ca&s;es where the efforts of nature are too feeble to do &s;ervice, as in putrid and nervous fevers.</P>
<P N="3">III. THERE are ca&s;es where the efforts of nature are over-proportioned to the &s;trength of the di&s;ea&s;e, as in the cholera morbus and dy&s;entery.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THERE are ca&s;es where nature is idle, as in the atonic &s;tages of the gout, the cancer, the epilep&s;y the mania, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, the apoplexy and the tetanus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoffman de Hypothe&s;ium Medicarum Damno Sect. xv.</NOTE></P>

<P>LET us now take a COMPARITIVE VIEW of the di&s;ea&s;es and remedies of the In|dians, with tho&s;e of civilized nations. We &s;hall begin with their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IN our account of the di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians we beheld death executing his commi&s;&s;ion, it is true; but then his dart was hid in a mantle, under which he concealed his &s;hape. But among civiliz|ed nations we behold him multiplying his weapons in proportion to the number of organs and functions in the body; and pointing each of them in &s;uch a manner, as to render his me&s;&s;engers more terrible than him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="013592_0045_0F9144136689EBC8">WE &s;aid formerly that fevers con&s;tituted the chief di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians. Accord|ing to Dr. Sydenham's computation above 66,000 out of 100,000 died of fevers in London about 100 years ago; but fevers now con&s;titute but a little more than one tenth part of the di&s;ea&s;es of that city. Out of 21,780 per&s;ons who died in London between December 1770 and December 1771, only 2273 died of &s;imple fevers. I have more than once heard Dr. Huck complain, that he could find no marks of epidemic fevers in London as de&s;cribed by Dr. Sydenham. London has undergone a revolution in its manners and cu&s;toms &s;ince Dr. Syden|ham's time. New di&s;ea&s;es, the offspring of luxury, have &s;upplanted fevers; and the few that are left, appear &s;o complicat|ed with other di&s;ea&s;es, that their connec|tion can no longer be di&s;covered with an epedemic con&s;titution of the year. The pleuri&s;y and periupneumony, tho&s;e inflammatory fevers of &s;trong con&s;tituti|ons, are now lo&s;t in catarrhs, or colds; which in&s;tead of challenging the powers of nature or art to a fair combat, in|&s;en&s;ibly

Out of 22,434 who died between December 1769 and the &s;ame month in 1770, 4594 peri&s;hed with that briti&s;h di&s;order. Our countryman Dr. Maclurg has ventured to foretel that the Gout will be lo&s;t in a few years, in a train of hypochondriac, hy&s;teric and bilious di&s;orders. In like man|ner, may we not look for a &s;ea&s;on when fevers, the natural di&s;ea&s;es of the human body, will be lo&s;t in an inundation of arti|ficial di&s;ea&s;es, brought on by the modi&s;h practices of modern civilization?</P>
<P>IT may not be improper to compare the PROGNOSIS of the Indians, in di&s;ea&s;es, with that of civilized nations, before we take a comparative view of their remedies.</P>
<P>THE Indians are &s;aid to be &s;ucce&s;sful in predicting the events of di&s;ea&s;es. While di&s;ea&s;es are &s;imple, the marks which di&s;tingui&s;h them, or characterize their &s;everal &s;tages, are generally uniform and obvious to the mo&s;t indifferent ob|&s;erver. The&s;e marks afford &s;o much
<PB N="50" REF="013592_0047_0F91441549F3E1D0">certainty, that the Indians &s;ometimes kill their phy&s;icians for a fal&s;e progno&s;is, charging the death of the patient to his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or ignorance. They e&s;timate the danger of their patients by their de|grees of appetite; while an Indian is able to eat, he is looked upon as free from danger. But when we con&s;ider the num|ber and variety in the &s;igns of di&s;ea&s;es, among civilized nations, together with the &s;hortne&s;s of life, the fallacy of me|mory, and the uncertainty of ob&s;ervati|on; where &s;hall we find a phy&s;ician will|ing to ri&s;k his reputation, much le&s;s his life, upon the prediction of the event of our acute di&s;ea&s;es? We can derive no advantage from the &s;imple &s;ign, by which the Indians e&s;timate the danger of their patients; for we daily &s;ee a want of ap|petite for food in di&s;ea&s;es which are at|tended with no danger; and we &s;ome|times ob&s;erve an unu&s;ual degree of this appetite to precede the agonies of death. I honour the name of HIPPOCRATES: But forgive me ye votaries of antiquity, if I attempt to pluck a few grey hairs from his venerable head. I was once an idola|ter at his altar, nor did I turn apo&s;tate
<PB N="51" REF="013592_0048_0F9144160CA8F780">from his wor&s;hip, till I was taught, that not a tenth part of his progno&s;tics corre&s;|ponded with modern experience, or ob|&s;ervation. (k) The pul&s;e, (l) urine (m) and &s;weats (n) from which the principal &s;igns of life and death have been taken, are &s;o variable in mo&s;t of the acute di&s;ea&s;es of civilized nations, that the wi&s;e&s;t phy&s;icians have in &s;ome mea&s;ure excluded the prog|no&s;is, from being a part of their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I AM here in&s;en&s;ibly led to make an apology for the in&s;tability of the theories, and practice of phy&s;ic. The theory of phy&s;ic is founded upon the laws of the animal oeconomy. The&s;e (unlike the laws of the mind, or the common laws of matter) do not appear at once, but are gradually brought to light, by the phe|nomina of di&s;ea&s;es. The &s;ucce&s;s of nature, in curing the &s;imple di&s;ea&s;es of Saxony, laid the foundation for the ANIMA MEDICA of Dr. STAHL. The endemicks of Holland (o) led Dr. BOERHAAVE to &s;eek for the cau&s;es of all di&s;ea&s;es in the FLUIDS. And the univer&s;al prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;es of the NERVES, in Great-Britain, led Dr. CULLEN to di&s;cover their
<PB N="52" REF="013592_0049_0F914416EDC558A0">peculiar laws, and to found a SYSTEM upon them. A &s;y&s;tem, which will pro|bably la&s;t till &s;ome new di&s;ea&s;es are let loo&s;e upon the human &s;pecies, which &s;hall unfold other laws of the animal oeconomy!</P>
<P>IT is in con&s;equence of this fluctuation in the principles, and practice of phy&s;ic, being &s;o nece&s;&s;arily connected with the changes in the cu&s;toms of civilized nati|ons, that old and young phy&s;icians &s;o often di&s;agree, in their opinions and practices. And it is by attending to the con&s;tant changes in the&s;e cu&s;toms of civilized nations, that tho&s;e phy&s;icians have generally become the mo&s;t eminent, who have &s;oone&s;t emancipated them&s;elves from the tyranny of the &s;chools of phy&s;ic; and have occa&s;ionly accomodat|ed their principles, and practice, to the changes in di&s;ea&s;es. (p) This variety in di&s;ea&s;es, which is produced by the changes in the cu&s;toms of civilized nations, will enable us to account for many of the con|tradictions which are to be found in authors of equal candor, and abilities, who have written of the materia medica.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="013592_0050_0F91441796EE29B8">IN forming a comparative view of the REMEDIES of the Indians, with tho&s;e of civilized nations, we &s;hall remark, that the want of &s;ucce&s;s in a medicine, is oc|ca&s;ioned by one of the following cau&s;es.</P>
<P>FIRST, our ignorance of the di&s;order. Secondly, an ignorance of a &s;uitable re|medy. Thirdly, a want of efficacy in the remedy.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the violence of the di&s;|ea&s;es of the Indians, it is probable their want of &s;ucce&s;s, is always occa&s;ioned by a want of efficacy in their medicines. But the ca&s;e is very different among civilized nations. Di&s;&s;ections daily convince us of our ignorance of the &s;eats of di&s;ea&s;es, and cau&s;e us to blu&s;h at our pre&s;criptions. What certain or equal remedies have we found for the gout, the epilep&s;y, apoplexy, pal&s;y, drop&s;y of the brain, cancer and con&s;umption? How often are we di&s;ap|pointed in our expectations, from the the mo&s;t certain and powerful of our remedies, by the negligence or ob&s;tina|cy of our patients! What mi&s;chief have we not done under the belief of fal&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="013592_0051_0F91441838A36B90">facts, and fal&s;e theories! We have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in multiplying di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;We have done more&mdash;we have increa&s;ed their mortality. (q)&mdash;</P>
<P>I SHALL not pau&s;e to beg pardon of the faculty, for acknowledging in this public manner the weakne&s;&s;es of our profe&s;&s;ion. I am pur&s;uing truth, and while I can keep my eye fixed upon my guide&mdash;I am indifferent whiter I am led, provided &s;he is my leader.</P>
<P>BUT further, the Indian &s;ubmits to his di&s;ea&s;e, without one fearful emotion, from his doubtfulne&s;s of its event; and at la&s;t meets his fate without an anxious wi&s;h for futurity; except it is of being admitted to an "equal &s;ky" where
<Q>"His faithful dog &s;hall bear him company."</Q>
But among civilized nations, the influ|ence of a fal&s;e religion in good, and of a true religion in bad men, has converted even the fear of death into a di&s;ea&s;e. It is this original di&s;temper of the imagination which renders the plague mo&s;t fatal, up|on its fir&s;t appearance in a country.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="013592_0052_0F91441B5C68CBF0">UNDER all the&s;e di&s;advantages, in the &s;tate of medicine, among civilized nati|ons, do more in proportion die of the di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to them, than of fevers, cau&s;ualties and old age, among the In|dians? If we take our account from the city of London, we &s;hall find this to be the ca&s;e. Near a twentieth part of its inhabitants peri&s;h one year with another. Nor does the natural increa&s;e of inhabitants &s;upply this yearly wa&s;te. If we judge from the bills of mortality, the city of London contains fewer inha|bitants, by &s;everal thou&s;ands, than it did forty years ago. It appears from this fact, and many others of a like nature, which might be adduced, that although the difficulty of &s;upporting children, to|gether with &s;ome peculiar cu&s;toms of the Indians, which we mentioned, limit their number; yet they multiply fa&s;ter, and die in a &s;maller proportion than civilized nations, under the circum&s;tances we have de&s;cribed. The Indians we are told were numerous in this country, before the Europeans &s;ettled among them. Travel|lers agree likewi&s;e in de&s;cribing numbers
<PB N="56" REF="013592_0053_0F91441CAE0BBC28">of both &s;exes, who exhibited all the marks of extreme old age. It is remarkable that age &s;eldom impairs the faculties of their minds.</P>
<P>THE mortality peculiar to tho&s;e In|dian tribes who have mingled with the white people mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the exten&s;ive mi&s;chief of &s;pirituous liquors. When the&s;e have not acted, they have &s;uf|fered from having accomodated them&s;elves too &s;uddenly to the European diet, dre&s;s, and manners. It does not become us to pry too much into futurity; but if we may judge from the fate of the origi|nal natives of Hi&s;paniola, Jamaica, and the provinces on the continent, we may venture to foretel, that, in proportion as the white people multiply, the Indians will dimini&s;h; &s;o that in a few centu|ries they will probabl be entirely extir|pated. (r)</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, that health among the Indians, like in&s;en&s;ibility to cold and hun|ger, is proportioned to their need of it; and that the le&s;s degrees, or entire
<PB N="57" REF="013592_0054_0F91441CC9E9C010">want of health are no interruption to the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of civilized life.</P>
<P>To obviate this &s;uppo&s;ition we &s;hall fir&s;t attend to the effects of a &s;ingle di&s;|temper in tho&s;e people, who are the prin|cipal wheels in the machine of civil &s;ociety. Ju&s;tice has &s;topt its current&mdash; victories have been lo&s;t&mdash;wars have been prolonged, and emba&s;&s;ies delayed, by the principal actors in the&s;e departments of government, being &s;uddenly laid up with a &s;it of the gout. How many of|fences are daily committed again&s;t the rules of good breeding, by the tedious hi&s;tories of our di&s;orders, which com|po&s;e &s;o great a part of modern conver|&s;ation! What &s;ums of money have been lavi&s;hed in foreign countries in pur&s;uit of health! (s) Families have been ruined by the unavoidable expences of medi|cines, and watering places. In a word, the &s;warms of beggars which infe&s;t &s;o many of the European countries, urge their petitions for charity chiefly by ar|guments derived from real or counter|feit di&s;ea&s;es, which render them incapa|ble of &s;upporting them&s;elves.

<P>THE hi&s;tory of the number, combi|nations and fa&s;hions of the remedies we have given, may &s;erve to humble the pride of philo&s;ophy; and to convince us that with all the advantages of the whole circle of &s;ciences, we are &s;till ignorant of antidotes to the chief of the di&s;ea&s;es of ci|vilized nations. We &s;ometimes &s;ooth our ignorance by reproaching our idlene&s;s in not inve&s;tigating the remedies peculiar to this country. We are taught to be|lieve that every herb that grows in our woods, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome medicinal virtue, and that heaven would be want|ing in benignity if our country did not produce remedies, for all the different di&s;ea&s;es of its inhabitants.

It would &s;eem &s;trange that the author of nature &s;hould furni&s;h every &s;pot of ground, with medicines adapted to the di&s;ea&s;es of its inhabitants, and at the &s;ame time deny it the more nece&s;&s;ary articles of food and cloathing. I know not whether heaven has provided every country with antidotes even to the <HI>natural</HI> di&s;ea&s;es of its inhabitants.

The combination of bitter and a&s;tringent &s;ub&s;tances which &s;erve as a &s;uccedaneum to the Peruvian bark is as much a preparation of art, as calomel, or tartar emetic.

The food of the inhabitants was then &s;imple: their only drink was wa|ter: their appetites were re&s;trained by labor: religion excluded the influence of &s;ickening pa&s;&s;ions: private ho&s;pitality &s;up|plied the want of a public ho&s;pital: na|ture was their only nur&s;e: temperance their principal phy&s;ician. But I mu&s;t not dwell upon this retro&s;pect of primeval manners: and I am too &s;trongly impre&s;&s;|ed with a hope of a revival of &s;uch hap|py days, to pronounce them the golden age of our province.</P>
<P>OUR e&s;teem for the cu&s;toms of our &s;a|vage neighbours will be le&s;&s;ened when
<PB N="66" REF="013592_0063_0F914428096388B0">we add, that civilization does not pre|clude the honors of old age. The pro|portion of old people is much greater among civilized, than among &s;avage na|tions. It would be ea&s;y to decide this a&s;|&s;ertion in our favor, by appealing to facts in the natural hi&s;tories of Britain, Nor|way, Sweden, the province of Connecti|cut, and &s;everal of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands. (k k)</P>
<P>THE laws of decency and nature, are not nece&s;&s;arily aboli&s;hed by the cu&s;toms of civilized nations. In many of the&s;e, we read of women among whom nature alone &s;till performs the office of a mid|wife (l l)&mdash;and who feel the obligations of &s;uckling their children, to be equally binding with the common obligations of morality.</P>
<P>CIVILIZATION does not render us le&s;s fit for the nece&s;&s;ary hard&s;hips of war. We read of armies of civilized nations, who have endured degrees of cold, hun|ger and fatigue, which have not been exceeded by the &s;avages of any country. (m m)</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="013592_0064_0F914428D4F8D5E0">CIVILIZATION does not always multi|ply the avenues of death. It appears from the bills of mortality, of many countries, that fewer in proportion die among civilized, than among &s;avage na|tions.(n n)</P>
<P>EVEN the charms of beauty are not nece&s;&s;arily given up in civilization. We read of &s;tateline&s;s, proportion, and fine complexions in both &s;exes, forming the principal outlines of national characters.</P>
<P>THE danger of many di&s;ea&s;es, is not proportioned to their violence, but to their duration. America has advanced but a few paces in luxury and effemina|cy. There is yet &s;trength enough in her vitals, to give life to tho&s;e parts which are decayed. She may recal her &s;teps. &mdash;For this purpo&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">I. LET our children be educated in a manner more agreeable to nature.</P>
<P N="2">II. LET the common people (who con|&s;titute the wealth and &s;trength of our country) be pre&s;erved from the effects of
<PB N="68" REF="013592_0065_0F91442A86369768">intemperance. The increa&s;e of the price of &s;pirituous liquors for this purpo&s;e, is a remedy as unequal to the de&s;ign, as it is de&s;tructive to liberty and commerce. Sir William Temple tells us, that in Spain no man can be admitted as an evidence in court, who has once been convicted of drunkenne&s;s. I do not call for &s;o &s;e|vere a law in this country. Let us fir&s;t try the force of &s;evere manners. Lycur|gus governed more by the&s;e, than by his laws. "Bonae mores non bonae leges," according to Tacitus, were the bulwarks of virtue among the ancient Germans.</P>
<P N="3">III. LET us be cautious what kind of manufactures we admit among us. What is patrioti&s;m in one country may be trea|&s;on in another. The &s;ame public &s;pirit which leads a Hollander to promote all kinds of manufactories in his country overgrown with inhabitants, &s;hould lead us to oppo&s;e them, as hurtful to the true intere&s;t of our own. The rickets made their fir&s;t appearance in the manufactur|ing towns in England. Dr. Fothergill informed me, that he had often ob&s;erved, when a pupil, that the greate&s;t part of
<PB N="69" REF="013592_0066_0F91442B014C4298">the chronic patients in the London-Ho&s;|pital were Spitalfield weavers. I would not be under&s;tood, from the&s;e facts, to di&s;courage tho&s;e manufactures which em|ploy women and children: the&s;e &s;uffer few inconveniencies from a &s;edentary life: nor do I mean to offer the lea&s;t re|&s;traint to tho&s;e manufactories among men, which admit of free air and the exerci&s;e of all their limbs.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I DESPAIR of being able to call the votaries of Bacchus from their bottle, and &s;hall therefore leave them to be rou&s;ed by the more eloquent twinges of the gout.</P>
<P N="5">V. I PASS over likewi&s;e the ravages which TEA is making upon the health and populou&s;ne&s;s of our country. Had I a double portion of all that eloquence which has been employed in de&s;cribing the political evils which lately accompa|nied this Ea&s;t-India herb, it would be too little to &s;et forth the numerous and com|plicated di&s;ea&s;es which it has introduced among us. To encounter this hydra, re|quires
<PB N="70" REF="013592_0067_0F91442BC0B5DE98">an arm accu&s;tomed, like that of Hercules, to vanqui&s;h mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE population of a country is not to be accompli&s;hed by rewards and puni&s;h|ments. And it is happy for America, that the univer&s;al prevalence of the pro|te&s;tant religion&mdash;the checks lately given to negro &s;lavery&mdash;the general unwilling|ne&s;s among us to acknowledge the u&s;ur|pations of primogeniture &mdash; the addition of Canada to the Briti&s;h empire &mdash; the univer&s;al practice of inoculation for the &s;mall-pox&mdash;and the ab&s;ence of the plague, render the interpo&s;ition of government for that purpo&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THESE advantages can only be &s;ecured to our country by AGRICULTURE. This is the true ba&s;is of national health, riches and populou&s;ne&s;s. Nations, like indivi|duals, never ri&s;e higher than when they are ignorant whither they are tending. It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell from hi&s;tory, what will be the effects of agriculture&mdash;indu&s;|try &mdash; temperance and commerce, urged
<PB N="71" REF="013592_0068_0F91442C9A9F9CE0">on by the competition of colonies, unit|ed in the &s;ame general pur&s;uits, in a country, which, for extent&mdash;variety of &s;oil&mdash;climate&mdash;and number of navigable rivers, has never been equalled in any quarter of the globe. America is the thea|tre where human nature will probably receive her la&s;t and principal literary, ci|vil and military honors.</P>
<P>BUT I recall my&s;elf from the ages of futurity. The province of Penn&s;ylva|nia has already &s;howed her &s;i&s;ter colonies, the influence of agriculture and com|merce upon the number and happine&s;s of a people. It is &s;carcely an hundred years &s;ince our illu&s;trious legi&s;lator, with a handful of men, landed upon the&s;e &s;hores. Although the perfection of our government, the healthine&s;s of our cli|mate, and the fertility of our &s;oil, &s;eem|ed to en&s;ure a rapid &s;ettlement of the province; yet it would have required a pre&s;cience bordering upon divine, to have foretold, that in &s;uch a &s;hort &s;pace of time, the province would contain above 300,000 inhabitants; and that near 30,000 of this number &s;hould compo&s;e a city,
<PB N="72" REF="013592_0069_0F91442D3ADB94C8">which &s;hould be the third, if not the &s;econd in commerce in the Briti&s;h em|pire. The pur&s;uits of literature, require lei&s;ure and a total rece&s;s from clearing fore&s;ts, planting, building, and all the common toils of &s;ettling a new country: But before the&s;e arduous works were ac|compli&s;hed, the SCIENCES, ever fond of the company of liberty and indu&s;try, cho&s;e this &s;pot for the &s;eat of their em|pire in this new world. Our COLLEGE, &s;o catholic in its foundation, and exten|&s;ive in its objects, already &s;ees her &s;ons executing offices in the highe&s;t depart|ments of &s;ociety. I have now the honor of &s;peaking in the pre&s;ence of a mo&s;t re&s;pectable number of philo&s;ophers &mdash; phy&s;icians &mdash; a&s;tronomers &mdash; botani&s;ts &mdash; patriots&mdash;and legi&s;lators; many of whom have already &s;eized the prizes of honor, which their ance&s;tors had allotted to a much later po&s;terity. Our fir&s;t offering had &s;carcely found its way into the temple of fame, when the olde&s;t &s;ocieties in Eu|rope turned their eyes upon us, expect|ing with impatience to &s;ee the mighty fabric of &s;cience, which like a well built arch, can only re&s;t upon the whole of
<PB N="73" REF="013592_0070_0F914430E1A330D8">its materials, completely fini&s;hed from the trea&s;ures of this unexplored quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>IT reflects equal honor upon our &s;oci|ety and the honourable a&s;&s;embly of our province, to acknowledge, that we have always found the latter willing to encou|rage by their patronage, and reward by their liberality, all our &s;chemes for pro|moting u&s;eful knowledge. What may we not expect from this harmony be|tween the &s;ciences and government! Methinks I &s;ee canals cut &mdash; rivers once impa&s;&s;able, rendered navigable&mdash;bridges erected &mdash; and roads improved, to facili|tate the exportation of grain.&mdash;I &s;ee the banks of our rivers vieing in fruitfulne&s;s with the banks of the river of Egypt.&mdash; I behold our farmers, nobles&mdash;our mer|chants, princes.&mdash;But I forbear&mdash;Ima|gination cannot &s;well with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I BEG leave to conclude, by deriving an argument from our connection with the legi&s;lature, to remind my auditors of the duty they owe to the &s;ociety. Pa|trioti&s;m and literature are here connected
<PB N="74" REF="013592_0071_0F9144321B8ED710">together; and a man cannot neglect the one, without being de&s;titute of the other. Nature and our ance&s;tors have completed their works among us; and have left us nothing to do, but to enlarge and per|petuate our own happine&s;s.</P>

<P>MURATORI, in his antiquities of Italy in the middle ages, de&s;cribes the greate&s;t part of Europe as overflowed with wa|ter. The phy&s;icians and hi&s;torians of tho&s;e ages, are full of the phy&s;ical and political mi&s;eries which prevailed during tho&s;e centuries. The whole of the di&s;|ea&s;es we have mentioned, raged at one time in all the countries of Europe. In the ninth century, there were 19,000 ho&s;pitals for lepers only, in Chri&s;ten|dom. Lewis VIII. king of France, in the year 1227, bequeathed legacies to 2000 leprous ho&s;pitals in his own king|dom. The &s;ame diet, and the &s;ame dampne&s;s of &s;oil and air, produced the &s;ame effects in South-America. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e probably made its appearance at the &s;ame time, in South-America and Naples. Pre|cis de l'Hi&s;toire phy&s;ique des tems, par M. Raymond.

Between the years 1006 and 1680, we read of the plague being epidemic fifty-two times throughout all Europe. The &s;ituation of Europe is well known during the fourteenth century: every country was in arms; agriculture was neglected; nouri&s;hment of all kinds was &s;canty and unwhol&s;ome; no won|der, therefore, that we read of the plague being fourteen times epidemic in Europe during that period. In proportion as the nations of Europe have civilized, and cultivated the earth, together with the arts of peace, this di&s;order has gradually mitigated. It prevailed only &s;ix times in the &s;ixteenth, and five times in the &s;e|venteenth centuries: it made its la&s;t ge|neral appearance in the year 1680: it has occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited &s;everal cities in Eu|rope within the la&s;t century; but has raged with much le&s;s violence than for|merly. It is highly probable its very ex|i&s;tence would be de&s;troyed, could the in|habitants of Turkey (where it is at all times endemic) be prevailed upon to u&s;e

That the u&s;e of wine alone does not pre&s;erve them from the infection, we learn from the hi&s;tory of the Armenians, who drink large quantities of wine; and yet, from their belief in the doctrine of fatali&s;m, peri&s;h in the &s;ame proportion as the Turks.</P>

Dr. Cotton Mather, in a letter to Sir William A&s;hur&s;t, printed in Bo&s;ton in the year 1705, &s;ays, "That about five years before, there were about thirty Indian congregations in the &s;outh|ern parts of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay." The &s;ame author, in his Hi&s;tory of New-England, &s;ays, "That in the i&s;lands of Nantucket and Mar|tha's Vineyard there were 3000 <HI>adult</HI> Indians, 1600 of whom profe&s;&s;ed the

<P>THE fir&s;t regular practitioners of phy|&s;ic in Rome, were women and &s;laves. The profe&s;&s;ion was confined to them above &s;ix hundred years. The Romans during this period lived chiefly upon ve|getables, particularly upon PULSE; and hence they were called, by their neigh|bours, PULTIFAGI. They were likewi&s;e early inured to the healthy employments of war and hu&s;bandry. Their di&s;ea&s;es, of cour&s;e, were too few and &s;imple to render the cure of them an object of a liberal profe&s;&s;ion. When their di&s;ea&s;es became more numerous and complicated, their inve&s;tigation and cure required the aids of philo&s;ophy. The profe&s;&s;ion from this time became liberal; and maintained a rank with the other profe&s;&s;ions, which are founded upon the imperfection and depravity of human in&s;titutions.

<P>HOSPITALS were intended originally to accommodate &s;trangers, who might happen to meet with accidents: they are therefore nece&s;&s;ary in all large and commercial cities. Philadelphia claims the honor of being the fir&s;t and only ci|ty in America, that has founded an in|&s;titution for that purpo&s;e. The Penn|&s;ylvania-Ho&s;pital is as perfect as the wi&s;|dom and benevolence of man can make it. The following account, drawn up by the judicious Mr. James Hutchin&s;on, the apothecary of the ho&s;pital, of &s;ome of the di&s;ea&s;es of the patients, who were admitted into it between February 24, 1773 and the 24th of the &s;ame month 1774, may &s;erve to &s;how the other ci|ties in America how far our example is worthy of their imitation. Out of 435 patients, only thirty were admitted upon the account of accidents: 138 were af|flicted

<P>IT will not be foreign to our &s;ubject to take notice in this place, that the air &mdash;diet, and attendance in ho&s;pitals, ren|der them extremely improper in fevers; hence we always find them attended with more malignity or ob&s;tinacy in &s;uch places, than in private hou&s;es. The au|thor of the "Police of France" &s;ays, that one-fifth of the patients die, who are &s;ent to the Hotel Dieu; and &s;uppo&s;es, that one-third of the people who die in Paris every year, peri&s;h in ho&s;pitals. It mu&s;t be acknowledged however, that much of this mortality in the ho&s;pitals in Paris, is occa&s;ioned by the patients being too much crouded together; for in St. Thomas and St. Bartholomew's Ho&s;pitals in London, where the patients
<PB N="101" REF="013592_0097_0F914453889B6268">are le&s;s crouded, and better accommo|dated with nur&s;es&mdash;phy&s;icians&mdash;diet, &amp;c. only one-thirteenth of them die.

The &s;ame practice has been &s;ince adopted in many countries, with &s;ingular advantages to individuals and the community: the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able to the former, is the pre&s;ervation of an <HI>independance of &s;pirit</HI>; which is al|ways laid a&s;ide after a patient has had his poverty expo&s;ed to public view in an ho&s;pital. Nothing abridges a man more of his liberty, than a &s;en&s;e of his obli|gations to the public. It was probably to maintain a &s;pirit of freedom, &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to ju&s;t &s;entiments and actions, that our Saviour enjoins us not to let our left-hand know what our right-hand does, in our acts of charity: it is in other words, to command us, not to make a &s;lave of a fellow-creature. A German prince, who&s;e extraordinary
<PB N="102" REF="013592_0098_0F91445502782420">character has long fixed the attention of all Europe, has forbidden, from an affect|ed &s;ympathy, the operation of amputa|tion to be performed upon the limbs of his &s;oldiers, who are wounded in battle.

<P>THE principal employments of the Jews, like tho&s;e of the Romans in their &s;imple ages, con&s;i&s;ted in war and hu&s;|bandry. Their diet was plain, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of vegetables. Their only reme|dies were pla&s;ters and ointments; which were calculated for tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which are produced by accidents. In propor|tion as they receded from their &s;imple cu&s;toms, we find artificial di&s;ea&s;es pre|vail among them. The lepro&s;y made its appearance in their journey through the wilderne&s;s. King A&s;a's pains in his feet,
<PB N="105" REF="013592_0101_0F914456E09650D0">were probably brought on by a fit of the gout. Saul and Nebuchadnezzar were afflicted with a melancholy.

<P>IT has been urged again&s;t the middle and northern colonies of America, that there are fewer old people to be found in them, than in &s;everal of the European countries. This has been attributed to the weakne&s;s of our &s;tamina; which ap|pears chiefly in the premature DECAY of
<PB N="107" REF="013592_0103_0F91445C2F284FB8">our TEETH. In order to confute this opinion, it will not be foreign to our purpo&s;e to enquire into the cau&s;e of this di&s;order, and to &s;how that it is no proof of the weakne&s;s of our &s;tamina. 1. Bad teeth are ob&s;erved in all middle lati|tudes, which are &s;ubject to alternate heats and colds. The inhabitants of Nor|way and Ru&s;&s;ia are as remarkable for their &s;ound teeth, as the inhabitants of Africa. 2. The teeth are provided with nerves and blood-ve&s;&s;els; and hence they are &s;ubject to inflammation, in common with other parts of the body; and in a more <HI>e&s;pecial</HI> manner, from the alternate application of hot and cold liquors to them; and from the practice of &s;leeping with our heads uncovered in the winter &s;ea&s;on, while, at the &s;ame time, every o|ther part of the body is involved in a bath of warm per&s;piration. 3. The pain and inflammation of the teeth generally pre|cede their decay. The pain is &s;oon &s;uc|ceeded by the ordinary termination of inflammation in a bone, that is by a caries. The carious teeth are after|wards more expo&s;ed to inflammation; which generally extends it&s;elf to the
<PB N="108" REF="013592_0104_0F91445DDB53F4D8">&s;ound teeth which adjoin them. 4. The tooth-ach happens in the period, and &s;ea&s;ons of inflammatory di&s;orders. 5. We ob&s;erve tho&s;e people, who are mo&s;t &s;ubject to inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, to be mo&s;t afflicted with the tooth-ach: hence we find more bad teeth in the country, than in our cities. From the&s;e facts we infer, that the decay of the teeth in the Americans, is not occa&s;ioned by the pe|culiar weakne&s;s of their &s;tamina. It does not come on in the decline, but in the mo&s;t robu&s;t period of life. It can prove the means of &s;hortening life, only by rendering the ma&s;tication of our food le&s;s complete. The Europeans, who pa&s;s the &s;ea&s;on for inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es in this country, are as &s;ubject to the tooth-ach as the Americans. They alone are not &s;ubject to it, who arrive here beyond the thirtieth or thirty-&s;ixth year of their lives.</P>
<P>WE may learn from what has been advanced, that &s;ugar&mdash;&s;alt&mdash;tea&mdash;animal food, and &s;pirituous liquors, which have, all in their turns, been accu&s;ed of rot|ting the teeth, act only by weakening the &s;y&s;tem; and thus rendering it more
<PB N="109" REF="013592_0105_0F91445DF985EFD8">liable to tho&s;e <HI>partial</HI> colds or inflamma|tions, which precede the decay of the teeth.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that the teeth &s;ometimes decay without being accom|panied with any pain. This mu&s;t be at|tributed to a &s;crophula: &mdash; a di&s;ea&s;e not unknown to the bones in other parts of the body.</P>
<P>I CANNOT di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, with|out &s;ugge&s;ting an hint for preventing the teeth from decaying. The Indians, even in the middle latitudes of North-America, while they live agreeable to na|ture, are never troubled with the lea&s;t di&s;order in their teeth; but become &s;ub|ject to the tooth-ach as &s;oon as they ac|commodate them&s;elves to our modes of life. It is in vain to attempt to harden our&s;elves again&s;t the action of the cold, while we continue en&s;laved to &s;o many enfeebling cu&s;toms. This is the rea&s;on why the cold bath has often been u&s;ed for many years to the head, without having any effect in preventing the de|cay of the teeth. In&s;tead of this; would
<PB N="110" REF="013592_0106_0F91445EC1E4E4D0">it not be a better practice, to afford the head the &s;ame &s;ecurity from the action of of the cold, which we give to the other parts of the body? It is a fa&s;hion among both &s;exes in France, to &s;leep in LARGE WOOLLEN CAPS. I hope I do not attri|tribute too much to the&s;e, when I add, that the French people owe their fine teeth entirely to them.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid further again&s;t the &s;tate of longevity in America, that the Europeans, who &s;ettle among us, gene|rally arrive to a greater age than the A|mericans. This is not occa&s;ioned &s;o much by a peculiar firmne&s;s in their &s;tamina, as by an encrea&s;e of vigor, which the con&s;titution acquires by a change of cli|mate. A Frenchman (caeteris paribus) outlives an Engli&s;hman in his own coun|try. An Hollander prolongs his life by removing to the Cape of Good Hope. A Portugue&s;e gains fifteen or twenty years, by removing to Brazil. And there are good rea&s;ons to believe, that a North-American would derive the &s;ame advan|tages, in point of health and longevity, by removing to Europe, which an Eu|ropean

<P>FROM a calculation made by an inge|nious foreigner, it appears, that a greater proportion of old people are to be found in Connecticut, than in any colony in America. This colony contains 180,000 inhabitants. They have no public ho&s;|pitals or poor hou&s;es; nor is a beggar to be &s;een among them: there cannot be more &s;triking proofs than the&s;e facts, of the &s;implicity of their manners.</P>
<P>IT was by the operation of natural cau&s;es, that the divine prediction was accompli&s;hed, which reduced the ages of the children of I&s;rael &s;o much in the wilderne&s;s, that out of 21,200 none of them were above &s;ixty years of age, ex|cept Mo&s;es&mdash;Caleb and Jo&s;hua, who had not conformed to the enervating vices of the heathen, among whom they had &s;ojourned.</P>
<P>THE decay of the faculties of the mind in old people, is generally produced by
<PB N="112" REF="013592_0108_0F9144603B3D5438">&s;ome adventitious cau&s;es, not nece&s;&s;arily connected with civilization. We find no account of the amentia &s;enilis, or &s;econd childhood among the Jews. Mo&s;es read without &s;pectacles, when he was 120 years of age; and the inimitable &s;ong he compo&s;ed a little before his death &s;hows, that the hi&s;torian &s;poke the truth when he &s;aid, that his "natural force was not abated."</P>

<P>PARTURITION, in the &s;imple ages of all countries, is performed by nature. The I&s;raeliti&s;h women were delivered even without the help of the Egyptian midwives. We read of but one woman who died in childbirth in the whole hi&s;|tory of the Jews; and her death was probably brought on by the fatigue of her journey in travelling from Bethel to Ephrath. Dr. Bancroft &s;ays, that child-bearing is attended with &s;o little pain in Guiana, that the women &s;eem to be ex|empted from the cur&s;e inflicted upon Eve. The&s;e ea&s;y births are not confined
<PB N="113" REF="013592_0109_0F9144611F7E64A8">to warm climates. They are equally &s;afe and ea&s;y in Norway and Iceland, accord|ing to Pontoppidan's and Ander&s;on's natural hi&s;tories of tho&s;e countries.</P>

<P>CIVILIZED nations have, in the end, always conquered &s;avages as much by their ability to bear hard&s;hips, as by their &s;uperior military &s;kill. Soldiers are not to be cho&s;en indi&s;criminately. The greate&s;t generals have looked upon &s;ound con&s;titutions to be as e&s;&s;ential to &s;ol|diers, as bravery or military di&s;cipline. Count Saxe refu&s;ed &s;oldiers born and bred in large cities; and &s;ought for &s;uch only as were bred in mountainous coun|tries. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia calls young &s;oldiers only to the dangers and honors of the field in his elegant poem, Sur l'Art de la Guerre, Chant. I. Old &s;ol|diers generally lo&s;e the advantages of their veterani&s;m, by their habits of idle|ne&s;s and debauchery. An able general, and experienced officers, will always &s;up|ply the defect of age in young &s;oldiers.</P>

<P>BEFORE we compare the &s;tate of mor|tality of &s;avages, with the bills of mor|tality among civilized nations, we &s;hall promi&s;e, that fruitfulne&s;s in either &s;ex, is not exchanged for the &s;imple cu&s;toms of civilization. Civilized, have always been more populous than &s;avage nations. The fruitfulne&s;s of the Jews, although the con&s;equence of a divine promi&s;e, was produced by the operation of natu|ral cau&s;es, which produce the &s;ame ef|fects in all countries. Let the unfruitful pair retire for a while from the pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures of a city life: let them vi|&s;it the cottage of the pea&s;ant, or walk along &s;hores inhabited by fi&s;hermen, and they will find that &s;timulating food &mdash; wine &mdash; &s;pices &mdash; phy&s;ic &mdash; voyages to &s;ea, and journies to Bath &mdash; Spaw &mdash; Black-Point, &amp;c. are not the proper remedies for barrenne&s;s; but that they are to be found only in SIMPLE DIET and CON|STANT LABOR.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="013592_0111_0F914464E255EAC0">WE have no way of a&s;certaining the proportion of tho&s;e who die yearly among the Indians; but we may pre&s;ume it to be con&s;iderable, when we reflect on the mortality they are expo&s;ed to from accidents&mdash;hunger, and fevers. The ef|fects of the&s;e are mitigated, or entirely prevented by civilization. Dr. Price computes, that from one nineteeenth or one twentieth to one twenty-third or one twenty-fourth peri&s;h yearly in large towns &mdash; from one twenty-third to one twenty-eighth in modetate towns, and from one thirtieth or one thirty-fifth to one fiftieth or one &s;ixtieth in country places. The bill of mortality in Bo&s;ton amounted la&s;t year to 533. &mdash; which is about one thirty-fourth of the number of inhabitants (&s;aid to be 18,000) contained in that town. The city of Philadelphia buried la&s;t year near 1400: out of the&s;e 360 were buried in the Strangers Grave Yard; the chief of whom were &s;trangers from Britain, Ireland, and Germany: they died of fevers contracted on their pa&s;&s;age, or &s;oon after their arrival in the city. Many &s;trangers, likewi&s;e, from the We&s;t-Indies and the &s;outhern colo|nies,
<PB N="116" REF="013592_0112_0F914466081E6E20">were buried in the church-yards belonging to the different denominations of Chri&s;tians. The &s;mall-pox (which &s;hould not be numbered in the &s;tationary di&s;ea&s;es of a country) contributed a good deal to &s;well the la&s;t year's bill of mor|tality. One-fourth of all who died in Chri&s;t's and St. Peter's pari&s;hes, and in the Scots Pre&s;byterian congregation, peri&s;hed with that di&s;order. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, joined with our uncertainty of the exact number of inhabitants, ren|der it impo&s;&s;ible, as yet, to a&s;certain the proportion who die yearly in Philadel|phia.</P>
<P>I HAVE already hinted at the means of re&s;training the artificial di&s;ea&s;es of our city: I &s;hall conclude, by &s;ugge&s;ting a few hints for re&s;training our natural di&s;ea&s;es. A large &s;hare of the&s;e, are compo&s;ed of the intermitting &mdash; remitting &mdash; bilious and nervous fevers, which prevail chiefly in the months of Augu&s;t, September, and October. Under the head of the&s;e fevers, we include the VOMITING and PURGING of children. It comes on at the &s;ame &s;ea|&s;on, is attended with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms,
<PB N="117" REF="013592_0113_0F9144663AF4B660">and yields to the &s;ame method of cure. The&s;e facts are &s;ufficient to &s;how, that it is not a cholera morbus, nor produced by teething or worms.</P>
<P>DISEASES are generated in one &s;ea&s;on, and produced in another. To prevent this dy&s;enteric fever &s;o fatal to children, they &s;hould be &s;ent into the country about the beginning of June, where they &s;hould &s;tay till the middle of Augu&s;t, or beginning of September. Their diet, during the &s;ickly months, &s;hould be more generous than is con&s;i&s;tent with the com|mon rules laid down in our &s;y&s;tems of education. It is worthy of notice, that the children of opulent families, who are provided with country &s;eats, and who indulge their children with &s;ipping the remains of a gla&s;s of &s;ound wine now and then after dinner, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure exempted from this di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE intermitting fever prevails chiefly in the &s;uburbs. To guard again&s;t this, fires &s;hould be made in the common &s;it|ting rooms; and great care taken to avoid the night air.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="013592_0114_0F9144670710E620">IT were to be wi&s;hed, that &s;trangers would embark for this part of America earlier in the year, &s;o that they might arrive here in the Spring, or beginning of Summer. It has been remarked, that a crew, who have been healthy during the greate&s;t part of their pa&s;&s;age, often become &s;ickly when they come upon our coa&s;t, or &s;oon after they arrive in the ci|ty. This is probably occa&s;ioned by their being expo&s;ed to exhalations from the land. To avoid the&s;e, it would be pro|per to oblige the pa&s;&s;engers to &s;hun the night-air; and, at the &s;ame time, to im|pregnate the hold and deck of the &s;hip with the vapor of vinegar, as al&s;o with brim&s;tone &mdash; gunpowder &mdash; and the other &s;ub&s;tances commonly u&s;ed to correct a morbid atmo&s;phere.</P>
