<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE utility of accurate Hi&s;tories of Epidemics to the improvement of medicine, has never been doubted from the time of the early and valuable pub|lications of Hypocrates, to the late and no le&s;s judi|cious ob&s;ervations of Dr. Ru&s;h: but as the Yellow Fever has been &s;o accurately and fully de&s;cribed and treated of by &s;everal phy&s;icians in the We&s;t-Indies, in Philadelphia, &amp;c. it may be thought entirely &s;uper|fluous to give any account of it as it appeared in this city. Fully &s;en&s;ible of the force of this remark, I long declined attempting any thing of the kind; but as &s;everal facts have occurred to me, a general know|ledge of which I con&s;ider as highly intere&s;ting to hu|manity and of importance to the community at large, and e&s;pecially to the inhabitants of this city, I am finally induced to &s;ubmit them to the con&s;ideration of the public, particularly as the Medical Society, which had made &s;ome progre&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s, have declined the pro&s;ecution of it.</P>
<P>THE many accounts and complete de&s;criptions al|ready given of this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eem to render it unne|ce&s;&s;ary to enter into a minute detail of its &s;everal &s;ymptoms in this place; I have therefore been very &s;hort upon that part of the &s;ubject, referring the more

nice inquirer to the beforementioned authors, particu|larly to Dr. Ru&s;h's account of it, as it appeared in Philadelphia, in 1793, where he will find its various appearances very particularly and accurately deli|neated.</P>
<P>As the following ob&s;ervations have originated al|mo&s;t entirely from facts and circum&s;tances of the di&s;|ea&s;e, as it appeared in this city; the reader will find him&s;elf much deceived, if he looks for references to long catalogues of eminent authors, or for an elabo|rate account of the di&s;ea&s;es of the We&s;t-Indies, pe&s;|tilences of Europe, or plagues of A&s;ia: and as my conclu&s;ions are drawn chiefly from ca&s;es and occur|ances, that have come within my own per&s;onal know|ledge, (which favored by my local &s;ituation in the center of the Epidemic, and my providential pre&s;er|vation from its influence, till it was nearly extingui&s;h|ed, were con&s;iderably numerous) he will al&s;o find that my remarks have not been much either influ|enced or &s;upported by the uncertain communication of my brother practitioners or other citizens; hence, if decided and undoubted facts, &s;hall hereafter appear which &s;hall di&s;prove them, my error &s;hould be a&s;&s;ign|ed only to my general &s;ceptici&s;m re&s;pecting current medical reports, and the limited nature that I have impo&s;ed upon my &s;ources of information.</P>
<P>As &s;ome thoughts which I have advanced, are de|cidedly oppo&s;ed to the <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> of the faculty in

general, I wi&s;h it to be con&s;idered, that they are not the offspring of any favorite theory, or influential hypothe&s;is; for I had heretofore been taught and be|lieved very differently, till the &s;tubborn obtru&s;ion of facts upon my mind, forced me to change my opi|nion.</P>
<P>I AM well aware of the lo&s;s of reputation that I may &s;u&s;tain, from attempting, in the cour&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay, to &s;upport opinions which are very unpopular with the inhabitants of this city; however, the im|portance of the &s;ubject, has &s;wallowed up all per&s;o|nal con&s;iderations, and determined me freely to com|municate what I con&s;ider as highly e&s;&s;ential to their welfare; and I &s;hall be richly paid, if my temerity &s;hall in the lea&s;t degree, tend to the prevention of a di&s;ea&s;e, which in its <HI>partial</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It being chiefly confined to a particular part of the city.</NOTE> operation, in le&s;s than three months, &s;wept off upwards of &s;even hundred of our fellow-citizens; which &s;hould be &s;ufficiently alarming to put us upon our guard in future, for &s;hould it again ari&s;e, in a &s;ea&s;on more favorable to its &s;preading, perhaps its more <HI>univer&s;al</HI> deva&s;tation will not be checked till it has numbered thou&s;ands in its mortal li&s;t.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the State of the Air, and Di&s;ea&s;es preceding and accompanying the Epidemic, and a Hi&s;tory of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the tables of Meteorological ob&s;erva|tions, in&s;erted immediately before the con&s;iderations on the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, it appears, that in the be|ginning of the &s;ixth month (June) the weather was pretty warm, but became more moderate on the &s;eventh and eighth days, and that its temperature was &s;uddenly increa&s;ed on the 9th of the month, rai&s;ing the Mercury 12&frac12; degrees in Fahrenheit's thermome|ter in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours; it was warm on the tenth, then became cooler for four or five days, after which time it continued very warm and &s;ultry for &s;everal days; on the 19th the thermometer &s;tood at 87&deg;, and varied between that and 69&deg; the re|mainder of this month&mdash;we had rains on the 2d, 11th, 20th, 24th, 25th, and 30th. The mean tem|perature of this month was 73&deg;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were the &s;tates of the thermometer at one o'clock, P. M.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="031169_0008_0feb11aa12104098">It gradually became cooler for the fir&s;t five days in the &s;eventh month (July); on the 6th the mercury ro&s;e to 83&deg;, which was 13&deg;&punc; higher than it &s;tood the day before; the next day it fell to 72&deg;; after which, in the cour&s;e of &s;ix days, it ro&s;e to 89&deg; without any material &s;udden change; the weather then moderated in &s;ome degree, &s;o that in the la&s;t nine days of this month it did not ri&s;e above the 80&deg; and in one of them it &s;tood at 68&deg;&mdash;the mean temperature of this month was 81&deg;: it rained on the 3d, 10th, 18th, 23d, 24th, 27th, 30th, and 31&s;t.</P>
<P>The thermometer &s;tood near 90&deg; mo&s;t of the time during the fir&s;t ten days of the eighth month (Au|gu&s;t); on one day it was upwards of 93&deg;; in the re|mainder of the month it varied between the 60th and 88th&deg;&mdash;great part of this time it was above 80&deg;, and there were but a few days wherein it was below 72&deg;; the medium temperature of this month was 83&deg;; we had rains on the 3d, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 20th, 21&s;t, 23d, and 31&s;t days, and &s;everal of them were very great.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t week in the ninth month (September) the mercury remained between 70 and 75&deg;; in the &s;econd and third week it varied but little, one way or the other, from 80&deg;; but we had &s;ome cool days in the latter part of the month, the mercury being as low as 58&deg; on the 22d and on the 30th; mean tem|perature about 73&deg;; we had five rainy days, viz. the 2d, 7th, 13th, 19th, and 20th.</P>
<P>In the tenth month (October) the temperature of the air was at no time above 75&deg;, but varied between that and 49&deg; irregularly; the mean temperature was 62&deg; the latter part of this month we frequently had white fro&s;ts at night; it rained on the 10th, 20th, and 31&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="031169_0009_0feb11ad208005c8">Mu&s;quetoes were never before known, by the old|e&s;t inhabitants, to have been &s;o numerous as at this &s;ea&s;on, e&s;pecially in the &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of the city; they were particularly trouble&s;ome to foreign|ers, many of whom, had tho&s;e parts of their bodies that were expo&s;ed to them, covered with bli&s;ters from their venomous operations.</P>
<P>Our &s;ummer fruits in general were no ways extra|ordinary; water-melons particularly, from the wet|ne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, were very fla&s;hy and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>It was remarked that many laborers employed at the different buildings, gave out at their work, from the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the weather.</P>
<P>An unu&s;ual number of per&s;ons &s;uffered in the warm part of the &s;eventh and eighth months, from drinking cold water; and &s;everal fell down and died in the &s;treets, who&s;e deaths were a&s;&s;igned to that cau&s;e, when it more probably was induced by an apo|plexy, brought on by the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;un; one ca&s;e came under my particular ob&s;ervation which was certainly of that kind, although currently report|ed otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>cholera infantum,</HI> was very common in the early part of the <HI>&s;ixth month,</HI> and increa&s;ed as the weather became warmer. <HI>Bilious cholics</HI> and <HI>dy&s;en|teries</HI> became very prevalent in the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> and <HI>eighth months.</HI> At this time al&s;o the <HI>cholera morbus</HI> carried off a number of grown per&s;ons.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the <HI>ninth month,</HI> the mea&s;les made their appearance, but they &s;uddenly vani&s;hed with the above mentioned di&s;ea&s;es, as &s;oon as the <HI>yellow fever</HI> had &s;pread it&s;elf among us: I did not
<PB N="4" REF="031169_0010_0feb11b01c53d4c0">
ob&s;erve but a &s;ingle ca&s;e of it during the dominion of this powerful epidemic.</P>
<P>The common <HI>remitting bilious fever,</HI> was no ways uncommon in the &s;ummer months, but this al&s;o gave way, or rather perhaps, run into the <HI>yellow fever,</HI> as that gained ground in the city.</P>
<P>As early as the &s;ixth of the <HI>&s;eventh month,</HI> I was called upon in conjunction with Dr. Treat, then health-officer to our port, to vi&s;it Thomas Fo&s;ter, a patient brought into the alms-hou&s;e, whom we found affected with all the full marked and decided &s;ymptoms of an highly <HI>malignant yellow fever;</HI> the adnata of his eyes and his &s;kin were of a bright yel|low, the latter covered with purple &s;pots, his mind deranged, his tongue covered with a dry black &s;or|des, with hemorrhages from his gums and no&s;e, and a di&s;charge of black and very offen&s;ive matter from his &s;tomach and bowels; he died on the ninth.</P>
<P>Dr. Treat was taken on the 22d of the <HI>&s;eventh month,</HI> and died on the 30th. Several other un|doubted ca&s;es occurred, about this time, in the neigh|borhood of Dover-&s;treet, but the fir&s;t one that came under my particular ob&s;ervation, was that of James Dalton on the 12th of the <HI>eighth month,</HI> then in the fifth day of his illne&s;s, of which he died the day fol|lowing as yellow as gold. From this time the di&s;|ea&s;e became more and more frequent; yet as we find by the accurate accounts of the Health Committee, not above two a day upon an average died of it, till the 24th of the month.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing prevalence of the epidemic at the upper part of Water-&s;treet and in Cherry-&s;treet, and in all the neighboring low ground between them and Chatham and the lower part of George-&s;treets, in
<PB N="5" REF="031169_0011_0feb11b2e75a18c0">
the forepart of the <HI>ninth month,</HI> became &s;o alarming as to drive many of the mo&s;t opulent of their inhabit|ants to the country, while the le&s;s prudent and the more indigent remained expo&s;ed to a di&s;ea&s;e, which, from this limited &s;pot, in le&s;s than three months, car|ried as many as five hundred to their graves.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e was not, however, confined <HI>entirely</HI> to this part of the city; for in every other &s;ituation, favoring the accumulation of filth and &s;tagnation of putrefactive materials, there it was no &s;tranger: it raged with peculiar violence in the vicinity of a mo&s;t intolerable pent up &s;ink, to the we&s;t of Peck-&s;lip, which is the receptacle for all the refu&s;e kitchen arti|cles, and yard wa&s;h of a number of lots fronting Pearl and Water-&s;treets, that back upon it; it was like|wi&s;e very prevalent in the neighborhood of the Fly-market, al&s;o in and about Skinner-&s;treet, as well as in &s;ome of the unregulated grounds on the north &s;ide of the town.</P>
<P>If an account of the epidemic, as it pervaded the different parts of the town, could be accurately a&s;|certained, and depicted in colors, heightened in pro|portion to the combined early time of attack, and the numbers affected, blazoned by its comparative ma|lignity, there can be no manner of doubt, but that the low ground in the &s;outhea&s;t of the city as above mentioned, would appear as the grand center of the calamity, diffu&s;ing its effects, like diverging rays, to the adjacent parts; aiding by its mo&s;t powerful influ|ence, different &s;econdary centers, already &s;moking hot, to flame out its pe&s;tiferous operations. The ma|ny &s;olitary ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e that have occurred in di&s;tant healthy &s;ituations, appear to have been kin|dled up by imprudent individual expo&s;ures too near the&s;e &s;ources of infection.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031169_0012_0feb11b48d7e77c0">The black people appeared to be as &s;ubject to the di&s;ea&s;e as the whites, but it was not &s;o fatal to them; of eight that I pre&s;cribed for, only one died, and with her, the complaint having &s;tolen in under the deceit|ful form of a common cynanche, was permitted to run on for &s;ome days, before medical aid was called for. By report of Dr. S. L. Mitchell, in behalf of a com|mittee of the Manumitting Society of this city, it ap|pears that not a &s;ingle &s;cholar of the free black &s;chool, under their patronage, died with it.</P>
<P>Several circum&s;tances tended to render the di&s;ea&s;e particularly fatal to the more indigent part of the community: 1&s;t. The higher prices of hou&s;e-rent in the other parts of the city, having concentered a great proportion of them in the epidemic neighborhood, and crouded them in very &s;mall confined apart|ments; a number of hou&s;es contained as many fa|milies as it had rooms in it. 2d. Their poverty not permitting them to quit their place of re&s;idence when the di&s;ea&s;e came around them. 3d. The great difficul|ty of getting nur&s;es, and their exorbitant prices pre|venting them from getting proper attendance before their &s;ituation became known to the Committee of Health, often-times a whole family being taken down about the &s;ame time, their panic &s;truck fair-day friends quitting them in their di&s;tre&s;s, from the fear of infection. 4th. The neglect of obtaining early medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from a hope that their di&s;ea&s;e was not the prevailing one: and 5th. The refu&s;al of ma|ny, after they were taken ill, thus mi&s;erably &s;ituated, to go to Belle Vue, "le&s;t (to u&s;e their own expre&s;&s;ion) they &s;hould catch the Yellow-Fever and die."</P>
<P>Foreigners who came from a more temperate cli|mate, as the Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h, Scotch, &amp;c. and people from the country, who had not long re&s;ided in town, were particularly obnoxious to this complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031169_0013_0feb11d0b1219360">The French from the We&s;t-Indies, &s;eemed proof again&s;t the influence of this epidemic, a numerous family of them continued in the mid&s;t of it, and view|ed without danger the death of a great many, and the di&s;ea&s;e of nearly all their neighbors who remain|ed in town; not one of them &s;uffered the lea&s;t in|di&s;po&s;ition: In another boarding hou&s;e of them, con|taining at lea&s;t thirty or forty per&s;ons, not far from Peck-&s;lip, not any of them took the complaint, al|though numbers of the other inhabitants were drop|ing away with it, on every &s;ide of them.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e &s;pared no age or &s;ex, although it was mo&s;t fatal to the young and tho&s;e in the prime of life.</P>

<HEAD>Symptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, as exhibited in the different parts and functions of the body.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>The vital functions</HI> &s;uffered extremely in the fir&s;t attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, it generally coming on with <HI>chillne&s;s,</HI> an anxious and interrupted <HI>re&s;piration,</HI> with a total <HI>ab&s;ence of per&s;piration;</HI> this however, in &s;ome in&s;tances, came on very copiou&s;ly, after the great heat that generally followed the chill, had exi&s;ted for a time, but in mo&s;t ca&s;es the &s;kin continued dry and parched, except a &s;weat was induced by artificial means.</P>
<P>The <HI>pul&s;e</HI> was as variable as the hues of the ca|meleon; in mo&s;t ca&s;es it was frequent, and after the chill had &s;ub&s;ided, it became &s;omewhat hard: yet in|&s;tances occurred of a preternatural &s;lowne&s;s. I met with one ca&s;e in a black man, where it beat only for|ty-two &s;trokes in a minute; and in another per&s;on there was a complete intermi&s;&s;ion of it in every twelfth or fifteenth pul&s;ation: and in other patients,
<PB N="8" REF="031169_0014_0feb11bb4e86c000">
particularly in the 3d or 4th day of their complaints, were phy&s;icians to judge from the pul&s;e alone, they would declare them in a convale&s;cent &s;tate, at the very time they were in the mo&s;t imminent danger and &s;ometimes within a few hours of their end. Al|though I firmly believe with my mo&s;t eminent teach|er Dr. Ru&s;h, that the pul&s;e is our be&s;t guide in the knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es, yet in no complaint that has ever occurred to my ob&s;ervation, have I found this mo&s;t &s;ure index of the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, &s;o little to be depended on. <HI>Hemorrhages</HI> from the no&s;e, gums, &s;tomach, uterus, &amp;c. were very common at the com|mencement, as well as in the more advanced peri|ods of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2d. In the ANIMAL FUNCTIONS this di&s;ea&s;e in its fir&s;t attack, produced <HI>la&s;&s;itude,</HI> and an aver&s;ion to all kind of bodily exertion with a &s;en&s;e of general <HI>debil|ity,</HI> attended with violent pains in the head and back, &s;ometimes &s;hooting down the legs: the&s;e fre|quently preceded the chills, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es ac|companied it and continued afterwards, as a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e. The mind was oftentimes very much <HI>dejected,</HI> with <HI>imperfect vi&s;ion and memory,</HI> followed by <HI>delirium, &s;ub&s;ultus, tendinum,</HI> &amp;c. before death.</P>

all fevers, was affected with a degree of nau&s;ea, and &s;ometimes vomiting at the fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of this di&s;|ea&s;e, which frequently &s;ub&s;ided for a while, but is &s;ucceeded about the third day, if proper means are not u&s;ed to prevent it, by an almo&s;t unconquerable irrita|bility and retrograde movement of this organ, throw|ing up large quantities of green or yellow bile, and re|jecting immediately every particle of medicine, food or drink, that was taken into it&mdash;afterwards di&s;charging an aquoeus fluid containing a number of light dun co|lored &s;pecks in it; this, if not checked, was followed by a puking of a fluid exactly re&s;embling coffee, with its grounds floating in it, which by &s;tanding, would &s;ettle to the bottom.</P>
<P>The vomiting which occurs about the third day, frequently, is the only di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom that the patient labors under, his pul&s;e becoming natural, &s;kin cool and moi&s;t, with an entire freedom from pain, and a perfect clearne&s;s in the mental opera|tions, that in&s;uperable circum&s;tance &s;tanding alone, as it were, to humble the pride of phy&s;ic, and to warn, in cool blood, the unhappy &s;ufferer of his precarious exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>A <HI>hiccoughing</HI> often was very trouble&s;ome in the dif|ferent &s;tages of this complaint. The <HI>bowels</HI> were very uniformly and ob&s;tinately <HI>co&s;tive:</HI> there were &s;ome ca,+&s;es it is true, that were attended with frequent evacu|ations, but the&s;e generally &s;eemed rather of a partial dy&s;entery nature, and not free di&s;charges from the whole cour&s;e of the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ecretion</HI> of <HI>bile</HI> was greatly increa&s;ed, as ap|peared by its copious di&s;charge from the &s;tomach in vomiting, as well as from the bowels when excited by proper purgatives. The flow of &s;aliva and excre|tions from the mouth and &s;auces were not much im|peded;

in the beginning the <HI>tongue</HI> appearing moi&s;t and a little white, after a few days it became more thickly furred and a&s;&s;umed a deeper hue, but fre|quently in the latter &s;tages it became quite dry and covered with a black cru&s;t.</P>
<P>The appearances on the <HI>&s;uperficies</HI> were various, the <HI>&s;kin</HI> oftentimes retained its natural appearance, but frequently, though not uniformly, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced, it a&s;&s;umed a yellow tinge. Mu&s;quetoe bites, which before had entirely di&s;appeared, &s;hewed them|&s;elves in all the parts that had been expo&s;ed to them, in &s;mall purplei&s;h red &s;pots; the&s;e were often taken for <HI>petechia,</HI> which &s;ometimes, but more rarely ap|peared.</P>
<P>Un&s;eemly &s;cabs, oftentimes in the latter &s;tages, formed about the mouth, which, on being &s;cratched off, frequently were followed by trouble&s;ome little hemorrhages. The&s;e eruptions did not in this fever as it does in others, indicate any favorable event of the complaint.</P>
<P>The <HI>adnata of the eyes,</HI> in the beginning where the attack was &s;evere, generally were tinged and &s;uffu&s;ed with a reddi&s;h color, changing with the &s;kin to a yel|low, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced: there were many, how|ever, even among tho&s;e who died, who&s;e &s;kin nor eyes &s;hewed the lea&s;t appearance of this color.</P>

<HEAD>DIAGNOSIS.</HEAD>
<P>If it &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, that this fever is as highly contagious as is, perhaps, too generally believed, its diagno&s;is or peculiar &s;ymptoms di&s;tingui&s;hing it from others, would become a matter of the greate&s;t im|portance, both to individual &s;afety and to the wel|fare of the community at large.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="031169_0017_0feb11c3b76f8740">This part of the &s;tudy of medicine has, of late, been con&s;idered of le&s;s con&s;equence than formerly, &s;ince the fallacy and imprudence of pre&s;cribing for the name of a di&s;ea&s;e, has been &s;o fully expo&s;ed and ju&s;tly condemned by the generality of phy&s;icians;&mdash; however, in this particular complaint, as the hopes of a cure depend, almo&s;t entirely, upon the means u&s;ed in the fir&s;t two or three days of its attack, it certainly mu&s;t be of prime nece&s;&s;ity to know it in its early &s;tage. We cannot be too careful in detecting the exi&s;tence of this di&s;ea&s;e, for in its commence|ment, its evident &s;ymptoms are oftentimes no way in proportion to the danger. Hence, as Dr. Jack&s;on ob&s;erves, (in his treati&s;e on the fevers of Jamaica) <Q>per&s;ons unacquainted with the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, would be di&s;po&s;ed to believe that the patient ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ufferings that were not real.</Q> And hence phy&s;icians are &s;ometimes led to neglect them till it is too late to &s;ave their patients.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tage of this fever it is oftentimes with difficulty di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common bilious re|mittent, its &s;ymptoms in general being exactly &s;imi|lar, only aggravated in degree; the pain in the head and back are more &s;evere and con&s;tant, and the re|mi&s;&s;ions, whenever they are ob&s;ervable, are more ob&s;cure: Tho&s;e who are well acquainted with the di&s;ea&s;e, may often recognize it by a certain unde&s;|cribeable appearance in the countenance of the &s;ick, the eye is often more red, and the face more flu&s;hed than the heat of the body and the general action of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, would lead us to expect.</P>
<P>The remarkable irritability of the &s;tomach, that generally comes on (when the di&s;ea&s;e is permitted to run an uninterrupted cour&s;e) about the third or fourth day, whereby a con&s;tant nau&s;ea and retchings

to vomit, immediately brings up every thing as &s;oon as &s;wallowed, &s;eems to be a pretty di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of this di&s;ea&s;e at this &s;tage of it.</P>
<P>The yellow &s;kin, and coffee ground or black vomit|ings, as they &s;ometimes occur in the more advanced &s;tage, may be looked upon as decided and unequivo|cal evidences of this complaint; but they cannot be con&s;idered as <HI>pathognomic &s;ymptoms,</HI> for although they are to be found in this fever only, yet in the great|e&s;t proportion of ca&s;es they do not attend it.</P>
<P>The prevailing epidemic &s;hould always have a great influence in fixing our judgment with re&s;pect to this, as well as other di&s;ea&s;es. Whenever it is found, from decided ca&s;es, that it really exi&s;ts in any particular &s;ituation, I &s;hould con&s;ider every fever, in that neigh|borhood, attended with aggravated &s;ymptoms of a common bilious remittent, to be of this kind; for I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the powerful operation of its cau&s;e, would certainly predominate over the milder cau&s;es of more moderate maladies.</P>

<HEAD>PROGNOSIS.</HEAD>
<P>The progno&s;is is to be drawn from the di&s;po&s;ition and con&s;titution of the per&s;ons affected, as well as from the particular &s;ymptoms. Tho&s;e who had been much debilitated by previous di&s;ea&s;e, great anxiety of mind, drunkenne&s;s, &amp;c. mo&s;t generally admitted of but an unfavorable pro&s;pect as to the event of this di&s;ea&s;e, as likewi&s;e did the re&s;olute and hardy, who would not early &s;ubmit to their complaints, but en|deavored to &s;hake them off as they would a common catarrh. I u&s;ed to warn &s;uch ones at my fir&s;t vi&s;its, that I feared from their di&s;po&s;itions, that they would undertake to wre&s;tle with their di&s;ea&s;e, and that if they did they would &s;urely fall under it, and unfor|tunately
<PB N="13" REF="031169_0019_0feb11c82a41f288">
their conduct too often verified my fears and ju&s;tified my progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>In the early &s;tages of the complaint, if it came on very moderately, without much affection of the head, if the eyes and countenance were not much affected, and the bowels were ea&s;ily moved by the medicines hereafter to be mentioned, we, in general, were war|ranted in pronouncing a favorable termination. But when the face and eyes were &s;uffu&s;ed with a reddi&s;h tinge, or great di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety were expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance, with &s;evere pain in the head and back, we had great cau&s;e to fear the con&s;equences, particularly if the bowels were ob&s;tinately con&s;tipat|ed; this la&s;t circum&s;tance, in every in&s;tance, por|tended the greate&s;t danger; indeed, it &s;eemed to me that the degree of danger was, very generally, in proportion to the &s;tubbornne&s;s of the con&s;triction of the&s;e vi&s;cera and their in&s;en&s;ibility to the impre&s;&s;ion of purgative medicines.</P>
<P>In the latter &s;tages of the complaint, when the con&s;tant vomiting came on, there was always great danger to be apprehended; yet &s;ome have recovered after di&s;charging the coffee ground like matter before|mentioned, but the&s;e ca&s;es were confe&s;&s;edly very rare.</P>
<P>The other &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency, as a black tongue, petichiae, &amp;c. were generally unfavorable, although I did not find hemorrhages &s;uch terrible occurences as they are, by the generality of authors, &s;tated to be. In the ninth month (September) 24th, in a communication to the Committee of Health, among other things, I ob&s;erved, that <Q>in taking a retro&s;pective view of my different patients with the prevailing complaint, I found among them five who had had hemorrhages, either from the no&s;e,

gums, &s;tomach or uterus, and one who had lo&s;t &s;ome blood from an accidental wound in his head; the&s;e were all the patients that I had attended, who had been affected with any hemorrhage what|ever, neither of them had died, three had recover|ed, and the other three were much better than they had been.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e three al&s;o afterwards recovered; neverthele&s;s, &s;ome patients afterwards died, who&s;e complaints were attended with hemorrhages; &s;till the&s;e facts prove that they do not indicate &s;o much danger as is commonly believed.</P>
<P>Having given a cur&s;ory account of the &s;ea&s;on im|mediately preceding and during the continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e, and al&s;o a hi&s;tory of its mo&s;t material &s;ymptoms, together with the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential circum|&s;tances re&s;pecting its diagno&s;is and progno&s;is, I pro|ceed to &s;tate &s;ome facts and free thoughts relative to a que&s;tion, in my opinion highly intere&s;ting to the cau&s;e of humanity, and greatly important to the community, for on it depends the welfare of the af|flicted individual, as well as the method of prevent|ing or eradicating the di&s;ea&s;e in general, viz.</P>

<P N="2">2d.

nature, find their doctrine requires that it mu&s;t be permitted to act at any time, between that of the expo&s;ure and the &s;ixteenth day, otherwi&s;e it would not embrace ca&s;es enough to give it a curren|cy. This &s;eems to be allowing them&s;elves great la|titude, as there are but few per&s;ons during the pre|valence of an epidemic in their neighborhood, that avoid every kind of connection or near approach to the di&s;ea&s;ed for as much as &s;ixteen days together. Might not intermittents, when they occur generally in the vicinity of mill-ponds and mar&s;hes, as well be con&s;idered contagious, &s;ince few, I apprehend, could be found among &s;uch patients, but that had &s;ome time or other, and generally within two or three weeks, been near them that had that complaint, or to &s;omething that might have imbibed &s;ome effluvia from them? It may be &s;aid, that although there are but <HI>few</HI> ca&s;es, &s;till there are <HI>&s;ome</HI> who have agues and fevers that never have been within the reach of febrile effluvia from an affected per&s;on: I an&s;wer, &s;o are there of the pre&s;ent complaint; few phy&s;i|cians who have had an exten&s;ive practice in this city, can be &s;trangers to the occurrence of &s;ingle in&s;tances of it without any other ca&s;es exi&s;ting, that could be &s;u&s;pected of having communicated it to them.

this city was perfectly extingui&s;hed by the fro&s;ty nights in the 10th month. It is confined mo&s;tly to low &s;ituations, in thick &s;ettled places; otherwi&s;e our alms-hou&s;e and the &s;urrounding country would have &s;adly experienced its deleterious effects.</P>
<P>Let us examine a few ca&s;es which are &s;uppo&s;ed decidedly to have been cau&s;ed by contagion. Dr. Malachi Treat, is &s;aid to have taken the fever from a per&s;on in a ve&s;&s;el that he was on board of the day before his indi&s;po&s;ition; his complaints might as well have been a&s;&s;igned to having vi&s;ited a patient in the Alms-hou&s;e &s;eventeen days before. But I cannot con|ceive why he &s;hould be &s;ingled out as a fatal victim of the effluvia of this man's body, merely from a mo|ment's vi&s;it, while all his room-mates and continued attendants, univer&s;ally e&s;caped any inconvenience: nor do I know any rea&s;on why Dr. Treat might not have taken his complaints from the &s;ame cau&s;e as this patient did; and he was &s;ick and died &s;everal days before the arrival of any of the ve&s;&s;els, &s;uppo&s;ed to have brought the &s;eeds of the di&s;order to this city. Daniel Phoenix, the city trea&s;urer, is &s;uppo&s;ed with|out doubt, to have taken his complaints from conta|gion: the corporation, &s;ome time pa&s;t, having i&s;&s;ued into circulation, for the accommodation of the in|habitants, a great number of paper penny bills, it has been concluded that he mu&s;t have received contagion, through the medium of &s;ome bundles of the&s;e bills, which he opened, that had been brought to him, af|ter having been &s;oiled and nearly worn out, to be ex|changed, and which he opened and examined to a&s;|certain their amount &s;ome days after he had received them: the probability of tho&s;e having conveyed con|tagion, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Although it is very po&s;&s;ible, that he might have taken his complaint from the effluvia, that aro&s;e from the&s;e bills, highly loaded with putrefactive materials that they had collected from the hands through which they had circulated, rendered active by their being packed up together in great numbers and confined for a time in a clo&s;e che&s;t before they were opened, &s;till it puts them only upon a par with (and in my opinion corroborates the idea of the di&s;ea&s;es being cau&s;ed by) putrefactive effluvia in ge|neral, and is far from proving them to have conveyed contagious particles from per&s;ons laboring under &s;uch a particular di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash; (See definition of contagion, p. 28.)</NOTE> cannot be very &s;triking, when we reflect,
<PB N="23" REF="031169_0029_0feb11e61b6a14e8">
that he was one among the fir&s;t of tho&s;e that were taken. Whence then could the bills have gathered the infection to give to him? we cannot &s;uppo&s;e them to have come from the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; but even if his indi&s;po&s;ition and like circum&s;tances &s;hould have occured at a more advanced period of the epidemic, it would not to me, appear to be a very likely method of communicating contagion; for per&s;ons in that &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, which is believed to be the mo&s;t infectious, &s;eldom have much to do with handling money, or even of wearing &s;uch clothes as have pockets in them, that might po&s;&s;ibly have contained &s;ome. It may be ob&s;erved, he lived in a part of the town that &s;oon after &s;uffered much by this com|plaint.</P>
<P>Dr. William M. John&s;on's ca&s;e, is publi&s;hed in proof of the fever being communicated by conta|gion; (Daily Adverti&s;er, Vol. 2, No. 3343) but I cannot conceive whence the author derives his au|thority for a&s;&s;erting that his complaints "have actu|ally happened in con&s;equence of intercour&s;e with the &s;ick." It is true, he had previou&s;ly been in compa|ny with per&s;ons that had the di&s;ea&s;e, but he al&s;o re|&s;ided in New-York before he was &s;tationed at Belle-Vue, he con&s;equently mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the &s;ame general cau&s;e of the epidemic, as his &s;uffering neighbours were; and from inquiry, I find he had
<PB N="24" REF="031169_0030_0feb11e9167ae5e8">
not left town but a few days previous to his being taken ill.</P>
<P>Frederick Steymets, one of the Committee of Health, &s;uppo&s;ed his complaint to be the effects of contagion, received by examining &s;ome papers that had belonged to a patient that died at Belle-Vue ho&s;|pital. Is it probable, that the&s;e papers, which per|haps had not been within ten feet of the patient after his di&s;ea&s;e had put on &s;uch a &s;erious a&s;pect, &s;hould imbibe and convey the cau&s;e of his complaint three or four miles, while the effluvia ari&s;ing directly from his body, had no effect upon tho&s;e who were con&s;tantly about him, and performing the mo&s;t me|nial and loath&s;ome &s;ervices for him? This valuable citizen's activity and per&s;everance in the noble cau&s;e of humanity, often led him in the mo&s;t &s;ickly parts of the city; whence, more probably, his complaints mu&s;t have originated.</P>
<P>The <HI>"po&s;itive facts"</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on by Dr. Lind, (Di&s;ea&s;es incident to Europeans in hot climates, page 195) I con&s;ider as very exceptionable proofs of the contagious nature of this fever, for although an in|fected per&s;on came on board one of the &s;loops of war which lay in the river Gambia, two or three days be|fore the &s;ickne&s;s began in them, yet it is very likely they would have been &s;ick at the &s;ame time had he not come on board, as they had not been but eight or ten days in that river, for the &s;ame author ob&s;erves that &s;ymptoms of indi&s;po&s;ition in &s;ome in&s;tances, do not occur till twelve days after having received a taint from the land air. Robert&s;on's ca&s;e (p. 195) is by no means conclu&s;ive; the little &s;pa&s;modic &s;hock that he &s;u&s;tained, being, no doubt, an accidental occur|ance; which, had it happened at any other time, per|haps never would have been noticed; his being taken
<PB N="25" REF="031169_0031_0feb11ec1fc05778">
with a fever &s;oon after, proves nothing but that the feeling the pul&s;e of a per&s;on dying, did not prevent him from getting a like complaint from the operation of cau&s;es that had been previou&s;ly applied. Nor is what occured on board the Merlin &s;loop (page 196) more &s;atisfactory: all the conclu&s;ion that I can draw from them, is, that different cla&s;&s;es of the men, were taken earlier or later with their complaints, accord|ing as they had been more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to the noxious land air.</P>
<P>To the&s;e remarks may be added the ob&s;ervation of the experienced Dr. Hunter, (Di&s;ea&s;es of the ar|my in Jamaica) when &s;peaking of the yellow fever, that "It is a matter of &s;ome con&s;olation in the hi&s;to|ry of &s;o grievous a di&s;ea&s;e, to be able to &s;ay with cer|tainty, that it is not contagious."</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, and I &s;u&s;pect with too much truth, that were all the phy&s;icians in this city to a&s;&s;ert, that our late autumnal epidemic was not contagious, they would not be able to make the people in general be|lieve them, &s;ince &s;o many think they are well ac|quainted with decided proofs of its being &s;o. This, however, will not carry a full conviction to the minds of the more con&s;iderate and rea&s;onable part of the community, &s;ince the mo&s;t popular opinions are not always the mo&s;t ju&s;t. I &s;uppo&s;e were all the faculty in America to unite, and declare their di&s;belief in the power of the imagination to mark the <HI>foetus in utero,</HI> that they could not per&s;uade the generality of women, but that, cro&s;&s;ed appetites, un&s;atisfied cravings, and frightful &s;ights, will patch their offspring with roa&s;t pig, plumb cakes, &s;trawberries, &amp;c. or give them hare lips, &s;tain them with bloody &s;pots or &s;omething of the kind; for mo&s;t of them fancy they have facts enough within their own knowledge, fully to &s;up|port
<PB N="26" REF="031169_0032_0feb11f013054b10">
the opinion of that mo&s;t influential operation of the mind.</P>
<P>Should it be a&s;ked, whence could the general idea of this di&s;ea&s;e being contagious, have originated? I an&s;wer, perhaps from no better foundation than the popular belief in witchcraft aro&s;e, in a part of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts about one hundred years ago, as well as in different parts of Europe &s;ometime before, i. e. from the credulous fears of the people, worked up|on by the erroneous opinions and publications of in|fluential per&s;onages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutchen&s;on's E&s;&s;ay concerning Witchcraft.</NOTE>. Nineteen per&s;ons were exe|cuted in and about Salem in 1692 from this demoni|acal delu&s;ion, and no doubt, but ten times that num|ber have been &s;hamefully permitted to die of the yel|low fever in Philadelphia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Carey's Account of the Malignant Fever in Philadel|phia, 1793.</NOTE> and New-York, in con&s;e|quence of neglect from the fear of contagion, when perhaps the unhappy &s;ufferers, were as free from the power of afflicting their friends, as the New England witches were.</P>

<HEAD>The Cau&s;e of the Fever, and the mo&s;t probable method of preventing its return: likewi&s;e, the Precautions to be u&s;ed to avoid an Attack, if it &s;hould again become Epidemic.</HEAD>
<P>On the &s;ixth of Augu&s;t, 1795, I received a note from John Broome, Chairman of the Committee of Health, <Q>earne&s;tly &s;oliciting me to give them every aid in my power, by my prudent advice, &amp;c. for the accompli&s;hment of the important end of their in&s;titution.</Q> In con&s;equence of which, a few days after, I made him the following communica|tion.</P>
<P><Q>That a malignant fever exi&s;ts among us, is a me|lancholy certainty, well-known to the Committee of Health; that this fever, in it&s;elf, is of a danger|ous nature, there can be no doubt; but whether it is contagious or not, is a que&s;tion yet undetermin|ed. I have not known or heard of a &s;ingle well atte&s;ted proof, of any per&s;on taking the complaint from another that was affected with it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My <HI>advice</HI> is, that the Committee, while they continue their unremitted and benevolent exertions, in preventing the introduction of infectious di&s;ea&s;es from abroad, &s;ettle not in a fal&s;e &s;ecurity, and neg|lect the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es that may exi&s;t in the ci|ty. It is from the unguarded operations of the&s;e inwalled enemies, that I conceive we have to appre|hend the greate&s;t danger.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If I have been rightly informed, a great propor|tion of the per&s;ons, that have at this &s;ea&s;on been affected with fevers of a &s;u&s;picious nature, has been
<PB N="33" REF="031169_0039_0feb120472684c00">
confined to tho&s;e who&s;e re&s;idence or occupation has obliged them to pa&s;s a con&s;iderable part of their time between Peck-&s;lip and the New-&s;lip. If &s;o, it certainly is a matter of con&s;equence, to know, whe|ther in this part of the city, there is not &s;ome local cau&s;e that may induce &s;o fatal a malady.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That putrifying &s;ub&s;tances, after a continuation of very warm weather, will give ri&s;e to &s;uch com|plaints; the fatal operation of the dock mud de|po&s;ited at Peck-&s;lip in 1791, the putrid coffee in Philadelphia in 1793, and the noxious exhalations from the creek in New-Haven in 1794, &s;ufficiently prove, without the aid of many other equally cer|tain, though more remote facts, that might be ad|duced in its &s;upport if nece&s;&s;ary.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the&s;e principles I have been led to &s;earch into this part of the town, for the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent complaint, and I believe my inquiries have not been in vain: I &s;u&s;pect that I have di&s;covered a fruitful matrix generating the &s;eeds of this complaint, and which if not properly cared for, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;pread mortality in its vicinity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A few years ago the Corporation have had Wa|ter-&s;treet, between the two beforementioned &s;lips, filled up, without obliging the proprietors of the property on the north &s;ide of the &s;treet and in Cherry-&s;treet, to fill up their yards even to a level with it. Hence, the refu&s;e water and offal &s;ub|&s;tances, from the families occupying the&s;e places, are left to &s;tagnate and putrify; and what renders it particularly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, is, that the healthful &s;how|ers, that in general wa&s;h away all &s;uch matters from other places, here only tend to render them more active; for by the water not runing off, it di&s;&s;olves
<PB N="34" REF="031169_0040_0feb1206192b8ec8">
and prepares them, thus pent up, for entering into their pe&s;tilential fermentation. Our regular and heavy rains, perhaps have been one great remote cau&s;e of the frequency of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;ea&s;es, in this neighborhood at this &s;ea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It may be worthy of remark, that many of the&s;e tenements contain &s;everal families; hence an addi|tional cau&s;e for putrefactive materials.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I make no apology for giving the&s;e hints to the Committee; the impre&s;&s;ion of their importance on my mind, rendering it a duty: the hurry of an ear|ly communication, amid&s;t frequent profe&s;&s;ional in|teruptions, mu&s;t an&s;wer for their incorrectne&s;s.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>The cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e as above &s;ugge&s;ted, not be|ing removed, its effects, in full &s;upport of my appre|hen&s;ions, truly <Q>&s;pread great mortality in the vici|nity,</Q> as is &s;een by its hi&s;tory in the foregoing ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P>This early idea of the origin of the epidemic, con|&s;tantly gained confirmation from the manner in which it increa&s;ed: it appeared to be almo&s;t entirely confined to the level &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of the town, and there it was the mo&s;t general and fatal, in the particular &s;ituations that mo&s;tly abounded with the&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="031169_0041_0feb120928104d48">
pools of putrefactive exhalations. Thus it fir&s;t be|came the mo&s;t general in and about the lower end of Dover-&s;treet: this is what might rea&s;onably be looked for when we con&s;ider that be&s;ides all the lots fronting this &s;treet being &s;unk beneath the common level of it, there are al&s;o on the docks at its lower end &s;everal &s;tore-hou&s;es and granaries, built partly over the water on piles, without having the &s;pace under them filled up; the foundation of &s;ome of them, on the &s;ides fronting the water are partitioned up &s;o as to prevent the free circulation of the tide from wa&s;hing away any thing from under them; however, the&s;e partitions were not &s;o tight but that they let in water &s;ufficient to favor the fermentation of the putrefactive materials that &s;uch a common receptacle will always collect, not only from exterior &s;ources, but al&s;o from the &s;howers of grain that frequently would pour down through holes that the rats &s;ometimes would gnaw in the floor. Hence there can be no wonder, that the &s;eeds of this di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould ripen in &s;uch a hot bed of putrefaction, aided by the effluvia emited from the great flats of mud in the &s;everal &s;urrounding impaired docks, left bare during the rece&s;s of every tide. It is remarkable that &s;everal per&s;ons employed in a large grain &s;tore-hou&s;e, thus &s;ituated over &s;uch a &s;ource of noxious mia&s;mata, were among the fir&s;t victims of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e &s;oon increa&s;ed; numbers were taken in every part of that quarter of the town, lying be|tween the upper part of Water, Pearl and Chatham-&s;treets, and acro&s;s to the lower part of George-&s;treet. From an attention to the &s;ubject not only during the hurry of the epidemic, but al&s;o &s;ince its extinction, I am led to believe according to my be&s;t judg|ment, that four fifths of all the lots in this af|fected part of the city, were &s;ituated below the level
<PB N="36" REF="031169_0042_0feb120c225181d8">
of the &s;treets they fronted, whence from our regular rains, they very generally became &s;tagnant, putrid mud puddles. I can hardly think it po&s;&s;ible, was it not for the ob&s;truction of the hou&s;es preventing a free ob&s;ervation of the&s;e grounds, that any candid per&s;on acquainted with the common cau&s;es of fevers, could harbor the lea&s;t doubt after walking through this part of the town, but that the epidemic originated from this &s;ource, rendered active by the con|tinued exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;un during the la&s;t &s;um|mer. It raged with peculiar violence in the parts that were near the docks; this is what might be expected from the additional vapor of the dock mud as above-mentioned. It al&s;o was very fa|tal in a part of George-&s;treet, <Q>not le&s;s than &s;ixty per&s;ons were buried out of it within the &s;mall com|pa&s;s of twenty hou&s;es.</Q> This was probably owing to the poi&s;onous &s;teams di&s;charged from large quan|tities of &s;treet dirt and manure, collected during the &s;ummer and depo&s;ited near the head of it, &s;ubjoined to the common cau&s;es above-mentioned. Its fatality to the We&s;t of Peck-&s;lip was induced, no doubt, by the noxious vapors from the putrid &s;ink there. The rea&s;on of its prevalence about the Fly-market, can &s;eem no ways &s;trange to any one acquainted with the &s;ituation of that place, the market being built over an offen&s;ive &s;ewer, who&s;e exhalations were confined only by an imperfect board floor, to which may be added, the effluvia con&s;tantly ari&s;ing from the putre|fying animal and vegetable matter all around, as well as from the &s;lip that puts in at it. Skinner-&s;treet is lowly &s;ituated, unpaved and very imperfectly drain|ed.</P>
<P>That putrefactive effluvia will give ri&s;e to, and are the common cau&s;e of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, is clearly proved by the accurate ob&s;ervations of the mo&s;t judicious wri|ters
<PB N="37" REF="031169_0043_0feb120ef05c1c98">
on the di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates. Lind's valuable book of intere&s;ting facts (E&s;&s;ay on the Di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates) abounds with proofs of this di&s;ea&s;e be|ing cau&s;ed by the air from the low lands in the We&s;t Indies; he particularly mentions, that it often raged in the Greenwich Ho&s;pital at Jamaica; which, as he ob&s;erves, was unfortunately built near a mar&s;h, and that it could not proceed from any &s;ource of infec|tion in the ho&s;pital. Dr. Hunter &s;ays (Di&s;ea&s;es of the army in Jamaica) &s;hips lying at Port Royal in Jamaica, on moving and taking their &s;tation higher up the harbor, have in a few days become &s;ickly. <Q>The men, &s;ays he, have been &s;eized with fevers owing to the low &s;wampy lands along &s;hore, and at the head of the harbor, from which la&s;t the ex|halations are carried every morning towards the &s;hips, when the regular &s;ea breeze &s;ets in, as is perceived by the bad &s;mell which accompanies it.</Q> He &s;ays that there are examples, where out of &s;ixty or &s;eventy men, employed in filling the water ca&s;ks, not one has e&s;caped a fever, from the watering place being wet and &s;wampy. The &s;ame author ob&s;erves, that Fort Augu&s;ta, which was at other times a &s;alubri|ous &s;ituation, became &s;ickly in 1783, the &s;ea that year having ri&s;en higher than u&s;ual, &s;o that it <Q>overflowed the whole of the ground on which the fort &s;tands, near a foot above the &s;urface in &s;ome places, and on ebbing left much &s;lime and ouze. A few days after this, many of the men were taken with fevers.</Q> Dr. Jack&s;on (Treati&s;e on the Di&s;|ea&s;es of Jamaica) as well as a ho&s;t of other authors, might be brought if nece&s;&s;ary, to prove that putrid exhalations are the common cau&s;es of epidemics. The above facts, together with the many others ad|duced by Dr. Ru&s;h (Account of the Yellow Fever &amp;c.) in their &s;upport, appear to me to be &s;ufficient
<PB N="38" REF="031169_0044_0feb1212eab768d8">
to e&s;tabli&s;h that opinion with every unprejudiced per|&s;on&mdash;which if allowed, no one acquainted with the &s;ituation of the part of this city where the yellow fever raged as above &s;tated, can have the lea&s;t doubt but that it was owing to like cau&s;es, without the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of ran&s;acking We&s;t India ve&s;&s;els or innocent bags of cotton, for that which is within our&s;elves, and who&s;e very e&s;&s;ence perhaps, is &s;uch as proves it not to be of a tran&s;portable nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been ob&s;erved by Dr. Ru&s;h, in Vol. I. of his Med. Ob|&s;ervations, as well as by Dr. Lind, that mu&s;quetoes generally attend a &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on&mdash;the &s;ame was ob&s;erved here during the la&s;t &s;ummer: the cau&s;e is very clear, for circum&s;tances favoring the ri&s;e of putrid mia&s;mata, equally favor the generation of the&s;e in|&s;ects.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Many of the &s;trenuous &s;upporters of the conta|gious nature of this di&s;ea&s;e, compelled by the force of the foregoing circum&s;tances, acknowledge, that the di&s;ea&s;e may be cau&s;ed by other means, however they cannot <HI>entirely,</HI> give up this favorite opinion, but per&s;i&s;t in a&s;&s;erting that contagion often does in|duce the di&s;ea&s;e, when the foregoing &s;tate of the air favors its operations; and they defy any one to prove that it does not. To prove a negative is al|ways difficult, &s;uch a one, perhaps impo&s;&s;ible. But &s;ince the only proof we can have of the exi&s;tence of a cau&s;e, is the nece&s;&s;ity of it for producing known effects, and &s;ince we are to admit, (according to Newton's fir&s;t philo&s;ophic precept) no more cau&s;es than are &s;ufficient to explain the appearances, and, as has been ob&s;erved, (Pemberton's view of Newton's philo&s;ophy) <Q>When one cau&s;e is &s;ufficient, if there really &s;hould in nature, be two, which is in the la&s;t degree improbable, we can have no po&s;&s;ible means of knowing it, and con&s;equently ought not to take the liberty of imagining, that there are
<PB N="39" REF="031169_0045_0feb1214cbd2ee88">
more than one.</Q> Now, therefore, as the above &s;ugge&s;ted cau&s;e of our epidemic &s;eems fully &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to produce it, nothing can be more unphilo|&s;ophic or imprudent than to &s;uppo&s;e, that contagion ever had any thing to do with it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t probable means of preventing a like ca|lamity in future will be&mdash;1&s;t, To have all the lots, particularly in the low parts of the town, filled up, &s;o as to afford a &s;ufficient de&s;cent to carry off the water into the &s;treets, and not permit any of it to &s;tagnate in them. 2d, To have the dirt and filth in the &s;treets and yards more carefully and frequently cleared away. 3d, To have the docks repaired and regu|lated in &s;uch a manner, as not to permit the mud to gather and be expo&s;ed to the &s;un at the ebb of the tide. 4th, To have the &s;paces under the granaries and &s;tore-hou&s;es on the docks, properly filled up or walled in. 5th, To prevent great quantities of &s;treet-dirt and ma|nure from being collected in heaps, and left for any time on the vacant lots, in and about the city. 6th, To have the &s;treets properly paved with a &s;ufficient de|&s;cent to prevent any water from &s;tanding in them; and 7th, To have the common &s;ewers, in good or|der and well covered. An attention to the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, no doubt, will prevent the return of a like epidemic in this city; for, as I &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome time &s;ince to the corporation, <Q>whether the di&s;ea&s;e is contagious, or whether it was imported or not; this one fact &s;eems to be pretty firmly e&s;tab|li&s;hed, that it never has <HI>&s;pread,</HI> but by the influence of putrefactive effluvia.</Q></P>
<P>If, either from a neglect of the foregoing precau|tions or from any other cau&s;es, the yellow fever &s;hould again become prevalent in any part of this
<PB N="40" REF="031169_0046_0feb1217f919e798">
city, it certainly would be mo&s;t prudent for &s;uch as have it in their power, to remove from it; or if unavoidable circum&s;tances, or the calls of humanity &s;hould render it nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome to continue there for a part of the time, let them if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hun the night air, as the harbinger of death, and e&s;pecially to avoid &s;leeping in that neighborhood, as they value their lives; for perhaps in the relaxed hours of re&s;t, the epidemic mia&s;mata may act with redoubled force. Dr. Lind's in&s;tances clearly &s;hews the particular dan|ger of &s;leeping within the limits of the contaminated air; many per&s;ons having been taken with the com|plaint, after having &s;lept a night on &s;hore in the low ground, while others, who had pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable time there during the day, and always returned to the ve&s;&s;els at night, generally e&s;caped it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, keeping from the night air of the epide|mic neighborhood, and the &s;leeping in a healthy part of the town: all per&s;ons who are forced to pa&s;s &s;ome of their time in the contaminated atmo&s;phere, &s;hould avoid with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention, exce&s;&s;es of every kind; not only of eating and drinking, but al&s;o of heat, exerci&s;e and watching. But I wi&s;h to be under&s;tood, not to mean a rigid ab&s;tinence from, or a re&s;triction with re&s;pect to the&s;e things; but only to advi&s;e moderation and regularity in the u&s;e of them, becau&s;e it is likely that a very low diet and the entire neglect of wine, with them who have been ac|cu&s;tomed to it, as well as cold, inactivity, too much &s;leep, fear, &amp;c. may as effectually predi&s;po&s;e to this complaint, as their oppo&s;ite extremes: I believe the more regularly we &s;upport the natural healthy tone of our bodies, the more powerful they will re&s;i&s;t the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es applied to them.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="031169_0047_0feb121aca3c6838">The ob&s;ervation of Dr. Lining mu&s;t be a great &s;a|tisfaction to tho&s;e who have once &s;uffered with this di&s;ea&s;e.

In the We&s;t-India I&s;l|lands an attack of this di&s;ea&s;e, which &s;eems almo&s;t entirely confined to per&s;ons from more northern cli|mates, is called a <HI>&s;ea&s;oning,</HI> and after which, if the patient recovers, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be pretty &s;ecure. I never have known of any per&s;on having had it twice decidedly; perhaps &s;ome in&s;tances &s;uppo&s;ed to have been that fever, were only common remittents. Dr. Ru&s;h &s;ays, (Medical Ob&s;ervations, Vol. 2.) that <Q>during the prevalence of the meazles, he as well as Dr. Quier, ob&s;erved &s;everal per&s;ons (who had had that di&s;ea&s;e, and who were clo&s;ely confined to the rooms of per&s;ons ill with it) to be affected with a &s;light cough, &s;ore throat, and even &s;ores in the mouth.</Q> And what are called nur&s;e pocks, are no rare things with per&s;ons (who have previou&s;ly had the &s;mall pox) that have much to do with pati|ents in that di&s;ea&s;e: &s;o al&s;o is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome people may &s;uffer a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition from the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, after having had it once, which per|haps ought not to be con&s;idered as a full attack of it. It may be that the great debility, remaining after a complete removal of this di&s;ea&s;e, may predi&s;po&s;e to an attack of &s;ome other, perhaps of a fever of a dif|ferent nature, that might even prove fatal, &s;o like con|&s;equences might follow a &s;evere attack of the &s;mall pox and no one would con&s;ider this as a return of the di&s;ea&s;e.

<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>In the treatment of this, as of all other di&s;ea&s;es, the fir&s;t object &s;hould be to remove their cau&s;e; for although in &s;ome in&s;tances, the human body by habit may be enabled to re&s;i&s;t the effects of injurious im|pre&s;&s;ions, and even by proper means to recover it&s;elf after morbid effects are inducted, while the cau&s;e &s;till continues; yet that phy&s;ician would be con&s;idered very deficient, who would undertake to cure an <HI>oph|thalmia</HI> cau&s;ed by re&s;iding in a &s;moky apartment, or the <HI>cholera infantum,</HI> originating from the impurity and heat of the city air, without fir&s;t advi&s;ing his pa|tients to remove from &s;uch an obnoxious &s;ituation, for although he might &s;ometimes &s;ucceed in his at|tempts, yet it certainly would be attended with more difficulty and uncertainty; &s;o al&s;o is it in the yellow fever; hence in this di&s;ea&s;e it is of the highe&s;t impor|tance to have the patient removed, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, out of the reach of the original cau&s;e of his com|plaints, into a more &s;alubrious atmo&s;phere; a neglect of this perhaps was one main rea&s;on of the great fatality of this epidemic; therefore, &s;hould it again prevail, it would be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, for tho&s;e who&s;e circum&s;tances would admit of it, to &s;e|cure a proper a&s;ylum in ca&s;e of an attack, and the poor ought to be indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought after and ear|ne&s;tly advi&s;ed, early in their complaints, to remove to &s;uch places as the police may prepare for their re|ception.

<P>Whether the original cau&s;e be removed or not, the next indications are,</P>

To fulfil the fir&s;t indication, a &s;ufficient do&s;e, viz. ten or twelve grains of calomel, with as much jalap or rheubarb, &s;hould be exhibited immediately and repeated every &s;ix or eight hours, till it purges freely; its operations &s;hould be favored by the plentiful drinking of warm chicken or barley water or gruel, and keeping warm in bed; by the&s;e means oftentimes a free per&s;piration is brought on, and the &s;econd indication is accompli&s;hed at the &s;ame time; an almo&s;t complete remi&s;&s;ion being the con|&s;iquence.</P>
<P>Let no one fear the largene&s;s of the do&s;e of the purgative, or its early repetition as above recom|mended, for in no di&s;ea&s;e perhaps is it of more con|&s;equence to obtain the &s;peedy operation of medicine
<PB N="44" REF="031169_0050_0feb12233637c6a8">
than in this; it is probable many lives have been lo&s;t from the cautious timidity of Phy&s;icians, in giv|ing but &s;mall and repeated do&s;es of cathartics, till the di&s;ea&s;e &s;tole on to that &s;tage wherein the great irritability of the &s;tomach utterly refu&s;ed to retain any more of it, before they have given a &s;ufficiency effectually to evacuate the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>If a remi&s;&s;ion does not &s;ucceed to the operation of this medicine, but &s;ymptoms of great excitement, with violent pain in the head, &amp;c. particularly in per&s;ons of a full habit of body, with a plenitude in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, bleeding undoubtedly promi&s;ed and proved of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, and ought by no means to be neglected; but I do not wi&s;h to be under&s;tood to recommend the indi&s;criminate u&s;e of the lancet by any means, for there are innumera|ble circum&s;tances, both as they relate to the previous &s;tate of the patient, as well as to the exi&s;ting &s;ymp|toms, that &s;hould always govern the judicious phy|&s;ician in the u&s;e of this mo&s;t powerful remedy.</P>
<P>After the operation of the purgative, if the degree of excitement or tone in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould not ju&s;tify the loo&s;ing of blood, or if as much has been drawn as the &s;tate of the patient may render advi&s;eable, and &s;till there remain a degree of ten&s;ion in the pul&s;e, a dryne&s;s on the &s;urface, &amp;c. a &s;udorific draught of half an ounce of <HI>&s;pt. minderer</HI> with twen|ty drops of <HI>tinct. thebaic</HI> has often been exhibited with the happie&s;t effects; a &s;weat generally &s;ucceed|ing with a con&s;iderable remi&s;&s;ion of all the &s;ymptoms; in conjunction with the &s;udorific portion, the patient &s;hould have his feet and legs fomented with flannels wrung out of warm water, for as long as half an hour at lea&s;t; he &s;hould al&s;o favor its operation by a plen|tiful dilution with the beforementioned drinks.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="031169_0051_0feb12260338ebb0">The u&s;e of antimonial medicines have been greatly recommended in this &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, to bring on a remi&s;&s;ion; but I confe&s;s, in the few in&s;tances where|in I made trial of them, they did not an&s;wer my ex|pectations, the &s;tate of the &s;tomach generally being &s;uch as would not bear even the &s;malle&s;t do&s;es of them.</P>
<P>For the violent pain in the head attending this fir&s;t &s;tage, nothing &s;eemed more effectual than the con|&s;tant application of linen cloths, wetted with cold vinegar and water to the forehead and temples, and changed as &s;oon as they became warm.</P>
<P>I know not whether Dr. Jack&s;on's method of u&s;ing the <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>cold bath</HI> alternately, has been practi&s;ed by any phy&s;icians of this city; but the da&s;h|ing of <HI>cold water</HI> over the body, and afterwards drink|ing plentifully of a &s;trong infu&s;ion of <HI>rad. &s;erpentar.</HI> has been much cried up by &s;ome; I u&s;ed it in but a &s;ingle ca&s;e, and although the patient was particularly attended to, yet the looked for &s;weat and remi&s;&s;ion did not &s;ucceed; this was neverthele&s;s, accompli&s;hed afterwards by the partial application of cold vinegar and water to his forehead.</P>
<P>After the bowels were properly evacuated and a remi&s;&s;ion obtained, I lo&s;t not a moment's time, but immediately applied to the u&s;e of the <HI>bark,</HI> in do&s;es apportioned to the &s;tate of the &s;tomach, half a drachm, if it would retain &s;o much, was given every two hours, otherwi&s;e half that quantity was given and increa&s;ed as the &s;tomach would bear it; it was exhi|bited in milk and water or &s;ome of the drinks before|mentioned, which ever was mo&s;t agreeable; a few drops of the acid <HI>elix. vitriol</HI> with each do&s;e of the bark, &s;ometimes would make it more agreeable to
<PB N="46" REF="031169_0052_0feb1228d1a03500">
the &s;tomach; it &s;eems hardly nece&s;&s;ary to mention that in this ca&s;e it mu&s;t not be given in milk. When the bark in &s;ub&s;tance could not be retained, the cold infu&s;ion was &s;ub&s;tituted in do&s;es from half an ounce to an ounce, according to circum&s;tances, and repeated every two hours or oftener if it &s;at well on the &s;tomach. At the exacerbations of the fever, the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies was often &s;u&s;pended, and the means beforementioned were applied to, till a degree of remi&s;&s;ion was again obtained, when the u&s;e of the bark, &amp;c. was again re&s;umed. When the patient was co&s;tive, he had a few grains of rheubarb united with each do&s;e of his bark, till that &s;tate was obviated.</P>
<P>The acid <HI>elix. vitr.</HI> was u&s;ed with advantage during the remi&s;&s;ion of this di&s;ea&s;e, particularly if hemorrhages attended it. I have already mentioned it, as u&s;eful in making the bark &s;it ea&s;y on the &s;to|mach; but in ca&s;e the bark &s;hould be retained well without it, it then would perhaps be better to admi|ni&s;ter it between the times of taking that medicine; it may be that this acid, while it covers the bitter ta&s;te, may likewi&s;e tend to le&s;&s;en the tonic effects the bark</P>
<P>Generally, if the abovementioned means were not u&s;ed, and frequently notwith&s;tanding our greate&s;t at|tention, about the third or fourth day, the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e would be u&s;hered in with pain and con&s;tant &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach, particularly upon &s;wallowing any thing; an epi&s;pa&s;tic was often ap|plied to the &s;crobiculis cordis in this &s;ituation, and &s;ometimes with advantage; &s;ome others received be|nefit from u&s;ing warm fomentations to the part. Laudanum was rejected; but in &s;ome in&s;tances I thought a grain of &s;olid opium was admini&s;tered
<PB N="51" REF="031169_0053_0feb122b9e2d6ef0" MS="y">
with good effects, and &s;mall bleedings &s;eemed &s;ome|times u&s;eful; this, however, as well as all other means, often failed, the &s;tomach throwing up every thing that was taken into it. In this de&s;perate &s;tate, our la&s;t refuge was to the bowels, and our only de|pendence appeared to be upon the plentiful exhibi|tion of our remedies <HI>per anum,</HI> half an ounce of pow|dered bark, with a gill of milk, chicken &s;oup or beef tea, and twenty-five or thirty drops of lauda|num, make a proper injection for this purpo&s;e; it &s;hould be repeated at lea&s;t twice a day. This means no doubt has pre&s;erved the lives of many; &s;hould the bark be retained in the bowels till the period of ad|mini&s;tering the third do&s;e, it would be advi&s;eable to bring it away by a common injection of warm water, before that is given.</P>
<P>From ob&s;erving that none died who were affected with a &s;alivation, I attempted in &s;everal in&s;tances to induce that affection, by rubbing the gums with calo|mel and u&s;ing mercurial frictions; but as the&s;e at|tempts were made only in the latter &s;tages of de&s;|perate ca&s;es, I never &s;ucceeded. May not mercurial frictions be advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed from the commence|ment of the di&s;ea&s;e to produce this affection?</P>
<P>The diet of the patient in this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould be of the milde&s;t nature; panado, chicken &s;oup, beef tea, roa&s;t apples and milk, tapioca, &amp;c. appeared to agree be&s;t with the delicate &s;ituation of the &s;tomach, and perhaps were the mo&s;t proper food that could be taken.</P>
<P>In the convale&s;cence, a continuance of the bark and elixir of vitriol, a more nouri&s;hing diet of roa&s;t|ed oy&s;ters, beef-&s;teakes, porter, &amp;c. together with

moderate exerci&s;e in the country air, were the mo&s;t effectual means of re&s;toring the lo&s;t tone to the de|bilitated &s;y&s;tems of tho&s;e who happily &s;urvived the effects of this mo&s;t dreadful di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE FEBRILE DISORDERS WHICH PREVAILED IN SHEFFIELD, IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, IN THE YEARS 1793, 1794 AND 1795. EXTRACTED FROM A LETTER OF WILLIAM BUEL, PHYSICIAN AT SHEFFIELD, TO E. H. SMITH, PHYSICIAN, OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE entering directly on the &s;ubject of the di&s;orders, which prevailed here in 1793, 1794 and 1795, I &s;hall mention &s;ome circum&s;tances relative to the face of the country in the Town of Sheffield.</P>
<P>The river Hou&s;atonak runs in a &s;erpentine cour&s;e through this town, from North to South. Upon the banks of the river, on each &s;ide, is an extent of intervale, or meadow land, averaging on both &s;ides at about a mile in breadth. The greate&s;t part of this intervale is overflowed at the time of the thawing away of the &s;now, in the &s;pring; and &s;ometimes, by large and &s;udden fre&s;hets, at other &s;ea&s;ons. The na|ture of the &s;oil, in general, is &s;uch, that, very &s;oon after the water is off, the land is dry and fit for tillage. It is, however, much inter&s;per&s;ed with coves and mar&s;hes; in the former of which the water re|mains &s;tagnant a con&s;iderable part of the &s;ummer, and in many of them perpetually; of the latter there are not many upon this river, but there are &s;ome which remain &s;uch through the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB REF="031169_0057_0feb1232c461bc10" MS="y">Be&s;ide the Hou&s;atonak, there are two other con&s;i|derable &s;treams, running through part of this town, which unite and empty into that river. Upon each of the&s;e &s;treams are large tracts of low, mar&s;hy lands; great part of which is overflowed by fre&s;hets, and is never perfectly dry.&mdash;There is (which is very mate|rial) a mill-dam, on each of the&s;e &s;treams; and the two dams occa&s;ion the overflowing of &s;everal hund|red acres of the low lands. As &s;ummer advances, and the ponds fall, con&s;iderable parts of the&s;e lands are left uncovered by the water; more or le&s;s, ac|cording to the drought of the &s;ummer. In both of the&s;e ponds are large quantities of timber and other vegetable matters, which, in hot weather, are al|ways in a &s;tate of putrefaction. This &s;tate exi&s;ts in an increa&s;ed degree as the &s;ub&s;tances become more expo&s;ed to the action of the &s;un. The foetor occa|&s;ioned by this putrifying ma&s;s is &s;uch, in hot weather and when the water is low, as to be extremely offen|&s;ive to the &s;mell, at the di&s;tance of many rods.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this town, who live in the vi|cinity of the&s;e mar&s;hy and drowned lands, have, as would naturally be expected, been always &s;ubject to remittent and intermittent fevers, from its fir&s;t &s;et|tlement. It is, however, generally remarked by the old people, that the&s;e di&s;orders have of late years&mdash; until the three la&s;t&mdash;decrea&s;ed: owing, probably, to the clearing, or partial draining, of the lands.</P>
<P>Although the di&s;orders which have prevailed in this town, for two or three years pa&s;t, are owing un|doubtedly, principally to the&s;e local cau&s;es; yet it is not improbable that &s;ome predi&s;po&s;ition to them was occa&s;ioned by a general con&s;titution of the air. To a&s;certain this point, with any degree of preci&s;ion, we ought to have before us an accurate hi&s;tory of the
<PB N="53" REF="031169_0058_0feb123777aff758">
weather, for &s;everal years pa&s;t. Even then it would, perhaps, be impo&s;&s;ible; as it has ever been found a difficult matter to trace any connection between the manife&s;t qualities of the air, and the effects of a ge|neral con&s;titution of it, favorable to di&s;ea&s;e. As I am unable, either from minutes, or memory, to give any account of the weather, I &s;hall leave the mat|ter unattempted.</P>
<P>In the year 1793, during the &s;ea&s;on in which &s;uch complaints u&s;ually appear, intermittents and their concomitants were more frequent than they had been for many years before. In September and October, there were a few &s;cattering in&s;tances of bilious fevers.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring of 1794, inflammatory com|plaints, chiefly of the pneumonic kind, were unu&s;u|ally prevalent. They were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by inter|mittents; which were more frequent than they had been the year before. Nothing peculiar attended them; and they continued to occur pretty often through the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Towards the la&s;t of July, the bilious, or, as it is called here, the pond-fever, began to make its ap|pearance; principally about the South Pond, one of the mill-ponds beforementioned, and near the Canaan line. There were &s;ome &s;cattered in&s;tances about the North Pond: and a few, which were at &s;uch a di&s;|tance from both, that they were, probably, occa&s;ioned by the &s;tagnant water about the great river, the Hou&s;atonak. But the di&s;order was chiefly confined to the vicinity of the South Pond. The influence of this pond appeared to extend about one mile and a half from its borders. Within this place there are about 150 inhabitants; and about 80 of this number
<PB REF="031169_0059_0feb123a6f314898" MS="y">
were affected with the fever: part of them inhabit|ants of Sheffield, and a part of Canaan. Among tho&s;e who were &s;ick, there were five or &s;ix in&s;tances of mortality. There were not more than ten or twelve per&s;ons who had the di&s;order in other parts of this town. From the&s;e there was but one death; and that in a ca&s;e complicated with pregnancy, and eventually with phthi&s;is pulmonalis. People con|tinued to be attacked with this fever through the months of Augu&s;t, September and a part of October.</P>
<P>The di&s;order was, probably, in all re&s;pects, what is termed a bilious remitting fever. It began with an ague fit; inten&s;e pains in the back, head and limbs, &s;oon &s;ucceeded by thir&s;t, dryne&s;s of the &s;kin, &amp;c. continuing without much variation 18 or 20 hours: a &s;light moi&s;ture then broke out upon the &s;kin&mdash;&s;eldom a profu&s;e &s;weat; a degree of remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, and abatement of the pains, then en&s;ued, and continued till about the time of day of the fir&s;t attack, when another exacerbation of fever com|menced, with &s;ymptoms &s;imilar to the fir&s;t. If the di&s;ea&s;e was left to it&s;elf, the remi&s;&s;ions would &s;ome|times become &s;horter and more imperfect, as the pa|roxy&s;ms were repeated, until it grew to be nearly or quite a continued fever. A diarrhea, and &s;ometimes dy&s;enteric &s;ymptoms were added to the re&s;t. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who died were attended with a preternaturally lax &s;tate of the bowels; which, in &s;everal in&s;tances, might properly be called dy&s;enteric. The tongue was, from the fir&s;t, covered with a white fur. After three or four days, a black &s;tripe began to appear; extending from the root, towards the extremity; and gradually &s;preading, as the di&s;order advanced, till the whole tongue a&s;&s;umed a black appearance. Even the teeth and gums were &s;ometimes covered by this black fur; and in &s;ome patients who afterwards re|covered.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="031169_0060_0feb123d40a33158">In the treatment of this di&s;order, evacuation of &s;ome kind, is undoubtedly nece&s;&s;ary in the early &s;tage of it. Vene&s;ection generally produced a temporary relief from the violence of the pain, and was, proba|bly, when the con&s;titution was firm and robu&s;t, and the habit plethoric, frequently u&s;eful; but it did not appear to me to be important as a curative remedy. Emetics &s;ometimes did well; and where there was a great degree of nau&s;ea, I thought them u&s;eful. But purging, with calomel and jalap, was the mode of evacuation I preferred, and generally practi&s;ed; and the remedy which of all others appeared to me mo&s;t advantageous in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay any thing more, in this place, than that a&s;&s;iduous purging, in the begin|ning, and a plentiful u&s;e of the Bark, after the remi&s;|&s;ions had become &s;uch as to make it admi&s;&s;ible, were the e&s;&s;ential parts of the management of this di&s;order.</P>
<P>So &s;trong was the tendency to di&s;orders of this kind, that people continued in &s;ome in&s;tances to be affected with intermittents, or fever and ague, thro' the winter. The&s;e were very frequent in the &s;pring, but with no peculiarities, and yielding to the common remedy with the u&s;ual facility.</P>
<P>During the month of Augu&s;t 1795, I was in the county of Ontario, in the we&s;tern part of the &s;tate of New-York. There was, at that time, a di&s;order prevalent there, of the &s;ame nature with that which I found rife in Sheffield, on my return, and which I am about to de&s;cribe. It was chiefly exi&s;tent in the neighborhood of &s;tagnant waters, and in &s;ituations &s;imilar to tho&s;e places, in this town, to which the di&s;|ea&s;e was mo&s;tly confined. The treatment required was, of cour&s;e, the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="031169_0061_0feb1241326f0e78">On my return to Sheffield, which was the 5th of September, I found a number of the inhabitants, about the North Pond, afflicted with a fever, which began to appear about three weeks before. The people fir&s;t attacked were tho&s;e who lived neare&s;t to the pond; whole families of whom were down at once. Numbers continued to be taken, daily, chiefly within the vicinity of this Pond, or within three quar|ters of a mile of its borders, till about the middle of October; after which time there were few in&s;tances of new attacks. In this time, i. e. from the 10th of Augu&s;t to the 20th of October, of about 200 (which is not far from the number of per&s;ons living within three quarters of a mile of &s;ome of the borders of this pond) not le&s;s than 150 were affected with more or le&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e; out of which number, but one per&s;on died, and that an aged man, previou&s;ly debili|tated and di&s;ordered.&mdash;The number affected with this fever, in all other parts of this town, did not, I believe, exceed thirty. Of the&s;e, three died: one, an aged woman: the other two, pregnant women; of whom, one died in the fever, the other &s;uffered an abortion, and died &s;ome months after, drop&s;ical.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e, this year, put on a different form to what it did the la&s;t. It might, with more propriety be called an intermittent, than a remittent fever; though it was very different from a common fever and ague. It began, like other fevers, with an ague fit, attended with pains in the head, back and limbs. The duration of this part of the paroxy&s;m was uncer|tain. It was &s;ucceeded by a hot fit, who&s;e duration was, in different per&s;ons, from &s;ix to forty-eight hours. A remi&s;&s;ion, and, &s;ometimes, nearly or quite, a perfect intermi&s;&s;ion, then came on; but who&s;e du|ration was as irregular and uncertain as was that of the paroxy&s;m before. After the fir&s;t, the paroxy&s;ms
<PB REF="031169_0062_0feb1242dbafe7e8">
were not generally u&s;hered in by a regular ague fit; only &s;ome &s;light chills were felt; and the&s;e were ir|regular, both in degree and continuance. The length of the next &s;ucceeding paroxy&s;ms and intervals could, by no means, be calculated for, from the preceding: &s;o completely irregular was this di&s;order. The fever evidently tended to an intermittent form; but it could neither be called quotidian, tertian, quartan, nor by any other name u&s;ed by authors to di&s;tingui&s;h the different &s;pecies of intermitting fevers. The pains in the head, limbs and back, were very &s;evere, parti|cularly in the latter, which were &s;o univer&s;ally in|ten&s;e, that the &s;ymptom might almo&s;t be con&s;idered as charactere&s;tic of the di&s;order. In the primae viae, flatulency was nearly a con&s;tantly-attendant and very trouble&s;ome &s;ymptom. Evidences of an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion and excretion of bile, were generally pre|&s;ent through the di&s;ea&s;e, but were particularly ob|&s;ervable in the convale&s;cence. Some degree of yel|lowne&s;s of the &s;kin, which was almo&s;t univer&s;al, indi|cated a reab&s;orption of this fluid, and a depo&s;ition of it upon the &s;kin. This yellowne&s;s was in two in|&s;tances, which I &s;aw, very inten&s;e. A &s;light degree of delirium was very common, during the height of the fever. The appearance of the tongue was much the &s;ame that it was la&s;t year.</P>
<P>My method of treating the fever of this year, was &s;imilar to that which I employed the la&s;t year.&mdash; Purging, in the beginning, and afterwards a plentiful u&s;e of the Bark, appeared to me to be the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful way of managing it. In extreme ca&s;es, parti|cularly, a free and full exhibition of bark, wine and laudanum, &s;eemed the only means of &s;alvation. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the patient &s;hould be thoroughly purged, previous to the u&s;e of &s;timulants, otherwi&s;e the bark, wine or laudanum, would have
<PB N="58" REF="031169_0063_0feb1245f8e27c18">
very pernicious effects. I &s;aw &s;everal in&s;tances, at the we&s;tward, where, by too early a u&s;e of the&s;e me|dicines, the fever was changed into a continued form, attended with a con&s;tantly dry and yellow &s;kin, com|ato&s;e &s;ymptoms, &amp;c. One of the in&s;tances of extreme yellowne&s;s, which I have mentioned, was of this kind, and at the we&s;tward. I removed this &s;ymptom, and recovered the patient, by giving repeated do&s;es of calomel and jalap, &s;ome per&s;pirative medicines, and afterwards the bark, wine, &amp;c. Each purge, in this ca&s;e, le&s;&s;ened the degree of yellowne&s;s, very appa|rently. The other in&s;tance of inten&s;e yellowne&s;s, which I &s;aw, was in this town, in the ca&s;e of the pregnant woman, whom I have mentioned to have died in the fever. This woman's fever never had di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ions. Several &s;light attempts were made to admini&s;ter the bark; but it would not do. Perhaps my timidity in the u&s;e of evacuants, on ac|count of her &s;ituation, was injurious to her.</P>
<P>The Bark did not &s;u&s;pend the paroxy&s;ms, in this di&s;order, in as &s;hort a time as it does in common in|termittents; but, if the patient was properly pre|pared, and the u&s;e of it was per&s;evered in, it never failed to have the effect.</P>
<P>Purging was probably u&s;eful in a twofold way: Fir&s;t, by carrying off the &s;uperfluous bile; which was, evidently, &s;ecreted and excreted in a preternatu|ral quantity: Secondly, by reducing the &s;thenic dia|the&s;is, which was, perhaps, always pre&s;ent, in the early &s;tage of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>It is true, that tho&s;e who&s;e fever was &s;u&s;pended by the bark, were &s;ubject to frequent relap&s;es, and to a long and lingering &s;tate of convale&s;cence. This drew an odium upon that medicine; and many were
<PB N="59" REF="031169_0064_0feb1249f39de9b8">
induced to believe that it was owing to the u&s;e of it that people were &s;o long in recovering, and, of cour&s;e, that it was improper. I am convinced, how|ever, from very attentive ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e who did not take the bark, but &s;uffered the fever gradually to wear away, as it &s;ometimes would, were equally &s;ubject to tho&s;e inconveniences. Indeed, this &s;eems to be the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. The old people in this town, who recollect the times when di&s;orders of this kind have prevailed here before, and when the bark was not at all u&s;ed, inform me that tho&s;e who were afflicted with them, were a long time in recover|ing.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that, in all ca&s;es, when patients have got rid of the fever, either by means of the bark, or otherwi&s;e, there remains an increa&s;ed di&s;po&s;ition to the formation and excretion of bile, and that this humor accumulates in the primae viae, till it fir&s;t de|&s;troys the appetite and occa&s;ions nau&s;ea, and then excites a &s;pontaneous di&s;charge by &s;tool or vomiting, or a relap&s;e of fever, or both. A continuance in the u&s;e of &s;ome laxative medicine, after a recovery, has a tendency to prevent the&s;e effects; and, if &s;trictly at|tended to, would probably prevent them, and per|haps obviate the di&s;po&s;ition to relap&s;e entirely.</P>
<P>In reflecting on phenomena of this kind, the hu|man mind is anxious to fix on &s;omething &s;atisfactory as their cau&s;es. Specific contagion, I am convinced, was in no in&s;tance, which came under my ob&s;erva|tion, either here or at the we&s;tward, the cau&s;e of the propagation of the di&s;order. That mar&s;h effluvia, to who&s;e action the inhabitants of &s;ome parts of this town are &s;ubject, is the exciting cau&s;e, and is nece&s;|&s;ary to the production of the di&s;orders in que&s;tion, is beyond any manner of doubt. This is evident from
<PB N="60" REF="031169_0065_0feb124b9ae3e558">
their exi&s;ting only where this influence extends. But &s;omething more is wanting; otherwi&s;e we cannot account for their prevailing in &s;ome years, and not in others. Every circum&s;tance relative to the ponds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have endeavored to di&s;cover the cau&s;e why the &s;ickne&s;s in 1794, was confined almo&s;t entirely to the South, and in 1795, to the North-Pond; but I can find no local circum&s;tances to have exi&s;ted which &s;hould produce &s;ickne&s;s about one, and not about the other, in either of the&s;e years.</NOTE> and mar&s;hes in this town has, apparently, been the &s;ame, for many years pa&s;t; and yet very little of this form of di&s;ea&s;e has appeared, for ten or twelve years back, until the two la&s;t. We mu&s;t either &s;uppo&s;e a peculiar con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere, occa&s;ioning a predi&s;po&s;ition to the&s;e di&s;orders, and coinciding with the local cau&s;e, or mar&s;h effluvia; or that the mar&s;h effluvia it&s;elf is, by &s;ome peculiarity of the atmo&s;|phere, wrought up to a higher pitch of virulence, and thus produces a higher degree of di&s;ea&s;e. I am in|clined to admit the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, as I am con|vinced that the fevers which have prevailed here, for two or three years pa&s;t, and the common intermittent fever, are the &s;ame, only differing in degree. I have &s;een all degrees, from the milde&s;t form of intermit|tents, to the mo&s;t extreme of bilious remitting fever. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay where the line of divi&s;ion &s;hall be drawn. The di&s;ea&s;e this year &s;eems to have formed a connecting link between intermittent and bilious fever; and, were I to name it, I would call it a bil|ious intermittent. Should the intermittent fever, in its u&s;ual form, prevail next year, the di&s;order may be &s;aid, in the three years, to have been in regular gra|dations run through.</P>

<P>THE following letters were written at the reque&s;t, and for the information, of a medical friend, with whom the writer has long been accu&s;tomed to cor|re&s;pond, both on profe&s;&s;ional and general topics. Being compo&s;ed originally without any view to the pre&s;s, and nearly fini&s;hed before the idea of publica|tion was &s;ugge&s;ted, they will need much indulgence for many defects of expre&s;&s;ion and method, which the writer has not lei&s;ure to correct. Much, too, mu&s;t be pardoned to that pruriency of &s;tyle, and po|&s;itivene&s;s of deci&s;ion, into which per&s;ons in habits of fraternal intimacy are apt to fall, and which the laws of epi&s;tolary intercour&s;e do not forbid. A careful revi&s;ion, would, doubtle&s;s, have rendered the&s;e let|ters more acceptable, in the&s;e re&s;pects, and have cha&s;ti&s;ed them of tho&s;e repetitions of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion, which, though partially avoided in tran&s;|cribing for the pre&s;s, &s;till occur too frequently. But this was impo&s;&s;ible. A further, and more &s;atisfacto|ry, apology may be expected, for the opinions which they contain;&mdash;con&s;idering the youth, and &s;uppo&s;ed inexperience, of the writer. It is not improbable that ha&s;ty and unfounded opinions have crept into the following pages; opinions un&s;upported by fact, and which informed rea&s;on would di&s;claim. If &s;uch there are, no per&s;on can be more de&s;irous, than he who has delivered, to di&s;cover them, or more ready to relinqui&s;h them. But a conclu&s;ion again&s;t an opinion &s;hould re&s;t on &s;ome better foundation than the age of him who maintains it.

<HEAD>LETTERS ON THE FEVER OF 1795.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER FIRST.</HI> INTRODUCTORY.</HEAD>
<P>IN compliance with your wi&s;hes, and in return for the communication with which you lately favored me, relative to the di&s;ea&s;es which prevailed in the neighborhood where you re&s;ide, for the la&s;t three years, I have put together all the &s;canty information I po&s;&s;e&s;s, re&s;pecting the fever which was the occa&s;ion of &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s to this City, in the la&s;t &s;ummer and autumn.&mdash;I regret my inability to communicate a more minute and &s;pecific &s;tatement of facts; and the more, as there &s;eems little probability, at pre&s;ent, that any per&s;on, qualified for the ta&s;k, will undertake it. Various circum&s;tances con&s;pired to narrow the &s;phere of my ob&s;ervation; and this may have led me into erroneous conclu&s;ions, which more exten&s;ive practice and wider ob&s;ervation would have corrected in me, and may have corrected in others. But, how faulty &s;oever my rea&s;onings may be thought, I mu&s;t demand ab&s;olute and entire credit for my facts. In the&s;e, I cannot well have been deceived: for the very circum&s;tances which rendered them few, made me more attentive, and gave me lei&s;ure to be accu|rate. There is but one po&s;&s;ible way in which any fal&s;ity can be chargeable on them; and this might be, were I to pretend to decide that the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e was always &s;uch, as when it came beneath my notice. But you will under&s;tand me &s;trictly. I
<PB N="66" REF="031169_0070_0feb125a84107b48">
de&s;cribe what I &s;aw; and mean only <HI>then</HI> to make a remark general, <HI>when</HI> I &s;ow expre&s;s it, and when I find a concurrent opinion on the part of many. In my rea&s;onings on facts, you will not blame me for taking a range &s;omewhat wider; for, &s;hould I, in my way, light on &s;ome truth, intere&s;ting and important, it will well repay you for the fatigue of accompanying me; and, &s;hould I not, your friend&s;hip will excu&s;e me, in this in&s;tance, as it has often done before. Of one thing further you ought to be forwarned: That, con|cerning every thing connected with the fever of 1795, where opinion may be exerci&s;ed, there is va|riety of opinion. And as, in this conte&s;t of jarring and ho&s;tile opinions, but one can have ju&s;tice on its &s;ide, I would have you follow mine, with diffidence, into the field of controver&s;y. Victory does not always incline the balance on the &s;ide of right; but even &s;hould mine de&s;erve defeat, it will &s;uffer in the com|pany of myriads.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER SECOND.</HI> An account of the &s;ituation and peculiarities of that part of the City in which the Fever mo&s;t prevailed, in <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the fever continued to extend it&s;elf, to the la&s;t, yet it never became general over the city; and, for a long time, it was mo&s;tly confined to a par|ticular di&s;trict. As the &s;ea&s;on advanced, the pecu|liarities of this di&s;trict may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have be|come common to a larger portion of the city; and their exten&s;ion to the whole only prevented by the &s;etting in of winter. To the di&s;trict alluded to, the Ea&s;t river, from Long-I&s;land ferry to Mr. Rutgers's,
<PB N="67" REF="031169_0071_0feb125daa4fe8c0">
forms the ea&s;tern boundary; the northern reaches from thence to Divi&s;ion-&s;treet; thence we&s;terly, down Divi&s;ion-&s;treet, Chatham-&s;treet, the extremity of Pearl-&s;treet, into William-&s;treet, to Franckfort-&s;treet, down this la&s;t to Gold-&s;treet, through that to Beek|man-&s;treet, along which the line proceeds to Pearl-&s;treet, as far as the Market, down which it &s;hould be continued to the river.&mdash;The &s;pace included in the&s;e bounds, is <HI>all</HI> over which the fever, according to the be&s;t of my remembrance, exerted any power, till after it had reached its height; when it extended down Water-&s;treet, a little below Wall-&s;treet, and proved very mortal. It is true that there were a few per&s;ons affected in various other parts of the town; but, during the great part of the prevalence of the fever, it was principally active in the north-ea&s;tern and middle parts of the di&s;trict comprehended as above: and, as a thorough knowledge of the peculiarities of this portion of our city is, in my opinion, indi&s;pen&s;a|ble to the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e which afflicted it, I cannot doubt your patience with the minute de&s;crip|tion I think it nece&s;&s;ary to give.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious remark, on the greater part of the di&s;trict, ju&s;t pointed out, is, that it is the lowe&s;t, flatte&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;unken part of the whole city. Some places are much more &s;unken than others; but the whole &s;pace is evidently &s;o, compared with the adjacent ground; and appears to have an in|clination, more or le&s;s ob&s;ervable, in different &s;treets, to the Ea&s;t river. This inclination is very con&s;ider|able in Dover-&s;treet; a &s;treet which is &s;aid always to have &s;uffered from fevers of this kind, during the hot &s;ea&s;on. From the divi&s;ion of Pearl and Cherry-&s;treets, down the latter, the de&s;cent is rapid, to &s;ome where near James's-&s;treet; about which is the lowe&s;t part of the &s;treet, and from whence it is nearly level
<PB N="68" REF="031169_0072_0feb1261a1318730">
to the northern boundary. Beyond this bound, the ground ri&s;es again; and the made ground, by the river &s;ide, is al&s;o &s;omewhat elevated: &s;o likewi&s;e, is the whole of the ground over which the we&s;terly line pa&s;&s;es through Divi&s;ion, Chatham, &amp;c. &s;treets. Thus you will perceive, that the part of the city where the fever was mo&s;t active, for the longe&s;t period, forms, as it were, a ba&s;on, having its &s;ide, neare&s;t the water, a little inclined. Within this ba&s;on, there are &s;everal &s;maller cavities; one of which, in particular will re|quire a further de&s;cription. Tho&s;e &s;treets, al&s;o, which are not included in this hollow, but which lie along the river, will require &s;ome attention; which &s;hall be given them.</P>
<P>The extreme irregularity in the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;treets, and the narrowne&s;s of the greater number of them, are great ob&s;tacles to a free ventilation of this city. This misfortune, common to every part of it, falls with peculiar heavine&s;s on that di&s;trict which has ju&s;t been &s;poken of. The comparatively high and neighboring lands of Morri&s;&s;ania and Long-I&s;land, receive almo&s;t &s;olely the benefit of breezes from the north-ea&s;t and ea&s;t: The Sound, which divides them from the city, being too narrow to add much force and fre&s;hne&s;s to a breeze nearly &s;pent on their heights. North, the i&s;land ri&s;es into little hills, from which the wind pa&s;&s;es on to the high parts of the city; rarely vi&s;iting the low and intervening &s;pace; unle&s;s it may be the topmo&s;t rooms of the hou&s;es: and, as the hou&s;es are generally low, the effects of a wind from this quarter mu&s;t be incon&s;iderable.&mdash; North-we&s;terly, there is &s;omewhat more of an open|ing; but even this is &s;mall. We&s;t, &s;outh we&s;t, and &s;outh, the other parts of the town, which are higher, and thickly &s;ettled, break the force of the gales from the&s;e points. So that, thus &s;ituated, this quarter of
<PB N="69" REF="031169_0073_0feb126348f96ca0">
the city, though it were perfectly well laid out, would have but little chance for a free ventilation: irregu|larly di&s;po&s;ed and narrow as the &s;treets are, we mu&s;t be convinced of the impo&s;&s;ibility of its receiving the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply of fre&s;h air. You will under&s;tand me as &s;peaking of a thorough ventilation, and in the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on, when it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary: a partial &s;upply of air, equal to the &s;upport of a feveri&s;h exi&s;|tence, it undoubtedly obtains.</P>
<P>Much of the ground, in the northern part of this di&s;trict, is &s;wampy, and abounds with little pools and puddles of &s;tagnant water. This was e&s;pecially true la&s;t &s;ummer and autumn; there being great rains, and no adequate means for conducting off the water. Indeed, &s;o flat are &s;ome of the <HI>paved</HI> &s;treets, in this quarter, that the rains did not run down the gutters, but continued in little puddles, and were evaporated from the places whereon they fell. In the new &s;treets, which are unpaved, and without any gutters, numer|ous imperfect ditches a&s;&s;i&s;ted the di&s;po&s;ition of the water to &s;tagnate. The&s;e places were often mud|dy, when the &s;outhern part of the town was dry; and the &s;teams from them very offen&s;ive, when the dry &s;treets, towards the North river, were perfectly &s;weet.</P>
<P>Several of the paved &s;treets, and indeed the greater number, in the di&s;trict of which I am &s;peaking, are narrow and crooked; &s;ome with neither &s;ide walks nor gutters, and by far the large&s;t portion of them, mi&s;erably built. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e which are unpaved, are, in all re&s;pects, &s;till wor&s;e; the buildings chiefly wooden, and placed on the ground; the old ones falling to decay; the new, but imperfectly fini&s;hed. Of them all, it may be remarked, that they are much expo&s;ed, &s;ome of them more than others, to the full
<PB N="70" REF="031169_0074_0feb12665a6d51e0">
influence of the docks, whatever that may be, and it cannot be &s;alutary; or to that of a boiling &s;un, from early in the morning, till the middle of the afternoon; and &s;ome of them, to both.</P>
<P>So much for the &s;treets, generally: a few particu|lars, concerning &s;ome of them, are nece&s;&s;ary to the formation of a perfect idea of this di&s;trict.</P>
<P>A line, drawn from the corner of Ferry and Pearl-&s;treets, up the latter, to where William &s;treet enters it; then down William to Franckfort, and through that, a part of Gold and Ferry-&s;treets, to Pearl-&s;treet again, will form the ridge of a new cavity (included in the principal boundaries above mentioned) which &s;eems contrived, by art, for the dwelling place of fever. This court-yard of the palace of death, is di|vided by &s;everal di&s;mal lanes, courteou&s;ly denomi|nated &s;treets; &s;uch as Vandewater, Ro&s;e and Jacob-&s;treets, &amp;c. which form the borders to innumerable tan-vats. The whole is one va&s;t tan-yard, the firm parts of which &s;eem to have been con&s;tructed by art in the mid&s;t of an exten&s;ive quagmire. To this place, as far as I can di&s;cover, there is no outlet. Think what mu&s;t be the condition of it, in the months of Augu&s;t and September!&mdash;Yet human beings live here; and habit renders its noxious exhalations, in &s;ome &s;ort, harmle&s;s to them. It is remarkable that few per&s;ons, regularly inhabiting this hollow, died of the fever la&s;t year. To tho&s;e, who&s;e evil de&s;tiny led them to &s;eek a new dwelling place there, it proved highly pe&s;tilential.</P>
<P>Dover-&s;treet is a &s;hort, narrow &s;treet, running from the beginning of Cherry-&s;treet, down to the Ea&s;t river; and contains near twenty buildings.&mdash; The de&s;cent, from Cherry into Water-&s;treet, is very
<PB N="71" REF="031169_0075_0feb126975a12810">
rapid. As the expo&s;ure is nearly to the ea&s;t, it re|ceives the whole effect of the &s;un, from 6 A. M. to 3 P. M. in the &s;ummer. The de&s;cent makes it ea&s;y to keep the &s;urface of the &s;treet clean; though it pre|vents a free ventilation. But it has been rai&s;ed, &s;e|veral feet, &s;ince the buildings, which are mo&s;tly low, were erected; &s;o that the road is, in many in|&s;tances, up to the middle of the lower &s;tory windows; leaving the cellars to the hou&s;es, and cellar kitchens, without a communication with the &s;treet. The yards remaining as before, are, of con&s;equence, much lower than the &s;treet; without vent; and, of nece&s;|&s;ity, all the water, and filth of every kind, which gathers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n them, mu&s;t there &s;tagnate, ferment and putrify. Add to this, &s;ome of the&s;e yards are capa|cious, and contain little, decayed, wooden huts; &s;ometimes built directly on the ground; and contain|ing, oftentimes, &s;everal families.</P>
<P>Water-&s;treet, above Dover-&s;treet, is chiefly com|po&s;ed of low, decayed and dirty wooden buildings. This &s;treet being either made-ground entirely, or rai&s;ed like Dover-&s;treet, the &s;ame is true of the &s;itu|ation of the hou&s;es and yards. And, le&s;t any of the filth, or water, &s;hould drain off, from any of the yards, the we&s;tern &s;ide of Water-&s;treet has been kindly converted, by the enlightened zeal of the directors of the&s;e affairs, into a perfect dyke; which an&s;wers its de&s;ign, mo&s;t completely, by preventing even the &s;lighte&s;t leakage. Be&s;ide, as this &s;treet lies directly on the water, it has the benefit of the whole force of the &s;un, the greater part of the day; and of the exhalations from the docks; which are here in great number, and in the highe&s;t &s;tate of their per|fection. There is, however, a better opportunity for fre&s;h air, in this, than in &s;ome other &s;treets. Yet even this is an advantage which the rage for im|provement
<PB REF="031169_0076_0feb126c49c5f018">
threatens to transfer to a new &s;treet, &s;till further out in the river; which, if completed, may form another dyke, to the increa&s;ed plea&s;antne&s;s and health of this quarter of the town.</P>
<P>Of Roo&s;evelt, Catharine, James, Oliver, &amp;c. &s;treets, nearly the &s;ame remarks are true as of Dover and the upper part of Water-&s;treet: for though they are &s;omewhat wider, &s;traighter, and have more good and new buildings in them, yet they are rai&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, have &s;unken yards, and under-ground apartments; and Roo&s;evelt &s;treet has an open &s;ink, where the drippings of the tea-water pump, after having gently collected all the filth in their way, are received; and being ju&s;t enough to keep up a con|&s;tant dropping, and not enough to wa&s;h the gutter, or the &s;ewer, the &s;tench is mo&s;t intolerable, during the &s;ultry months.</P>
<P>To many other of the&s;e &s;treets the &s;ame remarks will apply; and to &s;ome with aggravated force: but what has been &s;aid, will, perhaps, be &s;ufficient to aid your imagination in the conception of a ju&s;t idea of their condition: I mean of their nece&s;&s;ary and una|voidable condition.</P>
<P>Of the Docks, it may be enough to mention, ge|nerally, that they are badly contrived in every part of the town; and wor&s;t of all, in this part; being broken up into numerous little wharves, thus form|ing narrow &s;lips, where the ground is left bare at ebb tide; and where vegetable, animal, and excremen|titious matters, being thrown in, at all times, in&s;tead of being ca&s;t into the &s;tream, ferment, putrify, and render the &s;tench truly pe&s;tiferous.

<P>In addition to the above-related facts, concerning the condition of the &s;treets, in that part of the city where care was mo&s;t needed, it may be remarked that, at no time, was there ever &s;o great an apparent inat|tention to pre&s;erving them clean. Be&s;ides the impe|diments which the level nature of the &s;treets, in many parts of the town, pre&s;ented to the draining off of the filth which is con&s;tantly accumulating in large towns like this, artificial impediments were permitted; as if death were not &s;ufficiently active, and needed the aid of the magi&s;trate. In all the &s;treets where buildings were going forward, the workmen were allowed to re&s;train the cour&s;e of the water, in the gutters, by forming little dams, for their convenience in making their morter. The effect of this &s;toppage of water was &s;o great, that even in Broadway, one of the &s;treets the be&s;t calculated of any in the city for free ventilation, in that part of it where the new Tontine Tavern was building, the &s;tench was exceed|ingly offen&s;ive. And in this condition was it allowed to remain for near two months; though it was al|mo&s;t under the windows of the principal magi&s;trate of the city. If this were true of the wide&s;t, and one of the be&s;t aired and cleane&s;t &s;treets, of New-York, what think you was the &s;tate of tho&s;e narrow, crook|ed, flat, unpaved, muddy alleys, mentioned above? No one can form even a faint idea who has not walked through them, in the middle of &s;ome one of tho&s;e deadly, &s;uffocative days, which we experienced in September la&s;t.</P>

The importance of this divi&s;ion of my &s;ubject, makes me regret that it is in my power to fur|ni&s;h you with no other than general information. You will be the more ready to overlook this defect, when you recollect that I do not pretend to deliver a hi&s;tory of the fever, and are informed that there is &s;ome probability that this particular defect will be &s;upplied by another hand.</P>
<P>Generally, then&mdash;every one knows that the &s;um|mer and autumn of 1795 were exce&s;&s;ively &s;ultry and exce&s;&s;ively wet. Every article of hou&s;ehold furni|ture, or in u&s;e about a hou&s;e, &s;u&s;ceptible of mould, was &s;peedily and deeply covered with it. It &s;eemed to penetrate places where we &s;hould have deemed its appearance impo&s;&s;ible. A friend of mine found a pocket-book of Morocco leather quite mouldy; though it was in the drawer of a private de&s;k, inclo&s;ed within a large de&s;k&mdash;both of which were u&s;ually locked&mdash;and covered by papers. Boots and &s;hoes hung up by a wall, near a fire-place, heated every day, contracted mould within twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>Meats &s;poiled in the market-place uncommonly quick; and tho&s;e which were brought home, appa|rently fre&s;h and good, in the morning, were often found unfit to be eaten, when cooked and brought upon table.</P>
<P>E&s;culent vegetables, in general, and e&s;pecially fruits, were unu&s;ually poor, tough and ta&s;tele&s;s. The peach, particularly that called the cling-&s;tone, was &s;carcely dige&s;tible; and often occa&s;ioned temporary

I mention this that no mi&s;take may ari&s;e from the above remark concerning e&s;culent vegetables.

<P>Flies were very numerous and trouble&s;ome, in every part of the city, in the beginning of &s;ummer; but they &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, about the middle of July, from the more airy parts of the town, collecting in &s;warms, in the le&s;s healthy parts, and &s;ucceeded, every where, by clouds of mu&s;ketoes, incredibly large and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: and the&s;e continued to afflict us, long after the time when they commonly depart. Almo&s;t every per&s;on &s;uffered exceedingly from the bites of the&s;e in&s;ects; and foreigners e&s;pecially. In &s;ome they occa&s;ioned univer&s;al &s;wellings, and erup|tions, &s;omewhat like Pemphigus; and in others nu|merous little ulcers.

The irritation, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and con&s;equent watchfulne&s;s and fatigue, occa&s;ioned by the&s;e animals, no doubt predi&s;po&s;ed the well to be affected by the fever; while they extremely harra&s;&s;ed the &s;ick, and retarded their recovery.</P>
<P>During the whole of this &s;ea&s;on, I remember but one thunder-&s;torm; and this was very gentle. There was but a &s;ingle <HI>hard</HI> clap of thunder, for more than four months, that I remember; and very little thun|der and lightning, at any time.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER FOURTH.</HI> Some circum&s;tances relative to the principal &s;ufferers by the Fever of <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is a fact, generally admitted, I believe, that, of tho&s;e who were &s;ick and who died of the Fever of 1795, the greater number were foreigners: per&s;ons, either ju&s;t arrived from other States, from the We&s;t-Indies, and from Europe; or who had not been many months, or years, &s;ettled in this city. It is probable that the proportion of citizens, who died, to &s;trangers, did not exceed one to &s;even. Of the&s;e &s;trangers, it is thought, a large number were Iri&s;h; and there are &s;ome rea&s;ons why this &s;hould be true; but I cannot pretend to know it to be &s;o, from my own ob&s;erva|tion. The cau&s;es productive of di&s;ea&s;e in foreign|ers, in tho&s;e of this nation in particular, are numer|ous, and &s;ome of them de&s;erve particu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r attention. This I de&s;ign to be&s;tow upon them, after remarking, that, both among natives and foreigners, the &s;everity of the di&s;ea&s;e was experienced by the poor.</P>
<P N="1">I. Dr. Blane, in his ob&s;ervations on the di&s;ea&s;es of &s;eamen, remarks, <Q>that it &s;ometimes happens, that a &s;hip, with a long e&s;tabli&s;hed crew, &s;hall be very <HI>healthy;</HI> yet, if &s;trangers are introduced among them, who are al&s;o <HI>healthy,</HI> &s;ickne&s;s will be mu|tually produced;</Q> and Dr. Ru&s;h, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t vo|lume of his "Medical Ob&s;ervations and Inquiries" takes notice of this remark of Dr. Blane's, and con|firms it, by a reference to the experience of our coun|try, during the late war. The&s;e are his words&mdash; <Q>The hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es furni&s;hes many proofs of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;It was very remarkable, that, while the American army at Cambridge, in

the year 1775, con&s;i&s;ted only of New-England men (who&s;e habits and manners were the &s;ame) there was &s;carcely any &s;ickne&s;s among them. It was not till the troops of the ea&s;tern, middle and &s;outhern &s;tates, met at New-York and Ticonderoga, in the year 1776, that the Typhus became univer|&s;al, and &s;pread with &s;uch peculiar mortality in the armies of the United States.</Q></P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge, in this place, on the oppre&s;&s;ions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of what are called the lower order of the people in Europe. War, which doubles the burthens upon every rank in &s;ociety, exerci&s;es an aggravated violence upon the poor. This violence, &s;everely felt by all, in England, chiefly falls upon the manufacturing poor; who are, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t ignorant, abject and depraved: in Ireland, its effects are more general, including in its circle of wretchedne&s;s, the cultivator, as well as the mechanic. The pre&s;ent war in Europe, unparalelled as it is for the number of men involved in it, has given birth to oppre&s;&s;ions and calamities equally new and de&s;truct|ive. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, and when men of fortune and re&s;pectability, di&s;gu&s;ted and di&s;heartened at the enormous ma&s;s of mi&s;ery which every day and every hour pre&s;ented to their view, turned their thoughts towards another hemi&s;phere, it is not to be wondered at, that the wretched and depre&s;&s;ed poor &s;hould pant for a &s;ettlement in a country, where li|berty is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> portion of every man, and independence the &s;ure crown of all his hone&s;t labors; and which had been, <HI>fallaciou&s;ly,</HI> repre&s;ented as courting their ac|ceptance, and loading their untoiling hands with every gift of fortune.&mdash;The real ble&s;&s;ings of our go|vernment and country are precious and ine&s;timable; but they are of a nature not to be felt and enjoyed by minds depraved by ignorance and deba&s;ed by &s;lavery.

That temperate enjoyment of the goods of life, and moderate exerci&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings of independence, which, alone, enlightened liberty &s;anctions, can neither be conceived of, nor reli&s;hed, by tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to crouch beneath the iron rod of de&s;poti&s;m. Liberty, according to their ideas, was the rever&s;e of all they felt; and independence, the unlimited gratifica|tion of all their appetites. The mi&s;repre&s;entations, too, of &s;peculating and unprincipled men, who were inte|re&s;ted in the &s;ale of large tracts of un&s;ettled territory, had fo&s;tered and extended the&s;e erroneous concep|tions. Hence, when the poor and mi&s;erable emi|grants, on their arrival here, found that neither gold, nor farms, &s;olicited their acceptance; that, in Ame|rica, as well as in Europe, their life was alike de&s;tined to be a life of toil; when they perceived that licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, the only liberty of which they had any no|tion, brought puni&s;hment along with it; the di&s;appoint|ment, new and unexpected, became a powerful ag|gravation to every other cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e. You will not under&s;tand me as extending the&s;e la&s;t remarks to all emigrants to this country, nor &s;uppo&s;e that de|ceived hope was pre&s;ent, or active, in every ca&s;e.

Of the&s;e, the large&s;t portions fell to the &s;hare of the States of Penn&s;ylvania and New-York; and the mo&s;t worthle&s;s and profligate, proba|bly, re&s;ted in the capitals of tho&s;e States.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="031169_0086_0feb129804dd8778">The di&s;tre&s;&s;es in the We&s;t-Indies, e&s;pecially tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by the de&s;truction of Cape Francai&s;e, obliged numbers of the i&s;landers, white, mulatto and black, to take refuge here. This circum&s;tance, harmle&s;s, in great mea&s;ure, to the people them|&s;elves, can &s;carcely be con&s;idered as &s;o, in relation to the whole.

<P>This collection of &s;trangers, from various parts of Europe and America, which had been rapidly form|ing for two or three years, was greatly increa&s;ed by repeated arrivals of large importations from Great-Britain and Ireland, during the fall of 1794, and the &s;pring and &s;ummer of 1795. One or two &s;hips came into this port, after the commencement of the fever, filled with emigrants.</P>
<P>If, then, the opinion of Dr. Blane, corroborated by the te&s;timony of Dr. Ru&s;h, be founded in truth; that the &s;udden intermingling of people of various and di&s;cordant habits, climates and nations, be a circum|&s;tance favoring the production of di&s;ea&s;e; this cau&s;e of fever was certainly pre&s;ent, in New-York, in the year 1795.</P>

<P>The healthine&s;s and unhealthine&s;s of a climate, or the effect wrought on the human con&s;titution by a change of climate, mu&s;t be more or le&s;s con&s;iderable, according to the extent of its connection with other circum&s;tances. How far &s;uch a connection was ob|&s;ervable in this city, in re&s;pect to the Fever of 1795, will appear by and bye.</P>
<P>Two remarks may be made, concerning the emi|grants from the We&s;t-Indies. The fir&s;t is, that they generally bear the fir&s;t winter, after their arrival in the middle and northern &s;tates, better than the na|tives, while they are le&s;s incommoded by the &s;um|mer heats. The &s;econd is, that they &s;uffer le&s;s from Fevers, during the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on, than Emigrants from Europe. It &s;eems difficult to explain the fir&s;t men|tioned fact; the &s;econd I &s;hall attempt to account for, hereafter.</P>
<P>The climate of this part of America differs from that of Great-Britain and Ireland in the inten&s;er cold of its winters; more extreme and longer continued heat of its &s;ummers; and the greater variablene&s;s of its temperature.</P>
<P>The great body of emigrants come over to Ame|rica in large companies, crouded together in one &s;hip, and ill-accommodated in every re&s;pect. After a long voyage, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, in an uncommon degree, to the influence of a new climate, and to every &s;udden variation of
<PB N="84" REF="031169_0088_0feae5209bfbcd98">
temperature. If they arrive, as is often the ca&s;e, in the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on, the effects of a change of climate mu&s;t be felt in all their force. The heats of the &s;ummer mu&s;t render them le&s;s able to cope with the ruggedne&s;s of the following winter; as the &s;everity of the winter makes them more unfit to endure the &s;corching &s;un of the &s;ucceeding &s;ummer. This will account for the &s;uffering of many who had pa&s;&s;ed a &s;ea&s;on in the country before.</P>
<P>To this it may be added, that, in 1795, the cli|mate mu&s;t have been particularly bad; &s;ince it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have preternaturally affected the na|tives of the country. This being admitted, it is not difficult to conceive of its having had a pernicious influence on &s;trangers; and being, therefore, fairly enumerable among the cau&s;es predi&s;po&s;ing to the fever of this &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">III. An animal diet, or a great u&s;e of animal food, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer, and when there is general di&s;|po&s;ition to fevers, is thought by many phy&s;icians, of our own and other countries, to favor their produc|tion; and a vegetable diet, on the contrary, to be a preventative, or pre&s;ervative, again&s;t them.

They complain, and with apparent ju&s;tice, of the im|perfect action which fire is allowed to exert upon them; and repre&s;ent us as little better than the Aby|&s;inians, who devour a part of the ox, while he is yet expiring.&mdash;It is certain that a great change is ob&s;erv|able in the appearance and kind of di&s;ea&s;es, in the United States, &s;ince our citizens have &s;ub&s;tituted fre&s;h meats, for &s;alted, in &s;ummer.&mdash;Some rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for this effect, which would countenance the opinion of the French; but they will &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to your own mind, and would require more room than I can allow them, in this place.&mdash; But, &s;urely, if meats be prejudicial to health, in our hot &s;ea&s;ons; if they expo&s;e us, by their u&s;e, to di&s;ea&s;es of the kind, which prevailed here, la&s;t year; how pe|culiarly mu&s;t this evil have been felt by us, when they were in a condition &s;o uncommonly bad as the year 1795&mdash;If the wealthy often had meats brought upon their tables, in a &s;tate of incipient putre&s;cency, what mu&s;t have been the &s;tate of tho&s;e which were con&s;umed by the poor?&mdash;Add to this, that the vege|tables principally u&s;ed among us, are not di&s;tingui&s;hed for their a&s;ce&s;cency.&mdash;The&s;e remarks apply to all ranks of our inhabitants; and plainly &s;hew that the &s;ituation of our city, the la&s;t year, was unu&s;ually bad, in this re&s;pect, for natives, as well as foreigners.

<P>The poor of Europe, and e&s;pecially of Ireland, are but &s;paringly accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of meat. In that i&s;land, it is not uncommon for people to pa&s;s through life, without ever having ta&s;ted it, except by &s;tealth, accident, or on holydays.&mdash;In this country, the great
<PB N="86" REF="031169_0090_0feb1291c3330bc8">
u&s;e of meat produces a comparative &s;cantine&s;s in the &s;upply of vegetables; and a proportionate poorne&s;s and dearne&s;s of them. This is &s;ufficient to determine the choice of the poor towards the u&s;e of meat; and produce, in the emigrant poor, an almo&s;t total and &s;udden change, in their aliment. When, too, we re|collect that animal food is more gratifying to a de|praved ta&s;te; that it provokes to greater repletion, than vegetable food; that it is more nece&s;&s;ary to hard laborers; and that it is mo&s;t craved by tho&s;e who in|dulge in the habitual u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits; we are alive, at once, to the full perception of the mi&s;chiev|ous effects ari&s;ing from &s;uch a &s;ub&s;titute, to their for|mer bland and &s;canty meals. In tho&s;e, with whom this change of diet took place the la&s;t year, for the fir&s;t, the con&s;equences mu&s;t have been &s;till more per|nicious. For we ought to con&s;ider that if the poor always con&s;ume the wor&s;t provi&s;ions, tho&s;e who were &s;trangers, as well as poor, were lea&s;t likely to procure tho&s;e which were good; and the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;ervation is &s;ufficient to convince us, that their bad qualities could not have been much obviated by the prepara|tion common among the con&s;umers.</P>
<P>May we not, then, conclude&mdash;that the aliment u&s;ed by the citizens, generally, was favorable to the production of di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;and that the great and &s;udden change of diet, among the emigrants, con&s;idering the nature of their food in 1795, mu&s;t have di&s;po&s;ed them, in a particular manner, to be affected by the fever of the country?</P>

In vain has the eloquence of the mo&s;t en|lightened phy&s;icians and morali&s;ts been exerted again&s;t them, for centuries: governments con&s;titute it the intere&s;t of individuals to prepare and circulate them; they withhold from men that knowledge which would teach them to &s;hun, or elevate them above the u&s;e of, intoxicating liquors; and prejudices are excited and fo&s;tered in their favor, that the igno|rant and depraved, to whom they form a congenial gratification, may continue to con&s;ume them; to the de&s;truction of morals, the emolument of di&s;tillers, and the augmentation of the revenue. As they are more ea&s;ily and cheaply obtained in America, than in Eu|rope; as the wages of laborers are more con&s;iderable here, than there, and therefore permit them greater indulgences; as there is every encouragement from example; and as a fiercer &s;un, according to common notions, ju&s;tifies a more prodigal u&s;e of them; it is naturally &s;uppo&s;eable that the emigrants of the la|boring cla&s;s indulged in them, to an unu&s;ual degree.

1795; or, more properly, on what is there reported to be the fact.&mdash;I &s;hall quote, from this letter, the pa&s;&s;age referred to.</P>
<P><Q>On the 20th day of July, Doctor Malachi Treat, the late Health-Officer of this port, vi&s;ited the brig Zephyr, from Port-au-Prince; on board of which he found three per&s;ons ill of fever, and the corp&s;e of one who died that morning. The Doctor calls the Fever, in his report, a Bilious-remitting Fever. The brig was ordered to ride quarantine. On the 22d day of July, Dr. Treat was taken ill, and died on the 30th, of a fever marked by a yellow &s;kin, hemorrhages, vomiting of black matter, re&s;embling coffee-grounds, and all &s;uch &s;ymptoms as charac|terize bilious fevers of the malignant kind.&mdash;On the 25th day of July, four per&s;ons, from on board the &s;hip William, from Liverpool, which arrived here &s;everal weeks before (all the crew having, previous to that day, and during the voyage, been perfectly healthy) were taken ill of Fever, attended with &s;imilar &s;ymptoms; and all died within &s;even days.</Q></P>

re&s;ide; and ever has &s;uffered mo&s;t from the regular autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, as well as from any new and uncommon complaint. From all which cir|cum&s;tances, we entertain no doubt but that the &s;eamen of the &s;hip William contracted the di&s;ea&s;e, of which they died, here, and did not introduce it into the city.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A little before, and immediately after, the attack of the &s;eamen of the &s;hip William, which fir&s;t called the attention of this Committee, &s;everal other per&s;ons, in Water and Front-&s;treets, and in the neighborhood of Dover-&s;treet, were &s;eized with fever, which, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e ca&s;es which proved mortal, was marked by &s;evere vomitings, a yellow &s;kin, hemorrhagy, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a vomiting a black matter, re&s;embling coffee-grounds,&mdash;and which generally terminated within &s;even days, and proved fatal to more, in proportion to the number &s;eized, than is u&s;ual in the ordinary complaints of the &s;ea&s;on, in this city.</Q></P>
<P>Two remarks of con&s;iderable importance are natu|rally &s;ugge&s;ted by a careful examination of the above quotation: Fir&s;t, that the Committee appear to have &s;uppo&s;ed Dr. Treat, alone, to have received the di&s;|ea&s;e of which he died, from the Zephyr; and, &s;e|condly, that they have, in &s;ome &s;ort, admitted the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e as the Fever of 1795, originating here, in their &s;tatement of the circum|&s;tances relative to the &s;hip William. It is true that they are inexplicit, in both in&s;tances; and the only ab&s;olute conclu&s;ion which we are ju&s;tified in deduc|ing from what they &s;ay is, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not introduced into this city by the &s;hip William. This, however, narrows the ground of controver&s;y, con&s;i|derably; for no ve&s;&s;els be&s;ide the William and the
<PB REF="031169_0102_0feb12aa5422f7e0">
Zephyr, as far as I can learn, have ever been &s;u&s;pected of introducing any di&s;ea&s;e, of this kind, into this city. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, only to di&s;prove the a&s;&s;er|tion, in re&s;pect to the Zephyr, and the whole founda|tion of the doctrine of importation is de&s;troyed.&mdash; But, even were we to admit that Dr. Treat did actu|ally derive the fever of which he died, from the Ze|phyr, as no other per&s;on is known to have been in|fected by that ve&s;&s;el, and as the doctor communi|cated it to no per&s;on, the advocates for importation would not be greatly benefited by our conce&s;&s;ion. But, no &s;uch conce&s;&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary. The following papers, copies of which I am kindly permitted to tran&s;mit to you, appear to me, to e&s;tabli&s;h it, beyond contradiction, that neither Dr. Treat, nor any other per&s;on, contracted a Fever, &s;uch as prevailed in New-York, in 1795, from any &s;ick, or dead, man, or any thing el&s;e, connected with the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion.</P>

<P>Captain Comfort Bird, commander of the brig Ze|phyr, of Bo&s;ton, &s;ailed from Port-au-Prince on the 1&s;t of July, and arrived at New-York on the 20th of the &s;ame month. The mate and one mariner had the Fe|ver and Ague &s;eventeen days on &s;hore, and came on board with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; and the captain him&s;elf had a Dy&s;entery on his arrival in New-York;&mdash;and John Wheeler, aged 16 years, died on the day of the arrival of the brig at New-York, by worms crawling up into his throat and choaking him. He was &s;ewed up in a piece of canva&s;s, and ready to be committed to the deep, when the late Health-Officer came on board, who de&s;ired the captain to have the canva&s;s opened, that he might in&s;pect the body&mdash;and he only cut the canva&s;s open over the face, and viewed the countenance, but did not make any other examina|tion of the body,&mdash;which was, &s;oon after, carried to Governor's I&s;land, and there interred.&mdash;The young

</LETTER>
<P>OF the undoubted veracity of Captain Bird I am a&s;&s;ured by Dr. Dingley, who is per&s;onally acquainted with him, and attended him, at the time, for the dy&s;entery mentioned in the depo&s;ition. The opinion, therefore, that the Yellow Fever, or a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, was brought into the city, la&s;t year, by the brig Zephyr, &s;eems wholly un&s;upported by evidence. Neither is it nece&s;&s;ary that any imputation &s;hould re&s;t on the memory of Dr. Treat. He &s;aw the mariners after they had been long affected by the Fever and ague, and perhaps with &s;ome fever upon them at the time; and from the yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, common to the ad|vanced &s;tate of that di&s;ea&s;e, e&s;pecially in hot climates, might be ea&s;ily induced to &s;uppo&s;e it a remittent. This, however, is mere conjecture, and not nece&s;&s;ary to be admitted, &s;ince the fact of the men having been &s;ick &s;eventeen days, previous to their embarking for our coa&s;t, is ample proof that their could not have been affected by the fever which prevailed and was
<PB N="101" REF="031169_0105_0feb12af15d95a70">
&s;o mortal, here.&mdash;Indeed, the whole te&s;timony in favor of the idea of importation, is too loo&s;e and &s;light to build any rational opinion upon. The very words of the Committee are calculated to &s;trengthen a con|trary opinion, if rightly con&s;idered; for they not only countenance the idea that the people of the &s;hip Wil|liam became &s;ick from the unhealthine&s;s of the place where they dwelt, but, al&s;o, that the Fever had made its appearance, in various other of the neighboring hou&s;es and &s;treets, previous to their being &s;eized with it. And what confirms the truth of this opinion is, that per&s;ons were taken with the di&s;temper, about this time, in other parts of the city, who had no connection with the brig Zephyr, nor with any other ve&s;&s;el, and who&s;e illne&s;s may be &s;atisfactorily ac|counted for from their &s;ituation, in other re&s;pects. An in&s;tance of this kind fell under my own ob&s;erva|tion, the la&s;t of July; &s;everal &s;imilar ca&s;es have been related to me; and one, if I am not mi&s;informed, occurred in the New-York Alms-hou&s;e, where the di&s;ea&s;e was di&s;tinctly marked, before Dr. Treat's ill|ne&s;s.&mdash;The following &s;tatement of facts, too, will convince every candid mind, that we ought to look at home, for the cau&s;e of this Fever.</P>
<P>The &s;hip Connecticut came to Fitch's wharf, about the 20th of July&mdash;I think it was on the 21&s;t: &s;he had ju&s;t arrived from &s;ome part of England, and the people were perfectly healthy. No ve&s;&s;el &s;u&s;pected of being infected, came to this wharf, during the &s;ea&s;on; though the &s;hip William lay at the next wharf, at the di&s;tance of about two hundred feet,&mdash;and Mr. Fitch gives the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;uran|ces that all the articles in his &s;tore, at this time, were in good condition. At this wharf the &s;hip Connec|ticut continued till after the middle of Augu&s;t. The owner was employed about the &s;hip, great part of
<PB N="102" REF="031169_0106_0feb12b4ad9f5240">
the day; but ate and &s;lept in an airy part of the town. The people of the &s;hip either &s;tayed on board, or at public hou&s;es near by.&mdash;On the evening of the 25th of July, the owner was &s;eized with the fever; I &s;aw him the 27th; he had good accommodations, was in a favorable part of the town, in the third &s;tory of the hou&s;e, and recovered after an illne&s;s of about ten days, which was never very dangerous, though the attack was &s;evere.&mdash;About this time, one of the mates, the &s;teward, and two of the mariners, of the &s;hip Con|necticut, were &s;eized in the &s;ame way, and with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms, as the owner. They continued in the &s;hip, or its neighborhood, and all died. I did not &s;ee them, but was informed, by the owner, that the mate, in particular, <HI>vomited large quantities of blood, and expired delirious.</HI></P>
<P>Three per&s;ons, who were in Mr. Fitch's &s;tore, were taken &s;ick, and two died, of the Fever. One &s;ickened on the 26th of July, one on the 6th, and the other on the 9th of Augu&s;t. It was common for all the&s;e per&s;ons to &s;it <Q>&s;everal hours, in the morn|ing, in the &s;tore, with empty &s;tomachs,&mdash;inhaling the effluvia of the night.</Q></P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t per&s;ons, who died of the Fever, was one <Q>who lived at the head of the wharf, and had been confined for &s;everal months with a rheu|matic complaint.</Q></P>
<P>For the facts contained in the two la&s;t paragraphs, I am indebted to a communication from Mr. Fitch to Dr. Dingley, which that gentleman has allowed me to make u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion. The account which it contains of the condition of the wharves in his neighborhood, adds new force to the other te&s;timony in favor of the opinion that the Fever originated here; and is too much to the purpo&s;e to be omitted. The&s;e are his words:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="031169_0107_0feb12b7a9550630"><Q>I am po&s;itive that the di&s;order has originated from local cau&s;es&mdash;becau&s;e, it has appeared in this quarter, at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, for &s;everal years pa&s;t: the cau&s;e why it has is, to me, my&s;terious; but what appears to me mo&s;t probable is, the central &s;ituation, and the motion of the tides. The tide of flood &s;ets directly into the&s;e wharves; col|lecting all the vapors and effluvia of the city.&mdash; The &s;ituation of the ground, between Water and Cherry-&s;treets, is rendered noxious by rai&s;ing Water-&s;treet, and confining the &s;tagnant waters.&mdash; The emptying of tubs into the head of the docks, in&s;tead of the end of the wharves, although not peculiar to this part of the city, is a horrible nui|&s;ance; particularly in time of &s;ickne&s;s.&mdash;The pon|ding of water, by running a bulk-head athwart a dock, and leaving the vacancy for years, to be filled up with every &s;pecies of filth and putridity, is an object worth your attention.</Q></P>
<P>A confirmation of the facts, and &s;ome of the opi|nions, contained in this extract, may be found in a very &s;ingular epi&s;tle from the late Dr. W^m^. Pitt Smith, to Dr. Duffield &s;en. of Philadelphia, dated Septem|ber 1&s;t, 1795; which I pre&s;ume you have &s;een and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>On the whole, though I am not prepared to main|tain that infectious di&s;ea&s;es, and the Yellow Fever among others, may not be, and have not been, im|ported, and thus &s;pread over parts of our country, yet this is the mo&s;t that can be allowed to the coun|tenancers of the doctrine. For, after all, the te&s;ti|mony of numerous facts furni&s;hes clear, indubitable, and deci&s;ive evidence, that other and peculiar cir|cum&s;tances mu&s;t concur with &s;uch importation, to
<PB N="104" REF="031169_0108_0feb12baa82fd780">
effect any general di&s;tribution, circulation, or influ|ence of the di&s;ea&s;e. Frequent in&s;tances have occurred, nay do occur every year, of per&s;ons returning, from the We&s;t-Indies, &s;ick with the Yellow Fever; lan|gui&s;hing, for &s;ome time, in the hou&s;es of their pa|rents, or friends; recovering, or dying; attended by numbers, during their illne&s;s; their very clothes, where they have died, afterwards worn by their re|lations; and yet no ill effects following therefrom.&mdash; While I re&s;ided at Wethersfield, in Connecticut, I had opportunity of obtaining preci&s;e information of &s;everal &s;uch ca&s;es; and it is a well-e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, in many in&s;tances during our Fever, and e&s;pecially dur|ing that of Philadelphia, in 1793.</P>
<P>The whole, therefore, that can be granted, or ought to be a&s;&s;umed by tho&s;e who maintain the di&s;|ea&s;e which prevailed in New-York in 1795, to have been imported is,&mdash;That infection may be brought into any place (and therefore into this city) from abroad; that, under certain circum&s;tances of the place, where it is introduced, it becomes very active and de&s;tructive; but that, when the&s;e circum&s;tances do not exi&s;t, however the per&s;on immediately af|fected,&mdash;if it be introduced by a &s;ick per&s;on&mdash;may &s;uffer, it is harmle&s;s, &s;o far as the general health of that place is concerned.&mdash;If the &s;ubject were viewed in this light, as mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it ought to be, the que&s;tion of importation, or non-importation, would &s;ink into it's merited in&s;ignificance; the efficient cau&s;e, the <HI>cau&s;a fine qua non,</HI> of &s;uch Fevers, would be clearly di&s;cerned as depending on local circum|&s;tances, capable of being wholly changed; the ab&s;o|lute madne&s;s of further delay, in effecting &s;uch a change, would be di&s;tinctly and deeply felt; a becom|ing &s;pirit would animate the citizens; and &s;uitable exertions &s;peedily place us beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="105" REF="031169_0109_0feb12bd75fabda8">
being &s;ubjected to a misfortune, &s;imilar to that which has been already &s;u&s;tained. For it is inconceivable that the nature and extent of the evil &s;hould be un|der&s;tood, and the remedy not be applied: and a comparatively &s;light and temporaly &s;acrifice of pro|perty, would render this city, in reality, what the mi&s;taken policy, or pride, of &s;ome of its inhabitants now fal&s;ely repre&s;ent it,&mdash;as healthy as any in the world; and leave nothing to fear, either from the Fevers of the Indies, or the Plague of the Levant.&mdash;But, while people continue to fo&s;ter a ridiculous vanity, con|cerning the city in which they re&s;ide; while they fear that its reputation will be wounded, by permitting an idea to get abroad, that it is unhealthy; while tho&s;e engaged in commerce cheri&s;h the error, from an apprehen&s;ion that their intere&s;ts would &s;uffer from a di&s;clo&s;ure of the truth; while men, inve&s;ted with the &s;acred character of phy&s;icians, countenance fal&s;e opinions, either through ignorance, a reprehen&s;ible ti|midity, or that they may gather unde&s;erved popularity and wealth; and while the magi&s;tracy are more actuated by a mean regard for offices dependent on popular opi|nion, and maintained by a compliance with it, at all hazards, than by a ju&s;t and enlightened zeal for the &s;afety and happine&s;s of their fellow-citizens; Truth may be &s;poken, but there is no hope that it will be attended to. Con&s;iderations of <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> intere&s;t, &s;o various and &s;o forcible, take deep root in the minds of men who look only to the pre&s;ent moment, and are either incapable of comprehending the whole of a &s;ubject, or unwilling to be&s;tow on it the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;ideration. Thus circum&s;tanced, they &s;trive to bani&s;h from others, and to &s;mother in their own brea&s;ts, tho&s;e convictions which irre&s;i&s;tible evidence forces upon them: as if it were po&s;&s;ible that truth could be noxious.&mdash;Nothing can be more melancho|ly than to ob&s;erve this wilful blindne&s;s, this ob&s;ti|nate per&s;i&s;tency in error, the con&s;equences of which
<PB N="106" REF="031169_0110_0feb12c04815c360">
have been &s;o dreadful already, and threaten to be &s;till more &s;o hereafter.&mdash;Were it po&s;&s;ible to impre&s;s the truth vividly on the minds of the great body of citizens; to rouze men into action; to excite a generous di&s;regard for temporary advantages, and a lively intere&s;t for the future welfare of them&s;elves and their po&s;terity; a few weeks might enable us to bid defiance to death, in many of the forms in which he now a&s;&s;ails us.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER SEVENTH.</HI> Was the Fever of <HI>1795</HI> an Epidemic? Was it Con|tagious?</HEAD>
<P>HAVING determined, to my own &s;atisfaction at lea&s;t, what were the remote or predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es of the Fever of 1795, I might now proceed to a de&s;cription of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, were it not proper to take &s;ome notice of two que&s;tions, which have been con&s;idera|tion agitated, viz. Whether the Fever was, as the Health Committee term it, an Epidemic?&mdash;And, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, Contagious?&mdash;On both the&s;e que&s;tions, I &s;hall deliver my opinion, in as &s;uccinct a manner as the &s;ubject will permit.</P>
<P><HI>Was the Fever epidemic?</HI>&mdash;A principal difficulty oc|curs in the very out&s;et of this enquiry; for different writers have made u&s;e of the term Epidemic, diffe|rently; &s;ome giving it a <HI>general,</HI> others a more <HI>particu|lar</HI> and <HI>preci&s;e</HI> &s;ignification. Thus Van Swieten, in his Commentary on the 1380th Aphori&s;m of Boerhaave, places <HI>epidemic</HI> in contradi&s;tinction to <HI>endemic;</HI> while Cleghorn, a writer of de&s;erved authority, in the In|troduction to his Ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;ea&s;es, &amp;c.
<PB N="107" REF="031169_0111_0feb12c3620dc9e8">
of Minorca, p. 74. con&s;titutes a cla&s;s of <HI>endemic</HI> di&s;|ea&s;es, which he divides into <HI>epidemic</HI> and <HI>&s;poradic.</HI>&mdash; Examples of like di&s;&s;imilarities, in the u&s;e of the&s;e words, are frequently to be met with, in authors of equal credit. And thus it may po&s;&s;ibly happen, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, as on many former occa&s;ions, that the whole contention ari&s;es from different con|ceptions of the import of a particular word.&mdash;But our bu&s;ine&s;s is rather with facts, than with definitions; I &s;hall &s;tate to you, therefore, what appears to me to have been the truth; and, perhaps, in the conclu&s;ion of my &s;tatement, a definition will be found.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, every per&s;on conver&s;ant with the practice of phy&s;ic in New-York, knows that a Fever, generally of the remittent or continued kind, and va|riou&s;ly denominated by medical writers, prevails in this city, to a greater or le&s;s degree, every year; per|haps I may &s;ay throughout the year&mdash;but, certainly, in every part of it, except the winter, and particularly from July to December: its greate&s;t height being in the months of Augu&s;t, September and October. The violence of this di&s;ea&s;e is increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed by con&s;titutional peculiarities, and by the particular &s;itu|ation of the patient in re&s;pect to air, temperature, &amp;c. &amp;c. Its univer&s;ality, likewi&s;e, may be con&s;idered as dependent, in a degree, on the &s;ame cau&s;es.&mdash;Cir|cum&s;tances, peculiar to &s;ome &s;ituations or individuals, occa&s;ion it to prove mortal, with high marks of ma|lignity, in certain in&s;tances, almo&s;t every year. That an exten&s;ion of the&s;e peculiarities, &s;o as to make them common to the citizens generally, would pro|duce the &s;ame effects on the many, as on the few, &s;eems hardly controvertible. Now, this appears, to me, to have been the ca&s;e, the la&s;t year; and I have no doubt of the identity of the Fever which then raged here, with that which has prevailed here in
<PB REF="031169_0112_0feb12c65b7da4b8">
former years; and con&s;ider it only as a higher grade of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;Compare the hi&s;tory of Fevers, in Sheffield, with that of Fevers in New-York.&mdash;We have a Fever, every year, at a particular &s;ea&s;on, u&s;u|ally called the bilious-remitting Fever: in Sheffield, at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, a Fever prevails, called the inter|mitting Fever. This la&s;t evidently depends on the peculiarities of Sheffield&mdash;&s;uch as its ponds, mar&s;hes, &amp;c.&mdash;So, in my opinion, does the former ari&s;e from the peculiarities of New-York.&mdash;The &s;ea&s;on of 1795 was a remarkable one: Was there any apparent change in the Fever of Sheffield? Yes: the &s;ymp|toms were remarkably heightened; &s;ome new ap|pearances were ob&s;ervable; and the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;toni&s;h|ingly ob&s;tinate. And was not this, al&s;o, true of New-York? Who will venture to deny it?&mdash;Were either of the&s;e Fevers propagated to other, or neighboring, places? No. You have certified this of the Fever in Sheffield; and I have heard of no in&s;tance of the kind, in relation to that of New-York. Both Fevers, then, were <HI>proper</HI> to the places in which they prevailed; and the inference which it would be natural to deduce from this is, that both were <HI>endemic,</HI> and not <HI>epidemic:</HI> for the term epidemic &s;eems to include in it the ca|pability of diffu&s;ion or propagation, without re&s;pect to the &s;ituation and con&s;titution of the patient; which the term endemic certainly does not. But, which|ever of the&s;e titles may be regarded as mo&s;t appropri|ate, the fact will not be varied by the u&s;e of either; and that you will under&s;tand to be, according to my belief, as above-&s;tated. That the Fever of 1795 was no other than a higher grade of that which prevails here, in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, every year; deriving its &s;e|verity entirely from the peculiarities of the &s;ea&s;on, &amp;c. as related, at large, in the preceding letters.</P>
<P><PB REF="031169_0113_0feb12ca54b9c940"><HI>Was the Fever contagious?</HI> Concerning the an&s;wer to be made to this, as well as to the former que&s;tion, there has been &s;ome di&s;pute; but, in this ca&s;e, as in that, as much difficulty has ari&s;en in &s;ettling the im|port of the phra&s;eology, as in determining the fact.</P>
<P>If by the que&s;tion it is meant to inquire, whether the well became affected with the Fever, in con&s;e|quence of the contact of a &s;ick per&s;on, or the cloath|ing of a &s;ick per&s;on, or from the performance of the offices of friend&s;hip, charity, and meniality, to tho&s;e who were &s;ick,&mdash;I an&s;wer that no &s;uch ca&s;es have come to my knowledge; whereas numerous in&s;tances of &s;uch contact fell under my ob&s;ervation, and have been related to me, to which no ill effects &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>A number of per&s;ons, not le&s;s than ten or twelve, removed, with the Fever on them, from New-York to Stamford, 40 miles; but no per&s;on in Stamford, be&s;ide them, ever had the di&s;order.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitch, the gentleman mentioned in the pre|ceding letter, attended the young men who had the di&s;ea&s;e with him, and to u&s;e his own words, <Q>lodged in the bed, warm with the effluvia of the body of the young man who died at his hou&s;e</Q>&mdash;and ne|verthele&s;s, he had no Fever.</P>
<P>Dr. Treat, according to the account of the Health-Committee, and of his phy&s;icians, died of the very wor&s;t degree of the Fever; yet he communicated it to nobody.</P>
<P>A patient of Dr. Dingley's, in Ferry-&s;treet, who was &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e, without any previous communication with any &s;ick per&s;on, and as early as the 17th of Augu&s;t, and who died with it, commu|nicated it to none of his attendants.

<P><PB REF="031169_0114_0feb12cbf5ef2100">The writer of &s;ome ingenious &s;trictures on Dr. Mitchill's Pamphlet, remarks, in a note &s;ubjoined to his fir&s;t paper, that he has, <Q>in common with many of <HI>his</HI> fellow-practitioners, indulged, <HI>without the &s;malle&s;t ill effect,</HI> a much more frequent intercour&s;e with <HI>his</HI> patients, in this di&s;ea&s;e, than u&s;ual,</Q> &amp;c.

<P>But there would be no end to an enumeration of &s;imilar facts; I &s;hall only add, therefore, that I made u&s;e of no precaution whatever, in re&s;pect to &s;uch com|munication with patients; that I have been, for more than two hours, &s;hut up in a &s;mall room, with a per|&s;on laboring under the wor&s;t &s;ymptoms of the Fever; have watched &s;everal nights, and performed the mo&s;t &s;ervile offices, with a near friend, who was &s;ick with it; and never &s;u&s;tained the lea&s;t inconvenience from &s;uch expo&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I might &s;uperadd to all this, the <HI>ambiguous</HI> te&s;timony of another Phy&s;ician, who, in proof of the uninfectious nature of the Fever, affirmed that he had <Q>had thirty patients with it, and had <HI>taken the breath of all of them.</HI></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, perhaps the advocates for the Contagious, or Infectious, nature of the di&s;ea&s;e under con&s;ideration, do not intend to confine the meaning of the term Con|tagion to that &s;ub&s;tance, whatever it is, which is ge|nerated in an unhealthy body, and by application to a &s;ound body, excites in it a &s;imilar unhealthine&s;s. They may mean to de&s;cribe, or de&s;ignate, by it, that &s;tructure, con&s;titution, or vice, of the atmo&s;phere, which di&s;po&s;es to, or excites di&s;ea&s;e.

about words. Perhaps, the following &s;tatement of my opinions, will lead us to the formation or attain|ment of &s;ome more accurate notions on this point.</P>
<P>Owing to a variety of cau&s;es, which have been enumerated in the cour&s;e of the&s;e letters, I &s;uppo&s;e the atmo&s;phere of New-York to have become vi|tiated, in 1795, to an uncommon degree: that there was either an unu&s;ual ab&s;ence of that principle nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport healthy life, or an extraordinary con|centration, diffu&s;ion, or quantity, of &s;ome other, un|friendly to healthy life. From the operation of one, or other, of the&s;e &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere, and of the cau&s;es above-mentioned, on the bodies of the re&s;idents in this city, I &s;uppo&s;e a predi&s;po&s;ition, greater or le&s;s, according to the &s;ituation and other circum&s;tances of individuals, was formed, in the citi|zens, generally, to the Fever which prevailed here that year. With &s;ome per&s;ons, this condition of the atmo&s;phere, of it&s;elf, might be &s;ufficient to produce in them di&s;ea&s;e. But, ordinarily, I believe, the aid of &s;ome cau&s;e, which &s;hould di&s;turb the regularity of the di&s;tributions, or functions, of the body, was re|quired to bring the &s;y&s;tem into a &s;tate of febrile ac|tion. Such, for in&s;tance, as intemperance in eating or drinking, &s;udden fright, fatigue, or indeed, any con&s;iderable irregularity in what Sy&s;tematics call the Non-Naturals.</P>
<P>This condition of the atmo&s;phere, I &s;uppo&s;e, ac|quired &s;trength, daily, as the &s;ea&s;on advanced; or, in other words, the power of the atmo&s;phere, &amp;c. to predi&s;po&s;e to the Fever, was increa&s;ed, as the &s;ea&s;on progre&s;&s;ed. I &s;ay to predi&s;po&s;e,&mdash;for I &s;u&s;pect it &s;el|dom, of it&s;elf, produced the di&s;ea&s;e, after that had at|tained its height, in tho&s;e who remained here con|&s;tantly.

Though, on per&s;ons coming into the city, from abroad, it doubtle&s;s operated with much greater force, in many ca&s;es, than on the citizens, at any time. This is ea&s;ily accounted for, from the known effects of cu&s;tom. For
<Q><L>The mon&s;ter Cu&s;tom, who doth, &amp;c.</L>
<L>&mdash;is angel yet in this.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tems of tho&s;e who continued here became habituated to the atmo&s;phere; and while tho&s;e who came here from the country, with ruddy faces, &s;unk down in death, the pale and yellow beings who &s;talked through our &s;treets, derided di&s;ea&s;e, and pur&s;ued their cu&s;tomary occupations.&mdash;But, to return from this di|gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Not only am I convinced of the accuracy of the preceding ideas, but I have no doubt that this vice of the atmo&s;phere was rendered &s;till greater by exhala|tions from the bodies of the &s;ick&mdash;It is a point well-e&s;tabli&s;hed in medicine, that the air of a room is rendered un&s;uitable for re&s;piration, if a num|ber of healthy per&s;ons are obliged to breathe it over &s;everal times, without the admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air from abroad. So injurious is &s;uch a confinement, in re|&s;pect to air, to the human body, that it has, in nume|rous in&s;tances, produced terrible febrile di&s;ea&s;es. And if &s;uch effects ari&s;e from the repeated breathing over the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, air, by healthy per&s;ons, we &s;hould naturally conclude, as is the fact, that &s;uch repeated re&s;piration (e&s;pecially when united with the con&s;tant exhalation from their bodies) by the &s;ick, mu&s;t be &s;till more pernicious to health.&mdash;You will pardon me for the introduction of remarks &s;o trite and familiar, for the &s;ake of the u&s;e I wi&s;h to make of them; which is no other than this&mdash;I have mention|ed
<PB N="113" REF="031169_0117_0feb12d592787848">
it as my belief that the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere was &s;uch, in this city, the la&s;t year, as, in conjunction with the general influence of the cau&s;es producing that &s;tate, to predi&s;po&s;e to, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, pro|duce, the Fever; and that this ill-conditioned atmo&s;|phere was rendered &s;till more noxious by means of the numbers who became &s;ick, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on; and to this I would add, for the rea&s;ons con|tained in the remarks above, that I think it not im|probable that &s;ome were affected with the Fever, in con&s;equence of the further vitiation of the atmo&s;phere by the &s;ick, who, without that circum&s;tance, would have remained free from di&s;ea&s;e. So, likewi&s;e, there may be per&s;ons, the balance of who&s;e health is &s;o tre|mulou&s;ly &s;en&s;ible to every external influence, as to preponderate to the &s;ide of di&s;ea&s;e, on the &s;lighte&s;t impul&s;e of its cau&s;es. With &s;uch, the mere contact of a &s;ick per&s;on, or a tran&s;itory expo&s;ure to the efflu|via ari&s;ing from a &s;ick body, may be &s;ufficient to pro|duce Fever; and in&s;tances of this kind may have hap|pened, in the cour&s;e of the Fever in que&s;tion.

<P><PB N="114" REF="031169_0118_0feb12d735c46780">To conclude,&mdash;If, in &s;peaking of the Fever of 1795, the epithet Contagious is meant to expre&s;s that it was communicated by contact, &amp;c. like the Small|pox, Meazles and Plague, I mu&s;t repeat it, I find no good rea&s;on for admitting this to have been the fact; but, for the rea&s;ons before alledged, I think there is ju&s;t ground for a belief that the Fever was never ex|cited in this way.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER EIGHTH.</HI> Some Account of the Symptoms of the Fever of <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER the frequent confe&s;&s;ions, which occur in the preceding letters, of the circum&s;cribed &s;phere of my ob&s;ervation, it were pre&s;umptuous in me to pre|tend to deliver a regular hi&s;tory of the &s;ymptoms of the Fever of 1795. You will ob&s;erve, from the ac|count which I &s;hall tran&s;mit to you, that the appear|ances it exhibited were too various to authorize &s;uch an attempt in any one who had not opportunity to ex|amine them, in relation to numbers of the &s;ick. It is proper, therefore, that I warn you, once more, to con&s;ider what is here delivered as the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervation only&mdash;except where it is expre&s;sly mentioned to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Fever of 1795 was, generally, &s;udden in its acce&s;s; &s;o much &s;o, in &s;ome in&s;tances, as to re&s;emble convul&s;ions. In a le&s;s number of ca&s;es, it came on gradually, and after a &s;lowly-increa&s;ing illne&s;s of &s;everal days. It began with great pain of the head, heat and redne&s;s of the face, and fullne&s;s and redne&s;s of the eyes, accompanied by a &s;trong, full, ten&s;e, pul&s;e, and an almo&s;t univer&s;al co&s;tivene&s;s. Pains in the back and limbs were common; but not as much &s;o as of the head. A great inquietude, or anxiety, of the &s;tomach and brea&s;t, was common; approaching, &s;ometimes, to &s;yncope, and &s;ometimes a vomiting, which &s;oon cea&s;ed, or continued, at in|tervals, through the di&s;order.&mdash;The Fever which now commenced was rarely u&s;hered in by a chill, and con|tinued
<PB REF="031169_0120_0feb12dcd082d268">
for a greater or le&s;&s;er period, according to circum&s;tances, with &s;o many varieties and combina|tions of &s;ymptoms, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue a regular de&s;cription. I &s;hall, therefore, di&s;po&s;e my remarks under &s;everal heads; pre&s;erving as much connection as circum&s;tances will permit.</P>
<P N="1">I. Though the <HI>pul&s;e</HI> was generally full, &s;trong, and ten&s;e, in the beginning of the Fever, it was not always &s;o. It was &s;ometimes weak and low, but &s;till ten&s;e&mdash;if it be proper to u&s;e this term, to point out a condition of the pul&s;e, as it appears to me, wholly peculiar to this Fever. I well remember that, in a youth of 12, or 13, years of age, the pul&s;e became much fuller after a plentiful bleeding; though he was of a feeble con&s;titution, and had been &s;lightly affected with the Fever once before.&mdash;In two gentlemen, who were con&s;iderably affected by the Fever, for &s;everal weeks, but not to &s;uch a degree as to be confined to their beds, this peculiar pul&s;e was very di&s;tingui&s;hable; as much &s;o, I think, as in any other per&s;ons who&s;e pul&s;e I examined.</P>
<P>Hemorrhages, from various parts of the body, were frequent, e&s;pecially in the advanced &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, and where it had been violent from the fir&s;t. The&s;e were from the no&s;e, fauces, e&s;pecially the gums, from punctures made in bloodletting, and from the &s;tomach: I &s;aw no other. Bleeding from the no&s;e and fauces often occurred in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, and was removable by the general reme|dies. Bleedings from the punctures made in blood|letting, were &s;een in the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and were re&s;trained with the greate&s;t difficulty. I recollect to have been con&s;tantly engaged in an attempt to re|&s;train &s;uch a hemorrhage, in company with another phy&s;ician, two of the mo&s;t melancholy hours I ever
<PB REF="031169_0121_0feb12e0ca6719e8">
experienced. Hemorrhagy from the &s;tomach I &s;hall mention more particularly hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">II. Symptoms of pulmonic affection were not un|common; though I do not recollect to have ob&s;erved them till the la&s;t of September, or beginning of Oc|tober. They &s;ometimes ro&s;e nearly to the height of pneumonia.</P>
<P>Hiccough was a trouble&s;ome &s;ymptom, and often accompanied vomiting; and there was &s;ometimes, as it appeared to me, a mingled hiccoughing and belch|ing.</P>
<P N="3">III. The marks of conge&s;tion in the brain were too numerous and unequivocal to be mi&s;taken.&mdash;A vio|lent pain in the head was one of the earlie&s;t, mo&s;t con&s;tant, and mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, &s;ymptoms of this di&s;|ea&s;e&mdash;Coma was a very frequent &s;ymptom; and, as I thought, in proportion to the &s;everity of the di&s;or|der. Towards the clo&s;e, it amounted almo&s;t to total &s;tupefaction; it being &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to rou&s;e the patient. Some degree of delirium was common; par|ticularly at the commencement of an exacerbation of the Fever; manife&s;ting it&s;elf in the hurried manner in which the patient performed any action, and in the rambling manner in which he conver&s;ed. That kind of delirium which &s;ome have called <HI>light-headedne&s;s,</HI> was remarkably pre&s;ent, in one per&s;on, at the clo&s;e of his di&s;order. He often &s;tarted up, wildly, without any apparent object, then lay down, and commenced &s;inging, in an interrupted, incoherent manner; but without any violence. And the day before his death, he continued to &s;ing, with &s;light intervals, more than an hour.&mdash;At other times, he would fix on &s;ome par|ticular words, and repeat them over and over; &s;ome|times, with no appearance of emotion; at others,
<PB REF="031169_0122_0feb12e26d72cbd0">
with &s;ome glimmering of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;In another per&s;on, a patient of a phy&s;ician of my acquaintance, the affection of the brain was like that in Phrenitis. A bli&s;tering-pla&s;ter applied, if I remember accurately, for 24 hours, to the head, which had been &s;haven, excited no ve&s;&s;ication, and &s;carcely any redne&s;s, though twice the u&s;ual quantity of cantharides was incorporated, and the patient was of a delicate ha|bit. In this ca&s;e the affection of the brain took place on the third day, and the patient died on the fifth or &s;ixth.&mdash;On examination and di&s;&s;ection of the contents of the cranium, all the membranes, and the very &s;ub|&s;tance of the brain, were di&s;covered to be in a remark|able and uncommon &s;tate of inflammation.&mdash;I have been the more particular in relating this ca&s;e, as it &s;eems to contradict, in a degree, the ideas of Dr. Ru&s;h, p. 50, of his Hi&s;tory of the Philadelphia Fever: our &s;ea&s;on having been unu&s;ually <HI>wet.</HI></P>
<P>As connected with the &s;tate of the brain, it may be proper to mention here, that the <HI>eyes</HI> were often &s;uf|fu&s;ed, the whites of them tinged with yellow, and the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els turgid with blood. In &s;ome patients they had an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ingular wildne&s;s; while, in others, there was a remarkable vacuity, or ab&s;ence of expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I &s;aw no in&s;tance of &s;quinting; nor ob|&s;erved any uncommon &s;tate of the pupil: but I ought to acknowledge that my attention was not particularly directed to the condition of the eyes, in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the mind was very variable. Some were exceedingly impatient and ira&s;cible; others, a&s;toni&s;hingly ob&s;tinate; and this particularly, when, as was often the ca&s;e, there was a lo&s;s of memory, or &s;ome degree of mania. A &s;trong appeal to their good-&s;en&s;e, calling them by name, &s;eemed to effect a tem|porary re&s;toration of their docility and recollection,&mdash;
<PB REF="031169_0123_0feb12e566ea3438">
which were &s;oon lo&s;t.&mdash;Many were very confident, at fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing their illne&s;s not be the Fever; but gave them&s;elves up to de&s;pair, immediately on being convinced that it was the Fever. Many were full of dreadful apprehen&s;ions, from the fir&s;t; and often|times, exceedingly aggravated what would have been, otherwi&s;e, a &s;light di&s;ea&s;e. A few, were calm, col|lected, undaunted, throughout their &s;ickne&s;s. And here it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to remark, that the&s;e &s;ame varieties were, in a degree, ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e who continued well. Some phy&s;icians thought they could di&s;cern a tendency, among the citizens, gene|rally, to mania. It is certain that fear was a terrible evil, and frequently proved the exciting cau&s;e of the Fever.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I have remarked that a great anxiety at the <HI>&s;to|mach</HI> was &s;ometimes felt, on the patient's being fir&s;t &s;eiz|ed with the Fever. This anxiety, it may now be added, in &s;ome ca&s;es, extended through the complaint; but was mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing when the Fever was mo&s;t violent. A great &s;en&s;e of &s;orene&s;s was often complained of, when any thing was taken into the &s;tomach, <HI>as if it were raw;</HI>&mdash;to u&s;e the words of one in whom it was ob|&s;erved. In &s;ome, the &s;en&s;ibility of this organ was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to make it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to admini&s;ter, either food or medicine, by the mouth.</P>
<P>Patients were often afflicted with extreme pain in the bowels; but more re&s;embling that in dy&s;entery, than in cholic. A di&s;charge, generally, afforded a pre&s;ent relief.</P>
<P>Flatulency, both of the &s;tomach and bowels, was almo&s;t univer&s;al, and to an extraordinary degree.&mdash; The abdomen was &s;ometimes di&s;tended with wind;
<PB N="119" REF="031169_0124_0feb12e883516938">
but the di&s;ten&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided after a conderable di&s;|charge of wind, downwards. This was often the ca&s;e in one of my patients.</P>
<P>Several di&s;&s;ections, as I am informed by the gen|tleman principally concerned in them, &s;hew the &s;to|mach to have been in a remarkable &s;tate of inflamma|tion and excoriation. It appears to me that this di&s;|ea&s;e of the &s;tomach, or inflammation&mdash;(if it be pro|per to call it &s;o) extended through the whole length of the Alimentary Canal; as it is known to do in Apthae and &s;ome other di&s;orders; for one ca&s;e of excoriation and partial mortification of the Rectum came within my knowlege, and I have heard of &s;everal others.</P>
<P>I have mentioned, above, that Co&s;tivene&s;s was al|mo&s;t univer&s;al at the commencement of the Fever; but it was not always pre&s;ent. For though it was ob&s;ervable in the greater number of patients, &s;o much &s;o as to de&s;erve to be ranked among the cha|racteri&s;tic &s;igns of the di&s;ea&s;e; and though a con&s;tant tendency to a co&s;tive &s;tate, was general in tho&s;e &s;ick with the di&s;order; yet, in &s;ome, the Fever was at|tended from the fir&s;t, or for a while, by a Diarrhea; and in one in&s;tance, the whole of the Di&s;ea&s;e ap|peared to me to be turned upon the bowels, and to be converted into, or a&s;&s;ume the form of a Diar|rhea.</P>
<P>Some were &s;eized with vomiting at the fir&s;t, which was &s;oon &s;topped, or cea&s;ed &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and ne|ver returned. One ca&s;e of this kind, proved favora|ble&mdash;the patient recovering; another unfavorable, the patient dying.&mdash;In others, vomiting commenced the di&s;ea&s;e, and continued through it: while in others, again, it came on in the cour&s;e, or at the
<PB REF="031169_0125_0feb12ec725d3040">
clo&s;e of the di&s;order; and this both in &s;ucce&s;sful and un&s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">V. The matters vomited up varied in colour and con&s;i&s;tence, in different per&s;ons, and in different pe|riods of the di&s;ea&s;e. The mo&s;t common was of a yellowi&s;h, greeni&s;h, or a muddy green and yellow, appearance, and very fluid. Vomitings of this kind, were &s;een both in tho&s;e who recovered, and who died; and were both temporary and continued.&mdash; Next, in frequency, was that of a blacki&s;h appearance, commonly de&s;cribed as re&s;embling coffee-grounds, but bearing a nearer re&s;emblance to blood partly burnt, and diluted with muddy water. Several who had this vomiting recovered.&mdash;I never &s;aw an in&s;tance of that tar-like vomit, which has been noticed by &s;ome writers. But, of all others, that which &s;truck me as evidential of the greate&s;t derangement of the &s;tomach, was the vomiting up of, what appeared to be, thin blood, in which floated a flaky, filmy &s;ub|&s;tance, which I &s;uppo&s;e to have been the villous coat of the &s;tomach.&mdash;This I &s;aw but in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, a few hours before death.

<P>I cannot help thinking that the matters vomited up, except it be tho&s;e of the yellowi&s;h or greeni&s;h ca&s;t, have all a portion of blood mingled with them; and that their various appearances depend&mdash;a&s;ide from their mixture with the contents of the &s;to|mach&mdash;in great mea&s;ure, on the quantity of blood mingled with them. It appears to me that, in this di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ecretion of the Bile is greatly affected; and that, in many in&s;tances, the blood it&s;elf pa&s;&s;es into the biliary ve&s;&s;els, charged with the Bile, de|&s;igned to have been &s;eparated, and being poured in|to

<P>The di&s;charges from the bowels were very dark, in general, even where no preparation of mercury was u&s;ed. They were, likewi&s;e, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, re|markably fluid, where the bowels had been once.

But I have &s;een &s;tools of this colour, in other di&s;|ea&s;es&mdash;particularly once in the Croup&mdash;where calo|mel was frequently u&s;ed as a purge.&mdash;I mention this, as it may &s;ometimes happen, that phy&s;icians deceive them&s;elves, in &s;uch ca&s;es, a&s;cribing that to the di&s;or|der, which depends on medicines.</P>
<P>Some were troubled, with a retention of urine; but, more generally, with an unu&s;ual flow; and this in one in&s;tance, I di&s;tinctly recollect, where the quan|tity of fluids taken into the body, was very &s;mall.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to &s;weating, I di&s;covered nothing uni|form. In one ca&s;e, the patient always had a profu&s;e, clammy, &s;weat, when he fell into a re&s;tle&s;s &s;leep, with a ri&s;e of fever. This was often ob&s;ervable, likewi&s;e, in that &s;tate of remarkable anxiety which frequently preceded an evacuation by &s;tool.</P>
<P>Blood drawn in this Fever, was remarkably want|ing in floridity; and this was e&s;pecially true of that which was evacuated in the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash; whether by art, or &s;pontaneous effu&s;ion.

<P>There was great variety in mu&s;cular power, in dif|ferent per&s;ons. A man who died with the very wor&s;t &s;ymptoms of the Fever, the evening before his death, ro&s;e from his bed, ran down two flights of &s;tairs, re|turned, and was only prevented from going down a &s;econd time by his nur&s;e's having locked him in his chamber.&mdash;In another ca&s;e, where the di&s;ea&s;e was mild, the patient felt perfectly ea&s;y and compo&s;ed, and in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mental and corporeal &s;trength, while he lay on his bed; but, when he ro&s;e, and at|tempted to walk, a &s;en&s;e of univer&s;al anxiety was felt, his ideas became confu&s;ed, his &s;trength &s;eemed to de|&s;ert him, a &s;udden faintne&s;s came over him, and twice he &s;unk down, unable to proceed.</P>
<P>An evacuation, by &s;tool, often &s;uddenly re&s;tored the patient, who was lifted from bed, to &s;uch a degree of &s;trength, that he continued for &s;ome time after, to walk about the room, or &s;it up.</P>

<P>The ta&s;te was either exceedingly impaired, or very fickle. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the appetite. When the appetite began to return, and food to be reli&s;hed,

I have &s;een Porter de&s;ired; but it was not often reli&s;hed, when allowed. The &s;ame is true of coffee. Water was, univer&s;ally, the mo&s;t agreeable drink; and I allowed its free u&s;e. One of my patients fre|quently drank, in one night, when very feveri&s;h and re&s;tle&s;s, three quarts of water. The appearance of the <HI>tongue</HI> varied, according to the violence and du|ration of the di&s;ea&s;e, from white, to yellow, darki&s;h, and black, like burnt blood; and the gums often a&s;|&s;umed this la&s;t appearance, when there had been bleeding from them.</P>
<P>An a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;en&s;ibility to cold was nearly univer&s;al.&mdash;I remember, in one of tho&s;e cold turns which we had in September, a remark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le in&s;tance of this. One of my patients occupied a chamber in the &s;econd &s;tory: the room was very large, extending the whole width of the hou&s;e, and having a chimney, a large door, and two windows at either end. The bed was hard, in the middle of the room, the door and all the windows open, and he covered with a &s;ingle &s;heet, frequently thrown off in his re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, yet he complained of no cold, while I was chilled through, though &s;heltered from the draught of air, with my u&s;ual cloaths on, and the addition of a &s;ur|tout and double cloak.</P>

<P>IT was obvious, to the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;ervation, that the mildne&s;s, or &s;everity, of the Fever of 1795, de|pended, in no &s;mall degree, on the &s;ituation of the

patient. That tho&s;e who lived in the higher, drier, cleaner, and more airy parts of the town, were more lightly affected; and that a removal, from the other quarters, into &s;uch as were &s;o circum&s;tanced, was al|ways followed by beneficial effects to the per&s;on re|moved. In con&s;equence, a milder treatment, in every re&s;pect, e&s;pecially a more &s;paring u&s;e of evacuations, was warrantable in &s;ome ca&s;es, than in others; and as &s;ome practitioners were chiefly employed among tho&s;e who&s;e favorable &s;ituations protected them from the mo&s;t malignant attacks of the di&s;ea&s;e, you will readily conceive why there &s;hould prevail, in the minds of &s;ome, an opinion that very active remedies were unnece&s;&s;ary, and a recurrence to the lancet in|expedient, at lea&s;t, if not pernicious. It is true that I did not always u&s;e it my&s;elf; but it is al&s;o true, that I never failed to regret the omi&s;&s;ion. And though I lo&s;t no patient by the neglect, yet I am convinced that, in every &s;uch ca&s;e, however &s;light the di&s;ea&s;e might appear, the cure was protracted. But, if the remedies were not always the &s;ame, the principle on which they were admini&s;tered, was uniform; and their operation the &s;ame in kind, if not in degree.&mdash; And, after the Fever became more general, and the &s;ea&s;on con&s;iderably advanced, there was but little choice left in the u&s;e of means.

<P>The effects of bleeding were, in every in&s;tance where I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving them, mo&s;t &s;alutary. The &s;ick &s;eldom failed of finding immedi|ate relief from it, and of perceiving that relief in|crea&s;ed as the blood continued to flow. It dimini&s;hed the pains in the head, brea&s;t, and &s;tomach: oppre&s;|&s;ion, anxiety, faintne&s;s, and heat, were moderated: the eyes rarely failed to a&s;&s;ume a clearer and more natural appearance: and it &s;eemed to communicate a new energy to the &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;I remember an in&s;tance where a patient was &s;o unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t him&s;elf, on the &s;econd day of the di&s;ea&s;e, that, when I wanted to bleed him, it required two per&s;ons to &s;upport him, in pa&s;&s;ing a few &s;teps from his bed, into the open air.&mdash; There, he was &s;eated and &s;upported in a chair. He grew ea&s;ier, in every re&s;pect, as the blood flowed.&mdash; After taking away about twenty ounces, and tying up his arm, he ro&s;e without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; walked &s;eve|ral rods, to a Nece&s;&s;ary; took care of him&s;elf; had a profu&s;e evacuation, by which he &s;eemed to gain addi|tional &s;trength; and returned to his bed, without any aid, and with a firm &s;tep.</P>
<P>Such were the immediate effects of bleeding early in the di&s;ea&s;e. The importance of this remedy was not dimini&s;hed by the duration of the di&s;order, nor
<PB REF="031169_0135_0feb13084f950768">
the nece&s;&s;ity for it le&s;&s;ened, while the &s;ymptoms con|tinued which made it u&s;eful in the commencement.&mdash; On the contrary, it was oftentimes as requi&s;ite, and as beneficial, the fifth and the &s;ixth days, as on the fir&s;t. But this nece&s;&s;ity for its u&s;e, at &s;o late a period, did not often occur, where it had been vigorou&s;ly em|ployed, in connection with other remedies, at the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e, which I &s;tate briefly, is one among numbers, in evidence of the advantage of early, free, and repeated bleeding.</P>
<P>A phy&s;ician was called to a young man, with all the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;as it generally appeared at the fir&s;t&mdash;in the evening. He bled him 16 or 18 ounces; directed purges, &amp;c. in the manner hereaf|ter to be mentioned; and though the weather was then cool, ordered the windows to be removed, both day and night. The &s;ymptoms were relieved; but the next morning it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the bleeding; which was done, to an equal quantity. The purges, &amp;c. were al&s;o continued. In the even|ing, a third bleeding was performed, and a like quan|tity of blood was taken away; and the other reme|dies were continued. On the ninth day, from the &s;eizure, the man was well, and able to pur&s;ue his bu|&s;ine&s;s; though his &s;trength was not perfectly re&s;|tored.</P>
<P>In one in&s;tance which came to my knowledge, bleeding removed an ob&s;tinate vomiting, of many days continuance, which threatened the life of the pa|tient, and which had re&s;i&s;ted all other remedies.</P>
<P>It &s;eems hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add any thing more, in favor of this remedy, after its beneficial effects have
<PB REF="031169_0136_0feb130b66161f40">
been &s;tated, with &s;o much eloquence and per&s;picuity, by Dr. Ru&s;h, in his various publications, re&s;pecting the Yellow Fever.</P>
<P N="2">II. PURGING. No ca&s;e occurred, in my particular practice, where, notwith&s;tanding the vomiting, ca|thartics could not be admini&s;tered. When this &s;ymp|tom was very trouble&s;ome, they were required to be given in a &s;olid form, at more considerable intervals, and of as &s;mall a &s;ize as po&s;&s;ible. The activity of the purge was always to be proportioned to the vio|lence of the &s;ymptoms; and it was important that all medicines of this kind &s;hould be given in divided do&s;es&mdash;&s;o as to promote a gradual and continued di&s;|charge.&mdash;The operation was often very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by cly&s;ters; for which water alone was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The good effects of cathartics were not le&s;s obvi|ous than tho&s;e of venae&s;ection. They were indicated by the con&s;tipation, &s;o generally pre&s;ent; by pain in the bowels, flatulency, and tumefaction of the abdo|men; by pains of the head, heat and flu&s;hings of the face, and of the whole body; and finally, by the vo|mitings: and all the&s;e &s;ymptoms they rarely failed to obviate, or relieve. This relief, too, was oftentimes &s;o &s;udden, as to &s;eem like enchantment.&mdash;Frequently have I &s;een a patient, after an hour or more of &s;evere pain, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, heat, thir&s;t, and inquietude of every kind&mdash;feeble, exhau&s;ted, and as it were, ready to ex|pire&mdash;ri&s;e with the greate&s;t difficulty, and with the aid of others, to the chair, and after his evacuation, feel his pains removed, his heat and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s va|ni&s;hed, his &s;trength renewed, and him&s;elf able to fit up, or walk about, and breathe the air with freedom: and &s;ometimes, the di&s;charge was followed by a re|fre&s;hing &s;leep, and gentle per&s;piration.</P>
<P><PB REF="031169_0137_0feb130f590e17d0">The&s;e benefits were neither &s;o certainly, nor &s;o fre|quently, obtained, where the evacuations were violent and &s;udden. Indeed, it appears que&s;tionable to me, whether it be ever proper to excite &s;uch discharges, in Fevers. Patients, when much reduced, are apt to &s;ink under &s;uch immediate and abundant evacua|tions.</P>
<P N="3">III. COOL AIR.&mdash;It was of the utmo&s;t importance to procure a con&s;tant application of cool air to the body of the patient, from the commencement of the Fever. The advantages which re&s;ulted, were univer|&s;al and wonderful.&mdash;To this end, the &s;ick were or|dered to be placed on a hard bed, with very little covering, in the middle of the room; and the doors and windows were, as much as po&s;&s;ible, kept open day and night.&mdash;The good effects of this practice were exceedingly increa&s;ed, where the application of the cool air could be made to the patient in an erect po&s;ture. For, not only was it more equable, but the head was al&s;o relieved, thereby, from that &s;en&s;e of fullne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion which was invariably experi|enced in a recumbent po&s;ture. The &s;ick, therefore, were directed to &s;it up, in the cour&s;e of the day, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their attendants, as long as their &s;trength would permit, without their becoming ex|hau&s;ted. While in this &s;ituation, their feet and legs were covered more warmly than any other part of the body: and if cloths, dipped in cold water, or vinegar, were often applied to the temples, the relief obtained was &s;till greater.</P>
<P N="4">IV. COOL DRINKS.&mdash;The great thir&s;t, which was nearly univer&s;al in this Fever, from the fir&s;t, made the drinks, of nece&s;&s;ity, an article of early attention. It was ob&s;ervable that they never could be <HI>too cold.</HI> Pa|tients
<PB N="134" REF="031169_0138_0feb1310fb39d5b0">
complained of the warmth of water which had been &s;tanding but a &s;hort time; and &s;eemed to langui&s;h for a &s;upply of fre&s;h water, with an anxiety which became truly painful, when the u&s;ual hour of its di&s;tribution approached.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The water which is u&s;ed for drinking, in this city, is mo&s;tly drawn from a &s;ingle pump, called the Tea-Water Pump; and it is di&s;tributed, by means of large ca&s;ks, which are carted to every part of the town; once a day, in winter; and every morning and afternoon, in &s;ummer.</NOTE></P>
<P>The good effects of a plentiful u&s;e of cool, dilut|ing drinks, were obvious. They tempered the pre|ternatural heat and anxiety of the &s;tomach; often re|&s;trained vomiting, and the faucial hemorrhage; &s;erv|ed to dilute, and carry off, the offen&s;ive contents of the inte&s;tines; and di&s;po&s;ed to a more equable and aqueous &s;weat.&mdash;Of all other drinks, Water was mo&s;t reli&s;hed&mdash;and on many accounts, was the mo&s;t pro|per. A plea&s;ant and &s;uitable drink was made, by pouring warm water on fre&s;h apples, and &s;uffering it to cool; and likewi&s;e, by the addition of a piece of toa&s;ted bread to water. Milk, much diluted with water, was reli&s;hed by &s;ome; &s;ome were fond of but|ter-milk; and as all the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed bland and nutriti|ous, qualities, they were advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed, where a variety of drinks was required by the capricious ta&s;te of the patient.</P>
<P>I had no opportunity of trying the effiacy of ICE, but the te&s;timony of a Phy&s;ician, in whole judgement and veracity I place great confidence, is &s;trongly in its favor, and inclines me to believe that it may be u&s;ed with high expectations of advantage. Under his direction, it an&s;wered, better than any thing el&s;e, in relieving heat and fever; re&s;training hemorrhagy;
<PB N="135" REF="031169_0139_0feb13141d9c69f0">
and obviating, partially, or entirely, the vomiting&mdash; even the <HI>black vomiting.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. CLEANLINESS.&mdash;This is of the utmo&s;t impor|tance, and, in a mea&s;ure, indi&s;pen&s;able.&mdash;The bed and body linen &s;hould be often changed; the cloaths nece&s;&s;ary about the bed, well aired, &s;everal times a day: there &s;hould be two beds, one of which may be aired, while the other is in u&s;e: all unne|ce&s;&s;ary furniture&mdash;particularly woollen, &s;ilk and cot|ton&mdash;every thing which may ab&s;orb and retain efflu|via and moi&s;ture&mdash;&s;hould be removed: all uten&s;ils employed about the patient, frequently changed and rin&s;ed: the room &s;hould be often &s;prinkled and du&s;ted: the face, mouth, eyes whole head, hands&mdash; and, where it can be done, body of the patient, wa&s;hed with <HI>cool</HI> water, &s;everal times in the day. The more exactly&mdash;other circum&s;tances being regarded&mdash;the&s;e directions can be put in execution, the better for the patient; and, as my own experience convinces me, the more certain and &s;peedy will be his recovery.&mdash; You will ob&s;erve that I &s;ay cool water; for I cannot believe that the &s;hock which would follow from the application of cold water to the body, would be be|neficial.&mdash;It is not here, as in the u&s;e of air; for water is &s;o much more perfect a conductor of heat, that the ab&s;traction would be univer&s;al and &s;udden, were it applied cold. And, be&s;ide, as much is effected per|haps, by the ablution, as by the coldne&s;s, con&s;equent upon bathing.</P>
<P>It was not in my power, in any ca&s;e, to carry this practice to the extent I wi&s;hed; but, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> the relief of the patient was proportioned to the de|gree in which it was pur&s;ued.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="136" REF="031169_0140_0feb1317028979a0">VI. BLISTERS.&mdash;The advantages u&s;ually derived from the u&s;e of bli&s;ters, were not evident. It was &s;ometimes doubtful whether they were any way &s;erviceable. Yet there were in&s;tances in which they afforded relief; though mo&s;tly temporarily.&mdash; I have &s;een them, applied to the brea&s;t, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ion at the lungs; and applied to the back of the neck, relieve the head: in both ca&s;es, when the di&s;ea&s;e had been of &s;ome days continuance. A phy&s;ician, to whom I mentioned the&s;e remarks, in|formed me that his experience ju&s;tified them, except when, as was often ob&s;erved by him, a hemorrhage en&s;ued from the ve&s;ication, and continued for &s;ome days. Perhaps it was nece&s;&s;ary to the efficacy of bli&s;|ters, that they &s;hould have been, always, preceded by copious blood-letting.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The <HI>Tinctura Sacra,</HI> given in &s;mall quantities, at intervals, in water, was found by one Phy&s;ician, to have the happie&s;t effects, in relieving nau&s;ea, and obviating the tendency to vomit, in all ca&s;es where a de&s;truction of the coats of the &s;tomach had not taken place. The &s;ame gentleman derived much advantage over the di&s;ea&s;e, where, from long-continued vo|miting and effort to vomit, the &s;tomach appeared to have &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable injury, or abra&s;ion, from the u&s;e of <HI>Ol. Oliv. vel amygdal. dulc.</HI>&mdash;The oil co|vered the inflamed, or abraded, part, and protected it from mechanical &s;timulus, while it allayed the &s;orene&s;s and irritation produced by the action of the di&s;ea&s;ed fluids it contained.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. FOOD.&mdash;I have before remarked that the &s;ick &s;hewed no preference for animal food; on the con|trary, they very generally refu&s;ed it. Some, who reque&s;ted it to be prepared for them, found them&s;elves
<PB REF="031169_0141_0feb1319df84a638">
unable to eat it, when pre&s;ented to them.&mdash;Fruits, milk, bi&s;cuit boiled in milk or water, &s;ago, &s;alep, ha&s;ty-pudding, and vegetable food, generally, were mo&s;t reli&s;hed by them, both during their illne&s;s and their convale&s;cence.&mdash;This was peculiarly fortunate, as any indulgence in a contrary cour&s;e, was &s;ure to be followed by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing effects. The more rigidly attentive patients were to pre&s;erving a &s;implicity of diet, the more certain and plea&s;ant was their recovery. And, in all ca&s;es that I had opportunity to ob&s;erve, their convale&s;cence was always extended or &s;hortened, tedious or &s;atisfactory, in proportion as they returned &s;uddenly to the u&s;e of meats and &s;timulating drinks, or adhered to vegetable food and water.</P>
<P>I have now, my dear friend, made you acquainted with that cour&s;e which I generally pur&s;ued, in regard to tho&s;e who came under my care. The number was not great, nor the &s;ucce&s;s always complete&mdash;for I had not always the liberty of employing the means I wi&s;hed to, as fully and freely as was nece&s;&s;ary to com|plete &s;ucce&s;s. But, I can truly &s;ay, that I never &s;aw them do injury; and that they appeared to me to do good, in every ca&s;e, where they were employed, and in the proportion of their trial and application.&mdash; More than this no man can truly declare; more than this ought never to be expected from any remedies. The mo&s;t able practitioners are de&s;tined to &s;ee their patients frequently expire, in &s;pite of all their care, through the ob&s;tinacy of the patients them&s;elves, and the prejudices of their friends, the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of at|tendants, or the intervention of unfore&s;een and una|voidable accidents. The con&s;cio&s;une&s;s of having done their duty, of having acquitted them&s;elves, under cir|cum&s;tances
<PB REF="031169_0142_0feb131dd71560c8">
&s;o di&s;tre&s;sful and embara&s;&s;ing, to the be&s;t of their knowledge, and with purity of intention, will prove a never-failing con&s;olation, though the execra|tions of ignorance, and the calumnies of hatred, may pur&s;ue and per&s;ecute them.&mdash;Happy,&mdash;at lea&s;t in this re&s;pect,&mdash;are tho&s;e, <HI>"the peaceful tenor of who&s;e way,"</HI> while it excites neither oppo&s;ition nor malice, and neither elevates to opulence nor fame, &s;ecures them from mi&s;repre&s;entation and inju&s;tice.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER TENTH.</HI> Mi&s;cellaneous remarks on Medicines u&s;ed as Remedies in the Fever, and general conclu&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>YOU wi&s;h to obtain every po&s;&s;ible information, re&s;pecting the Fever of 1795; you are not &s;atisfied with knowing what remedies I employed, nor which were mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful; but you would learn all that were u&s;ed; the &s;ucce&s;s, or failure of each. I ap|plaud your curio&s;ity, my friend, for I am not ignorant of the benevolent motives which excite it; but I fear that there is little with which it is in my power fur|ther to gratify it. The practice which I &s;aw, was that which I have recommended: other remedies I know were u&s;ed; but, not having had opportunity, but in few in&s;tances, to mark their effects, I ought not, from my own convictions, how well-founded &s;oever they may appear to me, precipitately to con|demn either the pre&s;criptions, or their authors. In the variety of ca&s;es, con&s;titutions, and circum&s;tances, it might happen that &s;ome of tho&s;e very things, which
<PB REF="031169_0143_0feb131f9018ed08">
appeared pernicious when I &s;aw them u&s;ed, were &s;ometimes proper and &s;alutary. It would be pre|&s;umptuous, therefore, in me, to decide without more information; but I may be allowed an opinion; and that opinion need not be with-held from a friend.&mdash;I confe&s;s, then, that from the &s;ucce&s;s which attended the antiphlogi&s;tic plan of cure, I am per&s;uaded that no other can be &s;alutary, or &s;afe; and the few in|&s;tances in which the effects of a different mode of treating the Fever were ob&s;erved by me, &s;trengthened my previous convictions of its inutility and dan|ger.</P>
<P>The medicines chiefly tru&s;ted to, by tho&s;e who pur&s;ued a different cour&s;e from that laid down in the preceding letter, were, as I am informed, Calomel, to promote, or effect a Salivation,&mdash;Bark&mdash;Lauda|num&mdash;Wine, and other &s;timulating drinks&mdash;with an Animal diet.</P>
<P>Of the effects of Salivation, not having &s;een it take place, by nature nor art, in the Fever of 1795, I can &s;ay nothing. Dr. Ru&s;h countenances the practice, in his Treati&s;e on the Fever of Philadelphia, and adds the te&s;timony of many re&s;pectable authorities to his own.&mdash;As a Cathartic, Calomel, combined with other purgative &s;ub&s;tances, was unque&s;tionably u&s;e|ful. Some, I know, thought otherwi&s;e; and that other purgatives might be more &s;afely and efficaciou&s;|ly employed; and, I confe&s;s, I &s;aw &s;ome ca&s;es in which it appeared to affect the &s;tomach very painful|ly. But a Phy&s;ician on who&s;e judgment I have great reliance, informs me, that he &s;aw rea&s;on to re|ject a &s;imilar opinion, which he had ha&s;tily adopted; repeated ob&s;ervation having convinced him, that all the &s;ymptoms of ga&s;tric affection were wor&s;e in tho&s;e
<PB REF="031169_0144_0feb1322a8725308">
who had not been purged with Calomel, than in tho&s;e who had been evacuated by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I gave Bark, in no form, but in three ca&s;es. Two were in the early part of the reign of the Fever, the two fir&s;t patients that I had; and I am convinced it retarded the cure in both. In the other in&s;tance, it was admini&s;tered after the Fever had left the Patient, and he was convale&s;cent. Here it was given as any other Bitter, and as much in compliance with his opinions, as from any expectation of its doing good; and, as far as I can judge, with very little effect of any kind.&mdash;In the following ca&s;e, its exhibition was not &s;o harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>A medical friend was called to vi&s;it the patient of another Phy&s;ician, who had quitted town, on account of his health. The &s;ick man was oppre&s;t by the mo&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms; of the number of which, were hemorrhagy and the black vomit. The &s;timu|lating &s;y&s;tem had been &s;teadily pur&s;ued, and was con|tinued, under the direction of a pupil of the phy&s;ician fir&s;t employed. In particular, large quantities of Bark were exhibited, throughout the day.&mdash;On the entrance of the &s;econd phy&s;ician, the Bark and all other medicines of the kind, were laid a&s;ide; cool air was freely admitted; and the antiphlogi&s;tic plan of cure &s;trictly adhered to. The con&s;equence was, that all the &s;ymptoms were relieved, and a pro&s;pect opened on the patient of a recovery. The vomiting and hemorrhagy had totally cea&s;ed. In this &s;itua|tion, and while the Phy&s;ician was attending to &s;ome per&s;ons who&s;e condition was more alarming, the per&s;on who had the immediate charge of the &s;ick man, began, again, to admini&s;ter the Bark.&mdash;The next day &mdash;or the very &s;ame, at night&mdash;all the bad &s;ymptoms
<PB REF="031169_0145_0feb13269d982c00">
recurred; the Bark was, neverthele&s;s, per&s;i&s;ted in; and the man died.</P>
<P>Several &s;imilar ca&s;es have been reported to me; but none &s;o minutely as to authorize an attempt to &s;tate them to you.</P>
<P>The extreme re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of a patient, in whom I had the &s;tronge&s;t intere&s;t, and for who&s;e fate the deepe&s;t anxiety, induced me, in violation of my more &s;ober judgement, to admini&s;ter Laudanum.&mdash; This I did not do, till he had &s;pent three nearly &s;leep|le&s;s nights.&mdash;In every in&s;tance, it undoubtedly, in|crea&s;ed the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, clammy &s;weats, thir&s;t and Fever. I was obliged to di&s;continue it.</P>
<P>Wine, brandy and water, and e&s;pecially porter, when taken by any of my patients, had the mo&s;t per|nicious effects. I had occa&s;ion to &s;ee an acce&s;s of Fever, repeatedly brought on by the one, and a re|lap&s;e by the other; where they were u&s;ed without my knowlege, and contrary to my direction.</P>
<P>Of the effects of Animal Diet, I have already &s;poken, and have nothing new to add.</P>
<P>On the whole, it appears inconte&s;tible to me, that what is called the antiphlogi&s;tic treatment is to be adopted in Fevers like that which prevailed in New-York, in 1795, in all its &s;trictne&s;s, and adhered to with pertinacious re&s;olution. Both the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the &s;ucce&s;s attendant on the practice recommended, concur in e&s;tabli&s;hing the propriety of employing it.&mdash;It is al&s;o to be remembered that, in this di&s;ea&s;e, not a moment is to be lo&s;t: a day, an hour, nay almo&s;t an in&s;tant of delay, may &s;ometimes be fatal; and the means practi&s;ed mu&s;t be powerful in proportion to the violence of the &s;ymptoms. Nei|ther
<PB REF="031169_0146_0feb132844222aa0">
mu&s;t we be deceived by the apparent mildne&s;s of the &s;eizure&mdash;for a few hours may entirely change the face of things, and we may be left to lament that credulity which led us to temporize, and prevented the u&s;e of tho&s;e remedies, which delay alone rendered ineffectual.</P>
<P>But, while the Phy&s;ician &s;trenuou&s;ly directs his ef|forts to the removal of the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e, let him not overlook a pa&s;&s;ion which never fails to aggravate them. <HI>Fear,</HI> the exciting cau&s;e, in many in|&s;tances, of the Fever; the fomenter of all its evils; and &s;ometimes, as it were, the &s;ole di&s;ea&s;e; is a fre|quent and dreadful calamity, and one of the dire&s;t adver&s;aries with which medicine has to contend.&mdash;In numerous in&s;tances, during the continuance of the Fever of 1795, apprehen&s;ion touched upon in&s;anity; de&s;troying all confidence in the Phy&s;ician and in re|medies, or exciting an ab&s;urd and enthu&s;ia&s;tic reliance on pretenders and madmen: and utterly di&s;qualfying the patient for a proper attention to him&s;elf.&mdash;In the well, the evil was &s;carcely le&s;s. The name, alone, of Yellow Fever, &s;eemed &s;ufficient to induce di&s;ea&s;e, to bani&s;h di&s;cretion, to &s;ever the bonds of &s;ocial connec|tion, rend a&s;under the ties of parental, filial, and con|nubial affection, and put rea&s;on to flight.&mdash;It was in vain to point out the folly of this terror; to declare the di&s;ea&s;e not infectious, and ea&s;y of prevention; to offer mathematical demon&s;tration that other di&s;orders were often more mortal, without exciting any alarm; it was &s;till the Yellow Fever, and that was an irre&s;i|&s;table reply to every argument.&mdash;The city of New-Haven, &s;ummer before la&s;t, lo&s;t about 50 of its inha|bitants, with the Yellow Fever. Univer&s;al con&s;ter|nation prevailed throughout the place; all bu&s;ine&s;s was at an end; and mo&s;t of the principal inhabitants fled.&mdash;La&s;t &s;ummer, the Dy&s;entery raged there: more
<PB REF="031169_0147_0feb132b10408d90">
than 70 per&s;ons died of it: but nobody fled; nobody was frightened; and the Magi&s;trates, very gravely, put a &s;top to all communication with New-York, for fear of the Yellow Fever; made ve&s;&s;els ride qua|rantine, and confined &s;tage-coach pa&s;&s;engers, that no contagion might be diffu&s;ed, through the city, from their trunks and their garments.&mdash;But, it is time to put an end to this &s;eries of letters; and &s;eek, by no|velty, to give new intere&s;t to our corre&s;pondence. I &s;hall take my leave of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, with an enumeration of the inferences I have drawn from having viewed it, in the light here exhibited to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Fever of 1795 was Endemic:&mdash;i. e. gene|rated by local cau&s;es, producing a Fever every year, in this city.</P>
<P N="2">2. The peculiar ferocity of the Endemic of New-York, in 1795, is a&s;cribable to the peculiarity of the &s;ea&s;on, together with a greater accumulation, than u&s;ual, of the ordinary cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was not Contagious: i. e. communicated by contact of di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, by cloaths, nor by vi&s;iting the &s;ick, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. As it originated here, its prevention will depend on a change of the local and individual circum&s;tances which promote it.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Fever in 1795, exhibited &s;uch appearances as characterize what are cu&s;tomarily denominated In|flammatory Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is cured by the remedies &s;uited to remove In|flammatory Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="7"><PB REF="031169_0148_0feb132ddd3beeb8">7. The &s;ame cau&s;es which converted the ordinary Fever of New-York into the Yellow Fever, would change the Fever which prevails around our We&s;|tern Lakes into the Yellow Fever; and, as certainly, the Intermitting Fever of Sheffield: while the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a free ventilation, the filling up of all pools, yards, &amp;c. and a &s;crupulous attention to clean|line&s;s and &s;imple diet, would reduce our Fever to a &s;imple Remittent or Intermittent, or remove it alto|gether; as the filling up and cultivation of your ponds and mar&s;hes, would forever bani&s;h all Fevers of the kind&mdash;as general di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;from Sheffield.</P>
<P>I have now, my dear friend, performed the ta&s;k demanded of me, in the be&s;t manner I am able con|&s;i&s;tent with my lei&s;ure, and my duty towards others. I cannot conclude without once more &s;oliciting your indulgence, and reque&s;ting you to recollect with what expectations and confe&s;&s;ions I entered on the compo|&s;ition of the&s;e letters.&mdash;I have taken the words of Cicero for my motto&mdash;
<Q>Rationem, qu&ograve; ea me cumque ducet &s;equar&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>And if I have erred in my conceptions of what <HI>is</HI> rea&s;on, and what <HI>was</HI> fact, let my intentions prove my apology.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF, in our attempts to add to your information re&s;pecting the fever, which prevailed here in Augu&s;t la&s;t, we &s;hould draw upon us the illiberal &s;arca&s;ms, which we have ob&s;erved to attend all who endeavor to &s;erve their fellow creatures in this way, we mu&s;t leave it to you to ju&s;tify our intentions, at lea&s;t, be|ing our&s;elves unprepared to an&s;wer any thing which may be objected to what we &s;hall advance. We mean to &s;tate facts, or what we believe to be &s;uch, and willing to admit that there are &s;everal ways of curing the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. It will not be under&s;tood, that we reprobate the practice of others who follow a different mode of treatment. Our ob&s;ervations have been drawn from thirty years experience, with the advantage of records relating to &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es for a much longer period. We do not know of a more regular mode of treating the &s;ubject than by an&s;wering your inquiries in the order they occur, which will perhaps comprehend every thing required at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB REF="031169_0151_0feb13366c1c7330">The Fever we believe has its origin in the &s;ea&s;on, and exi&s;ts every year in various grades, beginning generally in the month of Augu&s;t, and disappearing about the middle of October.</P>
<P>The preci&s;e time of its commencement and termi|nation, and its degree of malignancy, depending upon contingent cau&s;es. We have been accu&s;tomed to call it a Bilious Remittent, with a tendency to putrefac|tion; whenever it proves uncommonly fatal, it is aggravated, according to the be&s;t of our ob&s;ervation, by the prevalence of &s;ome unu&s;ual weather for a long time together&mdash;Thus we have &s;een this di&s;ea&s;e equally malignant after a dry hot &s;ea&s;on, and after a very rainy period. The approach of fro&s;ty weather being uniformly the cure for the effects of either.&mdash; The Fever of the la&s;t autumnal &s;ea&s;on, appeared fir&s;t on the river, then on the &s;treets adjoining; was &s;oon after diffu&s;ed through the town and &s;uburbs, and finally the neighboring country; though in this la&s;t not generally: as u&s;ual it declined on the approach of cold weather.&mdash;The month of June had been very cool, and at the change of the moon, or a little be|fore, it began to rain in torrents, and &s;o continued to do, with &s;hort intervals of clo&s;e &s;ultry weather, till Augu&s;t, when a violent hurricane, attended with a flood of rain, laid wa&s;te the whole vegetable king|dom&mdash;afterwards the weather was as before, &s;ultry and moi&s;t, with profu&s;e &s;howers till the end of Sep|tember.&mdash;The fir&s;t appearance of the Fever was about the 10th of Augu&s;t; it increa&s;ed in violence and in exten&s;ion during all that month; it was per|ceived then to abate, and continued to do &s;o till the la&s;t day of September, when a few fro&s;ty nights &s;u|pervening, it di&s;appeared almo&s;t &s;uddenly and en|tirely.</P>
<P><PB REF="031169_0152_0feb13398b5876f8">There were perhaps more deaths, than for many years before; but whether greater in number to the proportion of the &s;ick, than is u&s;ual from autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, which prove as univer&s;al as that in que&s;tion, we cannot undertake to determine. The &s;ame mode of treatment generally &s;ucceeded&mdash;as in other &s;ea|&s;ons. Our method was plentiful depletion in the be|ginning, not by bleeding, but by purging with Jalap, Calomel, Scammony, Aloes, or by the milder purges, the Neutral Salts&mdash;Sennae, Rhubarb, Manna, &amp;c. as the age, &s;ex and con&s;titution of the patient pointed out,&mdash;taking care that the evacuation of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages was complete, by whatever means procured. As &s;oon as we judged that to be &s;ufficient&mdash;which we always endeavored to make &s;o with as little delay as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;the bark was admini&s;tered in all and every form that it could be made to remain, without re|gard to quantity, or to the period, or height of the fever, with wine, porter, and even brandy, if wine was rejected by the inclination, habit, or &s;tomach of the patient. We can a&s;&s;ure you, we have no rea&s;on to alter our mode of practice in future. In a multitude of in&s;tances, &s;ome will occur in all di&s;ea&s;es, when a change, and &s;ometimes a material change of reme|dies may be nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;&s;uch ca&s;es we found, and in tho&s;e we u&s;ed Bli&s;ters, Emetics, Camphor, Opium, and often ventured upon Cupping&mdash;but never upon venae&s;ection.&mdash;This la&s;t, a long cour&s;e of practice has taught us to be at lea&s;t, not advantageous. In diffe|rent climates, and under other circum&s;tances&mdash;when the di&s;ea&s;e may have appeared in other grades than tho&s;e we have experienced&mdash;that operation is perhaps found u&s;eful. We wi&s;h not to impo&s;e our opinion, as a rule for any per&s;on; &s;en&s;ible of the fallability of all human judgment. We ever thought it our duty to give up our own theories, when contradicted by events. We only mean to recommend that plan,

which long experience has taught us to be mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful. There is no proof that this di&s;ea&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any &s;pecific infection. It was rarely fatal to the na|tive inhabitants or the old &s;ettlers, &s;peaking of the town only; but we have been told that many of the traders from the Rivers and di&s;tant part of the State, died immediately after leaving the port. The terror which pervaded all parts of the country, and deprived tho&s;e victims of the common attentions of humanity, will ea&s;ily account for this without applying to the malignancy of the di&s;ea&s;e. All, or mo&s;t of tho&s;e born in, or who had been accu&s;tomed to a &s;outhern cli|mate, e&s;caped death, and when attacked, had the di&s;|ea&s;e in its milder form.</P>
<P>A large number of the inhabitants enjoyed unin|terrupted health; mo&s;t of the deaths happened in confined &s;treets and buildings, and in tho&s;e neare&s;t the river.&mdash;Tho&s;e who were accu&s;tomed to live well, (as it is termed) did not &s;uffer &s;o much as the poorer cla&s;s&mdash;But the intemperate of every de&s;cription be|came victims when attacked&mdash;The &s;mall pox imme|diately preceded this fever. We did not ob&s;erve that tho&s;e who had been the &s;ubjects of it were par|ticularly &s;ufferers.&mdash;There had been no malignant complaint in the preceding winter.</P>
<P>A particular de&s;cription of the fever, and its &s;ymp|toms, does not &s;eem to be here nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, it differed from the ordinary Bilious Remittent, only in the rapidity with which it pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;everal &s;tages, and in its malignancy.&mdash;This la&s;t circum&s;tance we are of opinion was occa&s;ioned by the long conti|nued and univer&s;al heat and moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;|phere.&mdash;The air was evidently impregnated with pu|trid effluvia, ari&s;ing from decayed &s;ub&s;tances of every &s;ort, brought down upon the creeks and rivers by the</P>
