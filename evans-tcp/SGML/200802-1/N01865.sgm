<HEAD>Some Ob&s;ervations On Receiving the SMALL-POX BY Ingrafting or Inoculating.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t had the Account of this common Practice in the <HI>Le|vant,</HI> and of the wonderful Succe&s;s of it there, given by <HI>Gentlemen of Learning</HI> to &s;uch a Body as that of the <HI>Royal Society in London,</HI> I could not but give Credit to their <HI>Te&s;timony,</HI> in a Matter of fact whereof they were Eye-Witne&s;&s;es. Immediately the <HI>little Phy|lo&s;ophy</HI> I am Ma&s;ter of led me into the <HI>apparent Rea&s;ons</HI> of the thing. The more readily &amp; ea&s;ily <HI>the&s;e</HI> occurr'd to me, the more I was affected with the Goodne&s;s of <HI>GOD Almighty</HI> therein to a Mi&s;erable World. I immediately tho't with my|&s;elf, and &s;aid to &s;ome <HI>Superior Per&s;ons</HI> in the Town, (who po&s;&s;ibly may remember it) What an a&s;toni&s;hing Mercy to <HI>Us</HI> in this Land, this
<PB N="2" REF="002211_0005_0FDACEC414E4FBD8">
Di&s;covery of a <HI>Gracious Providence</HI> might prove. The more I mus'd upon the thing, and di&s;cours'd upon it, the more light I had, or &s;eem'd to my &s;elf to have. It appear'd to me as rational as it was &s;urpri&s;ing, and gave me great plea&s;ure in the pro&s;pect of &s;o great a Benefit to Mankind. For I had not forgot the terrors of the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> when it was here the two la&s;t times, Nineteen and near Thirty Years &s;ince; tho' it was nothing &s;o Mortal either time as it had been before, (1678.) and has been now again. Be&s;ides it being now nineteen Years &s;ince the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> had been in the Town, it gave us a very dreadful pro&s;pect of Di&s;tre&s;s and Deaths, whenever it &s;hould come a|mong us; all the Children and all the Young People born in the Town, or come into it from the Country, within that long term of time having it before them. Now in proportion to the di&s;tre&s;s fore &s;een and expected by us, my Joy naturally ro&s;e upon the Di&s;covery of &s;uch a Way of Relief as &s;eem'd Opening before us, by the favour of GOD to us. In this &s;implicity of heart (I &s;peak before GOD who &s;earches it) I gave into a kind Opinion of this <HI>New Method;</HI> My Affection to my <HI>Country</HI> and the &s;aving the <HI>Lives</HI> of my Peo|ple being the Sole Motive to me, under the <HI>Glory</HI> that &s;hould thence redound unto the Name of GOD. I freely &s;pake my Tho'ts in Company and on Oc|ca&s;ions as it &s;eem'd proper to me, and when &s;ome publickly demanded of us, "<HI>Whether People could tru&s;t in GOD in u&s;ing this Means of &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation?</HI> I openly an&s;wer'd (among my <HI>Brethren</HI>) in the <HI>Affirmative,</HI> that I judg'd they might. This was after that Dr. <HI>Boyl&s;tone</HI> had begun the
<PB N="3" REF="002211_0006_0FDACEC5934B77E8">
practice, which I never put him upon, nor had I light to di&s;&s;wade him from it. According to my hope and Expectation it &s;ucceeded; altho' the fir&s;t Experiment was the mo&s;t di&s;couraging; for Mrs. <HI>Boyl&s;tone</HI> being in the Country and the <HI>Doctor</HI> taken up abroad among his Patients, the Children were too much expo&s;ed &amp; neglected, and from my hou&s;e (which faces into the Doctors yard) One of them was &s;een three or four days after their being Inoculated dabling in the cold water under the Pump. This or the like di&s;orders in the fir&s;t Inoculated <HI>Child</HI> threw him, as well they might, into a high and threatning fever. The cau&s;e was apparent to the Dr. and &s;o did not di&s;courage him, nor at all di&s;grace the practice with us that &s;aw it. It was a plea&s;ure however to &s;ee that the Small-Pox might be communicated, as the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> from the <HI>Levant</HI> had informed us. The next Ex|periments were made with more care, and accor|dingly more an&s;wered the Accounts which they had given us of a very <HI>light fever</HI> and <HI>few pu&s;tles.</HI> By this time the <HI>Town</HI> was full of the Sickne&s;s, and the Deaths that began to multiply led a few more into this <HI>Means of &s;afety;</HI> as they hop'd by the favour of GOD to find it. The Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD went along with it; they found <HI>ea&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;weetne&s;s,</HI> and lay prai&s;ing GOD on their Beds, or rather &s;at up in their Chairs doing &s;o. Their friends &s;tood &s;miling about them. Their tongues were filled with laughter, and ours with Thanks-giving on their account when we went to &s;ee 'em. We &s;aw them recover fa&s;t; the communicated Di&s;temper working uniformly upon them, and as one would de&s;ire. We &s;aw this with wonder and
<PB N="4" REF="002211_0007_0FDACEC712E2F9E8">
Joy at what GOD had wro't for us. We &s;aw <HI>Scores</HI> thus recover, even as many as went into the happy practice, and it appear'd to us more and more to be <HI>the Lord's Doing and mar|vellous in our eyes.</HI> They were as di&s;creet and religious a number of People, and Per&s;ons of as good &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding, and of as much cau|tion and fear as their Nei'bours, who made the&s;e Experiments; and they did it with meekne&s;s and humility, patience and &s;ilence, and many prayers, under much provocation from too many. Only <HI>one Gentlewoman</HI> has yet died out of an <HI>hun|dred,</HI> who have now pa&s;&s;ed thro' the Operation. But as you mu&s;t needs &s;uppo&s;e in a Town &s;o full of Infection as this has been, &s;ome ten or twelve of this number appear'd to have taken the In|fection in the common way; (among whom the Per&s;on deceas'd was evidently one) and accor|dingly they had it of the <HI>Confluent</HI> Kind, or in a fulne&s;s of the <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> &s;ort, not known among the Inoculated in the <HI>Levant.</HI> This will be &s;o far from &s;eeming &s;trange to you, that indeed it would be next to a <HI>Miracle</HI> had it been otherwi&s;e. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be allowed, that a good number of tho&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed &s;o favourably thro' the Inoculation, would probably have had it very favourably in the common way. But that &s;o many &s;hould pa&s;s &s;o favourably and <HI>ea&s;ily,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;afely,</HI> thro' the Inoculation; while their Nei'|bours had &s;o many in every hundred that <HI>&s;uffer'd</HI> &s;o much, as well as <HI>died,</HI> is a &s;ufficient Di&s;tinction put by Providence on the Method which we prai&s;e GOD for; and commend unto others, as GOD has commended it unto us.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002211_0008_0FDACEC896144860">
FOR my own part I would not willingly, (at lea&s;t unnece&s;&s;arily) &s;ay a word that &s;hould <HI>grieve,</HI> much le&s;s <HI>offend</HI> any one, in this pre&s;ent <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> which I hone&s;tly mean to <HI>&s;erve</HI> my Country, and not provoke my Nei'bours. I have no <HI>Inte|re&s;t</HI> to &s;erve by appearing for this Practice; but the contrary. If I knew any thing in prejudice again&s;t it, which might <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> be &s;aid, GOD knows I would offer it. <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> can now little be &s;erved by it, to what it might have been a few Months pa&s;t, and I may &s;eem to have been too long &s;ilent. But what I have &s;een of this dreadful Vi|&s;itation, from one Sick and Dying Chamber to another, (and it may be &s;carce any one has &s;een more) awakens me now to write for the &s;ake of <HI>other Towns,</HI> where the Sickne&s;s is prevailing, or whither it may come; that <HI>they</HI> may not put from them <HI>the Mercy</HI> of GOD in this particular, as it &s;eems to me that <HI>we</HI> have done. I can call upon <HI>my Brethren,</HI> the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who the mo&s;t of them have at times pa&s;s'd from the many &s;ad Spectacles of Woe, Corruption, Angui&s;h and Di&s;traction, to the Chambers of the <HI>Inocula|ted,</HI> to &s;ay in what ea&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s and &s;ere|nity <HI>the&s;e</HI> have lay. As the pa&s;&s;ing out of dark|ne&s;s into light, or from a tempe&s;tuous Sea into a Calm Haven, or from a place of horror, into a a Garden of plea&s;ure, &s;o it has been to us. A thou&s;and Compari&s;ons here offer them&s;elves to mind, which I &s;uppre&s;s becau&s;e they would &s;eem <HI>odious</HI> to &s;ome, however ju&s;t in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;ay, <HI>What I have &s;een in the Cham|bers of the Inoculated;</HI> for I have made it my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="002211_0009_0FDACECA16E61B38">
to vi&s;it &s;ome of them, and <HI>to ob&s;erve the Work of GOD to his prai&s;e;</HI> And what I blame in others is, that they have not vi&s;ited them, and without prejudice or pa&s;&s;ion, or regard to any private Intere&s;t or pique, informed them&s;elves as they might ea&s;ily have done of this great Thing which GOD has brought to light in our Day; and if I may &s;erve to &s;et it in any true light before others, I &s;hall account my &s;elf honoured of GOD therein.</P>
<P>KNOW then, That the <HI>Inci&s;ion</HI> which the <HI>Dr.</HI> makes in the Arm or Leg, are the lea&s;t you can well imagine, and but Skin deep; the quantity of the <HI>variolous matter</HI> which I have &s;een him u&s;e to good effect, has been but a &s;ingle and very &s;mall drop upon a bit of Lint. After twenty four hours we threw it entirely away and put on a dre&s;&s;ing of Cabbage leaf from day to day: for &s;ix and &s;ome|times eight days the Patient continues perfectly well; then a gentle Fever ri&s;es, accompanied with all the Symptoms of the Small-Pox, but in a low degree, an aching head and back, and pains in in the bones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This makes him dull and hea|vy for a Day or two, and pre&s;ently he finds him|&s;elf well and the Pock appears, ri&s;es, turns, and goes off without any more illne&s;s or pain, &s;ave what the burning and &s;orene&s;s of the Pock may oc|ca&s;ion to him, or &s;ome external Fever in the Fle&s;h without any inward one. For the fir&s;t &s;ix days I have found the I&s;&s;ues opened very little; and &s;eem'd to vent but little; yet in &s;ome bodies more than in others; but as the Fever comes on and the Pock begins to appear in the Skin, the Inci|&s;ions of their own accord begin to open and di&s;|charge,
<PB N="7" REF="002211_0010_0FDACECB935C38F8">
and as the Pock fills and ripens the I&s;&s;ues every Day widen and run more and more, till at the turning of the Pock the &s;ixth or &s;eventh Day, they come to their fulle&s;t flowing; and after two Days more they gradually decrea&s;e and abate and quickly heal of them&s;elves under the &s;ame dre&s;&s;ing of Cabbage-leaf, which had before drawn them. So <HI>gentle</HI> and <HI>perfect</HI> is <HI>Nature</HI> in this its own Work, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Medicine ordina|rily, and almo&s;t any need of Nur&s;ing. Neither is there need &s;carce of a Watcher by night, no more than of a Nur&s;e by Day, the Patient feels and eats &s;o well by Day, and &s;leeps &s;o well by night. He rarely complains of any pain in his Head, oppre&s;&s;ion at his Brea&s;t, &s;ore Throat, or Thir&s;t; and is &s;eldome offended with his own &s;mell.</P>
<P>BUT that which is the greate&s;t Benefit by Ino|culation, and indeed the apparent Cau&s;e of all the ea&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s experienc'd under it, is this, That as it <HI>moderates the fir&s;t Fever</HI> and the Symp|toms before the Eruption of the Pock, &s;o it &s;eems totally to prevent <HI>the &s;econd Fever</HI> at the turning of it, which is the fatal thing and time unto &s;o many: The evident rea&s;on whereof is, becau&s;e the <HI>Oil</HI> or putid matter that &s;hould be the Fuel with|in the Body for the flame or fever keeps running out from Day to Day at the Inci&s;ions: And be&s;ides, the Body not being cover'd with the Pock, and con&s;equently not with &s;cabs (and corruption un|der the &s;ame) when the Pock turns; as it has enjoyed a free per&s;piration by the Pores, &s;o there is no foul ma&s;s upon it to return in, and mix with the juices and blood; by which it is that in
<PB N="8" REF="002211_0011_0FDACECEF934E5C0">
the confluent and fluxy &s;ort, the Body is tainted a &s;econd time, as well as the per&s;piring (&s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary unto Life) is prevented. The Con&s;e|quence of this again is exceeding happy to the Inoculated, which is, That they have no After-blains and <HI>boils</HI> upon their bodies, which are &s;o frequent and terrible after the &s;uffering of the Small-Pox in the confluent kind: the rea&s;on whereof is apparent, Namely, Becau&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> keep open and running at and after the turning of the Pock, and &s;o di&s;charge freely and fully all the Ill ferment or humour, which if it where in part retain'd in the body would cau&s;e &s;wellings and boils. So that whereas there is in the other way very often a return <HI>in</HI> of &s;ome of the ejected poi|&s;ons, which taints the blood again; &s;o here is an ea&s;y gentle perpetual flow <HI>out,</HI> with a continued per&s;piration of the body, which prevents after boils, as well as the kindling any pre&s;ent con&s;u|ming flame within the patient.</P>
<P>IT is now &s;ome Months, four or five, &s;ince many of the Inoculated are come abroad, and they find neither boil nor &s;ore upon them; but are in as good a &s;tate of health as ever they en|joy'd in their Life: Nay &s;ome have found a much better Complexion and Stomach than ever they had before; and particularly my own <HI>Child</HI> has found &s;o thro' the favour of GOD.</P>
<P>I can tell too of a Woman in the weakne&s;s of Child-bed, who eight days after her Delivery came under the Inoculation to avoid the Small-Pox the common-way, GOD &s;ending it then into
<PB N="9" REF="002211_0012_0FDACECF94555E38">
the hou&s;e where &s;he was; and tho' &s;he had many more pu&s;tles than is u&s;ual in this Method, yet &s;he went chearfully thro' the Vi&s;itation, and even gain'd &s;trength while the Pock ro&s;e to as fine and large a head, of the di&s;tinct kind, as I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>WHEN the Patient in the common way of Infection would have but <HI>few</HI> pu&s;tles, he has to be &s;ure fewer, under the Inoculation: When he would el&s;e be exceeding <HI>full</HI> it greatly abates and le&s;&s;ens the number of the Pock; and when it would be the <HI>confluent</HI> and fluxy kind we have all the rea&s;on in the World to think that it prevents the &s;ame, and brings on a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> &s;ort; which &s;ort has but little danger attending it in the common way of Infection, and which only are proper to the Inoculation according to the Account given by the Gentlemen from the <HI>Levant.</HI> Sometimes the Inoculated whom I have &s;een have had a <HI>large</HI> and angry Pock and a good number of 'em too; &s;ometimes when there have not been many I have ob&s;erv'd &s;ome of tho&s;e that have appear'd and ri&s;en for two or three days to <HI>&s;ink</HI> away and di&s;|appear; yet have they created no feveri&s;h di&s;or|der when they have done &s;o, which looks as if they di&s;charged and vented them&s;elves by the In|ci&s;ions. Once I found a Young Man under the Inoculation full eno' to have given di&s;tre&s;s and danger as I apprehended, but his chearful eye and &s;miles immediately put me out of pain; profe&s;|&s;ing to me that he felt him&s;elf &s;o well within, that were it &s;afe or proper he tho't he could goe about his worldly bu&s;ine&s;s as well as ever in his Life. In others their fever has been high and

burning in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> when <HI>inwardly</HI> they have found no di&s;order; neither in head nor brea&s;t, but could breathe and &s;leep even as if in health, or next to it.</P>
<P>I boldly profe&s;s concerning as many as I have &s;een under the Inoculation, even when their Pock came to the height, <HI>&s;carce the &s;mell of &s;ickne&s;s has pa&s;&s;ed on them,</HI> in compari&s;on of what others un|dergo in the common way. In &s;ome the I&s;&s;ues &s;carce &s;mell at all, &s;o much as to them that dre&s;s 'em. It has &s;eem'd to me nothing more than what a Cabbage-leaf upon a <HI>common I&s;&s;ue</HI> mu&s;t needs cau&s;e at the end of 24 hours. Where the Patient would have <HI>many</HI> Pock in the common way, and con&s;equently have the more under the Inoculation, there the I&s;&s;ues mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to run the more. Where the <HI>Patient</HI> is fulle&s;t under the Inoculation I affirm I could never &s;mell their I&s;&s;ues at their Bed-&s;ide; no not when I have lean'd over their Bed on purpo&s;e to do it. Yet certainly the I&s;&s;ues do &s;mell more or le&s;s as the degree of the Di&s;temper is upon the Patient. And where the Infection is taken the common way, and the <HI>Confluent kind</HI> comes in the Erup|tion, there the I&s;&s;ues you may well think find much more to vent, and the Di&s;charge is <HI>more noi|&s;ome,</HI> like the running of the fluxy kind. But at the wor&s;t, even in <HI>this ca&s;e,</HI> the hours excepted wherein <HI>kidneys</HI> have been &s;ometimes applied to neck or feet, it is nothing, that I could ever find or hear, in compari&s;on of that prodigious <HI>&s;tench</HI> which is &s;o common for many days together under the fluxy &s;ort, wherein one can hardly bear the Rooms.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002211_0014_0FDACED253EA5BB0">
IT therefore appears to me one of the bolde&s;t <HI>Impo&s;itions</HI> on our Sen&s;es and Rea&s;on, that has been attempted &s;ince the Day wherein <HI>Tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation</HI> was obtruded and forced upon the Chri&s;tian World, to bear us down as &s;ome would, "<HI>That the Inoculation has caus'd the dreadful Ma|lignity and Infection</HI> which has been in the Town. To &s;ay this to <HI>Us</HI> who have been call'd from day to day to the many <HI>noxious Chambers,</HI> each of which have had <HI>poi&s;on</HI> eno' in 'em to have &s;pread the Town over, and which have been continually by day and night filling the Air with Infection by the Chimneys and doors, till at la&s;t the Windows have been thrown open too upon the Souls leaving the corrupted Body,&mdash;requires an <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> indeed. Our Nei'bours mu&s;t forgive us if we con|temn it as a mo&s;t fooli&s;h Opinion, and ridiculous Imputation. We mu&s;t call it &s;o, if not wor&s;e; or we mu&s;t forego our &s;en&s;e, and the common under|&s;tanding which GOD has given us. On the con|trary, I mu&s;t con&s;tantly think that the Inoculation has been an Abatement, and Prevention of the greater Malignity that would have been by more of the confluent and fluxy &s;ort. Be&s;ides, In fact, the Malignity and Mortality has not been now &s;o great, in proportion to our pre&s;ent numbers, as it was three and forty Year agoe, when in about fourteen Months we are told <HI>Eight hundred</HI> Peo|ple died of it; which I &s;uppo&s;e was a greater Mor|tality than if <HI>Eighteen</HI> hundred had died of it now. Some who were then Adult tell me what great numbers were then buried in a Week: Families were then de&s;olated and broken up, and the very fle&s;h rotted off the bones of &s;ome. And we at la&s;t

find too by &s;ad experience, that They under&s;tood as well the managing the Di&s;temper then as we do now: For when the Malignity comes to a Height, we find that we know very little or nothing what to do.</P>
<P>NOR does it appear to me at all rea&s;onable to think, that what the I&s;&s;ues of the Inoculated do di&s;charge, is at all Malignant like what is vented by a fluxy Maturated Pock, and after it turns and lies &s;tinking on the body: It is not filthy and putid, that ever I &s;aw, like the running Pock: It has not the time to come to the venome of that before it is thrown out, and then it is immediately taken away; and con&s;equently as it arrives to no &s;uch Malignity and Infection, &s;o it can commu|nicate none &s;uch.</P>
<P>MUCH has been &s;aid too, and dark hints given at times, about the <HI>Purple Spots</HI> in the skin, or <HI>blewi&s;h &s;tains</HI> which have been upon many and commonly are the &s;ure and fatal &s;igns of their ap|proaching death. But as <HI>the&s;e</HI> are &s;poken of by them that have wrote of the Small-Pox before our days; &s;o I very much que&s;tion whether the Bo|dies which I have &s;een &s;o &s;tained do yield any Malignant Infection equal to the corrupted and noi&s;ome Bodies of others that ly and putrify un|der the fluxy kind. I am &s;ure to my &s;en&s;es they have not at all &s;eem'd equally noxious. And when I rea&s;on upon the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of the&s;e &s;tains in the skin, it &s;eems generally to be the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Pock under it, which wants to come freely forth, but being ob&s;tructed by the <HI>Stagnation</HI> of the Blood it ri&s;es no higher than to di&s;colour the skin; which tho' it may well argue more Malignity

within and may give a more poi&s;onous breath to the Patient while he lives; yet Methinks the Pores of the Body do by no means breathe out the like Malignity as if the Pock ri&s;es &amp; breaks &amp; &s;tinks. How the ca&s;e may be in <HI>Spotted Fevers</HI> I know not, and whether I am right in what I have here advanced I &s;ubmit to the <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> and am ready to &s;tand corrected by their Judgment.</P>
<P>THERE yet remains three or four things which have occurred to me, which I think meet to ob|&s;erve or relate,</P>
<P>ONE is, That I am at pre&s;ent &s;trong in the Opi|nion, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons who had taken the In|fection before they were Inoculated, yet were greatly &s;erv'd in their Sickne&s;s by the running of their I&s;&s;ues, which vented much of the Inflamato|ry matter that would have increas'd their Fevers. Some who have recover'd have tho't &s;o them&s;elves, and &s;o have all about them. And as to the Gen|tlewoman that died, her Hu&s;band has told me that in his opinion the Inci&s;ions did much toward the pre&s;erving his Wife &s;o long, and &s;o far as &s;he was pre&s;erved thro' her &s;ore Vi&s;itation.</P>
<P>NEXTLY, I would ob&s;erve, That in ca&s;e the In|fection be taken the common way, and the Erup|tion would not have been in &s;ome Weeks; As we certainly know that it will ly in the Body &s;ome|times a Month before it breaks out; yet the in|fected Per&s;on coming under the Inoculation, it will bring on the Di&s;temper at the u&s;ual time of &s;even or eight days. Not only the rea&s;on but the nece&s;|&s;ity of this &s;eems very plain; and it accounts for a Difficulty with &s;ome, which is, Why the Sickne&s;s comes at the period proper to the Inoculation, and
<PB N="14" REF="002211_0017_0FDACED6D76EAC28">
yet it proves the confluent kind which is not pro|per to it.</P>
<P>I lately met with a <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> on the Small-Pox wherein the <HI>Author</HI> advances this Rule or Maxim, <Q>That all venemous Particles do fir&s;t enter the Body thro' the Pores of the skin, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">roud in|to the Humours &amp; juices, &amp; thence into the &s;an|guin Parts. From hence he accounts why the face &amp; hands &amp; feet are u&s;ually fulle&s;t of Pocks, becau&s;e tho&s;e parts of the body are more open and expo&s;ed for the admi&s;&s;ion or entrance of tho&s;e venomous Particles.</Q></P>
<P>I carry'd on the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> in my own mind a little further, by that <HI>Modern Ob&s;ervation</HI> which has been made of a Multitude of <HI>Animalcula</HI> on every Pu&s;tle of the Small-Pox: <HI>The&s;e</HI> they tell us their Gla&s;&s;es have di&s;cover'd; and that our com|mon Infection is by &s;warms of the&s;e. If &s;o, Me|tho't the&s;e living Minute Particles, the&s;e Animated Atoms if I might &s;o &s;peak, may much more ea&s;ily find their way into our Pores &amp; &s;o into our bodies, than if they were Inanimate.</P>
<P>BUT if one Hypothe&s;is or other may be at all admitted, with this further &amp; mo&s;t rea&s;onable tho't upon them, that the&s;e <HI>venemous Particles</HI> or <HI>Ani|malcules</HI> do al&s;o flow into our no&s;trils, throat and blood by our breath; then may they not give us a <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> why the Small-Pox communicated by Inci|&s;ions in the way of Inoculation, does not produce <HI>&s;o many</HI> Pock, and &s;uch a <HI>flame</HI> &amp; <HI>corruption</HI> in the body, as in the common way of Infection it ordi|narily does? Becau&s;e in this way not &s;o many en|ter&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or immediately into &s;uch parts of hazard and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s, as in the no&s;trils, throat &amp; inwards?&mdash;

But I pretend not to argue, on <HI>Principles</HI> or <HI>Premi|&s;es,</HI> which are them&s;elves uncertain; and ly open to many Objections which I could never an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I will only add upon all a plain, but to me plea|&s;ing &amp; informing <HI>di&s;cour&s;e</HI> I lately had with a <HI>poor Negro,</HI> whom I found at work where I made a vi&s;it, and the <HI>Gentleman</HI> of the Hou&s;e told me the Fellow had been Inoculated in his own Country. Where|upon I put &s;everal que&s;tions to him, in an&s;wer to which he told me, That he liv'd in a great Town in his own Country, and when the Small-Pox came into it they did what they could to prevent the &s;preading of it; that the Families that were fir&s;t vi&s;ited u&s;ually died among them; but when the Sickne&s;s got into five or &s;ix hou&s;es, &s;o that the Peo|ple began to de&s;pair of being able to &s;top it, then all who had not had it went pre&s;ently &amp; receiv'd it in the way of Inoculation, (as we call it) and that not one more died of it thro' the whole Town.</P>
<P>WE do not &s;tay therefore (&s;aid he) till the Town be infected, and People have many of them got the Sickne&s;s within them, and then go &amp; take it; but a whole place takes it in a Week &amp; are well in a Week. (I u&s;e but &s;ome of his words here, giving the true &s;en&s;e of what he &s;aid to me.)</P>
<P>HE went on in an&s;wer to the que&s;tions I put to him, and told me, "That he never knew of any blains or boils following this practice in his Coun|try; that as to him&s;elf none had troubled him, any more than what others are &s;ubject to; &amp; that He never heard of any bodies having it again in his Country; but to prove that his Country men think them&s;elves as &s;ecure from it as any of us may do, he told me, That &s;ometimes when Young men among them wanted to go a trading two or three hundred

Miles off, but were afraid becau&s;e they had not yet had the Small-Pox, it was common for them to en|quire where it was, &amp; go to the place &amp; be Inocu|lated, &amp; then go &amp; trade any where without fear. When I a&s;k'd him (what I did not at all &s;uppo&s;e he could imform me in) How his Country-men came into the knowledge of this way of giving the Small-Pox? &amp; how long it had been among them? he told me he knew nothing of tho&s;e things; he &s;uppos'd it was long before he was born; and no doubt" but GOD told it to poor Negroes to &s;ave their lives; for they had not knowledge &amp; skill as we have.</P>
<P>I believe I &s;hall be &s;coff'd at for telling this <HI>Simple</HI> &s;tory, but I think it very pertinent &amp; much to the purpo&s;e here; and who&s;oever &s;eeks the Truth &amp; de&s;ires to be informed will not de&s;pi&s;e it. And he that has learnt any thing as he ought, has this&mdash;to be willing to learn of the poore&s;t <HI>Slave</HI> in the Town.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I do not think that I at all go out of my <HI>Line</HI> in the pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay. The plain intent of it is to &s;erve unto the pre&s;erving of Life, and to mini&s;ter unto the comfort of Families. This is a Care be&s;eeming me, or any one el&s;e, if it be manag'd with mode&s;ty &amp; decency. My care to do it &s;o, is I think vi&s;ible eno' in the pre&s;ent writing. I have avoided any appearance of &s;eeming learned in <HI>Phy&s;ick.</HI> I am not: Nor &s;hall I matter it at all, if I have betray'd my Ignorance therein. I write with another de&s;ign, &amp; if that be an&s;wer'd I have all my de&s;ire; or if it be rejected with &s;corn and revil'd I &s;hall be &s;atisfyed in <HI>this,</HI> That I have again endeavoured the Good of this People.</P>
