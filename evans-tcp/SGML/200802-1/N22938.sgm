<P>IT is an unhappine&s;s into which the people of this age are fallen, that luxury is become fa&s;honable and too ge|nerally preferred to frugality. Prodi|gality is now-a-days tricked up in the pompous titles of genero&s;ity and gran|deur; whil&s;t ble&s;t frugality is too often branded as the badge of an avaricious and &s;ordid &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THIS error has &s;o far &s;educed us, as to prevail on many to renounce a frugal way of living, though taught by nature, and to indulge tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which &s;erve
<PB N="2" REF="030282_0006_0FE59E5569FD4098">
only to abridge the number of our days. We are grown old before we have been able to ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of being young. And the time which ought to be the &s;ummer of our lives is often the begin|ning of their winter.</P>
<P>OH unhappy Italy! Doe&s;t thou not &s;ee, that gluttony and exce&s;s rob thee, every year, of more inhabitants than pe&s;tilence, war, and famine could have done? Thy true plagues, are thy nu|merous luxuries in which thy deluded ci|tizens indulge them&s;elves to an exce&s;s unworthy of the rational character, and utterly ruinous to their health. Put a &s;top to this fatal abu&s;e, for God's &s;ake, for there is not, I am certain of it, a vice more abominable in the eyes of the divine Maje&s;ty, nor any more de&s;truc|tive. How many have I &s;een cut off, in the flower of their days by this unhappy cu&s;tom of high feeding! How many ex|cellent friends has gluttony deprived me
<PB N="3" REF="030282_0007_0FE59E5700D082E8">
of, who, but for this accur&s;ed vice, might have been an ornament to the world, an honour to their country, and have af|forded me as much joy in their lives, as I now feel concern at their deaths.</P>
<P>IN order, therefore, to put a &s;top to &s;o great an evil, I have undertaken this lit|tle book, and I attempt it the more readi|ly, as many young gentlemen have re|que&s;ted it of me, moved thereto by &s;ee|ing their fathers drop off in the flower of their youth, and me &s;o &s;ound and hearty at the age of eighty-one. They begged me to let them know by what means I attained to &s;uch excellent health and &s;pirits at my time of life. I could not but think their curio&s;ity very laud|able, and was willing to gratify them, and at the &s;ame time do &s;ome &s;ervice to my countrymen, by declaring, in the fir&s;t place, what led me to renounce intem|perance and lead a temperate life; &s;e|condly, by &s;hewing the rules I ob&s;erved;
<PB N="4" REF="030282_0008_0FE59E59119F6210">
and thirdly, what un&s;peakable &s;atisfac|tion and advantage I derived from it; whence it may be very clearly &s;een how ea&s;y a thing it is for a wi&s;e man to e&s;cape all the cur&s;es of intemperance, and &s;ecure to him&s;elf the ine&s;timable felicities of vigorous health and chearful age.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing that led me to em|brace a temperate life, was, the many and &s;ore evils which I &s;uffered from the contrary cour&s;e of living; my con&s;titution was naturally weakly and delicate, which ought in rea&s;on to have made me more regular and prudent, but being like mo&s;t young men, too fond of what is u&s;ually called good eating and drinking, I gave the rein to my appetites. In a little time I began to feel the ill ef|fects of &s;uch intemperance; for I had &s;carce attained to my thirty-fifth year, be|fore I was attacked with a complication of di&s;orders, &s;uch as, head-achs, a &s;ick &s;tomach, cholicky unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, the gout,
<PB N="5" REF="030282_0009_0FE59E5E554FE308">
rheumatic pains, lingering fevers, and continual thir&s;t; and though I was then but in the middle of my days, my con|&s;titution &s;eemed &s;o entirely ruined that I could hardly hope for any other termi|nation to my &s;ufferings but death.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t phy&s;icians in Italy employed all their &s;kill in my behalf, but to no ef|fect. At la&s;t they told me, very candidly, that there was but one thing that could afford me a &s;ingle ray of hope, but one medicine that could give a radical cure, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the immediate adoption of a temper|ate and regular life. They added more|over, that, now, I had no time to lo&s;e, that I mu&s;t immediately, either chu&s;e a regimen or death, and that if I deferred their advice much longer, it would be too late for ever to do it. This was a home thru&s;t. I could not bear the thoughts of dying &s;o &s;oon, and being con|vinced of their abilities and experience, I thought the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e I could take,
<PB N="6" REF="030282_0010_0FE59E609D10EEE8">
would be to follow their advice, how di&s;agreeable &s;oever it might &s;eem.</P>
<P>I THEN reque&s;ted my phy&s;icians to tell me exactly after what manner I ought to govern my&s;elf? To this they replied, that I &s;hould always con&s;ider my&s;elf as an in|firm per&s;on; eat nothing but what agreed with me, and that in &s;mall quantity. I then immediately entered on this new cour&s;e of life, and, with &s;o determined a re&s;olution, that nothing has been &s;ince able to divert me from it. In a few days I perceived that this new way of living agreed very well with me; and in le&s;s than a twelvemonth I had the un&s;peak|able happine&s;s to find that all my late a|larming &s;ymptoms were vani&s;hed, and that I was perfectly re&s;tored to health.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had I began to ta&s;te the &s;weets of this new re&s;urrection, but I made many very plea&s;ing reflections on the great advantage of temperance, and thought within my&s;elf, <Q>if this virtue has
<PB N="7" REF="030282_0011_0FE59E62863FFDA8">
had &s;o divine an efficacy, as to cure me of &s;uch grievous di&s;orders, &s;urely it will help my bad con&s;titution and con|firm my health.</Q> I therefore applied my&s;elf diligently to di&s;cover what kinds of food were propere&s;t for me, and made choice of &s;uch meats and drinks only as agreed with my con&s;titution, ob&s;erving it as an inviolable law with my&s;elf, <HI>always to ri&s;e with an appetite to eat more if I plea&s;|ed.</HI> In a word, I entirely renounced in|temperance, and made a vow to continue the remainder of my life under the &s;ame regimen I had ob&s;erved: A happy re&s;o|lution this! The keeping of which entire|ly cured me of all my infirmities. I ne|ver before lived a year together, without falling once, at lea&s;t, into &s;ome violent ill|ne&s;s; but this never happened to me af|terwards; on the contrary, I have always been healthy ever &s;ince I was temperate.</P>
<P>I MUST not forget here to mention a circum&s;tance of con&s;iderable con&s;e|quence.
<PB N="8" REF="030282_0012_0FE59E65259C8658">
I have been telling of a great, and to me, a mo&s;t happy change in my way of living. Now all changes, tho' from the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> to the <HI>be&s;t</HI> habits, are, at fir&s;t, di&s;agreeable, I found it &s;o; for having long accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to high feeding, I had contracted &s;uch a fond|ne&s;s for it, that though I was daily de|&s;troying my&s;elf, yet did it, at fir&s;t, co&s;t me &s;ome &s;truggle to relinqui&s;h it. Na|ture, long u&s;ed to hearty meals, expected them, and was quite di&s;&s;atisfied with my moderate repa&s;ts. To divert my mind from the&s;e little di&s;&s;atisfactions, I u&s;ed immediately after dinner, to betake my|&s;elf to &s;ome innocent amu&s;ement or u&s;e|ful pur&s;uit, &s;uch as, my devotions, my book, mu&s;ic, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT to return.&mdash;Be&s;ides the two fore|going important rules about eating and drinking, that is, not to take of any thing, but as much as my &s;tomach could ea&s;ily dige&s;t, and to u&s;e tho&s;e things only
<PB N="9" REF="030282_0013_0FE59E6978836840">
which agreed with me. I have very carefully avoided all <HI>extremes</HI> of <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>cold,</HI> exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, interruption of my u&s;ual time of re&s;t, <HI>late hours,</HI> and <HI>too clo&s;e</HI> and <HI>inten&s;e thinking.</HI> I am likewi&s;e greatly indebted for the excellent health I enjoy, to that calm and temperate &s;tate in which I have been careful to keep my pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE influence of the pa&s;&s;ions on the nerves, and health of our bodies, is &s;o great, that none can po&s;&s;ibly be ignorant of it. He therefore who &s;eriou&s;ly wi&s;hes to enjoy good health, mu&s;t, above all things, learn to conquer his pa&s;&s;ions, and keep them in &s;ubjection to rea&s;on. For let a man be never &s;o temperate in diet, or regular in exerci&s;e, yet &s;till &s;ome unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, if indulged to exce&s;s, will prevail over all his regularity, and prevent the good effects of his tempe|rance; no words, therefore, can ade|quately expre&s;s the wi&s;dom of guarding
<PB N="10" REF="030282_0014_0FE59E6B4E22C640">
again&s;t an influence &s;o de&s;tructive. Fear, anger, grief, envy, hatred, malice, re|venge and de&s;pair, are known by eter|nal experience, to weaken the nerves, di&s;order the circulation, impair dige&s;|tion, and often to bring on a long train of hy&s;terical and hypochondriacal di&s;or|ders; and extreme &s;udden fright, has often occa&s;ioned immediate death.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, moderate joy, and all tho&s;e affections of the mind which partake of its nature, as chearfulne&s;s, contentment, hope, virtuous and mutual love, and courage in doing good, invi|gorate the nerves, give a healthy motion to the fluids, promote per&s;piration, and a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion; but violent anger (which differs from madne&s;s only in duration) throws the whole frame into tempe&s;t and convul&s;ion, the countenance blackens, the eyes glare, the mouth foams, and in place of the mo&s;t gentle and amiable, it makes a man the mo&s;t frightful and ter|rible
<PB N="11" REF="030282_0015_0FE59E6D54352438">
of all animals. The effects of this dreadful pa&s;&s;ion do not &s;top here; it never fails to create bilious, inflamma|tory, convul&s;ive, and &s;ometimes apoplec|tic di&s;orders, and &s;udden death.</P>
<P>SOLOMON was thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the de&s;tructive tendencies of ungovern|ed pa&s;&s;ions, and has, in many places, cau|tioned us again&s;t them. He emphati|cally &s;tyles <Q>envy a rottenne&s;s of the bones;</Q> and &s;ays, that <Q>wrath &s;lay|eth the angry man, and envy killeth the &s;illy one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THE reader will I hope excu&s;e me for relating the following tragical anecdote, to confirm what the benevolent Cornaro has &s;aid on the baneful effects of envy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN the city of York in England, there died &s;ome time ago, a young lady by the name of D&mdash;n. For five years before her death, &s;he appeared to be lingering and melancholy. Her fle&s;h withered away, her appetite decayed, her &s;trength failed, her feet could no longer &s;u&s;tain her tottering emaciated body, and her di&s;&s;olution &s;eemed at hand. One day &s;he called her intimate friends to her bed-&s;ide, and as well as &s;he could, &s;poke to the following effect:</P>
<P>"I KNOW you all pity me, but alas! I am not worthy of your pity; for all my mi&s;ery is entirely ow|ing to the wickedne&s;s of my own heart. I have two &s;i&s;ters; and I have all my life been unhappy, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e of their pro&s;perity. When we were young, I could neither eat nor &s;leep in com|fort, if they had either prai&s;e or plea&s;ure. As &s;oon as they were grown to be women, they married great|ly to their advantage and &s;atisfaction: this galled me to the heart; and though I had &s;everal good offers, yet thinking them rather unequal to my &s;i&s;ters, I re|fu&s;ed them, and then was inwardly vexed and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, for fear I &s;hould get no better. I never wanted for any thing, and might have been very happy, but for this wretched temper. My &s;i&s;ters loved me tenderly, for I concealed from them as much as po&s;&s;ible this odious pa&s;&s;ion, and yet never did any poor wretch lead &s;o mi&s;erable a life as I have done, for every ble&s;&s;ing they enjoyed was a dagger to my heart. 'Tis this Envy, which, preying on my very vitals, has ruined my health, and is now carrying me down to the grave. Pray for me, that GOD of his infinite mercy may forgive me this hor|rid &s;in; and with my dying breath I conjure you all, to check the fir&s;t ri&s;ings of a pa&s;&s;ion that has proved &s;o fatal to me."</P></NOTE>;</Q> and, <Q>that the wick|ed &s;hall not live out half their days.</Q>
<PB N="12" REF="030282_0016_0FE59E6FB45F5558">
For as violent gales of wind will &s;oon wreck the &s;tronge&s;t &s;hips, &s;o violent pa&s;|&s;ions of hatred, anger, and &s;orrow, will &s;oon de&s;troy the be&s;t con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I mu&s;t confe&s;s to my &s;hame, that I have not been at all times
<PB N="13" REF="030282_0017_0FE59E73D5098B38">
&s;o much of a philo&s;opher and Chri&s;tian, as entirely to avoid the&s;e di&s;orders: but I have reaped the benefit of knowing by my own repeated experience, that the&s;e malignant pa&s;&s;ions have in general a far le&s;s pernicious effect on bodies that are rendered firm and vigorous by tempe|rance, than on tho&s;e that are corrupted and weakened by gluttony and exce&s;s.</P>
<P>IT was hard for me to avoid every ex|treme of heat and cold, and to live above all the occa&s;ions of trouble which attend the life of man; but yet the&s;e things made no great impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;tate of my health, though I met with many in&s;tances of per&s;ons who &s;unk under le&s;s weight both of body and mind.</P>
<P>THERE was in our family a con&s;ider|able law-&s;uit depending again&s;t &s;ome per|&s;ons, who&s;e might overcame our right. One of my brothers, and &s;ome of my relations, were &s;o mortified and grieved on account of the lo&s;s of this &s;uit, that
<PB N="14" REF="030282_0018_0FE59E763695F408">
they actually died of broken hearts. I was as &s;en&s;ible as they could be, of the great inju&s;tice done us, but thank GOD, &s;o far from breaking my heart, it &s;carce|ly broke my repo&s;e. And I a&s;cribe <HI>their</HI> &s;ufferings and <HI>my</HI> &s;afety, to the difference of our living. Intemperance and &s;loth had &s;o weakened their nerves, and bro|ken their &s;pirits, that they ea&s;ily &s;unk under the weight of misfortune. While temperance and active life had &s;o invigo|rated my con&s;titution, as to make me happily &s;uperior to the evils of this mo|mentary life.</P>
<P>AT &s;eventy years of age, I had another experiment of the u&s;efulne&s;s of my regi|men. Some bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence calling me into the country, my coach-hor&s;es ran away with me; I was over&s;et and dragged a long way before they could &s;top the hor&s;es. They took me out of the coach with my head batter|ed, a leg and an arm out of joint, and
<PB N="15" REF="030282_0019_0FE59E784B9564A0">
truly in a very lamentable condition. As &s;oon as they had brought me home, they &s;ent for the phy&s;icians, who did not expect I could live three days: however, I was &s;oon cured, to the great a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the phy&s;icians, and of all tho&s;e who know me.</P>
<P>I BEG leave to relate one more anec|dote, as an additional proof what an impenetrable &s;hield temperance pre&s;ents again&s;t the evils of life.</P>
<P>ABOUT five years ago, I was over-per|&s;uaded to a thing, which had like to have co&s;t me dear. My relations, whom I love, and who have a real tenderne&s;s for me; my friends, with whom I was willing to comply in any thing that was rea&s;onable; la&s;tly, my phy&s;icians, who were looked upon as the oracles of health, did all agree that I eat too little; that the nou|ri&s;hment I took was not &s;ufficient for one of my years; that I ought not only to &s;upport nature, but likewi&s;e to increa&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="030282_0020_0FE59E7A87424AA8">
the vigour of it, by eating a little more than I did. It was in vain for me to re|pre&s;ent to them, that nature is content with a little; that with this little I had enjoyed excellent health &s;o many years; that to me the habit of it was become a &s;econd nature; and that it was more agreeable to rea&s;on, that as I advanced in years and lo&s;t my &s;trength, I &s;hould rather <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> than <HI>increa&s;e</HI> the quantity of my food, e&s;pecially as the powers of the &s;tomach mu&s;t grow weaker from year to year. To &s;trengthen my arguments, I urged tho&s;e two natural and true pro|verbs; one, that he who would eat a great deal mu&s;t eat but little; that is eat|ing little makes a man live long, he mu&s;t eat a great deal. The other proverb was, that what we leave, after making a hear|ty meal, does us more good than what we have eaten. But neither my proverbs nor arguments could &s;ilence their affec|tionate intreaties. Wherefore to plea&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="030282_0021_0FE59E7EEB229270">
per&s;ons who where &s;o dear to me, I con|&s;ented to increa&s;e the quantity of food, but with too ounces only. So that, as before I had always taken but twelve ounces of &s;olid food in the day, I now increa&s;ed it to fourteen, and as before I drank but fourteen ounces of wine in the day, I now increa&s;ed it to &s;ixteen. This increa&s;e had in eight days time &s;uch an effect on me, that from being remark|ably chearful and bri&s;k, I began to be peevi&s;h and melancholy, and was con|&s;tantly &s;o &s;trangely di&s;po&s;ed, that I nei|ther knew what to &s;ay to others, nor what to do with my&s;elf. On the twelfth day I was attacked with a mo&s;t violent pain in my &s;ide, which held me twenty-two hours, and was followed by a violent fever which continued thirty-five days, without giving me a moment's re&s;pite. However GOD be prai&s;ed, I recovered, though in my &s;eventy-eighth year, and in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on of a very cold winter,
<PB N="18" REF="030282_0022_0FE59E80A95C2280">
and reduced to a mere &s;keleton; and I am po&s;itive, that, next to GOD, I am mo&s;t indebted to temperance, for my recovery. O how great is the evil of intemperance, which could, in a few days bring on me &s;o &s;evere an illne&s;s, and how glorious are the virtues of temperance, which could thus bear me up, and &s;natch me from the jaws of death!

<HEAD>CHAP. II. THE METHOD OF CORRECTING A BAD CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born with a very choleric, ha&s;ty di&s;po&s;ition; flew into a pa&s;&s;ion for the lea&s;t trifle, huffed every body about me, and was &s;o intolerably di&s;agreeable, that many per&s;ons of gentle manners ab&s;o|lutely
<PB N="42" REF="030282_0046_0FE59EBF711B3E48">
&s;hunned my company. On di&s;|covering how great an injury I was do|ing my&s;elf, I at once re&s;olved to make this vile temper give way to rea&s;on. I con&s;idered that a man overcome by pa&s;|&s;ion, mu&s;t at times, be no better than a madman, and that the only difference between a pa&s;&s;ionate and a madman, is, that the one has lo&s;t his rea&s;on for ever, and the other is deprived of it by fits only; but that in one of the&s;e, though never &s;o &s;hort, he may do &s;ome deed of cruelty or death, that will ruin his cha|racter, and de&s;troy his peace <HI>for ever.</HI> A &s;ober life, by cooling the fever of the blood, contributed much to cure me of this frenzy; and I am now become &s;o moderate, and &s;o much a ma&s;ter of my pa&s;&s;ion, that no body could perceive that it was born with me.</P>
<P>IT is true indeed, the mo&s;t temperate may &s;ometimes be indi&s;po&s;ed, but then they have the plea&s;ure to think that it
<PB N="43" REF="030282_0047_0FE59EC120563A90">
is not the effect of their own vices; that it will be but moderate in its <HI>degree,</HI> and of &s;hort continuance.</P>
<P>MANY have &s;aid to me, "<HI>How can you, when at a table covered with a dozen delicious di&s;hes content your&s;elf with one di&s;h, and that the plaine&s;t too at the table? It mu&s;t &s;urely be a great mortification to you, to &s;ee &s;o many charming things before you, and yet &s;carcely ta&s;te them.</HI>" This que&s;|tion has frequently been put to me, and with an air of &s;urprize. I confe&s;s it has often made me unhappy; for it proves that &s;uch per&s;ons are got to &s;uch a pa&s;s, as to look on the gratification of their appetites as the highe&s;t happine&s;s, not con&s;idering that the mind is properly the man, and that it is in the affections of a virtuous and pious mind, a man is to look for his true&s;t and highe&s;t happi|ne&s;s. When I &s;it down, with my eleven grand-children, to a table covered with various dainties, of which, for the &s;ake
<PB N="44" REF="030282_0048_0FE59EC33081F418">
of a light ea&s;y &s;tomach, I may not, at times, chu&s;e to partake, yet this is no mortificaton to me; on the contrary, I often find my&s;elf mo&s;t happy at the&s;e times. How can it otherwi&s;e than give me great delight when I think of that goodne&s;s of GOD, which ble&s;&s;es the earth with &s;uch immen&s;e &s;tores of good things for the u&s;e of mankind; and which, over and above all this goodne&s;s, has put me into the way of getting &s;uch an abundance of them for my dear grand-children; and, be&s;ides mu&s;t it not make me very happy to think that I have gotten &s;uch a ma&s;tery over my&s;elf as never to abu&s;e any of tho&s;e good things, but am perfectly contented with &s;uch a portion of them as keeps me al|ways in good health. O what a tri|umph of joy is this to my heart! What a &s;ad thing it is that young people will not take in&s;truction, nor get benefit from tho&s;e who are older and wi&s;er than
<PB N="45" REF="030282_0049_0FE59EC951FF8B40">
them&s;elves! I may u&s;e, in this matter, the words of the wi&s;e man, "I have &s;een all things that are done under the &s;un." I know the plea&s;ures of eating, and I know the joys of a virtuous mind, and can &s;ay from long experience, that the one excelleth the other as far as light excelleth darkne&s;s; the one are the plea&s;ures of a mere animal, the other tho&s;e of an angel.</P>
<P>SOME are &s;o thoughtle&s;s as to &s;ay, that they had rather be afflicted twice or thrice a year with the gout, and o|ther di&s;tempers, than deny them&s;elves the plea&s;ure of eating and drinking to the full of &s;uch things as they like; that for their part they had rather eat and drink as they like, though it &s;hould &s;horten their lives, that is, "give them a &s;hort life and a merry one." It is really a &s;urpri&s;ing and <HI>&s;ad</HI> thing, to &s;ee rea&s;onable creatures, &s;o ready to &s;wal|low the mo&s;t dangerous ab&s;urdities. For
<PB N="46" REF="030282_0050_0FE59ECB350CA488">
how, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, can the life of a glutton or a &s;ot be a merry one? If men could eat to exce&s;s, drink to &s;illine&s;s, and ru&s;t in &s;loth, and after all, &s;uffer no other harm than the a|bridgement of ten or a dozen years of life, they might have &s;ome little excu&s;e for calling it a merry life, though &s;urely it could appear &s;o to none but per&s;ons of a &s;adly vitiated ta&s;te. But &s;ince an intemperate life will a&s;&s;uredly &s;ow in our bodies the &s;eeds of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es as will, after a few &s;hort years of feveri&s;h plea&s;ure, make life a burthen to us, with what face can any rea&s;onable be|ing call this a merry life?</P>
<P>O SACRED and mo&s;t bountiful Tem|perance! how greatly am I indebted to thee for re&s;cuing me from &s;uch fatal de|lu&s;ions; and for bringing me, through the divine benediction, to the enjoy|ment of &s;o many felicities, and which, over and above all the&s;e favours confer|red

on thine old man, ha&s;t &s;o &s;trength|ened his &s;tomach, that he has now a better reli&s;h for his dry bread than he had formerly for the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite dainties, &s;o that, by eating little, my &s;to|mach is often craving after the manna, which I &s;ometimes fea&s;t on with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that I &s;hould think I tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on the duty of temperance, did I not know that one mu&s;t eat to &s;upport life; and that one cannot u&s;e a plainer or more natural diet.</P>
<P>MY &s;pirits are not injured by what I eat, they are only revived and &s;upported by it. I can, immediately on ri&s;ing from table, &s;et my&s;elf to write or &s;tudy, and never find that this application, though &s;o hurtful to hearty feeders, does me any harm; and, be&s;ides, I never find my&s;elf drow&s;ey after dinner, as a great many do;&mdash;the rea&s;on is, I feed &s;o temperately, as never to load my &s;tomach nor oppre&s;s my nerves, &s;o

But thou ha&s;t not been able to de&s;troy me accord|ing to thy wicked intent and purpo&s;e. I am &s;till alive in &s;pite of thee, and have attained to &s;uch an age, as to &s;ee around me eleven dear grand-children, all of fine under&s;tandings, and amiable di&s;po|&s;itions, all given to learning and virtue; all beautiful in their per&s;ons and lovely in their manners, whom, had I not aban|doned thee thou infamous &s;ource of cor|ruption, I &s;hould never have had the plea&s;ure to behold.

as required no &s;mall time to attain their pre&s;ent perfection. No, thou ac|cur&s;ed hag, thy nature is to impoveri&s;h and de&s;troy tho&s;e who follow thee.

<P>IT is really a very &s;urpri&s;ing and &s;ad thing to &s;ee per&s;ons grown to men's e&s;tate, and of fine wit, yet unable to govern their appetites, but tamely &s;ub|mitting to be dragged by them into &s;uch exce&s;&s;es of eating and drinking, as not only to ruin the be&s;t con&s;titutions, and &s;horten their lives, but eclip&s;e the lu&s;tre of the brighte&s;t parts, and bury them|&s;elves in utter contempt and u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A LETTER FROM SIGNIOR LEWIS COR|NARO TO THE RIGHT REVEREND BARBARO, PATRIARCH OF AQUI|LEIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT thanks do we not owe to the divine goodne&s;s, for this wonderful invention of writing, whereby we can ea&s;ily communicate to our ab&s;ent friends, whatever may afford them plea|&s;ure or improvement! By means of this mo&s;t welcome contrivance, I &s;hall now endeavour to entertain you with matters of the greate&s;t moment. It is true in|deed, that what I have to tell you is no news,&mdash;but I never told it you at the age of <HI>ninety-one.</HI> Is it not a charming thing, that I am able to tell you, that my health and &s;trength are in &s;o excellent a
<PB N="53" REF="030282_0057_0FE59EDEA96726D0">
&s;tate, that, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing with my age, they &s;eem to increa&s;e as I grow old? All my acquaintance are &s;urpri&s;ed at it; but I, who know the cau&s;e of this &s;ingular happine&s;s, do every where de|clare it. I endeavour, as much as in me lies, to convince all mankind, that a man may enjoy a paradi&s;e on earth even after the age of four-&s;core.</P>
<P>Now my Lord, I mu&s;t tell you, that within the&s;e few days pa&s;t, &s;everal learned Doctors of this Univer&s;ity came to be informed by me, of the method I take in my diet, having under&s;tood that I am &s;till healthful and &s;trong; that I have my &s;en&s;es perfect; that my me|mory, my heart, my judgment, the tone of my voice, and my teeth, are all as &s;ound as in my youth; that I write &s;even or eight hours a day, and &s;pend the re&s;t of the day in walking out a-foot, and in taking all the innocent plea&s;ures that are
<PB N="54" REF="030282_0058_0FE59EE09F6EF770">
allowed to a virtuous man; even mu|&s;ic it&s;elf in which I hear my part.</P>
<P>AH, Sir! how &s;weet a voice would you perceive mine to be, were you to hear me, like another <HI>David,</HI> chant forth the prai&s;es of GOD to the found of my Lyre! You would certainly be &s;urpri&s;ed and charmed with the harmony which I make. Tho&s;e gentlemen particularly admired, with what ea&s;ine&s;s I write on &s;ubjects that require both judgment and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THEY told me, that I ought not to be looked on as an old man, &s;ince all my employments were &s;uch as were proper for a youth, and did by no means re&s;em|ble the works of men advanced in years; who are capable of doing nothing after four&s;core, but loaded with infirmities and di&s;tempers, are perpetually langui&s;hing in pain, not half &s;o chearful, plea&s;ant and happy as I am.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="030282_0059_0FE59F3AF7050988">
SEVERAL phy&s;icians were &s;o good as to progno&s;ticate to me, ten years ago, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to hold out three years longer: however, I &s;till find my&s;elf le&s;s weak than ever, and am &s;tronger this year than any that went be|fore. This &s;ort of miracle, and the ma|ny favours which I received from GOD, obliged them to tell me, that I brought along with me at my birth, an extraor|dinary and &s;pecial gift of nature; and for the proof their opinion, they em|ployed all their rhetoric, and made &s;eve|ral elegant &s;peeches on that head. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, my Lord, that eloquence has a charming force on the mind of man, &s;ince it often per&s;uades him to believe that which never was, and never could be. I was very much plea&s;ed to hear them di&s;cour&s;e; and could it be helped, &s;ince they were men of parts who harangued at that rate? But that which delighted me mo&s;t,
<PB N="56" REF="030282_0060_0FE59F4C0D47C7C0">
was to reflect, that age and experience may render a man wi&s;er than all the col|leges in the world can. And it was in truth by their help, that I knew the er|ror of that notion. To undeceive tho&s;e gentlemen, and at the &s;ame time &s;et them right, I replied, that their way of arguing was not ju&s;t: that the favour I received was no &s;pecial, but a general and univer&s;al one: that I was but a man as well as others: that we have all judgment and rea&s;on, which the Creator has be&s;towed on us to pre&s;erve our lives: that man, when young, being more &s;ubject to &s;en&s;e than rea&s;on, is too apt to give him&s;elf up to plea&s;ure; and that when arrived to thirty or forty years of age, he ought to con&s;ider, that, if he has been &s;o imprudent as to lead, till that time, a di&s;orderly life, it is now high time for him to take up and live temperately; for he ought to remember, that though he has hitherto been held up by the vigour of
<PB N="57" REF="030282_0061_0FE59EE2343F9858">
youth and a good con&s;titution, yet he is now at the noon of life, and mu&s;t bethink him&s;elf of going down towards the grave, with a heavy weight of years on his back, of which his frequent pains and infirmities are certain forerunners; and that there|fore, if he has not been &s;o happy as to do it already, he ought now, immedi|ately to change his cour&s;e of life</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, it was not without great reluctance that I abandoned my luxurious way of living. I began with praying to GOD, that he would grant me the gift of Temperance, well knowing that he always hears our prayers with de|light. Then, con&s;idering, that when a man is about to undertake any thing of importance, he may greatly &s;trengthen him&s;elf in it, by often looking forward to the great plea&s;ures and advantages that he is to derive from it. Ju&s;t as the hu&s;bandman takes comfort under his toils, by reflecting on the &s;weets of abun|dance;
<PB N="58" REF="030282_0062_0FE59EE4743697A8">
and as the good chri&s;tian glad|dens in the &s;ervice of GOD, when he thinks on the glory of that &s;ervice, and the eternal joys that await him; &s;o I, in like manner, by &s;eriou&s;ly reflecting on the innumerable plea&s;ures and ble&s;&s;ings of health, and be&s;eeching GOD to &s;trengthen me in my good re&s;olutions, immediately entered on a cour&s;e of temperance and re|gularity. And though it was at fir&s;t highly di&s;agreeable, yet I can truly &s;ay, that in a very little time, the di&s;agreeablene&s;s vani&s;hed, and I came to find great de|light in it.</P>
<P>Now on hearing my arguments, they all agreed that I had &s;aid nothing but what was rea&s;onable; nay, the younge&s;t among them told me, that he was will|ing to allow that the&s;e advantages might be common to all men, but was afraid, they were &s;eldom attained; and that I mu&s;t be &s;ingularly favoured of Heaven to get above the delights of an ea&s;y life,
<PB N="59" REF="030282_0063_0FE59EE99BCF1848">
and embrace one quite contrary to it; that he did not look on it to be impo&s;|&s;ible, &s;ince my practice convinced him of the contrary, but however, it &s;eemed to him to be very difficult.</P>
<P>I REPLIED, that it was a &s;hame to re|linqui&s;h a good undertaking on account of the difficulties that might attend it, and that the greater the difficulty, the more glory &s;hould we acquire: that it is the will of the Creator, that every one &s;hould attain to a long life, becau&s;e in his old age, he might be freed from the bitter fruits that were produced by &s;en&s;e, and might enjoy the good effects of his rea&s;on; that when he &s;hakes hands with his vices, he is no longer a &s;lave to the devil, and finds him&s;elf in a better con|dition of providing for the &s;alvation of his &s;oul: that GOD, who&s;e goodne&s;s is infinite, has ordained that the man who comes to the end of his race, &s;hould end his life without any di&s;temper, and &s;o
<PB N="60" REF="030282_0064_0FE59EEB382EFEE0">
pa&s;s, by a &s;weet and ea&s;y death, to a life of immortality and glory, which I expect. I hope (&s;aid I to him) to die &s;inging the prai&s;es of my Creator. The &s;ad reflection, that we mu&s;t one day cea&s;e to live, is no di&s;turbance to me, though I ea&s;ily preceive, that at my age, that day cannot be far off; nor am I afraid of the terrors of hell, becau&s;e, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, I have long ago &s;haken hands with my &s;ins, and put my tru&s;t in the mercy and merits of the blood of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>To this my young antagoni&s;t had no|thing to &s;ay, only that he was re&s;olved to lead a &s;ober life, that he might live and die as happily as I hoped to do; and that though hitherto he had wi&s;hed to be young a long time, yet now he de&s;ired to be quickly old, that he might enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;uch an admir|able age.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="030282_0065_0FE59EECCD1B50F0">
SOME &s;en&s;ual per&s;ons give out, that I have troubled my&s;elf to no purpo&s;e, in compo&s;ing a treati&s;e concerning tem|perance, and that I have lo&s;t my time in endeavouring to per&s;uade men to the practice of that which is impo&s;&s;ible. Now this &s;urpri&s;es me the more, as the&s;e gentlemen mu&s;t &s;ee that I had led a temperate life many years before I compo&s;ed this treati&s;e, and that I never &s;hould have put my&s;elf to the trouble of compo&s;ing it, had not long experience convinced me, that it is a life which any man may ea&s;ily lead, who really wi&s;hes to be healthy and happy. And, be&s;ides the evidence of my own experi|ence, I have the &s;atisfaction to hear, that numbers on &s;eeing my treati&s;e have embraced &s;uch a life, and enjoyed from it the very &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings which I enjoy. Hence, I conclude, that no man of good &s;en&s;e will pay any regard to &s;o frivolous an objection. The truth is, tho&s;e gen|tlemen
<PB N="62" REF="030282_0066_0FE59EEF7121BA70">
who make this objection, are &s;o unhappily wedded to the poor plea&s;ure of eating and drinking, that they can|not think of moderating it, and as an excu&s;e for them&s;elves, they choo&s;e to talk at this extravagant rate. How|ever, I pity the&s;e gentlemen with all my heart, though they de&s;erve for their in|temperance, to be tormented with a complication of di&s;tempers, and to be the victims of their pa&s;&s;ions a whole eternity.</P>

<P>WHAT ingratitude &s;hould I be guilty of, did I not return thanks to the divine Goodne&s;s, for all his favors conferred up|on me? Mo&s;t of your old men have &s;carce arrived to &s;ixty, but they find them&s;elves loaded with infirmities: they are melan|choly, unhealthful; always full of the frightful apprehen&s;ions of dying: they tremble day and night for fear of being within one foot of their graves; and are &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the dread of it, that it is a hard matter to divert them from that doleful thought. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, I am free from their ills and ter|rors. It is my opinion, that I ought

not to abandon my&s;elf to that vain fear: this I will make appear by the &s;equel.</P>
<P>SOME there are, who bring along with them a &s;trong con&s;titution into the world, and live to old age: but it is ge|nerally (as already ob&s;erved) an old age of &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow; for which they are to thank them&s;elves; becau&s;e they mo&s;t unrea&s;onably pre&s;ume on the &s;trength of their con&s;titution; and will not on any account, abate of that hearty feed|ing which they indulged in their young|er days. Ju&s;t as if they were to be as vigorous at four&s;core as in the flower of their youth; nay, they go about to ju&s;|tify this their imprudence, pretending that as we lo&s;e our health and vigor by growing old, we &s;hould endeavour to repair the lo&s;s, by increa&s;ing the quanti|ty of our food, &s;ince it is by &s;u&s;tenance that man is pre&s;erved.</P>

<P>THIS is a certain truth, that &s;harp four humours on the &s;tomach, proceed from a &s;low imperfect dige&s;tion; and that but little good chyle can be made, when the &s;tomach is filled with fre&s;h food be|fore it has carried off the former meal.&mdash;It cannot therefore be too frequently, nor too earne&s;tly recommended, that as the natural heat decays by age, a man ought to abate the quantity of what he eats and drinks; nature requiring but very little for the healthy &s;upport of the life of man, e&s;pecially that of an old man. Would my aged friends but attend to this &s;ingle precept which has been &s;o &s;ig|nally &s;erviceable to me, they would not be troubled with one twentieth of tho&s;e

infirmities which now harra&s;s and make their lives &s;o mi&s;erable. They would be light, active, and chearful like me, who am now near my <HI>hundredth year.</HI> And tho&s;e of them who were born with good con&s;titutions, might live to the age of one hundred and twenty. Had I been ble&s;t with a robu&s;t con&s;titution, I &s;hould in all probability, attain the &s;ame age. But as I was born with feeble &s;tamina, I &s;hall not perhaps outlive an hundred. And this moral certainty of living to a great age is to be &s;ure, a mo&s;t plea&s;ing and de|&s;irable attainment, and it is the preroga|tive of none but the temperate. For all tho&s;e who (by immoderate eating and drinking) fill their bodies with gro&s;s hu|mours, can have no rea&s;onable a&s;&s;urance of living a &s;ingle day longer: oppre&s;&s;ed with food and &s;woln with &s;uperfluous hu|mours, they are in continual danger of violent fits of the cholic, deadly &s;trokes of the apoplexy, fatal attacks of the

cholera morbus, burning fevers, and many &s;uch acute and violent di&s;ea&s;es, whereby thou&s;ands are carried to their graves, who a few hours before looked very hale and hearty. And this moral certainty of long life is built on &s;uch good grounds as &s;eldom ever fail. For, generally &s;peaking, Almighty GOD &s;eems to have &s;ettled his works on the &s;ure grounds of natural cau&s;es, and tempe|rance is (by divine appointment) the na|tural cau&s;e of health and long life. Hence it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, that he who leads a &s;trictly temperate life, &s;hould breed any &s;ickne&s;s or die of an unnatural death, before he attains to the years to which the natural &s;trength of his con&s;titution was to arrive. I know &s;ome per&s;ons are &s;o weak as to excu&s;e their wicked intem|perance, by &s;aying, that "the race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong," and that therefore, let them eat and drink as they plea&s;e, they &s;hall
<PB N="68" REF="030282_0072_0FE59F026F865220">
not die till their time comes. How &s;can|dalou&s;ly do the&s;e men mi&s;under&s;tand So|lomon and abu&s;e truth! How would it &s;tartle us to hear our friends &s;ay, "that let them &s;leep and play, as they plea&s;e, they &s;hall not be beggars till their time comes."</P>
<P>SOLOMON does indeed &s;ay, that "the race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong;" but he mu&s;t be no better than a madman, who thence in|fers, that it is not <HI>generally</HI> &s;o. For the invariable and eternal experience of man|kind demon&s;trates, that ninety-nine times in an hundred, the race is to the &s;wift, and the battle to the &s;trong, bread to the indu&s;trious, and health to the tempe|rate.</P>
<P>BUT it is a matter of fact, and not to be denied, that, though temperance has the divine efficacy to &s;ecure us from violent di&s;ea&s;e and unnatural death, yet it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed to make a man immortal. It
<PB N="69" REF="030282_0073_0FE59F048FABB418">
is impo&s;&s;ible but that time, which effaces all things, &s;hould likewi&s;e de&s;troy that mo&s;t curious workman&s;hip of GOD, the human body: but it is man's privilege to end his days by a natural death, that is, without pain and agony, as they will &s;ee me, when the heat and &s;trength of na|ture is quite exhau&s;ted. But I promi&s;e my&s;elf, that day is a pretty comfortable di&s;tance off yet, and I fancy I am not mi&s;taken, becau&s;e I am &s;till healthy and bri&s;k, reli&s;h all I eat, &s;leep quietly, and find no defect in any of my &s;en&s;es. Be|&s;ides, all the faculties of my mind are in the highe&s;t perfection; my under&s;tand|ing clear and bright as ever; my judg|ment &s;ound; my memory tenacious; my &s;pirits good; and my voice, the fir&s;t thing that fails others, &s;till &s;o &s;trong and &s;onorous, that every morning and even|ing, with my dear grand-children around me, I can addre&s;s my prayers and chant the prai&s;es of the Almighty.

glorious this life of mine is like to be, replete with all the felicities which man can enjoy on this &s;ide of the grave; and exempt from that &s;en&s;ual brutality which age has enabled my better rea&s;on to ba|ni&s;h, and therewith all its bitter fruits, the extravagant pa&s;&s;ions and di&s;tre&s;sful perturbations of mind. Nor yet can the fears of death find room in my mind as I have no licen&s;ed &s;ins, to cheri&s;h &s;uch gloomy thoughts: neither can the death of relations and friends give me any o|ther grief than that of the fir&s;t move|ment of nature, which cannot be avoid|ed, but is of no long continuance. Still le&s;s am I liable to be ca&s;t down by the lo&s;s of wordly goods. I look on the&s;e things as the property of heaven; I can thank him for the loan of &s;o many com|forts, and when his wi&s;dom &s;ees fit to withdraw them, I can look on their de|parture without murmuring.&mdash;This is the happine&s;s of tho&s;e only, who grow

old in the ways of temperance and vir|tue; a happine&s;s which &s;eldom attends the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing youth who live in vice. Such are all &s;ubject to a thou&s;and di&s;orders, both of body and mind, from which I am entirely free: on the contra|ry, I enjoy a thou&s;and plea&s;ures, which are as pure as they are calm.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e is to do &s;ervice to my country. O! what a glorious a|mu&s;ement, in which I find infinite de|light, in &s;hewing my countrymen how to fortify this our dear city of Venice, in &s;o excellent a manner, as to make her a famous republic, a rich and matchle&s;s city. Another amu&s;ement of mine is, that of &s;hewing this maid and queen of cities, in what manner &s;he may always abound with provi&s;ions, by manuring untilled lands, draining mar&s;hes, and laying under water, and thereby fatten|ing fields, which had all along been barren for want of moi&s;ture. My third
<PB N="72" REF="030282_0076_0FE59F0D7388E6D0">
amu&s;ement is in &s;hewing my native city, how, though already &s;trong, &s;he may be rendered much &s;tronger; and, tho' extremely beautiful, may &s;till increa&s;e in beauty; though rich, may acquire more wealth, and may be made to en|joy better air, though her air is excel|lent. The&s;e three amu&s;ements, all ari&s;|ing from the idea of public utility, I enjoy in the highe&s;t degree. Another very great comfort I enjoy is, that hav|ing been defrauded when young, of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, I have made ample amends for that lo&s;s, by dint of thought and indu&s;try, and without the lea&s;t wrong done to any per&s;on, have doubled my income, &s;o that I am able not only to provide for my dear grand-children, but to educate and a&s;&s;i&s;t many poor youth to begin the world. And I can|not help &s;aying, I reflect with more plea|&s;ure on what I lay out in that way, than in any other.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="030282_0077_0FE59F0FA31CA1D8">
ANOTHER very con&s;iderable addition to my happine&s;s is, that what I have written from my own experience, in or|der to recommend <HI>temperance,</HI> has been of great u&s;e to numbers, who loudly proclaim their obligations to me for that work, &s;everal of them having &s;ent me word from foreign parts, that, under GOD, they are indebted to me for their lives. But that which makes me look on my&s;elf as one of the happie&s;t of men, is, that I enjoy as it were, two &s;orts of lives; the one terre&s;trial, which I po&s;|&s;e&s;s in fact; the other cele&s;tial, which I po&s;&s;e&s;s in thought; and this thought is attended with unutterable delight, being founded on &s;uch glorious objects, which I am morally &s;ure of obtaining, through the infinite goodne&s;s and mercy of GOD. Thus I enjoy this terre&s;trial life, partly through the beneficent influences of tem|perance and &s;obriety, virtues &s;o plea&s;ing to heaven; and I enjoy, through cordi|al
<PB N="74" REF="030282_0078_0FE59F11353137D0">
love of the &s;ame divine Maje&s;ty, the cele&s;tial life, by contemplating &s;o often on the happine&s;s thereof, that I can hardly think of any thing el&s;e. And I hold, that dying in the manner I ex|pect, is not really death, but a pa&s;&s;age of the &s;oul from this earthly life, to a cele&s;tial, immortal, and infinitely per|fect exi&s;tence. And I am &s;o far charm|ed with the glorious elevation to which I think my &s;oul is de&s;igned, that I can no longer &s;toop to tho&s;e trifles, which, alas! charm and infatuate too great a part of mankind. The pro&s;pect of part|ing with my favourite enjoyments of this life, gives me but little concern; on the contrary, I thank GOD, I often think of it with &s;ecret joy, &s;ince by that lo&s;s I am to gain a life incomparably more happy.</P>
<P>O! WHO then would be troubled, were he in my place? what good man, but mu&s;t in&s;tantly throw off his load of
<PB N="75" REF="030282_0079_0FE59F15010DAB28">
worldly &s;orrow, and addre&s;s his grateful homage to the Author of all this happi|ne&s;s? However, there is not a man on earth, who may not hope for the like happine&s;s, if he would but live as I do. For indeed I am no angel, but only a man, a &s;ervant of GOD, to whom a good and temperate life is &s;o plea&s;ing, that even in this world he greatly re|wards tho&s;e who practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>AND whereas many embrace a holy and contemplative life, teaching and preaching the great truths of religion, which is <HI>highly</HI> commendable, the chief employment of &s;uch being to lead men to the knowledge and wor&s;hip of GOD. O that they would likewi&s;e betake them|&s;elves entirely to a regular and temperate life! They would then be con&s;idered as &s;aints indeed upon earth, as tho&s;e pri|mitive chri&s;tians were, who ob&s;erved &s;o con&s;tant a temperance, and lived &s;o long. By living like them, to the age of one
<PB N="76" REF="030282_0080_0FE59F17FB0DBCA0">
hundred and twenty, they might make &s;uch a proficiency in holine&s;s, and be|come &s;o dear to GOD, as to do the great|e&s;t honour and &s;ervice to the world; and they would be&s;ides, enjoy con&s;tant health and &s;pirits, and be always happy with|in them&s;elves; whereas they are now too often infirm and melancholy. If in|deed they are melancholy, becau&s;e they &s;ee GOD, (after all his goodne&s;s) &s;o un|gratefully requitted; or becau&s;e they &s;ee men (notwith&s;tanding their in|numerable obligations to love) yet hat|ing and grieving each other: &s;uch me|lancholy is truly amiable and divine.</P>
<P>BUT to be melancholy on any other account, is, to &s;peak the truth, quite unnatural to good chri&s;tians; &s;uch per|&s;ons being the &s;ervants of GOD and heirs of immortality; and it is &s;till more un|becoming the mini&s;ters of religion, who ought to con&s;ider them&s;elves, as of all
<PB N="77" REF="030282_0081_0FE59F1A19BFC048">
others, in the mo&s;t important, &s;ervice|able, and delightful employment.</P>
<P>I KNOW, many of the&s;e gentlemen think that GOD does purpo&s;ely bring the&s;e occa&s;ions of melancholy on them that they may in this life do penance for their former &s;ins; but therein, as I think, they are much mi&s;taken. I can|not conceive, how GOD, who loves mankind, can be delighted with their &s;ufferings. He de&s;ires that mankind &s;hould be happy, both in this world and the next; he tells us &s;o in a thou&s;and places in his word, and we actually find that there is not a man on earth, who does not feel the good Spirit of GOD, forbidding and condemning tho&s;e wick|ed cour&s;es, which would rob him of that happine&s;s. No; it is the devil and &s;in which bring all the evils we &s;uffer, on our heads, and not GOD, who is our Creator and Father, and de&s;ires our hap|pine&s;s: his commands tend to no other

purpo&s;e. And temperance would not be a virtue, if the benefit it does us by pre&s;erving us from di&s;tempers, were re|pugnant to the de&s;igns of GOD in our old age.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, if all religious people were &s;trictly temperate and holy, how beauti|ful, how glorious a &s;cene &s;hould we then behold! Such numbers of vener|able old men as would create &s;urpri&s;e. How many wi&s;e and holy teachers to edify the people by their whole&s;ome preaching and good examples! How many &s;inners might receive benefit by their fervent interce&s;&s;ions! How many ble&s;&s;ings might they &s;hower upon the earth! and not as now, eating and drinking &s;o intemperately, as to inflame the blood and excite worldly pa&s;&s;ions, pride, ambition, and concupi&s;cence, &s;oiling the purity of their minds, check|ing their growth in holine&s;s, and in &s;ome unguarded moment, betraying
<PB N="79" REF="030282_0083_0FE59F1F6CBA2260">
them into &s;ins di&s;graceful to religion, and ruinous to their peace for life.&mdash;Would they but feed temperately, and that chiefly on vegetable food, they would as I do, &s;oon find it the mo&s;t agreeable, (by the cool temperate hu|mours it affords) the be&s;t friend to vir|tuous improvement, begetting gentle manners, mild affections, purity of thought, heavenly mindedne&s;s, quick reli&s;h of virtue, and delight in GOD. This was the life led by the holy fathers of old, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted entirely on vege|tables, drinking nothing but pure water, and yet lived to an extreme old age, in good health and &s;pirits, and always happy within them&s;elves. And &s;o may all in our days live, provided they would but mortify the lu&s;ts of a corrup|tible body, and devote them&s;elves en|tirely to the exalted &s;ervice of GOD; for this is indeed the privilege of every faithful chri&s;tian as Je&s;us Chri&s;t left it,

when he came down upon earth to &s;hed his precious blood, in order to deliver us from the tyrannical &s;ervitude of the devil; and all through his immen&s;e goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>TO conclude, &s;ince length of days abounds with &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings, and I am &s;o happy as to have arrived at that &s;tate, I find my&s;elf bound (in charity) to give te&s;timony in favour of it, and &s;o|lemnly a&s;&s;ure all mankind, that I really enjoy a great deal more than what I now mention; and that I have no other motive in writing on this &s;ubject, than to engage them to practi&s;e, all their lives, tho&s;e excellent virtues of tempe|rance and &s;obriety, which will bring them, like me, to a happy old age. And therefore I never cea&s;e to rai&s;e my voice, crying out to you, my friends, may your days be many, that you may long &s;erve GOD, and be fitter for the glo|ry which he prepares for his children!</P>

<P><HI>THERE is &s;carcely among the evils of life, any &s;o generally dreaded as poverty. Many other kinds of mi&s;ery a man may ea&s;ily forget, becau&s;e they do not always force them&s;elves upon his regards. But it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s a day or an hour, in the company of men without &s;eeing how much poverty is expo&s;ed to neglect and in&s;ult; and in its</HI> lowe&s;t <HI>&s;tate, to hunger and</HI>

<HI>nakedne&s;s; to injuries, again&s;t which, every pa&s;&s;ion is in arms; and to wants, which nature, without the aids of religi|on, cannot &s;u&s;tain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>OF the&s;e calamities, mankind in general &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible. We hear on every &s;ide the noi&s;e of trade; and &s;ee the &s;treets thronged with numberle&s;s multitudes, who&s;e faces are clouded with anxiety, and who&s;e &s;teps are hurried by precipitation, from no other motive than the hope of gain. The whole world is put in motion by the de&s;ire of that wealth, which is chiefly to be va|lued as it &s;ecures us from poverty and its mi&s;eries. But there are always &s;ome who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions or follies lead them to a con|duct widely different from the general prac|tice of mankind. I mean the thoughtle&s;s and the negligent, who, from an exce&s;s of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or the &s;eductions of company, indulge habits of plea&s;ure and expence above their fortunes; and thus mi&s;pend their time, or wa&s;te the inheritance of</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="030282_0102_0FE5986836475708">
<HI>their fathers, without ever &s;eeming to re|flect on the great &s;acrifice they are making, or the gulph to which they approach, till poverty, like an unexpected winter, comes upon them with all its chilling calamities, and awakens them to a pungent &s;en&s;e of their folly and wretchedne&s;s. The young, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t generous and un&s;u&s;|pecting tempers, often fall into this evil net, out of which they &s;eldom e&s;cape with|out &s;uffering injuries, which they painfully feel and &s;eriou&s;ly lament through life. No man had a heart more di&s;po&s;ed to pity, nor a head more able to coun&s;el the&s;e</HI> unfortu|nates, <HI>than the &s;age</HI> Dr. FRANKLIN, <HI>the friend of man, and the great economi&s;t of</HI> AMERICA. <HI>His little work, entitled,</HI> "THE WAY TO WEALTH," <HI>is uni|ver&s;ally con&s;idered as a ma&s;ter-piece, on the art of making and pre&s;erving a for|tune. But before we give the Reader a &s;ight of this, we will exhibit to his view &s;ome of the many felicities of wealth, that</HI>

<HI>on &s;eeing how much happine&s;s he may de|rive from it to him&s;elf, and how many &s;er|vices he may therewith confer on others, he may apply with vigor and per&s;everance to the means conducive to &s;o de&s;ireable an end.</HI></P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place&mdash;<HI>WEALTH always commands re&s;pect, unle&s;s its owner be an infamous wretch indeed; and even in that deplorable ca&s;e, it has the magic powers of charity, to cover and hide a multitude of fins. It gives a man an air of con&s;equence, and like true beauty, without any exertion of its own, wins the favour of all behold|ers. When the rich man goes into compa|ny, every body ri&s;e up to &s;alute him: no features too hard to a&s;&s;ume a &s;mile; no back &s;o &s;tiff but can afford him a bow. He is placed in the uppermo&s;t &s;eat at the table, and men covet to direct their con|ver&s;ation to him.</HI> The poor man &s;peak|eth, but no one regardeth: the rich

openeth his mouth, and lo! &s;ilence is kept.</P>
<P><HI>WHAT can be more plea&s;ing to a man than to &s;ee him&s;elf thus honoured by his friends? But be&s;ides this &s;atisfaction, which to the good, is very exqui&s;ite; it has a very happy moral effect on the mind. In a mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of common &s;en&s;ibility, it mu&s;t kindle the &s;oft fire of good humour, and good humour naturally in&s;pires benevolence and affection. Whence we infer, that a rich man, who is prudent, &s;tands a much fairer chance to be good humoured than the poor, who&s;e poverty expo&s;es them to &s;uch frequent &s;lights and neglects.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place&mdash;<HI>WEALTH places a man in a &s;tate which all mu&s;t covet; a &s;tate of INDEPENDENCE.</HI> To owe no man any thing; <HI>to be able to go wither-&s;oever we plea&s;e; and to face any company without dread of dunning, is a luxury too divine, even to be</HI> conceived <HI>by any who have not been haunted and hag ridden by</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="030282_0105_0FE598E5D3E955F8">
<HI>creditors. Say, ye debtors, ye poore&s;t of mankind, &s;ay, ye who cannot look at a creditor without confu&s;ion, nor hear the name of ju&s;tice without a pang; who &s;tartle at the</HI> &s;ound of a &s;haken leaf, <HI>as though the feet of the &s;heriff were at the door, and fly as the murderer flies from the avenger of blood, who&s;e &s;orrowful days are wa&s;ted in meditating fruitle&s;s plans of payment, while your midnight &s;lumbers are frightened by dreams of bankruptcy, and apparitions of mercile&s;s creditors, &s;ales, and hou&s;ele&s;s children: &s;ay, wherein is the life of a debtor better than the life of a dog. Are not the pro&s;pects of independence as reviving to your hearts, as the pro&s;pects of paradi&s;e to &s;ouls that have long pined in purgatory?</HI></P>
<P><HI>BUT, on the other hand, never to go in debt; or, if accident &s;hould render a trifl|ing debt nece&s;&s;ary; to have at home more than enough to defray it; to receive a cre|ditor with a &s;miling countenance; to de|light</HI>

<P><HI>To a tender parent, the intere&s;ts of his children are dear, as the blood which feeds the fountain of life.

<P><HI>To take by the hand poor young trade&s;|men; to lend them money; to &s;et them up, and thus to enable them to be very u&s;eful to the community, and to make comfort|able livings for them&s;elves.</HI></P>

<P>I HAVE heard, that nothing gives an author &s;o great plea&s;ure, as to find his works re&s;pectfully quoted by others. Judge, then, how much I mu&s;t have been gratified by an incident I am go|ing to relate to you. I &s;topped my hor&s;e, lately, where a great number of people were collected at an auction of merchant's goods. The hour of the &s;ale not being come, they were conver&s;ing on the badne&s;s of the times; and one of the company called to a plain, clean

old man, with white locks, "Pray: father, Abraham, what think you of the times? Will not the&s;e heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How &s;hall we be ever able to pay them? What would you advi&s;e us to?"&mdash;Father Abraham, &s;tood up, and replied, "If you would have my advice, I will give it you in &s;hort; "for a word to the wi&s;e is e|nough," as Poor Richard &s;ays." They joined in de&s;iring him to &s;peak his mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>"FRIENDS, &s;ays he, the taxes are, indeed, very heavy; and, if tho&s;e laid on by the government, were the only ones we had to pay, we might more ea&s;ily di&s;charge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to &s;ome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idlene&s;s, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from the&s;e

taxes the commi&s;&s;ioners cannot ea&s;e or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good ad|vice, and &s;omething may be done for us; God helps them that help them|&s;elves," as Poor Richard &s;ays.</P>
<P>I. "IT would be thought a hard go|vernment that &s;hould tax its people one-tenth part of their time, to be employ|ed in its &s;ervice: but idlene&s;s taxes many of us much more; &s;loth, by bringing on di&s;ea&s;es, ab&s;olutely &s;hortens life. "Sloth, like ru&s;t, con&s;umes fa&s;|ter than labour wears, while the u&s;ed key is always bright," as Poor Richard &s;ays. "But do&s;t thou love life, then do not &s;quander time, for that is the &s;tuff life is made of," as Poor Richard &s;ays. How much more than is nece&s;&s;a|ry do we &s;pend in &s;leep? forgetting that "The &s;leeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be &s;leeping enough in the grave," as Poor Richard &s;ays.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="030282_0112_0FE59F4E4867F270">
"If time be of all things the mo&s;t precious, wa&s;ting time mu&s;t be," as Poor Richard &s;ays, "the greate&s;t pro|digality;" &s;ince, as he el&s;ewhere tells us, "Lo&s;t time is never found again; and what we call time enough always proves little enough:" Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the pur|po&s;e; &s;o by diligence &s;hall we do more with le&s;s perplexity. "Sloth makes all things difficult, but indu&s;try all ea&s;y; and, he that ri&s;eth late, mu&s;t trot all day, and &s;hall &s;carce overtake his bu|&s;ine&s;s at night; while lazine&s;s travels &s;o &s;lowly, that poverty &s;oon overtakes him. Drive thy bu&s;ine&s;s, let not that drive thee; and early to bed and early to ri&s;e, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wi&s;e," as Poor Richard &s;ays.</P>
<P>"So what &s;ignifies wi&s;hing and hop|ing for better times? We may make the&s;e times better, if we be&s;tir our&s;elves. "Indu&s;try need not wi&s;h, and he that

lives upon hope will die fa&s;ting. There are no gains without pains; then, help hands for I have no lands," or if I have they are &s;martly taxed. "He that hath a trade, hath an e&s;tate; and he that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and honour," as Poor Richard &s;ays; but then the trade mu&s;t be work|ed at, and the calling well followed, or neither the e&s;tate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are indu&s;trious, we will never &s;tarve; for at the working man's hou&s;e, hunger looks in, but dares not enter." Nor will the bailiff or the con&s;table enter, for "Indu&s;try pays debts, while de|&s;pair increa&s;eth them." What, though you have found no trea&s;ure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy, "Di|ligence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things to indu&s;try. Then plough deep, while &s;luggards &s;leep, and you &s;hall have corn to &s;ell and to keep."
<PB N="112" REF="030282_0114_0FE59F5356E7AD90">
Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hin|dered to-morrow. "One to-day is worth two to-morrows," as Poor Rich|ard &s;ays; and farther, "Never leave that till to-morrow, which you can do to-day." If you were a &s;ervant, would you not be a&s;hamed that a good ma&s;ter &s;hould catch you idle? Are you then your own ma&s;ter? be a&s;hamed to catch your&s;elf idle, when there is &s;o much to be done for your&s;elf, your family, your relations, and your country. Handle your tools without mittens: remember, that "The cat in gloves catches no mice," as Poor Richard &s;ays. It is true, there is much to be done, and, perhaps, you are weak-handed; but &s;tick to it &s;teadily, and you will &s;ee great effects; for "Con&s;tant dropping wears away &s;tones; and by diligence and patience the mou&s;e ate in two the cable; and little &s;trokes fell great oaks."</P>

Lei&s;ure is time for doing &s;omething u&s;eful; this lei&s;ure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; for, "A life of lei&s;ure and a life of lazine&s;s are two things. Many, without labour would live by their wits only, but they break for want of &s;tock;" whereas indu&s;try gives comfort, and plenty, and re&s;pect. "Fly plea&s;ures, and they will follow you.

<L>That throve &s;o well as tho&s;e that fettled be."</L></Q>
"And again, "Three removes is as bad as a fire;" and again, "Keep thy &s;hop, and thy &s;hop will keep thee;" and again, "If you would have your bu&s;ine&s;s done, go; if not, &s;end." And again,
<Q><L>"He that by the plough would thrive,</L>
<L>Him&s;elf mu&s;t either hold or drive."</L></Q>
"And again, "The eye of a ma&s;ter will do more work than both his hands;" and again, "Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge;" and again, "Not to over&s;ee workmen, is to leave them your pur&s;e open." Tru&s;ting too much to others care is the ruin of many; for, "In the affairs of this world, men are &s;aved, not by faith, but by the want of it;" but a man's
<PB N="115" REF="030282_0117_0FE59F5A04F82FB0">
own care is profitable; for, "If you would have a faithful &s;ervant, and one that you like, &s;erve your&s;elf. A little neglect may breed great mi&s;chief; for want of a nail the &s;hoe was lo&s;t; for want of a &s;hoe the hor&s;e was lo&s;t; and for want of a hor&s;e the rider was lo&s;t," being overtaken and &s;lain by the enemy; all for want of a little care about a hor&s;e-&s;hoe nail.</P>
<P>III. "So much for indu&s;try my friends, and attention to one's own bu|&s;ine&s;s; but to the&s;e we mu&s;t add fruga|lity, if we would make our indu&s;try more certainly &s;ucce&s;sful. A man may, if he knows not how to &s;ave as he gets, "keep his no&s;e all his life to the grind|&s;tone, and die not worth a groat at la&s;t. A fat kitchen makes a lean will;" and
<Q><L>"Many e&s;tates are &s;pent in the getting,</L>
<L>Since women for tea for&s;ook &s;pinning &amp; knitting,</L>
<L>And men for punch for&s;ook hewing and &s;plitting."</L></Q>
"If you would be wealthy, think of &s;aving, as well as of getting. The In|dies
<PB N="116" REF="030282_0118_0FE59F5E83901FE8">
have not made Spain rich, be|cau&s;e her outgoes are greater than her incomes."</P>
<P>"AWAY, then, with your expen&s;ive follies, and you will not then have &s;o much cau&s;e to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable families; for
<Q><L>"Women and wine, game and deceit,</L>
<L>Makes the wealth &s;mall, and the want great."</L></Q>
And farther, "What maintains one vice, would bring up two children." You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little more co&s;tly, cloaths a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember many a little makes a mickle." Beware of little expences; "A &s;mall leak will &s;ink a great &s;hip," as Poor Richard &s;ays; and again, "Who dain|ties love, &s;hall beggars prove?" and moreover, "Fools make fea&s;ts, and wi&s;e men eat them." Here you are all got together to this &s;ale of fineries and
<PB N="117" REF="030282_0119_0FE59F601570B948">
nick-nacks. You call them goods; but if you do not take care, they will prove evils to &s;ome of you. You expect they will be &s;old cheap, and, perhaps, they may for le&s;s than they co&s;t; but, if you have no occa&s;ion for them, they mu&s;t be dear to you. Remember what Poor Richard &s;ays, "Buy what thou ha&s;t no need of, and ere long thou &s;halt &s;ell thy nece&s;&s;aries." And again, "At a great pennyworth pau&s;e a while:" he means, that perhaps the cheapne&s;s is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain, by &s;traitening thee in thy bu&s;i|ne&s;s, may do the more harm than good. For in another place he &s;ays, "Many have been ruined by buying good pen|nyworths." Again, "It is fooli&s;h to lay out money in a purcha&s;e of repent|ance;" and yet this folly is practi&s;ed every day at auctions, for want of mind|ing the Almanack. Many a one, for the &s;ake of finery on the back, have
<PB N="118" REF="030282_0120_0FE59F6245E3BC78">
gone with a hungry belly, and half &s;tarved their families; "Silks and &s;at|tins, &s;carlet and velvets, put out the kitchen fire," as Poor Richard &s;ays. The&s;e are not the nece&s;&s;aries of life, they can &s;carcely be called the conve|niencies: and yet only becau&s;e they look pretty, how many want to have them? By the&s;e and other extravagan|cies, the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of tho&s;e whom they formerly de&s;pi&s;ed, but who, thro' indu&s;try and frugality, have maintained their &s;tanding; in which ca&s;e it appears plainly, that a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees," as Poor Richard &s;ays. Perhaps they have had a &s;mall e&s;tate left them, which they knew not the getting of: they think "It is day, and will never be night:" that a little to be &s;pent out of &s;o much is not worth minding; but always taking out of the meal-tub, and
<PB N="119" REF="030282_0121_0FE59F63D9FA8EF8">
never putting in, &s;oon comes to the bottom," as Poor Richard &s;ays; and then, "When the well is dry, they know the worth of water." But this they might have known before, if they had taken his advice. "If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow &s;ome; for he that goes a borrowing goes a &s;orrowing," as Poor Richard &s;ays; and, indeed, &s;o does he that lends to &s;uch people, when he goes to get in again. Poor Dick farther ad|vi&s;es, and &s;ays,
<Q><L>"Fond pride of dre&s;s is &s;ure a very cur&s;e;</L>
<L>Ere fancy you con&s;ult, con&s;ult your pur&s;e."</L></Q>
And again, "Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more &s;aucy." When you have bought one fine thing, you mu&s;t buy ten more, that your ap|pearance may be all of a piece; but Poor Dick &s;ays, "It is ea&s;ier to &s;up|pre&s;s the fir&s;t de&s;ire, than to &s;atisfy all that follow it:" And it is as truly folly
<PB N="120" REF="030282_0122_0FE59F68761B41E0">
for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to &s;well, in order to equal the ox.
<Q><L>"Ve&s;&s;els large may venture more,</L>
<L>But little boats &s;hould keep near &s;hore."</L></Q>
It is, however, a folly &s;oon puni&s;hed; for, as Poor Richard &s;ays, "Pride that dines on vanity, &s;ups on contempt; Pride breakfa&s;ted with Plenty, dined with Poverty, and &s;upped with Infamy." And, after all, of what u&s;e is this pride of appearance for which &s;o much is ri&s;k|ed, &s;o much is &s;uffered? It cannot pro|mote health, nor ea&s;e pain; it makes no increa&s;e of merit in the per&s;on, it creates envy, it ha&s;tens misfortune.</P>
<P>"But what madne&s;s mu&s;t it be to run in debt for the&s;e &s;uperfluities? We are offered, by the terms of this &s;ale, &s;ix months credit; and that, perhaps, has induced &s;ome of us to attend it, becau&s;e we cannot &s;pare the ready mo|ney, and hope now to be fine without it. But, ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another
<PB N="121" REF="030282_0123_0FE59F6A0EA4A070">
power over your liberty. If you can|not pay at the time, you will be a&s;ham|ed to &s;ee your creditor; you will be in fear when you &s;peak to him; you will make poor pitiful &s;neaking excu&s;es, and by degrees, come to lo&s;e your veracity, and &s;ink into ba&s;e downright lying; for, "The &s;econd vice is lying, the fir&s;t is running in debt," as Poor Richard &s;ays; and again, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, "Ly|ing rides upon Debt's back:" whereas a free American ought not to be a&s;ham|ed, nor afraid to &s;ee or &s;peak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all &s;pirit and virtue. "It is hard for an empty bag to &s;tand up|right." What would you think of that nation, or of that government, who &s;hould i&s;&s;ue an edict, forbidding you to dre&s;s like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of impri&s;onment or &s;ervitude? Would you not &s;ay, that you were free, have a right to dre&s;s as you plea&s;e, and
<PB N="122" REF="030282_0124_0FE59F6C493D3048">
that &s;uch an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and &s;uch a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put your&s;elf under that tyranny when you run in debt for &s;uch dre&s;s! Your creditor has authority, at his plea&s;ure, to deprive you of your liberty, by con|fining you in gaol for life, or by &s;elling you for a &s;ervant, if you &s;hould not be able to pay him: when you have got your bargain, you may perhaps think little of payment; but as Poor Richard &s;ays, "Creditors have better memories than debtors, creditors are a &s;uper&s;titi|ous &s;ect, great ob&s;ervers of &s;et days and times." The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared to &s;atisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term, which at fir&s;t &s;eemed &s;o long, will, as it le&s;&s;ens, appear extremely &s;hort: Time will &s;eem to have added wings to his heels as well as his &s;houlders. "Tho&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="030282_0125_0FE59F6E74277890">
have a &s;hort Lent, who owe money to be paid at Ea&s;ter." At pre&s;ent, per|haps, you may think your&s;elves in thriv|ing circum&s;tances, and that you can bear a little extravagance without in|jury; but
<Q><L>"For age and want &s;ave while you may,</L>
<L>No morning-&s;un la&s;ts a whole day."</L></Q></P>
<P>GAIN may be temporary and uncer|tain, but ever, while you live, expence is con&s;tant and uncertain; and, "It is ea|&s;ier to build two chimneys, than to keep one in fuel," as Poor Richard &s;ays: So, "Rather go to bed &s;upperle&s;s, than ri&s;e in debt.</P>
<LG>
<L>" Get what you can, and what you get hold,</L>
<L>'Tis the &s;tone that will turn all your lead into gold."</L>
</LG>
<P>AND when you have got the philo&s;o|pher's &s;tone, &s;ure you will no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.</P>
<P>IV. "THIS doctrine, my friends, is rea&s;on and wi&s;dom: but, after all, do not depend too much upon your own

indu&s;try and frugality, and prudence, though excellent things; for they may all be bla&s;ted, without the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven; and therefore, a&s;k that ble&s;|&s;ing humbly, and be not uncharitable to tho&s;e that at pre&s;ent &s;eem to want it, but comfort and help them. Remem|ber, Job &s;uffered, and was afterwards pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>"AND now to conclude, "Experi|ence keeps a dear &s;chool, but fools will learn in no other," as Poor Richard &s;ays, and &s;carce in that; for, it is true, "We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct:" However remember this, "They that will not be coun&s;elled can|not be helped;" and farther, that "If you will not hear Rea&s;on, &s;he will &s;ure|ly rap your knuckles," as Poor Richard &s;ays.</P>
<P>THUS the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it, and approved the doctrine, and immediately

practi&s;ed the contrary, ju&s;t as if it had been a common &s;ermon; for the auc|tion opened, and they began to buy extravagantly. I found the good man had thoroughly &s;tudied my Almanacks, and dige&s;ted all I had dropt on tho&s;e topics during the cour&s;e of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he made of me mu&s;t have tired any one el&s;e; but my vanity was wonderfully delight|ed with it, though I was con&s;cious, that not a tenth part of the wi&s;dom was my own, which he a&s;cribed to me; but ra|ther the gleanings that I had made of the &s;en&s;e of all ages and nations. How|ever, I re&s;olved to be the better for the echo of it; and, though I had at fir&s;t determined to buy &s;tuff for a new coat, I went away, re&s;olved to wear my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the &s;ame, thy profit will be as great as mine. I am, as ever, thine to &s;erve thee.</P>

<HEAD>ADVICE TO A YOUNG TRADESMAN.</HEAD>
<P>REMEMBER that <HI>time</HI> is money. He that can earn ten &s;hillings a day by his labour, and goes abroad, or &s;its idle one half of that day, though he &s;pends but &s;ixpence during his diver&s;ion or idlene&s;s, ought not to reckon that the only expence; he has really &s;pent, or rather thrown away, five &s;hillings be&s;ides.</P>
<P>REMEMBER that credit is money. If a man lets his money lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the intere&s;t, or &s;o much as I can make of it during
<PB N="127" REF="030282_0129_0FE59F799155C650">
that time. This amounts to a con&s;ider|able &s;um when a man has good and large credit, and makes good u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>REMEMBER that money is of a pro|lific generating nature. Money can be|get money, and its offspring can beget more, and &s;o on. Five &s;hillings turned is &s;ix; turned again, it is &s;even and three pence; and &s;o on till it becomes an hun|dred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces, every turning, &s;o that the profits ri&s;e quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding &s;ow, de&s;troys all her offspring to the thou&s;andth genera|tion. He that murders a crown, de|&s;troys all that it might have produced, even &s;cores of pounds.</P>
<P>REMEMBER that &s;ix pounds a year is but a groat a day. For this little &s;um, which may be daily wa&s;ted either in time or expence, unperceived, a man of cre|dit may, on his own &s;ecurity, have the con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and u&s;e of an hun|dred
<PB N="128" REF="030282_0130_0FE59F7FAAC87BF0">
pounds. So much in &s;tock, bri&s;k|ly turned by an indu&s;trious man, produ|ces great advantage.</P>
<P>REMEMBER this &s;aying, "The good payma&s;ter is lord of another man's pur&s;e." He that is known to pay punc|tually and exactly to the time he pro|mi&s;es, may at any time, and on any oc|ca&s;ion, rai&s;e all the money his friends can &s;pare. This is &s;ometimes of great u&s;e. After indu&s;try and frugality, no|thing contributes more to the rai&s;ing of a young man in the world, than punctu|ality and ju&s;tice in all his dealings: there|fore never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you promi&s;ed, le&s;t a di&s;appointment &s;hut up your friend's pur&s;e for ever.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t trifling actions that affect a man's credit are to be regarded. The &s;ound of your hammer at five in the morning, or nine at night, heard by a creditor, makes him ea&s;y &s;ix months
<PB N="129" REF="030282_0131_0FE59F81870E4A28">
longer; but if he &s;ees you at a billiard table, or hears your voice at a tavern, when you &s;hould be at work, he &s;ends for his money the next day; demands it before he can receive it in a lump.</P>
<P>IT &s;hews, be&s;ides, that you are mind|ful of what you owe; it makes you ap|pear a careful, as well as hone&s;t man, and that &s;till increa&s;es your credit.</P>
<P>BEWARE of thinking all your own that you po&s;&s;e&s;s, and of living accord|ingly. It is a mi&s;take that many people who have credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact account, for &s;ome time, both of your expences and your income. If you take the pains at fir&s;t to mention particulars, it will have this good effect; you will di&s;cover how wonderfully &s;mall trifling expences mount up to large &s;ums, and will di&s;cern what might have been, and may for the fu|ture be &s;aved, without occa&s;ioning any great inconvenience.</P>

IN &s;hort, the way to wealth, if you de&s;ire it, is as plain as the way to mar|ket.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF there be any truth fully a&s;certain|ed by rea&s;on and revelation, it is this, That "<HI>Man is not but to be happy.</HI>" Surely the mighty author of our being can have no &s;elfi&s;h view in our creation. His happine&s;s is too immen&s;e and too &s;ecure to receive increa&s;e, or to &s;uffer diminution from any thing that we can do. "<HI>Can a man profit his Maker, or what need hath the Almighty of our &s;er|vices?</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="030282_0135_0FE59F8A90FCB970">
A MORE important que&s;tion claims our regard. Wherein <HI>con&s;i&s;ts</HI> the hap|pine&s;s of Man?</P>
<P>IN order to an&s;wer this, we mu&s;t re|member, that man is compo&s;ed of two natures, an animal and a rational, each of which is ble&s;t with capacities of en|joyment, and mu&s;t have its corre&s;pon|dent objects of gratification before man can be happy. Hitherto we have con|&s;idered him in the fir&s;t of the&s;e, in his animal capacity: We have placed be|fore us, <HI>a creature of noble &s;hape, erect and fair,</HI> formed of nerves and fibres, and endued with appetites and feelings.</P>
<P>THOUGH this his animal nature be infinitely inferior to his rational, yet &s;ince the happine&s;s of the latter cannot be complete, while the former is de&s;titute of its proper goods, we have devoted the two preceding books to the be&s;t in|tere&s;ts of his animal nature. We have taken the liberty to &s;end him to Old
<PB N="135" REF="030282_0136_0FE59F8C252F93B8">
CORNARO and Dr. FRANKLIN, to hear their excellent lectures on health and competence, which all allow to be two very choice ingredients in the cup of happine&s;s. Nay, &s;ome entertain &s;o high an opinion of the&s;e, as to declare, that if CORNARO and FRANKLIN could in|&s;ure a <HI>quantum &s;ufficit</HI> of them, they would be content, and a&s;k no better happine&s;s than what they could extract from the&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT let it be remembered that this is not the language of the wi&s;e, but of the &s;lothful, and of &s;uch as are pu&s;hed for money, who frequently experien|cing the painfulne&s;s of being dunn|ed, and &s;ometimes ta&s;ting the &s;weets of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, are ready to con|clude, that if they had but money enough; Oh if they had but money enough to retire from the fatigues and vexations of bu&s;ine&s;s, and to &s;pend de|licious days and nights in all the varied
<PB N="136" REF="030282_0137_0FE59F8E38EC99F0">
joys of fea&s;ted &s;en&s;e, <HI>how ble&s;t as the immortal Gods they would be!</HI></P>
<P>AND truly, if man was but a more elegant &s;ort of bea&s;t, and capable of no higher plea&s;ures than tho&s;e of &s;en&s;e, the&s;e Mahometan dreamers might be more than half in the right. In that ca&s;e, health and competence might very well &s;erve our turn; as with the one we might purcha&s;e, and with the other enjoy, all the happine&s;s of which we were capable. But &s;ince God has been &s;o good as to rai&s;e us many degrees above mere animal nature; &s;ince he has together with bodies, given us immor|tal minds, endowed with faculties and affections capable of angelic joys, it follows very delightfully, that another gue&s;s bill of fare mu&s;t be made out for us, than that which would &s;erve Epi|curean hogs.</P>
<P>THOSE gentlemen who are &s;o fond of &s;tinting them&s;elves to mere <HI>bodily</HI> plea|&s;ures,
<PB N="137" REF="030282_0138_0FE59F9209AE2E10">
would do well to remember, that every rank of animated nature mu&s;t have its proper gratifications or be mi|&s;erable. Furni&s;h earth and water to a <HI>plant,</HI> and it &s;hall look green, and flou|ri&s;h like a cedar in Lebanon; but give nothing but this to a <HI>hor&s;e,</HI> and he &s;hall pre&s;ently peri&s;h for want of nutriment. Again, give gra&s;s and water to a hor&s;e, and he &s;hall look plump as pampered &s;peculation; but confine a <HI>man</HI> to gra&s;s and water, and you &s;hall &s;oon write <HI>hic jacet</HI> on his tomb. Thus every link in the great chain of being has its re|&s;pective capacities and enjoyments. Man is favoured with the&s;e in a degree of perfection above all the creatures that we have &s;een. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, harmoni|ou&s;ly blended in him&s;elf, the various excellencies of two different natures; together with a reli&s;h for all the plea&s;ures of the mo&s;t perfect animal, he can boa&s;t capacities equal to the &s;ublime delights
<PB N="138" REF="030282_0139_0FE59F93D9697288">
of cele&s;tial &s;pirits; now to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;o exalted, I had almo&s;t &s;aid &s;o divine a creature as this, can be &s;atisfied with enjoyments that belong to the poore&s;t and meane&s;t part of his nature, were a far greater ab&s;urdity, than to &s;uppo&s;e that an animal of the mo&s;t delicate ta&s;te and &s;en&s;e, can be content with earth and water, the &s;imple nutriment of a plant.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find that experi|ence has ever evinced the mi&s;take of tho&s;e, who have expected, that &s;en&s;ual goods <HI>alone</HI> could make them happy. This is not a novel opinion, but &s;eems to have been a favourite notion of &s;ome in the days of King Solomon, who re|&s;olved to examine the truth or fal&s;ehood of it. Never man enjoyed equal opportu|nities; he had gold and &s;ilver as the &s;tones in the vallies for abundance; and in wi&s;|dom he far exceeded all the &s;ages of the Ea&s;t.

<P>CAST your eyes on that pale bloated figure.

Some|times he was mortified, becau&s;e, through defect of appetite, he could not enjoy his delicious mor&s;els. At other times, tempted by their lu&s;cious flavour, he fed to an exce&s;s, which brought on him a variety of painful and loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;es. And at all times it was matter of grief to him, that the plea&s;ures of eating and drinking &s;hould &s;o &s;oon be over.

He has made amiable ob|jects only that they might be loved.</P>
<P>NOW let us &s;ee what pa&s;&s;es in the heart of a per&s;on deeply &s;mitten with love. He thinks with delight of the per&s;on beloved; he hurries with impe|tuo&s;ity towards the charming object, and whatever keeps or removes him from her is tormenting; he is afraid of
<PB N="184" REF="030282_0185_0FE5A0066700F088">
giving her any di&s;plea&s;ure; he inquires into her ta&s;te and inclinations, in order to comply with and gratify them; he likes to hear her commended; talks of her with &s;atisfaction, and care&s;&s;es every thing that renews the agreeable idea.</P>
<P>IT is a mi&s;take to think that there is an e&s;&s;ential difference between this and divine love. We have but one way of loving: Men love God and their friends in the &s;ame manner; and the&s;e affec|tions differ only in the diver&s;ity of their objects and ends. Thus a pious man filled with &s;entiments towards God, like tho&s;e of a virtuous lover, would be glad to behold him, and to be united to him; he thinks of him with delight, and &s;peaks of him with reverence; he rejoices to &s;ee him honored, and is hap|py to hear him prai&s;ed; he meditates on his laws with plea&s;ure, and obeys them with alacrity.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="030282_0186_0FE5A0090FE872E0">
THAT this love by which a pious mind is united to its Creator, is a &s;ource of the pure&s;t plea&s;ures, we now proceed to &s;hew, not &s;olely on the authorities of &s;cripture, but by the force of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THE man who loves God, enjoys that fir&s;t of felicities, the <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of having placed his affections on the only object in the univer&s;e that truly de&s;erves them. Our love is the mo&s;t precious thing we po&s;&s;e&s;s; it is indeed the only thing we can properly call our own, and therefore to be&s;tow it unworthily, is the greate&s;t &s;hame and &s;ore&s;t mi&s;take that we can ever commit. A man mu&s;t needs be infinitely mortified and troub|led, when he finds that the object of his love po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not that excellence which he fondly expected would &s;atisfy his wi&s;hes and make him completely happy. Alas! What is a little &s;kin deep beauty, a few fla&s;hes of wit, or
<PB N="186" REF="030282_0187_0FE5A00B1EE0CCE8">
&s;ome &s;mall degrees of goodne&s;s? We &s;oon &s;ee to the bottom of &s;uch &s;hallow goods, and con&s;equently mu&s;t experi|ence a decay of that admiration and affection which con&s;titutes happine&s;s in the fir&s;t degree. But to no &s;uch mor|tifying di&s;appointment is he liable, who directs his love to God. In him the enlightened eye of true philo&s;ophy di&s;|covers &s;o much of all that is great and good, as to keep the happy mind in an eternal extacy of admiration and love.</P>
<P>DIVINE love advances the happine&s;s of man, becau&s;e it tends, above all other attachments, to refine and ennoble his nature. The mo&s;t inattentive mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that love has a &s;urprizing force to give our manners a re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the per&s;on we love. Seen through the eyes of a tender affection, even blemi&s;hes appear like beauties, and heaven born virtue puts on charms more than human. No wonder then that we
<PB N="187" REF="030282_0188_0FE5A00D27331C48">
&s;o ea&s;ily adopt the &s;entiments, and imi|tate the manners of tho&s;e we love. This is a conduct &s;o natural and common, that to tell the character of any man, we need but be told that of the per|&s;on's he loves.</P>
<P>HENCE, the anxious parent rejoices to &s;ee his child fond of the &s;ociety of the virtuous and wi&s;e: he knows that &s;uch an attachment indicates a reli&s;h for virtue, and promi&s;es an honourable and happy event: while, on the other hand, he deplores his attachment to the vain and vicious, as a &s;ad, but certain pre|&s;age of folly and depravity.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY then, in order to be hap|py, it mo&s;t nearly concerns us to direct our love to the proper object. But who, or what is that object? The creatures all have their imperfections. They are all utterly unworthy, and beneath the &s;upreme love of an immortal mind. And to love the&s;e in the extreme, is
<PB N="188" REF="030282_0189_0FE5A00F33AA1EB8">
infinitely to demean our&s;elves, to di&s;|grace our under&s;tandings, to contract low earthly pa&s;&s;ions, and con&s;equently to make our&s;elves mi&s;erable. Would we do honour to our rea&s;on, would we dignify our affections, ennoble our na|ture, and ri&s;e to true happine&s;s, let us give our hearts to God. The man who loves God is animated with an ambi|tion becoming the dignity of his birth; he is in&s;pired with a greatne&s;s of &s;oul that &s;purns all grovelling pa&s;&s;ions and ba&s;e de&s;igns. The love which he has for God impells him, by a &s;weet and powerful influence, to imitate his all lovely and adorable perfections, and con&s;equently renders him every day a more divine and heavenly creature.</P>
<P>GOD is the only worthy object of our love, becau&s;e he is the only one who will certainly and generou&s;ly reward it. Love, as we have ob&s;erved, was de&s;ign|ed to be the &s;pring of joy, but, alas!
<PB N="189" REF="030282_0190_0FE5A011C0726CF8">
when placed on the creature, it often proves a &s;ource of &s;orrow, becau&s;e it is too often treated with ingratitude and neglect. The lover in giving his heart, gives his <HI>all;</HI> and, if after &s;o great a &s;a|crifice, he cannot obtain the fond re|turn he coveted, what can be expected but that he &s;hould &s;icken with grief, and &s;ink under an oppre&s;&s;ive load of melan|choly? But though our fellow worms &s;hould reject our love with di&s;dain, yet it is always&mdash;O! adorable goodne&s;s! it is always acceptable to God. Amid&s;t the adorations of millions of glorious angels, he graciou&s;ly ob&s;erves the atten|tions we pay him, and receives with complacency our &s;malle&s;t tribute of af|fection. He knows that the &s;ouls which he has made cannot be happy until they return to him. Uncea&s;ingly he calls to them&mdash;</P>
<P>"<HI>SEEK ye my face.</HI>" And if, con|vinced by a thou&s;and di&s;appointments,

of the vanity of all other loves, we &s;hould at length, happily take up our re&s;olution and &s;ay, "<HI>Thy face, O God, we will &s;eek.</HI>" Immediately his prevent|ing love meets us more than half way; the harps of Heaven &s;well with louder &s;trains of joy, and &s;ongs of congratula|tion fill the eternal regions.</P>
<P>DIVINE love infinitely exceeds in point of true happine&s;s, all other attach|ments, becau&s;e, it does not, like them, expo&s;e us to the pangs of &s;eparation. If that &s;weet pa&s;&s;ion, which, with chains dearer than tho&s;e of gold, unites earth|ly lovers, were never to be di&s;&s;olved, it would be well: But, alas! this is a fe|licity which Heaven has not thought fit to confer on erring mortals. The iron hand of nece&s;&s;ity or duty often tears us away from our deare&s;t friends, and con&s;igns us to weari&s;ome months of mutual fears and re&s;tle&s;s longings for re-union. Sometimes, in the happie&s;t
<PB N="191" REF="030282_0192_0FE5A015F10F6708">
moments of friend&s;hip, the thought of death occurs and throws a &s;udden damp on our ri&s;ing joys. Sometimes it is our lot to &s;it by the &s;ick beds of tho&s;e we love, and hear their piercing moans, to mark, with unutterable angui&s;h, the faultering &s;peech and &s;inking eye, or wipe the cold damps of death from tho&s;e cheeks which we have ki&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and times. Such &s;cenes and &s;eparations, and all mortal loves are liable to &s;uch, occa&s;ion a grief not to be equalled by all the misfortunes of life, and make us dearly pay for all the pa&s;t plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e melancholy moments we are made to feel how truly ble&s;&s;ed are they who have made the eternal God their love, nothing can ever &s;eparate them from him. When the faire&s;t of the human fair are gone down into the du&s;t, and have left their lovers to mourn|ing and woe. Nay, when after millions

Even then &s;hall his triumphant lovers behold his glorious face cloathed in eternal beauty, and &s;hall drink of the rivers of plea&s;ure that flow at his right-hand forevermore. Neither will the lovers of God ever experience, even in this world, the pangs of &s;eparation from him, while they walk firmly in the golden path of duty.

<P>WE live in a country, where one day in every week is &s;et apart for the public wor&s;hip of God. To the man who loves not his maker, this di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;eventh day is not very likely to be plea&s;|ing. As he is not a religious man, it is more than probable that he is a man of the world, a man of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure; and in either ca&s;e the Sabbath mu&s;t be unwelcome, as it is an interruption, and indeed a clear lo&s;s of one day's plea&s;ure or profit in every week.

<P>ON this account too, the man who loves God, will &s;ee a church in quite another light, and with &s;entiments hap|pily different from tho&s;e of the man who loves him not.

being, who has given us every thing we already po&s;&s;e&s;s, and from whom we expect every thing we yet hope for.

his goodne&s;s. By him was kindled every &s;park of friend&s;hip that ever glowed on earth, and therefore to him it ju&s;tly returns laden with the pure&s;t incen&s;e of gratitude.

In&s;tead of a&s;cribing it to the policy of his own councils, or to the &s;trength of his own arm, he gives the prai&s;e to him alone, who &s;trews the earth with good things for man, and teaches him wi&s;dom to improve and convert them to his own u&s;e.</P>

In all that is good or fair, he traces <HI>his</HI> hand.

<P>BUT divine love adds greatly to our happine&s;s, not only by giving a fre&s;h flavour to the &s;weets of pro&s;perity; but by correcting in an eminent degree, the bitterne&s;s of <HI>adver&s;ity.</HI></P>

Adver&s;ity is the grand te&s;t of what is true and what is fal&s;e among the differ|ent objects of our choice; and our love of God, tried by this te&s;t will &s;oon di&s;|cover its infinite value and excellence. Per&s;ons of every character are liable to di&s;tre&s;s. The man who loveth God, and he who loveth him not, is expo&s;ed to the &s;troke of adver&s;ity. But on the bad man, adver&s;ity falls with double weight, becau&s;e it finds them without defence and without re&s;ource. When his health, his riches and plea&s;ures, in which he placed his happine&s;s, are all torn from him, overwhelmed with &s;ad|ne&s;s and de&s;pair, he knows not whether to turn for relief. If, as is mo&s;t natur|al for a creature in di&s;tre&s;s, he lifts his &s;upplicating eyes to his maker, con&s;ci|ous ingratitude and di&s;obedience to God, immediately check him: if he turn to his fellow-men, whom he has abu&s;ed or neglected, con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of meriting their

<P>BUT to the man who&s;e &s;oul rejoices in his God, adver&s;ity has nothing gloomy and terrible. Believing every thing in the world to be under the ad|mini&s;tration of God, and looking up to that God, as to an all-wi&s;e and benevolent father and friend, he welcomes every thing that comes from him. Per&s;uaded that the Father of Mercies, delighteth not needle&s;sly to <HI>grieve</HI> the children of men; and well knowing that he fore|&s;aw this impending affliction, and could ea&s;ily have prevented it: he concludes, that, &s;ince it <HI>is</HI> come, it is come on &s;ome errend of love.

The very idea, that this or that affliction was brought on us by him, would &s;weetly reconcile us to it, and kindle in us a di|vine ambition to plea&s;e him by the cheerfulne&s;s of our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Afflic|tions we &s;hould look on not as marks of

God's di&s;plea&s;ure, but as certain evi|dences of his love&mdash;

<P>THESE are the views in which the di|vine lover is taught to contemplate the afflictive di&s;pen&s;ations of his God; not as the me&s;&s;engers of his wrath, but as the mini&s;ters of his mercy, and the great

<P>BUT divine love not only renders life plea&s;ant, and death peaceful, but it ac|companies us into heaven, and there gives us to enjoy the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea|&s;ures, that God him&s;elf can confer on happy &s;ouls: For there we &s;hall always live in the pre&s;ence of God, the great fountain of all loveline&s;s and glory, and &s;hall love him with ten thou&s;and times more ardour than we now do, or even can imagine; for the longer we behold, the more we &s;hall know him, and the more we know, the better we &s;hall love him; and &s;o through everla&s;ting ages, our love &s;hall be extending and enrap|turing it&s;elf with his infinite beauty and loveline&s;s. Now love is the &s;weete&s;t and happie&s;t of all pa&s;&s;ions, and it is merely by accident that it is accompanied with any di&s;quieting or painful feelings. Either the per&s;on beloved is ab&s;ent,
<PB N="218" REF="030282_0219_0FE5A04DF0044068">
which corrodes it with unquiet de&s;ire, or he is unhappy, or unkind, which im|bitters it with grief; or he is fickle and incon&s;tant, which inflames it with rage and jealou&s;y; but, &s;eparated from all the&s;e di&s;agreeable accidents, and it is all pure delight and joy.</P>
<P>BUT in heaven, our love of God will have none of the&s;e di&s;quieting circum|&s;tances attending it; for there he will never be ab&s;ent from us, but will be continually entertaining our amorous minds with the pro&s;pect of his infinite beauties. There we &s;hall always feel his love to us in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and endearing effects, even in the glory of that crown which he will &s;et upon our heads, and in the ravi&s;hing &s;weetne&s;s of tho&s;e joys which he will infu&s;e into our hearts. There we &s;hall experience the continuation of his love in the con|tinued fruition of all that an everla&s;t|ing heaven means, and be convinced,
<PB N="219" REF="030282_0220_0FE5A05002E28298">
as well by the perpetuity of his good|ne&s;s to us, as well as by the immutabi|lity of his nature, that he is an un|changeable lover. And there we &s;hall find him a mo&s;t happy being, happy be|yond the va&s;te&s;t wi&s;hes of our love; &s;o that we &s;hall not only delight in him, as he is infinitely lovely, but rejoice and triumph in him too as he is infinitely happy. For love unites the intere&s;ts, as well as the hearts of lovers, and gives to each, the joys and felicities of the other. So that in that ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate we &s;hall &s;hare in the felicity of God proportionably to the degree of our love to him: For the more we love him, the more we &s;hall &s;till e&s;pou&s;e his hap|py intere&s;t; and the more we are inte|re&s;ted in his happine&s;s, the happier we mu&s;t be, and the more we mu&s;t enjoy of it. Thus love gives us a real po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion and enjoyment of God; it makes us co-partners with him in him&s;elf, de|rives
<PB N="220" REF="030282_0221_0FE5A0520B341290">
his happine&s;s upon us, and makes it as really ours as his. So that God's happine&s;s is, as it were, the common bank and trea&s;ury of all divine lovers, in which they have every one a &s;hare, and of which, proportionably to the degrees of their love to him, they do all draw and participate to all eterni|ty. And could they but love him as much as he de&s;erves, that is <HI>infinitely,</HI> they would be as infinitely ble&s;&s;ed and happy as he is: For then all his happi|ne&s;s would be theirs, and they would have the &s;ame delightful &s;en&s;e and feel|ing of it, as if it were all tran&s;planted into their own bo&s;oms. God, there|fore being an infinitely lovely, infinite|ly loving, and infinitely happy being, when we come to dwell forever in his ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence, our love to him can be productive of none but &s;weet and ravi&s;hing emotions; for the immen&s;e perfections it will then find in its object,

our good travels thither. Such won|derful care has he taken not to be de|feated of this his kind intention to make us everla&s;tingly happy. "<HI>O that men would therefore love the Lord for his good|ne&s;s, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men.</HI>"</P>
<P>THAT the&s;e dear pledges of God's love may in&s;pire our hearts with &s;uit|able returns of gratitude, we &s;hould often <HI>reflect</HI> on them, and &s;pread them before our minds in all their endearing circum&s;tances.

<P>AND, while we are &s;eeking this <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of <HI>great price,</HI> let us, as we hope for &s;ucce&s;s, guard our <HI>innocence,</HI> as the trem|bling mi&s;er guards his hoarded gold. The bo&s;om that burns with impure de|&s;ires,

<P>AND, together with our own exer|tions, we &s;hould often implore the aid of all a&s;&s;i&s;ting heaven. To him, who alone knows its ine&s;timable worth, let our fervent prayers be con&s;tantly a&s;cend|ing.</P>
<P>"<HI>FATHER of life and love, thou God &s;upreme, O teach our hearts to love thee: For to whom, O Lord, &s;hall we give our hearts but to thee?

<P>HE who loves God is the alone wi&s;e, dignified and happy man. For he loves the only good that is worthy the af|fections of an immortal mind. He loves a friend who alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es almighty power to protect him, unerring wi&s;dom to coun&s;el him, and infinite love to ble&s;s him. He loves an immortal friend who can never die and for&s;ake him, and an unchangeable friend who will never requite his love with neglect.</P>
<P>HIS love of God &s;weetens every duty, and makes the yoke of obedience to &s;it light. It heightens the &s;mile of pro&s;pe|rity, and cheers the gloom of adver&s;ity.

<P>THE fir&s;t fruits of a creature's love are due to God, as to his Crea|tor and the author of all his good; the &s;econd are due to men, as to his brethren and fellow &s;harers in the boun|ties of their common parent.

To be care&s;&s;ed and beloved by all around us, is one of the deare&s;t wi&s;hes of the human heart. It is a natural, it is a laudable wi&s;h. Great pains have been taken, and infinite expence incur|red to attain this coveted honor, and yet the greater part never attain it, merely through defect of love on their own part. Let beauty, wit, gold, &amp;c. boa&s;t and do all they can, yet will it be found in the end, that
<Q><L>"In &s;pite of all the dull mi&s;taken elves,</L>
<L>"They who wou'd make us love, mu&s;t love, them|&s;elves."</L></Q></P>
<P>LOVE is the univer&s;al charm. It po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a beauty that wins and ravi&s;hes every heart. A &s;ingle &s;park of it in genero&s;ity of dealing excites our ad|miration; a glimp&s;e of it in courteous behaviour &s;ecures to a man our e&s;teem, and &s;weetly endears him to us. How charming is the countenance that is brightened by the &s;miles of love! How &s;weet the voice that is tuned by the
<PB N="236" REF="030282_0237_0FE5A07879A026C8">
melody of love! How gladdening to the heart, the beams that &s;parkle from the eye of love! Indeed love, or good|ne&s;s, which is but another name, is the only amiable thing in nature. Power and wealth may be re&s;pected, wit and beauty may be admired, but if &s;eparat|ed from goodne&s;s, they neither de&s;erve nor can command our love: For the wor&s;t and mo&s;t wretched of beings po&s;|&s;e&s;s them in a very high degree. The prince of darkne&s;s has more power, and tyrannizes over more &s;laves by far than the Great Turk. One devil may have more wit than all the Achitophels in the world, and yet, with all his wit, he is very odious and mi&s;erable. And &s;uch, in proportion, is every one who partakes in his accur&s;ed di&s;po&s;ition of hatred and malice.</P>
<P>SEE how Pandorus is beloved and care&s;&s;ed. Is it becau&s;e of his hone&s;ty? This virtue only gains our e&s;teem, but
<PB N="237" REF="030282_0238_0FE5A07CEA21CC10">
does not captivate the heart. Is it be|cau&s;e he is beneficent and friendly? Many who are &s;o fond of his company have no need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Is it becau&s;e he is gay, humorous, and en|tertaining? This would render him a|greeable, only when gaiety is &s;ea&s;on|able. No, he is more beloved than any other man in the world, only be|cau&s;e he is the mo&s;t <HI>affectionate</HI> man in it. He &s;eems to live but to plea&s;e, to oblige, and to &s;erve his friends. If he find out what will plea&s;e you, he pre|vents your de&s;ires, and does it with &s;uch an air of cheerfulne&s;s, that, while he has no other view than to oblige you, he &s;eems to follow nothing but his own choice and inclinations. This charming complai&s;ance of Pandorus was not learn|ed in the &s;chool of the world; but is the rich fruit of his genuine benevo|lence. Hence it renders him equally endearing and equally agreeable, at all
<PB N="238" REF="030282_0239_0FE5A07E828D0BB0">
times, and to all ranks. He is not a &s;ycophant to the great, and &s;cornful or negligent of the poor; he does not treat you to-day as a <HI>dear friend,</HI> and to-morrow <HI>knows you not,</HI> but <HI>uniformly</HI> his looks and manners are tho&s;e of the man who con&s;iders both the rich and the poor as his brethren. If you love like Pandorus, and like him take a plea|&s;ure in contributing to the happine&s;s of others, I will an&s;wer for the friend&s;hip of all who know you; this is a perfec|tion that will engage people at all times, in all places, and on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT love not only renders us thus dear and de&s;ireable to others; but it &s;preads the &s;un&s;hine of &s;weete&s;t peace over our own minds. It delivers us from the tyranny of all tho&s;e bad pa&s;|&s;ions which make us mi&s;erable. Like a golden curb it checks the fiercene&s;s of anger, that dangerous &s;torm and hur|ricane of the &s;oul. A man can hardly
<PB N="239" REF="030282_0240_0FE5A0808C8B26B0">
be incen&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e whom he ten|derly loves: an accidental neglect, a ha&s;ty word, a &s;mall unkindne&s;s, will not agitate a loving &s;pirit, much le&s;s work it up to hateful <HI>fire-eyed</HI> fury.</P>
<P>IT bani&s;hes envy, that &s;everely ju&s;t vice which never fails to puni&s;h it&s;elf; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to repine at the wealth or pro&s;perity, at the virtue or fame of him whom we cordially love. It excludes revenge, that cruel canker of the heart; for who can indulge bit|ter re&s;entments, or form dark de&s;igns of evil again&s;t him whom he tenderly loves, and in who&s;e good he heartily delights?</P>
<P>IT &s;ubdues ambition and avarice, tho&s;e a&s;piring painful pa&s;&s;ions. For who could domineer over tho&s;e whom he loves, and who&s;e honor he tenders as his own? Who could extort from and impoveri&s;h tho&s;e whom he earne&s;tly wi&s;hes and would gladly &s;ee to pro&s;per?
<PB N="240" REF="030282_0241_0FE5A0829A7D0D38">
A competence will &s;eem like abundance to him who lives as among brethren, taking him&s;elf but for one among the re&s;t, and can as ill endure to &s;ee them want as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is in the prevalence of &s;uch bad pa&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, that human mi&s;ery chiefly con&s;i&s;ts. Love is their only &s;o|vereign antidote. It alone &s;ubdues and expels their fatal poi&s;on, and thus re|&s;tores health and happine&s;s to our long tortured bo&s;oms. Love, like a cele&s;tial queen, walks before, meekne&s;s and gen|tlene&s;s follow as her elde&s;t daughters, while joy and peace, with all the &s;i&s;ter graces, make up the immortal retinue.</P>
<P>BUT love pre&s;erves us not only from our own, but from the malignant pa&s;|&s;ions of others. Like &s;weete&s;t mu&s;ic, it has power to &s;ooth the &s;avage brea&s;t, to melt hearts of flint, and to tame the fierce&s;t &s;pirits. Its mild and &s;erene countenance, its &s;oft and gentle &s;pirit
<PB N="241" REF="030282_0242_0FE5A0861B1FE8A0">
its courteous and obliging manners, its fair dealing, its endearing conver&s;ation, its readine&s;s to do good &s;ervices to any man, is the only charm under heaven to di&s;arm the bad pa&s;&s;ions of men, and to guard our per&s;on from a&s;&s;ault, our intere&s;t from damage, and our reputa|tion from &s;lander. For who can be &s;o unnatural as to hate the man who loves us and is ever ready to do us good? What wretch, what demon, can find in his heart to be a foe to him who is a warm friend to all? The vile&s;t &s;inner cannot be &s;o vile, &s;o de&s;titute of goodne&s;s. <HI>If you love tho&s;e who love you what reward have you, do not even &s;inners the &s;ame?</HI></P>
<P>OF this wonderful power of love, to convert foes into friends, we have many plea&s;ing examples in holy writ. E&s;au was a rough man, and exceedingly an|gry with his brother Jacob, and yet how ea&s;ily did Jacob's meek and affec|tionate behaviour overcome him! "<HI>E&s;au</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="030282_0243_0FE5A087AAB18508">
<HI>ran to meet Jacob, and felt on his neck and ki&s;&s;ed him, and they wept.</HI>"</P>
<P>SAUL was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a furious envy and &s;pite again&s;t David. Yet what acknowledgments did David's generous dealing extort from him?&mdash;</P>
<P>"<HI>IS this thy voice my &s;on David? Thou art more righteous than I, for thou ha&s;t re|warded me good, whereas I have reward|ed the evil; behold I have played the fool, and erred exceedingly.</HI>"</P>
<P>THOUGH gratitude is not &s;o common a virtue as it ought to be, yet the re|membrance of his former kindne&s;&s;es often &s;urrounds a good man in di&s;tre&s;s, with many warm friends and generous comforters. Is he in danger, who will not defend him? Is he falling, who will not uphold him? Is he &s;landered, who will not vindicate him?</P>
<P>LOVE di&s;po&s;es us to put to their pro|per u&s;es every ble&s;&s;ing that may fall to our lot; while, <HI>without it,</HI> the mo&s;t

&s;plendid advantages that we could de|&s;ire, the large&s;t fortunes and brighte&s;t parts, will become vain and fruitle&s;s, if not pernicious and de&s;tructive to us. For, what is our rea&s;on worth if it &s;erve only to contrive little &s;orry de&s;igns for our&s;elves? What is wit good for, if it be &s;pent only in making &s;port, or creat|ing mi&s;chief? What &s;ignifies wealth, if it be u&s;ele&s;sly hoarded up, or vainly thrown away on the lu&s;ts of one poor worm? What is our credit but a mere puff of air, if we do not give it &s;ub|&s;tance by making it an engine of doing good? What is our virtue it&s;elf, if bu|ried in ob&s;curity it yield no benefit to others by the lu&s;tre of its example, or by its real influence? If the&s;e advantages mini&s;ter, only to our own particular plea&s;ure or profit, how mean and in|con&s;iderable they appear!</P>
<P>BUT under the management of love, &s;ee what worth and importance they a&s;|&s;ume.

Our wealth becomes the bank from which the weeping widow, the in|digent young trade&s;man, and the help|le&s;s orphan, draw the &s;upply of their wants. Our wit is employed to expo&s;e the deformities of vice, and to paint virtue in her lovelie&s;t colours. Our knowledge is applied to in&s;truct the ig|norant, to admoni&s;h the guilty, and to comfort the wretched. Thus love ena|bles us to lay out our talents in &s;o ex|cellent a manner as to &s;ecure tho&s;e in|e&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;the love of God, the friend&s;hip of mankind, and all the exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures of doing good. How great then is the worth of love, &s;ince without it the goods even of the weal|thie&s;t are but temporal and tran&s;ient, &s;uch as too often prove dangerous &s;nares and baneful poi&s;ons, and are at be&s;t but impertinent baubles.</P>
<P>LOVE gives worth to all our apparent virtues, in&s;omuch, that without it no

quality of the heart, no action of life is valuable in it&s;elf or plea&s;ing to God. Without love, what is courage, but the boldne&s;s of a lion or the fiercene&s;s of a tyger? What is meekne&s;s but the &s;oft|ne&s;s of a woman, or the weakne&s;s of a child? What is politene&s;s, but the gri|mace of a monkey, or the fooleries of a fop? What is ju&s;tice, but pa&s;&s;ion or policy? What is wi&s;dom but craft and &s;ubtilty? Without love, and what is faith but dry opinion? What is hope but blind pre&s;umption? What is alms|giving but o&s;tentation? What is mar|tyrdom but &s;tubborne&s;s? What is de|votion but a mockery of God? What is any practice, how &s;pecious &s;oever in it&s;elf, or beneficial to others, but the effect of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and pride? "<HI>Though I have faith &s;o that I could remove moun|tains, and have not love, I am nothing. Though</HI> I give all my goods to feed <HI>the</HI>

<P>BUT love &s;anctifies every action, and converts all that we do into virtue. It is true bravery indeed, when a man, out of love to his neighbour, and a hearty de&s;ire to promote his good, encounters dangers and difficulties. It is genuine meekne&s;s, when a man out of love, and an unwillingne&s;s to hurt his neighbour, patiently puts up with injuries. It is politene&s;s indeed, when cordial affection expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in civil language, re|&s;pectful manners, and obliging actions. It is excellent ju&s;tice, when a man re|garding his neighbour's ca&s;e as his own, does to him as he would have it done to him&s;elf. It is admirable wi&s;dom, which &s;tudies to promote our neigh|bour's welfare. It is a noble faith, which, working by love, produces the rich fruits of obedience. It is a &s;olid hope, which is grounded on that ever|la&s;ting

ba&s;is of love which never fails. It is a &s;incere alms, which not only the hand but the heart reaches out. It is an acceptable &s;acrifice, which is kindled by the holy fire of love. It is an hal|lowed devotion which is offered up from a heart pure and benevolent like the be|ing whom it adores.</P>
<P>LOVE is a grand in&s;trument of our happine&s;s, becau&s;e it alone renders &s;weet and plea&s;ant all the duties which we owe to our neighbour. All agree, that the &s;econd great bu&s;ine&s;s of men in this life is to learn to love one another. And &s;ince the con&s;tant performance of kind and generous &s;ervices to each other, tends mo&s;t effectually to fan the flame of love, our heavenly Father is perpe|tually calling on us to perform tho&s;e good offices to our brethren. He com|mands <HI>the &s;trong to bear the burdens of the weak, the rich to abound in good works</HI>
<PB N="248" REF="030282_0249_0FE5A0950BEA3B60">

Such &s;entiments and works of beneficence and love, make a con&s;iderable part of our duties, duties that occur every <HI>day</HI> and <HI>hour</HI> of our lives. To perform the&s;e with alacrity and plea&s;ure mu&s;t add greatly to our happine&s;s, becau&s;e, &s;ince they occur &s;o frequently, if we have but the art to turn them into plea&s;ures, our whole life mu&s;t be one continued round of plea&s;ure. Whereas, on the contrary, if we take no delight in them, we &s;tand a fair chance to lead very unea&s;y lives; as we &s;hall be continually called on by duties which we cannot perform with|out reluctance, nor yet neglect without much vexation and regret.</P>

wonder-worker. It converts duties into delights, and penances into plea&s;ures. Are you wealthy? In making you &s;o, heaven kindly intended for you the joy of acting as the friend and benefactor of the poor. That you may be &s;en&s;ible how e&s;&s;ential love is to the cheerful di&s;|charge of the duties of beneficence, turn your eyes towards Dives: In him you behold one of the wealthie&s;t of the &s;ons of fortune. His cellars, his barns, his coffers, are all bur&s;ting out with abundance; but his heart po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not one &s;park of love. Alas! the &s;ad con|&s;equences of his lacking <HI>this one thing needful.</HI> Hence, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wealth &s;ufficient to enable him, like the good angel of his neighbourhood, to &s;catter ble&s;&s;ings around him on at lea&s;t fifty needy families; he lo&s;es the joy, and they the benefit of &s;uch noble cha|rities. De&s;titute of love, Dives takes no delight, even in feeding the hungry,

in cloathing the naked, or in &s;oothing the &s;orrows of &s;ickne&s;s and poverty. Unhappy Dives! Works of love which ble&s;&s;ed angels would prefer to their nec|tar and ambro&s;ia, are &s;et before thee, but thou ha&s;t no reli&s;h for them. Dives keeps a &s;plendid table, has va&s;t apart|ments, rich furniture, co&s;tly jewels, a large number of &s;ervants, and &s;umptu|ous equipages; and that is enough for him; his poor childi&s;h fancy has no idea of any thing &s;uperior.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ee the noble and excellent De|mophilus. Demophilus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an e&s;|tate not inferior to that of Dives; but his e&s;tate, though ample, is not half &s;o ample as his heart. Demophilus de|nies him&s;elf all the pomps and &s;uper|fluities of life, in order that he may &s;well the tide of his liberality to the poor. It were an endle&s;s, though plea&s;|ing ta&s;k, to relate how many friendle&s;s little children he has educated, how

Every day is to Demophilus a day of happine&s;s, becau&s;e it is &s;pent in offices of kindne&s;s to tho&s;e whom love has taught him to view in the endearing light of relations; and, in &s;erving whom, he acts with all the alacrity of a brother. Thus love employs him in &s;uch good works as yield the pure&s;t plea&s;ures while he is engaged in them, and the remembrance of which will be a well of &s;weete&s;t waters &s;pringing up in his bo&s;om to eternal life.</P>
<P>ARE you a poor man? You will find love to be equally e&s;&s;ential to your hap|hapine&s;s. Love will not only pre&s;erve you from all the pangs of envy and di&s;|content; tho&s;e infernal vipers which pry on the vitals of too many of our

ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude?&mdash;Let the following true &s;tory reply.</P>
<P>A YOUNG gentleman, whom we &s;hall call Leander, had the good fortune to be born of parents, who well knew that happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts rather in the good qualities of the heart, than in the rich contents of the &s;trong box. He was therefore early taught to look on the love of God and of his neighbour, as the be&s;t wealth that man or angel can po&s;&s;e&s;s. His progre&s;s in virtue was equal to the fonde&s;t expectations of his parents. Truth, honor and goodne&s;s, &s;hone &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly in all his con|duct, that to love him, one needed but to know him. At the age of three and twenty he lo&s;t his father; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing but a very &s;mall fortune, he re&s;olved to go into trade. Leander had five or &s;ix mercantile friends, each of whom throwing in a couple of hundred pounds worth of goods, made him up a pretty
<PB N="266" REF="030282_0267_0FE5A0C0030B6758">
a&s;&s;ortment. With great alacrity he en|tered upon this new employment; but, as it would &s;eem, merely to evince the error of tho&s;e parents, who think that religion alone is &s;ufficient to make their children happy. His father had taken great pains to fit him for heaven; but had not &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed him to make his way good here on earth. He had &s;carcely ever told Leander, that though it be happine&s;s to love, it is &s;till virtue to be prudent; and, that to mingle the <HI>harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the dove with the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent,</HI> and to <HI>take head of men,</HI> even while he <HI>loves them,</HI> are commandments of the Great Tea|cher him&s;elf. He had hardly ever men|tioned to Leander, the importance of receipts, vouchers, and written con|tracts; nor related to him the many &s;ad in&s;tances of un&s;u&s;pecting goodne&s;s &s;nared and ruined by in&s;idious villainy; and how often, for want of receipts,
<PB N="267" REF="030282_0268_0FE5A0C211312B38">
the be&s;t men have been compelled to a &s;econd payment of debts that have kept their no&s;es to the grind&s;tone half their lives after. No; but to con&s;ider all men as the children of God, and co|heirs of glory; to love them as him|&s;elf, and to <HI>think evil of no man</HI>&mdash;the&s;e were the only &s;entiments which Lean|der was taught: The&s;e he carried with him behind the counter. Leander was &s;oon found out to be a <HI>fine young man!</HI> every body admired his goods, and wi&s;hed to buy if they could but have a little credit. Leander anticipated every wi&s;h, and credited every body.</P>
<P>IN a very &s;hort time, out of a thou|&s;and pounds worth of goods, he had not a remnant left. His rivals were &s;it to bur&s;t with &s;pleen and envy at &s;uch prodigious &s;ales; while his friends a&s;|cribed &s;uch &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;s to divine interpo&s;ition. At the appointed time his creditors demanded their money.
<PB N="268" REF="030282_0269_0FE5A0C41DD0C448">
The too credulous Leander was not prepared to pay. Unable to wait longer, they &s;eized on his little patrimony, and threw him into pri&s;on. Cruel parents, who thus expo&s;e your children uncover|ed by the &s;hield of prudence, to the <HI>fiery darts</HI> of fraud and villainy! O re|member that the want of prudence, is too often, even in the be&s;t men, &s;uc|ceeded by the want of virtue; and that, in many in&s;tances, the devil him&s;elf a&s;ks not an abler advocate for <HI>vice</HI> than <HI>po|verty.</HI> Happily for Leander, his vir|tue was full grown, and of a good con|&s;titution. He did not, as thou&s;ands have done, cur&s;e that ea&s;ine&s;s of na|ture, that benevolence of &s;entiment, which had duped and betrayed him; he did not vow eternal war again&s;t his &s;pecies, and re&s;olve to practi&s;e in future the &s;ame arts which had wrought his ruin. No! fraud and inju&s;tice now ap|peared to him hateful as the hags of hell.
<PB N="269" REF="030282_0270_0FE5A0C814C71B68">
While, by contra&s;t, his love of virtue was exalted to adoration. To have de|ceived, though unintentionally, and thence to have injured his patrons, cau|&s;ed Leander much grief; but it was grief unimbittered by the gall of guilt. To have di&s;covered &s;uch a want of vir|tue and humanity among men, excited emotions, but they were the emotions of compa&s;&s;ion, not of re&s;entment. Still <HI>his prayers and his benevolence went up before God.</HI> After fifty days confine|ment, the &s;till virtuous Leander was di&s;charged from pri&s;on, and from all legal obligation to pay his former debts. He then went round again among his debtors; many of whom affected by his pathetic remon&s;trances, di&s;charged their accounts. With this money, pur|cha&s;ing a &s;mall a&s;&s;ortment of goods, he entered a &s;econd time into trade, and with becoming caution. At the expi|ration of five years, having &s;aved enough
<PB N="270" REF="030282_0271_0FE5A0C9A61E3978">
for that purpo&s;e, he ha&s;tened up to town to pay off his former debts, and to evince the divinity of that love, which cannot be happy while it <HI>owes any man</HI> any thing. He called toge|ther his former creditors to a tavern, where, by his orders, a hand&s;ome din|ner was prepared for them. He receiv|ed them with the utmo&s;t cordiality, and, without having as yet gratified their curio&s;ity as to the occa&s;ion of the meet|ing, he politely pre&s;&s;ed them to &s;it down to dine. On turning up their plates, every man beheld in a heap of &s;hining gold, the full amount, princi|pal and intere&s;t, of his former claim again&s;t Leander.</P>

WE have been copious on this part of our &s;ubject, for a very plain rea&s;on: the payment of our debts is a duty that occurs &s;o frequently, that whatever tends to make it a plea&s;ure, mu&s;t con|&s;equently add <HI>greatly</HI> to our happine&s;s; and have abundantly &s;hewn it is love, and love alone that can make hone&s;ty at all times a plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT there are many other duties, of equal importance to our own, and to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, to the cheer|ful performance of which, love is as indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary. This man's ava|rice may claim a part of our e&s;tate; or that man's unprovoked rage may in&s;ult our per&s;on, or &s;lander our name; now, to bear all this with temper, and to ne|gociate &s;o di&s;creetly with the&s;e our un|generous neighbours, as to di&s;arm their pa&s;&s;ions, and to make an honorable and la&s;ting peace, is certainly a mo&s;t de|&s;ireable event; but it is an event which

nothing but almighty love can accom|pli&s;h. And through defect of this love, how frequently have we &s;een the &s;light|e&s;t incroachments, or provocations to &s;tir up &s;uch horrid pa&s;&s;ions, in the bo|&s;oms of neighbours, and to hurry them into &s;uch &s;hameful exce&s;&s;es of injury and revenge, as have ended in the de|&s;truction of each others &s;ouls, bodies, and e&s;tates!</P>
<P>LET the real hi&s;tory of goodman Gruff and his neighbour Grub, eluci|date this melancholy truth.</P>
<P>THESE two men, who&s;e fortunes were ample, lived near neighbours to each other; &s;o near, that their lands, un|moved by the pa&s;&s;ion of their owners, lay and &s;lept together in the mo&s;t friend|ly embraces. That good being who had thus appointed their lots together in the &s;ame plea&s;ant places, had un|que&s;tionably intended, that they &s;hould learn from their own experience, how
<PB N="273" REF="030282_0274_0FE5A0D10E7E76E8">
happy a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. But alas! the ways of peace they knew not, for they were both &s;trangers to love; and, by natu|ral con&s;equence, both proud, &s;elfi&s;h, ira&s;cible and vindictive. On a re&s;urvey of his plantation, goodman Gruff found that his neighbour Grub had about two acres and a quarter of his ground in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had he made this <HI>impor|tant di&s;covery,</HI> than he &s;ent orders to Mr Grub, and not in the mo&s;t gentle terms, in&s;tantly to remove his fences, from that &s;pot of ground, or he &s;hould adopt mea&s;ures to compel him. From no friend on earth, would Mr. Grub have brooked &s;uch a me&s;&s;age; but from Gruff, it was altogether in&s;upportable. A reply, &s;uch as pride and hatred could dictate, was immediately made. A law &s;uit, of cour&s;e, commenced.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="030282_0275_0FE5A0D2CD600E98">
THIS produced the effect that u&s;ually attends law-&s;uits,&mdash;"a death unto friend|&s;hip, and a new birth unto hatred." Every expence incurred in the cour&s;e of the &s;uit inflamed their mutual hat|red; for they never failed to &s;et down the&s;e expences to the account of each others roguery: They never deigned to &s;alute, or to exchange a word; and, if accident at any time threw them into the &s;ame company, they ca&s;t &s;uch eyes of death on one another, and were &s;o pointedly brutal in their manners, as to &s;hock all who were not lo&s;t to humanity. To be threatened with the lo&s;s of two acres of land, or to have that much with|held, though each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many more than they could cultivate, was enough in &s;uch &s;ordid &s;ouls, to awaken the mo&s;t deadly pa&s;&s;ions.

LOVE adds greatly to the happine&s;s of man, becau&s;e it puts us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and gives us the enjoyment of every thing that is good and de&s;ireable in this life. By it, we may, without greedy avarice, or its cares and drudge|ries, &s;wim in tides of wealth. With|out proud ambition or any of its dif|ficulties and dangers, we may a&s;cend to the highe&s;t &s;eats of honor: without &s;ordid voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, or its di&s;ea&s;es and di&s;gu&s;t, we may ba&s;k in the lap of true plea&s;ures; without its pride, luxury or &s;loth, or any of its &s;nares and tempta|tions, we may fea&s;t at the table of pro|&s;perity. We may pluck the riche&s;t fruits of &s;cience and learning, without the pain of laborious &s;tudy: and we may ta&s;te the &s;weets of virtue and goodne&s;s without their toils. For, are not all the&s;e things ours, if we make them &s;o, by finding much delight and &s;atisfaction in them? Does not out neighbour's

Does not his plea&s;ure delight us, if we are plea&s;ed with his enjoyment of it? Does not his pro&s;perity ble&s;s us, if our hearts exult and triumph in it? This is the true Philo&s;opher's &s;tone, the divine magic of love which conveys all things into our hands, giving us a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and u&s;e in them of which nothing can deprive us.</P>
<P>BY virtue of this, (as Paul ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves) <Q><HI>Being &s;orrowful we yet always rejoice; having nothing we yet po&s;&s;e&s;s all things.</HI></Q> Neither is this property in our neighbour's goods merely imagin|ary, but real and &s;ub&s;tantial; indeed, for more real to the true lover of men, than it is generally to the legal owners of them. For how is property in things otherwi&s;e to be con&s;idered than by the
<PB N="285" REF="030282_0286_0FE5A0F0B162B728">
&s;atisfaction which they yield to the pre|&s;umed owner? And if the benevolent man find this &s;atisfaction in them, and in a high degree, why are they not truly his? May not the tree with &s;ome de|gree of propriety be called yours if you can pluck and enjoy its fruits at plea|&s;ure? Nay, does not the propriety more truly belong to you, if you equally en|joy the benefit, without partaking the trouble and expence which fall on the real owner? A loving man therefore can never be poor or mi&s;erable, except all the world &s;hould come to want and di&s;tre&s;s, for while his neighbour has any thing, he will enjoy it&mdash;<Q><HI>rejoicing with tho&s;e who rejoice.</HI></Q></P>
<P>BUT love not only advances us to the highe&s;t pitch of happine&s;s attain|able in this life, but, like a true friend, it will accompany us into heaven, and there complete our felicity, by exalting

<P>THIS &s;tronge&s;t and deare&s;t &s;entiment of nature, is confirmed by revelation, which a&s;&s;ures us, that heaven, the city of the eternal King, is inhabited by a great multitude, which no man can number, compo&s;ed of all the wi&s;e and good that ever exi&s;ted in the univer&s;e of God; and who, now &s;eparated from every in|firmity, dwell together in the deare&s;t amity and peace.</P>

That charm is LOVE, which, by exerci&s;ing every odious pa&s;&s;ion, and adorning us with its own cele&s;tial gra|ces, will &s;ecure our welcome, and ren|der us dear to every &s;aint in paradi&s;e.

Philander often now ob&s;erves to his friends, that nothing &s;urpri&s;es him more than the difference which he finds be|tween the feelings, of the pre&s;ent and pa&s;t periods of his life. That formerly, when a &s;tranger to love, the &s;ight of a battle was <HI>matter of fun</HI> to him; and a broken head, or a bloody no&s;e, a mere bagatelle, <HI>quite a trifle.</HI> But that now, were he compelled to &s;ee two men &s;tri|ving in battle, and with furious counte|nances and eyes darting hatred, inflict|ing cruel blows on each other, he verily believes it would harrow up his &s;oul

Now, if we who are but babes in love, and who&s;e hearts &s;till retain much of their former hardne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility, are, notwith&s;tanding, &s;o &s;hocked at the &s;ight of bad pa&s;&s;ions; how much more would the ble&s;&s;ed angels, tho&s;e pure &s;pirits of love, be &s;hocked at the &s;ight of &s;uch things? Hence, it clearly appears, that were God to throw open the gates of heaven, and to invite us to enter with all our pride, haughtine&s;s, &s;corn, envy and hatred about us; &s;o far from being welcome to the angels, we &s;hould turn their heaven into hell. It would grieve their generous bo&s;oms, to &s;ee us &s;o completely damned; and it would equal|ly &s;hock their feelings to &s;ee us &s;o per|fectly loath&s;ome and abominable; and they would, no doubt, prefer their joint petitions to God, for permi&s;&s;ion to re|tire

Here, the &s;trong pains and cries of tho&s;e whom we love, often wring our hearts and call tears of bittere&s;t &s;orrow from our eyes; but there, God &s;hall wipe all tears from our eyes, and pain and &s;ickne&s;s are unknown. Here, the pale cheek, the hollow eye, and trembling voice of langui&s;hing friends, often &s;icken our hearts, and pre&s;s our &s;pirits to the earth; but there, health blooms with fre&s;he&s;t ro&s;es on each im|mortal cheek, and imparts a vigor that &s;hall never know decay. Here, we often behold our deare&s;t relatives &s;truggling in the agonies of death, and hear, with &s;tupifying grief, their la&s;t expiring groans; but there, among tho&s;e holy angels, death never &s;hewed his gha&s;tly countenance, and their glorified bodies are deathle&s;s as the eternal Jehovah.

Now, what words can expre&s;s the joys of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed people, who love each other with a tenderne&s;s unknown to mortal bo&s;oms, and who&s;e love is con|tinually fea&s;ted with the view of each others happine&s;s, a happine&s;s which no time can terminate, and which neither man nor devil can impair! For perfect lovers have all their joys and griefs in common between them; but the heaven|ly lovers having no griefs among them, do only communicate their joys to one another. And where they love &s;o per|fectly as they do in heaven, there can be no &s;uch thing as a private or particular happine&s;s, but every one <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have a &s;hare in that of every one, and con&s;e|quently in this, their mutual communi|cation of joys, every one's happine&s;s, will, by his friend&s;hip to every one, be multiplied into as many happine&s;&s;es as there are &s;aints and angels in heaven; and thus, every joy, of every member

<P>WHAT eternal thanks do we not owe to the author of all good, for giving us &s;ouls that are capable of a&s;cending to the &s;ociety of the&s;e glorious beings, and of participating forever in their exalted delights?

<P>ST.

Adorned therefore with the friendly di&s;po&s;itions, the fair dealings, and gentle manners of this di|vine pa&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall not fail to find favour in the eyes of our neighbours, and to be beloved and care&s;&s;ed by them. Hence we walk among them as among brothers, in every face we &s;ee a friendly &s;mile, at every hou&s;e a hearty welcome, never devi&s;ing any mi&s;chief again&s;t them, we never dream of their devi&s;ing any again&s;t us.

melodious, our manners mild, our &s;leep &s;weet, and our whole life quiet and peaceable: And, as a ble&s;&s;ed con&s;e|quence of all this, together with the highe&s;t enjoyment of the pre&s;ent life, we are in the be&s;t frame of mind to prepare our&s;elves for that which is to come. Happily freed from the anxiety and vex|ation of all bad pa&s;&s;ions, we profitably contemplate our numberle&s;s obligations to love God and one another, and thus, in the multitude of our good thoughts, daily grow in virtue and piety.</P>
<P>BUT all this goodly Canaan, this land of love, flowing with riche&s;t milk and honey of peace, is &s;natched from our eyes by the demon-hand of hatred, and nought appears in its place but a land of darkne&s;s and of death, who&s;e &s;treams are of gall, and its fruits of bitter a&s;hes.</P>
<P>BY over-reaching a neighbour in a bargain (which we &s;hall be too apt to do if we love him not), we make him

In the meantime our natural re&s;t is di&s;turbed, our nece&s;&s;a|ry bu&s;ine&s;s is hindred, our happine&s;s in this life is utterly wretched and lo&s;t, and the great concerns of heaven and

eternal glory are entirely laid a&s;ide. O how much better it is to walk in the &s;mooth and flowery paths of love, than thus to wander in the rugged ways of hatred, overgrown with briars, and be|&s;et with &s;nares; to &s;ail gently down the cour&s;e of life on the &s;ilver current of friend&s;hip, than to be to&s;&s;ed on the tempe&s;tuous &s;ea of contention; to be|hold the lovely face of heaven &s;miling with a cheerful &s;erenity, than to &s;ee it frowning with clouds or raging with &s;torms! How much a peaceful &s;tate re|&s;embles heaven, into which no &s;trife nor clamor ever enter, but where ble&s;&s;ed &s;ouls conver&s;e together in perfect love, and perpetual concord! And how a condition of enmity re&s;embles hell, that black and di&s;mal region of dark hatred, fiery wrath, and horrible tumult!

<P>AND to conclude, let us remember, that "<HI>Love &s;hall never fail,</HI>" and that, the man of love "<HI>&s;hall be had in ever|la&s;ting remembrance, and his memory &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI>" No &s;pices can &s;o embalm a man, no monument can &s;o pre&s;erve his name, as works of love.

is no more &s;een, he remains vi&s;ible in the foot&s;teps and fruits of his good|ne&s;s. The poor man beholds him in the comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which he &s;till receives from his bounty. The &s;ick man feels him in the refre&s;hments which he yet enjoys from his charity. He &s;urvives in the hearts of the afflicted, who &s;till remember the &s;ervices which he rendered them &s;o cheerfully. And his weeping friends dry up their tears when they think of his virtues, the rich fruits of which they doubt not, he is now enjoying in a better world. <HI>His memory &s;hall likewi&s;e endure forever,</HI> in the favor of God, and in tho&s;e glorious rewards which he will be&s;tow upon him for his love to his brethren. <HI>God will not forget his labour of love,</HI> but will rai&s;e him up after the &s;hort &s;lumbers of the grave, to receive that unfading crown, and that precious pearl of eternal life:&mdash;"<HI>Well done good and faithful &s;ervant,&mdash;I</HI>
