<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE reason why a book of this kind although so much want|ed did not sooner appear, may be&mdash;because they who have been versed in science and literature, have not had practice and expe|rience in the arts; and they who have had practice and experimental knowledge, have not had time to acquire science and theory, those necessary qualifications for compleating the system, and which are not to be found in any one man. Sensible of my deficiences in both, I should not have undertaken it, was I not interested in the explanation of my own inventions. I have applied to such books and men of science as I expected assistance from, in forming a system of theory; and to practical mill-wrights and millers for the practice; but finding no authors who had joined practice and experience with theory, (except Smeaton whom I have quoted) finding many of their theories to be erroneous, and losing the as|sistance of the late ingenious William Waring, the only scientific character of my acquaintance, who acknowledged that he had in|vestigated the principles and powers of water acting on mill-wheels, I did not meet the aid I expected in that part.</P>
<P>Wherefore it is not safe to conclude that this work is without error&mdash;but that it contains many, both theoritical, practical, and grammatical; is the most natural, safe, and rational supposition. The reader whose mind is free and unbiassed by the opinion of others, will be most likely to attain the truth. Under a momen|tary discouragement, finding I had far exceeded the prescribed limits, and doubtful what might be its fate, I left out several ex|pensive draughts, of mills, &amp;c.&mdash;But since it went to press the prospects have become so encouraging that I may hope it will be well received: Therefore I request the reader, who may prove any part to be erroneous, can point out its defects, propose amend|ments, or additions; to inform me thereof by letter; that I may be enabled to correct, enrich, and enlarge it, in case it bears ano|ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lition, and I will gratefully receive their communications: For if what is kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> on these subjects by the different ingenious

practitioners in America could be collected in one work, it would be precious indeed, and a sufficient guide to save thousands of pounds from being uselessly expended. For a work of this kind will never be perfected by the abilities and labours of one man.</P>
<P>The practical part received from Thomas Ellicott will doubtless be useful, considering his long experience and known genius</P>
<P>Comparing this work with other original, difficult works, with equally expensive plates, the price will be found to be low.</P>

<HEAD>AXIOMS, or Self-evident Truths.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A body at rest will continue so for ever, un|less it is put in motion by some force impressed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This sluggish, inactive principle, or force, by which a body inclines to a state of rest, is called Inertia.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. A body in motion will continue so for ever, with the same velocity in the same direction, un|less resisted by some force.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The same principle of inertia, which inclines a body to remain at rest, also inclines it to continue in motion for ever, if once put in motion, and that in a right-lined direction, unless changed by some force; therefore no body, moving in a strait line, can be turned into a curve line, but by some force; the consideration of which may lead us to the knowledge of the true principles of some mills. See the latter part of art. 73.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="2" REF="028644_0010_0FDA297AF05127E8">
3. The impulse that gives motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 1.</NOTE> and the re|sistance that destroys it, are equal.</P>
<P N="4">4. Causes and effects are equal, or directly pro|portional.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 TYPE="postulates">
<HEAD>POSTULATUMS, or Positions without Proof.</HEAD>
<P>A quadruple impulse, or moving power, is re|quisite to communicate double velocity to a bo|dy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the course of this work, I shall shew, that a quadruple impulse pro|duces only double velocity: See art. 7 and 46. We should follow philoso|phers only in the paths of truth; because, if all men are subject to err&punc; even the most eminent philosophers may have erred.</P><P>If a theory will not agree with practice, we may suspect it is not true; and the theory of the momentum or force of bodies in motion, being as their velocities simply, does not agree with practice, with respect to the effects they produce, either in circular motion, art. 30, falling bodies, art. 9, spouting fluids, art. 45, wind on mill-sails, art. 69, therefore we have reason to suspect that this theory may not be true, in every respect.</P></NOTE>; therefore a quadruple resistance is requisite to destroy double velocity in a body, by axiom 3d.</P>
<P>The impulse we may call power, and the re|sistance that it overcomes, the effect produced by that power.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD>COROLLARY.</HEAD>
<P>Consequently, the powers of bodies in motion, to produce effects, are as the squares of their velo|cities; that is, a double velocity, in a moving bo|dy, produces 4 times the effect.</P>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Art. 2. OF THE PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two principles, which are the foundation of all mechanical motion and mechani|cal powers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Gravity and Elasticity; or Weight and Spring.</P>
<P>By one or the other of these principles or pow|ers every mechanical operation is performed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="028644_0011_0FDA297C2A360BA8">
Gravity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 2.</NOTE> in the extent of the word, means every species of attraction; but more especially that species which is common to, and mutual be|tween, all bodies; and is evident between the sun and its planetary attendants, as also the earth and moon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is this attraction of gravity between the heavenly bodies, that keeps up the order of their motion, in their revolutions round each other. See Ferguson's Lectures, page 23.</NOTE> But we will only consider it, as it relates to that tendency which all bodies on this earth has to fall towards its centre; thus far it concerns the mechanical arts, and its laws are as follows, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<DIV5 TYPE="laws of gravity">
<HEAD>Laws of Gravity.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Gravity is common to all bodies, and mutual between them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is in proportion to the quantity of matter in bodies.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is exerted every way from the centre of attracting bodies, in right-lined directions; there|fore all bodies on the earth tend to the centre of gravity of the earth.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The centre of gravity of a body, is that point on which, if the body be suspended, it will remain at rest in any position; or it is the centre of the whole weight or matter of the body. Art. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. It decreases as the squares of the distance in|crease; that is, if a body, on the earth, was to be removed to double the distance from the centre of gravity of the earth, about 4000 miles high, it would there have but 1-4 of the gravity or weight it had when on the ground: but a small height from the surface of the earth (50,100, or 500 feet) will make no sensible difference in gra|vity.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The diameter of the earth is allowed to be about 8000 miles; there|fore we may suppose the centre of gravity of the earth to be about 4000 miles from its surface; and any small distance from its surface, such as 1 mile high, will make no sensible difference in gravity. But when the dis|tance is so great as to bear a considerable proportion to the distance of the centre of gravity of the earth, then the power of gravity will decrease sensibly. Thus, at the distance of the moon, which, at a mean, is about 60 semi-diameters of the earth, the power of gravity is to that on the sur|face of the earth, as 1 to 3600. See Martin's Philosophy.</NOTE></P>
<P>

<HEAD>Art. 3. ELASTICITY.</HEAD>
<P>Elasticity is that strength or power, which any body or quantity of matter, being confined or compressed, has to expand itself; such as a spring that is bent or wound up, heated air or steam con|fined in a vessel, &amp;c. and by it many mechanical operations are performed.</P>
<P>Elasticity, in the full sense of the word, here means every species of repulsion.</P>
<P>The limits of the prodigious power of repulsion, which takes place between the particles of heated air and steam, are not yet known. Their effects are seen in the explosion of gunpowder, the burst|ing and cracking of wood in the fire, &amp;c. In short, in every instance, where steam could not find room to expand itself, it has burst the vessel that confined it, endangering the lives of those who were near it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>A worthy and ingeuius young man, having prepared a vessel of wrought iron, about 3 inches diameter, and 9 inches long, partly filled with water, had put it into a smith's fire, and was trying some experiments, when the aperture. by which the steam was meant to issue, got stopped by some means (as is supposed) and the vessel burst with noise like a cannon, carried off his right arm, and left it laying across one of the upper beams of the shop, and otherwise desperately wounded him. This prodigious power is applied to raise water out of coal-mines, &amp;c. from great depths, in sur|prising quantities, and to turn mills; it may (in my opinion) be applied to many other useful purposes, which it is not yet applied to.</P>

I have tried the experiment, by causing different weights to strike each other with different velocities, both on the principle of pendulums, and by causing them to move in horizontal circles; and, in both cases, 4lbs. with velocity 1, ba|lanced 2lbs. with velocity 2; their momentums each were 4: so that the theory appears to be proved to be true. Yet I think we have reason to doubt its being true in any other sense; because it does not agree with prac|tice. All the bodies we put in motion, to produce effects, produce them in proportion to the squares of their velocities, or nearly, as will appear in the course of this work: But I fear I shall draw on me the ridicule of some, if I should doubt a theory long established; but I think we should follow others only in the paths of truth. Doubtless Sir Isaac meant the force to be instantly spent: and I have understood that the Dutch and Italian philoso|phers have held and taught, these 100 years past, that the momentum of bo|dies in motion, is as the squares of their velocities; and I must confess it appears to be really the case, with respect to the effects they produce; which is generally as their quantity or weight multiplied into the squares of their velocities. I found it impossible to reconcile the theory of the force of bodies in motion, being as their simple velocities, to the laws of circular motion, art. 13, where a double velocity produces a quadruple central force; of falling bodies, art. 9, where the velocity is as the square root of the impulse or dis|tance fallen, and the effects as the squares of the velocities; of projectiles, where a double velocity produces a quadruple random, art. 12; of bodies descending on inclined plains, art. 10, where the velocities are as the square roots of the perpendicular descents, and the effects as the squares of their velocities; of spouting fluids, art. 45, where their velocities are as the square roots of their perpendicular heights or pressures, and their effects as the squares of their velocities, with equal quantities; of wind on mill-falls, art. 69, where the effects are as the cube of the velocity of the wind; because here the quantity is as the velocity, and the effect of equal quantities being as the squares of the velocity, amounts the effects to be as the cubes.</P><P>But when I discovered that a quadruple impulse was requisite to give double velocity, both in falling bodies and spouting fluids, and, by axiom 3, the power that produced a motion in a body, and the power that destroyed said motion, were equal, I concluded that the effects produced by bodies in motion, were as the squares of their velocities; and then I found the whole theory to agree with practice. Hereafter I shall say, that the effective mo|mentum, or force of bodies in motion, is as the squares of their velo|cities.</P></NOTE></P>

If a perfect elastic body be let fall 4 feet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 8.</NOTE> to strike a perfect elastic plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A double velo|city produces a quadruple effect.</NOTE> by the laws of falling bodies, art. 9, it will strike the plain with a ve|locity of 16, 2 feet per second, and rise, by its re-action, to the same height from whence it fell, in half a second: If it falls 16 feet, it will strike with a velocity of 32, 4 feet, and rise 16 feet in one second. Now, if we call the rising of the body the effect, we shall find that a double velo|city, in this case, produces a quadruple effect in double time.

But if each pound of matter move with double velocity, it will produce 4 times the effect, but requires a dou|ble time; which difference in time no way affects the sum total of the ef|fects of the matter put in motion to move any practical machine.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">6-10ths of power lost by non-elasticity.</NOTE> as proved in art. 67; by experiment, and demonstrated by art. 46; then the ratio of the force of this side velocity, 12,64 feet per second, is to the force of forward velocity, as 160 to 256, more than half (about, 6) of the whole force is here lost by non-elasti|city.</P>
<P N="6">6. This side force cannot be applied to produce any further forward force, after it has struck the first obstacle; because its action and re-action ba|lance each other afterwards: which I demonstrate by fig. 27.</P>
<P>Let A be an obstacle, against which the column of water G A, of quantity 16 and velocity per second 16, strikes; as it strikes A, suppose it to change its direction, at right angles, with 3-4 ve|locity, and strike B B; then change again, and strike forward against C C, and backwards against D D; then again in the side direction E E; and again in the forward and backward directions all of which counteract each other, and balance exactly.</P>
<P>Therefore, if we suppose the obstacle A to be the float of an undershot water-wheel, the water can be of no further service, in propelling it, after the first impulse, but rather a disadvantage; be|cause the elasticity of the float will cause it to re|bound in a certain degree, and not keep fully up with the float it struck, but re-act back against the float following; therefore it will be better to let it escape freely as soon as it has fully made the stroke, but not sooner, as it will require a certain

Again if it fall 64 Feet, it will strike with velocity 64, and produce a quadruple effect, in a double time; because, if a perfectly elastic body fall 16 feet in one second of time, and strike a per|fectly elastic plain, with velocity 32 feet, it will rise 16 feet in one second of time. Again, if the body fall two seconds of time, it will fall 64 feet, and strike with velocity 64, and rise 64 feet in two seconds of time. Now, if we call the rising of the body the effect of the striking velocity (which it really is) then all will appear clearly.

9th.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 9.</NOTE> The resistance they meet with in any given time, in passing through a resisting medium, is as their surfaces, and as the cubes of their ve|locities.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is evident when we consider,</P><P N="1">1.

Compare this with the effect of wind on mill-sails, proved by experiment, to be as the cubes of the velocity, Art. 69, and with the effects of spouting fluids, proved to be as the cubes of their velocities, with equal apertures.

<P>Again, consider that the solid content of bodies decreases, as the cubes of their diameters, while their surfaces decrease only as the squares of their diameters; Consequently the smaller the body, the greater the resist|ance, in proportion to its weight: and this is the reason why heavy bodies, reduced to dust, will float in the air; as, likewise, feathers, and many other bodies of great surface and little matter. This seems to show, that air is, perhaps, as heavy as any other matter whatever, of an equal degree of fineness or smallness of particles.</P><P>These are the laws of falling bodies supposing them to fall in vacuo, or in an unresisting medium; and without considering that gravity increases, as the square of the distance from the center of gravity of the attracting power decreases (4. law of gravity, art. 2;) because any small distance, such as comes in our practice, will make no sensible difference. But as they fall in the air, which is a medium of great resistance, the instant resistance is as the opposing surfaces of the falling body, and as the squares of their ve|locities, their motion will greatly differ from these laws, in falling great distances, or with light bodies; but in small distances, such as 30 feet or less, and heavy bodies, the difference will be imperceptable in common practice.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>A Lever is a bar of iron, wood, &amp;c. one part of which is supported by a prop, and all other parts turn or move on that prop, as their centre of motion; and its length, on each side of the prop, is called its arms: the velocity or motion of every part of these arms, is directly as its dis|tance from its centre of motion, by 3d law of cir|cular motion.</P>

<HEAD>Art. 32. Of reducing Friction.</HEAD>
<P>TO reduce friction, we must, by mechanical contrivances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To reduce friction.</NOTE> reduce the motion of the rubbing parts as much as possible; which is done, either by making the gudgeons small and the diameter of wheels large, or by fixing the gudgeons to run o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> friction-wheels.<NOTE PLACE="marg">By friction wheels.

<HEAD>Art. 33. Late Invention to reduce Friction.</HEAD>
<P>WHEEL-CARRIAGES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rollers appli|ed to reduce friction.</NOTE> pullies, and such wheels as have large axles in proportion to their diameters, have much friction. There has been a late discovery, in England, of applying the prin|ciple of the roller to them; which may be so done as almost totally to destroy the friction.</P>
<P>The easiest method possible, of moving heavy bodies horizontally, is the roller.</P>
<P>Let A B, fig. 15,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 15.</NOTE> represent a body of 100 tons weight (with the underside perfectly smooth and even) set on two rollers, perfectly hard, smooth, and round, rolling on the horizontal plain C D,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No friction in rollers.</NOTE> perfectly hard, smooth, and even; it is evident that this body is supported by two lines perfectly perpendicular, and, if globes were used instead of rollers, the least force would move it in any horizontal direction; even a spider's web would be sufficient, giving it time to overcome the visinertia of the body: But as perfect hard|ness, smoothness, &amp;c. are not attainable, a little friction will still remain.</P>
<P>This principle is, or may be, applied to wheel-carriages, in the following manner:</P>
<P>Let the outside ring B C D, fig. 16,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig.16.</NOTE> represent the box of a carriage-wheel, the inside circle A the axle, the circles a a a a a a the rollers round the axle between it and the box, and the inner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ring a thin plate for the pivots of the rollers to run in, to keep them at a proper distance from each other. When the wheel turns the rollers pass round on the axle, and on the inside of the box, and we may say without friction, because there is no rubbing of the parts past one another.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To explain this, let us suppose the rollers aaaaaa to have cogs, and the shaft A, and box to have cogs also, the rollers gearing into the shaft and into the inside of the box. Now it is evident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The princi|ples of the ap|plication of rollers ex|plained.</NOTE> that if the box will turn round the axle, it must be without any sliding of parts; (and in fact, the prominent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the rollers, axle and box, will act as cogs) then, if the rollers and axle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all of one diameter, they will have an equal number of cogs; and as the dia|meter of the box will be 3 times the diameter of the rollers, it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 3 times a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> many cogs. Now it is evident, that the axle must turn 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> times round, before the same cogs of the rollers and shaft will meet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were together when it started; because, in that time the rollers will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> moved over 1-3 of the box: therefore the axle must turn 3 3-3 times equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 4 times round, by the time the box is once measured by the rollers. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> suppose we hold the axle at rest, and turn the box round like a carriage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> then, while the box turns 1 1-3 times round the axle, it will cause the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to move once round; and while the box or wheel turns round the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> times, the rollers will run round it three times.

<P>The theory published by philosophers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old theory of maximum, motion, and load of en|gines.</NOTE> and re|ceived and taught as true, for several centuries past, is, that any machine will work with its greatest perfection when it is charged with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

4-9 of the power that would hold it in equilibrio,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 34.</NOTE> and then its velocity will be just 1-3 of the great|est velocity of the moving power.</P>
<P>To explain this, they suppose the water-wheel, fig.17,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 17.</NOTE> to be of the undershot kind, 16 feet dia|meter, turned by water issuing from under a 4 feet head, with a gate 1. foot wide, 1 foot high drawn; then the force will be 250lbs. because that is the weight of the column of water above the gate, and its velocity will be 16,2 feet per second, as shall be shewn under the head of Hydraulics; then the wheel will be moved by a power of 250lbs. and if let run empty, will move with a velocity of 16 feet per second; but if we hang the weight W to the axle (of 2 feet diameter) with a rope, and continue to add to it until it stops the wheel, and holds it in equilibrio, the weight will be found to be 2000lbs. by the rule, art. 19; and then the effect of the machine is nothing, because the velocity is nothing: But as we decrease the weight W, the wheel begins to move, and its velocity increases accordingly; and then the pro|duct of the weight multiplied into its velocity, will increase until the weight is decreased to 4-9 of 2000=888,7, which, multiplied into its dis|tance moved or velocity, will produce the great|est effect, and the velocity of the wheel will then be 1-3 of 16 feet, or 5,33 feet per second. So say those who have treated of it.</P>
<P>This will appear plainer to a young learner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theory of maximums explained by application of an elevator. Fig. 17.</NOTE> if he will conceive this wheel to be applied to work an elevator, as E, fig. 17, to hoist wheat, and suppose that the buckets, when all full, contain 9 pecks, and will hold the wheel in equilibrio, it is evident it will then hoist none, because it has no motion; then, in order to obtain motion, we must lessen the quantity in the buckets, when the wheel will begin to move, and hoist faster and

<HEAD>Art. 35. Old Theory investigated.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to investigate this theory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Investigation of the old theory.</NOTE> and the better to understand what has been said, let us consider as follows, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. That the velocity of spouting water, under 4 feet head, is 16 feet per second, nearly.</P>
<P N="2">2. The section or area of the gate drawn, in feet, multiplied by the height of the head in feet, gives the cubic feet in the whole column, which multiplied by 62,5 (the weight of a cubic foot of water) gives the weight or force of the whole column pressing on the wheel.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the radius of the wheel, multiplied by the force, and that product divided by the radius of the axle, gives the weight that will hold the wheel in equilibrio.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the absolute velocity of the wheel, subtracted from the absolute velocity of the wa|ter, leaves the relative velocity with which the water strikes the wheel in motion.</P>
<P N="5">5. That as the radius of the wheel is to the ra|dius of the axle, so is the velocity of the wheel to the velocity of the weight hoisted on the axle.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="51" REF="028644_0059_0FDA2A1CC9FA0420">
6. That the effects of spouting fluids are as the squares of their velocities (see art. 45, law 6) but the instant force of striking fluids,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 35.</NOTE> are as their velocities simply. See art. 8.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the weight hoisted, multiplied into its perpendicular ascent, gives the effect.</P>
<P N="8">8. That the weight of water expended, multi|plied into its perpendicular descent, gives the power used per second.</P>
<P>On these pinciples I have calculated the follow|ing scale; first supposing the force of striking fluids to be as the square of their striking or rela|tive velocity, which brings out the maximum a|greeably to the old theory, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>When the load, at equilibrio, is 2000, then the maximum load is 888,7=4/9; of 2000, when the effect is at its greatest, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 591,98, as appears in the 6th column, and then the velocity of the wheel is 5,333 feet per second, equal to 1-3 of 16, the velocity of the water, as appears in the 5th line of the scale: but as there is an evi|dent error in the first principle of this theory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old theory doubted.</NOTE> by counting the instant force of the water on the wheel to be as the square of its striking velocity, therefore it cannot be true. See art. 41.</P>
<P>I then calculate upon this principle, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That the instant force of striking fluids is as their velo|city simply, then the load that the machine will carry, with its different velocities, will be as the velocity simply, as appears in the 7th column, and the load, at a maximum, is 1000lb=&frac12; of 2000, the load at equilibrio, when the velocity of the wheel is 8 feet=&frac12; of 16 the velocity of the water per second; and then the effect is at its greatest, as shewn in the 8th column, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 1000, as appears in the 4th line of the scale.</P>
<P>This I call the new theory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New theory.</NOTE> (because I found that William Waring had also, about the same time, established it, see art. 38) <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That when
<PB N="52" REF="028644_0060_0FDA2A1FB89AD458">
any machine is charged with just 1-2 of the load that will hold it in equilibrio,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 35.</NOTE> its velocity will be just 1-2 of the natural velocity of the moving power, and then its effect will be at a maximum, or greatest possible.</P>
<P>This appears to be the way by which this great error has been so long overlooked by philosophers, and which has rendered the theory of no use in practice, but led many into expensive errors, thereby bringing great discredit upon philoso|phy.</P>

And as the subject is of the greatest consequence in prac|tical mechanics.

Or the proposition is manifest from this consi|deration, that while the stream is invariable, whatever be the velocity of the wheel, the same number of particles, or quantity of the fluid, must strike it somewhere or other in a given time; con|sequently, the variation of the force is only on account of the varied impingent velocity of the same body, occasioned by a change of motion in the wheel; that is, the momentum is as the rela|tive velocity.</P>
<P>Now this true principle, substituted for the er|roneous one in use, will bring the theory to agree remarkably with the notable experiments of the ingenius Smeaton, published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, for the year 1751, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">I; for which the honorary annual medal was adjudged by the society, and presented to the author by their president.</P>

<HEAD>Art: 41. Search for a true Theory, commenced on a new Plan.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears, that we have applied wrong prin|ciples in our search after a true theory of the max|imum velocity and load of undershot water-wheels, or other engines moved by a constant power, that does not increase or decrease in quantity on the engine, as on an overshot water-wheel, as the ve|locity varies.</P>
<P>Let us suppose water to issue from under a head of 16 feet, on an undershot water-wheel; then, if the wheel moves freely with the water, its velo|city will be 32, 4 feet per second; but will bear no load.</P>
<P>Again, suppose we load it, so as to reduce its motion to be equal the velocity of water spouting from under 15 feet; it appears evident that the load will then be just equal to that 1 foot of the head, the velocity of which is checked; and this load multiplied into the velocity of the wheel, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 31, 34&times;1=31,34 for the effect.</P>

Now let us suppose the water to strike the wheel at I, then, if we let the wheel move free|ly without any load, it will move with the velo|city of the water, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 32,4 feet per second, but will produce no effect, if the water issue at C; al|though there be 32,4 cubic feet of water expend|ed, under 16 feet perpendicular descent. Let the weight of a cubic foot of water be represented by unity or 1, for ease in counting; then 32,4&times;16 will shew the power expended, per second, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 518,4; and the water it hoists multiplied into its perpendicular ascent, or height hoisted, will shew the effect. Then, in order to obtain effect from the power, we load the wheel; the simplest way of doing which, is, to cause the tube of water C D to act on the back of the bucket at I; then, if CD be equal to AB, the wheel will be held in equili|brio; this is the greatest load, and the whole of the fall AB is balanced, and no part left to give the wheel velocity; therefore the effect=0. But if we make C D=12 feet of A B, then from 4 to A=4 feet, is left unbalanced, to give velocity to the wheel, which is now loaded with 12 feet, and

Then suppose we open gates of 1 foot area, at different heights, the velocity will shew the quantity of cubic feet raised; which multiplied by the per|pendicular height of the gate from C, or height raised, gives the effect as before, and the maxi|mum as before. But here we must consider, that in both these cases, the water acts as a perfect definite quantity, which will produce effects equal to elastic bodies, or equal to its gravity (see art.59) which is impracticable in practice: Whereas when it acts by percussion only, it communicates only half of its original force, on account of its non-elasticity, the other half being spent in splashing about (see art. 8); therefore the true effect will be 33/100,(a little more than 1-3) of the moving pow|er; because nearly 1-3 is lost to obtain velocity, and half of the remaining 2-3 is lost by non-elasti|city. These are the reasons, why the effects pro|duced by an undershot wheel is only half of that produced by an overshot wheel, the perpendicu|lar descent and quantity of water being equal. And this agrees with Smeaton's experiments (see art.68); but if we suppose the velocity of the wheel to be 1-3 that of the water-10,8, and the load to be 4-9 of 16, the greatest load at equilibrio; which is-7, 111, as by old theory, then the effect will be 10,8&times;4-9 of 16-76,79 for the effect, which is quite too little, the moving power be|ing 32,4 cubic feet of water, multiplied by 16 feet descent-518,4, the effect by this theory be|ing less than , 15/100 of the power, about half equal to the effect by experiment, which effect is set on the outside of the dotted circle in the fig.(19.) The dotted lines join the corner of the parallelo|grams, formed by the lines that represent the loads and velocities, in each experiment or sup|position, the areas of which truly represent the effect, and the dotted line A a d x, meeting the

<P>Again, if we suppose the wheel to move w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> half the velocity of the water, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 16,2 feet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> second, and be loaded with half the greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">=8, according to Waring's theory, then the ef|fect will be 16,2&times;8=129,6 for the effect, abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> 23/100 of the power, which is still less than by ex|periment.

<HEAD>Art. 43. Of the Maximum velocity for Overshot Wheels, or those that are moved by the weight of the Wa|ter.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I dismiss the subject of maximums, I think it best to consider, whether this doctrine will apply to the motion of the overshot wheels. It seems to be the general opinion of those, who consider the matter, that it will not; but, that the slower the wheel moves, provided it be ca|pacious enough to hold all the water, without losing any until it be delivered at the bottom of the wheel, the greater will be the effect, which appears to be the case in theory (see art. 36); but how far this theory will hold good in practice, is to be considered. Having met with the ingeni|ous James Smeaton's experiments, where he shews, that, when the circumference of his lit|tle wheel, of 24 inches diameter, (head 6 inches) moved with about 3,1 feet per second (although the greatest effect was diminished about 1/20 of the whole) he obtained the best effect, with a steady, regular motion. Hence he concludes about 3 feet to be the best velocity for the circumference of overshot mills. See art. 68. I undertook to compare this theory of his, with the best mills

Hence appears the reason why some wheels cast their water, which is always the case, when the head is not sufficient to give it velocity enough to enter the buckets. But this depends also much on the po|sition of the buckets, and direction of the shute into them. It, however, appears evident that the head of water above the wheel, should be nicely adjusted, to suit the velocity of the wheel. Here we may consider, that the head above the wheel acts by percussion, or on the same principles with the undershot wheel, and, as we have shewn (art. 41) that the undershot wheel should move with nearly 2-3 of the velocity of the water, it appears, that we should allow a head over the wheel, that will give such velocity to the water, as will be to that of the wheel as 3 to 2. Thus the whole descent of the water of a mill-seat should be nicely divided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole descent must be nicely di|vided be|tween head and fall.</NOTE> between head and fall, to suit each other, in order to obtain the best effect, and a steady-moving mill. First find the velocity that the wheel will move with, by the weight of the water, for any diameter you may suppose you will take for the wheel, and divide said velocity into two parts; then try if your head is such, as will cause the water to come on with a velocity of 3 such parts, mak|ing due allowances for the friction of the water, according to the aperture. See art. 55. Then, if the buckets and direction of the shute be right, the wheel will receive the water well, and move to the best advantage, keeping a steady, regular motion when at work, loaded or charged with a resistance equal to 2-3 of its power, (art. 41. 42.)</P>

<HEAD>Art. 44. Application of the doctrine of maxi|mums.</HEAD>
<P>THIS doctrine of maximums is very interest|ing, and is to be met with in many occurrences through life.</P>
<P N="1">1. It has been shewn, that there is a maximum load and velocity for all engines, to suit the pow|er and velocity of the moving power.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is also a maximum size, velocity and feed for mill-stones, to suit the power; and velo|city for rolling-screens, and bolting-reels, by which the greatest work can be done in the best manner, in a given time.</P>
<P N="3">3. A maximum degree of perfection and close|ness, with which grain is to be manufactured in|to flour, so as to yield the greatest profit by the mill in a day or week, and this maximum is con|tinually changing with the prices in the market, so that what would be the greatest profit at one time, will sink money at another. See art. 113.</P>
<P N="4">4. A maximum weight for mallets, axes, sledges, &amp;c. according to the strength of those that use them.</P>

Therefore by this law we can find the velocity of water spouting from un|der any given head; for as the square root of 4 equal 2 is to 16,2 its veloci|ty, so is the square root of 16 equal 4, to 32,4 its velocity.

Again, suppose we open a gate of 1 square foot at A 16 under 16 feet head, it will strike the large wheel at k, with velocity 32, its instant force or pressure being 16 cubic feet of water, it will require 16 cubic feet resistance, from the head C 16, to stop or balance it. In this case the

<P N="3">3. Again, suppose the head C 16 to be raised to E, 16 feet above 4, and a gate drawn &frac14; of a square foot, then the instant pressure on the float I of the small wheel, will be 4 cubic feet, pressing on &frac14; of a square foot, and will exactly balance 4 cu|bic feet, pressing on 1 square foot, from the head A 16; and the wheel will be in equilibrio, (sup|posing the water cannot escape until the wheel moves as before) although the one has power of velocity 32, and the other only 16 feet per se|cond. Their loads at equilibrio are equal, conse|quently their loads at a maximum velocity and charge, will be equal, but their velocities differ|ent.</P>
<P>Then, to try their effects, suppose, first, the wheel to move by the 4 feet head, its maximum velocity to be half the velocity of the water, which is 16, and its maximum load to be half its greatest load, which is 4, by Waring's theory; then the velocity 16&verbar;2 &times; by the load 4&verbar;2=16, the effect of the 4 feet head, with 16 cubic feet expended; because the velocity of the water is 16, and the gate 1 foot.</P>
<P>Again, suppose it to move by the 16 feet head and gate of &frac14; of a foot; then the velocity 32&verbar;2X by the load 4&verbar;2=32, the effect, with but 8 cu|bic feet expended, because the velocity of the water is 32, and the gate but &frac14; of a foot.</P>
<P>In this case the instant forces are equal, each being 4; but the one moving a body only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as heavy as the other, moves with velocity 32, and produces effect 32, while the other, moving with velocity 16, produces effect 16.

momentums of bodies in motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 47.</NOTE> are as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> quantities, multiplied into their simple velocities, and this I call the instant momentums.</P>
<P>But when we consider, that in the above case, it was the quantity of matter put in motion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> water expended, that produced the effect, we find that the quantity 16, with velocity 16, pro|duced effect 16; while qu. 8, with velocity 32 produced effect 32.

<P>Again, if the quantity expended under each head, had been equal, their effects would have been 16 and 64, which is as the squares of their velocities, 16 and 32.</P>
<P N="4">4. Again, suppose both wheels to be on one shaft, and let a gate of &frac12; of a square foot be drawn at 16 C, to strike the wheel at k, the head being 16 feet, the instant pressure on the gate will be 2 cu|bic feet of water, which is half of the 4 feet head with 1 foot gate, from A 4 striking at I; but the 16 feet head, with instant pressure 2, acting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the great wheel, will balance 4 feet on the small one, because the lever is of double length, and the wheels will be in equilibrio. Then, by Wa|ring's theory, the greatest load of the 16 feet head being 2, its load at a maximum will be 4 and the velocity of the water being 32, the max|imum velocity of the wheel will be 16. Now the velocity 16&times;1=16, the effect of the 16 feet head, and gate of 1/8 of a foot.

But when we consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 47.</NOTE> that in this case, the 4 feet head expended 16 cubic feet of water, with velocity 16, and produced effect 16; while the 16 feet head expended only 4 cubic feet of water, with velocity 32, and produced effect 16, we find, that the effects are as their quantities, multiplied into the squares of their velocities.</P>
<P>And when we consider, that the gate of &frac13; of a square foot, with velocity 32, produced effects equal to the gate of 1 square foot, with velocity 16, it is evident, that if we make the gates equal, the effects will be as 8 to 1; that is, the effects of spouting fluids, with equal apertures, are as the cubes of their velocities; because, their instant forces are as the squares of their velocities by 6th law.</P>

<P>Find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rule for find|ing the effect of any gate, drawn under any head on an undershot wheel.</NOTE> by theorem I. (art. 50) the instantane|ous pressure of the water, which is the load at equilibrio, and &frac23; thereof is the maximum load, which, multiplied by ,577 of the velocity of the water, under the given head, (found by theo. II.) produces the effect.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROBLEM.</HEAD>
<P>Given, the head 16 feet, gate 4 feet wide, 25 of a foot drawn, required the effect on an un|dershot wheel, per second. The measure of the effect to be the quantity, multiplied into its dis|tance moved, (velocity) or into its perpendicular ascent.</P>
<P>Then, by theorem I. (art. 50) 4X,25=1 square foot, the area of the gate &times;16=16 the cubic feet pressing; but, for the sake of round numbers, we call each cubic foot 1, and although 32,4 cubic feet strike the wheel per second, yet, on ac|count of non-elasticity, only 16 cubic feet is the load at equilibrio, and &frac23; of 16 is 10,666, the max|imum load.</P>
<P>Then, by theorem II. the velocity is 32, 4,,577 of which is=18,71, the maximum velocity of the wheel X 10,66, the load=199,4, the effect.</P>
<P>This agrees with Smeaton's observations, where he says, (art. 67) "It is somewhat remarkable, that though the velocity of the wheel, in relation to the velocity of the water, turn out to be more than 1/3, yet the impulse of the water, in case of the maximum, is more than double of what is assigned by theory; that is, instead of 4/8; of the column, it is nearly equal to the whole column." Hence I conclude, that non-elasticity does not operate so much against this application, as to
<PB N="92" REF="028644_0100_0FDA2BD42BCEC860">
reduce the load to be less than &frac23;. And when we consider, that 32,4 cubic feet of water, or a co|lumn 32,4 feet long, strike the wheel while it moves only 18,71 feet, the velocity of the wheel being to the velocity of the water as 577 to 1000. May not this be the reason why the load is just 2/3 of the head, which brings the effect to be just ,38 (a little more than 1/3 of the power.) This I admit, because it agrees with experiment, altho' it be difficult to assign the true reason thereof. See annotation, art. 42.</P>
<P>Therefore ,577 the velocity of the water=18,71, multiplied by 2/3 of 16, the whole column, or instantaneous pressure, pressing on the wheel&mdash;art. 50&mdash;which is 10,66, produces 199,4, the effect. This appears to be the true effect, and if so the true theorem will be as follows, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<P>Then 16 cubic feet, the column, multiplied by 2/3=10,66, the load, which, multiplied by 18,71, the velocity of the wheel, produces 199,4, for the effect; and if we try different heads and dif|ferent apertures, we find the effects to bear the ratio to each other, that is agreeable to the laws of spouting fluids.</P>

<P N="3">3. By a perfectly definite quantity, we mean a quantity passing along a close tube so confined, that when it strikes the float it has not liberty to escape in any lateral direction.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"> Indefinite quantity of water ap|plied</NOTE> when a float of a wheel is struck by an indefinite quantity, the float is struck by a co|lumn of water, the section of which is equal to the area of the float; and as this column is con|fined on every side by the surrounding water, which has equal motion, it cannot escape freely sideways; therefore more of its force is commu|nicated to the float than would be, in case it had free liberty to escape sideways in every direction.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Definite quan|tity applied.</NOTE> The float being struck by definite quantity, with liberty to escape freely in every side direction, it acts as the most perfect non-elas|tic body; therefore (by art. 8) it communicates only a part of its force, the other part being spent in the lateral direction.

But if they will consider well the principles of gravity act|ing on falling bodies (art. 9) they will find, that, if the velocity of a falling body be ever so great, the action of gravity is still the same to cause it to move faster, so that, although an overshot wheel may move before the power of the gravity, of the water thereon, yet no impulse downwards can give a wheel such velocity, as that the gravi|ty of the water acting thereon can be lessened thereby.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If gravity could be either decreased by velocity downwards, or increas|ed by velocity upwards, then a virtical wheel without friction, either of gud|geons or air, would require a great force to continue its motion; because, its velocity would decrease the gravity of its descending side, and increase it on its ascending side, which would immediately stop it: whereas it is known, that it requires no power to continue its motion, but what is necessary to overcome the friction of the gudgeons, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Hence it appears, that when a greater head is used,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Direct the wa|ter down|wards when there is too much head, on overshot, pitch-back, or breast wheels.</NOTE> than what is necessary to shoot the water fairly into the wheel, the impulse should be direct|ed downward a little as at D (which is called pitch-back) and have a circular sheeting to pre|vent the water from leaving the wheel, because if it be shot horizontally on the top of the wheel, the impulse in that case will not give the water any greater velocity downwards, then, in this case, the fall would be lost, if the head was very great, and the wheel moved to suit the velocity of the impulse, the water would be thrown out of the buckets by the centrifugal force; and if we attempt to retard the wheel, so as to retain the water the mill will be so ticklish and unsteady, that it will be almost impossible to attend it.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="028644_0114_0FDA2AD24BFD7D10">
Hence may appear the reason why breast-wheels generally run quicker than overshots, al|though the fall after the water strikes be not so great.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is generally more head allowed to breast-mills than overshots, and the wheel will incline to move with nearly 2/3 the velocity of the water, spouting from under the head, (art. 41).</P>

If the water was permitted to fall freely after it issues from the gate, it would be accele|rated by the fall, so that its velocity at the low|est point, would be equal to its velocity, had it spouted from under a head equal to its whole per|pendicular descent. This accelerated velocity of the water, tends to accelerate the wheel; hence, to find the velocity of a breast-wheel, where the water is struck on in a tangent direc|tion as in fig. 31, 32, I deduce the following.</P>

<P>THE only loss of power sustained by using too much head, in the application of water to turn a mill-wheel, is from the head producing only half its power.

<DIV5 TYPE="explanation">
<HEAD>Of the different quantity of Surfaces that are passed by Mill-stones of different diameters with different velocities.</HEAD>
<P>Supposing the quantity ground by mill-stones and power required to turn them to be as the pas|sing surfaces of their faces, each superficial foot that passes over another foot requires a certain power to grind a certain quantity: Then to explain this let us premise,</P>
<P N="1">1. The circumference and diameter of circles are directly proportional. That is, a double dia|meter gives a double circumference.</P>
<P N="2">2. The areas of circles are as the squares of their diameters. That is, a double diameter gives 4 times the area.</P>
<P N="3">3. The square of the diameter of a circle mul|tiplied by ,7854 gives its area.</P>
<P N="4">4. The square of the area of a mill-stone multi|plied by its number of revolutions, gives the sur|face passed. Consequently,</P>
<P N="5">5. Stones of unequal diameters revolving in equal times. Their passing surfaces, quantity ground, and power required to drive them, will be as the squares of their areas, or as the biquadrate of their diameters. That is, a double diameter will pass 16 times the surface.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The diameter of a 4 feet stone squared, multiplied by ,7854 equal 12,56 its area; which squared is 157,75 feet, the surface passed at one re|volution: and 8 multiplied by 8 equal 64, which multiplied by ,7854 equal 50,24 being the area of an 8 feet stone; which squared is 2524,04 the the surface passed, which surfaces are as 1 to 16.</NOTE></P>
<P N="6">6. If the velocity of their mean circles or cir|cumferences be equal their passing surfaces, quan|tity
<PB N="120" REF="028644_0128_0FDA2B0DDEE78790">
ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 63.</NOTE> and power required to move then will be as the cubes of their diameters.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Because the 8 feet stone will revolve only half as often as the 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> therefore their quantity of surface passed, &amp;c. can be only half as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more as it was in the last case; that is as 8 to 1.</NOTE></P>
<P N="7">7. If the diameters and velocities be unequal their passing surfaces and quantity ground, &amp;c. will be as the squares of their areas, multiplied by their revolutions.</P>
<P N="8">8. If their diameters be equal the quantity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> surfaces passed, &amp;c. are as their velocities or revo|lutions simply.</P>
<P>But we have been supposing theory and prac|tice to agree strictly which they will by no me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> do in this case. The quantity ground and power used by large stones more than by small ones <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not be in the ratio assigned by the theory; be|cause the meal having to pass a greater distance through the stone, is operated upon often<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> which operations must be lighter, else it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> overdone; by which means large stones may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> equal quantities with small ones, and with equal power, and do it with less pressure; therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> flour will be better.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A French author (M. Fabre) says, that by experiments he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound that to produce the best flour, a stone 5 feet diameter should revolve be|tween 48 and and 61 times in a minute. This is much slower than prac|tice in America, but we may conclude that it is best to err on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> slower than faster than common practice; especially when the power is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> small for the size of the stone.</NOTE> See art. III.</P>
<P>From these considerations added to experi|ments I conclude, that the power required <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quantity ground, will nearer approach to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the area of the stones, multiplied into the veloci|ty of the mean circles; or, which is nearly the same: As the squares of their diameters. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the velocities of their mean circles or circumfer|ences be equal, then it will be as their area, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ply.</P>
<P>On these principles I have calculated the fol|lowing table, shewing the power required <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quantity ground both by theory, and what I sup|pose to be the nearest practice.</P>

Having now laid down in art.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 63.</NOTE> 61, 62, and 63, a theory for measuring the power of any mill-seat, and for ascertaining the quantity of that power that mill-stones of different diameters will require, by which we can find the diameter of the stones to suit the power of the seat: and, having fixed on six cubochs of that power per second to every superficial foot of the mill-stone, as requisite to move the mean circle of the stone 18 feet per second, when in the act of grinding with moderate and sufficient feed, and having al|lowed the passing of 34804 feet per minute to grind 5lb. in the same time, which is the effect of the five feet stone in the table, by which, if right, we can calculate the quantity that a stone of any size will grind with any velocity.</P>
<P>I have chosen a velocity of 18 feet per second, for the mean circle of all stones, which is slower than common practice, but not too slow for making good flour. See art. 111.

This great column of water in motion, in this case, would strike with a force equal to a solid body of equal weight and velocity, the shock of which would be suffi|cient to burst any trunk that ever was made of wood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">If they are too small they are worse than none.</NOTE> Many having thought the use of these pipes to be to let out the air, have made then too small, so that they would vent the air fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> enough to let the water in with considerable ve|locity, but would not vent the water fast enough when full, to cheek its motion easily, in which case they are worse than none at all, for if the

<P>Whenever the air has been compressed in the trunk by the water coming in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Air prevents trunks from bursting.</NOTE> it has made a great blowing noise in escaping through the crevices, and therefore has been blamed as the cause of the bursting of the trunk; whereas it acted by its elastic principle as a great preventative against it. For I do suppose, that if we were to pump the air all out of a trunk, 100 feet long, and 3 by 3 feet wide, and let the water in with full force, that it would burst, if as thick as a cannon of cast me|tal: because in that case there would be 900 cu|bic feet of water, equal to 56250lbs. pressed on by the weight of the atmosphere, with a velocity of 47 feet per second, to be suddenly stopped, the shock would be inconceivable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To prevent ice from gathering on overshot wheels when standing, the water is shut out of the trunk by a gate at the canal, and what leaks thro' it is let thro' a hole in the bottom of the trunk: the water is let in again with full force.</NOTE></P>

<P>The apparatus being now explained I think necessary to assign the sense in which I use <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> term Power.</P>
<P>The word power is used in practical mecha|nics I apprehend to signify the exertion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> strength, gravity, impulse, or pressure, so a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> produce motion.</P>

But note all this is to be understood in case of slow or equable motion of the body raised, for in quick, accelerated, or retarded motions, the visinertia of the matter moved will make a variation.</P>
<P>In comparing the effects produced by water-wheels with the powers producing them; or in other words to know what part of the original power is necessarily lost in the application, we must previously know how much of the power is

spent in overcoming the friction of the machinery and the resistance of the air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 67.</NOTE> also what is the real velocity of the water at the instant it strikes the wheel, and the real quantity of water expended in a given time.</P>
<P>From the velocity of the water at the instant that it strikes the wheel, given; the height of the head productive of such velocity can be de|duced, from acknowledged and experienced prin|ciples of hydrostatics: so that by multiplying the quantity or weight of water really expended in a given time, by the height of head so obtained; which must be considered as the height from which that weight of water had descended, in that given time; we shall have a product equal to the origin|al power of the water, and clear of all uncertain|ty that would arise from the friction of the water in passing small apertures, and from all doubts, arising from the different measure of spouting wa|ters, assigned by different authors.</P>
<P>On the other hand the sum of the weights rais|ed by the action of this water, and of the weight required to overcome the friction and resistance of the machine; multiplied by the height to which the weight can be raised in the time given, the product will be the effect of that power; and the proportion of the two products will be the pro|portion of the power to the effect: so that by loading the wheel with different weights succes|sively, we shall be able to determine at what par|ticular load and velocity of the wheel the effect is a maximum.</P>
<DIV6 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>To determine the Velocity of the Water striking the Wheel.</HEAD>
<P>First let the wheel be put in motion by the water, but without any weight in the scale; and let the number of turns in a minute be 60: now

it is evident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 67.</NOTE> that was the wheel free from fric|tion and resistance, that 60 times the circumfer|ence of the wheel would be the space through which the water would have passed in a minute; with that velocity wherewith it struck the wheel: But the wheel being incumbered with friction and resistance and yet moving 60 turns in a minute, it is plain that the velocity of the wa|ter must have been greater than 60 circumferen|ces, before it met with the wheel. Let the cord now be wound round the cylinder but contrary to the usual way, and put as much weight in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> scale as will without any water turn the wheel somewhat faster than 60 turns in a minute, sup|pose 63, and call this the counter-weight, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> let it be tried again with the water assisted by this counter-weight, the wheel therefore will now make more than 60 turns in a minute, sup|pose 64, hence we conclude the water still exerts some power to turn the wheel.

<P>In like manner in seeking the greatest product or maximum of effect; having found by trials what weight gives the greatest product, by simply mul|tiplying the weight in the scale, by the number of turns of the wheel, find what weight in the

Then it would have agreed with the theory established art 41. This perhaps es|caped the notice of our author.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="028644_0145_0FDA2B442BC41230">
It is somewhat remarkable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 67.</NOTE> that though the ve|locity of the wheel in relation to the water turns out greater than 1-3 of the velocity of the water, yet the impulse of the water in case of the maxi|mum is more than double of what is assigned by theory; that is, instead of 4/9 of the column it is nearly equal to the whole column.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This observation of the author I think a strong confirmation of the truths of the theory established art. 41; where the maximum velocity is made to be, 577 parts of the velocity of the water, and the load to be 2-3 the greatest load: For if the gate had been drawn near the floats, the greatest load would probably have been 14lb. 1 oz. or as 3 to 2, of the maximum load.</NOTE></P>
<P>It must be remembered, therefore, that in the present case, the wheel was not placed in an open river where the natural current after it has com|municated its impulse to the float, has room on all sides to escape, as the theory supposes; but in a conduit or race, to which the float being adapted, the water cannot otherwise escape than by mov|ing along with the wheel. It is observable, that a wheel working in this manner as soon as the wa|ter meets the float, it receiving a sudden check rises up against the float, like a wave against a fix|ed object, insomuch, that when the sheet of wa|ter is not a quarter of an inch thick, before it meets the float, yet this sheet will act upon the whole surface of a float, whose height is three inches; consequently, was the float no higher than the thickness of the sheet of water, as the theory al|so supposes, a great part of the force would be lost by the water dashing over the float.</P>
<P>In confirmation of what is already delivered, I have adjoined the following table, containing the result of 27 experiments made and reduced in the manner above specified. What remains of the theory of undershot wheels, will naturally follow from a comparison of the different expe|riments together.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>OBSERV. 1st. On comparing column 2 and 4, table I, it is evident, that the virtual head bears no certain proportion to the head of water, but that when the aperture is greater or the velocity of the water issuing therefrom less, they approach nearer to a coincidence: and consequently, in the large opening of mills and sluices, where great quantities of water are discharged from moderate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eads, the head of water and virtual head deter|mined from the velocity will nearer agree, as ex|perience confirms.</P>
<P>OBSERV. 2nd. Upon comparing the several proportions between the powers and effects in co|lumn 11th, the most general is that of 10 to 3; the streams are 10 to 3,2 and 10 to 2,8; but as it is observable, that where the quantity of water or the velocity thereof is great, that is, where the power is greatest, the 2nd term of the ratio is greatest also, we may therefore well allow the proportion subsisting in large works as 3 to 1.</P>
<P>OBSERV. 3rd. The proportion of velocities between the water and wheel in column 12 are contained in the limits of 3 to 1 and 2 to 1; but as the greater velocities approach the limits of 3 to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and the greater quantity of water approach to

<P>OBSERV. 4th. On comparing the numbers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> column 13, it appears, that there is no certain ra|tio between the load that the wheel will ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its maximum, and what will totally stop it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that they are contained within the limits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 19 and of 20 to 15; but as the effect approach nearest to the ratio of 20 to 15 or of 4 to 3, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the power is greatest, whether by increase of ve|locity or quantity of water, this seems to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> most applicable to large works: but as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that a wheel ought to have in order to work the best advantage, can be assigned by knowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> effect it ought to produce, and the velocity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ought to have in producing it, the exact know|ledge of the greatest load that it will bear is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> less consequence in practice.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the author is here again deceived by the imperfection of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> model; for had the water been drawn close to the float, the load that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> totally stop the wheel would always be equal to the column of water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the wheel.

<P>It is to be noted, that in almost all of the exam|ples under the three last maxims (of the four pre|ceding) the effect of the lesser power falls short <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its due proportion to the greater, when comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> by its maxim.

<P>After the experiments abovementioned were tried, the wheel which had 24 floats was reduc|ed to 12, which caused a diminution in the effect on account of a greater quantity of water escap|ing between the floats and the floor, but a cricu|lar sweep being adapted thereto, of such a length that one float entered the curve before the pre|ceding one quitted it, the effect came so near to the former, as not to give hopes of increasing the effect by increasing the number of floats past 24, in this particular wheel.</P>

<P>In these experiments the head being 6 inches, and the height of the wheel 24 inches, the whole descent will be 30 inches: the expence of water was 14&frac12; strokes of the pump in a minute, where of 12 contained 80lb. therefore the water ex|pended in a minute, was 96&frac23;lb. which multiplied by 30 inches, gives the power =2900.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS AND DEDUCTION FROM THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS.</HEAD>
<DIV6 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I. Concerning the Ratio between the Power and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Overshot Wheels.</HEAD>
<P>The effective power of the water must be rec|koned upon the whole descent, because it must be raised to that height in order to be in a condition of producing the same effect a second time.</P>
<P>The ratios between the powers so estimated and the effects at the maximum, deduced from the several sets of experiments are exhibited at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> view in column 9 of table III; and hence it ap|pears, that those ratios differs from that of 10 to 7,6 to that of 10 to 5,2; that is, nearly from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 3 to 4:2. In those experiments where the head of water and quantities expended are least; the proportion is nearly as 4 to 3, but where the head and quantities are greatest, it approaches nearer to that of 4 to 2, and by a medium of the whole the ratio is that of 3:2 nearly. We have seen be|fore in our observations upon the effects of under|shot wheels, that the general ratio of the power to the effect when greatest, was as 3:1. The ef|fect, therefore of overshot wheels, under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> circumstances of quantity and fall, is at a medi|um double to that of the undershot: and a con|sequence thereof, that non-elastic bodies when acting by their impulse or collision, communication only a part of their original power; the other part being spent in changing their figure, in con|sequence of the stroke.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These observations of the author agree with the theory art. 41&mdash;42. In add that non-elastic bodies, when acting by impulse or collision <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">cate only half of their original power, by the laws of motion.</NOTE></P>
<P>The powers of water computed from the height of the wheel only, compared with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="151" REF="028644_0159_0FDA2B60CC388E28">
as in column 10,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 68.</NOTE> appear to observe a more constant ratio: for if we take the medium of each class, which is set down in column 11. we shall find the extreme to differ no more than from the ratio of 10:8,1 to that of 10:8,5, and as the se|cond terms of the ratio gradually increases from 8,1 to 8,5 by an increase of head from 3 inches to 11, the excess of 8,5 above 8,1 is to be imputed to the superior impulse of the water, at the head of 11 inches, above that of 3 inches, so that if we reduce 8,1 to 8, on account of the impulse of the 3 inch head, we shall have the ratio of the power computed upon the height of the wheel only, to the effect at a maximum, as 10:8 or as 5:4 nearly. And from the equality of the ratio, between pow|er and effect, subsisting where the constructions are similar, we must infer that the effects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well as the powers, are as the quantities of water and perpendicular heights, multiplied together re|spectively.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="2" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>II. Concerning the most proper Height of the Wheel in Proportion to the whole descent.</HEAD>
<P>We have already seen in the preceding observ|ation, that the effect of the same quantity of wa|ter, descending through the same perpendicular space, is double, when acting by its gravity upon an overshot wheel, to what the same produces when acting by its impulse, upon an undershot. It also appears that by increasing the head from 3 to 11 inches, that is, the whole descent, from 27 to 35, or in the ratio of 7 to 9 nearly, the ef|fect is advanced no more than in the ratio of 8,1 to 8,4; that is, as 7:7,26, and consequently the increase of the effect is not 1/7 of the increase of the perpendicular height. Hence it follows that the higher the wheel is in proportion to the whole descent, the greater will be the effect; because it depends less upon the impulse of the head, and
<PB N="152" REF="028644_0160_0FDA2B64C4BA4FD8">
more upon the gravity of the water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 68.</NOTE> in the buck|ets: and if we consider how obliquely the water issuing from the head must strike the buckets, we shall not be at a loss to account for the little ad|vantage that arises from the impulse thereof; and shall immediately see of how little conse|quence his impulse is to the effect of an overshot wheel. However, as every thing has its limits, so has this: for thus much is desirable, that the water should have somewhat greater velocity, than the circumference of the wheel, in coming thereon: otherwise the wheel will not only be re|tarded by the buckets striking the water, but thereby dashing a part of it over, so much of the power is lost.</P>
<P>The velocity that the circumference of the wheel ought to have being known, the head re|quisite to give the water its proper velocity is ea|sily found, by the common rules of Hydrostatics and will be found much less than what is comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n|ly practised.</P>
</DIV6>
<DIV6 N="3" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>III. Concerning the Velocity of the Circumferences of the Wheel in order to produce the greatest Ef|fect.</HEAD>
<P>If a body is let fall freely from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urface of the head to the bottom of the descent, it will take a certain time in falling; and in this case the whole action of gravity is spent in giving the body a cer|tain velocity: But, if this body in falling is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to act upon some other body, so as to produce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mechanical effect, the falling body will be retard|ed; because, a part of the action of gravity is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> spent in producing the effect, and the remainder only giving motion to the falling body: and there|fore, the slower a body descends, the greater will be the portion of the action of gravity applicable to the producing a mechanical effect. Hence we
<PB N="153" REF="028644_0161_0FDA2B6708BC2138">
are led to this general rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 68.</NOTE> that the less the velo|city of the wheel, the greater will be the effect thereof. A confirmation of this doctrine, toge|ther with the limits it is subject to in practice, may be deduced from the foregoing specimen of a set of experiments.</P>
<P>From these experiments it appears, that when the wheel made about 20 turns in a minute, the effect was near upon the greatest; when it made 30 turns, the effect was diminished about 1/20; part; but, that when it made 40, it was diminished a|bout &frac14; when it made less than 18&frac14;, its motion was irregular; and when it was loaded so as not to admit its making 18 turns, the wheel was over|powered by its load.</P>
<P>It is an advantage in practice, that the velocity of the wheel should not be diminished farther than what will procure some solid advantage in point of power; because, as the motion is slower, the buckets must be made larger; and the wheel be|ing more loaded with water, the stress upon every part of the work will be increased in proportion: the best velocity for practice therefore will be such, as when the wheel here used made about 30 turns in a minute; that is, when the velocity of the circumference is a little more than 3 feet in a second.</P>
<P>Experience confirms, that this velocity of 3 feet in a second, is applicable to the highest overshot wheels as well as the lowest; and all other parts of the work being properly adapted thereto, will produce very nearly the greatest effect possible. However, this also is certain, from experience, that high wheels may deviate further from this rule, before they will loose their power, by a gi|ven aliquot part of the whole, than low ones can be admitted to do: for a wheel of 24 feet high may move at the rate of 6 feet per second without loos|ing

any considerable part of its power: and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 68.</NOTE> on the other hand, I have seen a wheel of 33 feet high that has moved very steadily and well, with a ve|locity but little exceeding 2 feet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Probably this wheel was working forge of furnace bellows, which have deceived many by their slow regular motion.</NOTE></P>
<P>[Said Smeaton has also made a model of a wind-mill, and a complete set of experiments on the power and effect of the wind, acting on wind-mill sails of different constructions. But as the ac|counts thereof are quite too long for the compass of my work, I therefore only extract little more than a few of the principal maxims deduced from his experiments, which, I think, may not only be of good service, to those who are concerned in building wind-mills, but may serve to confirm some principles, deduced from his experiments on water-mills.]</P>

<P>IN trying experiments on wind-mill sails, the wind itself is too uncertain to answer the pur|pose: we must therefore have recourse to artifi|cial wind.</P>
<P>This may be done two ways; either by caus|ing the air to move against the machine, or the machine to move against the air. To cause the air to move against the machine in a sufficient co|lumn with steadiness and the requisite velocity, is not easily put in practice: To carry the ma|chine forward in a right line against the air,

and that the ratio of the greatest load to that of a maximum is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 69.</NOTE> as 9 to 7,5, but by adding the weight of the scale and friction to the load the ratio turns out to be as 10:8,4, or as 5 to 4 nearly. The following table is the result of 19 similar sets of experiments.</P>
<P>By the following table it appears, that the most general ratio between the velocity of the sails un|loaded and when loaded to a maximum, is 3 to 2 nearly.</P>
<P>And the ratio between the greatest load and the load at a maximum (taking such experiments where the sails answered best) is at a medium a|bout as 6 to 5 nearly.</P>
<P>And that the kind of sails used in the 15th and 16th experiments is best of all, because they pro|duce the greatest effect or product, in proportion to their quantity of surface, as appears in column 12.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the Effects of Sails according to the differ|ent Velocity of the Wind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 69.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>From the foregoing table the following maxims deduced.</P>
<P>MAXIM I. The velocity of wind-mill sails, whe|ther unloaded or loaded, so as to produce a maxi|mum, is nearly as the velocity of the wind, their shape and position being the same.</P>
<P>This appears by comparing the respective num|bers of columns 4 and 5, table V, wherein those numbers 2,4 and 6, ought to be double of No. 1,3 and 5, and are as nearly so as can be expected by the experiments.</P>
<P>MAXIM II. The load at the maximum is near|ly but somewhat less than as the square of the ve|locity of the wind, the shape and position of the sails being the same.</P>
<P>This appears by comparing No. 2,4 and 6, in column 6, with 1, 3 and 5, wherein the former ought to be quadruple of the latter (as the veloci|ty is double) and are as nearly so as can be expect|ed.</P>
<P>MAXIM III. The effects of the same sails at a maximum are nearly, but somewhat less than, as the cubes of the velocity of the wind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This confirms the 7th law of spouting fluids.</NOTE></P>
<P>It has been shewn maxim I, that the velocity of sails at a maximum, is nearly as the velocity of the wind; and by maxim II, that the load at the maximum is nearly as the square of the same ve|locity. If those two maxims would hold precise|ly, it would be a consequence that the effect would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in triplicate ratio thereof. How this agrees with experiment will appear by comparing the products in column 8, wherein those of No. 2, 4 and 6 (the velocity of the wind being double) ought to be octuble of those of No. 1, 3 and 5, and are nearly so.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="028644_0168_0FDA2B84E5A69490">
MAXIM IV. The load of the same sails at the maximum is nearly as the squares of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 69.</NOTE> and their ef|fects as the cubes, of their number of turns in a given time.</P>
<P>This maxim may be esteemed a consequence of the three preceding ones.</P>
<P>[These 4 maxims agree with and confirm the 4 maxims concerning the effects of spouting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> acting on undershot mills; and, I think, sufficient|ly confirms as a law of motion, that the effect pro|duced if not the instant momentum of a body in motion, is as the square of its velocity, as asserted by the Dutch and Italian philosophers.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT has been said in the first part, was meant to establish theories and easy rules&mdash;In this part I mean to bring them into practice, in as concise a manner as possible, referring only to the articles in the first part, where the reasons and demonstrations are given.</P>
<P>This part is particularly intended for the help of Young and Practical Millwrights, whose time will not permit them fully to investigate the principles of theo|ries, which requires a longer series of studies than most of them can possibly spare from their business; there|fore I shall endeavour here to reduce the substance of all that has been said, to a few tables, rules, and short directions, which, if found to agree with practice, will be sufficient for the practitioner.</P>
<P>There are but two principles by which water acts on mill-wheels, to give them motion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Percussion and Gravity.</P>
<P>That equal quantities of water, under equal per|pendicular descents, will produce double the power by
<PB N="ii" REF="028644_0170_0FDA2B87C289F2B8">
gravity that it will by percussion, has been shewn in articles 8 and 68.</P>
<P>Therefore, when the water is scarce, we ought to endeavour to cause it to act by gravity, as much as possible, paying due regard to other circumstances noted in article 44, so as to obtain a steady motion, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>THE YOUNG Mill-wright's Guide. CHAPTER I. OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MILLS.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="70" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Of Undershot Mills.</HEAD>
<P>UNDERSHOT wheels move by the per|cussion or stroke of the water, and are only half as powerful as other wheels that are moved by the gravity of the water. See art. 8. Therefore this construction ought not to be used, except where there is but little fall or great plenty of water. The undershot wheel, and all others that move by percussion, should move with a velocity nearly equal to two thirds of the velocity of the water. See art. 42. Fig. 28. plate iv. represents this con|struction.</P>
<P>For a rule for finding the velocity of the water, under any given head, see art. 51.</P>
<P>Upon which principles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Principles on which is founded the undershot table.</NOTE> and by said rule, is formed the following table of the velocity of spouting water, under different heads, from one to twenty-five feet high above the centre of the issue; to which is added the velocity of
<PB N="4" REF="028644_0172_0FDA2B8AC0B9C698">
the wheel suitable thereto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Principles on which is founded the undershot table.</NOTE> and the number of revolutions a wheel of fifteen feet diameter (which I take to be a good size) will revolve in a minute; also, the number of cogs and rounds in the wheels, both for double and sin|gle gears, so as to produce about ninety-seven or one hundred revolutions for a five feet stone per minute, which I take to be a good mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> and size for a mill-stone, grinding for mer|chantable flour.</P>
<P>That the reader may fully understand how the following table is calculated, let him ob|serve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That by art. 42, the velocity of the wheel must be just 577 thousandth parts of the velocity of the water; therefore, if the velo|city of the water, per second, be multiplied by, 577 the product will be the maximum ve|locity of the wheel, or velocity that will pro|duce the greatest effect, which is the third co|lumn in the table.</P>
<P N="2">2. The velocity of the wheel per second, multiplied by 60, produces the distance the circumference moves per minute, which, di|vided by 47,1 feet, the circumference of a 15 feet wheel, quotes the number of revolutions of the wheel per minute, which is the fourth column.</P>
<P N="3">3. That by art. 20 and 74, the number of revolutions of the wheel per minute, multi|plied by the number of cogs in all the driving wheels, successively, and that product divided by the product of the number of cogs in all the leading wheels, multiplied successively, the quotient is the revolutions of the stones per minute, which is the ninth and twelfth co|lumns.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="5" REF="028644_0173_0FDA2B8C2BD28D38">

Note, that five feet fall is the least that a single gear can be built on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP.1.</NOTE> to keep the cog-wheel clear of the water, and give the stone sufficient motion.</P>
<P>Although double gear is calculated to fifteen feet fall, yet I do not recommend them above ten feet, unless for some particular conveni|ence, such as two pair of stones to one wheel, &amp;c. &amp;c. The number of cogs in the wheels are even, and chosen to suit eight, fix, or four arms, so as not to pass through any of them, this being the common practice. But when the motion cannot be obtained without a trun|dle that will cause the same cogs and rounds to meet too often, such as 16 into 96, which will meet every revolution of the cog-wheel, or 18 into 96, which will meet every third re|volution&mdash;I advise rather to put in one more or less, as may best suit the motion, which will cause them to change oftener. See art. 82.</P>
<P>Note, that the friction at the aperture of the gate will greatly diminish both the veloci|ty and power of the water in this application, where the head is great, if the gate be made of the usual form, wide and shallow. Where the head is great, the friction will be great. See art. 55. Therefore the wheel must be narrow, and the aperture of the gate of a square form, to evade the friction and loss that may be under a wide wheel, if it does not run close to the sheeting.</P>

<HEAD>Use of the Table.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING levelled your mill-seat carefully, and finding such fall and quantity of water as determines you to make choice of an under|shot wheel; for instance, suppose 6 feet fall, and about 45 cubic feet of water per second, which you find as directed in art. 53; cast of about 1 foot for fall in the tale-race, below the bottom of the wheel, if subject to back|water, leaves you 5 feet head; look for 5 feet head in the first column of the table, and a|gainst it are all the calculations for a 15 feet water-wheel and 5 feet stones; in the thir|teenth column you have 44,7 cubic feet of water; which shews you have enough for a 5 feet pair of stones; and the velocity of the water will be 18 feet per second, the velocity of the wheel 10,38 feet per second, and it will revolve 13,22 times per minute. And if you choose double gear, then 66 cogs in the master cog-wheel, 24 rounds in the wallower, 48 cogs in the counter cog-wheel, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rounds in the trundle, will give the stone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> revolutions in a minute; if single gear, 112 cogs and 15 rounds give 98,66 revolutions in a minute; it will require 44,7 cubic feet of water per second; the size of the gate must be 2,48 feet, which will be about 4 feet wide and, 62 feet deep, about 7 1-4 inches deep; the size of the canal must be 29,8 feet; that is, about 3 feet deep, and 9,93 or nearly 10 feet wide. If you choose single gear, you may make your water-wheel much less, say

7 1-2 feet, the half of 15 feet, then the cog-wheel must have half the number of cogs, the trundle-head the same, the spindle will be longer, husk lower, and the mill full as good; but, in this case, it will not do, because a cog-wheel of 66 cogs would reach the water; but where the head is 10 or 12 feet, it will do very well.</P>
<P>If you choose stones, or water-wheels, of other sizes, it will be easy, by the rules by which the table is calculated, to proportion the whole to suit, seeing you have the veloci|ty of the periphery of a wheel of any size.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>One advantage large wheels has over small ones is, they cast off the back-water much better. The buckets of the low wheel will lift the water much more than those of the high wheel; because, the nearer the water rises to the centre of the wheel, the nearer the buckets approach the horizontal or lifting position.</P><P>Fig. 28 is an undershot wheel. Some prefer to slant the forebay under the wheel, as in the figure, that the gate may be drawn near the floats; because (say they) the water acts with more power near the gate, than at a distance; which appears to be the case, when we consider, that the nearer we approach the gate, the nearer the column of water ap|proaches to be what is called a perfect definite quantity. See art. 59.</P><P>Others again say, that it acquires equal power in descend|ing the shute (it will certainly acquire equal velocity, abating only for the friction of the shute and air). When the shute has a considerable descent, the greater the distance from the gate, the greater the velocity and power of the water; but where the descent of the shute is not sufficient to overcome the friction of the air, &amp;c. then the nearer the gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Best to car|ry the water down a long shute to the wheel, in high heads.</NOTE> the greater the velocity and power of the water; which argues in favour of drawing the gate near the floats. Yet, where the fall is great, or water plenty, and the expence of a deep penstock considerable, the small difference of power is not worth the expence of obtaining. In these cases, it is best to have a shallow penstock, and a long shute to convey the water down to the wheel, drawing the gate at the top of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which is frequently done, to save expence, in building <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mills, with flutter-wheels, which are small undershot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fixed on the crank, so small as to obtain a sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of strokes of the saw in a minute, say about 120. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wheel is to be calculated of such size as to suit the velocity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the water at the point of impact, so as to make that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of revolutions in a minute.</P>

See fig. 29, plate IV, which is a top view of the tub-wheel, and fig. 30 is a side view of it, with the stone on the top of the shaft, bridge-tree, &amp;c. The wheel runs in a hoop, like a mill-stone hoop, projecting so far above the wheel as to prevent the water from shooting over the wheel, and whirls it about until it strikes the buckets, because the water is shot on in a deep narrow column, 9 inches wide and 18 inches deep, to drive a 5 feet stone, with 8 feet head&mdash;so that all this column can|not enter the buckets until part has passed half way round the wheel, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> there are always nearly half the buckets struck at once; the buckets are set obliquely, so that the water

may strike them at right angles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP.1.</NOTE> See fig. 30. As soon as it strikes it escapes under the wheel in every direction, as in fig. 29.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Note, that in fig. 30, I have allowed the gate to be drawn inside of the penstock, and not in the shute near the wheel, as is the common practice; because the water will leak out much along side of the gate, if drawn in the shute. But here we must consider, that the gate must always be full drawn, and the quantity of water regulated by a regulate in the shute near the wheel; so that the shute will be per|fectly full, and pressed with the whole weight of the head, else a great part of the power may be lost.</P><P>To shew this more plain, suppose the long shute A, from the high head (shewn by dotted lines) of the undershot mill, fig. 28, be made tight by being covered at top, then, if we draw the gate A, but not fully, if the shute at bottom be large enough to vent all the water that issues through the gate, when the shute is full to A, then it cannot fill higher than A; therefore, all that part of the head above A is lost, it being of no other service than to supply the shute, and keep it full to A, and the head from A to the wheel is all that acts on the wheel.</P><P>Again, when we shut the gate, the shute cannot run emp|ty, because it would leave a vacuum in the head of the shute at A; therefore the pressure of the atmosphere resists the water from running out of the shute, and whatever head of water is in the shute, when the gate is shut, will balance its weight of the pressure of the atmosphere, and prevent it from acting on the lower side of the gate, which will cause it to be very hard to draw&mdash;For, suppose 11 feet head of water to be in the shute when the gate was shut, its pressure is equal to about 5lb. per square inch; then, if the gate be 48 by 6 inches, which is equal to 288 inches, this multiplies by 5, is equal to 1440 lb. the additional pressure on the gate.</P>

<P>Again, if the gate be full drawn, and the shute be not much larger at the upper than lower end, all these evils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> take place to cause the loss of power. To remedy all this, put the gate H at the bottom of the shute to regulate the quantity of water by, and make a valve at A to shut on the inside of the shute, like the valve of a pair of bellows, which will shut when the gate A is drawn, and open when the gate shuts, to let air into the shute; this plan will do better tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> long open shutes, for saw-mills with flutter-wheels or tub mills, as by it we evade the friction of the shute and resistance of the air.</P><P>The reader will with difficulty understand what is here said, unless he be acquainted with the theory of the pressure of the atmosphere, vacuums, &amp;c.

The disadvantages of these wheels are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP.1.</NOTE></P>
<P N="1">1. The water does not act to advantage on them, we being obliged to make them so small to obtain velocity to the stone (in most cases) that the buckets take up a third part of their diameter.</P>
<P N="2">2. The water acts with less power than on undershot wheels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tub mills act with less power than undershots.</NOTE> as it is less confined at the time of striking the wheel, and its non elastic principle takes place more fully. See art. 8.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is with difficulty we can put a sufficient quantity of water to act on them to drive them with sufficient power, if the head be low; therefore I advise to strike the water on in two places, as in fig. 29; then the apertures need only be about 6 by 13 inches each, in|stead of 9 by 18, and will act to more advan|tage; and then, in this case, nearly all the buckets will be acted on at once.</P>
<P>Their advantages are,</P>
<P>Their exceeding simplicity and cheapness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are preferable to others, with plenty of water.</NOTE> having no cogs nor rounds to be kept in re|pair; their wearing parts are few, and have but little friction; the step-gudgeon runs un|der water, therefore, if well fixed, will not get out of order in a long time; and they will move with sufficient velocity and power with 9 or 10 feet total fall, and plenty of water; and, if they be well fixed, they will not re|quire

much more water than undershot wheels; therefore they are vastly preferable in all seats with plenty of water, and above 8 feet fall.</P>
<P>In order that the reader may fully under|stand how the following table is calculated, let him consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That as the tub-wheel moves altogether by percussion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Should move 2-3 the velocity of the water</NOTE> the water flying clear of the wheel the instant it strikes, and it being better, by art. 70, for such wheels to move faster in|stead of slower than the maximum velocity; therefore, instead of ,577 we will allow them to move ,66 velocity of the water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules To find the velocity of the water.</NOTE> then mul|tiplying the velocity of the water by ,66 gives the velocity of the wheel, at the centre of the buckets; which is the 3d column in the table.</P>
<P N="2">2. And the velocity of the wheel per second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its diameter</NOTE> multiplied by 60, and divided by the number of revolutions the stone is to make in a minute, gives the circumference of the wheel at the centre of the buckets; which circumference, multiplied by 7, and divided by 22, gives the diameter from the centre of the buckets, to produce the number of revolutions required; which are the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th columns.</P>
<P N="3">3. The cubochs of power required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The quanti|ty of water required.</NOTE> by art. 63, to drive the stone, divided by half the head, gives the cubic feet of water required to produce said power; which are the 8th and 10th columns.</P>

<P>This structure of a wheel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 31,</NOTE> fig. 31, I take to be a good one, for the following reasons, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. The buckets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wheel of new con|struction.</NOTE> or floats, receive the per|cussion of the water at right angles, which is the best direction possible.</P>
<P N="2">2. It prevents the water from flying to|wards the centre of the wheel, without re|acting against the bottom of the buckets, and retains it in the wheel, to act by its gravity in its descent, after the stroke.</P>
<P N="3">3. It admits air, and discharges the water freely, without lifting it at bottom; and this is an important advantage, because, if the buckets of a wheel be tight, and the wheel wades a little in back-water, they will lift the water a considerable distance as they empty; the pressure of the atmosphere prevents the water from leaving the buckets freely, and it requires a great force to lift them out of the water with the velocity of wheel; which may be proved by dipping a common water-bucket into water, and lifting it out, bot|tom up, with a quick motion, you have to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ft not only the water in the bucket, but it appears to suck a deal more up after it; which is the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere, see art. 56. This shews the necessity of air-holes to let air into the buckets, that the wa|ter may have liberty to get out freely.</P>
<P>Its disadvantages are,</P>
<P N="1">1. It loses the water much, if it is not kept close to the sheeting. And,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="20" REF="028644_0188_0FDA2BC47842C178">
2. It requires too great a part of the total fall to be used as head, which is a loss of pow|er, one foot fall being equal in power to two feet head, by art. 8.</P>
<P>Fig. 32 is a draught,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 32.</NOTE> shewing the position of the shute for striking the water on a wheel in a tangent direction, for all the total perpen|dicular descents from 6 to 15 feet; the points of impact are numbered inside the fig. with the number of the total fall, that each is for respectively. The top of the shute is only about 15 inches from the wheel, in order to set the point of impact as high as possible, al|lowing 3 feet above the upper end of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the top of the water in the penstock, which is little enough, when the head is often to be run down any considerable distance; but when the stream is steady, being always nearly the same height in the penstock, 2 feet would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sufficient, especially in the greatest total <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> where the quantity is less, raising the shute foot would raise the point of impact nearly the same, and increase the power, because I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fall is equal in power to 2 feet head, by art 61.</P>
<P>On these principles, to suit the application of water, as represented by fig. 32, I have calculated the following table for breast mill. And, in order that the reader may fully un|derstand the principles on which it is calcu|lated, let him consider as follows:</P>

<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="028644_0189_0FDA2BC61DB09218">
2. That half the head, added to the whole fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I.</NOTE> constitutes the virtual or effective descent, by art. 61; which is the 4th column.</P>

Therefore, to find the velocity of this wheel, I first multiply the ve|locity of the head, in column 5, by ,577 (as for the undershot mills) which gives the velo|city suitable to the head; I then (by the rule for determining the velocity of overshots) say, as the velocity of water descending 21 feet, equal to 37,11 feet per second, is to the velo|city of the wheel 10 feet per second, so is the acceleration of velocity, after it passes the point of impact, to the accelerated velocity of the wheel; and these two velocities added, gives the velocity of the wheel; which is the 6th column.</P>

<HEAD>Use of the Table for Breast Mills.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING a seat with above 6 feet fall but not enough for an overshot mill, and the water being scarce, so that you wish to make the best use of it, leads you to the choice of a breast mill.</P>
<P>Cast off about 1 foot for fall in the tale-race below the bottom of the wheel, if much subject to back-water; and suppose you have then 9 feet total descent; look for it in the first column of the table, and against it you have it divided into 5,9 feet head above, and 3,1 feet fall below the point of impact, which is the highest point that the water can be fair|ly struck on the wheel, leaving the head 3 feet deep above the shute; which is equal to 6,05 feet virtual or effective descent: the velocity of the water striking the wheel 18,99 feet, velocity of the wheel 12,07 feet, per second, will revolve 16 times in a minute; and, if single geared, 104 cogs, and 16 rounds, gives the stone 99,4 revolutions in a minute, re|quires 21,29 cubic feet of water per second; the area of a section of the canal must be 14,19 feet, about 3 feet deep, and 5 feet wide. If the stones be of any other size, it is easy to proportion the gears to give them any number of revolutions required.</P>
<P>If you wish to proportion the size of the stones to the power of your seat, multiply the cubic feet of water your stream affords per se|cond, by the virtual descent in column 4, and that product is the power in cubochs; then
<PB N="25" REF="028644_0193_0FDA2BD858F290F0">
look in the table, in art. 63, for the size of the stone that nearest suits that power.</P>
<P>For instance, suppose your stream affords 14 cubic feet of water per second, then 14 multi|plied by 6,05 feet virtual descent, produces 84,7 cubochs of power; which, in the table in art. 63, comes nearest to 4,5 feet for the dia|meter of the stones; but, by the rules laid down in art. 63, the size may be found more exactly.</P>
<P>Note, 6 cubochs of power are required to every superficial foot of the stones.</P>

<HEAD>Art. 73. Of Overshot Mills.</HEAD>
<P>FIG. 33,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 33. Overshot Wheel de|scribed.</NOTE> plate IV, is an Overshot Wheel; the water is laid on at the top, so that the up|per part of the column will be in a true tan|gent direction with the circumference of the wheel, but so that all the water may strike with|in the circle of the wheel.</P>
<P>The gate is drawn about 12 inches behind the perpendicular line from the centre of the wheel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of shooting on the water</NOTE> and the point of the shute ends at said perpendicular, with a direction a little down|wards, which gives the water a little velocity downwards to follow the wheel; for if it be directed horizontally, the head will give it no velocity downwards, and, if the head be great, the parabolic curve, which the spouting water forms, will extend beyond the outside of the
<PB N="26" REF="028644_0194_0FDA2BE4F68FA2D8">
circle of the wheel, and it will incline to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over. See art. 44 and 60.</P>
<P>The head above the wheel acts by per|cussion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proper ve|locity of the water spouting on the wheel.</NOTE> as on an undershot wheel, and we have shewn, art. 43, that the head should be such as to give the water velocity 3 for 2 of the wheel. After the water strikes the wheel it acts by gravity; therefore, to calculate the power, we must take half the head and add it to the fall, for the virtual descent, as in breast mills.</P>
<P>The velocity of overshot wheels are as the square roots of their diameters. See art. 43.</P>
<P>On these principles, I have calculated the following table for overshot wheels; and, in order that the reader may understand it fully, let him consider well the following premises:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the velocity of the water spouting on the wheel must be one and a half the velo|city of the wheel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rule for proportion|ing the head to the wheel</NOTE> by art. 43; then, to find the head that will give said velocity, say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the square of 16,2 feet per second, is to 4 feet, the head that gives that velocity, so is the square of the velocity required, to the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that will give that velocity&mdash;But, to this head so found, we must add a little by conjecture to overcome the friction of the aperture. See art. 55.</P>
<P>In this table, I have added to the heads o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> wheels from 9 to 12 feet diameter, 1 of a foot and from 12 to 20 I have added, 1 tenth more for every foot increase of diameter, and from 20 to 30 feet I have added ,05 more to every foot diameter's increase; which gives a 30 feet wheel 1,5 feet additional head, while a 9 feet
<PB N="27" REF="028644_0195_0FDA2BE6F74C8E20">
wheel has only, 1 tenth of a foot, to overcome the friction. The reason of this great difference will appear when we consider that the friction increases as the aperture decreases, and as the velocity increases&mdash;But this much depends on the form of the gate, for if that be nearly square, there will be but little friction, but if very oblong, say 24 inches by half an inch, then it will be very great.</P>
<P>The heads, thus found, compose the 3d co|lumn.</P>
<P N="2">2. The head, added to the diameter of the wheel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules</NOTE> makes the total descent, and is co|lumn 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. The velocity of the wheel per second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For finding the number of revolu|tions of the wheel.</NOTE> taken from the table in art. 43, and multiplied by 60, and divided by the circumference of the wheel, quotes the number of revolutions of the wheel per minute, and is column 4.</P>
<P N="4">4. The number of revolutions of the wheel per minute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ditto of the stone.</NOTE> multiplied by the number of cogs in all the driving wheels successively, and that product divided by the product of all the lead|ing wheels, quotes the number of revolutions of the stone per minute, and is column 9, double gear, for 5 feet stones; and column 12, single gear, for 6 feet stones.</P>
<P N="5">5. The cubochs of power required to drive the stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To find the quantity of water re|quired.</NOTE> by table in art. 63, divided by the virtual or effective descent, which is half the head added to the (fall or) diameter of the wheel, quotes the cubic feet of water required per second to drive the stone, and is column 13.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="28" REF="028644_0196_0FDA2BE86B046F98">
6. The cubic feet required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rule to find the size of the canal.</NOTE> divided by the velocity you intend the water to have in the canal, quotes the area of a section of the ca|nal. The width multiplied by the depth, must always produce this area. See art. 64.</P>
<P N="7">7. The number of cogs in the wheel, mul|tiplied by the quarter inches in the pitch, pro|duces the circumference of the pitch circle which, multiplied by 7, and divided by 22, quotes the diameter in quarter inches; which, reduced to feet and parts, is column 15. The reader may here at once observe how near the cog wheel, in the single gear, will be to the water; that is, how near it is, in size, equal to the water-wheel.</P>

<HEAD>Observations on the Table.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Single gear does not suit overshot wheels, high or low.</NOTE> that single gear does not much suit this construction; because, where the water-wheels are low, their motion is so flow that the cog-wheels (if made large enough to give sufficient motion to the stone, without having the trundle too small, see art. 23) will touch the water: And again, when the water-wheels are high, above 20 feet, the cog-wheels require to be so high, in order to give motion to the stone without having the trundle too small, that they become unwieldy, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">sk too high, spindle short, &amp;c. so as to be inconvenient. Therefore, single gear seems to suit overshots only where the diameter of the water-wheel is between 12 and 18 feet; and even with them, the water-wheel will have to run rather too fast, or the trundle be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ther too small, and the stones should be 6 feet diameter at least.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have, in the preceding tables, allowed the water to pass along the canal with 1,5 feet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er second velocity; but have since concluded that 1 foot per second is nearer the proper mo|tion; that is, about 20 yards per minute; then the cubic feet required per second, will be the area of a section of the canal, as in co|lumn 14 of this table.</P>
<P N="3">3. Although I have calculated this table for the velocities of the wheels to vary as the square roots of their diameters, which makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 30 feet wheel move 11,99 feet per second, and a 12 feet wheel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o move 7,57 feet per se|cond;
<PB N="32" REF="028644_0200_0FDA2D09F5BA6118">
yet they will do to have equal velocity, and head, which is the common practice among mill-wrights. But, for the reasons I have mentioned in art. 43, I prefer giving them the velocity and head assigned in the table, in order to obtain steady motion.</P>
<P N="4">4. Many have been deceived, by observing the exceeding slow and steady motion of some very high overshot wheels working forge or furnace bellows, concluding therefrom, that they will work equally steady with a very slow as with any quicker motion, not considering perhaps, that it is the principle of the bellows that regulates the motion of the wheel, which is different from any other resistance, for it soon becomes perfectly equable: therefore the motion will be uniform, which is not the case with any kind of mills.</P>
<P N="5">5. Many are of opinion, that water is not well applied by an overshot wheel; because, say they, those buckets near above or below the centre, act on too short a lever. In en|deavouring to correct this error, I have di|vided the fall of the overshot wheel, fig. 33. plate IV, into feet, by dotted lines. Now, by art. 53 and 54, every cubic foot of water on the wheel produces an equal quantity of power in descending each foot perpendicular, called a cuboch of power; because, where the lever is shortest, there is the greatest quantity of water within the foot perpendicular; or, in other words, each cubic foot of water is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much longer time, and passes a greater dis|tance, in descending a foot perpendicular, than where it is longest; which exactly com|pensates
<PB N="33" REF="028644_0201_0FDA2BFA871DA7C0">
for the deficiency in the length of lever. And, considering that the upper and lower parts of the wheel does not run away from the gravity of the water, so much as the breast of the wheel, we must conclude, that the upper and lower feet of perpendicular de|scent (in theory) actually produce more pow|er than the middle two feet&mdash;But (in practice) the lower foot is entirely lost, by the spilling of the water out of the buckets. See this de|monstrated, art 54.</P>

<HEAD>Of Mills moved by Re-action.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now treated of the four different kinds of mills that are in general use. There are others, the invention or improvements of the late ingenious James Rumsey, which move by the re-action of the water. One of these is said to do well where there is much back-water; it being small, and of a true circular form, the back-water does not resist it much. I shall say but little of these, supposing the pro|prietors mean to treat of them; but may say, that there appears to me but two principles by which water can be applied to move mill-wheels, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Percussion and Gravity.</P>
<P>For the different effects of equal quantities of water, with equal perpendicular descents, applied by these different principles, fee art.8 and 68.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="028644_0202_0FDA2BFA8B21E638">
Water may be applied, by percussion two ways, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by action (which is when it strikes the floats of a wheel) and by re-action, which is when it issues from within the wheel, and, by its re-action, moves it round; and these two are equal, by 3d general law of motion, art. 7.</P>
<P>For the effects of centrifugal force, and the inertia of the water, on this application of re-ac|tion, see axioms I and II, art. 1; and art. 13. The principle of inertia will operate in pro|portion to the quantity of water used; there|fore this application will suit high heads better than low ones.</P>
<P>Water may be applied, by gravity, two ways, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> either by spouting it high on the wheel, into tight buckets, as on common over-shots, or by causing the whole head of water to press on the floats, at the lower side of the wheel, which is so constructed that the wa|ter cannot escape, but as the wheel moves, and at the same time keeping clear of the paradoxical principle mentioned in arts.48 and 59; which cannot be done, unless the floats are made to move on pivots, so as to fold in on one side of the wheel, and open out, to re|ceive the weight of the water, on the other. And these two applications are equal in theory, as will appear plain by art. 54, fig. 20; yet they may differ greatly in practice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the year 1786, I invented and made a model of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wheel of this structure, intending thereby to apply steam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> propel land-carriages, and exhibited a drawing thereof to the legislature of Maryland, and obtained a patent (for my im|provements in mills, and also) for applying steam to land-carriages, in that state; but could not attend to put it in prac|tice. Since which time, the late ingenious James Rumsey has applied steam to a wheel of this structure, I hear, with great success, and obtained a patent, in Europe, for the in|vention; which, probably, was original with him also, as it frequently happens, that two persons, reasoning right on a mechanical subject, think alike, and invent the same thing, without any communication with each other. He has also applied this wheel to water-mills, which I did not intend to do. This may properly be called the Valve Wheel.</NOTE></P>

<P>MATHEMATICIANS have laid down the following proportions for finding the circum|ference of a circle by its diameter, or the di|ameter by the circumference given,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules</NOTE><ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>As 1 is to 3,1416, so is the diameter to the circumference;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To find the diameter &amp; circumfe|rence of cir|cles.</NOTE> and as 3,1416 is to 1, so is the circumference to the diameter: Or, as 7 is to 22, so is the diameter to the circumfe|rence; and as 22 is to 7, so is the circum|ference to the diameter. The last proportion makes the diameter a little the largest; there|fore it suits mill-wrights best for finding the pitch circle; because the sum of the distance, from centre to centre, of all the cogs in a wheel, makes the circle too short, especially where the number of cogs are few, because the distance is taken in strait lines, instead of the circle. In a wheel of 6 cogs only, the cir|cle will be so much too short, as to give the diameter 2/22 parts of the pitch or distance of the cogs too short. Hence we deduce the fol|lowing.</P>

<P>IN order to conceive a just idea of the most suitable form or shape for cogs in cog-wheels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the fi|gures de|scribed by the cogs of wheels in motion.</NOTE> we must consider, that they describe, with respect to the pitch circles, a figure call|ed an Epicycloid.</P>

<HEAD>Art. 79. Of Spur Gears.</HEAD>
<P>THE principle of Spur Gears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Principles of Spur Gears.</NOTE> is that of two cylinders rolling on each other, with their shafts or axis truly parallel to each other.&mdash;Here the touching parts move with equal ve|locity, therefore have but little friction. And to prevent these cylinders from slipping, we are obliged to indent them, or to set in cogs.&mdash;And here it appears to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pitch of the driver should be the largest.</NOTE> that the pitch of the driving wheel should be a little larger than the leading wheel, for the following reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1. If there is to be any slipping, it will be much easier for the driver to slip a little past the leader, than for the cogs to have to force the leader a little before the driver; which would be very hard on them.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the cogs should bend any by the stress of the work (as they surely do; because 1lb. falling on a beam a foot square, will jar it,
<PB N="50" REF="028644_0218_0FDA2C2D9C74F538">
which cannot be done without bending it a little) this will cause those that are coming into gear to touch too soon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 79.</NOTE> and rub hard at entering.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is much better for cogs to rub hard as they are going out of gear, than as they are coming in; because then they work with the grain of the wood; whereas at entering they work against it, and would wear much faster.</P>
<P>The advantage of this kind of gear is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ad|vantage.</NOTE> we can make the cogs as wide as we please, so that their bearing may be so large that they will not cut each other, but only polish and wear smooth; therefore they will last a long time.</P>

<P N="1">1st. That if the wheels be of different sizes, and the pitch circles are not made to meet ex|actly, they will not run smooth. And,</P>

<HEAD>Art. 80. Of Face Gears.</HEAD>
<P>THE principle of Face Gears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Principle of Face Gears.</NOTE> is that of two cylinders rolling with the side of one on the end of the other, their axis being at right angles. Here the greater the bearing, and the less the diameter of the wheels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have much fric|tion</NOTE> the great|er will be the friction; because the touching parts move with different velocities, therefore the friction will be great.</P>
<P>The advantages of this kind of gear are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ad|vantages</NOTE></P>
<P N="1">1st. Their cogs stand parallel to each other; therefore moving them out or in gear a little, does not alter the pitch of the bearing parts of the cogs, and they will run smoother when their centres are out of place, than spur gears.</P>
<P N="2">2d. They serve for changing the direction of the shafts.</P>
<P>The disadvantages are,</P>

2d. Their great friction and rubbing of parts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 80.</NOTE></P>
<P>The cogs for small wheels are generally round, and put in with round shanks. Great care should be taken in boring the holes for the cogs, with a machine to direct the auger strait, that the distance of the cogs may be equal, without dressing. And all the holes of all the small wheels in a mill should be bored with one auger, and made of one pitch; then the miller may keep by him a quantity of cogs ready turned, to a gauge to suit the auger, and when any fail, he can drive out the old ones, and put in a new set, without much loss of time.</P>
<P>Fig. 40, plate V, represents a face cog-wheel working into a trundle; shewing the necessity of having the corners of the sides of the cogs sniped off in a cycloidical form, to give liberty for the rounds to enter between the cogs, and pass out again freely. To de|scribe the sides of the cogs of the right shape to meet the rounds when they get fairly into gear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Directions for forming the cogs.</NOTE>as at c, there must be a circle described on the ends of the cogs, a little outside of the pitch circle, for the point of the compasses to be set in, to scribe the ends of the cogs; for if the point be set in the pitch circle, it will leave the inner corners too full, and make the out|er ones too scant. The middle of the cog is to be left strait from bottom to top, or nearly so, and the side nearly flat at the distance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> half the diameter of the round from the end,
<PB N="53" REF="028644_0221_0FDA2C32015487C8">
the corners only being sniped off to make the ends of the shape in the figure;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 80.</NOTE> because when the cog comes into gear fully, as at c, there is the chief stress, and there the bearing should be as large as possible. The smaller the cog-wheel, the larger the trundle, and the wider the cogs, the more will the corners require to be sniped off. Suppose the cog-wheel to turn from 40 to b, the cog 40, as it enters, will bear on the lower corner, unless it be suffici|ently sniped off; when it comes to c, it will be fully in gear, and if the pitch of the cog-wheel be a little larger than that of the trun|dle, the cog a will bear as it goes out, and let c fairly enter before it begins to bear.</P>
<P>Suppose the plumb line A B to hang directly to the centre of the cog-wheel, the spindle is (by many mill-wrights) set a little before the line or centre, that the working round or stave of the trundle may be fair with said line, and meet the cog fairly as it comes to bear; it al|so causes the cogs to enter with less, and go out with more friction. Whether there be any real advantage in thus setting the spindle foot before the centre plumb line, does not seem determined.</P>

DA the screen, AF the fan, AB the wind tube, 3 feet deep from A to b, and 4 inches wide, in order that the grain may have a good distance to fall through the wind, to give time and opportunity for the light parts to be carried forward before the heavy parts. Suppose the tube to be of equal depth and width the whole of its length, except where it communicates with the tight boxes or garners under it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> c for the clean wheat, S for the screenings and light wheat, and C for the cheat, chaff, &amp;c.

<P>It is also evident, that if we shut the holes of the fan at A and F, and let no wind into it,
<PB N="58" REF="028644_0226_0FDA2C48374012D0">
none can be forced into the tube;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 83.</NOTE>hence, the best way to regulate the blast is, to fix shutters sliding at the air holes, to give more or less feed of air to the fan, so as to produce a blast sufficient to clean the grain.</P>
<P>The grain is let into the screen at D, into the inmost cylinder, in a small stream. The screen consists of two cylinders of sieve wire, the inmost one has the meshes so open, as to pass all the wheat through it to the outer one, retaining only the white caps, large garlick, and every thing larger than the grain of the wheat, which falls out at the tail A.</P>
<P>The outer cylinder is so close in the mesh, as to retain all good wheat, but sift out the cheat, cockle, small wheat, garlick, and every thing less than good grains of wheat; the wheat is delivered out at the tail of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cylinder, which is not quite as long as the in|ner one, where it drops into the wind tube <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a, and as it falls from a to b, the wind car|ries off every thing lighter than good wheat, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> cheat, chaff, light garlic, dust, and light rotten grains of wheat; but, in order to effect this more completely, it should fall at least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> feet through the current of wind.</P>

If the wind escapes any where but at B, it defeats the scheme, and carries out the dust into the mill. Or fix valves to shut the passages by a weight or spring, so that the weight of the wheat, &amp;c. falling on will open them just enough to let it pass, without suffering any wind to escape.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I have from Timothy Kink, being one principle of his improved fan.</NOTE></P>
<P>Note, The fan is set to blow both the wheat and screenings, and carry the dust out.</P>

<P>By attending duly to the foregoing princi|ple, we may fix fans to answer our purposes.</P>

<P N="1">1. Give the screen 1 inch to the foot fall, and between 15 and 18 revolutions in a mi|nute.</P>

<P N="4">4. Leave no place for the wind to escape, but at the end through the wall.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Art. 84. OF GUDGEONS, THE CAUSE OF THEIR HEAT|ING AND GETTING LOOSE, AND REMEDIES THEREFOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE cause of Gudgeons heating, is the excessive friction of their rubbing parts, which generates the heat in proportion to the weight that presses the rubbing surfaces toge|ther, and the velocity with which they more See art. 31.</P>
<P>The cause of their getting loose is, then heating, and burning the wood, or drying it so that it shrinks in the bands, and gives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gudgeon room to work.</P>
<P>To avoid the effects, we must remove the causes.</P>
<P N="1">1. Increase the surface of contact or rubbing parts, and, if possible, decrease their velocity the heat will not then be generated so much.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="61" REF="028644_0229_0FDA2C529CCE8EB8">
2. Conduct the heat away from the gudgeon as fast as generated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 84.</NOTE>if possible.</P>
<P>To increase the surface of contact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> without increasing its velocity, make the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or bear|ing part of the gudgeon longer. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the length be doubled, the weight will be sustained by a double surface, and velocity the same; there will not then be so much heat generated: and even supposing the same quantity of heat ge|nerated, there will be a double space of sur|face exposed to air, to convey it away.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To understand this subject better, let us consider, that when we strike a flint with steel, we choose the sharpest part of the flint; then the surface of contact is so small, that the force of the stroke creates friction enough to strike or gene|rate fire: But if we strike a thick smooth part of the flint, the force will not be sufficient to strike fire, the surface being too large. Hence we may conclude, that the smaller the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing surface, the greater the heat; and if the surface was so small as to strike fire continually, it would be very difficult to keep the gudgeon cool. If a gudgeon heats at 3 inches bearing on the stone, lengthen it to 6 or 8 inches. I have seen them in use from 2 1-2 to 10 inches bearing on the stone; and those who had the longest (being men of the greatest ex|perience in the milling business) accounted their length to be a good remedy against the heating.</NOTE></P>
<P>To convey the heat away as fast as gene|rated cause a small quantity of water to drop slowly on the gudgeon, to carry off the heat by evaporation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Water is a great conductor of heat, and wonderful is the effect of the principle of evaporation, in carrying off the heat from bodies; every particle of water that evaporates, car|ries off a quantity of heat with it. Dr. Franklin asserts, that by evaporation a man could be froze to death the warmest day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n summer.</NOTE>A small quantity is better than a large; because it should be just suffici|ent to keep up the evaporation, and not de|stroy the polish made by the grease; which it

<P>Oil is said to answer best for spindle feet and step gudgeons tallow for common gudgeons, and black lead mixt with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l|low for cogs, which forms a glossy polish on them that will wear a long time.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The best form that I have seen for large gudgeons for heavy wheels, is made of cast iron. Fig. 6, plate XI, is a perspective view of one; a a a a, are four wings at right angles with each other, extending from side to side of the shaft. These wings are larger, every way, at the end that is farthest in the shaft, than at the outer end, for convenience in cast|ing them, and also that the bands may drive on tight, one over each end of the wings. Fig. 4 is an end view of the shaft, with the gudgeon in it, and a band on the end; these bands, being put on hot, become very tight as they cool, and if the shaft is dry will not, get loose, but will if it is green; but by driving a few wedges along side of each wing, it can be easily fastened, by any ordinary hand, without danger of moving it much from the centre.</P>
<P>One great use of these wings is, to convey away the heat from the gudgeon to the bank, which are in contact with the air; and by
<PB N="63" REF="028644_0231_0FDA2C5CAE45CF58">
thus distributing the heat through so much metal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 84.</NOTE>with so large a surface exposed to the air, the heat is carried off as fast as generated; therefore can never accumulate to a degree sufficient to burn loose, as it will often do in common gudgeons of wrought iron. Wood will not conduct the heat as well as the wings of metal; therefore it accumulates in the small space of the gudgeon, to such a degree as to burn loose.</P>
<P>These gudgeons should be made of the best hard metal, well refined, in order that they may wear well, and not be subject to break; but of this there is but little danger, if the metal is good: should it prove to be the case, I propose to have wings cast separate from the neck, as represented by fig. 4; where the in|side light square shews a mortice for the steeled gudgeon, fig. 7, to be fitted into, with an iron key behind the wings, to draw the gudgeon in tight, if ever it should work loose; by which means it may be taken out, at any time, to repair.</P>
<P>This plan would do well for step gudgeons for heavy upright shafts, such as tub mills, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When the neck is cast with the wings, the square part in the shaft need not be larger than the light square representing the mortice.</P>

<HEAD>Art. 85. ON BUILDING MILL-DAMS, LAYING FOUN|DATIONS, AND BUILDING MILL-WALLS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are several things to be consider|ed, and dangers to be guarded against, in building mill-dams.</P>
<P N="1">1. Construct them so, that the water tum|bling over them, cannot undermine their foun|dations at the lower side.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If you have not a foundation of solid rocks, or so heavy, that the water tumbling over, will never move them, there should be such a foundation made with great stones, not lighter than millstones (if the stream is heavy, and the tumble great) well laid, as low and close as possible, with their upstrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> end lowest, to prevent any thing from catching under the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

On these may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> built the dam, either of stone or wood, leaving 12 or 15 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> below the breast or fall, for the water to fall upon.

<P N="2">2.

The spaces between these log walls, are to be filled up with stones, gravel, &amp;c. Chuse a dry season for this work; then the water will run through the lower part, while you build the upper part tight.</P><P>To prevent any thing from catching against the top log, flag the top of the dam with broad or long stones, laying the downstream end on the upstream side of the log, to extend a little above it, the other end lowest, so that the next tier of stones will lap a little over the first; still getting lower as you advance upstream. This will glance logs, &amp;c. over the dam, without catching against any thing.&amp;If suitable stones cannot be had, I would recommend strong plank, or small logs, laid close together, with both ends pinned to the top logs of the wall, the upstream end being 3 feet lower than the other: But if plank is to be used, there need only be a strong frame raised on the foundation logs, to support the plank, or the timber it is pinned to. See a side view of this frame, fig. 45. plate IV. Some plank the breast to the front posts, and fill the hollow space with stone and gravel; but this may be omitted, if the foundation logs are sufficiently long upstream, under the dam, to prevent the whole from floating away. Stone first, and then gravel, sand and clay, are to be filled in above this frame, so as to stop the water. If the abutments are well secured, the dam will stand well.</P></NOTE></P>

All the stones of a dam should be laid with their upstream ends lowest, and the other end lapped over the pre|ceding, in manner of the shingles or tiles of a house, to glance every thing smoothly over, as at the side 3, of fig. 3, plate X. The breast may be built up with stone, either on a good rock or log foundation putting the best in front, leaning a little upstream, and on the top lay one good log, and another 15 feet upstream on the bottom, to tie the top log to, by se|veral logs, with good buts, downstream, dovetailed and bolted strongly, both at bottom and top of the top and upstream logs; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill in between them with stone and gravel, laying large stones slanting next the top log, to glance any thing over it.

<P N="2">2. Set the centre of gravity, or weight of the wall, on the centre of its foundation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is a common practice to build walls plumb outside, and better them all from the inside; which throws the centre of their gravity to one side of their base. See art.14. There|fore if it settles any, it will incline to fall outwards. Mill-walls should be battered as much outside, as to be equal to the offsets inside, to cause the whole weight to stand on the centre of the foundation, unless it stand against a bank, as the wall next the waggon, in plate VIII. The bank is very apt to press the wall inwards, unless it stands battering. In this case, build the side against the bank plumb, even with the ground, and then begin to batter it inwards. The plumb rules should be made a little widest at the upper end, so as to give the wall the right inclination, according to its height; to do which, take a line, the length equal to the height of the wall, set one end, by a compass point, in the lower end of the plumb rule, and strike the plumb line; then move the other end just as much as the wall is to be battered in the whole height; and it will shew the inclination of the side of the rule that will batter the wall exactly right. This error of building walls plumb outside, is frequently committed in building the abutments of bridges; the consequence is, they fall down in a short time; because the earth between the walls is expanded a little by every hard frost, and tumbles the walls over.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>Concerning Lime, Mortar and Grout.</HEAD>
<P>I have, from my childhood, been well acquainted with the nature of lime and sand made into mortar, of all sorts that have been used in buildings in these countries, and tried nu|merous experiments with them. On which, together with what I have observed and learned from old experienced workmen, during the course of upwards of sixty years, I think I can safely affirm, that good mortar, that is made of pure and well burnt limestone, properly made up with sharp clean sand, free from any sort of earth, loam or mud, will, within some considerable time, actually petrify, and, as it were, turn to the consistency of a stone. I remember I had one of my remarks from an old Scotch mason; which I shall give you in his own identical words: that is,
<Q><L>When a hundred years are past and gane,</L>
<L>Then gude mortar is grown to a stain (or stone.)</L></Q></P>
<P>I need not explain what I mean by sharp clean sand; but I shall give you this one caution, that it is better to put too much sand in your mortar, than too little. I know workmen choose to have their mortar rich, because it works pleasanter; but rich mortar will not stand the weather so well, nor grow so hard, as poor mortar will do. If it was all lime, it would have no more strength, in comparison, than clay.</P>

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="description">
<HEAD> 1. Of the Elevator.</HEAD>
<P>THE Elevator is an endless strap,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Ele|vator.</NOTE>revolv|ing over two pullies, one of which is set where the grain or meal, &amp;c. is to be hoisted from, and the other where it is to be hoisted to; to this strap is fastened a number of small buckets, which fill themselves as they pass un|der the lower pulley, and empty as they pass over the upper one. To prevent waste of what may spill out of these buckets, the strap, buckets and pullies, are all enclosed, and work in tight cases; so that what spills will descend to the place from whence it was hoisted. A B, in fig. 1, plate VI,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate VI. Fig. 1.</NOTE>is an elevator for raising grain, which is let in at A, and discharged at B into the spouts leading to the different gar|ners. Fig.2 is a perspective view of the strap,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 2.</NOTE>

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="description">
<HEAD>2. Of the Conveyer.</HEAD>
<P>The Conveyer K I,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conveyer.</NOTE>fig. 1, is an endless screw of two continued spires, put in motion in a trough; the grain is let in at one end, and the screw drives it to the other, or collects it to the centre, as at y, to run into the eleva|tor (see plate VIII, 37&mdash;36&mdash;4, and 44&mdash;45) or it is let in at the middle, and convey|ed each way, as 15&mdash;16, plate VIII.</P>
<P>Fig. 3,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 3.</NOTE>is a top view of the lower pully of a meal elevator in its case, and a meal convey|er in its trough, for conveying meal from the stones, as fast as ground, into the elevator. This is an 8 sided shaft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meal Con|veyer.</NOTE>set on all sides with small inclining boards, called flights, for con|veying the meal from one end of the trough to the other; these flights are set in a spiral line, as shewn by the dotted line; but being set across said line, changes the principle of the machine from a screw to that of plows, which is found to answer better for conveying warm meal.</P>
<P>Besides these conveying flights, half their number of others are sometimes necessary; which are called lifters, and set with their broadsides foremost, to raise the meal from one side, and let it fall on the other side of the shaft to cool: these are only used where the meal is hot, and the conveyer short. See 21&mdash;22, in plate VIII: which is a conveyer, carrying the meal from 3 pair of stones to the elevator, 23&mdash;24.</P>

<HEAD>3. Of the Hopper-boy.</HEAD>
<P>Fig. 12, plate VII,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 12. Of the Hopper-boy</NOTE>is a Hopper-boy; which consists of a perpendicular shaft, AB, put in a slow motion, (not above 4 revolutions in a mi|nute) carrying round with it the horizontal piece CD, which is called the arms, and set, on the under side, full of small inclining boards, call|ed flights, so set as to gather the meal towards the centre, or spread it from the centre to that part of the arm which passes over the bolting hopper; at which part, one board is set broad-side foremost, as E (called a sweeper) which drives the meal before it, and drops it into the hoppers HH, as the arms pass over them. The meal is generally let fall from the eleva|tor, at the extremity of the arm, at D, where there is a sweeper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweepers, their use.</NOTE>which drives the meal be|fore it, trailing it in a circle the whole way round, so as to discharge nearly the whole of its load, by the time it returns to be loaded again: the flights then gather it towards the centre, from every part of the circle; which would not be the case, if the sweepers did not lay it round; but the meal would be gathered from only one side of the circle. These sweep|ers are screwed on the back of the arm, so that they may be raised or lowered, in order to make them discharge sooner or later, as ne|cessary.</P>
<P>The extreme flight of each end of the arms are put on with a screw passing through its centre, so that they may be turned to drive the meal outwards; the use of which is, to spread the warm meal as it falls from the ele|vator,
<PB N="76" REF="028644_0242_0FDA2C7AB2AECAE0">
in a ring round the hopper-boy, while it at the same time gathers the cool meal into the bolting hopper; so that the cold meal may be bolted, and the warm meal spread to cool, by the same machine, at the same time, if the miller chuses so to do. The foremost edge of these arms is sloped up, in order to make them rise over the meal, and its weight is nearly balanced by the weight w, hung to one end of a cord passing over the pulley P, and to the stay iron F. About 4 1-2 feet of the lower end of the upright shaft is made round, passing loosely through a round hole in the flight arm, giving it liberty to rise and fall freely, to suit any quantity of meal under it. The flight arm is led round by the leading arm LM, by a cord passing through the holes LM, at each end, and made fast to the flight arm DC. This cord is lengthened or shortened by a hitch-stick N, with two holes for the cord to pass through, the end of the cord being passed through a hole at D, and fastened to the end of the stick; this cord must reeve freely thro' the holes at the ends of the arms, in order that the ends may both be led equally. The flight arm falls behind the leader about 1-6th part of the circle. The stay-iron CFE, is a ring at F, which fits the shaft loosely, and is for keep|ing the arm steady, and hanging the ends of an equal height by the screws. CE.</P>

<HEAD>4. Of the Drill.</HEAD>
<P>The Drill is an endless strap revolving over two pullies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drill.</NOTE>like an elevator, but set nearly horizontal, and instead of buckets, there are small rakes fixed to the strap, which draw the grain or meal along the bottom of the case. See GH, in plate VI, fig. 1. The grain is let in at H, and discharged at G. This can sometimes be applied with less expence than a conveyer; if it is set a little descending, it will move grain or meal with ease, and will do well even a little ascending.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="description">
<HEAD>5. Of the Descender.</HEAD>
<P>The Descender is a broad endless strap of every thin pliant leather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Descender.</NOTE>canvass, or flannel, &amp;c. revolving over two pullies, which turn on small pivots, in a case or trough, to prevent waste, one end of which is to be lower than the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 1.</NOTE>See EF, fig. 1. The grain or meal falls from the elevator on the upper strap, at E, and by its own gravity and fall, sets the machine in motion, and it discharges the load over the lower pulley F. There are two small buckets to bring up what may spill or fall off the strap, and lodge in the bottom of the case.</P>
<P>This machine moves on the principles of an overshot water-wheel, and will convey meal

a considerable distance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 88.</NOTE>with a small descent. Where a motion is easily obtained from the water, it is to be preferred to that of working itself, it being easily stopped, is apt to be trou|blesome.</P>
<P>The Crain Spout is hung on a shaft to turn on pivots or a pin, so that it may turn every way, like a crane; into this spout the grain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> falls from the elevator, and, by turning, it can be directed into any garner. The spout is made to fit close, and play under a broad board, and the grain is let into it through the middle of this board, near the pin, so that it will always enter the spout. See it under B fig. 1. L is a view of the under side of it, and M is a top view of it.

<P>There should, for convenience of counting, be weights of 60lbs. each; divided into 30, 15 and 7 1-2lbs. then each weight would shew a bushel of wheat, and the smaller ones halves, pecks, &amp;c. which any one could count with case.</P>
<P>When the wheat is weighed, draw the gate at the bottom of the scale, and let it run into the garner&punc; 3; at the bottom of which there is a gate to let it into the elevator 4&mdash;5, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it to 5, and the crane spout being turn|ed over the great store garner 6, which com|municates from floor to floor, to garner 7, over the stones 8, which suppose to be for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">elling or rubbing the wheat, before it is ground, to take off all dust that sticks to the grain, to break smut or fly-eaten grain, lumps of dust, &amp;c.

which conveys it into all the garners over the stones 7&mdash;17&mdash;18, and these regularly supply the stones 8&mdash;19&mdash;20, keeping always an equal quantity in the hoppers, which will cause them to feed regularly; as it is ground the meal falls to the conveyer 21&mdash;22, which collects it to the meal elevator, at 23, and it is raised to 24, whence it gently runs down the spout to the hopper-boy at 25, which spreads and cools it sufficiently, and gathers it into the bolting hoppers, both of which it attends regularly; as it passes through the superfine cloths 26, the superfine flour falls into the packing chest 28, which is on the second floor: If the flour is to be loaded on waggons, it should be packed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this floor, that it may conveniently be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into them; but if the flour is to be put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> board a vessel, it will be more convenience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pack on the lower floor, out of chest 29, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> roll it into the vessel at 30.

<P>The middlings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Middlings ground over with the wheat.</NOTE>as they fall, are conveyed into the eye of either pair of millstones by the conveyer 31&mdash;32, and ground over with the wheat; which is the best way of grinding them, because the grain keeps them from be|ing killed, and there is no time lost in doing it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which saves labour and time.</NOTE>and they are regularly mixed with the flour.

<P>The light grains of wheat, screenings, &amp;c. after being blown by the fan 13, fall into the screenings garner 32; the chaff is driven fur|ther on, and settles in the chaff-room 33; the greater part of the dust will be carried out with the wind through the wall.

<P>In some instances, a short elevator, with the centre of the upper pulley, 38, fixed im|movable, the other end standing on the deck, so much aslant as to give the vessel liberty to raise and lower, the elevator sliding a little on the deck. The case of the lower strap of this elevator must be considerably crooked, to pre|vent the points of the buckets from wearing by rubbing in the descent.

garners are all made like hoppers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 91.</NOTE> about 4 inches wide at the floor, and nearly the length of the garner; but as it passes through the next story, it is brought to the form of a spout 4 inches square, leading down to the general spout KA, which leads to the eleva|tor; in each of these spouts is a gate number|ed; with the number of its garner; so that when we want to grind the parcel in garner 2, we draw the gate 2 in the lower spout, to let the wheat run into the elevator at A, to be elevated into the crane-spout B, which is to be turned over the rolling-screen, as shewn in plate VIII.</P>
<P>Under the upper tier of garners, there is an|other tier in the next story, set so that the spouts from the bottom of the upper tier pass down the partitions of the lower tier, and the upper spouts of the lower tier pass between the partitions of the upper tier, to the garner-spout.</P>
<P>These garners, and the gates leading both into and out of them, are numbered as the others.</P>
<P>If it is not convenient to fix the descending spouts BC, to convey the wheat from the ele|vator to the garners, and KA to convey it from the garners to the elevator again, then the conveyers r-s and l-k may be used for said purposes.</P>
<P>To keep the parcels separate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meal kept separate.</NOTE> there should be a crane-spout to the meal elevator, or any other method, by which the meal of the se|cond parcel may be guided to fall on another part of the floor, until the first parcel is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bolted, and the chests cleared out, when the

<P>I must here observe, that in mills for grind|ing parcels, the tail flour must be hoisted by a separate elevator to the hopper-boy, to be bolted over, and not run into the conveyer, as shewn in plate VIII; because then the parcels could not be kept separate.</P>
<P>The advantages of the machinery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advantages gained.</NOTE> applied to a mill for grinding parcels, are very great.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because without them there is much la|bour in moving the different parcels from place to place, all which is done by the machinery.</P>
<P N="2">2. The meal, as it is ground, is cooled by the machinery, in so short a time, and bolted, that when the grinding is done, the bolting is also nearly finished: Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. It saves room, because the meal need not be spread over the floor to cool, there to lay 12 hours as usual, and none but one parcel need be on the floor at once.</P>
<P N="4">4. It gives greater dispatch, as the mill need never stop either stones or bolts, in order to keep parcels separate. The screenings of each parcel may be cleaned, as directed in art. 89, with very little trouble; and the flour may be nearly packed before the grinding is finished. So that if a parcel of 60 bushels arrive at the mill in the evening, the owner may wait till morning, when he may have it all finished; he may use the off all for feed for his team, and proceed with his load to market.</P>

<P>If he does not choose to let the meal run immediately into the bags, he may have a box made with feet to stand in the place of the bags, for the meal to fall in, out of which it may be taken, and put into the bags, by the miller or the owner, as fast as it is bolted, and mixed as desired; and as soon as the first parcel is bolted, the little gates at the mouth of the bags may be shut, while the meal is fill|ed out of the box, and the second grist may be bolting.</P>

The elevator and drill should be so made as to clean out at one revolution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 92.</NOTE> The drill might have a brush or two, instead of rakes, which would sweep the case clean at a revo|lution; and the shoe of the bolting-hopper should be short and steep, so that it will clean out soon.</P>
<P>The same machinery may be used for mer|chant-work, by having a cranespout at C, or a small gate, to turn the meal into the hopper-boy that tends the merchant bolt.</P>
<P>A mill thus constructed, might grind grists in the day-time, and merchant-work at night.</P>
<P>A drill is preferable to a conveyer for grist-mills, because they will clean out much sooner and better. The lower pulley of the elevator is twice as large in diameter as the pullies of the drill; the lower pulley of the elevator, and one pulley of the drill, are on the same shaft, close together, the elevator moves the drill, and the pulley of the drill being small|est, gives room for the meal to fall into the buck|ets of the elevator.</P>

<P>Fig. 6 represents the gudgeon of the lower pulley; fig. 7 the gudgeon for the shaft, on which the upper pulley is fixed. Fix both the pulleys in their places, but not firmly, so that a line stretched from one pulley to the other, will cross the shafts or gudgeons at right an|gles.

The shaft passing through this pulley is made round where the case fits to it: half circles are cut out of two boards, so that they meet and em|brace it closely. The undermost board, where it meets the shaft, is ciphered off inside next the pulley, to guide the grain inward.

This will best suit where the shaft is short,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 95.</NOTE> and has to be moved to put the elevator out, and in gear.</P>
<P>The way that I have generally cased the pulleys is as follows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Common way of casing them.</NOTE> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The top board of the upper strap-case, and the bottom board of the lower strap-case are extended past the lower pulley to rest on the floor; and the lower ends of these boards are made two inches narrower, as far as the pulley-case ex|tends; the side board of the pulley is nailed, or rather screwed, to them with wooden screws. The rest of the case boards join to the top of the pulley-case, both being of one width. The blocks which the gudgeons of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pulley run in, are screwed fast to the out|side of the case boards; the gudgeons do not pass quite through, but reach to the bottom of the hole, which keeps the pulley in its place.</P>
<P>The said top and bottom boards, and also the side boards of the strap-cases, are extend|ed; past the upper pulley, and the side boards of the pulley-case are screwed to them; but this leaves a vacancy between the top of the side boards of the strap-cases, and shoul|ders for the buckets to catch against. This vacancy is to be filled up by a short board, guiding the buckets safely over the upper pul|ley. The case must be as close to the points of the buckets, where they empty, as is safe, that as little as possible may fall down again. There is to be a long hole cut into the case at B, for the wheat to fall out at,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 1. pl. VI.</NOTE> and a short spout guiding it into the crane-spout. The top of the short spout next B, should be loosely fastened in with a button, that it may be ta|ken

<P>The wheat should be let in at the bottom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Let the wheat in at the bot|tom to prevent its choaking.</NOTE> as meet the buckets, and a gate to shut as near the point of them as possible, as at A, fig. 1.

If it be in any case let in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> distance up, the gate should be so fixed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it cannot be drawn so far, as to let in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> faster than the buckets can take it, else <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> case will fill and stop the buckets.

<HEAD>Directions for using a Hopper-Boy.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. When the meal-elevator is set in motion to elevate the meal, the hopper-boy must be set in motion also, to spread and cool it; and as soon as the circle is full, the boults may be started; the grinding and boulting may like|wise be carried on together regularly, which is the best way of working.</P>
<P N="2">2. But if you do not choose to boult as you grind, turn up the feeding sweepers, and let the hopper-boy spread and cool the meal, and rise over it; and when you begin to boult turn them down again.</P>
<P N="3">3. If you choose to keep the warm meal se|parate from the cool, shovel about 18 inches of the outside of the circle in towards the centre, and turn the end flights, to drive the meal outwards, it will spread the warm meal out|wards, and gather the cool meal in the boult|ing-hopper. As soon as the ring is full with warm meal, rake it out of the reach of the hopper-boy, and let it fill again.</P>
<P N="4">4. To mix tail-flour or bran, &amp;c. with a quantity of meal that is under the hopper-boy, make a hole for it in the meal quite to the floor, and put it in; and the hopper-boy will mix it regularly with the whole.</P>
<P N="5">5. If it does not keep the hopper full, turn the feeding sweeper a little lower, and throw a little meal on the top of the arm, to make it sink deeper into the meal. If the spread|ing

<P>DR. Wistar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Late philoso|phical disco|veries, shew|ing why meal is so soon made fit for boulting by the ma|chines.</NOTE> of Philadelphia, had discovered and proved by many experiments (which he communicated to the American philosophical society, and which they have published in the 3rd volume of their transactions) that cold is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> principal agent in causing moisture to eva|porate from bodies; and the fact is evident from daily observation, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that it is the dif|ferent degrees of heat and cold, between the air and bodies, that causes them to cast off or contract moisture.</P>
<P N="1">1st. We see in all sudden transitions from an extreme cold air to a warm, that the walls of houses, stones, ground, and every thing that retains cold, contracts moisture; and it certainly has the same effect on meal.</P>
<P N="2">2. In all sudden changes from warm to cold, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thing casts off its moisture; for instance, what great quantities of water will disappear
<PB N="122" REF="028644_0286_0FDA2D07757D38D8">
from the ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 121.</NOTE> in one cold night: this is the reason why meal being warm gets so dry in cold weather, and bolts so free; whereas it is always harder to bolt when there is a change from cold to warm.</P>
<P N="3">3. If you warm a razor, or a glass, warm|er than your breath, neither of them will be sullied by it.</P>
<P N="4">4. Fill a glass-bottle with cold water in a warm day, and wipe it dry, and there will be presently seen on its outside large drops, col|lected from the moisture of the air, though the bottle still continues full.</P>
<P>From these instances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meal should be spread thin while hot, and it will cast out the moisture, and will not breed worms.</NOTE> it is evident, that the meal should be spread as thin as possible, and be kept in motion from the moment it leaves the stones, until it is cold, that it may have a fair opportunity of casting off its moisture, which will be done more effectually in that time, that can possibly be effected in warm weather, in any reasonable time, after it has grown out in a heap and retained its moisture; and there is no time for insects to deposit their eggs that may in time breed the worms, that are often found in the heart of barrels of flour are packed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boults better,</NOTE> and by the moisture being cast and more effectually, it will not be so apt to found.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And does the work to geeater per|fection.</NOTE> Therefore one great advantage is that <HI>the meal is better prepared for boulting, packing and keep|ing in much less time.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They do the work to much greater perfection</HI> by cleaning the grain and screenings more ef|fectually, hoisting and bolting over great parts of the flour, and grinding and boulting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the middlings, all at one operation, mixing those parts that are to be mixed, and separat|ing

<P N="3">3. <HI>They save much meal from being wasted,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">With less waste.</NOTE> if they be well constructed, because there is no necessity of trampling in it, which trails it wherever we walk, **nor shoveling it about to raise a dust that flies away, &amp;c.

<P N="4">4. <HI>They afford more room than they take up,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Afford more room.</NOTE> because the whole of the meal-loft that here|tofore was little enough to cool the meal on, may now be spared for other uses, except the circle described by the hopper-boy; and the wheat-garners may be filled from one sto|ry to another, up to the crane-spout, above the collar-beams; so that a small part of the house will hold a great quantity of wheat, and it may be drawn from the bottom into the ele|vator as wanted.</P>

<HEAD>Art. 103. A Mill for hulling and cleaning Rice.</HEAD>
<P>PLATE X. fig. 2. The rice brought to the mill in boats, is to be emptied into the hopper 1, out of which it is conveyed, by the conveyer, into the elevator at 2, which ele|vates it into the garner 3; on the third floor it descends into the garner 4, that hangs over the stones 5, and supplies them regularly. The stones are to be dressed with a few deep furrows, with out little draught, and picked full of large holes; they must be set more than the length of the grain apart. The hoop should be lined inside with strong sheet-iron, and if punched full of holes it will do better. The grain is kept under the stone as long as neces|sary, by causing it to rise some distance up the hoop, to get out through a hole, which is to be made higher or lower by a gate, slid|ing in the bottom of it.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="028644_0297_0FDA2D2831BBBC38">
The principle by which the grain is hulled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 103.</NOTE> is that of rubbing them against one another with great force, between the stones, by which means they hull one another, without being broke by the stones, near as much as by the usual way.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By trying many experiments, and with much labour, striving to invent a new machine for rubbing the dust off the grains of wheat, and breaking the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eaps of dust mixed with wheat that is tread on the ground; and for shelling of the white caps, breaking the rotten, fly-eaten, and smut grains, and to break the garlick, &amp;c. I discovered this principle; which I afterwards used with a common pair of bur mill-stones, properly dressed for grinding wheat, and always found it to succeed well, without breaking any good grains, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the white caps to fine dust.</NOTE> As it passes through the stones 5, it should fall into a rolling-screen or shak|ing-sieve 6, made of wire, with such mashes as will let out, at the head, all the sand and dust, which may be let run through the floor into the water, if convenient: and to let the rice and most of the heavy chaff fall through into the conveyer, which will convey it into the elevator at 2. The light chaff, &amp;c. that does not pass through the sieve, will fall out at the tail, and if useless may also run into the water, and float away. There may be a fan put on the spindle, above the trundle, to make a light blast, to blow out the light chaff and dust, which should be conveyed out through the wall: and this fan may supersede the necessity of the shaking-sieve. The grain and heavy chaff are elevated into garner 7, thence it de|scends into garner 8, and passes through the stones 9, which are to be fixed and dressed the same way as the others, and are only to rub the grain harder: the sharpness on the outside of the chaff (which nature seems to have pro|vided for the pupose) will cut off all the inside hull from the grain, and leave it perfectly clean; then, as it falls from these stones
<PB N="134" REF="028644_0298_0FDA2E23F99CD338">
it passes through the wind of the fan 10,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 103.</NOTE> fixed on the spindle of the stones 9, which will blow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the chaff and dust, and drop them in the room 21: the wind should escape through the wall. There is a regulating board that moves on a joint at 21, so as to take all the grain into the conveyer, which will con|vey it into the elevator at 11, which elevates it into the garner 12, to pass through the roll|ing-screen 13, which should have wire of 3 sized mashes: first, to take out the dust, to fall into a part 17, by itself; second, the small rice into an apartment 16; the whole grains fall into garner 14, perfectly clean, and are drawn into barrels at 15. The fan 18 blows out the dust, and lodges it in the room 19, and the wind passes out at 20; the head rice falls at the tail of the screen, and runs into the hopper of the stones 5, to go through the whole operation again. Thus the whole is completely done by the water, by the help of the machinery from the boat, until ready to put into the barrel, without the least manual labour.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be necessary to make a few furrows in the edge of the stone, slanting, at an angle of about 30 degrees with a perpendicu|lar line, these furrows will throw up the grain next the stone, on the top of that in the hoop which will change its position continually, by which means it will be better cleaned: but this may probably be done without.</P>

<DIV4 N="104" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Art. 104.</HEAD>
<P>THE end we have in view, in grinding the grain, is, to reduce it to such a de|gree of fineness, as is found by experience to make the best bread, and to put it in such a state, that the flour may be most effectually separated from the bran or skin of the grain, by means of sifting or bolting: and it has been proved by experience, that to grind the grain fine with dull mill-stones, will not answer said purpose well, because it kills or destroys that lively quality of the grain, that causes it

to ferment and raise in the baking:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 104.</NOTE> it also makes the meal so clammy, that it sticks to the cloth, and chokes up the mashes in bolt|ing. Hence it appears, that it should be made fine with as little pressure as possible; and it is evident, that this cannot be done without sharp instruments. Let us suppose we under|take to operate on one single grain, I think it seems reasonable, that we should first cut it into several pieces, with a sharp instrument, to put it in a state, suitable for being passed between two plains, in order to be reduced to one regular fineness. The planes should have on their faces a number of little sharp edges, to-scrape off the meal from the bran, and be set at such a distance, as to reduce the meal to the required fineness, and no finer, so that no part can escape unground. The same rules or principles will serve for a quanti|ty, that will serve for one grain.</P>
<P>Therefore, to prepare the stones for grind|ing to the greatest perfection, we may con|clude that their faces must be put in such or|der, that they will first cut the grain into se|veral pieces, and then pass it between them, in such a manner, that none can escape with|out being ground to a certain degree of fine|ness, and at the same time scrape the meal off clean from the bran or skin.</P>
<P N="1">1. The best way that I have yet found to effect this is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The best way of facing and sharpening stones.</NOTE> (after the stones are faced with the staff and the pick) to grind a few quarts of sharp fine sand; this will face them to fit each other so exactly, that no meal can pass between them, without being ground: it is also the best way of sharpening all the little
<PB N="141" REF="028644_0303_0FDA20217A28DAE0">
edges on the face,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 104.</NOTE> that are formed by the pores of the stone, (but instead of sand, water may be used, the stones then face each other) so that they will scrape the meal off of the bran, without too much pressure being applied. But as the meal will not pass from the centre to the periphery or verge of the stones, soon enough, without some assistance, there must be a number of furrows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There must be furrows in the stone.</NOTE> to assist it in its egress; and these furrows must be set with such a draught, that the meal will not pass too far along them at once, without passing over the land or plain, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t it should get out unground. They should also be of sufficient depths, to ad|mit air enough to pass though the stones to carry out the heat generated by the friction of grinding;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their use.</NOTE> but if they have too much draught, they will not bear to be deep, for the meal will escape along them unground. These furrows ought to be made sharp at the feather edge (which is the hinder edge of the furrow, and the foremost edge of the land) which serves the purpose of cutting down the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; they should be more numerous near the centre, because there the office of the stone is to cut the grain, and near the periphe|ry their office is (that of the two plains) to reduce the flour to its required fineness, and scrape the bran clean by the edges, formed by the numerous little pores with which the burr stone abounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Should be very hard near the eye.</NOTE> However, we must consider, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is not best to have the stones too sharp near the eye, because they then cut the bran <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fine. The stones incline to keep open near the eye, unless they are too close. If they are porous (near the eye) and will keep open
<PB N="142" REF="028644_0304_0FDA2D2BC7DC92C0">
without picking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 104.</NOTE> they will always be a little dull, which will flatten the bran, without cut|ting it too much. Again, if they be soft next the eye, they will keep too open, and that part of the stone will be nearly useless. There|fore they should be very hard and porous.</P>
<P>It is also necessary, that we dress the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the stone in such a form, as to allow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for the grain or meal, in every stage of its passage between the stones. In order to un|derstand this, let us conceive the stream<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> wheat, entering the eye of the stone, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> about the thickness of a man's finger, but in|stantly spreading every way over the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> face of the stone; therefore this stream <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> get thinner, as it approaches the periph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> (where it would be thinner than a fine hair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their faces should touch only 10 inches from the skirts.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it did not pass slower as it becomes finer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if the stones were not kept apart by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for this reason the stones must be dressed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that they will not touch at the centre, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> about a 16th or 20th part of an inch, but to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> closer gradually, till within about 10 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> inches from the verge of the stone, proportion|ed to the diameter, and from that part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they must fit nicely together.

In the central dress E A the furrows have all one draught,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 105.</NOTE> and if we could once determine how much is necessary exactly, then we might expect to be right, and I presume we will find it to be in a certain proportion to the size and velocity of the stone; because, the centrifugal force that the circular motion of the stone gives the meal, has a tendency to move it out|ward, and this force will be in inverse propor|tion to the diameter of the stones; their veloci|ties being the same by the 4th law of circular motion. E e is a furrow of the running stone, and we may see by the figure, that the fur|rows cross one another at the centre in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> greater angle than near the periphery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I conceive to be right, because the centrifugal force is much less nearer the centre than the periphery. But we must also consider, that the grain, whole or but little broken, requires less draught and central force to send it out, than it does when ground fine; which shews, that we must here differ in practice from the theories laid down in art. 13, founded on the laws of circular motion and central forces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be|cause, the grain as it is ground into meal, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> effected by the central force to drive it out, therefore the angles with which the furrows cross each other must be greater near the verge or skirt of the stone, and less near its centre than assigned by theory, and this variation from theory can be formed only by conjecture, and ascertained by practice.</P>

This ought to be carefully attended to by the maker, because the stone may be made to balance truly when at rest; yet, if every opposite part does not balance each other truly, the stone may be greatly out of balance when in motion, although truly balanced at rest: and this is the reason why the bush of some stones cannot be kept tight but a few hours, while others will keep tight several months, the spindles being good, and stones balanced when at rest. The reason why a stone that is ba|lanced at rest, will sometimes not be balanced in motion, is, that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up|per side be heaviest on one side, and the lowest side be heaviest on the other side of the centre, the stone may balance at rest, yet, when set in motion the heaviest parts draw outwards more by the centrifugal force, which will put the stone out of balance while in motion: and this argues in favour of a stiff ryne. The best method that I have heard of for hanging stones with stiff horned rynes, appears to be as follows: Fix a screw to each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> regulate by, which is done thus&mdash;after the horns are beded, sink under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> horn a strong bur, through which the screw is to pass from the back of the stone, and fasten them in with lead; then, after the stone is laid down, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the screws from the top of the stone, screwing them till the points bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the horn: then proceed to hang the stone, which is very easily done, by turning the screws.</NOTE> but if we have a stiff-ryne, it will be much more difficult, because we have not only to fix the spindle perpendi|cular to the face of the bed-stone, but we must set the face of the runner perpendicular to the spindle, and all this must be done to the greatest exactness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stiff ryne.</NOTE> because the ryne being still, will not give way to suffer the runner to form itself to the bed-stone, as will the ba|lance-ryne.</P>
<P>The bed of the ryne being first carefully cleaned out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Directions for hanging a stone with a stiff ryne.</NOTE> the ryne is put into it and tied, until the stone is laid down on the cock-head; then we find the part that hangs lowest, and by putting the hand thereon, we press the stone down a little, turning it about at the same time, and observing, whether that low|est

part touches the bed-stone equally all the way round;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 107.</NOTE> if it does not, it is adjusted by altering the wedges of the bridge-tree, un|til it touches equally, and then the spindle will stand perpendicular to the face of the bed-stone. Then, to set the face of the runner perpendicular or square to the spindle, we stand in one place, turning the stone, and pressing on it at every horn of the ryne, as it passes, and observing whether the runner will touch the bed-stone equally, at every horn, which, if it does not, we strike with an iron bar on the horn, that bears the stone highest, which, by its jaring, will settle itself better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its bed, and thereby let the stone down a little in that part; but if this be not suffici|ent there must be paper put on the top of the horn, that lets the stone too low; observ|ing to mark the high horns, that when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is taken up, a little may be taken off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the bed, and the ryne will soon become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> neatly beded, that the stone will hang very easily.

See art. 104.</P>
<P>Mill-stones are generally but very carelessly and slightly made, where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, they should be made with the greatest care and to the greatest nicety.

<P>And 2ndly, to review all the moving gudge|ons of the mill, to see whether any of them want grease, &amp;c. that he may know what care may be necessary for them during his watch; for want of this the gudgeons often run dry, and heat, which brings on heavy losses of time and repairs; for when they heat, they get a little loose, and the stones they run on crack; after which they cannot be kept cool. He should also see what quantity of grain is over the stones, and if there be not enough to supply them till morning, set the cleaning machines in motion.</P>
<P>All things being set right, his duty is very easy&mdash;he has only to see the machinery, the grinding, and bolting, once in an hour; he has therefore plenty of time to amuse himself in reading, &amp;c. rather than going to sleep, which is not safe.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>I BEING requested by Oliver Evans, to assist him in completeing his book, entitled, The Young Mill-wright and Miller's Guide&mdash;have thought proper to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reader a short history of the rise and progress of mer|chant mills, towards their present state of perfection, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ce the beginning of my time.</P>
<P>It is now upwards of 38 years since I first began mill-wrighting: I followed it very constant for about ten years, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">king it my particular study. Several of my brothers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> also mill-wrights, we kept in company; and were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> called to different parts of this, and the adjacent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">es, to build mills of the first rates, in their day. Some of them entered into the manufacturing line, but I con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed at mill-wrighting, and other business connected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">herewith; such as rolling screens, and fans, and mak|ing them to go by water, in merchant and grist mills; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> farmers fans, for cleaning grain; being the first, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">eve that made these things in America: but for se|veral years past, have done but little else, than build <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or draught to build by.</P>
<P>When I first began the business, mills were at a low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in this country; neither burr-stones, nor rolling screens being used; and but few of the best merchant mills had a fan. Many carried the meal on their backs, and bolted it by hand, even for merchant work; and I have frequently heard, that a little before my beginning the business, it had been customary, in many instances, to have the bolting mill some distance from the grind|ing mill, and there bolted by hand. It was counted ex|traordinary
<PB N="vi" REF="028644_0359_0FDA2DEBB13E0888">
when they got their bolting to go by water: after this, fans by hand, and standing screens took place; then bur-stones, rolling-screens, and superfine bolting cloths, with a number of other improvements. Some of the latest are, the Elevators, hopper-boys, &amp;c.&mdash;Invented by Oliver Evans, late of Delaware, tho' now of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Being very desirous to improve in the art of building mills, and manufacturing grain into flour, I have fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> frequently went a considerable distance to see new im|provements, and have often searched the book-stores <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> expectation of finding books that might instruct me, but never found any which was of use to me in that respect more than to learn the ancient names of some parts of the mills; for although they had been wrote by men of considerable learning, in other respects; yet, as they had never been mill-wrights themselves, they had neither practical, nor experimental knowledge to direct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the work. For instance, see the mill-wrights table, in Ferguson's lectures, page 79.; where the cog-wheel is to have 127 cogs, about 15&frac12; feet diameter; trundle 6 staves, and stones 6 feet: And in Imison's introduction to useful knowledge, page 31, the water-wheel is to be 18 feet, cog-wheel 254 cogs, about 31 feet diameter, much higher than the water-wheel;&mdash;staves in the trun|dle 6, and stones 4 2/1; feet. Besides, some have asserted, that water applied on an undershot wheel, will do 6 times as much as if applied on an overshot; others, that if applied on an overshot it will do 10 times as much as an undershot, the quantity and falls being equal: many other parts of their theories are equally wrong, in prac|tice. So that what knowledge I have gained, has been by steady attention to the improvements of our own country; I have wondered, that no person of prac|tical knowledge in the art, has yet attempted to write a treatise on it, seeing it is a subject worthy attention,
<PB N="vii" REF="028644_0360_0FDA2DF548E84600">
and such a book so much wanted. The manufacturing of our own country produce, in the most saving, ex|peditious, and best manner, I have thought, is a sub|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t worthy the attention of the legislatures. Mills are often laid under heavy taxes, being supposed to be very suitable; but if all the spare wheat was to be shipped, where would the miller's profit be. But to return to the subject&mdash;I have often thought, that if I could spare time would write a small treatise on mill-wrighting myself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">king it would be of much use to young mill-wrights) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fearing I was not equal to the task, I was ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it up, but on further consideration, I called on Tho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> Dobson, printer of the Encyclopedia; and asked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if he would accept of a small treatise on mill-wright<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">: he said Oliver Evans had been there a few days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and proposed such a work, which I thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> save me the trouble. But some time afterwards, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> said Evans, applied to me, requesting my assistance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> undertaking; this I was the more willing to do, ha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> built several mills with his additional improvements; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> draughted several others&mdash;and without which im|provements, I think a mill cannot now be said to be com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">.

And I do believe, that taking a large quantity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat together, that we can make 2 or 3lbs. more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a bushel by the new, than by the old way, though it be equally well ground; because it is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more completely bolted, and with less waste. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> old way, the wheat is weighed and carried up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or two pair of stairs, and thrown into garners; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> often having holes in, it is spilt and trampled un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> foot; several lbs. being frequently lost in receiv|ing a small quantity; and when it is taken from these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ers, and carried to the rolling screens, some is again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed, and as it is ground, it is shoveled into tubs, a

dust is raised, and some spilt and trampled on; it is there hoisted, and spread, and tossed about with shovels, over a large floor, raked and turned to cool, and shoveled up again, and put into the bolting hopper; all which occa|sions great labour, besides being spilt and trampled over the mill, which occasions a considerable waste. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> these disadvantages, there are others in attending the bolting hoppers; being often let run empty, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> too hard, so that they choke, which occasions the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be very unevenly bolted; sometimes too poor, and at other times too rich, which is a considerable loss; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> when the flour is bolted, it is much finer at the head that the tail of the cloths: the fine goes through first, and has to be mixed by hand, with shovels or rakes; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> labour is often neglected or only half done; by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> means; part of the flour will be condemned for being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> poor, and the rest be above the standard quality. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hoisting of the tail flour, mixing it with bran, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and bolting it over, is attended with so much labour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is seldom done to perfection.</P>

The rubblings that falls at the tail of the sifting reel 39, falls into the hopper of the middlings' reel 42; and the bran falls at the tail into the lower story.

<HEAD>THE Practical Mill-wright. Art. 1. OF UNDERSHOT MILLS.</HEAD>
<P>FIG. 1, plate I, represents an undershot wheel 18 feet diameter, with 3 feet total head and fall. It should be 2 feet wide for every foot the mill-stones are in diameter; that is, 8 feet between the shrouds for a 4 feet, and 10 feet wide for a 5 feet stone. It should have three sets of arms and shrouds, on account of its great width. Its shaft should be at least 26 inches diameter. It requires 12 arms, 18 feet long, 3 1-2 inches thick, by 9 wide; and 24 shrouds 7 1-2 feet long, 10 inches deep, by 3 thick, and 32 floats 15 inches wide. Note, it may be geared the same as an overshot wheel, of equal diameter. Fig. 2 represents the forebay, with its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ills, posts sluice and fall: I have in this case allowed 1 foot fall and 2 feet head.</P>
<P>Fig. 3 represents an undershot wheel 18 feet diameter, with 7 feet head and fall. It should be as wide between the shrouds as the stone is in diameter. Its shaft should be 2 feet diame|ter. Requires 8 arms 18 feet long, 3 1-4 of an

<P>Fig. 4 represents the forebay, sluice, and fall, the head and fall about equal.</P>
<P>Fig. 5 represents an undershot wheel 12 feet diameter, with 15 feet total head and fall. It should be 6 inches wide for every foot the stone is in diameter. Its shaft 20 inches dia|meter. Requires 6 arms 12 feet long, 3 by 8 inches; and 12 shrouds, 6 1-2 feet long, 2 1-2 inches thick, and 8 deep. It suits well to be geared to a 5 feet stone with single gears, 60 cogs in the cog-wheel, and 16 rounds in the trundle; to a 4 1-2 feet stone, with 62 cogs and 15 rounds; and, to a 4 feet stone, with 64 cogs and 14 rounds. These gears will do well till the fall is reduced to 12 feet, only the wheel must be less as the falls are less, so as to make the same number of revolutions in a minute: but this wheel requires more water than a breast mill, with the same fall.</P>
<P>Fig. 6 is the forebay, gate, shute and fall. Forebays should be wide proportionable to the quantity of water they are to convey to the wheels; and should stand 8 or 10 feet in the bank, and be firmly joined, to prevent the wa|ter from breaking through; which it will cer|tainly do, unless they be well secured.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="028644_0366_0FDA2DFE6A839B20">
<HEAD>Art. 2. Directions for making Forebays.</HEAD>
<P>THE best way that I know for making these kind of forebays, is shewn in plate V, fig. 7. Make a number of solid frames, consisting of a fill, two posts, and a cap each; set them cross-wise, (as shewn in the figure) 2 1-2 or 3 feet apart; to these the plank are to be spiked, for there should be no sills lengthwise, as the wa|ter is apt to find its way along them. The frame at the head next the water, and one 6 or 8 feet downwards in the bank, should extend 4 or 5 feet on each side of the forebay in the bank; and be planked in front to prevent the water and vermin from working round. Both of the fills of these long frames should be well secured, by driving down plank edge to edge, like piles, along the upperside, from end to end.</P>
<P>The sills being settled on good foundations, the earth or gravel must be rammed well on all sides, full to the top of the sills. Then lay the bottom with good sound plank, well joint|ed and spiked to the sills. Lay your shute, ex|tending the upper end a little above the point of the gate when full drawn, to guide the wa|ter in a right direction to the wheel. Plank the head to its proper height, minding to leave a suitable sluice, to guide the water smoothly down. Fix the gate in an upright position&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ang and wheel and finish it off ready for let|ting on the water.</P>
<P>A rack must be made to keep off the floating trash that would break the floats and buckets of undershot, breast, and pitch-back wheels,
<PB N="14" REF="028644_0367_0FDA2E0233B80938">
and injure the gates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 2.</NOTE> See it at the head of fore|bay, fig. 7, plate V. This is done by setting a frame 3 feet in front of the forebay, and lay|ing a sill 2 feet in front of it, for the bottom of the rack: in it the staves are put, made of laths, set edgewise with the stream, 2 inches a|part, their upper ends nailed to the cap of the last frame, which causes them to lean down steam. The bottom of the race must be planked between the forebay and rack, to prevent the water from making a hole by tumbling through the rack when choaked; and the sides be planked outside the posts to keep up the banks. This rack must be double as long as the forebay is wide, or else the wa|ter will not come fast enough through it to keep the head up; for the head is the spring of motion of an undershot mill.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Art. 3. Of the Principle of Undershot Mills.</HEAD>
<P>THEY differ from all others in principle, because the water looses all its force by the first stroke against the floats; and the time this force is spending, is in proportion to the difference of the velocities of the wheel and water, and the distance of the floats. Other mills have the weight of the water after the force of the head is spent, and will continue to move; but an undershot will stop as soon as the head is spent, as they depend not on the weight. They should be geared so, that when the stone goes with a proper motion, they will not run too fast with the water, so as not to receive its
<PB N="15" REF="028644_0368_0FDA2E036EFF9208">
force;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 3.</NOTE> nor too slow, so as to loose its power by rebounding and dashing over the buckets. This matter requires very close attention, and has puzzled our mechanical philoso|phers to find it out by theory. They give us for a rule, that the wheel must move just 1-3 the velocity of the water;&mdash;perhaps this may suit where the head is not much higher than the float boards, but I am fully convinced it will not suit high heads.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="experiments">
<HEAD>Experiments for determining the proper Motion for Undershot Wheels.</HEAD>
<P>I drew a full sluice of water on an undershot wheel with 15 feet head and fall, and counted its revolutions per minute; then geared it to a mill-stone, set it to work properly, and again counted its revolutions, and the difference was not more than one fourth slower. I believe, that if I had checked the motion of the wheel to be equal 1-3 the motion of the water, that the water would have rebounded the flew up to the shaft. Hence I conclude, that the moti|on of the water must not be checked by the wheel more than 1-3, nor less than 1-4; else it will loose in power: for although the wheel will carry a greater load with a slow, than swift motion, yet it will not produce so great effect, its motion being too slow. And again, if the motion be too swift, the load or resist|ance it will overcome will be so much less, that its effect will be lessened also. I conclude, that about 2-3 the velocity of the water is the proper motion for undershot wheels, the
<PB N="16" REF="028644_0369_0FDA2E08B7C78A80">
water will then spend all its force in the distance of 2 float boards;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 3.</NOTE> notwithstanding, the learned authors have asserted it to be but 1-3. To confute them, suppose the floats 12 inches, and the column of water striking them, 8 inches deep; then, if 2-3 of the motion of this column be checked, it must instantly be|come 24 inches deep, and rebound against the backs of the floats, and the wheel would be wallowing in this dead water: whereas, when 1-3 of its motion is checked, it becomes only 12 inches deep, and runs off from the wheel smooth and lively.</P>

<HEAD>Art. 7. Of the Motion of Overshot Wheels.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER trying many experiments, I con|cluded that the circumference of overshot wheels geared to mill-stones, grinding to the best advantage, should move 550 feet in a mi|nute; and that of the stones 1375 feet in the same time; that is, while the wheel moves 12, the stone moves 30 inches, in the proportion of 2 to 5.</P>
<P>Then, to find how often the wheel we pro|pose to make will revolve in a minute, take the following steps: 1st, Find the circumference of the wheel by multiplying the diameter by 22, and dividing by 7, thus:</P>
<P>Suppose the diameter to be 16 feet, then 16 multi|plied by 22, produces 352; which, divided by 7, quotes 50 2/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; for the circumference.</P>

<P N="3">3. Lay the first arm with its centre on the centre of the truckle, and take a square notch out of the upper side 3-4 of its depth, wide enough to receive the 2nd arm.</P>
<P N="4">4. Make a square notch in the lower edge of the 2nd arm, 1-4 of its depth, and lay it in the other, and they will joint standing square across other.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lay the 3rd arm just equi-distant be|tween the others, and scribe the lower arms by the side of the upper, and the lower edge of the upper by the sides of the lower arms. Then, take the upper arm off and strike the square scribes, taking out the lower half of the 3rd arm, and the upper half of the lower arms, and fit and lay them together.</P>

<P N="8">8. Circle both edges of the shrouds by the sweep, dress them to width and thickness, lay out the laps 5 inches long, set a gauge to a lit|tle more than 1-3 their thickness, gauge all their ends for the laps from the outsides, cut them all out but the last, that it may be made a little longer, or shorter, as may suit to make the wheel the right diameter; sweep a circle on the arms to lay the shrouds to, while fitting them, put a small draw-pin in the middle of each lap, to draw the joints close, strike a true circle for both inside and outside the shrouds, and one 1 1-2 inch from the inside, where the arms are to be let in.</P>

The ends of the floats must be dovetail|ed a little into the shrouds; when one side is framed, frame the other to fellow it.

In the same manner dress it to 16 square.</P>
<P>To cut it square off to its exact length, stick a peg in the centre of each end, take a long square (that may be made of boards) lay it a|long the corner, the short end against the end of the peg, mark on the square where the shaft is to be cut, and mark the shaft by it at every corner line, from mark to mark; then cut it off to the lines, and it will be truly square.</P>

<P>Hang the spur-wheel and set the stones to grind with a proper motion, and count the re|volutions of the upright shaft in a minute, and compare its revolutions with the revolutions that a bolt should have, which is about 36 revo|lutions a minute. If the upright goes 1-6 more, put 1-6 less in the first driving-wheel than in the leader, suppose 15 in the driver the 18 in the leader: but if their difference be more (fast one half) there must be a difference in the next two wheels; observing, that if the motion of the upright shaft be greater than the bolt should be, then the driving-wheel must be proportion|ably less than the leader; but if it be slower, then the driver must be greater in proportion. The common size of bolting wheels is from 14 to 20 cogs; if less than 14 the head-blocks will be too near the shafts.</P>

3rd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 31</NOTE> Those of a single coat and no screw.</P>
<P>The first kind answers well in some, but not in all cases, because they must turn a certain number of times before the wheat can get out, and the grain has not so good an opportunity of separating, there being nothing to change its position, it floats a considerable way with the same grains uppermost.</P>
<P>The double kind are better because they may be shorter and take up less room; and worse, for being more difficult to be kept clean.</P>
<P>The 3rd kind has this advantage; we can keep the grain in it a longer or shorter time at pleasure, by raising or lowering the tail end, and is also tossed about more; but they must be longer. They are generally 9 or 10 feet, long, 2 feet 4 inches diameter, if to clean for 2 or 3 pair of stones, but if for more, they should be larger accordingly: will clean for from 1 to 6 pair of stones. They are made 6 square, with 6 ribs, which lie flatwise, the outer cor|ners taken off to leave the edge 1-4 of an inch thick; the inner corners so as to bring it near|ly to sharp edges, the wire work nailed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with 14 ounce tacks.</P>
<P>They are generally moved by the same up|right shaft that moves the bolts, by a wheel on its upper end with two sets of cogs: those that strike downwards gearing into a wheel striking upwards that turns a laying shaft, with two pulleys on the other end, one of 24 inches diameter, to turn a fan with quick mo|tion, the other 8 inches, over which passes a strap to a pulley 24 inches diameter, on the gudgeon of the rolling screen, to reduce its motion to about 15 revolutions in a minute.

of the top of the water in the head-race where it is taken out of the stream;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 35.</NOTE> and level from it for the lower side of the race down to the seat of the mill-house, and mark the level of the water in the dam there.</P>
<P N="2">2nd. Begin where the tail-race is to empty into the stream, and level from the top of the water up to the mill-seat, noticing the depth thereof in places as you pass along, which will be of use in digging it out.</P>
<P>Then find the total fall, allowing 1 inch to a rod for fall in the races, but if they are very wide less will do. Then, supposing the fall to be 21 feet 9 inches, which is sufficient for an overshot, mill, and the stream too light for an undershot, consider well what size stone will suit, for I do not recommend a large stone to a weak, nor a small one to a strong stream. I have proposed stones 4 feet diameter for light, and 4,6 for middling, and 5 or 5 feet 6 inches diameter for heavy streams. Suppose you determine on stones 4 feet, then look in table I, (which is for stones of that size) column 2, for the fall that is nearest 21 feet 9 inches, your fall, and you find it in the 7th example. Column 3 contains the head of water over the wheel 3 feet; 4th, the diameter of the wheel 18 feet; 5th, its width, 2 feet 2 inches, &amp;c. for all the proportions to make the stone re|volve 106 times in a minute.</P>
<P>Having determined on the size of the wheels and size of the house, heights of the stories to suit the wheels, and machinery it is to contain, and business to be carried on therein, proceed to draw a ground plan of the house, such as plate VI, which is 32 by 55 feet. See the de|scription

<P>Draw an end view, as plate VIII, and a side view, as plate IX. Take the draught to the ground and stake out the seat of the house. It is commonly best to set that corner of an overshot mill that the water comes in at far|thest in the bank: but take great care to re|consider and examine every thing more than once whether it be planned for the best; be|cause, much labour is often lost for want of due consideration, and by setting buildings in, and laying foundations on wrong places.

The wal|lower commonly has 14 or 15 rounds, but so as to produce the right motion. On the wal|lower shaft is a balance-wheel, which may be of stone or wood: this is to regulate the motion. There should be a good head above the wa|ter-wheel to give it a lively motion, else the mill will run heavily.</P>
<P>The mechanism of a complete saw-mill is such as to produce the following effects, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. To move the saw up and down, with a sufficient motion and power.</P>
<P N="2">2. To move the log to meet the saw with an uniform motion.</P>
<P N="3">3. To stop of itself when within 3 inches of being through the log.</P>
<P N="4">4. To draw the carriage with the log back by the power of water ready to enter again.</P>
<P>The mill is stopped as follows, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> When the gate is drawn the lever is held by a catch, and there is a trigger, one end of which is within half an inch of the side of the carriage, on which is a piece of wood an inch and a half thick nailed, so that it will catch against the trigger as the carriage moves, which throws the catch off of the lever of the gate, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uts down at a proper time.</P>

It is 8 feet long, 3 inches square, tenoned into a roller 6 inches diameter, reach|ing from plate to plate, and working on gud|geons in them; in its lower side is framed a block 10 inches long, with a mortise in it 2 inches wide its whole length to receive the up|per end of the hand-pole, having in it seve|ral holes for an iron pin, to join the hand-pole to it to regulate the feed, by setting the hand|pole nearer the centre of the roller to give less, and farther off, to give more feed.</P>
<P>Fig. 3, The hand-pole or feeder, 12 feet long, and 3 inches square where it joins the block</P>
<P>Fig. 4, tapering to 2 inches at the lower end, on which is the iron hand 1 foot long, with a socket, the end of which is flattened steel|ed and hardened, and turned down at each side half an inch to keep it on the rag-wheel.</P>
<P>Fig. 5, the rag-wheel. This has four cants 4&frac12; feet long, 17 by 3 inches in the middle, lapped together to make the wheel 5 feet di|ameter, is faced between the arms with 2 inch plank, to strengthen the laps. The cramp or ratchet-iron is put on as a hoop near 1 inch square, with ratchet-notches cut on its outer edge, about 3 to an inch. On one side of the
<PB N="81" REF="028644_0434_0FDA2F801E9A51F0">
wheel are put 12 strong pins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 39.</NOTE> 9 inches long, to tread the carriage back, when the backing works are out of order. On the other side are the cogs, about 56 in number, 3 inch pitch to gear into the cog-wheel on the top of the tub-wheel shaft, with 15 or 16 cogs. In the shaft of the rag-wheel are 6 or 7 rounds, 11 inches long in the round part, let in near their whole thickness, so as to be of a pitch equal to the pitch of the cogs of the carriage, and gear into them easily: the ends are tapered off outside and a band drove on them at each end, to keep them in their places.</P>
<P>Fig. 6 the carriage. Is a frame 4 feet wide from outsides, one side 29 feet long, 7 by 7 inches; the other 32 feet long, 8 by 7 inches, very straight and true, the interties at each end 15 by 4 inches, strongly tenoned and braced into the sides to keep the frame from racking. In the under side of the largest piece are set two rows of cogs, 2 inches between the rows, and 9 inches from the fore side of one cog to that of another; the cogs of one row between those of the other, so as to make 4&frac12; inch pitch, to gear into the rounds of the rag-wheel. The cogs are about 66 in number; shank 7 inches long, 1&frac34; inch square; head 2&frac34; long, 2 inches thick at the points, and 2&frac14; inches at the shoul|der.</P>
<P>Fig. 7 the ways for the carriage to run on. These are strips of plank 4&frac12; inches wide, 2 inch|es thick, set on edge, let 1&frac12; inch into the top of the cross sills, of the whole length of the mill, keyed fast on one side, made very straight both side and edge, so that one of them will pass easily between the rows of cogs in the car|riage,

and leave no room for it to move side ways.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 39.</NOTE> They should be of hard wood well seasoned, and hollowed out between the sills to keep the dust from lodging on them.</P>
<P>Fig. 8, the fender posts. The gate with the saw plays in rabbits, 2&frac12; deep and 4 inches wide, in the fender posts, which are 12 feet long, and 12 inches square, hung by hooked tenons, the front side of the two large cross beams in the middle of the frame, in mortises in their upper sides, so that they can be moved by keys to set them plum. There are 3 mor|tises two inches square through each post, within half an inch of the rabbits, through which pass hooks with large heads, to keep the frame in the rabbits: they are keyed at the back of the posts.</P>
<P>Fig. 9, the saw, which is 6 feet long, 7 or 8 inches wide when new, hung in a frame 6 feet wide from the outsides, 6 feet 3 inches long between the end pieces, the lowermost of which is 14 by 3 inches, the upper one 12 by 3, the side pieces 5 by 3 inches, 10 feet long, all of the best, dry, hard wood. The saw is fastened in the frame by two irons in form of staples, the lower one with two screw pins passing through the lower end, screwing one leg to each side of the end piece; the legs of the upper one are made into screws, one at each side of the end piece, passing thro' a broad flat bar that rests on the top of the end piece, with strong burs 1&frac34; inches square, to be turned by an iron span made to fit them. These straps are made of flat bars, 3 feet 9 inches long, 3 inches wide, &frac34; thick before turned; at the turn they are 5 inches wide,

When it is within 3 inches of being through the log, the cleet C, on the side of the carriage, arrives at a trigger and lets it fly, and the sluice-gate shuts down: the miller in|stantly draws water or the wheel 14, which runs the log gently back, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>In addition to what is said of saw-mills, by Thomas Ellicott, I add the following.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>Of hanging the Saw.</HEAD>
<P>First, set the fender-posts as near plum every way as possible, and the head-blocks on which the log is to lay, level. Put the saw right in the middle of the gate, measuring from the outsides, with the upper teeth about half an inch farther forward than the lower ones; set it by the gate and not by a plumline&mdash;this is to give the saw liberty to rise without cut|ting, and the log room to push forward as it rises. Run the carriage forward, so that the saw strike the block&mdash;stick up a nail, &amp;c. there&mdash;run it back again its full length, and, standing behind the saw, set it to direct exactly to the mark. Stretch the saw in the frame rather most at the edge, that it may be stiffest there. Set it to go, and hold a tool close to one side, and observe whether it touch equally the whole length of the stroke&mdash;try if it be square with the top of the head-blocks, else it will not make the scantling square.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>Of whetting the Saw.</HEAD>
<P>The edge of the teeth ought to be kept straight, and not suffered to wear hollowing&mdash;the teeth set a little out, equal at each side, and the outer corners a little longest&mdash;they will clear their way the better. Some whet the under side of the teeth nearly level, and others a little drooping down; but then it will never saw steady&mdash;will be apt to wood too much;&mdash;they should slope a little up, but very little, to make it work steady. Try a cut through the log, and if it comes out at the mark made to set it by, shews it to be right hung.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>Of Springing Logs Straight.</HEAD>
<P>Some long small logs will spring so much in sawing as to spoil the scantling, unless it can be held straight: to do which make a clamp to bear with one end against the side of the car|riage, the other end under the log with a post up the side thereof&mdash;drive a wedge between the post and log, and spring it straight; this will bend the carriage side&mdash;but no matter&mdash;it is no injury.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>Of moving the Logs, to the Size of Scantling, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Make a sliding-block to slide in a rabbet in front of the main head-block: fasten the log to this with a little dog on each side, one end of which being round, is drove into a round hole, in the front side of the sliding block, the other flatted to drive in the log, cutting across the grain, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anting a little out&mdash;it will draw the log tight, and stick in the better. Set a post of hard wood in the middle of the main block close to the sliding one, and to ex|tend with a shoulder over the sliding one, for a wedge to be drove under this shoulder to keep the block tight. Make a mark on each block to measure from&mdash;when the log is mov|ed the key is driven out. The other end next the saw is best held by a sliding dog, part on each side of the saw pointed like a gauge, with two single joint dogs, one on each side of the saw.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>Remedy for a long Pitman.</HEAD>
<P>Make it in two parts by a joint 10 feet from the crank, and a mortise through a fix|ed beam, for the lower end of the upper part to play in, the gate will work more steady, and all may be made lighter.</P>
<P>The feed of a saw-mill ought to be regulated by a screw fixed to move the hand-pole nearer or farther from the centre of the roller that moves it, which may be done as the saw arrives at a knot without stopping the mill.</P>

<P>STEP I. Is to investigate the fundamental principles of the theory, and process of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or manufacture we wish to improve.</P>
<P>II. To consider what is the best plan in theory that can be deduced from, or founded on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> principles to produce the effect we desire.</P>
<P>III. Consider whether the theory is already put in practice to the best advantage, and what are the imperfections or disadvantages of the common process of the art, and whether they can be evaded, and the process improved, and what plans are most likely to succeed.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="example">
<HEAD>EXAMPLE 1. Suppose we take the Art of thrashing Grain,</HEAD>
<P>THEN BY THE RULE&mdash;</P>
<P>STEP I. What are the principles on which this art is founded?&mdash;The grain is contain|ed in a head on the top of the straw, enclosed in a husk or chaff that requires a force to break <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hull, and disengage it; which may be done either on the principle of beating or rubbing.</P>
<P>II. What is the best plan in theory for effecting this?&mdash;As we find that it all requires wear|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> equal force, and is all contained in the head, which is much less in quantity than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;Theory directs the force to be regularly and uniformly applied to the head only, which will require but little power, seeing we can rub it out between our hands.</P>
<P>III. How is this theory put in practice, and what are the imperfections and disadvantages of the common process?&mdash;The grain in the straw is laid on a plank floor, and beaten by men, which flails; or on the ground, and tread out by horses. The disadvantages are,</P>
<P N="1">1st. The force is in both cases applied equally to the straw as well as the head.</P>

<P N="3">3rd. In treading by horses, the grain as well as the straw gets dirty.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Thrashing by men is both expensive and tedious.&mdash;Now cannot improvements be made to overcome all these disadvantages? Such speculations have produced several.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="028644_0445_0FDA2E63B2F885E0">
First, a machine on the principles of a coffee mill, which requires very little force to rule the grain out of the heads, which are first separated from the straw by means of a machine on the principle of a comb, cutting them off. A machine to reap the heads without the straw is wanted to complete this theory. For a description, see American Encyclopedia.</P>
<P>Second, a machine, invented, and put in practice by Coln. Alexander Anderson of Phi|ladelphia; the principles of which is to apply the strength of horses to strike the straw regularly with a uniform force, which finishes as it goes, and cleans the grain at the same time.</P>
<P>A cylinder 4 feet long, and 3 feet 6 inches diameter, with eight bats fastened to its cir|cumference parallel to its axis, and of its whole length, is made to revolve with great rapidity; the bats strike the straw at every fourth of an inch, it being drawn into the ma|chine by and between two rollers that move slowly. This machine makes great dispatch, but is expensive.</P>
<P>Others, attending to the principle of treading, have made a thing in the form of the frus|trum of a cone or sugar-loaf, set full of cogs, to act as the horses feet. This is drawn by horses round a circular floor adapted to it, on which the grain is laid&mdash;the centre of the circle being the vertex of the cone. This having considerable weight and many cogs, a horse will beat out much more with it than with his feet, because it will strike a great ma|ny more strokes with equal force. It has these advantages: it can be made by any ordi|nary carpenter&mdash;is cheap&mdash;and the dirt is not mixed with the grain, straw, &amp;c.</P>

</LIST>
<P>THE machine, to be worked by two men, was made on a scale of a 12 foot flail, having a spring which required a power of 20lb. to raise it three feet high at the point:&mdash;A spring of this power, and raised three feet high, being found to get out wheat with great effect.</P>
<P>The catches or teeth are strongly mortised into the wallower-shaft, and placed round in its circumference, so as to make an angle one with another, of 30 deg. These catches or teeth, take the lifters which raise the flails in an alternate manner, that is, three of the flails are operated upon with the whole power (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 20 lb.) and are on the point of striking; three of them are two thirds raised; three of them one third raised; and three of them at rest; consequently the whole weight to be overcome is 120lb.</P>
<P>The lifters should be placed so as that a perpendicular from their lifting end be at the middle of the flail; the rope should be fixed to the flail somewhat farther advanced to the end of the flail, that a proper tangent may be obtained: the ends of the lifters, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> teeth in the wallower, should be rounded off to form a tangent with each other.</P>
<P>The rope should be fixed to the flail with a hook and eye, to take off when not at work; for some of the flails being always in a lifting state, their elasticity would otherwise injure.</P>
<P>The greater the length of the flails, and the higher they are raised, the more powerful they become; they act upon the floor, with effect, about one third of their length; consequently, a flail 24 feet long will act on the floor, eight feet with force; and this in the size of flails. I would recommend in a horse machine.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="028644_0446_0FDA2E6C63D2EDD0">
I have made the flails of white-oak and hickory poles; the elasticity wanted was obtain|ed by paring away the upper part of the flail, from where the string is fastened to the end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in the mortise: in this way the strength of the spring, and consequently the weight to be overcome, can easily be obtained according to the intended size of the machine. I had flails made with steel springs; the poles do better, and can easily be renewed whenever they are wanted.</P>
<P>The wicker-work having some elasticity, adds to the ease in thrashing. As most kinds of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot be got out with flails, unless frequently turned, this becomes necessary here, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> take up no more time than in the common way of hand-thrashing.</P>
<P>When necessary to turn the grain; or remove the straw; the end of the flails can readily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the floor, and suspended by a small cord from above, to each flail.</P>
<P>The fan or screen is intended for the horse-machine only.</P>
<P>The wallower or wheel should have 15 revolutions in a minute; there being four catches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in its circumference, causes 60 strokes of each flail in a minute, the flail operating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a length of four feet on the grain. A man thrashing in the usual manner, cannot make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than 40 strokes in a minute; with a three foot flail; consequently this hand-machine, with twelve flails, by a combination of velocity and space, is equal to 24 men thrashing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">posing the stroke of the flails equally powerful. In a large machine, worked by a horse having 24 flails, of 24 feet in length, the execution will be much greater.</P>
<P>The application of a horse requires only an upright shaft; horizontal wheel, and trundle had fixed to the wallower; the horse going at the rate of 3600 yards in an hour; this is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> motion to the horse; he can work a whole day at this speed; the frequent stops to re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ve the straw will also give him rest: the trundle-head can be easily proportioned to give he wallower-wheel 15 revolutions in a minute.</P>
<P>If applied to water, the power and execution of this machine may be raised to a wonder|ful degree.</P>
<P>This machine can be put up in any barn already erected, the wheel and horse path co|vered with a slight shade on the outside of the barn.</P>
<P>It is simple in all its parts, can be made by any country carpenter, and not apt to get out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> order: the cost of an hand machine will not exceed 50, and of a horse one 100 dollars. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">THILL.

<HEAD>EXAMPLE II. Take the Art of cleaning Grain by Wind.</HEAD>
<P>BY THE RULE&mdash;</P>
<P>STEP I. What are the principles on which the art is founded?&mdash;Bodies falling through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing mediums, their velocities are as their specific gravities; consequently the farther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fall the greater will be their distance: On this principle a separation can be effected.</P>
<P>II. What is the best plan in theory?&mdash;First, make a current of air for the grain to fall through, as deep as possible; then the lightest will be carried farthest, and the separation be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> complete at the end of the fall. Secondly, cause the grain with the chaff, &amp;c. to fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a narrow line across the current, that the light parts may meet no obstruction from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in being carried forward.

Fourthly, cause the same blast to blow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> grain several times, and thereby effect a complete separation at one operation.</P>
<P>III.

<HEAD>EXAMPLE III. Take the Art of Distillation.</HEAD>
<P>STEP I. The principles on which this art is founded are, evaporation and condensa|tion. The liquid being heated, the spirits it contains being most oily and lightest, evapo|rates first into steam, which being condensed again into a liquid, by cold, is the spirits.</P>
<P>II. The best plan in theory for effecting this, appears as follows: the fire should be ap|plied to the still so as to spend the greatest part of its heat possible, to heat the liquid. Se|condly, the steam should be conveyed into a metal vessel of any form that may suit best; which is to be immersed in cold water, to condense the steam; and in order to keep the con|denser cold, there should be a stream of water continually entering the bottom and flowing over the top of the condensing tub, the steam should have no free passage out of the conden|ser, else the strongest part of the liquor may escape.</P>
<P>III. Is this theory already put in practice, and what are the disadvantages of the com|mon process?&mdash;1st. Greatest part of the heat escapes up the chimney. 2nd. It is almost im|possible to keep the grounds from burning in the still. 3rdly. The fire cannot be regulated to keep the still from boiling over; therefore we are obliged to run slow: to remedy these disadvantages&mdash;First, to lessen the fuel, apply the fire as much to the surface of the still as possible. Enclose the fire by a wall of clay that will not convey the heat away so fast as stone or iron; let in as little air as possibly can be made to keep the fire burning; for the air carries away the heat of the fire. Secondly, to keep the grounds from burning; immerse the still with the liquor into a vessel of water, joining their tops together, then by applying the fire to heat the water in the outside vessel the grounds will not burn, and by regulating the heat of the outside vessel the still may be kept from boiling over.</P>
<P>IV. A still of this structure was made by Col. Alexander Anderson, of Philadelphia, and the experiment tried; but the water in the outside vessel boiled, and being open, the heat escaped thereby, and the liquor in the still could not be made to boil&mdash;this appeared to de|feat the scheme. But considering that by enclosing the water in a tight vessel, so that the steam could not escape, and that by compressure the heat might be increased, and it passed to the liquor in the still, which now boiled as well as if the fire had been immediately ap|plied to the still. Again, by fixing a valve to be loaded so as to let the steam escape, when arrived to such a degree of heat as to be near boiling over, then the still could not be made to boil over at all.</P>
<P>Thus was an improvement produced by which he can dispatch business in the ratio of 2 to 1, expending fuel in the ratio of 2 to 2 1-2, to produce equal quantities of liquor.&mdash;We may bring forward another improvement by considering, that, as we know by experi|ence that compressure above the weight of the atmosphere, keeps the steam from rising from the water, till heated to a certain degree above the boiling heat. We may hence conclude that a compressure less than the atmosphere, will suffer it to rise with a degree less than boiling heat, which suggests the expediency of taking off the pressure of the at|mosphere from the liquor in the still, by which means we shall expend less fuel, and the heat need never be so great as to burn the grounds, which may be done by putting the end of the worm into a tight globular vessel of metal, and a cock between it and the condenser; then inject steam from a small boiler, and expel all the air out of this vessel; turn the cock and it will run into the condenser and be condensed. By repeating this a vacuum may be easily made, and kept up in the worm and top of the still, and the spirits will probably come off with half the heat and fuel usually expended.</P>
<P>This is about to be put in practice to try the experiment.</P>

<HEAD>EXAMPLE IV. Take the Art of venting Smoke from Rooms by Chimneys.</HEAD>
<P>STEP I. The principles are: Heat, by repelling the particles of air to a greater dis|tance, being lighter than cold, will rise above it, forming a current upwards, with a ve|locity proportional to the degree and quantity of heat, and size of the tube or funnel of the chimney, through which it ascends, and with a power proportional to its perpendicular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ght, which power to asc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd will always be equal to the difference of the weight of a co|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of rarified air of the size of the smallest part of the chimney, and a column of com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> air of equal size and height.</P>
<P>II. What is the best plan in theory for venting smoke, that can be founded on these principles?</P>
<P N="1">1st. The size of the chimney must be proportioned to the size and closeness of the room and size of the fire; because, if the chimney be immensely large and the fire small, there will be no current upwards. And again, if the fire be large, and the chimney too small, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> smoke cannot be all vented by it, more air being necessary to supply the fire than can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vent up the chimney, it must spread in the room again, which, after passing through the fire and being burnt is suffocating.</P>
<P N="2">2nd. The narrowest place in the chimney must be next the fire, and in front of it, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the smoke would have to pass under it to get into the room: the current will there be greatest, and will draw up the smoke briskly.</P>
<P N="3">3rd. The chimney must be perfectly tight, so as to admit no air but at the bottom.</P>
<P>III. The errors in chimneys in common practice are,</P>
<P N="1">1st. In making them widest at bottom.</P>
<P N="2">2nd. Too large for the size and closeness of the room.</P>
<P N="3">3rd. In not building them high enough above the wind whirling over the tops of houses, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> blow down them.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The cures directed by the principles and theory are,</P>
<P N="1">1st. If the chimney smoke on account of being too large for the size and closeness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, open a door or window, and make a large fire.

<P N="2">2nd. If it be small at the top and large at the bottom, there is no cure but to lessen it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the bottom.</P>
<P N="3">3rd.

<P N="1">1st. The fire rarifies the air in the room, which gives us the sensation of heat or warmth.</P>

<P>II. Considering these principles, what is the best plan in theory for warming rooms?</P>
<P N="1">1st. We must contrive to apply the fire to spend all its heat, to warm the air as it comes in the room.</P>

wood, even the spars and masts may be cut up for this purpose in desperate cases, which will fill the hold with air and light matter, and as soon as the water inside is level with that outside no more will enter. If every hogshead buoy up 875lb. they will be a great help to buoy up the ship (but care must be taken not to put the empty casks too low, which would overset the ship) and she will float, although half her bottom be torn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mariners, for want of this knowledge often leave their ships too soon, taking to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> although the ship is much the safest, and does not sink for a long time after being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;not considering, although the water gain on their pumps at first, they may be able to hold way with it when risen to a certain height in the hold, because the velocity with which it will enter, will be in proportion to the square root of the difference between the level of the water inside and outside&mdash;added to this the fuller the ship, the easier the pumps will work, therefore they ought not to be too soon discouraged.</P>

<HEAD>EXAMPLE VIII. Take the Art of preserving Fruits, Liquors, &amp;c. from Putre|faction and Fermentation.</HEAD>
<P>STEP. 1. What are the principles of putrefaction and fermentation?&mdash;By experiments with the air-pump it has been discovered that apples, cherries, &amp;c. put in a tight vessel, having the air pumped out, will keep their natural fresh bloom for a long time. Again, by repeated experiments it is proved things frozen will neither putrify nor ferment while in that state. Hence we may conclude that air and heat are the principles or moving caus|es of putrefaction and fermentation.</P>
<P>II. What plans in theory are most likely to succeed?&mdash;By removing the causes we may expect to evade the effect.</P>
<P N="1">1. Suppose a cistern in a cellar be made on the side of a hill, and supplied by a spring of cold water running in at the top, that can be drawn off at the bottom at pleasure. If apples &amp;c. be put in tight vessels, and the air pumped out, and beer cyder, &amp;c. be put in this cis|tern, and immersed in water, will they putrify or ferment? May not the experiment suc|ceed in an ice-house, and fruits be conveyed from one country to another in glass or metal vessels made for the purpose, with the air pumped out and hermetically sealed.</P>
<P>In support of this hypothesis, a neighbour of mine told me, he filled a rum hogshead in the fall full of apples at the bung, bunged it tight, and in the spring found them all sound; another, when a boy, buried a hollow gum bee-hive full of apples, trampled the earth tight about them, opened them when the wheat began to ripen, and found them all sound, but leaving them, returned in a day or two, and found them all rotten<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Much contained in this appendix is to be found in different authors; and several things, which I thought had originated with myself, have been treated of by Dr Franklin.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Communication.&mdash;The following Essay on SAW-MILLS, &amp;c. I received from WILLIAM FRENCH, Mill|wright, Burlington county, (New-Jersey) since I con|cluded, and fearing I may not have another opportu|nity, I publish it.</HEAD>
<P>SAW-MILLS have been much improved in this State, for low heads. Mills with two saws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with not more than 7 feet head and fall, have sawed 5 and 6 hundred thousand feet of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, plank and scantling, in one year. If the water be put on the wheel in a proper man|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">, and the wheel of a proper size, (as by the following table) the saw will strike between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and 130 strokes in a minute: See fig. 1 plate XIV. The lower edge of the breast-beam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be 3-4 the height of the wheel, and 1 inch to a foot, slanting up stream, fastened to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ock-posts with screw-bolts, (see post A) circled out to suit the wheel C; the fall D circled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">it the wheel and extended to E, 2 inches above the lower edge of the breast-beam, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, according to the size of the throat or sluice E, with a shuttle or gate sliding on F E, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> against the breast-beam B: then 4 buckets out of 9 will be acted on by the water. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> method of fastening the buckets or floats is, to step them in starts mortised in the shaft&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> G&mdash;9 buckets in a wheel 4 1-2 inches wide, see them numbered 1, 2, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The Pile Engine.</HEAD>
<P>Fig. 3 a simple machine for driving piles in soft bottoms, for setting mill-walls or dams on. It consists of a frame 6 or 7 feet square, of scantling, 4 by 5 inches, with 2 upright posts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> inches apart, 10 or 12 feet high, 3 by 3 inches, braced from top to bottom of the frame, with a cap on top 2 feet long, 6 by 8 inches, with a pullie in its middle for a rope to bend over fastened to a block I, called a tup, which has 2 pieces 4 inches wide between the uprights, with a piece of 2 inch plank <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, 6 inches wide, framed on the ends, so as to slide up and down the upright posts S. This machine is worked by 4 or 6 men, drawing the tup up by the sticks fastened to the end of the rope K, and letting it fall on the pile L: they can strike 30 or 40 strokes by the swing of their arms in a minute.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>Of building Dams on soft Foundations.</HEAD>
<P>The best method is, to lay 3 sills across stream, and frame cross sills in them up and down stream, setting the main mud-sills on round piles, and pile them with 2 inch plank, well joint|ed and drove close together edge to edge, from one to the other end. By taking one corner off of the lower end of the plank will cause it to keep a close joint at bottom, and by driving an iron dog in the mud-sill, and a wooden wedge to keep it close at the top end will hold it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its place when the tup strikes. It is necessary to pile the outside cross sills also in some bot|toms, and to have wings to run 10 or 12 feet into the bank at each side; and the wing-posts 2 or 3 feet higher than the posts of the dam, where the water falls over, planked to the top N N, and filled with dirt to the plate O.</P>
<P>Fig. 4 is a front view of the breast of the tumbling-dam.</P>
<P>Fig. 5 is a side view of the frame of the tumbling-dam, on its piling a b <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and f g h is the end of the mud-sills. The posts k are framed into the main mud-sills with a hook teno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, leaning down stream 6 inches in 7 feet, supported by the braces 11, framed in the cross sills 1; the cross sills I to run 25 feet up and down stream, and be well planked over; and the breast-posts to be planked to the top (see P fig. 4) and filled with dirt on the upper side within 12 or 18 inches of the plate O: (see Q fig. 5) slanting to cover the up stream ends of the sills 3 or 4 feet deep. R represents the water.</P>
<P>When the heads are high it is best to plank the braces for the water to run down, but if low, it may fall perpendicularly on the sheeting.</P>

<P>WHEREAS Robert Dawson hath established in Wilming|ton a manufactory of bolting cloths, and being desirous to have them recommended to the public, has submitted to our examination some of each kind, (they also having been tried by several millers at this place.) We who are subscribers are wil|ling to certify that those we have had experience of, or have seen tried, have answered well all the purposes of imported cloths; and as the silk, as well as manufacture, is of our own country, it is our opinion that they ought to obtain a decided preference to those fabricated in any foreign country.</P>
