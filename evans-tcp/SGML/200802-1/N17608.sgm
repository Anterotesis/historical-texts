<BIBL>PSALM cxxii, 2d, and following ver&s;es.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Our feet &s;hall &s;tand within thy gates, O Jeru&s;alem, whither the tribes go up; the tribes of the Lord unto the te&s;timony of I&s;rael. To give thanks to the name of the Lord, for there &s;it the thrones of judgment; the throne of the Hou&s;e of David. Pray for the peace of</HI> JERUSALEM. <HI>They &s;hall pro&s;per that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and pro&s;perity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions &s;ake I will now &s;ay, peace be within thee. Becau&s;e of the Hou&s;e of the Lord our God, I will &s;eek thy good.</HI></Q>

<P>IN the&s;e words the P&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es, in &s;trong and beautiful language, his love of his country, and the rea&s;ons on which he founded it; and my pre&s;ent de&s;ign is, to take occa&s;ion from them to explain the duty we owe to our country, and the nature, foundation, and
<PB N="6" REF="022814_0004_0FBA67656A128200">
proper expre&s;&s;ions of that love to it which we ought to cultivate.</P>
<P>I RECKON this a &s;ubject particularly &s;uitable to the &s;ervices of this day, and to the Anni|ver&s;ary of our deliverance at the Revolution from the dangers of popery and arbitrary power; and &s;hould I, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, be led to touch more on political &s;ubjects than would at any other time be proper in the pulpit, you will, I doubt not, excu&s;e me.</P>
<P>THE love of our country has, in all times, been a &s;ubject of warm commendations; and it is certainly a noble pa&s;&s;ion; but, like all other pa&s;&s;ions, it requires regulation and direction. There are mi&s;takes and prejudices by which, in this in&s;tance, we are in particular danger of being mi&s;led.&mdash;I will briefly mention &s;ome of the&s;e to you, and ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>FIRST, That by our country is meant, in this ca&s;e, not the &s;oil, or the &s;pot of earth on which we happen to have been born; not the fore&s;ts and fields, but that community of which we are members; or that body of companions and friends and kindred who are a&s;&s;ociated with us
<PB N="7" REF="022814_0005_0FBA676AB0A34370">
under the &s;ame con&s;titution of government, pro|tected by the &s;ame laws, and bound together by the &s;ame civil polity.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, It is proper to ob&s;erve, that even in this &s;en&s;e of our country, that love of it which is our duty, does not imply any conviction of the &s;uperior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and con&s;titution of government. Were this implied, the love of their country would be the duty of only a very &s;mall part of mankind; for there are few countries that enjoy the advantage of laws and governments which de&s;erve to be preferred. To found, therefore, this duty on &s;uch a preference, would be to found it on error and delu&s;ion.&mdash;It is however a common delu&s;ion.&mdash;There is the &s;ame partiality in countries, to them&s;elves, that there is in individuals. All our attachments &s;hould be accompanied, as far as po&s;&s;ible, with right opinions.&mdash;We are too apt to confine wi&s;dom and virtue within the circle of our own acquaintance and party. Our friends, our country, and, in &s;hort, every thing related to us, we are di&s;po&s;ed to overvalue. A wi&s;e man
<PB N="8" REF="022814_0006_0FBA676DA5166280">
will guard him&s;elf again&s;t this delu&s;ion. He will &s;tudy to think of all things as they are, and not &s;uffer any partial affections to blind his un|der&s;tanding. In other families there may be as much worth as in our own. In other circles of friends there may be as much wi&s;dom; and in other countries as much of all that de&s;erves e&s;|teem; but, notwith&s;tanding this, our obligation to love our own families, friends, and country, and to &s;eek, in the fir&s;t place, their good, will remain the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, It is proper I &s;hould de&s;ire you particularly to di&s;tingui&s;h between the love of our country and that &s;pirit of rival&s;hip and am|bition which has been common among nations.&mdash;What has the love of their country hitherto been among mankind? What has it been but a love of domination; a de&s;ire of conque&s;t, and a thir&s;t for grandeur and glory, by extending ter|ritory, and en&s;laving &s;urrounding countries? What has it been but a blind and narrow prin|ciple, producing in every country a contempt of other countries, and forming men into com|binations and factions again&s;t their common
<PB N="9" REF="022814_0007_0FBA676F40BF73B8">
rights and liberties? This is the principle that has been too often cried up as a virtue of the fir&s;t rank: a principle of the &s;ame kind with that which governs clans of <HI>Indians,</HI> or tribes of <HI>Arabs,</HI> and leads them out to plunder and ma&s;|&s;acre. As mo&s;t of the evils which have taken place in private life, and among individuals, have been occa&s;ioned by the de&s;ire of private intere&s;t overcoming the public affections; &s;o mo&s;t of the evils which have taken place among bodies of men have been occa&s;ioned by the de|&s;ire of their own intere&s;t overcoming the princi|ple of univer&s;al benevolence: and leading them to attack one another's territories, to encroach on one another's rights, and to endeavour to build their own advancement on the degradati|on of all within the reach of their power&mdash;What was the love of their country among the <HI>Jews,</HI> but a wretched partiality to them&s;elves, and a proud contempt of all other nations? What was the love of their country among the old <HI>Romans?</HI> We have heard much of it; but I cannot he&s;itate in &s;aying that, however great it appeared in &s;ome of its exertions, it was, in ge|neral, no better than a principle holding toge|ther a band of robbers in their attempts to cru&s;h all liberty but their own. What is now the love
<PB N="10" REF="022814_0008_0FBA6770ABFA54D0">
of his country in a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> a <HI>Turk,</HI> or a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian?</HI> Can it be con&s;idered as any thing better than a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;lavery, or a blind attachment to a &s;pot where he enjoys no rights, and is di&s;po&s;ed of as if he was a bea&s;t?</P>
<P>LET us learn by &s;uch reflections to correct and purify this pa&s;&s;ion, and to make it a ju&s;t and rational principle of action.</P>
<P>IT is very remarkable that the founder of our religion has not once mentioned this duty, or given us any recommendation of it; and this has, by unbelievers, been made an objection to Chri&s;tianity. What I have &s;aid will entirely remove this objection. Certain it is, that, by inculcating on men an attachment to their coun|try, Chri&s;tianity would, at the time it was pro|pagated, have done un&s;peakably more harm than good. Among the <HI>Jews,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> would have been an excitement to war and in&s;urrections; for they were then in eager expectation of be|coming &s;oon (as the favourite people of Hea|ven) the lords and conquerors of the earth, un|der the triumphant reign of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> Among the <HI>Romans,</HI> likewi&s;e, this principle had, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, exceeded its ju&s;t bounds, and rendered them enemies to the peace and happi|ne&s;s of mankind. By inculcating it, therefore,
<PB N="11" REF="022814_0009_0FBA6772400AAE60">
Chri&s;tianity would have confirmed both Jews and Gentiles in one of the mo&s;t pernicious faults. Our Lord and his Apo&s;tles have done better. They have recommended that UNIVERSAL BE|NEVOLENCE which is an un&s;peakably nobler principle than any partial affections. They have laid &s;uch &s;tre&s;s on loving all men, even our ene|mies, and made an ardent and exten&s;ive charity &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of virtue, that the religion they have preached may, by way of di&s;tinction from all other religions, be called the Religion of Benevolence. Nothing can be more friendly to the general rights of mankind; and were it duly regarded and practi&s;ed, every man would con&s;ider every other man as his brother, and all the animo&s;ity that now takes place among con|tending nations would be aboli&s;hed. If you want any proof of this, think of our Saviour's parable of the good Samaritan. The <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans</HI> were two rival nations that enter|tained a hatred of one another the mo&s;t invete|rate. The de&s;ign of this parable was to &s;hew to a <HI>Jew,</HI> that even a <HI>Samaritan,</HI> and con&s;e|quently all men of all nations and religions, were included in the precept, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF.</P>
<P>BUT I am digre&s;&s;ing from what I had chiefly
<PB N="12" REF="022814_0010_0FBA6773B7274728">
in view; which was, after noticing that love of our country which is fal&s;e and &s;purious, to ex|plain the nature and effects of that which is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. With this view. I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to recollect that we are &s;o con&s;tituted that our affections are more drawn to &s;ome among mankind than to others, in proportion to their degrees of nearne&s;s to us, and our power of be|ing u&s;eful to them. It is obvious, that this is a circum&s;tance in the con&s;titution of our natures which proves the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of our Maker; for had our affections been determined alike to all our fellow-creatures, human life would have been a &s;cene of embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;traction. Our regards, according to the or|der of nature, begin with our&s;elves; and every man is charged primarily with the care of him|&s;elf. Next come our families, and benefactors, and friends; and after them, our country. We can do little for the intere&s;t of mankind at large. To this intere&s;t, however, all other intere&s;ts are &s;ubordinate. The noble&s;t principle in our na|ture is the regard to general ju&s;tice, and that good-will which embraces all the world.&mdash;I have already ob&s;erved this; but it cannot be too often repeated. Though our immediate attention mu&s;t be employed in promoting our
<PB N="13" REF="022814_0011_0FBA67754320B860">
own intere&s;t and that of our neare&s;t connexions; yet we mu&s;t remember, that a narrower intere&s;t ought always to give way to a more exten&s;ive intere&s;t. In pur&s;uing particularly the intere&s;t of our country, we ought to carry our views be|yond it. We &s;hould love it ardently, but not exclu&s;ively. We ought to &s;eek its good, by all the means that our different circum&s;tances and abilities will allow; but, at the &s;ame time, we ought to con&s;ider our&s;elves as citizens of the world, and take care to maintain a ju&s;t regard to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rights of other countries.</P>
<P>THE enquiry by what means (&s;ubject to this limitation) we may be&s;t promote the intere&s;t of our country, is very important; and all that re|mains of this di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall be employed in an|&s;wering it, and in exhorting you to manife&s;t your love to your country, by the means I &s;hall mention.</P>
<P>THE chief ble&s;&s;ings of human nature are the three following:&mdash;TRUTH&mdash;VIRTUE&mdash;and LIBERTY.&mdash;The&s;e are, therefore, the ble&s;&s;ings in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which the intere&s;t of our country lies, and to the attainment of which our love of it ought to direct our endeavours. By the diffu&s;ion of KNOWLEDGE it mu&s;t be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from a country of <HI>Barbarians:</HI> by the
<PB N="14" REF="022814_0012_0FBA6777242E63E0">
practice of religious VIRTUE, it mu&s;t be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from a country of <HI>gamblers, Athei&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>libertines:</HI> and by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of LIBERTY, it mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a country of <HI>&s;laves.</HI>&mdash;I will dwell for a few moments on each of the&s;e heads:</P>
<P>OUR fir&s;t concern, as lovers of our country, mu&s;t be to <HI>enlighten</HI> it.&mdash;Why are the nations of the world &s;o patient under de&s;poti&s;m?&mdash;Why do they crouch to tyrants, and &s;ubmit to be treated as if they were a herd of cattle? Is it not becau&s;e they are kept in darkne&s;s, and want knowledge? Enlighten them and you will elevate them. Shew them they are <HI>men,</HI> and they will act like <HI>men.</HI> Give them ju&s;t ideas of civil government, and let them know that it is an expedient for gaining protection again&s;t injury and defending their rights, and it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;ubmit to governments which, like mo&s;t of tho&s;e now in the world, are u&s;urpations on the rights of men, and little better than con|trivances for enabling the <HI>few</HI> to oppre&s;s the <HI>many.</HI> Convince them that the Deity is a righ|teous and benevolent as well as omnipotent Being, who regards with equal eye all his crea|tures, and connects his favour with nothing but an hone&s;t de&s;ire to know and do his will; and
<PB N="15" REF="022814_0013_0FBA677C17983110">
that zeal for my&s;tical doctrines which has led men to hate and hara&s;s one another, will be ex|terminated. Set religion before them as a ra|tional &s;ervice, con&s;i&s;ting not in any rites and ce|remonies, but in wor&s;hipping God with a pure heart, and practi&s;ing righteou&s;ne&s;s from the fear of his di&s;plea&s;ure and the apprehen&s;ion of a fu|ture righteous judgment, and that gloomy and cruel &s;uper&s;tition will be aboli&s;hed, which has hitherto gone under the name of religion, and to the &s;upport of which civil government has been perverted.&mdash;Ignorance is the parent of bigotry, intolerance, per&s;ecution and &s;lavery.&mdash;Inform and in&s;truct mankind, and the&s;e evils will be excluded.&mdash;Happy is the per&s;on who, him&s;elf rai&s;ed above vulgar errors, is con&s;cious of having aimed at giving mankind this in|&s;truction. Happy is the Scholar or Philo&s;o|pher who at the clo&s;e of life can reflect that he has made this u&s;e of his learning and abilities: but happier far mu&s;t he be, if at the &s;ame time he has rea&s;on to believe he has been &s;ucce&s;sful, and actually contributed, by his in&s;tructions, to di&s;&s;eminate among his fellow-creatures ju&s;t no|tions of them&s;elves, of their rights, of religion, and the nature and end of civil government. Such were <HI>Milton, Locke, Sidney, Hoadly,</HI> &amp;c. in
<PB N="16" REF="022814_0014_0FBA677FE8DF7870">
this country; &s;uch were <HI>Monte&s;quieu, Fenelon, Turgot,</HI> &amp;c. in France. They &s;owed a &s;eed which has &s;ince taken root, and is now growing up to a glorious harve&s;t. To the information they conveyed by their writings we owe tho&s;e revolutions in which every friend to mankind is now exulting.&mdash;What an encouragement is this to us all in our endeavours to enlighten the world? Every degree of illumination which we can communicate mu&s;t do the greate&s;t good. It helps to prepare the minds of men for the re|covery of their rights, and ha&s;tens the overthrow of prie&s;tcraft and tyranny.&mdash;In &s;hort, we may, in this in&s;tance, learn, our duty from the conduct of the oppre&s;&s;ors of the world. They know that light is ho&s;tile to them, and therefore they la|bour to keep men in the dark. With this in|tention they have appointed licen&s;ers of the pre&s;s; and, in Popi&s;h countries, prohibited the reading of the Bible. Remove the darkne&s;s in which they envelope the world, and their u&s;urp|ations will be expo&s;ed, their power will be &s;ub|verted, and the world emancipated.</P>
<P>THE next great ble&s;&s;ing of human nature which I have mentioned, is VIRTUE. This ought to follow knowledge, and to be directed by it. Virtue without knowledge makes en|thu&s;ia&s;ts;
<PB N="17" REF="022814_0015_0FBA678136ABFCA8">
and knowledge without virtue makes devils; but both united elevates to the top of human dignity and perfection.&mdash;We mu&s;t, there|fore, if we would &s;erve our country, make both the&s;e the objects of our zeal. We mu&s;t di&s;courage vice in all its forms; and our endeavours to en|lighten mu&s;t have ultimately in view a reformation of manners and virtuous practice.</P>
<P>I MUST add here, that in the practice of virtue I include the di&s;charge of the public duties of reli|gion. By neglecting the&s;e, we may injure our country e&s;&s;entially. But it is melancholy to ob|&s;erve that it is a common neglect among us; and in a great mea&s;ure owing to a cau&s;e which is not likely to be &s;oon removed: I mean, the defects (may I not &s;ay, the ab&s;urdities?) in our e&s;tabli&s;h|ed codes of faith and wor&s;hip. In foreign coun|tries, the higher ranks of men, not di&s;tingui&s;hing between the religion they &s;ee e&s;tabli&s;hed and the Chri&s;tian religion, are generally driven to irreligi|on and infidelity. The like evil is produced by the like cau&s;e in this country; and if no reforma|tion of our e&s;tabli&s;hed formularies can be brought about, it mu&s;t be expected that religion will go on to lo&s;e its credit, and that little of it will be left except among the lower orders of people, many of whom, while their &s;uperiors give up all religion, are
<PB N="18" REF="022814_0016_0FBA6783CDB97D20">
&s;inking into an enthu&s;ia&s;m in religion lately revived.</P>
<P>I HOPE you will not mi&s;take what I am now &s;ay|ing, or con&s;ider it as the effect of my prejudices as a Di&s;&s;enter from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. The com|plaint I am making, is the complaint of many of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church it&s;elf, who have been long urging the nece&s;&s;ity of a revi&s;al of its Liturgy and Articles. The&s;e were framed above two centuries ago, when Chri&s;tendom was ju&s;t emerging from the ignorance and barba|rity of the dark ages. They remain now much the &s;ame they were then; and, therefore, cannot be properly adapted to the good &s;en&s;e and liberality of the pre&s;ent times.&mdash;This imperfection, however, in our public forms of wor&s;hip, affords no excu&s;e to any per&s;on for neglecting public wor&s;hip. All communities will have &s;ome religion; and it is of infinite con&s;equence that they &s;hould be led to that which, by enforcing the obligations of virtue and putting men upon loving in&s;tead of damning one another, is mo&s;t favourable to the intere&s;t of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IF there is a Governor of the world, who directs all events, he ought to be invoked and wor&s;hip|ped; and tho&s;e who di&s;like that mode of wor&s;hip which is pre&s;cribed by public authority, ought (if they can find no wor&s;hip <HI>out</HI> of the church which they approve) to &s;et up a &s;eparate wor&s;hip for them|&s;elves;
<PB N="19" REF="022814_0017_0FBA678516FE3B00">
and by doing this, and giving an example of a rational and manly wor&s;hip, men of weight, from their rank or literature, may do the greate&s;t &s;ervice to &s;ociety and the world. They may bear a te&s;timony again&s;t that application of civil power to the &s;upport of particular modes of faith, which ob&s;tructs human improvement, and perpetuates error; and they may hold out an in&s;truction which will di&s;countenance &s;uper&s;tition, and at the &s;ame time recommend religion, by making it appear to be (what it certainly is when rightly under&s;tood) the &s;tronge&s;t incentive to all that is generous and worthy, and con&s;equently the be&s;t friend to public order and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>LIBERTY is the next great ble&s;&s;ing which I have mentioned as the object of patriotic zeal. It is in|&s;eparable from knowledge and virtue, and together with them completes the glory of a community. An enlightened and virtuous country mu&s;t be a free country. It cannot &s;uffer inva&s;ions of its rights, or bend to tyrants.&mdash;I need not, on this occa&s;ion, take any pains to &s;hew you how great a ble&s;&s;ing liberty is. The &s;malle&s;t attention to the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t ages, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind, will make you &s;en&s;ible of its importance. Look round the world, and you will find almo&s;t every country, re&s;pectable or contemptible, happy or mi&s;erable,
<PB N="20" REF="022814_0018_0FBA6788A8507328">
a fruitful field or a frightful wa&s;te, according as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es or wants this ble&s;&s;ing. Think of <HI>Greece,</HI> formerly the &s;eat of arts and &s;cience, and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;pot under heaven; but now, having lo&s;t liberty, a vile and wretched &s;pot, a region of darkne&s;s, poverty, and barbarity.&mdash;Such reflections mu&s;t convince you that, if you love your country, you cannot be zealous enough in promoting the cau&s;e of liberty in it. But it will come in my way to &s;ay more to this purpo&s;e pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations I have made include our whole duty to our country; for by endeavouring to lib|eralize and enlighten it, to di&s;courage vice and to promote virtue in it, and to a&s;&s;ert and &s;upport its liberties, we &s;hall endeavour to do all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make it great and happy.&mdash;But it is proper that, on this occa&s;ion, I &s;hould be more explicit, and exemplify our duty to our country by ob&s;erving farther, that it requires us to obey its laws, and to re&s;pect its magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>CIVIL government (as I have before ob&s;erved) is an in&s;titution of human prudence for guarding our per&s;ons, our property, and our good name, again&s;t inva&s;ion; and for &s;ecuring to the members of a community that liberty to which all have an equal right, as far as they do not, by any overt act, u&s;e it to injure the liberty of others. Civil
<PB N="21" REF="022814_0019_0FBA678D1BFAB070">
laws are regulations agreed upon by the commu|nity for gaining the&s;e ends; and civil magi&s;trates are officers appointed by the community for exe|cuting the&s;e laws. Obedience, therefore, to the laws and to magi&s;trates, are nece&s;&s;ary expre&s;&s;ions of our regard to the community; and without this obedience the ends of government cannot be ob|tained, or a community avoid falling into a &s;tate of anarchy that will de&s;troy tho&s;e rights and &s;ub|vert that liberty, which government is in&s;tituted to protect.</P>
<P>I WISH it was in my power to give you a ju&s;t ac|count of the importance of this ob&s;ervation.

improper ideas of their &s;ituation; and it deba&s;es tho&s;e who offer it, by manife&s;ting an abjectne&s;s founded on improper ideas of <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> I have lately ob&s;erved in this kingdom too near approaches to this abjectne&s;s. In our late addre&s;&s;es to the King, on his recovery from the &s;evere illne&s;s with which God has been plea&s;ed to afflict him, we have ap|peared more like a herd crawling at the feet of a ma&s;ter, than like enlightened and manly citizens rejoicing with a beloved Sovereign, but at the &s;ame time con&s;cious that he derives all his con&s;equence from them&s;elves. But, perhaps, the&s;e &s;ervilities in the language of our late addre&s;&s;es &s;hould be pardoned, as only <HI>forms</HI> of civility and expre&s;&s;ions of an overflow of good-nature. They have, how|ever, a dangerous tendency. The potentates of this world are &s;ufficiently apt to con&s;ider them&s;elves as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an inherent &s;uperiority, which gives them a right to govern, and makes mankind <HI>their own;</HI> and this infatuation is almo&s;t every where fo&s;tered in them by the creeping &s;ycophants about them, and the language of flattery which they are continually hearing.</P>
<P>CIVIL governors are properly the &s;ervants of the public; and a King is no more than the fir&s;t &s;ervant of the public, created by it, maintained by it, and re&s;pon&s;ible to it: and all the homage paid him, is
<PB N="23" REF="022814_0021_0FBA6790EF8EE570">
due to him on no other account than his relation to the public. His &s;acredne&s;s is the &s;acredne&s;s of the community. His authority is the authority of the community; and the term Maje&s;ty, which it is u&s;ual to apply to him, is by no means <HI>his own</HI> maje&s;ty, but the MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE. For this rea&s;on, whatever he may be in his private ca|pacity; and though, in re&s;pect of per&s;onal quali|ties, not equal to, or even far below many among our&s;elves&mdash;For this rea&s;on, I &s;ay (that is, as repre|&s;enting the community and its fir&s;t magi&s;trate), he is entitled to our reverence and obedience. The words MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY are rightly ap|plied to him; and there is a re&s;pect which it would be criminal to withhold from him.</P>
<P>You cannot be too attentive to this ob&s;ervation. The improvement of the world depends on the at|tention to it: nor will mankind be ever as virtuous and happy as they are capable of being, till the atten|tion to it becomes univer&s;al and efficacious. If we forget it, we &s;hall be in danger of an idolatry as gro&s;s and &s;tupid as that of the ancient heathens, who, after fabricating blocks of wood or &s;tone, fell down and wor&s;hipped them.&mdash;The di&s;po&s;ition in man|kind to this kind of idolatry is indeed a very mor|tifying &s;ubject of reflection.&mdash;In TURKEY, millions of human beings adore a &s;illy mortal, and are rea|dy

to throw them&s;elves at his feet, and to &s;ubmit their lives to his di&s;cretion.&mdash;In RUSSIA, the com|mon people are only a STOCK on the lands of gran|dees, or appendages to their e&s;tates, which, like the fixtures in a hou&s;e, are bought and &s;old with the e&s;tates.&mdash;In SPAIN, in GERMANY, and under mo&s;t of the governments of the world, mankind are in a &s;imilar &s;tate of humiliation. Who, that has a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the dignity of his nature, can avoid execrating &s;uch a deba&s;ement of it?</P>
<P>HAD I been to addre&s;s the King on a late oc|ca&s;ion, I &s;hould have been inclined to do it in a &s;tyle very different from that of mo&s;t of the addre&s;|&s;ers, and to u&s;e &s;ome &s;uch language as the follow|ing:&mdash;<Q>I rejoice, Sir, in your recovery. I thank God for his goodne&s;s to you.

BUT I mu&s;t not forget the oppo&s;ite extreme to that now taken notice of; that is, a di&s;dainful pride, derived from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of equality, or, perhaps, &s;uperiority, in re&s;pect of all that gives true dignity to men in power, and producing a con|tempt of them, and a di&s;po&s;ition to treat them with rudene&s;s and in&s;ult. It is a trite ob&s;ervation, that extremes generally beget one another. This is particularly true in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Per&s;ons ju&s;tly informed on the &s;ubject of government, when they &s;ee men dazzled by looking up to high &s;tations, and ob&s;erve loyalty carried to a length that implies ig|norance and &s;ervility: &s;uch per&s;ons, in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, are in danger of &s;purning at all public authority, and throwing off that re&s;pectful demean|or to per&s;ons inve&s;ted with it, which the order of &s;ociety requires. There is undoubtedly a particu|lar deference and homage due to civil magi&s;trates, on account of their &s;tations and offices; nor can that man be either truly wi&s;e or truly virtuous, who de&s;pi&s;es governments, and wantonly <HI>&s;peaks evil of his rulers;</HI> or who does not, by all the means in his power, endeavour to &s;trengthen their hands, and to give weight to their exertions in the di&s;charge of their duty.&mdash;<HI>Fear God,</HI> &s;ays St. Peter. <HI>Love the brotherhood.

the penalties annexed to the breach of the laws) <HI>but for con&s;cience &s;ake. For rulers are mini&s;ters of God, and revengers for executing wrath on all that do evil.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER expre&s;&s;ion of our love to our country is defending it again&s;t enemies. The&s;e enemies are of two &s;orts, internal and external; or dome&s;tic and foreign. The former are the mo&s;t dangerous, and they have generally been the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, that there is a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due to the executive officers of government, which is our duty; but you mu&s;t not forget what I have al&s;o ob&s;erved, that it mu&s;t not be a blind and &s;la|vi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Men in power (unle&s;s better di&s;|po&s;ed than is common) are always endeavouring to extend their power. They hate the doctrine, that it is a TRUST derived from the people, and not a <HI>right</HI> ve&s;ted in them&s;elves. For this rea&s;on, the tendency of every government is to de&s;poti&s;m; and in this the be&s;t con&s;tituted governments mu&s;t end, if the people are not vigilant, ready to take alarms, and determined to re&s;i&s;t abu&s;es as &s;oon as they begin. This vigilance, therefore, it is our duty to maintain. Whenever it is withdrawn, and a people cea&s;e to rea&s;on about their rights and to be awake to encroachments, they are in danger of being en&s;laved, and their <HI>&s;ervants</HI> will &s;oon be|come their <HI>ma&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>I NEED not &s;ay how much it is our duty to de|fend
<PB N="27" REF="022814_0025_0FBA67999E846890">
our country again&s;t foreign enemies. When a country is attacked in any of its rights by ano|ther country, or when any attempts are made by ambitious foreign powers to injure it, a war in its defence becomes nece&s;&s;ary: and, in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, to die for our country is meritorious and noble. The&s;e <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> wars are, in my opinion, the only ju&s;t wars. <HI>Offen&s;ive</HI> wars are always un|lawful; and to &s;eek the aggrandizement of our country by them, that is, by attacking other coun|tries, in order to extend dominion, or to gratify avarice, is wicked and dete&s;table. Such, however, have been mo&s;t of the wars which have taken place in the world; but the time is, I hope, coming, when a conviction will prevail, of the folly as well as the iniquity of wars; and when the nations of the earth, happy under ju&s;t governments, and no longer in danger from the pa&s;&s;ions of Kings, will find out better ways of &s;ettling their di&s;putes; and beat (as I&s;aiah prophe&s;ies) <HI>their &s;words into plow|&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the particulars included in that duty to our country, by di&s;charging which we &s;hould &s;hew our love to it, I will only further mention praying for it, and offering up thank&s;givings to God for every event favourable to it. At the pre&s;ent &s;ea|&s;on we are called upon to expre&s;s, in this way, our love to our country. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of this day

<P>WE are met to thank God for that event in this country to which the name of THE REVOLUTION has been given; and which, for more than a cen|tury, it has been u&s;ual for the friends of freedom, and more e&s;pecially Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, under the title of the REVOLUTION SOCIETY, to celebrate with expre&s;&s;ions of joy and exultation.&mdash;My high|ly valued and excellent friend, who addre&s;&s;ed you on this occa&s;ion la&s;t year, has given you an inter|e&s;ting account of the principal circum&s;tances that attended this event, and of the rea&s;ons we have for rejoicing in it. By a bloodle&s;s victory, the fetters which de&s;poti&s;m had been long preparing for us were broken; the rights of the people were a&s;&s;ert|ed, a tyrant expelled, and a Sovereign of our own choice appointed in his room. Security was given to our property, and our con&s;ciences were eman|cipated. The bounds of free enquiry were en|larged; the volume in which are the words of eternal life, was laid more open to our examina|tion; and that <HI>aera</HI> of light and liberty was intro|duced among us, by which we have been made an example to other kingdoms, and became the in|&s;tructors of the world. Had it not been for this deliver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the probability is, that, in&s;tead of be|ing

thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, we &s;hould now have been a ba&s;e people, groaning under the infamy and mi|&s;ery of popery and &s;lavery. Let us therefore, of|fer thank&s;givings to God, the author of all our ble&s;&s;ings. <HI>Had he not been on out &s;ide, we &s;hould have been &s;wallowed up quick, and the proud waters would have gone over our &s;ouls. But our &s;ouls are e&s;caped, and the &s;nare has been broken. Ble&s;&s;ed then be the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</HI> cxxivth P&s;alm.</P>
<P>IT is well known that King James was not far from gaining his purpo&s;e; and that probably he would have &s;ucceeded, had he been le&s;s in a hurry. But he was a fool as well as a bigot. He wanted courage as well as prudence; and, therefore, fled, and left us to &s;ettle quietly for our&s;elves that con|&s;titution of government which is now our boa&s;t. We have particular rea&s;on, as Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, to rejoice on this occa&s;ion. It was at this time we were re&s;cued from per&s;ecution, and obtained the liberty of wor&s;hipping God in the manner we think mo&s;t acceptable to him. It was then our meeting hou&s;es were opened, our wor&s;hip was taken under the protection of the law, and the principles of to|leration gained a triumph. We have, therefore, on this occa&s;ion, peculiar rea&s;ons for thank&s;giving&mdash;But let us remember that we ought not to &s;a|tisfy our&s;elves with thank&s;givings. Our gratitude,
<PB N="30" REF="022814_0028_0FBA67A2E8C3BEC8">
if genuine, will be accompanied with endeavours to give &s;tability to the deliverance our country has obtained, and to extend and improve the happi|ne&s;s with which the Revolution has ble&s;t us&mdash;Let us, in particular, take care not to forget the prin|ciples of the Revolution. This Society has, very properly, in its Reports, held out the&s;e principles, as an in&s;truction to the public. I will only take notice of the three following:</P>
<P>FIRST; The right to liberty of con&s;cience in religious matters.</P>
<P>SECONDLY; The right to re&s;i&s;t power when abu&s;ed. And,</P>
<P>THIRDLY; The right to chu&s;e our own gover|nors; to ca&s;hier them for mi&s;conduct; and to frame a government for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e three principles, and mere e&s;pecially the la&s;t, was the Revolution founded. Were it not true that liberty of con&s;cience is a &s;acred right; that power abu&s;ed ju&s;tifies re&s;i&s;tance; and that civil authority is a delegation from the people&mdash;Were not, I &s;ay, all this true, the Revolution would have been not an ASSERTION, but an INVASION of rights; not a REVOLUTION, but a REBELLION. Cheri&s;h in your brea&s;ts this conviction, and act un|der its influence; dete&s;ting the odious doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, non-re&s;i&s;tance, and the divine right of kings&mdash;doctrines which, had they been
<PB N="31" REF="022814_0029_0FBA67A4684B1FE0">
acted upon in this country, would have left us at this time wretched &s;laves&mdash;doctrines which imply, that God made mankind to be oppre&s;&s;ed and plun|dered; and which are no le&s;s a bla&s;phemy again&s;t him, than an in&s;ult on common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I WOULD farther direct you to remember, that though the Revolution was a great work, it was by no means a perfect work; and that all was not then gained which was nece&s;&s;ary to put the king|dom in the &s;ecure and complete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty.&mdash;In particular, you &s;hould re|collect, that the toleration then obtained was im|perfect. It included only tho&s;e who could declare their faith in the doctrinal articles of the church of England. It has, indeed, been &s;ince extended, but not &s;ufficiently; for there &s;till exi&s;t penal laws on account of religious opinions, which (were they carried into execution) would &s;hut up many of our places of wor&s;hip, and &s;ilence and impri&s;on &s;ome of our able&s;t and be&s;t men.&mdash;The TEST LAWS are al&s;o &s;till in force; and deprive of eligibility to ci|vil and military offices, all who cannot conform to the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip. It is with great plea&s;ure I find that the body of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, though defeated in two late attempts to deliver their coun|try from this di&s;grace to it, have determined to per&s;evere. Should they at la&s;t &s;ucceed, they will have the &s;atisfaction, not only of removing from

them&s;elves a pro&s;cription they do not de&s;erve, but of contributing to le&s;&s;en the number of public ini|quities.

<P><HI>In</HI> 1769 <HI>and</HI> 1772, <HI>the mini&s;ters among the Di&s;&s;enters applied to Parliament for relief from the obligation they were then under to &s;ub&s;cribe the doctrinal articles of the Church of England in order to be entitled to a toleration, and both times &s;ucceeded in the Hou&s;e of Commons, in con&s;equence of Lord</HI> North'<HI>s neutrality, but were defeated in the Hou&s;e of Lords, in con&s;equence of an oppo&s;ition from the Epi&s;copal Bench. They per&s;evered, however; the Bi&s;hops repented; and a third application proved &s;ucce&s;sful in both hou&s;es. In the debate occa&s;ioned in the Hou&s;e of Lords by the</HI> &s;econd <HI>ap|plication, Dr Drummond, the Archbi&s;hop of York, having called the Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters men of clo&s;e ambition, Lord</HI> Chatham <HI>&s;aid, that this was judging uncharitably; and that whoever brought &s;uch a charge again&s;t them, without proof, defamed.

<PB N="34" REF="022814_0032_0FBA67ACB34E1438">
&s;ect &s;tate in which the Revolution left our con&s;ti|tution, is the <HI>inequality of our repre&s;entation.</HI> I think, indeed, this defect in our con&s;titution &s;o gro&s;s and &s;o palpable, as to make it excellent chiefly in form and theory. You &s;hould remember that a repre|&s;entation in the legi&s;lature of a kingdom is the <HI>ba&s;is</HI> of con&s;titutional liberty in it, and of all legitimate government; and that without it a government is nothing but an u&s;urpation. When the repre&s;enta|tion is fair and equal, and at the &s;ame time ve&s;ted with &s;uch powers as our Hou&s;e of Commons po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, a kingdom may be &s;aid to govern it&s;elf, and con&s;equently to po&s;&s;e&s;s true liberty. When the re|pre&s;entation is partial, a kingdom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es liberty only partially; and if extremely partial, it only gives a <HI>&s;emblance</HI> of liberty; but if not only extre|mely partial, but corruptly cho&s;en, and under cor|rupt influence after being cho&s;en, it becomes a <HI>nui&s;|ance,</HI> and produces the wor&s;t of all forms of govern|ment&mdash;a government by corruption, a government carried on and &s;upported by &s;preading venality and profligacy through a kingdom. May heaven pre&s;erve this kingdom from a calamity &s;o dread|ful! It is the point of depravity to which abu&s;es under &s;uch a government as ours naturally tend, and the la&s;t &s;tage of national unhappine&s;s. We are, at pre&s;ent, I hope, at a great di&s;tance from it. But it cannot be pretended that there are no ad|vances towards it, or that there is no rea&s;on for ap|prehen&s;ion and alarm.</P>
<P>The inadequatene&s;s of our repre&s;entation has

At the time of the American war, a&s;&s;ociations were formed for this purpo&s;e in LONDON, and other parts of the king|dom; and our pre&s;ent Mini&s;ter him&s;elf has, &s;ince that war, directed to it an effort which made him a favourite with many of us. But all attention to it &s;eems now lo&s;t, and the probability is, that this inattention will continue, and that nothing will be done towards gaining for us this e&s;&s;ential ble&s;&s;ing, till &s;ome great calamity again alarms our fears, or till &s;ome great abu&s;e of power again provokes our re&s;entment; or, perhaps, till the acqui&s;ition of a pure and equal repre&s;entation by other countries (while we are mocked with the &s;hadow) kindles our &s;hame.</P>
<P>SUCH is the conduct by which we ought to ex|pre&s;s our gratitude for the Revolution.&mdash;We &s;hould always bear in mind the principles that ju&s;tify it. We &s;hould contribute all we can towards &s;upplying what it left deficient; and &s;hew our&s;elves anxious about tran&s;mitting the ble&s;&s;ings obtained by it to our po&s;terity, unimpaired and improved.&mdash;But, brethren, while we thus &s;hew our patriotic zeal, let us take care not to di&s;grace the cau&s;e of patrioti&s;m, by any licentious, or immoral conduct.&mdash;Oh! how earne&s;tly do I wi&s;h that all who profe&s;s zeal in this
<PB N="36" REF="022814_0034_0FBA67AFAF1348E8">
cau&s;e, were as di&s;tingui&s;hed by the purity of their morals, as &s;ome of them are by their abilities; and that I could make them &s;en&s;ible of the advantages they would derive from a virtuous character, and of the &s;u&s;picions they incur and the lo&s;s of con&s;e|quence they &s;uffer by wanting it.&mdash;Oh! that I could &s;ee in men who oppo&s;e tyranny in the &s;tate, a di&s;|dain of the tyranny of low pa&s;&s;ions in them&s;elves; or, at lea&s;t, &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and regard to public order and decency as would induce them to <HI>hide</HI> their irregularities, and to avoid in&s;ulting the virtuous part of the community by an open exhi|bition of vice!&mdash;I cannot reconcile my&s;elf to the idea of an immoral patriot, or to that &s;eparation of private from public virtue, which &s;ome think to be po&s;&s;ible. Is it to be expected that&mdash;But I mu&s;t forbear. I am afraid of applications, which many are too ready to make, and for which I &s;hould be &s;orry to give any ju&s;t occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I HAVE been explaining to you the nature and expre&s;&s;ions of a ju&s;t regard to our Country. Give me leave to exhort you to examine your conduct by what I have been &s;aying. You love your coun|try, and de&s;ire its happine&s;s; and, without doubt, you have the greate&s;t rea&s;on for loving it. It has been long a very di&s;tingui&s;hed and favoured coun|try. Often has God appeared for it, and deliver|ed it. Let us &s;tudy to &s;hew our&s;elves worthy of the favour &s;hewn us.&mdash;Do you practice virtue your|&s;elves, and &s;tudy to promote it in others? Do you obey the laws of your country, and aim at doing
<PB N="37" REF="022814_0035_0FBA67B17A50B9E8">
your part towards maintaining and perpetuating its privileges? Do you always give your vote on the &s;ide of public liberty; and are you ready to pour out your blood in its defence? Do you look up to God for the continuance of his favour to your coun|try, and pray for its pro&s;perity; pre&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, a &s;trict regard to the rights of other countries, and always con&s;idering your&s;elves more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community? If this is your temper and conduct you are ble&s;&s;ings to your country, and were all like you, this world would &s;oon be a heaven.</P>
<P>I AM addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Chri&s;tians. Let me, therefore, mention to you the example of our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour. I have ob&s;erved, at the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that he did not inculcate upon his hearers the love of their country, or take any notice of it as a part of our duty. In&s;tead of doing this, I ob&s;erved that he taught the obligation to love all mankind, and recommended univer&s;al benevolence, as (next to the love of God) our fir&s;t duty; and, I think, I al&s;o proved to you, that this, in the circum|&s;tances of the world at that time, was an in&s;tance of incomparable wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in his in|&s;tructions. But we mu&s;t not infer from hence, that he did not include the love of our country in the number of our duties. He has &s;hewn the contra|ry by his example. It appears that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a particular affection for his country, though a very wicked country. We read in Luke x. 42, that when, upon approaching <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in one of his
<PB N="38" REF="022814_0036_0FBA67B66F42D8B0">
la&s;t journies to it, he beheld it, he wept over it, and &s;aid, <HI>Oh! that thou had&s;t known (even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy day) the things that belong to thy peace.</HI>&mdash;What a tender &s;olicitude about his country does the lamentation over <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> imply, which is re|corded in the &s;ame go&s;pel, chap. xiii. and 34. <HI>Oh! Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them who are &s;ent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gather|eth her brood under her wings, but ye would not.</HI></P>
<P>IT may not be improper farther to mention the love St. Paul expre&s;&s;ed for his country, when he declared, that, for the &s;ake of his brethren and kin&s;men, he could even wi&s;h him&s;elf <HI>accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t.</HI> (Rom. ix. 3.) The original words are an ANATHEMA <HI>from Chri&s;t;</HI> and his meaning is, that he could have been contented to &s;uffer <HI>him&s;elf</HI> the calamities which were coming on the Jewi&s;h peo|ple, were it po&s;&s;ible for him, by &s;uch a &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>It is too evident that the &s;tate of this country is &s;uch as renders it an object of concern and anxiety. It wants (I have &s;hewn you) the grand &s;ecurity of public liberty. Increa&s;ing luxury has multiplied abu&s;es in it. A mon&s;trous weight of debt is crip|pling it. Vice and venality are bringing down up|on it God's di&s;plea&s;ure. That &s;pirit to which it owes its di&s;tinctions, is declining; and &s;ome late events &s;eem to prove that it is becoming every day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reconcileable to encroachments on the &s;ecu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> of its liberties.&mdash;It wants, therefore, your pa|triotic
<PB N="39" REF="022814_0037_0FBA67B9D8661FD0">
&s;ervices; and, for the &s;ake of the di&s;tinctions it has &s;o longed enjoyed; for the &s;ake of our bre|thren and companions, and all that &s;hould be dear to a free people, we ought to do our utmo&s;t to &s;ave it from the dangers that threaten it; remembering, that by acting thus, we &s;hall promote, in the be&s;t manner, our own private intere&s;t, as well as the in|tere&s;t of our country; for when the community pro&s;pers, the individuals that compo&s;e it mu&s;t pro&s;|per with it.&mdash;But, &s;hould that not happen, or &s;hould we even &s;uffer in our &s;ecular intere&s;t by our endea|vours to promote the intere&s;t of our country, we &s;hall feel a &s;atisfaction in our own brea&s;ts which is preferable to all this world can give; and we &s;hall enjoy the tran&s;porting hope of &s;oon becoming mem|bers of a perfect community in the heavens, and having <HI>an entrance mini&s;tered to us, abundantly into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>You may rea&s;onably expect, that I &s;hould now clo&s;e this addre&s;s to you. But I cannot yet di&s;mi&s;s you. I mu&s;t not conclude without recalling, par|ticularly, to your recollection, a con&s;ideration to which I have more than once alluded, and which, probably, your thoughts have been all along anti|cipating: A con&s;ideration with which my mind is impre&s;&s;ed more than I can expre&s;s. I mean, the con&s;ideration of the favourablene&s;s of the pre&s;ent times to all exertions in the cau&s;e of public liberty.</P>
<P>WHAT an eventful period is this! I am thankful that I have lived to it; and I could almo&s;t &s;ay,
<PB N="40" REF="022814_0038_0FBA67BC6CA2C9D0">
<HI>Lord, now lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation.</HI> I have lived to &s;ee a diffu&s;ion of knowledge, which has undermin|ed &s;uper&s;tition and error&mdash;I have lived to &s;ee the rights of men better under&s;tood than ever; and nations panting for liberty, which &s;eemed to have lo&s;t the idea of it.&mdash;I have lived to &s;ee THIRTY MILLIONS of people, indignant and re&s;olute, burn|ing at &s;lavery, and demanding liberty with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> irre|&s;i&s;tible voice; their king led in triumph, and an arbitrary monarch &s;urrendering him&s;elf to his &s;ub|jects.&mdash;After &s;haring in the benefits of one Revo|lution, I have been &s;pared to be a witne&s;s to two other Revolutions, both glorious.&mdash;And now, methinks, I &s;ee the ardour for liberty catching and &s;preading; a general amendment beginning in hu|man affairs; the dominion of kings changed for the dominion of laws, and the dominion of prie&s;ts giv|ing way to the dominion of rea&s;on and con&s;cience.</P>
<P>BE encouraged, all ye friends of freedom, and writers in its defence! The times are au&s;picious. Your labours have not been in vain. Behold king|doms, admoni&s;hed by you, &s;tarting from &s;leep, breaking their fetters, and claiming ju&s;tice from their oppre&s;&s;ors! Behold, the light you have &s;truck out, after &s;etting <HI>America</HI> free, reflected to <HI>France,</HI> and there kindled into a blaze that lays de&s;poti&s;m in a&s;hes, and warms and illuminates <HI>Europe!</HI></P>
<P>TREMBLE all ye oppre&s;&s;ors of the world! Take warning all ye &s;upporters of &s;lavi&s;h governments, and &s;lavi&s;h hierarchies! Call no more (ab&s;urdly and wickedly) REFORMATION, innovation. You cannot now hold the world in darkne&s;s. Struggle no longer again&s;t increa&s;ing light and liberality. Re&s;tore to mankind their rights; and con&s;ent to the correction of abu&s;es, before they and you are de&s;troyed together.</P>
