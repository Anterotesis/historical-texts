<L>To thee my God I daily &s;igh, but not for golden &s;tores</L>
<L>Nor covet I the brighte&s;t Gems on the rich Ea&s;tern &s;hore,</L>
<L>Nor Plea&s;ures &s;oft enticing charms, my fond de&s;ires alure.</L>

<HEAD>Dying Speech, Life &amp; Confe&s;&s;ion Of JOHN YOUNG,</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"Man is born to trouble as the Sparks fly upwards"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE World u&s;ually anticipate from an un|fortunate man in a &s;ituation like mine, a dying confe&s;&s;ion; not &s;o much to comply with this cu&s;tom as to remove the odium that now does, and after my decea&s;e may exi&s;t in the minds of many, if I pa&s;s hence into eternity, "from who&s;e bourne no traveller returns," without &s;uch a narrative, has induced me to pen the following lines. To vouch for the truth of them I pre&s;ume nothing need be &s;aid more, than that they are the la&s;t words of a dying man, who looks for|ward with the plea&s;ing hope of &s;alvation and comfort in regions of bli&s;s far beyond what this tran&s;itory life can afford.</P>
<P>I die, &s;o do all mankind, but I die untimely, mine is an unhappy end It needs not then that I &s;peak of my parents and relations, who or what they are, is of little moment to the Public, thus &s;ilent, they will avoid the taunts of unfeeling men I &s;hall therefore touch not on the tran&s;actions of my life at an early period, but confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e leading points, that have precipitated me in the vortex of ignominious di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>In 1793 I was in a re&s;pected &s;ituation at Phi|ladelphia as a publi&s;her of Mu&s;ic, carre&s;&s;ed by men of Virtue and Influence, as I had no capital I was nece&s;&s;itated to attempt to extend the Sale of my Merchandize by Sub&s;cription over the whole Continent, with this view I proceeded to Charle&s;ton, from thence to New-York, took up
<PB N="3" REF="033255_0003_0FF769B99D9987A8">
my Lodgings at Mrs. Wei&s;enfelt's, finding my|&s;elf unable to pro&s;ecute my plan on an exten&s;ive Scale, and being much pre&s;&s;ed for Money I en|gaged with Mr. Ricketts as a Mu&s;ician, about this time I became acquainted with a Mr. Daniel Thew, Notary Public of this City, from the ap|parent advantages that might ari&s;e by the Publi|cation of Mu&s;ic, he made me propo&s;als to ad|vance a capital provided he received his part of the Profit, we agreed, the Sum was to be 3 col. at his reque&s;t I went to Bo&s;ton to obtain Sub&s;cri|bers, he advanced for the expence of my Journey 95 Dollars. On my arrival, and afterwards I wrote him &s;everal Letters, but receiving no an|&s;wer I &s;u&s;pected his intentions were to deceive me, in con&s;equence of which I returned to New|York, on my arrival at my lodgings I found the the whole of my Apparel gone as well as upwards of 100 &s;cratched Songs, I could gain no further information on the &s;ubject, more than that Mr. Thew as my partner had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion my room and removed every thing in a few days after my departure for Bo&s;ton; in a &s;hort time I was &s;erved with a writ at the &s;uit of this very Thew, for the monies advanced for my Journey from Bo&s;ton and about 30 dollars in addition, which he had paid on my account; de&s;titute as I was, I must have gone to Gaol, had not that worthy man Mr. Abraham Skinner by his humanity pre|vented it, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;appointments invol|ved me in difficulties, my Creditors became cla|morous, I was again arre&s;ted in the Bear Market by one who called him&s;elf a deputy Sheriff,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Handay &s;ide.</NOTE> and was dragged near a mile, when lo! I di&s;covered he had no writ, but was privy to Mr. Canon's
<PB N="4" REF="033255_0004_0FF769BB20661528">
having one again&s;t me, to who&s;e cu&s;tody I was turned over, Thus it is Debtors are abu&s;ed, thus it is, in a State who boa&s;t their protection of the &s;ubject and their dete&s;tation of de&s;potic &s;way, permit their admini&s;trators of Ju&s;tice to twi&s;t an arbitary con&s;truction of the Laws, to countenance the&s;e hirelings to di&s;tre&s;s the hone&s;t tho' unfortu|nate Citizens it requires more than mortal forti|tude to re&s;i&s;t puni&s;hing &s;uch mortals, who regard more extortion, than the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice</P>
<P>I was conducted to Goal previous to this, and after my connection with Thew, I entered into partner&s;hip with one I&s;aac Samo, to who&s;e ba&s;e|ne&s;s I attribute Berwick's and my death. He ad|vanced me 50 dollars, and afterwards 60 more, in part of his contract with me of 150 dollars, the &s;um agreed on. Soon after the commence-of the publication, I was arre&s;ted as above men|tioned. Samo refu&s;ed to bail me; he pretended the bu&s;ine&s;s would be at a &s;tand, and he &s;hould loo&s;e his money. Though it appeared plain to me afterwards, his only intention was to get all the materials in his own hands, and gather from me as much information as po&s;&s;ible, relative to the bu&s;ine&s;s, with the view of commencing by him&s;elf, and leaving me in my misfortunes.</P>
<P>I continued in confinement near four months, when I was relieved by a new contract with Mr. Ricketts; &s;ome time after my di&s;charge I received a note from a Mr. CONSTANT an Attorney, reque&s;ting to &s;ee me. I called on him, he infor|med me he had an account again&s;t me at the &s;uit of Mrs. Miller, with whom I formerly boarded, I was a&s;toni&s;hed, as I did not conceive I was in|debted to her any thing; &s;he had at various
<PB N="5" REF="033255_0005_0FF769BF4C9FCBD8">
times received money from me to the amount of Eighty-three dollars, and had departed for Am|&s;terdam; I refu&s;ing payment he &s;erved a writ on me, for which I gave bail, my a&s;toni&s;hment after|wards cea&s;ed when I was informed by a Mr. Crawford, whole&s;ale Grocer at the Ship-Yards, that this VERY HONEST LAWYER CONSTANT, had purcha&s;ed for Ten Dollars this imaginary debt of Mrs Miller; &s;hame, &s;hame on &s;uch prac|tices, practices that di&s;grace the name of civili|zation, which every hone&s;t mind mu&s;t revolt at, and which I am &s;orry too &s;ay, is too much coun|tenanced by tho&s;e who&s;e duty as well as inclina|tion &s;hould teach to puni&s;h more than encourage &s;uch infamy.</P>
<P>From this period I was continually harra&s;&s;ed with writ after writ till my life became mi&s;erable, at this time Samo called on me, propo&s;ed as there was little pro&s;pect of continuing the bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;hould give him my notes for the money advan|ced and he would wholly relinqui&s;h what he had of mine, I complied; gave them at 60, 90, and 120 days. I repeatedly &s;ent for the articles be|longing to me but without effect, but &s;eemed to intimate he &s;hould hold them as &s;ecurity for pay|ment of the Notes, this was an act of the great|e&s;t inju&s;tice which he be&s;t knows how to reconcile being compelled &s;ecrete my&s;elf fearful of arre&s;t, I neglected to give &s;peciel bail to Con&s;tants &s;uit, he obtained executiion again&s;t me, I was taken to Goal and remained in confinement thirteen weeks, when I was di&s;charged by pledging an In&s;trument and my Note for 85 dollars, in the in|terim Samo's notes became due, he pre&s;&s;ed me for the payment after my di&s;charge though he &s;till
<PB N="6" REF="033255_0006_0FF769A4544CF9C8">
held my property the only means I had of rai&s;ing the money for his payment, we had frequent conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject but could not effect any &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>At la&s;t on my return from Col. Burr's where I had been with mu&s;ic to Mrs. Temple, when &s;carcely in the hou&s;e ten minutes Berwick called on me &s;aid he had &s;omething again&s;t me at the &s;uit of Samo; I reque&s;ted him to go with me to Samo's hou&s;e about 30 yards di&s;tant, on my arri|val I &s;olicited a &s;ettlement, Samo ob&s;erved he had nothing to do in the bu&s;ine&s;s, my &s;tay was not more than three minutes we then walked away, this was at the top of Cedar &s;treet, we never went into any place nor &s;poke to any one till I &s;top'd at the bottom of the Park. I never &s;aw the writ, nor any thing he had again&s;t me, I re|que&s;ted him to go with me to &s;ome other place he po&s;itively &s;aid no; di&s;tre&s;'d in mind, harra&s;'d with my cares, and the dread of again being con|fined operated at this moment to determine me not to go to Gaol, I put my hand in pocket drew out a Pi&s;tol and at the &s;ame Time de&s;ired him repeatly aloud to keep his di&s;tance, he ra&s;hly re|fu&s;ed my advice, ru&s;hed on the mouth of the Pi|&s;tol, I fired without any direction other than a pointed arm, he fell&mdash;Let any man Judge what time it will take for two per&s;ons to walk a &s;mart pace from the top of Cedar &s;treet to the bottom of the Park, which was all the time he was with me except when at Samo's, they then can form an opinion what credit ought to be given to tho&s;e who &s;wore Berwick and I were together three hours previous to his death; as for the writ, I call God to witne&s;s I never &s;aw it till the morning of my trial before the Court.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033255_0007_0FF769C682CCCC00">
I pity from my Soul tho&s;e three unfortunate perjured people who &s;wore again&s;t me. I pray God to have mercy on them.</P>
<P>The one that &s;wore he heard Berwick &s;ay he was tired going about from place to place with me for three hours and that he would go no further.</P>
<P>The poor wretch that &s;wore we walked arm and arm together and that I declared he had taken many per&s;ons but &s;hould never take another when I &s;hot him; they are both fal&s;e. The day of puni&s;hment will come when their perjured con&s;ciences will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t them.</P>
<P>And the Mulatto who &s;wore &s;he was &s;o near us, that the &s;moke went in her face, and yet did not hear a word that pa&s;s'd between Berwick and my&s;elf; &s;he certainly mu&s;t have been between us, otherwi&s;e it could not have gone in her face, as I &s;aw it ri&s;e direct between Berwick and me.</P>
<P>I forgive them all, as well as my enemies who have delu|ded the&s;e people, and pray God to forgive them, as I hope he will forgive me. God Almighty ble&s;s my friends and all good people.</P>
<P>To authenticate the above writings, Mr. Abraham Skinner has the writings between Thew and me, Mr. Hunn, the agreement between Samo and my&s;elf, or on Mr. Wat&s;on, now in Pri&s;on, who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t writing between I&s;aac Samo and me, executed at the time I gave my note, though he afterwards refu&s;ed to com|ply with his own &s;ignature; he has likewi&s;e an account in Mrs. Millar's hand writing of what was due her, which CONSTANT gave me &s;o much trouble about.</P>
<P>Creditors tru&s;t not your papers in the hands of tho&s;e tolerated Leeches, that call them&s;elves Sheriff's Officers, Creditor or Debtor is of little con&s;equence to them, their only object is to &s;uck profit to them&s;elves. Many Attornies are no better, a Bill of Co&s;ts, and not the advantage of the Creditor, is u&s;ually the &s;timulus to their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Creditors! turn your Eyes to the only Ba&s;tile in this Land of boa&s;ted Freedom, &s;ee there many unfortunate worthy Citizens, &s;hut up from the World, their families, friends and relatives; and why: becau&s;e they are unable to di&s;charge in FULL their debts, remember that one Years impri&s;onment will not pay one &s;hilling of debt, re|member
