<P>THE Venerable <HI>Author</HI> of the en&s;uing Di&s;|cour&s;e, who was <HI>forever devi&s;ing</HI> Good, thinking how &s;erviceable and glorious it would be, if when <HI>Matrimony</HI> is Solemnized, it might be done with <HI>Devotion</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> and with a Concern that, when the <HI>Hands</HI> are <HI>joined</HI> and &s;o the <HI>united Hearts</HI> are &s;ignified, there may be a <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of their Souls and a <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> of their <HI>Wills,</HI> that their SAVIOUR may be theirs, <HI>e&s;pou&s;ed</HI> unto them and <HI>concerned</HI> for them: I &s;ay, the Venerable <HI>Author,</HI> reflecting on the&s;e things, prepared the following Di&s;cour&s;e for the Direction of (<HI>all</HI> indeed, but more e&s;pecially) tho&s;e engaging in this <HI>u&s;eful &amp; Heavenly In&s;titution.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The mo&s;t Marvellous <HI>Propo&s;al</HI> that ever was made among the Children of Men, calls now for a mo&s;t Admiring <HI>Attention</HI> from us.</HEAD>
<P>Tis that in, <BIBL>Rom. VII.4.</BIBL>
<Q>That ye &s;hould be MARRIED unto HIM who is Rai&s;ed from the Dead.</Q></P>
<P>CAN &s;uch a Thing be heard with|out A&s;toni&s;hment! &mdash;<HI>Sing O Hea|vens, and be Joyful, O Earth, and break forth into Singing, O Moun|tains</HI>; For, Oh! how a&s;toni&s;hing are the <HI>Comforts</HI> which the Glorious Lord has for his Cho&s;en People.</P>
<P><HI>Married</HI> unto a Glorious Christ, <HI>Rai&s;ed from the Dead,</HI> and &s;o taken up to, and &s;itting down on, the <HI>Throne of GOD.</HI> O Wonderful! O Wonderful! The Soul of a poor, Fooli&s;h, Filthy Creature; the Soul of a Mi&s;erable Sinner,&mdash;<HI>Married</HI> unto the Only Begotten Son of God, who has all the Angels in the Heavens forever Ordered by Him, and Ador|ing of Him! To be <HI>Commanded</HI> by Him, is a <HI>Dig|nity</HI>; To be <HI>Employed</HI> for Him, is an <HI>Advancement,</HI> beyond what we can de&s;ire.

Children of Men! Verily, tis a matter which cannot (be &s;ufficiently wondred at! But it is a matter, which we now have in pro&s;ecution and in expectation.</P>
<P>Behold, an lllu&s;trious Demon&s;tration, That Be|lievers on a Glorious Christ are delivered from the <HI>Dominion of Sin.</HI> The <HI>Evil principle</HI> which di&s;po&s;es us to Sin, is mortified and extingui&s;hed in Believers, to &s;uch a degree, that tho' the <HI>Continuance</HI> of it is an Intolerable <HI>Vexation</HI> unto them, yet it has not a <HI>Dominion</HI> over them. While we remain under the <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> or the <HI>Covenant</HI> made with the <HI>Fir&s;t Adam,</HI> as the <HI>Head</HI> of his <HI>Natural Offspring,</HI> we are under a Law which requires a <HI>perfect Obedience</HI> from us, but at the &s;ame time it affords us no <HI>Strength</HI> for that <HI>Obedience</HI>: No; our <HI>Corrupt Nature</HI> is there|by irritated unto <HI>Rebellion</HI> rather than annimated unto <HI>Obedience,</HI> and [the <HI>Evil Principle</HI> gains the Force of a <HI>Law</HI> upon us. The Law which in <HI>it &s;elf</HI> is <HI>Holy,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> in the <HI>Event</HI> is turned into, a <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> unto us. If we read a few Lines more, we cannot but &s;tand amazed at the Blindne&s;s of them, who exclude the <HI>Moral Law</HI> of the <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> from the meaning of the Apo&s;tles, and expound it only for the Law of the <HI>Mo&s;aical Ceremonies,</HI> when here we read of being <HI>Delivered from the Law.</HI> But now, our Ble&s;&s;ed Jesus is a <HI>Second Adam.</HI> And by our being united unto HIM, we are brought into a <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> In that <HI>Covenant</HI> the Redeemer, to whom we are <HI>united,</HI> makes Attonement for our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, again&s;t the <HI>Law,</HI> an&s;wers the Demands of the <HI>Law</HI> in our &s;tead, and conveys into us by his Good Spirit a <HI>principle of Life,</HI> which quickens us to endeavour a <HI>perfection of Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Strengthens</HI> us to make a Gradual Progre&s;s towards a <HI>perfection of Holine&s;s in the Fear of GOD.</HI> Thus we become <HI>Dead unto the Law</HI>! Our Hopes of obtaining the <HI>Ju&s;tification of Life</HI> by our own doing of the <HI>Works</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> re|quires,

are all <HI>Dead.</HI> We have laid a&s;ide all Hopes of coming to <HI>Life,</HI> on tho&s;e Terms of the <HI>Law, Do and Live.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> is al&s;o <HI>Dead</HI> unto us, and can make no more claim upon us, to adhere unto tho&s;e Terms of, <HI>Do and Live,</HI> than a <HI>Dead Man</HI> can upon one that he was once by <HI>Marriage</HI> a Ma&s;ter of. Chri&s;tians, You have the very <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>Marrow</HI> of the Go&s;pel, and a plain Glo&s;s upon a famous Paragraph of the Sacred Scriptures, in the&s;e few Communications. But what is our Condition in this <HI>Change of our State</HI> before the Lord? And what is it that brings us into this Happy Condition? Tis this Marvellous Felicity; Our <HI>Marriage</HI> with a Redeemer that is <HI>Rai&s;ed from the Dead.</HI> Of this I am now to Entertain you with a DOCTRINE, that brings unto us tho&s;e <HI>Con&s;olatioas of GOD,</HI> which, O <HI>Hard-Hearted</HI> we, if they be <HI>Small</HI> unto us!</P>
<P>A Soul <HI>Married</HI> unto a Jesus <HI>Rai&s;ed from the Dead,</HI> is an <HI>Happy</HI> Soul. And it is by <HI>Marrying</HI> of us unto Him&s;elf that a Glorious CHRIST brings us to all the <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> which He has purpos'd and purchas'd for us. Our Apo&s;tle, Speaking of a People by his Mini&s;try brought home unto GOD, and made an Happy People, &s;ays, 2 Cor. XI.2. <HI>I have E&s;|pou&s;ed you unto one Husband, that I may pre&s;ent you as a cha&s;t Virgin unto CHRIST.</HI> This, This is the main intent and bu&s;ine&s;s of the Evangelical Mini&s;try. The Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are tho&s;e <HI>Friends of the Bridegroom,</HI> that have a Work to do upon that Noble De&s;ign; To <HI>E&s;pou&s;e</HI> the Souls of their People, unto a Glorious Christ, who is willing to become an <HI>Husband</HI> unto them. Now to bring about this Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to the Souls, with and for whom we are concerned, we are going to lay before you the mo&s;t Important Things, that ever you were addre&s;&s;ed upon; And we make our Addre&s;s to you, with &s;uch a pathetic Ob&s;ervation, <HI>Hearken to
<PB N="4" REF="003061_0006_0FEFB32A754A9BD0">
me, that GOD may hearken unto you another Day.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Glorious REDEEMER makes unto your <HI>Souls,</HI> O our Go&s;pelized People, a Propo&s;al to make you Happy in an ESPOUSAL unto Him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Can our Souls be any other than &s;wallowed up with Admiration at the <HI>My&s;tery.</HI></P>
<P>The Infinite Son of GOD, <HI>E&s;pou&s;ed</HI> the <HI>Nature</HI> of Man, when <HI>the Word was made Fle&s;h,</HI> and he conde&s;cended &s;o far as to take a Man in <HI>One Per|&s;on</HI> with Him&s;elf. The Almighty King, overlook|ing all the Tribes of <HI>Created,</HI> and even of <HI>Angelic</HI> Beings, <HI>E&s;pou&s;ed</HI> unto Him&s;elf a Queen, from the Family of <HI>Mankind.&mdash;Lord what are we? And what is our Fathers Hou&s;e?</HI> This He did, tho' He &s;aw the Depravation which Mankind by a Fall from God comes to Sink into. A Thing which, Oh! how &s;hould we celebrate the <HI>Grace</HI>! <HI>Grace</HI>! that we &s;ee &s;hining in it! What an Honour does it put upon the Humane Race! And how &s;hould it Encourage our Approaches unto our GOD.</P>
<P>But now, the GOD-MAN, or Immanuel, is upon the Glorious De&s;ign of <HI>E&s;pou&s;ing</HI> to Him&s;elf a Church of People, cull'd and call'd out of <HI>Man|kind,</HI> into the <HI>Faith</HI> of Him. There is a CHURCH of Believers on Him, a <HI>People formed for him&s;elf, to &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w forth his prai&s;e,</HI> whom in a My&s;tical MARRIAGE He reckons Him&s;elf <HI>E&s;pou&s;ed</HI> unto. This Church is by that <HI>Lamb of GOD</HI> Expre&s;&s;ly called, <HI>his WIFE</HI>: And Effectually bringing this People into a <HI>Reconciliation</HI> with God, He &s;ays, Jer. III.14. <HI>I Marry my &s;elf unto you.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e with whom we are principally now concerned, would be little edified; with the Traditions among the <HI>Jews,</HI> of the <HI>Marriage</HI> between <HI>Tipheret</HI> and <HI>Maleuth,</HI> [So the Jewi&s;h Thrology calls the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and his <HI>Church</HI>] which we apprehend repre&s;ented in the Song of <HI>Solo|mon,</HI> and in the <HI>Forty-fifth P&s;alm</HI> of his Father <HI>David,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003061_0007_0FEFB33FC2BE7FD8">
which that Song was built upon. Tis enough to &s;ay, That People bro't into the Life of GOD, have that word fulfill'd unto them; Ho&s;. II.18, 19. <HI>I will e&s;pou&s;e thee unto me for ever; yea, I Will e&s;pou&s;e thee unto me in Ju&s;tice, and in Judgment, and in Loving-Kindne&s;s, and in Mercies. I will even e&s;pou&s;e thee unto me in Faithfulne&s;s, and thou &s;halt know the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But then, What we would more particularly in&s;ist upon, is, That every particular Soul brought home unto God, is <HI>E&s;pou&s;ed</HI> unto the SON of God. GOD the KING <HI>Eternal, Immortal, Invi&s;ible, makes a Marriage for His SON</HI> in the <HI>Conver&s;ion of a Sinner</HI> to Him. In the moment that any of you make the Flight of a Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul unto your SAVIOUR, who has in Him the <HI>Only Name,</HI> [even the Name of JEHOVAH] <HI>whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved,</HI> and entreat of Him, and rely on Him, for His <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> from that Moment thou art E&s;pou&s;ed unto Him, and in whatever part of the Earth He finds thee, His Voice to thee, is that, I&s;a. LIV.5. <HI>Thy Maker is thy Hus|band ; and thy Redeemer; the G0D of the whole Earth &s;hall he be called.</HI></P>
<P>This, This is the <HI>E&s;pou&s;al,</HI> unto which, O Soul Enjoying the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of the Go&s;pel, thou art now therein Sollicited.</P>
<P>The Method of coming into the unparallell'd <HI>E&s;pou|&s;al,</HI> and &s;o unto Everla&s;ting <HI>Happin&s;es,</HI> is briefly this.</P>
<P>There is a COVENANT of Life, wherein the SON of GOD has engaged the&s;e Two things unto his FA|THER, on the behalf of his People which are in the Eternal <HI>Election</HI> of GOD <HI>given</HI> unto Him: The Fir&s;t That he will by an&s;wering the Law of GOD for them, furni&s;h them with a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and a <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> on the pleading whereof they &s;hall be <HI>Forgiven</HI> and <HI>Accepted</HI> with Him: The Second, That He will write the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD in their Hearts, and <HI>Heal</HI> all that is ami&s;s in them, and <HI>work in them
<PB N="6" REF="003061_0008_0FEFB32C76A570E0">
what is well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD,</HI> and having by a <HI>Sanctifying work</HI> upon their <HI>whole Man,</HI> prepared them for the <HI>Inheritance of the Saints,</HI> bring them to the <HI>Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ings of the Heavenly places.</HI> A Soul de&s;iring to be comprehended in the Engage|ments of this COVENANT, and con&s;enting that a Glorious CHRIST &s;hould <HI>fulfill</HI> for it and in it, all <HI>this Good Plea&s;ure of His Goodne&s;s,</HI> is brought into the COVENANT of Grace, and is therein <HI>E&s;pou&s;ed unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This Tran&s;action appears under the Character of a <HI>Marriage,</HI> becau&s;e from this Time, there is an UNION, and not only a <HI>Legal Union,</HI> but al&s;o a <HI>Vital Union,</HI> between the <HI>Redeemer</HI> and the <HI>Believer.</HI> It comes to that, Joh. XIV.20. <HI>You in Me, and I in You:</HI> As upon an E&s;pou&s;al, the <HI>Married Couple</HI> becomes <HI>One fle&s;h,</HI> &s;o the <HI>Redeemer</HI> and the <HI>Believer</HI> become ONE, both in point of <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and in point of <HI>Influence.</HI> The Debts of the <HI>Believer</HI> ly on the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and the <HI>Redeemer</HI> pays them all. The <HI>claims</HI> of the <HI>Redeemer</HI> are imparted unto the <HI>Believer,</HI> and the <HI>Believer</HI> is Entitled unto His precious <HI>Benefits</HI>; What He has bought belongs to thee, <HI>O thou Ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord.</HI> At the &s;ame time the <HI>Redeemer</HI> does Conver&s;e with the <HI>Believer</HI>; and <HI>follow him with Goodne&s;s and Mercy all his Days,</HI> and receives him into the <HI>Man&s;ions</HI> of His <HI>Fathers Hou&s;e</HI> at the proper period of his Days, and Show, Oh! <HI>What Wonders to the Dead!</HI> The <HI>Believer</HI> does depend on the <HI>Re|deemer</HI> for all the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings of Goodne&s;s,</HI> and pay Him all po&s;&s;ible <HI>Affection</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI>; Delighting in <HI>Communion</HI> with Him; and Re&s;olving to be <HI>for Him and not for another.</HI> He is thy Lord, and, O Loyal and Faithful one, Thou do&s;t <HI>Wor&s;hip Him.</HI></P>
<P>That which gives yet a further Appearance of a <HI>Marriage</HI> in this Grand Affair, is, Its conformity to what pa&s;&s;ed in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and the <HI>Fir&s;t Marriage,</HI> even that which was made in <HI>Para|di&s;e.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="003061_0009_0FEFB3417107D588">
An Apo&s;tle of GOD Writing of that <HI>Marriage</HI> &s;ays, Eph. V.32. <HI>This is a Great My&s;tery: But I &s;peak about CHRIST and his Church. Adam</HI> was thrown into a &s;ort of a <HI>Swoon,</HI> wherein GOD as I conceive, Extracted from his whole <HI>Inward,</HI> (which we render his <HI>Rib</HI>) the Sub&s;tance, which He framed into the Shape that He gave to Eve, and which was <HI>Bone of his Bones, and Fle&s;h of his Fle&s;h</HI>: So that &s;he became his <HI>Con&s;ort,</HI> who was al&s;o his <HI>Offspring.</HI> Accordingly a Glorious CHRIST having pa&s;&s;ed thro' the Agonies and Convul&s;ions of <HI>Death</HI> for it, has tho&s;e produced for Him, and for a mo&s;t Intimate and Endearing Fellow&s;hip with Him; who are al&s;o pro|duced <HI>from</HI> Him, and are indeed His <HI>Offspring.</HI> He Sees His own Seed in them, and He owns them for <HI>Members of his Body, of his Fle&s;h, and of his Bones.</HI> And <HI>as the Bridegroom rejoyces over the Bride, &s;o &s;hall thy GOD rejoyce over thee,</HI> O Soul, willing to be the Lord's.</P>
<P>This then is the Thing propo&s;ed by our SAVI|OUR to us. Yea, <HI>Hear this O all ye People, Every one of you!</HI> Tis to <HI>Every One of You</HI> all, that our SAVIOUR does propo&s;e it; and this is the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> to be <HI>Preached unto Every Creature.</HI> Soul, be willing to come into an UNION with thy SAVIOUR.</P>
