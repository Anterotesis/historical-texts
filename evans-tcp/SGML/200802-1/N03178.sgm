<P>_THE mo&s;t acceptable Service we can render to GOD, is BENEFICENCE to <HI>Man.</HI> There are Three Ways of be|nefitting our Fellow Creatures. We may be u&s;eful to their Souls, by good In&s;truction, and good Example. We may be helpful to their Bodies, by feed|ing the Hungry, cloathing the Naked, and pre&s;cribing ea&s;y Remedies to the Sick: We can aid them in their Fortunes, by encou|raging

of Indu&s;try, by relieving the Di&s;|tre&s;t, and doing all the kind Offices we are able, to our Neighbours. The&s;e are the &s;everal Ways of improving the Talents our Maker has entru&s;ted us with; and we mu&s;t every one expect, hereafter to give an Account, how we have employ'd them.</P>
<P>I WISH it were in my Power, to &s;erve Mankind, more than I do, in each of the&s;e Particulars; but the gracious Ac|ceptance of the Widow's Offering, encou|rages me al&s;o to ca&s;t my MITE into the Trea&s;ury. I publi&s;h this &s;hort Treati&s;e, to lead the Poorer Sort into the <HI>plea&s;ant Paths of Health;</HI> and when they have the Mi&s;|fortune to be <HI>&s;ick,</HI> to &s;hew them the cheap|e&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Ways of <HI>getting well</HI> again.</P>
<P>OUR Country is unhappily &s;ubject to &s;everal very &s;harp Di&s;tempers. The Mul|titude of Mar&s;hes, Swamps, and great Wa|ters, &s;end forth &s;o many Fogs, and Exha|lations, that the Air is continually damp with them: This, in Spight of our Precau|tions, is apt to &s;hut up the Pores all at once, and hinder in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration. From hence proceed FEVERS, COUGHS, QUINSIES, PLEURISIES, and CONSUMPTI|ONS, with a di&s;mal Train of other Di&s;ea&s;es,
<PB N="5" REF="003843_0003_10026338F27F17F0">
which make as fatal Havock here, in Pro|portion to our Number, as the PLAGUE does in the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts of the World.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, this is a cruel Check to the Growth of an Infant Colony, which otherwi&s;e, by the Fruitfulne&s;s of our Wo|men, and the great Number of Recruits, &s;ent from our Mother Country, would, in a few Years, grow populous, and con&s;e|quently con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the&s;e Calami|ties return every Year, without the tender|e&s;t Commi&s;eration. Certainly nothing can be more melancholly, than to have &s;o ma|ny poor People peri&s;h, purely for want of u&s;ing timely Means for their Pre&s;ervation. One Mi&s;chief is, mo&s;t of our Inhabitants have &s;uch an unrea&s;onable Aver&s;ion to <HI>Phy|&s;ick,</HI> (even where they may have it from their charitable Neighbours for nothing,) that they neglect to take any, 'til their Ca&s;e is grown de&s;perate, and Death begins to glare them in the Face. They con&s;ider not, that a moderate Skill may recover a Pati|ent in the Beginning of a Di&s;temper, while he has Strength to go thro' all the nece&s;&s;ary Operations, when the whole <HI>College</HI> would not be able to &s;ave him, after his Spirits

are &s;unk, and all the Principles of Life ve|ry near extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>THIS unhappy Temper occa&s;ions a great deal of Mortality: And what makes the Misfortune the greater, is, that it falls heavie&s;t on the Younger Sort, who are mo&s;t liable to hurrying Di&s;tempers. Indeed, &s;ome would be glad of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, if they did not think the Remedy near as bad as the Di&s;|ea&s;e: For our <HI>Doctors</HI> are commonly &s;o ex|orbitant in their Fees, whether they kill or cure, that the poor Patient had rather tru&s;t to his Con&s;titution, than run the Ri&s;que of beggaring his Family.</P>
<P>THESE Con&s;iderations made me ac|count it a Work of great Charity and Pub|lick Spirit, to communicate to the poor In|habitants of this Colony, a &s;afe Method of curing them&s;elves, when they &s;hall be &s;o unhappy as to fall into any of our common Maladies. And for their greater Encou|ragement, the Remedies I &s;hall pre&s;cribe, may be procured with little Trouble and Expence, being, for the mo&s;t Part, &s;uch as grow at their own Doors, or may be ea&s;ily propagated.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003843_0004_10026370B939B050">
PROVIDENCE has been &s;o good, as to furni&s;h almo&s;t every Country with Medicines proper for the Di&s;tempers inci|dent to the Climate; and &s;uch Dome&s;tick Remedies are always &s;ufficient for the Poor, who live upon homely Fare, and for the Temperate, who make a right U&s;e of GOD's Ble&s;&s;ings. Their Ca&s;es are &s;eldom compli|cated, and proceed, for the mo&s;t Part, from Cold, or &s;ome &s;light Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. In &s;uch Ailments, the Symptoms cannot ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken, nor is the <HI>Cure</HI> difficult; all the <HI>Secret</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>taking the Di&s;temper in Time:</HI> And this will be the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es that happen from Cold, are excedingly violent, and call aloud for &s;pee|dy A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I MUST therefore conjure my dear Country folks, to begin with them&s;elves as &s;oon as they can di&s;tingui&s;h what Sickne&s;s they have, while Nature is &s;trong, and able to co-operate with the Medicines they take. Nor can we hope, that Heaven will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our Calamities, unle&s;s we endeavour, at the &s;ame Time, to a&s;&s;i&s;t our&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN &s;etting down the following Pre&s;crip|tions, I have been cautions of talking like
<PB N="8" REF="003843_0005_10039777120F17B8">
an <HI>Apothecary;</HI> that is, of u&s;ing hard Words, that perhaps neither my Patient, nor my &s;elf under&s;tand. Nor have I taken them lightly upon Tru&s;t; but am able to recommend mo&s;t of them upon more than Twenty Years Experience; and for the re&s;t, I have credible Authority. In the mean Time, I hope, none will object, like <HI>Naa|man,</HI> the <HI>Syrian,</HI> to the Ea&s;ine&s;s of any of the&s;e Remedies; but rather rejoice, that they can have the greate&s;t of all Ble&s;&s;ings &s;o very cheap. And in Truth, People mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ove Difficulty extremely, to &s;light Health, as they would a Mi&s;tre&s;s, for being gain'd with little Trouble.</P>
<P>BEFORE I mention the <HI>Cure,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to de&s;cribe the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of each Di&s;temper, in &s;o plain a Manner, that any Per&s;on may be Ma&s;ter of his own Ca&s;e, if he will but attend carefully to what he feels; otherwi&s;e he might mi&s;take his Illne&s;s, and apply an improper Remedy. I &s;hall al&s;o recommend the <HI>Diet</HI> fitte&s;t to be u&s;ed in each Ca&s;e; which often contributes more to the Patient's Recovery, than his <HI>Phy&s;ick:</HI> At the &s;ame Time, he &s;hall have my be&s;t Advice, to prevent every particular Ail|ment; which will be happier for him, than to know how to cure it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003843_0005_10039777120F17B8">
I SHALL begin with the mo&s;t fatal of all our Di&s;tempers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleuri&s;y.</NOTE> a PLEURISY; which di&s;covers it &s;elf by a brisk Fever, and &s;harp&punc; Pain, pretty low in one of the Sides, &s;hoot|ing now and then into the Brea&s;t, and &s;ome|times quite back into the Shoulder-Blades: It is unea&s;y every Time the Patient draws his Breath, and more &s;o when he coughs; which is generally the Ca&s;e in this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Moment any Per&s;on finds the&s;e Tokens upon him, he mu&s;t, without Lo&s;s of Time, take away 10 Ounces of <HI>Blood,</HI> and repeat the &s;ame three or four Days &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, if the Pain go not away before. On the third Day, he may vomit with 80 Grains of <HI>Indian Phy&s;ick, (Ipecacuania,)</HI> and eve|ry Night, drink 7 Spoonfuls of <HI>Pennyroyal Water,</HI> or the Decoction of it&punc; moderately &s;weeten'd. In the mean Time, let him, every three Hours, take Half a Spoonful of <HI>Honey</HI> and <HI>Lin&s;eed Oyl,</HI> mixt together. He &s;hould al&s;o &s;trew <HI>Indian Pepper,</HI> upon <HI>Pen|nyroyal Plai&s;ter,</HI> and apply it very hot to the Place where the Pain lies, and be &s;ure to keep him&s;elf warm, and ab&s;tain from cold Water: Tho' it the Di&s;temper &s;hould prove ob&s;tinate, you mu&s;t apply a <HI>Bli&s;ter</HI> to his Neck, and one to each Arm, on the fle&s;hy Part above the Elbow.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003843_0006_1002635AC98F1908">
THE Patient's <HI>Diet</HI> &s;hould be light, and cooling; and his con&s;tant Drink, either <HI>Lin&s;eed</HI> or <HI>Bawm Tea,</HI> a little &s;weeten'd.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t Way to prevent this Di&s;tem|per, will be, to <HI>bleed</HI> in the Beginning of any great Hoar&s;ene&s;s, or Cough, which are often the Forerunners of it; and al&s;o to forbear &s;willing great Quantities of Water, or Small Beer, in ordinary Life.</P>
<P>SOMETHING a-kin to this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fever, Pain in the Head, Brea&s;t, Eye, or Ear.</NOTE> is a FEVER, and PAIN IN THE HEAD, OR BREAST, or both; and now and then, an Inflammation, and Pain in the EYE, or EAR. In the&s;e Ca&s;es, you mu&s;t, without Lo&s;s of Time, <HI>bleed</HI> 10 Ounces. The next Day, <HI>purge</HI> with the <HI>Decoction of Mallows,</HI> and 3 Spoonfuls of <HI>Syrup of Peach Blo&s;|&s;oms.</HI> If the Pain &s;hould continue, you mu&s;t <HI>bleed</HI> again the third Day, and the Morrow following repeat the <HI>Purge:</HI> And if the Pain be &s;till ob&s;tinate, you mu&s;t re|new both <HI>Bleeding</HI> and <HI>Purging</HI> a third Time. In the very Beginning, apply the following <HI>Poultis</HI> to the Part where the Pain lies: Boil the Leaves of <HI>Sage, Wormwood,</HI> and <HI>Rue</HI> together, and having beat them &s;oft, grate Nutmeg thick upon them, and
<PB N="11" REF="003843_0006_1002635AC98F1908">
bind them on warm, renewing the &s;ame Night and Morning: And in Ca&s;e the Di&s;|ea&s;e hold out again&s;t all this, your la&s;t Re|fuge mu&s;t be a <HI>Bli&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Diet</HI> &s;hould be moi&s;t, and cool|ing, &s;uch as <HI>Thin Hominy, Chicken-Breth,</HI> or <HI>Water-Gruel;</HI> and your Drink, <HI>Lin&s;eed,</HI> or <HI>Ground-Ivy Tea,</HI> moderately &s;weeten'd.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e will be al&s;o be&s;t prevent|ed by <HI>Bleeding</HI> in any violent Cold.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Di&s;temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quin&s;ey.</NOTE> con&s;equent to a Cold, is a QUINSEY, known by a Fever, with an Inflammation of the Glands about the Throat, and of the <HI>Uvula,</HI> to that Degree as to render all Swallowing difficult, and painful. For this, <HI>bleed</HI> immediately 10 Ounces, rather in the Jugular Vein, than in the Arm; and if the Ca&s;e be urgent, ap|ply a <HI>Bli&s;ter</HI> to the Neck. If the Inflam|mation &s;hould continue, <HI>bleed</HI> again next Day. The Morning after, take a <HI>Purge</HI> of the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Mallows,</HI> with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blo&s;&s;oms,</HI> repeating the &s;ame 3 &s;everal Times, re&s;ting one Day between. From the Beginning, <HI>gargle</HI> with Dr. <HI>Papa</HI>'s Liquor hereafter de&s;crib'd; and if the <HI>Uvu|la</HI> be much relax'd, drink Half a Pint of
<PB N="12" REF="003843_0007_1002635C90697638">
the &s;ame, Night and Morning, when you don't purge.</P>
<P>BUT in Ca&s;e it prove no more than a common SORE THROAT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sore-Throat.</NOTE> <HI>purge</HI> only once, and <HI>gargle</HI> with <HI>Papa</HI>'s Liquor.</P>
<P>IN both Ca&s;es, your <HI>Diet</HI> ought to be moi&s;t and cooling; and your Drink, <HI>Cinque|foil Tea.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to prevent the&s;e Complaints, remember to wa&s;h your Neck, and behind your Ears, every Morning, in cold Water; nor muffle up your &s;elf too warm, either Night or Day.</P>
<P>NEXT follows a CONSUMPTION,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ump|tion.</NOTE> a Di&s;temper flow and &s;ure, that is lately grown very common among&s;t us. Here Young People are more in Danger than their Elders, becau&s;e more liable to Inflam|mations. It is u&s;her'd in by a Cough of long Continuance, which by Degrees in|flames and ulcerates the Lungs, brings on a Hectick Fever, with a Spitting of bloody and corrupted Matter, and is generally at|tended with a Hoar&s;ene&s;s, and Night-Sweats. In the mean Time, the Patient will wa&s;te in Strength, and in Fle&s;h, while
<PB N="13" REF="003843_0007_1002635C90697638">
perhaps he may eat rather more than he u&s;ed to do when he was well.</P>
<P>AFTER the Ulcer comes to be formed in the Lungs, it will be difficult for inward Remedies to reach it. They may before that, perhaps, cool the Inflammation, as well as &s;weeten and dimini&s;h the &s;harp De|fluxion, &s;o as to prevent an Ulcer, but can rarely heal it. So likewi&s;e, <HI>Bli&s;ters</HI> and <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> may revul&s;e the Humour, and pre|vent the Mi&s;chief, if &s;ea&s;onably made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, all the Good we can hope for, in this melancholly Ca&s;e, mu&s;t be done while the Con&s;umption is appre|hended only, and not actually begun. I would then recommend <HI>Bleeding</HI> 2 or 3 Ounces every third Day, with a con&s;tant Riding about on Hor&s;eback, and Change of Air. This will help Nature to throw off the Evil that threatens her, by calming the Blood, opening the Pores, and promo|ting in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration. It may al&s;o enable her to make a vigorous Effort, by Means of a &s;ea&s;onable Boil, or Impo&s;thume, on the outward Parts of the Body. For that Intention, I would al&s;o advi&s;e the Pa|tient, to <HI>&s;have</HI> under the Arms, and apply
<PB N="14" REF="003843_0008_10020429B6DBE260">
<HI>Poulti&s;es,</HI> in order to draw the Mi&s;chief, if po&s;&s;ible, that Way. And for inward Me|dicines, let him only chew <HI>Sa&s;&s;afras Root</HI> every Morning fa&s;ting. I would likewi&s;e intreat him, before he goes to Bed, to take 3 <HI>Pills,</HI> made of <HI>Turpentine</HI> and <HI>Deers Dung,</HI> in equal Quantities: And, be&s;ides the&s;e, let him once a Week take a <HI>Purge</HI> of <HI>Mallows,</HI> and <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blo&s;&s;oms.</HI></P>
<P>LET his <HI>Diet</HI> be without Meat, and mixt with abundance of <HI>Turnips, roa&s;ted Apples, Rai&s;ins,</HI> and <HI>Liquorice;</HI> and let his Drink be, Beer brew'd with <HI>Ground-Ivy;</HI> avoiding &s;trong Liquors of every Sort, as he would Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Way to prevent this wa&s;ting Di&s;|ea&s;e, is never to &s;uffer a Cough to dwell upon you; but <HI>bleed</HI> in Time, and <HI>purge</HI> gently once a Week. In the mean while, eat not one Mor&s;el of Meat, nor drink any Thing &s;tronger than a little &s;ound <HI>Cider:</HI> And, to make the Game &s;ure, ride every fair Day, and breath as much as po&s;&s;ible in the open Air.</P>
<P>ANOTHER mi&s;chievous Di&s;temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bloody-Flux.</NOTE> is the BLOODY-FLUX; the Signs of which are, a &s;mall Fever, and grievous Griping.
<PB N="15" REF="003843_0008_10020429B6DBE260">
The Patient will al&s;o void &s;limy Excre|ments, &s;treak'd with Blood; and at the &s;ame Time, be cruelly tormented in his Bowels.</P>
<P>UPON the fir&s;t Appearance of the&s;e Symptoms, part with 8 Ounces of <HI>Blood.</HI> The next Day take 80 Grains of <HI>Indian Phy&s;ick,</HI> by Way of <HI>Vomit,</HI> and work it well with 2 Quarts of warm Water. The third Day, take 70 Grains of the &s;ame <HI>In|dian Phy&s;ick,</HI> in hot Broth, made pretty &s;alt; and then 'twill go off by Way of Stool, and &s;trengthen the Bowels.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, let the Food he takes, be either <HI>poach'd Eggs, Mutton,</HI> or <HI>Chicken-Broth,</HI> and his con&s;tant Drink, a <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>calcin'd Deers Horn,</HI> with a <HI>Plantain Leaf</HI> boil'd in it.</P>
<P>TO prevent this Di&s;ea&s;e, avoid &s;leeping on the cold Ground, and wading in the cold Water: Never eat immoderately of any Sort of Fruit, nor venture to drink new or foul Cider, by any Means.</P>
<P>AND becau&s;e &s;ome People, by fancy|ing this Di&s;temper catching, are fearful of going near tho&s;e unhappy Per&s;ons that have it, by which they often want the A&s;&s;i&s;|tance

that is nece&s;&s;ary; I may venture to a&s;&s;ure them, their Apprehen&s;ions are ground|le&s;s; and the Rea&s;on this Di&s;ea&s;e goes &s;ometimes round a Family, is, becau&s;e they live on the &s;ame Diet, and breath in the &s;ame Air; and then no Wonder if they fall into the &s;ame Di&s;orders, one after ano|ther, without any Manner of Infection.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o a Kind of WHITE-FLUX,<NOTE PLACE="marg">White-Flux.</NOTE> that will hurry a &s;trong Man out of his Life in a &s;hort Time. In this Ca&s;e, the Stools are frequent, without Gripes, or Blood, but flowing from the Patient like Water, and having a &s;mall Fever attend|ing it.</P>
<P>LOSE no Time in this ha&s;ty Di&s;ea&s;e, but <HI>vomit</HI> with <HI>Indian Phy&s;ick,</HI> and <HI>purge</HI> the next Day with the &s;ame. In the mean while, you will do well to wear &s;ome Skin girt tight on your Stomach and Belly, with the Furr next you, or el&s;e a Piece of &s;oft Flannel.</P>
<P>LET your Food be <HI>Ha&s;ty-Pudding, Panada,</HI> or <HI>Broth thickened with Flower,</HI> and grate <HI>Nutmeg</HI> into every Thing you eat; and let your Drink be, a <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Deers Horn,</HI> made with a Leaf of <HI>Plaintain.</HI></P>

IN order to prevent this Di&s;order, avoid Walking and Riding in the Night Air, guz|zling huge Draughts of cold Water, and de|vouring unrea&s;onable Quantities of Fruit, e&s;pecially of that which is not ripe.</P>

<P>THE COLICK is lately grown a ve|ry common Di&s;temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colick.</NOTE> and begins, gene|rally, with a grievous Pain in the Bowels; and, by being neglected, fixes at length in the Pit of the Stomach, where it &s;eems to bore like an Augre: The Patient frequent|ly vomits every Thing he &s;wallows, and can hardly go to Stool, even with the Help of purging Medicines.</P>
<P>PEOPLE thus afflicted, are apt to fly to Drams for Relief; but with lamentable Succe&s;s. The&s;e may ea&s;e a Fit &s;ometimes; but are &s;ure to add Fuel to the Fire, and make the Di&s;ea&s;e return with more Vio|lence. Be&s;ides, the&s;e Cordials have another

bad Con&s;equence; they are apt to make People, &s;oberly enough inclcin'd, by De|grees, grow too fond of their Phy&s;ick. To cure all which bad Effects at once, I would recommend this certain and ea&s;y Remedy: Let him leave off all &s;trong, windy, and fermented Liquors, and drink nothing but <HI>Water,</HI> enrich'd with a very brown Toa&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT if this Remedy &s;hould be e&s;teem'd wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e, I would, however, for the ea&s;ing a particular Fit, recommend 2 or 3 Quarts of <HI>warm Water.</HI> And to force a Pa&s;&s;age, you mu&s;t take 2 or 3 Spoon|fuls of <HI>Bears Oyl,</HI> which will &s;eldom fail&punc; or el&s;e drink a Quarter of a Pint of the <HI>De|coction</HI> of <HI>Peach Leaves,</HI> with 2 Spoonfuls of <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blo&s;&s;oms:</HI> And this <HI>Purge</HI> you ought to repeat 2 or 3 Times, to car|ry off all Remains.

<P>THE Food proper in this Di&s;temper, is, <HI>Chicken,</HI> or <HI>Mutton Broth;</HI> and the Drink, <HI>Bawm Tea,</HI> &s;weeten'd with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Mallows.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="003843_0011_10026353D0B7D4B8">

<P>THE DRY GRIPES are now (ble&s;&s;ed be God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dry Gripes.</NOTE>) grown much rarer than formerly.

<P>IT makes it &s;elf known by a mo&s;t tor|menting Pain in the Pit of the Stomach, and the adjacent Parts. The Guts feel as if they were twi&s;ted, and all Motion down|ward is interrupted: By this Misfortune, the unhappy Patient is inclin'd to vomit up every Thing; in&s;omuch, that &s;ometimes his very Excrements are ca&s;t out at his Mouth. In the fir&s;t Place, a Thoroughfare mu&s;t by all Means be attempted, by 3 Spoonfuls of <HI>Bears Oyl,</HI> or by the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Peach Leaves,</HI> above mentioned.

<P>AFTER the Pa&s;&s;age is perfectly clear'd, your <HI>Diet,</HI> for &s;ome Days, ought to be ei|ther <HI>Mutton,</HI> or <HI>Chicken Broth,</HI> in which <HI>Mallows</HI> have been boil'd; and your Drink, <HI>Pawm Tea.</HI></P>
<P>SOME have unadvi&s;edly, in this Di&s;|temper, ventur'd al&s;o to drink Rum, and other Spirits, to ea&s;e their Pains; but this has co&s;t them dear, by taking away the U&s;e of their Hands; and other <HI>Paralytick</HI> Mi&s;|fortunes; to cure which, the &s;ame Reme|dies mu&s;t be u&s;ed, as are pre&s;crib'd hereaf|ter for the PALSEY.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t Way to prevent the DRY-GRIPES, is, to get rid of <HI>Agues,</HI> and <HI>Colicks,</HI> as &s;oon as you can; to eat &s;paring|ly of Fruit, and forbear all foul and windy Liquors; nor meddle with Rum, or other Spirit, after it has been poi&s;oned with foul Sugar, and Lime-juice.</P>

<P>THE Patient's Food &s;hould be dry, and of ea&s;y Dige&s;tion, with <HI>Mu&s;tard</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;e-Radi&s;h</HI> mixt with it; and let <HI>Sage,</HI> or <HI>Bawm Tea,</HI> be his con&s;tant Drink.</P>
<P>TO prevent this Di&s;temper, feed &s;eldom on &s;alt, or high &s;ea&s;on'd Di&s;hes; nor eat much Milk, or other flegmatick Food: Never &s;leep in the dangerous Dew, or on the moi&s;t Ground, or continue long in a Cellar, or other damp Situation.

<P>ANOTHER Di&s;ea&s;e of the Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epilep&s;y.</HI></NOTE> is, an EPILEPSY, or FALLING SICK|NESS, not unu&s;ual in this Country. It di&s;covers it &s;elf by very terrible Symptoms: The unhappy Per&s;on falls down &s;uddenly,

So &s;oon as the Fit is over, his Sen&s;es re|turn, but commonly a Pain in the Head, and great Depre&s;&s;ion of the Spirits, remain upon him for &s;ome Time after. The Re|turn of the&s;e melancholly Fits is uncertain, tho', for the mo&s;t Part, they come near the Full, or change of the Moon.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Place, Care &s;hould be ta|ken, to calm the Spirits of the Patient, and keep them from running Riot in this un|happy Manner. For that Intention, <HI>bleed</HI> him, and then burn Feathers often under his No&s;e, or el&s;e Leather, or the Hoofs of any Animal.</P>
<P>FOUR Days before the Full Moon, let him take a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Indian Phy&s;ick;</HI> and 4 Days after the Full Moon, let him take a <HI>Purge</HI> of the &s;ame; and be &s;ure to do the like again, before and after the Change: And this mu&s;t be repeated for Se|ven Months together.

IT would be difficult to pre&s;cribe Rules to prevent a Di&s;temper, to which our Situ|ation is &s;o unhappily &s;ubject: However, Prudence may be u&s;eful, even in this Ca&s;e.

ANOTHER woful Ca&s;e, is, a CAN|CER, which &s;ome de&s;pairingly imagine to be incurable; tho', ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, there have been &s;ome In&s;tances of Succe&s;s, by the Method hereafter mentioned. In the mean Time, it u&s;ually begins with little hard Lumps, or Swellings, in the Brea&s;t, Lip, or other glandulous Part of the Body. The&s;e afterwards break into painful Sores, which eat farther and farther, 'til at la&s;t, they reach &s;ome large Ve&s;&s;el, or mortal Part.</P>
<P>IN this Ca&s;e, the Patient mu&s;t &s;ubmit, in the fir&s;t Place, to have the hard Lump cut clean out, &s;o &s;oon as he is convinc'd it is a <HI>Cancer.</HI> And, for curing the Wound, he can't do better than make U&s;e of the following <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;am:</HI> He mu&s;t boil 6 Ounces of <HI>Sa&s;&s;afras Root,</HI> and as much <HI>Dogwood Root,</HI> in a <HI>Gallon</HI> of <HI>Water,</HI> 'til it be wa&s;t|ed to a <HI>Pint,</HI> and having &s;train'd it off, mu&s;t drench a <HI>Pledget</HI> therein, and apply it warm to the Sore, renewing it every Day: And if he will have the Patience to continue this for &s;ome Time, I can a&s;&s;ure him, he will not be the fir&s;t that has been ble&s;t with Succe&s;s.</P>

LET him drink <HI>Sa&s;&s;afras Tea</HI> every Morning, live temperately, upon light and innocent Food; and ab&s;tain intirely from &s;trong Liquor.</P>
<P>THE Way to prevent this Calamity, is, to be very &s;paring in eating Pork, to forbear all &s;alt, and high &s;ea&s;on'd Meats, and live chiefly upon the Garden, the Or|chard, and the Hen-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHALL clo&s;e this black Li&s;t of Di&s;ea&s;es with the GOUY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gouy.</NOTE> which I ob&s;erve with Plea&s;ure, to be grown le&s;s frequent in the Country, than in the Time of our Fa|thers.

<P>IT would be great Pre&s;umption, after &s;o many vain Attempts, for me to recom|mend any other Remedy for this ob&s;tinate Di&s;temper, than a &s;trict and &s;evere Tempe|rance, both in Eating, and Drinking. Ne|verthele&s;s, I am not &s;o hard-hearted, as to deny my Patient any Kind of fre&s;h and plain Food, that agrees with his Stomach: All I intreat of him, is, to confine him&s;elf

religiou&s;ly to a moderate Quantity. Nor can he do better, than to follow the Ex|ample of <HI>Cornaro,</HI> a noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> who tied him&s;elf down to 12 Ounces of Eata|bles, including Bread, and 14 Ounces of Drink, in the 24 Hours. He &s;tuck clo&s;e to this &s;hort Allowance, u&s;ing moderate Exerci&s;e; and, from being a Cripple by the <HI>Gout,</HI> recovered his Health, and his Strength, to a Wonder: And having found &s;o much Benefit by the&s;e Rules, pur&s;ued them &s;trictly to the End of a very long, and happy Life.</P>
<P>NOR are the&s;e Weights &s;o &s;canty as they may &s;eem to be, to &s;ome keen Stomachs; but, upon a fair Trial, they will be &s;ound &s;ufficient, to give Strength to the Body, Chearfulne&s;s to the Heart, and Vigour to all the Faculties of the Soul. And, be&s;ides the&s;e happy Effects, they will do more: They will place you above the Influence of the Stars; and make you able to &s;ubdue your Pa&s; &s;ions, to the Empire of a cool, and unclouded Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Temperance that cures this Di&s;temper, will certainly not fail to pre|vent it; make you live a great while, and very ea&s;y while you do live.</P>

THUS I have run through mo&s;t of the common Complaints, to which the inhabi|tants of this Colony are &s;ubject; and pre|&s;crib'd &s;uch innocent Cures, as will generally &s;ucceed, if timely made U&s;e of; yet am far from pretending, that any of them are in|fallible: We all know, that <HI>Death</HI> &s;trikes &s;o home in &s;ome Ca&s;es, that all <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> will be vain. There are many In&s;tances too, where the Di&s;ea&s;es of our Climate have a little <HI>Da&s;h</HI> of the <HI>Pox,</HI> the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> or the <HI>Gout;</HI> and then they need a <HI>RATCLIFF,</HI> or a <HI>FRIEND,</HI> to get the better of them.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, it may &s;eem &s;trange, that, among the Remedies I have pre&s;crib'd, no Mention is made of <HI>Mercury, Opium,</HI> or the <HI>Peruvian Bark,</HI> which have almo&s;t obtain'd the Reputation of <HI>Specificks.</HI> I acknowledge the powerful Effects of the&s;e Medicines; but am per&s;waded, they ought to be admini&s;tred with the greate&s;t Skill, and Di&s;cernment.

IF tho&s;e of better Circum&s;tances find any Thing here, that may in any Manner de&s;erve their Attention, I &s;hould be exceed|ingly glad: Tho' I own, the&s;e Directions were not de&s;igned for &s;uch as are in Con|dition to purcha&s;e more <HI>learned Advice.</HI> It was only to tho&s;e whom Fortune has pla|ced below the Regard of our <HI>Doctors,</HI> that I addre&s;s this &s;hort E&s;&s;ay: And if one &s;in|gle Per&s;on &s;hall be recovered thereby, or receive the lea&s;t Relief, I &s;hall account my Pains happily be&s;tow'd.</P>
