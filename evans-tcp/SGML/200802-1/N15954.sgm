<BIBL>COLOSSIANS, CHAP. I. VER. 19.</BIBL>
<Q>For it plea&s;ed the Father, that in him &s;hould all fulne&s;s dwell.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN &s;ome preceding ver&s;es of this chapter, St. Paul de&s;cribes the per&s;onal excellency and dignity of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his divine nature, and as the creator of the univer&s;e: <Q>Who is the image of the invi&s;ible God, the fir&s;t born of every creature: by whom were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him: he is before all things, and by him all things con&s;i&s;t.</Q> In the 18th ver&s;e, he con&s;iders the excellency of Chri&s;t's offices in the human nature, which he a&s;&s;umed into per&s;onal union with him&s;elf, not only as the political head of direction, authority and government, but al&s;o of vital influences, to communicate all &s;piritual life, nouri&s;h|ment, growth, and activity to every member of the church, "which is his body." The more evidently to &s;hew his &s;ufficiency for the&s;e glorious purpo&s;es, it is added in the words of our text, <Q>For it plea&s;ed the Father that in him &s;hould all fulne&s;s dwell.</Q> The word <HI>Father</HI> is not in the original, and perhaps the pa&s;&s;age may be ju&s;tly paraphra&s;ed thus: For it is the re&s;ult of eternal coun&s;el, that corre&s;pondent to the excellency of Chri&s;t's divine per&s;on, and the greatne&s;s of his mediatorial work, he &s;hould po&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s all fulne&s;s of gifts and qualifications, to render him a &s;aviour worthy of the mo&s;t unre&s;erved and perfect reliance of believers.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="020416_0004_0FAF04986C124D88">
It is certainly, among many others, a very powerful &s;upport of our confidence in the redeemer, that he exerci&s;es none of his offices, but under the &s;eal of divine appointment. The whole &s;cheme of &s;alvation is a device of infinite wi&s;dom: and Chri&s;t, the great high prie&s;t of the new covenant is, accordingly, cho&s;en from all eternity, to fulfil the gracious offices which he exerci&s;es in the recovery of &s;inners, and in accompli&s;hing their reconciliation to God.</P>
<P>From all eternity he was the <Q>elect of God, in whom his &s;oul delighteth; his &s;ervant whom he upholdeth, upon whom he putteth his &s;pirit, that he might &s;hew judgment to the Gentiles. He was &s;et up from everla&s;ting,&mdash;from the beginning, or ever the earth was: and he glorified not him&s;elf, to be made an high prie&s;t, but he that &s;aid unto him, Thou art my &s;on, to day have I begotten thee.</Q> And &s;o in the text Chri&s;t is not &s;elf-exalted in the all-&s;ufficiency which is committed to him as the head of the church; but by the decree of eternal wi&s;dom it is determined, that in "him &s;hould all fulne&s;s dwell.</P>
<P>As &s;ome of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious di&s;plays of this fulne&s;s are exhibited in the &s;preading and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the go&s;pel, in the enlarging of the borders of Zion, and in extending the means for bringing men to the know|ledge of &s;alvation, it will be a proper &s;ubject of meditation on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. In further treating of it, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew &s;ome of the mo&s;t important re&s;pects in which all fulne&s;s dwelleth in Chri&s;t, and then to lead to the &s;uitable application of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>1&s;t. I am to point out &s;ome of the mo&s;t important re&s;pects, in which all fulne&s;s dwelleth in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve here, that our text con&s;iders the Lord Je&s;us only in his mediatorial character, and &s;peaks not of the fulne&s;s which is e&s;&s;ential to his
<PB N="5" REF="020416_0005_0FAF049A25E08C68">
divine nature, but of that which is communicated to him as Me&s;&s;iah. As God indeed, he is <Q>over all ble&s;&s;ed forever,</Q> and by rea&s;on of the union of his two natures, <Q>all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily.</Q> The e&s;&s;ential perfections of deity are, in this re&s;pect, the &s;ame in him as in the Father and the Holy Gho&s;t: not depending on the divine decree, but co-e&s;&s;ential with his eternal exi&s;tence. For this rea&s;on <Q>his name is called wonderful, coun&s;ellor, and the mighty God, as well as the prince of peace,&mdash;his throne is forever and forever: and he counted it not robbery to be equal with God, for he is the true God.</Q></P>
<P>In re&s;pect, therefore, to his divine nature, di&s;tinctly con&s;idered, Chri&s;t hath all the fulne&s;s of infinite being, glory, ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and perfection, independent and underived.</P>
<P>But in his mediatorial offices, the &s;criptures repre&s;ent him as receiving his qualifications according to, and in con&s;equence of the divine appointment. Agreeably to which he declares his authority to publi&s;h the glad tidings of &s;alvation to guilty men: he claims it by virtue of the unction which he had received of the Father: <Q>The &s;pirit of the Lord is upon me, becau&s;e he hath anointed me to preach the go&s;pel to the poor: he hath &s;ent me to heal the broken hearted; to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of &s;ight to the blind; to &s;et at liberty them that are brui&s;ed.</Q> And when he te&s;tified the authority by which he fulfils all his offices in the character of the Me&s;&s;iah, he declared it not to be from him&s;elf, but by the direction of the Father: <Q>I can of mine own &s;elf do nothing: as I hear I judge, and my judgment is ju&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;eek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath &s;ent me.</Q> Yet in the character of mediator, con&s;idered as a &s;ubordinate character, all,
<PB N="6" REF="020416_0006_0FAF049BF64A4508">
even infinite fulne&s;s is committed to Chri&s;t, to be employed by him in accompli&s;hing the purpo&s;es of infinite mercy; and this fulne&s;s is more particularly exerci&s;ed and evidenced, in the</P>
<P>1&s;t place, in his almighty power:&mdash;It is a glory in Chri&s;t's character that he <Q>is mighty to &s;ave&mdash;that he can &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, them that come unto God by him.</Q></P>
<P>But barely to deliver the guilty from de&s;truction, is not the utmo&s;t of that illu&s;trious power which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth; nor indeed is it the utmo&s;t that divine grace hath intended &s;hould be exerci&s;ed for them that believe. In the great &s;cheme of redemption, the minute&s;t circum&s;tances of the &s;aints have been attended to, and all provi&s;ion is made for them during a weari&s;ome pilgrimage, as well as for their eternal &s;afety. They are liable to no changes, either in &s;piritual or temporal concerns, which are not fully under the control of the great high prie&s;t and captain of their &s;alvation: and for this purpo&s;e both nature and providence are &s;ubjected to his hand. In the days of his humiliation, he evidenced, in innumerable in&s;tances, the influence of his almighty power. The vi&s;ible and the invi&s;ible creation lay pro&s;trate at his feet. He di&s;po&s;ed and directed all the human faculties, both of body and mind, at his plea&s;ure. The mo&s;t inveterate di&s;ea&s;es yielded to his healing word. With ca&s;e he arre&s;ted the unruly elements, and bound or loo&s;ed them at his will. Death and the grave &s;ubmitted to his all-&s;ubduing dominion: and even apo&s;tate &s;pirits, hardened in their rebellion, trembled and confe&s;&s;ed his power. Nor was this only a temporary exerci&s;e of power, given to him as a te&s;timony of his heavenly de&s;cent and mi&s;&s;ion; but after his re&s;urrection, when all that was nece&s;&s;ary as a meritorious foundation for the redemption of his church was accompli&s;hed, he declared, for the everla&s;ting &s;upport of his humble
<PB N="7" REF="020416_0007_0FAF049D67E99B08">
followers, that all power was given to him in heaven and upon earth. And it is a con&s;ideration demanding attention, that this declaration peculiarly relates to his offices as Me&s;&s;iah. All things are put under him, and he reigneth until he &s;hall have put down all oppo&s;ing rule, authority and power; until all his enemies are put under his feet: he is gone into the highe&s;t heavens, <Q>and is on the right hand of God, having angels, authorities and powers made &s;ubject to him;</Q> and he hath entered into this &s;tate of exaltation, as head over all things to his church, to exerci&s;e a dominion for the benefit of his believing &s;ubjects. The &s;un, moon and &s;tars &s;hine not but by his command&mdash;the revolving &s;ea&s;ons continue, and are productive or unfruitful, healthful or noxious, according to his &s;overeign direction,&mdash;&s;tates and empires flouri&s;h, or are extingui&s;hed by his power alone. Nor is this all&mdash;the thoughts and actions of men are equally &s;ubjected to him: he &s;ucceeds or di&s;appoints the wi&s;dom of the prudent, as &s;hall be&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of his own government&mdash;he turns the hidden and intricate coun&s;els of the wicked into fooli&s;hne&s;s, and frequently cau&s;es their be&s;t concerted mea&s;ures to operate again&s;t them&s;elves; while on the other hand, neither the want of abilities or influence in the agents he is plea&s;ed to employ, can prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of any of his de&s;igns. If it is nece&s;&s;ary, <Q>he will give them a mouth and wi&s;dom, which all their adver&s;aries &s;hall not be able to gain&s;ay nor re&s;i&s;t;</Q> and if he chu&s;e it, <Q>the weak things of the world &s;hall confound the mighty, and the things which are not, bring to nought things which are.</Q> In fine, whether he worketh by vi&s;ible in&s;truments or without them, what&s;oever his will determines in heaven, or upon earth, his hand is able to perform.</P>
<P>But 2dly. Chri&s;t hath all fulne&s;s of authority as well as power. The plenitude of his power implies, indeed,
<PB N="8" REF="020416_0008_0FAF049E5DB3D220">
an authority to u&s;e it. It could not be a fulne&s;s of power&punc; if circum&s;cribed in its exerci&s;e, by the lea&s;t degree of limitation. And when we con&s;ider Chri&s;t's mediatorial power, we mu&s;t always conceive of it not as it exi&s;ts in him as an e&s;&s;ential attribute of his divine nature, but as delegated to him for the &s;pecial purpo&s;es for which he hath a&s;&s;umed the mediatorial character, which of con&s;equence includes authority; and accord|ingly all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which a&s;&s;ert Chri&s;t's power as the Me&s;&s;iah &s;peak of it as a moral, and not a natural faculty; and the &s;ame word is uniformly u&s;ed to expre&s;s it in the original, which is always u&s;ed to &s;ignify his authority: thus when he &s;aith, <Q>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again;</Q> and when he declareth, that <Q>the &s;on of man hath power on earth to forgive &s;ins,</Q> it is evident that it is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, I have authority to lay down my life and to take it again; and the &s;on of man hath authority on earth to forgive &s;ins. And &s;o when it is &s;aid, "he taught them as one having authority;" and when the <Q>chief prie&s;ts and the elders a&s;ked him, By what authority doe&s;t thou the&s;e things?</Q> u&s;ing the word in the above &s;ignification, we might read, he taught as one having power, and by what power doe&s;t thou the&s;e things? All authority then dwelleth in Chri&s;t; and not only is all ju&s;t and equitable authority on earth derived from him, as by him kings reign and princes decree ju&s;tice; but as king on the holy hill of Zion, the heavens as well as the earth are under his government&mdash;all the angels of God wor&s;hip and obey him&mdash;the heavenly ho&s;ts rejoice to do his plea&s;ure. And in the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame righteous dominion, he both governs the univer&s;e and gives laws to his church.&mdash;He appoints the &s;tation of every individual of its members; directs their peculiar circum&s;tances while in their pilgrim|age &s;tate; orders the mea&s;ure of their trials, calling
<PB N="9" REF="020416_0009_0FAF049E7B393970">
them forth, either to the &s;pecial exerci&s;e of their faith, hope and patience, under adver&s;ity and affliction; or of humility and thankfulne&s;s, in the experience of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing bounty. And he di&s;pen&s;es to all that propor|tion of grace and &s;piritual advantages which he determines to be be&s;t and mo&s;t expedient for them. In like manner he hath in&s;tituted the means of grace, and appointed the &s;everal ordinances of the go&s;pel, for the regular and orderly wor&s;hip of God; hath given the exact rule of faith, in all things that pertain to the glory of God, or the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls; and pre&s;cribed that rule of conduct, which is to be the guide of all our actions through the various changes of life. And finally, Chri&s;t will hereafter appear in all the glory of his authority, when, as &s;overeign and righteous judge of all the earth, <Q>he &s;hall de&s;cend from heaven with a &s;hout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God;&mdash;when all the tribes of the earth &s;hall &s;ee him coming in the clouds with power and great glory; and as the &s;on of man he &s;hall appear in his own glory, in the glory of the Father and of his holy angels;</Q>&mdash;when by the authority he hath received, he &s;hall fix the everla&s;ting condition of &s;aints and &s;inners; a&s;&s;igning to the one a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and receiving them to the kingdom of his Father; while the others &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting fire.</P>
<P>3d. Chri&s;t hath all fulne&s;s of wi&s;dom and grace. Omni&s;cience is his as God; and boundle&s;s wi&s;dom is given to him as mediator. It was a glorious prediction concerning him even in his lowly humiliation; <Q>The &s;pirit of the Lord &s;hall re&s;t upon him, the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, the &s;pirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.</Q> This prophecy was eminently fulfilled in the redeemer, who not only di&s;played the wi&s;dom and power of God in the qualifications of his per&s;on for the mediatorial offices,
<PB N="10" REF="020416_0010_0FAF049F39D8A7A0">
but had all the trea&s;ures of infinite wi&s;dom committed to him, as head of the church, for the u&s;e and benefit of the &s;aints: and though its influence is often beyond their comprehen&s;ion, and concealed from carnal minds, yet it is employed in conducting all the affairs of his kingdom, and all things that relate to their happine&s;s, either in the di&s;pen&s;ation of his providence or grace. And as infinite grace is combined with his un&s;peakable wi&s;dom; as he is ever touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and hath a &s;ympathy with his people under all their nece&s;&s;ities, and under all their temptations, it is impo&s;&s;ible that his power or authority &s;hould ever be mi&s;applied. He is acquainted with the circum&s;tances of every individual believer; knows how, and is di&s;po&s;ed &s;ea&s;onably to &s;upply all their wants &s;piritual or temporal, and &s;o to over-rule every occurrence of time to them, that at length they &s;hall &s;ee how he hath cau&s;ed light to &s;hine out of the ob&s;cure&s;t darkne&s;s; and that he is able to give them <Q>the oil of joy for mourning, and the garments of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s</Q> He di&s;cerns the &s;tate of his church at large, and not only hath power and a gracious di&s;po&s;ition to build up its intere&s;ts in the world, but hath wi&s;dom to direct all circum&s;tances relating to it; &s;o that his children &s;hall be gathered from all quarters of the globe, and none of them be left without the needful di&s;pen&s;ations of his grace.</P>

<P>Such, my brethren, is the fulne&s;s which dwelleth in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. You have this day an evidence of the gracious manner in which he conde&s;cends to exerci&s;e it, in his enabling you to open another hou&s;e for the honor of his name. This building will indeed be a la&s;ting monument of the zeal and a&s;&s;iduity of your
<PB N="11" REF="020416_0011_0FAF04A002E59F78">
former pa&s;tor, who&s;e active mind fir&s;t projected the plan, and with your concurrence, pur&s;ued it with unwearied application, until, by the convul&s;ed &s;tate of his country, he was interrupted in the de&s;ign, and &s;hortly after called from his labors here below into the joy of his Lord. Here, however, his memory &s;hall long &s;urvive and flouri&s;h; here new glories &s;hall be added to the crown of his immortality, while angels rejoice over tho&s;e, who from time to time are called to repentance in this &s;acred place; and here the name of TENNENT &s;hall be handed down, with endearment, to your children's children, to the late&s;t generations.</P>
<P>Upon you the ta&s;k devolved to fini&s;h the work, which at length you have thus far accompli&s;hed. Much credit is due to the cheerful piety you have expre&s;&s;ed, in pro&s;ecuting an undertaking of &s;uch utility; and with plea&s;ure I anticipate the days when you &s;hall obtain a mo&s;t grateful reward in the virtues of the ri&s;ing generation, who &s;hall here be in&s;tructed in the living principles of religion. But, to thee, O ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! to thee we are indebted for the di&s;po&s;ition and ability thou ha&s;t given thy &s;ervants to fulfil thy plea&s;ure. Of thy fulne&s;s have they received, and of thine own do they this day pre&s;ent an offering to thy name. Yes, my dear brethren! to Chri&s;t Je&s;us do you owe the honor of all that you have been able to perform: and &s;uffer me to remind you, that you are to depend upon him for all the benefits which you expect to ari&s;e from it in future. The means of grace with which you may be favored, are entirely at his di&s;po&s;al, and the &s;ucce&s;s of them wholly re&s;ts on his ble&s;&s;ing. He &s;aith to his &s;ervant go, and he goeth; and to another come, and he cometh. He walketh in the mid&s;t of the golden candle&s;ticks, his churches, to view their order, di&s;po&s;ition and nece&s;&s;ities. He holdeth his mini&s;ters in the right hand of his power, to place or di&s;place them at his
<PB N="12" REF="020416_0012_0FAF04A100A1FCC0">
plea&s;ure. He &s;heds his holy influence on their minds, and clothes them with light and &s;alvation, that they may be the happy in&s;truments of joy to his people:&mdash;or if his love be di&s;regarded, he turns away from his ungrateful &s;ubjects; and whatever outward means he may then leave them, they only &s;erve, through their own perver&s;ene&s;s, to render them the more blinded and hardened. As therefore, through your care and liberality, this new temple is erected for the advancement of the go&s;pel, I flatter my&s;elf you will not forget its pro&s;perity, in your daily &s;upplications at the throne of grace. And, with the ble&s;&s;ings that hereafter crown your devout intentions, may you ever be able to &s;ay, agreeably to the di&s;po&s;ition which I am per&s;uaded you now feel,&mdash;"Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glory!"&mdash;</P>
<P>And now permit me to conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, with a &s;hort addre&s;s to &s;uch of my hearers as expect to be of the congregation of &s;tated wor&s;hippers in this place. To you, my brethren, I hope the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion will be the introduction to many happy days of go&s;pel opportunities, which you &s;hall enjoy within the&s;e walls. Let it be your care to improve them, by a regular attendance, by diligently cultivating the know|ledge of the go&s;pel in your own minds, and by a &s;erious endeavour to reduce it to practice in your life and conver&s;ation. As a &s;ociety, ever &s;tudy the things which make for peace; and let your mo&s;t ardent emulation be to provoke unto love and good works. As indivi|duals, &s;trive to attain to the highe&s;t degrees of the chri&s;tian temper, not being forgetful hearers, but doers of the word; and evidencing, by a regular and decent deportment, that you mean not only to profe&s;s, but to lead a life of religion. Keep in view the example of Je&s;us, the great apo&s;tle and high prie&s;t of your profe&s;&s;ion, who hath left you an example that ye &s;hould follow his
<PB N="13" REF="020416_0013_0FAF04A19ABC3530">
&s;teps; and &s;tudy to know more and more of him, the knowledge of whom is life eternal, and to bring you to an acquaintance with whom is the proper end of all go&s;pel in&s;titutions. We have now &s;et out among you by proclaiming his adorable name, as the fountain of all power, authority, grace and wi&s;dom. I humbly hope you will make it a principal object of your future attention to know him as the author of redemption; and that tho&s;e doctrines will be mo&s;t acceptable to your minds, which favour mo&s;t of Je&s;us. Though you do not in this walk in the fa&s;hion of the wi&s;e of this world, you will find that Chri&s;t is the wi&s;dom of God and the power of God unto &s;alvation to them that believe; while you experience the happy influence of a &s;aving knowledge of his cro&s;s on the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of your &s;ouls, in &s;upporting your hope of immortality, in redeeming you from the pollutions of the world, in refining the &s;entiments of your hearts, and in meetening you for the happine&s;s of the heavenly &s;tate, to which you will finally be received, when the career of your attendance in the courts of God on earth &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, and you &s;hall know by happy experience, the efficacy of that infinite fulne&s;s, which dwelleth in the ever ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us:</P>
