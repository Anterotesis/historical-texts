<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHO is he among the children of the earth, that repines at the power of the wicked? and who is he, that would change the lot of the righte|ous? He, who has appointed to each his portion, is God; the Omni&s;cient and the Almighty, who fills eternity, and who&s;e exi&s;tence is from Him&s;elf! but he who murmurs is man; who ye&s;terday was not, and who to-morrow &s;hall be forgotten: let him li&s;ten in &s;ilence to the voice of knowledge, and hide the blu&s;hes of con|fu&s;ion in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Solyman, the mighty and the wife, who, in the one hundred and &s;econd
<PB N="6" REF="021881_0005_0FB752F908E4E6B8">
year of the Hegyra, &s;at upon the throne of Per&s;ia, had two &s;ons, ALMORAN and HAMET, and they were twins. ALMO|RAN was the fir&s;t born, but Solyman divided his affection equally between them: they were both lodged in the &s;ame part of the &s;eraglio, both were attended by the &s;ame &s;ervants, and both received in&s;tructions from the &s;ame teacher.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t things that ALMORAN leart, was the prerogative of his birth; and he was taught very early to &s;et a high value upon it, by the terms in which tho&s;e about him expre&s;&s;ed their &s;en&s;e of the power, the &s;plendor and the delights of royalty. As his mind gradually open|ed, he naturally con&s;idered the&s;e as the objects of univer&s;al de&s;ire, and the means of &s;upreme felicity: he was often re|minded, that the time was coming, when the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;overeign power would enable him to fulfil all his wi&s;hes, to determine the fate of dependent na|tions with a nod, and di&s;pen&s;e life and death, and happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, at his will: he was flattered by tho&s;e who ho|ped to draw wealth and dignity from his favour; and intere&s;t prompted all who
<PB N="7" REF="021881_0006_0FB752FC0D9157C8">
approached him, to admini&s;ter to his plea&s;ures with a zeal and a&s;&s;iduity, which had the appearance of reverence to his merit, and affection to his per&s;on.</P>
<P>HAMET, on the contrary, &s;oon be|came &s;en&s;ible of a &s;ubordinate &s;tation: he was not, indeed, neglected; but he was not much care&s;&s;ed. When the gra|tification of HAMET came in competi|tion with that of ALMORAN, he was al|ways obliged to give it up, except when Solyman interpo&s;ed: his mind was, therefore, naturally led to &s;eek for hap|pine&s;s in objects very different from tho&s;e which had &s;ixed the attention of ALMORAN. As he knew not to how narrow a &s;phere caprice or jealou&s;y might confine him, he con&s;idered what plea&s;ures were lea&s;t dependant upon ex|ternal advantages; and as the fir&s;t popu|lar commotion which &s;hould happen af|ter his brother's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, might probably co&s;t him his life, he was very inqui&s;itive about the &s;tate into which his &s;pirit would be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the Angel of Death, and very diligent to do whatever might &s;ecure him a &s;hare of the permanent and unchangeable fe|licity of Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="021881_0007_0FB753019F43E030">
This difference in the &s;ituation of AL|MORAN and HAMET, produced great di&s;&s;imilarity in their di&s;po&s;itions, habits, and characters; to which, perhaps, na|ture might al&s;o in &s;ome degree contribute. ALMORAN was haughty, vain, and vo|luptuous; HAMET was gentle, courte|ous, and temperate: ALMORAN was vo|latile, impetuous, and ira&s;cible; HAMET was thoughtful, patient, and forbearing. Upon the heart of HAMET al&s;o were written the in&s;tructions of the Prophet; to his mind futurity was pre&s;ent by ha|bitual anticipation; his plea&s;ure, his pain, his hopes, and his fears, were perpetually referred to the Invi&s;ible and Almighty Father of Life, by &s;en|timents of gratitude or re&s;ignation, complacency or confidence; &s;o that his devotion was not periodical but con&s;tant.</P>
<P>But the views of ALMORAN were terminated by nearer objects: his mind was perpetually bu&s;ied in the anticipa|tion of plea&s;ures and honours, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be neither uncertain nor remote; the&s;e excited his hopes, with a power &s;ufficient to fix his attention; he
<PB N="9" REF="021881_0008_0FB7530C634D9130">
did not look beyond them for other objects, nor enquired how enjoyments more di&s;tant were to be acquired; and as he &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e to be already &s;e|cured to him by his birth, there was nothing he was &s;olicitous to obtain as the reward of merit, nor any thing that he con&s;idered him&s;elf to po&s;&s;e&s;s as the bounty of Heaven. If the &s;ublime and di&s;intere&s;ted rectitude that produces and rewards it&s;elf, dwells indeed with man, it dwelt not with ALMORAN: with re&s;|pect to God, therefore, he was not im|pre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e either of duty or dependence; he felt neither reverence nor love, gratitude nor re&s;ignation: in ab&s;taining from evil, he was not inten|tionally good; he practi&s;ed the exter|nals of morality without virtue, and performed the rituals of devotion with|out piety.</P>
<P>Such were ALMORAN and HAMET, when Solyman their father, full of days and full of honour, &s;lept in peace the &s;leep of death. With this event they were immediately acquainted. The emotions of ALMORAN were &s;uch as it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal: the joy that
<PB N="10" REF="021881_0009_0FB7530FAEC5C140">
he felt in &s;ecret was &s;o great, that the mere dread of di&s;appointment, for a moment &s;u&s;pended his belief of what he heard: when his fears and his doubts gave way, his cheeks were &s;uffu&s;ed with &s;udden blu&s;hes, and his eyes &s;park|led with exultation and impatience: he looked eagerly about him, as if in ha&s;te to act; yet his looks were em|barra&s;&s;ed, and his ge&s;tures irre&s;olute, becau&s;e he knew not what to do: he uttered &s;ome incoherent &s;entences, which di&s;covered at once the joy that he felt, and his &s;en&s;e of its impropriety; and his whole deportment expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t tumult and perturbation of mind.</P>
<P>Upon HAMET, the death of his father produced a very different effect: as &s;oon as he heard it, his lips trembled and his countenance grew pale; he &s;tood mo|tionle&s;s a moment, like a pilgrim trans|fixed by lightning in the de&s;ert; he then &s;mote his brea&s;t, and looking upward, his eyes by degrees overflowed with tears, and they fell like dew di&s;tilling from the mountain, in a calm and &s;ilent &s;hower. As his grief was thus mingled with devotion, his mind in a &s;hort time
<PB N="11" REF="021881_0010_0FB7531112F437F8">
recovered its tranquillity, though not its chearfulne&s;s, and he de&s;ired to be conducted to his brother.</P>
<P>He found him &s;urrounded by the lords of his court, his eyes &s;till re&s;tle&s;s and ardent, and his deportment elate and a&s;&s;uming. HAMET pre&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily through the circle, and pro&s;trated him|&s;elf before him: ALMORAN received the homage with a tumultuous plea&s;ure; but at length rai&s;ed him from the ground, and a&s;&s;ured him of his protection, though without any expre&s;&s;ions either of kind|ne&s;s or of &s;orrow: <Q>HAMET, &s;ays he, if I have no cau&s;e to complain of you as a &s;ubject, you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to complain of me as a king.</Q> HAMET, who&s;e heart was again pierced by the cold and di&s;tant behaviour of his bro|ther, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the &s;ign that &s;truggled in his bo&s;om, and &s;ecretly wiped away the tear that &s;tarted to his eye: he re|tired with his looks fixed upon the ground, to a remote corner of the apart|ment; and though his heart yearned to embrace his brother, his mode&s;t diffi|dence re&s;trained him from intruding upon the king.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="021881_0011_0FB7531526472220">
In this &s;ituation were ALMORAN and HAMET, when OMAR entered the apart|ment. OMAR, upon who&s;e head the hand of time became heavy, had from his youth acquainted him&s;elf with wi&s;|dom: to him nature had revealed her|&s;elf in the &s;ilence of the night, when his lamp was burning alone, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> only were open: to him was known the power of the &s;eal of Solomon; and to him the knowledge of things invi&s;ible had been revealed. Nor was the vir|tue of OMAR inferior to his knowledge; his heart was a fountain of good, which though it flowed through innumerable &s;treams was never dry: yet was the virtue of OMAR cloathed with humility; and he was &s;till pre&s;&s;ing nearer to per|fection, by a devotion which though elevated was rational, and though regu|lar was warm. From the council of OMAR, Solyman had derived glory and &s;trength; and to him he had committed the education of his children.</P>
<P>When he entered the apartment, the croud, touched at once with reverence and love, drew back; every eye was ca&s;t downward, and every tongue was
<PB N="13" REF="021881_0012_0FB7531CD9F687B8">
&s;ilent. The full of days approached the king, and kneeling before him, he put into his hand a &s;ealed paper: the king received it with impatience, &s;eeing it &s;uper&s;cribed with the hand of his fa|ther; and OMAR looked round, and perceiving HAMET, beckoned him to come forward. HAMET, who&s;e obedi|ence to OMAR had been &s;o long habi|tual that it was now almo&s;t &s;pontaneous, in&s;tantly drew near, though with a &s;low and irre&s;olute pace; and ALMORAN, having broken the &s;eal of the paper, began to read it to him&s;elf, with a look that expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t anxiety and impatience. OMAR kept his eye fixed upon him, and &s;oon perceived that his countenance was disfigured by confu&s;ion and trouble, and that he &s;eemed prepa|ring to put up the paper in his bo&s;om: he then produced another paper from under his robe, and gave it to HAMET: <Q>This, &s;ays he, is a copy of the will of Solyman, your father; the original is in the hand of ALMORAN: read it, and you will find that he has bequeath|ed his kingdom between you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="021881_0013_0FB7531DD4212320">
The eyes of all pre&s;ent were now turned upon HAMET, who &s;tood &s;ilent and motionle&s;s with amazement, but was &s;oon rou&s;ed to attention by the homage that was paid him. In the mean time ALMORAN'S confu&s;ion en|crea&s;ed every moment: his di&s;appoint|ment was aggravated by the &s;udden at|tention of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent to his brother; and his jealou&s;y made him think him&s;elf neglected, while tho&s;e acts of duty were performed to HAMET, which were now known to be his right, and which he had him&s;elf received be|fore him.</P>
<P>HAMET, however, regarded but little what &s;o much excited the envy of AL|MORAN; his mind was employed upon &s;uperior objects, and agitated by nobler pa&s;&s;ions: the coldne&s;s of his brother's behaviour, though it had grieved had not quenched his affection; and as he was now no longer re&s;trained by the de|ference due from a &s;ubject to his king, he ran to him, and catching him to his brea&s;t attempted to &s;peak; but his heart was too full, and he cou'd expre&s;s his affection and joy only by his tears.
<PB N="15" REF="021881_0014_0FB7532528AEEEA8">
ALMORAN rather &s;uffered than received the embrace; and after a few ceremo|nies, to which neither of them could much attend, they retired to &s;eparate apartments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN ALMORAN was alone, he immediately locked the door; and throwing him&s;elf upon a &s;ofa in an agony of vexation and di&s;appointment, of which he was unwilling there &s;hould be any witne&s;s, he revolved in his mind all the plea&s;ures and honours of &s;upreme dominion which had now &s;uddenly been &s;natched from him, with a degree of an|gui&s;h and regret, not proportioned to their real, but their imaginary value. Of future good, that which we obtain is found to be le&s;s than our expectations; but that of which we are di&s;appointed, we &s;uppo&s;e would have been more: thus do the children of hope extract evil, both from what they gain, and from what they lo&s;e. But ALMORAN, after the fir&s;t tu|mult of his mind had &s;ub&s;ided, began to
<PB N="16" REF="021881_0015_0FB753270646EB18">
con&s;ider as well what was left him, as what had been taken away. He was &s;till without a &s;uperior, though he had an equal; he was &s;till a king, though he did not govern alone: and with re&s;pect to every individual in his dominions, ex|cept one, his will would now be a law; though with re&s;pect to the public, the concurrence of his brother would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give it force. <Q>Let me then, &s;ays he, make the mo&s;t of the power that is now put into my hand, and wait till &s;ome favourable opportunity &s;hall offer to encrea&s;e it. Let me di&s;&s;emble my jealou&s;y and di&s;appointment, that I may not alarm &s;u&s;picion, or put the virtues of HAMET upon their guard a|gain&s;t me; and let me contrive to give our joint admini&s;tration &s;uch a form, as may be&s;t favour my de&s;ign.</Q></P>
<P>Such were the reflections, with which ALMORAN &s;oothed the angui&s;h of his mind; while HAMET was bu&s;ied in &s;pe|culations of a very different kind. If he was plea&s;ed at reflecting, that he was rai|&s;ed from a &s;ubject to a prince; he was plea&s;ed &s;till more, when he con&s;idered his elevation as a te&s;t of his father's af|fection
<PB N="17" REF="021881_0016_0FB7532A74678700">
to his per&s;on, and approbation of his conduct: he was al&s;o delighted with the thought, that his brother was a&s;&s;ociated with him in the arduous ta&s;k which he was now called to perform. <Q>If I had been appointed to govern alone, &s;aid he, I &s;hould have had no equal; and he who has no equal, tho' he may have faithful &s;ervants, can have no friend: there cannot be that union of intere&s;t, that equal participation of good, that unre&s;trained intercour&s;e of mind, and that mutual dependence, which con&s;titutes the pure and exalted happine&s;s of friend&s;hip. With AL|MORAN, I &s;hall &s;hare the &s;upreme de|light of wre&s;ting the innocent and the helple&s;s from the iron hand of oppre&s;|&s;ion; of animating merit by reward, and re&s;training the unworthy by fear: I &s;hall &s;hare, with ALMORAN, the plea&s;ures of governing a numerous, a powerful, and a happy people; plea|&s;ures which, however great, are, like all others, increa&s;ed by participation.</Q></P>
<P>While HAMET was thus enjoying the happine&s;s, which his virtue derived from the &s;ame &s;ource, from which the vices of
<PB N="18" REF="021881_0017_0FB75302CDDBE5B8">
ALMORAN had filled his brea&s;t with an|gui&s;h and di&s;content; OMAR was contri|ving in what manner their joint govern|ment could be&s;t be carried into execution.</P>
<P>He knew that Solyman, having con|&s;idered the di&s;po&s;itions of his &s;ons, was of opinion, that if they had been blen|ded in one per&s;on, they would have produced a character more fit to govern in his &s;tead, than either of them alone: ALMORAN, he thought, was too volatile and warm; but he &s;u&s;pected, that HA|MET would &s;ink into inactivity for want of &s;pirit: he feared alike ALMORAN'S love of enterprize, and HAMET'S fond|ne&s;s for retirement: he ob&s;erved, in HAMET, a placid ea&s;ine&s;s of temper, which might &s;uffer the reins of govern|ment to lie too loo&s;e; and, in ALMO|RAN, a quickne&s;s of re&s;entment, and jealou&s;y of command, which might hold them too tight: he hoped, therefore, that by leaving them a joint dominion, he &s;hould blend their di&s;po&s;itions, at lea&s;t in their effects, in every act of go|vernment that &s;hould take place; or that, however they &s;hould agree to ad|mini&s;ter their government, the public
<PB N="19" REF="021881_0018_0FB7532B6057A9C0">
would derive benefit from the virtues of both, without danger of &s;uffering from their imperfections, as their imperfecti|ons would only operate again&s;t each other, while, in whatever was right, their minds would naturally concur, as the coincidence of rectitude with recti|tude, is nece&s;&s;ary and eternal. But he did not con&s;ider, that different di&s;po&s;i|tions operating &s;eparately upon two dif|ferent wills, would appear in effects very unlike tho&s;e, which they would concur to produce in one: that two wills, un|der the directions of di&s;po&s;itions &s;o dif|ferent, would &s;eldom be brought to co|incide; and that more mi&s;chiefs would probably ari&s;e from the conte&s;t, than from the imperfections of either alone.</P>
<P>But Solyman had &s;o long applauded him&s;elf for his project before he reveal|ed it to OMAR, that OMAR found him too much di&s;plea&s;ed with any objection, to con&s;ider its weight: and knowing that peculiar notions are more rarely given up, than opinions received from others, and made our own only by adop|tion, he at length acquie&s;ced, le&s;t he &s;hould by farther oppo&s;ition lo&s;e his in|fluence,
<PB N="20" REF="021881_0019_0FB7532CDE1D59C0">
which on other occa&s;ions he might &s;till employ to the advantage of the public; and took a &s;olemn oath, that he would, as far as was in his pow|er, &s;ee the will carried into execution.</P>
<P>To this, indeed he con&s;ented without much reluctance, as he had little le&s;s rea&s;on to fear the &s;ole government of ALMORAN, than a joint admini&s;tration; and if a &s;truggle for &s;uperiority &s;hould happen, he hoped the virtues of HAMET would obtain the &s;uffrages of the people in his favour, and e&s;tabli&s;h him upon the throne alone. But as change is it&s;elf an evil, and as changes in government are &s;eldom produced without great con|fu&s;ion and calamity, he applied him&s;elf to con&s;ider in what manner the government of ALMORAN and HAMET could be ad|mini&s;tered, &s;o as mo&s;t effectually to blend their characters in their admini&s;tration, and prevent the conduct of one from exciting jealou&s;y in the other.</P>
<P>After much thought, he determined that a &s;y&s;tem of laws &s;hould be prepared, which the &s;ons of Solyman &s;hould ex|amine and alter till they perfectly
<PB N="21" REF="021881_0020_0FB753362A123F98">
approved, and to which they &s;hould then give the &s;anction of their joint authori|ty: that when any addition or alteration &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;hould be made in the &s;ame manner; and that when any in&s;uperable difference of &s;en|timent happened, either in this or in any act of prerogative independent of the laws for regulating the manners of the people, the kings &s;hould refer it to &s;ome per&s;on of approved integrity and wi&s;|dom, and abide by his determination. OMAR ea&s;ily fore&s;aw, that when the opinion of ALMORAN and HAMET &s;hould differ, the opinion of ALMORAN would be e&s;tabli&s;hed; for there were many cau&s;es that would render ALMO|RAN inflexible, and HAMET yielding: ALMORAN was naturally confident and a&s;&s;uming, HAMET diffident and mode&s;t; ALMORAN was impatient of contradic|tion, HAMET was attentive to argument, and &s;olicitous only for the di&s;covery of truth. ALMORAN al&s;o conceived, that by the will of his father, he had &s;uffer|ed wrong; HAMET, that he had receiv|ed a favour: ALMORAN, therefore, was di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;ent the fir&s;t appearance
<PB N="22" REF="021881_0021_0FB7533816E54C30">
of oppo&s;ition; and HAMET, on the con|trary, to acquie&s;ce, as in his &s;hare of government, whatever it might be, he had more than was his right by birth, and his brother had le&s;s. Thus, there|fore, the will of ALMORAN would pro|bably predominate in the &s;tate: but as the &s;ame cau&s;e which conferred this &s;u|periority, would often prevent conten|tion, OMAR con&s;idered it, upon the whole, rather as good than evil.</P>
<P>When he had prepared his plan, there|fore, he &s;ent a copy of it, by different me&s;&s;engers at the &s;ame time, both to AL|MORAN and HAMET, inclo&s;ed in a let|ter in which he expre&s;t his &s;en&s;e of ob|ligation to their father, and his zeal and affection for them: he mentioned the promi&s;e he had made, to devote him&s;elf to their &s;ervice; and the oath he had ta|ken, to propo&s;e whatever he thought might facilitate the accompli&s;hment of their father's de&s;ign, with honor to them and happine&s;s to their people: the&s;e motives, which he could not re&s;i&s;t with|out impiety, he hoped would ab&s;olve him from pre&s;umption; and tru&s;ting in the rectitude of his intentions, he left the i&s;&s;ue to God.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE receipt of this letter threw ALMORAN into another agony of indignation: he felt again the lo&s;s of his prerogative; the offer of advice he di&s;dained as an in&s;ult, to which he had been injuriou&s;ly &s;ubjected by the will of his father; and he was di&s;po&s;ed to reject whatever was &s;ugge&s;ted by OMAR, even before his propo&s;al was known. With this temper of mind he began to read, and at every paragraph took new offence; he determined, however, not to admit OMAR to the honour of a conference upon the &s;ubject, but to &s;et|tle a plan of government with his bro|ther, without the lea&s;t regard to his advice.</P>
<P>A &s;upercilious attention to minute formalities, is a certain indication of a little mind, con&s;cious to the want of innate dignity, and &s;olicitous to derive from others what it cannot &s;upply to it|&s;elf: as the &s;crupulous exaction of eve|ry trifling tribute di&s;covers the weakne&s;s of the tyrant, who fears his claim &s;hould
<PB N="24" REF="021881_0023_0FB7534002EA8D30">
be di&s;puted; while the prince, who is con&s;cious of &s;uperior and indi&s;putable power, and knows that the &s;tates he has &s;ubjugated do not dare to revolt, &s;carce enquires whether &s;uch te&s;timonies of allegiance are given or not.</P>
<P>Thus, the jealou&s;y of ALMORAN al|ready en&s;laved him to the punctilios of &s;tate; and the mo&s;t trifling circum|&s;tances involved him in perplexity, or fired him with re&s;entment: the friend|&s;hip and fidelity of OMAR &s;tung him with rage, as in&s;olent and intru&s;ive; and though it determined him to an immedi|ate interview with his brother, yet he was embarra&s;&s;ed how to procure it. At fir&s;t he ro&s;e, and was about to go to him; but he &s;topped &s;hort with di&s;dain, upon reflecting, that it was an act of conde|&s;cen&s;ion which might be deemed an ac|knowledgement of &s;uperiority: he then thought of &s;ending for HAMET to come to him; but this he feared might pro|voke him, as implying a denial of his equality: at length he determined to propo&s;e a meeting in the chamber of council, and was ju&s;t di&s;patching an offi|cer with the me&s;&s;age, when HAMET en|tered the apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="021881_0024_0FB75341B4206BE0">
The countenance of HAMET was flu&s;h|ed with joy, and his heart was warmed with the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations of affection and confidence, by the &s;ame letter, from which ALMORAN had extracted the bit|terne&s;s of jealou&s;y and re&s;entment; and as he had no idea that an act of courte|&s;y to his brother could derogate from his own dignity or importance, he indulged the hone&s;t impatience of his heart to communicate the plea&s;ure with which it overflowed: he was, indeed, &s;omewhat di&s;appointed, to find no traces of &s;atis|faction in the countenance of ALMO|RAN, when he &s;aw the &s;ame paper in his hand, which had impre&s;&s;ed &s;o much up|on his own.</P>
<P>He waited &s;ome time after the fir&s;t &s;a|lutations, without mentioning the &s;cheme of government he was come to concert; becau&s;e having ob&s;erved that ALMO|RAN was embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;plea&s;ed, he expected that he would communicate the cau&s;e, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the hope that he might remove it: finding, how|ever, that this expectation was di&s;ap|pointed, he addre&s;&s;ed him to this effect.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021881_0025_0FB75344DA2EC240">
<Q>How happy are we, my dear bro|ther, in the wi&s;dom and fidelity of O|MAR! how excellent is the &s;y&s;tem of government that he has propo&s;ed! how ea&s;y and honourable will it be to us that govern, and how advantageous to the people that obey!</Q></P>
<P><Q>The advantages, &s;aid ALMORAN, which you &s;eem to have di&s;covered, are not evident to me: tell me, then, what you imagine they are, and I will afterwards give you my opinion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;y&s;tem of laws as the rule of government, &s;aid HAMET, many evils will be avoided, and many benefits procured. If the law is the will only of the &s;overeign, it can never certainly be known to the people:&mdash;many, therefore, may violate that rule of right, which the hand of the Al|mighty has written upon the living ta|blets of the heart, in the pre&s;umptuous hope, that it will not &s;ubject them to puni&s;hment; and tho&s;e, by whom that rule is fulfilled, will not enjoy that con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ecurity, which they would derive from the protection of a pre&s;cri|bed
<PB N="27" REF="021881_0026_0FB7534682E01968">
law, which they have never bro|ken. Neither will tho&s;e who are in|clined to do evil, be equally re&s;train|ed by the fear of puni&s;hment; if nei|ther the offence is a&s;certained, nor the puni&s;hment pre&s;cribed. One motive to probity, therefore, will be wanting; which ought to be &s;upplied, as well for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who may be tempted to offend, as of tho&s;e who may &s;uffer by the offence. Be&s;ides, he who go|verns not by a written and a public law, mu&s;t either admini&s;ter that go|vernment in per&s;on, or by others: if in per&s;on, he will &s;ink under a labour which no man is able to &s;u&s;tain; and if by others, the inferiority of their rank mu&s;t &s;ubject them to temptations which it cannot be hoped they will al|ways re&s;i&s;t, and to prejudices which it will perhaps be impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;urmount. But to admini&s;ter govern|ment by a law which a&s;certains the offence, and directs the puni&s;hment, integrity alone will be &s;ufficient; and as the perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice will in this ca&s;e be notorious, and depend not upon opinion but fact, it will &s;eldom be practi&s;ed, becau&s;e it will be ea&s;ily puni&s;hed.</Q></P>

ALMORAN, who had heard the opi|nions of HAMET with impatience and &s;corn, now &s;tarted from his &s;eat with a proud and contemptuous a&s;pect: he fir&s;t glanced his eyes upon his bro|ther; and then looking di&s;dainfully downward, he threw back his robe, and &s;tretching out his hand from him, <Q>Shall the &s;on of Solyman, &s;aid he, upon who&s;e will the fate of nations was &s;u&s;pended, who&s;e &s;miles and frowns were alone the criterions of right and wrong, before whom the voice of wi&s;|dom it&s;elf was &s;ilent, and the pride even of virtue humbled in the du&s;t; &s;hall the &s;on of Solyman be harne&s;&s;ed, like a mule, in the tramels of law? &s;hall he become a mere in&s;trument to execute what others have devi&s;ed? &s;hall he only declare the determinati|ons of a &s;tatute, and &s;hall his ear be affronted by claims of right? It is the glory of a prince, to puni&s;h for what and whom he will; to be the &s;overeign, not only of property, but of life; and to govern alike without pre&s;cription or appeal.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="021881_0028_0FB7534E8EC8F920">
HAMET, who was &s;truck with a&s;to|ni&s;hment at this declaration, and the vehemence with which it was uttered, after a &s;hort recollection made this re|ply: <Q>It is the glory of a prince, to govern others, as he is governed by Him, who is alone mo&s;t merciful and almighty! It is his glory to prevent crimes, rather than to di&s;play his pow|er in puni&s;hment; to diffu&s;e happine&s;s, rather than enforce &s;ubjection; and rather to animate with love, than de|pre&s;s by fear. Has not He that &s;hall judge us, given us a rule of life by which we &s;hall be judged? is not our reward and puni&s;hment already &s;et before us? are not his promi&s;es and threatnings, motives to obedience? and have we not confidence and joy, when we have obeyed? To God, His own divine perfections are a law; and the&s;e he has tran&s;cribed as a law to us. Let us, then, govern, as we are governed; let us &s;eek our happine&s;s, in the happi|ne&s;s that we be&s;tow, and our honour in emulating the benevolence of Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>As ALMORAN feared, that to proceed farther in this argument would too far
<PB N="30" REF="021881_0029_0FB75351B112ED60">
di&s;clo&s;e his &s;entiments, and put HAMET too much upon his guard; he deter|mined for the pre&s;ent to di&s;&s;emble: and as he perceived, that HAMET'S opinion, and an admini&s;tration founded upon it, would render him extremely popular, and at length po&s;&s;ibly e&s;tabli&s;h him a|lone; he was now &s;olicitous only to withdraw him from public notice, and per&s;uade him to leave the government, whatever form it &s;hould receive, to be admini&s;tered by others: returning there|fore, to his feat, and a&s;&s;uming an ap|pearance of complacence and tranquil|lity, with which he could not form his language perfectly to agree; <Q>Let us then, &s;aid he, if a law mu&s;t be &s;et up in our &s;tead, leave the law to be exe|cuted by our &s;laves: and as nothing will be left for us to do, that is worthy of us, let us devote our&s;elves to the plea&s;ures of ea&s;e; and if there are any enjoyments peculiar to royalty, let us &s;ecure them as our only di&s;tinction from the multitude.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not &s;o, &s;ays HAMET; for there is yet much for a prince to do, after the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of laws has been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed:
<PB N="31" REF="021881_0030_0FB753530EA51988">
the government of a nation as a whole, the regulation and extent of its trade, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of ma|nufactories, the encouragement of ge|nius, the application of the revenues, and whatever can improve the arts of peace, and &s;ecure &s;uperiority in war, is the proper object of a king's atten|tion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But in the&s;e, &s;aid ALMORAN, it will be difficult for two minds to con|cur; let us, then, agree to leave the&s;e al&s;o to the care of &s;ome other, whom we can continue as long as we approve, and di&s;place when we approve no lon|ger: we &s;hall, by this expedient, be able to avert the odium of any popular mea&s;ure; and by the &s;acrifice of a &s;lave, we can always &s;atisfy the people, and &s;ilence public di&s;content.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To tru&s;t implicity to another, &s;ays HAMET, is to give up a prerogative, which is at once our highe&s;t duty and intere&s;t to keep; it is to betray our tru&s;t, and to &s;acrifice our honour to another. The prince, who leaves the government of his people implicitly to
<PB N="32" REF="021881_0031_0FB753548C8D6CB8">
a &s;ubject, leaves it to one, who has many more temptations to betray their intere&s;t than him&s;elf: a vicegerent is in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation; he has, there|fore, much to fear, and much to hope: he may al&s;o acquire the power of ob|taining what he hopes, and averting what he fears, at the public expence; he may &s;tand in need of dependants, and may be able no otherwi&s;e to pro|cure them, than by conniving at the fraud or violence which they commit: he may receive, in bribes, an equiva|lent for his &s;hare, as an individual, in the public pro&s;perity; for his intere&s;t is not e&s;&s;entially connected with that of the &s;tate; he has a &s;eparate intere&s;t; but the intere&s;t of the &s;tate, and of the king, are one: he may even be cor|rupted to betray the councils, and give up the intere&s;ts of the nation, to a foreign power; but this is impo&s;&s;ible to the king; for nothing equivalent to what he would give up, could be offer|ed him. But as a king has not equal temptations to do wrong, neither is he equally expo&s;ed to oppo&s;ition, when he does right: the mea&s;ures of a &s;ub&s;titute
<PB N="33" REF="021881_0032_0FB7535D14DBC860">
are frequently oppo&s;ed, merely from intere&s;t; becau&s;e the leader of a faction again&s;t him, hopes, that if he can re|move him by popular clamour, he &s;hall &s;ucceed to his power; but it can be no man's intere&s;t to oppo&s;e the mea|&s;ures of a king, if his mea&s;ures are good, becau&s;e no man can hope to &s;upplant him.

<P><Q>But is the prince, &s;aid ALMORAN, always the wi&s;e&s;t man in his dominions? Can we not find, in another, abilities and experience, which we do not po&s;|&s;e&s;s? and is it not the duty of him who pre&s;ides in the &s;hip, to place the helm in that hand which can be&s;t &s;teer it?</Q></P>
<P><Q>A prince, &s;aid HAMET, who &s;in|cerely intends the good of his people,

Let us then, hear others; but let us act our&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>As ALMORAN now perceived, that the longer this conver&s;ation continued, the more he &s;hould be embarra&s;&s;ed; he put an end to it, by appearing to acqui|e&s;ce in what HAMET had propo&s;ed. HAMET withdrew, charmed with the candour and flexibility which he ima|gined he had di&s;covered in his brother&punc; and not without &s;ome exultation in his own rhetoric, which he &s;uppo&s;ed had gained no incon&s;iderable victory. AL|MORAN, in the mean time, applauded him&s;elf for having thus far practi&s;ed the arts of di&s;&s;imulation with &s;ucce&s;s; for|tified him&s;elf in the re&s;olutions he had before taken; and conceived new ma|levolence and jealou&s;y again&s;t HAMET.</P>

<P>WHILE HAMET was exulting in his conque&s;t, and his heart was overflowing at once with &s;elf-compla|cency, and affection to his brother; he was told that OMAR was waiting with|out, and de&s;ired admittance. HAMET ordered that he &s;hould be immediately introduced; and when OMAR entered, and would have pro&s;trated him&s;elf be|fore him, he catched him in his arms in a tran&s;port of affection and e&s;teem; and having ordered that none &s;hould inter|rupt them, compelled him to &s;it down on a &s;ofa.</P>
<P>He then related with all the joy of a youthful and an ardent mind, the con|ver&s;ation he had had with ALMORAN, intermixed with expre&s;&s;ions of the high|e&s;t prai&s;e and the mo&s;t cordial e&s;teem. OMAR was not without &s;u&s;picion, that the &s;entiments which ALMORAN had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> pa&s;&s;ion, were &s;till predominant in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mind; but of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions he did not give the lea&s;t hint to HAMET; not

only becau&s;e to communicate &s;u&s;picions is to accu&s;e without proof, but becau&s;e he did not think him&s;elf at liberty to make an ill report of another, though he knew it to be true. He approved the &s;entiments of HAMET, as they had been infu&s;ed by his own in&s;tructions; and &s;ome precepts and cautions were now added, which the acce&s;&s;ion of HA|MET to a &s;hare of the imperial power made particularly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><Q>Remember, &s;aid OMAR, that the mo&s;t effectual way of promoting virtue, is to prevent occa&s;ions of vice. There are, perhaps, particular &s;ituations, in which human virtue has always failed: at lea&s;t, temptation often repeated, and long continued, has &s;eldom been fi|nally re&s;i&s;ted. In a government &s;o con&s;tituted as to leave the people ex|po&s;ed to perpetual &s;eduction, by op|portunities of di&s;&s;olute plea&s;ure or in|iquitious gain, the multiplication of pe|nal laws will only tend to depopulate the kingdom, and di&s;grace the &s;tate; to devote to the cymitar and the bow|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ring, tho&s;e who might have been u&s;e|ful to &s;ociety, and to leave the re&s;t

di&s;&s;olute, turbulent and factious. If the &s;treets not only abound with wo|men, who inflame the pa&s;&s;enger by their appearance, their ge&s;ture, and their &s;olicitations; but with hou&s;es, in which every de&s;ire which they kindle may be gratified with &s;ecrecy and con|venience; it is in vain that <Q>the feet of the pro&s;titute go down to death, and that her &s;teps take hold on hell:</Q> what then can be hoped from any pu|ni&s;hment, which the laws of man can &s;uperadd to di&s;ea&s;e and want, to rotten|ne&s;s and perdition? If you permit opi|um to be publickly &s;old at a low rate; it will be folly to hope, that the dread of puni&s;hment will render idlene&s;s and drunkenne&s;s &s;trangers to the poor. If a tax is &s;o collected, as to leave oppor|tunities to procure the commodity, without paying it; the hope of gain will always &s;urmount the fear of pu|ni&s;hment. If, when the veteran has &s;erved you at the ri&s;que of life, you withhold his hire; it will be in vain to threaten u&s;ury and extortion with im|pri&s;onment and &s;ines. If, in your ar|mies, you &s;uffer it to be any man's in|tere&s;t,

<P>IN the mean time, the &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment was e&s;tabli&s;hed which had been propo&s;ed by OMAR, and in which HAMET concurred from principle, and ALMORAN from policy The views of ALMORAN terminated in the gratifica|tion of his own appetites and pa&s;&s;ions; tho&s;e of HAMET, in the di&s;charge of his duty: HAMET, therefore, was indefati|gable in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate; and as his &s;en&s;e of honour, and his love of the public, made this the employment of his choice, it was to him the perpetual &s;ource of a generous and &s;ublime feli|city.

<P>To atone for this wa&s;te of time, he de|termined to crowd all that remained with delight: his gardens were an epitome

of all nature, and on his palace were exhau&s;ted all the trea&s;ures of art; his &s;eraglio was filled with beauties of every nation, and his table &s;upplied with dain|ties from the remote&s;t corners of his do|minions. In the &s;ongs that were repeat|ed in his pre&s;ence, he li&s;tened at once to the voice of adulation and mu&s;ic; he breathed the perfumes of Arabia, and he ta&s;ted the forbidden plea&s;ure of wine. But as every appetite is &s;oon &s;atiated by exce&s;s, his eagerne&s;s to accumulate plea|&s;ure deprived him of enjoyment. A|mong the variety of beauty that &s;ur|rounded him, the pa&s;&s;ion, which, to be luxurious, mu&s;t be delicate and refined, was degraded to a mere in&s;tinct, and ex|hau&s;ted in endle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation; the ca|re&s;s was unendeared by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of reciprocal delight, and was immedi|ately &s;ucceeded by indifference or di&s;|gu&s;t. By the dainties that perpetually urged him to intemperance, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could make even dain|ties ta&s;teful, was de&s;troyed.

Even flattery and mu&s;ic lo&s;t their power, by too fre|quent a repetition: and the broken &s;lum|bers of the night, and the languor of the morning, were more than equivalent to the tran&s;ient hilarity that was in&s;pired by wine. Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time of AL|MORAN, divided between painful labors which he did not dare to &s;hun, and the &s;earch of plea&s;ure which he could never find.</P>
<P>HAMET, on the contrary, did not &s;eek plea&s;ure, but plea&s;ure &s;eemed to &s;eek him: he had a perpetual complacence and &s;erenity of mind, which rendered him con&s;tantly &s;u&s;ceptible of plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ions; every thing that was pre|pared to refre&s;h or entertain him in his &s;ea&s;ons of retirement and relaxation, added &s;omething to the delight which was continually &s;pringing in his brea&s;t, when he reviewed the pa&s;t, or looked forward to the future. Thus, the plea|&s;ures of &s;en&s;e were heightened by tho&s;e of his mind, and the plea&s;ures of the mind by tho&s;e of &s;en&s;e: he had, indeed, as yet no wi&s;e; for as yet no woman had fixed his attention, or determined his choice.</P>

Abdallah had only one child, a daughter, in whom all his happine&s;s and affection centered; he was unwilling to leave her behind, and therefore brought her to the court of Per&s;ia. Her mother died while &s;he was yet an infant; &s;he was now in the &s;ixteenth year of her age, and her name was ALMEDIA.

<P>Having ha&s;tily ordered the guard of the night to a&s;&s;i&s;t in quenching the flame, and removing the furniture, he ran him|&s;elf into the garden. As &s;oon as he was come up to the hou&s;e, he was alarm|ed by the &s;hrieks of a female voice; and the next moment, ALMEDIA ap|peared at the window of an apartment directly over that which was on fire. ALMEDIA he had till now never &s;een, nor did he &s;o much as know that Ab|dallah had a daughter: but though her per&s;on was unknown, he was &s;trongly intere&s;ted in her danger, and called out to her to throw her&s;elf into his arms. At the found of his voice &s;he ran back into the room, &s;uch is the force of in|violate

violate mode&s;ty, though the &s;moke was then ri&s;ing in curling &s;pires from the windows: &s;he was, however, &s;oon dri|ven back; and part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">or at the &s;ame in&s;tant giving way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he wrapt her veil round her, and leaped into the gar|den. HAMET caught her in his arms; but though he broke her fall, he &s;unk down with her weight: he did not, how|ever, quit his charge; but perceiving &s;he had fainted, he made ha&s;te with her into his apartment, to afford her &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as he could procure.</P>
<P>She was covered only with the light and loo&s;e robe in which &s;he &s;lept, and her veil had dropped off by the way. The moment he entered his clo&s;et, the light di&s;covered to him &s;uch beauty as before he had never &s;een: &s;he now be|gan to revive; and before her &s;en&s;es returned, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed the prince with an involuntary embrace, which he returned by &s;training her clo&s;er to his brea&s;t, in a tumult of delight, confu&s;ion, and anx|iety, which he could &s;carce &s;u&s;|tain. As he &s;till held her in his arms, and gazed &s;ilently upon her, &s;he opened her eyes, and in&s;tantly relinqui&s;hing her

hold, &s;hrieked out, and threw her&s;elf from him. As there were no women nearer than that wing of the palace in which his brother re&s;ided, and as he had many rea&s;ons not to leave her in their charge; he was in the utmo&s;t per|plexity what to do. He a&s;&s;ured her, in &s;ome ha&s;ty and incoherent words, of her &s;ecurity; he told her, that &s;he was in the royal palace, and that he who had conveyed her thither was HAMET. The habitual reverence of &s;overeign power, now &s;urmounted all other pa&s;&s;i|ons in the bo&s;om of ALMEDIA: &s;he was in&s;tantly covered with new confu|&s;ion: and hiding her face with her hands, threw her&s;elf at his feet: he rai|&s;ed her with a trepidation almo&s;t equal to her own, and endeavoured to &s;ooth her into confidence and tranquillity.</P>
<P>Hitherto her memory had been whol|ly &s;u&s;pended by violent pa&s;&s;ions, which had crowded her in a rapid and unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the fir&s;t gleam of recollection threw her into a new agony; and having been &s;ilent a few moments, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;mote her hands together, and bur&s;ting into tears, cried

out, 'Abdallah! my father! my father!'&mdash;HAMET not only knew but felt all the meaning of the exclamation, and immediately ran again into the garden: he had advanced but few paces, before he di&s;cerned an old man &s;itting on the ground, and looking upward in &s;ilent angui&s;h, as if he had exhau&s;ted the pow|er of complaint. HAMET, upon a near|er approach, perceived by the light of the flame that it was Abdallah; and in|&s;tantly calling him by his name, told him, that his daughter was &s;afe. At the name of his daughter, Abdallah &s;ud|denly &s;tarted up, as if he had been rou|&s;ed by the voice of an angel from the &s;leep of death: HAMET again repeated, that his daughter was in &s;afety; and Abdallah looking wi&s;tfully at him, knew him to be the king. He was then &s;truck with an awe that re&s;trained him from enquiry: but HAMET directing him where he might find her, went for|ward that he might not le&s;&s;en the plea|&s;ure of their interview, nor re&s;train the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of duty and affection by his pre&s;ence. He &s;oon met with other fugitives from the fire, which had open|ed

a communication between the gar|dens and the &s;treet; and among them &s;ome women belonging to ALMEDIA, whom he conducted him&s;elf to their mi&s;tre&s;s. He immediately allotted to her and to her father, an apartment in his divi&s;ion of the palace; and the fire being now nearly extingui&s;hed, he re|tired to re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the night was far ad|vanced, yet the eyes of HAMET were &s;trangers to &s;leep: his fancy ince&s;|&s;antly repeated the events that had ju&s;t happened; the image of ALMEIDA was ever before him; and his brea&s;t throb|bed with a di&s;quietude, which, though it prevented re&s;t, he did not wi&s;h to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, in the mean time, was &s;lumbering away the effects of his intem|perance; and in the morning, when he was told what had happened, he expre&s;|&s;ed no pa&s;&s;ion but curio&s;ity: he went ha&s;tily into the garden; but when he had
<PB N="48" REF="021881_0047_0FB753884DF0C190">
gazed upon the ruins, and enquired how the fire began, and what it had con&s;u|med, he thought of it no more.</P>
<P>But HAMET &s;uffered nothing that re|garded him&s;elf to exclude others from his attention: he went again to the ru|ins, not to gratify his curio&s;ity, but to &s;ee what might yet be done to alleviate the mi&s;ery of the &s;ufferers, and &s;ecure for their u&s;e what had been pre&s;erved from the flames. He found that no life had been lo&s;t, but that many per&s;ons had been hurt; to the&s;e he &s;ent the phy&s;ici|ans of his own hou&s;hold: and having rewarded tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in their di&s;tre&s;s, not forgetting even the &s;oldiers who had only fulfilled his own orders, he returned, and applied him|&s;elf to di&s;patch the public bu&s;ine&s;s in the chamber of council, with the &s;ame pa|tient and diligent attention as if nothing had happened. He had, indeed, order|ed enquiry to be made after ALMEIDA; and when he returned to his apartment, he &s;ound Abdallah waiting to expre&s;s his gratitude for the obligations he had re|ceived.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="021881_0048_0FB75390DC446788">
HAMET accepted his acknowledge|ments with a peculiar plea&s;ure, for they had &s;ome connexion with ALMEIDA; after whom he again enquired, with an ardour uncommon even to the benevo|lence of HAMET. When all his que&s;|tions had been a&s;ked and an&s;wered, he appeared &s;till unwilling to di&s;mi&s;s Ab|dallah, though he &s;eemed at a lo&s;s how to detain him; he wanted to know, whe|ther his daughter had yet received an offer of marriage, though he was unwil|ling to di&s;cover his de&s;ire by a direct enquiry: but he &s;oon found, that no|thing could be known, which was not directly a&s;ked, from a man whom reve|rence and humility kept &s;ilent before him, except when &s;omething was &s;aid which amounted to a command to &s;peak. At length, however, he &s;aid, not with|out &s;ome he&s;itation, <Q>Is there no one, Abdallah, who will thank me for the pre&s;ervation of thy daughter, with a zeal equal to thy own?</Q> <Q>Yes, replied Abdallah, that daughter whom thou ha&s;t pre&s;erved.</Q> This reply, though it was unexpected, was plea&s;ing: for HAMET was not only gratified to hear,
<PB N="50" REF="021881_0049_0FB75392174CC478">
that ALMEIDA had expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf warmly in his behalf, at lea&s;t as a bene|factor; but he judged, that if any man had been intere&s;ted in her life as a lo|ver, the an&s;wer which Abdallah had gi|ven him would not &s;o readily have oc|curred to his mind.</P>
<P>As this reflection kept HAMET a few moments &s;ilent, Abdallah withdrew; and HAMET, as he ob&s;erved &s;ome marks of ha&s;te and confu&s;ion in his counte|nance, was unwilling longer to continue him in a &s;ituation, which he had now rea|&s;on to think gave him pain. But Ab|dallah, who had conceived a &s;udden thought that HAMET'S que&s;tion was an indirect reproach of ALMEIDA, for not having her&s;elf &s;olicited admi&s;&s;ion to his pre&s;ence; went in ha&s;te to her apart|ment, and ordered her immediately to make ready to attend him to the king.</P>
<P>ALMEIDA, from who&s;e mind the image of HAMET had not been ab&s;ent a mo|ment &s;ince &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw him, received this order with a mixture of pain and plea&s;ure; of wi&s;hes, hopes, and appre|hen&s;ions, that &s;illed her bo&s;om with emo|tion,
<PB N="51" REF="021881_0050_0FB753938EDA3730">
and covered her face with blu&s;hes. She had not courage to a&s;k the rea&s;on of the command, which &s;he in&s;tantly prepared to obey; but the tenderne&s;s of Abdallah, who perceived and pitied her di&s;tre&s;s, anticipated her wi&s;h. In a &s;hort time, therefore, he returned to the chamber of pre&s;ence, and having recei|ved permi&s;&s;ion, he entered with ALMEI|DA in his hand. HAMET ro&s;e in ha&s;te to receive her, with a glow of plea&s;ure and impatience in his countenance; and having rai&s;ed her from the ground, &s;up|ported her in his arms, waiting to hear her voice; but though &s;he made many attempts, &s;he could not &s;peak. HAMET, who knew not to what he owed this &s;ud|den and unexpected interview, which, though he wi&s;hed, he could contrive no means to obtain; imagined that ALMEI|DA had &s;ome reque&s;t, and that therefore urged her tenderly to make it: but as &s;he &s;till remained &s;ilent, he looked at Abdallah, as expecting to hear it from him. <Q>We have no wi&s;h, &s;aid Abdal|lah, but to atone for our offence; nor any reque&s;t, but that my lord would now accept the thanks of ALMEIDA
<PB N="52" REF="021881_0051_0FB753950CC16950">
for the life which he has pre&s;erved, and impute the delay, not to ingratitude, but inadvertence: let me now take her back, as thy gift; and let the light of thy favour be upon us.</Q> <Q>Take her, then, &s;aid HAMET; for I would give her only to thee.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words of HAMET did not e&s;|cape the notice either of Abdallah or ALMEIDA; but neither of them men|tioned their conjectures to the other. ALMEIDA, who was inclined to judge of HAMET'S &s;ituation by her own, and who recollected many little incidents, known only to her&s;elf, which favoured her wi&s;hes; indulged the hope, that &s;he &s;hould again hear of HAMET, with more confidence than her father; nor were her expectations di&s;appointed. HAMET reflected with plea&s;ure, that he had pre|pared the way for a more explicit de|claration; and as his impatience encrea|&s;ed with his pa&s;&s;ion every hour, he &s;ent for Abdallah the next morning, and told him, that he wi&s;hed to be more acquaint|ed with his daughter, with a view to make her his wife: <Q>As neither you nor your daughter are my &s;ubjects, &s;ays HA|MET, 
<PB N="53" REF="021881_0052_0FB7539A8C28E658">
I cannot command you; and if you were, upon this occa&s;ion I would not. I do not want a &s;lave, but a friend; not merely a woman, but a wife. If I find ALMEIDA &s;uch as my fancy has feigned her; if her mind corre&s;ponds with her form; and if I have rea&s;on to think, that &s;he can give her heart to HAMET, and not merely her hand to the king, I &s;hall be hap|py.</Q> To this declaration, Abdallah re|plied with expre&s;&s;ions of the profound|e&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and gratitude; and HA|MET di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, to prepare ALMEI|DA to receive him in the afternoon of the &s;ame day.</P>

<P>AS eight moons had only pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the death of Solyman, and as the reverence of HAMET for the memory of his father would not &s;uffer him to marry till the year &s;hould be comple|ted; he determined not to mention AL|MEIDA to his brother, till the time when he could marry her was near. The fierce
<PB N="54" REF="021881_0053_0FB7539ECFFB00E0">
and haughty deportment of ALMORAN, had now left HAMET no room to doubt of his character: and though he had no apprehen&s;ion that he would make any at|tempts upon ALMEIDA, after &s;he &s;hould be his wife; yet he did not know how much might ju&s;tly be feared from his pa&s;&s;ion, if he &s;hould &s;ee her and become enamoured of her, while &s;he was yet a virgin in the hou&s;e of her father.</P>
<P>ALMEIDA had not only un&s;ullied pu|rity of mind, but principles of refined and exalted virtue; and as the life of HAMET was an example of all that was either great or good, Abdallah felt no anxiety upon leaving them together, ex|cept what aro&s;e from his fears, that his daughter would not be able to &s;ecure the conque&s;t &s;he had made.</P>
<P>As it was impo&s;&s;ible for HAMET to have &s;uch an acquaintance with ALMEI|DA as he de&s;ired, till he could enter in|to conver&s;ation with her upon terms of equality; it was his fir&s;t care to &s;ooth her into confidence and familiarity, and by degrees he &s;ucceeded: he &s;oon found, in the free intercour&s;e of mind with
<PB N="55" REF="021881_0054_0FB753A04DB43D60">
mind, which he e&s;tabli&s;hed in&s;tead of the implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which only ecchoed his own voice, how little of the plea&s;ure that women were formed to give can be enjoyed, when they are con&s;idered mere|ly as &s;laves to a tyrant's will, the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects of tran&s;ient dalliance and ca&s;ual enjoyment. The plea&s;ure which he took in the youthful beauty of ALMEIDA, was now endeared, exalted, and refined, by the tender &s;en&s;ibility of her heart, and by the reflexion of his own felicity from her eyes: when he admired the grace|fulne&s;s of her motion, the elegance of her figure, the &s;ymmetry of her features, and the bloom of her complexion, he con&s;idered them as the decorations only of a mind capable of mixing with his own in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delight, of re|ciprocating all his ideas, and catching new plea&s;ure from his plea&s;ure. De&s;ire was no longer appetite; it was imagina|tion, it was rea&s;on; it was included re|membrance of the pa&s;t, and anticipation of the future; and its object was not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ex, but ALMEIDA.</P>
<P>As HAMET never with-held any plea|&s;ure that it was in his power to impart,
<PB N="56" REF="021881_0055_0FB753A5F3815938">
he &s;oon acquainted Abdallah, that he waited only for a proper time to place ALMEIDA upon the throne; but that he had &s;ome rea&s;ons for keeping a re&s;olu|tion, which he thought him&s;elf obliged to communicate to him, concealed from others.</P>
<P>It happened, however, that &s;ome of the women who attended upon ALME|IDA, met with &s;ome female &s;laves be|longing to the &s;eraglio of ALMORAN, at the public baths, and related to them all the particulars of ALMEIDA'S pre|&s;ervation by HAMET; that he had fir&s;t conveyed her to his own apartments, and had &s;ince been frequently with her in that which he had a&s;&s;igned her in his palace: they were al&s;o lavi&s;h in the prai&s;e of her beauty, and free in their conjectures what might be the i&s;&s;ue of her intercour&s;e with HAMET.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;ituation of HAMET and ALMEIDA became the &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation in the &s;eraglio of ALMORAN, who learnt it him&s;elf in a &s;hort time from one of his women.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="021881_0056_0FB753A8C7555990">
He had hitherto profe&s;&s;ed great affec|tion for HAMET, and HAMET was de|ceived by his profe&s;&s;ions: for notwith|&s;tanding the irregularities of his life, he did not think him capable of concealed malice; or of offering injury to another, except when he was urged by impetuous pa&s;&s;ions to immediate plea&s;ure. As there was, therefore, an appearance of mutu|al affection between them, ALMORAN, though the report of ALMEIDA'S beau|ty had fired his imagination and fixed him in a re&s;olution to &s;ee her, did not think proper to attempt it without a&s;k|ing HAMET'S con&s;ent, and being intro|duced by his order; as he made no doubt of there being a connection be|tween them, which would make him re|&s;ent a contrary conduct.</P>
<P>He took an opportunity, therefore, when they were alone in a &s;ummer pa|vilion that was built on a lake behind the palace, to reproach him, with an air of mirth, for having concealed a beauty near his apartments, though he preten|ded to have no &s;eraglio. HAMET in|&s;tantly di&s;covered his &s;urprize and emo|tion by a blu&s;h, which the next moment
<PB N="58" REF="021881_0057_0FB753AA16D379B0">
left his countenance paler than the light clouds that pa&s;s by night over the moon. ALMORAN took no notice of his con|fu&s;ion; but that he might more effectu|ally conceal his &s;entiments and prevent &s;u&s;picion, he &s;uddenly adverted to ano|ther &s;ubject, while HAMET was he&s;ita|ting what to reply. By this artifice HAMET was deceived; and concluded, that whatever ALMORAN had heard of ALMEIDA, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;lightly over his mind, and was remembered but by chance; he, therefore, quickly reco|vered that ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s, which always di&s;tingui&s;hed his conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>ALMORAN ob&s;erved the &s;ucce&s;s of his artifice, &s;oon after, as if by a &s;udden and ca&s;ual recollection, again mentioned the lady; and told him, he would con|gratulate Abdallah upon having re&s;igned her to his bed. As HAMET could not bear to think of ALMORAN'S mentioning ALMEIDA to her father as his mi&s;tre&s;s, he replied, that he had no &s;uch intimacy with ALMEIDA as he &s;uppo&s;ed; and that he had &s;o high an opinion of her virtue, as to believe, that if he &s;hould propo&s;e it &s;he would not con&s;ent. The
<PB N="59" REF="021881_0058_0FB753AC50501620">
imagination of ALMORAN caught new fire from beauties which he found were yet unenjoyed, and virtue which &s;tamped them with &s;uperior value by rendering them more difficult to acce&s;s; and as HAMET had renounced a connection with her as a mi&s;tre&s;s, he wanted only to know whether he intended her for a wife.</P>
<P>This &s;ecret he was contriving to di&s;|cover, when HAMET, having reflected, that if he concealed this particular, AL|MORAN might think him&s;elf at liberty to make what attempts he &s;hould think fit upon ALMEIDA, without being ac|countable to him, or giving him ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, put an end to his doubts, by telling him, he had &s;uch a de&s;ign; but that it would be &s;ome time before he &s;hould carry it into execution. This declaration increa&s;ed ALMORAN'S im|patience: &s;till, however, he concealed his intere&s;t in the conver&s;ation, which he now &s;uffered to drop.</P>
<P>He parted from his brother, without any farther mention of ALMEIDA; but while he was yet near him, turned hastily
<PB N="60" REF="021881_0059_0FB753ADCB967610">
back, and, as if merely to gratify his curio&s;ity, told him with a &s;mile, that he mu&s;t indulge him with a &s;ight of his Circa&s;&s;ian; and de&s;ired he might ac|company him in his next vi&s;it, or at &s;ome more convenient time: with this reque&s;t, HAMET, as he knew not how to refu&s;e it, complied; but it filled his mind with anxiety and trouble.</P>
<P>He went immediately to ALMEIDA, and told her all that had happened; and as &s;he &s;aw that he was not without ap|prehen&s;ions of mi&s;chief from his bro|ther's vi&s;it, &s;he gently reproached him for doubting the fidelity of her affection, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed no power could be ex|erted by ALMORAN to injure him, who in power was equal. HAMET, in a tran&s;port of tenderne&s;s, a&s;&s;ured her that he doubted neither her con&s;tancy nor her love; but as to interrupt the com|fort of her mind, would only double his own di&s;tre&s;s, he did not tell her whence his apprehen&s;ions proceeded; nor indeed had they any determinate object, but aro&s;e in general from the character of his brother and the proba|bility of his becoming a competitor, for
<PB N="61" REF="021881_0060_0FB753B6AF429A30">
what was e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of his life.</P>
<P>But if the happine&s;s of HAMET was le&s;&s;ened, the infelicity of ALMORAN was increa&s;ed. All the enjoyments that were in his power he neglected, his at|tention being wholly fixed upon that which was beyond his reach; he was impatient to &s;ee the beauty, who had taken entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind; and the probability that he would be obli|ged to re&s;ign her to HAMET, tormented him with jealou&s;y, envy, and indigna|tion.</P>
<P>HAMET, however, did not long delay to fulfil his promi&s;e to his brother; but having prepared ALMEIDA to receive him, he conducted him to her apart|ment. The idea which ALMORAN had formed in his imagination, was exceed|ed by the reality, and his pa&s;&s;ion was proportionably increa&s;ed; yet he found means not only to conceal it from HA|MET, but from ALMEIDA, by affecting an air of levity and merriment, which is not le&s;s incompatible with the plea|&s;ures than the pains of love. After they
<PB N="62" REF="021881_0061_0FB753B793887530">
had been regaled with coffee and &s;her|bet, they parted; and HAMET congra|tulated him&s;elf that his apprehen&s;ions of finding in ALMORAN a rival for ALMEI|DA'S love, were now at an end.</P>
<P>But ALMORAN, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were become more violent by re&s;traint, was in a &s;tate of mind little better than di&s;|traction: one moment he determined to &s;eize upon the per&s;on of ALMEIDA in the night, and &s;ecrete her in &s;ome place acce&s;&s;ible only to him&s;elf; and the next to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his brother, that he might at once de&s;troy a rival both in empire and in love. But the&s;e de&s;igns were no &s;ooner formed by his wi&s;hes, than they were rejected by his fears: he was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ignorant, that in any conte&s;t between him and HAMET, the voice of the pub|lic would be again&s;t him; e&s;pecially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a conte&s;t, in which it would appear, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> HAMET had &s;uffered wrong.</P>
<P>Many other projects, equally ra&s;h violent, and injurious, were by turn conceived and rejected; and he came a la&s;t to no other determination, than &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> carefully to conceal his pa&s;&s;ion, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time OMAR, to whom HAMET had from time to time di&s;|clo&s;ed the minute&s;t particulars of his &s;i|tuation and de&s;ign, kept his eye almo&s;t continually upon ALMORAN; and ob|&s;erved him with an attention and &s;aga|city, which it was difficult either to e|lude or deceive. He perceived, that he was more than u&s;ual re&s;tle&s;s and tur|bulent; that in the pre&s;ence of HAMET he frequently changed countenance; that his behaviour was artificial and in|con&s;i&s;tent, frequently &s;hifting from gloo|my di&s;content and furious agitation, to forced laughter and noi&s;y merriment. He had al&s;o remarked, that he &s;eemed mo&s;t di&s;compo&s;ed after he had been with HAMET to ALMEIDA, which hap|pened

generally once in a week; that he was become fond of &s;olitude, and was ab&s;ent &s;everal days together from the apartment of his women.</P>
<P>OMAR, who from this conduct of AL|MORAN had begun to &s;u&s;pect his princi|ples, determined to introduce &s;uch to|pics of di&s;cour&s;e, as might lead him to di&s;cover the &s;tate of his mind; and ena|ble him to enforce and confirm the prin|ciples he had taught him, by new proofs and illu&s;trations.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, who, &s;ince the death of his father, had nothing to apprehend from the di&s;covery of &s;entiments which before he had been careful to conceal; now ur|ged his objections again&s;t religion, when OMAR gave him opportunity, without re&s;erve. <Q>You tell me, &s;ays he, of be|ings that are immortal, becau&s;e they are immaterial; beings which do not con|&s;i&s;t of parts, and which, therefore, can admit no &s;olution, the only natural cau&s;e of corruption and decay: but that which is not material, can have no exten&s;ion; and what has no exten&s;ion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no &s;pace; and of &s;uch beings,

the mind it&s;elf, which you pretend to be &s;uch a being, has no conception.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If the mind, &s;ays OMAR, can per|ceive that there is in it&s;elf any &s;ingle property of &s;uch a being, it has irrefra|gable evidence that it is &s;uch a being; though its mode of exi&s;tence, as di&s;|tinct from matter, cannot now be com|prehended.</Q> <Q>And what property of &s;uch a being, &s;aid ALMORAN, does the mind of man perceive in it&s;elf?</Q> <Q>That of <HI>acting,</HI> &s;aid OMAR, without <HI>motion.</HI> You have no idea, that a material &s;ub|&s;tance can act, but in proportion as it moves: yet to <HI>think,</HI> is to <HI>act;</HI> and with the idea of thinking, the idea of mo|tion is never connected: on the con|trary, we always conceive the mind to be fixed, in proportion to the degree of ardour and inten&s;ene&s;s with which the power of thinking is exerted. Now, if that which is material cannot act with|out motion; and if man is con&s;cious, that to think, is to act and not to move; it follows, that there is, in man, &s;ome|what that is not matter; &s;omewhat that has no exten&s;ion, and that po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es no &s;pace; &s;omewhat which, ha|ving

<P>OMAR pau&s;ed; and ALMORAN ha|ving &s;tood &s;ome moments without reply, he &s;eized this opportunity to impre&s;s him with an awful &s;en&s;e of the power and pre|&s;ence of the Supreme and eternal Being, from whom his own exi&s;tence was deri|ved: <Q>Let us remember, &s;aid he, that to every act of this immaterial and im|mortal part, the Father of &s;pirits, from whom it proceeds, is pre&s;ent: when I behold the bu&s;y multitudes that crowd the metropolis of Per&s;ia, in the pur&s;uit of bu&s;ine&s;s and projects infinitely com|plicated and various; and con&s;ider that every idea which pa&s;&s;es over their minds, every conclu&s;ion and every pur|po&s;e, with all that they remember of the pa&s;t, and all that they imagine of the future, is at once known to the Al|mighty, who without labour or confu|&s;ion weighs every thought of every mind in His ballance, and re&s;erves it to the day of retribution; my follies cover me with confu&s;ion, and my &s;oul is humbled in the du&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="021881_0066_0FB753C68EEE28A8">
ALMORAN, though he appeared to li&s;ten with attention, and offered nothing again&s;t the rea&s;oning of OMAR, yet &s;e|cretly de&s;pi&s;ed it as &s;ophi&s;try, which cun|ning only had rendered &s;pecious; and which he was unable to confute, merely becau&s;e it was &s;ubtil, and not becau&s;e it was true: he had been led by his pa&s;&s;ions, fir&s;t to love, and then to adopt dif|ferent opinions; and as every man is in|clined to judge of others by him&s;elf, he doubted, whether the principles which OMAR had thus laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h, were believed even by OMAR him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus was the mind of ALMORAN to the in&s;tructions of OMAR, as a rock &s;lightly covered with earth, is to the waters of heaven: the craggs are left bare by the rain that wa&s;hes them; and the &s;ame &s;howers that fertilize the field, can only di&s;cover the &s;terility of the rock.</P>
<P>OMAR, however, did not yet di&s;clo&s;e his &s;u&s;picions to HAMET, becau&s;e he did not yet &s;ee that it could an&s;wer any pur|po&s;e. To remove ALMEIDA from her apartment, would be to &s;hew a di&s;tru&s;t, for which there would not appear to be

any cau&s;e; and to refu&s;e ALMORAN ac|ce&s;s to her when he de&s;ired it, might pre|cipitate &s;uch mea&s;ures as he might medi|tate, and engage him in &s;ome de&s;perate attempt: he, therefore, contented him|&s;elf with advi&s;ing HAMET, to conceal the time of his marriage till the evening before he intended it &s;hould take place, without a&s;&s;igning the rea&s;on on which his advice was founded.</P>
<P>To the council of OMAR, HAMET was implicitly obedient, as to the reve|lations of the Prophet; but, like his in|&s;tructions, it was neglected by ALMO|RAN, who became every moment more wretched. He had a graceful per&s;on, and vigorous mind; he was in the bloom of youth, and had a con&s;titution that promi&s;ed him length of days; he had power which princes were emulous to obey, and wealth by which whatever could admini&s;ter to luxury might be bought; for every pa&s;&s;ion, and every appetite, it was ea&s;y for him to procure a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new objects: yet was ALMORAN, not only without enjoyment, but without peace; he was by turns pining with di&s;content, and
<PB N="69" REF="021881_0068_0FB753CFA636BAE8">
raving with indignation; his vices had extracted bitter from every &s;weet; and having exhau&s;ted nature for delight in vain, he was repining at the bounds in which he was confined, and regretting the want of other powers as the cau&s;e of his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Thus the year of mourning for Soly|man was compleated, without any act of violence on the part of ALMORAN, or of caution on the part of HAMET: but on the evening of the la&s;t day, HA|MET, having &s;ecretly prepared every thing for performing the &s;olemnity in a private manner, acquainted ALMORAN by a letter, which OMAR undertook to deliver, that he &s;hould celebrate his marriage on the morrow. ALMORAN, who never doubted but he &s;hould have notice of this event much longer before it was to happen, read the letter with a perturbation that it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal: he was alone in his private apartment, and taking his eye ha&s;tily from the paper, he cru&s;hed it together in his hand, and thru&s;ting it into his bo|&s;om, turned from OMAR without &s;peak|ing; and OMAR thinking him&s;elf di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="021881_0069_0FB753D10C3726C8">
The pa&s;&s;ions which ALMORAN could no longer &s;uppre&s;s, now bur&s;t out in a torrent of exclamation: <Q>Am I then, &s;aid he, bla&s;ted for ever with a double cur&s;e, divided empire and di&s;appointed love! What is dominion, if it is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed alone? and what is power, which the dread of rival power per|petually controuls?

Yet this have I done, becau&s;e this has been done by HAMET: and my heart &s;ic|kens in vain with the de&s;ire of beauty, becau&s;e my power extends not to AL|MEIDA.

His importunity at length prevailed; and he attempted to exculpate him&s;elf, from the charge of having in&s;idiou&s;ly intru|ded upon the privacy of his prince; but ALMORAN &s;ternly interrupted him:&mdash;<Q>And what art thou, &s;aid he, that I &s;hould care, whether thou art innocent or guilty?</Q> <Q>If not for my &s;ake, &s;aid OMAR, li&s;ten for thy own; and though my duty is de&s;pi&s;ed, let my affection be heard.

<P>OMAR obeyed without reply; and AL|MORAN being again alone, the conflict in his mind was renewed with greater violence than before. He felt all that he had di&s;gui&s;ed to OMAR, with the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ibility; and anticipated the effects of his detection, with unutterable angui&s;h and regret. He walked back|ward and forward with a ha&s;ty but inter|rupted pace; &s;ometimes &s;topping &s;hort, and pre&s;&s;ing his hand hard upon his brow; and &s;ometimes by violent je&s;|tures &s;howing the agitation of his mind: he &s;ometimes &s;tood &s;ilent with his eyes fixed upon the ground, and his arms folded together: and &s;ometimes a &s;ud|den agony of thought forced him into loud and tumultuous exclamations: he cur&s;ed the impotence of mind that had &s;uffered his thoughts to e&s;cape from him unawares, without reflecting that he was even then repeating the folly; and while he felt him&s;elf the victim of vice, he could not &s;uppre&s;s his contempt of vir|tue: <Q>If I mu&s;t peri&s;h, &s;aid he, I will at

<P>As he uttered this expre&s;&s;ion, he felt the palace &s;hake: he heard a ru&s;hing, like a bla&s;t in the de&s;art; and a being of more than human appearance &s;tood be|fore him.

<P>ALMORAN, when he recovered from his a&s;toni&s;hment, and had reflected upon the prodigy, determined to wait the i&s;&s;ue, and refer all his hopes to the interpo&s;ition of the Genius, with|out attempting any thing to retard the marriage; at which he re&s;olved to be pre&s;ent, that he might improve any &s;u|pernatural event which might be pro|duced in his favour.</P>
<P>HAMET, in the mean time, was anti|cipating the morrow with a mixture of anxiety and plea&s;ure; and though he had no rea&s;on to think any thing could pre|vent his marriage, yet he wi&s;hed it was over, with an impatience that was con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed by fear.</P>
<P>Though the anticipation of the great event that was now &s;o near, kept him waking the greate&s;t part of the night, yet he ro&s;e early in the morning; and while he waited till ALMEIDA &s;hould be ready to &s;ee him, he was told that OMAR was without, and de&s;ired admit|tance.

When he came in, HAMET, who always watched his countenance as a mariner the &s;tars of heaven, perceived that it was ob&s;cured with perplexity and grief. <Q>Tell me, &s;aid HAMET, whence is the &s;orrow that I di&s;cover in thy face?</Q> <Q>I am &s;orrowful, &s;aid OMAR, not for my&s;elf, but for thee.</Q> At the&s;e words HAMET &s;tept backward, and fixed his eyes upon OMAR, without power to &s;peak. <Q>Con&s;ider, &s;aid OMAR, that thou art not a man only, but a prince: con&s;ider al&s;o, that immortality is be|fore thee; and that thy felicity is be|fore thee; and that thy felicity, during the endle&s;s ages of immortality, de|pends upon thy&s;elf: fear not, there|fore, what thou can&s;t &s;uffer from o|thers; the evil and the good of life are tran&s;ient as the morning dew, and over the&s;e only the hand of others can prevail.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who&s;e attachment to life was &s;trong, and who&s;e expectations of im|mediate enjoyment were high, did not feel the force of what OMAR had &s;aid, though he a&s;&s;ented to its truth. <Q>Tell me, &s;aid he, at once, what thou fear|e&s;t

<P>ARUMOUR of what had happened within had reached them, which &s;ome believed, and &s;ome doubted: but when they &s;aw OMAR and HAMET re|turn together, and ob&s;erved that their looks were full of re&s;entment and trou|ble, they became &s;ilent with attention in a moment; which OMAR ob&s;erving, ad|dre&s;&s;ed them with an eloquence of which they had often acknowledged the force, and of which they never repented the effect.</P>
<P>He told them the tender connection between HAMET and ALMEIDA, and di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ubtil hypocricy of AL|MORAN: he expatiated upon the folly of &s;uppo&s;ing, that the power that was &s;upreme in goodne&s;s and truth, &s;hould

command a violation of vows that had been mutually interchanged, and often repeated; and devote to ALMORAN the beauties, which could only be vo|luntarily &s;urrendered to HAMET. They heard him with a vacant countenance of &s;urprize and wonder: and while he waited for their reply, they agreed a|mong them&s;elves, that no man could avoid the de&s;tiny that was written upon his head; and that if ALMEIDA had thus been taken from HAMET, and given to ALMORAN, it was an event that by an unchangeable decree was appointed to happen; and that, therefore, it was their duty to acquie&s;ce. OMAR then beckon|ed with his hand for audience a &s;econd time; and told them, that ALMORAN had not only practi&s;ed the arts of &s;orce|ry to deprive HAMET of ALMEIDA, but that he meditated a de&s;ign to u&s;urp the &s;ole dominion, and deprive him of the &s;hare of the government to which he had a right by the will of Solyman his father.

<P>OMAR waited till they were again &s;ilent, and then improved the advantage he had gained. <Q>ALMORAN, &s;aid he, con&s;iders you as the &s;laves of his pow|er; HAMET as the objects of his be|nevolence: your lives and your pro|perties, in the opinion of ALMORAN, are below his notice; but HAMET con&s;iders his own intere&s;t as connected with yours.

A new fire was now kindled in their eyes, and their cheeks glowed with in|dignation at the wrongs that threatened them; they were no longer di&s;po&s;ed to act upon the principles of fatality, as they had perver&s;ely under&s;tood them; and they argued at once like rea&s;onable and free beings, who&s;e actions were in their choice, and who had no doubt but that their actions would produce adequate effects. They recollected that OMAR had, in the reign of Solyman, often re&s;cued them from &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion, as now threatened them; and that the power of HAMET had &s;ince interpo&s;ed in their behalf, when ALMORAN would have &s;tretched his prerogative to their hurt, or have left them a prey to the farmer of a tax. <Q>Shall HAMET, &s;aid they, be deprived of the power, that he employs only to our benefit; and &s;hall it center in ALMORAN, who will abu&s;e it to our ruin?

ALMORAN now ordered them to take the command of the troops, that were appointed to attend his per&s;on as their peculiar duty, with as many others as had not declared for HAMET, and to &s;e|cure all the avenues that led to his &s;e|raglio.</P>
<P>OMAR and HAMET were now on hor&s;eback, and had begun to form the troops that had joined them, and as ma|ny others as were armed, which were before mingled together in a confu&s;ed multitude. An account of this was brought to ALMORAN by O&s;myn; and threw him into a perturbation and per|plexity, that di&s;graced his character, and confounded his attendants. He urged O&s;myn, in whom he mo&s;t confided, to di&s;patch, without giving him any orders to execute; then turning from him, he uttered, in a low and inarticulate voice, the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations of di&s;|tre&s;s and terror, being &s;truck with the
<PB N="94" REF="021881_0093_0FB7542AC099A7F0">
thought that his guard might betray him: when he recollected him&s;elf, and perceived that O&s;myn was &s;till pre&s;ent, he bur&s;t into a rage, and &s;natched out his poignard, he &s;wore by the &s;oul of the Prophet, that if he did not in&s;tantly attempt &s;omething, he would &s;tab him to the heart. O&s;myn drew back trembling and confu&s;ed; but having yet received no orders, he would have &s;poken, but ALMORAN drove him from his pre&s;ence with menaces and execrations.</P>
<P>The moment that O&s;myn left him, his rage &s;ub&s;ided in his fears, and his fears were mingled with remorce:&mdash;<Q>Which way &s;oever I turn, &s;aid he, I &s;ee my&s;elf &s;urrounded by de&s;truction.

<P>Caled had a &s;ecret enmity again&s;t O&s;|myn, as his rival in the favour of AL|MORAN; but as he had concealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> own preten&s;ions from O&s;myn, O&s;myn had no ill will again&s;t Caled.

The di&s;appointment of his hope, and the vio|lation of his right, were the chief ob|jects of her regret and her fears, in all that had already happened, and in all that was &s;till to come; every in&s;ult that might be offered to her&s;elf, &s;he con&s;i|dered as an injury to him.

that her imagination could conceive, was po&s;&s;ible; her thoughts were, there|fore, bewildered amid&s;t an endle&s;s va|riety of dreadful images, which &s;tarted up before them which way &s;oever they were turned; and it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he could gain any certain intelligence of his fate, as the &s;plendid pri&s;on in which &s;he was now confined, was &s;urrounded by mutes and eunuchs, of whom nothing could be learned, or in who&s;e report no confidence could be placed.</P>
<P>While her mind was in this &s;tate of agitation and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he perceived the door open, and the next moment AL|MORAN entered the apartment. When &s;he &s;aw him, &s;he turned from him with a look of unutterable angui&s;h; and hiding her face in her veil, &s;he bur&s;t into tears.

This in&s;tantly rou&s;ed her attention, and re&s;entment now &s;u&s;pended her grief: &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urned from him with a &s;irm and haugh|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;tep, and in&s;tead of an&s;wering his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rofe&s;&s;ions, reproached him with her wrongs.

<P>ALMORAN, whom the ardour and impetuo&s;ity of her pa&s;&s;ions kept &s;ome|times &s;ilent, and &s;ometimes threw into confu&s;ion, again attempted to &s;ooth and comfort her: &s;he often urged him to tell her what was become of his bro|ther, and he as often evaded the que&s;ti|on.

&s;u&s;pended for a while every pa&s;&s;ion, but her love: the &s;udden ea&s;e of her mind made her regardle&s;s of all about her, and &s;he had in this interval &s;uf|fered ALMORAN to remove her veil, without reflecting upon what he was doing.

<P>ALMORAN, who&s;e hopes were now bla&s;ted to the root, who perceived that the virtue of ALMEIDA could neither be deceived nor overborne; that &s;he at once contemned his power, and ab|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orred his love; gave way to all the &s;uries of his mind, which now &s;lumbered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o more: his countenance expre&s;&s;ed at once anger, indignation, and de&s;pair; his ge&s;ture became furious, and his voice was lo&s;t in menaces and execrations. ALMEIDA beheld him with an earne&s;t yet &s;teady countenance, till he vowed to revenge the indignity he had &s;uffered, upon HAMET. At the name of HA|MET, her fortitude for&s;ook her; the pride of virtue gave way to the &s;oft|ne&s;s of love; her cheeks became pale, her lips trembled, and taking hold of the robe of ALMORAN, &s;he threw her|&s;elf at his feet.

<P>His fir&s;t thought was to put O&s;myn to death: but he con&s;idered, that by this he would gain no advantage, as he would be in equal danger from whoever &s;hould &s;ucceed him: he con&s;idered al&s;o, that again&s;t O&s;myn he was upon his guard; and that he might at any time learn, from him, whatever de&s;ign might be formed in favour of HAMET, by a&s;|&s;uming HAMET'S appearance: that he would thus be the confident of every &s;ecret, in which his own &s;afety was con|cerned; and might di&s;concert the be&s;t contrived project at the very moment of its execution, when it would be too late for other mea&s;ures to be taken: he deter|mined, therefore, to let O&s;myn live; at lea&s;t, till it became more nece&s;&s;ary to cut him off.

of HAMET, for that would be impo&s;&s;ible, as the ceremony mu&s;t have been per|formed by the prie&s;ts who &s;uppo&s;ed the marriage with HAMET to have been forbidden by a divine command; and who, therefore, would not have confen|ted, even &s;uppo&s;ing they would other|wi&s;e have ventured, at the reque&s;t of HAMET, to perform a ceremony which they knew would be di&s;plea&s;ing to AL|MORAN: but he hoped to take advan|tage of her tenderne&s;s for his brother, and the particular circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation, which made the &s;olemnities of marriage impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;educe her to gratify his de&s;ires, without the &s;anction which alone rendered the gratification of them lawful: if he &s;ucceeded in this de&s;ign, he had rea&s;on to expect, either that his love would be extingui&s;hed by enjoyment; or that, if he &s;hould &s;till de|&s;ire to marry ALMEIDA, he might, by di&s;clo&s;ing to her the artifice by which he had effected his purpo&s;e, prevail up|on her to con&s;ent, as her connection with HAMET, the chief ob&s;tacle to her marriage with him, would then be bro|ken for ever; and as &s;he might, perhaps,

<P>ALMEIDA, as &s;oon as &s;he was left alone, began to review the &s;cene that had ju&s;t pa&s;t; and was every mo|ment affected with new wonder, grief, and re&s;entment. She now deplored her

own misfortune; and now conceived a de&s;ign to puni&s;h the author of it, from who&s;e face &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed the hand of ad|ver&s;ity had torn the ma&s;k under which he had deceived her: it appeared to her very ea&s;y, to take a &s;evere revenge upon HAMET for the indignity which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he had offered her, by complaining of it to ALMORAN; and telling him, that he had gained admit|tance to her by bribing the eunuch who kept the door. The thought of thus giving him up, was one moment rejec|ted, as ari&s;ing from a vindictive &s;pirit; and the next indulged, as an act of ju&s;|tice to ALMORAN, and a puni&s;hment due to the hypocricy of HAMET: to the fir&s;t &s;he inclined, when her grief, which was &s;till mingled with a tender remembrance of the man &s;he loved, was predominant; and to the la&s;t, when her grief gave way to indignation.</P>
<P>Thus are we inclined to con&s;ider the &s;ame action, either as a virtue, or a vice, by the influence of different pa&s;&s;ions, which prompt us either to perform or to avoid it. ALMEIDA, from deliberating whether &s;he &s;hould accu&s;e HAMET to

ALMORAN, or conceal his fault, was led to con&s;ider what puni&s;hment he would either incur or e&s;cape in con&s;equence of her determination; and the images that ru&s;hed into her mind, the moment this became the object of her thoughts, at once determined her to be &s;ilent: <Q>Could I bear to &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, that hand, which has &s;o often trembled with delight when it en&s;olded mine, convul&s;ed and black! tho&s;e eyes, that as often as they gazed upon me were di&s;&s;olved in tears of tenderne&s;s and love, &s;tart from the &s;ockets! and tho&s;e lips that breathed the &s;ofte&s;t &s;ighs of elegant de&s;ire, di&s;torted and ga&s;ping in the convul&s;ions of death!</Q></P>
<P>From this image, her mind recoiled in an agony of terror and piety; her heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">unk within her; her limbs trem|bled; &s;he &s;unk down upon the &s;ofa, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>By this time, HAMET, on who&s;e form the likene&s;s of ALMORAN was &s;till im|pre&s;&s;ed, had reached the palace. He went in&s;tantly towards the apartment of the women. In&s;tead of that cheerful

His fir&s;t view was to di&s;cover, whether ALMORNA had already &s;upplanted him; and for this purpo&s;e he collected the whole &s;trength of his mind: he con&s;idered that he ap|peared

<P>In this &s;ituation, &s;he, who had but a few moments before doubted, whether &s;he &s;hould not voluntarily give him up, when nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;afety than to be &s;ilent; now determi|ned, with whatever reluctance, to &s;ecure him, though it could not be done with|out di&s;&s;imulation, and though it was pro|bable that in this di&s;&s;imulation &s;he would be detected.

thus addre&s;&s;ed by the name of his bro|ther, again recollected his &s;ituation; and now fir&s;t conceived the idea, that the al|teration of ALMEIDA'S &s;entiments with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, might be the effect of &s;ome violence offered her by ALMO|RAN in his likene&s;s; he, therefore, re|curred to his fir&s;t purpo&s;e, and deter|mined, by a direct enquiry, to di&s;cover, whether &s;he had &s;een him under that ap|pearance. This enquiry he urged with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity and ardor, in terms &s;uitable to his pre&s;ent appearance and &s;ituation: <Q>Tell me, &s;aid he, have the&s;e doors been open to HAMET? Has he obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that trea&s;ure, which, by the voice of Heaven, has been allotted to me?</Q></P>
<P>To this double que&s;tion, ALMEIDA an&s;wered by a &s;ingle negative; and her an&s;wer, therefore, was both fal&s;e and true: it was true that her per&s;on was &s;till inviolate, and it was true al&s;o that HA|MET had not been admitted to her; yet her denial of it was fal&s;e, for &s;he belie|ved the contrary; ALMORAN only had been admitted, but &s;he had received him as his brother. HAMET, however, was
<PB N="160" REF="021881_0157_0FB754F1D77C67C8">
&s;atisfied with the an&s;wer, and did not di&s;|cover its fallacy. He looked up to hea|ven, with an expre&s;&s;ion of gratitude and joy; and then turning to ALMEIDA, <Q>Swear then, &s;aid he, that thou ha&s;t granted to HAMET, no pledge of thy love which &s;hould be re&s;erved for me.</Q> ALMEIDA, who now thought nothing more than the a&s;&s;everation nece&s;&s;ary to quiet his mind, immediately complied: <Q>I &s;wear, &s;aid &s;he, that to HAMET I have given nothing, which thou would&s;t wi&s;h me to with-hold: the power that has devoted my per&s;on to thee, has di&s;|united my heart from HAMET, whom I renounce in thy pre&s;ence for ever.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who&s;e &s;ortitude and recollec|tion were again overborne, was thrown into an agitation of mind, which di&s;co|vered it&s;elf by looks and ge&s;tures very different from tho&s;e which ALMEIDA had expected, and overwhelmed her with new confu&s;ion and di&s;appointment: that he, who had &s;o lately &s;olicited her love with all the vehemence of a de&s;ire im|patient to be gratified, &s;hould now re|ceive a declaration that &s;he was ready to comply, with marks of di&s;tre&s;s and

anger, was a my&s;tery which &s;he could not &s;olve. In the mean time, the &s;trug|gle in his brea&s;t became every moment more violent: <Q>Where, then, &s;aid he, is the con&s;tancy which you vowed to HAMET; and for what in&s;tance of his love is he now for&s;aken?</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA was now more embarra&s;&s;ed than before; &s;he felt all the force of the reproof, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been given by ALMORAN; and &s;he could be ju&s;|tified only by relating the particular, which at the expence of her &s;incerity &s;he had determined to conceal. ALMORAN was now exalted in her opinion, while his form was animated by the &s;pirit of HAMET; as much as HAMET had been degraded, while his form was animated by the &s;pirit of ALMORAN. In his re|&s;entment of her perfidy to his rival, tho' it favoured his fonde&s;t and mo&s;t ar|dent wi&s;hes, there was an abhorrence of vice, and a genero&s;ity of mind, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been in|compatible with his character. To his reproach, &s;he could reply only by com|plaint; and could no otherwi&s;e evade his que&s;tion, than by ob&s;erving the in|con&s;i&s;tency

of his own behaviour: <Q>Your words, &s;aid &s;he, are daggers to my heart.

<P>HAMET, who was now fired with re|&s;entment again&s;t ALMEIDA, whom yet he could not behold without de&s;ire; and who, at the &s;ame moment, was impatient to revenge his wrongs upon ALMORAN; was &s;uddenly prompted to &s;atisfy all his pa&s;&s;ions, by taking advantage of the wiles of ALMORAN and the perfidy of ALMEIDA, to defeat the one and to puni&s;h the other. It was now in his power in&s;tantly to con&s;ummate his mar|riage, as a prie&s;t might be procured without a moment's delay, and as AL|MEIDA'S con&s;ent was already given; he would then obtain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her per&s;on, by the very act in which &s;he perfidiou&s;ly re&s;igned it to his rival; to
<PB N="163" REF="021881_0160_0FB754FD43D21E70">
whom he would then leave the beauties he had already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and ca&s;t from him in di&s;dain, as united with a mind that he could never love. As his ima|gination was fired with the fir&s;t concep|tion of this de&s;ign, he caught her to his brea&s;t with a fury, in which all the pa&s;|&s;ions in all their rage were at once con|centred: <Q>Let the prie&s;t, &s;aid he, in|&s;tantly unite us. Let us comprize, in one moment, in this in&s;tant, NOW, our whole of being, and exclude alike the future and the pa&s;t!</Q> Then gra&s;ping her &s;till in his arms, he looked up to heaven: <Q>Ye powers, &s;aid he, invi&s;i|ble but yet pre&s;ent, who mould my changing and unre&s;i&s;ting form; pro|long, but for one hour, that my&s;terious charm, that is now upon me, and I will be ever after &s;ub&s;ervient to your will!</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA, who was terrified at the furious ardor of this unintelligible ad|dre&s;s, &s;hrunk from his embrace, pale and trembling without power to reply. HA|MET gazed tenderly upon her; and re|collecting the purity and tenderne&s;s with which he had loved her, his virtues &s;ud|denly
<PB N="164" REF="021881_0161_0FB754FE8D375CA0">
recovered their force; he di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed her from his embrace; and turning from her, he dropped in &s;ilence the tear that &s;tarted to his eye, and expre&s;&s;ed, in a low and faultering voice, thoughts that ru&s;hed upon his mind: <Q>No, &s;aid he; HAMET &s;hall &s;till di&s;dain the joy, which is at once &s;ordid and tran&s;ient: in the brea&s;t of HAMET, lu&s;t &s;hall not be the pander of revenge.

Let this be the portion of tho&s;e, that hate me without a cau&s;e; but let this be far from me!</Q> At this thought, he felt a &s;udden elation of mind; and the con&s;cious dignity of vir|tue, that in &s;uch a conflict was victori|ous, rendered him, in this glorious mo|ment, &s;uperior to misfortune: his ge&s;|ture became calm, and his countenance &s;edate; he con&s;idered the wrongs he
<PB N="165" REF="021881_0162_0FB755000ACCD0F8">
&s;uffered, not as a &s;ufferer, but as a judge; and he determined at once to di&s;cover him&s;elf to ALMEIDA, and to reproach her with her crime. He remarked her confu&s;ion without pity, as the effect not of grief but of guilt; and fixing his eyes upon her, with the calm &s;everity of a &s;uperior and offended being, <Q>Such, &s;aid he, is the benevolence of the Al|mighty to the children of the du&s;t, that our misfortunes are, like poi&s;ons, an|tidotes to each other.</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA, who&s;e faculties were now &s;u&s;pended by wonder and expectation, looked earne&s;tly at him, but conti|nued &s;ilent. <Q>Thy looks, &s;aid HA|MET, are full of wonder; but as yet thy wonder has no cau&s;e, in compari|&s;on of that which &s;hall be revealed. Thou knowe&s;t the prodigy, which &s;o lately parted HAMET and ALMEIDA: I am that HAMET, thou art that AL|MEIDA.</Q> ALMEIDA would now have &punc;interrupted him; but HAMET rai&s;ed his voice&punc; and demanded to be heard: <Q>At that moment, &s;aid he, wretched as I am, the child of error and di&s;obe|dience, my heart repined in &s;ecret at

the de&s;tiny which had been written upon my head; for I then thought thee faithful and con&s;tant: but if our hand had been then united, I &s;hould have been more wretched than I am; for I now know that thou art fickle and fal&s;e. To know thee, though it has pierced my &s;oul with &s;orrow, has yet healed the wound which was inflicted when I lo&s;t thee: and though I am now com|pelled to wear the form of ALMORAN, who&s;e vices are this moment di&s;gracing mine, yet in the balance I &s;hall be weighed as HAMET, and I &s;hall &s;uffer only as I am found wanting.</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA, who&s;e mind was now in a tumult that bordered upon di&s;traction, bewildered in a labyrinth of doubt and wonder, and alike dreading the con&s;e|quence of what &s;he heard, whether it was fal&s;e or true, was yet impatient to confute or confirm it; and as &s;oon as &s;he had recovered her &s;peech, urged him for &s;ome token of the prodigy he a&s;&s;erted, which he might ea&s;ily have giv|en by relating any of the incidents which them&s;elves only could know.

la&s;t di&s;engaged him&s;elf from O&s;myn, by whom he had been long detained, re|&s;umed his own figure: and while the eyes of ALMEIDA were fixed upon HA|MET, his powers were &s;uddenly taken from him, and re&s;tored in an in&s;tant; and &s;he beheld the features of ALMO|RAN vani&s;h, and gazed with a&s;toni&s;h|ment upon his own: <Q>Thy features change! &s;aid &s;he, and thou indeed art HAMET.</Q> <Q>The &s;udden trance, &s;aid he, has re&s;tored me to my&s;elf; and from my wrongs where &s;halt thou be hidden?</Q> This reproach was more than &s;he could &s;u&s;tain; but he caught her as &s;he was falling, and &s;upported her in his arms. This incident renewed in a moment all the tenderne&s;s of his love: while he beheld her di&s;tre&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ed her by the embrace that &s;u&s;tained her to his bo&s;om, he forgot every injury which he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had done him; and perceived her recovery with a plea|&s;ure, that for a moment &s;u&s;pended the &s;en&s;e of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t reflection was upon the &s;nare, in which &s;he had been taken; and her fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation was joy that &s;he had e&s;|caped:

I thought the vices which, under thy form, I di&s;covered in his bo&s;om, were thine; and in the angui&s;h of grief, in|dignation, and di&s;appointment, my heart renounced thee: yet as I could not give thee up to death, I could not di&s;cover to ALMORAN the attempt

which I imputed to thee; when you que&s;tioned me, therefore, as ALMO|RAN, I was betrayed to di&s;&s;imulation, by the tenderne&s;s which &s;till melted my heart for HAMET.</Q> 'I believe thee,' &s;aid HAMET, catching her in a tran&s;port to his brea&s;t: <Q>I love thee for thy virtue; and may the pure and exalted beings, who are &s;uperior to the pa&s;&s;ions that now throb in my heart, forgive me, if I love thee al&s;o for thy fault.

<P>BUT while ALMEIDA and HAMET were thus congratulating each other upon the evils which they had e&s;caped, they were threatened by others, which, however obvious, they had overlooked.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, who was now exulting in the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s that had exceed|ed his hopes, and who &s;uppo&s;ed the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of ALMEIDA before the end of the next hour, was as certain as that the next hour would arrive, &s;uddenly enter|ed the apartment; but upon di&s;cover|ing HAMET, he &s;tarted back a&s;toni&s;hed and di&s;appointed.

<P>ALMEIDA, who perceived the &s;torm to be gathering, which the next moment would bur&s;t upon the head of HAMET, interpo&s;ed between them, and addre&s;&s;ed each of them by turns; urging HAMET to be &s;ilent, and conjuring ALMORAN to be merciful. ALMORAN however, without regarding ALMEIDA, or making
<PB N="172" REF="021881_0169_0FB75515D07F09A8">
any reply to HAMET, &s;truck the ground with his foot, and the me&s;&s;engers of death, to whom the &s;ignal was familiar, appeared at the door. ALMORAN then commanded them to &s;eize his brother, with a countenance pale and livid, and a voice that was broken by rage. HA|MET was &s;till unmoved; but ALMEIDA threw her&s;elf at the feet of ALMORAN, and embracing his knees was about to &s;peak, but he broke from her with &s;ud|den fury: <Q>If the world &s;hould &s;ue, &s;aid he, I would &s;purn it off. There is no pang that cunning can invent, which he &s;hall not &s;uffer: and when death at length &s;hall di&s;appoint my ven|geance, his mangled limbs &s;hall be ca&s;t out unburied, to feed the bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert and the fowls of heaven.</Q> Du|ring this menace, ALMEIDA &s;unk down without &s;igns of life; and HAMET &s;trug|gling in vain for liberty to rai&s;e her from the ground, &s;he was carried off by &s;ome women who were called to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In this awful cri&s;is, HAMET, who felt his own fortitude give way, looked up; and though he conceived no words, a prayer a&s;cended from his heart to hea|ven,
<PB N="173" REF="021881_0170_0FB755174F34D668">
and was accepted by Him, to whom our thoughts are known while they are yet afar off. For HAMET, the fountain of &s;trength was opened from above; his eye &s;parkled with confidence, and his brea&s;t was dilated by hope. He com|manded the guard that were leading him away to &s;top, and they implicitly obey|ed; he then &s;tretched out his hand to|wards ALMORAN, who&s;e &s;pirit was re|buked before him: <Q>Hear me, &s;aid he, thou tyrant! for it is thy genius that &s;peaks by my voice. What has been the fruit of all thy guilt, but accumu|lated mi&s;ery? What joy ha&s;t thou de|rived from undivided empire? what joy from the prohibition of my marri|age with ALMEIDA? what good from that power, which &s;ome evil daemon has added to thy own? what, at this moment, is thy portion, but rage and angui&s;h, di&s;appointment and de&s;pair? Even I, whom thou &s;ee&s;t the captive of thy power, whom thou ha&s;t wrong|ed of empire, and yet more of love; even I am happy in compari&s;on of thee. I know that my &s;ufferings, however multiplied, are &s;hort; for they &s;hall

end with life, and no life is long: then &s;hall the everla&s;ting ages commence; and through everla&s;ting ages thy &s;uf|ferings &s;hall increa&s;e.

<P>As the words of HAMET &s;truck AL|MORAN with terror&punc; and over-awed him by an influence which he could not &s;ur|mount; HAMET was forced from his pre&s;ence, before any other orders had been given about him, than were im|plied in the menace that was addre&s;&s;ed

<P>When ALMORAN was &s;ufficiently re|collected to con&s;ider his &s;ituation, he de&s;paired of prevailing upon ALMEIDA to gratify his wi&s;hes, till her attachment to HAMET was irreparably broken; and he, therefore, re&s;olved to put him to death.

<P>THE officer who commanded the guard that kept the gate of the pri&s;on, was Caled. He was now next in tru&s;t and power to O&s;myn: but as he had propo&s;ed a revolt to HAMET, in which O&s;myn had refu&s;ed to concur, he knew that his life was now in his power; he dreaded le&s;t, for &s;ome &s;light offence, or in &s;ome fit of cau&s;ele&s;s di&s;|plea&s;ure, he &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret to ALMORAN, who would then certainly condemn him to death. To &s;ecure this fatal &s;ecret, and put an end to his inqui|etude,
<PB N="180" REF="021881_0177_0FB7552F7ADE4448">
he re&s;olved from the moment that ALMORAN was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the throne, to find &s;ome opportunity &s;ecret|ly to de&s;troy O&s;myn: in this re&s;olution, he was confirmed by the enmity, which inferior minds never fail to conceive again&s;t that merit, which they cannot but envy without &s;pirit to emulate, and by which they feel them&s;elves di&s;graced without an effort to acquire equal ho|nour; it was confirmed al&s;o by the hope which Caled had conceived, that, upon the death of O&s;myn, he &s;hould &s;ucceed to his po&s;t: his apprehen&s;ions likewi&s;e were increa&s;ed, by the gloom which he remarked in the countenance of O&s;myn; and which, not knowing that it aro&s;e from fear, he imputed to jealou&s;y and malevolence.</P>
<P>When ALMORAN, who had now a&s;|&s;umed the appearance of O&s;myn, had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ubterranean avenue to the dungeon in which HAMET was confined, he was met by Caled; of whom he de|manded admittance to the prince; and produced his own &s;ignet, as a te&s;timony that he came with the authority of the king. As it was Caled's intere&s;t to &s;e|cure

the favour of O&s;myn till an oppor|tunity &s;hould offer to cut him off, he received him with every po&s;&s;ible mark of re&s;pect and reverence; and when he was gone into the dungeon, he com|manded a beverage to be prepared for him again&s;t he &s;hould return, in which &s;uch &s;pices were infu&s;ed, as might expel the malignity which, in that place, might be received with the breath of life; and taking him&s;elf the key of the pri&s;on, he waited at the door.</P>
<P>When ALMORAN entered the dun|geon, with a lamp which he had receiv|ed from Caled, he found HAMET &s;itting upon the ground: his countenance was impre&s;&s;ed with the characters of grief; but it retained no marks either of an|ger or fear. When he looked up, and &s;aw the features of O&s;myn, he judged that the mutes were behind him; and, therefore, ro&s;e up, to prepare him&s;elf for death.

him with the death of HAMET. HAMET, in the mean time, having gra&s;ped the dagger in his hand, and rai&s;ed his arm for the blow, <Q>This, &s;aid he, is my pa&s;&s;port to the realms of peace, the im|mediate and only object of my hope!</Q> But at the&s;e words, his mind in&s;tantly took the alarm: <Q>Let me reflect, &s;aid he, a moment: from what can I de|rive hope in death?&mdash;from that patient and pre&s;erving virtue, and from that alone, by which we fulfil the ta&s;k that is a&s;&s;igned us upon the earth.

<P>ALMORAN, who had now re&s;olved to &s;end for the intelligence which he long|ed to hear, was di&s;patching a me&s;&s;enger to the pri&s;on, when he was told that Ca|led

de&s;ired admittance to his pre&s;ence. At the name of Caled, he &s;tarted up in an exta&s;y of joy; and not doubting but that HAMET was dead, he ordered him to be in&s;tantly admitted. When he came in, ALMORAN made no enquiry about HAMET, becau&s;e he would not appear to expect the event, which yet he &s;up|po&s;ed he had brought about; he, there|fore, a&s;ked him only upon what bu&s;ine&s;s he came. <Q>I come, my lord, &s;aid he, to apprize thee of the treachery of O&s;|myn.</Q> <Q>I know, &s;aid ALMORAN, that O&s;myn is a traitor; but of what do&s;t thou accu&s;e him?</Q> <Q>As I was but now, &s;aid he, changing the guard which is &s;et upon HAMET, O&s;myn came up to the door of the pri&s;on, and producing the royal &s;ignet demanded admittance.

What were the means I know not; but he talked of &s;peed, and &s;uppo&s;ed that the effect was cer|tain.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, though he was &s;till impa|tient to hear of HAMET; and di&s;co|vered, that if he was dead, his death was unknown to Caled; was yet notwith|&s;tanding rejoiced at what he heard: and as he knew what Caled told him to be true, as the conver&s;ation he related had pa&s;&s;ed between him&s;elf and HAMET, he exulted in the plea&s;ing confidence that he had yet a friend; the glooms of &s;u&s;|picion, which had involved his mind, were di&s;&s;ipated, and his countenance brightened with complacency and joy.
<PB N="187" REF="021881_0184_0FB755450F188850">
He had delayed to put O&s;myn to death, only becau&s;e he could appoint no man to &s;ucceed him, of whom his fears did not render him equally &s;u&s;picious: but having now found, in Caled, a friend, who&s;e fidelity had been approved when there had been no intention to try it; and being impatient to reward his zeal, and to inve&s;t his fidelity with that pow|er, which would render his &s;ervices mo&s;t important; he took a ring from his own finger, and putting it upon that of Caled, <Q>Take this, &s;aid he, as a pledge, that to-morrow O&s;myn &s;hall lo&s;e his head; and that, from this mo|ment thou art inve&s;ted with his power.</Q></P>
<P>Caled having, in the conver&s;ation between ALMORAN and HAMET, di&s;|cerned indubitable treachery, which he imputed to O&s;myn, who&s;e appearance ALMORAN had then a&s;&s;umed, eagerly &s;eized the opportunity to de&s;troy him; he, therefore, not tru&s;ting to the event of his accu&s;ation, had mingled poi&s;on in the bowl which he pre&s;ented to AL|MORAN when he came out from HA|MET: this, however, at fir&s;t he had re|&s;olved to conceal.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="021881_0185_0FB75546A1B29258">
In con&s;equence of his accu&s;ation, he &s;uppo&s;ed O&s;myn would be que&s;tioned upon the rack; he &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o, that the accu&s;ation, as it was true, would be confirmed by his confe&s;&s;ion; that what|ever he &s;hould then &s;ay to the preju|dice of his accu&s;er, would be di&s;believed; and that when after a few hours the poi&s;on &s;hould take effect, no inqui&s;ition would be made into the death of a cri|minal, whom the bow-&s;tring or the &s;ci|mitar would otherwi&s;e have been em|ployed to de&s;troy. But he now hoped to derive new merit from an act of zeal, which ALMORAN had approved before it was known, by condemning his rival to die, who&s;e death he had already in|&s;ured: <Q>May the wi&s;hes of my lord, &s;aid he, be always anticipated; and may it be found, that whatever he or|dains is already done: may he accept the zeal of his &s;ervant, whom he has delighted to honour; for, before the light of the morning &s;hall return, the eyes of O&s;myn &s;hall clo&s;e in everla&s;ting darkne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words, the countenance of ALMORAN changed; his cheeks became

pale, and his lips trembled: <Q>What then, &s;aid he, ha&s;t thou done?</Q> Ca|led, who was terrified and a&s;toni&s;hed, threw him&s;elf upon the ground, and was unable to reply. ALMORAN, who now, by the utmo&s;t effort of his mind, re|&s;trained his confu&s;ion and his fear, that he might learn the truth from Caled without di&s;&s;imulation or di&s;gui&s;e, rai&s;ed him from the ground and repeated his enquiry. <Q>If I have erred, &s;aid Caled, impute it not: when I had detected the treachery of O&s;myn, I was tran&s;|ported by my zeal for thee. For proof that he is guilty, I appeal now to him|&s;elf; for he yet lives: but that he might not e&s;cape the hand of ju&s;tice, I mingled, in the bowl I gave him, the drugs of death.</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words, ALMORAN, &s;triking his hands together, looked upward in an agony of de&s;pair and horror, and fell back upon a &s;ofa that was behind him. Caled, who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hment was equal to his di&s;appointment and fears, approached him with a trembling tho' ha&s;ty pace; but as he &s;tooped to &s;up|port him, ALMORAN &s;uddenly drew his

<P>In this dreadful moment, the Genius once more appeared before him; at the &s;ight of whom he waved his hand, but was unable to &s;peak. <Q>Nothing, &s;aid the Genius, that has happened to AL|MORAN, is hidden from me.

Invoke the &s;pirits, that re&s;ide we&s;tward from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un; and northward, in the regions of cold and darkne&s;s: then &s;tretch out thy hand, and a lamp of &s;ulphur, &s;elf-kindled, &s;hall burn be|fore thee. In the fire of this lamp, con|&s;ume that which I now give thee; and as the &s;moke, into which it changes, &s;hall mix with the air a mighty charm &s;hall be formed, which &s;hall defend thee from all mi&s;chief: from that in&s;tant, no poi&s;on, however potent, can hurt thee; nor &s;hall any pri&s;on confine: in one moment thou &s;halt be re&s;tored to the throne, and to ALMEIDA; and the An|gel of death &s;hall lay his hand upon thy brother; to whom, if I had confided this la&s;t be&s;t effort of my power, he would have &s;ecured the good to him|&s;elf, and have transferred the evil to thee.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="021881_0193_0FB75560CA70A350">
ALMORAN, who had li&s;tened un&s;een to this addre&s;s of the Genius to HAMET, was now confirmed in his &s;u&s;picions, that evil had been ultimately intended again&s;t him; and that he had been entangled in the toils of perfidy, while he believed him&s;elf to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the efforts of friend&s;hip: he was al&s;o convinced, that by the Genius he was not known to be pre&s;ent. HAMET, however, &s;tood &s;till doubtful, and ALMORAN was kept &s;ilent by his fears. <Q>Whoever thou art, &s;aid HAMET, the condition of the advan|tages which thou ha&s;t offered me is &s;uch as it is not lawful to fulfil: the&s;e horrid rites, and this commerce with unholy powers, are prohibited to mor|tals in the Law of Life.</Q> <Q>See thou to that, &s;aid the Genius: Good and evil are before thee; that which I now of|fer thee, I will offer no more.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who had not fortitude to give up at once the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ecuring the advantages that had been offered, and who was &s;educed by human frailty to deliberate at lea&s;t upon the choice, &s;tretched out his hand, and receiving the &s;croll, the Genius in&s;tantly di&s;ap|peared.
<PB N="197" REF="021881_0194_0FB7556744BC6318">
That which had been propo&s;ed as a trial of his virtue, ALMORAN be|lieved indeed to be an offer of advan|tage; he had no hope, therefore, but that HAMET would refu&s;e the condi|tions, and that he &s;hould be able to ob|tain the tali&s;man, and fulfil them him|&s;elf: he judged that the mind of HAMET was in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and was doubtful to which &s;ide it might finally incline: he, therefore, in&s;tantly a&s;&s;umed the voice and the per&s;on of OMAR, that by the influence of his council he might be able to turn the &s;cale.</P>
<P>When the change was effected, he called HAMET by his name; and HA|MET who knew the voice, an&s;wered him in a tran&s;port of joy and wonder: <Q>My friend, &s;aid he, my father! in this dreary &s;olitude, in this hour of trial, thou art welcome to my &s;oul as liberty and life! Guide me to thee by thy voice; and tell me, while I hold thee to my bo&s;om, how and wherefore art thou come?</Q> <Q>Do not now a&s;k me, &s;aid ALMORAN: it is enough that I am here; and that I am permitted to warn thee of the precipice on which
<PB N="198" REF="021881_0195_0FB75568559BAD60">
thou &s;tande&s;t. It is enough, that con|cealed in this darkne&s;s, I have over|heard the &s;pecious guile, which &s;ome evil daemon has practi&s;ed upon thee.</Q> <Q>Is it then certain, &s;aid HAMET, that this being is evil?</Q> <Q>Is not that being evil, &s;aid ALMORAN, who propo&s;es evil as the condition of good?</Q> <Q>Shall I then, &s;aid HAMET, renounce my liberty and life? The rack is now rea|dy; and, perhaps, the next moment, its tortures will be inevitable.</Q> <Q>Let me a&s;k thee then, &s;aid ALMORAN, to pre&s;erve thy life, wilt thou de&s;troy thy &s;oul?</Q> <Q>O! &s;tay, &s;aid HAMET&mdash;Let me not be tried too far! Let the &s;trength of Him who is Almighty, be manife&s;t in my weakne&s;s!</Q> HAMET then pau&s;ed a few moments; but he was no longer in doubt: and ALMORAN, who di&s;believed and de&s;pi&s;ed the argu|ments, by which he intended to per&s;uade him to renounce what, upon the &s;ame condition, he was impatient to &s;ecure for him&s;elf, conceived hopes that he &s;hould &s;ucceed; and tho&s;e hopes were in&s;tantly confirmed. <Q>Take then, &s;aid HAMET, this unholy charm; and re|move

it far from me, as the &s;ands of Alai from the trees of Oman; le&s;t in &s;ome dreadful hour my virtue may fail me, and thy coun&s;el may be want|ing.</Q> 'Give it me then,' &s;aid AL|MORAN; and feeling for the hands of each other, he &s;natched it from him in an exta&s;y of joy; and in&s;tantly re&s;uming his own voice and figure, he cried out, <Q>At length I have prevailed: and life and love, dominion and revenge, are now at once in my hand!</Q></P>
<P>HAMET heard and knew the voice of his brother, with a&s;toni&s;hment; but it was too late to wi&s;h he had withheld the charm, which his virtue would not permit him to u&s;e. <Q>Yet a few mo|ments pa&s;s, &s;aid ALMORAN, and thou art nothing.</Q> HAMET, who doubted not of the power of the tali&s;man, and knew that ALMORAN had no principles which would re&s;train him from u&s;ing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o his de&s;truction, re&s;igned him&s;elf to dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, with a &s;acred joy that he had e&s;caped from guilt. ALMORAN then, with an e|lation of mind that &s;parkled in his eyes, and glowed upon his che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k, &s;tretched o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t his hand, in which he held the &s;croll;
<PB N="200" REF="021881_0197_0FB7556E92CDA4F8">
and a lamp of burning &s;ulphur was im|mediately &s;u&s;pended in the air before him: he held the my&s;terious writing in the flame; and as it began to burn, the place &s;hook with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">iterated thunder, of which every peal was more terrible and more loud. HAMET, wrapping his robe round him, cried out, <Q>In the Foun|tain of Life that flows for ever, let my life be mingled! Let me not be, as if I had never been; but &s;till con&s;cious of my being, let me &s;till glorify Him from whom it is derived, and be &s;till happy in his love.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, who was ab&s;orbed in the anticipation of his own felicity, heard the thunder without dread, as the pro|clamation of his triumph: <Q>Let thy hopes, &s;aid he, be thy portion; and the plea&s;ures, that I have &s;ecured, &s;hall be mine.</Q> As he pronounced the&s;e words, he &s;tarted as at a &s;udden pang; his eyes became fixed, and his po&s;ture immoveable; yet his &s;en&s;es &s;till remain|ed, and he perceived the Genius once more to &s;tand before him. <Q>ALMORAN, &s;aid he, to the la&s;t &s;ounds which thou &s;halt hear, let thine ear be attentive!
<PB N="201" REF="021881_0198_0FB75571829C1358">
Of the &s;pirits that rejoice to fulfil the purpo&s;e of the Almighty, I am one. To HAMET, and to ALMORAN, I have been commi&s;&s;ioned from above: I have been appointed to perfect virtue by adver&s;ity; and, in the folly of her own projects, to entangle vice. The charm, which could be formed only by guilt, has power only to produce mi&s;ery: of every good which thou, ALMORAN, would&s;t have &s;ecured by di&s;obedience, the oppo&s;ite evil is thy portion: and of every evil which thou, HAMET, wa&s;t, by obedience, willing to incur, the oppo&s;ite good is be&s;towed upon thee. To thee, HAMET, are now given the throne of thy father, and ALMEIDA. And thou, ALMO|RAN, who, while I &s;peak, art incorpo|rating with the earth, &s;halt remain, through all generations, a memorial of the truths which thy life has taught!</Q></P>
<P>At the words of the Genius, the earth trembled beneath, and above the walls of the pri&s;on di&s;appeared: the figure of ALMORAN, which was hardened into &s;tone, expanded by degrees; and a rock, by which his form and attitude are &s;till

rudely expre&s;&s;ed, became at once a mo|nument of his puni&s;hment and his guilt.</P>
<P>Such are the events recorded by AC|MET, the de&s;cendant of the Prophet, and the preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s! for, to ACMET, that which pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ecret was revealed by the Angel of in&s;tructi|on, that the world might know, that, to the wicked, increa&s;e of power is increa&s;e of wretchedne&s;s; and that tho&s;e who condemn the folly of an attempt to de|feat the purpo&s;e of a Genius, might no longer hope to elude the appointment of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
