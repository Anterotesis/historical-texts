<P>"So when all I&s;rael &s;aw that the King heark|ened not unto them, the People an&s;wered the King, &s;aying, what portion have we in David, neither have we inheritance in the Son of Je&s;&s;e: to your tents, O I&s;rael: now &s;ee to thine own hou&s;e, David."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Independence of the North-American Colonies, is a matter of great importance, and has been the &s;ubject of much di&s;pute and &s;peculation in times pa&s;t. The debate is now clo&s;ed, re&s;pect|ing this grand point; for, after mature deliberation, the American Congre&s;s, ne|ce&s;&s;itated thereto by the wanton, cruel, and unprovoked conduct of the king and parliament of Great-Britain, have declared the&s;e Colonies totally Independent on, and unconnected with that State, and now mean to con&s;ider and treat them like other
<PB N="6" REF="015710_0006_0F99DDA66B54E158">
nations and &s;tates, as "enemies in war, in peace; friends,"</P>
<P>THE words of my text are peculiarly &s;uitable for the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;uch an event. The &s;tory of which, what I have read, is but a part, we have at large in the preceeding part of this chapter. The &s;um of it is this; Rehoboam reigned in the &s;tead of Solomon, his Father, king over all I&s;rael. Upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, the people by the repre&s;entatives of their &s;everal tribes, petition the king for redre&s;s of their grievances, they complain of the la&s;t reign; they addre&s;s Rehoboam for relief, and upon condition of its being granted, they will continue their allegiance to the hou&s;e of David. Rehoboam con&s;ulted with them about him; the grave experienced men of his council advi&s;ed him&punc; by all means, to give the petitioners a kind an&s;wer, and this would &s;ecure them in <HI>his</HI> intere&s;t, "They will be thy &s;ervants for ever," &s;ay the&s;e wi&s;e coun&s;ellors. But this coun&s;el of the old man he regards not, he for&s;akes, and takes advice of the "young men who were grown up with him, and who
<PB N="9" REF="015710_0007_0F99DDA72A3177C8" MS="y">
&s;tood before him," to <HI>them</HI> he adhered, who urged har&s;h and rigorous mea&s;ures, and advi&s;ed to the impo&s;ition of far hea|vier taxes. He an&s;wered the people agree|able to &s;uch weak and fooli&s;h coun&s;els. He threatned not only to &s;queze them by heavy taxes, but to cha&s;ti&s;e them with cruel laws, and &s;evere executions thereof. Thus was Rehoboam infatuated in his coun&s;els and mea&s;ures, and hereby the righteous de&s;igns of the Supreme Ruler of the world were fulfilled. "It was from the Lord." He left Rehoboam to his own fol|ly, and hid from his eyes the things which belonged to his peace, that the kingdom might be rent from him, agreeable to God's threatning, related in the preceed|ing chapter. God often &s;erves his own wi&s;e and righteous purpo&s;es, by the im|prudence and wickedne&s;s of men, and &s;nares &s;inners in the works of their own hands. When the ten tribes of I&s;rael were thus roughly an&s;wered, and threat|ned, they all as one <HI>declare</HI> a revolt from Rehoboam, and the two tribes who ad|hered to him, and &s;et up a &s;eparate king|dom, and independent &s;tate, as the text teaches us. They highly re&s;ented the
<PB N="10" REF="015710_0008_0F99DDA84EDE6198">
provocation which Rehoboam gave them, were incen&s;ed at his menaces, concluded that <HI>that</HI> government, in its progre&s;s, would be intolerably grievous, which, in the beginning, was &s;o very imperious and haughty, and therefore re&s;olve no longer to yield allegiance and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a Tyrant. By the way, we need not won|der that the ten tribes of I&s;rael fall off from the hou&s;e of David, if the hou&s;e of David fall away from the great end of their advancement to rule and authority which was "to be mini&s;ters of God, for good to the people."</P>
<P>My view, in further di&s;cour&s;ing upon this &s;crap of &s;acred &s;tory, is to apply the revolt of the ten tribes of I&s;rael from Re|hoboam, (as far as it will apply) to the Thirteen Colonies of North-America, re|nouncing "all allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown, and totally di&s;&s;olving all political connection between them and the &s;tate of Great-Britain, and declaring them&s;elves Free and Independent States, ve&s;ted with the full powers, privileges and preroga|tives belonging to &s;eperate &s;tates, and en|deavour to ju&s;tify this mea&s;ure to the world. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that
<PB N="11" REF="015710_0009_0F99DDA8CC670898" MS="y">
the&s;e two ca&s;es are exactly parallel; it is &s;ufficient if they are &s;o in the main points.</P>
<P>Let it then be ob&s;erved, in the fir&s;t place, that this fooli&s;h and wicked Rhehoboam was the <HI>third</HI> king of that hou&s;e and fa|mily. When the people of I&s;rael fooli&s;h|ly and impiou&s;ly a&s;ked God to give them a king, hereby rejecting the kingly govern|ment of the mo&s;t high, God conde&s;cend|ed to gratify their de&s;ire, after previou&s;|ly warning them of what would be the certain con&s;equences of their unhappy choice; they would be &s;uch as, if they had any rea&s;on left, and would con&s;ult their own intere&s;t, they would withdraw their petition, and de&s;ire rather to conti|nue as they were. They notwith&s;tand|ing, per&s;i&s;ted in their demand, and God gave them a king, but in his anger, and as a great &s;courge and cur&s;e to them. The fir&s;t king of I&s;rael was Saul, the &s;on of Ki&s;h, a Benjamite. He was a &s;illy prince, infatuated in his councils, invad|ed by his neghbours, de&s;erted by his &s;ol|diers, di&s;ordered in his own &s;pirit, &s;acri|ficeing in confu&s;ion, and rejected of God from being king. After this, God directs Samuel to anoint David king, the young|e&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="015710_0010_0F99DDA9767C3A18">
&s;on of Je&s;&s;e, of another family. David was in the main a good king, though he had his faults.</P>
<P>SOLOMON, his &s;on by Bath&s;heba, the wife of Uriah, reigned over I&s;rael, after the death of David. He was a wi&s;e and good king, and in general ruled well. Indeed he was led away, by his wives, from God, for which he threatned to rend ten tribes from him, and give to his &s;ervant Jeroboam, though not in his day, And further, it &s;eems probable, there were &s;ome things in his reign greivous and op|pre&s;&s;ive to the people; for when Rehoboam &s;on of Solomon, came to the throne of I&s;rael upon his father's death, the people petition him to relax &s;omewhat the griev|ous &s;ervice of the former reign. "Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous &s;ervice of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter, and we will &s;erve thee." But Rehoboam hearkned not unto the people, but threatned them with in|tolerable burdens and impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Let us apply this:</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent king of Great-Britain is the <HI>third</HI> prince of the hou&s;e of Hanover.
<PB N="13" REF="015710_0011_0F99DDAA2C99FFD0" MS="y">
George Lewis, Elector of Hanover, &s;uc|ceeded Queen Ann. He was &s;ucceeded, in the throne, by his &s;on George the &s;econd. The reigns of the&s;e two Georges were to|lerably good. Pa&s;&s;ing by the cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures adopted with re&s;pect to the&s;e Colonies, in the reigns of the inglo|rious Stuart family, from whence, under God, the Revolution delivered us; It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that acts were made in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> reigns of Georges, fir&s;t and &s;econd, called <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ts of trade, whereby our commerce &s;uffered u&s;ele&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ive re&s;trictions: yet &s;till we &s;ubmitted without complaint or petition, for when the pre&s;ent king came to the throne, &s;ucceeding his grand-father, we did not reque&s;t him to make "the grievous &s;ervice, and heavy yoke, lighter," which his predece&s;&s;ors had put upon us: and had not <HI>"his</HI> little &s;inger been thicker than their loins," we &s;hould never have di&s;turbed the royal car with petitions and complaints, nor would George the third, have lo&s;t the bigger and better half of his kingdom. Had no mea&s;ures been pur&s;ued with regard to the&s;e &s;tates, more grievous than were adopted before the year 1763. we had &s;till owned George
<PB N="14" REF="015710_0012_0F99DDAAE5F6FA98">
for our rightful &s;overeign. For, as the people, at fir&s;t emigrated chiefly from Great-Britain and Ireland, they ever (un|til now) held under the crown thereof, and acknowledged the &s;ame king, with the other tribes beyond the atlantic. But &s;oon after he came to the throne of his ance&s;tors, he di&s;covered an haughty and de&s;potic &s;pirit and behaviour. He, like Rehoboam, for&s;ook the coun&s;el of the old men, and followed the impolitic advice of his young mates, and his pre|ceptor. In the reign of George the &s;e|cond, the Briti&s;h empire was carried to its height and perfection in glory, re|nown, wealth, grandeur, and extent of dominion, through the wi&s;e coun&s;els, and prudent management of that able &s;tate&s;|man and coun&s;ellor, Mr. PITT, now Earl of Chatham, of immortal memory. He had the whole conducting of the la&s;t war, and by his &s;ound judgment and &s;kill, and uncorruptible patrioti&s;m, under God, enabled Great-Britain to conquer the united powers of France and Spain, to &s;pread terror through the world, and add to her dominions an immen&s;e extent of territory in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies, and
<PB N="15" REF="015710_0013_0F99DDABA72C9C38">
in North-America. He put it into the power of Britain to make the mo&s;t ho|norable and gainful peace, at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war; but Lord Bute, the king's preceptor, &s;ent plenipotentiary to the treaty at Paris, con&s;ents to the mo&s;t in|glorious terms.</P>
<P>THE kingdom was a long time in com|ing to that pitch of grandeur and pro&s;pe|rity, to which, in divine providence, it was exalted at the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent king: but it &s;oon began to decline. The old men, the able coun&s;ellors who &s;tood before <HI>his</HI> grandfather, and to whom the nation was greatly indebted, were di&s;|carded, neglected. Though they have ever given their be&s;t advice to the king, urging &s;uch mild, conciliatory mea&s;ures as would have &s;ecured to him the allegiance and affection of all his &s;ubjects, yet their coun&s;els were reprobated, while the young, inexperienced men, who grew up with him, he has ever con&s;ulted, and their ad|vice he has &s;teadily followed through the whole of his reign. The people of England and America have had con&s;tant cau&s;e for complaints and petitions; for his reign has been one continued &s;eries of oppre&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="16" REF="015710_0014_0F99DDAD028D9080">
and u&s;urpations. Bute, Hill&s;bo|rough and North, with their dete&s;table Junto, have advi&s;ed to oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures of taxation, in America, and when we have petitioned for redre&s;s, they have urged fur|ther har&s;h and vigorous methods, and when we have attempted to defeat the operation of their acts they have advi&s;ed to the mo&s;t wanton and cruel puni&s;hments: So that we have had ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint; to &s;how which we need only mention what he and his parliament have done, leaving an impartial world to judge whether we have not &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to reject him, as our king, and to &s;et up as free and in|dependent &s;tates, &s;aying, "What portion have we in George? neither have we in|heritance in the hou&s;e of Hanover; to your tents O Americans, and now &s;ee to thine own hou&s;e George."

<P>BUT &s;ome pretend to ju&s;tify the admi|ni&s;tration in Great-Britain, with &s;aying, we have, by our abu&s;ive treatment of the king's &s;ervants, provoked government to treat us with &s;uch unexampled &s;everity: Our troubles, &s;ay they, we have brought upon our&s;elves, and the various acts of king and parliament aro&s;e from our op|po&s;ition to government. To this objec|tion, let me an&s;wer, That, notwith&s;tand|ing certain acts of trade which were griev|ous and oppre&s;&s;ive, the people pre&s;erved due decorum, and were peaceable and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive until 1764. The Briti&s;h ad|mini&s;tration began its attacks on our li|berties with a &s;tamp-act, but meeting with &s;trong oppo&s;ition, they thought fit to re|peal it. This act threw the colonies into &s;trong convul&s;ions, and we rejoiced ex|ceedingly on its repeal, fondly hoping we &s;hould enjoy future tranquility. But we were mi&s;taken. They never intended to relinqui&s;h their de&s;ign, but only to
<PB N="22" REF="015710_0020_0F99DDB8807E4FF0">
change their ground, that, which they fir&s;t pitched upon, not &s;eeming tenable. An American revenue granted by a Bri|ti&s;h parliament was the object, and they never lo&s;t &s;ight of it: for &s;oon renewed their attacks, upon principles which they thought more favourable to their inten|tions: but they met with as little &s;ucce&s;s in this as in their former attempt.

But when rulers, by leaping the bounds of con&s;titution, violate the covenant or com|pact, between them, and the people; the people are di&s;charged from their oath of alle|giance,

I further add, this objection, if it proves any thing in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, proves too much; it proves that GEORGE the third, has no <HI>right</HI> to the Briti&s;h crown, but that <HI>that</HI> is the right, the inheritance of the immediate heir of JAMES the &s;econd, or &s;omebody el&s;e, no mortal can tell who.&mdash;But after all it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;atisfy &s;ome people.</P>
<P>There are among us, men who profe&s;&s;ed to be friends to their country, and who <HI>&s;ay,</HI> they look upon the acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, we complain of, as cruel, un|con&s;titutional and oppre&s;&s;ive, and yet find fault with every &s;tep we take, with every mea&s;ure we pur&s;ue, and endeavor to di&s;|courage people from attempting deliver|ance therefrom. But how can &s;uch men reconcile their profe&s;&s;ion and their conduct? They point out no other way wherein to look for, or expect relief. If they mu&s;t find fault let them &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome &s;teps and mea|&s;ures
<PB N="42" REF="015710_0040_0F99DDCCE5A3C5D0" MS="y">
for public con&s;ideration, which they think advi&s;eable to take. But it is not a little vain and arrogant for men, totally unacquainted with public affairs, the af|fairs of the State, and with the world, and who &s;eldom go beyond the &s;moak of their own chimnies, to pretend to arraign the wi&s;dom of the Congre&s;s, the wi&s;dom of the Continent. We are remarkably united in the mea&s;ures taken: We have petitioned, we have remon&s;trated: We have tried every way for relief: We have been dri|ven to arms: We have been forced to an independency. Still the men cry out; nothing is conducted as it ought to be: We are all undone! "Doubtle&s;s they are the men, and wi&s;dom will die with them." I grant all men have a right to canva&s;s public mea&s;ures, and to &s;peak their minds. But then there is a deference due to the public judgment. Individuals, who di&s;&s;ent, &s;hould do it with mode&s;ty and &s;elf-diffi|dence, as not being certain but others may know <HI>as well,</HI> if not <HI>much better</HI> than they. If they prote&s;t, let them give their rea&s;ons, otherwi&s;e they had better be totally &s;ilent.</P>
<P>But not to enlarge. From what has been &s;aid above, from plain undeniable
<PB N="43" REF="015710_0041_0F99DDCD6878E2B8" MS="y">
facts, it is evident the&s;e colonies <HI>will</HI> and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be ju&s;tified, by the whole candid and impartial world in declaring them&s;elves free and independent States, ab&s;olved from all allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown, and to|tally di&s;connected with the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now make a few reflections upon, and inference from what has been offered.</P>
<P>It is a natural inference from &s;acred &s;tory, and from what has been &s;aid above, that kingly government is not agreeable to the divine will, and is often a very great evil. The will of God as made known by Gideon; and the prophet Sa|muel expre&s;sly di&s;approves of government by kings. "Near three thou&s;and years pa&s;&s;ed away from the Mo&s;aic account of the creation, <HI>before</HI> the Jews under a na|tional delu&s;ion, a&s;ked a king,&mdash;'Till then their form of government (except in ex|traordinary ca&s;es where the Almighty in|terpo&s;ed) was a kind of republic admini&s;|tred by a judge, and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it was held &s;inful to acknowledge any being under that title but the Lord of ho&s;ts. And when a man &s;eriou&s;ly reflects on the
<PB N="44" REF="015710_0042_0F99DDCE2A5163A8">
idolatrous homage paid to the per&s;ons of kings, we need not wonder that the Al|mighty, ever jealous of his honor, &s;hould di&s;approve of a form of government which &s;o impiou&s;ly invades the prerogative of heaven." No form of government but kingly or monarchial, is an inva&s;ion of God's prerogative; this is. It will be vain to alledge, in proofs of the divine approbation of kingly government, that we are commanded to <HI>pray</HI> for kings, and to <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> unto kings. For, when in their folly, and "&s;trong delu&s;ion," a people fix upon kingly, monarchial government, they mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it, <HI>pray</HI> that their king may reign in righteou&s;ne&s;s and rule with judgment, and mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his rule and authority, <HI>&s;o long</HI> as it can be done con&s;i&s;tent with their duty to them|&s;elves, to po&s;terity, to mankind and to God. The mo&s;t high over all the earth, gave kings at fir&s;t, to the Jews (as he &s;ends war) in anger, and as a judgment, and it may be affirmed, that upon the whole, they have been a &s;courge to the inhabi|tants of the earth ever &s;ince. We in the&s;e States, are now evidently under the frowns of heaven for our many and great
<PB N="45" REF="015710_0043_0F99DDCF9D8C7018" MS="y">
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: it is to be hoped we &s;hall not "add to our &s;ins, this evil to a&s;k <HI>us</HI> a king."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be ob&s;erved that new truths are often &s;truck out by the colli&s;ion of parties, in the eagerne&s;s of controver&s;y, which otherwi&s;e would have lain hid. The divine di&s;approbation of a form of government by kings, I take to be one of this &s;ort of truths. The times have led to a free inquiry into the origin, nature and de&s;ign of civil government, and into the various forms which have obtained in the &s;everal ages of the world, and into the divine hereditary right of kings. And, I am fully convinced, the more this &s;ubject is controver&s;ed and con&s;idered, the clearer it will appear to unprejudiced minds, that kingly government is in fact contrary to the mind and will of God.</NOTE></P>
<P>Again, we may infer that however faulty the king may be, and although he has forfeited the allegiance, and affection of this people, yet they who have advi&s;ed him to &s;uch acts, and to &s;uch har&s;h and rigorous mea&s;ures, as have divided the kingdom, and brought us into this condi|tion, are veryly guilty in the &s;ight of God, and mu&s;t, with the king, an&s;wer another day before God, for all the evil con&s;e|quences of their wicked advice, and ra&s;h conduct, and e&s;pecially for that torrent of human blood with which our land is deluging. The acts of the Briti&s;h parlia|ment, and the mea&s;ures taken again&s;t us, have been mo&s;tly &s;ugge&s;ted, contrived, and urged by the notoriou&s;ly infamous
<PB N="46" REF="015710_0044_0F99DDCFBADFE640">
Hutchin&s;on (late governor of this province) and his minions of this country, and fur|thered by men in place and power in Great-Britain. Leaving our <HI>other</HI> ene|mies; the crimes of &s;uch as are of this land, who have been plotting their coun|try's ruin, &s;eem to pur&s;ue the&s;e bloody men, they are fallen into the pit they were digging for others, they are the mo&s;t and <HI>greate&s;t</HI> of them bani&s;hed their native land, and fair inheritances; many of them de&s;titute, afflicted, tormented, and the voice of their brethren's blood, &s;hed greatly by their means, crieth unto God from the ground. Nor are they entire|ly guiltle&s;s, let me here &s;ay, who, among our&s;elves, &s;eem to think the war in which we are engaged, not ju&s;t, or the attempt impracticable, and therefore will not a&s;i&s;t in our defence when our <HI>all</HI> is at &s;take, but &s;tand aloof from our troubles, and wi&s;h well to the cau&s;e of our adver&s;aries. They who decline the &s;ervice, and will not lend an helping hand, while we are &s;truggling for life, mu&s;t expect to meet with &s;ome heavy judgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges v. 23.</NOTE> "Cur&s;e ye Meroz (&s;aid the angel of the Lord) cur&s;e ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, becau&s;e

they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord again&s;t the mighty." If our cau&s;e be good and ju&s;t (and who can deny this) if heaven has conducted us to an independency, if this "cau&s;e is from God," as the revolt of the ten tribes was, if when the &s;alvation of our country calls for our aid, we refu&s;e it, thro' oppo&s;ition, cowardice, or any other cau&s;e, the cur&s;e of God will pur&s;ue us. "Cur&s;ed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully, and cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his &s;word from blood."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah XLVIII, 10,</NOTE></P>
<P>Once more, As we have been nece&s;&s;i|tated to &s;eparate from Great-Britain, we mu&s;t make the be&s;t of a &s;tate of Indepen|dency. Notwith&s;tanding we give up that <HI>&s;tate</HI> with reluctance; yet I am fully convinced that Independency is, in every view, the intere&s;t of America. If any among us are de&s;irous of being &s;atisfied that this is our intere&s;t, and that we are able to &s;upport our&s;elves therein, under the patronage of that infinitely wi&s;e Being who has brought us hitherto, let them dive&s;t them&s;elves of prejudice and prepo|&s;ition, and read that incomparable pam+phlet called <HI>"Common Sen&s;e,"</HI> with its ad|ditions,
<PB N="48" REF="015710_0046_0F99DDD2EEE3A1B0">
and they will have all the &s;atis|faction they can rea&s;onably demand. Some among us think we do but dream, when we talk of &s;upporting our&s;elves as a &s;eparate people:&mdash;They have thought &s;o in other in&s;tances, and lived to &s;ee, what they called our dreams, come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Let me here &s;ubjoin, that &s;ince this mighty revolution has taken place in A|merica, there mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be a change in our modes of civil government; and this is a matter of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, as to this life, and ought to engage our clo&s;e&s;t attention. It will be unpardona|ble in us to &s;ubmit to tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion within, when we are hazarding every thing dear to us, to defend our|&s;elves again&s;t it from without. A plan of government will &s;oon be laid before the people of this State, for their con&s;i|deration. Let us not ha&s;tily adopt any one form; and while we reject the defects, let us pre&s;erve the virtues and excellen|cies of our ancient mode. Let us cooly examine, and thoroughly weigh the plans already adopted by any &s;i&s;ter States, and improve upon them. And whatever form we fix upon, let us be peculiarly careful
<PB N="49" REF="015710_0047_0F99DDD38FD9FFA8" MS="y">
that every part of the State is fully and freely repre&s;ented in our legi&s;lative A&s;|&s;embly. A large and full repre&s;entation of a people, is of the greate&s;t importance to the State. The people ought to re|tain in their own hands a check upon the legi&s;lative powers, by having their elec|tions very frequent, at lea&s;t, once in a year. This is a <HI>right</HI> we &s;hould be pecu|liarly tenacious of, nor <HI>ever</HI> upon <HI>any</HI> con|&s;ideration, give it up. Power is too in|toxicating, to be committed for <HI>any</HI> great length of time, to the hands of <HI>any</HI> man, or <HI>any</HI> body of men, Long parliaments are fountains of corruption and venality, are totally incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty in the people, and in time, fail not to work the ruin of a State. Further, if the form of government we &s;hall adopt, con&s;i&s;t of more than one branch, each ought to be entirely independent of, that it may not in the lea&s;t be influenced by the other. Hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in legi&s;latures, this people mu&s;t be greatly deluded ever to admit of. In a word, the plan of govern|ment ought to be noble and generous, &s;ecuring equal liberty and happine&s;s, both civil and religious, to every individual;
<PB N="50" REF="015710_0048_0F99DDD5D5F8D508" MS="y">

Religious intollerance in any &s;ect, is a &s;ufficient, <HI>and the only</HI> rea&s;on why that &s;ect ought not to be tole|rated. This might ea&s;ily be made evident, but would require a treati&s;e by it&s;elf. They who want further &s;atisfaction upon points of this nature, I would refer to that ine&s;timable volume, entitled <HI>"The Palladium of Con&s;cience."</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Finally, Since we are become indepen|dent on an earthly power, we eminently need the divine favor, &s;miles, protection and ble&s;&s;ing, and &s;hould be concerned, therefore to conduct in &s;uch a manner as to &s;ecure the &s;ame. As our revolt is, undoubtedly, of God, he is &s;aying to us this day, as he &s;aid to Jeroboam and the ten tribes of I&s;rael, "It &s;hall be if you will hearken unto all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my &s;ight, to keep my &s;tatutes and com|mandments, that I will be with you, and build you up." To e&s;tabli&s;h our&s;elves in our Independency let us not take ways and mea&s;ures which are &s;inful, as Jeroboam and the ten tribes of I&s;rael did. Let us be care|ful to profe&s;s, maintain, encourage, and promote the Prote&s;tant religion, as far as
<PB N="51" REF="015710_0049_0F99DDD72D1B7C40" MS="y">
in us lieth, in oppo&s;ition to Heatheni&s;m, all Idolatry. That we may be &s;upported, let us not too much countenance, and encourage &s;uch neighbours and &s;tates, as are enemies to the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e and intere&s;t; le&s;t, if we &s;hould, we be tempt|ed to depart from the living God. God has ever been the friend and patron of the American I&s;rael, and he will continue &s;o, if we act up to our character and obli|gation. "The Lord is with you, while you be with him, and if you &s;eek him, he will be found of you: But if you for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chronicles XV. 2.</NOTE> As &s;aid Aza|riah unto A&s;a, and all Judah and Benja|min. It is of more importance for us to keep in covenant with God, and to be upon good terms with heaven, than to be in league and friend&s;hip with the mo&s;t potent States. Let us be careful to keep up among us, the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t pure and uncorrupted by human additi|ons or mixtures, and the wor&s;hip of God unadulterated, and then the God, "In whom our fathers tru&s;ted, and were deli|vered," will delight to build us up, and to plant us; he will give us &s;ucce&s;s in the pre&s;ent war, he will rebuke the king and

He will di&s;ap|point the devices of our enemies, and make them to be at peace with us." "If God be thus for us, who can be again&s;t us."
