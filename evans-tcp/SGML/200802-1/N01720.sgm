<P><HI>Our Great SAVIOUR, The Great GOD our SAVIOUR, bringing His People into a Covenant of Grace, does mo&s;t graciou&s;ly MARRY Him&s;elf unto them.</HI></P>
<P>It is to <HI>di&s;til as the &s;mall rain upon the tender Herb.</HI> And therefore it &s;hall be broken into &s;ome Heart-melting Propo|&s;itions.</P>

World, into His <HI>Covenant,</HI> that our SA|VIOUR &s;ays, <HI>I Marry my &s;elf unto you.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Church,</HI> that has this Dignity put upon it; Rev. XXI. 9. <HI>The Wi&s;e to the Lamb of GOD.</HI> Of the <HI>Church</HI> does our SAVI|OUR &s;ay, 'Tis <HI>the dearly Beloved of my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Church Univer&s;al</HI> is to be fir&s;t of all con&s;idered, as thus <HI>Married</HI> unto the Son of GOD. Even that whole Body of People, who come into the Hands of our SAVIOUR, that &s;o they may <HI>glorify God, and enjoy Him forever.</HI> There is a COVE|NANT, which GOD our SAVIOUR has made with His Eternal FATHER, con|cerning a people, which he has cho&s;en, to be the <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of mercy in Glory</HI> forever. In this <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> GOD our SAVIOUR has engaged, That He will recover this His People out of the <HI>Ruins,</HI> which by their departure from God they are fallen into; That He will there|fore make Expiation for their offences, by the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of Him&s;elf, and &s;o recon|cile them unto God: And that He will then put the <HI>Fear of God</HI> into their hearts, and <HI>&s;hew them the path of Life,</HI> and <HI>Quic|ken</HI> them to live unto God, and at la&s;t

rai&s;e them from the dead unto <HI>Everla&s;t|ing Life.</HI> In every Age, and in every Place, the Almighty Spirit of God, finds out the&s;e <HI>Elect,</HI> and makes them willing, that GOD their SAVIOUR &s;hould ac|compli&s;h the&s;e His Engagements for them; willing to be <HI>Sav'd,</HI> and <HI>Led,</HI> and <HI>Rul'd</HI> by this mighty SAVIOUR. The <HI>method of Grace,</HI> which the <HI>Covenant of Redemption</HI> has laid out, for our Salva|tion by a Glorious CHRIST, is brought unto us, in the <HI>Go&s;pel of our Salvation,</HI> as a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> which we are to come into. The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God; it brings to us a <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> By being made willing to have our Saviour do for us, what He has pro|mi&s;ed His Father to do for His People, and be concerned for us, as our <HI>Peace-ma|ker,</HI> our <HI>In&s;tructor,</HI> and our <HI>Governour;</HI> we come into His <HI>Covenant.</HI> The People brought into this Covenant is the Church of God. Now, unto this whole People does our dear Saviour &s;ay, I <HI>Marry my &s;elf unto you.</HI></P>
<P>There is one whole Book of our BI|BLE that appears written on purpo&s;e to Repre&s;ent and Celebrate, this Heavenly
<PB N="8" REF="002040_0009_0FBA855DB8CD9870">
my&s;tery. Tis the Book which we call, <HI>The</HI> CANTICLES. In that <HI>Song of Songs,</HI> written by <HI>Solomon,</HI> there is introduced a <HI>Prince,</HI> who has upon him &s;ome Re|&s;emblance of <HI>David,</HI> the admired Father of <HI>Solomon;</HI> but yet it is in the Quality and Apparel of an <HI>High-prie&s;t</HI> that this <HI>Prince</HI> is here exhibited. And this Illu&s;|trious Per&s;on here <HI>Marries</HI> Him&s;elf unto a Lady, with many mutual Endearments. Tis our SAVIOUR, who is the <HI>Bridegroom;</HI> 'Tis the Church which is the <HI>Bride,</HI> in this <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poem. The <HI>Emblem</HI> thus pro&s;ecuted by <HI>Solomon,</HI> is but an Enlarge|ment upon what he had learn'd from the <HI>Forty fifth P&s;alm,</HI> which his Father <HI>Da|vid</HI> had compo&s;ed for him. From hence it is that the Jews have their curious Traditions, of the <HI>Marriage</HI> between <HI>Ti|pheret</HI> and <HI>Malcuth;</HI> between the <HI>Beauty</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> that is to &s;ay, between the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> and the <HI>People</HI> that &s;ubmit unto Him. We have now and then occur|ring in our Sacred Pages, the <HI>Marriage</HI> of an <HI>Hero,</HI> which is attended with cir|cum&s;tances, that lead us to think, on our Saviour &s;aying to His People, <HI>I Mar|ry my &s;elf unto you.</HI> The Condition of
<PB N="9" REF="002040_0010_0FBA8560A30FB928">
things between our Saviour, and the Peo|ple of His Covenant, is the Original from whence the <HI>Marriage</HI> allow'd and or|dain'd, and common among the children of Men, is <HI>Copied.</HI> But the mo&s;t notable <HI>Copy</HI> taken from that <HI>Original,</HI> was the <HI>Marriage</HI> of our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents,</HI> in the Gar|den of God. Of that <HI>marriage,</HI> our Apo|&s;tle &s;peaking, pre&s;ently adds; Eph. V. 32. <HI>This is a great My&s;tery; but I &s;peak of Chri&s;t and the Church.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Inchoation</HI> of this <HI>Marriage,</HI> is in <HI>this World.</HI> The <HI>Elect</HI> of God coming to &s;ay, <HI>I am the Lords,</HI> and <HI>Avouching</HI> a Glo|rious CHRIST for their God and Saviour, the Grand Affair of the <HI>Marriage</HI> is car|ried on. 'Tis come to a Contraction. But the con&s;ummation of the <HI>Marriage</HI> is in the <HI>World to come.</HI> 'Twill be at the <HI>Second Coming</HI> of our Saviour, that there will be that <HI>voice</HI> heard, as the <HI>voice of many waters,</HI> and the <HI>voice of mighty Thun|derings;</HI> Rev. XIX. 7. <HI>Let us be glad &amp; rejoyce, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His Wife has made her&s;elf ready.</HI> Then, then, twill be that our Saviour will <HI>pre&s;ent it unto Him&s;elf a Glorious Church,</HI> not having any thing that will
<PB N="10" REF="002040_0011_0FBA8561AA4359E8">
be di&s;ta&s;teful unto Him&punc; Then, then 'twill be, that our Saviour will call her <HI>Heph|zibah</HI> and <HI>Beulah,</HI> becau&s;e He will <HI>De|light</HI> in His <HI>Church,</HI> and it &s;hall be <HI>Mar|ried</HI> unto Him: yea, <HI>as a Bridegroom re|joyceth over the Bride, &s;o &s;hall thy God Rejoyce over thee.</HI></P>
<P>But as an <HI>Appendix,</HI> to this Contemp|lation, it is to be added; That a <HI>parti|cular Church,</HI> is al&s;o to be con&s;idered, as <HI>Married</HI> unto the SON of GOD. A <HI>par|ticular Church,</HI> or a Company of whom our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>Gather my Saints toge|ther unto me, tho&s;e that have made a Cove|nant with me by Sacrifice:</HI> Even to &s;uch a company combined in the Evangelical <HI>Church-State,</HI> our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>I Marry my &s;elf unto you.</HI> Of &s;uch a Church, He who gathered it, &s;aid, 2 Cor. XI. 2. I <HI>have e&s;pou&s;ed you to one Husband, that I may pre&s;ent you as a Cha&s;te Virgin, to CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord; Remember thy <HI>Marriage</HI> unto thy Saviour. Do nothing to grieve Him; Do not Incur His Frowns; Do not provoke Him to withdraw from thee. Be faithful in His <HI>Covenant.</HI> Ob&s;erve His <HI>In&s;titutions,</HI> with a due

Loyalty and Purity; pre&s;erve them from Violations. Be mindful of that Charge; P&s;al. XLV. 11. <HI>He is thy Lord, and Wor&s;hip thou Him.</HI> Thy Title &s;hall be, <HI>An Elect Lady;</HI> yea, Thou &s;halt be a <HI>Kings Daughter,</HI> if thou <HI>Hearken</HI> to &s;uch Ad|monitions of GOD.</P>

And every <HI>Individual Believer</HI> is al&s;o a <HI>Living Temple;</HI> An <HI>Habitation of GOD thro' the Spirit.</HI> It is the &s;ame in the Metaphor of a <HI>Marriage.</HI> Our SAVI|OUR does <HI>Marry</HI> Him&s;elf unto the <HI>Church</HI> in general. But He does al&s;o <HI>Marry</HI> Him|&s;elf to every <HI>Individual Believer,</HI> and &s;ay to every Soul that receives Him as a SAVIOUR, what we have, Cant. IV. 8, 9. <HI>Come with me, my Spou&s;e. Thou ha&s;t ra|vi&s;hed my Heart, my Si&s;ter, my Spou&s;e.</HI> O Sollicited Soul, When thou come&s;t into the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD, and heartily &s;ay&s;t, <HI>I am willing to be Li&s;ted among the People who look for Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s under the Conduct

of the LORD, who is to break the Head of the Serpent;</HI> From this Moment thy SAVIOUR <HI>Marries</HI> Him&s;elf unto thee. When thou come&s;t into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, and heartily &s;ay&s;t, <HI>I am willing that GOD manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h of my JESUS, may produce Good Terms with Heaven for me, and may fulfil in me all the Good Plea&s;ure of His Goodne&s;s;</HI> From this Moment thy SAVIOUR <HI>Marries</HI> Him&s;elf unto thee.

<P>But there mu&s;t be more particularity u&s;ed, that we may have a di&s;tinct view of the <HI>My&s;tical Marriage,</HI> which is now <HI>Pro&s;ecuting;</HI> I hope, I may &s;ay, <HI>Celebra|ting,</HI> and that you may come into it.</P>
<P>O Our Evangelized People, Your Great SAVIOUR does make to every Soul among you, the <HI>Propo&s;al,</HI> O Gracious and Marvellous <HI>Propo&s;al!</HI> of an <HI>E&s;pou&s;al</HI> un|to Him. Your SAVIOUR is this Day fulfilling that Word; Ho&s;. II. 16. <HI>At that Day, &s;aith the Lord, thou &s;halt call me, I&s;hi;</HI> That is to &s;ay, <HI>My Husband.</HI> That ONE WORD heartily &s;poken, will a&s;&s;ure you of His being &s;o.</P>
<P>There is to be a <HI>Regular Proceedure</HI> in the <HI>Marriage.</HI> Wherefore,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; There is the <HI>Fathers Con&s;ent</HI> in the Matter. GOD the FATHER has

given His <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> unto it, that Thy SA|VIOUR &s;hould <HI>Marry</HI> Him&s;elf unto thee. It is a <HI>Match</HI> of the <HI>Fathers</HI> making. We read, Mat. XXII. 2. <HI>A King made a Mar|riage for His Son.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Marriage</HI> of thy SAVIOUR, unto Thee, O thou Soul now under Invitations unto thy SAVI|OUR.

<P>A <HI>Marriage</HI> carried on, with &s;uch a Regard unto the <HI>Second Adam</HI> in it; what a Rare Cour&s;e is herein taken, to abate, and prevent, much of the <HI>Cur&s;e,</HI> which every <HI>Marriage</HI> in <HI>this World,</HI> is likely to be more or le&s;s Encumbred &amp; Embittered withal! What a Rare Cour&s;e is taken, that in&s;tead of cau&s;e to have it &s;aid, <HI>It is Good that a Man &s;hould not touch a Marriage,</HI> it &s;hall &s;till hold Good, <HI>It is not Good for Man to be alone!</HI></P>
<P>What a rare cour&s;e is taken that the <HI>Marriage</HI> may have all the Gracious Ends of it an&s;wered! Yea, What <HI>Mira|cles</HI> will be wrought in and for a <HI>Mar|riage</HI> which thus has the pre&s;ence of our JESUS at it! By &s;uch PIETY, My Friends, you will al&s;o prepare your &s;elves for that <HI>Higher State</HI> in which <HI>they Marry not, nor are given in Marriage, but are Equal to the Angels of GOD.</HI></P>
