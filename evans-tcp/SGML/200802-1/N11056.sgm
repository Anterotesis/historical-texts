<HEAD>PRAYER before SERMON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>O THOU eternal and exhau&s;tle&s;s &s;ource of light, and life, and love! In thee we live and move and have our being! Every moment deals to us a portion of thy boun|ty, and demands the tribute of uncea&s;ing prai&s;e! Thy name is</HI> LOVE! <HI>And</HI> LOVE <HI>the e&s;&s;ence of thy nature! The religion thou ha&s;t taught us is a religion of love! And love is the principle and end of all thy di&s;pen&s;ations!</HI></P>
<P>NEVER <HI>do&s;t thou &s;end thy judgments abroad into the world, never do&s;t thou &s;uffer thy cha&s;ti&s;ing hand to fall heavy up|on thy children, but when they become in&s;en&s;ible of that endearing relation, in which they &s;tand to thee and to each other, and thus violate thy eternal living law of love!</HI></P>
<P>WE <HI>acknowledge, therefore, and adore thy wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in the infliction
<PB N="iv" REF="014012_0003_0F92877CAFE82130">
of national puni&s;hments upon national guilt! Our eyes mu&s;t be blinded, and our hearts hardened indeed, if we do not &s;ee and feel, under our pre&s;ent vi&s;itation, the manife&s;t tokens of thy divine di&s;plea&s;ure!</HI></P>
<P>WE <HI>own and lament, that the dark cloud of judgment, which now hangs over our heads, hath ri&s;en from our unnumber|ed &s;ins and rebellions again&s;t thee! Again&s;t thee only have we &s;inned! To thee only have we been di&s;obedient and ungrateful. We have neglected to improve under thy pa&s;t corrections. We have &s;hamefully &s;lighted thy pa&s;t loving-kindne&s;&s;es. Our pro&s;perity hath rendered us forgetful of thee our</HI> GOD, <HI>regardle&s;s of thine holy ordinances, inattentive to the precepts of thy go&s;pel!</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>yet, &s;pare us, good</HI> LORD, <HI>&s;pare thy people, whom thou ha&s;t redeemed, and let not thine heritage be brought to con|fu&s;ion! Recall thy mini&s;ters of vengeance!
<PB N="v" REF="014012_0004_0F92877F71CA0C48">
And put a &s;top to the unnatural effu&s;ion of chri&s;tian blood!</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>our pre&s;ent grievous calamities, not our merits, but thy mercy, not our fore&s;ight but thy providence alone can de|liver us. Accept, therefore, the prayers and &s;upplications, that have this day been offered at the foot-&s;tool of thy throne! Ac|cept, for thy</HI> WELL-BELOVED'<HI>s &s;ake, our public acts of penitence and humiliation!</HI></P>
<P>GIVE <HI>us grace &s;eriou&s;ly to lay to heart the great danger we are in from our pre|&s;ent unhappy divi&s;ions! Take away all hatred, bitterne&s;s and re&s;entment from our brea&s;ts. Enable us to forgive our of|fending</HI> BRETHREN, <HI>even as we our&s;elves look for forgivene&s;s at the hands of our offended</HI> GOD!</P>
<P>AND <HI>O thou, who alone can&s;t make men to be of one mind in an hou&s;e! Re|&s;tore that brotherly union and concord,
<PB N="vi" REF="014012_0005_0F92878508874DC8">
which ought ever to &s;ub&s;i&s;t inviolate in the great family to which we belong!

<P>FOR <HI>this purpo&s;e we pray, that thou would&s;t give thy ble&s;&s;ing to a preached go&s;pel! Enable thy mini&s;tring &s;ervants of every denomination to be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, in promoting the great work of chri&s;tian love: And whil&s;t they are faithfully employed in planting and watering, do thou,</HI> LORD <HI>of the harve&s;t! crown their labours with a ble&s;&s;ed increa&s;e!</HI></P>

<Q>RETURN, WE BESEECH THEE, O GOD OF HOSTS! LOOK DOWN FROM HEA|VEN, AND BEHOLD AND VISIT THIS VINE!</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF we could retire awhile, my bre|thren, from the &s;phere of political tu|mult, contemplate at lei&s;ure the &s;y|&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and look beyond &s;e|cond cau&s;es for the &s;prings and principles of motion, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s be

able to di&s;cern in almo&s;t every human event, the marks of Sovereign Wi&s;dom, the energy of Infinite Power, and the prevalence of Almighty Good|ne&s;s; and &s;hould thereby be led to ac|knowledge the immediate influence and operation of the great moral Governor.</P>
<P>NOT only the cour&s;e of all public tran&s;actions, the ri&s;e and fall of em|pires and kingdoms app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar to be directed by his omnipotent hand; but his pro|vidence is known to extend to the con|cerns of individuals, to things of the minute&s;t nature, &s;o that, according to the language of in&s;piration, NOT A SPARROW FALLS TO THE GROUND WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE, AND THE VERY HAIRS OF OUR HEADS ARE NUMBERED.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="014012_0009_0F92878804447FB0">
WHAT a &s;cene of di&s;order, ruin and de&s;olation would &s;oon be exhibit|ed upon the theatre of the world, was the ALMIGHTY to withdraw his over|ruling influence! Men, &s;avage in &s;ome degree by nature, and more &s;avage by the growth and indulgence of their evil lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, would &s;oon fall upon each other with a violence and ferocity equal to that of bea&s;ts of prey. Ambition, tyranny and vengeance would rage without controul, and the whole world would, ere long, be de|luged in blood.</P>
<P>HAPPY, however, for mankind, this is not the ca&s;e. An all-wi&s;e and all-powerful Being &s;its at the helm. He pre&s;ides, un&s;een, in the councils of Princes. He pro&s;pers or di&s;appoints them in their projects and undertakings; and renders all the thoughts, intenti|ons

and actions of men &s;ub&s;ervient to the completion of his own mo&s;t wi&s;e and benevolent purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>CONQUEST and defeat, the &s;houts of the victor, and the cries of the van|qui&s;hed are from him. The pro&s;peri|ty of nations and the happine&s;s of in|dividuals, public misfortunes and pri|vate di&s;tre&s;&s;es, plentiful harve&s;ts and years of famine, the ravages of war, and the &s;miles of peace, are all dealt forth by him to the &s;ons of men, at &s;uch times and in &s;uch degrees, as in his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s he finds ex|pedient for their real welfare. Happy, therefore, that people, who, amid all the variety of changes to which go|vernments as well as individuals are expo&s;ed, have placed their &s;ole de|pendence upon the KING OF KINGS!</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014012_0011_0F9287896DF6BD28">
WITH the&s;e principles in our hearts, and with a &s;incere purpo&s;e of HUM|BLING OURSELVES UNDER THE MIGH|TY HAND OF GOD, and imploring his gracious interpo&s;ition under our pre|&s;ent public di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I would fain hope, that we have all THIS DAY EN|TERED THE COURTS OF THE LORD'S HOUSE.</P>
<P>THE trumpet is &s;ound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d in Zion. A Fa&s;t is proclaimed. A &s;olemn a&s;|&s;embly convened. The numerous in|habitants of our exten&s;ive colonies, are now pro&s;trate with us before the Throne of Grace, and jointly lifting up their hands and hearts to Heaven in &s;ome &s;uch &s;upplicatory addre&s;s as this: RETURN, WE BESEECH, THEE, O GOD OF HOSTS! LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN, AND BEHOLD AND VISIT THIS VINE! And would to God! that our united prayers and &s;upplications

might prevail, that the Lord of mercy would incline his ear, and &s;ay to the de&s;troying Angel: IT IS ENOUGH&mdash;STAY NOW THINE HAND.</P>
<P>IN the P&s;alm from whence my text is taken, the Royal Author, after hav|ing enumerated the many di&s;tingui&s;h|ing favours, with which Heaven had heretofore ble&s;&s;ed his church and nati|on, proceeds in the mo&s;t earne&s;t man|ner to deprecate &s;ome grievous calami|ties with which they were at that time oppre&s;&s;ed:</P>
<P>GIVE EAR, O SHEPHERD OF ISRAEL, THOU THAT LEADEST JO|SEPH LIKE A FLOCK; THOU THAT DWELLEST BETWEEN THE CHERU|BIMS, SHINE FORTH!&mdash;THOU HAST BROUGHT A VINE OUT OF EGYPT: THOU HAST CAST OUT THE HEA|THEN AND PLANTED IT; THOU PREPAREDST ROOM FOR IT, AND
<PB N="15" REF="014012_0013_0F92878B0BEAD3B8">
DIDST CAUSE IT TO TAKE DEEP ROOT, AND IT FILLED THE LAND. THE HILLS WERE COVERED WITH THE SHADOW OF IT, AND THE BOUGHS TH<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">REOF WERE LIKE THE GOODLY CEDARS. SHE SENT OUT HER BOUGHS UNTO THE SEA, AND HER BRANCHES UNTO THE RIVER. WHY HAST THOU THEN BROKEN DOWN HER HEDGES, SO THAT ALL THEY THAT PASS BY THE WAY DO PLUCK HER. THE WILD BOAR OUT OF THE WOOD DOTH WASTE IT; AND THE WILD BEAST OF THE FIELD DOTH DEVOUR IT. RETURN, WE BESEECH THEE, O GOD OF HOSTS! LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN, AND BEHOLD AND VISIT THIE VINE!</P>
<P>IN applying this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture to the pre&s;ent &s;olemnity, my ob&s;erva|tions will turn chiefly upon the ble&s;s|ings by which we have hitherto been di&s;tingui&s;hed, the ungrateful returns
<PB N="16" REF="014012_0014_0F92878BB012A400">
we have made to the God of Heaven, for his unmerited goodne&s;s, and the only means by which, as a people, we can be re-in&s;tated in his favour.</P>
<P>I. GREAT and a&s;toni&s;hing have been the ble&s;&s;ings of Providence, by which the&s;e American colonies have been di&s;|tingui&s;hed from their very fir&s;t &s;ettle|ments to the pre&s;ent period. They have indeed been a VINEYARD PLANTED BY THE LORD'S RIGHT HAND. And though &s;ome gloomy &s;cenes have now and then &s;haded the brightne&s;s of the pro&s;pect, yet even the&s;e have great|ly contributed to their pro&s;perity and enlargement.</P>
<P>IF we look back a little into the an|nals of America, we &s;hall find, that this very &s;pot, on which our large and populous city now &s;tands, was, le&s;s than a century ago, a wild unculti|vated de&s;art. The arts and cu&s;toms of
<PB N="17" REF="014012_0015_0F92878C833DD968">
civilized life were here unknown. Nought el&s;e was vi&s;ible, but the &s;ad effects of ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry. The untutor'd &s;avage roamed the wood, like a bea&s;t of prey, &s;tranger to the comforts and advantages of men|tal culture, involved in Pagan dark|ne&s;s, with &s;carcely one ray of heavenly truth to irradiate the gloom of nature.</P>
<P>SUCH was the dark and dreary pro|&s;pect, when Providence conducted our Forefathers to this new world. He took the tender &s;lip from the PARENT VINE. HE CAST OUT THE HEATHEN AND PLANTED IT. THE HILLS WERE SOON COVERED WITH THE SHADOW OF IT, AND THE BOUGHS THEREOF WERE LIKE THE GOODLY CEDARS. SHE SENT OUT HER BOUGHS UNTO THE SEA, AND HER BRANCHES UNTO THE RIVER.&mdash;From NORTH to SOUTH he &s;tretched the exten&s;ive line.&mdash;From EAST to WEST he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad the pro&s;pect open&mdash;
<PB N="18" REF="014012_0016_0F92878D3AEEFD88">
THE WILDERNESS AND SOLITARY PLACE WERE MADE GLAD, AND THE DESART REJOICED AND BLOSSOMED LIKE THE ROSE.</P>
<P>OUR &s;ober Ance&s;tors brought over with them, not only the &s;everal u&s;eful arts and improvements, of which the natives were ignorant, but a trea&s;ure of infinitely greater value, even the char|ter of TEMPORAL FREEDOM, and the records of ETERNAL TRUTH. The banners of CHRISTIAN and BRITISH Liberty were at once unfolded, and the&s;e remote parts of the earth were thereby added to the MESSIAH'S king|dom.</P>
<P>NUMBERLESS, indeed, were the toils, difficulties, and dangers, to which the fir&s;t founders of the&s;e colonies, as well as their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were expo&s;ed, before they arrived at their pre&s;ent height of opulence and &s;plendor. So
<PB N="19" REF="014012_0017_0F92879158E19548">
remarkable, however, were the inter|po&s;itions of Providence, that the mo&s;t inattentive mind mu&s;t have frequently di&s;cerned them.</P>
<P>SCARCELY is there recorded in the annals of hi&s;tory a more rapid &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es of every kind in the &s;ettlement and population of any country on the globe. Whil&s;t favoured with the nur|turing care and protection of the mother country, who&s;e fleets and armies, in conjunction with our own, have ever been faithfully and &s;ucce&s;sfully employ|ed in our defence, our common ene|mies have looked with a&s;toni&s;hment and envy upon our ri&s;ing glory, nor have dared for years to interrupt a re|po&s;e, purcha&s;ed, under the &s;miles of Heaven, by virtue, indu&s;try, and Bri|ti&s;h and American valour.</P>
<P>AND happy, my dear brethren, &s;hould we &s;till remain, if the parent
<PB N="20" REF="014012_0018_0F92879288E9E410">
would be &s;atisfied with &s;uch returns from the children, as filial duty would always prompt them to pay, and not exact &s;uch an illegal and unrighte|ous tribute, as by weakening and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing them, mu&s;t in the end weaken and di&s;tre&s;s the parent too.</P>
<P>HERE then our pre&s;ent calamities commence. Our MORNING JOYS are pa&s;t&mdash;and a NIGHT Of HEAVINESS &s;uc|ceeds&mdash;The HEDGES OF LIBERTY, by which we hoped our VINEYARD was &s;ecured, ARE BROKEN DOWN, and THEY THAT PASS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">Y THE WAY, ARE &s;eeking to PLUCK OUR GRAPES.</P>
<P>'TIS not indeed THE WILD BOAR OUT OF THE WOOD, OR THE WILD BEAST OF THE FIELD, that are ready to WASTE AND DEVOUR IT. 'Tis not now a foreign enemy, or the &s;avages of our own wilderne&s;s, that have made the cruel and unrighteous a&s;&s;ault&mdash;But

it is even, thou, BRITAIN, that with mercile&s;s and unhallowed hands, would&s;t cut down and de&s;troy this BRANCH of thine own VINE, the very BRANCH, which Providence HATH MADE STRONG even FOR THYSELF!</P>
<P>II.

Have we been more zealous for the honour of his go|vernment and the ob&s;ervance of his laws? Have we te&s;tified our zeal by a corre&s;pondent practice?

Hath OUR LIGHT for this purpo&s;e, &s;o SHONE BEFORE MEN, THAT THEY SEEING OUR GOOD WORKS, have been led TO GLORIFY OUR FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN?&mdash;</P>
<P>ALAS! my brethren, have we not rather been &s;o far carried away by the &s;tream of pro&s;perity, as to be forgetful of the &s;ource from whence it was de|rived? So elevated by the pro&s;pect, which peace and a &s;ucce&s;sful commerce have opened to us, as to neglect tho&s;e

Amid the hurry and tumult of the pa&s;&s;ions, hath not con&s;cience fallen a&s;leep? Hath not a fal&s;e &s;ecurity gained ground? And a worldly &s;pirit too generally prevailed?</P>
<P>AND is it not for this, that the AL|MIGHTY hath bared his arm again&s;t us?&mdash;Is it not for this, that he now &s;peaks to us in thunder?

"They are &s;et as watchmen over the hou&s;e of I&s;rael."&mdash;Let them, therefore, CRY ALOUD AND SPARE NOT: let them LIFT UP THEIR VOICE AS A TRUMPET, AND SHEW ISRAEL THEIR TRANSGRESSION, AND THE HOUSE OF JACOB THEIR SIN.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e let the MAGISTRATES take the alarm&mdash;Let them boldly re|buke vice&mdash;Let them puni&s;h immorali|ty and profanene&s;s without re&s;pect to rank or fortune&mdash;Let them become MI|NISTERS

of the GOSPEL as well as MI|NISTERS of JUSTICE&mdash;Let them incul|cate the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, as far as their in|fluence and authority extends.</P>

<P>WE cannot expect, my dear bre|thren, that the GOD OF HOSTS WILL RETURN, LOOK DOWN FROM HEA|VEN, AND BEHOLD AND VISIT OUR VINE; that he will cau&s;e his &s;un to &s;hine, and his refre&s;hing dews and rains to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon it, unle&s;s we are careful to cultivate and improve the &s;oil, and to root out every u&s;ele&s;s nox|ious

<P>BUT whil&s;t I am recommending in general tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential branches of a true reformation, piety and gratitude to GOD, repentance and humiliation for pa&s;t neglects, together with the revival of every private and public virtue, which can adorn and dignify the citi|zen and the chri&s;tian, let me not forget to remind you, at this awful &s;ea&s;on in particular, of the great go&s;pel duty of CHARITY, which will ever prompt us to &s;ympathize with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and to relieve the wants of our brethren.</P>
<P>WHILE pro&s;perity &s;tretches her &s;ilk|en banner over our heads, and admi|ni&s;ters a continual &s;upply of the com|forts

In the&s;e calamitous times at lea&s;t, let us deem it BETTER TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF MOURNING THAN TO THE HOUSE OF FEASTING. Let us chearfully &s;acrifice our hours of entertainment and convi|vial mirth, and be willing to contract our u&s;ual expences, that we may have lei&s;ure TO WEEP WITH THEM THAT WEEP, and have &s;omewhat to &s;pare for the relief of them that want.</P>
<P>FOR, alas! if arms mu&s;t decide the unnatural conte&s;t, and Heaven &s;hould even &s;mile upon our righteous cau&s;e, our &s;ucce&s;s cannot be purcha&s;ed with|out many a tear, on the part of the victor as well as the vanqui&s;hed. An

<P>OUR fa&s;ting and humiliation, there|fore, will &s;tand us in no &s;tead, unle&s;s, whil&s;t we are &s;eeking TO LOOSE THE BANDS OF WICKEDNESS in our own hearts, we endeavour likewi&s;e TO UN|DO THE HEAVY BURDENS OF OTHERS, AND TO LET THE OPPRESSED GO FREE&mdash;unle&s;s we DEAL OUR BREAD TO THE HUNGRY, AND BRING THE POOR THAT ARE CAST OUT INTO OUR HOUSES&mdash;WHEN WE SEE THE NAKED,
