<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>REVELATIONS iii, 22.</BIBL>
<Q>He that hath an ear, let him bear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the Churches.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS book is the revelation, which God gave unto his Son, and which he &s;ent and &s;ignified by his angel unto his &s;ervant John, in the i&s;land of Patmos, to which, for the word of God and the te&s;timony of Je|&s;us, he was bani&s;hed by Domitian, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been about the year 96.</P>
<P>This book contains a wounderful vi&s;ion that St. John had, which opened to him while he was in the &s;pirit on the Lord's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay: It opened with a great voice, as of a trumpet, and with a mo&s;t magnificient appear|ance of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, holding &s;even &s;tars in his right hand, and walking in the mid&s;t of &s;even golden candle&s;ticks, which being too much for mortal eye to endure, John fell at his feet as dead; but our Lord recovered him, and bid him write the things that he revealed.</P>
<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we have &s;even me&s;&s;engers to the &s;even Churches in A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The&s;e epi&s;tles agree much in their general form, but in the matter of addre&s;s vary according as the &s;tate of the churches varied, to whom they were in&s;cribed; and yet often what was &s;aid to one church agreed to others.</P>
<P>In each epi&s;tle he, who walks amid&s;t the golden candle&s;ticks, a&s;&s;ures the churches that he knows their works. Our Lord commends every church except that of the Laodiceans, for &s;omething he found good among them; and reproved every church, except that in Philadelphia, for what he found had among them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="015555_0003_0F99876307A8C508">
By the mo&s;t awful threatenings he warns the remi&s;s; and by the mo&s;t glorious promi&s;es he encourages the faith|ful. The wonderful titles of our Lord, in the&s;e epi&s;tles &s;eem to agree to the particular &s;tate of the churches to which they were &s;ent. Each epi&s;tle was directed to the angel of the church, that is, to the mini&s;ter, who &s;eems to be con&s;idered as a repre&s;etative of the whole church; and yet &s;ome things in the&s;e epi&s;tles might be peculiar|ly applicable to the mini&s;ter him&s;elf. In the clo&s;e of each epi&s;tle we have the &s;olemn injunction in our text: He that hath an ear, let him hear what the &s;pirit faith unto the churches.</P>
<P>That is, let him hear with all attention; God plant|ed the ear for this purpo&s;e and he that does not im|prove it in this manner will &s;oon wi&s;h that he never had an ear. Let him hear what the glorious Immanual, the prince of life &s;aith; this is he which liveth and was dead and is alive forever more, and hath the keys of hell and death; this is al&s;o he which hath the &s;harp &s;word with two edges; let him hear what he &s;aith; his voice is as the &s;ound of many waters; let him hear what he faith in his providences&mdash;what he faith by his &s;pirit in his word, and let him hear what he faith in the&s;e epi&s;tles to the &s;even churches in A&s;ia; let him hear with the ear, under&s;tand with the heart, and make religion the life of his &s;oul. But as the contents of the&s;e epi&s;tles are of general concernment to all churches to the end of the world; let him, let her, let every one that hath an ear hear what the &s;pirit faith to the churches in the pre&s;ent day; what he faith by way of commendation, by way of reproof, by way of coun&s;el, by way of threatening, and by way of encouragement to the faithful.</P>
<P>I. By way of commendation.</P>
<P>Are there any mini&s;ters, churches or private chri&s;tians that have borne, that have patience, and for Chri&s;t's name &s;ake, have laboured and have not fainted; who cannot bear them which are evil, who have tried them which &s;ay they are apo&s;tles and are not, and who hate the corrupt deeds of the Nicholaitans, and the doctrines

Balaam; to you he faith, I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience,</P>
<P>Are there any endowed with true poverty of &s;pirit, and it may be poor in this world's goods, to you he faith, but thou art rich. Are there tho&s;e who have followed Chri&s;t, where Chri&s;t and the world have part|ed, and &s;o have not denied his name; to you he faith, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t kept the word of my truth, I al&s;o will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which &s;hall come upon all the world, to try them which dwell upon the earth.</P>
<P>II. Let us hear what the &s;pirit faith to the churches in this land, by way of reproof and coun&s;el.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider our awful declen&s;ions in religion; if we con&s;ider the righteous frowns of heaven upon us, we &s;hall apprehend that we hear our Lord &s;peaking to us as he did to the church of Ephe&s;us; I have &s;omewhat again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t left thy fir&s;t love; remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent, and do the fir&s;t works. Let all declining chri&s;tians look back and &s;ee the abatement of their former love and zeal for the glorious Immanuel; let them compare their pre&s;ent &s;tate with the former, and &s;ay how much more comfortable it was with them then than now; let them inwardly grieve and mourn before God, and go back &s;tep by &s;tep, till they have gained the ground they have lo&s;t, and do the fir&s;t works again. Let them watch and pray and &s;trive to keep their heart with all diligence, as much as they did before.</P>
<P>Let many prote&s;tant churches remember from whence they have fallen within a century pa&s;t; for the proof of this compare the &s;pirit of their latter and former writings. Let particular churches in this land remember their de|clen&s;ions &s;ince they were fir&s;t planted, and even within thirty years pa&s;t, when the unclean &s;pirit &s;eemed, for a &s;ea&s;on, to be going out of the land; but now he hath taken to him&s;elf &s;even &s;pirits more wicked than the fir&s;t, who enter in and dwell among us. Yea, let us look back to the churches in the apo&s;tles days, con&s;ider
<PB N="6" REF="015555_0005_0F99876423A11FD0">
their love, zeal and purity, and comparing our pre&s;ent &s;tate with theirs, let us remember how grievou&s;ly we have fallen, and repent and do the fir&s;t works. Then were fewer Hypocrites in the churches; profe&s;&s;ors had reli|gion at heart; Chri&s;t dwelt among them, and additions were made to them daily of &s;uch as &s;hould be &s;aved. Then how holy! How humble! How meek! How patient! How prayerful! How heavenly minded were chri&s;tians! But alas, even in John's time, many began to decline, as appears by our Lord's rebukes in the&s;e &s;even epi&s;tles. And though there have been &s;everal re|vivals in the church &s;ince, yet alas, how have we fallen from the premitive purity! How cold is our love to Chri&s;t and to &s;ouls! How dull our devotions! How languid our zeal! What pride, malice and hypocri&s;y prevail among us! While many have been careful to tithe mint, ani&s;e and cummin, we have omitted weighti|er matters. How is the gold become dim, and the mo&s;t fine gold is changed!</P>
<P>For the&s;e things, for our woeful and amazing &s;ecuri|ty, the &s;on of God the glorions Immanual is grieved, and hath of late in an awful degree withdrawn his holy &s;pi|rit from us, as appears&mdash;from the general decay of ho|ly zeal in mini&s;ters and churches&mdash;from the awful a|batement of &s;piritual life and power in the holy ordi|nances&mdash;and from the growing prevalency of all kinds of &s;in and iniquity, even under the tremendous frowns of Jehovah.</P>
<P>O let us remember Jeru&s;alem; what di&s;tre&s;s and de|&s;olation came upon them for grieving away the infinite|ly glorious Immanual! What &s;word! What &s;ickne&s;s! What famine raged among them, till they were almo&s;t extirpated from the earth!</P>
<P>And verily we have had &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;igns that preceeded their de&s;truction. They had calls, but de&s;|pi&s;ed them; &s;o have we. They were corrected, but hardened under the rod; &s;o are we. They bit and devour|ed one another, making the &s;heckel great and the ephah &s;mall; and in&s;tead of &s;elling that which was good, they
<PB N="7" REF="015555_0006_0F998764E28B46E8">
&s;old the refu&s;e of their wheat; their commodities were corrupt and adulterated;&mdash;added to the&s;e, they im|pri&s;oned God's Heralds.</P>
<P>They had al&s;o, as Jo&s;ephus relates, &s;igns in the hea|vens, &s;trange appearances, and particularly a "comet that hung over Jeru&s;alem, for a year together, in the form of a &s;word." And we, for more than fifty years pa&s;t, have been often warned by prodigies in the hea|vens, particularly that called the <HI>aurora borealis,</HI> or a light in the north, which has &s;ometimes appeared exceeding awful, like &s;treaks of blood and fire, &s;treaming from the hori|zon almo&s;t or quite to the zenith: And after what philo&s;ophers &s;ay concerning the natural cau&s;e, it &s;till remains a prodigy to all; and is commonly &s;aid to be the fore-runner of a &s;torm. We are &s;till hardened, nor can it be expected that any prodigies will reform us, while we hear not Mo&s;es and the prophets. And if our &s;ins bring on us di&s;tre&s;s &s;imilar to that on the Jews, then no marvel that we &s;ee the &s;ame &s;igns preceeding it.</P>
<P>But before the decree be gone forth; before the glo|ry of the Lord, to make his final departure, go up from the mid&s;t of us, let us repent and earne&s;tly be&s;eech Im|manual to return and dwell among us. Then &s;hould we &s;ee happy days again, as we have &s;een before.</P>
<P>III. Let us hear what the &s;pirit faith to the churches in this land, by way of threatning.</P>
<P>He, who is the Amen, the faithful and true witne&s;s, the beginning of the creation of God, who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine bra&s;s as if they did burn in a furnace, who&s;e voice is as the &s;ound of many waters, and out of who&s;e mouth proceedeth a &s;harp two edged &s;word; he &s;peaks to the church in this land, in accents louder than thunder; he &s;ays, repent, or I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candle&s;tick out of his place. That is, I will unchurch you, ye &s;hall have no mini&s;ters nor ordinances, and the places of wor&s;hip ye re&s;orted to, &s;hall enjoy their &s;ilent &s;abbaths; and this he threatens to do quickly.</P>
<P>Again he &s;ays, repent, or el&s;e I will come unto thee
<PB N="8" REF="015555_0007_0F99876643029970">
quickly, and will fight again&s;t them with the &s;word of my mouth; that is I will pronounce terrible woes a|gain&s;t thee, and will execute all the threatenings in my word upon thee, except thou repent.</P>
<P>Again he &s;ays, becau&s;e thou art luke warm, and art neither cold nor hot, I will &s;pew thee out of my mouth. Now remember the&s;e A&s;ian churches: They, and many others, have long &s;ince felt the frowns of the Lamb. But perhaps &s;ome will be ready to &s;ay, ah! Immanuel is bent on our ruin; he would de&s;troy us of choice. But no, judgment is his &s;trange work; he doth not af|flict willingly, nor grieve the children of men; he hath &s;worn by an oath, as I live faith the Lord God, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. And as he &s;aid to the church in Laodicea, he &s;ays to his corrupt church in this land. As many as I love I rebuke and cha&s;ten&punc; be zealous therefore and repeat.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding we have mo&s;t &s;hamefully left our fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; notwith&s;tanding the bla&s;phemy of &s;ome, the corruption of many, the luke warmne&s;s of mo&s;t, yet he, the glorious Immanuel, is now drawing near and waiting for our return.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, behold I &s;tand at the door and knock; If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will &s;up with him, and he with me. O how gentle! How w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing! How conde&s;cending! How a|mazing this! Verily he mu&s;t be deafer than a &s;tone, and his heart harder than adement, who is not moved with it. Again and for encouragement, he faith, to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the mid&s;t of the paradi&s;e of God. That is, they &s;hall partake of the full joy of heaven above; and as the tree of life is in Eden would have been to Adam a &s;acrament of confirmation, in ca&s;e he had &s;tood till the end of his trial, &s;o they, in the more glorious paradi&s;e above, &s;hall forever enjoy the &s;ure&s;t pledges of their confirmation in eternal bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor let any &s;ay, becau&s;e we are out of the church,
<PB N="9" REF="015555_0008_0F998766A099B400">
the &s;pirit faith nothing to us. Whether you are in the church or out of it, if you are ungodly there is a por|tion for you in the &s;acred word.</P>

<P>Church power is a &s;ubject on which a world of books have been wrote, and fear o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> blood have been already &s;pilt.&mdash;I would humbly offer a few remarks.</P>
<P>In the time of the Apo&s;tles a chri&s;tian church con&s;i&s;t|ed of the people, their leaders and deacons; and every church had authority to govern it&s;elf according to the word of God, and was &s;ubject, as a church, to the controul of no power under Chri&s;t. Hence St. Paul bids the church of Corinth to put away from among them&s;elves that wicked per&s;on. See 1 Cor. v. 13.</P>
<P>They had the power of excommunication in them|&s;elves; and it &s;eems that even the apo&s;tles did not pro|ceed in matters of importance without the con&s;ent of the brotherhood, as in Acts. xv. 22&mdash;3. Then plea&s;ed
<PB N="11" REF="015555_0010_0F9987C708D707F0">
it the Apo&s;tles and Elders, with the whole church, to &s;end cho&s;en men of their own company to Antioch. See al&s;o Acts i. 15 to the end&mdash;and Acts vi. 3. And while love like the &s;pirit in the living creatures animated the Apo&s;tles, Elders and Brethren, they each went &s;traight forward. Then they were &s;trong; nor did they appre|hend any need of leaning upon others.</P>
<P>But &s;ome time after their love and zeal were abated, all authority was re&s;igned to the eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and the Pope tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed with d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eadful &s;way; and now the Church groaned under bondage in Babylon for &s;everal ages. Thus, what the Lord Chri&s;t gave to his chur|ches, to u&s;e for their peace and edification, they tamely re&s;igned, and the Pope proudly a&s;&s;umed. But the re|formation led the Church partly out of this bondage: The Prote&s;tants have recovered this power out of the hands of the Pope. The Epi&s;copalians lodged it in the hands of Bi&s;hops: But the Pre&s;byterians went further; they retrieved the power out of the hands of the Pope and lodged it in the hands of the Clergy and a number of Elders cho&s;en out of the Brotherhood to a&s;&s;i&s;t in go|verning. In this &s;tage of the Reformation they did much better than in the former.</P>
<P>But after this, the Di&s;&s;enters in England retrieved the authority from the Bi&s;hops &s;olely, and acknowledged it to be in the hands of the church officers, and of every private brother, and that none under Chri&s;t &s;hould controul them.</P>
<P>Thus, after long antichri&s;tian tyranny, the power came home again to the church, and was lodged nearer where Chri&s;t left it than it had been for many ages be|fore. This Authority went out in the decrea&s;e of love, and in the increa&s;e of love it returned.</P>
<P>But, O New-England churches! you have gone backward and not forward; you have abated of your love, zeal and fervency in religion, and in&s;tead of lean|ing upon the Lord Chri&s;t, as once, calling no man fa|ther upon earth, you tru&s;t in an arm of fle&s;h. In&s;tead of going to God for light and &s;trength to judge and deter|mine
<PB N="12" REF="015555_0011_0F9987C789D739E0">
your own matters, we go to councils, and com|mit Chri&s;t, his cau&s;e, or his people into their hands. This privilege, the Church's power, is not to be &s;old as E&s;au &s;old his birthright.</P>
<P>Our pious forefathers contended warmly for it in Old England;&mdash;the Lord Chri&s;t gave it them, and &s;ent them over to this land that they might enjoy it without mole&s;tation; and now will you bury the talent which you once prayed &s;o earne&s;tly you might po&s;&s;e&s;s, will you bury it in the hands of councils, and then &s;ay to the Lord, Lo, there thou ha&s;t that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> thine?

<P>O New-England Churches, your crime in going back|ward, after &s;uch marvellous deliverances, is much greater than if you had never come thus far. I&s;rael were about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re|turn to Egypt; and you have really made progre&s;s in going back to what you once di&s;avowed and exclaimed again&s;t.

Then you will have le&s;s inclination to commit this &s;acred right to councils, and they will le&s;s de&s;ire it; and I believe that &s;uch a reformation is as laudable as it was for the Jews to return from Babylon to rebuild Jeru&s;alem. This would embolden you to look to God for that pro|tection in an approaching &s;torm which he afforded to our forefathers. Would you enjoy their ble&s;&s;ing, then prove your&s;elves their children by following them as they followed Chri&s;t and his primitive churches.</P>
