<P>'THE theatre is not yet opened, wherein &s;olid happine&s;s can be found by man.' God ne|ver de&s;igned we &s;hould enjoy compleat felicity in this &s;tate of di&s;cipline. Every &s;cene that opens upon us, in the pre&s;ent drama of human life, has in it an in|termixture of good and evil. The mo&s;t pro&s;perous and happy condition is attended with many unavoid|able &s;orrows and troubles. There is al&s;o a certain proportion of good to be found in the mo&s;t adver&s;e and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances. In pro&s;perity we find enough of evil to wean us from this world, and teach
<PB N="4" REF="014723_0004_0F9486AED048B768">
us to &s;eek for happine&s;s in that <HI>better country,</HI> which chri&s;tianity opens to our view. And in adver&s;ity we experience &s;o much of the unde&s;erved goodne&s;s of God, as affords abundant matter for thank&s;giving, and lays a foundation for hope and tru&s;t.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the perver&s;ene&s;s of our nature, that pro&s;perity is apt to make us forgetful of God and our future intere&s;ts; and adver&s;ity, to fill our minds with murmuring and de&s;pondency, and to turn off our at|tention from the many mercies that are intermixed with our troubles, and which demand our grateful acknowledgments.</P>
<P>In times of calamity, men are apt to confine their views too much to the dark &s;ide of things, and, look|ing through the gloomy mediums of doubt and di&s;|tru&s;t, to wrap their minds in clouds of ominous dark|ne&s;s, and fill them with anxious anticipations of fu|ture evils, which may never happen. From hence ari&s;e unworthy thoughts of God and his providential government, incon&s;i&s;tent with that grateful and re|&s;igned frame of mind, which it becomes us as rea|&s;onable creatures, and as chri&s;tians, to cultivate and pre&s;erve "through all the changing &s;cenes of life." Did we but frequently turn our eyes off from the dark, and fix them upon the fair and bright &s;ide of things, we &s;hould find our&s;elves &s;urrounded with &s;o many mercies, even in the mo&s;t unfavourable concurrence of events, as would, at the &s;ame time, &s;erve to mitigate our &s;orrows, to excite our gratitude to God, and en|courage a religious and cheerful dependance on his providence.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence are &s;ometimes overca&s;t with clouds and darkne&s;s, yet even at &s;uch times, we are not left wholly de&s;titute and for|lorn;
<PB N="5" REF="014723_0005_0F9486AF77A55898">
but have many experimental evidences of the paternal care of our heavenly father. Some rays of di|vine goodne&s;s &s;hine through the darke&s;t &s;cenes. And if, religiou&s;ly re&s;igned to the will of God, we behave well, in times of trouble, we have rea&s;on to hope, that in the i&s;&s;ue of things, good will come to us out of evil. For that God con&s;ults the good of his crea|tures, not only in the mercies he be&s;tows, but in the evils he brings upon them, during their &s;tate of pro|bation, is a truth, which no one can doubt of, who entertains ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the perfections of his nature. Ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s are the pillars of his throne; and his dominion is founded in infinite wi&s;dom, equity and benevolence.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides an attention to the many ble&s;&s;ings, that are mingled with the troubles and afflictions of this life, it would be well for us, in all times of adver&s;ity, di&s;tre&s;s and danger; and whenever the a&s;pects of providence are dark, and our minds are agitated with anxious &s;ollicitudes about the event of things; to turn our thoughts back upon pa&s;t favours, and reflect on the manifold mercies we have already received. This would tend to bani&s;h all murmuring, di&s;tru&s;t and ill-boding apprehen&s;ions from our minds; to awaken tho&s;e grateful &s;entiments for favours pa&s;t, that are re|qui&s;ite to prepare us for the reception of future need|ed mercies; and to di&s;po&s;e us to exerci&s;e &s;uch an humble and cheerful dependance on the goodne&s;s of God for all nece&s;&s;ary &s;uccour and relief, as would be a mighty &s;upport to our &s;pirits, under the mo&s;t griev|ous outward trials and calamities. This, as appears from the pa&s;&s;age at the head of this di&s;cour&s;e, was the method which the P&s;almi&s;t took, to rai&s;e him&s;elf from de&s;pondency, and encourage his hope in God, in a time of di&s;tre&s;s and affliction.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="014723_0006_0F9486B04054EE30">What the particular calamities were, that the p&s;alm|i&s;t here refers to, or whether they were of a publick or private nature, we cannot perhaps certainly deter|mine; but it is plain they were &s;uch as lay very hea|vy on his mind, and cau&s;ed him almo&s;t to doubt of the goodne&s;s of divine providence. "His complaints, as one ob&s;erves, &s;eem to be of per&s;onal grievances, but the encouragements relate to the public concerns of the church: If they were private troubles that he was groaning under, we are therefore taught that what God has wrought for his church in general, may be improved for the comfort of particular belie|vers: If it was &s;ome public calamity, that he is here lamenting, his &s;peaking of it &s;o feelingly, as if it was &s;ome particular trouble of his own, &s;hews us how much we &s;hould lay to heart the intere&s;ts of the church of God, and make them our own."</P>
<P>The P&s;almi&s;t under melancholy fears and pre&s;ages re&s;pecting the i&s;&s;ue of his troubles, and almo&s;t ready to renounce his hope in God, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the language of a di&s;con&s;olate, de&s;erted &s;oul, walking in darkne&s;s, with &s;carcely one reviving ray of light, to comfort and cheer it. <HI>Will the Lord ca&s;t off forever? And will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone forever? Doth his promi&s;e fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath be in anger &s;hut up his tender mercies?</HI> But as he is going on in this melancholy &s;train, he &s;uddenly checks him&s;elf, with that word, <HI>Selah.</HI> He pau&s;es, and, on a mo|ment's reflection, finds that his thoughts had taken a wrong turn. <HI>This is my infirmity,</HI> &s;ays he; that is, the&s;e di&s;tru&s;tful thoughts of providence; the&s;e gloomy fears and apprehen&s;ions, are owing to my weakne&s;s and wrong views of things. And in order to reco|ver him&s;elf from this &s;tate of dejection, and encou|rage his tru&s;t in God for deliverance, he calls to mind
<PB N="7" REF="014723_0007_0F9486B107ABBAD8">
his pa&s;t favours and loving-kindne&s;&s;es. <HI>I will remem|ber,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the years of the right hand of the Mo&s;t High. I will remember the works of the Lord; &s;urely I will remember thy wonders of old,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The text does therefore, naturally &s;ugge&s;t the fol|lowing ob&s;ervation, viz. That in times of trouble, dif|ficulty and danger, a grateful commemoration of for|mer in&s;tances of divine mercy and goodne&s;s, would be of excellent &s;ervice, to keep us from de&s;ponden|cy, and to encourage a cheerful hope in God, and de|pendance on his providence for all needed &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, my hearers, you all believe that the pro|vidence of God pre&s;ides over the world, and inter|po&s;es in all human affairs; that all &s;econd cau&s;es and &s;ubordinate agents are &s;ubject to his government; that no events happen contrary to, or be&s;ide his will, po|&s;itive or permi&s;&s;ive; that riches, and honour, and pro&s;perity, come from him; and that all adver&s;ities and calamities, whether public or private, are order|ed by him. Without &s;uch a faith as this, we cannot take a &s;ingle &s;tep towards a religious improvement, ei|ther of mercies or afflictions. Such a faith is nece&s;|&s;ary to lay a foundation for gratitude in pro&s;perity, and for re&s;ignation and tru&s;t in God in adver&s;ity. This faith is the &s;upport of good men, amid&s;t the con|fu&s;ions and di&s;orders, the wars, tumults and revolutions of this world, and in all times of hazard and danger. Such men, believing that all things are &s;ubject to the &s;uperintending providence of God, infinitely wi&s;e and infinitely gracious, cheerfully refer them&s;elves to his mercy, in confidence that he will &s;o di&s;po&s;e events, as &s;hall be for their intere&s;t and advantage, on the whole. Upon the wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s of God, they depend; and are ready to &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>God is our refuge and &s;trength, a very pre&s;ent

help in trouble: therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, and the mountains &s;hake with the &s;welling thereof.</HI></P>
<P>God is an immutable being. He is <HI>the &s;ame ye&s;ter|day, to-day, and forever; without any variablene&s;s, or &s;hadow of turning.</HI> Unchangeable in his nature and perfections, his power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s endure forever. And therefore, as in his pa&s;t dealings with us, he hath given a full demon&s;tration of his infinite benevolence, and the brighte&s;t evidences of his merci|ful di&s;po&s;ition towards us, it becomes us, while with gratitude we recollect the &s;ame, from thence to en|courage our&s;elves &s;till to hope and tru&s;t in him, what|ever difficulties and troubles, we may be involved in.</P>
<P>We &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals can &s;ee but little way in|to the va&s;t &s;cheme of divine providence. There are no certain principles upon which we can proceed in calculating the revolutions of the &s;ecret wheels there|of. We are unable to trace things into their various connections, or to look forward into all their remote and di&s;tant con&s;equences The mo&s;t perplexed and calamitous circum&s;tances, and gloomie&s;t appearances of things, are no &s;ure indications of God's having for|&s;aken us finally. In the hidden, and to us uncertain connection of events, the mo&s;t afflictive di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, may be be&s;t adapted to promote our well-being. As God treats us as beings in a &s;tate of trial and di&s;cipline, &s;o it cannot be rea&s;onably doubt|ed, but he will order all events re&s;pecting us, in &s;uch a manner, as his infinite wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;ee be&s;t calcu|lated to promote our happine&s;s, taking our pre&s;ent and future exi&s;tence into one connected view. In this view, the troubles and calamities, which we meet
<PB N="9" REF="014723_0009_0F9486B345C5B110">
with in this world, may be con&s;idered as di&s;ciplinary corrections, proceeding from the mercy of God, who hath a&s;&s;ured us, that, although for the pre&s;ent, they are not <HI>joyous</HI> but <HI>grievous,</HI> yet, if we improve them aright, they will finally <HI>work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</HI> Nor have tho&s;e things which are grievous to us, for the pre&s;ent, a be|neficial tendency in reference to our future &s;tate on|ly; but they may al&s;o be meant for our good even in this world, and be de&s;igned in providence to prepare the way for our greater pro&s;perity and outward feli|city. The good patriarch, Jacob, when he cried out, <HI>All the&s;e things are again&s;t me,</HI> little thought how wonderfully providence was working for the &s;alvati|on of him&s;elf and his family.</P>
<P>Whatever unfavourable conclu&s;ions, any per&s;ons, in the de&s;pondency and dejection of their &s;pirits, may draw from the publick troubles we are now involved in, the &s;upreme. Governor of all things may have in|tended them for the opening a way for the exaltati|on of the American colonies to the highe&s;t pitch of glory, honour, opulence, and renown. He, we know, is able to defeat the de&s;igns of a&s;piring ambition, and to over-rule the oppre&s;&s;ive and arbitrary &s;chemes that are now formed again&s;t America, for rendering her more honourable and important among the nations, than &s;he would otherwi&s;e be. The pre&s;ent uncon|&s;titutional and violent mini&s;terial politicks, for aught we know, may have been permitted by him, with a view to roll the ball of empire over to this We&s;tern world; and to make this land, (maugre the utmo&s;t efforts of powerful ambition and tyranny) the happy &s;eat of peace, liberty, learning, arts, virtue and religi|on; where, if any mi&s;erable people, in other quarters of the globe, after being &s;tript of the ble&s;&s;ings of free|dom, and having their necks galled, beyond human

patience, with the cruel yoke of bondage, &s;hould be driven in their extremity, to &s;eek a &s;afe retreat, they may find a &s;ecure a&s;ylum from &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, and quietly enjoy the fundamental rights of human nature. Should this be the effect of the vigorous ex|ertions of the noble patriots and &s;ons of freedom, who, at the ri&s;k of their lives and e&s;tates, are now engaged in the defence of their country, again&s;t the violent a&s;|&s;aults of arbitrary power, unborn millions will ri&s;e up and call them ble&s;&s;ed; and their memories will be dear to all po&s;terity, and will more de&s;ervedly receive the honours and prai&s;es of future generations, than the memories of many renowned heroes of antiqui|ty, who are ju&s;tly infamous in the view of every lover of human kind, for being celebrated chiefly for the &s;ucce&s;sful havock and deva&s;tation they committed among their fellow-creatures, and the mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s which they &s;pread through the world.</P>
<P>But whatever favourable or unfavourable conjec|tures any one may make, we know that the event of things is in the hands of God. We are unable to un|fold the volumes of futurity; and therefore we can|not with infallible certainty determine, what will be the i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent civil commotions and ho&s;tile conte&s;ts. However, let us, this day, in imitation of the P&s;almi&s;t, by a grateful recollection of pa&s;t favours, cheer and encourage our hearts, and endeavour to rai&s;e our confidence in Almighty God, the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;er of all events, who can ea&s;ily break in pieces that yoke of bondage, which is prepared for our necks. The wonderful interpo&s;itions of his providence in fa|vour of our worthy ance&s;tors, who, in order to re|move them&s;elves out of the reach of civil and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, and to enjoy unmole&s;ted the ble&s;&s;|ings of liberty, voluntarily exchanged the fair fields of Britain for the inho&s;pitable wilds of America, may

encourage us, their po&s;terity, in the pre&s;ent day of difficulty and danger, to put our tru&s;t in him, and to refer our cau&s;e to him, in hopes that he will pro&s;per our exertions for the defence of tho&s;e invaluable pri|vileges, that were &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider that the grand motive, which induced our forefathers to leave their native country, and to tran&s;plant them&s;elves into the uncultivated de|&s;arts of America, where they were &s;ure of meeting with the greate&s;t hard&s;hips and difficulties in acquir|ing a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, was a love of liberty, the ble&s;&s;ings whereof they were not permitted to en|joy on cheaper terms: When we con&s;ider al&s;o the many indubitable proofs, which the American colo|nies have given, from the beginning&punc; of their loyalty and firm allegiance to the Briti&s;h &s;overeigns, and their warm affection for the parent-&s;tate; and likewi&s;e that Great-Britain has been amply repaid for all the ex|pence &s;he has ever been at in protecting them, by re|gulating and re&s;tricting their commerce in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;ecure the principal advantages and pro|fits thereof to her&s;elf:&mdash;When we con&s;ider the&s;e things, how unju&s;t and cruel mu&s;t it appear in her, to attempt to deprive us of our dearly bought and un|forfeited liberty, and reduce us to &s;ervitude and bon|dage? Will &s;he never let us re&s;t in peace, until we come to that place where all <HI>the weary are at re&s;t</HI>? Is it not enough that &s;he drove out our progenitors by the iron rod of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, and forced them to flee for refuge into the howling wilderne&s;s of America? Will &s;he al&s;o pur&s;ue us, their po&s;terity, into the&s;e remote regions, to cha&s;ti&s;e us with the &s;ame iron rod, for no other fault than that of being a free peo|ple, and being re&s;olved to continue &s;o? One can hardly think of being thus pur&s;ued from Britain into the de&s;erts of America, without recollecting that pa&s;|&s;age

<P>Depoti&s;m has for &s;ome time been advancing with alarming &s;trides again&s;t American liberty.

<P>It al&s;o demands our grateful notice, that the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;er of all things, who has acce&s;s to all minds, and influences them as he plea&s;es, has in&s;pired the co|lonies with one heart and one &s;oul; and by inkindling within them that ardent love of liberty, which glow|ed in the brea&s;ts of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country, and which has all along been a di&s;tingui&s;hing charac|teri&s;tic of New-Englad, has di&s;po&s;ed them to unite as a band of brethren, for the defence of their common liberties and privileges, again&s;t the ho&s;tile inva&s;ions of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>It becomes us al&s;o, with thankful hearts, to ac|knowledge the goodne&s;s of God to us, in be&s;towing on us a great variety of private per&s;onal ble&s;&s;ings, a|mid&s;t the public calamities which have fallen upon us.

And although in addition to our other troubles, God has been plea|&s;ed this year to &s;end the pe&s;tilence into many of our towns, whereby we have been bereaved of many of our dear friends and relatives, and to vi&s;it us with a &s;evere drought, which prevailed for a while, threat|ning us with famine; yet through his good provi|dence the voice of health is again re&s;tored, and the earth has yielded her increa&s;e in &s;ufficient plenty for the comfortable &s;upply of all our wants.</P>

The inva&s;ion of the&s;e, in viola|tion of the &s;acred &s;ecurity of charters founded on royal faith, is the &s;ole ground of the pre&s;ent re&s;i&s;tance of America. The charges of di&s;loyalty and rebellious di&s;po&s;itions, that have been brought again&s;t us, have had no foundation, but in the calumnies of enemies. Though I will not vouch for the effects of the de&s;pa|ration into which the colonies are now driven, yet I will venture to affirm that their re&s;i&s;tance to the mea|&s;ures of admini&s;tration, did not originate from a de|&s;ire of independancy. They had it not even in con|templation to break their connection with Great-Bri|tain. On the contrary, it has been their warme&s;t wi&s;h, to live in friendly union with her, might they be per|mitted to do &s;o, without a re&s;ignation of their invalu|able rights.

<P>However bad we may be in a moral view, yet we are per&s;waded our cau&s;e is good.

No &s;ooner had Sir Edmond arri|ved in Bo&s;ton, and entered on his government, but, (as it is no unu&s;ual thing for the greate&s;t tyrants to do) he made high profe&s;&s;ions of regard for the publick good and the welfare of the people. But "<HI>Nero concealed his tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition more years, than Sir Edmond did months.

What would have been the effect of the people's ri&s;ing and taking arms on this occa&s;ion, had James accompli&s;h|ed his arbitrary de&s;igns in Great-Britain, we cannot tell. The vengeance of that haughty de&s;pot would, no doubt, have attempted &s;ome &s;evere puni&s;hment. But Heaven prevented. For providence ordering a Revolution <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The people of England, provoked at the arbitrary mea&s;ures of James the &s;econd, car|ried their oppo&s;ition to &s;uch an height, that he, through fear, left the kingdom; upon which, declaring the throne vacant, and excluding James and his family, they put the &s;ceptre into the hands of William, Prince of Orange, and changed the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And it may be ob&s;erved in ju&s;tification of America, that the principles upon which this memorable revolution was conducted and brought about, and the principles upon which &s;he re&s;i&s;ts and oppo&s;es the unlimited claims of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, are much the &s;ame. For as it matters not whether &s;lavery comes from the hands of one or of many, &s;o the &s;ame rea&s;on that will ju&s;tify a people in oppo&s;ing arbitrary power in a &s;ingle man, will e|qually hold to ju&s;tify them in oppo&s;ing the &s;ame kind of power in a number of men. No one, I believe, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an acute di&s;cernment, as to be able to perceive any ma|terial difference between being &s;ubject to unlimited de&s;poti&s;m in a &s;ingle per&s;on, under the title of ab&s;olute monarch, and being &s;ubject to the like de&s;potic power claimed by a far di&s;tant legi&s;lature, in which we are not repre&s;ented. A right in the Briti&s;h parliament to legi&s;late for us 'in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,' as a &s;en&s;ible writer ob&s;erves, "Would place us in the &s;ame &s;ituation the people of England would have been reduced to, had James the fir&s;t and his family &s;ucceeded in their &s;chemes of arbitrary power.

And when we con&s;ider, that on the principles of the revolution, which are evidently in favour of America, his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's right to the throne depends; is there not rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the movers and abettors of the pre&s;ent oppre&s;sive and violent mea&s;ures pro&s;ecuted again&s;t the colonies, (however free they are to charge us with di&s;loyalty) are them&s;elves Jacobites in heart; and have had it in view, fir&s;t to produce a rupture between Britain and America, and then to take the ad|vantage thereof, to introduce the Pretender, and advance the Stuart family to its ancient dignity!</P></NOTE> in England about the &s;ame time, the power of oppre&s;&s;ion was broken, and this people were happily delivered from the &s;ad effects of enraged ty|ranny, which they might otherwi&s;e have feared, and re&s;tored to the peaceable enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Though the people of this province had rea&s;on to rejoice with others, in the happy revelation, that was brought about in England, whereby they were delivered from the tyranny of the Stuart family, yet they never recovered their fir&s;t charter, which ought in equity to have been re&s;tored, &s;ince it was unju&s;tly wre&s;ted from them, in arbitrary times, when many other charters, which were afterwards re&s;tored, fell a &s;acrifice to lawle&s;s power and ambition. However, they obtained another charter, which, though it abridged &s;ome of their former privileges, was yet &s;o favourable to their liberties as Engli&s;hmen, that they cheerfully accepted the &s;ecurity it promi&s;ed them again&s;t all future encroachments on their rights.

<P>The other remarkable in&s;tance of God's merciful interpo&s;ition for the &s;alvation of New-England, which de&s;erves our grateful commemoration, is the defeat of the French fleet and army at Chebuctah, a|bout thirty years ago. This armament was the mo&s;t powerful that ever before was &s;ent to America. It con&s;i&s;ted, &s;ays a credible writer, of "twenty men of war, an hundred tran&s;ports, about eight thou&s;and di&s;|ciplined troops with veteran officers, and va&s;t quanti|ties of provi&s;ion, powder, &s;hot, arms, cannon, bombs and mortars, &s;ufficient to take the &s;tronge&s;t places; and all under one commander of figure, Duke D'An|ville, a nobleman of ability, &s;kill and courage." And New-England was then in a weak and defencele&s;s &s;tate, unable to with&s;tand &s;uch a mighty force. But the Lord God omnipotent interpo&s;ed, and marvellou&s;|ly defeated this formidable armada. He cau&s;ed <HI>the &s;tars in their cour&s;es to fight again&s;t them,</HI> as they did again&s;t Si&s;era of old. The winds and &s;eas were mu&s;|tered again&s;t them; the pe&s;tilence was commi&s;&s;ioned to invade their ho&s;t; innumerable blocks and un|fore&s;een cro&s;s accidents were thrown in their way; by all which, they were baffled, confounded, defeat|ed,
<PB N="22" REF="014723_0022_0F9486C0CE1D01B0">
and obliged to return a&s;hamed, with a wretched remnant, to their own country. Thus &s;alvation was wrought for us in a mo&s;t miraculous manner, with|out the in&s;trumentality of human means. This was the <HI>Lord's doing,</HI> and it ought always to be <HI>marvelous in our eyes.</HI> And this may teach us that the events of war, are not always agreable to human conjectures and probabilities, but at God's di&s;po&s;al, who can ea|&s;ily, by ways and means little thought of by men, di&s;concert the be&s;t concerted human &s;chemes, and cru&s;h into abortion the unrighteous enterprizes of his people's enemies.</P>
<P>Now, when we recollect the&s;e and &s;uch-like &s;ig|nal interpo&s;itions of divine providence in favour of New-England and America, what abundant rea&s;on have we to hope and tru&s;t in God, in the pre&s;ent dark and difficult day? However great the power or policy of our enemies may be, &s;till we have this to comfort us, that <HI>the Lord reigneth,</HI> who is able to con|found the deepe&s;t policies of men, to turn their wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;els into fooli&s;hne&s;s, to overthrow all their mi&s;|chievous devices, and entangle them in the &s;nares, which they have prepared for others. The wrath of man is under his controul; he &s;etteth bounds there|to, and &s;aith, <HI>thus far &s;halt thou come, but no further.</HI> Whatever men may de&s;ign, or attempt, <HI>the coun&s;el of the Lord, that &s;hall &s;tand.</HI> And from what he has done for his American heritage in times pa&s;t, we have rea&s;on to hope that he will never &s;uffer it to be given up to reproach and ruin, but will &s;till protect and defend it, and fru&s;trate all the evil de&s;igns of its enemies, if prevailing &s;in does not ob&s;truct the cour&s;e of his mercy.</P>

And while with pity they beheld tho&s;e &s;ervile timid &s;pirits, who, rather than engage in any noble exertion or tempt any ha|zard for the &s;ake of freedom, would I&s;&s;achar-like, ba&s;ely <HI>bow their &s;houlders to bear, and become &s;ervants unto tribute</HI>; with what &s;overeign contempt would they look down on tho&s;e venal &s;ordid few, who, in hopes of aggrandizing them&s;elves, and rioting in the &s;poils of injured and oppre&s;&s;ed innocence, have been inculcating the long exploded and trea&s;onable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the doctrine of unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and pa&s;&s;ive obedience to the POWERS IN BEING, be once admitted as ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, it will follow by inevitable con&s;equence, that the la&s;t revolution in England was a grand rebellion; and that all who had an hand in it, were rebels and traitors; and that all the Kings who have reigned &s;ince that time in Great-Britain, de&s;erve the title of u&s;urpors.</NOTE> doc|trine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, and aid|ing, to the utmo&s;t of their power, the uncon&s;tituti|onal mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration, for the en&s;laving, and ruining their native country? And with what ardor and earne&s;tne&s;s, would they warn us again&s;t &s;ubmitting to any yoke of bondage, and enjoin it up|on us to &s;tand fa&s;t in our liberties, and to per&s;evere in our laudible &s;truggles for the defence and pre&s;erva|tion of them!&mdash;Methinks I hear the&s;e brave and venerable per&s;onages, be&s;peaking us in the following &s;train; "We fled from our native land for the &s;ake
<PB N="25" REF="014723_0025_0F9486C6AEEC96A8">
of liberty, which we e&s;teemed the &s;overeign boon of Heaven, and deare&s;t of all outward enjoyments: For the &s;ake of this ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing, we cro&s;&s;ed the dangerous &s;eas, and took up our re&s;idence in this then uncultivated wilderne&s;s: For the &s;ake of this invalu|able enjoyment, we expended our trea&s;ure, endured all fatigues and hard&s;hips, and often jeoparded our lives in bloody wars with the &s;avage natives: We have &s;uffered every thing in the cau&s;e of freedom&mdash; for this we have fought&mdash;for this we have bled. You have entered into our labours, and without be|ing expo&s;ed to any great hard&s;hips and dangers, have enjoyed, till lately, the benign &s;miles of liberty, which co&s;t us &s;o much toil and blood. But now the day of trial is come. That infernal mon&s;ter, Slavery, from which we fled, not di&s;couraged by former un&s;ucce&s;s|ful attempts, has again in great wrath, cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to erect his throne on the&s;e we&s;tern &s;hores. Be not daunted at his hedi|ous form, nor affrighted at his menaces. Oppo&s;e him as a fiend of hell. Collect all your zeal and re|&s;olution into one united and vigorous effort, to expel him from hence. Quit your&s;elves like men; be brave; be courageous; be determined, would you be free. Liberty is the legacy, the rich legacy, which we have bequeathed to you, under a &s;acred entail, to be by you conveyed inviolate to your po&s;terity. Let it never be &s;aid of our &s;ons that they have ba&s;ely given up this legacy, and pu&s;illanimou&s;ly &s;ubmitted their necks to the iron yoke of bondage. Let it ne|ver be &s;aid of our &s;ons, that they con&s;ented to live in thraldom them&s;elves, and to leave a race of &s;laves be|hind them. Di&s;grace not your noble parentage; bring not everla&s;ting infamy upon your&s;elves, and perpetual mi&s;ery upon your de&s;cendants, by any &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions pernicious to liberty. Be not di&s;mayed at the appearance of dangers and difficulties, but with
<PB N="26" REF="014723_0026_0F9486C6CCEA36A0">
fortitude and heroi&s;m becoming the importance of the cau&s;e, continue your zealous endeavours, to &s;ave your&s;elves, your country and po&s;terity from impend|ing &s;ervitude. And for your encouragement, <HI>remem|ber the years of the right hand of the Mo&s;t High,</HI> and call to mind the many wonders which he has wrought in times pa&s;t, in favour of his church and people in this land; and con&s;ider that <HI>his arm is not &s;hortned that he cannot &s;ave,</HI> but that he is as able to help and deliver you, as he was your forefathers. Make him your friend and ally, and apply to him for aid, and doubt not, but he will interpo&s;e, to divert the evils that are levelled again&s;t you, to bani&s;h &s;ervitude far from you, and to &s;ucceed and pro&s;per your laudible conte&s;ts for the maintaining and &s;ecuring the ble&s;&s;|ings of freedom. May <HI>the Lord of Ho&s;ts be with you,</HI> and <HI>the God of Jacob be your refuge.</HI>"</P>
<P>In imitation of our pious progenitors, let us, while we are in the u&s;e of all natural and lawful means of defence and &s;afety, put our tru&s;t in God, the only hope and &s;aviour of his people in times of trouble. And while we refer our cau&s;e to him, let us take care to approve our&s;elves to him, by a con&s;cientious obe|dience to his holy will, as we de&s;ire that he &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e our cau&s;e, and &s;ecure to us tho&s;e outward li|berties and privileges, for which we are now earne&s;t|ly contending. Let us be thankful to him for &s;uch mercies as we have received and &s;till enjoy, and ex|pre&s;s our gratitude by a pious and holy conver&s;ation. Whatever ble&s;&s;ings he is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon us, let us improve to his honour, with &s;obriety and thank&s;giving. Let us beware of pride, and cautiou&s;|ly ab&s;lain from intemperance, prodigality and extra|vagance, vices, which, as they are contrary to the &s;pi|rit of religion, and highly provoking to Heaven, &s;o they al&s;o, in the natural cour&s;e of things, tend to
<PB N="27" REF="014723_0027_0F9486C7D0B6C348">
bring poverty and ruin upon a people; and which, we have rea&s;on to think, have had a great hand in pulling down the pre&s;ent calamities upon us. Let us, in our manner of living, confine our&s;elves to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of frugality and prudential oeconomy, as being highly ornamental to chri&s;tians; greatly con|ducive to the pro&s;perity of &s;ociety, at all times; and peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary at &s;uch a day as this. And to fru|gality and oeconomy let us add indu&s;try, and then, while we are ble&s;&s;ed with the common &s;miles of pro|vidence, we need not fear being &s;tarved into &s;lavery, in &s;uch a land of plenty as this. The &s;implicity of living which obtained among our forefathers in the early age of this country, much re&s;embling the &s;impli|city of the patriarchal ages, was much better adapted to promote temporal felicity, than the luxury, which, with the increa&s;e of wealth, has &s;ince taken place and prevailed. Nature is content with little. It is comparatively ea&s;y to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of nature; but to &s;atisfy pride is impo&s;&s;ible. Pride introduces luxury and expen&s;ive ways of living; and cu&s;tom gives &s;uch a currency to &s;uperfluities, that frugality can &s;carcely e&s;cape the odious epithets of meanne&s;s and avarice. But by whatever hard names it may be called, frugality is a virtue of high importance to a people's pro&s;perity; and therefore, as we wi&s;h well to our country, in the pre&s;ent trouble&s;ome times, it behoves us to retrench our extravagancies and &s;uper|fluous expences; to drop foreign luxuries; and con|fine our&s;elves, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to our own ma|nufactures, and the productions of our own land. This is what providence is now inculcating upon us, by the ob&s;tructions thrown in the way of foreign commerce. And happy &s;hall we be, and abundant rea&s;on &s;hall we have to give thanks to God, if we can enjoy our liberty, though we &s;hould be depri|ved of tho&s;e foreign &s;uperfluities, which have been
<PB N="28" REF="014723_0028_0F9486C862A22660">
generally too &s;hamefully abu&s;ed as occa&s;ions of pride and vanity.</P>
<P>But let us, my hearers, more e&s;pecially take care to make a wi&s;e improvement of our religious advan|tages and privileges, which, through the goodne&s;s of God, have been hitherto pre&s;erved to us entire. Let us live up to our obligations as chri&s;tians, and by a diligent improvement of the means of grace, endea|vour to make &s;ea&s;onable preparation for a ble&s;&s;ed im|mortality in the world to come. This world, at be&s;t, is a <HI>vale of tears.</HI> Many are the unavoidable &s;orrows and infelicities, that flow from the frailties of our frame, and the precarious un&s;table nature of all earth|ly enjoyments; much greater and more numerous are the troubles, vexations and woes, that flow from the ungoverned lu&s;ts of men, which are an unhappy &s;ource of perpetual di&s;cord, variance, &s;trife, rapine, violence and war. But we are a&s;&s;ured that there is a better world, prepared beyond the grave, for all good men, where they &s;hall be exempt from all evil, and enjoy compleat and endle&s;s felicity. Thither let us &s;oar in our affections; thither let us bend our cour&s;e; and to prepare therefor let us make the main bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives. If we will do thus, the pro&s;|pect of future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and glory, which, with in|crea&s;ing brightne&s;s will open to our view, will great|ly alleviate and a&s;&s;uage the &s;orrows of this life, and af|ford us con&s;olation amid&s;t all the afflictions and tri|bulations of this trouble&s;ome tran&s;itory world.</P>
<P>Religion, my friends, the religion of Je&s;us imbib|ed into the heart, and reduced to practice, is the chan|nel through which the greate&s;t comforts that can be enjoyed on earth, are conveyed unto men. This will give us hope in God, and quiet repo&s;e under the wings of his mercy, in times of the greate&s;t trouble
<PB N="29" REF="014723_0029_0F9486C9046AA550">
and danger. This will give us liberty of a far more noble and happifying nature, than that outward civil liberty for which we are contending, this day. This will free us from the tyrannical dominion of our lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, and advance us to the <HI>glorious li|berty of the children of God,</HI> wherein the perfection and happine&s;s of human nature con&s;i&s;t, and without which, we &s;hall be &s;laves, how much &s;oever we may hate the name. This, in fine, will afford us great joys, in the views of divine favour, here; and pre|pare the way for our admi&s;&s;ion to <HI>joys un&s;peakable and full of glory,</HI> to joys uninterrupted, everla&s;ting, and adequate to our capacities, in the beatific pre&s;ence of God, hereafter. AMEN.</P>
