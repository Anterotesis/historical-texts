<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<P>ON the north-ea&s;t coa&s;t of Scotland, in the mo&s;t romantic part of the Highlands, &s;tood the ca&s;tle of Athlin; an edifice built on the &s;ummit of a rock who&s;e ba&s;e was in the &s;ea. This pile was venera|ble from its antiquity, and from its gothic &s;tructure; but more venerable from the virtues which it enclo&s;ed. It was the re&s;i|dence of the &s;till beautiful widow, and the children, of the noble Earl of Athlin, who was &s;lain by the hand of Malcolm, a neighbouring chief, proud, oppre&s;&s;ive, re|vengeful; and &s;till re&s;iding in all the pomp of feudal greatne&s;s, within a few miles of the ca&s;tle of Athlin.

domain of Athlin, was the occa&s;ion of the animo&s;ity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the chiefs. Frequent broils had happened be|tween their clans, in which that of Athlin had generally been victorious. Malcolm, who&s;e pride was touched by the defeat of his people; who&s;e ambition was curbed by the authority, and who&s;e greatne&s;s was rivalled by the power of the Earl, conceiv|ed for him that deadly hatred which oppo|&s;ition to its favourite pa&s;&s;ions naturally ex|cites in a mind like his, haughty and un|accu&s;tomed to controul; and he meditated his de&s;truction. He planned his purpo&s;e with all that addre&s;s which &s;o eminently marked his character, and in a battle which was attended by the chiefs of each party in per&s;on, he contrived, by a curi|ous fine&s;&s;e, to entrap the Earl, accompa|nied by a &s;mall detachment, in his wiles, and there &s;lew him. A general rout of his clan en&s;ued, which was followed by a dreadful &s;laughter; and a few only e&s;caped to tell the horrid cata&s;trophe to Matilda.

Matilda, overwhelmed by the news, and deprived of tho&s;e numbers which would make revenge &s;ucce&s;sful, forbore to &s;acri|fice the lives of her few remaining people to a feeble attempt at retaliation, and &s;he was con&s;trained to endure in &s;ilence her &s;orrows and her injuries.</P>
<P>Incon&s;olable for his death, Matilda had withdrawn from the public eye, into this ancient &s;eat of feudal government, and there, in the bo&s;om of her people and her family, had devoted her&s;elf to the educa|tion of her children. One &s;on and one daughter were all that &s;urvived to her care and their growing virtues promi&s;ed to re|pay all her tenderne&s;s. O&s;bert was in his nineteenth year: nature had given him a mind ardent and &s;u&s;ceptible, to which e|ducation had added refinement and expan|&s;ion. The vi&s;ions of genius were bright in his imagination, and his heart, unchill|ed by the touch of di&s;appointment, glow|ed with all the warmth of benevolence.</P>

When fir&s;t we enter on the theatre of the world, and begin to notice its features, young imagination heightens every &s;cene, and the warm heart expands to all around it. The happy benevolence of our feel|ings prompts us to believe that every body is good, and excites our wonder why eve|ry body is not happy. We are fired with indignation at the recital of an act of inju&s;|tice, and at the unfeeling vices of which we are told. At a tale of di&s;tre&s;s our tears &s;low a full tribute to pity: at a deed of virtue our heart unfolds, our &s;oul a&s;pires, we ble&s;s the action, and feel our&s;elves the doer. As we advance in life, imagination is compelled to relinqui&s;h a part of her &s;weet delirium; we are led reluctantly to truth through the paths of experience; and the objects of our fond attention are viewed with a &s;everer eye. Here an alter|ed &s;cene appears;&mdash;frowns where late were &s;miles; deep &s;hades where late was &s;un|&s;hine: mean pa&s;&s;ions, or di&s;gu&s;ting apa|thy &s;tain the features of the principle fi|gures. We turn indignant from a pro&s;|pect

&s;o mi&s;erable, and court again the &s;weet illu&s;ions of our early days; but ah! they are fled for ever! Con&s;trained, there|fore, to behold objects in their more genu|ine hues, their deformity is by degrees le&s;s painful to us. The fine touch of moral &s;u&s;ceptibility, by frequent irritation, be|comes callous, and too frequently we min|gle with the world, till we are added to the number of its votaries.</P>
<P>Mary, who was ju&s;t &s;eventeen, had the accompli&s;hments of riper years, with the touching &s;implicity of youth. The graces of her per&s;on were inferior only to tho&s;e of her mind, which illumined her counte|nance with inimitable expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Twelve years had now elap&s;ed &s;ince the death of the Earl, and time had blunted the keen edge of &s;orrow. Matilda's grief had declined into a gentle and not unplea&s;|ing melancholy, which gave a &s;oft and in|tere&s;ting &s;hade to the natural dignity of her character. Hitherto her attention had been &s;olely directed towards rearing tho&s;e virtues which nature had planted with &s;o

liberal a hand in her children, and which, under the genial influence of her eye, had flouri&s;hed and expanded into beauty and &s;trength. A new hope, and new &s;olici|tudes, now aro&s;e in her brea&s;t: the&s;e dear children were arrived at an age, dangerous from its tender &s;u&s;ceptibility, and from the influence which imagination has at that time over the pa&s;&s;ions. Impre&s;&s;ions would &s;oon be formed which would &s;tamp their de&s;tiny for life. The anxious mother lived but in her children, and &s;he had yet ano|ther cau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>When O&s;bert learned the &s;tory of his father's death, his young heart glowed to avenge the deed. The late Earl, who had governed with the real dignity of power, was adored by his clan; they were eager to revenge his injuries; but oppre&s;&s;ed by the generous compa&s;&s;ion of the Counte&s;s, their murmurs &s;unk into &s;ilence: yet they fondly cheri&s;hed the hope that their young Lord would one day lead them on to con|que&s;t and revenge. The time was now come when they looked to &s;ee this hope,

the &s;olace of many a cruel moment, rea|lized. The tender fears of a mother would not &s;uffer Matilda to ri&s;que the chief of her la&s;t remaining comforts. She forbade O&s;bert to engage. He &s;ubmitted in &s;ilence, and endeavoured, by application to his fa|vourite &s;tudies, to &s;tifle the emotions which rou&s;ed him to arms. He excelled in the various accompli&s;hments of his rank, but chiefly in the martial exerci&s;es, for they were congenial to the nobility of his &s;oul, and he had a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in believing, that they would one time a&s;&s;i&s;t him to do ju&s;tice to the memory of his dead father. His warm imagination directed him to poetry, and he followed where &s;he led. He loved to wander among the romantic &s;cenes of the Highlands, where the wild variety of nature in&s;pired him with all the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of his favourite art. He delighted in the terible and in the grand, more than in the &s;ofter land&s;cape; and, wrapt in the bright vi&s;ions of fancy, would often lo&s;e him&s;elf in awful &s;olitudes.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031067_0009_0FEA9B0871DCD4E0">
It was in one of the&s;e rambles, that hav|ing &s;trayed for &s;ome miles over hills cover|ed with heath, from whence the eye was pre&s;ented with only the bold outlines of uncultivated nature, rocks piled on rocks, cataracts and va&s;t moors unmarked by the traveller's foot, he lo&s;t the path which he had him&s;elf made; he looked in vain for the objects which had directed him, and his heart, for the fir&s;t time, felt the repul&s;e of fear. No ve&s;tige of a human being was to be &s;een, and the dreadful &s;ilence of the place was interrupted only by the roar of di&s;tant torrents, and by the &s;creams of the birds which flew over his head. He &s;houted, and his voice was an&s;wered only by the deep echoes of the mountains. He remained for &s;ome time in a &s;ilent dread not wholly unplea&s;ing, but which was &s;oon heightened to a degree of terror not to be endured; and he turned his &s;teps backward, forlorn, and dejected. His memory gave him back no image of the pa&s;t; having wandered &s;ome time, he came to a narrow pa&s;s, which he entered, overcome with fatigue and
<PB N="11" REF="031067_0010_0FEA9B0DB3900708">
fruitle&s;s &s;earch: he had not advanced far, when an abrupt opening in the rock &s;ud|denly pre&s;ented him with a view of the mo&s;t beautifully romantic &s;pot he had ever &s;een. It was a valley almo&s;t &s;urrounded by a barrier of wild rocks, who&s;e ba&s;e was &s;haded with thick woods of pine and &s;ir. A torrent, which tumbled from the heights, and was &s;een between the woods, ru&s;hed with amazing impetuo&s;ity into a fine lake which &s;lowed through the vale, and was lo&s;t in the deep rece&s;&s;es of the mountains. Herds of cattle grazed in the bottom, and the delighted eyes of O&s;bert were once more ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ight of human dwel|lings. Far on the margin of the &s;tream were &s;cattered a few neat cottages. His heart was &s;o gladdened at the pro&s;pect, that he forgot he had yet the way to find which led to this Ely&s;ian vale. He was ju&s;t awakened to this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing reality, when his attention was once more engaged by the manly figure of a young highland pea|&s;ant, who advanced towards him with an air of benevolence, and, having learned
<PB N="12" REF="031067_0011_0FEA9B1162B9A600">
his di&s;tre&s;s, offered to conduct him to his cottage. O&s;bert accepted the invitation, and they wound down the hill, through an ob&s;cure and intricate path, together. They arrived at one of the cottages which the Earl had ob&s;erved from the height; they enter|ed, and the pea&s;ant pre&s;ented his gue&s;t to a venerable old Highlander, his fa|ther. Refre&s;hments were &s;pread on the table by a pretty young girl, and O&s;bert, after having partook of them and re&s;ted awhile, departed, accompanied by Alleyn, the young pea&s;ant, who had offered to be his guide. The length of the walk was beguiled by conver&s;ation. O&s;bert was intere&s;ted by di&s;covering in his companion a dignity of thought, and a cour&s;e of &s;en|timent &s;imilar to his own. On their way, they pa&s;&s;ed at &s;ome di&s;tance the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne. This object gave to O&s;bert a bitter reflection, and drew from him a deep &s;igh. Alleyn made ob&s;ervations on the bad policy of oppre&s;&s;ion in a chief, and produced as an in&s;tance the Baron Mal|colm. The&s;e lands, &s;aid he, are his, and
<PB N="13" REF="031067_0012_0FEA9B14FADFD6A0">
they are &s;carcely &s;ufficient to &s;upport his wretched people, who, &s;inking under &s;evere exactions, &s;uffer to lie uncultivated, tracts which would otherwi&s;e yield riches to their Lord. His clan, oppre&s;&s;ed by their burdens, threaten to ri&s;e and do ju&s;tice to them&s;elves by force of arms. The Baron, in haughty confidence, laughs at their defiance, and is in&s;en&s;ible to his danger; for &s;hould an in&s;urrection happen, there are other clans who would eagerly join in his de&s;truction, and puni&s;h with the &s;ame weapon the tyrant and the murderer. Sur|pri&s;ed at the bold independence of the&s;e words, delivered with uncommon energy, the heart of O&s;bert beat quick, and "O God! my father!" bur&s;t from his lips. Alleyn &s;tood agha&s;t! uncertain of the ef|fect which his &s;peech had produced; in an in&s;tant the whole truth fla&s;hed upon his mind: He beheld the &s;on of the Lord whom he had been taught to love, and who&s;e &s;ad &s;tory had been impre&s;&s;ed upon his heart in the early days of childhood;
<PB N="14" REF="031067_0013_0FEA9B16957A3310">
he &s;unk at his feet, and embraced his knees with a romantic ardor. The young Earl rai&s;ed him from the ground, and the fol|lowing words relieved him from his a&s;to|ni&s;hment, and filled his eyes with tears of mingled joy and &s;orrow: "There are other clans as ready as your own to avenge the wrongs of the noble Earl of Athlin; the Fitz-Henrys were ever friends to vir|tue." The countenance of the youth, while he &s;poke, was over&s;pread with the glow of con&s;cious dignity, and his eyes were animated with the pride of vir|tue. The brea&s;t of O&s;bert kindled with the noble purpo&s;e, but the image of his weeping mother cro&s;&s;ed his mind, and checked the ardor of the impul&s;e. "A time may come my friend," &s;aid he, "when your generous zeal will be accepted with the warmth of gratitude it de&s;erves. Par|ticular circum&s;tances will not &s;uffer me, at pre&s;ent, to &s;ay more." The warm at|tachment of Alleyn to his father &s;unk deep in his heart.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE following day was appointed for the celebration of an annual fe&s;tival given by the Earl to his people, and he would not &s;uffer Alleyn to depart. The hall was &s;pread with tables; and dance and merri|ment re&s;ounded through the ca&s;tle. It was u&s;ual on that day for the clan to a&s;&s;em|ble in arms, on account of an attempt, the memory of which it was meant to perpetu|ate, made, two centuries before, by an ho&s;tile clan to &s;urpri&s;e them in their fe&s;tivi|ty.</P>
<P>In the morning were performed the mar|tial exerci&s;es, in which emulation was ex|cited by the honorary rewards be&s;towed on excellence. The Counte&s;s and her love|ly daughter, beheld, from the ramparts of the ca&s;tle, the feats performed on the plains below. Their attention was engaged, and their curio&s;ity excited by the appearance of
<PB N="17" REF="031067_0016_0FEA9B23626F9510">
a &s;tranger, who managed the lance and the bow with &s;uch exqui&s;ite dexterity, as to bear off each prize of chivalry. It was Alleyn. He received the palm of victory, as was u&s;ual, from the hands of the Earl; and the mode&s;t dignity with which he ac|cepted it, charmed the beholders.</P>
<P>The Earl honoured the fea&s;t with his pre|&s;ence, at the conclu&s;ion of which, each gue&s;t aro&s;e, and &s;eizing his goblet with his left hand, and with his right &s;triking his &s;word, drank to the memory of their de|parted Lord. The hall echoed with the general voice. O&s;bert felt it &s;trike upon his heart the alarum of war. The people then joined hands, and drank to the honour of the &s;on of their late ma&s;ter. O&s;bert un|der&s;tood the &s;ignal, and overcome with emotion, every con&s;ideration yielded to that of avenging his father. He aro&s;e, and harrangued the clan with all the fire of youth and of indignant virtue. As he &s;poke, the countenance of his people fla&s;h|ed with impatient joy; a deep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of
<PB N="18" REF="031067_0017_0FEA9B250FD01498">
applau&s;e ran through the a&s;&s;embly; and when he was &s;ilent, each man, cro&s;&s;ing his &s;word with that of his neighbour, &s;wore by that &s;acred pledge of union, never to quit the cau&s;e in which they now engaged, till the life of their enemy had paid the debt of ju&s;tice and of revenge.</P>
<P>In the evening, the wives and daughters of the pea&s;antry came to the ca&s;tle, and joined in the fe&s;tivity. It was u&s;ual for the Counte&s;s and her ladies to ob&s;erve from a gallery of the hall, the various perform|ances of dance and &s;ong; and it had been a cu&s;tom of old for the daughter of the ca&s;tle to grace the occa&s;ion by performing a Scotch dance with the victor of the morn|ing. This victor now was Alleyn, who be|held the lovely Mary led by the Earl into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all, and pre&s;ented to him as his part|ner in the dance. She received his homage with a &s;weet grace. She was dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of a Highland la&s;s, and her fine au|burn tre&s;&s;es, which waved in her neck, were ornamented only with a wreath of ro|&s;es.
<PB N="19" REF="031067_0018_0FEA9B27189D6C10">
She moved in the dance with the light &s;teps of the Graces. Profound &s;ilence reigned through the hall during the per|formance, and a &s;oft murmur of applau&s;e aro&s;e on its conclu&s;ion. The admiration of the &s;pectators was divided between Ma|ry and the victorious &s;tranger. She retir|ed to the gallery, and the night concluded in joy to all but the Earl, and to Alleyn; but very different was the &s;ource and the complexion of their inquietude. The mind of O&s;bert revolved the chief occurrences of the day, and his &s;oul burned with impati|ence to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es of filial pi|ety; yet he dreaded the effect which the communication of his de&s;igns might have on the tender heart of Matilda: on the morrow, however, he re&s;olved to acquaint her with them, and in a few days to ri&s;e and pro&s;ecute his cau&s;e with arms.</P>
<P>Alleyn, who&s;e bo&s;om, till now, had felt only for others' pains, began to be con|&s;cious of his own. His mind, unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s, gave him only the image of the
<PB N="20" REF="031067_0019_0FEA9B2CEC9EC290">
high-born Mary; he endeavoured to ex|clude her idea, but with an effort &s;o faint, that it would &s;till intrude! Plea&s;ed, yet &s;ad, he would not acknowledge, even to him|&s;elf, that he loved; &s;o ingenious are we to conceal every appearance of evil from our&s;elves. He aro&s;e with the dawn, and departed from the ca&s;tle full of gratitude and &s;ecret love, to prepare his friends for the aproaching war.</P>
<P>The Earl awoke from broken &s;lumbers, and &s;ummoned all his fortitude to encoun|ter the tender oppo&s;ition of his mother. He entered her apartment with faultering &s;teps, and his countenance betrayed the emotions of his &s;oul. Matilda was &s;oon in|formed of what her heart had foreboded, and overcome with dreadful &s;en&s;ation, &s;unk lifele&s;s in her chair. O&s;bert flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Mary and the attendants &s;oon recovered her to &s;en&s;e and wretched|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The mind of O&s;bert was torn by the mo&s;t cruel conflict: filial duty, honour,
<PB N="21" REF="031067_0020_0FEA9B338D2F80E8">
revenge, commanded him to go; filial love, regret, and pity, entreated him to &s;tay. Mary fell at his feet, and cla&s;ping his knees with all the wild energy of grief, be&s;ought him to relinqui&s;h his fatal pur|po&s;e, and &s;ave his la&s;t &s;urviving parent&punc; her tears, her &s;ighs, and the &s;oft &s;implicity of her air, &s;poke a yet &s;tronger language than her tongue: but the &s;ilent grief of the Counte&s;s was &s;till more touching, and in his endeavours to &s;ooth her, he was on the point of yielding his re&s;olution, when the figure of his dying father aro&s;e to his imagination, and &s;tamped his purpo&s;e ir|revocably. The anxiety of a fond mother, pre&s;ented Matilda with the image of her &s;on bleeding and gha&s;tly; the death of her Lord was revived in her memory with all the agonizing grief that &s;ad event had im|pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart, the har&s;her cha|racters of which the lenient hand of time had almo&s;t obliterated. So lovely is pity in all her attitudes, that fondne&s;s prompts us to believe &s;he can never tran&s;gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he changes into a vice, when &s;he over|comes
<PB N="22" REF="031067_0021_0FEA9B3640CB6268">
the purpo&s;es of &s;tronger virtue. Ster|ner principles now nerved the brea&s;t of O&s;bert again&s;t her influence, and impelled him on to deeds of arms. He &s;ummoned a few of the mo&s;t able and tru&s;ty of the clan, and held a council of war; in which it was re&s;olved that Malcolm &s;hould be attacked with all the force they could a&s;&s;emble, and with all the &s;peed which the importance of the preparation would allow. To prevent &s;u&s;picion and alarm to the Baron, it was agreed it &s;hould be given out, that the&s;e pre|parations were intended for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Chief of a di&s;tant part. That, when they &s;et out on the expedition, they &s;hould pur&s;ue, for &s;ome time, a contrary way, but under favour of the night &s;hould &s;ud|denly change their route, and turn upon the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alleyn was &s;trenuous in exciting his friends to the cau&s;e, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the undertaking, as to have collected, in a few days, a number of no incon&s;iderable con&s;equence. To the warm
<PB N="23" REF="031067_0022_0FEA9B37EF2EC028">
enthu&s;ia&s;m of virtue was now added a new motive of exertion. It was no longer &s;im|ply an attachment to the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, which rou&s;ed him to action; the pride of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf in the eyes of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and of de&s;erving her e&s;teem by his zealous &s;ervices, gave combined force to the fir&s;t impul&s;e of benevolence. The &s;weet thought of de&s;erving her thanks, operated &s;ecretly on his &s;oul, for he was yet ignorant of its influence there. In this &s;tate he again appeared at the ca&s;tle, and told the Earl, that him&s;elf and his friends were ready to follow him whenever the &s;ignal &s;hould be given. His offer was ac|cepted with the warmth of kindne&s;s it claimed, and he was de&s;ired to hold him|&s;elf in readine&s;s for the on&s;et.</P>

It was evening when the Earl departed from the ca&s;tle; he pur&s;ued a contrary route till night favoured his de&s;igns, when he wheeled towards the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne. The extreme darkne&s;s of the night a&s;&s;i&s;ted their plan, which was to &s;cale the walls, &s;urprize the centinels; bur&s;t their way into the inner courts &s;word in hand, and force the murderer from his retreat. They had trod for many miles the dreary wilds, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the lea&s;t gleam of light, when &s;uddenly their ears were &s;truck with the di&s;mal note of a watch-bell, which chimed the hour of the night. Every heart beat to the &s;ound. They knew they were near the abode of the Baron. They halted to con|&s;ult concerning their proceedings, when it was agreed, that the Earl, with Alleyn and a cho&s;en few, &s;hould proceed to reconnoi|tre the ca&s;tle, while the re&s;t &s;hould remain at a &s;mall di&s;tance awaiting the &s;ignal of ap|proach. The Earl and his party pur&s;ued their march with &s;ilent &s;teps; they perceiv|ed a faint light, which they gue&s;&s;ed to pro|ceed
<PB N="26" REF="031067_0025_0FEA9B4753DA0BE8">
from the watch-tower of the ca&s;tle, and they were now almo&s;t under its walls. They pau&s;ed awhile in &s;ilence to give breath to expectation, and to li&s;ten if any thing was &s;tirring. All was involved in the gloom of night, and the &s;ilence of death prevailed. They had now time to examine, as well as the darkne&s;s would permit, the &s;ituation of the ca&s;tle, and the height of the walls; and to prepare for the a&s;&s;ault. The edifice was built with gothic magnifi|cence upon a high and dangerous rock. Its lofty towers &s;till frowned in proud &s;ub|limity, and the immen&s;ity of the pile &s;tood a record of the ancient con&s;equence of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. The rock was &s;urrounded by a ditch, broad, but not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ep, over which were two draw-bridges, one on the north &s;ide, the other on the ea&s;t; they were both up, but as they &s;eparated in the cen|ter, one half of the bridge remained on the &s;ide of the plains. The bridge on the north led to the grand gateway of the ca&s;|tle; that on the ea&s;t to a &s;mall watch-tow|er: the&s;e were all the entrances. The rock
<PB N="27" REF="031067_0026_0FEA9B49277205C0">
was almo&s;t perpendicular with the walls, which were &s;trong and lofty. After &s;ur|veying the &s;ituation, they pitched upon a &s;pot where the rock appeared mo&s;t acce&s;&s;i|ble, and which was contiguous to the prin|cipal gate, and gave &s;ignal to the clan. They approached in &s;ilence, and gently throwing down the bundles of faggots, which they had brought for the purpo&s;e, into the ditch, made them&s;elves a bridge over which they pa&s;&s;ed in &s;afety, and pre|pared to a&s;cend the heights. It had been re&s;olved that a party, of which Alleyn was one, &s;hould &s;cale the walls, &s;urprize the cen|tinels, and open the gates to the re&s;t of the clan, which, with the Earl, were to re|main without. Alleyn was the fir&s;t who fixed his ladder and mounted; he was in|&s;tantly followed by the re&s;t of his party, and with much difficulty, and &s;ome ha|zard, they gained the ramparts in &s;afety. They traver&s;ed a part of the platform with|out hearing the &s;ound of a voice or a &s;tep; profound &s;leep &s;eemed to bury all. A num|ber
<PB N="28" REF="031067_0027_0FEA9B4E0783DBD0">
of the party approached &s;ome centinels who were a&s;leep on their po&s;t; them they &s;eized; while Alleyn, with a few others, flew to open the neare&s;t gate, and to let down the drawbridge. This they accom|pli&s;hed; but in the mean time the &s;ignal of &s;urpri&s;e was given, and in&s;tantly the a|larm bell rang out, and the ca&s;tle re&s;ound|ed with the clang of arms. All was tumult and confu&s;ion. The Earl, with part of his people, entered the gate; the re&s;t were following, when &s;uddenly the portcullis was dropped, the bridge drawn up, and the Earl and his people found them&s;elves &s;urrounded by an armed multitude, which poured in torrents from every rece&s;s of the ca&s;tle. Surpri&s;ed, but not daunted, the Earl ru&s;hed forward &s;word in hand, and fought with a de&s;perate valour. The &s;oul of Alleyn &s;eemed to acquire new vigour from the conflict; he fought like a man panting for honour, and certain of victory; wherever he ru&s;hed, conque&s;t flew before him. He, with the Earl, forced his way into the inner courts, in &s;earch of the Ba|ron,
<PB N="29" REF="031067_0028_0FEA9BCC58EA99E0">
and hoped to have &s;atisfied a ju&s;t re|venge, and to have concluded the conflict with the death of the murderer; but the moment in which they entered the courts, the gates were clo&s;ed upon them; they were environed by a band of guards; and, after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance, in which Alleyn, received a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ight wound, they were &s;eized as pri&s;oners of war. The &s;laughter without was great and dreadful: the people of the Baron in&s;pired with fury, were in&s;atiate for death; many of the Earl's followers were killed in the courts and on the plat|form; many, in attempting to e&s;cape, were thrown from the ramparts, and many were de&s;troyed by the &s;udden rai&s;ing of the bridge. A &s;mall part, only, of the brave and adventurous band who had engaged in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, and who were driven back from the walls, &s;urvived to carry the dreadful tidings to the Counte&s;s. The fate of the Earl remained unknown. The con&s;ternation among the friends of the &s;lain is not to be de&s;cribed, and it was
<PB N="30" REF="031067_0029_0FEA9B54A93AB000">
heightened by the unaccountable manner in which the victory had been obtained; for it was well known that Malcolm had never, but when war made it nece&s;&s;ary, more &s;oldiers in his garri&s;on than feudal pomp demanded; yet on this occa&s;ion, a number of armed men ru&s;hed from the re|ce&s;&s;es of his ca&s;tle, &s;ufficient to overpower the force of a whole clan. But they knew not the &s;ecret means of intelligence which the Baron po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; the jealou&s;y of con&s;ci|ence had armed him with apprehen&s;ion for his &s;afety; and for &s;ome years he had plant|ed &s;pies near the ca&s;tle of Athlin, to ob&s;erve all that pa&s;&s;ed within it, and to give him immediate intelligence of every warlike preparation. A tran&s;action &s;o &s;triking, and &s;o public as that which had occurred on the day of the fe&s;tival, when the whole people &s;wore to avenge the murder of their Chief, it was not probable would e&s;cape the vigilant eye of his mercenaries: the circum&s;tance had been communicated to him with all the exaggerations of fear and wonder, and had given him the &s;ignal for
<PB N="31" REF="031067_0030_0FEA9BD43075EA10">
defence. The accounts &s;ent him of the military preparations which were forming, convinced him that this defence would &s;oon be called for; and, laughing at the idle tales which were told him of di&s;tant wars, he ha&s;tened to &s;tore his garri&s;on with arms and with men, and held him&s;elf in readi|ne&s;s to receive the a&s;&s;ailants. The Baron had conducted his plans with all that pow|er of contrivance which the &s;ecrecy of the bu&s;ine&s;s demanded; and it was his de&s;ign to &s;uffer the enemy to mount his walls, and to put them to the &s;word, when the purpo&s;e of this deep laid &s;tratagem had been nearly defeated by the drow&s;ine&s;s of the centinels who were po&s;ted to give &s;ig|nal of their approach.</P>
<P>The fortitude of Matilda fainted under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o heavy a calamity; &s;he was attacked with a violent illne&s;s, which had nearly terminated her &s;orrows and her life; and had rendered unavailing all the tender cares of her daughter. The&s;e ten|der cares, however, were not Ineffectual;

&s;he revived, and they a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;upport her in the &s;evere hours of affliction, which the unknown fate of the Earl occa&s;ioned.

Yet the idea of her brother, &s;urrounded with the horrors of impri&s;onment and death, would often obtrude it&s;elf on her imagination, with an empha&s;is which almo&s;t overcame her rea|&s;on.

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Earl, after being loaded with fet|ters, was conducted to the chief pri|&s;on of the ca&s;tle, and left alone to the bitter reflections of defeat and uncertain de&s;tiny; but misfortune, though it might &s;hake, could not overcome his firmne&s;s; and hope had not yet entirely for&s;aken him. It is the peculiar attribute of great minds, to bear up with encrea&s;ing force again&s;t the &s;hock of misfortune; with them the nerves of re&s;i&s;tance &s;trengthen with attack; and they may be &s;aid to &s;ubdue adver&s;ity with her own weapons.</P>
<P>Reflection, at length, afforded him time to examine his pri&s;on: it was a &s;quare room, which formed the &s;ummit of a tower built on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, round which the bleak winds howled mournfully; the in&s;ide of the apartment was old and falling to decay: a &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">attra&s;s, which lay in one corner of the
<PB N="34" REF="031067_0033_0FEA9B5AEF75FE70">
room, a broken matted chair, and a tot|tering table, compo&s;ed its furniture; two &s;mall and &s;trongly grated windows, which admitted a &s;ufficient degree of light and air, afforded him on one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide a view into an inner court, and on the other a dreary pro&s;pect of the wild and barren Highlands.</P>
<P>Alleyn was conveyed through dark and winding pa&s;&s;ages to a di&s;tant part of the ca&s;tle, where at length a &s;mall door, bar|red with iron, opened, and di&s;clo&s;ed to him an abode, whence light and hope were equally excluded. He &s;huddered as he entered, and the door was clo&s;ed upon him.</P>
<P>The mind of the Baron, in the mean time, was agitated with all the direful pa&s;|&s;ions of hate, revenge, and exulting pride. He racked imagination for the inven|tion of tortures equal to the force of his feelings; and he at length di&s;covered that the &s;ufferings of &s;u&s;pence are &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the mo&s;t terrible evils, when once a&s;certained, of which the contemplation gradually affords to &s;trong minds the means
<PB N="35" REF="031067_0034_0FEA9BD8FADE2CD8">
of endurance. He determined, therefore, that the Earl &s;hould remain confined in the tower, ignorant of his future de&s;tiny; and in the mean while &s;hould be allowed food only &s;ufficient to keep him &s;en&s;ible of his wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>O&s;bert was immer&s;ed in thought, when he heard the door of his pri&s;on unbarred, and the Baron Malcolm &s;tood before him. The heart of O&s;bert &s;welled high with in|dignation, and defiance fla&s;hed in his eyes. "I am come," &s;aid the in&s;ulting victor, "to welcome the Earl of Athlin to my ca&s;tle; and to &s;hew that I can receive my friends with the ho&s;pitality they de&s;erve; but I am yet undetermined what kind of fe&s;tival I &s;hall be&s;tow on his arrival."</P>
<P>"Weak tyrant." returned O&s;bert, his countenance impre&s;&s;ed with the firm dig|nity of virtue, "to in&s;ult the vanqui&s;h|ed, is congenial with the cruel meanne&s;s of the murderer; nor do I expect, that the man who &s;lew the father, will &s;pare the &s;on; but know, that &s;on is
<PB N="36" REF="031067_0035_0FEA9B62ACB34490">
nerved agai&s;t your wrath, and welcomes all that your fears or your cruelty can im|po&s;e."</P>
<P>"Ra&s;h youth," replied the Baron, "your words are air; they fade from &s;en&s;e, and &s;oon your boa&s;ted &s;trength &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ink beneath my power. I go to meditate your de&s;tiny." With the&s;e words he quit|ted the pri&s;on, enraged at the unbending virtue of the Earl.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of the Baron, rou&s;ed in the &s;oul of O&s;bert all tho&s;e oppo&s;ite emotions of furious indignation and tender pity, which the glowing image of his father could ex|cite, and produced a moment of per|fect mi&s;ery. The dreadful energy of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations exa&s;perated his brain al|mo&s;t to madne&s;s; the cool fortitude in which he had &s;o lately gloried, di&s;appear|ed; and he was on the point of re&s;igning his virtue and his life, by means of a &s;hort dagger, which he wore concealed under his ve&s;t, when the &s;oft notes of a lute &s;ur|pri&s;ed his attention. It was accompanied
<PB N="37" REF="031067_0036_0FEA9BE8591C19C0">
by a voice &s;o enchantingly tender and me|lodious, that its &s;ounds fell on the heart of O&s;bert in balmy comfort: it &s;eemed &s;ent by Heaven to arre&s;t his fate:&mdash;the &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion was hu&s;hed within him, and he di&s;&s;olved in tears of pity and con|trition. The mournful tenderne&s;s of the air, declared the per&s;on from whom it came to be a &s;ufferer; and O&s;bert &s;u&s;pect|ed it to proceed from a pri&s;oner like him|&s;elf. The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed. Ab&s;orbed in wonder, he went to the grates in que&s;t of the &s;weet mu&s;ician, but no one was to be &s;een; and he was uncertain whether the &s;ounds aro&s;e from within or from without the ca&s;tle. Of the guard, who brought him his &s;mall allowance of food, he enquired concerning what he had heard; but from him he could not obtain the information he &s;ought, and he was con&s;trained to re|main in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time the ca&s;tle of Athlin, and its neighbourhood, was overwhelmed with di&s;tre&s;s. The news of the Earl's im|pri&s;onment
<PB N="38" REF="031067_0037_0FEA9B64AA34DEE0">
at length reached the ears of the Counte&s;s, and hope once more illu|mined her mind. She immediately &s;ent offers of immen&s;e ran&s;om to the Baron, for the re&s;toration of her &s;on, and the o|ther pri&s;oners; but the ferocity of his na|ture di&s;dained an incomplete triumph. Re|venge &s;ubdued his avarice; and the offers were rejected with the &s;purn of contempt. An additional motive, however, operated in his mind, and confirmed his purpo&s;e. The beauty of Mary had been often report|ed to him in terms which excited his cu|rio&s;ity; and an accidental view he once obtained of her, rai&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion in his &s;oul, which the turbulence of his character would not &s;uffer to be extingui&s;hed. Va|rious were the &s;chemes he had projected to obtain her, none of which had ever been executed; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earl, was a circum&s;tance the mo&s;t favourable to his wi&s;hes, and he re&s;olved to obtain Mary as the future ran&s;om of her brother. He concealed, for the pre&s;ent, his purpo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the tortures of anxiety and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="39" REF="031067_0038_0FEA9BE9F08032E0">
might operate on the mind of the Counte&s;s, to grant him an ea&s;y con&s;ent to the ex|change, and to re&s;ign the victim the wife of her enemy.</P>
<P>The &s;mall remains of the clan, un&s;ub|dued by misfortune, were eager to a&s;&s;em|ble; and, hazardous as was the enterpri&s;e, to attempt the re&s;cue of their Chief. The hope which this undertaking afforded, once more revived the Counte&s;s; but alas! a new &s;ource of &s;orrow was now opened for her: the health of Mary vi&s;ibly declined; &s;he was &s;ilent and pen&s;ive; her tender frame was too &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ufferings of her mind; and the&s;e &s;ufferings were heightened by concealment. She was pre&s;cribed amu&s;ement and gentle exerci&s;e, as the be&s;t re&s;toratives of peace and health. One day, as &s;he was &s;eeking on hor&s;eback the&s;e lo&s;t trea&s;ures, &s;he was tempted by the finene&s;s of the evening to prolong her ride beyond its u&s;ual limits: the &s;un was declining when &s;he entered a wood, who&s;e awful glooms &s;o well accorded with the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ive tone of her mind. The &s;oft &s;ere|nity
<PB N="40" REF="031067_0039_0FEA9B666CDC7770">
of evening, and the &s;till &s;olemnity of the &s;cene, con&s;pired to lull her mind into a plea&s;ing forgetfulne&s;s of its troubles; from which &s;he was, ere long, awakened by the approaching &s;ound of hor&s;es' feet. The thickne&s;s of the foliage limited her view; but looking onward, &s;he thought &s;he perceived through the trees, a glitter|ing of arms; &s;he turned her palfry, and &s;ought the entrance of the wood. The clattering of hoofs advanced in the breeze! her heart mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gave her, and &s;he quickened her pace. Her fears were &s;oon ju&s;tified; &s;he looked back, and beheld three hor&s;e|men armed and di&s;gui&s;ed advancing with the &s;peed of pur&s;uit. Almo&s;t fainting, &s;he flew on the wings of terror; all her efforts were vain; the villains came up; one &s;eiz|ed her hor&s;e, the others fell upon her two attendants: a &s;tout &s;cuffle en&s;ued, but the &s;trength of her &s;ervants &s;oon yielded to the weapons of their adver&s;aries; they were brought to the ground, dragged into the wood, and there left bound to the trees. In the mean time, Mary, who had fainted
<PB N="41" REF="031067_0040_0FEA9BEC10396970">
in the arms of the villain who &s;eized her, was born away through the intricate mazes of the woods; and her terrors may be ea|&s;ily imagined, when &s;he revived, and found her&s;elf in the hands of unknown men. Her dreadful &s;creams, her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, her &s;upplica|tions, were ineffectual; the wretches were deaf alike to pity and to enquiry; they pre&s;erved an inflexible &s;ilence, and &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf conveying towards the mouth of a horrible cavern, when de&s;pair &s;eized her mind, and &s;he lo&s;t all &s;igns of exi&s;tence: in this &s;tate &s;he remained &s;ome time; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe her &s;ituation, when &s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes, and beheld Alleyn, who was watching with the mo&s;t trembling anxiety her return to life, and who&s;e eyes, on &s;eeing her revive, &s;wam in joy and ten|derne&s;s. Wonder, fearful joy, and the various &s;hades of mingled emotions, pa&s;&s;ed in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion over her countenance; her &s;urpri&s;e was encrea&s;ed, when &s;he ob|&s;erved her own &s;ervants &s;tanding by, and could di&s;cover no one but friends. She
<PB N="42" REF="031067_0041_0FEBDCE28F74E8C0">
&s;carcely dared to tru&s;t her &s;en&s;es, but the voice of Alleyn, tremulous with tender|ne&s;s, di&s;&s;olved in a moment the illu&s;ions of fear, and confirmed her in the &s;urpri&s;|ing reality. When &s;he was &s;ufficiently re|covered, they quitted this &s;cene of gloom; they travelled on in a &s;low pace, and the &s;hades of night were fallen long before they reached the ca&s;tle; there di&s;tre&s;s and con|fu&s;ion appeared. The Counte&s;s, alarmed with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions, had di&s;patched her &s;ervants various ways in &s;earch of her child, and her tran&s;ports on again beholding her in &s;afety, prevented her ob&s;erving immediately that it was Alleyn who accompanied her. Joy, however, &s;oon yielded to its equal wonder, when &s;he per|ceived him, and in the tumult of contend|ing emotions, &s;he &s;carce knew which fir&s;t to interrogate. When &s;he had been told the e&s;cape of her daughter, and by whom effected, &s;he prepared to hear, with impa|tient &s;olicitude, news of her beloved &s;on, and the means by which the brave young Highlander had eluded the vigilance of the
<PB N="43" REF="031067_0042_0FEBDBA85632B188">
Baron. Of the Earl, Alleyn could only inform the Counte&s;s, that he was taken pri&s;oner with him&s;elf, within the walls of the fortre&s;s, as they fought &s;ide by &s;ide; that he was conducted, unwounded, to a tower &s;ituated on the ea&s;t angle of the ca&s;|tle, where he was &s;till confined. Him&s;elf had been impri&s;oned in a di&s;tant part of the pile, and had been able to collect no other particulars of the Earl's &s;ituation, than tho&s;e he had related. Of him&s;elf he gave a brief relation of the following cir|cum&s;tances:</P>
<P>After having lain &s;ome weeks in the hor|rible dungeon allotted him, his mind in|volved in the gloom of de&s;pair, and filled with momentary expectation of death, de&s;|peration furni&s;hed him with invention, and he concerted the following plan of e&s;cape:&mdash;He had ob&s;erved, that the guard who brought him his allowance of food, on quitting the dungeon, con&s;tantly &s;ounded his &s;pear again&s;t the pavement near the en|trance. This circum&s;tance excited his &s;ur|pri&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="031067_0043_0FEBDBDE0F6F4758">
and curio&s;ity. A ray of hope beamed through the gloom of his dungeon. He examined the &s;pot, as well as the ob&s;curity of the place would permit; it was paved with flag &s;tones like the other parts of the cell, and the paving was every where equally firm. He, however, became cer|tain, that &s;ome means of e&s;cape was con|cealed beneath that part, for the guard was con&s;tant in examining it by &s;triking that &s;pot, and treading more firmly on it; and this he endeavoured to do without being ob&s;erved. One day, immediately after the departure of the guard, Alleyn &s;et him&s;elf to unfa&s;ten the pavement; this, with much patience and indu&s;try, he effected, by means of a &s;mall knife which had e&s;caped the &s;earch of the &s;oldiers. He found the earth beneath hard, and without any &s;ymp|toms of being lately di&s;turbed; but after digging a few feet, he arrived at a trap door; he trembled with eagerne&s;s. It was now almo&s;t night, and he was overcome with wearine&s;s; he doubted whether he &s;hould be able to penetrate through the
<PB N="45" REF="031067_0044_0FEBDBEAAEAAAF90">
door, and what other ob&s;tructions were behind it, before the next day. He there|fore, threw the earth again into the hole, and endeavoured to clo&s;e the pavement; with much difficulty, he trod the earth into the opening, but the pavement he was unable exactly to replace. It was too dark to ex|amine the &s;tones; and he found, that even if he &s;hould be able to make them fit, the pavement could not be made firm. His mind and body were now overcome, and he threw him&s;elf on the ground in an ago|ny of de&s;pair. It was midnight, when the return of his &s;trength and &s;pirits produced another effort. He tore the earth up with ha&s;ty violence, cut round the lock of the trap door, and rai&s;ing it, unwilling to he|&s;itate or con&s;ider, &s;prung through the a|perture. The vault was of con&s;iderable depth, and he was thrown down by the violence of the fall: an hollow echo, which &s;eemed to murmur at a di&s;tance, convinced him that the place was of con&s;iderable ex|tent. He had no light to direct him, and was therefore obliged to walk with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="46" REF="031067_0045_0FEBDBEE18A94F08">
extended, in &s;ilent and fearful examination. After having wandered through the void a con&s;iderable time, he came to a wall, along which he groped with anxious care; it conducted him onward for a length of way: it turned; he followed, and his hand touched the cold iron work of a barred window. He felt the gentle undulation of the air upon his face; and to him, who had been &s;o long confined among the damp vapours of a dungeon, this was a moment of luxury. The air gave him &s;trength; and the means of e&s;cape, which now &s;eemed pre&s;ented to him, renewed his courage. He &s;et his foot again&s;t the wall, and gra&s;p|ing a bar with his hand, found it gradual|ly yield to his &s;trength, and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive efforts, he entirely di&s;placed it. He at|tempted another, but it was more firmly fixed, and every effort to loo&s;en it was in|effectual; he found that it was fa&s;tened in a large &s;tone of the wall, and that to re|move this &s;tone, was his only means of di&s;placing the bar; he &s;et him&s;elf, there|fore, again to work with his knife, and
<PB N="47" REF="031067_0046_0FEBDBFA583FE2C0">
with much patience, loo&s;ened the mortar &s;ufficiently to effect his purpo&s;e. After &s;ome hours, for the darkne&s;s made his labour tedious, and &s;ometimes ineffectual, he had removed &s;everal of the bars, and had made an opening almo&s;t &s;ufficient to permit his e&s;cape, when the dawn of light appeared; he now di&s;covered with inex|pre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h, that the grate opened in|to an inner court of the ca&s;tle, and even while he he&s;itated, he could perceive &s;ol|diers de&s;cending &s;lowly into the court, from the narrow &s;tairca&s;es which led to their apartments. His heart &s;ickened at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight. He re&s;ted again&s;t the wall in a pau&s;e of de&s;|pair, and was on the point of &s;pringing in|to the court, to make an effort at e&s;cape, or die in the attempt, when he perceived, by the encrea&s;ing light which fell acro&s;s the vault, a ma&s;&s;y door in the oppo&s;ite wall; he ran towards it, and endeavoured to open it; it was fa&s;tened by a lock and &s;everal bolts. He &s;truck again&s;t it with his foot, and the hollow &s;ound which was re|turned, convinced him that there were
<PB N="48" REF="031067_0047_0FEBDBFDBA4C7040">
vaults beyond; and by the direction of the&s;e vaults, he was certain that they mu&s;t extend to the outer walls of the ca&s;tle; if he could gain the&s;e vaults, and penetrate beyond them in the darkne&s;s of the en|&s;uing night, it would be ea&s;y to leap the wall, and cro&s;s the ditch; but it was im|po&s;&s;ible to cut away the lock, before the return of his guard, who regularly vi&s;ited the cell &s;oon after the dawn of day. After &s;ome con&s;ideration, therefore, he deter|mined to &s;ecrete him&s;elf in a dark part of the vault, and there await the entrance of the guard, who on ob&s;erving the deranged bars of the grate, would conclude, that he had e&s;caped through the aperture. He had &s;carcely placed him&s;elf according to his plan, when he heard the door of the dun|geon unbolted; this was in&s;tantly followed by a loud voice, which &s;ounded down the opening, and "Alleyn" was &s;houted in a tone of fright and con&s;ternation. After re|peating the call, a man jumped into the vault. Alleyn, though him&s;elf concealed in darkne&s;s, could perceive, by the
<PB N="49" REF="031067_0048_0FEBDC0A28D8D538">
faint light which fell upon the &s;pot, a &s;ol|dier with a drawn &s;word in his hand. He approached the grate with execrations, ex|amined it, and proceeded to the door; it was fa&s;t; he returned to the grate, and then proceeded along the walls, tracing them with the point of his &s;word. He at length approached the &s;pot where Alleyn was concealed, who felt the &s;word &s;trike upon his arm, and in&s;tantly gra&s;ping the hand which held it, the weapon fell to the ground. A &s;hort &s;cuffle en&s;ued; Alleyn threw down his adver&s;ary, and &s;tanding over him, &s;eized the &s;word, and pre&s;ented it to his brea&s;t; the &s;oldier called for mer|cy. Alleyn, always unwilling to take the life of another, and con&s;idering that if the &s;oldier was &s;lain, his comrades would cer|tainly follow to the vault, returned him his &s;word. "Take your life, &s;aid he, "your death can avail me nothing;&mdash;take it, and if you can, go tell Malcolm, that an inno|cent man has endeavoured to e&s;cape de&s;|truction. The guard, &s;truck with his con|duct,

aro&s;e from the ground in &s;ilence, he received his &s;word, and followed Alleyn to the trap door. They returned into the dungeon, where Alleyn was once more left alone. The &s;oldier undetermined how to act, went to find his comrades; on the way he met Malcolm, who, ever re&s;tle&s;s and vigilant, frequently walked the ram|parts at an early hour. He enquired if all was well. The &s;oldier, fearful of di&s;covery, and unaccu&s;tomed to di&s;&s;emble, he&s;itated at the que&s;tion; and the &s;tern air a&s;&s;umed by Malcolm, compelled him to relate what had happened. The baron, with much har&s;hne&s;s, reprobated his neglect, and im|mediately followed him to the dungeon, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he loaded Alleyn with in&s;ult. He examined the cell, de&s;cended into the vault, and returned to the dungeon, &s;tood by, while a chain, which had been fetched from a di&s;tant part of the ca&s;tle, was fixed into the wall;&mdash;to this Alleyn was fa&s;ten|ed. "We will not long confine you thus," &s;aid Malcolm, as he quitted the cell, "a few days &s;hall re&s;tore you to the liberty
<PB N="51" REF="031067_0050_0FEBDC4CF16C7F10">
you are &s;o fond of; but as a conqueror ought to have &s;pectators of his triumph, you mu&s;t wait till a number is collected &s;ufficient to witne&s;s the death of &s;o great an hero." "I di&s;dain your in&s;ults," re|turned Alleyn, "and am equally able to &s;upport misfortune, and de&s;pi&s;e a tyrant." Malcolm retired, enraged at the boldne&s;s of his pri&s;oner, and uttering menaces on the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the guard, who vainly endeavoured to ju&s;tify him&s;elf. "His &s;afety be upon your head," &s;aid the Baron. The &s;oldier was &s;hocked, and turned away in &s;ullen &s;ilence, Dread of his pri&s;oner's ef|fecting an e&s;cape, now &s;eized his mind; the words of Malcolm filled him with re|&s;entment, while gratitude towards Alleyn, for the life he had &s;pared, operated with with the&s;e &s;entiments, and he he&s;itated whether he &s;hould obey the Baron, or de|liver Alleyn, and fly his oppre&s;&s;or. At noon, he carried him his cu&s;tomary food; Alleyn was not &s;o lo&s;t in mi&s;ery, but that he ob&s;erved the gloom which hung upon his features; his heart foreboded impend|ing
<PB N="52" REF="031067_0051_0FEBDC58868841A8">
evil: the &s;oldier bore on his tongue the &s;entence of death. He told Alleyn, that the Baron had appointed the following day for his execution; and his people were ordered to attend. Death, however long contemplated, mu&s;t be dreadful when it arrives; this was no more than what Alleyn had expected, and on what he had brought his mind to gaze without ter|ror; but his fortitude now &s;unk before its immediate pre&s;ence, and every nerve of his frame thrilled with agony, "Be comfort|ed," &s;aid the &s;oldier, in a tone of pity, "I, too, am no &s;tranger to mi&s;ery; and if you are willing to ri&s;que the danger of dou|ble torture, I will attempt to relea&s;e both you and my&s;elf from the hands of a tyrant." At the&s;e words, Alleyn &s;tarted from the ground in a tran&s;port of delightful wonder: "Tell me not of torture," cried he, "all tortures are equal if death is the end, and from death I may now e&s;cape; lead me but beyond the&s;e walls, and the &s;mall po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions I have, &s;hall be your's forever." "I want then not," replied the generous
<PB N="53" REF="031067_0052_0FEBDC5C13D96008">
&s;oldier, "it is enough for me, that I &s;ave a fellow-creature from de&s;truction." The&s;e words overpowered the heart of Alleyn, and tears of gratitude &s;welled in his eyes. Edric told him, that the door he had &s;een in the vault below, opened into a chain of vaults, which &s;tretched beyond the wall of the ca&s;|tle, and communicated with a &s;ubterrane|ous way, anciently formed as a retreat from the fortre&s;s, and which terminated in the cavern of a fore&s;t at &s;ome di&s;tance. If this door could be opened, their e&s;cape was al|mo&s;t certain. They con&s;ulted on the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to be taken. The &s;oldier gave Alleyn a knife larger than the one he had, and directed him to cut round the lock, which was all that with held their pa&s;&s;age. Edric's office of centinel was propitious to their &s;cheme, and it was agreed that at midnight they &s;hould de&s;cend the vaults. Edric, after having unfa&s;tened the chain, left the cell, and Alleyn &s;et him&s;elf again to remove the pavement, which had been already re|placed by order of the Baron. The near
<PB N="54" REF="031067_0053_0FEBDC62A6433638">
pro&s;pect of deliverance now gladdened his &s;pirits; his knife was better formed for his purpo&s;e; and he worked with alacrity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e. He arrived at the trap door, and once more leaped into the vault. He ap|plied him&s;elf to the lock of the door, which was extremely thick, and it was with dif|ficulty he &s;eparated them; with trembling hands he undrew the bolts, the door un|clo&s;ed, and di&s;covered to him the vaults. It was evening when he fini&s;hed his work. He was but ju&s;t returned to the dungeon, and had thrown him&s;elf on the ground to re&s;t, when the &s;ound of a di&s;tant &s;tep caught his ear; he li&s;tened to its advance with trembling eagerne&s;s. At length the door was unbolted; Alleyn, breathle&s;s with expectation, &s;tarted up, and beheld not his &s;oldier, but another; the opening was a|gain di&s;covered, and all was now over. The &s;oldier brought a pitcher of wa|ter, and ca&s;ting round the place a look of &s;ullen &s;crutiny, departed in &s;ilence. The &s;tretch of human endurance was now ex|ceeded, and Alleyn &s;unk down in a &s;tate
<PB N="55" REF="031067_0054_0FEBDC72CEABAD20">
of torpidity. On recovering, he found him&s;elf again enveloped in the horrors of darkne&s;s, &s;ilence, and de&s;pair. Yet amid all his &s;ufferings, he di&s;dained to doubt the integrity of his &s;oldier: we naturally re|coil from painful &s;en&s;ations, and it is one of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures of a noble mind, to doubt the &s;incerity of tho&s;e in whom it has confided. Alleyn concluded, that the conver&s;ation of the morning had been overheard, and that this guard had been &s;ent to examine the cell, and to watch his movements. He believed that Edric was now, by his own genero&s;ity, involved in de&s;truction; and in the energy of this thought, he forgot for a moment his own &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Midnight came, but Edric did not ap|pear; his doubts were now confirmed into certainty, and he re&s;igned him&s;elf to the horrid tranquillity of mute de&s;pair. He heard, from a di&s;tance, the clock of the ca&s;tle &s;trike one; it &s;eemed to &s;ound the knell of death; it rou&s;ed his benumbed
<PB N="56" REF="031067_0055_0FEBDBD7D41EF0A0">
&s;en&s;es, and he ro&s;e from the ground in an agony of acute&s;t recollection. Suddenly he heard the &s;teps of two per&s;ons advancing down the avenue; he &s;tarted, and li&s;tened. Malcolm and murder aro&s;e to his mind; he doubted not that the &s;oldier had reported what he had &s;een in the evening, and that the per&s;ons whom he now heard, were coming to execute the final orders of the Baron. They now drew near the dungeon, when &s;uddenly he remembered the door in the vault. His &s;en&s;es had been &s;o &s;tunned by the appearance of the &s;tranger, and his mind &s;o occupied with a feeling of de&s;pair, as to exclude every idea of e&s;cape; and in the energy of his &s;ufferings he had forgot this la&s;t re&s;ource. It now fla&s;hed like light|ning upon his mind; he &s;prung to the trap|door, and his feet had &s;carcely touched the bottom of the vault, when he heard the bolts of the dungeon undraw: he had ju&s;t reached the entrance of the inner vault, when a voice &s;ounded from above. He pau&s;ed, and knew it to be Edric's. Ap|prehen&s;ion &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind,
<PB N="57" REF="031067_0056_0FEBDC7F0A9DF0F8">
that he he&s;itated whether he &s;hould di&s;co|ver him&s;elf; but a moment of recollection di&s;&s;ipated every ignoble &s;u&s;picion of Edric's fidelity, and he an&s;wered the call. Imme|diately Edric de&s;cended, followed by the &s;oldier who&s;e former appearance had filled Alleyn with de&s;pair, and whom Edric now introduced as his faithful friend and com|rade, who like him&s;elf, was weary of the oppre&s;&s;ion of Malcolm, and who had re|&s;olved to fly with them, and e&s;cape his ri|gour. This was a moment of happine&s;s too great for thought! Alleyn, in the con|fu&s;ion of his joy, and in his impatience to &s;eize the moment of deliverance, &s;carcely heard the words of Edric. Edric having returned to fa&s;ten the door of the dungeon, to delay pur&s;uit, and given Alleyn a &s;word which he had brought for him, led the way through the vaults. The profound &s;ilence of the place was interrupted only by the echoes of their foot&s;teps, which running through the dreary cha&s;ms in confu&s;ed whi&s;perings, filled their imaginations with terror. In traver&s;ing the&s;e gloomy and de|&s;olate
<PB N="58" REF="031067_0057_0FEBDC8A18155050">
rece&s;&s;es they often pau&s;ed to li&s;ten, and often did their fears give them the di&s;|tant &s;ounds of pur&s;uit. On quitting the vaults, they entered an avenue, winding, and of con&s;iderable length, from whence branched &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages into the rock. It was clo&s;ed by a low and narrow door, which opened upon a flight of &s;teps, that led to the &s;ubterraneous way under the ditch of the ca&s;tle. Edric knew the intricacies of the place: they entered, and clo&s;ing the door began to de&s;cend, when the lamp which Edric carried in his hand was blown out by the current of the wind, and they were left in total darkne&s;s. Their feelings may be more ea&s;ily imagined than de&s;crib|ed: they had, however, no way but to pro|ceed, and grope with cautious &s;teps the the dark aby&s;s. Having continued to de&s;|cend for &s;ome time, their feet reached the bottom, and they found them&s;elves once more on even ground; but Edric knew they had yet another flight to encounter, before they could gain the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age under the fo&s;&s;&eacute;, and for which it
<PB N="59" REF="031067_0058_0FEBDC979664BE08">
required their utmo&s;t caution to &s;earch. They were proceeding with &s;low and wary &s;teps, when the foot of Alleyn &s;tumbled upon &s;omething which clattered like bro|ken armour, and endeavouring to throw it from him, he felt the weight re&s;i&s;t his effort: he &s;tooped to di&s;cover what it was, and found in his gra&s;p the cold hand of a dead per&s;on. Every nerve thrilled with horror at the touch, and he &s;tarted back in an agony of terror. They remained for &s;ome time in &s;ilent di&s;may, unable to re|turn, yet fearful to proceed, when a faint light which &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the bot|tom of the la&s;t de&s;cent, gleamed upon the walls, and di&s;covered to them the &s;econd &s;tairca&s;e, and at their feet the pale and di&s;|figured corp&s;e of a man in armour, while at a di&s;tance they could di&s;tingui&s;h the figures of men. At this &s;ight their hearts died within them, and they gave them&s;elves up for lo&s;t. They doubted not but the men whom they &s;aw were the murderers; that they belonged to the Baron; and were in &s;earch of &s;ome fugitives from the ca&s;tle.
<PB N="60" REF="031067_0059_0FEBDC9BD619CE70">
Their only chance of concealment was to remain where they were; but the light appeared to advance, and the faces of the men to turn towards them. Winged with terror, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought the fir&s;t a&s;cent, and flying up the &s;teps, reached the door, which they endeavoured to open, that they might hide them&s;elves from pur&s;uit among the intricacies of the rock; their efforts, how|ever, were vain, for the door was fa&s;tened by a &s;pring lock, and the key was on the other &s;ide. Compelled to give breath to their fears, they ventured to look back, and found them&s;elves again in total dark|ne&s;s; they pau&s;ed upon the &s;teps, and li&s;t|ening, all was &s;ilent. They re&s;ted here a con&s;iderable time; no foot&s;teps &s;tartled them; no ray of light darted through the gloom; every thing &s;eemed hu&s;hed in the &s;ilence of death: they re&s;olved once more to venture forward; they gained again the bottom of the fir&s;t de&s;cent, and &s;huddering as they approached the &s;pot where they knew the corp&s;e was laid, they groped to avoid its horrid touch, when &s;uddenly the
<PB N="61" REF="031067_0060_0FEBDC9F5A417368">
light again appeared, and in the &s;ame place where they had fir&s;t &s;een it. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> petrified with-with de&s;pair. The light, how|ever, moved &s;lowly onward, and di&s;appear|ed in the windings of the avenue. After remaining a long time in &s;ilent &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and finding no further ob&s;tacle, they ven|tured to proceed. The light had di&s;cover|ed to them their &s;ituation, and the &s;tair|ca&s;e, and they now moved with greater certainty. They reached the bottom in &s;afety, and without any fearful interrupti|on; they li&s;tened, and again the &s;ilence of the place was undi&s;turbed. Edric knew they were now under the fo&s;&s;&eacute;, their way was plain before them, and their hopes were renewed in the belief, that the light and the people they had &s;een, had taken a different direction, Edric knowing there were various pa&s;&s;ages branching from the main avenue which led to different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the rock.

from the cavern. An abrupt turning in the pa&s;&s;age confirmed at once this &s;uppo&s;ition, and extingui&s;hed the hope which had at|tended it; for the light of a lamp bur&s;t &s;uddenly upon them, and exhibited to their &s;ickening eyes, the figures of four men in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> attitude of menace, with their &s;words pointed ready to receive them. Alleyn drew his &s;word, and advanced, "We will die hardly," cried he. At the &s;ound of his voice, the weapons in&s;tantly dropped from the hands of his adver&s;aries, and they advanced to meet him in a tran&s;port of joy. Alleyn recognized with a&s;toni&s;hment, in the faces of the three &s;trangers, his faithful friends and followers; and Edric in that of the fourth a fellow &s;oldier. The &s;ame pur|po&s;e had a&s;&s;embled them all in the &s;ame &s;pot. They quitted the cave together; and Alleyn, in the joyful experience of unex|pected deliverance, re&s;olved never more to admit de&s;pair. They concluded, that the body which they had pa&s;&s;ed in the avenue, was that of &s;ome per&s;on who had peri&s;hed

either by hunger or by the &s;word in tho&s;e &s;ubterranean labyrinths.</P>
<P>They marched in company till they came within a few miles of the ca&s;tle of Athlin, when Alleyn made known his de&s;ign of collecting his friends, and joining the cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in an attempt to relea&s;e the Earl; Edric, and the other &s;oldier, having &s;olemnly en|li&s;ted in the cau&s;e, they parted; Alleyn and Edric pur&s;uing the road to the ca&s;tle, and the others &s;triking off to a different part of the country. Alleyn and Edric had not proceeded far, when the groans of the wounded &s;ervants of Matilda drew them to the wood, in which the proceeding dread|ful &s;cene had been acted.

<P>During the recital of the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, which Alleyn delivered with a mode&s;t bre|vity, the mind of Mary had &s;uffered a va|riety of emotions &s;ympathetic to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="65" REF="031067_0064_0FEBDCBE618F3790">
vici&s;&s;itudes of his &s;ituation. She endeavour|ed to conceal from her&s;elf the particular intere&s;t &s;he felt in his adventures; but &s;o unequal were her efforts to the &s;trength of her emotions, that when Alleyn related the &s;cene of Dunbayne cavern, her cheek grew pale, and &s;he relap&s;ed into a fainting fit. The circum&s;tance alarmed the pene|tration of the Counte&s;s; but the known weakne&s;s of her daughter's frame appeared a probable cau&s;e of the di&s;order, and re|pre&s;&s;ed her fir&s;t apprehen&s;ion. It gave to Alleyn a mixed delight of hope and fear, &s;uch as he had never known before; for the fir&s;t time he dared to acknowledge to his own heart that he loved, and that heart for the fir&s;t time thrilled with the hope of being loved again.</P>
<P>He received from the Counte&s;s the warm overflowings of a heart grateful for the pre&s;ervation of her child, and from Mary a blu&s;h which &s;poke more than her tongue could utter. But the minds of all were
<PB N="66" REF="031067_0065_0FEBDCC00C6602E0">
involved in the utmo&s;t perplexity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the rank and identity of the author of the plan, nor could they di&s;cover any clue which would lead them through this intri|cate maze of wonder, to the villain who had fabricated &s;o diabolical a &s;cheme. Their &s;u&s;picions, at length, re&s;ted upon the Ba|ron Malcolm, and this &s;uppo&s;ition was confirmed by the appearance of the hor&s;e|men, who evidently acted only as the a|gents of &s;uperior power. Their conjectures were indeed ju&s;t. Malcolm was the author of the &s;cheme. It had been planned, and he had given orders to his people to exe|cute it long before the Earl fell into his hands. They had, however, found no op|portunity of accompli&s;hing the de&s;ign when the ca&s;tle was &s;urpri&s;ed, and in the con&s;e|quent tumult of his mind, the Baron had forgot to withdraw his orders.</P>
<P>Alleyn expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ign of collecting the &s;mall remnant of his friends, and unit|ing with the clan in attempting the re&s;cue
<PB N="67" REF="031067_0066_0FEBDCD1F02F24E0">
of the Earl. "Noble youth," exclaimed the Counte&s;s, unable longer to repre&s;s her admiration, "how can I ever repay your generous &s;ervices! Am I then to receive both my children at your hands? Go&mdash;, my clan are now collecting for a &s;econd at|tempt upon the walls of Dunoayne,&mdash;go! lead them to conque&s;t, and re&s;tore to me my &s;on." The languid eyes of Mary re|kindled at the&s;e words, &s;he glowed with the hope of cla&s;ping once more to her bo|&s;om her long lo&s;t brother; but the &s;uffu|&s;ions of hope were &s;oon chaced by the chil|ly touch of fear, for it was Alleyn who was to lead the enterprize, and it was Alleyn who might fall in the attempt. The&s;e contrary emotions unveiled to her at once the &s;tate of her affections, and &s;he &s;aw in the eye of fancy, the long train of inquietudes and &s;orrows which were likely to en&s;ue. She &s;ought to obliterate from her mind every remembrance of the pa&s;t, and of the fatal knowledge which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;clo&s;ed to her; but &s;he &s;ought in vain,

<P>Alleyn pa&s;&s;ed that night at the ca&s;tle, and the next morning, after taking leave of the Counte&s;s and her daughter, to whom his eyes bade a re&s;pectful and mournful adieu, he departed with Edric for his fa|ther's cottage, impatient to acquaint the good old man with his &s;afety, and to rou&s;e to arms his &s;lumbering friends. The breath of love had now rai&s;ed into flame tho&s;e &s;parks of ambition which had &s;o long been kind|ling in his brea&s;t; he was not only eager to avenge the cau&s;e of injured virtue, and to re&s;cue from mi&s;ery and death, the &s;on of the Chief whom he had been ever taught to reverence, but he panted to a|venge

<P>MEANWHILE the Earl remained a &s;olitary pri&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er in the tower; un|certain fate was yet &s;u&s;pended over him; he had, however, a magnanimity in his nature which baffled much of the cruel ef|fort of the Baron. He had prepared his mind by habitual contemplation for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and although that wor&s;t was death, he could now look to it even with &s;erenity. The&s;e violent tran&s;ports which had a&s;&s;ailed him on &s;ight of the Baron, were, &s;ince he was no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> longer &s;ubject to his pre&s;ence, reduced within their proper limits; yet he anxiou&s;ly avoided dwelling on the memo|ry of his father, le&s;t tho&s;e dreadful &s;en&s;a|tions &s;hould threaten him with returning torture. Whenever he permitted him&s;elf to think of the &s;ufferings of the Counte&s;s and his &s;i&s;ter, his heart melted with a &s;or|row that almo&s;t unnerved him; much he wi&s;hed to know how they &s;upported this trial, and much he wi&s;hed that he could
<PB N="71" REF="031067_0070_0FEBDBA66FC13840">
convey to them intelligence of his &s;tate. He endeavoured to ab&s;tract his mind from his &s;ituation, and &s;ought to make him&s;elf artificial comforts even from the barren objects around him; his chief amu&s;ement was in ob&s;erving the manners and cu&s;|toms of the birds of prey which lodged them&s;elves on the battlements of his tower, and the rapacity of their nature furni&s;hed him with too ju&s;t a parallel to the habits of men.</P>
<P>As he was one day &s;tanding at the grate which looked upon the ca&s;tle, ob&s;erving the progre&s;s of the&s;e birds, his ear caught the &s;ound of that &s;weet lute who&s;e notes had once &s;aved him from de&s;truction; it was accompanied by the &s;ame melodious voice he had formerly heard, and which now &s;ung with impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s the following air:</P>

She was dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of a widow, and the black veil which &s;haded her forehead, and
<PB N="73" REF="031067_0072_0FEBDBC989C41770">
gave a fine expre&s;&s;ion to her countenance, devolved upon the ground in a length of train, and heightened the natural maje&s;ty of her figure; &s;he moved with &s;low &s;teps, and was &s;upported by the young lady who&s;e veil half di&s;clo&s;ed a countenance where beauty was touched with &s;orrow and inimi|table expre&s;&s;ion; the elegance of her form, and the dignity of her air, proclaimed her to be of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank. On her arm was hung that l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te, who&s;e melody had ju&s;t charmed the attention of the Earl, who was now fixed in wonder at what he be|held, that was equalled only by his admi|ration. They retired through a gate on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the court, and were &s;een no more. O&s;bert followed them with his eyes, which for &s;ome time remained fixed upon the door through which they had di&s;|appeared, almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of their depar|ture. When he returned to him&s;elf, he di&s;covered, as if for the fir&s;t time, that he was in &s;olitude. He conjectured that the&s;e &s;trangers were confined by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="74" REF="031067_0073_0FEBDBD6521D4888">
power of the Baron, and his eyes were &s;uf|fu&s;ed with tears of pity. When he con&s;i|dered that &s;o much beauty and dignity were the unre&s;i&s;ting victims of a tyrant, his heart &s;welled high with indignation, his pri&s;on became intolerable to him, and he longed to become at once the champion of virtue, and the deliverer of oppre&s;&s;ed innocence. The character of Malcolm a|ro&s;e to his mind black with accumulated guilt, and aggravated the dete&s;tation with which he had even contemplated it: the hateful idea nerved his &s;oul with a confi|dence of revenge. Of the guard, who en|tered, he enquired concerning the &s;trang|ers, but could obtain no po&s;itive informa|tion; he came to impart other news; to prepare the Earl for death; the morrow was appointed for his execution. He received the intelligence with the firm hardihood of indignant virtue, di&s;daining to &s;olicit, and di&s;da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing to repine; and his mind yet gra&s;ped the idea of revenge. He drove from his thoughts, with precipitation, the
<PB N="75" REF="031067_0074_0FEBDBE22051A6B0">
tender ideas of his mother and &s;i&s;ter; re|membrances which would &s;ubdue his for|titude without effecting any beneficial pur|po&s;e. He was told of the e&s;cape of Alleyn; this intelligence gave him inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure, and he knew this faithful youth would undertake to avenge his death.</P>
<P>When the news of Alleyn's flight had reached the Baron, his &s;oul was &s;tung with rage, and he called for the guards of the dungeon; they were no where to be found; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and after a long &s;earch it was known that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they were fled with their pri&s;oner; the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> flight of the other captives was al&s;o di&s;co|vered. This circum&s;tance exa&s;perated the pa&s;&s;ion of Malcolm to the utmo&s;t, and he gave orders that the life of the remaining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">entinal &s;hould be forfeited for the treache|ry of his comrades, and his own negli|gence; when recollecting the Earl, whom in the heat of his re&s;entment he had for|got, his heart exulted in the opportunity he afforded of complete revenge; and in
<PB N="76" REF="031067_0075_0FEBDBFC22AF5560">
the fullne&s;s of joy with which he pronoun|ced his &s;entence, he retracted the condem|nation of the trembling guard. The mo|ment after he had di&s;patched the me&s;&s;en|ger with his re&s;olve to the Earl, his heart faultered from its purpo&s;e. Such is the al|ternate violence of evil pa&s;&s;ions, that they never &s;uffer their &s;ubjects to act with con&s;i&s;tency, but, torn by conflicting ener|gies, the gratification of one propen&s;ity is de&s;truction to the enjoyment of another; and the moment in which they imagine happine&s;s in their gra&s;p, is to them the mo|ment of di&s;appointment. Thus it was with the Baron; his &s;oul &s;eemed to attain its full enjoyment in the contemplation of re|venge, till the idea of Mary inflamed his heart with an oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ion; his wi&s;hes had caught new ardor from di&s;appoint|ment, for he had heard that Mary had been once in the power of his emi&s;&s;aries; and perhaps the pain which recoils upon the mind from every fruitle&s;s effort of wick|ne&s;s, &s;erved to encrea&s;e the energies of his
<PB N="77" REF="031067_0076_0FEBDC036ED03120">
de&s;ires. He &s;purned the thought of relin|qui&s;hing the pur&s;uit, yet there appeared to be no method of obtaining its object, but by &s;acrificing his favourite pa&s;&s;ion; for he had little doubt of obtaining Mary, when it &s;hould be known that he re&s;olved not to grant the life of the Earl upon any other ran&s;om. The balance of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions hung in his mind in &s;uch nice equilibrium, that it was for &s;ome time uncertain which would preponderate; revenge, at length, yielded to love; but he re&s;olved to pre|&s;erve the torture of expected death, by keeping the Earl ignorant of his reprieve till the la&s;t moment.</P>
<P>The Earl awaited death with the &s;ame &s;tern fortitude with which he received its &s;entence, and was led from the tower to the platform of the ca&s;tle, &s;ilent and un|moved. He beheld the preparations for his execution, the in&s;truments of death, the guards arranged in files; with an un|daunted mind. The glare of externals
<PB N="78" REF="031067_0077_0FEBDC4F8F6A8C68">
had no longer power over his imagination. He beheld every object with indifference, but that on which his eye now re&s;ted; it was on the murderer, who exhibited him|&s;elf in all the pride of exulting conque&s;t: he &s;tarted at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, and his &s;oul &s;hrunk back upon it&s;elf. Di&s;daining, however, to appear di&s;concerted, he endeavoured to re&s;ume his dignity, when the remembrance of his mother, overwhelmed with &s;orrow, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;hed upon his mind, and quite unman|ned him; the tears &s;tarted in his eyes, and he &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground.</P>
<P>On recovering, he found him&s;elf in his pri&s;on, and he was informed that the Ba|ron had granted him a re&s;pite. Malcolm mi&s;taking the cau&s;e of di&s;order in the Earl, thought he had &s;tretched his &s;ufferings to their utmo&s;t limits; he therefore had or|dered him to be re-conveyed to the tower.</P>
<P>A &s;cene &s;o &s;triking and &s;o public as that which had ju&s;t been performed at the ca&s;|tle
<PB N="79" REF="031067_0078_0FEBDC5A1E2DB540">
of Dunbayne, was a &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e to the whole country; it was &s;oon reported to the Counte&s;s with a variety of additional circum&s;tances, among which it was affirm|ed, that the Earl had been really executed. Overwhelmed with this intelligence, Ma|tilda relap&s;ed into her former di&s;order. Sickne&s;s had rendered Mary le&s;s able to &s;up|port the &s;hock, and to apply that comfort to the afflictions of her mother, which had once been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully admini&s;tered. The phy&s;ician pronounced the malady of the Counte&s;s to be &s;eated in the mind, and beyond the reach of human &s;kill, when one day a letter was brought to her, the &s;uper|&s;cription of which was written in the hand of O&s;bert; &s;he knew the characters, and bur&s;ting the &s;eal, read that her &s;on was yet alive, and did not de&s;pair of throwing him|&s;elf once more at her feet. He reque&s;ted that the remains of his clan might immedi|ately attempt his relea&s;e. He de&s;cribed in what part of the ca&s;tle his pri&s;on was &s;itua|ted, and thought, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
<PB N="80" REF="031067_0079_0FEBDC74829A4280">
long &s;caling-ladders and ropes, contrived in the manner he directed, he might be a|ble to effect his e&s;cape through the grate. This letter was a reviving cordial to the Counte&s;s and to Mary.</P>
<P>Alleyn was indefatigable in collecting followers for the enterprize he had engag|ed in. On receiving intelligence of the &s;afety of the Earl, he vi&s;ited the clan, and was &s;trenuous in exhorting them to imme|diate action. They required little incite|ment to a cau&s;e in which every heart was &s;o much intere&s;ted, and for which every hand was already bu&s;ied in preparation. The&s;e preparations were at length com|pleted; Alleyn, at the head of his party, joined the a&s;&s;embled clan. The Counte&s;s for a &s;econd time beheld from the ramparts the departure of her people upon the &s;ame hazardous enterprize; the pre&s;ent &s;cene revived in her mind a &s;ad remembrance of the pa&s;t; the &s;ame tender fears, and the &s;ame prayers for &s;ucce&s;s &s;he now gave to
<PB N="81" REF="031067_0080_0FEBDC8BA29F0598">
their departure; and when they faded in di&s;tance from her &s;ight, &s;he returned into the ca&s;tle di&s;&s;olved in tears. The heart of Mary was torn by a complex &s;orrow, and incapable of longer concealing from her&s;elf the intere&s;t &s;he took in the departure of Al|leyn, her agitation became more apparent. The Counte&s;s in vain endeavoured to com|po&s;e her mind. Mary, affected by her tender concern, and prompted by the na|tural ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, long|ed to make her the confidant of her weak|ne&s;s, if weakne&s;s that can be termed which ari&s;es from gratitude, and from the admi|ration of great and generous qualities; but delicacy and timidity arre&s;ted the half-form|ed &s;entence, and clo&s;ed her lips in &s;ilence. Her health gradually declined under the &s;ecret agitation of her mind; her phy&s;ician knew her di&s;order to originate in &s;uppre&s;&s;|ed &s;orrow, and advi&s;ed, as the be&s;t cordial, a confidential friend. Matilda now per|ceived the cau&s;e of her grief; her former pa&s;&s;ing ob&s;ervations recurred to her memo|ry,
<PB N="82" REF="031067_0081_0FEBDC9DA0571550">
and ju&s;tified her di&s;cernment. She &s;trove by every &s;oothing effort to win her to her confidence. Mary, oppre&s;&s;ed by the idea of ungenerous concealment, re|&s;olved at length to unveil the heart to a mother &s;o tender of her happine&s;s. She told her all her &s;entiments. The Counte&s;s &s;uffered a di&s;tre&s;s almo&s;t equal to that of her daughter; her affectionate heart &s;well|ed with equal wi&s;hes for her happine&s;s; &s;he admired with warme&s;t gratitude the no|ble and a&s;piring virtues of the young High|lander; but the proud nobility of her &s;oul repelled with quick vivacity every idea of union with a youth of &s;uch ignoble birth: &s;he regarded the pre&s;ent attachment as the pa&s;&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion of youthful fancy, and believed that gentle rea&s;oning, aided by time and endeavour, would conquer the enthu&s;ia&s;m of love. Mary li&s;tened with attention to the rea&s;onings of the Counte&s;s; her judgment acknowledged their ju&s;tne&s;s, while her heart regretted their force, She re&s;olved, however, to overcome an attach|ment
<PB N="83" REF="031067_0082_0FEBDCB7D1E763A8">
which would produce on much di&s;|tre&s;s to her family and to her&s;elf. Notwith|&s;tanding her endeavours to exclude Alleyn from her thoughts, the generous and hero|ic qualities of his mind bur&s;t upon her me|mory in all their &s;plendor, &s;he could not but be con&s;cious that he loved her; &s;he &s;aw the &s;truggles of his &s;oul, and the deli|cacy of his pa&s;&s;ion, which made him ever retire in the mo&s;t profound and re&s;pectful &s;ilence from its object. She &s;olicited her mother to a&s;&s;i&s;t in expelling the de&s;tructive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">age from her mind. The Counte&s;s ex|erted every effort to amu&s;e her to forget|fulne&s;s; every hour, except tho&s;e which were given to exerci&s;es nece&s;&s;ary for her health, was devoted to the cultivation of her mind, and the improvement of her va|rious accompli&s;hments. The&s;e endeavours were not un&s;ucce&s;sful; the Counte&s;s with joy ob&s;erved the returning health and tran|quillity of her daughter; and Mary almo&s;t believed &s;he had taught her&s;elf to forget. The&s;e engagements &s;erved al&s;o to beguile

<P>Mi&s;ery yet dwelt in the ca&s;tle of Dun|bayne; for there the virtues were captive, while the vices reigned de&s;potic. The mind of the Baron, ardent and re&s;tle&s;s, knew no peace: torn by conflicting pa&s;|&s;ions, he was him&s;elf the victim of their power.</P>
<P>The Earl knew that his life hung upon the caprice of a tyrant; his mind was ner|ved for the wor&s;t; yet the letter which the compa&s;&s;ion of one of his guards, at the ri&s;que of his life, had undertaken to con|vey to the Counte&s;s, afforded him a faint hope that his people might yet effect his e&s;cape. In this expectation, he &s;pent hour after hour at his grate, wi&s;hing, with trem|bling anxiety, to behold his clan advanc|ing over the di&s;tant hills. The&s;e hills be|came

at length, in a &s;ituation &s;o barren of real comforts, a &s;ource of ideal plea&s;ure to him. He was always at the grate, and of|ten, in the fine evenings of &s;ummer, &s;aw the ladies, who&s;e appearance had &s;o &s;trong|ly excited his admiration and pity, walk on a terrace below the tower.

The parting &s;un trembled on the tops of the mountains, and a &s;ofter &s;hade fell upon the di&s;tant land|&s;cape. The &s;weet tranquillity of evening threw an air of tender melancholy over his mind: his &s;orrows for a while were hu&s;hed; and under the euthu&s;ia&s;m of the hour, he compo&s;ed the following &s;tanzas, which, having committed them to paper, he the next evening dropped upon the terrace.</P>

<P>ONE morning early, the Earl di&s;cern|ed a martial band emerging from the verge of the horizon; his heart wel|comed his hopes, which were &s;oon con|firmed into certainty. It was his faithful people, led on by Alleyn. It was their de|&s;ign to &s;urround and attack the ca&s;tle; and though their numbers gave them but little hopes of conque&s;t, they yet believed that in the tumult of the engagement, they might procure the deliverance of the Earl. With this view they advanced to the walls. The centinels had de&s;cried them at di&s;t|ance; the alarm was given; the trumpets &s;ounded, and the walls of the ca&s;tle were filled with men. The Baron was pre&s;ent, and directed the preparations. The &s;ecret purpo&s;e of his &s;oul was fixed. The clan &s;urrounded the fo&s;&s;e, into which they threw bundles of faggots, and gave the &s;ignal of attack. Scaling ladders were thrown up
<PB N="88" REF="031067_0087_0FEBDBD9765D34B0">
to the window of the tower. The Earl, invigorated with hope and joy, had by the force of his arm, almo&s;t wrenched from its fa&s;tening, one of the iron bars of the grate; his foot was lifted to the &s;tanchion, ready to aid him in e&s;caping through the open|ing, when he was &s;eized by the guards of the Baron, and conveyed precipitately from the pri&s;on. He was led, indignant and de&s;perate, to the lofty ramparts of the ca&s;tle, from whence he beheld Alleyn and his clan, who&s;e eager eyes were once more ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ight of their Chief;&mdash;they were ble&s;&s;ed but for a moment; they be|held their Lord in chains, &s;urrounded with guards, and with the in&s;truments of death. Animated, however, with a la&s;t hope, they renewed the attack with redoubled fury, when the trumpets of the Baron &s;ounded a parley, and they &s;u&s;pended their arms. The Baron appeared on the ramparts; Al|leyn advanced to hear him. "The mo|ment of attack," cried the Baron, is the moment of death to your Chief. If you
<PB N="89" REF="031067_0088_0FEBDBEC36653778">
wi&s;h to pre&s;erve his life, de&s;i&s;t from the a&s;|&s;ault, and depart in peace; and bear this me&s;&s;age to the Counte&s;s, your mi&s;tre&s;s: the Baron Malcolm will accept no other ran&s;om for the life and the liberty of the Earl, than her beauteous daughter, whom he now &s;ues to become his wife. If &s;he ac|cedes to the&s;e terms, the Earl is in&s;tantly liberated,&mdash;if &s;he refu&s;es,&mdash;he dies." The emotions of the Earl, and of Alleyn, on hearing the&s;e words, were inexpre&s;&s;ible. The Earl &s;purned, with haughty virtue, the ba&s;e conce&s;&s;ion. "Give me death," cried he with loud impatience; "the hou&s;e of Athlin &s;hall not be di&s;honoured by alliance with a murderer: renew the attack, my brave people; &s;ince you cannot &s;ave the life, revenge the death of your Chief; he dies contented, &s;ince his death pre&s;erves his family from di&s;honour." The guards in&s;tantly &s;urrounded the Earl.</P>
<P>Alleyn, who&s;e heart, torn by contending emotions, was yet true to the impul&s;e of
<PB N="90" REF="031067_0089_0FEBDBF464220BB8">
honour, on ob&s;erving this, in&s;tantly threw down his arms, refu&s;ing to obey the com|mands of the Earl; a ho&s;tage for who&s;e life he demanded, while he ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle of Athlin with the conditions of the Baron. The clan, following the example of Alleyn, re&s;ted on their arms, while a few prepared to depart with him on the em|ba&s;&s;y. In vain were the remon&s;trances and the command&punc; of the Earl; his people lov|ed him too well to obey them, and his heart was filled with angui&s;h when he &s;aw Alleyn depart from the walls.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Alleyn was highly pitia|ble; all the firm virtues of his &s;oul were called upon to &s;upport it. He was com|mi&s;&s;ioned on an emba&s;&s;y, the alternate con|ditions of which would bring mi&s;ery on the woman he adored, or death to the friend whom he loved.</P>
<P>When the arrival of Alleyn was announ|ced to the counte&s;s, impatient joy thrilled
<PB N="91" REF="031067_0090_0FEBDC0BCC2A8C38">
in her bo&s;om; for &s;he had no doubt that he brought offers of accommodation; and no ran&s;om was pre&s;ented to her imagina|tion, which &s;he would not willingly give for the re&s;toration of her &s;on. At the &s;ound of Alleyn's voice, tho&s;e tumults which had began to &s;ub&s;ide in the heart of Mary, were again revived, and &s;he awoke to the mournful certainty of hopele&s;s en|deavour. Yet &s;he could not repre&s;s a &s;trong emotion of joy on again beholding him. The &s;oft blu&s;h of her cheek &s;hewed the co|lours of her mind, while in endeavouring to &s;hade her feelings, &s;he impelled them in|to &s;tronger light.</P>
<P>The agitations of Alleyn almo&s;t &s;ubdued his &s;trength, when he entered the pre&s;ence of the Counte&s;s; and his vi&s;age, on which was impre&s;&s;ed deep di&s;tre&s;s, and the pale|ne&s;s of fear, betrayed the inward workings of his &s;oul. Matilda was in&s;tantly &s;eized with apprehen&s;ion for the &s;afety of her &s;on, and in a tremulous voice, enquired his
<PB N="92" REF="031067_0091_0FEBDC11B57C0828">
fate. Alleyn told her he was well, pro|ceeding with tender caution to acquaint her with the bu&s;ine&s;s of his emba&s;&s;y, and with the &s;cene to which he had lately been wit|ne&s;s. The &s;entence of the Baron fell like the &s;troke of death upon the heart of Mary, who fainted at the words. Alleyn flew to &s;upport her. In endeavouring to re|vive her daughter, the Counte&s;s was di|verted for a time from the angui&s;h which this intelligence mu&s;t naturally impart. It was long ere Mary returned to life, and &s;he returned only to a &s;en&s;e of wretchedne&s;s. The critical &s;ituation of Matilda can &s;carce|ly be felt in its full extent. Torn by the con|flict of oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, her brain was the &s;eat of tumult, and wild di&s;may. Which ever way &s;he looked, de&s;truction clo&s;ed the view. The murderer of the hu&s;band, now &s;ought to murder the happine&s;s of the daughter. On the &s;entence of the mother hung the final fate of the &s;on. In reject|ing the&s;e terms, &s;he would give him in|&s;tant death; in accepting them, her con|duct
<PB N="93" REF="031067_0092_0FEBDC5E162AE570">
would be repugnant to the tender in|jured memory of her murdered Lord. She would de&s;troy for ever the peace of her daughter, and the honour of her hou&s;e. To effect his deliverance by force of arms was utterly impracticable, &s;ince the Baron had declared, that "the moment of at|tack &s;hould be the moment of death to the Earl." Honour, humanity, parental ten|derne&s;s, bade her &s;ave her &s;on; yet, by a &s;trange contrariety of intere&s;ts, the &s;ame virtues pleaded with a voice equally power|ful, for the rever&s;e of the &s;entence, Hi|therto hope had &s;till illumined her mind with a di&s;tant ray; &s;he now found her&s;elf &s;uddenly involved in the darkne&s;s of de&s;|pair, who&s;e glooms were interrupted only by the gleams of horror which aro&s;e from the altar, on which was to be &s;acrificed one of her beloved children. Her mind &s;hrunk from the idea of uniting her daughter to the murderer of her father. The ferocious character of Malcolm was alone &s;ufficient to blight for ever the happine&s;s of the wo|man
<PB N="94" REF="031067_0093_0FEBDC70D71E9FF8">
man who&s;e fate &s;hould be connected with his. To give to the murderer the child of the murdered was a thought too horrid to re&s;t upon. The Counte&s;s rejected with force the Baron's offer of exchange, when the bleeding figure of her beloved &s;on, pale and convul&s;ed in death, &s;tarted on her imagination, and &s;tretched her brain al|mo&s;t to frenzy.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Mary &s;uffered a conflict e|qually dreadful. Nature had be&s;towed on her a heart &s;u&s;ceptible of all the fine emo|tions of delicate pa&s;&s;ion; a heart which vibrated in uni&s;on with the &s;weete&s;t feel|ings of humanity; a mind&punc; quick in per|ceiving the nice&s;t lines of moral rectitude, and &s;trenuous in endeavouring to act up to its perceptions. The&s;e gifts were unnece&s;|&s;ary to make her &s;en&s;ible of the wretched|ne&s;s of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation; of which a common mind would have felt the mi&s;ery; they &s;erved, however, to &s;harpen the points of affliction, encrea&s;e their force, and to
<PB N="95" REF="031067_0094_0FEBDC87882D0C50">
di&s;clo&s;e, in &s;tronger light, the various hor|rors of her &s;ituation. Fraternal love and pity called loudly upon her to re&s;ign her|&s;elf into the power of the man whom, from the earlie&s;t dawn of perception, &s;he had contemplated with trembling aver&s;ion and horror. The memory of her murdered parent, every feeling dear to virtue, the tremulous, but forceful voice of love a|wakened her heart, and each oppo&s;ed, with wild impetuo&s;ity, every other &s;entiment. Her &s;oul &s;hrunk back with terror from the idea of union with the Baron. Could &s;he bear to receive, in marriage, that hand which was &s;tained with the blood of her father?&mdash;The polluted touch would freeze her heart in horror!&mdash;could &s;he bear to pa&s;s her life with the man, who had for ever bla&s;ted the &s;miling days of him who gave her being?&mdash;With the man who would &s;tand before her eyes a perpetual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of mi&s;ery to her&s;elf, and of di&s;honour to her family? who&s;e chilling a&s;pect would repel every amiable and generous affection, and
<PB N="96" REF="031067_0095_0FEBDC997A197D48">
and &s;trike them back upon her heart only to wound it? To cheri&s;h the love of the noble virtues, would be to cheri&s;h the re|membrance of her dead father, and of her living lover. How wretched mu&s;t be her &s;ituation, when to obliterate from her me|mory the image of virtue, could alone af|ford her a chance of obtaining a horrid tranquillity; virtue which is &s;o dear to the human heart, that when her form for&s;akes us, we pur&s;ue her &s;hadow. Wherever in &s;earch of comfort &s;he directed her aching &s;ight, Mi&s;ery's haggard countenance ob|truded on her view. Here &s;he beheld her|&s;elf entombed in the arms of the murderer;&mdash;there, the &s;pectacle of her beloved bro|ther, encircled with chains, and awaiting the &s;troke of death, aro&s;e to her imagina|tion; the &s;cene was too affecting; fancy gave her the horrors of reality. The re|flection, that through her he &s;uffered, that &s;he yet might &s;ave him from de&s;truction, broke with irre&s;i&s;tible force upon her mind, and in&s;tantly bore away every oppo&s;ing
<PB N="97" REF="031067_0096_0FEBDCB340DFB970">
feeling. She re&s;olved, that &s;ince &s;he mu&s;t be wretched, &s;he would be nobly wretch|ed; &s;ince mi&s;ery demanded one &s;acrifice, &s;he would devote her&s;elf the victim.</P>
<P>With the&s;e thoughts, &s;he entered the a|partment of the Counte&s;s, who&s;e concur|rence was nece&s;&s;ary to ratify her re&s;olves, and, having declared them, awaited in trembling expectation her deci&s;ion. Ma|tilda had &s;uffered a di&s;traction of mind, which the nature of no former trial had oc|ca&s;ioned her. On the unfortunate death of a hu&s;band tenderly beloved, &s;he had &s;uf|fered all the &s;orrow which tenderne&s;s, and all the &s;hock which the manner of his death could occa&s;ion. The event, however, &s;hocking as it was, did not hang upon cir|cum&s;tances over which &s;he had an influ|ence; it was decided by an higher power;&mdash;it was decided, and never could be re|called; &s;he had there no dreadful choice of horrors, no evil ratified by her own voice, to taint with deadly recollections her de|clining
<PB N="98" REF="031067_0097_0FEA9D9272CF62A0">
days. This choice, though forced upon her by the power of a tyrant, &s;he would &s;till con&s;ider as in part her own; and the thought that &s;he was compelled to doom to de&s;truction one of her children, harrowed up her &s;oul almo&s;t to frenzy.</P>
<P>Her mind, at length exhau&s;ted with ex|ce&s;s of feeling, was now fallen into a &s;tate of cold and &s;ilent de&s;pair; &s;he became in|&s;en&s;ible to the objects around her, almo&s;t to the &s;en&s;e of her own &s;ufferings, and the voice, and the propo&s;al of her daughter, &s;carcely awakened her powers of percep|tion. "He &s;hall live," &s;aid Mary, in a voice broken and tender; "He &s;hall live I am ready to become the &s;acrifice." Tears prevented her proceeding. At the word "live," the Counte&s;s rai&s;ed her eyes, and threw round her a look of wildne&s;s, which &s;ettling on the features of Mary, &s;oftened into an expre&s;&s;ion of ineffable tenderne&s;s, &s;he waved her head, and turned to the window. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew tears bedewed her cheek;
<PB N="99" REF="031067_0098_0FEA9D04474269E8">
they fell like the drops of Heaven upon the withered plant, reviving and expand|ing its dying foliage; they were the fir&s;t her eyes had known &s;ince the fatal news had reached her. Recovering her&s;elf a little, &s;he &s;ent for Alleyn, who was &s;till in the ca&s;tle. She wi&s;hed to con&s;ult with him, whether there was not yet a po&s;&s;ibility of effecting the e&s;cape of the Earl. In afflic|tions of whatever degree, where death has not already fixed the events in certain|ty, the mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> almo&s;t beyond the &s;phere of po&s;&s;ibility in &s;earch of hope, and &s;eldom relinqui&s;hes the fond illu&s;ion till the &s;troke of reality di&s;&s;olves the enchant|ment. Thus it was with Matilda; after the grief produced by the fir&s;t &s;troke of this di&s;a&s;ter was &s;omewhat abated, &s;he was in|clined to think that her &s;ituation might not prove &s;o de&s;perate as &s;he imagined; and her heart was warmed by a remote hope, that there might yet be devi&s;ed &s;ome method of procuring the e&s;cape of the Earl. Alleyn came; he came in the trem|bling
<PB N="100" REF="031067_0099_0FEA9D98479B9DD8">
expectation of receiving the deci&s;ion of the Counte&s;s, and in the intention of of|fering to engage in any enterprize, howe|ver hazardous, for the enlargement of the Earl. He repelled, with in&s;tant force, every idea of Mary's becoming the wife of Malcolm; the thought was too full of ag|ony to be endured, and he threw the &s;en|&s;ation from his heart as a poi&s;on which would de&s;troy the pul&s;e of life. To pre|&s;erve Mary from a mi&s;ery &s;o exqui&s;ite, and to &s;ave the life of the Earl, he was willing to encounter any hazard; to meet death it&s;elf as an evil which appeared le&s;s dread|ful than either of the former. He came prepared with this re&s;olution, and it &s;erv|ed to &s;upport that fortitude which affliction had di&s;turbed, though it could not &s;ubdue. When he came again to the Counte&s;s, his di&s;tre&s;s was heightened by the &s;cene before him; he beheld her leaning on a &s;ofa, pale and &s;ilent; her uncon&s;cious eyes were fixed on an oppo&s;ite window; her counte|nance was touched with a wildne&s;s expre&s;|&s;ive
<PB N="101" REF="031067_0100_0FEA9D0840222248">
of the di&s;order of her mind, and &s;he remained for &s;ome time in&s;en&s;ible of his approach. Such is the fluctuation of a mind overcome by di&s;tre&s;s, that if for a moment a ray of hope chears its darkne&s;s, it vani&s;hes at the touch of recollection. Ma|ry was &s;tanding near the Counte&s;s, who&s;e hand &s;he held to her bo&s;om. Her pre&s;ent &s;orrow had heightened the natural pen&s;ive|ne&s;s of her countenance, and &s;haded her features with an intere&s;ting languor, more enchanting than the vivacity of blooming health; her eyes &s;ought to avoid Alleyn, as an object dangerous to the re&s;olution &s;he had formed. Matilda remained ab&s;orbed in thought. Mary wi&s;hed to repeat the purpo&s;e of her &s;oul, but her voice &s;tum|bled, and the half-formed &s;entence died a|way on her lips. Alleyn enquired the commands of the Counte&s;s. "I am rea|dy," &s;aid Mary, at length, in a low and tremulous voice, "to give my&s;elf the vic|tim to the Baron's revenge.&mdash;I will &s;ave my brother." At the&s;e words, the heart
<PB N="102" REF="031067_0101_0FEA9C47E65B3E90">
of Alleyn grew cold. Mary, overcome by the effort which they had occa&s;ioned her, &s;carcely fini&s;hed the &s;entence; her nerves &s;hook, a mi&s;t fell over her eye, and &s;he &s;unk on the &s;ofa by which &s;he had &s;tood. Alleyn hung over the couch in &s;ilent ago|ny, watching her return to life. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e about her, &s;he &s;oon re|vived. Alleyn, in the joy which he felt at her recovery, forgot for a moment his &s;ituation, and pre&s;&s;ed with ardor her hand to his bo&s;om. Mary, who&s;e &s;en&s;es were yet &s;carcely recollected, yielded uncon&s;ci|ou&s;ly to the &s;oftne&s;s of her heart, and be|trayed its &s;ituation by a &s;mile &s;o tender, as to thrill the brea&s;t of Alleyn with the &s;weet certainty of being lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. Hitherto his pa&s;&s;ion had been chilled by the de&s;pair which the va&s;t &s;uperiority of her birth oc|ca&s;ioned, and by the mode&s;ty which for|bade him to imagine that he had merit &s;uf|ficient to arre&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ye of the accompli&s;hed Mary. Perhaps, too, the diffidence natu|ral to genuine love, might contribute to

deceive him. It was not till this moment, that he experienced that certainty which a|wakened in his heart a &s;en&s;e of delight hi|therto unknown to him. For a moment he forgot the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the ca&s;tle, and his own &s;ituation; every idea faded from his mind, but the one he had &s;o lately ac|quired; and in that moment he &s;eemed to ta&s;te perfect felicity. Recollection, howe|ver, with all its train of black dependan|cies &s;oon returned, and plunged him in a mi&s;ery as poignant as the joy from which he was now precipitated.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was now &s;ufficiently com|po&s;ed to enter on the &s;ubject neare&s;t her heart. Alleyn caught, with eagerne&s;s, her mention of attempting the deliverance of the Earl, for the po&s;&s;ibility of accompli&s;h|ing which, he declared him&s;elf willing to encounter any danger: he &s;econded &s;o warmly the de&s;ign, and &s;poke with &s;uch flattering probability of &s;ucce&s;s, that the &s;pirits of Matilda began once more to re|vive;
<PB N="104" REF="031067_0103_0FEA9C4FA7A012D0">
yet &s;he trembled to encourage hopes which hung on &s;uch perilous uncertainty. It was agreed, that Alleyn &s;hould con&s;ult with the mo&s;t able and tru&s;ty of the clan, whom age or infirmity had detained from battle, on the means mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, and then proceed immediately on the expedition: having fir&s;t delivered to the Baron a me&s;&s;age from the Counte&s;s, requiring time for deliberation upon a choice &s;o important, and importing that an an&s;wer &s;hould be returned at the expi|ration of a fortnight.</P>
<P>Alleyn accordingly a&s;&s;embled tho&s;e whom he judged mo&s;t worthy of the coun|cil: various &s;chemes were propo&s;ed, none of which appeared likely to &s;ucceed; when it was recollected that the Earl might po&s;|&s;ibly have been removed from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ower to &s;ome new place of confinement, which it would be nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to di&s;cover, that the plan might be adapted to the &s;ituation.

<P>THE ca&s;tle of Dunbayne was &s;till the &s;cene of triumph, and of wretched|ne&s;s. Malcolm, exulting in his &s;cheme, already beheld Mary at his feet, and the Earl retiring in an angui&s;h more poignant than that of death. He was &s;urpri&s;ed that his invention had not before &s;upplied him with this means of torture: for the fir&s;t time he welcomed love, as the in&s;trument of his revenge; and the charms of Mary were heightened to his imagination by the ardent colours of this pa&s;&s;ion. He was confirmed in his re&s;olves, never to relin|qui&s;h the Earl, but on the conditions he had offered; and thus for ever would he pre&s;erve the hou&s;e of Athlin a monument of his triumph.</P>
<P>O&s;bert, for greater &s;ecurity, was conveyed from the tower into a more centrical part

of the ca&s;tle, to an apartment &s;pacious but gloomy, who&s;e gothic windows partly ex|cluding light, threw a &s;olemnity around, which chilled the heart almo&s;t to horror. He heeded not this; his heart was occu|pied with horrors of its own. He was now involved in a mi&s;ery more intricate, and more dreadful, than his imagination had yet painted. To die, was to him, who had &s;o long contemplated the near ap|proach of death, a familiar and tran&s;ient evil; but to &s;ee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in idea, his family involved in infamy, and in union with the murderer, was the &s;troke which pierced his heart to its center. He feared that the cruel tenderne&s;s of the mother would tempt Matilda to accept the offers of the Ba|ron; and he &s;carcely doubted, that the no|ble Mary would re&s;ign her&s;elf the price of his life. He would have written to the Coun|te&s;s to have forbidden her acceptance of the terms, and to have declared his fixed re&s;olution to die, but that he had no means of conveying to her a letter; the &s;oldier

<P>Alleyn had now joined the clan, and was ardent in pur&s;uit of the nece&s;&s;ary intel|ligence. He learned that the Earl had been removed from the tower, but in what part of the ca&s;tle he was now confined he could not di&s;cover; on this point all was vague conjecture. That he was alive, was only judged from the policy of the Ba|ron, who&s;e ardent pa&s;&s;ion for Mary was now well under&s;tood. Alleyn employed every &s;tratagem his invention could &s;ug|ge&s;t,

to di&s;cover the pri&s;on of the Earl, but without &s;ucce&s;s: at length compelled to deliver to Malcolm, the me&s;&s;age of the Counte&s;s, he demanded, as a preliminary, that the Earl &s;hould be &s;hewn to his people from the ramparts, that they might be certain he was &s;till alive. Alleyn hoped that his appearance would lead to a di&s;co|very of the place of his impri&s;onment, pur|po&s;ing to ob&s;erve narrowly the way by which he &s;hould retire.</P>
<P>The Earl appeared in &s;afety on the ram|parts, amid the &s;houts and acclamations of his people; the Baron, frowning defiance, was &s;een at his &s;ide.

&s;purn the ba&s;e compliance, as &s;he feared to &s;acrifice both her children to the murderer of their father. At the&s;e words, a &s;mile of haughty triumph marked the features of the Baron, and he turned from O&s;bert in &s;ilent exultation. The Earl was led off by the guards. Alleyn endeavoured in vain to mark the way they took; the lofty walls &s;oon concealed them from his view.</P>
<P>Alleyn now experienced how &s;trenu|ou&s;ly a vigorous mind protects its favou|rite hope; wayward circum&s;tances may &s;hock, di&s;appointment may check it; but it ri&s;es &s;uperior to oppo&s;ition, and traver&s;es the &s;phere of po&s;&s;ibility to accompli&s;h its purpo&s;e. Alleyn did not yet de&s;pair, but he was perplexed in what manner to pro|ceed.</P>
<P>In his way from the ramparts, O&s;bert was &s;urpri&s;ed by the appearance of two la|dies at a window near which he pa&s;&s;ed: the agitation of his mind did not prevent his

recognizing them as the &s;ame he had ob|&s;erved from the grates of the tower, with &s;uch lively admiration, and who had ex|cited in his mind &s;o much pity and curi|o&s;ity. In the mid&s;t of his di&s;tre&s;s, his thoughts had often dwelt on the &s;weet graces of the younger, and he had &s;ighed to obtain the &s;tory of her &s;orrows; for the melancholy which hung upon her features proclaimed her to be unfortunate. They now &s;tood ob&s;erving O&s;bert as he pa&s;&s;ed, and their eyes expre&s;&s;ed the pity which his &s;ituation in&s;pired. He gazed earne&s;tly and mournfully upon them, and when he en|tered his pri&s;on&punc; again enquired concern|ing them, but the &s;ame inflexible &s;ilence was pre&s;erved on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As the Earl &s;at one day mu&s;ing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pri&s;on, his eyes involuntarily fixed upon a pannel in the oppo&s;ite wain&s;cot;&mdash;he ob|&s;erved that it was differently formed from the re&s;t, and that its projection was &s;ome|what greater; a hope &s;tarted into his mind,
<PB N="112" REF="031067_0111_0FEA9C5CA5E8C9C8">
and he quitted his &s;eat to examine it. He perceived that it was &s;urrounded by a &s;mall crack, and on pu&s;hing it with his hands it &s;hook under them. Certain that it was &s;omething more than a pannel, he exerted all his &s;trength again&s;t it, but without pro|ducing any new effect. Having tried va|rious means to move it without &s;ucce&s;s, he gave up the experiment, and returned to his &s;eat melancholy and di&s;appointed. Se|veral days pa&s;&s;ed without any further no|tice being taken of the wain&s;cot; unwil|ling, however, to relinqui&s;h a la&s;t hope he returned to the examination, when, in endeavouring to remove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pannel, his foot accidentally hit again&s;t one corner; and it &s;uddenly flew open. It had been contrived that a &s;pring which was con|cealed within, and which fa&s;tened the par|tition, &s;hould receive its impul&s;e from the pre&s;&s;ure of a certain part of the pannel, which was now touched by the foot of the Earl. His joy on the di&s;covery cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. An apartment wide and for|lorn,
<PB N="113" REF="031067_0112_0FEA9D18CA4DEC98">
like that which formed his pri&s;on, now lay before him; the windows, which were high and arched, were decorated with painted gla&s;s; the floor was paved with marble; and it &s;eemed to be the de&s;erted remains of a place of wor&s;hip. O&s;bert tra|ver&s;ed, with he&s;itating &s;teps, its dreary length, towards a pair of folding doors, large and of oak, which clo&s;ed the apart|ment: the&s;e he opened; a gallery, gloo|my and va&s;t, appeared beyond; the win|dows, which were in the &s;ame &s;tyle of Go|thic architecture with the former, were &s;haded by thick ivy that almo&s;t excluded the light. O&s;bert &s;tood at the entrance, uncertain whether to proceed; he li&s;ten|ed, but heard no foot-&s;tep in his pri&s;on, and determined to go on. The gallery terminated on the left in a large winding &s;tair-ca&s;e, old and apparently neglected, which led to a hall below; on the right was a door, low, and rather ob&s;cure. O&s;|bert, apprehen&s;ive of di&s;covery, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tairca&s;e, and opened the door, when a &s;uite
<PB N="114" REF="031067_0113_0FEA9C64AD0D7E38">
of noble apartments, magnificently 'fur|ni&s;hed, was di&s;clo&s;ed to his wondering eyes. He proceeded onward without per|ceiving any per&s;on, but having pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd room, heard the faint &s;obs of a per|&s;on weeping; he &s;tood for a moment, un|determined whether to proceed: but an ir|re&s;i&s;tible curio&s;ity impelled him forward, and he entered an apartment, in which were &s;eated the beautiful &s;trangers, who&s;e appearance had &s;o much intere&s;ted his feel|ings. The elder of the ladies was di&s;&s;olv|ed in tears, and a ca&s;ket and &s;ome papers lay open on a table be&s;ide her. The youn|ger was &s;o intent upon a drawing, which &s;he &s;eemed to be fini&s;hing, as not to ob&s;erve the entrance of the Earl. The elder lady, on perceiving him, aro&s;e in &s;ome confu&s;ion, and the &s;urpri&s;e in her eyes &s;eemed to de|mand an explanation of &s;o unaccountable a vi&s;it. The Earl, &s;urpri&s;ed at what he be|held, &s;tepped back with an intention of re|tiring; but recollecting that the intru&s;ion demanded an apology, he returned. The
<PB N="115" REF="031067_0114_0FEA9D1C64403660">
grace with which he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, con|firmed the impre&s;&s;ion which his figure had already made on the mind of Laura, which was the name of the younger lady; who on looking up, di&s;covered a countenance in which dignity and &s;weetne&s;s were happi|ly blended. She appeared to be about twenty, her per&s;on was of the middle &s;ta|ture, extremely delicate, and very elegant|ly formed. The bloom of her youth was &s;haded by a &s;oft and pen&s;ive melancholy, which communicated an expre&s;&s;ion to her fine blue eyes, extremely intere&s;ting. Her features were partly concealed by the beau|tiful luxuriance of her auburn hair, which curling round her face, de&s;cended in tre&s;|&s;es on her bo&s;om; every feminine grace played around her; and the &s;imple digni|ty of her air declared the purity and the no|bility of her mind. On perceiving the Earl, a faint blu&s;h animated her cheek, and &s;he involuntarily quitted the drawing upon which &s;he had been engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="031067_0115_0FEA9C67958FCE50">
If the former imperfect view he had caught of Laura had given an impre&s;&s;ion to the heart of O&s;bert, it now received a &s;tronger character from the opportunity afforded him of contemplating her beauty. He concluded that the Baron, attracted by her charms, had entrapped her into his power, and detained her in the ca&s;tle an unwilling pri&s;oner. In this conjecture he was confirmed by the mournful ca&s;t of her countenance, and by the my&s;tery which appeared to &s;urround her. Fired by this idea, he melted in compa&s;&s;ion for her &s;uf|ferings; which compa&s;&s;ion was tinctured and encrea&s;ed by the pa&s;&s;ion which now glowed in his heart. At that moment he forgot the danger of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; he forgot even that he was a pri&s;oner; and awoke only to the wi&s;h of alleviating her &s;orrows, he rejected cold and u&s;ele&s;s deli|cacy, and re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to learn the cau&s;e of her misfortunes. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Barone&s;s, "if, Madam," &s;aid he, "I could by any means &s;often the
<PB N="117" REF="031067_0116_0FEA9D1E74CD6520">
affliction which I cannot affect not to per|ceive, and which has &s;o warmly intere&s;ted my feelings, I &s;hould regard this as one of the mo&s;t happy moments of my life; a life marked, alas! too &s;trongly with mi&s;ery! but mi&s;ery has not been u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince it has taught me &s;ympathy." The Barone&s;s was no &s;tranger to the character and the misfortunes of the Earl. Her&s;elf the vic|tim of oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;he knew how to commi|&s;erate the &s;ufferings of others. She had e|ver felt a tender compa&s;&s;ion for the misfor|tunes of O&s;bert, and did not now with|hold &s;incere expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ympathy, and of gratitude, for the intere&s;t which he felt in her &s;orrow. She expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing him thus at liberty; but ob&s;erv|ing the chains which encircled his hands, &s;he &s;huddered, and gue&s;&s;ed a part of the truth. He explained to her the di&s;covery of the pannel, by which circum&s;tance he had found his way into that apartment. The idea of aiding him to e&s;cape, ru&s;hed upon the mind of the Barone&s;s, but was
<PB N="118" REF="031067_0117_0FEA9C69276FEE98">
repre&s;&s;ed by the con&s;ideration of her own confined &s;ituation; and &s;he was compelled with mournful reluctance, to re&s;ign that thought which reverence for the character of the late Earl, and compa&s;&s;ion for the misfortunes of the pre&s;ent, had in&s;pired. She lamented her inability to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and informed him that her&s;elf and her daughter were alike pri&s;oners with him&s;elf; that the walls of the ca&s;tle were the limits of their liberty; and that they had &s;uffered the pre&s;&s;ure of tyranny for fifteen years. The Earl expre&s;&s;ed the indignation which he felt at this recital, and &s;olicited the Ba|rone&s;s to confide in his integrity; and, if the relation would not be too painful to her to honour him &s;o far as to acquaint him by what cruel means &s;he fell into the power of Malcolm. The Barone&s;s, apprehen&s;ive for his &s;afety, reminded him of the ri&s;k of di&s;covery by a longer ab&s;ence from his pri|&s;on; and, thanking him again for the in|tere&s;t he took in her &s;ufferings, a&s;&s;ured him of her warme&s;t wi&s;hes for his deliver|ance,
<PB N="119" REF="031067_0118_0FEA9D22AFBA3748">
and that if an opportunity ever of|fered, &s;he would acquaint him with the &s;ad particulars of her &s;tory. The eyes of O&s;bert made known that gratitude which it was difficult for his tongue to utter. Tre|mulou&s;ly he &s;olicited the con&s;olation of &s;ometimes re-vi&s;iting the apartments of the Barone&s;s; a permi&s;&s;ion which would give him &s;ome intervals of comfort amid the many hours of torment to which he was condemned. The Barone&s;s, in compa&s;|&s;ion to his &s;ufferings, granted the reque&s;t. The Earl departed, gazing on Laura with eyes of mournful tenderne&s;s; yet he was plea&s;ed with what had pa&s;&s;ed, and retired to his pri&s;on in one of tho&s;e peaceful inter|vals which are known even to the wretch|ed. He found all quiet, and clo&s;ing the pannel in &s;afety, &s;at down to con&s;ider the pa&s;t, and anticipate the future. He was flattered with hopes, that the di&s;covery of the pannel might aid him to e&s;cape; the glooms of de&s;pondence which had lately enveloped his mind, gradually di&s;appear|ed,
<PB N="120" REF="031067_0119_0FEA9C710043A850">
and joy once more illumined his pro&s;|pects; but it was the &s;un&s;hine of an April morn, deceitful and momentary. He re|collected that the ca&s;tle was be&s;et with guards, who&s;e vigilance was in&s;ured by the &s;everity of the Baron; he remembered that the &s;trangers, who had taken &s;o kind an intere&s;t in his fate, were pri&s;oners like him&s;elf; and that he had no generous &s;ol|dier to teach him the &s;ecret windings of the ca&s;tle, and to accompany him in flight. His imagination was haunted by the image of Laura; vainly he &s;trove to di&s;gui&s;e from him&s;elf the truth; his heart con&s;tantly be|lied the &s;ophi&s;try of his rea&s;onings. Un|warily he had drank the draught of love, and he was compelled to acknowledge the fatal indi&s;cretion. He could not, howe|ver, re&s;olve to throw from his heart the delicious poi&s;on; he could not re&s;olve to &s;ee her no more. The painful apprehen|&s;ion for his &s;afety, which his forbearing to renew the vi&s;it he had &s;o earne&s;tly &s;olicit|ed, would occa&s;ion the Barone&s;s; the ap|parent

di&s;re&s;pect it would convey; the ar|dent curio&s;ity with which he longed to ob|tain the hi&s;tory of her misfortunes; the lively intere&s;t he felt in learning the &s;itua|tion of Laura, with re&s;pect to the Baron: and the hope,&mdash;the wild hope, with which he deluded his rea&s;on, that he might be a|ble to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, determined him to re|peat the vi&s;it. Under the&s;e illu&s;ions, the motive which principally impelled him to the interview was concealed.</P>
<P>In the mean time Alleyn had returned to the ca&s;tle of Athlin with the re&s;olutions of the Earl; who&s;e re&s;olves &s;erved only to aggravate the di&s;tre&s;s of its fair inhabi|tants. Alleyn, however, unwilling to cru&s;h a la&s;t hope, tenderly&punc; concealed from them the circum&s;tance of the Earl's remo|val from the tower; &s;ilently and almo&s;t hopele&s;sly meditating to di&s;cover his pri|&s;on; and admini&s;tered that comfort to the Counte&s;s and to Mary, which his own ex|pectation would not &s;uffer him to partici|pate.
<PB N="122" REF="031067_0121_0FEA9C72943752D0">
He retired in ha&s;te to the veterans whom he had before a&s;&s;embled, and ac|quainted them with the removal of the Earl; which circum&s;tance mu&s;t for the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pend their con&s;ultations. He left them, therefore, and in&s;tantly return|ed to the clan: there to pro&s;ecute his en|quiries. Every po&s;&s;ible exertion was made to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary intelligence, but without &s;ucce&s;s. The moment in which the Baron would demand the an&s;wer of the Counte&s;s, was now fa&s;t approaching, and every heart &s;unk in de&s;pair, when one night the centinels of the camp were alarm|ed by the approach of men, who hailed them in unknown voices; fearful of &s;ur|pri&s;e, they &s;urrounded the &s;trangers, and led them to Alleyn; to whom they related, that they fled from the capricious tyranny of Malcolm, and &s;ought refuge in the camp of his enemy; who&s;e misfortunes they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and in who&s;e cau&s;e they enli&s;ted. Rejoiced at the circum&s;tance, yet doubtful of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Alleyn interrogated the &s;oldi|ers
<PB N="123" REF="031067_0122_0FEA9D28868933D8">
concerning the pri&s;on of the Earl. From them he learned, that O&s;bert was confined in a part of the ca&s;tle extremely difficult of acce&s;s; and that any plan of e|&s;cape mu&s;t be utterly impracticable without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one well acquainted with the various intricacies of the pile. An op|portunity of &s;ucce&s;s was now pre&s;ented, with which the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of Al|leyn had never flattered him. He receiv|ed from the &s;oldiers &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; from them, likewi&s;e, he learn|ed, that di&s;content reigned among the people of the Baron; who, impatient of the yoke of tyranny, only waited a favour|able opportunity to throw it off, and re&s;ume the rights of nature. That the vigilant &s;u&s;picions of Malcolm excited him to pun|i&s;h with the har&s;he&s;t &s;everity every appear|ance of inattention; that being condemn|ed to &s;uffer a very heavy puni&s;hment for a &s;light offence, they had eluded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> im|pending mi&s;ery, and the future oppre&s;&s;ion of their Chief, by de&s;ertion.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="031067_0123_0FEA9C7434AE5FB8">
Alleyn immediately convened a council, before whom the &s;oldiers were brought; they repeated their former a&s;&s;ertions; and one of the fugitives added, that he had a brother, who&s;e place of guard over the per|&s;on of the Earl on that night, had made it difficult to elude ob&s;ervation, and had pre|vented his e&s;caping with them; that on the night of the morrow he &s;tood guard at the gate of the le&s;&s;er draw-bridge, where the centinels were few; that he was him|&s;elf willing to ri&s;que the danger of conver|&s;ing with him; and had little doubt of gaining him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the deliverance of the Earl. At the&s;e words, the heart of Alleyn throbbed with joy. He promi&s;ed large rewards to the brave &s;oldier and to his brother, if they undertook the enter|prize. His companion was well acquaint|ed with the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages of the rock, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf de&s;irous of be|ing u&s;eful. The hopes of Alleyn every in|&s;tant grew &s;tronger; and he vainly wi&s;h|ed, at that moment, to communicate to the

Earl's unhappy family the joy which dilat|ed his heart.</P>
<P>The eve of the following day was fixed upon to commence their de&s;igns; when James &s;hould endeavour to gain his bro|ther to their purpo&s;e. Having adju&s;ted the&s;e matters, they retired to re&s;t for the remainder of the night; but &s;leep had fled the eyes of Alleyn; anxious expectation filled his mind; and he &s;aw, in the wak|ing vi&s;ions of fancy, the meeting of the Earl with his family: he anticipated the thanks he &s;hould receive from the lovely Mary; and he &s;ighed at the recollection, that thanks were all for which he could e|ver dare to hope.</P>
<P>At length the dawn appeared, and wak|ed the clan to hopes and pro&s;pects far diffe|rent from tho&s;e of the preceding morn. The hours hung heavily on the expectation of Alleyn, who&s;e mind was filled with &s;o|licitude for the event of the meeting be|tween
<PB N="126" REF="031067_0125_0FEA9C78A0353958">
the brothers. Night at length came to his wi&s;hes. The darkne&s;s was interrupt|ed only by the faint light of the moon moving through the watery and broken clouds, which enveloped the horizon. Tumultuous gu&s;ts of wind broke at inter|vals the &s;ilence of the hour. Alleyn watch|ed the movements of the ca&s;tle; he ob&s;erv|ed the lights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively di&s;appear. The bell from the watch-tower chimed one; all was &s;till within the walls; and James ven|tured forth to the draw-bridge. The draw-bridge divided in the center, and the half next the plains was down; he mounted it, and in a low yet firm voice, called on Ed|mund. No an&s;wer was returned; and he began to fear that his brother had already quitted the ca&s;tle. He remained &s;ome time in &s;ilent &s;u&s;pen&s;e before he repeated the call, when he heard the gate of the draw-bridge gently unbarred, and Edmund ap|peared. He was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee James and bade him in&s;tantly fly the danger that &s;urrounded him. The Baron, incen&s;ed at
<PB N="127" REF="031067_0126_0FEA9D2D722FCB28">
the frequent de&s;ertion of his &s;oldiers, had &s;ent out people in pur&s;uit, and had promi&s;|ed con&s;iderable rewards for the apprehen|&s;ion of the fugitives. James, undaunted by what he heard, kept his ground, re&s;ol|ved to urge his purpo&s;e to the point. Hap|pily the centinels who &s;tood guard with Edmund, overcome with the effect of a potion he had admini&s;tered to favour his e&s;cape, were &s;unk in &s;leep, and the &s;oldi|ers conducted their di&s;cour&s;e in a low voice without interuption.</P>
<P>Edmund was unwilling to defer his flight, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not re&s;olution &s;ufficient to en|counter the hazard of the enterpri&s;e, till the proffered reward con&s;oled his &s;elf deni|al, and rou&s;ed his &s;lumbering courage. He was well acquainted with the &s;ubterraneous avenues of the ca&s;tle; the only remaining difficulty, was that of deceiving the vigi|lance of his fellow-centinels, who&s;e watch|fulne&s;s made it impo&s;&s;ible for the Earl to quit his &punc;pri&s;on unperceived. The &s;oldiers
<PB N="128" REF="031067_0127_0FEA9C7D9265FDD0">
who were to mount guard with him on the following night, were &s;tationed in a di&s;t|ant part of the ca&s;tle, till the hour of their removal to the door of the pri&s;on; it was, therefore, difficult to admini&s;ter to them that draught which had &s;teeped in forget|fulne&s;s the &s;en&s;es of his pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ociates. To confide to their integrity, and endea|vour to win them to his purpo&s;e, was cer|tainly to give his life into their hands, and probably to aggravate the di&s;a&s;trous fate of the Earl. This &s;cheme was be&s;et too thick with dangers to be hazarded, and their invention could furni&s;h them with none more promi&s;ing. It was, however, a|greed, that on the following night, Ed|mund &s;hould &s;eize the moment of opportu|nity to impart to the Earl the de&s;igns of his friends, and to con&s;ult on the means of accompli&s;hing them. Thus concluding, James returned in &s;afety to the tent of Al|leyn, where the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the clan were a&s;&s;embled, there awaiting with impatient &s;olicitude, his arrival. The hopes

of Alleyn were &s;omewhat chilled by the re|port of the &s;oldier; from the vigilance which be&s;et the doors of the pri&s;on, e&s;cape from thence appeared impracticable. He was condemned, however, to linger, in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e till the third night from the pre&s;ent, when the return of Edmund to his &s;tation at the bridge would enable him again to commune with his brother. But Alleyn was un&s;u&s;picious of a circum&s;tance which would utterly have defeated his hopes, and who&s;e con&s;equence threatened de&s;truction to all their &s;chemes. A centinel on duty upon that part of the rampart which &s;ur|mounted the draw-bridge, had been a|larmed by hearing the gate unbar, and ap|proaching the wall, had perceived a man &s;tanding on the half of the bridge which was dropped, and in conver&s;e with &s;ome per&s;on on the ca&s;tle walls. He drew as near as the wall would permit, and endeavour|ed to li&s;ten to their di&s;cour&s;e. The gloom of night prevented his recognizing the per|&s;on on the bridge; but he could clearly

di&s;tingui&s;h the voice of Edmund in that of the man who was addre&s;&s;ed. Excited by new wonder, he gave all his attention to di&s;cover the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation. The di&s;tance occa&s;ioned between the bro|thers by the &s;u&s;pended half of the bridge, obliged them to &s;peak in a &s;omewhat high|er tone than they would otherwi&s;e have done; and the centinel gathered &s;ufficient from their di&s;cour&s;e, to learn that they were concerting the re&s;cue of the Earl; that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of Edmund's watch at the pri&s;on was to be the night of enterpri&s;e; and that &s;ome friends of the Earl were to await him in the environs of the ca&s;tle.

<P>On the following evening the Earl, yield|ing to the impul&s;e of his heart, once more unclo&s;ed his partition, and &s;ought the a|partments of the Barone&s;s. She received him with expre&s;&s;ions of &s;atisfaction; while

<P>LOUISA&punc; Barone&s;s Malcolm, was the de&s;cendant of an ancient and ho|nourable hou&s;e in Switzerland. Her father, the Marquis de St. Clair, in|herited all tho&s;e brave qualities, and that &s;tern virtue, which had &s;o eminently di&s;|tingui&s;hed his ance&s;tors. Early in life he lo&s;t a wife whom he tenderly loved, and he &s;eemed to derive his &s;ole con&s;olation from the education of the dear children &s;he had left behind. His &s;on, whom he had brought up to the arms him&s;elf &s;o honourably bore, fell before he reached his nineteenth year, in the &s;ervice of his country; an elder daughter died in infancy; Loui&s;a was his &s;ole &s;urviving child. His chateau was &s;i|tuated in one of tho&s;e delightful vallies of the Swi&s;s cantons, in which the beautiful and the &s;ublime are &s;o happily united;
<PB N="133" REF="031067_0132_0FEA9D942BCB9BE0">
where the magnificent features of the &s;ce|nery are contra&s;ted, and their effect height|ened by the blooming luxuriance of woods and pa&s;turage, by the gentle windings of the &s;tream, and the peaceful a&s;pect of the cottage. The Marquis was now retired from the &s;ervice, for grey age had over|taken him. His re&s;idence was the re&s;ort of foreigners of di&s;tinction, who, attracted by the united talents of the &s;oldier and the philo&s;opher, under his roof partook of the ho&s;pitality &s;o characteri&s;tic of his country. Among the vi&s;itors of this de&s;cription was the late Baron Malcolm, brother to the pre&s;ent Chief, who then travelled through Switzerland. The beauty of Loui&s;a, em|belli&s;hed by the elegance of a mind highly cultivated, touched his heart, and he &s;olicited her hand in marriage. The manly &s;en&s;e of the Baron, and the excel|lencies of his di&s;po&s;ition, had not pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved, or unapproved by the Mar|quis; while the graces of his per&s;on, and of his mind, had anticipated for him, in
<PB N="134" REF="031067_0133_0FEA9C8A7414FE18">
the heart of Loui&s;a, a pre-eminence over e|very other &s;uitor. The Marquis had but one objection to the marriage; this was likewi&s;e the objection of Loui&s;a: neither the one nor the other could endure the i|dea of the di&s;tance which was to &s;eparate them. Loui&s;a was to the Marquis the la&s;t prop of his declining years; the Marquis was to Loui&s;a the father and the friend to whom her heart had hitherto been &s;olely devoted, and from whom it could not now be torn but with an angui&s;h equal to its at|tachment. This remained an in&s;urmount|able ob&s;tacle, till it was removed by the tenderne&s;s of the Baron, who entreated the Marquis to quit Switzerland, and re|&s;ide with his daughter in Scotland. The attachment of the Marquis to his natal land, and the pride of hereditary domi|nion, was too powerful to &s;uffer him to acquie&s;ce in the propo&s;al without much &s;truggle of contending feelings. The de&s;ire of &s;ecuring the happine&s;s of his child, by a union with a character &s;o excellent as
<PB N="135" REF="031067_0134_0FEA9D386C73CA90">
the Baron's, and of &s;eeing her &s;ettle before death &s;hould deprive her of the protection of a father, at length &s;ubdued every other con&s;ideration, and he re&s;igned the hand of his daughter to the Baron Malcolm. The Marquis adju&s;ted his affairs, and con|&s;igning his e&s;tates to the care of tru&s;ty agents, bade a la&s;t adieu to his beloved country; that country which, during &s;ixty years, had been the principal &s;cene of his happine&s;s, and of his regrets. The cour&s;e of years had not obliterated from his heart the early affections of his youth: he took a &s;ad farewell of that grave which enclo&s;ed the reliques of his wife, from which it was not his lea&s;t effort to depart, and whither he ordered that his remains &s;hould be con|veyed. Loui&s;a quitted Switzerland with a concern &s;carcely le&s;s acute than that of her father; the poignancy of which, how|ever, was greatly &s;oftened by the tender a&s;&s;iduities of her Lord, who&s;e affectionate attentions hourly heightened her e&s;teem, and encrea&s;ed her love.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="031067_0135_0FEA9C8CC35DA220">
They arrived at Scotland without any ac|cident, where the Baron welcomed Loui&s;a as the mi&s;tre&s;s of his domains. The Mar|quis de St. Clair had apartments in the ca&s;tle, where the evening of his days declin|ed in peaceful happine&s;s. Before his death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his race renewed in the children of the Barone&s;s, in a &s;on who was called by the name of the Marquis, and in a daughter who now &s;hared with her mother the &s;orrows of con|finement. On the death of the Marquis it was nece&s;&s;ary for the Baron to vi&s;it Swit|zerland, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tates, and to adju&s;t &s;ome affairs which a long ab&s;ence had deranged. He attended the remains of the Marquis to their la&s;t a|bode. The Barone&s;s, de&s;irous of once once more beholding her native country, and anxious to pay a la&s;t re&s;pect to the memory of her father, entru&s;ted her chil|dren to the care of a faithful old &s;ervant, whom &s;he had brought with her from the Vallois, and who had been the nur&s;e of the
<PB N="137" REF="031067_0136_0FEA9D9FA99F9FD8">
of other early childhood, and accompanied the Baron to the continent. Having depo|&s;ited the remains of the Marquis according to his wi&s;h in the tomb of his wife, and ar|ranged their affairs, they returned to Scot|land, where the fir&s;t intelligence they re|ceived on their arrival at the ca&s;tle, was of the death of their &s;on, and of the old nur&s;e his attendant. The &s;ervant had died &s;oon after their departure; the child only a fortnight before their return. This di&s;a&s;|trous event affected equally the Baron and his lady, who never cea&s;ed to condemn her&s;elf for having entru&s;ted her &s;on to the care of &s;ervants. Time, however, &s;ubdu|ed the poignancy of this affliction, but came fraught with another yet more acute; this was the death of the Baron who, in the pride of youth, con&s;tituting the felicity of his family, and of his people, was killed by a fall from his hor&s;e, which he received in hunting. He left the Barone&s;s and an on|ly daughter to bewail with uncea&s;ing &s;or|row his lo&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="031067_0137_0FEA9C9CA5B35248">
The paternal e&s;tates devolved of cour&s;e to his only brother, the pre&s;ent Baron who&s;e character formed a mournful and &s;triking contra&s;t to that of the decea&s;ed Lord. All his per&s;onal property, which was con&s;iderable, with the e&s;tates in Swit|zerland, he bequeathed to his beloved wife and daughter. The new Baron, immedi|ately on the demi&s;e of his brother, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle, but allowed the Ba|rone&s;s with a part of her &s;uit, to remain its inhabitant till the expiration of the year. The Barone&s;s, ab&s;orbed in grief, &s;till loved to recall, in the &s;cene of her late felicity, the image of her Lord, and to linger in his former haunts. This motive, together with the nece&s;&s;ity of preparation for a jour|ney to Switzerland, induced her to accept the offer of the Baron.</P>
<P>The memory of his brother had quickly faded from the mind of Malcolm, who&s;e attention appeared to be wholly occupied by &s;chemes of avarice and ambition. His
<PB N="139" REF="031067_0138_0FEA9D3DAA635D38">
arrogance, and boundle&s;s love of power, embroiled him with the neighbouring Chiefs, and engaged him in continual ho&s;ti|lity. He &s;eldom vi&s;ited the Barone&s;s; when he did, his manner was cold, and even haughty. The Barone&s;s, &s;hocked to re|ceive &s;uch treatment from the brother of her decea&s;ed Lord, and reduced to feel her&s;elf an unwelcome gue&s;t in that ca&s;tle which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider as her own, determined to &s;et off for the continent immediately, and &s;eek, in the &s;olitudes of her native mountains, an a&s;y|lum from the frown of in&s;ulting power. The contra&s;t of character between the bro|thers drew many a &s;igh of bitter recollec|tion from her heart, and added weight to the &s;orrows which already oppre&s;&s;ed it. She gave orders, therefore, to her dome&s;|tics, to prepare for immediate departure; but was &s;oon after told that the Baron had forbad them to obey the command. A&s;to|ni&s;hed at this circum&s;tance, &s;he had not time to demand an explanation, ere a me&s;|&s;age
<PB N="140" REF="031067_0139_0FEA9C9E34CBB388">
from Malcolm required a few mo|ments private conver&s;ation. The me&s;&s;en|ger was followed almo&s;t in&s;tantly by the Baron, who entered the apartment with hurried &s;teps, his countenance over&s;pread with the dark purpo&s;es of his &s;oul. "I come, Madam," &s;aid he, in a voice &s;tern and determined, "to inform you, that you quit not this ca&s;tle. The e&s;tates which you call yours, are mine; and think not that I &s;hall neglect to pro&s;ecute my claim. The frequent and ill-timed genero&s;ities of my brother, have dimini&s;hed the value of the lands which are mine by inheritance; and I have therefore an indi&s;pen&s;able right to repay my&s;elf from tho&s;e e&s;tates which he acquired with you. In point of ju&s;tice, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the right of devi&s;ing the&s;e e&s;|tates, and I &s;hall not &s;uffer my&s;elf to be de|ceived by the eva&s;ions of the law; re&s;ign, therefore, the will, which remains only a record of unju&s;t wi&s;hes, and ineffectual claims. When the receipts from your e&s;|tates have &s;atisfied my demands, they &s;hall

again be yours. The apartments you now inhabit &s;hall remain your own; but be|yond the wall of this ca&s;tle you &s;hall not pa&s;s; for I will not, by &s;uffering your de|parture, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ord you an opportunity of con|te&s;ting tho&s;e rights which I can enforce without oppo&s;ition."</P>
<P>Overcome with a&s;toni&s;hment and dread, the Barone&s;s was for &s;ome time deprived of all power of reply. At length rou&s;ed by the &s;pirit of indignation; "I am too well informed, my Lord," &s;aid &s;he, "of my ju&s;t claims to the lands in que&s;tion; and know al&s;o too well the value of that integ|rity which is now no more, to credit your bold a&s;&s;ertions; they &s;erve only to unveil to me the darkne&s;s of a character, cruel and rapacious; who&s;e boundle&s;s avarice, trampling on the barriers of ju&s;tice and hu|manity, &s;eizes on the right of the defence|le&s;s widow, and on the portion of the un|re&s;i&s;ting orphan. This, my Lord, you are permitted to do; they have no means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

re&s;i&s;tance; but think not to impo&s;e on me by a &s;ophi&s;tical a&s;&s;ertion of right, or to glo&s;s the villany of your conduct with the colours of ju&s;tice; the artifice is beneath the de&s;perate force of your character, and is not &s;ufficiently &s;pecious to deceive the di&s;cernment of virtue. From being your pri&s;oner I have no means of e&s;caping; but never, my Lord, will I re&s;ign into your hands that will which is the efficient bond of my rights, and the la&s;t &s;ad record of the affection of my departed Lord." Grief clo&s;ed her lips. The Baron denouncing vengeance on her re&s;i&s;tance, his features inflamed with rage, quitted the apartment. The Barone&s;s was left to lament, with deep|ening angui&s;h, the &s;troke which had de|prived her of a beloved hu&s;band; and re|flection gave her the wretchedne&s;s of her &s;ituation in yet more lively colours. She was now a &s;tranger in a foreign land, de|prived by him, of whom &s;he had a right to demand protection, of all her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pri&s;oner in his ca&s;tle, without one friend
<PB N="143" REF="031067_0142_0FEA9D4111D1E7A8">
to vindicate her cau&s;e, and far remote from any means of appeal to the laws of the country. She wept over the youthful Lau|ra, and while &s;he pre&s;&s;ed her with mourn|ful fondne&s;s to her bo&s;om, &s;he was confirm|ed in her re&s;olution never to relinqui&s;h that will, by which alone the rights of her in|jured child could ever be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The Baron, bold in iniquity, obtained, by forged powers, the revenues of the fo|reign e&s;tates, and by this means, effectual|ly kept the Barone&s;s in his power, and de|prived her of her la&s;t re&s;ource. Secure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tates, and of the Ba|rone&s;s, he no longer regarded the will as an object of importance; and as &s;he did not attempt any means of e&s;cape, or the recovery of her rights, he &s;uffered her to remain undi&s;turbed, and in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the will.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s now pa&s;&s;ed her days in unvaried &s;orrow, except in tho&s;e intervals
<PB N="144" REF="031067_0143_0FEA9CA53AB1C990">
when &s;he forced her mind from its melan|choly &s;ubject, and devoted her&s;elf to the education of her daughter. The artle&s;s ef|forts of Laura, to a&s;&s;uage the &s;orrows of her mother, only fixed them in her heart in deeper impre&s;&s;ion, &s;ince they gave to her mind, in &s;tronger tints, the cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion to which her tender years were condemned. The progre&s;s which &s;he made in mu&s;ic and drawing, and in the lighter &s;ubjects of literature, while it plea&s;|ed the Barone&s;s, who was her &s;ole in&s;truc|tre&s;s, brought with it the bitter apprehen|&s;ion, that the&s;e accompli&s;hments, would probably be buried in the ob&s;curity of a pri&s;on; &s;till, however, they were not u&s;e|le&s;s, &s;ince they &s;erved at pre&s;ent to cheat affliction of many a weary moment, and would in future delude the melancholy hours of &s;olitude. Laura was particularly fond of the lute, which &s;he touched with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and who&s;e tender notes were &s;o &s;weetly in uni&s;on with the chords of &s;orrow, and with tho&s;e plaintive

<P>Malcolm, &s;tung with a &s;en&s;e of guilt, a|voided the pre&s;ence of his injured captive, and &s;ought an a&s;ylum from con&s;cience in the bu&s;y &s;cenes of war.</P>
<P>Eighteen years had now elap&s;ed &s;ince the death of the Baron, and the confinement of Loui&s;a. Time had blunted the point of affliction, though it &s;till retained its ve|nom; but &s;he &s;eldom dared to hope for that which for eighteen years had been witheld. She derived her only con&s;ola|tion from the improvement and the tender &s;ympathy of her daughter, who endeavour|ed, by every &s;oothing attention, to allevi|ate the &s;orrows of her parent.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="031067_0145_0FEA9CAD576161D0">
It was at this period that the Barone&s;s communicated to the Earl the &s;tory of her calamities.</P>
<P>The Earl li&s;tened with deep attention to the recital. His &s;oul burned with indig|nation again&s;t the Baron, while his heart gave to the &s;ufferings of the fair mourners all that &s;ympathy could a&s;k. Yet he was relieved from a very painful &s;en&s;ation, when he learned that the beauty of Laura had not influenced the conduct of the Baron. Her oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation &s;truck upon his heart the fine&s;t touch of pity; and the pa&s;&s;ion which her beauty and her &s;implicity had in&s;pired, was &s;trengthened and meliorated by her misfortunes. The fate of his father and the idea of his own injuries, ru&s;hed upon his mind; and, combining with the &s;ufferings of the victims now before him, rou&s;ed in his &s;oul a &s;torm of indignation, little inferior to that he had &s;uffered in his fir&s;t interview with the Baron. Every con|&s;ideration &s;unk before the impul&s;e of a ju&s;t

revenge; his mind, occupied with the hateful image of the murderer was harden|ed again&s;t danger, and in the fir&s;t energies of his re&s;entment he would have ru&s;hed to the apartment of Malcolm, and &s;triking the &s;word of ju&s;tice in his heart, have de|livered the earth from a mon&s;ter, and have re&s;igned him&s;elf the willing &s;acrifice of the action. "Shall the mon&s;ter live?" cried he, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat. His &s;tep was hur|ried, and his countenance was &s;tamped with a &s;tern virtue. The Barone&s;s was alarmed and following him to the door of her a|partment, which he had half opened, con|jured him to pau&s;e for a moment on the dangers that &s;urrounded him. The voice of rea&s;on, in the accents of the Barone&s;s, interrupted the hurried tumult of his &s;oul&punc; the illu&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion di&s;appeared; he re|collected that he was ignorant of the apart|ment of the Baron, and that he had no weapon to a&s;&s;i&s;t his purpo&s;e; and he found him&s;elf as a traveller on enchanted ground, when the wand of the magician &s;uddenly di&s;|&s;olves

<P>The Earl returned to his &s;eat hopele&s;s and dejected, and lo&s;t to every thing but to the bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointment. He forgot where he was, and the latene&s;s of the hour, till reminded by the Barone&s;s of the dangers of a longer &s;tay, when he mournfully bade her good night; and ad|vancing to Laura with timid re&s;pect, pre&s;|&s;ed her hand tenderly to his lips, and re|tired to his pri&s;on.</P>

<P>HE had now opened the partion, and was entering the room, when, by the faint gleam which the fire threw acro&s;s the apartment, he perceived indi&s;tinctly the figure of a man, and in the &s;ame in&s;tant heard the &s;ound of approaching armour. Surpri&s;e and horror thrilled through every nerve: he remained fixed to the &s;pot, and for &s;ome moments he&s;itated whether to re|tire.

The low

"Speak! what wretch art thou?" cried O&s;bert, when a &s;udden blaze of light from the &s;ire di&s;covered to him a &s;oldier of the Baron.

It was Edmund who had entered the pri&s;on under pretence of carrying fuel to the fire, but &s;ecretly for the purpo&s;e of conferring with O&s;bert.

imagined, when he learned the &s;chemes that were planning for his deliverance. The circum&s;tance which had nearly defeated the warm hopes of his friends, was by him di&s;regarded, &s;ince the knowledge of the &s;e|cret door opened to him, with the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of a guide through the intricacies of the ca&s;tle, a certain means of e&s;cape. Ed|mund was well acquainted with all the&s;e. The Earl told him of the di&s;covery of the fal&s;e pannel; bade him return to Alleyn with the joyful intelligence, and on his next night of watch prepare to aid him in e&s;cape. Edmund knew well the apartments which O&s;bert de&s;cribed, and the great &s;tair|ca&s;e which led into a part of the ca&s;tle that had long been totally for&s;aken, and from whence it was ea&s;y to pa&s;s unob&s;erved into the vaults which communicated with the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages in the rock.</P>
<P>Alleyn heard the report of James with a warm and generous joy, which impelled him to ha&s;ten immediately to the ca&s;tle of
<PB N="152" REF="031067_0151_0FEA9CB94C8F87C8">
Athlin, and di&s;pel the &s;orrows that inha|bited there; but the con&s;ideration that his &s;udden ab&s;ence from the camp might create &s;u&s;picion, and invite di&s;covery, checked the impul&s;e; and he yielded with reluc|tance to the nece&s;&s;ity which condemned the Counte&s;s and Mary to the horrors of a lengthened &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, meanwhile, who&s;e de|&s;igns, &s;trengthened by the &s;teady determi|nation of Mary, were un&s;haken by the me&s;&s;age of the Earl, which &s;he con&s;idered as only the effect of a momentary impul&s;e, watched the gradual departure of tho&s;e days which led to that which enveloped the fate of her children, with agony and faint|ing hope. She received no news from the camp; no words of comfort from Alleyn; and &s;he &s;aw the confidence which had nou|ri&s;hed her exi&s;tence &s;lowly &s;inking in de&s;|pair. Mary &s;ought to admini&s;ter that comfort to the afflictions of her mother, which her own equally demanded; &s;he

But &s;he &s;edulou&s;ly &s;ought to exclude Alleyn from her mind; his di&s;in|tere&s;ted and noble conduct excited emo|tions dangerous to her fortitude, and which rendered yet more poignant the tortures of the approaching &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Anxious to inform the Barone&s;s of his approaching deliverance, to a&s;&s;ure her of his be&s;t &s;ervices, to bid adieu to Laura, and to &s;eize the la&s;t opportunity he might ever po&s;&s;e&s;s of di&s;clo&s;ing to her his admi|ration and his love, the Earl revi&s;ited the apartments of the Barone&s;s.

<PB N="154" REF="031067_0153_0FEA9CBAE13E1608">
that of which her heart &s;oon reminded her&mdash;that O&s;bert was leaving the place of her confinement, and that &s;he &s;hould pro|bably &s;ee him no more. This thought ca&s;t a &s;udden &s;hade over her features, and from the enlivening expre&s;&s;ion of joy, they re|&s;umed their wonted melancholy. O&s;bert marked the momentary change, and his heart &s;poke to him the occa&s;ion. "My cup of joy is da&s;hed with bitterne&s;s," &s;aid he, "for amid the happine&s;s of approach|ing deliverance, I quit not my pri&s;on with|out &s;ome pangs of keen regret;&mdash;pangs which it were probably u&s;ele&s;s to make known, yet which my feelings will not &s;uf|fer me at this moment to conceal. With|in the&s;e walls, from whence I fly with ea|gerne&s;s, I leave a heart fraught with the mo&s;t tender pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;a heart which, while it beats with life, mu&s;t ever unite the image of Laura with the fondne&s;s of love. Could I hope that &s;he were not in|&s;en&s;ible to my attachment I &s;hould depart in peace, and would defy the ob&s;tacles

which bid me de&s;pair. Were I even cer|tain that &s;he would repel my love with cold indifference, I would yet, if &s;he accept my &s;ervices, effect her re&s;cue, or give my life the forfeiture." Laura was &s;ilent; &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak her, gratitude, yet feared to tell her love; but the &s;oft timidity of her eye, and the tender glow of her cheek revealed the &s;ecret that trembled on her lips. The Barone&s;s ob&s;erved her confu|&s;ion, and thanking the Earl for the no|ble &s;ervice he offered, declined accepting it. She be&s;ought him to involve no fur|ther the peace of his family and of him&s;elf, by attempting an enterpri&s;e &s;o crowded with dangers, and which might probably co&s;t him his life. The arguments of the Barone&s;s fell forcele&s;s when oppo&s;ed to the feelings of the Earl; &s;o warmly he urged his &s;uit, and dwelt &s;o forcibly on his ap|proaching departure, that the Barone&s;s cea&s;ed to oppo&s;e, and the &s;ilence of Laura yielded acquie&s;cence.

<PB N="156" REF="031067_0155_0FEA9CBCCB4C9018">
&s;afety, the Earl quitted the apartment elat|ed with hope. But the Baron had been informed of his projected e&s;cape, and had &s;tudied the means of counteracting it. The centinel had communicated his di&s;covery to &s;ome of his comrades, who, without virtue or courage &s;ufficient to quit the &s;ervice of the Baron, were de&s;irous of obtaining his favour, and failed not to &s;eize on an oppor|tunity, &s;o flattering as the pre&s;ent, to ac|compli&s;h their purpo&s;e. They communi|cated to their Chief the intelligence they had received.</P>
<P>Malcolm, careful to conceal his know|ledge of the &s;cheme, from a de&s;ign to en|trap tho&s;e of the clan who were to meet the Earl, had &s;uffered Edmund to return to his &s;tation at the pri&s;on, where he had placed the informers as &s;ecret guards, and had taken &s;uch other precautions as were nece&s;&s;ary to intercept their flight, &s;hould they elude the vigilance of the &s;oldiers, and likewi&s;e to &s;ecure tho&s;e of his people

who &s;hould be drawn toward the ca&s;tle in expectation of their Chief. Having done this, he prided him&s;elf in &s;ecurity, and in the certainty of exulting over his enemies, thus entangled in their own &s;tratagem.</P>
<P>After many weary moments of impati|ence to Alleyn, and of expectation to the Earl, the night at length arrived on which hung the event of all their hopes. It was agreed that Alleyn, with a cho&s;en few, &s;hould await the arrival of the Earl in the cavern where terminated the &s;ubterraneous avenue. Alleyn parted from James with extreme agitation, and returned to his tent to compo&s;e his mind.</P>
<P>It was now the dead of night; profound &s;leep reigned through the ca&s;tle of Dun|bayne, when Edmund gently unbolted the pri&s;on door, and hailed the Earl. He &s;prung forward, and in&s;tantly unclo&s;ed the pannel, which they fa&s;tened after them to prevent di&s;covery, and pa&s;&s;ing with fearful

&s;teps the cold and &s;ilent apartments, de&s;|cended the great &s;tair-ca&s;e into the hall, who&s;e wide and dark de&s;olation was render|ed vi&s;ible only by the dim light of the ta|per which Edmund carried in his hand, and who&s;e vaulted ceiling re-echoed their &s;teps. After various windings they de&s;|cended into the vaults; in pa&s;&s;ing their dreary length they often pau&s;ed in fearful &s;ilence, li&s;tening to the hollow bla&s;ts which bur&s;t &s;uddenly through the pa&s;&s;ages, and which &s;eemed to bear in the &s;ound the foot&s;teps of pur&s;uit. At length they reach|ed the extremity of the vaults, where Ed|mund &s;earched for a trap-door which lay almo&s;t concealed in the dirt and darkne&s;s: after &s;ome time they found, and with dif|ficulty rai&s;ed it, for it was long &s;ince it had been opened; and it was be&s;ides heavy with iron work. They entered, and letting the door fall after them, de&s;cended a narrow flight of &s;teps which conducted them to a winding pa&s;&s;age clo&s;ed by a door that open|ed into the main avenue whence Alleyn had
<PB N="159" REF="031067_0158_0FEA9D9A333252C0">
before made his e&s;cape. Having gained this, they &s;tepped on with confidence, for they were now not far from the cavern were Alleyn and his companions were a|waiting their arrival. The heart of Alleyn now &s;welled with joy, for he perceived a gleam of di&s;tant light break upon the walls of the avenue, and at the &s;ame time thought he heard the faint &s;ound of approaching foot&s;teps. Impatient to throw him&s;elf at the feet of the Earl, he entered the ave|nue. The light grew &s;tronger upon the walls; but a point of rock, who&s;e projec|tion cau&s;ed a winding in the pa&s;&s;age, con|cealed from his view the per&s;ons his eyes &s;o eagerly &s;ought. The &s;ound of &s;teps was now fa&s;t approaching, and Alleyn gaining the rock, &s;uddenly turned upon three &s;ol|diers of the Baron. They in&s;tantly &s;eiz|ed him their pri&s;oner. A&s;toni&s;hment for a while overcame every other &s;en&s;ation; but as they led him along, the horrid rever&s;e of the moment &s;truck upon his heart with all its con&s;equences, and he had no doubt
<PB N="160" REF="031067_0159_0FEA9CC913C57A48">
that the Earl had been &s;eized and carrried back to his pri&s;on. As he marched along, ab&s;orbed in this reflection, a light appear|ed at &s;ome di&s;tance, from a door that o|pened upon the avenue, and di&s;covered the figures of two men, who on perceiv|ing the party, retreated with precipitation, and clo&s;ed the door after them. Alleyn knew the Earl in the per&s;on of one of them. Two of the &s;oldiers quitting Alleyn, pur|&s;ued the fugitives, and quickly di&s;appear|ed through a door. Alleyn finding him|&s;elf alone with the guard, &s;eized the mo|ment of opportunity, and made a de&s;pe|rate effort to regain his &s;word. He &s;uc|ceeded; and in the &s;uddenne&s;s of the attack, obtained al&s;o the weapon of his adver&s;ary who, unarmed, fell at his feet, and called for mercy. Alleyn gave him his life. The &s;oldier, grateful for the gift, and fearful of the Baron's vengeance, de&s;ired to fly with him, and enli&s;t in his &s;ervice. They quitted the &s;ubterraneous way together. On entering the cavern, Alleyn found it
<PB N="161" REF="031067_0160_0FEA9D5D9AFD7C20">
vacated by his friends, who on hearing the cla&s;h of armour, and the loud and menac|ing voices of the &s;oldiers, under&s;tood his fate, and apprehen&s;ive of numbers, had fled to avoid a &s;imilar di&s;a&s;ter. Alleyn re|turned to his tent, &s;hocked with di&s;appoint|ment, and lo&s;t in de&s;pair. Every effort which he had made for the deliverance of the Earl, had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful; and this &s;cheme, on which was &s;u&s;pended his la&s;t hope, had been defeated at the very moment when he exulted in its comple|tion. He threw him&s;elf on the ground, and lo&s;t in bitter thought, ob&s;erved not the curtain of his tent undraw, till recalled by a &s;udden noi&s;e, he looked up and be|h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld the Earl. Terror fixed him to the &s;pot, and for a moment he involuntarily acknowledged the traditionary vi&s;ions of his nation. The well-known voice of O&s;bert, however, awakened him to truth, and &s;he ardor with which he embraced his knees, immediately convinced him that he cla&s;p|ed reality.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="031067_0161_0FEA9CCAA39953B8">
The &s;oldiers, in the eagerne&s;s of pur&s;uit, had mi&s;taken the door by which O&s;bert had retired, and had entered one below it, which, after engaging them in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch through various intricate pa&s;&s;ages, had conducted them to a remote part of the ca&s;tle, from whence, after much per|plexity and lo&s;s of time, they were at length extricated. The Earl, who had retreated on &s;ight of the &s;oldiers, had fled in the mean time to regain the trap-door; but the united &s;trength of him&s;elf and of Ed|mund was in vain exerted to open it. Com|pelled to encounter the approaching evil, the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> took the &s;word of his companion, re&s;olving to meet the approach of his ad|ver&s;aries, and to effect his deliverance, or yield his life and his misfortunes to the at|tempt. With this de&s;ign he advanced de|liberately along the pa&s;&s;age, and arriving at the door, &s;topped to di&s;cover the mo|tions of his pur&s;uers: all was profoundly &s;ilent. After remaining &s;ome time in this &s;ituation, he opened the door, and exam|ining
<PB N="163" REF="031067_0162_0FEA9D5FE8BDEE80">
the avenue with a firm yet anxious eye as far as the light of his taper threw its beams, di&s;covered no human being. He proceeded with cautious firmne&s;s to|wards the cavern, every in&s;tant expecting the &s;oldiers to &s;tart &s;uddenly upon him from &s;ome dark rece&s;s.&mdash;With a&s;toni&s;hment he reached the cave without interruption; and unable to account for his unexpected deliverance, ha&s;tened with Edmund to join his faithful people.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers who watched the pri&s;on, being ignorant of any other way by which the Earl could e&s;cape, than the door which they guarded, had &s;uffered Edmund to en|ter the apartment without fear. It was &s;ome time before they di&s;covered their er|ror; &s;urpri&s;ed at the length of his &s;tay, they opened the door of the pri&s;on, which, to their utter a&s;toni&s;hment, they found empty. The grates were examined; they remained as u&s;ual; every corner&punc; was ex|plored; but the fal&s;e pannel remained un|known;
<PB N="164" REF="031067_0163_0FEA9CCC5C9BBB00">
and having fini&s;hed their exami|nation without di&s;covering any vi&s;ible means by which the Earl had quitted the pri&s;on, they were &s;eized with terror, con|cluding it to be the work of a &s;upernatural power, and immediately alarmed the ca&s;|tle. The Baron, rou&s;ed by the tumult, was informed of the fact, and dubious of the integrity of his guards, a&s;cended to the apartment; which having him&s;elf examin|ed without di&s;covering any means of e&s;cape, he no longer he&s;itated to pronounce the centinels acce&s;&s;ary to the Earl's enlarge|ment. The unfeigned terror which they exhibited was mi&s;taken for artifice, and their &s;uppo&s;ed treachery was admitted and puni&s;hed in the &s;ame moment. They were thrown into the dungeon of the ca&s;tle. Soldiers were immediately di&s;patched in pur&s;uit; but the time which had elap&s;ed ere the guards had entered the pri&s;on, had given the Earl an opportunity of e&s;cape. When the certainty of this was communi|cated to the Baron, every pa&s;&s;ion who&s;e

&s;ingle force is mi&s;ery, united in his brea&s;t to torture him; and his brain, exa&s;perat|ed almo&s;t to madne&s;s, gave him only dire|ful images of revenge.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s and Laura, awakened by the tumult, had been filled with apprehen|&s;ion for the Earl, till they were informed of the cau&s;e of the general confu&s;ion; and hope and dubious joy were ere long con|firmed into certainty, for they were told of the fruitle&s;s &s;earch of the pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>It was now the la&s;t day of the term in which the Counte&s;s had &s;tipulated to return her an&s;wer; &s;he had yet heard nothing from Alleyn; for Alleyn had been bu&s;ied in &s;chemes, of the event of which he could &s;end no account, for their &s;ucce&s;s had been yet undetermined. Every hope of the Earl's deliverance was now expired, and in the angui&s;h of her heart, the Counte&s;s prepared to give that an&s;wer which would &s;end the devoted Mary to the arms of the
<PB N="166" REF="031067_0165_0FEA9CD0D8161788">
murderer. Mary, who a&s;&s;umed a fortitude not her own, &s;trove to abate the rigor of her mother's &s;ufferings, but vainly &s;trove; they were of a nature which defied con&s;ola|tion. She wrote the fatal agreement, but delayed till the la&s;t moment delivering it into the hands of the me&s;&s;enger. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that the Baron &s;hould receive it on the following morn, le&s;t the impatience of revenge &s;hould urge him to &s;eize on the life of the Earl as the forfei|ture of delay. She &s;ent, therefore, for the me&s;&s;enger, who was a veteran of the clan, and with extreme agitation delivered to him her an&s;wer; grief interrupted her voice; &s;he was unable to &s;peak to him; and he was awaiting her orders, when the door of the apartment was thrown open, and the Earl, followed by Alleyn, threw him&s;elf at her feet. A faint &s;cream was uttered by the Counte&s;s, and &s;he &s;unk in her chair. Mary, not daring to tru&s;t her&s;elf with the delightful vi&s;ion, endeavoured to re&s;train the tide of joy; which hurried to
<PB N="167" REF="031067_0166_0FEA9D68C8353240">
her heart, and threatened to overwhelm her.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Athlin re&s;ounded with tu|multuous joy on this happy event; the courts were filled with tho&s;e of the clan who had been di&s;abled from attending the field and whom the report of the Earl's return, which had circulated with a&s;toni&s;hing rapi|dity, had brought thither. The hall re|echoed with voices; and the people could hardly be re&s;trained from ru&s;hing into the pre&s;ence of their Chief, to congratulate him on his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of the meeting were &s;ub&s;ided, the Earl pre&s;ented Alleyn to his family as his friend and deliverer; who&s;e &s;teady attachment he could never forget, and who&s;e zealous &s;ervices he could never repay. The cheek of Mary glowed with plea&s;ure and gratitude at this tribute to the worth of Alleyn; and the &s;miling approbation of her eyes rewarded him for
<PB N="168" REF="031067_0167_0FEA9CD98705B2F0">
his noble deeds. The Counte&s;s received him as the deliverer of both her children, and related to O&s;bert the adventure in the wood. The Earl embraced Alleyn, who received the united acknowledgments of the family, with unaffected mode&s;ty. O&s;|bert he&s;itated not to pronounce the Baron the author of the plot; his heart &s;welled to avenge the repeated injuries of his fam|ily, and he &s;ecretly re&s;olved to challenge his enemy to &s;ingle combat. To renew the &s;iege he con&s;idered as a vain project; and this challenge, though a very inade|quate mode of revenge, was the only ho|nourable one that remained for him. He forbore to mention his de&s;ign to the Coun|te&s;s, well knowing that her tenderne&s;s would oppo&s;e the mea&s;ure, and throw dif|ficulties in his way, which would embar|ra&s;s, without preventing his purpo&s;e. He mentioned the misfortunes of the Barone&s;s and the loveline&s;s of her daughter, and excited the e&s;teem and the commi&s;eration of his hearers.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="031067_0168_0FEA9D6AA4C9F030">
The clamours of the people to behold their Lord, now aro&s;e to the apartment of the Counte&s;s, and he de&s;cended into the hall, accompanied by Alleyn, to gratify their zeal. An univer&s;al &s;hout of joy re|&s;ounded through the walls on his appear|ance. A noble plea&s;ure glowed on the countenance of the Earl at &s;ight of his faith|ful people; and in the delight of that mo|ment his heart bore te&s;timony to the &s;upe|rior advantages of an equitable government. The Earl, impatient to te&s;tify his gratitude, introduced Alleyn to the clan, as his friend and deliverer, and immediately pre&s;ented his father with a lot of land, where he might end his days in peace and plenty. Old Alleyn thanked the Earl for his offer|ed kindne&s;s, but declined accepting it; al|ledging, that he was attached to his old cottage, and that he had already &s;ufficient for the comforts of his age.</P>
<P>On the following morning, a me&s;&s;enger was privately di&s;patched to the Baron, with
<PB N="170" REF="031067_0169_0FEA9CDB1F659CE8">
the challenge of the Earl. The challenge was couched in terms of haughty indigna|tion, and expre&s;&s;ed, that nothing but the failure of all other means could have urg|ed him to the conde&s;cen&s;ion of meeting the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of his father, on terms of equal combat.</P>
<P>Happine&s;s was once more re&s;tored to Athlin. The Counte&s;s, in the unexpected pre&s;ervation of her children, &s;eemed to be alive only to joy. The Earl was now for a time &s;ecure in the bo&s;om of his family, and, though his impatience to avenge the injuries of tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to him, and to &s;natch from the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion the fair &s;ufferers at Dunbayne, would not allow him to be tranquil, yet he a&s;&s;umed a gaiety unknown to his heart, and the days were &s;pent in fe&s;tivals and joy.</P>

<P>IT was at this period, that, one &s;tormy evening, the counte&s;s was &s;itting with her family in a room, the windows of which looked upon the &s;ea. The winds bur&s;t in &s;udden &s;qualls over the deep, and da&s;hed the foaming waves again&s;t the rocks with inconceivable fury. The &s;pray, not|with&s;tanding the high &s;ituation of the ca&s;|tle, flew up with violence again&s;t the win|dows. The Earl went out upon the ter|race beneath to contemplate the &s;torm. The moon &s;hone faintly by intervals, through broken clouds upon the waters, illuming the white foam which bur&s;t a|round, and enlightening the &s;cene &s;uffici|ently to render it vi&s;ible. The &s;urges broke on the di&s;tant &s;hores in deep re&s;ound|ing murmurs, and the &s;olemn pau&s;es be|tween the &s;tormy gu&s;ts filled the mind with
<PB N="172" REF="031067_0171_0FEA9CDE2AFEA720">
enthu&s;ia&s;tic awe. As the Earl &s;tood wrapt in the &s;ublimity of the &s;cene, the moon, &s;uddenly emerging from a heavy cloud, &s;hewed him at &s;ome di&s;tance a ve&s;&s;el driven by the fury of the bla&s;t towards the coa&s;t. He pre&s;ently heard the &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s; and &s;oon after &s;hrieks of terror, and a con|fu&s;ed uproar of voices were borne on the wind&punc; He ha&s;tened from the terrace to order his people to go out with boats to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the crew, for he doubted not that the ve&s;&s;el was wrecked; but the &s;ea ran &s;o high as to make the adventure impracticable. The &s;ound of voices cea&s;ed, and he concluded that the wretched mari|ners were lo&s;t, when the &s;creams of di&s;|tre&s;s again &s;truck his ear, and again were lo&s;t in the tumult of the &s;torm; in a mo|ment after, the ve&s;&s;el &s;truck upon the rock beneath the ca&s;tle; an univer&s;al &s;hriek en|&s;ued.

Alleyn, who&s;e heart amid the anxieties and tumults of the pa&s;t &s;cenes, had &s;till &s;ighed to the image of Mary;&mdash;that im|age, which fancy had pictured in all the charms of the original, and who&s;e glow|ing tints were yet &s;oftened and rendered more intere&s;ting by the &s;hade of melancho|ly with which ab&s;ence and a hopele&s;s pa&s;|&s;ion had &s;urrounded them, found, amid the lei&s;ure of peace, and the frequent op|portunities which were afforded him of beholding the object of his attachment, his &s;ighs redouble, and the glooms of &s;orrow thicken.

Alleyn wi&s;hed to quit a place &s;o de&s;truc|tive to his peace as the ca&s;tle of Athlin; he formed repeated re&s;olutions of withdrawing him&s;elf from tho&s;e walls, which held him in a &s;ort of fa&s;cination, and rendered inef|fectual every half-formed wi&s;h, and every weak endeavour.

His heart beat quick at the &s;ight; the temptation was too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted; he concealed it in his bo&s;om, and pa&s;&s;ed on.

He in|formed him that he was a native of Swit|zerland, where he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable e&s;tates&punc; from which he bore the title of Count de Santmorin; that enquiry of much moment to his intere&s;ts had brought him to Scotland, to a neighbouring port of which he was bound, when the di&s;a&s;ter from which he had been &s;o happily re&s;cued, ar|re&s;ted the progre&s;s of his de&s;igns.

<P>The Baron advanced with his people, and quickly &s;urrounded the walls. With|in all was &s;ilent; the ca&s;tle &s;eemed to re|po&s;e in &s;ecurity; and the Baron, certain of victory, congratulated him&s;elf on the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterpri&s;e, when ob&s;erving the Earl, who&s;e per&s;on was concealed in armour, he called to him to &s;urrender him|&s;elf and his Chiefs to the arms of Malcolm. The Earl an&s;wered the &s;ummons with an arrow from his bow, which, mi&s;&s;ing the Barron, pierced one of his attendants. The archers, who had been planted behind the walls, now di&s;covered them&s;elves, and di&s;|charged a &s;hower of arrows; at the &s;ame time every part of the ca&s;tle appeared thronged with the &s;oldiers of the Earl, who

hurled on the heads of the a&s;toni&s;hed be|&s;iegers, lances and other mi&s;&s;ile weapons with uncea&s;ing rapidity. The alarum bell now rung out the &s;ignal to that part of the clan without the walls, and they immedi|ately poured upon the enemy, who, con|founded by this unexpected attack, had &s;carcely time to defend them&s;elves. The clang of arms re&s;ounded through the air, with the &s;houts of the victors, and the groans of the dying. The fear of the Ba|ron, which had principally operated on the minds of his people, was now over|come by &s;urpri&s;e, and the fear of death; and on the fir&s;t repul&s;e, they de&s;erted from the ranks in great numbers, and fled to the di&s;tant hills. In vain the Baron en|deavoured to rally his &s;oldiers, and keep them to the charge; they yielded to a &s;tronger impul&s;e than the menaces of their Chief, who was, now left with le&s;s than half his numbers at the foot of the walls. The Baron, to whom cow ardice was unknown, di&s;daining to retreat, continued the attack.

At length the gates of the ca&s;tle were thrown open, and a party i&s;&s;ued upon the a&s;&s;ailants, headed by the Earl and the Count, who divided in que&s;t of Malcolm. The Count &s;ought in vain, and the &s;earch of O&s;bert was equally fruitle&s;s; their ad|ver&s;ary was no where to be found. O&s;bert, apprehen&s;ive of his gaining admittance to the ca&s;tle by &s;tratagem, was returning in ha&s;te to the gates; when he received the &s;troke of a &s;word upon his &s;houlder; his, armour had broke the force of the blow, and the wound it had given was &s;light. He turned his &s;word, and facing his ene|my, discovered a &s;oldier of Malcolm's who attacked him with a de&s;parate courage. The encounter was furious and long; dex|terity and equal valour &s;eemed to animate both the combatants. Alleyn, who ob|&s;erved from his po&s;t the danger of the Earl, flew in&s;tantly to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the cri|&s;is of the &s;cene was pa&s;t ere he arrived; the weapon of O&s;bert had pierced the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his adver&s;ary, and he fell to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

The Earl di&s;armed him, and holding over him his &s;word, bade him a&s;k his life. "I have no life to a&s;k," &s;aid Malcolm, who&s;e fainting voice the Earl now di&s;covered, "if I had, 'tis death only I would accept from you. O! cur&s;ed&mdash;." He would have fini&s;hed the &s;entence, but his wound flowed apace, and he fainted with lo&s;s of blood. The Earl threw down his &s;word, and calling a party of his people; com|mitted to them the care of the Baron, and ordered them to proceed and &s;eize the ca&s;|tle of Dunbayne. Under&s;tanding their Chief was mortally wounded, the remains of Malcolm's army had fled from the walls. The people of the Earl proceeded without interruption, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The wounds of the Baron were examin|ed when he reached Dunbayne, and a du|bious &s;entence of the event was pronoun|ced. His countenance marked the power|ful workings of his mind, which &s;eemed

labouring with an unknown evil; he threw his eyes eagerly round the apartment, as if in &s;earch of &s;ome object which was not pre&s;ent. After &s;everal attempts&punc; to &s;peak, "Flatter me not," &s;aid he, "with hopes of life; it is flitting fa&s;t away; but while I have breath to &s;peak, let me &s;ee the Ba|rone&s;s." She came, and hanging over his couch in &s;ilent horror, received his words: "I have injured you, Madam, I fear beyond reparation. In the&s;e la&s;t few moments let me endeavour to relieve my con&s;cience by di&s;overing to you my guilt and my remor&s;e." The Barone&s;s &s;tarted, fearful of the coming &s;entence. "You had a &s;on." "What of my &s;on?" "You had a &s;on, whom my boundle&s;s ambition doomed to exile from his parents and his heritage, and who I cau&s;ed you to believe had died in your ab&s;ence." "Where is my child?" exclaimed the Barone&s;s. "I know not," re&s;umed Malcolm, "I com|mitted him to the care of a man and wo|man who then lived on a remote part of

<P>In the mean time the Earl, on quitting Malcolm, had returned immediately to the ca&s;tle, and was the fir&s;t m&s;&s;eenger of that event which would probably avenge the memory of his father, and terminate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his family. The &s;ight of O&s;|bert, and the news he brought' revived the Counte&s;s and Mary, who had retired du|ring the a&s;&s;ault into an inner apartment

of the ca&s;tle for greater &s;ecurity, and who had &s;uffered, during that period all the terrors which their &s;ituation could in&s;pire. They were &s;oon after joined by the Count and by Alleyn, who&s;e conduct did not pa&s;s unnoticed by the Earl. The cheek of Mary glowed at the relation of this new in&s;tance of his worth; and it was Alleyn's &s;weet reward to ob&s;erve her emotion. There was a &s;entiment in the heart of O&s;|bert which &s;truggled again&s;t the pride of birth; he wi&s;hed to reward the &s;ervices and the noble &s;pirit of the youth, with the vir|tues of Mary; but the authority of early prejudice &s;ilenced the grateful impul&s;e and &s;wept from his heart the characters of truth.</P>
<P>The Earl, accompanied by the Count, now ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne, to cheer the Barone&s;s and her daughter with their pre&s;ence. As they approached the ca&s;tle, the &s;tillne&s;s and de&s;olation of the &s;cene be&s;poke the &s;ituation of its lord;

his people were entirely di&s;per&s;ed, a few only of his centinels wandered before the ea&s;tern gate; who, having made no oppo|&s;ition, were &s;uffered by the Earl's people to remain. Few of the Baron's people were to be &s;een; tho&s;e few were unarmed, and appeared the effigies o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fallen great|ne&s;s. As the Earl cro&s;&s;ed the platform, the remembrance of the pa&s;t crowded upon his mind. The agonies which he had there &s;uffered,&mdash;the image of death which glared upon his &s;ight, aggravated by the bitter and ignominious circum&s;tances which attended his fate; the figure of Malcolm, mighty in inju&s;tice, and cruel in power; who&s;e countenance, &s;miling horribly in triumphant revenge, &s;ent to his heart the &s;troke of angui&s;h;&mdash;each cir|cum&s;tance of torture aro&s;e to his imagina|tion in the glowing colours of truth; he &s;huddered as he pa&s;&s;ed; and the contra&s;t of the pre&s;ent &s;cene touched his heart with the mo&s;t affecting &s;entiments. He &s;aw the innate and active power of ju&s;tice, which
<PB N="203" REF="031067_0202_0FEA9DAD591B0080">
pervades all the circum&s;tances even of this life like vital principle, and &s;hines through the ob&s;curity of human actions to the vir|tuous, the pure ray of Heaven;&mdash;to the guilty, the de&s;tructive glare of lightning.</P>
<P>On enquiring for the Barone&s;s, they were told &s;he was in the appartment of Mal|colm, who&s;e moment of di&s;&s;olution was now approaching. The name of the Count was delivered to the Barone&s;s, and over|heard by the Baron, who de&s;ired to &s;ee him. Loui&s;a went out to receive her noble relation with all the joy which a meeting &s;o de&s;irable and &s;o unlooked for, could in|&s;pire. On &s;eeing O&s;bert, her tears flow|ed fa&s;t; and &s;he thanked him for his ge|nerous care, in a manner that declared a deep &s;en&s;e of his &s;ervices. Leaving him, &s;he conducted the Count to Malcolm, who lay on his coach &s;urrounded with the &s;till|ne&s;s and horors of death. He rai&s;ed his languid head, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d di&s;covered a counte|nance wild and terrific, who&s;e gha&s;tly a&s;|pect

was over&s;pread with the palene&s;s of death. The beauteous Laura, overcome by the &s;cene, hung like a drooping lilly over his couch, dropping fa&s;t her tears. "My lord," &s;aid Malcolm, in a low tone, "you &s;ee before you a wretch, anxious to relieve the agony of a guilty mind. My vices have de&s;troyed the peace of this lady,&mdash;have robed her of a &s;on&mdash;but &s;he will di&s;clo&s;e to you the &s;ecret guilt, which I have now no time to tell. I have for &s;ome years received, as you now well know, the income of tho&s;e foreign lands which are her due; as a &s;mall reparation for the in|juries &s;he has &s;u&s;tained, I bequeath to her all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which I lawfully inherit, and re&s;ign her into your protection. To &aacute;&s;k oblivion of the pa&s;t of you, Madam, and of you, my Lord, is what I dare not do; yet it would be &s;ome con&s;olation to my departing &s;pirit, to be a&s;&s;ured of your forgivene&s;s." The Barone&s;s was too much affected to reply but by a look of a&s;&s;ent the Count a&s;&s;ured him of forgivne&s;s."
<PB N="205" REF="031067_0204_0FEA9DB10AF68C90">
and be&s;ought him to compo&s;e his mind for his approaching fate. "Compo&s;ure, my Lord, is not for me; my Life has been marked with vice, and my death with the bitterne&s;s of fruitle&s;s remor&s;e. I have un|der&s;tood virtue, but I have loved vice. I do not now lament that I am puni&s;hed, but that I have de&s;erved puni&s;hment." The Ba|ron &s;unk on his couch, and in a few mo|ments after expired in a &s;trong &s;igh. Thus terminated the life of a man, who&s;e under|&s;tanding might have reached the happine&s;s of virtue, but who&s;e actions di&s;played the features of vice.</P>
<P>From this melancholy &s;cene, the Baron|ne&s;s, with the Count and Laura, retired to her apartment, where the Earl awaited their return with anxious &s;olicitude.

"I can now, Madam," &s;aid he addre&s;&s;ing the Barone&s;s, "re&s;tore you a part of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which were once your Lord's and which ought to have been the inheri|tance of your &s;on; this ca&s;tle from hence|forth is your's; I re&s;ign it to its lawful owner." The Barone&s;s was overcome with the remembrance of his &s;ervices, and could &s;carcely thank him but with her tears. The &s;ervant whom the Baron had mention|ed as the confidant of his iniquities, was &s;ent for, and interrogated concerning the infant he had charge of. From him, how|ever, little comfort was received; for he could only tell, that he had conveyed the child, by the orders of his ma&s;ter, to a cottage on the furthe&s;t borders of his e&s;|tates, where he had delivered it to the care of a woman, who there lived with her hu&s;|band. The&s;e people received at the &s;ame time, a &s;um of money for its &s;upport, with a promi&s;e of future &s;upplies. For &s;ome years he had been punctual in the pay|ment of the &s;ums entru&s;ted to him by the
<PB N="207" REF="031067_0206_0FEA9DB5A8548620">
Baron, but at length he yielded to the temptation of with-holding them for his own u&s;e; and on inquiring for the people &s;ome years after, he found they were gone from the place. The conditions of the Barone&s;s's pardon to the man, depended on his endeavours to repair the injury he had promoted, by a &s;trict &s;earch for the people to whom he had committed her child. She now con&s;ulted with her friends, on the be&s;t means to be pur&s;ued in this bu|&s;ine&s;s, and immediately &s;ent off me&s;&s;en <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to different parts of the country to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> information.</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s was now relea&s;ed from op|pre&s;&s;ion and impri&s;onment; &s;he was re-in|&s;tated in her ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to which were added all the hereditary lands of Mal|colm, together with his per&s;onal fortune; &s;he was &s;urrounded by tho&s;e whom &s;he mo&s;t loved, and in the mid&s;t of a people who loved her; yet the con&s;equence of

the Baron's guilt had left in her heart one drop of gall which embittered each &s;ource of happine&s;s, and made her life melancholy and painful.</P>
<P>The Count was now her vi&s;itor; &s;he was much con&s;oled by his pre&s;ence; and Laura's hours were often enlivened by the conver&s;ation of the Earl, to whom her heart was tenderly attached, and who&s;e frequent vi&s;its to the ca&s;tle, were devoted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and her.</P>
<P>The felicity of Matilda now appeared as perfect and as permanent as is con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of &s;ublunary beings. Ju&s;|tice was done to the memory of her Lord, and her beloved &s;on was &s;pared to ble&s;s the evening of her days. The father of Laura had ever been friendly to the hou&s;e of Athlin, and her delicacy felt no repug|nance to the union which O&s;bert &s;olicit|ed. But her happine&s;s, whatever it might appear, was incomplete; &s;he &s;aw the &s;et|tled

melancholy of Mary, for love &s;till cor|roded her heart, and notwith&s;tanding her efforts, &s;haded her countenance. The Counte&s;s wi&s;hed to produce tho&s;e nuptials with the Count, which &s;he thought would re-e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of her child, and in|&s;ure her future felicity. She omitted no opportunity of pre&s;&s;ing his &s;uit, which &s;he managed with a delicacy that rendered it le&s;s painful to Mary; who&s;e words, how|ever, were few in reply, and who could &s;eldom bear the &s;ubject to be long conti|nued. Her &s;ettled aver&s;ion to the addre&s;&s;es of the Count, at length baffled the expectations of Matilda and &s;hewed her the falacy of her efforts. She thought it improper to &s;uffer the Count, any longer to nouri&s;h in his heart a vain hope; and &s;he reluc|tantly commi&s;&s;ioned the Earl to undeceive him on this point.</P>

were no where to be found, and no tracks was di&s;covered which might lead to the truth. The di&s;tre&s;s of the Barone&s;s can only be imagined; &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf, in calm de&s;pair, to mourn in &s;ilence the ea&s;y confidence which had intru&s;ted her child to the care of tho&s;e who had betrayed him. Though happine&s;s was denied her, &s;he was unwilling to with-hold it from tho&s;e whom it awaited; and at length yielded to the entreaties of the Earl, and became his ad|vocate with Laura, for the nuptials which were to unite their fate.</P>
<P>The Earl introduced the Counte&s;s and Mary to the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne, Similarity of &s;entiment and di&s;po&s;ition united Matilda and the Barone&s;s in a la&s;ting friend&s;hip. Mary and Laura were not le&s;s plea&s;ed with each other. The dejection of the Count at &s;ight of Mary, declared the ardor of his pa&s;&s;ion, and would have awakened in her brea&s;t &s;omething more than compa&s;&s;ion, had not her heart been pre-ocupied.

who could think of Mary only, wan|dered through the ca&s;tle of Athlin a &s;oli|tary being, who fondly haunts the &s;pot where his happine&s;s lies buried. His pru|dence formed re&s;olutions, which his pa&s;&s;ion as quickly broke; and cheated by love, though followed by de&s;pair, he delayed his departure from day to day, and the illu|&s;ion of ye&s;terday continued to be the illu|&s;ion of the morrow. The Earl, attached to his virtues, and grateful for his &s;ervices, would have be&s;towed on him every honour but that alone which could give him hap|pine&s;s, and which his pride would have &s;uffered him to accept. Yet the honours which he refu&s;ed&mdash;he refu&s;ed with a grace &s;o mode&s;t, as to conciliate kindne&s;s rather than wound genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>In a gallery on the North &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, which was filled with pictures of the family, hung a portrait of Mary. She was drawn in the dre&s;s which &s;he wore on the day of the fe&s;tival, when &s;he was led

She aro&s;e in con|fu&s;ion; the blu&s;h on her cheek betrayed her heart; &s;he was retiring in ha&s;te from Alleyn, who remained at the entrance of the room the &s;tatue of de&s;pair, when &s;he was intercepted by the Earl, who entered by the door &s;he was opening; her eyes were red with weeping; he glanced on her a look of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;plea&s;ure, and pa&s;&s;ed on to the gallery followed by Alleyn, who was now awakened from his trance. "From you, Alleyn," &s;aid the Earl, in a tone of di&s;plea&s;ure, "I expected other conduct; on your word I relied, and your word has deceived me." "Hear me my Lord," returned the youth, "your confi|dence I have never abu&s;ed; hear me." "I have now no time for parley," replied O&s;|bert, "my moments are precious; &s;ome future hour of lei&s;ure may &s;uffice." So &s;aying, he walked away with an abrupt haughtine&s;s, which touched the &s;oul of Al|leyn, who di&s;dained to pur&s;ue him with

further explanation. He was now com|pletely wretched. The &s;ame accident which had unveiled to him the heart of Ma|ry, and the full extent of that hap|pine&s;s which fate with-held, confirmed him in de&s;pair. The &s;ame accident had expo&s;ed the delicacy of her he loved to a cruel &s;hock, and had &s;ubjected his honour to &s;u&s;picion; and to a &s;evere rebuke from him, by whom it was his pride to be re&s;|&s;pected, and for who&s;e &s;afety he had &s;uffer|ed impri&s;onment, and encountered death.</P>
<P>Mary had quitted the clo&s;et di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and perplexed. She perceived the mi&s;take of the Earl, and it &s;hocked her. She wi&s;h|ed to undeceive him; but he was gone to the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne, to pay one of tho&s;e vi&s;its which were &s;oon to conclude in the nuptials, and whence he did not return till evening. The &s;cene which he had witne&s;&s;ed in the morning, involved him in a tumult of di&s;tre&s;s. He con&s;idered the mu|tual pa&s;&s;ion which filled the bo&s;om of his

&s;i&s;ter and Alleyn; he had &s;urpri&s;ed them in a &s;olitary apartment; he had ob&s;erved the tender and melancholy air of Alleyn, and the tears and confu&s;ion of Mary; and he at fir&s;t did not he&s;itate to believe that the interview had been appointed. In the heat of his di&s;plea&s;ure he had rejected the explanations of Alleyn with a haughty re&s;entment, which the late &s;cene alone could have excited, and which the delu&s;ion it had occa&s;ioned alone could excu&s;e. Cool|er con&s;ideration, however, brought to his mind the delicacy and the amiable pride of Mary, and the integrity of Alleyn; and he accu&s;ed him&s;elf of a too ha&s;ty deci&s;ion. The zealous &s;ervices of Alleyn came to his heart; he repented that he had treated him &s;o rigorou&s;ly; and on his return en|quired for him, that he might hear an ex|planation, and that he might &s;often the a&s;perity of his former behaviour.</P>

<P>ALLEYN was no where to be found. The Earl went him&s;elf in que&s;t of him, but without &s;ucce&s;s. As he returned from the terrace, chagrined and di&s;ap|pointed, he ob&s;erved two per&s;ons cro&s;s the platform at &s;ome di&s;tance before him; and he could perceive by the dim moon-light which fell upon the &s;pot, that they were not of the ca&s;tle. He called to them: no an&s;wer was returned; but at the &s;ound of his voice they quickened their pace, and almo&s;t in&s;tantly di&s;appeared in the darkne&s;s of the ramparts. Surpri&s;ed at this phoe|nomenon, the Earl followed with ha&s;ty &s;teps, and endeavoured to pur&s;ue the way they had taken. He walked on &s;ilently, but there was no &s;ound to direct his &s;teps. When he came to the extremity of the ram|part, which formed the North angle of the
<PB N="219" REF="031067_0218_0FEA9DD1F1A68A70">
ca&s;tle, he &s;topped to examine the &s;pot, and to li&s;ten if any thing was &s;tirring. No per|&s;on was to be &s;een, and all was hu&s;hed. After he had &s;tood &s;ome time &s;urveying the rampart, he heard the low re&s;trained voice of a per&s;on unknown, but the di&s;|tance prevented his di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;ub|ject of the conver&s;ation. The voice &s;eem|ed to approach the place where he &s;tood. He drew his &s;word, and watched in &s;ilence their motions. They continued to advance till, &s;uddenly &s;topping, they turned, and took a long &s;urvey of the fabric. Their di&s;cour&s;e was conducted in a low tone; but the Earl could di&s;cover by the vehe|mence of their ge&s;ture, and the caution of their &s;teps, that they were upon &s;ome de&s;ign dangerous to the peace of the ca&s;tle. Having fini&s;hed their examination, they turned a|gain towards the place where the Earl &s;till remained; the &s;hade of a high turret con|cealed him from their view, and they conti|nued to approach till they arrived within a &s;hort &s;pace of him when they turned
<PB N="220" REF="031067_0219_0FEA9DD58D46F4D0">
through a ruined arch-way of the ca&s;tle, and were lo&s;t in the dark rece&s;&s;es of the pile. A&s;toni&s;hed at what he had &s;een, O&s;|bert ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle, whence he di&s;|patched &s;ome of his people in &s;earch of the unknown fugitives; he accompanied &s;ome of his dome&s;tics to the &s;pot where they had la&s;t di&s;appeared. They entered the arch|way, which led to a decayed part of the ca&s;|tle; they followed over broken pavement the remains of a pa&s;&s;age, which was clo&s;ed by a low ob&s;cure door almo&s;t concealed from &s;ight by the thick ivy which over|&s;hadowed it. On opening this door, they de&s;cended a flight of &s;teps which led under the ca&s;tle, &s;o extremely narrow and broken as to make the de&s;cent both difficult and dangerous. The powerful damps of long pent-up vapours extingui&s;hed their light, and the Earl and his attendants were com|pelled to remain in utter darkne&s;s, while one of them went round to the habitable part of the ca&s;tle to relume the lamp. While they awaited in &s;ilence the return

The &s;ervants &s;hook with fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the Earl was not wholly unmoved. They remained entirely &s;ilent, li&s;tening its return, when a &s;ound of foot&s;teps &s;lowly &s;tealing through the vault, &s;tartled them. The Earl demanded who pa&s;&s;ed;&mdash;he was an|&s;wered only by the deep echoes of his voice. They cla&s;hed their &s;words and had advan|ced, when the &s;teps ha&s;tily retired before them. The Earl ru&s;hed forward, pur&s;uing the &s;ound, till overtaking the per&s;on who fled, he &s;eized him; a &s;hort &s;cuffle en&s;ued; the &s;trength of O&s;bert was too powerful for his antagoni&s;t, who was nearly overcome, when the point of a &s;word from an un|known hand pierced his &s;ide, he relinqui&s;h|ed his gra&s;p, and fell to the ground. His dome&s;tics, whom the activity of their ma&s;|ter had outran, now came up; but the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins, whoever they were, had accompli&s;h|ed their e&s;cape, for the &s;ound of their &s;teps was quickly lo&s;t in the di&s;tance of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

vaults. They endeavoured to rai&s;e the Earl, who lay &s;peechle&s;s on the ground; but they knew not how to convey him from that place of horror, for they were yet in total darkne&s;s, and unacquainted with the place. In this &s;ituation, every moment of delay appeared an age. Some of them tried to find their way to the entrance, but their efforts were defeated by the dark|ne&s;s, and the ruinous &s;ituation of the place. The light at length appeared, and di&s;covered the Earl in&s;en&s;ible, and welter|ing in his blood. He was conveyed into the ca&s;tle, where the horror of the Counte&s;s on &s;eeing him borne in|to the hall, may be ea&s;ily imagined. By the help of proper applications he was re&s;tored to life; his wound was exa|mined, and found to be dangerous; and he was carried to bed in a &s;tate which gave very faint hopes of recovery. The a&s;to|ni&s;hment of the Counte&s;s, on hearing the adventure, was equalled only by her di&s;|tre&s;s. All her conjectures concerning the de&s;igns, and the identity of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in,
<PB N="223" REF="031067_0222_0FEA9DDDEE8A6208">
were vague and uncertain. She knew not on whom to fix the &s;tigma; nor could di&s;|cover any means by which to penetrate this my&s;terous affair. The people who had remained in the vaults to pur&s;ue the &s;earch, now returned to Matilda. Every rece&s;s of the ca&s;tle, and every part of the ramparts, had been explored, yet no one could be found; and the my&s;tery of the pro|ceeding was heightened by the manner in which the men had effected their e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Mary watched over her brother in &s;ilent angui&s;h, yet &s;he &s;trove to conceal her di&s;|tre&s;s, that &s;he might encourage the Coun|te&s;s to hope. The Counte&s;s endeavoured to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the event with a kind of de&s;perate fortitude. There is a certain point of mi&s;ery, beyond which the mind becomes callous, and acquires a &s;ort of ar|tificial calm. Exce&s;s of mi&s;ery may be &s;aid to bla&s;t the vital powers of feeling, and by a natural con&s;equence con&s;umes its own principle. Thus it was with Ma|tilda;
<PB N="224" REF="031067_0223_0FEA9DE06DA77060">
a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of trials had re|duced her to a &s;tate of horrid tranquillity, which followed the fir&s;t &s;hock of the pre|&s;ent event. It was not &s;o with Laura; young in misfortune, and gay in hope, &s;he &s;aw happine&s;s fade from her gra&s;p, with a warmth of feeling untouched by the chill of di&s;appointment. When the news of the Earl's &s;ituation reached her, &s;he was over|come with affliction, and pined in &s;ilent angui&s;h. The Count ha&s;tened to O&s;bert, but grief &s;at hevy at his heart, and he had no power to offer to others the com|fort which he wanted him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A fever, which was the con&s;equence of his wounds, added to the danger of the Earl, and to the de&s;pair of his family. During this period, Alleyn had not been &s;een at the ca&s;tle; and his ab&s;ence at this time, rai&s;ed in Mary a variety of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing apprehen&s;ions. O&s;bert enquired for him, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee him. The &s;ervant who had been &s;ent to his father's cottage,
<PB N="225" REF="031067_0224_0FEA9DE41F765A10">
brought word that it was &s;ome days &s;ince he had been there, and that nobody knew whither he was gone. The &s;urpri&s;e was u|niver&s;al; but the effect it produced was various and oppo&s;ite. A collection of &s;trange and concomitant circum&s;tances, now forced a &s;u&s;picion on the mind of the Counte&s;s, which her heart, and her re|membrance of the former conduct of Al|leyn, at once condemned. She had heard of what pa&s;&s;ed between the Earl and him in the gallery; his immediate ab&s;ence; the event which followed, and his &s;ub&s;equent flight, formed a chain of evidence which compelled her, with the utmo&s;t reluctance, to believe him concerned in the affair which had once more involved her hou&s;e in mi&s;e|ry. Mary had too much confidence in her knowledge of his character, to admit a &s;u&s;picion of this nature. She rejected, with in&s;tant di&s;dain, the idea of uniting Alleyn with di&s;honour; and that he &s;hould be guilty of an action &s;o ba&s;e as the pre&s;ent, &s;oared beyond all the bounds of po&s;&s;ibility.
<PB N="226" REF="031067_0225_0FEA9DE5B1CDD508">
Yet &s;he felt a &s;trange &s;olicitude concerning him, and apprehen&s;ion for his &s;afety tor|mented her ince&s;&s;antly. The angui&s;h in which he had quitted the apartment, her brother's injurious treatment and his con|&s;equent ab&s;ence, all con&s;pired to make her fear that de&s;pair had driven him to commit &s;ome act of violence on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Earl, in the delirium of the fever, raved continually of Laura and of Alleyn; they were the &s;ole &s;ubjects of his ramblings. Seizing one day the hand of Mary, who &s;at mournfully by his bed &s;ide, and looking for &s;ome time pen&s;ively in her face, "weep not my Laura," &s;aid he, "Malcolm, nor all the powers on earth &s;hall tear you from me; his walls&mdash;his guards&mdash;what are they? I'll wre&s;t you from his hold, or pe|ri&s;h. I have a friend who&s;e valour will do much for us;&mdash;a friend&mdash;O! name him not; the&s;e are &s;trange times; beware of tru&s;ting. I could have given him my very life&mdash;but not&mdash;I will not name him." Then
<PB N="227" REF="031067_0226_0FEA9DE87ABE48C8">
&s;tarting to the other &s;ide of the bed, and looking earne&s;tly towards the door with an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;orrow not to be de&s;cribed, "not all the mi&s;eries which my wor&s;t ene|my has heaped upon me; not all the hor|rors of impri&s;onment and death, have ever touched my &s;oul with a &s;ting &s;o &s;harp as thy unfaithfulne&s;s." Mary was &s;o much &s;hocked by this &s;cene, that &s;he left the room and retired to her own apartment to in|dulge the agony of grief it occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Earl grew daily more alarming; and the fever, which had not yet reached its cri&s;is, kept the hopes and fears of his family &s;u&s;pended. In one of his lucid intervals, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Counte&s;s in the mo&s;t pathetic manner, he reque&s;ted, that as death might proba|bly &s;oon &s;eparate him for ever from her he mo&s;t loved, he might &s;ee Laura once a|gain before he died. She came, and weep|ing over him, a &s;cene of angui&s;h en&s;ued too poignant for de&s;cription. He gave her
<PB N="228" REF="031067_0227_0FEA9DEB26F85568">
his la&s;t vows; &s;he took of him a la&s;t look; and with a breaking heart tearing her&s;elf away, was carried to Dunbayne in a &s;tate of danger little inferior to his.</P>
<P>The agitation he had &s;uffered during this interview, cau&s;ed a return of phrenzy more violent than any fit he had yet &s;uffer|ed; exhau&s;ted by it, he at length &s;unk in|to a &s;leep, which continued without inter|ruption for near four and twenty hours. During this time his repo&s;e was quiet and profound, and afforded the Counte&s;s and Mary, who watched over him alternately the con&s;olations of hope. When he awoke he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible, and in a very al|tered &s;tate from that he had been in a few hours before. The cri&s;is of the di&s;order was now pa&s;t, and from that time it rapid|ly declined till he was re&s;tored to perfect health.</P>
<P>The joy of Laura, who&s;e health gradu|ally returned with returning peace, and
<PB N="229" REF="031067_0228_0FEA9DED9819CCC0">
that of his family, was &s;uch as the merits of the Earl de&s;erved. This joy, however, &s;uffered a &s;hort interruption from the Count of Santmorin, who, entering one morn|ing the apartment of the Barone&s;s, with letters in his hand, came to acquaint her that he had ju&s;t received news of the death of a di&s;tant relation, who had bequeathed him &s;ome e&s;tates of value, to which it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould immediately lay claim; and that he was, therefore, obliged, how|ever reluctantly, to &s;et off for Switzerland without delay. Though the Barone&s;s re|joiced with all his friends, at his good for|tune, &s;he regretted, with them, the nece&s;|&s;ity of his abrupt departure. He took leave of them, and particularly of Mary, for whom his pa&s;&s;ion was &s;till the &s;ame, with much emotion; and it was &s;ome time ere the &s;pace he had left in their &s;ociety was filled up, and ere they re&s;umed their wanted cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="031067_0229_0FEA9DF06F7AD4B8">
Preparations were now making for the approaching nuptials, and the day of their celebration was at length fixed. The ce|remony was to be performed in a chapel belonging to the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne, by the chaplain of the Barone&s;s. Mary only was to attend as bride-maid; and the Counte&s;s al&s;o, with the Barone&s;s, was to be pre&s;ent. The ab&s;ence of the Count was univer&s;ally regretted; for from his hand the Earl was to have received his bride. The office was now to be &s;upplied by a neighbouring Laird, whom the family of the Barone&s;s had long e&s;teemed. At the earne&s;t reque&s;t of Laura, Mary con&s;ented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;pend the night preceeding the day of marriage, at the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne. The day &s;o long and &s;o anxiou&s;ly expected by the Earl at length arrived. The morning was extremely fine, and the joy which glowed in his heart &s;eemed to give addition|al &s;plendor to the &s;cene around him. He &s;et off, accompanied by the Counte&s;s, for the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne. He anticipated
<PB N="231" REF="031067_0230_0FEA9DF320F36108">
the joy with which he &s;hould &s;oon retrace the way he then travelled with Laura by his &s;ide, whom death alone could then &s;e|parate from him. On their arrival they were received by the Barone&s;s, who en|quired for Mary; and the Counte&s;s and O&s;bert were thrown into the utmo&s;t con|&s;ternation, when they learned that &s;he had not been &s;een at the ca&s;tle. The nuptia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s were again deferred; the ca&s;tle was a &s;cene of univer&s;al confu&s;ion. The Earl returned home in&s;tantly to di&s;patch his people in &s;earch of Mary. On enquiry, he learned that the &s;ervants who had at|tended her, had not been heard of &s;ince their departure with their lady. Still more alarmed by this intelligence he rode him|&s;elf in pur&s;uit, yet not knowing which cour&s;e to take.

<P>MARY in the mean time, &s;uffered all the terror which her &s;ituation could excite. On her way to Dunbayne, &s;he had been overtaken by a party of arm|ed men, who &s;iezed her bridle, and after engaging her &s;ervants in a feigned re&s;i&s;t|ance, carried her off &s;en&s;ele&s;s. On recov|ering, &s;he found her&s;elf travelling through a fore&s;t, who&s;e glooms were deepened by the &s;hades of night. The moon, which was now up, glancing through the trees &s;erved to &s;hew the dreary a&s;pect of the place, and the number of men who &s;ur|rounded her; and &s;he was &s;eized with a terror that almo&s;t deprived her of rea&s;on. They travelled all night, during which a profound &s;ilence was ob&s;erved. At the dawn of day &s;he found her&s;elf on the &s;kirts of a heath, to who&s;e wild de&s;olation her eye could di&s;cover no limits. Before they entered on the wa&s;te, they halted at the
<PB N="233" REF="031067_0232_0FEA9DF8B9030C08">
entrance of a cave, formed in a rock, which was overhung with pine and fir; where, &s;preading their breakfa&s;t on the gra&s;s, they offered refre&s;hments to Mary, who&s;e mind was too much di&s;tracted to &s;uffer her to partake of them. She im|plored them in the mo&s;t moving accents, to tell her from whom they came, and whi|ther they were carrying her; but they were in&s;en&s;ible to her tears and her entrea|ties and &s;he was compelled to await, in &s;i|lent terror, the extremity of her fate. They pur&s;ued their journey over the wilds, and towards the clo&s;e of day approached the ruins of an abbey, who&s;e broken arch|es and lonely towers aro&s;e in gloomy gran|deur through the ob&s;curity of evening. It &s;tood the &s;olitary inhabitant of the wa&s;te,&mdash;a monument of mortality and of ancient &s;uper&s;tition, and the frowning maje&s;ty of its a&s;pect &s;eemed to command &s;ilence and veneration. The chilly dews fell thick, and Mary, fatigued in body, and harra&s;&s;ed in mind, lay almo&s;t expiring on her hor&s;e,
<PB N="234" REF="031067_0233_0FEA9DFA4CFFBE58">
when they &s;topped under an arch of the ru|in. She was not &s;o ill as to be in&s;en&s;ible to the objects around her; the awful &s;oli|tude of the place, and the &s;olemn a&s;pect of the fabric, who&s;e effect was heightened by the falling glooms of evening, chilled her heart with horror; and when they took her from the hor&s;e, &s;he &s;hrieked in the a|gonies of a la&s;t de&s;pair. They bore her over loo&s;e &s;tones to a part of the building, which had been formerly the cloi&s;ters of the abbey, but which was now fallen to decay, and overgrown with ivy. There was, how|ever, at the extremity of the&s;e cloi&s;ters a nock, which had with&s;tood with hardier &s;trength the ravages of time; the roof was here entire, and the &s;hattered &s;tanchions of the ca&s;ements &s;till remained. Hither they carried Mary, and laid her almo&s;t life|le&s;s on the gra&s;&s;y pavement, while &s;ome of the ruffians ha&s;tened to light a fire of the heath and &s;ticks they could pick up. They took out their provi&s;ions, and placed them|&s;elves round the fire, where they had not

long been &s;eated, when the &s;ound of di&s;|tant thunder foretold an approaching &s;torm. A violent &s;torm, accompanied with peals which &s;hook the pile, came on. They were &s;heltered from the heavine&s;s of the rain; but the long and vivid fla&s;hes of lightning which glanced through the ca&s;e|ments, alarmed them all. The &s;hrieks of Mary were loud and continued; and the fears of the ruffians did not prevent their uttering dreadful imprecations at her di&s;|tre&s;s. One of them, in the fury of his re|&s;entment, &s;wore &s;he &s;hould be gagged; and &s;eizing her re&s;i&s;tle&s;s hands to execute the purpo&s;e, her cries redoubled. The &s;er|vants who had betrayed her, were not yet &s;o entirely lo&s;t to the feelings of humanity, as to &s;tand regardle&s;s of her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s; though they could not re&s;i&s;t the tempta|tions of a bribe, they were unwilling their lady &s;hould be loaded with unnece&s;&s;ary mi|&s;ery.

fight for the deci&s;ion. Amid the peals of thunder, the oaths and execrations of the combatants, added terror to the &s;cene. The &s;trength of the ruffians were &s;uperior to that of their opponents; and Mary, be|holding victory deciding again&s;t her&s;elf, uttered a loud &s;cream, when the attention of the whole party was &s;urprized by the &s;ound of a foot&s;tep in the cloi&s;ter. Imme|diately after a man ru&s;hed into the place, and drawing his &s;word, demanded the cau&s;e of the tumult. Mary, who lay al|mo&s;t expiring on the ground, now rai&s;ed her eyes; but what were her &s;en&s;ations when &s;he rai&s;ed them to Alleyn!&mdash;who now &s;tood before her petrified with hor|ror. Before he could fly to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the attacks of the ruffians obliged him to defend him&s;elf; he parried their blows for &s;ome time, but he mu&s;t inevitably have yielded to the force of numbers, had not the trampling of feet, which fa&s;t approach|ed, called off for a moment their attention. In an in&s;tant the place was filled with men.

The a&s;toni&s;hment of Alleyn was if po&s;&s;ible, now encrea&s;ed; for the Earl, followed by a party, now entered. The Earl when he perceived Alleyn, &s;tood at the entrance, agha&s;t!&mdash;But re&s;uming his firme&s;s, he bade him defend him&s;elf. The loud voice of O&s;bert recalled Mary, and ob&s;erving their menacing attitudes, &s;he collected ju&s;t &s;trength &s;ufficient to throw her&s;elf between them. Alleyn dropped his &s;word, and rai&s;ed her from the ground; when the Earl rudely pu&s;hed him away, and &s;natch|ed her to his heart. "Hear me, O&s;bert," was all &s;he could &s;ay. "Declare who brought her hither," &s;aid the Earl &s;ternly to Alleyn. "I know not," replied he, "you mu&s;t a&s;k tho&s;e men whom your peo|ple have &s;ecured. If my life is hateful to you, &s;trike! and &s;pare me the angui&s;h of defending it again&s;t the brother of Mary." The Earl he&s;itated in &s;urpri&s;e, and the ge|nero&s;ity of Alleyn called a blu&s;h into his face. He was going to have replied, but was interrupted by &s;ome of his men, who

had been engaged in a &s;harp conte&s;t with the ruffians, two of whom they had &s;ecured, and now brought to their lord; the re&s;t were fled. In the per&s;on of one of them. the Earl di&s;covered his own &s;ervant, who &s;inking in his pre&s;ence with con&s;cious guilt, fell on his knees imploring mercy. "Wretch," &s;aid the Earl, &s;eizing him, and holding his &s;word over his head, "de|clare by who&s;e authority you have acted, and all you know of the affair;&mdash;remem|ber your life depends on the truth of your a&s;&s;ertions. "I'll tell the truth, my lord," replied the trembling wretch, "and no|thing el&s;e as I hope for mercy. About three weeks ago,&mdash;no, it is not &s;o much; about a fortnight ago, when I was &s;ent on a me&s;|&s;age to the lady Malcolm, the Count de Santmorin's gentleman&mdash;" "The Count de Santmorin!" re-echoed the whole com|pany.

"Be quick," &s;aid the Earl, "proceed to facts" "I will, my lord; the Count came, and &s;aid to me, "Robert, I have ob&s;erved you, and I think you can be faith|ful," he &s;aid &s;o, my lord,&mdash;God forgive me!" "Well&mdash;well, proceed." "Where was I?"&mdash;"Oh!" he &s;aid, "I think you can be faithful."&mdash;"Good God! this is beyond endurance; you trifle, ra&s;cal, with my patience, to give your a&s;&s;ociates time for e&s;cape; be brief, or you die."

O&s;bert, in a &s;tern voice. "I know not my lord." "You know not! Wretch! remember&mdash;your life" "I know not as I am a living creature. He embarked, as you know, my lord, not far from the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne, and we were travelling to a di&s;tant part of the coa&s;t to meet him, when we were all to have &s;et fail for Switzer|land." "You cannot be ignorant of the place of your de&s;tination," &s;aid the Earl, turning to the other pri&s;oner; "where is your employer?" "That is not for me to tell," &s;aid he in a &s;ullen tone. "Re|veal the truth," &s;aid the Earl, "turning towards him the point of his &s;word, "or we will find a way to make you," "The place where we were to meet the Count, had no name." "You know the way to it." "I do." "Then lead me thither." "Never!" "Never! Your life &s;hall an|&s;wer the refu&s;al." &s;aid O&s;bert, pointing the &s;word to his brea&s;t. "Strike &s;aid the Count, throwing off the cloak which had concealed him; "&s;trike! and rid me of a

A faint &s;cream was uttered by Mary; the &s;mall remains of her &s;trength for&s;ook her, and &s;he &s;unk on the pavement. The Earl &s;tarted a few &s;teps back, and &s;tood &s;u&s;pended in wonder. The looks of the whole group defy de&s;cription. "Take a &s;word." &s;aid the Earl, recovering him|&s;elf, "and defend your life." "Never, my lord, never! Though I have been hur|ried by the force of pa&s;&s;ion to rob you of a &s;i&s;ter, I will not aggravate my guilt by the murder of the brother. Your life has already been once endangered through my means, though not by my de&s;ign; Heaven knows the angui&s;h which that accident co&s;t me. The impetuo&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ion im|pelled me onward with irre&s;i&s;tible fury; it urged me to violate the &s;acred duties of gratitude&mdash;of friend&s;hip&mdash;and of huma|nity. To live in &s;hame, and in the con&s;|ciou&s;ne&s;s

"A|way&mdash;you trifle," &s;aid the Earl. "defend your&s;elf." The Count repeated his refu|&s;al. "And you, villain," &s;aid O&s;bert, turning to the man who had confe&s;&s;ed the plot, "you pretended ignorance of the pre&s;ence of the Count; your perfidy &s;hall be rewarded." "As I now plead for mer|cy, my lord, I knew not he was here," "The fellow &s;peaks truth," &s;aid the Count, "he was ignorant of the place where he was to meet me. I was approaching this &s;pot to di&s;cover my&s;elf to the dear object of my pa&s;&s;ion, when your people &s;urpri&s;ed and took me." Mary confirmed the te&s;timo|ny of the Count, by declaring that &s;he had not till that moment &s;een him &s;ince &s;he quitted the ca&s;tle of Dunbayne. She pleaded for his life, and al&s;o for the &s;er|vants, who had oppo&s;ed the cruelty of their comrades. "I am no a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in," &s;aid the Earl, "let the Count take a &s;word, and

The Earl &s;till urged him to de|fence; and the Count &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in re|fu&s;ing. Touched by the recollection of pa&s;t friend&s;hip, and grieved that a &s;oul like the Count's &s;hould ever be under the do|minion of vice, O&s;bert threw down his &s;word, and, overcome with a &s;ort of tender|ne&s;s&mdash;"Go, my lord, you per&s;on is &s;afe; and if it is nece&s;&s;ary to your peace,&mdash;&s;tretching forth his hand,&mdash;take my for|givene&s;s." The Count, overcome by his genero&s;ity, and by a &s;en&s;e of his own un|worthine&s;s, &s;hrunk back: "Forbear, my lord, to wound by your goodne&s;s, a mind already too &s;en&s;ible of its own deba&s;ement; nor excite, by your genero&s;ity, a remor&s;e too keen to be endured. Your reproaches I can bear.&mdash;your vengeance I &s;olicit,&mdash;but your kindne&s;s inflicts a torture too ex|qui&s;ite
<PB N="244" REF="031067_0243_0FEA9E14E7099760">
for my &s;oul." "Never, my Lord," continued he, the big tear &s;welling in his eye,&mdash;"never more &s;hall your friend&s;hip be polluted by my unworthine&s;s. Since you will not &s;atisfy ju&s;tice, by taking my life, I go to lo&s;e it in the ob&s;curity of di&s;|tant regions. Yet, ere I go, &s;uffer me to make one la&s;t reque&s;t to you, and to that dear lady whom I have thus injured, and on whom my eyes now gaze for the la&s;t time,&mdash;&s;uffer me to hope that you will blot from your memory the exi&s;tence of Sant|morin." He concluded the &s;entence with a groan, which vibrated upon the hearts of all pre&s;ent; and without waiting for a reply, hurried from the &s;cene. The Earl had turned away his head in pity, and when he again looked round to reply, perceived that the Count was departed; he followed his &s;teps through the cloi&s;ter,&mdash;he called&mdash;but he was gone.</P>
<P>Alleyn had ob&s;erved the Count with a mixure of pity and admiration; and he
<PB N="245" REF="031067_0244_0FEA9E16EA267760">
&s;ighed for the weakne&s;s of human nature. "How," &s;aid the Earl, returning eagerly to Alleyn,&mdash;"how can I recompen&s;e you for my injurious &s;u&s;picions, and my inju|rious treatment?&mdash;How can you forgive, or I forget, my inju&s;tice? But the my&s;tery of this affair, and the doubtful appearance of circum&s;tances, mu&s;t &s;peak for me." "O! let us talk no more of this, my Lord," replied Alleyn, with emotion; "let us only rejoice at the &s;afety of our dear lady, and offer her the comfort &s;he is &s;o much in want of." The fire was re|kindled, and the Earl's &s;ervants laid be|fore him &s;ome wine, and other provi&s;ions. Mary, who had not ta&s;ted any food &s;ince &s;he left the ca&s;tle, now took &s;ome wine; it revived her, and enabled her to take o|ther nouri&s;hment. She enquired, what happy circum&s;tance had enabled the Earl to trace her route. "Ever &s;ince I di&s;covered your flight," &s;aid he, "I have been in pur|&s;uit of you. Chance directed me over

the&s;e wilds, when I was driven by the &s;torm to &s;eek &s;helter among the&s;e ruins. The light, and an uproar of voices, drew me to the cloi&s;ter, where, to my unutter|able a&s;toni&s;hment, I di&s;covered you and Al|leyn: Spare me the remembrance of what followed." Mary wi&s;hed to enquire what brought Alleyn to the place; but delicacy kept her &s;ilent. O&s;bert, however, who&s;e anxiety for his &s;i&s;ter had hitherto allowed him to attend only to her, now relieved her from the pain of lengthened &s;u&s;pence. "By what &s;trange accident was you brought hither?" &s;aid he to Alleyn, "and what motive has induced you &s;o long to ab&s;ent your&s;elf from the ca&s;tle?" At the la&s;t que&s;tion, Alleyn blu&s;hed, and an invo|luntary &s;igh e&s;caped him. Mary under|&s;tood the blu&s;h and the &s;igh, and awaited his reply in trembling emotion. "I fled, my lord, from your di&s;plea&s;ure, and to tear my&s;elf from an object too dangerous, alas! for my peace. I &s;ought to wear away in ab&s;ence, a pa&s;&s;ion which mu&s;t ever be hope|le&s;s,
<PB N="247" REF="031067_0246_0FEA9E1D202D78F8">
but which, I now perceive, is inter|woven with my exi&s;tence.&mdash;But forgive, my lord, the intru&s;ion of a &s;ubject which is painful to us all. With &s;ome money, and a few provi&s;ions, I left my father's cottage; and &s;ince that time have wandered over the country a forlorn and mi&s;erable being, pa&s;&s;ing my nights in the huts which chance threw in my way, and de&s;igning to travel onward, and to enli&s;t my&s;elf in the &s;ervice of my country. Night overtook me on the&s;e wa&s;tes, and as I walked on comfortle&s;s and bewildered, I was alarmed by di&s;tant cries of di&s;tre&s;s. I quickened my pace; but the &s;ound which &s;hould have directed my &s;teps was cea&s;ed, and chilling &s;ilence en&s;ued. As I &s;tood mu&s;ing, and uncertain which cour&s;e to take, I ob&s;erved a feeble light break through the gloom; I endea|voured to follow its rays; it led me to the&s;e ruins, who&s;e &s;olemn appearance &s;truck me with a momentary dread. A confu&s;ed murmur of voices from within &s;truck my ear; as I &s;tood he&s;itating whether to enter,
<PB N="248" REF="031067_0247_0FEA9E1ED3593F40">
I again heard tho&s;e &s;hrieks which had a|larmed me. I followed the &s;ound; it led me to the entrance of this cloi&s;ter, at the extremity of which I di&s;covered a party of men engaged in &s;ight; I drew my &s;word and ru&s;hed forward; and the &s;en&s;ations which I felt, on perceiving the lady Mary, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed:" "Still,&mdash;&s;till Heaven de&s;tines you the deliverer of Ma|ry!" &s;aid the Earl, gratitude &s;welling in his eyes; "O! that I could remove that ob&s;tacle which with-holds you from your ju&s;t reward!" A re&s;pon&s;ive &s;igh &s;tole from Alleyn, and he remained &s;ilent. Ne|ver was the &s;truggle of oppo&s;ing feelings more violent, than that which now agitat|ed the bo&s;om of the Earl. The worth of Alleyn aro&s;e more con&s;picuou&s;ly bright from every &s;hade with which misfortune had veiled it. His noble and di&s;intere&s;ted enthu&s;ia&s;m in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, had at|tached him to the Earl, and had engaged him in a cour&s;e of enterpri&s;es and of dan|gers, which it required valour to under|take,
<PB N="249" REF="031067_0248_0FEA9E221DF835F0">
and &s;kill and per&s;everance to per|form; and which had produced &s;ervices for which no adequate reward could be found. He had re&s;cued the Earl from cap|tivity and death; and had twice pre&s;erved Mary in dangers. All the&s;e circum&s;tances aro&s;e in &s;trong reflection to the mind of O&s;bert; but the darkne&s;s of prejudice and ancient pride, oppo&s;ed their influence, and weakened their effect.</P>
<P>The joy which Mary felt on &s;eeing Al|leyn in &s;afety, and &s;till worthy of the e&s;|teem &s;he had ever bore him, was da&s;hed by the bitterne&s;s of reflection; and reflec|tion imparted a melancholy which added to the languor of illne&s;s. At the dawn of day they quited the abbey, and &s;et for|ward on their return to the ca&s;tle; the Earl in&s;i&s;ting upon Alleyn's accompanying them. On the way, the minds of the par|ty were variou&s;ly and &s;ilently engaged. The Earl ruminated on the conduct of Al|leyn, and the late &s;cene. Mary dwelt
<PB N="250" REF="031067_0249_0FEA9E276E8D53F0">
chiefly on the virtues of her lover and on the dangers &s;he had e&s;caped; and Alleyn mu&s;ed on his defeated purpo&s;es, and anti|cipated future trials. The Earl's thoughts, however, were not &s;o wholly occupied, as to prevent his que&s;tioning the &s;ervant who had employed by the Count, concerning the further particulars of his &s;cheme. The words of the Count, importing that he had once already endangered his life, had not e&s;caped the notice of the Earl; though they were uttered in a moment of too much di&s;traction to &s;uffer him to demand an explanation. He now enquired of the man, concerning the mi&s;terious &s;cene of the vaults. "You, I &s;uppo&s;e, are not ig|norant who were the per&s;ons from whom I received my wound." "I, my lord, had no concern in that affair; wicked as I am, I could not rai&s;e my hands again&s;t your life." "But you know who did." I&mdash;I&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, my lord, I was afterwards told,&mdash;But they did not mean to hurt your lord&s;hip." "Not mean to hurt me!&mdash;
<PB N="251" REF="031067_0250_0FEA9E2912402268">
What then were their de&s;igns, and who were the people;" "That accident hap|pened long before the Count ever &s;poke to me of his purpo&s;e. Indeed, my lord, I had no hand in it; and Heaven knows how I grieved for your lord&s;hip; and&mdash;" "Well&mdash;well, inform me, who were the per&s;ons in the vaults, and what were their de&s;ign." "I was told by a fellow &s;ervant; but he made me promi&s;e to be &s;ecret; but it is proper your lord&s;hip &s;hould know all; and I hope your lord&s;hip will forgive me for having li&s;tened to it.&mdash;'Robert,' &s;aid he, as we were talking one day of what had happened;&mdash;'Robert,' &s;aid he, 'there is more in this matter than you, or any bo|dy thinks; but it is not for me to tell all I know.' With that, I begged he would tell me what he knew; but he &s;till kept re|fu&s;ing. I promi&s;ed him faithfully I would not tell; and &s;o at la&s;t he told me&mdash;'Why,. there is my lord Count there, he is in love with our young lady; and to be &s;ure as &s;weet a lady &s;he is, as ever eyes looked up|on;

but &s;he don't like him; and &s;o find|ing him&s;elf refu&s;ed, he is determined to marry her at any rate; and means &s;ome night to get into the ca&s;tle, and carry her off.' "What, then!&mdash;was it the Count who wounded me?&mdash;Be quick in your rela|tion." "No, my lord, it was not the Count him&s;elf&mdash;but two of his people, whom he had &s;ent to examine the ca&s;tle; and parti|cularly the windows of my young lady's a|partment, from whence he de&s;igned to have carried her, when every thing was ready for execution. Tho&s;e men were let with|in the walls through a way under ground, which leads into the vaults, by my fellow &s;ervant, as I afterwards was told; and they e&s;caped through the &s;ame way. Their meeting with your lord&s;hip was accidental, and they fought only in &s;elf-defence; for they had no orders to attack any body." "And who is the villain that connived at this &s;cheme?" "It was my fellow &s;er|vant, who fled with the Count's people, whom he him&s;elf let within the ramparts.

Forgive me my lord; but I did not dare tell; he threatened my life, if I betrayed the &s;ecret."</P>
<P>After a journey of fatigue, and unplea|&s;ant reflections, they arrived on the &s;econd morning at the ca&s;tle of Athlin. The Counte&s;s, during the ab&s;ence of her &s;on, had endured a &s;tate of dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e. The Barone&s;s, in her friend&s;hip, had en|deavoured to &s;oothe her di&s;tre&s;s, by her con&s;tant pre&s;ence; &s;he was engaged in this amiable office, when the trampling of hor&s;es in the court reached the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ars of Ma|tilda. "It is my &s;on," &s;aid &s;he, ri&s;ing from her chair!&mdash;"it is my &s;on; he brings me life or death!" She &s;aid no more, but ru&s;hed into the hall, and in a moment af|ter cla&s;ped her almo&s;t expiring daughter to her bo&s;om. The tran&s;port of the &s;cene re|pelled utterance; &s;obs and tears were all that could be given. The general joy, how|ever, was &s;uddenly interrupted by the Ba|rone&s;s,
<PB N="254" REF="031067_0253_0FEA9E30CE8D20D0">
who had followed Matilda into the hall; and who now fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground; delight yielded to &s;urpri&s;e, and to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the object of it. On recovering, the Barone&s;s looked wildly round her;&mdash;"Was it a vi&s;ion that I &s;aw, or a reality?" The whole company mov|ed their eyes round the hall, but could di&s;|cover nothing extraordinary. "It was him&s;elf; his very air, his features; that benign countenance which I have &s;o often contemplated in imagination!" Her eyes &s;till &s;eemed in &s;earch of &s;ome ideal object; and they began to doubt whether a &s;udden phrenzy had not &s;eized her brain. "Ah! again! &s;aid &s;he, and in&s;tantly relap&s;ed. Their eyes were now turned towards the door, on which &s;he had gazed; it was Al|leyn who entered, with water which he had brought for the Counte&s;s, and on whom the attention of all pre&s;ent was now centered. He approached ignorant of what had happened; and his &s;urpri&s;e was great, when the Barone&s;s, reviving, fixed her
<PB N="255" REF="031067_0254_0FEA9E375D6E5128">
eyes mournfully upon him, and a&s;ked him to uncover his arm.&mdash;"It is,&mdash;it is my Philip!" &s;aid &s;he, with &s;trong emotion; I have, indeed, found my long lo&s;t child; that &s;trawberry on his arm confirms the de|ci&s;ion. Send for the man who calls him|&s;elf your father, and for my &s;ervant Pat|rick." The &s;en&s;ations of the mother and the &s;on may be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed; tho&s;e of Mary were little inferior to theirs; and the whole compa|ny awaited with trembling eagerne&s;s the arrival of the two per&s;ons who&s;e te&s;timony was to decide this intere&s;ting affair. They came. "This young man you call your &s;on?" &s;aid the Barone&s;s. "I do, an&punc; plea&s;e your lady&s;hip," he replied, with a degree of confu&s;ion which belied his words. When Patrick came, his in&s;tant &s;urpri&s;e on &s;eeing the old man, declared the truth. "Do you know this per&s;on?" &s;aid the Ba|rone&s;s to Patrick. "Yes, my lady, I know him too well; it was to him I gave

"Then God forgive me for having thus long detained him from you! but I was ignorant of his birth, and received him into my cottage as a foundling &s;uccoured by lord Malcolm's compa&s;&s;ion." The whole company crowd|ed round them. Alleyn fell at the feet of his mother, and bathed her hand with his tears.&mdash;"Gracious God! for what ha&s;t thou re&s;erved me!" He could &s;ay no more. The Barone&s;s rai&s;ed him, and again pre&s;&s;|ed him in tran&s;port to her heart.

"Such a mother! and have I &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter!" &s;aid he. Laura wept &s;ilently upon his neck the joy of her heart.

can indeed embrace you as my brother! The whole company now poured forth their joy and their congratulations;&mdash;all but Mary, who&s;e emotions almo&s;t over|came her, and were too powerful for ut|terance.</P>
<P>The company now adjourned to the draw|ing-room; and Mary withdrew to take that repo&s;e &s;he &s;o much required. She was &s;uf|ficiently recovered in a few hours to join her friends in the banquetting-room.</P>
<P>After the tran&s;ports of the &s;cene were &s;ub&s;ided&mdash;"I have yet much to hope, and much to fear," &s;aid Philip Malcolm, who was yet Alleyn in every thing but in name. "You, madam," addre&s;&s;ing the Barone&s;s,&mdash;"you will willingly become my advo|cate with her whom I have &s;o long and &s;o ardently loved." "May I hope," conti|nued he, taking tenderly the hand of Ma|ry, who &s;tood trembling by,&mdash;"that you

have not been in&s;en&s;ible to my long attach|ment, and that you will confirm the happi|ne&s;s which is now offered me?" A &s;mile of ineffable &s;weetne&s;s broke through the me|lancholy which had long clouded her fea|tures, and which even the pre&s;ent di&s;cove|ry had not been able entirely to di&s;&s;ipate, and her eye gave the con&s;ent which her tongue refu&s;ed to utter.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, for the remainder of the day, was occupied by the &s;ubject of the di&s;covery, and with a recital of Mary's adventure. It was determined that on the morrow the marriage of the Earl &s;hould be concluded.</P>
<P>On this happy di&s;covery, the Earl or|dered the gates of the ca&s;tle to be thrown open; mirth and fe&s;tivity re&s;ounded through the walls, and the evening clo&s;ed in uni|ver&s;al rejoicings.</P>
<P>On the following morn, the chapel of the ca&s;tle was decorated for the marriage

of the Earl; who with Laura, came at|tended by Philip, now Baron Malcolm, by Mary, and the whole family. When they approached the altar, the Earl addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his bride,&mdash;"Now my Laura," &s;aid he, "we may celebrate tho&s;e nuptials which have twice been &s;o painfully inter|rupted, and which are to crown me with felicity. This day &s;hall unite our families in a double marriage, and reward the worth of my friend. It is now &s;een, that tho&s;e virtues which &s;timulated him to pro|&s;ecute for another the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, my&s;|teriou&s;ly urged him to the recovery of his rights. Virtue may for a time be pur&s;ued by misfortune,&mdash;and ju&s;tice be ob&s;cured by the tran&s;ient triumphs of vice,&mdash;but the power who&s;e peculiar attributes they are, clears away the clouds of error, and even in this world reveals his THRONE OF JUS|TICE."</P>
<P>The Earl &s;tepped forward, and joining the hands of Philip and Mary,&mdash;"Surely,
<PB N="260" REF="031067_0259_0FEA9E4730626DC8">
&s;aid he, this is a moment of perfect happi|ne&s;s!&mdash;I can now reward tho&s;e virtues which I have ever loved; and tho&s;e &s;ervices to which every gift mu&s;t be inadequate, but this I now be&s;tow."</P>
