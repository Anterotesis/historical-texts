<P>MY Aim in this Addre&s;s to You, is, to di&s;charge &s;ome part of that Obli|gation I am under, to Your tender Care, &amp; mo&s;t friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to me &amp; my Family; to let the World know how much You have been my Friend, and

<P>BY this Means I have found out a way of fa&s;tning an Acknowledg|ment upon You, without leaving it in Your Power to refu&s;e me. For that Rea&s;on I have broke in upon You thus, without a&s;king Permi&s;&s;ion; if there be any Fault in that, it is owing to the utter Impatience I am under, of being always obliged.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE pe&s;tilential Di&s;ea&s;es that have of late Years walked their Rounds in</HI> Germany, Poland, Pru&s;&s;ia, Pomerania, Hungary, Ham|burgh, <HI>and &s;ome Parts of</HI> France, <HI>made us all very apprehen&s;ive for the</HI> public Health <HI>of our own Country. Proclamations were in|deed i&s;&s;ued out for a &s;trict Performance of the Quarantains, but the Impatience of Re&s;traint, &s;o natural to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>the Carele&s;ne&s;s of Officers, and the Avarice of tho&s;e who u&s;ually over&s;ee the Execution of &s;uch Orders, render tho&s;e Precautions le&s;s effectual among us; le&s;s to be depended on, and con&s;equently the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Providence of God the more con&s;pi|cuous.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We were alarmed afre&s;h, by the Mortality among our Cattle, a Judgment that had gone over all</HI> Europe, <HI>and for which there did not</HI>

<HI>&s;eem to be any human Remedy. We feared it was the Prelude to &s;ome greater and more ter|rible Deva&s;tation; but the Lord at length &s;aid to the de&s;troying Angel,</HI> it is enough, &s;tay now thine Hand.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiv. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>I was excited by the&s;e Providences, to re|view and put in order &s;ome Thoughts I had laid together upon the</HI> Importance of Health, <HI>its</HI> Precariou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>and its be&s;t</HI> Improvement.</P>
<P><HI>The World agrees in the Valuation of this Ble&s;&s;ing, and have a general Sen&s;e of its brittle Nature; and therefore I pretend not to make</HI> Di&s;coveries, <HI>but to make</HI> Impre&s;&s;ions, <HI>if I can, and to recommend that</HI> U&s;e and Im|provement of Health, <HI>without which it is indeed a Reproach upon any one to pretend to know that it is a Ble&s;&s;ing &s;o</HI> important <HI>and &s;o</HI> vani&s;hing.</P>
<P><HI>There is a great deal writ about the Pre|&s;ervation of Health. It is for the Service of Health, that Men have travelled, &s;tudied, &s;pent their Time, laid out their Money, their Strength, and even</HI> Health <HI>it&s;elf, in the Pur|&s;uit of Health: and yet after all, the</HI> Im|provement of this Health, <HI>is of greater Im|portance than the thing it&s;elf.</HI> Health, <HI>though a very great Ble&s;&s;ing, is not for its own &s;ake, but for &s;ome farther and nobler End. It is</HI>
<PB REF="008869_0007_1030A31B44620648">
<HI>to be regretted, that the mo&s;t delectable, mo&s;t diffu&s;ive, and mo&s;t e&s;teemed Ble&s;&s;ing in Nature, &s;hould be the lea&s;t</HI> improved, <HI>or not directed to its mo&s;t</HI> excellent Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary <HI>tells us, that when all the Books in</HI> China <HI>were ordered to be burnt by the Emperor</HI> Chiohamti, <HI>tho&s;e in</HI> Phy&s;ic <HI>were pre&s;erved by a peculiar Exception.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Letre 8.</NOTE> <HI>As if the</HI> Whole Duty of Man <HI>was only</HI> curare cuti|cuiam, <HI>to keep the Body in good Ca&s;e, and to &s;tudy nothing but how to</HI> be well.</P>
<P>Pindar <HI>has a bold Stroke, &s;peaking in the Prai&s;e of</HI> Health: A Man (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) that is in good Health, rich in Honour, and en|joys it all to a good Old Age, need not trouble him&s;elf about being a God.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Pindar. in Olympiis.</NOTE> <HI>I wi&s;h this were nothing but Poetry, Fiction, and Invention all, without any Example of any Character formed, or Lives led upon the &s;ame Sentiments. I wi&s;h the Profanene&s;s of the Turn were to be found no where but in the Poet, or that the Men of Riches, Health, and Honour, were &s;o mended &s;ince his Days, as that tho&s;e three things were not indeed to them in&s;tead of all that was</HI> divine. <HI>But, oh</HI> Pin|dar! <HI>will</HI> Health <HI>do in&s;tead of Immortality and eternal Life? Is there any Receipt for Immortality but this, that my Subject commu|nicates</HI>

<HI>to the World?</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the be&s;t Improve|ment of this be&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings? <HI>Having mentioned</HI> Health, Wealth, <HI>and</HI> Honour, <HI>do&s;t thou leave us there? Will it do any Harm to go farther, and to the charming Ideas of Health, Wealth, and Honour, join the Epithet of eternal? I can no more be &s;atisfied with any thing that I know mu&s;t come to an End, than I can be ea&s;y in thinking that my own Being would do &s;o. Why not a&s;pire to be</HI> Divine, <HI>though not to be a God? Why do&s;t thou &s;top &s;hort of that</HI> Health, <HI>tho&s;e</HI> durable Riches and Honours, <HI>for the &s;ake of which only, it was worth our while to have been born, and for the actual Enjoyment of which, it is at any time worth our while to die?</HI></P>
<P><HI>After all that is or can be &s;aid of</HI> Health, <HI>its highe&s;t</HI> Elogium <HI>is, that it is the greate&s;t temporal Ble&s;&s;ing, and enters as the chief In|gredient into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Happine&s;s of this Life.

<HI>I am &s;en&s;ible the Order of &s;ome Parts of this E&s;&s;ay might have been better di&s;po&s;ed, and how much it might have been enriched and improved by Per&s;ons of greater Acquaintance with that &s;ort of Learning that borders up|on the Subject. Nay, I am ready to think, that I could have made it more compleat my&s;elf, &s;ince the improvements I have recei|ved, and the Addition made to the little Knowledge I had before of the</HI> Human Structure, <HI>from the entertaining Lectures of the mo&s;t obliging Mr.</HI> Che&s;elden; <HI>in whom I know not which to admire mo&s;t, the Exqui&s;itene&s;s of his Skill, or the ea&s;y, frank, and generous Manner of his commu|nicating of it to the Curious. But my other Affairs would not permit me to write that Part over again, and &s;o I let it go with &s;uch Amendments as I could conveniently in&s;ert.

What I have produced, I judge &s;ufficient to illu&s;trate that Chapter which contains this Propo&s;ition, that</HI> Health for a con&s;iderable Time is a wonderful thing; that it is not to be depended upon.</P>
<P><HI>This would lead me to that part of a Pre|face which I have always thought might be&s;t of all be &s;pared: that is, a mighty Solicitude about the Reception of a Piece into the World. But I &s;hall &s;pare my&s;elf and Reader any far|ther</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Nature of Health.</HEAD>
<P>IT is ob&s;erv'd in the Nature of <HI>Light,</HI> that tho' it be the mo&s;t familiar to us of any Thing in the World, and <HI>That</HI> by which we &s;ee every Thing el&s;e, yet it is &s;o un|known to us in it&s;elf, and hardly to be defin'd. So it is in the Matter of Health, which is the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> of the little World: We better know when we are well, than we know properly what it is to be &s;o. I believe it is for this Rea&s;on that the
<PB N="2" REF="008869_0013_1030A32F92283180">
Sons of Art, who are the Tutelar Guardi|ans of our Health, are &s;o &s;paring in their Definitions of what it is their Profe&s;&s;ion to re&s;tore and maintain.</P>
<P><HI>Pythagoras</HI> calls it <HI>Harmony,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of Phys. Le Clerc.</NOTE> but does not de&s;cend into the Particulars of which it con&s;i&s;ts. 'Tis ob&s;erv'd of him, that he gives the &s;ame Name to <HI>Virtue,</HI> which is indeed the <HI>Health</HI> of the Soul, as Health is the <HI>Harmony</HI> of the Body. <HI>Harmony</HI> was with him one of the Names of the Deity; &s;o that this Word <HI>Harmony,</HI> &s;eems to have been a darling Word with him, which he gave to &s;everal good Things. But by <HI>Harmony</HI> in this Ca&s;e, he &s;eems to intend, a <HI>right Proportion, Quantity, and Temperature of all the Fluids; Soundne&s;s and Strength in all the Solids, to perform their Functions; and to render it complete, a Mind fit to direct all the Motions that obey the Will; which is, in a Word, the Univer&s;al Rectitude of the Animal OEconomy.</HI></P>
<P>All Things are now in their natural Or|der: The ju&s;t Mea&s;ures of the unerring Pul&s;e, the circulating Humours, and the moving Airs or Spirits, are all undi&s;turbed.</P>
<P>This is that <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ia,</HI> that good Tem|perature, and fitting Conformation, of all the Parts to their &s;everal U&s;es. This is

<HI>Plato's Symmetry of Con&s;titution,</HI> wherein he makes Health to con&s;i&s;t; to which he adds, That Sickne&s;s ari&s;es from the breaking of that ju&s;t Proportion of the Humours and Qualities in the Con&s;titution; which is the &s;ame Thing, I &s;uppo&s;e, with what others mean by the proper Mixture of Moi&s;t and Dry, Hot and Cold.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Alchmaeon <HI>in</HI> Galen.

<P>There are &s;o many Things go to make up Health, the want of any one of which would de&s;troy it, that a De&s;cription of Health may be very long, and yet very de|fective. Philo&s;ophers and Phy&s;icians both run mightily upon the Notion of a <HI>Balance</HI> of Humours, the due <HI>Temperament</HI> of all the Qualities, a Sort of Geometry in our Compo&s;ition, which is de&s;troyed by a Re|dundancy or Defect in any of the particu|lar Parts.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a &amp; jucunda eorum quibus Corpus animatum con&s;tat Temperatio, ad Actiones &s;ecundum Naturoe leges exerendas &amp; perfieiendas.</HI> Chauvin Lex Phil.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates'</HI>s Account of it is, when the Humours, Spirits, and Solids, of the Body are in their <HI>Natural State,</HI> while they ba|lance one another in Quality, Quantity, and due Mixture. On the contrary, Sickne&s;s is, when the Quantity of either of the&s;e is le&s;s or more than it &s;hould be, or when any
<PB N="4" REF="008869_0015_1030A3330F212B40">
of the&s;e Humours are di&s;charged from their proper Place, upon any particular Part of the Body,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hipp. de Natura Hom.</NOTE> which amounts to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As our Knowledge in the Animal OEconomy has improv'd, &s;o have the Ac|counts of this Matter been more accurate; and now we are told, <Q>That Life it &s;elf, &s;o far as it re&s;pects the Body, is, in one Word, the Circulation of the Blood, that is, its Motion in conical di&s;tractile Ve&s;&s;els, from the Heart to the extreme Parts of the Body, and its Return to the Heart again, by the &s;ame Canals inverted: And it is upon this that all Animal Functions, all Sen&s;e and Motion, voluntary and in|voluntary, do depend; &s;o that the Re|gularity of this Cour&s;e is the Mea&s;ure of <HI>Health,</HI> or mo&s;t perfect Life; as its vari|ous Irregularities are the Occa&s;ions of Sickne&s;&s;es and Di&s;ea&s;es, or a Beginning of Death.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Mead <HI>of Poi&s;ons.</HI> P. 155.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Tho' here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that Life does not con&s;i&s;t in the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the Blood <HI>only;</HI> for there is no Part but will lo&s;e its Motion and Sen&s;e, as certainly, by ob&s;tructing the <HI>Nerve</HI> that leads to it, as it will by Ob&s;tructions in the Blood Ve&s;&s;els: So that Life and Health &s;eem to depend

upon both. Stop the Nerves to the Heart, and it would as &s;oon lo&s;e its Motion, as the Brain would, if its Blood Ve&s;&s;els were &s;topp'd.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>As I have learned from the ingenious Mr.</HI> Che&s;elden.</NOTE> So that here is &s;uch a perfect Dependence upon the Motions of each other, that neither could begin fir&s;t, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;et a going, and kept in Motion, by a &s;uperior Agent, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that Power, <HI>in whom we live, and move, and have our Being.</HI></P>
<P>The Degree of this Health is always in Proportion to the Regularity of this Motion: A Man may be in Health that is not <HI>Ath|letic,</HI> which is the mo&s;t perfect and highe&s;t Degree of it.</P>
<P>When a lively Vigour po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every Part, and actuates the Whole; when the Juices, Humours, and Spirits, without Ob&s;truction, flowing in their proper Chan|nels; and the other Parts of the Body of a firm and la&s;ting Tone, and in their na|tural State perform their &s;everal Functions, agreeably to the whole animal OEconomy, with Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure; this is <HI>Health</HI> in Perfection, or highe&s;t Degree.

The next Ble&s;&s;ing in Value and Excellence is Health. This is nece&s;&s;ary to the perfect Enjoyment of a Man's &s;elf, and of every Thing about him, you can name after it. <HI>Knowledge and Learning</HI> ought to be men|tioned next: Health and Learning make the Philo&s;ophers happy Men. <HI>Thales</HI> gave this for An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion, Who was the happy Man? <HI>He</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that has a healthful Body, and a learned Mind.</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thales in La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

now it is Time to mention <HI>Liberty.</HI> Health and Liberty are Ble&s;&s;ings pretty much of a Size. Without <HI>Health</HI> we could not enjoy <HI>Liberty,</HI> nor without <HI>Liberty, Health.</HI> The publick Vows of the <HI>Roman</HI> People joined them together, as appears by the In&s;crip|tions. One would think that a Man with a good Con&s;cience, and healthful Body and a learned Mind, might, even without fair Liberty, make a Shift not to be mi&s;erable. On the other Hand, there are, to whom Liberty appears a greater Ble&s;&s;ing than Life it &s;elf. The Deci&s;ion here will very much depend upon the Degrees of Re&s;traint taken into the Ca&s;e.

<P>IF we were all Body, there could be no greater Ble&s;&s;ing than this. The Enter|prize, the Pur&s;uit, the Fini&s;hings, of the great and u&s;eful Affairs of Life, are owing to this. Stately Buildings, flouri&s;hing Arts and Sciences, learned Re&s;earches and Com|po&s;ures; the Hurry of thronged Streets, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Exchange; victorious Arms, a&s;&s;iduous Coun&s;els and Negotiations of Princes, the Spoils of War, or of Navi|gation; they all grow out of <HI>Health.</HI> What a Stagnation does the want of it bring upon all the Operations both of the Body Poli|tick and Natural? With the languid Mo|tion of the Blood, with fainting Spirits, fee|ble Limbs, heavy Pul&s;e, and a &s;inking Con|&s;titution, every Thing el&s;e &s;inks and lan|gui&s;hes.</P>
<P>Not only particular Per&s;ons are di&s;abled by want of Health in their private Affairs; and Families, where the chief Manager has been valetudinary, have dwindled in their Sub&s;tance and E&s;tate, the Vigour of the Mind decaying with that of the Body; and not only Humour and Invention, but even Judgment and Re&s;olution, &s;o far as con|cerns

the active Life, change and langui&s;h with the ill Con&s;titution of Body &amp; Health: But Kingdoms them&s;elves are very often affected by the Health or Sickne&s;s of tho&s;e that rule them; and the publick Health and Con&s;titution is very much felt in the Prince's Pul&s;e. <HI>Charles</HI> IX. King of <HI>France,</HI> 'twas very much to his weak and &s;ickly Con&s;titution that he owed the Mortification of &s;eeing a &s;ickly and convul&s;ed Kingdom. The Indi&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Rheuta,</HI> the &s;eventh King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave his Nephew &s;uch an Opportunity of practi&s;ing for the Crown, that he was obliged at length to re&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution langui&s;hes, where the Laws and their Admini&s;tration are not in|&s;pir'd with Vigour from him that &s;its at the Helm. Officers of State are the Nerves and Sinews of the publick Body: Where they are not quicken'd by a bri&s;k Spirit that flows down into them from the <HI>Head,</HI> they are not &s;o likely to exert them&s;elves with that Surene&s;s, Plea&s;ure, &amp; Ea&s;e. The publick Felicity &s;o much depends upon this, that all Religions agree in injoining the Duty of praying for Governors; and Chri&s;tianity, who&s;e Dictates, were they but ob&s;erved, would promote the Welfare of all Ranks and Orders of Men, both in this Life, and that to come, has in a particular Manner recommended this to every one of

its Profe&s;&s;ors, that they pray for <HI>Kings, and for all in Authority.</HI> This is never done with &s;o much &s;incere Vehemency, as when it is for &s;uch good Princes as are <HI>Mini&s;ters of God for Good</HI> to their People, <HI>a Prai&s;e to them that do well, and a Terror only to Evil-doers.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Within the&s;e 15 Years pa&s;t (&s;ays Sir <HI>William Temple</HI>) I have known a great Fleet di&s;abled for two Months, and there|by lo&s;e great Occa&s;ions, by an Indi&s;po|&s;ition of the Admiral, while he was nei|ther well enough to exerci&s;e, nor ill e|nough to leave the Command.

I have ob&s;erved the Fate of <HI>Campania</HI> determine contrary to all Ap|pearances, by the Caution and Conduct of a General, which were attributed by tho&s;e that knew him to his Age and In|firmities, rather than his own true Qua|lities, acknowledged otherwi&s;e to have been as great as mo&s;t Men of the Age. I have &s;een the Coun&s;els of a noble Coun|try grow bold, or timorous, according to the Fits of his good or ill Health that managed them, and the Pul&s;e of the Go|vernment beat high or low with that of the Governor; and this unequal Conduct
<PB N="14" REF="008869_0025_1030A353383C6878">
makes Way for great Accidents in the World: Nay, I have often reflected upon the Coun&s;els and Fortunes of the greate&s;t Monarchies, ri&s;ing and decaying &s;en&s;ibly with the Ages and Healths of the Princes and chief Officers that govern'd them. And I remember one great Mini&s;ter that confe&s;t to me, when he fell into one of his u&s;ual Fits of the Gout, he was no longer able to bend his Mind or Tho'ts to any publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor give Audi|ences beyond two or three of his own Dome&s;ticks, though it were to <HI>&s;ave a Kingdom;</HI> and that this proceeded not from any Violence of Pain, but from a general Langui&s;hing and Faintne&s;s of Spirits, which made him in tho&s;e Fits think nothing worth the Trouble of one careful and &s;ollicitous Thought: For the Approaches or Lurking of the Gout, the Spleen, or the Scurvy, nay, the very Fumes of Indige&s;tion, may indi&s;po&s;e Men to Thought and to Care, as well as Di&s;|ea&s;es of Danger and Pain.</P>
<P>Thus Accidents of Health grow to be Accidents of State; and the publick Con&s;titutions come to depend in a great Mea&s;ure upon tho&s;e of particular Men: Which makes it perhaps &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary in the Choice of Per&s;ons for great Im|ployments (at lea&s;t &s;uch as require con|&s;tant

<P>I Have already taken Notice that &s;uch is the Folly of Mankind, that we un|der&s;tand and value our Ble&s;&s;ings more by the Want of them, than by their Enjoy|ment.

him&s;elf from the twentieth Part of the Hazard or Trouble in the Service of God, or the Good of Mankind, which he throws away in O&s;tentation of a robu&s;t Con&s;ti|tution.

<P>IT is indeed too valuable to be trifled with; but we ought to remember, that it is not the only Jewel that we have: And to continue the Allu&s;ion, we &s;hould manage it as we do tho&s;e precious Parts of our Trea&s;ure; we neither &s;uffer them carele&s;ly to lie about the Hou&s;e, nor are we hover|ing perpetually over them; becau&s;e they are precious they are not always under Lock and Key, nor are produced without Care and Caution: As valuable a Thing as Health is confe&s;&s;ed to be, every Thing is not to be made a Sacrifice to it.

<P>God forbid that I &s;hould in&s;inuate a Charge upon Ca&s;es wherein God makes Allowance, and <HI>will have Mercy rather than Sacrifice.</HI> Such is the Condition of many aged and infirm, and otherwi&s;e di&s;abled Per&s;ons.

<P>THAT which is of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Make, may with much Difficulty and Hazard, po&s;&s;ibly, be pre&s;erved in its natural State, by a great deal of Care to keep it out of Harms Way; but that's impo&s;&s;ible in this Ca&s;e; the bare Change of Weather may as well di&s;compo&s;e the Body, as untune the Strings of an In&s;trument. This is re|pre&s;ented by one of the Faculty, in the fol|lowing Manner:<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Wainright, <HI>his Non Naturals.</HI> p. 61.</NOTE> <Q>It is &s;o far (&s;ays he) from being a Wonder, that we &s;ometimes &s;uffer in our Health by Change of Wea|ther, that it is the greate&s;t Wonder we do not always &s;o; for, when we con&s;ider, that our Bodies are &s;ometimes pre&s;&s;ed up|on by a Tun and an half Weight more than at another, and that this Variation is often very &s;udden; it is &s;urprizing that every &s;uch Change &s;hould not entirely break the Frame of our Bodies to pieces, and be the con&s;tant Harbinger of &s;udden Death. One would think that when &s;o many of the Ve&s;&s;els of our Bodies are

&s;traitned by the increa&s;ed Pre&s;&s;ure, that the Blood would &s;tagnate up to the very Heart; which not being able to contract it &s;elf, the Circulation would cea&s;e, and we &s;hould die. But &s;uch is the Contri|vance of infinite Wi&s;dom, that when the Re&s;i&s;tance to the circulating Blood is greate&s;t, the Impetus by which the Heart contracts, &s;hould be &s;o too. The Weight of the Air increa&s;ing, the Lungs will be more forceably expanded, and hereby the Blood more intimately broken and di|vided, &s;o that it becomes fitter for the mo&s;t fluid Secretions, &s;uch as that of the Animal Spirits, by which the Heart will be more &s;trongly contracted; the Bloods Motion toward the Surface of the Body being ob&s;tructed, it will pa&s;s in greater Quantity to the Brain, where the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Air is taken off by the Cranium; and, upon this Score, more Spirits will be &s;eparated, whereby the Heart will be &s;o &s;trongly contracted as to carry on the Circulation thro' the pa&s;&s;able Canals, whil&s;t &s;ome others are ob&s;tructed.</Q> Thus far the Doctor.</P>

<P>When we turn our Eyes from the Nice|ne&s;s of the Frame to the infinite Accidents that are every where ready to ruffle and de&s;troy it, it increa&s;es the Wonder!

III. This Con&s;ideration of God's having the ab&s;olute Power of Life and Death, <HI>gives a great deal of Force to all the Motives of Religion,</HI> and is a great means to pre&s;erve it in the World.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider,&mdash;The Object of my Wor&s;hip is the Ma&s;ter of my Life and Health! Surely it concerns me to live to him by whom I live at all! 'Tis but for him to be di&s;plea&s;ed, and I die.

None can ble&s;s me as God can ble&s;s me: Nor can any cur&s;e me as God can. He can ble&s;s me &s;o, as that all the Cur&s;es in the World &s;hall be but as throwing Fea|thers again&s;t a Rock: He can cur&s;e me &s;o, as that all the Ble&s;&s;ings in the World &s;hall be but &s;o many loud and &s;udden Wi&s;hes for a Man that is already fallen over a Pre|cipice. <HI>Whom thou ble&s;&s;e&s;t, they are ble&s;&s;ed indeed; and whom thou cur&s;e&s;t, they are cur|&s;ed indeed.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="94" REF="008869_0105_10308D3B5CABB8C0">
This Thought puts a mighty Efficacy, I &s;ay, into all the Motives of Religion, the Calls of his Word, the Intreaties of his Em|ba&s;&s;adors, the Motions of his Spirit, the Promi&s;es of Heaven, the Threats of Hell: For all the&s;e are the In&s;tances and Appli|cations of one who has the Power of my Health and Life, and can ea&s;ily avenge him&s;elf of any Affront or Slight, of any Neglect or Delay, at the Co&s;t of one or both of the&s;e.</P>
<P>IV. Hereby God has it in his Power to <HI>ble&s;s or puni&s;h a great many at once.</HI></P>
<P>The Happine&s;s of a great many is very often wrapp'd up in the Life and Health of one: And therefore 'tis not fit &s;uch a Power &s;hould be in the Hands of any other Being, but one of infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s. Providence often hangs many Weights upon one &s;ingle String, and when that breaks, all falls to the Ground at once. If we go into the Hou&s;es of Mourning we &s;hall &s;ee and hear mo&s;t affecting Evidences of this from the di&s;con&s;olate Widow, the fatherle&s;s Children, the &s;orrowful Friends; all have a long and mournful Story to tell, how much they have &s;uffer'd in the Lo&s;s of the Relation, or Friend, or u&s;eful Man; how much Bu&s;ine&s;s there is a Stop to; or on the other Hand, how many good Works

are now no more; and how many &s;uffer by that Means, who depended upon him, or were the better for him. The&s;e are Things of &s;uch Con&s;equence in the World, that the Power of Life and Health ought to be only in the Hand 'tis in; and is too big a Tru&s;t to be lodged with Angels or Men: I mean the ab&s;olute Power over it, which can belong to none but God.</P>
<P>V. Life and Health <HI>are the Time of my Probation for Eternity, and therefore ought to be in no meaner Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Mine eternal Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery is wrapp'd up in this little Life of mine: If I die before I am fit to die, I am undone; and for that Rea&s;on I would not have the Power of my Life and Death, my Health and Sickne&s;s, in the Hand of any but the wi&s;e and good Governor of the World, for all the World. Who knows what Mea|&s;ure of Health or Sickne&s;s is fitte&s;t to work upon the Con&s;cience? Who knows &s;o per|fectly well how to temper the Cup? What Sort and Mea&s;ure of Ingredients to put in|to it, that may reach the Ca&s;e, when to be|gin, and when to &s;top? If this Power were lodged in our Hands, we are &s;uch poor Creatures, we &s;hould hardly ever touch or afflict &s;ome, nor &s;hould we &s;pare others; we &s;hould deal with too much Fondne&s;s, or
<PB N="96" REF="008869_0107_10308D3FE2523588">
too much Severity: There are &s;ome we would never &s;uffer to be &s;ick, nor die; and there are others, whom we &s;hould long ago have hurried out of the World, not know|ing how to have made the &s;ame U&s;e of them in it that God does. He only knows when the <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath,</HI> that will not be clean&s;ed are <HI>fitted for De&s;truction,</HI> and have filled up the <HI>Mea&s;ure of their Iniquity.</HI> And on the other Hand, he only knows the Ca&s;e of every good Man, how far they are to be cha&s;ti&s;ed, that they may not be <HI>condemned with the World:</HI> He knows when they have done all their Work for him, and when he has done all his Work in them, and <HI>fulfilled the good Plea&s;ure of his Will in them, and the Work of Faith with Power.</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e Things were left to us, how would fond Relations ever know when 'twas fit to let go, and take Leave? What a ten|der Partiality would there be in the Hu&s;|band to the Wife, the Parent to the be|loved Child, and the Friend that is nearer than the Brother? However needful a Fit of Sickne&s;s was, it &s;hould never come; and however fitted a good Man was for Heaven, he &s;hould not be permitted to go: We &s;hould not know when 'twas Time to retire, and take our Leave, or &s;uffer our Friends to do &s;o.</P>

VI. <HI>'Tis beyond any Skill but the Divine to order the coming into the World, and go|ing out of it, in &s;uch a Proportion, both as to Numbers of Per&s;ons, and Di&s;tance of Time, as may be&s;t agree with the needful Succe&s;&s;ion of one Generation pa&s;&s;ing away, and another coming</HI> upon the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>This requires great Skill to prevent Confu&s;ion, Deficiency, or Superfoetation of human Race.&mdash;But how ea&s;y is all this to him, who declares his Concern a|bout Matters va&s;tly le&s;s than humane Life, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that he numbers the very <HI>Hairs of our Head,</HI> that one of them &s;hall <HI>not fall to the Ground without our Father;</HI> how much le&s;s our Head it &s;elf be laid in the Grave any otherwi&s;e than <HI>when</HI> and as he plea&s;es?</P>
<P>The U&s;e that we &s;hould make of &s;uch a Truth as this, is,</P>
<P><HI>This accounts for &s;ome Things we can't tell what to make of in the Providence of God, about the Health and Life of &s;ome Per&s;ons;</HI> that &s;ome weak Per&s;ons &s;hould live a long while, when others of a more healthy Con&s;titution are cut off; that &s;ome pious, u&s;eful, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> excellent Per&s;ons are &s;o &s;ickly, and (as we think) immaturely taken away, while &s;ome of a very diffe|rent Character are healthy, and attain a

<HI>great,</HI> though not a <HI>good</HI> Old Age. Some barren Trees are &s;uffer'd to <HI>cumber the Ground</HI> a long Time, when others that are fruitful are tran&s;planted into the Paradi&s;e of God, in Reward to them&s;elves, and Pu|ni&s;hment to the World that's left behind.

<P>Again, <HI>'Tis Matter of Comfort that my Health and Life is in &s;o Wi&s;e and Good a Hand.</HI> It's of too great Importance both to me and others to have it any where el&s;e, for the Rea&s;ons above mentioned. If Men are &s;uffered to kill the Body, it's becau&s;e he &s;uffers them, who has its Life in his Hand, and not they. 'Till he permits it I am immortal: All the Devils in Hell, all the Men in the World, all the Di&s;tempers in the Di&s;pen&s;ary, all the Plagues and Pe&s;ti|lences, Inva&s;ions and Famines, that ever &s;wept away their Millions from the Face of the Earth, &s;hall not de&s;troy my Life till they have his Commi&s;&s;ion, who&s;e Preroga|tive it is to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill, and to make alive.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>This aggravates the Sin of Mur|der, and what&s;oever tends to it.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis offering to take the Power of Life

<P>Again, This &s;hould teach us <HI>not to fear Men &s;o as to offend God;</HI> not only, as our Saviour &s;ays, becau&s;e <HI>they can only kill the Body,</HI> but becau&s;e they cannot &s;o much as do that neither without God's Permi&s;&s;ion, in whom alone is the Power of Life and Death; nay, and what's more, who can kill the Body as well as Men, and without the Hand of any Man. The Life I &s;ave by offending God, God can ea&s;ily take away him&s;elf. If a Man &s;ay, I'll kill you unle&s;s you do this, or that, let me remember that God &s;ays, <HI>I kill, and I make alive;</HI> and al&s;o, that unle&s;s God permit, the Tyrant can't.</P>
<P>The Martyr was full of this Thought, who, when his Life was offer'd him upon Condition of his Recantation, an&s;wered, <HI>Though you don't take away my Life to Day, can you a&s;&s;ure me that God won't do it to Mor|row?

<P>But dare any of the&s;e Saints pre&s;ume to &s;peak &s;uch Words as the&s;e, <HI>I kill, and I make alive?</HI> Is Health and Life in their Power?

<P>THE Government of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> is a great part of practical Religion, as well as a good Direction in Phy&s;ic. 'Tis a Pre&s;ervative from Sin, as well as from Di&s;ea&s;e, and without it, there can be neither Religion nor Health. The Seat of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and of Health, are &s;o much the &s;ame: <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Blood and Spirits, that they mu&s;t have a near Relation to, and Influence upon each other. The Perturbation of ei|ther, mu&s;t affect both. It's all one if the Sediment be rai&s;ed, whether it be by Agitation from without, or Fermentation within; if our <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> which have their Seat in the Blood and Spirits, be not under Government, it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e Spi|rits and that Blood, to be in their natural State.</P>

<P>All the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of the Mind range them|&s;elves under the&s;e two, <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Auger,</HI> which the Schools di&s;tingui&s;h by the Name of the <HI>Concupi&s;cible</HI> and the <HI>Ira&s;cible;</HI> all of them <HI>Murderers from the Beginning,</HI> as it was &s;aid of him who fir&s;t rai&s;ed and armed them again&s;t our&s;elves and our God.</P>
<P>It would look too remote to charge them with the fir&s;t Introduction of all Di&s;tem|pers and Death, and yet it is &s;o true, that I can't omit &s;aying, that there had never been any Di&s;ea&s;es or Death at all in the World, had the Pa&s;&s;ions of Man been go|verned as they ought to have been. Ap|petite and eager De&s;ire, Pride and Ambi|tion, have rival'd Plagues and Pe&s;tilences, and all the Di&s;ea&s;es put together, for the De&s;olation wherewith they have filled the World.</P>

Envy, Pride, Anger, inordinate Grief, Fears, Hopes, De&s;ires, Joys in their Exce&s;s, have been mortal, have done the Work of Sword and Poi&s;on, as well as of Di&s;ea&s;es, and that not only in their long Continu|ance and di&s;tant Con&s;equences, but in their immediate Influence.</P>

<P>There are modern Stories too of &s;ome, to whom exce&s;&s;ive Joy has been fatal.

<P>THUS have I gone through this Sub|ject of Health. My chief De&s;ign in it was to increa&s;e our <HI>Value</HI> for the Ble&s;&s;ing, to direct how to avoid the <HI>Sins</HI> of it, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t towards the be&s;t Improvement of it, in the <HI>Duties</HI> that belong to it.

<P>If any &s;ay that &s;ome Per&s;ons, who pract|i&s;e all the&s;e Things we call Pre&s;ervatives, do yet &s;icken and die as well as others, and &s;ome that mind none of them are healthful: I an&s;wer;</P>

We have all along allowed for Ca&s;es of Re&s;erve in the Divine Providence, which often over-rules even the mo&s;t natural Connexions and Tendencies, and di&s;po&s;es them in a Method be&s;ide and above the Di&s;cour&s;es of Mens Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation may be made on tho&s;e Pre&s;ervatives that are purely Medi|cinal. They them&s;elves do not always reach the Intention, and an&s;wer the De|&s;ign. It is not the Pretence either of Di|vinity or Medicine, to give Immortality to Men in this Life, tho' the Pre&s;criptions of both may have a Tendency to Health and Welfare.</P>
<P>Some, who mind all the&s;e Pre&s;ervatives, &s;icken and die! Granted; but &s;o do they who eat and drink, exerci&s;e and change the Air, and u&s;e the be&s;t Phy&s;ic; and yet, who ever deny'd tho&s;e to be Pre&s;ervatives of Health and Life?

They are both appointed.</P>
<P>I have endeavour'd to make this Sub|ject as practical as I could, and to order the Matter &s;o, as to make the Thoughts about bodily Health, as u&s;eful as I could

<P>Take <HI>Care</HI> of your Health, &s;ince it is &s;o valuable. Make the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of it, &s;ince it is &s;o uncertain and frail. Long, pray for, and endeavour the en&s;uring of that State and World, where there is Health with|out Sickne&s;s! Eternal Health, without the lea&s;t <HI>Shadow of Death.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Take Care of it, &s;ince it is &s;o <HI>va|luable.</HI></P>
<P>If the Di&s;play of the Value and Ble&s;&s;ing of Health &s;hall make Men a little more careful of it, and more thankful for it, and more u&s;eful with it; it will add &s;omething to the Benefit and Advantage of Mankind, and the Glory of God; the only Purpo&s;es of Life, that can give a true Reli&s;h to our Being.</P>
