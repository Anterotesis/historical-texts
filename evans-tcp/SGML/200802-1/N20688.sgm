<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;equence of a partial repre&s;entation of the conduct of the people who were employed to nur&s;e the &s;ick, in the late calamitous &s;tate of the city of Philadelphia, we are &s;olicited, by a number of tho&s;e who feel them&s;elves injured thereby, and by the ad|vice of &s;everal re&s;pectable citizens, to &s;tep forward and declare facts as they really were; &s;eeing that from our &s;ituation, on account of the charge we took upon us, we had it more fully and generally in our power, to know and ob&s;erve the conduct and behavior of tho&s;e that were &s;o employed.</P>
<P>Early in September, a &s;olicitation appeared in the public papers, to the people of colour to come forward and a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, peri&s;hing, and neglected &s;ick; with a kind of a&s;&s;urance, that people of our colour were not liable to take the infection. Upon which we and a few others met and con&s;ulted how to act on &s;o truly alarming and melancholy an occa&s;ion. After &s;ome conver&s;ation, we found a freedom to go forth, confiding in him who can pre&s;erve in the mid&s;t of a burning fiery furnace, &s;en&s;ible that it was our duty to do all the good we could to our &s;uffering fellow mor|tals. We &s;et out to &s;ee where we could be u&s;eful. The fir&s;t we vi&s;ited was a man in Em&s;ley's alley, who was dying, and his wife lay dead at the time in the hou&s;e, there were none to a&s;&s;i&s;t but two poor helple&s;s children. We admini&s;tered what relief we could, and applied to the over&s;eers of the poor to have the woman buried. We vi&s;ited upwards of twenty families that
<PB N="4" REF="027170_0004_0FD3932EF39644B0">
day&mdash;they were &s;cenes of woe indeed! The Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;trengthen us, and remove all fear from us, and di&s;po&s;ed our&punc; hearts to be as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In order the better to regulate our conduct, we cal|led on the mayor next day, to con&s;ult with him how to proceed, &s;o as to be mo&s;t u&s;eful. The fir&s;t object he recommended was a &s;trict attention to the &s;ick, and the procuring of nur&s;es. This was attended to by Ab&s;a|lom Jones and William Gray; and, in order that the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed might know where to apply, the mayor ad|verti&s;ed the public that upon application to them they would be &s;upplied. Soon after, the mortality increa&s;|ing, the difficulty of getting a corp&s;e taken away, was &s;uch, that few were willing to do it, when offered great rewards. The black people were looked to. We then offered our &s;ervices in the public papers, by ad|verti&s;ing that we would remove the dead and procure nur&s;es. Our &s;ervices were the production of real &s;en|&s;ibility;&mdash;we &s;ought not fee nor reward, until the in|crea&s;e of the di&s;order rendered our labour &s;o arduous that we were not adequate to the &s;ervice we had a&s;&s;um|ed. The mortality increa&s;ing rapidly, obliged us to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of five<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two of whom were Richard Allen's brothers.</NOTE> hired men, in the awful di&s;charge of interring the dead. They with great reluctance, were prevailed upon to join us. It was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mmon, at this time, to find any one that would go near, much more, handle, a &s;ick or dead per&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Carey, in page 106 of his third edition, has ob&s;erved, that, "for the honor of human nature, it ought to be recorded, that &s;ome of the convicts in the gaol, a part of the term of who&s;e confinement had been remitted as a reward for their peaceable, orderly behavior, voluntarily offered them&s;elves as nur&s;es to attend the &s;ick at Bu&s;h-hill; and have, in that capaci|ty, conducted them&s;elves with great fidelity &amp;c. Here
<PB N="5" REF="027170_0005_0FD3933095B5FFA8">
it ought to be remarked, (although Mr. Carey hath not done it) that two thirds of the per&s;ons, who ren|dered the&s;e e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices, were people of colour, who, on the application of the elders of the African church, (who met to con&s;ider what they could do for the help of the &s;ick) were liberated, on condition of their doing the duty of nur&s;es at the ho&s;pital at Bu&s;h-|hill; which they as voluntarily accepted to do, as they did faithfully di&s;charge, this &s;evere and di&s;agreeable duty.&mdash;May the Lord reward them, both temporally and &s;piritually.</P>
<P>When the &s;ickne&s;s became general, and &s;everal of the phy&s;icians died, and mo&s;t of the &s;urvivors were ex|hau&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s or fatigue; that good man, Doctor Ru&s;h, called us more immediately to attend upon the &s;ick, knowing we could both bleed; he told us we could increa&s;e our utility, by attending to his in&s;truc|tions, and accordingly directed us where to procure medicine duly prepared, with proper directions how to admini&s;ter them, and at what &s;tages of the di&s;order to bleed; and when we found our&s;elves incapable of judging what was proper to be done, to apply to him, and he would, if able, attend them him&s;elf, or &s;end Edward Fi&s;her, his pupil, which he often did; and Mr. Fi&s;her manife&s;ted his humanity, by an affectionate at|tention for their relief.&mdash;This has been no &s;mall &s;atis|faction to us; for, we think, that when a phy&s;ician was not attainable, we have been the in&s;truments, in the hand of God, for &s;aving the lives of &s;ome hundreds of our &s;uffering fellow mortals.</P>
<P>We feel our&s;elves &s;en&s;ibly aggrieved by the cen&s;ori|ous epithets of many, who did not render the lea&s;t a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in the time of nece&s;&s;ity, yet are liberal of their cen&s;ure of us, for the prices paid for our &s;ervices, when no one knew how to make a propo&s;al to any one they wanted to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. At fir&s;t we made no charge, but left it to tho&s;e we &s;erved in removing their dead,
<PB N="6" REF="027170_0006_0FD39331EA543A38">
to give what they thought fit&mdash;we &s;et no price, until the reward was fixed by tho&s;e we had &s;erved. After paying the people we had to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, our compen&s;ation is much le&s;s than many will believe.</P>
<P>We do a&s;&s;ure the public, that <HI>all</HI> the money we have received, for burying, and for coffins which we our|&s;elves purcha&s;ed and procured, has not defrayed the expence of wages which we had to pay to tho&s;e whom we employed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us.

<P>Be&s;ides the co&s;ts of hear&s;es, the maintenance of our families for 70 days, (being the period of our labours) and the &s;upport of the five hired men, during the re|&s;pective times of their being employed; which expen|ces, together with &s;undry gifts we occa&s;ionally made to poor families, might rea&s;onably and properly be intro|duced,
<PB N="7" REF="027170_0007_0FD3933586858670">
to &s;hew our actual &s;ituation with regard to pro|fit&mdash;but it is enough to exhibit to the public, from the above &s;pecified items, of <HI>Ca&s;h paid and Ca&s;h received,</HI> without taking into view the other expences, that, by the employment we were engaged in, we have lo&s;t &pound;.177 9 8. But, if the other expences, which we have actually paid, are added to that &s;um, how much then may we not &s;ay we have &s;uffered! We leave the public to judge.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly appear &s;trange to &s;ome who know how con&s;tantly we were employed, that we &s;hould have received no more Ca&s;h than &pound;.233 10 4. But we repeat our a&s;&s;urance, that this is the fact, and we add another, which will &s;erve the better to explain it: We have buried <HI>&s;everal hundreds</HI> of poor per&s;ons and &s;trangers, for which &s;ervice we have never received, nor never a&s;ked any compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>We feel our&s;elves hurt mo&s;t by a partial, cen&s;orious paragraph, in Mr. Carey's &s;econd edition, of his ac|count of the &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. in Philadelphia; pages 76 and 77, where he a&s;per&s;es the blacks alone, for having taken the advantage of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the people. That &s;ome extravagant prices were paid, we admit; but how came they to be demanded? the rea|&s;on is plain. It was with difficulty per&s;ons could be had to &s;upply the wants of the &s;ick, as nur&s;es;&mdash;ap|plications became more and more numerous, the con&s;e|quence was, when we procured them at &s;ix dollars per week, and called upon them to go where they were wanted, we found they were gone el&s;ewhere; here was a di&s;appointment; upon enquiring the cau&s;e, we found, they had been allured away by others who of|fered greater wages, until they got from two to four dollars per day. We had no re&s;traint upon the peo|ple. It was natural for people in low circum&s;tances to accept a voluntary, bounteous reward; e&s;pecially under the loath&s;omne&s;s of many of the &s;ick, when na|ture
<PB N="8" REF="027170_0008_0FD39338B47CC868">
&s;huddered at the thoughts of the infection, and the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned was aggravated by lunacy, and being left much alone with them. Had Mr. Carey been &s;o|licited to &s;uch an undertaking, for hire, <HI>Query,</HI> "what would <HI>he</HI> have demanded? but Mr. Carey, although cho&s;en a member of that band of worthies who have &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their labours, for the relief of the &s;ick and helple&s;s&mdash;yet, quickly after his election, left them to &s;truggle with their arduous and hazardous ta&s;k, by leaving the city. 'Tis true Mr. Carey was no hireling, and had a right to flee, and upon his return, to plead the cau&s;e of tho&s;e who fled; yet, we think, he was wrong in giving &s;o partial and injurious an account of the black nur&s;es; if they have taken advantage of the public di&s;tre&s;s? Is it any more than he hath done of its de&s;ire for information. We believe he has made more money by the &s;ale of his "&s;craps" than a dozen of the greate&s;t extortioners among the black nur&s;es. The great prices paid did not e&s;cape the ob|&s;ervation of that worthy and vigilant magi&s;trate, Ma|thew Clark&s;on, mayor of the city, and pre&s;ident of the committee&mdash;he &s;ent for us, and reque&s;ted we would u&s;e our influence, to le&s;&s;en the wages of the nur&s;es, but on informing him the cau&s;e, i. e. that of the people over|bidding one another, it was concluded unnece&s;&s;ary to attempt any thing on that head; therefore it was left to the people concerned. That there were &s;ome few black people guilty of plundering the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, we acknowledge; but in that they only are pointed out, and made mention of, we e&s;teem partial and injurious; we know as many whites who were guilty of it; but this is looked over, while the blacks are held up to cen|&s;ure.&mdash;Is it a greater crime for a black to pilfer, than for a white to privateer?</P>
<P>We wi&s;h not to offend, but when an unprovoked at|tempt is made, to make us blacker than we are, it be|comes le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to be over cautious on that ac|count;
<PB N="9" REF="027170_0009_0FD3933A2BEB9760">
therefore we &s;hall take the liberty to tell of the conduct of &s;ome of the whites.</P>
<P>We know &s;ix pounds was demanded by, and paid, to a white woman, for putting a corp&s;e into a coffin; and forty dollars was demanded, and paid, to four white men, for bringing it down the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Taylor both died in one night; a white woman had the care of them; after they were dead &s;he called on Jacob Servo&s;s, <ABBR>e&s;q.</ABBR> for her pay, demanding &s;ix pounds for laying them out; upon &s;ee|ing a bundle with her, he &s;u&s;pected &s;he had pilfered; on &s;earching her, Mr. Taylor's buckles were found in her pocket, with other things.</P>
<P>An elderly lady, Mrs. Malony, was given into the care of a white woman, &s;he died, we were called to remove the corp&s;e, when we came the woman was lay|ing &s;o drunk that &s;he did not know what we were do|ing, but we know &s;he had one of Mrs. Malony's rings on her finger, and another in her pocket.</P>
<P>Mr. Carey tells us, Bu&s;h-hill exhibited as wretched a picture of human mi&s;ery, as ever exi&s;ted. A profli|gate abandoned &s;et of nur&s;es and attendants (hardly any of good character could at that time be procured,) rioted on the provi&s;ions and comforts, prepared for the &s;ick, who (unle&s;s at the hours when the doctors attend|ed) were left almo&s;t entirely de&s;titute of every a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The dying and dead were indi&s;criminately mingled together. The ordure and other evacuations of the &s;ick, were allowed to remain in the mo&s;t offen|&s;ive &s;tate imaginable. Not the &s;malle&s;t appearance of order or regularity exi&s;ted. It was in fact a great hu|man &s;laughter hou&s;e, where numerous victims were immolated at the altar of intemperance.</P>
<P>It is unplea&s;ant to point out the bad and unfeeling conduct of any colour, yet the defence we have under|taken obliges us to remark, that although "hardly any of good character at that time could be procured" yet only two black women were at this time in the ho&s;pi|tal,
<PB N="10" REF="027170_0010_0FD3933C220555D8">
and they were retained and the others di&s;charg|ed, when it was reduced to order and good govern|ment.</P>
<P>The bad con&s;equences many of our colour apprehend from a partial relation of our conduct are, that it will prejudice the minds of the people in general again&s;t us&mdash;becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible that one individual, can have knowledge of all, therefore a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome future day, when &s;ome of the mo&s;t virtuous, that were upon mo&s;t prai&s;e|worthy motives, induced to &s;erve the &s;ick, may fall in|to the &s;ervice of a family that are &s;trangers to him, or her, and it is di&s;covered that it is one of tho&s;e &s;tigmati&s;|ed wretches, what may we &s;uppo&s;e will be the con|&s;equence? Is it not rea&s;onable to think the per&s;on will be abhored, de&s;pi&s;ed, and perhaps di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from em|ployment, to their great di&s;advantage, would not this be hard? and have we not therefore &s;ufficient rea&s;on to &s;eek for redre&s;s? We can with certainty a&s;&s;ure the public that we have &s;een more humanity, more real &s;en&s;ibility from the poor blacks, than from the poor whites. When many of the former, of their own ac|cord rendered &s;ervices where extreme nece&s;&s;ity called for it, the general part of the poor white people were &s;o di&s;mayed, that in&s;tead of attempting to be u&s;eful, they in a manner hid them&s;elves&mdash;a remarkable in|&s;tance of this&mdash;A po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r afflicted dying man, &s;tood at his chamber window, praying and be&s;eeching every one that pa&s;&s;ed by, to help him to a drink of water; a num|ber of white people pa&s;&s;ed, and in&s;tead of being moved by the poor man's di&s;tre&s;s, they hurried as fa&s;t as they could out of the &s;ound of his cries&mdash;until at length a gentleman, who &s;eemed to be a foreigner came up, he could not pa&s;s by, but had not re&s;olution enough to go into the hou&s;e, he held eight dollars in his hand, and offered it to &s;everal as a reward for giving the poor man a drink of water, but was refu&s;ed by every one, until a poor black man came up, the gentleman offer|ed the eight dollars to him, if he would relieve the

poor man with a little water, "Ma&s;ter" replied the good natured fellow, "I will &s;upply the gentleman with water, but &s;urely I will not take your money for it" nor could he be prevailed upon to accept his boun|ty: he went in, &s;upplied the poor object with water, and rendered him every &s;ervice he could.</P>
<P>A poor black man, named Samp&s;on, went con&s;tantly from hou&s;e to hou&s;e where di&s;tre&s;s was, and no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance without fee or reward; he was &s;mote with the di&s;order, and died, after his death his family were neglected by tho&s;e he had &s;erved.</P>
<P>Sarah Ba&s;s, a poor black widow, gave all the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance &s;he could, in &s;everal families, for which &s;he did not receive any thing; and when any thing was offer|ed her, &s;he left it to the option of tho&s;e &s;he &s;erved.</P>
<P>A woman of our colour, nur&s;ed Richard Ma&s;on and &s;on, when they died, Richard's widow con&s;idering the ri&s;k the poor woman had run, and from ob&s;erving the fears that &s;ometimes re&s;ted on her mind, expected &s;he would have demanded &s;omething con&s;iderable, but upon a&s;king what &s;he demanded, her reply was half a dollar per day. Mrs. Ma&s;on, intimated it was not &s;ufficient for her attendance, &s;he replied it was enough for what &s;he had done, and would take no more. Mrs. Ma&s;on's feelings were &s;uch, that &s;he &s;ettled an annui|ty of &s;ix pounds a year, on her, for life. Her name is Mary Scott.</P>
<P>An elderly black woman nur&s;ed&mdash;with great diligence and attention; when recovered he a&s;ked what he mu&s;t give for her &s;ervices&mdash;&s;he replied "a din|ner ma&s;ter on a cold winter's day," and thus &s;he went from place to place rendering every &s;ervice in her pow|er without an eye to reward.</P>
<P>A young black woman, was reque&s;ted to attend one night upon a white man and his wife, who were very ill, no other per&s;on could be had;&mdash;great wages were offered her&mdash;&s;he replied, I will not go for money, if I

go for money God will &s;ee it, and may be make me take the di&s;order and die, but if I go, and take no money, he may &s;pare my life. She went about nine o'clock, and found them both on the floor; &s;he could procure no candle or other light, but &s;taid with them about two hours, and then left them. They both di|ed that night. She was afterward very ill with the fever&mdash;her life was &s;pared.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar-Cranchal, a black man, offered his &s;ervices to attend the &s;ick, and &s;aid, I will not take your mo|ney, I will not fell my life for money. It is &s;aid he died with the flux.</P>
<P>A black lad, at the Widow Gilpin's, was intru&s;ted with his young Ma&s;ter's keys, on his leaving the city, and tran&s;acted his bu&s;ine&s;s, with the greate&s;t hone&s;ty, and di&s;patch, having unloaded a ve&s;&s;el for him in the time, and loaded it again.</P>
<P>A woman, that nur&s;ed David Bacon, charged with exemplary moderation, and &s;aid &s;he would not have any more.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, in vindication of the conduct of tho&s;e, who di&s;covered ignorance or incapacity in nur&s;|ing, that it is, in it&s;elf, a con&s;iderable art, derived from experience, as well as the exerci&s;e of the finer feelings of humanity&mdash;this experience, nine tenths of tho&s;e employed, it is probable were wholly &s;tran|gers to.</P>
<P>We do not recollect &s;uch acts of humanity from the poor white people, in all the round we have been en|gaged in. We could mention many other in&s;tances of the like nature, but think it needle&s;s.</P>
<P>It is unplea&s;ant for us to make the&s;e remarks, but ju&s;tice to our colour, demands it. Mr. Carey pays William Gray and us a compliment; he &s;ays, our &s;er|vices and others of their colour, have been very great &amp;c. By naming us, he leaves the&s;e others, in the hazardous &s;tate of being cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e who are
<PB N="13" REF="027170_0013_0FD3934578265038">
called the "vile&s;t." The few that were di&s;covered to merit public cen&s;ure, were brought to ju&s;tice, which ought to have &s;ufficed, without being canva&s;&s;ed over in his "Trifle" of a pamphlet&mdash;which cau&s;es us to be more particular, and endeavour to recall the e&s;teem of the public for our friends, and the people of colour, as far as they may be found worthy; for we conceive, and experience proves it, that an ill name is ea&s;ier given than taken away. We have many unprovoked enemies, who begrudge us the liberty we enjoy, and are glad to hear of any complaint again&s;t our colour, be it ju&s;t or unju&s;t; in con&s;equence of which we are more earne&s;tly endeavouring all in our power, to warn, rebuke, and exhort our African friends, to keep a con|&s;cience void of offence towards God and man; and, at the &s;ame time, would not be backward to interfere, when &s;tigmas or oppre&s;&s;ion appear pointed at, or at|tempted again&s;t them, unju&s;tly; and, we are confident, we &s;hall &s;tand ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of the candid and judicious, for &s;uch conduct.</P>
<P>Mr. Carey's fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third editions, are gone forth into the world, and in all probability, have been read by thou&s;ands that will never read his fourth&mdash;con&s;equently, any alteration he may hereafter make, in the paragraph alluded to, cannot have the de&s;ired effect, or atone for the pa&s;t; therefore we apprehend it nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h our thoughts on the occa|&s;ion. Had Mr. Carey &s;aid, a number of white and black Wretches eagerly &s;eized on the oppor|tunity to extort from the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ome few of both were detected in plundering the &s;ick, it might extenuate, in a great degree, the having made men|tion of the blacks.</P>
<P>We can a&s;&s;ure the public, there were as many white as black people, detected in pilfering, although the number of the latter, employed as nur&s;es, was twenty times as great as the former, and that there is, in our
<PB N="14" REF="027170_0014_0FD39347A96CB0C8">
opinion, as great a proportion of white, as of black, inclined to &s;uch practices. It is rather to be admired, that &s;o few in&s;tances of pilfering and robbery happened, con&s;idering the great opportunities there were for &s;uch things: we do not know of more than five black people, &s;u&s;pected of any thing clande&s;tine, out of the great number employed; the people were glad to get any per&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t them&mdash;a black was preferred, becau&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed, they were not &s;o likely to take the di&s;order, the mo&s;t worthle&s;s were accepta|ble, &s;o that it would have been no cau&s;e of wonder, if twenty cau&s;e of complaint occurred, for one that hath. It has been alledged, that many of the &s;ick, were neglected by the nur&s;es; we do not wonder at it, con&s;idering their &s;ituation, in many in&s;tances, up night and day, without any one to relieve them, worn down with fatigue, and want of &s;leep, they could not in many ca&s;es, render that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was need|ful: where we vi&s;ited, the cau&s;es of complaint on this &s;core, were not numerous. The ca&s;e of the nur&s;es, in many in&s;tances, were de&s;erving of commi&s;eration, the patient raging and frightful to behold; it has fre|quently required two per&s;ons, to hold them from run|ing away, others have made attempts to jump out of a window, in many chambers they were nailed down, and the door was kept locked, to prevent them from running away, or breaking their necks, others lay vo|miting blood, and &s;creaming enough to chill them with horror. Thus were many of the nur&s;es circum&s;tanced, alone, until the patient died, then called away to an|other &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, and thus have been for a week or ten days left to do the be&s;t they could without any &s;ufficient re&s;t, many of them having &s;ome of their deare&s;t connections &s;ick at the time, and &s;uffering for want, while their hu&s;band, wife, father, mother, &amp;c. have been engaged in the &s;ervice of the white people. We mention this to &s;hew the difference between this
<PB N="15" REF="027170_0015_0FD3934DB3FB9248">
and nur&s;ing in common ca&s;es, we have &s;uffered equal|ly with the whites, our di&s;tre&s;s hath been very great, but much unknown to the white people. Few have been the whites that paid attention to us while the black were engaged in the other's &s;ervice. We can a&s;&s;ure the public we have taken four and five black people in a day to be buried. In &s;everal in&s;tances when they have been &s;eized with the &s;ickne&s;s while nur&s;ing, they have been turned out of the hou&s;e, and wandering and de&s;titute until taking &s;helter wherever they could (as many of them would not be admitted to their former homes) they have langui&s;hed alone and we know of one who even died in a &s;table. Others acted with more tenderne&s;s, when their nur&s;es were taken &s;ick they had proper care taken of them at their hou&s;es. We know of two in&s;tances of this.</P>
<P>It is even to this day a generally received opinion in this city, that our colour was not &s;o liable to the &s;ickne&s;s as the whites. We hope our friends will par|don us for &s;etting this matter in its true &s;tate.</P>
<P>The public were informed that in the We&s;t-Indies and other places where this terrible malady had been, it was ob&s;erved the blacks were not affected with it. Happy would it have been for you, and much more &s;o for us, if this ob&s;ervation had been verified by our experience.</P>
<P>When the people of colour had the &s;ickne&s;s and died, we were impo&s;ed upon and told it was not with the prevailing &s;ickne&s;s, until it became too notorious to be denied, then we were told &s;ome few died but not many. Thus were our &s;ervices extorted <HI>at the peril of our lives,</HI> yet you accu&s;e us of extorting <HI>a little money from you.</HI></P>
<P>The bill of mortality for the year 1793, publi&s;hed by Matthew Whitehead, and John Ormrod, clerks, and Jo&s;eph Dolby, &s;exton, will convince any rea&s;on|able man that will examine it, that as many coloured people died in proportion as others. In 1792, there
<PB N="16" REF="027170_0016_0FD3934F4C058B90">
were 67 of our colour buried, and in 1793 it amount|ed to 305; thus the burials among us have increa&s;ed more than fourfold, was not this in a great degree the effects of the &s;ervices of the inju&s;tly vilified black people?</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be acceptable to the reader to know how we found the &s;ick affected by the &s;ickne&s;s; our opportunities of hearing and &s;eeing them have been very great. They were taken with a chill, a head|ach, a &s;ick &s;tomach, with pains in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> limbs and back, this was the way the &s;ickne&s;s in general began, but all were not affected alike, &s;ome appeared but &s;lightly affected with &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ymptoms, what confirmed us in the opinion of a per&s;on being mitten was the co|lour of their eyes. In &s;ome it raged more furiou&s;ly than in others&mdash;&s;ome have langui&s;hed for &s;even and ten days, and appeared to get better the day, or &s;ome hours before they died, while others were cut off in one, two, or three days, but their complaints were &s;i|milar. Some lo&s;t their rea&s;on and raged with all the fury madne&s;s could produce, and died in &s;trong con|vul&s;ions. Others retained their rea&s;on to the la&s;t, and &s;eemed rather to fall a&s;leep than die. We could not help remarking that the former were of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and the latter of a mild temper. Numbers died in a kind of dejection, they concluded they mu&s;t go. (&s;o the phra&s;e for dying was) and therefore in a kind of fixed determined &s;tate of mind went off.</P>
<P>It &s;truck our minds with awe, to have application made by tho&s;e in health, to take charge of them in their &s;ickne&s;s, and of their funeral. Such applications have been made to us; many appeared as though they thought they mu&s;t die, and not live; &s;ome have lain on the floor, to be mea&s;ured for their coffin and grave. A gentleman called one evening, to reque&s;t a good nur&s;e might be got for him, when he was &s;ick, and to &s;uperintend his funeral, and gave particular directions
<PB N="17" REF="027170_0017_0FD393512F36B350">
how he would have it conducted, it &s;eemed a &s;urpri|&s;ing circum&s;tance, for the man appeared at the time, to be in perfect health, but calling two or three days af|ter to &s;ee him, found a woman dead in the hou&s;e, and the man &s;o far gone, that to admini&s;ter any thing for his recovery, was needle&s;s&mdash;he died that evening. We mention this, as an in&s;tance of the dejection and de&s;pondence, that took hold on the minds of thou&s;ands, and are of opinion, it aggravated the ca&s;e of many, while others who bore up chearfully, got up again, that probably would otherwi&s;e have died.</P>
<P>When the mortality came to its greate&s;t &s;tage, it was impo&s;&s;ible to procure &s;ufficient a&s;&s;i&s;tance, there|fore many who&s;e friends, and relations had left them, died un&s;een, and una&s;&s;i&s;ted. We have found them in va|rious &s;ituations, &s;ome laying on the floor, as bloody as if they had been dipt in it, without any appearance of their having had, even a drink of water for their re|lief; others laying on a bed with their clothes on, as if they had came in fatigued, and lain down to re&s;t; &s;ome appeared, as if they had fallen dead on the floor, from the po&s;ition we found them in.</P>
<P>Truly our ta&s;k was hard, yet through mercy, we were enabled to go on.</P>
<P>One thing we ob&s;erved in &s;everal in&s;tances&mdash;when we were called, on the fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;order to bleed, the per&s;on frequently, on the opening a vein before the operation was near over, felt a change for the better, and expre&s;&s;ed a relief in their chief com|plaints; and we made it a practice to take more blood from them, than is u&s;ual in other ca&s;es; the&s;e in a general way recovered; tho&s;e who did omit bleeding any con&s;iderable time, after being taken by the &s;ick|ne&s;s, rarely expre&s;&s;ed any change they felt in the ope|ration.</P>
<P>We feel a great &s;atisfaction in believing, that we have been u&s;eful to the &s;ick, and thus publicly thank
<PB N="18" REF="027170_0018_0FD39352767C74B0">
Doctor Ru&s;h, for enabling us to be &s;o. We have bled upwards of eight hundred people, and do declare, we have not received to the value of a dollar and a half, therefor: we were willing to imitate the Doctor's be|nevolence, who &s;ick or well, kept his hou&s;e open day and night, to give what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could in this time of trouble.</P>
<P>Several affecting in&s;tances occurred, when we were engaged in burying the dead. We have been called to bury &s;ome, who when we came, we found alive; at other places we found a parent dead, and none but little innocent babes to be &s;een, who&s;e ignorance led them to think their parent was a&s;leep; on account of their &s;ituation, and their little prattle, we have been &s;o wounded and our feelings &s;o hurt, that we almo&s;t concluded to withdraw from our undertaking, but &s;ee|ing others &s;o backward, we &s;till went on.</P>
<P>An affecting in&s;tance.&mdash;A woman died, we were &s;ent for to bury her, on our going into the hou&s;e and taking the coffin in, a dear little innocent acco&s;ted us, with, mamma is a&s;leep, don't wake her; but when &s;he &s;aw us puther in the coffin, 'the di&s;tre&s;s of the child was &s;o great, that it almo&s;t overcame us; when &s;he de|manded why we put her mamma in the box? We did not know how to an&s;wer her, but committed her to the care of a neighbour, and left her with heavy hearts. In other places where we have been to take the corp&s;e of a parent, and have found a group of lit|tle ones alone, &s;ome of them in a mea&s;ure capable of knowing their &s;ituation, their cries and the innocent confu&s;ions of the little ones, &s;eemed almo&s;t too much for human nature to bear. We have picked up little children that were wandering they knew not where, who&s;e (parents were cut off) and taken them to the orphan hou&s;e, for at this time the dread that prevail|ed over people's minds was &s;o general, that it was a rare in&s;tance to &s;ee one neighbour vi&s;it another, and
<PB N="19" REF="027170_0019_0FD39355EDB57250">
even friends when they met in the &s;treets were afraid of each other, much le&s;s would they admit into their hou&s;es the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed orphan that had been where the &s;ickne&s;s was; this extreme &s;eemed in &s;ome in&s;tances to have the appearance of barbarity; with reluctance we call to mind the many opportunities there were in the power of individuals to be u&s;eful to their fellow-men, yet through the terror of the times was omitted. A black man riding through the &s;treet, &s;aw a man pu&s;h a wo|man out of the hou&s;e, the woman &s;taggered and fell on her face in the gutter, and was not able to turn her&s;elf, the black man thought &s;he was drunk, but ob&s;erving &s;he was in danger of &s;uffocation alighted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd&punc;taking the woman up found her perfectly &s;ober, out &s;o far gone with the di&s;order that &s;he was not able to help her&s;elf; the hard hearted man that threw her down, &s;hut the door and left her&mdash;in &s;uch a &s;ituation, &s;he might have peri&s;hed in a few minutes: we heard of it, and took her to Bu&s;h-hill. Many of the white people, that ought to be patterns for us to follow af|ter, have acted in a manner that would make humani|ty &s;hudder. We remember an in&s;tance of cruelty, which we tru&s;t, no black man would be guilty of: two &s;i&s;ters orderly, decent, white women were &s;ick with the fever, one of them recovered &s;o as to come to the door; a neighbouring white man &s;aw her, and in an angry tone a&s;ked her if her &s;i&s;ter was dead or not? She an&s;wered no, upon which he replied, damn her, if &s;he don't die before morning, I will make her die. The poor woman &s;hocked at &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, from this mon&s;ter of a man, made a mode&s;t reply, upon which he &s;natched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p a tub of water, and would have da&s;hed it over her, if he had not been prevented by a black man; he then went and took a couple of fowls out of a coop, (which had been given them for nou|ri&s;hment) and threw them into an open alley; he had his wi&s;h, the poor woman that he would make die,
<PB N="20" REF="027170_0020_0FD39358CDB5AC90">
died that night. A white man threatened to &s;hoot us, i&s;&s;ue pa&s;&s;ed by his hou&s;e with a corp&s;e: we buried him three days after.</P>
<P>We have been pained to &s;ee the widows come to us, crying and wringing their hands, and in very great di&s;tre&s;s, on account of their hu&s;bands' death; having nobody to help them, they were obliged to come to get their hu&s;bands buried, their neighbours were afraid to go to their help or to condole with them; we a&s;cribe &s;uch unfriendly conduct to the frailty of human nature, and not to wilful unkindne&s;s, or hardne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the compliment Mr. Carey hath paid us, we have found reports &s;pread, of our taking between one, and two hundred beds, from hou&s;es where people died; &s;uch &s;landerers as the&s;e, who propagate &s;uch wilful lies are dangerous, although unworthy no|tice. We wi&s;h if any per&s;on hath the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of us, they would endeavour to bring us to the puni&s;h|ment which &s;uch atrocious conduct mu&s;t de&s;erve; and by this means, the innocent will be cleared from re|proach, and the guilty known.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now conclude with the following old pro|verb, which we think applicable to tho&s;e of our colour who expo&s;ed their lives in the late afflicting di&s;pen&s;a|tion:&mdash;
<Q><L>God and a &s;oldier, all men do adore,</L>

<P>We buried two belonging to Samuel Fi&s;her, mer|chant; one of them was taken up by us, to carry a &s;ick per&s;on on to Bu&s;h-hill, and there left; the other was buried in a grave, under a corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Two beds were buried for Thomas Willing, one &s;ix feet deep in his garden, and lime and water thrown upon it; the other was in the Potter's field, and fur|ther knowledge of it we have not.</P>

<P>THE judicious part of mankind will think it un|rea&s;onable, that a &s;uperior good conduct is looked for, from our race, by tho&s;e who &s;tigmatize us as men, who&s;e ba&s;ene&s;s is incurable, and may therefore be held in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, that a merciful man would not doom a bea&s;t to; yet you try what you can to prevent our ri&s;ing from the &s;tate of barbari&s;m, you repre&s;ent us to be in, but we can tell you, from a degree of ex|perience, that a black man, although reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate human nature is capable of, &s;hort of real madne&s;s, can think, reflect, and feel injuries, al|though it may not be with the &s;ame degree of keen re&s;entment and revenge, that you who have been and

are our great oppre&s;&s;ors, would manife&s;t if reduced to the pitiable condition of a &s;lave. We believe if you would try the experiment of taking a few black chil|dren, and cultivate their minds with the &s;ame care, and let them have the &s;ame pro&s;pect in view, as to living in the world, as you would wi&s;h for your own children, you would find upon the trial, they were not inferior in mental endowments.</P>
<P>We do not wi&s;h to make you angry, but excite your attention to con&s;ider, how hateful &s;lavery is in the &s;ight of that God, who hath de&s;troyed kings and princes, for their oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor &s;laves; Pha|raoh and his princes with the po&s;terity of king Saul, were de&s;troyed by the protector and avenger of &s;laves.

Their hi&s;tory &s;hews how &s;lavery had deba&s;ed their &s;pirits.

The meek and humble Je&s;us, the great pattern of humanity, and every other virtue that can adorn and dignify men, hath command|ed to love our enemies, to do good to them that hate and de&s;pitefully u&s;e us. We feel the obligations, we wi&s;h to impre&s;s them on the minds of our black bre|thren, and that we may all forgive you, as we wi&s;h to be forgiven; we think it a great mercy to have all anger and bitterne&s;s removed from our minds; we appeal to your own feelings, if it is not very di&s;quiet|ing to feel your&s;elves under the dominion of a wrath|ful di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>If you love your children, if you love your country, if you love the God of love, clear your hands from &s;laves, burden not your children or country with them. Our hearts have been &s;orrowful for the late blood&s;hed of the oppre&s;&s;ors, as well as the oppre&s;&s;ed, both ap|pear guilty of each others blood, in the &s;ight of him who &s;aid, he that &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed.</P>
<P>Will you, becau&s;e you have reduced us to the un|happy condition our colour is in, plead our incapacity for freedom, and our contented condition under op|pre&s;&s;ion, as a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for keeping us under the grievous yoke? We have &s;hewn the cau&s;e of our inca|pacity, we will al&s;o &s;hew, why we appear contented; were we to attempt to plead with our ma&s;ters, it would be deemed in&s;olence, for which cau&s;e they appear as contented as they can in your fight, but the dreadful in&s;urrections they have made, when opportunity has offered, is enough to convince a rea&s;onable man, that great unea&s;ine&s;s and not contentment, is the inhabitant of their hearts.</P>
<P>God him&s;elf hath pleaded their cau&s;e, he hath from time to time rai&s;ed up in&s;truments for that purpo&s;e, &s;ometimes mean and contemptible in your &s;ight; at o|ther times he hath u&s;ed &s;uch as it hath plea&s;ed him,

with whom you have not thought it beneath your dig|nity to contend, many have been convinced of their error, condemned their former conduct, and become zealous advocates for the cau&s;e of tho&s;e, whom you will not &s;uffer to plead for them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>To the People of Colour.</HEAD>
<P>FEELING an engagement of mind for your welfare, we addre&s;s you with an affectionate &s;ympathy, having been our&s;elves &s;laves, and as de&s;irous of freedom as any of you; yet the bands of bondage were &s;o &s;trong, that no way appeared for our relea&s;e, yet at times a hope aro&s;e in our hearts that a way would open for it, and when our minds were mercifully vi&s;ited with the feeling of the love of God, then the&s;e hopes increa&s;ed, and a confidence aro&s;e that he would make way for our enlargement, and as a patient waiting was nece&s;&s;ary, we were &s;ometimes favoured with it, at other times we were very impatient, then the pro&s;|pect of liberty almo&s;t vani&s;hed away, and we were in dark|ne&s;s and perplexity.</P>
<P>We mention our experience to you, that your hearts may not &s;ink at the di&s;couraging pro&s;pects you may have, and that you may put your tru&s;t in God, who &s;ees your condition, and as a merciful father pitieth his children, &s;o doth God pity them that love him; and as your hearts are inclined to &s;erve God, you will feel an affectionate regard towards your ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and the whole family where you live, this will be &s;een by them, and tend to promote your liberty, e&s;pecially with &s;uch as have feeling ma&s;ters, and if they are otherwi&s;e you will have the favour and love of God dwell|ing in your hearts, which you will value more than any thing el&s;e, which will be a con&s;olation in the wor&s;t conditi|on you can be in, and no ma&s;ter can deprive you of it; and as life is &s;hort and uncertain, and the chief end of our hav|ing a being in this world, is to be prepared for a better, we wi&s;h you to think of this more than any thing el&s;e: then will you have a view of that freedom which the &s;ons of God enjoy; and if the troubles of your condition end with your lives, you will be admitted to the freedom which God hath prepared for tho&s;e of all colours that love him; here the

power of the mo&s;t cruel ma&s;ter ends, and all &s;orrow and tears are wiped away.</P>
<P>To you who are favoured with freedom; let your conduct manife&s;t your gratitude toward the compa&s;&s;ionate ma&s;ters who have &s;et you free, and let no rancour or ill-will lodge in your brea&s;ts for any bad treatment you may have receiv|ed from any; if you do, you tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t God, who will not hold you guiltle&s;s, he would not &s;uffer it even in his beloved people I&s;rael, and can you think he will allow it unto us?</P>
<P>There is much gratitude due from our colour towards the white people, very many of them are in&s;truments in the hand of God for our good, even &s;uch as have held us in cap|tivity, are now pleading our cau&s;e with earne&s;tne&s;s and zeal; and we are &s;orry to &s;ay, that too many think more of the evil, than of the good they have received, and in|&s;tead of taking the advice of their friends, turn from it with indifference; much depends upon us for the help of our co|lour more than many are aware; if we are lazy and idle, the enemies of freedom plead it as a cau&s;e why we ought not to be free, and &s;ay we are better in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, and that giving us our liberty would be an injury to us, and by &s;uch conduct we &s;terngthen the bands of oppre&s;&s;ion, and keep many in bondage who are more worthy than our&s;elves; we intreat you to con&s;ider the obligations we lay under, to help forward the cau&s;e of freedom, we who know how bitter the cup is of which the &s;lave hath to drink, O how ought we to feel for tho&s;e who yet remain in bondage? Will even our friends excu&s;e, will God pardon us, for the part we act in making &s;trong the hands of the enemies of our colour.</P>

<P>WE feel an inexpre&s;&s;ible gratitude towards you, who have engaged in the cau&s;e of the African race; you have wrought a deliverance for many, from more than E|gyptian bondage, your labours are unremitted for their complete redemption, from the cruel &s;ubjection they are in. You feel our afflictions&mdash;you &s;ympathize with us in the heart-rending di&s;tre&s;s, when the hu&s;band is &s;eparated from the wife, and the parents from the children, who are never more to meet in this world.

&mdash;Your righteous indignation is rou&s;ed at the means taken to &s;upply the place of the murdered babe. You &s;ee our race more effectually de&s;troyed, than was in Pharaoh's power to effect, upon I&s;rael's &s;ons; you blow the trumpet again&s;t the mighty evil, you make the tyrants tremble; you &s;trive to rai&s;e the &s;lave, to the dignity of a man; you take our children by the hand, to lead them in the path of vir|tue, by your care of their education; you are not a&s;hamed to call the mo&s;t abject of our race, brethren, children of one father, who made of one blood all the nations of the earth: You a&s;k for this, nothing for your&s;elves, nothing but what is worthy the cau&s;e you are engaged in; nothing but that we would be friends to our&s;elves, and not &s;trengthen the bands of oppre&s;&s;ion, by an evil conduct, when led out of the hou&s;e of bondage. May he, who hath ari&s;en to plead our cau&s;e, and engaged you as volunteers in the &s;ervice, add to your numbers, until the princes &s;hall come forth from Egypt, and Ethiopia &s;tretch out her hand unto God.</P>
