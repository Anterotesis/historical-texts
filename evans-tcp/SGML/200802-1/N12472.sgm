<BIBL>JOSHUA VII. 13.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;"Thus &s;aith the Lord God of I&s;rael, there is an accur&s;ed thing in the mid&s;t of thee, O I&s;rael! Thou can&s;t not &s;tand be|fore thine enemies, until ye take away the accur&s;ed thing from among you."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE preceeding chapter gave us an account of <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s be&s;ieging <HI>Jericho,</HI> and of the fal|ling of the walls of that fenced city by a mar|vellous di&s;play of the power of almighty God: Upon which it is added in the clo&s;e of the chapter, "So the Lord was with Jo&s;hua, and his fame was noi&s;ed throughout all the country." And yet, one of the fir&s;t things we are acquainted with in the progre&s;s of his hi&s;tory is, the defeat he met with in his attempt again&s;t <HI>Ai,</HI> a city about nine miles we&s;t from <HI>Jericho.</HI> This unhappy defeat filled <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> with great concern, in&s;omuch that he "rent his cloaths, fell upon his face before the Lord, and put du&s;t upon his head, continu|ing all day in fa&s;ting and prayer." The words of his prayer we have in the 7th, 8th and 9th ver&s;es of the context.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015759_0004_0F9A28DA290CB290">
The good God &s;aw the &s;incerity of this prayer, notwith&s;tanding the imperfections that attended it, and lets <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> into the true rea&s;on why <HI>I&s;rael</HI> fled before their enemies. Says he, in the 11th and 12th ver&s;es, "I&s;rael hath &s;inned&mdash;they have even taken of the accur&s;ed thing&mdash;therefore they could not &s;tand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, becau&s;e they were accur&s;ed: neither will I be with you any more, unle&s;s ye remove the accur&s;ed thing from among you." And now come in the words of my text, "Thus &s;aith the Lord God of I&s;rael, there is an accur&s;ed thing in the mid&s;t of thee, O I&s;rael! Thou can&s;t not &s;tand before thine enemies until ye take away the accur&s;ed thing from among you." The <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> in the mid&s;t of I&s;rael was <HI>Achan'</HI>s &s;in, ver&s;e 20, 21.</P>
<P>It would not be unprofitable, &s;hould I enlarge in de&s;cribing this &s;in, and tho&s;e circum&s;tances relative to it, which made it &s;o provoking to God; and al&s;o in vindicating that awful, but righteous &s;everity with which it was puni&s;hed. But to do this as it ought to be done, would take up too much of the pre&s;ent time; for which rea&s;on I &s;hall pa&s;s over all that might be &s;aid upon the&s;e points, and immediately proceed to employ your thoughts on the text it&s;elf; from which the following notes are obviou&s;ly deducible.</P>

I. Sin is an <HI>accur&s;ed thing.</HI> So it is &s;tigmatized by God him&s;elf in the text; and with the highe&s;t rea&s;on.</P>
<P>For 'tis an accur&s;ed thing in its own <HI>nature.</HI> What this is we may learn from the de&s;cription which an Apo&s;tle has given us of it, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 4. "Who&s;o|ever committeth &s;in, tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth al&s;o the law: for &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law." i. e. the law of God, however made known, whether by the light of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> or the <HI>revelation</HI> he has made of his will in the &s;crip|tures of the old and new te&s;tament. Mankind are all under the law of God, in one or other, or both of the&s;e &s;en&s;es; and when they tran&s;gre&s;s this law, they are chargeable with &s;in. This is its <HI>nature.</HI></P>
<P>And it carries in its idea <HI>rebellion</HI> again&s;t the mo&s;t <HI>rightful authority.</HI> For nothing is more indi&s;putable than that the God who made us is our <HI>&s;overeign,</HI> and has a right to give law to us, and demand our &s;ub|jection. But by &s;in we practically call in que&s;tion this right of his, and reflect di&s;honor on his governing authority. And what is this &s;hort of rebellion again&s;t the mo&s;t &s;overeign maje&s;ty, who&s;e authority carries with it the mo&s;t binding force, the mo&s;t indubitable obligation?</P>
<P>It implies in it al&s;o horrid contempt of God, and the mo&s;t &s;lighty regard to him. The language of it is, that his laws are not worth minding; that he either knows not how, or has not taken care, to make laws that are fit to be regarded; and that men can govern them&s;elves much better than they will be governed by an ob&s;ervance of the divine precepts. This is the practical language of &s;in, whereby the
<PB N="8" REF="015759_0006_0F9A28DBAAEDFD80">
wi&s;dom of God is reflected upon, and the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty him&s;elf treated with contempt.</P>
<P>Moreover, &s;in practically defies the power and anger of God; for his laws are guarded with &s;anctions which are awfully &s;evere. He has declared he will arm him&s;elf with power, and take vengeance on tho&s;e who obey not the truth, but unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. And therefore to violate the laws of God, and to go on in a cour&s;e of doing &s;o, is a practical declaration that we regard not the anger of God, nor fear what he has threatned to bring upon us. The language of &s;in is, that we are &s;tronger than the Almighty; at lea&s;t, that we are not afraid of his power, or his wrath. All this is included in &s;in, on which account it may, with the highe&s;t propriety, be called an <HI>accur&s;ed thing.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is &s;in an <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> in its nature only, but in its <HI>effects</HI> and <HI>con&s;equences</HI> al&s;o. It has proved a cur&s;e, and the mo&s;t dreadful one by its mi&s;chievous effects.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;in that has <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> the <HI>ground,</HI> &s;o that it brings forth thorns and thi&s;tles, and obliges mankind to toil and pains to get a livelihood out of it. The cur&s;e of God upon the ground, by means of &s;in, is pro|nounced, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 17, 18, 19.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;in that has brought a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> upon our <HI>bodies,</HI> &s;ubjecting them to di&s;ea&s;es and pains, infinitely va|rious both for kind and degree; yea, expo&s;ing them to death, in all manner of forms. The words of the cur&s;e are recorded, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 19.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;in that has brought a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> upon our <HI>&s;ouls,</HI> introducing into them confu&s;ion and di&s;order, weak|ne&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="015759_0007_0F9A28DC68A5AB90">
and depravity. 'Tis this that has blinded our under&s;tandings, perverted our judgments, &s;tupified our con&s;ciences, corrupted our pa&s;&s;ions and affections. 'Tis this that has deprived us of our original glory, &s;unk our natures, and from creatures but little lower than the angels, reduced us to a level with the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. 'Tis this that has commenced a war in our faculties, di&s;turbing the peace of our minds, and filling them with tumult and vexation, inte&s;tine jars and horrid inward recoilings.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;in that has brought a cur&s;e upon this whole lower world, filling it, in all ages, with innumerable &s;pectacles of woe and mi&s;ery. 'Tis this that opened the door to all that grief and &s;orrow, di&s;tre&s;s and trouble, in infinitely various kinds, which has made mankind unhappy, even from the days of Adam, whether as &s;ingle per&s;ons, or as &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in &s;ocieties, whether &s;maller or greater.</P>
<P>'Tis this that has harra&s;&s;ed &s;o many particular individual per&s;ons, perplexing their minds, afflicting their bodies, and creating numberle&s;s unea&s;ine&s;&s;es to them, in all the different &s;hapes that can be conceived of by the livelie&s;t imagination.</P>
<P>'Tis this that has di&s;quieted families, introducing di&s;appointments, lo&s;&s;es, cro&s;&s;es, feuds and animo&s;ities, the want of outward good things, and the &s;uffering a thou&s;and evil ones.</P>
<P>'Tis this that has ever been the <HI>make-bate</HI> in the church of God, de&s;troying its peace and order,
<PB N="10" REF="015759_0008_0F9A28DD5BA68978">
promoting &s;trife and contention, alienation and di&s;|affection, and crumbling it into numberle&s;s parties.</P>
<P>'Tis this that has been the troubler of nations and kingdoms, un&s;heathing the &s;word and making them the devourers of one another. 'Tis this that has dethroned princes, ruined cities, depopulated coun|tries, yea, emptied the earth of its inhabitants, filling it with &s;laughter and blood&s;hed. And 'tis this al&s;o that has "&s;hut up the heavens, and made the rain of a land powder and du&s;t"; 'tis this that has brought "the pe&s;tilence that walketh in darkne&s;s, and de|&s;truction that wa&s;teth at noon day"; 'tis this that has cau&s;ed the earth to tremble, and open its mouth &s;o as to take in thou&s;ands of &s;ouls at once: Yea, whenever the judgments of God have been abroad in the earth, 'tis &s;in that has brought them down: To this mu&s;t they all be attributed as the alone procuring cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e dreadful calamities the wor&s;t effects of this <HI>accur&s;ed thing.</HI> Its malign influence extends beyond the grave, and reaches even to the eternal world. 'Tis this that guards the heavenly paradi&s;e as with a flaming &s;word, &s;o that there is no admi&s;&s;ion for &s;inners, continuing &s;uch, into that ble&s;&s;ed place: As the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, "there &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into it any thing that defileth, neither what&s;oever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie." Nor is this the wor&s;t effect of &s;in yet. 'Tis this that has made the dreadful place in the other world called in &s;cripture <HI>hell;</HI> the <HI>bottomle&s;s pit;</HI> the <HI>lake that burneth with fire and brim&s;tone;</HI> the <HI>place of
<PB N="11" REF="015759_0009_0F9A28DE95494F70">
blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s, of weeping and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI> If it had not been for &s;in, there had never been &s;uch a place as <HI>hell;</HI> we &s;hould never have heard of <HI>the &s;ire that goeth not out,</HI> and the <HI>worm that dieth not.</HI></P>
<P>But I need not &s;ay any thing more to &s;atisfy you that &s;in is an <HI>accur&s;ed thing.</HI> That is certainly wor|thy to be &s;poken of in this &s;tile, which has brought mankind under the cur&s;e of God in this world, and expo&s;es them to his cur&s;e in the future one. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is of all things the <HI>mo&s;t accur&s;ed.</HI> There is indeed a cur&s;e in nothing but by means of &s;in. This is em|phatically the <HI>accur&s;ed thing.</HI> And whatever el&s;e has a cur&s;e in it, is derived from &s;in.</P>
<P>Let us, my brethren, take care to make a ju&s;t e&s;timate of &s;in; not looking upon it as an harmle&s;s innocent thing, not entertaining an opinion of it as a &s;light incon&s;iderable evil; but as that which is accur&s;ed in it&s;elf, and carries with it all manner of cur&s;es. We mu&s;t thus conceive of it. 'Tis the fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary to a deliverance from the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> it has &s;ubjected us to; as it will not only engage us in the work of repentance, but open to our view our infi|nite indebtedne&s;s to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has taken upon him the cur&s;e of &s;in. And this will in|&s;pire us with zeal and vigor, in the u&s;e of all means, that we may obtain, through him, redemption from the cur&s;e of the law and the wrath of God.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not enlarge. 'Tis time that I proceed to the &s;econd note from the text, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="015759_0010_0F9A28DEA8CF8668">
II. That &s;in, this <HI>accur&s;ed thing,</HI> is too often in the mid&s;t of a people, when engaged in war.</P>
<P>This was the charge again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> now they were gone forth again&s;t the nations of <HI>Canaan.</HI> Says the context, "I&s;rael hath committed a tre&s;pa&s;s in the <HI>accur&s;ed thing.</HI> I&s;rael hath &s;inned and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed my covenant." Nor was this the only time they were chargeable with &s;in, while engaged in war. We never read of this people, when in a &s;tate of war, but they are complained of as having &s;inned again&s;t the Lord their God. And there are &s;carce any &s;ins but they were prevalent among them. The <HI>Pro|phets,</HI> whom God &s;ent with his me&s;&s;ages to them, te&s;tify again&s;t their profanene&s;s, their covetou&s;ne&s;s, their uncleanne&s;s, their pride, their hypocri&s;y, their idolatry, and &s;ometimes their univer&s;al debauchery of manners. And it was indeed the prevalence of the&s;e and &s;uch like &s;ins that engaged them in war, either putting them upon invading the rights of their neighbours, or provoking God to &s;tir up their neigh|bours to invade theirs. It would be needle&s;s to go over the <HI>wars of I&s;rael,</HI> as they are recorded in the old te&s;tament, to illu&s;trate this; but if any &s;hould chu&s;e to be at this pains, they would find that their <HI>moral</HI> character was always &s;uch as might ju&s;tly give the holy God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to complain of them, as in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> i. 4. "Ah! &s;inful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a &s;eed of evil doers; they have for&s;aken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of I&s;rael to anger."</P>
<P>And is it true of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> only, that the <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> was in the mid&s;t of them when engaged
<PB N="13" REF="015759_0011_0F9A28DF68F01E28">
in war? Is not this the charge that may be ju&s;tly made again&s;t our land at this day?&mdash;Was it ever in a more corrupt and degenerate &s;tate? Was it ever in a more unhappy &s;ituation, <HI>morally</HI> &s;peaking, to en|gage in war? Did we ever hear &s;o loud a cry of op|pre&s;&s;ion? Was common hone&s;ty ever at a lower ebb? Were extravagance, intemperance and lewdne&s;s ever more general? Were the &s;abbaths of the Lord ever more prophaned, or his &s;anctuary more polluted? Was the name of God ever more di&s;honored by horrid cur&s;ing and &s;wearing?&mdash;We are, in truth, a &s;inful people, and have exceedingly provoked the holy one of I&s;rael to anger again&s;t us. The <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> is in the mid&s;t of us, impiety towards God, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and unmercifulne&s;s towards our neighbour, and in&s;obriety with re&s;pect to our &s;elves; yea, we have di&s;honored Chri&s;t, neglected his &s;alva|tion, abu&s;ed his grace, and grieved his &s;pirit. This, in <HI>general,</HI> though I am grieved to &s;ay it, is the true character of the country, at this day, notwith&s;tanding all our pretences, and all our &s;piritual advantages. A melancholy illu&s;tration of the truth we were up|on, that the <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> is too often in the mid&s;t of a people when at war with their enemies. I now go on to the next and la&s;t note from the words, viz.</P>
<P>III. That a people at war mu&s;t take away the accur&s;ed thing from among them, if they would hope, upon ju&s;t grounds, to &s;tand before their enemies.</P>
<P>You &s;ee that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> could not &s;tand before the men of <HI>Ai:</HI> And what was the rea&s;on? 'Tis given to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> by God him&s;elf, ver. 11, 12. "I&s;rael hath
<PB N="14" REF="015759_0012_0F9A28E0299C09E0">
&s;inned&mdash;therefore the children of I&s;rael could not &s;tand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies." And this is but agreeable to the <HI>covenant</HI> which God made with them, after he had brought them out of <HI>Egypt</HI> with a mighty hand and an out-&s;tretched arm. Tho&s;e are the terms of it. "If ye walk in my &s;tatutes and keep my commandments, and do them;&mdash;then ye &s;hall cha&s;e your enemies, and they &s;hall fall before you by the &s;word. But if ye will not hearken unto me, and &s;hall de&s;pi&s;e my &s;tatutes, and not do my command|ments;&mdash;I al&s;o will do this unto you, ye &s;hall be &s;lain before your enemies, ye &s;hall be delivered into the hand of the enemy." <HI>Lev.</HI> xxvi. And according to the tenor of this <HI>covenant,</HI> it all along happened to <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> While they kept them&s;elves from the <HI>ac|cur&s;ed thing,</HI> or &s;oon took it away, they had the better of their enemies, and cau&s;ed them to <HI>flee</HI> or <HI>fall</HI> before them: But when the <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> was in the mid&s;t of them, and they took no care to re|move it away, they fell before their enemies, or run from them, or were delivered into their hands. And as an awful illu&s;tration of the truth of my text, and of the threatning contained in God's <HI>covenant</HI> with <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they were, about forty years after our Saviour, invaded by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and totally broken up as a people, and &s;cattered among all the nations of the earth, among whom they remain as a taunt and a cur&s;e to this very day.</P>
<P>And God will deal, in general, after the &s;ame manner, with other people, as he dealt with his <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> While they walk with him, and do that which is right and ju&s;t and good, he will make their
<PB N="15" REF="015759_0013_0F9A28E0E97DD768">
enemies to be at peace with them, or deliver them into their hands: But if they violate the law of God, and <HI>tre&s;pa&s;s in the accur&s;ed thing,</HI> he will not enable them to &s;tand before their enemies, but will give them into their hands.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the <HI>parties</HI> in the war may both of them have &s;inned again&s;t the Lord; the <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> may be in the mid&s;t of them both: In which ca&s;e, they are both made u&s;e of in the providence of God to cha&s;ti&s;e one another; and to which of them God will give the advantage is known only to him|&s;elf; unle&s;s that party in the war, who&s;e cau&s;e is ju&s;t, &s;hould put away the <HI>accur&s;ed thing:</HI> in which ca&s;e they might upon good grounds hope for help again&s;t their enemies, &s;o as to be able to &s;tand before them; yea, and to tread them under their feet. Says God, in the text, "thou can&s;t not &s;tand before thine ene|mies, until ye take away the <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> from among you." It may be worthy of &s;pecial notice, tho' the <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> was in the mid&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> yet this &s;hould not hinder their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t their enemies, if they would but take it away. In this ca&s;e, they might, notwith&s;tanding their former folly, hope to come off with glory and victory.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion here is, what are we to under|&s;tand by this "taking away the accur&s;ed thing?" How is it to be done? To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>If the <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> is of &s;uch a nature that the "civil arm" is nece&s;&s;ary to remove it, it is, in this &s;en&s;e, to be taken away. Thus the accur&s;ed thing was taken away from I&s;rael. The &s;in of Achan was
<PB N="16" REF="015759_0014_0F9A28E1A931A780">
a <HI>capital</HI> offence, and it lay with the <HI>civil magi&s;trate,</HI> by cutting off the &s;inner, to clear the community of guilt. Accordingly, <HI>Jo&s;hua and the Elders of I&s;rael</HI> were no &s;ooner made &s;en&s;ible of the &s;in of Achau, than they brought him under trial, pa&s;s &s;entence upon him, and put it in execution in the face of all I&s;rael. In like manner, when the accur&s;ed thing, in the mid&s;t of a people, is of a <HI>capital</HI> nature, the civil magi&s;trate mu&s;t remove it by the death of the offender: or if it be any other crime, which it be|longs to them, as guardians to the &s;tate, to re&s;train or puni&s;h, they mu&s;t, in an authoritative way, purge the community of it.</P>
<P>And permit me to &s;ay here, as <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, the fatherle&s;s, and the widow,</HI> is eminently <HI>the accur&s;ed thing</HI> in the mid&s;t of us, it ought to be taken away, &s;o far as may be, by the powers ordained of God to be his mini&s;ters for good.

a mo&s;t expre&s;s command of the great King and Judge of all the earth. The 82d P&s;alm begins with tho&s;e maje&s;tic words, "God &s;tandeth in the congre|gation of the mighty, he judgeth among the gods," that is, among civil magi&s;trates. It then follows, as a peremptory command to them from the Sovereign of the world, "defend the poor and fatherle&s;s, do ju&s;tice to the afflicted and needy; deliver the poor and needy; rid them out of the hand of the wicked." If it was ever proper, if it ever was, or could be, the duty of the <HI>civil magi&s;trate</HI> to lay re&s;traint upon the malignant vice of oppre&s;&s;ion, as <HI>widows, father|le&s;s children,</HI> and <HI>afflicted needy per&s;ons</HI> are affected by it, it is eminently &s;o now.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible it may be difficult, if within the reach of the magi&s;trates &s;kill or power, to remove that in|ju&s;tice, which, like an overbearing flood, has made its way through the&s;e American States; occa&s;ioned partly by the paper currency, partly by the nece&s;&s;ities of people in this day of general calamity, but prin|cipally by the undue love of money: But however difficult, or impo&s;&s;ible, it may be for the governing power, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, effectually to re&s;train, in general, the affair of <HI>commercial dealing</HI> within the bounds of righteou&s;ne&s;s, this may be done, and without the lea&s;t difficulty, in regard of tho&s;e widows and orphans, together with many others, who have greatly &s;uffered and are &s;till &s;uffering, by means of a <HI>law of this State,</HI> which obliges them to accept of four or five &s;hillings in&s;tead of a pound, or to lo&s;e the yearly intere&s;t which they depend upon for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.

As the emi&s;&s;ion of <HI>paper-bills</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary to the carrying on the war, they might think a law of this kind would tend to prevent their depreciation, and with this view be determined to make it: But as it is now known, notwith&s;tanding this, and every other device, that the depreciation has been amazingly great, and that hundreds and thou&s;ands of helple&s;s widows and orphans, to &s;ay nothing of others, have been reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s by means of it, together with the law that has given it an oppre&s;&s;ive efficacy, it may rea&s;onably be expected, that <HI>the powers that now be</HI> will interdict the continuance of this law, le&s;t there &s;hould be the continuance of that inju&s;tice, which would be a di&s;grace to even a pagan &s;tate.</P>

character, as having reigning in us <HI>this avaricious di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> which has been, and is &s;till productive of all wickedne&s;s, what can we expect but the frowns of heaven upon our military operations? 'Tis true, and ought to be acknowledged with gratitude, the good God has, notwith&s;tanding our great unworthine&s;s, "for his holy name's &s;ake, and to make his power known," given our armies remarkable &s;ucce&s;s in their conte&s;ts with the enemy, at one time and another. So when I&s;rael went again&s;t <HI>Jericho,</HI> it plea&s;ed God by a miraculous exertion of almighty power, to &s;hake down the walls of that &s;trongly fenced city, and deliver it into the hands of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> the chief Jewi&s;h military commander. But <HI>I&s;rael</HI> committed "a tre&s;pa&s;s in the accur&s;ed thing," for which cau&s;e they were after|wards defeated, and driven back by their enemies. Thus it has been with us.

But this was &s;oon followed by that which was greatly di&s;advantageous to us. Upon Admiral <HI>D'E&s;taing'</HI>s leaving the <HI>Delaware</HI> and anchoring at the <HI>Hook,</HI> near <HI>New-York,</HI> an expedition was planned, with a view to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the enemy of <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> by the joint operation of his fleet, and an army to be imme|diately rai&s;ed and &s;ent upon this de&s;ign. No army, it may be, was &s;ooner rai&s;ed, or con&s;i&s;ted of better men, many of whom, tho' men of fortune, figure, and re&s;pectable characters, voluntarily entered upon this &s;ervice as <HI>privates,</HI> for the good of their country: Notwith&s;tanding which, and the mo&s;t flattering pro|&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, they were di&s;appointed: Not for want of wi&s;dom in planting the expedition, or of &s;kill and re&s;olution in the officers and men, either of the army or navy; but by interpo&s;ing frowns in the pro|vidence of him who "&s;itteth King forever."

And if, in con&s;equence of our earne&s;t &s;upplications before the mercy-&s;eat in heaven, we &s;hall be wrought upon to become a peni|tent and obedient people, having faith in God, and in his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we may hope, and upon ju&s;t grounds, that our father's God will be our God, and manife&s;t him&s;elf to be &s;o by "riding in the heavens for our help, and in his excellency on the &s;kies;" giving us occa&s;ion to triumph, and &s;ing, as in the 144th P&s;alm, beginning, "Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord our &s;trength, who teacheth our hands to war, and our fingers to fight; our goodne&s;s and our fortre&s;s, our high tower and deliverer, in whom we tru&s;t: who &s;ubdueth the people under us."</P>
