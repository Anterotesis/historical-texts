<HEAD>Some Account of Inoculating or Tran&s;planting the Small Pox; And of the Benefit and Safety of the Practice.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publick having been lately enter|tained with a very dark and partial Account of this <HI>New Method</HI> of receiving the <HI>Small Pox;</HI> and this Account being given as is pretended, from the very Letters of Dr. <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pylarinus;</HI> it is thought rea|&s;onable and fitting to lay before the Publick this following <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> of what tho&s;e <HI>Learned Gentlemen</HI> have &s;aid of this Practice. But becau&s;e the <HI>Gentleman</HI> who only hath the&s;e Letters by him, refu&s;es now to lend them; the Account here following is chiefly taken from a known <HI>Letter</HI> written by a Learned Gentleman of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to the Worthy Phy&s;icians of the Town.</P>

<HEAD>A Faithful Abridg|ment of Two Ac|counts in the Philo&s;o|phical Tran&s;actions.</HEAD>
<P>I. OUR fir&s;t Communication comes from Dr. <HI>Emanuel Timonius,</HI> a Renowned Fellow of the <HI>Royal Society</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> (well known to &s;ome in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who al&s;o actually knew the Truth of the matter of Fact now going to be related,) who writes from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in <HI>December</HI> 1713. And he informs to this Effect; The practice of procuring the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by a &s;ort of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> has been introduced among the <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitans</HI> by the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians,</HI> and <HI>Georgians,</HI> and other <HI>A&s;iaticks</HI> for about Forty Years. At the fir&s;t the People were cautious and afraid; but the <HI>Happy Succe&s;s</HI> on <HI>Thou|&s;ands</HI> of Per&s;ons for Eight Years now pa&s;t has <HI>put it out of all &s;u&s;picion.</HI> The Operation
<PB N="2" REF="002206_0004_0FDACBFB9830EAB8">
has been performed on Per&s;ons of all Ages, both Sexes, differing Temperaments, &amp; even in the wor&s;t Con&s;titution of the Air; and <HI>none that have u&s;ed it ever died of the Small Pox,</HI> tho' at the &s;ame time, it were &s;o malignant, that at lea&s;t <HI>half the People died,</HI> that were infected with it in the Common way.</P>
<P>They that have this <HI>Inoculation</HI> practi&s;ed on them (he &s;ays) are &s;ubject unto very <HI>Slight Symp|toms,</HI> and hardly &s;en&s;ible of any Sickne&s;s, nor do what <HI>Small Pox</HI> they have, ever leave any Scars or Pits behind them.</P>
<P>They make choice of as Healthy a Young Per&s;on as they can find, that has the <HI>Small Pox</HI> of the be&s;t &s;ort upon him, on the Twelfth or Thirteenth Day of his Decumbiture. With a Needle they prick &s;ome of the larger <HI>Pu&s;tules,</HI> and pre&s;s out the Matter coming from them into &s;ome convenient Ve&s;&s;el of Gla&s;s (or the like) to receive it, which ought fir&s;t of all to be wa&s;hed very clean with warm Water. A convenient quantity of this Mat|ter being thus collected, is to be &s;top'd clo&s;e, and kept warm in the bo&s;om of the Per&s;on that carries it (who ought rather to be &s;ome <HI>other Per&s;on,</HI> than what vi&s;ited the Sick Chamber for it, le&s;t the Infection of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> be convey'd in the <HI>Garment,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Bottle,</HI> and the intended Ope|ration be hurt by the <HI>Infection</HI> being fir&s;t con|veyed
<PB N="3" REF="002206_0005_0FDACBFD1C5A8798">
another way, and &s;o it &s;hould be con|veyed as &s;oon as may be to the Per&s;on that is waiting to be the Patient.</P>
<P>The Patient being in a warm Chamber, is to have &s;everal &s;mall Wounds made with a Surgeon's Three edged Needle, or with a <HI>Lancet,</HI> in two or more Places of the Skin (the be&s;t Places are in the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Arm</HI>) till &s;ome drops of Blood follow: And Immediately let there be dropt out a drop of the Matter in the Gla&s;s, on each of the Places; and mix'd well with the Blood that is i&s;&s;uing out. The Wound &s;hould be covered with half a Walnut &s;hell, or any &s;uch con|cave Ve&s;&s;el, and bound over that the matter may not be rub'd off by the Garments for a few Hours; And now let the Patient (having Fillets on the Wounds,) keep Hou&s;e, and keep warm, and be careful of his Diet; The Cu&s;tom at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is to ab&s;tain from Fle&s;h and Broth for Twenty Days or more. They chu&s;e to perform the Operation either in the beginning of <HI>Winter</HI> or <HI>Spring.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Small Pox</HI> begins &s;ooner in &s;ome than others, and with le&s;&s;er Symptoms in &s;ome than others; but with <HI>happy Succe&s;s in all.</HI> Commonly Ten or Twenty <HI>Pu&s;tules</HI> break out; here and there One has no more than two or three; Few have a <HI>Hundred.</HI> There are &s;ome, in whom no <HI>Pu&s;tules</HI> ri&s;e, but in the
<PB N="4" REF="002206_0006_0FDAC8B992C396C0">
Places where the Inci&s;ion was made: And here the <HI>Tubercles</HI> will be purulent: Yet even <HI>The&s;e</HI> have never had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> afterwards, tho' they have Cohabited with Per&s;ons hav|ing of it. No &s;mall Quantity of Matter will run for &s;everal Days from the Places of the <HI>In&s;ci&s;ion.</HI> The <HI>Pocks</HI> ari&s;ing from this Opera|tion are dried up in a &s;hort time; and fall off, partly in thin Skins, and partly vani&s;hing by an in&s;en&s;ible wa&s;ting.</P>
<P>The Matter is hardly &s;o thick a <HI>Pus</HI> as in the common <HI>Small Pox,</HI> but a thinner kind of <HI>Sanies,</HI> whence it rarely Pitts, except at the Place of the In&s;ci&s;ion, where the <HI>Cicrtrices</HI> are never worn out, and where the matter is more of the common &s;ort.</P>
<P>If an <HI>Apo&s;tem</HI> &s;hould break out in any (which is more frequent in Infants) yet there is no fear, for 'tis heal'd &s;afely by Suppura|tion.</P>
<P>They &s;carce ever u&s;e the matter of the In&s;citious Small Pox to &s;erve the De&s;igns of a new In&s;cition. The <HI>Inoculation</HI> being tryed on &s;uch as have had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before, it had no effect at all on them. Dr. <HI>Timonius</HI> affirms, that he <HI>never yet ob&s;erved any bad Con&s;equence</HI> of the Practice, which now &s;o many do come into.</P>

<P>II. SINCE this Communication from Dr. <HI>Timonius,</HI> there came to the ROYAL SOCIETY a further, from an Eminent Per&s;on who&s;e Name is <HI>Jacobus Pylarinus;</HI> the <HI>Vene|tian</HI> Con&s;ul at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> and who appears to have had no knowledge, of what had been written by the former. It is Entituled, <HI>A New and Safe Method of Exciting the Small-Pox by Tran&s;plantation.</HI></P>
<P>This Gentleman ob&s;erves, That this <HI>Won|derful Invention</HI> was fir&s;t found out, not by the Learned Sons of Erudition, but by a Mean, Coar&s;e, Rude &s;ort of People, for the <HI>Succour of Mankind</HI> under and again&s;t one of the mo&s;t <HI>Cruel Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> in the World. It was rarely if ever u&s;ed among People of Quality, until after the beginning of the pre&s;ent Cen|tury. A Noble <HI>Groecian</HI> then in di&s;tre&s;s for his Four little Sons, le&s;t the <HI>Small Pox</HI> might bereave him of them, con&s;ulted with him about u&s;ing the <HI>Inoculation</HI> upon them. At fir&s;t, his Ignorance of the Matter, made him decline giving any Advice upon it; But a <HI>Groecian Woman</HI> who was a notable <HI>Inocula|trix,</HI> happening to come in, while they were di&s;cour&s;ing of the Matter, told them &s;o much about it, that the Experiment was re&s;olved on. The Woman managed in her way, upon all the Four Sons. The Three Younger, all of which were under Seven Years of Age, felt
<PB N="6" REF="002206_0008_0FDACC0197BB68B0">
a very <HI>gentle Illne&s;s,</HI> had very <HI>few Pu&s;tules,</HI> and in about a Week all Fever and Hazard was over with them. The Elde&s;t, about Eight Years old, was taken with a malignant Fe|ver: and (tho' he had not many Pu&s;tules) narrowly e&s;caped with his Life. <HI>Pylarinus</HI> imputes this, to an <HI>Atrabiliarious,</HI> and other|wi&s;e Humourous &amp; Unhealthy Con&s;titution of the Lad, and a neglect of u&s;ing &s;uch <HI>Pre|paratory Expiation</HI> of his Body, as they had been advi&s;ed unto. But upon this <HI>Happy Succe&s;s,</HI> it was wonderful to &s;ee, what a <HI>Mul|titude of People of Fa&s;hion</HI> pre&s;ently followed the Example. So that at this Day <HI>every one does</HI> without any He&s;itation, and with all the &s;ecurity imaginable, practice the <HI>Tran&s;|plantation;</HI> except here and there a few Cowards that are afraid of their Shadows. Indeed, the <HI>Turks</HI> who&s;e Faith in Fate, is as we know, and who are a more Indocible &s;ort of Animals, <HI>do not yet</HI> much come into it.</P>
<P><HI>Pylarinus,</HI> in&s;tructed by his Greek Opera|trix, directs to take, a <HI>Proper Sea&s;on</HI> for the In&s;cition. She would u&s;e it only in the Win|ter, but he thinks the <HI>Spring</HI> may do as well.</P>
<P>The Fermenting <HI>Pus</HI> mu&s;t be taken from the mature Pu&s;tules of a good Sort, in a Young Per&s;on of a good Con&s;titution, kept Warm in a clo&s;e Vial, and ha&s;tened unto the Applica|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002206_0009_0FDACC031A1C6AF0">
The Air of the Chamber mu&s;t be kept very Temperate. The Greek <HI>Operatrix,</HI> prick't more places, and le&s;s fle&s;hy ones than <HI>Pylari|nus</HI> approved of; with an oblique &s;troke pricking the Places, with an Iron, or Golden Needle dropping, and thru&s;ting the <HI>Pus</HI> into the Wound; and &s;o binding all with Fillets. Her way was thus to prick the <HI>Forehead,</HI> the <HI>Chin,</HI> both <HI>Cheeks,</HI> both <HI>Wri&s;ts,</HI> both <HI>In&s;teps.</HI> This was doubtle&s;s overdoing. <HI>Pylarinus</HI> affirms that &s;ome have done the Bu&s;ine&s;s, with <HI>no more than One</HI> little In&s;ci&s;ion in the Arm, and it has done very well. [So it has been with &s;uch <HI>Africans,</HI> as have &s;hown us the Marks of their Inoculation.]</P>
<P>They mu&s;t not keep their Beds more than is nece&s;&s;ary. <HI>Wine, Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Broth</HI> mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Ferment comes into Action in &s;ome &s;ooner than in others. U&s;ually the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> (as far as it may be called &s;o,) appears on the <HI>Seventh-Day;</HI> &s;ometimes on the very <HI>Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Symptoms prove <HI>Remi&s;s</HI> or <HI>Inten&s;e</HI> ac|cording to the various Con&s;titutions of the Bo|dies. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> proves of the <HI>Di&s;tinct Sort;</HI> and there will be but few of them; it may be Ten, or Twenty; rarely a <HI>Hundred.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ome <HI>few</HI> the <HI>In&s;ci&s;ion</HI> has produced no <HI>Small Pox</HI> at all; but the Per&s;ons have after|wards
<PB N="8" REF="002206_0010_0FDACC04973CD270">
in the common way been taken and handled with it like other People. The Wounds made for the <HI>In&s;ci&s;ion,</HI> prove often very &s;ore. And with &s;ome they degenerate into <HI>Apo&s;tems.</HI> Yea, The&s;e do &s;well &s;ome|times, and ri&s;e, and fall, and ri&s;e again&punc; There has al&s;o happened on this Occa&s;ion an <HI>Ab&s;ce&s;s</HI> with Suppuration, in &s;ome Emunctory of the Body: But this is a very rare <HI>Occur|rence.</HI></P>
<P>In Fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, <HI>Pylarinus</HI> affirms; It was hardly ever known, that there was any <HI>Ill Con&s;e|quence</HI> of this <HI>Tran&s;plantation,</HI> But the Bu|&s;ine&s;s being well and wi&s;ely managed, &amp; the Body being by a skilful Phy&s;ician Well-pre|pared, you may depend upon it <HI>(he &s;ays)</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n ordinary way, there can be <HI>nothing but a Good I&s;&s;ue of it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>I. LET it be con&s;idered, That the&s;e Com|munications come from Great Men, and Per&s;ons of Great Erudition and Reputa|tion, and are addre&s;s'd unto very Eminent Per&s;ons. Let it be al&s;o con&s;idered, that with the Approbation of the ROYAL SOCIETY (as Illu&s;trious a Body as are in the World) their Secretary the celebrated Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> has publi&s;h'd the&s;e things, as worthy to come into the notice of Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002206_0011_0FDACC0617DCCB90">
II. There is at this Time a con&s;iderable Number of <HI>Africans</HI> in this Town, who can have no Con&s;piracy or Combination to cheat us. No body has in&s;tructed them to tell their Story. The more plainly, brokenly, and blunderingly, and like Ideots, they tell their Story, it will be with rea&s;onable Men, but the much more credible. For <HI>that the&s;e</HI> all agree in <HI>one Story;</HI> <Q>That abundance of poor Negro's die of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> till they learn this <HI>Way;</HI> that People take the Juice of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and <HI>Cut the Skin,</HI> and put in a drop; then by'nd by a little <HI>Sick,</HI> then few <HI>Small Pox;</HI> and no body dye of it: no body have <HI>Small Pox</HI> any more.</Q></P>
<P>Here we have a clear Evidence, that in <HI>A|frica,</HI> where the Poor Creatures dye of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in the common way like Rotten Sheep, a Merciful GOD has taught them a <HI>wonderful Pre&s;ervative.</HI></P>
<P>It is a <HI>Common Practice,</HI> and is is attended with <HI>Succe&s;s.</HI> I have as full Evidence of this, as I have that there are <HI>Lions</HI> in <HI>Africa.</HI> And I don't know why 'tis more unlaw|ful to learn of <HI>Africans,</HI> how to help again&s;t the <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> than it is to learn of our <HI>Indians,</HI> how to help again&s;t the <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> of a <HI>Rattle-Snake.</HI></P>
<P>III. Is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive, that this Prac|tice &s;hould continue among People <HI>Forty Years</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002206_0012_0FDACC079A890B88">
together, and grow more and more into re|pute, and at la&s;t be put out of all <HI>Su&s;picion,</HI> and yet that there &s;hould be any Truth in the Reports of People's <HI>dying</HI> under the <HI>Ope|ration,</HI> or being liable to the <HI>Small Pox</HI> after it? Had Peoples Limbs peri&s;hed, or had they been liable to the Small Pox after it, we may be &s;ure, a few Examples would have put an end to the Practice <HI>Forty Years</HI> ago. Good Readers, Judge calmly, and like rea&s;onable Men.</P>
<P>IV. The Author of the&s;e <HI>Abridgments</HI> ad|dre&s;s'd them unto tho&s;e, who had the <HI>Origi|nals</HI> in their Hands; and therefore it cannot be thought, that it was not as <HI>Faithful a Re|port</HI> as he could make of the matter; But it having been in&s;inuated, that there might be a more full and perfect Relation, The Author de&s;ires it, and I de&s;ire it my &s;elf, That the Accounts given in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> be permitted by the Owner to come abroad, and be publi&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>Word for Word,</HI> that <HI>impar|tial Men</HI> may &s;ee <HI>with their own Eyes,</HI> the true &s;tate of the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>V. It might be ea&s;y for me to make An&s;wers to the Scurrilous things lately Publi&s;hed a|gain&s;t me, and &s;atisfy the Publick of the <HI>Fal&s;hood</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s</HI> in them. But I think it rather becomes a con&s;iderate Man to de|cline <HI>fooli&s;h Contentions;</HI> e&s;pecially at a time, when there is <HI>a grievous Calamity</HI> upon us,
<PB N="11" REF="002206_0013_0FDACC0965E825B8">
that calls us (in&s;tead of railing at one ano|ther) to Unite in Prayers to Almighty GOD, for His Mercies to us. And therefore if any think to go on with their <HI>Calumnies &amp; Foole|ries,</HI> I &s;hall not think fit to take any Notice of them. What I do (I hope as it has hi|therto done) will <HI>vindicate it &s;elf</HI> with Peo|ple of Thought and Probity.</P>
<P>VI. I have made my <HI>Experiments</HI> with all the <HI>Di&s;advantages</HI> that can be imagined, on <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Young,</HI> on <HI>Strong</HI> and <HI>Weak,</HI> on <HI>Male</HI> and <HI>Female,</HI> on <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black,</HI> and in the <HI>wor&s;t Sea&s;on</HI> of the Year; and on <HI>greater Numbers,</HI> than I judge proper (con&s;idering the unaccountable Rage of unadvi&s;ed People) to mention; But more than <HI>twice Seven,</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you; and it has &s;ucceeded well in all, even beyond Expectation.</P>
<P>VII. We are yet but <HI>Learners;</HI> and hope through Experience to grow more expert in our Practice. In <HI>&s;ome</HI> of my <HI>Experiments</HI> hitherto, I have found the <HI>Fever</HI> &s;omewhat more <HI>inten&s;e</HI> for a few Hours before the <HI>E|ruption,</HI> and the Number of the <HI>Pu&s;tles</HI> to be &s;omewhat more than u&s;ual in the <HI>Levant.</HI> Whether this be from the <HI>Sea&s;on of the Year,</HI> or our <HI>Different Climate,</HI> or our <HI>high way of Living,</HI> or our want of more <HI>Experience</HI> I cannot &s;ay, till I &s;ee further. But Experi|ence declares things to fall out <HI>for the main,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002206_0014_0FDACC0A9743CF80">
ju&s;t as the Renowned TIMONIUS and PYLARINUS have related. And I have hitherto by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD been able with ea&s;e to manage what <HI>Fever</HI> my Patients have had, and have never done any thing, but what every body knows is done in other common Fevers. Upon the fir&s;t <HI>Eruption</HI> this <HI>Fever</HI> abates and goes off, the Patients grow &s;o ea&s;y, that one has much ado to keep them in the condition of Patients. They have not the lea&s;t Touch of that <HI>Second Fever,</HI> which People generally dye of in the com|mon way. The <HI>Pu&s;tules</HI> are <HI>very few</HI> in &s;ome; in others, they are two or three <HI>Hundred,</HI> but at the wor&s;t, nothing to what is u&s;ual in the ordinary way of Infection. They quickly dry away. The Patients are abroad again, &s;ooner than they who are infected in the common way; and they are on all ac|counts as well as they were before.</P>
<P>The Sores of the Inci&s;ion dige&s;t and heal as well as any other common Sores do, and if they &s;hould grow angry or trouble|&s;ome, a very little Skill and Medicine will &s;erve to cure them. From all I have hither|to &s;een, there can be no more ill con&s;equence of them, than from a sore Finger neglected.</P>
<P>We are informed that there is now and then, but very rarely, a little Ab&s;ce&s;s in &s;ome Emunctory of the Body: but we have met with no &s;uch thing in our Practice, and we
<PB N="13" REF="002206_0015_0FDACC0C16566240">
think when &s;uch did, or may happen, that it was, or may be from neglect or want of Skill in the Practitioner: nor have our Patients hitherto had the Boils or other Swellings which are common in the ordinary Small Pox, &s;o much le&s;s is the Blood and other Jui|ces corrupt in this, than the ordinary way. Now to form a Cry of the <HI>Plague</HI> on this occa&s;ion, as if the Practi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e would bring the <HI>Plague:</HI> This is &s;o exce&s;&s;ively ridiculous, that it is a wonder any People can think, much le&s;s, talk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o.

that yet appears, here is a Di&s;covery, that is a great <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to <HI>Mankind,</HI> and &s;hould be thankfully receiv'd: A way to defend our &s;elves again&s;t a dreadful and a deadly Di&s;|ea&s;e, by <HI>over ruling the way</HI> of it's coming at us, when we &s;ee 'tis coming. Many <HI>Lives</HI> might be &s;aved, &s;ome <HI>Time</HI> al&s;o, and &s;ome <HI>Charge,</HI> (which <HI>&s;ome it may be, con&s;ider</HI>) and the Health of the Town much &s;ooner re&s;tored; if the Practitioners and the People in the Town would come more into this Practice.</P>
<P>The other <HI>Clamours</HI> and <HI>Bugbears</HI> having been conquered, all that now remains is this: The <HI>People</HI> will <HI>have the Small Pox again.</HI> The only An&s;wer that need be given is this; we have never yet <HI>credibly heard any In&s;tance</HI> thereof. And tho&s;e, who have pa&s;&s;ed under the <HI>Inoculation</HI> or <HI>Tran&s;plantation,</HI> are every Day vi&s;iting, and attending the Sick; with all the a&s;&s;urance and &s;afety that can be. Some will confidently affirm, that to their Knowledge a Man may have the <HI>Small Pox a Second Time</HI> in the common way. And yet this hinders not the Encouragement of them who have had it once to be no more afraid of catching it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;es many wor|thy Good People. The Ca&s;e in &s;hort we take to be this. <Q>Almighty GOD in His great Mercy to Mankind, has taught us a <HI>Remedy,</HI> to be u&s;ed when the dangers of the <HI>Small
<PB N="15" REF="002206_0017_0FDACC0F16903AD8">
Pox</HI> di&s;tre&s;s us; upon the u&s;e of which <HI>Medicine,</HI> they &s;hall in an ordinary way be &s;ure not to have it &s;o &s;everely as in the other way, and con&s;equently not to be in &s;uch danger from this dreadful Di&s;temper, and al&s;o to be delivered from the terrible <HI>Cir|cum&s;tances</HI> which many of them who reco|ver of the Di&s;temper do &s;uffer for it.</Q></P>
<P>Whether a Chri&s;tian may not employ this <HI>Medicine</HI> (let the matter of it be what it will) and humbly give Thanks to God for His <HI>good Providence</HI> in di&s;covering of it to a mi&s;erable World; and humbly look up to His Good Pro|vidence (as wedoin the u&s;e of any other Medi|cine) for the &s;ucce&s;s of it? It may &s;eem &s;trange, that any wi&s;e Chri&s;tian cannot an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>And how &s;trangely do Men that call them|&s;elves <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> betray their <HI>Anatomy,</HI> and their <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> as well as their <HI>Divinity</HI> in their invectives again&s;t this Practice? For in the Fir&s;t place, they make a mighty bu&s;tle about <HI>Malignant filth</HI> infus'd into the Ma&s;s of Blood, &amp;c. as if there were no Difference between injecting a quantity of &s;ome poi&s;o|nous Matter in &s;ome large <HI>Blood Ve&s;&s;el,</HI> and that of applying a <HI>Drop</HI> outwardly to the <HI>Scarified Skin,</HI> which when we con&s;ider ap|pears to be only a drop of that which our Skins are fill'd with when we are full of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and a con&s;iderable part of which
<PB N="16" REF="002206_0018_0FDACC1096BC34A8">
is return'd into the Blood again, and yet the Sick does very well. And further, when this Drop is apply'd to a Per&s;on who has had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before, and altho' it enters, and is receiv'd by Nature in &s;uch, as well as others, as I have experienc'd, yet nature is able to ca&s;t it off without the Phy&s;icians help; and that agrees with what our Author <HI>Timo|nius</HI> tells us; that when it has been try'd on &s;uch as have had it before, it has had no effect. Secondly, And as to their <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> that the People <HI>will have it again,</HI> this is a wonder to me; when I &s;ee the Fever produc'd as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eperate and ca&s;t out the <HI>Pocky matter,</HI> and that they have a fair <HI>Pock</HI> or <HI>Pu&s;tule,</HI> and this capable of Infecting and producing the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in the ordinary way on others, and to the &s;ame Degree, this renders it with me beyond all doubt, that they who have had it once thus in this way, are as well &s;ecur'd from having it again, as tho&s;e who have had it favourably in the other way, which hath been prov'd by tho&s;e that have had but one or two Pu&s;tules. Con|&s;tant Experience has al&s;o confirmed it in ma|ny thou&s;ands of In&s;tances. But what makes this Practice &s;o valuable to us, in my Opinion is, that we &s;hall e&s;cape the Violence, Rage and Hazard that we are expos'd to in the <HI>common way;</HI> except we are infected before,
<PB N="17" REF="002206_0019_0FDACC12187B0F30">
as we are certain poor Mrs. <HI>E&s;ther Webb</HI> was&mdash;And even <HI>there</HI> we may hope that the Sores of the In&s;ci&s;ions may help to carry off the Morbifick matter, and &s;ave the Patient; for this Per&s;on is recovered, altho' &s;he had one of the wor&s;t Sort that ever was known. And much more on this Head might be &s;aid, why this way of <HI>Infection</HI> is more &s;afe and ea&s;y, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat of the <HI>Common way,</HI> but this may &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Divinity,</HI> they would limit God in His Ble&s;&s;ing of &s;ome one or other particular part, or particle of His lower Creation, us'd by the Phy&s;ician or Surgeon to prevent, moderate, alter, or cure a Di&s;ea&s;e in their Patient; the which I never yet heard was denied the Phy&s;ician or Surgeon to u&s;e as afore&s;aid by God or Man.</P>
<P>But for this I refer my &s;elf to the fol|lowing Quaeries.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> As to the &s;piteful and &s;currilous things written again&s;t me and this Practice, at pre&s;ent I &s;hall take no further No|tice of them, but remind the Writers of the ill natur'd Dog in the Fable, that would neither eat the Oats him&s;elf, nor let the Hor&s;e eat them: So neither will the&s;e u&s;e a true and certain way to &s;ave the Peoples Lives, nor are they willing to let any one el&s;e u&s;e it to &s;ave them.</P>

<HEAD>A Few Quaeries humbly Offered.</HEAD>
<P>I. IF it &s;hould be &s;o that the Compa&s;&s;ion of GOD to His Creatures, &s;hould Enlighten us with the Knowledge of a <HI>Sweat</HI> or a <HI>Purge,</HI> that would <HI>Certainly,</HI> or but <HI>Probably</HI> &s;ecure us from ever taking the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> I <HI>Enquire,</HI> Whether any People would be &s;o very fooli&s;h, as to judge it <HI>Unlawful</HI> to take &s;uch a Remedy. Or, would not every Wi&s;e Man think, that all the <HI>Days of a whole Year,</HI> were too few to be turn'd into <HI>Days of Thanksgiv|ing,</HI> for the Di&s;covery of &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing to a Mi&s;erable World?

<P>II. Phy&s;icians have very often given their Patients <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Salivation,</HI> to remove, yea, and &s;ometimes to <HI>Prevent</HI> grievous Di&s;ea&s;es. Thou&s;ands have Died in and from that O|peration; yet becau&s;e Thou&s;ands have got Good by it, the Operation is every Day re|peated. There is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">y &s;o Impertinent as to call this, a <HI>Tempting of Providence.</HI> I <HI>Enquire,</HI> Why a <HI>De&s;pumation,</HI> or, An Opera|tion that will, we mu&s;t not &s;ay, <HI>Salivate,</HI> but we may &s;ay, <HI>De&s;pumate,</HI> the matter that

would be fuel for the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> at proper Orifices, can be more liable to Exceptions; E&s;pecially, when it was never yet known, that <HI>One Per&s;on has died</HI> under it or by it? Or, why may not the <HI>Succus Variolatus</HI> be u&s;ed, as well as <HI>Mercury?</HI></P>
<P>III. It is Objected, That you <HI>Pre&s;ume upon Providence</HI> in this E&s;&s;ay for the Prevention of the <HI>Small Pox;</HI> for <HI>you don't know whe|ther you &s;hall ever have the Small Pox, or no.</HI> I An&s;wer, But what if it be as likely that I &s;hall have it, as it is that my Hou&s;e will take Fire, when my Neighbours an Inch and half off, is in Flames. <HI>Pray, &s;it &s;till, my Neighbour, your Hou&s;e is not yet on Fire: The Almighty can pre&s;erve it.</HI> But I Enquire, whether this Objection will not lie again&s;t all the <HI>Preventive Phy&s;ick</HI> in the World? I don't Infallibly know, that I &s;hall ever <HI>&s;uffer</HI> the Di&s;ea&s;e I am going to <HI>prevent.</HI></P>
<P>IV. The Objection here is, I <HI>make my &s;elf Sick, when I am Well.</HI> But I again &s;ay, Will any Man decry all <HI>Preventing Phy&s;ick,</HI> as Unlawful? Why do our Phy&s;icians encou|rage People every <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> to take it? Don't People take the <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> of a <HI>Vomit</HI> into their very <HI>Stomachs,</HI> to <HI>prevent</HI> a Sickne&s;s a thou&s;and times le&s;s to be feared, than the <HI>Small Pox?</HI> Why may not I as well take a <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> into my <HI>Arm,</HI> or my Leg, to prevent
<PB N="20" REF="002206_0022_0FDACC1698B3C6B8">
&s;uch a Malady. Many have Died of a <HI>Vomit.</HI> It is not yet known, that any <HI>one ever Died</HI> of the Operation, that is now &s;o cavil'd at. To &s;ay that our SAVIOUR's words, <HI>The whole need not a Phy&s;ician,</HI> forbid all <HI>preventing Phy&s;ick,</HI> is a gro&s;s abu&s;e of them.

<P>V. Meerly to prevent a little <HI>Headach,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch &s;leight Malady, may not I apply &s;uch a <HI>Poi&s;on,</HI> as an <HI>Epi&s;pa&s;tic</HI> of <HI>Spani&s;h Flies</HI> to my Arm; A <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> which will &s;et the Hu|mours of my Body all a working, and pene|trate unto the very <HI>Bladder,</HI> and produce even a <HI>Bloody Urine</HI> there?</P>
<P>VI. But an <HI>Anxious Fear</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox;</HI> is not this an <HI>Evil Di&s;ea&s;e?</HI> E&s;peci|ally when I have it &s;o near me, that 'tis next to a Miracle if I e&s;cape it?

<P>VII. The Celebrated <HI>Sydenham</HI> advi&s;es, That <HI>Purges</HI> be u&s;ed, before the Infection of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> be taken, which hopefully prepare the Body, to feel <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and of the <HI>better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&punc;</HI> Will any be &s;o Ridiculous as to count this Unlawful, under a frivilous pretence that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>know</HI> whether they &s;hall have the <HI>Small Pox</HI> or no.</P>
<P>VIII. I humbly Enquire, whether the <HI>Sixth Commandment</HI> has not required us to

u&s;e Means that may be Lawfully u&s;ed for the <HI>Pre&s;ervation of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; others?</HI> And what is there Unlawful in what is nowpropo&s;ed?</P>
<P>IX. There is a &s;illy Cavil; <HI>We pray that the Small Pox may not &s;pread; and yet we do our &s;elves by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">an&s;plantation &s;pread it.</HI> But I <HI>Enquire</HI> whether People know what they Pray for?

XI.
