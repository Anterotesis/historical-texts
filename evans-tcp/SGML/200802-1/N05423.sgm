<BIBL>PSALM CXXII.4, 5.</BIBL>
<Q>Whither the Tribes go up, tbe Tribes of the Lord, unto the Te&s;timony of I&s;rael, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord. For there are &s;et Thrones of Judgment: the Thrones of the Hou&s;e of David.</Q>

<P>THE great Author of Nature, hath form'd and de&s;ign'd his Creature Man for Society, both Civil and Religious; which, as it is agree|able to his very Make, and nece&s;&s;ary to his pre&s;ent State; &s;o, is adapted to his multi|farious Advantage: In&s;omuch, that any manner of Conduct, which expre&s;&s;eth a Man's mind to live by him&s;elf, ab&s;tract from any Relation to Society; or to Wor&s;hip only by him&s;elf and not with others; or that &s;hews a thought, as if he could be &s;afe and happy alone, Independant on Community; is a Contradiction to the de&s;ign of the Creator in ranking him with the humane Species, &amp;
<PB N="2" REF="006868_0005_102A7F26DAB19A58">
to the Con&s;titution &amp; Wants of &s;uch a kind of Creature. For, the Foundation laid in our Nature for Society, together with the mu|tual Dependance we have on one another, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent fallen State, do all point out our Duty to dwell together as Brethren in Unity, as Members of Society, compacted and cemented by all the Bonds of Union, which fitly frame and build up Individuals into a Body politic for the Good of the whole.</P>
<P>VERY evident then, it is; that <HI>Men</HI> were not de&s;ign'd for an <HI>Un&s;ocial Life,</HI> and e&s;pe|cially with their pre&s;ent depraved Powers, are by no means, to remain in <HI>a State of Na|ture</HI>; each one to po&s;&s;e&s;s by him&s;elf, and u&s;e for him&s;elf his natural Rights &amp; Liberties, without any borrowed Strength and Advan|tage from others by Compact: i. e. without Incorporating into Society, or having any known e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws and Rules agreed upon, as a common Standard to govern the whole; or any &s;upream Head or known acknowleged Rulers and Officers to keep the whole in a ju&s;t Decorum; and that for the general Peace and Safety of them all.&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT <HI>they</HI> are rather de&s;ign'd by God to be, to Sub&s;i&s;t, and Act in <HI>a State of Community,</HI> United and Strengthned by certain Bonds, for the Pre&s;ervation of the Lives &amp; Fortunes
<PB N="3" REF="006868_0006_102A7F2931ACF6F8">
of each Individual; and even from all Mi&s;|chievous A&s;&s;aults by their Fellows. &mdash; And, as it is fitting; &s;o, indeed nece&s;&s;ary now, that Men's natural Rights be given up to Com|munity, whereby, tho&s;e may be exerci&s;ed for the Good of every one; as they cannot be, while in the Hands of Individuals them|&s;elves; for, the Strength of each particular Per&s;on being giv'n up to Society and lodg'd with this collective Body, for common Bene|fit: Every Member may have the Strength of the whole employed for the Security of his own Life and Property. And al&s;o rejoyce in his Neighbours having the &s;ame Protection and Advantage with him&s;elf: So that, the Privileges of Society mu&s;t be va&s;tly greater than all the Rights of Nature &s;eparately Con&s;ider'd and U&s;ed. This, (it &s;eems) is very plain.</P>
<P>AND, as evident it is, that nothing Argues and Repre&s;ents a People more truly great; or, Renders them more Safe and Happy; than their firm Union in the&s;e two Impor|tant Intere&s;ts, Civil and Religious; (the&s;e always Implying the divine Pre&s;ence and Protection) the&s;e then, are the two grand things nece&s;&s;ary to the well being of Society, (viz.) RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT; firmly E&s;tabli&s;h'd, duly Exerci&s;ed, and well United; as Sub&s;i&s;ting together in the &s;ame
<PB N="4" REF="006868_0007_102A7F2BDCC6CE58">
Community; rendring it, whether con&s;idered as <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>State</HI>: An harmonious Polity. And happy, (I &s;ay) by virtue of this Union in what is their true and common Intere&s;t.&mdash;Which, was indeed the View here taken, of Jeru&s;alem of old; when &s;aid to be <HI>Builded as a City, that is Compact together.</HI> For, however Populous that City, and Contiguous their Buildings; the main Excellence &amp; Ad|vantage of this Union, and the chief Glory intended by it's being thus Compacted; lay in this, that <HI>there,</HI>was <HI>the Te&s;timony of I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>there, the &s;et Thrones of Judgment.</HI> Thus Situated near one to the other, that they might Befriend each other: And both toge|ther &s;erve the be&s;t Good of the Community, &s;o Di&s;tingui&s;hed and Dignified by them. which, was no &s;mall Motive (it &s;eems) to invite the People up to Jeru&s;alem, in a col|lective Body at certain Sea&s;ons, that <HI>there</HI> they might'nt only join in Social Wor&s;hip ac|cording to the divine In&s;titution; but al&s;o, <HI>there</HI> receive the &s;ignal Benefit of a civil Admini&s;tration of God's Appointing like|wi&s;e &mdash; As it is elegantly expre&s;&s;ed in the Text, <HI>Whither the Tribes go up, the Tribes of the Lord, Unto the Te&s;timony of I&s;rael, to give Thanks unto the Name of the Lord, for there are &s;et Thrones of Judgment, the Thrones of the Hou&s;e of David.</HI> Which would be
<PB N="5" REF="006868_0008_102A7F2F6986BCC0">
an Advantage to them, not only when they were Together at Jeru&s;alem on public Occa|&s;ions; but al&s;o when Di&s;per&s;ed again to their &s;everal Di&s;tricts, and in their private Habi|tations: As, &s;uch a Unity contributed to the common Safety &amp; Intere&s;t of the Whole at all Times.</P>
<P>Now, this whole <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> was Written by <HI>David,</HI> to promote the Peoples Unity in the Wor&s;hip of God, and Subjection to Govern|ment; and &s;o to An&s;wer the De&s;ign of their common Good and Pro&s;perity. And here. Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The ancient Practice of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by God's Appointment, (viz.) Their A&s;&s;embling to|gether, <HI>at Jeru&s;alem,</HI> three times a Year to Wor&s;hip God in the mo&s;t public Manner, at the&s;e fixed Periods and appointed Solemn Fea&s;ts, which the better part of the People greatly Rejoiced in; a delightful Token this! of their great and beneficial Unity. V. 1&mdash;3. <HI>I was glad, when they &s;aid unto me, Let us go into the Hou&s;e of the Lord. Our feet &s;hall &s;tand within thy Gates, O Jeru&s;alem. Jeru|&s;alem is builded as a City that is Compact to|gether.</HI> And Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Recommendation of this Practice, and of the Excellence of Society, and of Unity therein, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Carrying therein, an Invitation to all the tribes of I&s;rael to conti|nue
<PB N="6" REF="006868_0009_102A7F31005EFC68">
in their A&s;&s;embling <HI>at Jeru&s;alem</HI> to Wor&s;hip God together, and <HI>there,</HI> to receive the Benefit of the be&s;t civil Admini&s;tration: for <HI>there,</HI> were the &s;et Thrones of Judgment, <HI>the Thrones of the Hou&s;e of David,</HI> as well as <HI>the Te&s;timony of I&s;rael:</HI> which, contains Arguments to pre&s;s upon the People all that Conduct in a Community which becomes tho&s;e that would be Safe and Happy: As, their Agreeing well in <HI>their Religion</HI> and in their <HI>Regard to the Government</HI> which God had &s;et over them: Let all the Tribes, (<HI>the Tribes of the Lord</HI> thus dignified with <HI>that Character</HI>) Agree to meet one another <HI>at Jeru&s;alem</HI>: For there's the <HI>Te&s;timony of I&s;rael</HI> and the &s;et <HI>Thrones of Judgment:</HI> How grand the Expre&s;&s;ions, full of Maje&s;ty, an&s;werable to the great Ideas and Richne&s;s of tho't Expre&s;s'd by them.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash; <HI>The Te&s;timony of I&s;rael.</HI> i. e. God's Te&s;timony delivered to I&s;rael, honourably di&s;tingui&s;hing them from all other People who had not his Word and his Statutes as I&s;rael had. Becau&s;e of this, were the Tribes of I&s;rael Directed and Encouraged to A&s;&s;em|ble <HI>at Jeru&s;alem</HI>: For <HI>there,</HI> was the <HI>Ark of God,</HI> wherein was his Te&s;timony, the Re|velation of his Mind and Will to his People. And another Argument (it &s;eems) for their A&s;&s;embling <HI>there,</HI> is that <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was not
<PB N="7" REF="006868_0010_102A7F32926EDF40">
only the <HI>Holy,</HI> but the <HI>Royal City.</HI> For <HI>there,</HI> al&s;o, are <HI>&s;et Thrones of Judgment.</HI> i e. an E&s;tabli&s;hed civil Government by a divine Con&s;titution, and Settled by God in <HI>the Hou&s;e of David,</HI> a Man after God's own Heart. And add to all; this was <HI>the beautiful City,</HI> in that, it was &s;o compacted and cemented in its public Intere&s;ts; the Te&s;timony of I&s;rael and the &s;et Thrones of Judgment &s;o near together. i. e. their civil and religious Intere&s;ts &s;trongly United for the benefit of the whole Community. For at that Time, <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> was not divided into two Cities or Towns, as when in the hands of the <HI>Jebu&s;ites,</HI> but united (th&ocirc; enlarged) as a City compact together: E&s;pecially, United in its <HI>Govern|ment</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI>; which, (as <HI>Pool</HI> ob|&s;erves) were di&s;tinct and oppo&s;ite before <HI>David</HI> took the <HI>Fort of Zion</HI> from the <HI>Jebu|&s;ites</HI>; but now, happily United. <Q>A good|ly Sight this (&s;ays <HI>Henry</HI>) that the Te&s;timony of I&s;rael and the &s;et Thrones of Judgment were &s;uch near and good Neighbours. i. e. Mutually Serving one another. The Te&s;timony of I&s;rael direct|ing the Thrones of Judgment, and the&s;e protecting the Te&s;timony of I&s;rael.</Q>&mdash;And thus may I ob&s;erve, that the Argu|ment for I&s;raels A&s;&s;embling together, as one harmonious Body, fini&s;hes from the Advantage
<PB N="8" REF="006868_0011_102A7F35E75AA560">
of their having both Religion and Govern|ment therein; both the means of the Edifi|cation and Salvation of their Souls; and of the Protection and Safety of their Per&s;ons and Property. &mdash; And how indeed, can it go right well, with any people under Heaven where the bands of Society are bur&s;t a&s;un|der, and tho&s;e two great and important In|tere&s;ts are Bani&s;hed; or are not well E&s;tabli|&s;hed and blended for the common Good of the whole, and the People well agreed to|gether to make the be&s;t u&s;e of them both. Agreably, the de&s;ign of all may be &s;umm'd up in this general point of Doctrine to be di&s;cour|&s;ed of, on this mo&s;t public Occa&s;ion, (viz.)</P>
<P><HI>That Religion &amp; Government, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting together in a firm Union, are the Glory, Safety and Happine&s;s of a People Uniting, in their ju&s;t Regard to Both.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall,</P>

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething <HI>of the Religion, and Government, which are &s;o Nece&s;&s;ary to the Good of Community.</HI></P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, that the&s;e two Intere&s;ts are what the &s;acred Penman doth connect here, in the Idea, or general Notion of a happy People, comprized in the <HI>Te&s;timony of I&s;rael,</HI> and the <HI>&s;et Thrones of Judgment</HI>: It &s;eems, he did not &s;peak of I&s;rael a Body Politic, as under any Advantage to be truly a Dignify'd and Happy People without <HI>Religion and Government</HI>; nor did he pre|tend to invite the Tribes of I&s;rael up to Jeru|&s;alem, to take the great Privileges of &s;uch a collective Body, but with the views of <HI>the&s;e</HI> being there, in an eminent Manner; and from thence, to &s;pread their benign Influence, thro' all parts of that Incorpo|rated Community. Now then,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="006868_0013_102A7F3B28F26818">1. As to <HI>the Religion,</HI> which is &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary to the Good of a Community. 'Tis certainly &s;omething more than the <HI>Religion of Nature.</HI> 'Tis a Religion which has the Stamp of divine Revelation upon it; the Revealed Te&s;timony of God. <HI>The Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the great Head of the Church, and Governour of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Religion of Nature,</HI> that is not Enough to make Individuals, nor a Community, Happy: When the Principles of it, are &s;o much lo&s;t from Man, by the Fall; and &s;o con&s;tantly Corrupted by de|praved Rea&s;on and the Lu&s;ts of Men. I &s;ay then, the Religion taught by the <HI>Light of Nature</HI> and containing the Principles of moral Virtue, con&s;idered Ab&s;tract from divine Revelation; is not &s;ufficient for fallen Man, nor for Society in this fallen State: Nor yet is <HI>the Religion of Mo&s;es,</HI> i. e. the Religion taught by him however well A|dapted to the &s;tate of the Jews of Old, &s;ufficient for us, or any Community now, in this Chri&s;tian State. But <HI>the Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which explains both the Former, and Supplys what is wanting in them, is Ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us Chri&s;tians, in this State of Chri&s;tianity, which, is the be&s;t Friend to civil Government of any &s;cheme of Religion at all. As it is be&s;t Calculated and Fitted to

Guide us into the way of Univer&s;al Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s: The Principles and Laws of it, being mo&s;t perfectly Adapted to the good Regulation of Individuals and Communities in all things, that affect their Duty and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IN a Word, <HI>the Religion,</HI> here Intended, as E&s;&s;ential to the Happine&s;s even of Society, is that which God has Revealed in his Word, in our Text, Expre&s;s'd by the <HI>Te&s;timony of I&s;rael</HI>: And now, the whole of that Re|vealed Religion, which the <HI>Go&s;pel Te&s;timony</HI> opens, con&s;i&s;ting in the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Laws of the Go&s;pel,</HI> and &s;o, in that <HI>practical Regard</HI> to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is there Taught and Recommended.</P>
<P>To &s;ay then,</P>
<P N="1">(1) The Religion &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the pre|&s;ent State is what con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>right Scriptu|ral Faith,</HI> the Faith of the Go&s;pel, Including both the <HI>Doctrines</HI> which it Teacheth, and our <HI>Belief</HI> of them. &mdash; The very Sy&s;tem of revealed Doctrines, which Comprehend and Perfect the Scheme of Principles, de|&s;ign'd to direct the Faith and govern the Life of Man, which are indeed the Principles Of Virtue and Godline&s;s leading Men to Happine&s;s. The&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary for us, as Individuals and Members of Society.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006868_0015_102A7F3FEEDE0C00">'TIS of great Con&s;equence how Men live, both on their own Account, and the Com|munity's of which, they are Members; which is mo&s;t likely to be according as their Principles are; whether good or bad; for, the&s;e are wont to have a great Influence on their Practice. And now, as the &s;acred Scriptures are de&s;igned to form right Prin|ciples in the minds of Men, to govern all their moral Conduct; &s;o to in&s;pire them with right generous Principles of Behaviour, in Church and State: For, who are indeed <HI>bad Men,</HI> and yet <HI>good Members</HI> of either of them? If their Principles are form'd by their Ignorance and Lu&s;ts, rather than by the great Rule of Faith and Duty; they will of cour&s;e be Irregular in Life, and Con|&s;equently, bad Members of Society. Their Conduct in <HI>the Church</HI> or <HI>common Wealth,</HI> will &s;avour of their corrupt Principles, and be prejudicial to the Health and Peace of Both. So that with Regard to Society, 'tis needful that Men have a right Scriptu|ral Faith, true Principles <HI>of Virtue and Godline&s;s</HI>; for, who knows not, that if Men have corrupt and loo&s;e Notions of <HI>the&s;e,</HI> they will be Prophane and Vicious, Uncharitable &amp; Unpeaceable, &amp; &s;ome kind of Libertines, or other? which &s;uits not with the good of Society. And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Men
<PB N="13" REF="006868_0016_102A7F435E272590">
will be well Regulated in their Manners, if they are not &s;o in their Belief? No. If they <HI>Err concerning the Faith,</HI> i. e. <HI>Err from the Truth</HI> in Principle, 'tis not pro|bable that they will <HI>do the Truth.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James 5.14 1 Joh. 1.6.</NOTE>, But, as it is &s;aid in another Ca&s;e, <HI>They err in Vi&s;ion, they &s;tumble in Judgment,</HI> and &s;o in Conduct <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 28.7.</NOTE> &s;o that any Scheme of Principles, that are not well adapted to mens own moral good Beha|viour, is not well calculated for the good of Society.</P>
<P>ARE the <HI>Errors of Popery,</HI> or <HI>the Wilds of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, &amp;c.</HI> friendly to Order &amp; Govern|ment in Church or State? No, But forever inimical thereto. And indeed, in whatever proportion Mens Notions of Religion and Chri&s;tianity, are fal&s;e, in the &s;ame they them|&s;elves will likely tran&s;gre&s;s the Rules there|of; and &s;o fail of that Virtue, Self-denial, Meekne&s;s, Con&s;tancy, public Spiritedne&s;s &amp; Benevolence which are repeatedly Recom|mended in the Go&s;pel: And &s;o of cour&s;e, di&s;turb the Peace &amp; Happine&s;s of the Com|munity, they belong unto. And how evident is it, that if Numbers therein, have very loo&s;e Notions of moral Virtue, they will fail of the practice of it, and tempt one another to tran&s;gre&s;s the Laws of it, in life;

and be di&s;hone&s;t, deceitful, &amp;c. and con&s;e|quently Mi&s;chievous to Society. It will be very natural to them to &s;hew a di&s;like of &s;trict Government; to be murmuring again&s;t good Laws, and faithful Rulers, who would con|troul their Lu&s;ts, and correct their Exorbi|tances: And &s;o they will be always inclin'd to abu&s;e their Privileges, and &s;acrifice them unto their own licentious Humours.</P>
<P>HENCE it &s;o often happens, that when men complain of the public &s;tate of Things, as if this, and that, was wanting to compleat the Privilege of a free People; the bottom of it is their own want of virtuous Principles of Conduct to form them good Members of Society.

prevailing Part being under the Influence of virtuous Principles, and in good Subjection to lawful Authority; why then, the Com|munity is very happy, and enjoys great Safe|ty and Tranquility.</P>
<P>So that I ob&s;erve, Not only &s;hould there be a Union of the&s;e Two great Intere&s;ts, actually Sub&s;i&s;ting by public Countenance, in a Community; but the Members thereof &s;hould be well United in their Regard to both; then it is indeed, <HI>as Jeru&s;alem, a City that is compact together</HI>: Cemented with Love, and other Social Virtues.

<P>INDEED, where mens Intere&s;t doth ly by them&s;elves, as in many the affairs of Life; there, to have different Sentiments &amp; Modes of Acting don't affect the Public State, don't make any Jarr in, or break upon the Community.

<P>The <HI>APPLICATION</HI> follows. And,</P>
<P>FIRST, By way of <HI>Inference.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hence,</HI> Learn that <HI>one great Bane</HI> of Society is mens Ignorance of the Nature of Society, or Unattention to the great De&s;igns thereof.</P>
<P>IF Per&s;ons are Ignorant of the Di&s;tinction there is between the State of Men; as <HI>Indi|viduals,</HI> and as <HI>Members</HI> of Community: If they are in&s;en&s;ible of the Bonds of Society, and the &s;acred Obligations ari&s;ing thence, to act with un&s;elfi&s;h, &s;teddy Views of the com|mon Good: But are ready to &s;eparate their own private Intere&s;t from that, and &s;o practi|cally Renounce their Relation to the Body Politic; this hurts it greatly. If they Ima|gine, they may &s;eek their own private Good, ab&s;tracted from any Regard to the whole Com|munity; or, as if their own particular In|tere&s;t mu&s;t be the Standard by which, to mea&s;ure the public Good; and hence, frame their Schemes of Conduct to &s;uit them, only, this is Mi&s;chievous to Society. For now, when they come to act as Members of So|ciety,
<PB N="49" REF="006868_0052_102A8E3EA4F44038">
the <HI>great Que&s;tion</HI> with them is, What is good for <HI>me?</HI> and what will &s;uit <HI>my In|tere&s;t?</HI> Not what is good for the <HI>Community,</HI> or proper for <HI>them</HI>? And this governs their Vote and Conduct; which is a Violation of the duty of Members, a betraying their Tru&s;t, and breaking their &s;olemn Bonds. For, at what Time, any particular Members are At|tach'd to their own Intere&s;t without Regard to and again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the whole; they practically break off from the Commu|nity and go back to a &s;tate of Nature; thus declaring for that, as Preferable to any other. And now, don't this Principle Naturally tend to Ill? For, each one acting &s;o, (as every one might on the &s;ame Principle) would de&s;troy the great ends of Society, and indeed the very Being of it. And this, I &s;uppo&s;e upon a ju&s;t Examination, will be found one great &s;pring of the hurtful Divi&s;ions in Church and State. This is what divides a Kingdom &amp; any Community again&s;t it &s;elf and &s;o De|&s;troys it.</P>
<P>BUT then further, we hence Learn <HI>another</HI> great Bane of Society is the want of Virtue and Religion therein. Not only do men hurt Society, when in public Affairs, they act as Individuals; but, and e&s;pecially when they act as open Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the divine Law, Indulge them&s;elves in Sin, in Deceit,
<PB N="50" REF="006868_0053_102A8E4044397F48">
Di&s;hone&s;ty, Intemperance, Litigiou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For, Sin is a great and mo&s;t awful Di&s;order in the Body Politick. And the more of it in particular Members, the more in the Body, which is weakn'd by the Prevalence of it in them.</P>
<P>AND, from whatever Quarter do come bitter Complaints of the Times, and of the public State of Things; this is truly the grand Source of all our Mi&s;chiefs, (<HI>viz.)</HI> our Sin, our low Regard to Virtue &amp; Religion, &amp; not making Con&s;cience of doing Ju&s;tly, living So|berly, and Frugally, and walking Humbly with God, and Charitably with one another. 'Tis our ca&s;ting Contempt on the Go&s;pel and In&s;titutions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, on his Name, Sabbaths, Mini&s;try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis our Under|valuing &amp; Abu&s;ing our precious Privileges, Civil and Religious, with our Uncharitable Contentions, Divi&s;ions, and Murmurings under the highe&s;t Liberties of any People upon the Face of the Earth; that &s;o weaken, wound and de&s;troy us: Verily, it is the&s;e Things that expo&s;e us to Ruin: The&s;e are our <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> and Threaten our <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, We Learn hence how much the <HI>Attention</HI> of a whole Community, &s;hould be Awakened to their own Recovery; to &s;eek it in all the Ways and Things &s;o E&s;&s;ential to the good of Society, <HI>(viz.</HI>) In

acting from that un&s;elfi&s;h Love, and noble public Spiritedne&s;s, which &s;hould for ever govern the Members of Society in their various Capacities, &amp; from Principles of &s;olid Virtue in all their Conduct. For, where there is not practical Righteou&s;ne&s;s among a People, they will be everla&s;tingly Unhappy. And all the Politicks in the World cannot &s;ave them: This cannot be Contriv'd, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s left out of the Scheme. But, va&s;tly great is the Advantage hereof in So|ciety, e&s;pecially when People are United in their Regard thereunto. This, on the one Hand, will guard again&s;t <HI>Tyranny,</HI> &amp; arbitrary Power in the <HI>civil Magi&s;trate</HI>; and on the other, again&s;t <HI>Sedition and Rebellion</HI> in the <HI>Subject,</HI> and &s;o again&s;t all tho&s;e Impious and Unpeaceable Methods of Conduct, which are &s;o prejudicial to the Public.</P>
<P>IF tho&s;e on the Thrones of Judgment, take their Mea&s;ures of Government from the Te&s;timony of I&s;rael, that will &s;ecure them from <HI>lawle&s;s Power:</HI> And if the People take their Mea&s;ures of Conduct from the Word of God al&s;o, that will Guard them again&s;t Di&s;obedience to <HI>lawful Authority.</HI> And &s;o both will keep their Place, and &s;erve the common Good.</P>
<P>AGAIN, We hence Learn, what a great <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to Society is <HI>a good Government.</HI>

One of a happy Con&s;titution, and wi&s;ely and faithfully Admini&s;tred. It has been tho't, that Government in &s;ome Re&s;pect bad, is better than none.

<P><PB N="61" REF="006868_0064_102A8E621BD6F018">A <HI>Religion</HI> which not only Teacheth, that there is A GOD whom <HI>as men,</HI> we are ca|pable of Knowing and Enjoying; and whom we are Everla&s;tingly Obliged to Love and Serve, &mdash; And <HI>as fallen Men</HI> we have bro|ken over the natural Obligations unto this: And that now, there are the&s;e Corruptions in our Nature as render us Unworthy of God, and Obnoxious to his Re&s;entments for Ever. &mdash; But, a <HI>Religion,</HI> that al&s;o Teach|eth, that there is A SAVIOUR provided for us, that JESUS CHRIST the Son and Me&s;&s;enger of God is this Saviour, and the only Redeemer of Man. &mdash; A <HI>Religion</HI> that In&s;tructs us in the Method of Salvation by Him, thro' his Perfect Obedience and Pro|pitiatory Sacrifice; the only &s;ufficient Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s for us, and compleatly Effectual unto the Salvation of all that Believe.&mdash; A <HI>Reli|gion,</HI> that opens the Way of mens Obtaining this Faith which is Saving, by the Te&s;|timony of God, concerning his Son, and the Influence of the Holy Spirit, which alone Applys the Word, E&s;pecially, the Word Preached for this End. &mdash; A <HI>Religion,</HI> that Exhibits the Encouragement and War|rant for Faith in Chri&s;t; not from any Thing in our &s;elves, but from the Grace of the Go&s;pel, the Word of a God Inviting us to come to Chri&s;t not with &s;tanding all our Sins
<PB N="62" REF="006868_0065_102A8E64062DE4D8">
and Unworthine&s;s, that we may be Saved from our Sins, the Guilt, the Filth, the Power and Fruits thereof. &mdash;</P>
<P>MOREOVER, A <HI>Religion,</HI> that Enforceth all the Moral Obligations to Virtue and Holine&s;s with &s;ome New Sanctions, and Motives peculiar to a Go&s;pel State, which the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of God hath Given, in the New Te&s;tament for that End.</P>
<P><HI>And,</HI> now my Brethren, to promote &s;uch a Religion, as Forms Men for God and So|ciety, is to &s;erve both the Intere&s;t of the Church and the State al&s;o; for, the more Truly and Practically <HI>Religious,</HI> men are, the more <HI>Orderly</HI> in the State. This then let us do, and labour in, Spend and be Spent, in this Service, for the Good of <HI>Souls</HI> and of <HI>Society.</HI> &mdash; In the mean Time <HI>keeping</HI> well <HI>our own Vineyard,</HI> looking well to the State of our own Souls; &s;eeing to it, that we are the Subjects of the Religion which we rightly Preach to others, and that we Live and Shine in all the Exerci&s;es of it; as Exam|ples unto others, more and more bright and worthly of Imitation: That the latter part of our Day may be the Brighte&s;t, and our Sun Set, not in a Cloud, but in the Dawn of Eternal Day.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="006868_0066_102A8E660A90F0D8">TO CONCLUDE,</P>
<P>Let all this A&s;&s;embly <HI>Know A&s;&s;uredly,</HI> that they mu&s;t all be Subject unto the Laws of God, to the Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; unto who&s;e Tribunal We are all Accountable, and mu&s;t give Account. &mdash; And now to the Care of our own Souls, let us add all ju&s;t Concern for the Pro&s;perity of the Church and the State. And Earne&s;tly <HI>Pray for the Peace of Jeru&s;alem: For they &s;hall pro&s;per that Love thee.</HI> Say we then every one of us, <HI>Peace be within thy Walls, and Pro&s;perity within thy Palaces.</HI></P>
