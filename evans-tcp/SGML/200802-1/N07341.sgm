<P>AMong&s;t the many Calamities with which the Al|mighty is plea&s;ed to vi&s;it the Children of Men, in order to reduce them to a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of their own Weak|ne&s;s and entire Dependance upon him, there is &s;carce any that are more productive of true penitent Humilia|tion and of a Sight of what is really good and truly Evil, than tho&s;e contagious Di&s;tempers which, an offen|ded God &s;ometimes, &s;uffers to rage among&s;t the People. In the Year 1665 the City of LONDON was &s;orely vi&s;i|ted by the Plague: An Account of the Progre&s;s and Effects of that Vi&s;itation was kept by a Citizen who re|mained there during the whole Time of the Sickne&s;s, and appears to have been candid and judicious in his Remarks thereon. I tru&s;t my Readers may, in a &s;hort De&s;cription of that memorable Judgment, meet with &s;uch Le&s;&s;ons of be&s;t Wi&s;dom, which nothing can &s;o ef|fectually produce, as a clo&s;e and &s;erious conver&s;e with Death and the Grave. The Introduction of this Con|tagion in LONDON was by &s;ome Goods imported from HOLLAND, which had been brought thither from the Le|vant. It fir&s;t broke out in the Hou&s;e where tho&s;e Goods were opened, from whence it &s;pread to other Hou&s;es. In the fir&s;t Hou&s;e that was infected there died four Per|&s;ons: A Neighbour who went to vi&s;it them returning home gave the Di&s;temper to her Family, and died with all her Hou&s;hold. The Pari&s;h Officers who were em|ploy'd about the &s;ick Per&s;ons being al&s;o infected, the Phy|&s;icians perceived the Danger, and upon narrow In&s;pection a&s;&s;ured, that it was indeed the Plague with all is terrify|ing Particulars, &amp; that it threatned a general Infection. The People began now to be allarmed all over the Town; the u&s;ual Number of Burials within the Bills of Mortali|ty for a Week were generally about 240 to 300, but from the 27th. to the 24 Jan. the printed Bill was 474. How|ever this went off again, and the Fro&s;t continuing very
<PB N="3" REF="009373_0003_1031C2648B8CF860">
&s;evere, till near the End of February the Bills decrea&s;ed again and People began to look upon the Danger as good as over; but in May the Bills greatly encrea&s;ed, and the Weather becoming hot, the Infection &s;pread again, in a dreadful Manner.</P>
<P>I lived, &s;ays the Author, without Aldgate, and as the Di&s;temper had not reached to that Side of the City, our Neighbourhood continued ea&s;y; but at the other End of the Town the Con&s;ternation was very great; and the Nobility &amp; Gentry thronged out of the Town, with their Families in an unu&s;ual Manner; nothing was to be &s;een but Waggons, Carts, and Coaches, with Goods and People and Hor&s;e-Men attending them, hurrying away; then empty Waggons and Carts appeared, who were apparently returning to fetch more People: Be&s;ides innumerable Numbers of People on Hor&s;eback, fitted out for travelling. This was a very melancholly Pro&s;pect; indeed there was nothing el&s;e of Moment to be &s;een, it filled my mind with very &s;erious Thoughts of the Mi&s;e|ry that was coming upon the City, and the unhappy Con|dition of tho&s;e that would be left in it. By the End of July the Contagion had &s;pread and encrea&s;ed to a great Degree: Sorrow and Sadne&s;s &s;at upon every Face; and tho' &s;ome Parts were not yet overwhelmed, all looked deeply concerned. LONDON might well be &s;aid to be all in Tears, the Mourners did not go about the Streets, for no body made a formal Dre&s;s of Mourning for their neare&s;t Relations; but the Voice of Mourning, was in|deed, heard in the Streets; the Shrieks of Women and Children at the Windows and Doors of their Hou&s;es, where their deare&s;t Relations were dying, were &s;o fre|quent to be heard, as we pa&s;&s;ed the Streets, that it was enough to pierce the &s;toute&s;t Heart in the World. Tears and Lamentations were &s;een almo&s;t in every Hou&s;e, e&s;pe|cially in the fir&s;t Part of the Vi&s;itation; for towards the latter End People did not &s;o much concern them&s;elves for the lo&s;s of their Friends, expecting, that them&s;elves &s;hould be &s;ummoned the next Hour.</P>
<P>It was a Time of very unhappy Breaches among&s;t us, in Matters of Religion, Divi&s;ions &amp; &s;eparate Opini|ons
<PB N="4" REF="009373_0004_1031C2661486F970">
prevailed; the Church of ENGLAND was lately re&s;tored, and the Pre&s;byterians &amp; other Profe&s;&s;ions had &s;et up their Meetings for wor&s;hip, and apart, in which they were frequently di&s;turbed, the Government endea|voring to &s;uppre&s;s their Meetings. But this dreadful Vi&s;itation reconciled the different Parties and took a|way all Manner of Prejudice and Scruple from the Peo|ple. But after the Sickne&s;s was over, that Spirit of Chari|ty &s;ub&s;ided, and Things returned to their own Channel again. Here we may ob&s;erve, that a nearer View of Death would &s;oon reconcile Men, of good Principles, to one another, and that it is chiefly owing to our ea&s;y Situati|ons in Life, and our putting the&s;e Things far from us, that our Breaches are fomented, and that there is &s;o much Prejudice and want of Chri&s;tian Charity and Union among&s;t us. A clo&s;e View and Conver&s;e with Death, or with Di&s;ea&s;es that threaten Death, would &s;cum off the Gall of our Temper, remove our Animo&s;ities, and bring us to &s;ee with different Eyes. On the other Side of the Grave we &s;hall all be Brethren again.</P>
<P>The Inns of Court were now all &s;hut up, there was but few Lawyers to be &s;een in the City, indeed there was no need of them, for Quarrels and Divi&s;ions about Intere&s;t had cea&s;ed; every Body was at Peace.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o worthy of Ob&s;ervation, as well as fruit|ful of In&s;truction, to ob&s;erve with what Alacrity the People, of all Per&s;ua&s;ions, embraced the Opportunities they had of attending upon the publick Wor&s;hip, and other appointed Times of Devotion, as Humiliations, Fa&s;tings and publick Confe&s;&s;ion of Sins, to implore the Mercy of GOD and avert the Judgment which hung over their Heads. The Churches were &s;o thronged that there was, often, no coming near, no, not to the very Door of the large&s;t Churches. There was al&s;o dai|ly Prayers appointed Morning and Evening, at which the People attended with uncommon Devotion.</P>
<P>All Plays and Interludes which had lately began to encrea&s;e among&s;t us, were forbid to act; the Gaming-Tables, publick Dancing-Rooms, and Mu&s;ic-Hou&s;es, which multiplied and began to debauch the Manners of
<PB N="5" REF="009373_0005_1031C26838205CC8">
the People were &s;hut up and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; finding indeed no Trade, for the Minds of the People were generally humbled and agitated with other Things, Death was before their Eyes, and every Body began to think of their Graves.</P>
<P>The Infection &s;till gradually encrea&s;ed till the Middle of Augu&s;t, when there died a Thou&s;and a Day, by Ac|count or the weekly Bills, tho' they never gave a full Account by many Thou&s;ands, many of the Pari&s;h Offi|cers were taken &s;ick them&s;elves and died when their Ac|count was to be given in. The Pari&s;h of Stepney alone had within the Year, one Hundred &amp; &s;ixteen Sextons, Gra|ve-Diggers and Carriers of the Dead &amp;c. Indeed the Work was not of a Nature to allow them lei&s;ure to take an exact tale of the dead Bodies, which were all thrown together in the Dark in a Pit, to which no Man could come near without the utmo&s;t Peril.</P>
<P>I had, &s;ays the Author, the Care of my Brother's Hou|&s;e which obliged me &s;ometimes to go abroad. In the&s;e Walks I had di&s;mal Scenes before my Eyes, as, parti|cularly, of Per&s;ons falling dead in the Streets, terrible Shrieks of Women, who in their Agonies would throw open their Chamber-Windows, &amp; cry out in a di&s;mal &s;ur|prizing Manner; it is impo&s;&s;ible, to de&s;cribe the variety of Po&s;tures in which the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Poor People would expre&s;s them&s;elves. Pa&s;&s;ing thro' Token Hou&s;e Yard, of a &s;udden a Ca&s;ement violently opened ju&s;t over my Head, and a Woman gave three frightful Screeches, and then cry'd: <HI>Oh! Death, Death, Death,</HI> which &s;truck me with Horror and a chilne&s;s in my very Blood. There was no Body to be &s;een in the whole Street, neither did any Window open, for People had no Curio&s;ity, now, in any Ca&s;e. I went on to pa&s;s into <HI>Bell-Ally,</HI> where there was a greater Cry than that, I could hear Women and Children run &s;kreaming about the Rooms like di&s;tracted; when a Garret Window opened and &s;ome Body from a Window on the other Side, a&s;ked: What is the Matter? Upon which it was an&s;wered: <HI>O Lord! My old Ma&s;ter has hanged him&s;elf.</HI> The other a&s;ked a|gain: <HI>Is be quite dead?</HI> And the fir&s;t an&s;wered: <HI>Ay, Ay,
<PB N="6" REF="009373_0006_1031C26A4C502920">
quite dead and cold.</HI> This Per&s;on was a Deputy Alderman and very rich: But this is but one In&s;tance; it is &s;carce credible, what dreadful Ca&s;es happened in particular Fa|milies every Day: People in the Rage of the Di&s;temper or in the Torment of the Swelling, which was indeed intolerable, becoming raving and di&s;tracted, often times laid violent Hands upon them&s;elves, throwing them&s;el|ves out of Windows, or breaking out of the Hou&s;es, would dance naked about the Streets not knowing one exta&s;ie from another; others, if not prevented, would run directly down the River &amp; plunge into the Wa|ter. Some dying of meer Grief as a Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome of Fright and Surprize, without having received the Infection. It often pierced my very Soul, to hear the Groans and Cries of tho&s;e who were thus tormented; but this of the Swellings was accounted the mo&s;t promi&s;ing particular in the whole Infection, for if the&s;e &s;wellings could be brought to break and run, the Patient generally recovered. Whereas tho&s;e who were &s;truck with Death at the Beginning of the Di&s;temper, and had Spots come up|on them, often went about indifferent ea&s;y, till a little before they died, and &s;ome till the Moment they dropt down; &s;uch would be taken &s;uddenly very &s;ick, and would run to &s;ome convenient Place, or to their own Hou&s;es, if po&s;&s;ible, and there &s;it down, grow faint and die. The Method the Magi&s;trates fell into of locking up the Doors of People's Hou&s;es where any had taken the Di&s;temper, and &s;etting Watchmen there Night and Day, to prevent any going out to &s;pread the Infection, looked hard and cruel, as, perhaps, tho&s;e who were found in the Family might have e&s;caped, if they had been removed from the &s;ick; but the pub|lick good &s;eem'd to ju&s;tify &s;uch a Conduct, and there was no obtaining the lea&s;t Mitigation by any Ap|plication to the Magi&s;trates. This put People, who thought them&s;elves well, upon many Stratagems to get out of their Confinements. Going out one Morn|ing, I heard a great Outcry, which prompting my Cu|rio&s;ity. I inquired the Cau&s;e of a Per&s;on who looked
<PB N="7" REF="009373_0007_1031C26BCF304A58">
out of a Window. A Watchman had been employ'd to watch at the Door of a Hou&s;e, which was infected and &s;hut up, both him&s;elf and the Day Watchman at|tended there a Day and two Nights. All this while no Noi&s;e had been heared, nor Lights &s;een in the Hou&s;e; neither had they called for any Thing; it &s;eems that two or three Days before, the Dead-Cart had &s;top't there, and a Servant-Maid had been brought down to the Door dead, wrapt only in a green Rug, which the Buriers had put into the Cart and carried away: The next Day the Watchman heared great Crying and &s;creeming in the Hou&s;e, which he &s;uppo|&s;ed was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome of the Family dying ju&s;t at that Time; upon which he knocked at the Door a great while, at la&s;t one looked out, and &s;aid with an angry quick Tone, and a Voice of one that was crying, <HI>what d'ye want, that ye make &s;uch a knocking?</HI> He an&s;wered: <HI>I am the Watchman: How do you do? What is the Matter?</HI> The Per&s;on an&s;wered: <HI>What is that to you? Stop the Dead-Cart.</HI> This was about one o'Clock; &s;oon after, he &s;topt the Dead-Cart, and then knock'd again, but no Body an&s;wered: He continued knocking, and the Bellman called &s;everal Times: <HI>Bring out your Dead;</HI> but no Body an&s;wered, till the Man that drove the Cart, being called to other Hou&s;es, would &s;tay no longer, and drove away. In the Morning when the Day-Watchman came in, they knock't at the Door a great while, but no Body an&s;wering, they got a Ladder, and one of them went up to the Window, &amp; looking into the Room, he &s;aw a Woman lying dead upon the Floor, in a di&s;mal Manner: But tho' he called aloud &amp; knocked hard on the Floor, with his Staff, no Body &s;tirr'd or an&s;wered: This they made known to the Magi&s;trate, who ordered the Hou&s;e to be broken open, when no Body was found in the Hou&s;e, but that young Wo|man, who having been infected, and pa&s;t Recovery, the Re&s;t had left her to die by her&s;elf, and were every one gone, having found &s;ome Way to delude the Watchman, and go out; as to tho&s;e Cries, and Shrieks, which he heared, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, they were the pa&s;&s;ion|ate
<PB N="8" REF="009373_0008_1031C26E941069E0">
Cries of the Family, at the bitter parting, which, to be &s;ure, it was to them all; this being the Si&s;ter to the Mi&s;tri&s;s of the Family. Many more In&s;tances might be giv|en but the&s;e may &s;uffice to &s;hew the deep Di&s;tre&s;s of that Day. Death did not now hover over every one's Head only, but looked into their Hou&s;es and Chambers, and even &s;tared in their very Faces, and tho' there was &s;ome Stupidity and Dulne&s;s of Mind; yet there was a great Deal of ju&s;t Alarm &s;ounded in the inmo&s;t Soul: Many Con&s;ciences were awakened: many hard Hearts melt|ed into Tears; many a penitent Confe&s;&s;ion was made of Crimes long concealed. People might be heared even in the Streets as we pa&s;&s;ed along calling upon GOD for Mercy, thro' JESUS CHRIST, and &s;aying: I have been a Thief. I have been an Adulterer. I have been a Murderer, and the like; and none dur&s;t &s;top to make Inquiry into &s;uch Things, or to admini&s;ter. Comfort to the poor Creature, who in the angui&s;h both of Soul and Body thus cried out: Many were the Warnings that were then given by dying Penitents, to others, not to put off and delay their Repentance to a Day of Di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;uch a Time of Calamity as this was no Time for Repentance. I wi&s;h, &s;ays the Author, I could repeat the very Sound of tho&s;e Groans and Exclamations that I heared from &s;ome poor dying Creatures, when in the heighth of their Agonies and Di&s;tre&s;s; and that I could make him that reads this hear as, I imagine, I now hear them, for the Sound &s;eems &s;till to ring in my Ears. In the Beginning of September the Number of Burials increa&s;ing, the Church-Wardens of Aldgate Pari&s;h ordered a large Pit to be dug, to hold all the Dead which might die in a Month, it was about forty Foot long and &s;ixteen broad; &s;ome blamed the Church-Wardens for &s;uffering &s;uch a frightful Gulf to be dug; neverthele&s;s in two Weeks they had thrown more than eleven Hundred Bodies into it, when they were obliged to fill it up, as the Bodies were come within 6 Foot of the Surface. My Curio&s;i|ty drove me to go, &amp; &s;ee this Pit, when there had been near four hundred People buried in it. I got Admit|tance
<PB N="9" REF="009373_0009_1031C270C32AFD48">
into the Church-Yard, by means of the Sexton, who was a &s;en&s;ible, religious Man; he would have per&s;uad|ed me not to go, &s;aying: <HI>"That it was, indeed, their Duty to venture, and in it they might hope to be pre&s;erved; but that as I had no apparent call, he thought my Curio&s;i|ty could not ju&s;tify my running that</HI> Hazard" I told him, <HI>I had been pre&s;&s;ed in my Mind</HI> to go, <HI>and that perhaps it might be an in&s;tructing Sight</HI> "Nay <HI>"Says</HI> "the good Man <HI>"If you will venture upon that Score, in the Name of GOD go in; it will be a Sermon to you, it may be the be&s;t that ever you heared in your Life"</HI> His Di&s;cour&s;es had &s;hock't my Re&s;olution and I &s;tood wavering for a good while; but ju&s;t then I heared the Bell-Man, and the Cart, loaded with dead Bodies, appearing, I went in. There was no Body, as I could perceive, at fir&s;t, with the Cart but the Buriers, and the Man that led the Cart, but when they came to the Pit, they &s;aw a Man mufled in a Cloak who appeared in great agony; the Buriers immediately gathered about him, &s;uppo&s;ing he was one of tho&s;e poor delirious or de&s;perate Crea|tures, that would &s;ometimes run to the Pit, wrapt in Blankets, and throw them&s;elves in, and as they &s;aid, bury them&s;elves. When the Buriers came to him, they &s;oon found he was neither de&s;perate nor di&s;tempered in Mind, but one oppre&s;&s;ed with a dreadful Weight of Grief, having his Wife and &s;everal Children all in the Cart, that was ju&s;t come in with him, and he followed in Agony and exce&s;s of Sorrow. He calmly de&s;ired the Buriers to let him alone, &s;aid he would only &s;ee the Bodies thrown in &amp; go away, &s;o they left importuning him; but no &s;ooner was the Cart turned round, and the Bodies &s;hot into the Pit promi&s;cuou&s;ly, which was a Surprize to him, for he at lea&s;t expected, they would have been decently laid in, tho' indeed he was after|wards convinced that was impracticable, I &s;ay, no &s;oon|er did he &s;ee the Sight, but he cry'd out aloud, unable to contain him&s;elf, and fell down in a Swoon; the Buriers ran to him, and took him up, and when he was come to him&s;elf, led him to a Place were he was taken Care of. He looked into the Pit again, as he
<PB N="10" REF="009373_0010_1031C27247C83000">
went away, but the Buriers had covered the Bodies, &s;o immediately, with throwing Earth that nothing could be &s;een. The Cart had in it &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen Bodies. Some were wrapt up in Linen Sheets, &s;ome in Rugs, &s;ome little other than naked, or &s;o loo&s;e, that what Covering they had fell from them, in the &s;hoot|ing out of the Cart, and they fell quite naked among the re&s;t; but the Matter was not much to them, or the Indecency much to any one el&s;e, &s;eeing they were to be huddled together into the common Grave of Mankind, for here was no Difference made, but Poor and Rich went together; there was no other Way of Burials, nei|ther was it po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould.</P>
<P><HI>John Hayward</HI> under-Sexton, that is Grave-Digger and Bearer of the Dead, never had the Di&s;temper at all, but lived about twenty Years after it. His Wife was imployed to nur&s;e the infected People; yet &s;he her&s;elf never was infected. The only Pre&s;ervative he u&s;ed, again&s;t the Infection, was holding Garlick and Rue in his Mouth and &s;moaking Tobacco; this I had from his own Mouth. His Wife's Remedy was wa|&s;hing her Head in Vinegar, and &s;prinkling her Head-Cloths &s;o with Vinegar, as to keep them always moi&s;t; and if the Smell of any of tho&s;e &s;he waited on was more than ordinary offen&s;ive, &s;he &s;nuft Vinegar up into her No&s;e, &s;prinkled her Headcloths and held a Handkerchief wet|ed with Vinegar to her Mouth.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the Di&s;po|&s;ition of the People of that Day, with Re&s;pect to their Charity to the Poor, which indeed was very large both in a publick and a private Way. Some pious Ladies were &s;o zealous in this good Work, and &s;o confident in the Protection of Providence in the Di&s;charge of this great Duty, that they went about them&s;elves di&s;tribut|ing Alms, and vi&s;iting the poor Families that were in|fected, in their very Hou&s;es, appointing Nur&s;es and Apothecaries to &s;upply them with what they wanted. Thus giving their Ble&s;&s;ings to the Poor in &s;ub&s;tantial Relief, as well as hearty Prayers for them. I will not undertake to &s;ay, that none of the&s;e charitable People
<PB N="11" REF="009373_0011_1031C27489B85B88">
were &s;uffered to die of the Plague, but this I may &s;ay, that I never knew any of them mi&s;carried, which I mention for the Encouragement of others in Ca&s;e of like Di&s;tre&s;s; and doubtle&s;s, if they, <HI>"that give to the Poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay it"</HI> tho&s;e that hazard their Lives to give to the Poor, and to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;uch a Mi&s;ery as this, may hope to be pro|tected therein.</P>
<P>From the Middle of Augu&s;t to the Middle of Sep|tember the Infection &s;till encrea&s;ed and &s;pread it&s;elf, with an irre&s;i&s;tible Fury, it was reckoned that during that Time there died no le&s;s than &s;ixteen Hundred a Day, one Day with another. It was then that the Confu&s;ion and Terror was inexpre&s;&s;ible; the Courage of the People appointed to carry away the Dead, be|gan to fail them: The Vigilance of the Magi&s;trates was now put to the utmo&s;t Trial. At la&s;t the violence of the Di&s;temper came to &s;uch a height that the People &s;at &s;till looking at one another, and &s;eemed quite abandoned to De&s;pair. In a Word, People began to give them&s;elves up to a fear, that there was nothing to be expected, but a univer&s;al De&s;olation. This De|&s;pair made People bold and venturous, they were no more &s;hy of one another, as expecting there was now no avoiding the Di&s;temper, but that all mu&s;t go, this brought them to crow'd into the Churches, they inqui|red no more what Condition the People, who &s;at near them, was in, but looking upon them&s;elves all as &s;o many dead Corps, they came to the Churches without the lea&s;t Caution, and crowded together, as if their Lives were of no Con&s;equence, compared to the Work which they were come about: Indeed, their Zeal in coming, and the Earne&s;tne&s;s and affectionate Atten|tion they &s;hewed to what they heared, made it mani|fe&s;t, what Value People would put upon the Wor|&s;hip of GOD, if they thought, every Day they attended at the Church, would be their la&s;t. It was in the Height of this De&s;pair, that it plea&s;ed God to &s;tay his Hand, and to &s;lacken the Fury of the Contagion, in a Manner as &s;urprizing as that of its Beginning, and which de|mon&s;trated
<PB N="12" REF="009373_0012_1031C276CF5892D8">
it to be his own particular Hand above the Agency of Means; nothing but omnipotent Power could have done it; the Contagion de&s;pi&s;ed all Medi|cine. Death raged in every Corner, and had it gone on as it did then, a few Weeks more would have cleared the Town of all its Inhabitants. In that very Moment when thirty Thou&s;and were dead in three Weeks, nay, when it was reported three Thou&s;and had died in one Night, and an Hundred Thou&s;and more were taken &s;ick, when we might well &s;ay: <HI>Vain was the Help of Man,</HI> it plea&s;ed God to cau&s;e the Fury of it to abate; and by his immediate Hand to di&s;arm the Enemy. It was wonderful! The Phy&s;icians were &s;urprized, wherever they vi&s;ited, to find their Patients better, and in a few Days every Body was recovering: Nor was this by any Medicine found out, or any new Method of Cure di&s;covered, but it was evidently from the Secret invi|&s;ible Hand of him, that had at fir&s;t &s;ent this Di&s;ea&s;e, as a Judgment upon us. Let the Philo&s;ophers &s;earch for Rea&s;ons in Nature to Account for it, and labour as much as they will to le&s;&s;en the Debt they owe to their Maker; tho&s;e Phy&s;icians who had the lea&s;t Share of Religion in them were obliged to acknowledge that it was all &s;upernatural. The Streets were now full of poor recovering Creatures, who appeared very &s;en&s;ible &amp; thankful to God for their unexpected Deliverance: Yet I mu&s;t own, that as for the generality of the People it might too ju&s;tly be &s;aid of them, as was &s;aid of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> after they had been delivered from the Ho&s;t of <HI>Pharaoh.

<P>The Author who was pre&s;erved unhurt, with his whole Family during the Time of the Sickne&s;s, gives, in his Memoirs, a particular Account of the many Rea&s;onings and Fears which affected his Mind, before he could come to a fixed Conclu&s;ion, whether to &s;tay, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his Lot in the Station in which God had placed him, or by leaving the City run the Hazard of un&s;ettling him&s;elf, and lo&s;e his Effects, which lay &s;cat|tered among&s;t the Merchants.

of his Brother he had concluded to go, but being always cro&s;&s;ed in this De&s;ign, by &s;everal Acci|dents, it came, one Morning, as he expre&s;&s;es it, very warmly in his Mind, whether the&s;e repeated Di&s;appoint|ments, were not Intimations to him, that it was the Will of Heaven he &s;hould not go, which was &s;ucceed|ed by a farther Thought, that if this Sugge&s;tion was from God, he was able effectually to pre&s;erve him in the mid&s;t of all Deaths and Dangers that would &s;ur|round him, and that if he attempted to &s;ecure him|&s;elf, by fleeing from his Habitation and acted con|trary to the&s;e Intimations, which he believed to be divine, it was a kind of flying from GOD, who could cau&s;e his ju&s;tice to overtake him, when, and where he thought fit.</P>
<P>But what finally fixed him in a Re&s;olution to &s;tay, and ca&s;t him&s;elf, entirely upon the Protecton and good Plea&s;ure of the Almighty, was, that at a Time, when his Thoughts were more than commonly &s;erious up|on this weighty Subject, turning over the Bible which lay before him, he cry'd out: <HI>Well, I know not what to do, Lord, direct me!</HI> at that Juncture happening to &s;top and ca&s;ting his Eye on the Second Ver&s;e of 91&s;t.

THe In&s;piration of God, and the clear Information of the Holy Scriptures a&s;&s;ures us, that God re&s;erves his choice&s;t Secrets for the pure&s;t Minds, and that it is uncleanne&s;s of Spirit, not dif|ference of Method in &s;eeking after God, that &s;eparates us from him; true Holine&s;s being the only &s;afe Entrance into divine Know|ledge. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> declares Act. 10, 34. <HI>That he perceived of a Truth that God is no re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons: But in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s is accepted with him.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o tells the <HI>Galatians</HI> Chap. 6, 15. <HI>That in Chri&s;t Je&s;us neither Circumci&s;ion availeth any Thing, nor Uncircumci&s;ion, but a new Creature.</HI> Nothwith&s;tanding the Clearne&s;s of the&s;e and many more &s;uch Doctrines contained in the Scriptures, Selfi&s;hne&s;s &amp; Partia|lity, tho&s;e inhuman and ba&s;e Qualities have been &s;uffered to pre|vail even among&s;t &s;uch, as are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t pious in the &s;e|veral Sects and Parties of the Chri&s;tian Church: They have rai&s;ed and &s;till rai&s;e in every Communion, a &s;elfi&s;h partial Orthodoxy, which con&s;i&s;ts in courageou&s;ly defending all its Opinions and Practices, and condemning the Doctrines and Practices of others; and thus every one is train'd up in Defence of their own Church, their own Truth, their own Opinion: And he often is judged to have the mo&s;t Merit, and the mo&s;t Honour, who likes every Thing, and defends every&punc; Thing among&s;t them&s;elves, and leaves nothing uncen&s;ured in tho&s;e that are of a different Communion. Now how can Truth, Goodne&s;s and Religion be more &s;truck at, than by &s;uch Defenders of it? If you a&s;k why the great Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> wrote &s;o many learned Books again&s;t all Parts of the Reformation, it is becau&s;e he was born in <HI>France.</HI> Had he been born in <HI>England,</HI> had he been bred at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he might have re|vall'd our great Bi&s;hop <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> and would have wrote as many learn'd Folio's again&s;t the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as he has done. And yet I will venture to &s;ay, that if each Church could produce but one Man a Piece, that had the Piety of an Apo&s;tle, and the impartial Love of that fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, they would not want half a Sheet of Paper to hold their Articles of Union, nor be half an Hour before they were of one Religion. If we loved Truth as &s;uch; if we &s;ought it for its own &s;ake; if we loved our neigh|bours as our &s;elves; if we de&s;ir'd nothing by our Religion but to be acceptable to God; if we equally de&s;ir'd the Salvation of all Men; if we were afraid of Error, only becau&s;e of its hurt|ful Nature to us, and our Brethern of other Communions, then nothing of this Spirit could have any Place in us. <HI>For God is Love, and they which dwell in God, they dwell in Love,</HI> 1 <HI>John.</HI> 4, 16. That univer&s;al Love which gives the whole Strength of the Heart to God, and which makes us love every Man as we love our&s;elves is the noble&s;t, the mo&s;t divine, and God-like State of the Soul, and no Religion does any Man any good, but &s;o far, as it brings this perfect Love with it. Perfection can no where be found, but in a pure di&s;intere&s;ted Love of God and our Neighbour. There is

therefore a Commnuion of Saints in the Love of GOD, which no one can learn from that which is called Orthodoxy in the dif|ferent Sects, but is only to be had by a total Dying to all world|ly Views, by a pure Love of GOD, and by &s;uch an Unction from above, as delivers the Mind from all Selfi&s;hne&s;s, and makes it love Truth and Goodne&s;s, with an Equallity of Affection in every Man, let his Name and Profe&s;&s;ion to Religion be what it may. And by thus uniting in Heart and Spirit with all that is holy and good in all profe&s;&s;ions, we enter into the true Communion of Saints, and become real Members of the true univer&s;al Chri&s;tian Church, tho' we are confin'd to the outward Wor&s;hip of only one particular Part of it. It is thus, that the Angels, as mini|&s;tring Spirits a&s;&s;i&s;t, join, unite and co-operate with every Thing that is holy and good in every Divi&s;ion of Mankind, He that has been all his Life long u&s;ed to look with great Slight upon tho&s;e of other Profe&s;&s;ions, whom he has called <HI>Super&s;titions, Biggots, canting Enthu&s;ia&s;ts &amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t naturally expect, they will be treated by GOD, as they have been by him; and if he had the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, &s;uch People woold find it hard, to get a Place in it. But it &s;tands greatly in Hand to get rid of this Temper before we dye; for if nothing but univer&s;al Love can enter into the Kingdom of GOD, what can be more nece&s;&s;ary for us, than to be full of this Love before we dye?</P>
<P>We often hear of People of great Zeal declaring on their Death-Beds their &s;trict Attachment to the Church of England, and making &s;olemn Prote&s;tations again&s;t all other Churches, but how much better would it be, if &s;uch a Per&s;on was to &s;ay: <Q>In this divided State of Chri&s;tendom, I mu&s;t conform to &s;ome outward divided Part of it, and therefore I have cho&s;en to live and dye in outward Communion with the church of Eng|land; fully believing, that if I wor&s;hip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, in this divided Part of the Church, I &s;hall be as accep|table to him, as if I had been a faithful Member of the one whole Church, before it was broken into &s;eparate Parts. But as I am now going out of this di&s;ordered Divi&s;ion, into a more univer&s;al State of Things, as I am going to the GOD of all Churches, to a Kingdom of univer&s;al Love, which mu&s;t have its Inhabitants from all People, Nations, and Languages of the Earth; &s;o in this Spirit of univer&s;al Love, I de&s;ire to perform my la&s;t Act of Communion joyning in Heart and Spirit with all that is Chri&s;tian, Holy and Good in all other Chur|ches; praying, from the Bottom of my Soul, that every Church may have its Saints; that GOD'S Kingdom may come, his Will be done in every Divi&s;ion of Chri&s;tians and Men, and that every Thing that hath Breath, may prai&s;e the Lord.</Q></P>

AN Eminent Servant of GOD who had known Deliverance from the Dark Powers and experimentally felt the Powers of the World to come, a few Hours before his Death, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following Words: <Q>There is a Spirit which I feel, that delights to do no Evil, nor to revenge any wrong&punc; but delights to endure all Things, in Hopes to enjoy its own in the End; Its Hope is&punc; to outlive all Wrath and Contention, and to weary out all Exaltation and Cruelty, or what&s;oever is of a Nature contrary to it&s;elf; it &s;ees to the End of all Temptations; as it bears no Evil in it &s;elf, &s;o it conceives none in Thought to any other; for its Ground and Spring is the Mercies and Forgivene&s;s of GOD; its Crown is Meekne&s;s; its Life is everla&s;ting Love unfeigned, and takes its Kingdom with Intreaty, and not with Contention, and keeps it by lowline&s;s of Mind; in GOD alone it can rejoice, tho' none el&s;e regard it, or can own its Life; 'tis conceived in Sorrow, and brought forth without any to pity it, nor doth it murmur at Grief and Oppre&s;&s;ion; it never rejoiceth but thro' Sufferings, for with the World's Joy it is murdered. I found it alone being for&s;aken: I have Fellow&s;hip therein with tho&s;e that lived in Dens and de&s;olate Places of the Earth, who through Death obtained Re&s;urrection and eternal holy Life.</Q></P>
