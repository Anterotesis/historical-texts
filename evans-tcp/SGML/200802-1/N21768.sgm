<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EVER indulgent to the weakest emanations of genius, a benevolent public has enabled the author of BELISARIUS to bring forward her first Dramatic Per|formance; and though it may not be as perfect as those pieces which are produced by authors who have paid long and strict attention to the Theatre, yet she flatters herself, that as an historical Tragedy, it will meet with a kind reception.</P>
<P>She has endeavoured to avoid all that unmeaning <HI>rant</HI> which forms so conspicuous a part in most productions of this kind, together with the awful <HI>asseverations</HI> and <HI>maledictions.</HI>&mdash;What their effect upon the <HI>stage</HI> may be, she knows not, but to a mere <HI>reader</HI> they are ever tire|some, and frequently disgusting; for which reason, as BELISARIUS was from its commencement intended for the closet, she has attempted, in their stead, to substitute concise narrative and plain sense.</P>
<P>It was her intention to have prefixed a list of the subscribers names to the piece, but as several people objected to having their's printed, it was thought un|necessary to publish only a part of them. However, she has with many thanks to acknowledge the encou|ragement she has met with.</P>

<L>'TIS not in man to cherish chaste content</L>
<L>In his tumultuous soul; discordant passions,</L>
<L>Now rising like the billows in a storm,</L>
<L>Carry him far beyond where reason reigns,</L>
<L>And <HI>now</HI> exhausted by the boisterous fray</L>
<L>Drop far below her sphere&mdash;</L>
<L>He who is <HI>poor</HI> longs for the chink of gold,</L>
<L>The unsocial pomp of stiff magnificence,</L>
<L>The jargon of a thousand senseless terms&mdash;</L>
<L>And thinks that <HI>greatness</HI> is exempt from woe;</L>
<L>Nor knows that dainties pall upon the taste,</L>
<L>And pleasures made too common lose their relish.</L>
<L>Pleasures! can <HI>grandeur</HI> boast of pleasures then!</L>
<L>Ah no&mdash;'tis but another word for <HI>care:</HI></L>

<L>The precious <HI>gale,</HI> that through the lattice blows</L>
<L>On the tir'd body of some sleeping slave,</L>

From dreams of <HI>mutiny,</HI> and <HI>schemes,</HI> and <HI>murder,</HI></L>
<L>I start, and think some bold conspirator</L>

<L>I stalk around my chamber a sad prey</L>
<L>To torturous reflection&mdash;my broken rest</L>

<L>You look, my friend, as though some mighty woe</L>

<L>Does look upon you, your aspect so dismay'd</L>
<L>Straightway discomforts him.&mdash;</L>
<L>Tell me, <HI>Tiberias,</HI> what is it grieves you?</L>

<L>Entic'd, stray'd on some youthful object fair,</L>
<L>Who, heedless of your sighs and soft confessions,</L>
<L>Your midnight watchings, and uneasy days,</L>

<L>Yes, the last day that Felix held his feast,</L>
<L>Where the young nobles were conven'd for sport,</L>
<L>Ere well the <HI>viands</HI> were remov'd, and we</L>
<L>Began to fill our goblets, one arriv'd,</L>
<L>Whose wrinkled forehead bald, and homely garb,</L>
<L>Pronounc'd him old and poor&mdash;with port erect,</L>
<L>Nor bent by age, nor humbled by distress,</L>
<L>He enter'd the pavilion, led by a child,</L>
<L>And ask'd from us a shelter for the night:</L>
<L>Which being granted, on a little stool</L>
<L>The boy plac'd the old man, for he was blind.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quite inattentive to his aged presence</L>
<L>We spoke without reserve each busy thought:</L>
<L>And as the bowl went round, our warming hearts</L>
<L>P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nted with deeds of fame&mdash;we talk'd of <HI>war,</HI></L>
<L>The fate of kingdoms and of laws corrupt&mdash;</L>

<L>Each one had sway'd the empire of the world.</L>

<L>He check'd the rudeness of our speech unguarded,</L>
<L>And in the most pathetic language wail'd</L>
<L>Sad <HI>Rome's</HI> undone condition;</L>
<L>Reproach'd the selfishness of crafty men</L>
<L>Who rul'd the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and sold for gold</L>
<L>The favours due to merit.</L>
<L>Experienc'd wisdom floated from his lips;</L>
<L>And a deep silence testified our wonder;</L>
<L>Till a bold youth, whose eyes did swim with wine,</L>
<L>Rose sudden from his seat, and stammering said,</L>
