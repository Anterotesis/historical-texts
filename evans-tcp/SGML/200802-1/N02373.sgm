</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_CIVIL Government is the Life of Publick Society; a Con&s;titution of Government formed to the ju&s;t Liberties, and be&s;t Intere&s;ts of human Nature, in Civil &amp; Religious Affairs; and animated by a wi&s;e &amp; ju&s;t Admini&s;tration is the Strength of that Life: And the Agency of Sovereign Divine Grace, in giving it to his Own People, &s;preads an incomparable Glory upon the whole; and makes a mo&s;t powerful Motive of &s;olemn Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The latter part of this <HI>P&s;alm</HI> opens to us, with a Divine Eloquence, the Glory &amp; Maje&s;ty of the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in that Series of Wonders; <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s Redemption out of <HI>Egypt:</HI> Ver&s;e 15th, <HI>Thou ha&s;t with thine Arm redeemed thy People&mdash;:</HI> And con|cludes with the Excellency of their Government, and Leaders, <HI>Thou ledde&s;t thy People,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

In the Words ob&s;erve the following things,</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> was <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s Leader: <HI>Thou ledde&s;t thy People</HI> Their Civil Con&s;titution (as well as Eccle&s;ia&s;tical) was Extraordinary: There was a more immediate Interpo&s;ition of GOD him&s;elf; in their Laws &amp; Admini&s;tration: there|fore u&s;ually denominated a <HI>Theocra&s;y.</HI> GOD by Him&s;elf broke the Iron Yoke; Formed their Go|vernment for them, Executed &amp; Admini&s;tred it when Formed.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Manner</HI> of the Admini&s;tration: <HI>Thy People, as a Flock. GOD the Shepherd; I&s;rael</HI> his <HI>Flock:</HI> This carrys an happy mixture of Tenderne&s;s &amp; Authority; Power &amp; Care; Pro|tection &amp; Di&s;cipline: Acted by the neare&s;t Re|lations, &s;pecial Propriety, and deare&s;t Affection.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>illu&s;trious In&s;truments</HI> u&s;ed by Him; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron.</HI> Tho' their Government was a <HI>Theocra&s;y:</HI> it did not exclude In&s;truments: But then the In&s;truments fir&s;t employed in this &s;ingu|lar Government were agreable to it: Extraordi|nary and very Excellent Ones: Extraordinarily Called, Furni&s;hed A&s;&s;i&s;ted &amp; Supported by GOD. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron</HI> were the Two fir&s;t In&s;truments u&s;ed by GOD: the renowned Heads of the Two Orders, Civil &amp; Religious. GOD rai&s;ed them, furni&s;hed them, ve&s;ted them with Power; and by his &s;pecial, con&s;tant Pre&s;ence with them, made them both, but <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> more remarkably, the mo&s;t &s;ignal Ble&s;&s;ings to their People, and Examples to all future Rulers.</P>
<P>How properly &s;oever my Text would lead to it&punc; as one &s;pecial Branch of GOD's Government, to con&s;ider <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s Con&s;titution, and Rulers in

Church, as well as State, I pa&s;s it; and &s;hall be govern'd by the occa&s;ion; and confine my &s;elf to the Civil Con&s;titution &amp; Rulers, as a fruit of GOD's merciful Government, and give you a few tho'ts upon the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>that,</HI> when wi&s;ely and ju&s;tly managed. I will give you my Subject in the following</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>IT is to be Notic'd &amp; Celebrated, as an high Favour of GOD to his People; when He leads them like a Flock, by the hand of</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>and</HI> Aaron; <HI>or Wi&s;e &amp; Good Civil Rulers.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the principal Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, and a People's mo&s;t vital &amp; fundamental Di&s;tinction, Honour &amp; Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in their Excellent Con&s;titution of church-Government formed upon the revealed Plan, the holy Scriptures; and wi&s;e &amp; faithful Guides to admini&s;ter it: Churches formed by CHRIST him&s;elf, with an exact agreablene&s;s to his own mo&s;t wi&s;e &amp; perfect Rules, filled with Ordinances, and all In&s;tituted Officers; and very particularly a learned and faithful Minini&s;try: The&s;e are a People's Glory and Safety, (<HI>P&s;al</HI> 147 20.) what they &s;hould e&s;pecially value, be thankful for, be concern'd to &s;ecure &amp; improve. But the Occa&s;ion leads me to the Civil; and that too is a very illu&s;trious Fa|vour of GOD. I will give you my thot's upon the important Things contained in this General Propo&s;ition; under the following Heads.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002816_0007_0FE64F815EE5E980">

<ITEM>PROP. <HI>IV.</HI> This is to be acknowledged &amp; ce|lebrated as an <HI>high Favour.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>PROP. <HI>I. GOD is, in an appropriate manner, the</HI> Leader <HI>of a Profe&s;&s;ing People.</HI> He was <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s Leader; and he is the leader of every profe&s;&s;ing People. Every profe&s;&s;ing People is his peculiar People; and he leads them as &s;uch. Indeed they are not led by the &s;ame extraordinary, miracu|lous, immediate hand of GOD, that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was in their Redemption from <HI>Egypt,</HI> Conduct thro' the Wilderne&s;s, and their being put into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canaan.</HI> This is Celebrated, &amp; Confined to to them: Deut. 4. 32, 33, 34. <HI>Ask now of the Days, that are pa&s;t, from the Day that God created Man upon the earth</HI>&mdash;<HI>Did ever People hear God &s;peaking out of the mid&s;t of Fire? Or hath God e&s;&s;ayed to take him a nation out of the mid&s;t of a na|tion, by temptations, by &s;igns, by wonders, and by a mighty hand,</HI> &amp;c. But yet in every other pro|fe&s;&s;ing People, there's the &s;ame Relation of GOD to them, as to <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> the &s;ame Grounds &amp; Princi|ples of Acting towards &amp; for them: and they ex|pre&s;s them&s;elves in the &s;ame happy Fruits; tho' working after a diver&s;e manner, <HI>viz.</HI> By <HI>&s;econd</HI> Cau&s;es. But here I will give you my tho'ts un|der two Heads, di&s;tinctly. (1) GOD is the &s;u|preme, ab&s;olute Lord of all Creatures. (2.) In
<PB N="5" REF="002816_0008_0FE64FB2AC63D4A0">
a peculiar manner, he is the <HI>Leader</HI> of a profe&s;|&s;&s;ing People.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD</HI> is the &s;upreme, ab&s;olute Lord of <HI>all Creatures.</HI> He is the univer&s;al <HI>Fir&s;t Cau&s;e;</HI> infi|nitely &amp; ab&s;olutely Perfect; and therefore mu&s;t have an unlimited, unalienable, perpetual and univer&s;al Dominion over all Creatures; particu|larly over all his rea&s;onable Creatures; Per&s;onal|ly, or Relatively: Singly, or in Society. <HI>No Authority</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly be, but from GOD. <HI>All Power</HI> is limited by his mo&s;t perfect Will, duely notified. <HI>No Power</HI> can be again&s;t him. The&s;e are all Truths mo&s;t evident to Rea&s;on; and their Contraries draw after them the mo&s;t ab&s;urd Con|&s;equences; nay flat Contradictions. And the Scriptures clearly exhibit them as &s;uch to us, Dan. 4. 24. <HI>Till thou knowe&s;t that the mo&s;t high ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom&s;o|ever he will.</HI> P&s;al. 145. 13. <HI>Thy kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom; and thy dominion thro' out all generations.</HI> P&s;al. 135. 5. <HI>I know, that the Lord is great above all gods; what&s;oever the Lord plea|&s;ed; that did he, in heaven, earth, &s;eas,</HI> &amp;c. The univer&s;al Influence &amp; Agency of GOD, here af|firmed, includes a <HI>Moral,</HI> as well as a Natural or Phy&s;ical Power; <HI>Right,</HI> as well as <HI>Strength.</HI> Once more, That celebrated, but very much vexed and abu&s;ed Text is very clear &amp; full Proof Rom. 13. 1.&mdash;<HI>No power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> 'Tis not po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be any, but what flows from this only Fountain of Being &amp; Power: And it's equally im|po&s;&s;ible for GOD to deny him&s;elf, and give any Creature a Power again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002816_0009_0FE64F839DEAB8D0">
But I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD is in a peculiar manner the <HI>Leader</HI> of his <HI>Own People.</HI> Here I will mention to you, &s;ome of the <HI>Di&s;tinctions</HI> &amp; <HI>Characters</HI> of this pe|culiar Government.</P>
<P N="1">1. It's founded in &s;pecial <HI>Relations,</HI> and pecu|liar <HI>Works</HI> of GOD. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> became his Subjects, and he their Leader; by new, near &amp; endearing Relations &amp; peculiar di&s;plays of his Wi&s;dom, Pow|er &amp; &s;overeign Bounty. And thus it is in a Degree with re&s;pect to every profe&s;&s;ing People.</P>
<P>They are formed, redeemed, &s;eparated to GOD, by &s;pecial di&s;plays of Divine Perfections: New and very near Relations between GOD &amp; them ari&s;e from the&s;e &s;pecial Operations. His Provi|dence works very gloriou&s;ly &amp; di&s;tingui&s;hingly, in preparing them for the honourable &amp; happy Station: He &s;o becomes their Father; and they his Children, in an uncommon manner. They his Servants, and he their Lord, by a new &amp; mo&s;t endearing Claim: Deut. 32. 6. <HI>Do ye thus requite The Lord; O fooli&s;h people &amp; unwi&s;e? Is he not thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee, &amp; e&s;tabli&s;hed thee?</HI> My narrow bounds won't allow me to go into the delightful particu|lars.</P>
<P>But again, His Conde&s;centions are very won|derful, in his mo&s;t free &amp; gracious binding him|&s;elf to them, by Word, Oath&punc; mo&s;t &s;ignificant Covenant Rites &amp; Seals, which contain the mo&s;t precious Good, made over to them upon the be&s;t Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ms. And they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deliberately bound them|&s;elves to a con&s;tant, faithful Compliance with the&s;e Terms. I&s;a. 43. 21. <HI>This People have I</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002816_0010_0FE64FB528C6F700"><HI>formed for my &s;elf.</HI> Deut. 26. 17, 18. <HI>Thou ha&s;t avouched the Lord to be thy God, and he hath avouched thee to be his People.</HI> This Covenant is the &s;pecial, formal ground &amp; rea&s;on of the &s;pe|cial Relation, and that peculiar Government here treated of. And this is di&s;cour&s;ed of, &amp; de&s;cribed under the Metaphor of the martial Authority and Marriage Union; which is the clo&s;e&s;t of any we know of among Men, between Two Per&s;ons. Jer. 2.2. <HI>Go, and cry in the ears of Jeru&s;alem, &s;aying, I remember thee the kindne&s;s of thy youth; the love of thine E&s;pou&s;als.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He leads &s;uch a People, by a <HI>&s;pecial Pro|vidence,</HI> regulated by the <HI>Covenant</HI> between GOD and them: In that they Promi&s;e to him an uni|ver&s;al willing Obedience, according to his own revealed Will; and he binds him&s;elf, to be&s;tow upon them, in that way, all the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant. He makes over him&s;elf, and all his Stores &amp; Riches; and they are as &s;ure of them, as if actually Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. 2 Cor. 6. 16, 18. <HI>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my People: and I will be a father unto you, and you &s;hall be my &s;ons and daughters, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> But he threatens the contrary Evils, if they are fal&s;e to him. <HI>Deut.</HI> 23. <HI>thro' out.</HI> Now GOD's Providence, in all it's &s;miles &amp; frowns, is regulated by this Covenant: He di&s;pen&s;eth to them, agreably to his Promi&s;es and Threatnings; with due Re&s;erves for the ex|erci&s;e of his Patience, Sovereignty &amp; Grace; which Re&s;erves are fully provided for in this Co|venant.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="002816_0011_0FE64F83CD645070">
3. He feeds them by his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Ordi|nances.</HI> It was <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s peculiar Privilege, as GOD's People, That GOD committed his Ora|cles to them; gave them his Statutes, Judgments and Ordinances, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 147. 19, 20. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 2.</P>
<P>And this Di&s;tinction &amp; Privilege de&s;cends to every profe&s;&s;ing People. The Word &amp; Ordinan|ces are the In&s;truments e&s;pecially wherein, and whereby GOD exhibits the Directions, Authority, Ble&s;&s;ings &amp; Advantages of that peculiar Relation and Government, which he hath taken upon him|&s;elf, towards them.</P>
<P N="4">4. He leads them by <HI>the Hand of a Mediator.</HI> The great Mediator between GOD &amp; Sinners, is the appointed, univer&s;al Lord over all things. Matth. 28. 18. <HI>All power is given unto me, in heaven, &amp; in earth.</HI> And it's a mo&s;t joyful and endearing Character of this univer&s;al Empire, that it's given, received &amp; exerci&s;ed in it's whole va&s;t Extent with a &s;pecial Eye to his Peoples univer&s;al, &amp; be&s;t Good, Eph.1.22. <HI>Put all things under him; and given him, to be head, over all things to the Church.</HI></P>
<P>But that which I am e&s;pecially concerned here, to ob&s;erve to you is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Redeemer is in a mo&s;t glorious &amp; delightful manner his Fa|ther's King in &amp; over his Church, P&s;al. 2. 6. <HI>Yet have I &s;et my king upon my holy hill of zion.</HI> All Government in &amp; over the Church, whether Providential, formally &amp; properly Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Spiritual, is <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Government: The Church is his Seed, Family, Spou&s;e, nay Body: And their whole Direction &amp; Di&s;po&s;e belongs to him. He is mo&s;t authentickly, effectively &amp; &s;o|lemnly
<PB N="9" REF="002816_0012_0FE64FB55C2E2068">
ve&s;ted in it; P&s;al. 2. 7. <HI>Thou art my &s;on, this Day have I begotten thee.</HI> GOD is in the mid&s;t of his Church, and his Re&s;t there will be eternal &amp; glorious: But he exerci&s;eth this Sove|reignty by that mo&s;t excellent &amp; lovely Dele|gate his own only Son, his own Image &amp; Bright|ne&s;s, (and by his own free Con&s;ent) our Surety. This mo&s;t wonderful &amp; glorious Per&s;on, a&s;&s;umed our Nature; and in this Nature Travelled &amp; Dy|ed in our &s;tead, and for our highe&s;t Good: And in this Nature, with all it's e&s;&s;ential Affections, he Reigns in &amp; over his Church. He, or the Father by him, manageth the Kingdom of Providence and Grace to them. And how many delightful things doth this Contemplation &s;ugge&s;t to us: Mo&s;t certainly, This Admini&s;trator makes it a peculiar Government, and exhibits it &s;uch. GOD hath peculiar De&s;igns with regard to them: A peculiar Trea&s;ure in them. He hath put them into the wi&s;e&s;t &amp; kinde&s;t hand, to Protect, Order, and to make them Happy; mo&s;t &s;afely to &s;ecure his Trea&s;ure, and exactly &amp; fully reach his de|&s;igns.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you &s;ome Tho'ts on the <HI>Fir&s;t Propo&s;ition,</HI> and proceed to the <HI>Second.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. <HI>II.</HI> GOD leads his People <HI>like a Flock.</HI> This Propo&s;ition is but a farther Pro&s;ecution of the foregoing; a going into a particular di&s;play of the excellent Characters &amp; Glories of God's ap|propriate Government. Here I &s;hall not oblige my &s;elf to the Metaphor, with any critical Solli|citude; only keep the general Idea, conveyed by it in &s;ight, as I pa&s;s along.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002816_0013_0FE64F8B4F400998">
This of a <HI>Shepherd,</HI> is an Allu&s;ion which anci|ent Writers, Sacred &amp; Common, have very much delighted in: They have &s;et it in the mo&s;t beautiful &amp; advantageous Lights, to repre&s;ent a well-regulated, wi&s;e &amp; happy Government by; and to give the be&s;t In&s;tructions to the Conduct of Rulers. 'Tis a very lively &amp; natural Emblem; and we find the &s;upreme Ruler him&s;elf u&s;ing it, to give us the ju&s;t &amp; honourable Ideas of his own Government.</P>
<P>In general, I have already ob&s;erved to you, That the Metaphor of a <HI>Shepherd</HI> carrys an happy mixture of Tenderne&s;s &amp; Authority, Power &amp; Care, Protection &amp; Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>GODs &s;pecial Government includes all the&s;e, we are &s;ure it mu&s;t. We &s;ee all the&s;e things in the brighte&s;t light, when we con&s;ider &amp; contem|plate it, in what we have already heard of it un|der the Fir&s;t <HI>Propo&s;ition, viz.</HI> It's &s;pecial Founda|tions; &s;ublime Rules; peculiar Providences; and mo&s;t glorious Admini&s;trator: Where the&s;e meet, there mu&s;t be Tenderne&s;s &amp; Authority, Power &amp; Care, Protection &amp; Di&s;cipline, mo&s;t Perfect and Divine: There mu&s;t be all the Qualities &amp; Af|fections of a <HI>Shepherd</HI> exerci&s;ed in Perfection, in all the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, Offices &amp; Work of a <HI>Shep|herd.</HI></P>
<P>And if we add to this, An Enquiry into Fact; as upon infallible Scripture Record, we &s;hall find GOD exerci&s;ing this Tenderne&s;s &amp; Authority all along, in his Dealings with his People.</P>
<P>Here it may be proper to go a little into par|ticulars.</P>

Here I will ob&s;erve the following Order; (1.) Offer &s;ome general <HI>Explanation</HI> or <HI>Illu&s;tration.</HI> (2.) An Hint in <HI>Proof</HI> very briefly. (3.) Con|clude it with the <HI>Character</HI> of a good Ruler.</P>
<P N="1">1 I will offer &s;ome general <HI>Explanation.</HI> When&s;oever a People enjoy an excellent Form of Government &amp; good Rulers, it's GOD's Gift. His Power &amp; Favour are very remarkable in it. The Agency of the Sovereign GOD in this Af|fair, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>Extraordinary</HI> and <HI>Ordinary.</HI> GOD gives as really &amp; truly, when a Peo|ple are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, in the <HI>Ordi|nary</HI> Methods of Providence, as in the <HI>Extraordinary.</HI></P>
<P>When the Under&s;tandings of a People are enlightned and directed to Contrive &s;uch a Scheme of Government, as be&s;t an&s;wers all the great Ends of Society &amp; Government: And with|al there's &s;uch a Concurrence of Circum&s;tances and Inclinations, as to bring it in, &amp; e&s;tabli&s;h it; GOD is as truely the Author of that Scheme &amp; Form, as if declared by a voice from Heaven, and received &amp; e&s;tabli&s;hed by the mo&s;t miracu|lous Operations &amp; Appearances.</P>
<P>Again, When in the Ordinary ways of Educa|tion, Experience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Men are qualified for, &s;pirited to, and introduced into the proper Stati|ons &amp; Opportunities to employ them for the pub|lick Good; it is as really GOD's Work as if they were In&s;pired, and called out extraordinarily, by Name, to the honourable Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Once more, When the De&s;igns of &s;ubtle &amp; powerful Tyrants again&s;t a People's ju&s;t Liber|ties are da&s;hed, and their valuable Rights are pre&s;erved or re&s;tored, it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s GOD's glorious Work

and precious Gifts when done by Ordinary, as well as Extraordinary Methods.</P>
<P>In the&s;e mentioned In&s;tances, there's GOD's &s;tamp: they are e&s;tabli&s;hed by his Approbation and Authority, as well as bro't to pa&s;s by his Pro|vidence; not only the Agency of the fir&s;t uni|ver&s;al Cau&s;e, but the Authority of the &s;upreme Lord &amp; Lawgiver. The renowned <HI>David</HI> is an In&s;tance of both the Ordinary &amp; Extraordinary manner of Introduction. GOD furni&s;hed and &s;pirited him to Government, by Extraordinary &amp; Immediate Impre&s;&s;ions; but withal he formed him to it, by bringing him into the King's Ser|vice; and accu&s;toming him to War, &amp; publick Bu&s;ine&s;s. GOD appointed him King by an <HI>im|mediate</HI> De&s;ignation; but yet the Tribes Cho&s;e him. This is the Excellent Man of whom GOD &s;ays, P&s;al. 78. 71, 72. <HI>He cho&s;e David,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>He bro't Jacob to feed his people.</HI></P>

Were it at all needful here, I could for Proof draw to|gether very many In&s;tances, from the mo&s;t un|que&s;tionable Records, Sacred &amp; Common. Par|ticularly, It would be ea&s;y to fill up the Proof from the holy Scriptures; and mention to you

If you En|quire, You I find this one Remarkable in <HI>Mo&s;es'</HI>s Character: There's no que&s;tion to be made of it, but he had large mea&s;ures of Prudence, by &s;pecial Impre&s;&s;ions from above. But be&s;ides this, we find him trained to Government, by his Adopti|on &amp; Education, by <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s Daughter; and his intimate Acquaintance with the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Learn|ing.

<PB N="18" REF="002816_0021_0FE64F964F9889D8">
The wi&s;e Conduct of &s;uch a People required an uncommon Meekne&s;s &amp; Patience. Again, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was to lead them thro Wants &amp; Difficulties, and innumerable Hazards.

<P N="3">3.

<P>All that I will &s;ay by way of <HI>Application</HI> &s;hall be in Two Articles, (1.) A Call to <HI>Thanks|giving.</HI> (2.) A word of Advice to the <HI>Rulers</HI> &amp; <HI>People of New-England.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;ee hence, what abundant rea&s;on of <HI>Thankfulne&s;s</HI> We, and the Nations we derive from, have unto GOD. His Favour to them, and us, is very great; and &s;hould be acknow|leged with mo&s;t humble, &s;incere, &s;olemn &amp; prac|tical Returns to him.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Our <HI>Nations</HI> have abundant rea&s;on to be very Thankful to GOD, and <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> in and with them, for GOD's uncommon Favours to them; in

the mentioned In&s;tances particularly. We &s;ee them, by a Series of Wonders, in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion;</HI> of a mo&s;t happy Ci|vil Con&s;titution, formed with great Wi&s;dom, to the ju&s;t Liberties &amp; be&s;t Intere&s;ts of Society; an happy Settlement of the Succe&s;&s;ion in the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Line, and Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of HA|NOVER: The Con&s;titution animated by a KING renowned thro' <HI>Europe,</HI> for his Wi&s;|dom, Ju&s;tice, Courage, Paternal Di&s;po&s;ition to his People, and all Royal Virtues &amp; Qualities; very glorious in a Circle of his own illu&s;trious I&s;&s;ue; giving a long, delightful Pro&s;pect to the Nations. This excellent KING, hath been remarkably continued to us, by GOD's wonder|ful Care. May the &s;ame Divine Care be exten|ded to him &amp; his, for a long cour&s;e of Years! Once more, We &s;ee them flouri&s;h under a ju&s;t liberty of Con&s;cience to <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters.</HI> The&s;e among many others, are the weightie&s;t motives of Prai&s;e to us as well as them.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) We in <HI>New-England</HI> have abundant Rea&s;on of Prai&s;e. By a train of uncommon Providen|ces, we enjoy a pure Religion &amp; Ordinances; ma|ny &s;ignal Civil Privileges; good Rulers, &s;eeking our Welfare: The&s;e, with innumerable other Smiles of GOD, are very delightful Rea&s;ons of Prai&s;e; and we &s;hall be inexcu&s;ably Ungrateful, if we don't &s;uitably Prai&s;e GOD for them; Prize and Improve them to his Glory.</P>
<P>And here, As an Expre&s;&s;ion of our Thankful|ne&s;s to GOD, We take leave to Addre&s;s Your HONOUR our Commander in Chief, in a very particular manner; and the re&s;t of our

Honourable Fathers in the Government; with the publick Profe&s;&s;ion of our dutiful &amp; grateful Sen&s;e of the Wi&s;dom, Care &amp; Faithfulne&s;s of your Admini&s;tration. We Ble&s;s GOD for that gracious Pre&s;ence, that hath &s;o remarkably a&s;|&s;i&s;ted &amp; &s;ucceeded your Endeavours for the Pub|lick; and do, &amp; &s;hall con&s;tantly Pray, That he would continue &amp; enlarge it to you; make you more &amp; more Ble&s;&s;ings; &amp; encrea&s;e upon Us, (your Charge,) abundantly the Motives of Joy &amp; Prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2 I Conclude with a &s;olemn word of Advice to all whom my Di&s;cour&s;e e&s;pecially Concerns; (1.) To tho&s;e concerned in the <HI>Choices of this Day.</HI> (2.) To tho&s;e ve&s;ted with <HI>Publick Tru&s;ts,</HI> of one kind or another. (3.) To the <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To tho&s;e in whom the <HI>Elections of the Day</HI> are ve&s;ted: The Di&s;cour&s;e gives Direction to your Choice. It mu&s;t not be Prejudice, &amp; Party, &amp; private corrupt Affection, that determines you; but a &s;incere regard to the known worth &amp; fitne&s;s of the Per&s;ons Cho&s;en. They mu&s;t be &s;uch as you may rea&s;onably hope, GOD will be pre&s;ent with, and work by. GOD and your Country have put a put a great Tru&s;t upon you; expect your wi&s;e and faithful Management of it, and you mu&s;t give an Account to GOD.</P>
<P N="2">(2) To you who are put into <HI>Publick Tru&s;ts.</HI> The Exhortation from GOD (your Supreme) is, Endea|vour to be, &amp; manage in your &s;everal Tru&s;ts, as GOD would have, &amp; directs by the &s;hining Pat|tern now exhibited. The Charge committed to you is very weighty: Every publick Care is &s;o; but of GOD's peculiar People his Trea&s;ure, e&s;pecially. GOD expects it, that as Fathers, you be tender of
<PB N="27" REF="002816_0030_0FE642CBCADB4818">
their <HI>Religion,</HI> their <HI>Morals,</HI> their <HI>Privileges,</HI> their <HI>univer&s;al Good.</HI> He demands it, as a leading Arti|cle, That the Rulers of <HI>New-England</HI> take a &s;ingu|lar, tender Care, of the Pure, Scriptural Religion of <HI>New-England,</HI> that excellent, pure Doctrine, Wor&s;hip &amp; Di&s;cipline, which GOD hath planted here, and which our Fathers purcha&s;ed this Land for; (and by infinite Labors, Hazards &amp; Expences too;) that they might enjoy it them&s;elves, &amp; tran&s;|mit, as an invaluable Trea&s;ure to their Children. This will make you the delight of the pre&s;ent, &amp; the prai&s;e of future Generations; and which is in|finitely better, will &s;ecure the &s;miles of GOD. Again, That the Rulers, according to their Advan|tages for it, &s;mile upon Learning &amp; the Mini&s;try: The&s;e are very vitally linked with Religion. Re|ligion will &s;oon decay without Learning; &amp; even dye without a learned &amp; faithful Mini&s;try; &s;o that <HI>our All</HI> very much turns upon an effectual wi&s;e Care to &s;ee them well &s;upported.</P>
<P>GOD expects that you lead his &amp; your People, by a bright Example, in his ways. And particu|larly, That you exemplify the beauty &amp; advan|tage of a wi&s;e Union among your &s;elves, upon the be&s;t Principles. That you exhibit with the bright|e&s;t Evidence, your generous, publick Spirit &amp; Prin|ciples. That you unite with your &s;piritual Guides and godly People, in mo&s;t fervent Supplications, That you may like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Samuel,</HI> &s;tand in the Breach; &amp; be Princes with GOD. In a word, That you become the happy Promoters of their <HI>leading peaceable &amp; quiet lives, in all godline&s;s &amp; hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I Conclude, to the <HI>People&punc;</HI> It's of infinite Importance, that you come in with <HI>your</HI> Part:
<PB N="28" REF="002816_0031_0FE64F9F51B1ADA8">
That your Tempers &amp; Carriages be agreable. The publick Good can't be attained without you. The Wi&s;dom &amp; Care of Rulers will be in vain, without your compliance with their Endeavours.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Pray earne&s;tly for them.</HI> Their Cares are great, their Qualifications high; the Con&s;e|quence of their Actions reacheth great Numbers, and in their very weighty Intere&s;ts; their Temp|tations are very many. They entirely depend on GOD, (with the meane&s;t &amp; weake&s;t of their People,) for all they want. Never forget them in Secret, Private or Publick. Be&s;iege Heaven for them, by effectual, fervent Prayers con&s;tantly; That they may be Ble&s;&s;ed, &amp; made Ble&s;&s;ings, very &s;ignal ones: That they may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, &s;ucceeded, rewarded by infinite Grace in Chri&s;t. Join with them in <HI>Solo|mon's</HI> Prayer, 2 Chron. 1. 10. <HI>Give me now wi&s;dom &amp; knowledge; that I may come in, &amp; go out, before this thy People.</HI> Jam. 1. 5. <HI>If any man lack wi&s;dom, let him ask of God.</HI> 1 Tim. 2. 3. <HI>For Kings &amp; all in Authority.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Carry it &s;uitably to them.</HI> Love and Reverence them as Fathers; and let them &s;ee and feel that you do &s;o. Make the publick Cares ea&s;y and delightful to them, by an honourable Sup|port, a proper Submi&s;&s;ion to their ju&s;t Authority, and a chearful Union with them, in your Stations, for the Honour of GOD &amp; the publick Welfare.</P>
<P>Thus, if Superiors &amp; Subjects Unite, it will be for our un&s;peakable Advantage; and it may be &s;aid of us, as in P&s;al. 144. 15. <HI>Happy is the Peo|ple, that is in &s;uch a ca&s;e: yea, Happy is that Peo|ple, who&s;e God is the Lord.</HI></P>
