<HEAD>An E&s;&s;ay, concerning Silver and Paper Currency.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_PAPER Currency at a great Di&s;|count,</HI> has prevailed for &s;everal Years in many of our <HI>Colonies,</HI> and by Ad|vocates for it both in Conver&s;ation and Print, deluding the People with fal&s;e Appearances and Repre|&s;entations; it is likely to continue and multiply among&s;t us to greater Di&s;advantages than ever: As ap|pears by the late large labouring Emi&s;&s;ion of 90,000 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>Maryland,</HI> the enacted but not as yet current Emi&s;&s;ion of 48,300 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>New York,</HI> the printed Projection for 180 000 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>this Province,</HI> and by the Apprehen&s;ions we are under of a further <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Emi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In Affairs of this Nature, a true hi&s;torical Account of Facts and their Con&s;equences, is called <HI>political Experi|ence</HI>; and as Things are more naturally under&s;tood by their Eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts, than by their Principles: I &s;hall endeavour, by relating bare hi&s;torical Facts, concerning <HI>Currencies,</HI> with &s;ome &s;hort Remarks upon the &s;ame; to &s;et our <HI>Plantation Paper Currencies,</HI> more e&s;pecially with Regard to this Province, in a true Light.</P>

The Varieties of compu|tative or <HI>nummary Denominations</HI> of different Countries, are no Hindrance; they are reconciled or adju&s;ted by, what is called, the <HI>Par of Exchange.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Par of Exchange,</HI> is the intrin&s;ick Value (in Weight and Finene&s;s) of the <HI>Silver Coin</HI> or Denominations of one Country, reduced to the like Value of Denomina|tions of another Country. Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Table of the A&s;&s;ays, Weights, and &s;terling Values of foreign Coins, publi&s;hed by Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot,</HI> A 1727, is a proper Standard. From this no Country &s;werves, excepting by a &s;mall Variation, called, the <HI>Difference of Exchange.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Difference of Exchange,</HI> is a &s;mall <HI>Premium</HI> allowed for the Trouble and Ri&s;que of having Silver (that uni|ver&s;al Staple and Medium of Trade) remitted to an&s;wer the <HI>Ballance of Trade</HI>; according as the Imports and Ex|ports of Countries in other Goods, do exceed one the other. The printed <HI>Prices current</HI> of &s;everal trading Towns, from Time to Time informs us of this.</P>
<P>Originally the <HI>nummary Denomination of Silver,</HI> &s;eems to have been the &s;ame as its Weight or <HI>ponderal Deno|mination</HI> It would have been happy and <HI>facile</HI> for the World, if it had &s;o continued; but from the <HI>corrupt civil Admini&s;trations</HI> (not from the Ballance of Trade) from Time to Time, in all Countries, the Value of the Num|mary from that of the ponderal Denomination has been altered, <HI>to Defraud Creditors,</HI> and more e&s;pecially to cheat the Creditors of the publick.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> for many Ages before the 14th <HI>Century,</HI> the <HI>nummary Pound</HI> was the &s;ame with the Pound weight of Silver (this was in a proper Sen&s;e the <HI>natural Pound</HI>) that is a computative <HI>Pound</HI> Sterling was 12 <HI>Oz</HI> of Silver, a <HI>Mark,</HI> or 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s 8 <HI>Oz</HI> of Silver. <HI>Iniquitous Ad|mini&s;trations</HI> &s;ince the Beginning of the 14<HI>th</HI> Century, have from Time to Time, reduced the nummary Deno|minations to a le&s;s Value than its Weight, and cheated Creditors of &s;ome Part of their ju&s;t Dues and Demands: For the Space of about 250 Years the Weight of Silver in the &s;everal nummary Denominations, has at Times, been le&s;&s;ened (that is the nummary Denominations de|preciated) excepting in the Minority of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. when the <HI>Denomination call'd a Shilling</HI> ro&s;e from 142 <HI>Gr</HI> to 176 <HI>Gr.</HI> of fine Silver; but during the Confu&s;ions occa&s;i|oned by the hot Di&s;putes, between the Families of <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rk</HI>

and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> it fell again to 142 <HI>Gr</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it continued un|til the arbitrary Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, it fell more and more, and <HI>A</HI> 1546 it was only 40 <HI>Gr; A</HI> 1551 by the bad Admini&s;tration of the <HI>Duke of Somer&s;et</HI> Lord Pro|tector in the Minority of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. it was reduced to 20 <HI>Gr.</HI> but immediately after the <HI>Duke of Somer&s;et's</HI> be|ing beheaded, it ro&s;e to 88 <HI>Gr.</HI> and remained &s;o, until <HI>A.</HI> 1601 it &s;uffered a &s;mall Reduction to 86 <HI>Gr.</HI> where it continues to this Day. Thus <HI>our pre&s;ent nummary Pound</HI> contains only about 4 <HI>Oz. of Silver,</HI> that is only one Third of what it originally contained.</P>
<P>In all other Nations the like has been done in bad Admini&s;trations. The <HI>Dutch Pond Ulams</HI> (6 Guilders) which originally contained 12 <HI>Oz Silver,</HI> at pre&s;ent is 2 <HI>Oz Silver.</HI> The <HI>French Livre</HI> originally was a Pound or 12 <HI>Oz.

<P>The&s;e almo&s;t incredible Depravations of the &s;everal <HI>nummary Denominations,</HI> had not the lea&s;t Relation to the <HI>Ballance of Trade,</HI> and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them happened in Times prior to their &s;everal Nations being much concerned in Trade; excepting what happened in <HI>France</HI> in the End of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and Beginning of <HI>Lewis</HI> XV. Reigns; <HI>Silver from a Mark or</HI> 8 Oz <HI>at</HI> 27 Livres <HI>was at length</HI> A. 1719 <HI>impo&s;ed upon the People at</HI> 120 <HI>Livres:</HI> The Iniquity of the Admini&s;tration, not the Ballance of Trade was the Cau&s;e.

<P>In <HI>Europe</HI> all Nations have had the Ballance of Trade &s;ometimes in their Favour, &s;ometimes again&s;t them; and each of them more or le&s;s at different Times; foreign Wars, civil Wars, Lo&s;s of Trade, Increa&s;e in Trade; without altering the Value of their <HI>nummary Denomina|tions</HI> in Re&s;pect of &s;tandard Silver.</P>

<P>In the <HI>Briti&s;h Plantations</HI> originally an <HI>Engli&s;h Crown</HI> was 5 <HI>s.</HI> Denomination; in Proce&s;s of Time, they re|mitted to their Creditors at Home a <HI>Piece of Eight,</HI> which is only 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> Sterling, at the Rate of 5 <HI>s.</HI>; &s;ome Time after that in mo&s;t of our Colonies this <HI>Piece of Eight</HI> was paid away to their Creditors at 6 <HI>s.</HI> and would have gone further, by <HI>Per&s;ons in Debt</HI> getting into the Admini&s;tra|tion or Power of defrauding their Creditors; if the Mer|chants at Home had not procured an Act of Parliament called the <HI>Plantation Act,</HI> whereby a <HI>Piece of Eight</HI> in all our Colonies was fixed at 6 <HI>s.</HI> for 6 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d., per Oz. Silver</HI>: In the&s;e Colonies, who upon this Act pa&s;&s;ed their Silver by Weight only as a Currency (<HI>Barbados, Ber|mudas,</HI> &amp;c.) it continues &s;o to this Day, being 33 <HI>per Cent. Exchange</HI>: But in &s;ome of the Colonies <HI>(Leeward We&s;t India I&s;lands, New York, New England)</HI> not u&s;ing Weight, they continue to carry on the Cheat by pa&s;&s;ing a light clipt Piece of Eight for 6 <HI>s.</HI> which is about 8 <HI>s. per Oz Silver</HI>; there being no Bounds to their Clipping, they were obliged to come into the U&s;e of Weights, but continued the Ounce of Silver at 8 <HI>s.</HI> Denomination, is 50 <HI>per Cent Exchange.</HI> In many of our Colonies they have gone greater Lengths, and by Floods of <HI>provincial Paper Credit</HI> or Money, they have made vile Work of it; <HI>&s;o that Exchange with Sterling is at pre&s;ent in</HI> Jer&s;ies <HI>and</HI> Pen&s;ilvania 60 <HI>or</HI> 70 per Cent. <HI>Advance</HI>; Maryland 100 <HI>per Cent.; the</HI> New England <HI>Colonies and</HI> Nova Scotia 400 <HI>per Cent</HI>: South Carolina, 700 <HI>per Cent; and</HI> North Caro|lina <HI>&s;till wor&s;e.

<P>I &s;hall, here give &s;ome <HI>In&s;tances of the bad Effects of Paper Currency made a legal Tender.</HI> The Arbitrary Go|vernment of <HI>France,</HI> after much Damage done to the Subjects in depreciating their nummary Denominations by <HI>recoinages</HI>; did <HI>A.</HI> 1719, to compleat their Mi&s;ery, em|brace Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s Project of a <HI>Paper Currency</HI>; Silver was bani&s;hed by &s;evere Penalties, Paper was made the only legal Tender. The Operation was; the Nation reduced to the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, Mr. <HI>Law</HI> and his Abettor Mr. <HI>D'Argen&s;on</HI> were di&s;graced; Silver again introduced as a Currency, and the only legal Tender.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>Gortz</HI> about 20 Years ago, had reduced <HI>Sweden</HI> to extreme Mi&s;ery, by impo&s;ing <HI>Government Notes</HI> in&s;tead of Specie. Upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Death, the <HI>Baron</HI> &s;uffered capital Puni&s;hment, this being one of the prin|cipal Crimes alledged again&s;t him. The Paper Currency was called in; the Silver and Copper Currency was re|&s;tored, upon the &s;ame footing as before <HI>Charles</HI> XII. Ac|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We have a very good In&s;tance in one of our own <HI>Co|lonies. Barbados A.</HI> 1702 emitted 16,000 <HI>l. Bills</HI> of Credit on <HI>Funds,</HI> to be brought in again by a <HI>Tax of</HI> 3 s. 9 d. <HI>on Negroes:</HI> At fir&s;t they pa&s;&s;ed at a Di&s;count, but no more being then emitted, and the Time of the coming in being at Hand, they ro&s;e again to near Par. Encouraged by this, they made a large Emi&s;&s;ion of 30,000 <HI>l. Bills on Land security</HI> at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> payable after 5 Years: The&s;e Bills immediately fell to 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> below Silver; but by an Order from Home they were all called in &s;oon, and their Currency became Silver Value as before. <HI>Ballance of Trade</HI> had not the lea&s;t Concern here.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004238_0007_10042a641dddb4c8"><HI>A Paper Credit</HI> well founded and under good Regu|lations, and not larger than what the Silver Specie Cur|rency will bear; has been found to be a very good Ex|pedient in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and it leaves the <HI>Silver Species</HI> at more Liberty to be u&s;ed as Merchandize, and for petty Occa&s;i|ons. In <HI>Holland</HI> all large Tran&s;actions are in <HI>Bank Transfers of Am&s;terdam,</HI> their Credit being better than that of the Government, and their Bank Money 3 a 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than the common Currency. The U&s;e and Credit of the <HI>Bank Notes in England</HI> we all know, their Fund being a valuable Depo&s;itum, a Call upon Oc|ca&s;ion on the Proprietors, and about <HI>Ten Millions</HI> Sterling in the Government's Hands; yet their Notes are no le|gal Tender. <HI>If Paper Credit exceeds a certain Proportion of the concomitant Silver Currency, its Effects are bad, and ruinous</HI>; by its precarious Lo&s;s of Value. The <HI>Bank of Venice</HI> was originally two Millions of <HI>Ducats</HI> given in, and Bills to a limited Sum given out, upon the Security of the &s;ame: This Scheme was &s;o good that their Bank Money became 28 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than common Curren|cy: from this good Succe&s;s the Government allowed them to i&s;&s;ue out more Bills, only to the Value of 300,000 <HI>Ducats</HI>; this &s;mall Addition brought down their Bills to 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Advance. <HI>N. B.</HI> By continued Additions they might have brought them down to Par, and from thence to a Di&s;count, even &s;o low as 400 <HI>per Cent,</HI> as is our Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Our Province Bills from the various Operations of fre|quent large Emi&s;&s;ions, di&s;tant Periods, and Periods po&s;tpon'd; are become</HI> 400 per Cent. <HI>wor&s;e than Sterling, and above</HI> 200 per Cent. <HI>wor&s;e than them&s;elves</HI> 25 <HI>Years ago.</HI></P>
<P>All well regulated Corporations are re&s;tricted, to i&s;&s;ue Bills or Notes not exceeding a certain Value: Thus it is with <HI>Engli&s;h Bank Notes, Ea&s;t-India and South Sea Com|panies Bonds</HI>; le&s;t by too large Emi&s;&s;ions, they might de|preciate their Notes and Bonds, to the Damage of the So+ciety it&s;elf, and Creditors. The <HI>King</HI> by an In&s;truction to his <HI>Governour</HI> of this Province, limits us to 30,000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> (to be under&s;tood Proclamation Money or its Value) for extraordinary Charges of Government.</P>
<P>The principal De&s;ign of a Currency or <HI>Medium</HI> of Trade, is to avoid the Inconveniencies of <HI>Barter:</HI> Paper Currency in large Quantities does not an&s;wer this End; becau&s;e of its Fluctuation, or rather progre&s;&s;ive le&s;s Value; which obliges the Merchant at length to return to <HI>Bar|ter</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="004238_0008_10042a6d690deef8">
again, as being &s;afe and better. In <HI>South Carolina,</HI> the Quantity of Paper Currency has &s;o depreciated it&s;elf, that all con&s;iderable Contracts, are made, not in Pro|vince Bills, but in their Produce <HI>Rice.</HI> In <HI>North Caro|lina</HI> their Produce, they call <HI>Specie,</HI> is 50 to 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than their Paper Currency.</P>
<P><HI>Silver</HI> is a &s;taple Merchandize, an adequate Pledge, and an univer&s;al commercial <HI>Medium.</HI> Our <HI>Province Bills</HI> have no intrin&s;ick Value, and as a Depo&s;itum, are no better than wa&s;te Paper; they are no exportable Mer|chandize, and receivable no where but in <HI>New England,</HI> being only an ill contrived provincial or <HI>municipal Medi|um. Barter</HI> is Merchandize (not &s;o &s;taple, and more bulky and peri&s;hing than Silver) exportable, and upon that Account preferable to Province Bills as a <HI>Medium.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Virginia, Tobacco</HI> is their <HI>Medium,</HI> and an&s;wers bet|ter than Paper, becau&s;e it is an exportable &s;taple Merchandize. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that at any Time it &s;hould become (as are our Bills) not exportable, and that Laws &s;hould be made there from Time to Time, for planting of greater Quantities, to increa&s;e their Medium; it would become in Cour&s;e &s;uch a <HI>Drug,</HI> that more and more of it would be given, for a certain Quantity of Silver or any other Goods, and at length be of no Value; but if their Government being &s;en&s;ible of their Error, &s;hould forbid planting above &s;uch a Quantity, their <HI>Me|dium</HI> would become good as before.</P>
<P>As to the Quantity of Paper Currency which the Sil|ver Currency will bear, without depreciating its Deno|minations; it is only to be learnt by Experience. In <HI>New England</HI> we found that <HI>A.</HI> 1713 there were 194,000<HI>l.</HI> in Province Bills at <HI>Par</HI> with Silver at 8 <HI>s. per Oz.</HI> When we began to exceed that Sum, our Paper began to loo&s;e of its Value: Here we ought to have &s;topt and kept within that Sum in our future Emi&s;&s;ions. <HI>New York</HI> never exceed 40,000 <HI>l.</HI> in Province Bills (at pre&s;ent only about 37,000 <HI>l.</HI>) and &s;o kept up their Value at 8 <HI>s. per Oz. Silver.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The larger</HI> the Paper Currency of any Country, <HI>the more it labours,</HI> and is circulated to the greater Di&s;advantage. The greate&s;t Quantity of <HI>Exchequer Bills in England</HI> (never were made a legal Tender but in Taxes) at one Time extant was <HI>A.</HI> 1716, being a 4,596,184 <HI>l.</HI> Debt, much of it contracted in the bad Admini&s;trations of the latter End of Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s Reign; Notwith&s;tanding of their

being above one Fourth of the Nation's Currency their being receivable in <HI>Taxes</HI> and all Trea&s;ury Affairs, and bearing Intere&s;t 3 <HI>per Cent. per Annum</HI>; they began to depreciate, and the Government was obliged to allow the <HI>Bank</HI> an Annuity to cancel <HI>Two Millions</HI> Sterling Value of them, and 3 <HI>per Cent. Premium</HI> to circulate, and &s;pecify the Remainder while above One Million, and afterwards only 1 <HI>per Cent. Premium. Anno</HI> 1702 there were extant <HI>Two Millions Sterling Value in Exchequer Notes,</HI> the Government allows the Bank 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> to circulate them while above One Million, and 1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> when not exceeding One Million. Since that Time, if <HI>Exchequer Notes</HI> are at any Time u&s;ed towards defraying the Charges of Government, they are hone&s;tly paid off next Se&s;&s;ions of <HI>Parliament.</HI> The la&s;t Emi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ex+chequer Notes</HI> was <HI>A</HI> 1730, being 510,000 <HI>l.</HI> towards the Charges of that Year, and were paid off <HI>A.</HI> 1731, the Year following.</P>
<P>If <HI>Paper Credit upon future Taxes or upon Loan,</HI> would an&s;wer as a <HI>Medium</HI>; how is it that the Govern|ments in <HI>Europe,</HI> find it &s;o intricate an Affair to rai&s;e Mo|ney for publick Charges in Time of War,or other extra|ordinary Occa&s;ions? When attempted by arbitrary Go|vernments, they always tend to the Ruin of the Subject: The State Bills of <HI>France</HI> in King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. la&s;t War, were &s;old at 50 or 60 <HI>per Cent. Di&s;count.</HI> Baron <HI>Gorz</HI>'s State Bills in <HI>Sweden</HI> were Part of the Crimes for which he &s;uffered Death.</P>
<P>Upon any extraordinary Emergency or Charge incur'd by the Government (we were by the King's In&s;tructi|on allowed to emit, not exceeding 30,000 <HI>l. Proclamati|on Value per Ann.</HI>) it may be proper to &s;atisfie it, by publick Bills of Credit, to be received again next Year in <HI>Taxes.</HI> This is only good Oeconomy, to lay Part of the extraordinary Charge of a preceeding Year, upon the Taxes of the Year following; they will be as good as Silver Ca&s;h, or better, if the Circulation is encouraged by a 5 <HI>per Cent. Premium</HI> or advance Allowance in the Trea&s;ury. By this good Management of cancelling the Bills in a Year or two, we kept up their Credit till <HI>A</HI> 1713.</P>

for the&s;e Extravagancies, he thereby &s;tarves his Trade, and di&s;appoints his Merchants and other Creditors: We are not to judge by Appearances only; <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> never was more extravagant and gay than at pre&s;ent, but never were more in Debt, never more incapable and back|ward in paying Debts.

<P>He &s;ays, <HI>That Province Bills ought to be emitted from Time to Time, and po&s;tponed; until the Quantity exceeds the Demand.</HI> This is impracticable in the Nature of the Currency: By Experience we find, that the more Emi&s;|&s;ions from Time to Time, the Value of the&s;e Bills is the le&s;s, and con&s;equently the greater Quantity of them is re|quired

<P>What he calls <HI>Buying with our Bills Silver at a Mar|ket Price</HI>; is, in a mercantile Phra&s;e, di&s;counting our Bills at a Market Price, with Silver, which is the fixed univer&s;al commercial <HI>Medium</HI>; thus he endeavours to per|&s;wade us, that our Bills are of a fixed Value, and that Silver fluctuates; after this &s;ame Manner, as if aboard of a coa&s;ting Ve&s;&s;el under Sail or fluctuating, he &s;hould endeavour to per&s;wade Pa&s;&s;engers, that the <HI>Ship</HI> &s;tands &s;till, and the Land fluctuates or alters: He might per|haps from Appearances per&s;wade one who had not the right U&s;e of his Rea&s;on.

<P>Of the &s;ame Nature is his A&s;&s;ertion, That <HI>when Goods ri&s;e or fall in our Market, the Change mu&s;t be in our Goods, but not in Paper Credit.</HI> Whereas in Fact Goods and Produce in this Place, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> have nearly re|tain'd the &s;ame Price (or rather of late are cheaper) for many Years, with Regard to Silver the univer&s;al com|mercial Medium: That is, the &s;ame Quantity of Silver will buy the &s;ame Quantity of Cloth, Woollens and Lin|nens of any particular Sort, and build the &s;ame Tunnage of Ve&s;&s;els (when Silver was at 8 <HI>s. per Oz</HI> Ships from 200 to 300 Tun to the Builder, co&s;t about 4 <HI>l per Tun,</HI> and 10 <HI>s.</HI> for Extras as was the Cu&s;tom at that Time; at pre&s;ent 15 <HI>l. per Tun,</HI> Extras included.) <HI>Labour</HI> is rather cheaper, a Ship-Carpenter when Silver was 8 <HI>s.,</HI> had 5 <HI>s.</HI> a Day, or 5 8ths of an <HI>Oz</HI>; at pre&s;ent he has only 12 <HI>s.</HI> a Day, which is not Half an <HI>Oz.</HI> at 27 <HI>s. per Oz</HI></P>
<P>The Author is a Stranger to the Affairs of <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> He compares the continued great Falls of our Province Bills from 50 to 400 <HI>per Cent.</HI> (I &s;uppo&s;e he means the <HI>Bubles A</HI> 1720) to the Changes in the <HI>Stocks</HI> negotiated there, which is only a &s;mall Fluctuation, pro|ceeding not from Ballance of Trade, or Variations in nummary Denominations, or Addition of more Stock on the &s;ame Fund; but from &s;ome <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck jabbing</HI> little Arts or Tricks.

they promi&s;e Money only at a di&s;tant Time, and a &s;uppo&s;ed Intere&s;t of 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Whereas the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or or <HI>Bond-Holder</HI> may demand at Plea&s;ure (or be allowed in any of their Sales as ready Money) but the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dia Company</HI> cannot oblige the Bond-Holder to quit (have it di&s;charged) his Bond, but at half Years Notice. Hence it is, that they bear an Intere&s;t lower than the common Intere&s;t (3 or 3 and an Half <HI>per Cent.</HI>) and &s;ell for a <HI>Premium</HI>; becau&s;e they are as Ca&s;h bearing Intere&s;t, which Silver Ca&s;h does not.</P>
<P>'<HI>Paper Money not being emitted in Quantities, is the Rea&s;on why the natural Intere&s;t among&s;t us ri&s;es.</HI>' This unnatural <HI>Medium</HI> in Quantities, has a quite different Ope|ration; from that of the natural <HI>Medium</HI> Silver in Plenty, which effectually lowers the Intere&s;t of Money.

<P>'<HI>No Man can &s;ay, but that his Money will now bring him in, as much Intere&s;t as ever.</HI>' The Matter of Fact is, 100 <HI>l.</HI> in Province Bills 25 Years ago, brought in 15 <HI>Oz.</HI> of Silver <HI>per Ann.</HI>; the &s;ame 100<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>l,</HI> at pre&s;ent does not bring in 5 <HI>Oz,</HI> is 5 equal to 15, or 1 to 3.</P>
<P>His <HI>tacit Con&s;ent of the Multitude to the Schemes of Pa|per Money</HI>; is a weak Argument in its Favour.

<P>He alledges that <HI>long Credit (our great Grievance) is from the Scarcity of Paper Money.</HI> No. It is from too great Imports, encouraged by large Emi&s;&s;ions. The Mer|chant or Factor cannot di&s;po&s;e of &s;o much, at a rea&s;onable ready-money Price, and therefore, that their Goods may
<PB N="20" REF="004238_0021_10042aaf2c3d7080">

<P>I canot avoid, by way of Digre&s;&s;ion, to make &s;ome Re|marks on <HI>long Credit.</HI> It makes the Unthinking buy profu&s;ely. Whereas ready Money, or a &s;hort Credit, would not allow a Man to buy and &s;pend more, than his pre&s;ent Earning could afford, con&s;equently he would live frugally, and keep clear of Debt: Foreign Com|modities would not be imported in &s;uch Quantities, be|cau&s;e they could not be con&s;umed fa&s;ter than our Earn|ings (our Returns) would admit of; and would an&s;wer the Intention of <HI>&s;umptuary Laws,</HI> which our &s;tated De|pendance on a trading Mother Country cannot allow of. Ready Money or a &s;hort Credit, makes a quick Circula|tion; the quicker the Circulation, the le&s;s Quantity of a Currency or <HI>Medium</HI> is required to carry on any Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s. This would be an effectual Method, and equivalent to enlarging our Currency.</P>
<P>He alledges al&s;o, that <HI>Shop Notes (another great Grie|vance) were introduced from the Scarcity of Paper Curren|cy.</HI> This is ill judged. Becau&s;e the <HI>Merchant</HI> to pro|cure a greater Advantage upon his Goods, than if &s;old for Ca&s;h; contracted with the <HI>Shop-keeper,</HI> to take it out in his Way by <HI>Trade&s;men's Notes</HI>: The Shop-keeper by impo&s;ing upon the Trade&s;men and Labourers, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the&s;e Notes, found their Profit in it; this made the Shop keepers chu&s;e to buy, to be drawn out in Notes. The Factor al&s;o found his Advantage in it, by dazling his Employer with a large Account of Sales, &amp; by encrea&s;ing his Commi&s;&s;ions.

<P>He encourages the <HI>Rhode I&s;landers</HI> to more Emi&s;&s;ions of Bills, '<HI>And they will find their Account in it, if they go on to emit a &s;ufficient Quantity of Bills.</HI>' He advi&s;es this Province to follow their Example, <HI>in emitting a great Quantity before it be too late.</HI> He does not con&s;ider that if this Province were to emit a Quantity of Bills in pro|portion to what <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> have emitted, (<HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets Bay</HI> Colony being to that of <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> nearly as 6 is to 1) they would be &s;o depreciated by their Quan|tity, as not to an&s;wer the End of a Currency, and oblige us to a <HI>Truck Trade</HI>; as in <HI>North Carolina,</HI> where their Truck call'd Specie, pa&s;&s;es at a great Advance above their Province Bills; and in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> by rea&s;on of their large Emi&s;&s;ions, all con&s;iderable Contracts are made

in their Produce Rice, not in Bills. A Man of a landed E&s;tate per&s;wades &s;ome Merchants his Neighbours and and Friends to accept his Notes for Goods and other Nece&s;&s;aries payable after 10 or 20 Years, and to circulate them all that Time without any <HI>Premium</HI>: And this Man a trading with the&s;e Goods to his own private Profit. It is &s;carce credible that there could be &s;uch <HI>Infatuation</HI> on the one Side, and &s;uch <HI>bare fac'd Impo|&s;ition</HI> on the Other. This is the very Ca&s;e between this Province and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land.</HI> It is in vain to think, that we may follow their Example; it is impracticable &s;o to multiply Bills to our Advantage, unle&s;s we could per|&s;wade (it is <HI>Folly</HI> to imagine it) all our Continent Plan|tations, to circulate them; <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> bears no greater a Proportion to this Province, than this Province does to all our other Colonies upon this Continent.</P>
<P>He is an inexorable Enemy to Silver, for the following Rea&s;ons, as he &s;ays.</P>
<P><HI>Silver has been and may be greatly depreciated by the Exce&s;s of its Quantity.</HI> Silver is of &s;o univer&s;al Demand all over the World; that the continued Additions to it is like throwing of Water into the Ocean, making no &s;en&s;ible Alteration: But a continued Emi&s;&s;ion of any pe|culiar provincial Paper Money, above a certain Sum, is like continued Pourings of Liquor into a Cask, which is &s;oon full, runs over, and the Additions are lo&s;t. In Fact, the computative or <HI>nummary Denominations,</HI> in&s;tead of containing more Silver, as it might be imagined from its Exce&s;s, do contain con&s;iderably le&s;s, <HI>v. g</HI> in <HI>England</HI> in&s;tead of 12 <HI>Oz to a Pound Sterling,</HI> as it was when Sil|ver was &s;carce, it is at pre&s;ent only 4 <HI>Oz</HI> when Silver a|bounds: But, as we have already proved, this proceeds from none of the Qualities of Silver; it is meerly from the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of civil Admini&s;trations. The Silver Mines of <HI>Pot&s;io</HI> are &s;aid to have been fir&s;t di&s;covered <HI>A.</HI> 1545, the nummary Denominations, as to Quantity of Silver, varied much before that Time, and &s;ince <HI>Anno</HI> 1552 (prior to this our Import of Silver was incon&s;iderable) in <HI>England</HI> they have altered or varied only Two, in Eighty Eight.</P>
<P><HI>Bills are a Commodity, not as a Pledge given but as Value paid, and therefore preferable to Silver.</HI> Is it not more natural to &s;ay, Silver is as a certain Value paid, as a Pledge, and as Returns or Merchandize; therefore it is prefera|ble to publick Bills, which are only as a precarious Va|lue
<PB N="22" REF="004238_0023_10042abac479a910">
paid, but no Pledge, and no Returns or Merchan|dize.</P>
<P><HI>Bills are le&s;s bulky and more handy than Silver.</HI> Is a Shop-keeper's (who&s;e Notes are already at a great Di&s;|count) promi&s;ary Note of Hand, better than a Bag of Silver.</P>
<P><HI>Notes on a fixed real Fund, are wor&s;e than Notes that have no &s;uch Fund</HI>; becau&s;e the former cannot grow bet|ter beyond that fixed Standard: But the others being bad, may grow better <HI>in infinitum.</HI> This is ludicrous. I can an&s;wer only by a like Story: A certain <HI>Quack</HI> in the Cure of a &s;ick Per&s;on, being told that by his Ma|nagement, the Patient did grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e: So much the better, an&s;wered the Quack, becau&s;e when Things are come to the wor&s;t, then they will mend. The Truth of the Ca&s;e is, the fir&s;t can be no wor&s;e, than the ju&s;t Di&s;count for the Di&s;tance of the Time of Pay|ment; but the Others may grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, <HI>in infinitum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If we make Bills promi&s;ing Silver or any Thing of a cer|tain Value, it will occa&s;ion their being hoarded up.</HI> It will be &s;o, where there are al&s;o current Bills, promi&s;ing a precarious or no Value; becau&s;e &s;uch will be hoarded up by no Body, but be gladly parted with, even at a Di&s;count, and Di&s;count upon Di&s;count, until we di&s;count near the whole, that is until they are of no further Cur|rency or Value: Accordingly in this Province, we are now arrived to a <HI>Di&s;count of more than two Thirds</HI> of what the&s;e Bills were fir&s;t emitted for. That a Bill without Limitation of Value or Period, and continually growing wor&s;e, &s;hould be preferable to a Bill with the Advan|tage of Period, and Value certain, and yearly meliorating, as are Bills on a fixed Silver Bottom; is a <HI>&s;trange Para|dox.</HI> Some keep up the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Bills and pa&s;s away the <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Bills; are the <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Bills there|fore better than the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>? Among&s;t our pre|&s;ent publick Bills, what are tore and defac'd, or &s;u&s;pect|ted, are pa&s;&s;ed away fir&s;t; are they therefore a better Currency, than a good fair Bill?</P>
<P><HI>There ought to be no Silver Fund for Bills, becau&s;e it will ri&s;e the Price of Silver, to make good this Fund.</HI> That is, all our Banks in <HI>Europe</HI> are ill founded, both Pub|lick and Private; becau&s;e they are all upon a Silver Bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004238_0024_10042ac52bad36a0"><HI>To pay Contracts according to a fixed Weight of Silver; would have an unavoidable Tendency to rai&s;e the Price of it.</HI> It does not happen &s;o in <HI>Europe,</HI> where Silver is their only legal Tender. In <HI>New England,</HI> paying of Contracts in Province Bills, does not ri&s;e the Price of them.</P>
<P><HI>Our Bills are better than Silver, becau&s;e they are by our Acts of A&s;&s;embly a Tender, and con&s;equently mu&s;t pa&s;s: Silver pa&s;&s;es only by Con&s;ent, which may be withdrawn.</HI> That is, a forced provincial Tender, pa&s;&s;able no where el&s;e, is better than a natural, univer&s;al, and legal (<HI>Pro|clamation Act</HI>) Tender, from which no trading Con&s;ent ever was or will be withdrawn: And 27<HI>s.</HI> in Bills the pre&s;ent Value of One <HI>Ounce</HI> of Silver, is better than 27 <HI>s.</HI> which was the Value of Three <HI>Ounces and an Half</HI> Silver Twenty Five Years ago; or in plain Words, One is more than Three.</P>
<P>The following Clau&s;es in his Book I cannot under|&s;tand, <HI>viz. Province Bills may be fixed to an a&s;&s;igned In|tere&s;t, and &s;o be made a ju&s;t Mea&s;ure or Standard of the Va|lue of all Things bought or &s;old, which Silver cannot be. &mdash;When Silver falls the Government may &s;top it at any fixed Rate, and make that the Silver Pound or legal Tender. Why not al&s;o when Silver ri&s;es if it were practicable. &mdash;Lowering the Price of Silver in</HI> England, <HI>where the nummary Denomination continues of the &s;ame Weight in our Coin,</HI> it is a Contradiction in it&s;elf. &mdash; <HI>By Means of a Paper Currency, to introduce Silver to pa&s;s current.</HI></P>
<P>He concludes thus. That he might now &s;hew, how the Bills of the old Tenour, might be qualified, for the true Ends and U&s;es thereof; and the like of private Notes of the &s;ame Nature, but having exceeded the Bounds of a Letter, he mu&s;t forbear. <HI>Cui bono</HI> is the whole, &s;ince he concludes without entring upon the main and only Affair?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t <HI>political</HI> Affairs have &s;ome Re&s;emblance, to na|tural <HI>o&s;cillatory</HI> Motions, when got to their Extent on the one Side; they mu&s;t return gradually and in the &s;ame Path to the other Side. Large Emi&s;&s;ions of a bad Currency, long Credit, In&s;en&s;ibility of Di&s;credit, Idle|ne&s;s, Extravigance, and Intemprance, have carried us to the Extent of bad Circum&s;tances: We mu&s;t return by
