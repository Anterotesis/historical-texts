<BIBL>II CHRONICLES IX.8:</BIBL>
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to &s;et the on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God; becau&s;e thy God loved I&s;rael, to e&s;tabli&s;h them forever, therefore made be that king over them, to do judgment and ju&s;tice.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THESE words were &s;poken by the Queen of Sheba, of whom honourable mention is made by our Saviour, in that &s;he came from a far country to hear the wi&s;dom of Solomon; who, when &s;he had come and proved him with hard que&s;tions, declares, that although the report &s;he had heard of his wi&s;dom and grandeur did far exceed her belief; yet having heard his wi&s;dom, and &s;een the grandeur and magnificence of his kingdom and attendance, &s;he finds rea&s;on to acknowledge that the half was not told her. And upon a view and reflection on the&s;e things, &s;he, with wonder and admiration, breaks forth in the language recorded in my text: <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to &s;et thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God; becau&s;e thy God loved I&s;rael, to e&s;tabli&s;h them forever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and ju&s;tice</Q>.</P>
<P>THESE expre&s;&s;ions di&s;cover an excellent &s;pirit of di&s;cernment, wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding in this royal female. Although a heathen, yet &s;he acknowledgeth the true God, and expre&s;&s;eth her belief of his governing providence in the affairs of this world, and in di&s;po&s;ing of men to places of public tru&s;t, power and authority; and with devout acknowledgments a&s;cribes glory to him, &s;aying "Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy God," &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB REF="017236_0005_0FA0B924228ED128">THE dignified character of the civil ruler is here al&s;o exhibited in its proper light. They &s;it upon God's throne, and are ve&s;ted with their authority for the Lord their God. All power is of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Their authority is deri|ved from him, and is to be u&s;ed for him: they are his vicegerents, acting by delegated authority from him; for which cau&s;e they are &s;ome times &s;tiled Gods. Thus &s;he ob&s;erves to Solomon, that he was &s;eated upon God's throne,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Although there was a &s;pecial propriety in repre&s;enting the kings of I&s;rael as &s;eated upon God's throne in that I&s;rael was a Theocracy, yet I can &s;ee to impropriety in applying this to civil rulers in general; which I con|ceive is warranted by the apo&s;tle who has &s;aid, "the powers that be, are obtained of God."</NOTE> and was made king for the Lord his God.</P>
<P>WE may here al&s;o ob&s;erve the accurate penetration and judg|ment of this dignified female, in that &s;he not only traceth civil government from its true &s;ource, as it is derived from God; but al&s;o wi&s;ely ob&s;erves the great ends and purpo&s;es to be &s;erved by the exerci&s;e of that power which particular per&s;ons, by the allot|ments of divine providence, are ve&s;ted with; which is to do good by the exerci&s;e of their authority to tho&s;e over whom they govern. Men are ve&s;ted with civil power, not for their own &s;ake; but for the benefit of tho&s;e among whom they are to exerci&s;e their autho|rity. For thus &s;he ob&s;erves to Solomon, "that it was becau&s;e God loved I&s;rael, to e&s;tabli&s;h them forever, that he had made him king over I&s;rael, to do judgment and ju&s;tice." Tho&s;e two expre&s;&s;ions, "judgment and ju&s;tice," are expre&s;&s;ive of the whole exerci&s;e of civil government. Civil rulers are to do judgment, that they may di&s;countenance and re&s;train all manner of &s;in and wickedne&s;s, by inflicting a proper puni&s;hment upon offenders; and they are to do ju&s;tice by an equitable deci&s;ion of all contro|ver&s;ies which ari&s;e between a man and his neighbour.</P>
<P>THUS we have the remarks of a female upon the nature, ends and purpo&s;es of civil government: and what pity is it that any who value them&s;elves upon being called <HI>men,</HI> &s;hould come behind her in the knowledge of the&s;e things; or if ve&s;ted with any branch of authority, &s;hould &s;o fail in the exerci&s;e of it, as to fall under the reproof of an old woman!</P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e this Gentile queen was directed
<PB N="7" REF="017236_0006_0FA0B9248A2949B0">
by in&s;piration when &s;he uttered the&s;e words: it is &s;ufficient to give a divine &s;anction to my text, that it here &s;tands recorded by an in|&s;pired pen-man for our in&s;truction and admonition; wherein we not only find the dignity and duty of civil rulers pointed out; but al&s;o many motives briefly touched, to excite them to the prac|tice of it. Their duty is to do judgment and ju&s;tice. They mu&s;t do judgment by puni&s;hing the vicious, therein rendering them|selves a terror to evil-doers. As a man can have no right to hurt his neighbour; &s;o neither to hurt him&s;elf: whence it appears to belong to the civil magi&s;trate to puni&s;h per&s;onal as well as relative offences. And they mu&s;t al&s;o do ju&s;tice, by making equitable deci&s;ions between contending parties.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the power of legi&s;lation is not here &s;o directly &s;poken of; but yet, as doing judgment and ju&s;tice is the great and important &s;ervice which civil rulers are to perform for the community, therefore when they are acting in a legislative capacity, it mu&s;t be their &s;pecial care to enact &s;uch laws, that the executive authority may be rendered ble&s;&s;ings to a people by the due exerci&s;es of judgment and ju&s;tice upon all occa&s;ions. Indeed, the kings of I&s;rael &s;eem to have been ve&s;ted with little or nothing of that power which is of the legislative kind. God him&s;elf had framed their laws by the mini&s;try of Mo&s;es, not only for their edification as a religious &s;ociety, or vi&s;ible church; but al&s;o for their good government as a civil &s;tate. We have there given us an excellent and truly divine model of civil government, worthy to be imitated by all nations. There laws are but few; expre&s;&s;ed in few, but plain terms, ea&s;y to be under&s;tood. They are for the mo&s;t part, general rules of equity; and but few &s;pecial &s;tatutes for particular ca&s;es. Some few particular &s;tatutes in certain ca&s;es are given, which might &s;erve as a pattern for the in&s;truction of ex|ecutive authority, to direct them to the righteous application of the more general rules of government in all particular ca&s;es that might ari&s;e; which men of interity might ea&s;ily apply, &s;o as to execute good judgment, and true equity among a people. When legi&s;la|tive powers e&s;&s;ay to frame particular &s;tatutes that may be a rule for the executive authority in every ca&s;e that &s;hall ari&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary that their &s;tatutes &s;hould be very numerous; which not only makes it more difficult to find men &s;ufficiently acquainted with the law to put it in execution; but al&s;o, many times wicked,
<PB N="8" REF="017236_0007_0FA0B926251627E8">
de&s;igning and crafty men invent ways to &s;helter evil actions under the letter of the law; or to &s;creen them&s;elves from ju&s;tice, becau&s;e the judges are obliged to proceed according to the expre&s;s terms of particular &s;tatutes. Indeed, where civil ju&s;tice is to be admi|ni&s;tred not by particular &s;tatutes, but by the application of general rules of equity, much will depend upon the wi&s;dom and integrity of the judges; which would make it peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in the ap|pointment of executive authority to practi&s;e upon the advice of Jethro to Mo&s;es, "To provide out of all the people able men &s;uch as fear God, men of truth hating covetou&s;ne&s;s". Might we de|pend upon having men of this character for the administration of ju&s;tice, we might be &s;afe in our per&s;ons and properties without &s;uch a multiplicity of particular &s;tatutes. For a man of an hone&s;t heart will, for the mo&s;t part, readily &s;ee how to apply general rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s to particular ca&s;es, &s;o as to do judgment and ju&s;|tice, without being confined to the expre&s;s terms of particular &s;tatutes.</P>
<P>But whether the affairs of a people are to be admini&s;tered by the application of general rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s or particular &s;ta|tutes adapted to each &s;everal ca&s;e; yet it is of &s;ingular moment that civil rulers, in every capacity, &s;hould con&s;ider them&s;elves as being made rulers over a people for the Lord their God. The apo&s;tle Paul agrees with our text and &s;peaks of civil rulers as mi|ni&s;ters of God for good. Rom. XIII 4. They are God's mini&s;|ters, in that they are to &s;erve him, acting as it were in God's &s;tead, in doing both judgment and ju&s;tice. It is a manife&s;t inference from the divine perfections that &s;in &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed: and the&s;e perfections of the Deity ought to be patterned after by all &s;uch as are &s;tiled God's on earth, all &s;uch as bear rule among men; that it may be truly &s;aid, that they act as his &s;ervants, vicegerents, or repre&s;entatives, in doing judgment upon tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Every well regulated &s;tate will make laws to di&s;countenance and re&s;train vice and immorality of every kind. To be &s;ure this is the ca&s;e with this &s;tate. We have rea&s;on to rejoice that our wi&s;e and good rulers have from time to time, made good and whole&s;ome laws to re&s;train the vicious, to put wickedne&s;s to &s;hame, and prevent the contagion of evil example from leading others a&s;tray. And it is the peculiar province of tho&s;e who are authorized to put the laws in execution, to render them&s;elves ble&s;&s;ings, great and exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ings to the people in doing judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017236_0008_0FA0B926CFAFBF40">INDEED, &s;uch civil officers will meet with many trying ca&s;es, in their putting the good and whole&s;ome laws of the land into execution. If they are not men of virtue and integrity, the fear of offending on the one hand, or the hope of making friends on the other, to &s;erve their own private intere&s;t, or ambitious views, may prove powerful temptations to connive at breaches of law, or to warp the law a&s;ide from its true intention, and fru&s;trate the &s;alutary purpo&s;e for which it was made, either by executing &s;o &s;mall a puni&s;hment as not to render them&s;elves terrors to evil|doers; or allowing &s;ome room for criminals to make their e&s;cape from puni&s;hment. Or if we allow the judges to be men of real integrity and uprightne&s;s, yet the tender feelings of humanity, e&s;pecially in very criminal ca&s;es, may be great temptations to bear the &s;word in vain, not approving them&s;elves the mini&s;ters of God, the avengers to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. But if they are mini&s;ters of God, act by authority derived from him, are to pattern after his perfections, and be finally accountable to him for the manner in which they conduct in their office; they ought and mu&s;t execute the good and whol&s;ome laws of the land in do|ing judgment and ju&s;tice. It is true, that although &s;everal per|&s;ons may be found guilty of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame &s;tatute, yet there may be great difference in the aggravating circum&s;tances of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of different per&s;ons; which has given ri&s;e to that common proverb, "the &s;everity of the law is cruelty," which may &s;ometimes have too great an influence upon the tender feelings of the judge, inclining him to relax the puni&s;hment, to the detri|ment of the public, who&s;e peace and pro&s;perity often requires the faithful execution of judgment upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. But &s;uch is our happy civil con&s;titution, that our legi&s;lative authority always have a power to relax the penalty to particular per&s;ons, where the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, and the public good requires it; &s;o that the executive authority may, with &s;afety and righteou&s;ne&s;s, pro|ceed in the execution of the law, leaving all &s;uch relaxations of the puni&s;hment as any particular ca&s;e may require, to the proper board.</P>
<P>THE civil peace and pro&s;perity of a community require in the fir&s;t place, that good and whole&s;ome laws &s;hould be enacted, for the distribution of judgment and ju&s;tice; but if the laws, when made, exi&s;t only on paper and ink, what benefit can a people de|rive
<PB N="10" REF="017236_0009_0FA0B927987EFF00">
from them! The divine law is quick and powerful, and &s;harper than any two edged &s;word; and &s;urely, his mini&s;ters ought to make the laws which they execute, bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to his, in the&s;e re&s;pects; which if done, the benefits to &s;ociety cannot ea&s;ily be reckoned up: But if tho&s;e who&s;e office it is to put the laws in execution, in&s;tead of giving vigor and efficacy to them, do &s;uffer them to langui&s;h and die in their hands; it is not ea&s;y to count the evils which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow from it.</P>
<P>SUCH officers cloud and darken their own reputation. It is truly an honour put upon a man, to be ve&s;ted with any branch of civil authority; thereby an opportunity is put into his hands to do the more good in the world, to render him&s;elf a more exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ing, and merit the honorable e&s;teem and regard of mankind. But yet, if a man doth not honor his office, his office will never honor him. The higher a man is rai&s;ed in civil rank, the more contemptible will he be in the eye of mankind, if his conduct is not &s;uitable to his &s;tation, &s;o as to an&s;wer in &s;ome good mea&s;ure, the ju&s;t expectation of mankind from him, the &s;olemn ties of the oath of God under which he is laid, and the important purpo&s;es for which he was dignified. Men may pity, but mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who thus betray the tru&s;t which the public have repo&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>NOR does the mi&s;chief flop here; but the law it&s;elf becomes de|&s;pi&s;ed and contemned, when men find they may tran&s;gre&s;s without fear of puni&s;hment. And while &s;ome few laws are thus &s;uffered to be trodden under fear, it emboldens wicked and de&s;igning men to di&s;regard all law, to de&s;pi&s;e government, and trample upon the authority; it opens a wide door to anarchy, confu&s;ion and every evil work. And in this ca&s;e, tho'e become the greate&s;t &s;ufferers, who are mo&s;t worthy, and most de&s;erving of protection. Men of hone&s;tly and uprightne&s;s, who make con&s;cience of their ways, are hereby laid open to in&s;ult and oppre&s;&s;ion; while the wicked are &s;uffered to pro&s;per in their wickedne&s;s. For if the foundations be de&s;troyed, what can the righteous do.</P>
<P>AT &s;ome periods there is a much greater tendency to anarchy and licentiou&s;ne&s;s among a people, than at others; and never was there greater danger of the&s;e evils, in this land, &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;et|tlement of it, than now. While the&s;e American &s;tates were de|pendent on the Briti&s;h crown, &s;uch were the mea&s;ures of admini|&s;tration, adopted by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and by the King him&s;elf,
<PB N="11" REF="017236_0010_0FA0B92873B584B0">
that it became nece&s;&s;ary for us, in the defence of our ju&s;t rights and privileges, to ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition to their proceedings. And although many of tho&s;e mea&s;ures taken in the land, were very ju&s;|tifiable, in that ca&s;e; yet &s;ome of them were not without their bad tendency and effects upon &s;ome people's minds. The le&s;s judicious part of mankind, who are not &s;o di&s;cerning in the pro|per and nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures of civil government, have perhaps, been emboldened to find fault with, and oppo&s;e all government. And it is very obvious that one cour&s;e to be taken, to prevent or remedy evils of this kind, is not to relax the laws; but to carry the reins of government with a &s;teady hand; and that all the good and whole&s;ome laws of the land &s;hould be diligently and carefully executed in doing judgment and ju&s;tice among the people. Greater &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity in the execution of the laws, &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent times, to prevent the dangerous and growing evils with which we are threatned.</P>
<P>IT is the anxious apprehen&s;ion of many, that at pre&s;ent, we have more rea&s;on to fear mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;ing from that &s;pirit of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and that tendency to anarchy and confu&s;ion, which &s;eems to be working in the land, than we have from our open enemies. Therefore it concerns every one to guard against, and do what in us lies, to prevent &s;uch evils. But it e&s;pecially concerns civil rulers, who&s;e more immediate care it is to maintain peace and good order, to exert their authority in &s;upport of the law, which can be done only by their diligence and <HI>faithfulne&s;s</HI> in doing judgment and ju&s;tice among the people; protecting, &s;up|porting and encouraging the virtuous; and frowning upon and puni&s;hing the vicious. The virtue of patrioti&s;m, at &s;uch a day as this e&s;pecially, ought to meet with all countenance and re&s;pect; and on the other hand, the oppo&s;ite vice of treachery calls aloud for the pur&s;uit of vengeance. Our noble patriotic army, which under God, is our chief bulwark, and the support of every thing dear and valuable to us, ought by no means to be neglected; but &s;hould receive all po&s;&s;ible &s;upport and encouragement. So like|wi&s;e all &s;uch friends to the &s;tate, which act in le&s;&s;er circles, ought to meet with &s;upport and encouragement; while &s;uch as are ini|mical to our freedom and protection expo&s;e them&s;elves to our ju&s;t indignation. Such as are inimical and treacherous, have acted very different parts in the pre&s;ent day. Some have acted an open
<PB N="12" REF="017236_0011_0FA0B9290C061C18">
part, and have gone and joined the enemy; while others have cho&s;en &s;till to continue at home among us; who have been much more hurtful to us, and helpful to the enemy, than tho&s;e who have gone off, and openly joined them. They, many of them, maintain a &s;ecret correspondence with the enemy, give them intel|ligence, carry on a clande&s;tine trade with them; they lie as a dead weight, throwing every clog and hindrance in the way of all our movements and efforts for our own defence; to them it is princi|pally owing, that our paper currency has &s;uffered &s;uch a great and rapid depreciation; and our land &s;o exhau&s;ted of provi&s;ions to feed the enemy, as greatly to di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;courage our own army. Every argument therefore, which will ju&s;tify us in our oppo&s;ition to Great Britain, &s;trongly plead for our mo&s;t vigorous efforts to detect, and make examples of &s;uch &s;ecret enemies as endeavour to conceal them&s;elves among us. It cannot therefore &s;urely, be &s;up|po&s;ed, that a civil officer, of whatever rank, who&s;e duty it is to execute the law, should shew more lenity towards a tory, than to a friend of his country; or be, by any means, backward, or inti|midated from doing judgment and ju&s;tice in that ca&s;e, yea, or in any other, wherein the peace and good order of the &s;tate are inte|re&s;ted. Nor are there any weighty and powerful motives wanting, to quicken every one to diligence in the duties of his &s;tation. Our text &s;ugge&s;ts &s;everal con&s;iderations of great weight, to influ|ence tho&s;e who are cloathed with authority, to exert them&s;elves in their own &s;tations, to pre&s;erve and promote the peace, good order, and pro&s;perity of the people. As</P>
<P N="1">I. THE hand of God is acknowledged, in putting men into their &s;everal ranks and offices, in a civil &s;tate. Thus faith the Queen to Solomon, "Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy God, which delight|eth in thee, to &s;et thee on his throne." It is the Lord's doing, and his hand is to be acknowledged in it. "For promotion cometh not from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t; but God is the judge; he putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another." Whatever methods are u&s;ed in choo&s;ing men, and inve&s;ting them with authority, yet all is under the controul of the wi&s;e and all-governing providence of God. For "the lot is ca&s;t into the lap, but the whole di&s;po|&s;ing thereof is of the Lord." When therefore men are called into places of public tru&s;t and improvement, they are to remember,
<PB N="13" REF="017236_0012_0FA0B929D4E015F0">
that the finger of God is in it. Which con&s;ideration, if duly at|tended to, plainly &s;hows a &s;pecial obligation hence ari&s;ing, to quit them&s;elves with diligence and faithfulne&s;s, in their public tru&s;t. Nor are they to look upon the call of God in his providence, which has &s;eated them in places of public improvement, as im|po&s;ing a burthen, but as conferring a ble&s;&s;ing, for which, accord|ing to the example of the queen in our text, God's name is to be ble&s;&s;ed. For there is not only an honour thereby put upon a per&s;on, but al&s;o an advantage for more exten&s;ive good and u&s;eful|ne&s;s in our day and generation.</P>
<P N="2">II. CIVIL rulers are likewi&s;e to con&s;ider that their power is the power of God. Our text repre&s;ents them as &s;eated on God's throne; and put into office for the Lord their God. And the apo&s;tle Paul tells us, "There is no power but of God; the pow|ers that be, are ordained of God." Rom. xiii. 1. God him&s;elf is the &s;upreme Governor of the world. But it is his plea&s;ure not to perform the whole of government immediately him&s;elf, but to im|prove his &s;ervants, as his in&s;truments, in the exerci&s;e of &s;ome in|&s;tances of it. Thus the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the angels of light, as mini&s;tring &s;pirits, &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter unto them which &s;hall be heirs or &s;alvation. Heb. 1.14. That noble order of beings e&s;teem it an honour to be employed in public &s;ervices, even for the good of mankind who are &s;o far below them. And they are faithful, zealous and very active in it. For we are told that "he maketh his angels &s;pirits, and his mini&s;ters a flame of fire." And &s;hall not men, when thus honored and authori&s;ed of God, feel them|&s;elves animated to diligence and faithfulne&s;s? They are rulers un|der God, and are to act in God's &s;tead in doing judgment and ju&s;|tice in their &s;everal ranks and &s;tations. Hence it is that they are &s;tiled Gods. P&s;alm LXXXII 6. "I have &s;aid, ye are Gods, and all of you are children of the mo&s;t high." If then, civil rulers are put into office that they might exerci&s;e this branch of divine au|thority, and make use of God's power in doing judgment and ju&s;|tice among their fellow creatures; it &s;urely ought to animate and influence them to diligence and faithfulne&s;s in it. And is it not a kind of &s;acrilege to pervert this divine prerogative to bad pur|po&s;es? Or even not to improve it to the good ends for which it was conferred upon them?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="017236_0013_0FA0B92A9C9AA1C0">III. ARE civil rulers God's mini&s;ters? Are they not then, ac|countable to him for their conduct in that &s;tation? Although they are Gods, they &s;hall die like men. Death is the great leveller of mankind, which &s;wallows up all di&s;tinctions which have taken place in this life, puts both rulers and ruled upon an equal foot|ing in the grave, that they may &s;tand in an equal rank in the day of judgment. The great men of the earth will be treated with no more ceremony and re&s;pect in that day, by their judge, than the meane&s;t beggar on the dunghill; but every one mu&s;t give an ac|count of him&s;elf to God, for his improvement of the talents he has received. God's &s;ervants here in this life, receive their talents &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s; &s;ome receive ten, others one; and accord|ing to their receipts, mu&s;t their account be. All the &s;olemn &s;cenes therefore, of the day of judgment, and all the rewards and puni&s;hments of an incomprehen&s;ible eternity, &s;tand before every one, before rulers as well as ruled, as &s;o many motives to diligence and faithfulne&s;s in the duties of their &s;tation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. GOOD and faithful rulers are repre&s;ented as expre&s;&s;ions of the love of God to a people. It was becau&s;e God loved I&s;rael to e&s;tabli&s;h them forever, that he &s;at &s;uch a wi&s;e king over them to do judgment and ju&s;tice. Good rulers are a great ble&s;&s;ing, and the admini&s;tration of judgment and ju&s;tice will be of un&s;peakable advantage to a people. And when a people are favoured with &s;uch, they are to look upon it a token for good, an expre&s;&s;ion of divine love, and a rea&s;on to excite them to ble&s;s the Lord. The Queen of Sheba, in our text, though not intere&s;ted in the pro&s;pe|rity of I&s;rael, ble&s;&s;ed God under a view of it. To be a ble&s;&s;ing in the world, a ble&s;&s;ing in our place, day and generation is a very de|&s;irable thing. Therefore when Abraham was &s;ent abroad in the world, that he might be &s;upported and encouraged to duty under all trials and difficulties, God promi&s;ed to make him a ble&s;&s;ing. Gen. XII.2. Tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with civil authority are there|by put into a capacity to render them&s;elves ble&s;&s;ings, great and exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ings in the world: but then they are &s;o, only in ca&s;e of their due and faithful di&s;charge of their public tru&s;t. And &s;hall not this be attended to as an effectual argument, and prevail|ing motive to &s;tir up such to diligence and faithfulne&s;s? Can any one bear the thought of being held up to view, and placed in a
<PB N="15" REF="017236_0014_0FA0B92B80E92398">
con&s;picuous &s;tation in civil life, that he may appear as an in&s;tance of God's anger again&s;t a people, rather than as an expre&s;&s;ion of his love? And be indeed a cur&s;e rather than a ble&s;&s;ing? No, I would hope better things, though I thus &s;peak.</P>
<P N="5">V. IT is farther implied in our text, that &s;uch civil rulers as will do judgment and ju&s;tice, are peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;tate. It was becau&s;e God loved I&s;rael, to e&s;tabli&s;h them forever, that he gave them &s;uch a wi&s;e ruler as Solomon was.</P>
<P>THE &s;tability, &s;trength and firmne&s;s of a &s;tate very much de|pend upon the &s;kilfulne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s of its rulers. While good government is maintained, the State will flouri&s;h, and make a re&s;pectable figure in the world; but when civil rulers neglect their duty, &s;lacken the reigns of government, and are not careful to maintain righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity; the State becomes fickly and will &s;oon fall into decay. Hi&s;tory will furni&s;h us with many ex|amples of &s;tates that have flouri&s;hed in the world, while regularity, order and good government were maintained in them; but have af|terwards fallen into di&s;grace, and crumbled into nothing, through the corruption and perver&s;ion of government.</P>
<P>THESE American &s;tates are now in their infancy, and but ju&s;t ri&s;ing up, and making their appearance in the world; much &s;till remains to be done for their e&s;tabli&s;hment. To this end the war mu&s;t be vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted; the army be kept up, be &s;uitably provided for, encouraged and rewarded; and our enemies counter|acted in all their plots and &s;chemes. We have a very powerful enemy to oppo&s;e, aided and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by treacherous and &s;ecret ene|mies among our&s;elves; for who&s;e detection and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion the vigour of law and utmo&s;t vigilence and activity of our rulers, &s;eem peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary and important. Good government al&s;o mu&s;t be kept up among our&s;elves; which is the mo&s;t effectual method to obtain re&s;pect, credit and influence abroad. A well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed &s;tate will be a terror to a foreign enemy, and be always ready to make a defence again&s;t every attack. There can be no better &s;ecurity again&s;t the approach of an enemy, than to be in a well|prepared &s;tate for a defence. And one principal thing in which preparedne&s;s for making a defence con&s;i&s;ts, is to be in a &s;tate of peace, regularity and good order among our&s;elves; which never
<PB N="16" REF="017236_0015_0FA0B92C0C2C5D10">
can be the ca&s;e, without the due exerci&s;e of civil government, in the faithful admini&s;tration of judgment and ju&s;tice among a peo|ple. Whether we regard the internal &s;trength, peace and pro&s;pe|rity of the &s;tate, or its external honour, re&s;pect and influence; civil government mu&s;t be maintained, good and whole&s;ome laws mu&s;t be enacted, and life and vigor given them by &s;uch as are authori|&s;ed and betru&s;ted with the care of putting the laws in execution. The &s;afety of the whole &s;tate, and the good, the &s;afety and intere&s;t of each individual of which the &s;tate is compo&s;ed, loudly call for the&s;e things at the hand of civil rulers.</P>
<P N="6">VI. ARE civil rulers God's mini&s;ters? Then &s;urely, they may hope for his ble&s;&s;ing on them, and pre&s;ence with them, in the di&s;|charge of the duties of their &s;tation. Difficulties are to be expect|ed, and trying di&s;couragements mu&s;t be encountered and over|come; wherein we need to attend to every animating con&s;ideration; among which, this &s;urely mu&s;t be of great weight, that "God is with us." Civil rulers are cloathed with authority by God, they are &s;eated on his throne, and employed in his &s;ervice; and may therefore hope for his ble&s;&s;ing to crown their faithful endeavours in the duties of their &s;tation. The encouraging hopes of civil ru|lers in this ca&s;e are not only warranted from their being God's &s;ervants, but they are al&s;o much &s;upported by experience, and the manife&s;t tokens of the divine pre&s;ence, in &s;upporting the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and especially in the things which tend to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this, as well as of the other independent &s;tates of America. Time will not allow me to enumerate parti|cular in&s;tances; but the over-ruling hand of divine providence has been often &s;o con&s;picuous in the events of the pre&s;ent war, as to extort a confe&s;&s;ion, even from infidelity it&s;elf, that it is God that fighteth for us; which tokens of the divine pre&s;ence ought to have a very animating and quickening influence upon every rank and order in the civil &s;tate to exert them&s;elves for the e&s;tabli&s;hment, peace and pro&s;perity of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="7">VII. CIVIL rulers have powerful motives to diligence and faithfulne&s;s in the duties of their &s;tation, from the pro&s;pect of a divine reward. Are civil rulers God's &s;ervants? Then to him they mu&s;t look for their reward. No wonder, if in this life, they
<PB N="17" REF="017236_0016_0FA0B92CD7A28980">
meet with unkind returns from an ungrateful world; but their labour is with the Lord, and their reward with their God. If they are truly faithful, yet a little while, and they &s;hall receive that ble&s;&s;ed <HI>euge,</HI> Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE way for a people to be ble&s;&s;ed with good rulers, is to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in the love of God. It was becau&s;e God loved I&s;rael, that he &s;et a wi&s;e king over them. All our ble&s;&s;ings come from God, the father of lights, from whom de&s;cends every good and perfect gift. When a people corrupt them&s;elves, abu&s;e their privileges, and yield them&s;elves to their own lu&s;ts, to be led away by an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God; they forfeit his favours, provoke his anger, and pull down his judgments upon them&s;elves. God will then cur&s;e their ble&s;|&s;ings, take away his abu&s;ed favours, remove from them the hedge of his providence, and open the door for a variety of calamities to make inroads upon them. Nothing therefore can be of greater concern to us, both with re&s;pect to our temporal and eternal intere&s;ts, than to &s;ecure the favour and love of God. For we have the te&s;timony of the apo&s;tle, that "Godline&s;s is pro|fitable unto all things, having the promi&s;e of the life which now is, and of that which is to come." And the wi&s;e king of I&s;rael, &s;poken to in our text, al&s;o tells us, "That righteou&s;ne&s;s exalts a nation: but &s;in is a reproach to any people." God once gave I&s;rael a king in his anger, and took him away in his wrath. If therefore civil rulers do not prove ble&s;&s;ings to a people; although &s;uch rulers may be highly criminal in not an&s;wering the good purpo&s;es of their appointment, yet the people ought fir&s;t to look at home, and remember that it is &s;ome God provoking wicked|ne&s;s among them&s;elves, that is the rea&s;on why divine providence has not &s;miled upon them, and given them the ble&s;&s;ing of good rulers.</P>
<P N="2">II. WHEN a people are ble&s;&s;ed with good rulers, the hand of God is to be acknowledged in it, with prai&s;e and gratitude. Even this gentile queen in our text, ble&s;&s;ed God on account of his love
<PB N="18" REF="017236_0017_0FA0B92E58380708">
to I&s;rael, in &s;etting a wi&s;e king over them to do judgment and ju&s;tice. Good rulers are a great ble&s;&s;ing to a people, while they, with diligence and faithfulne&s;s, attend to the duties of their &s;tation, admini&s;tering judgment and ju&s;tice, in the execution of the good and whole&s;ome laws of the land. The benefits thence ari&s;ing are very great and de&s;irable; which ought to be acknowledged as coming from the &s;ame divine Benefactor, who is the bountiful given of all our enjoyments. To him therefore, a tribute of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving is due from a people thus &s;miled upon of hea|ven. This is a favour which carries its bonds of duty along with it; and the people are to expre&s;s their gratitude for it, not in words only, but in actions; by leading peaceable and quiet lives in all godliness and hone&s;tly, under this good and faithful admini&s;tration of civil government. It belongs to the people to give countenance to, and to &s;upport and encourage civil rulers in their admini&s;t|ration of government. This will render the ruler's duty the more ea&s;y to him, and the more efficacious and beneficial to others. Yea, this is what people are obliged to do, for con&s;cience toward God; and is one way in which they are to expre&s;s their prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to their divine Benefactor for the ble&s;&s;ings of good government.</P>
<P>THE public occa&s;ion of this day, calls upon me, in a particular manner, to addre&s;s the important thoughts contained in my text, to the General A&s;&s;embly of this State now convened. And fir&s;t to his Excellency our Governor:</P>
<P>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY:</P>
<P>OBEDIENCE to your Excellency's commands having called me into this de&s;k, upon this public occa&s;ion; give me leave, &s;ir, to congratulate you for the &s;ingular honour God has put upon you, in your early introduction into the chief &s;eat of authority in Connecticut, when it was a colony to the British crown; conti|nuing you in that &s;eat through the revolution, to this day; and improving you as a very important in&s;trument in his hand, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this free State. Although your vigorous efforts, and &s;pirited endeavours in the defence of our liberties and privileges, and for the effectual e&s;tabli&s;hment of this State, are &s;uch as merit the e&s;teem and thanks of the public; yet all &s;uch
<PB N="19" REF="017236_0018_0FA0B92F086C5B58">
among us as wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to the Briti&s;h arms, look on them with an evil eye; and will therefore, by all means in their power, &s;eek your removal. But promotion cometh not from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh: God is the judge, he putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another. So long as God has any further &s;ervices for you to perform, in this public &s;tation, your excellency &s;hall &s;it &s;ecure, in this chief &s;eat of government, and as we tru&s;t, will u&s;e your authority for the Lord your God, and for the good of the State over which you pre&s;ide.</P>
<P>LET me also addre&s;s my&s;elf to his honour, the DEPUTY GOVERN|OR, to the honourable members of COUNCIL, and the re&s;pectable REPRESENTATIVES of the people, in General Court a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOURS, AND WORTHY GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>IT is my duty to remind you, as directed in my text, that you are by the providence of God, &s;eated upon his throne, and put into office for the Lord your God. And we encourage our&s;elves to hope that it is becau&s;e he hath loved this State, to e&s;tabli&s;h it forever, that he has called you to your &s;everal public &s;tations, to do judgment and ju&s;tice. That you may be the happy in&s;truments of &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, and an expre&s;&s;ion of the love of God to this people, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary that good and whole&s;ome laws &s;hould be enacted, but al&s;o enforced by the executive authority of the State: life and &s;pirit, vigor and efficacy mu&s;t be given them among the people, by proper officers, who will exert them&s;elves, in carrying the law into execution. Such officers are not only to &s;erve the people at large, but they are more im|mediately the &s;ervants of this General A&s;&s;embly. You have the appointment of them; and therefore rea&s;on dictates, that to you they &s;hould be accountable for their conduct in their &s;tations.&mdash;If there are any who betray their tru&s;t, neglect the duties of their &s;tation, or act an unworthy part, &s;urely the people may ju&s;tly expect &s;ome remedy, from the A&s;&s;embly. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t effectual method to e&s;tabli&s;h this State, is to e&s;tabli&s;h the influence of law and rule in the minds of the people; which can only be done by giving life and &s;pirit to the law, by diligence and faithfulne&s;s in the execution of it. To hold the reins of
<PB N="20" REF="017236_0019_0FA0B92FC70DE880">
government with a &s;lack hand, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a day as this, when people are &s;o apt to break over all rule and order, will open a door to many evils which afterwards cannot ea&s;ily be re|moved. When men are called up to public view, and ranked in the &s;everal &s;tations of civil government, for maintaining order and regularity among a people, an opportunity is given them to become exten&s;ively u&s;eful; but whether they &s;hall be e&s;teemed as an expre&s;&s;ion of God's love to a people, or of his anger; whether they &s;hall be a ble&s;&s;ing, or a cur&s;e, mu&s;t be made appear by their conduct in their &s;tation.</P>
<P>THE people of Connecticut, when they were a government, and now &s;ince they have been an independent State, have had rea&s;on to ble&s;s God that he has placed &s;uch upon his throne of civil power, and made them rulers for the Lord their God, as have been happy in&s;truments of our civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, by their wi&s;dom, diligence and faithfulne&s;s in doing judgment and ju&s;tice. And we hope and pray &s;till to continue under the divine &s;miles in this re&s;pect; and that it will appear that God loves this people &s;till, and has it in view to e&s;tabli&s;h us more and more, by giving us &s;uch to fill the &s;everal &s;tations in the government, as will approve them&s;elves rich ble&s;&s;ings by diligence and faithfulne&s;s in their &s;everal departments.</P>
<P>As a con&s;iderable number of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are pre&s;ent in this A&s;&s;embly, I &s;hall now take the liberty to addre&s;s may di&s;cour&s;e to my brethren, in the &s;acred character.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI></P>
<P>MANIFEST it is, that it comes within our province, to u&s;e our endeavours to promote the admini&s;tration of judgment and ju&s;tice among the people of our charge. Indeed, to win &s;ouls to a &s;aving union with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, mu&s;t be the chief and great &s;cope of our labour: but then, it concerns us &s;o to acquit our&s;elves in the mini&s;try which we have received of the Lord, that we may be able to &s;ay, "We have not &s;hunned to declare the whole council of God." All the doctrines of the go&s;pel are to be laid open, that the people may be found in the faith; and the &s;cope and tendency of the&s;e truths, for the purpo&s;e of holy living, mu&s;t be urged upon their con&s;ciences. To preach morality, is as really preaching Chri&s;t, is when we preach articles of faith.&mdash;
<PB N="21" REF="017236_0020_0FA0B93088422E78">
And as it becomes a good &s;teward of the manifold grace of God, to deal out to every one, a portion in due &s;ea&s;on; &s;o there are certain times when we have &s;pecial calls in divine providence, to warn again&s;t particular &s;ins; and more e&s;pecially to urge the practice of &s;ome particular duties; which calls of divine provi|dence may be ea&s;ily known by all &s;uch as duly ob&s;erve the &s;igns of the times, and the common practice of the people. The great prevalence of iniquity in the pre&s;ent day, is obvious to all men, which is a loud call to us, to cry aloud, and &s;pare not, to lift up our voice like a trumpet, to &s;hew our people their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, their &s;ins. And although it belongs to civil officers to execute judgment on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; yet, it al&s;o belongs to us to warn the wicked, that they may turn from their wicked ways. It belongs to us, not only to bear te&s;timony again&s;t vicious practices; but al&s;o, to encourage our rulers in their vigorous endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s all vice and im|morality; and to inforce upon the people due &s;ubjection to order and good government; which plainly appears from that &s;pecial charge of the apo&s;tle Paul to Titus, in Tit. iii.8. "This is a faithful &s;aying, and the&s;e things I will that thou affirm con&s;tantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to main|tain good works: the&s;e things are good and profitable unto men."</P>
<P>LET me finally direct my di&s;cour&s;e to the people at large.</P>
<P>You &s;ee in the text, that civil rulers are &s;eated on God's throne; they are ve&s;ted with authority for the Lord their God; and the de&s;ign of God therein, is to &s;hew his love to a people by their exerci&s;e of this authority, in doing judgment and ju&s;tice.&mdash;It belongs therefore to every one, not only to be in &s;ubjection to government them&s;elves, but al&s;o to &s;upport and encourage civil rulers in the di&s;charge of their office. For &s;hall we acknowledge that the admini&s;tration of judgment and ju&s;tice is the great ble&s;|&s;ing which God means to confer upon a people by the mini&s;try of civil rulers, and yet not be careful our&s;elves to ab&s;tain from tho&s;e vices, and to practi&s;e tho&s;e virtues in which the great and good purpo&s;es of civil government are an&s;wered? Nor is it enough that we confine our own conduct within the rule of duty; but it belongs to every one to di&s;courage and di&s;countenance all
<PB N="22" REF="017236_0021_0FA0B9316B601C58">
vice and immorality in others, by being ready to bear te&s;timony again&s;t them that do evil; and giving countenance to good and faithful rulers in the di&s;charge of their tru&s;t, in the execution of the law.</P>
<P>To conclude. That we may be ble&s;&s;ed with good rulers, it is the duty of every one, to &s;hun tho&s;e land defiling and God provo|king abominations which pull down divine judgments upon a people; and earne&s;tly &s;eek to God, that he would &s;hew his love towards us, in placing &s;uch upon his throne among us, as &s;hall faithfully do judgment and ju&s;tice: To enforce this, I &s;hall con|clude with that apo&s;tolic injunction, 1 Tim. ii.1, 2. "I exhort therefore, that fir&s;t of all, &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for kings and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty."</P>
