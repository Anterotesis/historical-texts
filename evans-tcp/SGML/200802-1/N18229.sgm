<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, DELIVERED AT THE OPENING OF PORTSMOUTH ACADEMY.</HEAD>
<P>THE BENEVOLENT mind mu&s;t experience great plea&s;ure in beholding means taking, and new in&s;titutions forming in various places, to educate our youth, and particularly that valuable part of our &s;pecies, our young FEMALES. This &s;ubject has engaged the attention of &s;ome of our mo&s;t beloved citizens in the&s;e &s;tates. They have ju&s;tly con&s;i|dered it, as a very important &s;ource of national pro&s;perity. They wi&s;h &s;o to conduct it, as will be&s;t accommodate it, to the &s;tate of &s;ociety, man|ners and government in our country.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="023649_0003_0FC08D1F4793AE98">THE Principal of the Academy, now opened a|mong us, has called our attention, my friends and fellow citizens, to a de&s;ign which it is in our power to make profitable to him, as well as beneficial to our children. The healthine&s;s of our climate&mdash; the elegant manners of the people of this town, give us all nece&s;&s;ary advantages: It is by our uni|ted aid that it may flouri&s;h, even if no a&s;&s;i&s;tance is derived from others.</P>
<P>WHEN we reflect, that early education tinctures or forms our character in a great degree, for life; we are irre&s;i&s;tibly drawn to exert our utmo&s;t ability to afford our youth every po&s;&s;ible advantage to gain the be&s;t. That &s;mall &s;um which indu&s;try and eco|nomy will give almo&s;t every parent, is far better be&s;towed, than a large patrimony joined with ig|norance. A knowledge of bu&s;ine&s;s every day pre|&s;ents men with offices who&s;e rewards are equal to the rent of large e&s;tates, and the annual intere&s;t of great &s;ums&mdash;where the&s;e per&s;ons have not inherited a &s;hil|ling, and po&s;&s;e&s;s no other riches than a good edu|cation.</P>
<P>BY in&s;tructing our <HI>females</HI> in tho&s;e u&s;eful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary branches of indu&s;try which are peculiar to
<PB N="5" REF="023649_0004_0FC08D2162170918">
their &s;ex, we al&s;o furni&s;h them with a &s;ource of wealth and profit, which is nece&s;&s;ary for all conditions in life; which may be laid a&s;ide when affluence per|mits, or a&s;&s;umed when adver&s;ity with its billows rolls trouble and indigence upon them.</P>
<P>THE mode in de&s;cent of lands&mdash;the very equal di&s;tribution of property&mdash;and the equality of rank in our country al&s;o demand, that every cla&s;s of our citizens educate their children in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible. The great Creator of us all, has made no difference in the endowments of the head or heart, between the child of the monarch or of the pea&s;ant. Very rarely does the property of a frugal ance&s;tor de&s;cend to the third generation. The&s;e ideas daily convince us, that a good education, principles of virtue, and u&s;eful acquirements, are to be &s;ought as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential benefits for our children.</P>
<P>THIS theme has been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;o often, that I cannot in&s;ure to you, that I &s;hall &s;ay any thing new upon this occa&s;ion. The mo&s;t I can promi&s;e is to refre&s;h your memories, and keep alive the &s;ubject. As a Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter, I can come to you with no better arguments and examples, than tho&s;e pre|&s;ented in the volume of our holy religion. The
<PB N="6" REF="023649_0005_0FC08D226472C7B0">
Bible affords the mo&s;t excellent patterns, by which to form the great and u&s;eful character of men and women. In the 31&s;t chapter of Proverbs, we find a model for the female character, by which to make the daughter of every American citizen, that virtu|ous woman who&s;e price is far above rubies. Solo|mon clo&s;es this rich trea&s;ury of in&s;truction, with a chapter which records the le&s;&s;on of a mother to her &s;on, even the words of King Lemuel&mdash;the le&s;&s;on which his mother taught him. He was now per|haps in the improving &s;ea&s;on of youth, or ju&s;t ad|vanced to the throne, and &s;eeking a Queen. After &s;ome general in&s;tructions upon temperance and cha&s;tity, upon comforting and defending the afflict|ed, &s;he proceeds with portraying the character of a good wife The mother of a King is employed in an office highly becoming her rank. She is pre&s;ented by the wi&s;e King Solomon, as a pattern to mothers in general. It is their peculiar ta&s;k to direct the morals of youth. Their care in infancy, con&s;tant attention and &s;ociety during the critical period of youth&mdash;the many opportunities which do|me&s;tic life affords, enable them alone, to do the duty properly. Bu&s;ine&s;s and many cares call the father abroad, but home is the mother's province; here &s;he reigns &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s, the greate&s;t part of her
<PB N="7" REF="023649_0006_0FC08D2BA84D2768">
life. If her children err, &s;he mu&s;t bear a large &s;hare in their guilt and &s;ufferings This chapter is more valuable when we con&s;ider, that in a good wife are united the characters of a daughter, mother, friend and mi&s;tre&s;s; mo&s;t of the deare&s;t relations in life are concentred in her. Is &s;he &s;uch a per&s;on as fills all the&s;e &s;tations properly? Behold her rewarding the cares, and cheering the &s;ouls of her affection|ate parents, obedient children, tender hu&s;band, firm friends and faithful &s;ervants. The&s;e live, as by her &s;miles. Is &s;he u&s;eful in her &s;tation? Does &s;he excell? A long train of the good and virtuous attend her wi&s;hes, applaud her conduct, and exalt her prai&s;e. Dome&s;tic happine&s;s dwells where &s;he re&s;ides; &s;ociety is adorned and made plea&s;ant by her actions; religion is recommended by her bright example. She appears like one of tho&s;e guardian angels, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to attend around the good in this world, as mini&s;tring &s;ervants, to guide, guard and animate them through life, and convoy them after death to Heaven.</P>
<P>WHILE fine writers, poets and painters, gene|rally &s;elect good women to repre&s;ent angels; they al&s;o take the bad, to portray the horrid picture of furies. While we greedily gaze at the one, we
<PB N="8" REF="023649_0007_0FC08D2CAF6B1D48">
turn with abhorrence from the other. So odious is the &s;ight of the bad, that even vicious men, &s;hun their company and avoid their acquaintance, in the pre&s;ence of the oppo&s;ite lovely character, whom the poet de&s;cribes in the mother of our race &mdash;"grace was in all her &s;teps&mdash;Heaven in her eye &mdash;in every ge&s;ture, dignity and love."</P>
<P>"THE price of a virtuous woman is far above rubies"&mdash;is more valuable than the riche&s;t and mo&s;t co&s;tly gems. This de&s;cription of her worth is enhanced, when we read Job's repre&s;entation of wi&s;dom, that excellent gift of God;&mdash;"that it ex|ceeds the gold of ophir&mdash;cannot be valued with the onyx or the &s;apphire&mdash;that it &s;hall not be ex|changed for ve&s;&s;els of fine gold&mdash;that no mention &s;hall be made of coral or of pearls, when in balance with wi&s;dom, for her value is above rubies." The &s;ame language is u&s;ed in the oracles of Omni&s;cience to recommend wi&s;dom, or true religion, as is em|ployed to repre&s;ent unto us, that precious gift, that favour from the Lord, a good wife.</P>
<P>"THE heart of her hu&s;band doth &s;afely tru&s;t in her,"&mdash;in her prudence and knowledge. He is therefore in no fear of wa&s;te or &s;poil by her idlene&s;s,
<PB N="9" REF="023649_0008_0FC08D2E218EDDB8">
extravagance or prodigality.&mdash;So far from this, &s;he &s;hall help him in increa&s;ing his wealth.&mdash;"She &s;hall do him good, and not evil all the days of her life."</P>
<P>HER indu&s;trious di&s;po&s;ition and habits lead "her to &s;eek wool and flax, and &s;he worketh will|ingly with her hands." By this, &s;he is furni&s;hed with means to open a merchandize, which gives her the productions of di&s;tant regions. "Like the merchant &s;hips, &s;he bringeth her food from far&punc;" Here a wide field opens for the di&s;play of her abi|lities and ingenuity.</P>
<P>TO prevent exce&s;&s;ive &s;orrow, and needle&s;s repi|nings, her attendants live by her bounty. She &s;pares not in the pro&s;ecution of her duty toward her dependants, in order to make them faithful and happy, to "ri&s;e while it is yet night, that &s;he may give meat to her hou&s;hold, and a portion to her maidens. She does not totally confine her cares to merchandize, but knowing the value of real pro|perty&mdash;the quality of lands, and importance of agriculture, &s;he con&s;idereth a field and buyeth it. With the earnings of her hand, and fruit &s;elected
<PB N="10" REF="023649_0009_0FC08D41111DBAA8">
by her&s;elf, &s;he planteth a vineyard with the be&s;t twigs, and mo&s;t delicious grapes.</P>
<P>SO FAR is this from being too ma&s;culine or im|proper for her delicate &s;ex, it gives her health and &s;he girdeth her loins with &s;trength, and &s;trengthen|eth her hands by u&s;e. Her cares and exertions pre|&s;ent her with the plea&s;ing &s;ight of beholding that her merchandize is good. She ta&s;tes, &s;ees and knows that it is &s;afe and honourable.</P>
<P>DROWSINESS and &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s are &s;trangers to her. To be always equipped for indu&s;try, her candle go|eth not out by night. She improves all opportu|nities of hone&s;tly increa&s;ing her wealth. Without confiding in the uncertainties that often attend mercantile employments&mdash;without hazarding too far the bla&s;ts and droughts that may injure her crops, or tru&s;ting to the mere accidental fallings of property into her lap, &s;he layeth her hands to the &s;pindle, and her hands hold the di&s;taff.</P>
<P>THESE re&s;ources of commerce, agriculture and manufactures (as is natural) make her rich. She is furni&s;hed thereby with means to do good. She has every nece&s;&s;ary food, cloathing and medicine
<PB N="11" REF="023649_0010_0FC08D4267ACE7F8">
in &s;tore for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. She cheerfully &s;tretcheth out her liberal hand to the poor, and reacheth out her hands to relieve the needy. Her knowledge of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the value of property, awakes a ju&s;t charity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and heightens her enjoy|ments, when &s;he reflects that &s;he has done good.</P>
<P>Do &s;torms ari&s;e?&mdash;Does the wind blow?&mdash;Or is the cold inten&s;e&mdash;the earth covered and air chilled by &s;now?&mdash;She dreads no &s;udden, unprepared for anxieties, le&s;t the health of her hou&s;hold &s;hould be in danger: She has been provident in &s;ea&s;on&mdash; her hou&s;hold are already cloathed for all weathers; with dre&s;s that is warm, decent and valuable&mdash;even with &s;carlet.</P>
<P>HER dome&s;tics being thus equipped for neatne&s;s, and health&mdash;want and di&s;tre&s;s having fled from her abode&mdash;&s;he appears with all her beauties heigh|tened, and her works prai&s;ing her in her attire. With her own hands &s;he maketh her&s;elf coverings of the riche&s;t tape&s;try. Her clothing is &s;ilk and purple. No ruined merchant, mechanic or hu&s;|band are in her train. She has indu&s;triou&s;ly provi|ded for every elegance, without injuring any one.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023649_0011_0FC08D44064A5230">THIS richne&s;s and elegance appears al&s;o in the dre&s;s&mdash;in the valuable embroideries, and various ornaments, which her needle prepares for her hu&s;|band. He is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the riche&s;t garb, and mo&s;t &s;erene countenance among the rulers of the land. No brow of care and dome&s;tic di&s;con|tent attend him to the court or levee. Wi&s;dom, worth and virtue are the important traits, in the character of the man who&s;e joys &s;he improves.</P>
<P>SHE maketh fine linen and &s;elleth it, and deliver|eth girdles to the merchants. Strength and honour, mode&s;ty and equanimity are her clothing. Meek|ne&s;s and quietne&s;s are graces which &s;he cultivates, and con&s;iders as of infinitely greater excellence, far more ornamental, than all the appendages of her wardrobe or toilet. Well may &s;he rejoice in time to come. Her wealth affords all the plea&s;ures which riches can po&s;&s;ibly yield. Her age feels no pinchings from want&mdash;knows no &s;igh for bread.</P>
<P>BUT, her cares are not confined to the property, or pelf of this world&mdash;to her own dre&s;s&mdash;to the ele|gance of her hou&s;e&mdash;the &s;plendor of her hu&s;band&mdash;the chearfulne&s;s of her &s;ervants&mdash;the flouri&s;hing of her traffic&mdash;the fertility of her farms, gardens and vine|yards;
<PB N="13" REF="023649_0012_0FC08D51CAEC7A70">
but, &s;he has al&s;o furni&s;hed her mind with knowledge; with that true wi&s;dom, which works of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>morality</HI> afford. She never opens her mouth to utter <HI>folly.</HI> No <HI>&s;candal</HI>&mdash;no rude, angry, <HI>cruel language</HI> defile her cha&s;te lips. With her tongue dwells the law of kindne&s;s&mdash;the mo&s;t mild and gentle language. She gives an example and affords the precept, in every ju&s;t and tender &s;enti|ment. She con&s;oles the <HI>&s;ick</HI> and <HI>dying</HI>&mdash;&s;he admi|ni&s;ters a balm to chear the <HI>afflicted.</HI> She looks well to the ways of her hou&s;hold, that they con|duct virtuou&s;ly, both in her pre&s;ence and ab&s;ence. She eateth not the bread of idlene&s;s; gained by ex|tortion, or wrong doing: &s;he is not idly &s;auntring abroad or night walking, while her &s;ervants are ri|oting at home.</P>
<P>HERE is a <HI>truly noble per&s;onage,</HI> elevated by her <HI>merit</HI>; &s;he, holds a rank, that no one can deprive her of,&mdash;which always procures re&s;pect, without the trouble of demanding it our&s;elves. Such a woman is more u&s;eful to the world&mdash;gains more honour to her &s;ex&mdash;more ennobles human nature, than many of tho&s;e, who have worn crowns and cor|onets: who have been &s;aluted with the mo&s;t flatter|ing titles&mdash;have been attended with all the parade
<PB N="14" REF="023649_0013_0FC08D5403EE68A0">
of royalty, while they have ruined the minds and morals of thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>THE de&s;cription of this virtuous woman clo&s;es with ob&s;erving, "That her children ri&s;e up and call her ble&s;&s;ed&mdash;her hu&s;band al&s;o and he prai&s;eth her." Doing her duty to them&mdash;making their honour, advancement and felicity, the fir&s;t motive of action&mdash;knowing that they are all embarked in the &s;ame intere&s;t to make each other happy; all other principles give place to this &s;entiment. A|mu&s;ement and di&s;&s;ipation having never been &s;ought by either as a re&s;ource to bani&s;h di&s;content; or made a momentary &s;ub&s;titute, for want of felicity at home. Her partner and children pay her all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect and reverence.&mdash;They extol her virtues&mdash;pa&s;s the &s;mile of joy, and echo of grateful prai&s;e, from each to the other. The children rear|ed by her care, become ble&s;&s;ings to the world and imitators of her perfections.&mdash;They are beheld with veneration and inherit her excellencies. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of worth, more valuable than titles or law can give, de&s;cends to her heirs. Her excellent ex|ample is beheld by others, upon which, to form the u&s;eful and beloved woman, wife, daughter, mother and mi&s;tre&s;s. In the ruins of age, &s;he is ve|nerated,
<PB N="15" REF="023649_0014_0FC08D59D0E33630">
&mdash;is plea&s;ing e'en in death.&mdash;She lives in the memory of many generations.</P>
<P>THO' many daughters have done virtuou&s;ly in many things, yet &s;uch an one excels them all&mdash; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mo&s;t of the real excellencies of the female character, and mu&s;t be neare&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>TO ALL this we may add, that, tho' one could be found in whom were united all tho&s;e things which form the perfect beauty, in the opinion of the pain|ter, &s;tatuary or man of fancy; yet that elegance of form, and motion is often deceitful&mdash;beauty is a fading flower, &s;oon gone, never to be regained by art, nor purcha&s;ed with money, and at be&s;t is vain; yet a woman who feareth the Lord, and follows his laws, &s;hall be prai&s;ed.</P>
<P>WELL may &s;he demand our obedience to the la&s;t ver&s;e in this book and chapter; that we give her of the fruits of her hands&mdash;encourage and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in doing good&mdash;to improve her wealth, and gain the applau&s;e &s;he &s;o ju&s;tly merits.</P>
<P>WHILE Job, Lot, Samp&s;on, and others, in an|cient times, had wives who afflicted and di&s;graced
<PB N="16" REF="023649_0015_0FC08D5B2B2C7D80">
them; Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob, and others, were ble&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e who comforted and did them ho|nour. We read the &s;tory of a pious Hannah&mdash;a prudent Abigail, and a patriotic E&s;ther. The&s;e are examples of great benefit to chri&s;tians in all a|ges. Much care was taken in early times, to &s;elect &s;uch for wives, who had been properly trained to religion and virtuous indu&s;try. Rebecca was ad|dre&s;&s;ed by the Amba&s;&s;ador, who came with a trea|ty of marriage from his ma&s;ter for I&s;aac; and he was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour, while &s;he ho&s;pitably and humanely afforded drink at the well for his re|tinue. Rachel was fir&s;t met and loved by Jacob while &s;he followed the employment of a &s;hepherd's daughter.</P>
<P>WHILE man is called the lord of the creation, and has dominion given him over all things, wo|man taken from his &s;ide, bears his image, and is placed as his companion. Their mutual union is de&s;criptive of the union between Chri&s;t and his church.</P>
<P>IT is our duty in the American States, to pay particular attention to the education of females; that they may pre&s;erve their proper &s;tation; their
<PB N="17" REF="023649_0016_0FC08D5CCEC48C50">
rights and happine&s;s, and be guided in the road to obtain tho&s;e ine&s;timable qualities, piety to God&mdash; reverence to parents&mdash;love and obedience to their hu&s;bands&mdash;tenderne&s;s and watchfulne&s;s over their children&mdash;ju&s;tice and humanity to their dependants.</P>
<P>THIS theme is more important, where early and virtuous marriage is the &s;ource for increa&s;ing the numbers, the wealth and pro&s;perity of a country, and pre&s;erving purity of morals, Idlene&s;s, extra|vagance and pride di&s;courage this. Very few will connect them&s;elves willingly, in holy wedlock, with tho&s;e, who do not in return for love and pro|tection, favour them with generous &s;entiments, in|du&s;try, economy, frugality, neatne&s;s, patience, for|titude, temperance and cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>WERE the opulent duly impre&s;&s;ed with the un|certainty of riches, and how &s;uddenly they may flee away; and were the poor in&s;tructed in the various branches of female indu&s;try, both would e&s;cape one half the mi&s;eries in life.</P>
<P>WHEN hou&s;e, land and friends, are gone forever, the virtuous mind, the well informed head, and hands taught to work, have found new re&s;ources for &s;up|plying
<PB N="18" REF="023649_0017_0FC08D6F9EA3E328">
their wants, which might otherwi&s;e have ended their days, or landed them in de&s;pair. The world is more than half indebted to the female &s;ex, for the pre&s;ervation of religion&mdash;for &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity in &s;ociety, and for peace and happi|ne&s;s in dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>MEN of libertine principles may affect to ridi|cule this &s;ubject; but ob&s;erve their caution, lea&s;t they become the wedded companion of one who is oppo&s;ite to the character of good. How &s;eldom is this the ca&s;e? How frequently do they impo&s;e their vices and infirmities upon the pure&s;t and mo&s;t an|gelic part of the female &s;ex! Their reverential awe, and aukward ba&s;hfulne&s;s in the pre&s;ence of amiable females, proves al&s;o that they revere &s;uch in their hearts. In no company is the profligate &s;o &s;oon &s;ilenced and aba&s;hed, as in that of the good woman I have de&s;cribed. They are wounded at the envi|ed attention and preference that &s;he pays to the &s;u|perior worth, virtue and knowledge of pious and good men. The harrowed brea&s;t&mdash;the jealous h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">d, here &s;hew them&s;elves, by the &s;ilent tongue&mdash; the downca&s;t eye, and prudent retreat.</P>
<P>BY &s;preading &s;uch truths as the&s;e far and wide, we are doing our duty to God&mdash;are in the <HI>only</HI> road to
<PB N="19" REF="023649_0018_0FC08D71A6309898">
&s;ecure the honour and pro&s;perity of our families, and the ble&s;&s;ings of civilization.</P>
<P>THE indu&s;try of the good wife we have de&s;cri|bed, is too important a part of her character to be pa&s;&s;ed over without particular notice. In antient days it was not unfa&s;hionable for a Queen to attend to manufactures; co&s;tly dre&s;s and elegant living were as well, if not better known then, than at pre|&s;ent. It is not <HI>degrading</HI> but <HI>exalting</HI> the female character to &s;ay, that their education is not complete until they are ver&s;ed in the various branches of ma|nufactures which are nece&s;&s;ary for their hou&s;holds; I am proud to confe&s;s that I am &s;upported in the&s;e ideas, by innumerable examples which ladies of the fir&s;t excellence and wealth in America have &s;et. A few voluntary a&s;&s;ociations, or a more frequent exhibition of their indu&s;try in their dre&s;s would ex|tend and pre&s;erve the practice where it is omitted. A knowledge of the di&s;taff, wheel and loom is no di&s;grace, but a glory to the mo&s;t exalted. Every man, by the con&s;titution, is born with an equal right to be elected to the highe&s;t office. And every woman, is born with an equal right to be the wife of the mo&s;t eminent man. Let it therefore be our bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;ee that each be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e virtues
<PB N="20" REF="023649_0019_0FC08D7323FE4F48">
and accompli&s;hments which form the u&s;eful and elevated character. The peculiar nature of the oc|cupations of women, gives them every nece&s;&s;ary art, at a much earlier period in life than men can obtain a knowledge of the laborious and exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s that naturally fails to their &s;hare. The needle and di&s;taff may be early put into the manage|ment of females, and go hand in hand with the important branches of reading, writing, arithmetic, accounts, geography, hi&s;tory and poetry.</P>
<P>THE employments of the needle are one of the branches of in&s;truction in this Academy. The u&s;eful fir&s;t and then the ornamental. This la&s;t opens a broad field to exerci&s;e the ingenuity and amu&s;e the mind, while they are forming a land&s;cape or imitating the various &s;hapes and tinges of a flower, with their needle or pencil, they are im|perceptibly led to admire and adore the power of the Great Creator, who has clothed the lily of the field with greater beauties than Solomon was array|ed with in all his glory. Here the opulent may amu&s;e them&s;elves in decorating their per&s;ons and hou&s;es. Here the indigent may earn bread, by delivering their labours to the merchant, as the women of the ea&s;t did and now do girdles

and other &s;pecimens of indu&s;try. A general diffu|&s;ion of the&s;e branches affords an opportunity for each to follow that to which her fancy leads. Learned women are valuable, but give me leave to ob&s;erve, that indu&s;trious women generally make the be&s;t wives.</P>
<P>MUSIC, and particularly the vocal, de&s;erved|ly demands cultivation; principally as it relates to prai&s;e&mdash;that &s;ublime part of public wor&s;hip, in which every one ought to &s;hare; from which pride or any wrong &s;entiment ought not to lead us to withdraw. Both men and women of the greate&s;t re&s;pectability in our country have, and their children do every Sunday perform a part in choirs and &s;inging &s;eats. Much di&s;couragement ari&s;es on this head from an ungracious reluctance: an affected cough or cold: This often di&s;gu&s;ts and offends&mdash; affords an opportunity to deny that plea&s;ure which enlivens company and cheers the &s;ad. Good &s;ing|ers are often the mo&s;t di&s;obliging per&s;ons we meet with.</P>
<P>DANCING forms a part of education as it be|gets that ea&s;y deportment which makes us appear le&s;s aukward and re&s;trained in company. It is an innocent recreation and relaxation for the &s;edentary.

It promotes health and cheerfulne&s;s. It is part of the amu&s;ement of &s;ocial hours among friends and &s;trangers&mdash;among per&s;ons of various pur&s;uits and principles. It wears away the ru&s;t of prejudice. Seeing each other in their be&s;t dre&s;s and mo&s;t plea|&s;ant face, the blood being &s;et into circulation by motion and mu&s;ic, &s;pleen flies &mdash;harmony reigns, and imperceptibly diffu&s;es its plea&s;ing effects. But all the&s;e, under the &s;tricte&s;t rules of decorum and good order.</P>
<P>THE character of the virtuous woman I have drawn, is from the bible. The thoughts are princi|pally adapted to the pa&s;toral and agricultural &s;tate. The patriarchs and their de&s;cendents in Judea, were principally engaged as &s;hepherds and tillers of the ground. Similar in a great degree is the &s;itua|tion of the United States. Agriculture and manu|factures are the foundation of our national wealth and pro&s;perity; they ought to be promoted by all cla&s;&s;es of citizens. They lead to indu&s;try&mdash;and pre&s;erve health, virtue and piety. The volume of in&s;piration is doubly enhanced, and more worthy to be &s;tudied to form good men and women, as the characters are real. We need not &s;earch the wri|ters of romance and fiction, of poets or fine writers for this purpo&s;e. The heart cannot be &s;o well re|gulated

or head in&s;tructed and u&s;eful manners form|ed, as from that book which al&s;o contains the words of eternal life.&mdash;The grand adver&s;ary of man, never invented a better plan to build up his kingdom, than when he bani&s;hed the bible from &s;chools, and led men of real abilities and learning to join in the &s;y&s;tem, from <HI>affected</HI> reverence to its character.&mdash; Others improving upon the idea, have made it an engine by which to introduce infidelity. If this is not the ca&s;e, why are dei&s;ts and their abettors, &s;o te|nacious and zealous on this head? I hope Ameri|cans will awake to wi&s;dom, and while they avoid &s;e|lecting portions of &s;cripture to be committed to memory by &s;chool-boys as a penance for faults, they will permit it to be read as a privilege in &s;chool, as a mark of honour and favour to tho&s;e who have farthe&s;t advanced in good morals and reading.</P>
<P>No volume affords &s;o u&s;eful a field, for tuning the voice to the various &s;entiments of the writers in order to benefit both reader and hearer as this. The four go&s;pels afford a &s;tile peculiarly adapted to all readers. Many of the mo&s;t celebrated public &s;peakers, in the&s;e States, both in the pulpit and at the bar, were taught reading in the bible: <HI>They</HI> have

They blu&s;h for others, who vilely deba&s;e it to common and improper purpo&s;es. While our citizens retain the bible in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and the reading of it in our &s;chools and families, a mo&s;t important mean is improved, to gain good morals, pure religion and that happy middle-&s;tate between poverty and rich|es. The &s;acred oracles contain a &s;ublimity and purity, which like other excellent productions, nev|er weary by u&s;e. They form pure and elegant manners, free from pomp and o&s;tentation&mdash;from au|&s;terity and gloomine&s;s. There we find all the du|ties to God and our neighbour. There we are taught &s;ubordination to &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>UNDER this la&s;t is included our duty to our in|&s;tructors of every kind. Unle&s;s children know how to <HI>obey,</HI> they will never be qualified to <HI>command.</HI>&mdash; Tho&s;e who are not properly governed at home are &s;eldom orderly in &s;chool, but often di&s;grace them|&s;elves and parents, and injure others by their unto|ward behaviour. Parents and children are to be

pitied for their neglect herein. It is from defects in family government, that magi&s;trates and in&s;truc|tors have much trouble.</P>
<P>WE ought al&s;o to &s;trengthen the hands of in&s;truct|ors and not degrade them. I never envied the feli|city of tho&s;e who have erred on this head;&mdash; bad children, di&s;orderly youth, and proud, unruly men, have amply puni&s;hed them for their impru|dence.&mdash; Very difficult is the ta&s;k to regulate the various tempers in a &s;chool: much patience, forti|tude, wi&s;dom and prudence are nece&s;&s;ary; we ought not therefore to make the ta&s;k doubly ardu|ous, by our childi&s;h inteference.</P>
<P>PRIDE is always ready to intrude it&s;elf to interrupt our ideas on the &s;ubject of female education, and leads many to de&s;pi&s;e indu&s;try, with the pretence that it is not genteel to work: As if we had one order of men, who are to be aggrandized by degrading of another. An American's heart revolts at this idea &mdash;we know and ought to practi&s;e differently.&mdash; True gentility is founded upon chri&s;tian charity&mdash; that be&s;t of graces, which wi&s;hes and endeavours to do good to all; Its votaries are always humble, courteous, affectionate, wi&s;e and gentle.

are often the portion of the vile&s;t of men, they confer no worth upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, any farther than with them he makes others happy. They often con|ceal a wicked and heavy heart. Luxury and fa&s;hions are &s;ometimes &s;tudied and indulged to ca&s;t a veil over real faults, and to compen&s;ate for &s;ub|&s;tantial injuries. He who founds an a&s;ylum for di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;He who introduces an u&s;eful art by which the poor may earn bread, or re&s;cues a fellow mortal from de&s;truction, is more de&s;erving of a &s;tatue, than he who conquers a globe&mdash;and an indu&s;trious good wife is a more noble per&s;onage than a million of fa&s;hionable flutterers. Virtue and merit are not known by title or parade, but by generous, manly, humane, di&s;intere&s;ted actions. Art and addre&s;s often procure means to make an appearance before the world, even in public men; while a country may ba&s;ely leave their mo&s;t meritorious citizens to beggary and in&s;ult from tho&s;e who are exalted by the revolution of tho&s;e affairs, which have made others mi&s;erable. Thus uncertain are all tho&s;e things which dazzle the eye, and lead the heart to place its happine&s;s in the uncertain pomp and pelf of this world.</P>
<P>OUR good or bad fortunes are very little in our power. Providence permits one to ri&s;e and ano|ther

to fall, in the language of mortals; but, many a beggar will be accepted at his bar, when the rich and the gay may be ca&s;t out. The great concern is to maintain our integrity&mdash;to take heed lea&s;t adver&s;ity di&s;courage us, or land us in vice. It is criminal to become wor&s;e by misfortune; but to amend is our glory. When I contemplate the real condition of many female orphans&mdash;the lo&s;&s;es of families from the want of knowledge of bu&s;ine&s;s, in widowed mothers, and the cruel rapine and plunder committed upon their property&mdash;When I recall the lamentations and complaints of many, from men we would blu&s;h to mention, I am irre&s;i&s;tibly drawn to wi&s;h for that fortunate hour, when public or private benevolence will found in&s;titutions al&s;o for depo&s;iting their property or &s;helters for their per|&s;ons, and places for their education.</P>
<P>THAT &s;uch a&s;ylums may be erected is proved by the experiment already made by a <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> com|munion, in our own country; where young females are annualy &s;ent from other places for education. More &s;pecimens of ingenuity, and more u&s;eful ma|nufactures are annually &s;ent from that &s;ociety to market, than from any other place in America. They thereby check co&s;tly importations in this

line from abroad, and derive profit to their com|munity. All the&s;e things are done under the im|mediate direction of their own &s;ex, with a con|&s;tant opportunity to grow in chri&s;tian knowledge; free from temptations to learn or commit wicked|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT becau&s;e we have heard of Roman Catholic nunneries, and <HI>idly</HI> abhor every thing that has the approbation of Papi&s;ts (however <HI>excellent</HI>) we run into the oppo&s;ite extreme. Where is the harm, if men or women chu&s;e a &s;tate of celibacy during the whole or part of their lives? why may they not devote them&s;elves in a retirement, to the duties of piety, humility, humanity and indu&s;try? Is not their labour a &s;ufficient &s;ource of profit to compen|&s;ate for protection? &mdash; But, if we wi&s;h to encourage early marriage, can this be effected in any better way than by giving our youth the be&s;t education, to enable them to maintain them&s;elves and families? Mu&s;t we permit a promi&s;cuous intercour&s;e of both &s;exes&mdash;and give full latitude to all the vi&s;ionary fancies of poets and romance writers on the &s;ubject of love, rather than form &s;y&s;tems of real and per|manent u&s;e; and leave youth expo&s;ed to fortune-hunters and &s;pendthrifts? Men of real virtue prefer

a companion who is not educated among the croud of idlers. Leading or indulging in fa&s;hions and gaiety, confers no real excellence upon men or women: Tho&s;e who do, are the lea&s;t e&s;teemed in the opinion of the wi&s;e and good. True gentility needs no plumes, its own excellencies &s;hine without them.</P>
<P>A VERY powerful argument pre&s;ents it&s;elf upon the &s;ubject of education, as we are a country of pro|fe&s;&s;ed patriots; who have contended for the rights of po&s;terity. Shall we neglect to provide for the in&s;truction of that po&s;terity, and leave them to live and die in ignorance&mdash;and con&s;equently plunge them in vice and de&s;truction? If we do this by our own children, let us not forget the memory of tho&s;e who fought, bled and died in the late war.&mdash;Who have left large families to be guarded and protected by the country; who have not only lo&s;t their pa|rents, but property al&s;o. Shall religion and patri|oti&s;m have no influence with us on this &s;ubject? What mu&s;t po&s;terity &s;ay?&mdash;What will Britons judge of our principles and national character?&mdash; Engage in a war&mdash;call it a war of God&mdash;for the rights of men, and neglect in peace to afford the be&s;t ble&s;&s;ing in life to our young and defencele&s;s citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="023649_0029_0FC08DAF31FE4378">AS OUR children are to be made chri&s;tians and patriots, this &s;ubject is of the highe&s;t national con|cern. It will promote our pro&s;perity far &s;ooner than a fleet or army. Next to good laws and <HI>vir|tuous</HI> lawgivers and rulers, it will promote our highe&s;t pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>ANOTHER important argument, why the educa|tion of youth &s;hould be <HI>national</HI> and not of party care, is that thereby the greate&s;t benefit may ari&s;e to our children, when the encouragement and &s;prings to application are equal. If the rewards for eminence are not in the public gift, men of the fir&s;t character for learning and u&s;efulne&s;s may be neglected becau&s;e they are not the favorites of par|tial &s;y&s;tems. Nay, what is equally to be avoided, they lo&s;e the benefit of tho&s;e in&s;titutions that their fathers and friends have formed and patronized. Until the education of youth is more particularly under the public care than at pre&s;ent, we cannot <HI>decently</HI> a&s;k the aid of a public pur&s;e. If we at|tempt it, we unfairly attempt to draw money from freemen without their con&s;ent, and compel them to &s;upport &s;y&s;tems that con&s;cience leads them to wi&s;h might be altered, and under which many groan.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="023649_0030_0FC08DB0E0552150">THESE are true liberty principles: I deliver them to you in love as a freeman. I am &s;upported in them by many cla&s;&s;es of our be&s;t citizens; their writings, valour and &s;ufferings have &s;ealed their belief in them. By undi&s;gui&s;edly acting up to them, we begin to form a general &s;y&s;tem&mdash;&s;hall prevent rival in&s;titutions from multiplying unne|ce&s;&s;arily, while none are properly &s;upported.

<P>SOME of the&s;e la&s;t thoughts refer principally to literary in&s;titutions, and where parents are opulent. But foundations to make the children of the poor u&s;eful, and to give them an opportunity to reap the benefit of tho&s;e good, and perhaps great abilities, which Heaven has be&s;towed upon them as a rich gift, are equally the objects of public care. They are con&s;idered as &s;uch in other countries. The mechanic and every other art, has been improved, and the world ble&s;&s;ed by their labours, while many who have been born to inherit great e&s;tates, and
