<HEAD>THE TESTIMONY OF FRIENDS IN YORKSHIRE, At their Quarterly-Meeting, held at YORK the 24th and 25th of the third month, 1773, concerning JOHN WOOLMAN, Of Mount-Holly, in the province of New-Jer&s;ey in America, who departed this life at the hou&s;e of our friend Thomas Prie&s;tman, in the &s;uburbs of this city, the 7th of the tenth month, 1772, and was interred in the bury|ing ground of friends the 9th of the &s;ame, aged about fifty two years.</HEAD>
<P>THIS our valuable friend having been under a religious engagement for &s;ome time, to vi&s;it friends in this nation, and more e&s;pecially us in the northern parts, under|took the &s;ame in full concurrence and near &s;ympathy with his friends and brethren at home, as appeared by certificates from the monthly and quarterly meetings to which he belonged, and from the &s;pring-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, held at Philadelphia, for Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="013782_0003_0F91A7627A810148">
He arrived in the city of London the be|ginning of the la&s;t yearly meeting, and after attending that meeting travelled northward, vi&s;iting the quarterly meetings of Hertford|&s;hire, Buckingham&s;hire, Northampton&s;hire, Oxford&s;hire and Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and divers particular meetings in his way.</P>
<P>He vi&s;ited many meetings on the We&s;t &s;ide of this county, al&s;o &s;ome in Lanca&s;hire and We&s;tmoreland, from whence he came to our quarterly meeting in the la&s;t ninth month, and though much out of health, yet was en|abled to attend all the &s;ittings of that meet|ing except the la&s;t.</P>
<P>His di&s;order then, which proved the &s;mall pox, increa&s;ed &s;peedily upon him, and was very afflicting; under which he was &s;upport|ed in much meekne&s;s, patience, and chri&s;ti|an fortitude; to tho&s;e who attended him in his illne&s;s, his mind appeared to be centered in divine love; under the precious influence whereof, we believe he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and entered into the man&s;ions of everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the early part of his illne&s;s he reque&s;ted a friend to write, and he broke forth thus.</P>
<P>"O Lord my God! the amazing horrors of darkne&s;s were gathered around me and co|vered me all over, and I &s;aw no way to go forth; I felt the mi&s;ery of my fellow crea|tures &s;eparated from the divine harmony and it was heavier than I could bear, and I was cru&s;hed down under it; I lifted up my hand, and &s;tretched out my arm, but there was
<PB N="v" REF="013782_0004_0F91A7632E975E40">
none to help me; I looked round about and was amazed: in the depths of mi&s;ery, O Lord! I remembered that thou art omnipo|tent, that I had called thee father, and I felt that I loved thee, and I was made quiet in thy will, and I waited for deliverance from thee; thou had&s;t pity upon me, when no man could help me; I &s;aw that meekne&s;s under &s;uffering was &s;hewed to us in the mo&s;t affect|ing example of thy &s;on, and thou wa&s;t teach|ing me to follow him, and I &s;aid, thy Will, O Father be done."</P>
<P>Many more of his weighty expre&s;&s;ions might have been in&s;erted here, but it was deemed unnece&s;&s;ary, they being already pub|li&s;hed in print.</P>
<P>He was a man endued with a large natural capacity, and being obedient to the mani|fe&s;tations of Divine Grace, having in patience and humility endured many deep bapti&s;ms, he became thereby &s;anctified and fitted for the Lord's work, and was truly &s;erviceable in his church; dwelling in awful fear and watchfulne&s;s, he was careful in his public appearances to feel the putting forth of the Divine Hand, &s;o that the &s;pring of the go&s;pel mini&s;try often flowed through him with great &s;weetne&s;s and purity, as a refre&s;hing &s;tream to the weary travellers towards the city of God: &s;ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lfull in dividing the word, he was furni&s;hed by Him in whom are hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge, to com|municate freely to the &s;everal &s;tates of the
<PB N="vi" REF="013782_0005_0F91A763EF1540D0">
people where his lot was ca&s;t. His conduct at other times was &s;ea&s;oned with the like watchful circum&s;pection and attention to the guidance of Divine Wi&s;dom, which rendered his whole conver&s;ation uniformly edifying.</P>
<P>He was fully per&s;uaded that as the life of Chri&s;t comes to reign in the earth, all abu&s;e and unnece&s;&s;ary oppre&s;&s;ion, both of the hu|man and brute creation will come to an end; but under the &s;en&s;e of a deep revolt, and an overflowing &s;tream of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, his life has been often a life of mourning.</P>
<P>He was deeply concerned on account of that inhuman and iniquitous practice of making &s;laves of the people of Africa, or holding them in that &s;tate; and on that ac|count we under&s;tand he hath not only wrote &s;ome books, but travelled much on the con|tinent of America, in order to make the Ne|gro ma&s;ters (e&s;pecially tho&s;e in profe&s;&s;ion with us) &s;en&s;ible of the evil of &s;uch a practice; and though in this journey to England, he was far removed from the outward &s;ight of their &s;ufferings, yet his deep exerci&s;e of mind re|mained, as appears by a &s;hort treati&s;e he wrote in this journey, and his frequent con|cern to open the mi&s;erable &s;tate of this deep|ly injured people: his te&s;timony in the la&s;t meeting he attended was on this &s;ubject, wherein he remarked, that as we as a &s;ociety, when under outward &s;ufferings had often found it our concern to lay them before tho&s;e in authority, and thereby in the Lord's time,
<PB N="vii" REF="013782_0006_0F91A765EB7D6C40">
had obtained relief, &s;o he recommended this oppre&s;&s;ed part of the creation to our notice, that we may as way may open, repre&s;ent their &s;ufferings in an individual, if not a &s;o|ciety, capacity to tho&s;e in authority.</P>
<P>Deeply &s;en&s;ible that the de&s;ire to gratify people's inclinations in luxury and &s;uperflui|ties, is the principal ground of oppre&s;&s;ion, and the occa&s;ion of many unnece&s;&s;ary wants, he believed it to be his duty to be a pattern of great &s;elf-denial, with re&s;pect to the things of this life, and earne&s;tly to labour with friends in the meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, to im|pre&s;s on their minds the great importance of our te&s;timony in the&s;e things, recommending to the guidance of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth in this and all other concerns, and cautioning &s;uch as are experienced therein, again&s;t contenting them&s;elves with acting up to the &s;tandard of others, but to be careful to make the &s;tand|ard of truth manife&s;ted to them, the mea&s;ure of their obedience; for &s;aid he, "That pu|rity of life which proceeds from faithfulne&s;s in following the Spirit of Truth, that &s;tate where our minds are devoted to &s;erve God, and all our wants are bounded by his wi&s;|dom; this habitation has often been opened before me as a place of retirement for the children of the light, where they may &s;tand &s;eparated from that which di&s;ordereth and confu&s;eth the affairs of &s;ociety, and where we may have a te&s;timony of our innocence in the hearts of tho&s;e who behold us."</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="013782_0007_0F91A76663403350">
We conclude with fervent de&s;ires, that we as a people may thus, by our example, pro|mote the Lord's work in the earth; and our hearts being prepared, may unite in prayer to the great Lord of the harve&s;t, that as in his infinite wi&s;dom he hath greatly &s;tripped the church, by removing of late divers faith|ful mini&s;ters and elders, he may be plea&s;ed to &s;end forth many more faithful labourers into his harve&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY OF THE MONTHLY-MEETING OF FRIENDS, Held in Burlington, the fir&s;t day of the eighth month, in the year of our Lord, 1774, concerning our e&s;teemed friend JOHN WOOLMAN, DECEASED.</HEAD>
<P>HE was born in Northampton, in the county of Burlington, and province of We&s;t-New-Jer&s;ey, in the eighth month, 1720, of religious parents, who in&s;tructed him very early in the principles of the chri&s;tian religi|on, as profe&s;&s;ed by the people called Quakers, which he e&s;teemed a ble&s;&s;ing to him, even in his young years, tending to pre&s;erve him from the infection of wicked children; but through the workings of the enemy, and le|vity incident to youth, he frequently deviated from tho&s;e parental precepts, by which he laid a renewed foundation for repentance, that was finally &s;ucceeded by a godly &s;orrow not to be repented of, and &s;o became ac|quainted with that &s;anctifying power which qualifies for true go&s;pel mini&s;try, into which he was called about the twenty-&s;econd year of his age, and by a faithful u&s;e of the ta|lents committed to him, he experienced an encrea&s;e, until he arrived at the &s;tate of a fa|ther,
<PB N="x" REF="013782_0009_0F91A769BB747198">
capable of dividing the word aright to the different &s;tates he mini&s;tered unto; di&s;|pen&s;ing milk to babes, and meat to tho&s;e of riper years. Thus he found the efficacy of that power to ari&s;e, which in his own ex|pre&s;&s;ions, "prepares the creature to &s;tand like a trumpet through which the Lord &s;peaks to his people."&mdash;He was a loving hu&s;band, a tender father, and very humane to every part of the creation under his care.</P>
<P>His concern for the poor and tho&s;e in af|fliction was evident by his vi&s;its to them; whom he frequently relieved by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and charity. He was for many years deeply exerci&s;ed on account of the poor en&s;laved A|fricans, who&s;e cau&s;e, as he &s;ometimes men|tioned, lay almo&s;t continually upon him, and to obtain liberty to tho&s;e captives, he la|boured both in public and private; and was favoured to &s;ee his endeavours crowned with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. He was particularly de&s;irous that friends &s;hould not be in&s;tru|mental to lay burthens on this oppre&s;&s;ed peo|ple, but remember the days of &s;uffering from which they had been providentially delivered, that if times of trouble &s;hould return, no in|ju&s;tice dealt to tho&s;e in &s;lavery might ri&s;e in judgment again&s;t us, but, being clear, we might on &s;uch occa&s;ions addre&s;s the Almigh|ty with a degree of confidence, for his inter|po&s;ition and relief, being particularly careful as to him&s;elf, not to countenance &s;lavery even by the u&s;e of tho&s;e conveniencies of life which were furni&s;hed by their labour.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="013782_0010_0F91A76AB1228590">
He was de&s;irous to have his own, and the minds of others, redeemed from the plea&s;ures and immoderate profits of this world, and to fix them on tho&s;e joys which fade not away; his principal care being after a life of purity, endeavouring to avoid not only the gro&s;&s;er pollutions, but tho&s;e al&s;o which, appearing in a more refined dre&s;s, are not &s;ufficiently guarded again&s;t by &s;ome well di&s;po&s;ed peo|ple. In the latter part of his life he was re|markable for the plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of his dre&s;s, and as much as po&s;&s;ible, avoided the u&s;e of plate, co&s;tly furniture and fea&s;ting; thereby endeavouring to become an example of temperance and &s;elf-denial, which he be|lieved him&s;elf called unto; and was favour|ed with peace therein, altho' it carried the appearance of great au&s;terity in the view of &s;ome. He was very moderate in his charges in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s, and in his de&s;ires af|ter gain; and tho' a man of indu&s;try, avoid|ed, and &s;trove much to lead others out of ex|treme labour, and anxiou&s;ne&s;s after peri&s;hable things; being de&s;irous that the &s;trength of our bodies might not be &s;pent in procuring things unprofitable, and that we might u&s;e moderation and kindne&s;s to the brute animals under our care, to prize the u&s;e of them as a great favour, and by no means abu&s;e them; that the gifts of Providence &s;hould be thank|fully received and applied to the u&s;es they were de&s;igned.</P>
<P>He &s;everal times opened a &s;chool at Mount-Holly, for the in&s;truction of poor friends
<PB N="xii" REF="013782_0011_0F91A76B73BC6668">
children and others, being concerned for their help and improvement therein:&mdash;his love and care for the ri&s;ing youth among us was truly great, recommending to parents and tho&s;e who have the charge of them, to chu&s;e con|&s;cientious and pious tutors, &s;aying, "It is a lovely &s;ight to behold innocent children," and that "to labour for their help again&s;t that which would marr the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them."</P>
<P>His mini&s;try was &s;ound, very deep and pe|netrating, &s;ometimes pointing out the dan|gerous &s;ituation which indulgence and cu&s;|tom leads into; frequently exhorting others, e&s;pecially the youth, not to be di&s;couraged at the difficulties which occur, but pre&s;s after purity. He often expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t en|gagement that <HI>pure wi&s;dom</HI> &s;hould be attend|ed to, which would lead into lowline&s;s of mind and re&s;ignation to the divine will, in which &s;tate &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions here would be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In tran&s;acting the affairs of di&s;cipline, his judgment was &s;ound and clear, and he was very u&s;eful in treating with tho&s;e who had done ami&s;s; he vi&s;ited &s;uch in a private way in that plainne&s;s which truth dictates, &s;hewing great tenderne&s;s and chri&s;tian for|bearance. He was a con&s;tant attender of our yearly-meeting, in which he was a good ex|ample, and particularly u&s;eful; a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the bu&s;ine&s;s thereof with great weight and at|tention. He &s;everal times vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings of friends in this and the neigh|bouring
<PB N="xiii" REF="013782_0012_0F91A76C30754218">
provinces, with the concurrence of the monthly-meeting to which he belonged, and we have rea&s;on to believe had good &s;er|vice therein, generally or always expre&s;&s;ing at his return how it had fared with him, and the evidence of peace in his mind for thus performing his duty. He was often concern|ed with other friends in the important &s;ervice of vi&s;iting families, which he was enabled to go through to &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In the minutes of the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders for this quarter, at the foot of a li&s;t of the members of that meeting, made about five years before his death, we find in his hand writing the following ob&s;ervation and reflections. "As looking over the mi|nutes made by per&s;ons who have put off this body, hath &s;ometimes revived in me a thought how ages pa&s;s away; &s;o this li&s;t may proba|bly revive a like thought in &s;ome, when I and the re&s;t of the per&s;ons abovenamed, are cen|tered in another &s;tate of being.&mdash;The Lord, who was the guide of my youth, hath in ten|der mercies helped me hitherto; he hath healed me of wounds, he hath helped me out of grievous entanglements; he remains to be the &s;trength of my life; to whom I de&s;ire to devote my&s;elf in time, and in eternity."&mdash;<HI>Signed,</HI> John Woolman.</P>
<P>In the twelfth month, 1771, he acquaint|ed this meeting that he found his mind drawn towards a religious vi&s;it to friends in &s;ome parts of England, particularly in York&s;hire. In the fir&s;t month 1772, he obtained our cer|tificate, which was approved and endor&s;ed by
<PB N="xiv" REF="013782_0013_0F91A76E261DE388">
our quarterly meeting, and by the half year's meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at Philadel|phia. He embarked on his voyage in the fifth, and arrived in London in the &s;ixth month following, at the time of their annual meeting in that city. During his &s;hort vi&s;it to friends in that kingdom, we are informed that his &s;ervices were acceptable and edifying. In his la&s;t illne&s;s he uttered many lively and comfortable expre&s;&s;ions, being "perfectly re&s;igned, having no will either to live or die," as appears by the te&s;timony of friends at York in Great-Britain, in the &s;uburbs whereof, at the hou&s;e of our friend Thomas Prie&s;tman, he died of the &s;mall-pox, on the &s;eventh day of the tenth month, 1772, and was buried in friends burying ground in that city, on the ninth of the &s;ame, after a large and &s;olid meeting held on the occa&s;ion, at their great meeting-hou&s;e, aged near fifty-two years; a mini&s;ter upwards of thirty years, during which time he belonged to Mount-Holly particular meeting, which he diligently at|tended when at home and in health of body, and his labours of love and pious care for the pro&s;perity of friends in the ble&s;&s;ed truth, we hope may not be forgotten, but that his good works may be remembered to edification.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>His birth and parentage, with &s;ome account of the operations of divine grace on his mind in his youth&mdash;His fir&s;t appearance in the mini|&s;try&mdash;And his con&s;iderations, while young, on the keeping of &s;laves.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I HAVE often felt a motion of love to leave &s;ome hints in writing of my ex|perience of the goodne&s;s of God: and now, in the thirty-&s;ixth year of my age, I begin this work.</P>
<P>I was born in Northampton, in Burling|ton county, We&s;t-Jer&s;ey, in the Year 1720; and before I was &s;even years old I began to
<PB N="2" REF="013782_0016_0F91A7701C9DC670">
be acquainted with the operations of divine love. Through the care of my parents, I was taught to read near as &s;oon as I was capable of it; and as I went from &s;chool one &s;eventh day, I remember, while my companions went to play by the way, I went forward out of &s;ight, and &s;itting down, I read the 22d chap|ter of the Revelations. <Q>He &s;hewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as chry|&s;tal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, &amp;c.</Q> and in reading it, my mind was drawn to &s;eek after that pure habitation, which, I then believed, God had prepared for his &s;ervants. The place where I &s;ate, and the &s;weetne&s;s that attended my mind, remains fre&s;h in my memory.</P>
<P>This, and the like gracious vi&s;itations, had that effect upon me, that when boys u&s;ed ill language, it troubled me; and, through the continued mercies of God, I was pre|&s;erved from it.</P>
<P>The pious in&s;tructions of my parents were often fre&s;h in my mind when I happened to be among wicked children, and were of u&s;e to me. My parents, having a large family of children, u&s;ed frequently, on fir&s;t days after meeting, to put us to read in the holy &s;criptures, or &s;ome religious books, one after another, the re&s;t &s;itting by without much conver&s;ation; which, I have &s;ince often thought, was a good practice. From what I had read and heard, I believed there had been, in pa&s;t ages, peo|ple who walked in uprightne&s;s before God, in a degree exceeding any that I knew, or
<PB N="3" REF="013782_0017_0F91A770AC8FD640">
heard of, now living: and the apprehen&s;ion of there being le&s;s &s;teadine&s;s and firmne&s;s among&s;t people in this age than in pa&s;t ages, often troubled me while I was a child.</P>
<P>A thing remarkable in my childhood was, that once going to a neighbour's hou&s;e, I &s;aw, on the way, a robin &s;itting on her ne&s;t, and as I came near &s;he went off, but having young ones flew about, and with many cries expre&s;&s;ed her concern for them; I &s;tood and threw &s;tones at her, till one &s;trik|ing her, &s;he fell down dead: at fir&s;t I was plea&s;ed with the exploit, but after a few mi|nutes was &s;eized with horror, as having, in a &s;portive way, killed an innocent creature while &s;he was careful for her young: I be|held her lying dead, and thought tho&s;e young ones, for which &s;he was &s;o careful, mu&s;t now peri&s;h for want of their dam to nouri&s;h them; and after &s;ome painful con&s;iderations on the &s;ubject, I climbed up the tree, took all the young birds, and killed them; &s;uppo&s;ing that better than to leave them to pine away and die mi&s;erably: and believed, in this ca&s;e, that &s;cripture proverb was fulfilled, <Q>The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</Q> I then went on my errand, but, for &s;ome hours, could think of little el&s;e but the cru|elties I had committed, and was much trou|bled.

become tender-hearted and &s;ympathizing; but being frequently and totally rejected, the mind becomes &s;hut up in a contrary di&s;po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>About the twelfth year of my age, my father being abroad, my mother reproved me for &s;ome mi&s;conduct, to which I made an undutiful reply; and the next fir&s;t day, as I was with my father returning from meeting, he told me he under&s;tood I had behaved ami&s;s to my mother, and advi&s;ed me to be more careful in future. I knew my&s;elf blameable, and in &s;hame and confu|&s;ion remained &s;ilent. Being thus awakened to a &s;en&s;e of my wickedne&s;s, I felt remor&s;e in my mind, and getting home, I retired and prayed to the Lord to forgive me; and do not remember that I ever, after that, &s;poke unhand&s;omely to either of my parents, how|ever fooli&s;h in &s;ome other things.</P>
<P>Having attained the age of &s;ixteen years, I began to love wanton company; and though I was pre&s;erved from profane language, or &s;candalous conduct, &s;till I perceived a plant in me which produced much wild grapes: yet my merciful Father for&s;ook me not utterly, but at times, through his grace, I was brought &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider my ways; and the &s;ight of my back&s;lidings affected me with &s;orrow; but for want of rightly attending to the re|proofs of in&s;truction, vanity was added to vanity, and repentance to repentance: upon the whole, my mind was more and more ali|enated from the truth, and I ha&s;tened to|ward
<PB N="5" REF="013782_0019_0F91A774E35FE0B0">
de&s;truction. While I meditate on the gulf towards which I travelled, and reflect on my youthful di&s;obedience, for the&s;e things I weep, mine eye runneth down with water.</P>
<P>Advancing in age the number of my ac|quaintance increa&s;ed, and thereby my way grew more difficult: though I had found comfort in reading the holy &s;criptures, and thinking on heavenly things, I was now e&s;tranged therefrom: I knew I was going from the flock of Chri&s;t, and had no re&s;olu|tion to return; hence &s;erious reflections were unea&s;y to me, and youthful vanities and di|ver&s;ions my greate&s;t plea&s;ure. Running in this road I found many like my&s;elf; and we a&s;&s;ociated in that which is rever&s;e to true friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>But in this &s;wift race it plea&s;ed God to vi|&s;it me with &s;ickne&s;s, &s;o that I doubted of recovering; and then did darkne&s;s, horror, and amazement, with full force, &s;eize me, even when my pain and di&s;tre&s;s of body was very great. I thought it would have been better for me never to have had a being, than to &s;ee the day which I now &s;aw. I was filled with confu&s;ion; and in great affliction, both of mind and body, I lay and bewailed my|&s;elf. I had not confidence to lift up my cries to God, whom I had thus offended; but, in a deep &s;en&s;e of my great folly, I was hum|bled before him: and, at length, that Word which is as a fire and a hammer, broke and di&s;&s;olved my rebellious heart, and then my cries were put up in contrition; and in the
<PB N="6" REF="013782_0020_0F91A7753B29A140">
multitude of his mercies I found inward re|lief, and felt a clo&s;e engagement, that if he was plea&s;ed to re&s;tore my health, I might walk humbly before him.</P>
<P>After my recovery, this exerci&s;e remained with me a con&s;iderable time; but, by de|grees, giving way to youthful vanities, they gained &s;trength, and getting with wanton young people I lo&s;t ground. The Lord had been very gracious, and &s;poke peace to me in the time of my di&s;tre&s;s; and I now mo&s;t ungratefully turned again to folly; on which account, at times, I felt &s;harp reproof, but did not get low enough to cry for help. I was not &s;o hardy as to commit things &s;can|dalous; but to exceed in vanity, and pro|mote mirth, was my chief &s;tudy. Still I re|tained a love and e&s;teem for pious people; and their company brought an awe upon me. My dear parents, &s;everal times, admoni&s;hed me in the fear of the Lord, and their ad|monition entered into my heart, and had a good effect for a &s;ea&s;on; but not getting deep enough to pray rightly, the tempter, when he came, found entrance. I remem|ber, once having &s;pent a part of the day in wantonne&s;s as I went to bed at night, there lay in a window, near my bed, a bible, which I opened, and fir&s;t ca&s;t my eye on the text, <Q>we lie down in our &s;hame, and our confu&s;ion covers us;</Q> this I knew to be my ca&s;e: and meeting with &s;o unexpected a reproof, I was &s;omewhat affected with it, and
<PB N="7" REF="013782_0021_0F91A775F2B36E60">
went to bed under remor&s;e of con&s;cience; which I &s;oon ca&s;t off again.</P>
<P>Thus time pa&s;t on: my heart was reple|ni&s;hed with mirth and wantonne&s;s, while plea&s;ing &s;cenes of vanity were pre&s;ented to my imagination, till I attained the age of eighteen years; near which time I felt the judgments of God, in my &s;oul, like a con|&s;uming fire; and looking over my pa&s;t life, the pro&s;pect was moving.&mdash;I was often &s;ad, and longed to be delivered from tho&s;e vani|ties; then again, my heart was &s;trongly in|clined to them, and there was in me a &s;ore conflict: at times I turned to folly; and then again, &s;orrow and confu&s;ion took hold of me. In a while, I re&s;olved totally to leave off &s;ome of my vanities; but there was a &s;ecret re&s;erve in my heart, of the more refined part of them, and I was not low enough to find true peace. Thus, for &s;ome months, I had great troubles; there remaining in me an un|&s;ubjected will, which rendered my labours fruitle&s;s, till at length, through the merciful continuance of heavenly vi&s;itations, I was made to bow down in &s;pirit before the Lord. I remember one evening I had &s;pent &s;ome time in reading a pious author; and walking out alone, I humbly prayed to the Lord for his help, that I might be delivered from all tho&s;e vanities which &s;o en&s;nared me. Thus being brought low, he helped me; and as I learned to bear the cro&s;s, I felt refre&s;hment to come from his pre&s;ence; but not keeping in that &s;trength which gave victory, I lo&s;t ground
<PB N="8" REF="013782_0022_0F91A776C08C6D38">
again; the &s;en&s;e of which greatly affected me: and I &s;ought de&s;erts and lonely places, and there with tears did confe&s;s my &s;ins to God, and humbly craved help of him. And I may &s;ay with reverence, he was near to me in my troubles, and in tho&s;e times of humi|liation opened my ear to di&s;cipline. I was now led to look &s;eriou&s;ly at the means by which I was drawn from the pure truth, and learned this, that if I would live in the life which the faithful &s;ervants of God lived in, I mu&s;t not go into company as heretofore in my own will; but all the cravings of &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be governed by a divine principle. In times of &s;orrow and aba&s;ement the&s;e in&s;truc|tions were &s;ealed upon me, and I felt the power of Chri&s;t prevail over &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ires, &s;o that I was pre&s;erved in a good degree of &s;tea|dine&s;s; and being young, and believing, at that time, that a &s;ingle life was be&s;t for me, I was &s;trengthened to keep from &s;uch com|pany as had often been a &s;nare to me.</P>
<P>I kept &s;teadily to meetings; &s;pent fir&s;t days afternoon chiefly in reading the &s;criptures and other good books; and was early con|vinced in my mind, that true religion con|&s;i&s;ted in an inward life, wherein the heart doth love and reverence God the Creator, and learns to exerci&s;e true ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s, not only toward all men, but al&s;o toward the brute creatures&mdash;That as the mind was mov|ed, by an inward principle, to love God as an invi&s;ible incomprehen&s;ible Being; by the &s;ame principle it was moved to love him in
<PB N="9" REF="013782_0023_0F91A7777A568648">
all his manife&s;tations in the vi&s;ible world&mdash;That, as by his breath, the flame of life was kindled in all animal &s;en&s;ible creatures, to &s;ay we love God as un&s;een, and, at the &s;ame time, exerci&s;e cruelty toward the lea&s;t creature mov|ing by his life, or by life derived from him; was a contradiction in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I found no narrowne&s;s re&s;pecting &s;ects and opinions; but believed, that &s;incere upright hearted people, in every &s;ociety, who truly love God, were accepted of him.</P>
<P>As I lived under the cro&s;s, and &s;imply fol|lowed the openings of truth, my mind, from day to day, was more enlightened; my for|mer acquaintance were left to judge of me as they would, for I found it &s;afe&s;t for me to live in private, and keep the&s;e things &s;ealed up in my own brea&s;t. While I &s;ilently pon|der on that change wrought in me, I find no language equal to it, nor any means to con|vey to another a clear idea of it. I looked upon the works of God in this vi&s;ible crea|tion, and an awfulne&s;s covered me; my heart was tender and often contrite, and univer&s;al love to my fellow-creatures increa&s;ed in me: this will be under&s;tood by &s;uch who have trodden in the &s;ame path. Some glances of real beauty may be &s;een in their faces, who dwell in true meekne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a harmony in the &s;ound of that voice to which divine love gives utterance, and &s;ome appearance of right order in their temper and conduct, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are re|gulated; yet all the&s;e do not fully &s;hew forth
<PB N="10" REF="013782_0024_0F91A7782DC335C0">
that inward life to &s;uch who have not felt it: but this white &s;tone and new name is known rightly to &s;uch only who have it.</P>
<P>Now though I had been thus &s;trengthened to bear the cro&s;s, I &s;till found my&s;elf in great danger, having many weakne&s;&s;es attending me, and &s;trong temptations to wre&s;tle with; in the feeling whereof I frequently withdrew into private places, and often with tears be|&s;ought the Lord to help me, who&s;e gracious ear was open to my cry.</P>
<P>All this time I lived with my parents, and wrought on the plantation; and having had &s;chooling pretty well for a planter, I u&s;ed to improve it in winter-evenings, and other lei|&s;ure times; and being now in the twenty-fir&s;t year of my age, a man, in much bu&s;i|ne&s;s at &s;hop-keeping and baking, a&s;ked me, if I would hire with him to tend &s;hop and keep books. I acquainted my father with the propo&s;al; and, after &s;ome deliberation, it was agreed for me to go.</P>
<P>At home I had lived retired; and now hav|ing a pro&s;pect of being much in the way of company, I felt frequent and fervent cries in my heart to God, the Father of mercies, that he would pre&s;erve me from all taint and cor|ruption; that, in this more public employ|ment, I might &s;erve Him, my gracious Re|deemer, in that humility and &s;elf-denial, with which I had been, in a &s;mall degree, ex|erci&s;ed in a more private life. The man, who employed me, furni&s;hed a &s;hop in Mount-Holly, about five miles from my father's
<PB N="11" REF="013782_0025_0F91A778EFB57C58">
hou&s;e, and &s;ix from his own; and there I lived alone, and tended his &s;hop. Shortly af|ter my &s;ettlement here, I was vi&s;ited by &s;eve|ral young people my former acquaintance, who knew not but vanities would be as agree|able to me now as ever; and, at the&s;e times, I cried to the Lord in &s;ecret for wi&s;dom and &s;trength; for I felt my&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed with difficulties, and had fre&s;h occa&s;ion to bewail the follies of time pa&s;t, in contracting a fa|miliarity with libertine people: and as I had now left my father's hou&s;e outwardly, I found my heavenly Father to be merciful to me be|yond what I can expre&s;s.</P>
<P>By day I was much among&s;t people, and had many trials to go through; but in the evenings, I was mo&s;tly alone, and may with thankfulne&s;s acknowledge, that, in tho&s;e times, the &s;pirit of &s;upplication was often poured upon me; under which I was fre|quently exerci&s;ed, and felt my &s;trength re|newed.</P>
<P>In a few months after I came here, my ma&s;ter bought &s;everal Scotchmen &s;ervants, from on board a ve&s;&s;el, and brought them to Mount-Holly to &s;ell; one of which was ta|ken &s;ick, and died.</P>
<P>In the latter part of his &s;ickne&s;s, he, being delirious, u&s;ed to cur&s;e and &s;wear mo&s;t &s;or|rowfully; and the next night after his buri|al, I was left to &s;leep alone in the &s;ame cham|ber where he died: I perceived in me a timo|rou&s;ne&s;s; I knew, however, I had not injured the man, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted in taking care of him
<PB N="12" REF="013782_0026_0F91A779ADD14368">
according to my capacity; and was not free to a&s;k any one, on that occa&s;ion, to &s;leep with me: nature was feeble; but every tryal was a fre&s;h incitement to give my&s;elf up wholly to the &s;ervice of God, for I found no helper like him in times of trouble.</P>
<P>After a while, my former acquaintance gave over expecting me as one of their company; and I began to be known to &s;ome who&s;e con|ver&s;ation was helpful to me: and now, as I had experienced the love of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to redeem me from many pol|lutions, and to be a &s;uccour to me through a &s;ea of conflicts, with which no per&s;on was fully acquainted; and as my heart was often enlarged in this heavenly principle, I felt a tender compa&s;&s;ion for the youth, who re|mained entangled in &s;nares like tho&s;e which had entangled me from one time to another: this love and tenderne&s;s increa&s;ed; and my mind was more &s;trongly engaged for the good of my fellow-creatures. I went to meetings in an awful frame of mind, and endeavoured to be inwardly acquainted with the language of the true Shepherd; and one day, being under a &s;trong exerci&s;e of &s;pirit, I &s;tood up, and &s;aid &s;ome words in a meeting; but not keeping clo&s;e to the divine opening, I &s;aid more than was required of me; and being &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of my error, I was afflicted in mind &s;ome weeks, without any light or comfort, even to that degree that I could not take &s;atisfac|tion in any thing: I remembered God, and was troubled; and, in the depth of my di&s;|tre&s;s,
<PB N="13" REF="013782_0027_0F91A77D1F11E738">
he had pity upon me, and &s;ent the Comforter: I then felt forgivene&s;s for my of|fence, and my mind became calm and quiet, being truly thankful to my gracious Re|deemer for his mercies; and after this, feel|ing the &s;pring of divine love opened, and a concern to &s;peak, I &s;aid a few words in a meeting, in which I found peace; this, I believe, was about &s;ix weeks from the fir&s;t time: and, as I was thus humbled and di&s;|ciplined under the cro&s;s, my under&s;tanding became more &s;trengthened to di&s;tingui&s;h the pure &s;pirit which inwardly moves upon the heart, and taught me to wait in &s;ilence &s;ome|times many weeks together, until I felt that ri&s;e which prepares the creature to &s;tand like a trumpet, through which the Lord &s;peaks to his flock.</P>
<P>From an inward purifying, and &s;tedfa&s;t abiding under it, &s;prings a lively operative de&s;ire for the good of others: all the faith|ful are not called to the public mini&s;try; but whoever are, are called to mini&s;ter of that which they have ta&s;ted and handled &s;piritu|ally. The outward modes of wor&s;hip are va|rious; but wherever any are true mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it is from the operation of his &s;pirit upon their hearts, fir&s;t purifying them, and thus giving them a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the conditions of others.</P>
<P>This truth was early fixed in my mind; and I was taught to watch the pure opening, and to take heed, le&s;t, while I was &s;tanding to &s;peak, my own will &s;hould get uppermo&s;t,
<PB N="14" REF="013782_0028_0F91A77E2A10DC20">
and cau&s;e me to utter words from worldly wi&s;dom, and depart from the channel of the true go&s;pel mini&s;try. In the management of my outward affairs, I may &s;ay with thank|fulne&s;s, I found truth to be my &s;upport; and I was re&s;pected in my ma&s;ter's family, who came to live in Mount-Holly within two years after my going there.</P>
<P>About the twenty-third year of my age, I had many fre&s;h and heavenly openings, in re&s;pect to the care and providence of the Al|mighty over his creatures in general, and over man as the mo&s;t noble among&s;t tho&s;e which are vi&s;ible. And being clearly con|vinced in my judgment, that to place my whole tru&s;t in God was be&s;t for me, I felt re|newed engagements, that in all things I might act on an inward principle of virtue, and pur&s;ue worldly bu&s;ine&s;s no further, than as truth opened my way therein.</P>
<P>About the time called Chri&s;tmas, I ob&s;erv|ed many people from the country, and dwell|ers in town, who, re&s;orting to publick-hou&s;es, &s;pent their time in drinking and vain &s;ports, tending to corrupt one another; on which account I was much troubled. At one hou&s;e in particular there was much di&s;order; and I believed it was a duty incumbent on me to go and &s;peak to the ma&s;ter of that hou&s;e. I con|&s;idered I was young, and that &s;everal elderly friends in town had opportunity to &s;ee the&s;e things; but though I would gladly have been excu&s;ed, yet I could not feel my mind clear.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013782_0029_0F91A7801E0253C8">
The exerci&s;e was heavy: and as I was read|ing what the Almighty &s;aid to Ezekiel, re|&s;pecting his duty as a watchman, the matter was &s;et home more clearly; and then, with prayers and tears, I be&s;ought the Lord for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who, in loving-kindne&s;s, gave me a re&s;igned heart: then, at a &s;uitable op|portunity, I went to the publick-hou&s;e; and &s;eeing the man among&s;t much company, I went to him, and told him, I wanted to &s;peak with him; &s;o we went a&s;ide, and there, in the fear and dread of the Almighty, I expre&s;t to him what re&s;ted on my mind; which he took kindly, and afterward &s;hewed more re|gard to me than before. In a few years af|terwards he died, middle-aged; and I of|ten thought, that had I neglected my duty in that ca&s;e, it would have given me great trouble; and I was humbly thankful to my gracious Father, who had &s;upported me here|in.</P>
<P>My employer having a negro woman, &s;old her, and de&s;ired me to write a bill of &s;ale, the man being waiting who bought her: the thing was &s;udden; and though the thoughts of writing an in&s;trument of &s;lavery for one of my fellow-creatures felt unea&s;y, yet I re|membered I was hired by the year, that it was my ma&s;ter who directed me to do it, and that it was an elderly man, a member of our &s;ociety, who bought her; &s;o, through weak|ne&s;s, I gave way, and wrote it; but, at the executing it, I was &s;o afflicted in my mind, that I &s;aid, before my ma&s;ter and the friend,

that I believed &s;lave-keeping to be a practice incon&s;i&s;tent with the chri&s;tian religion: this in &s;ome degree abated my unea&s;ine&s;s; yet, as often as I reflected &s;eriou&s;ly upon it, I thought I &s;hould have been clearer, if I had de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from it, as a thing again&s;t my con|&s;cience; for &s;uch it was.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY esteemed friend Abraham Farring|ton, being about to make a visit to friends on the eastern side of this province, and having no companion, he proposed to me to go with him; and after a conference with some elderly friends, I agreed to go: so we set out the fifth day of the ninth month, in the year 1743; had an evening meeting at a tavern in Brunswick, a town in which none of our society dwelt; the room was full, and the people quiet. Thence to Amboy, and had an evening meeting in the court-house; to which came many people, amongst whom were several members of assembly, they be|ing in town on the public affairs of the pro|vince.
<PB N="18" REF="013782_0032_0F91A781EE396F60">
in both the&s;e meetings my antient companion was enlarged to preach, in the love of the go&s;pel. Thence we went to Wood-bridge, Raway, and Plainfield; and had &s;ix or &s;even meetings in places where friends meetings are not u&s;ually held, being made up chiefly of pre&s;byterians, and my beloved companion was frequently &s;trength|ened to publi&s;h the word of life among&s;t them: as for me, I was often &s;ilent thro' the meetings; and when I &s;pake, it was with much care, that I might &s;peak only what truth opened: my mind was often ten|der, and I learned &s;ome profitable le&s;&s;ons. We were out about two weeks.</P>
<P>Near this time, being on &s;ome outward bu|&s;ine&s;s in which &s;everal families were concern|ed, and which was attended with difficulties, &s;ome things relating thereto not being clearly &s;tated, nor rightly under&s;tood by all, there aro&s;e &s;ome heat in the minds of the parties, and one valuable friend got off his watch; I had a great regard for him, and felt a &s;trong inclination, after matters were &s;ettled, to &s;peak to him concerning his conduct in that ca&s;e; but I being a youth, and he far advanced in age and experience, my way appeared diffi|cult; but after &s;ome days deliberation, and inward &s;eeking to the Lord for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I was made &s;ubject; &s;o that I expre&s;t what lay upon me, in a way which became my youth and his years: and though it was a hard ta&s;k to me, it was well taken, and, I believe, was u&s;eful to us both.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="013782_0033_0F91A782C5F8EA58">
Having now been &s;everal years with my employer, and he doing le&s;s at merchandize than heretofore, I was thoughtful of &s;ome other way of bu&s;ine&s;s; perceiving merchan|dize to be attended with much cumber, in the way of trading in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>My mind, through the power of truth, was in a good degree weaned from the de&s;ire of outward greatne&s;s, and I was learning to be content with real conveniencies, that were not co&s;tly; &s;o that a way of life, free from much entanglements, appeared be&s;t for me, tho' the income might be &s;mall. I had &s;everal offers of bu&s;ine&s;s that appeared profitable, but did not &s;ee my way clear to accept of them; as believing the bu&s;ine&s;s propo&s;ed would be attended with more outward care and cumber than was required of me to engage in.</P>
<P>I &s;aw that a humble man, with the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord, might live on a little: and that where the heart was &s;et on greatne&s;s, &s;ucce&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s did not &s;atisfy the craving; but that commonly with an increa&s;e of wealth, the de&s;ire of wealth increa&s;ed. There was a care on my mind &s;o to pa&s;s my time, that nothing might hinder me from the mo&s;t &s;teady attention to the voice of the true Shep|herd.</P>
<P>My employer, though now a retailer of goods, was by trad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a taylor, and kept a &s;ervant man at that bu&s;ine&s;s; and I began to think about learning the trade, expecting, that if I &s;hould &s;ettle, I might, by this trade, and a little retailing of goods, get a living
<PB N="20" REF="013782_0034_0F91A783C36E0188">
in a plain way, without the load of great bu&s;ine&s;s: I mentioned it to my employer, and we &s;oon agreed on terms; and then, when I had lei&s;ure from the affairs of mer|chandize, I worked with his man. I believed the hand of Providence pointed out this bu|&s;ine&s;s for me; and was taught to be content with it, though I felt, at times, a di&s;po&s;ition that would have &s;ought for &s;omething great|er: but, through the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I had &s;een the happine&s;s of humility, and there was an earne&s;t de&s;ire in me to en|ter deep into it; and, at times, this de&s;ire aro&s;e to a degree of fervent &s;upplication, wherein my &s;oul was &s;o environed with hea|venly light and con&s;olation, that things were made ea&s;y to me which had been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, my employer's wife died; &s;he was a virtuous woman, and generally be|loved of her neighbours: and &s;oon after this, he left &s;hopkeeping; and we parted. I then wrought at my trade, as a taylor; carefully attended meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline; and found an enlargement of go&s;pel love in my mind, and therein a concern to vi&s;it friends in &s;ome of the back &s;ettlements of Penn&s;ylvania and Virginia; and being thoughtful about a companion, I expre&s;&s;ed it to my beloved friend I&s;aac Andrews, who then told me that he had drawings to the &s;ame places; and al&s;o to go through Mary|land, Virginia, and Carolina. After con&s;i|derable time pa&s;t, and &s;everal conferences with him, I felt ea&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o accompany him

throughout, if way opened for it. I opened the ca&s;e in our monthly meeting, and friends expre&s;&s;ing their unity therewith, we obtained certificates to travel as companions; his from Haddonfield, and mine from Burlington.</P>
<P>We left our province on the twelfth day of the third month, in the year 1746, and had &s;everal meetings in the upper part of Che&s;ter county, and near Lanca&s;ter; in &s;ome of which, the love of Chri&s;t prevailed, uni|ting us together in his &s;ervice. Then we cro&s;&s;ed the river Su&s;quehannah, and had &s;e|veral meetings in a new &s;ettlement, called the Red-Lands; the olde&s;t of which, as I was informed, did not exceed ten years. It is the poorer &s;ort of people that commonly begin to improve remote de&s;erts: with a &s;mall &s;tock they have hou&s;es to build, lands to clear and fence, corn to rai&s;e, cloaths to provide, and children to educate; that friends, who vi&s;it &s;uch, may well &s;ympathize with them in their hard&s;hips in the wilderne&s;s; and though the be&s;t entertainment &s;uch can give, may &s;eem coar&s;e to &s;ome who are u&s;ed to cities, or old &s;ettled places, it becomes the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t to be content with it. Our hearts were &s;ometimes enlarged in the love of our heavenly Father among&s;t the&s;e people; and the &s;weet influence of his &s;pirit &s;up|ported us through &s;ome difficulties: to him be the prai&s;e.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed on to Manoquacy, Fairfax, Hopewell, and Shanando, and had meet|ings; &s;ome of which were comfortable and
<PB N="22" REF="013782_0036_0F91A78672CE5518">
edifying. From Shanando we &s;et off in the afternoon for the old &s;ettlements of friends in Virginia; and the fir&s;t night, we, with our pilot, lodged in the woods, our hor&s;es feed|ing near us; but he being poorly provided with a hor&s;e, and we young and having good hor&s;es, were free the next day to part with him; and did &s;o. In two days after, we reached to our friend John Cheagle's, in Vir|ginia: &s;o we took the meetings in our way through Virginia; were, in &s;ome degree, baptized into a feeling &s;en&s;e of the condi|tions of the people; and our exerci&s;e in ge|neral was more painful in the&s;e old &s;ettle|ments, than it had been among&s;t the back inhabitants: but through the goodne&s;s of our heavenly Father, the well of living-wa|ters was, at times, opened to our encou|ragement, and the refre&s;hment of the &s;incere hearted. We went on to Perquimons, in North-Carolina; had &s;everal meetings, which were large; and found &s;ome openne&s;s in tho&s;e parts, and a hopeful appearance among&s;t the young people. So we turned again to Virginia, and attended mo&s;t of the meetings which we had not been at before, labouring among&s;t friends in the love of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as ability was given: and thence went to the mountains, up James River, to a new &s;ettle|ment; and had &s;everal meetings among&s;t the people, &s;ome of whom had lately joined in member&s;hip with our &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In our journeying to and fro, we found &s;ome hone&s;t-hearted friends, who appeared
<PB N="23" REF="013782_0037_0F91A78A12A554A8">
to be concerned for the cau&s;e of truth among a back&s;liding people.</P>
<P>From Virginia, we cro&s;&s;ed over the river Patowmac, at Hoe's ferry, and made a gene|ral vi&s;it to the meetings of friends on the We&s;tern Shore of Maryland; and were at their quarterly meeting. We had &s;ome hard labour among&s;t them, endeavouring to di&s;|charge our duty hone&s;tly as way opened, in the love of truth: and thence taking &s;undry meetings in our way, we pa&s;&s;ed homeward; where, through the favour of Divine Provi|dence, we reached the &s;ixteenth day of the &s;ixth month, in the year 1746; and I may &s;ay, that through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit, which mortifies &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ires, my companion and I travelled in harmony, and parted in the nearne&s;s of true brotherly love.</P>
<P>Two things were remarkable to me in this journey: fir&s;t, in regard to my entertain|ment; when I eat, drank, and lodged free-co&s;t with people, who lived in ea&s;e on the hard labour of their &s;laves, I felt unea&s;y; and as my mind was inward to the Lord, I found, from place to place, this unea&s;ine&s;s return upon me, at times, through the whole vi&s;it. Where the ma&s;ters bore a good &s;hare of the burthen, and lived frugally, &s;o that their &s;ervants were well provided for, and their labour moderate, I felt more ea&s;y; but where they lived in a co&s;tly way, and laid heavy burthens on their &s;laves, my exerci&s;e was often great, and I frequently had con|ver&s;ation with them, in private, concerning
<PB N="24" REF="013782_0038_0F91A78A34846D70">
it. Secondly: this trade of importing &s;laves from their native country being much en|couraged among&s;t them, and the white peo|ple and their children &s;o generally living without much labour, was frequently the &s;ubject of my &s;erious thoughts: and I &s;aw in the&s;e &s;outhern provinces &s;o many vices and corruptions, increa&s;ed by this trade and this way of life, that it appeared to me as a dark gloomine&s;s hanging over the land; and though now many willingly run into it, yet in future the con&s;equence will be grievous to po&s;terity: I expre&s;s it as it hath appeared to me, not at once, nor twice, but as a matter fixed on my mind.</P>
<P>Soon after my return home, I felt an in|crea&s;ing concern for friends on our &s;ea coa&s;t; and on the eighth day of the eighth month, in the year 1746, with the unity of friends, and in company with my beloved friend and neighbour Peter Andrews, brother to my companion before-mentioned, we &s;et for|ward, and vi&s;ited meetings generally about Salem, Cape May, Great and Little Egg-Harbour; and had meetings at Barnagat, Mannahockin, and Mane-Squan, and &s;o to the yearly meeting at Shrew&s;bury. Through the goodne&s;s of the Lord way was opened, and the &s;trength of divine love was &s;ometimes felt in our a&s;&s;emblies, to the comfort and help of tho&s;e who were rightly concerned be|fore him. We were out twenty-two days, and rode, by computation, three hundred and forty miles. At Shrew&s;bury yearly meet|ing,
<PB N="25" REF="013782_0039_0F91A78B52B5B028">
we met with our dear friends Michael Lightfoot and Abraham Farrington, who had good &s;ervice there.</P>
<P>The winter following died my elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, Elizabeth Woolman, jun. of the &s;mall-pox, aged thirty-one years. She was, from her youth, of a thoughtful di&s;po&s;ition; and very compa&s;&s;ionate to her acquaintance in their &s;ickne&s;s or di&s;tre&s;s, being ready to help as far as &s;he could. She was dutiful to her parents; one in&s;tance whereof follows:&mdash;It happened that &s;he, and two of her &s;i&s;ters, be|ing then near the e&s;tate of young women, had an inclination one fir&s;t day after meet|ing to go on a vi&s;it to &s;ome other young women at &s;ome di&s;tance off; who&s;e compa|ny, I believe, would have done them no good. They expre&s;t their de&s;ire to our pa|rents; who were di&s;&s;atisfied with the propo|&s;al, and &s;topped them. The &s;ame day, as my &s;i&s;ters and I were together, and they talking about their di&s;appointment, Eliza|beth expre&s;t her contentment under it; &s;ig|nifying, &s;he believed it might be for their good.</P>
<P>A few years after &s;he attained to mature-age, through the gracious vi&s;itations of God's love, &s;he was &s;trengthened to live a &s;elf-deny|ing exemplary life, giving her&s;elf much to reading and meditation.</P>

<P>The fore part of her illne&s;s &s;he was in great &s;adne&s;s and dejection of mind, of which &s;he told one of her intimate friends, and &s;aid, when I was a young girl I was wanton and airy, but I thought I had tho|roughly repented for it; and added, I have of late had great &s;atisfaction in meetings.

Of late I found drawings in my mind to vi&s;it friends in New-England, and having an opportunity of joining in company with my beloved friend Peter Andrews; we, hav|ing obtained certificates from our monthly meeting, &s;et forward on the &s;ixteenth day of the third month, in the year 1747, and reached the yearly meeting at Long-I&s;land; at which were our friends Samuel Notting|ham from England, John Griffith, Jane Ho&s;kins, and Elizabeth Hud&s;on from Penn|&s;ylvania, and Jacob Andrews from Che&s;ter|field. Several of whom were favoured in their publick exerci&s;e; and, through the goodne&s;s of the Lord, we had &s;ome edifying meetings. After this, my companion and I vi&s;ited friends on Long-I&s;land; and, through the mercies of God, we were helped in the work.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides going to the &s;ettled meetings of friends, we were at a general meeting at Se|tawket, chiefly made up of other &s;ocieties: and had a meeting at Oy&s;ter-Bay, in a dwelling-hou&s;e, at which were many people: at the fir&s;t of which there was not much &s;aid by way of te&s;timony; but was, I believe, a good meeting: at the latter, through the &s;pringing up of living-waters, it was a day to be thankfully remembered. Having vi&s;ited the i&s;land, we went over to the main, taking meetings in our way, to Oblong, Nine-Part|ners and New-Milford.&mdash;In the&s;e back &s;ettle|ments we met with &s;everal people, who, through the immediate workings of the &s;pi|rit
<PB N="29" REF="013782_0043_0F91A78E014D6B78">
of Chri&s;t on their minds, were drawn from the vanities of the world, to an inward ac|quaintance with him: they were educated in the way of the pre&s;byterians. A con&s;iderable number of the youth, members of that &s;ociety, were u&s;ed to &s;pend their time often together in merriment, but &s;ome of the principal young men of that company being vi&s;ited by the powerful workings of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, and thereby led humbly to take up his cro&s;s, could no longer join in tho&s;e vanities; and as the&s;e &s;tood &s;tedfa&s;t to that inward con|vincement, they were made a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ome of their former companions; &s;o that, through the power of truth, &s;everal were brought into a clo&s;e exerci&s;e concerning the eternal well-being of their &s;ouls. The&s;e young people continued for a time to frequent their pub|lick wor&s;hip; and be&s;ides that, had meetings of their own; which meetings were a while allowed by their preacher, who &s;ometimes met with them: but, in time, their judg|ment in matters of religion di&s;agreeing with &s;ome of the articles of the pre&s;byterians, their meetings were di&s;approved by that &s;o|ciety; and &s;uch of them who &s;tood firm to their duty, as it was inwardly manife&s;ted, had many difficulties to go through: and their meetings were in a while dropped; &s;ome of them returning to the pre&s;byterians, and others of them, after a time, joined to our religious &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I had conver&s;ation with &s;ome of the latter, to my help and edification; and believe &s;eve|ral
<PB N="30" REF="013782_0044_0F91A78EAD4F4DE0">
of them are acquainted with the nature of that wor&s;hip, which is performed in &s;pirit and in truth. From hence, accompanied by Amos Powel, a friend from Long-I&s;land, we rode through Connecticut, chiefly inha|bited by pre&s;byterians; who were generally civil to us, &s;o far as I &s;aw: and after three days riding, we came among&s;t friends in the colony of Rhode-I&s;land. We vi&s;ited friends in and about Newport, and Dartmouth, and generally in tho&s;e parts; and then to Bo&s;ton; and proceeded ea&s;tward as far as Dover: and then returned to Newport, and not far from thence, we met our friend Thomas Gaw|throp from England; who was then on a vi|&s;it to the&s;e provinces. From Newport we &s;ailed to Nantucket; were there near a week; and from thence came over to Dartmouth: and having fini&s;hed our vi&s;it in the&s;e parts, we cro&s;&s;ed the Sound from New-London to Long-I&s;land; and taking &s;ome meetings on the i&s;land, proceeded homeward; where we reached the thirteenth day of the &s;eventh month, in the year 1747, having rode about fifteen hundred miles, and &s;ailed about one hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>In this journey, I may &s;ay in general, we were &s;ometimes in much weakne&s;s, and la|boured under di&s;couragements; and at other times, through the renewed manife&s;tations of divine love, we had &s;ea&s;ons of refre&s;hment, wherein the power of truth prevailed.</P>
<P>We were taught, by renewed experience, to labour for an inward &s;tillne&s;s; at no time
<PB N="31" REF="013782_0045_0F91A7921D945F58">
to &s;eek for words, but to live in the &s;pirit of truth, and utter that to the people which truth opened in us. My beloved companion and I belonged both to one meeting, came forth in the mini&s;try near the &s;ame time, and were inwardly united in the work: he was about thirteen years older than I, bore the heavie&s;t burthen, and was an in&s;trument of the greate&s;t u&s;e.</P>
<P>Finding a concern to vi&s;it friends in the Lower Counties on Delaware, and on the Ea&s;tern Shore of Maryland, and having an opportunity to join with my well-beloved antient friend John Sykes, we obtained cer|tificates, and &s;et off the &s;eventh day of the eighth month, in the year 1748, were at the meetings of friends in the lower counties, attended the yearly meeting at Little Creek, and made a vi&s;it to chief of the meetings on the Ea&s;tern Shore; and &s;o home by the way of Nottingham: were abroad about &s;ix weeks; and rode, by computation, about five hun|dred and fifty miles.</P>
<P>Our exerci&s;e, at times, was heavy; but, through the goodne&s;s of the Lord, we were of|ten refre&s;hed: and I may &s;ay, by experience, "He is a &s;trong hold in the day of trouble." Though our &s;ociety, in the&s;e parts, appeared to me to be in a declining condition; yet, I believe, the Lord hath a people among&s;t them, who labout to &s;erve him uprightly, but have many difficulties to encounter.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT this time believing it good for me to &s;ettle, and thinking &s;eriou&s;ly a|bout a companion, my heart was turned to the Lord with de&s;ires that he would give me wi&s;dom to proceed therein agreeable to his will; and He was plea&s;ed to give me a well-inclined dam&s;el, Sarah Ellis; to whom I was married the eighteenth day of the eighth month, in the year 1749.</P>
<P>In the fall of the year 1750 died my fa|ther, Samuel Woolman, with a fever, aged about &s;ixty years.</P>
<P>In his life-time he manife&s;ted much care for us his children, that in our youth we might learn to fear the Lord; often endea|vouring to imprint in our minds the true principles of virtue, and particularly to che|ri&s;h in us a &s;pirit of tenderne&s;s, not only to|wards
<PB N="33" REF="013782_0047_0F91A7932E0A83A8">
poor people, but al&s;o towards all crea|tures of which we had the command.</P>
<P>After my return from Carolina in the year 1746, I made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on keeping &s;laves, which &s;ome time before his decea&s;e I &s;hewed him; and he peru&s;ed the manu&s;cript, propo&s;ed a few alterations, and appeared well &s;atisfied that I found a concern on that ac|count: and in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, as I was watching with him one night, he being &s;o far &s;pent that there was no expectation of his recovery, but had the perfect u&s;e of his un|der&s;tanding, he a&s;ked me concerning the ma|nu&s;cript, whether I expected &s;oon to proceed to take the advice of friends in publi&s;hing it? and, after &s;ome conver&s;ation thereon, &s;aid, I have all along been deeply affected with the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor negroes; and now, at la&s;t, my concern for them is as great as ever.</P>
<P>By his direction, I had wrote his will in a time of health, and that night he de&s;ired me to read it to him, which I did; and he &s;aid, it was agreeable to his mind. He then made mention of his end, which he believed was now near; and &s;ignified, that though he was &s;en&s;ible of many imperfections in the cour&s;e of his life, yet his experience of the power of truth, and of the love and goodne&s;s of God from time to time, even till now, was &s;uch, that he had no doubt but that in leav|ing this life he &s;hould enter into one more happy.</P>
<P>The next day his &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth came to &s;ee him, and told him of the decea&s;e of their
<PB N="34" REF="013782_0048_0F91A793FB8F4C98">
&s;i&s;ter Ann; who died a few days before: he then &s;aid, I reckon &s;i&s;ter Ann was free to leave this world? Elizabeth &s;aid, &s;he was: he then &s;aid, I al&s;o am free to leave it; and being in great weakne&s;s of body &s;aid, I hope I &s;hall &s;hortly go to re&s;t. He continued in a weighty frame of mind, and was &s;en&s;ible till near the la&s;t.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day of the ninth month, in the year 1751, feeling drawings in my mind to vi&s;it friends at the Great Meadows, in the upper part of We&s;t-Jer&s;ey, with the unity of our monthly-meeting, I went there; and had &s;ome &s;earching laborious exerci&s;e among&s;t friends in tho&s;e parts, and found inward peace therein.</P>
<P>In the ninth month of the year 1753, in company with my well-e&s;teemed friend John Sykes, and with the unity of friends, we travelled about two weeks, vi&s;iting friends in Bucks-County. We laboured in the love of the go&s;pel, according to the mea&s;ure re|ceived; and, through the mercies of Him, who is &s;trength to the poor who tru&s;t in him, we found &s;atisfaction in our vi&s;it: and in the next winter, way opening to vi&s;it friends fa|milies within the compa&s;s of our monthly-meeting, partly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y the labours of two friends from Penn&s;ylvania, I joined in &s;ome part of the work; having had a de&s;ire &s;ome time that it might go forward among&s;t us.</P>
<P>About this time, a per&s;on at &s;ome di&s;tance lying &s;ick, his brother came to me to write his will: I knew he had &s;laves; and a&s;king
<PB N="35" REF="013782_0049_0F91A794B64AE530">
his brother, was told he intended to leave them as &s;laves to his children. As writing is a profitable employ, and as offending &s;ober people was di&s;agreeble to my inclination, I was &s;traitened in my mind; but as I looked to the Lord, he inclined my heart to his te&s;|timony: and I told the man, that I believed the practice of continuing &s;lavery to this people was not right; and had a &s;cruple in my mind again&s;t doing writings of that kind: that though many in our &s;ociety kept them as &s;laves, &s;till I was not ea&s;y to be con|cerned in it; and de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from going to write the will. I &s;pake to him in the fear of the Lord; and he made no reply to what I &s;aid, but went away: he al&s;o had &s;ome concerns in the practice; and I thought he was di&s;plea&s;ed with me. In this ca&s;e I had a fre&s;h confirmation, that acting con|trary to pre&s;ent outward intere&s;t, from a mo|tive of divine love, and in regard to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and thereby incurring the re&s;entments of people, opens the way to a trea&s;ure better than &s;ilver, and to a friend|&s;hip exceeding the friend&s;hip of men.</P>
<P>The manu&s;cript before-mentioned having laid by me &s;everal years, the publication of it re&s;ted weightily upon me; and this year I offered it to the revi&s;al of friends, who, hav|ing examined and made &s;ome &s;mall altera|tions in it, directed a number of copies there|of to be publi&s;hed and di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t friends.</P>

In the year 1754, I found my mind drawn to join in a vi&s;it to friends families belonging to Che&s;terfield monthly-meeting; and hav|ing the approbation of our own, I went to their monthly-meeting in order to confer with friends, and &s;ee if way opened for it: I had conference with &s;ome of their mem|bers, the propo&s;al having been opened before in their meeting, and one friend agreed to join with me as a companion for a begin|ning; but when meeting was ended, I felt great di&s;tre&s;s of mind, and doubted what way to take, or whether to go home and wait for greater clearne&s;s: I kept my di&s;tre&s;s &s;e|cret; and going with a friend to his hou&s;e, my de&s;ires were to the great Shepherd for his heavenly in&s;truction; and in the morning I felt ea&s;y to proceed on the vi&s;it, being very low in my mind: and as mine eye was turn|ed to the Lord, waiting in families in deep reverence before him, he was plea&s;ed graci|ou&s;ly to afford help; &s;o that we had many comfortable opportunities, and it appeared as a fre&s;h vi&s;itation to &s;ome young people.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an humble &s;en&s;e of divine goodne&s;s, and the gracious continuation of God's love to his people, we tenderly &s;alute you; and are at this time therein engaged in mind, that all of us who profe&s;s the truth, as held forth and publi&s;hed by our worthy predece&s;&s;ors in this latter age of the world, may keep near to that life which is the light of men, and be &s;trengthened to hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith without wavering, that our tru&s;t may not be in man, but in the Lord alone, who ruleth in the army of heaven, and in the kingdoms of men, before whom the earth is as the du&s;t of the ballance, and her inha|bitants as gra&s;shoppers.

We (being convinced that the gracious de|&s;ign of the Almighty in &s;ending his Son in|to the world, was to repair the breach made by di&s;obedience, to fini&s;h &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, that his kingdom might come, and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven) have found it to be our duty to cea&s;e from tho&s;e national conte&s;ts productive of mi&s;ery and blood&s;hed, and &s;ubmit our cau&s;e to Him the Mo&s;t High, who&s;e tender love to his chil|dren exceeds the mo&s;t warm affections of na|tural parents, and who hath promi&s;ed to his &s;eed throughout the earth, as to one indivi|dual, <Q>I will never leave thee, nor for&s;ake thee.</Q> Heb. xiii. 5. And as we, through the gracious dealings of the Lord our God, have had experience of that work which is carried on, <Q>not by <HI>earthly</HI> might, nor by power, but by my &s;pirit, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts:</Q> Zech. iv. 6. By which opera|tion, that &s;piritual kingdom is &s;et up, which is to &s;ubdue and break in pieces all king|doms that oppo&s;e it, and &s;hall &s;tand for ever. In a deep &s;en&s;e thereof, and of the &s;afety, &s;tability and peace there is in it, we are de|&s;irous that all who profe&s;s the truth, may be inwardly acquainted with it, and thereby be qualified to conduct in all parts of our life as becomes our peaceable profe&s;&s;ion: And we tru&s;t, as there is a faithful continuance to depend wholly upon the almighty arm, from one generation to another, the peacea|ble kingdom will gradually be extended <Q>from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the river to the

<P>And, dearly beloved friends, &s;eeing we have the&s;e promi&s;es, and believe that God is begin|ning to fulfil them, let us con&s;tantly endeavour to have our minds &s;ufficiently di&s;entangled from the &s;urfeiting cares of this life, and re|deemed from the love of the world, that no earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions nor enjoyments may bias our judgments, or turn us from that re&s;igna|tion, and entire tru&s;t in God, to which his ble&s;&s;ing is mo&s;t &s;urely annexed; then may we &s;ay, <Q>Our Redeemer is mighty, he will plead our cau&s;e for us.</Q> Jer. 1. 34. And if, for the further promoting his mo&s;t gracious purpo&s;es in the earth, he &s;hould give us to ta&s;te of that bitter cup which his faithful ones have often partook of; O that we may be rightly prepared to receive it!</P>
<P>And now, dear friends, with re&s;pect to the commotions and &s;tirrings of the powers of the earth at this time near us, we are de&s;i|rous that none of us may be moved thereat; <Q>But repo&s;e our&s;elves in the munition of that rock that all the&s;e &s;hakings &s;hall not move, even in the knowledge and feeling of the eternal power of God, keeping us &s;ubjectly given up to his heavenly will, and feel it daily to mortify that which remains in any of us which is of this world: for

the worldly part in any, is the changeable part, and that is up and down, full and empty, joyful and &s;orrowful, as things go well or ill in this world; for as the truth is but one, and many are made partakers of its &s;pirit, &s;o the world is but one, and many are made partakers of the &s;pirit of it; and &s;o many as do partake of it, &s;o many will be &s;traitened and perplexed with it: but they who are &s;ingle to the truth, waiting daily to feel the life and virtue of it in their hearts, the&s;e &s;hall rejoice in the mid&s;t of adver&s;ity,</Q> and have to experience with the prophet, That <Q>Although the fig-tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om, neither &s;hall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> fail, and the fields &s;hall yield no meat; the flock &s;hall be cut off from the fold, and there &s;hall be no herd in the &s;talls; yet will <HI>they</HI> rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of <HI>their</HI> &s;alvation.</Q> Hab. iii. 17, 18.</P>

<P>Scrupling to do writings relative to keep|ing &s;laves, having been a means of &s;undry &s;mall trials to me, in which I have &s;o evi|dently felt my own will &s;et a&s;ide, that I think it good to mention a few of them&mdash;Trade&s;|men and retailers of goods, who depend on their bu&s;ine&s;s for a living, are naturally in|clined to keep the good-will of their cu&s;tom|ers; nor is it a plea&s;ant thing for young men to be under any nece&s;&s;ity to que&s;tion the judgment or hone&s;ty of elderly men, and more e&s;pecially of &s;uch who have a fair re|putation. Deep-rooted cu&s;toms, tho' wrong, are not ea&s;ily altered; but it is the duty of every one to be firm in that which they cer|tainly know is right for them. A charitable benevolent man, well acquainted with a ne|gro, may, I believe, under &s;ome circum|&s;tances, keep him in his family as a &s;ervant, on no other motives than the negroe's good; but man, as man knows not what &s;hall be af|ter him, nor hath he any a&s;&s;urance that his children will attain to that perfection in wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s nece&s;&s;ary rightly to exer|ci&s;e &s;uch power: hence it is clear to me, that I ought not to be the &s;cribe where wills are
<PB N="42" REF="013782_0056_0F91A79E75A86788">
drawn, in which &s;ome children are made ab|&s;olute ma&s;ters over others during life.</P>
<P>About this time, an antient man of good e&s;teem in the neighbourhood, came to my hou&s;e to get his will wrote; he had young negroes; and I a&s;ked him privately, how he purpo&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e of them? he told me: I then &s;aid, I cannot write thy will without breaking my own peace; and re&s;pectfully gave him my rea&s;ons for it: he &s;ignified that he had a choice that I &s;hould have wrote it; but as I could not, con&s;i&s;tent with my con|&s;cience, he did not de&s;ire it: and &s;o he got it wrote by &s;ome other per&s;on. And a few years after, there being great alterations in his family, he came again to get me to write his will: his negroes were yet young; and his &s;on, to whom he intended to give them, was, &s;ince he fir&s;t &s;poke to me, from a liber|tine, become a &s;ober young man; and he &s;uppo&s;ed, that I would have been free, on that account, to write it. We had much friendly talk on the &s;ubject, and then de|ferred it: and a few days after, he came again, and directed their freedom; and &s;o I wrote his will.</P>
<P>Near the time the la&s;t mentioned friend fir&s;t &s;poke to me, a neighbour received a bad brui&s;e in his body, and &s;ent for me to bleed him; which being done, he de&s;ired me to write his will: I took notes; and, among&s;t other things, he told me to which of his children he gave his young negro: I con&s;i|dered the pain and di&s;tre&s;s he was in, and
<PB N="43" REF="013782_0057_0F91A79F790221A8">
knew not how it would end; &s;o I wrote his will, &s;ave only that part concerning his &s;lave, and carrying it to his bed-&s;ide, read it to him; and then told him in a friendly way, that I could not write any in&s;truments by which my fellow-creatures were made &s;laves, without bringing trouble on my own mind: I let him know that I charged nothing for what I had done; and de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from doing the other part in the way he propo&s;ed: we then had a &s;erious conference on the &s;ubject; at length, he agreeing to &s;et her free, I fini&s;hed his will.</P>
<P>Having found drawings in my mind to vi&s;it friends on Long-I&s;land, after obtaining a certificate from our monthly-meeting, I &s;et off on the twelfth day of the fifth month, in the year 1756. When I reached the i&s;land, I lodged the fir&s;t night at the hou&s;e of my dear friend Richard Halle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: the next day, be|ing the fir&s;t of the week, I was at the meet|ing in Newtown; in which we experienced the renewed manife&s;tations of the love of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, to the comfort of the hone&s;t-hearted. I went that night to Flu&s;hing; and the next day, in company with my be|loved friend Matthew Franklin, we cro&s;&s;ed the ferry at White-Stone; were at three meet|ings on the main, and then returned to the i&s;land; where I &s;pent the remainder of the week in vi&s;iting meetings. The Lord, I be|lieve, hath a people in tho&s;e parts, who are hone&s;tly inclined to &s;erve him; but many, I fear, are too much clogged with the things of this life, and do not come forward bear|ing
<PB N="44" REF="013782_0058_0F91A7A3189BF510">
the cro&s;s in &s;uch faithfulne&s;s as he calls for.</P>
<P>My mind was deeply engaged in this vi&s;it, both in public and private; and, at &s;everal places where I was, on ob&s;erving that they had &s;laves, I found my&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity, in a friendly way, to labour with them on that &s;ubject; expre&s;&s;ing, as way opened, the incon&s;i&s;tency of that practice with the purity of the chri&s;tian religion, and the ill effects of it manife&s;ted among&s;t us.</P>
<P>The latter end of the week, their yearly-meeting began; at which were our friends John Scarbrough, Jane Ho&s;kins, and Su&s;an|nah Brown, from Penn&s;ylvania: the publick meetings were large, and mea&s;urably favour|ed with divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of my mind, at this meeting, was chiefly on account of tho&s;e who were con&s;idered as the foremo&s;t rank in the &s;oci|ety: and in a meeting of mini&s;ters and el|ders, way opened, that I expre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure what lay upon me; and at a time when friends were met for tran&s;acting the affairs of the church, having &s;et a while &s;i|lent, I felt a weight on my mind, and &s;tood up; and, through the gracious regard of our heavenly Father, &s;trength was given fully to clear my&s;elf of a burthen, which for &s;ome days had been increa&s;ing upon me.</P>
<P>Through the humbling di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence, men are &s;ometimes fitted for his &s;ervice. The me&s;&s;ages of the prophet Jeremiah were &s;o di&s;agreeable to the people,
<PB N="45" REF="013782_0059_0F91A7A6CF75F648">
and &s;o rever&s;e to the &s;pirit they lived in, that he became the object of their reproach; and in the weakne&s;s of nature, thought of de&s;i&s;t|ing from his prophetick office; but, &s;aith he, <Q>His word was in my heart as a burning fire &s;hut up in my bones; and I was weary with forbearing, and could not &s;tay.</Q> I &s;aw at this time, that if I was hone&s;t in de|claring that which truth opened in me, I could not plea&s;e all men; and laboured to be content in the way of my duty, however di&s;agreeable to my own inclination. After this I went homeward, taking Woodbridge and Plainfield in my way; in both which meetings, the pure influence of divine love was manife&s;ted; in an humbling &s;en&s;e where|of I went home: having been out about twenty-four days, and rode about three hundred and &s;ixteen miles.</P>
<P>While I was out on this journey, my heart was much affected with a &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of the churches in our &s;outhern provinces; and believing the Lord was calling me to &s;ome further labour among&s;t them, I was bowed in reverence before him, with fervent de&s;ires that I might find &s;trength to re&s;ign my&s;elf up to his heavenly will.</P>
<P>Until this year, 1756, I continued to re|tail goods, be&s;ides following my trade as a taylor; about which time, I grew unea&s;y on account of my bu&s;ine&s;s growing too cum|ber&s;ome. I had began with &s;elling trim|mings for garments, and from thence pro|ceeded to &s;ell cloths and linens; and, at
<PB N="46" REF="013782_0060_0F91A7A7D4F8FCF0">
length, having got a con&s;iderable &s;hop of goods, my trade increa&s;ed every year, and the road to large bu&s;ine&s;s appeared open; but I felt a &s;top in my mind.</P>
<P>Through the mercies of the Almighty, I had, in a good degree, learned to be content with a plain way of living: I had but a &s;mall family; and on &s;erious con&s;ideration, I believed truth did not require me to engage in much cumbering affairs: it had been my general practice to buy and &s;ell things really u&s;eful: things that &s;erved chiefly to plea&s;e the vain mind in people, I was not ea&s;y to trade in; &s;eldom did it; and whenever I did, I found it weaken me as a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s became my bur|then; for though my natural inclination was toward merchandize, yet I believed truth re|quired me to live more free from outward cumbers: and there was now a &s;trife in my mind between the two; and in this exerci&s;e my prayers were put up to the Lord, who graciou&s;ly heard me, and gave me a heart re|&s;igned to his holy will: then I le&s;&s;ened my outward bu&s;ine&s;s; and, as I had opportuni|ty, told my cu&s;tomers of my intentions, that they might con&s;ider what &s;hop to turn to: and, in a while, wholly laid down merchan|dize, following my trade as a taylor; my&s;elf only, having no apprentice. I al&s;o had a nur&s;ery of apple-trees; in which I employed &s;ome of my time in hoeing, grafting, trim|ming, and inoculating. In merchandi&s;e it is the cu&s;tom, where I lived, to &s;ell chiefly
<PB N="47" REF="013782_0061_0F91A7A9C39B33D8">
on credit, and poor people often get in debt; and when payment is expected, not having wherewith to pay, their creditors often &s;ue for it at law. Having often ob&s;erved occur|rences of this kind, I found it good for me to advi&s;e poor people to take &s;uch goods as were mo&s;t u&s;eful and not co&s;tly.</P>
<P>In the time of trading, I had an opportu|nity of &s;eeing, that the too liberal u&s;e of &s;pi|rituous liquors, and the cu&s;tom of wearing too co&s;tly apparel, led &s;ome people into great inconveniencies; and the&s;e two things appear to be often connected one with the other; for by not attending to that u&s;e of things which is con&s;i&s;tent with univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s, there is an increa&s;e of labour which extends beyond what our heavenly Father intends for us: and by great labour, and often by much &s;weating, there is, even among &s;uch who are not drunkards, a craving of &s;ome liquors to revive the &s;pirits: that partly by the luxuri|ous drinking of &s;ome, and partly by the drinking of others, (led to it through immo|derate labour) very great quantities of rum are every year expended in our colonies; the greater part of which we &s;hould have no need of, did we &s;teadily attend to pure wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Where men take plea&s;ure in feeling their minds elevated with &s;trong drink, and &s;o in|dulge their appetite as to di&s;order their un|der&s;tandings, neglect their duty as members in a family or civil &s;ociety, and ca&s;t off all regard to religion, their ca&s;e is much to be pitied; and where &s;uch who&s;e lives are for

the mo&s;t pa&s;t regular, and who&s;e examples have a &s;trong influence on the minds of others, adhere to &s;ome cu&s;toms which power|fully draw to the u&s;e of more &s;trong liquor than pure wi&s;dom allows; this al&s;o, as it hinders the &s;preading of the &s;pirit of meek|ne&s;s, and &s;trengthens the hands of the more exce&s;&s;ive drinkers, is a ca&s;e to be lamented.</P>
<P>As every degree of luxury hath &s;ome con|nexion with evil; for tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, and are looked upon as leaders of the people, to have that mind in them, which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t, and &s;o &s;tand &s;eparate from every wrong way, is a means of help to the weaker. As I have &s;ometimes been much &s;pent in the heat, and taken &s;pi|rits to revive me, I have found by experi|ence, that in &s;uch circum&s;tances the mind is not &s;o calm, nor &s;o fitly di&s;po&s;ed for divine meditation, as when all &s;uch extremes are avoided; and I have felt an increa&s;ing care to attend to that holy Spirit which &s;ets right bounds to our de&s;ires; and leads tho&s;e who faithfully follow it, to apply all the gifts of Divine Providence to the purpo&s;es for which they were intended. Did &s;uch who have the care of great e&s;tates, attend with &s;inglene&s;s of heart to this heavenly In&s;tructor, which &s;o opens and enlarges the mind, that men love their neighbours as them&s;elves, they would have wi&s;dom given them to manage, without finding occa&s;ion to employ &s;ome peo|ple in the luxuries of life, or to make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for others to labour too hard; but for

want of &s;teadily regarding this principle of divine love, a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit takes place in the minds of people, which is attended with darkne&s;s and manifold confu&s;ions in the world.</P>
<P>Though trading in things u&s;eful is an ho|ne&s;t employ; yet, through the great number of &s;uperfluities which are bought and &s;old, and through the corruption of the times, they who apply to merchandize for a living, have great need to be well experienced in that precept which the prophet Jeremiah laid down for his &s;cribe: <Q>Seeke&s;t thou great things for thy&s;elf? &s;eek them not.</Q></P>
<P>In the winter, this year, I was engaged with friends in vi&s;iting families; and, thro' the goodne&s;s of the Lord, we had oftentimes experience of his heart-tendering pre&s;ence among&s;t us.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE thirteenth day of the &s;econd month, in the year 1757, being then in good health, and abroad with friends vi&s;iting fa|milies, I lodged at a friend's hou&s;e, in Bur|lington; and going to bed about the time u&s;ual with me, I awoke in the night, and
<PB N="53" REF="013782_0067_0F91A7AEF0A20AF0">
my meditations, as I lay, were on the good|ne&s;s and mercy of the Lord; in a &s;en&s;e whereof my heart was contrite: after this, I went to &s;leep again; and &s;leeping a &s;hort time, I awoke; it was yet dark, and no ap|pearance of day nor moon&s;hine; and as I opened mine eyes, I &s;aw a light in my cham|ber at the apparent di&s;tance of five feet, about nine inches diameter, of a clear ea&s;y bright|ne&s;s, and near its center the mo&s;t radiant: as I lay &s;till without any &s;urprize looking upon it, words were &s;poken to my inward ear, which filled my whole inward man: they were not the effect of thought, nor any conclu&s;ion in relation to the appearance, but as the language of the Holy One &s;poken in my mind; the words were, CERTAIN EVI+DENCE OF DIVINE TRUTH; and were again repeated exactly in the &s;ame manner; where|upon the light di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Feeling the exerci&s;e in relation to a vi&s;it to the Southern Provinces to increa&s;e upon me, I acquainted our monthly-meeting therewith, and obtained their certificate: ex|pecting to go alone, one of my brothers, who lived in Philadelphia, having &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in North-Carolina, propo&s;ed going with me part of the way; but as he had a view of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e outward affairs, to accept of him as a companion &s;eemed &s;ome difficulty with me, whereupon I had conver&s;ation with him at &s;undry times; and, at length, feeling ea&s;y in my mind, I had conver&s;ation with &s;everal el|derly friends of Philadelphia on the &s;ubject;
<PB N="54" REF="013782_0068_0F91A7B23275D4D8">
and he obtaining a certificate &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, we &s;et off in the fifth month of the year 1757: and coming to Nottingham week|day meeting, lodged at John Churchman's; and here I met with our friend Benjamin Buffington, from New-England, who was re|turning from a vi&s;it to the Southern Pro|vinces. Thence we cro&s;&s;ed the river Su&s;|quehannah, and lodged at William Cox's in Maryland; and &s;oon after I entered this pro|vince, a deep and painful exerci&s;e came upon me, which I often had &s;ome feeling of &s;ince my mind was drawn toward the&s;e parts, and with which I had acquainted my brother be|fore we agreed to join as companions.</P>
<P>As the people in this and the Southern Pro|vinces live much on the labour of &s;laves, many of whom are u&s;ed hardly, my con|cern was, that I might attend with &s;inglene&s;s of heart to the voice of the true Shepherd, and be &s;o &s;upported as to remain unmoved at the faces of men.</P>
<P>As it is common for friends on &s;uch a vi|&s;it to have entertainment free of co&s;t, a dif|ficulty aro&s;e in my mind with re&s;pect to &s;aving my money by kindne&s;s received, which to me appeared to be the gain of op|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Receiving a gift, con&s;idered as a gift, brings the receiver under obligations to the benefactor, and has a natural tendency to draw the obliged into a party with the giver. To prevent difficulties of this kind, and to pre&s;erve the minds of judges from any bias,
<PB N="55" REF="013782_0069_0F91A7B338B39C18">
was that divine prohibition; <Q>Thou &s;halt not receive any gift: for a gift blindeth the wi&s;e, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</Q> Exod. xxiii. 8. As the di&s;ci|ples were &s;ent forth without any provi&s;ion for their journey, and our Lord &s;aid the work|man is worthy of his meat, their labour in the go&s;pel was con&s;idered as a reward for their entertainment, and therefore not re|ceived as a gift; yet, in regard to my pre&s;ent journey, I could not &s;ee my way clear in that re&s;pect. The difference appeared thus: The entertainment the di&s;ciples met with, was from &s;uch who&s;e hearts God had opened to receive them, from a love to them, and the truth they publi&s;hed: but we, con&s;idered as members of the &s;ame religious &s;ociety, look upon it as a piece of civility to receive each other in &s;uch vi&s;its; and &s;uch reception, at times, is partly in regard to reputation, and not from an inward unity of heart and &s;pi|rit. Conduct is more convincing than lan|guage; and where people, by their actions, manife&s;t that the &s;lave-trade is not &s;o di&s;a|greeable to their principles but that it may he encouraged, there is not a &s;ound uniting with &s;ome friends who vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of &s;o weighty a work, and be|ing &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed from many who I e&s;|teemed before my&s;elf, brought me very low; and &s;uch were the conflicts of my &s;oul, that I had a near &s;ympathy with the prophet, in the time of his weakne&s;s, when he &s;aid, <Q>If thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray

thee, if I have found favour in thy &s;ight;</Q> Numb. xi. 15. but I &s;oon &s;aw that this pro|ceeded from the want of a full re&s;ignation to the divine will. Many were the afflictions which attended me; and in great aba&s;ement, with many tears, my cries were to the Al|mighty, for his gracious and fatherly a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and then, after a time of deep trial, I was favoured to under&s;tand the &s;tate men|tioned by the p&s;almi&s;t more clearly than ever I had before; to wit: <Q>My &s;oul is even as a weaned child.</Q> P&s;alm cxxxi. 2. Being thus helped to &s;ink down into re&s;ignation, I felt a deliverance from that tempe&s;t in which I had been &s;orely exerci&s;ed, and in calmne&s;s of mind went forward, tru&s;ting that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as I faithfully attended to him, would be a councellor to me in all difficul|ties; and that by his &s;trength I &s;hould be en|abled even to leave money with the members of &s;ociety where I had entertainment, when I found that omitting of it would ob&s;truct that work to which I believed he had called me: and as I copy this after my return, I may here add, that oftentimes I did &s;o, under a &s;en&s;e of duty; the way in which I did it was thus: when I expected &s;oon to leave a friend's hou&s;e where I had entertainment, if I be|lieved that I &s;hould not keep clear from the gain of oppre&s;&s;ion without leaving money, I &s;poke to one of the heads of the family pri|vately, and de&s;ired them to accept of them pieces of &s;ilver, and give them to &s;uch of their negroes as they believed would make
<PB N="57" REF="013782_0071_0F91A7B455462EA8">
the be&s;t u&s;e of them; and at other times, I gave them to the negroes my&s;elf, as the way looked cleare&s;t to me: as I expected this be|fore I came out, I had provided a large num|ber of &s;mall pieces; and thus offering them to &s;ome who appeared to be wealthy people, was a trial both to me and them: but the fear of the Lord &s;o covered me at times, that my way was made ea&s;ier than I expected; and few, if any, manife&s;ted any re&s;entment at the offer, and mo&s;t of them, after &s;ome talk, accepted of them.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh day of the fifth month, in the year 1757, lodged at a friend's hou&s;e; and the next day, being the fir&s;t of the week, was at Potap&s;co meeting; then cro&s;&s;ed Patuxent river, and lodged at a publick-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On the ninth breakfa&s;ted at a friend's hou&s;e; who afterward, putting us a little on our way, I had conver&s;ation with him, in the fear of the Lord, concerning his &s;laves; in which my heart was tender, and I u&s;ed much plainne&s;s of &s;peech with him, which he appeared to take kindly. We pur&s;ued our journey without appointing meetings, being pre&s;&s;ed in my mind to be at the yearly-meet|ing in Virginia; and in my travelling on the road, I often felt a cry ri&s;e from the center of my mind, thus: O Lord, I am a &s;tran|ger on the earth, hide not thy face from me. On the eleventh day of the fifth month, we cro&s;&s;ed the rivers Patowmack and Rapahan|nock, and lodged at Port-Royal: and on the way we happening in company with a colo|nel

of the militia, who appeared to be a thoughtful man; I took occa&s;ion to remark on the difference in general betwixt a people u&s;ed to labour moderately for their living, training up their children in frugality and bu&s;ine&s;s, and tho&s;e who live on the labour of &s;laves; the former, in my view, being the mo&s;t happy life: with which he concurred, and mentioned the trouble ari&s;ing from the untoward, &s;lothful di&s;po&s;ition of the negroes; adding, that one of our labourers would do as much in a day as two of their &s;laves. I replied, that free men, who&s;e minds were properly on their bu&s;ine&s;s, found a &s;atisfac|tion in improving, cultivating, and providing for their families; but negroes, labouring to &s;upport others who claim them as their pro|perty, and expecting nothing but &s;lavery during life, had not the like inducement to be indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>After &s;ome further conver&s;ation, I &s;aid, that men having power, too often mi&s;ap|plied it; that though we made &s;laves of the negroes, and the Turks made &s;laves of the Chri&s;tians, I however believed that liberty was the natural right of all men equally: which he did not deny; but &s;aid, the lives of the negroes were &s;o wretched in their own country, that many of them lived better here than there: I only &s;aid, there is great odds in regard to us, on what principle we act; and &s;o the conver&s;ation on that &s;ubject ended: and I may here add, that another per&s;on, &s;ome time afterward, mentioned the wretch|edne&s;s
<PB N="59" REF="013782_0073_0F91A7B5B82083D8">
of the negroes, occa&s;ioned by their inte&s;tine wars, as an argument in favour of our fetching them away for &s;laves: to which I then replied, if compa&s;&s;ion on the Africans, in regard to their dome&s;tic troubles, were the real motives of our purcha&s;ing them, that &s;pirit of tenderne&s;s being attended to, would incite us to u&s;e them kindly; that as &s;tran|gers brought out of affliction, their lives might be happy among us; and as they are human creatures, who&s;e &s;ouls are as precious as ours, and who may receive the &s;ame help and comfort from the holy &s;criptures as we do, we could not omit &s;uitable endeavours to in&s;truct them therein: but while we mani|fe&s;t by our conduct, that our views in pur|cha&s;ing them are to advance our&s;elves; and while our buying captives taken in war, ani|mates tho&s;e parties to pu&s;h on that war, and increa&s;e de&s;olation among&s;t them; to &s;ay they live unhappy in Africa, is far from being an argument in our favour: and I further &s;aid, the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the&s;e pro|vinces to me appear difficult; that the &s;laves look like a burthen&s;ome &s;tone to &s;uch who burthen them&s;elves with them; and that if the white people retain a re&s;olution to prefer their outward pro&s;pects of gain to all other con&s;iderations, and do not act con&s;cientiou&s;|ly toward them as fellow-creatures, I believe that burthen will grow heavier and heavier, till times change in a way di&s;agreeable to us: at which the per&s;on appeared very &s;erious; and owned, that in con&s;idering their condi|tion,
<PB N="60" REF="013782_0074_0F91A7B686A7CBE0">
and the manner of their treatment in the&s;e provinces, he had &s;ometimes thought it might be ju&s;t in the Almighty &s;o to order it.</P>
<P>Having thus travelled through Maryland, we came among&s;t friends at Cedar-Creek in Virginia, on the twelfth day of the fifth month; and the next day rode, in company with &s;everal friends, a day's journey to Camp-Creek: and as I was riding along in the morning, my mind was deeply affected in a &s;en&s;e I had of the want of divine aid to &s;up|port me in the various difficulties which at|tended me; and in an uncommon di&s;tre&s;s of mind, I cried in &s;ecret to the Mo&s;t High, O Lord be merciful, I be&s;eech thee, to thy poor afflicted creature. After &s;ome time, I felt in|ward relief; and &s;oon after, a friend in com|pany began to talk in &s;upport of the &s;lave-trade, and &s;aid, the negroes were under&s;tood to be the offspring of Cain, their blackne&s;s being the mark God &s;et upon him after he murthered Abel his brother; that it was the de&s;ign of Providence they &s;hould be &s;laves, as a condition proper to the race of &s;o wick|ed a man as Cain was: then another &s;pake in &s;upport of what had been &s;aid. To all which, I replied in &s;ub&s;tance as follows: That Noah and his family were all who &s;ur|vived the flood, according to &s;cripture; and as Noah was of Seth's race, the family of Cain was wholly de&s;troyed. One of them &s;aid, that after the flood Ham went to the land of Nod, and took a wife; that Nod was a land far di&s;tant, inhabited by Cain's race,
<PB N="61" REF="013782_0075_0F91A7B757852DE0">
and that the flood did not reach it; and as Ham was &s;entenced to be a &s;ervant of &s;er|vants to his brethren, the&s;e two families be|ing thus joined, were undoubtedly fit only for &s;laves. I replied, the flood was a judg|ment upon the world for their abominations; and it was granted, that Cain's &s;tock was the mo&s;t wicked, and therefore unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e they were &s;pared: as to Ham's go|ing to the land of Nod for a wife, no time being fixed, Nod might be inhabited by &s;ome of Noah's family, before Ham married a &s;econd time; moreover the text &s;aith, <Q>That all fle&s;h died that moved upon the earth.</Q> Gen. vii. 21. I further reminded them, how the prophets repeatedly declare, <Q>that the &s;on &s;hall not &s;uffer for the iniqui|ty of the father; but every one be an|&s;werable for his own &s;ins.</Q> I was trou|bled to perceive the darkne&s;s of their imagi|nations; and in &s;ome pre&s;&s;ure of &s;pirit &s;aid, the love of ea&s;e and gain are the motives in general of keeping &s;laves, and men are wont to take hold of weak arguments to &s;upport a cau&s;e which is unrea&s;onable; and added, I have no intere&s;t on either &s;ide, &s;ave only the intere&s;t which I de&s;ire to have in the truth: and as I believe liberty is their right, and &s;ee they are not only deprived of it, but treated in other re&s;pects with inhumanity in many places, I believe He, who is a refuge for the oppre&s;&s;ed, will, in his own time, plead their cau&s;e; and happy will it be for

&s;uch, who walk in uprightne&s;s before him: and thus our conver&s;ation ended.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth day of the fifth month I was at Camp-Creek monthly-meeting, and then rode to the mountains up James-River, and had a meeting at a friend's hou&s;e; in both which I felt &s;orrow of heart, and my tears were poured out before the Lord, who was plea&s;ed to afford a degree of &s;trength by which way was opened to clear my mind among&s;t friends in tho&s;e places. From thence I went to Fork-Creek, and &s;o to Cedar-Creek again; at which place I now had a meeting; here I found a tender &s;eed: and as I was pre|&s;erved in the mini&s;try to keep low with the truth; the &s;ame truth in their hearts an&s;wer|ed it, that it was a time of mutual refre&s;h|ment from the pre&s;ence of the Lord. I lodged at James Standley's, father of William Stand|ley, one of the young men who &s;uffered im|pri&s;onment at Winche&s;ter la&s;t &s;ummer, on account of their te&s;timony again&s;t fighting; and I had &s;ome &s;atisfactory conver&s;ation with him concerning it. Hence I went to the Swamp-meeting, and to Wayanoke-meet|ing; and then cro&s;&s;ed James-River, and lodged near Burleigh. From the time of my entering Maryland I have been much under &s;orrow, which of late &s;o increa&s;ed upon me, that my mind was almo&s;t overwhelmed; and I may &s;ay with the p&s;almi&s;t, <Q>in my di&s;|tre&s;s I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God;</Q> who, in infinite goodne&s;s, looked upon my affliction, and in my pri|vate

retirement &s;ent the Comforter for my re|lief; for which I humbly ble&s;s his holy name.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e I had of the &s;tate of the churches, brought a weight of di&s;tre&s;s upon me: the gold to me appeared dim, and the fine gold changed; and though this is the ca&s;e too ge|nerally, yet the &s;en&s;e of it in the&s;e parts hath, in a particular manner, borne heavy upon me. It appeared to me, that through the prevailing of the &s;pirit of this world, the minds of many were brought to an inward de&s;olation; and in&s;tead of the &s;pirit of meek|ne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and heavenly wi&s;dom, which are the nece&s;&s;ary companions of the true &s;heep of Chri&s;t, a &s;pirit of fiercene&s;s, and the love of dominion, too generally prevailed. From &s;mall beginnings in errors, great buildings, by degrees, are rai&s;ed; and from one age to another are more and more &s;trengthened by the general concurrence of the people: and as men obtain reputation by their profe&s;&s;ion of the truth, their virtues are mentioned as arguments in favour of general error; and tho&s;e of le&s;s note, to ju&s;tify them&s;elves, &s;ay, &s;uch and &s;uch good men did the like. By what other &s;teps could the people of Judah ari&s;e to that heighth in wickedne&s;s, as to give ju&s;t ground for the prophet I&s;aiah to de|clare in the name of the Lord, <Q>that <HI>none</HI> calleth for ju&s;tice, nor <HI>any</HI> pleadeth for truth:</Q> I&s;aiah lix. 4. or for the Almighty to call upon the great city of Jeru&s;alem, ju&s;t before the Babyloni&s;h captivity, <Q>If ye can

find a man, if there be any who executeth judgment, that &s;eeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.</Q> Jer. v. 1. The pro&s;pect of a road lying open to the &s;ame degeneracy, in &s;ome parts of this newly &s;ettled land of Ame|rica, in re&s;pect to our conduct toward the negroes, hath deeply bowed my mind in this journey; and though to briefly relate how the&s;e people are treated is no agreeable work; yet, after often reading over the notes I made as I travelled, I find my mind engaged to pre&s;erve them. Many of the white people in tho&s;e provinces take little or no care of negro marriages; and when negroes marry after their own way, &s;ome make &s;o little account of tho&s;e marriages, that with views of out|ward intere&s;t, they often part men from their wives by &s;elling them far a&s;under; which is common when e&s;tates are &s;old by executors at vendue. Many who&s;e labour is heavy, being followed, at their bu&s;ine&s;s in the field, by a man with a whip, hired for that pur|po&s;e, have in common little el&s;e allowed but one peck of Indian corn and &s;ome &s;alt for one week, with a few potatoes; the potatoes they commonly rai&s;e by their labour on the fir&s;t day of the week.</P>
<P>The correction en&s;uing on their di&s;obedi|ence to over&s;eers, or &s;lothfulne&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s, is often very &s;evere, and &s;ometimes de&s;perate.</P>
<P>Men and women have many times &s;carce cloaths enough to hide their nakedne&s;s, and boys and girls, ten and twelve years old, are often quite naked among&s;t their ma&s;ter's chil|dren:

&s;ome of our &s;ociety, and &s;ome of the &s;ociety called new-lights, u&s;e &s;ome endea|vours to in&s;truct tho&s;e they have in reading; but in common this is not only neglected, but di&s;approved. The&s;e are the people by who&s;e labour the other inhabitants are in a great mea&s;ure &s;upported, and many of them in the luxuries of life: the&s;e are the people who have made no agreement to &s;erve us, and who have not forfeited their liberty that we know of: the&s;e are the &s;ouls for whom Chri&s;t died; and for our conduct toward them, we mu&s;t an&s;wer before Him who is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>They who know the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, and are thus acquainted with the merciful, benevolent, go&s;pel &s;pirit, will therein perceive that the indignation of God is kindled again&s;t oppre&s;|&s;ion and cruelty; and in beholding the great di&s;tre&s;s of &s;o numerous a people, will find cau&s;e for mourning.</P>
<P>From my lodgings I went to Burleigh meeting, where I felt my mind drawn into a quiet re&s;igned &s;tate; and after long &s;ilence, I felt an engagement to &s;tand up; and thro' the powerful operation of divine love, we were favoured with an edifying meeting. The next meeting we had was at Black-Wa|ter; and &s;o to the yearly-meeting at the We&s;tern Branch: when bu&s;ine&s;s began, &s;ome queries were con&s;idered, by &s;ome of their members, to be now produced; and if ap|proved, to be an&s;wered hereafter by their re|&s;pective

monthly-meetings. They were the Penn&s;ylvania queries, which had been exa|mined by a committee of Virginia yearly-meeting appointed the la&s;t year, who made &s;ome alterations in them; one of which alte|rations was made in favour of a cu&s;tom which troubled me. The query was, "Are there any concerned in the importation of negroes, or buying them after imported?" which they altered thus: "Are there any concerned in the importation of negroes, or buying them to trade in?" As one query ad|mitted with unanimity was, "Are any con|cerned in buying or vending goods unlaw|fully imported, or prize goods?" I found my mind engaged to &s;ay, that as we pro|fe&s;&s;ed the truth, and were there a&s;&s;embled to &s;upport the te&s;timony of it, it was nece&s;&s;ary for us to dwell deep, and act in that wi&s;dom which is pure, or otherwi&s;e we could not pro&s;per. I then mentioned their alteration; and, referring to the la&s;t mentioned query, added, as purcha&s;ing any merchandize taken by the &s;word, was always allowed to be in|con&s;i&s;tent with our principles; negroes be|ing captives of war, or taken by &s;tealth, tho&s;e circum&s;tances make it incon&s;i&s;tent with our te&s;timony to buy them; and their being our fellow-creatures, who are &s;old as &s;laves, adds greatly to the iniquity. Friends ap|peared attentive to what was &s;aid; &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ed a care and concern about their ne|groes; none made any objection, by way of reply to what I &s;aid; but the query was ad|mitted
<PB N="67" REF="013782_0081_0F91A7BE005FC3A0">
as they had altered it. As &s;ome of their members have heretofore traded in negroes, as in other merchandize, this query, be|ing admitted, will be one &s;tep further than they have hitherto gone: and I did not &s;ee it my duty to pre&s;s for an alteration; but felt ea&s;y to leave it all to Him, who alone is able to turn the hearts of the mighty, and make way for the &s;preading of truth on the earth, by means agreeable to his infinite wi&s;dom. But in regard to tho&s;e they already had, I felt my mind engaged to labour with them; and &s;aid, that, as we believe the &s;criptures were given forth by holy men, as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, and many of us know by experience that they are often help|ful and comfortable, and believe our&s;elves bound in duty to teach our children to read them, I believe, that if we were dive&s;ted of all &s;elfi&s;h views, the &s;ame good &s;pirit that gave them forth, would engage us to teach the negroes to read, that they might have the benefit of them: &s;ome there were among&s;t them who, at this time, manife&s;ted a concern in regard to taking more care in the educa|tion of their negroes.</P>
<P>On the twenty-ninth day of the fifth month, at the hou&s;e where I lodged, was a meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, at the ninth hour in the morning; at which time I found an engagement to &s;peak freely and plainly to them concerning their &s;laves; mentioning, how they, as the fir&s;t rank in the &s;ociety, who&s;e conduct in that ca&s;e was much noticed
<PB N="68" REF="013782_0082_0F91A7BEC5B1F260">
by others, were under the &s;tronger obliga|tions to look carefully to them&s;elves: expre&s;|&s;ing how needful it was for them, in that &s;i|tuation, to be thoroughly dive&s;ted of all &s;elf|i&s;h views; that living in the pure truth, and acting con&s;cientiou&s;ly toward tho&s;e people in their education and otherwi&s;e, they might be in&s;trumental in helping forward a work &s;o exceeding nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o much neglected among&s;t them. At the twelfth hour the meet|ing of wor&s;hip began; which was a &s;olid meeting.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth day, about the tenth hour, friends met to fini&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s, and then the meeting for wor&s;hip en&s;ued, which to me was a laborious time; but, through the goodne&s;s of the Lord, truth, I believe, gained &s;ome ground; and it was a &s;trengthening opportunity to the hone&s;t-hearted.</P>
<P>About this time I wrote an epi&s;tle to friends in the back &s;ettlements of North-Carolina, as follows:</P>
<P>To friends at their monthly-meeting at New-Garden and Cane-Creek, in North-Caroli|na.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT having plea&s;ed the Lord to draw me forth on a vi&s;it to &s;ome parts of Virginia and Carolina, you have often been in my mind; and though my way is not clear to
<PB N="69" REF="013782_0083_0F91A7BF6E881FE8">
come in per&s;on to vi&s;it you, yet I feel it in my heart to communicate a few things, as they ari&s;e in the love of truth: Fir&s;t, my dear friends, dwell in humility; and take heed that no views of outward gain get too deep hold of you, that &s;o your eyes being &s;ingle to the Lord, you may be pre&s;erved in the way of &s;afety. Where people let loo&s;e their minds after the love of outward things, and are more engaged in pur&s;uing the pro|fits, and &s;eeking the friend&s;hips of this world, than to be inwardly acquainted with the way of true peace; &s;uch walk in a vain &s;hadow, while the true comfort of life is wanting: their examples are often hurtful to others; and their trea&s;ures, thus collected, do many times prove dangerous &s;nares to their children.</P>
<P>But where people are &s;incerely devoted to follow Chri&s;t, and dwell under the influence of his holy &s;pirit, their &s;tability and firm|ne&s;s, through a divine ble&s;&s;ing, is at times like dew on the tender plants round about them, and the weightine&s;s of their &s;pirits &s;e|cretly works on the minds of others; and in this condition, through the &s;preading in|fluence of divine love, they feel a care over the flock; and way is opened for maintain|ing good order in the &s;ociety: and though we meet with oppo&s;ition from another &s;pirit, yet, as there is a dwelling in meekne&s;s, feel|ing our &s;pirits &s;ubject, and moving only in the gentle peaceable wi&s;dom, the inward re|ward of quietne&s;s, will be greater than all our
<PB N="70" REF="013782_0084_0F91A7C02EE47C70">
difficulties. Where the pure life is kept to, and meetings of di&s;cipline are held in the authority of it, we find by experience that they are comfortable, and tend to the health of the body.</P>
<P>While I write, the youth comes fre&s;h in my way:&mdash;Dear young people, choo&s;e God for your portion; love his truth, and be not a&s;hamed of it; choo&s;e for your company &s;uch who &s;erve him in uprightne&s;s: and &s;hun, as mo&s;t dangerous, the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who&s;e lives are of an ill favour; for by frequenting &s;uch company, &s;ome hopeful young people have come to great lo&s;s, and been drawn from le&s;s evils to greater to their utter ruin. In the bloom of youth no orna|ment is &s;o lovely as that of virtue, nor any enjoyments equal to tho&s;e which we partake of, in fully re&s;igning our&s;elves to the divine will: the&s;e enjoyments add &s;weetne&s;s to all other comforts, and give true &s;atisfaction in company and conver&s;ation, where people are mutually acquainted with it; and as your minds are thus &s;ea&s;oned with the truth, you will find &s;trength to abide &s;tedfa&s;t to the te&s;|timony of it, and be prepared for &s;ervices in the church.</P>
<P>And now, dear friends and brethren, as you are improving a wilderne&s;s, and may be numbered among&s;t the fir&s;t planters in one part of a province, I be&s;eech you, in the love of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to wi&s;ely con&s;ider the force of your examples, and think how much your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors may be thereby affected: it is a
<PB N="71" REF="013782_0085_0F91A7C100BDC220">
help in a country; yea, and a great favour and a ble&s;&s;ing, when cu&s;toms fir&s;t &s;ettled, are agreeable to &s;ound wi&s;dom: &s;o when they are otherwi&s;e, the effect of them is grievous; and children feel them&s;elves encompa&s;&s;ed with difficulties prepared for them by their prede|ce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>As moderate care and exerci&s;e, under the direction of true wi&s;dom, is u&s;eful both to mind and body; &s;o, by this means in gene|ral, the real wants of life are ea&s;ily &s;upplied: our gracious Father having &s;o proportioned one to the other, that keeping in the true medium we may pa&s;s on quietly. Where &s;laves are purcha&s;ed to do our labour, nume|rous difficulties attend it. To rational crea|tures bondage is unea&s;y, and frequently oc|ca&s;ions &s;ourne&s;s and di&s;content in them; which affects the family, and &s;uch who claim the ma&s;tery over them: and thus people and their children are many times encompa&s;&s;ed with vexations, which ari&s;e from their ap|plying to wrong methods to get a living.</P>
<P>I have been informed that there are a large number of friends in your parts, who have no &s;laves; and in tender and mo&s;t af|fectionate love, I be&s;eech you to keep clear from purcha&s;ing any. Look, my dear friends, to Divine Providence; and follow in &s;impli|city that exerci&s;e of body, that plainne&s;s and frugality, which true wi&s;dom leads to; &s;o may you be pre&s;erved from tho&s;e dangers which attend &s;uch who are aiming at out|ward ea&s;e and greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="013782_0086_0F91A7C421331988">
Trea&s;ures, though &s;mall, attained on a true principle of virtue, are &s;weet in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and while we walk in the light of the Lord, there is true comfort and &s;atisfac|tion. Here, neither the murmurs of an op|pre&s;&s;ed people, nor throbbing unea&s;y con&s;ci|ence, nor anxious thoughts about the events of things, hinder the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>When we look toward the end of life, and think on the divi&s;ion of our &s;ub&s;tance among our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; if we know that it was col|lected in the fear of the Lord, in hone&s;ty, in equity, and in uprightne&s;s of heart before him, we may con&s;ider it as his gift to us; and with a &s;ingle eye to his ble&s;&s;ing, be&s;tow it on tho&s;e we leave behind us. Such is the happine&s;s of the plain ways of true virtue. <Q>The work of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be peace; and the effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance for ever.</Q> I&s;a. xxxii. 17.</P>
<P>Dwell here, my dear friends; and then in remote and &s;olitary de&s;erts, you may find true peace and &s;atisfaction. If the Lord be our God, in truth and reality, there is &s;afe|ty for us; for he is a &s;trong hold in the day of trouble, and knoweth them that tru&s;t in him.</P>

From the yearly-meeting in Virginia, I went to Carolina; and on the fir&s;t day of the &s;ixth month, was at Wells monthly-meeting, where the &s;pring of the go&s;pel mini&s;try was opened, and the love of Je&s;us Chri&s;t experi|enced among&s;t us: to his name be the prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Here my brother joined with &s;ome friends from New-Garden, who were going home|ward; and I went next to Simons-Creek monthly-meeting, where I was &s;ilent during the meeting for wor&s;hip: and when bu&s;ine&s;s came on, my mind was exerci&s;ed concerning the poor &s;laves; but did not feel my way clear to &s;peak: in this condition I was bowed in &s;pirit before the Lord; and with tears and inward &s;upplication be&s;ought him, &s;o to open my under&s;tanding, that I might know his will concerning me; and, at length, my mind was &s;ettled in &s;ilence: near the end of their bu&s;ine&s;s, a member of their meeting expre&s;t a concern, that had &s;ome time lain upon him, on account of friends &s;o much neglecting their duty in the education of their &s;laves; and propo&s;ed having meetings &s;ometimes appointed for them on a week-day, to be only attended by &s;ome friends to be named in their monthly-meetings: many pre&s;ent appeared to unite with the propo&s;al: one &s;aid, he had often wondered that they, being our fellow-creatures and capable of re|ligious under&s;tanding, had been &s;o exceeding|ly neglected: another expre&s;&s;ed the like con|cern, and appeared zealous, that friends, in future, might more clo&s;ely con&s;ider it: at
<PB N="74" REF="013782_0088_0F91A7C630BB5780">
length a minute was made; and the further con&s;ideration of it referred to their next monthly-meeting. The friend who made this propo&s;al hath negroes: he told me, that he was at New-Garden; about two hundred and fifty miles from home, and came back alone; and that in this &s;olitary journey, this exer|ci&s;e, in regard to the education of their ne|groes, was, from time to time, renewed in his mind. A friend of &s;ome note in Virgi|nia, who hath &s;laves, told me, that he being far from home on a lone&s;ome journey, had many &s;erious thoughts about them; and that his mind was &s;o impre&s;t therewith, that he believed that he &s;aw a time coming, when Divine Providence would alter the circum|&s;tance of the&s;e people, re&s;pecting their con|dition as &s;laves.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Newbegun-Creek, and &s;at a con&s;iderable time in much weak|ne&s;s; then I felt truth open the way to &s;peak a little in much plainne&s;s and &s;implici|ty, till, at length, through the increa&s;e of divine love among&s;t us, we had a &s;ea&s;oning opportunity. From thence to the head of Little-River on a fir&s;t-day, where was a crouded meeting; and, I believe, was, thro' divine goodne&s;s, made profitable to &s;ome. Thence to the Old-Neck; where I was led into a careful &s;earching out the &s;ecret work|ings of the my&s;tery of iniquity, which, un|der a cover of religion, exalts it&s;elf again&s;t that pure &s;pirit, which leads in the way of meekne&s;s and &s;elf-denial. From thence to
<PB N="75" REF="013782_0089_0F91A7C750D26198">
Pineywoods: this was the la&s;t meeting I was at in Carolina, and was large; and my heart being deeply engaged, I was drawn forth in|to a fervent labour among&s;t them.</P>
<P>When I was at Newbegun-Creek, a friend was there who laboured for his living, hav|ing no negroes, and had been a mini&s;ter many years: he came to me the next day; and as we rode together, he &s;ignified that he wanted to talk with me concerning a difficul|ty he had been under, and related it near as follows: to wit, That as monies had of late years been rai&s;ed by a tax to carry on the wars, he had a &s;cruple in his mind in regard to paying it, and cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer di&s;traint of his goods than pay it; and as he was the only per&s;on who refu&s;ed it in tho&s;e parts, and knew not that any one el&s;e was in the like circum|&s;tances, and &s;ignified that it had been a heavy trial to him; and more &s;o, for that &s;ome of his brethren had been unea&s;y with his conduct in that ca&s;e: and added, that from a &s;ympathy he felt with me ye&s;terday in meeting, he found the freedom thus to open the matter, in the way of querying concerning friends in our parts: whereupon I told him the &s;tate of friends among&s;t us, as well as I was able; and al&s;o, that I had, for &s;ome time, been under the like &s;cruple. I believed him to be one who was concerned to walk uprightly before the Lord; and e&s;teemed it my duty to pre&s;erve this note concerning him Samuel Newby.</P>
<P>From hence I went back into Virginia, and had a meeting near James Cowpland's; it
<PB N="76" REF="013782_0090_0F91A7C7ADA41CD0">
was a time of inward &s;uffering; but, thro' the goodne&s;s of the Lord, I was made con|tent: then to another meeting; where, thro' the renewings of pure love, we had a very comfortable &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Travelling up and down of late, I have had renewed evidences, that to be faithful to the Lord, and content with his will concern|ing me, is a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful le&s;&s;on for me to be learning; looking le&s;s at the ef|fects of my labour, than at the pure motion and reality of the concern, as it ari&s;es from heavenly love. In the Lord Jehovah is ever|la&s;ting &s;trength; and as the mind, by a hum|ble re&s;ignation, is united to him, and we utter words from an inward knowledge that they ari&s;e from the heavenly &s;pring, though our way may be difficult, and require clo&s;e attention to keep in it; and though the man|ner in which we may be led may tend to our own aba&s;ement; yet, if we continue in pa|tience and meekne&s;s, heavenly peace is the re|ward of our labours.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Curles-meeting; which, though &s;mall, was reviving to the hone&s;t-hearted. Thence to Black-Creek and Caroline meetings; from whence, accompa|nied by William Standley before-mentioned, we rode to Goo&s;e-Creek, being much thro' the woods, and about one hundred miles.&mdash;We lodged, the fir&s;t night, at a publick-hou&s;e; the &s;econd, in the woods; and the next day, we reached a friend's hou&s;e, at Goo&s;e-Creek. In the woods we lay under
<PB N="77" REF="013782_0091_0F91A7C881CD0388">
&s;ome di&s;advantage, having no fireworks nor bells for our hor&s;es; but we &s;topped a little before night, and let them feed on the wild gra&s;s which was plenty; in the mean time cutting with our knives a &s;tore again&s;t night, and then tied them; and gathering &s;ome bu&s;h|es under an oak, we lay down; but the mu&s;|quetoes being plenty and the ground damp, I &s;lept but little: thus lying in the wilder|ne&s;s, and looking at the &s;tars, I was led to contemplate on the condition of our fir&s;t parents, when they were &s;ent forth from the garden; but the Almighty, though they had been di&s;obedient, continued to be a father to them; and &s;hewed them what tended to their felicity as intelligent creatures, and was ac|ceptable to him. To provide things relative to our outward living, in the way of true wi&s;dom is good; and the gift of improving in things u&s;eful, is a good gift, and comes from the Father of lights. Many have had this gift; and, from age to age, there have been improvements of this kind made in the world: but &s;ome not keeping to the pure gift, have, in the creaturely cunning and &s;elf-exaltation, &s;ought out many inventions; which inventions of men, as di&s;tinct from that uprightne&s;s in which man was created, as the fir&s;t motion to them was evil, &s;o the effects have been and are evil. That, at this day, it is as nece&s;&s;ary for us con&s;tantly to attend on the heavenly gift, to be qualified to u&s;e rightly the good things in this life amid&s;t great improvements, as it was for our
<PB N="78" REF="013782_0092_0F91A7C9429719E8">
fir&s;t parents, when they were without any improvements, without any friend or father but God only.</P>
<P>I was at a meeting at Goo&s;e-Creek; and next at a monthly-meeting at Fairfax; where, through the gracious dealing of the Almighty with us, his power prevailed over many hearts. Thence to Manoquacy and Pipe-Creek, in Maryland; at both which places I had cau&s;e humbly to adore Him, who &s;up|ported me through many exerci&s;es, and by who&s;e help I was enabled to reach the true witne&s;s in the hearts of others: there were &s;ome hopeful young people in tho&s;e parts. Thence I had meetings at John Everit's in Monalen, and at Huntingdon; and I was made humbly thankful to the Lord, who opened my heart among&s;t the people in the&s;e new &s;ettlements, &s;o that it was a time of en|couragement to the hone&s;t-minded.</P>
<P>At Monalen, a friend gave me &s;ome ac|count of a religious &s;ociety, among the Dutch, called mennoni&s;ts; and, among&s;t other things, related a pa&s;&s;age in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:&mdash;One of the mennoni&s;ts having acquaintance with a man of another &s;ociety at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance, and being with his waggon on bu&s;ine&s;s near the hou&s;e of his &s;aid acquain|tance, and night coming on, he had thoughts of putting up with him; but pa&s;&s;ing by his fields, and ob&s;erving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed appear|ance of his &s;laves, he kindled a fire in the woods hard by, and lay there that night: his &s;aid acquaintance hearing where he lodg|ed,
<PB N="79" REF="013782_0093_0F91A7CB3942EB98">
and, afterward meeting theme nnoni&s;t, told him of it; adding, he &s;hould have been heartily welcome at his hou&s;e; and from their acquaintance in former time, wondered at his conduct in that ca&s;e: the mennoni&s;t re|plied, ever &s;ince I lodged by thy field, I have wanted an opportunity to &s;peak with thee: the matter was; I intended to have come to thy hou&s;e for entertainment, but &s;eeing thy &s;laves at their work, and ob&s;erving the man|ner of their dre&s;s, I had no liking to come to partake with thee: then admoni&s;hed him to u&s;e them with more humanity; and added, as I lay by the fire that night, I thought that as I was a man of &s;ub&s;tance, thou would have received me freely; but if I had been as poor as one of thy &s;laves, and had no power to help my&s;elf, I &s;hould have received from thy hand no kinder u&s;age than they.</P>
<P>Hence I was at three meetings in my way: and &s;o I went home, under a humbling &s;en&s;e of the gracious dealings of the Lord with me, in pre&s;erving me through many trials and afflictions in my journey. I was out about two months, and travelled about ele|ven hundred and fifty miles.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A FEW years pa&s;t, money being made current in our province for carrying on wars, and to be called in again by taxes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid on the inhabitants, my mind was often af|fected with the thoughts of paying &s;uch taxes; and I believe it right for me to pre|&s;erve a memorandum concerning it: I was told, that friends in England frequently paid taxes, when the money was applied to &s;uch purpo&s;es: I had conver&s;ation with &s;everal noted friends on the &s;ubject, who all favour|ed the payment of &s;uch taxes; &s;ome of whom I preferred before my&s;elf, and this made me ea&s;ier for a time; yet there was in the deeps
<PB N="81" REF="013782_0095_0F91A7CC311C4BD0">
of my mind, a &s;cruple which I never could get over; and, at certain times, I was great|ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on that account.</P>
<P>I all along believed that there were &s;ome upright-hearted men, who paid &s;uch taxes; but could not &s;ee that their example was a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for me to do &s;o, while I be|lieved that the &s;pirit of truth required of me, as an individual, to &s;uffer patiently the di&s;tre&s;s of goods, rather than pay actively.</P>
<P>I have been informed that Thomas &agrave; Kem|pis lived and died in the profe&s;&s;ion of the Roman catholic religion: and in reading his writings, I have believed him to be a man of a true chri&s;tian &s;pirit; as fully &s;o, as many who died martyrs becau&s;e they could not join with &s;ome &s;uper&s;titions in that church.</P>
<P>All true chri&s;tians are of the &s;ame &s;pirit, but their gifts are diver&s;e; Je&s;us Chri&s;t ap|pointing to each one their peculiar office, agreeable to his infinite wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>John Hu&s;s contended again&s;t the errors crept into the church, in oppo&s;ition to the council of Con&s;tance; which the hi&s;torian reports to have con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome thou&s;and per|&s;ons. He mode&s;tly vindicated the cau&s;e which he believed was right; and though his lan|guage and conduct toward his judges appear to have been re&s;pectful, yet he never could be moved from the principles &s;ettled in his mind. To u&s;e his own words: "This I mo&s;t humbly require and de&s;ire of you all, even for His &s;ake who is the God of us all, that I be not compelled to the thing which my
<PB N="82" REF="013782_0096_0F91A7CCF8DC6198">
con&s;cience doth repugn or &s;trive again&s;t." And again, in his an&s;wer to the emperor: "I refu&s;e nothing, mo&s;t noble emperor, what&s;oever the council &s;hall decree or deter|mine upon me, only this one thing I except, that I do not offend God and my con&s;cience." Fox's Acts and Monuments, page 233. At length, rather than act contrary to that which he believed the Lord required of him, he cho&s;e to &s;uffer death by fire. Thomas &agrave; Kempis, without di&s;puting again&s;t the arti|cles then generally agreed to, appears to have laboured, by a pious example as well as by preaching and writing, to promote virtue and the inward &s;piritual religion: And I believe they were both &s;incere-hearted followers of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>True charity is an excellent virtue: and &s;incerely to labour for their good, who&s;e be|lief, in all points, doth not agree with ours, is a happy &s;tate. To refu&s;e the active pay|ment of a tax which our &s;ociety generally paid, was exceeding di&s;agreeable; but to do a thing contrary to my con&s;cience, appeared yet more dreadful. When this exerci&s;e came upon me, I knew of none under the like dif|ficulty; and, in my di&s;tre&s;s, I be&s;ought the Lord to enable me to give up all, that &s;o I might follow him where&s;oever he was plea&s;ed to lead me: and under this exerci&s;e, I went to our yearly-meeting at Philadelphia, in the year 1755; at which a committee was ap|pointed of &s;ome from each quarter, to cor|re&s;pond with the meeting for &s;ufferings in
<PB N="83" REF="013782_0097_0F91A7CDAE655990">
London, and another to vi&s;it our monthly and quarterly-meetings; and after their ap|pointment, before the la&s;t adjournment of the meeting, it was agreed in the meeting, that the&s;e two committees &s;hould meet to|gether in friends &s;chool-hou&s;e in the city, at a time then concluded on, to con&s;ider &s;ome things in which the cau&s;e of truth was concerned; and the&s;e committees meet|ing together, had a weighty conference in the fear of the Lord; at which time, I perceived, there were many friends under a &s;cruple like that before-mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tians refu&s;ed to pay taxes to &s;upport heathen tem|ples.

<P>As &s;crupling to pay a tax on account of the application, hath &s;eldom been heard of heretofore, even among&s;t men of integrity, who have &s;teadily borne their te&s;timony again&s;t outward wars in their time; I may here note &s;ome things which have occurred to my mind, as I have been inwardly exer|ci&s;ed on that account: from the &s;teady oppo|&s;ition which faithful friends, in early times, made to wrong things then approved of, they were hated and per&s;ecuted by men living in the &s;pirit of this world; and &s;uffering with firmne&s;s, they were made a ble&s;&s;ing to the church, and the work pro&s;pered. It equally concerns men, in every age, to take heed to their own &s;pirit; and in comparing their &s;itu|ation
<PB N="84" REF="013782_0098_0F91A616AEDD9AB8">
with ours, it looks to me there was le&s;s danger of their being infected with the &s;pi|rit of this world, in paying &s;uch taxes, than there is of us now: they had little or no &s;hare in civil government; and many of them de|clared, they were, through the power of God, &s;eparated from the &s;pirit in which wars were; and being afflicted by the rulers on account of their te&s;timony, there was le&s;s likelihood of uniting in &s;pirit with them in things in|con&s;i&s;tent with the purity of truth. We, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this land, have known little or no troubles of that &s;ort: their profe&s;&s;ion, for a time, was accounted re|proachful; but, at length, the uprightne&s;s of our predece&s;&s;ors being under&s;tood by the rulers, and their innocent &s;ufferings moving them, our way of wor&s;hip was tolerated; and many of our members in the&s;e colonies became active in civil government. Being thus tried with favour and pro&s;perity, this world hath appeared inviting; our minds have been turned to the improvement of our country, to merchandize and &s;ciences, among&s;t which are many things u&s;eful, being followed in pure wi&s;dom; but in our pre&s;ent condition, that a carnal mind is gaining upon us, I be|lieve will not be denied. Some of our mem|bers, who are officers in civil government, are, in one ca&s;e or other, called upon in their re&s;pective &s;tations to a&s;&s;i&s;t in things relative to the wars; &s;uch being in doubt whether to act, or crave to be excu&s;ed from their office, &s;eeing their brethren united in the payment
<PB N="85" REF="013782_0099_0F91A617027A4AE8">
of a tax to carry on the &s;aid wars, might think their ca&s;e not much different, and &s;o quench the tender movings of the Holy Spi|rit in their minds; and thus, by &s;mall degrees, there might be an approach toward that of fighting, till we came &s;o near it, as that the di&s;tinction would be little el&s;e, but the name of a peaceable people.</P>
<P>It requires great &s;elf-denial and re&s;igna|tion of our&s;elves to God, to attain that &s;tate wherein we can freely cea&s;e from fighting when wrongfully invaded; if, by our fight|ing, there were a probability of overcoming the invaders: whoever rightly attains to it, does, in &s;ome degree, feel that &s;pirit in which our Redeemer gave his life for us; and, thro' divine goodne&s;s, many of our predece&s;&s;ors, and many now living, have learned this ble&s;&s;ed le&s;&s;on; but many others, having their religion chiefly by education, and not being enough acquainted with that cro&s;s which crucifies to the world, do manife&s;t a temper di&s;tingui&s;h|able from that of an entire tru&s;t in God. In calmly con&s;idering the&s;e things, it hath not appeared &s;trange to me, that an exerci&s;e hath now fallen upon &s;ome, which, as to the out|ward means of it, is different from what was known to many of tho&s;e who went before us.</P>
<P>Some time after the yearly-meeting, a day being appointed, and letters wrote to di&s;tant members, the &s;aid committees met at Phila|delphia; and, by adjournments, continued &s;everal days. The calamities of war were now increa&s;ing; the frontier inhabitants of
<PB N="86" REF="013782_0100_0F91A617B37AD540">
Penn&s;ylvania were frequently &s;urprized, &s;ome &s;lain, and many taken captive by the Indians; and while the&s;e committees &s;at, the corps of one &s;o &s;lain was brought in a waggon, and taken through the &s;treets of the city, in his bloody garments, to alarm the people, and rou&s;e them up to war.</P>
<P>Friends thus met were not all of one mind in relation to the tax; which to &s;uch who &s;crupled it made the way more difficult. To refu&s;e an active payment at &s;uch a time, might be con&s;trued an act of di&s;loyalty, and appeared likely to di&s;plea&s;e the rulers, not only here but in England; &s;till there was a &s;cruple &s;o fa&s;tened upon the minds of many friends, that nothing moved it: it was a conference the mo&s;t weighty that ever I was at; and the hearts of many were bowed in reverence before the Mo&s;t High. Some friends of the &s;aid committees who appeared ea&s;y to pay the tax, after &s;everal adjournments, with|drew; others of them continued till the la&s;t: at length, an epi&s;tle of tender love and cau|tion, to friends in Penn&s;ylvania, was drawn by &s;ome friends concerned, on that &s;ubject; and being read &s;everal times and corrected, was then &s;igned by &s;uch of them as were free to &s;ign it, and afterward &s;ent to the monthly and quarterly-meetings.</P>
<P>On the ninth day of the eighth month, in the year 1757, at night, orders came to the military officers in our county, (Burlington) directing them to draft the militia, and pre|pare a number of men to go off as &s;oldiers,
<PB N="87" REF="013782_0101_0F91A61872045240">
to the relief of the Engli&s;h at fort William-Henry, in New-York government: a few days after which, there was a general review of the militia at Mount-Holly, and a num|ber of men cho&s;en and &s;ent off under &s;ome officers. Shortly after, there came orders to draught three times as many, to hold them|&s;elves in readine&s;s to march when fre&s;h or|ders came: and on the &s;eventeenth day of the eighth month, there was a meeting of the military officers at Mount-Holly, who agreed on a draught; and orders were &s;ent to the men &s;o cho&s;en, to meet their re&s;pective captains at &s;et times and places; tho&s;e in our town&s;hip to meet at Mount-Holly; among&s;t whom were a con&s;iderable number of our &s;ociety. My mind being affected herewith, I had fre&s;h opportunity to &s;ee and con&s;ider the advantage of living in the real &s;ub&s;tance of religion, where practice doth harmonize with principle. Among&s;t the officers are men of under&s;tanding, who have &s;ome regard to &s;incerity where they &s;ee it; and in the exe|cution of their office, when they have men to deal with whom they believe to be up|right-hearted, to put them to trouble on ac|count of &s;cruples of con&s;cience, is a painful ta&s;k, and likely to be avoided as much as ea&s;ily as may be: but where men profe&s;s to be &s;o meek and heavenly-minded, and to have their tru&s;t &s;o firmly &s;ettled in God, that they cannot join in wars; and yet, by their &s;pirit and conduct in common life, manife&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="013782_0102_0F91A619457AD118">
a contrary di&s;po&s;ition, their difficulties are great at &s;uch a time.</P>
<P>Officers in great anxiety endeavouring to get troops to an&s;wer the demands of their &s;u|periors, &s;eeing men, who are in&s;incere, pre|tend &s;cruple of con&s;cience, in hopes of be|ing excu&s;ed from a dangerous employment, they are likely to be roughly handled. In this time of commotion &s;ome of our young men left the parts, and tarried abroad till it was over; &s;ome came, and propo&s;ed to go as &s;oldiers; others appeared to have a real tender &s;cruple in their minds again&s;t joining in wars, and were much humbled under the apprehen&s;ion of a trial &s;o near: I had con|ver&s;ation with &s;everal of them to my &s;atisfac|tion. At the &s;et time when the captain came to town, &s;ome of tho&s;e la&s;t-mentioned went and told him in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:&mdash;That they could not bear arms for con&s;cience-&s;ake; nor could they hire any to go in their places, being re&s;igned as to the event of it: at length the captain acquainted them all, that they might return home for the pre&s;ent, and required them to provide them&s;elves as &s;oldiers, and to be in readine&s;s to march when called upon. This was &s;uch a time as I had not &s;een before; and yet I may &s;ay, with thankfulne&s;s to the Lord, that I believed this trial was intended for our good; and I was favoured with re&s;ignation to him. The French army taking the fort they were be&s;ieging, de|&s;troyed it and went away: the company of
<PB N="89" REF="013782_0103_0F91A619F2F13E98">
men fir&s;t draughted, after &s;ome days march, had orders to return home; and tho&s;e on the &s;econd draught, were no more called upon on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the fourth day of the fourth month, in the year 1758, orders came to &s;ome officers, in Mount-Holly, to prepare quarters, a &s;hort time, for about one hundred &s;oldiers: and an officer and two other men, all inhabitants of our town, came to my hou&s;e; and the of|ficer told me, that he came to &s;peak with me, to provide lodging and entertainment for two &s;oldiers, there being &s;ix &s;hillings a week per man allowed as pay for it. The ca&s;e being new and unexpected, I made no an&s;wer &s;ud|denly; but &s;at a time &s;ilent, my mind being inward: I was fully convinced, that the pro|ceedings in wars are incon&s;i&s;tent with the purity of the chri&s;tian religion; and to be hired to entertain men, who were then under pay as &s;oldiers, was a difficulty with me. I expected they had legal authority for what they did; and, after a &s;hort time, I &s;aid to the officer, if the men are &s;ent here for en|tertainment, I believe I &s;hall not refu&s;e to ad|mit them into my hou&s;e; but the nature of the ca&s;e is &s;uch, that I expect I cannot keep them on hire: one of the men intimated, that he thought I might do it con&s;i&s;tent with my religious principles: to which I made no reply; as believing &s;ilence, at that time, be&s;t for me. Though they &s;pake of two, there came only one, who tarried at my hou&s;e about two weeks, and behaved him&s;elf civilly; and
<PB N="90" REF="013782_0104_0F91A61AD2FE84B0">
when the officer came to pay me, I told him I could not take pay for it, having admitted him into my hou&s;e in a pa&s;&s;ive obedience to authority. I was on hor&s;eback when he &s;pake to me: and as I turned from him, he &s;aid, he was obliged to me: to which I &s;aid nothing; but thinking on the expre&s;&s;ion, I grew unea&s;y; and afterwards, being near where he lived, I went and told him on what grounds I refu&s;ed taking pay for keeping the &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Near the beginning of the year 1758, I went one evening, in company with a friend, to vi&s;it a &s;ick per&s;on; and before our re|turn, we were told of a woman living near, who, of late, had &s;everal days been di&s;con|&s;olate, occa&s;ioned by a dream; wherein death, and the judgments of the Almighty after death, were repre&s;ented to her mind in a moving manner: her &s;adne&s;s, on that ac|count, being worn off; the friend, with whom I was in company, went to &s;ee her, and had &s;ome religious conver&s;ation with her and her hu&s;band: with this vi&s;it they were &s;omewhat affected; and the man, with many tears, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction: and, in a &s;hort time after, the poor man being on the river in a &s;torm of wind, he, with one more, was drowned.</P>
<P>In the eighth month of the year 1758, having had drawings in my mind to be at the quarterly-meeting in Che&s;ter county, and at &s;ome meetings in the county of Philadel|phia, I went fir&s;t to &s;aid quarterly-meeting,
<PB N="91" REF="013782_0105_0F91A61B6E8A3AF8">
which was large; and &s;everal weighty mat|ters came under con&s;ideration and debate; and the Lord was plea&s;ed to qualify &s;ome of his &s;ervants with &s;trength and firmne&s;s, to bear the burthen of the day: though I &s;aid but little, my mind was deeply exerci&s;ed; and, under a &s;en&s;e of God's love, in the an|ointing and fitting &s;ome young men for his work, I was comforted, and my heart was tendered before him. From hence I went to the youths meeting at Darby, where my be|loved friend and brother Benjamin Jones met me, by an appointment before I left home, to join in the vi&s;it: and we were at Radnor, Merion, Richland, North-Wales, Plymouth, and Abington meetings; and had cau&s;e to bow in reverence before the Lord our graci|ous God, by who&s;e help way was opened for us from day to day. I was out about two weeks, and rode about two hundred miles.</P>
<P>The monthly-meeting of Philadelphia hav|ing been under a concern, on account of &s;ome friends, who this &s;ummer (1758) had bought negro &s;laves: the &s;aid meeting moved it to their quarterly-meeting, to have the minute recon|&s;idered in the yearly-meeting, which was made la&s;t on that &s;ubject: and the &s;aid quar|terly-meeting appointed a committee to con|&s;ider it, and report to their next; which committee having met once and adjourned, and I going to Philadelphia to meet a com|mittee of the yearly-meeting, was in town the evening on which the quarterly-meeting's
<PB N="92" REF="013782_0106_0F91A61EA0339378">
committee met the &s;econd time; and finding an inclination to &s;it with them, was, with &s;ome others, admitted; and friends had a weighty conference on the &s;ubject: and &s;oon after their next quarterly-meeting, I heard that the ca&s;e was coming to our yearly-meet|ing; which brought a weighty exerci&s;e upon me, and under a &s;en&s;e of my own infirmi|ties, and the great danger I felt of turning a&s;ide from perfect purity, my mind was of|ten drawn to retire alone, and put up my prayers to the Lord, that he would be gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;trengthen me; that &s;etting a&s;ide all views of &s;elf-intere&s;t and the friend|&s;hip of this world, I might &s;tand fully re|&s;igned to his holy will.</P>
<P>In this yearly-meeting, &s;everal weighty matters were con&s;idered; and toward the la&s;t, that in relation to dealing with per&s;ons who purcha&s;e &s;laves. During the &s;everal &s;ittings of the &s;aid meeting, my mind was frequent|ly covered with inward prayer; and I could &s;ay with David, <Q>that tears were my meat day and night.</Q> The ca&s;e of &s;lave-keeping lay heavy upon me; nor did I find any en|gagement to &s;peak directly to any other mat|ter before the meeting. Now when this ca&s;e was opened, &s;everal faithful friends &s;pake weightily thereto, with which I was com|forted; and feeling a concern to ca&s;t in my mite, I &s;aid, in &s;ub&s;tance, as follows:</P>
<P>"In the difficulties attending us in this life, nothing is more precious than the mind of truth inwardly manife&s;ted; and it is my
<PB N="93" REF="013782_0107_0F91A62090F487C8">
earne&s;t de&s;ire, that in this weighty matter, we may be &s;o truly humbled as to be favour|ed with a clear under&s;tanding of the mind of truth, and follow it; this would be of more advantage to the &s;ociety, than any me|dium not in the clearne&s;s of divine wi&s;dom. The ca&s;e is difficult to &s;ome who have them; but if &s;uch &s;et a&s;ide all &s;elf-intere&s;t, and come to be weaned from the de&s;ire of getting e&s;|tates, or even from holding them together, when truth requires the contrary, I believe way will open that they will know how to &s;teer through tho&s;e difficulties."</P>
<P>Many friends appeared to be deeply bow|ed under the weight of the work; and mani|fe&s;ted much firmne&s;s in their love to the cau&s;e of truth, and univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s on the earth: and though none did openly ju&s;tify the practice of &s;lave-keeping in general, yet &s;ome appeared concerned, le&s;t the meeting &s;hould go into &s;uch mea&s;ures, as might give unea&s;ine&s;s to many brethren; alledging, that if friends patiently continued under the ex|erci&s;e, the Lord, in time to come, might open a way for the deliverance of the&s;e peo|ple: and I finding an engagement to &s;peak, &s;aid, "My mind is often led to con&s;ider the purity of the Divine Being, and the ju&s;tice of his judgments; and herein my &s;oul is co|vered with awfulne&s;s: I cannot omit to hint of &s;ome ca&s;es, where people have not been treated with the purity of ju&s;tice, and the event hath been lamentable: Many &s;laves on this continent are oppre&s;&s;ed, and their cries
<PB N="94" REF="013782_0108_0F91A620B46256E0">
have reached the ears of the Mo&s;t High. Such are the purity and certainty of his judgments, that he cannot be partial in our favour. In infinite love and goodne&s;s, he hath opened our under&s;tandings from one time to another, concerning our duty toward this people; and it is not a time for delay. Should we now be &s;en&s;ible of what he requires of us, and through a re&s;pect to the private in|tere&s;t of &s;ome per&s;ons, or through a regard to &s;ome friend&s;hips which do not &s;tand on an immutable foundation, neglect to do our du|ty in firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy, &s;till waiting for &s;ome extraordinary means to bring about their deliverance; it may be by terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s, God may an&s;wer us in this matter."</P>
<P>Many faithful brethren laboured with great firmne&s;s; and the love of truth, in a good degree, prevailed. Several friends, who had negroes, expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire that a rule might be made, to deal with &s;uch friends as offenders who bought &s;laves in future: to this it was an&s;wered, that the root of this evil would never be effectually &s;truck at, un|til a thorough &s;earch was made into the cir|cum&s;tances of &s;uch friends who kept negroes, with re&s;pect to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of their motives in keeping them, that impartial ju&s;|tice might be admini&s;tered throughout. Seve|ral friends expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire, that a vi&s;it might be made to &s;uch friends who kept &s;laves: and many friends &s;aid, that they be|lieved

liberty was the negroes right; to which, at length, no oppo&s;ition was made publicly: a minute was made more full on that &s;ub|ject, than any heretofore; and the names of &s;everal friends entered, who were free to join in a vi&s;it to &s;uch who kept &s;laves.</P>

<P>ON the eleventh day of the eleventh month, in the year 1758, I &s;et out for Concord; the quarterly-meeting, heretofore held there, was now, by rea&s;on of a great increa&s;e of members, divided into two by the agreement of friends, at our la&s;t yearly meeting. Here
<PB N="96" REF="013782_0110_0F91A6237B91F830">
I met with our beloved friends Samuel Spa|vold and Mary Kirby from England, and with Jo&s;eph White from Bucks county, who had taken leave of his family in order to go on a religious vi&s;it to friends in England; and, through divine goodne&s;s, we were fa|voured with a &s;trengthening opportunity to|gether.</P>
<P>After this meeting I joined with my friends Daniel Stanton and John Scarborough, in vi&s;iting friends who had &s;laves; and at night we had a family meeting at William Trim|ble's, many young people being there; and it was a precious reviving opportunity. Next morning we had a comfortable &s;itting with a &s;ick neighbour; and thence to the burial of the corp&s;e of a friend at Uwchland meeting, at which were many people, and it was a time of divine favour; after which, we vi|&s;ited &s;ome who had &s;laves; and, at night, had a family meeting at a friend's hou&s;e, where the channel of go&s;pel love was opened, and my mind was comforted after a hard day's labour. The next day we were at Go|&s;hen monthly-meeting: and thence, on the eighteenth day of the eleventh month, in the year 1758, attended the quarterly-meet|ing at London-Grove, it being the fir&s;t held at that place. Here we met again with all the before-mentioned friends, and had &s;ome edi|fying meetings: and near the conclu&s;ion of the meeting for bu&s;ine&s;s, friends were incited to con&s;tancy in &s;upporting the te&s;timony of truth, and reminded of the nece&s;&s;ity which

the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t are under to attend principally to his bu&s;ine&s;s, as he is plea&s;ed to open it to us: and to be particularly care|ful to have our minds redeemed from the love of wealth; to have our outward affairs in as little room as may be; that no temporal con|cerns may entangle our affections, or hinder us from from diligently following the dictates of truth, in labouring to promote the pure &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and heavenly-mindedne&s;s among&s;t the children of men, in the&s;e days of calamity and di&s;tre&s;s; wherein God is vi|&s;iting our land with his ju&s;t judgments.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e quarterly-meetings were large, and &s;at near eight hours. Here I had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider, that it is a weighty thing to &s;peak much in large meetings for bu&s;ine&s;s: fir&s;t, except our minds are rightly prepared, and we clearly under&s;tand the ca&s;e we &s;peak to, in&s;tead of forwarding, we hinder bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and make more labour for tho&s;e on whom the burthen of the work is laid.</P>
<P>If &s;elfi&s;h views, or a partial &s;pirit, have any room in our minds, we are unfit for the Lord's work; if we have a clear pro&s;pect of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and proper weight on our minds to &s;peak, it behoves us to avoid u&s;ele&s;s apologies and repetitions: where people are gathered from far, and adjourning a meet|ing of bu&s;ine&s;s is attended with great diffi|culty, it behoves all to be cautious how they detain a meeting; e&s;pecially when they have &s;at &s;ix or &s;even hours, and have a great di&s;|tance
<PB N="98" REF="013782_0112_0F91A62497B2AA68">
to ride home. After this meeting I rode home.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the twelfth month of the year 1758, I joined in company with my friends John Sykes and Daniel Stanton, in vi&s;iting &s;uch who had &s;laves: &s;ome, who&s;e hearts were rightly exerci&s;ed about them, ap|peared to be glad of our vi&s;it; but in &s;ome places our way was more difficult; and I of|ten &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping down to that root from whence our concern proceeded; and have cau&s;e, in reverent thankfulne&s;s, humbly to bow down before the Lord, who was near to me, and pre&s;erved my mind in calmne&s;s under &s;ome &s;harp conflicts, and be|gat a &s;pirit of &s;ympathy and tenderne&s;s in me, toward &s;ome who were grievou&s;ly en|tangled by the &s;pirit of this world.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t month of the year 1759, hav|ing found my mind drawn to vi&s;it &s;ome of the more active members, in our &s;ociety at Philadelphia, who had &s;laves, I met my friend John Churchman there by an agreement; and we continued about a week in the city: we vi&s;ited &s;ome that were &s;ick, and &s;ome wi|dows and their families; and the other part of our time was mo&s;tly employed in vi&s;iting &s;uch who had &s;laves&mdash;It was a time of deep exerci&s;e, looking often to the Lord for his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; who, in un&s;peakable kindne&s;s, fa|voured us with the influence of that &s;pirit, which crucifies to the greatne&s;s and &s;plendor of this world, and enabled us to go through
<PB N="99" REF="013782_0113_0F91A6253736F2E0">
&s;ome heavy labours, in which we found peace.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth day of the third month, of this year, I was at our Gene|ral &s;pring meeting at Philadelphia: after which, I again joined with John Churchman on a vi&s;it to &s;ome more, who had &s;laves in Philadelphia; and, with thankfulne&s;s to our heavenly Father, I may &s;ay, that divine love and a true &s;ympathizing tenderne&s;s of heart, prevailed at times in this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Having, at times, perceived a &s;hyne&s;s in &s;ome friends, of con&s;iderable note, towards me, I found an engagement in go&s;pel love to pay a vi&s;it to one of them; and as I dwelt un|der the exerci&s;e, I felt a re&s;ignedne&s;s in my mind to go: &s;o I went, and told him in pri|vate, I had a de&s;ire to have an opportunity with him alone; to which he readily agreed: and then, in the fear of the Lord, things relating to that &s;hyne&s;s were &s;earched to the bottom; and we had a large conference, which, I believe, was of u&s;e to both of us; and am thankful that way was opened for it.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth day of the &s;ixth month, in the &s;ame year, having felt drawings in my mind to vi&s;it friends about Salem, and having the approbation of our monthly-meeting therein, I attended their quarterly-meeting, and was out &s;even days, and at &s;even meetings; in &s;ome of which I was chiefly &s;ilent, and in others, thro' the bap|tizing power of truth, my heart was en|larged
<PB N="100" REF="013782_0114_0F91A6260191BFA8">
in heavenly love, and found a near fellow&s;hip with the brethren and &s;i&s;ters, in the manifold trials attending their chri&s;tian progre&s;s through this world.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh month, I found an in|crea&s;ing concern on my mind to vi&s;it &s;ome active members in our &s;ociety who had &s;laves; and having no opportunity of the company of &s;uch who were named on the minutes of the yearly-meeting, I went alone to their hou&s;es, and, in the fear of the Lord, acquainted them with the exerci&s;e I was un|der: and thus, &s;ometimes, by a few words, I found my&s;elf di&s;charged from a heavy bur|then.</P>
<P>After this, our friend John Churchman coming into our province with a view to be at &s;ome meetings, and to join again in the vi&s;it to tho&s;e who had &s;laves, I bore him company in the &s;aid vi&s;it to &s;ome active mem|bers, and found inward &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>At our yearly-meeting in the year 1759, we had &s;ome weighty &s;ea&s;ons; where the power of truth was largely extended, to the &s;trengthening of the hone&s;t-minded. As friends read over the epi&s;tles, to be &s;ent to the yearly-meetings along this continent, I ob&s;erved in mo&s;t of them, both this year and la&s;t, it was recommended to friends to la|bour again&s;t buying and keeping &s;laves; and in &s;ome of them clo&s;ely treated upon. As this practice hath long been a heavy exerci&s;e to me, and I have often waded through mor|tifying labours on that account; and, at
<PB N="101" REF="013782_0115_0F91A626AEB21DE8">
times, in &s;ome meetings been almo&s;t alone therein. Now ob&s;erving the increa&s;ing con|cern in our religious &s;ociety, and &s;eeing how the Lord was rai&s;ing up and qualifying &s;er|vants for his work, not only in this re&s;pect, but for promoting the cau&s;e of truth in ge|neral, I was humbly bowed in thankfulne&s;s before him. This meeting continued near a week: and, for &s;everal days, in the forepart of it, my mind was drawn into a deep in|ward &s;tillne&s;s; and being, at times, covered with the &s;pirit of &s;upplication, my heart was &s;ecretly poured out before the Lord: and near the conclu&s;ion of the meeting for bu&s;i|ne&s;s way opened, that, in the pure flowings of divine love, I expre&s;&s;ed what lay upon me; which, as it then aro&s;e in my mind, was "fir&s;t to &s;hew how deep an&s;wers to deep in the hearts of the &s;incere and upright; though, in their different growths they may not all have attained to the &s;ame clearne&s;s in &s;ome points relating to our te&s;timony: and I was led to mention the integrity and con&s;tancy of many martyrs, who gave their lives for the te&s;ti|mony of Je&s;us; and yet, in &s;ome points, held doctrines di&s;tingui&s;hable from &s;ome which we hold: and that, in all ages where people were faithful to the light and under|&s;tanding which the Mo&s;t High afforded them, they found acceptance with him; and that now, though there are different ways of thinking among&s;t us in &s;ome particulars, yet, if we mutually kept to that &s;pirit and power which crucifies to the world, which teaches
<PB N="102" REF="013782_0116_0F91A627A886D8F0">
us to be content with things really needful, and to avoid all &s;uperfluities, giving up our hearts to fear and &s;erve the Lord, true unity may &s;till be pre&s;erved among&s;t us: and that if &s;uch, who were, at times, under &s;ufferings on account of &s;ome &s;cruples of con&s;cience, kept low and humble, and in their conduct in life manife&s;ted a &s;pirit of true charity; it would be more likely to reach the witne&s;s in others, and be of more &s;ervice in the church, than if their &s;ufferings were attend|ed with a contrary &s;pirit and conduct." In which exerci&s;e I was drawn into a &s;ympa|thizing tenderne&s;s with the &s;heep of Chri&s;t, however di&s;tingui&s;hed one from another in this world; and the like di&s;po&s;ition appeared to &s;pread over others in the meeting. Great is the goodne&s;s of the Lord toward his poor creatures.</P>
<P>An epi&s;tle went forth from this yearly-meeting, which I think good to give a place in this journal; being as follows:</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly beloved friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"IN an awful &s;en&s;e of the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of the Lord our God, who&s;e tender mercies have long been continued to us in this land, we affectionately &s;alute you, with &s;incere and fervent de&s;ires, that we may re|verently regard the di&s;pen&s;ations of his pro|vidence, and improve under them."</P>
<P>"The empires and kingdoms of the earth are &s;ubject to his Almighty power: He is the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h; and deals with his people agreeable to that wi&s;dom, the depth whereof is to us un&s;earchable: we, in the&s;e provinces, may &s;ay, He hath, as a gracious and tender parent, dealt bountifully with us, even from the days of our fathers: it was He who &s;trengthened them to labour through the difficulties attending the improvement of a wilderne&s;s, and made way for them in the hearts of the natives; &s;o that by them they were comforted in times of want and di&s;tre&s;s:
<PB N="104" REF="013782_0118_0F91A62AFAAD35B0">
it was by the gracious influences of his holy &s;pirit, that they were di&s;po&s;ed to work righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and walk uprightly one towards another, and towards the natives, and in life and conver&s;ation to manife&s;t the excellency of the principles and doctrines of the chri&s;tian religion; and thereby they retain their e&s;teem and friend&s;hip: whil&s;t they were labouring for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, many of them were fervently engaged to promote piety and vir|tue in the earth, and educate their children in the fear of the Lord."</P>
<P>"If we carefully con&s;ider the peaceable mea&s;ures pur&s;ued in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the land, and that freedom from the de&s;ola|tions of wars, which for a long time we en|joyed, we &s;hall find our&s;elves under &s;trong obligations to the Almighty, who, when the earth is &s;o generally polluted with wicked|ne&s;s, gave us a being in a part &s;o &s;ignally fa|voured with tranquillity and plenty, and in which the glad tidings of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t are &s;o freely publi&s;hed, that we may ju&s;tly &s;ay with the p&s;almi&s;t, <Q>What &s;hall we render unto the Lord for all his bene|fits?</Q></P>
<P>"Our own real good, and the good of our po&s;terity in &s;ome mea&s;ure depends on the part we act; and it nearly concerns us to try our foundations impartially. Such are the different rewards of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t in a future &s;tate, that to attend diligently to the dictates of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, to devote our|&s;elves to his &s;ervice, and engage fervently in

his cau&s;e, during our &s;hort &s;tay in this world, is a choice well becoming a free intelligent creature; we &s;hall thus clearly &s;ee and con|&s;ider that the dealings of God with mankind in a national capacity, as recorded in holy writ, do &s;ufficiently evidence the truth of that &s;aying, <Q>it is righteou&s;ne&s;s which ex|alteth a nation;</Q> and though he doth not at all times &s;uddenly execute his judgments on a &s;inful people in this life, yet we &s;ee by many in&s;tances, that where <Q>men follow lying vanities, they for&s;ake their own mer|cies;</Q> and as a proud &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit prevails and &s;preads among a people, &s;o partial judg|ment, oppre&s;&s;ion, di&s;cord, envy and confu|&s;ions increa&s;e, and provinces and kingdoms are made to drink the cup of adver&s;ity as a reward of their own doings. Thus the in|&s;pired prophet, rea&s;oning with the degene|rated Jews, &s;aith, <Q>Thine own wickedne&s;s &s;hall correct thee, and thy back&s;lidings &s;hall reprove thee: know therefore, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, &s;aith the Lord God of Ho&s;ts.</Q> Jer. ii. 19.</P>
<P>"The God of our fathers, who hath be|&s;towed on us many benefits, furni&s;hed a ta|ble for us in the wilderne&s;s, and made the de&s;arts and &s;olitary places to rejoice; he doth now mercifully call upon us to &s;erve him more faithfully&mdash;We may truly &s;ay with the prophet, <Q>it is his voice which crieth to the city, and men of wi&s;dom &s;ee his name:

They regard the rod, and him who hath appointed it</Q>.&mdash;People who look chiefly at things outward, too little con&s;ider the ori|ginal cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent troubles; but &s;uch who fear the Lord, and think often upon his name, they &s;ee and feel that a wrong &s;pirit is &s;preading among the inhabitants of our country; that the hearts of many are waxed fat, and their ears dull of hearing; that the Mo&s;t High, in his vi&s;itations to us, in&s;tead of calling, he lifteth up his voice and crieth; he crieth to our country, and his voice waxeth louder and louder. In former wars between the Engli&s;h and other nations, &s;ince the &s;ettlement of our provinces, the ca|lamities attending them have fallen chiefly on other places, but now of late they have reached to our borders; many of our fellow &s;ubjects have &s;uffered on and near our fron|tiers, &s;ome have been &s;lain in battle, &s;ome killed in their hou&s;es, and &s;ome in their fields, &s;ome wounded and left in great mi&s;ery, and others &s;eparated from their wives and little children, who have been carried captives among the Indians: We have &s;een men and women, who have been witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e &s;cenes of &s;orrow, and being reduced to want, have come to our hou&s;es a&s;king relief.&mdash;It is not long &s;ince it was the ca&s;e of many young men in one of the&s;e provinces to be draughted, in order to be taken as &s;oldiers; &s;ome where at that time in great di&s;tre&s;s, and had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider that their lives had been too little conformable to the purity and
<PB N="107" REF="013782_0121_0F91A62CCFECB8A0">
&s;pirituality of that religion which we pro|fe&s;s, and found them&s;elves too little ac|quainted with that inward humility, in which true fortitude to endure hardne&s;s for the truth's &s;ake is experienced.&mdash;Many pa|rents were concerned for their children, and in that time of trial were led to con&s;ider, that their care to get outward trea&s;ure for them, had been greater than their care for their &s;ettlement in that religion which cruci|fieth to the world, and enableth to bear a clear te&s;timony to the peaceable government of the Me&s;&s;iah. The&s;e troubles are removed, and for a time we are relea&s;ed from them."</P>
<P><Q>Let us not forget that the Mo&s;t High hath his way in the deep, in clouds and in thick darkne&s;s</Q>&mdash;that it is his voice which crieth to the city and to the country; and oh! that the&s;e loud and awakening cries, may have a proper effect upon us, that heavier cha&s;ti&s;e|ment may not become nece&s;&s;ary! For though things, as to the outward, may, for a &s;hort time, afford a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect; yet, while a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, that is not &s;ubject to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, continueth to &s;pread and prevail, there can be no long continuance in outward peace and tranquillity. If we de&s;ire an inhe|ritance incorruptible, and to be at re&s;t in that &s;tate of peace and happine&s;s, which ever con|tinues; if we de&s;ire in this life to dwell un|der the favour and protection of that al|mighty Being, who&s;e habitation is in holi|ne&s;s, who&s;e ways are all equal and who&s;e anger is now kindled, becau&s;e of our back|&s;lidings
<PB N="108" REF="013782_0122_0F91A62D6E54CB48">
let us then awfully regard the&s;e beginnings of his &s;ore judgments, and with aba&s;ement and humiliation turn to Him, whom we have offended."</P>
<P>"Contending with one equal in &s;trength, is an unea&s;y exerci&s;e; but if the Lord is be|come our enemy, if we per&s;i&s;t to contend with Him who is Omnipotent, our over|throw will be unavoidable."</P>
<P>"Do we feel an affectionate regard to po&s;te|rity; and are we employed to promote their happine&s;s? Do our minds, in things out|ward, look beyond our own di&s;&s;olution; and are we contriving for the pro&s;perity of our children after us? Let us then, like wi&s;e builders, lay the foundation deep; and by our con&s;tant uniform regard to an inward piety and virtue, let them &s;ee that we really value it: let us labour in the fear of the Lord, that their innocent minds, while young and tender, may be pre&s;erved from corrup|tions; that as they advance in age, they may rightly under&s;tand their true intere&s;t, may con&s;ider the uncertainty of temporal things, and, above all, have their hope and confidence firmly &s;ettled in the ble&s;&s;ing of that Almighty Being, who inhabits eternity, and pre&s;erves and &s;upports the world."</P>
<P>"In all our cares about worldly trea&s;ures, let us &s;teadily bear in mind, that riches po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by children, who do not truly &s;erve God, are likely to prove &s;nares that may more grievou&s;ly entangle them in that &s;pirit of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and exaltation, which &s;tands in

oppo&s;ition to real peace and happine&s;s; and renders them enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, who &s;ubmit to the influence of it."</P>
<P>"To keep a watchful eye towards real ob|jects of charity, to vi&s;it the poor in their lone&s;ome dwelling-places, to comfort them who, through the di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence, are in &s;trait and painful circum|&s;tances in this life, and &s;teadily to endeavour to honour God with our &s;ub&s;tance, from a real &s;en&s;e of the love of Chri&s;t influencing our minds thereto, is more likely to bring a ble&s;&s;ing to our children, and will afford more &s;atisfaction to a chri&s;tian favoured with plen|ty, than an earne&s;t de&s;ire to collect much wealth to leave behind us, for <Q>here we have no continuing city;</Q> may we therefore di|ligently <Q>&s;eek one that is to come, who&s;e builder and maker is God.</Q></P>

On the twenty-eighth day of the eleventh month, in the year 1759, I was at the quar|terly-meeting in Bucks county: this day be|ing the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, my heart was enlarged in the love of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the favour of the Mo&s;t High was ex|tended to us in that and the en&s;uing meet|ing.</P>
<P>I had conver&s;ation, at my lodging, with my beloved friend Samuel Ea&s;tburn; who expre&s;&s;ed a concern to join in a vi&s;it to &s;ome friends, in that county, who had negroes; and as I had felt a draught in my mind to that work in the &s;aid county, I came home and put things in order: on the eleventh day of the twelfth month following, I went over the river; and on the next day was at Buckingham meeting; where, through the de&s;cendings of heavenly dew, my mind was comforted, and drawn into a near unity with the flock of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Entering upon this vi&s;it appeared weighty: and before I left home my mind was often &s;ad; under which exerci&s;e I felt, at times, the Holy Spirit which helps our infirmities; through which, in private, my prayers were, at times, put up to God, that he would be plea&s;ed to purge me from all &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that I might be &s;trengthened to di&s;charge my duty faithfully, how hard &s;oever to the na|tural part. We proceeded on the vi&s;it in a weighty frame of &s;pirit, and went to the hou&s;es of the mo&s;t active members, through|out the county, who had negroes; and,
<PB N="111" REF="013782_0125_0F91A6315E04AD58">
through the goodne&s;s of the Lord, my mind was pre&s;erved in re&s;ignation in times of trial, and though the work was hard to nature, yet through the &s;trength of that love which is &s;tronger than death, tenderne&s;s of heart was often felt among&s;t us in our vi&s;its, and we parted from &s;everal families with greater &s;atisfaction than we expected.</P>
<P>We vi&s;ited Jo&s;eph White's family, he be|ing in England; had al&s;o a family &s;itting at the hou&s;e of an elder who bore us company, and was at Makefield on a fir&s;t day: at all which times my heart was truly thankful to the Lord, who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to re|new his loving-kindne&s;s to us, his poor &s;er|vants, uniting us together in his work.</P>
<P>In the winter of this year, the &s;mall-pox be|ing in our town, and many being inoculated, of which a few died, &s;ome things were open|ed in my mind, which I wrote as follow:</P>
<P>The more fully our lives are conformable to the will of God, the better it is for us.&mdash;I have looked on the &s;mall-pox as a me&s;&s;enger from the Almighty, to be an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the cau&s;e of virtue, and to incite us to con&s;ider whether we employ our time only in &s;uch things as are con&s;i&s;tent with perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Building hou&s;es &s;uitable to dwell in, for our&s;elves and our creatures; preparing cloath|ing &s;uitable for the climate and &s;ea&s;on, and food convenient, are all duties incumbent on us: and under the&s;e general heads, are many branches of bu&s;ine&s;s, in which we
<PB N="112" REF="013782_0126_0F91A631F5C9C680">
may venture health and life, as nece&s;&s;ity may require.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e being in a hou&s;e, and my bu&s;ine&s;s calling me to go near it, it incites me to think, whether this bu&s;ine&s;s is a real indi&s;pen&s;ible duty; whether it is not in con|formity to &s;ome cu&s;tom, which would be better laid a&s;ide; or, whether it does not proceed from too eager a pur&s;uit after &s;ome outward trea&s;ure. If the bu&s;ine&s;s before me &s;prings not from a clear under&s;tanding, and a regard to that u&s;e of things which perfect wi&s;dom approves; to be brought to a &s;en&s;e of it, and &s;topped in my pur&s;uit, is a kind|ne&s;s; for when I proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s with|out &s;ome evidence of duty, I have found, by experience, that it tends to weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>If I am &s;o &s;ituated that there appears no probability of mi&s;&s;ing the infection, it tends to make me think, whether my manner of life, in things outward, has nothing in it which may unfit my body to receive this me&s;&s;enger in a way the mo&s;t favourable to me. Do I u&s;e food and drink in no other &s;ort, and in no other degree, than was de|&s;igned by Him, who gave the&s;e creatures for our &s;u&s;tenance? Do I never abu&s;e my body by inordinate labour, &s;triving to accompli&s;h &s;ome end which I have unwi&s;ely propo&s;ed? Do I u&s;e action enough in &s;ome u&s;eful em|ploy? Or, do I &s;it too much idle, while &s;ome per&s;ons, who labour to &s;upport me, have too great a &s;hare of it? If, in any of the&s;e
<PB N="113" REF="013782_0127_0F91A632CC799E68">
things, I am deficient, to be incited to con|&s;ider it, is a favour to me.</P>
<P>There is employ nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ocial life; and this infection, which often proves mor|tal, incites me to think, whether the&s;e &s;ocial acts of mine are real duties: if I go on a vi&s;it to the widows and fatherle&s;s, do I go purely on a principle of charity, free from any &s;elfi&s;h views? If I go to a religious meeting, it puts me on thinking, whether I go in &s;incerity and in a clear &s;en&s;e of duty; or whether it is not partly in conformity to cu&s;tom, or partly from a &s;en&s;ible delight which my animal &s;pirits feel in the com|pany of other people; and whether to &s;up|port my reputation as a religious man, has no &s;hare in it.</P>
<P>Do affairs, relating to civil &s;ociety, call me near this infection? If I go, it is at the hazard of my health and life; and becomes me to think &s;eriou&s;ly, whether love to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s is the motive of my attending; whether the manner of proceeding, is alto|gether equitable; or whether aught of nar|rowne&s;s, party intere&s;t, re&s;pect to outward dignities, names, or di&s;tinctions among men, do not &s;tain the beauty of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, and render it doubtful, in point of duty, whether a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t ought to attend as a member united to the body or not.</P>
<P>Whenever there are blemi&s;hes which, for a &s;eries of time, remain &s;uch; that which is a means of &s;tirring us up to look atten|tively on the&s;e blemi&s;hes, and to labour ac|cording

to our capacities, to have health and &s;oundne&s;s re&s;tored in our country, we may ju&s;tly account a kindne&s;s from our gracious Father, who appointed that mean.</P>
<P>The care of a wi&s;e and good man for his only &s;on, is inferior to the regard of the great Parent of the univer&s;e for his creatures. He hath the command of all the powers and operations in nature; and "doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men:" cha&s;ti&s;ement is intended for in&s;truction, and in&s;truction being received by gentle cha&s;ti&s;e|ment, greater calamities are prevented.</P>
<P>By an earthquake hundreds of hou&s;es are &s;ometimes &s;haken down in a few minutes, and multitudes of people peri&s;h &s;uddenly; and many more being cru&s;hed and brui&s;ed in the ruins of the buildings, pine away and die in great mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>By the breaking in of enraged mercile&s;s armies, flouri&s;hing countries have been laid wa&s;te, and great numbers of people peri&s;hed in a &s;hort time, and many more pre&s;&s;ed with poverty and grief.</P>
<P>By the pe&s;tilence people have died &s;o fa&s;t in a city, that through fear, grief and con|fu&s;ion, tho&s;e in health have found great dif|ficulty in burying the dead, even without coffins.</P>
<P>By famine, great numbers of people, in &s;ome places, have been brought to the ut|mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and pined away for want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Thus, where the kind invitations, and gentle cha&s;ti&s;ements, of a

gracious God have not been attended to his &s;ore judgments have, at times, been poured out upon people.</P>
<P>While &s;ome rules approved in civil &s;o|ciety, and conformable to human policy, &s;o called, are di&s;tingui&s;hable from the purity of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s: while many pro|fe&s;&s;ing truth, are declining from that ardent love and heavenly mindedne&s;s, which was among&s;t the primitive followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: it is a time for us to attend diligent|ly to the intent of every cha&s;ti&s;ement, and con&s;ider the mo&s;t deep and inward de&s;ign of them.</P>
<P>The Mo&s;t High doth not often &s;peak with an outward voice to our outward ears; but, if we humbly meditate on his perfections, con&s;ider that he is perfect wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s, and to afflict his creatures to no pur|po&s;e, would be utterly rever&s;e to his nature, we &s;hall hear and under&s;tand his language, both in his gentle and more heavy cha&s;ti&s;e|ments; and take heed that we do not, in the wi&s;dom of this world, endeavour to e&s;cape his hand by means too powerful for us.</P>
<P>Had he endowed men with under&s;tanding to hinder the force of this di&s;ea&s;e by inno|cent means, which had never proved mor|tal nor hurtful to our bodies, &s;uch di&s;covery might be con&s;idered as the period of cha&s;ti&s;e|ment by this di&s;temper, where that know|ledge extended: but as life and health are his gifts, and not to be di&s;po&s;ed of in our own wills, to take upon us, when in health,

<P>HAVING, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, felt a &s;ympathy in my mind with friends Ea&s;tward, I opened my concern in our month|ly-meeting; and, obtaining a certificate, &s;et forward on the &s;eventeenth day of the fourth month, in the year 1760, joining in com|pany, by a previous agreement, with my be|loved friend Samuel Ea&s;tburn. We had meet|ings at Woodbridge, Rahaway and Plain|field; and were at their monthly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders in Rahaway. We la|boured under &s;ome di&s;couragement; but, through the invi&s;ible power of truth, our vi|&s;it was made reviving to the lowly minded, with whom I felt a near unity of &s;pirit, be|ing

much reduced in my mind. We pa&s;&s;ed on, and vi&s;ited chief of the meetings on Long-I&s;land. It was my concern, from day to day, to &s;ay no more nor le&s;s than what the &s;pirit of truth opened in me, being jea|lous over my&s;elf, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;peak any thing to make my te&s;timony look agreeable to that mind in people, which is not in pure obedience to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;pring of the mini&s;try was often low; and, through the &s;ubjecting power of truth, we were kept low with it; and from place to place, &s;uch who&s;e hearts were truly concern|ed for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, appeared to be comforted in our labours; and, though it was in general a time of aba&s;ement of the creature, yet, through His goodne&s;s, who is a helper of the poor, we had &s;ome truly edifying &s;ea&s;ons both in meetings, and in fa|milies where we tarried; and &s;ometimes found &s;trength to labour earne&s;tly with the unfaithful, e&s;pecially with tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ta|tion in families, or in the &s;ociety was &s;uch, that their example had a powerful tendency to open the way for others to go a&s;ide from the purity and &s;oundne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed truth.

<P>We cro&s;&s;ed from the ea&s;t end of Long-I&s;land to New-London, about thirty miles, in a large open boat; while we were out, the wind ri&s;ing high, the waves &s;everal times beat over us, that to me it appeared danger|ons; but my mind was, at that time, turn|ed to Him, who made and governs the deep, and my life was re&s;igned to him: and as he was mercifully plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve us, I had fre&s;h occa&s;ion to con&s;ider every day as a day lent to me; and felt a renewed engagement to devote my time, and all I had, to Him who gave it.</P>
<P>We had five meetings in Narragan&s;et; and went thence to Newport on Rhode-I&s;land.

Our gracious Father pre&s;erved us in an hum|ble dependance on him through deep exer|ci&s;es, that were mortifying to the creaturely will. In &s;everal families in the country, where we lodged, I felt an engagement on my mind to have a conference with them in private concerning their &s;laves; and, thro' divine aid, I was favoured to give up there|to: though, in this concern, I appear &s;in|gular from many, who&s;e &s;ervice in travelling, I believe, is greater than mine; I do not think hard of them for omitting it; I do not repine at having &s;o unplea&s;ant a ta&s;k a&s;|&s;igned me, but look with awfulne&s;s to Him, who appoints to his &s;ervants their re&s;pective employments, and is good to all who &s;erve him &s;incerely.</P>
<P>We got to Newport in the evening: and on the next day vi&s;ited two &s;ick per&s;ons, and had comfortable &s;ittings with them; and in the afternoon attended the burial of a friend.</P>
<P>The next day we were at meetings at Newport, in the forenoon and afternoon; where the &s;pring of the mini&s;try was opened, and &s;trength given to declare the Word of Life to the people.</P>
<P>The next day we went on our journey; but the great number of &s;laves in the&s;e parts, and the continuance of that trade from thence to Guinea, made deep impre&s;&s;ion on me; and my cries were often put up to my heavenly Father in &s;ecret, that he would enable me to di&s;charge my duty faithfully, in &s;uch way as he might be plea&s;ed to point out to me.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="013782_0135_0F91A63DC8699850">
We took Swan&s;ea, Freetown, and Tanton, in our way to Bo&s;ton; where al&s;o we had a meeting; our exerci&s;e was deep, and the love of truth prevailed, for which I ble&s;s the Lord. We went ea&s;tward about eighty miles beyond Bo&s;ton, taking meetings, and were in a good degree pre&s;erved in an humble de|pendance on that arm which drew us out; and, though we had &s;ome hard labour with the di&s;obedient, laying things home and clo&s;e to &s;uch as were &s;tout again&s;t the truth; yet, thro' the goodne&s;s of God, we had, at times, to partake of heavenly comfort with them who were meek, and were often favoured to part with friends in the nearne&s;s of true go&s;pel fel|low&s;hip. We returned to Bo&s;ton, and had another comfortable opportunity with friends there; and thence rode back a day's journey ea&s;tward of Bo&s;ton: our guide being a heavy man, and the weather hot, and my companion and I con&s;idering it, expre&s;&s;ed our freedom to go on without him, to which he con&s;ented, and we re&s;pectfully took our leave of him; this we did, as believing the journey would have been hard to him and his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>We vi&s;ited the meetings in tho&s;e parts, and were mea&s;urably baptized into a feeling of the &s;tate of the &s;ociety; and in bowedne&s;s of &s;pirit went to the yearly-meeting at New|port; where I under&s;tood that a large num|ber of &s;laves were imported from Africa into that town, and then on &s;ale by a member of our &s;ociety. At this meeting we met with John Storer from England, Elizabeth Ship|ley,
<PB N="122" REF="013782_0136_0F91A63FB3270438">
Ann Gaunt, Hannah Fo&s;ter, and Mercy Redman from our parts, all mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, of who&s;e company I was glad.</P>
<P>At this time my appetite failed, and I grew outwardly weak, and had a feeling of the condition of Habbakuk, as there ex|pre&s;&s;ed. "When I heard my belly trembled, my lips quivered, I trembled in my&s;elf that I might re&s;t in the day of trouble;" I had ma|ny cogitations, and was &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: and was de&s;irous that friends might petition the legi&s;lature, to u&s;e their endeavours to di&s;cou|rage the future importation of &s;laves; for I &s;aw that this trade was a great evil, and tended to multiply troubles, and bring di&s;|tre&s;&s;es on the people in tho&s;e parts, for who&s;e welfare my heart was deeply concerned.</P>
<P>But I perceived &s;everal difficulties in regard to petitioning; and &s;uch was the exerci&s;e of my mind, that I had thought of endeavour|ing to get an opportunity to &s;peak a few words in the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, then &s;etting in town. This exerci&s;e came upon me in the afternoon, on the &s;econd day of the yearly-meeting, and going to bed, I got no &s;leep till my mind was wholly re&s;igned therein; and in the morning I enquired of a friend how long the A&s;&s;embly were likely to conti|nue &s;itting; who told me, they were expect|ed to be prorogued that day or the next.</P>
<P>As I was de&s;irous to attend the bu&s;ine&s;s of the meeting, and perceived the A&s;&s;embly were likely to depart before the bu&s;ine&s;s was over; after con&s;iderable exerci&s;e, humbly

&s;eeking to the Lord for in&s;truction, my mind &s;ettled to attend on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the meet|ing; on the la&s;t day of which, I had pre|pared a &s;hort e&s;&s;ay of a petition to be pre|&s;ented to the legi&s;lature, if way opened: and being informed that there were &s;ome ap|pointed, by that yearly-meeting, to &s;peak with tho&s;e in authority, in ca&s;es relating to the &s;ociety, I opened my mind to &s;everal of them, and &s;hewed them the e&s;&s;ay I had made; and afterward opened the ca&s;e in the meet|ing for bu&s;ine&s;s, in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:</P>
<P>"I have been under a concern for &s;ome time, on account of the great number of &s;laves which are imported into this colony; I am aware that it is a tender point to &s;peak to, but apprehend I am not clear in the &s;ight of heaven without &s;peaking to it. I have pre|pared an e&s;&s;ay of a petition, if way open, to be pre&s;ented to the legi&s;lature; and what I have to propo&s;e to this meeting is, that &s;ome friends may be named to withdraw and look over it, and report whether they believe it &s;uitable to be read in the meeting; if they &s;hould think well of reading it, it will re|main for the meeting, after hearing it, to con&s;ider, whether to take any further notice of it as a meeting or not." After a &s;hort con|ference &s;ome friends went out, and looking over it, expre&s;&s;ed their willingne&s;s to have it read; which being done, many expre&s;&s;ed their unity with the propo&s;al; and &s;ome &s;ig|nified, that to have the &s;ubjects of the peti|tion enlarged upon, and to be &s;igned out of
<PB N="124" REF="013782_0138_0F91A640F05A8658">
meeting by &s;uch who were free, would be more &s;uitable than to do it there: though I expected at fir&s;t, that if it was done it would be in that way; yet, &s;uch was the ex|erci&s;e of my mind, that to move it in the hearing of friends when a&s;&s;embled, appeared to me as a duty; for my heart yearned to|ward the inhabitants of the&s;e parts; believ|ing that by this trade there had been an in|crea&s;e of inquietude among&s;t them, and a way made ea&s;y for the &s;preading of a &s;pirit oppo|&s;ite to that meekne&s;s and humility, which is a &s;ure re&s;ting-place for the &s;oul: and that the continuance of this trade would not only render their healing more difficult, but in|crea&s;e their malady.</P>
<P>Having thus far proceeded, I felt ea&s;y to leave the e&s;&s;ay among&s;t friends, for them to proceed in it as they believed be&s;t. And now an exerci&s;e revived on my mind in relation to lotteries, which were common in tho&s;e parts: I had once moved it in a former &s;itting of this meeting, when arguments were u&s;ed in favour of friends being held ex|cu&s;ed, who were only concerned in &s;uch lot|teries as were agreeable to law: and now on moving it again, it was oppo&s;ed as before; but the hearts of &s;ome &s;olid friends appeared to be united to di&s;courage the practice a|mong&s;t their members; and the matter was zealou&s;ly handled by &s;ome on both &s;ides. In this debate it appeared very clear to me, that the &s;pirit of lotteries was a &s;pirit of &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, which tended to confu&s;ion and dark|ne&s;s
<PB N="125" REF="013782_0139_0F91A6440369C398">
of under&s;tanding; and that pleading for it in our meetings, &s;et apart for the Lord's work, was not right: and in the heat of zeal, I once made reply to what an antient friend &s;aid, which when I &s;at down, I &s;aw that my words were not enough &s;ea&s;oned with chari|ty; and after this, I &s;pake no more on the &s;ubject. At length a minute was made; a copy of which was agreed to be &s;ent to their &s;everal quarterly-meetings, inciting friends to labour to di&s;courage the practice among&s;t all profe&s;&s;ing with us.</P>
<P>Some time after this minute was made, I remaining unea&s;y with the manner of my &s;peaking to the antient friend, could not &s;ee my way clear to conceal my unea&s;ine&s;s, but was concerned that I might &s;ay nothing to weaken the cau&s;e in which I had laboured; and then, after &s;ome clo&s;e exerci&s;e and hearty repentance, for that I had not attended clo&s;e|ly to the &s;afe guide, I &s;tood up, and reciting the pa&s;&s;age, acquainted friends, that tho' I dare not go from what I had &s;aid as to the matter, yet I was unea&s;y with the manner of my &s;peaking, as believing milder lan|guage would have been better. As this was uttered in &s;ome degree of creaturely aba&s;e|ment, it appeared to have a good &s;avor among&s;t us, after a warm debate.</P>
<P>The yearly-meeting being now over, there yet remained on my mind a &s;ecret, though heavy, exerci&s;e in regard to &s;ome leading ac|tive members about Newport, being in the practice of &s;lave-keeping. This I mentioned
<PB N="126" REF="013782_0140_0F91A644FAAD1A58">
to two antient friends, who came out of the country, and propo&s;ed to them, if way opened, to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with tho&s;e friends: and thereupon, one of tho&s;e country friends and I, con&s;ulted one of the mo&s;t noted elders who had &s;laves; and he, in a re&s;pectful manner, encouraged me to pro|ceed to clear my&s;elf of what lay upon me. Now I had, near the beginning of the yearly-meeting, a private conference with this &s;aid elder and his wife, concerning theirs; &s;o that the way &s;eemed clear to me, to advi&s;e with him about the manner of proceeding: I told him, I was free to have a conference with them all together in a private hou&s;e; or if he thought they would take it unkind to be a&s;ked to come together, and to be &s;poke with one in the hearing of another, I was free to &s;pend &s;ome time among them, and vi&s;it them all in their own hou&s;es: he expre&s;&s;ed his lik|ing to the fir&s;t propo&s;al, not doubting their willingne&s;s to come together: and as I pro|po&s;ed a vi&s;it to only mini&s;ters, elders, and over&s;eers; he named &s;ome others, whom he de&s;ired might be pre&s;ent al&s;o: and as a care|ful me&s;&s;enger was wanted to acquaint them in a proper manner, he offered to go to all their hou&s;es to open the matter to them; and did &s;o. About the eighth hour the next morning, we met in the meeting-hou&s;e cham|ber, and the la&s;t-mentioned country friend, al&s;o my companion, and John Storer with us: when, after a &s;hort time of retirement, I acquainted them with the &s;teps I had taken
<PB N="127" REF="013782_0141_0F91A646E97ACA28">
in procuring that meeting, and opened the concern I was under; and &s;o we proceeded to a free conference upon the &s;ubject. My exerci&s;e was heavy, and I was deeply bowed in &s;pirit before the Lord, who was plea&s;ed to favour with the &s;ea&s;oning virtue of truth, which wrought a tenderne&s;s among&s;t us; and the &s;ubject was mutually handled in a calm and peaceable &s;pirit: and, at length, feeling my mind relea&s;ed from that burthen which I had been under, I took my leave of them, in a good degree of &s;atisfaction; and by the tenderne&s;s they manife&s;ted in regard to the practice, and the concern &s;everal of them ex|pre&s;&s;ed in relation to the manner of di&s;po&s;ing of their negroes after their decea&s;e, I believ|ed that a good exerci&s;e was &s;preading among&s;t them; and I am humbly thankful to God, who &s;upported my mind, and pre&s;erved me in a good degree of re&s;ignation through the&s;e trials.</P>

who entertain us, on points that relate to their outward intere&s;t, is hard labour; and &s;ometimes, when I have felt truth lead to|ward it, I have found my&s;elf di&s;qualified by a &s;uperficial friend&s;hip; and as the &s;en&s;e thereof hath aba&s;ed me, and my cries have been to the Lord, &s;o I have been humbled and made content to appear weak, or as a fool for his &s;ake; and thus a door hath open|ed to enter upon it. To attempt to do the Lord's work in our own way, and to &s;peak of that which is the burthen of the word, in a way ea&s;y to the natural part, doth not reach the bottom of the di&s;order: To &s;ee the failings of our friends, and think hard of them, without opening that which we ought to open, and &s;till carry a face of friend&s;hip, this tends to undermine the foun|dation of true unity.</P>
<P>The office of a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t is weigh|ty; and they who now go forth as watch|men, had need to be &s;teadily on their guard again&s;t the &s;nares of pro&s;perity and an out|&s;ide friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>After the yearly-meeting, we were at meetings at Newtown, Cu&s;hnet, Long-Plain, Roche&s;ter and Dartmouth: from thence we &s;ailed for Nantucket, in company with Ann Gaunt and Mercy Redman, and &s;everal other friends: the wind being &s;lack, we only reached Tarpawling Cove the fir&s;t day; where, going on &s;hore, we found room in a publick-hou&s;e, and beds for a few of us, the re&s;t &s;leeping on the floor: we went on board again about
<PB N="129" REF="013782_0143_0F91A647B0DD6258">
break of day; and though the wind was &s;mall, we were favoured to come within about four miles of Nantucket; and then about ten of us getting into our boat, we rowed to the harbour before dark; whereupon a large boat going off, brought in the re&s;t of the pa&s;|&s;engers about midnight: the next day but one was their yearly-meeting, which held four days; the la&s;t of which, was their month|ly-meeting for bu&s;ine&s;s. We had a labori|ous time among&s;t them; our minds were clo&s;ely exerci&s;ed, and I believe it was a time of great &s;earching of heart: the longer I was on the i&s;land, the more I became &s;en&s;ible that there was a con&s;iderable number of va|luable friends there, though an evil &s;pirit, tending to &s;trife, had been at work among&s;t them: I was cautious of making any vi&s;its, but as my mind was particularly drawn to them; and in that way we had &s;ome &s;ittings in friends hou&s;es, where the heavenly wing was, at times, &s;pread over us, to our mutu|al comfort.</P>
<P>My beloved companion had very accepta|ble &s;ervice on this i&s;land.</P>
<P>When meeting was over, we all agreed to &s;ail the next day, if the weather was &s;uit|able and we well; and being called up the latter part of the night, we went on board a ve&s;&s;el, being in all about fifty; but the wind changing, the &s;eamen thought be&s;t to &s;tay in the harbour till it altered; &s;o we returned on &s;hore: and feeling clear as to any further vi|&s;its, I &s;pent my time in our chamber chiefly
<PB N="130" REF="013782_0144_0F91A64871F18D90">
alone; and after &s;ome hours, my heart be|ing filled with the &s;pirit of &s;upplication, my prayers and tears were poured out before my heavenly Father, for his help and in|&s;truction in the manifold difficulties which attended me in life: and while I was wait|ing upon the Lord, there came a me&s;&s;enger from the women friends, who lodged at ano|ther hou&s;e, de&s;iring to confer with us about appointing a meeting, which to me appeared weighty, as we had been at &s;o many before; but after a &s;hort conference, and advi&s;ing with &s;ome elderly friends, a meeting was appointed, in which the friend, who fir&s;t moved it, and who had been much &s;hut up before, was largely opened in the love of the go&s;pel: and the next morning, about break of day, going again on board the ve&s;&s;el, we reached Falmouth on the Main before night; where our hor&s;es being brought, we pro|ceeded toward Sandwich quarterly-meeting.</P>
<P>Being two days in going to Nantucket, and having been there once before, I ob&s;erved many &s;hoals in their bay, which make &s;ail|ing more dangerous, e&s;pecially in &s;tormy nights; al&s;o, that a great &s;hoal, which en|clo&s;es their harbour, prevents their going in with &s;loops, except when the tide is up; waiting without which, for the ri&s;ing of the tide, is &s;ometimes hazardous in &s;torms: waiting within, they &s;ometimes mi&s;s a fair wind. I took notice, that on that &s;mall i&s;land was a great number of inhabitants, and the &s;oil not very fertile; the timber &s;o
<PB N="131" REF="013782_0145_0F91A6492FBE6980">
gone, that for ve&s;&s;els, fences, and firewood, they depend chiefly on the buying from the Main the co&s;t whereof, with mo&s;t of their other expences, they depend principally upon the whale fi&s;hery to an&s;wer. I con&s;i|dered, that as towns grew larger, and lands near navigable waters more cleared, timber and wood would require more labour to get it: I under&s;tood that the whales being much hunted, and &s;ometimes wounded and not killed, grew more &s;hy and difficult to come at: I con&s;idered that the formation of the earth, the &s;eas, the i&s;lands, bays and rivers, the motions of the winds and great waters, which cau&s;e bars and &s;hoals in particular places, were all the works of Him who is perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; and as people attend to his heavenly in&s;truction, and put their tru&s;t in him, he provides for them in all parts, where he gives them a being. And as in this vi&s;it to the&s;e people, I felt a &s;trong de&s;ire for their firm e&s;tabli&s;hment on the &s;ure foundation; be&s;ides what was &s;aid more pub|lickly, I was concerned to &s;peak with the women friends, in their monthly-meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, many being pre&s;ent; and in the fre&s;h &s;pring of pure love, to open before them the advantage, both inward and out|ward, of attending &s;ingly to the pure guid|ance of the Holy Spirit, and therein to edu|cate their children in true humility, and the di&s;u&s;e of all &s;uperfluities, reminding them of the difficulties their hu&s;bands and &s;ons were frequently expo&s;ed to at &s;ea; and that the more

plain and &s;imple their way of living was, the le&s;s need of running great hazards to &s;upport them in it; encouraging the young women in their neat decent way of attending them&s;elves on the affairs of the hou&s;e; &s;hew|ing, as the way opened, that where people were truly humble, u&s;ed them&s;elves to bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and were content with a plain way of life, that it had ever been attended with more true peace and calmne&s;s of mind, than they have had who, a&s;piring to greatne&s;s and out|ward &s;hew, have gra&s;ped hard for an income to &s;upport them&s;elves in it: and as I ob|&s;erved, they had few or no &s;laves among&s;t them, I had to encourage them to be content without them; making mention of the nu|merous troubles and vexations, which fre|quently attend the minds of people, who de|pend on &s;laves to do their labour.</P>
<P>We attended the quarterly-meeting at Sandwich, in company with Ann Gaunt and Mercy Redman, which was preceeded by a monthly-meeting; and in the whole held three days: we were various ways exer|ci&s;ed among&s;t them, in go&s;pel love, accord|ing to the &s;everal gifts be&s;towed on us; and were, at times, over&s;hadowed with the virtue of truth, to the comfort of the &s;incere, and &s;tirring up of the negligent. Here we parted with Ann and Mercy, and went to Rhode-I&s;land, taking one meeting in our way, which was a &s;atisfactory time; and reaching Newport the evening before their quarterly-meeting, we attended it; and after

that, had a meeting with our young people, &s;eparated from tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties. We went thro' much labour in this town; and now, in taking leave of it, though I felt clo&s;e inward exerci&s;e to the la&s;t, I found inward peace; and was, in &s;ome degree comforted, in a belief, that a good number remain in that place, who retain a &s;en&s;e of truth; and that there are &s;ome young people at|tentive to the voice of the heavenly Shep|herd. The la&s;t meeting, in which friends from the &s;everal parts of the quarter came together, was a &s;elect meeting; and through the renewed manife&s;tation of the Father's love, the hearts of the &s;incere were united to|gether.</P>
<P>That poverty of &s;pirit and inward weak|ne&s;s, with which I was much tried the fore part of this journey, has of late appeared to me as a di&s;pen&s;ation of kindne&s;s. Appoint|ing meetings, never appeared more weighty to me; and I was led into a deep &s;earch, whether in all things my mind was re&s;igned to the will of God; often querying with my|&s;elf, what &s;hould be the cau&s;e of &s;uch inward poverty; and greatly de&s;ired, that no &s;ecret re&s;erve in my heart might hinder my acce&s;s to the divine fountain. In the&s;e humbling times I was made watchful, and excited to attend the &s;ecret movings of the heavenly principle in my mind which prepared the way to &s;ome duties, that in more ea&s;y and pro&s;perous times as to the outward, I believe I &s;hould have been in danger of omitting.</P>

From Newport we went to Greenwich, Shanticut, and Warwick; and were helped to labour among&s;t friends in the love of our gracious Redeemer: and then, accompanied by our friend John Ca&s;ey from Newport, we rode through Connecticut to Oblong, vi&s;ited the meetings of friends in tho&s;e parts, and thence proceeded to the quarterly-meeting at Ryewoods; and, thro' the gracious extend|ings of divine help, had &s;ome &s;ea&s;oning op|portunities in tho&s;e places: &s;o we vi&s;ited friends at New-York and Flu&s;hing; and thence to Rahaway: and here our roads parting, I took leave of my beloved companion and true yoke-mate Samuel Ea&s;tburn; and reached home on the tenth day of the eighth month, 1760, where I found my family well: and for the favours and protection of the Lord, both inward and outward, extended to me in this journey, my heart is humbled in grateful acknowledgements; and find re|newed de&s;ires to dwell and walk in re&s;igned|ne&s;s before him.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING felt my mind drawn toward a vi&s;it to a few meetings in Penn&s;ylva|nia, I was very de&s;irous to be rightly in|&s;tructed as to the time of &s;etting off: and on the tenth day of the fifth month, 1761, be|ing the fir&s;t day of the week, I went to Had|donfield meeting, concluding to &s;eek for hea|venly in&s;truction, and come home or go on, as I might then believe be&s;t for me; and there, thro' the &s;pringing up of pure love, I felt en|couragement, and &s;o cro&s;&s;ed the river. In this vi&s;it I was at two quarterly and three monthly-meetings; and, in the love of truth, felt my way open to labour with &s;ome noted friends, who kept negroes: and as I was favoured to keep to the root, and endeavoured to di&s;|charge what I believed was required of me, I found inward peace therein, from time to time; and thankfulne&s;s of heart to the Lord, who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to be a guide to me.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="013782_0150_0F91A650B151B798">
In the eighth month, 1761, having felt drawings in my mind to vi&s;it friends in and about Shrew&s;bury; I went there, and was at their monthly-meeting, and their fir&s;t-day meeting; and had a meeting at Squan, and another at Squankum; and, as way opened, had conver&s;ation with &s;ome noted friends concerning their &s;laves: and I returned home in a thankful &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s of the Lord.</P>
<P>From the care I felt growing in me &s;ome years, I wrote Con&s;iderations on keeping Negroes, part the &s;econd; which was print|ed this year, 1762. When the over&s;eers of the pre&s;s had done with it, they offered to get a number printed to be paid for, out of the yearly-meeting &s;tock, and to be given away; but I being mo&s;t ea&s;y to publi&s;h them at my own expence, and offering my rea&s;ons they appeared &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>This &s;tock is the contribution of the mem|bers of our religious &s;ociety in general; among&s;t whom are &s;ome who keep negroes, and being inclined to continue them in &s;la|very, are not likely to be &s;atisfied with tho&s;e books being &s;pread among&s;t a people where many of the &s;laves are taught to read, and e&s;pecially not at their expence; and &s;uch, of|ten receiving them as a gift, conceal them: But as they who make a purcha&s;e, generally buy that which they have a mind for, I be|lieved it be&s;t to &s;ell them; expecting, by that means, they would more generally be read with attention. Adverti&s;ements being &s;igned

by order of the over&s;eers of the pre&s;s, di|rected to be read in monthly-meetings of bu|&s;ine&s;s within our own yearly-meeting, in|forming where the books were, and that the price was no more than the co&s;t of printing and binding them; many were taken off in our parts; &s;ome I &s;ent to Virginia &s;ome to New-York, and &s;ome to Newport, to my ac|quaintance there; and &s;ome I kept, expect|ing to give part of them away, where there appeared a pro&s;pect of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In my youth I was u&s;ed to hard labour; and though I was middling healthy, yet my nature was not fitted to endure &s;o much as many others: that being often weary, I was prepared to &s;ympathize with tho&s;e who&s;e cir|cum&s;tances in life, as free men, required con|&s;tant labour to an&s;wer the demands of their creditors; and with others under oppre&s;&s;ion. In the unea&s;ine&s;s of body, which I have ma|ny times felt by too much labour, not as a forced but a voluntary oppre&s;&s;ion, I have of|ten been excited to think on the original cau&s;e of that oppre&s;&s;ion, which is impo&s;ed on many in the world: and the latter part of the time wherein I laboured on our planta|tion, my heart, through the fre&s;h vi&s;itations of heavenly love, being often tender; and my lei&s;ure time frequently &s;pent in reading the life and doctrines of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeem|er, the account of the &s;ufferings of martyrs, and the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t ri&s;e of our &s;ociety: a belief was gradually &s;ettled in my mind, that if &s;uch who had great e&s;tates, generally
<PB N="138" REF="013782_0152_0F91A6526D839898">
lived in that humility and plainne&s;s which belongs to a chri&s;tian life, and laid much ea&s;ier rents and intere&s;ts on their lands and monies, and thus led the way to a right u&s;e of things, &s;o great a number of people might be employed in things u&s;eful, that labour both for men and other creatures would need to be no more than an agreeable employ; and divers branches of bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;erve chiefly to plea&s;e the natural inclinations of our minds, and which, at pre&s;ent, &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary to circulate that wealth which &s;ome gather, might, in this way of pure wi&s;dom, be di&s;continued. And as I have thus con&s;ider|ed the&s;e things, a query, at times, hath ari&s;en: Do I, in all my proceedings, keep to that u&s;e of things which is agreeable to univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s? And then there hath &s;ome de|gree of &s;adne&s;s, at times, come over me; for that I accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to &s;ome things, which occa&s;ioned more labour than I believe divine wi&s;dom intends for us.</P>
<P>From my early acquaintance with truth, I have often felt an inward di&s;tre&s;s, occa&s;ion|ed by the &s;triving of a &s;pirit in me, again&s;t the operation of the heavenly principle; and in this circum&s;tance have been affected with a &s;en&s;e of my own wretchedne&s;s, and in a mourning condition felt earne&s;t longing for that divine help, which brings the &s;oul into true liberty; and &s;ometimes in this &s;tate, re|tiring into private places, the &s;pirit of &s;up|plication hath been given me; and under a heavenly covering, have a&s;ked my gracious
<PB N="139" REF="013782_0153_0F91A652EEE3F3B8">
Father, to give me a heart in all things re|&s;igned to the direction of his wi&s;dom, and in uttering language like this, the thoughts of my wearing hats and garments dyed with a dye hurtful to them, has made la&s;ting im|pre&s;&s;ions on me.</P>
<P>In vi&s;iting people of note in the &s;ociety who had &s;laves, and labouring with them in brotherly love on that account, I have &s;een, and the &s;ight has affected me, that a con|formity to &s;ome cu&s;toms, di&s;tingui&s;hable from pure wi&s;dom, has entangled many; and the de&s;ire of gain to &s;upport the&s;e cu&s;|toms, greatly oppo&s;ed the work of truth: and &s;ometimes when the pro&s;pect of the work before me has been &s;uch, that in bowedne&s;s of &s;pirit, I have been drawn into retired places, and be&s;ought the Lord with tears that he would take me wholly under his di|rection, and &s;hew me the way in which I ought to walk; it hath revived with &s;trength of conviction, that if I would be his faith|ful &s;ervant, I mu&s;t in all things attend to his wi&s;dom, and be teachable; and &s;o cea&s;e from all cu&s;toms contrary thereto, however u&s;ed among&s;t religious people.</P>
<P>As he is the perfection of power, of wi&s;|dom, and of goodne&s;s; &s;o I believe, he hath provided, that &s;o much labour &s;hall be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for men's &s;upport, in this world, as would, being rightly divided, be a &s;uitable employment of their time; and that we can|not go into &s;uperfluities, or gra&s;p after wealth in a way contrary to his wi&s;dom, without
<PB N="140" REF="013782_0154_0F91A655EE895868">
having connection with &s;ome degree of op|pre&s;&s;ion, and with that &s;pirit which leads to &s;elf-exaltation and &s;trife, and which fre|quently brings calamities on countries, by parties contending about their claims.</P>
<P>Being thus fully convinced, and feeling an increa&s;ing de&s;ire to live in the &s;pirit of peace; being often &s;orrowfully affected with the thinking on the unquiet &s;pirit in which wars are generally carried on, and with the mi&s;e|ries of many of my fellow-creatures engaged therein; &s;ome &s;uddenly de&s;troyed; &s;ome wounded, and after much pain remain crip|ples; &s;ome deprived of all their outward &s;ub|&s;tance, and reduced to want; and &s;ome car|ried into captivity. Thinking often on the&s;e things, the u&s;e of hats and garments dyed with a dye hurtful to them, and wearing more cloaths in &s;ummer than are u&s;eful, grew more unea&s;y to me; believing them to be cu&s;toms which have not their foundation in pure wi&s;dom. The apprehen&s;ion of being &s;ingular from my beloved friends, was a &s;trait upon me; and thus I remained in the u&s;e of &s;ome things contrary to my judgment.</P>
<P>On the thirty-fir&s;t day of the fifth month, 1761, I was taken ill of a fever; and, after having it near a week, I was in great di&s;tre&s;s of body: and one day there was a cry rai&s;|ed in me, that I might under&s;tand the cau&s;e why I was afflicted, and improve under it: and my conformity to &s;ome cu&s;toms, which I believed were not right, were brought to my remembrance; and in the continuation
<PB N="141" REF="013782_0155_0F91A657E37B0200">
of the exerci&s;e, I felt all the powers in me yield them&s;elves up into the hands of Him who gave me being; and was made thank|ful, that he had taken hold of me by his cha&s;ti&s;ement: feeling the nece&s;&s;ity of further purifying, there was now no de&s;ire in me for health, until the de&s;ign of my correction was an&s;wered; and thus I lay in aba&s;ement and brokenne&s;s of &s;pirit, and as I felt a &s;ink|ing down into a calm re&s;ignation, &s;o I felt, as in an in&s;tant, an inward healing in my nature; and from that time forward I grew better.</P>
<P>Though I was thus &s;ettled in mind in re|lation to hurtful dyes, I felt ea&s;y to wear my garments heretofore made; and &s;o continued about nine months. Then I thought of get|ting a hat the natural colour of the furr; but the apprehen&s;ion of being looked upon as one affecting &s;ingularity, felt unea&s;y to me: and here I had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider, that things, though &s;mall in them&s;elves, being clearly enjoined by divine authority, became great things to us; and I tru&s;ted that the Lord would &s;upport me in the trials that might attend &s;ingularity, while that &s;ingularity was only for his &s;ake: on this account, I was under clo&s;e exerci&s;e of mind in the time of our General &s;pring meeting 1762, greatly de&s;iring to be rightly directed; when being deeply bowed in &s;pirit before the Lord, I was made willing to &s;ubmit to what I appre|hended was required of me; and when I
<PB N="142" REF="013782_0156_0F91A658E97FCB68">
returned home, got a hat of the natural co|lour of the furr.</P>
<P>In attending meetings, this &s;ingularity was a trial upon me, and more e&s;pecially at this time, white hats being u&s;ed by &s;ome who were fond of following the changeable modes of dre&s;s; and as &s;ome friends, who knew not on what motives I wore it, carried &s;hy of me, I felt my way for a time &s;hut up in the exerci&s;e of the mini&s;try: and in this condition, my mind being turned toward my heavenly Father, with fervent cries that I might be pre&s;erved to walk before him in the meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, my heart was often tender in meetings; and I felt an inward con&s;olation, which to me was very precious under tho&s;e difficulties.</P>
<P>I had &s;everal dyed garments fit for u&s;e, which I believed it be&s;t to wear, till I had occa&s;ion of new ones: and &s;ome friends were apprehen|&s;ive, that my wearing &s;uch a hat favoured of an affected &s;ingularity: and &s;uch who &s;pake with me in a friendly way, I generally in|formed in a few words, that I believed my wearing it, was not in my own will. I had, at times, been &s;en&s;ible, that a &s;uperficial friend&s;hip had been dangerous to me; and many friends being now unea&s;y with me, I had an inclination to acquaint &s;ome with the manner of my being led into the&s;e things; yet, upon a deeper thought, I was for a time mo&s;t ea&s;y to omit it, believing the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation was profitable; and tru&s;ting, that
<PB N="143" REF="013782_0157_0F91A6590E8D5B68">
if I kept my place, the Lord in his own time would open the hearts of friends to|ward me: &s;ince which, I have had cau&s;e to admire his goodne&s;s and loving-kindne&s;s, in leading about and in&s;tructing, and opening and enlarging my heart in &s;ome of our meetings.</P>
<P>In the eleventh month of the year 1762, feeling an engagement of mind to vi&s;it &s;ome families in Mansfield: I joined my beloved friend Benjamin Jones, and we &s;pent a few days together in that &s;ervice. In the &s;econd month 1763, I joined in company with Eli|zabeth Smith and Mary Noble, on a vi&s;it to the families of friends at Ancocas; in both which vi&s;its, through the baptizing power of truth, the &s;incere labourers were often comforted, and the hearts of friends opened to receive us. And in the fourth month fol|lowing, I accompanied &s;ome friends in a vi|&s;it to the families of friends in Mount-Holly; in which my mind was often drawn into an inward awfulne&s;s, wherein &s;trong de&s;ires were rai&s;ed for the everla&s;ting welfare of my fellow-creatures; and, through the kindne&s;s of our heavenly Father, our hearts were, at times, enlarged, and friends invited in the flowings of divine love to attend to that which would &s;ettle them on the &s;ure foundation.</P>

we dwell; and who, for a very &s;mall con&s;i|deration, a&s;&s;igned their inheritance to us: and being at Philadelphia in the eighth month, 1761, on a vi&s;it to &s;ome friends who had &s;laves, I fell in company with &s;ome of tho&s;e natives who lived on the ea&s;t branch of the river Su&s;quehannah, at an Indian town called Wehaloo&s;ing, two hundred miles from Philadelphia; and in conver&s;ation with them by an interpreter, as al&s;o by ob&s;ervations on their countenances and conduct, I believed &s;ome of them were mea&s;urably acquainted with that divine power which &s;ubjects the rough and froward will of the creature: and, at times, I felt inward drawings to|ward a vi&s;it to that place of which I told none except my dear wife, until it came to &s;ome ripene&s;s, and then in the winter, 1762, I laid it before friends at our monthly and quarterly, and afterwards at our General &s;pring meeting; and having the unity of friends, and being thoughtful about an Indian pilot, there came a man and three women from a little beyond that town to Philadelphia on bu&s;ine&s;s: and I being informed thereof by letter, met them in town in the fifth month, 1763; and after &s;ome conver&s;ation, finding they were &s;ober people, I, by the concurrence of friends in that place, agreed to join with them as companions in their return; and on the &s;eventh day of the &s;ixth month follow|ing, we appointed to meet at Samuel Foulk's, at Richland in Bucks county. Now as this vi&s;it felt weighty, and was performed at a

time when travelling appeared perilous, &s;o the di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence, in preparing my mind for it, have been memo|rable; and I believe it good for me to give &s;ome hints thereof.</P>
<P>After I had given up to go, the thoughts of the journey were often attended with un|u&s;ual &s;adne&s;s; in which times, my heart was frequently turned to the Lord with inward breathings for his heavenly &s;upport, that I might not fail to follow him where&s;oever he might lead me: and being at our youth's meeting at Che&s;terfield, about a week before the time I expected to &s;et off, was there led to &s;peak on that prayer of our Redeemer to his Father: <Q>I pray not that thou &s;houlde&s;t take them out of the world, but that thou &s;houlde&s;t keep them from the evil.</Q> And in attending to the pure openings of truth, had to mention what He el&s;ewhere &s;aid to his Father; <Q>I know that thou heare&s;t me at all times:</Q> &s;o that, as &s;ome of his followers kept their places, and as his prayer was granted, it followed nece&s;&s;arily that they were kept from evil: and as &s;ome of tho&s;e met with great hard&s;hips and afflictions in this world, and at la&s;t &s;uffered death by cruel men; it appears, that what&s;oever befalls men while they live in pure obedience to God, as it certainly works for their good, &s;o it may not be con&s;idered an evil as it relates to them. As I &s;pake on this &s;ubject, my heart was much tendered, and great awful|ne&s;s came over me; and then, on the fir&s;t

day of the next week, being at our own af|ternoon meeting, and my heart being en|larged in love, I was led to &s;peak on the care and protection of the Lord over his people, and to make mention of that pa&s;&s;age where a band of A&s;&s;yrians endeavouring to take captive the prophet were di&s;appointed; and how the p&s;almi&s;t &s;aid, <Q>the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him.</Q> And thus, in true love and tenderne&s;s, I parted from friends, expecting the next morning to proceed on my journey; and being weary, went early to bed: and after I had been a&s;leep a &s;hort time, I was awaked by a man calling at my door; and ari&s;ing, was invited to meet &s;ome friends at a publick-hou&s;e in our town, who came from Philadelphia &s;o late, that friends were gene|rally gone to bed: the&s;e friends informed me, that an expre&s;s arrived the la&s;t morning from Pitt&s;burgh, and brought news that the Indians had taken a fort from the Engli&s;h we&s;t|ward, and &s;lain and &s;calped Engli&s;h people in divers places, &s;ome near the &s;aid Pitt&s;burgh; and that &s;ome elderly friends in Philadel|phia, knowing the time of my expecting to &s;et off, had conferred together, and thought good to inform me of the&s;e things, before I left home, that I might con&s;ider them, and proceed as I believed be&s;t; &s;o I, going again to bed, told not my wife till morning. My heart was turned to the Lord for his heaven|ly in&s;truction; and it was an humbling time

to me, When I told my dear wife, &s;he ap|peared to be deeply concerned about it; but in a few hours time, my mind became &s;et|tled in a belief, that it was my duty to pro|ceed on my journey; and &s;he bore it with a good degree of re&s;ignation. In this conflict of &s;pirit, there were great &s;earchings of heart, and &s;trong cries to the Lord, that no motion might be in the lea&s;t degree attended to, but that of the pure &s;pirit of truth.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects before-mentioned, on which I had &s;o lately &s;poke in publick, were now very fre&s;h before me; and I was brought in|wardly to commit my&s;elf to the Lord, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as he &s;aw be&s;t. So I took leave of my family and neighbours, in much bowedne&s;s of &s;pirit, and went to our month|ly-meeting at Burlington; and after taking leave of friends there, I cro&s;&s;ed the river, ac|companied by my friends I&s;rael and John Pemberton; and parting the next morning with I&s;rael, John bore me company to Sa|muel Foulk's; where I met the before-men|tioned Indians, and we were glad to &s;ee each other: here my friend Benjamin Parvin met me, and propo&s;ed joining as a companion, we having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome letters before on the &s;ubject; and now on his account I had a &s;harp trial; for as the journey appeared peri|lous, I thought if he went chiefly to bear me company, and we &s;hould be taken cap|tive, my having been the means of draw|ing him into the&s;e difficulties, would add to my own afflictions: &s;o I told him my mind

freely, and let him know that I was re&s;ign|ed to go alone; but after all, if he really be|lieved it to be his duty to go on, I believed his company would be very comfortable to me: it was indeed a time of deep exerci&s;e, and Benjamin appeared to be &s;o fa&s;tened to the vi&s;it, that he could not be ea&s;y to leave me; &s;o we went on, accompanied by our friends John Pemberton, and William Light|foot of Pikeland, and lodged at Bethlehem; and there parting with John, William and we went forward on the ninth day of the &s;ixth month, and got lodging on the floor of a hou&s;e, about five miles from Fort-Allen; here we parted with William: and at this place we met with an Indian trader, lately come from Wioming; and in conver&s;ation with him, I perceived that many white people do often &s;ell rum to the Indians, which, I believe, is a great evil; fir&s;t, they being thereby deprived of the u&s;e of their rea&s;on, and their &s;pirits vi|olently agitated, quarrels often ari&s;e which end in mi&s;chief; and the bitterne&s;s and re&s;ent|ments occa&s;ioned hereby, are frequently of long continuance: again, their &s;kins and furrs, gotten thro' much fatigue and hard tra|vels in hunting, with which they intended to buy cloathing, when they become in|toxicated, they often &s;ell at a low rate for more rum; and afterward, when they &s;uffer for want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, are an|gry with tho&s;e who, for the &s;ake of gain, took the advantage of their weakne&s;s: of this their chiefs have often complained, at

their treaties with the Engli&s;h. Where cun|ning people pa&s;s counterfeits, and impo&s;e that on others which is good for nothing, it is con&s;idered as a wickedne&s;s; but to &s;ell that to people which we know does them harm, and which often works their ruin, for the &s;ake of gain, manife&s;ts a hardened and corrupt heart; and is an evil, which de|mands the care of all true lovers of virtue to &s;uppre&s;s: and while my mind, this even|ing, was thus employed, I al&s;o remember|ed, that the people on the frontiers, among whom this evil is too common, are often poor; who venture to the out&s;ide of a colo|ny, that they may live more independant on &s;uch who are wealthy, who often &s;et high rents on their land: being renewedly con|firmed in a belief, that if all our inhabi|tants lived according to &s;ound wi&s;dom, la|bouring to promote univer&s;al love and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and cea&s;ed from every inordinate de&s;ire after wealth, and from all cu&s;toms which are tinctured with luxury, the way would be ea&s;y for our inhabitants, though much more numerous than at pre&s;ent, to live comfortably on hone&s;t employments, with|out having that temptation they are often under of being drawn into &s;chemes to make &s;ettlements on lands which have not been purcha&s;ed of the Indians, or of applying to that wicked practice of &s;elling rum to them.</P>

Lehie, near Fort-Allen; the water being high, we went over in a canoe: here we met an Indian, and had &s;ome friendly con|ver&s;ation with him, and gave him &s;ome bi&s;|cuit; and he having killed a deer, gave the Indians with us &s;ome of it: then after tra|velling &s;ome miles, we met &s;everal Indian men and women with a cow and hor&s;e, and &s;ome hou&s;hold goods, who were lately come from their dwelling at Wioming, and going to &s;ettle at another place; we made them &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents; and &s;ome of them un|der&s;tanding Engli&s;h, I told them my motive in coming into their country; with which they appeared &s;atisfied: and one of our guides talking a while with an antient wo|man concerning us, the poor old woman came to my companion and me, and took her leave of us with an appearance of &s;in|cere affection. So going on, we pitched our tent near the banks of the &s;ame river, hav|ing laboured hard in cro&s;&s;ing &s;ome of tho&s;e mountains called the Blue Ridge; and by the roughne&s;s of the &s;tones, and the cavi|ties between them, and the &s;teepne&s;s of the hills, it appeared dangerous: but we were pre&s;erved in &s;afety, through the kindne&s;s of Him who&s;e works in tho&s;e mountainous de|&s;erts appeared awful; toward whom my heart was turned during this day's travel.</P>
<P>Near our tent, on the &s;ides of large trees peeled for that purpo&s;e, were various repre|&s;entations of men going to, and returning from the wars, and of &s;ome killed in battle.

This being a path heretofore u&s;ed by warriors; and as I walked about viewing tho&s;e Indian hi&s;tories, which were painted mo&s;tly in red but &s;ome in black, and think|ing on the innumerable afflictions which the proud, fierce &s;pirit produceth in the world; thinking on the toils and fatigues of warriors, travelling over mountains and de|&s;erts; thinking on their mi&s;eries and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es when wounded far from home by their enemies; and of their brui&s;es and great wearine&s;s in cha&s;ing one another over the rocks and mountains; and of their re&s;tle&s;s, unquiet &s;tate of mind, who live in this &s;pi|rit; and of the hatred which mutually grows up in the minds of the children of tho&s;e na|tions engaged in war with each other: dur|ing the&s;e meditations, the de&s;ire to cheri&s;h the &s;pirit of love and peace among&s;t the&s;e people, aro&s;e very fre&s;h in me. This was the fir&s;t night that we lodged in the woods; and being wet with travelling in the rain, the ground, our tent, and the bu&s;hes which we purpo&s;ed to lay under our blankets al&s;o wet, all looked di&s;couraging; but I believed, that it was the Lord who had thus far brought me forward, and that he would di&s;po&s;e of me as he &s;aw good, and therein I felt ea&s;y: &s;o we kindled a fire, with our tent open to it; and with &s;ome bu&s;hes next the ground, and then our blankets, we made our bed; and lying down, got &s;ome &s;leep: and in the morning, feeling a little unwell,

I went into the river; the water was cold, but &s;oon after I felt fre&s;h and well.</P>
<P>The eleventh day of the &s;ixth month, the bu&s;hes being wet, we tarried in our tent till about eight o'clock; when going on, cro&s;&s;ed a high mountain &s;uppo&s;ed to be upward of four miles over; the &s;teepne&s;s on the north &s;ide exceeding all the others: we al&s;o cro&s;&s;ed two &s;wamps; and it raining near night, we pitched our tent and lodged.</P>
<P>About noon, on our way, we were over|taken by one of the moravian brethren, go|ing to Wehaloo&s;ing, and an Indian man with him who could talk Engli&s;h; and we being together while our hor&s;es eat gra&s;s, had &s;ome friendly conver&s;ation; but they tra|velling fa&s;ter than we, &s;oon left us. This moravian, I under&s;tood, had &s;pent &s;ome time this &s;pring at Wehaloo&s;ing; and was, by &s;ome of the Indians, invited to come again.</P>
<P>The twelfth day of the &s;ixth month, and fir&s;t of the week, it being a rainy day, we continued in our tent; and here I was led to think on the nature of the exerci&s;e which hath attended me: Love was the fir&s;t motion, and thence a concern aro&s;e to &s;pend &s;ome time with the Indians, that I might feel and un|der&s;tand their life, and the &s;pirit they live in, if haply I might receive &s;ome in&s;truction from them, or they be in any degree helped forward by my following the leadings of truth among&s;t them: and as it plea&s;ed the Lord to make way for my going at a time

<P>Our guide's hor&s;e, though hoppled, went away in the night; and after finding our own, and &s;earching &s;ome time for him, his foot&s;teps were di&s;covered in the path going back again, whereupon my kind companion went off in the rain, and after about &s;even hours returned with him: and here we lodged again; tying up our hor&s;es before we went to bed, and loo&s;ing them to feed about break of day.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth day of the &s;ixth month, the &s;un appearing, we &s;et forward; and as I rode over the barren hills, my meditations were on the alterations of the circum&s;tances of the natives of this land &s;ince the coming in of the Engli&s;h. The lands near the &s;ea, are conveniently &s;ituated for fi&s;hing; the lands near the rivers, where the tides flow, and &s;ome above, are in many places fertile, and not mountainous; while the running of the tides, makes pa&s;&s;ing up and down ea&s;y with any kind of traffick. Tho&s;e natives have, in &s;ome places, for trifling con&s;idera|tions, &s;old their inheritance &s;o favourably

&s;ituated; and in other places, been driven back by &s;uperior force: &s;o that, in many places, as their way of cloathing them&s;elves is now altered from what it was, and they, far remote from us, have to pa&s;s over moun|tains, &s;wamps, and barren de&s;arts, where travelling is very trouble&s;ome, in bringing their &s;kins and furrs to trade with us.</P>
<P>By the extending of Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, and partly by Engli&s;h hunters, the wild bea&s;ts they chiefly depend on for a &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ance, are not &s;o plenty as they were; and people too often, for the &s;ake of gain, open a door for them to wa&s;te their &s;kins and furrs, in purcha&s;ing a liquor which tends to the ruin of them and their families.</P>
<P>My own will and de&s;ires being now very much broken, and my heart, with much earne&s;tne&s;s, turned to the Lord, to whom alone I looked for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the dangers before me.

<P>Our guides took us to the hou&s;e of a very antient man; and &s;oon after we had put in our baggage, there came a man from ano|ther Indian hou&s;e &s;ome di&s;tance off; and I perceiving there was a man near the door, went out; and he having a tomahawk wrapped under his matchcoat out of &s;ight, as I approached him, he took it in his hand; I, however, went forward, and &s;peaking to him in a friendly way perceived he under|&s;tood &s;ome Engli&s;h: my companion then coming out, we had &s;ome talk with him concerning the nature of our vi&s;it in the&s;e parts; and then he going into the hou&s;e with us, and talking with our guides, &s;oon appeared friendly, and &s;at down and &s;moak|ed his pipe.

<P>Hearing the news brought by the&s;e In|dian runners, and being told by the Indians where we lodged, that what Indians were about Wioming expected, in a few days, to move to &s;ome larger towns, I thought that, to all outward appearance, it was dangerous travelling at this time; and was, after a hard day's journey, brought into a painful exerci&s;e at night, in which I had to trace back, and view over the &s;teps I had taken from my fir&s;t moving in the vi&s;it; and tho' I had to bewail &s;ome weakne&s;s which, at times, had attended me, yet I could not find that I had ever given way to a will|ful di&s;obedience: and then as I believed I had, under a &s;en&s;e of duty, come thus far, I was now earne&s;t in &s;pirit be&s;eeching the Lord to &s;hew me what I ought to do. In this great di&s;tre&s;s I grew jealous of my&s;elf, le&s;t the de&s;ire of reputation, as a man firmly &s;ettled to per&s;evere through dan|gers, or the fear of di&s;grace ari&s;ing on my returning without performing the vi|&s;it, might have &s;ome place in me: thus I lay, full of thoughts, great part of the night, while my beloved companion lay and &s;lept by me; till the Lord, my gracious Father, who &s;aw the conflicts of my &s;oul, was plea&s;ed to give quietne&s;s: then I was again &s;trengthened to commit my life, and all things relating thereto, into his heavenly

<P>On the fourteenth day of the &s;ixth month, we &s;ought out and vi&s;ited all the Indians hereabouts that we could meet with; they being chiefly in one place, about a mile from where we lodged, in all perhaps twenty. Here I expre&s;&s;ed the care I had on my mind for their good; and told them, that true love had made me willing thus to leave my family to come and &s;ee the Indians, and &s;peak with them in their hou&s;es. Some of them appeared kind and friendly. So we took our leave of the&s;e Indians: and went up the river Su&s;quehannah, about three miles, to the hou&s;e of an Indian, called Ja|cob January, who had killed his hog; and the women were making &s;tore of bread, and preparing to move up the river. Here our pilots left their canoe when they came down in the &s;pring, which, lying dry, was leaky; &s;o that we, being detained &s;ome hours, had a good deal of friendly conver&s;ation with the family; and eating dinner with them, we made them &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents. Then putting our baggage in the canoe, &s;ome of them pu&s;hed &s;lowly up the &s;tream, and the re&s;t of us rode our hor&s;es; and &s;wimming them over a creek, called Lahawahamunk, we pitched our tent a little above it, being a &s;hower in the evening: and in a &s;en&s;e of God's goodne&s;s in helping me in my di&s;tre&s;s, &s;u&s;taining me under trials, and inclining my heart to tru&s;t in him, I lay down in an

<P>On the &s;ixteenth day, we found, on our way, abundance of trees blown down with the &s;torm ye&s;terday; and had occa&s;ion reve|rently to con&s;ider the kind dealings of the Lord, who provided a &s;afe place for us in a valley, while this &s;torm continued. By the falling of abundance of trees acro&s;s our path, we were much hindered, and in &s;ome &s;wamps our way was &s;o &s;topped, that we got through with extream difficulty.</P>
<P>I had this day often to con&s;ider my&s;elf as a &s;ojourner in this world; and a belief in the all-&s;ufficiency of God to &s;upport his peo|ple in their pilgrimage felt comfortable to me; and I was indu&s;triou&s;ly employed to get to a &s;tate of perfect re&s;ignation.</P>

Job told us, that an Indian came in ha&s;te to their town ye&s;terday, and told them, that three warriors, coming from &s;ome di&s;tance, lodg|ed in a town above Wehaloo&s;ing a few nights pa&s;t; and that the&s;e three men were going again&s;t the Engli&s;h at Juniata. Job was going down the river to the province-&s;tore at Shamokin. Though I was &s;o far favour|ed with health as to continue travelling, yet through the various difficulties in our jour|ney, and the different way of living from what I had been u&s;ed to, I grew &s;ick: and the news of the&s;e warriors being on their march &s;o near us, and not knowing whe|ther we might not fall in with them, was a fre&s;h trial of my faith; and tho', thro' the &s;trength of divine love, I had &s;everal times been enabled to commit my&s;elf to the divine di&s;po&s;al, I &s;till found the want of my &s;trength to be renewed, that I might per&s;evere there|in; and my cries for help were put up to the Lord, who, in great mercy, gave me a re&s;igned heart, in which I found quietne&s;s.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth day, parting from Job Chilaway, we went on, and reached Weha|loo&s;ing about the middle of the afternoon; and the fir&s;t Indian that we &s;aw, was a wo|man of a mode&s;t countenance, with a Bible, who fir&s;t &s;pake to our guide; and then, with a harmonious voice, expre&s;&s;ed her gladne&s;s at &s;eeing us, having before heard of our coming: then, by the direction of our guide,
<PB N="161" REF="013782_0175_0F91A66F79EAACE8">
we &s;at down on a log; and he went to the town, to tell the people we were come. My companion and I &s;itting thus together, in a deep inward &s;tillne&s;s, the poor woman came and &s;at near us; and great awfulne&s;s com|ing over us, we rejoiced in a &s;en&s;e of God's love manife&s;ted to our poor &s;ouls. After a while, we heard a conk&s;hell blow &s;everal times, and then came John Curtis, and another Indian man, who kindly invited us into a hou&s;e near the town, where we found, I &s;uppo&s;e, about &s;ixty people &s;itting in &s;i|lence; and after &s;itting a &s;hort time, I &s;tood up, and in &s;ome tenderne&s;s of &s;pirit ac|quainted them with the nature of my vi&s;it, and that a concern for their good had made me willing to come thus far to &s;ee them: all in a few &s;hort &s;entences, which &s;ome of them under&s;tanding, interpreted to the others, and there appeared gladne&s;s among&s;t them. Then I &s;hewed them my certificate, which was explained to them; and the mo|ravian, who overtook us on the way, being now here, bade me welcome.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth day, we re&s;ted our&s;elves this forenoon; and the Indians knowing that the moravian and I were of different reli|gious &s;ocieties, and as &s;ome of their people had encouraged him to come and &s;tay a while with them, were, I believe, concerned, that no jarring or di&s;cord might be in their meetings: and they, I &s;uppo&s;e, having con|ferred together, acquainted me, that the people, at my reque&s;t, would, at any time,
<PB N="162" REF="013782_0176_0F91A67033C07D48">
come together, and hold meetings; and al|&s;o told me, that they expected the moravian would &s;peak in their &s;ettled meetings, which are commonly held morning and near even|ing. So I found liberty in my heart to &s;peak to the moravian, and told him of the care I felt on my mind for the good of the&s;e peo|ple; and that I believed no ill effects would follow it, if I &s;ometimes &s;pake in their meet|ings when love engaged me thereto, with|out calling them together at times when they did not meet of cour&s;e: whereupon he ex|pre&s;&s;ed his good-will toward my &s;peaking at any time, all that I found in my heart to &s;ay: &s;o near evening I was at their meet|ing, where the pure go&s;pel love was felt, to the tendering &s;ome of our hearts; and the interpreters endeavouring to acquaint the people with what I &s;aid, in &s;hort &s;entences, found &s;ome difficulty, as none of them were quite perfect in the Engli&s;h and Delaware tongues, &s;o they helped one another, and we laboured along, divine love attending: and afterwards feeling my mind covered with the &s;pirit of prayer, I told the interpreters that I found it in my heart to pray to God, and believed, if I prayed aright, he would hear me, and expre&s;&s;ed my willingne&s;s for them to omit interpreting; &s;o our meeting ended with a degree of divine love: and before the people went out, I ob&s;erved Pa|punehang (the man who had been zealous in labouring for a reformation in that town, being then very tender) &s;poke to one of the
<PB N="163" REF="013782_0177_0F91A67103E86590">
interpreters: and I was afterwards told that he &s;aid in &s;ub&s;tance as follows; "I love to feel where words come from."</P>
<P>On the nineteenth day, and fir&s;t of the week, this morning in the meeting the In|dian who came with the moravian, being al|&s;o a member of that &s;ociety, prayed; and then the moravian &s;pake a &s;hort time to the people: and in the afternoon, they coming together, and my heart being filled with a heavenly care for their good, I &s;pake to them awhile by interpreters; but none of them being perfect in the work, and I feeling the current of love run &s;trong, told the inter|preters, that I believed &s;ome of the people would under&s;tand me, and &s;o I proceeded: in which exerci&s;e, I believe the Holy Gho&s;t wrought on &s;ome hearts to edification, where all the words were not under&s;tood. I look|ed upon it as a time of divine favour, and my heart was tendered and truly thankful before the Lord; and after I &s;at down, one of the interpreters &s;eemed &s;pirited to give the Indians the &s;ub&s;tance of what I had &s;aid.</P>
<P>Before our fir&s;t meeting this morning, I was led to meditate on the manifold diffi|culties of the&s;e Indians, who, by the per|mi&s;&s;ion of the Six Nations, dwell in the&s;e parts; and a near &s;ympathy with them was rai&s;ed in me; and my heart being enlarged in the love of Chri&s;t, I thought that the af|fectionate care of a good man for his only brother in affliction, does not exceed what I then felt for that people.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="013782_0178_0F91A671AEE9C7E8">
I came to this place through much trou|ble; and though, through the mercies of God, I believed, that if I died in the jour|ney, it would be well with me; yet the thoughts of falling into the hands of Indian warriors, were, in times of weakne&s;s, afflict|ing to me; and being of a tender con&s;titu|tion of body, the thoughts of captivity among&s;t them were, at times, grievous; as &s;uppo&s;ing, that they being &s;trong and hardy, might demand &s;ervice of me beyond what I could well bear; but the Lord alone was my keeper; and I believed, if I went into capti|vity, it would be for &s;ome good end; and thus, from time to time, my mind was cen|tered in re&s;ignation, in which I always found quietne&s;s. And now, this day, though I had the &s;ame dangerous wilderne&s;s between me and home, I was inwardly joyful that the Lord had &s;trengthened me to come on this vi&s;it, and manife&s;ted a fatherly care over me in my poor lowly condition, when in mine own eyes I appeared inferior to many a|mong&s;t the Indians.</P>
<P>When the la&s;t mentioned meeting was ended, it being night Papunehang went to bed; and one of the interpreters &s;itting by me, I ob&s;erved Papunehang &s;poke with an harmonious voice, I &s;uppo&s;e, a minute or two: and a&s;king the interpreter, was told, that "he was expre&s;&s;ing his thankfulne&s;s to God for the favours he had received that day; and prayed that he would continue to favour him with that &s;ame, which he had
<PB N="165" REF="013782_0179_0F91A67293A07D88">
experienced in that meeting." That though Papunehang had before agreed to receive the moravian, and join with them, he &s;till ap|peared kind and loving to us.</P>
<P>On the twentieth day, I was at two meet|ings, and &s;ilent in them.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t day. This morning in meeting my heart was enlarged in pure love among&s;t them, and in &s;hort plain &s;entences expre&s;&s;ed &s;everal things that re&s;ted upon me, which one of the interpreters gave the peo|ple pretty readily; after which the meeting ended in &s;upplication, and I had cau&s;e hum|bly to acknowledge the loving-kindne&s;s of the Lord toward us; and then I believed that a door remained open for the faithful di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to labour among&s;t the&s;e people.</P>
<P>I now feeling my mind at liberty to re|turn, took my leave of them in general, at the conclu&s;ion of what I &s;aid in meeting; and &s;o we prepared to go homeward: but &s;ome of their mo&s;t active men told us, that when we were ready to move, the people would choo&s;e to come and &s;hake hands with us; which tho&s;e who u&s;ually came to meet|ing did: and from a &s;ecret draught in my mind, I went among&s;t &s;ome who did not u&s;e to go to meeting, and took my leave of them al&s;o: and the moravian and his Indian interpreter, appeared re&s;pectful to us at part|ing. This town &s;tands on the bank of Su&s;|quehannah, and con&s;i&s;ts, I believe, of about forty hou&s;es, mo&s;tly compact together; &s;ome
<PB N="166" REF="013782_0180_0F91A677C64D24D8">
about thirty feet long, and eighteen wide, &s;ome bigger, &s;ome le&s;s; mo&s;tly built of &s;plit plank, one end &s;et in the ground, and the other pinned to a plate, on which lay raf|ters, and covered with bark. I under&s;tand a great flood la&s;t winter overflowed the chief part of the ground where the town &s;tands; and &s;ome were now about moving their hou&s;es to higher ground.</P>
<P>We expected only two Indians to be our company; but when we were ready to go, we found many of them were going to Beth|lehem with &s;kins and furrs, who cho&s;e to go in company with us: &s;o they loaded two canoes, which they de&s;ired us to go in, tell|ing us, that the waters were &s;o rai&s;ed with the rains, that the hor&s;es &s;hould be taken by &s;uch who were better acquainted with the fording places: &s;o we, with &s;everal Indians, went in the canoes, and others went on hor&s;es, there being &s;even be&s;ides ours. And we meeting with the hor&s;emen once on the way by appointment, and then near night, a little below a branch called Tankhannah, we lodged there; and &s;ome of the young men going out a little before du&s;k with their guns, brought in a deer.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;econd day, through dili|gence, we reached Wioming before night, and under&s;tood the Indians were mo&s;tly gone from this place: here we went up a &s;mall creek into the woods with our canoes, and, pitching our tent, carried out our baggage; and before dark our hor&s;es came to us.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="013782_0181_0F91A678DB5423B8">
On the twenty-third day in the morning their hor&s;es were loaded, and we prepared our baggage and &s;o &s;et forward, being in all fourteen; and with diligent travelling were favoured to get near half way to Fort-Allen. The land on this road from Wioming to our frontier being mo&s;tly poor, and good gra&s;s &s;carce, they cho&s;e a piece of low ground to lodge on, as the be&s;t for gra&s;ing; and I having &s;weat much in travelling, and be|ing weary &s;lept &s;ound; I perceived in the night that I had taken cold, of which I was favoured to get better &s;oon.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth day we pa&s;&s;ed Fort-Allen, and lodged near it in the woods.</P>
<P>Having forded the we&s;terly branch of De|laware three times, and thereby had a &s;horter way, and mi&s;&s;ed going over the top of the blue mountains, called the Second Ridge. In the &s;econd time fording, where the river cuts thro' the mountain, the waters being rapid and pretty deep, and my companion's mare being a tall tractable animal, he &s;undry times drove her back thro' the river, and they loaded her with the burthens of &s;ome &s;mall hor&s;es, which they thought not &s;uffici|ent to come thro' with their loads.</P>
<P>The troubles we&s;tward, and the difficulty for Indians to pa&s;s thro' our frontier, I ap|prehend was one rea&s;on why &s;o many came; as expecting that our being in company, would prevent the out&s;ide inhabitants from being &s;urprized.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="013782_0182_0F91A67946A6E568">
On the twenty-fifth day we reached Beth|lehem, taking care on the way to keep fore|mo&s;t, and to acquaint people on and near the road who the&s;e Indians were: this we found very needful; for the frontier inha|bitants were often alarmed at the report of Engli&s;h being killed by Indians we&s;tward.</P>
<P>Among&s;t our company were &s;ome who I did not remember to have &s;een at meeting, and &s;ome of the&s;e at fir&s;t were very re&s;erved; but we being &s;everal days together, and be|having friendly toward them, and making them &s;uitable returns for the &s;ervices they did us, they became more free and &s;ociable.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;ixth day and fir&s;t of the week, having carefully endeavoured to &s;ettle all affairs with the Indians relative to our journey; we took leave of them, and I thought they generally parted with us af|fectionately; &s;o we getting to Richland, had a very comfortable meeting among&s;t our friends: here I parted with my kind friend and companion Benjamin Parvin; and ac|companied by my friend Samuel Foulk, we rode to John Cadwallader's, from whence I reached home the next day, where I found my family middling well; and they and my friends all along appeared glad to &s;ee me re|turn from a journey which they apprehend|ed dangerous: but my mind, while I was out, had been &s;o employed in &s;triving for a perfect re&s;ignation, and I had &s;o often been confirmed in a belief, that whatever the Lord might be plea&s;ed to allot for me, would
<PB N="169" REF="013782_0183_0F91A679F3EF70D0">
work for good: I was careful lea&s;t I &s;hould admit any degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in being glad overmuch, and laboured to improve by tho&s;e trials in &s;uch a manner as my gracious Fa|ther and protector intends for me. Between the Engli&s;h inhabitants and Wehaloo&s;ing, we had only a narrow path, which in many places is much grown up with bu&s;hes, and interrupted by abundance of trees lying acro&s;s it, the&s;e, together with the moun|tains, &s;wamps, and rough &s;tones, make it a difficult road to travel; and the more &s;o, for that rattle&s;nakes abound there, of which we killed four: that people who have never been in &s;uch places, have but an imperfect idea of them; but I was not only taught pa|tience, but al&s;o made thankful to God, who thus led me about and in&s;tructed me, that I might have a quick and lively feeling of the afflictions of my fellow-creatures, who&s;e &s;ituation in life is difficult.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE latter part of the &s;ummer, 1763, there came a man to Mount-Holly, who had before publi&s;hed, by a printed adverti&s;ement, that at a certain publick-hou&s;e, he would &s;hew many wonderful ope|rations, which he therein enumerated.</P>
<P>This man, at the time appointed, did, by &s;light of hand, &s;undry things; which, to tho&s;e gathered, appeared &s;trange.</P>
<P>The next day, I hearing of it, and un|der&s;tanding that the &s;hew was to be conti|nued the next night, and the people to meet about &s;un-&s;et, felt an exerci&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that ac|count: &s;o I went to the publick-hou&s;e in the evening, and told the man of the hou&s;e that I had an inclination to &s;pend a part of the evening there; with which he &s;igni|fied that he was content. Then &s;itting down by the door, I &s;pake to the people as they came together, concerning this &s;hew; and more coming and &s;itting down with us, the &s;eats at the door were mo&s;tly filled; and I had conver&s;ation with them in the fear of the Lord, and laboured to convince them that thus a&s;&s;embling to &s;ee tho&s;e tricks or &s;lights of hands, and be&s;towing their mo|ney to &s;upport men who in that capacity were of no u&s;e in the world, was contrary to the nature of the chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>There was one of the company who, for a time, endeavoured by arguments to &s;hew
<PB N="172" REF="013782_0186_0F91A67C370DB060">
the rea&s;onablene&s;s of their proceedings here|in; but after con&s;idering &s;ome texts of &s;crip|ture, and calmly debating the matter, he gave up the point. So having &s;pent about an hour among&s;t them, and feeling my mind ea&s;y, I departed.</P>
<P>At our yearly-meeting at Philadelphia, on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, 1764, John Smith of Marlborough, aged upwards of eighty years, a faithful mini&s;ter, tho' not eloquent, &s;tood up in our meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, and appearing to be under a great exerci&s;e of &s;pirit, informed friends in &s;ub&s;tance as follows: to wit, "That he had been a member of the &s;ociety upward of &s;ixty years, and well remembered that in tho&s;e early times friends were a plain lowly-minded people; and that there was much tenderne&s;s and contrition in their meetings.&mdash;That at twenty years from that time, the &s;ociety increa&s;ing in wealth, and in &s;ome degree conforming to the fa&s;hions of the world, true humility was le&s;s apparent, and their meetings in general not &s;o lively and edifying&mdash;That at the end of forty years, many of them were grown very rich; that wearing of fine co&s;tly garments, and u&s;ing of &s;ilver (and other) watches, became cu&s;tomary with them, their &s;ons, and their daughters, and many of the &s;ociety made a &s;pacious appear|ance in the world; which marks of outward wealth and greatne&s;s, appeared on &s;ome in our meetings of mini&s;ters and elders; and as the&s;e things became more prevalent, &s;o
<PB N="173" REF="013782_0187_0F91A67CEF932F18">
the powerful over&s;hadowings of the Holy Gho&s;t were le&s;s manife&s;t in the Society&mdash;That there had been a continued increa&s;e of the&s;e ways of life even until now; and that the weakne&s;s which hath now over&s;pread the &s;ociety, and the barrenne&s;s manife&s;t among&s;t us, is matter of much &s;orrow." He then mentioned the uncertainty of his attending the&s;e meetings in future, expect|ing his di&s;&s;olution was now near; and hav|ing tenderly expre&s;&s;ed his concern for us, &s;ignified that he had &s;een in the true light that the Lord would bring back his people from the&s;e things into which they were thus degenerated, but that his faithful &s;ervants mu&s;t fir&s;t go thro' great and heavy exer|ci&s;es therein.</P>
<P>On the twenty-ninth day, the committee appointed by the yearly-meeting to vi&s;it the quarterly and monthly meetings, now gave an account in writing of their proceed|ings in that &s;ervice; in which they &s;igni|fied, that in the cour&s;e of it, they had been apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome per&s;ons holding of|fices in government, incon&s;i&s;tent with our principles; and others who kept &s;laves, re|maining active members in our meetings of di&s;cipline, had been one means of weakne&s;s more and more prevailing in the manage|ment thereof in &s;ome places. After this re|port was read, an exerci&s;e revived on my mind, which, at times, had attended me &s;e|veral years, and inward cries to the Lord were rai&s;ed in me, that the fear of man
<PB N="174" REF="013782_0188_0F91A67FF1E1DA08">
might not prevent me from doing what he required of me; and &s;tanding up, I &s;pake in &s;ub&s;tance as follows: "I have felt a ten|derne&s;s in my mind toward per&s;ons, in two circum&s;tances mentioned in that report; that is, toward &s;uch active members who keep &s;laves, and &s;uch who hold offices in ci|vil government; and have de&s;ired, that friends in all their conduct may be kindly affectioned one toward another. Many friends, who keep &s;laves, are under &s;ome exerci&s;e on that account; and, at times, think about trying them with freedom; but find many things in their way: and the way of living, and annual expences of &s;ome of them are &s;uch, that it &s;eems impractica|ble for them to &s;et their &s;laves free, without changing their own way of life. It has been my lot to be often abroad; and I have ob|&s;erved in &s;ome places, at quarterly and year|ly meetings, and at &s;ome hou&s;es where tra|velling friends and their hor&s;es are often entertained, that the yearly expence of in|dividuals therein is very con&s;iderable: and friends in &s;ome places crouding much on per&s;ons in the&s;e circum&s;tances for entertain|ment, hath often re&s;ted as a burthen on my mind for &s;ome years pa&s;t; and I now ex|pre&s;s it in the fear of the Lord, greatly de|&s;iring that friends now pre&s;ent may duly con&s;ider it."</P>
<P>In the fall of this year, having hired a man to work, I perceived in conver&s;ation that he had been a &s;oldier in the late war on
<PB N="175" REF="013782_0189_0F91A681E039A240">
this continent; and in the evening, giving a narrative of his captivity among&s;t the In|dians, he informed me that he &s;aw two of his fellow captives tortured to death in a very cruel manner.</P>
<P>This relation affected me with &s;adne&s;s, under which I went to bed; and the next morning, &s;oon after I awoke, a fre&s;h and living &s;en&s;e of divine love was &s;pread over my mind; in which I had a renewed pro|&s;pect of the nature of that wi&s;dom from above, which leads to a right u&s;e of all gifts, both &s;piritual and temporal, and gives con|tent therein: under a feeling thereof, I wrote as follows:</P>
<P>"Hath He, who gave me a being attend|ed with many wants unknown to brute-creatures, given me a capacity &s;uperior to theirs? and &s;hewn me, that a moderate ap|plication to bu&s;ine&s;s is proper to my pre&s;ent condition; and that this, attended with his ble&s;&s;ing, may &s;upply all outward wants, while they remain within the bounds he hath fixed; and no imaginary wants pro|ceeding from an evil &s;pirit, have any place in me? Attend then, O my &s;oul! to this pure wi&s;dom, as thy &s;ure conductor thro' the manifold dangers in this world!"</P>
<P>"Doth pride lead to vanity? Doth vani|ty form imaginary wants? Do the&s;e wants prompt men to exert their power in requir|ing that of others, which them&s;elves would rather be excu&s;ed from, were the &s;ame re|quired of them?"</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="013782_0190_0F91A68301070FC0">
"Do tho&s;e proceedings beget hard thoughts? Do hard thoughts, when ripe, become malice? Does malice, when ripe, become revengeful; and in the end inflict terrible pains on their fellow-creatures, and &s;pread de&s;olations in the world?"</P>
<P>"Doth mankind, walking in uprightne&s;s, delight in each other's happine&s;s? And do the&s;e creatures, capable of this attainment by giving way to an evil &s;pirit, employ their wit and &s;trength to afflict and de&s;troy one another?"</P>
<P>"Remember then, O my &s;oul! the quietude of tho&s;e in whom Chri&s;t governs, and in all thy proceedings feel after it!"</P>

<P>Having felt an openne&s;s in my heart to|ward vi&s;iting families in our own meeting, and e&s;pecially in the town of Mount-Holly, the place of my abode, I mentioned it in our monthly-meeting the fore-part of the winter 1764; which being agreed to, and &s;everal friends of our meeting being united in the exerci&s;e, we proceeded therein; and through divine favour were helped in the work, &s;o that it appeared to me as a fre&s;h reviving of godly care among&s;t friends: and the latter part of the &s;ame winter, I joined my friend William Jones, in a vi&s;it to friends families in Mansfield; in which labour, I had cau&s;e to admire the goodne&s;s of the Lord toward us.</P>
<P>Having felt my mind drawn toward a vi&s;it to friends along the &s;ea-coa&s;t from Cape May to near Squan; and al&s;o to vi&s;it &s;ome people in tho&s;e parts, among&s;t whom there is no &s;ettled wor&s;hip; I joined, with my be|loved friend Benjamin Jones, in a vi&s;it there, having friends unity therein: and &s;etting off the twenty-fourth day of the tenth month, 1765, we had a pro&s;perous and very &s;atis|factory journey; feeling, at times, thro' the goodne&s;s of the heavenly Shepherd, the go&s;|pel to flow freely toward a poor people &s;cat|tered in tho&s;e places: and &s;oon after our re|turn, I joined my friends John Sleeper and Elizabeth Smith, in vi&s;iting friends families
<PB N="178" REF="013782_0192_0F91A68545EE47B0">
at Burlington, there being at this time about fifty families of our &s;ociety in that city; and we had cau&s;e humbly to adore our heavenly Father, who baptized us in|to a feeling of the &s;tate of the people, and &s;trengthened us to labour in true go&s;pel love among&s;t them.</P>
<P>An exerci&s;e having, at times, for &s;everal years, attended me, in regard to paying a religious vi&s;it to friends on the Ea&s;tern Shore of Maryland: &s;uch was the nature of this exerci&s;e, that I believed the Lord moved me to travel on foot among&s;t them, that by &s;o travelling I might have a more lively feeling of the condition of the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;laves, &s;et an example of lowline&s;s before the eyes of their ma&s;ters, and be more out of the way of temptation to unprofitable conver&s;e.</P>
<P>The time now drawing near in which I believed it my duty to lay my concern be|fore our monthly meeting, I perceived in conver&s;ation with my beloved friend John Sleeper, that he was under a concern to tra|vel the &s;ame way, and al&s;o to travel on foot in the form of a &s;ervant among&s;t them, as he expre&s;t it. This he told me before he knew aught of my exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>We being thus drawn the &s;ame way, laid our exerci&s;e and the nature of it before friends; and obtaining certificates, we &s;et off the &s;ixth day of the fifth month, 1766; and were at meetings with friends at Wil|mington, Duck-Creek, Little-Creek and Mo|therkill;
<PB N="179" REF="013782_0193_0F91A6862D5AE2B8">
my heart being &s;undry times ten|dered under the divine influence, and en|larged in love toward the people among&s;t whom we travelled.</P>
<P>From Motherkill, we cro&s;&s;ed the country about thirty-five miles to friends at Tucka|hoe in Maryland, and had a meeting there and at Mar&s;hy-Creek.</P>
<P>At the&s;e, our three la&s;t meetings, were a con&s;iderable number of people, followers of one Jo&s;eph Nichols, a preacher; who, I un|der&s;tand, is not in outward fellow&s;hip with any religious &s;ociety of people, but profe&s;&s;|eth nearly the &s;ame principles as our &s;ociety doth, and often travels up and down ap|pointing meetings, to which many people come. I heard &s;ome friends &s;peaking of &s;ome of their neighbours, who had been irreligi|ous people, that were now his followers, and were become &s;ober well-behaved men and women.</P>
<P>Some irregularities, I hear, have been among&s;t the people at &s;everal of his meet|ings; but from the whole of what I have perceived, I believe the man and &s;ome of his followers, are hone&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed, but that &s;kilful fathers are wanting among them: from hence we went to Choptank and Third Haven; and thence to Queen Ann's. The weather having &s;ome days pa&s;t been hot and dry, and we to attend meetings pur&s;uant to appointment, having travelled pretty &s;teadily, and had hard labour in meetings, I grew

weakly; at which I was for a time di&s;cou|raged; but looking over our journey, and thinking how the Lord had &s;upported our minds and bodies, &s;o that we got forward much fa&s;ter than I expected before we came out, I now &s;aw that I had been in danger of too &s;trongly de&s;iring to get &s;oon through the journey, and that this bodily weakne&s;s now attending me was a kindne&s;s to me; and then, in contrition of &s;pirit, I became very thankful to my gracious Father, for this ma|nife&s;tation of his love; and in humble &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his will, my tru&s;t was renewed in him.</P>
<P>On this part of our journey, I had many thoughts on the different circum&s;tances of friends who inhabit Penn&s;ylvania and Jer|&s;ey, from tho&s;e who dwell in Maryland, Vir|ginia, and Carolina. Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey were &s;ettled by many friends, who were convinced of our principles in England in times of &s;ufferings, and coming over bought lands of the natives, and applied them&s;elves to hu&s;bandry in a peaceable way; and many of their children were taught to labour for their living.</P>
<P>Few friends, I believe, came from Eng|land to &s;ettle in any of the&s;e &s;outhern pro|vinces; but by the faithful labours of tra|velling friends in early times, there was con|&s;iderable convincements among&s;t the inhabi|tants of the&s;e parts. Here I remembered my reading of the warlike di&s;po&s;ition of many
<PB N="181" REF="013782_0195_0F91A6884985F918">
of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in tho&s;e provinces, and of their numerous engagements with the na|tives, in which much blood was &s;hed, even in the infancy of tho&s;e colonies. The&s;e peo|ple, inhabiting tho&s;e places, being grounded in cu&s;toms contrary to the pure truth, when &s;ome of them were affected with the power|ful preaching of the Word of Life, and joined in fellow&s;hip with our &s;ociety, they had a great work to go through. It is ob|&s;ervable in the Hi&s;tory of the Reformation from Popery, that it had a gradual progre&s;s from age to age: the uprightne&s;s of the fir&s;t reformers, in attending to the light and under&s;tanding given them, opened the way for &s;incere-hearted people to proceed further afterward; and thus each one truly fearing God, and labouring in tho&s;e works of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s appointed for them in their day, findeth acceptance with him: though, thro' the darkne&s;s of the times, and the corrup|tion of manners and cu&s;toms, &s;ome upright men may have had little more for their day's work than to attend to the righteous princi|ple in their minds, as it related to their own conduct in life, without pointing out to others the whole extent of that, which the &s;ame principle would lead &s;ucceeding ages into. Thus for in&s;tance; among&s;t an impe|rious warlike people, &s;upported by oppre&s;&s;ed &s;laves, &s;ome of the&s;e ma&s;ters, I &s;uppo&s;e, are awakened to feel and &s;ee their error; and, thro' &s;incere repentance, cea&s;e from oppre&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="182" REF="013782_0196_0F91A688F886CF58">
and become like fathers to their &s;er|vants; &s;hewing, by their example, a pat|tern of humility in living, and moderation in governing, for the in&s;truction and admo|nition of their oppre&s;&s;ing neighbours; tho&s;e without carrying the reformation further, I believe have found acceptance with the Lord. Such was the beginning; and tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded them, and have faithfully at|tended to the nature and &s;pirit of the re|formation, have &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity of pro|ceeding forward; and not only to in&s;truct others, by their example, in governing well, but al&s;o to u&s;e means to prevent their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors from having &s;o much power to op|pre&s;s others.</P>
<P>Here I was renewedly confirmed in my mind, that the Lord (who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works, and who&s;e ear is open to the cries and groans of the oppre&s;&s;ed) is graciou&s;ly moving on the hearts of people, to draw them off from the de&s;ire of wealth, and bring them into &s;uch an humble, lowly way of living, that they may &s;ee their way clearly, to repair to the &s;tandard of true righteou&s;ne&s;s; and not only break the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, but know him to be their &s;trength and &s;upport in a time of outward affliction.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ing on cro&s;&s;ed Che&s;ter-River; and had a meeting there, and at Cecil and Sa&s;&s;a|fras. Thro' my bodily weakne&s;s, joined with a heavy exerci&s;e of mind, it was to me an
<PB N="183" REF="013782_0197_0F91A689B703F430">
humbling di&s;pen&s;ation, and I had a very lively feeling of the &s;tate of the oppre&s;&s;ed; yet I often thought, that what I &s;uffered was little, compared with the &s;ufferings of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, and many of his faithful fol|lowers; and may &s;ay with thankfulne&s;s, I was made content.</P>
<P>From Sa&s;&s;afras we went pretty directly home, where we found our families well; and for &s;everal weeks after our return, I had often to look over our journey: and tho' to me it appeared as a &s;mall &s;ervice, and that &s;ome faithful me&s;&s;engers will yet have more bitter cups to drink in tho&s;e &s;outhern pro|vinces for Chri&s;t's &s;ake than we had; yet I found peace in that I had been helped to walk in &s;incerity, according to the under|&s;tanding and &s;trength given me.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth day of the eleventh month, 1766, with the unity of friends at our monthly-meeting, in company with my beloved friend Benjamin Jones, I &s;at out on a vi&s;it to friends in the upper part of this province, having had drawings of love in my heart that way a con&s;iderable time: we travelled as far as Hardwick; and I had in|ward peace in my labours of love among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Thro' the humbling di&s;pen&s;ations of Di|vine Providence, my mind hath been brought into a further feeling of the difficulties of friends and their &s;ervants &s;outh-we&s;tward: and being often engaged in &s;pirit on their
<PB N="184" REF="013782_0198_0F91B4DE9AF0D5D8">
account, I believed it my duty to walk into &s;ome parts of the we&s;tern &s;hore of Mary|land, on a religious vi&s;it: and having ob|tained a certificate from friends of our month|ly-meeting, I took my leave of my family under the heart-tendering operation of truth; and on the twentieth day of the fourth month, 1767, I rode to the ferry oppo&s;ite to Philadelphia, and from thence walked to William Horne's at Derby that evening; and next day pur&s;ued my journey alone, and reached Concord week-day meeting.</P>
<P>Di&s;couragements and a weight of di&s;tre&s;s had at times, attended me in this lone&s;ome walk; thro' which afflictions, I was merci|fully pre&s;erved: and now &s;itting down with friends, my mind was turned toward the Lord, to wait for his holy leadings; who, in infinite love, was plea&s;ed to &s;often my heart into humble contrition, and did re|newedly &s;trengthen me to go forward; that to me it was a time of heavenly refre&s;hment in a &s;ilent meeting.</P>
<P>The next day I came to New-Garden week-day meeting, in which I &s;at with bow|edne&s;s of &s;pirit; and being baptized into a feeling of the &s;tate of &s;ome pre&s;ent, the Lord gave us a heart-tendering &s;ea&s;on; to his name be the prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed on, and was at Nottingham month|ly-meeting; and at a meeting at Little Bri|tain on fir&s;t-day: and in the afternoon &s;e|veral friends came to the hou&s;e where I
<PB N="185" REF="013782_0199_0F91B4E1D47D77D8">
lodged, and we had a little afternoon-meet|ing; and thro' the humbling power of truth, I had to admire the loving-kindne&s;s of the Lord manife&s;ted to us.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;ixth day, I cro&s;&s;ed Su&s;|quehannah; and coming among&s;t people in outward ea&s;e and greatne&s;s, chiefly on the labour of &s;laves, my heart was much affect|ed; and in awful retiredne&s;s, my mind was gathered inward to the Lord, being humbly engaged that in true re&s;ignation I might re|ceive in&s;truction from him, re&s;pecting my duty among&s;t this people.</P>
<P>Tho' travelling on foot was weari&s;ome to my body; yet thus travelling, was agree|able to the &s;tate of my mind.</P>
<P>I went gently on, being weakly; and was covered with &s;orrow and heavine&s;s, on ac|count of the &s;preading prevailing &s;pirit of this world, introducing cu&s;toms grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive on one hand, and cheri&s;hing pride and wantonne&s;s on the other. In this lonely walk, and &s;tate of aba&s;ement and humilia|tion, the &s;tate of the church in the&s;e parts was opened before me; and I may truly &s;ay with the prophet, <Q>I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was di&s;mayed at the &s;eeing of it.</Q> Under this exerci&s;e, I at|tended the quarterly-meeting at Gunpow|der; and, in bowedne&s;s of &s;pirit, I had to open, with much plainne&s;s, what I felt re|&s;pecting friends living in fullne&s;s, on the la|bours of the poor oppre&s;&s;ed negroes; and
<PB N="186" REF="013782_0200_0F91B4E3CC7938D8">
that promi&s;e of the Mo&s;t High was now re|vived: <Q>I will gather all nations and tongues; and they &s;hall come and &s;ee my glory.</Q>&mdash;Here the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and his ta&s;ting death for every man, and the travels, &s;ufferings, and martyrdoms of the apo&s;tles, and primitive chri&s;tians, in labour|ing for the conver&s;ion of the gentiles, was livingly revived in me; and according to the mea&s;ure of &s;trength afforded, I laboured in &s;ome tenderne&s;s of &s;pirit, being deeply af|fected among&s;t them: and thus the differ|ence between the pre&s;ent treatment which the&s;e gentiles the negroes receive at our hands, and the labours of the primitive chri&s;tians for the conver&s;ion of the gentiles, was pre&s;&s;ed home, and the power of truth came over us; under a feeling of which, my mind was united to a tender-hearted people in tho&s;e parts; and the meeting con|cluded in a &s;en&s;e of God's goodne&s;s toward his humble dependant children.</P>
<P>The next day was a general meeting for wor&s;hip, much crouded; in which I was deeply engaged in inward cries to the Lord for help, that I might &s;tand wholly re&s;igned, and move only as he might be plea&s;ed to lead me: and I was mercifully helped to la|bour hone&s;tly and fervently among&s;t them, in which I found inward peace; and the &s;in|cere were comforted.</P>
<P>From hence I turned toward Pipe-Creek, and pa&s;&s;ed on to the Red-Lands; and had
<PB N="187" REF="013782_0201_0F91B4E3EAA6C708">
&s;everal meetings among&s;t friends in tho&s;e parts. My heart was often tenderly affect|ed, under a &s;en&s;e of the Lord's goodne&s;s, in &s;anctifying my troubles and exerci&s;es, turn|ing them to my comfort, and, I believe, to the benefit of many others; for, I may &s;ay with thankfulne&s;s, that in this vi&s;it, it ap|peared like a fre&s;h tendering vi&s;itation in mo&s;t places.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed on to the we&s;tern quarterly-meet|ing in Penn&s;ylvania; during the &s;everal days of this meeting, I was mercifully pre&s;erved in an inward feeling after the mind of truth, and my publick labours tended to my humi|liation, with which I was content: and after the quarterly-meeting of wor&s;hip ended, I felt drawings to go to the women's meet|ing of bu&s;ine&s;s; which was very full: and here the humility of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a pat|tern for us to walk by, was livingly opened before me; and in treating on it, my heart was enlarged; and it was a baptizing time. From hence I went on; and was at meet|ings at Concord, Middletown, Providence, and Haddonfield, and &s;o home; where I found my family well. A &s;en&s;e of the Lord's merciful pre&s;ervation in this my journey, ex|cites reverent thankfulne&s;s to him.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day of the ninth month, 1767, with the unity of friends, I &s;et off on a vi&s;it to friends in the upper part of Berks and Philadelphia counties; was at eleven meetings in about two weeks; and
<PB N="188" REF="013782_0202_0F91B4E51E728288">
have renewed cau&s;e to bow in reverence be|fore the Lord, who, by the powerful extend|ings of his humbling goodne&s;s, opened my way among&s;t friends, and made the meet|ings (I tru&s;t) profitable to us. And the win|ter following, I joined friends on a vi&s;it to friends families, in &s;ome part of our meet|ing; in which exerci&s;e, the pure influence of divine love, made our vi&s;its reviving.</P>
<P>On the fifth day of the fifth month, 1768, I left home, under the humbling hand of the Lord, having obtained a certificate, in order to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings in Maryland; and to proceed without a hor&s;e looked clear|e&s;t to me. I was at the quarterly-meetings at Philadelphia and Concord; and then went on to Che&s;ter river; and cro&s;&s;ing the Bay with friends, was at the yearly-meeting at We&s;t-River: thence back to Che&s;ter-River; and taking a few meetings in my way, pro|ceeded home. It was a journey of much in|ward waiting; and as my eye was to the Lord, way was, &s;everal times, opened to my humbling admiration, when things had ap|peared very difficult.</P>
<P>In my return, I felt a relief of mind, very comfortable to me; having, thro' divine help, laboured in much plainne&s;s, both with friends &s;elected, and in the more publick meetings: &s;o that (I tru&s;t) the pure witne&s;s, in many minds, was reached.</P>

years, within the limits of our monthly-meeting, re&s;pecting that of exerci&s;ing pure righteou&s;ne&s;s toward the negroes; in which I have lived under a labour of heart, that equity might be &s;teadily kept to. On this account, I have had &s;ome clo&s;e exerci&s;es among&s;t friends; in which, I may thank|fully &s;ay, I find peace: and as my medita|tions have been on univer&s;al love, my own conduct in time pa&s;t, became of late very grievous to me.</P>
<P>As per&s;ons &s;etting negroes free in our pro|vince, are bound by law to maintain them, in ca&s;e they have need of relief; &s;ome who &s;crupled keeping &s;laves for term of life, in the time of my youth, were wont to detain their young negroes in their &s;ervice till thir|ty years of age, without wages, on that ac|count: and with this cu&s;tom I &s;o far agreed, that I, being joined to another friend, in executing the will of a decea&s;ed friend, once &s;old a negro lad till he might attain the age of thirty years, and applied the money to the u&s;e of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>With aba&s;ement of heart, I may now &s;ay, that &s;ometimes, as I have &s;et in a meeting, with my heart exerci&s;ed toward that awful Being, who re&s;pecteth not per&s;ons nor co|lours, and have looked upon this lad, I have felt that all was not clear in my mind re|&s;pecting him: and as I have attended to this exerci&s;e, and fervently &s;ought the Lord, it hath appeared to me, that I &s;hould make

&s;ome re&s;titution, but in what way I &s;aw not till lately; when being under &s;ome concern, that I may be re&s;igned to go on a vi&s;it to &s;ome part of the We&s;t-Indies; and was un|der clo&s;e engagement of &s;pirit, &s;eeking to the Lord for coun&s;el herein: that of my joining in the &s;ale afore&s;aid, came heavily upon me; and my mind, for a time, was covered with darkne&s;s and &s;orrow; and under this &s;ore affliction, my heart was &s;oftened to receive in&s;truction: and here I fir&s;t &s;aw, that as I had been one of the two executors, who had &s;old this lad nine years longer than is common for our own children to &s;erve, &s;o I &s;hould now offer a part of my &s;ub&s;tance to redeem the la&s;t half of that nine years; but as the time was not yet come, I executed a bond, binding me, and my executors, to pay to the man he was &s;old to, what to can|did men might appear equitable, for the la&s;t four years and a half of his time, in ca&s;e the &s;aid youth &s;hould be living, and in a condition likely to provide comfortably for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The ninth day of the tenth month, 1769.

While I was under this bodily weakne&s;s, my mind being, at times, exerci&s;ed for my fellow-creatures in the We&s;t-Indies, I grew jealous over my&s;elf, le&s;t the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the pro&s;pect &s;hould hinder me from obediently attending thereto: for tho' I knew not that the Lord required me to go there; yet I be|lieved, that re&s;ignation was now called for in that re&s;pect: and feeling a danger of not being wholly devoted to him, I was fre|quently engaged to watch unto prayer, that I might be pre&s;erved; and upwards of a year having pa&s;&s;ed, I walked one day in a &s;oli|ry wood, my mind being covered with awful|ne&s;s, cries were rai&s;ed in me to my merciful Father, that he would graciou&s;ly keep me in faithfulne&s;s; and it then &s;ettled on my mind as a duty, to open my condition to friends at our monthly-meeting; which I did &s;oon after, as follows:</P>

often bowed in &s;pirit before the Lord, with inward breathings to him, that I might be rightly directed. And I may here note, that what I have before related of my being, when young, joined as an executor with an|other friend, in executing the will of the decea&s;ed, our having &s;old a negro lad till he might attain the age of thirty years, was now the occa&s;ion of great &s;orrow to me: and after having &s;ettled matters relating to this youth, I provided a &s;ea-&s;tore and bed, and things for the voyage; and hearing of a ve&s;&s;el likely to &s;ail from Philadelphia for Bar|badoes, I &s;pake with one of the owners at Burlington, and &s;oon after went to Phila|delphia on purpo&s;e to &s;peak with him again: at which time he told me, there was a friend in town who was part owner of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el; but I felt no inclination to &s;peak with him, but returned home: and a while after, I took leave of my family; and going to Phi|ladelphia, had &s;ome weighty conver&s;ation with the fir&s;t-mentioned owner, and &s;hewed him a writing, as follows:</P>

of &s;laves; but then, had not much concern about them, &s;ave only that the rum might be u&s;ed in moderation; nor was this concern &s;o weightily attended to, as I now believe it ought to have been: but of late years being further informed, re&s;pecting the oppre&s;&s;ions too generally exerci&s;ed in the&s;e i&s;lands, and thinking often on the degrees that are in connections of intere&s;t and fellow&s;hip with the works of darkne&s;s, Ephe. v. 11.

<P>I was now under great exerci&s;e of mind; and my tears were poured out before the Lord, with inward cries, that he would gra|ciou&s;ly help me under the&s;e trials.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, I believe my mind was re|&s;igned, but did not feel clearne&s;s to pro|ceed; and my own weakne&s;s, and the nece&s;|&s;ity of divine in&s;truction, was impre&s;&s;ed up|on me.</P>

homeward; and then I went over among&s;t friends on the Jer&s;ey &s;hore, and tarried till the morning on which they had appointed to &s;ail: and as I lay in bed the latter part of that night, my mind was comforted; and I felt what I e&s;teemed a fre&s;h confirmation, that it was the Lord's will, that I &s;hould pa&s;s through &s;ome further exerci&s;es near home.</P>
<P>So I went home, and &s;till felt like a &s;o|journer with my family: and in the fre&s;h &s;pring of pure love, had &s;ome labours in a private way among&s;t friends, on a &s;ubject relating to truth's te&s;timony; under which, I had frequently been exerci&s;ed in heart for &s;ome years. I remember, as I walked on the road under this exerci&s;e, that pa&s;&s;age in Eze|kiel came fre&s;h before me: <Q>Whither&s;oever their faces were turned, thither they went.</Q> and I was graciou&s;ly helped to di&s;charge my duty, in the fear and dread of the Al|mighty.</P>
<P>After a few weeks, it plea&s;ed the Lord to vi&s;it me with a pleuri&s;y; and after I had lain a few days, and felt the di&s;order very grievous, I was thoughtful how it might end.</P>
<P>I had of late, through various exerci&s;es, been much weaned from the plea&s;ant things of this life; and I now thought, if it was the Lord's will to put an end to my labours, and graciou&s;ly receive me into the arms of his mercy, death would be acceptable to me;

but if it was his will to farther refine me under affliction, and make me, in any de|gree, u&s;eful in his church, I de&s;ired not to die.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING been &s;ome time under a reli|gious concern to prepare for cro&s;&s;ing the &s;eas, in order to vi&s;it friends in the north|ern parts of England, and more particularly in York&s;hire: after weighty con&s;ideration, I thought it expedient to inform friends, at our
<PB N="204" REF="013782_0218_0F91B4F5D97CA0B0">
monthly-meeting at Burlington, of it; who, having unity with me therein, gave me a certificate; and I afterwards communicated the &s;ame to our quarterly-meeting, and they likewi&s;e certified their concurrence therewith. Some time after which, at the general &s;pring-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, I thought it my duty to acquaint them of the religious exerci&s;e which attended my mind; with which, they likewi&s;e &s;ignified their unity by a certificate, dated the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, 1772, directed to friends in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>In the fourth month following, I thought the time was come for me to make &s;ome en|quiry for a &s;uitable conveyance; being ap|prehen&s;ive, that as my concern was princi|pally toward the northern parts of England, it would be mo&s;t proper to go in a ve&s;&s;el bound to Liverpool or Whitehaven: and while I was at Philadelphia, deliberating on this occa&s;ion, I was informed, that my belov|ed friend Samuel Emlen, jun. intending to go to London; and having taken a pa&s;&s;age for him&s;elf in the cabbin of the &s;hip, called Mary and Elizabeth, of which James Sparks was ma&s;ter, and John Head, of the city of Philadelphia, one of the owners; and I feel|ing a draft in my mind toward the &s;teerage of the &s;ame &s;hip, went fir&s;t and opened to Samuel the feeling I had concerning it.</P>
<P>My beloved friend wept when I &s;pake to him, and appeared glad that I had thoughts
<PB N="205" REF="013782_0219_0F91B4F74F600518">
of going in the ve&s;&s;el with him, though my pro&s;pect was toward the &s;teerage; and he offering to go with me, we went on board, fir&s;t into the cabbin, a commodious room, and then into the &s;teerage; where we &s;at down on a che&s;t, the &s;ailors being bu&s;y about us: then the owner of the &s;hip came, and &s;at down with us.</P>
<P>Here my mind was turned toward Chri&s;t, the heavenly coun&s;ellor; and I feeling, at this time, my own will &s;ubjected, my heart was contrite before him.</P>
<P>A motion was made by the owner, to go and &s;et in the cabbin, as a place more re|tired; but I felt ea&s;y to leave the &s;hip, and made no agreement as to a pa&s;&s;age in her; but told the owner, if I took a pa&s;&s;age in the &s;hip, I believed it would be in the &s;teerage; but did not &s;ay much as to my exerci&s;e in that ca&s;e.</P>
<P>After I went to my lodgings, and the ca&s;e was a little known in town, a friend laid be|fore me the great inconvenience attending a pa&s;&s;age in the &s;teerage; which, for a time, appeared very di&s;couraging to me.</P>
<P>I &s;oon after went to bed, and my mind was under a deep exerci&s;e before the Lord; who&s;e helping hand was manife&s;ted to me as I &s;lept that night, and his love &s;trengthen|ed my heart: and in the morning, I went with two friends on board the ve&s;&s;el again; and after a &s;hort time &s;pent therein, I went with Samuel Emlen to the hou&s;e of the
<PB N="206" REF="013782_0220_0F91B4F76C471158">
owner; to whom, in the hearing of Samuel only, I opened my exerci&s;e, in &s;ub&s;tance as follows, in relation to a &s;cruple I felt with regard to a pa&s;&s;age in the cabbin:</P>
<P>I told the owner, that on the out&s;ide of that part of the &s;hip where the cabbin was, I ob&s;erved &s;undry &s;orts of carved work and imagery; and that in the cabbin I ob&s;erved &s;ome &s;uperfluity of workman&s;hip of &s;everal &s;orts; and that according to the ways of men's reckoning, the &s;um of money to be paid for a pa&s;&s;age in that apartment, hath &s;ome relation to the expence in furni&s;hing it to plea&s;e the minds of &s;uch who give way to a conformity to this world; and that in this ca&s;e, as in other ca&s;es, the monies received from the pa&s;&s;engers, are calculated to an&s;wer every expence relating to their pa&s;&s;age, and among&s;t the re&s;t of the&s;e &s;uperfluities: and that in this ca&s;e, I felt a &s;cruple with regard to paying my money to defray &s;uch ex|pences.</P>
<P>As my mind was now opened, I told the owner, that I had, at &s;everal times in my travels, &s;een great oppre&s;&s;ions on this conti|nent; at which my heart had been much affected, and brought into a feeling of the &s;tate of the &s;ufferers. And having many times been engaged, in the fear and love of God, to labour with tho&s;e under whom the oppre&s;&s;ed have been borne down and afflict|ed; I have often perceived, that a view to get riches, and provide e&s;tates for children,
<PB N="207" REF="013782_0221_0F91B4F881D786F0">
to live conformable to cu&s;toms, which &s;tand in that &s;pirit wherein men have regard to the honours of this world&mdash;that in the pur|&s;uit of the&s;e things, I had &s;een many entan|gled in the &s;pirit of oppre&s;&s;ion; and the ex|erci&s;e of my &s;oul had been &s;uch, that I could not find peace, in joining in any thing which I &s;aw was again&s;t that wi&s;dom which is pure.</P>
<P>After this, I agreed for a pa&s;&s;age in the &s;teerage; and hearing in town that Jo&s;eph White had a de&s;ire to &s;ee me, I felt the re|viving of a de&s;ire to &s;ee him, and went then to his hou&s;e, and next day home; where I tarried two nights: and then early in the morning, I parted with my family, under a &s;en&s;e of the humbling hand of God upon me; and going to Philadelphia, had oppor|tunity with &s;everal of my beloved friends; who appeared to be concerned for me, on account of the unplea&s;ant &s;ituation of that part of the ve&s;&s;el, where I was likely to lodge.</P>
<P>In the&s;e opportunities, my mind, through the mercies of the Lord, was kept low, in an inward waiting for his help; and friends having expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire, that I might have a place more convenient than the &s;teer|age, did not urge, but appeared di&s;po&s;ed to leave me to the Lord.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed two nights in Philadelphia, I went the next day to Derby monthly-meet|ing; where, through the &s;trength of divine
<PB N="208" REF="013782_0222_0F91B4F8DD1822A8">
love, my heart was enlarged toward the youth then pre&s;ent; under which I was helped to labour in &s;ome tenderne&s;s of &s;pi|rit. Then lodging at William Horne's, I, with one friend, went to Che&s;ter; where meeting with Samuel Emlen, we went on board the fir&s;t day of the fifth month, 1772: and as I &s;at down alone, on a &s;eat on the deck, I felt a &s;atisfactory evidence, that my proceedings were not in my own will, but under the power of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Seventh day of the fifth month: have had rough weather, mo&s;tly &s;ince I came on board; and the pa&s;&s;engers, James Reynolds, John Till-Adams, Sarah Logan and her hired maid, and John Bi&s;pham, all &s;ea-&s;ick, more or le&s;s, at times; from which &s;ickne&s;s, thro' the tender mercies of my heavenly Fa|ther, I have been pre&s;erved: my afflictions now being of another kind.</P>
<P>There appeared an openne&s;s in the minds of the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip and in the cabbin pa&s;&s;engers toward me; we were often toge|ther on the deck, and &s;ometimes in the cab|bin.</P>
<P>My mind, thro' the merciful help of the Lord, hath been pre&s;erved in a good degree watchful, and inward; and have, this day, great cau&s;e to be thankful, in that I remain to feel quietne&s;s of mind.</P>

<P>Now concerning lads being trained up as &s;eamen: I believe a communication from one part of the world to &s;ome other parts of it, by &s;ea, is, at times, con&s;i&s;tent with the will of our heavenly Father; and to educate &s;ome youth in the practice of &s;ailing, I believe may be right: but how lamentable is the pre&s;ent corruption of the world! how im|pure are the channels thro' which trade hath a conveyance! how great is that danger, to which poor lads are now expo&s;ed, when placed on &s;hipboard to learn the art of &s;ail|ing?</P>
<P>Five lads, training up for the &s;eas, were now on board this &s;hip; two of them brought up among&s;t our &s;ociety; one of which hath a right among&s;t friends, by name James Nailor, to who&s;e father James Nailor, men|tioned in Sewel's hi&s;tory, appears to have been uncle.</P>

<P>O that all may take heed and beware of covetou&s;ne&s;s! O that all may learn of Chri&s;t, who was meek and low of heart! Then in faithfully following him, he will teach us to be content with food and raiment, without re|&s;pect to the cu&s;toms or honours of this world.</P>
<P>Men thus redeemed, will feel a tender con|cern for their fellow-creatures, and a de&s;ire that tho&s;e in the lowe&s;t &s;tations may be a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed and encouraged; and where owners of &s;hips attain to the perfect law of liberty, and are doers of the word, the&s;e will be ble&s;&s;ed in their deeds.</P>
<P>A &s;hip at &s;ea commonly &s;ails all night, and the &s;eamen take their watches four hours at a time.</P>
<P>Ri&s;ing to work in the night, is not com|monly plea&s;ant in any ca&s;e; but in dark rainy nights it is very di&s;agreeable, even though each man were furni&s;hed with all conveniences: but if men mu&s;t go out at midnight to help manage the &s;hip in the rain, and having &s;mall room to &s;leep and lay their garments in, are often be&s;et to furni&s;h them&s;elves for the watch; their garments or &s;ome thing relating to their bu&s;ine&s;s being wanting, and not ea&s;ily found; when from the urgency occa&s;ioned by high winds, they are ha&s;tened and called up &s;uddenly: here is a

<P>If after they have been on deck &s;everal hours in the night, and come down into the &s;teerage &s;oaking wet, and are &s;o clo&s;e &s;towed that proper convenience for change of gar|ment is not ea&s;ily come at, but for want of proper room their wet garments thrown in heaps, and &s;ometimes, through much crowd|ing, are trodden under foot, in going to their lodgings and getting out of them, and great difficulties, at times, each one to find his own: here are tryals on the poor &s;ailors.</P>
<P>Now as I have been with them in my lodge, my heart hath often yearned for them; and tender de&s;ires been rai&s;ed in me, that all owners and ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els may dwell in the love of God, and therein act uprightly; and by &s;eeking le&s;s for gain, and looking carefully to their ways, may earn|e&s;tly labour to remove all cau&s;e of provoca|tion from the poor &s;eamen, either to fret or u&s;e exce&s;s of &s;trong drink; for, indeed, the poor creatures, at times, in the wet and cold, &s;eem to apply to &s;trong drink to &s;up|ply the want of other convenience.</P>
<P>Great reformation in the world is want|ing, and the nece&s;&s;ity of it, among&s;t the&s;e who do bu&s;ine&s;s on great waters, hath, at this time, been abundantly opened before me.</P>
<P>The eighth day of the fifth month.&mdash;This morning the clouds gathered, the wind blew
<PB N="212" REF="013782_0226_0F91B4FBE73FC678">
&s;trong from &s;outh-ea&s;tward, and before noon increa&s;ed to that degree that &s;ailing appeared dangerous: the &s;eamen then bound up &s;ome of their &s;ails, and took down &s;ome; and the &s;torm increa&s;ing, they put the dead lights, &s;o called, into the cabbin-windows, and lighted a lamp as at night.</P>
<P>The wind now blew vehemently, and the &s;ea wrought to that degree, that an awful &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s prevailed in the cabbin, in which I &s;pent, I believe, about &s;eventeen hours; for I believed the poor wet toiling &s;eamen, had need of all the room in the crouded &s;teerage, and the cabbin pa&s;&s;engers had given me frequent invitations.</P>
<P>They cea&s;ed now from &s;ailing; and put the ve&s;&s;el in the po&s;ture, called lying-to.</P>
<P>My mind in this tempe&s;t, thro' the gra|cious a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Lord, was pre&s;erved in a good degree of re&s;ignation; and I felt, at times, a few words in his love to my &s;hip-mates, in regard to the all-&s;ufficiency of Him who formed the great deep, and who&s;e care is &s;o exten&s;ive, that a &s;parrow falls not without his notice: and thus in a tender frame of mind, &s;pake to them of the nece&s;&s;ity of our yielding, in true obedience, to the in&s;tructions of our heavenly Father, who &s;ometimes, through adver&s;ities, intend|eth our refinement.</P>
<P>About eleven at night, I went out on the deck, when the &s;ea wrought exceedingly, and the high foaming waves, all round about,
<PB N="213" REF="013782_0227_0F91B4FCA5CC9AF0">
had in &s;ome &s;ort the appearance of fire; but did not give much, if any, light.</P>
<P>The &s;ailor, then at the helm, &s;aid, he lately &s;aw a corpo&s;ant at the head of the ma&s;t.</P>
<P>About this time I ob&s;erved the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip ordered the carpenter to keep on the deck; and tho' he &s;aid little, I apprehended his care was, that the carpenter with his axe might be in readine&s;s, in ca&s;e of any extre|mity.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the vehemency of the wind abated; and before morning, they again put the &s;hip under &s;ail.</P>
<P>The tenth day of the month, and fir&s;t of the week, it being fine weather, we had a meeting in the cabbin, at which mo&s;t of the &s;eamen were pre&s;ent: this meeting to me was a &s;trengthening time.</P>
<P>The thirteenth day of the month. As I continue to lodge in the &s;teerage, I feel an openne&s;s this morning, to expre&s;s &s;omething further of the &s;tate of my mind, in re&s;pect to poor lads bound apprentice to learn the art of &s;ailing. As I believe &s;ailing is of &s;ome u&s;e in the world, a labour of &s;oul attends me, that the pure coun&s;el of truth may be humbly waited for in this ca&s;e, by all concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;eas.</P>
<P>A pious father, who&s;e mind is exerci&s;ed for the everla&s;ting welfare of his child, may not, with a peaceable mind, place him out to an employment among&s;t a people, who&s;e
<PB N="214" REF="013782_0228_0F91B4FD6504A388">
common cour&s;e of life is manife&s;tly corrupt and prophane; &s;o great is the pre&s;ent defect among&s;t &s;ea-faring men, in regard to piety and virtue: and through an abundant traf|fick, and many &s;hips of war, &s;o many peo|ple are employed on the &s;ea, that this &s;ubject of placing lads to the employment appears very weighty.</P>
<P>Prophane examples are very corrupting, and very forcible. And as my mind, day after day, and night after night, hath been affected with a &s;ympathizing tenderne&s;s to|ward poor children, put to the employment of &s;ailors, I have &s;ometimes had weighty conver&s;ation with the &s;ailors in the &s;teerage, who were mo&s;tly re&s;pectful to me, and more and more &s;o the longer I was with them: they mo&s;tly appeared to take kindly what I &s;aid to them; but their minds have appeared to be &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with that almo&s;t univer&s;al depravity among&s;t &s;ailors, that the poor creatures in their an&s;wers to me on this &s;ubject, have revived in my remem|brance, that of the degenerate Jews a little before the captivity, as repeated by Jeremiah the prophet, "There is no hope."</P>
<P>Now under this exerci&s;e, a &s;en&s;e of the de&s;ire of outward gain prevailing among&s;t us, hath felt grievous; and a &s;trong call to the profe&s;&s;ed followers of Chri&s;t, hath been rai&s;ed in me; that, all may take heed, le&s;t, through loving this pre&s;ent world, they be found in a continued neglect of duty, with

<P>Silence, as to every motion proceeding from the love of money, and an humble waiting upon God, to know his will con|cerning us, hath now appeared nece&s;&s;ary: he alone is able to &s;trengthen us to dig deep, to remove all which lies between us and the &s;afe foundation, and &s;o direct us in our out|ward employments, that pure univer&s;al love may &s;hine forth in our proceedings.</P>
<P>De&s;ires ari&s;ing from the &s;pirit of truth, are pure de&s;ires; and when a mind, divinely opened toward a young generation, is made &s;en&s;ible of corrupting examples, powerfully working, and exten&s;ively &s;preading among&s;t them, how moving is the pro&s;pect!</P>
<P>A great trade to the coa&s;t of Africa for &s;laves; of which I now heard frequent con|ver&s;ation among the &s;ailors!</P>
<P>A great trade in that which is rai&s;ed and prepared thro' grievous oppre&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>A great trade in &s;uperfluity of workman|&s;hip, formed to plea&s;e the pride and vanity of people's minds!</P>

<P>In a world of dangers and difficulties, like a de&s;olate thorny wilderne&s;s, how precious! how comfortable! how &s;afe! are the lead|ings of Chri&s;t, the good &s;hepherd; who &s;aid, "I know my &s;heep; and am known of mine."</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth day of the month. Wind for &s;everal days pa&s;t often high, what the &s;ailors call &s;qually, rough &s;ea and frequent rains. This la&s;t night a very trying night to the poor &s;eamen; the water, chief part of the night, running over the main deck, and &s;ometimes breaking waves came on the quar|ter deck. The latter part of the night, as I lay in bed, my mind was humbled under the power of divine love; and re&s;ignedne&s;s to the great Creator of the earth and the &s;eas, renewedly wrought in me, who&s;e fa|therly care over his children felt precious to my &s;oul: and de&s;ires were now renewed in me, to embrace every opportunity of being inwardly acquainted with the hard&s;hips and difficulties of my fellow-creatures, and to labour in his love for the &s;preading of pure univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s on the earth. The opportunities being frequent of hearing con|ver&s;ation among&s;t the &s;ailors, in re&s;pect to the voyages to Africa, and the manner of bringing the deeply oppre&s;&s;ed &s;laves into our i&s;lands. The thoughts of their condition, frequently in chains and &s;etters on board the
<PB N="217" REF="013782_0231_0F91B4FFAB142320">
ve&s;&s;els, with hearts loaded with grief, under the apprehen&s;ions of mi&s;erable &s;lavery; my mind was frequently opened to meditate on the&s;e things.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth day of the month, and fir&s;t of the week, we had a meeting in the cabbin; to which the &s;eamen generally came. My &s;pirit was contrite before the Lord; who&s;e love, at this time, affected my heart.</P>
<P>This afternoon I felt a tender &s;ympathy of &s;oul, with my poor wife and family left be|hind; in which &s;tate, my heart was en|larged in de&s;ires, that they may walk in that humble obedience wherein the everla&s;ting Father may be their guide and &s;upport, thro' all the difficulties in this world; and a &s;en&s;e of that gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance, thro' which my mind hath been &s;trengthened to take up the cro&s;s and leave them, to travel in the love of truth, hath begotten thankfulne&s;s in my heart to our great Helper.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth day of the month, and fir&s;t of the week, a clear plea&s;ant morn|ing: and as I &s;at on deck, I felt a reviving in my nature; which, through much rainy weather, and high winds, being &s;hut up in a clo&s;e unhealthy air, was weakened.</P>
<P>Several nights of late I felt breathing dif|ficult; that a little after the ri&s;ing of the &s;econd watch (which is about midnight) I got up, and &s;tood, I believe, near an hour, with my face near the hatchway, to get the fre&s;h air at the &s;mall vacancy under the
<PB N="218" REF="013782_0232_0F91B501A3058F98">
hatch door; which is commonly &s;hut down, partly to keep out rain, and &s;ometimes to keep the breaking waves from da&s;hing into the &s;teerage.</P>
<P>I may, with thankfulne&s;s to the Father of mercies, acknowledge, that in my pre|&s;ent weak &s;tate, my mind hath been &s;upport|ed to bear the affliction with patience; and have looked at the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation as a kindne&s;s from the great Father of mankind, who, in this my floating pilgrimage, is in &s;ome degree bringing me to feel that, which many thou&s;ands of my fellow-creatures of|ten &s;uffer in a greater degree.</P>
<P>My appetite failing, the tryal hath been the heavier; and I have felt tender breath|ings in my &s;oul after God, the fountain of comfort, who&s;e inward help hath &s;upplied, at times, the want of outward convenience: and &s;trong de&s;ires have attended me, that his family, who are acquainted with the mov|ings of his Holy Spirit, may be &s;o redeemed from the love of money, and from that &s;pi|rit in which men &s;eek honour one of ano|ther; that in all bu&s;ine&s;s, by &s;ea or land, we may con&s;tantly keep in view the coming of his kingdom on earth, as it is in heaven; and by faithfully following this &s;afe guide, &s;hew forth examples, tending to lead out of that under which the creation groans!</P>
<P>This day we had a meeting in the cabbin; in which I was favoured in &s;ome degree to experience the fulfilling of that &s;aying of
<PB N="219" REF="013782_0233_0F91B501DB403DF8">
the prophet, <Q>The Lord hath been a &s;trength to the poor, a &s;trength to the needy in their di&s;tre&s;s;</Q> for which, my heart is bowed in thankfulne&s;s before him.</P>
<P>The twenty-eighth day of the month: wet weather of late, &s;mall winds inclining to calms; our &s;eamen have ca&s;t a lead, I &s;up|po&s;e about one hundred fathom, but find no bottom: foggy weather this morning.</P>
<P>Through the kindne&s;s of the great Pre|&s;erver of men, my mind remains quiet; and a degree of exerci&s;e, from day to day, at|tends me, that the pure peaceable govern|ment of Chri&s;t may &s;pread and prevail a|mong&s;t mankind.</P>
<P>The leading on of a young generation, in that pure way, in which the wi&s;dom of this world hath no place: where parents and tu|tors, humbly waiting for the heavenly Coun|&s;ellor, may example them in the truth, as it is in Je&s;us. This, for &s;everal days, hath been the exerci&s;e of my mind; O how &s;afe, how quiet is that &s;tate, where the &s;oul &s;tands in pure obedience to the voice of Chri&s;t, and a watchful care is maintained, not to follow the voice of the &s;tranger!</P>
<P>Here Chri&s;t is felt to be our &s;hepherd; and under his leading, people are brought to a &s;tability: and where he doth not lead for|ward, we are bound in the bonds of pure love, to &s;tand &s;till and wait upon him. In the love of money, and in the wi&s;dom of this world, bu&s;ine&s;s is propo&s;ed, then the
<PB N="220" REF="013782_0234_0F91B502F4BA3AE0">
urgency of affairs pu&s;h forward; nor can the mind, in this &s;tate, di&s;cern the good and per|fect will of God concerning us.</P>
<P>The love of God is manife&s;ted, in graci|ou&s;ly calling us to come out of that which &s;tands in confu&s;ion; but if we bow not in the name of Je&s;us; if we give not up tho&s;e pro&s;pects of gain, which, in the wi&s;dom of this world, are open before us, but &s;ay in our hearts, I mu&s;t needs go on; and in go|ing on, I hope to keep as near to the purity of truth, as the bu&s;ine&s;s before me will ad|mit of: here the mind remains entangled, and the &s;hining of the light of life into the &s;oul is ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>This query opens in my mind in the love of Chri&s;t. Where &s;hall a pious father place his &s;on apprentice, to be in&s;tructed in the practice of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;eas; and have faith to believe, that Chri&s;t, our holy Shepherd, leads him to place his &s;on there?</P>
<P>Surely the Lord calls to mourning and deep humiliation, that in his fear we may be in&s;tructed, and led &s;afely on through the great difficulties and perplexities in this pre|&s;ent age.</P>
<P>In an entire &s;ubjection of our wills, the Lord graciou&s;ly opens a way for his people, where all their wants are bounded by his wi&s;dom; and here we experience the &s;ub|&s;tance of what Mo&s;es the prophet figured out in the water of &s;eparation, as a purification from &s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="013782_0235_0F91B5036F2C2C00">
E&s;au is mentioned as a child red all over, like a hairy garment: in E&s;au is repre&s;ented the natural will of man. In preparing the water of &s;eparation, a red heifer without blemi&s;h, on which there had been no yoke, was to be &s;lain, and her blood &s;prinkled by the prie&s;t &s;even times toward the tabernacle of the congregation: then her &s;kin, her fle&s;h, and all pertaining to her, was to be burnt without the camp; and of her a&s;hes the water was prepared. Thus the crucify|ing the old man, or natural will, is repre|&s;ented; and hence comes a &s;eparation from that carnal mind, which is death.</P>
<P><Q>He who toucheth the dead body of a man, and puri&s;ieth not him&s;elf with the water of &s;eparation, he defileth the taber|nacle of the Lord; he is unclean.</Q> Numb. xix. 13.</P>
<P>If any, through the love of gain, go forth into bu&s;ine&s;s, wherein they dwell as a|mong&s;t the tombs, and touch the bodies of tho&s;e who are dead: if the&s;e, through the infinite love of God, feel the power of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t to crucify them to the world, and therein learn humbly to follow the di|vine leader:&mdash;here is the judgment of this world&mdash;here the prince of this world is ca&s;t out.</P>
<P>The water of &s;eparation is felt; and tho' we have been among&s;t the &s;lain, and thro' the de&s;ire of gain have touched the dead bo|dy of a man; yet, in the purifying love of

Chri&s;t, we are wa&s;hed in the water of &s;epa|ration, are brought off from that bu&s;ine&s;s, from that gain, and from that fellow&s;hip, which was not agreeable to his holy will: and I have felt a renewed confirmation in the time of this voyage, that the Lord, in his infinite love, is calling to his vi&s;ited chil|dren, &s;o to give up all outward po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and means of getting trea&s;ures, that his Ho|ly Spirit may have free cour&s;e in their hearts, and direct them in all their proceedings.</P>
<P>To feel the &s;ub&s;tance pointed at in this figure, man mu&s;t know death, as to his own will.</P>
<P>"No man can &s;ee God, and live:" This was &s;poken by the Almighty to Mo&s;es the prophet; and opened by our ble&s;&s;ed Re|deemer.</P>
<P>As death comes on our own wills, and a new life is formed in us, the heart is purified, and prepared to under&s;tand clearly. <Q>Ble&s;&s;|ed are the pure in heart, for they &s;hall &s;ee God.</Q> In purity of heart, the mind is divinely opened to behold the nature of uni|ver&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s, or the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the kingdom of God. <Q>No man hath &s;een the Father, &s;ave he that is of God; he hath &s;een the Father.</Q></P>
<P>The natural mind is active about the things of this life; and in this natural acti|vity, bu&s;ine&s;s is propo&s;ed, and a will in us to go forward in it. And as long as this na|tural will remains un&s;ubjected, &s;o long there

<P>In ob&s;erving their dull appearance at &s;ea, and the pining &s;ickne&s;s of &s;ome of them, I often remembered the fountain of goodne&s;s, who gave being to all creatures, and who&s;e love extends to that of caring for the &s;par|rows; and believe, where the love of God is verily perfected, and the true &s;pirit of go|vernment watchfully attended to, a tender|ne&s;s toward all creatures made &s;ubject to us will be experienced; and a care felt in us, that we do not le&s;&s;en that &s;weetne&s;s of life, in the animal creation, which the great Creator intends for them under our government.</P>
<P>The fourth day of the month. Wet wea|ther, high winds, and &s;o dark that we could &s;ee but a little way. I perceived our &s;eamen were apprehen&s;ive of danger of mi&s;&s;ing the Channel; which, I under&s;tood, was narrow. In a while, it grew lighter; and they &s;aw the land, and they knew where we were. Thus the Father of mercies was plea&s;ed to try us with the &s;ight of dangers; and then graci|ou&s;ly, from time to time, deliver from them: thus &s;paring our lives, that in humility and reverence, we may walk before him, and put our tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>About noon a pilot came off from Dover; where my beloved friend Samuel Emlen went on &s;hore, and thence to London, about &s;even|ty-two miles by land; but I felt ea&s;y in &s;taying in the &s;hip.</P>

The &s;eventh day of the month, and fir&s;t of the week. Clear morning, lay at anchor for the tide, and had a parting meeting with the &s;hip's company; in which, my heart was enlarged in a fervent concern for them, that they may come to experience &s;alvation thro' Chri&s;t.&mdash;Had a head wind up the Thames; lay &s;ometimes at anchor; &s;aw many &s;hips pa&s;&s;ing, and &s;ome at anchor near; and had large opportunity of feeling the &s;pirit in which the poor bewildered &s;ailors too gene|rally live.&mdash;That lamentable degeneracy, which &s;o much prevails on the people em|ployed on the &s;eas, &s;o affected my heart, that I may not ea&s;ily convey the feeling I have had to another.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;ea-faring life in general, appears &s;o oppo&s;ite to that of a pi|ous education; &s;o full of corruption, and extreme alienation from God; &s;o full of ex|amples, the mo&s;t dangerous to young peo|ple, that in looking toward a young genera|tion, I feel a care for them, that they may have an education different from the pre&s;ent education of lads at &s;ea: and that all of us, who are acquainted with the pure go&s;pel &s;pi|rit, may lay this ca&s;e to heart, may remem|ber the lamentable corruptions which at|tends the conveyance of merchandize acro&s;s the &s;eas, and &s;o abide in the love of Chri&s;t, that being delivered from the love of mo|ney, from the entangling expences of a cu|rious, delicate luxurious life, we may learn contentment with a little; and promote

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the eighth day of the &s;ixth month, 1772, we landed at London; and I went &s;traightway to the yearly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, which had been ga|thered (I &s;uppo&s;e) about half an hour.</P>
<P>In this meeting, my mind was humbly contrite: in the afternoon, the meeting of
<PB N="228" REF="013782_0242_0F91B50B51A53E10">
bu&s;ine&s;s opened; which, by adjournments, held near a week.&mdash;in the&s;e meetings, I of|ten felt a living concern for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of friends in the pure life of truth: and my heart was enlarged in the meeting of mi|ni&s;ters, meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, and in &s;everal meetings of publick wor&s;hip; and I felt my mind united in true love, to the faithful la|bourers now gathered at this yearly-meet|ing.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth day of the month, I left London, and went to a quarterly-meeting at Hertford.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day of the &s;eventh month. I have been at quarterly-meetings at Sherring|ton, Northampton, Banbury and Shipton; and had &s;undry meetings between: my mind hath been bowed under a &s;en&s;e of divine goodne&s;s manife&s;ted among&s;t us; my heart hath been often enlarged in true love, both among&s;t mini&s;ters and elders, and in publick meetings; that through the Lord's good|ne&s;s, I believe it hath been a fre&s;h vi&s;itation to many, in particular to the youth.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth day of the month. Was this day at Birmingham: have been at meet|ings at Coventry, Warwick, in Oxford&s;hire, and &s;undry other places; have felt the hum|bling hand of the Lord upon me; and thro' his tender mercies find peace in the labours I have gone through.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;ixth day of the month. I have continued travelling northward, vi&s;it|ing
<PB N="229" REF="013782_0243_0F91B50BA3584F30">
meetings: was this day at Nottingham; which, in the forenoon e&s;pecially, was, thro' divine love, a heart-tendering &s;ea&s;on: next day had a meeting in a friend's hou&s;e with friends children and &s;ome friends; this, thro' the &s;trengthening arm of the Lord, was a time to be thankfully remembered.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day of the eighth month, and fir&s;t of the week, was this day at Sheffield, a large inland town: have been at &s;undry meetings la&s;t week; and feel inward thank|fulne&s;s for that divine &s;upport, which hath been graciou&s;ly extended to me.</P>
<P>The ninth day of the month, and fir&s;t of the week, was at Ru&s;hworth: have lately pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ome painful labour; but have been comforted, under a &s;en&s;e of that divine vi&s;itation, which I feel extended to|ward many young people.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth day of the month, and fir&s;t of the week, was at Settle: it hath of late been a time of inward poverty; under which, my mind hath been pre&s;erved in a watchful tender &s;tate, feeling for the mind of the ho|ly Leader, and find peace in the labours I have pa&s;&s;ed through.</P>
<P>On enquiry, in many places, I find the price of rye about five &s;hillings, wheat about eight &s;hillings, <HI>per</HI> bu&s;hel; oatmeal twelve &s;hillings for an hundred and twenty pounds; mutton from three-pence to five-pence <HI>per</HI> pound; bacon, from &s;even-pence to nine-pence; chee&s;e, from four-pence to &s;ix-pence;
<PB N="230" REF="013782_0244_0F91B50C7ABCDD80">
butter, from eight-pence to ten-pence; hou&s;e-rent, for a poor man, from twenty-five &s;hil|lings to forty &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> year, to be paid weekly; wood, for fire, very &s;carce and dear; coal, in &s;ome places, two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence <HI>per</HI> hundred weight; but near the pits, not a quarter &s;o much. O, may the wealthy con&s;ider the poor!</P>
<P>The wages of labouring men in &s;everal counties toward London, is ten-pence <HI>per</HI> day in common bu&s;ine&s;s, the employer finds &s;mall-beer, and the labourer finds his own food; but in harve&s;t and hay time, wages is about one &s;hilling <HI>per</HI> day, and the la|bourer hath all his diet. In &s;ome parts of the north of England, poor labouring men have their food where they work; and ap|pear, in common, to do rather better than nearer London: indu&s;trious women, who &s;pin in the factories, get &s;ome four-pence, &s;ome five-pence, and &s;o on to &s;ix, &s;even, eight, nine or ten-pence <HI>per</HI> day, and find their own hou&s;e-room and diet. Great num|bers of poor people live chiefly on bread and water in the &s;outhern parts of England, and &s;ome in the northern parts; and there are many poor children not taught even to read. May tho&s;e who have plenty, lay the&s;e things to heart!</P>
<P>Stage-coaches frequently go upwards of an hundred miles in twenty-four hours; and I have heard friends &s;ay, in &s;everal places, that it is common for hor&s;es to be killed with
<PB N="231" REF="013782_0245_0F91B50D33F8A060">
hard driving, and many others driven till they grow blind.</P>
<P>Po&s;t-boys pur&s;ue their bu&s;ine&s;s, each one to his &s;tage, all night thro' the winter: &s;ome boys, who ride long &s;tages, &s;uffer greatly on winter nights; and, at &s;everal places, I have heard of their being froze to death. So great is the hurry in the &s;pirit of this world, that in aiming to do bu&s;ine&s;s quick, and to gain wealth, the creation, at this day, doth loudly groan!</P>
<P>As my journey hath been without a hor&s;e, I have had &s;everal offers of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted on my way in the&s;e &s;tage-coaches; but have not been in them: nor have I had freedom to &s;end letters by the&s;e po&s;ts, in the pre&s;ent way of their riding; the &s;tages being &s;o fix|ed, and one boy dependant on another as to time, that they commonly go upward of one hundred miles in twenty-four hours; and in the cold long winter nights, the poor boys &s;uffer much.</P>
<P>I heard in America of the way of the&s;e po&s;ts; and cautioned friends in the general meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at Philadel|phia, and in the yearly-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at London, not to &s;end letters to me on any common occa&s;ion by po&s;t. And though, on this account, I may be likely to hear &s;eldomer from my family left behind; yet, for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, I am, thro' di|vine favour, made content.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="013782_0246_0F91B50DE6F54058">
I have felt great di&s;tre&s;s of mind, &s;ince I came on this i&s;land, on account of the mem|bers of our &s;ociety being mixed with the world in various &s;orts of bu&s;ine&s;s and traf|fick, carried on in impure channels. Great is the trade to Africa for &s;laves! and in load|ing the&s;e &s;hips, abundance of people are em|ployed in the factories; among&s;t whom are many of our &s;ociety. Friends, in early times, refu&s;ed, on a religious principle, to make or trade in &s;uperfluities; of which, we have many large te&s;timonies on record: but for want of faithfulne&s;s, &s;ome gave way; even &s;ome, who&s;e examples were of note in our &s;ociety; and from thence others took more liberty. Members of our &s;ociety worked in &s;uperfluities, and bought and &s;old them; and thus dimne&s;s of &s;ight came over many: at length, friends got into the u&s;e of &s;ome &s;uperfluities in dre&s;s, and in the furniture of their hou&s;es; and this hath &s;pread from le&s;s to more, till &s;uperfluity of &s;ome kinds is common among&s;t us.</P>
<P>In this declining &s;tate, many look at the example one of another, and too much ne|glect the pure feeling of truth. Of late years, a deep exerci&s;e hath attended my mind, that friends may dig deep, may carefully ca&s;t forth the loo&s;e matter, and get down to the Rock, the &s;ure foundation, and there hearken to that divine voice which gives a clear and certain &s;ound; and I have felt in that which
<PB N="233" REF="013782_0247_0F91B50EA4175D58">
doth not deceive, that if friends, who have known the truth, keep in that tenderne&s;s of heart, where all views of outward gain are given up, and their tru&s;t is only on the Lord, he will graciou&s;ly lead &s;ome to be pat|terns of deep &s;elf-denial in things relating to trade and handicraft labour; and that &s;ome, who have plenty of the trea&s;ures of this world, will example in a plain frugal life, and pay wages to &s;uch whom they may hire, more liberally than is now cu&s;tomary in &s;ome places.</P>
<P>The twenty-third day of the month, was this day at Pre&s;ton-Patrick, and had a com|fortable meeting. I have, &s;everal times, been entertained at the hou&s;es of friends, who had &s;undry things about them which had the ap|pearance of outward greatne&s;s; and as I have kept inward, way hath opened for con|ver&s;ation with &s;uch in private, in which di|vine goodne&s;s hath favoured us together, with heart-tendering times.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;ixth day of the month. Be|ing now at George Crosfields, in the county of We&s;tmoreland, I feel a concern to com|mit to writing, that which to me hath been a ca&s;e uncommon.</P>
<P>In a time of &s;ickne&s;s with the pleuri&s;y, a little upward of two years and a half ago, I was brought &s;o near the gates of death, that I forgot my name: being then de&s;irous to know who I was, I &s;aw a ma&s;s of matter of a dull gloomy colour, between the &s;outh
<PB N="234" REF="013782_0248_0F91B5109B39E4F8">
and the ea&s;t; and was informed, that this ma&s;s was human beings in as great mi&s;ery as they could be, and live; and that I was mixed in with them, and that henceforth I might not con&s;ider my&s;elf as a di&s;tinct or &s;eparate being. In this &s;tate I remained &s;e|veral hours. I then heard a &s;oft melodious voice, more pure and harmonious than any I had heard with my ears before; I believ|ed it was the voice of an angel, who &s;pake to the other angels: the words were&mdash;<HI>John Woolman is dead.</HI> I &s;oon remembered that I once was John Woolman; and being a&s;&s;ured that I was alive in the body, I greatly won|dered what that heavenly voice could mean.</P>
<P>I believed, beyond doubting, that it was the voice of an holy angel; but, as yet, it was a my&s;tery to me.</P>
<P>I was then carried in &s;pirit to the mines, where poor oppre&s;&s;ed people were digging rich trea&s;ures for tho&s;e called chri&s;tians; and heard them bla&s;pheme the name of Chri&s;t, at which I was grieved; for his name to me was precious.</P>
<P>Then I was informed, that the&s;e hea|then were told, that tho&s;e who oppre&s;&s;ed them were the followers of Chri&s;t; and they &s;aid among&s;t them&s;elves, If Chri&s;t directed them to u&s;e us in this &s;ort, then Chri&s;t is a cruel tyrant.</P>
<P>All this time the &s;ong of the angel re|mained a my&s;tery; and in the morning, my dear wife and &s;ome others coming to my bed|&s;ide,
<PB N="235" REF="013782_0249_0F91B510E18632F8">
I a&s;ked them, if they knew who I was: and they telling me, I was John Woolman, thought I was light-headed: for I told them not what the angel &s;aid, nor was I di&s;po&s;ed to talk much to any one; but was very de|&s;irous to get &s;o deep, that I might under|&s;tand this my&s;tery.</P>
<P>My tongue was often &s;o dry, that I could not &s;peak till I had moved it about and gathered &s;ome moi&s;ture, and as I lay &s;till for a time, at length I felt divine power pre|pare my mouth that I could &s;peak; and then I &s;aid, <Q>I am crucified with Chri&s;t, never|thele&s;s I live; yet not I, but Chri&s;t that liveth in me: and the life I now live in the fle&s;h, is by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me.</Q></P>
<P>Then the my&s;tery was opened; and I per|ceived there was joy in heaven over a &s;inner who had repented; and that that language (<HI>John Woolman is dead</HI>) meant no more than the death of my own will.</P>
<P>Soon after this I coughed, and rai&s;ed much bloody matter; which I had not done during this vi&s;ion: and now my natural under&s;tand|ing returned as before.&mdash;Here I &s;aw, that people getting &s;ilver ve&s;&s;els to &s;et off their ta|bles at entertainments, was often &s;tained with worldly glory; and that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, I &s;hould take heed how I fed my|&s;elf from out of &s;ilver ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Soon after my recovery, I, going to our monthly-meeting, dined at a friend's hou&s;e
<PB N="236" REF="013782_0250_0F91B51199C06070">
where drink was brought in &s;ilver ve&s;&s;els, and not in any other; and I wanting &s;ome drink, told him my ca&s;e with weeping: and he ordered &s;ome drink for me in another ve&s;|&s;el.</P>
<P>The like I afterwards went through in &s;everal friend's hou&s;es in America, and have al&s;o in England, &s;ince I came here: and have cau&s;e, with humble reverence, to acknow|ledge the loving-kindne&s;s of my heavenly Father, who hath pre&s;erved me in &s;uch a tender frame of mind, that none, I believe, have ever been offended at what I have &s;aid on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After this &s;ickne&s;s, I &s;pake not in publick meetings for wor&s;hip for near one year; but my mind was very often in company with the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;laves, as I &s;at in meetings: and tho', under this di&s;pen&s;ation, I was &s;hut up from &s;peaking, yet the &s;pring of the go&s;|pel mini&s;try was, many times, livingly open|ed in me; and the divine gift operated by abundance of weeping, in feeling the op|pre&s;&s;ion of this people. It being &s;o long &s;ince I pa&s;&s;ed thro' this di&s;pen&s;ation, and the matter remaining fre&s;h and livingly in my mind, I believe it &s;afe&s;t for me to commit it to writing.</P>
<P>The thirtieth day of the month. This morning I wrote a letter, in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"MY mind is often affected as I pa&s;s along, under a &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of many poor people, who &s;it under that &s;ort of mini&s;try which requires much outward labour to &s;upport it; and the loving-kind|ne&s;s of our heavenly Father, in opening a pure go&s;pel mini&s;try in this nation, hath of|ten rai&s;ed thankfulne&s;s in my heart to him. I often remember the conflicts of the faith|ful under per&s;ecution, and now look at the free exerci&s;e of the pure gift uninterrupted by outward laws, as a tru&s;t committed to us; which requires our deepe&s;t gratitude, and mo&s;t careful attention. I feel a tender con|cern, that the work of reformation, &s;o pro&s;|perou&s;ly carried on in this land within a few ages pa&s;t, may go forward and &s;pread a|mong&s;t the nations; and may not go back|ward, thro' du&s;t gathering on our garments, who have been called to a work &s;o great and &s;o precious."</P>

<P>"I look at that precious gift be&s;towed on thee, with awfulne&s;s before Him who gave it: and feel a care, that we may be &s;o &s;epa|rated to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, that tho&s;e things which proceed from the &s;pirit of this world, may have no place among&s;t us."</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I re&s;ted a few days, in body and mind, with our friend Jane Crosfield; who was once in America: was, on the &s;ixth day of the week, at Kendal in We&s;tmoreland; and at Greyrig meeting the thirtieth day of the month, and fir&s;t of the week.</P>
<P>I have known poverty of late; and been graciou&s;ly &s;upported to keep in the patience: and am thankful, under a &s;en&s;e of the good|ne&s;s of the Lord toward tho&s;e that are of a contrite &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth day of the ninth month, and fir&s;t of the week, was this day at Counter-&s;ide; a large meeting-hou&s;e, and very full: and thro' the opening of pure love, it was
<PB N="239" REF="013782_0253_0F91B5149DF3D8C0">
a &s;trengthening time to me, and (I believe) to many more.</P>
<P>The thirteenth day of the month. Was this day at Richmond, a &s;mall meeting; but the town's people coming in, the hou&s;e was crowded: it was a time of heavy labour; and (I believe) was a profitable meeting.</P>
<P>At this place I heard that my kin&s;man William Hunt from North-Carolina, who was on a religious vi&s;it to friends in Eng|land, departed this life on the ninth day of the ninth month, in&s;tant, of the &s;mall-pox, at Newca&s;tle.&mdash;He appeared in the mini&s;try when a youth; and his labours therein were of good &s;avor. He travelled much in that work in America. I once heard him &s;ay in public te&s;timony, that his concern was (in that vi&s;it) to be devoted to the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t &s;o fully, that he might not &s;pend one minute in plea&s;ing him&s;elf: which words, joined with his example, was a means of &s;tir|ring up the pure mind in me.</P>
<P>Having of late travelled often in wet wea|ther, thro' narrow &s;treets in towns and vil|lages, where dirtine&s;s under foot, and the &s;cent ari&s;ing from that filth, which more or le&s;s infects the air of all thick &s;ettled towns; and I being but weakly, have felt di&s;tre&s;s both in body and mind with that which is impure.</P>
<P>In the&s;e journies I have been where much cloth hath been dyed; and &s;undry times
<PB N="240" REF="013782_0254_0F91B515CFC32BE8">
walked over ground, where much of their dye &s;tuffs have drained away.</P>
<P>Here I have felt a longing in my mind, that people might come into cleanne&s;s of &s;pi|rit, cleanne&s;s of per&s;on, cleanne&s;s about their hou&s;es and garments.</P>
<P>Some, who are great, carry delicacy to a great height them&s;elves, and yet the real cleanline&s;s is not generally promoted. Dyes being invented partly to plea&s;e the eye, and partly to hide dirt, I have felt in this weak &s;tate, travelling in dirtine&s;s and affected with unwhole&s;ome &s;cents, a &s;trong de&s;ire that the nature of dyeing cloth to hide dirt may be more fully con&s;idered.</P>
<P>To hide dirt in our garments, appears op|po&s;ite to real cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>To wa&s;h garments, and keep them &s;weet, this appears cleanly.</P>
<P>Thro' giving way to hiding dirt in our garments, a &s;pirit which would cover that which is di&s;agreeable, is &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>Real cleanne&s;s becometh a holy people: but hiding that which is not clean by colour|ing our garments, appears contrary to the &s;weetne&s;s of &s;incerity.</P>

On this vi&s;it to England I have felt &s;ome in&s;tructions &s;ealed on my mind, which I am concerned to leave in writing, for the u&s;e of &s;uch who are called to the &s;tation of a mini|&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t being the Prince of Peace, and we being no more than mini&s;ters, I find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us, not only to feel a concern in our fir&s;t going forth, but to experience the renewing thereof, in the appointment of meetings.</P>
<P>I felt a concern in America, to prepare for this voyage; and being through the mercy of God, brought &s;afe here, my heart was like a ve&s;&s;el that wanted vent; and for &s;eve|ral weeks at fir&s;t, when my mouth was open|ed in meetings, it often felt like the rai&s;ing of a gate in a water cour&s;e, where a weight of water lay upon it; and in the&s;e labours there appeared a fre&s;h vi&s;itation to many, e&s;pecially the youth; but &s;ometimes after this, I felt empty and poor, and yet felt a nece&s;&s;i|ty to appoint meetings.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate I was exerci&s;ed to abide in the pure life of truth, and in all my labours to watch diligently again&s;t the motions of &s;elf in my own mind.</P>
<P>I have frequently felt a nece&s;&s;ity to &s;tand up, when the &s;pring of the mini&s;try was low, and to &s;peak from the nece&s;&s;ity, in that which &s;ubjecteth the will of the creature; and here|in I was united with the &s;uffering &s;eed, and found inward &s;weetne&s;s in the&s;e mortifying labours.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="013782_0256_0F91B51833AC87E8">
As I have been pre&s;erved in a watchful at|tention to the divine leader, under the&s;e di&s;|pen&s;ations, enlargement at times hath fol|lowed, and the power of truth hath ro&s;e high|er in &s;ome meetings, than I ever knew it be|fore through me.</P>
<P>Thus I have been more and more in&s;truct|ed, as to the nece&s;&s;ity of depending, not up|on a concern which I felt in America, to come on a vi&s;it to England; but upon the fre&s;h in|&s;tructions of Chri&s;t the Prince of Peace, from day to day.</P>
<P>Now of late, I felt a &s;top in the appoint|ment of meetings, not wholly but in part; and I do not feel liberty to appoint them &s;o quick one after another as I have heretofore.</P>
<P>The work of the mini&s;try, being a work of divine love, I feel that the openings there|of are to be waited for, in all our appoint|ments.</P>
<P>Oh how deep is divine wi&s;dom! Chri&s;t puts forth his mini&s;ters, and goeth before them; and oh how great is the danger of departing from the pure feeling of that which leadeth &s;afely!</P>
<P>Chri&s;t knoweth the &s;tate of the people, and in the pure feeling of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, their &s;tates are opened to his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t knoweth when the fruit-bearing branches them&s;elves have need of purging.</P>
<P>Oh that the&s;e le&s;&s;ons may be remembered by me! and that all who appoint meetings, may proceed in the pure feeling of duty.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="013782_0257_0F91B518599178A0">
I have &s;ometimes felt a nece&s;&s;ity to &s;tand up, but that &s;pirit which is of the world hath &s;o much prevailed in many, and the pure life of truth been &s;o pre&s;&s;ed down, that I have gone forward, not as one travelling in a road ca&s;t up, and well prepared, but as a man walking through a miry place, in which are &s;tones here and there, &s;afe to &s;tep on; but &s;o &s;ituated that one &s;tep being taken, time is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee where to &s;tep next.</P>
<P>Now I find that in the pure obedience, the mind learns contentment, in appearing weak and fooli&s;h to that wi&s;dom which is of the world; and in the&s;e lowly labours, they who &s;tand in a low place, rightly exerci&s;ed under the cro&s;s, will find nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The gift is pure, and while the eye is &s;in|gle in attending thereto, the under&s;tanding is pre&s;erved clear; &s;elf is kept out; we rejoice in filling up that which remains of the af|flictions of Chri&s;t, for his body's &s;ake, which is the church.</P>
<P>The natural man loveth eloquence, and many love to hear eloquent orations; and if there is not a careful attention to the gift, men who have once labour'd in the pure go&s;|pel mini&s;try, growing weary of &s;uffering, and a&s;hamed of appearing weak, may kindle a fire, compa&s;s them&s;elves about with &s;parks, and walk in the light; not of Chri&s;t who is under &s;uffering; but of that fire, which they, going from the gift, have kindled: And that in hearers, which is gone from the meek &s;uf|fering &s;tate, into the worldly wi&s;dom, may
<PB N="244" REF="013782_0258_0F91B519F72BBFB0">
be warmed with this fire, and &s;peak highly of the&s;e labours. That which is of God ga|thers to God; and that which is of the world is owned by the world.</P>
<P>In this journey a labour hath attended my mind, that the mini&s;ters among&s;t us may be pre&s;erved in the meek feeling life of truth, where we may have no de&s;ire, but to follow Chri&s;t and be with him; that when he is un|der &s;uffering we may &s;uffer with him; and never de&s;ire to ri&s;e up in dominion, but as he by the virtue of his own &s;pirit may rai&s;e us.</P>
<P>A few days after writing the&s;e con&s;iderati|ons, our dear friend in the cour&s;e of his reli|gious vi&s;its, came to the city of York, and attended mo&s;t of the &s;ittings of the quarterly meeting there; but before it was over, was taken ill of the &s;mall-pox. Our friend Tho|mas Prie&s;tman and others who attended him, pre&s;erved the following minutes of his expre&s;|&s;ions in the time of his &s;ickne&s;s, and of his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>1&s;t day, the 27th of the 9th month 1772. His di&s;order appeared to be the &s;mall-pox: being a&s;ked to have a doctor's advice, he &s;ig|nified he had not freedom or liberty in his mind &s;o to do, &s;tanding wholly re&s;igned to his will, who gave him life, and who&s;e pow|er he had witne&s;&s;ed to rai&s;e and heal him in &s;ickne&s;s before, when he &s;eemed nigh unto death; and if he was to wind up now, he
<PB N="245" REF="013782_0259_0F91B51B01364D80">
was perfectly re&s;igned, having no will either to live or die, and did not choo&s;e any &s;hould be &s;ent for to him: but a young man, an apothecary, coming of his own accord the next day, and de&s;iring to do &s;omething for him, he &s;aid he found a freedom to confer with him and the other friends about him, and if any thing &s;hould be propo&s;ed, as to medicine that did not come thro' defiled chan|nels or oppre&s;&s;ive hands, he &s;hould be wil|ling to con&s;ider and take it, &s;o far as he found freedom.</P>
<P>2d day. He &s;aid he felt the di&s;order to af|fect his head, &s;o that he could think little, and but as a child; and de&s;ired if his under|&s;tanding &s;hould be more affected, to have nothing given him that tho&s;e about knew he had a te&s;timony again&s;t.</P>
<P>Third-day he uttered the following pray|er.&mdash;O Lord my God, the amazing hor|rors of darkne&s;s were gathered around me and covered me all over, and I &s;aw no way to go forth; I felt the depth and extent of the mi&s;ery of my fellow creatures &s;eparated from the divine harmony, and it was heavi|er than I could bear, and I was cru&s;hed down under it, I lifted up my hand, I &s;tretched out my arm, but there was none to help me; I looked round about and was amazed; in the depths of mi&s;ery, O Lord! I remembered that thou art omnipotent, that I had called thee Father, and I felt that I loved thee, and I was made quiet in thy will, and I waited for deliverance from thee; thou had&s;t pity

upon me when no man could help me; I &s;aw that meekne&s;s under &s;uffering was &s;hewed to us in the mo&s;t affecting example of thy Son, and thou taught me to follow him, and I &s;aid "thy will O Father be done."</P>
<P>Fourth day morning, being a&s;ked how he felt him&s;elf, he meekly an&s;wered, I don't know that I have &s;lept this night, I feel the di&s;order making its progre&s;s, but my mind is mercifully pre&s;erved in &s;tillne&s;s and peace: &s;ometime after he &s;aid he was &s;en&s;ible the pains of death mu&s;t be hard to bear, but if he e&s;caped them now, he mu&s;t &s;ometime pa&s;s thro' them, and he did not know that he could be better prepared, but had no will in it. He &s;aid he had &s;ettled his outward af|fairs to his mind, had taken leave of his wife and family as never to return, leaving them to the divine protection; adding, and tho' I feel them near to me at this time, yet I freely give them up, having a hope that they will be provided for. And a little after &s;aid, This trial is made ea&s;ier than I could have thought, my will being wholly taken away; for if I was anxious for the event it would have been harder, but I am not, and my mind enjoys a perfect calm.</P>
<P>In the night a young woman having given him &s;omething to drink, he &s;aid, My child thou &s;eems very kind to me a poor creature, the Lord will reward thee for it. A while af|ter he cried out with great earne&s;tne&s;s of &s;pirit, Oh my Father! my Father! and &s;oon after he &s;aid, Oh my Father! my Father!
<PB N="247" REF="013782_0261_0F91B51C38E7A850">
how comfortable art thou to my &s;oul in this trying &s;ea&s;on. Being a&s;ked if he could take a little nouri&s;hment; after &s;ome pau&s;e he re|plied, my child I cannot tell what to &s;ay to it; I &s;eem nearly arrived where my &s;oul &s;hall have re&s;t from all its troubles. After giving in &s;omething to be in&s;erted in his journal, he &s;aid, I believe the Lord will now excu&s;e me from exerci&s;es of this kind; and I &s;ee no work but one which is to be the la&s;t wrought by me in this world, the me&s;&s;enger will come that will relea&s;e me from all the&s;e troubles; but it mu&s;t be in the Lord's time, which I am waiting for. He &s;aid he had laboured to do whatever was required, according to the ability received, in the remembrance of which he had peace; and tho' the di&s;order was &s;trong at times, and would like a whirl|wind come over his mind; yet it had hither|to been kept &s;teady and center'd in everla&s;t|ing love; adding, and if that be mercifully continued, I a&s;k nor de&s;ire no more. An|other time he &s;aid, he had long had a view of vi&s;iting this nation, and &s;ometime before he came had a dream, in which he &s;aw him&s;elf in the northern parts of it, and that the &s;pring of the go&s;pel was opened in him much as in the beginning of friends, &s;uch as George Fox and William Dew&s;berry, and he &s;aw the different &s;tates of the people, as clear as he had ever &s;een flowers in a garden; but in his going along he was &s;uddenly &s;topt, tho' he could not &s;ee for what end; but
<PB N="248" REF="013782_0262_0F91B51E31FA99F8">
looking towards home, fell into a flood of tears which waked him.</P>
<P>At another time he &s;aid, my draught &s;eem|ed &s;tronge&s;t towards the North, and I men|tioned in my own monthly-meeting, that attending the quarterly-meeting at York, and being there looked like home to me.</P>
<P>Fifth-day night, having repeatedly con|&s;ented to take medicine with a view to &s;ettle his &s;tomach, but without effect; the friend then waiting on him, &s;aid thro' di&s;tre&s;s, what &s;hall I do now? He an&s;wered with great compo&s;ure, Rejoice ever more, and in every thing give thanks; but added a little after, this is &s;ometimes hard to come at.</P>
<P>Sixth-day morning he broke forth early in &s;upplication on this wi&s;e, O Lord it was thy power that enabled me to for&s;ake &s;in in my youth, and I have felt thy brui&s;es for di&s;|obedience; but as I bowed under them thou healed me, continuing a father and a friend; I feel thy power now, and I beg that in the approaching trying moment Thou wilt keep my heart &s;tedfa&s;t unto thee. Upon his giv|ing directions to a friend concerning &s;ome little things, &s;he &s;aid I will take care, but hope thou wilt live to order them thy&s;elf; he reply'd, my hope is in Chri&s;t, and tho' I may &s;eem a little better, a change in the di&s;|order may &s;oon happen, and my little &s;trength be di&s;&s;olved, and if it &s;o happens, I &s;hall be gathered to my everla&s;ting re&s;t. On her &s;ay|ing &s;he did not doubt that, but could not help mourning to &s;ee &s;o many faithful &s;er|vants

removed at &s;o low a time; he &s;aid all good cometh from the Lord, who&s;e power is the &s;ame, and can work as he &s;ees be&s;t. The &s;ame day he had given directions about wrapping his corp&s;e; perceiving a friend to weep, he &s;aid I would rather thou would&s;t guard again&s;t weeping for me, my &s;i&s;ter, I &s;orrow not, tho' I have had &s;ome painful con|flicts, but now they &s;eem over and matters well &s;ettled, and I took at the face of my dear redeemer, for &s;weet is his voice and his countenance is comely.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day, fourth of the tenth month, being very weak and in general difficult to be un|der&s;tood, he uttered a few words in comme|moration of the Lord's goodne&s;s; and add|ed, how tenderly have I been waited on in this time of affliction, in which I may &s;ay in Job's words, Tedious days and weari&s;ome nights are appointed unto me, and how ma|ny are &s;pending their time and money in vanity and &s;uperfluities, while thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands want the nece&s;&s;aries of life, who might be relieved by them, and their di&s;tre&s;&s;es at &s;uch a time as this, in &s;ome degree &s;oftened by the admini&s;tring &s;uitable things.</P>
<P>Second-day morning the apothecary who appeared very anxious to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, being pre&s;ent, he queried about the probability of &s;uch a load of matter being thrown off his weak body, and the apothecary making &s;ome remarks implying he thought it might; he &s;poke with an audible voice on this wi&s;e,
<PB N="250" REF="013782_0264_0F91B51F2EA4A0C8">
My dependance is on the Lord Je&s;us, who I tru&s;t will forgive my &s;ins, which is all I hope for, and if it be his will to rai&s;e up this body again, I am content; and if to die, I and re|&s;igned; and if thou can&s;t not be ea&s;y with|out trying to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature, I &s;ubmit: after which his throat was &s;o much affected, that it was very difficult for him to &s;peak &s;o as to be under&s;tood, and frequently wrote when he wanted any thing. About the &s;econd hour on fourth-day morning he a&s;ked for pen and ink, and at &s;everal times with much difficulty wrote thus, I believe my being here is in the wi&s;dom of Chri&s;t, I know not as to life or death.</P>
<P>About a quarter before &s;ix the &s;ame morn|ing he &s;eemed to fall into an ea&s;y &s;leep, which continued about half an hour, when &s;eeming to awake, he breathed a few times with more difficulty, and expired without &s;igh, groan, or &s;truggle.</P>

<P>CUSTOMS <HI>generally approved, and</HI> opi|nions <HI>received by youth from their &s;upe|riors, become like the natural produce of a &s;oil, e&s;pecially when they are &s;uited to favourite in|clinations: but as the judgments of God are without partiality, by which the &s;tate of the &s;oul mu&s;t be tried, it would be the highe&s;t wi&s;|dom to forego cu&s;toms and popular opinions, and try the trea&s;ures of the &s;oul by the infallible &s;tandard</HI> truth.</P>
<P>Natural affection <HI>needs a careful examina|tion: operating upon us in a &s;oft manner,</HI> it <HI>kin|dles de&s;ires of love and tenderne&s;s, and there is danger of taking it for &s;omething higher. To

me it appears an in&s;tinct like that which inferior creatures have; each of them, we &s;ee, by the ties of nature, love</HI> &s;elf <HI>be&s;t; that which is a part of</HI> &s;elf, <HI>they love by the &s;ame tie or in|&s;tinct. In them it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, does the of|fices of rea&s;on, by which, among other things, they watchfully keep, and orderly feed their helple&s;s offspring. Thus</HI> natural affection <HI>ap|pears to be a branch of</HI> &s;elf-love, <HI>good in the animal race, in us likewi&s;e, with proper limita|tions; but otherwi&s;e is productive of evil, by exciting de&s;ires to promote</HI> &s;ome <HI>by means preju|dicial to</HI> others.</P>
<P><HI>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;eems to give a check to this irregular fondne&s;s in nature, and, at the &s;ame time, a precedent for us:</HI> <Q>Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</Q> <HI>there|by intimating, that the earthly ties of relation|&s;hip, are, comparatively, incon&s;iderable to &s;uch, who, thro' a &s;teady cour&s;e of obedience, have come to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> happy experience of the &s;pirit of God hearing witne&s;s with their &s;pirits that they are his children:</HI>&mdash;<Q>And he &s;tretched forth his hands towards his di&s;ciples, and &s;aid, Behold my mother, and my brethren: For who&s;oever &s;hall do the will of my Fa|ther which is in heaven (<HI>arrives at the more noble part of true relation&s;hip</HI>)</Q> <Q>the &s;ame is my brother, and &s;i&s;ter, and mother,</Q> <HI>Matt.</HI> xii. 48.</P>
<P><HI>This doctrine agrees well with a &s;tate truly compleat, where</HI> love <HI>nece&s;&s;arily operates ac|cording

to the agreeablene&s;s of things on princi|ples unalterable and in them&s;elves perfect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If endeavouring to have my children eminent among&s;t men after my death, be that which no rea&s;ons grounded on tho&s;e principles can be brought to &s;upport; then to be temperate in my pur&s;uit after gain, and to keep always within the bounds of tho&s;e principles, is an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, and to depart from it, a dark unfruitful toil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In our pre&s;ent condition, to</HI> love <HI>our children is needful; but except this</HI> love <HI>proceeds from the true heavenly principle which &s;ees beyond earthly trea&s;ures, it will rather be injurious than of any real advantage to them: where the fountain is corrupt, the &s;treams mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be impure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That important injunction of our Saviour, Matt.</HI> vi. 33. <HI>with the Promi&s;e annexed, con|tains a &s;hort but comprehen&s;ive view of our du|ty and happine&s;s:&mdash;If then the bu&s;ine&s;s of man|kind in this life, is, to fir&s;t &s;eek another; if this cannot be done, but by attending to the means; if a &s;ummary of the means is,</HI> Not to do that to another which, in like circum&s;tances, we would not have done unto us, <HI>then the&s;e are points of moment, and worthy of our mo&s;t &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What I write on this &s;ubject is with reluct|ance, and the hints given are in as general terms as my concern would allow: I know it is a point about which, in all its branches, men that appear to aim well are not generally a|greed;

When we remember that all nations are of one blood, Gen iii. 20. that in this world we are but &s;ojourners, that we are &s;ubject to the like afflictions and infirmities of body, the like di&s;orders and frailties in mind, the like temptations, the &s;ame death, and the &s;ame judgment, and, that the all-wi&s;e Being is Judge and Lord over us all, it &s;eems to rai&s;e an idea of a general brotherhood, and a di&s;|po&s;ition ea&s;y to be touched with a feeling of each others afflictions: but when we forget tho&s;e things, and look chiefly at our out|ward circum&s;tances, in this and &s;ome ages pa&s;t, con&s;tantly retaining in our minds the di&s;tinction betwixt us and them, with re|&s;pect to our knowledge and improvement in things divine, natural and artificial, our brea&s;ts being apt to be filled with fond no|tions of &s;uperiority, there is danger of err|ing in our conduct toward them.</P>

them carefully to in&s;pect their ways, and con&s;ider the purpo&s;es for which tho&s;e favours were be&s;towed, le&s;t, thro' forgetful|ne&s;s of God, and mi&s;u&s;ing his gifts, they in|cur his heavy di&s;plea&s;ure, who&s;e judgments are ju&s;t and equal, who exalteth and hum|bleth to the du&s;t as he &s;eeth meet.</P>
<P>It appears, by Holy Record, that men un|der high favours have been apt to err in their opinions concerning others. Thus I&s;rael, ac|cording to the de&s;cription of the prophet, I&s;a. lxv. 5. when exceedingly corrupted and degenerated, yet remembered they were the cho&s;en people of God; and could &s;ay, <Q>Stand by thy&s;elf, come not near me, for I am ho|lier than thou.</Q> That this was no chance language, but their common opinion of other people, more fully appears, by con&s;idering the circum&s;tances which attended when God was beginning to fulfil his precious promi&s;es concerning the gathering of the Gentiles.</P>
<P>The Mo&s;t-High, in a vi&s;ion, undeceived Peter, fir&s;t prepared his heart to believe; and, at the hou&s;e of Cornelius, &s;hewed him of a certainty that God was no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The effu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t upon a people, with whom they, the Jewi&s;h chri&s;|tians would not &s;o much as eat, was &s;trange to them: All they of the circumci&s;ion were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee it; and the apo&s;tles and bre|thren of Judea contended with Peter about it, till he, having rehear&s;ed the whole mat|ter, and fully &s;hewn that the Father's love
<PB N="260" REF="013782_0273_0F91B527678F6D18">
was unlimited, they are thereat &s;truck with admiration, and cry out, <Q>Then hath God al&s;o to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life!</Q></P>
<P>The opinion of peculiar favours being con|fined to them, was deeply rooted, or el&s;e the above in&s;tance had been le&s;s &s;trange to them, for the&s;e rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, They were generally acquainted with the writings of the pro|phets, by whom this time was repeatedly &s;poken of, and pointed at. Secondly, Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;hortly before expre&s;ly &s;aid, <Q>I have other &s;heep, not of this fold, them al&s;o mu&s;t I bring,</Q> &amp;c. La&s;tly, His words to them after his re&s;urrection, at the very time of his a&s;cen&s;ion, <Q>Ye &s;hall be witne&s;&s;es to me, not only in Jeru&s;alem, Judea, and Samaria, but to the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth.</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e concurring circum&s;tances, one would think, might have rai&s;ed a &s;trong expectation of &s;eeing &s;uch a time; yet, when it came, it proved matter of offence and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider mankind otherwi&s;e than bre|thren, to think favours are peculiar to one nation, and exclude others, plainly &s;uppo&s;es a darkne&s;s in the under&s;tanding: for as God's love is univer&s;al, &s;o where the mind is &s;uf|ficiently influenced by it, it begets a likene&s;s of it&s;elf, and the heart is enlarged towards all men. Again, to conclude a people fro|ward, perver&s;e, and wor&s;e by nature than others (who ungratefully receive favours, and apply them to bad ends) this will excite
<PB N="261" REF="013782_0274_0F91B52A991EA618">
a behaviour toward them unbecoming the excellence of true religion.</P>
<P>To prevent &s;uch error, let us calmly con&s;i|der their circum&s;tance; and, the better to do it, make their ca&s;e ours. Suppo&s;e, then, that our ance&s;tors and we had been expo&s;ed to con&s;tant &s;ervitude, in the more &s;ervile and inferior employments of life; that we had been de&s;titute of the help of reading and good company; that among&s;t our&s;elves we had had few wi&s;e and pious in&s;tructors; that the religious among&s;t our &s;uperiors &s;eldom took notice of us; that while others, in ea&s;e, have plentifully heaped up the fruit of our labour, we had received barely enough to re|lieve nature; and being wholly at the com|mand of others, had generally been treated as a contemptible, ignorant part of man|kind: &s;hould we, in that ca&s;e, be le&s;s abject than they now are? Again, If oppre&s;&s;ion be &s;o hard to bear, that a wi&s;e man is made mad by it, Eccl. vii. 7. then a &s;eries of tho&s;e things altering the behaviour and manners of a people, is what may rea&s;onably be ex|pected.</P>
<P>When our property is taken contrary to our mind, by means appearing to us unju&s;t, it is only through divine influence, and the enlargement of heart from thence proceed|ing, that we can love our reputed oppre&s;|&s;ors: if the Negroes fall &s;hort in this, an unea&s;y, if not a di&s;con&s;olate di&s;po&s;ition, will be awakened, and remain like &s;eeds in their minds, producing &s;loth and many other ha|bits

appearing odious to us; with which, be|ing free men, they, perhaps, had not been chargeable. The&s;e, and other circum&s;tances, rightly con&s;idered, will le&s;&s;en that too great di&s;parity, which &s;ome make between us and them.</P>
<P>Integrity of heart hath appeared in &s;ome of them; &s;o that, if we continue in the word of Chri&s;t (previous to di&s;ciple&s;hip, John viii. 31.) and our conduct towards them be &s;ea|&s;oned with his love, we may hope to &s;ee the good effect of it: the which, in a good de|gree, is the ca&s;e with &s;ome into who&s;e hands they have fallen: but that too many treat them otherwi&s;e, not &s;eeming con&s;cious of any neglect, is, alas! too evident.</P>
<P>When &s;elf-love pre&s;ides in our minds, our opinions are bia&s;&s;ed in our own favour; in this condition, being concerned with a peo|ple &s;o &s;ituated, that they have no voice to plead their own cau&s;e, there's danger of u&s;|ing our&s;elves to an undi&s;turbed partiality, till, by long cu&s;tom, the mind becomes re|conciled with it, and the judgment it&s;elf in|fected.</P>
<P>To humbly apply to God for wi&s;dom, that we may thereby be enabled to &s;ee things as they are, and ought to be, is very needful; hereby the hidden things of darkne&s;s may be brought to light, and the judgment made clear: we &s;hall then con&s;ider mankind as bre|thren. Though different degrees and a vari|ety of qualifications and abilities, one de|pendant on another, be admitted, yet high

<P>"He hath laid down the be&s;t criterion, by which mankind ought to judge of their own conduct, and others judge for them of theirs, one towards another, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>What|&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them.</Q> I take it, that all men by nature, are equally entitled to the equity of this rule, and under the in|di&s;pen&s;able obligations of it. One man ought not to look upon another man, or &s;ociety of men, as &s;o far beneath him; but that he &s;hould put him&s;elf in their place, in all his actions towards them, and bring all to this te&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> How &s;hould I approve of this con|duct, were I in their circum&s;tance, and they in mine?"

<P>This doctrine being of a moral unchange|able nature, hath been likewi&s;e inculcated in the former di&s;pen&s;ation; <Q>If a &s;tranger &s;o|journ with thee in your land, ye &s;hall not vex him; but the &s;tranger that dwelleth with you, &s;hall be as one born among&s;t you, and thou &s;halt love him as thy&s;elf,</Q> Lev. xix. 33, 34. Had the&s;e people come vo|luntary and dwelt among&s;t us, to have called them &s;trangers would be proper; and their being brought by force, with regret, and a langui&s;hing mind, may well rai&s;e compa&s;&s;ion in a heart rightly di&s;po&s;ed: but there is no|thing in &s;uch treatment, which upon a wi&s;e

and judicious con&s;ideration, will any ways le&s;&s;en their right of being treated as &s;tran|gers. If the treatment which many of them meet with, be rightly examined and com|pared with tho&s;e precepts, <Q>Thou &s;halt not vex him nor oppre&s;s him; he &s;hall be as one born among&s;t you, and thou &s;halt love him as thy&s;elf,</Q> Lev. xix. 33.

<P>It may be objected there is co&s;t of pur|cha&s;e, and ri&s;que of their lives to them who po&s;&s;e&s;s 'em, and therefore needful that they make the be&s;t u&s;e of their time: in a prac|tice ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, &s;uch objections may have weight; but if the work be wrong from the beginning, there is little or no force in them. If I purcha&s;e a man who hath never forfeited his liberty, the natural right of freedom is in him; and &s;hall I keep him and his po&s;terity in &s;ervitude and ignorance? "How &s;hould I approve of this conduct, were I in his circum&s;tances, and he in mine?" It may be thought, that to treat them as we would willingly be treated, our gain by them would be incon&s;iderable: and it were, in di|vers re&s;pects, better that there were none in our country.</P>
<P>We may further con&s;ider, that they are now among&s;t us, and tho&s;e of our nation the cau&s;e of their being here; that what&s;oever difficulty accrues thereon, we are ju&s;tly chargeable with, and to bear all inconveni|encies attending it, with a &s;erious and weigh|ty

<P>David, in a great &s;trait, when the &s;en&s;e of his pa&s;t error, and the full expectation of an impending calamity, as the reward of it, were united to the aggravating his di&s;tre&s;s, after &s;ome deliberation, &s;aith, <Q>Let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for very great are his mercies; let me not fall in|to the hand of man.</Q> 1 Chron. xxi. 13.</P>
<P>To act continually with integrity of heart, above all narrow or &s;elfi&s;h motives, is a &s;ure token of our being partakers of that &s;alva|tion which <Q>God hath appointed for walls and bulwarks,</Q> I&s;a. v. 26.

The&s;e rea|dily overlook the true happine&s;s of man, as it re&s;ults from the enjoyment of all things in the fear of God, and, mi&s;erably &s;ub&s;tituting an inferior good, dangerous in the acquir|ing, and uncertain in the fruition, they are &s;ubject to many di&s;appointments, and every &s;weet carries its &s;ting.</P>
<P>It is the conclu&s;ion of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and his apo&s;tles, as appears by their lives and doctrines, that the highe&s;t delights of &s;en&s;e, or mo&s;t plea&s;ing objects vi&s;ible, ought ever to be accounted infinitely inferior to that real intellectual happine&s;s &s;uited to man in his primitive innocence, and now to be found in true renovation of mind; and that the com|forts of our pre&s;ent life, the things mo&s;t grateful to us, ought always to be received with temperance, and never made the chief objects of our de&s;ire, hope, or love: but that
<PB N="267" REF="013782_0280_0F91B52EE2098FE0">
our whole heart and affections be principally looking to that <Q>city, which hath founda|tions, who&s;e maker and builder is God.</Q> Did we &s;o improve the gifts be&s;towed on us, that our children might have an education &s;uited to the&s;e doctrines, and our example to confirm it, we might rejoice in hopes of their being heirs of an inheritance incorruptible.</P>
<P>This inheritance, as chri&s;tians, we e&s;teem the mo&s;t valuable; and how then can we fail to de&s;ire it for our children? O that we were con&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves, in pur&s;uing means nece&s;&s;ary to obtain it!</P>
<P>It appears, by experience, that where chil|dren are educated in fulne&s;s, ea&s;e and idle|ne&s;s, evil habits are more prevalent, than in common among&s;t &s;uch who are prudently employed in the nece&s;&s;ary affairs of life: and if children are not only educated in the way of &s;o great temptation, but have al&s;o the op|portunity of lording it over their fellow-creatures, and being ma&s;ters of men in their childhood, how can we hope otherwi&s;e than that their tender minds will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with thoughts too high for them? which, by con|tinuance, gaining &s;trength, will prove, like a &s;low current, gradually &s;eparating them from (or keeping from acquaintance with) that humility and meekne&s;s in which alone la&s;ting happine&s;s can be enjoyed.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALL our actions are of like nature with their root; and the Mo&s;t High weigheth them more &s;kilfully than Men can weigh them one for another,</HI></P>
<P><HI>I believe that one Supreme Being made and &s;upports the world; nor can I wor&s;hip any other Deity without being an idolater, and guilty of wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="013782_0289_0F91B537F4752748">
<HI>Many nations have believed in, and wor&s;hip|ped a plurality of deities; but I do not believe they were therefore all wicked. Idolatry indeed is wickedne&s;s; but it is the thing, not the name, which is &s;o. Real idolatry is to pay that ado|ration to a creature, which is known to be due only to the true God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He who profe&s;&s;eth to believe one Almighty Creator, and in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and is yet more intent on the honours, profits and friend|&s;hips of the world, than he is in &s;inglene&s;s of heart to</HI> &s;tand faithful to the chri&s;tian religion, <HI>is in the channel of idolatry; while the</HI> Gentile, <HI>who, under &s;ome mi&s;taken opinions, is notwith|&s;tanding e&s;tabli&s;hed in the true principle of vir|tue, and humbly adores and almighty power, may be of that number who fear God, and work righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I believe the bi&s;hop of Rome a&s;&s;umes a power, that does not belong to any officer in the church of Chri&s;t; and if I &s;hould knowingly do any thing, tending to &s;trengthen him in that capa|city, it would be great iniquity. There are ma|ny thou&s;ands of people, who by their profe&s;&s;ion acknowledge him to be the repre&s;entative of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t on earth; and to &s;ay that none of them are upright in heart, would be contrary to my &s;entiments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Men who &s;incerely apply their minds to true virtue, and find an inward &s;upport from above, by which all vicious inclinations are made &s;ub|ject; that they love God &s;incerely, and prefer the real good of mankind univer&s;ally to their
<PB N="277" REF="013782_0290_0F91B539EDBAFC48">
own private intere&s;t; though the&s;e, through the &s;trength of education and tradition, may remain under &s;ome &s;peculative and great errors, it would be uncharitable to &s;ay, that therefore God rejects them.&mdash;He who creates, &s;upports and gives un|der&s;tanding to all men, his knowledge and good|ne&s;s is &s;uperior to the various ca&s;es and circum|&s;tances of his creatures, which to us appear the mo&s;t difficult.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians did not cen&s;ure all the Gentiles as wicked men, Rom.</HI> ii. 14. <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 11. <HI>but as they were favoured with a gift to di&s;cern things more clearly, re&s;pecting the wor&s;hip of the true God, they with much firmne&s;s declared again&s;t the wor&s;hipping of I|dols; and with true patience endured many &s;uf|ferings, on that account.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Great numbers of faithful Prote&s;tants have contended for the truth, in oppo&s;ition to</HI> papal <HI>errors; and with true fortitude laid down their lives in the conflict, without &s;aying, That no man was &s;aved who made profe&s;&s;ion of that re|ligion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>While we have no right to keep men as &s;er|vants for term of life, but that of &s;uperior pow|er; to do this, with de&s;ign by their labour to profit our&s;elves and our families, I believe is wrong; but I do not believe that all who have kept &s;laves, have therefore been chargeable with guilt. If their motives thereto were free from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and their &s;laves content, they were a &s;ort of freemen; which I believe hath &s;ome|times been the ca&s;e.</HI></P>

<HI>Whatever a man does in the &s;ptiri of charity, to him it is not &s;in: and while be lives and acts in this &s;pirit, he learns all things e&s;&s;ential to his happine&s;s, as an individual: and if he doth not &s;ee that any injury or inju&s;tice, to any other per|&s;on, is nece&s;&s;arily promoted by any part of his form of government, I believe the merciful Judge will not lay iniquity to his charge. Yet others, who live in the &s;ame &s;pirit of charity, from a clear convincement, may &s;ee the relation of one thing to another, and the nece&s;&s;ary ten|dency of each; and hence it may be ab&s;olutely binding on them to de&s;i&s;t from &s;ome parts of con|duct, which &s;ome good men have been in.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS On the KEEPING of NEGROES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART the SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;ome in mo&s;t religious &s;ocieties a|mong&s;t the Engli&s;h are concerned in importing or purcha&s;ing the inhabi|tants of Africa as &s;laves; and as the profe&s;|&s;ors of chri&s;tianity of &s;everal other nations do the like; the&s;e circum&s;tances tend to make people le&s;s apt to examine the practice &s;o clo&s;ely as they would, if &s;uch a thing had not been, but was now propo&s;ed to be en|tered upon. It is however our duty, and what concerns us individually, as creatures accountable to our Creator, to employ right|ly the under&s;tanding which he hath given us, in humbly endeavouring to be acquaint|ed with his will concerning us, and with the nature and tendency of tho&s;e things which we practi&s;e: for as ju&s;tice remains to be ju&s;|tice, &s;o many people, of reputation in the
<PB N="280" REF="013782_0293_0F91B53D1A636EA0">
world, joining with wrong things, do not excu&s;e others in joining with them, nor make the con&s;equence of their proceedings le&s;s dreadful in the final i&s;&s;ue, than it would be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Where unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is ju&s;tified from one age to another, it is like dark matter gathering into clouds over us. We may know that this gloom will remain till the cau&s;e be removed by a reformation, or change of times; and may feel a de&s;ire, from a love of equity, to &s;peak on the occa&s;ion; yet where error is &s;o &s;trong, that it may not be &s;poken again&s;t, without &s;ome pro&s;pect of inconvenience to the &s;peaker, this difficulty is likely to operate on our weakne&s;s, and quench the good de&s;ires in us; except we dwell &s;o &s;teadily under the weight of it, as to be made willing to "endure hardne&s;s" on that account.</P>
<P>Where men exert their talents again&s;t vices generally accounted &s;uch, the ill effects whereof are pre&s;ently perceived in a govern|ment, all men who regard their own tempo|ral good, are likely to approve the work. But when that which is incon&s;i&s;tent with perfect equity, hath the law, or countenance of the great in its favour, though the ten|dency thereof be quite contrary to the true happine&s;s of mankind in an equal, if not greater, degree, than many things account|ed reproachful to chri&s;tians; yet, as the&s;e ill effects are not generally perceived, they who labour to di&s;&s;uade from &s;uch things, which
<PB N="281" REF="013782_0294_0F91B53E847B08A0">
people believe accord with their intere&s;t, have many difficulties to encounter.</P>
<P>The repeated charges, which God gave to his prophets, imply the danger they were in of erring on this Hand. <Q>Be not afraid of their faces; for I am with thee, to deliver thee, &s;aith the Lord. Jer. i. 8. Speak all the words that I command thee to &s;peak to them; dimini&s;h not a word.</Q> Jer. xxvi. 2. <Q>And thou, &s;on of man, be not afraid of them, nor di&s;mayed at their looks. Speak my words to them, whether they will hear or forbear.</Q> Ezek. ii. 6, 7.</P>
<P>Under an apprehen&s;ion of duty, I offer &s;ome further con&s;iderations on this &s;ubject, having endeavoured &s;ome years to con&s;ider it candidly. I have ob&s;erved people of our own colour, who&s;e abilities have been infe|rior to the affairs which relate to their con|venient &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, who have been taken care of by others, and the profit of &s;uch work as they could do, applied toward their &s;upport.&mdash;I believe there are &s;uch among&s;t negroes; and that &s;ome people, in who&s;e hands they are, keep them with no view of outward profit, do not con&s;ider them as black men, who, as &s;uch, ought to &s;erve white men; but account them per&s;ons who have need of guardians, and as &s;uch take care of them: yet where equal care is taken in all parts of education, I do not apprehend ca&s;es of this &s;ort are likely to occur more frequent|ly among&s;t one &s;ort of people than another.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="013782_0295_0F91B54081849490">
It looks to me that the &s;lave trade was founded, and hath generally been carried on, in a wrong &s;pirit; that the effects of it are detrimental to the real pro&s;perity of our country; and will be more &s;o, except we cea&s;e from the common motives of keeping them, and treat them in future agreeable to truth and pure ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Negroes may be imported, who, for their cruelty to their countrymen, and the evil di&s;po&s;ition of their minds, may be unfit to be at liberty; and if we, as lovers of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, undertake the management of them, we &s;hould have a full and clear knowledge of their crimes, and of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which might operate in their favour; but the diffi|culty of obtaining this is &s;o great, that we have great rea&s;on to be cautious therein. But, &s;hould it plainly appear that ab&s;olute &s;ubjection was a condition the mo&s;t proper for the per&s;on who is purcha&s;ed, yet the in|nocent children ought not to be made &s;laves, becau&s;e their parents &s;inned.</P>
<P>We have account in holy &s;cripture of &s;ome families &s;uffering, where mention is only made of the heads of the family committing wick|edne&s;s; and it is likely that the degenerate Jews, mi&s;under&s;tanding &s;ome occurrences of this kind, took occa&s;ion to charge God with being unequal; &s;o that a &s;aying became com|mon, <Q>The Fathers have eaten four grapes, and the children's teeth are &s;et on edge.</Q> Jeremiah and Ezekiel, two of the in&s;pired prophets, who lived near the &s;ame time, were
<PB N="283" REF="013782_0296_0F91B541B25B0978">
concerned to correct this error. Ezekiel is large on the &s;ubject. Fir&s;t, he reproves them for their error. <Q>What mean ye, that ye do &s;o, chap. xviii. ver&s;e 2. As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, ye &s;hall not have oc|ca&s;ion any more to u&s;e this proverb in I&s;|rael.</Q> The words, "any more," have reference to time pa&s;t; intimating, that tho' they had not rightly under&s;tood &s;ome things they had heard or &s;een, and thence &s;uppo&s;ed the proverb to be well grounded; yet hence|forth they might know of a certainty, that the ways of God are all equal; that as &s;ure as the Mo&s;t High liveth, &s;o &s;ure men are on|ly an&s;werable for their own &s;ins.&mdash;He thus &s;ums up the matter, ver. 20. <Q>The &s;oul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die. The &s;on &s;hall not bear the iniquity of the father; neither &s;hall the father bear the iniquity of the &s;on. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righteous &s;hall be up|on him; and the wickedne&s;s of the wicked &s;hall be upon him.</Q></P>
<P>Where men are wicked, they commonly are a means of corrupting the &s;ucceeding age; and thereby ha&s;ten tho&s;e outward calamities, which fall on nations, when their iniquities are full.</P>
<P>Men may pur&s;ue means which are not a|greeable to perfect purity, with a view to in|crea&s;e the wealth and happine&s;s of their off|&s;pring, and thereby make the way of virtue more difficult to them. And though the ill example of a parent, or a multitude, does not excu&s;e a man in doing evil, yet the mind be|ing
<PB N="284" REF="013782_0297_0F91B3DF623CC158">
early impre&s;&s;ed with vicious notions and practices, and nurtured up in ways of get|ting trea&s;ure, which are not the ways of truth; this wrong &s;pirit getting fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on, and being thus &s;trengthened, frequently prevents due attention to the true &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, &s;o that they exceed in wickedne&s;s tho&s;e who lived before them. And in this channel, though parents labour, as they think, to for|ward the happine&s;s of their children, it proves a means of forwarding their calamity. This being the ca&s;e in the age next before the grievous calamity in the &s;iege of Jeru&s;alem, and carrying Judah captive to Babylon, they might &s;ay with propriety, This came upon us, be|cau&s;e our fathers for&s;ook God, and becau&s;e we did wor&s;e than our fathers. See Jer. vii. 26.</P>
<P>As the generation next before them inward|ly turned away from God, who yet waited to be gracious; and as they in that age conti|nued in tho&s;e things which nece&s;&s;arily &s;epa|rated from perfect goodne&s;s, growing more &s;tubborn, till the judgments of God were poured out upon them; they might properly &s;ay, <Q>Our fathers have &s;inned, and we have borne their iniquities:</Q> Lam. v. 7. And yet, wicked as their fathers were, had they not &s;ucceeded them in their wickedne&s;s, they had not borne their iniquities.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e it right, that an innocent man &s;hall at this day be excluded from the com|mon rules of ju&s;tice; be deprived of that li|berty, which is the natural right of human creatures; and be a &s;lave to others during
<PB N="285" REF="013782_0298_0F91B3DFA019D1B8">
life, on account of a &s;in committed by his immediate parents; or a &s;in committed by Ham, the &s;on of Noah; is a &s;uppo&s;ition too gro&s;s to be admitted into the mind of any per&s;on, who &s;incerely de&s;ires to be governed by &s;olid principles.</P>
<P>It is alledged, in favour of the practice, that Jo&s;hua made &s;laves of the Gibeonites.</P>
<P>What men do by the command of God, and what comes to pa&s;s as a con&s;equence of their neglect, are different; &s;uch as the latter ca&s;e now mentioned was.</P>
<P>It was the expre&s;s command of the Almigh|ty to I&s;rael, concerning the inhabitants of the promi&s;ed land, <Q>Thou &s;halt make no covenant with them, nor with their Gods: They &s;hall not dwell in thy land,</Q> Exod. xxiii. 32. Tho&s;e Gibeonites came craftily, telling Jo&s;hua, that they were come from a far country; that their elders had &s;ent them to make a league with the people of I&s;rael; and as an evidence of their being foreigners, &s;hewed their old cloaths, &amp;c. <Q>And the men took of their victuals, and a&s;ked not coun&s;el at the mouth of the Lord; and Jo&s;hua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live; and the princes &s;ware to them.</Q> Jo&s;h. xcvi. 14, 15.</P>
<P>When the impo&s;ition was di&s;covered, the congregation murmured again&s;t the princes: <Q>But all the princes &s;aid to all the congrega|tion, we have &s;worn to them by the Lord God of I&s;rael; now therefore we may not touch them; we will even let them live,
<PB N="286" REF="013782_0299_0F91B3E06430C928">
le&s;t wrath be upon us; but let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water un|to the congregation.</Q></P>
<P>Omitting to a&s;k coun&s;el, involved them in great difficulty. The Gibeonites were of tho&s;e cities, of which the Lord &s;aid, <Q>Thou &s;halt &s;ave alive nothing that breatheth;</Q> and of the &s;tock of the Hivites, concerning whom he commanded by name, <Q>Thou &s;halt &s;mite them, and utterly de&s;troy them: Thou &s;halt make no covenant with them, nor &s;hew mercy unto them,</Q> Deut. vii. 1. Thus Jo&s;hua and the princes, not knowing them, had made a league with them, to let them live; and in this &s;trait they re&s;olve to make them &s;ervants. Jo&s;hua and the princes &s;u&s;|pected them to be deceivers: <Q>Peradventure you dwell among&s;t us: and how &s;hall we make a league with you?</Q> Which words &s;hew, that they remembered the command before mentioned; and yet did not enquire at the mouth of the Lord, as Mo&s;es directed Jo&s;hua, when he gave him a charge re&s;pect|ing his duty as chief man among that people, Numb. xxvii. 21. By this omi&s;&s;ion things became &s;o &s;ituated, that Jo&s;hua and the princes could not execute the judgments of God on them, without violating the oath which they had made.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es did ami&s;s at the waters of Meribah; and doubtle&s;s he &s;oon repented; for the Lord was with him. And it is likely that Jo&s;hua was deeply humbled, under a &s;en&s;e of his omi&s;&s;ion; for it appears that God continued
<PB N="287" REF="013782_0300_0F91B3E1212DA318">
him in his office, and &s;pared the lives of tho&s;e people, for the &s;ake of the league and oath made in his name.</P>
<P>The wickedne&s;s of the&s;e people was great, and they worthy to die, or perfect ju&s;tice had not pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence of death upon them; and as their execution was prevented by this league and oath, they appear content to be &s;ervants: <Q>As it &s;eemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e criminals, in&s;tead of death, had the &s;entence of &s;ervitude pronounced on them, in the&s;e words, <Q>Now therefore ye are cur&s;ed; and there &s;hall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the hou&s;e of my God.</Q></P>
<P>We find, Deut. xx. 10. that there were cities far di&s;tant from Canaan, again&s;t which I&s;rael went to battle; unto whom they were to proclaim peace, and if the inhabitants made an&s;wer of peace, and opened their gates, they were not to de&s;troy them, but make them tributaries.</P>
<P>The children of I&s;rael were then the Lord's ho&s;t, and executioners of his judgments on people hardened in wickedne&s;s.&mdash;They were not to go to battle, but by his appointment. The men who were chief in his army, had their in&s;tructions from the Almighty; &s;ome|times immediately, and &s;ometimes by the mini&s;try of angels. Of the&s;e, among&s;t others, were Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Othniel, and Gideon; &s;ee Exod. iii. 2. and xviii. 19. Jo&s;h. v. 13.
<PB N="288" REF="013782_0301_0F91B3E1EBF38A88">
The&s;e people far off from Canaan, again&s;t whom I&s;rael was &s;ent to battle, were &s;o cor|rupt, that the creator of the univer&s;e &s;aw it good to change their &s;ituation; and in ca&s;e of their opening their gates, and coming un|der tribute, this their &s;ubjection, though pro|bably more mild than ab&s;olute &s;lavery, was to la&s;t little or no longer than while I&s;rael re|mained in the true &s;pirit of government.</P>
<P>It was pronounced by Mo&s;es the prophet, as a con&s;equence of their wickedne&s;s, <Q>The &s;tranger that is within thee &s;hall get above thee very high; and thou &s;halt come down very low: he &s;hall be the head, and thou the tail.</Q> Deut. xxviii. 43, 44.</P>
<P>This we find in &s;ome mea&s;ure verified in their being made tributaries to the Moabites, Midianites, Amorites and Phili&s;tines.</P>
<P>It is alledged in favour of the practice of &s;lave-keeping, that the Jews by their law made &s;laves of the Heathen, Levit. xxv. 45. <Q>Moreover, of the children of the &s;trangers that do &s;ojourn among&s;t you, of them &s;hall ye buy, and of their children, which are with you, which they begat in your land; and they &s;hall be your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and you &s;hall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they &s;hall be your bondmen for ever.</Q>&mdash;It is difficult for us to have any certain knowledge of the mind of Mo&s;es, in regard to keeping &s;laves, any other way than by looking upon him as a true &s;ervant of God, who&s;e mind and conduct were regulated by
<PB N="289" REF="013782_0302_0F91B3E2C1E1FEA0">
an inward principle of ju&s;tice and equity. To admit a &s;uppo&s;ition that he in that ca&s;e was drawn from perfect equity by the alliance of outward kindred, would be to di&s;own his au|thority.</P>
<P>Abraham had &s;ervants born in his hou&s;e, and bought with his money: <Q>And the Al|mighty &s;aid of Abraham, I know him, that he will order his hou&s;e after him.</Q> Which implies, that he was as a father, an in&s;tructor, and a good governor over his peo|ple.&mdash;And Mo&s;es, con&s;idered as a man of God, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have had a pro&s;pect of &s;ome real advantage in the &s;trangers and hea|thens being &s;ervants to the I&s;raelites for a time.</P>
<P>As mankind had received and e&s;tabli&s;hed many erroneous opinions and hurtful cu&s;|toms, their living and conver&s;ing with the Jews, while the Jews &s;tood faithful to their principles, might be helpful to remove tho&s;e errors, and reform their manners.&mdash;But for men, with private views, to a&s;&s;ume an ab&s;olute power over the per&s;ons and proper|ties of others; and continue it from age to age in the line of natural generation, with|out regard to the virtues and vices of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as it is manife&s;tly contrary to true univer&s;al love, and attended with great evils, there requires the cleare&s;t evidence to beget a belief in us, that Mo&s;es intended that the &s;trangers &s;hould as &s;uch be &s;laves to the Jews.</P>

<P>George Buchanan, in his hi&s;tory of Scot|land, page 62, tells of &s;ome ancient inhabi|tants of Britain, who were derived from a people that "had a way of marking their bodies, as &s;ome &s;aid, with in&s;truments of iron, with variety of pictures, and with ani|mals of all &s;hapes, and wear no garments, that they &s;hould not hide their pictures; and were therefore called Picts."</P>
<P>Did we &s;ee tho&s;e people &s;hrink with pain, for a con&s;iderable time together, under the point or edge of this iron in&s;trument, and their bodies all bloody with the operation; did we &s;ee them &s;ometimes naked, &s;uffering with cold, and refu&s;e to put on garments, that tho&s;e imaginary en&s;igns of grandeur might not be concealed, it is likely we &s;hould pity their folly, and fondne&s;s for tho&s;e things: but if we candidly compare their conduct, in that ca&s;e, with &s;ome conduct among&s;t our&s;elves, will it not appear that our folly is the greate&s;t?</P>
<P>In true go&s;pel &s;implicity, free from all wrong u&s;e of things, a &s;pirit which breathes peace and good will is cheri&s;hed; but when we a&s;pire after imaginary grandeur, and ap|ply to &s;elfi&s;h means to attain our end, this de&s;ire, in its original, is the &s;ame with the Picts in cutting figures on their bodies; but

I afterwards told him, I came not into his country to make &s;laves; but rather to deliver tho&s;e from the &s;lavery of the devil, whom he kept in mi&s;erable thraldom. The &s;hip I went aboard was loaded with elephants teeth, and &s;laves, to the number of &s;ix hun|dred and eighty men, women and children. It was a pitiful &s;ight to behold how all the&s;e people were be&s;towed. The men were &s;tand|ing in the hold, fa&s;tened one to another with &s;takes, for fear they &s;hould ri&s;e and kill the whites: the women were between the decks, and tho&s;e that were with child in the great cabbin: the children in the &s;teerage, pre&s;&s;ed together like herrings in a barrel; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">h cau&s;ed an intolerable heat and &s;tench."

<P>"It is now time (&s;aith the &s;ame author) to &s;peak of a bruti&s;h cu&s;tom the&s;e people have among&s;t them in making &s;laves; which I take not to be lawful for any per&s;on of a good con&s;cience to buy."&mdash;</P>

<P>The author of this treati&s;e, conver&s;ing with a per&s;on of good credit, was informed by him, that in his youth, while in England, he was minded to come to America, and happening on a ve&s;&s;el bound for Guinea, and from thence into America, he, with a view to &s;ee Africa, went on board her, and continued with them in their voyage, and &s;o came into this country. Among other circum&s;tances he related the&s;e. "They purcha&s;ed on the coa&s;t about three hundred &s;laves; &s;ome of them he under&s;tood were captives of war; &s;ome &s;tolen by other Negroes privately.&mdash;When they had got many &s;laves on board, but were &s;till on that coa&s;t, a plot was laid by an old Negroe, notwith&s;tanding the men had irons on their hands and feet, to kill the Engli&s;h and take the ve&s;&s;el; which being di&s;|covered, the man was hanged, and many of the &s;laves made to &s;hoot at him as he hung up."</P>
<P>"Another &s;lave was charged with having a de&s;ign to kill the Engli&s;h; and the captain &s;poke to him in relation to the charge brought again&s;t him, as he &s;tood on deck; whereup|on he immediately threw him&s;elf into the &s;ea, and was drowned."</P>
<P>"Several Negroes, confined on board, were, he &s;aid, &s;o extremely unea&s;y with their con|dition, that after many endeavours u&s;ed, they could never make them eat nor drink

<P>In Randall's geography, printed 1744, we are informed, "That in a time of full peace nothing is more common than for the Negroes of one nation to &s;teal tho&s;e of another, and &s;ell them to the Europeans.

<P>Whatever nicety of di&s;tinction there may be, betwixt going in per&s;on on expeditions to catch &s;laves, and buying tho&s;e, with a view to &s;elf-intere&s;t, which others have taken; it is clear and plain to an upright mind, that &s;uch di&s;tinction is in words, not in &s;ub&s;tance; for the parties are concerned in the &s;ame work, and have a nece&s;&s;ary connection with, and dependance on, each other; for were there none to purcha&s;e &s;laves, they who live by &s;tealing and &s;elling them, would of con|&s;equence do le&s;s at it.</P>
<P>Some would buy a Negroe brought from Guinea, with a view to &s;elf-intere&s;t, and keep him a &s;lave, who yet would &s;eem to &s;cruple to take arms, and join with men em|ployed in taking &s;laves.</P>
<P>Others have civil Negroes, who were born in our country, capable and likely to ma|nage well for them&s;elves; whom they keep as &s;laves, without ever trying them with freedom, and take the profit of their labour as a part of their e&s;tates, and yet di&s;ap|prove bringing them from their own coun|try.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e Negroe merchants having children after their being among us, who&s;e endow|ments and conduct were like other people's in common, if on their attaining to mature age, and reque&s;ting to have their liberty, they &s;hould be told they were born in &s;lavery, and were lawful &s;laves, and therefore their reque&s;t &s;hould be denied; &s;uch conduct to|ward them, would be looked upon as unfair and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, relating to home-born Negroes, who&s;e under&s;tandings and behaviour are as good as common among other people, if we have any claim to them as &s;laves, that claim is grounded on their being the chil|dren or offspring of &s;laves, who, in general, were made &s;uch through means as unrighte|ous, and attended with more terrible circum|&s;tances than the ca&s;e la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;o that when we trace our claim to the bottom, the&s;e home-born Negroes having paid for their education, and given rea&s;onable &s;ecurity to tho&s;e who owned them, in ca&s;e of their be|coming chargeable, we have no more equit|able right to their &s;ervice, than we &s;hould if they were the children of hone&s;t merchants who came from Guinea in an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el to trade with us.</P>

It is granted by many, that the means u&s;ed in getting them are unrighteous, and that buying them, when brought here, is wrong; yet as &s;etting them free is attended with &s;ome difficulty, they do not comply with it; but &s;eem to be of the opinion, that to give them food and raiment, and keep them &s;ervants, without any other wages, is the be&s;t way to manage them that they know of: and hoping that their children after them will not be cruel to the Negroes, conclude to leave them as &s;laves to their children.</P>
<P>While pre&s;ent outward intere&s;t is the chief object of our attention, we &s;hall feel many objections in our minds again&s;t renouncing our claim to them, as the children of &s;laves; for being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with wrong opinions, prevents our &s;eeing things clearly, which, to indifferent per&s;ons, are ea&s;y to be &s;een.</P>

<P>As the conduct of men varies, relating to civil &s;ociety; &s;o different treatment is ju&s;tly due to them. Indi&s;creet men occa&s;ion trou|ble in the world; and it remains to be the care of &s;uch, who &s;eek the good of mankind, to admoni&s;h as they find occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;lothfulne&s;s of &s;ome of them, in pro|viding for them&s;elves and families, it is like|ly, would require the notice of their neigh|bours; nor is it unlikely that &s;ome would, with ju&s;tice, be made &s;ervants, and others puni&s;hed for their crimes.

<P><HI>MY mind hath often been affected with &s;or|row, on account of the prevailing of that &s;pirit, which leads from an humble waiting on the inward teaching of Chri&s;t, to pur&s;ue ways of living, attended with unnece&s;&s;ary labour, and which draws forth the minds of many peo|ple

to &s;eek after outward power, and to &s;trive for riches, which frequently introduce oppre&s;&s;ion, and bring forth wars and grievous calamities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is with reverence that I acknowledge the mercies of our heavenly Father, who, in infinite love, did vi&s;it me in my youth, and wrought a belief in me, that through true obedience a &s;tate of inward purity may be known in this life, in which we may love mankind in the &s;ame love with which our Redeemer loveth us, and there|in learn re&s;ignation to endure hard&s;hips, for the real good of others.</HI></P>

<P>TO have our tru&s;t &s;ettled in the Lord, and not to &s;eek after, nor de&s;ire out|ward trea&s;ures, any further than his holy &s;pirit leads us therein, is a happy &s;tate, as &s;aith the prophet, <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that tru&s;teth in the Lord, and who&s;e hope the Lord is.</Q></P>
<P>Pure wi&s;dom leads people into lowline&s;s of mind, in which they learn re&s;ignation to the divine will, and contentment in &s;uffering for his cau&s;e, when they cannot keep a clear con|&s;cience without &s;uffering.</P>
<P>In this pure wi&s;dom the mind is attentive to the root, and original &s;pring of motions and de&s;ires; and as we know <Q>the Lord to be our refuge,</Q> and find no &s;afety, but in humbly walking before him; we feel an holy engagement, that every de&s;ire which leads therefrom may be brought to judgment.</P>
<P>While we proceed in this precious way, and find ardent longings for a full deliverance

from every thing which defiles, all pro&s;pects of gain, that are not con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;|dom from above, are con&s;idered as &s;nares, and an inward concern is felt, that we may live under the cro&s;s, and faithfully attend to that holy &s;pirit, which is &s;ufficient to pre|&s;erve out of them.</P>
<P>When I have con&s;idered that &s;aying of Chri&s;t, Mat. vi. 19, <Q>Lay not up for your|&s;elves trea&s;ures upon earth,</Q> his omnipo|tence hath often occurred to my mind.</P>
<P>While we believe that he is every where pre&s;ent with his people, and that perfect goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom and power, are united in him, how comfortable is the con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Our wants may be great, but his power is greater. We may be oppre&s;&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;|ed, but he is able to turn our patient &s;uffer|ings into profit to our&s;elves, and to the ad|vancement of his work on earth. His people, who feel the power of his cro&s;s, to crucify all that is &s;elfi&s;h in them, who are engaged in outward concerns, from a con|vincement that it is their duty, and re&s;ign them&s;elves, and their trea&s;ures, to him; the&s;e feel that it is dangerous to give way to that in us, which craves riches and greatne&s;s in this world.</P>

<P>May we, in lowline&s;s, &s;ubmit to the lead|ings of his &s;pirit, and enter upon any out|ward employ which he graciou&s;ly points out to us, and then whatever difficulties ari&s;e, in con&s;equence of our faithfulne&s;s, I tru&s;t they will work for our good.</P>

Small trea&s;ure to a re&s;igned mind is &s;uffi|cient. How happy is it to be content with a little, to live in humility, and feel that in us, which breathes out this language, Abba! Father.</P>
<P>If that, called the wi&s;dom of this world, had no re&s;emblance of true wi&s;dom, the name of wi&s;dom, I &s;uppo&s;e, had not been given to it.</P>
<P>As wa&s;ting outward &s;ub&s;tance, to gratify vain de&s;ires, on one hand; &s;o &s;lothfulne&s;s and neglect, on the other, do often involve men and their families in trouble, and reduce them to want and di&s;tre&s;s; to &s;hun both the&s;e oppo&s;ite vices, is good in it&s;elf, and hath a re&s;emblance of wi&s;dom; but while people thus provident, have it principally in view to get riches, and power, and the friend&s;hip of this world, and do not humbly wait for the &s;pirit of truth to lead them in purity; the&s;e, through an anxious care to obtain the end de&s;ired, reach forth for gain in worldly wi&s;|dom, and, in regard to their inward &s;tate, fall into divers temptations and &s;nares. And though &s;uch may think of applying wealth to good purpo&s;es, and to u&s;e their power to prevent oppre&s;&s;ion, yet wealth and power is often applied otherwi&s;e; nor can we depart from the leadings of our holy &s;hepherd, with|out going into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Great wealth is frequently attended with power, which nothing but divine love can qualify the mind to u&s;e rightly; and as to the humility, and uprightne&s;s of our chil|dren

after us, how great is the uncertainty! If, in acquiring wealth, we take hold on the wi&s;dom which is from beneath, and depart from the leadings of truth, and example our children herein, we have great cau&s;e to ap|prehend, that wealth may be a &s;nare to them; and prove an injury to others, over whom their wealth may give them power.</P>
<P>To be redeemed from that wi&s;dom which is from beneath, and walk in the light of the Lord, is a precious &s;ituation; thus his people are brought to put their tru&s;t in him; and in this humble confidence in his wi&s;dom, good|ne&s;s and power, the righteous find a refuge in adver&s;ities, &s;uperior to the greate&s;t out|ward helps, and a comfort more certain than any worldly advantages can afford.</P>

<HEAD>ON LABOUR.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING from my childhood been u&s;ed to bodily labour for a living, I may expre&s;s my experience therein.</P>
<P>Right exerci&s;e affords an innocent plea&s;ure in the time of it, and prepares us to enjoy the &s;weetne&s;s of re&s;t; but from the extremes each way, ari&s;e inconveniences.</P>
<P>Moderate exerci&s;e opens the pores, gives the blood a lively circulation, and the better enables us to judge rightly re&s;pecting that portion of labour which is the true medium.</P>

<Q>The fowls of the air &s;ow not, nor gather into barns, yet our heavenly Father feed|eth them,</Q> Mat. vi. 26; nor do I believe that infinite goodne&s;s and power would have allotted labour to us, had he not &s;een that la|bour was proper for us in this life.</P>
<P>The original de&s;ign, and true medium of labour, is a &s;ubject, that, to me, appears worthy of our &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Idle men are often a burden to them&s;elves, neglect the duty they owe to their families, and become burden&s;ome to others al&s;o.</P>
<P>As outward labour, directed by the wi&s;|dom from above, tends to our health, and adds to our happine&s;s in this life; &s;o, on the contrary, entering upon it in a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, and pur&s;uing it too long, or too hard, hath a contrary effect.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that too much labour not only makes the under&s;tanding dull, but &s;o intrudes upon the harmony of the body, that after cea&s;ing from our toil, we have another to pa&s;s through, before we can be &s;o com|po&s;ed as to enjoy the &s;weetne&s;s of re&s;t.</P>
<P>From too much labour in the heat, fre|quently proceeds immoderate &s;weats, which do often, I believe, open the way for di&s;or|ders, and impair our con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>When we go beyond the true medium, and feel wearine&s;s approaching, but think bu&s;ine&s;s may &s;uffer if we cea&s;e, at &s;uch a time &s;pirituous liquors are frequently taken, with a view to &s;upport nature under the&s;e fatigues.</P>

I have found that too much labour in the &s;ummer heats the blood, that taking &s;trong drink to &s;upport the body under &s;uch labour, increa&s;eth that heat, and though a per&s;on may be &s;o far temperate as not to manife&s;t the lea&s;t di&s;order, yet the mind, in &s;uch a cir|cum&s;tance, doth not retain that calmne&s;s and &s;erenity, which we &s;hould endeavour to live in.</P>
<P>Thus toiling in the heat, and drinking &s;trong liquor, makes men more re&s;olute, and le&s;s con&s;iderate, and tends very much to di&s;|qualify from &s;ucce&s;sfully following him who is meek and low of heart.</P>
<P>As laying out bu&s;ine&s;s, more than is con|&s;i&s;tent with pure wi&s;dom, is an evil, &s;o this evil frequently leads into more. Too much bu&s;ine&s;s leads to hurry. In the hurry and toil too much &s;trong drink is often u&s;ed, and hereby many proceed to noi&s;e and wanton|ne&s;s, and &s;ome, tho' more con&s;iderate, do often &s;uffer lo&s;s, as to a true compo&s;edne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>I feel &s;incere de&s;ires in my heart that no rent, nor intere&s;t, might be laid &s;o high as to be a &s;nare to tenants. That no de&s;ires of gain may draw any too far in bu&s;ine&s;s. That no cares to &s;upport cu&s;toms, which have not their foundation in pure wi&s;dom, may have place in our minds, but that we may build on the &s;ure foundation, and feel our holy &s;hepherd to lead us, who alone is able to pre|&s;erve us, and bring forth from every thing which defiles.</P>

Having &s;everal times, in my travels, had opportunity to ob&s;erve the labour and man|ner of life of great numbers of &s;laves, it ap|pears to me that the true medium is lament|ably neglected by many, who a&s;&s;ign them their portion of labour.</P>
<P>Without &s;aying much at this time, con|cerning buying and &s;elling men for term of life, who have as ju&s;t a right to liberty as we have; nor about the great mi&s;eries, and ef|fu&s;ion of blood, con&s;equent to promoting the &s;lave-trade; and to &s;peak as favourably as may be, with regard to continuing tho&s;e in bondage who are among&s;t us, we cannot &s;ay there is no partiality in it: for whatever ten|derne&s;s may be manife&s;ted by individuals in their life time toward them, yet for people to be tran&s;mitted from a man to his po&s;terity, in the helple&s;s condition of &s;laves, appears incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the go&s;pel &s;pi|rit. From &s;uch proceedings it often follows, that per&s;ons in the decline of life, are de|prived of monies equitably due to them, and committed to the care, and &s;ubjected to the ab&s;olute power of young unexperienced men, who know but little about the weakne&s;s of old age, nor under&s;tand the language of de|clining life.</P>
<P>Where parents give their e&s;tates to their children, and then depend on them for a maintenance, they &s;ometimes meet with great inconveniences; but if the power of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, thus obtained, doth often rever&s;e the obligations of gratitude and filial duty, and

<P>For men to behold the fruits of their labour withheld from them, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by others, and in old age find them&s;elves de&s;titute of tho&s;e comfortable accommodations, and that tender regard which their time of life re|quires:</P>

<P>For men to be thus treated from one gene|ration to another, who, be&s;ides their own di&s;tre&s;&s;es, think on the &s;lavery entailed on their po&s;terity, and are grieved! what di&s;|agreeable thoughts mu&s;t they have of the profe&s;&s;ed followers of Je&s;us! and how mu&s;t their groans a&s;cend to that almighty being, who "will be a refuge for the oppre&s;&s;ed," P&s;alm ix. 9.</P>

<P>TO encourage children to do things with a view to get prai&s;e of men, to me ap|pears an ob&s;truction to their being inwardly acquainted with the &s;pirit of truth. For it is the work of the Holy Spirit to direct the mind to God, that in all our proceedings we may have a &s;ingle eye to him. To give alms in &s;ecret, to fa&s;t in &s;ecret, and labour to keep clear of that di&s;po&s;ition reproved by our Saviour, <Q>But all their works they do for to be &s;een of men.</Q> Matt. xxiii. 5.</P>
<P>That divine light which enlightens all men, I believe, does often &s;hine in the minds of children very early, and to humbly wait for wi&s;dom, that our conduct toward them may tend to forward their acquaintance with it, and &s;trengthen them in obedience thereto, appears to me to be a duty on all of us.</P>
<P>By cheri&s;hing the &s;pirit of pride, and the love of prai&s;e in them, I believe they may &s;ometimes improve fa&s;ter in learning, than otherwi&s;e they would, but to take mea&s;ures to forward children in learning, which na|turally tend to divert their minds from true humility, appears to me to favour of the wi&s;|dom of this world.</P>

If tutors are not acquainted with &s;anctifi|cation of &s;pirit, nor experienced in an hum|ble waiting for the leadings of truth, but follow the maxims of the wi&s;dom of this world, &s;uch children who are under their tu|ition, appear to me to be in danger of im|bibing thoughts, and apprehen&s;ions, rever&s;e to that meekne&s;s, and lowline&s;s of heart, which is nece&s;&s;ary for all the true followers of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Children at an age fit for &s;chools, are in a time of life which requires the patient atten|tion of pious people, and if we commit them to the tuition of &s;uch, who&s;e minds we be|lieve are not rightly prepared to <Q>train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</Q> we are in danger of not acting the part of faithful parents toward them; for our heavenly father doth not require us to do evil, that good may come of it; and it is needful that we deeply examine our&s;elves, le&s;t we get entangled in the wi&s;dom of this world, and, through wrong apprehen&s;ions, take &s;uch methods in education, as may prove a great injury to the minds of our children.</P>
<P>It is a lovely &s;ight to behold innocent chil|dren! and when they are &s;ent to &s;uch &s;chools where their tender minds are in imminent danger of being led a&s;tray by tutors, who do not live a &s;elf-denying life, or by the conver|&s;ation of &s;uch children who do not live in innocence, it is a ca&s;e much to be lamented.</P>

While a pious tutor hath the charge of no more children than he can take due care of, and keeps his authority in the truth, the good &s;pirit in which he leads and governs, works on the minds of &s;uch who are not hard|ened, and his labours not only tend to bring them forward in outward learning, but to open their under&s;tandings with re&s;pect to the true chri&s;tian life; but where a per&s;on hath charge of too many, and his thoughts and time are &s;o much employed in the out|ward affairs of his &s;chool, that he does not &s;o weightily attend to the &s;pirit and conduct of each individual, as to be enabled to admi|ni&s;ter rightly to all in due &s;ea&s;on; through &s;uch omi&s;&s;ion he not only &s;uffers, as to the &s;tate of his own mind, but the minds of the children are in danger of &s;uffering al&s;o.</P>
<P>To watch the &s;pirit of children, to nurture them in go&s;pel love, and labour to help them again&s;t that which would mar the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them; and a faithful performance of our duty, not only tends to their la&s;ting benefit, and our own peace, but al&s;o to render their company a|greeable to us.</P>
<P>In&s;truction, thus admini&s;tered, reaches the pure witne&s;s in the minds of &s;uch chil|dren who are not hardened, and begets love in them toward tho&s;e who thus lead them on; but where too great a number are committed to a tutor, and he, through much cumber, omits a careful attention to the minds of chil|dren,

there is danger of di&s;orders gradually increa&s;ing among&s;t them, till the effects there|of appear in their conduct, too &s;trong to be ea&s;ily remedied.</P>
<P>A care hath lived on my mind, that more time might be employed by parents at home, and by tutors at &s;chool, in weightily attend|ing to the &s;pirit and inclinations of children, and that we may &s;o lead, in&s;truct, and go|vern them, in this tender part of life, that nothing may be omitted in our power, to help them on their way to become the chil|dren of our father, who is in heaven.</P>
<P>Meditating on the &s;ituation of &s;chools in our provinces, my mind hath, at times, been affected with &s;orrow, and under the&s;e exer|ci&s;es it hath appeared to me, that if tho&s;e who have large e&s;tates, were faithful &s;tew|ads, and laid no rent, nor intere&s;t, nor other demand, higher than is con&s;i&s;tent with uni|ver&s;al love; and tho&s;e in lower circum&s;tan|ces would, under a moderate employ, &s;hun unnece&s;&s;ary expence, even to the &s;malle&s;t ar|ticle; and all unite in humbly &s;eeking to the Lord, he would graciou&s;ly in&s;truct us, and &s;trengthen us, to relieve the youth from various &s;nares, in which many of them are entangled.</P>

<HEAD>On the RIGHT USE of the LORD's OUTWARD GIFTS.</HEAD>
<P>AS our under&s;tandings are opened by the pure light, we experience that, through an inward approaching to God, the mind is &s;trengthened in obedience; and that by gra|tifying tho&s;e de&s;ires which are not of his be|getting, tho&s;e approaches to him are ob&s;truct|ed, and the deceivable &s;pirit gains &s;trength.</P>
<P>The&s;e truths, being as it were engraven upon our hearts, and our everla&s;ting intere&s;t in Chri&s;t evidently concerned herein, we be|come fervently engaged, that nothing may be nouri&s;hed which tends to feed pride or &s;elf-love in us. Thus in pure obedience, we are not only in&s;tructed in our duty to God, but al&s;o in the affairs which nece&s;&s;arily re|late to this life, and the &s;pirit of truth which guides into all truth, leavens the mind with a pious concern, that <Q>what&s;oever we do in word or deed, may be done in his name,</Q> Col. iii. 17.</P>
<P>Hence &s;uch buildings, furniture, food, and raiment, as be&s;t an&s;wer our nece&s;&s;ities, and are the lea&s;t likely to feed that &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit which is our enemy, are the mo&s;t acceptable to us.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate the mind is tender, and in|wardly watchful, that the love of gain draw us not into any bu&s;ine&s;s, which may weaken our love to our heavenly father, or bring un|nece&s;&s;ary trouble to any of his creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="013782_0358_0F91B417EF73A8C8">
Thus the way gradually opens to cea&s;e from that &s;pirit which craves riches and things fetched far, which &s;o mixeth with the cu&s;|toms of this world, and &s;o intrudes upon the true harmony of life, that the right me|dium of labour is very much departed from. And as the minds of people are &s;ettled in a &s;teady concern, not to hold nor po&s;&s;e&s;s any thing but what may be held con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom from above, they con&s;ider what they po&s;&s;e&s;s as the gift of God, and are in|wardly exerci&s;ed, that in all parts of their conduct they may act agreeable to the nature of the peaceable government of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>A little &s;upports &s;uch a life; and in a &s;tate truly re&s;igned to the Lord, the eye is &s;ingle, to &s;ee what outward employ he leads into, as a means of our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and a lively care is maintained to hold to that without launching further.</P>
<P>There is a harmony in the &s;everal parts of this divine work in the hearts of people; he who leads them to cea&s;e from tho&s;e gain|ful employments, carried on in that wi&s;dom which is from beneath, delivers al&s;o from the de&s;ire after worldly greatne&s;s, and reconciles the mind to a life &s;o plain, that a little doth &s;uffice.</P>
<P>Here the real comforts of life are not le&s;|&s;ened. Moderate exerci&s;e, in the way of true wi&s;dom, is plea&s;ant both to mind and body.</P>
<P>Food and raiment &s;ufficient, though in the greate&s;t &s;implicity, is accepted with content and gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="013782_0359_0F91B418AC3DA730">
The mutual love, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the faithful followers of Chri&s;t, is more pure than that friend&s;hip which is not &s;ea&s;oned with humility, how &s;pecious &s;oever the appear|ance.</P>
<P>Where people depart from pure wi&s;dom in one ca&s;e, it is often an introduction to depart from it in many more; and thus a &s;pirit which &s;eeks for outward greatne&s;s, and leads into worldly wi&s;dom to attain it, and &s;upport it, gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind.</P>
<P>In beholding the cu&s;tomary departure from the true medium of labour, and that unne|ce&s;&s;ary toil which many go through, in &s;up|porting outward greatne&s;s, and procuring delicacies:</P>
<P>In beholding how the true calmne&s;s of life is changed into hurry, and that many, by eagerly pur&s;uing outward trea&s;ure, are in great danger of withering as to the inward &s;tate of the mind:</P>
<P>In meditating on the works of this &s;pirit, and on the de&s;olations it makes among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, I may thankfully acknowledge, that I often feel pure love be|get longings in my heart, for the exaltation of the peaceable kingdom of Chri&s;t, and an engagement to labour according to the gift be&s;towed on me, for the promoting an hum|ble, plain, temperate way of living: a life where no unnece&s;&s;ary cares, nor expences, may encumber our minds, nor le&s;&s;en our a|bility to do good; where no de&s;ires after riches, or greatne&s;s, may lead into hard deal|ing;
<PB N="347" REF="013782_0360_0F91B4195CF1ED68">
where no connections with wordly minded men, may abate our love to God, nor weaken a true zeal for righteou&s;ne&s;s: a life, wherein we may diligently labour for re&s;ignedne&s;s to do, and &s;uffer, whatever our heavenly father may allot for us, in recon|ciling the world to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the prophet I&s;aiah had uttered his vi&s;ion, and declared that a time was coming wherein <Q>&s;words &s;hould be beat into plow|&s;hares, and &s;pears into pruning hooks, and that nation &s;hould not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, nor learn war any more;</Q> he im|mediately directs the minds of people to the divine teacher, in this remarkable language, <Q>O hou&s;e of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord,</Q> I&s;aiah ii. 5.</P>
<P>To wait for the direction of this light, in all temporal as well as &s;piritual concerns, ap|pears nece&s;&s;ary; for if in any ca&s;e we enter lightly into temporal affairs, without feeling this &s;pirit of truth to open our way therein, and through the love of this world proceed on, and &s;eek for gain by that bu&s;ine&s;s or traffic, which <Q>is not of the father, but of the world,</Q> 1 John ii. 16, we fail in our te&s;timony to the purity and peace of his go|vernment; and get into that which is for cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>This matter hath lain heavy on my mind, it being evident, that a life le&s;s humble, le&s;s &s;imple and plain, than that which Chri&s;t leads his &s;heep into, does nece&s;&s;arily require a &s;upport, which pure wi&s;dom does not pro|vide

<P>The&s;e things which he beholds nece&s;&s;ary for his people, he fails not to give them in his own way, and time; but as his ways are above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts, &s;o imaginary wants are different <Q>from the&s;e things which he knoweth that we have need of.</Q></P>
<P>As my meditations have been on the&s;e things, compa&s;&s;ion hath filled my heart to|ward my fellow creatures, involved in cu&s;|toms, grown up in <Q>the wi&s;dom of this world, which is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God,</Q> 1 Cor. iii. 19; and O that the youth may be &s;o thoroughly experienced in an humble walking before the Lord, that they may be his children, and know him to be their re|fuge, their &s;afe unfailing refuge! through the various dangers attending this uncertain &s;tate of being.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On &s;erving the Lord in our outward employ|ments.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER the humbling di&s;pen&s;ations of the Father of mercies, I have felt an inward labour for the good of my fellow creatures, and a concern that the holy &s;pirit, which alone can re&s;tore mankind to a &s;tate of true harmony, may with &s;inglene&s;s of heart be waited for and followed.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t there are many under that vi&s;itation, which, if faithfully attended to, will make them quick of under&s;tanding in the fear of the Lord, and qualify with firmne&s;s to be true patterns of the chri&s;tian life, who in living and walking may hold forth an invi|tation to others, to come out of the entangle|ments of the &s;pirit of this world.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="013782_0366_0F91B41E9BBC9600">
And that which I feel fir&s;t to expre&s;s is, a care for tho&s;e who are in circum&s;tances, which appear difficult, with re&s;pect to &s;up|porting their families in a way an&s;werable to pure wi&s;dom, that they may not be di&s;cou|raged, but remember that in humbly obey|ing the leading of Chri&s;t, he owneth us as his friends, <Q>Ye are my friends if ye do what&s;oever I command you;</Q> and to be a friend to Chri&s;t, is to be united to him, who hath all power in heaven and in earth; and tho' a woman may forget her &s;ucking child, yet will he not forget his faithful ones.</P>
<P>The condition of many who dwell in cities hath often affected me with a brotherly &s;ym|pathy, attended with a de&s;ire that re&s;ignati|on may be laboured for; and where the ho|ly leader directeth to a country life or &s;ome change of employ, he may be faithfully fol|lowed; for under the refining hand of the Lord I have &s;een, that the inhabitants of &s;ome cities are greatly increa&s;ed through &s;ome branches of bu&s;ine&s;s which his holy &s;pirit doth not lead into, and that being entangled in the&s;e things, tends to bring a cloud over the minds of people convinced of the lead|ings of this holy leader, and ob&s;tructs the coming of the kingdom of Chri&s;t on earth as it is in heaven.</P>
<P>Now if we indulge a de&s;ire to imitate our neighbours in tho&s;e things which harmoni&s;e not with the true chri&s;tian walking, the&s;e entanglements may hold fa&s;t to us, and &s;ome,

who in an awakening time, feel tender &s;cru|ples, with re&s;pect to their manner of life, may look on the example of others more no|ted in the church, who yet may not be re|fined from every degree of dro&s;s; and by looking on the&s;e examples, and de&s;iring to &s;upport their families in a way plea&s;ant to the natural mind, there may be danger of the worldly wi&s;dom gaining &s;trength in them, and of their departure from that pure feeling of truth, which if faithfully attended to, would teach contentment in the divine will, even in a very low e&s;tate.</P>
<P>One formerly &s;peaking on the profitable|ne&s;s of true humility, faith, "He that troubles not him&s;elf with anxious thoughts for more than is nece&s;&s;ary, lives little le&s;s than the life of angels, whil&s;t by a mind content with little, he imitates their want of nothing." Cave's primitive chri&s;tianity, page 31.</P>

For though in going forth we may meet with trials, which for a time may be painful, yet as we bow in true humility, and continue in it, an evidence is felt that God only is wi&s;e; and that in weaning us from all that is &s;elf|i&s;h, he prepares the way to a quiet habitation where all our de&s;ires are bounded by his wi&s;|dom. And an exerci&s;e of &s;pirit attends me, that we who are convinced of the pure lead|ings of truth, may bow in the deepe&s;t reve|rence, and &s;o watchfully regard this leader, that many who are grievou&s;ly entangled in a wilderne&s;s of vain cu&s;toms, may look upon us, and be in&s;tructed.

<P>Thus in a world greatly di&s;ordered, where men a&s;piring to outward greatne&s;s were wont to oppre&s;s others to &s;upport their de&s;igns, he who was of the highe&s;t de&s;cent, being the Son of God, and greater than any among&s;t the greate&s;t families of men, by his example and doctrines foreclo&s;ed his followers from claiming any &s;hew of outward greatne&s;s, from

<P>AS my mind hath been brought into a brotherly feeling with the poor, as to the things of this life, who are under trials in regard to getting a living in a way an|&s;werable to the purity of truth; a labour of
<PB N="362" REF="013782_0375_0F91B428648CDF60">
heart hath attended me, that their way may not be made difficult through the love of mo|ney in tho&s;e who are tried with plentiful e&s;tates, but that they with tenderne&s;s of heart may &s;ympathize with them.</P>
<P>It was the &s;aying of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, "Ye cannot &s;erve God and mammon." There is a deep feeling of the way of purity, a way in which the wi&s;dom of the world hath no part, but is opened by the &s;pirit of truth, and is "called the way of holine&s;s;" a way in which the traveller is employed in watch|ing unto prayer; and the outward gain we get in this journey is con&s;idered as a tru&s;t committed to us, by HIM who formed and &s;upports the world; and is the rightful di|rector of the u&s;e and application of the pro|duct of it.</P>
<P>Now except the mind be pre&s;erved cha&s;te, there is no &s;afety for us; but in an e&s;trange|ment from true re&s;ignation, the &s;pirit of the world ca&s;ts up a way, in which gain is many times principally attended to, and in which there is a &s;elfi&s;h application of outward trea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>How agreeable to the true harmony of &s;o|ciety, is that exhortation of the apo&s;tle? <Q>Look not every man on his own things, but every man al&s;o on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P>A per&s;on in outward pro&s;perity may have the power of obtaining riches, but the &s;ame mind being in him which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,
<PB N="363" REF="013782_0376_0F91B42921593B40">
he may feel a tenderne&s;s of heart towards tho&s;e of low degree; and in&s;tead of &s;etting him&s;elf above them, may look upon it as an unmerited favour, that his way through life is more ea&s;y than the way of many others; may improve every opportunity of leading forth out of tho&s;e cu&s;toms which have en|tangled the family; employ his time in look|ing into the wants of the poor members, and hold forth &s;uch a perfect example of humili|ation, that the pure witne&s;s may be reached in many minds; and the way opened for a harmonious walking together.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in promoting the happine&s;s of others, was not deficient in looking for the helple&s;s, who lay in ob&s;curity, nor did he &s;ave any thing to render him&s;elf honourable among&s;t men, which might have been of more u&s;e to the weak members in his Father's family; of who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion towards us I may now &s;peak a little. He who was per|fectly happy in him&s;elf, moved with infinite love, <Q>took not upon him the nature of an|gels,</Q> but our imperfect natures, and therein wre&s;tled with the temptations which attend us in this life; and being the Son of HIM who is greater than earthly princes, yet became a companion to poor, &s;incere heart|ed men; and though he gave the cleare&s;t evidence that divine power attended him, yet the mo&s;t unfavourable con&s;tructions were framed by a &s;elf righteous people; tho&s;e miracles repre&s;ented as the effect of a diabo|lical power, and endeavours u&s;ed to render

him hateful, as having his mi&s;&s;ion from the prince of darkne&s;s; nor did their envy cea&s;e till they took him like a criminal and brought him to trial. Though &s;ome may affect to carry the appearance of being unmoved at the apprehen&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s, our dear Re|deemer, who was perfectly &s;incere, having the &s;ame human nature which we have, and feeling, a little before he was apprehended, the weight of that work upon him, for which he came into the world, was <Q>&s;orrowful even unto death;</Q> here the human nature &s;truggled to be excu&s;ed from a cup &s;o bitter; but his prayers centered in re&s;ignation, <Q>Not my will but thine be done.</Q> In this con|flict, &s;o great was his agony that <Q>&s;weat like drops of blood fell from him to the ground.</Q></P>
<P>Behold now as foretold by the prophet, he is in a judicial manner <Q>numbered with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</Q> Behold him as &s;ome poor man of no reputation, &s;tanding before the high prie&s;t and elders, and before Herod and Pilate, where witne&s;&s;es appear again&s;t him, and he mindful of the mo&s;t gracious de&s;ign of his coming, declineth to plead in his own defence, <Q>but as a &s;heep that is dumb be|fore his &s;hearer,</Q> &s;o under many accu&s;ati|ons, revilings, and buffetings, remained &s;i|lent. And tho' he &s;ignified to Peter that he had acce&s;s to power &s;ufficient to overthrow all their outward forces; yet retaining a re&s;ig|nation to &s;uffer for the &s;ins of mankind, he exerted not that power, but permitted them
<PB N="365" REF="013782_0378_0F91B42A9EC47318">
to go on in their malicious de&s;igns, and pro|nounce him to be worthy of death, even him who was perfect in goodne&s;s; thus <Q>in his humiliation his judgment was taken a|way, and he, like &s;ome vile criminal, led as a lamb to the &s;laughter.</Q> Under the&s;e heavy trials (though poor un&s;table Pilate was convinced of his innocence, yet) the peo|ple generally looked upon him as a deceiver, a bla&s;phemer, and the approaching puni&s;h|ment as a ju&s;t judgment upon him, <Q>They e&s;teemed him &s;mitten of God and afflict|ed.</Q> So great had been the &s;urprize of his di&s;ciples, at his being taken by armed men, that they "for&s;ook him and fled;" thus they hid their faces from him, he was de&s;pi&s;ed, and by their conduct it appeared as though "they e&s;teemed him not."</P>
<P>But contrary to that opinion, of his being &s;mitten of God and afflicted, it was for our &s;akes that <Q>he was put to grief; he was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; he was brui&s;ed for our iniquities;</Q> and under the weight of them manife&s;ting the deepe&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ion for the in&s;truments of his mi&s;ery, laboured as their advocate, and in the deeps of affliction, with an unconquerable pati|ence, cried out, <Q>Father forgive them, they know not what they do</Q>!</P>
<P>Now this mind being in us, which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, it removes from our hearts the de&s;ire of &s;uperiority, worldly honour or greatne&s;s; a deep attention is felt to the di|vine coun&s;ellor, and an ardent engagement

Now in all our concerns it is nece&s;&s;ary that the leading of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t be humbly waited for and faithfully followed, as the on|ly means of being pre&s;erved cha&s;te as an holy people, who "in all things are circum&s;pect." Exod. xxiii. 13, that nothing we do may carry the appearance of approbation of the works of wickedne&s;s, make the unrighteous more at ea&s;e in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, or occa&s;ion the injuries committed again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ed to be more lightly looked over.</P>
<P>Where morality is kept to, and &s;upported by the inhabitants of a country, there is a certain reproach attends tho&s;e individuals a|mong&s;t them, who manife&s;tly deviate there|from. Thus, if a per&s;on of good report, is charged with &s;tealing goods out of an open &s;hop in the day time, and on a public trial found guilty, and the law in that ca&s;e put in execution, he therein &s;u&s;tains a lo&s;s of repu|tation; but if he be convicted a &s;econd and third time of the like offence, his good name would cea&s;e among&s;t &s;uch who knew the&s;e things. If his neighbour, reputed an hone&s;t man, being charged with buying goods of this thief, at a time when the purcha&s;er knew they were &s;tolen, and on a public trial is found guilty, this purcha&s;er would meet with di&s;e&s;teem, but if he per&s;i&s;ted in buying &s;tolen
<PB N="369" REF="013782_0382_0F91B43172DAC898">
goods, knowing them to be &s;uch, and was publicly convicted thereof a &s;econd and third time, he would no longer be con&s;idered as an hone&s;t man by them who knew the&s;e things; nor would it appear of good report to be found in his company, buying his traffick, till &s;ome evident tokens of &s;incere repentance appeared in him. But where iniquity is committed openly, and the authors of it are not brought to ju&s;tice, nor put to &s;hame, their hands grow &s;trong. Thus the general corruption of the Jews &s;hortly before their &s;tate was broke up by the Chaldeans, is de|&s;cribed by their boldne&s;s in impiety; for as their leaders were connected together in wick|edne&s;s, they &s;trengthened one another, and grew confident, <Q>Were they a&s;hamed when they had committed abominations? nay, they were not at all a&s;hamed, neither could they blu&s;h.</Q> Jer. vi. 15, on which account the Lord thus expo&s;tulates with them, <Q>What hath my beloved to do in my hou&s;e, &s;eeing &s;he hath wrought lewdne&s;s with many? and the holy fle&s;h is pa&s;&s;ed from thee; when thou doe&s;t evil, then thou rejoice&s;t.</Q> Jer. xi. 15.</P>

Where righteous men join in bu&s;ine&s;s their company gives en|couragement to others; and as one grain of incen&s;e deliberately offered to the prince of this world, renders an offering to God in that &s;tate unacceptable; and from tho&s;e e&s;teemed leaders of the people may be injurious to the weak; it requires deep humility of heart, to follow him faithfully, who alone gives &s;ound wi&s;dom and the &s;pirit of true di&s;cerning; and O how nece&s;&s;ary it is, to con&s;ider the weight of a holy profe&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>The conduct of &s;ome formerly, gave occa|&s;ion of complaint again&s;t them, <Q>Thou ha&s;t defiled thy &s;anctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick.</Q> Ezek. xxviii. 18, and in &s;everal places it is charged again&s;t I&s;rael that they had polluted the holy name.</P>

The prophet I&s;aiah repre&s;ents inward &s;anc|tification in the &s;imilitude of being purged from that which is fuel for fire; and particu|larly de&s;cribes the outward fruits, brought forth by tho&s;e who dwell in this inward ho|line&s;s, <Q>they walk righteou&s;ly, and &s;peak uprightly.</Q> By walking he repre&s;ents the journey through life, as a righteous journey; and "by &s;peaking uprightly," &s;eems to point at that which Mo&s;es appears to have had in view, when he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, <Q>Thou &s;halt not follow a multitude to do evil, nor &s;peak in a ca&s;e to decline after many to wre&s;t judgment.</Q> Exod. xxiii. 2.</P>

The prophet in a &s;ight of divine work a|mong&s;t many people, declared in the name of the Lord, <Q>I will gather all nations and tongues, and they &s;hall come and &s;ee my glory.

<P>Behold here how the prophets had an in|ward &s;en&s;e of the &s;preading of the kingdom of Chri&s;t; and how he was &s;poken of as one who &s;hould <Q>take the heathen for his inhe|ritance, and the utmo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>It is worthy of remembrance, that people in different ages, deeply bapti&s;ed into the na|ture of that work for which Chri&s;t &s;uffered, have joyfully offered up their liberty and lives for the promoting of it in the earth.</P>
<P>Policarp, who was reputed a di&s;ciple of St. John, having attained to great age, was at length &s;entenced to die for his religion, and being brought to the fire, prayed nearly as follows, "Thou God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom I have received the knowledge of thee!

<P>I mention the&s;e, as a few examples, out of many, of the powerful operation of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, where people are fully devoted to it, and of the ardent longings in their minds for the &s;preading of his kingdom among&s;t mankind.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On loving our Neighbours as our&s;elves.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we love the Lord with all our hearts, and his creatures in his love, we are then pre&s;erved in ten|derne&s;s both toward mankind and the animal creation; but if another &s;pirit gets room in our minds, and we follow it in our proceed|ings, we are then in the way of di&s;ordering the affairs of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>If a man &s;ucce&s;sful in bu&s;ine&s;s expends part of his income in things of no real u&s;e, while the poor employed by him pa&s;s through great difficulties in getting the nece&s;&s;aries of life, this requires his &s;erious attention.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="013782_0396_0F91B43E1BE718D0">
If &s;everal principal men in bu&s;ine&s;s unite in &s;etting the wages of tho&s;e who work for hire, and therein have regard to a profit to them&s;elves an&s;werable to unnece&s;&s;ary expence in their families, while the wages of the others on a moderate indu&s;try will not afford a com|fortable living for their families, and a pro|per education for their children; this is like laying a temptation in the way of &s;ome to &s;trive for a place higher than they are in, when they have not &s;tock &s;ufficient for it.</P>
<P>Now I feel a concern in the &s;pring of pure love, that all who have plenty of outward &s;ub&s;tance, may example others in the right u&s;e of things; may carefully look into the condition of poor people, and beware of ex|acting on them with regard to their wages.</P>
<P>While hired labourers, by moderate in|du&s;try, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, may live comfortably, rai&s;e up families, and give them &s;uitable education, it appears rea&s;onable for them to be content with their wages.</P>
<P>If they who have plenty, love their fellow creatures in that love which is divine, and in all their proceedings have an equal regard to the good of mankind univer&s;ally, their place in &s;ociety is a place of care, an office requir|ing attention, and the more we po&s;&s;e&s;s, the greater is our tru&s;t, and with an increa&s;e of trea&s;ure, an increa&s;e of care becomes nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>When our will is &s;ubject to the will of God, and in relation to the things of this world, we have nothing in view, but a comfortable
<PB N="384" REF="013782_0397_0F91B2ED64B14B98">
living equally with the re&s;t of our fellow creatures, then outward trea&s;ures are no far|ther de&s;irable than as we feel a gift in our minds equal to the tru&s;t, and &s;trength to act as dutiful children in his &s;ervice, who hath formed all mankind, and appointed a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for us in this world.</P>
<P>A de&s;ire for trea&s;ures on any other motive, appears to be again&s;t that command of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <Q>Lay not up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures on earth, Mat. vi. 19.</Q></P>
<P>He forbids not laying up in the &s;ummer again&s;t the wants of winter; nor doth he teach us to be &s;lothful in that which properly relates to our being in this world; but in this prohibition he puts in <HI>your&s;elves</HI> <Q>Lay not up for <HI>your&s;elves</HI> trea&s;ures here on earth.</Q></P>
<P>Now in the pure light, this language is under&s;tood, for in the love of Chri&s;t there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons; and while we abide in his love, we live not to our&s;elves, but to him who died for us. And as we are thus united in &s;pirit to Chri&s;t, we are engaged to labour in promoting that work in the earth for which he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of mind our de&s;ires are, that every hone&s;t member in &s;ociety may have a portion of trea&s;ure, and &s;hare of tru&s;t, an|&s;werable to that gift, with which our hea|venly Father hath gifted us.</P>
<LG>
<L>In great trea&s;ure, there is a great tru&s;t.</L>
<L>A great tru&s;t requireth great care.</L>
<L>But the laborious mind wants re&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="385" REF="013782_0398_0F91B2EE38DA88F0">
A pious man is content to do a &s;hare of bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;ociety, an&s;werable to the gif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s with which he is endowed, while the chan|nels of bu&s;ine&s;s are free from unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, but is careful le&s;t at any time his heart be overcharged.</P>
<P>In the harmonious &s;pirit of &s;ociety <Q>Chri&s;t is all in all,</Q> Col. iii. 11.</P>
<P>Here it is that <Q>old things are pa&s;t away, all things are new, all things are of God,</Q> 2 Cor. v. 17, 18. and the de&s;ire for outward riches is at an end.</P>
<P>They of low degree who have &s;mall gifts, enjoy their help who have large gifts; tho&s;e with their &s;mall gifts, have a &s;mall degree of care, while the&s;e with their large gifts, have a large degree of care: and thus to abide in the love of Chri&s;t, and enjoy a comfortable living in this world is all that is aimed at by tho&s;e members in &s;ociety, to whom Chri&s;t is made wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But when they who have much trea&s;ure, are not faithful &s;tewards of the gifts of God, great difficulties attend it.</P>
<P>Now this matter hath deeply affected my mind. The Lord, through merciful cha&s;ti&s;e|ments, hath given me a feeling of that love, in which the harmony of &s;ociety &s;tandeth, and a &s;ight of the growth of that &s;eed which bringeth forth wars and great calamities in the world, and a labour attends me to open it to others.</P>
<P>Now to act with integrity, according to that &s;trength of mind and body with which

<P>If we, being poor, are hardly dealt with by tho&s;e who are rich, and under this diffi|culty are frugal and indu&s;trious, and in true humility open our ca&s;e to them who oppre&s;s us, this may reach the pure witne&s;s in their minds; and though we &s;hould remain under difficulties as to the outward, yet if we abide in the love of Chri&s;t, all will work for our good.</P>
<P>When we feel what it is to &s;uffer in the true &s;uffering &s;tate, then we experience the truth of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, that, <Q>as the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t abound in us, &s;o our con&s;olation aboundeth by Chri&s;t,</Q> 2 Cor. i. 5.</P>
<P>But if poor people who are hardly dealt with, do not attain to the true &s;uffering &s;tate, do not labour in true love with tho&s;e who deal hardly with them, but envy their out|ward greatne&s;s, murmur in their hearts be|cau&s;e of their own poverty, and &s;trive in the wi&s;dom of this world to get riches for them|&s;elves and their children; this is like wan|dering in the dark.</P>
<P>If we who are of a middle &s;tation between riches and poverty, are affected at times with the oppre&s;&s;ions of the poor, and feel a tender regard for our po&s;terity after us; O how ne|ce&s;&s;ary

<P>I have felt great di&s;tre&s;s of mind &s;ince I came on this i&s;land, on account of the mem|bers of our &s;ociety being mixed with the world in various &s;orts of bu&s;ine&s;s and traffic, carried on in impure channels. Great is the trade to Africa for &s;laves; and in loading the&s;e &s;hips abundance of people are employed in the manufactories.</P>
<P>Friends in early time refu&s;ed, on a religi|ous principle, to make or trade in &s;uperflui|ties, of which we have many large te&s;timo|nies on record, but for want of faithfulne&s;s &s;ome gave way, even &s;ome who&s;e examples
<PB N="404" REF="013782_0417_0F91B301AE9D1B00">
were of note in &s;ociety, and from thence o|thers took more liberty: members of our &s;o|ciety worked in &s;uperfluities, and bought and &s;old them, and thus dimne&s;s of &s;ight came over many. At length, friends got into the u&s;e of &s;ome &s;uperfluities in dre&s;s, and in the furniture of their hou&s;es, and this hath &s;pread from le&s;s to more, till &s;uperfluity of &s;ome kinds is common among&s;t us.</P>
<P>In this declining &s;tate many look at the example one of another, and too much ne|glect the pure feeling of truth.

<P>And I have felt in that which doth not de|ceive, that if friends who have known the truth, keep in that tenderne&s;s of heart, where all views of outward gain are given up, and their tru&s;t is only on the Lord, he will gra|ciou&s;ly lead &s;ome to be patterns of deep &s;elf-denial, in things relating to trade, and han|dicraft labour; and that &s;ome who have plenty of the trea&s;ures of this world, will ex|ample in a plain frugal life, and pay wages to &s;uch whom they may hire, more liberally than is now cu&s;tomary in &s;ome places.</P>

John Gratton, in his journal, p. 45, &s;aid, "The Lord is my portion, I &s;hall not want. He hath wrought all my works in me. I am nothing but what I am in him."</P>
<P>Gilbert Latey, through the powerful ope|rations of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t in his &s;oul, was brought to that depth of &s;elf-denial, that he could not join with that proud &s;pirit in other people, which inclined them to want vanities and &s;uperfluities. This friend was often a|mong&s;t the chief rulers of the nation in times of per&s;ecution, and it appears by the te&s;ti|mony of friends, that his dwelling was &s;o e|vidently in the pure life of truth, that in his vi&s;its to tho&s;e great men, he found a place in their minds; and that king James the &s;econd, in the times of his troubles, made particular mention in a very re&s;pectful manner of what Gilbert once &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Gilbert found a concern to write an epi&s;tle, in which are the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions; "Fear the Lord, ye men of all &s;orts, trades, and callings, and leave off all the evil that is in them, for the Lord is grieved with all the evils u&s;ed in your employments which you are exerci&s;ed in."</P>
<P>"It is even a grief to &s;ee how you are &s;er|vants to &s;in, and in&s;truments of Satan." See his works, p. 42, &amp;c.</P>
<P>George Fox, in an epi&s;tle, writes thus: "Friends, &s;tand in the eternal power of God, witne&s;&s;es again&s;t the pomps and vani|ties of this world."</P>

"Such trade&s;men who &s;tand as witne&s;&s;es in the power of God, cannot fulfil the peo|ple's minds in the&s;e vanities, and therefore they are offended at them."</P>
<P>"Let all tru&s;t in the Lord, and wait pa|tiently on him; for when truth fir&s;t broke forth in London, many trade&s;men could not take &s;o much money in their &s;hops for &s;ome time, as would buy them bread and water, becau&s;e they with&s;tood the world's ways, fa&s;hions, and cu&s;toms; yet by their patient waiting on the Lord in their good life and conver&s;ation, they an&s;wered the truth in peo|ple's hearts, and thus their bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;|ed."

<P>Now Chri&s;t our holy leader graciou&s;ly con|tinueth to open the under&s;tandings of his people, and as circum&s;tances alter from age to age, &s;ome who are deeply baptized into a feeling of the &s;tate of things, are led by his holy &s;pirit into exerci&s;es in &s;ome re&s;pect dif|ferent from tho&s;e which attended the faithful in foregoing ages, and through the con&s;train|ings of pure love, are engaged to open the feelings they have to others.</P>
<P>In faithfully following Chri&s;t, the heart is weaned from the de&s;ire of riches, and we are led into a life &s;o plain and &s;imple, that a little doth &s;uffice, and thus the way openeth to deny our&s;elves, under all the tempting al|lurements of that gain, which we know is the gain of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<P>Where people through the power of Chri&s;t are thoroughly &s;ettled in a right u&s;e of things, freed from all unnece&s;&s;ary care and expence, the mind in this true re&s;ignation is at liberty from the bands of a narrow &s;elf-intere&s;t, to attend from time to time on the movings of his &s;pirit upon us, though he leads into that, through which our faith is clo&s;ely tried.</P>
<P>The language of Chri&s;t is pure, and to the pure in heart, this pure language is intelligi|ble; but in the love of money, the mind be|ing intent on gain, is too full of human con|trivance to attend to it.</P>

<P>IN the trade to Africa for &s;laves, and in the management of &s;hips going on the&s;e voy|ages, many of our lads and young men have a con&s;iderable part of their education.</P>
<P>Now what pious father beholding his &s;on placed in one of the&s;e &s;hips, to learn the prac|tice of a mariner, could forbear mourning over him?</P>
<P>Where youth are exampled in means of getting money, &s;o full of violence, and u&s;ed to exerci&s;e &s;uch cruelties on their fellow-crea|tures, the di&s;advantage to them in their edu|cation is very great.</P>
<P>But I feel it in my mind to write concern|ing the &s;eafaring life in general.</P>
<P>In the trade carried on from the We&s;t-In|dies, and from &s;ome parts of the continent,
<PB N="409" REF="013782_0422_0F91B306210BEA48">
the produce of the labour of &s;laves is a con|&s;iderable part.</P>
<P>And &s;ailors who are frequently at ports where &s;laves abound, and conver&s;e often with people who oppre&s;s them without the appear|ance of remor&s;e, and often with &s;ailors employ|ed in the &s;lave trade, how powerfully do the&s;e evil examples &s;pread among&s;t the &s;eafaring youth!</P>
<P>I have had many opportunities to feel and under&s;tand the general &s;tate of the &s;eafaring life among&s;t us, and my mind hath often been &s;ad on account of &s;o many lads and young men being trained up amid&s;t &s;o great corruption.</P>
<P>Under the humbling power of Chri&s;t I have &s;een, that if the leadings of his holy &s;pirit were faithfully attended to by his pro|fe&s;&s;ed followers in general, the heathen nati|ons would be exampled in righteou&s;ne&s;s. A le&s;s number of people would be employed on the &s;eas. The channels of trade would be more free from defilement. Fewer people would be employed in vanities and &s;uperflu|ities.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of cities would be le&s;s in number.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have much lands would become fathers to the poor.</P>
<P>More people would be employed in the &s;weet employment of hu&s;bandry, and in the path of pure wi&s;dom, labour would be an a|greeable, healthful employment.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="013782_0423_0F91B3076EE33450">
In the opening of the&s;e things in my mind, I feel a living concern that we who have felt divine love in our hearts may faithfully abide in it, and like good &s;oldiers endure hardne&s;s for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>
<P>He, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, exhorting his fol|lowers to love one another, adds, <Q>As I have loved you.</Q> John xiii. 34.</P>
<P>He loved Lazarus, yet in his &s;ickne&s;s did not heal him, but left him to endure the pains of death, that in re&s;toring him to life, the people might be confirmed in the true faith.</P>
<P>He loved his di&s;ciples, but &s;ent them forth on a me&s;&s;age attended with great difficulty, among&s;t hard-hearted people, &s;ome of whom would think that in killing them they did God &s;ervice.</P>
<P>So deep is divine love, that in &s;tedfa&s;tly abiding in it, we are prepared to deny our|&s;elves of all that gain which is contrary to pure wi&s;dom, and to follow Chri&s;t, even un|der contempt, and through &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>While friends were kept truly humble, and walked according to the purity of our prin|ciples, the divine witne&s;s in many hearts was reached; but when a worldly &s;pirit got en|trance, therewith came in luxuries and &s;u|perfluities, and &s;pread by little and little, even among&s;t the foremo&s;t rank in &s;ociety, and from thence others took liberty in that way more abundantly.</P>
<P>In the continuation of the&s;e things from parents to children, there were many wants
<PB N="411" REF="013782_0424_0F91B307DD180B38">
to &s;upply, even wants unknown to friends while they faithfully followed Chri&s;t. And in &s;triving to &s;upply the&s;e wants many have exacted on the poor, many have entered on employments, in which they often labour in upholding pride and vanity. Many have looked on one another, been &s;trengthened in the&s;e things, one by the example of another, and as to the pure divine &s;eeing, dimne&s;s hath come over many, and the channels of true brotherly love been ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>People may have no intention to oppre&s;s, yet by entering on expen&s;ive ways of life, their minds may be &s;o entangled therein, and &s;o engaged to &s;upport expen&s;ive cu&s;toms, as to be e&s;tranged from the pure &s;ympathizing &s;pirit.</P>
<P>As I have travelled in England, I have had a tender feeling of the condition of poor peo|ple, &s;ome of whom though hone&s;t and indu|&s;trious, have nothing to &s;pare toward paying for the &s;chooling of their children.</P>
<P>There is a proportion between labour and the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and in true brotherly love the mind is open to feel after the nece&s;|&s;ities of the poor.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the poor there are &s;ome that are weak through age, and others of a weakly nature, who pa&s;s through &s;traits in very pri|vate life, without a&s;king relief from the publick.</P>
<P>Such who are &s;trong and healthy may do that bu&s;ine&s;s, which to the weakly may be oppre&s;&s;ive; and in performing that in a day
<PB N="412" REF="013782_0425_0F91B309D9CB68A8">
which is e&s;teemed a day's labour, by weakly per&s;ons in the field and in the &s;hops, and by weakly women who &s;pin and knit in the manufactories, they often pa&s;s through wea|rine&s;s; and many &s;ighs I believe are uttered in &s;ecret, unheard by &s;ome who might ea&s;e their burdens.</P>
<P>Labour in the right medium is healthy, but in too much of it there is a painful wea|rine&s;s; and the hard&s;hips of the poor are &s;ometimes increa&s;ed through want of more agreeable nouri&s;hment, more plentiful fewel for the fire, and warmer cloathing in the winter than their wages will an&s;wer.</P>
<P>When I have beheld plenty in &s;ome hou&s;es to a degree of luxury, the condition of poor children brought up without learning, and the condition of the weakly and aged, who &s;trive to live by their labour, have often re|vived in my mind, as ca&s;es of which &s;ome who live in fulne&s;s need to be put in remem|brance.</P>
<P>There are few, if any, could behold their fellow-creatures lie long in di&s;tre&s;s and for|bear to help them, when they could do it without any inconvenience; but cu&s;toms re|quiring much labour to &s;upport them, do often lie heavy on the poor, while they who live in the&s;e cu&s;toms are &s;o entangled in a multitude of unnece&s;&s;ary concerns, that they think but little of the hard&s;hips which the poor people go through.</P>

<P>WORSHIP in &s;ilence hath often been refre&s;hing to my mind, and a care attends me that a young generation may feel the nature of this wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Great expence ari&s;eth in relation to that which is called divine wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable part of this expence is ap|plied toward outward greatne&s;s, and many poor people in rai&s;ing of tithe, labour in &s;up|porting cu&s;toms contrary to the &s;implicity that there is in Chri&s;t, toward whom my mind hath often been moved with pity.</P>
<P>In pure &s;ilent wor&s;hip, we dwell under the holy anointing, and feel Chri&s;t to be our &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>Here the be&s;t of teachers mini&s;ters to the &s;everal conditions of his flock, and the &s;oul receives immediately from the divine fountain, that with which it is nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>As I have travelled at times where tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties have attended our meetings, and have perceived how little &s;ome of them knew of the nature of &s;ilent wor&s;hip; I have felt tender de&s;ires in my heart that we who often &s;it &s;ilent in our meetings, may live an|&s;werable to the nature of an inward fellow|&s;hip with God, that no &s;tumbling block through us, may be laid in their way.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="013782_0427_0F91B30AB8410BF8">
Such is the load of unnece&s;&s;ary expence which lieth on that which is called divine &s;ervice in many places, and &s;o much are the minds of many people employed in outward forms and ceremonies, that the opening of an inward &s;ilent wor&s;hip in this nation to me hath appeared to be a precious opening.</P>
<P>Within the la&s;t four hundred years, many pious people have been deeply exerci&s;ed in &s;oul on account of the &s;uper&s;tition which prevailed among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ed followers of Chri&s;t, and in &s;upport of their te&s;timony a|gain&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive idolatry, &s;ome in &s;everal ages have fini&s;hed their cour&s;e in the flames.</P>
<P>It appears by the hi&s;tory of the reformati|on, that through the faithfulne&s;s of the mar|tyrs, the under&s;tandings of many have been opened, and the minds of people, from age to age, been more and more prepared for a real &s;piritual wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>My mind is often affected with a &s;en&s;e of the condition of tho&s;e people, who in different ages have been meek and patient, following Chri&s;t through great afflictions: And while I behold the &s;everal &s;teps of reformation, and that clearne&s;s, to which through divine good|ne&s;s, it hath been brought by our ance&s;tors; I feel tender de&s;ires that we who &s;ometimes meet in &s;ilence, may never by our conduct lay &s;tumbling-blocks in the way of others, and hinder the progre&s;s of the reformation in the world.</P>
<P>It was a complaint again&s;t &s;ome who were called the Lord's people, that they brought
<PB N="415" REF="013782_0428_0F91B30BEE0A0E78">
polluted bread to his altar, and &s;aid the table of the Lord was contemptible.</P>
<P>In real &s;ilent wor&s;hip the &s;oul feeds on that which is divine; but we cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and that table which is prepared by the God of this world.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t is our &s;hepherd, and feedeth us, and we are faithful in following him, our lives will have an inviting language, and the table of the lord will not be polluted.</P>

<P>FEELING at this time a renewed con|cern that the pure principle of light and life, and the righteous fruits thereof may &s;pread and prevail among&s;t mankind, there is an engagement on my heart to labour with my brethren in religious profe&s;&s;ion, that none of us may be a &s;tumbling block in the way of others; but may &s;o walk that our conduct may reach the pure witne&s;s in the hearts of &s;uch who are not in profe&s;&s;ion with us.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, while we publicly own that the holy Spirit is our leader, the profe&s;|&s;ion is in it&s;elf weighty, and the weightine&s;s thereof increa&s;eth, in proportion as we are noted among the profe&s;&s;ors of truth, and

<P>Many under our profe&s;&s;ion for want of due attention, and a perfect re&s;ignation to this Divine Teacher, have in &s;ome things mani|fe&s;ted a deviation from the purity of our re|ligious principles, and the&s;e deviations hav|ing crept in among&s;t us by little and little, and increa&s;ing from le&s;s to greater, have been &s;o far unnoticed, that &s;ome living in them, have been active in putting di&s;cipline in prac|tice, with relation to others, who&s;e conduct hath appeared more di&s;honourable in the world.</P>
<P>Now as my mind hath been exerci&s;ed be|fore the Lord, I have &s;een, that the di&s;ci|pline of the church of Chri&s;t &s;tandeth in that which is pure; that it is the wi&s;dom from above which gives authority to di&s;cipline; and that the weightine&s;s thereof &s;tandeth not in any outward circum&s;tances, but in the authority of Chri&s;t who is the author of it; and where any walk after the fle&s;h, and not according to the purity of truth, and at the &s;ame time are active in putting di&s;cipline in practice, a veil is gradually drawn over the purity of di&s;cipline, and over that holine&s;s of life, which Chri&s;t leads tho&s;e into, <Q>in whom the love of God is verily perfected,</Q> 1 John ii. 5.</P>

How weighty are tho&s;e in&s;tructions of our Redeemer concerning religious duties, when he points out, that they who pray, &s;hould be &s;o obedient to the teachings of the Holy Spi|rit, that humbly confiding in his help, they may &s;ay, <Q>Thy name O Father be hallowed!

<P>Chri&s;t is called the head of the church, Eph. i. 22.</P>

<P>Thus the church hath a name that is &s;a|cred, and the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping this name holy, appears evident; for where a number of people unite in a profe&s;&s;ion of being led by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, and publi&s;h their prin|ciples to the world, the acts and proceedings of that people may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be con|&s;idered as &s;uch which Chri&s;t is the author of.</P>

<P>There have been in time pa&s;t &s;evere per&s;e|cutions under the Engli&s;h government, and many &s;incere-hearted people have &s;uffered death for the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, who&s;e faithfulne&s;s in their day hath mini&s;tred encouragement to others, and been a ble&s;&s;ing to many who have &s;ucceeded them; thus from age to age, the darkne&s;s being more and more removed, a channel at length, through the tender mercies of God, hath been opened for the exerci&s;e of the pure gift of the go&s;pel mi|ni&s;try, without interruption from outward power, a work, the like of which is rare, and unknown in many parts of the world.</P>
<P>As the&s;e things are often fre&s;h in my mind, and this great work of God going on in the earth has been open before me, that liberty of con&s;cience with which we are favoured, hath appeared not as a light matter.</P>

As my mind hath been thus exerci&s;ed, I have &s;een that to be active, and bu&s;y in the vi&s;ible gathered church, without the leadings of the Holy Spirit is not only unprofitable, but tends to increa&s;e dimne&s;s, and where way is not opened to proceed in the light of truth, a &s;top is felt by tho&s;e who humbly at|tend to the Divine Leader, a &s;top which in relation to good order in the vi&s;ible gathered church, is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to be ob&s;erved; thus Robert Barclay in his treati&s;e on di&s;cipline holds forth, page 65. 68. 84.

<P>Now in this &s;top I have learned the nece&s;|&s;ity of waiting on the Lord in humility, that the works of all may be brought to light, and tho&s;e to judgment which are wrought in the wi&s;dom of this world, and have al&s;o &s;een, that in a mind thoroughly &s;ubjected to the power of the cro&s;s, there is a favour of life to be felt, which evidently tends to ga|ther &s;ouls to God, while the greate&s;t works in the vi&s;ible gathered church brought forth in man's wi&s;dom, remain to be unprofitable.</P>

<P>Have none of my fellow-creatures an equi|table right to any part which is called mine?</P>
<P>Have the gifts, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions received by me from others been conveyed in a way free from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s &s;o far as I have &s;een?</P>
<P>The principle of peace in which our tru&s;t is only on the Lord, and our minds weaned from a dependance on the &s;trength of armies, hath appeared to me very precious, and I often feel &s;trong de&s;ires, that we who pro|fe&s;s this principle, may &s;o walk, as to give ju&s;t cau&s;e for none of our fellow-creatures to be offended at us; that our lives may evi|dently manife&s;t, that we are redeemed from that &s;pirit in which wars are: our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in pointing out the danger of &s;o

leaning on man, as to neglect the leadings of his Holy Spirit, &s;aid, <Q>Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your fa|ther which is in heaven,</Q> Mat. xxiii. 9. where the wi&s;dom from above is faithfully followed, and therein we are entru&s;ted with &s;ub&s;tance, it is a trea&s;ure committed to our care in the nature of an inheritance, as an inheritance from him, who formed, and &s;up|ports the world. Now in this condition the true enjoyment of the good things of this life is under&s;tood, and that ble&s;&s;ing felt, in which is real &s;afety; this is what I apprehend our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had in view, when he pronounc|ed, <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the meek, for they &s;hall in|herit the earth.</Q></P>
<P>Selfi&s;h worldly minded men may hold lands in the &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, and depending on the &s;trength of the outward power, be perplexed with &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s, le&s;t the injured &s;hould &s;ometime overpower them, and that mea&s;ure meted to them, which they mea&s;ure to others.&mdash;Thus &s;elfi&s;h men may po&s;&s;e&s;s the earth; but it is the meek who inherit it, and enjoy it as an inheritance from the heavenly Fa|ther, free from all the defilements and per|plexities of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Where proceedings have been in that wi&s;|dom which is from beneath, and inequitable gain gathered by a man, and left as a gift to his children, who being entangled by the &s;ame worldly &s;pirit, have not attained to that clearne&s;s of light in which the channels of righteou&s;ne&s;s are opened, and ju&s;tice done to

tho&s;e who remain &s;ilent under injuries: here I have &s;een under humbling exerci&s;e of mind, that the &s;ins of the fathers are embraced by the children, and become their &s;ins, and thus in the days of tribulation, the iniquities of the fathers are vi&s;ited upon the&s;e children, who take hold of the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of their fathers, and live in that &s;pirit in which tho&s;e iniquities were committed; to which agreeth the prophecy of Mo&s;es, concerning a rebel|lious people. <Q>They that are left of you &s;hall pine away in their iniquities, in your enemy's land, and in the iniquities of their fathers &s;hall they pine away.</Q> Lev. xxvi. 39. and our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in beholding the hard|ne&s;s of heart in that generation, and feeling in him&s;elf, that they lived in the &s;ame &s;pirit in which the prophets had been per&s;ecuted unto death, &s;ignified, <Q>that the blood of all the prophets which was &s;hed from the foundation of the world, &s;hould be requir|ed of that generation, from the blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, which peri&s;hed between the altar and the temple.</Q> Luke xi. 51.</P>
<P>Tender compa&s;&s;ion fills my heart toward my fellow creatures e&s;tranged from the har|monious government of the Prince of Peace, and a labour attends me, that they may be gathered to this peaceable habitation.</P>
<P>In being inwardly prepared to &s;uffer adver|&s;ity for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and weaned from a de|pendance on the arm of fle&s;h, we feel, that there is a re&s;t for the people of God, and

that it &s;tands in a perfect re&s;ignation of our|&s;elves to his holy Will; in this condition, all our wants and de&s;ires are bounded by pure wi&s;dom, and our minds wholly attentive to the council of Chri&s;t inwardly communicated, which hath appeared to me as a habitation of &s;afety for the Lord's people, in times of outward commotion and trouble, and de&s;ires from the fountain of pure love, are opened in me, to invite my brethren and fellow creatures to feel for, and &s;eek after that which gathers the mind into it.</P>
