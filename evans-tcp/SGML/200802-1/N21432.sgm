<HEAD>Mechanics' Lecture.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE find recorded in the &s;acred Scripture, that he who had but one talent, <HI>went and hid it in the earth.</HI> But I, though I have but half a talent, am de|termined to u&s;e it to the be&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>Much of your time and money has been already &s;pent in hearing LECTURES.&mdash;Lectures on philo&s;ophy&mdash;Lectures on grammar&mdash;Lectures on languages, both dead and living, have been delivered. Lectures on heads, and hearts, have been heard with great applau&s;e. Lectures on politics, from New-Hamp&s;hire to Georgia&mdash;yea, from beyond Babylon, from China to Chippawa, have &s;ounded in our ears. Long lectures on law are daily delivered, to the great perplexity of all jurymen. Lectures on phy&s;ic, or, more learnedly, upon <HI>materia medica,</HI> &s;ome of you may have heard; and our churches echo and re-echo with lectures on divinity.&mdash;But no lecture, to my knowledge, has been delivered to ME|CHANICS worthy to engage their attention:&mdash;I, there|fore, who had the good fortune to be born the &s;on of a mechanic, have taken on me the important ta&s;k of lec|turing to that re&s;pectable part of the community.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted, gentlemen MECHANICS, that you po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e &s;entiments of candor, and genero&s;ity, which are more ready to excu&s;e faults than to impute them, even where they really are, I do the more chear|fully &s;peak.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028154_0004_0FD83FD1E6F52118">
I &s;hall attempt to treat of your different profe&s;&s;ions &s;eparately; though it cannot be expected that every profe&s;&s;ion will be fully treated of. <HI>My abilities are un|equal, abilities &s;uperior to mine would be unequal, to &s;uch a ta&s;k.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall therefore dwell, only on tho&s;e branches which appear mo&s;t important, and nece&s;&s;ary to the good of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Were I addre&s;&s;ing an audience of country gentlemen, on the plea&s;ing &s;ubject of agriculture, I &s;hould probably begin with our fir&s;t parents, Adam and Eve, in their primogenial &s;tate:&mdash;But, when I have the honor of addre&s;&s;ing MECHANICS, and treating of ARCHITECTURE, the &s;ublime &s;ubject requires that I begin long before the days of Adam:&mdash;for who but an all-wi&s;e and omnipo|tent ARCHITECT, could plan the heavens, and bring into exi&s;tence an univer&s;e of worlds! In the language of the poet,
<Q><L><HI>All nature is but</HI> ART <HI>unknown to thee,</HI></L>
<L><HI>All</HI> chance, DIRECTION! <HI>which thou can&s;t not &s;ee.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Ca&s;t your thoughts back into eternity! There, before creation began, the philo&s;ophic eye di&s;covers an infinite maze, which the wi&s;dom of man is unable to compre|hend. All then was one continued ocean of <HI>chaes, without a bottom, and without a &s;hare; the centre of which was every where, and the circumference no where.</HI> God, the great Architect of worlds was the centre: He, by infinite wi&s;dom, called that glorious luminary the &s;un into exi&s;tence; then, with his almighty compa&s;&s;es, &s;wept the circling path of every world. He was the fir&s;t MECHANIC. He laid the foundation of the earth, that it &s;hould never be removed; and it was HE who &s;pread the beautiful curtains of heaven, be&s;pangled with brilliant &s;tars.&mdash;"When we con&s;ider the hea|vens, the work of his fingers, the &s;un and the &s;tars, which he hath ordained," we are filled with the &s;ame
<PB N="5" REF="028154_0005_0FD83FD3182A3FB0">
&s;entiments of adoration which impelled good old David to cry cut&mdash;<HI>Lord! what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the &s;on of man that thou vi&s;ite&s;t him!</HI> By one all &s;ublime ARCHITECT, the heavens were framed&mdash;worlds, mountains, rivers, bea&s;ts, and birds, were made; and by the &s;ame Almighty MECHANIC man was formed&mdash;and to crown the whole, woman being taken from man, came forth double refined, the mo&s;t perfect work of all creation. Here we ob&s;erve, that, the Almighty did, not only plan his own work, but did execute it Him&s;elf. This may &s;erve to us as a perpetual example of indu&s;try:&mdash;for if the Deity Him&s;elf, did not think it degrading his character to labour, how de&s;picable mu&s;t that man appear who de&s;pi&s;es labour, or a labourer!</P>
<P>I now proceed to con&s;ider mortal man as a MECHAN|IC. The fir&s;t man and woman were at the beginning gardeners; for we read, that <HI>they were put into the gar|den of Eden, to keep it and to dre&s;s it.</HI> But when the cu|rio&s;ity of Eve, prompted by the devil, had ruined for ever her peace of mind; hone&s;t Adam, like every fond hu&s;band, grieved at the pen&s;ive tears of his beloved rib, could not endure to &s;ee her unhappy alone; and know|ing that mi&s;ery loves company, he al&s;o ta&s;ted the deli|cious mor&s;el. Then, and not till then, they di&s;covered their want of clothes. Nece&s;&s;ity, the mother of cun|ning ARTS, &s;oon put it into their heads to few fig-leaves together, by which they furni&s;hed them&s;elves with a|prons. Thus we &s;ee that the fir&s;t man was a MECHAN|IC. And what was his trade?&mdash;A TAYLOR!&mdash;and his wi&s;e a taylore&s;s; for they both &s;ewed.&mdash;I know it has been a common &s;aying, that it takes nine taylors to make one man; but we find the truth is, that one taylor was the father of all men. Kings and queens, princes and prince&s;&s;es, emperors and nabobs, lords and beggars, are all the de&s;cendants of one TAYLOR!!&mdash;If we could
<PB N="6" REF="028154_0006_0FD83FD4984184B8">
be brought to reali&s;e this truth, with what reverence &s;hould we bow to that ancient and venerable order of the <HI>needle and thread!</HI> I know it will be argued by <HI>needle|makers,</HI> that before Adam could &s;ew he mu&s;t have had a needle. But we may &s;uppo&s;e that a <HI>thorn,</HI> with a piece of tough bark an&s;wered for the fir&s;t needle and thread.</P>
<P>I &s;hall attempt to draw &s;ome good in&s;truction from each trade as I pa&s;s along. The fig-leaves, you know could have an&s;wered but little purpo&s;e alone; but a number of them joined together, did an&s;wer a <HI>very good purpo&s;e.</HI> This teaches us, that man can be of little &s;er|vice to the world while alone, but being united, nothing is too hard for him to accompli&s;h. Even one man pro|perly united was capable of peopling the whole world!</P>
<P>As it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a taylor to &s;ew many pieces together, in order to make one garment; &s;o in &s;ociety, let them endeavor to &s;ew every member together in or|der to promote the general good&mdash;to unite neighbors together, with the ba&s;ting threads of love, and &s;ew them fa&s;t with the cords of virtue: But, cut off all the frag|ments and tatters of &s;ociety, with the &s;hears of denial; &s;tab the wicked with the &s;harp bodkins of con&s;cience, and pre&s;s down tyranny with an iron goo&s;e.</P>
<P>That which was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary was fir&s;t attended to, namely, an apron: and after our fir&s;t parents had given them&s;elves a tolerable &s;uit of fig-leaves, 'tis probable the next thing that claimed their attention, was a hou&s;e, to &s;creen them from the inclement &s;torms. A hollow tree might have an&s;wered for a &s;hort time, but as that could not have been convenient, a hou&s;e mu&s;t have been built. Now in building a hou&s;e, gentlemen, which mechanic is fir&s;t employed?&mdash;Certainly the</P>

<HEAD>MASON.</HEAD>
<P>The ma&s;on lays the foundation, and without a foun|dation you know the building could not &s;tand.&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="028154_0007_0FD83FD6192DFBE0">
There is a &s;ociety &s;cattered abroad over the earth, which call them&s;elves <HI>free ma&s;ons</HI>&mdash;yet &s;ome of them are the greate&s;t &s;laves in the world; and &s;laves to the wor&s;t of ma&s;ters, pa&s;&s;ion and vice. Can &s;uch be called Free Ma|&s;ons? No: but every MASON in Penn&s;ylvania, who is twenty-one years old, is truly a <HI>free ma&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The art of ma&s;onry we find to be very ancient; for, to &s;ay nothing of the foundations of the earth, laid by the fir&s;t grand ma&s;ter ma&s;on, we &s;hall begin with the mighty tower of Babel.</P>
<P>Men fearing that a flood of waters would again deluge the earth, for their mutual &s;afety, a&s;&s;embled together, and formed one grand congre&s;s of the world: at which they agreed to build a tower, <HI>who&s;e top &s;hould reach hea|ven;</HI> that when the waters &s;hould come again, they might fly thereto and be &s;afe. And what but the &s;olid work of MASONS could be deemed &s;ufficient to lay the foundation of &s;uch a work!&mdash;Stones formed by the hand of Nature, being the mo&s;t permanent of all ma|terials, were probably made u&s;e of to lay the foundation of this mighty fabric. But here the ambitious views of man were bla&s;ted.&mdash;The Almighty King of heaven and earth, who knows be&s;t what is good for man, would not &s;uffer him in his mortal &s;tate, thus to &s;cale the walls of heaven. HE, being perfect ma&s;ter of all lan|guages, as well as arts and &s;ciences, de&s;cended from his lofty throne and confounded the language of man; and introduced new languages which the &s;ons of men could not under&s;tand. This alone was &s;ufficient to fru&s;trate their de&s;ign; for when the ma&s;ons called for mortar, the attendants brought &s;tone; and when they called for &s;tone, the attendants brought mortar. Their words founded as uncouth to one another, as dead languages found now-a-days to living ears. Mad and perplexed at their own confu&s;ed jargon, "they left off to build,"
<PB N="8" REF="028154_0008_0FD83FDB3957EE80">
and &s;eparating from each other, &s;pread them&s;elves over the face of the earth, and laid the foundations of cities.</P>
<P>The pyramids of Egypt, tho&s;e amazing piles, which has been the a&s;toni&s;hment of many ages, and which &s;eem to bid defiance, even to time it&s;elf, none but Ma|&s;ons could build. That &s;tupenduous wall which &s;epa|rates China from Tartary, fifteen hundred miles in length, very thick and very high, was built by the ma|&s;ons of China, to prevent the incur&s;ions of the Tartarian robbers. It has already borne the &s;torms, of more than eighteen hundred years, and will probably remain the admiration of many ages yet unborn.</P>
<P>The magnificent walls of Babylon, have been much celebrated by hi&s;torians; but the wild ambition of a ty|rant warrior, levelled them to the ground. Though the plan of this famous city of Philadelphia, &s;o ju&s;tly ad|mired for its regularity, was drawn from ancient Bab|ylon; yet it was you, gentlemen Ma&s;ons, and your fa|thers, who laid its foundations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="profession">
<HEAD>CARPENTERS.</HEAD>
<P>Much is due to Ma&s;ons for laying foundations and rai&s;ing walls; but without CARPENTERS, their work would be incomplete; for a hou&s;e, without a roof, would be but a poor &s;helter, and without the in&s;ide work would be but a &s;hell. Though you might build a hou&s;e, yet it would &s;moke without a chimney; and a &s;moky hou&s;e always makes a &s;colding wife; and two &s;uch evils would be intolerable: Therefore you cannot build a hou&s;e complete, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ma|&s;ons; but a &s;table perhaps you may. And a &s;table, we are informed, was the birth-place of the Prince of Car|penters; that divine Mechanic, who taught men that profe&s;&s;ion alone, was not &s;ufficient to &s;upport them, ei|ther in this world, or the world to come. HE broke off the &s;hackles of &s;uper&s;tition, which had long been rivet|ted
<PB N="9" REF="028154_0009_0FD83FDC0C4403C0">
on the minds of men; and taught, that true religion con&s;i&s;ted in <HI>doing to others tho&s;e things which we would that others &s;hould do unto us.</HI> HE, by divine precepts, by his moral life, and virtuous examples, is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the Saviour of men. This was the CARPENTER, the &s;on of Jo&s;eph. His abilities were too great, and his genius too exten&s;ive, to be confined to wood: He there|fore laid by peri&s;hable things, and, with divine wi&s;dom, framed a building, wide as the world, deep as its cen|tre, and more durable than pillars of bra&s;s. <HI>The &s;tars &s;hall fade away, the &s;un him&s;elf grow dim with age, and nature find in years,</HI> but this building, founded on truth, &s;hall &s;tand &s;ecure <HI>amid&s;t the war of elements, the wreck of matter, and the cru&s;h of worlds.</HI></P>
<P>What profe&s;&s;ion of mechanics can boa&s;t of a building capable to outride the tempe&s;t of an univer&s;al deluge? None but carpenters can &s;hare this glory; and Ship|Carpenters only. Noah the great &s;hip-wright of the old world, was the man highly favored of God. He had ability to con&s;truct a &s;hip &s;ufficient to buffet the foaming billows of an angry &s;ea, that &s;pread death and de&s;truction all around. While he, with his family, rode unconcerned above the drowning world; and from the antedeluvian &s;hores landed &s;afely on the mountain of Ararat.</P>
<P>'Tis needle&s;s to dwell on the many advantages ari&s;ing to the world from carpenters. Each of us feel our ob|ligations to them, while in our hou&s;es we are &s;creened from the wintry bla&s;t! Securely we may fit and defy the angry &s;torm driving at our windows. To them the &s;ailer is indebted for his winged dwelling while he plows the ocean. Commerce proclaims your utility to the world, for you are the life of merchants. Yonder HALL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia.</HI></NOTE> &s;tands a monument of your indu&s;try; and we
<PB N="10" REF="028154_0010_0FD83FDD8E81BEC0">
hope it may long &s;tand to perpetuate the memory of its virtuous founders, to their virtuous po&s;terity. In that hall was a&s;&s;embled the fir&s;t Congre&s;s of the American world: that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, who, like good carpen|ters, framed the thirteen &s;tates into one united empire.</P>
<P>As it is your bu&s;ine&s;s, gentlemen carpenters, of many pieces to form one complete frame; &s;o let it be your care, not only to make the frame of government as perfect as po&s;&s;ible, but often to examine it, and &s;ee that none of the timbers become defective. You, together with ma&s;ons, are the proper per&s;ons to examine frames and foundations.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your trades cannot be con&s;idered in &s;o fundamental a light as carpenters and ma&s;ons; yet, they will readily grant, that their work is not complete till the Joiner gives it the fini&s;hing &s;troke. Let it be your care to join brethren, and cement them together like a glue joint.</P>
<P>As cabinet-making is a branch of bu&s;ine&s;s more par|ticularly intere&s;ting to the Ladies, I &s;hall now addre&s;s the makers of tables, trunks, drawers, &amp;c. As your work is for the ladies, it is and ought to be the genteel|e&s;t of all wooden work. With what plea&s;ure do you fini&s;h a chair, knowing who is to &s;it in it? With what neatne&s;s do you fini&s;h a ca&s;e of drawers, knowing what fine things are to re&s;t in them? And with what anxiety does a young journeyman fini&s;h the head-board of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary part of a bride's furniture?&mdash;As you are employed in the &s;ervice of the ladies, I think your la|bour mu&s;t be a continual plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We have this inference to draw from your trade; that, in all ages of the world, and in all kingdoms, the wi&s;e&s;t men have, or ought to have been concerned in the CABINET. Solomon, with all his wi&s;dom, mu&s;t

<P>But you, as well as all other mechanics, are greatly indebted to the <HI>Smiths:</HI> I therefore now turn more im|mediately to you</P>

<HEAD>GENTLEMEN SMITHS, BOTH BLACK AND WHITE.</HEAD>
<P>The conveniences and advantages, ari&s;ing to all me|chanics from the labour of your hands are very great.&mdash;But &s;uffer me to depart a little from the direct chain of my di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;Curio&s;ity is natural to the &s;oul of man as well as woman; and perhaps &s;ome may be curious to know whether the author of this Lecture &s;prung from a good family or not. Now I care not a &s;traw whether a man &s;prung from a lord or a beggar, provided he be a good man: but &s;ome people con&s;ider a man worthy or unworthy, not according to his vir|tues and vices, but according to his family. If he chance to be from a high family, that makes ample a|mends for all his vices.&mdash;To make this digre&s;&s;ion, gentlemen, I have the example of the great and learned Dr. S&mdash;s, pre&s;ident of Yale college. In a &s;ermon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This &s;ermon, we are informed is depo&s;ited in a Mu&s;eum in the city of London, as a great curio&s;ity.</HI></NOTE> at the clo&s;e of the late war, which he delivered before the General A&s;&s;embly of Connecticut, were the&s;e words, "O England, I once loved thee with the duty of a &s;on; for I am a de&s;cendent of thy nobles, and the fourth from Sir <HI>Adam Knapton."</HI> In imitation of this polite philo&s;|opher and patriotic &s;age, I have informed you, that I had the honour to be born the &s;on of a mechanic. I cannot boa&s;t nobility of blood from an ancient race of profligate lords; yet I boa&s;t of blood more noble&mdash;for
<PB N="12" REF="028154_0012_0FD83FE3744A3EE8">
my father was a BLACKSMITH. And though I am not able to trace back his pedigree, through the dark ages of monki&s;h ignorance; yet I have no doubt but he was a de&s;cendant from <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> that philo&s;oper of philo&s;|ophers, that great Black&s;mith, who to his immortal hon|our, by &s;miting on his anvil, fir&s;t di&s;covered the har|mony of &s;ounds. He di&s;covered that &s;ounds were grave or acute, in proportion to the weight of his anvil: by which mu&s;ic, that mo&s;t divine and plea&s;ing of all &s;cien|ces, has been greatly improved. He was probably the &s;on of Tubal Cain, the fir&s;t man who was cunning e|nough to work in bra&s;s and iron: And Tubal Cain mu&s;t have been a near relation of Jubal, the grand&s;on of A|dam, who was the fir&s;t, according to Mo&s;es, that ever played on the harp and organ. Thus, gentlemen, you &s;ee that I am de&s;cended from a family as ancient as that of the kings of England, and a race as much more no|ble, as their virtues were &s;uperior.</P>
<P>But to return to you, gentlemen Smiths, I have before ob&s;erved, that the advantages ari&s;ing to all mechanics from the labour of your hands are very great:&mdash;without you, they could do nothing. You furni&s;h the lords of the &s;oil with plow&s;hares, by which they are enabled to feed the world with bread. You furni&s;h the &s;oldier with weapons to defend his country, and he, when oc|ca&s;ion requires, &s;tands ready to beat down the foe. If a few Black&s;miths, with red hot nail-rods, could van|qui&s;h a legion of Briti&s;h troops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Some years ago, when a Briti&s;h regiment of Scot&s;men were &s;tationed in this city a fray happened between &s;ome of them and a number of black&s;miths.

It is &s;aid in the heathen theology, that you are the de&s;cendents of Vulcan, god of &s;ubterranean fires, and that he came from heaven, and &s;et up a &s;mith's &s;hop in the i&s;land of Lemnos, where he forged thunder bolts for his father Jupiter. Whether this &s;tory be true or not, it matters not;&mdash;but certain it is, that you have power to heap live coals of fire on the heads of your en|emies; and you can &s;often &s;teel, which is harder than a lady's heart. You have the advantage of all other profe&s;&s;ions; for &s;hould the <HI>iron</HI> hand of poverty bear hard upon you, you can &s;ell even your <HI>vi&s;es</HI> for bread! You can hammer the harde&s;t metals into what &s;hape you plea&s;e; and none know &s;o well as you do, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of <HI>&s;triking while the iron is hot.</HI></P>
<P>As the cinders &s;eparate from the pure iron, &s;o let the wicked be &s;eparated from all your &s;ocieties.

<P>I have been at a lo&s;s whether to con&s;ider Barbers in the line of Mechanics, or to cla&s;s them with the nobility;&mdash;but when I &s;ee a head come from under their hands, I can no longer doubt of their proceeding by mechanical operations. Though the nature of their profe&s;&s;ion &s;eems more &s;uitable to the genius of an <HI>ari&s;tocracy,</HI> than to that of a republican government; yet, as a race of no|bility is repugnant to the nature of our con&s;titution, I &s;hall con&s;ider that very <HI>numerous</HI> part of the community among the order of good citizens.</P>
<P>You, gentlemen Barbers, often give the empty head of an empty &s;op, the white appearance of a wi&s;e &s;age. You <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> upon many a blockhead, &s;ome of which can feel <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hot irons and &s;harp pins, and &s;ome cannot. The beau is not complete till you give him the fini&s;hing touch;&mdash;then he &s;allies forth like a butterfly, the gaudy being of a &s;ummer's day.</P>
<P>Your ingenuity and u&s;efulne&s;s appears mo&s;t con&s;pic|uous in the <HI>carding machine;</HI> which is the invention of one of your fraternity in England. Studying out the plan of a machine for craping hair more expeditiou&s;ly, he had the happine&s;s to hit on the carding machine, greatly to the improvement of cotton manufactories.</P>

I am not well enough acquainted with the hi&s;tory of Barbers to trace out their pedigree, or to enumerate many of their heroic deeds; one alone is &s;ufficient to hand them down in the li&s;t of high &s;ame, to the late&s;t po&s;terity;&mdash;for when the united power of the Phili&s;tines was not &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the intrepid Samp&s;on, one Barber could &s;have his head, and render him weak like another man. Thus, he who had the dexterity to catch three hundred foxes; the &s;trength to tear a lion in pieces; to carry away the gates of Gaza on his &s;houl|ders, bars and all; to lay three thou&s;and men dead in <HI>heaps upon heaps,</HI> with the jaw bone of an a&s;s; and to pull down a huge play hou&s;e at one jerk; he who could do all this, fell by the hand of a Barber!!!</P>

<HEAD>WEAVERS</HEAD>
<P>Are a cla&s;s of men very u&s;eful in the world; and we are all under great obligations to them, for our fine clothes, and our warm clothes.</P>
<P>Fig-leaves could an&s;wer only for a temporary dre&s;s: but as &s;oon as Eve had learnt to &s;pin, the ingenuity of Seth contrived to weave what his mother had &s;pun. No<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> I only conjecture; and why may not I be allowed to make &s;ome conjectures, as well as another preacher? Seth then we conclude was the fir&s;t Weaver. So if this be true, and I have heard no one doubt it, Weavers mu&s;t be very ancient. Fine linen, we read, was manufactured in Egypt at an early period.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable has occurred to my memory, re&s;pecting WEAVERS in the bloody fields of battle. This indicates their peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, which is in|finitely more commendable than the character of tho&s;e who are <HI>full of &s;trange caths, and bearded like the pard, jealous in honour, &s;udden and quick in quarrel, &s;eeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon's mouth.</HI>&mdash;Yet I make no doubt but they are as ready as others, to &s;tand

<P>Afflicted Job compares the life of man to a weaver's &s;huttle: and very ju&s;tly, for life, like the thread from your &s;huttle, is con&s;tantly &s;pinning off. Similar to this were the divine &s;entiments of Plato, when he &s;aid,
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>"The &s;cepter'd king, the burden'd &s;lave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The humble and the haughty die;</HI></L>

<L><HI>And all their glories are no more!</HI></L>

<L><HI>So through the air the meteor flies,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And &s;preads along its gilded train;</HI></L>
<L><HI>When &s;hat&mdash;'tis gone; its beauty dies&mdash;</HI></L>

<L><HI>So 'tis with us&mdash;"</HI></L>

<P>And &s;ince we imitate the meteor, in the &s;hortne&s;s of our lives; let us al&s;o, like the meteor, while we do live, give light to all around us.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ion of Weavers, we mu&s;t conclude, was in high repute in England, at the birth of the Briti&s;h Spectator; for in one of the&s;e celebrated volumes we find recorded the following epitaph:
<Q><L>"Here lies Daniel Saul;</L>
<L>Spittalfield's WEAVER&mdash;and that's <HI>all!"</HI></L></Q>
That is, <HI>all</HI> that he ought to be. When a great lord a|mong men dies, we often &s;ee a long &s;tring of epitaph, enumerating a thou&s;and virtues which he never had; and which no body will believe he had. But when the poet &s;peaks of the Weaver, he &s;ays, <HI>Spittalfield's weaver,
<PB N="17" REF="028154_0017_0FD83FF68F1213F8">
and that's all.</HI> All that is good, he undoubtedly meant; all that he ought to be.</P>
<P>As your <HI>web,</HI> gentlemen Weavers, can be of no &s;er|vice until it is woven; &s;o neither can a number of peo|ple accompli&s;h any thing of con&s;equence until they are united. Be it therefore your care, not only to warp and weave your cloth well together; but al&s;o to do your en|deavor to warp men into principles of virtue, ju&s;tice, and morality.</P>

<HEAD>FULLERS.</HEAD>
<P>The Fuller is only improving and fini&s;hing what the Weaver began; and notwith&s;tanding the pounding and noi&s;e they make, could have no bu&s;ine&s;s were it not for the Weavers.</P>
<P>I can give information of nothing remarkable re&s;pect|ing Fullers. But a fulling-<HI>mill</HI> was once known to frighten, not only poor <HI>Sancho,</HI> who was naturally tim|orous, but &s;truck terror to the courageous heart of Den Quixote de la Mancha. After his bloody engagement with the wind-mill, he was under trembling apprehen|&s;ions from the thumps of a fulling-mill; until his faith|ful &s;quire Sancho informed his wor&s;hip there was no harm.</P>
<P>A Fuller never returns &s;o many yards of cloth as he receives; but what he lo&s;es in length and breadth, he makes up in thickne&s;s. "This is as true, <HI>as &s;aid a preacher,</HI> as that logwood will die hats."</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="profession">
<HEAD>HATTERS.</HEAD>
<P>The Hatter's trade, is, in nature, much the &s;ame as that of the Fuller; only that the Hatter always keeps his apprentices and journeymen in <HI>hot water.</HI> This can|not be imputed to ill nature, neither; for I once knew a Hatter the be&s;t natured man that could be. Coming home late in the night, unexpectedly, he found a Briti&s;h officer in the hou&s;e: yet he retained his good nature,

<P>TANNERS were &s;ome of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians at Joppa; for we read that St. Peter lodged there <HI>with one Simon a tanner:</HI> and doubtle&s;s Simon the Tanner was a very zealous Chri&s;tian, or el&s;e St. Peter would not have a&s;&s;o|ciated with him.</P>
<P>We al&s;o read in another hi&s;tory, written, if I mi&s;take not, by the renowned E&s;op, that Tanners, anciently, were &s;ome of the fir&s;t politicians; for, &s;ays that great and crooked backt hi&s;torian, "when a town was in dan|ger of being be&s;ieged, the wi&s;e inhabitants held a con|&s;ultation which was the be&s;t method to fortify it:
<Q><L><HI>A grave &s;killful</HI> MASON <HI>gave in his opinion,</HI></L>

<P>Here I mu&s;t remark, that the word Tanner is by &s;ome tran&s;lators, rendered Currier; but I find it is all one in

the original Creek. Yet in this in&s;tance I think it ought to be tran&s;lated Tanner; becau&s;e, had they agreed to fortify the town with leather, it need not have been curried; and be&s;ides, the leather mu&s;t have fir&s;t come from the Tanner. In this I have the decided opinion of the famous Vatt Barkooze, fir&s;t Tanner in the city of Leatherhide; as al&s;o of the great Mr. Tanooze, who &s;erved a faithful apprentice&s;hip with Barkooze; and he was a very pious and learned man.</P>

<HEAD>SADDLERS.</HEAD>
<P>Every &s;addler, who is ma&s;ter of his bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t know what kind of a curb is nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train the rage of an unruly hor&s;e; and the &s;trength of a rein re|qui&s;ite for that curb. This mu&s;t lead him into reflec|tions highly favourable to the rulers of a people. He &s;ees the nece&s;&s;ity of curbs and reins to re&s;train the un|ruyl pa&s;&s;ions of men, &s;o as to prevent their injuring one another. He mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ee the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of having a &s;kilful man to hold tho&s;e reins.</P>
<P>If any one &s;hould di&s;pute the u&s;efulne&s;s of SADDLERS, let him ride a trotting hor&s;e then miles, bare-back, and that will reduce him to rea&s;on.</P>

<P>Add wings to commerce, while the ROPE MAKER, be&s;ides furni&s;hing Ju&s;tice with <HI>balters,</HI> gives &s;inews to the&s;e wings; without which our &s;hips would make but a heavy pa&s;&s;age through the deep. Saint Paul, that mo&s;t learned and ob&s;tinate of all Chri&s;tians, was a &s;ail maker; for we read in the eighteenth chapter of the Acts, that "Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth; and found a Jew named Aquilla, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Pri&s;cilla; and becau&s;e he was of the &s;ame craft he abode with them, and wrought (for by their occupation they were <HI>tent makers)"</HI>&mdash;or &s;ail makers;&mdash;which I &s;uppo&s;e is all one in the Greek.</P>

<HEAD>PRINTERS.</HEAD>
<P>To crown all the ARTS and SCIENCES, Printing was
<PB N="27" REF="028154_0027_0FD83FFF8203EA38">
invented about three hundred years ago, to the great improvement of literature. Before that time, all books were tediou&s;ly tran&s;cribed with a pen; con&s;equently the knowledge of letters could not be general among man|kind.</P>
<P>'Tis needle&s;s to expatiate on the many advantages a|ri&s;ing to the public from the knowledge which is diffu&s;ed among the people, by the ART of PAINTING. <HI>Liberty of the pre&s;s, and a favorite volume in &s;heets,</HI> is the prevail|ing &s;entiment of the enlightened Printers of the pre&s;ent age. Every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of its utility, and none but tyrants wi&s;h to re&s;train <HI>the liberty of the pre&s;s,</HI> while it is conducted with propriety.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to have recour&s;e to antiquity for charac|ters eminent in this profe&s;&s;ion. Poor Richard's Alma|nac alone, would be &s;ufficient to immortalize the whole fraternity,&mdash;to &s;ay nothing of its enlightened author:&mdash;who&s;e genius &s;o animating to the rights of man, has, like the &s;hock of <HI>electricity,</HI> rou&s;ed up the &s;pirit of liberty, and &s;truck off the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, which was bear|ing hard upon our country. The &s;hock of his electri|cal apparatus has been &s;en&s;ibly felt acro&s;s the Atlantic, and has made the thrones of tyrants &s;hake to their cen|tres. He yet lives,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This Lecture was written before</HI> Dr. FRANKLIN'S <HI>death.</HI></NOTE> ble&s;&s;ed be God, ju&s;tly exalted in that high &s;eat, where he &s;hines the Light of PHILOSO|PHERS, the Glory of PRINTERS, the Pride of MECHAN|ICS, and the brighte&s;t Ornament of HUMAN NATURE:&mdash;waiting, with philo&s;ophic patience, the happy mo|ment when he &s;hall ri&s;e above all earthly things, to &s;hine &s;uperior, a <HI>fixed &s;tar</HI> of the fir&s;t magnitude.</P>
