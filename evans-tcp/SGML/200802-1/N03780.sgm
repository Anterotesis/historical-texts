<P>_WENT this Morning with &s;ome Friends, to view a Tract of Land con&s;i&s;ting of 500 Acres, which Mr. <HI>H&mdash;m,</HI> whom I left School-Ma&s;ter of <HI>Savannah,</HI> was directed, I hope by Provi|dence, to make Choice of for the <HI>Orphan-Hou&s;e.</HI> It is &s;ituated on the northern Part of the Colony, about 10 Miles off <HI>Savannah,</HI> and has various Kinds of Soil in it, a great Part of it very good.

Provi&s;ion from the Tru&s;tees, yet treated in a Manner unbecoming even Heathens. Was all the Money I have collected, to be &s;pent in freeing the&s;e Three Children from Slavery, it would be well laid out.

Ble&s;&s;ed be</HI> GOD, <HI>they begin to live in Order.</HI>.</P>
<P>This Day I began the Cotton Manu|factury; and agreed with a Woman to teach the litle Ones to &s;pin and card. I find annual Cotton grows indifferently well in <HI>Georgia</HI>: And, to encourage the People, I this Day bought 305 <HI>lb.</HI> and have agreed to take all the Cotton, Hemp and Flax that &s;hall be planted the follow|ing Year, through the whole Province.

Tho' there are fewer Inhabitants, yet, I think the People are in a better Situation than when I was here la&s;t. They now live independant on a Publick Store, Provi&s;ions (Flour e&s;pecial|ly) are much cheaper; Cattle more plen|tiful; and by the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing, if any Manufacture can be rai&s;ed among&s;t them|&s;elves,

to prevent their exporting &s;o much Money, they may yet do well. I ble&s;s GOD! My Congregations are as large as u&s;ual. The Court-Hou&s;e is generally full, and I keep as near as may be to my old Way of Proceeding. We have the Sacrament every Sunday, and publick Prayer and Expo&s;ition twice every Day in the Week. <HI>The LORD ble&s;s my Com|ing, and grant the Inhabitants may know the Things which belong to their Peace, be|fore they are eternally hid from their Eyes!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, January</HI> 30. Went to Day with the Carpenter and Surveyor, and laid out the Ground whereon the Orphan-Hou&s;e is to be built. It is to be &s;ixty feet long, and forty wide: A Yard and Garden before and behind: The Foundation is to be Brick, and is to be &s;unk four Feet with|in, and rai&s;ed three Feet above the Ground, which is intended for a Cellar and other convenient Places. The Hou&s;e is to be two Story, with a Hip-Roof, the Fir&s;t ten the Second nine Foot high. In all there will be near twenty commodious Rooms. Behind are two &s;mall Hou&s;es, the one for an Infirmary, the other for a Charity-School for the poor Children of the Town that are not Orphans; for I intend to take in &s;ome of them, as my Stock will admit. There is al&s;o to be a Still-Hou&s;e

I find it will be an expen&s;ive Work: But it is for the LORD CHRIST; He will take care to defray all Charges.&mdash; The Money that will be &s;pent on this Occa&s;ion, will keep many Families from leaving the Colony; and in all Probability bring many others over.&mdash; There are near thirty working at the Plantation already, and I would employ as many more, if they could be got.&mdash; What&s;oever is done for GOD ought to be done &s;peedily, as well as with all our Might.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Feb,</HI> 4. Met according to Appointment with all the Magi&s;trates, and former Tru&s;tee of the Orphans, who heard the Recorder read over the Grant given me by the Tru&s;tees, and took a Minute of their Approbation of the &s;ame, <HI>LORD grant I may carefully watch over every Soul that is, or &s;hall be committed to my Charge!</HI></P>

After I had been there a little while, I told him, That I was inform'd, he had &s;ome Que&s;tions to propo&s;e to me, and that I was now come to give him all the Satisfaction I could in an&s;wering them.

<Q>Yes Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I have &s;everal Que&s;tions to put to you, but, <HI>added he,</HI> you are got above us,</Q>
or &s;omething to that Purpo&s;e. Then he charged me with <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and Pride, for &s;peaking again&s;t the Generality of the Clergy, and de&s;ired I would make my Charge good. I told him, I thought I had already; but, as yet, I had &s;carce begun with them. He then a&s;ked me, Wherein were the Clergy &s;o much to blame?

me. I replied, I &s;hall regard that as much as I would a Pope's Bull. But, Sir, &s;ays I, why &s;hould you be offended at my &s;peaking again&s;t the Generality of the Clergy, for I always &s;poke worthily of you?&mdash;I might as well be offended, ad|ded my Brother, at your &s;aying, the Ge|nerality of People were notorious Sinners, and might come to accu&s;e you, for &s;peak|ing Evil of me, becau&s;e I was one of the People. I further added, Sir, you did not behave thus, when I was with you la&s;t. No, &s;ays he, you did not &s;peak again&s;t the Clergy; or &s;ome &s;uch Thing. Becau&s;e, replied I, more Light has been given me &s;ince that time: But if you will make an Application to your&s;elf, be plea&s;ed, Sir, to let me a&s;k you one Que&s;tion.
<Q>Have you delivered your Soul, by exclaiming again&s;t the A&s;&s;emblies and Balls here? What, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> mu&s;t you come to catechi&s;e me? No, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I have not exclaim'd again&s;t them; I think there is no Harm in them. Then, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I &s;hall think it my Duty to ex|claim again&s;t you.

Upon which I made my Bow, and, with my Friends, took my Leave, pitying the Commi&s;&s;ary, who I really tho't was more noble than to

<P>At our coming to <HI>Flat-Bu&s;h</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters received me with all Civility, and gave me the U&s;e of their Church. There were al&s;o Seven or Eight Di&s;&s;ent|ing Mini&s;ters pre&s;ent. I fearce was ever enabled to &s;peak of the Doctrines of <HI>Grace</HI> with greater Freedom and Clearne&s;s.

<P>About Two in the Afternoon, having a fair Wind, we returned to <HI>New-York,</HI> where I received another comfortable Packet of Letters from <HI>Charles-Town</HI> and <HI>Savannah,</HI> among&s;t which were Two or Three from my little Orphans, which gave me no &s;mall Plea&s;ure.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, May</HI> 8. Had what my Body much wanted, a thorough Night's Repo&s;e.

to bring home by my Preaching, when here la&s;t. The Account he gave of GOD's dealing with him, was very &s;atis|factory.

Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> he had Hopes of, but his Brother Traders en|deavoured to prejudice them again&s;t him: However, by my Advice, he propo&s;es vi|&s;iting them again next Fall; and I hum|bly hope the LORD will open a Door a|mong&s;t the poor Heathen.

While &s;he was at Meeting, hearing one Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n,</HI> a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Preacher, whom the LORD has

been plea&s;ed lately to &s;end forth, the Word came with &s;uch Power upon her Heart, that at la&s;t &s;he was obliged to cry out; and a great Concern al&s;o fell upon many in the Congregation, &s;o that they betook them&s;elves to &s;ecret Prayer. The Mini&s;ter &s;topped, and &s;everal per&s;uaded her to hold her Peace; but the Glory of the LORD &s;hone &s;o brightly round about her, that &s;he could not help ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing GOD, and telling how GOD was revealing him&s;elf to her Soul. After &s;ome time, &s;he was taken out of the Meet|ing-Hou&s;e, but &s;he fell upon her Knees prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing GOD. She conti|nued in an Agony for &s;ome con&s;iderable Time, and afterwards came in and heard the remaining Part of the Sermon. Ma|ny, &s;ince this, have called her mad, and &s;aid &s;he was full of new Wine: But, the Account &s;he gave me of her&s;elf, was ra|tional and &s;olid; and I believe, in that Hour the LORD JESUS took greater Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Soul. Such Ca&s;es are not very common; but when an extraor|dinary Work is carrying on, GOD ge|nerally manife&s;ts him&s;elf to &s;ome Souls in this extraordinary Manner.

<Q>And the LORD had Com|pa&s;&s;ion on the Multitude, becau&s;e they were &s;catter'd abroad, as Sheep having no Shepherd.</Q>

that I brought over, was enabled to wre&s;|tle with GOD exceedingly, both for him&s;elf and others. About Four GOD gave me to pray inten&s;ly and particularly, with &s;trong Crying and Tears, for my Friends who were in the Room with me. Many came into the Pa&s;&s;age near us, and wept much before the LORD, labouring much in their Souls. After this I went up and prayed, for near half an Hour, with &s;ome of the Women of the Hou&s;e, and three Girls, who &s;eemed to be weary with the Weight of their Sins. But when we were at publick Prayer, the HOLY GHOST &s;eem'd to come into the Congregation, like a mighty ru&s;hing Wind, carrying all before it.

Be|ing come Home, I laid my&s;elf on the Bed, weak in Body and a&s;toni&s;h'd at the Power of GOD; but finding &s;o many come up in &s;uch a Condition, I ro&s;e from the Bed, and betook my&s;elf unto Prayer again; but had not I lifted up my Voice like a Trum|pet, the Groans and Cries of the Chil|dren and People would have prevented my being heard.
