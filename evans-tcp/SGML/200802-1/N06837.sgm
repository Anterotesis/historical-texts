<Q>&mdash;<HI>SHALL there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT deva&s;tation have we lately &s;een made in a few hours! How many hou&s;es, and other buildings, &s;uddenly con&s;umed! How much wealth de&s;troyed! How many un|happy families, rich and poor together, left de&s;titute of any habitation, except tho&s;e which either private friend&s;hip, or public charity &s;upplied! What di&s;tre&s;s in every face; &s;ome mourning their own unhappy lot, others tenderly &s;ympathizing with them; and none knowing when, or where, the wide de&s;olation would terminate!</P>

<Q>AFFLICTION cometh not forth of the du&s;t, nei|ther doth trouble &s;pring out of the ground;</Q> to be &s;ure, not &s;uch trouble and affliction as this; a calami|ty, &s;o great and exten&s;ive! This is a vi&s;itation of pro|vidence, which demands a &s;erious and religious con|&s;ideration. And it is with a view to lead you into &s;ome proper reflexions on this melancholy occa&s;ion, that I have cho&s;en the words read, for the &s;ubject of my di&s;cour&s;e at this time: <Q>Shall there be evil in a city, &s;aith the prophet, and the LORD hath not done it?</Q></P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved, that altho' the&s;e words bear the form of a que&s;tion, the de&s;ign of them is &s;trongly to a&s;&s;ert, that there is no evil in a city, which the Lord hath not done. Interrogatory forms of expre&s;&s;ion, are often to be thus under&s;tood: I mean, as the mo&s;t peremptory, and animated kind of affirmations. Thus, for example, when it is demanded&mdash;<Q>Can a man take fire in his bo&s;om, and his cloaths not be burnt?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. VI. 27.</NOTE></Q> Every one under&s;tands this, as equivalent to a&s;&s;erting the impo&s;&s;ibility hereof in the &s;tronge&s;t terms. So, when it is a&s;ked, <Q>Can a man be profitable unto God?&mdash;Or is it gain to him, that thou make&s;t thy ways perfect? Will he reprove thee for fear of thee?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job XXII. 2, 3, 4.</NOTE></Q> A peremptory denial of the&s;e &s;everal things, is univer&s;ally under&s;tood by tho&s;e que&s;tions. As if it had been &s;aid, Verily, a man cannot be profita|table unto God! &amp;c. And when, after a repre&s;enta|tion of the great wickedne&s;s and depravity of the Jewi&s;h nation, it is immediately &s;ubjoined, <Q>Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e things? &s;aith the Lord: Shall not my &s;oul be avenged on &s;uch a nation as this?<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Jer. V. 29.</NOTE></Q> It is equivalent to a po&s;itive denunciation of the divine vengeance again&s;t that &s;inful people: and even more expre&s;&s;ive, than if it had been &s;aid directly&mdash;I will vi|&s;it
<PB N="7" REF="008665_0005_102FAB2C7839F778">
for the&s;e things: My &s;oul &s;hall be avenged on &s;uch a nation as this. This would have been com|paratively a cold, unanimated way of &s;peaking; far le&s;s adapted to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the reader or hearer, than the other.</P>
<P>THE manner of expre&s;&s;ion in the text, is obviou&s;ly the &s;ame with that, in the pa&s;&s;ages quoted above; be|ing more forcible than a &s;imple affirmation would have been, without &s;ome note of a&s;&s;everation proceeding. It is as if it had been &s;aid, Verily, or, &s;urely, there is no evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to prevent a dangerous error here, it mu&s;t be particularly remember'd, that by "evil" in the text, is not meant moral evil, or &s;in; but only natural, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> pain, affliction and calamity. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the prophet intended to attribute any other evil to God, as the author of it, be&s;ides the lat|ter. <Q>Far be it from God, that he &s;hould do wick|edly; and from the Almighty, that he &s;hould per|vert judgment!</Q> Nor can the &s;inful and evil actions of men, properly be attributed to him; or to any over-ruling providence of his, con&s;idered as their im|pul&s;ive cau&s;e, or as making them become nece&s;&s;ary. <Q>Let no man &s;ay [therefore] when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lu&s;t, and enticed. Then when lu&s;t hath conceived, it bringeth forth &s;in.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James 1. 13&punc; 14, 15.</NOTE></Q> This is the account which the apo&s;tle gives of the origin of &s;in, or moral evil: beyond which, if we pretend to go, in the way of &s;pe|culation and refinement; we &s;hall probably, at be&s;t, only amu&s;e our&s;elves, and perhaps not be innocent. If God is not properly &s;aid, even to "tempt" men
<PB N="8" REF="008665_0006_102FAB2E036E72D0">
to do evil; much le&s;s can it be truly &s;aid, that he compels them to do it, by any &s;ecret energy, or ope|ration, of his. We are doubtle&s;s, therefore, to under|&s;tand the prophet as &s;peaking here, only of natural evil, in contradi&s;tinction from moral: So that it will amount to this, that God is the author of all tho&s;e calamities and &s;ufferings, which at any time befal a city, or community. They are not to be looked on as the effects of chance, or accident; which are but empty names; but as proceeding ultimately from him, the &s;upreme governor of the world; and this, even tho' they are more immediately and vi&s;ibly ow|ing to the folly, or vice and wickedne&s;s, of men.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, in this &s;en&s;e, that there is no evil in a city, which the Lord hath not done, is indeed no more, in effect, than to a&s;&s;ert the univer&s;al government and providence of God; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, we all believe, whatever difficulties may attend our &s;peculations on the &s;ubject. If God is the &s;upreme ruler of the world, and exerci&s;eth &s;uch a univer&s;al government over it, as the &s;criptures every where &s;uppo&s;e and teach, and as nothing but folly or impiety can deny; he mu&s;t, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, either mediately or immediately, be the author of whatever events come to pa&s;s in it. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that there are any evils, or calamities, whether public or private, in the production whereof he has no concern, and which he did not de&s;ign, with|out a partial denial of his dominion and providence. For if any events come to pa&s;s, contrary to, or be&s;ide his de&s;ign, or without, and independently of him; his dominion is not an univer&s;al dominion, nor does his kingdom rule over all, as the &s;criptures a&s;&s;ert. The&s;e events, if any &s;uch there are, are plainly exceptions to the univer&s;ality of his government; being, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition it&s;elf, &s;uch as were neither done, nor
<PB N="9" REF="008665_0007_102FAB30CE9DED98">
ordered by him. But &s;urely no man but an athie&s;t, or at lea&s;t one who di&s;believes the holy &s;criptures, can think there are really any &s;uch events. It is not le&s;s a dictate of rea&s;on, than it is a doctrine of &s;cripture, that as all things have one common Creator, they are all &s;ubject to one common Lord, and under one &s;u|preme admini&s;tration; &s;o that nothing does, or can come to pa&s;s, but in conformity to his will, either po&s;i|tive or permi&s;&s;ive. The denial of which mu&s;t termi|nate, not merely in the denial of a univer&s;al &s;uper|intending providence, but of one or other of God's attributes; either his omni&s;cience, or his omnipotence, if not of both.</P>
<P>SOME public calamities are indeed, as was intimated above, more immediately and vi&s;ibly the Lord's do|ings than others. He is, however, to be acknowledg|ed as the author of them all in general; not excepting tho&s;e which are brought upon us by the in&s;trumen|tality of &s;ubordinate agents. The&s;e are all &s;ubject to his dominion and controul, and dependent upon him in their various operations; at lea&s;t &s;o far that they can do us no harm, but by his will and con&s;ent.</P>
<P>IT may be thought indeed by &s;ome, that God is more properly &s;aid only to permit, than to be him&s;elf the author of tho&s;e evils, whether public or private, which are brought upon us immediately by inferior agents; or thro' the wicked devices and practices of men. It is not worth while to di&s;pute this point, which is rather a que&s;tion of words and names, than of things. For it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that when the word permi&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed in this ca&s;e, it implies in it a will and de&s;ign, that the things permitted &s;hould ac|tually come to pa&s;s. When God is &s;aid to permit any thing, the meaning hereof is not merely this, that
<PB N="10" REF="008665_0008_102FAB336F7B55A0">
he does not prevent it; for in this &s;en&s;e, we al&s;o might be &s;aid to permit whatever happens throughout the univer&s;e, tho' it were not in our power to prevent it: The impropriety of which way of &s;peaking, would be obvious to all. When we &s;peak of God's permitting things, we mean that he does &s;o, knowingly and voluntarily, having at the &s;ame time power to prevent them, if he plea&s;ed. He might doubtle&s;s, if he plea&s;ed, prevent them by an immedate interpo&s;i|tion; or he might have originally predi&s;po&s;ed and or|dered things otherwi&s;e, and in &s;uch a manner, that the&s;e particular events &s;hould never have come to pa&s;s. For which rea&s;on, God's permitting them, &s;eems to amount to a po&s;itive will, or determination, that they &s;hould come to pa&s;s; or at lea&s;t, not to differ very materially herefrom.</P>
<P>BUT not to enter into any niceties upon a &s;ubject, &s;o intricate in its nature; I &s;hall content my &s;elf with ob&s;erving here, that, in the language of &s;cripture, God is not &s;aid to permit, but to do, tho&s;e things in general, which come to pa&s;s under his government, evil as well as good. <Q>I am the Lord, &s;aith he, and there is none el&s;e: I form the light, and create darkne&s;s: I make peace, and create evil; I the Lord do all the&s;e things.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. XLV. 6. 7.</NOTE></Q> The &s;criptures do not &s;peak of God as an unconcerned, or inactive &s;pectator, of any events; but as the author of them; and particularly the author of all the calamities which befal mankind. Only we are to take heed, that we do not &s;o conceive of his over-ruling providence, as to make him the author, or approver, of mens &s;inful actions. We are to a&s;cribe to him the mo&s;t univer&s;al dominion and agency, con&s;i&s;tent with this nece&s;&s;ary caution, or limitation. I &s;ay, con&s;i&s;tent with this; le&s;t we &s;hould be chargeable with bla&s;pheming God, un|der
<PB N="11" REF="008665_0009_102FAB3650675740">
the &s;hew and appearance of doing honor to him. And &s;ome there are, who could not perhaps ea&s;ily acquit them&s;elves of this charge, in re&s;pect of the man|ner in which they expre&s;s them&s;elves on the &s;ubject of God's providence and decrees.</P>
<P>BUT to wave every thing of a controver&s;ial nature, for which this is not, to be &s;ure, a proper occa&s;ion; let me here ju&s;t mention a few of tho&s;e many pub|lic calamities, which God brings upon mankind from age to age. For the ways are numerous, in which he manife&s;ts his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t &s;inful nations; and many the evils which he brings on wicked cities and communities, from one gene|ration to another. He &s;itteth upon the circuit of the earth; and all nations are before him le&s;s than nothing and vanity. All things are &s;ubject to his controul; and he makes u&s;e of them in various ways, to accompli&s;h the de&s;igns of his providence. Fire and hail, &s;now and vapour, and &s;tormy winds, fulfil his plea&s;ure: and the &s;tars in their cour&s;es, at his command, fight again&s;t his enemies.</P>
<P>GOD &s;ometimes lays cities de&s;olate by the &s;word of their enemies. Numberle&s;s in&s;tances hereof are particularly recorded in &s;acred &s;tory. And this is one of the ways, in which God has often threatned to cha&s;tize a wicked and rebellious people. This threatning was executed in a mo&s;t terrible manner, even on his cho&s;en people I&s;rael, after thay had filled up the mea&s;ure of their iniquities: when Jeru|&s;alem was turned into an heap of ruins by the Ro|mans, whom he armed and &s;ent again&s;t it.</P>
<P>AT other times God manife&s;ts his righteous di&s;|plea&s;ure again&s;t wicked cities and countries, by fa|mine.
<PB N="12" REF="008665_0010_102FAB39026F4A80">
Thus he reminds his people I&s;rael, for their warning, of what he had formerly done again&s;t them in this way; and reproves them for their &s;tubborn|ne&s;s under his afflicting hand. <Q>I have given you cleanne&s;s of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread&mdash;I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harve&s;t: And I cau&s;ed it to rain on one city, and cau&s;ed it not to rain on another city&mdash;I have &s;mitten you with bla&s;ting and mildew. When your gardens and vineyards, and your fig-trees, and olive-trees in|crea&s;ed, the palmer-worm devoured them: yet ye have not retarded unto me, &s;aith the Lord<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Amos Chap. IV.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THE pe&s;tilence is another of tho&s;e terrible judg|ments, by which God &s;ometimes lays cities and coun|tries de&s;olate. The I&s;raelites were often puni&s;hed for their &s;ins in this way, as they had been before threatned. <Q>I have &s;ent among&s;t you the pe&s;ti|lence, &s;aith God to them, after the manner of Egypt&mdash;and have made the slink of your camps to come up unto your no&s;trils: yet have ye not returned unto me.</Q></P>
<P>MANY cities have been de&s;troyed by terrible earth|quakes; &s;ome intirely; and others &s;o far, as to be la&s;ting monuments of God's righteous di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>OMITTING innumerable other calamities and judg|ments, by which God makes known his wrath again&s;t wicked cities; I &s;hall here only &s;ubjoin that of de&s;o|lating fire. Thus God threatned the king of Baby|lon of old&punc; <Q>Behold, I am again&s;t thee, O thou mo&s;t proud, &s;aith the Lord God of ho&s;ts: for thy day is come, and the time that I will vi&s;it the&mdash;And I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it

&s;hall devour round about him.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. L. 31, 32.</NOTE></Q> How many cities have been thus laid in ruins? &s;ome by fire from heaven, or mighty tempe&s;ts of thunder and lighting, as Sodom and Gomorrha: Of which cities it is &s;aid, that they are "&s;et forth for an example, "&s;uffering the vengeance of eternal fire; called eternal, becau&s;e tho&s;e cities were never rebuilded, but remained to all generations the monuments of God's wrath. But tho&s;e fires by which God de&s;troys, or &s;orely cha&s;tizes, proud and wicked cities, are not always thus kindled from heaven, as it were imme|diately by the breath of God. They are more fre|quently lighted up by other means; either by treach|erous inte&s;tine enemies with de&s;ign, or accidentally by other per&s;ons. But by whatever means it comes to pa&s;s, it is not done but by the will and appoint|ment of God, who over-rules all the&s;e events, and has, doubtle&s;s, important ends to accompli&s;h by them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>ONE of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t terrible fires known, was that of LONDON in the reign of Charles II. A. D. 1666. Of which the reader may plea&s;e to take the following account, extracted from Dr. Smollett's Compleat Hi&s;tory of England.</P>
<P>"ABOUT this period, &s;ays he, London was expo&s;ed to a ter|rible di&s;a&s;ter from a conflagration which broke out on the third day of September, in the hou&s;e of a baker. The flames, aug|mented by a &s;trongly ea&s;terly wind, raged with &s;urpri&s;ing vio|lence. They de&s;troyed &s;ix hundred &s;treets, including eighty-nine churches, many ho&s;pitals and public edifices, and thirteen thou&s;and two hundred private hou&s;es. The ruins comprehen|ded four hundred and thirty-&s;ix acres of ground. The con|flagration continued three days, notwith&s;tanding all the endea|vours that could be u&s;ed to &s;top its progre&s;s, the king and duke a&s;&s;i&s;ting per&s;onally on hor&s;e-back, from the fir&s;t alarm to its total ce&s;&s;ation. At length, when all hope had vani&s;hed, and the wretched inhabitants were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation and de&s;pair, it &s;uddenly cea&s;ed, and was intirely extingui&s;hed&punc; after having reduced many thou&s;and families from affluence to mi&s;ery, and the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city in Europe to a deplorable heap of rubbi&s;h. Neverthele&s;s the &s;pirit of the people did not &s;ink under this calamity. London &s;oon ro&s;e more beautiful from its a&s;hes. The king&mdash;regulated the plans of the new &s;treets, &s;o as to render them more &s;pacious and convenient than tho&s;e which had been burned. And he pro|hibited the u&s;e of lath and timber, as materials for the con|&s;truction of the hou&s;es. The narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets had not only &s;ubjected them to ca&s;ualties of this nature, but al&s;o prevented a free circulation of air, which being impregnated with animal vapors, was apt to putrify, and produce infectious di&s;tempers, in&s;omuch that London was &s;carce ever free from a contagion; whereas no &s;uch di&s;temper has appeared &s;ince the city was rebuilt."</P></NOTE></P>

ALAS! We need not go to di&s;tant countries for examples of calamities of this kind. This capital of the province has &s;everal times &s;uffered &s;everely by means of fire: Particularly about fifty years ago, when a con&s;iderable part of the town was reduced to ruins<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Upwards of an hundred buildings were then con&s;umed.</NOTE> Since which there have been divers de|&s;tructive fires in the town, tho' all of them far le&s;s exten&s;ive and ruinous.

Some per&s;ons of ea&s;y, comfortable fortunes, are brought at once into a &s;tate of depen|dence but little better than that of beggary: Some, of large and affluent ones, have lo&s;t the greater part of what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: Whil&s;t others of the poorer &s;ort have lo&s;t all; and are, for the pre&s;ent, deprived of all means of getting a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; &s;o that they mu&s;t either peri&s;h, or become a public charge.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="008665_0013_102FAB3FD9BD85F8">
SOME circum&s;tances preceeding and attending this great di&s;a&s;ter, are not unworthy of our particular no|tice. Fires have been more frequent in the town of late, than perhaps they have ever been in times pa&s;t. It is but three or four months &s;ince a con&s;iderable fire happened, whereby many per&s;ons were great &s;ufferers.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At Oliver's dock; about 12 or 15 families being then burnt out.</NOTE> A few weeks after this, another fire broke out; by which, tho' not &s;o many dwelling-hou&s;es were con|&s;umed, yet perhaps as much damage was &s;u&s;tained.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the we&s;terly part of the town; when two rope-walks, with their apparatus, were de&s;troyed; and other effects to the value of &s;ome thou&s;ands of pounds.</NOTE> And for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively before this la&s;t, and mo&s;t terrible conflagration happened, the town was alarmed by fire. The fir&s;t of the&s;e fires broke out at a very &s;mall di&s;tance from this place;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">On Monday, March 17th.</NOTE> it got to a great head, and threatned to lay wa&s;te this part of the town, together with this hou&s;e of prayer, the hou&s;e of God, wherein we are now a&s;&s;embled; on which the fire had actually taken hold. But, thro' the good providence of God, this very dangerous flame was happily extingui&s;hed, without the intire con&s;umption of any one dwelling-hou&s;e: and we are again permitted, contrary to the expectation of many, to a&s;&s;emble our&s;elves for the wor|&s;hip of God, as u&s;ual, in this place. So that we have, in this re&s;pect, cau&s;e to &s;ing of mercy, while, in others, we &s;ing of judgment.</P>
<P>THE alarm on the next day, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on tue&s;day, was very great, and not without &s;ufficient rea&s;on: When, by &s;ome means, the Laboratory of the royal train of artillery here took fire, and was blown up; when the adjoin|ing buildings took the fire al&s;o, which was in imminent danger of being communicated to the king's &s;tores, in
<PB N="16" REF="008665_0014_102FAB426D19EDD0">
which, it is &s;aid, a large quantity of powder, charged &s;hells, &amp;c. were repo&s;ited. The apprehen&s;ion of the fire's making its way to the&s;e &s;tores, and of the fatal con&s;equences that might thence en&s;ue, put the town into a general con&s;ternation. It was &s;ome time before people thought it prudent, or advi&s;eable, to approach the fire, &s;o as to u&s;e any methods to extingui&s;h it. But on further information, and a more exact knowledge of the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of things, they ap|plied them&s;elves to the bu&s;ine&s;s with great alertne&s;s and re&s;olution. And thus this fire was extingui&s;hed, when it had done only a &s;mall part of the damage that was apprehended from it; tho' in it&s;elf that was not in|con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>THE day following,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wedne&s;day the 19th.</NOTE> different parts of the town, at different times, were alarmed with the cry of fire. It did not, however, then get to a con&s;iderable head any where, &s;o as to become dangerous: Only as there is always &s;ome danger from a fire, tho' but &s;mall, in &s;uch a town as this; e&s;pecially in &s;uch a dry and windy time as it was then.</P>

When this fire broke out, and for &s;ome time before, it was almo&s;t calm. And had it continued &s;o, the fire might probably have been ex|tingui&s;hed in a &s;hort time, before it had done much

damage; con&s;idering the remarkable re&s;olution and dexterity of many people among&s;t us on &s;uch occa&s;ions. But it &s;eems that God, who had &s;pared us before be|yond our hopes, was now determined to let loo&s;e his wrath upon us; to <Q>rebuke us in his anger, and cha&s;ten us in his hot di&s;plea&s;ure.</Q> In order to the accompli&s;hing of which de&s;ign, &s;oon after the fire broke out, he cau&s;ed his wind to blow; and &s;uddenly rai&s;ed it to &s;uch an height, that all endeavours to put a &s;top to the raging flames, were ineffectual: Tho' there &s;eems to have been no want, either of any pains or prudence, which could be expected at &s;uch a time. The Lord had purpo&s;ed, and who &s;hould di&s;annul it? His hand was &s;tretched out, and who &s;hould turn it back.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai.

The hou&s;es, and other things, were as fuel prepared for the fire to feed on: And the flames were &s;uddenly &s;pread, and propagated to di&s;tant places. So that, in the &s;pace of a few hours, the fire &s;wept all before it in the direction of the wind; &s;preading wider and wi|der from the place where it began, till it reached the water. Nor did it &s;top even there, without the de|&s;truction of the wharfs, with &s;everal ve&s;&s;els lying at them, and the imminent danger of many others.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">One large &s;hip, and eight or nine other ve&s;&s;els were burnt: One of which was loaded, or partly loaded, with the king's ordnance-&s;tores, ready to &s;ail.

And when I add, God grant that the like may never be beheld again, I am &s;ure you will all &s;ay, <HI>Amen!</HI></P>
<P>IN &s;hort, this mu&s;t needs be con&s;idered, not only as a very great, but public calamity. It will be many years before this town, long burthened with &s;o great, not to &s;ay, di&s;proportionate, a &s;hare of the public expences, will recover it&s;elf from the terrible blow. Nor will this metropolis only be affected and prejudi|ced hereby. The whole province will feel it. For &s;uch are the dependencies and connexions in civil &s;ociety, regularly con&s;tituted, that one part of a com|munity cannot be much hurt, without detriment to the re&s;t: As in the human body, if one member &s;uffer, all the other members &s;uffer with it. E&s;pe|cially, if the HEAD be &s;ick, or maimed, the whole body will &s;oon feel the effects hereof, and partake of its &s;ufferings. And whatever &s;ome weak, or envious per&s;ons may imagine, the good of the province in general, is very clo&s;ely connected with the welfare, and flouri&s;hing condition of this CAPITAL: So that if it &s;hould fall into decay and ruin, the mo&s;t remote parts of the country would very &s;oon feel the bad effects of it.</P>
<P>AT whatever time this di&s;a&s;ter had befallen us, it would have been a very great one: But it is particularly &s;o at pre&s;ent, when both the town and country are &s;o much exhau&s;ted by public taxes, e&s;pecially the former: When we have &s;uch a load of debt lying upon us; a load &s;till increa&s;ing, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening; and when
<PB N="19" REF="008665_0017_102FAB48A196E468">
the &s;ea&s;on of the year is ju&s;t coming on, for pro&s;ecu|ting our military de&s;igns and operations. This cala|mity could not well have befallen us at any time, or conjuncture, wherein we &s;hould have been le&s;s able to bear up under it, and &s;urmount the difficulties oc|ca&s;ioned by it. But without any reference to the&s;e peculiar circum&s;tances, which enhance the misfortune, the lo&s;s or damage, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is &s;o great&punc; that it cannot be exactly computed in &s;o &s;hort a time as that &s;ince the calamity befell us.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">In a vote which pa&s;&s;ed the Great and General Court on the &s;aturday after the late fire, it is &s;aid to <Q>appear on the be&s;t information that could in &s;o &s;hort a time be obtained, that there were con&s;umed one hundred &s;eventy-four dwelling-hou&s;es and tenements, and one hundred &s;eventy-five warehou&s;es, &s;hops and other buildings, with a great part of the furniture, be&s;ides large quantities of merchan|dize, and the &s;tock and tools of many trade&s;men; that the lo&s;s, upon a moderate computation, cannot be le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; and&mdash;that the number of families inhabiting the aforementioned hou&s;es, was at lea&s;t two hundred and twenty; three quarters of whom are by this misfortune rendered inca|pable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them&s;elves, and a great number of them reduced to extreme poverty, and require immediate relief.</Q> For which charitable purpo&s;e three thou&s;and pounds currency, being about two thou&s;and two hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling, was voted to be drawn out of the public trea&s;ury; and his Excellency the Governor de&s;ired to &s;end briefs throughout the province, recommending a gene|ral contribution for the unhappy &s;ufferers.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT highly concerns us rightly to improve this vi&s;iti|tation of providence, and to conduct our&s;elves pro|perly under it. This will be, not only our wi&s;dom, but our greate&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t public calamities and di&s;a&s;ters for the future, whether of this, or any other kind.

Now, this being truly a public, as well as great ca|lamity, I &s;hall, in the FIRST place, make &s;ome re|flexions upon it, which concern us all in common&punc; SECONDLY, I &s;hall direct my di&s;cour&s;e particularly to tho&s;e among&s;t us, who have been more immediate &s;ufferers therein. And THIRDLY, To tho&s;e, who&s;e dwellings and &s;ub&s;tance have been pre&s;erved; and who are not directly involved in this calamity.</P>
<P>FIRST, IT becomes us all in general, &s;eriou&s;ly to regard the hand and providence of God in this evil that has befallen us. This evil, this great evil, has not &s;urely come upon us, but by his appointment, and according to his &s;overeign plea&s;ure. Various conjec|tures have been made, and rumours &s;pread abroad, concerning the particular means, by which this raging and de&s;tructive fire was fir&s;t kindled up. Which of them is right, or whether either of them be &s;o or not, I am not able to tell: Nor is this very material to my pre&s;ent de&s;ign. By whatever means this calami|tous event has come to pa&s;s, we are to look &s;till higher; to the great Author and di&s;po&s;er of all things: For the Lord him&s;elf hath done it. We ought ulti|mately to regard him therein, if there be any &s;uch thing as a providence &s;uperintending human affairs. <Q>Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh in vain: It is vain for us to ri&s;e up early, or &s;it up late, to eat the bread of &s;orrows.</Q> And the fir&s;t thing requi&s;ite, in order to a due improve|ment of this vi&s;itation, is a fixed, firm per&s;wa&s;ion, that God's hand and coun&s;el determined it to be done; or that it is really a vi&s;itation from him. We cannot proceed a &s;tep, in the way of religious reflexion upon it, unle&s;s we lay this down fir&s;t as a certain principle.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="008665_0019_102FAB4F1F710E98">
WE ought, in the next place, to acknowledge the ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, in bringing this &s;ore calamity upon us: For the Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. Ju&s;tice and judgment are the habitation of his throne, not only when the light of his countenance is lifted up, and &s;hines upon us in our pro&s;perity; but al&s;o when clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him, and we are overwhelmed with adver&s;ity. God does not af|flict willingly, or grieve the children of men, even when they have incurred his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure: Much le&s;s does he wantonly puni&s;h the innocent. We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, it is not without ju&s;t and &s;ufficient provocation, that he has appeared thus again&s;t us. It becomes us therefore to be humble and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive under his cha&s;tening hand; under this great frown of his providence. For <Q>wherefore &s;hould a living man complain, a man for the puni&s;hment of his &s;ins!</Q></P>
<P>THIS is a &s;ea&s;on, wherein it doubtle&s;s becomes us all &s;eriou&s;ly to examine our ways, in order to di&s;cover, as far as may be, what are the &s;pecial grounds and rea&s;ons of God's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t us, and of his con|tending with us in &s;o terrible a manner&punc; Indeed this general con&s;ideration, that we are &s;inful creatures in common with the re&s;t of mankind, were plainly &s;uffi|cient to ju&s;tify God's dealings with us, even tho' this calamity had been far greater than it is. However, the holy &s;criptures give us rea&s;on to think, that God &s;eldom, or never, brings very great and public cala|mities upon a community, unle&s;s it is for &s;ins of a very heinous and provoking nature. In which re|&s;pect, there &s;eems to be a wide and material difference between the conduct of providence towards nations, or communities, and towards particular per&s;ons. For
<PB N="22" REF="008665_0020_102FAB51EC428548">
with regard to the latter, this certainly will not hold true; the be&s;t men being often the greate&s;t &s;ufferers in this world. <Q>All things come alike to all; and there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked,</Q> if we &s;peak with reference to individu|als, in this pre&s;ent &s;tate: So that <Q>no man knoweth either love or hatred from all that is before him;</Q> either by the pro&s;perity he enjoys, or the adver&s;ity which he &s;uffers. Which &s;eems not applicable to communities; at lea&s;t, not ea&s;ily reconcileable with the &s;cripture account of God's conduct towards them, to &s;ay nothing of what we are taught by experience.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not to penetrate &s;o far into the views and de&s;igns of providence, as to be able particularly and po&s;itively to determine, for what rea&s;ons it is that God has thus &s;orely cha&s;tized us. "His judgments are a great deep." We may, however, conclude in general, that whatever &s;ins are mo&s;t prevalent among&s;t us, the&s;e are &s;ins which have contributed mo&s;t to bring this great calamity upon us. In going thus far, there is no pre&s;umption. No particular &s;ins, or &s;inners, are indeed to be excluded, as not contributing to bring calamities upon a people, whenever God &s;ends them. However, I &s;uppo&s;e we are to look for the primary, or chief cau&s;es of common calamities, not in a compara|tively &s;mall number of particular per&s;ons, however im|pious or profligate; but in the main body of a people. Common judgments mu&s;t ordinarily be &s;uppo&s;ed to to have &s;ome common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>AND are there not &s;ome &s;ins, with which we are very generally chargeable? If any one &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that we were generally profane &s;wearers, whoremon|gers, drunkards, adulterers, thieves or liars, he would doubtle&s;s him&s;elf de&s;erve no better a character than
<PB N="23" REF="008665_0021_102FAB5373FDEBD8">
that of a fal&s;e accu&s;er, and &s;hamele&s;s calumniator. There, are indeed, many &s;uch &s;inners among&s;t us; but it is to be hoped their number is &s;mall&punc; in com|pari&s;on of tho&s;e who are guiltle&s;s of any of the&s;e crimes. But &s;uppo&s;e any one &s;hould &s;ay, that pride was a &s;in very generally prevalent among&s;t us, would he merit the character of a fal&s;e accu&s;er? If another were to a&s;&s;ert, that we were generally addicted to luxury, would he be a calumniator? If a third were to tax us with being generally &s;elfi&s;h, and greedy of gain, without a due and proportionate regard to the welfare of the public, or of our neighbour; could we truly deny the charge? If a fourth were to ac|cu&s;e us of formality in our religion, of laying too great &s;tre&s;s on &s;ome things of little or no importance, and comparatively neglecting the weightier matters of the law and go&s;pel, could we ju&s;tly deny this to be our character? I do not my&s;elf bring the&s;e general accu&s;ations; but it would not be ami&s;s for us &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, how far they might be ju&s;t. If there be a real and &s;ufficient foundation for them, we need not be at any lo&s;s for &s;uch cau&s;es of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, as are common to us.</P>
<P>NOR would it be improper for us, on this occa&s;ion, to inquire, whether we have been duly thankful to God for the &s;ignal mercies and deliverances which he hath vouch&s;afed to us in times pa&s;t. He has &s;hown great favour and kindne&s;s to us at &s;undry times&punc; and in divers manners. Tho' he has often contend|ed with us by fire heretofore; yet how often have very threatning fires been &s;ea&s;onably extingui&s;hed; and not permitted to prevail again&s;t us. Have we generally been thankful, properly thankful, for the&s;e favourable appearances of providence for us, in the times of danger and fear? If not, our ingratitude in
<PB N="24" REF="008665_0022_102FAB5609BD1678">
this re&s;pect, may be &s;uppo&s;ed one &s;pecial rea&s;on of the late terrible calamity. God's de&s;ign may be, to make us more &s;en&s;ible of former mercies, by the greatne&s;s of the evil he has now brought upon us.</P>
<P>GOD has repeatedly vi&s;ited us with earthquakes, the mo&s;t alarming in their nature of any of his pro|vidential di&s;pen&s;ations. However his goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion have &s;till &s;pared us in the&s;e times of our di&s;tre&s;s, when we had rea&s;on to apprehend the mo&s;t awful and fatal effects of the&s;e vi&s;itations; par|ticularly of one of them, a few years &s;ince: Tho' about the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t amazing de&s;olations were wrought by earthquakes in &s;ome other parts of the world. Have we taken proper notice of his dealings with us in this re&s;pect? If not, this may be another rea&s;on of the great calamity now brought upon us.</P>
<P>MOREOVER: Our enemies, during the late and pre&s;ent war, have been forming dangerous de&s;igns again&s;t us, even again&s;t this metropolis. But God has repeatedly bla&s;ted their de&s;igns; and has lately given us the mo&s;t remarkable &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t them: So that our once ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions from them, are vani&s;hed away; and even turned into triumph over them. Have we been duly thankful for the&s;e de|liverances and mercies? If not, this may be one cau&s;e, why he has now de&s;troyed by fire, what he would not permit the enemy to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>PERHAPS we have rejoiced with an unchri&s;tian, and inhuman joy, in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities lately brought upon our enemies; when great part of their country was ravaged, their villages burnt, their ca|pital city be&s;ieged, and partly con&s;umed by fire.
<PB N="25" REF="008665_0023_102FAB59BAF239A8">
If we have rejoiced in their mi&s;ery with an unrelenting&punc; &s;avage temper of mind, God may have been hereby provoked to bring this great evil upon us; which, in its kind, bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to what they have &s;uffered. Or if we have not rejoiced in the mi&s;ery of our enemies with an unchri&s;tian, barbarous joy, perhaps we have triumphed over them with unchri&s;ti|an pride; and been vainly elated with the &s;ucce&s;&s;es God has given us, in&s;tead of being humbly thank|ful to him therefor. And if this be the ca&s;e, God doubtle&s;s de&s;igned to check our pride by this vi&s;ita|tion, and make us think more &s;oberly of our&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT if there are no particular &s;ins, with which we are chargeable in common; yet are we not all in general chargeable with &s;ome? &s;ome of us with one vice, or mi&s;demeanour, and &s;ome with another? If &s;o, this is a &s;ufficient ground for our being thus cha&s;tized by a common calamity. And we were doubtle&s;s ripe for &s;ome &s;ignal puni&s;hment from the hand of providence, when this great evil came upon us. Many atrocious &s;ins, and flagrant abominations, are found in the mid&s;t of us. To what an amazing pitch of wickedne&s;s and impudence, &s;ome per&s;ons among&s;t us were arrived, is evident even from &s;ome tran&s;actions at the time of the late terrible fire. For, in&s;tead of being affected with &s;o melancholly a pro|vidence, and charitably a&s;&s;i&s;ting people in &s;aving their effects, &s;ome there were, &s;o hardened and &s;hamele&s;s, as to take the opportunity of the general confu&s;ion&punc; to &s;teal and rifle their neighbours goods! One would hardly have thought it po&s;&s;ible for people to be &s;o wicked, impious and abandon'd. I hope, indeed, there were not many &s;uch; and that the&s;e were not born and educated among&s;t us, tho' I am not certain. But wherever they were born and bred, they are
<PB N="26" REF="008665_0024_102FAB5C8ED50EE0">
certainly a di&s;grace, not only to their own country, but to the world it&s;elf, and to human nature.</P>
<P>IT does not become us, even the be&s;t of us, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, to ju&s;tify&punc; or excu&s;e our|&s;elves; or to attribute this public calamity wholly to the &s;ins of others. Probably none of us can in|tirely acquit our&s;elves of having contributed to it, by our own particular mi&s;carriages. And it highly concerns us all, &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect upon our pa&s;t conduct; and to humble our&s;elves under the righteous hand of God.</P>
<P>WE may all learn &s;ome very u&s;eful and important le&s;&s;ons from this vi&s;itation, if we duly attend to it. We are hereby more particularly reminded of the vanity of worldly riches&punc; and the folly of depending on, or placing our chief happine&s;s in them. How &s;uddenly do they take to them&s;elves wings, and fly away, as an eagle towards heaven, leaving the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of them de&s;titute, not only of &s;uperfluous wealth, but even of tho&s;e things which are needful for the body! This is one of tho&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, which give a particular force and energy to tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle&mdash;<Q>Charge them that are rich, that they tru&s;t not in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy:</Q> And al&s;o to that more general admonition of our Saviour him&s;elf&mdash;<Q>Lay not up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures upon earth, where moth and ru&s;t do corrupt, and where thieves break thro' and &s;teal; but lay up for your&s;elves trea&s;ure in heaven,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h the&s;e general reflections: We are all in common admoni&s;hed by this vi&s;itation of providence,
<PB N="27" REF="008665_0025_102FAB5E156EC548">
to con&s;ider and amend our ways. Doubtle&s;s the end of our being thus vi&s;ited and cha&s;tized, is our refor|mation. Whatever &s;erious reflections we may at pre&s;ent make upon this calamitous event; yet the great de&s;ign of it will not be an&s;wered upon us, if we continue unreformed. This is often the ca&s;e. Pharaoh and his people were in &s;ome mea&s;ure hum|bled, at the time when the plagues were upon them. But they &s;oon forgat the judgments of heaven; and became more hardened afterwards. This was &s;ome|times the ca&s;e al&s;o with the people of I&s;rael. <Q>Thou ha&s;t &s;tricken them, &s;ays the prophet, but they have not grieved; thou ha&s;t con&s;umed them, but they have refu&s;ed to receive correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refu&s;ed to return.</Q> If we are not reclaimed from our &s;ins and vices by this calamity, we have rea&s;on to apprehend greater and heavier ones: God's anger will not be turned away; but his hand will &s;till be &s;tretched out again&s;t us. O let us not, by our impenitence and hardne&s;s of heart under this correction&punc; provoke God to &s;mite us with greater &s;everity; le&s;t, perhaps, we peri&s;h under his hand, while there is none to deliver! But, on the other hand, if we duly lay to heart this &s;ore cha&s;ti&s;ement, and return to God, he will doubtle&s;s return to us in mercy. <Q>Come then, and let us return unto the Lord: For he hath torn, and he will heal us&punc; he hath &s;mitten, and he will bind us up.</Q> Tho' he hath vi&s;ited our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with a rod, and our iniquities with &s;tripes; yet his loving kindne&s;s will he not utterly take from us; nor &s;uffer his faith|fulne&s;s to fail.</P>
<P>BUT I was in the next place,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, To direct my di&s;cour&s;e particularly
<PB N="28" REF="008665_0026_102FAB60A9395840">
to tho&s;e among&s;t us, who have been the more im|mediate &s;ufferers in this common calamity. My brethren, I tru&s;t we all in general heartily &s;ympa|thize with you, and bear a part in your affliction. But if it concerns us all in common, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the hand of God in this vi&s;itation, allow me to remind you, that it more e&s;pecially concerns you to do &s;o, on whom this great calamity, by his appointment, has more immediately fallen. To us, this providence more than whi&s;pers; to you it &s;peaks &s;till louder, even in thunder. I would, however, be very far from in&s;inuating, that the unhappy per&s;ons who are the immediate &s;ubjects of this calamity, are in general more guilty in the &s;ight of God than others. This would be at once uncharitable in it&s;elf, and a plain violation of a rule, or maxim, which our Saviour laid down on an occa&s;ion not altogether unlike to the pre&s;ent. But &s;till you mu&s;t acknowledge&punc; that altho' the call and admonition of providence in this vi&s;ita|tion, be to all of us in common; yet to you it is more direct and immediate, as well as louder. You are e&s;pecially admoni&s;hed to examine your ways, in this day of vi&s;itation and trial. And if you &s;hould di&s;regard this providence, you would doubtle&s;s be more inexcu&s;able than others.</P>
<P>IT becomes you to bear your lo&s;&s;es, however great, with patience, and humble re&s;ignation to the will of God: For he it is, you will remember, that has brought this evil upon you.

It were not ami&s;s for you on this occa&s;ion, to reflect on the much grea|ter lo&s;&s;es and &s;ufferings of Job; and on the manner in which he conducted him&s;elf under them. He <Q>fell down upon the ground, and wor&s;hipped, and &s;aid, Naked came I out of my mothers womb; and naked &s;hall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.

<P>God has doubtle&s;s wi&s;e and holy, and even gracious ends, to an&s;wer by vi&s;iting you in this manner. The vi&s;itation is particularly calculated to wean your affec|tions from this evil world; and excite you to &s;eek, with greater diligence, the true, &s;piritual riches. Per|haps your hearts have been heretofore too much &s;et upon the world; and tho&s;e riches which will not "profit in the day of wrath." If this be the ca&s;e, God hath &s;hown you your error by this vi&s;itation of his providence; and calls upon you hereby, for the future to &s;et your affections only on tho&s;e things that are above, where Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;itteth at his right hand. It will be happy for you, if you make &s;o rea&s;onable and wi&s;e improvement of your worldly lo&s;&s;es; they will then be the greate&s;t gain to you in the end. Any acce&s;&s;ion to, or increa&s;e of your virtues, is of far more benefit and importance to you, than thou|&s;ands of &s;ilver or of gold would be, or all worldly riches. The&s;e are corruptible and tran&s;itory: but that is a trea&s;ure that fadeth not away, incorruptible and eternal. And a good man, in the language of

the apo&s;tle, equally bold and beautiful, <Q>having nothing, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth all things!</Q></P>
<P>THOSE who&s;e habitations and wealth have been con&s;umed by this de&s;olating fire, have &s;till great cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s, that their lives have been pre|&s;erved. <Q>The life is more than meat, and the body than raiment.</Q> Con&s;idering the time when this fire broke out&punc; being the dead of the night, when people were in their beds, and &s;ome of them on beds of &s;ickne&s;s; con&s;idering the violence of the wind, and the rapidity with which the flames &s;pread, and catch'd from place to place; the wide extent of them, and the general confu&s;ion and con&s;ternation which they occa&s;ion'd; con&s;idering the&s;e things, I &s;ay, it would not have been &s;trange, if many per&s;ons had peri&s;hed together with their &s;ub&s;tance, and mixed their own a&s;hes with that of their dwellings. But no life was lo&s;t. In this re&s;pect, God remembered mer|cy in the mid&s;t of judgment; which demands our grateful acknowledgments; and particularly the thanks of tho&s;e, who were in danger of being con|&s;umed in their dwellings, as many of the unhappy &s;ufferers were.</P>
<P>BESIDES: I take it for granted, that few, or none of you, my brethren and u&s;ual hearers, have lo&s;t all your worldly &s;ub&s;tance, as &s;ome others are &s;aid to have done. Let me therefore exhort you to be thankful to God for what he has left you &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; e&s;pecially if that be &s;ufficient for you to &s;ub&s;i&s;t comfortably upon, in the way of hone&s;t indu&s;try. Tho' you ought not to de&s;pi&s;e the cha&s;tening of the Lord in the lo&s;&s;es you have &s;u&s;tained; yet it becomes you to acknowledge his goodne&s;s in what is left you. It is not a great deal that is nece&s;&s;ary to the ends of
<PB N="31" REF="008665_0029_102FAB68A0BBD648">
life: virtue, and moderate de&s;ires, are &s;atisfied with little; and having food and raiment, you ought to be therewith content. We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out of it, how much &s;oever we po&s;&s;e&s;s: Though if we could, it would be of no advantage to us. In heaven we &s;hould not need, but de&s;pi&s;e and neglect it; and in hell it would not alleviate our torments.</P>
<P>BUT if any of you &s;hould have lo&s;t all your worldly &s;ub&s;tance by this calamity, you ought not, however, to de&s;pond under this trial, or to faint, being thus rebuked of the Lord; but &s;till to place your hope and tru&s;t in him, who heareth the young ravens when they cry. <Q>O fear the Lord, ye his faints&punc; for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and &s;uffer hunger; but they that &s;eek the Lord &s;hall not want any good thing<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm XXXIV. 9, 10.</NOTE>.</Q> I reminded you above of the &s;ufferings and patience of Job&punc; let me now remind you of the "end of the Lord" with re&s;pect to him; <Q>that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James V. 11.</NOTE>.</Q> That good man &s;aw at length an happy i&s;&s;ue of his troubles.

And it is a circum&s;tance not unwor|thy to remind you of, for your con&s;olation&punc; that you live in a country&punc; at lea&s;t in a town, wherein there is a general di&s;po&s;ition in the people to afford nece&s;&s;ary relief to the poor and afflicted: So that you have no rea&s;on to be under any anxiety of mind re&s;pecting a livelihood; e&s;pecially if you enjoy bodily health and &s;trength, with ability to exerci&s;e &s;ome lawful calling. But whatever be your condition in this
<PB N="32" REF="008665_0030_102FAB6B332DE9D8">
world, godline&s;s with contentment will be, not only your duty, but your greate&s;t gain. You &s;hould en|deavour to be prepared for whatever circum&s;tances God &s;hall order for you; and to this end, be&s;eech him to give you the temper of the holy apo&s;tle, who &s;aid, <Q>I have learned in what&s;oever &s;tate I am, therewith to be content: I know both how to be aba&s;ed, and I know how to abound; every where, and in all things I am in&s;tructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to &s;uffer need<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. IV. 11, 12.</NOTE>.</Q> Even the Son of man had not where to lay his head, tho' the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts.&mdash;And if the &s;ame mind be in you, which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us&punc; you will bear the extreme&s;t poverty without repining. Le&s;t there|fore you &s;hould be weary or faint in your minds, con&s;ider him, who "tho' he were rich, yet for your &s;ake became poor": Learn of him to be truly "meek and lowly in heart; and whatever be your outward condition, you will then "find re&s;t unto your &s;ouls"; &s;uch re&s;t as the greate&s;t worldly pro&s;|perity cannot give!</P>
<P>THIRDLY: Let me now turn my di&s;cour&s;e to tho&s;e, who&s;e habitations and &s;ub&s;tance have been pre|&s;erved in this time of de&s;olation; e&s;pecially to tho&s;e, who have been in imminent danger of being &s;harers with others therein. As this calamity is from God, &s;o it is he who has directed it where to fall, and pre&s;cribed its bounds and limits. You &s;hould there|fore be &s;en&s;ible, that he has been your pre&s;erver; and made this di&s;tinction between you and others. If others ought to acknowledge his providence in the calamity which has befallen them, certainly it is not le&s;s incumbent on us to acknowledge it in our own
<PB N="33" REF="008665_0031_102F74E1843FAD50">
pre&s;ervation. Had God, who commandeth the wind when and where to blow, given a different direction to it&punc; our habitations might have been con&s;umed, while tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ufferers were pre&s;erved. I mention this circum&s;tance particularly, becau&s;e it is familiar and obvious; plainly &s;howing&punc; that it is God&punc; and not man, who has made this difference; an im|portant truth, which might be evinced by other con|&s;iderations al&s;o, were there time and occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>NOR ought we to attribute our pre&s;ervation to any &s;uppo&s;ed merit, or &s;uperior goodne&s;s in our&s;elves; or the &s;ufferings of our neighbours, to any greater guilt or demerit in them. Our Saviour &s;eems to have de|&s;igned a general caution again&s;t &s;uch imaginations, in a pa&s;&s;age which was alluded to above. When certain per&s;ons told him of &s;ome Galileans, who&s;e blood Pilate had mingled with their &s;acrifices, expecting&punc; probably&punc; that he would have attributed this to the great wicked|ne&s;s of tho&s;e Galileans in compari&s;on with others, his reply was&mdash;<Q>Suppo&s;e ye that the&s;e Galileans were &s;inners above all the Galileans, becau&s;e they &s;uffered &s;uch things? I tell you, Nay&mdash;Or tho&s;e eighteen, on whom the tower of Siloam fell&punc; and &s;lew them; think ye that they were &s;inners above all men that dwelt at Jeru&s;alem? I tell you, Nay: But except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</Q> Our Sa|viour's meaning here is not, that tho&s;e Galileans, and tho&s;e Jews, were not &s;inners; or that they did not ju&s;tly &s;uffer &s;uch things on account of their &s;ins. Neither of the&s;e things can be &s;uppo&s;ed. But the obvious de&s;ign of this remarkable pa&s;&s;age is, to teach us that God, in his providential government of the world, does not always &s;ingle out the greate&s;t &s;inners, to make them the greate&s;t &s;ufferers in the &s;ight of men; and, con&s;equently, that we ought not to con|clude
<PB N="34" REF="008665_0032_102FAB7176A82C18">
our&s;elves more righteous than others, merely becau&s;e we at pre&s;ent e&s;cape tho&s;e judgments which befal others. God will finally give to every man according to his deeds, in weight and mea&s;ure, and exact proportion. But at pre&s;ent he acts as a &s;ove|reign: I mean, in the outward di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence towards particular per&s;ons; agreeably to the ob&s;ervations of Solomon, mentioned in the for|mer part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, that "all things come alike to all; that there is one event to the righteous and the wicked; and that no man knoweth either love or hatred from all that is before him." A great|er than Solomon has confirmed the&s;e remarks on the conduct of divine providence. We &s;hould there|fore take heed, that we do not attribute to our own &s;uperior piety or virtue, what we ought to a&s;cribe &s;olely to the &s;overeign plea&s;ure of God, and his di&s;tingui&s;hing favour towards us. For to apply our Saviour's language and rea&s;oning above, to the me|lancholly occa&s;ion before us: Suppo&s;e ye that tho&s;e who have lately &s;uffered &s;uch things&punc; were &s;inners above all that dwell in BOSTON? I tell you, Nay! At lea&s;t&punc; we have no rea&s;on to think them &s;o&punc; on this account. Many who have e&s;caped this di&s;a&s;ter, and perhaps we our&s;elves, are as great, or greater &s;inners; and except we repent, &s;ome <Q>wor&s;e thing may come unto us.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT &s;hall we render unto the Lord for his di&s;|tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s to us in this re&s;pect? It becomes us to render prai&s;e to him; for "who&s;e offereth prai&s;e, &s;aith the Lord, glorifieth me." We &s;hould al&s;o &s;hew our gratitude to God, by devoting our&s;elves&punc; and all we have, to his honor and &s;ervice. His goodne&s;s and forbearance lead Us to repentance, while his righteous &s;everity is exerci&s;ed towards others for the &s;ame general
<PB N="35" REF="008665_0033_102FAB7348F59058">
end. Us he draweth with the cords of love, while he &s;courgeth others, not more guilty, with the rod of af|fliction. And &s;hall we de&s;pi&s;e his goodne&s;s, forbear|ance and long-&s;uffering! If there be any peculiar au|daciou&s;ne&s;s, or pre&s;umption, in de&s;pi&s;ing the cha&s;ten|ing of the Lord; there is certainly a peculiar ba&s;ene&s;s and di&s;ingenuity, in de&s;pi&s;ing his goodne&s;s. We and our &s;ub&s;tance, have been as it were plucked out of that fire, by which others have &s;uffered &s;o much. Let us therefore take heed, le&s;t we incur that heavy cen&s;ure, Amos Chap. IV. <Q>I have overthrown &s;ome of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha; and YE were as a fire-brand plucked out of the burning; yet have ye not returned unto me, &s;aith the Lord!</Q></P>
<P>WILL it not particularly become us to &s;hew our gratitude to God for his di&s;tingui&s;hing mercy to us&punc; by chearfully imparting of our &s;ub&s;tance for the relief of our indigent brethren? The government has alrea|dy done &s;omething for their pre&s;ent relief. But there being &s;o many of the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers, they will doubtle&s;s &s;tand in need of farther &s;uccour and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, before they are in any method of &s;upporting them&s;elves. And God forbid, that any of us who have e&s;caped this calamity, &s;hould be backward to di&s;tribute, or un|willing to communicate, as there may be occa&s;ion, and we have ability! One rea&s;on, we may well &s;up|po&s;e, why God has &s;pared our &s;ub&s;tance, is, that we might be in a capacity to relieve and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e, whom his holy providence has render'd objects of our charity. It is partly for their &s;akes, not wholly for our own, that our &s;ub&s;tance has been pre&s;erved. Nor can I indeed doubt, but that the people of the town will be generally di&s;po&s;ed to liberality on this occa&s;ion&punc; e&s;pecially when I reflect, how largely and chearfully
<PB N="36" REF="008665_0034_102FAB74CE409710">
they contributed a few months &s;ince, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>About a thou&s;and pounds lawful money was collected in the &s;everal religious a&s;&s;emblies in the town, for the relief of the &s;ufferers by the late fire near Oliver's dock: A large &s;um, con&s;idering the impoveri&s;h'd and declining &s;tate of the town, and the greatne&s;s of the public taxes. And tho' the di&s;po|&s;ition of the people be &s;till the &s;ame, and the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion much greater, and more urgent than the former; yet it will naturally be remember'd&punc; that our ability is now le&s;s than it was then. The more the town then gave away, the le&s;s it now has to give: And many who&punc; as we &s;uppo&s;e, con|tributed largely on that occa&s;ion&punc; are &s;o far from being able to do the like now, that they need relief them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped therefore, that our friends and brethren who live in the country, where their &s;ituation &s;ecures them &s;o ef|fectually again&s;t calamities of this nature, will &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;ider the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition of the town&punc; and &s;hew their chri&s;tian benevolence on this occa&s;ion&punc; agreeably to the <HI>Brief</HI> which his Excellency the Governor has i&s;&s;ued out. And we are the more encouraged to expect this, by reflecting how chearfully &s;ome of them made collections for the poor among&s;t us, at the time of the la&s;t general &s;mall pox in the town.&mdash;"With &s;uch &s;acrifices God is well plea&s;ed."</P></NOTE></P>
<P>BUT it is time to draw to a conclu&s;ion of this di&s;|cour&s;e. When God's judgments are abroad in the earth, it is then more e&s;pecially incumbent upon the inhabitants thereof to learn righteou&s;ne&s;s. If we do not regard the pa&s;t, or pre&s;ent, there may probably be other, and heavier ones, in &s;tore for us. At lea&s;t it is certain, that the wicked &s;hall not finally e&s;cape the righteous judgment of God. <Q>For behold the day cometh that &s;hall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, &s;hall be as &s;tubble; and the day that cometh &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, that it &s;hall leave them neither root nor branch.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal.

&s;een, e&s;pecially in the night, diffu&s;es general terror and di&s;tre&s;s. What then will be the con&s;ternation, how great the amazement, of a guilty world, when the Son of man &s;hall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not his go&s;pel! The old world peri&s;hed by water: But the heavens and the earth that now are, are re&s;erved unto fire, again&s;t the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men. And even the&s;e le&s;&s;er fires and conflagrations, which &s;trike us with &s;o much awe, may naturally remind us of that general, and far more awful one, which the prophets and apo&s;tles have foretold; when the earth it&s;elf, with the works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat.&mdash;<Q>Seeing then that all the&s;e things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, what manner of per|&s;ons ought we to be, in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s? looking for&punc; and ha&s;ting unto, the com|ing of the day of God!</Q>&mdash;To the wicked this will be a day of unutterable woe; but to them that fear his name, and &s;erve him, a day of triumph and exul|tation.
