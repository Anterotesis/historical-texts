<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great plea&s;ure I &s;ee at la&s;t the pre&s;ervation of Children become the care of Men of Sen&s;e: it is certainly a matter that well de&s;erves their attention, and, I doubt not, the Public will &s;oon find the good and great effects of it. The FOUNDLING HOSPITAL may be of more u&s;e to the world, than was per|haps at fir&s;t imagined by the promoters of it; it will be a means not only of preventing the murder of many, but of &s;aving more, by intro|ducing a more rea&s;onable and more natural method of nur&s;ing. In my opinion, this bu&s;i|ne&s;s has been too long fatally left to the ma|nagement of Women, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="012344_0003_0F88EF18E1F348C0">to have proper knowledge to fit them for &s;uch a ta&s;k, notwith&s;tanding they look upon it to be their own province. What I mean is, a phi|lo&s;ophic knowledge of Nature, to be acquired only by learned ob&s;ervation and experience, and which therefore the unlearned mu&s;t be incapa|ble of. They may pre&s;ume upon the examples and tran&s;mitted cu&s;toms of their Great grand|mothers, who were taught by the Phy&s;icians of their unenlightened days; when Phy&s;icians, as appears by late di&s;coveries, were mi&s;taken in many things, being led away by hypothetical rea&s;onings to entertain very wild conceits, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which they were greatly bewildered them&s;elves, and mi&s;led others to believe I know not what &s;trange unaccountable powers in certain herbs, roots, and drugs; and al&s;o in &s;ome &s;uper&s;titi|ous practices and ceremonies; for all which no|tions, their being no real foundation in Nature, they ought to be looked upon as the effects of ignorance, or the artifices of de&s;igning Quacks; who found their account in pretending to great knowledge of their occult qualities, and impo&s;ing upon the credulous. The art of Phy&s;ic has been much improved within this la&s;t century; by ob&s;erving and following Na|ture more clo&s;ely, many u&s;eful di&s;coveries have
<PB N="5" REF="012344_0004_0F88EF19BB8B5CC8">been made, which help us to account for things in a natural way, that before &s;eemed my&s;terious and magical; and which have con&s;equently made the practice of it more conformable to rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e. This being the ca&s;e, there is great room to fear, that tho&s;e Nur&s;es who yet retain many of the&s;e traditional preju|dices, are capitally mi&s;taken in their manage|ment of Children in general, and fancying that Nature has left a great deal to their &s;kill and contrivance, often do much harm where they intend to do good. Of this I &s;hall endea|vour to convince them, by &s;hewing how I think children may be clothed, fed, and managed, with much le&s;s trouble to their Nur&s;es, and in|finitely greater ea&s;e, comfort, and &s;afety, to the little ones.</P>
<P>THE Foundlings under the care of the Ho&s;|pital, I pre&s;ume, will be bred in a very plain, &s;imple manner: they will therefore infallibly have more health, beauty, &s;trength, and &s;pirits; I might add under&s;tanding al&s;o, as all the fa|culties of the mind are well known to depend upon the organs of the body; &s;o that when the&s;e are in good order, the thinking part is mo&s;t alert and active; the contrary, when they
<PB N="6" REF="012344_0005_0F88EF1CE4BD7CB0">are di&s;turbed or di&s;ea&s;ed. When the&s;e advan|tages appear in favor of Children &s;o brought up, as I am confident in time they will, it may &s;erve to convince mo&s;t Nur&s;es, Aunts, Grand|mothers, &amp;c. how much they have hitherto been in the wrong, what mi&s;chief is done to Children, and what multitudes are de&s;troyed or &s;poiled, as well by cramming them with cakes, &s;weetmeats, &amp;c. till they foul their blood, choak their ve&s;&s;els, pall the appetite, and ruin every faculty of their bodies; as by cockering and indulging them, to the utter per|ver&s;ion of their naturally good temper, till they become quite froward and indocile.</P>
<P>When a man takes upon him to contradict received opinions and prejudices &s;anctified by time, it is expected he &s;hould bring valid proof of what he advances. The truth of what I &s;ay, that the treatment of Children in general is wrong, unrea&s;onable, and unnatural, will in a great mea&s;ure appear, if we but con&s;ider what a puny valetudinary race mo&s;t of our peo|ple of condition are; chiefly owing to bad nur&s;ing, and bad habits contracted early. But let any one, who would be fully convinced of this matter, look over the BILLS OF MOR|TALITY;
<PB N="7" REF="012344_0006_0F88EF1D00FDB538">there he may ob&s;erve, that almo&s;t half the number of tho&s;e who fill up that black li&s;t, die under five years of age: &s;o that half the people that come into the world, go out of it again before they become of the lea&s;t u&s;e to it, or them&s;elves. To me this &s;eems to de&s;erve &s;erious con&s;ideration; and yet I cannot find, that any one man of &s;en&s;e and public &s;pirit has ever attended to it at all; notwith&s;tanding the maxim in every one's mouth, that a multitude of inhabitants is the greate&s;t &s;trength and be&s;t &s;upport of a Commonwealth. The mi&s;conduct to which I mu&s;t impute a great part of the cala|mity, is too common and obvious to engage the idle and &s;peculative, who are to be caught only by very refined re&s;earches; and the bu&s;y part of mankind, where their immediate intere&s;t is not concerned, will always overlook what they &s;ee daily; it may be thought a natural evil, and &s;o is &s;ubmitted to without examination. But this is by no means the ca&s;e; and where it is entirely owing to mi&s;management, and po&s;&s;ibly may admit of a remedy, it is ridiculous to charge it upon Nature, and &s;uppo&s;e that infants are more &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;e and death than grown per&s;ons; on the contrary, they bear pain and di&s;ea&s;e much better, fevers e&s;pecially (as is plain
<PB N="8" REF="012344_0007_0F88EF1DAAEFB300">in the ca&s;e of the &s;mall-pox, generally mo&s;t fa|vorable to Children) and for the &s;ame rea&s;on that a twig is le&s;s hurt by a &s;torm than an oak. In all the other productions of Nature, we &s;ee the greate&s;t vigour and luxuriancy of health, the nearer they are to the egg or the bud; they are indeed then mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of injury, and it is injury only that de&s;troys them. When was there a lamb, a bird, or a tree, that died be|cau&s;e it was young? The&s;e are under the im|mediate nur&s;ing of unerring Nature, and they thrive accordingly. Ought it not therefore to be the care of every Nur&s;e and every Parent, not only to protect their Nur&s;elings from inju|ry, but to be well a&s;&s;ured that their own offici|ous &s;ervices be not the greate&s;t the helple&s;s creatures can &s;uffer?</P>
<P>IN the lower cla&s;s of Mankind, e&s;pecially in the country, di&s;ea&s;e and mortality are not &s;o fre|quent, either among the adult or their children. Health and po&s;terity are the portion of the poor, I mean the laborious. The want of &s;u|perfluity confines them more within the limits of Nature: hence they enjoy ble&s;&s;ings they feel not, and are ignorant of their cau&s;e. The Mo|ther who has only a few rags to cover her child loo&s;ely, and little more than her own brea&s;t to
<PB N="9" REF="012344_0008_0F88EF2332EFF678">feed it, &s;ees it healthy and &s;trong, and very &s;oon able to &s;hift for it&s;elf; while the puny in&s;ect, the heir and hope of a rich family, lies lan|gui&s;hing under a load of finery that overpowers his limbs, abhorring and rejecting the dainties he is crammed with, till he dies a victim to the mi&s;taken care and tenderne&s;s of his fond Mo|ther. In the cour&s;e of my practice, I have had frequent occa&s;ion to be fully &s;atisfied of this, and have often heard a mother anxiou&s;ly &s;ay,
<Q>The Child has not been well ever &s;ince it has done puking and crying.</Q>
The&s;e com|plaints, though not attended to, point very plainly to their cau&s;e. Is it not very evident, that when a Child rids its &s;tomach &s;everal times in a day, that it has been over-loaded? when it cries, from the incumbrance and confinement of its cloaths, that it is hurt by them? While the natural &s;trength la&s;ts (as every Child is born with more health and &s;trength than is generally immagined), it cries at or rejects the &s;uperfluous load, and thrives apace: that is, grows very fat, bloated, and di&s;tended beyond mea&s;ure, like a hou&s;e-lamb. But in time, the &s;ame oppre&s;&s;ive cau&s;e continuing, the natural powers are over|come, being no longer able to throw off the un|equal
<PB N="10" REF="012344_0009_0F88EF24D3E48398">weight; the Child, not now able to cry any more, langui&s;hes and is quiet. The misfor|tune is, the&s;e complaints are not under&s;tood! it is &s;waddled and crammed on, 'till after gripes, purging, &amp;c. it &s;inks under both burdens into a convul&s;ion-fit, and e&s;capes any farther torture. This would be the ca&s;e with the lamb, was it not killed when it is full fat.</P>
<P>THAT the pre&s;ent method of nur&s;ing is wrong, one would think needed no other proof than the frequent mi&s;carriages attending it, the death of many, and ill health of tho&s;e that &s;urvive. But the per&s;uading you of it may be a needle&s;s ta&s;k; if you have ever thought about it, I doubt not but you are already con|vinced it is &s;o. However, &s;ince you de&s;ire my &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject, taking it for grant|ed you think with me, that mo&s;t of our Nur&s;es are in a wrong method, I will endeavour, in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, to tell you what I think a right one.</P>
<P>YOU perceive, Sir, by the hints I have alrea|dy dropped, what I am going to complain of is, that Children in general are over-cloathed and over-fed; and fed and cloathed improper|ly.
<PB N="11" REF="012344_0010_0F88EF2529BED038">To the&s;e cau&s;es I impute almo&s;t all their di&s;ea&s;es. But to be a little more explicit. The fir&s;t great mi&s;take is, that they think a new-born infant cannot be kept too warm: from this prejudice they load and bind it with flan|nels, wrappers, &s;wathes, &s;tays, &amp;c. which all together are almo&s;t equal to it's own weight; by which means a healthy Child in a month's time is made &s;o tender and chilly, it cannot bear the external air; and if, by any accident of a door or window left carele&s;sly open too long, a refre&s;hing breeze be admitted into the &s;uffocating atmo&s;phere of the lying-in bed|chamber, the child and Mother &s;ometimes catch irrecoverable colds. But, what is wor&s;e than this, at the end of the month, if things go on apparently well, this hot-bed plant is &s;ent out into the country to be reared in a leaky hou&s;e, that lets in wind and rain from every quarter. Is it any wonder the child never thrives after|wards? The truth is, a new-born Child can|not well be too cool and loo&s;e in its dre&s;s; it wants le&s;s cloathing than a grown per&s;on in proportion, becau&s;e it is naturally warmer, as appears by the thermometer, and would there|fore bear the cold of a winter's night much better than any adult per&s;on whatever. There are
<PB N="12" REF="012344_0011_0F88EF25F7F65EC8">many in&s;tances, both antient and modern, of infants expo&s;ed and de&s;erted, that have lived &s;everal days. As it was the practice of antient times, in many parts of the world, to expo&s;e all tho&s;e whom the parents did not care to be incumbered with; that were deformed, or born under evil &s;tars; not to mention the many Foundlings picked up in LONDON &s;treets. The&s;e in&s;tances may &s;erve to &s;hew, that Na|ture has made Children able to bear even great hard&s;hips, before they are made weak and &s;ickly by their mi&s;taken Nur&s;es. But, be&s;ides the mi&s;|chief ari&s;ing from the weight and heat of the&s;e &s;waddling-cloaths, they are put on &s;o tight, and the Child is &s;o cramped by them, that its bowels have not room, nor the limbs any liber|ty, to act and exert them&s;elves in the free ea&s;y manner they ought. This is a very hurtful cir|cum&s;tance; for limbs that are not u&s;ed will ne|ver be &s;trong, and &s;uch tender bodies cannot bear much pre&s;&s;ure: the circulation re&s;trained by the compre&s;&s;ion of any one part, mu&s;t pro|duce unnatural &s;wellings in &s;ome other; e&s;pe|cially as the fibres of infants are &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;|tended. To which doubtle&s;s are owing the many di&s;tortions and deformities we meet with
<PB N="13" REF="012344_0012_0F88EF26AA371548">every-where; cheifly among Women, who &s;uffer more in this particular than the Men.</P>
<P>IF Nur&s;es were capable of making ju&s;t ob|&s;ervations, they might &s;ee and take notice of that particular happine&s;s, which a Child &s;hews by all its powers of expre&s;&s;ion, when it is newly undre&s;&s;ed. How plea&s;ed! how delighted! it is with this new liberty, when indulged for a few minutes with the free u&s;e of its legs and arms. But this is not to la&s;t long; it is &s;wad|dled up as before, notwith&s;tanding all its cries and complaints.</P>
<P>I WOULD recommend the following dre&s;s: A little flannel wai&s;tcoat, without &s;leeves, made to fit the body, and tie loo&s;ely behind; to which there &s;hould be a petticoat &s;ewed, and over this a kind of gown of the &s;ame material, or any o|ther that is light, thin, and flim&s;ey. The petti|coat &s;hould not be quite &s;o long as the Child, the gown a few inches longer; with one cap only on the head, which may be made double, if it be thought not warm enough. What I mean is, that the whole coiffure &s;hould be &s;o contrived, that it might be put on at once, and neither bind nor pre&s;s the head at all: the linen
<PB N="14" REF="012344_0013_0F88EF276D0DC0A0">as u&s;ual. This I think would be abundantly &s;ufficient for the day; laying a&s;ide all tho&s;e &s;wathes, bandages, &s;tays, and contrivances, that are mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly u&s;ed to clo&s;e and keep the head in its place, and &s;upport the body. As if nature, exact Nature, had produced her chief work, a human creature, &s;o carele&s;sly unfini&s;hed as to want tho&s;e idle aids to make it perfect. Shoes and &s;tockings are very needle&s;s incum|brances; be&s;ides that they keep the legs wet and na&s;ty, if they are not changed every hour, and often cramp and hurt the feet: a child would &s;tand firmer, and learn to walk much &s;ooner without them. I think they cannot be nece&s;&s;ary till it runs out in the dirt. There &s;hould be a thin flannel &s;hirt for the night, which ought to be every way quite loo&s;e. Children in this &s;imple, plea&s;ant dre&s;s, which may be readily put on and off without teazing them, would find them&s;elves perfectly ea&s;y and happy, enjoying the free u&s;e of their limbs and facul|ties, which they would very &s;oon begin to em|ploy when they are thus left at liberty. I would have them put into it as &s;oon as they are born, and continued in it till they are three years old; when it may be changed for any other more genteel and fa&s;hionable: though I could wi&s;h
<PB N="15" REF="012344_0014_0F88EF28B72EE078">it was not the cu&s;tom to wear &s;tays at all; not becau&s;e I &s;ee no beauty in the &s;ugar-loaf &s;hape, but that I am apprehen&s;ive it is often procured at the expence of health and &s;trength of body. There is an odd notion enough entertained a|bout change, and the keeping of children clean. Some imagine that clean linen and fre&s;h cloaths draw, and rob them of their nouri&s;hing juices. I cannot &s;ee that they do any thing more than imbibe a little of that moi&s;ture which their bo|dies exhale. Were it, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, it would be of &s;ervice to them; &s;ince they are always too abundantly &s;upplied, and therefore I think they cannot be changed too often, and would have them clean every day; as it would free them from &s;tinks and &s;ourne&s;&s;es, which are not only offen&s;ive, but very prejudicial to the tender &s;tate of infancy.</P>
<P>THE feeding of Children properly is of much greater importance to them than their cloathing. We ought to take great care to be right in this material article, and that nothing be given them but what is whole&s;ome and good for them, and in &s;uch quantity as the body calls for towards it's &s;upport and growth; not a grain more. Let us con&s;ider what Nature directs in
<PB N="16" REF="012344_0015_0F88EF29A24930F0">the ca&s;e: If we follow Nature, in&s;tead of lead|ing or driving it, we cannot err. In the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Nur&s;ing, as well as Phy&s;ic. Art is ever de&s;tructive, if it does not exactly copy this o|riginal. When a Child is fir&s;t born, there &s;eems to be no provi&s;ion at all made for it; for the Mother's milk, as it is now managed, &s;el|dom comes till the third day; &s;o that according to this appearance of Nature, a Child would be left a day and a half, or two days, without any food. Were this really the ca&s;e, it would be a &s;ufficient proof that it wanted none; as indeed it does not immediately; for it is born full of blood, full of excrement, it's appetites not a|wake, nor it's &s;en&s;es opened; and requires &s;ome intermediate time of ab&s;tinence and re&s;t to com|po&s;e and recover the &s;truggle of the birth and the change of circulation (the blood runing in|to new channels), which always puts it into a little fever. However extraordinary this might appear, I am &s;ure it would be better that the Child was not fed even all that time, than as it generally is fed; for it would &s;leep the greate&s;t part of the time, and, when the milk was ready for it, would be very hungry, and &s;uck with more eagerne&s;s; which is often nece&s;&s;ary, for it &s;eldom comes freely at fir&s;t. But let me en|deavor
<PB N="17" REF="012344_0016_0F88EF2CC956DA98">to reconcile this difficulty, that a Child &s;hould be born thus apparently unprovided for. I &s;ay apparently, for in reality it is not &s;o. Nature neither intended that a Child &s;hould be kept &s;o long fa&s;ting, nor that we &s;hould feed it for her. Her de&s;ign is broke in upon, and a difficulty rai&s;ed that is wholly owing to mi&s;taken manage|ment. The Child, as &s;oon as it is born, is ta|ken from the Mother, and not &s;uffered to &s;uck till the Milk comes of it&s;elf; but is either fed with &s;trange and improper things, or put to &s;uck &s;ome other Woman, who&s;e Milk flow|ing in a full &s;tream, overpowers the new-born infant, that has not yet learnt to &s;wallow, and &s;ets it a coughing, or gives it a hiccup: the mother is left to &s;truggle with the load of her milk, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;ucking of the Child. Thus two great evils are produced, the one a prejudice to the Child's health, the other the danger of the Mother's life, at lea&s;t the retard|ing her recovery, by cau&s;ing what is called a milk-fever; which has been thought to be na|tural, but &s;o far from it, that it is entirely owing to this mi&s;conduct. I am confi|dent from experience, that there would be no fever at all, were things managed rightly: were the Child kept without food of any kind 'till it was hungry, which it is impo&s;&s;ible it
<PB N="18" REF="012344_0017_0F88EF2D67C463B0">&s;hould be ju&s;t after the birth, and then applied to the Mother's brea&s;ts; it would &s;uck with &s;trength enough, after a few repeated tri|als, to make the milk flow gradually, in due proportion to the Child's unexerci&s;ed faculty of &s;wallowing, and the call of it's &s;tomach. Thus the Child would not only provide for it|&s;elf the be&s;t of nouri&s;hment, but, by opening a free pa&s;&s;age for it, would take off the Mother's load, as it increa&s;ed, before it could oppre&s;s or hurt her; and therefore effectually prevent the fever; which is cau&s;ed only by the painful di&s;|tention of the lacteal ve&s;&s;els of the brea&s;ts, when the milk is injudiciou&s;ly &s;uffered to accumulate. Here let me de&s;cribe a ca&s;e of pure Nature, in order to illu&s;trate this material point yet farther. When a healthy young Woman lies-in of her fir&s;t Child, before the operations of Nature have been perverted by any ab&s;urd practices, her labor would be &s;trong, and, as I have cho|&s;en to in&s;tance in the ca&s;e of a fir&s;t Child, per|haps difficult; but in a few minutes after her delivery, &s;he and her Child if it be not injured, would fall into a &s;weet &s;leep of &s;ix or &s;even hours: the Mother, if no poi&s;onous opiate has been unnece&s;&s;arily given her, would awake refre&s;hed, the Child hungry. A little thin broth with bread, or &s;ome &s;uch light food,
<PB N="19" REF="012344_0018_0F88EF332CDE2908">&s;hould then be given her; and &s;oon after the Child be put to &s;uck. In one hour or two the milk would infallibly flow; and, if nothing el&s;e be given it, the Child would grow &s;trong, and &s;he recover perfectly in a few days. This is the con|&s;tant cour&s;e of nature, which is very little at|tended to, and never followed. The general practice is as &s;oon as a Child is born, to cram a dab of butter and &s;ugar down it's throat, a little oil, panada, caudle, or &s;ome &s;uch un|whol&s;ome me&s;s. So that they &s;et out wrong, and the Child &s;tands a fair chance of being made &s;ick from the fir&s;t hour. It is the cu&s;tom of &s;ome to give a little roa&s;t pig to an infant, which, it &s;eems, is to cure it of all the Mother's long|ings. Much non&s;ence has been propagated, and believed, about Womens longings, with|out any foundation in truth and nature. I wi&s;h the&s;e matters were a little more enquired into, for the honor of the &s;ex, to which many imperfections of this kind are imputed, which I am &s;ure it does not lie under.</P>
<P>HERE I may be a&s;ked, What is to be done with the Child born &s;ick, that, in&s;tead of &s;leep|ing, cries ince&s;&s;antly from the birth, and is hard|ly to be quieted by any means? Let good
<PB N="20" REF="012344_0019_0F88EF34D4CE6698">care be taken that it is not hurt by the dre&s;&s;ing, or rather let it not be dre&s;&s;ed at all, but wrap|ped up in a loo&s;e flannel. If notwith&s;tanding this precaution, it &s;till continues crying; in|&s;tead of feeding it, for it is certainly a prepo&s;|terous thing to think of feeding a Child be|cau&s;e it is &s;ick, though po&s;&s;ibly this may &s;top its mouth for a little while; let it be applied to the Mother's brea&s;t, perhaps it may bring the milk immediately; which would be the be&s;t me|dicine for it in &s;uch a ca&s;e; or the nipple in its mouth may quiet it, though it does not bring it. And it is certainly better it &s;hould be quieted without food than with it, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make it wor&s;e. Sometimes indeed the child may be &s;o very ill, that it will not e|ven attempt to &s;uck. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, which I think can happen but rarely, where Children are unavoidably to be dry nur&s;ed, let the phy|&s;ic I &s;hall recommend a little farther on, be given, a little every hour, 'till it takes effect; &s;till attempting to bring it to &s;uck the Mother's milk, which is the be&s;t Phy&s;ick or food it can take.</P>
<P>WHEN a Child &s;ucks it's own Mother, which, with a very few exceptions, would be
<PB N="21" REF="012344_0020_0F88EF34E9D605A0">be&s;t for every Child and every Mother, Nature has provided it with &s;uch whol&s;ome and &s;uitable nouri&s;hment; &s;uppo&s;ing her a temperate Wo|man, that makes &s;ome u&s;e of her limbs, it can hardly do ami&s;s. The Mother would likewi&s;e, in mo&s;t hy&s;terical nervous ca&s;es, e&s;tabli&s;h her own health by it though &s;he were weak and &s;ickly before, as well as that of her offspring. For the&s;e rea&s;ons I could wi&s;h, that every Woman that is able, who&s;e fountains are not greatly di|&s;turbed or tainted, would give &s;uck to her Child. I am very &s;ure, that forcing back the milk, which mo&s;t young Women mu&s;t have in great abundance, may be of fatal con&s;equence: &s;ometimes it endangers life, and often lays the foundation of many incurable di&s;ea&s;es. The rea|&s;ons that are given for this practice are very frivo|lous, and drawn from fal&s;e premi&s;es; that &s;ome Women are too weak to bear &s;uch a drain, which would rob them of their nouri&s;hment. This is a very mi&s;taken notion; for the fir&s;t general cau&s;e of mo&s;t peoples di&s;ea&s;es is, not want of nouri&s;hment as here imagined, but too great a fulne&s;s and redundancy of humours; good at fir&s;t, but, be|ing more than the body can employ or con|&s;ume, they &s;tagnate, degenerate, and the whole ma&s;s becomes corrupt, and produces many di&s;|ea&s;es.
<PB N="22" REF="012344_0021_0F88EF35AF82C010">This is confirmed by the general prac|tice of Phy&s;icians, who make holes in the &s;kin, perpetual bli&s;ters, i&s;&s;ues, &amp;c. to let out the &s;u|perfluity. I would therefore leave it to be con&s;i|dered, whether the throwing back &s;uch a load of humour, as a Woman's fir&s;t milk, be mo&s;t like|ly to mend her con&s;titution, or make her com|plaints irremediable. The Mother's fir&s;t milk is purgative, and clean&s;es the Child of it's long-hoarded excrement; no Child, therefore, can be deprived of it without manife&s;t injury. By degrees it changes its property, becomes le&s;s purgative, and more nouri&s;hing; and is the be&s;t and only food the Child likes, or ought to have for &s;ome time. If I could prevail, no Child &s;hould ever be crammed with any unnatural mixture, till the provi&s;ion of Nature was ready for it; nor afterwards fed with any ungenial alien diet whatever, at lea&s;t for the <HI>fir&s;t three months</HI>: for it is not able to dige&s;t and a&s;&s;imi|late other aliments &s;ooner. I have &s;een very healthy fine Children, that never eat or drank any thing whatever but the Mother's milk for the fir&s;t ten or twelve months. Nature &s;eems to direct this, by giving them no teeth 'till about that time. There is u&s;ually milk enough with the fir&s;t Child; &s;ometimes more than it can
<PB N="23" REF="012344_0022_0F88EF366D430D28">take: it is poured forth from an exuberant, overflowing urn, by a bountiful hand, that never provides &s;paringly. The call of Nature &s;hould be waited for to feed it with any thing more &s;ub&s;tantial, and the appetite ever precede the food; not only with regard to the daily meals, but tho&s;e changes of diet, which open|ing, increa&s;ing life requires. But this is never done in either ca&s;e, which is one the greate&s;t mi&s;takes of all Nur&s;es. Thus far Nature, if &s;he be not interrupted, will do the whole bu&s;ine&s;s perfectly well; and there &s;eems to be nothing left for a Nur&s;e to do, but to keep the Child clean and &s;weet, and to tumble and to&s;s it about a good deal, play with it, and keep it in good humour.</P>
<P>WHEN the Child requires more &s;olid &s;u&s;|tenance, we are to enquire what, and how much, is mo&s;t proper to give it. We may be well a&s;|&s;ured, there is a great mi&s;take either in the quan|tity or quality of Childrens food, or both, as it is u&s;ually given them; becau&s;e they are made &s;ick by it; for to this mi&s;take I cannot help im|puting nine in ten of all their di&s;ea&s;es. As to quantity, there is a mo&s;t ridiculous error in the common practice; for it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="24" REF="012344_0023_0F88EF3739080190">that whenever a Child cries, it wants victuals; and it is accordingly fed, ten, twelve, or more times in a day and night. This is &s;o obvious a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, that I am &s;urprized it &s;hould ever prevail. If a Child's wants and motions be diligently and judiciou&s;ly attended to, it will be found that it never cries but from pain: now the fir&s;t &s;en&s;ations of hunger are not attended with pain; accordingly a Child (I mean this of a very young one) that is hungry, will make a hundred other &s;igns of its want, before it will cry for food. If it be healthy and quite ea&s;y in it's dre&s;s, it will hardly ever cry at all. In|deed the&s;e &s;igns and motions I &s;peak of are but rarely to be ob&s;erved; becau&s;e it &s;eldom hap|pens that Children are ever &s;uffered to be hun|gry. In a few, very few, whom I have had the the plea&s;ure to &s;ee rea&s;onably nur&s;ed, that were not fed above two or three times in four and twenty hours, and yet were perfectly healthy, active, and happy; I have &s;een the&s;e &s;ignals, which were as intelligible as if they had &s;poken.</P>
<P>THERE are many faults in the quality of their food: it is not &s;imple enough. Their paps, panada's, gruels, &amp;c. are generally enrich|ed with &s;ugar, &s;pice, and &s;ometimes a drop of
<PB N="25" REF="012344_0024_0F88EF37F6EE60C0">wine; neither of which they ought ever to ta&s;te. Our bodies never want them: they are what luxury only has introduced, to the de&s;truc|tion of the health of mankind. It is not enough that their food be &s;imple, it &s;hould be al&s;o light. Several people, I find, are mi&s;taken in their no|tions of what is light; and fancy that mo&s;t kinds of pa&s;try, puddings, cu&s;tards, &amp;c. are light, that is, light of dige&s;tion. But there is nothing heavier in this &s;en&s;e than unfermented flour and eggs boiled hard, which are the chief ingredients of tho&s;e preparations. What I mean by light, to give the be&s;t idea I can of it, is any &s;ub&s;tance that is ea&s;ily &s;eparated, and &s;oluble in warm water. Good bread is the lighte&s;t thing I know; the power of due fermentation, in which con&s;i&s;ts the whole art of making it, breaks and attenuates the tenacious particles of the flour, &s;o as to give it the&s;e qualities I men|tion, and make it the fitte&s;t food for young Children. Cowes milk is al&s;o &s;imple and light, and very good for them; but it is injudiciou&s;ly prepared: it &s;hould not be boiled, for boiling alters the ta&s;te and property of it, de&s;troys it's &s;weetne&s;s, and makes it thicker, heavier, and le&s;s fit to mix and a&s;&s;imilate with the blood.
<PB N="26" REF="012344_0025_0F88EF3999D79DA8">But the chief objection is, that their food is wholly vegetable, the bad con&s;equence of which is, that it will turn &s;our in their &s;tomachs. The fir&s;t and general cau&s;e of all the di&s;ea&s;es of in|fants, is manife&s;tly this ace&s;cent quality of all their food. If any of the&s;e vegetable prepera|tions I have named, be kept in a degree of heat equal to that of a Child's &s;tomach, it will be|come &s;our as vinegar in a few hours time. The&s;e things are therefore very improper to feed a Child wholly with. Some part of it's diet &s;hould be contrived to have a contrary tenden|cy; &s;uch as we find only in fle&s;h, which is the direct oppo&s;ite to acid, and tends to putrefacti|on. In a due mixture of the&s;e two extremes, correcting each other, con&s;i&s;ts that &s;alubrity of aliment our nature &s;eems to require. As we are partly carnivorous animals, a child ought not to be fed wholly upon vegetables. The Mother's milk, when it is perfectly good, &s;eems to be this true mixture of the animal and vegetable properties, that agrees be&s;t with the con&s;titution of a Child; readily pa&s;&s;es into good blood, requiring but a gentle exer|tion of the powers of circulation to break and &s;ubdue it's particles and make them &s;mooth and round, and ea&s;ily divi&s;ible. I would ad|vi&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="012344_0026_0F88EF3A31A20630">therefore, that one half of infants diet be thin light broths, with a little bread or rice boiled in them; which la&s;t is not &s;o ace&s;cent as any other kind of meal or flour. The&s;e broths &s;hould be made with the fle&s;h of full-grown animals, becau&s;e their juices are more ela|borate; e&s;pecially if they have never been con|fined to be fatted. The juices of a young ox, taken from the plough, make the fine&s;t fla|voured and mo&s;t whol&s;ome &s;oup. I believe it is for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the fle&s;h of all wild ani|mals has a higher ta&s;te than that of tame, &s;agi|nated ones, and is therefore mo&s;t agreeable to the palate of the luxurious: but this is to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e creatures that feed on corn or herbage. The other part of Childrens diet may be a little toa&s;ted bread and water boiled almo&s;t dry and then mixed with fre&s;h milk, not boiled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The LONDON Bakers are &s;u&s;pected of putting Alum in their bread, which would be very pernicious to Infants; therefore ru&s;ks, or the bi&s;cuits called tops-and-bottoms, or rice may be u&s;ed in&s;tead of it. The&s;e will not turn &s;our &s;o &s;oon as common bread; which quality is undoubtedly an objection to u&s;ing much of it, e&s;pecially when Children are weakly. The &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t method in my opinion is not to feed them at all; at lea&s;t till they are &s;ix or eight months old. The fine&s;t Children I ever &s;aw lived wholly upon &s;ucking till after that age.</NOTE>. This without &s;ugar, &s;pice, or any
<PB N="28" REF="012344_0027_0F88EF3AEAAB4F30">other pretended amendment whatever, would be perfectly light and whol&s;ome, of &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment, &s;omething like milk from the cow, with the additional &s;trength and &s;pirit of bread in it. Twice a day, and not oftener, a &s;ucking Child &s;hould be fed at fir&s;t; once with the broth, and once with the milk thus pre|pared. As to the quantity at each time, it's appetite mu&s;t be the mea&s;ure of that; it's hunger &s;hould be &s;atisfied, but no more; for Children will always eat with &s;ome eagerne&s;s full as much as they ought: therefore it mu&s;t be very wrong to go beyond that, and &s;tuff them 'till they &s;pew, as the common method is. They &s;hould not be laid on their backs to be fed, but held in a &s;itting po&s;ture, that &s;wal|lowing may be ea&s;ier to them, and that they may the more readily di&s;cover when they have had enough. When they come to be about TEN or TWELVE MONTHS old, and their appetite &amp; dige&s;tion grows &s;trong, they may be fed three times a day; which, I think, they ought never to exceed their whole lives after. By night I
<PB N="29" REF="012344_0028_0F88EF3CEFC20F18">would not have them fed or &s;uckled at all, that they might at lea&s;t be hungry in the morning. It is this night feeding that makes them &s;o over|fat and bloated. If they be not u&s;ed to it at at fir&s;t, and, perhaps, awaked on purpo&s;e, they will never &s;eek it; and if they are not di&s;turb|ed from the birth, in a week's time they will get into a habit of &s;leeping all or mo&s;t part of the night very quietly; awaking po&s;&s;ibly once or twice for a few minutes when they are wet, and ought to be changed. Their meals, and in my opinion, their &s;ucking too, ought to be at &s;tated times, and the &s;ame every day; that the &s;tomach may have intervals to dige&s;t, and the appetite return. The Child would &s;oon be quite ea&s;y &amp; &s;atisfied in the habit; much more &s;o, than when taught to expect food at all times, and at every little fit of crying and unea&s;ine&s;s. Let this method be ob&s;erved about a TWELVE-MONTH, when, and not before, they may be weaned; not all at once, but by in&s;en&s;ible de|grees; that they may neither feel, nor fret at the want of the brea&s;t. This might be very ea|&s;ily managed, if they were &s;uffered to &s;uck only at certain times. Were this plan of nur&s;ing literally pur&s;ued, the Children kept clean and &s;weet, tumbled and to&s;&s;ed about a good deal,
<PB N="30" REF="012344_0029_0F88EF3DDB628750">and carried out every day in all weathers, I am confident, that in &s;ix or eight months time mo&s;t Children would become healthy and &s;trong, would be able to &s;it up on the ground without &s;upport, to divert them&s;elves an hour at a time, to the great relief of their Nur&s;es, would readily find the u&s;e of their legs, and very &s;oon &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IF it be a&s;ked, whether I mean this of chil|dren in general, and that weakly ones, born of unhealthy parents, &s;hould be treated in the &s;ame manner; I an&s;wer, that it is not &s;o common for Children to inherit the di&s;ea&s;es of their parents, as is generally imagined; there is much vul|gar error in this opinion; for people that are very unhealthy &s;eldom have Children, e&s;pecially if the bad health be of the female &s;ide; and it is generally late in life when chronic di&s;ea&s;es take place in mo&s;t Men, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of love is pretty well over: certainly Children can have no title to tho&s;e infirmities, which their parents have acquired by indolence and intem|perance long after their birth. It is not com|mon for people to complain of ails they think hereditary, 'till they are grown up; that is, 'till they have contributed to them by their own ir|regularities
<PB N="31" REF="012344_0030_0F88EF3F75EBCD70">and exce&s;&s;es, and then are glad to throw their own faults back upon their Pa|rents, and lament a bad con&s;titution, when they have &s;poiled a very good one. It is very &s;el|dom that young Children are troubled with family-di&s;tempers: indeed, when we find them affected with &s;crophulous or venereal complaints we may rea&s;onably conclude the taint to have been tran&s;mitted to them; but the&s;e ca&s;es are very rare in compari&s;on of the many others that are fal&s;ly, and without the lea&s;t foundation, imput|ted to Parents, when the real cau&s;e is either in the complainants them&s;elves, or bad nur&s;ing that has fixed them early in wrong habits. In one &s;en&s;e many di&s;ea&s;es may be &s;aid to be here|ditary, prehaps all tho&s;e of malformation; by which I mean not only deformity and di&s;tortion, but all tho&s;e ca&s;es where the fibres and ve&s;&s;els of one part are weaker in proportion than the re&s;t; &s;o that upon any &s;train of the body, whether of debauch or too violent exerci&s;e, the weak part fails fir&s;t, and di&s;orders the whole. Thus complaints may be produced &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Parent, owing in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the &s;imilitude of parts, which po&s;&s;ibly is inhe|rited, like the features of the face; but yet the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es might never have appeared, but for the immediate acting cau&s;e, the violence done
<PB N="32" REF="012344_0031_0F88EF40275DE180">to the body. Mo&s;t di&s;tempers have two cau|&s;es; the one a particular &s;tate of the &s;olids and fluids of the body, which di&s;po&s;e it to re|cive certain infections and impul&s;es; the other, the infection or impul&s;e it&s;elf. Now what I contend for is, that though this predi&s;ponent &s;tate or habit of the body be heritable, yet the di&s;ea&s;es incident to the&s;e wretched heirs may be avoided, by preventing the active cau&s;e; which may be done in many ca&s;es by a due attenton to the non-naturals, as they are called; in plain|er words, by a temperate, active life: in Child|ren, by good nur&s;ing. Therefore I conclude, that in&s;tead of indulging and enfeebling yet more, by the common methods, Children &s;o unhappily born; that which I am recommend|ing, together with the whol&s;ome milk of a healthy Nur&s;e, is the be&s;t, the only means to remedy the evil, and by which alone they may by degrees be made healthy and &s;trong. And thus, in a generation or two of rea&s;onable tem|perate per&s;ons, every taint and infirmity what|ever, the king's-evil and madne&s;s not excepted, would be totally worn out.</P>
<P>THE plain natural plan I have laid down is never followed, becau&s;e mo&s;t Mothers, of any
<PB N="33" REF="012344_0032_0F88EF4545D5A318">condition, either cannot, or will not undertake the trouble&s;ome ta&s;k of &s;uckling their own Children; which is trouble&s;ome only for want of proper method; were it rightly managed, their would be much plea&s;ure in it, to every Woman that can prevail upon her&s;elf to give up a little of the beauty of her brea&s;t to feed her offspring; though this is a mi&s;taken notion, for the brea&s;ts are not &s;poiled by giving &s;uck, but by growing fat. There would be no fear of offending the hu&s;band's ears with the noi&s;e of the &s;qualling brat. The Child, was it nur&s;ed in this way, would be always quiet, in good humour, ever playing, laughing, or &s;leeping. In my opinion, a Man of &s;en&s;e cannot have a prettier rattle (for rattles he mu&s;t have of one kind or other) than &s;uch a young Child. I am quite at a lo&s;s to account for the general prac|tice of &s;ending infants out of doors, to be &s;uck|led or dry-nur&s;ed by another Woman, who has not &s;o much under&s;tanding, nor can have &s;o much affection for it as the Parents; and how it comes to pa&s;s, that people of good &s;en&s;e and ea&s;y circum&s;tances will not give them&s;elves the pains to watch over the health and welfare of their Children; but are &s;o carele&s;s as to give
<PB N="34" REF="012344_0033_0F88EF46ED16B980">them up to the common methods, without con|&s;idering how near it is to an equal chance, that they are de&s;troyed by them. The antient cu&s;|tom of expo&s;ing them to wild bea&s;ts, or drown|ing them, would certainly be a much quicker and more humane way of di&s;patching them. There are &s;ome, however who wi&s;h to have Children, and to pre&s;erve them, but are mi&s;|taken in their cares about them. To &s;uch on|ly I would addre&s;s my&s;elf, and recommend it to every Father to have his Child nur&s;ed under his own eye, to make u&s;e of his own rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e in &s;uperintending and directing the ma|nagement of it; nor &s;uffer it to be made one of the my&s;teries of the <HI>Bona Dea,</HI> from which the Men are to be excluded. I would advi&s;e every Mother that can, for her own &s;ake, as well as her Child's to &s;uckle it. If &s;he be a healthy Woman, it will confirm her health; if weakly, in mo&s;t ca&s;es it will re&s;tore her. It need be no confinement to her, or abridgment of her time; four times in four and twenty hours will be of|ten enough to give it &s;uck; letting it have as much as it will take out of both brea&s;ts at each time. It may be fed and dre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome han|dy rea&s;onable &s;ervant, that will &s;ubmit to be di|rected; whom likewi&s;e it may &s;leep with. No
<PB N="35" REF="012344_0034_0F88EF4900231478">other Woman's milk can be &s;o good for her Child; and dry-nur&s;ing I look upon to be the mo&s;t unnatural and dangerous method of all; and, according to my ob&s;ervation, not one in three &s;urvives it. To breed a Child in this arti|ficial manner, requires more knowledge of Na|ture, and the animal oeconomy, than the be&s;t Nur&s;e was ever mi&s;tre&s;s of, as well as more care and attention than is generally be&s;towed on Children; the &s;kill of a good Phy&s;ician would be nece&s;&s;ary to manage it rightly. I am very glad this is not the method of the Ho&s;pital: I believe there is not the lea&s;t colour of objection to any part of the management of that mo&s;t u&s;eful and excellent charity, as far as it depends upon the directors of it. Sending the Child|ren out to Country-nur&s;es, under the care of In|&s;pectors, is undoubtedly the be&s;t method they could take; but how far the&s;e Nur&s;es and their In&s;pectors (who, I &s;uppo&s;e, are to be &s;ome good Gentlewomen in the neighbourhood) may be per&s;uaded out of their old forms, to treat their Nur&s;elings a little more rea&s;onably, is matter of much doubt. I fear they will be too tenacious of their prejudices, as well as opinionated of their &s;kill, to be ea&s;ily convinced they are in the wrong; and who &s;hall undertake the ta&s;k?
<PB N="36" REF="012344_0035_0F88EF4933485390">However, I de&s;pair not of &s;eeing a reformation one day or other; and to contribute to it as as much as lies in my power, I will give you my opinion as to the precautions nece&s;&s;ary to be taken in the choice of the&s;e Nur&s;es; and like|wi&s;e a few rea&s;ons why the Children, entru&s;ted to their care, &s;hould be treated &s;ome-what dif|ferently from tho&s;e who are nur&s;ed in a more natural way, and &s;uck their own Mothers. I make no doubt, but great care is taken, that the Nur&s;es recommended to the Ho&s;pital be clean and healthy Women. But this is not enough; the preference &s;hould be given to the middle-aged; becau&s;e they will have more milk than the very young, and more and better than the old. This is a material con&s;ideration, as I &s;up|po&s;e they have each her own Child to &s;uckle be&s;ides. Tho&s;e between twenty and thirty are certainly of the be&s;t age. But what I think of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence is, that great regard &s;hould be had to the time of their lying-in, and tho&s;e procured, if po&s;&s;ible, who have not been bro't to bed above two or three months. The rea&s;on of this is, that Nature intending a Child &s;hould &s;uck about a twelvemonth, the milk &s;eldom con|tinues good much longer. About that time, Women in general, though they give &s;uck, are
<PB N="37" REF="012344_0036_0F88EF49F2B95A00">apt to breed again: &s;ome, indeed, that are very &s;anguine, will breed &s;ooner; the&s;e, not|with&s;tanding their milk, are apt to be troubled with the <HI>catamenia,</HI> which di&s;turb it greatly; and therefore are not &s;o proper to be made Nur&s;es of. But, whether they breed or not, it is my opinion, that after a year's time, or thereabouts, however it may agree with the Child that has &s;ucked it from the fir&s;t, their milk will become &s;tale and vapid, at lea&s;t very unfit for a new-born infant; that if it be depri|ved of it's own Mother's milk, ought undoubt|edly to have what is mo&s;t like it; the newer it is, the more &s;uitable in all re&s;pects to it's tender nature. Yet it is a common thing for a Wo|man to &s;uckle two or three Children &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly with the &s;ame milk.</P>
<P>A NURSE ought to have great regard to her diet: it is not enough that &s;he be &s;ober and temperate, her food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of a proper mixture of fle&s;h and vegetables: &s;he &s;hould eat one hearty meal of un&s;alted fle&s;h-meat eve|ry day, with a good deal of garden &s;tuff and a little bread. Thin broth or milk would be be&s;t for her breakfa&s;t and &s;upper. Her drink &s;hould be &s;mall beer, or milk and water; but upon no account &s;hould &s;he ever touch a drop
<PB N="38" REF="012344_0037_0F88EF4AA8E2CC00">of wine or &s;trong drink, much le&s;s any kind of &s;pirituous liquors: giving ale or brandy to a Nur&s;e is, in effect, giving it the Child; and it is ea&s;y to conclude what would be the con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>THE Children, likewi&s;e, thus &s;ent out, re|quire a particular treatment. The plan I would lay down, could I prevail, &s;hould be that of Nature, excluding Art and foreign aid entire|ly. But when this is broke in upon, a little adventitious &s;kill becomes indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary; that if we are not perfectly right in following clo&s;ely the de&s;ign of Nature, we may co-operate a little, and not be totally wrong in counter-acting it, as is too often the ca&s;e. What I mean is, that every Child, not allowed the Mother's fir&s;t milk, whether it be dry-nur&s;ed, or &s;uckled by another Woman, &s;hould be purged in a day or two after the birth; and this purging continued for &s;ome time: not by regular do&s;es of phy&s;ick, that may operate all at once; but &s;ome lenient laxative &s;hould he contrived, and given two or three times a day, &s;o as to keep the Child's body open for the fir&s;t nine days, or fortnight; le&s;&s;ening the quantity in&s;en&s;ibly, 'till it be left
<PB N="39" REF="012344_0038_0F88EF4B696EE348">off. It &s;hould be &s;o managed, that the opera|tion of the artifical phy&s;ick may re&s;emble that of the natural. This is &s;o material, that, for want of it, mo&s;t Children within the fir&s;t month break out in pimples all over; the Nur&s;es call it the red-gum, and look upon it to be a natu|ral thing, and that the children will be unheal|thy that have it not. So indeed they will be in all likelihood; and it is better that the&s;e foulne&s;&s;es, which become acrid and hot by re|maining too long in the body, &s;hould be di&s;|charged through the &s;kin; than not at all; or that they &s;hould be lodged in the blood, or fall upon the vitals, to lay the foundation of numberle&s;s future evils; but it is chiefly owing to the neglect of this method at fir&s;t. A Child that &s;ucks it's own mother, unle&s;s it be greatly over-fed, or kept too hot, will never be trou|bled with this humour at all. If the Children that are brought to the Ho&s;pital be not above a month old, and if it be found, upon enquiry, that they have not &s;ucked their own Mothers, &s;omething of this kind pre&s;cribed them would not be too late and improper. The following form may be u&s;ed: Take manna, pulp of ca&s;|&s;ia, of each half an ounce; di&s;&s;olve them in a|bout three ounces of thin broth. Let the
<PB N="40" REF="012344_0039_0F88EF4D884E6760">Child take two &s;poonfuls three times a day, va|rying the quantity according to the effect; which, at fir&s;t, ought to be three or four &s;tools in four and twenty hours.</P>
<P>ORDERS &s;hould be given the&s;e Nur&s;es to keep the Children awake by day, as long as they are di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;o, and to amu&s;e and keep them in good humour all they can; not to lull and rock them to &s;leep, or to continue their &s;leep too long; which is only done to &s;ave their own time and trouble, to the great detriment of the Childrens health, &s;pirits, and under&s;tand|ing. With regard to feeding them, as it is not likely they &s;hould have milk enough to &s;upport two, their own, and the Ho&s;pitial-|child; it is be&s;t they &s;hould begin immediately according to the method I have recommended, if they or their in&s;pectors can be per&s;uaded to think it right; which however, I would not have under&s;tood &s;o &s;trictly, but it might &s;ometimes be a little varied, pre&s;erving only the intention, I would advi&s;e, however, if it be thought pro|per, now and then, to give them, as they grow up, a little bread and butter perfectly &s;weet and fre&s;h, and allowed but in very &s;mall quan|tity; otherwi&s;e it will be apt to turn bitter
<PB N="41" REF="012344_0040_0F88EF4E66518260">and rancid in the &s;tomach, and foul all the jui|ces of the body. A Child may be allowed any kind of mellow fruit, either raw, &s;tewed, or baked; roots of all &s;orts, and all the pro|duce of the kitchen-garden. I am &s;ure all the&s;e things are whole&s;ome and good for them, and every one el&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the idle notion of their being windy, which they are only to very debauched &s;tomachs; and &s;o i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> milk; but no Man's blood wants the clean&s;ing refre&s;hing power of milk more than his, who&s;e &s;tomach, u&s;ed to inflammatory things of high reli&s;h, will not bear the fir&s;t chill of it. To Children, all this kind of food, taken in moderation, is perfectly grateful and &s;alutary. Some may think that they carry into the &s;tomach the eggs of future worms; but of this I am not very apprehen&s;ive; for I believe there are few things we eat or drink, that do not convey them. But then they can never be hatched in a healthy in&s;ide, where all the juices are &s;weet and good, and every gland performs it's of|fice: the gall in particular, would de&s;troy them: bullocks gall has been found to be a good and &s;afe vermifuge. It is my opinion, we &s;wallow the eggs of many little animals, that are never
<PB N="42" REF="012344_0041_0F88EF50071552F0">brought into life within us, except where they find a fit ne&s;t or lodgment in the acid phlegm or vitiated humours of the &s;tomach and bow|els. Were the&s;e totally di&s;charged every day, and the food of ye&s;terday employed in nouri&s;h|ment, and the &s;uperfluity thrown off to the la&s;t grain, no worms could ever breed or harbour in our vitals. As &s;oon as the Children have any teeth, at &s;ix or eight months they may by degrees be u&s;ed to a little flesh-meat; which they are always very fond of, much more &s;o at fir&s;t, than of any confectionary or pa&s;try wares, with which they &s;hould never debauch their ta&s;te.</P>
<P>BREEDING teeth has been thought to be, and is fatal to many Children; but I am confident this is not from Nature: for it is no di&s;ea&s;e, or we could not be well in health 'till one or two and twenty, or later. Teeth are breeding the greate&s;t part of that time; and it is my o|pinion, the la&s;t teeth give more pain than the fir&s;t, as the bones and gums they are to pierce, are grown more firm and hard. But, whatever fever, fits, or other dangerous &s;ymptoms &s;eem to attend this operation of Nature, healthy Children have &s;ometimes bred their teeth with|out
<PB N="43" REF="012344_0042_0F88EF50A613C1C8">any &s;uch bad attendants; which ought to incline us to &s;u&s;pect the evil not to be natural, but rather the effect of too great a fulne&s;s, or the corrupt humours of the body put into agi|tation by the &s;timulating pain the tooth cau&s;es in breaking its way out. This, I believe, ne|ver happens without &s;ome pain, and po&s;&s;ibly a little fever; but if the blood and juices be per|fectly &s;weet and good, and there be not too great a redundancy of them, both will be but &s;light, and pa&s;s off imperceptibly, without any bad con&s;equence whatever. The chief intenti|on of the method I am recommending is, to pre&s;erve the humours of the body in this &s;tate; and therefore, if it &s;ucceeds, Children &s;o mana|ged will breed their teeth with le&s;s pain and danger than are commonly ob&s;erved to attend this work of Nature.</P>
<P>AS I have &s;aid, that the fir&s;t and general cau&s;e of mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es infants are liable to is the acid corruption of their food; it may not be ami&s;s ju&s;t to mention an ea&s;y and certain re|medy, or rather preventative, if given timely, at the fir&s;t appearance of predominating acid; which is very obvious from the crude, white, or green &s;tools, gripes and purgings occa&s;ioned
<PB N="44" REF="012344_0043_0F88EF56C2660F38">by it. The common method, when the&s;e &s;ymp|toms appear, is to give the pearl-julep, crab's eye, and the te&s;taceous powders; which, though they do ab&s;orb the acidities, have this incon|venience in their effect, that they are apt to lodge in the body, and bring on a co&s;tivene&s;s, very detrimental to infants, and therefore re|quire a little manna, or &s;ome gentle purge, to be given frequently to carry them off. In&s;tead of the&s;e, I would recommend a certain fine in|&s;ipid powder, called <HI>Magne&s;ia alba,</HI> which, at the &s;ame time that it corrects and &s;weetens all &s;ourne&s;&s;es, rather more effectually than the te&s;taceous powders, is likewi&s;e a lenient purga|gative, and keeps the body gently open. This is the only alkaline purge I know of, and which our di&s;pen&s;atories have long wanted. I have taken it my&s;elf, and given it to others for the heart-burn, and find it to be the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual remedy for that complaint. It may be given to Children from one to two drams a day, a little at a time, in all their food, 'till the acidities be quite overcome, and the concomi|tant &s;ymptoms di&s;appear entirely. I have of|ten given it with good and great effect, even when the Children have been far gone in di&s;|ea&s;es fir&s;t brought on by prevailing acid.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="012344_0044_0F88EF584F88BEE0">IT is always ea&s;ier to prevent di&s;ea&s;es than to cure them; and as neither Children, nor in|deed grown per&s;ons, are ever &s;eized with chro|nic di&s;ea&s;es &s;uddenly, the progre&s;s of decay|ing health being perceptibly gradual, it is no difficult matter for a Phy&s;ician of common &s;kill to ob&s;erve the fir&s;t &s;tep towards illne&s;s, and to foretel the con&s;equence, in all tho&s;e who&s;e habit of life is well known to him. But to Parents and Nur&s;es in general, the&s;e ob&s;ervations may not occur; I will therefore point out a few cer|tain &s;igns and &s;ymptoms, by which they may be a&s;&s;ured that a Child's health is decaying, even before it appears to be &s;ick. If the&s;e are neglected, the evil increa&s;es, grows from bad to wor&s;e, and more violent and apparent com|plaints will follow, and perhaps end in incurable di&s;ea&s;es, which a timely remedy, or a &s;light change in the diet and manner of life, had in|fallibly prevented. The fir&s;t tendency to di&s;|ea&s;e may be ob&s;erved in a Child's breath. It is not enough the breath be not offen&s;ive; it &s;hould be &s;weet &amp; fragrant like a no&s;egay of fre&s;h flowers, or a pail of new milk from a young cow that feeds upon the &s;weete&s;t gra&s;s of the &s;pring; and this as well at fir&s;t waking in the morning, as all day long. It is always &s;o with Children
<PB N="46" REF="012344_0045_0F88EF58EA09BFD0">that are in perfect delicate health. As &s;oon, therefore, as a Child's breath is found to be either hot or &s;trong, or &s;our, we may be a&s;&s;ur|ed that dige&s;tion and &s;urfeit have fouled and and di&s;turbed the blood, and now is the time to apply a proper remedy, and prevent a train of impending evils. Let the Child be re&s;trained in it's food; eat le&s;s, live upon milk or thin broth for a day or two; be carried, or walk if it is able, a little more than u&s;ual in the open air. Let a little of this powder, or any other pro|per phy&s;ick, be given; not that I would ad|vi&s;e phy&s;ic to be made familiar, but one do&s;e admini&s;terd now would prevent the nece&s;|&s;ity of a great many, that might afterwards be pre&s;cribed with much le&s;s good effect.</P>
<P>IF this fir&s;t &s;ymptom of approaching illne&s;s be overlooked, the Child, who, if it was heal|thy, would lie quiet as a log all night, will have di&s;turbed &s;leep, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, terrifying dreams; will be talking, &s;tarting, kicking and tumbling about; or &s;miling and laughing, as is common with very young Children when they are griped, and the Nur&s;es &s;ay they &s;ee and conver&s;e with Angels. After this will follow lo&s;s of ap|petite and complexion, check of growth, de|cay of &s;trength, cough, con&s;umption; or el&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="012344_0046_0F88EF59A85754E0">colicks, gripes, worms, fits, &amp;c. di&s;ea&s;es that re|quire all the &s;kill of a good Phy&s;ician; and happy for them, if the utmo&s;t he can employ will re&s;tore them to any degree of la&s;ting health.</P>
<P>THERE is one thing more which I forgot to mention in it's proper place, and therefore I mu&s;t take notice of it here; that is, the degree of exerci&s;e proper for Children. This is of more con&s;equence that all the re&s;t; for without it, all our care in feeding and cloathing will not &s;ucceed to our wi&s;hes: but when by due degrees a Child is brought to bear a good deal of exerci&s;e without fatigue, it is inconceivable how much impropriety and ab&s;urdity in both tho&s;e articles it will endure unhurt. A Child, therefore, &s;hould be pu&s;hed forwards, and taught to walk as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. A healthy Child a year old will be able to walk alone. This we may call the aera of their deliverance; for this great difficulty &s;urmounted, they gene|rally do well, by getting out of the Nur&s;e's hands to &s;hift for them&s;elves. And here I mu&s;t endeavour to correct a great mi&s;take, which is, that mo&s;t people think it wrong to put weakly Children upon their legs, e&s;pecially if they are the lea&s;t bent or crooked; but whoever will
<PB N="48" REF="012344_0047_0F88EF5A67689F80">venture the experiment will &s;urely find, that crooked legs will grow in time &s;trong and &s;traight by frequent walking, while di&s;u&s;e will make them wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day. As they grow daily more and more able, let their walks be gradually increa&s;ed, 'till they can walk two miles on a &s;tretch without wea|rine&s;s; which they will be very well able to do before they are three years old, if they are accu&s;tomed to it every day. To lead them &s;uch a walk &s;hould be impo&s;ed as an indi&s;pen&s;i|ble ta&s;k upon their maids; for to them it will be the highe&s;t plea&s;ure; &s;o far from a burden to them, that if they perform the daily duty, they will, from the impul&s;e of their own active vi|gour, be found running, leaping and playing, all day long. Thus, a dull, heavy Child may be made playful and &s;prightly, a weakly one healthy and &s;trong, and confirmed in good ha|bits and perpetual health.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome other little niceties, that, were they ob&s;erved in the nur&s;ing of Children, would be of &s;ome u&s;e to them, &s;uch as making them lie &s;traight in bed, I do not mean extend|ed like a corp&s;e, but that their limbs may be free and ea&s;y. I have &s;ometimes &s;een Children
<PB N="49" REF="012344_0048_0F88EF5B2A5DF668">a year or two old lie doubled up in bed as in the womb, e&s;pecially in cold weather, and from the con&s;traint of their po&s;ture fall into profu&s;e &s;weats. This will be prevented if they are laid &s;traight, and &s;leep relaxing all the mu&s;cles of the body, the knees will naturally be bent a little. They &s;hould be taught to u&s;e both hands alike; for employing one more than the other, will not only make the hand and arm &s;o u&s;ed, but al&s;o that &s;ide of the body, bigger than the other. This is &s;ometimes the cau&s;e of crookedne&s;s. It would likewi&s;e not be a|mi&s;s to forward their &s;peaking plain, by &s;peak|ing plain di&s;tinct words to them, in&s;tead of the namby-pamby &s;tile, and giving them back their own broken inarticulate attempts; by which means, I believe, &s;ome Children &s;carcely &s;peak intelligibly at &s;even years of age. I think they cannot be made rea&s;onable creatures too &s;oon.</P>
<P>THESE few loo&s;e thoughts on the &s;ubject of nur&s;ing Children, I &s;end you for your private &s;atisfaction, if they be lucky enough to give you any. I have neither time nor patience to think of form and order, or &s;upporting them
<PB N="50" REF="012344_0049_0F88EF5BE99CEC70">by affected demon&s;trations taken from mechan|ical principles and powers. All I have en|deavoured is to be intelligible and u&s;eful; and therefore I have avoided, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all terms of art; together with learned quota|tions, as often produced out of vanity, and to &s;how deep reading, as for the &s;ake of proof. If you think it may be of any u&s;e to publi&s;h this Letter, I am not unwilling it &s;hould appear; if not, do with it what you plea&s;e. I deliver it up as a FOUNDLING, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as you think proper. I &s;hall only add, by way of per&s;ua&s;ive to tho&s;e who may be inclined to make trial of the method I recommend, that I am a Father, and have already practi&s;ed it with the mo&s;t de&s;irable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> IT is now above twenty years &s;ince I wrote the foregoing e&s;&s;ay, and though I have made a few alterations, it was only to explain tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages that contained any apparent dif|ficulty or ob&s;curity; I have never yet found
<PB N="51" REF="012344_0050_0F88EF5E472CBF08">cau&s;e to alter e&s;&s;entially any one opinion deli|vered in it. I have thro' the whole indu&s;triou&s;|ly laboured at the greate&s;t plaine&s;s and &s;impli|city, and yet my meaning has been much mi&s;t|aken. Some have very &s;trangely expected to find in it the general cure of Childrens di&s;ea&s;es, though it be profe&s;&s;edly wrote only to prevent them, by e&s;tabli&s;hing good health; a very dif|ferent thing (whatever people may think) from the cure of di&s;ea&s;es. Sick or weak Child|ren, whether &s;uch by Nature or made &s;uch by bad Nur&s;ing, cannot perhaps be brought im|mediately into the habits here recommended, but mu&s;t fir&s;t be cured of their maladies by a &s;kilful phy&s;ician, who, if he be al&s;o an hone&s;t man, will introduce the&s;e or &s;imilar habits of management, to continue them in health and &s;trength. But in treating their di&s;ea&s;es, as well as in nur&s;ing them I am very &s;ure many capital errors are committed. I object greatly in particular to the frequent u&s;e of antimonial and mercurial medicines; which, tho' they give &s;ometimes a little temporary releif, by di&s;charg|ing crude and phlegmatic humours, killing worms, &amp;c. I am very confident a repeated u&s;e of them breaks the blood, relaxes the fi|bres,
<PB N="52" REF="012344_0051_0F88EF608C3DE558">and is every way de&s;tructive to the con|&s;titution of Children. Pre&s;ent relief &s;eems to be all that is de&s;ired, and therefore all that is intended by medication; the &s;low but per|manent effects of good habits few have patience to expect. Others have neglected e&s;&s;entials, to lay &s;tre&s;s only upon trifles: A Lady of great &s;way among her acquaintance told me not long ago, with an air of reproach, that &s;he had nur&s;ed her Child according to my book, and it died. I a&s;ked, if &s;he had &s;uckled it her&s;elf? No. Had it &s;ucked any other woman? It was dry-nur&s;ed. Then Madam, you cannot impute your misfortune to my advice, for you have taken a methed quite contrary to it, in the mo&s;t capital point. Oh but, according to my direction, it had never worn &s;tockings. Madam, Children may die, though they do or do not wear &s;tockings.</P>
