<Q>The God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;aid, the Rock of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;pake to me; he that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the Fear of God.</Q>

<P>_IF we may judge by the <HI>manner</HI> in which the&s;e words are introdu|ced, there are none in all the bible, applicable to <HI>civil rulers,</HI> in their <HI>publick</HI> capacity, of more &s;olemn importance.</P>
<P>The <HI>la&s;t</HI> words of <HI>good</HI> men are commonly tho't worthy of particular notice; e&s;pecially, if they are <HI>great</HI> as well as <HI>good,</HI> of an elevated <HI>&s;ta|tion</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="005919_0005_102ACD02F7B78108">
as well as <HI>character</HI> in life. This is a con&s;i|deration that adds weight to my text. For it is enrolled among the <HI>la&s;t</HI> words of one of the <HI>be&s;t</HI> and <HI>greate&s;t</HI> men that ever lived. Such was <HI>Da|vid,</HI> 'the man after God's own heart,' who was rai&s;ed up from low life to the regal dignity, and &s;tiled, on that account, 'the anointed of the God of Jacob.'</P>
<P>And was my text nothing more than his own private &s;entiments, formed with due care, upon long ob&s;ervation and experience, it might well de&s;erve the particular attention of all in civil power; e&s;pecially, as he was a man of extraor|dinary knowledge, penetration and wi&s;dom, as well as piety; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;ingularly qualified to make a judgment in an affair of this nature, as he was called into publick &s;ervice from a youth, and had for many years reigned king in <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>But it is not only <HI>David</HI> that here &s;peaks. The words are rather <HI>God's</HI> than his. For they are thus prefaced, <HI>The God of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;aid, the rock of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;pake to me.</HI> 'That <HI>God</HI> who had &s;e|lected the Jews to be his people, and was their <HI>God</HI> &s;o as he was not the God of other nations; the <HI>rock</HI> on whom their political &s;tate was built, and on whom it depended for &s;upport and pro|tection':&mdash;This God <HI>&s;pake unto David,</HI> either by <HI>Samuel,</HI> or <HI>Nathan,</HI> or &s;ome other in&s;pired pro|phet, or him&s;elf immediately from heaven, &s;ay|ing,
<PB N="7" REF="005919_0006_102ACD06A60C43D0">
as in the words I have read to you, <HI>He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.</HI> It is certainly &s;ome momentous truth, highly worthy of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration of civil rulers, that is here delivered, or it would not have been u&s;hered in with &s;o much &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>Some read the words, (agreable eno' to the original, as criticks ob&s;erve) <HI>there</HI> &s;hall <HI>be a ruler over men that</HI> &s;hall <HI>be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God;</HI> and refer them to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as agreeing with other prophecies, which de&s;cribe him as a 'king that &s;hall reign in righteou&s;ne&s;s,' and be of 'quick under&s;tanding in the fear of the Lord:' But if they be allowed to look forward to him that has &s;ince 'come forth out of <HI>Zion,'</HI> they were al&s;o de&s;igned for the in&s;truction and benefit of <HI>Solomon, David'</HI>s &s;on and appointed &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the throne of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> And by analogy they are applicable to civil rulers, in their various &s;tations, in all ages of the world.</P>
<P>In this view I &s;hall now con&s;ider them, under the two following heads obviou&s;ly contained in them.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. There is a certain order among mankind, according to which &s;ome are entru&s;ted with power to rule over others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Tho&s;e who rule over others mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005919_0007_102ACD0829992798">
The whole will then be applied to the occa|&s;ions of the day.</P>
<P>I. I am to &s;ay, in the fir&s;t place, there is a cer|tain order among men, according to which &s;ome are entru&s;ted with power to rule over others. This is evidently &s;uppo&s;ed in the text; and 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, not as a bare fact, but a fact that has taken place conformably to the will of God, and the rea&s;on of things.</P>
<P>This, to be &s;ure, is the truth of the ca&s;e, in it &s;elf con&s;idered. Order and rule in &s;ociety, or, what means the &s;ame thing, civil government, is not a contrivance of arbitrary and tyrannical men, but a regular &s;tate of things, naturally re&s;ulting from the make of man, and his circum&s;tances in the world. Had man abode in innocency, his nature as a <HI>&s;ociable</HI> creature, and his condition as a <HI>dependent</HI> one, would probably have led to &s;ome &s;ort of civil &s;uperiority: As, among the inhabitants of the upper world, there &s;eems to be a difference of <HI>order,</HI> as well as &s;pecies; which the &s;cripture in|timates, by &s;peaking of them in the various &s;tile of <HI>thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, arch|angels</HI> and <HI>angels.</HI> But however it would have been, had man continued in obedience to his ma|ker, government is rendered a matter of nece&s;&s;ity by the introduction of &s;in into the world. Was there no civil rule among men, but every one might do that which was right in his own eyes, with|out re&s;traint from humane laws, there would not
<PB N="9" REF="005919_0008_102ACD09CBE7A350">
be &s;afety any where on the earth. No man would be &s;ecure in the enjoyment, either of his liberty, or property, or life: But every man's hand would be again&s;t his fellow; and mankind mu&s;t live in perpetual danger, from that oppre&s;&s;i|on, rapine and violence, which would make this world rather a hell, than a fit place to dwell hap|pily in.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the human race are therefore &s;uch, by means of &s;in, that 'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary they &s;hould, for their mutual defence and &s;afety, combine together in di&s;tinct &s;ocieties, lodg|ing as much power in the hands of a few, as may be &s;ufficient to re&s;train the irregularities of the re&s;t, and keep them within the bounds of a ju&s;t decorum. Such a &s;uperiority in &s;ome, and infe|riority in others, is perfectly adju&s;ted to the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of mankind.&mdash;Their circum&s;tances re|quire it.&mdash;They could not live, either comfortably or &s;afely without it.</P>
<P>And from hence, &s;trictly and properly &s;peak|ing, does that civil order there is among men take ri&s;e. Nor will it from hence follow, that govern|ment is a mere humane con&s;titution. For as it originates in the rea&s;on of things, 'tis, at the &s;ame time, e&s;&s;entially founded on the will of God. For the voice of rea&s;on is the voice of God: And he as truly &s;peaks to men by the rea&s;on of things, their mutual relations to and dependencies on each other, as if he uttered his voice from the ex|cellent
<PB N="10" REF="005919_0009_102ACCE72F286340">
glory. And in this way, primarily, he declares his will re&s;pecting a civil &s;ubordination among men. The &s;utablene&s;s of order and &s;upe|riority, both to the nature of man, and his cir|cum&s;tances in the world, together with its nece&s;|&s;ary connection, in the nature of things, with his &s;afety and happine&s;s, is &s;uch an indication of the divine plea&s;ure, that there &s;hould be government, as cannot be gain&s;ay'd nor re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Only it mu&s;t be remembred here, a di&s;tinction ought always to be made between government in its <HI>general notion,</HI> and <HI>particular form</HI> and <HI>man|ner of admini&s;tration.</HI> As to the <HI>latter,</HI> it cannot be affirmed, that this or that particular form of government is made nece&s;&s;ary by the will of God and rea&s;on of things. The <HI>mode</HI> of civil rule may in con&s;i&s;tency with the public good, admit of va|riety: And it has, in fact, been various in diffe|rent nations: Nor has it always continued the &s;ame, in the &s;ame nation. And one model of government may be be&s;t for this Community, and another for that; nay, that model which may be be&s;t for the &s;ame community at one time, may not be &s;o at another. So that it &s;eems left to the wi&s;dom of particular communities to de|termine what form of government &s;hall take place among them; and, &s;o long as the general ends of &s;ociety are provided for and &s;ecured, the de|termination may be various, according to the va|rious circum&s;tances, policies, tempers and intere&s;ts of different communities.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005919_0010_102ACD122CBC83C0">
And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the <HI>manner</HI> of ve&s;ting particular per&s;ons with civil power, whe|ther <HI>&s;upreme</HI> or <HI>&s;ubordinate.</HI> This is not &s;o fix'd by the divine will, as that all nations are obliged to one and the &s;ame way of devolving the admi|ni&s;tration of rule. The &s;upreme authority in I&s;rael, 'tis true, from which, of cour&s;e, all &s;ubor|dinate power in that &s;tate was derived, was &s;ettled by God him&s;elf on <HI>David,</HI> and entail'd on his family to de&s;cend in a lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But it does not appear, that this was ever intended to be a rule obligatory on all nations of the earth: Nor have they kept to it; but have varied in their manner of de&s;igning per&s;ons for, and introducing them into, the &s;everal places of civil tru&s;t. And this &s;eems to be a matter alterable in its nature, and proper to be variou&s;ly determined according to the different circum&s;tances of particular nations.</P>
<P>But 'tis quite otherwi&s;e in re&s;pect of govern|ment it&s;elf, in its <HI>general</HI> notion. This is not a matter of meer humane prudence, but of moral nece&s;&s;ity. It does not lie with men to de|termine at plea&s;ure, whether it &s;hall or &s;hall not take place; but, con&s;idering their pre&s;ent weak, expo&s;ed and dependent condition, 'tis unalterably right and ju&s;t there &s;hould be rule and &s;uperiority in &s;ome, and &s;ubjection and inferiority in others: And this therefore is invariably the will of God; his will manife&s;ted by the moral fitne&s;s and rea|&s;on of things.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005919_0011_102ACD13ADB0ABA8">
And the will of God, as di&s;covered in the re|velations of &s;cripture, touching government a|mong men, perfectly coincides with his will <HI>pri|marily</HI> made known, upon the &s;ame head, by the con&s;titution of things: Or rather, 'tis more clearly and fully opened. For <HI>kings,</HI> and <HI>princes,</HI> and <HI>nobles,</HI> and <HI>all the judges of the earth,</HI> are here re|pre&s;ented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</NOTE> as <HI>reigning and ruling by God:</HI> Yea, they are &s;tiled, the <HI>mini&s;ters of God</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13. 4.</NOTE> and <HI>the powers that be</HI> are declared to be <HI>ordained of God</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 1.</NOTE>: And, upon this con&s;ideration, <HI>&s;ubjection to them</HI> is demanded, <HI>for con&s;cience &s;ake</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 5.</NOTE>; and <HI>who&s;oever re|&s;i&s;teth,</HI> is looked upon as <HI>re&s;i&s;ting the ordinance of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 2.</NOTE>. From all which it is apparent, there is no more room to di&s;pute the <HI>divinity</HI> of civil rule upon the foot of <HI>revelation,</HI> than of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>And thus we have &s;een, not only that &s;ome among men have rule over others, but that it is rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, and agreable to the will of God, it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>And 'tis ea&s;y to collect from the whole, the true <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of that power &s;ome are entru&s;ted with over others. It is not merely that they might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from, and &s;et above vulgar peo|ple; much le&s;s that they might live in greater pomp, and be revered as gods on earth; much le&s;s &s;till that they might be in circum&s;tances to oppre&s;s their fellow-creatures, and trample them
<PB N="13" REF="005919_0012_102ACD1570FE4068">
under their feet: But it is for the <HI>general good</HI> of mankind; to keep confu&s;ion and di&s;order out of the world; to guard men's lives; to &s;ecure their rights; to defend their properties and liberties; to make their way to ju&s;tice ea&s;y, and yet effectual, for their protection when innocent, and their re|lief when injuriou&s;ly treated; and, in a word, to maintain peace and good order, and, in general, to promote the public Welfare, in all in&s;tances, &s;o far as they are able. But this leads me to the next head of di&s;cour&s;e, which is what I have principally in view; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>II. Tho&s;e who rule over others mu&s;t be <HI>ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.</HI> Here I &s;hall di&s;tinctly &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. They mu&s;t be <HI>ju&s;t.</HI> They ought to be &s;o in their <HI>private</HI> capacity; maintaining a care to exhibit in their conduct, towards all they are con|cerned with, a fair tran&s;cript of that fundamental law of the religion of Je&s;us, as well as eternal rule of natural ju&s;tice, 'all things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them.' But <HI>private</HI> ju&s;tice, tho' nece&s;&s;ary in all, yet is not the virtue here e&s;pecially intended. The injunc|tion re&s;pects tho&s;e who <HI>rule over men;</HI> and 'tis as <HI>magi&s;trates,</HI> not <HI>private members</HI> of &s;ociety, that they are required to be <HI>ju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And this duty includes in it more than a ne|gation of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis not enough that rulers are not unju&s;t; that they don't betray
<PB N="14" REF="005919_0013_10292A1277F56C98">
the tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in them; that they don't de|fraud the public; that they don't oppre&s;s the &s;ub|ject, whether in a barefac'd manner, or in a more covert way; by downright violence, or under the cloak of law: 'Tis not enough, I &s;ay, that rulers don't, in the&s;e and &s;uch like ways, pervert judgment and ju&s;tice; out, be&s;ides all this, they mu&s;t be <HI>po&s;itively</HI> righteous. Being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of an inward, &s;teady, uniform principle of ju&s;tice, &s;etting them, in a good mea&s;ure, above the in|fluence of private intere&s;t, or party views, they mu&s;t do that which is equal and right, in their various &s;tations, from the king in &s;upreme, to the lowe&s;t in authority under him.</P>
<P>It would carry me too far beyond the hour a&s;&s;igned me, &s;hould I make a di&s;tribution of ru|lers into their &s;everal ranks, and mention the more &s;pecial acts of ju&s;tice re&s;pectively required of them. I &s;hall therefore content my &s;elf with &s;peaking of them chiefly in the collective &s;en&s;e; pointing out, under a few general heads, &s;ome of the more im|portant articles wherein they &s;hould approve them|&s;elves ju&s;t. And they are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1"> They mu&s;t be ju&s;t in the <HI>u&s;e of their power;</HI> confining it within the limits pre&s;cribed in the con&s;titution they are under. Whatever power any are ve&s;ted with, 'tis delegated to them accor|ding to &s;ome civil con&s;titution. And this, &s;o long as it remains the con&s;titution, they are bound in ju&s;tice to conform them&s;elves to: To be &s;ure, they
<PB N="15" REF="005919_0014_10292A7FACC20200">
ought not to act in violation of any of its main and e&s;&s;ential rights. E&s;pecially, is this an impor|tant point of ju&s;tice; where the con&s;titution is branched into &s;everal parts, and the power origi|nally lodged in it, is divided, in certain mea&s;ures, to each part, in order to pre&s;erve, a ballance in the whole. Rulers, in this ca&s;e, in either branch of the government, are bounded by the con&s;titution, and obliged to keep within the proper limits a&s;|&s;igned them; never cla&s;hing in the exerci&s;e of their power, never encroaching upon the rights of each other, in any &s;hape, or under any pretence whatever. They have &s;everally and equally a right to that power which is granted to them in the con&s;titution, and to wre&s;t it out of each other's hands, or to ob&s;truct one another in the regular legal exerci&s;e of it, is evidently unju&s;t. As in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, which devolves the power of the &s;tate, in certain proportions, on <HI>King, Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> they have neither of them a right to in|vade the province of the other, but are required, by the rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, to keep &s;everally within their own boundaries, acting in union a|mong them&s;elves, and con&s;i&s;tency with the con|&s;titution. If the prerogatives of the <HI>King</HI> are &s;acred, &s;o al&s;o are the rights of <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons:</HI> And if it would be unju&s;t in <HI>Lords</HI> or <HI>Commons,</HI> to touch, in any in&s;tance, the prerogative of the <HI>crown;</HI> &s;o would it be in the <HI>crown,</HI> to invade the rights, which are legally &s;ettled in <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons:</HI> In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s is violated: Nor does the <HI>manner</HI> in which it is
<PB N="16" REF="005919_0015_10292A13FB8BD5E0">
done make any e&s;&s;ential difference; for, if one part of the government is really kept from exert|ing it &s;elf, according to the true meaning of the con&s;titution, whether it be done openly, or by &s;ecret craft; by compul&s;ion or corruption, the de|&s;igned ballance is no longer pre&s;erved; and which way &s;oever the &s;cale turns, whether on the &s;ide of <HI>&s;overeignty,</HI> or <HI>popularity,</HI> 'tis forced down by a fal&s;e weight, which, by degrees, will overturn the government, at lea&s;t, according to this parti|cular model.</P>
<P>And the ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame in all <HI>dependent</HI> governments, as in tho&s;e who&s;e power originates in them&s;elves: E&s;pecially, where the derived con|&s;titution, like that of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is divided into &s;everal ruling parts, and di&s;tributes the grant|ed powers and priviledges &s;everally among the&s;e ruling parts, to each their limited portion. The con&s;titution is here evidently the <HI>grand rule</HI> to all cloathed with power, or claiming pri|viledge, in either branch of the government. And 'tis indeed a <HI>fundamental</HI> point of ju&s;tice, that they keep re&s;pectively within the bounds marked out to them in the con&s;titution. Rulers in one branch of the &s;tate &s;hould not a&s;&s;ume the power delega|ted to tho&s;e in another: Nay, &s;o far &s;hould they be from this, that they &s;hould not, in any degree, le&s;&s;en their ju&s;t weight in the government; much le&s;s may they contrive, by an undue application to their hopes or fears, or by working on their ambition, or covetou&s;ne&s;s, or any other corrupt
<PB N="17" REF="005919_0016_10292A824FBB4860">
principle; much le&s;s, I &s;ay, may they contrive to influence them to give up their power, or, what is as bad, to u&s;e it unfaithfully, be&s;ide the intention for which it was committed to them. The&s;e are certainly methods of inju&s;tice; and, if put in practice, will, by a natural cau&s;ality, weak|en, and, by degrees, de&s;troy tho&s;e checks which rulers are mutually de&s;igned to have one upon a|nother; the effect whereof mu&s;t be <HI>tyranny,</HI> or <HI>anarchy,</HI> either of which will be of fatal con&s;e|quence.</P>

Another general in&s;tance wherein rulers &s;hould be ju&s;t, relates to the <HI>laws by which they govern.</HI> [They have an undoubted right to make and execute laws, for the publick good. This is e&s;&s;entially included in the very idea of govern|ment: In&s;omuch, that government, without a right to enact and enforce proper laws, is nothing more than an empty name.</P>
<P>And this right, in whom&s;oever it is ve&s;ted, mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed under the direction of <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> For as there cannot be government without a right of legi&s;lation, &s;o neither can there be this right but in conjunction with righteou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> exerci&s;e of power that di&s;tingui&s;hes <HI>right</HI> from <HI>might; authority</HI> that is to be revered and obeyed, from <HI>violence</HI> and <HI>tyranny,</HI> which are to be dread|ed and deprecated.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="005919_0017_10292A1CF022EBF8">
Tho&s;e therefore to whom it belongs to make, or execute the laws of a government ought, in the&s;e exerci&s;es of their power, to &s;quare their con|duct by that &s;trict ju&s;tice, which will be to them a &s;ure rule of right action.]</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, if they would be ju&s;t, they mu&s;t make no laws but what bear this character. They &s;hould not, when upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of framing and pa&s;&s;ing acts, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;wayed by any wrong bia&s;s, either from &s;elf-will, or &s;elf-intere&s;t; the &s;miles or frowns of men greater than them&s;elves; or the humour of the populace: But &s;hould bring the propo&s;ed laws to a fair and im|partial examination, not only in their reference to the temper, genius and circum&s;tances of the community, but to that ju&s;tice al&s;o which is founded in the nature of things, and the will of the &s;upreme legi&s;lator: And if they &s;hould appear to be incon&s;i&s;tent with this eternal rule of equity, they ought not to countenance them, but &s;hould do what they can to prevent their e&s;tabli&s;hment. And the rather, becau&s;e &s;hould they enact that in|to a &s;tatute, which is unrighteous; e&s;pecially, if it be plainly and gro&s;ly &s;o, they would be charge|able with 'framing mi&s;chief by a law': The guilt whereof would be the more aggravated, as power, in this ca&s;e, would be on the &s;ide of op|pre&s;&s;ion; and, what is as bad, as unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, by this means, would take a dreadful &s;pread thro' the community. For as the laws are the rule for the executive powers in the government, if the&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="005919_0018_10292A859CFE2E20">
are unju&s;t, all that is done con&s;equent upon a re|gard to them, mu&s;t be unju&s;t too. That would be the &s;tate of things which <HI>Solomon</HI> de&s;cribes, when he &s;ays, 'I &s;aw under the &s;un the place of judgment, that wickedne&s;s was there; and the place of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that iniquity was there:' Than which, there cannot be given a more terrible repre&s;entation of the unhappy effect of a di&s;regard to ju&s;tice in the making of laws.</P>
<P>But Rulers, in order to their an&s;wering the character of ju&s;t, mu&s;t not &s;atisfy them&s;elves with making none but righteous laws; but mu&s;t pro|vide al&s;o, &s;o far as may be, a <HI>&s;ufficiency of &s;uch</HI> to re&s;train the &s;ons of wickedne&s;s, men of avaricious minds, and no con&s;ciences, from that rapine and violence, tho&s;e frauds and oppre&s;&s;ions, in their various kinds and degrees, which their lu&s;ts would prompt them to perpetrate, to the damage of &s;o|ciety, and in violation of all that is right and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides which, they &s;hould be particular in their care to guard the important and exten&s;ive article of <HI>commerce;</HI> calculating laws &s;o as that they may have a tendency to oblige every mem|ber of the community, to u&s;e the methods of fair|ne&s;s and hone&s;ty in their dealings with one ano|ther: In order whereto, one of the main things nece&s;&s;ary is, to fix the preci&s;e <HI>weight</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> according to which the&s;e and tho&s;e commodities &s;hall be bought and &s;old; hereby rendring the practice of hone&s;ty ea&s;y and familiar, while, at
<PB N="20" REF="005919_0019_10292A1E74FE0A40">
the &s;ame time, it is made a matter of difficulty, as well as hazard, for this member of the commu|nity to defraud that, by palming on him a le&s;s quantity than he bargain'd, for, and expected to receive.</P>
<P>[A noble example of this expedient to promote ju&s;tice, the &s;cripture pre&s;ents us with, in the hi&s;|tory it gives of the laws by which the <HI>Jews</HI> of old were governed. It was not thought &s;ufficient to prohibit their 'doing unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in mete|yard, or weight, or mea&s;ure;' and to command their having 'ju&s;t ballances and ju&s;t weights, a ju&s;t Ephah and a ju&s;t Hin:' But the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> was fixt by law, according to which all weights and mea&s;ures mu&s;t be regulated; and it was kept in the <HI>&s;anctuary of God.</HI> And &s;o exact was the government in its care to prevent all fraud, that it allowed no "weights, ballances or mea&s;ures to be made of any metal, as of <HI>Iron, Lead, Tin,</HI> (which were obnoxious to ru&s;t, or might be bent or ea&s;ily impaired) but of <HI>Marble, Stone</HI> or <HI>Gla&s;s,</HI> which were le&s;s liable to be abu&s;ed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Bp. <HI>Patrick</HI> on Levit. 19. 36.</NOTE> And officers al&s;o "were appointed in every city to go about into &s;hops, and &s;ee that the ballances and mea&s;ures were ju&s;t, and determine the &s;tated mea|&s;ure of them: And with whom&s;oever they found any weight or mea&s;ure too light or &s;hort, or bal|lance that went awry, they were to be puni&s;hed by the judges."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">So &s;peaks <HI>Mai|monides,</HI> as quoted by <HI>Ain&s;worth</HI> on the above text.</NOTE> This pattern of ju&s;tice has
<PB N="21" REF="005919_0020_10292A87F824B610">
been copied after by all governments acquainted with it; and the more particular their law, have been for the regulation of <HI>weights</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ures,</HI> the better calculated have they been to promote hone&s;ty in private dealing.]</P>
<P>And if ju&s;tice in rulers &s;hould &s;hew it&s;elf by reducing the things that are bought and &s;old to <HI>weight</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> much more ought it to be &s;een in a&s;certaining the <HI>medium of trade,</HI> as near|ly as may be, to &s;ome determinate value. For this, whether it be money, or &s;omething &s;ub&s;ti|tuted to pa&s;s in lieu of it, is <HI>that</HI> for which all things are exchanged in commerce. And if this, which is of &s;uch univer&s;al u&s;e in the affair of traffick, be a thing variable and uncertain, of one value this week, and another the next, 'tis diffi|cult to conceive, how ju&s;tice &s;hould take place between man and man, in their dealings with one another. If the mea&s;ure we call a foot might gradually, in the &s;pace of a few months or years, lengthen into a yard, or &s;horten into an inch; every one &s;ees, it would, if u&s;ed as a mea&s;ure in trade, tend to &s;pread unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in a com|munity, rather than ju&s;tice. So, if the weight we call a pound might gradually, in the like &s;pace, increa&s;e or dimini&s;h one half; 'tis pa&s;t di&s;pute, it would be an occa&s;ion of general ini|quity, rather than a means to promote hone&s;ty. And the ca&s;e is really the &s;ame (however in&s;en|&s;ible we may be of it) with re&s;pect to the <HI>pa&s;&s;ing medium</HI> in a government. If what we call a
<PB N="22" REF="005919_0021_10292A27B7020418">
<HI>&s;hilling,</HI> may, in a gradual way, in the cour&s;e of a few months or years, ri&s;e in <HI>value</HI> &s;o as to be equal to two or three, or &s;ink in proportion; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, but a wide door &s;hould be opened for oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice. An upright man, in this ca&s;e, would find it ex|treamly difficult to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice, or others he might be concerned with in bu&s;ine&s;s. And for tho&s;e of di&s;hone&s;t minds, and no principles of honour or religion, if men of craft and fore&s;ight, they would have it very much in their power to enrich them&s;elves by being unju&s;t to their neigh|bour.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, the ca&s;e may be &s;o circum&s;tan|ced in a government, e&s;pecially if it be a depen|dent one, as that it may be extreamly difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, while they have no money, to keep that which pa&s;&s;es, in the room of it, from varying in it's <HI>real</HI> worth. But it is not very difficult; to be &s;ure, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, to pitch upon &s;ome <HI>certain &s;tandard,</HI> to which the <HI>current medium</HI> may be &s;o related, as that it's true value, at different times, may be nearly a&s;certained: And if this was e&s;tabli&s;hed as the rule in all <HI>pub|lic payments,</HI> as well as <HI>private contracts</HI> and <HI>bar|gains,</HI> it would be no other than what is right. It would certainly tend not only to do every one ju&s;tice, but to put it very much out of the power of men of no probity 'to go beyond and defraud their brother:' Whereas, while the <HI>medium</HI> is connected with no e&s;tabli&s;hed certain &s;tandard,
<PB N="23" REF="005919_0022_10292A897A4E8380">
but continually varies in it's <HI>real</HI> worth, it mu&s;t be, in the natural cour&s;e of things, an occa&s;ion of great inju&s;tice. [Some, on the one hand, under the fair pretence of a rea&s;onable care to &s;ecure them&s;elves, will injure tho&s;e who lie at their mercy, by extorting from them more that is meet. And others, on the other hand, will take the ad|vantage, to pay a ju&s;t debt with one half the true value it was originally contracted for: Nor will the practice of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s be confined to the&s;e and &s;uch like in&s;tances, but unavoidably mingle it&s;elf with men's tran&s;actions in the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of trade, &s;o as to put them upon making a prey of one another; as is too much the ca&s;e among our&s;elves at this day.]</P>
<P>There is yet another thing, belonging to this head, wherein rulers &s;hould approve them&s;elves ju&s;t; and that is, the <HI>execution of the Laws.</HI> [The power of <HI>executing</HI> as well as making laws (as has been hinted) is in&s;eparable from govern|ment. And the demands of ju&s;tice are to be comply'd with, in the one as well as the other. If 'tis ju&s;t that rulers &s;hould make righteous laws, 'tis equally &s;o, when they are made, that they &s;hould take effectual care to enforce a proper re|gard to them. Of what &s;ervice would laws be, though ever &s;o wi&s;ely calculated to promote the public good, if offenders again&s;t them &s;hould be connived at, or &s;uffered, by one means or another, to go unpuni&s;hed? And what might rea&s;onably be expected in con&s;equence of &s;uch a breach of
<PB N="24" REF="005919_0023_10292A29A14B0688">
tru&s;t, but that the be&s;t laws, together with the authority that enacted them, &s;hould be held in contempt?&mdash;There is no &s;uch thing as &s;upporting the honour of government, or &s;ecuring the good ends propo&s;ed by the laws it e&s;tabli&s;hes, but by un&s;heathing the &s;word, in a faithful and impartial execution of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But here, that we may &s;peak clearly, it may be proper to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>tho&s;e rulers</HI> to whom it belongs to <HI>appoint</HI> and <HI>authori&s;e per&s;ons to execute the laws,</HI> and tho&s;e who are <HI>ve&s;ted with authority for this purpo&s;e.</HI> For the duty which ju&s;tice requires is different, according to the na|ture of that power, wherewith the&s;e different ru|lers are betru&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is certainly a point of ju&s;tice, in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to <HI>empower others to execute the laws,</HI> to &s;elect out of the community &s;uch as are well qualified for &s;o important a tru&s;t. Every man is not fit to have the &s;word of ju&s;tice put into his hands. And the main thing to be lookt at, in the choice of per&s;ons for this &s;ervice, is their <HI>&s;uitablene&s;s</HI> to it. <HI>Meerly</HI> their being men of birth and fortune, is not a &s;ufficient recommenda|tion: Nor, if they are eagerly forward in &s;eeking for a po&s;t of honour or profit, is it a certain indi|cation, that they are fit to be put into it: Neither, if they &s;hould offer money to purcha&s;e it, ought they, on this account, to be preferred to men of greater merit: Much le&s;s ought it to be looked
<PB N="25" REF="005919_0024_10292A8C2ABA2410">
upon as a turning argument in their favour, that they are fit in&s;truments to &s;erve the &s;ecret de|&s;igns of tho&s;e in &s;uperior &s;tation.

<P>The advice which <HI>Jethro</HI> gave <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is here proper, 'Thou &s;halt provide out of all the peo|ple able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 18. 21.</NOTE> The&s;e are the men, men of under&s;tanding, courage and re&s;olution; men of integrity, fidelity and hone&s;ty; men of piety and &s;ub&s;tantial religion; men of a noble genero&s;ity, &s;etting them above the temptations, which tho&s;e of narrow minds and &s;elfi&s;h views, are ea&s;ily drawn away by and enticed: The&s;e, I &s;ay, are the pro|per men to fill the various po&s;ts in the &s;tate.

<P>Not that tho&s;e, with whom it lies to appoint officers, are always to blame, when unqualified per&s;ons are put into places of tru&s;t; for they are liable, after all prudent caution, to be mi&s;taken in their own judgment, and to be impo&s;ed on by mi&s;information from others.

&s;ame to <HI>magi&s;trates,</HI> as to men in a private life. They mu&s;t pay that which they owe, according to the true meaning of their engagements, with|out fraud or delay.</P>
<P>[They may al&s;o be in debt for &s;ervices done by labourers, in this and the other &s;ecular employ|ment. And here the rule of ju&s;tice is that, 'withold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.

<P>[To be &s;ure, where their &s;tipends have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, or, at lea&s;t, they have had rea&s;onable encouragement to expect &s;uch a certain acknow|ledgment for their &s;ervice, righteou&s;ne&s;s requires that it be paid them: Nor may it be tho't that the <HI>&s;ame nominal &s;um,</HI> falling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;tly below the <HI>real worth</HI> of the debt, will be &s;ufficient to di&s;|charge it.

<P>And the ca&s;e, in point of equity, is really the &s;ame, where a government has come into no &s;pecial agreement; but the a&s;certaining the <HI>quan|tum</HI> proper for the &s;upport of it's officers, is left to it's own wi&s;dom and probity. For an allow|ance

is due to them by the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s: And it ought to be granted, both in proper &s;ea|&s;on, and full proportion, that there may be no rea|&s;on for complaint, either of <HI>penurious</HI> or <HI>unju&s;t</HI> dealing.</P>
<P>I may add here, the <HI>di&s;tribution of rewards,</HI> in ca&s;e of extraordinary &s;ervice done for a govern|ment, falls properly under this head of ju&s;tice.

And it is to be hoped, this go|vernment will never be backward, according to their ability, &s;uitably to reward tho&s;e who have &s;ignalized them&s;elves, in doing &s;ervice for their king and country.]</P>
<P N="4">4. Another general in&s;tance wherein rulers &s;hould be ju&s;t, concerns the <HI>liberties</HI> and <HI>privi|ledges</HI> of the <HI>&s;ubject.</HI> In all governments there is a re&s;erve of certain rights in favour of the people: In &s;ome, they are few in kind, and &s;mall in de|gree: In others, they are both great and nume|rous; rendring the people &s;ignally happy who&s;e lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is to be favoured with the undi&s;turbed en|joyment of them. And it would be no wonder, if they &s;hould keep a jealous eye over them, and think no co&s;t too much to be expended, for the defence and &s;ecurity of them: E&s;pecially, if they
<PB N="33" REF="005919_0032_10292A96629706B8">
were the purcha&s;e of wi&s;e and pious ance&s;tors, who &s;ubmitted to difficulties, endured hard&s;hips, &s;pent their e&s;tates, and ventured their lives, that they might tran&s;mit them as an inheritance to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>And &s;hall &s;uch valuable, dear-bought rights be neglected, or invaded by the rulers of a people? 'Tis a principal part of that ju&s;tice which is eter|nally expected of them, as they would not gro&s;ly pervert one of the main ends of their office, to pre&s;erve and perpetuate to every member of the community, &s;o far as may be, the full enjoyment of their liberties and priviledges, whether of a <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>religious</HI> nature.</P>
<P>Here I may &s;ay di&s;tinctly,</P>
<P>As rulers would be ju&s;t, they mu&s;t take all proper care to pre&s;erve entire the <HI>civil</HI> rights of a people. And the ways in which they &s;hould expre&s;s this care are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>They &s;hould do it by appearing in <HI>defence</HI> of their liberties, if called in que&s;tion, and making u&s;e of all wi&s;e and &s;utable methods to prevent the lo&s;s of them: Nor can they be too active, dili|gent or laborious in their endeavours upon this head: Provided always, the priviledges in dan|ger are worth contending for, and &s;uch as the people have a ju&s;t right and legal claim to. O|therwi&s;e, there may be hazard of lo&s;ing <HI>real</HI> li|berties, in the &s;trife for tho&s;e that are <HI>imaginary;</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="005919_0033_10292A5530794958">
or <HI>valuable</HI> ones, for &s;uch as are of trifling con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>They &s;hould al&s;o expre&s;s this care, by &s;ea&s;on|ably and faithfully placing a proper guard again&s;t the de&s;igns of tho&s;e, who would rule in a <HI>di&s;po|tic</HI> manner, to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the rights natu|rally or legally ve&s;ted in the people. And here 'tis a great mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e, there can be dan|ger only from tho&s;e in the highe&s;t &s;tation. There may, 'tis true, be danger from this quarter: And it has &s;ometimes proved &s;o in fact: An unhappy in&s;tance whereof was &s;een in the <HI>arbitrary</HI> reign of king JAMES the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> in <HI>per&s;on</HI> at <HI>home,</HI> and by his <HI>repre&s;entative here;</HI> as a check to which, tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the guardian&s;hip of the na|tion's rights were &s;pirited to take &s;uch mea&s;ures, as i&s;&s;ued in that <HI>revolution,</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> on which his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's claim to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> throne is dependent. May the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> be continued in his royal hou&s;e for|ever! And may the &s;ame &s;pirit, which &s;ettled it there, prevail in the rulers of the Engli&s;h nation, &s;o long as the &s;un and moon &s;hall endure!</P>
<P>But, as I &s;aid, a people's liberties may be in danger from others, be&s;ides tho&s;e in the highe&s;t rank of government. The men who &s;trike in with the <HI>popular</HI> cry of <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>priviledge,</HI> working them&s;elves, by an artful application to the fears and jealou&s;ies of the people, into their good opinion of them as lovers of their country,
<PB N="35" REF="005919_0034_10292A98DB192240">
if not the only &s;tanch friends to it's intere&s;ts, may, all the while, be only aiming at power to carry every thing according to their own &s;overeign plea&s;ure: And they are, in this ca&s;e, mo&s;t dange|rous enemies to the community; and may, by degrees, if not narrowly watched, arrive to &s;uch an height, as to be able to &s;erve their own ends, by touching even the people in their mo&s;t valua|ble rights. And the&s;e commonly are the men, thro' who&s;e influence, either as primary mana|gers, or tools to others, they &s;uffer mo&s;t in their real liberties.</P>
<P>In fine, they &s;hould expre&s;s this care in a con|&s;tant readine&s;s to bear due te&s;timony again&s;t even the &s;maller encroachments upon the liberty of the &s;ubject, whether by private men's invading one another's rights, or by the tyranny of inferiour officers, who may treat tho&s;e under their power, as tho' they had no <HI>natural</HI> rights, not to &s;ay a ju&s;t claim to the invaluable priviledges of <HI>Engli&s;h|men.</HI></P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Romans</HI> have &s;et an illu&s;trious ex|ample in this kind. Such was the provi&s;ion they made to &s;ecure the people's priviledges, that it was dangerous for any man, tho' in <HI>office,</HI> to act towards the meane&s;t <HI>freeman</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> in violation of the meane&s;t of them. Hence the <HI>magi&s;trates</HI> who ordered <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> to be <HI>beaten uncon|demned, feared when they heard they were</HI> ROMANS. And <HI>Ly&s;ias, the chief captain,</HI> was filled with the
<PB N="36" REF="005919_0035_10292A56B46D0D10">
like <HI>fear</HI> for commanding, that <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hould be <HI>examined with &s;courging;</HI> when he under&s;tood, that he was <HI>born a freeman</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> And it would have a good tendency to &s;ecure to the people the enjoyment of their liberties, if the&s;e &s;maller in&s;tances of illegal power were carefully and &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed.</P>
<P>But ju&s;tice in rulers &s;hould be &s;een likewi&s;e in their care of the <HI>religious</HI> rights and liberties of a people. Not that they are to exert their autho|rity in <HI>&s;ettling articles of faith,</HI> or <HI>impo&s;ing modes of wor&s;hip,</HI> &s;o as that all mu&s;t frame their <HI>belief,</HI> and order their <HI>practice,</HI> according to their deci|&s;ions, or lie expo&s;ed to <HI>penalties</HI> of one kind or a|nother. This would be to put men under re|&s;traint, as to the exerci&s;e of their religious rights: Nor are <HI>penal laws</HI> at all adju&s;ted in their nature, to enlighten men's minds, or convince their judg|ment. This can be done only by <HI>good rea&s;on:</HI> And this therefore is the only proper way of ap|plying to rea&s;onable creatures.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice in rulers &s;hould therefore put them upon leaving every member of the community, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, freely to choo&s;e his own religion, and profe&s;s and practice it according to that <HI>external form,</HI> which he apprehends will be mo&s;t acceptable to his maker: Provided, his religion is &s;uch as may con&s;i&s;t with the public &s;afe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y: Otherwi&s;e, it would be neither wi&s;dom nor ju&s;tice in the government to <HI>tolerate</HI> it.</P>

Nor is this all; but they &s;hould guard every man from all in&s;ult and abu&s;e on account of his religious &s;entiments, and from all mole&s;tation and di&s;turbance, while he endeavours the propagation of them, &s;o far as he keeps within the bounds of decency, and approves him&s;elf a peaceable mem|ber of &s;ociety.</P>

This la&s;t in&s;tance of the care of rulers, I the rather mention, becau&s;e it falls in &s;o exactly with the circum&s;tances of the pa&s;tors of the churches in this <HI>province.</HI> There is not, I believe, an or|der of men, in the land, more univer&s;ally, or to a greater degree, injured and oppre&s;&s;ed in regard of their ju&s;t dues.

the judge of the world, for the u&s;e of that power he has put into their hands.

make them ruler over many'; placing them at his own right hand, in his kingdom.</P>
<P>II. I now proceed to &s;ay, in the &s;econd place, Tho&s;e who rule over men, mu&s;t <HI>rule in the fear of God.</HI></P>
<P>The fear of God, being not only in it&s;elf a con|&s;iderable part of religion, but al&s;o a grace that has a &s;pecial influence on all the other parts of it, is commonly, and not unfitly, u&s;ed in &s;cripture to &s;ignify the whole of it. This &s;eems to be the meaning of the phra&s;e here: And the thing in|tended is, not only that rulers &s;hould be endowed with an inward principle of religion, but that they &s;hould exerci&s;e their authority, in their whole admini&s;tration, under the influence of &s;o good and powerful a di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>He that ruleth over men, mu&s;t rule in the fear of God.</HI> As if the royal prophet had &s;aid, 'It is nece&s;&s;ary, civil rulers &s;hould have upon their minds a becoming &s;en&s;e of God and religion: And it &s;hould govern their public conduct. Whatever they do, in their &s;everal &s;tations, &s;hould be done under the guidance of an habitual awe of God, a &s;erious regard to his governing will, and their ac|countablene&s;s to him. This is the principle that &s;hould have a predominating &s;way in all exert|ments of them&s;elves in their public capacity'. This I take to be the true &s;en&s;e of the words.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="005919_0049_10292A7D54C27018">
To be &s;ure, 'tis the truth of the thing. Civil rulers ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a principle of reli|gion, and to act under the direction of it in their re&s;pective &s;tations. This is a matter of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> I don't mean that it is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their having a <HI>right</HI> to rule over men. <HI>Dominion is not founded in grace:</HI> Nor is every pious good man fit to be entru&s;ted with civil power.&mdash;'Tis ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h between government in it's <HI>ab&s;tracted notion,</HI> and the <HI>faithful advantageous admini&s;tration</HI> of it. And religion in rulers is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the <HI>latter,</HI> tho' not to the former.</P>
<P>Not but that they may be con&s;iderably u&s;eful in their places, if the religious fear of God does not reign in their hearts. From a natural bene|volence of temper, accompanied with an active hone&s;t turn of mind, they may be in&s;trumental in doing good &s;ervice to the public: Nay, they may be prompted, even from a view to them&s;elves, their own honour and intere&s;t, to behave well in the po&s;ts they &s;u&s;tain, at lea&s;t, in many in&s;tances. But if de&s;titute of religion, they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no principle that will &s;timulate a care in them to act up to their character <HI>&s;teadily</HI> and <HI>univer&s;ally,</HI> and &s;o as fully to an&s;wer the ends of their in&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>'Tis a principle of religion, and this only, that can &s;et them free from the unhappy influence of tho&s;e <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>lu&s;ts,</HI> which they are &s;ubject to, in common with other men, and by means
<PB N="51" REF="005919_0050_10292AD6E5513900">
whereof they may be betrayed into that tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, that violence and inju&s;tice, which will de&s;troy the peace and good order of &s;ociety. The&s;e, 'tis true, may be under &s;ome tolerable check from other principles, at lea&s;t, for a while, and in re&s;pect of tho&s;e actings that are plainly enormous. But no re&s;traints are like tho&s;e, which the true fear of God lays upon men's lu&s;ts. This habitually prevailing in the hearts of rulers, will happily prevent the out-breaking of their pride, and envy, and avarice, and &s;elf-love, and other lu&s;ts, to the damage of &s;ociety; and not only &s;o, but it will weaken, and gradually de&s;troy, the very inward propen&s;ities them&s;elves to the various acts of vice. It naturally, and powerfully, tends to this: And this is the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ct it will produce, in a le&s;s or greater degree, according to the &s;trength of the religious principle, in tho&s;e who are the &s;ubjects of it.</P>
<P>And a principle of religion al&s;o, and this only, will be effectual to excite rulers to a uniform, con&s;tant and univer&s;al regard to truth and ju&s;tice, in their public conduct. Inferiour principles may influence them in particular ca&s;es, and at certain &s;ea&s;ons: But the fear of God only will prompt them to <HI>every in&s;tance</HI> of right action, and <HI>at all times.</HI> This will po&s;&s;e&s;s them of &s;uch &s;entiments, give &s;uch a direction to their views, and fix &s;uch a happy bia&s;s on their minds, as that their chief concern and care will be, to behave in their offices &s;o as to an&s;wer the good ends for
<PB N="52" REF="005919_0051_10292AAA8F5A4088">
which they were put into them. In one word, They will now be the &s;ubjects of that <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al</HI> principle of good conduct, which may, un|der God, be depended on, to carry them thro' the whole of their duty, upon all occa&s;ions, un|der all difficulties, and in oppo&s;ition to all temp|tations, to the rendring the people, over whom they bear rule, as happy as 'tis in their power to make them.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, without a principle of religion, none of their &s;ervices for the public will meet with the divine approbation. 'Tis therefore, in re&s;pect of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> a matter of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that they be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the true fear of God. It won't &s;uffice, &s;hould they behave well in their places, if they have no higher view herein than their own private intere&s;t; if they are influenced, not from a due regard to God, his honour and authority, but from love to them&s;elves. This will &s;poil their be&s;t &s;ervices, in point of the divine ac|ceptance: Whereas, if they act from a principle of religion, what they do in a way of &s;erving their generation will be kindly taken at the hands of a merciful God, and he will, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, amply reward them for it, in the great day of retribution.]</P>

<P>Religion is not in &s;uch a flouri&s;hing &s;tate, at this day, but that it needs the countenance of your example, and the interpo&s;ition of your au|thority, to keep it from in&s;ult and contempt.

<P>We are thankful for the good and whole&s;ome laws which have been made, from time to time, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice, in it's various kinds; and, in particular, for the re&s;traint that has been laid upon tho&s;e, who may be inclined to exce&s;&s;ive drinking. Alas! that &s;uch multitudes, notwith|&s;tanding, are overtaken with this fault. Hard drinking is indeed become common all over the land. And 'tis a&s;toni&s;hing to think what quan|tities of &s;trong drink are con&s;umed among us! Unle&s;s &s;ome, well capable of forming a judgment, are very much mi&s;taken, more a great deal is needle&s;&s;ly and viciou&s;ly con&s;umed than would &s;uffice to an&s;wer the whole charge, both of church and &s;tate. A reproach this, to any peo|ple! And if &s;omething further is not done by the government, to prevent the u&s;e that is made of &s;trong drink, it will, in a little time, prove the de&s;truction of the country, in the natural cour&s;e of things; if God &s;hould not po&s;itively te&s;tify his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t &s;uch horrid intemperance. It may de&s;erve your con&s;ideration, my <HI>Fathers,</HI>

whether one occa&s;ion of this &s;candalous con&s;ump|tion of &s;trong drink, has not been the needle&s;s multiplication of <HI>taverns,</HI> as well as more <HI>private licen&s;ed hou&s;es,</HI> that are too commonly u&s;ed for <HI>tip|ling,</HI> and &s;erve to little purpo&s;e, but to tempt people, in low life, &s;infully to wa&s;te their time, and &s;pend their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>[It would al&s;o redound much to the advan|tage of the province, if our <HI>civil Fathers</HI> could contrive &s;ome way or other, that might be effec|tual to prevent people's laying out &s;o much of the fruit of their labour, in that which is <HI>needle&s;s</HI> and <HI>extravagant.</HI> It will not be denied, by any capable of making ob&s;ervation, that the <HI>exce&s;&s;es,</HI> all ranks of per&s;ons have unhappily run into, need correction.

<P>But there is nothing more needs your awaken'd attention, my honoured <HI>Fathers</HI> in the govern|ment, than the unhappy &s;tate of this people by means of the <HI>current medium.</HI> Whatever wi&s;e and good ends might be propo&s;ed at fir&s;t, and from time to time, in the <HI>emi&s;&s;ion of bills of cre|dit,</HI> they have proved, in the event, a cruel en|gine

of oppre&s;&s;ion. It may be, there was &s;carce ever a province under more melancholly circum|&s;tances, by rea&s;on of inju&s;tice, which is become almo&s;t unavoidable. Sad is the ca&s;e of your men of <HI>nominal &s;alaries:</HI> And much to be pitied al&s;o are tho&s;e <HI>widows</HI> and <HI>orphans,</HI> who depend on the loan of their money for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: While yet, the&s;e la&s;t, of all per&s;ons in the community, &s;hould be mo&s;t carefully guarded again&s;t every thing that looks like oppre&s;&s;ion. This &s;in, when <HI>widows</HI> and <HI>fatherle&s;s children</HI> are the per&s;ons wronged by it, is heinou&s;ly aggravated in the &s;ight of a righteous God; as may ea&s;ily be collected from that emphatical prohibition, &s;o often repeated in all parts of the bible, 'Thou &s;halt not oppre&s;s the widow, nor the fatherle&s;s'. But the oppre&s;&s;ion reigning in the land, is not confined to this order or that condition of per&s;ons, but touches all with|out exception. None e&s;cape its pernicious in|fluence, neither high nor low, rich nor poor. Like an over-bearing flood, it makes its way thro' the province; and all are &s;ufferers by it, in a le&s;s or greater degree, and feel and own them&s;elves to be &s;o.</P>
<P>And will you, our honoured rulers, by any po&s;itive acts, or faulty neglects, &s;uffer your &s;elves to be in&s;trumental in the continuance of &s;uch a &s;tate of things? God forbid! We don't think you would <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> do any thing to countenance oppre&s;&s;ion, or neglect any thing that might have a tendency to remove it out of the land.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="005919_0063_10292ABA780114F8">
Neither can we think, that any former a&s;&s;em|blies have <HI>knowingly</HI> acted, in the <HI>emi&s;&s;ion of pub|lic bills,</HI> upon di&s;hone&s;t principles: Tho' it may be feared, whether the righteous God, in holy di&s;plea&s;ure at the &s;ins both of <HI>rulers</HI> and <HI>people,</HI> may not have witheld coun&s;el from our wi&s;e men, and &s;cattered darkne&s;s in their paths: And if, in con&s;equence hereof, there has been di&s;union in the &s;entiments of our <HI>civil Fathers,</HI> concerning the <HI>public medium,</HI> and un&s;teadine&s;s in their con|duct, 'tis no matter of wonder: Nor, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, is it hard to be accounted for, that inju&s;tice, by means of the <HI>paper currency,</HI> &s;hould have taken &s;uch a general and dreadful &s;pread, thro' the land.</P>
<P>But, by what means &s;oever we became invol|ved in the&s;e perplexities, 'tis certainly high time to make a pau&s;e, and con&s;ider what may be done that will be effectual towards the recovering and maintaining ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty, that we may be called the <HI>city of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the faithful city.</HI></P>
<P>It would be culpable vanity in me, to attempt to pre&s;cribe to our honourable legi&s;lature; yet may I, without going beyond my line, after the example of the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, <HI>rea|&s;on</HI> with you <HI>of public righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and its con|nection with <HI>a judgment to come.</HI></P>

<P>Let me be&s;eech you, <HI>Sirs,</HI> for the &s;ake of this poor people, and for the &s;ake of your own &s;ouls, when you &s;hall &s;tand before the dreadful bar of the eternal judgment, to lay a&s;ide all party de|&s;igns and private con&s;iderations, and to delibe|rate upon this great affair, with a &s;ingle view to the public good, and under the uniform influ|ence

<P>If there needs any excu&s;e for my wonted plaine&s;s of &s;peech, I can only &s;ay;&mdash;my con&s;cience beareth me witne&s;s, that what I have &s;aid has proceeded, not from want of a decent re&s;pect for tho&s;e who are my <HI>civil Fathers,</HI> but from faith|fulne&s;s to God, who&s;e I am, and whom I de&s;ire to &s;erve, as well as from an ardent love to my dear country, which I am grieved to behold in tears, by rea&s;on of 'the oppre&s;&s;ions that are done under the &s;un'.</P>

<P>And let your religion now di&s;cover it&s;elf in all proper ways; particularly, in doing your duty to tho&s;e, whom it hath plea&s;ed God to entru&s;t with power to rule over you.</P>
<P>Be exhorted to 'make &s;upplications, prayers and interce&s;&s;ions, with giving of thanks, for the King in &s;upreme, and for all in authority' under him, that by means of their wi&s;e, and gentle, and ju&s;t admini&s;trations in Government, we may 'lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and ho|ne&s;ty'.</P>
<P>And as &s;ubjection to civil rulers is &s;o peremp|torily demanded of you, by the laws of our holy religion, that you can't be good chri&s;tians with|out it, let me caution you, on the one hand, not to 'de&s;pi&s;e dominion', nor '&s;peak evil of dig|nities': And, on the other, let me 'put you in mind to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, and to obey magi&s;trates; &s;ubmitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake: Whether it be to the king, as &s;upreme; or unto gover|nours, as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the

<P>And as rulers are the mini&s;ters of God, his authoris'd deputies, for the people's good, and continually, &s;o far as they an&s;wer the ends of their in&s;titution, attend on this very thing: 'For this cau&s;e pay you tribute al&s;o': And do it, not grudgingly, but with a chearful mind, in obedi|ence to that glorious &s;overeign Being, who has &s;aid, 'render unto <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the things that are <HI>Cae&s;ar'</HI>s'.</P>
<P>In fine, Let me call upon you to 'render un|to all their dues'. Abhor the little arts of fraud and deceit that are become &s;o common, in this day of growing di&s;hone&s;ty. Make u&s;e of <HI>con|&s;cience</HI> in your dealings with your neighbour; and be fair and equitable, wherein you may have to do with him in a way of commerce.

<P>_TO fill up a vacant page or two, I &s;hall in&s;ert a few pa&s;&s;ages, which were delivered, &s;ome years &s;ince, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the audience of the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>general Court.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t is taken from the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Barnard'</HI>s Elec|tion-Sermon; where, &s;peaking of the <HI>medium of our trade,</HI> he &s;ays, (pag. 29, 30.) <Q>It was the po&s;itive law of God, (yet in it &s;elf a moral precept;) (Lev. xix. 35, 36.) <HI>Ye &s;hall do no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in judgment, in mete-yard, in weight; in mea&s;ure: ju&s;t ballances, ju&s;t weights, and a ju&s;t ephah, and a ju&s;t hin, &s;hall ye have.</HI> And &s;o may context &s;ays, the <HI>ju&s;t weight, and ballance, are the Lord's.</HI> They are what God &s;trictly requires. They are his weight, and mea&s;ure, and not to be altered by man, at plea&s;ure. And if the weight, and mea&s;ure, by which men deal out to their neighbours, mu&s;t be ju&s;t, certain, and invariable, much more ought that to be &s;o which is the &s;tandard of all others, and the only &s;ure rule by which to proportion the value of every thing; which it cannot be, while it is left to every man's di&s;cretion, ju&s;tice or probity, to lengthen, or &s;horten, to widen, or contract, to add to, or take from, it, as may be&s;t &s;uit with his particular occa&s;ions. 'Till a Government have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the ballance even, and the weight, meteyard, ephah, and hin, of &s;uch a certain &s;ize, that every man may know what certain rule to go by, in dealing with his neighbour, it will be left to each per&s;on to act as he plea&s;es; and when every man is left at &s;uch a lawle&s;s liberty, it will not be to be wondered at, if &s;ome that can't help it, are forced to accept of the one half of the weight and mea&s;ure that others can demand; or if what was but an ounce a while ago be grown up to a pound anon, and the nail &s;tretches it &s;elf to a yard; I mean the variations of all mea&s;ure will be without bounds, becau&s;e the medium that proves them is it &s;elf variable; and there will as certainly be a pro|gre&s;&s;ion in the variation, in the dimini&s;hing hand, let the quantity of the medium be more or le&s;s, as that there are men that buy, and &s;ell, and hope to get gain. What the con&s;equents of this mu&s;t be to a people, needs no great fore&s;ight to determine. And where the fault of all the
<PB REF="005919_0070_10292AF2D55351F0">
confu&s;ion brought upon &s;uch a people, will at la&s;t be found to lie (tho' it might have taken it's ri&s;e from humane frailty, and mi&s;take, but becomes greatly aggravated by the continuance of the error after the di&s;covery of it,) every one may plainly &s;ee.</Q></P>
<P>The other are borrowed from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Appleton'</HI>s Ser|mon upon the like occa&s;ion, in which it is &s;aid, (pag. 37, 38.) <Q>Many of our rulers have from the beginning been men of ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom, that have had the knowledge and the principle; but there is rea&s;on to fear this has not been the ca&s;e of all.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is to be feared, that &s;ome former a&s;&s;emblies have not in all re&s;pects govern'd them&s;elves by tho&s;e precepts and principles; if they had, I cannot think we &s;hould have been &s;o involved, as now we are. <HI>GOD forbid, that I &s;hould be guilty of ra&s;h judging.</HI> But who can think, if there had been nothing of a party-&s;pirit, or of a &s;pirit of pride and oppo&s;ition, nothing of a &s;elfi&s;h and a contracted &s;pirit, that the Province would have been &s;o perplexed, as that now it &s;eems to be beyond any common &s;kill to extricate it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That <HI>hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy</HI> is as true as it is a common &s;aying, and is abundantly &s;upported by the oracles of truth: <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the upright &s;hall deliver them, but tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall be taken in their own naughtine&s;s,</HI> Prov. 11. 6. The righteous Lord, I fear, has been provoked with the corruptions that he has &s;een in our general Courts, and &s;o has withheld wi&s;dom from the wi&s;e, and &s;cattered darkne&s;s in their paths, and left many marks of his di&s;plea&s;ure upon us. The un&s;teady conduct about our <HI>medium</HI> &s;hews, that there has wanted not only wi&s;dom, but truth and ju&s;tice. For if there had been that uprightne&s;s, and &s;uch a di&s;inte|re&s;ted regard to the public good as there &s;hould have been; I can't think that things would have come to this unhappy pa&s;s. The integrity of the upright would have guided them into better mea&s;ures, than to &s;end forth a medium with &s;uch a <HI>depreciating tendency</HI> in it; that in&s;tead of it's being a fixed &s;teady medium of commutative ju&s;tice, it has been, for many years, the grand medium of inju&s;tice among us, and rendred ju&s;tice between man and man almo&s;t impracti|cable.</Q></P>
