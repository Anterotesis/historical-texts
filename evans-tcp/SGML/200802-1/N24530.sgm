</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS declaration of the apo&s;tle, directed to chri&s;tians, and de&s;igned, to in&s;truct and caution them, while under the government of heathen rulers, may, it is pre&s;umed, without impropriety, be recommended to the con&s;ideration both of rulers and ruled, now that chri&s;tianity is their common religion. As the circum|&s;tance no longer exi&s;ts, which directed the ob&s;ervations and coun&s;els of the apo&s;tles, relative to civil govern|ment, principally to &s;ubjects and their duties; and as being mi&s;repre&s;ented by ignorance, and &s;landered by folly are evils to which &s;ubjects are by no means ex|po&s;ed alone, may I not well be ju&s;tified in giving to the text &s;uch a latitude of application, as has been &s;ug|ge&s;ted?</P>
<P>A VIEW of the words in their connexion, may lead to &s;ome previous ob&s;ervations on the ORIGIN and DE|SIGN of CIVIL GOVERNMENT, and the a&s;pect of CHRIS|TIANITY upon it.</P>
<P><PB REF="032462_0005_0FF2745D9413DCB0">"SUBMIT your&s;elves, &s;aith the apo&s;tle, to every or|dinance of man, for the LORD'S &s;ake: whether it be to the king as &s;upreme; or unto governours, as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well. For &s;o is the will of GOD, that with well doing ye may put to &s;ilence the ignorance of fooli&s;h men."</P>
<P>IT is of little importance whether we allow, to the fir&s;t quoted words, the con&s;truction which our tran&s;la|tion gives them, or, with &s;ome learned divines, in&s;tead of <HI>every ordinance of man,</HI> read <HI>every human creature</HI>; that is, every per&s;on in authority; civil rulers of every rank and de&s;cription. If civil government be con&s;ider|ed by this apo&s;tle, as an ordinance of man, he does not in thus repre&s;enting it, contradict another apo&s;tle, who &s;ays, "the powers that be are ordained of GOD." HE has ordained them, becau&s;e they are agreeable to the con&s;titution of the world, which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed. It is evidently his will that civil government &s;hould exi&s;t, becau&s;e he is a GOD of order and not of confu|&s;ion; becau&s;e the nature of mankind, their &s;ocial di&s;po|&s;ition, their wants, their pa&s;&s;ions, their irregularities and their vices clearly indicate its expediency and impor|tance. We are by no means obliged to conclude, from a command, to be in &s;ubjection to the exi&s;ting powers, <HI>becau&s;e they are ordained of</HI> GOD: or to &s;ubmit to eve|ry per&s;on in civil authority, of whatever name, rank or degree of power, <HI>for the</HI> LORD'S <HI>&s;ake,</HI> that all rulers de|rive their authority immediately from GOD. We may not infer that he has &s;o pointed out the particular man|ner in which we &s;hould be governed, or the degree of power which every ruler ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s, that civil gov|ernment,
<PB REF="032462_0006_0FF274624B7015D8">may not be properly &s;tyled <HI>an ordinance of man.</HI></P>
<P>GOVERNMENT has its remote origin in the nature of mankind: Or, the ruler's power is indirectly derived from HIM who is the author of that nature. Its imme|diate origin, as relative to particular nations and com|munities of men, has been far from uniform. The only proper &s;ource of the ruler's power, at lea&s;t, when extend|ed farther than that of a parent over his family, is, un|der GOD, the people or community, who are the &s;ub|jects of his government. We believe that the people only have the right to determine the nature and form of their political con&s;titution. But we readily allow that facts are, in many in&s;tances, at variance with right; and that the theory which &s;uppo&s;es the obligation to civil obedience derived from an original &s;ocial com|pact, is not univer&s;ally, or in general, &s;upported by the hi&s;tory of nations. Many, if not mo&s;t of the govern|ments now exi&s;ting in the world, probably originated in conque&s;t. Or, however their foundations were at fir&s;t laid, they have, through various changes, been ma|tured to what they now are. And it is far from true, that their pre&s;ent forms are the re&s;ult of a general com|pact among the people, or are a ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of their will, unle&s;s their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to them be con&s;idered as implicit con&s;ent. The in&s;tance of a numerous people, unawed by any foreign power, uncontroled by any in|ternal oppre&s;&s;or, calmly collecting the wi&s;dom and the will of the whole community; coolly examining fir&s;t principles; freely di&s;cu&s;&s;ing and declaring their natural rights, and on &s;uch a firm and rational ba&s;is, deliber|ately erecting a con&s;titution of government for them|&s;elves,
<PB N="8" REF="032462_0007_0FF274665906E028">is a &s;pectacle not le&s;s &s;ingular than augu&s;t, even in modern, more enlightened times. Nor will it, I tru&s;t, be con&s;idered as &s;avouring of national pride, rather than as expre&s;&s;ive of ju&s;t gratitude to heaven, if I add, that to no in&s;tance among the few which modern times have exhibited, claiming any title to the above de|&s;cription, is it &s;o fully applicable, as to that of our own highly favoured country.</P>
<P>AS to the de&s;ign or final cau&s;e of government, we feel no more doubt than with regard to its legitimate origin, or the proper &s;ource of the ruler's power. That is the general good of the people, as this is their gener|al will. I &s;hould blu&s;h for my country, or for my&s;elf, did I he&s;itate to &s;ay, that we are agreed in exploding the ab&s;urd idea of the many being made for the few; and of rulers, as such, not living for the people, rather than the people for them: or did I &s;uppo&s;e that it could be felt as any di&s;paragement by the latter, to be &s;tyled the &s;ervants of the public. Their u&s;eful|ne&s;s is their honour; and they are great in proportion as they mini&s;ter to the general good. This, how|ever, does by no means &s;ugge&s;t that a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their being benefactors, ought to be their only reward.&mdash;While acting in character, they merit not only the e&s;|teem and re&s;pect of the people, but have a right to find their own intere&s;ts promoted by their exertions for the benefit of others. If they are &s;ervants, they are by no means &s;laves. They are not bound to give their labor to the public, without an honourable compen&s;ation though in common with others, they ought to be under the influence of tho&s;e &s;ublime principles of patrioti&s;m and religion, which may induce them, when peculia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="9" REF="032462_0008_0FF2746A6F8C87F8">occa&s;ion calls, to make &s;uch &s;acrifices for their coun|try's welfare, as nothing but the gratitude and affec|tion of their country can repay.</P>
<P>THIS repre&s;entation of the de&s;ign of government and the ruler's power is not le&s;s agreeable to &s;cripture, than it is to enlightened rea&s;on; and is indeed, &s;ugge&s;ted by the apo&s;tle in the words preceding the text. He &s;peaks of governors as &s;ent "for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well." The office of the ruler or magi&s;trate is not le&s;s honora|ble or nece&s;&s;ary becau&s;e a part, and no &s;mall part, of the good which it produces is of the negative kind, or con&s;i&s;ts in preventing evil. And if the puni&s;hing or preventing of evil &s;eem, according to the apo&s;tle's re|pre&s;entation, to be the object of government and its laws, rather than recompencing &s;uch as do well: or we be ready to a&s;k why prai&s;e is the only recompen&s;e allotted to well-doing, while puni&s;hment is the portion of tho&s;e who do evil; we &s;hall neverthele&s;s find his manner of expre&s;&s;ion &s;ufficiently accurate, if we con&s;ider that well-doing, in the &s;en&s;e here made u&s;e of, is its own re|ward. He who carefully ob&s;erves the laws of &s;ociety; who is ju&s;t, faithful, &s;ober and temperate, wi&s;ely pur&s;ues the path of hone&s;t indu&s;try, finds his advantage in &s;o doing, without any direct reward from the govern|ment under which he lives. Virtue tends to happine&s;s. Such is the con&s;titution of heaven. This tendency, in|deed, is often counteracted by the follies and vices of men. A virtuous individual might be happy in the &s;tate of nature; at lea&s;t he might be free from tho&s;e evils and injuries again&s;t which government is calcu|lated to protect him, if all around were as innocent and
<PB N="10" REF="032462_0009_0FF2746C1A2DC070">virtuous as he. The primary de&s;ign of government, therefore is, not &s;o much to render the &s;ubjects of it po&s;|itively happy, as to prevent their being rendered mi&s;er|able by the violence, inju&s;tice, fraud or negligence of their fellow men. This appears to be in perfect con|formity to the apo&s;tle PAUL's ideas, when he exhorts that "&s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions and giving of thanks be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority, <HI>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI>"</P>
<P>IT is to be observed, however, that all laws are not of the penal kind, or de&s;igned to deter from the commi&s;|&s;ion of crimes. Some propo&s;e rewards. Their imme|diate object is to encourage exertions, in a particular line, calculated to promote the general good. And many others, though neither directly penal, nor of the kind la&s;t mentioned, are profe&s;&s;edly de&s;igned to increa&s;e the public emolument, &s;trength and pro&s;perity, while they &s;ecure the peace and liberty of virtuous individu|als. In a word, civil government, when wi&s;ely and faithfully admini&s;tered, is as really calculated as it is de|&s;igned to improve the condition of mankind, and to widen the &s;phere of their enjoyments, as well as to reg|ulate and protect them. A very exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e may, therefore, be ju&s;tly given to the Apo&s;tle's expre&s;&s;ion, when &s;peaking of the civil ruler: "He is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for good."</P>
<P>No man who impartially reads the exhortations of ST. PETER in the context, with tho&s;e of ST. PAUL in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, and in his charge to TITUS, relative to civil obedience and &s;ubjection; and recol|lects the language of our SAVIOUR, on which his conduct
<PB N="11" REF="032462_0010_0FF2746DED50B928">was &s;o ju&s;t a comment, with reference to the &s;ame &s;ub|ject, can refu&s;e to acknowledge that the Chri&s;tian relig|ion &s;ufficiently inculcates &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government, and looks with a very friendly a&s;pect on civil order and &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>INDEED, &s;o &s;trongly and with &s;o little limitation has chri&s;tianity enjoined &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the ruling powers, as to give &s;ome degree of plau&s;ibility to the charge of its being unfriendly to the liberty of the &s;ubject, and the unalienable rights of men. The doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o favourable to the &s;elfi&s;h views and ambition of tyrants, and &s;o degrading to the human character in general, has pre&s;umed to derive its origin from this religion, or at lea&s;t, with confidence appealed to it for &s;upport. It is pre&s;umed, however, that the expre&s;&s;ions in the New Te&s;tament, which &s;eem mo&s;t to favour the beloved doctrine of tyrants, may be fairly explained and accounted for, in &s;uch a manner that they will appear to give no real countenance to &s;uch a doctrine; and further, that upon an impartial view of the Chri&s;tian religion, we &s;hall find abundant rea&s;on to acknowledge that it is mo&s;t friendly to rational liberty, and that the &s;pirit of it is mo&s;t congenial to that of free governments.</P>
<P>THERE is good rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing that the exhorta|tions of the Apo&s;tles, recommending quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the ruling powers, were occa&s;ioned, e&s;pecially by, and had a particular reference to a prejudice which then exi&s;ted in the minds of the Gentiles, and was taken ad|vantage of by the Jews, again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, as though they were enemies to all government, and thought them&s;elves on account of their relation to CHRIST,
<PB N="12" REF="032462_0011_0FF274768D70F6B8">freed from all &s;ubjection to any earthly power. This prejudice probably aro&s;e from confounding Chri&s;tians with Jews; and knowing that principles of a very &s;e|ditious nature, criminal to the Roman, and indeed to all civil government, were really held by a &s;ect among the latter, originated by JUDAS of Galilee, and on that account, called, Galileans, a name which, by the Hea|thens, was indi&s;criminately given to the Chri&s;tians, in the early days of our religion.</P>
<P>As the principle attributed, though unju&s;tly, to the Chri&s;tians, or at lea&s;t to Chri&s;tianity, was &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of all order and government, it was of great importance that they &s;hould carefully guard again&s;t every thing in their language and conduct, which might tend, in the lea&s;t to ju&s;tify their enemies in fixing it upon them. This may well account for the Apo&s;tle's urging obedi|ence to the ruling powers, in terms &s;o &s;trong and ab&s;o|lute; and explains their giving the following or a &s;imi|lar rea&s;on for their thus pre&s;&s;ing it upon their Chri&s;tian brethren,&mdash;"That the word of God be not bla&s;phem|ed." It &s;hews also, that their object was not to define the limits of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but to evince the obligation to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in general. Can it then be fairly inferred from any thing which they have written, that our relig|ion may be ju&s;tly charged with being unfriendly to lib|erty, or giving any countenance to oppre&s;&s;ive and ty|rannical government? Would the charge be ju&s;t, though we &s;hould allow that it was the de&s;ign of the Apo&s;tles to recommend to their Chri&s;tian brethren, in exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, an unre&s;erved obedience to the ruling powers; not merely to &s;uch as were good and ju&s;t, but to all without exception, to the rulers of that
<PB N="13" REF="032462_0012_0FF2747AECD4BEE0">day, who, it is well known, were &s;ufficiently de&s;potic and oppre&s;&s;ive? Certain it is, that had they undertaken to qualify the obedience of the &s;ubject, the end of their exhortations would have been fru&s;trated; for they would by no means have vindicated them&s;elves, in the eyes of the government, from the &s;candal to which they were expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that our religion has been thought &s;uf|ciently defen&s;ible again&s;t the imputation of teaching the &s;lavi&s;h doctrine of unlimited obedience and pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, upon the idea that the &s;acred writers, when they inculcate &s;ubjection, in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t un|qualified terms, &s;till di&s;cover, by the arguments which they make u&s;e of to inforce it, that they con&s;ider gov|vernment and ruling powers as what they ought to be, not regarding what they really were: That they urge obedience upon the principle that the civil magi&s;trate is the mini&s;ter of GOD for good, unto the people, and therefore that their obligation to obedience cannot be inferred, when he cea&s;es to maintain this character, and becomes their &s;courge and oppre&s;&s;or. But if this con|&s;truction of the apo&s;tolic writings, and particularly of ST. PAUL's rea&s;oning in the 13th chapter of <HI>Romans,</HI> be ju&s;t, which, however, is not undi&s;puted, there appears to be no occa&s;ion for having recour&s;e to it.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, though it is allowed that chri&s;|tianty does not profe&s;s to define the re&s;pective pow|ers and rights of rulers and &s;ubjects, it is &s;till contend|ed that the &s;pirit of it is mo&s;t congenial to that of free governments, and evidently favourable to rational lib|erty.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="032462_0013_0FF2748104023EC0">WE readily a&s;&s;ent to our Saviour's declaration, when he &s;aid, "my kingdom is not of this world." His immediate object was to improve the hearts, and mend the morals of mankind: To reconcile them to the Deity, and thus train them up as &s;ubjects of a &s;piritual and eternal kingdom. This object however, is in per|fect con&s;i&s;tency with that of rendering them wi&s;er, bet|ter and happier, in every earthly relation, and of pro|moting the pre&s;ent welfare, both of individuals and &s;o|cieties. It is manife&s;tly, the tendency, and we need not he&s;itate to con&s;ider it as the de&s;ign, of his religion, to render men better citizens of the world as well as to make them meet for an heavenly inheritance; to give them more ju&s;t ideas of, and di&s;po&s;e them more faithfully to di&s;charge, their re&s;pective duties, whatever their rank, &s;tation or condition in life. It is, doubtle&s;s, a|greeable to his will, and in perfect conformity to the de&s;ign of his &s;piritual kingdom, that mankind &s;hould avail them&s;elves of every in&s;truction which may be de|duced from his religion, for &s;ecuring liberty, peace and po&s;perity, and enhancing tho&s;e advantages which are derived from civil government, and the laws of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity ought to be carried into the admini&s;tration of every kind of government, and to regulate the conduct of all cla&s;&s;es of men, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, but it does not thence follow that genius and principles of &s;ome kinds of government are not more nearly allied to the &s;pirit of this religion than others; or that it does not point to the election of one form, rather than another. And if there be any one form on which it looks with peculiar approbation, can we he&s;itate to &s;ay, it is the REPUBLICAN.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="032462_0014_0FF27482AEF485E8">WHEN our Saviour &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, "All ye are brethren," did he not recognize or clearly counte|nance that fundamental principle of republicani&s;m, the natural equality of men. I mean an equality with re|gard to certain natural and inherent rights; the only one which rea&s;on can &s;ucce&s;sfully undertake to defend, and which is in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with that difference and almo&s;t endle&s;s variety which is found among them, with re&s;pect to original capacity, aptitude to govern, education, riches, and influence derived from any of the&s;e &s;ources, or from all combined.</P>
<P>IT was not nece&s;&s;ary that the author of our religion &s;hould more fully avow that important maxim of all free government, that rulers are inve&s;ted with power not principally, for their own &s;akes, but for the good of the community; or that he &s;hould more clearly di&s;counte|nance the idea of hereditary power, and greatne&s;s deriv|ed from titles and di&s;tinctions, not founded on merit, than he did, when he &s;aid to his followers, "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exerci&s;e dominion over them, and they that are great exerci&s;e authority upon them; but &s;o it &s;hall not be among you: But who&s;oev|er would be great among you, let him be your mini&s;|ter, and who&s;oever will be chief among you, let him be your &s;ervant."</P>
<P>HE did not &s;ay, reject tho&s;e kinds of government which cheri&s;h &s;entiments tending to depre&s;s, and hold in va&s;&s;alage the great ma&s;s of the people; in which numbers of the community live in idlene&s;s and luxury, upon the labours of the re&s;t, and enjoy privileges and exemptions, greatly oppre&s;&s;ive to the degraded multi|tude: But he &s;aid by his Apo&s;tles, "Be ye, all of you
<PB N="16" REF="032462_0015_0FF27488873D2A28">&s;ubject one to another&mdash;Bear ye one another's burdens&mdash;And, &s;erve one another in love." And he di&s;cover|ed in a &s;triking manner, an impartial concern for all his brethren, when repre&s;ented as &s;aying, "Ina&s;much as ye did it to the lea&s;t of the&s;e, ye did it unto me."</P>
<P>HE has not &s;aid that governments, in order to their being free, mu&s;t be elective; that all the members of the community are entitled to a voice, mediately or im|mediately, in choo&s;ing their rulers, and making the laws by which they are governed; or to a degree of weight in the general &s;cale. But he has, by his Apo&s;tle, com|manded us to honour all men; and has compared the Chri&s;tian &s;ociety to the human body; repre&s;enting all the members of it as connected with, and mutually de|pendent on each other; &s;o that "the eye cannot &s;ay to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor, again, the head to the feet, I have no need of you." We are taught that "GOD hath tempered the body together, &s;o that there &s;hould be no &s;chi&s;m therein, but that the members &s;hould have the &s;ame care one of another; and whether one member &s;uffer, all the members &s;uffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle enjoins obedience and fidelity to their own ma&s;ters, on all in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude; but adds, "if thou maye&s;t be free, choo&s;e it rather," that we might not be left in doubt, which of tho&s;e two &s;tates had the preference in his mind.</P>
<P>IF it be thought of peculiar importance, in order to determine what kind of government is mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;pirit and principles of Chri&s;tianity, to en|quire what form the Author of it in&s;tituted in his
<PB N="17" REF="032462_0016_0FF2748CD6933C60">church; may I be permitted, without &s;eeming to wan|der too far from the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, or to enter too deeply into a di&s;puted que&s;tion, to ob&s;erve, conci&s;ely&mdash;that if we except what may be called Theocratic in this government, particularly the appointment of its fir&s;t officers, by CHRIST him&s;elf, and the extraordinary powers with which the&s;e officers were inve&s;ted, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ucce&s;sfully propagating a religion, &s;o &s;trong|ly oppo&s;ed by the lu&s;ts, pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of the world: If we attend to the direct evidence which we have from the New Te&s;tament, that one &s;pecies of offi|cers was elected by the brethren: If we con&s;ider that the Apo&s;tles do not appear to have had any proper &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, the end of their office being an&s;wered in the witne&s;s which they gave to the re&s;urrection of CHRIST, and the foundation which they laid for tran&s;mitting his religion to future generations: If we recollect that, by Apo&s;tolic direction, cen&s;ure was to be inflicted on an offending brother, in an a&s;&s;embly of the whole church; that no brother was forbidden to &s;peak and exhort in their religious a&s;&s;emblies; and, to mention no more, that there was, for a time, a community of goods, among the early Chri&s;tians&mdash;the conclu&s;ion appears to be ju&s;t and obvious, that, &s;o far as CHRIST has in&s;titut|ed any particular kind of la&s;ting government for his church; and &s;o far as this is pointed out to us, by the authority or example of the New Te&s;tament writers, it partakes largely and mo&s;t &s;trongly of the REPUBLICAN and ELECTIVE form.</P>
<P>I ONLY add, that the friendly a&s;pect of our religion on the cau&s;e of liberty in general, and of con&s;equence, on the mo&s;t free governments, is clearly vi&s;ible in the
<PB N="18" REF="032462_0017_0FF27490AB30D2E0">whole tenor and tendency of its precepts, which is to promote, not only the divine, but all the benevolent and &s;ocial virtues; to cheri&s;h that charity which worketh no ill to his neighbour, and to deter men from every act of inju&s;|tice, treachery or unkindne&s;s, whereby the rights and liberties of any of their brethren might be violated; in the exhortations which are given to chri&s;tians, to &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith they are made free; not to be the &s;ervants of men; not to call any man ma&s;ter on earth; not to affect being called Rabbi, and not to ex|erci&s;e lordly dominion over each other.</P>
<P>PERHAPS I ought to apologi&s;e for dwelling &s;o long upon a point, on which this re&s;pectable audience may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have felt them&s;elves previou&s;ly agreed. It is hoped, however, that an attempt to illu&s;trate the indirect te&s;timony which the be&s;t of religious furni&s;hes, in favour of our own con&s;titutions of government, will not be deemed an improper one, by the friends, either of republicani&s;m or chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>WHAT has been already &s;aid, is I tru&s;t, more than &s;uf|ficient to explain the occa&s;ion of the apo&s;tles words, in the text, and their meaning as they relate to that occa|&s;ion. This appears to be, that it was the will of GOD, with re&s;pect to the chri&s;tians to whom he wrote, that they &s;hould with due &s;ubjection to the civil powers, &s;ilence the ignorance of fooli&s;h men; or the objections and complaints of all, who, through prejudice, or want of acquaintance with them, and their religion, accu&s;ed them of principles or practices unfriendly to govern|ment. Such &s;ubjection, we have rea&s;on to conclude, was the <HI>well doing</HI> e&s;pecially intended. But taking the words in a more general &s;en&s;e, though &s;till as relating
<PB N="19" REF="032462_0018_0FF274948B3942B0">to government, and the duties connected with it, may they not, with propriety, be recommended to the at|tention both of rulers and &s;ubjects, e&s;pecially at a time when party &s;pirit is &s;o prevalent, that not a few of both find them&s;elves expo&s;ed to cen&s;ures which they ought not to de&s;erve, and which they mu&s;t naturally wi&s;h to &s;ilence?</P>
<P>BUT it may be a&s;ked, will not ignorance and folly be forever clamorous? Mu&s;t not he who attempts to &s;ilence them, undertake an helple&s;s ta&s;k? Can it be the will of GOD that we &s;hould perform impo&s;&s;ibilities? Is it not enough that we &s;hould be required to prevent or &s;ilence the complaints of the candid and judicious? To the following con&s;truction, which is pre&s;umed to be the true one, there can be no difficulty in a&s;&s;enting: That it is the duty of all to endeavour, by well doing, in their re&s;pective &s;tations and relations, to prevent every ju&s;t ground of complaint again&s;t them; and to conduct in &s;uch a manner as will have the mo&s;t probable tendency to put to &s;ilence even the ignorant and fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>PERMIT me now to &s;ugge&s;t, that if rulers would con|form to the will of GOD, and the &s;pirit of what is rec|ommended in the text, they will feel them&s;elves obliged, practically to remember the origin of government, and the &s;ource of their authority and power. If they duly con&s;ider that civil government is the ordinance of GOD, they will view them&s;elves as his mini&s;ters, and charged with an important commi&s;&s;ion from him who "&s;tandeth in the congregation of the mighty, and judgeth among the GODS." They will feel an elevation calculated, not to fo&s;ter pride, but to in&s;pire noble &s;entiments, and the mo&s;t generous and laudable kind of ambition; and cher|i&s;h
<PB N="20" REF="032462_0019_0FF2749A2DD225F8">that &s;elf re&s;pect which will render them cautious and circum&s;pect in their deportment, and fearful of &s;inking the dignity of the ruler in the vices or follies of the man. They will remember the character of him who&s;e mini&s;ters and repre&s;entatives they are; they will take heed that they do not, by unfaithfulne&s;s, negligence, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or any ba&s;ene&s;s of behaviour, mi&s;repre&s;ent and di&s;honor HIM who has put &s;uch honor upon them; and carefully endeavour to manife&s;t unto all who witne&s;s their admini&s;tration, that they know him who exerci&s;eth loving kindne&s;s, and judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the earth. They will not forget that being rai&s;ed above their brethren, in authority, does not render them le&s;s accountable to HIM who is the judge of all the earth; but rather, will be &s;eriou&s;ly impre&s;&s;ed with the intere&s;t|ing importance of that divine maxim, unto whom much is given, of him will much be required.</P>
<P>REMEMBERING also that their power is not derived immediately from GOD, but through the intervention of tho&s;e, over whom their power is extended, they will feel the propriety and importance of re&s;pecting the people, as well as them&s;elves. This caution is u&s;ually applica|ble to rulers, in all kinds of government, even the mo&s;t de&s;potic: For, in all "the phy&s;ical &s;trength re&s;ides in the governed; and this &s;trength wants only to be felt and rou&s;ed, to lay pro&s;trate the mo&s;t ancient and con|firmed dominion." But e&s;pecially may it be recom|mended to republican rulers, who&s;e authority, while in common with that of others it derives its &s;upport from public opinion, is more &s;en&s;ibly and immediately de|pendent on the &s;uffrages and general will of the govern|ed. We reprobate the incon&s;i&s;tent idea of power, de|legated
<PB N="21" REF="032462_0020_0FF274A0A8673748">to the rulers, remaining, at the &s;ame time, in the hands of the people: Yet, in governments like ours, where all delegated power may be &s;aid, by means of frequent elections, to return, after &s;hort intervals, to tho&s;e who gave it; and their right to change even the con&s;titution, when the public good may require, is clearly acknow|ledged, there appears to be a peculiar propriety in rul|ers treating the general opinion, and feelings of the people, with delicacy and re&s;pect. And this, not mere|ly for their own advantage, and with a view to the more certain enjoyment of the public confidence and affec|tion, but al&s;o from a patriotic regard to the general wel|fare and tranquillity; that the people may not be fur|ni&s;hed with a plea for attempting, or wi&s;hing, frequently, to &s;hake foundations, and make injudicious or danger|ous changes in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IT is a dictate of &s;ound policy, as well as of chri&s;tian morality, that we &s;hould, not only endeavor to do that which is right and good, but, if po&s;&s;ible, to do it in &s;uch a manner <HI>that our good may not be evil &s;poken of.</HI> It is, by no means, incon&s;i&s;tent with that firmne&s;s, and re&s;olute adherence to what appears to be right, which characterizes a good ruler, to aim, habitually, at <HI>providing things ho|ne&s;t in the &s;ight of men</HI>; and to &s;trive <HI>by manife&s;tation of the truth, to commend him&s;elf to every man's con&s;cience, in the &s;ight of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if rulers do what is in their power to put to &s;ilence the ignorance of fooli&s;h men, they will practical|ly remember the DESIGN OF GOVERNMENT, or the end for which they are inve&s;ted with authority. In the whole of their admini&s;tration, they will direct their aim, and
<PB N="22" REF="032462_0021_0FF1D8D721CFEA10">point their endeavours to the general good. Whatever &s;phere they move in the &s;y&s;tem of government, this will be the centre towards which their views and actions will tend. They will dive&s;t them&s;elves, as much as po&s;&s;ible of &s;elfi&s;h, of local, and of party prejudices. If they are legi&s;lators, they will, in making laws, ever con&s;ult the good of the whole community. And though it may be often proper to make &s;uch, as are de&s;igned to benefit, more immediately, a part, yet they will con&s;ent to none, which, in their view, will operate injuriou&s;ly with re|&s;pect to the whole. And if their office be to execute the laws, they will be guided by the &s;ame principle. They will view all cla&s;&s;es and conditions of men with an equal eye. They will not employ their power and influence to oppre&s;s the poor, in judgment; or &s;creen the guilty from de&s;erved puni&s;hment, on account of their riches or honors. They will not bear the &s;word in vain, by neglecting the duties required of them; or from &s;ini&s;ter motives, overlooking crimes which they ought to puni&s;h; but in &s;uch a manner as to be a terror to evil doers, while they are a prai&s;e to them who do well.</P>
<P>FURTHER, if rulers would, as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ecure them&s;elves from cen&s;ure, by conforming to the will of GOD, it highly concerns them to con&s;ider the influence of religion upon the pre&s;ent happine&s;s of mankind. Upon the acknowledged principle, that religion, if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence, is greatly condu|cive to the order, peace and welfare of civil &s;ociety, they will feel them&s;elves bound to make all that provi|&s;ion for di&s;&s;eminating the knowledge, and enforcing the practice of it, among the people, which is con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of con&s;cience; rights which they will
<PB N="23" REF="032462_0022_0FF274A6BAF75A28">ever hold &s;acred, and never pre&s;ume to violate, even with a view to promoting what they may e&s;teem the greate&s;t good of the community; &s;en&s;ible that they, equally with others, are bound by the prohibition, <HI>not to do evil that good may come.</HI> They will, upon the &s;ame principle, and under the conviction, that it does not appertain to them to decree articles of faith or modes of wor&s;hip, protect all denominations in the peaceable exerci&s;e of their religion, and in wor&s;hipping GOD according to the dictates of their con&s;ciences. Con&s;i&s;tently, however, with the above mentioned con|viction; and that &s;uch protection may be effectually granted, they will, not only feel them&s;elves at liberty, but under obligation to re&s;train the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e, who, regardle&s;s of all religious in&s;titutions, would throw down the barriers, de&s;igned to &s;eparate from oth|ers, that day which is peculiarly devoted to the public wor&s;hip of GOD.</P>
<P>THE ruler's re&s;pect for religion may, and ought to be di&s;covered al&s;o by di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e who appear to reverence its laws, in the di&s;tribution of public offices; &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as a due regard to other qualifications will permit. If they would &s;ilence the ignorance of the fooli&s;h, or give no occa&s;ion to the judicious and well di&s;po&s;ed to cen&s;ure their conduct, they will follow the di|rection given to the I&s;raelites, re&s;pecting the choice of their rulers and judges&mdash;provide <HI>&s;uch as fear</HI> GOD, as well as <HI>able men,</HI> and <HI>haters of covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Their eyes will be upon the faithful of the land, to honor and pro|mote them; nor will they &s;uffer con&s;iderations of friend&s;hip, affinity, or &s;elf intere&s;t to outweigh tho&s;e of per&s;onal character.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="032462_0023_0FF274ADDE6887D8">BUT there is yet another way in which their regard for religion may be mo&s;t effectually expre&s;&s;ed, and this is, exhibiting in their own characters, that which it is their duty to honour in others. It is po&s;&s;ible that men may re&s;pect religion in others, who do not habitually feel its influence them&s;elves; at lea&s;t, they may occa|&s;ionally di&s;tingui&s;h and honor it, when their own au|thority, intere&s;t, or favorite &s;chemes may be promoted by &s;o doing. It would, however, be with faint hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hould we recommend to men de&s;titute of reli|gious principle, the making of &s;uch principle an object in the appointment of others to places of power and tru&s;t. And indeed, with re&s;pect to their own fidelity, and uniform attention to the duties of their office, we cannot feel that confidence in men, who profe&s;s not to be governed by higher motives than tho&s;e of honour, civil virtue or regard to reputation, which we cheerful|ly repo&s;e in &s;uch as give us the additional &s;ecurity, which is derived from tho&s;e &s;ublime principles by which religion, and e&s;pecially the chri&s;tian religon, awes, con|trouls, directs and animates its votaries.</P>
<P>IN connexion with what has been now &s;aid, it is nat|ural to ob&s;erve, that if rulers would hope to avoid, not merely the clamours of ignorance and folly, but the frowns of knowledge and virtue, they mu&s;t be exempla|ry in their own re&s;pect for, and obedience to tho&s;e laws by which they are in&s;trumental in binding their breth|ren. If they treat their own in&s;titutions with practical contempt, they will be ju&s;tly chargeable with the ab&s;ur|dity of pulling down with one hand, what they build with the other. It is of as real importance that they &s;hould govern, as that the mini&s;ters of religion &s;hould in&s;truct and pur&s;uade, by example.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="032462_0024_0FF274AF75961038">THE inquiry, how the &s;ubjects of government ought to conduct, that they may comply with the &s;pirit of the in&s;truction given in the text, now demands our attention. The &s;um of the an&s;wer we may find in the words imme|diately following. "As free, and not u&s;ing your liberty as a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervants of GOD."</P>
<P>AS HIS &s;ervants, it becometh them to remember that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government is a duty, than which &s;carcely any one appears to be more clearly enjoined by HIM. Rea&s;on teaches us that whatever tends to promote the happine&s;s of mankind, is agreeable to the benevolent author of our beings. For the necessity, importance and &s;alutary tendency of government, of laws and magi&s;trates, to be a terror to evil doers, and a protection, as well as prai&s;e to them that do well, we need not ap|peal merely to the feelings of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered in their per&s;ons, their property or their connexions, by the audacious wickedne&s;s of the high-way robber, or the in&s;idious, and even more alarming villany of the midnight thief, incendiary and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. On this point general experience abundantly confirms the deci&s;ion of rea&s;on. The conclu&s;ion is obvious. The voice of revelation, al&s;o, is clear and deci&s;ive upon our obliga|tion to civil obedience: So clear, that we may &s;afely pronounce real enemies to government, to civil order and &s;ubordination, practical enemies, at lea&s;t, to our holy religion. Whatever they may be in name, they are not chri&s;tians in &s;pirit and in truth. To declare any one, an enemy to government in general, is there|fore a high and grievous charge. It may be, and, no doubt, often is mi&s;applied. This may be the language
<PB N="26" REF="032462_0025_0FF274B118005920">of ignorance, of folly, of prejudice or malice, as well as the complaints which are too often uttered again&s;t tho&s;e by whom government is admini&s;tered. Nothing which &s;ober rea&s;on dictates, or which CHRIST, or his apo&s;tles have taught, on this &s;ubject, furni&s;hes any ju&s;t ground for the pretence, that re&s;i&s;tance to the ruling powers is, in all ca&s;es, contrary to the will of GOD, and the &s;pirit of our religion: Much le&s;s, that all di&s;approbation of, or &s;peaking again&s;t the mea&s;ures of tho&s;e in authority, is criminal. We have not &s;o learned CHRIST, nor the principles of civil &s;ubjection. In this re&s;pect we may, and ought to conduct as free. But if we would do what we ought to prevent or &s;ilence complaints, with regard to the u&s;e which we make of our liberty, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the ill con&s;equences of a groundle&s;s diminution of the public confidence, in our civil rulers. We mu&s;t remember that although they may not intro|duce more of my&s;tery into their admini&s;tration, than particular circum&s;tances, or the general nature of gov|ernment may require, yet we are not capable of know|ing, in all ca&s;es, at lea&s;t, immediately, the motives which influence their conduct. Their means of infor|mation are more perfect, and their field of vi&s;ion more exten&s;ive than tho&s;e of private individuals. The&s;e con|&s;iderations will dictate candour and tenderne&s;s, in the judgments which we form of their public conduct, in tho&s;e in&s;tances which appear mo&s;t doubtful, or liable to &s;u&s;picion; and are calculated to produce a habit of manly and generous, though not of blind and implicit confidence, in the uprightne&s;s of their views, and the wi&s;dom of their mea&s;ures. The &s;ame con&s;iderations &s;hould al&s;o in&s;pire us with the truly patriotic re&s;olution,
<PB N="27" REF="032462_0026_0FF274B55F5823B0">of &s;tanding forth in the defence of our rulers, when we conceive them to have done well, and their mea&s;ures to be unju&s;tly attacked; and induce us, by enlighten|ing, according to our ability, the ignorant, to &s;ilence, if po&s;&s;ible, their groundle&s;s complaints. Permit me to ob&s;erve, that &s;uch a kind of confidence, as has been rec|ommended, may, with peculiar ju&s;tice, be expected of the &s;ubjects of &s;uch a government as our own, in which all the rulers are, either directly or indirectly, appoint|ed by the people: Since, in cen&s;uring them we do, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ca&s;t a reflection on our own, or at lea&s;t, the public wi&s;dom or integrity.</P>
<P>WHILE we hold fa&s;t the liberty of private judgment, and a&s;&s;ert our right to inve&s;tigate and di&s;cu&s;s the mea|&s;ures of government, if we would give no ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence, we &s;hall exerci&s;e this right with prudence and decency. We &s;hall appeal to di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate rea&s;on and argument; and not have recour&s;e to reviling, &s;cur|rility and abu&s;e. Tho&s;e do but injure a good cau&s;e, while they render a doubtful one, &s;till more &s;u&s;picious. Need I add, that fal&s;ehood and deception, however they may be viewed by the optics of corrupt policy, or violent party zeal, are a kind of weapons which will be rejected with abhorrence, by every true friend of liber|ty, of government, and his country.</P>
<P>THE man to whom this character belongs, whatever his &s;entiments may be on di&s;puted political que&s;tions, will, we may expect, quietly yield up private opinion to that of the pubic, as expre&s;&s;ed by the con&s;tituted or|gans of the general voice; &s;o far at lea&s;t, as to &s;ubmit, without difficulty or oppo&s;ition, to its e&s;tabli&s;hed effects. He will rejoice in the pro&s;perity of his country, wheth|er
<PB N="28" REF="032462_0027_0FF274BFF0AB88A0">it were produced by the means which he preferred, or not. And with re&s;pect to mea&s;ures which involve only the que&s;tion of expediency, not that of ju&s;tice and right, will feel willing that events &s;hould determine their wi&s;dom or impropriety.</P>
<P>I ONLY ob&s;erve further, that a due regard to the will of GOD, and the peace, order and welfare of &s;ociety, will deter him from imputing to tho&s;e who differ from him, in &s;ome of their &s;entiments, on public mea&s;ures, wor&s;e motives and intentions than their conduct clearly indicates; and from exa&s;perating the &s;pirit of party, when already too violent for the health of the political body.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid of the friendly a&s;pect of the chri&s;tian religion on civil liberty, and the congeniality of its &s;pirit to that of the mo&s;t free governments, we may infer, that as conformity to its principles and obedience to its precepts prevail, the rights of men will be more thoroughly under&s;tood, and more &s;acredly regarded.</P>
<P>AND may we not view it, at lea&s;t, as probable, that the exten&s;ion of republican principles and forms of gov|ernment will accompany that &s;preading of the go&s;pel, in its power and purity, which the &s;cripture prophe|cies repre&s;ent as con&s;tituting the glory of the latter days? The &s;urpri&s;ing changes and revolutions which have taken, and are taking place in <HI>Europe,</HI> loudly pronounce the pre&s;ent an eventful period. Whether they be not the wheels, in the grand machinery of providence, which are to have a di&s;tingui&s;hed efficien|cy in ha&s;tening the fulfilment of ancient predictions, re|lative to the downfal of anti-chri&s;tian and tyrannical power, and thus introducing the reign of truth, of peace,
<PB N="29" REF="032462_0028_0FF274C408D9C710">and equal liberty, is an inquiry which may well arre&s;t the attention of every &s;erious and enlightened believer in revelation.</P>
<P>NOR am I deterred from offering the above &s;ugge&s;t|ion, by reflecting that the great and formidable Repub|lic, which makes &s;o con&s;picuous a figure on the bloody theatre, has, in the mid&s;t of revolutionary violence, and their zeal for de&s;troying the corrupt appendages of the chri&s;tian religion, made war upon chri&s;tianity it&s;elf: Nor by a review of tho&s;e attendant enormities, from which humanity ever mu&s;t, and, as we have rea&s;on to hope, the nation among whom they were perpetrated now generally does, turn away with abhorrence: Nor by any thing which may be ju&s;tly thought equivocal, or alarming in their pre&s;ent de&s;igns or conduct, relative to us, or to &s;urrounding nations.</P>
<P>To the prevalence of infidelity, and an unparalleled pro&s;tration of chri&s;tian principles and in&s;titutions, may be ju&s;tly attributed, in no &s;mall degree, tho&s;e &s;hocking evils which tarni&s;hed the glory of their wonderful revo|lution. Nor let us ha&s;tily conclude that the &s;trange and impious attempts to bani&s;h chri&s;tianity, in the days of anarchy and confu&s;ion, will prove effectual to hold it in la&s;ting exile;&mdash;or prevent its return, in an improved and more rational form, to ble&s;s the reign of order, peace and &s;ettled government. Be&s;ides, we acknowl|edge that the power and wi&s;dom of the Deity are often exerci&s;ed in bringing good out of evil. HE di&s;appoint|eth the devices of the crafty, carrieth headlong the coun|&s;el of the froward, and bringeth about the mo&s;t important events, by the means which they make u&s;e of to defeat them. We remember how the enemies of CHRIST

We recollect that the A&s;|&s;yrian monarch is called <HI>the rod of GOD's anger</HI>; and that the righteous de&s;igns of the Almighty Ruler were carried into effect through his in&s;trumentality, though <HI>he meant not &s;o, neither did his heart think &s;o; but it was in his heart to de&s;troy and cut off nations, not a few.</HI> And we a&s;&s;ent to the &s;cripture declaration: "Surely the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee; the remainder of wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train."</P>
<P>REFLECTING on the legitimate origin, and de&s;ign of civil government, what abundant rea&s;on have we to feli|citate our&s;elves on being the inhabitants of a country, in which the former is &s;o clearly, and practically recog|nized, and the latter &s;o rationally and happily pur&s;ued! It is our happy lot to live under civil con&s;titutions "which unite, and by their union e&s;tabli&s;h, liberty with order;" the latter of which is not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to our permanent welfare, than liberty it&s;elf. We are citizens not merely of a &s;ingle COMMONWEALTH, but al&s;o, of a FEDERAL REPUBLIC, which unites, for general defence, and many important purpo&s;es, under one common head, a number of di&s;tinct States, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of qualified &s;ove|reignty, &s;pread over an extensive country; and thus, without endangering freedom, or giving up any thing e&s;&s;ential to the republican form of government, in a great mea&s;ure, if not entirely, obviates the often repeat|ed objection again&s;t this form, as being compatible only to a &s;mall extent of territory.</P>
<P>NOR are our religious rights le&s;s firmly &s;ecured to us than our civil. Not by legal e&s;tabli&s;hments. Not by
<PB N="31" REF="032462_0030_0FF274C76A3A3DE0">any other alliance between the church and &s;tate, than what con&s;i&s;ts in that rational re&s;pect which each enter|tains for the other, founded on a conviction of the im|portance, both of religion and government, to the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ociety. While religion, and the chri&s;tian re|ligion is countenanced, if not directly patronized by the ruling powers, every man is at liberty to wor&s;hip GOD in the manner which his con&s;cience dictates to be right. The citizens of the UNITED STATES are highly favour|ed, in as much as they are not &s;hackled in their inquiries, by the baneful influence of a powerful and bigoted hierar|chy, on the one hand; nor, with plea&s;ing confidence, I add, taught by general infidelity and irreligion, in their civil rulers, to &s;light the in&s;titutions of Chri&s;tianity, or to neglect the &s;upport, or de&s;pi&s;e the in&s;tructions of their &s;piritual teachers, on the other.</P>
<P>THAT the great body of the people are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an uncommon degree of valuable knowledge, compared with mo&s;t, if not all other nations, with whom we are acquainted; that the arts and &s;ciences are flouri&s;hing; that the means of education are improving, as well as increa&s;ing, and that religion is generally re&s;pected, a|mong&s;t us, are con&s;iderations which tend to confirm the plea&s;ing hope, that the TEMPLE OF LIBERTY which has been erected in this We&s;tern world, will be as re|nowned for its duration, as it is for the harmony of its proportions, and the &s;imple elegance of its &s;tructure.</P>
<P>WERE we to take a review, (which however, the time will not permit,) of the various &s;cenes through which we have pa&s;&s;ed, in our progre&s;s from a &s;tate of depen|dence on a di&s;tant power, who&s;e impolitic mea&s;ures for
<PB N="32" REF="032462_0031_0FF274C91A734938">&s;ecuring, more firmly, our &s;ubjection, were the means of lo&s;ing it entirely, to our pre&s;ent &s;tate of independence, pro&s;perity, wealth and re&s;pectability, the recollection might well excite a throng of emotions in our brea&s;ts, a|mong which, gratitude to heaven would ju&s;tly claim the preeminence. For it was not our own arm that &s;aved us; but the right hand of the LORD, and his arm, and the light of his countenance. This pious affection, however by no means forbids, and, I tru&s;t, will not ex|clude the gratitude &s;o ju&s;tly due to tho&s;e patriotic war|riors and &s;tate&s;men, whom heaven has honoured, in making them important in&s;truments of our political &s;al|vation and national pro&s;perity. Among this band of worthies, it would be unnatural and unju&s;t, not to di&s;|tingui&s;h the late illu&s;trious Pre&s;ident of the United States. Viewing him both in his military and civil character, and tracing him through the whole cour&s;e of his patri|otic and benevolent labours, who will deny that he has well done, and de&s;erved mo&s;t highly of his country? May that retirement, to which he has been followed by an unparalleled &s;hare of the public applau&s;e, e&s;teem and gratitude, be as happy as it is dignified; and the even|ing of his life as peaceful and &s;erene, as its day has been active and u&s;eful!</P>
<P>WHILE we cheerfully pay this tribute of re&s;pect to the di&s;tingui&s;hed merits of the retired Pre&s;ident, we di&s;|claim the idea, of our political &s;alvation or pro&s;perity depending on the name or the virtues of a &s;ingle citi|zen, however illu&s;trious. Let the well known abilities, the exten&s;ive political knowledge, the integrity and pa|trioti&s;m of that highly re&s;pectable character, who now fills the first &s;eat in our national government, be our ju&s;|tification
<PB N="33" REF="032462_0032_0FF274D06E9F93D0">in &s;o doing. And let the general &s;atisfaction with which the re&s;ult of a late intere&s;ting election was re|ceived; and the confidence, and &s;pirit of conciliation with which both the fir&s;t and &s;econd in command, ap|pear to be viewed by the people at large, &s;uffice to fal&s;ify the gloomy predictions, and di&s;appoint the fears and hopes of &s;uch as have, either kindly trembled for our &s;afety, or viewed with a jealous eye, our ri&s;ing great|ne&s;s and re&s;pectability.</P>
<P>AMONG the public cau&s;es of joy and gratitude, it is far from the lea&s;t, that we have been enabled to realize the invaluable ble&s;&s;ing of peace, while other nations, with whom we are connected, have &s;o &s;everely experi|enced the calamities of war. Our joy has, however, lately felt a check, and a cloud has, in a degree, ob&s;cur|ed the face of our national pro&s;perity, in con&s;equence of the mi&s;under&s;tanding which has taken place, between our government and the Republic of France. Never|thele&s;s, we tru&s;t that tho&s;e ties which bind the two na|tions to each other, will not be lightly broken by either; and that both under&s;tand their honour and intere&s;t too well, to widen, rather than attempt healing the unhappy breach. With re&s;pect to our own government, we feel full confidence that, from a conviction of the undimin|i&s;hed value of peace, and a due regard to the dictates of general benevolence, they will be induced, before an appeal is made to the &s;word, to pur&s;ue the expedient of negociation, as far as national dignity will permit: Far|ther than this, it is pre&s;umed, no citizen of independent America will wi&s;h them to go; or patiently bear the humiliating idea of being controuled, or dictated to, by any foreign nation whatever.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="032462_0034_0FF274DC5DAC15A8">happine&s;s of tho&s;e who have placed confidence in their wi&s;dom and integrity. We tru&s;t they will not forget the &s;alutary influence of religion, on the welfare of civil &s;o|ciety, nor the peculiar importance of the general diffu|&s;ion of knowledge, in a Republic. We therefore antic|ipate their &s;olicitous, and unremitted concern, not on|ly for our Univer&s;ity, and Academies, but for tho&s;e &s;mall|er and more common &s;eminaries of learning, on which our dependence, for the general di&s;&s;emination of the mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge, and a great part of the benefit of public religious in&s;truction, mu&s;t ultimately re&s;t. Hap|py will it be for the people, and happier &s;till, in the end, for them&s;elves, if they con&s;cientiou&s;ly pur&s;ue the way of well-doing: If, by their laws, their influence and exam|ple, they endeavour to di&s;courage vice, and honour and promote that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation, while it lays the only &s;ure foundation of happine&s;s to individu|als, both temporal and eternal. For, if to the character of good rulers, they join that of good men, though they &s;hould not be able, at all times, to &s;ilence the ignorant and fooli&s;h, they will &s;ecure the approbation of the wi&s;e and candid; and above all, they will be glorious in the eyes of the LORD.</P>
<P>THIS whole a&s;&s;embly is reminded of the obligation which lies upon them to do well, not merely by &s;ubjec|tion to government, and giving honour, to all among their fellow-men, to whom honour is due, but by uni|form &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will, and impartial re&s;pect to all the commandments of the SUPREME RULER of the world. Let us rejoice that we are called unto liberty, and that our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government is &s;o rational a &s;er|vice. But let us take heed that we do not u&s;e our liber|ty

Let us not &s;how our&s;elves unworthy of the former, either by unrea&s;onable and groundle&s;s complaints of our rulers on the one hand, or blind and &s;ervile confidence in them on the other: By neglecting or abu&s;ing the important privilege of election, which we &s;o freely enjoy; nor by lo&s;ing &s;ight of the principles and &s;pirit of tho&s;e excel|lent con&s;titutions of government, under which we live.
