<P>_THESE words are a divine direction, given to a covenant profe&s;&s;ing People of GOD. In the Words, we have one thing <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> viz. <HI>That a profe&s;&s;ing people are &s;ometimes obligd to go forth to War a|gain&s;t their enemies.</HI> We have another thing <HI>commanded,</HI> viz. <HI>When they do &s;o, they &s;hould keep them&s;elves from every wicked thing.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="002400_0004_0FDB3A6808CBF018">1. WE have one thing <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> viz. <HI>That a profe&s;&s;ing people are &s;ometimes obliged to go forth to War again&s;t their enemies.</HI> GOD's People &s;ometimes have enemies mole&s;ting, di&s;turbing, a&s;&s;aulting of them; &s;triving to rob and &s;poil 'em of their &s;ub&s;tance, &amp; to captivate or de&s;troy their Per&s;ons. As Mens <HI>carnal minds are enmity a|gain&s;t God,</HI> (Rom. 8.7.) &s;o they naturally are a|gain&s;t one another al&s;o. Man's fallen, corrupt nature, is <HI>deceitful above all things and de&s;perate|ly wicked</HI>; it contains the Seed and root of all manner of wickedne&s;s again&s;t Men, as well as of Irreligion towards GOD. Out of Mens wicked hearts, proceed <HI>evil Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Murders,</HI> Mat. 15.19. Unregenerate wicked Men, are the <HI>Chil|dren of the Devil, his lu&s;ts they will do</HI>; and he's <HI>a Murderer from the beginning,</HI> Joh. 8.44. Mens hearts are naturally <HI>full of all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, wickedne&s;s, maliciou&s;ne&s;s, envy, murder, debate, malignity; they're implacable, unmerciful,</HI> Rom. 1.29&mdash;31. In their fle&s;h there dwells no good thing; and what are the works of the fle&s;h? Why the&s;e are &s;ome of 'em. Gal. 5.20, 21. <HI>Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, &s;trife, &s;editions, en|vyings, murders.</HI> Men under the reigning power of Sin, how do they live? Hear what the A|po&s;tle &s;ays: Tit. 3.3. <HI>We our &s;elves al&s;o were &s;ometimes fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient, deceived, &s;erving divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, living in malice and envy, hatefull and hating one another.</HI> Such car|riage among Men, is the genuine product of cor|rupt nature where it prevail, and reigns. Jam. 4.1. <HI>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts that
<PB N="3" REF="002400_0005_0FDB3A69DDB54920">
war in your members.</HI> The prevalency of Men's cur&s;ed lu&s;ts, often produceth <HI>quarrellings, fightings</HI> between <HI>particular Per&s;ons,</HI> in <HI>Families,</HI> and be|tween <HI>Countreys, Kingdoms, Nations.</HI> Wicked Nations are often enemies to and they often War again&s;t one another. And &s;ome or other of &s;uch Nations, are often open enemies to GOD's pro|fe&s;&s;ing People, &s;eeking to &s;poil, &s;ubdue and over|throw them. This truth is &s;o plain from Scrip|ture and experience, that I need not &s;ay any thing for the demon&s;trating of it.</P>
<P>AND when GOD's People are a&s;&s;aulted, mo|le&s;ted, threatened with ruin by their enemies; they're oblig'd to &s;tand on their own defence, and to indeavour the conquering of tho&s;e, who unju&s;tly &s;trive to conquer and de&s;troy them. GOD has &s;ometimes expre&s;sly <HI>commanded</HI> His People, to fight again&s;t and de&s;troy their wicked enemies. GOD &s;aid to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> concerning <HI>Sihon</HI> King of the <HI>Amorites</HI>; Deut. 2.24. <HI>Contend with him in Bat|tle.</HI> GOD gave an expre&s;s command to King <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 Sam. 15.3. <HI>Now go and &s;mite Amatek, and utterly de&s;troy all that they have, and &s;pare them not.</HI> There are <HI>Wars of the Lord,</HI> (Numb. 21.14. 1 Chron. 5.22.) and <HI>Battels of the Lord,</HI> (1 Sam. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">5.28.) and a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> has been denounc'd again&s;t &s;ome, <HI>for not coming to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord again&s;t the mighty,</HI> Judg. 5.23. It's as rea&s;onable, and often as nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>the&s;e dayes,</HI> as it was in <HI>former ones</HI>; for GOD's Peo|ple to fight again&s;t, and indeavour to &s;ubdue and de&s;troy, their wicked enemies. They're indeed &s;ometimes, yea often, oblig'd to &s;end forth their

<HI>Ho&s;t,</HI> their <HI>Armies</HI> to fight again&s;t their wicked unrighteous enemies.</P>
<P>BUT thus much may &s;uffice for the thing <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> in our Text, viz. <HI>That a profe&s;&s;ing People are &s;ometimes oblig'd to go forth to War again&s;t their enemies.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE have another thing <HI>commanded,</HI> viz. <HI>When they do &s;o, they &s;hould keep them&s;elves from every wicked thing.</HI> When GOD's People are in|gag'd in War, <HI>then</HI> they &s;hould keep them&s;elves from every wicked thing. <HI>Then,</HI> it is not to be taken <HI>exclu&s;ively of other times,</HI> as th&ocirc; at other times they might Indulge them&s;elves in wicked practices: no Indeed, for they <HI>&s;hould</HI> continually, <HI>perpetually</HI> keep them&s;elves from every wicked thing. But <HI>then</HI> e&s;pecially they &s;hould be care|ful to &s;hun all wickedne&s;s, when their <HI>Ho&s;t goes forth to War</HI>; le&s;t by Indulging any wickedne&s;s, they &s;hould provoke GOD to frown on, and fight again&s;t them. We have general Precepts, <HI>Pray always, Pray without cea&s;ing. Continuing In&s;tant in Prayer,</HI> Eph. 6.18.1 The&s; 5.17. Rom. 12.12. Yet GOD more particularly &s;ays, <HI>Call on me in the day of trouble,</HI> If any be <HI>afflicted let him pray,</HI> P&s;al. 50.15. Jam. 5.13. In our <HI>affliction we &s;hould &s;eek God early.</HI> So that we &s;hould Pray <HI>always,</HI> and yet e&s;pecially &amp; peculiarly apply our &s;elves to this duty in time of <HI>Trouble &amp; Affliction.</HI> So, we &s;hould be <HI>always</HI> careful to avoid every wicked thing; and &s;hould yet be peculiarly and e&s;peci|ally careful to avoid it, when <HI>Ingaged in War</HI> again&s;t our enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002400_0007_0FDB3A6EB944B888">WHEN the Ho&s;t goeth forth again&s;t thine enemies, <HI>then</HI> keep thee from every wicked thing. It may Imply,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT in time of War, Per&s;ons are in pe|culiar danger of Indulging them&s;elves in vicious practices. Souldiers</HI> are apt to give them&s;elves &s;uch a loo&s;e, to take &s;uch a liberty in unbecoming Words and Actions; which po&s;&s;ibly they would be <HI>a&s;ham'd</HI> or <HI>afraid</HI> to do, if at home and among their u&s;ual Neighbours. Almo&s;t every condition and bu&s;ine&s;s of Life, has it's &s;pecial or peculiar Snares and Temptations attending of it; a <HI>Souldier</HI>'s calling is attended with very great and dangerous ones. Th&ocirc; <HI>Souldiers</HI> have &s;trong <HI>Ob|ligations</HI> to be <HI>Singularly Pious,</HI> yet they have &s;trong <HI>Temptations</HI> al&s;o to be very <HI>wicked</HI>; and they're frequently and &s;hamefully overcome by their Temptations. <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> &s;eems to have caution'd <HI>Souldiers,</HI> again&s;t the evils they were mo&s;t <HI>peculiarly</HI> in danger of committing; for when they ask'd him, &s;aying, <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> He reply'd, <HI>Do violence to no man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ely, and be content with your wages.</HI> Luk. 3.14. So that the <HI>peculiar danger</HI> of Indulging wickedne&s;s, in <HI>time of War,</HI> might be one occa&s;i|on of this &s;pecial command, <HI>then</HI> keep thee from every wicked thing. It may Imply,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE very <HI>great Importance and Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> of keeping our &s;elves from every wicked thing <HI>in time of War.</HI> A <HI>wicked thing,</HI> What is that? Why it's any thing, every thing that's <HI>contrary to God's Law.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.4. <HI>Who&s;oever committeth Sin tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth al&s;o the Law, for Sinis a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="6" REF="002400_0008_0FDB3A704557EB80">
of the Law.</HI> Every thing that's contrary to GOD's Law, is <HI>Wicked, Sinful,</HI> and therefore hateful and loath&s;ome to GOD. For <HI>Sin</HI> is the <HI>abominable thing whith He hates,</HI> Jer. 44.4. He is <HI>of purer eyes than to behold evil, he cannot look upon Iniquity,</HI> Hab. 1.13. And this Infinitely great and glorious GOD to whom <HI>Sin is &s;o hate|ful.</HI> He orders, over-rules, governs all things as He will; even all things in the <HI>Armies of Hea|ven and among the Inhabitants of the earth, none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, what doe&s;t thou?</HI> Dan. 4.35. Victories and Defeats in Battle, even all events of Peace &amp; War, are Intirely at GODS di&s;po&s;e, He orders them as He will. Therefore it highly becomes a profe&s;&s;ing People Ingag'd in War, to keep in good terms with GOD, to keep them&s;elves from every wicked thing; le&s;t other|wi&s;e they &s;hould provoke Him to appear and fight again&s;t them. If they fight again&s;t Him by their Sins, they may ju&s;tly fear that He'll fight again&s;t them in His Providence. There|fore, when the Ho&s;t goeth forth again&s;t thine enemies, then <HI>keep thee</HI> from every wicked thing. <HI>Keep thee,</HI> this may refer both to the <HI>Souldiers that go forth to War,</HI> and to <HI>the re&s;t of the People that &s;tay at home.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO the Souldiers that go forth to War.</HI> Tho&s;e who go out to War, go in danger of their lives. It's true, if we &s;tay at home, live in peace, &s;eem to be mo&s;t &s;afe and &s;ecure and free from danger, yet we're liable to Death. Some grievous Sick|ne&s;s, &s;udden fit, or unexpected accident may in a little while turn us out of the World. Prov.
<PB N="7" REF="002400_0009_0FDB3A71CEAC1698">
27.1. <HI>Boa&s;t not thy &s;elf of to-morrow, thou know|e&s;t not what a day may bring forth.</HI> Jam. 4.14. <HI>Ye know not what &s;hall be on the morrow: for what is your life? It is even a vapour that appears for a little time, and then vani&s;heth away.</HI> Th&ocirc; all Per&s;ons are thus liable to Death, and they know not how &s;oon of &s;uddenly it may overtake them; yet tho&s;e who <HI>go out to War,</HI> are in <HI>more apparent</HI> eminent danger of their lives. They <HI>Jeopard their lives to the Death in the high places of the Field,</HI> Judg. 5.18. They <HI>put their lives in their bands,</HI> as 'tis &s;aid of <HI>Jeptha</HI> and of <HI>David</HI> when they went forth <HI>to Battle,</HI> Judg. 12.3. I Sam. 19.5. When Per&s;ons are Ingag'd in Battle, th&ocirc; they're never &s;o <HI>Healthy, Stout, Strong,</HI> yet they know not but that the <HI>Sword, Spear, Hatchet</HI> or <HI>Bullet</HI> of the enemy may di&s;patch 'em in a Moment, and &s;end their Souls to an endle&s;s Eternity. Surely, Per&s;ons in &s;uch danger, if they will but think, con&s;ider, and &s;hew them&s;elves Men, mu&s;t needs reckon they're &s;trongly oblig'd to <HI>keep them&s;elves from every wicked thing.</HI> They &s;hould keep them&s;elves not only from <HI>Robbing, Stealing, Profane Cur&s;ing and Swearing Drunken|ne&s;s,</HI> and &s;uch gro&s;s Scandalous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, but even <HI>from all known Sins</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible, whether <HI>Open</HI> or <HI>Secret,</HI> of <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> whether more Immediately again&s;t GOD, or more Immediately again&s;t Men. Their Military con|dition, Circum&s;tances and Services, can't weaken their obligations to Obey that GOD who is a <HI>Man of War, the God of Armies, the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the Captain of their Salvation,</HI> Exod. 13.3. 1 Sam. 17.45. Heb. 2.10. They &s;hould not dare to In|dulge

them&s;elves in any known wickedne&s;s, in any thing di&s;plea&s;ing and provoking to GOD; therefore they &s;hould not dare to Indulge them|&s;elves in <HI>Impenitence</HI> or <HI>Unbelief,</HI> than which no|thing can be more provoking to GOD, or hurt|ful to them&s;elves. Luk. 13.5. <HI>Except ye repent ye &s;hall peri&s;h.</HI> Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth not, &s;hall be damned.</HI> They &s;hould therefore be mo&s;t &s;peedy, hearty, &s;incere in Repenting of all their Sins, in Believing &amp; Tru&s;ting in JESUS CHRIST our LORD for Pardon and Salvation. This, even this is the great, indi&s;pen&s;able, mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and profitable Duty Incumbent on all that are acquainted with the Go&s;pel; and it can't be neg|lected by profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians going out to War, without the highe&s;t madne&s;s and folly that can be. It's extreamly un&s;afe, to go out to War with the guilt of all our manifold, aggravated Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions lying on our Souls. If we fight again&s;t Men with our <HI>Bodies,</HI> and again&s;t GOD by our <HI>Sins,</HI> our danger is unutterable, inconcea|ble. <HI>Who ever harden'd him&s;elf again&s;t God, and pro&s;perd</HI>?

<P>YEA, <HI>All Per&s;ons</HI> in their <HI>various Capacities,</HI> &s;hould do what they can to promote a RE|FORMATION. Jer. 25.5. <HI>Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings.</HI> REFORMATION is what GOD loudly calls for at our hands.</P>
<P>WE are lately entred into a <HI>New War,</HI> we know the <HI>beginning</HI> but dont know the <HI>end</HI> of it. We are a <HI>profe&s;&s;ing</HI> but a very <HI>degenerate</HI> People, GOD is angry with us. The la&s;t Year He &s;ore|ly Scourg'd us by Sickne&s;s, the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; it greatly hindred <HI>Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, le&s;&s;en'd</HI> our <HI>E&s;tates, thind our Numbers,</HI> by an awful Mor|tality, th&ocirc; He <HI>puni&s;h'd us le&s;s than our Iniquities de&s;ervd.</HI> This <HI>Contagious Sickne&s;s</HI> was the <HI>Rod of GOD,</HI> He whip'd us with it, and <HI>whip'd many</HI> (probably above a <HI>Thou&s;and</HI>) of this Peo|ple to Death by it. This was a very &s;ore Judg|ment of GOD, yet we're not at all Reform'd

Jer. 9.23. <HI>Thus &s;aith the LORD, Let not the wi&s;e man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might.</HI> Very weighty was that &s;aying of King <HI>Ahab,</HI> 1 King 20.11. <HI>Let not him that girdeth on his Harne&s;s, boa&s;t him&s;elf, as he that putteth it

We know not how far GOD may Imploy them, to <HI>&s;pill the Blood</HI> of this People.

Th&ocirc; we &s;hould be thankful for the &s;ucce&s;s that we've had already, yet we &s;hould not be &s;elf-confident. P&s;al 44.6. <HI>I will not tru&s;t in my Bow, neither &s;hall my Sword &s;ave me.</HI> It's very provoking to GOD and dangerous for us, to tru&s;t in means.
