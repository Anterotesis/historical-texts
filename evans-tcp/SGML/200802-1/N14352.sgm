<P>I HOPE you will not be &s;urpri&s;ed at my placing your name in the front of a piece, which I tru&s;t will meet with the approbation of the virtuous citizens of your-&s;tate.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM lxxv. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks: Unto thee do we give thanks, for that thy name is near, thy wonderous works declare.</P>
<P>The wicked flee, when no man pur&s;ueth; but the righteous are as bold as lions.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL manner of Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is, at all times, profitable for reproof or in&s;truction, that we may have knowledge upon whom the ends of the world are come.&mdash;As war is pernicious in it's nature, &s;o it is hurtful to individuals, as well as to communities, and brings with it numbers of misfortunes: extortion and inju&s;tice are it's companions; it makes many wealthy,&mdash;brings many to poverty, and, in general, the forerunners thereof &s;eem the fir&s;t to avoid it, and would willingly give up the laborious ta&s;k, without honour or profit.</P>
<P>But, as the hearts of all men are in the hands of the Lord, and he can turn them as it &s;eemeth good unto him; &s;o he can rever&s;e the fortune of war, and relieve tho&s;e who have been mightily oppre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;He is the great and univer&s;al Author of all mankind;&mdash;he ruleth and reigneth in the armies of heaven, and among&s;t the inhabitants of the earth, and there is none to &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, what doe&s;t thou?&mdash;His interpo&s;ition, in behalf of his own people, has often appeared, and brought them a joyful morning, after the long and tedious night of op|pre&s;&s;ion, cruelty, and bondage: &s;uch deliverance as this the royal P&s;almi&s;t had often experienced, and in return to his bountiful benefactor he utters forth the&s;e words&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="018182_0004_0FA5BB0092BDF940">
<HI>Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks: unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.</HI></P>
<P>In further treating on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall endeavour to give a &s;hort de&s;cription of the divine goodne&s;s towards his creatures, in all ages, and to America in general, and then &s;um up the whole by addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to the citizens of South-Carolina in particular.</P>
<P>The goodne&s;s of the munificent Creator has always been di&s;played towards his creatures; and, whoever has read the &s;acred writings, cannot fail of &s;eeing deliverance in every page:&mdash;He delivered I&s;rael from the hand of Pharaoh, when he had them in bondage, in the cruel land of Egypt, for four hundred and thirty years:&mdash;he commi&s;&s;ioned his &s;ervant Mo&s;es to &s;peak in the ears of this tyrannical monarch the&s;e awful words&mdash;<HI>If you will not let my &s;on go, even I&s;rael my fir&s;t-born, I will &s;lay thy &s;on even thy fir&s;t-born.</HI>&mdash;Ex. iv. 22, 23.</P>
<P>But this haughty Monarch, like Britain's pre&s;ent King, hardened his heart again&s;t the Lord, and it ended in his utter de&s;truction; the Red-&s;ea overwhelmed him and his furious ho&s;t. The protection of the divine goodne&s;s ap|peared further for I&s;rael, in the wilderne&s;s; David from the hands of Saul, Daniel from the lions mouth, Shadrach, Me&s;hach and Abednego, from Nebuchadnezzar's fiery furnace, Jonah from the devouring whale, and Peter from the tyrannical Herod. Acts. xii. 6, 7, 8, and following ver&s;es. There are many other wonderful de|liverances recorded in the &s;acred writings for your farther information. Thus did God deliver his people from their cruel oppre&s;&s;ions in ancient days; and as he was the God of I&s;rael, &s;o he is the God of America, and will, in his own time, deliver her from all her enemies, foreign and dome&s;tic, external and internal. Unto God then let all America give thanks, for his delivering hand has been near unto them, &s;ince the commencement of this horrid war. You have been wonderfully ble&s;&s;ed by the pro|pitious hand of Providence, &s;o as to be able to with&s;tand the vigorous attack of Britain's formidable forces, at the
<PB N="7" REF="018182_0005_0FA5BB029FA420D0">
commencement of her ho&s;tilities: when an infant country, no men, no money, no allies, no di&s;ciplined troops, to meet a veteran army commanded by able generals. The fair fields of Bo&s;ton &s;tand as eternal monuments of their &s;avage proceedings;&mdash;the blood of an Attucks, and a Maverick can tell!</P>
<P>O Britannia! Britannia! Let not avarice that fatal rock, or ambition that earthly deity, compel you to &s;pill inno|cent blood, and to delight in making carnage;&mdash;the blood of the murdered Americans will cry aloud for vengeance and retaliation. O unfortunate Huddy! where is thy indignant gho&s;t to prompt America to retaliate? O Ame|rica! patroni&s;e Mrs. A&s;gill, and, by &s;upplication and foreign mediations, &s;natch your citizens from death to life: let not a woman's weakne&s;s triumph over your &s;trength.</P>
<P>Fear not, ye virtuous and brave Americans, rewards and puni&s;hments are in re&s;erve for tho&s;e who have me|rited them. You who have fought and bled for your country, have got great con&s;olation; the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having di&s;charged your duty faithfully when in the field, mu&s;t make you &s;mile in affliction, and rejoice in tribula|tion. Your cau&s;e, conduct, fortitude and courage, have been un&s;haken, and intitled you to an alliance with one of the fir&s;t powers in Europe; the conduct of that Monarch has not been equalled in any age whatever.&mdash;O brave Americans! by him, under heaven, ye have been able to contend with the imperious and haughty &s;ons of Britain. Your &s;u&s;taining Britain's formidable forces, before your alliance with her, a&s;toni&s;hes the world, and will be the admiration of future ages;&mdash;but remember it is not your own arm that has &s;aved you; it is through the mercy of him, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion never fails.</P>
<P>O Britain! little Britain! if the earth was commi&s;&s;ioned from it's great Creator to avenge innocent blood, it would have &s;wallowed you up, as it did the company of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Be a&s;hamed, O ancient Britons! of your pa&s;t conduct towards tho&s;e, who were once the

bone of your bone, and fle&s;h of your fle&s;h; but now for ever di&s;&s;olved, and as far di&s;tant as the north is from the &s;outh. A &s;econd burning of a Norfolk, a King&s;ton, a Charle&s;town, or any other ho&s;tile attempt, will never eradicate from America's bo&s;om her growing independence. North-America, this new world, far excels you in hu|manity, genero&s;ity, and valour; they have catched the genial flame from, your ancient fires, and it is cheerfully di&s;tended through the&s;e magnificent United States&mdash; States that have re&s;i&s;ted misfortune with manly firmne&s;s, and conquered adver&s;ity in her mo&s;t gha&s;tly &s;hapes;&mdash;her lenity towards you has been unequalled; &s;he has not only &s;pared the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, but the guilty murderer has e&s;caped the &s;word of ju&s;tice. and permitted to go free: but alas! he is not free&mdash;he will be found. "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, &s;aith the Lord." Though his vengeance &s;eems &s;low, he will not let the guilty go unpuni&s;hed. It is noble to revenge, more noble to forgive;&mdash;but your lenity towards her has been of no avail; it has been like adding fuel to the burning flame, and &s;erved to embitter the captivity of your &s;uffering countrymen, who now lie expo&s;ed in dark dungeons, and loath&s;ome pri&s;on &s;hips, naked, half &s;tarved, and waiting there the&s;e alternatives&mdash; death, exchange, or your conquering their conquerors. Ri&s;e and di&s;pel, di&s;&s;ipate and &s;catter them from their la&s;t &s;trong hold; drive out the&s;e Canaanites from their dwell|ing among&s;t the true I&s;raelites: they have too long dwelt among&s;t you&mdash;too long afflicted your citizens, the free|men of America.</P>
<P>Ye hills and dales! ye mountains and vallies! cry aloud, Retaliate, relatiate.&mdash;O Britain! have thy &s;avage &s;oldiery and ruthle&s;s &s;word wantonly and barbarou&s;ly deprived the man of integrity of his life, made his children fatherle&s;s, and his wife a widow: you &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed: their blood will cry to heaven for vengeance, as the blood of the Gibeonites did to the hou&s;e of Saul, in the days of David. 2 Sam. xxi. 1. For you, O Britain! there is wrath in &s;tore; under &s;ome hidden cloud, there is a rod
<PB N="9" REF="018182_0007_0FA5BB041BFF7330">
for the oppre&s;&s;or, and a &s;word of ju&s;tice for him that delighted in blood. Ju&s;tice will find out the wilful mur|derer and the private a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, after expiring years, as the &s;on of Timoleon did the murderer of his father in the temple. Your robberies and plundering, murders and depredations, have gained you the abhorrence of all America. Death and de&s;truction have been the lot of her virtuous &s;ons, whenever fortune throws them into your hands. No di&s;tinction has been made; the noble and the ignoble fell victims alike in one common carnage: though you may imagine you have been always victorious, if you recollect the defeats and retreats, you will cea&s;e boa&s;ting, and call upon your &s;kilful General, retreating before the undi&s;ciplined army of the magnanimous Wa&s;hington.&mdash; White Plains, Red Bank, Brandywine, Bunker's Hill, Princeton, Monmouth, Germantown and Trenton, are &s;ufficient evidences again&s;t your boa&s;tings. Your expe|rienced Generals forget their le&s;&s;ons, when attacked by Americans&mdash;and no wonder; the former endeavouring to take away liberty, heaven's choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; the latter determined to defend it to the la&s;t extremity. Her un|&s;haken and intrepid &s;oldiery have overcome difficulties, (even with a treacherous Arnold) that &s;eemed to mankind un&s;urmountable, and gained him the character of Han|nibal. The cold regions of Canada, Lake Champlain, and Ticonderoga, have nobly told of her heroic &s;ons.</P>
<P>Dear &s;ons of liberty, excu&s;e an Aethiopian; reward your military for their eminent &s;ervices done you in the field; they have endured, with a veteran firmne&s;s, the powerful attacks of Britain's &s;uperior force, whenever brought to action. The wounded &s;oldier, who has lo&s;t a leg or an arm, or both legs, in the defence of his country, calls loudly for your approbation, and immediate a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Dear fellow citizens, let not &s;uch merit go un|rewarded. Courage de&s;erves applau&s;e, and heroic acts your be&s;t approbation. Let not the decea&s;ed &s;oldier's widows and orphans want bread, in any of your &s;tates. The &s;oldier thus rewarded, will always be ready to take
<PB N="10" REF="018182_0008_0FA5BB04D85D59B8">
the field with vigour and &s;pirit, when the public cau&s;e demands his a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t any foreign invaders, or dome&s;tic u&s;urpers: the&s;e are the men who have been &s;ub|&s;ervient towards erecting the magnificent edifice of your flouri&s;hing Independence; and, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, are as &s;o many branches of that American tree&mdash;that tree which Britain has been endeavouring to eradicate from your minds, but cannot, and, I hope, will not while America has a name.&mdash;Be no more her &s;laves, leave that conde&s;cen&s;ion to foreign petty princes, who have hired their troops to &s;ubdue you.&mdash;But all is in vain;&mdash;they, tired of de&s;poti&s;m, de&s;ert the royal cau&s;e, remain in America as tillers of the earth, hewers of wood, and drawers of water, and left their hire in the hands of a tyrannical King and factious Parliament to decide. O ye Americans! exalted by heaven&mdash;Say with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks,</HI> for delivering us from the bitter enemies of America. May we be thank|ful, and make our &s;tates independent &s;tates indeed, by gradually aboli&s;hing &s;lavery, and making the Aethiopian race comfortable among&s;t us.</P>
<P>I have greatly enlarged on America in general, yet have not forgotten Carolina in particular, and will, immedi|ately after this one remark, addre&s;s my&s;elf to its inhabi|tants on the evacuation of Charle&s;town.</P>
<P>Fear not, ye &s;ons of Columbia! Britain has ri&s;en to her zenith, as the empires of Cyrus and Belus; like them &s;he will meet her approaching di&s;&s;olution, and moulder with them into ruin. The &s;word of America, and her allies, will yet cau&s;e Britain's King to tremble on his throne, and &s;hake it to it's very foundation. Her &s;uc|ce&s;s, with the navy of our allies, in the We&s;tern I&s;les, and her defeating the combined forces at the Rock, have made her more arrogant and haughty; though her boa&s;t lies in her naval force, &s;he will not always be victorious: the race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong. Briti&s;h veterans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Battle at Stony-point.</NOTE> have intreated for mercy from
<PB N="11" REF="018182_0009_0FA5BB05A543A858">
the undi&s;ciplined Americans, and mercy they found from that officer who&s;e name has been a terror to them, Major General Wayne.</P>
<P>Now let me addre&s;s my worthy &s;ons of Carolina's &s;tate. All hail, you &s;taunch Carolinians, you &s;uffering Ameri|cans! I welcome you to your own &s;tate once more. I congratulate you on the happy event. My returning fellow citizens, my worthy Carolinians&mdash;I mean you who have been eye-witne&s;&s;es of national faith and &s;olemn ca|pitulations &s;candalou&s;ly broken&mdash;You who have been po|litically &s;ent away three hundred miles &s;outh of your own country, to &s;uffer eleven months captivity in the dreary de&s;art of Ea&s;t-Florida&mdash;You who have had your beloved wives &s;ent with their children to the north, by your im|placable and bitter enemies&mdash;I congratulate you on the evacuation of Charle&s;town; a period long expected by you, though never de&s;ired by your enemies; they, with the loyal &s;ycophant, never expected your return: but all their hopes are vain. Even an infatuated mini&s;try had &s;ome ideas, that America was &s;ubdued, when your ca|pital was reduced by Sir Henry Clinton: great honour he gained with his thou&s;ands, and a formidable fleet, when he obliged a handful of men, one half of whom were di&s;affected, to &s;urrender; and this they did not do, until compelled by nece&s;&s;ity, and not before the American cannon thundered in his ears, and &s;lew &s;ome of his cho&s;en men. O Charle&s;town! did Britain &s;end her thronged le|gions to thy peaceful &s;hore, to di&s;tre&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;s, and then to evacuate it? they thought that America's independent &s;un was &s;et in darkne&s;s, when Clinton marched into your capital; but how have they been deceived! though it &s;et in the &s;outh, it ro&s;e in the north, and compelled the &s;outhern hero to capitulate with his thou&s;ands. You who have without delay, &s;ince your exchange, joined your American brethren in the field, under that re&s;pect|able and gallant Commander, Major General Greene. You who have endured with him watching, and every &s;oldierly hard&s;hip&mdash;you I congratulate on the happy event.
<PB N="12" REF="018182_0010_0FA5BB0664952490">
You wealthy farmers, who have had your hou&s;es and e&s;tates plundered; you who have &s;uffered in every part, and have now returned, prai&s;e ye the Lord: you who u&s;ed to live by the &s;weat of your brow, in peace and con|tentment, return; the gates of your city are now wide expanded for your reception, and, I hope, will never be barred any more, except by you again&s;t invaders.</P>
<P>Britain's ho&s;tile forces unable to conquer, and tired of being defeated, quaked with fear, and were obliged to evacuate your capital; the many battles which have been fought, &s;ince the reduction of Charle&s;town, are more than I can at pre&s;ent recollect; their barbarities, at the battle of Camden, are unparalleled in any civilized coun|try. See them, though boa&s;ting, yet wor&s;ted at the battle of Guildford, by the gallant General Greene. See them &s;hamefully beaten at the Cowpens. See their &s;hat|tered army, under Stewart, flying into Charle&s;town, from the battle of the Eutaw Springs, though they boa&s;ted of their victory by fortune throwing into their hands Lieu|tenant Colonel Wa&s;hington, and &s;ome other pri&s;oners. See Lord Rawdon flying before the country militia, and retreating into Charle&s;town. See them checked all over your &s;tate by the Generals Greene, Wayne and Marion. See them at la&s;t driven in from the out po&s;ts which they held, and circum&s;cribed to the capital. See them reduced to the wretched alternative of bartering merchandize for produce, for the &s;u&s;tenance of their troops. See them at la&s;t obliged to &s;end a &s;trong force for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply of water. See them at la&s;t obliged to quit their temporary habitation, and to &s;eek an a&s;&s;ylum in the mighty deep, and the We&s;tern I&s;lands. Let Carolina rejoice, and all her numerous citizens, at the goodne&s;s of the Lord, for delivering their land from a &s;avage foe; enemies that are wor&s;e than the Heathens who dwell in the dark regions of Africa. See them gone; though not before permitting their adherents to &s;pill innocent blood.</P>
<P>O Britain! Britain! thy vice has given &s;anction to
<PB N="13" REF="018182_0011_0FA5BB07614D0E10">
numberle&s;s barbarities in America. Exa&s;perated at leav|ing your &s;tate, they &s;hed the blood of war in the time of an evacuation fixed by treaty; but no ties of honour can bind a lo&s;t nation; your &s;ervants they have carried away in violation of the treaty, and &s;ome of them will feel the effects of their folly, in the places whither they are gone. Rejoice ye United States with your &s;i&s;ter Carolina, for her pre&s;ent glorious &s;ituation; rejoice with her particu|larly Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay, Penn&s;ylvania, and Georgia. You have felt with her Briti&s;h impo&s;ition, and they have left your &s;tates as they left her in ha&s;te, and great preci|pitation. The embarra&s;&s;ment of a Dorche&s;ter hill in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's government, cau&s;ed them to take &s;hipping, and flee away in great fear. The manoeuvres of a Wa&s;hington, in defeating their armies, when they laid in Penn&s;ylvania, and the expectation of a D'E&s;taing, pro|duced a &s;peedy evacuation. A gallant Wayne, before the lines of Savanna, compelled them to leave the capital al&s;o. The vigilance of a Greene, under Heaven, has terrified them, and brought about to your great joy, the evacuation of your capital: then unto God give thanks, and &s;ay, the &s;word of the Lord, and of General Green, O inhabitants of South-Carolina, great and &s;mall! rejoice, the Lord has done great things for you, whereof we are glad: therefore, laud and magnify his name for ever.</P>
<P>O Britain! all your intrigues and mo&s;t &s;ecret machin|ations have been wonderfully di&s;covered. An Andre could not bribe, a treacherous and infamous Arnold could not &s;ucceed. O unhappy for America, that thou, O maledict Arnold, ha&s;t e&s;caped her vengeful &s;word! but your puni&s;hment is &s;ure. I will not deviate from my point in view.</P>
<P>Come, my beloved Carolinians, ye who have been bereft of all dome&s;tic happine&s;s; ye who have been di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed in every quarter; ye who have been robbed, plun|dered and &s;poiled, come, rein&s;tate, and po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elves of your invaluable rights, given to your ance&s;tors by the indulgent hand of Heaven.

<P>I am afraid I &s;hall tran&s;gre&s;s upon my readers; but, indulge me a few moments longer. My tongue faulters in the characters I am now about to de&s;cribe. What mu&s;t be done to the loyal &s;ubjects now among&s;t you, who took &s;helter under the tyrannical &s;tandard, and who were &s;ome of the chief promoters of your di&s;tre&s;&s;es.

I leave them in the hands of tho&s;e who hold the reins of govern|ment: if they go unpuni&s;hed, what will be the i&s;&s;ue? Why, the &s;oldier who has been fighting your battles, and hazarded his life in defence of your &s;tate, will look for a high reward.

Let your Con&s;titution be your Magna Charta, your Bill of Rights. Enact good and whole&s;ome laws in your &s;tate; you will make every individual a citizen, and they will be your &s;afeguards, bulwarks, and fortifications: then, when this is done, all the &s;urrounding nations will be a&s;toni&s;hed at your courage, per&s;everance, fortitude, and wi&s;dom; and po&s;terity will read with plea&s;ure, in the annals of your country, your glorious atchievements and warlike actions, and children yet unborn &s;hall &s;ing of America and her warfare. Liberty &s;hall rear her head in the&s;e United States, and oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny &s;hall tremble and hide their heads, and &s;ink into oblivion. The mouth of the loud thundering cannon &s;hall be &s;topped, and the carnage of America by Britain's &s;word, be for ever done away.</P>
<P>Now, ye Carolina Americans, enjoy your&s;elves; yet &s;till be on your guard, until Britain &s;ends this appellation to the United States, of your being the Lords and Rulers of North-America: if there be any among&s;t you like unto Achan, avaricious and treacherous, treat them as Jo&s;hua did him in the valley of Achor. Jo&s;hua vii. 17, 20, and following ver&s;es. O my friends! you will yet be happy in &s;pight of all oppo&s;ition; your &s;tate will yet be a haven for foreign &s;hips, and trade and commerce will come unto
<PB N="16" REF="018182_0014_0FA5BB0D92526630">
you in great abundance; and you &s;hall appear as in the times of old. Come all ye mini&s;ters of God, who have been bani&s;hed your country, return, rea&s;&s;ume your former work in the &s;anctuary, and admini&s;ter in the duties of your &s;acred functions: though the &s;anctuaries have been defiled and corrupted, yet ble&s;s the Lord in them, and with your returning fellow citizens, prai&s;e and magnify him for ever.</P>
<P>O Carolina! have you no worthies to lament, before I conclude? Yes, ye have, though &s;ome long forgotten by many: the remembrance of a Pola&s;ki at Savannah, the death of the amiable and gallant Laurens, mu&s;t dwell near your hearts; he fell a victim to Briti&s;h fury. O noble youth! in the bloom of life, thou native of Carolina, thou who left thy gentle &s;pou&s;e, thy near relation, to cro&s;s the Atlantic, and fight the battles of thy country; we lament thee, O Stono's plain! let no dew or rain fall upon thee, for there the gallant Laurens fell a martyr in defence of his country. Are there no more? Yes, there is the murdered blood of a Lining crying aloud for vengeance. O ye mourning widows and orphan children! cea&s;e to weep, dry up your tears, the Lord will avenge your wrongs. Ye &s;ons of his, perhaps you &s;hall revenge your father's death, as Solomon did the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of his father's reign, though they had caught hold of the horns of the altar. O Haynes! I revere thy character, I pity thy de&s;tiny, thy untimely, and unhappy death: thy lawle&s;s accu&s;ers and murderers, though fled, are not yet out of the reach of the &s;word of ju&s;tice; thy blood crieth aloud for vengeance, and though the enquiry of your execution was expelled a Briti&s;h tribunal, though &s;trenu|ou&s;ly introduced by a Richmond, there remains a higher tribunal, where a Rawdon and a Balfour mu&s;t undoubt|edly appear. O ye orphans of his! Heaven will avenge your father's blood.</P>
<P>Now having imperfectly fini&s;hed the plan fir&s;t laid down, let me conclude as I began, <HI>Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks,</HI> unto thee ought all America to give thanks, <HI>for that thy name has been near unto them, thy wondrous works&punc; declare.</HI> Amen and amen.</P>
