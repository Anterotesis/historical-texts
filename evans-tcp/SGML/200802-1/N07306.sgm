<P>&mdash;And He doth according to His Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Doctrine of univer&s;al Providence is believed and acknowledged by all (I &s;uppo&s;e) who confe&s;s God to be the Creator of the World; and with very good Rea&s;on; for if he made it, it was doubt|le&s;s for &s;ome wi&s;e De&s;igns; and therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould govern it, that his De&s;ign in it may be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The &s;acred Scriptures do every where in&s;truct us to give God the Glory of his pre&s;erving and governing Providence, as well as his creating Power.</P>
<P>He that commanded the World into Being, has cau&s;ed it to continue unto this Day. And as all Things are pre&s;erved by him; &s;o he rules and governs them according to his Will. This Doctrine of the univer&s;al Dominion and Pro|vidence of God is here laid down&mdash;<HI>He doth according to his Will, in the Army of Heaven,
<PB N="6" REF="009331_0004_1030EBF84BAC0D68">
and among the Inhabitants of the Earth</HI>&mdash;a Sub|ject well worthy of our Contemplation; and not un&s;ea&s;onable at this Time.</P>
<P>The &s;urprizing Turns of Providence, and the marvellous Things God has wrought for his People in the Cour&s;e of the late War, which is now bro't to &s;o happy and honourable a Con|clu&s;ion, &s;o intere&s;ting to us in this Land in particular, and which may with Propriety be commemorated on this Day and Occa&s;ion, have determined my Thoughts to this Subject. For <HI>he hath made his wonderful Works to be remem|bered. He has &s;hewed his People the Power of his Works, that he might give them the He|ritage of the Heathen.</HI></P>
<P>Very apparently is the Government and Pro|vidence of God &s;een in the Affairs of War; And not only is Succe&s;s and Victory in Battle, but the bringing of a trouble&s;ome War to a comfortable and advantageous I&s;&s;ue, the Re&s;ult of Providence, which Duty and Gratitude to the &s;upreme Ruler of the World requires us to take Notice of, with Wonder and Thankfulne&s;s. <HI>He maketh Wars to cea&s;e to the End of the Earth,</HI> puts an End to the Wars of the Nations, which had turned the Earth into a Stage of bloody Confu&s;ion, and crowns them with Peace. And this he does <HI>that he may be exalted in the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>This great Truth is confirmed to us not only <HI>by rational Deductions</HI> (as may he &s;hewn here|after) but al&s;o by <HI>many Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> of the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures,</HI> and particularly by the Words be+fore
<PB N="7" REF="009331_0005_1030EBFBD73AE258">
us. They were uttered by <HI>King Nebu|chadnezzar,</HI> one of the mo&s;t <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olute Monarchs</HI> of the World. The God of Heaven had given him a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or <HI>Empire,</HI> abounding in <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Worldly Glories</HI>; and being fixed at the Top of worldly Honors and Greatne&s;s, he would al&s;o be <HI>ab&s;olute and uncontroulable in his Matters, and forgets that there is one above him.</HI> But God would have <HI>the living to know that the Mo&s;t High ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whom&s;oever he will.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Babylon</HI> and his Flatterers con|ceited that he was <HI>God in Earth, independent, and unaccountable to any.</HI> Tho' he might have &s;ome Notion of <HI>a &s;upreme God,</HI> yet he might al&s;o think, as &s;ome of the <HI>Heathen</HI> pretend to believe, that his Government was confined to Heaven: But the great God will have all Men to know that <HI>he rules on Earth too</HI>; that <HI>he &s;ets up, and deba&s;es whom he plea&s;es.</HI> And at la&s;t the <HI>ambitious King</HI> is bro't to acknowledge this to the Glory of God. For becau&s;e he had lived a <HI>bruti&s;h &s;en&s;ual Life,</HI> and becau&s;e he was in Heart lifted up above the <HI>common Race of Mankind</HI>; therefore he was driven from his magnificent <HI>Palace,</HI> and all <HI>Conver&s;e and Society with Men, to herd with Bea&s;ts, and graze with Oxen.</HI> By this &s;trange Turn of Providence, God would teach him this <HI>Le&s;&s;on,</HI> That he is the Giver of all Things; that even Princes are accountable to him; that their <HI>Tenure</HI> is at his Will alone; and that he can alter and alienate the Property of all Enjoyments, <HI>being him&s;elf the ab&s;olute Lord of all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009331_0006_1030EC0042F917D8">This in Conclu&s;ion is freely acknowledged. He who, at la&s;t, thought him&s;elf Supreme on Earth, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed the Mo&s;t High, and prai&s;ed and honoured him that liveth for ever and ever, who&s;e Dominion is an everla&s;ting Dominion, and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation. And all the Inhabitants of the Earth are re|puted as nothing: And he doth according to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>My Text then teaches us, <HI>That the glorious God exerci&s;es an actual Providence over all Things, according to his good Plea&s;ure.</HI>&mdash;He is a great and a univer&s;al King; His <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Government over all Creatures</HI> is <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>unlimitted</HI>: His <HI>Right of Dominion</HI> cannot be di&s;puted; and he <HI>actually</HI> governs and influen|ces all Creatures as &s;eemeth him good. He is the <HI>great Lord</HI> and <HI>In&s;pector</HI> of the Univer&s;e; and that not as an idle and unconcerned <HI>Spec|tator</HI> of the <HI>De&s;igns, Behaviour</HI> and <HI>Actions</HI> of created Beings; but he continually watches over them as their <HI>King, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> and <HI>Ruler,</HI> to lead and determine them to <HI>&s;uch Intentions and Ends</HI> as &s;hall tend mo&s;t to his Glory.&mdash; His Providential Care and Regard is exerci&s;ed towards all; &s;o that the End by him de&s;igned and appointed, &s;hall infallibly be attained.&mdash; He doth <HI>according to his Will, every where, among all Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>There is no earthly Potentate that has &s;o <HI>cer|tainly, ab&s;olutely</HI> and <HI>intirely</HI> the Dominion over, or Di&s;po&s;al of any particular People, or Per&s;on,
<PB N="9" REF="009331_0007_1030EC01D7040B48">
as God has over all <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Things. For his is the Greatne&s;s, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Maje&s;ty: For all that is in the Heaven, and in the Earth is his; and his is the Kingdom, who is exalted as Head above all.</HI></P>
<P>That this important Truth may be &s;et in a ju&s;t Light, We &s;hall endeavour
<LIST>
<ITEM>In the <HI>fir&s;t Place,</HI> To &s;hew what is implied in the Notion of a Providence, or what is intended when God is &s;aid to exerci&s;e a Providence over his Creatures.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> To con&s;ider the great and univer&s;al Extent of his Providential Care and Re|gards. And,</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to con&s;ider what is implied in the Notion of a Providence.&mdash;</P>
<P>God's exerci&s;ing a Providence over his Crea|tures, <HI>principally</HI> intends and implies in it the&s;e <HI>two Things</HI>: His <HI>&s;u&s;taining and upholding Pow|er, whereby the Creatures &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and are conti|nued in actual Being</HI>; and his <HI>governing and di&s;po&s;ing of all Things according to his Will.</HI></P>
<P>It is the <HI>latter of the&s;e</HI> that my Text more e&s;pecially leads to the Con&s;ideration of.</P>
<P>God exerci&s;es his <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> to|wards his Creatures, whereby they are <HI>&s;upported</HI> and <HI>continued</HI> in their <HI>&s;everal di&s;tinct Orders.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="009331_0008_1030EC036731F368">
He does in his Providence continually pre&s;erve the Creation, and keep the &s;everal Parts of it <HI>in that Order of Being</HI> which he at fir&s;t de&s;ign|ed to keep them in. All Creatures, of what <HI>Kind</HI> or <HI>Nature</HI> &s;oever, are upheld in Being by a divine Power. They all live upon God, who is the Fountain of Life to all his Creatures; and therefore frequently &s;tyled, <HI>The living God.</HI></P>
<P>But he not only &s;u&s;tains and keeps his Crea|tures in their Beings; but he always <HI>determines</HI> and <HI>orders</HI> them ju&s;t as he plea&s;es. He has an <HI>actual Influence</HI> over his Creatures, and <HI>governs</HI> them, and <HI>di&s;po&s;es</HI> of them <HI>as &s;eemeth good in his Sight.</HI> He does, as it were, <HI>hold them all in his Hand;</HI> and they are more at his ab&s;o|lute Plea&s;ure and Di&s;po&s;al, than the meane&s;t Worm is at ours. He is a mo&s;t &s;overein Lord, and <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>actually does work all Things af|ter the Council of his own Will</HI>: For he has made all Things for him&s;elf, and <HI>for his Plea|&s;ure they are and were created.</HI> The <HI>Potter</HI> has not more the <HI>Power over the Clay,</HI> than God has over his Creatures&mdash;</P>
<P>It is not only true that &s;overeign <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> belongs to God; but it is cer|tain that he exerci&s;es &s;uch a Power. His Crea|tures are intirely at his <HI>Will</HI>; tho' it be many Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> again&s;t <HI>their own</HI> that they are &s;o.

<PB N="11" REF="009331_0009_1030EC0A79374B08">
There is no <HI>Event of Providence</HI> but what is according to his <HI>Sufferance</HI> or <HI>actual Di&s;po&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;overeign and all wi&s;e Providence of God <HI>&s;teers, directs</HI> and <HI>marriages</HI> all <HI>Creatures</HI> and <HI>Things.</HI> As the whole Creation was made <HI>by Him</HI> and <HI>for Him,</HI> he will take Care and pow|erfully di&s;po&s;e of all Things, &s;o that the Honor of his <HI>holy Name</HI> &s;hall in the End be vindicated and magnified. For this End he &s;uperintends his <HI>Creatures, their Actions</HI> and <HI>Concerns</HI>: and if he plea&s;es, he will re&s;train, or even invert the natural Order of Things. He will <HI>make the Wi&s;dom of the Wi&s;e Fooli&s;hne&s;s. The Battle &s;hall not be to the Strong; nor Favour to Men of Skill.</HI> The <HI>Sun</HI> at his Command at one Time <HI>&s;tands &s;till,</HI> and at another <HI>takes an unnatural Cour&s;e backwards.</HI> The Winds and Seas which are &s;o impetuous, and one would think even Lawle&s;s, yet they &s;tir not, nor breathe, but to fulfil his Word.</P>
<P>And his directive and influencing Providence is as certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his Creatures when they act according to the general Laws of Nature, as when they act in Oppo&s;ition thereto. For, as he certainly knows all their De&s;igns, Incli|nations, and Tendencies; &s;o he can by his Pow|er ea&s;ily di&s;appoint, curb and alter them.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee what is intended by the Provi|dence of God: It is that Influence and Power of his, whereby he not only pre&s;erves and &s;u&s;|tains his Creatures, but governs, re&s;trains and orders them as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="009331_0010_1030EC0DA506CE38">It may be added here, without the Formality of a di&s;tinct Head, The Rule according to which he thus watches over, protects and di&s;|po&s;es of his Creatures, is his own Will "which is always directed by infinite Wi&s;dom, and is the Rule of Goodne&s;s." <HI>He doth according to his Will</HI>&mdash;Nothing be&s;ides is or can be a Rule to him for the Government of the World. His &s;overeign Will is the alone Law by which all Creatures &s;hall be ordered, determined and di&s;po&s;ed. Becau&s;e he is Lord of all, and be|cau&s;e he is Supreme and Independent, therefore he is not accountable to any for any of his Matters. He may do whatever he plea&s;es, <HI>in Heaven, in the Earth, and all deep Places, and none can &s;tay his Hand, or may &s;ay, Wherefore ha&s;t Thou done thus?</HI></P>
<P>There can be nothing binding to God, nor any Thing that can influence him in any of his Operations out of him&s;elf, and beyond his own Will. His Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s alone mu&s;t determine what is holy, ju&s;t and good, and &s;o what is fit to be done in his Kingdom of Providence.</P>
<P>We may now pa&s;s on, and con&s;ider in the <HI>&s;econd Place,</HI> The great and univer&s;al Extent of God's Providential Care and Influence. <HI>He doth according to his Will, in the Army of Hea|ven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth</HI>&mdash; He is the &s;ole univer&s;al Monarch of the World. He is the great Lord and Governor of all Crea|tures and Things, <HI>whether they be in Heaven, or on the Earth, vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible.</HI> As all owe

their Exi&s;tence to him; &s;o they are all, without Exception, under his re&s;training, pre&s;erving and directing Power and Providence. He has <HI>pre|pared his Throne in the Heavens:</HI> but <HI>his King|dom ruleth over all.</HI> Tho' he manife&s;ts much more of his Glory and Excellency there; yet his Dominion is by no Means confined thereto, but it reaches to the utmo&s;t Bounds of the Creation. All Worlds and Creatures are ab&s;o|lutely his: And were there as many more, they would be equally and rightfully under his Au|thority and actual Government.</P>
<P>This might be more fully and clearly evinced by con&s;idering the &s;everal Ranks of Creatures, and Orders of Beings; all which are under the Providential Care and Power of God, and in his Word expre&s;ly &s;aid to be &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P>Good Angels are under the divine Providence and Government. They are the mo&s;t excel|lent and perfect Creatures; and yet are &s;o far from being exempted from his Dominion, that none are more at his Will and Command than they. God exerci&s;ed a &s;pecial Act of Provi|dence towards them, when he made them in their primitive Rectitude and Felicity. And after a &s;ufficient Trial of their Obedience, did for the Prai&s;e of his glorious Grace, confirm them in a State of mo&s;t perfect Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s for ever. This was an Act of &s;overeign Dominion and Providence in God; for they as Creatures are mutable and liable to fall from him, and to forfeit his Favour, as others who actually did apo&s;tatize.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="009331_0012_1030EC10CC4C54A8">And now they are intirely devoted to the di|vine Will and Plea&s;ure. They are readily, chear|fully and con&s;tantly obedient to the Will of God. It is their Delight, and they account it, as indeed it is, their Glory and Honor to adore and wor&s;hip God, and execute his Will. And God makes u&s;e of them as the Mini&s;ters of his Providence, and the Executioners of his Will in this lower World.&mdash; Again,</P>
<P>The evil Angels are under the powerful Re|&s;trains of divine Providence. Tho' they are apo&s;tatized from God, and cannot willingly yield them&s;elves up to his good Plea&s;ure, yet they are his and he will do with them what&s;oever he plea|&s;es, notwith&s;tanding their high Oppo&s;ition again&s;t him, and continual Endeavours to free them|&s;elves and others from any Subjection to his Authority and Will. When they had lo&s;t their original Integrity, and &s;hewn them&s;elves impla|cable Enemies to God, his Glory and Dignity, he ca&s;t them out of Heaven, the Seat of the Ble&s;&s;ed, and plunged them into the Pit of De|&s;truction and Mi&s;ery. And tho' they have now an irreconcilable Enmity in their Natures again&s;t God, his Laws and Government; yet they can effect nothing again&s;t Him. He curbs and re|&s;trains them as he plea&s;es. He holds them as in Chains, and they can go no further than the Limits by him pre&s;cribed. He is able, and does, as he plea&s;es, pull down their &s;tronge&s;t Holds. He binds the &s;trong Man armed, and ca&s;ts him out; de&s;troys his u&s;urped, unlawful Power over the Souls of Men. The Son of
<PB N="15" REF="009331_0013_1030EC19EADF20D0">
God when on Earth &s;hewed &s;uch a divine Pow|er in ejecting him from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Bodies; in not &s;uffering him to &s;peak, and in extorting from him a Confe&s;&s;ion that he was the Son of God.</P>
<P>Tho' evil Spirits are potent, politick, and nu|merous, yet they can't controul divine Provi|dence in the De&s;igns of it. They cannot &s;tay an Omnipotent Hand. They are &s;ecurely re|&s;erved in everla&s;ting Chains under Darkne&s;s to the Judgment of the great Day. The Provi|dence and Power of God watches over, and holds them in Horror and Mi&s;ery. They are as condemned Malefactors, bound over to the la&s;t Judgment, when final Vengeance &s;hall come upon them. And even now their evil De|&s;ires and mi&s;chievous De&s;igns are re&s;trained by a &s;uperior Power.</P>
<P>Furthermore,</P>
<P>God exerci&s;es his ab&s;olute Dominion and &s;overeign Providence over Men on Earth. The Affairs of the World in general are ordered and determined by Him. His is the King|dom, and he is the Governor among the Nati|ons. His Eyes are in every Place, and he ob|&s;erves all Things with the mo&s;t perfect, exact and critical View. And he has an actual In|fluence in all human Affairs and Concerns.</P>
<P>Particular Nations and Kingdoms are under his Care and providential Rule, and the Civil, Military and Secular, as well as religious and &s;piritual Intere&s;ts of a People are either oppo&s;|ed and lo&s;t, or e&s;tabli&s;hed and promoted accord|ing to his Permi&s;&s;ion and Will.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009331_0014_1030EC1B79D684C0">He puts the Admini&s;tration of Government into what Hands he plea&s;es; for all the &s;ub|ordinate Powers that be are ordained of God, or at lea&s;t &s;uffered by him. <HI>Promotion cometh neither from the Ea&s;t, nor from the We&s;t, nor from the South, but God is the Judge, he put|teth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>The Kingdoms and Dominions of the World are his, and he giveth them to whom he will. All humane Power is derived from him, who&s;e Power and Authority is univer&s;al, infinite and adorable. The greate&s;t Potentates of the Earth, who have been ready to imagine them&s;elves &s;overeign and independent, are neverthele&s;s un|der his powerful Influence, and are by him made to &s;ub&s;erve his Intere&s;t and Glory, when their very De&s;ign was to contradict and oppo&s;e it. That proud and potent King of <HI>Babylon, who&s;e Greatne&s;s reached unto Heaven, and his Dominion to the End of the Earth; all Nati|ons trembled before Him; whom he would he &s;lew, and whom he would he kept alive;</HI> yet even he, this Child of Pride, is made to con|fe&s;s one higher than him&s;elf, and to bow be|fore him.</P>
<P>And this is what every one &s;hall finally be made to do. For, the mo&s;t High actually rules in the Kingdoms of this World, and determines the Concerns of particular States and People, according to his own Will and Wi&s;dom. <HI>He &s;tands in the Congregation of the Mighty, and judges among the Gods.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009331_0015_1030EC1D119F0C20">Suffer me particularly to ob&s;erve here, that whatever the Circum&s;tances of a Per&s;on of Peo|ple are, they are put into &s;uch Circum&s;tances either in the Cour&s;e of God's common Provi|dence, or by &s;ome unu&s;ual Events. For God has the ordering and government both of na|tural and accidental Cau&s;es and Events.</P>
<P>Hardly any Thing happens to Men, in the ordinary Cour&s;e of their Lives, but what, if heed|fully attended to, may teach them that there is a wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good Providence, which directs and manages tho&s;e natural Things, which are the immediate Cau&s;es of their Pro&s;perity, or of their Sorrow and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>God does in &s;ome Mea&s;ure govern the Moral, by the World of Nature. He rewards or pu|ni&s;hes Men by a whole&s;ome or pe&s;tilential Air; by fruitful or barren Sea&s;ons. He hinders or promotes their De&s;igns by Wind and Weather; by a backward or forward Spring. He makes Nature give Laws to Men, and &s;et Bounds to their Pa&s;&s;ions and Intrigues. How often does he by natural Cau&s;es, overthrow powerful Fleets and Armies, defeat the wi&s;e&s;t Coun&s;els, arbitrate the Differences of Princes, and decide the Fate of Kingdoms! Now if God thus go|verns Men by Nature, he mu&s;t govern Nature too. For nece&s;&s;ary cannot be &s;uited to the De&s;igns and Endeavours of free Agents, with|out the Influence of a wi&s;e Providence.</P>
<P>God al&s;o has the Government of accidental Cau&s;es and Events. The outward Peace and Comfort, or Mi&s;ery of Men, of Families, and
<PB N="18" REF="009331_0016_1030EC244AE346F8">
&s;ometimes of whole Kingdoms, depends upon &s;omething accidental. So that if God did not rule &s;uch Things, &s;ome of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable Changes in the World, would be excepted from his Care and Providence.</P>
<P>Men lay their Schemes as well as they can, and Providence &s;eems to favour them too; but by &s;ome &s;ecret Cau&s;e, their Devices are all di&s;|appointed, and their Coun&s;els carried headlong&mdash;</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the mo&s;t unlikely Means &s;hall &s;ometimes attain the End. A People &s;hall be rai&s;ed to worldly Glories by a &s;urprizing Cour&s;e of Events, as accidental as they are pro&s;|perous. Does not &s;ome wonderful Turn of Providence &s;ometimes highly favour Men, even contrary to all human Probability?</P>
<P>Again, Some ca&s;ual Occurrences fru&s;trate the mo&s;t proper Means, and give an unexpected Turn to the Intere&s;ts of Men. What &s;hould conquer in a Race, but Swiftne&s;s? What &s;hould win the Battle, but Strength, and Valor, and Mar&s;hal Skill? What &s;hould &s;upply Men's wants, and get Riches, but Under&s;tanding and Dili|gence in human Affairs? What more likely Way to gain the Favour of others, than a &s;kil|ful Addre&s;s?

<P>Now, however fortuitou&s;ly Things may hap|pen, they are brought to pa&s;s by a divine Effici|ency; and there is &s;ome wi&s;e De&s;ign in them.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="009331_0017_1030EC2800005208">Many Things befall us which we never looked for, and could not fore&s;ee. The&s;e are what we call Contingencies, or Accidents. But with Re&s;pect to God, there can be no &s;uch Thing as Chance. For as he foreknows tho&s;e Events, which to us are mo&s;t uncertain and &s;ur|pri&s;ing; &s;o he actually governs them.</P>
<P>But I may not enlarge.</P>
<P>The various Succe&s;&s;ions of Peace and War, War and Peace are from Him. The De&s;ola|tions of War, and the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace are ordered by Him. War is the Sword of the Lord, which he draws and &s;heaths again at his Plea&s;ure. When he &s;ees fit he di&s;turbs the Re|po&s;e of the Nations, and calls oppo&s;ing Armies into the Field of Battle, where cla&s;hing Swords, and Garments rolled in Blood, open a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and melancholly Scene.&mdash;And then, when the War has accompli&s;hed that for which it was &s;ent, he compo&s;es the Belligerent Powers to Peace,
<Q>calls off the Nations from oppo&s;ing and de&s;troying one another, and di&s;bands the mo&s;t furious Armies.</Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t indeed be allowed that War origi|nates in the Lu&s;ts of Men, and Princes; and that their Pride, Envy, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Affectation of undue Dominion, &amp;c. are the &s;econdary Cau&s;es of its Ri&s;e; and all the Horrors that attend it.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s there is an over-ruling Hand of Providence, di&s;po&s;ing and ordering the exact Time of its Beginning, Continuance, and Conclu&s;ion&mdash;as well as the great and im|portant Events of it.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="009331_0018_1030EC2B22025450">Moreover,</P>
<P>God in his Providence cares, provides for, and governs particular Per&s;ons. Tho' the uni|ver&s;al World be under his con&s;tant In&s;pection, yet no particular Soul is neglected by him. He has as much Re&s;pect to every individual Per&s;on, as to the greate&s;t Man upon Earth, or the World in general. So un&s;earchable is the Wi&s;|dom of God, and &s;o unlimited his Power, as that he can and actually does know the State of every Man, and rules and governs him ac|cordingly.&mdash;</P>
<P>All Men, both Good and Bad, are particu|larly re&s;pected by him, and either &s;ucceeded or bla&s;ted in their Enterprizes, according to his Will. Yea,</P>
<P>He has an Influence into the particular Ac|tions of particular Per&s;ons. Every good Action is performed by his efficacious Power, and the immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Grace.</P>
<P>And even evil Actions are done by his &s;pe|cial Permi&s;&s;ion. He &s;uffers them to be per|formed, and yet, by his Providence, &s;o directs and over-rules them, as that they will in the Con|clu&s;ion make for his own Glory.</P>
<P>In a Word,</P>
<P>The Providence of God extends it&s;elf to the meane<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> and mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Creatures. They are not without the Limits of divine Pro|vidence and Care. Yea, the very Hairs of our Head are all numbred by him. Divine Provi|dence reaches to the mo&s;t minute Things, and influences the mo&s;t invaluable Beings in the

World. In &s;hort, it reaches to the utmo&s;t Bounds of the Creation, and extends to all Things.</P>
<P>We ha&s;ten now in the third and la&s;t Place, to con&s;ider what rea&s;onable Grounds we have to conclude, that God does actually exerci&s;e &s;uch a Providence.</P>
<P>It is certain we have &s;ufficient Grounds of A&s;&s;urance to found our Belief upon, even from the frequent and expre&s;s Te&s;timony of the Word of God. He is there &s;aid to be an in|finite and an all-comprehending Being. All Power, and Might and Dominion is a&s;cribed to him. <HI>His Name is excellent in all the Earth; his Glory is above the Heavens. Of him, and thro' him, and to him&punc; are all Things.</HI> He is the great and mighty God. The Lord of Ho&s;ts is his Name. Great in Coun&s;el, and mighty in working. The God of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h, and nothing is too hard for him. <HI>He forms the Light, and he creates Darkne&s;s: he makes Peace, and creates Evil; the Lord does all the&s;e Things. To whom can we liken him, for he is God: his Coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and he will do all his Plea&s;ure. He alone is God, and there is none with him. He kills and he makes alive; he wounds and he heals&punc; neither is there any that can deliver out of his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>It were ea&s;y, but it is needle&s;s to multiply Texts of this Nature and Import, wherein the Excellency, and Maje&s;ty, the Greatne&s;s and Glory, the Sovereignty and Providence of God are a&s;&s;erted, and &s;et forth, in the be&s;t Manner that Words of human Eloquence will allow.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="009331_0020_1030EC2E69621208">There are further many rational Grounds to believe the all-di&s;po&s;ing Providence of God.</P>
<P>As his eternal Godhead, almighty Power&punc; and infinite Wi&s;dom, are manife&s;ted to his rational and intelligent Creatures; &s;o they may al&s;o rea|&s;onably infer his active Providence and conti|nually influencing Power over all the Works of his Hands. There is ju&s;t Rea&s;on to believe that God rules and governs all his Creatures, and all their Actions.</P>
<P>This may be argued from his creating all Things for him&s;elf. That God is the Maker of all Things, is as true as that he is God. For except we allow him to be the original Cau&s;e, the Creator and Former of all Things, we &s;hall by Con&s;equence deny him to be the only &s;elf-exi&s;ting, and independent Being. If any Thing could exi&s;t and act without him, then he is not the all-perfect Being: and &s;o not truly God.</P>
<P>It therefore mu&s;t, and ea&s;ily will be granted, that in the Beginning God made the Heavens and the Earth; and that without him was not any Thing made that was made; that all with|in the Limits of the Creation, from the mo&s;t glorious Angel to the meane&s;t In&s;ect; yea, to the lea&s;t Atom of Du&s;t, was commanded into Being by his all-powerful Word.</P>
<P>And as all Things were made by him, &s;o for him. He hath made all Things for him&s;elf. His own Glory was the principal and la&s;t End in all his Works of Creation. In whatever God does, his only Rule is his own Will, and his End is the Manife&s;tation of his glorious Excellencies.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="009331_0021_1030EC38B71ED318">Now, &s;ee if this Con&s;ideration will not ne|ce&s;&s;arily infer his providential Rule and Govern|ment over all Things? Can any Man believe God the Creator of all Things, and acknow|ledge, as every one mu&s;t do, that he made all for him&s;elf; and yet di&s;believe his actual Power and Providence over all? It cannot certainly be beneath the Maje&s;ty of God to regard and take Care of the meane&s;t Creatures, &s;ince it was not unworthy of him to exert his almighty Power in giving them Being at fir&s;t. And it mu&s;t certainly be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Wi&s;dom of God to create &s;uch a Variety of Beings for his own Glory, and then intirely de&s;ert them, and take no Care that the End were actually attained.</P>
<P>We may be a&s;&s;ured, that &s;ince God made all Things for the Di&s;play of his glorious Per|fections in them, he will &s;o re&s;train, direct and influence them, as that this End &s;hall certainly be &s;ecured.</P>
<P>If God be the Maker of all Things, and his own Honor was his End therein; then he is the Lord and &s;overeign Di&s;po&s;er of all. This is a plain and undeniable Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Nor is it any rea&s;onable Objection again&s;t this, that a Multitude of the mo&s;t excellent Crea|tures, Angels and Men, have fallen from their original State of Perfection, and are now be|come unwilling and unable actively to glorify God. For he by his Power can, and in his Providence actually does &s;o over-rule them and their Actions, as that the great End &s;hall be ob|tained. For <HI>God will be glorified in them that

peri&s;h, as well as in them that are &s;aved</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add,</P>
<P>A divine Providence may be argued from Miracles, or Works above the Power of natu|ral Agents. Tho&s;e Operations and Events which exceed the meer Force and Power of Nature, will nece&s;&s;arily infer &s;ome &s;uperior and mo&s;t powerful Being, who interpo&s;es when he plea&s;es, and hinders or inverts the natural Cour&s;e and Tendency of the Creatures.</P>
<P>That there have been &s;uch extraordinary Works or Events, we have all po&s;&s;ible Rea&s;on to believe. He that will n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> give his A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of &s;uch Facts, becau&s;e he was never an Eye-witne&s;s of them, may, as well, and with as much Rea&s;on, re&s;olve to believe nothing at all, but what he has had a Per&s;onal Knowledge of.</P>
<P>Allowing then that there have been &s;uch mi|raculous Works as never could have been effec|ted but by a divine Power, We may be a&s;&s;ured that God exerci&s;es a &s;overeign Power and Pro|vidence over the World; that he acts his Will and Plea&s;ure among all Creatures; that he per|mits them to act, or ob&s;tructs and hinders ac|cording to his Will. If he did not watch over and govern the World, to what can we impute tho&s;e wonderful and miraculous Things which we find recorded in the Scriptures of Truth? They were manife&s;tly contrary to the known e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of Nature. And it would be unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that they were effected by evil, but powerful Spirits, to put a Cheat up|on Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="009331_0023_1030EC3C30D845C0">The manife&s;t De&s;ign of them was to glorify God, and to promote the Holine&s;s and Hap|pine&s;s of Men. They mu&s;t therefore be wro't by the Finger of God; and they prove his Power and Providence over his Creatures&mdash;</P>
<P>The Truth under Con&s;ideration might be further evidenced from God's frequent re&s;train|ing and &s;ubduing the Lu&s;ts of Men. The&s;e are &s;o many Miracles of Grace, and &s;o many Evidences of God's adorable Power, and &s;ove|reign Providence. For if &s;ome Almighty Hand did not continually hold in, and re&s;train the inordinate Lu&s;ts of Men and Devils, this World would, before now, have been an Habitation of Cruelty, and a mere Hell of Confu&s;ion and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>What we have now heard under this Head, without further in&s;i&s;ting upon it, may give us a rational Conviction of the Truth we have been con&s;idering, viz. That God exerci&s;es a power|ful Providence over all his Creatures, according to his Will.</P>
<P>And now, from what has been offered, let us in the fir&s;t Place learn to adore the infinite Maje&s;ty and Greatne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>How excellent, great, and glorious a Being is he, who thus rules, di&s;po&s;es, and governs all Things! What an exalted Idea does this give us of the divine Maje&s;ty, to think that he is a King, ab&s;olutely Sovereign, univer&s;al and eternal! Of how glorious and adorable Per|fections mu&s;t that God be; and with how glo|rious a Maje&s;ty mu&s;t he be cloathed, who can
<PB N="26" REF="009331_0024_1030EC3FBAB41380">
thus in&s;pect and order the Univer&s;e as he plea&s;es!</P>
<P>What Authority and Power is he inve&s;ted with, who&s;e is the Heavens, and the Earth, and all that therein is, and who has all Crea|tures at his &s;ole Command, and intire Di&s;po&s;al! How great a God is he! How greatly to be feared and had in Reverence!</P>
<P>He mu&s;t needs be entitled to all Honor and Wor&s;hip, who has a nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;putable Right of Dominion over all. He who is Lord of all, is worthy to receive all Ble&s;&s;ing and Glory from all Creatures, according to their &s;everal Abilities. It is the obliged Duty of all his rea&s;onable Creatures to adore him and mag|nify his Name, who is the exalted King and Head over all.</P>
<P>Earthly Princes and Governors will be re&s;|pected, honoured and obeyed by tho&s;e who are lawfully &s;ubjected to their Authority. And by how much they exceed in Health and world|ly Glories, and in the extent of their Dominions, a proportionably greater Honor will be chal|lenged by them. The Re&s;pect and Honor which is paid them ri&s;es in Proportion to their outward Magnificence and worldly Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>What Glory, Adoration and Prai&s;e then is due to God, the univer&s;al King and Governor, who&s;e Authority and Power is mo&s;t ju&s;t and rightful; and who has all Things at his Will and good Plea&s;ure? We have all po&s;&s;ible Rea&s;on to make him the highe&s;t Object of our E&s;teem, Fear and Reverence. Shall not the Excellency of &s;o glorious a Being make us afraid&punc; Shall

not a holy Awe and Dread of the almighty King fall upon us? Shall a finite Creature, to whom is given &s;ome worldly Power, be regarded and reverenced by us; and &s;hall not the infinite God, who has all Power and Authority, be much more &s;o? It is only for the Sake of that derived Power wherewith Earthly Rulers are inve&s;ted, that we honor and obey them?

<P>How glorious is God our heavenly King! And how reveren<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ial, humble and obedient &s;hould we be to a Being, great and powerful as he is! He ju&s;tly demands, and it is our rea&s;on|able Duty, to pay all Wor&s;hip, Homage and Prai&s;e to him, who is all in all; who by an underived Authority, and an irre&s;i&s;tible Power, over-rules all Creatures for his own Glory.</P>
<P>That which naturally flows from this Doc|trine, is that of the in&s;pired P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>O come, let us wor&s;hip, and bow down!</HI> We &s;hould en|tertain high and honourable Thoughts of him&punc; and fall low before the high and lofty One&mdash;</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Let what has been &s;aid excite us to a &s;erious Contemplation on God's Works of Providence, and to give him the Glory of his Wi&s;dom, Power, Goodne&s;s, and other Ex|cellencies

that are therein manife&s;ted. This is one main Bu&s;ine&s;s of our pre&s;ent State, as we are under&s;tanding and thoughtful Creatures. And it is no improbable Opinion that &s;ome Part of our Employment in Heaven will be to contemplate the Works of God, as well as his eternal E&s;&s;ence, and to render him the Prai&s;e which re&s;ults from both.</P>
<P>As the Glory of God is vi&s;ible in the Cre|ation of the World, &s;o he makes known his Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, his Power, Ju&s;tice and Mercy in the Government of it. The Word of God (as we have heard) teaches us to be|lieve that all Creatures are pre&s;erved and govern|ed by the &s;ame almighty Hand which at fir&s;t gave them Being. That he by whom they at fir&s;t exi&s;ted keeps them in their &s;everal Orders, Operations and Motions, and that nothing hap|pens either in the common Cour&s;e of Nature, or in extraordinary Events without his Know|ledge and Determination. In a Word, that he is ever pre&s;ent with all his Creatures, and that even the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable of them are not excepted out of his Dominion and Government. It is the Duty of rea&s;onable Creatures to live under a due Sen&s;e of this Providence. Nor is it enough that we retain the general Notion and Belief of it in our Minds, but &s;hould take Care to apply it to particular Events. For if God knows and orders every Thing that hap|pens to our&s;elves and others, to Nations and Kingdoms, it mu&s;t be the Duty of his People to acknowledge him in all.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="009331_0027_1030EC4987F26C80">We &s;hould often meditate, with &s;uitable Af|fections, on the glorious In&s;tances of his Pow|er, his Goodne&s;s, and his Grace, his un&s;earch|able Wi&s;dom, and his Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which appear in the Admini&s;tration of his Go|vernment of rational Beings.</P>
<P>The Di&s;per&s;ions of Nations over the Face of the Earth, the Ri&s;e of Empires, and the Fate of Kingdoms, as to outward Circum&s;tances or &s;pi|ritual Privileges, are according to the Appoint|ment of God, and the Influence of his Power.</P>

<P>Gratitude to God for favourable Di&s;pen&s;ati|ons of Providence, is &s;o rational a Duty, that they who regard nothing but their precious En|joyments, without any &s;erious Remembrance of God, are, not only lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of Religion, but even to the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Apprehen&s;ions and Affections of human Nature.</P>
<P>Let us then a&s;cribe the Glory of all the Sal|vations and Deliverences, which the Church and People of God have had Experience of, from Time to Time, to him who doth according to his Will, in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth.

And ble&s;&s;ed be God that &s;uch a joyful Aera now &s;hines forth upon us in <HI>America;</HI> and that we may <HI>&s;it every Man under his Vine and under his Figtree, having none to make us afraid</HI>&mdash;or to di&s;turb us in the Enjoyment either of the Fruits of the Earth, or our more precious and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Privileges, both of a Religious and Civil Nature.</P>
<P>But is War bro't to an happy Conclu&s;ion? And do the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace &s;mile around us? Shall we therefore now <HI>beat our Swords into Plow&s;hares, and our Spears into Pruning Hooks</HI>; and lay a&s;ide our military Weapons as u&s;ele&s;s Things, which we &s;hall never more have Occa|&s;ion for, and give up all Endeavours to be ac|quainted with the Art of War, and to keep up a martial Spirit?&mdash;How impolitic; how un&s;afe; how di&s;honorable &s;uch a Conduct! Who knows how &s;oon he that hath &s;tilled the Tumult of the People at pre&s;ent, may again call to Arms? We cannot but remember that it was but a few Years after the late Peace in 1748 was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the Flames of War extingui&s;hed, before they broke out again.</P>
<P>The Church's Enemies are ever re&s;tle&s;s; and tho' God is above all the Enemies of his Peo|ple, and is able to curb their Power and re&s;train their Malice;&mdash;yet have we not Rea&s;on to fear that the abounding of Iniquity in the Prote&s;tant World, may provoke God &s;oon again to cha&s;tize his People with the Puni&s;hment of the Sword.</P>
<P>Is it not the Wi&s;dom of a People to be al|ways in a Po&s;ture of Defence?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="009331_0033_1030EC5D8EFDFF58">Among the various Changes of human Af|fairs, the different and oppo&s;ite Events that do interchangeably &s;ucceed in the Cour&s;e of human Life, for which the Royal Preacher tells us, There is a Time and Sea&s;on, tho&s;e that do more eminently affect Nations and Kingdoms are a Time of War, and a Time of Peace. The&s;e take their Turns in their appointed Sea&s;ons, which is (as one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> in his Artillery Election Sermon 173<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> ob&s;erves) an Admonition to us, that as War mu&s;t be managed with Views of Peace, &s;o a Time of Peace mu&s;t be improv|ed to prepare for War.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t of Men and Monarchs, tho' in his Days &s;uch a Peace flouri&s;hed&punc; that it is &s;aid, there was <HI>no Adver&s;ary or evil Oc|current,</HI> yet who made greater Preparation for War than he? And the Scripture &s;peaks of it to his Commendation.</P>
<P>Skilful and brave Soldiers are ever the Beau|ty and Glory, and under God, the Safety and Defence of a People.</P>
<P>And I may be allowed on this Occa&s;ion par|ticularly to &s;ay that the Gentlemen of the <HI>ancient and honourable Company of the Artillery,</HI> &s;hould be encouraged in their Endeavours to keep up a martial Spirit, and to acquire and propagate Skill and Expertne&s;s in the U&s;e of Arms. And we tru&s;t they are &s;o, and will be &s;o by <HI>His Excellency</HI> the <HI>Captain-General,</HI> by the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> and by all that wi&s;h well to the real Intere&s;ts of this People.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="009331_0034_1030EC64E51827A0">His EXCELLENCY, and our other honoured Rulers, who are plea&s;ed to grace the&s;e Anniver|&s;aries with their Pre&s;ence, and Attendance on the Exerci&s;es of divine Service, u&s;ual on &s;uch Days, &s;urely, do hereby &s;ignify their Approba|tion of the De&s;ign of the In&s;titution of this Company, as valuable, and of real Benefit to the Community.</P>
<P>Our Fathers who laid the Foundation of this E&s;tabli&s;hment, tho't it of Importance. Nor will it be an Argument of our &s;uperior Wi&s;|dom to di&s;&s;ert the Cau&s;e they were &s;o anxious to &s;upport.</P>
<P>Have we not &s;een the Importance of well di&s;ciplined Troops in the late War? And &s;hall we that have known the great Utility and Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of expert and valiant Soldiers, not be concerned to have &s;uch found among our&s;elves, who might be able to force regular Forces upon equal Grounds, and not be afraid to &s;peak with the Enemy in the Gate?</P>
<P>Well accompli&s;h'd and &s;kilful Soldiers will be more than ever nece&s;&s;ary for us in any future War that may ari&s;e, as &s;uch will be tho&s;e, in all Probability, whom we &s;hall chiefly have to deal with.&mdash;</P>
<P>As the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Peace upon &s;uch glorious Terms cannot but diffu&s;e Joy thro' the Minds of all that wi&s;h well to Zion, and are the real Friends of the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e&punc; &s;o we all bear our Part in grateful Acknowledgments to the &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er of all Events, who hath the Hearts of the Princes and Potentates
<PB N="37" REF="009331_0035_1030EC66A0E0DEC0">
of the Earth in his Hand, for this gracious Di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;o much in Favour to the Briti&s;h Governments in <HI>America,</HI> and to this Province in particular.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it becomes us all, and Per&s;ons of a military Character will e&s;pecially remem|ber, that the Time may come even in our Days, &s;uch is the In&s;tability of human Affairs, when tho&s;e who envy our growing Greatne&s;s, may form deep Plots again&s;t us, and endeavour to put them in Execution by the Point of the Sword. Is it not then our Wi&s;dom even in a Time of Peace to prepare for War, and cheri&s;h a martial Spirit, that we may be in a ready Po&s;ture of Defence on the Turn of Affairs?</P>
<P>Altho' the peculiar Smiles of Providence which attend this anniver&s;ary Solemnity, in&s;pire Joy and Gratitude into all our Hearts, yet we feel our Sorrow and Mourning renewed for the Decea&s;e of the late worthy Colonel PHILLIPS, who was &s;o long an Ornament to the <HI>Artillery Company,</HI> as well as a great Ble&s;&s;ing in the other various public Stations which he filled with Honor, Fidelity and Acceptance. But he is gone! Gone to be here no more! His Piety, Integrity, Benevolence, and exten&s;ive Kindne&s;s and Goodne&s;s, afforded him &s;olid Comfort at the Approach of the la&s;t Enemy, and Victory over him. He quitted the Field of Battle with Honor; and we doubt not knows by happy Experience the Import of that gracious Procla|mation and Promi&s;e of our divine Commander, <HI>To him that overcometh will I grant to &s;et with
<PB N="38" REF="009331_0036_1030EC6A93C54780">
me on my Throne, even as I al&s;o overcame and am &s;et down with my Father on his Throne.</HI></P>
<P>We, my Brethren, mu&s;t ere long engage in the &s;ame Combat, <HI>for there is no Di&s;charge in that War;</HI> and the Body will fall and die in the Conflict, and Death feed on its pro&s;trate Prey in the Grave.</P>
<P>May we, may all in this A&s;&s;embly of what|ever Character and Condition in Life, be con|cerned that we may be prepared for this la&s;t Scene of Life, and the Beginning of a new, and never-ending State. This is the chief Bu|&s;ine&s;s of Life, which if neglected we are eter|nally ruined. To this End let us believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST, fly for Refuge to his atoning Sacrifice, &s;ubmit to him as the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, yield Obedience to his Com|mands as the Captain of our Salvation, and live in the faithful Di&s;charge of the Duties of our &s;everal Stations.</P>
<P>Let us look to him, <HI>in whom it hath plea&s;ed the Father that all Fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell,</HI> for Grace and Strength to enable us to pro&s;ecute our Chri&s;tian Warfare amid&s;t our &s;urrounding and powerful Enemies, with Courage and Re&s;o|lution, and to pu&s;h on with Patience and Bra|very to the final Conque&s;t; that when our War|fare &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, and Death &s;hall di&s;|charge us from the Fatigues and Turmoils of this tran&s;itory Life, we may put on the Garland of Immortality, and live and reign with our victorious Redeemer, in the Realms of a glori|ous and undi&s;turbed Peace, thro' the endle&s;s Ages of Eternity. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
