<BIBL>II. SAMUEL, xxi. 17.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>THEN THE MEN OF DAVID SWARE UNTO HIM, SAY|ING, THOU SHALT GO NO MORE OUT WITH US TO BATTLE, THAT THOU QUENCH NOT THE LIGHT OF ISRAEL.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>"TRULY light is &s;weet, and a plea&s;ant thing it is for the eyes to behold the &s;un." This great &s;ource of light was early formed by the Creator's hand. "He &s;aw that it was good." It has ever &s;ince been the beauty and the glory of its &s;y&s;tem. Its mo&s;t exten&s;ive beneficence is as nece&s;&s;ary, as its &s;plendor is illu&s;trious. It is e&s;&s;ential to the gladne&s;s, the guidance, and the &s;upport of the various inhabitants of the globe. It is peculiarly the life and the beauty of the vegetative cre|ation. By this the enamelled meads are dre&s;&s;ed in their riche&s;t robes, "&s;urpa&s;&s;ing SOLOMON in all his glory."</P>
<P>With great wi&s;dom then and propriety, did the men of I&s;rael u&s;e the delicate and &s;trong figure of light,
<PB N="6" REF="035317_0005_10022B706871D608">
to give an idea of the &s;plendor and benignity of their ruling Sovereign. The two principal ideas contained in this metaphor, are beams to <HI>guide,</HI> and rays to <HI>cheer;</HI> or, guidance and comfort. When applied to a ju&s;t and good thing, it &s;ignifies that he governs with <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and to the joy and <HI>felicity</HI> of his &s;ubjects. DAVID him&s;elf u&s;es the &s;ame &s;plendid figure, in the &s;en&s;e of the text. "He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of GOD; and he &s;hall be as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even a morn|ing without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining after rain."</P>
<P>The men of I&s;rael, wi&s;er than many in this day, duly appreciated the ble&s;&s;ings of good government, and highly tendered the precious life of their &s;overeign. They trembled at his per&s;onal danger. They blodly oppo&s;ed his de&s;ign of going to battle again&s;t his rebel|lious &s;on, and prevented his expo&s;ure of him&s;elf. They an&s;wered with all the fervor of love, and the firmne&s;s of patrioti&s;m: "Thou &s;halt not go forth: For if we flee away, they will not care for us: Neither if half of us die, will they care for us: But thou art worth ten thou&s;and of us." What noble &s;entiments are the&s;e! And what &s;terling worth! It was for a like cau&s;e, and on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, that they &s;pake the words of our text.</P>
<P>DAVID had wearied him&s;elf in battle, and &s;pent his &s;trength. A gigantic foe &s;aw his advantage, and had nearly improved it, and taken his life. ABISHAI, one of his Generals, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pre&s;ence of mind, &s;tepped in a moment between his prince and death; &s;aved him from the hands of his huge antagoni&s;t, and gave the mon&s;ter the fatal thru&s;t. On that great occa&s;ion, "his men," with equal rea&s;on, "Sware to him," &s;aying, "Thou &s;halt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of I&s;rael." How happy is &s;uch a prince! How ble&s;&s;ed is &s;uch a People! Could I do any thing, which &s;hould promote &s;uch happine&s;s, I &s;hould &s;urely be happy too.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035317_0006_10022B774E4CFED8">
I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould do but little to this purpo&s;e, were I to &s;pend time to prove that civil government is a nece&s;|&s;ary in&s;titution, evident from the nature and circum|&s;tances of mankind; that it is agreeable to the will of the Supreme Ruler of the world; and that it may be ad|mini&s;tered in &s;uch a manner as to be of very various and exten&s;ive benefit to &s;ociety. There is, I conceive, as little rea&s;on to induce me to &s;how the comparative ex|cellencies and defects of the &s;everal forms of govern|ment, which different nations have adopted. By the help of all the&s;e, the union has formed con&s;titutions, perhaps, the mo&s;t excellent and eligible of any yet thought of. To offer to our Rulers of this State, with mode&s;ty, and yet with zeal, &s;ome plain directions for an happy admini&s;tration of our public affairs, is the bu&s;ine&s;s before us; with the re&s;ulting duties of the People.</P>
<P>If Rulers would be the light and joy of the People, it is e&s;&s;ential that they bear a kind and parental <HI>affection</HI> to them. This is a principle animating and per&s;evering, and e&s;&s;ential to a joyful activity in duty. Civil Rulers are in a &s;tation exalted and important. The con&s;equen|ces of their conduct are of a very &s;erious and weighty nature, deeply affecting the intere&s;ts of the community; while they are &s;eeking the welfare of the People, affairs may come before them of a very perplexed and intricate nature, calling for their united wi&s;dom, probity and pa|tience. At the &s;ame time, their unwearied and laboring &s;ervices may not receive from the People that approba|tion, which they merit. The be&s;t mea&s;ures of their ad|mini&s;tration may be di&s;approved and blamed, and cen|&s;ured as wrong; neither calculated, nor even de&s;igned for the public good.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e and &s;imilar circum&s;tances, how nece&s;&s;ary is that love of the People, which flows from a regard to GOD, and chri&s;tian principles! Here Rulers mu&s;t ri&s;e above pre&s;ent con&s;iderations, and act agreeably to their &s;tations, and as accountable to GOD. They mu&s;t view them&s;elves as the Fathers of the People appointed by
<PB N="8" REF="035317_0007_10022B7F311DA778">
GOD, and rea&s;on to take care of their intere&s;ts, and promote their welfare; although they &s;hould prove unthankful children, perverted by ignorant men; or &s;uch as are re&s;tle&s;s, di&s;contented and &s;editious. Know|ing that they are "mini&s;ters of GOD for good" to the People, they mu&s;t attend to that very thing. And a &s;incere aim to promote that, animated by benevolence, &s;hould never be neglected a moment. A de&s;ire to be u&s;eful, and ble&s;s mankind, &s;hould rule in the hearts of all; men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;tation and influence of Rulers, &s;hould greatly cheri&s;h it. They cannot rule us in the fear of GOD without it.</P>
<P>But, animated by this, and guided by wi&s;dom, they will &s;hine in their influence, as the &s;un in the firma|ment; and enlighten and cheer all who have eyes to &s;ee, and &s;en&s;ibility to feel. And they may always hope this number will be large, notwith&s;tanding all the jeal|ous and unea&s;y men, who grow up &s;pontaneou&s;ly in free governments. Many will &s;ay of &s;uch Rulers, "They are the glory and &s;tability of our times." Even in this day of jarring politics, we have Rulers of whom we &s;ay, "Ye are worth ten thou&s;and of us." We have our NEHEMIAHS, for whom we pray, "LORD blot not out all their good deeds which they have done for thy people, and for the hou&s;es of our GOD." We have our MORDECAI's, who are "great in the nation, and accepted of the multitude of their brethren, &s;eeking the wealth of the People, and &s;peak|ing peace to all their feed." All Rulers &s;hould be like the&s;e, and become the light and gladne&s;s of the People.</P>
<P><HI>Great knowledge</HI> of the nature and duties of govern|ment is another part of that genial light, by which Ru|lers &s;hine, and give the People joy. This, with a connected and competent acquaintance with human nature, is e&s;&s;ential, if they would rule with honor to them&s;elves, and advantage to the People. Should the People &s;ee that they are ignorant, or neglectful, of the Con&s;titution, and the principal rules of admini&s;tration,
<PB N="9" REF="035317_0008_10022B816F222980">
they would view them as a luminary under an eclip&s;e, &s;hedding a tenebrious and portentous light. But, while they duly regard both the&s;e with a prudent reference to the genius and &s;entiments of the People, they will &s;hine with a plea&s;ing and acceptable &s;plendor. For while they wi&s;ely and faithfully attend to that Con&s;ti|tution, which the united wi&s;dom and care of the whole People have formed and cho&s;en, and which is admira|bly adapted to the &s;ecurity and promotion of the gen|eral welfare, how can the People complain? How can they refu&s;e either approbation, or gratitude? They mu&s;t &s;ee, that &s;uch conduct &s;ecures their liberties and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and in many ways renders the enjoyment of them greatly enhanced. Laws made by &s;uch Rulers, mu&s;t be, not only con&s;titutional, but wi&s;e and whole|&s;ome. They mu&s;t be agreeable to all good citizens; and offen&s;ive only to "the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient," for whom they are e&s;pecially needful. Such rulers will &s;hine in their orbits with bright and cheering rays. They mu&s;t &s;ee, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, which people in the ma&s;s overlook, &s;uch mea&s;ures as will favour the gen|eral welfare. They mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to know the mo&s;t equitable and ea&s;y way of levying taxes, the mo&s;t wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary laws, the mo&s;t worthy and &s;uitable men for all civil offices, the mo&s;t eligible ways of promoting di&s;coveries and improvements in arts and &s;ciences, and in the comforts and conveniencies of life; the mo&s;t efficacious means of checking vice, and aiding virtue; and, in general, the be&s;t ways of promoting the public welfare. Such Rulers will be viewed by all the wi&s;e and good, as the Light and Happine&s;s of the People. And if one among them could be found alone to wi&s;h the light quenched, that the ble&s;&s;ings of anarchy might &s;ucceed, he alone would de&s;erve to have his choice, and to "be filled with his own ways."</P>
<P>If Rulers would &s;hine with a genial &s;plendor, and give &s;olid joy to the people, they mu&s;t attend with much care to the <HI>Laws</HI> which they make to govern
<PB N="10" REF="035317_0009_10022B89CD7B3F88">
them. The ba&s;is of the&s;e &s;hould ever be ju&s;tice and mercy. The&s;e virtues &s;hould always be encouraged, and the oppo&s;ite vices checked. Rulers in their de|&s;ign "are not a terror to good works, but to evil." And no good and quiet man &s;hould be &s;lavi&s;hly "afraid of the power;" but a&s;&s;ured, that, "doing well he &s;hould have prai&s;e of the &s;ame." Ju&s;tice is, perhaps, the brighte&s;t gem in the crown of a Ruler. He &s;hould ever be able to &s;ay, "I put on righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and it clothed me: and my judgment was a robe and a diadem." This &s;hould be the robe of every Magi&s;trate, in every department of government. For how can a People be happy when this is not the ca&s;e? If iniquity be framed by law, what will become of the peace and felicity of the People? And if the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice be &s;topped among a People by the corruption or intimidation of the judicial powers, "where can the righteous &s;eek redre&s;s?" And how can the guilty be made afraid? Ju&s;tice is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the welfare of communities!</P>
<P>It is in it&s;elf an exalted and divine virtue. In this we peculiarly re&s;emble the Deity. Almo&s;t all other virtues have a reference to our&s;elves. This is gener|ous and benevolent, extending to all mankind. GOD alone is ju&s;t to perfection, and able to di&s;tribute it en|tire and without defect. His omni&s;cience gives him the mo&s;t complete view of all moral beings; and his almighty arm enables him to render to all according to their deeds.</P>
<P>The nearer Civil Rulers (who are gods below) ap|proach to the Divine Model, the more truly are they the light of the People: And by a wi&s;e mixture of mercy and ju&s;tice, in their admini&s;trations, they re&s;em|ble the Deity in that ravi&s;hing glory which is &s;een "in the face of JESUS CHRIST." Let our laws partake of the&s;e heavenly ingredients; and let them be truly and faithfully executed. On the&s;e two pillars hang all the wealth and quietne&s;s of the People. At lea&s;t they are
<PB N="11" REF="035317_0010_10022B8F37A35110">
e&s;&s;ential to their virtue and happine&s;s, their ea&s;e and tranquillity.</P>
<P>Sumptuary and economical laws might aid the cau&s;e of virtue, and &s;o far as the powers of government reach that way, they will be well employed to check a rage for extravagant diver&s;ions and amu&s;ements of all kinds. The&s;e things are injurious to <HI>young</HI> Republics, and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Republics. I am aware the &s;ubject is delicate, and the &s;pirit of the times backward to re&s;traint; yet we venture to &s;ay, "A land of levity is a land of guilt." A People devoted to high-&s;ea&s;oned plea&s;ures, and &s;howy diver&s;ions, improved by the flowers of eloquence, are apt to form romantic ideas of happine&s;s, to lo&s;e a reli&s;h for the &s;olid duties and comforts of life, and to contract a growing di&s;ta&s;te to the better plea&s;ures of virtue, and the elevating hopes of religion. We are apt in this way to "&s;eek a Heaven below the &s;kies," and to neg|lect that which is above. The natural effect is, a carnal and worldly temper. To oppo&s;e the &s;teps which lead to this, and to remove the temptations to it, are labours worthy of all Mini&s;ters, civil or &s;acred. Encouraging frugality, indu&s;try and temperance in plea&s;ure, and op|po&s;ing the oppo&s;ite evils, Magi&s;trates do well. In thus regarding ju&s;tice and mercy, and &s;eeking al&s;o the pro|motion of beneficial and virtuous habits of living, they will &s;hine to approbation; and it will be the duty of the People to "lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty."</P>
<P>If Rulers would be the light of the People, they mu&s;t attend clo&s;ely to the <HI>characters</HI> of men whom they put into <HI>authority.</HI> Every man in office &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of probity and firmne&s;s, and a friend to mankind and to righteou&s;ne&s;s. The laws of a country may be wi&s;e and good; yet, when the actions of men are tried by them, they may be twi&s;ted and perverted, &s;o that the innocent &s;hall &s;uffer, and the guilty be acquitted. The laws &s;hall have "a meaning never meant," owing to &s;ome vague expre&s;&s;ions in the frame of them; or &s;ome
<PB N="12" REF="035317_0011_10022B93ECCA4B18">
other handle will be made u&s;e of to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Hence the importance of integrity in the judicial de|partments.</P>
<P>Men in office, de&s;igned to keep the peace of &s;oci|ety, and promote ju&s;tice and union among neighbours, may do eminent &s;ervice, acting well, and keeping the end of their appointment in view. By advi&s;ing par|ties to peace and friend&s;hip, and &s;ometimes relaxing their fees, they may prevent much mi&s;chief, and pro|mote much happine&s;s. All "our officers &s;hould be peace, and our exactors righteou&s;ne&s;s;" that "our peace may be as a river." "Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation." It tends to happine&s;s, and procures the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, "which maketh rich." "When he giveth quietne&s;s who then can make trouble? And when he hideth his face who then can behold him? Whether it be done again&s;t a nation, or again&s;t a man only." Righteous men in of|fice &s;hine and allure to right conduct by their example. Under them government is beloved and honoured. Be&s;ide, when it is well known that government is ju&s;t, and that unworthy men are excluded from po&s;ts of honour and profit, this very thing will be an incentive to a fair and good character. And men ever known to have been &s;elfi&s;h, and never to have &s;erved the in|tere&s;ts of &s;ociety, will be afraid to be candidates for im|portant offices. The idea of di&s;appointment will check them; and they will dread to have their characters held up to public view, le&s;t they &s;hould become doubly &s;candalous to them. This care to fill offices with wor|thy men, will then turn out greatly advantageous to the public: For good men al&s;o would as readily come forward, in this ca&s;e, as the ba&s;e would hide them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In order to prove that the Deity is on the &s;ide of vir|tue, and that it will finally prevail, an eminent author has <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> a nation to be wholly righteous. The fame, the nature and the government of this nation, are <HI>imagined</HI> to make it the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t hap|py nation on earth. One &s;tep, and an important one
<PB N="13" REF="035317_0012_10022B9C50CF11F0">
towards this &s;ingular felicity of a people, would be an exclu&s;ive introduction of worthy men into places of authority.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of this, even the unenlightened PHARAOH was wholly influenced by it in the choice of a very im|portant officer. He &s;aid to his &s;ervants, "Can we find &s;uch a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of GOD is?" on which ROLLIN makes this good reflec|tion: "In talking thus he entirely reformed a fal&s;e policy, which con&s;iders virtue and religion as un&s;er|viceable in the government of a State, and finds an exact probity too great a check upon its views and projects. This &s;tupid impiety is expo&s;ed to eternal &s;hame by an infidel King. He is convinced that the more of the Spirit of GOD a Mini&s;ter has, the more capable he is of governing a kingdom. And the lea&s;t attention &s;uffices to di&s;cover, that the oppo&s;ite principle flows from the utter want of human under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>When therefore, in any government, the vile&s;t men may ri&s;e, either by &s;ervility or &s;econdary influence, we may &s;ay, there is a radical defect in admini&s;tration. So far &s;uch a government is reduced to infamy and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>And as, in our happy country, the People po&s;&s;e&s;s the privilege of choo&s;ing their Rulers, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance it is of mighty importance that they &s;hould have that knowledge and that virtue which will enable them to make a ju&s;t and wi&s;e u&s;e of it. To this end the in|crea&s;e of virtue and general knowledge, is greatly to be de&s;ired and promoted. For what is a Free Repub|lic, and what is it &s;oon like to be, without its e&s;&s;ential pillars? Even &s;ince the days of our independence, al|though a People never had greater privileges, or made more rapid &s;trides in pro&s;perity, it has co&s;t the nation large &s;ums to quell in&s;urrections and rebellions. But, could the&s;e have ri&s;en, had the nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a due &s;hare of knowledge and virtue? Let us all then exert
<PB N="14" REF="035317_0013_10022BA1414E07B8">
our&s;elves to promote the&s;e; and let no man ri&s;e to po&s;ts of honour without them. For,
<Q><L>When impious men bear &s;way,</L>
<L>The po&s;t of honour is the private &s;tation.</L></Q></P>
<P>But this will not be the only misfortune of &s;uch men bearing &s;way. The body will receive detriment, and in more ways than one. The national intere&s;ts will be neglected; merit will be di&s;couraged, and vile men will rejoice, and do mi&s;chief without fear.</P>
<P>As the light and &s;upport of the People, Rulers mu&s;t defend them in their enjoyments, by keeping <HI>peace</HI> at home and abroad, as far as may be.</P>
<P>In this weighty bu&s;ine&s;s, I confe&s;s, more wi&s;dom is required, than I have any claim to; but that internal and external peace is a ble&s;&s;ing of the fir&s;t magnitude, and accordingly to be &s;ought, no one will deny.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure it at <HI>home,</HI> and to promote all the ble&s;&s;|ings to which it is favourable, is the duty of Rulers; and if the&s;e ends can be obtained by the wi&s;e and pru|dent conduct of government, it will be happy. And, in general, we may hope for this. But if unrea&s;onable men will, notwith&s;tanding, ri&s;e up again&s;t the govern|ment, and di&s;turb the public peace, <HI>force</HI> is then ju&s;tly re&s;orted to.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure us from <HI>foreign wars,</HI> it is plainly the duty of Rulers to be ju&s;t in their conduct towards the other nations with whom they have connexions. And if mi&s;under&s;tanding take place between us and any &s;uch nation, it &s;eems truly ju&s;t and wi&s;e, and a part of commendable policy, to try the event of upright and honorable negociation. And the importance of pre|venting an open rupture with &s;uch a nation may be &s;o great as to ju&s;tify all the &s;teps of an amicable and <HI>per|&s;evering</HI> negociation. Such &s;teps will vindicate our na|tional character in the eyes of all nations; bring down the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD upon us; fill the people with love to government, and animate them firmly to defend

<P>We rejoice and ble&s;s GOD, that the conduct of our Rulers, to keep peace at home and abroad, is the exact re&s;emblance of all that we have &s;aid.</P>
<P>As the calamities of war are devoutly to be depre|cated; &s;o we pray GOD, that the mea&s;ures taken for our ju&s;t defence may turn out, under a benign Provi|dence, the prevention of them. And as this is the aim and good de&s;ign of our Rulers; &s;o, I doubt not, they cordially approve of the &s;pirit of that prayer which was offered by a great prince and warrior after a deci&s;ive battle:
<Q><L>Make wars, O LORD, by wars to cea&s;e;</L>
<L>And let this conque&s;t lead to peace.</L></Q>
But &s;hould we, after all, be called to put the harne&s;s on, the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of our cau&s;e would lead us to hope in that GOD who has ever been "the hope of our I&s;rael and the Saviour of it in times of trouble."</P>
<P>I only add, rulers will be eminently the light of the people by aiding the cau&s;e and promotion of <HI>learning, virtue</HI> and <HI>religion.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the real and la&s;ting welfare of the body, and have been &s;o truly the glory of our country, that our civil heads cannot promote or e&s;teem them to exce&s;s. To encourage, and &s;till maintain, &s;chools for youth, is, doubtle&s;s, one good means of an&s;wering the&s;e great purpo&s;es. And here we may al&s;o reckon the encouragement of u&s;eful <HI>di&s;coveries</HI> and <HI>inventions.</HI> And if they can do any thing by au|thority or example, to bring into a more ju&s;t e&s;teem, a learned and pious <HI>Chri&s;tian Mini&s;try,</HI> the times too lou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dly call for it.

one hand, and of di&s;order in churches, and angry &s;ep|arations and delu&s;ions, on the other, calls aloud to our Zion. With me, the&s;e are the mo&s;t portentous appear|ances of the day. If any men, or order of men, can be the happy in&s;truments of promoting more light and love among Chri&s;tians, they will be eminently honoured of GOD, and equally dear to the friends of CHRIST's peaceful kingdom.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Univer&s;ity,</HI> which has given &s;o many ornaments and ble&s;&s;ings both to Church and State, will receive the fo&s;tering care of our Civil Fathers.</P>
<P>And as they profe&s;s the religion of CHRIST, we hope with the greater confidence, that they will e&s;teem its heavenly doctrines, and ob&s;erve its pure precepts, and be lovely examples of &s;o divine a religion, in all their private deportment.</P>
<P>As <HI>Rulers,</HI> they will act for CHRIST, who has rai&s;ed them to &s;eats of dignity; and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es "all pow|er in heaven and earth." As they can &s;erve the com|munity <HI>&s;o well</HI> in no other way, in honouring relig|ion, this duty will be obvious to them. And as the works of <HI>Providence,</HI> in all ages, are de&s;igned to promote the Redeemer's kingdom and the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, we all, and Rulers eminently, &s;hould concur in that be&s;t de&s;ign.</P>
<P>And, as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> they may, perhaps, advance re|ligion as much by their <HI>private life and example,</HI> as by bending all the power of their governmental &s;tations that way. By firmly believing the in&s;piration of the &s;acred books, and defending it by its own &s;tanding and convincing evidence; by honouring and comforting the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, many of whom want com|fort; by attending public wor&s;hip, and revering our holy Sabbaths; by manife&s;ting the pure and the be|nevolent temper of the Go&s;pel in their daily life; by promoting the peace, union and edification of the re|&s;pective Churches to which they belong; and by di&s;|countenancing all loo&s;e principles and practices, and
<PB N="17" REF="035317_0016_10022BAE1ADC82B8">
encouraging things oppo&s;ite, they may do much to aid the be&s;t cau&s;e in the world, and "to &s;trengthen the things of religion which remain, and are ready to die." Behaving thus gloriou&s;ly, they will be the light of our I&s;rael, and remind us with joy of that better day of Zion, in which "Kings will be its nur&s;ing fathers, and Queens its nur&s;ing mothers," directing all their powers that way.</P>
<P>From this view of the duties of Rulers, however cur&s;ory and imperfect, we yet infer tho&s;e of the People.</P>
<P>If our Rulers govern us in love and wi&s;dom, by good laws, truly executed, and attend to our peace, and guard again&s;t the calamities of war; if they light the lamps of &s;cience, virtue and religion, and keep them burning, we &s;hould rejoice in their light, and &s;ay, "Ble&s;&s;ed be you, and ble&s;&s;ed be your fidelity, and ble&s;&s;ed be GOD." Such a government is an eminent in&s;trument to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es of bad men, and to defend the good. If in|&s;tances had never been given, who could form an <HI>idea</HI> of tho&s;e crying enormities and tran&s;cendent cruelties, into which men would run, unre&s;trained by an efficient and ju&s;t government? But were men, for any length of time, to "do what is right in their own eyes," we could &s;urely <HI>expect</HI> "no peace to him that goeth out, or to him that cometh in." To re&s;train lawle&s;s men, and prevent the eruption of conceived mi&s;chief, is one grand de&s;ign and happy effect of government. Ac|cording to &s;ome men, and good judges too, this is a <HI>principal</HI> end of all civil authority. This is an engine in the hands of GOD, by which he prevents &s;uch a del|uge of inhuman and ungodly deeds, as would other|wi&s;e make the world a more complete bedlam, than ever yet it has been. Now the righteous have <HI>&s;ome</HI> tranquillity; otherwi&s;e "their &s;ouls would be vexed from day to day by the conver&s;ation and deeds of the wicked:" And they would, probably, be &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as to "rejoice exceedingly, and be glad to find the grave."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="035317_0017_10022BB2CCBBE728">
How <HI>thankful</HI> then &s;hould we be for an efficient and ju&s;t government! And how much &s;hould we prize and honour the Light of our I&s;rael, and pay <HI>tribute</HI> to gov|ernment gladly! For is not <HI>that</HI> the &s;ecurity, not only of our farms and merchandize, but of our liberty and lives? And we &s;hould <HI>obey</HI> them from the united prin|ciples of intere&s;t and religion. The voice of in&s;pira|tion to the People, even under infidel Rulers, is, "Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the LORD's &s;ake: for &s;o is the will of GOD, that with well-doing ye may put to &s;ilence the ignorance of fooli&s;h men." With what irre&s;i&s;tible motives is this obedience pre&s;&s;ed on us, who&s;e Rulers are Chri&s;tians, and who&s;e "Nobles are of our&s;elves; and who&s;e Governor pro|ceeds from the mid&s;t of us;" and by our own glad choice too! I am not &s;urely pleading for "pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience and non-re&s;i&s;tance;" but for a rational and ea&s;y obedience to a government of our own, and Rulers of our own.</P>
<P>"But if our Rulers will not plea&s;e us, and guide the political &s;hip according to our <HI>better</HI> judgment, mu&s;t we pre&s;s our lips clo&s;e, nor dare condemn a mal-admini&s;|tration?"

And let us not be "un&s;table as water," car|ried about by every wind of "&s;editious doctrine." Let us be candid and quiet till there is a cau&s;e of com|plaint. For, under government, have we not the mo&s;t forcible call to this, and the be&s;t <HI>means</HI> of "leading quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty?" SOL|OMON's

advice was once good: "My &s;on, fear the LORD and the King, and meddle not with tho&s;e that are given to change."</P>
<P>It is &s;urely our reproach, if we are ever ready to complain of government, and to fret under <HI>every</HI> duty, as if a &s;trange and oppre&s;&s;ive thing had happened to us. We have pro&s;pered, above other People, un|der a mild and equitable government; and &s;hall we be peevi&s;h and ever unea&s;y with it? This is beneath the wi&s;dom and magnanimity of free men. It is too much like fretful children, who cannot be plea&s;ed by all the tenderne&s;s of their too indulgent parents. At this time it peculiarly becomes us to be the friends of government, and the &s;upport of our Rulers. Let us not make their cares heavier, when the defence and happine&s;s of our common country call for all their at|tention, and the mo&s;t &s;teady exertions. And, in the room of complaints and murmurs, let us ble&s;s GOD for good governments; and that we may well <HI>hope</HI> we &s;hall yet be continued free from oppre&s;&s;ion and de&s;pot|i&s;m on the one hand; and on the other, from the ter|rible effects of anarchy and unbounded licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed, we can hardly &s;et bounds to our national <HI>hopes,</HI> if we will but hone&s;tly and generally &s;eek the public weal, acting well in our &s;everal &s;tations. No doubt there are real difficulties and ob&s;tructions in the way. But what nation was ever free from them?</P>
<P>Let us mention &s;ome of the principal ones, and then &s;ee if we cannot rai&s;e an hopeful pro&s;pect of national happine&s;s, notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons are very jealous, that our Rulers will become <HI>de&s;potic;</HI> and that they are actually taking the previous &s;teps. But will not the&s;e pains be removed as &s;oon as they realize the checks and balances of our governments; the circum&s;tances of our Rulers as be|ing the &s;ame with their own; and the change and fre|quency of their elections?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="035317_0019_10022BBC48E15C78">
A &s;pirit of <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>anarchy,</HI> &s;o much &s;pread among us, is another enemy to public happine&s;s. But was not this to be expected, for a time, in &s;uch a na|tion as this, and in our circum&s;tances? Having dearly bought our liberty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the precious boon, it was natural to expect, that many would run wild with the idea, and not &s;uddenly di&s;tingui&s;h between govern|mental liberty, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. But are we not coming to our &s;en&s;es, and regarding this di&s;tinction more and more? And as we grow cool, and increa&s;e in knowledge, and experience the ble&s;&s;ings of good government, &s;hall we not &s;oon, and generally, drop this abu&s;e of liberty, and be willing to be happy? Let all good patriots and intelligent men teach their connexions this wi&s;dom, and join in advancing political information and &s;olid virtue. Thus, we may hope, the People will &s;ee their real intere&s;ts, and avoid a re&s;tle&s;s and &s;editious &s;pirit, which is its own tormentor.</P>
<P>The <HI>abu&s;e of religious liberty,</HI> it is granted, is another ob&s;truction of public pro&s;perity. This liberty is a pre|cious part of our &s;ingular privileges. It &s;hould be em|ployed to promote love and good works: The&s;e are its &s;weet effects, when guided by wi&s;dom and piety. But when it is made "an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h," an in&s;trument of mi&s;chief, it becomes an engine fatal to the be&s;t plea&s;ures and ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. Has it not thus opened a door to infidelity, and the corruption of Chri&s;tian doctrines, wor&s;hip and manners? It is be|lieved to have led the way to injurious divi&s;ions and angry &s;eparations among Chri&s;tians, and much enthu|&s;ia&s;m. By the&s;e means the peace and edification of Churches have been greatly injured; and many places have probably been thus retarded in their de&s;ires and pur&s;uits of &s;tated and faithful pa&s;tors.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire not that men &s;hould be deprived of the right of private judgment in religion. I would not wound the feelings of pious per&s;ons, however weak and mi&s;|led; but it is grievous to wi&s;e Chri&s;tians, to &s;ee &s;ouls

turned from the truth to fables; from the &s;implicity that is in CHRIST, to human fancies; from pure in|&s;piration, to its fatal counterfeit.</P>
<P>But has not this evil always taken place in times of civil commotions and revolutions? And, may we not hope, that time and con&s;ideration will remove it? We have the happie&s;t means of knowing true religion from all its counterfeits. We have colleges, academies and &s;chools, de&s;igned to promote general information and religious &s;cience. We have many excellent teachers in the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;try, workmen who need not to be a&s;hamed. Under &s;uch eminent means of in&s;truc|tion, let us cheerfully hope the time will &s;oon come when &s;educers and novices in divinity &s;hall be ea&s;ily di&s;covered and di&s;carded; when the peace of the Churches &s;hall be prized and maintained; and the &s;olid virtue and piety of <HI>Holy Writ</HI> be preferred to &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m. Let us all duly e&s;teem and improve a learned, faithful and pious Mini&s;try; and acquaint our&s;elves fully with the &s;criptural marks and arts of &s;educers, and avoid them. Let great care be taken in the introduction of men into the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; and let the peace and order of the Churches be &s;acredly regarded, and &s;uch as would break them be &s;hunned. And who can tell how &s;oon the abu&s;e of religious liberty, with all its ruinous effects, &s;hall give way to the increa&s;e of love and peace, regularity and holine&s;s?</P>
<P>We have al&s;o too much rea&s;on to believe, <HI>foreign intrigue</HI> has done much to divide us as a nation, and ob&s;truct the public weal.

An excellent and patriotic writer of our own has made this matter plain; "The ble&s;&s;ings of good government," &s;ays he, "have been mo&s;t imminently and immediately en|dangered

by <HI>foreign intrigue.</HI> From this &s;ource have ari&s;en our greate&s;t perils. This bane of our independ|ence, peace and pro&s;perity, has been operating in vari|ous ways for more than twenty years pa&s;t, in in&s;idious efforts to dimini&s;h our national limits, importance and re&s;ources; in keeping alive national prejudices; in at|tempts to prevent our having an efficient government; in artful &s;tratagems to dimini&s;h and weaken the pow|ers ve&s;ted in the Executive; to de&s;troy the <HI>checks</HI> and <HI>balances,</HI> and to con&s;olidate the di&s;tinct and well-de|fined powers of the Three Branches e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Con&s;titution; in frequent interferences in the man|agement of our national concerns; in fomenting di|visions among us; and in patronizing and circulating publications, calculated to cheri&s;h and increa&s;e them; by calumniating our Rulers, mi&s;repre&s;enting their mea&s;ures, and exciting murmurs, prejudices, and open and direct oppo&s;ition again&s;t the laws. In the&s;e, and many other ways, too numerous to detail, has foreign intrigue di&s;covered it&s;elf among us, and attempted to check our national growth, and to deprive us of the ble&s;&s;ings of a free and independent government.</P>
<P>It was by intrigues and artifices, like tho&s;e we have mentioned, that all the Republics of <HI>Europe</HI> have been pro&s;trated at the feet of <HI>France.</HI> It was in the &s;ame way that the free States of <HI>Greece</HI> were ruined, and their liberty lo&s;t."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DOCTOR MO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">Y.</NOTE> Let us ble&s;s GOD for this di&s;cov|ery; and be thankful that all our oppo&s;ition to gov|ernment, and a fatal &s;pirit of di&s;organization, are not the &s;pontaneous growth of the <HI>American &s;oil.</HI> It was through art and deception, and not from native cor|ruption, that many, otherwi&s;e good, citizens among as have done wron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, and injured their country.

<P>We only add; <HI>a &s;pirit of infidelity, immorality and ungodline&s;s,</HI> &s;preading among us, is another ob&s;truction of the public welfare, and an enemy to it. But, for our comfort, we &s;ay, neither is this of our <HI>own &s;oil,</HI> but a foreign production. The laborious and critical author, before cited, hath &s;aid, "The Philo&s;ophi&s;ts and Revolutioni&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> appear to have acted up|on the maxim of THOMAS PAINE, 'that <HI>an army of principles</HI> will penetrate where an army of &s;oldiers can|not. It is neither the Rhine (he &s;ays) the Channel, nor the <HI>Ocean,</HI> that can arre&s;t its progre&s;s. It will march to the horizon of the world, and it will con|quer.' In conformity to this maxim, that infamous book, &s;tyled, <HI>The Age of Rea&s;on,</HI> was written in France (and, it is &s;aid, in the hou&s;e and under the patronage of Mr. MUNROE) printed there in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lan|guage, and a cargo of 15,000 copies, at one time, &s;ent into the&s;e <HI>United States,</HI> and di&s;po&s;ed of by &s;ale at a cheap rate, or given away. Be&s;ides the&s;e imported copies, numerous editions of the &s;ame work (&s;hame on our country!) have been printed here. The effects pro|duced by the exten&s;ive circulation of the&s;e books, and others of the &s;ame ca&s;t and tendency, in the evident &s;pread of infidel and athei&s;tical principles, and the con|&s;equent deterioration of morals, evince that the&s;e Apo&s;|tles of <HI>Illuminati&s;m</HI> have not been un&s;ucce&s;sful in their labours."</P>
<P>It thus appears, we mu&s;t allow, that <HI>we were too ready</HI> to receive the fatal plant, and to cheri&s;h it. But will a People, always u&s;ed to reverence the GOD of Heaven, and among whom many pious &s;ouls remain, long be guilty of this madne&s;s? Rather let us hope,

that, in an exchange of circum&s;tances, we &s;hall, through grace, come to our&s;elves; honour the GOD of our Fathers; and confe&s;s, with deep contrition, that we have erred, and played the fool exceedingly.</P>
<P>The&s;e are our di&s;ea&s;es. Let us hope, through GOD, they are curable; le&s;t we mourn, in accents of untried &s;orrow, "Is there no balm in <HI>Gilead?</HI> No Phy&s;ician there? Why then is not the health of the People re|covered?"</P>
<P>We will &s;pend a few moments, however, in viewing the brighter &s;ide of our pro&s;pects; that we may rai&s;e our hopes &s;till higher of the nation's pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Providences of GOD</HI> to our Fathers, and to us, have been favourable, next to a miracle. Within our remembrance, he hath done great things for us; for which we &s;hould be glad, and offer due prai&s;e. Our revolution turned up events &s;o truly gracious, that the blind &s;ee, and the incon&s;iderate adore the hand of <HI>Him</HI> "who works in all, yet who alone &s;eems not to work." And &s;ince that day his ble&s;&s;ings have de&s;cended in &s;howers. If I be not deceived, never was there before a People &s;o numerous and &s;o well-informed as this, who had entire lei&s;ure and full opportunity, and the mo&s;t happy means of forming Con&s;titutions of Govern|ment for them&s;elves, and then of receiving them, after the mo&s;t mature deliberation. And our happine&s;s, under their admini&s;tration, has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even our own &s;anguine expectations. And this has been the ca&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the many and peculiar embarra&s;&s;ments which have attended &s;aid admini&s;tration. Never, it &s;eems, was there before a young Republic &s;o exceed|ingly harra&s;&s;ed in the management of its affairs. Eter|nal honour to our firm and patriotic Rulers, who have borne the burden and heat of the day. Some, better informed than my&s;elf, think their vigorous and firm mea&s;ures have &s;aved the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> it&s;elf from &s;hipwreck! If &s;o, what thanks are due to them, and to GOD!

Let the&s;e, and the Mini&s;ters of Religion, act in &s;weet agreement; let them look on each other with a benevolent eye, not mixing their powers and their intere&s;ts with unju&s;t or oppre&s;&s;ive views; but im|bibing a &s;pirit of love and e&s;teem mutually; and aid|ing each other in the great and godlike de&s;ign of ma|king an happy nation. So will the LORD fulfil all our de&s;ires, leading his cho&s;en people by the hands of MOSES and AARON.</P>
<P>If any thing has been delivered, un&s;uitable to this important and joyful occa&s;ion, or injurious to the pub|lic weal, the candour of this intelligent audience will cover it. And may GOD ble&s;s a &s;incere endeavour to &s;erve my country, to fulfil my duty, and to aid the Redeemer's cau&s;e, &s;o generally and &s;o unhappily neg|lected.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will accept of our congratulations on the repeated &s;uffrages of your country, by which you are again the fir&s;t light of this part of our I&s;rael. To pay you, Sir, an unmeaning or painful compli|ment, I am not willing. But to rejoice in a man be|loved and approved in &s;o exalted a &s;tation, and whom an intelligent People have &s;o often called to the Chief Seat of Government, is both my plea&s;ant duty and gratified ambition.</P>
<P>It is our &s;weet hope, that you will &s;till attend faith|fully, with advice of <HI>Council,</HI> to the defence, and hap|pine&s;s of your country. <HI>Their</HI> wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s, we tru&s;t, will be a &s;ea&s;onable aid to your Excellency. Your own judgment will naturally be confirmed by their's, enabling you to act with fuller &s;atisfaction, and more animating hopes. That mode&s;ty which attends
<PB N="27" REF="035317_0026_10022A8DF0825D90">
merit will gladly receive concurring advice. And thus acting, you will do honour to your&s;elf, and verify the remark of SOLOMON: "The words of wi&s;e men are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools."</P>
<P>We pre&s;ume not to in&s;truct your Excellency; but it is agreeable to our &s;ubject to &s;ay, you will tenderly love the People; pay a &s;acred regard to the Con&s;titution in your conduct; &s;ee that governmental proceedings are guided by wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice; regard merit in pla|cing men in office; &s;eek the peace of the nation; and aid the progre&s;s of learning, virtue and religion. You will attend, Sir, to the removal of the cruel ob&s;truc|tions, which are thrown in the way of the public wel|fare; and as readily improve the &s;ea&s;ons and means of advancing the proper and direct happine&s;s of the body. Your urbanity and moral virtues will eminent|ly &s;erve the general cau&s;e; as the manners of the great de&s;cend to the lower grades of men, and are caught with avidity. And as "a Chri&s;tian is the highe&s;t &s;tyle of man," you, Sir, will &s;hine with redoubled lu&s;tre, hav|ing &s;incerely joined that to "His Excellency." With this mingled glory, Sir, we pray, that you may long be a light and a ble&s;&s;ing on earth; and finally &s;hine, as the &s;un in the firmament, and as a &s;tar for ever and ever.</P>
<P>The Two Branches of the General Court receive our re&s;pect, and our cordial wi&s;hes for them, as men, and as Rulers. That part of them, who have long &s;erved their country, and honoured their &s;tations, de&s;erve our thanks; as they receive the approbation of their con|&s;tituents in a light the mo&s;t unequivocal in their re|peated elections. May the elections of the day be at|tended to with that deliberation, wi&s;dom and regard to merit, which the importance of the matter demands. As affairs of great moment may come before you in the cour&s;e of the year, we pray GOD to give you that
<PB N="28" REF="035317_0027_10022A926FAB4EE0">
knowledge, integrity and firmne&s;s, which will render you equal to them. And as real worth is proved in arduous and trying &s;ervices, and &s;hines the more, we tru&s;t you will be prepared to manife&s;t that worth, &s;hould the trial come. The po&s;t of honour is often the po&s;t of danger. Let your genuine patrioti&s;m, and your re&s;olution in duty, make you equal to every trial.</P>
<P>Be united in your <HI>love</HI> of the country, that, with the more ea&s;e you may be united al&s;o in the <HI>means</HI> of its pre&s;ervation and happine&s;s. Put on candour and patience in your deliberations; and let no partial views bias your judgments, or corrupt your affections. And let me &s;ay, with the faire&s;t intention, and with all due re&s;pect, "Take heed, Honoured Fathers, that ye fall not out by the way." "A kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand." You will do all in your power to prevent &s;uch ruin.</P>
<P>The times are difficult. A good old Mini&s;ter of this country in &s;uch a day, made this caution the ground of a public di&s;cour&s;e: "When we do not know what to do, we &s;hould be careful not to do we know not what." Your knowledge and prudence, I hope, will &s;ave you always from &s;uch ra&s;hne&s;s. Many cau&s;es, and &s;ome of them forcible, have perplexed and divided the minds of good citizens in their ideas of government and politics. It will be your duty and honour to &s;ee through tho&s;e things which grieve and divide others; and by a conduct uniformly wi&s;e, con|&s;titutional and benevolent, to open their eyes; and thus to convince them al&s;o, that our government and admini&s;tration are, as they ought to be, eminently for the good of the People; and that there is a mighty difference between government, and no government; between a good one, and a corrupt one; and between their real friends, and in&s;idious foes. By &s;uch a con|duct may you greatly &s;erve the State.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="035317_0028_10022A96B7028CD0">
And may this government, and every State govern|ment &s;o concur with a wi&s;e, firm and righteous ad|mini&s;tration of the Federal Government, as that the Union &s;hall be &s;afely guided through its pre&s;ent &s;ea of perplexity and fear, to the haven of entire peace with it&s;elf. And may this internal peace be accompanied with peace abroad, and not di&s;turbed with foreign wars or foreign politics. And we al&s;o pray, that, on their own account, all the nations of <HI>Europe</HI> may be guided to an equitable and la&s;ting peace; in which the peace of Zion, and the welfare of mankind may al&s;o be great and la&s;ting. In all your efforts to &s;hine, and be u&s;eful in your high &s;tations, may GOD guide you by unerring wi&s;dom, and crown them with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. And all the people who are wi&s;e and good, will receive your &s;ervices with gratitude; and, for your &s;akes, as well as their own, they will pray, that the light of I&s;rael may not be quenched. May you all be faithful in a few things, and finally be made Ru|lers over many things, and be welcomed to your Great Ma&s;ter's joy.</P>
<P>A principle of piety is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the di&s;charge of all relative duties, as well as all others, that I &s;hall be ju&s;tified in clo&s;ing this di&s;cour&s;e by an inculcation of it.</P>
<P>Men and Brethren, whether Rulers or ruled, we have all a part to act in this &s;hort life, of importance, beyond all conception great. A future and an eter|nal &s;cene awaits us; full of joy and glory on the one hand, and of &s;hame and contempt on the other. We &s;hall e&s;cape the latter and obtain the former, if the grace which bringeth &s;alvation teach us to deny ungod|line&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the pre&s;ent world. Thus &s;erving GOD, and our generation by the will of GOD, we &s;hall re|ceive the end of our cour&s;e, the <HI>&s;alvation</HI> of our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The worth of <HI>this</HI> is learned by <HI>one</HI> con&s;ideration, taken by it&s;elf, without addition. The Mini&s;ters,
<PB N="30" REF="035317_0029_10022A9D8445D770">
whom GOD hath provided for human happine&s;s, and for <HI>this</HI> eminently, afford this in&s;truction. The great <HI>REDEEMER</HI> came into the world as our &s;ervant; "not to be mini&s;tered unto, but to mini&s;ter, and to give his life a ran&s;om for many." The <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven are &s;ent forth to "mini&s;ter to the heirs of &s;alvation." <HI>Chri&s;tian Rulers,</HI> are "mini&s;ters of GOD to us for good." The <HI>Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel</HI> are, in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, "our &s;ervants for JESUS' &s;ake." They are the gift of our a&s;cended Head, appointed and continued "for the perfecting of the &s;aints, for the work of the Mini&s;try, and the edifying of the body of CHRIST, till we come to the &s;tature of perfect men." To render this Mini&s;try thus glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful, the <HI>HOLY SPIRIT</HI> is al&s;o &s;ent into the world. In this view he is, in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, a Mini&s;ter of GOD for our good. And as all Heaven is for us, rejoicing at the repent|ance and &s;alvation of one &s;inner: So all Hell is again&s;t us, the prince of it, with his legions, walking about, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</P>
<P>If &s;uch be the combat, and &s;uch the combatants, what mu&s;t the <HI>prize</HI> of the warfare be! <HI>Is our &s;alvation of &s;uch amazing import?</HI> Then let us &s;o e&s;teem it! Let us adore the GOD who has made the wonderous pro|vi&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>What a creature is man, for whom the GOD of Heaven hath done &s;o much! I do not know that we can think too highly of our&s;elves, even in the depths of our humility, for our crimes.</P>
<LG>
<L>Of human <HI>nature</HI> ne'er too high</L>
<L>Are our ideas wrought;</L>
<L>Of human <HI>merit</HI> ne'er too low</L>
<L>Depre&s;s'd the daring thought."</L>
</LG>
<P>Can we act agreeably to the dignity of this nature, and our future pro&s;pects, unle&s;s we become the willing followers of CHRIST, the Light of our world, and the
<PB N="31" REF="035317_0030_10022AA15D4539A0">
Saviour of our &s;ouls? May his healing word dwell in us richly, and guide us in our duty to GOD, to &s;ociety, and to our&s;elves, and make us harmle&s;s and blame|le&s;s, the children of GOD, without rebuke, &s;hining as lights in the world. Then, with the a&s;&s;urance of hope, we may long for that day, in which the righteous &s;hall &s;hine as the &s;un, in the kingdom of their Father.</P>
<P>To that ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and glory may we all at la&s;t be brought, through JESUS CHRIST, our Divine Redeemer.</P>
