<P><HI>_I Have the favour of yours of</HI> 1<HI>&s;t December per the</HI> Bladen, <HI>with Copies of the Reports of the Board of Trade and Plantations, and of the Committee of Council for Plan|tation Affairs; concerning our Land-Bank &s;o called: I ob&s;erve that having examined into the Na|ture of the Scheme, and of the refu&s;al of the</HI> Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives <HI>to pay any Regard to the</HI> GOVERNOUR's <HI>Me&s;&s;age concerning
<PB N="4" REF="004738_0003_100DD11DC8406188">
the &s;ame; they approve of the Governour and Councils Pro|ceedings, and do declare that the &s;aid Scheme appears to them to be not only Illegal, but of dangerous Tendency; and mu&s;t create great Confu&s;ion, and Interruption in Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well to the Traders in New-England, as in Great Bri|tain; and in Order that the &s;aid Land-Bank may be as &s;peedi|ly and effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible, they are pur&s;uing Methods to put a Stop to the &s;ame, until &s;uch Time as the Legi&s;lature of Great Britain &s;hall take the State of the Paper Currencies of all the Plantations into Con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>You de&s;ire a particular Account of this <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> (as you call it) <HI>Combination,</HI> lately made, to evade Re&s;olves of Parliament, and King's In&s;tructions; and to a&s;&s;ume <HI>by Virtue of their Numbers, the e&s;tabli&s;hing of Currency,</HI> which is ab&s;olutely the Prerogative of the Crown; you engage me to keep &s;trictly to <HI>plain Facts,</HI> without Sugge&s;tions, and Surmi&s;es of my own, or of others: Therefore to avoid all Su&s;picion of Partiality, in&s;tead of a private Letter, I &s;end it you publi&s;hed in the Place where is the Scene of Action.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t premi&s;e <HI>a &s;hort Detail of our Plantations Paper-Effects.</HI> Upon &s;ome Exigencys, there not being Ca&s;h in the Trea&s;ury &s;ufficient, there was i&s;&s;ued <HI>Trea&s;ury Notes</HI> or Obligations, to be &s;atisfyed, or cancelled, in a &s;hort Time. The Goodne&s;s of the <HI>Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hants,</HI> to &s;trengthen the Hands of the Government, <HI>gave the&s;e Notes Credit as Ca&s;h.</HI> Some Admini&s;trations took Advantage of this Credit given to their Notes, and <HI>impo&s;ed upon the Merchant</HI> egregiou&s;ly:</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> By I&s;&s;uing out <HI>too large Quantities</HI> of the&s;e Notes with <HI>long Periods,</HI> their publick Bills of Credit &s;uffered a growing Di&s;count.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That this growing Di&s;count might not put a Stop to their Currency, tho&s;e dependent Colonies by By-Laws
<PB N="5" REF="004738_0004_100DD120A6796938">
of their own, a&s;&s;umed the KING's Prerogative in Currencies; and made their own Notes a common <HI>Ten|der in Law.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> By frequent po&s;tponing the Cancellings of tho&s;e Bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s they encouraged Po&s;tponing of private Debts, which has occa&s;ioned <HI>a general In&s;en&s;ibility of Di&s;credit</HI> in all Trade, and Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly, Shop-Notes</HI> were never u&s;ed in Payments, until publick Notes took Place, being their genuine Off|&s;pring; thus Trade&s;men, Artificers, and other poor La|bourers, are left to the Shop-keeper's Mercy, for their Pay in Goods, at any Rate.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> This gave the Hint to <HI>Combinations</HI> for emit|ting private Bills of Credit, which, if not &s;peedily and effectually qua&s;h'd, will inevitably produce <HI>Mutiny, Se|dition,</HI> and <HI>Riots.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> we have at pre&s;ent an unac|countable Confu&s;ion of Paper Currency: <HI>Publick Bills of Credit,</HI> viz. The old Bills of the four Provinces of <HI>New-England,</HI> at <HI>Twenty nine Shillings</HI> per Ounce, Silver: <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> new Tenor, at <HI>Six Shillings and Eight Pence,</HI> but current at <HI>Nine Shillings and Eight Pence. Connecti|cut</HI> new Tenor, at <HI>Eight Shillings. Rhode-I&s;land</HI> new Tenor, at <HI>Six Shillings and nine Pence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Private Bills of Credit.</HI> 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Silver Money Scheme or <HI>Merchants Notes,</HI> whereof <HI>One hundred &amp; ten thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Value was emitted, <HI>Anno</HI> 1733, to prevent an enor|mous <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> publick Emi&s;&s;ion, from depreciating our Currency: The&s;e Bills continue to be <HI>punctually paid in Gold and Silver</HI> as they become due, and are at pre&s;ent 33 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than Province Bills.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Another Sum of <HI>Merchants Notes,</HI> value <HI>One hundred and twenty thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> emitted, <HI>Anno</HI> 1740,
<PB N="6" REF="004738_0005_100DD12343CEC310">
on a Silver Bottom, projected to &s;tifle that pernicious <HI>grand Bubble</HI> called <HI>The Land Bank.</HI> Tho&s;e Bills, con&s;ider'd ab|&s;tractedly, are advantageous to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; being pay|able upon Demand in a legal Currency, they are equivalent to Ca&s;h; and carrying a growing Profit of 3 <HI>per Cent. per Annum,</HI> they are better than Province Bills, and (if other ways regular) as good as the Stocks and Com|panies Bonds in <HI>London</HI>: The Signers without further Recour&s;e upon the Partner&s;hip, being our mo&s;t emi|nent and wealthy Traders, are capable, when required, to call in, and pay off, all their Bills upon a &s;hort Sight.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, it was always my Opinion, That all <HI>private Emi&s;&s;ions, de&s;igned as a common Currency, with|out a Patent from the Prerogative, are irregular and il|legal</HI>: A private Per&s;on who &s;trikes a <HI>Crown</HI> Piece, tho' equal, or better, in Weight and Finene&s;s, than a <HI>royal Crown Piece</HI>; is equally, in the Eye of our Laws, tho' not in it&s;elf, culpable, as a Per&s;on who &s;trikes a bra&s;s Crown &s;ilvered.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>Land-Bank,</HI> or Manufactory Scheme, (the de&s;igned Subject of this Letter) being a late Com|bination of a va&s;t Multitude of nece&s;&s;itous, idle, and ex|travagant Per&s;ons; with all the Signs of a genuine Bubble; contriv'd to have what they call Money, at an ea&s;y Rate; and to pay their Debts in a precarious falla|cious Kind of Bills, very ill, or not at all, &s;ecured; of no determined Value; bearing no Intere&s;t; not payable (the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or cannot oblige to an Acceptance) until after twenty Years, and being a very large Sum (equal to all the then provincial Bills of <HI>New-England</HI>) of <HI>Six hundred thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> will, if not remedied, depreci|ate all Paper Currencies, that are not determined by a Silver Value, con&s;equently prove a great Prejudice to private Property in the Province, and great Lo&s;s and Damage to the Merchants of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> trading to <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004738_0006_100D87DC11213930">Your Surmi&s;e is groundle&s;s, That perhaps &s;ome of our Merchants, who have &s;uffered much by deprecia|ting publick Bills, have, <HI>je&s;uitically,</HI> and as it were be|hind the Curtain, <HI>prompted</HI> the unthinking Multitude, to a <HI>Scheme,</HI> running into unheard of Extremities of Sum, and Period; and at this critical Time, when all Paper Money is under the <HI>Cen&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>Boards</HI> and <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> on purpo&s;e to bring the <HI>Parliament</HI> under the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peedily and effectu|ally &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Paper Money of all Kinds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> of this <HI>Scheme,</HI> was from a few evil-mind|ed Men, contrived only for their own Benefit, and have admitted a great Multitude of Sub&s;cribers, by their Numbers to give it a Circulation, and to contri|bute towards indemnifying them again&s;t all Acts of Government. Its being <HI>contrived only for the Benefit of the Directors,</HI> appears by their Con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> They are to be <HI>Directors in Perpetuity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> They are to have a <HI>Negative</HI> in all Re&s;olves of general Meetings.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Their <HI>Sallaries,</HI> other Charges of Manage|ment, and their living &s;umptou&s;ly, at Free-Co&s;t, will amount to <HI>Two per Cent. per Annum,</HI> of the original Stock; (the original <HI>South Sea Stock</HI> of <HI>Ten Millions</HI> was allowed only <HI>Eight thou&s;and Pounds</HI> for Manage|ment, which is &s;carce <HI>One</HI> 12<HI>th per Cent. per Annum</HI>) They de&s;ign to convert <HI>Sixty thou&s;and Pounds</HI> of the <HI>principal Stock</HI> into <HI>Trade,</HI> that they may have a greater <HI>Latitude of impo&s;ing</HI> upon the Partner&s;hip. The <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and all other well con&s;tituted Banks, are re&s;tricted from trading, that their Stock may remain good at home, ready to an&s;wer all Demands. Their ludicrous Pretence is, That &s;ince the Merchants will not &s;ell them Goods for this worthle&s;s Money, they will import all &s;orts of Merchandi&s;e, for the Benefit of the
<PB N="8" REF="004738_0007_100DD1289420F828">
Partner&s;hip: Their Directors cannot &s;eriou&s;ly pretend to under&s;tand Trade, only one of their Number is called Merchant, or rather a Factor for &s;ome <HI>Marooners</HI> or Logwood-Cutters, in the Bay of <HI>Honduras.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> They <HI>alter</HI> the <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Partner&s;hip</HI> at Plea&s;ure, without Con&s;ent of a general Meeting, pre|tending (contrary to all good Regulation) that private Con&s;ent of the Members, without Deliberation or De|bate, is &s;ufficient; this is the Rea&s;on of their Scheme being &s;o often <HI>botched</HI>: Their Scheme now &s;ent to you, is their la&s;t, as it &s;tands in the County Regi&s;ter; it was refu&s;ed a Record in the Secretary's Office: How &s;oon it may be alter'd, we know not.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> The <HI>County Regi&s;ters</HI> being lately &s;earch'd by Order of the Governour and Council, to find out the civil and military Officers, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ty in this Combination; It was di&s;covered, That the principal Projectors, or Bubblers, the <HI>Directors,</HI> &amp;c. had given <HI>no Security</HI> to the Partner&s;hip for their good Management, and for their Quota of this Money, taken up &s;ome Months &s;ince: The &s;ham Rea&s;on they give, of being very bu&s;y; is not only weak, but fully di&s;covers the Cheat and Impo&s;ition; becau&s;e in all well order'd hone&s;t Schemes, the Direc|tors, or Managers, are the fir&s;t who give Security.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire to know the Nature of our landed Inte|re&s;t, which by the&s;e evil-de&s;igning Men, is &s;et up in competition with the trading Intere&s;t. In <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the Landed-Intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ts generally of Gentlemen very Rich, with valuable Rent-Rolls; Our <HI>Freeholders</HI> generally are labouring Men, who earn le&s;s, and fare wor&s;e, than many in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and without any Rent-Rolls. Indulge me here, to ca&s;t a Vail over the Nakedne&s;s of our Country: This Country &s;eems de&s;igned by Nature for Trade, not for Produce: We Import Provi&s;ions at much ea&s;ier Rates from the Southern Provinces, than we can afford to rai&s;e them here. I am concerned in
<PB N="9" REF="004738_0008_100DD12B66F93410">
Lands, and therefore can have no &s;ini&s;ter End in di&s;|paraging of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; On the other &s;ide, <HI>Our Trade</HI> is not Inferiour to that of any of his Maje&s;ty's Plantations; and <HI>Our Navigation</HI> much exceeds any of them. The Truth is &s;hortly this; The Debtor part of the Country (which is va&s;tly the mo&s;t numerous) are contriving to baulk their Creditors by reducing the Denominations of Money (by their huge and ill-&s;ecured Emi&s;&s;ions) to a &s;mall or no Value; that they who have laudably acquired Fortunes by Indu&s;try and Frugality, may reap no Benefit thereof, but be upon a level with the Idle and Extravagant: We all have learnt by Experience that large Emi&s;&s;ions with di&s;tant Periods, have &s;unk a great Part of Debts, without any Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The Projectors gave to this <HI>Bubble</HI> the &s;pecious Name of, <HI>A Bank</HI>:&mdash; It has not the lea&s;t Affinity to Banking. <HI>Banking</HI> is i&s;&s;uing of Ca&s;h-Notes, payable upon Demand: or Merchants having lodged their Ca&s;h, the <HI>Bank tran&s;|fers</HI> Ca&s;h from one Merchant's Folio, to that of another, when required.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t This Sham-Bank has <HI>no Stock</HI> in their Trea&s;ury; and the Face of their Bills promi&s;ing to accept them for Stock in the Trea&s;ury is an <HI>arrant Bubble</HI>: It is true, that for &s;ome &s;hort Time the Directors decoyed &s;ome <HI>Graziers and Hog-Drivers,</HI> to part with their Pro|vi&s;ions for this their Land-Bank Money, but have &s;hip'd it off in Trade for the Profit of the <HI>D</HI>&mdash;, and perhaps to help to indemnify them&s;elves when obliged to make good the Bills by them &s;igned.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The&s;e Bills, tho' carrying no Intere&s;t, cannot make an effectual Demand of <HI>Acceptance till after Twenty Years,</HI> and then not payable in current Ca&s;h, but in Goods of an <HI>Arbitrary</HI> A&s;&s;ortment and Value.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="004738_0009_100DD12E0DBCEFF0">3dly, As Produce and Manufacture are more valuable than depretiating Bills; all Payments of the Partner&s;hip of Intere&s;t, and Parts of Principal, will be in the&s;e Bills; and con&s;equently no Produce, or Manufacture, will be found in their Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Being no Body-Corporate, they are under no Limitation: The Directors, who are for this very Pur|po&s;e the Signers, may and will emit Bills in <HI>indefinitum,</HI> or until at length their Value become near equal to the Charge of manufacturing them.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, If we can &s;uppo&s;e their <HI>Board of Bill-Makers</HI> to be hone&s;t-Men, and that in Con&s;cience (they having no other Check but Con&s;cience) they emit no more than according to their fir&s;t Articles, as they have no <HI>exclu&s;ive Patent,</HI> any other Number of de&s;perate Men may fol|low the &s;ame Money-making Trade, and Bills may multiply as in the former Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, In other Countries, the Opulent, the Hone&s;t, the Men of Credit, become Bankers; here the <HI>Indigent,</HI> the <HI>Debtors,</HI> the <HI>Frauduleut,</HI> &s;et up for <HI>Bankers</HI>: A Bank of a Numerous, but <HI>poor</HI> People, who pretend to cir|culate <HI>l.</HI> 600,000 without any Stock.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, To compleat the Farce, the <HI>Securities</HI> for cir|culating and paying off the&s;e Bills, are within them|&s;elves, and may be <HI>&s;tifled at Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Scheme</HI> is founded upon a Projection, di&s;approved of by the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> A. D. 1714; but is <HI>more Ini|quitous</HI>; That of A. D. 1714, required the Per&s;ons in Tru&s;t, particularly the Trea&s;urer to be of good Intere&s;t, known Integrity, and Reputation; and the Trea&s;urer to give <HI>l.</HI> 10,000 Security; The Directors to be di&s;tinct from the Tru&s;tees, and to be cho&s;en Annually at a Ge|neral Meeting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Committee di&s;tinct from the Directors to perfect and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bills.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004738_0010_100DD13085FDDFE0">The Projectors and Managers of this Scheme have <HI>Debauched</HI> the Minds of the People, by In&s;tilling unto them &s;ome pernicious Principles, de&s;tructive of all So|ciety, and good Government;</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That <HI>common Con&s;ent,</HI> or the Humour of the Multitude, ought to be the <HI>Ratio Ultima</HI> in every Thing and particularly in <HI>Currencies</HI>; whereas not only accor|ding to the Con&s;titution of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but of all po|lite Governments, Money or Currencies are the <HI>Pre|rogative</HI> of the the SOVEREIGNS, and have followed the univer&s;al Cu&s;tom of Merchants, whereby <HI>Silver</HI> from its own natural Qualifications, could not avoid becoming the <HI>univer&s;al Medium of Trade.</HI> If we may &s;uppo&s;e a Country entirely &s;eparated from the trading Part of the World, common Con&s;ent may admit of any Thing for a Currency, according to the Humour, or Profit of the Projectors; but this will fluctuate from one thing to another, until at length the mo&s;t proper Material obtain a permanent Con&s;ent: It is doubtle&s;s a <HI>high Mi&s;demea|nour</HI> to a&s;&s;ert &s;trenou&s;ly, the Priviledge of the People, to emit and pa&s;s any Thing as a Currency, in defiance, of the KING's <HI>Prerogative</HI> of <HI>Currencys.&mdash; Middleton,</HI> a neighbouring Town, has lately unanimou&s;ly voted, that <HI>This Bank-Money</HI> &s;hall be received as Ca&s;h for Town-Rates.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That every <HI>Landed Man,</HI> even to the mortgaging of his la&s;t Acre, has a <HI>Right</HI> to make <HI>Money</HI>: This is a mo&s;t de&s;tructive and wicked Principle, the Se|curity and Bulwark of a Country, are the&s;e People who have valuable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Effects to loo&s;e; whereas they who are much in Debt, become de&s;perate, and bad Subjects, and have nothing to hinder them from relin|qui&s;hing their Country to the fir&s;t Invader.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the <HI>indu&s;trious Merchants,</HI> and frugal monied Men, are the Bane of a Country; becau&s;e they expect their Debts and Dues to be hone&s;tly paid: Whereas a Country without Trade is of little Value,

<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> To <HI>value them&s;elves as being formidable</HI> by their Numbers, Two Thou&s;and Principals, as they pub|li&s;h, and many Thou&s;and Abettors: This is <HI>Ruffian</HI> like, by Superiority of Numbers, to endeavour to make ho|ne&s;t People <HI>buy the Rabbit.</HI> Such dangerous bare-fac'd Combinations, are not to be conniv'd at in Government; they openly threaten, that in the next A&s;&s;embly, no Body &s;hall be a <HI>Repre&s;entative,</HI> or of the <HI>Council,</HI> but tho&s;e who are Principals or Abettors in this Scheme; and thus have formed an <HI>Imperium in imperio.</HI> If this Wickedne&s;s of Combinations, under the Name of Banking, &s;hould &s;pread into our neighbouring <HI>Charter Governments</HI> (in <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> they have gone &s;ome Lengths in it) where all the Negatives, or Branches of the Legi&s;lature are elective by the People; they would become Ma&s;ters in all Affairs of Legi&s;lature and Government; their Dependance upon and Subjec|tion to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> would &s;oon vani&s;h. At this Time, in Neglect or Contempt of the Re&s;olves of <HI>Par|liament,</HI> and &s;ub&s;equent <HI>King's</HI> In&s;tructions, <HI>Connecticut</HI> have emitted <HI>One hundred and eight thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> and <HI>Rhode I&s;land, Eighty thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> Province Bills.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> By the inclo&s;ed News-Papers, printed in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> you may &s;ee, and we here upon the Spott do daily hear, how the <HI>Managers</HI> &s;pirit the People to <HI>Mu|tiny, Sedition,</HI> and <HI>Riots</HI>: One gives it for Law, That no <HI>Orders</HI> from the Boards at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> nor Acts of <HI>Parliament,</HI> can put a Stop to their Proceedings; Others &s;ay, We &s;hall <HI>humble</HI> the proud Merchants; That if the Merchants will not receive the&s;e Bills in Pay, they mu&s;t blame them&s;elves for any <HI>Outrages</HI> that may hap|pen;

<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That for the pre&s;ent, the mo&s;t &s;ummary Way of proceeding again&s;t this Combination, would be, To &s;end for the <HI>Trea&s;urer, Directors,</HI> and <HI>Indor&s;er,</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> by a <HI>Me&s;&s;enger,</HI> with a Secretary of State's War|rant, to bring them upon Examination, concerning this high Crime and Mi&s;demeanour: But this would ruin them in their &s;mall Fortunes, and render them le&s;s capa|ble to &s;atisfy the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Bills, when returned upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That the <HI>Mortgages</HI> of <HI>Lands</HI> in the Partner|&s;hip <HI>cannot be &s;ued out</HI> by the Managers; becau&s;e there was no valuable Con&s;ideration received. Thus the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors having only the E&s;tates of the Signers liable, would not receive above <HI>Two Shillings</HI> in the Pound.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="004738_0013_100DD137AF2F9ED0">3<HI>dly,</HI> That the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors having had &s;ufficient War|ring from the Government, can claim none of their <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>We hope that the Government, who are the Parents and Guardians of the People, will act, as natural Parents do with their Children, guilty of &s;ome Follies, after repeated Admonition.</P>
<P><HI>In all Bubbles, Combinations,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the Guilt of the Projectors and Managers is from a corrupt Principle; but the Error in their Followers, the Multitude, is only from a Mi&s;take in Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I have now given you my Tho'ts of this &s;ingular Peice of Iniquity, in the mo&s;t impartial Manner I am able, and hope it will be &s;atisfactory to you, a&s;&s;uring you I am, with all poffible Re&s;pect,</P>
