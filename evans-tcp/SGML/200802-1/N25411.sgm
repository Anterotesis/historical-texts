<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FABLES are generally plea&s;ing to children. Since they are &s;o; were it not more advi&s;able to &s;up|ply them with &s;uch as afford <HI>le&s;&s;ons</HI> &s;uited to their age; than to wa&s;te our time in debating whether or no Fable-writing be the mo&s;t de&s;irable mode of in&s;truc|tion?</P>
<P>IF I were a&s;ked the que&s;tion, I &s;hould an&s;wer in the negative.</P>
<P>BUT let us con&s;ider that every book the little boy meets with at &s;chool, will pre&s;ent to him Fables, which he will &s;eize with avidity as novelties: Fa|bles, the morals of which are calculated to give an improper bias to his mind; had we not then better indulge him (whil&s;t in the nur&s;ery) with a few that convey &s;imple Morals adapted to the duties of child|hood? I think &s;o; or I had not written the&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Rou&s;&s;eau's</HI> remarks upon Fables, as making a part of the Library for Children,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However mi&s;taken, however dete&s;table, many notions of <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau's</HI> may be; there are u&s;eful maxims to be gleaned from his work re&s;pecting children. I wi&s;h the wheat were &s;epa|rated from the chaff.</NOTE> &s;eem to me ju&s;t: mo&s;t
<PB N="viii" REF="033728_0006_0FF91DE1A3356998">
of his objections militate &s;trongly again&s;t all the Fables I ever met with. If I did not hope that the&s;e are exempted from his charges I would not offer them to the public, &s;till le&s;s would I have pre&s;ented them to the dear little ones for whom they were written.</P>
<P>THERE mu&s;t always remain one accu&s;ation again&s;t Fables, namely, Fal&s;ehood; but &s;urely it is ea&s;ily explained to the children, that it is but their own u&s;ual favourite &s;port of, <HI>"making believe,"</HI> as they call feigning vi&s;its, trading, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> with no de&s;ign to deceive; yet, to guard again&s;t the &s;hadow of evil, I have been explicit on that point in &s;ome of the dialogues; le&s;t the little books &s;hould fall into the hands of any poor friendle&s;s child, and le&s;&s;en his regard to truth. Now I mention the dialogues, I confe&s;s that I am prepared for ridicule, &s;hould any but a tender mother open my volumes.</P>
<P>I WEAVE <HI>nets</HI> for <HI>in&s;ects;</HI> and if I &s;uit my toils to my game am I to be derided? Who but &s;toops with &s;atisfaction to lead an infant by the hand: Who but delights to adapt her &s;teps to its &s;hort and unequal paces? And &s;hall we be le&s;s tender, le&s;s indulgent to the unformed mind?</P>
<P>A JUDICIOUS mother conde&s;cends to prattle with her children; to mingle in their &s;ports; thus &s;he
<PB N="ix" REF="033728_0007_0FF91DE778A5ADB0">
infu&s;es ideas in their tender minds, whil&s;t &s;he en|gages their affections; yet without relinqui&s;hing parental authority.</P>
<P>No office is <HI>mean</HI> which concerns the health (<HI>cor|poreal</HI> or <HI>mental</HI>) of the ri&s;ing generation.</P>
<P>WHY then do I make apologies for my infantine dialogues!</P>
<P>DOES it proceed from pride? apprehen&s;ive of je&s;ts from tho&s;e who are not aware of their u&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>Folly!</HI></P>
<P>THOSE who are engaged in educating an infant, will accept them with &s;atisfaction; tho&s;e who are not, (nor ever were) will de&s;pi&s;e them, and all that can be &s;aid in their excu&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>TO MY LITTLE READERS.</HEAD>
<P>You have been good, el&s;e your mam-ma would not have bought a new book for you.</P>
<P>I will tell you a tale. Ma&s;-ter <HI>Brother-ton</HI> was a good child.</P>
<P>When he was three years old, he would bring his book, and learn to read.</P>
<P>He &s;pelt the words thus, b-r-e-a-d&mdash;bread, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>He was apt, and fond of his book.</P>
<P>One day I met with &s;ome nice, clear, large print let-ters; and I cut them out,
<PB N="xii" REF="033728_0009_0FF91DEE27C0BE18">
and &s;tuck them on card; then laid them thus, c-a-t&mdash;cat, d-o-g&mdash;dog; and he &s;aid the words at &s;ight.</P>
<P>Was not this nice?</P>
<P>Then it came in my mind to print with a pen for him; &s;o I made tales of the dog, and the cat, and &s;uch &s;hort words&mdash;Should you not jump for joy?&mdash;He did.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have &s;ent the&s;e to make a book for you, to learn to read in; but there is one now with a name too long for you to read <HI>(Imperial Spelling-Book:)</HI> it is full of prints, and tales in &s;hort words; &s;o that it mu&s;t be joy of a boy or girl to learn to read in it.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I had met with &s;uch a book three or four years &s;ince: I &s;pent a great deal of time, for want of &s;uch an one.</P>
<P>You all love a book, and are fond of prints.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="033728_0010_0FF91DEFBB5AABF0">
One day I bought a book of Fa-bles full of prints; but I found it was all in <HI>ver&s;e:</HI> it was &s;ad &s;tuff: I could not bear the Fa-bles nor the Mo-rals.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> (that was the &s;weet boy's name) had a great mind to know what the Hen &s;aid, and what the Ape did; yet he was &s;o good, that he would not a&s;k the maids to read to him; (as he knew that I did not like the book) but would look at the prints, and talk of them, and not &s;eem to wi&s;h to read.</P>
<P>As he was &s;o good (if you be good you will be &s;ure to meet with things to plea&s;e you) I wrote &s;ome Fa-bles in print, with my pen, to &s;uit the prints.</P>
<P>I told him that I &s;hould not have done this, if he had not been &s;o good.</P>
<P>Gue&s;s how full of joy he was! I think I hear you &s;ay, "I wi&s;h I could &s;ee them!"</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="033728_0011_0FF91DF222AC4820">
Now that is what I am in hopes you may.</P>
<P>"And will there be prints?"</P>
<P>That I can not tell: I think there will. But if there &s;hould not; yet you will be glad to have the book; you will know that there would have been &s;ome, if it had been right.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t learn to take things as you find them&mdash;to take with thanks what is meant to plea&s;e you; though it may not be quite what you wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h my book may have prints, as I know it will give you the more joy; I am glad to plea&s;e a good child.</P>
<P>This was wrote to teach you to be good.</P>
<P>If you be good your friends will love you.</P>
<P>If you be good, God will ble&s;s you.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE remarked&mdash;(but who has not <HI>felt?</HI>) that the plea&s;ure of a Fable, is damped to a child, by the tedious unintelligible Moral which is to follow.</P>
<P>A Moral, again&s;t which, perhaps, the complaint already urged, is much the &s;malle&s;t that might be alledged.</P>
<P>Perhaps the natural inference from it is <HI>&s;uch,</HI> that a child may be the wor&s;e for it all his life.</P>
<P>Perhaps it tends to teach him to be deceitful, trea|cherous, covetous&mdash;but the &s;lighte&s;t injury which I &s;hould apprehend, is a &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t at the idea of a <HI>Moral.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, having written a few Fables from whence unexceptionable Morals may be drawn, I cho&s;e to make the little folk them&s;elves &s;eem to di&s;|cover them&mdash;indeed, I took care they &s;hould be &s;uf|ficiently obvious for them to do it&mdash;and the frequent repetition appeared to me to be of u&s;e, as it would enable the child really to make the remarks which I put in his mouth, as well as inculcate more &s;trongly the notions which I wi&s;hed to infu&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHEN Mrs</HI> Teach well <HI>wrote the&s;e Fables and Morals in the year 1779, &s;he wrote them for the u&s;e of her own family.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now they are offered to the public, perhaps it may be proper to premi&s;e, that there is another &s;et of Fables adapted to the &s;ame prints&mdash;written for the u&s;e of an elder child&mdash;who is made to conver&s;e upon the &s;ubject (in the latter part of this little volume) by the name of</HI> George: <HI>the &s;econd &s;et of Morals going by the name of</HI> George's <HI>Morals.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mrs.</HI> Teachwell <HI>is apprehen&s;ive that &s;he &s;hall be blamed for rai&s;ing</HI> George's <HI>language above nature, when his early youth is con&s;idered&mdash;therefore &s;he explains her motive&mdash;</HI></P>
<P><HI>She cho&s;e to &s;end him to his Dictionary for an explanation of words&mdash;thinking it an excellent ex|erci&s;e
<PB REF="033728_0064_0FF9211D148D5270">
for him&mdash;Tho&s;e parents who want lei&s;ure or patience to direct &s;uch an exerci&s;e can explain the words; and &s;o make trial of the little reader's memory.</HI></P>
