<HEAD>FROM THE EVANGELICAL MAGAZINE.</HEAD>
<Q><P>AMUSEMENT HALL; or An EASY INTRO|DUCTION to the ATTAINMENT of USEFUL KNOW|LEDGE&mdash;By a Lady&mdash;12mo.</P>
<P>The title of this book led us to think that it did not belong to our department. But as it was &s;ent to us for our opinion of its merits, we thought it only ju&s;tice to give it a reading, and we mu&s;t acknowledge we were very much plea&s;ed with it. Whatever engages the youthful mind, and at the &s;ame time inculcates the prin|ciples of religion or morality, de&s;erves no incon&s;idera|ble &s;hare of prai&s;e. In the&s;e the author has &s;ucceeded; and &s;he has rendered her work &s;o intere&s;ting, that we found it difficult to lay the book a&s;ide till we had got through it. Her plan of improving the minds of young people in u&s;eful branches of education, unites plea&s;ure with in&s;truction. And it de&s;erves our notice, that whatever tends to in&s;pire with a contempt for what is frivolous, and to give the mind a ta&s;te for rational pur|&s;uits, promotes the intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity. A per|formance of this character may be ju&s;tly viewed as the handmaid of religion, endeavouring to bring the gay, the giddy, and thoughtle&s;s, within the reach of her divine and enchanting voice. This may be truly a&s;&s;erted in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, as we find, along with the convey|ance of u&s;eful knowledge, well-directed efforts to cor|rect vicious habits and propen&s;ities, and to point out the beauty and excellence of virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and actions.</P></Q>

<HEAD>Amu&s;ement Hall, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AMUSEMENT HALL, though not a &s;u|perb, is a hand&s;ome &s;tructure, &s;ituated in a delightful &s;pot, on a ri&s;ing ground, commanding a plea&s;ing view of the road and adjacent country. The &s;urrounding hills are inter&s;per&s;ed with hanging woods and &s;hady groves, the man&s;ions of the opulent, and the cottages of the poor: thus is the eye gratified with an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, while the diver&s;ified &s;cenes that it exhibits, afford ample materials for contemplation to a reflecting mind. The furniture of the hou&s;e is elegantly neat; the library, though not large, contains many valuable productions. Mrs. Smith, the proprietor of this man|&s;ion, is de&s;cended from an ancient family: &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this e&s;tate in her own right, be&s;ides an ample fortune left her by Mr. Smith. She is generous, though not profu&s;e; no object of di&s;tre&s;s is pa&s;&s;ed by unnoticed; &s;he di&s;tributes not her bounty through the hands of &s;er|vants, but vi&s;its the cottages her&s;elf, and relieves them that are in want, according to their various nece&s;&s;ities. As indu&s;try leads to happine&s;s, &s;he finds the Poor em|ployment &s;uited to their abilities: there are none idle in the village; the children are employed according to their different ages, and are taught to read and write
<PB N="4" REF="029987_0004_0FE3B59759E37CB8">
under her own in&s;pection. Her company is &s;ought by the lovers of literature: her conver&s;ation is ea&s;y and unaffected; &s;he &s;eeks not to kill time, but to improve it, and therefore never finds it hang heavy on her hands. By the cheerfulne&s;s of her temper, her hap|pine&s;s is made apparent to all; even tho&s;e, who follow a round of folly and di&s;&s;ipation, approve of her conduct, though they have not re&s;olution to imitate it.</P>
<P>Her &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Denew, is al&s;o a very amiable cha|racter, and has the happine&s;s of being united to a wor|thy gentleman, who&s;e manners and di&s;po&s;ition accord with her own. They are ble&s;&s;ed with &s;everal children. Amelia, the elde&s;t daughter, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every advantage which can be derived from education, good &s;en&s;e, and and an amiable di&s;po&s;ition. She was about ten years of age at the period, to which this little hi&s;tory refers, and had ju&s;t obtained permi&s;&s;ion of her papa and mamma to pay a vi&s;it to her aunt at Amu&s;ement Hall, which was about twenty miles from Mr. Denew's.</P>
<P>Upon Amelia's arrival, the following conver&s;ation took place:</P>

<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mamma was with difficulty prevailed on la&s;t &s;um|mer to part with me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your indulgence would &s;poil me; but when I returned home, my papa and

mamma were both plea&s;ed to find me &s;o much improved, and &s;aid, if my aunt reque&s;ted it, my vi&s;it &s;hould be longer next time. When your letter came, I jumped for joy; my brothers and &s;i&s;ters cried, "Pray, mamma, let me go&mdash;pray, mamma, let me go." Mamma told them, that they mu&s;t &s;tay till they were old enough to leave the nur&s;ery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. SMITH.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, it is time you &s;hould have &s;ome refre&s;hment after your journey; ju&s;t touch the bell, that I may or|der tea. How does your little friend Mi&s;s Laura do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was almo&s;t wild when I told her I had an invi|tation to Amu&s;ement Hall, and teazed her papa every day to let her come with me. He told her he could not take the liberty to &s;end &s;uch an ungovernable rude girl to you, e&s;pecially without an invitation. When I took leave of her, &s;he cried &s;o, I thought the poor creature would have broken her heart; but indeed, aunt, &s;he always does &s;o when &s;he can't have her own way: her papa is &s;o good, that he does n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> deny her any thing in his power to grant, and will not &s;uffer her to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on|tradicted; yet &s;he is not happy.</P>

<P>That is owing to her papa's over fondne&s;s, which pre|vents him from &s;eeing her faults.</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. SMITH.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear child, is not more to your advantage for your friends to &s;ee your faults, than for others, who might make the &s;ame remarks on you, as you do on Mi&s;s Laura? It is in love to you that your parents admoni&s;h and correct you, that you may appear amiable in the eyes of the world; and when you attend to their in|&s;tructions and reproofs, it endears you the more to them: were your mamma to leave you to do and &s;ay what you plea&s;e, I fear you would be as unhappy as Mi&s;s Lloyd, who, if under proper government, might, in every re|&s;pect, equal, if not exceed, my dear Amelia. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is greatly to be pitied; &s;he has lo&s;t her mamma: her papa is much engaged, and the poor girl is left to the care of &s;ervants, who are never to contradict her; &s;he is very lively, far from being of a bad di&s;po&s;ition, and, if &s;he had the advantage of good in&s;truction, not ungo|vernable.</P>

<P>Oh, my dear aunt, will you &s;end for Laura? You can make her happy, I am &s;ure.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe &s;he is a few months older.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith received, by return of po&s;t, a very polite letter of thanks from Mr. Lloyd, accepting the invita|tion, and expre&s;&s;ing the mortification he felt in not be|ing able to accompany his daughter, as he was about to &s;et off on a journey of &s;ome weeks, but would &s;end her the next day.</P>
<P>Amelia, impatient to &s;ee her little friend, was &s;tand|ing at the window when Mr. Lloyd's carriage arrived. She flew to receive her, and, on introducing Mi&s;s Lloyd to her aunt, &s;aid, "Now, madam, you have made me happy, for I do love Laura."</P>

<SP>

<P>Laura's grief is occa&s;ioned by my an&s;wers to her enquiries concerning our amu&s;ements. When I told her the morning was to be &s;pent in working and reading, &s;he bur&s;t out a crying, and &s;aid &s;he &s;hould with her&s;elf at home again.</P>

<P>I don't like your gardener, madam: my papa would have turned his away, were he as idle as your's: look at this piece of ground! &s;ee how it lies all in di&s;order, and covered over with weeds! it &s;poils the view of the whole garden; for it &s;trikes one's attention the moment one enters.</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. SMITH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amelia, take this book into the parlour; we &s;hall &s;oon follow you.&mdash;My gardener, ye&s;terday, was at work
<PB N="10" REF="029987_0010_0FE3B5AE75315AF8">
at this bed; but, by my orders, left it in the &s;tate in which you now &s;ee it. I was in hopes it might afford a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to Mi&s;s Lloyd, and it gives me plea&s;ure to find it has &s;truck you ju&s;t as I wi&s;hed it &s;hould. I have known you from your infancy; and with concern per|ceive, that to this hour your mind has continued uncul|tivated, as the piece of ground before you. Your exte|rior form attracts our attention; and you are ble&s;&s;ed with a large &s;hare of vivacity: from &s;uch an appearance we have much to expect: but I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, the prevailing qualities of your mind are &s;o many moral weeds; and you mu&s;t not wonder if they are &s;oon di&s;|covered, and &s;everely cen&s;ured. We are apt to pa&s;s by a hundred beauties unnoticed, if but one &s;triking defect appears, as you have ju&s;t now done. My gardener has taken peculiar care of the &s;urrounding beds; ob&s;erve the order in which they lie, and the various flowers that adorn them; all the&s;e you pa&s;&s;ed by unnoticed, in ob|&s;erve that this uncultivated plat &s;poils the whole.

<P>Madam, you &s;hock me with the picture you have drawn! yet I own, with &s;hame, it is too ju&s;t a likene&s;s of my&s;elf. Indeed, I love nothing but play, and abhor working and reading. I wi&s;h I was like Amelia; but I fear I never &s;hall be.</P>

In the afternoon Amelia repeated the following &s;tory out of Hume's Hi&s;tory of England:</P>
<P>Edward the third, when he retook Calais, after a &s;hameful revolt, was &s;o incen&s;ed, that he was determined to take exemplary vengeance on the inhabitants, and would not receive the town on any conditions which &s;hould confine him in the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e offenders. Edward was at la&s;t per&s;uaded to more moderation, and in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ix of the mo&s;t eminent citizens being &s;ent to him, to his camp, with the keys of the city, bareheaded, and barefooted, with ropes about their necks; and on the&s;e conditions he promi&s;ed to &s;pare the lives of all the remainder.</P>
<P>When this intelligence was conveyed to Calais, there was a general con&s;ternation. To &s;acrifice &s;ix of their fellow-citizens to certain de&s;truction, when they had all &s;ignalized their valour in a common cau&s;e, appeared to them more &s;evere than that general puni&s;hment they were before threatened with; and they were irre&s;olute in &s;o cruel and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a &s;ituation: at la&s;t one of the principal inhabitants, called Eu&s;tace de St. Pierre, &s;tep|ped forth, declaring him&s;elf willing to encounter death, to &s;ave his friends and companions: animated by his example, another made a like generous offer, and a third and fourth, till the whole number was completed. The&s;e &s;ix brave men, with ropes about their necks, thus appearing like malefactors, laid the keys of the city at Edward's feet, who ordered them to execution.</P>

Having obtained her reque&s;t, &s;he conducted them into her tent, ordered a repa&s;t to be &s;et before them, and, after making them a pre&s;ent of money and clothes, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them in &s;afety.</P>

<STAGE>The Art of Happine&s;s. (The World.)</STAGE>
<P>A good temper is one of the principal ingredients of happine&s;s: this, it is &s;aid, is born with us, and &s;o in a great mea&s;ure it is; yet often-times it may be acquired by art, and always improved by culture: almo&s;t every object that attracts our notice, has its bright and its dark &s;ide. He that habituates him&s;elf to look to the di&s;plea&s;|ing &s;ide, will &s;our his di&s;po&s;ition, and con&s;equently im|pair his happine&s;s; while he, who con&s;tantly looks on the bright &s;ide, in&s;en&s;ibly meliorates his temper, and, in con&s;equence, improves his own happine&s;s, and that of all about him.</P>
<P>Arachne and Meli&s;&s;a are two friends, both women in years, and alike in birth, fortune, education, and ac|compli&s;hments. They were originally alike in temper too; but by different management are grown the rever&s;e of each other. Arachne has accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to look on the dark &s;ide of every object. If you &s;hew her a new publication, &s;he &s;lightly &s;kims over the pa&s;&s;ages that would give her plea&s;ure, and dwells only on tho&s;e that fill her with di&s;like. Her garden is a very delightful one; but if you take a walk with her in it, &s;he talks of nothing but blights and &s;torms, of &s;nails and caterpillars.
<PB N="19" REF="029987_0019_0FE34DC95026F2E0">
If you &s;it down with her in the temples to enjoy a beau|tiful pro&s;pect, &s;he ob&s;erves to you, that there is too much wood, or too little water; that the day is too &s;unny, or too gloomy; that it is &s;ultry or windy; and fini&s;hes with a long harangue upon the wretchedne&s;s of our climate. In company &s;he ca&s;ts a gloom over all, by giving you the hi&s;tory of her own bad health, or of &s;ome melancholy accident that befel one of her daughter's children. Thus &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly &s;inks her own &s;pirits, and the &s;pirits of all around her, and at la&s;t di&s;covers, &s;he knows not why, that her friends are grave.</P>
<P>Meli&s;&s;a is the rever&s;e of all this: &s;he is cheerful her&s;elf, and communicates it to all about her. If any misfortune has befallen her, &s;he con&s;iders it might have been wor&s;e, and is thankful to Providence for an e&s;cape. She opens every book with a de&s;ire to be entertained and in&s;tructed, and, therefore &s;eldom mi&s;&s;es what &s;he looks for. Walk with her, though it be but on a heath or common, and &s;he will di&s;cover numberle&s;s beauties, unob&s;erved before, in the hills, the dales, the broom, the brakes, and the varie|gated flowers of weeds and poppies. She enjoys every change of weather and of &s;ea&s;on, as bringing &s;omething of health or convenience. In conver&s;ation, it is a rule with her never to &s;tart a &s;ubject that leads to any thing gloomy or di&s;agreeable; you, therefore, never hear her repeating her own grievances, or tho&s;e of her neighbours, or (what is wor&s;t of all) their faults and imperfections. Thus Meli&s;&s;a, like the Bee, gathers honey from every weed; while Arachne, like the Spider, &s;ucks poi&s;on from the
<PB N="20" REF="029987_0020_0FE3B5DAC78E3FF8">
faire&s;t flowers: the con&s;equence is, that of two tempers, once nearly allied, the one is for ever &s;our and di&s;&s;atisfied, and the other always cheerful.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Augu&s;tus, who was prone to anger, got the following le&s;&s;on from Athenodorus, the philo&s;opher: That as &s;oon as he &s;hould feel the fir&s;t emotions of anger, he &s;hould repeat deliberately all the letters of the alphabet; for, that anger was ea&s;ily prevented, but not ea&s;ily &s;ub|dued. To repre&s;s anger, it is a good method to turn the injury into a je&s;t. Socrates having received a blow on the head, ob&s;erved that it would be well if people knew when to put on a helmet. Another time, being attacked with opprobrious language, he calmly ob&s;erved, that the man was not yet taught to &s;peak re&s;pectfully.</P>

<P>It was entirely owing to peevi&s;hne&s;s and la&s;&s;itude, ari&s;ing from the want of exerci&s;e and employment. The poor have none of the&s;e artificial mi&s;eries; if they have food to eat, though coar&s;e, they enjoy it; for exerci&s;e carries off tho&s;e ridiculous vapours, which de&s;troy the appetite, and create endle&s;s complainings.</P>

<P>No; but we mu&s;t expect to enjoy more or le&s;s health and &s;pirits, as we u&s;e or neglect proper exerci&s;e; at any rate, we ought always to be employed. The di&s;tribution of happine&s;s is much more equal than we in general imagine; for it does not con&s;i&s;t in what we po&s;&s;e&s;s, but in the di&s;po&s;ition of mind with which we po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</P>
<P>In this book, which I have ju&s;t been reading, I have found a great, though poor man, and his views of po|verty &s;trengthen what I have &s;aid, that happine&s;s is more equally di&s;pen&s;ed than we are apt to imagine.</P>

<P>He was a Roman citizen; and being a virtuous ho|ne&s;t man, he was often employed in &s;tate affairs. At this time, he was &s;ent as an Amba&s;&s;ador, with others, to Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, then at war with the Ro|mans, to treat with him for the ran&s;oming of the pri|&s;oners, who honourably entertained them, and &s;ent the pri&s;oners back to Rome without any ran&s;om. Pyrrhus, admiring Fabricius, and under&s;tanding he was poor, endeavoured to win him over, by making him con&s;idera|ble offers, which were rejected by Fabricius with di&s;|dain.</P>

<P>But if he was poor, how did he &s;upport the dignity of an Amba&s;&s;ador?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. SMITH.</SPEAKER>
<P>While he was employed in the &s;tate, they provided him with all nece&s;&s;aries &s;uitable to the &s;ituation he was in; but I will read you part of his &s;peech to Pyrrhus: "It would be needle&s;s (&s;aid Fabricius) for me to men|tion the experience I have had in &s;tate affairs, as well as in tho&s;e of a private nature, &s;ince you have been told the&s;e things by others. You al&s;o &s;eem to be &s;o well in|formed of my poverty, that there will be no occa&s;ion for me to acquaint you, that I have neither money to put out to intere&s;t, nor &s;laves to produce me any in|come; all my wealth con&s;i&s;ting of a little hou&s;e, and a &s;mall field, which yields &s;ufficient for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Though I am not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, I never thought, nor can yet think, my poverty ever did me the lea&s;t injury. With regard to my fortune, &s;o far from repining at it, I look upon my&s;elf as the happie&s;t of men, when I compare my condition with that of the rich; and I even feel, on this occa&s;ion, a kind of com|placency and pride. My little field, though not over fruitful, furni&s;hes me &s;ufficiently with all things nece&s;|&s;ary, provided I do but be&s;tow the proper culture, and pre&s;erve the produce of it. Do I need any thing more? All food, when &s;ea&s;oned by hunger is agreeable to me. When I am parched with thir&s;t, it is luxury to quench it; and when I am fatigued, I take the &s;weets of &s;leep
<PB N="33" REF="029987_0033_0FE3B61363A050C8">
with exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure; I content my&s;elf with a &s;uit that &s;helters me from the inclemency of the weather; and, among the &s;everal moveables, which may be of the like u&s;e, the meane&s;t always &s;uits me be&s;t.</P>
<P>"It would be unju&s;t in me to accu&s;e fortune, &s;ince &s;he furni&s;hes me with all that nature requires. It is, indeed true, that for want of this affluence, I am pre|vented a&s;&s;i&s;ting the nece&s;&s;itous, which is the only advan|tage for which the opulent may ju&s;tly be envied. Even with my little, I a&s;&s;i&s;t where that little can be of u&s;e, and I do my fellow citizens all the &s;ervice in my power."</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SICK LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your kindne&s;s, madam, demands all the &s;atisfaction in my power to give you. My father was a man of large fortune; his name was Brown: I was his only child. My mother died when I was very young. My father &s;pared no pains or expence in my education; his love for me was great; and not any young per&s;on could be happier than I was, till I &s;aw Captain Smith, who gained my affections; but my father would not con&s;ent to the union. The Captain per&s;uaded me to ri&s;k my father's di&s;plea&s;ure, and become his, telling me, when once we were married, I &s;hould &s;oon be received into favour again;&mdash;that as I was his only child, he could not do otherwi&s;e. The moment I for&s;ook my dear father's hou&s;e, all happine&s;s fled. My father declared he would never &s;ee me again, and nothing could alter his determination. My hu&s;band, when he found that my father would by no means be reconciled, &s;lighted and neglected me, declaring he only married me for my fortune; and though I was young and hand&s;ome, his plea&s;ures were not to be confined, and that he wanted my fortune to pur&s;ue them; but, &s;ince he had lo&s;t his aim, he cared not how &s;oon he got rid of me. Ah, madam! you will ea&s;ily conceive what my feelings mu&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="029987_0038_0FE3B6290E6EA808">
be, to hear &s;uch a declaration from the man I loved, and had for&s;aken all for! I &s;pent mo&s;t of my time alone: books were my chief amu&s;ement; and the educating of my dear children beguiled many an hour: but the keen reflection of my di&s;obedience to my dear father, was the bittere&s;t ingredient in my bitter lot: had I followed his advice, I had &s;till been happy. He knew the cha|racter of the man I married better than I did, and all he told me has &s;ince proved true; but I could not be per|&s;uaded to think, that a man, who manife&s;ted &s;uch polite|ne&s;s, attention, and tenderne&s;s, could ever alter.</P>
<P>The la&s;t letter I wrote to my dear father, for I &s;till love him, and could I ever have thought that he would never more have &s;een his dear Eliza, as he u&s;ed to call me, not any thing would have tempted me from him; but I thought, as mo&s;t young people do, that his love for me would overcome his anger: the la&s;t letter I wrote to him was on the birth of my dear William, now three years old; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the angui&s;h I felt, when I received his an&s;wer, which was to this effect:&mdash;That he had a daughter, a once dearly beloved daughter, who had torn her&s;elf away from him; he had found it very hard to forget her; his hou&s;e, his gardens were a de&s;art without her, and though years had elap&s;ed &s;ince her de|parture, he was &s;till &s;olitary: he heard, from various per&s;ons, that his once beloved child was mi&s;erable, and that the Captain had avowed that he treated his wife ill, in hopes to ha&s;ten the old fellow her father's death, that he might get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his fortune. As that was the
<PB N="39" REF="029987_0039_0FE3B62DE71084D0">
ca&s;e, he intended to cut off all his expectations; he was upon the point of &s;elling his e&s;tates, and leaving Eng|land, that he might, in a foreign land, forget all that was dear to him in his native country;&mdash;as for her children, he never wi&s;hed to &s;ee them; they had a father to pro|vide for them.&mdash;I fainted with the letter in my hand. My cruel hu&s;band entered at that moment, read the let|ter, and rou&s;ed me by his &s;torming and raving; threat|ened to leave me, and the children, and flew out of the room. I had no re&s;ource left, but to weep over my poor, forlorn, helple&s;s infants. I dreaded his leaving me, becau&s;e I had no means of providing for my&s;elf and children, and equally dreaded his return.</P>
<P>My &s;trength, my dear madam, will not permit me to enter into a detail of the ill treatment I met with, till within a month of his death. One day he came to me, and &s;aid, he had been the ba&s;e&s;t of men to one of the be&s;t of women, but it would never be in his power to make me amends;&mdash;That he mu&s;t leave me for a time, and perhaps &s;hould never &s;ee me more, as he was going on a &s;ecret and dangerous expedition; but if he &s;hould return he would not treat me as he had done;&mdash;he was now &s;tung to his very &s;oul, to think he had driven my father from me. He then &s;aid, "My Eliza, take this," (which was a note of 100 l.) it is all that is left of your uncle's legacy: then embracing me and the children, with tears in his eyes, left the room, and I never &s;aw him more. The next news I heard was, that on his arrival on the continent, he was taken ill of a fever,
<PB N="40" REF="029987_0040_0FE3B6331845A750">
and was carried off in a few days. Thus was I left in accumulated di&s;tre&s;s: the lodgings I was in were ready furni&s;hed, and expen&s;ive: at the end of &s;ix weeks I di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed my &s;ervant, quitted my lodging, and came to this cottage, where my Eliza was nur&s;ed.

<P>No, madam; the fir&s;t time I &s;aw her was when the Captain was at our county town with part of the regi|ment; we u&s;ed to &s;upply them with fruit. Mrs. Smith took a liking to me, and being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for a wet-nur&s;e, a&s;ked me to take Mi&s;s Eliza. Ah! when I brought the dear little infant home, little did I think her mamma would die at my hou&s;e! Indeed, who &s;hould ever have thought &s;uch a lady could ever conde&s;cend to be in two &s;uch &s;mall rooms! though to be &s;ure they are neat and clean. When &s;he came, I was quite &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her &s;o ill, and offered to go and take lodgings in the town for her, for I was &s;ure mine were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it for her; but &s;he would not let me, &s;aid nobody could nur&s;e her like me,
<PB N="45" REF="029987_0045_0FE3B6486BCD8BF8">
and the &s;ituation of my hou&s;e would contribute, if any thing could, to re&s;tore her to health. I was &s;urpri&s;ed &s;he did not bring a &s;ervant with her, but &s;he was of &s;uch a &s;weet temper, that &s;he was plea&s;ed with every thing I did for her.</P>
<P>Here &s;he was interrupted by the return of John, who informed his mi&s;tre&s;s the coach was at the gate.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith took an affectionate leave of the children, promi&s;ing to &s;ee them the next day.</P>

<P>I e&s;teem the affection of my friends as my greate&s;t trea&s;ure; at fir&s;t, I own, I felt hurt, and thought my aunt would give us all up for the&s;e &s;trangers. (I hope, ma|dam,
<PB N="46" REF="029987_0046_0FE3B64CB83E4120">
you will pardon this ungenerous thought.) A lit|tle recollection brought right ideas to my mind. I put my&s;elf in their place, de&s;titute of father, mother, or friend, and every &s;elfi&s;h motive vani&s;hed. I was then willing they &s;hould &s;hare in your affections.</P>

<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Diony&s;ius the Elder was a prince of great political and military abilities, and had occa&s;ion for them all, in rai&s;ing him&s;elf, as he did, from a mean condition to &s;o high a rank. After having held the &s;overeignty thirty-eight years, he tran&s;mitted it peaceably to a &s;ucce&s;&s;or of his own election, and had e&s;tabli&s;hed his power upon &s;uch &s;olid foundations, that his &s;on, notwith&s;tanding the &s;lenderne&s;s of his capacity for governing, retained it twelve years after his death; all which could not have been effected without a great fund of merit as to his capa|city. But what qualities could cover his vices, which rendered him the object of his &s;ubjects abhorrence? His ambition knew neither law nor limitation; his
<PB N="49" REF="029987_0049_0FE3B6599DDA6908">
cruelty had often no regard to the affinity of blood; his avarice &s;pared nothing, not even the mo&s;t &s;acred places; and his open and profe&s;&s;ed impiety only acknowledged the Divinity to in&s;ult him.</P>
<P>The amazing precautions that Diony&s;ius thought nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecurity of his life, &s;hews to what anxiety and apprehen&s;ion he was abandoned. He wore under his robe a cuira&s;s of bra&s;s. He never harangued the people but from the top of a high tower, and thought proper to make him&s;elf invulnerable by being inacce&s;&s;ible. Not daring to confide in any of his friends or relations, his guard was compo&s;ed of &s;laves and &s;trangers. He went abroad as little as po&s;&s;ible, fear obliging him to condemn him&s;elf to a kind of im|pri&s;onment. The&s;e extraordinary precautions regarded, without doubt, certain intervals of his reign, when fre|quent con&s;piracies again&s;t him, rendered him more timid and &s;u&s;picious than u&s;ual; at other times we have &s;een that he conver&s;ed freely enough with the people, and was acce&s;&s;ible even to familiarity. In tho&s;e dark days of di&s;tru&s;t and fear, he fancied that he &s;aw all mankind in arms again&s;t him. He never went into the chamber of his wives at night, till they had been fir&s;t &s;earched with the utmo&s;t care and circum&s;pection. His bed was &s;urrounded with a very broad and deep trench, with a &s;mall draw-bridge over, for the entrance. After having locked and bolted the doors of his apartment, he drew up the bridge, that he might &s;leep in &s;ecurity. Neither his brother, nor even his &s;ons, could be admitted
<PB N="50" REF="029987_0050_0FE3B65E796A5570">
into his chamber, without changing their clothes, and being vi&s;ited by the guards.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of his greatne&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of riches, and &s;urrounded with plea&s;ures of every kind, during a reign of almo&s;t forty years, notwith&s;tanding all his pre&s;ents and profu&s;ion, he never was capable of making a &s;ingle friend. He pa&s;&s;ed his life with none but trembling &s;laves and &s;ordid flatterers, and never ta&s;ted the joy of loving, or being beloved, nor the charms of &s;ocial truth, and reciprocal confidence. This he owns him&s;elf.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this was not known to every one; it was hid under the glare of pomp; for one his of courtiers, named Damocles, was perpetually extolling with rapture his trea&s;ures, his grandeur, the number of his troops, the extent of his dominions, the magnificence of his palaces, and the univer&s;al abundance of all good things and enjoyments in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, always repeating, that never man was happier than Diony&s;ius.</P>
<P>What method, Laura, do you think Diony&s;ius took to convince him of the contrary of all this, without ever mentioning that he was unhappy?</P>

<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>

<P>He &s;aid to Damocles, "Will you ta&s;te, and make proof of my felicity in per&s;on?" The offer was accepted
<PB N="51" REF="029987_0051_0FE3B663867F5868">
with joy. Damocles was placed upon a golden bed, covered with carpets of ine&s;timable value. The &s;ide|boards were loaded with ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver. The mo&s;t beautiful &s;laves, in the mo&s;t &s;plendid habits, &s;tood around, watching the lea&s;t &s;ignal to &s;erve him. The mo&s;t exqui&s;ite e&s;&s;ences and perfumes had not been &s;pared. The table was &s;pread with proportionate magnificence. Damocles was all joy, and looked upon him&s;elf as the happie&s;t man in the world, when, unfor|tunately ca&s;ting up his eyes, he beheld, over his head the point of a &s;word, which hung from the roof only by a &s;ingle hor&s;e-hair. He was immediately &s;eized with a cold &s;weat; every thing di&s;appeared in an in&s;tant; he could &s;ee nothing but the &s;word, nor think of any thing but his danger. In the height of his fear, he de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to retire, and declared if this was happine&s;s, he would be happy no more.</P>

<P>Amelia, you give us a very unfavourable idea of kings.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. SMITH.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are not to form our e&s;timate of any &s;et of men by a few. Laura, read the following account of Cyrus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(reads.)</HI> Cyrus did not think a man worthy to reign over others, unle&s;s he was more wi&s;e and virtuous than tho&s;e he governed: he was al&s;o per&s;uaded that the &s;ure&s;t means for a prince to gain the re&s;pect of his courtiers, and of &s;uch as approached his per&s;on, was to have &s;o much regard for them, as never to do, or &s;ay any thing before
<PB N="52" REF="029987_0052_0FE3B667B25E3210">
them, contrary to the rules of decency and good man|ners. Liberality he looked upon as a virtue truly loyal; nor did he think there was any thing great or valuable in riches, but the plea&s;ure of di&s;tributing them to others. "I have prodigious riches (&s;ays he to his courtiers) I own, and I am glad the world knows it; but you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves they are as much yours as mine. For to what end &s;hould I heap up wealth? For my own u&s;e, and to con&s;ume it my&s;elf? That would be impo&s;&s;ible, if I de&s;ired it. No: the chief end I aim at, is to have it in my power to reward tho&s;e who &s;erve the public faithfully, and to &s;uccour and relieve tho&s;e that will acquaint me with their wants and nece&s;&s;ities."</P>
<P>Croe&s;us one day repre&s;ented to him, that by continual giving, he would at la&s;t make him&s;elf poor; whereas he might have ama&s;&s;ed infinite trea&s;ures, and have been the riche&s;t prince in the world. "And to what &s;um (replied Cyrus) do you think tho&s;e trea&s;ures might have amount|ed?" Croe&s;us named a certain &s;um, which was immen&s;ely great. Cyrus thereupon ordered a little note to be writ to the lords of his court, in which it was &s;ignified to them that he had occa&s;ion for money. Immediately a much larger &s;um was brought to him than Croe&s;us had mentioned. "Look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ere (&s;ays Cyrus to him) here are my trea&s;ures; the che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s I keep my riches in, are the hearts of my &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>But as much as he e&s;teemed liberality, he &s;till laid greater &s;tre&s;s upon kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion, affability
<PB N="53" REF="029987_0053_0FE3B66D78A15080">
and humanity, which are qualities &s;till more engaging, and more apt to acquire the affection of a people, which is properly to reign. For a prince to be more generous than others in giving, when he is infinitely more rich than they, has nothing in it &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing or extraordi|nary, as to de&s;cend, in a manner from the throne, and to put him&s;elf upon a level with his &s;ubjects.

<P>I will tell you, madam, what I heard of the grati|tude of an elephant. A drove u&s;ed to go daily to water; and a woman that &s;old greens particularly noticed one, and con&s;tantly gave it &s;omething from her &s;tall, as it pa&s;|&s;ed. One day, as they were returning from the water, the woman having left her little child, it had fallen off the &s;tall into the road, and would have been trodden to death, if it had not been for the elephant, whom the woman u&s;ed to feed, who &s;aw the child, and carefully took it up with its trunk, and laid it on the &s;tall.</P>

<P>What my &s;i&s;ter has related reminds me of one, who took a laughable revenge on &s;ome taylors, who were &s;it|ting at work with the windows open. An elephant put|ting his trunk into the window, the taylors pricked the end of it with their needles; the elephant went down to the river, and filled his trunk full of water (which they &s;ay will contain near a pail full) and came and poured it upon the taylors, to the amu&s;ement of all that &s;aw it.</P>

to take advantage of the ignorance of any, but will ra|ther a&s;&s;i&s;t them to obtain that information, the want of which evidently leads to mi&s;takes prejudicial to their intere&s;t.

<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam, about a curious cotton tree, from which our cotton clothing is derived. There are three &s;orts; one creeps on the earth like a vine; the &s;econd is thick, like a bu&s;hy dwarf-tree; and the third is tall, as an oak: all the three, after they have produced very beautiful flowers, are loaded with a fruit as large as a walnut, and who&s;e outward coat is entirely black. This fruit when it is fully ripe, opens and di&s;covers a down extremely white, which is called cotton. The &s;eeds are &s;eparated from the cotton by a mill; the cotton is afterwards &s;pun, and prepared for all &s;orts of fine works, &s;uch as &s;tock|ings, wai&s;tcoats, quilts, and conveniences of various kinds.</P>

<P><HI>(reads.)</HI> The king of Armenia, who was va&s;&s;al to the Medes, looking upon them as ready to be &s;wallowed up by the formidable league formed again&s;t them, thought fit to lay hold on this occa&s;ion to &s;hake off their yoke.</P>
<P>Accordingly he refu&s;ed to pay them the ordinary tribute, and to &s;end them the number of troops he was obliged to furni&s;h in time of war.</P>
<P>This highly embarra&s;&s;ed Cyaxares (who was uncle to Cyrus): at this juncture he was afraid of bringing new enemies upon his hands, if he undertook to compel the Armenians to execute their treaty; but Cyrus, having informed him&s;elf exactly of the &s;trength and &s;ituation of the country, undertook the affair. The important point was to keep his de&s;ign &s;ecret, without which he was not likely to &s;ucceed: he therefore appointed a great hunt|ing match on that &s;ide of the country; for it was his cu&s;|tom to ride out that way, and frequently hunt with the king's &s;on, and the young noblemen of Armenia.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="029987_0066_0FE3B6AAAEF57818">
On the day appointed he &s;et out with a numerous retinue. The troops followed at a di&s;tance, and were not to appear till a &s;ignal was given. After &s;ome days hunting, when they were come pretty near the palace where the court re&s;ided, Cyrus communicated his de|&s;ign to his officers, and &s;ent Chry&s;anthes with a detach|ment, ordering them to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of a certain &s;teep eminence, where he knew the king u&s;ed to retire, in ca&s;e of an alarm, with his family and trea|&s;ure.</P>

<P>This being done, he &s;ends a herald to the king of Armenia, to &s;ummon him to perform the treaty, and in the mean time ordered his troops to advance. Never was court in greater &s;urpri&s;e and perplexity. The king was con&s;cious of the wrong he had done, and was not in a condition to &s;upport it; however, he did what he could to a&s;&s;emble his forces together from all quarters,
<PB N="67" REF="029987_0067_0FE3B6AFD361A798">
and in the mean time di&s;patched his younge&s;t &s;on, called Sabaris, into the mountains, with his wives, his daughters, and whatever was mo&s;t precious and valuable; but when he was informed by his &s;couts, that Cyrus was coming upon his heels, he entirely lo&s;t all courage, and all thoughts of making a defence. The Armenians, following his example, ran away, every one where he could, to &s;ecure what was deare&s;t to him.</P>
<P>Cyrus, &s;eeing the country covered with people, that were endeavouring to make their e&s;cape, &s;ent them word that no harm &s;hould be done them, if they &s;taid in their hou&s;es; but that as many as were taken running away &s;hould be treated as enemies. This made them all re|tire to their habitations, excepting a few that followed the king.</P>
<P>On the other hand, they that were conducting the prince&s;&s;es to the mountains fell into the ambu&s;h Chry|&s;anthes had laid for them, and were mo&s;t of them taken pri&s;oners. The queen, the king's &s;on, his daughters, his elde&s;t &s;on's wife, and his trea&s;ures, all fell into the hands of the Per&s;ians.</P>
<P>The king, hearing this melancholy news, and not knowing what cour&s;e to take, retired to a little eminence where he was pre&s;ently inve&s;ted by the Per&s;ian army, and obliged to &s;urrender. Cyrus ordered him, with all his family, to be brought into the mid&s;t of the army. At that very in&s;tant arrived Tigranes, the king's elde&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="029987_0068_0FE3B6B45A925670">
&s;on, who was ju&s;t returned from a journey. At &s;o moving a &s;pectacle he could not forbear weeping. Cy|rus, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to him, &s;aid, <Q>Prince, you are come very &s;ea&s;onably to be pre&s;ent at the trial of your father.</Q> And immediately he a&s;&s;embled the captains of the Per&s;ians and Medes, and called in al&s;o the great men of Armenia; nor did he exclude the ladies from this a&s;&s;embly, who were in their chariots, but gave them full liberty to hear all that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When all was ready, and Cyrus had commanded &s;ilence, he began with requiring of the king, that in all the que&s;tions he was going to propo&s;e to him, he would an&s;wer &s;incerely, becau&s;e nothing could be le&s;s worthy a per&s;on of his rank than to u&s;e di&s;&s;imulation or fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>The king promi&s;ed he would. Then Cyrus a&s;ked him, but at different times, propo&s;ing each article &s;epa|rately, and in order, Whether it was not true, that he had made war again&s;t A&s;tyages, king of the Medes, his grandfather? Whether he had not been overcome in that war, and, in con&s;equence of his defeat, had concluded a treaty, by which he was obliged to pay a certain tri|bute, to furni&s;h a certain number of troops, and not to keep any fortified place in his country? It was impo&s;&s;ible for the king to deny any of the&s;e facts, which were all public and notorious. <Q>For what rea&s;on, then (con|tinued Cyrus) have you violated the treaty in every article?</Q> <Q>For no other (replied the king) than becau&s;e I thought it a glorious thing to &s;hake off the
<PB N="69" REF="029987_0069_0FE3B6B948DB26A0">
yoke, to live free, and to leave my children in the &s;ame condition.</Q></P>

I would put him to death.</Q> At the&s;e words Tigranes tore his hair from his head, and rent his garments: the women bur&s;t into lamentations and outcries, as if &s;entence had been actually pa&s;&s;ed upon him.</P>

<P>Cyrus having again commanded &s;ilence, Tigranes addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the prince to this effect: <Q>Great prince, can you think it con&s;i&s;tent with your wi&s;dom to put my father to death, even again&s;t your own in|tere&s;t?</Q> "How again&s;t my inture&s;t?" (replied Cyrus.) "Becau&s;e he was never &s;o capable of doing you &s;ervice." <Q>How do you make that appear? do the faults we com|mit enhance our merit, and give us a new title to con|&s;ideration and favour?</Q> <Q>They certainly do, provided they &s;erve to make us wi&s;er. For wi&s;dom is of ine&s;|timable value. Are riches, courage, or addre&s;s, to be compared to it? Now it is evident that this &s;ingle day's experience has infinitely improved my father's wi&s;dom. He knows how dear the violation of his
<PB N="71" REF="029987_0071_0FE3B6C1B3490358">
word has co&s;t him. He has proved and felt how much you are &s;uperior to him in all re&s;pects. He has not been able to &s;ucceed in any of his de&s;igns? but you have happily accompli&s;hed all yours: and with that expedition and &s;ecrecy that he has found him&s;elf &s;ur|rounded, and taken, before he expected to be attack|ed; and the very place of his retreat has &s;erved only to en&s;nare him.</Q> <Q>But your father (replied Cyrus) has yet undergone no &s;ufferings that can have taught him wi&s;dom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The fear of evil (an&s;wered Tigranes) when it is &s;o well founded as this is, has a much &s;harper &s;ting, and is more capable of piercing the &s;oul, than the evil it&s;elf. Be&s;ides, permit me to &s;ay, that gratitude is a &s;tronger, and more prevailing motive, than any other whatever; and there can be no obligations in the world of a higher nature than tho&s;e you will lay on my father. His fortune, liberty, &s;ceptre, life, wives, and children, all re&s;tored to him with &s;uch a genero|&s;ity. Where can you find, illu&s;trious prince, in one &s;ingle per&s;on, &s;o many &s;trong and powerful ties to attach him to your &s;ervice?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, then (replied Cyrus, turning to the king) if I &s;hould yield to your &s;on's intreaties, with what number of men, and what &s;um of money, will you a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the war again&s;t the Babylonians?</Q> <Q>My troops and trea&s;ures (&s;ays the Armenian king) are no longer mine&mdash;they are entirely yours. I can rai&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="029987_0072_0FE3B6C46D8F0660">
forty thou&s;and foot, and eight thou&s;and hor&s;e; and as to money, I have about three thou&s;and talents; all the&s;e are wholly at your di&s;po&s;al.</Q></P>
<P>Cyrus accepted half the number of troops, and left the king the other half, for the defence of the country again&s;t the Chaldeans, with whom he was at war. The annual tribute which was due to the Medes he doubled, and, in&s;tead of fifty talents, exacted a hundred, and bor|rowed the like &s;um over and above, in his own name. <Q>But what would you give me (added Cyrus) for the ran&s;om of your wives?</Q> "All I have in the world" (an&s;wered the king). "And for your children?" "The &s;ame thing." <Q>From this time you are indebted to me the double of all your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</Q> <Q>And you, Tigranes, at what price would you redeem the liberty of your lady?</Q> Now he had lately mar|ried her, and was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of her. "At the price (&s;ays he) of a thou&s;and lives, if I had them!"</P>
<P>Cyrus then conducted them all to his tent, and enter|tained them at &s;upper. It is ea&s;y to imagine what tran&s;|ports of joy there mu&s;t have been upon this occa&s;ion. Cyrus, before they parted, embraced them all, in token of a perfect reconciliation. This done, they got into their chariots, with their wives, and went home full of gratitude and admiration. Nothing but Cyrus was men|tioned the whole way; &s;ome extolling his wi&s;dom, others his valour; &s;ome admiring the &s;weetne&s;s of his temper, others prai&s;ing the beauty of his per&s;on, and the maje&s;ty

<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think &s;he ought to con&s;ider her poverty, and be thankful &s;he was not a&s;ked to do any thing wor&s;e; and if &s;he would not do that willingly, I think &s;he ought to be made.</P>
<P>Now, Laura, draw a compari&s;on between your&s;elf and Mi&s;s Lee's cou&s;in: before we condemn the conduct of others, we ought to put our&s;elves in their place. It would be as much below the dignity of Lady Mary to fetch Mi&s;s Lloyd's cap, as for Mi&s;s Lee to &s;weep her cou&s;in's hearth, though it would be the duty of each to &s;ubmit to their benefactors. Mi&s;s Lee's cou&s;in a&s;ked her to do only what &s;he her&s;elf was accu&s;tomed to do, and therefore thought it pride in her to refu&s;e. I own there was want of feeling in beginning &s;o ha&s;tily: and &s;he for a moment put her&s;elf in Mi&s;s Lee's &s;ituation, &s;he would have adopted a milder way of urging her point. My dear Laura's falling into the &s;ame error, is from the

&s;ame cau&s;e, not entering into the feelings of others. Though your father is rich, yet you have been taught that you have feet to carry you to your drawers, and hands to take out what you want; while Lady Mary has a &s;ervant &s;tanding behind her all the time &s;he is dre&s;&s;ing, to fetch and carry every thing &s;he wants. If you ever do any per&s;on a kindne&s;s, always do it as if you were the mo&s;t obliged; there is more in the manner of be&s;towing a favour, than in the favour it&s;elf; and, by removing every thing that gives pain, we imperceptibly bring peo|ple into our own ideas of things. Amelia, &s;hould you have treated Lady Mary the &s;ame? You are &s;ilent; don't be a&s;hamed to own the truth. I endeavour to fathom your hearts out of love to you; you have much to learn; but what will be of the mo&s;t &s;ervice to you is to know your&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t recollected the conduct of a prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our own nation, which will not be un&s;uitable on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion:</P>
<P>The Prince of Wales, commonly called the Black Prince (from the colour of his armour) who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his conduct and bravery in the battle of Poic|tiers, was not le&s;s admired, after the victory, for his mode&s;t and generous behaviour to his pri&s;oner King John. The evening after the battle, the Prince refu&s;ed to &s;it down with the King at &s;upper; but &s;tanding behind his chair, entertained him with his di&s;cour&s;e. As the king's thoughts were wholly employed about his pre&s;ent

misfortune, the Prince &s;aid to him, in a mode&s;t and un|affected manner, "That his Maje&s;ty had one great rea|&s;on to be comforted, which was, that the battle was not lo&s;t by his fault; that the Engli&s;h, to their co&s;t, had experienced him to be the brave&s;t of princes, and that God alone had di&s;po&s;ed of the victory; and (continued he) if fortune has been your adver&s;ary, you may, at lea&s;t, re&s;t &s;ecure, that an inviolable regard &s;hall be pre|&s;erved for your per&s;on; and that you &s;hall experience in me a very re&s;pectful relation, if I may glory in that title."</P>
<P>The king upon this, recovering him&s;elf, turned to the Prince, and &s;aid, with an air of &s;atisfaction, "That &s;ince it was his de&s;tiny to be vanqui&s;hed, and taken, in an action wherein he had done nothing unworthy of his character, he found great comfort in falling into the hands of the mo&s;t valiant and generous Prince alive."</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that when King Edward, father to the Prince, received the news of the battle, he declared, that his &s;atisfaction at &s;o glorious a victory was not com|parable to what he felt from the generous behaviour of his &s;on.</P>

<P>The year after he was &s;ent out with the army again&s;t Pyrrhus, their camp lying at no great di&s;tance, Pyr|rhus's phy&s;ician came to Fabricius by night, offering to di&s;patch Pyrrhus by poi&s;on, if he would reward him for it.</P>
<P>Fabricius in&s;tantly ordered him to be bound, and car|ried back to his ma&s;ter; and that Pyrrhus &s;hould be in|formed what propo&s;als the phy&s;ician had made again&s;t his life.</P>
<P>The king was &s;o &s;truck with admiration, that he is reported to have &s;aid: "Fabricius is a per&s;on of &s;uch virtue, that it is more difficult to divert him from the paths of honour, than the &s;un from his cour&s;e."</P>

<HEAD>CARE AND GENEROSITY. (By Mr. Smart.)</HEAD>
<L>Old Care, with indu&s;try and art,</L>

<L>Ten thou&s;and flocks his &s;hepherds told,</L>
<L>His coffers overflow'd with gold;</L>
<L>The land all round him was his own,</L>
<L>With corn his crowded granaries groan:</L>
<L>In &s;hort, &s;o va&s;t his charge and gain,</L>
<L>That to po&s;&s;e&s;s them was a pain;</L>
<L>With happine&s;s oppre&s;s'd he lies,</L>
<L>And much too prudent to be wi&s;e.</L>
<L>Near him there liv'd a beautious maid,</L>
<L>With all the charm of youth array'd;</L>
<L>Good, amiable, &s;incere, and free,</L>
<L>Her name was Genero&s;ity.</L>
<L><PB REF="029987_0083_0FE3B6F2A36C2550">
'T was her's the large&s;s to be&s;tow,</L>
<L>On rich and poor, on friend and foe.</L>
<L>Her doors to all were open'd wide,</L>
<L>The pilgrim there might &s;afe abide;</L>

<L>The bread &s;he broke, the drink &s;he drew;</L>

<L>Her gifts and glory la&s;ted long,</L>
<L>And num'rous was th' accepting throng:</L>
<L>At length pale penury &s;eiz'd the dame,</L>
<L>And fortune fled and ruin came;</L>
<L>She found her riches at an end,</L>
<L>And that &s;he had not made one friend.</L>
<L>All curs'd her for not giving more,</L>

He was pupil to Socrates, who one day car|ried him to a geographical map, and a&s;ked him to find Attica. It was &s;o &s;mall it could &s;carce be di&s;cerned upon that draught; he, however, found it with difficulty; but, upon being de&s;ired to point out his own e&s;tate there: "It is too &s;mall," &s;ays he, "to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in &s;uch a narrow compa&s;s." "See then," replied Socrates, "how much you are affected about an imperceptible point of land."</P>

<P>The Lacedemonian youth were taught to reverence and re&s;pect the aged, and to give them proofs of it upon all occa&s;ions; by &s;aluting them, by making way for them, and giving them place in the &s;treet, by ri&s;ing up, to &s;how them honour in all companies and public a&s;&s;em|blies; but, above all, by receiving their advice, and even their reproofs, with docility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the&s;e characteri&s;tics a Lacedemonian was known wherever he came; if he had behaved otherwi&s;e, it would have been looked upon as a reproach to him&s;elf, and a di&s;honour to his country.</P>

<P>I admire with what ea&s;e the Mi&s;s Smiths relate what they have read; and their being accu&s;tomed to make remarks on what they read, will be of great advantage to them when they grow up. I am much indebted to them for their endeavours to amu&s;e me: a day or two ago they brought me their game of arithmetic. I was &s;urprized to find even little William &s;o ready at ca&s;ting up the num|bers. Another day they pre&s;ented me with their game of geography, choo&s;ing me their pre&s;ident to a&s;&s;ign and di&s;tribute their rewards, each an&s;wering to the counters they took out of the bag; &s;o that they went through every county and principal town in England, Scotland and Ireland, with the counties watered by the &s;ea-ports, bays, and capes, pointing out each on the plain map.</P>

<P>It gives me plea&s;ure, Sir, to find that their amu&s;e|ments meet with your approbation. We are much in|debted to the Abb&eacute; Gaultier, and other learned men, who have conde&s;cended to enter into the playful ideas of children; &s;o that learning is no longer a ta&s;k, but a plea&s;ure; and what is attained by their own free-will makes an abiding impre&s;&s;ion on their minds.</P>

<P>But, at the &s;ame time, they mu&s;t have a good in&s;truc|tor. You, madam, have &s;o happily blended in&s;truction with amu&s;ement, that you can &s;carcely fail of gaining the hearts of your little pupils. They tell me the fir&s;t thing they attend to in a morning is reading the Scriptures: even here you have &s;tudied the peculiar propen&s;ities of youth, by forming the hi&s;torical parts into dialogues, and have thereby given your&s;elf an opportunity of con|veying in&s;truction of the utmo&s;t importance in a plea&s;ing and imperceptible manner. Mi&s;s Smith has been &s;o obli|ging as to lend me the manu&s;cript. Your Hi&s;tory of the Jews, from the time of the Babyloni&s;h captivity to the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem by Titus, in letters, as an Ap|pendix to the hi&s;tory of the Bible, is a part of hi&s;tory which I have long wi&s;hed children to be acquainted with, as it tends to illu&s;trate the &s;acred writings by &s;how|ing us how fully the prophecies therein contained were fulfilled in the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and the di&s;per|&s;ion of the Jews for their rejection of the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
